4 2018-01-02 23:59:22 Is #Bitcoin ‘s crypto market dominance coming to a slow end? In the recent  weeks, #AltCoins have shown less sensitivity to Bitcoin’s market swings. It would be interesting to see if this dynamic continues or if $BTC will establish its previously uncontested dominance back again.

9 2018-01-02 23:59:03 Crypto is not even a 1$ trillion asset. If even 2% of the world's money goes into it in the next 5 years, 50-100k easy.

15 2018-01-02 23:58:39 When $btc was unquestionable king with 65% dominance. I was tweeting that $btc dominance will drop to 5% . Now slowly I see people charting my prediction. Be careful , what I foresee becomes the reality over and over again. Stay with wisdom peeps.

61 2018-01-02 23:55:13 Well CoinBase provided that for Crypto, I think a forthcoming competitor will be the winner there after they slip up (IE: MySpace -> Facebook, Digg -> Reddit). The second revolution in Social Media is def. possible if said spoon fed conv. emerges.

65 2018-01-02 23:54:40 Yes sir
66 2018-01-02 23:54:35 isnt this a fairly standard constant in crypto? bitcoin goes up, alt coins go down...today was such a great case study of that happening. I'll be ready for the next one!

73 2018-01-02 23:54:07 Please wait. I am not ready!! I need to purchase more XRP before it comes out
74 2018-01-02 23:54:03 Agreed. I work for a bitcoin wallet with over 50% female employees (most of whom hold crypto). Granted, our user base is mostly male, but not it's not an overwhelming majority.
75 2018-01-02 23:53:44 By what metric do you define BCH as centralized and Chinese relative to other cryptocurrencies you favor?

80 2018-01-02 23:53:16 これは確かに意図的な売り板ですね。トロン陣営がまだ価格を抑え込もうと大量に保有しているTRXを売って価格調整を行っているように感じますね。アリババ側に配慮しているのかな、まだ安くしておいて日本の取引所上場で解禁するつもりかな
どちらにしても非常に楽しみなTRXです
81 2018-01-02 23:53:05 The way I thought about this 2 months back on the sly as well while on a date. Spent £50 on dinner, drinks and trip to the arcade. That £50 would have been so comfy in crypto right now 
82 2018-01-02 23:52:57 今はトロンしか持ってない！けどなんか昨日からビットコインが上がると言われているね(ぼくは持ってないけど)

85 2018-01-02 23:52:41 Those who complain about crypto's volatility forget that brokers have been offering up to 1:200 leverage in some cases for years. There is no difference between using massive leverage then betting highly volatile cryptos,yet few pudits complain about brokers leverage.. #trading

110 2018-01-02 23:50:18 Still astounds me seeing some of the questionable projects above $SYS M/C but also reminds me of all the upside potential it has! $BTC $ALTS
111 2018-01-02 23:50:08 Because I don't think it is "cheap" for it's time. The level of shilling is disproportionate to the level of actual work being done. If I had a lot of money, maybe I would throw cash at every decent project in Crypto, but I use what I have for what I consider exceptional projects
112 2018-01-02 23:49:59 Read somewhere that 30% of Koreans invested in crypto already
113 2018-01-02 23:49:56 Overheard some guys talking about investing in bitcoin in my gym today, guess this crypto thing is starting to go mainstream

120 2018-01-02 23:48:52 Great info, thank you. I'll check it out and see if I can do better than I am now.
121 2018-01-02 23:48:42 Trading bots certainly can't make even close to 3/4% daily on the scale that bitconnect needs them to make it. The scaling effect for trading bots is huge, especially in less liquid markets. $1k trades might be easy, $10 million trades in crypto market hugely moves the markets.

127 2018-01-02 23:48:14 Your really bullish on this coin. I'm currently looking for another $XBY performance
128 2018-01-02 23:47:52 Yes, but thats just my guess. It's not just the programming, they need to regain trust again too. But after everything is finished that will just be a matter of time. Looking at weeks is nothing for new crypto's
129 2018-01-02 23:47:48 Luckily I did my due diligence and got involved in presale but in future I would really like it one of my favourite crypto content creators reviewed these sort of icos ahead of time maybe? Or do you offer a paid service to get this info earlier?

134 2018-01-02 23:47:28 Today there is a lot of ppl that try to appear  to media as « crypto expert » « crypto guru ». It seems that a new kind of job is born with the crypto enthusiasm of 2017
135 2018-01-02 23:47:25 Novotny is like the CEO of JPM, James Dimon and the UBS president, Axel Weber: Ostansilbe against Crypto, but "internally", they play the game. CEO of Morgan, the Jap. gov. etc. is much more honest
136 2018-01-02 23:47:23 Been in since 400's! and it has just started! Long way to go.
137 2018-01-02 23:47:23 Appreciate the honesty. The nature of the community can taint a project. I was pissed about the punctuality with #Wraith but even so, too often greed precedes patience in Crypto. I don't plan on ever getting back to $XVG but I don't see anything wrong with them fundamentally.
138 2018-01-02 23:47:16 "The #cryptotwitter community"..... Ha ha ha. The foundation of all good and logical opinions that is.
139 2018-01-02 23:47:13 Nice. How long does it take you to verify my email when I sign up?

143 2018-01-02 23:46:52 It's jealousy. They're mad $xvg missed a deadline by hours? Big deal. Most crypto projects do miss roadmap dates. It's new technology and development isn't simple work.

147 2018-01-02 23:46:35 Tomorrow Jans list comes out
148 2018-01-02 23:46:30 My top coin picks atm
$KIN $DBIX $XRB $QSP
I'm still a noob at this and I may not be the wisest but I'd love to hear your top #Crypto picks
149 2018-01-02 23:46:22 Curious about your tactics!
150 2018-01-02 23:46:20 $bco is a decentralized exchange.
It is a different segment. It's competitors are $zrx $block $cob $knc etc.

I think decentralized Exchanges are cool in long term but since there is no fiat gateway opportunity and no reliable tethers and the adoption still low. We have to wait
151 2018-01-02 23:46:06 Which #Crypto will perform the best in 2018? 
$BTC $BTH $XRP #Ripple #Bitcoin $ETH $LTC $BURST $XVG $TRX

152 2018-01-02 23:46:04 @SatoshiLite Thank you for all you've done to the crypto space! Looking forward to seeing LTC mainstream and used for daily-transactions.
153 2018-01-02 23:46:00 よっしゃ！
1月中に、ワシも5000フォロワー目指すどーー！
154 2018-01-02 23:45:59 I love where the #Ethereum blockchain is going, not only that especially the #ERC20 coins that use that #blockchain - Cheers to #ETH & enormous growth! - #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #bitcoinnews #ether #coins #binance #coinbase #crypto
155 2018-01-02 23:45:54 Finally got around to trying the latest Verge Wraith release. I love it so far. Can't wait to see how it improves. $XVG is probably my favorite crypto and not just because I got in very early. Privacy is essential today. #xvg #verge #vergefam
156 2018-01-02 23:45:51 selling all my crypto
157 2018-01-02 23:45:33 Sounds nice. Thank you very much.
158 2018-01-02 23:45:32 Pointless vid. Presale & whitelist is closed and you can only get this on exchanges next month- so not sure what this is trying to achieve. I am a big fan of crush crypto reviews but I am noticing a trend where you and other content creators are reviewing better icos later.
159 2018-01-02 23:45:30 So cool how my $2500 became $7500 in just 3 weeks. In this rate, I'd have about 70K by the end of next year...... #crypto actually paying for my tuition lol

163 2018-01-02 23:45:14 The analogy was fruit vs bad fruit. You then shifted to fruit vs junk food. We’re arguing over the need of public debate publicly. LOL Could it be about power constructs? I think you don’t want to present your ideas on a platform disguised as not giving Peterson a platform

I wouldn't dare sell with kin kong crypto watching over us
167 2018-01-02 23:44:54 Or with your "xrpnewstandard" stuff. So again why not, but better be honest (with yourself) and understand that by promoting the antevision of traditional crypto you stirr up some hostile reaction.

171 2018-01-02 23:44:23 People are tired of empty meaningless promises aimed at earning much money here and now. 
That’s why we won’t go this way as it is going nowhere. 
We think about the future and the development of our coin.
#litecoin #blockchain #crypto #altcoin #bitcoin
172 2018-01-02 23:44:23 Too many people are pumping money into crypto cause they think it will make em rich. But you aren’t dumb so happy trading
173 2018-01-02 23:44:23 That’s always an option as well! Just depends on if your investing or trading.
174 2018-01-02 23:44:19 I like these photos news outlets use for “bitcoins” the whole physical coin thing really doesn’t line up with the crypto currency thing
175 2018-01-02 23:44:14 Is the gold rush over? We’ll see. I think there will be another stage in crypto-investing when we see blockchain technology actually begin to scale. Less speculation and more intrinsic valuation
176 2018-01-02 23:44:14 You are probably lying to yourself, since you can't possibly have missed the fact that crypto community shares, or used to share common values/vision. So yes, for some it is not only about tech or money, but also about censorship resistance and balancing the power of banks/cb.
177 2018-01-02 23:44:08 @crypto_seiya 早いですね...立ち位置ミスった、と気づいた時には周回遅れ、ですが猛追できるようにすぐ行動♪ 短期マーケット(銀行券要因)やFPと絡めて日本の金融教育に資するものにしていけたらなぁと。リプ頂けて嬉しいので、リリースしたらご報告にきます！

Invest in $btc and $eth first. They are the staples. Build a portfolio around them after you understand market, tech, and nuances which make each #cryptocurrency different.
207 2018-01-02 23:41:16 It’s still user permission required though, as is everything with Civic

210 2018-01-02 23:40:54 ça dépend vraiment du niveau de risque qui te convient je ne peux te dire mais un peu plus bas qu'un support en général c'est pas forcément dégueu
211 2018-01-02 23:40:48 I appreciate the offer and I just may reach out once in a while and ask a question or two.
What you and others do to help the newcomers to the Crypto world doesn't always happen in other businesses and is very much appreciated

221 2018-01-02 23:39:37 ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE BIG SHARKS ARE CLOSELY WATCHING THE MARKET...WAITING FOR IT TO DIP (OR PUSHING IT TOWARDS AN ACUTE DIP) SO THAT LOOSE HANDS DROP THEIR COINS AND THEY BUY EVERYTHING AT PEANUTS... THIS IS WHEN BTC will reach 1000,000 USD! #Hodl #BTC #XVG #XRP #TRX #ADA
222 2018-01-02 23:39:36 Still trying to determine why $ADA gets the number 5 spot? Did I miss a deal they closed? or is this another $IOTA situation....

224 2018-01-02 23:39:27 Can’t tell if your for waiting or not... time in the market > market timing - does that hold with crypto?

236 2018-01-02 23:38:30 There's also the very real constraint that managing a crypto currency is deeply energy intensive, so at this point it's not very scalable.

249 2018-01-02 23:37:04 i really didn’t get why more crypto founders don’t just create more coins outstanding. many laments view a coin with a per coin price in cents as “much cheaper” than something like bitcoin/ethereum at hundreds/thousands $ a coin
250 2018-01-02 23:37:01 Thanks for all you guys do at Coinbase and how easy you guys made it easy for me to purchase crypto. Please add XRP as well if you guys can.. would be a win-win
251 2018-01-02 23:36:54 This is a bunch of wank. xcuse my language but charts dont determine the direction of cryptos in an unregulated market. Media attention, marketting n endorsements create DEMAND for a coin. All three for verge right now are in the red!!

264 2018-01-02 23:35:41 This issue, specifically with regards to custodianship, inspired much of our research and writing on crypto funds. FWIW, I think the U.S. regulators by-and-large recognize this.

269 2018-01-02 23:35:30 But it’s the concept of crypto. Free from regulation, free from government, free from control and manipulation... they are just dead wrong. It’s quite the opposite.

290 2018-01-02 23:33:39 Coinbase wont be the only entry point for crypto currency and tokens. More options are coming specially decentralized ones.
291 2018-01-02 23:33:36 Because it’s a better crypto with better utility and better future tech than the others.
292 2018-01-02 23:33:26 This is why it’s great to have people like @CryptoChoe & @Haejin_Crypto in your twitter loop, the game is removing emotion, if you can achieve this you will become patient, if patient you will hold, it you hold you will sell at the best time!

298 2018-01-02 23:32:48 I think Progressives should support and help build these initiatives in the decentralized, open source, crypto realm.

301 2018-01-02 23:32:28 Etherdelta is ok.  I just bought a bunch of $KIN off there.  Just make sure you don’t leave it in the wallet.  I buy off ED then transfer right to meta mask in chrome.  Easy
302 2018-01-02 23:32:26 When Verge dipped to 11 cents on Xmas, I bought more 34,200 shares in total because I knew it wasn’t their fault. I was so glad to find out someone  purposely created a rumor for personal gain.

I strongly believe Verge privacy feature is the future of crypto currency !
303 2018-01-02 23:32:26 Jan 11 and 12th are key dates also ETN available to be purchased with fiat via Send Exchange. Jeff and co can you please cover this and any implications?

333 2018-01-02 23:29:20 Generally a fan of Revolut. However, you miss an important detail which is when you buy crypto through Revolut you don’t get the private key so you can’t actually do anything with it apart from sell it back in effect you don’t actually own the coin!! This is poor! @thomaspower

350 2018-01-02 23:28:08 The crypto taxonomy is arguably misaligned, possibly because we're still in an early stage of ecosystem development. For example, shouldn't Leeroy pay for great posts (content) by integrating with the BAT platform?

412 2018-01-02 23:22:59 @Ms_Bitcoin I know you might be new to crypto and want to make Bitcoin money really fast but you need to build a certain patience. Remember that some people sold Bitcoin at 100$ and they were already very patient. If you are not patient you will be upset real fast.

428 2018-01-02 23:21:41 I underestimated the community behind that $ARN. The majority of the community we’re looking to dump that coin. And thy did just that after it released on @binance_2017. Another lesson learned, take a careful look at the community behind a project.
429 2018-01-02 23:21:36 
430 2018-01-02 23:21:34 Unfortunately a coin i dont own at the moment. But it is on the list of #Crypto to watch and try and get in on a dip.

445 2018-01-02 23:20:02 Come on Andy. By following your posts, one can easily arrive to the conclusion that you are already a crypto multi billionaire by now. You don't need to charge $125 for your newsletters I guess!!. Or we have to conclude that you missed the BTC rally?
446 2018-01-02 23:20:01 I personally wouldn't get very excited. @CryptoBully Meh. Just another cryptonaire.

469 2018-01-02 23:17:42 Absolutely. Centralised control perpetrated by big banks with govt in their pockets (and vice versa). That's why crypto and everything it stands for is such a threat to them and their power centre. Crypto represents a shift in power more than wealth.

489 2018-01-02 23:16:18 Ultimately the real value of crypto-currencies should be the products, services and non-crypto marketplaces they are used for. Only one or two coins are ever really necessary for 'in house'  trading.

501 2018-01-02 23:15:27 What’s unfortunate is he doesn’t say where to hold XRP after you buy it. Crypto kept on exchange is not yours. He should update the piece and add to buy a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and transfer it there for long term holding.

521 2018-01-02 23:13:46 The answer is most likely a "no". Therefore it's an assumption.
522 2018-01-02 23:13:39 You cannot use as a medium of exchange a crypto that cannot at least retain its value.
523 2018-01-02 23:13:35 Good thing I know how to use Excel considering the new tax laws in crypto. These new trade laws are complete bs. It's obvious the IRS is completely uneducated in how cryptoCURRENCIES aren't stocks...

528 2018-01-02 23:13:20 For starters, they're consistently comprised of half-baked case studies that upon deeper examination don't hold much in the way of honest insight, nor do they make reasonable comparisons to what is actually happening within the crypto-world... so there's that I guess.

581 2018-01-02 23:09:16 HYIPの利用では，多くのHYIPに少額を分散して投資し，総額が多くなるようにすることが基本ですね。出来心でつい特定のところに多く預けると，痛い目にあいます。HYIPは明日飛ぶかもと考えて慎重に。

587 2018-01-02 23:08:42 Very often too big success of PreICO hinders the development of the project as it enters the market, because it doesn’t comply with the expectations and promises of PreICO in reality.

608 2018-01-02 23:06:53 @Coinbase is an embarrassment to the crypto community. Get your shit together, you bunch of clowns. /cc @CoinbaseSupport
609 2018-01-02 23:06:50 EXACTLY!  VS all the BS "To the moon" on new Years eve that caused a lot of us to sit here wasting time. I would have been happy to have waited if I known the deadline was pushed back a week.  Instead, they kept us pinned here by waiting on updates..  That is what ticked me off.
610 2018-01-02 23:06:37 Who is the market makers in the crypto world? Many cryptos that took a dip dipped together, went back up together. Just curious.  It seems to be fairly consistant.
611 2018-01-02 23:06:30 One day you will have millions. You will be more famous and much more valuable for the community than many of the coindesk nominees for the most influential crypto persons of the year.

618 2018-01-02 23:05:58 Had 4 times to sell for max profit but kept saying hold thinking it would easily hit 2000. That coin was highly manipulated and Twitter really killed it. Was hoping to hit 2000 on new years and self half of the stash and split that off on 4 other coins but it just didn't work out
619 2018-01-02 23:05:55 #HODL is the best choice in the growing crypto market over the next few years and there are many reasons to trust in #XVG Fast low fee transactions, decentralized, private and public option, open source etc. #VergeFam will not lose!
620 2018-01-02 23:05:52 @binance_2017 Any chance you could add support for fetching all trades through your API? Currently, the symbol pair is required, making it almost impossible to achieve this. We have a popular crypto portfolio tracker and many of our users are begging for this.

635 2018-01-02 23:04:16 Not liking what I’m hearing with the new tax laws for crypto traders 
636 2018-01-02 23:04:10 I thought the same but its good to be wrong ( u m not eating my hat Dan)  i still don't understand your message Roger about free ech.
637 2018-01-02 23:03:46 One key to my success in the near term is to have disciplined position sizes with little correlation. Staying balanced in different markets long equity positions with short positions, commodity, crypto, etc will allow a technical edge to play the out over a series of trades.
638 2018-01-02 23:03:31 @CryptoMessiah Any advice on diversification with crypto? Was wondering if there is a such thing as being TOO diverse with coins. Currently have 5 alts and am thinking about picking up a couple more, but thinking I may be holding onto  too many coins at that point.

646 2018-01-02 23:03:00 I know it's tough, but you have to realize that crypto can dip just as easily as spike and should only be done with SPARE money, not money you need to live. 

Especially xrp. It's centralized, manipulated, and not really even true crypto.
647 2018-01-02 23:02:56 The futute of crypto is this #Bitcoingold is the real bitcoin and #Bitcoincash is the future cash.

666 2018-01-02 23:01:57 For anyone relatively new to the #crypto space trying to find the next 10x coin - make sure to #DYOR before purchasing altcoin calls. There are a lot of sh*tcoins out there and the lack of regulation leads to pump and dumps. #Googletrends can help predict future growth as well.

718 2018-01-02 22:58:32 I DO get why everyone is so upset, but logically speaking, it's a lot to ask of an actual human being. Honestly, none of his behaviors have shocked me, I feel like I knew this is what I was getting into when I invested, so I'm not upset.

720 2018-01-02 22:58:19 Bro if that's happening to you please just buy like three alts ($OMG $NEO $ETC), hold, and sell in 3 months. There is absolutely no reason to get rekt right now in crypto.
721 2018-01-02 22:58:17 Hahhaha
722 2018-01-02 22:58:13 100% but BTC will forever be the “federal reserve” of crypto. We’re gunna have to link up and discuss. 280 characters ain’t enough lol
723 2018-01-02 22:58:06 I see... Not sure if this is plausible ATM tho as the support level of $TRX has increased already. But with crypto we'll never really know. It's just that this IS #TRON we talking about...
724 2018-01-02 22:58:04 only 3 types of #crypto "#traders" on twitter. All of them start with "...just did a #TA on crypto $X and its..." 
trader a: "...definitely going to #10x"
trader b: "...definitely going to #10x"
trader c: "...definitely going to #10x"
725 2018-01-02 22:58:02 Amen

737 2018-01-02 22:57:34 Haters dont know what they r talking about. Pump and dumps occur in over the counter markets every single day. Crypto is the flavour of the month as many others were before it. Because a thinly traded stock with a $10m market cap goes up 50% has and should have no effect on BTC

741 2018-01-02 22:57:28 but seriously, as history indicates, if companies do not move with the times, time will pass them up. I don't believe blockchain adoption is bad, in that sense. we still need services to pay for with our crypto ;)
742 2018-01-02 22:57:24 @SwagPoker listening to the first Blacks in Bitcoins pod. Good info and I still don't understand crypto currency, but that 189% ROI in 2 wks

745 2018-01-02 22:57:10 Best advise for those who don't have enough knowledge about techs behind crypto, market cap, or even they have a full time job.
746 2018-01-02 22:57:08 But we are expecting a coder/graffiti artist/introvert to learn how to behave like the ceo of a fortune 500 company all in less than a month, with no mentor. All while hes frantically trying to roll out a new program he has been the central dev on.

759 2018-01-02 22:55:49 FD now offering GPPs with Bitcoin prizes - how long before we see DFS sites accepting crypto deposits? Seems kind of ludicrous for winner of Bitcoin GPP not to be able re-use winnings on site, although maybe they’ll offer winners a ‘cash equivalent’.
760 2018-01-02 22:55:49 @crypto_butlers would love to see a post-pick review of $arn. It’s been somewhat underwhelming over the past 1.5 months or so.

I've been following you and the community closely (believer of XVG to the end), and just wanted to take a minute and thank you for everything.
765 2018-01-02 22:55:27 The best place right now to buy $DRGN is KuCoin.
766 2018-01-02 22:55:20 of course not, I learned from my mistakes :)

814 2018-01-02 22:52:20 that blog is a good technical analysis on xvg. theres fud on xvg making it really oversold. the RSI is under 30 so its a great buy. investors will take advantage of that low price to load up. once it starts moving ppl will have fomo and drive the price higher lol

817 2018-01-02 22:51:59 Under FAQ on the site, US citizens can't participate in the ICO if I'm reading it correctly.
818 2018-01-02 22:51:54 Its not that I disagree with your legitimate right to feel the way you do, but I just feel the reality of the situation isn't quite so straightforward on their end. I would doubt they had the money to pay for much outside help from devs until the past couple of weeks.

832 2018-01-02 22:50:49 "Crypto is worth nothing" is propaganda that will be endorsed by the gov soon enough as crypto is a fight back against the ever falling value of the dollar.

I am involved in various of these lending platforms and many crypto communities..
835 2018-01-02 22:50:39 Yeah, but it's not like a typical stock. The coins were dirt cheap until 12/15/17 and they didnt do a pre-mine or ICO. So i mean, I hear u, but I also think we didn't really "fund" them in the traditional sense. Whales funded them, if anything, arguably.

875 2018-01-02 22:46:15 Solution: XVG PR, marketing, twitter game needs major work! Easy fix too! NYE fiasco was avoidable, it was rookie, the world was watching.

899 2018-01-02 22:44:48 Not all crypto is btc to alt. And as time goes on more usd  alt will become a thing. Why? because a lot of newcomers don't like BTC. Why? because BTC is volatile as all hell.

1008 2018-01-02 22:37:20 Give a crypto noob a leg up!?
1009 2018-01-02 22:37:15 Unfortunately Europeans lack progressive way of thinking when it comes to tech. and in this case #crypto! Sad but true! #xrp #btc #eth
1010 2018-01-02 22:37:10 I'm  with you my friend!
1011 2018-01-02 22:37:06 Hey! Love your work, could i make a request for you to analyse Hyperstake (HYP/BTC) @Haejin_Crypto
1012 2018-01-02 22:37:05 Sell a third at 1k. HODL the rest
1013 2018-01-02 22:37:04 We havnt seen bitcoin's dominance fall to 37% since #theflippening with #eth. This is due to the influx of people in the crypto space and interest in alts. I'm sure we'll continue to see the dominance decrease as the market grows in the longrun, & alt coins popularity increases.

thank you
1017 2018-01-02 22:36:27 lol I feel you man. My crypto had outgrown everything else I own immensely. It's tough if you were an early adopter/still a big believer, but sometimes it's wise to at least to take some off the table. At least that was my thinking.
1018 2018-01-02 22:36:27 New level brings new devil

1019 2018-01-02 22:36:25 You said you would not bet on it. Then you said you hold a large stash of it. Considering you said BTC is the driving force of crypto makes me think you are a liar.
1020 2018-01-02 22:36:25 One of the @XVGWhale 's many spam accounts...
1021 2018-01-02 22:36:23 some one was calling xrp shit . I was talking about xvg with missed deadlines
1022 2018-01-02 22:36:18 The government can’t even get me to pay child support. Fuck I look like paying taxes on crypto
1023 2018-01-02 22:36:07 The casper project will take eth to the  top of market cap.
1024 2018-01-02 22:35:58 My first sell target is 1200, second I’m going to try at 1400, increased my bag Sunday so I may get rid of half and hodl the rest. I’m hoping for $1 by year end!
1025 2018-01-02 22:35:53 Why worthless? Would be super if you could recommend a better source for crypto news...
1026 2018-01-02 22:35:51 #xvg is massively undervalued. When the dust settles from all the crap going around this is going to jump #verge #hodl #crypto #WraithProtocol
1027 2018-01-02 22:35:32 You're changing the topic, you clearly said  a crypto should retain or increase value,  it's also clear no one would be trading if that were the case.
Trading and HODLing, as in long term , SoV type holding are two different things.
1028 2018-01-02 22:35:32 Lot more available then on #Trezor. And $ADA is rocking.

1032 2018-01-02 22:35:22 they have a person in "charge" but hes like Charlie Lee. The coin has a central Gov't but its self funded and people who own DASH are able to vote on proposals. I also like the idea of the evolution wallet you should look it up. Its probably whats going to make crypto mainstream

1035 2018-01-02 22:35:10 Question: Why does an online shop need a blockchain? I admit that I am new to blockchain and crypto, but I don't get it yet.
1036 2018-01-02 22:35:05 @etrade should make it that you can buy the top 10 crypto currencies. For sure their tech is way better than Kraken, BitStamp, GateHub....yaddy yadda yadda...the rest of em.

1052 2018-01-02 22:34:02 You're advising investors on how to buy XRP on an exchange called "Bitsane" without even explaining what the technology is or the risks involved and your response is "cmon man!"? @CNBC shooting from the hip on crypto investing will land a lot of people in a world of regret.
1053 2018-01-02 22:34:01 im not sure what a weed farm has to do with stocks and crypto.........

1055 2018-01-02 22:33:56 I want nothing to do with people into crypto that are also from my country. Yuk.
1056 2018-01-02 22:33:50 Yes, they own %60 of it. Only 40% in current circulation. They will dump and have their way with everyone who panic sells. It will be a rinse repeat cycle whenever they want. 

People can make money off it, personally I am going to ride the initial pump this year, then walk away.

I get that there's a maker and taker fee(let's just assume .25% & .25% for a total fee of .5% per trade). But at the end

1108 2018-01-02 22:30:07 depends on how risk adverse you are. Widely considered safer to hold larger percentage of btc/eth while alts bounce around. That being said I hold zero of either currently cause I prefer high risk/high reward. I love the pain. DYOR tho.

1133 2018-01-02 22:28:32 I agree with you. @Haejin_Crypto has always been on point with his calls. No BS pumping...he lets his charts speak.
1134 2018-01-02 22:28:31 For those recently joining the crypto market and buying alt coins in hopes of finding “the next bitcoin” let me remind you of a similar situation from ancient times....
1135 2018-01-02 22:28:21 In this environment moral hazard has increased due to ICOs and crypto. Biggest danger is not the scams but that equity investors feel stupid with even 30% return when they hear 1,000%, etc. But remember that eventually this is zero-sum + e and some will pay. @choffstein

1180 2018-01-02 22:24:27 I don’t love crypto-currency as a pure currency. Not yet at least. But  the incentive crypto creates for developing or owning equity in an open source protocol. Will result in a higher network value. And that's the biggest legal value prop blockchain provides today imo

1196 2018-01-02 22:23:07 I think part of what is driving the crypto bubble is wealth inequality so people are more interested than ever of becoming the 1% and view crypto as the "safest and fastest" way to it.
1197 2018-01-02 22:23:06 A PoW interchain would seem to be subject to the same sybil attacks as the other chains it would supposedly be helping. In fact it could be more of a centralized point of failure (which is why I never use checkpoint servers).
1198 2018-01-02 22:22:56 If this is true, everything we know about crypto is about to change forever. Thanks for the heads up!

1260 2018-01-02 22:18:07 The top 10% hold close to 80% of the worlds assets. I would probably higher if we excluded residential homes and included unconvential storage of wealth (of which crypto currencies are an example). So top 10 holding 90% should not be huge surprise #pareto

1279 2018-01-02 22:16:26 When did you start crypto? many people thought that over the summer and got rekt. Holding alts does not equal holding BTC. if you're actively losing BTC through your trades, you're better off just hodling BTC.

1285 2018-01-02 22:15:57 Got it!
1286 2018-01-02 22:15:55 hellow @communicable great to see you as a part of @AmbrosusAMB 

I have a question, can you consider making AMA on Reddit subforum? I red, that you will be giving us a post on blog, but you know, everyone in crypto reads Reddit :P
1287 2018-01-02 22:15:50 thanks for putting this all together. #xvg
1288 2018-01-02 22:15:50 I don’t have one yet but #xrp #ripple #xrp #coinbase will get me my first of many yachts! Thanks for the love my crypto brother!!!
1289 2018-01-02 22:15:45 yes after 1 full day 20 hours in the chart on the btc chart with leverage i can say yes will go down really deep and then 25K for sure bro !
1290 2018-01-02 22:15:44 Ya because why buy at 900 when you could buy at 1088. The lack of logic on Twitter is astounding..
1291 2018-01-02 22:15:40 U.S. as the now commands roughly 1,279 crypto-dispensing devices. not bad, I want one of these where I live though!
1292 2018-01-02 22:15:38 I have the strange feeling that something here is going completely different to the rest of Crypto-market...
1293 2018-01-02 22:15:35 omg they did it!
1294 2018-01-02 22:15:29 Patty McSmitty I would like crypto currency plz
1295 2018-01-02 22:15:18 I saw two. Would highly recommend Dunkirk.
1296 2018-01-02 22:15:15 Je ne pense pas que le bitcoin va augmenter autant en % que l’année dernière... Alt coins on du gros potentiel cette année!
1297 2018-01-02 22:15:12 i must admit, i'm a bit long in the tooth and not expecting too much, just a bit longer to enjoy the crypto rewards.  Not noticed improved eyesight.
1298 2018-01-02 22:15:10 Comparar a xrb com a dash é sacanagem. Xrb se continuar se provando, vai revolucionar todo o futuro da crypto. Pode ser criada uma nova entidade como a blockchain 4.0, seguindo o padrão da raiblocks onde cada pessoa vá ter sua própria blockchain a carteira...
1299 2018-01-02 22:15:07 the lannisters approve!
1300 2018-01-02 22:15:04 Cheers!
1301 2018-01-02 22:14:54 There ain't no Twitter like Crypto Twitter 
1302 2018-01-02 22:14:54 I have accounts everywhere I feel like I can act as a trading platform. Want some $DRGN? I’ll buy it for you 5% fee. Want some $TRX? Same thing. You name the coin you want to avoid opening an account for and you got it. #crypto
1303 2018-01-02 22:14:53 Bitcoin is the 401k of crypto. Get rich on alts, retire on BTC 
1304 2018-01-02 22:14:47 Guys I've decided that I'm going to be more active with crypto/trading calls on my other account @CryptoNigel so please give it a follow. This account will remain in an inhalent-fueled altcoin delirium so if that's why you're here then no further action is required. That is all.
1305 2018-01-02 22:14:45 If you survived 2017 with profits, you know what to do.
1306 2018-01-02 22:14:40 verge:DAsYrZ6LdU3oe4SwYY99i4XKFkHYtMomMp 

1307 2018-01-02 22:14:31 The game is dead. Zero sales. First crypto game was a ripoff. 
1308 2018-01-02 22:14:28 My risk management is a job, pention and equity in my house. The rest i let ride on crypto until i retire early or resign myself to work another 20 years.

1316 2018-01-02 22:14:00 Bron?
1317 2018-01-02 22:13:59 Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
1318 2018-01-02 22:13:51 Let down on a job opp today.  then #btc had a rally and I took some profits out of my alts and had my best day of trading since I begun.  #crypto thank you

1323 2018-01-02 22:13:38 Well they are really close to fixing all the issues as stated in the verge telegram group so im assuming (yes assumptions are the biggest fuckups) that there is no harm in waiting one more day - there will be an announcement once everhthing is finalised
1324 2018-01-02 22:13:36 Red hot? Nothing lol

1327 2018-01-02 22:13:26 If I were brand new to crypto I would get into $XLM and $TRX hard. I realize these are already popping off, but they still have a ton of room to grow. 2018 is the year of crypto.

1347 2018-01-02 22:11:53 Crypto market cap closing in on $670B!
All of this money flowing into crypto while $BTCs dominance is still sitting well below 40%. When it rises back to 50%+ we'll be in for a hell of a ride 
1348 2018-01-02 22:11:51 If he stops tweeting until we reach all time high I will donate 5000 xvg. I am not rich but I can do this to stop all bullshit he is posting about lambos and blah.. he has millions of coins wouldn't cost him much.
1349 2018-01-02 22:11:36 email wasn't scalable either when it first launched, give crypto (including bitcoin) a few years and it will become the norm and technology will solve any scalability challenges the industry faces or will be replaced by even more advanced next-generation tech for digital assets.

1424 2018-01-02 22:06:27 Please check with your tax professional, but it would be part of your annual tax return and so you would pay any taxes owned. However, if you owed more than $1,000 you may need to make estimated payments quarterly.

1445 2018-01-02 22:04:40 dude just keep trying. it was happening to me. happens to a lot of young exchanges.
1446 2018-01-02 22:04:37 A central entity has the power to manipulate. A rapidly growing crypto market confirms, people don’t trust central powers.
1447 2018-01-02 22:04:35 Right on. I just don’t know enough about any crypto-currency to make educated decisions in regards to investing.
1448 2018-01-02 22:04:29 Did you click apps and select Verge wallet to be opened with VPN?
1449 2018-01-02 22:04:26 Taking off. Go verge go!!!

1450 2018-01-02 22:04:25 Getting more comfortable with crypto everyday..

Researching and learning.
Observing and trading.
Holding and waiting.

What I’ve learned thus far gives me much hope and excitement for 2018..

Il y a quand même pas mal à dire sur les dérives de certains courants religieux et violents, ce seraient des cathos qu'on aurait pas le choix non plus
1458 2018-01-02 22:04:05 Hey @Presstab_crypto I would love to have a conversation with you about where proof-of-stake is at currently. Have we conclusively solved nothing-at-stake and Sybil attacks? Is a PoW interchain like $VRC / $VRM required? Is there a way to decentralize checkpointing?

1500 2018-01-02 22:02:06 I know...it is D or W...my eyes are bleeding too...I was caught by their message though...
1501 2018-01-02 22:02:06 BitsFromHeaven AwashInEchoes CoinSeer As is noted at the bottom of the article, that was a profitable trade. Of course in the big picture I did underestimate the explosive demand for ETH.
1502 2018-01-02 22:01:54 When
1503 2018-01-02 22:01:49 Officially announce it please!!
1504 2018-01-02 22:01:48 100% agree - there are the alt hodlers and alt-sell-to btc pumpers,I certainly belong to the 1st group.question though is : is btfd alt-time today already or rather buy tomorrow?
1505 2018-01-02 22:01:35 This is peak crypto twitter. Pack it up, we're done.
1506 2018-01-02 22:01:27 It says "most" so... in English that's usually indicative of majority but not an expression of all or a whole amount. 

Not sure what your first language is or what country you're in.

But I hope that helps.

1568 2018-01-02 21:56:37 Cryto fans don't seem to realize that crypto has no real practical use. Barely anyone is accepting crypto as a form of payment. But they all like to hype up the money they could make. Investing in crypto is a zero-sum game! The winners are simply taking away from the losers.

1606 2018-01-02 21:54:08 Name a crypto in the top 100 for the past 367 days that doesn’t qualify as a store of value. My point is; the point of a cryptocurrency’s existence should be at least to retain its value if not accumulate. Otherwise what’s the point eh?
1607 2018-01-02 21:54:08 Already 350% up since I posted 10 days back, yet so much upside left.
1608 2018-01-02 21:54:03 I love crypto currency dawg

Can anyone recommend any cheap coins under 1 dollar that one should purchase today, I have some extra money and looking to extend my portfolio
1610 2018-01-02 21:53:56 Dank je. Goed nieuws!!!
1611 2018-01-02 21:53:52 of course it is.. not
1612 2018-01-02 21:53:45 Hey remember when you all made a “quick buck” off your peasant amount of crypto cash out? Watch 2018 to the ones who held out, they bout to ball by this time next year.
1613 2018-01-02 21:53:43 My friends be watching the news hoping bitcoin go down so they can be right ...
1614 2018-01-02 21:53:39 national meda in poland speak too about btc
1615 2018-01-02 21:53:31 how u 'short' NEO?

1617 2018-01-02 21:53:29 @MercatoxCom Do we have an ETA on when operations will resume? I’m going to go play in the freeway if my funds disappear.
1618 2018-01-02 21:53:27 I agree me and my fiancé both have full time jobs. He day trades with crypto currency and we also have a real estate rehab buisness. I Game a lot plus go to the gym and stay in shape all while working 3rd shift.
1619 2018-01-02 21:53:27 Ive tested everything works fine.
Dont fall in the disgusting fuds of some idiot devs like monero etc. 
#vergecoin #xvg  will become top 10 coin soon.
1620 2018-01-02 21:53:27 I'm a Hodler, but I miss some officiality either in @vergecurrency and the web. If the Wraith protocol is officialy released, it should help to make it public by these means.

Long Life to Verge!

1623 2018-01-02 21:53:13 #noobs, like me - I EARNED MY TWITTER NAME DAMN IT.  Good thing #crypto time is 10x regular time or I'd still be a bleeder and not learned (veery quickly) to look long when one gets away.
1624 2018-01-02 21:53:09 follo1 Yes I think so, at least as far as public blockchains are concerned.
1625 2018-01-02 21:53:08 koeppelmann Quite meaningless to say that in the abstract imo, especially on a 12 month timeframe. If there was a reliable prediction market with substantial payoff in case of a win, I'd place a bet in favor of Bitcoin.
1626 2018-01-02 21:52:53 Ik denk dat ik ook gulden ga halen.

1634 2018-01-02 21:52:22 I liked the trade idea from mid .50 but sold on that Crypto day headline.
1635 2018-01-02 21:52:20 made for banks ... in this case XRP is the best crypto for cash payment
1636 2018-01-02 21:52:13 $alts : what a great recovery!!  #crypto #bitcoin
1637 2018-01-02 21:52:05 I looked into this a little more and the main site this runs on is called Steemit and is like Facebook where you earn their own made up Crypto currency for posting stuff and people upvoting it. You can then somehow convert this to Bitcoin. Far from mainstream but interesting.
1638 2018-01-02 21:51:55 Gotta be patient with this shit #Crypto shit
1639 2018-01-02 21:51:50 I hardly blinked.
1640 2018-01-02 21:51:49 Total #crypto market cap has increased ~60b in the last 24hours. With this pace trillion is passed in a week or two. Imagine how much everything will grow from this point in just ONE month, let alone ONE year.

Anyone who gets in now will make big gains. #cryptocurrency
1641 2018-01-02 21:51:48 This coin is awesome. So many big things are going tot happend. I'm nog the only one knowing this
1642 2018-01-02 21:51:47 Bitcoin was born out the Great Depression of 2008-2009 with the hopes of building something decentralized for everyone and Verge is a continuation of that. If centralization and stability was sought after, perhaps PayPal stocks would have been a wiser choice than Ripple
1643 2018-01-02 21:51:41 20% coin burn is pretty substantial, that was the highest-end of my prediction of how many coins would be burned (I figured 5-20%)
1644 2018-01-02 21:51:25 Yes, just hold it, you'll see! ;-)
1645 2018-01-02 21:51:24 How to Invest in #Altcoins simplified
1. Find a good NON-HYPED project
2. Accumulate Low
3. Sell into FOMO
4. Rinse & Repeat

1647 2018-01-02 21:51:16 everything is manipulated. noobs see huge sell orders pop up and the panic and sell thus lowering price for the whales to buy cheaper coins
1648 2018-01-02 21:51:12 The answer lies in the question... is #crypto good or bad for #Putin?

1655 2018-01-02 21:50:41 Someone who’s experienced in crypto hit my DMs. I have some questions.

1658 2018-01-02 21:50:19 Im sorry you felt this way. I still do gaming related tweets and content. Ive just been obsessed with crypto daily.
1659 2018-01-02 21:50:13 What a complete joke. The whole poiny of bitcoin and crypto is that there are no banks and other 3rd parties. Pack up and snort some more coke you degens.
1660 2018-01-02 21:50:12 Its incoming now.
1661 2018-01-02 21:50:09 Ardor est un de mes investissements préférés! C'est un coin que je hold depuis que j'ai commencé la crypto et dont je n'ai pas l'intention de vendre! Le projet est solide, la plateforme est puissante et sa facilité d'utilisation va attirer les foules!
1662 2018-01-02 21:49:59 All crypto traders need to know that  @hitbtc is a 100% SCAM!!!!!
#they charge over 150 USDT to withdrawal. 680 POE. 270 TRX. 

NEVER USE THEIR SCAMMING ASS
1663 2018-01-02 21:49:59 Yeah it will go past 1k sooner or later, at latest when the coin burn happens but probably before with the other news. 370 is the sort of range we will not see again I image, short of a huge BTC run in next week, TRX is getting too big
1664 2018-01-02 21:49:54 Thats awful!
1665 2018-01-02 21:49:49 Mahalo in advance  love me some #vergefam #xvg #hodlthru2018
1666 2018-01-02 21:49:45 Thanks mate 
1667 2018-01-02 21:49:44 Does this mean intentional manipulation?  Help a #noob out, have about 20% of my tiny portfolio in $KCS.  Thanks!
1668 2018-01-02 21:49:43 Done! Looking forward for great time with #XVG I believe in the project

1709 2018-01-02 21:47:28 One of these crypto "OGs"/"gurus" gotta be a government plant.

Who could it be ? 
1710 2018-01-02 21:47:22 Also, @needacoin and @notsofast are part of my "A" argument there cause they know how the markets fluctuate and are hardly scared about -10%
1711 2018-01-02 21:47:21 What Crypto Currency exchange do you use ? 
Heard @BittrexExchange was the best but they are no longer excepting new users.

1723 2018-01-02 21:46:45 The number one problem with crypto is that in 2017 it got flooded with new money and the new money doesnt actually care about the tech.
1724 2018-01-02 21:46:45 Will be top 25 coin within Q1 $xby

3) Save more money and invest small amounts in different crypto currencies when I can afford it

1730 2018-01-02 21:46:18 I can’t believe there hasn’t been an ICO like this sooner. I wouldn’t be surprised if this becomes the biggest ICO in history...

1747 2018-01-02 21:45:25 Any data to suggest public kerfuffle or even a congressional amendment to the new tax law re: crypto's impossible record keeping of taxable events requirements? Cannot be complied with! ICO's do not list the ETH USD value they accepted, etc! Will kill all but HODLers. @clif_high

1757 2018-01-02 21:44:42 I’m on the alt-holding site of the game here,so it makes most sense to buy the dips of selected alts with my remaining bitcoin right?@LuxAeternaPoker
1758 2018-01-02 21:44:38 As a #noob and former #alt #fomo bleeder I am 100% in alts - super high risk but my budget is so tiny that 20% btc gains over weeks/month(s) (these days) don't cut it.  If I had 10btc I'd hedge but until then it's balls out.

1780 2018-01-02 21:43:06 There’s been a lot of back and forth on the future of crypto currencies..utility tokens aside...actual currencies such as BTC which serve a medium of exchange and store of value will only grow in usage and adoption...my family is from rural PA and bartering was a common way to

1788 2018-01-02 21:42:26 I always love hearing from crypto vets. Gathering as much perspective as I can from those who have been around the block.
1789 2018-01-02 21:42:25 Gains are gains, never feel bad about that. The idea is to let the winners run tho, a lot of those positions will be up 200%+ in a week or less in usd and btc.
1790 2018-01-02 21:42:25 Yes Crypto is going to be one of mythemes to focus on for learning so I am going to read some whitepapers to understand better

1814 2018-01-02 21:40:41 Hey Fahad, Nice!
For my information, are there any changes in the BD gvt policies regarding #CryptoCurrencies? Or posession still is punishable?
Was crypto one of the subjects in this #PFlab?
1815 2018-01-02 21:40:32 $ELTCOIN #Eltcoin is a crypto I’m still unsure about. They just put out and Android wallet and it looks pretty fantastic, but their website leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions. At less than a nickel I’ll snag some, never know what may happen.
1816 2018-01-02 21:40:29 I'm not saying otherwise, calculated risks are part of the game, did you read the rest of the convo tho? Risk management.
1817 2018-01-02 21:40:28 You NEED $trx Tron tronix in there
1818 2018-01-02 21:40:17 All in is a good thing! We are changing the world , I can do  it with light hands, it's hard work and community support because this shit only go good for one when still good for many, if not nobody wants to get in ...
1819 2018-01-02 21:39:56 Listen, Crypto is moving very fast and #xvg is screwing the pooch, its open source dumb asses, the ideas  can be used by anyone, You don't think right now, that like 100 groups are not working on the same concept as #xvg and they will market correctly and do it right.
1820 2018-01-02 21:39:52 Are you real?
1821 2018-01-02 21:39:51 Have you seen Lynnette Zang's data on crypto and how it may fit into long-term strategy of central banks?
1822 2018-01-02 21:39:50 For sure! Always struggle with when to take profits. I’m starting to learn just to take them and forget about what happens afterwards. Still just dipping my toe into trading. I am much more confident in FA investments - and killing it so far. But I also want a trade bag for BTC.
1823 2018-01-02 21:39:45 Still Hodling!!  #XVG will have its day soon enough!
1824 2018-01-02 21:39:45 It's never had an issue. No one has ever lost coins on it. I have my crypto on it, never had a problem. They are simply the best.
1825 2018-01-02 21:39:44 Nice work! What's some of your favourite alts?
1826 2018-01-02 21:39:36 /s
1827 2018-01-02 21:39:36 Yeah I seen this many times before. Sometimes it works, but when bitcoin keeps rising you just caught a falling knive. Im waiting for alts to drop at least another 25% in sats.
1828 2018-01-02 21:39:29 unfortunately ongoing hype is needed in the crypto-space because people can hardly keep focus on one coin for more than a week or 2. (#3)

1868 2018-01-02 21:37:02 It's not that I'm saying $xvg is worthless. Im just saying they have lost some credibility and expectations are incredibly high. So please, be aware that you could be disappointed when Verge doesn't meet your expectations. #xvg #Vergecurrency #cryptocurrency #crypto

1871 2018-01-02 21:36:46 Lol jokes aside I'm fairly confident in the projects I invest in also mixed with proper risk management. From a crypto standpoint I'm basically always all in alts however you should never risk more than you can afford to lose.

1875 2018-01-02 21:36:22 Needacoin/notsofast, that's a bad message for newbs man, hahah. There's a big difference here in what you guys are doing.
1876 2018-01-02 21:36:21 Hi. Beginner in crypto here. What do you mean by making BCH "better"? How does one make a form of currency better?
1877 2018-01-02 21:36:21 That’s what it is about crypto currency and buying coins is everything fluctuates high or low! I’m looking to buy more ripple this week once I get paid I really don’t have that much into bitcoin only a little bit. I’m more or so in it for long term on ripple
1878 2018-01-02 21:36:19 And still, no BCASH advocate can ever answer that question. It's ok, silence speaks volumes
1879 2018-01-02 21:36:16 What's your suggestion for people who missed the trx train. It seems to be ATH right now. Do you see a dip coming up
1880 2018-01-02 21:36:12 Alts are dumping?

1888 2018-01-02 21:35:37 I lost all respect I had for him, the past 2 weeks.  Only Newbs fall for this crap.  Unfortunately at the moment, 80 pct of Crypto traders are newbs and sheep.
1889 2018-01-02 21:35:35 It seems unprofessional of a project to retweet someone begging for free money/crypto.  I like the project but this kind of thing from official channels worries me.
1890 2018-01-02 21:35:33 Altucher and Tai Lopez are litmus tests for crypto investing. If you get scammed by these guys, you're gonna get scammed worse by the real professional scammers out there. Best to learn that lesson early I guess ...

2007 2018-01-02 21:28:14 Peter Theil also funded ripple with his ventures firm, he's involved in xrp ... his buying up Btc to diversify and keep the price steadily cruising because he's now fully invested in crypto.

Big banks and money now own crypto, the decentralized nature has turned into new tech.

2031 2018-01-02 21:27:08 A reason systems display Zipf behavior is that they "grow in proportion to their size". This is why you see the same Zipf dist. in the wealth of individuals (in fiat as well as in crypto) - the "rich get richer" effect.  It makes sense that #crypto works this way in macro, too.

2035 2018-01-02 21:26:37 @BittrexExchange is banning all of you for pumping coins! :)
2036 2018-01-02 21:26:27 No, I understood that, but that's next to impossible, if not actually impossible. xD
2037 2018-01-02 21:26:26 Please stop spreading rumours.
2038 2018-01-02 21:26:11 I don't Al - haven't taken the crypto currency plunge yet. It'll crash as soon as I do though. Guaranteed...
2039 2018-01-02 21:25:45 It will be great revolut crypto wallet deposit and withdraw   please think about that. Wirex Centra Monaco gonna do soon @RevolutApp

2041 2018-01-02 21:25:35 This masive dump is mainly related to the lack of team Verge's official communication and the explicit interest of Mr. @XVGWhale and his hype without real knowledge.
You are absolutelly right though.

2045 2018-01-02 21:25:09 The biggest issues with tech in general is unreliable ignorance. When people don't understand what it is that a product is doing, immediately they use inexperienced labels when they're the ones at fault.
2046 2018-01-02 21:25:06 What if my trailing stop losses popped locking in a multi x gain while keeping a free bag? Am I good, or do I have to feel ashamed now?

2048 2018-01-02 21:25:00 Ryan is a great guy but the medium articles by @lopp and @jimmysong are better on the fundamentals of crypto
2049 2018-01-02 21:24:57 My feeling is more like we're at return to normal, but usually in crypto it skips the gear and goes straight to greed again lol.

2053 2018-01-02 21:24:35 blasphemy! burn the witch!
2054 2018-01-02 21:24:34 @Trading212 I’ve had my account with you nearly a week and every day you’ve suspended crypto stating it’s not safe to invest. Now it’s gaining in value and still not letting me buy in. Why are you so restrictive????
2055 2018-01-02 21:24:28 Done be sorry grandpa.

Patience is what you need in crypto :P.

cheers
2056 2018-01-02 21:24:26 Spent the last week taking profits and enough to set up 3 master nodes, they’re not down today like the rest of the Alts 
2057 2018-01-02 21:24:22 Read again. Or do you think guys likr notsofast and needacoin completely ignore risk and dont have any money besides alts/btc?
2058 2018-01-02 21:24:17 I would love to see it as a hint but i doubt he would risk his rep to tweet and give hint to make xrp surge and ppl start talking shit about him as a pumper
2059 2018-01-02 21:24:17 know what it is? its the TREND CHASERS that are bleeding hard right now. If you made good entries you should still be in the green. If you saw stuff go up 25%+ and thought "damn I need to jump on that bandwagon!!!" you are fucked today #crypto #altcoins
2060 2018-01-02 21:24:06 My crypto family let's take a look at the BEZOP ICO, I have not been this excited about any project since bitdegree
2061 2018-01-02 21:24:06 As always, the details make a difference. Cameron's years of work with Bitcoin, his family's housing drama, his impending graduation and this particular mainstream moment for crypto all made this the right time for his story.
2062 2018-01-02 21:24:04 Barbers know all the crypto Nazis at this point.

2070 2018-01-02 21:23:47 Way too many people are either all in or all out of alts/positions...coin moves 3/5/10x up just take some profits...add back on a pullback or re-invest/preserve capital...no reason to be going all out of alt positions when weeklies show major reversals...crazy stuff bros
2071 2018-01-02 21:23:45 How good of a computer do you need to be a miner? Any info on how to get started?

2082 2018-01-02 21:23:03 tiagocarolcrush there's no such thing. You just messed around with 3rd party tools you didn't understand
2083 2018-01-02 21:22:59 Facts bro!! Everyone's too busy looking at other people's wallets instead of focusing on their own!
2084 2018-01-02 21:22:58 Check my last tweet for Watson Reports... I believe this report is not correct...
2085 2018-01-02 21:22:56 you're on a different list ....  @crypto_birb   , @crypto_rand , @TheCryptoDog , @CryptoBully @CryptoYoda1338   ummmm ... maybe a couple  others are on "THE LIST" ... no other list is really good enough

2087 2018-01-02 21:22:36 What about ETN
2088 2018-01-02 21:22:35 Like other ways to influence alt coin prices are any better! I can't remember any reason other than the below 3 for price hikes in 2017: 
1/ "beta testing/partnership" news 
2/ fork aka free money
3/ listing on coinbase/major exchange

In sum, 99% of crypto market is vaporware!

2091 2018-01-02 21:22:19 Everyone in crypto is talking about buying Lambos. I don't want a Lambo. I just want a smallish house on a few acres of land away from civilization.
2092 2018-01-02 21:22:17 100% right!
2093 2018-01-02 21:22:15 CryptoJunky is now following me on #Twitter!
Welcome!
2094 2018-01-02 21:22:15 The other way around lol. 
It’s a lot easier to invest into crypto then to invest into stock.
2095 2018-01-02 21:22:14 Thanks
2096 2018-01-02 21:22:11 exactement! Jme disais comme toi mais j'ai vu pls crypto-monnaies intéressantes mais justement faut que je monte une  équipe 1/2
2097 2018-01-02 21:22:09 EGMontesano You have a valid point.
2098 2018-01-02 21:22:09 @crypto_baas thank you my man 
2099 2018-01-02 21:22:09 BTC is hanging in there. It’s gonna pull outta this slump at some point.
2100 2018-01-02 21:22:04 Oops. Too late to change now.
2101 2018-01-02 21:22:02 That's real shit right there. 
2102 2018-01-02 21:21:59 Hell yeah! 
i’ve bought 10k of TRX today, but i think that i’ll buy more next days...
2103 2018-01-02 21:21:59 tfw when you're up 3-4x profit in 3-4weeks but you can't take profit. geesh.

2106 2018-01-02 21:21:53 Why would young kids be reading about #crypto and #verge ? And if they can read I’m sure they have heard or seen a swear word before ? #xvg
2107 2018-01-02 21:21:47 He went all in on #XVG and has nothing left for other coins, blindly following your advice and hype.
2108 2018-01-02 21:21:46 Crypto will eat these bastards
2109 2018-01-02 21:21:44 Sorry. Saying that if you trade successful with 100btc in alts you one day might have 21 million btc. But then they are worthless.
2110 2018-01-02 21:21:43 Not true if you hold because you was to late and can act intelligent enough to hold your position and don't panic  more opportunities to come
2111 2018-01-02 21:21:41 Gotta unfollow about 50 people. Tired of reading about crypto every other tweet because some of y'all just found out about it.
2112 2018-01-02 21:21:39 Something has changed in silver past 8 months. Historical product relationships & patterns have broken down even on short-term basis.

I have personally wondered whether crypto assets have sidelined the 2nd tier precious metals.
2113 2018-01-02 21:21:32 I recommend @BitcoinBravado and @21Cryptos they have some amazing gems and finds. Bravado Subscription is only $20 monthly and 21Cryptos magazine is $10 a monthly issue. I am in no way associated with these companies. #cryptocurrency #Crypto #CryptoCurrencies
2114 2018-01-02 21:21:31 Please do so

2119 2018-01-02 21:21:14 #LTC #XRP #BTC #ETH what a great business looking for adoption from small men with whales putting up million dollar walls trying to take advantage and getting new money in. wow. anybody wonder why crypto at heart is not mainstream?
2120 2018-01-02 21:21:12 Thinking about how the goth fascination in post millennial counterculture is crypto-religious kind of in the way bad is good in ebonics. The new left wants an internally coherent anti-sex framework while still opposing "traditional"(protestant) values.
2121 2018-01-02 21:20:57 I went MIA in crypto land.

I'm back and ready break 1M this year.
2018 bless me with these rocket ships 
2122 2018-01-02 21:20:50 sobre o iphone x, eu meio q concordo com vc pq o iOS não está me deixando fazer trade de crypto moedas :/ A appstore bloqueia apps q fazem isso
2123 2018-01-02 21:20:47 $vee is going to change the game!

2135 2018-01-02 21:20:04 Problem might be that even if you are successful you won’t be able to pay anything with the 21 million btc you have in the end
2136 2018-01-02 21:20:00 Many are but as the world shifts to crypto then of course business based coins and erc tokens will stick around for benefits. Air travel, digital content, etc. BTC backs it all with ETH backing the tokens. The world is in for a shock
2137 2018-01-02 21:19:53 I relied heavily on that spreadsheet during the summer of 2007. It was a thing of beauty.
2138 2018-01-02 21:19:52 I’m the same. I just stared this lip balm business and trying to grow it and also do crypto
2139 2018-01-02 21:19:47 In crypto Bitcoin is the Benchmark.  Not the USD. That's why comparing to prices in BTC makes more sense imo.

2153 2018-01-02 21:18:38 Because @bitconnect is a scam, a coin copying that? Even worse!
2154 2018-01-02 21:18:37 I like Verge.... I feel like it's going to be weeks until it's up. No rush.

2167 2018-01-02 21:17:52 due to #xvg many people unable to buy #TRX bcz of Ur every time tweets we hold xvg and didn't buy TRX all investment we put into xvg and now u r telling us buy TRX.... I already knew it 10 days before TRX will definitely perform life rockt. But #xvg is only remain in tweets.

2169 2018-01-02 21:17:42 What the people selling Alts or the people crying about it?

2171 2018-01-02 21:17:40 T'was a brief moment with Bitcoin above $15,000 and the alts dropped

2173 2018-01-02 21:17:32 Thats true!
2174 2018-01-02 21:17:25 Thought of the day: Fees are what is going to sustain the crypto ecosystem when the limit cap is reached. Crypto that are focusing on zero fees right now will systematically disappear.

2185 2018-01-02 21:16:29 Buy on a day where it is RED.  Not like down 1% but when it's down 10+%
2186 2018-01-02 21:16:26 If you're trading 100 btc worth of alts you're either A: not concerned because you know how the markets fluctuate and you have more from where that came from or B: dumb because ignoring risk management.
2187 2018-01-02 21:16:26 tout est dans la com
2188 2018-01-02 21:16:25 Thanks. I'm not moving a ton of money around. I started out just with a few bucks to experiment and see if crypto would be a worthwhile way to diversify my portfolio. But now I'm like "What are stocks?"
2189 2018-01-02 21:16:24 First sell-off 100k. Down to 60ks

2199 2018-01-02 21:15:31 really? you think "ordinary individuals" aka the average person is anti-bank - maybe you've been living in your echo chambers for too long but the majority of the world still uses banks and will for years to come -- most ppl don't hate banks, they just hate paying high fees

2202 2018-01-02 21:15:16 I suggested buying it earlier..... For the simple reason that it's name is Tron and Tron is awesome!
2203 2018-01-02 21:15:15 It's due to bank clearances, not to due with blockchain updates.
2204 2018-01-02 21:15:14 This. Only a few months into trading crypto but the advice some of these guys put out on twitter/YT is priceless.

2243 2018-01-02 21:13:20 Why would people honestly give a shit about stealth addresses when its already been implmented for many other privacy coins. They were interested in IP obfuscation. Which the core wallet hasn't got.
2244 2018-01-02 21:13:19 Coin_Shark Congrats Sir! You are killing it
2245 2018-01-02 21:13:12 I keep telling myself I need to stop using all my money for Crypto, but then again I wouldn’t be able to afford a rocket ship to get to the moon.
2246 2018-01-02 21:12:48 What role do these institutions have in a crypto world meant to sideline them and open world trade to everyone in the world regardless of banks or paypal or....?
2247 2018-01-02 21:12:47 Given my crypto and civil liberties work, I'm firmly in opposition to that self appointed global security blanket.

Nevertheless the reality is that the  will always try to retain this power. Hence contributing to the type of projects I do (see my bio).
2248 2018-01-02 21:12:41 Interesting observation
2249 2018-01-02 21:12:35 Why aren't you posting this from your real account? You actually created an account with a specific purpose, to spread FUD. You and your kind are embodiment of worst aspects of crypto world.
2250 2018-01-02 21:12:29 I still believe in this one even if the are quite a bit of fud about it

2263 2018-01-02 21:12:05 Crypto market is different than equity markets  even though eventually blockchain tech will be for profit just like companies listed on major exchanges. A strong dollar is good for stocks, apparently a strong bitcoin isn’t good for alts #cryptocurrency #bitcoin

2271 2018-01-02 21:11:24 1. send #xvg to a stealth address 2. check the transaction hash on the public blockchain explorer 3. realize #thereisnoprivateledger and your transactions are still traceable. No fake, try it yourself.
2272 2018-01-02 21:11:19 done. My address: DE9Wa811Pjoetob93nLhaAF2eezF8R1hQE
2273 2018-01-02 21:11:16 What is hype? Why couldn’t I have bought $XVG following the tech? Hoping #Wraith could offer new privacy levels? Nevertheless, Im learning to code so I can read it myself...instead of relying on Crypto fuckboys like ur self that is.

2276 2018-01-02 21:11:03 You can't will an asset to grow you absolute chimp. The reason there's hate is because new investors have blindly followed you into negative returns. You're their first crypto "guru" experience and they're losing money following you. Stop
2277 2018-01-02 21:11:00 I would not buy without any doubt....
2278 2018-01-02 21:10:59 Did u not see the technical analysis on steemit? Also, Mcafee had a massive following, they don't usually hack people with smaller accounts
2279 2018-01-02 21:10:52 That's what I'm saying. My profits dropped buy I know they will be back. Why not just by more??
2280 2018-01-02 21:10:39 Yeah i try to leave at least like a little of currencies if i think they might explode but I think at the recent prices of $VEN and $ICX you cant lose if you hodl so sold up some $XVG to fund those

2289 2018-01-02 21:10:16 I watched your video. You show about stealth addresses. You say nothing about IP obfuscation. Tor hasn't yet gone live on the 4.0 wallet. You're talking shit.

2302 2018-01-02 21:09:23 Hi there - My main focus is stocks but I do post my crypto trades and ideas in our channel as well, I trade cryptos with the bigger time frames and hold for longer periods of time, but the chart setups, risk/reward profiles, etc are all the same to me in both stocks and crypto 
2303 2018-01-02 21:09:22 True, I'd be hesitant of anything smelling of crypto.
But I still believe people can change, be better.

I was never a fascist, but I think it's beyond question that people can change when I did so dramatically.

2308 2018-01-02 21:09:06 That was a fast dip. Too fast. Wasn't able to fill all my buy orders.  Although for the noobies, must have felt like an eternity.
2309 2018-01-02 21:09:05 Saying that I was watching 30 altcoins all start to drop simultaneously relatively the same proportion as what BTC had risen - thats Bot behaviour working arbitrage  of the isolated alt markets.

2314 2018-01-02 21:08:42 2018 will be the year of crypto coins but I’m gearing up for outsized gains in crypto tokens as well. Don’t be left behind buying 2017 winners folks!  Ether platform tokens I believe are all undervalued once the platform moves on from its current vision phase. Diversify now!
2315 2018-01-02 21:08:42 Please watch my youtube video that I was live today and I explain this very clearly. You can also read the white paper to understand how the transactions are send.
2316 2018-01-02 21:08:33 Yes, but who came first speculators in the crypto space or "enterprise blockchain"? It is always easy to demonise the speculators, and without them none of this would be going on.

2322 2018-01-02 21:08:12 Its bizarre to me that no one company has developed an easy to use solution for both buying and selling digital currency. Such a hassle to have to use multiple providers to complete front to back transactions.
2323 2018-01-02 21:08:06 Only bad thing about @Ripple is that there is 99 billion of it and majority is owned by them which will be distributed 1bill each year per an article I read.

2325 2018-01-02 21:07:55 Wow!
2326 2018-01-02 21:07:52 It’s a crypto currency right?!?
2327 2018-01-02 21:07:52 How’s your mastertoad?
2328 2018-01-02 21:07:47 So not crypto in the cryptozoology manner? Or perhaps I am just transfusing crypto into pseudo. #EalingHour
2329 2018-01-02 21:07:46 Out of all the great things I did in 2017 the one I'm most proud of is getting my dad started in crypto
2330 2018-01-02 21:07:43 That means I could end up with £ directly from crypto. No more changing to and from $. I like the project already.
2331 2018-01-02 21:07:41 watch bitcoin prices bounce to record highs in the near term. It has consolidated, their % dominance of crypto market has fallen, ready for it to regain its share with more investors going in. Bubble has a long way to go
2332 2018-01-02 21:07:36 Bonsoir, ou peut on retrouver vos « call » ?
2333 2018-01-02 21:07:22 Be humble after that
2334 2018-01-02 21:07:16 Sad nem is not on this list
2335 2018-01-02 21:07:08 We are in pennystock bubble of crypto.
2336 2018-01-02 21:07:08 Grant programs are a great usage of funds for crypto projects: If the research/implementations improve the protocol, the ecosystem and/or the underlying token would grow in value, paying back the granted amount by far
2337 2018-01-02 21:07:06 
2338 2018-01-02 21:06:36 Are there any alt cryptos you have seen where long term prospects are bad? I’ve noticed all your TA is positive. Is this a case of “a rising tide floats all boats”?
2339 2018-01-02 21:06:34 I’m looking at a -11.73% 
2340 2018-01-02 21:06:33 Facts. Something else I've been thinking about is the opportunity to incorporate more internationalism/accessibility into the UX/UI of these products, since Crypto markets are global in an unprecedented way. e.g. considering the differences in UX of GDAX vs Binance.
2341 2018-01-02 21:06:28 Some of us did however have some buy order at the 38 and 50fib level ;-) Lekker hodl man :)

2343 2018-01-02 21:06:27 well i just traded all my Verge for both VEN and ICX lol ^^   will get some more XVG by the end of this month
2344 2018-01-02 21:06:26 Yes of course you can! Gas will still be generated as well
2345 2018-01-02 21:06:23 Waiting for the stoch to curl up. Crypto crazy
2346 2018-01-02 21:06:13 Loollllll
2347 2018-01-02 21:06:07 Is 2018 the year of $100k #BTC or the year of mooning #Altcoins? Let's hope for both and to really get crypto into the mainstream
2348 2018-01-02 21:05:57 Did it [ pray for me ]

2357 2018-01-02 21:05:13 leadthewise Feel free to share how the analogy isn't valid - I could definitely be overlooking something.
2358 2018-01-02 21:05:08 You do no their major selling point was IP obfuscation.... so I have no clue what you're talking about.

2360 2018-01-02 21:05:06 There’s room in crypto for @ least a few legitimate projects. Grow your project organically and the market will beat a path to your door.

2365 2018-01-02 21:04:55 I'm officially done. You know how I feel about crypto currency. If you feel it's a path to wealth go for it. I will always stick to the path of stocks.
2366 2018-01-02 21:04:52 If you have not-to-play-around quantities of money in crypto, use a cold wallet, please.
2367 2018-01-02 21:04:50 OK, maybe I have to look at some of the crypto stocks. Which ones merit attention in your opinion, Stewie? Thanks.
2368 2018-01-02 21:04:47 Looks like whales BTFD on $XRB today. Weak hands shakeout was successful. $CRYPTO
2369 2018-01-02 21:04:46 If you really consider yourself a crypto investor, then never forget your alts are trading against BTC / ETH. Always take your profits, as if you’re not up in your trading pair, you’re not making as much money as you could!

2378 2018-01-02 21:04:23 It's a bag of worms been opened for a while in both spaces. Frankly until the cryptocurrency wonks accept that even in their space the crypto is just short for cryptography I can't be arsed with the argument

2382 2018-01-02 21:04:06 Thanks for the TA!
2383 2018-01-02 21:04:02 All currency is artificial and has arbitrary value. The crypto bit does actually mean cryptography is involved though. #EalingHour
2384 2018-01-02 21:03:56 It is frustrating, dumping alts that are positioned much better in % terms than btc. The consensus is that you are shorting BTC when buying an altcoin - but they are isolated markets pairs which otherwise would not dive during a btc rally if people didn't sell.
2385 2018-01-02 21:03:55 no more stocks, time for crypto!
$LTC was awesome dip buy hope we get some good news soon @SatoshiLite

2398 2018-01-02 21:03:05 Well, I'm sure you're an alright dude but perhaps crypto isn't your thing unless you view it as the stock market and make money "short selling".......Just my opinion of course.
2399 2018-01-02 21:03:03 Totally agree , too much toxicity here in crypto. At the end of the day if BTC =$8T USD Gold 2.0 and XRP =$8T USD utility token for sending payments , does it matter who’s right ?

2404 2018-01-02 21:02:24 I do not see any fundamental reason for the 800% run on $XRP and the $92B market cap. $0.17 #Ripple sounded good to me in August and it still sounds good to me now. #smh #crypto #hype I suppose it's an easy way for Ripple to raise $billions every month.

2410 2018-01-02 21:02:08 USItech is a ponzi scheme.  Not trying to hate, but keep you from wasting money (or wasting others' money that "get in" too late).
2411 2018-01-02 21:02:04 $40 million drawdown on Bitfinex tether wallet in last 24 hours. All counterfeit money. Crypto marketcap up almost $100 billion in that time.
2412 2018-01-02 21:01:55 How do you know they aren’t planning on making a crypto currency investment at a later date?
2413 2018-01-02 21:01:49 @diosnegro @AdrianSantuario Corrí unas simulaciones y stay away de los crypto futures y de los crypto funds, en especial los de etoro, se va a la verga todo de manera brutal.
2414 2018-01-02 21:01:45 now that crypto is a viable asset class maybe less money will go into stocks and by golly ZH won't loook like a complete buffoon after all... 
2415 2018-01-02 21:01:44 Lol, came here to say the same. Coin base is already drowning.
2416 2018-01-02 21:01:40 Bitcoin's the past! Put all your money in Keanucoin, a blockchain-based solution for flipping over the cars of scabs.

2430 2018-01-02 21:00:20 I'm quite new to the crypto environment and was curious what methods you used to predict these price points. I'm familiar with short term predictions but not so much in the long run.
2431 2018-01-02 21:00:16 lol your worried about 3000 tron what u gonna buy some crypto dogs?
2432 2018-01-02 21:00:15 So I’m deciding to try this crypto currency thing I need ideas... #cryptocurrency #blockchain
2433 2018-01-02 21:00:14 Based on my crypto newb friends, it seems the idea that one gets rich from buying sub-penny cryptos is quite prevalent in the current market. "That's how you really make money!" This is the extent of many people's fundamental analysis it would seem.
2434 2018-01-02 21:00:09 Short term thoughts on #XVG: Both 7 and 25-day SMA crossed down and have been sitting in buying range since NYE. I think a lot of people hopped to #TRX and you’re going to see profit takers come back to #XVG shortly. Wraith is functional and clean. I’m loading up. #verge #crypto

I am going to be asking this a lot, because I think, before long, someone's going to confuse cryptography and crypto-currency, and then I'll point and laugh. We don't want that.
2438 2018-01-02 20:59:55 Some of these coins are hilarious. Like, in 2055 we will all be buying groceries with Bulwark?

2442 2018-01-02 20:59:40 Just be careful because Hitbtc is a very sketchy platform and there is some noise about it being a scam. I have also bought $Storm quick cheaply, but I am watching Hitbtc very closely for any bad news.

2460 2018-01-02 20:58:43 Great strategy, did just the same a few days back. Got me some nice gains. Still hoping the XVG train gets back on track. And yes, $VEN and $ICX will bring big gains in the upcoming months.
2461 2018-01-02 20:58:42 Yeah okay
2462 2018-01-02 20:58:42 Thanks Matthias !  
Sounds good. 
I am accumulating a bag of $coss since a while. 
New UI will bring $coss at the same class of $kcs and $bnb and in long term it might go beyond.
I expect a 10x gain in 1 month  and 50x gain if they implement fiat tethers and fiat gateway.
2463 2018-01-02 20:58:32 Yes, er zitten aan RDD wat haken en ogen. We gaan het zien, ik ben verder erg te spreken hoe TRX zich in media via @justinsuntron presenteert. Een verademing tov van Verge. Ik hoop dat men bij XVG meekijkt.  But still HODL!

2469 2018-01-02 20:58:05 That’s “IF” (a big IF) these “old crypto players” can time their entries to perfectly sell all of their #altcoins at highs and then buy $BTC BEFORE it breaks out. Then sell when it’s at highs and buy back into alts on the lows? 

You see how ridiculous that sounds?

2505 2018-01-02 20:55:17 Congrats. What is your estimate target range for $NEO, end of year 2018? Think it may go above $300?
2506 2018-01-02 20:55:14 alt coins have superior technology and are taking up all the investors. BTC is only so high because it's the standard for crypto atm and what we use to cash out per say. Trust me BTC won't thrive in the future, they have a LOT to catch up on
2507 2018-01-02 20:55:12 Thank you for proving my point - crypto noobs FOMO bought news about a billionaire who purchased $BTC 5 years ago without any context or research 
2508 2018-01-02 20:55:09 Btc would have to go to 60 k to match most of these alt short term runs. Buy the alt dip!

2520 2018-01-02 20:54:26 Bittcoin is by design hard to change. That's one of the characteristic that makes it a store of value. Feature not a bug. The transacting segment is being built with LN and smart contracts (QTUM RSK). It's blockchain is the most secure & has value even for a micropayment network
2521 2018-01-02 20:54:22 I have the same question.. and was wondering If you know or if you know someone that understands how  people figure out the value of a coin at its optimal level.. will it be $5, $10.. $300? And what effects this..
2522 2018-01-02 20:54:21 Me too
2523 2018-01-02 20:54:21 I've tested it many times. Both from the core 3.0 wallet and the core 4.0 wallet which are both supposedly monitored. None of the transactions shows. That node doesn't show every transactions made through those wallets.
2524 2018-01-02 20:54:19 Good luck everyone!!!
2525 2018-01-02 20:54:18 You are always posting crypto articles so i was just guessing you might. Already unloaded my limit for the day anyway. Thanks for responding

2534 2018-01-02 20:53:15 So apparently PBC called $AION .. honestly this is their first good call they’ve made since $ETH .

Of course I gave you this free call over a month ago and helped you lock up tokens for 300%+ bonus.  Thanks PBC for pumping our bags!!
2535 2018-01-02 20:53:14 nope, Crypto's so far rarely fit the standard models I don't know if better of worse but likely not standard.
2536 2018-01-02 20:53:14 Hey @coinspotau I'm guessing you guys tried customer service... From my research it seems @ING_news is one of the most progressive banks in relation to crypto and blockchain based businesses – I'd speak to them!

2543 2018-01-02 20:53:02 Environmentalism has really become a Trojan horse that crypto-Marxists use to drive home further authoritarianism & wealth reallocation. You're video provided wrongthink and needed to be purged (i.e. demonitized).
2544 2018-01-02 20:53:01 Why would #XVG tweet anything? I think they're a bunch of kids that saw a problem in crypto and found a solution. I think (in my opinion of course) this is their first crack at this... They can anticipate targets BUT.......
2545 2018-01-02 20:53:01 Ben vandaag toevallig in TRX gestapt! En Redd Hodl ik ook al ben ik daar wat sceptischer over ;)
2546 2018-01-02 20:52:59 Maybe even in the media attention fase, we have at least 1 article each week about Bitcoin here in the Netherlands on  of the biggest news sites.
2547 2018-01-02 20:52:56 started an fx and crypto acc this month...both same equity...see which one wins in 3 months...both for margin trading.
2548 2018-01-02 20:52:53 Suppose I give in to the premise that there is actually an "honest" crypto.  How would that work in a situation where communications and power are disrupted?  I see this cryto concept relying on utopian communications.  Enjoy
2549 2018-01-02 20:52:51 Ok forgive my newbness I have only been in the crypto world for a few months, what is a stake?

2556 2018-01-02 20:52:23 The  market cap of crypto-assets accurately reflects the amount of money that has been invested in them?
2557 2018-01-02 20:52:22 Dat is een goeie vraag Youp. Zelf denk ik dat het samenhangt met de drukte in het betalingsverkeer aan het eind van het jaar. Veel overboeking moeten nog even gedaan worden en dan helpt de kerst direct na een weekend daar ook niet aan mee.  Dank voor je begrip! ^Robert
2558 2018-01-02 20:52:21 Conversely,  crypto means cryptocurrencies if I say so.

2572 2018-01-02 20:51:15 U can put as much money as u can afford to lose, crypto currencies are very volatile.... it's your risk.
2573 2018-01-02 20:50:59 someone claimed using that site that the IP addresses are shown and etc. If you truely want to test it, run a wireshark or any other packet capturing tool to see if your IP address is visible.
2574 2018-01-02 20:50:59 You have to have one eye constantly on BTC to time these sell offs, if you work full time and sleep 8 hours a day then it's tough. 30 mins behind the Btc pump and it's too late
2575 2018-01-02 20:50:55 Feels the same as when I patiently held #GGP @0.52
2576 2018-01-02 20:50:54 Smart

2578 2018-01-02 20:50:50 Allow crypto-currency to pay on Patreon would not just secure Patreon future, but also skyrock Patreon to next level, I see a future only with crypto-currency, it is inevitable. #Create2018 @jackconte
2579 2018-01-02 20:50:44 Actually, if you compare ADA/BTC and ADA/USDT, you will realise the fall in ADA is mainly due to Bitcoin strength. A lot of "experts" on here don't realize you need to price and chart a crypto against Fiat currency.
2580 2018-01-02 20:50:38 Bravado’s free group is better than most paid ones. But paying for some exclusivity and shared knowledge from a group of people obsessed with crypto and trade full time, shouldn’t be chastised by people not willing to invest in their betterment.
2581 2018-01-02 20:50:34 Agreed
2582 2018-01-02 20:50:34 Word of advice to newbies I regards to crypto. If you have patience and steel balls. You’ll never need to panic sell.

2593 2018-01-02 20:50:07 I don't know if Livermore bubble charts are applicable to crypto. Institutional comes before public on this chart, but people that work for investing firms were not legally allowed to buy BTC for their clients, while the average joe can invest independently

2614 2018-01-02 20:48:48 Over trading never works for me either, so many times I've sold alts to try and buy the dip but it never works out right. Now my approach is to find solid alt coins that will appreciate over time, no shit coins. This allows me to feel confident of a recovery when BTC slows again

2621 2018-01-02 20:48:27 Market Cap $688bn.BTC dominance 38%.Means
1. More money flowing into Crypto. 
2. Investorsare  realizing that a store of value is just one of many use cases for blockchain.
3. 2018 will be the year of Alts.
4. The top 10 at end 2018 will include a maximum of 2 of current top 10.

2623 2018-01-02 20:48:24 I don't know what bothers me more - #alts panic dipping or that I missed a word in that crypto joke. 

"...AND get it to finally refresh". Dammit.
2624 2018-01-02 20:48:17 Yo crypto gat. I also like their call on zen cash. You dont like that one?
2625 2018-01-02 20:48:14 They yet to get TOR fully up and running on the core 4.0 wallet. So there isn't any IP obfuscation....

2634 2018-01-02 20:47:43 Who knows who u r? But I know u r the boss in crypto. .
2635 2018-01-02 20:47:42 If you have crypto or stocks that are down today I would rethink the investment. Good day for investments.

2640 2018-01-02 20:47:12 That’s why we measure our success against the market average, by which we out performed 4X 
2641 2018-01-02 20:47:06 Yeahhh... I rather take insights from a 4 year old monkey.
2642 2018-01-02 20:46:51 In time my friend. I’d rather dip into my fiat. :D

2654 2018-01-02 20:46:17 You're the only sneaker dude that tweets about crypto that I still follow. Most don't know what they're talking about lol but you're legit. You've got that entrepreneurial mindset. Love it. Keep doing you and cheers to a huge 2018.

2662 2018-01-02 20:46:03 you are able to see coin distribution and how many people are using the currency. You are able to see all transactions on the blockchain, but you won't know who the transactions are going to or where the senders/receivers physically are located.
2663 2018-01-02 20:45:57 At $1m I'll put one on my forehead and change my name to Cryptotyson.
2664 2018-01-02 20:45:56 Lets goooio!! 
2665 2018-01-02 20:45:55 Nope, I only buy tops and sell lows.
2666 2018-01-02 20:45:40 Evet benimde başıma geldi genel bir sorun galiba
2667 2018-01-02 20:45:35 I completely understand Crypto. But one thing I really don’t understand is how Lamborghini plans to keep up with all of these purchases from us $TRX owners?! #trx 
2668 2018-01-02 20:45:34 Peter, please promise me and all other Verge holders that you will not be in contact with MacAfee or try to pump the token through such means as buying out the person.  That’s like lies my government has told me.
2669 2018-01-02 20:45:26 THE TEAM OF #TRX WILL BRING OUR BANK ACCOUNTS TO THE MOON.

2670 2018-01-02 20:45:17 Okay... lets see in 2 days
2671 2018-01-02 20:45:14 Cryptocurrency is here to stay and will continue to grow but if you have an Entrepreneurial mindset, start learning Blockchain technology. It will disrupt multiple industries such as Logistics, Healthcare, Real Estate and many more. Educate yourself and take action.
2672 2018-01-02 20:45:13 Some of these crypto acronyms sound like fighting words at first glance. 
2673 2018-01-02 20:45:12 +1

2675 2018-01-02 20:45:00 Smart man, anything with links to #JackMa or #Alibaba have huge potential especially if it means being used by the Chinese population, just look at how much money is trasnferred on WeChat (微信）every chinese new year

2680 2018-01-02 20:44:50 I have a grand near enough invested in XVG. Not the largest but I'd rather not lose it. Do I want the coin to succeed, sure. Does it currently obfuscate IPs? No.... because it isn't currently working with TOR. It's more damaging saying something works when it clearly doesn't.
2681 2018-01-02 20:44:49 There is no lack of opportunities in crypto. That's for sure.
2682 2018-01-02 20:44:47 @CryptoNickk  hi im  new to crypto just did my 1st loan on bitconnect. thx for the ytube vid they help a lot im a fan now !! Love to be in the draw

2684 2018-01-02 20:44:45 my dad got into #crypto today. Started him off on just trading $BTC/FAIT aka the bluechip of crypto aka it won't all vapourize in one day aka mom won't be super pissed lol.
2685 2018-01-02 20:44:44 I sense news is close - patience will be rewarded and holding £47k I’m excited 
2686 2018-01-02 20:44:36 @binance_2017 not today it isn't number 1 
2687 2018-01-02 20:44:27 Where is ADA?????
2688 2018-01-02 20:44:23 @VentureCoinist in addition. This seems like an amazing 'trick' I just checked 30 coins I track. And ALL of them did hit the 38fib and instantly got back up to 23fib. Some did hit the 50 fib but also got back up too. Ofcourse a lot of stop losses there but wow...
2689 2018-01-02 20:44:17 Man, watching emotional traders and noobs get #rekt might be one of the more entertaining things in crypto.  The sheer panic that is caused by a 2 hour btc run is hilarious.
2690 2018-01-02 20:44:13 Its crazy how much shit talking is coming from the BTC investors towards ripple... Its almost like they DONT want another crypto doing well!
2691 2018-01-02 20:44:13 I will join you guys at 1M
2692 2018-01-02 20:44:01 We are more around bear trap i think
2693 2018-01-02 20:43:59 Another thing is that crypto let's you practice with pretty low cost, make a TA trade and learn.
2694 2018-01-02 20:43:58 I'm very bullish on BTC, but can't imagine that it is still in the stealth phase. Closer to the late awareness phase imo
2695 2018-01-02 20:43:54 LOLZ. If you think I alone can make crypto currencies tank, I should do it more often... could make a fortune.
2696 2018-01-02 20:43:39 It has became a classic now
2697 2018-01-02 20:43:36 U sure u aint me? Same here 
2698 2018-01-02 20:43:36 Hi @BTCMarkets team, I wonder if you are planning to support additional crypto assets like NEM, Cardano etc. in the near future. Thanks
2699 2018-01-02 20:43:33 100% , alt coins are right in the buy time! #ALTS
2700 2018-01-02 20:43:32 I cant....its still few year ahead of today :(
2701 2018-01-02 20:43:32 That's not true Cobain, I know many crypto people that don't even get on twitter since it has become full of shill accounts.
2702 2018-01-02 20:43:30 "if you decide to take profits"?  I would say if you decide to GIVE UP profits lol but thats just me
2703 2018-01-02 20:43:28 Yes, that's maximizing your profits. But can you tell the future to know when the dips is over?
2704 2018-01-02 20:43:26 I've heard it's a bubble
2705 2018-01-02 20:43:23 Japonlar uyandı
2706 2018-01-02 20:43:19 Where is ICX? This should be on top of the list!
2707 2018-01-02 20:43:15 Same as most other arguments people aim at crypto
2708 2018-01-02 20:43:13 You should join to become a porn bull star. XD

2710 2018-01-02 20:43:05 my little sister drives a hot red sports car. Its so tempting to try to keep up but I will be able to get everyone one for xmas in a few years if I just HODL that crypto instead:)
2711 2018-01-02 20:43:04 
2712 2018-01-02 20:43:03 I truly believe $XVG haters are the stupidest group of whiny, entitled, spoiled little children I've ever encountered. Their ignorance is astounding. Only reason I don't block them all, is because they motivate me and remind me how not to be. Grow up and let's get money together.

2715 2018-01-02 20:42:48 @NetworkToken Hi, can you briefly describe the purpose of your token?

Yes I can diversify and spread risk but I 100% believe in the tech and end-game. Onwards and upwards brother!
2720 2018-01-02 20:42:37 When it comes to sharing your thoughts about something-- and the #crypto community is as guilty of this as any other-- there is a difference between evangelizing something and just being a plain old douchebag.
2721 2018-01-02 20:42:36 Well.. listen this now..
Best 2 crypto of 2018 will be...
Litecoin and Verge. Sure.  #hodl

2748 2018-01-02 20:40:29 BTC breaks $15k... And proceed to $17k... Then $20k and pump it $25k

Keep your calm if you are caught in any Alts... BTC will bring more money into crypto ecosystem and pump Global Mcap... $1trillion crypto Global Mcap. is certain before February, 2018. #AGurusPerspective
2749 2018-01-02 20:40:27 Kinda peeved that "crypto" now refers to alt-money instead of 4ec62263fb1a505ab850f5edb8081f6c. :(

2756 2018-01-02 20:40:01 Verge is not a massive team. They're drive by innovation and a clear goal. To bring privacy to the consumers of crypto tech.

If you look at it in that sense. You will know that what you're seeing now is only the beginning of an exciting future. I hope you stick around have faith

2760 2018-01-02 20:39:37 New idea/theory on ICOs.

Going to take a look at the 1 year mark from ICO launch date to see what happens in most cases.

After holding for a year, its long term cap gains, I wouldn't be surprised to find a large dump in most of these cases.

Doing research later.

2761 2018-01-02 20:39:33  4.0 isn't working with TOR. They haven't pushed an update. Even says on their official twitter page they've yet to push an update. On github, no update for tor has been pushed. It doesn't obfuscate IPs. I don't care whether the site is real or not.

2772 2018-01-02 20:39:00 I'm asking, if you're in a coin at 200% profit, you would sell in these situations?
2773 2018-01-02 20:38:53 How did your crypto get stolen? And how are you preventing that from happening moving forward?
2774 2018-01-02 20:38:46 Lmao 
2775 2018-01-02 20:38:44 100 JPY(BTC): 1176.640 ~ 1177.310 KRW(BTC)
2776 2018-01-02 20:38:39 Another hint for people who day trade and may have more assets than me. Here is a tip.  Find a health Crypto 600sat or less that has crazy predictable parabolic swings and HODL your BTC and ETH big in the short term than use that BTC or ETH to pay bills, or Bolster your LongHolds
2777 2018-01-02 20:38:39 Bullish run on #bitcoin started today .. LETS GO! #BTC #crypto

2780 2018-01-02 20:38:34 Amen! I'm not a early cryptonit feb-14 but until 6 months ago people  were laughing at me and my BTC shill and now well lets just say I'm a  bit more popular lol
2781 2018-01-02 20:38:33 How about for crypto? 
2782 2018-01-02 20:38:21 You got this
2783 2018-01-02 20:38:19 Which CRYPTO had a better year. XRP isnt a crypto.

2786 2018-01-02 20:38:07 If only there was a social media platform that had it's own coin, tipping network for users, charts, trading integration and was dedicated towards $crypto.
2787 2018-01-02 20:38:05 don't think so, btc will still grow but slowing down Altcoins will be much slower than before... Altcoins awareness are raising fast among new investors @devnullius

2790 2018-01-02 20:37:56 @OMGSERV Bonsoir, y aurait-il moyen de savoir pourquoi mon vps est verrouillé en raison de minage de crypto-monnaie ?
2791 2018-01-02 20:37:54 Eventually, we're going to see a 10 trillion dollar crypto bubble.

2799 2018-01-02 20:37:34 This is absurd. I'm cashing out to fiat.  I'm DONE w crypto.  -secretly scoops up more alts on the dip- 
2800 2018-01-02 20:37:27 $AKE looking like they could be huge with their new crypto currency mining facility in the state of Washington! Keeping an eye on this one.
2801 2018-01-02 20:37:13 Jo  dith wait for that too happy
2802 2018-01-02 20:37:12 @VentureCoinist was wondering if you could give us your working definition of "liquidity" in the crypto space. feel like its a misunderstood term in the space
2803 2018-01-02 20:37:12 Few problems here.

1. Gimmick? It's the second ever crypto that was meant to improve upon $BTC.
2. Ponzi? You either don't know what a Ponzi scheme is (did you know also that pyramid and Ponzi are different? Likely not...) or are just stupid.
3. Lee holds no $LTC.

Try again.
2804 2018-01-02 20:37:11 carrot bottomed coffee CUP patternt with a handle to drink from indicating price may continue on it's bullish journey
2805 2018-01-02 20:37:09 Seems like it, but how can every alt, dump at exactly the same time? Huh..
Crypto system
2806 2018-01-02 20:37:08 yes
2807 2018-01-02 20:37:07 Additionally, it's still possible to feel alienated within the gay community, especially if you espouse radical politics or enjoy oddities like crypto. I'm single and will remain so for the forseeable future, meaning I miss out on some concrete benefits to partnership.

2811 2018-01-02 20:36:48 Yo he querido comprar Verge y Ripple con USD, pero no se puede, primero hay que comprar bitcoin (Primera comision) y luego comprar las crypto con ese bitocin comprado (Segunda comision). De entrada estoy perdiendo dinero.
2812 2018-01-02 20:36:40 Let me know when that crypto guide comes out 
2813 2018-01-02 20:36:37 I could've done without all the drama, but I believe in the tech and usability of #Verge. Short-term? If you didn't get in weeks ago. Bad. Long-Term? Solid investment.
2814 2018-01-02 20:36:36 yvw sir , truth must be said !
2815 2018-01-02 20:36:34 This shud be done by everyone with a desktop.. i dont have one so cant confirm... can sumone make donations for my comp... its all toasted n i need a new one... #verge #VergeFam $xvg   DN9xqpUf91xPUDZktAtxmhtofAjMo1rrjL
2816 2018-01-02 20:36:31 right... i sold all alts today before the dump
2817 2018-01-02 20:36:28 Noobs can't dump that much that fast.
2818 2018-01-02 20:36:26 Russians need vehicles to pull money, as oppotunities are quite narrow. Crypto market will do. In satellite Belarus local regime has launched crypto offshore already.
2819 2018-01-02 20:36:24 Bearish trend?
2820 2018-01-02 20:36:23 As a TRADER I started to make more money... when I finally started to press the sell button... I hate to be in -position.. and I learned how to skip that.. not 100% succesful.. but even when I miss  some trains.. I remember the rule...There is always another one... #crypto

2834 2018-01-02 20:35:47 What industries do you think will grow the most this year ? A.I.? Crypto? Health?
2835 2018-01-02 20:35:46 Things can only repeat themselves so many times, doesn't matter if its charts or patterns. BTC repeated the same process multiple times. People are getting smarter and buying more alts on the dips. The more money coming into crypto the harder it is getting to herd the sheep.
2836 2018-01-02 20:35:40 DM and ill help you
2837 2018-01-02 20:35:37 Depends if a -10% correction ‘costs’ you aprox 10 BTC worth of alts 
2838 2018-01-02 20:35:35 Rad ! Ok
2839 2018-01-02 20:35:34 Should I consider 2017 as a Good or Bad year?

2846 2018-01-02 20:35:20 Dear helpful lovely guys, do you think it was a good idea to buy #xvg or a mistake?
#xrp
2847 2018-01-02 20:35:16 Hey dude do you recommend to trade in USD or in BTC? Im new in this :) ty
2848 2018-01-02 20:35:15 Do more crypto and blockchain!!!
2849 2018-01-02 20:35:15 People with a lot more capital may be able to swing trade more often but its a risk to some of those just investing small amounts here and there. Not every crypto degen is created equal.
2850 2018-01-02 20:35:08 $XVG is open source software developed & updated by unpaid volunteers, supported by community(there was no premine). Just like #bitcoin, the word about #XVG is spread by it's owners(you). The large scale, high speed network, with #nextgen #privacy is perfect for use as #currency.
2851 2018-01-02 20:35:03 Rumors that also North Korea already acquiring crypto by hacking and hijacking computers to mine.
2852 2018-01-02 20:35:02 @dbrig31 keep it going 
2853 2018-01-02 20:34:54 Check out this dude @Haejin_Crypto he posts very analytical charts and price predictions on most crypto
2854 2018-01-02 20:34:53 1) Works for avowed Bitcoin hater JP Morgan.

2) Is presentable to the mainstream. Featured in mainstream crypto mags like Coindesk.

3) Extremely PC. Virtue signals all day about women in blockchain. 

Yup, @AmberBaldet has all the trappings of Crypto Manchurian Candidate.
2855 2018-01-02 20:34:48 Guess who sold their townhome in the Bay Area, moved to Michigan for the geographic arbitrage, and used a big chunk of the tax-free gains to invest in crypto?

THIS GUY!!!
2856 2018-01-02 20:34:38 its more psychological
if a bilderberg member goes in, one could think the cabal/cartel will not stop it
2857 2018-01-02 20:34:35 I marvel at the #lowtoshi effect: "cheap" $crypto coins attracting buyers/users/communities so powerfully, just by virtue of low price (and those users are often completely ignorant of supply/marketcap).
Gee, I wonder if anyone's been accumulating in the #litoshi markets?
2858 2018-01-02 20:34:19 I am starting a paid group. I have no experience and absolutely nothing meaningful to contribute. I don't understand T/A, and I don't know what $BTC is. WHO'S IN, only $50 per month, cash only!
2859 2018-01-02 20:34:15 I have a 19 y o :D
11 times more money in BTC than cost (incl. maintenance) of my car.

2863 2018-01-02 20:34:05 My main bitches are $ltc $doge and $xrp... I won’t discuss my side hoes
2864 2018-01-02 20:33:46 At this point it just seems criminally arrogant to make that statement, especially with such confidence. Sometimes I wonder if they’re using deliberate disinformation to keep boomers from shopping for new pension managers haha
2865 2018-01-02 20:33:45 bitcoin3000 gab_francesch Imo cryptocurrency protocol markets are much more akin to Top Level Domainname markets - where Zipf's law does not apply. Thought is that lack of geographic boundaries favors winner a take all outcome (dotcom, bitcoin).
2866 2018-01-02 20:33:45 Hey Sam, I've passed on your feedback/suggestion. At this stage I’m not able to confirm an official statement regarding crypto-accounts. ^Alissa
2867 2018-01-02 20:33:44 I wonder how many New year revolutions revolved around making bank in crypto lol
2868 2018-01-02 20:33:38 New to this crypto stuff this past week. But what I have learnt is buy low sell high.. I'm buying in now I can see this project going places compared to all those other coins I researched.
2869 2018-01-02 20:33:38 Yeah I love $NEO & $GAS concept so this was a big pull for me towards $VEN as well as their recent partnership news.
2870 2018-01-02 20:33:34 I have issues in the last 2 weeks, seems like #polonix #Bittrex #CEXio  and some other exchanges are under massive DDoS , and it's making me wonder are those are real "attacks" or its just real people looking for trading Crypto
2871 2018-01-02 20:33:33 AlyssaHertig pwuille eric_lombrozo 2drewlee NicolasDorier 6/ If yes, should he be higher or lower on the list? : #coindesk #crypto $btc $eth $pay $neo $sec $sc
2872 2018-01-02 20:33:26 @tjp2116 who knows with these crypto’s?
2873 2018-01-02 20:33:24 I understand you are worried about your money; but #WraithProtocol 4.0 wasn't built to make you money - there are plenty of ICO ponzi schemes for that. It was built to make it easier for the average person to obfuscate their IP address. In the regard it has NOT let us down.
2874 2018-01-02 20:33:23 #RequestNetwork will probably hit one dollar within this month.
2875 2018-01-02 20:33:17 No realmente. Puedes comprar Ethereum en USD Y comprar otras monedas en Ethereum. También hay exchanges especializados en cambiar crypto por crypto. Yo compré lumens con LTC y BTC con BCH. :)
2876 2018-01-02 20:33:16 The #crypto #community has already changed my life for the better. More opportunities for more people. We can do it!
2877 2018-01-02 20:33:14 Day trader signal: #TRX looks like it's ready for another pump. Sell at the peak, buy at the dip! You guys know what to do

$TRX #Tron #Binance #crypto
2878 2018-01-02 20:33:13 Lmao I’d nominate you or @dbrig31 cause you guys keep me sane when I’m in the red  but i appreciate it brother lol. I’m always here for you guys lol
2879 2018-01-02 20:33:09 People fudding out doesn't really affect newcomers. I'm sure a lot of the TA takes that into consideration, considering the trend has been in a downward trajectory for a few days.
2880 2018-01-02 20:33:09 If you have a $100 you’re not too worried about, I’d really suggest picking up $ECC #ECC. A only .00000009, there’s insane potential to multiply that 100 by 5x very quickly.
2881 2018-01-02 20:33:08 This is true :) and a lot of it comes from mainstream media pumping up how much % increases crypto has had in short time and it leads to unhealthy expectations for people.

Crypto investments are extremely volatile and as easy as you can make the money you can just as easily lose
2882 2018-01-02 20:33:07 so..no fudboi here..just stop the lies..XVG lied to so many people i know..
2883 2018-01-02 20:33:02 Look at the roadmap for info on GitHub.  I believe they mentioned it there.
2884 2018-01-02 20:32:58 Fully agree
2885 2018-01-02 20:32:57 あの上げ方はそうなりますよねwww
2886 2018-01-02 20:32:50 It's all about the balance. Excluding baby pics. You shouldn't post it. Never. 
Crypto shouldn't be the goal itself, just as money shouldn't.
2887 2018-01-02 20:32:42 me too
2888 2018-01-02 20:32:40 Oh people are going after OG crypto traders? Yup alt season must be over
2889 2018-01-02 20:32:26 first off you buy bitcoin on a wallet exchange such as coinbase/blockchain wallet. Then you transfer that too a crypto exchange and on there, you can exchange that to many different crypto's depending on which site you're on
2890 2018-01-02 20:32:22 First recommendation is for XVG. Great secure coin with one of a kind dev team just lacking a PR. Underwalued coin. Real price is around 1$ which will be reached this year. #XVG #Wraith protocol
2891 2018-01-02 20:32:02 Not mine.
2892 2018-01-02 20:31:47 Hey please could you give us you email to see if we received it

2900 2018-01-02 20:30:31 Will soon flow out of stocks and into crypto.

2902 2018-01-02 20:30:26 Are there a LOT of men in crypto? 
Yes
Did that stop me from learning more? 
No.
Bitcoin treats you the same any gender, race, religion, income, or politics.
You can buy a little or a lot. The most impt thing is to hop in if it speaks to you.

2904 2018-01-02 20:30:10 Noobs are selling alts on the dip to buy the bitcoin tip then bitcoin dumps and they call crypto a scam
2905 2018-01-02 20:30:10 I swear to god, I step away from crypto twitter for like a few hours and bam everyone is talking about something I know NOTHING ABOUT!
2906 2018-01-02 20:30:07 #Crypto world - disclosure is everything.  Anonymising funds (#Monero) considered evidence of high risk activity. @coindesk #invest #fintech #investment #DigitalIdentity #bitcoin #corpgov
2907 2018-01-02 20:30:03 #bitcoin moving to new ath  $22k mark..
2908 2018-01-02 20:30:03 Don't make money moves based on the cost of your investment, make them based on the return. 1K of Bitcoin a while back doesn't sound so expensive if you knew you'd get an 18K return.
2909 2018-01-02 20:30:02 Investing in crypto currency has a waaay better ROI than beer and drinks
2910 2018-01-02 20:30:00 same same :)
2911 2018-01-02 20:29:51 Yeah that was me :)p
2912 2018-01-02 20:29:48 Great decision. THOR power is one of the many great things we can look forward to. Most undervalued crypto right now

2924 2018-01-02 20:28:52 I agree. There has been so much unfounded hate on this coin/project; it blows my mind. Every time one piece of FUD is proven false, the group of fudders just move onto some other aspect to hate on. It's dumb. It's a solid project.

2926 2018-01-02 20:28:48 Man, I think a lot of people come into crypto thinking they will be the next "Scarface" or "Tony Montana".. It's funny....People can make good money, but they have to be patient..... This isn't the stock market....
2927 2018-01-02 20:28:48 Despite minor loses I'm happy to see it grow. BTC growth is cause for further attraction outside the market. Which means LT growth for ALTs through the trickle down, provides new discount for traders, and corrects levels of mooning coins while leaving them at higher lows. All gd
2928 2018-01-02 20:28:37 I am mad because @YobitExchange screwed me on Espers because they didn't take the old chain down when I started my crypto journey dumb and naive..

2933 2018-01-02 20:28:08 Literally the most reactive market I've ever seen.....BTC pumps and everyone panic sells their alts. Every single time. If you can't stomach market fluctuations, trading is not for you. Buy and hold. $BTC $crypto

2959 2018-01-02 20:26:42 Any recommendations where u can store Trx ? Please
2960 2018-01-02 20:26:28 I believe it will continue to see some resistance for the next 12 to 24 hours and a small dip as people are moving more towards COLX once again. Then ECA should continue to rise again.

After YEARS of being in crypto, I can finally say that without a doubt, I was right.

The years of learning have prepared me.
2964 2018-01-02 20:26:22 People who dump $alts for $btc in a ultra-short term are dumb asses. #HODL is the key.  #crypto #cryptocurrency
2965 2018-01-02 20:26:18 So when the company stocks crash due to a bitcoin self, will they announce at that time they are getting out of crypto/blockchain.   Getting ridiculous with these announcements
2966 2018-01-02 20:26:14 Alts are dumping.

2971 2018-01-02 20:25:39 Tu étais prêt à investir des milliers d'euro pour quelques bitcoins ? Les seuls gagnants du bitcoin sont ceux qui les ont acquis quand il ne valait pas grand ou peu de choses. Maintenant il y a pas mal de crypto-currency prometteuse, mais faut être patient. Buy low, sell high !
2972 2018-01-02 20:25:39 Got my @21Cryptos Jan edition. Let’s learn some shit  #crypto #btc
2973 2018-01-02 20:25:37 Damn the loss of BTC went back into altcoins(proving day trading in crypto has increased a minimum of 10% since futures. BTC is back up to 15200+USD, Yet most altcoins aren't down 12%(like BTC is up 12%+).  This looks like this may be the situation through 2018. ME LIKEY! ROFL!
2974 2018-01-02 20:25:35 Are you blind or stupid? Can you not see BTC bullrun?
2975 2018-01-02 20:25:35 Buy BTC on Coinbase>send to binance>buy TRX
2976 2018-01-02 20:25:31 Le prix du bitcoin dépasse les 15 000$. Fin des vacances..

2979 2018-01-02 20:25:07 It is important to consider: “Would I rather hold at least SOME of this value in $BTC at this point?” Unless you are very skilled, swinging everything back and forth between #Alts and $BTC is dangerous. But it’s reasonable to make some effort to increase $BTC holdings.
2980 2018-01-02 20:25:06 Might have started.
2981 2018-01-02 20:24:59 Everyone asking me to help via twitter so here we go. #crypto #Ethereum #bitcoin #trading
2982 2018-01-02 20:24:59 Hope your right! 
2983 2018-01-02 20:24:56 so for us "B" squad of cryptoGrinders, what about now?    Did you sell your $QTUM in anticipation also?  Glad you're over your flu Ryan.....look forward to hearing/reading your perspectives.
2984 2018-01-02 20:24:52 How faster how better mate!
2985 2018-01-02 20:24:52 Still holding the others.

If you are looking to buy and hold a crypto for minimum 10000 percent gain(1 to 3 months hold). You can put in a very very small amount into CTIC3, this can be bought on the cryptopia exchange using BTC. GL
2986 2018-01-02 20:24:47 It might... but it's way too risky for me to buy at these levels... I prefer to get in before the pump has happened.
2987 2018-01-02 20:24:37 You would have to sell to a major crypto that supports usd. BTC and ETH usually
2988 2018-01-02 20:24:36 Ethereum is looking super solid! Growing at a great steady pace and only falling short ever so often. I went all in on bitcoin recently & i’m happy about it. But i definitely agree with you, with this year and everything changing, crypto will only go up & get pricey.
2989 2018-01-02 20:24:28 RobertRowlinson _Crypto_papa is he running paid group?
2990 2018-01-02 20:24:28 v3ktorious $trx is good $LEND is better
2991 2018-01-02 20:24:27 alekskishkin HODL. it will rebound
2992 2018-01-02 20:24:21 I thought BTC wallets can send to BCH wallets
2993 2018-01-02 20:24:17 They are into a different cryptocurrency because it hides all traces of who owns the coin and where the money actually came from to purchase the value of coin.

It has no bearing on the US dollar. Crypt currency gets it value from people buying the crypto currency with Euros.
2994 2018-01-02 20:24:17 what are the chances for #ECA to be listed on cryptopia ?
2995 2018-01-02 20:24:12 Ego
2996 2018-01-02 20:23:53 Give it a week. Nothing in the crypto world stays down Forever. I've been following this guy (Haejin Lee) He NEVER misses on a prediction.
2997 2018-01-02 20:23:47 And people think crypto is risky. Pretty easy to forget how much control fiat money banks have over us too...
2998 2018-01-02 20:23:44 Define "crypto tattoo". Can the community vote on it? "Zetacoin to Africa".
2999 2018-01-02 20:23:43 Everyone’s doing goals for 2018 so here’s mine :

10k Followers on Twitter
Top 200 Finish on Clash Royale
Top 3 in a ROS Event
Accumulate a wealthy sum of Crypto
Fly out again and meet more people from the Clash community

Hope everyone has a great year

3019 2018-01-02 20:22:27 XRP rocks. It outperformed ALL cryptos in 2017 by mile (37000% gains). Been in dev since before bitcoin, and is expanding its reach into platform and normal currency usage this year (not just banking sector). Faster and cheaper... a monster for sure.

3032 2018-01-02 20:21:50 I think there is whale who agrees with you. They have thrown up an epic sell wall multiple times, which has helped tank the price. I'm hoping that they are doing this to get a better entry price for themselves, then they will strap in for take off.

3044 2018-01-02 20:20:57 Yo creo que hay que seguir el día a día de las Crypto, tanto las noticias positivas y negativas. Personalmente creo que hay futuro, hoy por lo menos vi que tuvo una caída del 30% lo que confirma su volatilidad. No estaría mal invertir en ella si se tiene la posibilidad.
3045 2018-01-02 20:20:54 Crypto made me better.
3046 2018-01-02 20:20:43 Allready a working project, will now be on the blockchain.
3047 2018-01-02 20:20:39 blah blah blah blah, more crypto bullshit. The problem with the entire alt community , is that it's like a sewing circle of bickering middle aged women. The truth is, that when REAL money eventually hits crypto, 10-20 T , 95% of all coins will disappear as the shit is dissolved.
3048 2018-01-02 20:20:37 not looking too good at the moment my friend. I hope this isn't the exit scam.
3049 2018-01-02 20:20:35 The world of crypto: when $BTC #Bitcoin rallies a "measly" +$600 USD, everyone panics & rushes to sell their altcoins. Human nature: utterly predictable & repeated. BUY THE DIP!
3050 2018-01-02 20:20:35 The cycle. Old crypto players sell out of alts to jump on $BTC breakout. As $BTC continues to run more alts are dumped.  New crypto players that stay are left holding bloody bags. Then old crypto sweeps in with high btc value and buys bloody alts. Thoughts?
3051 2018-01-02 20:20:30 Then I wouldn’t worry about it yet. The $crypto cycle could be described as two rock climbers tethered to each other, one being $BTC and the other #alts. When one gets high enough the other guy starts to catch up. Back and forth.
3052 2018-01-02 20:20:17 He's a great Technical Analyst but check out my tweet history. When Haejin's TA said it's gonna break ATH after the dip to 1500 from 1900 levels, I said it's gonna crash down to 800. Yes, it did. You can't base your trade only depending on TA. DYOR - TA, FA & use lessons learned.

3064 2018-01-02 20:19:29 Margin calls on #crypto derivatives look interesting. Wherever Fiat meets #crypto , and vice versa, danger lurks. Watch for mis-matches on delivery timing, and other standards. Even little delays mount up fast.
3065 2018-01-02 20:19:24 Would you ruin a great position for a 10-15% dip?
3066 2018-01-02 20:19:14 try this crypto instead. it already works much better.

3069 2018-01-02 20:18:59 Chris Larsen is now wealthier than Elon Musk. Crypto has turned any semblance of a merit based societal incentive system on it's head.

3074 2018-01-02 20:18:49 @VentureCoinist a good person to follow for some technical analysis and wholesome insight on crypto. Good up the good work .
3075 2018-01-02 20:18:48 So if average wings/food and not so skimpy outfits can’t draw in customers we’ll try crypto-currency rewards. Personally, I’d have thought substituting tv’s for group gaming sessions and blonde bimbos for competent servers would be the plan.
3076 2018-01-02 20:18:42 I feel like I should just not look at my alts this week lol

3087 2018-01-02 20:18:04 Invest that money into crypto currencies and thank me later 

3088 2018-01-02 20:17:55 Quality. My '03 vw golf diesel does me just fine too.
3089 2018-01-02 20:17:51 Getting in/out of trades infinitely increases your risk as opposed to making one buy and holding.  Don’t act like trading is managing risk it’s inheriting additional risk
3090 2018-01-02 20:17:51 Customize your Strategy to whatever works best for you. If you want long term growth without much oversight then large caps can't hurt, if you want more short term speculative, than small caps are better

3093 2018-01-02 20:17:46 Gotta love the vol in crypto markets (since there isn't any anywhere else rn)! BTC up more in the past 4 hours than the **ANNUAL** nominal return target for basically every pension fund in the US (11%ish vs. 7%ish).
3094 2018-01-02 20:17:41 No, it's not. I primarily identify as male, white, American, relatively privileged, and politically radical. Though this describes 90% of crypto rn. But being gay does me to perceive things from a different lens. And I wear it on my sleeve sometimes...
3095 2018-01-02 20:17:38 I'm buying the dip now. Need to get more $LEND at this rate
3096 2018-01-02 20:17:38 $BTC could not damage $MINT :)
3097 2018-01-02 20:17:37 Btc fucked it
3098 2018-01-02 20:17:35 So it's a risky but potentially lucrative move, and based on your particular entries and willingness to take risk right?
3099 2018-01-02 20:17:31 Always keep some BTC in the portfolio for that reason
3100 2018-01-02 20:17:29 Amen brother.
3101 2018-01-02 20:17:26 @NicolasMaduro Sabe ya cuando emitirán la crypto divisa Petrocoin y dónde en que mercado? El mundo quiere romper el bloqueo americano y esta es una excelente forma. En los blogs de cryptodivisas hay mucha expectación (aceptación). El mundo está a la espera señor maduro.

3105 2018-01-02 20:17:10 Agree. Neo is a vastly superior tech to ETH. Faaar faster tx, more secure, supports multiple mainstream programming languages, and is the primary government compliant platform for the largest population on the planet while still being focused on global adoption.
3106 2018-01-02 20:17:08 I didn’t set up yet but it says if you lose your password you can never lose your wallet. Is that true ? Lost forever ? That’s crazy lol
3107 2018-01-02 20:17:06 Lol so ballsy, I would have waited until all bugs are out
3108 2018-01-02 20:17:01 Lmao
3109 2018-01-02 20:16:53 You realize loans are a strictly regulated sphere and take time to get right, ESPECIALLY in crypto backed collateral. SALT team is doing great, $300M+ pending, couldn't ask for more.
3110 2018-01-02 20:16:52 I think of a lot of new investors to Crypto need to learn to stop checking prices so often. It's hard finding a coin that hasn't increased in price from a month ago. People getting rich Hold good coins and sell for massive profit. People losing money day trade and chase hype.
3111 2018-01-02 20:16:46 That's another way to look at it. However, this behaviour is highly unlikely considering the crypto market is mostly filled with FOMO. That will more likely lead to irrational/emotional/panic  trading. What do you say ?
3112 2018-01-02 20:16:45 If you're not on the crypto bus by now you're probably running behind it! There's still time to hop on. Don't look up at the #BTC sky, there is plenty of low-level diamonds on the ground like #Lisk and #TRX Tron. #altcoins #cryptocurrency #future #blockchain
3113 2018-01-02 20:16:39 Well don't be proud at all with your school time, if this is your argument! Actually, you failed Big Time!
3114 2018-01-02 20:16:37 Do I need to have the desktop wallet for this supposed Hard Fork ?
3115 2018-01-02 20:16:36 don't think they're freaking out bout corrections but scared when they see how bullish $btc acts currently :D
3116 2018-01-02 20:16:36 What's fct?
3117 2018-01-02 20:16:35 Its me or there are FOMO in #btc ? Its pump, but #altcoins are dumping... i love u  #Crypto but sometimes i dont understand the way you move...
3118 2018-01-02 20:16:27  I mean no one wants to see zero but we live in a world of crypto rule #1 never invest an amount you can't live with hitting zero honestly I have a large chunk in it but I believe in the project and it will eventually grow "hopefully"
3119 2018-01-02 20:16:25 Good entries are never rekt unless you completely fuck up and exit at a loss to chase a BTC pump. You didn't do that, did u
3120 2018-01-02 20:16:24 $TSPG another vague PR entering the blockchain and crypto hot commodity market, is we dont know yet what were doing but itll be in that market. Notice many of these that say coming days still havent told us wtf theyre doing
3121 2018-01-02 20:16:23 You ain't seen nothin yet
3122 2018-01-02 20:16:09 @Socal_crypto what makes more sense in terms of portfolio building: pick 10-20 from the top market cap, or do a mix with small cap ones? I know not investment advice :) I just want a personal opinion. Thanks so much!
3123 2018-01-02 20:16:03 This is super optimistic for a market run on emotion IMO

Reason why 95% of traders lose is because of emotion and this is across all the markets ie; forex, penny stocks

Smaller entry barrier to trade crypto makes the emotions in the market stronger imo
3124 2018-01-02 20:15:56 actually they all picked Crypto so I think they are doing ok.
3125 2018-01-02 20:15:54 and that is sad but you cannot invest what you cannot afford to loose. I bet you agree to that. Tech like Wraith is different and needs to be polished. But the constant barrage of assault on the coin and the dev does not help crypto market.
3126 2018-01-02 20:15:51 a shout out to all the crypto fam out there on twitter for passing 600 followers. We're all in this together and that's the only way we can all move forward. Thank you!
3127 2018-01-02 20:15:50 I was a mechanic for 10 years, it's a lot cheaper to own a beater lol
3128 2018-01-02 20:15:49 Waiting gor my 1k xvg
3129 2018-01-02 20:15:48 Because we picked crypto.
3130 2018-01-02 20:15:47 I was thinking the other day that I could drive my car another 5 years, easy.
3131 2018-01-02 20:15:47 @Master Haejin you are right on top of Bitcoin. I am new and would like to buy other cryptocurrencies that you analyze. Where can I open an account to buy Verge, Civic, Redcoin, etc...? Thank you so much for your hard work on all our behalf._Crypto
3132 2018-01-02 20:15:39 my thoughts exactly
3133 2018-01-02 20:15:34 Agreed, I think a lot of people expected instant $$$$ that's not the game works and #XVG has a TON of potential and it will be some time before people realize how revolutionary for a crypto it is...... Hey, I'm happy - I'm investing in the idea - not to make a quick buck.
3134 2018-01-02 20:15:32 Focus on @LinkedIn in 2018! Create content, build a community (invest) now and get disproportionate returns (profits.) Forget crypto - too volatile.
3135 2018-01-02 20:15:21 50 year old truck driver I have met twice and never talked crypto with was shilling shitcoins to me at work. What a time to be alive.
3136 2018-01-02 20:15:20 How has Kanye West not come out with his own Crypto Currency yet?
3137 2018-01-02 20:15:19 Yall freaking out with 5 ~ 15% corrections? Welp.
3138 2018-01-02 20:15:15 January 2017 total crypto market cap was 17 billion USD. Since then it’s grown 3500% with well over 600 billion market cap. That’s just insanity

3147 2018-01-02 20:14:39 So you predict it will come back around 14k before the next bullrun?
3148 2018-01-02 20:14:31 NO ONE CARES: CRYPTO
3149 2018-01-02 20:14:26 The dev team has already admitted already that Tor hasn't been fully integrated into 4.0 yet. It's in the code but not an active part yet. So that site is likely gathering genuine IPs from transactions. Hell they even say on their twitter that they need to push an update for it.
3150 2018-01-02 20:14:14 I desperately want women to enter crypto so I can dump my bags on them.

3152 2018-01-02 20:14:07 Seems like “I’m getting into crypto” was the New Year 2018 resolution. BTC is having a good day. Alts are flying and many are outpacing BTC today.  Wonderful to see 2018 starting on a good note.

3160 2018-01-02 20:13:46 It's funny how crypto companies make announcements that they will be making an announcement soon.
3161 2018-01-02 20:13:44 I don't think so - even after announcing allocation to individual investors there still is manual countersigning , crypto -> USD price conversion and payment.  To account for purchaser delays and such they'll want this stuff out there as soon as possible

#tzero $OSTK
3162 2018-01-02 20:13:43 I have no issues with the deadline being missed, or if the product wasn't as solid as expected. Honesty and transparency goes a long way, and telling us it'll be delayed due to so and so, for so and so reason would've alleviated the mass FUD, and increase investor's confidence.

3218 2018-01-02 20:09:42 ETH just got rekt by that BTC move as well
3219 2018-01-02 20:09:38 We call that an “entry point” for those who missed out lol
3220 2018-01-02 20:09:35 really they should all drop only 10% if bitcoin goes up 10%. but altcoin market seems to overreact each time. if btc starts going up again, altcoins might be choppy trading for a while.

3224 2018-01-02 20:09:19 Let's not forget that almost 10 years ago the average taxpayer helped bail out global banks. Today banks want to control how you spend your own money. Aussie banks in particular causing headaches for legitimate crypto exchanges like @coinspotau #auspol

3236 2018-01-02 20:08:36 Selling your #altcoins when $BTC starts to pump will be a very dangerous game moving forward in #crypto. As BTC loses dominance, you will be throwing away more value in your alts. If you still want to sell, I will be one of the people buying your coins at a discount!

3250 2018-01-02 20:07:31 Am surprised, some so called old dogs think that crypto revolves around twitter.
3251 2018-01-02 20:07:30 don't believe this the coin is only going down not up anymore....

3255 2018-01-02 20:07:16 I'm not because I'm not partaking. That's illegal and very immoral. I'm holding and I've capped my investment into crypto for now. I think the blatant market manipulation in #CryptoCurrencies is disgusting. It's happening everywhere and it's not what this is supposed to be about.

3262 2018-01-02 20:06:39 Great day for crypto. 2018 is off to a great start! Nearly everything is up. BTW, if you're looking at /BTC trading pairs and the charts show the coin going down, that's only b/c BTC is on the rise and the ratios are correcting. Look at a /USD pair to see the current value.

3312 2018-01-02 20:03:05 You guys write one day how crypto is dead then the next day you write how it’s going to take off, clearly Forbes has gone down hill in their content
3313 2018-01-02 20:03:05 Cryptocurrency isn't a web application! Crypto infrastructure is programmed for months, then a domain selected when nearing public launch. Even selecting the name of the coin isn't essential to core technology development!

3315 2018-01-02 20:02:55 Hahaha  you had a feeling a $BTC pump was about to happen. 
3316 2018-01-02 20:02:55 Approach every person in life as someone you can learn from. No matter who you meet.
3317 2018-01-02 20:02:54 Stay HUMBLE. Hoping to abide by this rule my entire life.
3318 2018-01-02 20:02:49 Congrats on the big day. Another benefit of buying crypto: Cardio without moving a muscle :-)
3319 2018-01-02 20:02:48 If an SEC inv. adviser manages client assets that are not "funds" or "securities" the adviser doesn’t have to maintain these assets with a qualified custodian. This raises the question whether crypto assets that are not “securities” need to be held with a qualified custodian.

3332 2018-01-02 20:02:05 Especially like $BLK & $SYS. Valuation way below the appreciation of similar featured coins that are at least 4x higher at this point. If there is a “value asset” class in #crypto these 2 have to be at the top of the list...
3333 2018-01-02 20:02:03 Nice opportunity to take that leftover BTC and buy alts tbqhf

3342 2018-01-02 20:01:44 A tip for holders. If you are not a short trader, and don’t have the money to buy more during dips. Don’t look at the price. Price can go up and down with 10%/30% easily. It’s crypto. Whales make use of your weakness - @TheVergeLion #VergeFam $XVG #Verge #XVG #Vergecurrency

3361 2018-01-02 20:00:51 @brian_armstrong is everything alright with coinbase? Tough time figuring out if transaction went thru, between crypto wallets and usd wallet.
3362 2018-01-02 20:00:51 What people don’t realize is when a stock or crypto moves it doesn’t mean it was a smart investment, it just means the average person thought it was

3364 2018-01-02 20:00:49 #bulltrap #bitcoin $btcusd #whoknew  This is real buying and profit taking. pump and dump is a form of daily activities in crypto where anyone with money can compete
3365 2018-01-02 20:00:39 Buying while noobs panic dump is almost unfair, like playing crypto on cheat mode.

3374 2018-01-02 20:00:04 I was more stressing the clearing, settlement, and margin risks of #crypto . The old world has settlement systems that are quite predictable, #crypto has choke points, like exchanges, that are almost free of capital and regulation. There are risks at the cusp, as ever.

3503 2018-01-02 19:51:56 How can that work in relation to your other charts for alt coins? You have said everything is going ridiculously up  but aren’t they somewhat relative to bitcoin?
3504 2018-01-02 19:51:55 The King of the jungle is back. Can you hear tiger is roaring loud.Bitcoin is striking back hard.Where are the hatters ? Can't see you. # Crypto world .
3505 2018-01-02 19:51:52 They actually do. It's to keep the #FUD out xD
3506 2018-01-02 19:51:50 I knew I liked you!
3507 2018-01-02 19:51:43 $BTC I'm going to start a company called "Blockchain Blockchain Blockchain Blockchain Ltd." so it can go up 1,000% in a few days $OSTK $BTCUSD #blockchain #bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #cryptocurrency #crypto
3508 2018-01-02 19:51:41 Interest is not the right word, it's actually a stake. You get a tiny portion of each transaction as a stakeholder, similar to how mining crypto rewards you for verifying transactions
3509 2018-01-02 19:51:37 Wow you calling it undervalued trying to pump it so you can sell out yourself .... the coin is a failure and anyone who buys it will regret it massively
3510 2018-01-02 19:51:34 TRON is top 20 by market cap without being on big exchanges (#Bittrex, #Bitfinex, etc.) Think of price when it IS listed - early 2018! #TRX #TRON $TRX #CRYPTO #HODL 
3511 2018-01-02 19:51:32 Shoutout to the big everything spike, seriously everybody just go out and buy as much of any crypto as you can don't question shit just empty your bank account
3512 2018-01-02 19:51:31 I hope you reach your goal! RT’d and Followed 
3513 2018-01-02 19:51:24 Cant, No more btc left :(

3523 2018-01-02 19:50:42 So excited about the prospects of $TRX. Don't get trapped into the day trading. HODL for a real big win! Swings will happen, play for the endgame. #Justthestart. $Crypto $Alts $Tronix

3531 2018-01-02 19:50:07 my clown of a brother:

“why don’t bloods invest in bitcoin?....it’s a crypto currency”
3532 2018-01-02 19:49:59 Its a coin associated with weed, 4/20 ~ 420 is a number associated with weed, google it.
3533 2018-01-02 19:49:58 Crypto currencies are predictable...

Best finance advice I can give anyone is to buy it casually with small monthly investments for as cheap as possible chill during November sell during December and repeat.

That is the safest way to make money with crypto.
3534 2018-01-02 19:49:53 Crypto!

きっかけはそうかもしれないけど、単純にBTCが重要なトレンドライン上抜けしてアルト一斉退避でさらにBTC上に走ったんだと思うんだけども。
3547 2018-01-02 19:49:10 This is very stupid and ignorant, Egypt has no influence on Islam anymore. And anyone connect any religion to crypto is a savage stupid person.
3548 2018-01-02 19:49:08 Newbie here. It seems all major exchanges have a barrier for entry. Either not allowing new accounts or verification taking forever. Besides Binance, can anyone recommend a solid exchange I can start using?
3549 2018-01-02 19:49:07 Patience
3550 2018-01-02 19:49:04 I think btc need to break at least 17k to make a real difference in the alt season. Beside news $XCP is almost at bottom, 4w chart shows that a significant move should come soon.

3558 2018-01-02 19:48:12 Almost everything did with the sudden rise of BTC from $13,500 to $15,000. I LITERALLY bought a huge bag of LBC 3 minutes before the dump. It will be back, especially with the website launch on January 20th just ahead.
3559 2018-01-02 19:48:10 Nice! I just put mine in the wallet last night now have to wait 7 days to start staking

3568 2018-01-02 19:47:26 As BTC moves, alts are dumping. I have buy orders sitting there but they wont hit yet. I may buy alts whtever price when BTC goes to 18k. Nothing for now.
3569 2018-01-02 19:47:24 both good projects. i think long-term salt will do just fine

3580 2018-01-02 19:46:57 PART 1/2 I was searching the past few days for a coin thats not in the top 50, but will be in the top 20. My criteria was based on FA: Good public adoption. Active involvment on Github. Heatlhy traffic on slack.  Good exposure (via socialmedia) #crypto #altcoins #cryptocurrency
3581 2018-01-02 19:46:57 Any coin with a low circulating supply and a major event happening will entice the whales.  Its part of the business, scared money makes no money in crypto

3600 2018-01-02 19:45:15 Link doesn't work for me(?). I'm guessing it's about Ripple and similar? The debate about an authority-backed crypto is going to be big for a few months!

If you check my tweets, I dont disrespect any other trader who posts charts. Only this horse shit

3606 2018-01-02 19:44:50 I think you and @CryptosQueen need to have a Cage Match! I’m sure #Cryptoheads would pay to see that!
3607 2018-01-02 19:44:47 On Twitter I see a lot of people are still waiting for an official announcement from @vergcurrency that Wraith is done/released. This might be something to consider. As well as an official word that Wraith does in fact hides op addresses.
3608 2018-01-02 19:44:46 Maybe its not the investors dumping during $btc bull runs but bots of the crypto exchanges....to profit over their investors and to not miss the $btc profits $btc #cryptoexchange #trading. $altcoins $ltc $dash $eos $trst
3609 2018-01-02 19:44:43 Don't chase the highs!

3611 2018-01-02 19:44:38 what is up with you?

i just asked if you have a source and a proof or if you are one of the much ppl that try to push the price up?
I didn´t blame you i just asked because there are so much ppl that try that.
3612 2018-01-02 19:44:33 And last but not least the CEO is not jumping on the crypto bandwagon the way the likes of $RIOT or that Long Island Tea POS have. This has been awhile in the making. To paraphrase Malcolm X, Bitcoin landed on Patrick; he didn't land on bitcoin. $OSTK

3615 2018-01-02 19:44:18 Saw that. Hopefully it’s a quick recovery. Literally 1 week of progress lost in 20 min
3616 2018-01-02 19:44:16 I’m taking the next 2 days to learn more about it. I like the concept but the idea of wiring money to a Nigerian Crypto platform is one that makes me pause

3632 2018-01-02 19:42:49 He's a day trader, so he might exit and then jump back in 30 minutes later. Long term holders don't look at prices like this we just hodl.
3633 2018-01-02 19:42:46 For all the public scrutiny it might be 15 fruit cakes, an entire cake counter full of them. None of the rest got any interest at all. Could all be crypto-fascists or worse, Corbynites.

3638 2018-01-02 19:42:24 FOR DAYTRADERS - when $BTC #bitcoin is bulling like this, u want to get out of alts as fast as u can even if u have to take a loss. if u don't, u will be holding bags and that means you do not have capital to profit with which is loss time

3752 2018-01-02 19:35:50 I'm done with Kraken. Orders can't be processed bullsh!t.  Worst crypto platform ever. I'm losing today not because of bad trades, it's because the platform sucks every time some big steps are happening. #krakenfx #btc $btc

3761 2018-01-02 19:35:14 Damn it's an immediate 20% retracement of the BTC gains like the end of December, which won't last.  BTC will continue to grow just much slower and smaller bursts than it used too. Makes sense. A lot of people/money was added to crypto when futures opened.

3787 2018-01-02 19:33:35 yea over 1B for sure. No idea where it lands at that point. Will depend on the @dragonchaingang platform efficiencies and adoption from ICOs and enterprises.
3788 2018-01-02 19:33:21 Looks like you sold all your xrp's! Poor you! Don't panic you have time to buy - another 24 hours!
3789 2018-01-02 19:33:13 bitcoin is a boner killer right now.
3790 2018-01-02 19:33:08 That response makes no sense as there will always be available $Ark on open markets as well as new Ark being forged every day to the tune of 21 thousand or more. Also, the list clearly says. "Top 10 with most potential in 2018." What it doesn't say is, "Top 10 that you own."
3791 2018-01-02 19:33:05 Same shit

3793 2018-01-02 19:32:46 If you sell for the $btc ride you will lose. You will cry and you will say the world sucks. After that’s done continue to redownload blockfolio and start the long road to freedom again. Fasten your seatbelts. The world of crypto is for those who have BIG BALLS.
3794 2018-01-02 19:32:46 I always say not to sell in panic.. just hold! Don't try to sell high and buy low if you've ever been caught in the storm  $XLM #Stellar #IBM

3827 2018-01-02 19:30:35 Pro tip. Delete blockfolio and continue as if you never bought crypto while $btc shits on the $alt world. When the king is done kindly redownload blockfolio and commence your daily activities 
3828 2018-01-02 19:30:34 2018 crypto thesis: The smartest devs know the technology needs to hold up to the expectations from 2017 and will work even harder on major improvements throughout the year. People that are bearish on the main cryptoassets will suffer as a result.

3840 2018-01-02 19:29:37 I'm slightly clairvoyant so here's a random non $crypto prediction for 2018.

Computer mouses will stop being the best way to indicate X-Y positioning of cursors on display systems.

Die Altcoin-Spekulation ist nur ein Maß für die Verdummung der Gesellschaft.

3853 2018-01-02 19:29:02 @haydentiff my question is, as a newer crypto investor, how did you determine @Ripple was a good choice to put money in back when their value was merely pennies and how did you find out about them? #XRP #xrpthestandard

3858 2018-01-02 19:28:45 Seeing as AXA is the largest investment contributer to Blockstream, I'd say BTC has more in common with Lehman Brothers than BCC/BCH.
3859 2018-01-02 19:28:36 Some of these are peddling private groups. If they were that good, they would just heed their own advice instead of charging.1 btc a month

3955 2018-01-02 19:22:53 I've had fraud on my @Visa and @MastercardNews debit a few times of the last few months via @eBay and @AskPayPal.  This will ruin your day and piss anyone the F off.

Crypto?  NEVER ever once.

Who runs the scam now MFers?  Fiat is safe...and secure?  PPPPPFFFT!
3956 2018-01-02 19:22:52 I know yall love crypto but truth be told. I know yall love weed much more than anything. Why dont you invest in mary?
3957 2018-01-02 19:22:49 Prediction of the day: Medium to large crypto drop incoming within 2 - 3 days.
3958 2018-01-02 19:22:48 Agree with that
3959 2018-01-02 19:22:21 What price do you think #XRP can reach end of 2018? Thanks for replying!
#Ripple #cryptocurrency #crypto
3960 2018-01-02 19:22:19 BTC_ETH price DECREASED to $0.054277 on #poloniex. New alerts (+/- 4.000 pct) set at: UP: $0.056448 - DOWN: $0.052106 $eth #eth #ethereum #crypto $crypto $btc
3961 2018-01-02 19:22:18 I see only evidence of idiot which try to make from basic address the stealth address and even cant understand that checkbox stays unchecked whyle you try save it few times ))) you're just like monkey with new toy...
3962 2018-01-02 19:22:18 Naming @BittrexExchange as anything ”best” just feels wrong. It’s one of the worst exchanges by far.
3963 2018-01-02 19:22:17 one more thing. they have 4 events in this month so i predict big pump. Anyway for me this is long term coin 
3964 2018-01-02 19:22:15 Hat sich jemand schonmal die iPhone-App-Hotelzimmerschlüssel von @hotelbirdde angeschaut? So vong #security her? Welcher Crypto-Standard?
3965 2018-01-02 19:22:08 Yet the #Masternodes don’t move and are actually still on the up 
3966 2018-01-02 19:22:08 Obvious statement is obvious: The first few existing major companies to embrace crypto will send both of them into TurboRocketOverdrive to the next solar system.

Bets on what crypto/company combination it will be?
3967 2018-01-02 19:22:07 Good sir.
3968 2018-01-02 19:22:04 I cannot be the only one who sees it as “crypto - trouble”

3973 2018-01-02 19:21:53 Since I started out this whole crypto thing, I never, I repeat - never sold off any of my $ALTS for a pumping $BTC.

Sometimes it was scary as hell, especially when seeing other people doing the opposite. 

But on the long run the 'don't panic strategy' works out best for me.
3974 2018-01-02 19:21:50 yes, my reason is to help others in #crypto, this gives me extreme joy and a purpose to my life.
I do great financially myself. I don't need to trick people in paying me for a promise that can't be fullfilled.

3983 2018-01-02 19:21:13 Bitcoin broke 15k. Still going strong.
3984 2018-01-02 19:21:11 Okay thanks for your info. Well, so let's see if they integrate it and when. I'm pretty sure it will be coming in a day with updated release.
3985 2018-01-02 19:21:10 I will do this...some day...when I have FIAT...99.99% of my capital is in crypto right now 
3986 2018-01-02 19:21:04 Ah I see, captain of your own ship. Good way to look at things.

3994 2018-01-02 19:20:23 Not going to log over to my Crypto account for this but i will say it.......... The market is correcting now with the NA base, so you better buy within the next 8 hrs in the dip if you want to make max profit. Stack as much #TRX #TRONCOIN  as you can!!!

3999 2018-01-02 19:20:10 Good buy. If @Haejin_Crypto believes this MAY be the dip, he's not God, but he's one hell of an analyst, so I'll take the risk and bank on #XVG's exciting #WraithProtocol. XVG seems to be a pretty polarizing coin, but I took a risk on them and I'm glad.

4013 2018-01-02 19:19:27 The current system is better at tracking transactions than crypto-currencies. It is very easy to make anonymous transactions via crypto-currencies and thus they have been popular for anything illegal.

4017 2018-01-02 19:19:23 
4018 2018-01-02 19:19:20 Terminology around crypto currencies has created a multi billion dollar design problem to fix. Wallets aren't really wallets they're keyrings for personal letter boxes (not just addresses). You can put something in a letter box but you need a (private) key to get it out again.

4030 2018-01-02 19:18:14 Yeah you’re right. Crypto in general is crazy right now. So i can only imagine how much money will go into that. I’m here for it.
4031 2018-01-02 19:18:06 It usually takes reasonable people a short amount of time to figure this shit out and I'd like to see crypto stick around through 2018 so it seems like something needs to get hammered out.

4088 2018-01-02 19:15:29 As far as Wild Crypto (WILD) as of Jan 1st they are selling to the public at the price of 1/100 ETH. This is causing the price to rise rapidly as we traders know it would not be wise to sell lower than that. Expect at least $8.00 when their first game comes out.

4098 2018-01-02 19:14:39 So the part in txt file that says TOR network has integration with wallet that acts like VPN or proxy and hides your transaction ip and shows some TOR ip instead........so that is not what you meant by the tweet saying until verge integrates TOR into core wallet...?
4099 2018-01-02 19:14:39 @coinbase @CoinbaseSupport has the WORST customer service EVERRRRRRRR. Was on hold for an Hour and 18 minutes. Was told my situation would be escalated higher , and in mid conversation she hung up on me  .
4100 2018-01-02 19:14:37 I'd be interested in measuring the temporary productivity loss across all industries as crypto markets make +10% moves. Corporations blocking exchange access from offices more important than blocking social media ;)
4101 2018-01-02 19:14:36 I started trading crypto less then 30 days ago. I put $600 in just to see what happens. I'm sitting @2400 RN.
4102 2018-01-02 19:14:31 ARE YOU READY TO RUMBLE?   Credible sources confirm #xrp to be listed in @coinbase  It's gonna be  #xrp #Ripple

4106 2018-01-02 19:14:18 @aantonop 
There is a lot of discussion regarding like kind (crypto to crypto trades) for 2017. The new tax plan makes it clear that like kind doesn’t apply going forward, but hasn’t been clear about the past.
Any thoughts on how this will play out? (Not asking for tax advice)
4107 2018-01-02 19:14:18 It's too late to buy bitcoin and expect to make massive returns. It's a bubble tbh. You could buy a bunch of other crypto and hedge your bets but honestly I don't see anything blowing up the same way. Ether looks slightly useful at least.

4117 2018-01-02 19:13:24 it's not the community people should fear. It's the greed of big banks who have proven time and time again to be out for themselves and fleece their citizens of their wealth when they get control. Many Crypto communities are wise, loving, open minded & intelligent including $XRP

4139 2018-01-02 19:11:49 My belief has always been institutional flows into crypto would send price way up b/c it's just so much money into low float asset. Question has been will they be willing to? Thiel is a big name that will embolden others, so still very positive going forward imo.

4144 2018-01-02 19:11:27 If you're reading this, and you're new to #crypto, understand that when #bitcoin pumps like this -- inexperienced traders often panic sell their #altcoins to chase the $btc pump. This leads to great entries on #alts. Remember, "Buy the fucking dip." (#btfd).
4145 2018-01-02 19:11:26  Exactly 
Lets wait and watch
4146 2018-01-02 19:11:13 Oh, how I just "love" sudden fall of prices of all ALT coins just as #BTC pumps up in price...
4147 2018-01-02 19:11:10 Don't do any research please... We've just seen what happens to crypto you research about
4148 2018-01-02 19:11:09 Don't be an emotional investor, it makes you look weak.
4149 2018-01-02 19:11:08 Two differences though: A. Peter is a long term investor and not a trader B. Peter takes a very few bets and so when he does, it needs to be evaluated. I don't think crypto is something one should trade. One should take a small position and then forget about it

4212 2018-01-02 19:08:28 $BTC 1h chart just posted massive volume and this could continue rest of the day. From other charts I've seen, BTC could go as high as 16.5k or get resistance along the way. Short-term alt kill, but not death by any means.
4213 2018-01-02 19:08:18 My point is, if BTC price es 14k usd and OMG price is 20 BTC. When BTC goes to 15k usd the price of OMG in BTC not should change necessarily. Drops because everybody runs. But if most hold their OMG, keep their Satoshis at the new BTC price. I know is not working this way.

Plus right now there are issues with its network which is causing spendability problems. Hopefully that gets fixed soon.
4224 2018-01-02 19:07:39 My concern isn’t the price of Ripple. I’ve seen it as low as 20 cent and i still don’t want any because it goes against what crypto stands for. It’s not even decentralized.

4227 2018-01-02 19:07:36 No he doesn't. He shows that stealth addresses work. Which is different to IP obfuscation. That site only takes transactions from certain nodes. His TRX don't even appear on that site. Neither does he highlight them. No ones doubt stealth wallet addresses... its not new tech.
4228 2018-01-02 19:07:31 people might as well just stay in fiat and let the banks control their money that way. only people who will benefit from XRP are early investors. Banks will find a way to screw every day people if its becomes mass adopted.

4240 2018-01-02 19:06:33 Been noticing when #Bitcoin goes up $ALTS go down.  $BTC goes down #altcoins go down, BUT during consolidation #altsareback. I hope this pump keeps going so I can swoop more cheap coins.

4282 2018-01-02 19:02:25 Invest in FirstCoin..Only crypto currency which offers huge profits over investments and opportunity to earn by networking
4283 2018-01-02 19:02:24 Interesting to watch how $BTC rallies/dumps effect different apps/technologies built in and around the #crypto space.

@BlockfolioApp has limited functionality during these moments. Serious stress on the servers.
4284 2018-01-02 19:02:19 umm u need to understand pricing / economic of crypto then. every alt is paired to BTC. if btc is 14k and omg is $20 and btc goes up to 15k and omg stays at $20... how can you expect BTC/OMG pairing to not drop in value?
4285 2018-01-02 19:02:16 I'd argue Ripple $XRP isn't a #crypto as we've come to understand them, it's not a #BlockChain, it's governed by institutions and as such is open to government manipulation.
Look at how #Facebook, another centralised @pmarca play, roles over to #gov insistence

2) estimate btc top using top chartists and mkt sentiment
3) go on CMC and view the top losing coins for 24 hrs and 1 wk
4) buy coins that are down the most
5) search cashtag on twitter to set sells

In the fall of 2017, a new coin was launched - a crypto-thaler TLR. I heard his plan to declare it on your stock exchange. Is this really so?
Thank you.

4365 2018-01-02 18:56:40 I believe some criminals are even running their own crypto currencies. :)
4366 2018-01-02 18:56:38 for me its a way to scale up
4367 2018-01-02 18:56:36 Uh oh.  
4368 2018-01-02 18:56:33 @InSiDeR1000 cutest crypto girl I seen.

4370 2018-01-02 18:56:27 If you get vim sef, try crypto currencies.
4371 2018-01-02 18:56:27 Wait another day it will come to 500 ..with the pace at which it is moving down. .
4372 2018-01-02 18:56:18 So yes it's a failed a attempt. It's like releasing a car without an engine. You don't even understand the tech, you're just a used car salesman pedalling rubbish.
4373 2018-01-02 18:56:16 Like i said - they are working hard on implementing everything and fixing all the bugs. It will come. PATIENCE. No product is ever final, it keeps improving, getting new features and so on. Releasing something step by step is totally okay in developement.
4374 2018-01-02 18:56:13 Go #BTC
4375 2018-01-02 18:56:12 We accept a lot of cryptos! :) only for account holders as we don't want people losing their crypto in guest payments

4383 2018-01-02 18:55:41 I was in college when I first started playing with this $CRYPTO shit. Nobody was interested, but most of my peers could have easily bought 1 or 2 #BTC at prices back then.

4 years later, I guarantee 95+% of the same people have nowhere near 1 $BTC worth of savings / investments.
4384 2018-01-02 18:55:40 you just said it has no utilization to anyone except banks... lol bro you needs banks for this stuff to work safely and broaden use of crypto in general lol
4385 2018-01-02 18:55:38 Bitcoin goes up 4%, alts go down 10% :(
4386 2018-01-02 18:55:35 I bought a ton of $xcp in this dip
4387 2018-01-02 18:55:35 I’m about to totally not buy any crypto I’m pretty thrilled about it!
4388 2018-01-02 18:55:34 こんなときもとにかくアルトガチホ
4389 2018-01-02 18:55:32 Haha cutting my losses with FanDuel. Time for the big boy table. Good luck to you as well brotha!

4391 2018-01-02 18:55:29 Haha yep. Need to keep your eye on $BTC - it's the big poppa of alts for now until they detach themselves.
4392 2018-01-02 18:55:23 Your $XVG coins on their way.  Hope you have fun in #Crypto world. 
4393 2018-01-02 18:55:20 The idiots in the comments talking about crypto prices should be blocked, in my opinion.
4394 2018-01-02 18:55:19 do ALL of it
4395 2018-01-02 18:55:17 Fingers crossed on some of my orders having a chance to fill

4398 2018-01-02 18:55:11 And in my defense- i did send @haydentiff a dm last may to see if she would teach me about crypto- im waiting for her reponse back before I just jump in and buy something- this is risky business @HaraldoXRP - I think im doing okay with my 1 xrp, 1 ada, and 1 trx.. im up to $3
4399 2018-01-02 18:55:11 Centralized bank owned crypto a legitimate Bitcoin rival? Nope
4400 2018-01-02 18:55:11 You like RKC @Crypto_Ed_NL ? Seels like you don't let any grass grow over it he? lol
4401 2018-01-02 18:55:10 How annoying

4403 2018-01-02 18:54:58 so much hustling going on//  btw crypto  weed, AI
4404 2018-01-02 18:54:54 What the hell is going on?!? This is a crazy dip 
4405 2018-01-02 18:54:45 I'm having a good time my first day here on twitter. Since your in the giving mode my address is     DLe4JTMCPefMMDkpUpoGvReAsqcs67hhh4
4406 2018-01-02 18:54:45 Almost every coin is dropping, what's going on??? #cryptocurrency #crypto #xvg #xrp #ADA #TRX
4407 2018-01-02 18:54:44 Yesterday I was explaining what a crypto currency is to someone. The more I explained it the more it made sense. Granted I still think iss a bubble but the question must be asked- why can't we have a digital currency if it basically does the same thing?
4408 2018-01-02 18:54:41 Just fuckin #hodl your $Alts for once!!! $BTC blinks and all else gets dumped. What a shortsighted bunch of greedy $crypto folk #smh
4409 2018-01-02 18:54:41 I still can't believe Trump hasn't once addressed any crypto topic on twitter.
4410 2018-01-02 18:54:39 $bat $eng $powr
4411 2018-01-02 18:54:37 At least I follow them all. Maybe that's why it feels that way. Great guys, ones of the best here :)
4412 2018-01-02 18:54:35 Is crypto, a parameter to judge easy money flowing into the economy as an whole ?
4413 2018-01-02 18:54:30 In 2018 this will be one of the best projects! I recommend everyone to look at it and pouchavstvovat in ICO! Good luck!

4421 2018-01-02 18:53:58 Coins on their way.  Have fun in #Crypto world. 
4422 2018-01-02 18:53:52 I respect your opinion...personally, I feel we live in a world big enough where both centralized and decentralized systems can co-exist...However, for me, crypto should be decentralized..if I wanted to bet on Banks, I'd buy their shares, not their cryptos..
4423 2018-01-02 18:53:50 When you say it's going to be released and don't release,  you lied.  When you keep saying this one small thing and we will make am announcement then you dont,  you lied. Argue w me if you want,  plain and simple majority of crypto investors lost faith in this coin
4424 2018-01-02 18:53:48 Same for me please. Never stopped shilling this coin, wraith has changed crypto. 

DEJVwtERN4gMTk1zQRpgjETQA8FXQjfv1r
4425 2018-01-02 18:53:44 Simply switching from alt to btc is making money ?
4426 2018-01-02 18:53:44 Whether you got into crypto in 2009 or 2017... regardless of your views & expertise... I urge you to never be that person in a debate saying “I bet you’ve only been around here the past year. I’ve been in crypto since xxxx.”

It’s an embarrassing statement for everyone.
4427 2018-01-02 18:53:33 RT @itsrichspicer: $btc is at all time lows for dominance - looks like money is starting to move from the deeper alt coins back to btc - it’s jumped about 10% in the last few hours #crypto #altcoins
4428 2018-01-02 18:53:33 So essentially a bunch of rhetoric? The qt 4.0 at this moment in time is the qt 3.0 with a different UI and stealth addresses. It doesn't currently have IP obfuscation because they haven't yet baked in TOR. They even have it on their official twitter page.
4429 2018-01-02 18:53:32 RT @Jthirdcoast: Don't take my post as bragging, Iv been dirt poor for to long. I want y'all to see #crypto is real and very profitable.
4430 2018-01-02 18:53:21 #Ripple is a private chain governed by #institutions that will perform for the #gov puppet masters.
Re investment, you're right owning $XRP makes sense, but don't purport to be part of the crypto community, you are a sell out...
4431 2018-01-02 18:53:20 RT @oleglnc3n: #ICO #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain
Great team, great company, great road map! I'm sure the company will show great results! Today there is a great urgency of development in this field! I participate in the ICO, and encourage everyone to participate. Good…
4432 2018-01-02 18:53:17 Sure. I guess you love Christmas. Red.
4433 2018-01-02 18:53:16 Get yourself in Andy 
4434 2018-01-02 18:53:11 Him again!  I thought we were over dumping Alts to chase. Oh well. Thanks
4435 2018-01-02 18:53:09 Gotta be in it to make a KINNING! 
4436 2018-01-02 18:53:04 Noice low buys filled
4437 2018-01-02 18:53:00 The potential benefit is typically inverse to the likelihood of a crypto breakthrough. Healthcare is nowhere near.

4453 2018-01-02 18:52:19 Screw stocks bro. Get into crypto with me. We're hitting 50% growth sometimes in 1 day lol. 1000-3000% in a year isn't as crazy as it sounds tbh
4454 2018-01-02 18:52:17 very valid point.
4455 2018-01-02 18:52:15 こういう時のためにビットコインを残しておいてアルトを買い漁らなければいけない #自戒

4465 2018-01-02 18:51:40 Random guy I met a tech party earlier this year (to be fair he turned out to be a crypto expert) advised me to buy XRP. Glad I followed his advice :)

4469 2018-01-02 18:51:25 I just wish, like Ben said ppl were more educated about blockchain and crypto in general before investing. Seeing a 3000% roi is an anomaly and should not be the reason to invest your hard earned money. Ppl NEED to research better and not research on Twitter
4470 2018-01-02 18:51:10 How is it failed attempt? It is released. Mark my words, it's gonna be as good as diamonds once all bugs are fixed. It's recently released product, do you really expect it to be perfect right from start? NO CRYPTO was perfect on first release, no ETH, NO NEO, time to perfect.
4471 2018-01-02 18:51:09 darn...$10K gone
4472 2018-01-02 18:51:08 Rainn. Ever dig into crypto currency? I highly recommend Litecoin. I believe it’s part of our future currency as humans.
4473 2018-01-02 18:51:04 なんかビットコ下がったらアルトコインの売却BOTが発動してるように見えます。
4474 2018-01-02 18:50:56 It really is. We used to spend hours looking at ICOs, built a crazy valuation model. Realized the deals were post-ico for most coins. Switchedour strat to focus post-ico. Recently there have been some really good values in ICOs. something to consider going forward
4475 2018-01-02 18:50:52 I will say this - I’ve learned that multiple green days in a row rarely end well. When I see that everyone has alt euphoria and no one’s managing risk, that’s typically when things start to go sideways.

Crypto doesn’t suffer complacency well!
4476 2018-01-02 18:50:48 ちょっと遅いかもしれないけどバイナンスのアルト全部BTCに戻した。

4479 2018-01-02 18:50:31 Hell yes boys! Could not agree more. Had it since 40 cents.
4480 2018-01-02 18:50:21 I made the crypto pieces a public interface that just works on strings for exactly this purpose. :)

4491 2018-01-02 18:49:36 What cryto are you invested that has not let you down? That is the nature of crypto. #verge has actually delivered on the tech side. Most cryto is just built on hope and wishes. Smh. Some people can not think independently and go with the hype and FUD.

4494 2018-01-02 18:49:33 yep! I have a really hard time saying no, but I thought about it and want to focus on a few core things (VOC, Water polo, work) that opens up time to take care of myself and hobbies / interests (reading, crypto etc).
4495 2018-01-02 18:49:33 BTW crypto currencies como BTC no son un hedge contra ese geopolitical risk.... Son mas bien parte de ese riesgo. Son una herramienta mas del anti-sistema
4496 2018-01-02 18:49:31 The real question is, will you make more money long term investing in crypto or playing poker? 
4497 2018-01-02 18:49:25 When there is a system problem, the best course of action would be to disclose it. Keeping silent and not responding to customer tickets isn’t ideal for crypto currency markets. Don’t you agree @lunomoney ?

4515 2018-01-02 18:48:38 Do you know what pump n dump means? We used XVG. Enjoy our dump.
4516 2018-01-02 18:48:31 A New Year's resolution of mine is to be done with incompetent and/or bad actors in the crypto space.

4517 2018-01-02 18:48:29 @Haejin_Crypto thanks
4518 2018-01-02 18:48:24 You #hodl until there's is no more need for fiat. That, my friend, is a successful hodl.
4519 2018-01-02 18:48:15 @maxkeiser you are right about crypto but like Don Quichot fighting windmills. To break the private national banksters you need a new Waterloo. As they already control this crypto marked.
Do you really think that they sleep? Unfortunately they already rule.
4520 2018-01-02 18:48:10 I think this project is a game changer in how startups are funded. I was really curious what @fredwilson thinks because he is very involved in early vc and crypto. Don't have any questions, just worried about losing private keys = losing equity with no recourse
4521 2018-01-02 18:48:02 @UpsUpsAndDowns Hey fellow Canadian cryptoer (is that a real word). Let me know if there is ever a big crypto related event in Alberta. I want to get in touch with more crypto people. Alberta just got hit by full  bitcoin crazy hype. It's insane.
4522 2018-01-02 18:47:56 And that is why voting sometimes is such a bad idea :D

4524 2018-01-02 18:47:30 That’s what I like to fuckin here bro!! #xvg #vergecoin #wraith get in while it’s cheap boys were going to another fuckin stratosphere 
4525 2018-01-02 18:47:30 Enjoyable article because it hones in a crypto perspective, whether I agree or disagree on any speculation.
4526 2018-01-02 18:47:28 they told me that the world must be bipolar as the earth is with 2 poles and 2 sides, maybe i am out of earth, supra-real ... fiats are real, cryptos are virtual and divine are supra-real money 

 #TradeTokens #TradingRevolution #Crypto #Future
4527 2018-01-02 18:47:26 I also encourage people to consider countering the general rip-off status quo with a position in crypto. (A well researched position. I believe we're entering a new financial paradigm).

4536 2018-01-02 18:46:49 Ripple is governed by a membership of institutions that will roll over to government pressures when it suits,  watch!
It is NOT an openly governed crypto...
4537 2018-01-02 18:46:47 Would u start ur own crypto coin?
4538 2018-01-02 18:46:47 hey man, can you please give me hope... Now verge is at 985 sats, but on your chart you didnt mentionned it was goin to go so low... So is it still goin to rise as you said ? Im just a noob so thx for your time BTW. Moreover, if you can give me a time of rising I would be 
4539 2018-01-02 18:46:46 Some people have asked, "What do I do when I'm not trading #cryptocurrency . " Mostly I do C++, Python, Java, and Ruby on Rails.  Developing a project is 10 hours a day or more.

#bitcoin #Crypto #Developer #bitconnect
4540 2018-01-02 18:46:44 Yeah we will see about that, it may drop to 500, but it gonna go to 10000 also. You are just some crybaby, who is upset by missed deadline while the whole project is working perfectly. I don't even want to laugh on you.

4544 2018-01-02 18:46:24 What is the most hassle free exchange in India for the crypto?
4545 2018-01-02 18:46:24 @ErosCoinNews even you have a project on crypto payments gateway and same project is done by@UTRUST_Official, so there is a big difference in both of you.
#utrust is doing well from the day of listing in the exchanges. It will definitely compete PayPal shortly with its features.
4546 2018-01-02 18:46:22 I got in early Sept this year.  And I can't thank my son enough for the "hey dad check out this crypto thing I've been reading about" conversation we had. 
As well as the too many to mention in the #xrpcommunity. 

Been riding high ever since.

4555 2018-01-02 18:45:50 I think bank transactions take longer, I do not know why. Mine was from Coinbase to Gatehub. And crypto not cash from bank.
4556 2018-01-02 18:45:47 Is the course basically the material in the trading section?
Wanna get my teeth stuck in
4557 2018-01-02 18:45:38 Proper list, though imo $GVT needs to be on it, great project and roadmap for 2018
4558 2018-01-02 18:45:33 Anyone else finding the fees associated with trading crypto to be quite expensive? Especially when you are transferring funds between wallets. #cryptocurrency #btc #Bitcoin #binance
4559 2018-01-02 18:45:33 ...also ur methodology of posturing publicly can be deconstructed through evolutionary psychology - peacock’ing to show dominance and exude testosterone;-P
4560 2018-01-02 18:45:28 In sports it's always the most publicly outraged and outspoken against steroids that are users... Fakesatoshi is the charity scammer of the crypto world.
4561 2018-01-02 18:45:23 Depends on the crypto, if I see an opportunity I will.

4568 2018-01-02 18:45:04 How $ARK isn't on this list blows me away. I imagine folks are voting with their heart instead of their head. Or just voting their bags.
4569 2018-01-02 18:44:55 Crypto is still a little bit gambling, sometimes predictable but sometimes not. I wish you all a beautiful newyear and much profits in 2018 #peace #XVG

4586 2018-01-02 18:44:07 medium:26) The best crypto twitter follows right now are: Tuur Demeester and Ari Paul (trading insights), Jameson Lopp (bitcoin basics and maximalism), Andreas (nails the why), and Neeraj (policy & memes). FortuneLedger actually put together a great list that I mostly agree with.
4587 2018-01-02 18:44:06 Check @Haejin_Crypto blog about XVG one of the most accurate TA so far. It definitely go bullish
4588 2018-01-02 18:44:06 It’s 2018 and I still love Andy just as much as I did in 2017(probably more tbh), even if he won’t stop talking about crypto currency.

4604 2018-01-02 18:43:29 Interesting no $XRP here.  I think it is a total scam, but this last 2 weeks shows anything can be pumped.

4637 2018-01-02 18:41:51 I believe crypto is here to stay. It desperately needs a solid trading platform. Coinbase is sad from what I hear although they are banking coin despite ineptitude . $OSTK can provide that platform.

So plz help me to find the best wallet and advise me for investment  in which crypto currencies for holding some time.
4671 2018-01-02 18:39:35 Not in my list though. Very highly valued crypto coins recently.
4672 2018-01-02 18:39:33 What's more annoying for you to answer, people using market cap as their main argument for XRP not being able to pass $20 or major crypto enthusiasts hating it for being a "bankers coin" or "not what crypto is supposed to be"?
4673 2018-01-02 18:39:19 If citizens in most developing countries have never touched a computer and the access to the internet is low powered androids, what crypto will win? One that is on a confusing exchange or one which is already on an app they use? $kin #kik
4674 2018-01-02 18:39:15 Well they need to start talking to us more too. We are $KIN for life
4675 2018-01-02 18:39:12 Yeah, in the end they can do whatever they want. Coinbase leadership has a strong track record of aligning with the libertarian spirit of crypto though, so I still expect no XRP.
4676 2018-01-02 18:39:09 Failed to Root. Tried many times. Crypto error.
4677 2018-01-02 18:39:08 What miner are you using?
4678 2018-01-02 18:39:04 bitcoin FXは，bitcoinを貯めようとすると難しい。12/1,2の大暴騰と12/15,16の暴騰で大敗。日本円としては少し増えるがbitcoinは減る。bitcoinを貯めるなら，一度両替して，そのまま持っておいた方が無難かも。

4683 2018-01-02 18:38:29 Yeah, my crypto portfolio is 100% bitcoin.  That has *not* been the best financial decision.  But frankly I don't like any of the alts and I just refuse to buy them on principle.  That bull-headedness has only cost me millions of dollars, but whatever.
4684 2018-01-02 18:38:23 Right, because the wild west is such a trustworthy frontier

4692 2018-01-02 18:38:02 Unforeseen problem: inventors are notoriously bad entrepreneurs. Is Charlie technically sophisticated to integrate crypto as the world's primary currency? Arguably so. But does he have the vision, the spirit and the drive?

4694 2018-01-02 18:37:58 bitcoin will show who is the boss of crypto very soon!!! and you will cry with your alt btc cash
4695 2018-01-02 18:37:57 $CRYPTO The short-term price variations do not matter, but the utility of the currency. If it has intrinsic value, it will survive any widespread breakdown. It will fall, but then it will recover, as it did with $AMZN and many other companies after the outbreak in the '90s.

4747 2018-01-02 18:34:22 As a strict onramp into bitcoin from nocoiners to their first coin, Coinbase's fate was sealed at launch: they'll continue to help newbies get their first crypto until everyone has gotten their first crypto...

4809 2018-01-02 18:30:46 XVG is not a normal crypto - it was artificially pumped (1sat in Aprl, 40 sats in Dec)- it's a very high risk alt. TA's can be extremly not accurate. It can be dumped down to 50 sat in one second. Wraith protocol is ctrl+c Ctrl+v from old shadowcoin. Just be carefull with it pls.

4823 2018-01-02 18:29:47 Def need some moderators on your happy hour streams. That live feed is cluttered.
4824 2018-01-02 18:29:47 Also... 
11. What's wrong with Caradano? High valuation way too early?
14. Nope. 2017 was unquestionably the year of the ICO.
16. You're partially right. But they will still launch.
17. Self-governing crypto without forks are the future. Also we have not seen the end of ICOs.
4825 2018-01-02 18:29:43 Please dont trade, risk of losing money is high. Just hold

4846 2018-01-02 18:29:08 Crypto currency was supposed to be decentralised and available for the masses. But yet here we are, exchanges have turned out to be gods for common people, milking customers with huge margins in buy/sell prices and high trading fees

4960 2018-01-02 18:21:27 Actually I said "junk food" which means a whole gamut of food in which candy is a small percentage. Next, you just put evolutionary psychology and biodeterminism forward as credible science. Lmfao: get off my timeline you clearly are anti-scientific.

4962 2018-01-02 18:21:25 It looks like kind exchanges for deferred capital gains applies explicitly to real estate only going forward. No guidance on crypto, or whether like kind transactions in 2017 apply.
4963 2018-01-02 18:21:21 I think Trx will dominate crypto the next month tbh, coin burn, source code release etc.. Its basically creating its own etherium
4964 2018-01-02 18:21:19 why not ? can you ellaborate?:)
4965 2018-01-02 18:21:19 $crypto market cap swells to $664 billion on $51 billion 24 hr. volume. $btc dominance down to 35.7%. Thirty-six (36) tokens now top $1 billion -- including $DOGE. What times are these. #blockchainrevolution
4966 2018-01-02 18:21:18 barry plz
4967 2018-01-02 18:21:17 Well...or you acquire a real world asset with your crypto gains and then you get investigated and then have to explain where the ‘money’ come from. As the old saying goes...there are only two certainties in life...

4985 2018-01-02 18:19:37 For the enthusiastic crypto buyers today: it's easy to buy at an ATH of a coin. It's not quite so easy (but much more profitable) to accumulate during 40%-50% retraces. 

Yep, that means that the 70% gain just turned into a -15% loss. Welcome to $crypto folks.
4986 2018-01-02 18:19:34 Haha. Yep, I'm in Litecoin for the long run, looking for mainstream adoption in the next 90 days.

5057 2018-01-02 18:14:53 I think that could be said of any crypto these days.  BTC being a catalyst as a largely successful proof of concept which literally created a whole new realm of economics: Cryptoeconomics

5063 2018-01-02 18:14:25 Maybe "thug" is a little strong.  But how should one explain crypto without sounding "glib" ... not that it matters how we sound?!  It's our investment, win or lose.

I have done the math and had I invested in bitcoin this past year I would be 2.7mil ahead! Harold from Cle 
5074 2018-01-02 18:13:56 It's ridiculous, especially on crypto to crypto trades. To calculate gains on each transaction between BTC and alts is impossible - the dollar value of BTC changes by the second. and each exchanges assigns a different value.
5075 2018-01-02 18:13:51 Soon, all businesses will be on some sort of blockchain. Payments will be made seamlessly frome one crypto to another with cross chain swaps. There won't be one coin above all others that is universally used. Surprised many don't understand this.
5076 2018-01-02 18:13:51 All you're doing is speculating and making excuses for a 3rd failed attempt at releasing wraith.

5082 2018-01-02 18:12:55 Ain’t that the truth. 6 hour and 8 hour are juicy as well. Low timeframe pattern obsession is indicative of the level of patience of newcomers to crypto. They want to see 2x tomorrow, not a week or a month.
5083 2018-01-02 18:12:48 sad to see this - crypto-communities are here to unite, not to separate... think (!!!)
5084 2018-01-02 18:12:46 I intend to post quality over quantity. Solid plays that are most likely winners barring any unforeseen market changes. Remember $BTC still is the market maker and ALT coins follow. Any significant volatility in $BTC will cause volatility in your alt coin setups.
5085 2018-01-02 18:12:44 Do your research on TRON. Its not just for gaming. But if that's is all u know, that's all u know. I agree $50 is a pipe dream in the next 3-5 years but this crypto world has shown us to be wrong before. i say 1-2 by June 2.5-5 by Dec 2018

5090 2018-01-02 18:12:30 No because those ideas are still very public and have their own platforms. In fact even Mill would say that the "marketplace of ideas" is not violated if you don't provide people with platforms that they can provide for themselves.

5097 2018-01-02 18:11:53 Best question I get when helping people with crypto: “Ok so, what do you want from me?” I want us to crash the banks together, that is all 
5098 2018-01-02 18:11:50 Soon though. Soon.
5099 2018-01-02 18:11:43 I hate that it's a blockchain centralized coin backed by the bank of London.

5104 2018-01-02 18:11:10 Biggest advice on trading crypto I can give: You cannot play this game with emotion. If you're watching an asset rise or fall and buy or sell based on the emotions attached to that, you'll be wrong 99% of the time. Trust the TA. Step back and analyze. Trading on emotion=REKT

5106 2018-01-02 18:10:54 Pero no se trata de un curso especializado en criptodivisas, se enseñan particularidades de los mercados y reglas concretas de entrada y salida para crear estrategias tendenciales.
5107 2018-01-02 18:10:49 Pre-congrats on another strong year of crypto gains
5108 2018-01-02 18:10:49 Interested and somewhat amused by how many people in the last 6 months have added the phrases “ICO”, “crypto” and “Blockchain” to their LinkedIn and Twitter profiles.

5112 2018-01-02 18:10:37 It almost reflects an act of quarantine

5116 2018-01-02 18:10:32 How can you say that he's hacked? He is posting these blogs from his personal steemit account. Please go some other places instead of blindly hating on him.
5117 2018-01-02 18:10:23 $Waves must be in the top-10.

5119 2018-01-02 18:10:15 Ur in a sense activating a form of discipline to control the distribution of power. In this case it is public voice or public engagements through. If u excersize discipline of controlling or denying that platform you are able to control the power enacted.
5120 2018-01-02 18:10:03 Amazing if true!

5328 2018-01-02 17:56:43 Verge always being compared to the big boys....that should tell people something.   You should be supporting Verge just out of its sure potential.    Its what helps solidify the goal of cryptocurrency in general which is privacy.

5333 2018-01-02 17:56:17 The alts pumping (mostly the "shitcoins") everyone mentions are probably due to them being priced so cheaply and new money joining the cryptosphere. People look for what's cheap and has possibility of quick gains. Now if they hold and get rekt is a different story lol #crypto

5335 2018-01-02 17:56:15 Great things take time, dev work can't be rushed, problems pop up that need fixing with new releases. Be realistic.

5350 2018-01-02 17:55:11 OH for anyone who has invested in MCO  the Dev waits till the very last high point and sells off a tremendous volume of shares-   500,000 at a time.  So be cautious it may be to reinvest in the company but it hurts the hands who feed him.
5351 2018-01-02 17:55:11 どこからが煽りになるんだろう？

無駄に周りを巻き込む必要はない。
それは同感。

ただ、待ちに待った情報が発表されたら共有するよね？
カウントダウンされたら、何のことだと話し合うよね？

これまでのイメージもあるのかもしれませんが、年に一度の祭りは盛り上がらせてください。

5385 2018-01-02 17:52:30 100$
5386 2018-01-02 17:52:30 My coins are gone now, what happened?
5387 2018-01-02 17:52:26 $DRGN is not done. @dragonchaingang is a $1b+ cap project. Along the likes of the $ICX. Be smart if you decide to take profits, avoid selling your entire position. Several future ICOs coming out on the Dragonchain blockchain. Will be a top 25 coin soon.
5388 2018-01-02 17:52:24 DYOR brother, $Xrp was NEVER intended to be used by the banks...If you researched it, you would know that.
5389 2018-01-02 17:52:23 dont have many followers at all. But, this Crypto community is amazing.

5393 2018-01-02 17:52:07 If crypto is the ruler to measure by, isn't every asset tanking terribly annually now? What is there that can be a certain standard? The main reason gold worked was gov't setting (read: enforcing) the price.
5394 2018-01-02 17:52:04 KYC?
5395 2018-01-02 17:52:04 Yup... same here.

They named it Bezop after the name of the founder of Amazon - Jeff Bezos.

5397 2018-01-02 17:51:43 Why IOTA is the crypto to watch. 1. No transaction fees 2. No separation between users and validators 3. Number of IOTA coins is premined (fixed) 4. Focused on serving as the backbone of the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) and hence AI and Robotics. 5. At under $5..very cheap.
5398 2018-01-02 17:51:39 
5399 2018-01-02 17:51:31 I appreciate it! I’m working really hard to try to make the best content I can
5400 2018-01-02 17:51:22 I share ur opinion on this one!
5401 2018-01-02 17:51:21 Can Canadians trade on that exchange?
5402 2018-01-02 17:51:21 Stick with $LTC, as 2018 will be a BOOMING year for #Litecoin! It's so underrated right now, so I'm buying as much as I can while the price is still cheap!
5403 2018-01-02 17:51:18 Nice call mate. It looks strong here
5404 2018-01-02 17:51:14 If you have #coinbase is there anyway to get access to the forks not supported?
5405 2018-01-02 17:51:10 No problem! I love this coin long-term. Don't buy into the hate against it bc is a "bankers" coin. If it can make you money in the end, who cares.
5406 2018-01-02 17:51:04 Its cheaper now
5407 2018-01-02 17:50:58 This is a great, counterintuitive trading insight I got from a successful Japanese stock market day trader. He made his money during the Abenomics full retard quantitative easing run up: Buy what is being bought. Sell what is being sold. #crypto With $BTC, though, just hodl, obv
5408 2018-01-02 17:50:58 If @AlgonquinColleg could confirm my enrollment for next semester already so I could use my student loans to by extremely risky altcoins, that would be great thx #bitcoin #altcoins #Crypto

5410 2018-01-02 17:50:42 Crypto technology is not mentioned in the Quran 
5411 2018-01-02 17:50:40 Failing companies are pivoting to crypto to boost their stock. Case in point: soft drink-maker Long Island Tea Corp saw a 500% bump after renaming itself “Long Blockchain Corp,” despite striking a juice distribution deal just last week. Seems legit…
5412 2018-01-02 17:50:39 Would be interesting to see how many times per day the average user opens @BlockfolioApp a day. #bitcoin #crypto
5413 2018-01-02 17:50:32 Will she cross $15 this week? $BB Shorts Panic and cover, no sellers, stock goes to over $30? @JohnChen may go sadistic on $bb shorts. and announce blockchain/crypto deal
5414 2018-01-02 17:50:31 There's also talk about these Terrorist jihadists groups using these crypto currency's like bitcoin to finance some of their terrorist activities! What has the administration or anyone in Congress propose to do about it? Nothing! They aren't even talking about it!
5415 2018-01-02 17:50:30 how can i join saw your post was interesting and new to crypto hope i stand a chances to win some XVG coins from you
5416 2018-01-02 17:50:28 I am so excited to invest in crypto so I can spend money on Indycar!!!!!!!!
5417 2018-01-02 17:50:12 How long do you all anticipate this ride to last? seems like theres some hold up 9500-11000
5418 2018-01-02 17:50:05 And you r being a crybaby here. Don't hang up on small things. Think about the whole picture. Just cause they missed deadline, it doesnt make lie. Do you what is lie, #xrp said it will announcing their big partner in Q4 of 2017, where is the announcement?? That's a lie. #XVGFam
5419 2018-01-02 17:49:56 Plus I'm hodling this crypto.

5424 2018-01-02 17:49:38 Remember what I said about digital currencies giving countries new options, such as Venezuela dealing with US-led sanctions? Now, Russia is allegedly working on its own crypto currency to bypass economic sanctions.
5425 2018-01-02 17:49:28 In regards to crypto this new taxbill is just hilarious
5426 2018-01-02 17:49:27 For those who missed the recent ICO, CRYPTO20, the first crypto-only tokenized index fund, will be tradable on 15 January 2018! #crypto #trading
5427 2018-01-02 17:49:23 Teaching myself about Steem Dollars. Happy 2018! Happy New Money! May the crypto gods be with you.
5428 2018-01-02 17:49:23 Have spent the last few days moving profits around and re-balancing the portfolio. Pleased to welcome $XBY and $ENG to my team, I have high hopes for these two in 2018.
5429 2018-01-02 17:49:08 @naval says there is no quick money making schemes but still supports all this  flowing in and out of crypto currencies and possibly invested a lot into it too.  

Do I spot something ?

5431 2018-01-02 17:49:05 When is the Air Drop and if our coins are stored in desktop wallet, is that all we have to do to get air drop coins?
5432 2018-01-02 17:49:05 "If a man also spend with crypto, as he spendeth with a state-issued fiat currency, he has committed an abomination: he shall surely be put to death; his blood shall be upon him."

5433 2018-01-02 17:49:05 I was once able to find good crypto news on Twitter. Now searching for a coin's tag and you're flooded with exchange referral link garbage and memes.
5434 2018-01-02 17:48:45 People are UNDER estimating how much #crypto is going to grow in 2018. From 3% adoption, we will massively boom to 10% adoption quickly. At 10% population adoption, all hell breaks loose. 10 Trillion marketcap for 2018 is my conservative prediction. Do your own research peeps
5435 2018-01-02 17:48:39 武家やし…

5441 2018-01-02 17:48:20 Guys just jump in on emotion!! It has 2 more days approximately before the uptrend. The total consolidation period has yet to come. Xvg will drop down into the 1010-1030’s. Prior to its trend to all time highs. IF anyone could help read the SC chart or XDN on Bittrex-don’t get it
5442 2018-01-02 17:48:09 Very good stuff, so it’s commercialising and being adopted in the real world. Thanks for the info !
5443 2018-01-02 17:48:09 It looks like you don't know much about programs & coding. You don't know how much effort it needs to solve unpredictable bugs & give better(perfect) program. And soon you will know who is dumber. it might not go up today or tomorrow, but it will go up.

5446 2018-01-02 17:47:57 Where do you go to add? Been investing/trading for years but any link to find out about crypto would be appreciated - thanks.

5459 2018-01-02 17:46:59 2017 I made a great return in $crypto, but more important- I learned A LOT! 2018, I plan to take what I learned with $50k & turn it to $1m. Lofty goal, yes- but possible. 

Would you want to follow me on this journey by tracking my blockfolio?

5461 2018-01-02 17:46:57 TODAY I joined Kucoin, and then NOTHING works :( when will your exchange start working again do you think? no login, 2step veri spamming every time I click a button. Hope it will improve as I can't withdraw any of my crypto.

5470 2018-01-02 17:45:45 Being a part of a $crypto bull market is like winning the lottery every day. Every time you open blockfolio you're surprised by the gains you've made.
5471 2018-01-02 17:45:33 There's a lot going well for it: Forbes 500 company with gr8 CEO, coalition of banks keeps on growing and adopting it, new digital payment systems being introduced, Asian markets love it, media coverage, and it has real-life functionality
5472 2018-01-02 17:45:27 Funny ))))
5473 2018-01-02 17:45:27 今年が始まって思ったこと
ビットコインは他のアルトコインに食われてしまうのではないかということ。
ビットコインは、仮想通貨を牽引してきたが、現在では送金の遅さや、手数料の高さなど、かつてはメリットであった部分に問題が生じてしまっている。
果たして通貨としての機能はあるのだろうか。
5474 2018-01-02 17:45:10 I'm sure there is a crypto currency somewhere that self expires

5482 2018-01-02 17:43:49 All the people who dont understand crypto but hate it think this is all bitcoin.
5483 2018-01-02 17:43:40 For any crypto heads should I invest my $BTC into $Ripple or just invest new money to ripple?
5484 2018-01-02 17:43:36 違う商売じゃん。

5487 2018-01-02 17:43:21 Yeah already took some profits and made my baggs a bit smaller. Still most of my coins are long term. Made a ton of money in my first year in crypto :)
5488 2018-01-02 17:43:17  My TOP picks #hodl for 2018 are: $lmc $hat $waves $nuls $etp $poll $wabi $gxs $icx & maybe $utk  #crypto #cryptocurrency #hold

5513 2018-01-02 17:41:26 Crypto twitter today has many young men who think their BTC hodlings entitle them to a girlfriend, which is good bc the healthiest relationships are based on money.
5514 2018-01-02 17:41:22 If a bubble persists for long enough it becomes self-fulfilling. Is that where crypto finds itself today?

5528 2018-01-02 17:40:21 How will crypto improve financial services? What kind of services? Remittances are already done, and it's only for a small portion of the population. Payment systems need to be better than payment thru cellphones to be competitive. So what specifically are you thinking???

5531 2018-01-02 17:40:11 it's a fugazi my friend,you will never predict if it will go up,down or sideways .
5532 2018-01-02 17:40:11 Right on! Be intouch...
5533 2018-01-02 17:40:10 Which cryptocurrency exchange has the best Fiat/Crypto exchange?
5534 2018-01-02 17:40:06 But in @binance_2017  part part buy/ sell of.. a small amount 
And you cant sell all 100% coin 
Still a little amount is stay back in exchange.  Its not a matter for a small BTC coin but. LTC ETH..its do matter
5535 2018-01-02 17:40:04 New is expensive. Join ravelous now! @ravelousmarket #ico#crypto#ravelous#moon
5536 2018-01-02 17:40:00 As nice of guy as I am, I asked what it was worth to you because I would be willing to part with it for a price. But seeing as you have no Crypto, I am not sure I want to let it go to someone who's not in the game or new to it.  Theres gotta be a rich stoner out there somewhere.
5537 2018-01-02 17:39:58 #XVG is steadily driving back up!  More people will begin to believe and then we're going to see it moonshot!  #Crypto #Binance #Altcoins #altcoin
5538 2018-01-02 17:39:43 I am interested in that coin but the sell wall has me nervous...

5541 2018-01-02 17:39:32 Hopefully crypto currency booms this year 
5542 2018-01-02 17:39:29 Who would trade in and out of USD? That's dumb, each one of those is a taxable action; tax reform hasn't changed like-kind exchanges, therefore always trade in and out of some other crypto-currency.

5544 2018-01-02 17:39:23 Post was meant to have ? At the end. So that’s what I want to know. Why will it get bigger ? With its market cap; how big can it actually get ?
5545 2018-01-02 17:39:11 Newbie here :) What platform for crypto exchange is the best for you? I've heard of Kraken but in the last 2017 was bad
5546 2018-01-02 17:39:09 I put my ranking exchanges in my order (based on months of trading):
1. #binance (low fees, a lot of currencies, fast confirmations - I don't even care, where are they from)
2. #bittrex (a bit high fees, a lot of confirmations)
3. #poloniex ? (high fees, have they support?)
5547 2018-01-02 17:39:08 While we’re casting stones, what about our FCC and Net Neutrality? Seems like the world needs a regime change.   #staysavy #pirateparty

5554 2018-01-02 17:38:25 This is due to shit supporters like @XVGWhale  and PR team. ..this school drop out would have invested 1000 in the begining and now sitting and tweeting like a silly monkey..!! Only reason I see now to leave verge is ppl like xvg whale

5561 2018-01-02 17:37:46 Yep I saw this too. I feel a lot more confident in my overall investment now. Once I have a 100-200% ROI I will probably get out in favor of projects that are more reliable. #XVG is an amazing #crypto but I don't like the unpredictability of the dev and main influencer (XVGWhale)

May I  ask you or someone from your congregation how, with the potential for possible major profits in this crypto investing, how they are handling the taxes on their investments. Individually? As property? 
DM responses are fine.
Thank you sir!

5576 2018-01-02 17:36:38 With crypto currency trading it's tough... Look at Ethereum - currently rising super fast. Are people now seeing the value? I saw it months ago, always thought it would run up like this, never knew when. Why  now and not then? Or not in a few months? Ugh

5583 2018-01-02 17:36:10 I disagree. I work with those up and coming artists exclusively. The biggest challenge is not getting them to look at crypto as a means of earning money. The biggest challenge is getting them to think like startup founders — which is exactly what they are.
5584 2018-01-02 17:35:38 @cryptomanran would you be able to advise whether a company named Affinity Mining is a legit crypto company or one of the scam schemes that are exploiting in the name of crypto?

5597 2018-01-02 17:34:47 Correct. But there are twitter handles out there that do actually try to help people so I don't want to just cast a big brush over those who actually care about the crypto community. But yes. DYOR is a must.

5688 2018-01-02 17:27:56 Crypto traders will tell you when to buy, but rarely when to sell, why? Because they sell on the way up. Find points you will be happy to take profits at, sell there and move on. Never get stuck holding a bag. Don't be mad if the bag keeps moving. profit = profit.

i am a software developer. Let me make this clear before this links gets fudded. thats a developer job to make this work where justin is working. Just to make sure everything works good developers keep release dates. My point is build success and failure happen.

5723 2018-01-02 17:25:40 Defining structure separates the best chartists from the rest of us. But the really strong ones are more likely to just breakout trade for themselves and margin trade, rather than teaching the rest.

5731 2018-01-02 17:25:07 So ya girl successfully figured out how to purchase #xrp. Crypto currency purchasing is not for the faint of heart. 
5732 2018-01-02 17:25:03 The greatest difference and flaw in you analogy is that $XVG is open-source, so you can see the work happening before your eyes... It's more like the ride at Jurassic Park where you get to peer into the window of the lab where the developers are creating the magic.

5752 2018-01-02 17:23:01 I have to disagree. I don't pretend to know whether bitcoin will keep its #1 place, but I can say with confidence that it wont lose a lot of its value very soon.
Gold, didnt lose its value because it was difficult to transport or use in day to day transactions. Just my opinion

5762 2018-01-02 17:22:17 As a general policy I do not comment publicly about crypto projects. I do think it’s far to early to be claiming that any project is a major piece of society. We’re just not there yet.
5763 2018-01-02 17:22:09 Give me an example, where crypto did not fall down after that much gains? You were advising people to buy at the top spikes.

Now question to the community:
What would you do if you had listened to @XVGWhale

5808 2018-01-02 17:19:16 Bah.. pat on the back for everyone! Get on with it, enough with the indulgence. Give it a few more years and the US will have the frickin "Crypto Awards" brought to you by MTV where everyone can blow smoke up each other's arses en masse! #xrp #ripple #holdingxrp
5809 2018-01-02 17:19:13 Still not sure how this relates to crypto currencies. But I'm down with getting paid.
5810 2018-01-02 17:19:08 This can only be one man...and you never really kill Chuck Norris. He just lets your gun take a break.
5811 2018-01-02 17:19:06 It would be nice if the pineapple fund was able to establish a non-profit specifically to raise awareness of crypto and bitcoin.
5812 2018-01-02 17:18:57 I've been thinking about getting into crypto currency. If along my research I find what you're asking for I will happily notify you.
5813 2018-01-02 17:18:53 Crypto signal:

TKS pump at Bittrex happening now.
5814 2018-01-02 17:18:50 Bunu biliyorum fakat crypto dünyasına etki edeceğinden emin değilim. Benim bilmediğim daha kuvvetli emareler yoksa tabii.

5816 2018-01-02 17:18:46 @Ozarktrades where did you learn TA?
5817 2018-01-02 17:18:31 #XVG Is it SOOOO HARD to post an official announcement from the devs of this project?!? They should have done this by now to preserve the value of their crypto which IS CLEARLY GOING DOWN due to all the FUD! 
You cannot blame the FUD if the devs arent comin out to say anything!!
5818 2018-01-02 17:18:29 ehhh slow and steady growth from bitcoin is good for alts. If BTC starts adding a thousand a day or something crazy the alts will take a huge bath

5839 2018-01-02 17:16:59 Are you % sure about your technical analysis ?
5840 2018-01-02 17:16:49 get your $xcp before it is too late
5841 2018-01-02 17:16:48 If you lose money in the crypto space you literally have no idea wtf you’re doing lol
5842 2018-01-02 17:16:47 When it makes me a million this year I'll ask for your wallet address  might give you a couple bucks
5843 2018-01-02 17:16:40 wrong usage of trendlines, placing support where is no support. Using different timeframes to show it in his advantage. Wrong explanation to the indicators. Hyping followers into a trade in the middle of a pattern. Grabbing charts from paying members and publish it himself
5844 2018-01-02 17:16:40 Ooo Türkmüşsün hocam. Hemen soralım o zaman. Buradan girilir mi?  Hedef kaç? 
5845 2018-01-02 17:16:39 How long should one #hodl for for it to be classed as a successful hodl ?? When should take profit occur... 
5846 2018-01-02 17:16:35 A lot of people think they are making money trading when they are just providing liquidity and exits to early arrivers. Always ask, how much money did I make if everything I own goes to 0.
5847 2018-01-02 17:16:33 you cant compare price like that..
5848 2018-01-02 17:16:27 I find it quite hard to understand that way of thinking sometimes. If something I cheap anywhere else, people buy it. Apply it to literally ANYTHING else, and you’d buy it. But Crypto? People start panicking! I don’t get it.

5851 2018-01-02 17:16:20 Nah Im not going to give that mediocre the attention he is looking for :)
5852 2018-01-02 17:16:13 shit this is crypto, one day you're down, the next you're up 3x
5853 2018-01-02 17:16:09 Plz do some review for nav coin
5854 2018-01-02 17:16:08 Have been seeing this for the last two days but notjing happening. .!!
5855 2018-01-02 17:16:00 Trading crypto can get emotional. Don't scared of a dip. Do your research a hold for long term gainz. $trx $xrp don't put Money in you can't afford to lose, but invest like you already won. Let's get that money. #HODL
5856 2018-01-02 17:15:58 Had this since .02 It didn't do much for a long while (in crypto world) but I ever time I checked the price, Jeff's voice would say "HODL" . thanks Jeff. You are a wise crypto master haha
5857 2018-01-02 17:15:55 Who's buying #BitcoinCash in 2018 and why? #BCH #Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC
5858 2018-01-02 17:15:49 ahorrarias en fees, si pagas muchos fees es lo ideal
5859 2018-01-02 17:15:46 Plz do some review for nav coin
5860 2018-01-02 17:15:45 It Is playing hard to get , like wtf
5861 2018-01-02 17:15:39 #Steem and #BitShares have a great team and are among the most used #Crypto in the market.  Both enjoyed steady increases over the last few months. hodl, hodl
5862 2018-01-02 17:15:36 An exchange is a place where you can store balances in multiple cryptocurrencies, but you don't own the private keys, so you are trusting the exchange when crypto is about independence. Jaxx is a wallet for multiple cryptos
5863 2018-01-02 17:15:35 Good work.  Saw this elsewhere.  $XVG to 5!
5864 2018-01-02 17:15:29 Alt Coins are the future of crypto and tech/innovation.  BTC paved the way for the next big thing, but an Alt Coin will take what BTC started to the next level we just have to figure out which one it is and jump on board early
5865 2018-01-02 17:15:26 But I share the skepticism about crypto currency in its current state.
5866 2018-01-02 17:15:25 Looks like criminal empires are dropping #bitcoin as their crypto-currency according to reports. Now might be the time to sell folks as that inevitable #bitcoincrash could be on its way......
5867 2018-01-02 17:15:23 @Crypto_BOOOOM yep yep I hope you caught alert!!

#SEGI & #FUTL has been killer from pre Xmas alerts and Grinding!!
5868 2018-01-02 17:15:21 meaning ALTS will go to moon or ALTS will decrease ?
5869 2018-01-02 17:15:20 I’m new to #Crypto, but definitely buying #Polymath once it’s avail. Excited to see what happens
5870 2018-01-02 17:15:08 
5871 2018-01-02 17:15:06 確かに親戚集まりした時に仮想通貨で儲けてることを話すってことをやってる人多いと思う。
「身近で成功している人がいるんだ」と思うことで仮想通貨人口は増えそうだね。
5872 2018-01-02 17:14:55 predictions fs-2018: 
#1: Web 3.0 permissionless blockchain gain traction
#2: Institutions increase knowledge to safely invest in crypto
#3 ICO’s will get smaller and more legitimate
#4: malicious ICO will die
#5: 2018 is the year crypto will grow up
#blockchainrobby
5873 2018-01-02 17:14:53 Its what happens when you have a gmoney thug who got into crypto 2 months ago trying to act like hes seasoned. Lmao bch is good. buy verge. Is bitcnnect also good? Rofl
5874 2018-01-02 17:14:50 $Dent please!!!!

5878 2018-01-02 17:14:30 Are we going to be ok? #Teamxvg
5879 2018-01-02 17:14:23 Always gonna be winners and losers. People need cash. There’s an opportunity in crypto just not for everyone. At a couple $100 bucks for huge returns it’s easy to see y guy on st is rolling the dice
5880 2018-01-02 17:14:23 That will be one million dollar plz
5881 2018-01-02 17:14:20 Dip?
5882 2018-01-02 17:14:10 Maybe I'm too naive for crypto, but for instance $xem.
Hodling on to this although they haven't released their catapult update (as promised!) in 2017. No dip/drama there BTW.  They have been working on other interesting stuff as well.
5883 2018-01-02 17:14:06

5886 2018-01-02 17:13:50 Someone add me to a crypto group
5887 2018-01-02 17:13:48 Buy #Stellar #Lumens while it’s still under $1.00. That means buy it before Friday!!! #XLM #StellarLumens #bitcoin #crypto #IBM #payments #money
5888 2018-01-02 17:13:42 Just watch. Get on board and hold!

5890 2018-01-02 17:13:33 Why would u do that lol u already got the followers bra smart
5891 2018-01-02 17:13:32 Is this guy amazing or what. Watch the tutorials on YouTube over and over. Such a blessing to have found his gift that he gives for free.
5892 2018-01-02 17:13:20 Oh stop. Block chain & crypto currency aren't the same thing.
5893 2018-01-02 17:13:18 Perfect BUY spot right now for $TRX
5894 2018-01-02 17:13:13 The crypto-love is real though.
5895 2018-01-02 17:12:59 Gotta keep them crypto keys safe
5896 2018-01-02 17:12:58 Looking at the marketcap of bitcoin other altcoins. in 2018, bitcoin may lose its position to altcoin. This I have never imagined before. That day is not quite far. I see this as possibility
5897 2018-01-02 17:12:54 $nav is far superior to $xmr when it comes to usability and anonymity imho.  Hodling $xvg and $nav - great privacy coins with the latter staking
5898 2018-01-02 17:12:52 I hope you stay, but good luck with whatever you decide to do, David. I’m new at crypto and would have bombed out had it not been for you. Thanks for your guidance while I got started. Wishing you peace and happiness. 
5899 2018-01-02 17:12:52 As a noob what i look for in a crypto team is a Sheldonesque UV deprived coder (the more pasty and limp looking the better), and someone on the financial side must have a bow tie, beyond that i haven't really thought things through much further #BTC #ETH #ALTCOINS #Cryptocurrency

5909 2018-01-02 17:12:07 Involved, I think go has well
5910 2018-01-02 17:12:06 Crypto friends: need more Slack/Discord groups about trading/mining. 

(Yes, I am down the rabbit hole. Again. Even though I've been doing the Bitcoin thing for 5 years now, alt coins moving so fast)

Suggestions?
5911 2018-01-02 17:12:06 Use crypto next time
5912 2018-01-02 17:11:57 2 big hurdles people forget for adoption to occur.People need to access it easily. All crypto's are hard to get hold of & confusing af.The second is the mental barrier. large numbers of bitcoin and etherium -confusing- Normal consumer needs 2 calculate back to fiat. $kin will win
5913 2018-01-02 17:11:53 Pehle spelling to sikh lijiye sir. Crypto.
5914 2018-01-02 17:11:52 Horrible writing on my handy, sorry!
5915 2018-01-02 17:11:48 The winner in crypto world is who can own as much as he can of Bitcoin not altcoin keep this in your mind. Remember also that all these shitty altcoin is created for one reason which is to collect the Bitcoin
5916 2018-01-02 17:11:45 What about crypto puppies airdrop from $NEO?
5917 2018-01-02 17:11:44 $STRAT has no choice.
5918 2018-01-02 17:11:42 I have my eyes on two new birds now, #Aion and #EDG

5926 2018-01-02 17:11:07 crypto-Papal, my new fav adjective!
5927 2018-01-02 17:11:02 Sold!!!!  Hahaha....I got in today so I’ll hold for maybe 2 years.  This coin has a great platform!
5928 2018-01-02 17:11:02 Some positive news ..you speak technically Haejin. .but there is a lot of FUD. .hope this prediction comes true..!! Thanks
5929 2018-01-02 17:10:57 @smargasy what's your opinion on the SEC and Crypto?
5930 2018-01-02 17:10:56 Bought back into $TRX 524 after sell profit at 622. #Crypto #Tron
5931 2018-01-02 17:10:54 There are some unwritten rules in crypto world 

#1 always be aware if ref links 
#2 don't invest money you can't afford to lose
#3 Do not beg for money
5932 2018-01-02 17:10:45 no doubt ripple will help banks. I agree. Xrp does little for us and it's market cap is hype from newbies not understanding what it is. It is a small coin in grand scheme of crypto that will help banks. It will drop in price take profit
5933 2018-01-02 17:10:40 I like your tweets for BCH, but not so much with Ripple. All Bitcoin really needs is the lightning network for very fast transactions and low fees. No coin will ever overthrow it once it has the lightning network
5934 2018-01-02 17:10:38 TRUE!!!!
5935 2018-01-02 17:10:33 I see a lot of "more interviews" suggestions. Not super keen on that idea. Love your show the way it is--your thoughts and opinions on the crypto industry (I should have listened better; you talked about Cardano for weeks before it shot up).
5936 2018-01-02 17:10:29 Yes baby
5937 2018-01-02 17:10:19 You and @CryptoChoe are providing a lot of hope for $XVG charts. Been holding and accumulating (now 500k) for weeks. Still, I still think XVG at this point is greatly affected by FA than TA. Hope your analyses come true!
5938 2018-01-02 17:10:18 
5939 2018-01-02 17:09:57 So does $gas
5940 2018-01-02 17:09:55 great!
5941 2018-01-02 17:09:51 Follow me back please.
5942 2018-01-02 17:09:46 But do the laws favor Crypto? Ive heard that each individual crypto transaction counts as a taxable event now? Keeping track of that is a nightmare.
5943 2018-01-02 17:09:43 #swissborgico #ico #eth good project 
5944 2018-01-02 17:09:38 Man I LOVE the first couple lines...

5951 2018-01-02 17:09:08 thanx haejin we really need this correction
5952 2018-01-02 17:09:07 Love your tweets.  You're a TA guru
5953 2018-01-02 17:08:59 The obvious elephant in the room being the absolutely ridiculous bubble in bonds... The crypto bubble is nothing compared to that.
5954 2018-01-02 17:08:58 Still loving $MUE in 2018.
5955 2018-01-02 17:08:57 Interview up and comers in the space.  How about us @cryptomania_
5956 2018-01-02 17:08:56 Coinbase  or  partnership with newyork  top3 medie will be announced.   Brave have  millionS users . its means a lot for crypto. im in it at 0.17 . first target $1-1.5.   $5
5957 2018-01-02 17:08:55 Help !:
ハードウォレットのTrezorやLedgerの取引履歴には，コメント欄が見つかりません。どのような取引だったのかメモできないので困ります。
何とか簡単にメモを書けるようにできないものでしょうか。
5958 2018-01-02 17:08:53 Thanks for taking my ask serious! Awesome @Haejin_Crypto !
5959 2018-01-02 17:08:53 definitely singapore..we could chat about crypto over prata
5960 2018-01-02 17:08:48 Yes it will be reborn next month don't worry..
5961 2018-01-02 17:08:46 Then they went to the next penny crypto with more volume.. $TRX but not to mention, $XVG still holds the substantial volume and hodlers
5962 2018-01-02 17:08:43 It's open source now... As of December 31st

5964 2018-01-02 17:08:32 I never liked ripple, I knew ripple as just a mere crypto. Thanks to @haydentiff, she made me research more about it and I like what they’re doing. I invested and I’m making 300% pure profit on it. I think I’m gonna hodl till Jesus comes. LOL @Ripple @haydentiff @coinbase
5965 2018-01-02 17:08:26 Thank u so much all the time

5990 2018-01-02 17:06:06 Cryptocurrencies feel like the dot com bubble- people investing not based on research, but for fear of missing the gold rush. Which, of course, was/is more a statement on investor mentality than the long-term viability of the Internet/Crypto.

6011 2018-01-02 17:04:53 I'd go further - frequent regime shifts in crypto mean that even with a large statistically valid dataset, we need to be very skeptical that the future will resemble the past.
6012 2018-01-02 17:04:36 Stop shortening cryptocurrency to “crypto”? “crypto” == cryptography. You don’t have a fucking hardware cryptography wallet to store all your AES’s and HMAC’s. You can’t fucking buy blowfish or sell bcrypt. Rant over.
6013 2018-01-02 17:04:36 Una pregunta, las criptos las enseñas desde una perspectiva de analizar proyectos long term o más TA para trades cortos?
6014 2018-01-02 17:04:24 But overall, crypto markets are the new "Global" pink sheets... Lots of noise, deception & hype everywhere.

6034 2018-01-02 17:03:07 Love the charts. Will learn allot from you.
6035 2018-01-02 17:03:07 More haters will be there when others are growing, when #bitcoin was growing people started to tell bubble will burst but it crossed 19k$ as well. History gonna repeat with #XVG wait for it.. patience is the key in crypto #WraithProtocol
6036 2018-01-02 17:03:06 A few days in crypto can feel like forever. This is a good reminder that #ZCL is a waiting game..
6037 2018-01-02 17:03:01 We also have to make sure when purchasing a hardware wallet that it supports whichever crypto we are wanting to secure. The most popular ones seem to be supported by Ledger.
6038 2018-01-02 17:02:48 In which case, there’s your financial instability right there.  No need for crypto, you’re already wearing it.
6039 2018-01-02 17:02:48 Of those listed, Ethereum and Litecoin will most likely do best. BTC will increase, but modestly compared to 2017, because other/better crypto steals its marketshare.
6040 2018-01-02 17:02:44 ofc. But to suggest that banks don’t know how to manage exposure to risks (eg crypto) is to suggest banks don’t know how to do banking.

6059 2018-01-02 17:01:41 I'm not that good about crypto currency. But If I remember right, I heard bitcoin crashed just recently.
6060 2018-01-02 17:01:35 Do you have an example of why his TA is poor? Just curious.

6062 2018-01-02 17:01:23 Nation-states have no incentive to create cryptocurrencies... until crypto starts eating their market share. 

Each time a national cryptocurrency is created, we'll know that state is losing its power. Venezuela will be the first of many.
6063 2018-01-02 17:01:23 If you're new to $crypto, don't follow the money you will get burnt. Do some research my gs, it's alright to want to make some money just don't let greed get the better of you!

6075 2018-01-02 17:00:35 Stock market? Has volume, it's likely all that money corporations WOULDN'T bring back. Bitcoin isn't the same crypto currency it was in 2014. Esp if people R borrowing 2 invest, kiss it bah bye. Today's Bitcoin has been corrupted by very thing that we bailed out. Think about it.
6076 2018-01-02 17:00:33 В ЕС показаны зарплаты до уплаты налогов, реально люди получают намного меньше. К тому же надо сравнивать не просто зарплаты, а ВВП по паритету покупательной способности.

How many people handle the minable currency in a wrong way?
(Store it on online wallets / give it to mining farms)
50%, 70% >90% ?

I think >90%

6100 2018-01-02 16:59:06 What would be the best investment to get into right now that is ground up (newest coin - cheapest entry)
6101 2018-01-02 16:59:04 生き物怖いですねw
僕もツイートしようかと思ったとこでしたw

出金は、 少し買った $link をMercatoxから送金して問題なく送れました。あとはxrbとkinを買って放置してるだけなので、全額出金とかは実験したことないです。

出金時、2FAがコピペだとなぜかうまくいかなくなるので手打ち推奨。
6102 2018-01-02 16:59:03 only 6 people?  why?
6103 2018-01-02 16:58:46 [Crypto] Le #TRX est bien parti pour nous faire une #xrp, plutôt cool pour ce projet intéressant !

僕はブログとかだから良いけど、仮想通貨はダイレクトにお金絡むからヤバい人比率も高そう
6106 2018-01-02 16:58:30 And yet some Twitter Crypto folks are begging for “tips” made on winning calls. 

A monkey could throw 3 darts at a list of Altcoins and be in profit on them all atm..

6111 2018-01-02 16:58:14 Someone start a $cpa ICO for a coin who’s utility is doing crypto taxes for US residents, please <3
6112 2018-01-02 16:58:13 I am predicting at least one 10 billion+ crypto will crash before $BTC gets above 20k.
6113 2018-01-02 16:58:04 Oh it definitely does. I'm just trusting the guy behind the project. All this crypto shit is a risk
6114 2018-01-02 16:57:56 I have never witnessed this kind of shameless greed and animosity towards a working and improving product. This has been completely unprecedented and embarrassing. As a novice(not noob anymore) I hope it does not set the standard for Crypto moving forward.  Best of luck $xvg
6115 2018-01-02 16:57:54 If anyone's into cryptocurrency, what crypto wallet do you use, if at all
6116 2018-01-02 16:57:47 I wouldn't suggest paying through CC always. Just pay once for BTC, then buy crypto with crypto, else the income tax dept, bank will be aware of all your foreign purchases.
6117 2018-01-02 16:57:42 なんか起きてるんです？(ござると賃貸とネコニーさんくらいしかいない)

6120 2018-01-02 16:57:17 年明け早々、久々にポートフォリオ組みなおしてみたぉ。１０％を短期トレード用（草むしり用）、３０％をＩＣＯ枠に移動。残りを中長期ガチホスタイルに変更しましたぉ。

6122 2018-01-02 16:57:09 I'd like to thank the coworker that told me about #Bitcoin and @Coinbase in June 2017. It's by far the best financial advice ever given to me.  Also, thanks #cryptotwitter for helping me 7x my investment, especially:

6126 2018-01-02 16:56:45 You don't think those conglomerate social media services will adapt instead of be replaced?? I think if crypto keeps going it would be easier for YouTube to use reddcoin then have a new "YouTube" emerge and take over. YouTube has made people millionaires

6128 2018-01-02 16:56:40 Thank you for telling me about the binance app. I got a ton of TRX at .3 woke up smiling this morning

6131 2018-01-02 16:56:35 Even given their failure to release wraith in a professional/timely manner? Do you think that scared buyers and holders off? As a holder I’m worried that their reputation is slightly damaged.
6132 2018-01-02 16:56:35 @CryptoChoe thanks for your tweet n tips It's really helped me, but I have a question hope you have the answer as I'm new to crypto and I'm buy through binance. so how I can withdraw $$ form binance? you have change into other crypto currencies in binance :/
6133 2018-01-02 16:56:32 What websites do you use to perform a scan? Most of the marketplace sites don't have all of the bells and whistles to perform analyses
6134 2018-01-02 16:56:30 Nope..  Wrong it is the door to RFID and is the beast.  Read revelation chapter 13 = verses 13 through 18

6137 2018-01-02 16:56:23 Do you thunk we're reaching the euphoria point in the crypto ecosystem or we have still much to go ?
6138 2018-01-02 16:56:21 Interested to know how many ppl think that the entire #crypto thing is a bubble and why
6139 2018-01-02 16:56:21 I personally analysis when ever u tweet hold hold hold #xvg price going to down not to t moon. Bcz of shit publicity and to much tweets many people n my self we loss thousand of usd, when it's will go to the moon ? Today is super moon why don't xvg visit tonight ?
6140 2018-01-02 16:56:18 This would be a disaster for the Crypto space in totality.  We need BTC to remain the reserve currency.
6141 2018-01-02 16:56:08 Momento de Compra para #XVG $xvg Zona de sobreventa en 4h, 66h y 12 h. Rebotando ahora mismo. A por el 100%!!!! #Crypto
6142 2018-01-02 16:56:03 I have the same feeling and game plan.

6146 2018-01-02 16:56:02 Bitcoin - maybe a bubble atm. Lets be honest, it is old and slow, highly taxed. But there are so many great and innovative projects in the crypto space, deserving to be valued. I want to see 2018 as the year of next generation alts. And of course, lets hope for less scams.

6149 2018-01-02 16:55:47 That Dragon ICO report you put out in October. Damn. I owe you guys a drink one day. Thanks Birch!  Also gathering cash to join your Discord.
6150 2018-01-02 16:55:44 Fuck you guys and your fake twitter account probably xvg whale or mcafees paid nerd.   Never fuck over XVG FAM cause we will fuckin leave yall.   Peace watch Tron rise now
6151 2018-01-02 16:55:35 The guys with the big bags tell you fools to hold while its crashing and so many other alot coins are giving double digit returns. Dumped $xvg for $trx when it was at 3 cents. Already made as much today as if i waited for $xvg to hit 50 cents after the supposed drop.
6152 2018-01-02 16:55:24 Nope. But i did report the site to godaddy.
But the address is still recieving crypto.
6153 2018-01-02 16:55:22 I dont think the eventual ATH has really been publicly conceived.  We are looking at trillions of dollars globally and crypto hasnt even hit 1T collectively.  ATH is pretty far away.
6154 2018-01-02 16:55:18 I’m very bullish on Veritaseum. @ReggieMiddleton is one of the top innovators in crypto, beta out this month. I think it’ll hit $5k EOY 2018
6155 2018-01-02 16:55:15 I've been out of the blockchain/crypto loop for a solid 2 weeks (which feels like a decade given the pace at which that world moves). Time to play catch-up!
6156 2018-01-02 16:55:14 His TA is poor and manipulated but it works due to the hype and FOMO of all his followers. 
Disgusting to mislead the unexperienced traders like that and meanwhile playing Mr Nice Guy

Dernière chose, le trading compote un gros risque, n'y mettez pas l'argent de votre loyer-courses !
6161 2018-01-02 16:54:22 Thanks. Agreed, ironically, Bitcoin's first-generation distributed ledger technology limitations arguably make it attractive as a store of value versus other crypto-commodities. Still it is clear we are in an early phase  - more to come! : )
6162 2018-01-02 16:54:20 I really like $NAV. Mobile wallet with optional privacy and Anonymous dApps and polymorph upcoming! #navcoin 
6163 2018-01-02 16:54:16 There were no lies in #xvg, can you specify any lie they told?? yeah they missed deadline & if u r IT guy you would know how hard it is to complete in deadline. They would have released bugged wallet in order to meet their deadline, but they did not. Cause they care about us.
6164 2018-01-02 16:54:12 I hope not David but you have to do what makes you happy. Crypto aside, I think you are entertaining...
6165 2018-01-02 16:54:00 You dont have to believe in the long term of crypto, but you should be trading them.  So much opportunity out there.  Similar to late 90s in tech stocks with much less regulation.  You know better than anyone, trading and investing are two different things.
6166 2018-01-02 16:53:57 Exactly. The drama also indicates the amount of new blood in crypto.
Name me a coin and I'll find you drama/FUD that was going on with it. The longer you're around, the more you get used to it.
6167 2018-01-02 16:53:50 I dont think bitcoin adheres to the same rule set as other cryptos. I think btc will forever be the dinosaur of cryptocurrencies. Ether and ltc will come and go but I think btc is here to stay.
6168 2018-01-02 16:53:48 $250-$500 per $OMG.
6169 2018-01-02 16:53:42 Well, when you say 'shit' with capslock on all the time I guess that means you must be totally right.

6177 2018-01-02 16:53:00 Why do you say it's the future?  Were we not supposed to be in a major upswing the last few days over the release of #WraithProtocol?  Why has that not happened?  In fact, it's retreated!  Go?!?  It's trending down!   #xvg #fail
6178 2018-01-02 16:52:59 Amazingly great call on TRX - thank you for that! Been buying more LTC-I believe in the fundamental benefits of this coin and plan to hold. Set up my web business to take crypto, and with $50 avg ticket, many more customers using LTC than BTC.
6179 2018-01-02 16:52:49 It seems similar thing is happening in India. Leading crypto exchanges Koinex and Coindelta have stopped accepting fund via NEFT /IMPS for last 3-4 days . It looks to me both banks and exchanges want to keep it under wrap. And it really got unnoticed on global level.

6186 2018-01-02 16:52:19 i love to get crypto
6187 2018-01-02 16:52:17 Top 10 in Market Cap. There's already beginning to be a large community adoption, and it will only grow as more and more rumors of regulation hit the market. Privacy Coins are the best place to go to if you want true decentralization, and that's what crypto is about.
6188 2018-01-02 16:52:13 I’ve invested in $mint ... energy efficient coin .. 100% gains in less then 24 hours also which is nice! 
6189 2018-01-02 16:52:10 OMG美味しい？
6190 2018-01-02 16:52:04 PKI is an industry standard. I think it's well known the crypto world needs some mature standards to help the ecosystem grow. Still seems like you're avoiding answering what other solutions to help end user experience. Would really like to know.
6191 2018-01-02 16:52:03 2018 is going to be a roller-coaster for those of us working on blockchain-related projects which aren't specifically crypto-currency. How will the crypto bubble and ICO implosion (PREDICTIONS) affect wider perception of blockchain as a general-purpose technology?
6192 2018-01-02 16:52:02 Is #TRX $TRX going to overtake #XRP $XRP?

6195 2018-01-02 16:51:56 When is this going to be fixed. I have a lot of money in bittrex on ada and can't touch it. This is why some people are scared of crypto. It's one thing losing money because you made a bad decision on a coin but not because bit tricks or cardano messed up.

6201 2018-01-02 16:51:33 OK. Please explain how price is "Backing this up", it's literally up 2500% since last month.  $XVG and all crypto is volatile stop focusing on USD price.  I haven't lost trust. You don't want to release something full of bugs even if you give a deadline, unless you're Apple :)
6202 2018-01-02 16:51:30 Top crypto!
6203 2018-01-02 16:51:24 Happy New Year to you! Your public interviews are a great service to the crypto market in general. Thanks again.
6204 2018-01-02 16:51:24 With a business guy like Trump in office it's a wonder that they have been so quiet about crypto.  Worries me about the mid-term outlook for 99% of the market.
6205 2018-01-02 16:51:22 10? haha! you forgot another 0...

6222 2018-01-02 16:50:13 I wish I knew! I feel like it only makes BTC more vulnerable by denying this as a possible attack vector. A successful attack would destabilize the entire crypto economy.
6223 2018-01-02 16:50:12 Tell us how you really feel
6224 2018-01-02 16:50:00 We're also gonna hit 1000 sat today easily on #XVG 
6225 2018-01-02 16:49:57 I said this on another thread, but I just can't seem to sell yet. I have a feeling it's going to get ludicrous, then move a bunch to BTC, then BTC rips.
6226 2018-01-02 16:49:54 I could probably make myself available.  Just saying. 
Bonus: I'll implement crypto fiat on the side!

6236 2018-01-02 16:49:25 Here’s the thing Jesse... this crypto market spans the globe.. it moves at lightening speed and needs a trigger to collapse. 2008 style market correction or Mt Gox 2.0... short of that, you will see continued barista money flow into it
6237 2018-01-02 16:49:21 I'm not sure.  On Fri. when $WATT dumped someone on twitter mentioned an insider in $RIOT dumped alot of shares.  If bitcoin and that other crypto junk jumps up again it could get more hype.
6238 2018-01-02 16:49:21 @VeritiumMining  is crypto miners that have come together to mine on a large scale basis. Due to being large scale crypto mining is highly profitable compared with self mining.
#Veritium #SustainableCryptoMining
6239 2018-01-02 16:49:21 But at the same time do I want it to eclipse bitcoin in market cap? Fuck no anything other than ripple, even $BCH would be better
6240 2018-01-02 16:49:20 What’s the moral of the story? If u r old , you get tired early ?  I can relate
6241 2018-01-02 16:49:18 Everyone getting into #crypto is getting less and less sleep while making more and more money. Or am I the only one who can't sleep well anymore, so excited. #cryptocurrencies #cryptocurrency
6242 2018-01-02 16:49:15 I bet they'd happily take large donations in crypto...
6243 2018-01-02 16:49:14 Really liked the crypto and games PUBG edition yesterday. Had never heard of that game but it was fun watching :-)
6244 2018-01-02 16:49:10 Over 5000% increase... yet I’m only seeing one coin go above 11x... did you add your percentages up??
6245 2018-01-02 16:49:07 I helped a good 700 ppl invest in crypto in the past 7 months !
6246 2018-01-02 16:48:57 Yup got it Crypto Rand.:)
6247 2018-01-02 16:48:55 #trx again is going up! #HODL !!! :D
6248 2018-01-02 16:48:45 Forget all the hype. Banks are gonna evolve mostly by themselves...
6249 2018-01-02 16:48:42 1/4の銀行入金の解禁と同時に買いが増えるのは間違いないので、CC銘柄の何を買っとくべきか考え中
6250 2018-01-02 16:48:41 Because of the dogma that bitcoin is King. It is about the tech, it is about the underlying technology. If it is gonna be overthrown people wouldn’t be mad if it was a coin like $xmr or $xlm but it’s centralized garbage. I personally invested in ripple at $.22 I see their case.
6251 2018-01-02 16:48:41 I am happy to be wrong. It happens often! But my view on crypto at the moment is that it's in the mania phase, best exemplified by short-term traders hoping to get lucky, not to improve the world around them.
6252 2018-01-02 16:48:36 @londonbitforum Currently in the preproduction and planning stages of a documentary about bitcoin and crypto - Looking for folk in the know to interview. Any suggestions please?
6253 2018-01-02 16:48:32 Bank one you get you monies in 3-5 days and pay large fees & bank 2 you get your monies in 4-7 seconds and pay very little fees. which one will you use?

6257 2018-01-02 16:48:16 Looking back on people's predictions for tech in 2017.

Crypto/blockchain is rarely mentioned as being the big deal it has become.

We suck at predicting the future.

6268 2018-01-02 16:47:21 So if I am a country and I make a failed crypto what exactly happens if it fails?  Who becomes accountable?  Since it's all encrypted is that info available?  This is going hard and fast and the world will be a different place soon enough.

6271 2018-01-02 16:47:07 RT @WesleyCooperTLS: It's funny. Everyone on Twitter and IG who "trades" crypto claims to be an expert.

6272 2018-01-02 16:47:07 RT @AlbertAmpere: Would it be crazy to sell all my Ripple ( #XRP ) and move it all into Tronix ( #TRX )? Thoughts? #Crypto #BTC #ETH #TRON #Ripple
6273 2018-01-02 16:46:49 sure, none of them every give fiat back to people, you can only deposit fiat and buy crypto... you ain't getting fiat money out.
6274 2018-01-02 16:46:41 Our subscribers have had the opportunity to profit over 170% on $TRX & almost 100% on $GEO so far! Our $LUN trade is moving well, as are our $XZC & $NEO trades. $AION is up 50%, we made 50% on $ARN, and $ICX & $GAS are up 30% or more each! #cryptocurrencies $crypto #bitcoin $btc
6275 2018-01-02 16:46:40 Do some early crypto trading this morning and start the day!
6276 2018-01-02 16:46:40 I think it's good that people bring up both the history and tech. It's kind of hard to follow everything tho, I try to read all the technically stuff usually, because the history can be very complicated and full of different views. Someone should write The Crypto Saga
6277 2018-01-02 16:46:35 ... Why the hell did you report this as a total increase and not an average increase?
6278 2018-01-02 16:46:27 "the WHO has decided that “gaming disorder” AKA video game addiction will be recognized as a mental health disorder in 2018. And yet everyone’s crypto obsession is still perfectly acceptable." @Hustle_Says

6280 2018-01-02 16:46:00 good point, thank you. in the end it could lead to people actually staying more in crypto, but who knows, there are really too many alts for ordinary people

6293 2018-01-02 16:45:21 I invested in some new crypto currencies on Friday before I left work. I just checked my account, I’m up $500 in 3 days.
6294 2018-01-02 16:45:13 年末年始は概ね順調。
#TRX, #VEN, #NAGA, #XSH は順調に伸びている。少額の #ADA, #LEND, #SNT も良好。あとは、#BCH,#XVG が頑張ってくれれば。。

6298 2018-01-02 16:44:45 Namaste Crypto Yogi. Many many happy returns of the day!!!
6299 2018-01-02 16:44:40 Lack of liquidity kills; If banks have exposed themselves to the clearing, settlement, and margining risks of #crypto then how can we tell what the risk is, and more importantly, how can they? Remember Barings?
6300 2018-01-02 16:44:36 Shoutout to @vauntpoom for giving me the crypto knowledge... Homie has doubled my money already.
6301 2018-01-02 16:44:36 Revolut said that their next step is to allow transfers in/out of Revolut directly in crypto. As I give them the benefit of the doubt, lower fees does matter
6302 2018-01-02 16:44:36 Interesting, I also am noticing a lot of companies creating their own crypto currency to help in fundraising new projects.
6303 2018-01-02 16:44:34 新参すぎてリップル8円事件を知らない
6304 2018-01-02 16:44:33 Yes!  was envisioning someone doing crypto dogs and so happy it was TRON!!
6305 2018-01-02 16:44:30 I was wondering what kind of idiots on twitter actually follow these fake accounts. Found one @Rhapsodie2017 You probably thought she was real huh? lol. Thanks @crypto976
6306 2018-01-02 16:44:30 I consider bitcoin and crypto currency/blockchain concept very progressive. My point was we are still lacking behind on futuristic things and we are stuck on regressive things like caste system. And my point to elon musk mars thing was that we as an individual work towards future

6310 2018-01-02 16:43:54 I made a rookie mistake some weeks ago...

6312 2018-01-02 16:43:48 We came across some problems the last moments while testing. Justin and the dev team had to work really hard to fix the problems and release wraith. At that moment he could better code than talk. Because the release talks for itself.

6320 2018-01-02 16:42:58 Not sure why people would ever call #bitcoin a joke or "no good"! Have you read the white paper or the Satoshi emails? It started everything! In the emerging crypto economy, there will be token winners and losers but #bitcoin will never be a loser!

6329 2018-01-02 16:42:23 exactly , main point of crypto is to give power to the people with decentralization and people who see that in XRP are totally uneducated about that. Guess who owns most of it's supply....They can manipulate with it's price as they wish.
6330 2018-01-02 16:42:12 We now have at least one report that the @CoinExchangeio issue was a false alarm. Standby until we can confirm and do not withdraw. This may be due to system upgrades rather than any hack. cc @Crypto_Brahma
6331 2018-01-02 16:41:56 Oh I'm an idiot? No wonder xvg is shit. Wannabe crypto experts like you who don't want to take the time to educate and spread awareness. You'd rather bash anyone who doesn't dick ride. I'm a grown man so I'll say the bad words your whore mom won't let you say. Fuck you and xvg
6332 2018-01-02 16:41:55 Ah shit man.... Yeah crypto markets are sort of counterintuitive, the hype is always great, but the price is 90% of the time already calculated in the hype itself. When the news comes out, a selloff happens. No fireworks, no new highs... But when you're caught in the hype

6353 2018-01-02 16:40:27 Just because you made some profit in a centralized trade doesn't mean you gave up the decentralized dream. I thought Bitcoin was more than just the price, why are you worried now that it may lose its #1 rank in market cap to centralized options? It's all about the tech right?

6356 2018-01-02 16:40:15 As said before, the banks are using Ripple technology.. the actual XRP tokens aren't even necessary for this tech to function.

1シェアー当たりの採掘量は，これまで一定値で近似できましたが，9月15日から減って来ています。現在は以前の半分ぐらいになっていますので，採掘量の変動を考慮した形に改良する必要があります。
増加率は下がりますが，指数関数的に増える点は変わりません。

6375 2018-01-02 16:38:32 Gone from $200 investment in #crypto on 12/18/2017 to $575 as of this morning, Started with a small investment to feel it all out. I couldn't be more pleased with the way it is going.  #InTheGreen #makemoney #CND #POE #IOTA #LEND #TNB #WABI #OST #ENJ
6376 2018-01-02 16:38:30 the big crypto use case that no one talks about is that it is a hedge against the entire existing financial system
6377 2018-01-02 16:38:30 In my feed (on LinkedIn), it’s the same guys who post all day and night about growth hacking  and crypto stuff. Just ”a little” annoying.. but guess ”it works” as far as the post engagement goes 
6378 2018-01-02 16:38:29 You break rule 1 of crypto and thats do not get attached to your bags
6379 2018-01-02 16:38:28 Everyone is talking about crypto. It’s not even bonus or tax refund season. Black swan event that would hurt alts now is a Binance or bittrex hack.
6380 2018-01-02 16:38:18 @CoinbaseSupport Have sold my crypto currencies and am trying to withdraw my funds from @coinbase into my UK bank account. Have done the SEPA payment to verify my account but now no progress. UK-based support needed. Please advise ASAP.

6382 2018-01-02 16:38:15 This is crypto. $5,000 $ZCL/$BTCP is realistic. Especially by EOY 2018.
6383 2018-01-02 16:38:15 As crazy as this sounds, and I'm STILL a big fan of taking profits ... I don't see selling any coin I own anywhere < +300% in 2018. Most I won't take less than + 500%.  Some, +1000%.
6384 2018-01-02 16:38:10 Just HODL up everything as far as possible
6385 2018-01-02 16:38:09 Really hating crypto minimum payment thresholds. You shouldn't say a coin is for casuals if you can't actually touch any of your mined coins for over a month.
6386 2018-01-02 16:38:07 Biggest dilemma is wether to invest in crypto or stocks

6389 2018-01-02 16:38:04 Oh I understand the argument. My position is that it isn't sound because it hasn't worked. It didn't work between Suzuki and Rushton years ago and it doesn't work now. I'm all for diversity of tactics, though.
6390 2018-01-02 16:38:03 They had to shut down @XVGWhale. How on earth could they let him be an unofficial spokesman. This kid destroyed more than we all can imagine. PR terrible and lots of angry people by lack of comms and again not keeping promises. Killing for business.

6396 2018-01-02 16:37:37 sad reflection of the state of crypto. so many new people into the space that were successfully influenced by propaganda. 

Vorhees created the first "killer app" ever, then went on to create 2 more successful products. But "muh no2x" has made people think he's evil. just sad.

6414 2018-01-02 16:36:25 There is no bitcoin brand. It's open source and bitcoin is just another name for crypto currency. Bit refers to digital and coin refers to currency. Satoshi just used the name because it did not exist at that time. He invented the engine, not the steam engine or the gas engine.
6415 2018-01-02 16:36:10 haha... pathetic, no I do... but I believe in the blockchain technology, not making quick bucks for the sake of the goverment.. do you know what they do when you buy your SHIT ripple with BTC/ETC?

6425 2018-01-02 16:35:46 Agree with @alanjsmith I'm a big fan of blockchain and crypto sector but it isn't really investing and most people should wait until the market has developed and stabilised or until they fully understand the tech and have used it

6443 2018-01-02 16:34:23 I moved money to crypto in 2017 due to US economic policy failures. This year dereg = boom, but U.S. is 2yrs away from stock market crash and total meltdown. Mathmatical Ecomonic fact.

6457 2018-01-02 16:33:47 Exactly. They gave a deadline they couldn't stick to. They rushed to release a wallet without it's core feature present. They didn't communicate with the community. An now the current price is reflecting that. Major investors aren't going to invest in fairy tales.

6496 2018-01-02 16:31:51 The absurd amount of concentration is what will eventually kill thoses 'currencies'. If I invent a crypto now, create 100 billion 'units' to myself and then convince someone to buy one unit at 1 dollar -am I suddenly the world's richest person?
6497 2018-01-02 16:31:49 1/2 Bitcoiners don't understand that Etheruem is just a baseline blockchain to build stuff on top of it. That stuff does not have to be money. Not every crypto has to be a currency. If Bitcoiners would understand this they would not be so hostile.

6513 2018-01-02 16:30:53 Agreed. The tor “toggle” integration was the main selling point of Wraith.

6531 2018-01-02 16:29:28 I seen a big crypto investors blockfolio. It was worth $2 million and he only had 3 bitcoin. Had me wanting to sell all my btc and go all altcoins.

6534 2018-01-02 16:29:14 Yeah and then they make a transaction and they will all know that Bitcoin is really expensive to use. And then it they REALLY need crypto they will probably find out about the other ones. Unless they go to /r/bitcoin and then they will wonder why everybody is so hostile.

6541 2018-01-02 16:28:48 Ok, it’s been 5 minutes and I’ve reached my limit with James. Are you on the revised list yet?? I did not really think this protest through fully.
6542 2018-01-02 16:28:43 Muy buen artículo, me ha gustado. El que no vea el valor de esto es que no ha leido lo suficiente sobre #blockchaintechnology
6543 2018-01-02 16:28:42 At that marketcap? Every other crypto with similar tech in whitepaper is 3x that. Shift actually has a product... We should be at least 4X what we are right now just to prevent people buying up delegate nodes for #badthings.
6544 2018-01-02 16:28:41 @paullewismoney as we may well be in a crypto tulip bubble, I fear many will suffer catastrophic losses due to over leverage, still permitted by fca/esma. Could you please RT my pinned tweet? It happened to me!
6545 2018-01-02 16:28:38 the juxtaposition of nonstop crypto babble from my brother with my parents mindbogglingly plodding rural internet were something else

6551 2018-01-02 16:28:14 By conceding to centralized authorities. Like I said, it’s backwards thinking.
6552 2018-01-02 16:28:10 Like Negastar Corporation is kidnapping people to turn their brains into crypto currency processors or something…
6553 2018-01-02 16:28:09 Being in crypto is like living in a village next to an active volcano.... you never know when it’s going to wake up...just that it’s always a possibility

6559 2018-01-02 16:27:48 Well sure, but at the same time conceding to centralized entities would just be completely backwards in the fight for decentralization. I’m not insinuation decentralization or blockchain/Crypto all together don’t have severe growing pains but it’s naive to think they’ll be solved
6560 2018-01-02 16:27:45 Because of the idiots like so called Wales! !

6566 2018-01-02 16:27:12 Until verge actually integrates TOR into the core wallet and there's proof it can obfuscate IPs. Then at the moment wraith is nothing new. Stealth addresses are nothing new, the new UI isn't all that aesthetically pleasing. So why are people going to invest....
6567 2018-01-02 16:27:02 Haha! Crypto Gang.
6568 2018-01-02 16:27:00 So firing up a smart contract in crypto to get the nagger to be a man scares the poo talker?

6599 2018-01-02 16:25:00 In retrospect, it was only a matter of time until the crypto space started using the world's oldest scheme to make money. Religion. I have faith...that it will pump...and dump

6621 2018-01-02 16:23:45 I like Tron because I can actually see it being used in the future. It's already adopted and is already in use. More than what 90% of other crypto's can say. $1 this year easy.

6692 2018-01-02 16:19:53 $TRX today we all learned a very valuable lesson in crypto. HODL or miss out, is that simple. My friend had 60k coins and sold at 0.03 when justin went live because he thought the live stream was unprofessional, i thought it was the best way to show the transparency of a company.

6792 2018-01-02 16:14:02 there are also quite a few of those CVEs that come from linux-only features. I remember a ref-count issue with the crypto-ring in kernel.

6954 2018-01-02 16:05:32 I don’t think there is anything public yet. I still need to track down their official master branch on GitHub. But I doubt it will have anything until they have a meaningful launch. Then it should give us some more info to dig through.

6962 2018-01-02 16:04:41 I have to disagree, I got in early but still sold nothing because I know this technology had the potential take over crypto, used in real life
6963 2018-01-02 16:04:40 @S0rcererSupreme what is your #1 crypto on bittrex ?
6964 2018-01-02 16:04:35 You could use asymmetric crypto and not have to distribute the key to all devices (assuming more than 1 device needs it), but it'll be slower
6965 2018-01-02 16:04:34 So you sheep will go to a coin that has good marketing but not one with proven tech that works? No wonder there are so many scams in crypto. You all like your news spoon fed, even if it comes sprinkled with lies throughout. $XVG
6966 2018-01-02 16:04:33 I think the real key to crypto profits is buying a fintech. Finding the trading platform that’s gonna go public
6967 2018-01-02 16:04:27 Step 1 - Download wallet > open wallet > close wallet
Step 2 - Download blockchain
Step 3 - Unpack block chain into, 'VERGE' folder located in %appdata%. Can't see those folders. check show hidden files in file settings.
Step 4 - Re-open wallet and wait patiently for upto 30mins

6990 2018-01-02 16:03:38 I recently told a friend to invest into crypto, I told him put in what he can afford to lose. He ignored that, pulled his entire stock profile and put it into crypto, his 8% AVG portfolio has now made 37% within a few days, my friend is a very happy man. But be careful people!

7020 2018-01-02 16:01:19 How to make money trading crypto right now. 
1) Look for breakout setups on med-high cap alts (top 30)
2) Enter on breakout
3) Set mental stop (alert)
4) Set limit sells at fib targets.
5) Profit (or lose a small amount vs the big reward)

7026 2018-01-02 16:00:53 Cool. No I haven’t tried programming blockchain yet. I know DragonChain will be developer friendly in C#/Go/Python/NodeJS. Kind of interested to start learning. I’ve been crushing the net since 1999 so I thought programming blockchain might be an amazing progression.

7032 2018-01-02 16:00:41 Hi Christine - I wouldn’t class that as investing - it’s speculating & we tend to avoid that. Whereas there’s no doubt that the underlying block chain technology will have a big impact, guessing which of the thousands of crypto currencies will succeed is not a worthwhile pursuit

15830satで0.144btc購入
7101 2018-01-02 15:56:44 it will go up dont worry. give them a week for them to officially announce wraith and it will go up. it only takes minutes for a coin to go up or down . dont panic sell .
7102 2018-01-02 15:56:44 Btc can be tracked but it takes great resources to track there is ways of getting around tracking but tracked or not the transaction can not be stopped that’s what gives a crypto value
7103 2018-01-02 15:56:43 However, countmycrypto is a Sinatra app - so definitely using Ruby for $crypto purposes, if not actually blockchain 
7104 2018-01-02 15:56:42 Thank you  @TheGoffin

7117 2018-01-02 15:55:57 正しいことを伝える時は正しい方法でなくてはならない。正しいことを間違った方法で正そうとし、正義感に高揚する人間がイジメも戦争も起こし、そのことに気づかない。
7118 2018-01-02 15:55:51 I've taken it since 5 cents and will continue taking it to 5 dollars.
7119 2018-01-02 15:55:49 Not with Ruby unfortunately... looked at ethereum.rb but it doesn't seem very actively maintained, so have been messing around with JS instead. You?

7122 2018-01-02 15:55:27 Currently there are 2,617,428 $XCP it is not minable, so there will be no more coins than that. But do not forget that everytime a new asset is created XCP coins are burn. So there will always be less XCP!

7129 2018-01-02 15:54:46 this story dropping the same day the goatse site turned into a crypto currency site is the jump cut from 2001
7130 2018-01-02 15:54:43 What makes you think bitcoin won't adopt those features and render other coins mere testnets? You know it's a two way road.
7131 2018-01-02 15:54:37 For the last 2days I've been studying Crypto. I fell off for a good 2weeks
7132 2018-01-02 15:54:37 Done!!
7133 2018-01-02 15:54:36 Hi @Haejin_Crypto really interesting to see if this is still going to be 70 cts after all the bad publicity? For me this feels like a nice testcase to see if, like you say, the numbers decide the news, or vice versa:)
7134 2018-01-02 15:54:31 $TRX.X this is the cheapest crypto very attractive at this price apparently.
7135 2018-01-02 15:54:26 great long term project too. one of my fav bags

7156 2018-01-02 15:53:15 Why are there so many trolls on Twitter? Seriously if you don't believe in something or don't like it, doesn't mean you have to hate it and the people/organisation/company behind it. Present your view with manners or not at all, its not that hard really. $Btc $alts $crypto
7157 2018-01-02 15:53:14 $ENG Enigma coin has nothing to do with $CLOAK coin. Cloak has an open source technology called Enigma, but has nothing to do with Enigma the crypto coin. Don't get confused, you need to invest in @CloakCoin if you wish to be part of a truly untraceable coin

7158 2018-01-02 15:53:09 Many economists warn: Fiat world will burn out in spectacular crash, just like 2008 (Lehman crisis). Nothing really has changed, banks doing just the same, no stronger control or regulations, global debt still growing.

But good we will have crypto the next time!
7159 2018-01-02 15:53:08 maybe in equities.  not crytpo.  completely not true.  dont let this discourage you if you are new to trading crypto.

7184 2018-01-02 15:51:11 #TRX #Tron #Tronix breaks into top 15 crypto at number 14.

7186 2018-01-02 15:51:10 I am on the same boat. Wired my deposit on dec12, and still with out money. Kraken this is world of crypto, because you are one of the few exchanges in market with one of the slowest services, does this justify your fees rates?
7187 2018-01-02 15:51:09 John Coin of The Week should learn from you how to pump lol

7193 2018-01-02 15:50:58 There is no last place in crypto, in 100 years everyone alive will be considered “early” ;p
7194 2018-01-02 15:50:56 Bore'nero is essentially a one trick pony, which is one step behind verge, once they incorporate tor into the 4.0 core wallet. An rather then be professional, you'd rather spread FUD like a child, because you know bore'nero is nothing special.
7195 2018-01-02 15:50:52 der name ist Crypto Rich
7196 2018-01-02 15:50:51 Extremely true ik for a fact manipulation has occured but it happens in every crypto market you can't assume a coin is shit just from market
7197 2018-01-02 15:50:42 Looks like crypto to crypto transactions will now be taxable under the new tax bill.
7198 2018-01-02 15:50:36 Feeling sorry for you Bro! Should have brought #trx #tron

7202 2018-01-02 15:50:14 Yeah is pretty ridiculous to see some new thing that most people in this space have not heard of, just blow up to multi billions out of nowhere(Cardano). Really hoping XMR rides back to top 10 at least, top 5 in my dreams. Lots of good things coming for Monero!
7203 2018-01-02 15:50:09 Forex Yes - Crypto No.  I use it for horseracing though.  Degenerate gambler lol.
7204 2018-01-02 15:50:03 Volume is not the same thing as liquidity, I have seen a lot of people conflate the too lately, mostly crypto enthusiasts.
7205 2018-01-02 15:50:00 any word on the official release of wraith?

7225 2018-01-02 15:49:15 India hasnt banned BTC. It is not a legal tender here which means one can not do business against crypto as of now. Indian Govt's stand is neutral so far. They r charging taxes on crypto profits. Which in turn means its not illegal to speculate.

7258 2018-01-02 15:46:59 Crypto is like any investment in the stock market. Just has higher risk which is why people have made loads off it but also lost loads. Don't put any money you can't afford to loose entirely into it. It's essentially gambling.

7306 2018-01-02 15:43:38 This is sort of an unspoken big problem in crypto. There is a ton of volume, but most of the volume is in small increments and to sell a significant amount, you have to do it in batches, and you will inevitably drive the price down yourself.

7392 2018-01-02 15:37:53 Same, I'm not all the way sold but thought it be a good gamble for the price. I honestly think half of crypto is just shooting darts at a board and seeing which one hits.

7406 2018-01-02 15:36:37 XRP is a crypto to buy and hold for years. Stable, excellent use case. Holding for almost a year now and very satisfied (as expected). If you want a chance, buy and hold. #xrpthestandard #xrp #ripple

7436 2018-01-02 15:34:10 Stellar is definitely one of my most favourite  crypto-projects so far. A real use-case, impressive & smart team, security, ease of use, open-source...there is a great future ahead. It is also insanely undervalued at this moment.

7571 2018-01-02 15:26:35 It might be more mixed. I believe when the correction happens it could be large percentage ALTS>BTC>FIAT/ crypto exit that will create huge buying opportunity for BTC as it corrects much less than alts if it does

7670 2018-01-02 15:20:24 The risk seems due to the "wider world" now gambling on crypto, not a problem within crypto itself? Is there a way to keep finance out?

7678 2018-01-02 15:19:56 Crypto checklist

2) Make sure the front end, design and UX is appealing to masses

3) Have someone on your team with EXCELLENT PR skills

4) Never stop working on distribution and partnerships

5) Keep it professional & simple

7697 2018-01-02 15:18:19 It's 2018 already and regulators are still letting this #crypto thing go on. My suspicion is that after Panama paper, etc., and end of offshore, alternative anonymous channels for bribes are necessary and hence hesitation at high levels to terminate this pyramid scheme.
7698 2018-01-02 15:18:17 So, when you say crypto-security, I’m assuming that this refers to an SEC compliant token?

7810 2018-01-02 15:10:12 Yes and No. Assuming the circulating supply of XBY remains the same then your statement is correct. However, in the whitepaper for XBY the devs expect that the collateral required to maintain the network will reduce the circulating supply to +- 100m. (1/2)

7940 2018-01-02 15:00:44 What do you guys think about #steemit ?
Are you using it? do you have account there?

7941 2018-01-02 15:00:39 Well. Never said this wasn’t going to be a giant battle. At some point when your #cartel do not integrate crypto and quit the nationalistic BS. And ppl could not cashout / integrate with Fiat. There is only one option left. They go around.

8002 2018-01-02 14:55:11 Yeah they might be, I never said #xvg is best of all, what Im saying is this idea can surpass #BTC & #xrp. As u already know, wraith has been released & u can see its features which r better than any coin for transactions & no coin can be best for all time.

I wonder how many of them actually know the underlying theory. My guess: very few.

Good product but with bad communication and bad marqueting.

They are bound to suffer harsh blows and be taxed as SCAM if they continue to join exchanges like HitBTC, it's best not to list anything.

8095 2018-01-02 14:48:57 This is one of the problems with crypto enthusiasts. They don't understand what money is in the modern economy actually is. So when they try to improve on it, they start from the wrong position and actually move backwards, not forwards.
8096 2018-01-02 14:48:56 Major S/O to @Socal_crypto and @needacoin...last 4 trades I've copied have gone anywhere from 20% - 115%. You should go give them a follow.

If Bitcoin Cash fails, then Satoshi Nakamoto's invention has failed.

Bitcoin Cash IS the invention that shook the world.

BTC is an experimental fork of Bitcoin that is an ICO for Lightning Network.

8218 2018-01-02 14:40:01 Thank god I got into crypto. This'll make me a millionaire much sooner than I thought. I would be a millionaire without crypto by 25 (in 5 years), but this'll do it by this or next year.

8238 2018-01-02 14:38:36 Ripple(XRP). Estuvo en 0.15. Ahora casi 2.50 y necesita llegar a 3 cifras para tener liquidez funcional para su funcionalidad principal...  Buena crypto para hodl.
8239 2018-01-02 14:38:27 $BTC has been trading sideways for a while and Bitcoin dominance (per @CoinMarketCap) is at what I believe is a record low of 36% of the total market cap.  The last time it was this low was the beginning of a mega bull run and crypto got left behind.  Interesting times!

8306 2018-01-02 14:33:09 Wrong. That is where the money is being made. Those who are married to some kind of bullshit crypto analysis are going to underperform. If u think 2018 has been boring so far, u are in the wrong #Cryptoassets. And you are probably to young to have traded in 2000.
8307 2018-01-02 14:33:09 I thought the “total” value up the top, is the total for the whole portfolio, not “total” per page, if you add all the values that we can see, it adds up to $45,123.84, which means there is no other coins, so no XVG, am I wrong?

8313 2018-01-02 14:32:39 This is phenomenal. Perhaps best item of advice I've ever seen on twitter. Another fascinating writer from the era is Robert DeRopp who wrote a couple of insightful books "The Master Game" being my favorite. Some seek fame &/or fortune. Crypto serves to finance life of discovery.

8336 2018-01-02 14:30:51 Money laundering is taking undisclosed income or capital and "legitimising" it by using friendly businesses to cover the money as profit from "sales".

8369 2018-01-02 14:28:34 My buddy at work made 2,500 in like a week off of crypto currency. Looks like it might be time for me to start looking into this a little more seriously

8371 2018-01-02 14:28:12 It's very well known that all trading of any crypto currency is done with $BTC, so please stop that...
8372 2018-01-02 14:28:08 Lets hope, @FinMinIndia understand the +ve to allowing crypto currency, not allowing it will only ends into New #blackmoney system

8375 2018-01-02 14:27:57 only been investir/trader in crypto since January 2016; however, with crypto being front page news on CNBC,  and mrktcap over $650 billion compared to last January when overall crypto mktcap was around $6-$7 billion, it's an entirely different landscape. Only time will tell.

8390 2018-01-02 14:26:57 While #btc still dominates the crypto space with 37% of assets, it’s down from 90%ish. That means a rotation of cash into alts. This diversification is making this a more matured market. #crypto #2018

Advice: yes with investment in crypto coins or project you can earn money.
HOWEVER you also can loose. It’s almost like #WallStreet 
Loose is not a problem . FUD IS.
8415 2018-01-02 14:25:27 And this dude invests in Crypto, so he's all about alternative options. Like facts and currency. Both kinds of which he supports are fake.

8418 2018-01-02 14:25:17 @Kimaatje You can only sell your ETH for another crypto. You'll need to sell your crypto somewhere else. (I use Bitstamp) if you want to cash out. :)
8419 2018-01-02 14:25:05 Very good point, you mention 100k, you seem very young to have that kinda money to put in crypto, but all the best to you.

8421 2018-01-02 14:25:03 Preparing for @paywithrainbow for 2018, guess fin-tech has to meet with crypto currency to survive and enable a change in the financial direction. We are looking to add Block-chain capabilities with a crypto  wallet. #blockchain

8428 2018-01-02 14:24:40 I’m starting to see the Wall Street crowd set up their excuse for their bubble of a Market by hinting CRYPTO (jealous) could be the spark to set off the bomb for stocks to crash at some point.

$tron is a real currency with real partners, and a solid roadmap for at least 3 years to develop even more. 

Any growth in valuation will be earned and merits what the market suggests.

8676 2018-01-02 14:05:19 Which is why people need to stop trusting these assessments and get aboard while they still can. Crypto is in progress, sometimes harsh progress, but definitely not social recession.

8696 2018-01-02 14:04:07 Imho, this topic depends solely on the crypto you're discussing.  Some cryptos clear in seconds with very small fees, others not so much.  What we do know for sure, $BTC is not fiat (no force required), it is not debt (loaned into existence), and is not centralized.
8697 2018-01-02 14:04:03 As long as it's a sound advice or they had an experience I might not have, why the fuck would I care how long are they in the game? 

I think we gotta start accepting the fact that since so many people are getting into crypto, many of them are most likely smarter than me and you.

8795 2018-01-02 13:56:35 I definitely do... where there is money, corruption will always follow. Especially since boosters/shoe companies are on high alert.. Crypto can become a sort of "black market" for this type of thing. Thoughts?

8802 2018-01-02 13:56:03 Stuff I’m looking forward to in crypto in 2018: 

1. Core blockchains scaling (layer 1 and 2)

2. Credible ICOs shipping live product

3. Products that allow users/developers to opt out of volatility

4. A high quality consumer dapp that’s mobile first (non-Metamask)

8820 2018-01-02 13:54:49 You're missing the point. Bitcoin became desirable because it was decentralised. It couldn't be manipulated by banks and central bankers. It's not inflationary. A crypto run by banks is just an attempt to create a digital currency that masks existing FIAT currencies.

8824 2018-01-02 13:54:42 Crypto currencies are beyond control of governance frameworks and buttons, crack down on free-will trade of crypto is equal to 'a village money lender using punishment threats to hold people from using foreign financial system'.

8834 2018-01-02 13:53:58 #Crypto Advice 25/100- Stay away from PAID signal groups, where you pay for “sure” buy signals.
- If those guys need your money, they are not so successful. Why pay them?
- No one can predict the future, so eventually you will lose both the fee and your hard earned money.

8838 2018-01-02 13:53:44 Crypto-currencies are a scam. They have NO real value. They are not accepted in 99% of barter exchanges. They are NOT private.  Money - cash - has a reliable and accepted value worldwide.

8944 2018-01-02 13:44:29 Presumably if you're running a full node of any crypto, the only activity that leaks private info is creating and broadcasting a tx. Couldn't just that piece be done through Tor or I2P, and just do everything else in the clear?

8955 2018-01-02 13:43:21 I tweeted long time ago that $btc dominance will converge to 5% in long term. If you ask me why. The answer is very long but take as reference my previous estimations which never failed. 
If you need crystal clear answers, Do a favor to yourself and start following me.
8956 2018-01-02 13:43:12 Agree. Also crypto takes it to another level. It's divisible to 0.0000001 and more. While Fiat usually allows 0.01. Nevertheless people compare whole coin to owning one whole stock. "I can't afford to buy Berkshire Hathaway, but I can buy this penny stock"
8957 2018-01-02 13:43:10 @joerogan This video was made by Isaac Haxton's friend & fellow poker pro @DougPolkPoker It's about a modern ponzi scheme in the crypto space. I think it's good if you see it
8958 2018-01-02 13:43:06 Dumb calculation because if he tried to sell 10% of that the market would crash completely. Crypto valuations are stupid due to such low liquidity and easily-panicked markets.

9001 2018-01-02 13:39:03 #2 (unpaid volunteer team) is why $XVG is done. Crypto is a serious game now, with heavy hitters involved. Investors should demand full-time, dedicated, professional teams on the coins they put their money in.

9102 2018-01-02 13:29:34 Net worth of #Ripple CEOs:-

● Chris Larsen (Cofounder & former CEO) owns 17% stake i.e. 5.19 billion $XRP : $37.3 billion, 15th richest in US

● Brad Garlinghouse (Current CEO) owns 6.3% stake & more : $9.5 billion

#XRP #xrpthestandard #crypto #Cryptocurrency #Billionaire
9103 2018-01-02 13:29:17 It looks like an additional $50 billion USD has been deposited into Cyryptos since the New Year. More and more people are getting involved in the crypto revolution. This can only benefit alt coins like #electroneum #etn long term #hodl this is our year..... Astonishing sums 
9104 2018-01-02 13:29:16 I would highly recommend taking a good hard look at $MCO and consider throwing some $ in their for a couple of days. Expect a 20% return. Place your buy order at 110 and sell order at 150. 4 Day bid, 20% return! #crypto #altcoins #bitcoin #Mooncoin
9105 2018-01-02 13:29:14 Liquidity is one of the biggest problems in crypto, and the worldbook will solve it. Exchanges that wont use qash will miss out on a lot of volume. It is a win-win if they use qash. They have a very big, experienced and transparant team. Already some partnerships in place.

9113 2018-01-02 13:28:38 I completely disagree that "public debate" will defeat this kind of movement. They won't be convinced and debate for them is a way to claim space. It is entirely naive to think public debate will defeat a movement that is opposed to logic.

9138 2018-01-02 13:26:32 Crypto currency tou kaafi libertarian idea hai. It was started because a bunch of geeks wanted to give financial freedom to the poor and middle class. To break the shackles of crony capitalism of banks.

9419 2018-01-02 12:57:02 This one of the reasons I’ve been investing into #bitcoin and other crypto currencies bc im tired of working man I’ve been here 15years I’m sick of this shit 
9420 2018-01-02 12:56:58 Like when I was looking into #poe & the people that are onboard all have experience in this field and other useful areas, can definitely see it doing very well. At the start I hovered around different coins but started moving to the ones that make the most sense in the real world
9421 2018-01-02 12:56:58 I feel like #TRX is the next big thing. In your opinion #Tron is goin to be worth how much in the next 6 months? #BTC #XRP #LTC #CRYPTO

9424 2018-01-02 12:56:53 Id love to see this. 20 seems high & a long way to go. You think Trx dogs, a coin lock up & burn (idk if they are doing both.) The Obike partnership & the Alibaba member could have it raise this much? Thats a 1.3Trillion market cap. The whole crypto class combined isnt  that big
9425 2018-01-02 12:56:42 Call it education. Many ppl will get burned just for throwing money out there. But thats not just #crypto. #xrp made a smart move to bridge financial world and #blockchain and for how much i dont like its centralization it is helping a lot

9488 2018-01-02 12:51:04 I think they set up crypto land to escape the presence of normal traders. But they followed, all the way from stinky pinky land.
9489 2018-01-02 12:51:03 Its already so exciting for crypto in 2018, there are so many amazing projects set to boom.

Ripple, ETH (huge year), OMG, NEO

And my underdog REQ

But there are so many that will grow extensively this year, im flat out keeping up researching.

What are your picks ?
9490 2018-01-02 12:50:50 after being in the crypto market for six months, it has drastically changed my financial future. take the time and effort to study the market in 2018 bc the opportunity is happening right now. let your money work for you while you sleep and you wont need to work 9 to 5 ever again

9518 2018-01-02 12:48:43 They have some major announcement coming.  On the basis of that I think possibly it will be $1000 per coin by November
9519 2018-01-02 12:48:38 Si je peux me permettre un conseil: à ceux qui choisissent de hold (Pas deux jours, pas deux semaines, mais quelques mois voire quelques années) tout ou partie de leur capital en crypto, je vous conseille de tout bouger sur un wallet hors des échanges.
9520 2018-01-02 12:48:35 That’s a good point, for almost the whole year it showed stability and moved up with facts, it means #xrp is not all speculation and is more of a safe investment. However, I am with in that the $100 mark is difficult to achieve, but $10 could be easily surpassed in the midterm.

9541 2018-01-02 12:45:59 Yes, I know Ripple is a big part of it...however, the fact that the crypto sector just hit a new ATH market cap of $645 billion tells us the "Great Crypto Correction of December 2017" is over; - and the "Unprecedented Crypto Explosion of 2018," just starting!

9617 2018-01-02 12:38:13 And had an almost static growth for the rest of the 350 days.  I’m not against #xrp #ripple in any way. In fact, I am holding some. But the numbers just don’t support these claims of short term target of 7USD and the long term target of 100USD

9629 2018-01-02 12:36:49 I guess you mean that it is more. If yes you are correct. Official inflation where I live is 2,5 %. With hidden inflation it is much more. Between 5 to 15 %, every year.

9635 2018-01-02 12:36:08 ビットコインとETFについて。
去年3月に一度ETFの申請がされたが、否決→BTC暴落。否決される前は楽観ムードでメディアも煽っていたし、皆の期待感に比例して価格はうなぎ登りだった。したがって、今回のETFも前評判とは関係なく無情に否決されるシナリオも想定しておくべきと考えてます。

Did 5x till now with just 1 or 2h per day.

9754 2018-01-02 12:27:29 Envie d'investir sur de la crypto monnaie en ce début d'année 2018 ?

Viens en MP je t'explique toute la démarche à suivre de A à Z

9757 2018-01-02 12:27:23 You realize even if this happened, there would then be 2 separate XRP coins/XRP networks and people invested would have equal proportions of both & could then make their own justified decisions on which path to follow/stay invested in or both. Even that scenario seems fair to me
9758 2018-01-02 12:27:22 Tron #TRX looking good on the charts. The only way its headed on the one day chart is UP n UP. 
#Crypto #Bitcoin #Ether #TRX #ALTS
9759 2018-01-02 12:27:18 $ARDR and $IGNIS sure to be top 20 (again) soon... but closer to top 10. $ARDR the car... $IGNIS the fuel (fire)!
9760 2018-01-02 12:27:18 Heck yes! I bought this 2 days ago..love it when A call matches up to yours! $lbc

9884 2018-01-02 12:11:49 You should also keep making updates videos And make as many as you can, (once a day max ofc) this will be a very good content that will  definetly draw people to come back to your channel. You should also talk more about TA and how you think cryptos you believe in will grow.
9885 2018-01-02 12:11:48 Yes, other then USD. Last I checked I can't settle a USD transaction to other side of the planet in 4 seconds. Any crypto could stand in, if you don't mind waiting forever for transactions to complete, or a bottleneck of low tps

9936 2018-01-02 12:07:00 If you bought into TRON ($TRX) when i mentioned it (2 days ago), you would now be up x2, keep HODLING lots of announcements to come for TRON in Q1 :)

9937 2018-01-02 12:06:40 And that's not to say that any divergence automatically means something. Also the same argument could be used in the last pump cycle (spring), but with a fast look I don't see the same image, at least not so clear as now. (will share charts when I am back in the computer)

9939 2018-01-02 12:06:26 As I've stated before, imo 2018 will be the year of decentralised exchanges and anonymity coins. Look at the pain points in crypto for the last 6 months and see who is finding solutions for these.

9977 2018-01-02 12:03:10 Because public ledger is needed for mass adoption. If you want to buy something from a merchant and the transaction can’t be seen then it have a problem with claims and returns. So public transparent ledger is needed. And while ip is obfuscated you remain anonymous.

9986 2018-01-02 12:02:06 Makes sense, does it matter though? I mean, if the price is 10 times higher than one month ago but the exchange of tokens (volume) is smaller than the same period isn't that the definition of a divergence?
