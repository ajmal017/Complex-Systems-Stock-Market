12 2018-09-01 23:11:19 I am truly appalled by how little to no mention of the Prison Strike I’ve seen in the vegan community. A vegan world is one where all living beings seize to be commodities. The abolishment of slave labor and prisons is incredibly important for the liberation of All.

39 2018-09-01 22:02:45 Trump is desperate for a win, and considering the fact that he does not care at all about his own people, he certainly will not give any heed to Venezuelans. You will be trading a commodities crisis for a colonialist one. He will only sell off your resources to his friends.
40 2018-09-01 22:00:10 Butno roads, electricity, food for the masses, running water, sewage system and other basic commodities of life. But well, bourgeoise award ceremonies. Misplaced and short term priorities.
41 2018-09-01 21:53:29 Até um certo tempo, o PT só fez prosperidade pois o Dollar americano na época teve uma desvalorizada básica e a China, comprou os commodities brasileiros, não foi Lula
42 2018-09-01 21:47:42 @JKAR_0ne you realise that once fuel prices increase, it in turn affects prices for all other commodities. So there is need for everyone to be concerned. It ain’t funny anymore.
43 2018-09-01 21:44:47 agree w 1 & 3 - batteries, drivetrains, driving aid systems will become commodities and won’t confer Tesla a competitive advantage but overall system integration + car experience might.
44 2018-09-01 21:22:29 when lilliam pumpernickel said "gucci gang gucci gang gucci gang gucci gang" he was referring to capitalism’s tendency to industrialize culture. when we reduce ourselves to our commodities we subconsciously group up in "gangs" so we don’t feel alienated.
45 2018-09-01 21:17:02 Oh, I think he has such little regard and respect for humanity; he thinks less of us and views humans only as commodities.  He is not, by nature, curious or inquisitive in the least.  Nope, he is too stupid to wonder.
46 2018-09-01 21:05:12 I'd say the same of that 'Ass Clown' Mayor of Vancouver, the mayor of a city built by Canada's largest(?) shipping Port & who decides he doesn't want to ship certain items or commodities from a G7 port that are demanded daily & used the world over.  Really?
47 2018-09-01 21:02:35 About USD INR, we all know that 69 is less than 71; so USD INR 69 means a stronger rupee. Rupee valuation depends on multiple factors like forex inflow, prices of global commodities like crude oil or heavy machinery, fiscal or monetary policy, import export, global economy etc.
48 2018-09-01 20:50:16 How does a Giga Factory give Tesla an advantage? Only if other car companies are not able to obtain sufficient LIB supply at the same price that Tesla pays. Lots of engineering and science in LIB, but I suspect they will become global commodities soon, if they are not already.
49 2018-09-01 20:47:52 A litre of petrol in Moyale a town about 800 kms away from Addis Ababa Ethiopia goes for Ksh 75. Diesel is about Kshs 55. Ethiopia is a landlocked country and still you can get these commodities this cheap.  Probably it's much cheaper in Addis Ababa.  @Mheshmohaa @msaladus
50 2018-09-01 20:42:00 #forcedmarriage is about dehumanisation and a system of human beings being commodities, objects to be owned and sold into #slavery. It's a violation of human rights, exploitation, servitude and it must be the outrage of everyone. No future can be lost.
51 2018-09-01 20:28:54 Why should Kenyans pay kshs 127 for 1ltr of petrol @UKenyatta just because @CS Rotich is over borrowing hence forcing the Breton woods institutions to ask us pay for fuel commodities in order to repay our debt #AgendaFour will fail miserably, thank me later!!
52 2018-09-01 19:58:54 'Kumira kumira' where did we go wrong? Price of fuel is at Ksh 127, with expectations all other commodities will increase in price.
53 2018-09-01 19:57:12 Dear @Lions, @52Mack_ would have been amazing for a long suffering fan base and this team. Congrats on letting a division rival acquire him for unknown future commodities. That is all...
54 2018-09-01 19:56:27 And cost of basic commodities
55 2018-09-01 19:51:14 Unproven commodities vs a known star who you can build your defense around. Saw a great pro Mack argument: name 1 Chicago 1st round pick since 2001 that you would take over Mack
56 2018-09-01 19:30:45 The most innovative firms usually hire only the truly talented. But in general, no. See res. by Hunt, Doran, Bound etc., incl. my own. One can't optimize 2 objectives at once, and given the lower pay of H-1Bs, most firms are hiring for (perceived) cheap commodities, not talent.
57 2018-09-01 19:30:11 It’s a bunch of unproven commodities

63 2018-09-01 19:06:16 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
64 2018-09-01 19:02:09 America wants to work with China remember China is heavily invested in the USA real estate and commodities market they own more than a 1/3 of our pork and agriculture already to tariff these commodities is just counterproductive this is about reciprocal trade let’s make and deal
65 2018-09-01 18:57:29 I just think it’s always good to develop talent in your system and trade commodities, and get value back that’s the only way you can compete and stay relevant.
66 2018-09-01 18:54:10 Pra trazer o Brasil “do Lula” de volta, tem que combinar com o mercado mundial para subir o preço das commodities, a China comprar mais, e o mundo baixar o Dólar ... ninguém que assumir a Presidência vai conseguir “aqueles tempos” de volta. Então, pessoal do PT, parem de mentir
67 2018-09-01 18:49:12 Fair enough. But what is your suggestion for the carnage happening in dairy in the US? And in Aus? Where can we find the balance? Also...what makes dairy different then other ag commodities? Around the world dairy is an issue. Is it the defrag of milk ingredients?

69 2018-09-01 18:45:45 i love the show #FleaMarketFlip on @hgtv, but HATE when women negotiating prices with flea market vendors mention a price and then throw in "and a hug?" and act like twits to get a cheaper price. women's bodies aren't commodities.

73 2018-09-01 18:29:20 You must be a HFT commodities broker.
74 2018-09-01 18:26:42 It might have something to do with it but cheese and butter were also v rare commodities when she was growing up and into her adulthood so I doubt she had a chance to test it out. And by adulthood she was firmly against them.
75 2018-09-01 18:22:58 Isn't that called commodities ? 
76 2018-09-01 18:21:34 What nonsense are u taiking still supporting bjp for the petrol hike.Record high prices for diesel means that the cost of transporting goods goes up across the country. In turn, prices of essential commodities like fruit and vegetables as well as other goods increases.
77 2018-09-01 18:18:33 Lots of logics/views can be described and declared by arranging datas being at comfort zone. Surely they don't know the prices of the essential commodities even. Prices are not commensurate with the growth of the country. Can anybody deny this?
78 2018-09-01 18:06:59 Kenyan leaders are making Kenyans citizens illiterate when they are not....you go to Parliament rather than talking about our rising prices for commodities you go talking about trush and how you import you T-shirts from Mauritius we not here to develop your mental disorder
79 2018-09-01 17:57:55 The 16% VAT tax on fuel will automatically increase the cost of living, Means higher prices of commodities and services. Must be resisted at all costs. Brunt of inflation is a waiting the middle class and the poor #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
80 2018-09-01 17:47:02 This a vague, hand-waving aspiration, not a business. It’s also not something where Tesla has any advantages. Solar and batteries are even more certain to be capital-intensive low-margin commodities than EVs.
81 2018-09-01 17:45:24 Yes i know that but im amused how in low inflation prices of essential commodities are high
82 2018-09-01 17:42:51 Stay away from metals, sugars and cyclicals. If you really need to be there choose debt free companies. Sugar and other essential commodities must stay away! Paper, steel try to avoid. Oil/gas think thrice about price you pay. Cement buy if financials are good.
83 2018-09-01 17:40:01 Players in these leagues are commodities, to be traded, bought and sold like oranges on wall street, these leagues see players as pass through you pass through they make their money off you throw you out like trash, it's up 2 Players to care about their financial futures
84 2018-09-01 17:33:52 Fuel products most taxed commodities in Kenya; On landing at the Mombasa Port, a litre of Super Petrol is priced at Ksh.57.53
Storage &distribution charges at Ksh4.41 are added to this figure, while a profit margin for importers is set at Ksh.7 a litre

85 2018-09-01 17:23:35 Meu ponto é outro. Não adianta nada achar correlações entre ativos brasileiros, seja rf, rv ou terras. É inconclusivo. 

Mas ao achar o link com algo de fora, com commodities, vc mata a dependência do ambiente doméstico. Causas políticas morrem, e o político vira consequência.
86 2018-09-01 17:22:32 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta 16% VAT on petroleum products will lead to increase in price in all basic commodities like Sugar,Cooking fats ,maize flour .
I regret for voting for @UKenyatta twice last year
87 2018-09-01 17:13:45 From the bottom of my heart I’d like to thank the @Raiders for trading a HOF-type pass rusher to my beloved @ChicagoBears for complete unknown commodities #MonstersAreBackBeatch
88 2018-09-01 17:07:44 Two are sophomores who are under the radar right now, but Samuel's and Edwards are known commodities
89 2018-09-01 17:06:19 If I am right, then US Dollar will decline vs other currencies & commodities will follow oil down
90 2018-09-01 17:02:34 Heard that,  in 2016 all I heard was Obama appointed Lary Summers and Robert Kagan,  and Hillary touted Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, Wellfare "reform" and NAFTA.  Unbelievable right? A dem would never do that.
91 2018-09-01 17:01:45 We know he see all these idols a commodities already. Those slave contracts were v telling. It's beyong creepy. It's criminal. I doubt ethics will play a part in his idea. And I doubt the K govt will step in if it promises the country a lot of revenue.
92 2018-09-01 16:30:59 An irresponsible government is never worth of its name. Mark my words, the increased fuel prices which will subsequently affect the prices of other commodities and hence increase in inflation is the recipe for a revolution. A hungry person suspends dialogue and reason.
93 2018-09-01 16:02:33 It is my humble firm belief that here in the Philippines, if the Government created a chain of stores' system in which it will sell basic commodities at a lower but affordable price, it will stabilize the prices of such commodities, plus it will help combat the rising inflation.
94 2018-09-01 16:02:01 It’s also a wonderful example of how misunderstood the gold market is. There can’t be a gold bubble in the way they imagine. There can be a paper bubble, but in that case gold will be just be a less bubblicious bubble compared  to a whole host of commodities.
95 2018-09-01 16:00:30 That sounds like a guy u should trade for some future unknown commodities.....
96 2018-09-01 15:50:12 Con los commodities bajando a la zona de 300 dólares la tonelada y costos en suba, las retenciones son muy recesivas, el mundo no es el de la soja de 600. Fíjate
97 2018-09-01 15:48:44 Interesting to see how Chinese economic growth figures prominently in "The investing case for unloved commodities" by @IANMCGUGAN for @globeandmail on @GoldmanSachs report. Don't forget about Korea! We have a great partnership with POSCO DAEWOO on our Kwanika copper-gold project.
98 2018-09-01 15:45:08 But unfortunately, we are all targeted in the new VAT on fuel & the expected price increament on all essential commodities & services
99 2018-09-01 15:42:35 De commodities a granel, 8/9 habra?
100 2018-09-01 15:40:31 Es una estimación, no sé si precisa, tendría que hacer las cuentas. Pero si el agro solo representa un 15% del PBI, y con un boom de commodities pasara a ser (exagerando) un 25% del PBI, con el % de crecimiento en esa época de 6-7%, cuánto representa ese extra 10%?

102 2018-09-01 15:35:36 Only a Lifeless but bold President would reject overtures to open his country's borders to US agricultural commodities. No wonder he was labelled "Lifeless." But if that is what lifeless is, then My President Buhari is truly "Lifeless!"

106 2018-09-01 15:32:02 I respect your reply & i somewhat agree. However, we need regulations to curb carbon output but they won’t work unless there’re immediate financial consequences. I almost think the GOP wants hurricane destructions so that they can game on commodities/building supplies.

113 2018-09-01 15:05:42 Think if it like this: there is a lot more science in an LED or OLED screen than there is in a battery. But screens are still commodities.
114 2018-09-01 14:56:54 I get it, certainly. it just generally doesn't work out that way. I'm a big fan of trading 1st's to multiple top 50 picks, I'm not in favor of trading known commodities such as Mack for picks. But we understand each other here.
115 2018-09-01 14:56:47 Essa notícia trata especificamente do mercado cambial. Não houve abertura de mercado. Tanto que o Macri continuou manipulando o câmbio, uma das causas da crise, além de controlar fortemente a taxa básica de juros e o sistema de preços, commodities, etc.
116 2018-09-01 14:52:03 Hilarious. How can anybody not think this is a home run for our Beloved? Trading two total unknown commodities for one of the most dominant players in the game? This is a home run. Period. End of sentence. #BearDown
117 2018-09-01 14:46:06 You love only yourself.
You're too stupid to understand the value of the Canadian dairy system, and how it helps their farmers and maintains SECURITY in their food chain.
Meanwhile, in the US, Dairy farmers are going under because commodities traders keep their costs too high.

124 2018-09-01 14:24:17 that capsule-coffee design system that is so popular with the plebs is horrifying....I hear it tastes good but the plastic/energy waste is mad....and coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world....unethical design
125 2018-09-01 14:17:55 NFL “fans” are becoming weird. How is 2 unknown commodities better than an all pro player?  Y’all the same dudes who would tell GB not to sign Reggie White
126 2018-09-01 14:13:20 $XLM once we start tokenizing securities and commodities they will all be traded on the stellar Network. Stellar is doing more than most coins in the area of mainstream adoption.
127 2018-09-01 14:08:11 As you'd expect if they are massively short oil/commodities
128 2018-09-01 14:07:49 Help everybody farmers and consumers alike repeal Commodities modernization Act that Bill Clinton signed into law Force speculators to take delivery of the commodities.
129 2018-09-01 14:07:23 Please look at the price of the commodities, fuel, gas and etc.
130 2018-09-01 14:07:14 Proven commodities> potential from draft picks. 

You probably hate the Bears trading for Mack. TWO first Rd picks for one player. THE HORROR!!!
131 2018-09-01 14:06:27 1. Tener tasas del 60% + alto encaje + devaluación implica apostar a la movida financiera
2. Las exportaciones argentinas son en su mayoría commodities, un área de baja empleabilidad
3.Cobrar impuestos no vuelve a Macri un socialista
132 2018-09-01 14:01:13 Increasing the value of the commodities is a theory of conspiracy & sinister plan. The students studying Economics/Commerce are more confused by the capitalist universities with wrong explanations & interpretations.
How could the value increase - gods grace?
133 2018-09-01 14:00:29 Capitalism turns freedom into a commodity, like it does to everything. It distributes it in a market the same way it does all commodities - you get more if you can pay more. They say if you can pay more, you deserve it, but take a look at how things really play out...
134 2018-09-01 13:54:52 Actually...they aren't commodities. People buy comics based on writer, artist, storyline etc. Commodities are raw products that aren't distinguished by production techniques e.g., a pound of coal is pound of coal. Yes, I am that guy, sorry.
135 2018-09-01 13:49:30 Kenya kept on borrowing, all the money went into corrupt hands and now the public have to suffer.

Tax on fuel doesnt only mean high petrol prices but also commodities and other goods. I pray for the well being of this country. #Kenya
136 2018-09-01 13:49:00 Mack’s already elite vs. 2 completely unknown commodities.  I mean the dudes in his prime and won defensive mvp 2 years ago!  Even the best gms barely have a 50% hit rate on 1st rounders, really this is like giving up one 1st rounder.  
137 2018-09-01 13:46:16 Many that receive the effects of those benefits reject them out of hate. All social benefits received are passed on to others that may not need them. When they removed commodities for the benefit of retail groceries is a great example and a ruin of health for the poor.
138 2018-09-01 13:44:43 #SackRotich #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta @UKenyatta @WilliamsRuto we are so tired of the high costs of loving. Whatever else you do is useless until you cancel altogether the 16% Vat on fuel and reduce tax on other basic commodities. You are losing it
139 2018-09-01 13:44:37 One problem with blaming
Just bankers-As world's most 
terrible wankers.
There's general grist were fiat exists. 
Still, houses need plumbing commodities can't flush.
Middle class flourish by fiat. You know full well
Don't bother to blush-
Home ownership
Is *the* ulitimate rush.
140 2018-09-01 13:42:56 @UKenyatta just sell this country and give everyone his/her share,just the other day during kibaki and @RailaOdinga leadership the cost of living was relatively cheap but since you came to power the price of all commodities doubled,external debt rising by 4.2T #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
141 2018-09-01 13:42:13 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta #SackRotich Punda amechoka. This war on corruption won't seem, look successful of Kenyans continue to suffer high cost of living. So @UKenyatta unafanya kazi bure making deals yet Kenyans pay more for basic commodities. It's useless
142 2018-09-01 13:40:08 Y hablas de retrógrados en otro tweet, y tú propuesta es incentivos al sector agrícola y de commodities, una pérdida de tiempo leer esto, prefiero escuchar a Peña...
143 2018-09-01 13:29:29 let's reduce corruption instead of raising prices of crucial commodities.The high cost of living is oppressive #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
144 2018-09-01 13:27:25 Prices of basic commodities will be hiked too as result of the high fuel prices. So nobody is safe
145 2018-09-01 13:27:20 Living in a trailer in the middle of no where miles from a major city, wearing two anklets the courts issued. No running water or sewer and no electricity. Commodities delivered once a month enough for one person now figure it out for both you and Melanie 

146 2018-09-01 13:27:18 Because they sell hope and meaning. And these my friend are popular commodities.
147 2018-09-01 13:27:04 Exactly. Women are toys and commodities. We're not human in their eyes.
148 2018-09-01 13:22:55 How many of our children have to be sacrificed on the altar of war before we learn that our children are more valuable commodities in peace?
149 2018-09-01 13:22:53 The ripple effect of the hike on fuel prices will soon hit the common mwananchi who doesn't drive. Basic commodities will become expensive and we'll still buy them as we sigh, #TanoTerror #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
150 2018-09-01 13:15:24 Não tinha visto a sua resposta. Bem, como corolário disso, imagino que vc associa a sua visão otimista de bolsa de médio prazo à uma visão otimista com commodities. A propósito do gráfico, consigo imaginar varios  outros com uma correlação bem melhor com o Ibov em USD.
151 2018-09-01 13:13:31 Yes. Tyrants who raise prices of common household commodities like Baby Care and Vaseline petroleum jelly! Sad!
152 2018-09-01 13:12:46 Price increase on petrol = 
Price Increase in manufacturing
Price Increase in transport
Price Increase in basic commodities...
Basically this is a price Increase on your entire life....
Just add 16% to your current cost of living & you get what GoK wants! MORE #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
153 2018-09-01 12:57:49 All public servants will call a countrywide strike to register their anger against the 16% VAT imposed on petroleum fuel. Are they going to increase our salary to cushion our financial inadequacies as a results of increase prices of commodities?  #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
154 2018-09-01 12:47:54 Yes. Quite amazing response by Indians. I think the anger against fuel isn't that high mainly because other essential commodities are well within the acceptable range. So it was actually the inflation that was hurting.
155 2018-09-01 12:32:21 Let the goverment Subsidise other basic commodities these crap of Polio vaccination campaign is another scam somebody pocketing billions under expense of someone health..its more than it meets an eye.
156 2018-09-01 12:30:28 Will we stop eating too given that the prices of food and other basic commodities will definitely go up?
157 2018-09-01 12:26:59 He will be a great Senator.considerable aid, including money, fuel, fertilizer and various other commodities. Our country is doing great!
158 2018-09-01 12:18:29 Mundell's once said that the major ccy area which will track more to commodities will in long run win. This point of view I do find quite possible.

161 2018-09-01 12:09:13 #ONGCForKerala
Noble work by means of ONGC. It has committed after assist the regimen of kerala by way of substantiation clinical help or other crucial commodities.
162 2018-09-01 12:03:44 Home delivery services of meals and commodities isn’t the new and innovative idea they claim, but a tried and true business model that worked for all Americans 50-150 years ago.
163 2018-09-01 11:59:30 #ONGCForKerala
Noble work by ONGC. It has committed to help the state of kerala by proving medical assistance and other essential commodities.
164 2018-09-01 11:56:39 I think I said it be4 with little manufacturing Australia needs capital inflow to add to revenue from resources/commodities export to sustain balance of payment. While with capital inflow comes with immigrants. It's that simple. Its survival depends on this. Anyway my 0.02.
165 2018-09-01 11:54:38 Various Laws n Rules R there to help common man & Discipline Suppliers.Drugs&Cosmetics Act n Rules , MedicalDevicesRules,Legal Metrology Act,Packaging Rules , Essential Commodities Act, DPCO, Magic Remedies Act , AERB Rules,BIS Act & Rules. Alas one needs a lawyer to wade through
166 2018-09-01 11:49:49 How’s the commodities market? You don’t talk about that much or at all. That’s what drives food prices in our country. It’s called socialism, I know, but when you mess with it, prices go up. How’s it doing? Do you understand how it works? What role fed, state and local gov. Play?
167 2018-09-01 11:47:53 That's not good news at all as the common man will have to bear the burden as prices in of other commodities are going to increase. Fares, bread, salt etc will see sharp price increment
168 2018-09-01 11:45:15 So as the #ERC hikes up the fuel prices, some kenyans will start using it as an excuse to inflate the prices of their commodities. Hawkers will hike prices of"PK" or "FRESH" chewing gums using high fuel prices as an excuse
169 2018-09-01 11:36:13 I think Macri’s ideological beliefs of the markets and implementations of austerity policies have failed woefully. The biggest policy mistake was the floating of lira to make exports competitive. What’s often ignored is currencies are commodities and hv to be competitive as well
170 2018-09-01 11:30:52 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta The fight against corruption is mere PR exercise if Kenyans cannot afford basic commodities bcoz of punitive tax regimes.
171 2018-09-01 11:26:41 Ball players are commodities for ball teams...  He is now considered damaged goods.... and very expensise to boot.   it's not personal, it's business. ...
172 2018-09-01 11:16:38 Now that's the cost of ignorance. Have you ever heard of INFLATION? Any slight increase in fuel prices destabilizes the whole economic system. Fares will hike, cost of commodities will hike. Everything hikes, even ejaculation will be impossible with the hunger you will face!!!
173 2018-09-01 11:09:30 Introducing you to Growlinks, an Agricultural entity registered as Growlinks International Commodities Limited #www.growlinks.com.ng
174 2018-09-01 11:07:13 Fuel control literally everything in Kenya, meaning an increase in fuel prices translates to skyrocking of prices to all basic commodities. More reasons why, we must rise up against this oppression 
#PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
175 2018-09-01 11:02:18 I value our relationship with the US.  But for too long we have been complacent on trade. It’s easy when they are right there.  I say take them to the international courts. Build pipelines. Sell our commodities to other markets for better prices.  It will hurt. Worth it long term
176 2018-09-01 11:01:41 Smritiirani ji atleast don't fake atleast on GDP figures.We know that Ur blind supporter of nomads.
Already India's GDP has gone to all time low & how can we achieve above 8%(check valuation of Rupee Vs USD, check oil prices& essential commodities prices)reality malumhoti.JaiHind
177 2018-09-01 11:00:21 Sir any app for farmers where daily rates of commodities, fertilizer, pesticides can be cheked ??
178 2018-09-01 10:56:53 Sad how they treat artists like commodities
179 2018-09-01 10:52:31 DTI Usec. Ruth Castelo: Ito (SRP) ay para ma-inform lalo na ang ating mga consumer. Kung mayroon silang mga store na mas mataas sa SRP ang benta ng BNPC (basic necessities and prime commodities), itawag lang sa atin.
180 2018-09-01 10:48:30 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.
181 2018-09-01 10:39:54 @CelticFC I presume you will offer replacement shirts to all of the unfortunate individuals who have spent hard earned cash inscribing one of your now gone commodities in the back
182 2018-09-01 10:21:51 Basic commodities like Fuel, shouldn't be over taxed. CS Rotich show review this and the MPigs to do what Kenyans are paying them to do. 16% VAT tax on fuel not FAIR!

#PunguzaBeiYaMafuta HARAKA! Hatupendi Ujinga.
183 2018-09-01 10:20:44 stop treating art supplies as precious commodities and use them already coward
184 2018-09-01 10:14:29 Poor people don't buy petrol for their cars and bikes. I buy because I can afford it.  Fuel Price hikes have not affected the price of commodities poor buy.
185 2018-09-01 10:06:21 Nonsense!!!!!! Do u only think that fuel is all about ur vehicle!!!! The whole economy will be affected from escalating prices of basic commodities. Puga!!!
186 2018-09-01 10:05:52 Our exports through Lahore to India are worth of million dollar trade daily, in different commodities. But most of it is done under invoice. Let me give an example of one commodity "gypsum". state bank has order to sale this product in 20 dollars but exports sale in 16.75$
187 2018-09-01 09:54:32 First thing new govt make priority was relief for common man.price hike-high costs on living& commodities effects the most
188 2018-09-01 09:53:04 A rise in fuel prices to such magnitudes given means a rise in the prices of commodities and cost of transport. Why do we want to overburden an already burdened Kenyan? #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
189 2018-09-01 09:50:45 It might depend on the bonhomie created by an economy driven by the middle class rather than stakeholder interests. Folks who earn more, in increased wages, spend more and may even spend with a sense of patriotism to a country that treats its citizens as valued vs commodities.
190 2018-09-01 09:30:06 The more you spend on fuel, the less you have available to spend on other things and the more expensive most other commodities become as nearly all goods are transported by a liquid-fuel supply chain.
#PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
191 2018-09-01 09:21:08 Dear UhuRuto, I want to congratulate you for making our lives miserable,  expensive and hard. 

I wish to plead with you that please increase the fuel prices even more, make basic commodities even more expensive so that we can pay off our loans and have more for you to steal.
192 2018-09-01 09:18:58 @UKenyatta I don't have a car so I don't care about     #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta . But what if price of all food commodities sky rocket.? Then We need 20% pay rise
193 2018-09-01 09:13:22 I don’t think that community is a defensible reason why forks aren’t a threat to decentralized products and protocols. When these services become commodities, users will use what works the best at the time. It’s like choosing to call a Lyft or an Uber in today’s world.
194 2018-09-01 09:06:49 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta Imepanda na 16% VAT. The funny part commodities rise with 40%. Why?? Kenya is a man eat man society. Commodities should rise with 16% as well.
195 2018-09-01 09:06:33 We are overburdened of unemployment, corruption and prices of essential commodities like sugar have gone through the roof. Now 16% VAT on petroleum products is virtually the same as ripping-off Kenyans their hard earned money #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
196 2018-09-01 09:05:09 My point was petrol drives the economy in most of the developing countries, manufacturing et al. So automatically commodities will go up as a result. So to solve the sugar problem we look at the root.. Not the leaves.. I am not opposing what you are saying just differen approach
197 2018-09-01 08:58:32 I miss 0.30 lunch so bad, especially burrito day and pizza day. My family had food at home, most of it was commodities from the government, I guess? I don't actually know where it came from, besides a truck once a month. I was lucky compared to a lot of my neighbors.
198 2018-09-01 08:47:08 Aumenterá il costo delle commodities perchè calerà produzione
199 2018-09-01 08:40:41 True Prashant Sir has a very good understanding of commodities contrarian approach cyclicals good managed companies. He is all in one 
200 2018-09-01 08:37:41 This hashtag is important lets do it this is the only way  lets keep on tweeting, there are million people out there who use kerosene what will happen to them ,what will happen to us  who struggle if commodities skyrocket. #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
201 2018-09-01 08:37:14 Il mercato delle commodities è controllato dalle banche amiche di FMI. Pur di non vedere erosi i loro profitti accettano anche l'apartheid al contrario con il disprezzo totale della persona. Pieno stile mercantilista. La persona conta meno del capitale. Mi fanno vomitare.
202 2018-09-01 08:34:28 I thought we pay vat on all commodities in kenya.
203 2018-09-01 08:23:41 To president @UKenyatta, recover all the stolen public assets and stop charging as more on fuel, am tired of paying taxes only for someone else to steal

How are you going to achieve your #Big4 agenda when the price of basic commodities is skyrocketing? #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
204 2018-09-01 08:17:30 @AnilSinghviZEE  what about talking about who  will win  what still there is time for please get common people and ask, what  on the main problem about 15 lakhs and  jobs  price of petrol and commodities going up black money currency rate falling think about this all
205 2018-09-01 08:07:47 Petroleum has been exempt from VAT although it remains one of the most taxed commodities in Kenya. @EnergyMinK @energy_ke #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
206 2018-09-01 08:02:20 Increase in fuel usually has a knock-on effect on all other commodities. So food prices are about to go up drastically. #BoycottFood as well? 
207 2018-09-01 07:55:24 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta we can't service these uncalled for debts by increasing taxes especially on basic commodities. @HKRotich should have thought about debt servicing before going for these loans

209 2018-09-01 07:37:18 I almost never like my fifth-round pick this year. It's so strange. A bunch of drafts will start swimmingly, and then the fifth comes and no one feels right. They all feel similar to so many other commodities. I guess talent clusters where it clusters (subjective as that may be).
210 2018-09-01 07:23:51 Umejipanga bro transport wise but it'll catch up with you when you buy other household commodities, a short term solution though.
211 2018-09-01 07:22:45 We are living in the era of changing the governmental structure. But unfortunately the government didn't notice the on going increases of basic commodities. So what's the point of changing the government structure, if the people are slowly dying of hunger.
212 2018-09-01 07:07:24 I think only in India this insignificant subject is the headline everyday as if heaven will fall. Its so in every country,except in those countries where they export oil.When salary and other income is increasing the cost of other commodities also increase

214 2018-09-01 06:51:02 The question raise by Jaitely was nothing but attempt of Bjp to divert main issue. The BJP is in power. Bjp has to reply for thier corruption, failure, poor education, poor health service, price hike of essential commodities and petroleum product. BJp has to reply . How Bjp ask
215 2018-09-01 06:48:13 Is it possible to just put the country into a state of emergency so that prices of commodities can be controlled?  Just asking?
216 2018-09-01 06:37:35 Ma anche il Venezuela ci fa nulla con il petrolio. Il regime non riesce a sfruttare i suoi giacimenti (leggevo che tra l altro il mancato sfruttamento provoca problemi di degrado nella risorsa). Un regime tanto disfunzionale non permette nemmeno di usare le commodities di base
217 2018-09-01 06:28:13 He has forgotten that crude oil prices is based on the opec decision not govt of India’s decision when crude price goes up other commodities too wl b affected what kind of finance minister he was? Is he dancing to the tune of anti Hindu party congress
218 2018-09-01 06:27:27 Fuel products are part of Kenya’s most taxed commodities; on landing at the port of Mombasa. Why add more tax now when our economy is unstable?

#PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
219 2018-09-01 06:25:14 The congress shoukd now take aggressive stand & oppose price hike of essential commodities and petroleum products, poor education, poor health service, unemployment, farmers problems,law & order problems and corruptions. The congress should become more aggressive. Do not defend
220 2018-09-01 06:18:11 I can just imagine the price of how many commodities will shot with inflation of oil. #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta

225 2018-09-01 05:55:38 Every moment the social lives of common people are going to  destroy day by day.  People are totally puzzeld and misguided. All the market based commodities are exorbitantly high out of reach of poor & middle classes people.

227 2018-09-01 05:40:09 A desvalorizacao das commodities nao eh justificativa para a crise argentina (como nao eh para a venezuelana). A argentina sofre ha anos por politicas economicas de governos peronistas, que dolarizou e fechou a economia, criou diversos subsidios, levando o país ao default..
228 2018-09-01 05:37:30 Increased rate of petroleum products and commodities with simultaneously increased GDP are unbelievable.
229 2018-09-01 05:36:01 Fantastic job PM  . Trade deals work when all sides get tangible outcomes and both societies benefit equally. It’s not just about commodities it’s the mutual respect and trust between nations that inevitably follows.
230 2018-09-01 05:34:52 Outro regime burguês e corrupto, dois países que sofreram com a desvalorização das commodities. NA Argentina a situação é menos grave por ser mais industrializado, mas já tem a maior taxa de juros do mundo rs
231 2018-09-01 05:34:11 Gli unici "mercati" che vogliono controllare i "politici" sono quelli rionali, dei fruttivendoli e delle minutaglie, sulle commodities, futures e tutto il resto dei coriandoli finanziari, chissa' perché, dicono che non si puo' fare nulla. Destino cinico e baro?
232 2018-09-01 05:31:08 @narendramodi, @BJP4India , @AmitShah are trying in vain to make people forget the evils of demonetisation, bad handling of GST, mob lynching of dalits minorities, raising prices of petroleum products, unprecedented fall of rupee, raising prices of essential commodities.
233 2018-09-01 05:28:18 The prices of every day commodities fuel will obviously go up when you paying compound interest on loans till you built your reserves increase your exports address fiscal deficits cut cost  No govt has a magic wand to undo the damage of 10yrs in 15 days .
234 2018-09-01 05:25:54 A dude in my History of Sex class has TWICE mansplained to the professor that ~actually, slaves weren’t commodities, they were assets, like horses, and so when historians say black women were commodified for their reproductive labor they’re ~actually incorrect...

I cannot
235 2018-09-01 05:24:34 Africa has tremendous potential for mass production of agricultural commodities enough to feed the growing world population. Smart agriculture is at the center of it.
236 2018-09-01 05:21:08 The draft is, always has been, and will continue to be, incredibly unpredictable. It’s a crapshoot. We’ve seen teams recently like the Rams push their chips in with proven commodities. When will team’s fascination with draft capital at least slow down?
237 2018-09-01 05:20:30 LABOUR DOESN'T WORK THE SAME AS COMMODITIES. CHOCOLATE BARS CANNOT GO ON STRIKE UNTIL THEY ARE SOLD FOR MORE MONEY. HUMANS CAN. your every word belies that you see workers as objects and your understanding of economics is like if Milton Friedman babysat a kindergartener
238 2018-09-01 05:18:15 Perhaps a bit of narcissism for good measure too. The regrettable thing about it all is that I'm fairly sure this is generally referred to as "toxic masculinity" but its a pretty awful name in a culture of commodities. As branding goes, its... well... toxic.
239 2018-09-01 05:15:18 Which Benefits? Shooting prices of Commodities?
240 2018-09-01 05:06:39 Have u seen the news about airline issues in zim well l believe thats the start of problems for us , have u seen the cash crisis and prices of basic commodities in our country but well his priority us buying chiefs thank u cars  ameno
241 2018-09-01 04:56:10 And we will also fight for the thousands of EJK victims! The numbers are rising. The peso is dwindling. Prices of basic commodities are up to our noses! And traffic is the same as before.
242 2018-09-01 04:48:50 Congress has to become more offensive on social media and in public platform. Pl stop thinking that you will not get support from media. You seek support from common man. The major issue like price hike of essential commodities and petroleum petroleum, unemployment, poor health
243 2018-09-01 04:29:54 I didn't say government serves no purpose, there's a difference between a public utility such as roads and commodities, commodities which I believe can be self regulated by a free market rather than forced government regulations.
244 2018-09-01 04:25:15 filling my home with artifacts (commodities) related to my hobby (pattern of consumption) to reflect my personality (affect) and own the libs (make myself as unrelatable as humanly possible)
245 2018-09-01 04:23:54 Inspite of g d p showing higher trends , prices of essential commodities r soaring high into the sky , prices of gas , petrol and diseal is at all time high . No jobs , common man is suffering badly
246 2018-09-01 04:21:40 If you think this will affect only peop motorists then you miss the bigger picture. This is going to affect every sector and price of commodities is going to rise. Everyone is going to suffer under this new directive, like it or not
247 2018-09-01 04:03:26 Please @WilliamsRuto act on the high prices of commodities. Think were living in a wrong country
248 2018-09-01 04:03:16 Oooooooh what a great job mheshimiwa .....this is the kind of job we are looking for since independent,I think if the all commodities or goods followed the procedure this couldn't happen ,Any way let the cartel's experience on this .I know all Kenyans will support by all means
249 2018-09-01 04:02:44 Iran was the only country that was selling oil to India in Rs, $, and commodities, but uncle sam just screwed Iran. Also, the minor reason is the negativity created by the opposition about India forcing foreign investors to pull $ because they trust ONLY Modi.
250 2018-09-01 04:01:34 Are we living in a wrong country? Kenya  we discovered oil recently at ngamia 1, thought the prices of basic commodities will be favorable but it’s irony! @UKenyatta @WilliamsRuto @RailaOdinga please you’re the people who can save our country from this exploitation. Act!!
251 2018-09-01 04:01:33 And that could very well result in a long-term  $dxy top and possibly revised bearish  sentiment for many now ill-favored commodities as a consequence. If this would play out we may be looking at a bottom in AUD.
252 2018-09-01 03:52:04 Only challenge would be the inefficiency and cost of using port of Churchill. If it was viable the Prairies would be shipping their oil and commodities more from there already. #GoodInTheory #MaybeJustMaybe
253 2018-09-01 03:51:40 The GDP data published by NDA government is totally manipulated  & twisted . If this is growth in GDP than why there no generation of employment.why price of essential commodities & petroleum product are not reduced.Why rupee become more weak. Where is development. GDP data fake
254 2018-09-01 03:40:57 Com certeza, até pq a crise aconteceu, principalmente, no setor terciário, a bolsa de Chicago se manteve firme (a que comanda as commodities do setor primário). Citei ela me referindo a crise atual, que estouro no começo de 2014.
255 2018-09-01 03:37:13 if price of commodities are increasing in Delhi,what are you doing for that. Metro fare increased but you did not cut off the tax on that which can be minimize the metro fare. Now you are more feku than Narendra modi
256 2018-09-01 03:34:26 Mas nesse momento teve aumento de preços de commodities ( justamente o que o Brasil exporta ) deu pra capitalizar mtos dólares ainda, a crise chegou aqui em meados de 2012
257 2018-09-01 03:33:49 You might be right. Corn heads are damn near commodities at this point.
258 2018-09-01 03:21:09 World market + Duterte's #inutil market = price hike in essential commodities
259 2018-09-01 03:06:45 That moment when you come to the realization that your childhood memories are just vapid commodities in video/picture form.
260 2018-09-01 02:50:29 If the market is healthy the general economy is healthy. Jobs , housing, commodities are affordable. Google the Great Depression and the stock market.
261 2018-09-01 02:46:14 Kindly talk on facts and let me know according to you which commodities are getting expensive.                              Diesel prices are affecting the cost of farmers in cultivation and it is worrying .
262 2018-09-01 02:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
263 2018-09-01 02:32:14 A questão maior está nas commodities. Via Paulo Caldas FB. Estudos bizarros!
264 2018-09-01 02:29:51 No LP isso não faz diferença para os investimentos. Dependemos muito mais das commodities do que do governo. Essa questão muda apenas o CP e a intensidade/amplitude dos movimentos no LP.

266 2018-09-01 02:22:26 Pls don't act like a bhakt. If u r not knowing that increase in diesel prices has no effect on increase in price commodities its useless replying your comments. Its a basic principle that becoz of increase in fuel prices , transportation cost increases so the commodity
267 2018-09-01 02:19:04 I know what a reserve currency is. Explain this deal and why it means commodities don't matter.
268 2018-09-01 02:17:03 Corruption must end for Kenya to move on. Why can't you Mr president protect us from this ever increasing tax and price of commodities. It is also corruption of leaders against their people.
269 2018-09-01 02:04:14 For this government everything is going up. For example prices of petroleum products, unemployment, NPA (non performing assets) of nationalised banks,   price rise of essential commodities and finally GDP for the first quarter i.e. from April-18 to June-18.
270 2018-09-01 01:40:07 El precio es el equilibrio entre la oferta y la demanda. No la pone un empresario a su antojo y queda fijo por arte de magia, se llama mercado. Y el principal sector productivo (agro) del país, es precio-aceptante de los commodities. Así funciona el mundo, por mas que no te guste
271 2018-09-01 01:36:00 If buyers dont have alternative buys, they will be hit the most in any case. A hungry man dies of starvation not the sellers of those commodities, history reveals.
272 2018-09-01 01:30:00 What’s in store for commodities this year?
273 2018-09-01 01:03:19 If country stops importing weapons and crude, rupee can become as strong as dollar. Can Nation do without these two commodities? Ask people and more categorically to so called economists.
274 2018-09-01 00:36:28 Sama sama tayong 100M Pilipinong pinahihirapan sa pangakong napako. Bigas 50, Gaso 55, paano pa un kuryente, tubig, pasahe, matrikula atbp basic commodities at serbisyong ubod ng MAHAL.

275 2018-09-01 00:28:56 The commodities collapse threw off a lot of things. But that was a stealth bear market in risk assets.
276 2018-09-01 00:19:42 Venezuela wouldn't happen to have any particularly valuable commodities, would it?
277 2018-09-01 00:03:19 Sim, nem acho que chega nisso pois as reformas virão, ciclo de commodities positivo e etc... mas se perdurar podemos ter barganhas nos FIIs tb.
278 2018-09-02 23:16:29 I’ve just had an epiphany. Why do you have to pay in to the Cartel which is the EU, to benefit from their Customs Union? Surely if there are exportable commodities from either side, it’s in the interest of all to come to an agreement vis-a-vis trade?!
279 2018-09-02 23:14:36 I would like to see this tracked against seasonal conditions and commodities , lots of short term memories and lack of long term outlooks I would imagine

In case if tax is added that is directly transferred to the end consumer which is not the case in agri sector. Industrialist set the price of agri commodities and farmer has to sell at rate

315 2018-09-02 21:14:20 “Sure, I’ll produce 430 K documents including 100K duplicates... as long as I get to pick and choose which ones to produce!”

Absolute BS.  Documents aren’t commodities.
316 2018-09-02 21:05:03 3210: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
317 2018-09-02 21:00:11 I don't really relate well with people who claim to be Zimbabweans and yet they sponsor the economic terrorism happening to innocent civilians by hiding certain commodities so that the blame affects their rivals..
318 2018-09-02 20:53:06 I believe it’s here. Kinda like commodities. You can get locked out and ain’t nada you can do.
319 2018-09-02 20:48:47 So your example is a link to a  blog written by a retired commodities trader that does not mention anything about indictments or pedophiles.

321 2018-09-02 20:43:50 Probably one of the positions it's better to invest in proven commodities whenever they come available?
322 2018-09-02 20:42:03 So is Trump using reverse psychology? Seems to me if you want other countries to remove tariffs on American products you would remove them on foreign commodities 1st.
323 2018-09-02 20:37:09 Looking forward to the markets waking up after the long summer lull. Lots will be looking for new investments and key for me is commodities with demand and a strong outlook such natural gas..... So have refocused my portfolio accordingly 
324 2018-09-02 20:37:03 Hurting the future of energy- renewables. FYI 2013-U.S. oil/gas production is evolving rapidly, demand is dropping so quickly—that in just five years the U.S. could no longer need to buy oil from any source but Canada, according to Citigroup's global head of commodities research.

329 2018-09-02 20:07:49 Isto mostra a incapacidade destes governantes de realmente nos transformar em uma nação soberana economicamente.Somente nas décadas de 90/00,graças ao crescimento da economia mundial é que crescemos,mas a qualquer tormenta mundial sofremos; Dólar,commodities,bolhas.Bolsonaro já!
330 2018-09-02 20:03:46 In agri sector alot of farmers are small scale farmers . They are barely making their living because of the low rates of the commodities they grow. Additional Taxing them would be a grave mistake unless and until govt regulates everything and give good price for its commodities.
331 2018-09-02 19:57:15 Do not get caught up in trying to decide which Middle East sewer nation is our friend and is better than the others - not possible & well we created the mess Bc of commodities - Zapata Oil - 3 cheers for capitalism ( Irving kristol) yeah was bad too
332 2018-09-02 19:56:42 According to David Hume (an 18th century Scottish empiricist philosopher), “Everything in the world is purchased by labor.” Even though commodities are purchased by a majority of the population with money, nevertheless that money was earned by labor.
333 2018-09-02 19:53:36 Shop cheap oil from Canada. Source goods from other countries. Bypass America from MX by sea. Find new customers for our commodities. Fortress America will falter.
334 2018-09-02 19:44:40 Do the reverse of what Henry Rotich has done. Encourage public spending by eliminating or reducing the taxes and levies on fuel and commodities such as milk and home made products.
335 2018-09-02 19:42:24 Who trades on commodities online on a thing like Pluss500?  I've been going a week, with fake money and I am 5k up! Tempted to play for real but I can't help feeling it's a little like gambling.
336 2018-09-02 19:41:05 A basic knowledge of the commodities would suggest otherwise. Our trade agreements are lopsided, and have been for a while. Revisiting agreements are part of our government’s fiduciary responsibility to its citizens. Try not to get too ramped up over it.
337 2018-09-02 19:36:47 ¿Y cuándo ahorraste en épocas de vacas gordas? NOSOTROS LLEGAMOS A RESTRICCIÓN EXTERNA CON LOS PRECIOS DE LOS COMMODITIES EN MÁXIMOS!! Ningún país de la región gestionó tan pero tan mal. Ah sí, Venezuela.
338 2018-09-02 19:36:21 So what is your stand? You don’t feel the burden because you fight for your tumbocrats, why not impose the tax to other commodities? Why petroleum products, useless MPs
339 2018-09-02 19:33:00 Menos de la mitad de los pobres de 2002! Comparado con eso cualquiera es Gardel. Dejaron una bomba inflacionaria con el sobrante de dinero y un déficit similar al 2001. Y de vuelta, se triplicaron los valores de las Commodities, no sé si comprendes lo que significa.
340 2018-09-02 19:30:30 I've listened to this interview with @DavidNdii keenly and yeah,  we are fairly screwed by this jubilee economic thuggery and guess work. There's likely to be no additional tax revenue by taxing fuel. It means less expenditure on other taxable commodities. Zero effect on revenue
341 2018-09-02 19:29:51 Money is directly proportional to the resources available( goods n services). So more money cannot chase few commodities (as in Kenya's case)... It would lead to inflation
342 2018-09-02 19:27:07 Crucial to my point is that there is no essential relationship between brands, commodities and quality - good or bad.
343 2018-09-02 19:25:26 What CS Rotich did is a clever way of Taxing all commodities in Kenya by Taxing the primary component in Production. Kafment should fight corruption and they will have all the cash they need #SundayLive @KoinangeJeff @VickyRubadiri
344 2018-09-02 19:21:52 @citizentvkenya  The government should lower the cost of basic commodities such as sugar, milk, unga and cooking oil.  These are what affects the lives over common wananchi
345 2018-09-02 19:21:26 The Kumira generation should keep us away from "their Maandamano call", in fact the police should maliciously handle them.

Let the fuel price transport them to Kumira poling stations to pick their low price commodities.
346 2018-09-02 19:19:17 Its meant for understanding how speculators act in terms of commodities. By your response I can tell you have never read it.

Wise people seek to learn.....I do not agree with Fekte as well, but he does provide a concise framework of how speculators, warehousing work together
347 2018-09-02 19:10:27 Yes It appears as if GK are going to be commodities in todays game and the very best are going to cost obscene amounts of money. As you say fair play to the scout who found him

349 2018-09-02 18:56:17 #sundaylive common mwananchi is totally in trouble since once fuel goes high, all other commodities goes high too
350 2018-09-02 18:50:14 Exactly. Also transport, food, commodities, housing, healthcare..it affects everything. This would not be so if he had not rigged himself in via IEBC
351 2018-09-02 18:46:53 Currency flows and the history of how commodities, oil in particular, have been intertwined with currency, bonds, and gold is certainly important to study. But yes, the tail can't wag the dog sustainably. Oil market always succumbs to supply and demand, and *rate* of each.
352 2018-09-02 18:45:44 The number of people in the labor force reaches equilibrium based a variety of factors, but mostly wages. 

Consuming one's own leisure instead of commodities isn't inherently worse or less dignified.
353 2018-09-02 18:38:22 Indeed CS Rotich should be impeached how an ordinary Kenyan survive this with price increase in all commodities
354 2018-09-02 18:38:01 The Bears drafting strategy is just shy of commodities in terms of speculation
355 2018-09-02 18:34:07 @citizentvkenya Fuel prices going up means all basic commodities will  go up in prices.Kenyans are already broke.. No economy in the world has grown by taxing the poor.
356 2018-09-02 18:32:29 #SundayLive I don't know how the govt go to con the common mwananchi to settle debts they are stealing from us. It really hurts Jeff    I struggle to pay tax over 15,000 of my gross pay, then it's stolen and tax added on fuel which will affect all commodities. Fedha,  Emba
357 2018-09-02 18:30:41 I noticed JuicyFruit is now 6 bob. Maybe the effects of the 16% fuel tax... Price of everyday commodities will go up  ngumu, beer, electricity, fare, petro & dithoro, tractors, building, wow, everything will go up somehow   
358 2018-09-02 18:30:27 The direct effect will be hiking of fares by the matatus and the indirect effect will be high cost of living due to high prices of basic commodities
359 2018-09-02 18:24:09 Farm commodities, energy prices did not. We are not even 2 years into this one and you have drawn your conclusions. For the first time I have a President that didn't there funded by "Big You Name It" lobby funds. Not beholden to "Big Whatever". I want the resistance to stop

361 2018-09-02 18:19:40 #SundayLive Fuel is the main input in our energy-intensive sectors.The rise in pump priceswill result in an increase in the cost of production and manufacturing of commodities, an increase in cost of transport and an increase in cost of household consumption of goods and services
362 2018-09-02 18:16:20 @VickyRubadiri @KoinangeJeff @citizentvkenya Before the government/politicians impose VAT on basic commodities like fuel products (which is the common denominator to a thriving livelihoods), let them recover the money that has been lost through corruption !  #SundayLive
363 2018-09-02 18:14:59 By your reasoning the ideal economy would be one where a central planner identifies and dictates the exact amount of production and price point at sale of all common commodities. I believe that Karl Marx would agree wholeheartedly with your position
364 2018-09-02 18:09:45 Yup &i fear what might have been organized huge w/w FF (kidnap ldrs/officials evry country?!? Bring world to knees?!? What might be doing online/int'l stkmkt/commodities/Finance industry/money mkt-bonds crash funds pensions etc?!?)
365 2018-09-02 18:07:45 Varsities to lay off staff in cost-cutting bid.
16% VAT on petroleum products.
High cost of basic commodities. 
Inflated power bills.
High level of unemployment. 
Skyrocketing public debt.

Kenya is ready for a revolution.
366 2018-09-02 18:06:15 @VickyRubadiri increase in fuel prices and other basic commodities reduces our disposable income which makes our living standard BAD.we are regretting voting for UhuRuto government.
367 2018-09-02 18:05:47 Time passed is something lapsed for good . Unlike commodities cud never be CALLED BACK
368 2018-09-02 18:04:51 Falta também formação de capital humano no agro além das grandes commodities: não sabemos fazer queijos de maior valor agregado e apreciados em diversos mercados, praticamente não processamos o que produzimos, investimos apenas nos mesmos produtos over and over again.
369 2018-09-02 18:04:15 @SophiaWanuna #Checkpoint Kindly ask this question to Dr. Ndii. How come fuel is cheaper in Uganda and Rwanda yet the commodities pass through Kenya?
370 2018-09-02 18:03:22 Active and Retired Military Veterans are -- and always have  been -- expendable commodities. Politicians (especially GOP) don't want us to see dead Vets; and live Vets sleeping on the streets, or asking for government jobs and pay raises, are only temporary irritations.
371 2018-09-02 18:01:45 Ele é ultra-competente e ajudou a tirar o Brasil do abismo em que o PT (principalmente a Dilma) lançou ele. Ele logo dispara que foi ministro do Lula, antes que “acusem” ele disso. No governo Lula, o Brasil só sobreviveu graças a valorização dos commodities e a ele, Meirelles.
372 2018-09-02 17:54:46 Dont u think growth should result in relief in prices for common man in terms of Petrol /Diesel and commodities (Inflation)...Can u explain the benifits ? Jobs , Inflation, etc...
373 2018-09-02 17:53:03 By the way, last quarter’s GDP was artificially high as our trading partners stock up on those commodities that will be hit by the trade war tariffs in Q3and Q4.
374 2018-09-02 17:50:55 I mean, we already have way less constraints when it comes to biological limitation thanks to the development of civilization and technology. Life expectancy is longer, famine and cold combattable by providing commodities, most diseases curable and no longer lethal.
375 2018-09-02 17:50:15 That's not socialism. That's public services. Public commodities per say. Maybe leftists need to start coming up with a new name for their utopian ideas.
376 2018-09-02 17:45:22 In pharma Sector – Lupin,Sunpharma . In IT Sector – Techm and wipro looks strong
In Commodities Sector :- Ambujacem Jswsteel (jsw-Top in Metal also)
377 2018-09-02 17:43:18 Ideally, VAT on fuel should be zero-rated, not exempted. VAT zero-rating makes commodities more affordable than VAT exemption.
378 2018-09-02 17:39:32 @SakajaJohnson @kipmurkomen  the jubilee government promised to bridge the gap of cost of living by reducing the price of basic commodities.. You don't need to argue here on Facebook just call the president and let him order Rotich to drop this price's down.
379 2018-09-02 17:37:29 Ideally, VAT on fuel should be zero-rated, not exempted (i.e abolished). VAT Zero-rating makes commodities cheaper than VAT exemption.
380 2018-09-02 17:32:52 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
381 2018-09-02 17:31:55 China wants one thing the most; they want the yuan to become the the world’s reserve carrency.  All commodities will then be priced in the Yuan.   Then China is in control of the world money and supply.  Who controls the currency. controls the world economy.
382 2018-09-02 17:20:43 Mihhaelo the old unionised commodities trader
383 2018-09-02 17:15:21 So you guys are seriously telling me kuti one now needs to be connected to nomads like Festo to get basic commodities... Like really really..Mazoe there..Biscuits there..Cement there
384 2018-09-02 17:10:56 The government knew this all along. Once again, hiding facts from American people and government. Liberals blame Trump for everything yet take no responsability for massive PR debt, lack of infrastructure before storm, corruption in use of hurricane relief dollars & commodities.
385 2018-09-02 17:08:23 If someone called for Mass Action today it'd be the mother of all. Cost of living is unthinkable, youths are desperate as vibandas are being flattened and on top they punish citizenly with VAT on essential commodities as fuel #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
386 2018-09-02 17:00:14 The real truth is that since the invention of commodities no group of settlers, community or society exists without reliance on the whole. No nation, no enclave, no organization at all functions without dependence on the participating group. Only hermits live as you claim.
387 2018-09-02 16:59:42 Everyone. The prices of commodities will shoot up
388 2018-09-02 16:52:03 Las criptomonedas no se anclan a nada. Es un tema de confíanza. Si quieres ahorrar sin peligro, refugiate en dinero Fiat o en commodities. También puedes invertir en mercados de capitales en acciones de mínimo riesgo o bonos. Saludos
389 2018-09-02 16:51:18 It seems Mumbai will buy Petrol at INR 90 per litre next week the way price is increasing.
Mr. Modi - do you recollect your words now?? Prices of all commodities are going up. U r killing society.
390 2018-09-02 16:46:46 16% VAT taxes on basic commodities are  signs & symptoms of a great revolution in Kenya.The French revolution is a great example. 
#isalright
391 2018-09-02 16:43:18 This government is a total failure.
They should tax luxurious commodities like beer,cigarettes n soft drinks but not fuel.Fuel is everything and it will affect all the other areas of economy.
Rotich should know that not every man is able to have a lavish life like him
392 2018-09-02 16:41:03 During this summer Expert Geophysics successfully finished MobileMT  surveys in Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan under exploration  programs designed for different commodities.
393 2018-09-02 16:36:53 the problem isn't that work is useless its that businesses, in general, treat them as if they are commodities (interchangeable value). rather than free people up to 'pursue' jobs they value why don't we just make the existing jobs OF value so people doing them don't feel useless.
394 2018-09-02 16:32:26 Look at Canada lol Farms millions of  Canadian jobs offshore. Canada is one of the least populated countries in the world with the most natural rich commodities here but now 90 % of canadians retire poor and you say Trump is no good lol. Trump is trying to get back offshore jobs
395 2018-09-02 16:20:46 Just wait for Syria or Iran to "attack their own people" and the US will just happened to be there ready to launch a retaliation attack and save the world...they obviously don't like Iran ceasing the use of us dollars to trade commodities
396 2018-09-02 16:19:59 #DestroyMaoists Shameful Left Panelists, were interrupting Subhrashtra listing out one by one Maoists misdeeds at tribals areas w.r.t Govt benefits outreach. Shocked to know how Govt subsidised rice and commodities are cornered off & rerouted thro evangelists
397 2018-09-02 16:16:29 U.S. farmers _ bAILouts- Illinois farmer-losing $8 a head on pork, and he is losing money on everything he grows.
Senior Director of Commodities - long term indications because of tariffs. Took 20 years 4 markets back to normal after last trade wars, & bailout farmers for years
398 2018-09-02 16:12:58 Commodities salvaram as falácias do Lula, com isso aproveitou e saqueou o Brasil e te deu uma migalha e vc adora receber migalhas.
399 2018-09-02 16:09:43 Good idea ...but mweshimiwa we us common mwananchi we are suffering on these issue of 16 percentage on Fuel..prices of all commodities will go up.please help us
400 2018-09-02 16:00:21 Porque acá se exporta lo que se come. Nuestros commodities es nuestra comida. Ahí tb hay historia, nuestra dieta y nuestra cultura juega.
401 2018-09-02 15:50:18 Yes, absolutely. It’s virtually impossible to exist outside of capitalism. Everything we need to survive, as well as all commodities, are sold at a profit, robbed from the workers and used to make someone else rich. There is no such thing as ethical consumption in capitalism.
402 2018-09-02 15:49:47 Prices of essential commodities , gas , petrol and diseal r soaring high into the sky , g d p figures r mere statistics and people s sufferings is a reality
403 2018-09-02 15:48:39 I agree 100% that not every company, or wine is a brand. Most aren't, because most wines are bought as commodities.
But I'd say that every product/service with a following, *is* a brand - conforming, not to my, but to @RichardHemming's definition
404 2018-09-02 15:48:16 Waiting for GoK to appeal to retailers not to "overcharge" for commodities. 

They still haven't Gazetted the new minimum wages. 

Prepare yourselves for big surprises at the till.
405 2018-09-02 15:33:53 @SakajaJohnson  as you guys exchange watever this is please add Elec price right next to the fuel. These are basic commodities that will affect every single kenyan whether they drive or not whether they use elec or not, these 2 affect every mwananchi. Hay Jesus
406 2018-09-02 15:28:04 UBI is communistic.

It is a horrible idea, and will either a) become nothing more than a flow-through gift to landlords & grocers or b) require further gov intervention in housing & commodities.

Efficiency doesn't mean right-wing, despite conservatives claiming economic acumen.
407 2018-09-02 15:25:17 Do you believe that when females reach sexual maturity/adulthood their bodies automatically become public commodities? And how do you assign points to various modes of dress within this value system?
408 2018-09-02 15:20:25 Not even in real estate (and it would be tougher this go-around because mortgages aren’t fully deregulated yet) but it looks like they are gunning for commodities (oil can only be bought in USDs) and Rand Paul has been hitting up bitcoin conferences. They are up to no good.
409 2018-09-02 15:20:03 How does that save the youth, when u hv raised the price of fuel leading to the skyrocketing of transport and basic commodities?
410 2018-09-02 15:18:05 En este país berreta adoctrinaron a la gente a pensar en contra de ellos. Nadie les explica cómo bajaron los precios de los commodities y que las cuentas no cierran cómo antes. Y menos que recaudaron a costa de ellos para repartirla y mantener votos...
411 2018-09-02 15:14:57 Cultivating people like commodities; just collectables to impress frienfs and throw aways when they are no longer useful.  sad
412 2018-09-02 15:13:16 Commodities are material energy. A standard Joule amount of energy is the ONLY objective unit of account. Gold's immutability is a proof (cf BTC) of past Joules expended, which is a USELESS/null unit of account. Promises of future energy make Joules a USEFUL +ve unit of account
413 2018-09-02 15:08:06 Welcome, commodities, revisa Oro. Lastima que el Oil tambien sera pumpeado, dejando de lado el gran fracaso americano del fraking, usaran esta oleada para ocultarlo. Trump no aguantara mas la presion de los ambientalistas tampoco, asi que hara caso y dejara q la verdad se muestre
414 2018-09-02 15:08:06 What about those who can't live or get money for basic commodities like unga? because it's automatic they gonna shoot.
415 2018-09-02 15:04:13 I disagree all. He didn't do anything good to Philippine economy and I disagree that he is brilliant. Duterte is not brilliant at all. They keep on manipulating the economic data but the prices of basic commodities is the reflection of his incompetence.
416 2018-09-02 15:03:27 And that is why not all Ag works well under SM. We would be robbing the world of much needed commodities. Dairy works because the global dairy market is already flooded, among other reasons.
417 2018-09-02 15:01:43 @SakajaJohnson Uhuru Has officially Brought Kenya to its Knees, Kenya has turned a heel. The worst we did is to re-elect @UKenyatta the prince will never understand the pain of high cost on basic commodities, is Sukari, Si Mafuta, Si Ufisadi just name it. to him is life as usual
418 2018-09-02 15:01:23 Art is no less subject to economic considerations than are commodities, manufactured goods, and services.  Artists are able to make a living off their art only if consumers are willing to pay for it.

The consumer is king where market forces prevail.
419 2018-09-02 15:01:06 Kenyans stop playing ignorance. The 16% VAT tax on petroleum is just a tip of the iceberg. Tax exemptions on basic commodities sugar, milk and flour is yet to be removed. Stop complaining, stop cowardice organize yourselves and #revolt. @MigunaMiguna. Power belongs to the people
420 2018-09-02 14:58:54 I never said that.  There is a cost to produce physical gold.  I am saying that generalizing the definition of commodity and implying that they all work the same way is incorrect. Physical gold and oil are very different than all other commodities.
421 2018-09-02 14:52:42 em grande parte,2 situações similares:divida externa em moeda exterior, dependencia exagerada de commodities,problemas em importar (a Venezuela tem uma bloqueio dos US e acólitos,na Argentina é premeditado pela desvalorização da moeda).Penaie que só interesse a narrativa política
422 2018-09-02 14:52:32 #agriculture #processing #clusters has potential to boost #farming of specific commodities
423 2018-09-02 14:51:51 Commodities are different than gold because any good or service with economic or utility metrics can be priced relatively by other good or service economic or utility metrics through a currency
424 2018-09-02 14:46:49 @MerriamWebster: To be considered a commodity, an item must satisfy 3 conditions: 1) it must be standardized &, for agricultural and industrial commodities, in a "raw" state; 2) it must be usable upon delivery; & 3) its price must vary enough to justify creating a market for it.
425 2018-09-02 14:44:43 ALL commodities are driven by supply/demand.. that’s literally economics 101
426 2018-09-02 14:41:42 in future i accept good administration. Price Control on essential commodities you will do good work for  to uplift the down trodden and weaker section of all community  and wish successful carrier thanks
427 2018-09-02 14:41:27 Gold and Oil are supply driven commodities.
428 2018-09-02 14:38:01 The ppl who exported them won’t care I know because #greyhounds are just commodities to make money out of , but if they  had any humanity they should be very ashamed .
429 2018-09-02 14:37:26 Just seeing the projected prices of commodities after the fuel prices are hiked
Sirudi Kenya aki..... Acha nipigwe na jua huku kwa waarabu
430 2018-09-02 14:36:49 I would suspect that Heaven and Hell are involved in the worth and commodities of Souls...
431 2018-09-02 14:30:27 Value of commodities is based on supply/demand.. no more and no less..
432 2018-09-02 14:25:38 Just read @ShippersUnbound ‘s excellent latest - Fallout: A Year of Political Mayhem - in which you come out as a voice of calm reason, clarity and insight. Rare commodities in today’s irrational and febrile political world.
433 2018-09-02 14:24:24 Phone and shitting are complimentary commodities
434 2018-09-02 14:24:02 i incorporated social issues (such as increasing prices of commodities, people getting killed by the gov't, people disappearing, etc) in the musical that i wrote and directed even if it was mainly a love story. my sister's classmates will perform it tomorrow. 
435 2018-09-02 14:23:24 Não acho que dê pra simplificar tanto. 
Poderíamos ter aproveitado muito mais o boom de commodities se o governo não tivesse roubado tanto e feito tão mal uso do dinheiro. 
Brasil foi o cara que ganhou na loteria, torrou tudo e agora está devendo até as calças.
436 2018-09-02 14:22:07 Commodities have value based on usage.  Gold has no usage, that's why it's stock to flow ratio is very different.
437 2018-09-02 14:18:30 Heck, you mean we open our borders to all imports without barriers? That's the surest way to develop KE. hell, I know you are a serial commodities importer. You are one of the reasons why we won't industrialise. Profiteering importers.
438 2018-09-02 14:16:24 Gostaria de ver o desempenho de Lula sem boom de commodities... Pensando bem, tá bom assim, deixa ele mofando na prisão lá...
439 2018-09-02 14:07:23 If GOK is dying for money, why can't treasurer or whoever is concerned come up with ways of recovering billions of stolen tax monies from culprits? GOK knows where the monies are. It makes no sense to increase tax on commodities only for it to be stolen under people's watch.
440 2018-09-02 14:05:48 Fifighting ur fight? So you mean you are not a Filipino nor living in PH? Damn gurl, round of applause for this tweet. 
Is our fight about increasing prices of rice,gasoline,basic commodities,importing galunggong with formalin,EJK and rape jokes? Get some  girl. Or eat well.
441 2018-09-02 14:04:57 Expect the cost doing business to go up coupled with the prices to basic commodities
442 2018-09-02 13:56:08 Copeland (1923) was the first to separate commodities from consumer goods, and classified these into convenience, shopping and specialty goods.
443 2018-09-02 13:46:01 Las commodities se cayeron a partir del 2012...por algo todas las experiencias Nacionales Y Populares entraron a tener problemas
444 2018-09-02 13:44:08 The VAT on fuel will make cost of living unbearable @Uhuru Kenyatta. There must be another avenue to generate revenue without affecting basic commodities. #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
445 2018-09-02 13:40:01 Profit is possible everyday .. but recovering from losses is not  a dream .. so trade wisely ..

 #Sensex #Commodities
446 2018-09-02 13:36:32 You are a mine that will produce great commodities and living waters! Out of you shall come cities, vineyards and olives! #TheSovereignChoice
447 2018-09-02 13:27:17 And remember fuel is the backbone of our economy.  So expect a rise in cost of basic commodities very soon.
448 2018-09-02 13:22:56 Do you know why your blessing is taking so long? Do not compare yourself with commodities because you are a mine!!! Not a commodity! #TheSovereignChoice.
449 2018-09-02 13:21:52 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
450 2018-09-02 13:18:50 Of course not. But I wasn’t talking about cost. I was talking about impact.   

As for the cost, 1st round picks are about potential, not proven commodities - just look at the Packers last 5-6 D1s. 

Mack is arguably the Reggie White of his era.
451 2018-09-02 13:13:24 #Bitcoin #crypto will follow suit & believe going to be a HUGE run up to year end

My pick for 2018 is #BLCC block commodities on the NEX exchange.

#Africa #fertiliser #crypto being rolled out in Africa.

700 million unbanked individuals & most are farmers.

#blockchain #Africa
452 2018-09-02 13:06:51 First day at school, played games with MJY (along with a guy whose voice is amazing), enjoyed spicy rice noodles that are made out of asparagus, shopped for some commodities (tissue ,yogurt ,chocolate ), changed sheet, covered the table with blue and white sticky wallpaper...
453 2018-09-02 13:04:32 It will be messy in coming weeks as prices of essential commodities go up
454 2018-09-02 13:03:38 Hedging and dollarizing commodities has a long history, as do global creation of dollars via currency swaps. 

So it follows that this is in fact do-able in crypto, and it merits serving the demand for lower time preference money. 

Not everyone is rich enough to ride volatility.
455 2018-09-02 13:01:01 3 commodities already in short supply. cement, fuel. lacto
456 2018-09-02 13:00:04 You mean these commodities/currencies...?
457 2018-09-02 12:43:28 Ahhhh Ty 
I'm not US based so still learning stuff all the time unless it's hard commodities based global stuff.
458 2018-09-02 12:31:08 When you are done with Soccer and Bobi Wine you will wake up to hiked fares and commodities. That will be Monday since it came during a weekend.
459 2018-09-02 12:07:02 From where I sit, the way Josh Donaldson's time in Toronto ended was just fine. Players are commodities. They play, they get cheque. Teams owe them nothing else and vice versa.  #BlueJays
460 2018-09-02 11:57:09 During hustlers presidency,there shall be nothing like price hike on such basic commodities like fuel.

Frens let's just persevere in this few years!
Kenyans.
461 2018-09-02 11:56:57 How true are you talking any lay men will understand by seeing the value of IRS,fuel, gas price & let not forget basic commodities for the household. #BjpLies
462 2018-09-02 11:55:16 Dear sir
Rs 5/litre hike in milk price still not implemented. Msp is only eye wash nobody is buying at these rates. Government cannot buy entire commodities. Even after 4 month of preservation onion prices r at same level rather lower than that, then whats use of big announcement
463 2018-09-02 11:48:20 #aajtak. in           "अच्छे दिन" means not increasing and decreasing of rates of commodities. Stopping curruption  means "आछे दिन". It will take time. But opposition obstructing in stopping curruption. Even with the help of Pak. and China. Activists and terrorist and nexelites.
464 2018-09-02 11:43:20 Increase in vat on fuel=Increase in transportation costs = less/slow supply of goods/commodities  = high price of commdities/cost of life (high inflation) = less consmption of these commdities = less revnue from tax on these commdities = back to square1 (more external borrowing.
465 2018-09-02 11:42:14 Controlling access to these metals such as lithium and cobalt is only going to grow in importance. What is the US doing to make sure China's ever-increasing expansion in Chile and the DRC (major sources) will not shut US out of these precious commodities?
466 2018-09-02 11:40:26 FROM ETHIOPIA
@Mheshmohaa.@GalgalloAbagaro .@energy_ke .A litre of petrol in Moyale a town about 800 kms away from Addis Ababa Ethiopia goes for Ksh 75. Diesel is about Kshs 55. Ethiopia is a landlocked country and still you can get these commodities this cheap.
467 2018-09-02 11:35:22 In Po Bronson's 'Bombardiers' a battle-worn commodities trader tells an ambitious young banker: "Time. It always seems like there's so much more of it. And there usually is. But once it's gone, it's really gone."

Folks, let's not waste a minute. Our republic is counting on us.
468 2018-09-02 11:29:20 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
469 2018-09-02 11:27:57 USA has a get out of jail free card because the $ is the global reserve currency - otherwise USA would be bankrupt so I read.    Its because there will always be global demand for it, commodities lie oil are traded in $ and countries hold and want $ as safe currency
470 2018-09-02 11:20:44 Johano the yellow non-unionised commodities trader
471 2018-09-02 11:16:02 One of the important benefit of DM n GST implementation,  common men easily felt all food commodities prices nose dived and veggies. Traders are debarred from hoarding the commodities. For a common man it is clear 30 to 40% savings in food bill. What else he needs?
472 2018-09-02 11:01:48 The cost of production will increase as result of fuel price increase hence 
1.prices of the most basic commodities will Go up
2. Most of manufacturing industries will lay off workers
473 2018-09-02 10:59:40 aur abb koi ahtejaj bhi nahi dikhaya jata.... na tomatoes onion ki prices per na baqi commodities ki price hike per......
474 2018-09-02 10:56:38 A alta das commodities nos anos 2000 ocultou os erros criminosos de governos bolivarianos e tmb aqui no brasil, com era lula.. ao inves de usarem estes recursos para implementar uma politica econonica anti-ciclica como fazm chile e noruega, preferiam torrar com populismo barato!!
475 2018-09-02 10:54:03 #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta when will we ever feel we have LEADERS in KENYA??how can you heavily tax the poor populists on basic commodities &the revenue collected ends up on some few individuals??some people will never experience peace...#MbariyaKimendero
476 2018-09-02 10:30:32 One of my profs compared the modern MegaChurch campus loosely w/ historical cathedrals. 

Except cathedrals were surrounded by establishments of service, food, education, etc., but some mega churches have those commodities within: coffee shops, cafes, childcare, education, etc.
477 2018-09-02 10:23:56 What good is a look east policy when fuel has started to be scarce !!!!! Now what's next ???? Commodities
478 2018-09-02 10:22:42 This will have a ripple effect in the price of basic and not so basic commodities but I’m not sure we’ll be outraged
479 2018-09-02 10:17:35 Pathetic...
Prices have doubled on many basic commodities today (2/9/18) whilist you are busy flirting with chinese
480 2018-09-02 10:05:03 3170: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
481 2018-09-02 09:50:07 The only commodities that dont require fuel to operate are living things yet those ones too survive on services that run using fuel. #FuelTaxMustFall
482 2018-09-02 09:45:00 Taxes are charged on income which comes from production of commodities and services that are exchanged in the market. Majority of Kenyan labour power is not employed. Put simply labour value is Zero. Thus, the taxes route is uninformed economics in our circumstance.
483 2018-09-02 09:44:59 Rotten mangoes attract a lot of flies just as cheap commodities attract many buyers! But the most expensive stuff like diamonds n gold are covered deep beneath the earth. You "dig to get them"!
484 2018-09-02 09:39:01 Commodities msee lol I’ll talk to folks about this tbh
485 2018-09-02 09:38:13 Commodities 
486 2018-09-02 09:32:59 Basic commodities prices are going up every day
487 2018-09-02 09:14:54 Kenya is a man eat man society. What will the lower and middle class citizens take to their table if the prices of commodities will be untouchable due to the high fuel prices. We should stand on the ground and oppose this 16% VAT on fuel products @UKenyatta #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
488 2018-09-02 09:14:22 Prices of all most all commodities are about to sky rocket bearing in mind them prices already high. Kenya!
489 2018-09-02 09:08:57 Yes, they are that corrupted and it goes back quite a ways. It’s staggering, actually. Goes back to how she acquired that enormous profit on commodities. Those documents were shredded per a judge. Fact.
490 2018-09-02 08:57:42 Petrol prices all time high, diesel prices record high, lpg Gas all time high. Increase in diesel prices will have cascading effect on prices of other commodities as well. Hope the so called #achhedin get over soon.  #fuelpricehike
491 2018-09-02 08:49:03 So now that prices of basic commodities have doubled tell us what do we do
492 2018-09-02 08:48:05 When a government is getting unpopular, the best to do is to fix the charm. Ask the CS to hike the prices of commodities, then the president intervenes. Bingo. The people cheer and clap
493 2018-09-02 08:47:44 But what happens to other commodities? Unwise move in my view.
494 2018-09-02 08:41:54 Sir pls Agri commodities me bhi kuch margdarshan dijiye
495 2018-09-02 08:41:23 Can you talk to those geniuses you listen to, to reduce the taxes on basic commodities?
496 2018-09-02 08:37:26 It’s a business where it’s commodities are paid very well.
Once that person has reached the end of that teams shelf life it’s time to move on. Happens in lots of sports. Loyalty also has to be a 2 way street
497 2018-09-02 08:36:52 TNVS community leaders report around 30% of their drivers deactivated due to losses, oil price hikes, surge of commodities, etc. | via @kevinmanalo_
498 2018-09-02 08:21:53 That spotlight shined for 15 mins...
Now, there is total darkness...
Delusional, craziness or stupidity are no longer consider commodities..
499 2018-09-02 08:05:04 3207: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
500 2018-09-02 08:05:02 Any direction on the production numbers and locations of any of these commodities will be highly appreciated
501 2018-09-02 08:04:55 Tampons & pads should be free for everyone. Food should be free for everyone. Clean water should be free for everyone. Access to shelter should be free for everyone. Healthcare should be free for everyone. BASIC NECESSITIES SHOULD NOT BE COMMODITIES, and fuck you if you disagree.
502 2018-09-02 08:02:14 my lasting solution would be to introduce the tax gradually this in turn cushions the common mwananchi plus commodities like LPG should not be taxed to ensure we save our forests
503 2018-09-02 08:00:10 Food Chain: producir commodities pensando en la góndolahttp://agriculturers.com/food-chain-producir-commodities-pensando-en-la-gondola/
504 2018-09-02 07:57:48 Prices of necesary commodities will shoot, the poor wont aford them anymore. Pure genius.
505 2018-09-02 07:56:52 No doubt prices of basic commodities have increased over the past month but Basmati rice has always been more expensive than ordinary rice.
506 2018-09-02 07:42:37 Lo tenes que hacer, en medio de una crisis fiscal y cambiaria no te podés dar el lujo de seguir bajándolas, en este contexto no está mal, era lo que había que hacer, en otra situación si sería pésimo. Adicionalmente venden commodities y les subió el dólar cosa que los favorece.
507 2018-09-02 07:41:27 The price of all commodities will shoot with the high fuel  price. It's the mwananchi to feel the pinch.
508 2018-09-02 07:37:42 Kenyans kenyans kenyans,when shall stand for our rights.People are talking about 2022 instead of revisiting the sky rocketting prices of essential commodities like fuels and counterfeit goods.Lets be realistic kenyans.
509 2018-09-02 07:32:44 The commodities are Rice, Maize, High iron beans, Wheat, Sorghum, Millet, Cassava, Sweet Potatoes, Aquaculture, Large and small ruminants, Cotton, Oil Palm, Shea nuts, Soybeans and Cocoa
510 2018-09-02 07:27:13 What are the commodities?
511 2018-09-02 07:24:17 Has there been any analysis of interaction between bots and financial trading bots? Say in commodities? Norilsk Nickel for eg
512 2018-09-02 07:18:59 In a rail car it doesn’t require the added ‘nefarious’ diligent. Additionally, rail can transport a variety of commodities, right?
513 2018-09-02 07:11:32 Sure is weird how countries with large resources that play a large role as input commodities keep needing interventions. Odd coincidence.
514 2018-09-02 06:59:35 They also don’t seem to understand that we really care for the animals and don’t just see them as commodities
515 2018-09-02 06:51:51 Introducing VAT on all commodities even on essential commodities but reduce the rate to 10 % or 12% might result in more consumption and better revenue collection.
516 2018-09-02 06:39:36 Kenyan MPs are bribed to shut up on fuel hike

Rotich should know that, the economy of a Nation can't be enhanced thro increasing commodities price

If GoK wanna promote the economy of this Nation,thy should invest in innovation,Research & technology
#PunguzaBeiYaMafuta
517 2018-09-02 06:35:47 Sir y don't u compare diesel prices. Which is directly impacting all commodities..
In 2014 it was 40 per lit now it's 70 per lit..
518 2018-09-02 06:33:32 Despite rapidly raising of commodities during #Ramaphosa s term, this man is doing amazing things. Slowly but surely. Watch n see.
519 2018-09-02 06:33:17 ...so,...gold is something it is worth because it can be exchanged  easily with other commodities,...this is not to say that fiat money is  based on it, however,....@SMiltim
520 2018-09-02 06:20:14 Tbh Im always so baffled why ppl are so defensive of the kpop label? Youre saying you WANT your faves to be restricted overworked and underpaid? Its an industry that routinely destroys ppls lives and treats human being as commodities to pump for $$$. I PRAY Bts escapes it
521 2018-09-02 06:15:39 Let's make combined effort to include these commodities under purview of GST asap to our respective state governments..
#lowerSalesTax
522 2018-09-02 06:09:09 No,it does not affect all of us please, sisi watu ya jubilee we got the jubilee smartcard and we are using it to buy commodities at a lower price same to fuel as from this week
523 2018-09-02 05:59:54 ..of course..this will drive up the cost of commodities /fares since every raw material and finished goods are transported; add this to the electricity bills as fuel adjustments and BOOM....INFLATION...GENUIS!
524 2018-09-02 05:54:30 nanimalisimo fleekico TheBlockBaron BlockLogicBLTG I’m bullish on Bitcoin and tokenized equity, debt, currency, and commodities

527 2018-09-02 05:41:50 Where can I get these "hard to get pure natural commodities"? :) #Shehed #Zaitoon
528 2018-09-02 05:38:28 When companies are retrenching, closing, prices of basic commodities rising, no jobs
How can one be hopeful?
What will be the source of hope?
Over night business people are the only rejoicing, Delta is facing foreign currency shortages
Maybe money changers are ones smiling
529 2018-09-02 05:07:58 Congress has to come out aggressively against the failures of bjp on the important issue. 1- very high price of essential commodities and petroleum product. Mega corruption. Poor education systems. Poor health service. Unemployment. Failure of law and orde
530 2018-09-02 05:04:00 Wait, what?!? Is he trying to defend slavery? “Well, actually slaves were not treated as commodities like cattle, rather they were treated like horses.”

Seriously, has anyone tried to fight him after class?
531 2018-09-02 04:59:53 I don't really contemplate that rising taxes on such commodities like fuel will orchestrate economic growth but rather it impoverises many Kenyans.
532 2018-09-02 04:57:54 Perfect. Also, he should probably learn that commodities are assets, bless his heart.
533 2018-09-02 04:53:49 disruptions, expected strong dollar, bearish on Oil. Copper,  Silver and other commodities are back to their low, indicating  limited demand for commodities.
534 2018-09-02 04:44:59 Just going to let you all know that literally almost all things in PH are getting more expensive and expensive. And the prices of basic commodities are hiking up... And the problem is that salaries are being constant 
535 2018-09-02 04:40:06 AfAm slaves weren't maintained as assets. Hence the vital need to restart the slave trade. They were used up like commodities.
536 2018-09-02 04:33:46 Actually, I do! He heads and organizes the branding for several very different food commodities.
537 2018-09-02 04:31:14 Tell your daughters titties can and do hang, they aren't inherently sexual and that a nipple through her shirt ain't disrespectful either. Tell her she can give herself a healthy, risk free orgasm, that they aren't commodities and that sex is to be enjoyed. Potatoes gone potate.
538 2018-09-02 04:31:14 Sir, im not an nri to be misinformed i reside in india

Plz prove me wrong about prices of pulses,fuel and other essential commodities are lower than earlier
539 2018-09-02 04:05:52 There are two kind of entrepreneurs
1: those who create
2: those who arbitrage

The former deal in products and thrive, the latter in commodities and eventually perish.
540 2018-09-02 03:59:56 Lo que aumentó en el gobierno de Cristina fue el gasto social, y además hubo una clara merma en el valor de los commodities que exportaba Argentina. Una fuerte emisión, suba de inflación pero sin caída de la actividad, y lamentablemente cepo cambiario.
541 2018-09-02 03:59:03 India was asked to choose between society and economy in 2014. Now they have neither  @ThePrintIndia How life style improved since 2014, veggie, food commodities price nosedived,individual earnings improved r common man concern. Curbing Urban Maos r govt job whether UPA or NDA
542 2018-09-02 03:53:39 Kkkkkk.
Piada 
Esta preso e sua corja está indo junto.
Gastou a melhor fase do país com as "commodities" financiando países comunistas sem crédito e amigos com dinheiro público
543 2018-09-02 03:51:23 Raising tax on commodities will never help pay off debts, it will only avail more funds for the thieves to steal, it will only make life harder for the low income Kenyan
544 2018-09-02 03:49:15 He's  long time commodity analyst, and has a decent pedigree. Having said that, talking $8 corn is extreme, but I do think talking about higher prices shouldn't be "blown off." From a cyclic perspective, there's reason to be bullish commodities in 2019...
545 2018-09-02 03:47:14 Y en esos años no hubo la sequía más importante de los últimos 70 años, los commodities estaban en récord histórico de valor y la tasa libre de riesgo tendiendo a cero. Y los usd? Se los llevaron en bolsos, por eso la devaluacion y cepo. #NoVuelvenMas #YoTeBancoMacri
546 2018-09-02 03:32:27 Intriguing contest that you are taking part in! At times, I think I should focus on less stocks/commodities/leveraged products.
547 2018-09-02 03:26:38 you are misinformed, all seasonal essential commodities are at fair value. Tomatoes are at all time low. Please remember the vegetable, pulses and rice etc has harvesting season and prices vary as per season.
548 2018-09-02 03:23:20 You simply can't have bulk storage of grain commodities without pests. It's like having a commercial kitchen without cockroaches or rodents- it's pretty rare
549 2018-09-02 02:51:02 The first wave started with selling newspapers as commodities in the mid- Nineties. Two decades later, books have followed the same trend. This is what happens when too much of democracy precedes education.
550 2018-09-02 02:45:49 Build the wall....build a.staging area for incoming freight...for train and autos..and other commodities. Have a 30 day wait period...have laws set into place for these guidelines to be followed...only take incoming cargo every third month...SHUT IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!
551 2018-09-02 02:43:51 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
552 2018-09-02 02:32:28 Your young have been sold, with truth they can become people not commodities!
553 2018-09-02 02:26:59 Boom das commodities, dinheiro da China, maioria dos países europeus em crise com os EUA. Tanto o Brasil, quanto os países vizinhos cresceram bastante.
554 2018-09-02 02:23:56 Lo del campo estaba bien.pero gradual (mas rápido trigo y maíz) para todos los commodities.Y no conceder tanto tiempo para la liquidacion de  exportadoras
555 2018-09-02 02:18:37 How could you do that? That's just the commodities, baby.
556 2018-09-02 02:16:49 #ChinaStateVisit Ramaphosa:We want to enhance the people to people relations between Chinese and South Africans. We want to leave with many many Dollars as we go home. Market access is very important to us. We are exporting more & more commodities to China.
557 2018-09-02 02:09:53 This is really a positive note in terms of our positioning in the international stratosphere.
But, we also should think in terms of the pricing of diesel & petrol, which is consistently high & the deciding factor for the ultimate pricing of essential commodities.
558 2018-09-02 02:06:00 When youre out there constantly spending people's whole rent on commodities you bound to drizzown.
559 2018-09-02 02:05:16 No I understand the JD deal. I'm just saying the rebuild is officially on so they need to handle the only 2 commodities they have left much better.
560 2018-09-02 02:05:03 But more taxes on salaried class as usual because the promises made post demonetisaton were not met.. 

Current Govt., right royally hike the prices of even essential commodities likr fuel, milk etc.,
561 2018-09-02 02:01:45 False - China bought futures in Soybeans when it became the apparent USA would not back down from trade negotiations.  China is NOT "turning" to Canada for beans - they purchased USA beans before they hit the market.  Do you know what Commodities are?
562 2018-09-02 01:49:14 IDGAF between the other three. Just not Saquon. Too risky when you have three proven commodities sitting there.
563 2018-09-02 01:47:18 A look at history makes clear that a great number of men are more than happy to do away with women, casually. Truly, not all men, as we know wonderful, beautiful men at times, but dominant behavior in history is rapine, enslavement, and murder of women as objects or commodities.
564 2018-09-02 01:46:19 @realDonaldTrump Mr. president you should fire Fed Chair  Jay Powell and put a person who is more likely cheap guy. Rate hikes and tightening dollar which pushing away visitors in USA and exports issues, world currencies and commodities falling apart. It’s a bad for Americans.
565 2018-09-02 01:42:37 Bueno prestá atención eh. Ni bien asumió Macri quitó las retenciones. Eso aumenta el precio local de los commodities.
Y por qué no funcionó? También les sacó la obligación de ingresar las divisas por las exportaciones.
Entonces?
566 2018-09-02 01:37:54 That's the only way you're going to have friends, by buying them. Unfortunately, they'll only stay through the good times. When shit goes south, they're gone. You know, just the way YOU treat people, like commodities. When they have no more value...gone.
567 2018-09-02 01:31:42 Rare commodities are worth more than good.
568 2018-09-02 01:30:43 People are depressed out here. Life is hard.. Death is becoming easy each day my fren. Akina Uliam na @kipmurkomen wanafanya maisha ya wakenya kuwa ngumu sana. Sai VAT 16% imeongezwa.. Fuel is core in all sectors of the economy.. All commodities will shoot sharply.
569 2018-09-02 01:30:03 The largest marine diesel engines have more than 100,000 horsepower (in comparison, a mid-sized car may have up to 300 horsepower). largest container ships can carry more than 20,000 containers and biggest bulk carriers can carry more than 300,000 tons of commodities (iron ore).
570 2018-09-02 01:29:34 Thanks for posting Disco.  

Thanks to @MichaelWestBiz for supporting these investigations bc "There are few commodities as political as food".  

The more people "watching" the more chance we have collectively at food sovereignty.

#vivalacroquette
571 2018-09-02 01:28:55 So ships have always been the most sustainable way to transport commodities and goods. And ships increasingly becoming even more energy efficient. IMO regulations on energy efficiency support the demand for ever greener and cleaner shipping.
572 2018-09-02 01:17:02 Wow. Men treat women as interchangeable commodities. 
WE ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE.  #FixMyLife
573 2018-09-02 01:10:36 I think of all finance Cs have known Hon Rotich is the worst. As much we need revenue we don't have tax all the commodities like food,water and fuel. These are basic commodities, taxing them ave a triple effect we are destroying not growing our economy.
574 2018-09-02 00:59:03 I empathize with the savings drains but this really has nothing to do with crypto. It has much more to do with trading itself, and people don’t know how to trade properly. They might as well buy options or commodities & hope for a rise.
575 2018-09-02 00:56:08 That's OK Ur Excellency President Uhuru,but who are responsible for all this illegality also should be held accountable. Introducing tax on fuel will affect all the prices commodities that will be transport and that affecting the economy negatively.
576 2018-09-02 00:46:42 considerable aid, including money, fuel, fertilizer and various other commodities.  Enjoy. Our country is doing great!
577 2018-09-02 00:14:23 Vocês também :  não passam de um bando de canalhas antidemocratas que há décadas TEM SOBREVIVIDO DAS COMMODITIES do Brasil MANTENDO O POVO NA MISÉRIA enquanto CORROMPEM instituições como o Judiciário do @STF_oficial até MORO principalmente enquanto SONEGAM  MILHÕES EM IMPOSTOS
578 2018-09-02 00:12:47 Coz trust and happiness are both expensive commodities.

Thing is when I am with you, 
you can get it for free.
579 2018-09-02 00:06:58 And commodities - the whole point of the article is - careful and look beyond labels
580 2018-09-02 00:05:42 Vocês não passam de um bando de canalhas antidemocratas que há décadas TEM SOBREVIVIDO DAS COMMODITIES do Brasil MANTENDO O POVO NA MISÉRIA enquanto CORROMPEM instituições como o Judiciário do @STF_oficial até MORO principalmente enquanto SONEGAM CENTENAS DE MILHÕES EM IMPOSTOS
581 2018-08-31 23:58:41 It's a little frustrating to see you preface that you are comparing "irrational 5th wave extensions/moves" and yet everyone is stating the obvious difference between the two commodities... Thanks for sharing your specific thoughts on 5th waves 
582 2018-08-31 23:52:39 It’s an area you can’t go into lightly, and you haven’t. I avoid it unless it’s major news, like now. I prefer covering free market commodities. They’re all about S + D. SM is all about regulations
583 2018-08-31 23:50:22 Melhor assim, dessa vez o 9 dedos pode não ter a sorte que teve com as commodities! E mesmo com a sorte, deu no que deu! 
E esse papinho da ONU já está manjada!
584 2018-08-31 23:34:30 After ni bei ya stima, next ni ya basic commodities kuvuta bangi (go )
585 2018-08-31 23:33:06 Commodities aren't rights
586 2018-08-31 23:32:31 You mean feminism, aboriginal rights, and environmental protections as priorities? That's obviously much more important than auto sector jobs and selling commodities?
587 2018-08-31 23:27:16 So if you check the average inflation on food commodities for example, you will get my point.
588 2018-08-31 23:23:35 I can tell you what treasury bonds are worth. I don’t think commodities are especially good store of values - but still far more predictable, stable than cryptos!
589 2018-08-31 23:21:28 Negative ghost rider. I don’t give resources for commodities I know also suck.
590 2018-08-31 23:11:59 It's preseason. I'm not worried about Davis, and anzalone it's health. Both are easily and by far our best. Craig is in the running for 3rd. Personally I do t care about preseason ranking of known commodities.

598 2018-08-31 23:58:41 It's a little frustrating to see you preface that you are comparing "irrational 5th wave extensions/moves" and yet everyone is stating the obvious difference between the two commodities... Thanks for sharing your specific thoughts on 5th waves 
599 2018-08-31 23:52:39 It’s an area you can’t go into lightly, and you haven’t. I avoid it unless it’s major news, like now. I prefer covering free market commodities. They’re all about S + D. SM is all about regulations

602 2018-08-31 23:33:06 Commodities aren't rights
603 2018-08-31 23:32:31 You mean feminism, aboriginal rights, and environmental protections as priorities? That's obviously much more important than auto sector jobs and selling commodities?
604 2018-08-31 23:27:16 So if you check the average inflation on food commodities for example, you will get my point.
605 2018-08-31 23:23:35 I can tell you what treasury bonds are worth. I don’t think commodities are especially good store of values - but still far more predictable, stable than cryptos!
606 2018-08-31 23:21:28 Negative ghost rider. I don’t give resources for commodities I know also suck.
607 2018-08-31 23:11:59 It's preseason. I'm not worried about Davis, and anzalone it's health. Both are easily and by far our best. Craig is in the running for 3rd. Personally I do t care about preseason ranking of known commodities.

615 2018-08-31 22:21:40 Sorry Twitterverse for the BS sunglass ads..I haven’t actually gone into the discount sunglass biz (I suppose as commodities go it could have been worse!)
616 2018-08-31 22:09:21 are subsidised by their countries and are putting our farmers out of business who are much more competitive then them even now (if they don,t get subsidy from their own govt). Similarly, the same principal can be applied to thousands of commodities. it will give govt more.....
617 2018-08-31 22:08:15 Real wages are declining and Trump’s tariffs will only exacerbate this by increasing the cost of commodities. The lack of coherent economic policies encourages trade partners to look elsewhere. Just look at farmers now. Trump is subsidizing them bc of he doesn’t understand trade.
618 2018-08-31 22:00:16 in fuel prices. on the other hand if countries were given a free hand in levying any amount  of duties on imported goods then they can get a lot of revenue from import duties and would put lesser pressure on sensitive commodities like petrol. although cerain imported goods ....
619 2018-08-31 21:58:33 Oil picture is supply/demand driven unlike many strategic commodities. You can't print it with a new 3D printer & all the calls of "Lower for Longer" & "Peak Demand" are a FAIL. Do you really think we can cut upstream spending by 40% for 3 years & still produce a surplus of oil?
620 2018-08-31 21:57:58 countries who had entered into WTO Treaty cannot enhance rates on imported goods and are forced to collect revenue on sensitive commodities like crude oil which leads to overall inflation. so everybody suffers (moreso poor people)since almost everybody gets hit by increase ....
621 2018-08-31 21:51:38 You obviously are not grasping what I'm saying. We'll negotiate Moore trade deals with them. 2/3 of our commodities Just opened up
622 2018-08-31 21:47:43 Now indifferent to his SUPPORTERS TRUMP is allowing those WALL ST. THIEVES in bed with HFTs like VIRTU PARTNERS of BELGRADE YUGO. to raise gas/heating oil/commodities et al at the CCM.

630 2018-08-31 21:05:46 The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivativemarkets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller profit margins.

636 2018-08-31 20:45:17 Hey Man first of all, I love your work! And second I was wondering if you have considered adding most mentioned commodities as part of your site? Then you could choose between companies and commodities. Just an idea, I have no clue how much work it would take. Thanks again!
637 2018-08-31 20:41:58 Children are not commodities. Adults don't get to "acquire" children like desired merchandise. What matters is fulfilling kids' needs NOT adults' wants.

Kids need mom and dad. Giving BOTH to kids is love: doing what is best for kids, not for adopting adults.

641 2018-08-31 20:33:19 2.  Processors & retailers, in most instances, cannot procure farm commodities directly from consumers - you have to go through government-sanctioned board that decide what you’ll pay and where you’ll get your commodity.
642 2018-08-31 20:32:50 Commodities already at record compared to S&P so not sure I agree that you see them fall along with oil & USD.  Seems like everyone is sure commodities sell off as paper money loses value.  I guess i should have gone to college & got that MBA.
643 2018-08-31 20:32:03 1. Canadian agriculture is very different than US agriculture in many ways.  First, most of Canadian (and, some US) agriculture was excluded from NAFTA (see: Dairy, but nearly all other commodities, including poultry and vegetables).
644 2018-08-31 20:27:31 Short selling commodities is not for sissies - Barton Biggs
645 2018-08-31 20:22:37 I think it's the other way around. US $ has been commoditised/fixed via tripartite prepay to US oil reserves #OilStandard If I were China (+ Asia buyer club) I'd hold buy-side LME ring-style forward physical auctions. Oil & dollar will fall together & commodities will follow
646 2018-08-31 20:14:59 Commodities & Renewable Energy Tech for me too. AI & Quantum computer will be massive in 10 years.

700 2018-08-31 17:57:31 This is due to stock buy backs, capital spending (which is good) & extra foreign spending on commodities due to tariffs. Unfortunately, most economist, believe the tariffs will kick in next Q and will be bad. Lets be reminded that 4-5% Qs are not uncommon in the last 10years

710 2018-08-31 17:35:28 Falso, los commodities no siguen al dólar. Una apreciación del dólar, gralmente baja su cotización, porque juega oferta, demanda, stocks, etc. Es lo que pasa ahora en soja. El precio más bajo en 10 años. El campo es bien de capital, no insumo. Estudio, Master europa, vos?
711 2018-08-31 17:35:04 Yeah but when you lose the Rule of Law which we have in our financial system it's coming off the rails. Something as simple as reinstating the Uptick Rule could stop it. They knew what they were doing when they repealed Glass-Steagall & Uptick Rule. HFT war on commodities ongoing
712 2018-08-31 17:33:55 And why does most of the world keep USD treasuries & dollar reserves? Why are most commodities priced in USD especially oil, in the first place?
713 2018-08-31 17:31:04 Deja de drogarte ! Tenemos el Déficit fiscal más alto de la historia , endeudaron hasta mis tataranietos , desaprovecharon el boom de los commodities y todos los días hay gente que queda por el camino . No repitas más estupideces ! Estás Gaga!

733 2018-08-31 16:46:00 Hi mcx team,
I am a salaried person how can I invest and trade in metals and commodities with you .
734 2018-08-31 16:45:36 Sem contar a oportunidade única que perdemos na alta das commodities no final dos anos 2000, quando entrou dólar de “rodo” no país e o que fizeram foi gastar tudo em estádios de futebol e não em educação.
735 2018-08-31 16:41:11 So feel free to keep patting yourself on the back while socially responsible commodities don't get developed in favour of entirely irresponsible sources of the same. Also, they still routinely burn tires for heat and power source in Mongolia.
736 2018-08-31 16:39:03 Agree & disagree. I agree we need to stand up to the US, BUT the remark that we can trade with the rest of the world ... not really. We cannot trade internally, nor build infrastructure to move our most valuable commodities. Lets scrap Supply management and not budge on chap 19
737 2018-08-31 16:38:55 It's because of demodinomics nature of Indian economy when PM declared demonetisation. After 500+ days of waiting we realized that all the prices for Indian commodities are less for those who are residing outside India including our PM, because of our devaluated INR.
738 2018-08-31 16:28:25 The commoditization of sex is pretty much a fait accompli and as with all commodities, since quality is interchangeable the only thing that counts is the price. 

Kind of like flying economy.

748 2018-08-31 15:52:23 The prices of commodities raises because of increase of fuel prices and that increase in prices is to be borne by the  people and have direct impact on their income.  No attempts are being made by government to control the same
749 2018-08-31 15:41:44 May be its bcoz the GDP is now calculated at "Market Price" rather than "Factor Cost" when the Prices of commodities are anyways high then it was suspected that GDP will anyways be high. Also shows Indians have very deep pockets...
750 2018-08-31 15:39:39 Lol I’m assuming they get mad because of speculation like this  however, cutting you a bit of a break because a lot of these guys were behind seniors last year and are unproven commodities. Don’t worry, you’ll find out tonight

755 2018-08-31 15:16:24 Uds recibieron más dólares de deuda que el ingreso extra por el precio de los commodities. ¿Qué uso le dieron?
756 2018-08-31 15:14:01 I 100% support the decriminalization of sex workers. It would give them much more control and safety. However - I do not see how it would change the view men hold of these women as commodities for their pleasure. That may never change, but we should be honest about it.
757 2018-08-31 15:13:19 I used to be of this opinion, but now I believe that one should understand the macro as it relates to the investment. eg you cannot ignore China and the linkages to its macro if you are taking a call on commodities like chemicals, steel, paper, etc

762 2018-08-31 14:48:05 por otra parte, las empresas que comercian commodities (cerealeras, petroleras), y pagan sueldos en pesos son los que están haciendo una diferencia que nadie mira.

764 2018-08-31 14:37:15 Angus Reid did a poll. Of the 4% of Canadians who say they have a good understanding if supply management, only half of them even know what commodities operate under the program. So I see your 90% and raise to 98% of Canadians don't understand what supply management is.

777 2018-08-31 13:50:53 Indeed, specialization in commodities exports seldom promotes sustained and inclusive economic growth, not only because of the volatility of commodities prices on the international market but also because of the low value-added resulting from the lack of local processing 3/7
778 2018-08-31 13:48:28 However, Africa remains a net importer of all kinds of products and at the same time, the exports of raws materials remain the most important link to the global economy for many African countries, so the economy of the region is heavily dependent on exports of commodities 2/7

796 2018-08-31 12:31:58 Because the collapse in the value of Sterling the day after the vote meant imported goods and commodities cost more and drove inflation up higher than wage rises.

811 2018-08-31 11:34:34 BTC is a commodity.. FMG produces commodities, cant base a market comparison on a company that in 2009 was making hundreds of millions of profit due to high ore prices, they also produce uranian and many other commodities. It's comparing apples with oranges.
812 2018-08-31 11:33:48 The Millennials and Gen Z are creating a new wave for Real Estate. Affordability is the biggest stumbling block. Condos and town homes will become hot commodities. If you are buying, use this criteria- location first, then size and then amenities.

815 2018-08-31 11:24:21 Aun cuando #MacriYoTeBanco, para mitigar el impacto de esta corrida del dolar, no veria tan mal colocar retenciones del 10% a las exportaciones de commodities, con fecha de caducidad en Septiembre de 2019, con posibilidad de adelantarla si se estabiliza la situacion antes
816 2018-08-31 11:17:32 As you get started today, what’s on your mind about the commodities? Drop us a question for this week’s discussion.
817 2018-08-31 11:13:05 Im much better at trading Commodities and Stocks compared to Forex
818 2018-08-31 11:10:19 Is it just the openness of the economy that matters, or the nature of exports too? Argentina exports more basic commodities rather than manufactured goods? Something more domestic value added adjusted may work better or is it accounted for?
819 2018-08-31 10:58:59 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
820 2018-08-31 10:50:15 #petrolprice all time high #Dollar against #Rupee all time high . #BJP calculating reason of @RahulGandhi going through #china to #Kailashmansavover . No political parties are interested of common issues of price hike in all commodities . Only politics is India's destiny.
821 2018-08-31 10:42:31 You don’t need to defend Lifeless Buhari 

You don’t need to prove that @OfficialAPCNg government is working 

You just need to take the prices of commodities to where it was before, if you cannot do it better.
822 2018-08-31 10:41:38 The ag references to the Maggie at Fidelity are most likely intentional and tie to a Margin and Margie variation with a Paul and to to Margaret Ganesha with yoga and to commodities references and a Michael.

825 2018-08-31 10:35:13 While the sell-off appeared overdone this summer speculators may take a slightly cautious view to commodities over the next few weeks till demand growth is better determined.
826 2018-08-31 10:35:08 Reality is returning to commodities with buying earlier this week lifting depressed prices though the impact of Trump’s hard line on tariffs has yet to be fully determined
827 2018-08-31 10:33:59 Question for investors is which way will commodities fall as markets adjust to Trump’s new global order.
Trump with all his crazy rhetoric appears to be simply enacting ‘Republican’ policies albeit in a rather tough manner
828 2018-08-31 10:10:52 Basic commodities are ever special. Touching on them signals a number of potential circumstances.For once,though temporarily,the MNAs have been sensitive to the welfare of Kenyans.
829 2018-08-31 10:05:24 Hitler was not a small government conservative. His gov controlled all the commodities and the means of production. He was a socialist. So was Stalin and Mao. Great examples of socialism. I am bowing to your “superior intellect”.
830 2018-08-31 09:43:00 40% export still in the form of raw commodities. But, Government already invest heavily on infrastructure, etc so that raw commodities can be processed into more value added goods before export. Also, we hv strong domestic demand due to young demography w/ increasing middle class
831 2018-08-31 09:35:59 Difficult environment. Not satisfied with my performance. Core performance still very good but nasty political motivated outliers (soft commodities, currencies, China) cost a lot, i.e. flat since three months or in other words working for free.
832 2018-08-31 09:30:07 Procede de ver cosas como un analista de Citi diciendo que los drillers offshore eran la cosa más "overvalued" que cubría 

Y me cuadra bastante porque los informes de Commodities de ese banco son de lo peor (o quizá sean idiotas, navaja de ockham).
833 2018-08-31 09:16:35 What has this changed in Nigeria? Until the actions of the president reflect people's expectations, nothing can be classified good of this president. President of forgery is not corruption. Let there be changes in the prices of local commodities in d market.

839 2018-08-31 08:46:10 Hahaha,  Philippines is more of an oligarchy not a democracy !!!!  most Filipinos are selling their votes right?  Who's controlling the price of our commodities?   Who's controlling media?  Gising pinoy
840 2018-08-31 08:42:47 I’m no expert but I’d think commodities who’s supplies cannot be easily increased would be the more sound place to store wealth. Land, precious metals. A big question is if people will choose crypto for this role in an environment where fiat currencies are losing value fast.
841 2018-08-31 08:41:21 True. We should start having conversation around transforming agriculture to agribusiness. Working on our commodities markets, supply chain sustainable farming, et al.
842 2018-08-31 08:34:01 The framework provides UK public sector organisations with a way to buy cloud-based services as commodities to accelerate cloud adoption in a timely and cost-effective manner.
843 2018-08-31 08:23:55 Taming rising prices on basic commodities will be good for the Philippine economy and for the majority of the Filipino people, who are poor. It will bring the prices down and this what the Government should do. It must present concrete and long-lasting solutions as to how it
844 2018-08-31 08:16:02 Totally agree. Duterte should focus on key issues affecting the nation like the increasing prices of basic commodities, goods, services, and other social and economic issues. Instead of making false accusations, attacks against the church and giving out rape jokes!

846 2018-08-31 08:08:15 you pretty much said it.I agree with you just fact that USD is the reserve currency of most nations speaks of the strength it has. Not even to mention commodities and commodities move the world. Remember when Saddam tried to use the euro to exchange for oil, that didn't age well.

861 2018-08-31 07:06:52 In preparation for the projected time frame, I am of the view that the agricultural sector should shift focus into identifying, breeding and promoting value chains of agricultural commodities that are more suitable for the anticipated climatic conditions at the time.#FAO #ARC

872 2018-08-31 05:50:31 Not so much.

890 2018-08-31 02:46:40 Productive capacity of the economy is nil to limited due to concentration in commodities, brain drain, civil unrest, etc. so attempts to spur economic activity through money printing results in inflation since provision of goods and services cannot increase.

892 2018-08-31 02:40:06 They have done a lot on that front. Some of the commodities they ship could alternatively be sent by road; only petroleum can be moved by rail, road or pipeline. Moving oil off rail into pipelines is the equivalent of rail capacity growth.
893 2018-08-31 02:34:23 E o lulopetismo não destruiu o Brasil. Os anos Lula foram os mais prósperos desde a redemocratização. O problema dos governos petistas foi não se preparar para o caso de o preço das commodities despencarem. Quando isso aconteceu, a crise nos atingiu em cheio.
894 2018-08-31 02:31:18 That's 100% backwards. The market makes commodities cheaper. That's a known fact... but also it's convenient when you don't have to create or research many of the technologies you use to treat patients.
895 2018-08-31 02:25:05 "You can't boycott everyone" is really not a very well thought-out response to a principled and justified boycott of any one particular company.

I mean, boycotts may not work, but that's because hate and ignorance are fungible commodities, not because In-N-Out deserves a pass.

904 2018-08-31 01:58:44 Regarding Australia (AUD), energy and mining are responsive to both expectations of Chinese stimulus measures and imports of these domestically produced commodities.  When USD strengthens, oil becomes more expensive and the AUD energy market more attractive.
905 2018-08-31 01:55:17 You list international treaties? Your rights in America come from the Constitution. Healthcare, housing and food are not rights. They are commodities that you need to pay for in order to get them. You have the right to access these things, but they aren't free.
906 2018-08-31 01:54:43 Well, kinda same thing as today. Years of bad trade decisions prior to now has led to the point that Trumps trying to reset and get other trade issues worked out. Ag commodities happened to be first strike for the chicoms mainly because it looked to hurt the most.

911 2018-08-31 01:13:32 Lula não fez nada amigo.. nada x nada. um populista de merda, que pegou o Brasil no melhor momento das commodities. qualquer um que estivesse no poder , até um mendigo no lugar do Lula conseguiria fazer melhor.. Mas o Lula não, ele quis se aproveitar e SAQUERAR o País.
912 2018-08-31 01:07:49 TV Pundits are market commodities.  Everyone is working on their, “brand.”  Whether it’s MSNBC or Fox News, they are engaged in a symbiotic relationship that is a single phenomenon. They each give the other the ammunition to reinforce their own brand.
913 2018-08-31 00:57:38 Don't know how people are able to watch college football today, when the @NCAA just proved for the umpteenth time that college athletes are nothing more than monetizable commodities that will never be protected off the field.

921 2018-08-31 00:30:29 Keep up. Many countries have refineries and other plants that process raw commodities. These creat many long-term jobs.  A pipeline doesn't.
