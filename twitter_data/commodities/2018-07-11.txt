17 2018-07-11 23:17:03 There's exchanges like the stock market(nyse, nasdaq) where you buy or sell things in the future because you expect the price to be lower or higher. People mostly do it with commodities like soy beans or gas. Btw be wary of people who claim u can "get rich quick" or huge profits.

40 2018-07-11 23:10:27 When you have a shit-ton surplus of cheap grain for @Russia to make vodka, who gives a shit?! Nat gas & oil is Vital NatSec commodities. @USAFacts #LameComeback
41 2018-07-11 23:08:08 Stronger $USD has sent $AUD, Oil, Gold, and base metal commodities in retreat today (all measured in $USD of course). Foreign investment from the US has been seen in June for the first time in a long time. Expect more in our financials.
42 2018-07-11 23:05:00 my developing zygote just took two commodities, a coat and 10 yards of linen, and let the former be double the value of the latter. I’m so proud omg
43 2018-07-11 23:02:21 Either the economy is growing & commodities will be in strong demand or we are entering a recession just like in 2008. Have to think that if a weak USD brought global growth, then a strong USD will bring global recession. Stocks don't stand a chance in this environment #GotGold?
44 2018-07-11 22:59:58 Democracy is the new Dictatorship. Protects our families by Murdering families in foriegn countries for profit,  and many of our kids futures are a future of High tax and a life of struggle so the rich can get Richer.  They are Commodities to you. Tell the truth.
45 2018-07-11 22:59:33 TCR esta en niveles “normales” (promedio historico 20 años excluyendo picos de las crisis) + commodities están OK. Ya bastante subsidios hay entre planes sociales, energía y transporte +evasión laboral, para justificar más impuestos. Se necesitan USD de Xs.
46 2018-07-11 22:57:39 If I had a big margin account, I would have shorted soy beans months ago. They’re down $1.50/bushel and dropping more. Shorting commodities right now is making some people a fortune. Now Congress is stepping in. #Trump doesn’t understand what he’s doing. Their words.
47 2018-07-11 22:56:01 The rising tide will sink some of our neighbors’ ships. The surge in property values is great for some property owners but will stress a lot of family budgets. Please re-think using “urban pioneer” it hints of colonialism. Community > commodities.
48 2018-07-11 22:55:29 #Trump talks about the stock market and the economy but he never mentions commodities. Corn, wheat, Soy, etc. They are all down BIG across the board and those are assets that once you lose them, their gone. Soy beans go bad if you can’t sell them.
49 2018-07-11 22:55:18 Sim esta. As empresas de commodities e estatal puxa o p/bv p baixo pelo peso dos books

51 2018-07-11 22:48:33 Let’s hope it delivers. I have my doubts with this trade rhetoric. Technicals don’t matter in commodities only headlines right now.
52 2018-07-11 22:46:55 I remember my family getting commodities when I was little.
53 2018-07-11 22:46:40 Sorry, @SenatorRounds, you can’t have your SCOTUS picks and your commodities too. Now go tell your forgotten constituents that they have to suck it up & take one for the team. Man does not live on on corn, soybeans, and wheat alone but if we did @realDonaldTrump still don’t GAF!
54 2018-07-11 22:46:32 What George Orwell (1984) got wrong is that Human ingenuity would conquer the police state. As privacy and freedom become more valuable commodities, new ways to achieve them will continuously be created.
55 2018-07-11 22:44:51 Commodities got smoked today. Smoked. 
$USO $GSG $DBA $DBC
56 2018-07-11 22:43:54 No es ningún misterio, es cómo funciona. Los commodities se cobran por “precio pizarra” ya tiene descontado la retención. Es como si nose, vendes medias. Tus medias valen 12 pero el comprador te pga 12 menos la retención. Ahí no hay ganancia, si ese año por ejemplo
57 2018-07-11 22:42:59 The majority of production in China is not in private hands? Commodities produced by workers with nothing but labor power to sell, for bosses who compete with each other, is not dominant in society? The state is not represented by literal millionaire members?

What system is it?
58 2018-07-11 22:40:20 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
59 2018-07-11 22:39:50 There are 15,000+ commodities now tariffed by the EU. Up from about 13,000 18 months ago.
60 2018-07-11 22:39:32 You're all over the place if you were truly a commodities trader you want to be such a fan of trump's
Again being part owner in a large farm coop is different from really being a farmer 
I have better things to do now good night
61 2018-07-11 22:36:59 Give me ten page report on how Trump is selling out our country. Today was fun watching Trump shove it right up Putin's ass. The only thing Russia has is oil and natural gas. So today The Donald told other nations not to buy these commodities from Russia.
62 2018-07-11 22:29:22 Nor are they commodities for zealots looking to pack the pews. So many kids need homes and there aren't enough "proper" couples to take them. Would Jesus let them languish in foster care, or would he come down on the side of love?
63 2018-07-11 22:26:33 A child is not mature enough to choose wisely. I trust you know something of childhood development. No, two parents of the same sex opens a whole new set of confusions for a child to be forced to deal with. They're not commodities to make gays happy.
64 2018-07-11 22:23:50 Commodities are a zero sums game. For every buyer there is a seller. You take away someone who wants to sell then who will buy?
65 2018-07-11 22:20:28 what they grow in the midwest is not food. They grow commodities which are sold, shipped elsewhere, broken down into constituent parts and used to make food-like substances
66 2018-07-11 22:12:58 What recklessness Bonnie ?  Give just one fact ?  And take a basic economics course so you understand pricing of commodities.
67 2018-07-11 22:12:54 Study your history Mr. Trump. For the entire Cold War, the USA traded with the old USSR. It was primarily commodities, including oil, and the USA paid $ billions into USSR's coffers.  And that was during a time when the USA and USSR were formal enemies. The Cold War is over now.
68 2018-07-11 22:12:47 You know we are still in the EU?
You know we'll always be in Europe?
You know this is commodities tacky and lacks all class?
Even as a remainer I know it is this attitude that made people vote leave.
69 2018-07-11 22:11:44 We really need one of our NWO's to represent Ole Miss! I mean let's face it the NWO's are hot commodities.
70 2018-07-11 22:07:58 Commodities: hard and soft I guess
71 2018-07-11 22:05:00 where do we trade in commodities for a low/lowest fee with high/highest UX?
Can you tell me about int'l trading tax laws in commodities, since my $crypto bouts never taght me?
thanks-alot
72 2018-07-11 22:04:44 Was having a discussion with a close friend about animal captivity and I realized something while doing so. Before I state my opinion, just know I think it’s 100% okay to be anti-zoo as I’ve seen my fair share of zoos and facilities where animals are treated as just commodities
73 2018-07-11 22:02:14 China é a segunda maior potência comercial do planeta e depende de segurança alimentar do Brasil e o Brasil depende de commodities e tecnologia sensível da China;
Ciro foi discutir preferências comerciais, apenas isso. Ignorar China e o BRICS é a maior estupidez que podem fazer.
74 2018-07-11 21:53:38 Y dentro de todo a Paraguay entra cualquier cosa luego. Qué lo que pueden vendernos que ya no nos venden. No tenemos gran base industrial. Con poder venderles mucho más commodities y alguna que otra cosita, por ahí sacamos un plus

78 2018-07-11 21:47:25 CME down today? Oh god... today our Indian commodities exchange is down for several trading hours.
79 2018-07-11 21:44:25 Soybeans and other commodities have lost billions in value due the Republican Govt. you Republicans in Congress have screwed us out of health Care and now farmers will be joking the rest of us. If you expect to win in 2018 forget it.
80 2018-07-11 21:41:57 Also, remember, commodities have feelings too.
81 2018-07-11 21:41:20 Well, we're sure seeing the worst.  Isolation from our allies, bullying allies.  Trade war, tariffs to drive up prices. Destruction of health care, rising premiums.  Higher gas prices, commodities more expensive. Allowing election hacking by Russia.  Loss of business to overseas.
82 2018-07-11 21:39:48 They`v manipulated demand for years now. So everything has to come way down. Especially commodities! IMO  : ]
83 2018-07-11 21:33:10 By Friday, I will write a blog about the hot commodities on the trade market heading into the MLB Non-Waiver Trade Deadline.
84 2018-07-11 21:29:21 If no one wants labor then no product gets made. This isn’t hard to grasp. All commodities/products derive their value from socially necessary labor. As in if you want a crab cake then you gotta get the ingredients and cook it yourself.
85 2018-07-11 21:22:35 Prices received for farm commodities by states and prices paid for production items by region and the U.S., past year and earlier years.  The graph I provided clearly shows, in most years the price paid for production was over the price received.
86 2018-07-11 21:22:11 You are thinking of it in terms of commodities. I'm thinking of it in terms of inherent goodness.
87 2018-07-11 21:18:28 There you go on about body's "value" again. People bodies are not commodities.
88 2018-07-11 21:14:29 The latest proposed list of #tariffs on Chinese goods targets minerals like #graphite and #cobalt w/#technology, other industrial applications. Tariffs do not directly target related assembled products, but would raise costs of key inputs. #SupplyChain #Commodities #TradeWar
89 2018-07-11 21:13:46 So why do they hold them in detention centres making millions of dollars for the rich from tax payers why not send them back within 48hrs..human beings are commodities to neocons and vulture capitalist, there's money to be made out of suffering it's repulsive.
90 2018-07-11 21:06:38 weve been here 3 weeks and my parents still expect philippine commodities in the states like bro come on
91 2018-07-11 21:05:20 Ocurrió lo mismo testeando la resistencia de los 70 $ en Enero, nos fuimos directos a los 62 $. Desde luego hay unos pocos haciéndose de oro con los cortos del #brent en estos retrocesos.  #commodities #trading
92 2018-07-11 21:01:05 China’s new exports - today's market action, commodities first, next....

By the end of it they will be in surplus
93 2018-07-11 20:59:16 If the whole world is downgrading their growth outlook on #basemetals #commodities, #oil is not immune. Yet everyone is long, hmmm.. #Crude -12.633MM, yet rally did not hold. Demand 9.2 and 3.8 was down on the weak. Everyone looking at supply but not demand!! #oott $wti $bno
94 2018-07-11 20:57:22 My farm is 300 km from there. 
This trade war is bad for all. What is on the Trump mind? Or someone is doing a inside trading? On commodities, and

97 2018-07-11 20:41:50 Ah fuck it, the final's at Wembley in 2yrs, if we're vigilant and train hard we can probably almost get to that too, trashing stores and ambulances and other commodities along the way.

98 2018-07-11 20:35:06 You really don't get what I'm saying. I said LN is not custodial in that it can't confiscate funds, but it is an IOU system. Maybe it's quasi-custodial. It's a grey area. Just like it's grey area whether cryptos are commodities or currencies. Or if utility tokes are securities.
99 2018-07-11 20:34:05 Zoom out. Commodities are poised to rally this year
100 2018-07-11 20:32:01 I think it points to fundamental types of world views. I bet there are as many people who believe all existing services/products are inherently commodities owned by The Man as people who believe only Randian ubermench's can deliver any value at all.
101 2018-07-11 20:25:23 Actually, I greatly beg to differ.
The digital era IS the new DNA that will power everything moving forward.  Sure, certain tech (as matures to automated self integration) will become standard interchangeable commodities, but SW is THE most profitable (no COGS) & pervasive field
102 2018-07-11 20:16:41 It kinda feels like #grain market fundamentals are irrelevant here as the washout continues for Ags and commodities #wheat #corn #soybeans
103 2018-07-11 20:15:47 Casi la mitad de nuestras exportaciones es Cu o relacionados. Fin de la historia. Producimos commodities con valor agregado que luego importamos en forma de bienes de consumo final, esa es la realidad actual chilena que lentamente va cambiando, pero aun es asi.
104 2018-07-11 20:10:34 I agree but nothing is weighing on the Midwest more than commodities at this point.  SCOTUS, Russians, NK, 2nd Amend, Abortion, none of them"trump" trade.
105 2018-07-11 20:10:00 most of that weakness in soy beans was due to USD ripping over that same time frame I would imagine... beans were at lows along with all commodities.  Now they are off as Chinese retaliate to Trumps tariffs.
106 2018-07-11 20:09:14 Tariffs cost-push so short term inflationary/long term deflationary right? Traders now are SO preemptive that demand destruction doesn't even have to form for the markets to see it on the horizon and fwd price commodities accordingly.

110 2018-07-11 19:39:07 Falls in Commodities & oils tremor ripples into commodity stocks. Mkts trying to estimate Trumps Trade & Tariff Turbulence. Cld give us a healthy sector shake out in commodities. Next weeks US Corp releases will give us a greater forward view.
111 2018-07-11 19:34:30 Was that a #commodities bull I just saw on the ledge getting ready to jump?
112 2018-07-11 19:29:00 The free market law of supply and demand regulate the price of commodities . When governments get involved thing can only go wrong . You do not know more than the market does .
113 2018-07-11 19:22:11 The funny part is Trinidad tried socialism.. went into debt, privatized state commodities, Indian and Chinese ppl own more corporations that black ppl in a predominately black country.

Smdh.
114 2018-07-11 19:09:00 So what is the explanation that we go to China for money for our debt and Germany goes for 20 per cent for energy. Different commodities but same principle. This is not a slush fund in control of the US. This alliance is defense spending in Europe. We don’t control it.
115 2018-07-11 19:00:11 So #sexism in the #BBC is slowly being ended.Some #men are paid less & #women more.#equality is now a #commodity:#commodities are #finite. When we are all #equal, we will #ALL have #less.
116 2018-07-11 18:57:05 This happened in Indian commodities market 4 times today itself before us markets opened, had being at us open, panic, havoc and what not.
117 2018-07-11 18:53:38 Some massive moves in commodities and FX today. Yet equities are basically chill because 2 NQ names never wanted to drop.

119 2018-07-11 18:41:56 CHINESE Debt and Loans - Chinese use equities and commodities, such as Copper, as Collaterial for Loans, in some cases the same collateral is pledeged several times. As prices fall for equities and commodities such as copper they are forced to sell and sell. Lots of ??? on Debt
120 2018-07-11 18:40:54 Can the Chinese easily switch away from soy is also the question? I agree with Matt it is very hard to sanction commodities.
121 2018-07-11 18:40:24 Big risk off day and it is starting to hit bonds - but I am still struck by oil down 5% and stocks and commodities all looking awful and bonds are still only off by 3bps

"The jurisdictional authority of CFTC to regulate virtual currencies as commodities does not preclude other agencies from exercising their regulatory power when virtual currencies function differently than derivative commodities."
123 2018-07-11 18:34:15 From what I’ve observed thus far. The brunt of the burden in the trade war is being carried almost exclusively by farmers as Ag commodities are about all we sell to the Chinese. 

Interestingly, the farmers seem oddly optimistic about this.

127 2018-07-11 18:28:06 I believe they're referring to counter tariffs that will no doubt increase the cost of commodities used in products by manufacturers, which will likely be passed on to US consumers. Supply & Demand.

183 2018-07-11 16:07:09 For 1000s of yrs, Precious Metals were the best monetary investment. After the gold standard ended in 1971, Central bank derivatives destroyed their ability to hedge inflation. Following #Bitcoin's 2017 scaling debate victory, they have been relegated to mere commodities.

356 2018-07-11 05:36:13 Free market capitalism is the fairest system in the world. Those that are most efficient survive and succeed. It’s this inequality that creates winners and losers and guarantees commodities at the best price for consumers.

363 2018-07-11 05:27:11 Ya Nervana, this is better than dealing with women as commodities as the case of Nuseiries do, now as far as the re-twitter Joshua, ask your wife about this, she will explain about passing through a hole as Nuseiries do ....!!!!

365 2018-07-11 05:12:31 Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, CTPA, 96 crime bill, welfare reform bill, were all very meaningful to Democrats benefactors.
366 2018-07-11 05:12:26 A nice PR for Dangote, Africas richest man & worlds 100th richest. Riches made from trading & production of commodities- non-speculative business that have fetched him billions
367 2018-07-11 05:04:38 I like to think it was just a matter of bodies and beds , but I believe its a matter of greed and commodities. The Ramada Inn doesn't stay open if the beds are empty. No difference then judges sending kids to private prisons.

370 2018-07-11 04:56:47 Are you really that dumb. Do you not understand our country’s economics, commodities market?  You question makes me sad that you’re an adult consumed by prejudice ignorance and incapable of independent thought. I hope I. Wrong and I can help you. You’re question worries me
371 2018-07-11 04:55:38 This is an article from 2012. And the commodities firm that was later brought down by short sellers wasn’t Olam but Noble.
372 2018-07-11 04:54:51 Can sm1 explain this phenomenon? One day every1 is preaching 'higher productivity', and on other days, we get a glut. Can't the same happen with other Agri commodities if we boost productivity? Are we over-stressing on higher productivity? @RiteshEconomist @AgriFoodRetail
373 2018-07-11 04:54:46 The only problem is that all the mentioned commodities  are being taxed due to our new law. Even I are against the imposed tax on each goods.
374 2018-07-11 04:47:29 Perang tarif antara Amerika dan China terlihat menekan sebagian besar produk soft commodities terutama #SoybeanFutures yang merupakan salah satu produk soft commodities Amerika yang nilai eksport nya cukup besar ke China.
375 2018-07-11 04:17:55 So I'm a long-time loser in commodities $PCRIX, But the Trump trade war, plus global fiscal irresponsibility and monetary accommodation, could obviously change things rapidly. If you don't have a 5% - 10% allocation to commodities, consider it.
376 2018-07-11 04:04:20 67)主婦たちは物価高をこぼしている。　

67)Housewives complain about high prices of commodities.
377 2018-07-11 03:55:23 But you can’t have enough good pass rushers either, and right now you can make an argument that they only have one. Carrie and Gaines are proven commodities. BBC is a quality nickel. Ward has Chris Harris upside. Finding a fit there with this existing group is difficult.
378 2018-07-11 03:55:13 The yuan, commodities, and chinese stocks slump as US-China trade wars escalate, meaning everything goes according to plan.
379 2018-07-11 03:33:25 UAV might have special contributions to Supply Chain solution to remote communities and of course a cost effective delivery solutions to Emergency Orders of vital health Commodities. Great start and waiting the lessons learned
380 2018-07-11 03:29:38 Why would someone report about former school arsonists now on the loose. There are a million ways to demand for basic commodities than destroy what takes ages to build (good roads). This is why we can't tell our school going children not to burn dormitories. Rubbish
381 2018-07-11 03:29:00 Don’t worry about what the markets are going to do, worry about what you are going to do in response to the markets.

385 2018-07-11 03:01:26 And face losing ur scholarship? I knew girls in college threatened w expulsion if they reported sexual assault on campus. Easy to say punch the SOB, but if that meant burning ur future? Not too easy then.
Athletes are commodities & if their coaches won't protect them, then WHO?
386 2018-07-11 02:51:30 China Steel at 3-week high, bucks general trend seen in commodities.

*Rpts say Tangshan plans more restrictions on steelmakers, plan to halve overall capacity
* China’s parliament seeks real-time emissions monitoring
387 2018-07-11 02:49:23 Commodities ex crude oil getting taken outback. HG_F can't find a bid. Global growth is not being accepted by everyone apparently.
388 2018-07-11 02:46:39 I don’t disagree with you. That being said, how many times do we hear people bemoaning a players injuries because it’s affecting their fantasy value? Fantasy football is messed up: we treat athletes like commodities...not like people with families, lives or emotions.

LME Aluminium: down 1.5%
LME Copper: down 0.9%
LME Zinc: down 2.8%
LME Nickel: down 0.4%

392 2018-07-11 02:01:49 something something scourge of our times and invisible labour, games (& digital commodities, and displaced commodities) seen to Exist Spontaneously, with no coherent understanding of the workers' role in them which leads to these kinds of absurdities? idk
393 2018-07-11 02:00:57 The Movement of Price, is the Same Across All Markets! Currencies, Commodities, Futures & Equities. The Only Difference, is the Leverage. A Professional Trader—Should be able to Trade—Any Market!

394 2018-07-11 01:57:31 *Steve Ballmer voice* commodities, commodities, commodities, commodities
395 2018-07-11 01:51:08 I dabble in commodities
396 2018-07-11 01:47:31 Cual labor? Acumular USD gracias al default, los microsueldos de la maxidevaluacion y el ciclo alcista de commodities con presión fiscal baja superávit gemelos que después destruyó CFK con atraso cambiario, impuestos, déficit y liquidación de reservas y capital energético?
397 2018-07-11 01:42:24 I am preferring commodities right now. We are nearing the end of the boom cycle. Equities can always go to 0, like Enron. But commodities will always be worth something. Texas drought means better beef prices in future years if demand remains.
398 2018-07-11 01:41:22 It’s like Society is a dirty word and this is what they divide into Left/Right wing factions. 
Where’s the middle ground? Govt dividing us all as if we are commodities not people.
399 2018-07-11 01:31:32 Commodities desabam nesse momento.  DOW 30 cai 1 %
400 2018-07-11 01:30:36 Commodities estão todas em forte queda agora. DOW 30 cai mais de 1%
401 2018-07-11 01:27:26 "That's why they say money can't buy you love. You buy commodities, love isn't a commodity. You buy matter made by people to sell, love isn't that. You buy experiences, love is so much more than that. "
402 2018-07-11 01:27:10 Trump is going to piss off the Chinese so bad that the cost of commodities in this country will skyrocket! Yet with his money it does not affect him, but The average American is just one brake job away from disaster!
403 2018-07-11 01:27:09 El cobre pasará como también lo hará el litio y nuestra economía, que lleva más de 250 años sustentada en la extracción de commodities, no puede seguir dependiendo de ellos con un bajo o nulo valor agregado
404 2018-07-11 01:24:45 Well why don't you pay a western wage to workers who work in a western country instead of treating foreign human beings as commodities? If you cannot afford to pay a fair wage then you shouldn't be in business. Scottish tory = Scottish traitor.
405 2018-07-11 01:20:01 Commodities getting shellacked across the board.  I would have thought gold might catch a bid, but nyet.
406 2018-07-11 01:18:26 Por que olhar "COBRE" ? Falamos de COBRE, falamos de commodities metálicas, historicamente ligadas a mineradoras e siderúrgicas..mas existe uma teoria no mercado financeiro que diz que COBRE é a mãe de todos os mercados..enfim.. sinais vindos do COBRE nunca devem ser descartados
407 2018-07-11 01:12:42 Phil...por enquanto, quando falamos de COBRE, falamos de mercados ligados a commodities metálicas.e que historicamente estão ligadas a mineradoras e siderúrgicas..não é uma correlação 100%..mas existe uma teoria no mercado financeiro que diz que COBRE é a mãe de todos os mercados
408 2018-07-11 01:02:00 CNH collapses >500 pips, and mainland commodities opened in a tailspin...
409 2018-07-11 00:55:26 Make a law that oil cannot be traded as a commodity in the US. Fix the price. Then maybe investors will invest in a factory? Making money from nothing is crap. (jealous). Commodities and stocks do more harm then good for the workers.

412 2018-07-11 00:33:20 So it's not as if capitalism is going great. Capitalism prioritizes overproduction of commodities and is fundamentally incapable of handling problems of the commons, which is quite literally putting humanity at risk of extinction, so "growth" is a moot point anyway 
413 2018-07-11 00:29:37 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.
414 2018-07-11 00:26:02 i’m not as valuable as a a manual worker, which is ludicrous. my point is that if you are about to die you suddenly realise you would pay any amount for another hour, and that gov values you at $4.75 or £8.50 in uk.
we aren’t commodities, one life is not worth more than another
415 2018-07-11 00:25:15 well, commodities tho.
416 2018-07-11 00:16:15 The merchant class again - just flipping commodities, but producing nothing! They justify their mark-ups with "marketing" costs among other intangeables.
