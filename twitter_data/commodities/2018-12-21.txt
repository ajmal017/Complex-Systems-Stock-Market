36 2018-12-23 21:08:07 Oil is not falling in a vacuum, look at industrial commodities in general and you see a similar similar pattern. Meanwhile the Fed is more concerned about accelerating #inflation The price instability is on the downside.

38 2018-12-23 20:49:06 Damn straight!. Highest stakes poker, patience is key, solidarity also. Both quite rare commodities at the moment.
39 2018-12-23 20:46:03 The dream of our children is selling finihed product to the world instead of trading commodities. #Youth of Africa, let's work toward the Africa we want through #InnovativeVolunteerism @RichardMunang Thank you for your vision
40 2018-12-23 20:38:56 If Australians are consuming less commodities that’s not a bad thing. We need to look beyond the retail spend for signs of economic health. Still spending big on services.
41 2018-12-23 20:32:18 I was reading Das Kapital the other day, and I was like, “this observation about how mechanization amplifies the relative surplus value of labor while cheapening the worth of commodities is on-fleek, fam!”
42 2018-12-23 20:29:06 Claro, pero desde 2011 que avisaron que iban a subir la tasa cuando mejoraran los números de empleo. Tradicionalmente a tasa más alta menor precio en los commodities.
43 2018-12-23 20:22:33 Furthermore, as an MP your duty is to put the needs of the people first... Why fight for cars when people can't afford basic commodities, which constituency will you visit and who will you talk to when people are suffering... We know kufunga kunoti netsei...when in power...

46 2018-12-23 20:12:01 Chimodho needs flower, cooking oil, eggs, sugar and salt. These are the very commodities that are either expensive or not in shelves.
47 2018-12-23 20:04:43 Person A has 10 birds and 10 dollars.
Person B has 10 bags of grain and 10 dollars.

Person A and B each buy the other's goods at a dollar/item

A week later the goats and grain have been consumed.

Each person has 10 dollars now but no commodities.

Just an observation.

51 2018-12-23 19:32:48 pockets are one of the most underrated commodities
52 2018-12-23 19:10:40 If China finally has the big one then sure, but if not these quantities are trivial. Currently the shock to em in terms of weak commodities is far less than 15/16
53 2018-12-23 19:10:07 Bitcoin is hard money.  It is mathematically proven to be scarce and accessible globally.  Future robots will be able to mine gold or scarce commodities much more efficient, and inflate its value.
54 2018-12-23 18:46:23 The common man measures economy by the price of market commodities. PMB what's your take? @MBuhari @atiku @bukolasaraki @renoomokri @ogundamisi @toluogunlesi
55 2018-12-23 18:43:56 Truth: Southern Border is access/entry for Black Markets that are owned by Lobbyists, as well as cheap human slave wage commodities.  North Korea is to China..what Mexico is to the Demo_Rats and their Globalist Masters.
56 2018-12-23 18:31:33 That's a really heartwarming story. What you did was done with patience, grace and class...increasingly all too rare commodities these days!
57 2018-12-23 18:17:45 Yes, they can. Because we are in a disinflatonary industrial -digital- revolution, the world economy is weaker and on the verge of commercial war, the dollar is strong, price of commodities & oil is falling, globalization means price competition, trade unions have lost power, ..
58 2018-12-23 18:11:40 We’ve allowed our children to become commodities and our schools to become privatized with public dollars. This is criminal and the children of New Orleans deserve better.
59 2018-12-23 17:56:41 Mum said we should invest in carrot stocks and commodities now, we’ll make a killing!!
60 2018-12-23 17:55:01 Yeah, it kind of does.  But right now commodities collapsed too.  Is that hurting lower income Americans or helping lower income Americans?

Earnings on a lot of these companies are still high.  Which is the weird thing. This stock market collapse will be quite unique I believe.
61 2018-12-23 17:54:00 You’re so naive. You have no idea what drives the cost of commodities in the US and you really don’t care or you’d start learning. 

No, the easy thing for you is to just be a tool for the MSM and spew their garbage.
62 2018-12-23 17:53:15 Ele fez isso porque, aproveitando os lucros das commodities, tinha como proposta política redistribuir renda e assegurar acesso à saúde, educação, emprego e moradia aos brasileiros.  Outro governo teria usado os recursos para concentrar ainda mais a renda.
63 2018-12-23 17:52:57 endorse views of Maulana. PTI govt should appoint a Minister for Control of Price Hike of all essential commodities going far away from reach of Poor, downtrodden/vulnerable Peoples.

64 2018-12-23 17:51:10 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
65 2018-12-23 17:47:17 This graph does nothing to highlight the fact that these countries with high air pollution are majority export-based industrial economies. Their air pollution stems from producing tons of cheap commodities for post-industrial western consumption.
66 2018-12-23 17:42:12 He's not getting the opportunity. Hes the 5th option most of his minutes behind proven commodities ( LMA, Gay, DeRozan, breakout Forbes). Pop also has handled him poorly by putting him on a short leash most of the season.
67 2018-12-23 17:34:20 Unfortunately, animals for consumption, viewed as commodities are mainly dismissed with little to no consideration as feeling, sentient beings; in addition, this callous disregard changes the brains of the handlers.
68 2018-12-23 17:28:34 @n_srnck Quoting you: "[...] if data is a central resource, and capitalist competition places a high premium on getting that data, then our age will inevitably be filled with privacy scandals." Outcome of commodification / fictitious commodities & disembedded economy (Polanyi)?
69 2018-12-23 17:25:53 Hux... unaccustomed to niceties and non-FO commodities. Well, that aren't teas.
70 2018-12-23 17:18:52 Ele fez isso somente porque deu a sorte de os valores das commodities estarem muito acima do esperado. Com isso ele teve dinheiro em caixa. É só olhar a variação do valor das commodities brasileiras exportadas para a China no período. Não houve milagre...
71 2018-12-23 17:18:09 Los inversores se están acomodando a un mundo con condiciones monetarias más estrictas y a la amenaza de una recesión económica, ha dicho el Banco de Pagos Internacionales (BPI). La caída del barril de petróleo, el cobre y otros commodities avalan una economía lenta.
72 2018-12-23 17:15:35 The rebel in me still contends all that is happening to farmers is to close them out so Big Ag can take over. With climate change possibly speeding up, food and water will be the commodities to control...
73 2018-12-23 17:12:09 You say that like being in commodities is a financially dependable way for an energy company to make money quarter after quarter.

Breaking News: it isn't.
74 2018-12-23 16:54:15 I also voted worse than expected and will attend 15+ games this year with enthusiasm. We gave away proven talent for commodities that have yet to prove they will be worth the talent we gave up. Of course there's hope, but today it's silly to say the ROI hasn't been disappointing
75 2018-12-23 16:51:45 Aquela época testemunhou crescimento de todos os emergentes. O mercado internacional estava aquecido (principalmente de commodities). Lula não fez quase nada. Poderia ter feito se tivesse tocado reformas, mas essa agenda passa longe do PT.
76 2018-12-23 16:50:07 A reportagem mesmo menciona fatores além do controle dos governantes da década. Por exemplo, Argentina saía de retração, e economias mais dependentes de commodities cresceram mais.
77 2018-12-23 16:48:56 A dúvida continua: qual a política que será adotada? Reforma da Previdência? Reforma Tributária? Ainda não tem clareza de proposta,  brigam via Twitter com a China que é o maior importador de commodities brasileiras? Acabar com o sistema S, que ganha medalhas? Otimismo pra quem?
78 2018-12-23 16:48:54 I thought the dad was in commodities or stock exchange. 80s, Chicago. Makes sense to me.
79 2018-12-23 16:36:20 I AGREE,   COMMODITIES KI KAMI
80 2018-12-23 16:27:22 Commodities *and* insider trading, too!
81 2018-12-23 16:16:28 Agree demand is not big issue but consumption growth is down (see charts posted late last wk). Also agree evidence sparse for recession. I'm concerned that oil price collapse reflects devaluation. If so, it will soon spread to other commodities & recession possible later on.
82 2018-12-23 16:16:11 Trading Kuli and Guddy was the right move. Look at them now. All but worthless commodities. Pretty much everything else wasn’t. Agreed.
83 2018-12-23 16:04:59 That's why companies hegde on Commodities.
84 2018-12-23 16:01:01 the ongoing global recession, demand for expansion commodities are finally dropping. Problem is these commodities are needed for the Ponzi scheme to continue. The money printing will accelerate :(
85 2018-12-23 15:58:47 The oil & NG from the Permian and other locales has produced historic surplus energy & low & stable prices! Commodities are in free fall! These economic deflationary factors historically keep inflation tame! WTF is Powell thinking? Has not cited these factors! Truly frightening!
86 2018-12-23 15:56:58 It's not even that, but supply wasn't even the reason we went down in the 1st place IMO.  Its demand, other commodities (namely industrial metals) have been saying it sine the beginning of the year
87 2018-12-23 15:40:48 Mi grafico no dice eso. Una variable exogena para la argentina es la tasa de interés internacional y los precios de los commodities. Eso es sólo parte de lo que determina al TCR y la oferta de divisas local.
88 2018-12-23 15:40:17 Again...when you are a developing country with limited productive output or exports...you can’t actually rule the world UNLESS you export capital and import all commodities. That’s how imperialism works.
89 2018-12-23 15:38:56 Estado podia subsidiar minhas importações de eletrônica para desenvolver tecnologia e parar de ser economia de commodities.

Ur desciption sounds more lyk d CPP-NPA, hu imposes rev taxes on legit Cos., extorts basic commodities frm townfolk & farmers and as if that wasn't enuf, orders its maniacal bandits 2 kill tribal leaders & politicos hu dont support their cause... duh!
91 2018-12-23 15:30:02 Lolz...... Check well before you price commodities... #endtimeshit
92 2018-12-23 15:28:16 Imagine the wisdom of having a private committee set the cash price of all commodities.

Now imagine it sets the short term price of borrowing money.

And the most important members are chosen by politicians who know very little about economics and are focused on the short term.
93 2018-12-23 15:23:22 This whole coming to twitter talking about "those who really need it".....someone's got a phone and cash to buy data, kids are out there on the streets hawking all kinds of petty commodities..... You still out here looking for who really needs it? Y'all just really want to trend
94 2018-12-23 15:10:28 Okay Chad,

I said based on my literal years of work in agricultural economics policy UBI needs food + housing provided to prevent predatory inflation and to boost actual commodities

Free food programs don't need to eliminate choice you donut, they just need to give FREE FOOD.
95 2018-12-23 14:58:06 Despicable behaviour when are we going to stop treating animals as commodities they are fellow sentient beings and they should be treated as such. It hurts me to my core.
96 2018-12-23 14:44:29 Even after commodities are cheaper why hotelling is TOO costly?.
97 2018-12-23 14:36:56 I appreciate the way @AmyTrask talks about guys with love and not as commodities. So many in sports miss that. People are people. Spotlight or not. Perceived riches or not.
98 2018-12-23 14:29:54 Por favor, não fale isso. O agronegócio brasileiro é extremamente competitivo. A questão reside no fato de exportamos commodities com baixo valor agregado.
99 2018-12-23 14:23:10 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
100 2018-12-23 14:16:47 Please. I don't know, which is why I asked. I'm still not clear. I suspect this is not as simple as you think.

For example, the same would apply to all sorts of other commodities, not just coffee beans, so we should impose tariffs on all those other things? Is that correct?
101 2018-12-23 14:11:16 Leveraged trading is a form of liquidity, which in turn have a stabilizing effect on price. Compare volatility of stocks with options contracts v those without or prices on commodities that have a futures market v those without.
102 2018-12-23 13:46:20 Do you haul commodities for other farmers or like commercial goods?
103 2018-12-23 13:42:36 One must also start debating the progress of' Badavara Bandhu scheme' of Shri H D kumaraswamy . I am having some doubt , because GST is reduced for all essential commodities and there is no / very less tax for vegetables in market.
104 2018-12-23 13:34:05 7. Approaching bankruptcy and the end of "enzi za Mwalimu" - Scarcity of  food commodities were rampant. Food were  only bought using  special ration card. The Almighy brought Mwinyi  to our rescue!
8. Popular newspaper babtized Mwinyi as "Mr Clean" Next day it was banned!
105 2018-12-23 13:32:23 I have never seen sanything like this... these people are horrific... those poor children are just commodities to these monsters... I am shocked!

107 2018-12-23 13:18:17 Isso que Lula teve a vantagem de pegar as commodities em alta, mesmo assim o PT quebrou o país
108 2018-12-23 13:02:47 Safe to guess that locations in DHA are marketable commodities. My information comes from an NGO that traces kidnapped kids to such grps.
109 2018-12-23 12:58:30 Everything u say is a LIE. U said Howard had $800B commodities boom. Show me a link? It was Labor who had the commodity boom. U then say Howard had good terms of trade. WRong!!!. His trade was average. You sir are a LIAR like all ALP supporters
110 2018-12-23 12:52:48 Reducing tax on cenema is good, nobody objects. But what is required  is to reduce tax on essential commodities, after all Amadmi  particularly the middle class is suffering ,pahele Khana us ka bad maja karna.
111 2018-12-23 12:49:57 A política anunciada do governo Bozo p/a agricultura, pecuária e meio ambiente é um tiro no pé do agronegócio, pensando nas commodities e os padrões internacionais de certificação. Eu q defendo agricultura familiar e segurança alimentar já estou com pena de ruralista arrependido.

So you agree, Commodities are traded on the Stock Market.
.
Next, where are bonds traded?
.
113 2018-12-23 12:29:57 Ye purana paintra hai rajniti ka. Same goes to price hike in commodities as well.
114 2018-12-23 12:27:07 Highly agree with this forecast. 2019/20 will be apocalyptic for the economic system. I’d suggest investing in commodities like gold/silver.. keep large amounts of money out of accounts! And if employed, gain more digital/tech skills as major delayering will occur in companies.
115 2018-12-23 12:21:40 It’s not yet time to reap such harvests when the Congregation still face Cholera threats everyday, lack of cash, medicines, drugs, basic commodities, electricity 24/7 and clean running tap-water among an endless need of supplies.

118 2018-12-23 11:33:03 Lot of commodities used in daily life exempted from gst and for many goods gst rates are reduced. @RahulGandhi and his ancestors were good at spreading hoax. They always kept inflation high, tax rate higher to make money from middle class earning #GST #Budget2019 #BJP @BJP4India
119 2018-12-23 11:24:12 Price hike in commodities too....
120 2018-12-23 11:17:16 Even then the dollar's price increased to a record extent & the prices of essential commodities raised crushing the purchase power of the public.
The values of saved amounts in banks loosen, around 25% & public has nothing to do with your given useless figures.
121 2018-12-23 11:09:20 They aren't allowed to build their own procurement chain direct to farmer. They have to buy from APMC middlemen. So the value they add to perishable commodities is questionable.
122 2018-12-23 11:08:36 With all due respect do not expose your ignorance here. I said its rich in terms of resources like raw materials. They have almost all precious commodities like gold, diamonds, uranium, cobalt etc.

125 2018-12-23 10:43:16 "karl marx was right and post-capitalist structures engender commodities that further exclude marginalized communities from cultural and social participation" (bro i had a dream we fucked au ch 2, 2018)
126 2018-12-23 10:37:38 Duterte has been utterly merciless to the Filipino people. He imposes on them a heavy tax burden and causes the soaring prices of basic commodities. Not satisfied with the daily violence of exploitation, he has given his armed minions license to kill people with impunity.
127 2018-12-23 10:35:52 Sir, you are doing very good. But try to start development work , it creates a lot of  work opportunity for labour and some others business. Cost of commodities will also be covered with good earnings.
128 2018-12-23 10:26:47 hot commodities cost money on this side, dear
129 2018-12-23 10:23:26 AgMarknet has helped to reach farmers who do not have sufficient resources to get adequate market information. It facilitates web- based information flow, of the daily arrivals and prices of commodities in agricultural produce markets spread across country. Kudos Ravi Sir & team
130 2018-12-23 10:19:57 GST in higher slabs is a loot, it should be 2%on commodities.
131 2018-12-23 10:13:56 I'm uncomfortable with this kind of comparison. It's not the same time. 
Not the same money supply, not the same production of Milk, gas, egg, goods, commodities... and compare gold and paper... 
132 2018-12-23 10:13:29 Omar Bashir must go. Stop killing the protesters because you raised the price of bread exorbitantly and other commodities because of manmade inflation you caused.
There should be democratic leadership at the top to start w/. Bashir must be swept away.
133 2018-12-23 10:13:02 Consider this. The commodities bull run we experienced between early-2016 to early/mid-2018, could have been a huge BEAR-FLAG on the monthly TF. If that is the case, then markets are prob anticipating the D-word at some point in the not-too-distant future imo..
134 2018-12-23 09:57:50 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
135 2018-12-23 09:54:24 Don’t give a pet as a gift, as it can send the wrong message that animals are commodities and therefore ‘disposable’.

137 2018-12-23 09:31:10 Good decision to reduce gst rates. Basic necessary commodities should he free of GST in interest of poor.
138 2018-12-23 09:30:03 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
139 2018-12-23 09:16:48 "Please do give him trouble. A traitor like him should not have any commodities."
140 2018-12-23 09:11:46 Export of Urban Naxals will treble our commodities export in 3 yrs
141 2018-12-23 08:37:34 Commodities and currency will still exist for a very long time and will only be abolished when we are producing enough to provide for everyone
142 2018-12-23 08:35:50 Which is a problem. Many jobs depend on the existence of these commodities. Our economy would be a lot smaller if we only focused on the bare necessities.
143 2018-12-23 08:34:27 Who would dull out these luxuries/commodities? I assume that would be the government. 

How is that any better than using currency to buy however many of these luxuries you want?
144 2018-12-23 08:23:34 How do you distribute these commodities without currency?
145 2018-12-23 08:19:41 You take the ports, you manage what links the port and mainland... They'll smuggle the whole fakeass China and we won't even have a clue.
An influx of counterfeit commodities will hit our markets. Y'all know who will suffer most 
146 2018-12-23 08:07:01 You don't see anything wrong because you too lazy to interrogate. Should he or should he not use public resources for private matters ? This is how Kenyatta Snr ferried statehouse furniture all the way to his rural home. Public assets being turned into private commodities
147 2018-12-23 07:57:46 I like RaGa.  But hope to see him digging out some concrete ideas than loan waiving and distribution of commodities to lure voters which finally falls flat on the economy of the country.
148 2018-12-23 07:50:31 Still, we need to start paying fair prices for social commodities.
149 2018-12-23 07:43:30 GST, focus on accountability with little human intervention. It's an automated process. Further your article doesn't divine whats overdone. If GST focus on flat 18% tax, as suggested by Aravind, don't you think poor will suffer?  Regular commodities price will go high? +
150 2018-12-23 07:37:21 So, yeah, I don't think you guys are evil, or anything, but your idea of freedom is nothing like the freedom I envision for people. I want ppl to be free from being seen as commodities, especially, bcz human labor is virtually obsolete.
151 2018-12-23 07:22:23 There is nothing "normal" about what is going on right now with the global economy, w/tariffs, collapsing financials and indust commodities, erc. After breaking 2540 S&P and with major downtrends around the world a PM must be defensive right now. I have cash levels similar to 08
152 2018-12-23 07:04:43 #Oil is stealing the whole scene in #commodities right now
153 2018-12-23 07:00:07 "Black women are seen as commodities and are only utilized for their bodies." PREACH IT
154 2018-12-23 06:46:13 Govt. says in Parliament that Central Police Canteen is a non-profit set-up to provide cheaper commodities to CAPF personnel. But they are not ready to exempt GST as done in the case of CSD Canteen. So what magic we should expect from them?

156 2018-12-23 05:57:47 I hope people stop thinking abt players like commodities & how to milk money off players from early on without proper professional services and resources given to players, and think abt more mutual beneficial environment like in Asia T2 scene. Contracts shouldn't be so unfair.
157 2018-12-23 05:45:35 Fintribune "Around 88.37 million tons of commodities were loaded and unloaded in #Iran’s 17 major #ports during the first eight months of the current Iranian year (March 21-Nov. 21) to register a 13.3% decline compared with the similar period of last year …
158 2018-12-23 05:36:18 Commodities are the opium of the people.
159 2018-12-23 05:32:58 The only items in constant abundance are smallhouses and Ben10s. Whereas all other commodities are dwindling, the two are way on the rise.
160 2018-12-23 05:16:38 Listen e argument is not tht we don't wanna give MPs cars bt its the type of car & How much is it gonna cost us as taxpayers. We hv an Economy tht is running side ways, civil servants are struggling to afford basic Household commodities & (fees,Rent,Rates) we only need to be fair
161 2018-12-23 04:58:07 Another@lie from Cong team B4 election promise exposed - promised to reduce GST rates  B4 - now after winning elections they now are opposing reduction of GST rates of some of the commodities from 28 to 18 %. Shame on Cong party and Piti all those people who voted. Jai Hind
162 2018-12-23 04:57:50 @ImranKhanPTI sir, with respect instead appealing all time, pls use think-tank on how to control basic commodities prices, saaf paani, gas & health, schooling & police.
163 2018-12-23 04:45:21 We are still very much viewed as slaves and commodities that can be exploited
164 2018-12-23 04:40:05 Hoarding of vital commodities has started in Congress ruled states. Urgency of fund collection necessitates free hand to mafia barons.
165 2018-12-23 04:08:02 So in the GST meeting, all opposition members opposed reducing price of commodities.
Outside meeting room, they want Vikas, and inside they don't want. This is the Real face of Congress
166 2018-12-23 04:05:55 I think he’s similar to Chacin, but Burnes and Woodruff are still unproven commodities. Jimmy missed an entire year with an injury known to detrimentally impact pitcher performance, and Chase and Davies seemed unusable last season.
167 2018-12-23 04:05:50 Commodities deflated first due to demand (gfc), then shale kicked in. Not other way around

170 2018-12-23 03:19:39 Wondering if you meant commodities in that last sentence.
171 2018-12-23 03:04:22 Ya viene por ahí algún espadachin de causa perdida a decir q se mantiene por los otros commodities..5-4-3-2-…
172 2018-12-23 03:00:00 The value of one commodity is to the value of any other, as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other. “As values, all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labour time.”

#Marxism #Marxism #Capital
173 2018-12-23 02:56:12 There are “secondary markets” for all sorts of utilities and commodities. Humans do that. Why do Bitcoin and ETH need exchanges or forward markets? Why can’t I live off gold dust?
174 2018-12-23 02:53:46 And the long end of the yield curve has been weak all year, commodities collapsing, the banks may also be weak due to credit risk.  European banks look particularly ugly.

176 2018-12-23 02:41:22 Esse, sendo um dos mais importantes negócios para o país, deve ser prestigiado, mas precisamos urgentemente não depender de commodities.
177 2018-12-23 02:33:52 Ok, ha oportunidades infraestrutura.
Mas nao tem inovacao nem competitividade. E isso nao vai mudar de uma hora pra outra. 
Pelo menos + 20 anos, se tudo der certo, com commodities sendo principal driver.
178 2018-12-23 02:29:15 Exato!
Se mudar o time frame, colocar 2008-2010 e depois 2016-2018 muda totalmente a figura. 
Brasil depende de commodities e tem cordao umbilical com a China.
179 2018-12-23 02:27:59 Breaking 2540 with free falls in oil, lumber, industrial commodities regional banks etc a crash would not be surprising.  No recession in 87 either, though real interest rates had been rising all year then. Monday is a holiday shortened day, but setup similar. Thanks  Kassy.
180 2018-12-23 02:16:43 The downward momentum for stocks will continue during the next months. I predict that we will see a massive flow of capital from the stock market into commodities (mostly #gold) and #Bitcoin. BTC likely already bottomed and the demand will rise. Most alts will die though. #crypto
181 2018-12-23 02:13:07 I feel like you're not grasping my issue with your reply either. I'm not saying you arent caring for animals but i am saying when we choose to purchase dairy products it supports female bodies used as commodities to produce milk, eggs & cheese which male animals dont produce
182 2018-12-23 01:57:05 The hardest part about the Information Age is how much of it is just terrible.

I am wondering what sort of true apocalypse it will take before humans start treating each other, beyond their immediate clan, as something other than objects or commodities. 

Are we even capable?
183 2018-12-23 01:52:52 If there could be like free trade agreements but with Ag where countries agree not to subsidize certain crops or at least to a certain level, that would be good for competition & reducing demand for things that really shouldn’t be consumed that much (aforementioned commodities).
184 2018-12-23 01:48:54 Es verdad. Pero el FA tuvo años excepcionales de tasa de interes por el piso y precio de commodities altisisimos. Y vamos a terminar el ciclo con deficit arriba del 4%, estado ineficiente, corrupcion, costo de vida altisimo, empresas cerrando y desempleo creciente. Muchos debes
185 2018-12-23 01:47:44 Objetivo: virar colônia, vendendo commodities, dependente do mercado externo. Independência nem pensar, liderança no cone Sul não precisa. Rasgue-se BRICS.
186 2018-12-23 01:45:09 Well, #timevalue-ofmoney. Loan affects Government cash flows which is a load on the Governement's cash resources. Get loans from bank buy luxury vehicles at banks terms. Scarce gvt cash can to used for critical commodities like drugs, fuel, debt repay etc
187 2018-12-23 01:38:34 Right, Worldwide, we are not seeing much change in the general availability of food as commodities.
188 2018-12-23 01:37:02 Extortion is when a corporate cabal excercises monopoly power over farmland, minerals, commodities, & banking.

Average people, joining together to form a system that protects them from foreign & domestic enemies, is a democracy.

Corporate structure is necessarily authoritarian.
189 2018-12-23 01:36:00 When we're all jobless and homeless, who'll support his crime family then ? Oh, that's right. He's got billions to spare. The rest of us are expendible commodities. We can all starve. Sounding 3rd world yet ??
190 2018-12-23 01:34:35 Pay attention to how quickly black trends turn into commodities
191 2018-12-23 01:32:41 If mining doesn’t determine the marginal cost then it absolutely does NOT trade like any kind of metal. Monetary or otherwise. 

You and Murad need to learn about metals / commodities pricing.
192 2018-12-23 01:27:34 Do you understand that commodities are by their nature cyclical industries? Ottawa is working on the new pipeline but that won’t bring back $120 a barrel oil. You might need a Plan B. Also for context Ontario lost 500K manufacturing jobs in 
last 10 yrs - AB isn’t unique...
193 2018-12-23 01:23:15 One of the only commodities that can not be taxed or overvalued...
194 2018-12-23 01:20:42 Professional athletes are merely commodities that are owned, bought, sold and traded by team owners. They are not valued as human beings. The team owners and the fans only value their ability or talents or contributions to score, to win games and entertain us.
195 2018-12-23 01:12:29 Que imbécil. Ahora falta que la soya, como es un commodities, es un hidrocarburo.
196 2018-12-23 01:08:17 Markets are too smart to fall for that I'm afraid, and, that assumes the Fed is ultimately in charge if something. Look at the long end of the yield curve to see who's in charge. Bond market won this battle in 00 & 06, and with commodities in free fall it's looking like 3 4 3 2me
197 2018-12-23 01:07:40 Jajajaj. Y sigue el idiota. Es un mineral. No me haga colocarle un link para que siga pasando pena. Jajaja ahora falta que me diga que el trigo por ser un commodities es un hidrocarburo. Pelmazo de mierd....

200 2018-12-23 00:49:45 I am not referring to stock prices but industrial #Commodities, #oilandgas, lumber etc.  If the #Inflation objective the Fed is targeting is 2%, then these prices should an upward drift & firm bid. At present these prices are accelerating south, inconsistent with Fed tightening.
201 2018-12-23 00:47:39 Sell short everything but commodities.
202 2018-12-23 00:44:17 I used to think a man who only valued me for my body/commodities & not me as a human didn’t value me cuz I wasn’t worthy of valuing. Recently I came across a similar situation, but this time thought, “He doesn’t value me because he isn’t ready, willing, or able to value someone.”
203 2018-12-23 00:38:10 How do you think markets like the TSX will fair with their higher weight to PM's and commodities? Also being non USD.
204 2018-12-23 00:32:27 In the wasteland of the future... gold, booze, bullets, and canned dog food will be THE commodities.
205 2018-12-23 00:28:04 A part of the problem is that humans treat animals as commodities, so any correlation between human animals and non human animals is always seen as an insult when we are all beings worthy of a life free from suffering.
206 2018-12-23 00:27:10 Yeah it would have nice if they could have had 1 Arizona Team and another one in the other league.  One of my worries is that young relievers now or soon starters won't get an opportunity w/ Cubs because alot of people want Proven Commodities in pitching

244 2018-12-22 21:18:46 ... comeca a ficar complicado para o Brasil, pois ao inves de movimento tecnico vai ser movimento macro.
Outro fator que temos q observar eh a China. Nossa economia depende de commodities que dependem da China. Um slowdown forte na China sera pior pra nos que nos EUA ...
245 2018-12-22 21:15:35 That could be down to picking the secondary commodities market if it has one. If you have time, pop in a ticket and I can chase properly.
246 2018-12-22 21:00:26 Definitely a relationship..but different commodities are going down for different reasons..Oil is down because we have an oversupply thanks to US shale, alternative energy sources and electric vehicles. Lower energy has a pervasive effect through other categories and inflation
247 2018-12-22 20:55:42 African farmers were given inputs & offtake agreements, had in-house agronomy...in-house commodities trading... in-house milling... in-house logistics for each link in the value chain then agreements with formal & informal retailers...it was really ... Then greed struck.
248 2018-12-22 20:53:33 More like ranch owners and us players were/are the cattle.   Commodities. Bought, sold & traded while productive, put out to pasture eventually or get the nail gun.
249 2018-12-22 20:33:58 Oh you really don't need to tell me how TIPS move with oil. I think I died on this hill quite a few times. Presumably if we are right about the dollar crash then commodities benefit and so reals go down.
250 2018-12-22 20:29:01 $SPX Fun fact: The S&P 500 Index is now -17.83% lower through Friday from its all-time high 3 months ago on Sept. 21st    $SPY $SLV $GLD $QQQ $DJIA $DIA $BTC $ETH $TLT #stockmarket #commodities #investing #finance #stocks #gold #silver $FB $TWTR $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA $INTC $AMD $NFLX
251 2018-12-22 20:28:45 I like your predictions, thank you. What do you think about oil, silver and other commodities?
252 2018-12-22 20:14:30 Also, the comments about just doing what the boss says are superficial and completely miss the point he was trying to make. Sure NFL players make millions, but they're treated as commodities instead of human beings. Suppression of opinion is a deeper problem.
253 2018-12-22 20:13:39 Added new complete DeMark study to #soybeans $zs_f with updated Elliott Wave and Gann analysis. #commodities #futures
254 2018-12-22 20:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
255 2018-12-22 20:02:38 Mpumalanga should be a country on it's own such as Lesotho because our immense contribution to growing the economies is unapprecaited, we could form a coalition government with Mozambique for trade relations

Y'al don't understand we rich in agriculture, tourism and commodities
256 2018-12-22 19:57:50 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
257 2018-12-22 19:53:53 paradox exists - rates of GST gets revision since its implementation in 2017 - prices of edibles in hotels rising - opinions differ but fact remains that prices are rising because of rising cost of petrol & diesel skyrocketing transport chgs gets added to commodities of daily use
258 2018-12-22 19:44:30 I actually think it makes long bonds more of a buy.  At the margin, it means a relatively less easy fed.  So flattening of the curve, commodities down, USD a tougher call.  It also depends if the crisis intensifies.  Assuming it doesn’t, then stronger USD.
259 2018-12-22 19:40:28 É isso aí. Vamos vender nossas commodities ao mundo inteiro, longe de comércio ideológico com quem quer que seja.
260 2018-12-22 19:40:01 For all Imbeciles, you pay trade deficits by selling more goods and commodities, not from gov. Budget. #CantTeachStupids
261 2018-12-22 19:39:14 Ok. What does this give us then? Higher USD and lower commodities? Are bonds a short?
262 2018-12-22 19:24:57 If importers partly absorb the price increase they raise inflation for businesses the overall affect on the economy is the same
Countries are limited in how much they can devalue their currency because they import commodities in dollar and would stoke inflation in their countries
263 2018-12-22 19:21:59 Obama added way more jobs during his tenure but go ahead. Oh, yeah bringing down less than half a percent on jobless rate is something to brag about. 3.1% wage is all erased by inflation and increase of commodities and fuel prices stemmed from  market uncertainty....
264 2018-12-22 19:20:17 One moment I am convinced there is no forex in the country, wecant even buy drugs and healthcare commodities. 

Next moment I see ferrero roche, kellog's cereals filling supermarkets. Then MPs get new IMPORTED cars. 

There is enough forex for our needs!
265 2018-12-22 19:18:14 What's comfortable about Lekki? 
The flood? 
Traffic jam? 
Overpriced commodities? 
Are the roads great? 
Power situation not fantastic. 
Lmao
I'd stay in Transamadi in 6000 lifetimes over Lekki
266 2018-12-22 19:12:16 How hot commodities work in coaching:
1. Agent calls @MikeGarafolo @RapSheet @AdamSchefter 
2. Agent says my client is either next up and comer or getting lots of interest.
3. The insiders go on twitter/TV/radio and regurgitate.
267 2018-12-22 19:08:37 I wish i could trade commodities and equity markets 2 more years. 2 more years.
268 2018-12-22 18:43:25 When Kaepernick has been blackballed for voicing political views and Eric Reid has been targeted for testing and fines for his vocal support, that is not treating them with dignity. When players are viewed as commodities instead of people, that is not dignity.
269 2018-12-22 18:42:36 CONGRAT TO GST COUNCIL FOR REDUCING THE PRICE OF 33 COMMODITIES THROUGH OUT THE COUNTRY. CITIZENS ARE NOT ONLY HAPPY BUT RELIEVED.@republic @TimesNow @IndiaToday @arunjaitley @narendramodi @BJP4India @BJPBengal
@ProfSudhir
270 2018-12-22 18:42:18 In the last thirty years Sudan has seen endless corruption; prices of commodities has more than doubled and a president wanted by the international criminal court for genocide and crimes against humanity. Enough is enough! #Sudan_Revolts
271 2018-12-22 18:26:45 With an ever growing market, newcomers must be different.

At EMX, both #crypto and traditional #futures (equities, commodities, forex) are listed on one exchange, with all collateral and P&L payable in crypto, removing the need to ever convert to fiat and pay high fees.
272 2018-12-22 18:26:31 @arunjaitley HON SIR AGAIN YOU HAVE TO REDUCE ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES RATES TO MAXIMUM LOW DHANYAWAD
273 2018-12-22 18:17:26 ...ve que no leyo el manifiesto de uso de la "republiqueta", "commodities and workforce almost free; ven que sirve ir a Harvard?...
274 2018-12-22 18:11:00 False. The craft is very specialized, only .001 percent of people in the world can make that business sustainable. It’s not like any other business. Players aren’t replaceable commodities
275 2018-12-22 18:08:58 GST aur bhi kam hogi kuch din me daily commodities par
276 2018-12-22 17:58:04 Congress, CPM,TMC,AAP & all parties have been  opposing Bjp as Bjp has reduced GST Slabs to reduce the price of different essential commodities. @ZeeNews @IndiaToday @R. @TimesNow @abpnewstv
277 2018-12-22 17:55:55 We are the only industrialized nation that still allows basic human services like healthcare & education to be run as for-profit, free market commodities. Our economy is based on some old ideas that the rest of the world has left behind. The GOP lives in an old, greedy world.
278 2018-12-22 17:45:48 Thankful to  Govt for revisiting it's decision on GST. This will lessen the tax burden on commodities for common man.Hope this should continue and it should not be for specific time period.
279 2018-12-22 17:38:36 You have to keep in mind that Caithness was landlocked for a long time. English commodities didn’t matter quite as much as what everyone on the other side of the North Sea had.
280 2018-12-22 17:37:14 Here I come with my two cents. If we're arguing in favor of govnt mandated, lets say "necessities" policy, and we fully automate, what incentive is there to even own a food business outside of "eating out"? Those places become what they already effectively are, commodities
281 2018-12-22 17:35:24 Ahora, en eso intervienen otros factores como son la oferta y la demanda, los precios de los commodities, y evidentemente el precio del dolar y el petróleo.
282 2018-12-22 17:33:11 Globally US has plentiful & least expensive energy?Commodities in price downtrend?These are deflationary forces! Deflation results in lower retail prices! Food,utilities,staples will go down too? Fed jingoistic?Not citing these forces & raising interest rates? Help me out? Why?
283 2018-12-22 17:29:06 The problem with the Federal Reserve is this; they are using 20th century data to solve a new, 21st digital economy where price competition has intensified and prices of commodities are depreciating @realDonaldTrump @cvpayne @MariaBartiromo @jimcramer @TeamCavuto
284 2018-12-22 17:27:33 The issue of the protests is racial inequality. Why wouldn’t an owner be against an issue that affects the communities of 75% of their current & future workforce? Unless, they don’t really care because their athletes aren’t viewed as human, just commodities
285 2018-12-22 17:27:19 Commodities?
286 2018-12-22 17:26:16 That’s why you should not sleep most of the time. GST for many commodities have been reduced in every GST council sitting. Ask madam how many such council meeting happened and if she is even aware of it
287 2018-12-22 17:12:25 This is what the patriarchy does to all of us. As commodities in their system, we all "work for the man." I'm fed up with men talking over me and yelling whatever vitriol they spew.
288 2018-12-22 17:04:04 Esse é o cara, não tenho dúvidas que o Brasil sairá do lamaçal bolivariano, temos tudo para estarmos nos lugares de destaque dentro da economia mundial, vamos reindustrializar o país, transformar as commodities em valor agregado e gerar milhões de empregos.
289 2018-12-22 17:00:02 How is it not superfluous to try, by the convention has accordingly taken singly, will be involved in the station which requires the knowledge of their various commodities.
290 2018-12-22 16:50:27  $BTCUSD . If it overcomes ~4200$ with force...We might have an another bull run, to who knows what highs.But I dont believe it will and its an amazing place right now to sell.Dont get your hopes up on this basically worthless thing. #Commodities
291 2018-12-22 16:44:53 Of course it will be. But that isnt really the question. What will be the near term ramifications? Curve bear steepens, USD falls, commodities rise gold particularly, LC EM debt performs great. Equities wont do great IMHO
292 2018-12-22 16:44:03 Collapsing prices of farm commodities, but consumers are paying high price for the same farm produce along with inflation on food article prices.
Farm loan waiver is a Scam.
293 2018-12-22 16:37:41 Dont confuse modern commodities as historical rights. By that logic, everyone who died of bubonic plague was just a victim of their government. As humans, we have to accept the unexpected and the unfortunate. No person has the right to escape these factors.
294 2018-12-22 16:36:20 Lastest business and financial news on stocks indices commodities training session
295 2018-12-22 16:34:18 Congrats, U have done a wonderful job!.Hope, U too would have understood the reason for the BJP's recent electoral defeat, in those five states!.The'non-reduction' of taxes on essential commodities, by the FM resulted by the price-hike, is the reason for this
296 2018-12-22 16:26:53 We need to rethink commodities, the energy to make this function has to be clean or this is a futuristic technology with no future
297 2018-12-22 16:24:40 We are able to Supply RSA with fuel, jet fuel, crude oil etc. Please send LOI on Buyers Letterhead, to lana@zansta7.com
Commodities can also be obtained.
298 2018-12-22 16:21:45 It is as it should be obvious that firing JP will have serious consequences. Treasuries curve should bear steepen. US Dollar should fall in value. Commodities & gold in particular should gain big. Local currency EM should do great. US HY should do ok. US equities likely to fall.
299 2018-12-22 16:08:18 All owners whether it’s Coca Cola or a gas station see their employees as commodities because they are. The nfl and nba are no different. If workers at a steel mill get hurt they can’t work and get no money after the disability benefits run out so please explain the difference.
300 2018-12-22 16:05:05 Oh, now you say people wouldn't make video games and other commodities, and wouldn't improve society without the investor class? Great, haven't heard that one before. But was expected if you try to give me the "human nature" argument,
301 2018-12-22 16:00:12 Ok wait, there's no fuel scarcity but the price of commodities and transportation has gone up? It's Christmas for God's sake, but greed won't give Nigerians a breather.
302 2018-12-22 15:57:03 Disagree. Oil is being devalued, other commodities following or will follow, and stocks reflect that devaluation.
303 2018-12-22 15:56:46 GST rates of 33 commodities have been cut down , Union FM.....
It's for the laypeople. He says......
തെരഞ്ഞെടുപ്പ് ആവുമ്പോ സാധാരണക്കാരെ ഓര്‍ക്കുക എന്നതാണല്ലോ ആചാരം!!
In the coming months we'll be busy concerning those.....
304 2018-12-22 15:53:07 It's a bad argument from LeBron but he's not saying that athletes are slaves. He's speaking to the mentality of owners who are overwhelmingly old money and view players as commodities to be traded
305 2018-12-22 15:49:21 @RahulGandhi  of @INCIndia  opposes reduction of slabs on commodities for poor DOGL A @ArvindKejriwal  and criminal Communists join him
306 2018-12-22 15:47:41 We wouldn't have the global south making our commodities, they could build up their economy and agriculture without us stealing and exploiting and we could produce and have workers here work to create what we now have outsourcing for.
307 2018-12-22 15:47:35 Buen artículo. Problemático pero interesante a mi juicio el uso del término commodities para referirse al prestigio y recursos. Para darle vueltas
308 2018-12-22 15:46:52 Sins forbidden in "you shall not steal" include: 

"...injustice and unfaithfulness in contracts between man and man, or in matters of trust; oppression, extortion, usury, bribery, vexatious lawsuits, unjust enclosures and depredation; engrossing commodities to enhance the price;
309 2018-12-22 15:42:21 ..Demand creates supply. This law applies to idiocies as well as commodities .
310 2018-12-22 15:38:42 @narendramodi how all political parties will survive. For 70 years we have been facing the same problem, the problem is not new and this is mainly responsible because of the flawed system and principle among them is the fact that there is no tax in the commodities that is
311 2018-12-22 15:38:32 Prices for industrial commodities are in free fall, tariffs are in place against the 2nd largest contributor to world GDP & the long end of the yield curve is falling. Central bankers are tone deaf to ignore all of these deflationary warning signs #economic
312 2018-12-22 15:32:06 As the commodities are getting costlier, human's value is becoming cheaper.
313 2018-12-22 15:23:38 In this case they'll take Alshabab and teach them how to manufacture commodities instead...!
314 2018-12-22 15:21:51 Era uma grande bolha! Vivia surfando em commodities, na era do início do real, comprando fiado, emprestando dinheiro! Hoje não temos mais, a bolha foi furada pelas pedaladas de Dilmalandra, estamos tomando calotes!Acha mesmo que conversa com dementes cm vcs?
315 2018-12-22 15:05:00 Money is a commodity... not a useless token only good for exchanging;... It differs from other commodities in being demanded mainly as a medium of exchange. - Murray Rothbard
316 2018-12-22 15:00:01 Each individual commodity, in this connexion, is to be considered as an average sample of its class. Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labour are embodied, or which can be produced in the same time, have the same value.

#Marxist #Marxism #Capital
317 2018-12-22 14:51:15 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
318 2018-12-22 14:49:20 There are certain more things that could have been taken out of 28% GST slab & moved to lower slabs,yet moving 6 commodities to lower slabs,is all welcome and appreciable #GSTCouncilsMeet
319 2018-12-22 14:49:16 It’s time. Resign before you muck more stuff up! You’ve destroyed long-standing international relations. You’ve hurt American agricultural commodities sales & decimated the stock market.

321 2018-12-22 14:46:15 What were price of commodities during before 1999 and 2015. Next level ni Jo. 4+4=8
322 2018-12-22 14:39:25 some ppl really only have u in their life to get something from u. like they don’t have friendships, they have commodities and networking contacts
323 2018-12-22 14:31:12 What's with lure of financial instruments trading incl commodities as self employment through retail brokerage.
324 2018-12-22 14:29:12 Correlation is not causation.

Energy is the economy. Energy is transformed into work by technology. Money is a call on work. Stock & oil commodities are derivatives of money. Correlation of prices of stock & oil trades is nth derivative. Everything goes back to energy = oil.
325 2018-12-22 14:28:02 Leaving toxic truck-loving, conservative Alberta which longs for the past when everyone wasn't treated equally to toxic Vancouver, BC where tech bros see people as data points, commodities and dehumanize everyone equally. Xmas trip.
326 2018-12-22 14:10:50 I assumed he meant you delete market cap from equities, commodities and crypto. The doom aspect has a morose/acerbic humor that your bull calls; while equally accurate in building market cap, lack. 

Maybe I missed the Twitter inflection of his comment. Love what you do, Brandt!
327 2018-12-22 14:10:49 I always thought this was simple.

Digital currencies are commodities and used as a medium of exchange. See money. 

Digital tokens, if the local law requires it, should be regulated if exchanged for currencies, especially if promising future gains. Every use case is different.
328 2018-12-22 14:09:52 @realDonaldTrump that’s good getting out of Syria there’s really no commodities over there to really fight about.Leave those people alone they been killing each other for thousands of years they love it so leave them alone good job
329 2018-12-22 14:02:15 Se houver crash nas commodities vamos lá p baixo...
330 2018-12-22 14:00:11 Sure they are. They treat them as replaceable commodities all the time. Some have more value than others, but all of them are replaceable.

An elite NBA player is a different animal though. They are not easily replaceable & have immense value in relation to their field.
331 2018-12-22 13:59:09 CRB já está nas mínimas...

Vai cair? O que pode acontecer?

1_ Enfraquecimento do Dólar
2_ Reajuste dos preços das commodities em outra moeda (Euro)
3_ Inflação nos EUA

Acho que é +/- isso que @hbredda fala tb
332 2018-12-22 13:58:37 Bread, fuel, high prices of commodities and availability of cash is just tips of the iceberg.. Please do not squeeze the revolt  into the symptoms.. Its deeper than this.. I pray for the people#sudan_revolt
333 2018-12-22 13:55:33 yeah, people can invest in assets other than stock - eg bonds, commodities, real estate funds, etc
334 2018-12-22 13:49:26 Faz sentido, em especial quando se pensa no petróleo. Precisa ver o quanto um dólar forte vai impactar nos preços das commodities. (Sei que não acredita em dólar forte)
335 2018-12-22 13:49:13 Please enjoy the reduction in GST rates by  @GST_Council but do not Elect back this Govt. They have scrwed the common man for 4.5 years with exorbitant rates of Fuel ,Gas & Commodities
@arunjaitley @narendramodi
336 2018-12-22 13:48:05 Oh great and wise sage, please explain to us mortals this “slave mentality” you speak of so that we might know. But if you mean workers are commodities to exploit for economic gain, well then that’s every boss—even Santa.
337 2018-12-22 13:47:00 Estou otimista c/ commodities. Não por demanda física pq nesse mundo as especulações nos futuros é gigante. A posição especulativa nos futuros de comm bateu record histórico de short. Vão ter q reverter. Cada commodity tem sua história particular, mas na média acho q é pra cima.

342 2018-12-22 13:29:47 [MyWeight:66.75kg] Sharing services that share commodities and skills among consumers are spreading. Fixed fee rental services of educational toys and secondhand trading of high price children's wear are popular. C2C trading of baby-sitting and housekeeping are popular, too.

344 2018-12-22 13:25:13 The search for an alternative vision becomes an imperative act to get out of state economy and out of government that funds every single activity as from infrastructure projects, fuel & essential commodities up to job creation within public sector !! #Libya

351 2018-12-22 12:52:49 Estranho as commodities terem caído em 2016 sem as bolsas lá fora terem apresentado uma queda contundente.. deve ser efeito dos bilhões injetados pelos BCs.. acaba estimulando recompra de acoes pelas empresas mas as commodities ja sentindo a queda na demanda da economia real..

365 2018-12-22 11:28:34 Get a rescue if you want a pet.  We have, and have had, lots of animals, all no longer wanted, some mistreated. All different, but all needing a new chance.  It’s too easy get a pet on a whim. When animals are commodities they suffer.
366 2018-12-22 11:21:27 Then back on trader moni, yes it's a good venture in increasing the number of commodities you sell, but what about the issue of competition, emerging SMEs? How would they be able to pay back when they can't meet up with sales? Have you thought about it? Some of these traders..
367 2018-12-22 11:20:32 No, interest rates have actually reduced from 8% in 2014 to 6-6.5 in 2018. I think the biggest contributor was demonetisation, it flushed out a lot of black money out of the system so the real rates of commodities came down.
368 2018-12-22 11:19:50 Remember education is one of the means to help you acquire skills which you can use for trade to service a company. Those skills are valued using demand and supply like most commodities
369 2018-12-22 11:14:44 The great French revolution was caused by lack of bread. And now Bashir faces the same revolt over bread. No country can remain stable when basic commodities are not affordable or accessible.

378 2018-12-22 09:05:52 Nope, that panic was caused by trade barriers, a collapse in commodities, a real estate bubble, and central bank credit tightening.  That's nothing at all like what's happ...en...ing.  Oh shit, never mind, when do we celebrate?

382 2018-12-22 08:37:36 80% of rural population in India survive on agriculture. Govt should monitor situations to find the best solutions with collapsing prices of farm commodities. And govt should increase subsidy of organic farming, which can bring sustainable development all around.#samvadonfarmers

393 2018-12-22 06:52:44 WAREHOUSE RECEIPT SYSTEM to Agricultural and Marketing Cooperative Societies (AMCOS)... Is the system by which commodities are stored in a licensed Warehouse, the owner of the commodity receives Warehouse receipts which certifies the title of deposited commodities and grades.
394 2018-12-22 06:37:51 And now let’s look at consumption taxes. 

GST replaced a number of taxes like excise, VAT, Octroi etc. It made everything except for few sin commodities cheaper. 

Daily items like milk, cereals, meat and curd were totally exempted from the GST

404 2018-12-22 05:48:21 That's true. But very low crude price starts having negative effects also. See what happened during Jan - Mar 2016, when commodities collapsed too much. Eventually moderation in prices is better than very low prices.

420 2018-12-22 03:38:33 Ridiculous. Nobody cares about race in the NFL. If you play the position at a high level, then someone is going to start you. Good QB's are the rarest of commodities, so either they're starting or getting traded somewhere to start. There's always bad teams looking for a QB.
421 2018-12-22 03:19:53 Please don't remind me, lol.
One day we will get a sustained rally in commodities. Population growth and the continued supply destruction in markets will only make this next bull market even more spectacular.
422 2018-12-22 03:15:02 yes but they wouldnt back it with gold. The IMF want to introduce the SDR or special drawing rights which is a currency backed by a basket of commodities. This is to be avoided. Every country needs its own gold backed currency that is regulated by the free market.
423 2018-12-22 03:14:51 I watch for over one year lows in commodities.  But raised farming.  I know if prices got to low in wheat we stop growing.  Supply drops, prices up eventually.  Hopefully.  Done ok.   Im cautious.  Use do large volume day trades.  Flash crashed got me on that one.  Oh well. Lol
424 2018-12-22 03:04:54 A good government will consider her citizens first before thinking of infrastructures. When everyone dies of hunger, killing from herdsmen, who will be there to enjoy the infrastructures? Prices of commodities have sky rocket in this administration.
425 2018-12-22 02:58:42 I’m to cautious for single stock stuff I do the growth stock mutual fund stuff. Commodities market is to up and down for me. I’ve watched a few people loose their total investment in a very short time playing in it (10-20k worth). To risky for my blood.
426 2018-12-22 02:53:34 Hey, my sistas. Been so exhausted from walking around in different stores (my lower back yesterday: UGH!). We picked up a commodities box from our local Nat.

436 2018-12-22 01:36:35 It ll help to crores of Agri MSME also... Otherwise ll be net importer of Agri commodities in future, No need to required bhavanter price schemes which save lot more for Govt...it ll Promote new generation farming...Pls ban commodities in future for 2019 immediately.

438 2018-12-22 01:32:02 If Govt willing to do relief farmers then keep food commodities ban in future market to get real crop price & keep aside Sattorias..This much cheaper from farm loan waiver & think alternative to control inflation.

442 2018-12-22 01:12:23 The implementation is a lot less messier. Because the categorisation of commodities is fungible like you say. And neither babus nor current netas are capable of coming to a conclusion on categories and percentage of taxation on each of them. So basically logic and secondly 2/n
443 2018-12-22 01:11:12 There’s a bull market and a bear market. Why not a possum market?  You know, where it rolls over and plays dead. And the commodities are grits, kudzu, and possum belly.
444 2018-12-22 01:06:29 I think a number of commodities will show good yields from EV adoption. Copper, lithium etc
445 2018-12-22 00:55:00 Claro, pero lo peor de todo es que no supieron aprovechar los precios récords de los commodities, cualquier gobierno con 2 dedos de frente en esa época hubiera hecho crecer a argentina como nunca antes, pero estaban estos descerebrados que hundieron el pais.
446 2018-12-22 00:54:38 Its commodities time. And bitcoin.
447 2018-12-22 00:49:53 No. Wrong. Our currency is a Keynesian debt based currency. They only reason our money has any worth is because there are all the tax payers in this country. We need to end the Fed and get back to a commodities backed currency with Gold Silver Platinum natural gas and oil.
448 2018-12-22 00:41:47 Even if they buy and the price goes lower they back out on their purchase and we let them and have for as long as we have sold them ag Commodities
449 2018-12-22 00:22:49 Inflation is stable albeit at the lower end of the desired range, Aud falling good for commodities and other export industries. Yes price stability, currency and employment not stocks and house prices...
450 2018-12-22 00:16:32 Does it matter why the swiftness of this decline occurred? We will assign any reason for the price action.

What should signal caution is that global assets & commodities have been in year long decline. USD up 9 months. From end of Sept, Dow went from all-time high to 14-mon low
451 2018-12-22 00:12:23 This is total, absolute, 100%, no-reservations, unadulterated horseshit.

456 2018-12-21 23:50:06 The point that no one makes, especially when it comes to cotton. If the US doesn’t import cotton, it doesn’t need to export ANY cotton, we need another 5 million acres planted to cotton, (instant farm economic security). The real truth, it’s the same for most commodities.

458 2018-12-21 23:43:05 what? the whole debate is about maintaining high tax on luxuries item. When the hell i said less tax? ...taxing high end commodities (like a yatch) decrease margin ..for whom? and how does it decreases money inflow... messy & muddled. Sorry, not worth my time.
459 2018-12-21 23:40:23 You missed the point and the RBA has a role stabilising inflation/deflation of money supply/interest rates of the broader economy. Aus $ profits from commodities traded back to Aus$ all within its scope.

464 2018-12-21 22:58:57 I have to say I was a big skeptic. Raw and processed raw materials are bad targets for tariffs so long as commodities are sold into a world market. Under hard money and required account balancing every few months would change that. And each commodity reacts differently. #Soybeans
465 2018-12-21 22:54:42 Another way this is done is scarce commodities (seed, fertilizer, etc) are only sold to those that show a zanu membership card. Seen that with my eyes also.
466 2018-12-21 22:49:43 Interest rates go 2 high & the gov't can't afford 2 service the debt, let alone pay it down. Force down the prices of commodities& they're no longer affordable to produce & then major shortages appear ?

476 2018-12-21 23:43:05 what? the whole debate is about maintaining high tax on luxuries item. When the hell i said less tax? ...taxing high end commodities (like a yatch) decrease margin ..for whom? and how does it decreases money inflow... messy & muddled. Sorry, not worth my time.
477 2018-12-21 23:40:23 You missed the point and the RBA has a role stabilising inflation/deflation of money supply/interest rates of the broader economy. Aus $ profits from commodities traded back to Aus$ all within its scope.

482 2018-12-21 22:58:57 I have to say I was a big skeptic. Raw and processed raw materials are bad targets for tariffs so long as commodities are sold into a world market. Under hard money and required account balancing every few months would change that. And each commodity reacts differently. #Soybeans
483 2018-12-21 22:54:42 Another way this is done is scarce commodities (seed, fertilizer, etc) are only sold to those that show a zanu membership card. Seen that with my eyes also.
484 2018-12-21 22:49:43 Interest rates go 2 high & the gov't can't afford 2 service the debt, let alone pay it down. Force down the prices of commodities& they're no longer affordable to produce & then major shortages appear ? 

We're in for a shock 2 the system at some point. Hard 2 c any way out.

499 2018-12-21 21:46:26 It could be that their economies are based on different commodities than ours, and are therefore unable to just copy our policies, because ours are tuned to the goods and services we provide. It could also be that the CBO understands this better than you.

501 2018-12-21 21:36:16 UBI studies: Chicago = sample size too small, South America = not comparable economy

UBI isnt housing and food security. Marginal reactionary rent raises hurt the very poor most = France & gas tax. 

End rental economy & solve hunger. Then UBI becomes a commodities boost.
502 2018-12-21 21:29:08 That is a good point and true. Another option would be to diversify away from global commodities so that suppliers have more pricing power. In the end, a diversity of approaches will be required, especially with climate change making single crops increasingly risky.

590 2018-12-21 13:36:20 Prices of commodities are crashing. Prices of foodstuffs are crashing & this is the only Christmas period in a long while that I didn't hear Nigerians grumbling & screaming that things are very expensive.
591 2018-12-21 13:35:48 Ja, esa palabra la inventaron para cagar gente, dejen de ser tan cipayos, solo algunos países productores de materia prima y recursos naturales pagan a valor "commodities", es como venderle a tus propios hijos la comida a precio de lista si tenés un restaurante
592 2018-12-21 13:33:11 Weird since I know a Muslim who celebrates Christmas with his Christian wife. Funny story: he's a commodities trader and called me once saying "got you two free racks of ribs but you have to come get them tonight" bc he couldn't keep them in his fridge.
593 2018-12-21 13:23:18 CLP cerró en 690,80 y hoy abre al alza en 692,00 siguiendo la preocupación por el crecimiento, debido a que las menores alzas de tasas en USA  es un menor crecimiento el impacto en commodities y monedas emergentes es negativo.
594 2018-12-21 13:13:21 OK. Fair point. How much are price of commodities now? How much was pump price same time previous administration?

597 2018-12-21 13:05:14 Ok, here's where it's odd. The materials aren't Commodities, although they often sound like one. Considering you can buy gold, silver etc you'd think you'd be able to buy nickel, or iron. But no... Materials are separate, and take up no cargo space.

601 2018-12-21 12:45:21 My question is, who was insinuating Georgia doesn’t have hoops talent? If nothing else, SC is the one constantly having to prove itself along with Morgan Co. being one of Georgia’s proven commodities.

611 2018-12-21 12:05:34 My fear aboutghese proposals is that they result only in increased taxes for commodities enjoyed by already impoverished members of society. Why not focus on educating individuals, reduction of the ability to get addictive substances (cigarettes, tobacco) especially from students

615 2018-12-21 11:36:01 Mr. FM Ji, Then why Petrol/Diesel not under GST? As we all know how pathetic GST introduction without thinking of commodities. Ex. Food GST priced higher and brought to lower.
616 2018-12-21 11:34:11 First world problems... In the UK we're triggered by signs. Meanwhile in other parts of the world women and girls are commodities to be traded and abused

Hon. Minister Sir ,
Please put request of Sr. Citizens from non govt. sector, forPension of min. 7.5k with D.A. p/m . Last 5 Yrs we are receiving only Rs.2023/- .There is a price rise on all Commodities. But our earning is fixed and health liabilities increasing .
618 2018-12-21 11:18:14 I developed a computer program to trade risk markets ( commodities Metals, energy, stocks, bonds, Fx etc)  without human interference. My program is very successful with a proven very successful track record. So rest assured you are very wrong as to my knowledge and it’s sources.
619 2018-12-21 10:58:54 Their work over the festive period provides us all with the valuable commodities we take for granted such as coal, the equipment for infrastructure improvements, the food and drink on our tables, and even the gifts under our trees.

623 2018-12-21 10:25:13 EUA crescem bastante justamente pq commodities estavam baratas. Commodities é custo, é freio, pra economia americana. Qdo commodities voam de preço, é fim da linha cíclica para os EUA.
624 2018-12-21 10:09:01 Please don't be bothered about them sir. They should ask Mummy and Daddy about  the days of "Essential Commodities" in Nigeria. We warned them but they won't listen. A dog fated to get lost will not hear the hunter's whistle.
625 2018-12-21 09:57:09 Imposition of GST with exorbitant rates on various essential commodities or things is itself a Supid and mindless, mind boggling idea...and it has affected seriously the masses of middle class Business and population having negative impact on poll prospect s in 2019 on BJP.
626 2018-12-21 09:54:43 Veremos o quanto essa defesa será eficiente. Se o Brasil não adotar as práticas de produção sustentáveis e ecológicas  aceitas internacionalmente, a tendência é ficar refém dos commodities e tutelado pelos norte-americanos.

632 2018-12-21 09:14:11 yes the indirect tax was 31 % and that's why UPA wanted to implement GST with 18 % tax for all commodities. Don't act like a clown yourself.

637 2018-12-21 08:32:05 Good insights. I think copper prices might do quite well in the next few years as well as other commodities, perhaps uranium is the one I have most conviction on. Recession fears have already been priced in I guess so unless there’s another 2008 (unlikely imo) they’ll do well
638 2018-12-21 08:30:36 It’s just a trailer at the beginning of the @INCIndia rule in states. Hitherto unheard of shortages of essential items and commodities has started surfacing. Wait for the full picture when RaGa’s goons and agents will be in full control of everything people need.

640 2018-12-21 08:22:39 Se o país sofrer retaliações dos dois maiores compradores de commodities brasileiras por causa das loucuras do novo governo, como pretendem fazer o reequilíbrio entre produção e consumo desses produtos?
641 2018-12-21 08:21:56 Sabe agricultura? É commodities ou seja, basicamente matéria prima com baixo valor agregado... O Brasil já é umas das referências em tecnologia agrária o que ele precisa agora é de expansão industrial e não mais privilégios para um setor já desenvolvido..
642 2018-12-21 08:18:06 If the Zim economy under ED is better and more functional than under uncle Bob, why is that we  have worse economic and fuel crises than during Mugabe's last days in office; where is production, production, exportst and exports to sustain imports of FUEL and other commodities!
643 2018-12-21 08:12:49 In the world of economists demand and supply determines the price of commodities, but not in the world of an average Igbo’s trader or transporter. This year there is no fuel scarcity, so why is transport fare to East N13k, why does Igbo’s love exploitation.
644 2018-12-21 07:58:21 In the eyes of zanu media everything is well in zimbabwe fuel we have more than enough, basic commodities are there, economy is growing, prices are dropping, mega deals, to them zim is perfect but in reality people are crying

Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Panonetsa Mangudya has claimed that the increase in prices of commodities is caused by the increase in money supply available in the pockets of Zimbabweans which increases their spending habits.

674 2018-12-21 04:26:51 It's as if Cambridge Theory on Monetary Economics is false, and that value is derived from transactional utility. Like I've been saying since 2013... Low liquidity hard assets have never been a store of value. Cryptocurrencies are more akin to frictionless commodities.
675 2018-12-21 04:20:24 Financial advisors said that commodities and real estate both perform really well even during a recession, so I tried investing in them. But, so far, the mutual fund I am investing in has lost a few hundred dollars. There are a lot of people giving bad advice.
676 2018-12-21 04:15:56 Mr Minister maybe you have forgotten. Prices of basic commodities have shot up and schools especially boarding ones will be put on a tight corner. Do you our kids to hate us thinking that we have sent them to suffer hunger or else we tell them that your admin has failed. Wake up
677 2018-12-21 04:14:47 Absolutely right. If govt is honestly serious about farmers, then it should stop these short term politically motivated gimmicks. The best solution to their problem is to provide them cheaper irrigation sources by harnessing rivers, and reasonable MSP for all commodities.
678 2018-12-21 04:14:47 The things that POC got made front of and still do are created into commodities. It's disgusting and degrading this generation is literally not any better than the previous let's be real

680 2018-12-21 04:10:45 @realDonaldTrump Thank you so much for trying to reform Food Stamps and Welfare. Please go back to commodities!!! If they are hungry enough then they will be grateful for this! Food stamps are abused!!! They eat better than those of us working.

682 2018-12-21 03:54:14 But the norm is hiring tired guys that are known commodities and going 8-8. I'd rather take a chance.
683 2018-12-21 03:41:35 I heard she watched the commodities market and acted up in peak years.
684 2018-12-21 03:41:08 Common sense, that most rare of commodities, has finally surfaced. No deal, the WTO option, does not require a hard border. Already deals are being struck to facilitate trade under “WTO No Deal”, the Swiss being the first example.

687 2018-12-21 03:13:15 But why then differentiate between branded vs. unbranded basic commodities which is a common man’s right?
688 2018-12-21 02:55:36 I think essential commodities are treated with low tax rate because it is essential for all.But luxury commodities are treated as high rate tax because it is used by rich person who had enough money in their hand.
689 2018-12-21 02:53:40 We’re at .10 until the yield curve for 2/10 bonds goes inverse. When I brought this up the first time we were at .11. Recession of 2008 proportion upcoming in 2-3 years maybe less depending on panic & algorithmic selling. Offload debt, hoard commodities. The sky IS falling.

697 2018-12-21 01:41:30 En Argentina, las elecciones las definen dos factores: la tasa de la FED y el precio de los commodities.
698 2018-12-21 01:35:40 Cramer is full of poppycock . Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money . Money does not grow on trees   . It must be produced. Interest rates should be determined just as all other commodities are : By  supply and demand for the product .
699 2018-12-21 01:32:05 I’m a little disturbed by the language in this piece. It makes it seem like people are objects and commodities.

701 2018-12-21 01:09:49 One of the perils on relying on a commodities-driven economy. Wake up to the real world where commodity "cartels" (like OPEC) don't work. Because, for commodities suppliers, it's everyone for himself!.. @teresakok
