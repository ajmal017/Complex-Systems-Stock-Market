3 2018-09-27 23:59:44 Its so simple but nobody gives it a thought. The trees eventually become the oil we are syphoning from the Earth like moronic black gold addicts. this oil acts as a coolant, the more we remove, the more volcanic activity we will see. Its fucking obvious and Im only a dumb mug.

42 2018-09-27 23:57:33 More oil in the Rocky Mountains than in the entire house of Saud!
43 2018-09-27 23:57:22 Even if oil is confirmed- it will only benefit few pple like you- who are in Zanu.. same as diamonds  they didn’t benefit anyone except Zanu pf elite..A lot of Zimbabweans were killed trying to help themselves with that diamond.. There is nothing for us to celebrate- Zanu oil.
44 2018-09-27 23:57:09 I'm not actually paying a HANDWRITTEN oil bill. Pay for toner with all your dirty oil money, you cheap cunts.
45 2018-09-27 23:57:04 Lol! You don't think you're being selfish here ? I don't civil servants make up our entire population. If we take all our money gotten from the sale of oil and give you guys, what will the rest of us see?

53 2018-09-27 23:55:48 Our coconut oil is genuine and useful for multiple purposes. You can use it on your skin or take it in with your food.
54 2018-09-27 23:55:44 Boy I’m not paying attention much got my own work issues to have me consumed ...they needed to restructure and operate at a smaller scale is what I think not close down it gonna put a burden on ppl living here now plus extra expense on gas and oil

57 2018-09-27 23:55:29 Who ever manages the oil market now is not as efficient and the Seven sister or the Railroad commission, But if you think we had volatility in the last 40 years, it will be worse with the manager.   Ironically, Trump is trying to manage the market too!

70 2018-09-27 23:54:33 I heard on WGN radio in Chicago that oil companies pay an astounding amount of money into a fund that is suppose to go to NTL Parks and other Nature and Wildlife entities. They do so to have the right to drill off shore. Where is all of this money?

77 2018-09-27 23:54:09 Add a little jam to your whipped cream; it'll whip faster and easier.

Add a little mustard to your dressings; it makes the oil and acid emulsify almost immediately.

Add a little mustard to your cheese sauce; it makes it taste cheesier.

Add a little coffee to your chocolate.

80 2018-09-27 23:53:56 One thing I miss about Stamford, the hot oil with sausage from Colony.
81 2018-09-27 23:53:54 The only thing Saudi Arabia teaches is despotism & sectarian hatred. You are the source code of terrorism, an apocalypse for pluralism in the Islamic faith. When oil ends you’ll be back in the desert under canvas & living on dates. The world despises your sad, racist ignorance.
82 2018-09-27 23:53:48 Many people in this room are suffering because of British Petroleum. Almost the entire room raised their hand when asked “how many of you have had to put someone in the ground due to cancers from the oil spill?”  #justiceforBPvictims

86 2018-09-27 23:53:24 No they don’t export, but they do produce around 10 mbbd. (As much as KSA after the Saudi Russian agreement) However, US consumes 20 mbbd this they import oil

92 2018-09-27 23:53:12 Squishy R's defect, will dems stop here, and let a man they view as a rapist continue to sit on DC court, proving all this was political? Do they care about those optics?

98 2018-09-27 23:52:16 Ever since I was a kid, the price of oil and a strong US dollar have been the major factors affecting inflation & exchange rate. Funny how some things don't change.

117 2018-09-27 23:49:08 When you get your car a fresh oil change
118 2018-09-27 23:48:47 I don't remember the exact date I got my oil changed a couple of weeks ago, but I certainly would not ever forget something as horrific as what Judge Kavanaugh did to Dr. Ford.

121 2018-09-27 23:48:37 Here's my question, if America is America First, and we are not globalists, then why do we have any say about any country, how they govern, how they release their oil, how they fight their wars. Who are we to tell other nations they can't develop nuclear weapons.

130 2018-09-27 23:47:42 Being in the oil field makes me mad cause everyone speaks Spanish and my mom and dad never taught me. They said I didn’t wanna learn but I feel like they were just lazy. Smh

135 2018-09-27 23:47:23 that was the major problem and made the situation unacceptable. Oil, water, metal chips and sundry debris should not be all over the floor; such conditions increase the chance for accidents and end up creating a dirty environment in the shop that gets on clothes,

136 2018-09-27 23:47:14 How about the war criminals Cheney and Rumsfeld in the bush administration- they basically massacred 3,000 people on our own soil and wrote a fake narrative about the axis of evil, and got us into war with Iraq for oil.

163 2018-09-27 23:44:32 Looking like my thing. It's over. He has come a long time that they're bringing oil from Gaddafi. He brought it up. People are going to rebuild our depleted military.
164 2018-09-27 23:44:01 Have it in a sandwich. With olive oil.
165 2018-09-27 23:43:54 We bout to get wash off and wunna arguing tuna in water vs water in oil?Like tuna in oil is any good smh

167 2018-09-27 23:43:36 I give my 2 cats CTFO HEMP OIL also, it's AMAZING 
168 2018-09-27 23:43:33 I wish this was as true as you seem to believe. I don't understand why people seem to struggle to understand we need oil to transition us beyond. Why can we not build a pipeline and require all revenue goes to financing the transition to a post oil world?
169 2018-09-27 23:43:21 I’m just getting started!
Next up: body/shower oil 
and a true (and natural) oil cleansing formula. 
Final stages of formulation and testing...

172 2018-09-27 23:42:55 After all of the trauma of today's hearings, I'm going to massage some heated heat coconut oil into my skin, stretch out all the tension in my body, cry, drink some tea, and go to sleep early.
173 2018-09-27 23:42:49 someone said to put coconut oil in my bath when I run it an now I’m slipping all over this mf lol my skin is soft tho
174 2018-09-27 23:42:34 Especially in mice studies where there is a nice nutritious mix of soy oil and sugar.
175 2018-09-27 23:42:34 Y'all eat tuna in oil??? Y'all nasty NASTY.
176 2018-09-27 23:42:06 I never said I had proof. But his actions are suspicious! That role model explanation is hog wash.  But hey! I got some swamp land for sale, you interested, I believe there is oil on the land. LMAO!
177 2018-09-27 23:41:52 Warm sweet oil always does the trick.

179 2018-09-27 23:41:34 I see nothing out there with oil and auto companies that says they have gotten Green Energy religion. They all have stranded assets to monetize unlike $TSLA.
180 2018-09-27 23:41:16 Or cbd oil works wonders too
181 2018-09-27 23:41:15 By virtue of just that, her entire testimony should be discarded.
182 2018-09-27 23:41:06 Don't go far on em. Aprox 400km max but mostly much less as we swap engines about like mad and they get new oil each time.

192 2018-09-27 23:39:57 I am not even against our oil and gas industry per se. But when I see the mess in Alberta, tailings ponds etc., while the companies just run away with the money, it just shows you the respect they have for the land and by extension, us. I am an optimist.

200 2018-09-27 23:38:45 @soccercitysd is everything that is wrong in politics today. Nothing but half truths and smear campaigning. Even in a one on one discussion with Nick Stone it is impossible to obtain any honesty. These guys are the definition of snake oil salesmen.
201 2018-09-27 23:38:03 Now she can get that 2nd front door she's always wanted
202 2018-09-27 23:37:42 Is this the same world that wants to pump every last drop of oil out of the ground? If companies like $TSLA go away, every legacy oil/auto company will declare solar/wind/battery/EV a "failed" experiment and resume pumping with gusto.

222 2018-09-27 23:34:34 True, but as Bill O'Reilly said, Support our Troop's or shut up. It had noting to do with the troops. It was US POLICY. Bombing counties to push oil lines and for Israel. Had nothing to do with Soldiers. Kissinger - "Military men are dumb stupid animal's." PAWN's as he said.

238 2018-09-27 23:32:53 what i always say got me started was double cleansing - aka combining an oil based cleanser with a low ph foaming cleanser.  with just that I saw leaps and bounds forward and it just felt straight up awesome.
239 2018-09-27 23:32:48 it shows that I don't care for a corrupt government that would kill its own people in order to slaughter millions of people in another country who have done nothing wrong so they could Rob them of gold and oil. I'm sorry you and I disagree on this, but you

255 2018-09-27 23:30:24 Hmm. Took an oil painting class yesterday which I enjoyed. But there is no painting storage there (wasn't really expecting, but hoping). So now my condo smells like an oil painting, which is exactly why I've not done any since I've been living here. Not sure what to do.

So do they ride a push bike, have they ever played in a playground, maybe even climbed a tree. Heck I get injured gardening or checking the oil in the car. Girls can do anything ask Mike Sheahan.

268 2018-09-27 23:29:24 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
269 2018-09-27 23:29:21 They seem not to realize that the big oil companies are investing in hydrogen, for example.

298 2018-09-27 23:25:28 It's just trader Joe's ginger brew with Crown Royal in it.  If I'm feeling fancy I put a lime wedge or a drop of lime essential oil in!
299 2018-09-27 23:25:19 Clove oil? Really helps toothache.
300 2018-09-27 23:25:16 Castor oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil and argan oil, especially in your scalp. Probably a good few inches cut off. No sulfates, silicones, parabens, mineral oil in your shampoo or conditioner either as those will inhibit all the hard work you do with deep conditioners etc.
301 2018-09-27 23:25:12 gunakan pelembut kulit sepatu/mink oil. Minyak ini hanya digunakan pada sepatu futsal berbahan kulit untuk menjaga warna dan kondisi kulit.
302 2018-09-27 23:24:54 Yes.
303 2018-09-27 23:24:51 Gina's taking concrete steps to achieve a clean energy future: 

First and only state with an operational off-shore wind farm 
Created 5,500 green jobs since 2015 
Committed to a future of offshore wind power – not offshore oil drilling

304 2018-09-27 23:24:48 the few things keeping from kermiting is waiting on the kelela remix album, the three sophie albums we're supposed to get [two remix albums for oil of every pearl & one for most of the stuff she's been playing live lately] and that i'm seeing sophie perform on a boat tomorrow
305 2018-09-27 23:24:47 Coward.  What's next for you after this mockery you've forced upon the American people, a cabinet position & oil stocks in Russia?  POS.
306 2018-09-27 23:24:46 Hey babe! Be careful, and remember to take them everyday! Forgetting even 1-2 days, can effect your mental health HEAVILY! Happy you’re trying meds out, and if it doesn’t work for you, indica oil really helped me out! 
307 2018-09-27 23:24:44 Future: oil companies sued, supreme court sides with oil companies, planet unable to support humanity.

310 2018-09-27 23:24:28 Favorite animorphs book?
Elfangor in his prime vs Grizzley Morph Rachael. Who wins?
311 2018-09-27 23:24:22 Makes me miss Joe Barton apologizing to the CEO of BP for having to be held accountable for the deaths of 11 deep water drillers and the dumping of 550,000 barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico in the United States of America. Who are these people?
312 2018-09-27 23:24:15 The more I research the pipeline, the more I see parallels for the oil and taxi industry. Both dying, both needing to evolve and innovate in order to stay relevant.

316 2018-09-27 23:23:19 I just put lavender oil all over the place so I better sleep well tonight
317 2018-09-27 23:23:09 I always use coconut oil to make mine creamy again! Or setting spray! I am not gonna spend a whole other $20 when there’s still a few brows in that lil pot lmao
318 2018-09-27 23:23:09 It's bulletproof coffee made with rape oil. That's Canola Oil to you politically correct people.
319 2018-09-27 23:22:47 None taken. I have a vague recollection that a contributory factor to the failings in Venezuela was poor management of the state owned oil/gas company.  Next time we have a wet weekend forecast, I'll toddle off to the library for some research material.

324 2018-09-27 23:21:56 Where can I find the castor and avocado oil?
325 2018-09-27 23:21:49 Things that are made with refined oil: phones, clothes, computers, toys, EVERY FUCKING THING. Not only gasoline. The US sure are the ones to talk, being the world leader in toxic emissions. Let us be like we let you be.
326 2018-09-27 23:21:48 From quora
CBD is legal to purchase and use in PA so long as that CBD oil contains no more than 0.3% THC and comes from a Farm Bill compliant hemp producing state like Colorado or Kentucky.

I only bring it up bc you said seizures & it's supposed to work for that.
327 2018-09-27 23:21:33 The whole left is like this, like the ones that block a street and set half a town on fire and destroy peoples cars when they pull up to them, but then act shocked when the driver gets mad
328 2018-09-27 23:21:25 put your pee in a bottle and tell her it's the oil

335 2018-09-27 23:20:06 men at car repair places are funny trying to sell women into things they “need” for their car. got bombarded at least 3 times with things my car “needed” even though i literally just got an oil change last week.
336 2018-09-27 23:20:03 Scotland woke up after listening to Salmond’s pitch, and his Wipe Paper assertion that there would be up to £7.9bn in oil receipts only for it to realise £100m.

All that other stuff...you’re making up as we go!
339 2018-09-27 23:19:44 I was frying chicken and the oil popped on my eyelid.  I thought I went blind for a minute.
340 2018-09-27 23:19:22 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
341 2018-09-27 23:19:07 My Oil change is $107.15 every time
342 2018-09-27 23:19:06 An independence referendum will go ahead - irrespective of the Shetland question. Seems they’re all getting a tad excited since this oil find. The fact is- it’s still Scottish water & IF they did get Indy- they’d be entitled to some. That’s a long time away

344 2018-09-27 23:19:00 I live in Ohio but I watched the debate with him and Beto and what a snake oil salesman conman Ted Cruz is. He's what is wrong in this country in a nutshell.
345 2018-09-27 23:18:42 Olive oil = I love you ?
346 2018-09-27 23:18:42 we dont need the oil another foolish thought
347 2018-09-27 23:18:41 i burned myself really bad today at work and a customer just threw ice on my arms and then my manager covered my arms and hands in coconut oil lmao
348 2018-09-27 23:18:37 Baby oil before you shave or right after, no bumps it will be smooth...
349 2018-09-27 23:18:06 Well I can still do my own oil changes & a few other things but nothing heavy anymore! Got the knowledge, got the tools but don't have the ability anymore! I can remember when I used to do it all, pull motors & rebuild them, replace brakes, it's really depressing this get'n old!
350 2018-09-27 23:18:05 Go through your own tweets. Deleting it doesn’t count. That would be kind of like what your forefathers did to the Indians. Here, take this awful land we have no use for. That land has oil so we’re taking it back kind of shit!

356 2018-09-27 23:17:39 I get the plus oil one because it doesn’t smell as bad as the regular. It really helps itchy issues or when you need hair to grow fast.
357 2018-09-27 23:17:16 I put according to the depth of the oil. It's faster that way
358 2018-09-27 23:17:14 Anything that gets the tech giants broken up like the federal government did to Standard Oil more than a century ago is A-OK in my book.
359 2018-09-27 23:17:10 @edufeiok por favor Decile a Mendiguren que se dedique a las zapatillas pero que no opine de oil y gas, la política de Evo Morales significó una caída en las inversiones y en la proyección de producción de gas de Boliviano
360 2018-09-27 23:17:10 I put the oil in oilman. Additionally, I put the oyes in pseudocyesis.
361 2018-09-27 23:16:44 Do this about 3-4 days a week it’s inversion methods, get natural olive oil or coconut oil I personally prefer coconut oil, lay on your bed with your head hanging upside down and massage the oil into your scalp for 10 minutes, this helped me grow my roots
362 2018-09-27 23:16:44 Your brain is the kingdom of hell without anointing oil from the heart burning through it.
363 2018-09-27 23:16:34 お高いのでしょうか？
お求めやすいお値段でしたら
是非ともお教え頂きたいものです。
364 2018-09-27 23:16:29 Yep, they lost billions and are trying to recoup.  Big oil and big auto are my suspects.
365 2018-09-27 23:16:20 No doubt, but you will find that courts view murder and manslaughter differently. There's a difference between running over a squirrel accidently and doing it purposefully, and again, animal agriculture is far more destructive than palm oil, and yes you can avoid both.
366 2018-09-27 23:16:14 I forgot i had oil pills LMAO

369 2018-09-27 23:15:57 CBD oil has chilled me out so much  I used to come home everyday and stress clean my whole house. Sweep, vacuum, mop, whole nine yards. Never sit down, just go go go.  But for the last week I've spent more time with family, been less anxious, less moody
370 2018-09-27 23:15:53 Oh good grief. No. It said they didn't include it in their evaluation and that they should have. They will demonstrate the increased traffic is a rounding error. Facts man. Facts. Why are you so determined to prop up Trumps oil? Why? He's a generational asshole.
371 2018-09-27 23:15:48 Didnt take but a second for @SenFeinstein to throw Ford and her "beach friends," under the bus for being leakers.
Never considered her own staff.
Now we know why she had a Chinese spy under her employ for 20 years.
372 2018-09-27 23:15:42 Once, many years ago, a friend's dog ate a large tube of ultramarine blue oil paint, which the vet said wouldn't hurt him, and said dog pooped blue for several days. I made jokes about Jack's dog having the bluuuuues...

374 2018-09-27 23:14:53 About the charge of Soviet style propaganda: whataboutism requires intent & non-topicality. If you tweet "The coral reefs are dying" & someone responds "Can we restore them?" that's different from a shill for Big Oil responding "What about the birds killed by windmills?"

380 2018-09-27 23:13:53 行こう。
381 2018-09-27 23:13:28 Wrong again!

The recent ruling from the Federal Appeals Court was based on an appeal from groups representing the lands and waters where both the #TMX is planned to be twinned AND where oil tankers will pass from Westridge to the Anacortes. Those are the facts! #StopKM
382 2018-09-27 23:13:27 reckless oil heater makes you friendly
383 2018-09-27 23:13:22 And how about oil? Warm from the heat. I can slick your body from your head to your feet. Make ya smile ftom a simple kiss. Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish.
384 2018-09-27 23:13:22 You do have to change your oil or it gets gunked up by all the crud from the engine (it's not just about the level of oil). 

BUT, if you know how to check the oil *level* with the dipstick, you can just look at the same time--if the oil is really dark/black, it needs changed
385 2018-09-27 23:13:21 ごま油、タンスの角に指ぶつけろ。
386 2018-09-27 23:13:15 Prove there was no funding.  It's entirely possible that the source wants to remain anonymous and he honored that.  Maybe there's some Saudi inside knowledge that they're running low on oil.  They live in a desert. It makes sense to use solar and electric. Maybe they thought...
387 2018-09-27 23:13:06 I’ll take Amanda cover in grease and oil any day
388 2018-09-27 23:13:04 Also it turns out there's a limit to how much sriracha oil to use when making a stir fry and I've crossed it.
389 2018-09-27 23:13:04 I bleach every 4 weeks and use olaplex and I only wash my hair once a week. Takes a lot to get used to before your hair stops producing so much oil but it will help lots!!
390 2018-09-27 23:12:53 Get some oil based eye make up remover or some reg veg or olive oil
391 2018-09-27 23:12:41 Do we get to rip out our catalytic converters? Can we blend used motor oil to our fuel??
392 2018-09-27 23:12:33 took a big pull of that dumbfuck-juice before I started heating oil in a pan that wasn't dry yet
393 2018-09-27 23:12:31 I had that problem last Saturday.
Had to go 30 miles for an oil change.
My normal guy has been out 6 weeks.
394 2018-09-27 23:12:24 What the F is that Wesley ‘oil tank specialist’ is so f’n happy about? Can’t even watch him , he looks so happy & excited. Sico
395 2018-09-27 23:12:07 To all the big auto manufacturers and big oil behind the shorts, fuck you.  People want EVs.  People want Teslas.  I am rooting for Elon Musk.
396 2018-09-27 23:12:04 Dropped my mucinex on the floor at work today AND my new, day old,  essential oil vape broke when I came into work today 
397 2018-09-27 23:11:19 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
398 2018-09-27 23:11:15 I heard Codliver oil is good for bringing up fur balls!
399 2018-09-27 23:11:11 you have this all mapped out on your office wall, don’t you? Pins, and sticky notes and everything, right next to the Jefferson Davis oil painting.
400 2018-09-27 23:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: no crust with greasy motor oil and shrimp.
401 2018-09-27 23:11:03 there is nothing virgin about that oil.
402 2018-09-27 23:10:57 Sorry to hear it was no oil painting 
403 2018-09-27 23:10:53 So Josh it hurts episode 1: got my amazon package today. My tea tree oil shampoo has peppermint oil instead of Dead Sea salts. Dear amazon, did you even think about how this would affect my psoriasis your fucking dead to me. See you next week on SJIH
404 2018-09-27 23:10:44 おはようございます！！！
405 2018-09-27 23:10:38 i still have the 8hr, 8k exp ones that be costing 800 oil, literally doing them at least once a week
406 2018-09-27 23:10:35 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
407 2018-09-27 23:10:32 Also worth noting that the methane zones in Los Angeles resulted from past oil extraction. So if BHHS has one under campus, it's a self inflicted wound.
408 2018-09-27 23:10:24 Here’s some advice. Take two weeks off then quit ya coconut oil freak.
409 2018-09-27 23:10:21 is big oil sponsoring ?
410 2018-09-27 23:10:15 Endless oil story
411 2018-09-27 23:10:13 In the 2014 #AKgov #akelect campaign there was a hidden fiscal issue. None of the candidates talked about falling $$oil. This cycle there is a similar issue. None are talking about refilling the CBR. It is just as consequential. As $$oil/production recover, its time. #akleg
412 2018-09-27 23:10:05 For dinner I'll have chicken breast stir fry with green onions, egg, and korean spicy sauce served over brown rice. All cooked in sesame oil.

414 2018-09-27 23:09:35 Oil and gas stocks are ripping this week and I think it’s just starting...I guess it’s their turn... looking forward to your blog post to compare to my notes.
415 2018-09-27 23:09:18 May not, but credibility comes in degrees.
416 2018-09-27 23:09:08 I watched it that night! No one can tell you how much oil there is, but if you can’t get people to invest then you can’t drill for oil. The reason I did believe (after the referendum) was because the first minister Nicola sturgeon was out trying to get people to invest in oil!
417 2018-09-27 23:09:07 “Leftovers and Whatever I Find” — tonight.

-red onions sautéed in olive oil
-boiled Brussels sprouts with salt and pepper
418 2018-09-27 23:09:00 I fasho gotta get my oil changed before I hit 70,000 miles
419 2018-09-27 23:08:57 It's not a reschedule of CBD per se, only of Epidiolex. I doubt many CBD oil producers plan on going the FDA approval route...
420 2018-09-27 23:08:50 Coconut oil really is the cure for it all

I usually add some sort of essence to make it smell nice.
427 2018-09-27 23:07:56 As someone who a. Had a chip-pan of boiling oil explode in their face (32 years ago almost to the day on my 16th birthday) and b. Watched tonight’s #bbcqt. Go with the fryer - much less painful.
428 2018-09-27 23:07:43 Oil ?
429 2018-09-27 23:07:42 inaapo drown them in oil charot
430 2018-09-27 23:07:33 No oil.. = preparation.
431 2018-09-27 23:07:24 Ann, I can use a computer to make any graph say what I want, you know?  I have posted a recent, real study saying Coconut oil is not advised in countries who eat a lot of saturated fats,  but  Vegetarian countries may benefit from it.  I think you are protesting a bit too much.
432 2018-09-27 23:07:19 That's always been my understanding. I used to make it out of rice flour and canola oil to throw to monkeys. Couldn't use salt, but it worked fine.
433 2018-09-27 23:07:10 Even if said meddling puts us in a better position for something bigger?  Like our involvement in the middle east keeps us in the middle of the supply chain for oil. It pays to meddle some times. We are being left out of the new silk road and it's gonna bite us in the ass

435 2018-09-27 23:06:54 Incredible that they claim to be worried about health and safety impacts when they literally have an oil well on their campus.
436 2018-09-27 23:06:34 Dawg I need a oil change
437 2018-09-27 23:06:19 I'm not sorry to inform you but, until the United States acknowledges the fact that it was their own doing, in order to perpetuate wars over oil and gold in the Middle East. Most reasonable people are not going to give a fuck what other people do during that 'moment of silence.'
438 2018-09-27 23:06:16 Have you considered branching out to cover coconut oil?
439 2018-09-27 23:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.

447 2018-09-27 23:05:02 Oil has a negative correlation with USD/CAD of about 93% between 2000 through 2016.

When oil goes up, USD/CAD goes down. When oil goes down, USD/CAD goes up.

458 2018-09-27 23:03:33 I know basic twitter jokes about this constantly, but I went to Target for a belt for Brian and left with two pairs of shoes, a cardigan, measuring cups, liquid DayQuil, toothpaste, an olive oil mister, and two shirts  That place is a damn trap.
459 2018-09-27 23:03:29 I'm not talking terrorism, and I'm not talking actions that impact hospitals and their backup systems. But I am talking about preventing the refueling of vehicles, blockading and shutting down oil refineries, disabling coal conveyors, turning. Making fossil fuels unworkable.
460 2018-09-27 23:03:27 Canada’s economy is dependent on exports, with about 85% of its exports going to its big brother down south, the U.S.

Because of this, USD/CAD can be greatly affected by how U.S. consumers react to changes in oil prices.

473 2018-09-27 23:02:04 Ummmm....no. We need to pump as much oil as possible providing jobs for Amercans and reducing energy costs that reduce the cost of all goods we buy. And, it harms Russia they are a petroleum based economy.

505 2018-09-27 22:58:41 You know you a hoe when you gotta get an oil change every month
506 2018-09-27 22:58:39 Climate change is happening regardless of development of oil sands or not. Why oppose one of the most responsible countries from benefiting financially and supporting some with among the worst human rights records?
507 2018-09-27 22:58:37 This does nothing for you and everything for an oil industry leader. You are a sheep and deserve the worst for following so willingly
508 2018-09-27 22:58:26 Oil?
509 2018-09-27 22:58:20 Oil and water don't mix, you can't be messy and anointed at the same time. Think about that.
510 2018-09-27 22:57:53 Iran was a democracy, until US and CIA overthrew it in 1953 because they decided to nationalize their oil, which lead to the revolution. And how is israel stable? They armed ISIS (known fact) provided medical aid for them and also USS liberty and 5 dancing Israeli mossad 9/11
511 2018-09-27 22:57:41 Don't believe a word Theresa May says about guarding the fishermen, what about when she said the oil was finished and also the promised 13 Frigates for the Clyde Shipyards. More oil discovered and where are the Frigates Theresa. Anything May/ Corbyn say take with a pinch of salt.

532 2018-09-27 22:54:10 Hey, that's makes sense to me to help reduce the deficit. oil companies get enough breaks from Uncle Sam. It is time they pay their dues. Cruz helped dump this big deficit on the American people and he should pay for it damn lying, crying Ted

581 2018-09-27 22:48:11 Out him for being a p-hound? That dude lays more pipe than an oil company on a reservation.
582 2018-09-27 22:48:01 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
583 2018-09-27 22:47:59 ELIOT: What brings Chloe Price to the beach on a Saturday morning? Nothing colossal, I bet.
CHLOE: I burned the midnight oil.
ELIOT: Wait, really? Free candy.
584 2018-09-27 22:47:50 I was in such a bad mood this morning that Erin threw her stress away essential oil at me and said "I think you need this"

595 2018-09-27 22:46:15 Can u show me any nuclear bases south of the border. Can u show me how much electricity is generated north and then dispelled on national grid south of the border. What about the supposed deminished oil and whiskeys revenues etc. The subsidies we get are a pittance
596 2018-09-27 22:46:15 New skin care routine, goingbto sound wild but hear me out. 

Boiling oil, when it pops you get the nice splotchy red marks all over your skin and it’s just super refreshing!
597 2018-09-27 22:46:13 YALL. Our essential oils are 50% off!!!  I’m SCREAMING. The kit that includes a diffuser and 4 oils that retails $150 is on sale for $47  individual oils are only $10, and coconut oil is $25 and you’ll get one FREE. this deal is insane! 
598 2018-09-27 22:45:52 Tune up an oil change

604 2018-09-27 22:45:16 two freaking hours for an oil change

607 2018-09-27 22:45:08 Bought an essential oil necklace today and it was hands down the best decision I’ve made all week.
608 2018-09-27 22:44:43 It's hard trying to have face to face discussions about foreign policy with left leaning voters. I can barely get a word in bc they just ramble about "US intervention", "we want the oil", "we overthrow 'elected' governments" yadda yadda.
609 2018-09-27 22:44:39 i found it, the worst place on earth. it’s this oil change waiting room with only two other people, while the tv broadcasts christine blasey ford’s vivid retelling of being sexually assaulted by a supreme court judge nominee. i would like to die please
610 2018-09-27 22:44:32 Drilling, fracking, acidisation, reinjection risk seismic instability. Oil & gas has monopolised the energy business & produced toxic bi-products that we are all obliged to use. It is poetic to use those products to challenge you.
Cleaner sources of energy exist. Invest in those.

627 2018-09-27 22:43:11 @getintotheweeds Guys I have a combination of a question and a complaint.  I know I asked you guys earlier today about the term " on the oil " and what it meant.  I came back and found it missing. Why was it deleted?  Whose decision was it ? Or were you asked to and by whom?
628 2018-09-27 22:43:10 Why am i so restless? is just 15 more mins to Red Oil time...
629 2018-09-27 22:42:59 Kamala Harris and Corey Booker must be leakimg oil. That smug Arrogance is nauseating. #KavanaughHearings

634 2018-09-27 22:42:40 That’s BS @caitoz . Soros armed the neo- Nazis in the Ukraine through McCain, Biden and Graham. Just a regular government topple. Obama was on board. Biden got the oil play.

641 2018-09-27 22:41:18 With the price of oil at current levels, Scotland is a net recipient of government funds, even including oil taxes.  Would the EU replace these funds, especially with Spain ready to make Scotland joining the EU a long and painful process?

664 2018-09-27 22:38:16 2/ let's say I buy crude oil as a 1 month bet.  Then I sell crude oil as a 5 minute trade and then do similar short trades a thousand times.  Why would I care at all about the one month bet when thinking about the 5 minute bets?  They're unrelated.

666 2018-09-27 22:38:08 @KamalaHarris you showed your ignorance. A Polygraph is pure snake oil.
667 2018-09-27 22:38:08 Seriously...are there two more phony, power-hungry, fake, snake oil politicians than Kamala Harris and Corey Booker? Well, there are but those two certainly stand out.
668 2018-09-27 22:38:00 Time to get violent right back.
669 2018-09-27 22:37:57 The primary driver of the current economic difficulties in Venezuela is the fall in the price of oil due to US fracking technology. Some bad choices were also made and I'm sure there is corruption (as there is in ALL governments...especially those in Central and S. America).
670 2018-09-27 22:37:56 I agree!
671 2018-09-27 22:37:55 I was at the first Oil Kings game there a couple of years ago.  The ice cold air blew right on our section.  It was unbelievable for a modern arena

675 2018-09-27 22:37:02 Boyzee especially I mean why would anyone want to read his crap. He's been spouting the same shite for along time in there and doesn't understand the word overkill. He just becomes nothing. You know. Noise.
676 2018-09-27 22:37:01 Elon Musk maybe talented. But he is a slime. Sorry. He kind of reeks of snake oil.

678 2018-09-27 22:36:41 It actually was a mrchanical engineering lead team, that also was in line with GHWB that wanted iraqs oil. That same group, developed a nuclear war head missle in late 1990's and early 2000's that later became spacex. Texas A&M was the school on the lead, and was a Proud Nazi

683 2018-09-27 22:35:39 @tedcruz Mr. Oil Slick is talking about integrity 
684 2018-09-27 22:35:31 I would rather run through a football field of shattered glass than get my oil changed as a female. Why did that just take an hour to do!?

687 2018-09-27 22:35:17 So slick it's a goddamned oil spill, the way every GOP member is talking about the when/where/how of information and lack of investigation, rather than the subject of whether or not these accusations are credible/disqualifying.

691 2018-09-27 22:35:00 nice okay ! i love making pork chops w/ rice pilaf, i season w salt pepper and garlic and pan fry chops in veg oil, start rice pilaf (boxed, follow directions) in same pan and lay the pork chops in the water to simmer w/ the rice. keeps the chops moist!
692 2018-09-27 22:34:58 He has. It’s a damn shame they don’t sue all the fake news folk for putting a the crap out there about EVs when they clearly want to influence the market and kill off EVs to keep killing us off by continuing to make billions from oil.

Not sure having a sense of class and cleanliness had much to do with environment. Hows the plastic phone made from oil doing?

700 2018-09-27 22:33:47 Sen Ted Cruz should realize that republican majority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, much like Donald Trump, in this SCOTUS hearing case — as in many others — chronically pour oil on a fire and then blame others for the explosion. Dumpster fire after dumpster fire.
701 2018-09-27 22:33:28 And another soapbox snake @tedcruz! Looks like he bathes in snake oil and tries.....OH YEEES  I SAY TRIIIIIES to sound like a soapbox preacher!

715 2018-09-27 22:32:02 Hot oil treatments on the scalp often.  Hair oil will help.

718 2018-09-27 22:31:58 @tedcruz is the dirty residue at the bottom of an oil pan in human form.
719 2018-09-27 22:31:57 My moms soon needs to hear this right now:

Your oil light just came on, don’t forget to change your shit you dumbass.
720 2018-09-27 22:31:50 It seems to me that all country's where war is taking place is Muslim oriented. Thee bigger picture comes to play when its about land or oil.
721 2018-09-27 22:31:44 Shane, that was because the price of a barrel of oil was over $130 at the time, it is currently just over  $80 my point still stands, fuel is 5p a litre more because of the referendum and the fall in the value of the pound.
722 2018-09-27 22:31:35 Seattle couple: You work in the oil and gas industry? How does that make you feel? I couldn’t imagine working in that polluting industry. 
Me: Well, pretty damn good every other Friday of the month!   Kaylee later that evening: OMG I can’t believe you told them that!
723 2018-09-27 22:31:33 It is like the oil that runs down the beard of Aaron, unto the hem of his garment...
724 2018-09-27 22:31:24 Leave the oil in the pan and let that aroma fill your place for a week
725 2018-09-27 22:31:22 Oil dey ur head abeg
726 2018-09-27 22:31:20 Turning 30 as a broke musician means spending any birthday money you get on an oil change and new strings... both of which are long overdue
727 2018-09-27 22:31:10 ..attacks. korean war was the same thing. Yemen, Lebenon, Aghanistan has the two offenses i discussed. Iraq in 1991, was ghwb hate of Iraqs oil money, iraq in 2003, was GWB hate of Hussein requesting sanctions against u.s. for afghanistan. Afghanistan was a mixed, confused,
728 2018-09-27 22:31:00 "Love cannot endure indifference It needs to be wanted Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low"
729 2018-09-27 22:30:58 As in ehn? The way these guys are digging deep into this case, they'd discover oil.
730 2018-09-27 22:30:46 The first woman to disrupt the integrity of his oil slick steals his powers
731 2018-09-27 22:30:40 I never feel more incompetent then when I go to get an oil change. Lol
732 2018-09-27 22:30:39 I have some massage bars from lush, a essential oil, a mini book of mindfulness, worry card things and some fiddle toys!

738 2018-09-27 22:30:24 Him and his oil wrestling buddy Ruth Davidson, Shhhh dont mention ze dark money ;)
739 2018-09-27 22:30:11 And now being joined by the human oil stain, Ted Cruz.
740 2018-09-27 22:30:03 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
741 2018-09-27 22:30:01 Rafael, when you speak, my innards rumble, my eyes burn, and my ears start ringing. All I can hear is a caricature of a lying (Ted) snake oil salesman. Texas, how could you? #BetoForSenate #BetoforTX
742 2018-09-27 22:30:00 They are selling snake oil.
743 2018-09-27 22:29:59 This is all so foul. Ted Cruz comes through over the radio like an oil.
744 2018-09-27 22:29:57 I mad I left my oil
745 2018-09-27 22:29:51 Human oil slick @tedcruz has balls talking about the Dems attacking Kavanaugh. Evidently he has forgotten the attacks by Donald Trump on Cruz's wife and father.
746 2018-09-27 22:29:49 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
747 2018-09-27 22:29:41 You left out the bottle of snake oil.
748 2018-09-27 22:29:40 CBD with less than .1% THC in formulation is now schedule 5 in the USA. CBD will be an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API ) in Canada. Also in the USA - CBD or “hemp oil” in formulation is sold as a food supplement no schedule

752 2018-09-27 22:29:18 Love @CoryBooker from the great state of NJ and now we have Mr. Haney, the snake oil salesmen from Green Acres the most disingenuous human being on the face of the Earth @tedcruz

755 2018-09-27 22:29:00 The first thing is to change your pillowcase every week. Pillowcases are breeding grounds for bacteria. Just think makeup, oil from skin and hair, etc. Changing it once a week limits this.
756 2018-09-27 22:28:57 It's so weird watching these American cooking videos where they'd just coat their chicken w olive oil, salt and sprinkle some dry seasoning pop it in the oven then say it's delicious

761 2018-09-27 22:28:12 Why does Dawn advertise with baby ducks? It’s cute and sweet and all but I don’t want to be reminded of oil spills every time I wash my dishes. Why are you messing with my escapism, Dawn?
762 2018-09-27 22:28:07 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
763 2018-09-27 22:28:02 Use L’Oreal Elvive dream length no hair cut cream and coconut oil or hair repair serum at the same time

765 2018-09-27 22:27:58 Trump is right Ted Cruz is not likable
766 2018-09-27 22:27:52 Every time I see Ted Cruz I wonder why no one has drilled for oil in his coiffed hair.
767 2018-09-27 22:27:49 Listening to Cruz...what a goddam SNAKE OIL SALESMAN...
768 2018-09-27 22:27:46 This one that washes in olive oil!! Now he's about to bitch up & cry...& he's the son of #Satan. #TedCruz #KavanaughHearings #Kavanaugh
769 2018-09-27 22:27:44 Get some fennel essential oil, that works great, believe me. And also a humidifier to help clear air 
770 2018-09-27 22:27:40 I HATE the smell of lavender, so, your essential oil witchcraft doesn't work on me

774 2018-09-27 22:27:23 This is an oil painting. This is the Norman Rockwell, 2018 masterpiece.
775 2018-09-27 22:27:21 I mean it’s Dubai I ain’t got oil money to go to that mall
776 2018-09-27 22:27:12 Makes you wonder doesn't it? Why are the GOP throwing themselves under the bus? Why are they risking their careers, and reputation? Why does Trump do this everyday? Something is coming; is it war? Are they scared of Mueller? Are they scared of big oil, or Putin? Why?
777 2018-09-27 22:27:11 can’t wait for my kid start school kids gone be hating off his lunch ima send him with a sandwich lettuce tomato salt pepper vinegar oil , popeyes special , friday’s , amish market

780 2018-09-27 22:27:04 looks like @TedCruz's hair is past due for an oil change. So is the rest of him.
781 2018-09-27 22:27:02 People may believe it is easy to be creative when your product is meant to be fun. How would you make a commodity such as an oil company (which can be quite boring and conflictive) relevant and fun in social media? #foalarssilberbauer @foadominicana

783 2018-09-27 22:26:55 Listen to the 'snake oil' rolling off Ted Cruz's tongue.  He just cannot help himself.
784 2018-09-27 22:26:54 why is Cruz made of pure oil

785 2018-09-27 22:26:42 el problema con el mundo es que los estupidos estan seguros de todo y los inteligentes estan llenos de dudas. bertrand russell.
786 2018-09-27 22:26:34 Coconut oil in general cuz it’s too thick to be absorbed by our skin. Jojoba is a nut (I think) and it’s supposed to be the closest thing to the oils our bodies produce naturally. It rubs in easy and for hair and nails it’ll keep them shiny and strong
787 2018-09-27 22:26:34 Lol jolliof rice that does not have oil or stew is that one jolliof?? 
788 2018-09-27 22:26:32 Eh, Ted. No one cares what you have to say. We've been sold enough snake oil today, thanks.
789 2018-09-27 22:26:06 Got my brother to bring my car for an oil change so I can go shopping with my mom #Priorities
790 2018-09-27 22:26:03 If you look at the new endangered species act. All the 12 people at the hearing are big oil, clearcuting forest, mining, open grazing and other big business. I didn't see a representative from Sierra club. Or other people that have the parks or animals welfare in mind.
791 2018-09-27 22:25:58 SEC on a Witch Hunt, backed by big oil and the auto industry. I'm a gasoline burning gear head, don't own a Tesla, but this is BULL to the SHIT! Makes me want to sell it all and roll in a @Tesla because @elonmusk is a genius, and it's obvious to everyone.
792 2018-09-27 22:25:54 Oil change place be like 20.99 get 2 the counter 63.09 
793 2018-09-27 22:25:53 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
794 2018-09-27 22:25:23 That's exactly what they'll do but i heard the price of oil would have to reach 100+ dollars for this years budget to balance.
795 2018-09-27 22:25:22 Oil change 
796 2018-09-27 22:25:02 And the US government privately applauds that suffering because it helps create unrest it wishes to exploit to advance its goals to gain control of Venezuela's oil. I submit that if Venezuela didn't have large oil reserves the US would have no interest in 'helping'.
797 2018-09-27 22:25:02 Lool..but pls, why did you choose to add palm oil
798 2018-09-27 22:24:57 Hmmm... extra virgin coconut oil clogs the pores? What’s jojoba?
799 2018-09-27 22:24:41 Whenever I see the word red oil I just remember the bf that wakes at night to seek the oil
800 2018-09-27 22:24:38 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

803 2018-09-27 22:24:20 no blow dryers, no straighteners unless you’re fixing a kink, argon oil spray, only shampoo the roots, every OTHER shower, only condition the ends, EVERY shower, and use an Olaplex hair perfector no.3 every week after one of your shampoos

that’s how i’ve gotten mine back 
804 2018-09-27 22:24:17 @ashybooo18 this needs to be made into an oil paining
805 2018-09-27 22:24:13 Yes. Almost everyone who uses that argument assumes oil just magically turns into fuel (gasoline) by itself.
806 2018-09-27 22:24:06 Naudia just told the this guy at the oil change spot she farted.. 
807 2018-09-27 22:23:28 I’m real iffy on coconut oil especially on the face since it clogs pores up, I’ve been using jojoba oil for it and the beard
808 2018-09-27 22:23:16 Saddle soap us a blend of actual soap, neetsfoot oil and beeswax. It softens, conditions and cleans leather. Far better than polish for working on work boots, gun slings, horse tack etc.
809 2018-09-27 22:23:09 I am sleepy asf  I took a nap at school left from there went to get my  oil change and went to sleep there just over it home  depot give me a bed please 
810 2018-09-27 22:23:08 @getintotheweeds I know I tweeted you guys this question earlier but I can't find it anywhere.  So I'll ask again.  What does the term " on the oil " mean?  I posted this question to others here on Instagram and haven't received an answer yet. So someone up there please respond.
811 2018-09-27 22:23:03 Sigh? Then why people still support their plan to hike the oil price? OPEC should come in neutral position to calm down the market.

813 2018-09-27 22:22:54 For years I was that person that spent loads of money on the latest fad in cleansers. This week I decided to try coconut oil to remove makeup and cleanse my face and my skin has never felt better. I feel like a new woman.

825 2018-09-27 22:21:40 Hey @Sean_C_Larkin nice seeing u on @HLNTV with @TVAshleigh tonight. Can’t imagine the pain the family is going through. These pour baby girls being put in oil tanks. Heartbreaking!
826 2018-09-27 22:21:39 Relying on @GOP to not f**k it up, too often feels like rooting for the Washington Generals.
827 2018-09-27 22:21:37 Neutrogena combo skin oil free moisturizer 
828 2018-09-27 22:21:32 Actually I think that SEC should spend more of their time investigating the connection between short sellers and the oil industry. That would probably be more successful
829 2018-09-27 22:21:30 Where does you plant material come from? Who does the extraction? Where are the lab results by batch? How is your oil better? Our 500mg is $35 yours is $69.
830 2018-09-27 22:21:29 I put too much baby oil in my hay and I've just had to rewash it and I'm almost certain it needs doing again but considering I'm up at 6:15 no

835 2018-09-27 22:21:18 I should try that next time. I was lightly frying mine in coconut oil. Hope it's good!
836 2018-09-27 22:21:17 Pedicure done. Oil change done.
837 2018-09-27 22:21:12 Always to his base where people will clap and let him tell them Coal is back so have him go where people can fight back on his lies. Trump was and still is a snake oil salesmen.
838 2018-09-27 22:21:01 I hope they do. I also hope they realize the flimsy standards being used here could be applied to men in their lives as well and are outraged. It's a pathetic deviation from civility and fundamental fairness.
839 2018-09-27 22:20:58 Big Oil freut sich. Elon sollte weniger tweeten und mehr schlafen, ersteres beherzigt er ja offenbar auch schon.
840 2018-09-27 22:20:49 My dad is in the automotive industry :) I know how to change my own oil too (not that I would, but if I were stranded, I could do it)
841 2018-09-27 22:20:47 More coconut oil
842 2018-09-27 22:20:34 although i'm more interested to see if Trump would agree to meet with Meduru/ 
Americans have plans to over through his government to secure their oil infrastructure and mining rigs and might involve paramilitaries in Colombia to counter attack the leftist Venezuelan dictator
843 2018-09-27 22:20:19 Dumb ass check oil price in international market.pti has no lifafa journalist like ur dad.U think if it would have govt faults these lifafas would let it go. Everybody know oil price has increased from $22-$78 in 1 year.Khair tumhara kia qasoor aqal hoti to pmln k supporter hotay

847 2018-09-27 22:19:39 Coconut oil has saved my hair! Mine never would grow and always break off cause I keep it bleach blonde. I put coconut oil all over my hair at night twice a week and sleep with it in my hair then wash it out the next day. I also use stuff called “Miracle Worker” from Sally’s.
848 2018-09-27 22:19:36 REMEMBER GARLAND!!!!  THAT WAS THE DRUM OF CRUDE OIL THAT STARTED THIS FIGHT IN THE U.S. SENATE....
849 2018-09-27 22:19:03 Absolutely, he deserves this. The oil should have offered him that.
850 2018-09-27 22:18:58 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
851 2018-09-27 22:18:54 Now this makes sense why women have used primrose oil to instigate labor--more inflammatory mediators.  It seems "safer" as it is "natural," but it's usually not a good idea to alter a natural process like a birth.
852 2018-09-27 22:18:52 Dang I forgot I need an oil change
853 2018-09-27 22:18:49 Medication saved my life.. when you are driving yourself to ER sometimes twice a week bc you think you are dying.. no meditation, exercise, massage, or oil is gonna help that. And guess what- I got off of it and have been anxiety attack free for years now! You do what u gotta do
854 2018-09-27 22:18:40 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

858 2018-09-27 22:17:51 I kept trimming it like twice a month or so and then I used coconut oil and castor oil mixed and left it on my hair once a week for either one hold night or 3 hours during the day and then washed it out and my hair slowly started repair and get healthy again

882 2018-09-27 22:14:34 Shane, after the referendum the pound dropped against a basket of currencies by 15%, including the dollar, most commodities are priced in dollars, oil for example is 5p a litre more than it should be. A 400 gram  packet of shelled walnuts imported from America is 10% higher.
883 2018-09-27 22:14:23 NIKKI, I watched, I heard TRUMP being LAUGHED at with my OWN 2 EARS! 
Then TRUMP looked at the table where the GERMAN UN were sitting & saw they were laughing, he told them "they were going to HAVE to BUY their OIL from RUSSIA soon! They're our FUCKING ALLIES! WHAT A MORON!

-Mask from Mayo, Super soft avocado and Olive Oil.
-Mask from Yogurt and Eggs.

It can sound kind of weird but that is what we use to do in my country

888 2018-09-27 22:13:46 Way darker money than imagined. This is not illegal drug money crooked.  This is oil, missiles,  weapons and conglamarates that back the Religious Rights crooked. A raped 10-year-old forced to term (Pence's mantra).
Banks and corporations get to pollute airways and grounds. Etc.
889 2018-09-27 22:13:42 No.

These unescorted tankers from Alaska and these Russian tankers are heading to the US. They are not coming to Canada, they are not in the Georgia Straight, not anywhere near Metro Vancouver and have absolutely nothing to do with Canada shipping oil to Asia. Nothing!

899 2018-09-27 22:12:38 And how can oil extraction POSSIBLY be related in any way to that? You obviously need therapy. I hope the 6 percent income to the community from Angus helps with this just cause. All the best.
900 2018-09-27 22:12:35 Like the banksters trying to discredit #bitcoin & the og’s.
So too
The oil oligarchs trying to discredit #ev’s & og’s.
Because they’re both work.

Unfortunately we cant decentralise #ElonMusk but we can back him up.

904 2018-09-27 22:12:10 Are the US sanctions *helping* Venezuela's oil industry? What should a humanitarian country do when it discovers a neighbor country and its people are dealing with economic distress. Should they use that opportunity to advance their own interests at the expense of those people.
905 2018-09-27 22:11:53 @elonmusk the car manufacturers & oil companies are after you, supported by Washington. Move out of the USA; come to #Mexico

909 2018-09-27 22:11:34 i loved having eyelash extensions but i tried everything with oil and all mine ripped out and it was scary so i never did it again 
910 2018-09-27 22:11:21 And yes the pollution thing is a good point but hopefully more electric based rather than oil fuel based vehicles would help with that too
911 2018-09-27 22:11:12 I'd settle for vegan cheese without coconut oil so I don't die 
912 2018-09-27 22:10:59 Born and raised. You have a choice. Unescorted Alaskan/Russian Tankers making other countries profits. Or Social program paying Canadian Oil that comes with new protections, local pilots x 2, attached tugs x 3. Your choice is a testament to how insane this debate has become.
913 2018-09-27 22:10:58 Coconut oil, take hair vitamins and eating healthy! My hair grew faster and stronger when I was at my healthiest 
914 2018-09-27 22:10:48 Lisa scared Dalisia the other day and she “what the fuck” im like come one we going to the alter and pour the whole bottle of blessed oil on you

916 2018-09-27 22:10:41 I understand dude. Just know it will grow back! Lol may take a lil while but take your vitamins and use coconut oil in your hair that helps it grow quicker too
917 2018-09-27 22:10:30 I personally hope that after this joke of an SEC lawsuit is thrown out, Tesla moves it's headquarters, and factories out of the United States. 
Seems to me, this is Big Oil and others fighting him.

921 2018-09-27 22:10:07 If you want to discuss our opposing points of view I can gladly do it but please don't undermine my knowledge about my own country with condescending phrases. 
The oil industry in Venezuela is declining because of several factors that not necessarily include US sanctions.

924 2018-09-27 22:09:39 My cousin was talking shit to me cos I took my car to Toyota to do an oil change instead of doing one myself.... blood you’re 30 years old still working at fast food and you have no car so your opinion is irrelevant to me lmfao

933 2018-09-27 22:08:37 So I was about to grab an 800mg ibuprofen for . cramps which stated today, but I wanted to see if #CBD could do the trick.  I took 1ml of 1500mg sublingual CBD oil at 5:30 and half an hour later my cramps are gone. That's a win.
934 2018-09-27 22:08:32 For me today was a good day to listen to praise music, read my Bible (Psalm 36), remain prayerful, work around the house, get an oil change, cook pizza for dinner, and watch an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Today, my day off needed to have the news off. Resting in Him.
935 2018-09-27 22:08:30 I'm not wrong, am I? I mean, there is no way that these performers are putting adequate sunscreen on their nether regions, especially when I see them getting squirted with water or oil. I would end up in a burn ward if I tried that out.
936 2018-09-27 22:08:26 Ready for the U.S. to walk in and grab the oil. When will people wake up???
937 2018-09-27 22:08:25 Hope the world has learned its lesson. Don't let Nicaragua follow the broken path of Venezuela. Don't want to see "The World is failing to protect Nicaraguans" Or perhaps we don't deserve mention since we do not have oil.
938 2018-09-27 22:08:20 Filthy dirty assumptions! I have been raped FIVE TIMES in my youth. I have lost my North Sea oilman husband to CANCER. You have PROVED to be everything I said of you! You are invested in oil and gas - Your portfolio is guaranteed to fold.
939 2018-09-27 22:08:17 Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine, so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire.
940 2018-09-27 22:07:58 Why do they ruin something good with palm oil, they should be banned from making biscuits.
941 2018-09-27 22:07:49  I’d put peppermint plants in wee pots on the window sills. Dad used to put little jars of peppermint oil mixed with water on the tops of the radiators coz he had awful sinusitis that M n siblings have all inherited. Thanks Granddad.

947 2018-09-27 22:07:21 Your manufacturing industry would say differently on cost vs benefit. Annual US exports to Africa average $22B, and ~$1B to Haiti. Those jobs count for Americans. And it’s not *just* oil, though that’s a big part of it. You fought over in the ME? Glad you made it back, mate.
948 2018-09-27 22:07:16 i, personally, like to use coconut oil to repair my hair
949 2018-09-27 22:07:14 Dont come get your oil changed if you're so fucked up on heroin you can barely walk and cant understand that you cant smoke inside
950 2018-09-27 22:07:09 Yes, the line closures back then were sponsored by the road lobby & oil companies, the rest as they say is history!

961 2018-09-27 22:05:50 If you know, you know. The investment in the Niger delta region, owned by foreigner and the western world alone, is enough to start a country as large as Liberia without touching proceeds from oil. Not to talk of local investors like Dangote and Co. @APCNigeria is a no no there.

965 2018-09-27 22:05:13 Imagine yelling at an old hag who's trying to destroy your life. Wow he's such a bad guy.
966 2018-09-27 22:05:12 Yes, oil and bacteria builds up on your pillowcase from your skin each night so it’s best to wash it or switch it out to prevent bacteria from spreading every time your face touches the pillow again!
967 2018-09-27 22:05:08 Back in the 50's my grandma used this on us. Also warmed sweet oil with a bit of cotton in the ear.

969 2018-09-27 22:05:04 Made a calming spray today. It helps with panic, anxiety, depression, and anger. All you need is some water and some essential oil. For this spray I used 4 drops of lavender and 1 drop of rose.
970 2018-09-27 22:05:04 Oh, there is something going on in the hippocampus for sure that's not average or normal. I just doubt it has anything to do with Brett Kavenaugh
971 2018-09-27 22:04:48 Son, a day wasted. I’m so frustrated—a whole tub of coconut oil spilled on my shorts as I get out of the car. I had to contemplate going to class with oily shorts, and mess up chairs, or go home. I have to slide home son. The worst part about today is this class is once a week 
972 2018-09-27 22:04:37 “letting oil companies not control the methane they let go in the atmosphere-destroying MotherEarth” I’m IN the fracking business (by proxy) & despite Josh Fox’s hype & lie film for gullible idiots which is fully debunked - what does oil have to do with your boogeyman “racism”
973 2018-09-27 22:04:12 I don't know. There's plenty of corruption in the US government, but, big oil and the traditional automakers probably get everything they need through buying senators.
974 2018-09-27 22:04:06 CBD oil manufacturers can, and I think will, explain to consumers (w/ appropriate caveats/disclaimers) why their product is bio-identical to $GWPH's Epidiolex, at a fraction of the price. Less certain is if/how payers can push back on coverage by citing comparative effectiveness.
975 2018-09-27 22:03:58 The country went to slaughter the middle east over a lied oil driven economy. We never have exported oil as an income into the country, it was "exported" to allied countries that needed our help, we often lost money on those exports. We have always, since the 1880's had to import
976 2018-09-27 22:03:57 This has nothing to do with @elonmusk and everything to do with short sellers and the oil and gas industry. Why else would the law suit hope to bar him from being an officer or director of a public company #Tesla. America is a f$&@ing joke in so many ways presently!
977 2018-09-27 22:03:48 I’m glad he did.  She is the reason this crap if going down the way it is.
978 2018-09-27 22:03:32 If the SEC is holding everyone to this standard on social media, this will not be the last fraud case. Oil lobbyists trying to take down any threat to their empire or people on the inside wanting to sell off their Tesla shares. My inner-conspiracist is in full force today.
979 2018-09-27 22:03:31 I’m assuming Tesla? Buy some calls tomorrow 

Don’t worry, I got crushed today too with some of my oil stocks.

991 2018-09-27 22:02:32 That’s right and if they’re not burning our oil they’ll burn someone else’s. Unilaterally ending extraction is madness. We can however cut our own consumption

995 2018-09-27 22:02:10 Please see the U.S. They’ve managed to increase their oil and gas production immensely and reduce their carbon emissions. You don’t need to tax everything in sight. This is just another flavor of the month. Cash grab, plain and simple.

The problem is this: Islam’s inventors (including your grandpa prophet) were robbers. #Quran was written to be used as robbers’ laws.

Today we face #Wahhabism & #Khomeinism as robbers who also sit on a vast oil and gas reserves which make them much more dangerous for humanity.

1031 2018-09-27 21:58:38 think my oil diffuser is broke 
1032 2018-09-27 21:58:30 Olive oil is good replacement for ears for those who can't find or get garlic oil and drinking lukewarm water in the morning is good as well.  A very good message indeed.
1033 2018-09-27 21:58:28 Right. Because invading a country for oil has always worked out for us.

1043 2018-09-27 21:57:18 Well hopefully he will eat some donuts & cut back a bit on the workouts & avoid oil in the future; don’t mind if he stays toned, just not going in the hulk like direction this pic suggests

1047 2018-09-27 21:57:00 Um, no. Venezuela was and is one of the largest exporters of oil to the US. They rake in billions of US dollars.

Also, that website is akin to Pravda. It's credibility is nil.

1050 2018-09-27 21:56:18 They hate peppermint oil. Make a spray up n spritz around entries daily n then once/twice a week. Put 5 drops of peppermint oil, water, little drop dish soap in a small spray bottle n give gentle shake to mix.

1055 2018-09-27 21:55:08 That'll lead to a crack off imo. As it's not a fishing rod perhaps lubricate the ring (light oil, vaseline) for this session and replace the liner afterwards?
1056 2018-09-27 21:54:56 If I had to hypothesize, I would say that the oil cos have finally realized the jig is up. In the next few years reality will be unassailable, so they might as well run the price up as high as possible to max out their profits, then pull the ripcords on their platinum chutes.
1057 2018-09-27 21:54:43 Baby oil doesn’t taste very nice though 
1058 2018-09-27 21:54:36 Price control is an issue on its own,the policy of demand and supply still remains the best bet.
1059 2018-09-27 21:54:32 Lol, that No was glorious
1060 2018-09-27 21:54:29 the USA Dollar is the reason for oil price rise . workers were attacked by you with cuts to lunch breaks and smoko . a sick attack on workers rights. never will National regain trust.

1072 2018-09-27 21:52:36 The 'Maduro Regime' is peak western propaganda.
President @NicolasMaduro came to the his role democratically ,winning 50.6% (7,587,579) of the vote, his opponent 49.1% (7,363,980).

Also Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.
1073 2018-09-27 21:52:24 Did she use the oil and water thing....?

Going to need some fine tuning (aka not burning the peanuts) but definitely happy with the results.

1096 2018-09-27 21:49:49 I have lived near oil rigs every year of my life, because I live in CA. They are everywhere. I lived near them in the Valley, I've lived near them in LA, I've surfed near them in Ventura. They are very dirty, but that only tells a small portion of the pollution they create.
1097 2018-09-27 21:49:39 Lily ate so much fish oil wtf why
1098 2018-09-27 21:49:39 I read that Clove oil is good for pain. I have a nasty toothache & my elbow is still bothering me. I may try that. Seems like that would be pretty safe.

1105 2018-09-27 21:48:55 The United States government doesn't give a damn about the people in your country. The US only sanctions, subverts or attacks countries to advance its OWN interests. The US wants control of Venezuelan oil and to send a message about standing up to it to all S. American countries.
1106 2018-09-27 21:48:41 It remains somewhat of a mystery to me, but I think its investments by oil rich Middle Eastern countries who want to diversify their economy and become a holiday destination.

1139 2018-09-27 21:44:33 If that happens, I suspect that’ll be the least of our problems.

You’ll laugh at me when I continue to have to change the oil and replace worn out parts
1140 2018-09-27 21:44:29 I dunno. Oil has always been about to die, and it never quite seems to happen. If they wanted to diversify then they'd have bought the shale-gas companies instead trying to price-war them in to the ground, as it were.
1141 2018-09-27 21:44:22 Shit, I tagged the wrong company. Yes, the PR industry is completely unregulated. They teach you spin, how to lie, how to twist a story... ect. Just look @Nestle they killed people in Africa, and now they are trying to make their palm oil plantations look sustainable
1142 2018-09-27 21:44:12 We got chestnut oil spray granny bought us from one them betterware type things: we spray it bout the doors too
1143 2018-09-27 21:44:07 Wow... what a dipschitt.. CO2.. or Particulates??

Are you too dense to factor in how Oil/Coal/Gas has enhanced Mankind??  Life Expectancy is at an all-time high in the midst of supposedly deadly CO2.. how is that asshole??

How is that??  Fact is YOUR the Denialist here, not me.

1146 2018-09-27 21:43:38 And why are there so many tyrants and oppressors in Arab countries?
Just who put/keeps these family-owned oil companies in power?
Who kicked Morsi out after elected in Egypt and replaced/funds dictator Sisi?
Hmm.
What a mystery.

1147 2018-09-27 21:43:35 People pray for cake.... but when the almighty give them egg, oil, butter, batter, pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen

1150 2018-09-27 21:43:12 Looks really good! So what I'm getting from this is its really a small convection oven, you coat food with a little oil and the hot air heats everything up and "fries" the food. Kind of like my big convection oven I had at my restaurant. I might have to buy one! Thanks!
1151 2018-09-27 21:43:05 There's a problem if you think it is okay to tax each barrel of oil $10 when the production costs are, as you quote, around $13. The tax would be 77 percent of the total cost of oil production per barrel. That's just plum crazy!
1152 2018-09-27 21:42:56 When we say govt we don't refer to an individual, but an individual has the say,he's elected to make decisions work to better the lives of the citizen.

1159 2018-09-27 21:42:27 7yr old me and my siblings cooking Ogbono without oil. Just blended it and put it in a pot of water  we knew something was wrong but couldn't place it.
1160 2018-09-27 21:42:23 JFC, Slim. Giant oil corps the world over, including Exxon and Shell decades ago, acknowledge the facts of climate change caused by CO2. Get yer head out of your a-- already! Who do you think your foolishness is going to help?
1161 2018-09-27 21:42:22 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1162 2018-09-27 21:42:21 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1163 2018-09-27 21:42:10 Lmao,niggasaid 16 years of abundant prosperity, like Abacha left us with a great economy or oil wasn't at a $20 a barrel low...

1171 2018-09-27 21:41:36 That and also oil being bartered for the greenback. (What I call a "green economy" :))

1176 2018-09-27 21:40:39 Spending half of my birthday money on oil for my damn car is one of many reasons why I’m not really looking forward to my birthday

1180 2018-09-27 21:40:15 I’m getting an oil change and I’m pretty sure I heard the guy say there’s no oil in my car lol I’m not surprised I kept forgetting to get this done

co wash your hair and deep condition once or twice a week with winter coming up. oil your ends with castor or a thick oil. your ends need the most love especially in the winter.
1186 2018-09-27 21:39:50 Gave my hair a peppermint oil treatment 
1187 2018-09-27 21:39:19 Don’t forget that the people who are enforcing penalties over a silly tweet are part of the system that levy our taxes, prints fiat currency, subsidizes oil, allows monsanto to poison our food, locks ppl up for weed and buys puts at technical levels! Save humanity $TSLA !
1188 2018-09-27 21:39:17 omg I looooove roasted beets, they're especially good when you bake them drizzled with salt, pepper and olive oil :D
1189 2018-09-27 21:39:13 Can someone explain why our growth keeps declining despite an increase in crude oil revenues?
1190 2018-09-27 21:38:52 Have a North Sea Oil for me. 
1191 2018-09-27 21:38:52 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts avocado oil with 1 part orange juice and 1 part tomato paste. Add rosemary and jaggery to taste.
1192 2018-09-27 21:38:49 He is a shocking person. He is disrespectful, repugnant, self entitled, lacks self awareness and no respect for women. He has not yet interrupted a man the way he has a woman on committee. He clearly is painting his character on full view ..it is no oil painting. #StopKavanuagh
1193 2018-09-27 21:38:46 All fruits and vegetables are halal unless prepared with a non halal item. So chips chopped up and fried in veg oil as is the norm would be halal. You've no fucking clue have you.
1194 2018-09-27 21:38:43 It's great! The taste is superior to other mainstream nut milks. It actually tastes more nutty rather than bland because we don't use gums to thicken it yet it remains thick because of the coconut oil and it gets a nice slightly sweet taste from the glycerin or dates.
1195 2018-09-27 21:38:40 E eu aqui olhando para cara do Temer no encerramento da Rio Oil & Gas
1196 2018-09-27 21:38:37 It's with Margarine, that's oil, right? I only started baking this year and don't even do it a lot, I've got a lot left to learn.
1197 2018-09-27 21:38:34 Read the stupid chart header my friend.  It says "Mining:  Oil and Gas EXTRACTION".  you should educate yourself about the industry before trying to destroy it and put thousand of people out of work because of your extremist environmental ideology.

1203 2018-09-27 21:37:58 I am looking a good rotation job in any of the oil and gas industry. I was worked in Iraq Basra British Petroleum by Petrofac co as a E&I Manager and last project is Saudi Aramco/Saipem co as a E&I Superintendent in 20_23 PI Gas well head platform.
1204 2018-09-27 21:37:49 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
1205 2018-09-27 21:37:47 At least u get the oil changed. I know folks who ain’t even do that and wonder why the car suddenly shut off 
1206 2018-09-27 21:37:47 Never buy a used book from Amazon. I got one that smells like rancid cooking oil, and my dog won't stop licking it. I think the dog's gonna eat my homework for real
1207 2018-09-27 21:37:44 So @Walmart in cross lanes changed my oil and didn’t put the oil filter on correctly and now my car’s engine is destroyed I have no way to work and no way to school and nobody would speak to me when I got there

1211 2018-09-27 21:37:35 Tonight’s league should be interesting as we are bowling on the only pair that is being currently bowled on by the local high school. Heading to the lanes now to see what will be left of oil if we have some high rev 2 ganders with reactive balls eating it up. #Bowling
1212 2018-09-27 21:37:35 And yes, outside of war, America spends tons of money on the supranational order, but not out of charity. It’s because it secures your country’s business and political interests around the world. It keeps your stock market climbing and oil prices stable.
1213 2018-09-27 21:37:28 We don't - and never will, on ecological grounds - use oil or natural gas in our house, coal is also a no-no, and there are those who would ban our wood burning stove. We cannot afford solar panels. Wind power is evil on aesthetic grounds. How are we to power and light our home?
1214 2018-09-27 21:37:13 Wen got hoagie oil in the brib thts like 4 T’d sandwich was jus doin numbers

1221 2018-09-27 21:36:21 For dinner we had sauteed pork chops in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, green beans, and my daughter had fries as well. She can have gluten, mommy can't. #Keto doesn't have to be fancy, and most of the time it's not.
1222 2018-09-27 21:36:16 I met Elon a spell back. Smart guy. IMHO he may have his head in his ego-based Arse too often. I wish he would put his cousin more in chg of the solar city gig so I coulf solar/rapid juice my 2011 T-Roadster off the oil shale grid....jus' sayin :)

1227 2018-09-27 21:36:02 I mean it potentially can be. you may have to use a little cornstarch in the milk to get the desired thickness but you can certainly make a roux out of olive oil or coconut
1228 2018-09-27 21:35:32 Yeah I was in the olive oil business with his father!
1229 2018-09-27 21:35:18 What are folks experience's with CBD oil would you use it for anxiety? for anti inflammatory purposes? or otherwise? @ me
1230 2018-09-27 21:35:11 The average wait for toxicology results is like 2 months in Colorado and it's even affecting cases like the nutball oil well family strangler because they can't finalize the autopsy without tox results. Why is that? @Singer4Colorado @RepMikeFoote #coleg

1243 2018-09-27 21:34:03 Wouldn't be so sure. I love Elon and my Model 3, but this administration is anti-clean energy and is in oil industry's pockets. Maybe they'll not want to go after most-made-in-USA car company, but I doubt it.

1281 2018-09-27 21:29:38 I have had an absolute crap day. I gotta plan to fix it though, going home soon, gonna make a Super Nacho Pizza, relax and watch the Oil. Probably have to stop and get a bottle of malbec to wash it down.
1282 2018-09-27 21:29:30 There's hemp oil that has a high THC. So yes you can but they sell special vape mods for those
1283 2018-09-27 21:29:22 Data error was a direct function of methodological changes China introduced back when it was worried that its surplus was soaring (on fall in oil price and weak demand) ...   

would be interesting (or at least amusing to me) if they reversed to avoid reporting a deficit ...
1284 2018-09-27 21:29:14 @dan_payne31 - we have all been there haven't we. A year end audit, exams before Christmas. 
Do I want to be a cleaner on an oil rig in Scotland? Absolutely
Classic stuff
1285 2018-09-27 21:29:12 Need to sideline this prosecutor, pay her and send her on her way.
Unleash the hounds and let remaining R's have their say.
1286 2018-09-27 21:29:12 i was taking a hot bath (with bath salts and rose oil) and i guess i fell asleep for a few minutes bc when i got up my belly button just fell off and now i dont have anything there...
1287 2018-09-27 21:29:08 thats due to their oil wealth in the north sea
1288 2018-09-27 21:29:06 We need a #labour socialist government like a whole in the head just look at #Venezuela an oil rich country run by a socialist government just like what that dictator #jeremycorby wants this country to be like.  We could all have 20 p a day from the bank
1289 2018-09-27 21:29:03 Mostly yes, but add lard, vegetable oil and sugar.
1290 2018-09-27 21:29:01 Halved, stuffed cheese, chorizo, onion & olive oil.
Bake for about an hour. 
1291 2018-09-27 21:28:56 お前の望んだディストピアやぞ
1292 2018-09-27 21:28:48 So fickle Paul! You need to oil wrestle her at pippas event then!
1293 2018-09-27 21:28:48 いってきます
1294 2018-09-27 21:28:45 Corrugated cardboard, pressboard, metal cans, plastics numbers one through seven, newspapers, magazines, shredded white paper, cooking oil, Chipboard, aluminum foil, etc.
1295 2018-09-27 21:28:40 @traderxyz !?  Lol. Onyx have snake oil too?
1296 2018-09-27 21:28:13 Russian money in his bank accounts. He has to show Putin he is fighting to help trump stay in office with kavanaugh's protection on the supreme Court. Simple as that. Russian money, Syrian connections, Graham's going down it's going to come out. Houston oil co money in his bank!!
1297 2018-09-27 21:28:10 JERKS!! LEAVE THOSE HORSES ALONE!!! Put your oil, natural gas, and water wells up. The horses, aren't harming you.
1298 2018-09-27 21:28:06 Ameen
1299 2018-09-27 21:27:53 One Emptied 4ltr Red Oil that she cooking Egusi , this happened 3/4yrz back till date she's still apologising...
1300 2018-09-27 21:27:48 If i go to Santorini, I will definitely carry red oil in my pocket. Just because
1301 2018-09-27 21:27:10 is Grandnut oil
1302 2018-09-27 21:27:09 Distributing expired oil and unwholesome food to flood victims.
I weep for you, you are a learnt person. You don't deserve this disgrace from npp
1303 2018-09-27 21:27:05 Sure, but I don’t think you spend a billion dollars looking for oil and then walk because paperwork. Shell would have known that going in
1304 2018-09-27 21:26:52 I think you are assuming they have an IQ greater than their shoe size. Not everyone is as intelligent as you Kira, especially those who exceed in life, using their snake oil sales abilities.
1305 2018-09-27 21:26:46 LMFAO why this man just tell me $89 for a mf oil change pls gtf out my face
1306 2018-09-27 21:26:44 They'll come for us up here before long.

Or rather, the oil/forestry/mineral/arable land/fresh water resources up here.
1307 2018-09-27 21:26:36 Got rid of sugar, rice, wheat and oil. 100%. Try to develop taste for all things sugar free, may use brown sugar ocassionally. Brown rice, brown bread and Olive oil are alternatives. BF: 2 Eggs omlette s'wich with skimmed milk tea. LH: Chicken mince with brown rice. DN: BarBQ 1/3
1308 2018-09-27 21:26:21 No grasp on reality, that's why. I'm no Notley fan, but credit to her in that she realizes you don't flip a switch and turn off oil. Demand for oil is higher than ever and increasing 1.5MM bbl per year. We have better regs than most, so let's sell our oil and reap the benefits.
1309 2018-09-27 21:26:19 No oxygen and grabbing at others. Making fools of themselves. Compromising their own credibility.
1310 2018-09-27 21:26:15 Wrong: this just isn't the way. If we shut it down, just as much oil will be produced and used in the world. need a different mechanism. doing it here just means less wealth here and harder to make changes
1311 2018-09-27 21:26:14 Look like a car mechanic ihnight ask me to check ur oil dares a dare no clue soz can someone check mine? X
1312 2018-09-27 21:26:13 WOW SO COOL THAT SOMEONE STOLE A CHECK FROM MY BOYFRIENDS JEEP WHILE WE WERE GETTING THE OIL CHANGED YESTERDAY AND CASHED IT TODAY .
1313 2018-09-27 21:25:58 Unfortunately the champions of Human Rights are more concerned with the cheap supply of oil then the 62K Yamini lives slaughtered by evil Saudis with their help.
1314 2018-09-27 21:25:53 Bought @iflixZW weekly bundle, mainly 2 watch cnn, spend the whole day couldn't access it.. No response from @iflixZW.. Zvakaoma.. Snake oil salesmanship chaiyo!!
1315 2018-09-27 21:25:48 @SU2C How to end cancer .let me think ,gcmaf .cannibas oil with THC. Turmeric .Baking soda. Doctor byrzinski. Rick simpson.Charlotte gerson. Doctor Gersons daughter . Lets kick Cancer into touch .Oh sorry are we not allowed to prove cancer can be cured no chemo.
1316 2018-09-27 21:25:43 I would say all of my job interviews I've ever had have gone better than Brett Kavanaugh's, including when i interviewed for the Costco oil change department and admitted I had no relevant skills, no experience, and very little interest in the type of work.
1317 2018-09-27 21:25:26 I'm 37 and I've spent the last 6 month alternating between Extra Virgin Oil Olive and Bio Oil as my moisturiser and now look 12. Been constantly compliment my skin. You're welcome.
1318 2018-09-27 21:25:26 Incorporating argan oil into my skin routine has made me feel so glowy
1319 2018-09-27 21:25:19 And the chart only accounts for oil and gas extraction.  That upstream production. It doesn't account for midstream (pipelines and transport) and downstream (refining and products) .  It's erroneously skewed data.  It doesn't acct for ppl employed in company owned stations, etc.
1320 2018-09-27 21:25:14 I am praying  for Brett s. And his family. He will  be the new supreme court judge.  There are still good people. Just as oil rises on water, his innocence will prevail. Dr Ford  needs a Dr. She is SICK!!! Please don't let Feinstein and Rosenthal make Jews look bad. I am Jewish
1321 2018-09-27 21:24:58 Work and friendship
Water and oil
1322 2018-09-27 21:24:55 No wait I fell out when you was in the house looking all oil down. I’m like damn what oil is that?  It was you sweating with no ac.  I was like . Great episode 
1323 2018-09-27 21:24:42 Yasjay Dawisu is layman in this regard...just tell him in simple terms. We may not afford cement roads simply because they are more expensive.

1326 2018-09-27 21:24:26 is it true the cbd oil keep cancer away?
1327 2018-09-27 21:24:23 They should all develop their potentials and grow their IGRs and stop depending on Abuja alert alone, that's why we need sound people at the helms of affairs.
You can't keep suffering people because of political decisions else a revolution is imminent.
1328 2018-09-27 21:24:20 Lindsey Graham is Dramatics via selling out the country 2 Big Oil selling South Carolina coastline trying to stop the Mueller investigation with Trump by this nominee Lindsey Graham is a hoax in America is watching you you belong in that circle with Rand Paul traitor of America
1329 2018-09-27 21:23:59 I lost my favorite lip oil / gloss my life has not been the same 
1330 2018-09-27 21:23:57 Yes. We do. The reason we haven't moved forward is because natural gas, oil, and coal companies are so deeply tied to government (Trump has several in his cabinet) that using this tech is expensive and difficult on purpose without need be.
1331 2018-09-27 21:23:51 Did you forget the Energy losses for production, transmission of Crude Oil & the refineries & finally the transportation? If you just factor in the amount of electricity used by oil refineries, that alone will show the relative efficiency of #EV. Roof top #Solar is already here.
1332 2018-09-27 21:23:51 Oil prices are on the rise, just a heads up
1333 2018-09-27 21:23:31 We have always been a poor country, we think we are rich because we pump small oil
1334 2018-09-27 21:23:27 You are a clown. Okowa's community has a large deposit of oil and gas. 

You don't know anything. 

It is has* not have you faceless moron.
1335 2018-09-27 21:23:26 @Ritzcrackers Today, @Greenpeace activists are occupyed  Wilmar's palm oil refinery  Indonesia. They're sending a message to the makers of products like Colgate, Dove and Ritz Crackers - stop buying palm oil from companies destroying rainforests. @SaveTheRainFor @climatecalamity

1337 2018-09-27 21:23:09 biggest lie the skin industry tells u is that u need to take away oil from ur face 2 make it less oily. U need oil for oily skin to stop ur skin from over-producing... if u take oil away it will over-produce oil like crazy!!  #TipFromDaughterOfASkincareSpecialist #NewCher
1338 2018-09-27 21:23:05 check you oil. stay hydrated. make sure you take a break. eat something.
1339 2018-09-27 21:23:00 Proof these hideous creatures have no empathy at all. Absolute power is what motivates them. They are incapable of feeling embarrassment or shame and are void of self respect or dignity.
1340 2018-09-27 21:22:46 Man you seem so much worried . What about those whom you take oil from 
1341 2018-09-27 21:22:40 Last time I used oil paint it got on my socks and was all over the house
1342 2018-09-27 21:22:36 Oratane really does make my skin super Dry. I just applied tissue oil now and I literally can hardly feel it.
1343 2018-09-27 21:22:36 Don't wear a shirt and bring baby oil. Mel won't be happy otherwise. 
1344 2018-09-27 21:22:36 The fact all I need in the morning is oil and a pik most days for my hair is lovely as hell!
1345 2018-09-27 21:22:32 Found a regular #2 HB pencil to draw with!

Jesus christ how did I ever used to sketch with these? Its like using a 3" paintbrush dipped in used motor oil
1346 2018-09-27 21:22:19 My wife threw a bottle of Omega 3 capsules at me. 
It's OK though, I only have super fish oil injuries.
1347 2018-09-27 21:22:07 Propaganda war? But how is that going to help us with the oil you are saying it’s over?
1348 2018-09-27 21:21:57 Watching @itvnews at Ten on the state of Venezuela - food queues, hyper-inflation, power shortages, disease outbreaks, soaring crime and squandered oil resources. Remember, this is the socialist paradise much lauded by Corbyn.
1349 2018-09-27 21:21:51 This exfoliator & oil I just bought is giving me sooo much life 
1350 2018-09-27 21:21:47 Ford,GM,Oil corporation will do anything to stop this revolution.

1355 2018-09-27 21:21:09 (you'd need to make a vegan bechamel, make sure to steep a lot of aromatics (onion, carrot, bay, peppercorns, garlic, etc) in your UNSWEETENED soy, oat or almond milk, and combine olive oil and flour in a 2:3 ratio in a pan, gently add in the milk and stir until very thick
1356 2018-09-27 21:21:01 Lmao cleaned my car out put air in my tires and got my oil changed , i feel accomplished 
1357 2018-09-27 21:20:41 Avocado is excellent for your hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Eat well. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to controls hair loss. or analogous. I can't seem to discover the right web site. Worth the effort. Many benefits.
1358 2018-09-27 21:20:32 Oil u mean
1359 2018-09-27 21:20:17 @Greenpeace piss off.

1360 2018-09-27 21:20:08 @nationalpost @JustinTrudeau Why don't we just stop shipping all the oil the U.S imports from us to them if they want to dance? I'm certain China and other emerging markets would take the barrels...
1361 2018-09-27 21:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1362 2018-09-27 21:19:51 Looking for a subsitute for eggs in Yorkshire puddings (I have settled on just veg oil and a bit of baking powder) First results I click on:

1367 2018-09-27 21:19:40 I’m in a Uber rn and I don’t think this lady knows I did her oil change a few months ago haha
1368 2018-09-27 21:19:27 Oil companies.   Trump peeps.
1369 2018-09-27 21:19:07 I had to stop watching Chris was articulate, science based ref’ing studies & their limitation.  Joel made random statements w/no evidence & his poor knowledge of cholesterol & fat was astonishing. When talking about meat they did not acknowledge the bread & veg oil meat was into
1370 2018-09-27 21:19:06 Getting ready for winter. 2 installations/replacement of oil fired hot water boilers with indirect hot water heaters.

1375 2018-09-27 21:18:27 Dang lighten up
1376 2018-09-27 21:18:21 Oh we are pretty smart in BC. We know how to develop the oil sands in-situ with supercritical carbon dioxide and upgrade and refine it at the same time.
1377 2018-09-27 21:18:20 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for mindfulness, and put some plumeria essential oil in my diffuser.
1378 2018-09-27 21:18:19 What planet are you on? The ONLY people who are still supporting the GOP and Trump are the very dull bulbs who shift with the wind, big oil/dark money, and the invested. That is not even close to majority,
1379 2018-09-27 21:18:11 Yes, it’s important to exfoliate to remove dead skin that prevents absorbing moisture. Also consider using a stronger humectant, like a lip oil, or a lip night cream.
1380 2018-09-27 21:18:10 Ah, but at least it doesn’t contain palm oil like Clover. It’s just butter softened with rapeseed oil.
1381 2018-09-27 21:18:05 Since they #DemSenators do not delight in righteousness & choose 2 invoke wickness over #JudgeKavanaugh’s integrity  their own words shall judge them.

1384 2018-09-27 21:17:43 You people should stop talking recklessly, those that can't pay workers,were they unable to pay themselves? Look its a crime against humanity to have 18k as minimum wage in 2018 with the upsurge in life style, we're sitting on a gunpowder which might explode sooner or later.
1385 2018-09-27 21:17:26 Oil lobby influence us is becoming like Russia now
1386 2018-09-27 21:17:15 reminder to self: order more CBD oil.
1387 2018-09-27 21:17:09 It runs very smooth, except for Hertz rental car program. We need better access to oil changes than pepboys offers. We need something fast like jiffy lube, so we can be driving
1388 2018-09-27 21:17:02 The only thing these guys are missing is the massage oil to rub all over him...
1389 2018-09-27 21:16:53 Honey glazed turkey, Muenster cheese, oil, pepper, salt, vinegar. 

I wish I was back in Brooklyn. 
1390 2018-09-27 21:16:52 It was as great! But now I’m coved in eucalyptus oil and smell like something a koala would attack.
1391 2018-09-27 21:16:47 Yessssssway too much oil 
1392 2018-09-27 21:16:41 @wheato898 by the sounds of things the Canadian crop & shipping costs are working against us. Local pressers are running a business so they may look to other markets, oil may also be an issue for me. Lot of unknowns & I am not in Hay my livestock are so that is driving decisions
1393 2018-09-27 21:16:39 I understand love! I definitely reccomend using less oil than I did in my video then, I went from washing my hair twice a week to once, because it's so much more hydrated. Let me know the results if you do try it 
1394 2018-09-27 21:16:24 I added honey too.. ran out of olive oil 
1395 2018-09-27 21:16:20 If the government finds diamonds or oil in your backward, it’s government property.but if they find drugs, it’s yours.
1396 2018-09-27 21:15:57 Correct !

“You’re kidding right?”
“Yeah, it says keep out”
lmaooo what did jimmy make me watch
1402 2018-09-27 21:15:16 That’s ok, we have plenty of oil here too.
1403 2018-09-27 21:15:08 Before seeing a burning building, I rush past it all and observe an oil rig twist behind me
1404 2018-09-27 21:14:50 he believes his womb to be their oil softer than your cane streaming inside your curve
1405 2018-09-27 21:14:37 Sun block during the day (prevent scars from darkening) and tissue oil (i use Celltone tissue oil) at night before you go sleep. It worked wonders for me!
1406 2018-09-27 21:14:36 You just can't compete with OIL now
1407 2018-09-27 21:14:17 Duh by not using the oil and gas that we find. Obviously this will not happen immediately. Or even in our lifetimes.  But sometimes we need to think of others instead of ourselves.

1413 2018-09-27 21:13:41 That guy that looks like he rubs groundnut oil on his head shey?
1414 2018-09-27 21:13:06 I don’t consider them to be ethical in the least.

The SEC did nothing to prevent the recession, caused by wreckless speculation, big oil, and the federalization of GM.

They are among the lowest ranking American government agencies by the Center for Effective Government.
1415 2018-09-27 21:12:59 Use vitamin E oil , it’s $12-$20
1416 2018-09-27 21:12:49 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1417 2018-09-27 21:12:41 Woke up a sad sack of shit but childhood momentous and a little positivity spread to others has turned me into something happier.

1423 2018-09-27 21:12:12 counterpoint: they would love having a way to hedge against the death of oil, which is inevitable unless human society completely collapses, and also pitch saudi arabia as a modern progressive society that is a good place to do business

1433 2018-09-27 21:11:19 The sheer amount of oil there I think hand slippage is a sure thing.

1435 2018-09-27 21:11:18 US loves Saudi Arabia bc of oil. Even after 15 out of 19 hijackers on 9/11 were found to be Saudi. Instead they attacked Iraq and put racist Muslim bans on literally every other country. W even flew out the Saudis after it happened. And they ignore their human rights record.
1436 2018-09-27 21:11:16 Despite having the largest proven oil reserves on earth, Venezuela is running out of petroleum fuel. That's Socialism at work. People have to wait up to 3 days in cues just to fill up their tanks.

1468 2018-09-27 21:06:31 Exploration won't re-start until the incentive to do so is no brainer. That might not be until late 2019. The meantime the Price of Oil Juniors is at all-time discount to NAV in some cases. Cycle low is time to buy.

1487 2018-09-27 21:03:18 Really any valuation of environmental impacts would be good. But considering that the oil & gas industries received more in subsidies just for exploration and development expense (7.1bn) than the entire NSF (6.8bn), simply stopping the subsidy is a big tax.
1488 2018-09-27 21:03:06 I've been using "Oil Spill" as shorthand for an utter lack of subtlety.
1489 2018-09-27 21:02:55 At least the oil makes one wonder about his adventures in ancient Greece (and who will write about that...)

1534 2018-09-27 20:57:37 I am a decades-long environmentalist who has never liked the coal industry blowing up mountains to get at coal more easily etc.  I frequently argue w/my oil industry sibling about things like fracking. There must be a balance of protecting environment & obtaining energy.

1558 2018-09-27 20:54:15 People don't want very much near them, thats normal. It doesn't matter for the global oil and gas sector as those same people continue to rely on FFs every day & nothing in the data suggests they won't for at least a few more decades, fracking, or no UK fracking. Doesn't matter.

1562 2018-09-27 20:53:21 no problem! maybe rub some peppermint on your stomach too, mix it with a bit of coconut oil if you have some so it’s not so strong. but I feel you girl, it’s the worst
1563 2018-09-27 20:53:08 Any other use of parsnips is a waste imo. Maple syrup, touch of olive oil, salt. YUM.

1566 2018-09-27 20:52:35 What about the families who have to live along busy roads, we do , we live along the A3 we didnt have a choice in the matter, social housing puts you anywhere. We have to wipe black oil from our windows and window sills everyday, How can this be good for our health?

America looks like a joke with all these old man used car salesman selling snake oil on the side.
1585 2018-09-27 20:50:09 Could not agree more - Tesla heavy-lifted the car industry and shunted it 20 years into the future. Incumbents have to follow, hence the wave of EVs to come. The adjacent oil fuel industry is the one disrupted - US gasoline sales flat since 2016 ..

1597 2018-09-27 20:48:53 anyone know the best way to get tan off without waiting for it to fade?

i usually get it off by soaking in a hot bath with baby oil in for about 10-15 mins then exfoliate, however i still have to wait for it to fade before i can do this and it’s so annoying being pale and patchy

1675 2018-09-27 20:36:53 You're pulling things out of your ass. I already broke it down in this thread: The $13 figure includes stripper wells, not just fracking. The break even for fracked oil is ~ $60 including fixed profit increase + exploration. Without that just fracking breaks even at around $25.
1676 2018-09-27 20:36:49 Read that report for how they define a subsidy.

They decide what the royalty should be on oil sands then because the actual royalty is less it is ipso facto a subsidy. Same with tax depreciation. 
 
Actual subsidies where money flows from gov't to corps is what I'm discussing.

1692 2018-09-27 20:34:33 Okay! I made the harvest spice soaps and the apple cider sugar scrubs. I need to package them later but for now they are setting. I will be sure to put this in the listing, but the scrubs have almond oil in it. So if you have a nut allergy, be aware!

1695 2018-09-27 20:34:25 And your party revoked the Iran deal sanction their oil sales driving the price higher than that And now all Texan are paying higher prices for your failed policies
1696 2018-09-27 20:34:22 Ignoring the subsidies, tax breaks, and taxpayer expenses for the environmental damage and foreign occupations profitable oil requires, your argument is that we’d be better off without the Internet, railroads, and highways because they cost the taxpayers money?

1699 2018-09-27 20:34:07 Nooooo! That sucks. I hope you can get it off with some type of oil (baby, coconut, etc). If not, that'll be an awesome trip to the store.

1704 2018-09-27 20:33:29 We’re buying oil from Saudi Arabia. Trump deals with Saudi Arabia. Yet, the majority of the terrorists on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. I tried to overthrow Iran’s government and you say the rise of Islamic rule there.  Iran didn’t bomb us. Saudia Arabia did.
1705 2018-09-27 20:33:26 Oil is at over $80 get ready for gas prices to spike

My logic button says if I could buy Canadian oil at a $30/bbl discount why would I bother refining it when I could load it on a ship in the gulf coast and make $15US/bbl after paying Warren Buffet $5/bbl to rail it to the coast. It is all a US controlled scam!
1721 2018-09-27 20:31:15 Good on you! Hope you missed out on the oil drum crap as well.

1736 2018-09-27 20:29:43 There were research grants in the 1960's. 

The Federal Gov't bought 15% of Syncrude in the 1970's over $100 million. 

The NEP had big grants as part of nationalizing the industry. 

Largely oil & gas subsidies have been to consumers in third world countries.

1740 2018-09-27 20:29:14 I asked around & the Flat Earthers claim the top of the world is flat but the bottom is deep. I had asked them why when we don’t end up on the other side whe oil people dig 15,000 feet below.
1741 2018-09-27 20:29:10 While I see where you’re coming from, restaurants can’t 100% guarantee meal safety.
I’m extremely allergic to shellfish, and anytime I order any form of fried food at a place that sells fried shellfish, I break out sometimes because they use the same oil for all fried foods.
1742 2018-09-27 20:28:56 I think it’s time for an oil change but I’m too lazy for that shit

It could be fraud. It could be an attack. We’ll see.

1760 2018-09-27 20:26:06 It depends on what oil/brand you ingested. What I mean by this is many essential oils are adulterated with synthetic fragrance which can be harmful if ingested! There are also some oils that should not be ingested at all! It is always best to speak to a doctor if you feel sick!:)
1761 2018-09-27 20:26:05 Have you tried CBD oil, really cleared up sciatic pain and back pain for me
1762 2018-09-27 20:26:02 Do you need more oil?
1763 2018-09-27 20:25:59 when Saudi Arabia pumps its final barrel of oil we will see truth and vengence for that day
1764 2018-09-27 20:25:58 Remember four years ago when the told us it was running out.  They also did a deal with the Saudi's to produce more oil thereby reducing the price.  This falsely meant north Sea oil became less profitable.  Funny how suddenly all these finds are popping up

1771 2018-09-27 20:25:15 Cancelling further exploration does not impact the use of existing permits which enable drilling to take place for another 30 years. So 'destroying' the energy sector is being overly dramatic. It's putting a limit only on the oil & gas sector whilst planning for change.

1828 2018-09-27 20:18:10 I know, the price of a gallon of oil these days, cheaper to buy a new engine.
1829 2018-09-27 20:18:08 I suggest tronscript! Also pls avoid registry cleaners because they're the equivalent to snake oil >:c
1830 2018-09-27 20:17:58 Line 9 was reversed after 2012. 

Today more than 50% of oil and gas comes courtesy of Trump which one would think all Canadians could agree makes no sense. 

300,000 bbls/d from line 9 includes oil from Sask, AB and North Dakota.
1831 2018-09-27 20:17:54 Was frying fish, wanted to add more vegetable oil but ended up adding kerosene instead

1834 2018-09-27 20:17:42 Profit on oil still isn’t nearly that high. Profit on a gallon of gas after all expenses is just a couple cents per gallon, while the government currently taxes 38 cents in Texas.  Try harder.

1837 2018-09-27 20:17:23 Child please. How many billions have we spent on subsidies for the oil industry?
1838 2018-09-27 20:17:23 Pssstt... sourcing EVOO from farmers all around the world (and boys named Ryan!) allows for fresh oil with a consistent, delicious taste year-round. Because we’re both committed to the finest quality, you know we belong together!
1839 2018-09-27 20:17:21 And gas and oil rights in the Golan Heights...

1850 2018-09-27 20:16:16 okay first wash your face with a normal pure soap, and then you gotta mix a few drops of tree tea oil with bio oil (or any tissue oil) and apply morning and evening-be consistent and dischem is your plug

1865 2018-09-27 20:15:14 A oil find , putting away for rainy day , weeks, months and decades ! Westminster, spends it on bailing out the wealthy and illegal wars were young people die on all sides !
1866 2018-09-27 20:15:09 Our little kitty came home covered in engine oil. Did all I could for her. Hope she'll get through this in one piece.
1867 2018-09-27 20:15:03 Also, no palm oil allowed.
1868 2018-09-27 20:14:49 Good CBD oil contains little to no THC! It wont make you feel high or anything! Tinctures are simply putting one drop under your tongue and letting it absorb! Then it will help you feel relaxed, less anxious, and just let you go about your day :)
1869 2018-09-27 20:14:39 What is traditional rice pilaf?

1879 2018-09-27 20:13:37 Everyone should watch, Shadow war in the Sahara documentary on @AJEnglish 
The Sahel Region rich in gas, coltan, oil, gold, copper, salt, ivory, diamonds, and more is new front for multinational military interventions.

1887 2018-09-27 20:13:02 A girl had her bag stolen today at oil mill, it wasn't even dark.
She was strong to not even cry much, me I know how I felt when my phone was taken.
People in the taxi were just narrating their own experiences, makes me wonder if Rivers state is even good to raise my kids in
1888 2018-09-27 20:13:01 Oil is used to make plastic. Credit cards are made of plastic, so you need oil to shop! How about that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
1889 2018-09-27 20:12:52 Instead of working, I deep conditioned my hair, did an avocado face mask followed up with moisturizer+marula oil.

1899 2018-09-27 20:11:17 Did they mention their diabolical deal for Iranian Oil?
The effect the EU`s betrayal of the Iranian People will fall on the Iranian Peoples?
Is the Labour Party going to be complicit in oppressive violent regime actions?
1900 2018-09-27 20:11:08 Y’all pray I can start the oil field sooner 
1901 2018-09-27 20:11:08 Creo que ‘oil of every pearl’s un-insides’ sí es mi disco fav del año y va a ser muy difícil que alguien lo desbanque en lo que resta del año

1913 2018-09-27 20:10:14 US Shale Oil & Saudi Arabia's Oil is a cartel making lots of money after @realDonaldTrump made a deal with KSA during his visit there. Incidentally, Russia too has benefited from this alliance.  Coffers of terror sponsors are full too. The only losers are India & China.

1932 2018-09-27 20:07:52 Good work. Now get on with the business of running Canada and getting us fair market value for our oil by building more pipelines to our coasts.
1933 2018-09-27 20:07:40 Outdoor in Canada is all about the variety planted, and the ability to dry and process into oil.

I've got the seed variety -who wants to partner?

1936 2018-09-27 20:06:50 For a cheaper, quicker pastry, #veganrecipehour 1cup s/r flour, little salt, 1/3cup water, splash o/oil. Mix, knead briefly, roll out 2/3rds & place on baking paper. Lower into pie dish and fill. Use other 3rd for a top crust. Sub sugar for salt for fruit pie. Bake immediately.
1937 2018-09-27 20:06:43 Midland Texas is now home to 22% of the world's oil rigs, in the midst of a fracking-induced revival of the massive Permian Basin oil field.
1938 2018-09-27 20:06:30 I’ll have to check when I get home and get back to you. 
I was dosing every morning with breakfast, using olive oil based droplets.
Currently experimenting with dosing at dinner, & I haven’t had great effects so far, but I’m giving it at least 10 days before I make that call.
1939 2018-09-27 20:06:07 All set up for this weekend's @WorldofOutlaws @craftsman Sprint Car Series Champion Oil National Open at @WilliamsGrove.
1940 2018-09-27 20:06:00 I turned down 'oil sciences and geology' in 1976 because I didn't fancy Leeds!!!
A big problem we have is skills shortages in subjects such as engineering and medicine (docs and nurses) whilst our unis churn out 'creatives'.
1941 2018-09-27 20:05:59 I was sleeping so my dad took my car to get my tire fixed and got me an oil change
1942 2018-09-27 20:05:58 Comb it daily with a fine tooth comb, wash it daily, and use a little bit of product to keep it clean (coconut oil will do if you use a little bit).

Since I have curly hair, I usually go in and get a little clean up because the beard gets curly despite my best efforts.
1943 2018-09-27 20:05:46 i’m really tired of my car needing oil changes
1944 2018-09-27 20:05:39 I was playing Arma 3 and in mission briefing the guy mentioned oil.... Almost instantly 20 or so people who were gearing up yelled "DID SOMEONE SAY OIL" and they started running into the room. Most I've ever laughed while playing Arma TBH
1945 2018-09-27 20:05:31 Palmer's Skin Therapy Oil just feels nice 
1946 2018-09-27 20:05:23 Tea tree oil 
1947 2018-09-27 20:05:16 I remember folks saying similar about #char at 200p, #ppc at 60p and #rrl at 20p to name a few oil juniors. All promised the world and failed to deliver. I hold both uog and tlou but both have delivered little in my eyes over the last 6 months. Market agrees. Time to prove it
1948 2018-09-27 20:05:14 Portugal is now a nuclear-armed state, every country whose leader refuses to be hugged by Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is now a enemy state and will be wiped out of existence by our state of the art arsenal that fuses sardine atoms with olive oil atoms.
1949 2018-09-27 20:05:04 Yes!!! You’re supposed to change your oil every 3-5k miles and doesn’t your car tell your the oil life on it??
1950 2018-09-27 20:05:03 It’s not me, I don’t have that money but I gave advise that it’s only dollars that banks give out.

1957 2018-09-27 20:04:33 Ross, the end of the world will not be determined by Scotland's oil. We contribute a tiny amount to climate change. If we are 100 % renewable Westminster will still find a reason to extract oil from the north sea.
1958 2018-09-27 20:04:18 @Oil_Guns_Merica please explain how #Kavanaugh is not king snowflake after this. If any liberal was half as pathetic as this, you fuckers would be on it like stupid on a southern klansman.
1959 2018-09-27 20:04:01 Not sure. But China is still buying oil from Iran and that doesn't sit well with many folks.
1960 2018-09-27 20:03:57 Its possible,when do you want it and we have to see our naira before we proceed

1966 2018-09-27 20:03:42 Okay look at me giving nutritional advice to the guys at the oil change spot
1967 2018-09-27 20:03:17 Ill gotten gains? Are you on crack? They are clamping down because Venezuela nationalized their own oil. NOTHING ELSE!!!
1968 2018-09-27 20:03:06 This oil change is taking forever
1969 2018-09-27 20:02:49 There’s something about it that just feels so wholesome. I’m a product junkie, but when I find something that works I stick to it. Bio Oil is one of those products. I should get paid for this endorsement 
1970 2018-09-27 20:02:37 @elonmusk Sir, would you consider exploratory funding for building a water pipeline from flooded  southwest/east coast to drought-ridden southwest/west coast? If we can pump oil across the country, we should be able to pump water to fill up Lake Mead.
1971 2018-09-27 20:02:36 @OvernightersUK 2, surely one of you must have known that engine oil is NOT blood red in colour?
1972 2018-09-27 20:02:27 I'm taking Beta Carotene, Garlic and parsley, Salmon oil and vitamin C and Zinc 

Purchased all at Dischem.
1973 2018-09-27 20:02:24 Tea tree oil is one of my least favorite smells so of course it's the only thing that really works for a spot treatment for my pimples
1974 2018-09-27 20:02:11 Anointing oil...
1975 2018-09-27 20:02:07 Lays out a compelling case that fundamental principles are in play here that have held our nation together since inception. This is a pivotal moment and abandoning them now imperils our continued existence.
1976 2018-09-27 20:02:02 Auto-correct don dey fail me. I need a new phone
1977 2018-09-27 20:02:00 Government allows you to buy alcohol and cigarettes. Are those good for you?
Government facilitates the use of oil, in spite of the diseases, accidents and deaths. Governments start wars, causing a lot of suffering.
See the hypocrisy in your reasoning?
1978 2018-09-27 20:01:50 JellyFish Krill Oil also contains the powerful antioxidant Astaxanthin, which gives it its red colour and works as a natural preservative, protecting its omega-3 fatty acids from oxidation, unlike with regular fish oil. Still, best to keep all your supplements in the dark ;)
1979 2018-09-27 20:01:44 He is creating an oil painting of himself, beautiful to behold. It’s just his venom that lets him down. Oh and the Clinton accusation

1983 2018-09-27 20:01:16 Most store bought nuts are roasted in unhealthy oil.  Buy raw nuts and roast them yourself in avocado or olive oil.
1984 2018-09-27 20:01:15 The ‘Oil Apocalypse’ series is high on my wish list. Very much looking forward to getting into it.
1985 2018-09-27 20:01:09 First read the difference between trade/oil & nukes, then talk on this matter. Bye.
1986 2018-09-27 20:01:08 Too few companies are being asked to articulate as you say. Take Palm Oil/rainforest devastation/#climatechange that goes with it-Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever, Colgate=All directly connected to it. Too few in the media are putting CEO feet to the fire for fear of losing ad revenue.
1987 2018-09-27 20:01:02 I would have to ask but around £10K or do it possible?

TCPL is a gas pipeline that was proposed to be partially converted to an oil line via the Energy East project.
1993 2018-09-27 20:00:20 That’s truly wishful thinking, cuz the  only reason I want one is so my Kuerig stays oil free

2002 2018-09-27 19:59:41 It is running out, but it’s through a pipe all the way to England. They have a well at the end of it claiming they’ve struck oil

2007 2018-09-27 19:59:14 You just need to fry it in oil and then add toppings. I've started pre making a rich fatty pesto heavy tomato sauce as a base. The rest is just chopping and topping.
2008 2018-09-27 19:59:06 I hear this alot but witnessed it today

If for any reason as a lady you are at oil mill, slaughter or mile one park,
Before it gets dark make sure you leave there ASAP!!!

A lot of bad things happen there unchallenged by security operatives an usually no one will try to help you
2009 2018-09-27 19:59:03 Are you kidding?  BRETT KAVANAUGH.  The man showed EMOTION - true, gut wrenching EMOTION.
2010 2018-09-27 19:58:52 And joke was on buddy homeboy still changed my oil first 
2011 2018-09-27 19:58:38 Thanks for your question. As all pills and dietary supplements, it is best to store your krill oil in a dry, cool and dark place (not the fridge, but under 100°F/38°C).

2018 2018-09-27 19:57:39 Do you really believe that the US and beyond Israel leave the Arab Gulf or the Middle East safely after all this oil wealth! The United States made Saddam, bin Laden, to justify their intervention. And even the Muslim Brotherhood.
2019 2018-09-27 19:57:26 There is no moral high ground too high that a vegan won't climb to; in their leather shoes, eating palm oil products that trash the planet.
2020 2018-09-27 19:57:08 Will you have a shampoo that won't use ingredients derived from palm oil?
2021 2018-09-27 19:57:00 I've noticed that the right enjoys taking by force.. whether it's another country's oil, a woman's body or our tax dollars.
2022 2018-09-27 19:56:28 She's just one more sad Marxist that can't possibly believe that Socialism fails because it's an unworkable economic model. 
Blaming everything from the price of oil to a conspiracy led by Google.
Even the 2 most ardent communist states have adopted capitalism, because it works
2023 2018-09-27 19:56:28 What's up with the weird spots on Kavanaugh's cheek and bottom lip?  Looks like someone scratched his face or threw hot oil at him!?
2024 2018-09-27 19:56:20 I was going to go get my oil changed and get my car cleaned but guess what I did instead
2025 2018-09-27 19:56:14 He wasn’t my first choice, he is now.
2026 2018-09-27 19:56:09 listen nothing against olive oil we stan her in this household
2027 2018-09-27 19:56:09 @realDonaldTrump won’t like that characterization.
2028 2018-09-27 19:56:06 Canadian heavy oil trading at 'outrageous' $40 discount as global prices rally. Damn maybe me and @stephenharper should have done a better job consulting with first nations and getting pipelines built.  Oh well I'll just blame Trudeau.
2029 2018-09-27 19:56:03 Just imagine Apple getting to a trillion dollars valuation, no oil money investment involved, we need to look outside the confines of oil

2044 2018-09-27 19:54:35 Do you think this is due to the study population having hypertriglyceridemia? If this gives same results to patients w/ normal trigs this could exonerate to some degree fish oil supplementation.

Today, the Canadian crude index stands at $38.64 with our main export, WCS at $30.07. ’s #1 export is worthless as global demand rises. Let that sink in

2057 2018-09-27 19:53:06 GHG intensity isn’t representative of availability, shipping and political disincentive. By your ideology investment should flow to countries with small reserves or shallow wells... guess who wants that oil? Everyone. Now what?
2058 2018-09-27 19:52:58 And tonight I’ll cheat again, and tomorrow I’ll be sorry and I’ll feel kinda dirty because I have the midnight oil all over me

I do believe Ford is suffering some mental condition, but I see no definative proof it is related to Kavenaugh. If I was on a jury, I couldn't convict him at this point.
2060 2018-09-27 19:52:47 I'm sure we all thought it... in fact I thought it was some reference to that, that I didn't quite understand... had he perhaps used cannabis oil on his bod or something 
2061 2018-09-27 19:52:46 I used a block of tofu (12 ounces) 3 tbsp of nutritional yeast, 4 tbsp of olive oil, juice from one lemon, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 cup of basil, 1/2 tsp of peppers and garlic powder to taste - blended this all until smooth

2066 2018-09-27 19:52:21 Our limited reserves of oil and gas will be completely exhausted by the year 2025, at the present rate of consumption. Large corporates and governmental self interest ignore this pending crisis and resist change to the status quo.
2067 2018-09-27 19:51:55 Scheduled an appointment with @pepboysauto for 12:00PM for a simple oil change. It’s 1:50PM, almost 2 hours later and the oil change is still not done. So much for an appointment.
2068 2018-09-27 19:51:19 Nooooo the money needs to be sent from Nigeria to the UK
2069 2018-09-27 19:51:16 That was one of the major stumbling blocks to effective exploration for oil n gas in that part. Big companies cld not get the environmental approvals b4. Now it’s open for business. All the best.
2070 2018-09-27 19:51:15 Wow I'm so sorry America must suck

2077 2018-09-27 19:51:01 “Lampworking” is a form of glasswork where the craftsperson uses a blowtorch (instead of the furnaces used in “glassblowing”). The term refers to the original oil lamps used by ancient glass workers. #FunFact
2078 2018-09-27 19:50:59 Being tough means not funneling money to Iran. Means not buying oil from them,means not circling the sanctions. EU is only concerned
2079 2018-09-27 19:50:59 A friend told me about it a few weeks ago. Also a doctor I know uses it. They both advised the oil spray for under the tongue for me, as I’m prone to anxiety in certain situations and I don’t feel I need it daily. Highly recommended though (pardon the pun)

2095 2018-09-27 19:49:40 Looking for essential oil in my car to help with my terrible mood... pepper spray is the equivalent right? 
2096 2018-09-27 19:49:38 I really need to get an oil change 
2097 2018-09-27 19:49:30 It's oil on canvas?
2098 2018-09-27 19:49:27 Y’all I hate coming alone to get tires or oil change because all these annoying guys
2099 2018-09-27 19:49:15 He put jalepeno oil in it. The tears the tongue.... eeew!

2101 2018-09-27 19:49:14 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
2102 2018-09-27 19:49:14 High on a Thursday evening. Thanks to NLC
2103 2018-09-27 19:49:00 That's a pretty ugly outlook for oil.
2104 2018-09-27 19:48:53 that fuckin coconut oil is still in me eyes. or maybe i'm just dead tired
2105 2018-09-27 19:48:35 Car is getting an oil change. Waiting on it is getting really boring. 
2106 2018-09-27 19:48:23 Driving towards Gothenburg as we speak. Will stop about half way soon   Been to the Nynäshamn oil refinery today for a meeting about bitumen. Fascinating ( for me anyway). Head office pics on Instagram

2108 2018-09-27 19:48:17 Only-children can have issues playing well with others. If you are going to ruin a child's life by bringing one into today's future world, do the right thing and have another so they are at least socially adjusted as they live on water world with no oil.

2111 2018-09-27 19:47:53 I have super bad generalized anxiety ! I honestly use certain strains of cannabis ( its legal here) and essential oils to combat it ! Lavender essential oil and an oil diffuser are something every anxious person needs !!
2112 2018-09-27 19:47:48 had my first round of cbd oil tooooddaay, I feel good
2113 2018-09-27 19:47:37 Americas cost of oil production is very high and is viable only if the oil prices are high. 

That's why the sanctions against Iran, Qatar, Russia, Venuzuella.
2114 2018-09-27 19:47:32 I've never been able to get over how good the Palmer's cocoa butter moisturizing body oil smells ....

2120 2018-09-27 19:46:59 Ifeanyi Ubah (Capital Oil),  Ibeto Cement, so on,  politics almost ruined their business. Of Dangote himself had been a card carrying member of any political party. His business will be hit. Nigeria politicians philosophy is u r either 4dem or against dem

2125 2018-09-27 19:46:28 Oil changes every 3000 miles, only downside is it's white..pain to keep clean.
2126 2018-09-27 19:46:24 What business is being driven out? Where are they going?

Unemployment? Funny, she fought for and got extended EI benefits, and helped create jobs. Most jobs created are in Alberta. 

Carbon taxes are minimal. They will help with R&D to replace oil and infrastructure.

2131 2018-09-27 19:46:09 Oil exploration technologies change and as they do more oil is found, so no one knows for certain what is out there or isn’t.  Why did she not support the legislation cited above to protect our coast no matter the findings?
2132 2018-09-27 19:46:08 Me too.  That's what I'm using and I loveeeee it.  I have pine and lilac oils and it's easy to adjust how strong it smells.  Looks cute also.  They make oil diffuser wall and car plug-ins, you put the oil on a little cotton insert.
2133 2018-09-27 19:46:06 Just eat your democrazy and freedumb. Have you sold it enough to the Libyan people? Tell to the fool, perhaps they will take your snake oil :)
2134 2018-09-27 19:46:05 My family, my dad are pretty fucking white & don't know what the hell is up with the Kavanaughs reviewing past dental appointments & oil changes by the holiday hearth.  Was there a family tradition of establishing & maintaining alibis?
2135 2018-09-27 19:45:44 “if every american who drank beer is suddenly accused of sexual assault this is will be an ugly place” shut your dumbass up you look like you just walked out of j. crew and then took a bath in used frying oil you cryptofascist
2136 2018-09-27 19:45:36 Come to think of it, why do prisoners not die of depression
2137 2018-09-27 19:45:33 I’m no psychology professor but it seems weird to me that your family will one day be housed in different prisons & you’ll be denied the use of extra virgin olive oil for your hair.
2138 2018-09-27 19:45:32 poor in what way?

2142 2018-09-27 19:45:21 I actually love making my own dairy-free 'butter' because it's super easy, tastes better than the store ones, doesn't contain palm oil and keeps a plastic tub out of landfill. Fucking winning.
2143 2018-09-27 19:45:20 First stops in Glasgow were herbalist and Tesco to get some oregano oil, ACV and other essentials to make a tonic to try and kick this cold. Felt pretty crap and just relaxed all day. Hoping I feel better tomorrow :(

2146 2018-09-27 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2147 2018-09-27 19:44:56 Shit I love my dad too but he couldn’t get me to keep oil in my car much less calendars. 

That’s a very personal admission dude always got on my ass about oil levels. Love you pops!
2148 2018-09-27 19:44:48 I want a nigerian uncle to scam the fuck out of my paypal I deserve it after putting oil in my ramen
2149 2018-09-27 19:44:46 Oh Come on, Iran is our Compulsion only because of oil. Tomorrow, you will say if these countries have nukes, then why not whole world? We are tolerating terrorist state Pakistan with nukes, Is this not enough for you?

2161 2018-09-27 19:43:32 Dude it’ll help a lot. We freeze peanut butter some oil and a bit of water and stick it in a toy
2162 2018-09-27 19:43:07 My pleasure. After cleansing my skin, I apply a serum then I use the rosehip seed oil to moisturize. It’s an awesome moisturizer & is actually good for all skin types. I have combination to oily acne prone skin and it really works for me. It’s a really really good product.
2163 2018-09-27 19:42:55 Girl put tree oil and some face masks do the trick!
2164 2018-09-27 19:42:52 Then I use the Gillette 5 blade razors with the soothing ribbons (the green and blue box). After I shave I scrub my legs with sugar scrub, I use 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup oil, a few drops of essential oil to smell nice. Then I shower and wash gently with a loofa to get the oils off
2165 2018-09-27 19:42:32 I have to up the ante for the contest now.  I will throw in one bottle of baby oil for each winner ...  drop
2166 2018-09-27 19:42:30 Perhaps... but your missing the Historical Point Roger...

Fact is we owe our Lifestyle today, to the Individuals of the past who risked their lives on Oil/Coal... these people weren't "Evil" ..there was no way of knowing Future impacts, IF ANY.. 

Let's Applaud their Efforts.

2169 2018-09-27 19:42:12 Yesenia issa joke. It’s probably your oil. If not bring it over to my house Tuesday and I’ll take a look. If you want you can wait till then too and I’ll change your oil
2170 2018-09-27 19:42:10 Rice, onions, soy oil, salt, dill, spearmint, pepper.
2171 2018-09-27 19:42:04 A major oil company would not act as peevishly as WB. At least, they would put profit before vindictiveness.

2178 2018-09-27 19:41:02 In political science, the term banana republic describes a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product, such as bananas or minerals. Like oil.
2179 2018-09-27 19:41:00 Getting my oil change this random dude in here asked was I in a rush so he can get his car done first 
2180 2018-09-27 19:40:58 My last 2 hours of work have been me drawing pictures of space with oil pastels #blessed
2181 2018-09-27 19:40:49 LOL! Yes that too. That Sunday Riley Luna oil is worth it though!
2182 2018-09-27 19:40:44 I really wanna vape cbd oil for my fibro and anxiety but it’s illegal here even though it doesn’t get you high

2194 2018-09-27 19:39:13 $cei #oil  .88% +
2195 2018-09-27 19:39:03 This body oil my mom gave me makes my legs so soft 
2196 2018-09-27 19:38:53 I can't quite count the fingers. Is that 2 or 3 billion you wish to issue?
2197 2018-09-27 19:38:52 helll yeah and makes my hair grow super fast. I have the oil too which is good
2198 2018-09-27 19:38:49 good to know, thanks. do i need to schedule an appointment for an oil change?
2199 2018-09-27 19:38:30 Not a lie but I see what you're saying. The $13 figure includes stripper wells, not just fracking. The published break even for fracked oil tends to be around $60 but that includes fixed profit increase and exploration. Without that just fracking breaks even at around $25.
2200 2018-09-27 19:38:29 It’s been like 2 weeks and I’m still thinking about that oil/fire scene. She really did that...
2201 2018-09-27 19:38:24 Mine is bagels. But apparently I found an oil that gets a certain dude to happily take me to the airport at 6am when he works until 3am. *ahem*
2202 2018-09-27 19:38:15 The good news is that the EU will propose a deal to the USA:

It will swap amerikan oil and nat gas for european goods and services

If with Iran experiment works, then the USA
2203 2018-09-27 19:38:11 @LEPolitique Il faut absolument qu’un journaliste politique ait le courage de dire qu’il faut arrêter de prendre les automobilistes pour des imbéciles:vous pouvez baisser le prix de l’essence pour le ramener au prix du gaz oil et arrêter de nous faire croire que c’est écologique!
2204 2018-09-27 19:37:53 @Headshoulders You have forced me to change shampoo brands after 20 years using your product until you start obtaining palm oil from a responsable company. Drop Wilmar. #dropdirtypalmoil
2205 2018-09-27 19:37:42 I'd say that they'd have to hire the oil companies to get the equipment to do so, but those clowns are so far in bed with them that all they'd need is to bat their eyes.
2206 2018-09-27 19:37:41 Its Engine oil
2207 2018-09-27 19:37:36 You know things are booming in oil and gas when the Best Western in Fairview, OK is $145/night!

2211 2018-09-27 19:37:00 Yep it’s MUCH more milder than the oil. I apply 3 drops to my whole face once I’ve cleansed.
Hmmm I also found the oil to be very strong but then I spoke to someone else and was advised to just apply a drop when a pimple arises and some moisturizer.
2212 2018-09-27 19:36:30 I asked my dad what oil my car takes so Christian can take it to get it changed since ima be at work, but my dad ends up taking it AND washing my car bc he doesn’t want Christian to do it. My dad wants to be the only man in my life to take care of me 
2213 2018-09-27 19:36:29 Banning fake charities with Directors taking £250,000+ salaries would be a start. Seeing as there are Cannabis Oil companies springing up all over the stock market. And you're still researching a cure???
2214 2018-09-27 19:36:27 #Toptip. Bought sundried tomatoes, artichokes, peppers in oil?

2216 2018-09-27 19:36:15 That is a well established technique for tendering octopi. Next step olive oil, garlic and the grille

2220 2018-09-27 19:36:04 Snake oil is limitless.
2221 2018-09-27 19:35:47 Apparently the FROZEN FISH FILLET, which the verdict for whether or not it’s real fish is still out for ... has blood ... so much blood that they have to burn it in oil to hide said blood
2222 2018-09-27 19:35:46 No reason we can't use the pound for a while, might want to change before it collapses without Scottish Oil propping it up

2228 2018-09-27 19:35:13 I shouldn’t need to stock up on Scottish porridge, oatcakes and salmon because you’re in the U.K. for the moment! Just olive oil and wine.
2229 2018-09-27 19:34:49 I have the oil but the serum looks interesting  is it okay for sensitive skin?
2230 2018-09-27 19:34:49 Lol All you really need is the oil & shampoo & detangler is they have it....everything else is unnecessary to me
2231 2018-09-27 19:34:44 And surprise! surprise! they recommend you use as much olive oil as you can and then some! 
2232 2018-09-27 19:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see

2234 2018-09-27 19:33:39 Really excited to be attending the @Colts sports and business forum tonight at Lucas Oil!
2235 2018-09-27 19:33:38 I don’t think there was beard balm/butter in there tho. Only oil and shampoo and conditioner. Plus a whole lotta other shit I can’t use cause bald lol

2241 2018-09-27 19:32:42 The nice thing about not washing your hair in this weather is that the slight oil build-up counteracts the frizziness from the humidity, and it ends up just looking normal.

2244 2018-09-27 19:32:22 I wash my hair max twice a week, and when I do I use Aussie 3 minute miracle reconstructor. I leave it on for ages - while I have a bath, shave, do a face mask w/e. I also use whatever hair oil on my ends and a little throughout the full length if I'm blow drying.

2255 2018-09-27 19:30:59 yes, just check your oil level and see if it’s low. If so, go to autozone and ask for the oil you need and just fill it up. $4 - $8 for the size you’ll need.
2256 2018-09-27 19:30:57 Oui !

2293 2018-09-27 19:26:25 Reducing scar tissue. 
Castor oil is also beneficial to keloid type scars and other various scars. This is because it is capable of deep penetration across multiple skin layers. It can help in softening your skin to a high level so that there is a break down in scar tissue.

2297 2018-09-27 19:25:53 That's a lie. In Saudi Arabia where the oil oozes out, its $25-$30. In America where were have to frac, its about $45-$50.

2310 2018-09-27 19:24:42 It’s not really that much though. The world could be driving electric cars today. You just have to convert all that oil to burn 97 million barrels a day in generators to feed the grid. Bitcoin uses 10k a day.
2311 2018-09-27 19:24:30 Helping thicken eyelashes. 
Apply this oil to your eyelashes with a light hand or old mascara wand. It will help make your eyelashes stronger and thicker, and prevent them from becoming thin and shed.
2312 2018-09-27 19:24:24 All coconut oil did for my skin was break it the fuck out and suffocate it so no, I don’t believe that it’s anything special. Extra virgin olive oil is the shiz tho.

2317 2018-09-27 19:23:16 Vitamin E oil may work  (Not overnight results, it takes a few weeks)
2318 2018-09-27 19:23:09 Yes! You just dry it out a bit (only use a firm one) and then cut it up, stick it in a bowl with soy sauce, bit of oil, pepper and a tablespoon of cornflower. mix it up. and just lay out on a baking tray with parchment paper and bake for about 25 mins. It's so nice.
2319 2018-09-27 19:23:09 This may seem bizarre but I once used oil to remove adhesive that had been baked on by sun.

Just put two drops of castor oil on your hands. Rub them and smooth  through the hair ends. Don’t apply excess amounts as your hair can appear greasy. You can use castor oil as scalp treatment and re-grow hair on the head.

2341 2018-09-27 19:20:41 Yeah exactly when I started using Olive Oil I used it for "frying" ... not for deep frying so much. But AFAICT, you can fry in it, as long as you maintain the temp below its smoke point.

2348 2018-09-27 19:20:02 How does castor oil work? 
You should apply castor oil to you head, eyelashes and eyebrows. Because of it’s thickness it coats your hair and prevents it from falling. It is loaded with omega 9 fatty acids , which gives nourishment to the hair, follicle and skin surrounding them.
2349 2018-09-27 19:19:51 @AdelAljubeir asks are we a banana republic? No, you're a barbaric republic. Surely you realise your appalling human rights record & medieval attitudes are barely tolerated as you have oil? When it runs out you will be offered nothing, least of all any apologies.

2359 2018-09-27 19:17:46 Awesome. Please keep it in a cool dark place. I think it even comes in a dark bottle because it could go rancid if it’s exposed to sunlight cos it’s a cold pressed oil.

2369 2018-09-27 19:16:07 Hey can you guys please stop making them so wet? They drip all over the place and make a huge mess. Taste is amazing and experience is great otherwise, but all the extra oil you guys added in the last six months is a real turn off. They were perfect before.
2370 2018-09-27 19:16:06 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2371 2018-09-27 19:15:55 Finally got an oil change only to be notified that there is a nail in my tire. And then I got a parking ticket even though I plugged the metre. I think today is my day.
2372 2018-09-27 19:15:54 Are you in a state that permits cancer patients to use CBD oil? Weed extract.

It's supposed to make radiation treatment more effective, by protecting the healthy tissue.

Please try it. (I wish McCain had known about it because glioblastoma was the one they studied!)

2377 2018-09-27 19:15:22 How am I doing you may ask? Choking on burning oil fumes because I'm a bitch who can't pour oil right
2378 2018-09-27 19:15:18 I never gave essential oils a chance. But this lavender oil just took my anxiety attack from a 20 to a unrecognizable 3
2379 2018-09-27 19:15:15 If the Scots had voted Yes and then discovered the collapse of oil prices meant independence looked completely different from what they’d been promised, should they have been allowed to vote again if there was popular support for it?
2380 2018-09-27 19:15:12 does anyone know how to get rid of pimple scarring? I thought tea tree oil would work but it doesn’t

2386 2018-09-27 19:14:37 And Ben, dont be put off by double fry, its a big kitchen trick, you blanche the fries, then, oil hot, put them back in, most of the oil is the kitchen towel and it seals the patato. Then bingo, 2/3 minutes you have great fries. And you can churn out a shit load at any time.
2387 2018-09-27 19:14:30 Just don't let it smoke... you can fry all you want ... It's oil for cryin' out loud.

2393 2018-09-27 19:13:57 Eastern Kentucky is such an odd place, I just got my oil changed inside of a liquor store.
2394 2018-09-27 19:13:55 I’ll help. We should all start to investigate and be asking journalists to dig into the characterlogical changes of Graham. He plays golf w Trump & every time comes back speaking the exact same toxic falsehoods & snake oil salesmen like behavior.

2396 2018-09-27 19:13:30 @endurance my agreement says that I need to get an oil change within 30 days of signing up. Can I go to a quick lube joint or does it have to be a mechanic or dealership?
2397 2018-09-27 19:13:24 What excuse? And are you dumb to know that there is interest on returns can be even 500%? What is 10% on investment? Which shareholder is going to be happy about getting 10% on his investment? And you don't know commodities like gold are not like oil?

2400 2018-09-27 19:12:34 I miss my grandma. Made her locust beans sauce today (just ata rodo blended with handfuls of iru, fried in bleached palm oil with onions and garlic and more iru, added green peppers this time) and the nostalgia is seated deep in my belly now.
2401 2018-09-27 19:12:25 Yes o! It really does. All my acne has calmed doooooown. I’m also using The Ordinary’s Niacinamide + Zinc serum. So I wash with Aveeno Salicylic Acid foaming cleanser, apply the Niacinamide + Zinc serum, then the rosehip oil. Blemishes are there still but fading gradually.

2405 2018-09-27 19:11:47 It is simply none of our goddamn business, period and the motives are anything but what is being stated. It is again about the Imperialist efforts to take their oil. How may times do we have to see this?

2412 2018-09-27 19:10:52 Even if income taxes have gone up that does not change the revenue neutral system. Individuals and businesses that spend below average on FF get a lot of money back. The gas prices in your table are also influenced by the crude oil market. The CT on gas is constant at the pump.

2418 2018-09-27 19:10:31 I have textured skin on my cheeks because of the acne so the rosehip oil kinda acts like a primer would. The foundation just melts into my skin & I literally use only 2 pumps of my NARS. And when you set it nko?? Flawless

Gas prices up $1 more than when he took office, while bragging oil exports up. His daily lying is costing him votes -oh so deservedly.
2428 2018-09-27 19:09:30 CBD oil is hemp based - not cannabis based. Proof? CBD oil is legal in every state, can be purchased online and sent through the mail. Cannabis is illegal unless a state has legalized it for medical use.

2436 2018-09-27 19:08:33 Yeah they're fighting for him, just like people in Christian cults who refuse medicine and pour anointing oil on each other are following the Bible, stop excusing your dangerous books because you pick what suits you and leave the rest
2437 2018-09-27 19:08:23 I stopped everything & went back to the basics. I found that rosehip oil was great for acne prone skin. Anti inflammatory, brightening & really moisturizing. What I didn’t expect was that makeup would apply so beautifully over it! It’s like spreading butter when it’s soft.
2438 2018-09-27 19:08:21 Don't know if it's your type of benzo but I have extra Xanax I'm not likely to use if you run out. I've been having very good luck with vaping CBD oil to control panic attacks so I don't need it as much.

2471 2018-09-27 19:04:07 I would far rather use cannabis oil than the opiates I’m currently prescribed for Crohns. It is a more effective analgesic with fewer side effects. Very much looking forward to it being available legally in a pharmaceutically regulated form

2479 2018-09-27 19:03:30 Their sacrifice was for the US, but for what reason?

2491 2018-09-27 19:02:00 My guess is there is something in fish oil that works to lower TMAO which is found in salt water fish and help the body not get too much

2493 2018-09-27 19:01:52 I xsure DHC punya cleansing oil, but both HL & Nutox sesuai for all skin types :)
2494 2018-09-27 19:01:45 I’m pretty darn close to turning off the news in this Walmart oil change waiting room. All I’ve seen and heard today is this kavanaugh trial and hearing terrible awful things said about a poor woman who was assaulted... I don’t  think I can take it anymore.
2495 2018-09-27 19:01:40 The GOP AND Democrats are beholden to the interests of their benefactors (Koch brothers, banks, pharma, big oil etc) instead of the American people.
2496 2018-09-27 19:01:34 "It smell like cigarettes, hair grease and cooking oil in here"

2497 2018-09-27 19:01:22 @realDonaldTrump On an aside note. Gas, Heating oil and oil prices continue to rise. DO SOMETHING!!
2498 2018-09-27 19:01:18 I feel like I woke up and everything that was bad and good got reversed... But if I worked for an oil company maybe I'd feel different.  But only if money became the most important thing in my life. #2differentworlds
2499 2018-09-27 19:01:17 But yeah. I forgot castor oil was a thing.
2500 2018-09-27 19:01:12 Lol coconut oil is good but too much will give them the poops.
2501 2018-09-27 19:01:05 OK was a holdout of the southern strategy. getting rid of democrats who knew how to properly run the state for "new blood" resulted in a bloodbath and massive tax cuts that crippled the state. GOP oil interests carried the day.
2502 2018-09-27 19:00:58 I used shampoo to cook fried/jollof rice. Just because when my sis earlier cooked, d color was similar. So i tot d shampoo was G.Oil. 3tims

2504 2018-09-27 19:00:43 Try rubbing avocado skin on it too if you want. Oily but less than olive oil 
2505 2018-09-27 19:00:37 I've got an idea Donny Jr, pass this along to your dad & the energy dept. We could save oil drilling charges & extract enough oil from your hair to supply the east coast. Do realize you're a dumber version of the worst President in American history, & Eric makes u appear smart.
2506 2018-09-27 19:00:34 Lol so i locked myself out of the house before i left to come get an oil change  how’s y’all Thursday going

2510 2018-09-27 19:00:20 I tend to agree but I don't know if that's because it's snake oil, or because it's too early, or because I just don't understand it.
But much like the dot com bubble there was truth behind the madness, somewhere.

2514 2018-09-27 19:00:08 Why even one environmentalist thinks this is a good idea has only one answer: they are hoping for a catastrophe that in their minds will kill the oil industry forever.  The accident might easily happen (probably will), but it won't stop the oil sands. Build some pipelines!
2515 2018-09-27 19:00:07 Why do you decide to attack the person, SYL has not exposed a single paedophile, he just uses his followers to whip up outrage and imo to fleece them for money that is not accountable. He is a sandale oil salesman.
2516 2018-09-27 19:00:06 I do too shwaya but tbh if it’s flaky then it’s missing some oil

2524 2018-09-27 18:59:29 Plus what stops say the oil companies from buying up the roads and putting some of the costs to drive on the roads in the price of gasoline? As well as toll roads for heavier traffic areas?

2526 2018-09-27 18:59:11 If the car ad claims these items, it really means:
- rough condition = too bad to lie about
- immaculate = recently washed
- burns no oil = it all leaks out
- drive it away = I live on a hill
- drive it anywhere = within 10 miles

2532 2018-09-27 18:57:35 i just want to document that today i got my oil changed on the exact mileage i was supposed to.
2533 2018-09-27 18:57:35 We have RMs with lots of oil activity and right next door have no oil. Busy RM’s have more equipment and less busy have less. Don’t see any difference in equipment quality or how good roads are. don’t see major issues joining the two 
2534 2018-09-27 18:57:24 West Texas has a small refinery. Biggest one near Houston. South Texas is where the oil is at now, with the vast majority of areas still locked down. East Texas has more gas wells than west. And it's not many compared to other states

An increase of any kind increase pump cost

2540 2018-09-27 18:56:31 What’s not widely known fracking took place in Sherwood Forest during the war and continued until the 1960s.  No one complained when we need oil in the 1940s to keep going.
2541 2018-09-27 18:56:25 she still needs oil in her joints
2542 2018-09-27 18:56:19 the question we need to ask ourself is are we all ready to receive the coming of Jesus, are we prepared and do we all have oil in our lamp? How we should answer this question in our mind. Jesus Christ is coming soon

2552 2018-09-27 18:54:41 @realDonaldTrump and no longer should be wasted. We stood firm in our positions, and the necessary measures should be taken to eliminate Iran's entire oil, on November 4, the work of Iran's oil and the Iranian regime should end.

2554 2018-09-27 18:54:29 I used to work in the oil patch, and I always thought it would be an amazing counterpoint to produce some truck vulvas. Surprisingly my co-workers were not into the idea.
2555 2018-09-27 18:54:24 This is really good news. Your State also needs to look into oil fracking, water pumping, coal mining, etc.. Especially right now when high seismic activity has picked up. Those areas are prone to EQs even more.

2570 2018-09-27 18:53:20 If I had to guess: oil. Went from $45/barrel in 04 to >$100 in 08. AB paid more, forcing labour/material costs to rise here? (Doesn’t explain recent ramp-up — that seems more related to worker supply shortage via older workers exiting industry?)

2578 2018-09-27 18:52:28 It won’t drive the economy until green energy is cheaper than oil. The answer isn’t to increase the price of oil. It is to decrease the price of green energy. The latter is the economy driver. All transportation and infrastructure runs on oil.
2579 2018-09-27 18:52:23 Right, OBOR covers several regions. But this is a matter of the oil city in Pak. What you said is exactly my point, it was an offer made by our gov with Chinese support. But confirmation from the Saudis is yet to come. That’s what is concerning. Are they having second thoughts?
2580 2018-09-27 18:52:21 "It should kick in a bit faster?" he whimpered more but already felt the effect of the oil and of course Alec's good hand.

2581 2018-09-27 18:52:13 All right! Another essential oil, natural health enthusiast.  Another aspect of my passions. We have to be extremely careful about what we say about EOs here as the FDA would love to take them out of our hands. So again, 
2582 2018-09-27 18:52:04 Do you know what products use oil

2591 2018-09-27 18:51:07 Why is it that a soldier fighting for oil is seen as serving his country, but a woman sacrificing herself to save her country is seen as a political operative?

2601 2018-09-27 18:49:46 the only good thing about accutane so far is that there’s literally no oil in my hair, im on 4th day hair and there’s still nothing
2602 2018-09-27 18:49:42 Forgot that was a thing. I think they have an oil rig logo they could've pulled out but who knows what it would look like
2603 2018-09-27 18:49:34 When my horse did this I had the vet out to tube and oil him. Could be early signs of colic and better off spending a few hundreds for that than waiting until they are in pain and need surgery 
2604 2018-09-27 18:49:31 I’m not talking about the oil. I don’t care about the oil. I would still fight for Ogaden if it was a barren landscape. You stole it, I don’t care how much what you stole is worth, I want it back.
2605 2018-09-27 18:49:25 Let’s be clear here.  Notley and Justin both hate the Alberta oil industry for different reasons but neither ever wanted Alberta to be able to sell its oil.
2606 2018-09-27 18:49:22 I bet the news didn't tell the gullibles that Venezuela's economy is commodity (oil) rich and is controlled by US sanctions. It's also around 70% private and capitalist! But hey that would spoil the brainwash and doesn't fit the Tory narrative. #MediaFail #Venezuela #ToriesOut
2607 2018-09-27 18:49:17 Pro Tip : Twerking around your kitchen to Fight Night while you're cooking with hot oil will probably result in second degree burns...

so just make sure you went hard enough to make it worth it because your dumb ass ain't gonna stop, are you
2608 2018-09-27 18:49:15 But yes, the oil goes directly in the fryer.
2609 2018-09-27 18:49:14 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil or baby oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade. We also advise that you always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down.

2619 2018-09-27 18:48:20 Butter me sideways and oil me
2620 2018-09-27 18:48:13 Imagine what crisis will result from wood over tile in the kitchen disagreement.
One of the most bizarre aspects of this, is a therapy session over an extra door kicked all this off. Just weird
2621 2018-09-27 18:48:13 Comparing the crude oil price USD $56.75 per bbl on 27.09.2017 with USD $71.38 per bbl on 27.09.2018, does the increase make any impact on the economy, considering the period covered?
2622 2018-09-27 18:48:07 I have never tried dry shampoo, but I use Argan oil on my hair. I'll give it a shot
2623 2018-09-27 18:48:05 Now, all the desis repeat after me: OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING. OLIVE OIL IS NOT FOR FRYING.

2629 2018-09-27 18:47:15 I hate when I go to get an oil change and they try to@sell me another 160$ of bullshit. It’s like Yea Billy I know I am a quart low. Im 2000 miles over due! The fact that my car is still running means it is probably on good shape!
2630 2018-09-27 18:47:09 We have some that are pretty busy with lots of oil activity. Some are half pasture and are pretty low maintenance

2636 2018-09-27 18:46:38 If anyone going tonight would like a free can of brand new dry shampoo with Argan oil in it, let me know. I just got it and used it, and now it looks like I’ve slathered my hair in oil 
2637 2018-09-27 18:46:31 honestly the fact that i procrastinate on getting oil changes is made 1000x worse by the fact that i don’t even have to pay for them myself. i use the company credit card. yes i STILL COMPLAIN IM A USELESS ASSHOLE TRULY

2639 2018-09-27 18:46:17 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.
2640 2018-09-27 18:46:16 Euro exchange rate has the biggest influence on profitability.  I am not too worried about cereals and oil seeds as they trade near world market prices.  Land subsidies end up with landowners, as a tenant a drop in them will not be catastrophic. A bit of me likes disruption!
2641 2018-09-27 18:46:11 Meh, stick it on an olive oil and garlic base and call it a flatbread. The restaurant they are referencing is notable for making surprising things into pizza, you are welcome to de-pizza it. (Their pear arugula pizza is great)

2643 2018-09-27 18:46:03 While the Oil & Gas industry gathers a sense of relief that things are showing steady hints of warmth, it's impossible not to have a sense of foreboding at all the whimsical hyperbole now exploding because of a few weeks at a higher price.

2692 2018-09-27 18:41:04 In the oil gas industry, if you are bringing on a new production line it can take time to commission it. Delays are the normal for new assets. Until the site is in full production you wouldn’t count down time as a loss as it hasn’t begun producing. They disclosed delays.

2750 2018-09-27 18:36:58 And you need to understand sarcasm... the bottom line is you don't have any power or knowledge to claim the oil in ogaden...which you are after.
2751 2018-09-27 18:36:44 senka also same, i dah google semua about cleansing oil yang ada dkt drugstore and for me i suka HL, simple and nutox
2752 2018-09-27 18:36:38 It is the age of the women after millenniums.
Like oil wealth for poor Arabs in mid seventies after millenniums of poverty!
Just roll along, if you can't ride the wave!!
2753 2018-09-27 18:36:24 I don't know where you were in 1975, but the country was not on its knees.  The oil had just started flowing & should have made the UK rich.  Nothing to do with the EU.  Greed enters the scene when business & bankers rule with EU blessings and where did the last crash come from?
2754 2018-09-27 18:36:19 WHAT?! Sigh. I assumed there was more than just potatoes oil and salt but NINETEEN??
2755 2018-09-27 18:36:17 I’m in agreement too, I know that’s deliberate for the shoot (hate the oil) he’s proved his point congratulations to him now time time to back up somewhat. Hope he won’t go obsessive.
2756 2018-09-27 18:36:14 $10 said they make oil with it or sell it as pre-milled 
2757 2018-09-27 18:36:04 Those hoping that Nigeria will change without proper regional Restructuring are joking...A country where elections are kill and rig yet some people will congratulate themselves for maiming and killing others. Democracy isn’t working here while the presence of oil is still a curse
2758 2018-09-27 18:36:01 Asked Cody to bring me weed to the bath so I could smoke a bowl. & he brought me the bong already loaded with oil on top 

He knows me so well I love that man.

2765 2018-09-27 18:35:16 Reading from the Unioninst handbook of sad old lies are we? It is about time they updated it as all these claims have been well debunked. Just like the one that says the Oil is running out! :D If UK Sub Scotland. Why do they want us to stay in union?
2766 2018-09-27 18:35:15 Despite being oil rich.  What would they be like without?
2767 2018-09-27 18:35:15 Money is the oil that keeps the machinery of our world turning
2768 2018-09-27 18:35:09 As if that was not bad enough. You're looking at the end of all social programs except for oil companies and banks.
2769 2018-09-27 18:34:53 Verily dude. When oil and water meet.

2774 2018-09-27 18:34:27 Iran has already been ruined by the regime for the past 40 years, literally anything that makes Iran a country are whatever that's left from the shah era despite trillions of $$ in oil revenues that the mullahs plundered and spent to destabilize the world
2775 2018-09-27 18:34:26 lots of refineries in Eastern Canada - but rather than build Energy East Pipeline...they would rather import 750,000 barrels of oil from South America and the Middle East where the env. standards are way below Canadian Oil companies...but we don't see any protestors over there.?

2777 2018-09-27 18:34:12 In my opinion since our culture is heavy in frying, when we read "optfor /switch to olive oil" we take it as a replacement for veg oil. Hence the confusion in general.
2778 2018-09-27 18:34:09 Todo el álbum es una pasada, lleno de temazos, pero hoy me quedo con "Cover you in oil"...

2780 2018-09-27 18:34:04 Solutions are always in the works. Oil companies are constantly working on reduction of GHG, especially CDN Canadian companies to comply with our strict policies. Your solution of reducing CDN output in favour of foriegn output with less strict policies is the misguided one.
2781 2018-09-27 18:34:02 Yes, I can do that and will throw in a full body oil massage at no charge!!  !!@@!!

2783 2018-09-27 18:33:48 No real recipe. Just poured stuff in to it. Oil in pot. Garlic and ginger into pot for a minute or two. Celery and carrots. Onion powder, thyme and sage. I used a rotisserie chicken cut up, skin removed. 8 cups of chicken broth. Simmer for 40 mins or so then egg noodles till done

2786 2018-09-27 18:33:40 Not watching important things unfold today because my cbd oil has not yet arrived and the thought of a woman having to tell a room full of white men about her assault is terrifying. I can’t even tell my friends, they don’t believe me.

2822 2018-09-27 18:30:39 That's a horrendous amount of oil on a brand new chain.  Are you sure they changed it? How worn is your cassette? It's often a good idea to change both at the same time

2874 2018-09-27 18:26:18 Conservatives don't understand empathy as a genuine motivator.  They don't get that we actually CARE when birds die in oil spills, or kids are locked in cages, or people are raped.

They only have a twisted idea of empathy as a way of manipulating people, so that's what they see.
2875 2018-09-27 18:26:15 The way India, as the 2nd major importer of Iran's crude oil following China, play a vital role for Iran since the main source to finance Iran is its oil. how will India deal with Iran on this issue?

2891 2018-09-27 18:24:15 That is not the issue. Remaining in UK does not bring value to the UK going by his statement on "our GDP", and "alternative to oil". Take note: GDP has ONLY to do with DOMESTIC, economy, in this case, ONLY Nigeria. GNP and GDP are not the same. Use Google. It might help you.

2932 2018-09-27 18:19:20 Yes, wages have been beating core inflation for a while now, headline inflation moves with oil prices up and down, unless oil goes to $105-$115 the wage aspect is at the best levels of the cycle now
2933 2018-09-27 18:19:16 It's lotion oil
2934 2018-09-27 18:19:00 Also in the #DragonBear sleeve is $RSX, which has had a really big jump in the last month and she went from being down 10%+ to down only 1% so that was a decent hold. Probably rising due to some upward price pressure in $WTI since it is heavy gas/oil via Rosneft/Gazprom/Lukoil

2944 2018-09-27 18:17:51 the healthiest option would be to use a griddle pan to grill, an oven to cook. If you're looking for a healthy option for frying kebabs, look at toasting them on a hot pan with very little oil. You need fats in your life to be healthy, look for healthy fats to add to your diet.

2949 2018-09-27 18:17:26 West Texas has most of the infrastructure in place for increased oil and gas production. Ten bucks more would have a negative effect on Americans selling oil and gas to Americans.

As with $HP oil gave these guys a big jump this week but now we see doji's and other types of "indecision" candles. Its better to take the gains and regroup later even though these are high value divy positions.

3022 2018-09-27 18:09:58 Oil Prices edged higher, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supply once U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in just five weeks’ time.

3037 2018-09-27 18:08:02 That does not produce a lot of income. Much of these earnings the city makes stay with the rich. And also much of our incomes go towards a ridiculous property tax that’s inflated by the oil boom.

3039 2018-09-27 18:07:46 I think mine is due to dry eyes. When that happens, apparently, the body compensates by over producing tears. I just upped my krill oil to see if it helps.

3041 2018-09-27 18:07:33 Absolutely correct. I remember BBC Scotland doing a raft of programs when the oil price was low - news programmes, documentaries across their platforms. I’m sure they’ll do the same now it’s high again.
3042 2018-09-27 18:07:10 Wild guess, but it could be because Kavanaugh doesn't want to admit he took money from his wife's family (this rests on the assumption that his wife comes from Texas oil $, she's from TX and obviously has ties to W., so not far fetched)

Certainly NOT contributing to the UK economy (which is not oil-based). GDP has no link with international trade. "Remain in the UK" makes no sense.

3070 2018-09-27 18:04:33 What are you on about?
The issue is has Notley been a supporter of the oil industry or not. I say she has been out to destroy it through regulations. I specifically mentioned LMR.
Try to keep focused.

One week after President Trump tweeted his latest demand for OPEC to cut oil prices (presumably by boosting production), Saudi Arabia is reportedly considering doing just that.
3130 2018-09-27 17:58:38 Lol no i don't mean 5 at a time, I mean i last that long the oil dries out.
3131 2018-09-27 17:58:30 a #5 doesn't normally come with mayo. just oil and vinegar. it's my go-to.
3132 2018-09-27 17:58:28 they make oil blot sheets
3133 2018-09-27 17:58:21 wow come to get an oil change and they tell me everything that’s wrong with my car so i end up spending $300 instead of $60

We must encourage scientific literacy, so that rich women vaccinate kids and stop buying snake oil from the Paltrows of the world.

3144 2018-09-27 17:56:39 @NathanOHagan do you have any winter care advice, oh lawnmower guru? Do you have to drain the oil, or owt like that?
3145 2018-09-27 17:56:36 Where can I buy promise salve oil
3146 2018-09-27 17:56:30 Avoid multiple hair treatments. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Get at least 7 hours sleep. Is it NISIM or NHB? A hair loss shampoo. or close to it. How on earth do I locate the legitimate url. So flexible. Hope to find it.
3147 2018-09-27 17:56:16 I meant oil for food not arms lol yes of course he's anti Semitic his Miryam project was shown to have benefited him personally from Saddam he's a bent self serving nasty little Scottish rabble rouser. He'd be a football hooligan in another life.
3148 2018-09-27 17:56:01 We hear a lot of chat about the purity of olive oil, ie. other oils being mixed in by dodgy producers. How do you know  if your olive oil is the real deal? Put it in the fridge, if goes cloudy like in the photo below, it’s all good. #qualitycontrol #yycfood
3149 2018-09-27 17:55:53 So far i use biore cleansing oil..not bad for my very2 oily skin..
3150 2018-09-27 17:55:51 African black soap, witch hazel and mi usually moisturize with raw African shea butter but it heavy yf so mi switch to cokenat oil.

3180 2018-09-27 17:52:49 Yeah I will look into a speech from 1928 because it’s probably a justification for America’s current oil greed, that will open my eyes for sure...
3181 2018-09-27 17:52:49 1. It's not their money, it's those who pay taxes and would rather have it spent on the NHS rather than free booze.
2. Keep your nose out and stick to Washington. The last thing we need is American interference, go and start a war somewhere and tell yourselves it's not about oil.

3190 2018-09-27 17:52:19 I love bangernomics. I had two Mondeos before the Vectra that did 100k miles each without so much as an oil change. Vectra went so expensively wrong to the point it’s not worth fixing.

3237 2018-09-27 17:47:15 He probably doesn't know that the only revenue the state gets from oil is from taxes, and that Swinney begged Osborne to slash the tax on oil companies. Osborne kindly obliged.
3238 2018-09-27 17:47:13 Nah.....too quick. Suggest flaying, swabbing flayed areas with vinegar mixed with salt, then boiled in oil....slowly, ever so slowly
3239 2018-09-27 17:47:06 I don't have a pool.  If you mean fuel, then my point is that we have to phase out the tar sands--which means less oil by rail and no new pipelines.  If you know which gas station has Alberta gasoline, let me know.
3240 2018-09-27 17:47:05 i'm really sick of buying gas, getting oil changes, replacing tires and all the million other things that can go wrong

3247 2018-09-27 17:46:20 And if Trump is wrong by 2050, we will remember that. I’m glad we agree from a global stand point. That’s what I was basically saying how I think Trump sees the deal and he knows Germany is an ally and is questioning them why they are buying oil from Russia.

3260 2018-09-27 17:44:51 I would send one if I thought it confirmed to dietary restrictions.  I make fruit cake that even my vegan stepson can eat.  Only issue would be the oil I used.
3261 2018-09-27 17:44:25 Meat yes but i wouldn’t say loaded and oil & vinegar. It still be more lettuce than meat or dressing. I ain’t finna eat a dry ass salad. I don’t even eat croutons no more

3267 2018-09-27 17:43:51 Let’s take the wild assumption you actually found oil. A) where does the cash come to drill. B) Whose going to build the pipe to export the crude + regs to build it. C) This New Israeli crude has a 0 refinery’s that run its grade globally. D) Zero export capacity in the nation.

3269 2018-09-27 17:43:48 We've just been told that it's an oil that operates as a buffer around electrical wires and it's non toxic.
3270 2018-09-27 17:43:40 @itvnews What's going to happen in Venezuela you ask, the USA as usual has threatened to overthrow the government..like in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, etc, they want to steal the oil.

Iran has oil
OPEC refused to increase production to cover embargoed Iranian oil (I believe)

3290 2018-09-27 17:42:23 So you just toss the veggies in the oil and place in the fryer? And then the fryer blows hot air around? I was thinking the fryer actually dispensed the oil needed to fry the food, but it sounds like you put whatever oil (if any) directly on the food and "fry" from there! Chips?

3304 2018-09-27 17:41:01 I see Brent crude is currently touching $82 a barrel. Seems the price of oil is only newsworthy when it's falling.

3308 2018-09-27 17:40:37 Venezuela yes relied on its oil far too much for its economy to become strong. However, it's done for the poor far far more than the Tories have done or ever likely to do. Venezuela is struggling from the US stranglehold sanctions & threatened 'regime' change scenario

each one a lost moment,
waiting to be reclaimed as ours.

3512 2018-09-27 17:20:50 Did you know that Ted Cruz authored legislation in favor of the Keystone pipeline thru east Texas? He thinks it’s ok for Texas farmers to lose their family farms by way of eminent domain and for the benefit of a Canadian oil company.

Who’s he really working for?

3517 2018-09-27 17:20:25 I don't think 56,000 naira worth of salary is impractical. What I think is impractical is an oil producing country unable to meet this limit. We should elect people who can meet that by raising enough funds.

3564 2018-09-27 17:17:24 It’s really easy once you know the trick. Rice cookers spend too much energy to be efficient. Wash the rice, put in enough water to cover the rice (a thumbnail over is perfect for a fluffy sticky result) Add salt and oil. Boil then reduce to a simmer until ready :•)

3632 2018-09-27 17:11:03 Yesterday was a rough day. Like ROUGH. So I did what any sane person would do. I drove to @ChickfilA for a pick me up. Imagine the hurt when I bit into a soggy, room temp fry that tasted like it’d been cooked in last weeks oil.  Not even Polynesian sauce could help.
3633 2018-09-27 17:10:51 What evidence do you have for that? The US doesn't need their oil.

3638 2018-09-27 17:10:22 Far too technical for me.  Anyway, I do recall somebody mentioning a fishing trip at Horse Hill the other day.  My first thoughts were, oh that's nice the lads are having a bit of a break with their rods.  I couldn't for the life of me work out where the pond was.  Heigh Ho!

3660 2018-09-27 17:08:44 U.K. has nearly £2tn debt and a £40bn deficit. You can’t subsidise yourself never mind scotland which has a budget of c£30bn and raises £60bn in partially allocated taxation. Offshore sakes direct to ship of oil not allocated to Scotland is estimated at £30bn+

Oil prices are going up & oh dear, we're losing so much $$ being held hostage to the U.S. market w/o that pipeline.

3682 2018-09-27 17:06:07 I grew up with many of these pampered sons of doctors, lawyers or oil execs. They have no idea what the world is really like, because their feet never touch the ground. That level of privilege often produces entitled adult men who think the whole world is beholden to them.

3686 2018-09-27 17:05:37 Nuclear is much cleaner than coal or oil.  It has a far superior safety record, too.  My problem is that is hugely expensive.  Many expenses are hidden, too.  Decommissioning a retired plant, for example,  costs tens to hundreds of millions and that's funded by taxpayers.

3691 2018-09-27 17:05:26 Not the end though. This project doesn’t stop us from importing large amounts of oil, nor does it open up a massive market for us regardless. The US and Middle East own these markets—Canada needs Canadian oil, not export its own and import another.

3700 2018-09-27 17:04:48 Every prayer of yours is answered by God with CORN (revelation of God's word), WINE (manifestation of God's spirit) and OIL (the anointed).
3701 2018-09-27 17:04:46 Can you guess the name of the healthiest fat on the planet? If you have guessed “Extra Virgin Olive Oil,” you are right! Since the oil contains monounsaturated fats, it can help lower cholesterol and control insulin levels.
3702 2018-09-27 17:04:45 Do you already have an oil or electric heating and cooling system? We can convert it! Natural gas HVAC could save you as much as 40% on your heating cost as well as reducing CO2 emissions by 27 lbs.
3703 2018-09-27 17:04:43 They are claiming it is a CBD water, but made from anhydrous hemp oil. I don't believe it has a high CBD concentration and will not provide the effects the same as a CBD oil. The point is that pumpers want this to skyrocket like it's a true CBD product when it is not.

3707 2018-09-27 17:04:31 Totally clueless.  Ask the Conservatives why they sold out Alberta to big oil, our Heritage Fund has Zilch / got very little back from big oil because of mismanagement of royalties by Alberta Conservatives.  The little that was received from big oil was mismanaged as well.

3711 2018-09-27 17:04:21 I will give you her honest review ;) When I can afford it myself, I wish to try some CBD oil also as have read it is great for gym goals. Hopefully I will purchase some from you while you still have the promotion.
3712 2018-09-27 17:04:15 You know, I think that's the basic issue here of these two men. Ford has a conscience, he is broken and ashamed. Kavanaugh does NOT have those feelings. No remorse only denial. K believes everyone will come around and believe his snakeskin oil way. They always have.

3717 2018-09-27 17:03:58 A quote from someone else that sums it up nicely: The NYSE could crash to 500 at any time! The US dollar can become worthless someday. In the near future oil may have little to no demand due to new technologies in the energy markets. The future value of anything is unknowable.
3718 2018-09-27 17:03:58 Lol I love the unique new ways they have been naming table pricing for these event and parties. Like for NAIJA independence table package some are “Gov Politician Money” “oil and gas money” “missing funds efcc” lol

3725 2018-09-27 17:03:24 Agree, but people should be aware that this oil is scheduled to come into the market regardless. When it does show up they shouldn’t think it’s a “reversal” by DOE or be surprised by it given Perry’s statements yesterday

3732 2018-09-27 17:02:37 Amazon does not allow CBD products. It's really a gamble because you wouldn't really know until you get it. It could just be hemp seed oil. Best thing to do if you are buying on amazon is to look at the brands website

3750 2018-09-27 17:01:37 Further down in that link:
"Hemp stalks have a much lower concentration of cannabinoids, meaning a larger amount of the plant has to be processed to extract CBD, raising the risk of contaminants being accumulated from the soil."
The oil can contain many other phytocannabinoids
3751 2018-09-27 17:01:36 There are 6,212 tourism jobs in #HRBC.

3752 2018-09-27 17:01:36 It has been explained to the City that the Oil is similar to cooking oil.

3799 2018-09-27 16:58:39 Yes exactly! The point of the recipe, traditionally, was actually not just make yummy shallots but to flavor the oil for other recipes!

Of course, you really can’t reuse it more than a few times or you get the kind of broken down oil that’s massively bad for you, but still!

3814 2018-09-27 16:57:34 And your dear leader, the , directly caused oil prices to increase resulting in gasoline prices up over $1/gallon. That money goes to other countries. The $10 would have gone to Texas or U.S. and benefited all of us.

3836 2018-09-27 16:56:10 the rally in soy oil the past 6 days has been exceptional , high volume/ strong price.
3837 2018-09-27 16:56:05 Okay Teddy pay attention. Crude oil costs approximately $13 per barrel to produce including all operating and overhead costs. They sell for over $60 dollars. Meaning if they pay back $10 per gallon to your state they make about $47 profit per barrel.
3838 2018-09-27 16:55:59 Cook with it instead of oil or just add it into dishes for extra richness and fat. Like when I make pasta or sauteed veggies, I like to add a chunk of butter at the end

3841 2018-09-27 16:55:46 While an oil change is something that you can do if you're so inclined, some other auto maintenance procedures are far more involved. Timing belt replacement for instance requires special tools and in-depth knowledge of engines, so the job is better left to professionals.

3992 2018-09-27 16:47:41 The industry loves to tell the lie that they need #TransMountain & other pipelines to offset oil by rail and to sell to other countries
This is the truth however
Massive tar sands expansion
This would make a mockery of Canada's GHG emissions targets

3997 2018-09-27 16:47:28 I guess you have no interest in numbers, like doubled GDP after the nationalization of oil reserves and I don’t have memes to offer, sorry.
3998 2018-09-27 16:47:16 I agree with most of this but swap oil and ducks positions. Everything else makes sense to me

4007 2018-09-27 16:46:41 I don't think you understand what an OBA is, George.  It's a rate at which emissions credits are allocated on the basis of output.  There is no cap of any sort on aggregate- or facility-level emissions from oil sands in the CLP report. This is like your reading of election laws.

4026 2018-09-27 16:44:27 Heavy oil (I believe from Canadian tar sands) is being sold at its origin for $40 less than Brent benchmark crude. I think the discount is mostly due to transportation rather than specific gravity or quality.
4027 2018-09-27 16:44:17 Some arbitrary restrictions by Mr

It is spreading a big turmoil in global oil and energy market and is the part of "make #America great" ambition akin to Chinese #BRI project.

go get your oil changed. My 26 year old grown ass male coworker hasn’t gotten an oil change in THREE(?) years so 
Stop acting like the only ones who may not have common knowledge on seemingly obvious things are women. 
4051 2018-09-27 16:41:42 Norway’s 2 biggest exports are oil and fish. The tariffs are low on oil because the EU needs it. They pay almost as much per capita as the UK just to be in the Single Market.
4052 2018-09-27 16:41:33 Them shits slipped off once I put the oil on it glad to have them off

4055 2018-09-27 16:41:03 Hold on. Oil in general is not water soluable. This brand says all over their website that they use water soluable CBD. It says right there on the picture you posted their CBD is Isolate - which is a powder, not an oil.
4056 2018-09-27 16:40:55 Would you like a FREE bottle of CBD oil

4062 2018-09-27 16:39:59 Now, but for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
4063 2018-09-27 16:39:49 Oh, that’s not bad at all. It just needs seasoning. Flax seed oil is the best for this. Expensive but worth it. Put a little in, rub most of it off with paper towel leaving a thin coat, bake in the oven at 375 for an hour. Do it again as needed.
4064 2018-09-27 16:39:35 Before the advent of gold futures, the price of gold was what oil exporters said it was.  Post-gold futures, the price of gold is what Central Banks say it is.  If the price of gold goes back to what oil exporters say it is, gold isn't priced in the correct postal code today.
4065 2018-09-27 16:39:35 Given that we can't burn any more than about 15% of known reserves, do you believe that 85% of extracted oil won't be burned? And that isn't counting gas, which doesn't exactly have many other uses.
4066 2018-09-27 16:39:31 it’s a facial oil! i just put it on before my moisturizer but I’ve seen ppl say they use it before putting on makeup too

4068 2018-09-27 16:39:21 Southern #RVA will soon get the state’s first medical cannabis oil dispensary. The Maryland-based company @gLeafMed has been awarded conditional approval to build a facility in Manchester that processes and sells medical-grade #CBD oil.

4070 2018-09-27 16:39:14 Yeah I work at a local Auto Parts store and I cannot count the number of people that come in to get oversize oil drain plugs because the Wal-Mart tech had stripped it out.  We also get several to get a battery because they refuse to honor the warranty on the battery.

Sounds like a London Gold Pool 2 run on gold to me...& phys flow data supports that view.
4089 2018-09-27 16:36:27 kalau dari oil n gas nak kerja ladang takpe kan ? ke ada jugak mulut busuk yg mengata ? 
4090 2018-09-27 16:36:24 If cost of mining gold relative to oil doesn’t increase 5x how will this happen? Otherwise all oil will leave China and all gold will end up in China.

4102 2018-09-27 16:35:00 1. Oil city in Gwadar will put Jabal Ali zone (UAE) out of business.
2. Oil exporters are very sensitive to even small drops in price caused by >output. It throws their budgets off by many billions.

4135 2018-09-27 16:30:38 Sadly, I don't have the gear to mount a tire.  On occasion, though, I'll get an oil change there, and then the next time I try to do it myself, they've torqued the filter on so tight that I can't get it off.  Can't imagine the torque on these lug nuts.

4182 2018-09-27 16:25:42 A country that relies purely in its oil exports for finance can never succeed in developing itself. Poor schools, bad roads, insecurity, no power supply. Its 2018 and we still have this many issues to fix, how did it become so bad?????
4183 2018-09-27 16:25:22 My cousin went to the clinic because she had the flu, they told her to go home and mix oil with vinegar she'll be fine. Lol. I'm defeated!

For two reasons: 1. to prevent Iran from becoming an important geostrategic actor and 2. for Israel to claim the Golan for good, important for geostrategic reasons,  water sources and oil.
4195 2018-09-27 16:23:45 I will do more research on the quality of your oil, I am still sad you changed it :-) There aren't many other options out there. Thank you for the explanation.
4196 2018-09-27 16:23:45 You should go to the last place you got an oil change and make them compensate you for doing that shit. Awful.
4197 2018-09-27 16:23:40 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
4198 2018-09-27 16:23:18 Of course they engage in war for greed. Iraq was invaded to steal oil & destroy her land & power. But there are more countries involved than just US/UK & they are the prime movers wd u not say?
4199 2018-09-27 16:23:18 That’s like her pouring motor oil in the gas cap because she wanted to make sure your car was good.. again bad help is no help, in fact it’s more work

4201 2018-09-27 16:23:00 there is a human heart beating visibly here - & it's taken a traumatising but brave testimony to show the US what standing up for what's right looks like.

4204 2018-09-27 16:22:44 Why had Congress delayed buying the machines to clean the sewerages by machines than manually? Do you want oil tankers type trucks cleaning sewerage these days & sewerage men need not to do manually but do to make extra bucks than MC instructions? What can govt do if suicide?
4205 2018-09-27 16:22:37 I remember going to a Costco Roadshow and commenting about the oil being hard to disburse from my refrigerator. I will never forget the gals response explaining how that was the only way to use healthy oil. From that day forward that was my judge of good quality salad dressing..
4206 2018-09-27 16:22:30 My question is what happens to the “defendant” was a juvenile? I know people who in High School were absolute pigs but as adults would NEVER consider doing anything of the sort.  There is no intent of good here—she would have alerted the police and not a political party. Lies!

4210 2018-09-27 16:22:13 How does renewable energy require oil? When my neighbours had a 29-panel solar array installed onto their roof, they didn't also install an oil tank.

Oil is needed to make some of the things we use (but alternatives can & are being found); it's burning it that's problematic.

4227 2018-09-27 16:20:43 Started a shiitake tincture months ago & am curious how this will react in a dashi I’m getting ready to make. It’s a grain alcohol base. I thought of maybe doing it as an oil but wanted to grab the entire essence & research said go alcohol. It’s SOOOO potent. Like eating dirt 
4228 2018-09-27 16:20:42 If the government finds oil (like Turkana) in your backyard, its government property. Today @NPSOfficial_KE found bang' in my backyard and they insist its mine. Sad!

4234 2018-09-27 16:20:06 How did this come pass? Through apathy of the masses? or misplaced  hopes of the passionate? or by those bedazzled by the charm of snake oil salesman?
4235 2018-09-27 16:20:04 What I don't get is why consumers pay for these taxes. Should be covered by oil companies

These would only get an advisory in an MOT (oil leak, slight leak from flexi), or can’t even be tested (battery, brake fluid)

4251 2018-09-27 16:18:22 That's a shame. How will we cope with all that oil! And the gas they found off Orkney! It should have run out by now! Our case for independence is getting stronger by the day Bill. Saor Alba gu brath

Your app gives the option of "butter packets on the side" but I always end up with the oily disaster anyway.
4262 2018-09-27 16:17:06 Good nudes involve natural lighting, good angles, coconut oil, sometimes water and sometimes black and white filters...and sheets
4263 2018-09-27 16:16:50 Where is the profit located in Nuclear? Designers, operators, builders, fuel processing, reprocessing, storage? Where is the opportunity for Monopoly profits? I can't see any.

That's why nuc. didn't grow like oil. Uranium isn't scarce enough.
4264 2018-09-27 16:16:45 I agree. Unregulated oil refineries all up and down the “cancer coast” here in the south and these good republicans can’t figure out  why theyre getting all these cancers and dying in their 50s. Take responsibility for fostering a no regulation heavily polluted environment.

See that oil; it can make you fufilled in life just by tasting it.

4268 2018-09-27 16:16:08 As it mturns out that water is more valuable than oil.

4289 2018-09-27 16:14:02 Hello @PoliceUg please note that there's a slippery surface on the Old Port Bell road from the junction onto 3rd street to off 4th street Industrial area.  Oil seem to have been poured.  Many motorcycles and bicycles are falling down @AKasingye @metpoliceug @OkothOchola1
4290 2018-09-27 16:13:58 Biggest oil reserves in the world and they have gasoline shortages. Impressive.
4291 2018-09-27 16:13:40 I was sitting in a waiting room (oil change) & every men in the room was blatantly ignoring the tv. ( I asked for the hearing to be turned on). They were extremely uncomfortable. I'm sure it was turned off the minute I left.
4292 2018-09-27 16:13:36 I am the son of billionaire oil prospector Zebulon Smith who was jailed for tax evasion and bribery in 1923. I inherited his billions through a shady foundation, which pays me an income of $12,734,280.05 per annum, which I mostly spend on shrooms and League of Legends.
4293 2018-09-27 16:13:35 The same contradictions are there in energy in large part because of the lack of progress in cutting transport emissions, i.e. we still need oil because we still drive petrol an diesel vehicles.  The other main area of concern is energy for heat because of out poor housing stock.
4294 2018-09-27 16:13:33 Also, all of these strategies are superior to "dig oil out of ground, sell for USD's, lend USD's to US to build bombs to drop on you."

4307 2018-09-27 16:12:08 I don't really talk about that stuff but this last year has been especially trying on my body and brain, and CBD oil has been really helpful. That's about all I'll say on that.
4308 2018-09-27 16:11:59 what i do with the moisturizer at the end is i only use a little bit and mix it with two drops of Tea tree oil and like 8 drops of rosehip oil. adding the oils is good for combatting natural oil production so your skin won’t be as oily

4310 2018-09-27 16:11:52 Bjp has looted in four years much more than any party by way of taxing policy in form of exorbitant GST rates, taxes on petrol and diesel, not passing benefit of low oil price. Do not be prey of propaganda. Be wise and serve your nation.

4312 2018-09-27 16:11:49 Not much grease was involved. I used coconut oil and fish oil. I think I just need to start drinking more water and less coffee. Maybe just more water because I don't have bail money if I drink less coffee.
4313 2018-09-27 16:11:42 It's worse than that. It's not that they don't understand "the algorithm," it's that they don't understand marketing, or what the audience wants, or what individuals want, or that audiences differ. The truth is there are no experts but there are a lot of snake oil salesman.

4317 2018-09-27 16:11:15 Not hard to imagine that #China ignores Trump's Iranian oil sanctions until the trade dispute is resolved. Interesting to note that that Iran is an ally of Russia via Syrian ruling family, but also an oil rival.

4328 2018-09-27 16:10:21 Thanks for the reply! Not frustrated, love the saw and just concerned. From what I can discern there is no oil in that case so it would seem that it could only come from the grease of one of the shielded/sealed bearings that has gotten warm/thin and leaked out?

4340 2018-09-27 16:08:55 I have another question, when will Canada put the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia on a terror watch list? Of course that means we would have to stop selling them weapons and buying their oil.
4341 2018-09-27 16:08:53 It's used as a filler for processed meat products and the oil is used in everything too. People say that humans arent supposed to eat it but Im not sure if I buy that. I did switch from soy to almond milk when i came across that years ago. Much better.
4342 2018-09-27 16:08:52 Gee other countries are pursuing comprehensive measures to move away from petroleum products. This is just step one. I'm pretty sure if we put our minds to it we can begin to develop products without oil.

4372 2018-09-27 16:05:21 Does one really have anything to do with the other or simply a reduction in cost of oil.  Politics being what they are, DoFo could be trying to take advantage of something he had nothing to do with.

4389 2018-09-27 16:03:25 Oil changes are definitely the higher priority but it all depends on how many miles you put on the car. The more you drive the more tire rotation I’d recommend
4390 2018-09-27 16:03:20 Interesting.
4391 2018-09-27 16:03:18 It's the palm oil - they cut down forests to plant the palms for oil.

4410 2018-09-27 16:01:37 Oil isn’t just turned into Petrol and Diesel. 
The Pharmaceutical and other industries need oil too...

4415 2018-09-27 16:01:07 I had a random bump yesterday on my forehead and this morning I feel it less swollen already. I think that UFO oil is magic. (Im taking pics everyday cause I want to see how my red bumps and overall dryness heals) (will post them in about a week)
4416 2018-09-27 16:00:49 Yes, #scientists get things wrong.

4421 2018-09-27 16:00:19 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4422 2018-09-27 16:00:12 お好み焼きええな！！
4423 2018-09-27 16:00:11 Pfft, more oil is always the answer! Lets just drink oil instead of water, easy. 
4424 2018-09-27 16:00:10 Invade and steal the oil. Oil is the only reason we pick and choose which country to save.
4425 2018-09-27 16:00:09 Hey Chuck Grassley. We know your narrative. We've heard it a few times now. I think you've made your point. But keep drilling past oil.
4426 2018-09-27 16:00:07 India, Iran's second-biggest oil client behind China, has already reduced its intake of Iranian oil but has not yet decided whether to end purchases completely
In the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to trade with Iran.
Why pay more?

4431 2018-09-27 15:59:19 He is right, rate of every slabs used in electricity bill clearly mention in bill. No rate increase yet, fuel price adjustment added in each month bill purely based on international oil price
4432 2018-09-27 15:59:13 I always heard good things about head and shoulders. But if you have a dry scalp boil some fresh lemon juice and castor oil and massage it all over your roots and that will work Miracles

4440 2018-09-27 15:58:20 Pretty sure there was scarcity of products like medicines, toothpaste, and others well before oil prices went down, just on a smaller scale.
4441 2018-09-27 15:58:17 It is the right time to hit hard and take right decisions in favour of the country. We need dollies for essential imports only. Let us stop giving dollies for about all non essential items including oil. The world would have to follow us. Why at all we are not following trump.

4463 2018-09-27 15:55:47 Are you feeling guilty?
4464 2018-09-27 15:55:42 No the burning issue is OIL and Rupee - okay lets  go back to Rafale - at least we can blame  @MrsGandhi and Pakistan and Hollande for it.
4465 2018-09-27 15:55:24 Everythng like electicity was in the original creation plan, but God needed help on the ground to harness it.  Like the great supply of oil inside the earth's core.  Or the ocean full of the salt.  None of these things can just evolve randomly.  Has to be created.

4478 2018-09-27 15:54:23 At the dealership getting an oil change, ear-hustling on this commercial going on. Cracking up, listening to the DP direct this salesman, and the jokes being thrown. But, also dying over the fact that I cannot get away from it all, even while getting a daggone oil change.

4491 2018-09-27 15:52:45 Yes they pay the purchased oil with Indian rupee which means Iran has to spend the income to buy low quality goods " Junk" from India and Mr Zarriof will receive his cut.Same on you Zariof

And there's a price to be paid.

4500 2018-09-27 15:51:44 @realDonaldTrump we are the world's top producer of OIL and have been for several years.  How much of the 2M per day can we make up ourselves?
4501 2018-09-27 15:51:44 I didn’t think it was the 70’s. We experienced the oil embargo and gas shortages which limited driving.

4509 2018-09-27 15:51:04 Now that oil prices are on the up. What's the excuse of this govt.
4510 2018-09-27 15:50:58 Higher oil prices, higher interest rates, all-time high on stock valuations but inflation is under control...
4511 2018-09-27 15:50:56 OPEC's latest report released at the weekend forecast 
That its non-OPEC rivals led by the United States would increase output by 2.4 million bpd in 2019 while global oil demand should grow by just 1.5 million bpd. 

If this plays out, the current spike could be short lived.
4512 2018-09-27 15:50:56 Putting oil on it helps. Good luck
4513 2018-09-27 15:50:46 Oil man strapped up like Rambo 
4514 2018-09-27 15:50:40 Also, there is always dirty gas associated with oil: methane, but contaminated with other hydrocarbons and other impurities - for instance sulphur dioxide we know is present at Balcombe. It gets flared. Flares are very noisy, can be like jet engines. They also emit toxins.
4515 2018-09-27 15:50:28 I think they're cooked in sunflower oil (for your health!) and that pepper is what paprika comes from - the Capsicum annuum. That's my guess anyway.
4516 2018-09-27 15:50:08 I'm watching the livestream but I'm logging off the social medias for the day---if you see me on the internet doing anything that isn't related to public health or young gifted and broke douse me with lavender oil and tell me to get to work.
4517 2018-09-27 15:49:57 Im sitting in the lube shop getting my oil changed and I’ve over heard 3 white man now call this woman crazy, a liar, and having ulterior motives...I asked those men to elaborate their stance. They blew me off.
4518 2018-09-27 15:49:57 She smiled at you telling you its all yours. You now share your body and your stipends with the queen of your heart. You can't wait for uni to be over so you can get that work at the oil firm and marry her. 

But all she gave you was herpes, you played yourself.

4527 2018-09-27 15:49:00 Way to address the testimony. Figured you would spinelessly avoid it. Just keep deflecting and spinning. I guess this may be a good time to bring up Clinton or something from the past.
4528 2018-09-27 15:48:52 Ruin an 11:33AM morning? Someone has been burning the midnight oil 
4529 2018-09-27 15:48:44 @FarahPink face oil is really good my face felt so smooth this morning
4530 2018-09-27 15:48:44 Is there any truth in using products made Frm Palm Oil in the food industry eg cheeses etc hv bad health effects?
4531 2018-09-27 15:48:43 Mines ok. Lots of leaning on surfaces/my wheelchair. It’s harder though when I drop a bottle of oil on the floor like clumsy me did today!! #stupidMS
4532 2018-09-27 15:48:40 Morales engineered a change from neoliberal policies pursued by elite-led administrations, reasserted the role of the state in development, brought the oil industry into public control, land reform, introduced a constitution for indigenous rights & policies to combat poverty.
4533 2018-09-27 15:48:27 He opposed the Kinder Morgan oil pipeline in Massachusetts and stood with protesters. Kinder Morgan is worth $125B and is connected financially to many republican senators and lawmakers.
4534 2018-09-27 15:48:26 Get some carrot oil on they bad boys Johnny!
4535 2018-09-27 15:48:26 Oil s’agit bien d’une affaire qui date d’il y’a 38 ans ?
4536 2018-09-27 15:48:21 Dude the only spicy thing i could find in france was chili oil and i put it on 90% of my meals lol
4537 2018-09-27 15:48:20 To all of my friends,specifically in the 904 or any non-legal state for that matter:Be cautious of oil cartridges especially if it doesn't have any sort of packaging/labeling!! You never know what kind of chemical is in there. 
4538 2018-09-27 15:48:09 Why does everyone make fun of the way i say oil???
4539 2018-09-27 15:48:02 หมอบอก ห้ามนอนดึก
4540 2018-09-27 15:48:02 shout out to the album "Oil of Every Pearl's un-insides" by SOPHIE it slaps and she is impeccably talented
4541 2018-09-27 15:47:55 shampoo works well cause it works to take oil out of hair too. you put some on stain, rub it in, let it sit for 10-20 minutes then put it through washer
4542 2018-09-27 15:47:55 It's possible that the AUC could be effected but somehow it doesn't change LDL when lab tests are taken. (Not likely, but possible -- say the mineral oil created intra-day variability in LDL).
4543 2018-09-27 15:47:50 Venezuela is an economy dominated by oil and its international price , Corbyn’s policies are closer to a Scandi model . You know this but have to attack Corbyn ‘s appeal at every opportunity , starting to sound desperate
4544 2018-09-27 15:47:45 Also some of these money moves are to benefit his investments, ‘Trump offshore development’- oh and look at that he has an oil exec as Sec state, and relaxes emission standards.

It’s obvious.
4545 2018-09-27 15:47:41 I feel sorry for whoever gets my truck as a trade in one day....I SWEAR I done my best to get the oil changed every 5000 miles  don’t listen to that carfax report that shit is lying

4548 2018-09-27 15:47:33 May the blood be tainted, the tear gas fires within the car, the oil sprays on the street causing this car to crash.
4549 2018-09-27 15:47:28 Es llamativo el foco tanto de las empresas como del Gobierno y los inversores en el enorme potencial de desarrollo que ofrece #VacaMuerta para el sector de Oil&Gas en particular, así como también para múltiples sectores de la economía

4550 2018-09-27 15:47:22 Several ways: open a church in a good location... join politics...oil bunkering...etc etc
4551 2018-09-27 15:47:21 Not hard at all. Very easy just get 'enough margin and minimum percentage of vote per zone'. Loool
4552 2018-09-27 15:47:03 $LGCY company is profitable at these oil prices. Will pay off debt faster than originally thought.
4553 2018-09-27 15:47:01 Had to take it apart because of oil leaks almost all over the engine. But now I've put it back and I'm just doing some last stuff like putting all the small stuff back. Hopefully it will start again
4554 2018-09-27 15:47:01 In this Polarised World!

4561 2018-09-27 15:46:36 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
4562 2018-09-27 15:46:31 went to Walmart for an oil change and it was a 2 hour wait.. came to dons and went right in

4568 2018-09-27 15:45:52 @SebGorka The Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said he would like to see Google, Facebook and other major social media behemoths broken up like the federal government did to Standard Oil more than a century ago.
4569 2018-09-27 15:45:51 I made myself coffee at 7-11 and it taste like coconut oil and olive oil mixed together. 

How did I fuck up coffee that bad
4570 2018-09-27 15:45:44 My doctor always said not to use them. He said put a couple drops of mineral oil in your ears about 10 minutes before you shower.
4571 2018-09-27 15:45:40 “Whooo put the oil right hereee???” 
4572 2018-09-27 15:45:31 I don’t know if that’s good news for Iraq. I cant say for sure, but would the Ex finance & oil minister in a country that’s been called the most corrupt the best choice ?
4573 2018-09-27 15:45:25 Awful car uses a litre of oil a month and Vauxhall say it's within tolerance....well that's 25k I won't see again
4574 2018-09-27 15:45:23 Between these ads, all the investing and trading ads, and the snake oil DAD bod ads I have no idea whotwitter thinks I am. Smh.

4578 2018-09-27 15:45:01 Joe, I had an ideia of a new type of bullet for weapons. This bullet would be made of kraken oil, and you shoot it on a ship. If you hit the ship, then a track of black ink would show you a path to pursue the ship. It wouldn't show the exact position. What do you guys think?

4586 2018-09-27 15:44:23 Going for an oil change as a young women & the treatment from workers is actually so ridiculous it’s funny

4588 2018-09-27 15:44:10 I know what you want. Gusto nyo paggising nyo sa umaga mababa na ang presyo, right? But u know it doesn’t work that way. It takes time. Inflation? Hindi nya kontrolado lahat ng bagay like oil prices. NFA? Binalik nya sa under Agri na. May mga steps syang ginawa but it takes time.

4591 2018-09-27 15:43:49 I understand that, but it certainly looks like a prescient announcement given the traders saying $100 oil

4594 2018-09-27 15:43:29 Well we were cooking chicken and the oil got a little too hot and started smoking a lot and as to why i got sick i rly wish i had an answer i just felt nauseous when to get fresh air and. yea
4595 2018-09-27 15:43:16 Sharp guy!
Oil dey your brain. 
4596 2018-09-27 15:43:14 You can actually use the coconut oil cooking(!) spray. Four bucks.
4597 2018-09-27 15:43:08 It flowed 50 bopd before, without the tech and know how the oil industry has now. Also targeting the Kim zone which had not been fully tested with a lively horizontal. Anything in the hundreds of bopd would work at today’s oil prices compared to years back. IMHO
4598 2018-09-27 15:43:02 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot

4600 2018-09-27 15:43:01 Agreed. Oil is going to be difficult even with an SPV. But I also don't think it is the goal. Oil was literally a parenthetical in the SPV announcement.
4601 2018-09-27 15:43:00 Import in dollar must be restricted further. Only rupee based import should be allowed for gold and iran must be preferred partner for import of oil in indian rupee.
4602 2018-09-27 15:42:52 I love how my 3 month old grandland uses a litre of oil every month and thst Vauxhall say thst this is within tolerance
4603 2018-09-27 15:42:50 I have access to Pharmaceutical CBD oil for sale in large quantities. Let@me know if@your interested?

4615 2018-09-27 15:41:39 Yes it's definitely about the colour of the Skin, where the white one taking advantage of the black one, he wouldn't do that if a white person was working for him ask for oil in the wheelbarrow

4649 2018-09-27 15:38:40 Trying to contact Eric Andrew Miller, my precious grandson, born Eric Daniel Thompson, in Pendleton, OR November 27, 1991. He was working in Spokane at an oil change business but isn't there anymore. Help us out here, sleuths.
4650 2018-09-27 15:38:39 OPEC oil shipments will dip by 400k b/d to 25.01m b/d in the 4 weeks to Oct. 13 vs. period to Sept. 15,
4651 2018-09-27 15:38:34 18k is really low I agree but the govt simply can't afford to pay more right now. Financial report shows that oil revenues in 2017 could barely pay salaries. That's salary alone not even including govt projects.
Govt needs to find a way of increasing revenue first
4652 2018-09-27 15:38:33 For soup, cook sliced scallions in oil, then simmer with turkey, cilantro, beef broth and spinach. Top with mint.
4653 2018-09-27 15:38:16 Rice, bread, noodles, pasta, anything na may flour are carbs. Proteins are lean meat (poultry, pork, beef, fish), beans, egg (whites), nuts. Fat basically oil, taba, butter, margarine. Stay away from sugary food & drinks also, high caloric and less nutritional value.
4654 2018-09-27 15:38:14 Nope he just has oil income from family land with shale oil deposits below.  Oil shale is the first production to be cut as oil demand drops due to EV sales.
4655 2018-09-27 15:38:10 Doesn’t matter what people will be paying the price the quick to put the prices up but you never see them put in the prices down like oil prices when barrel goes up there quick to increase it when it goes down its all forgotten!!!!

4807 2018-09-27 15:24:15 Which is my allowed to happen because the oil industry uses your money to stop us from developing other resources. I work as a biologist for the transportation department for the county. The money is used to pave roads, build sidewalks for safety, include bike lanes,

4827 2018-09-27 15:23:06 Ideally capitalism is “aimed” at problems and innovation unleashed.  Vaccines worked like that.   Now we have the GOP who actually aimed capitalism at making the world a worse place.  I’ll never forgive the GOP for selling out to big oil.

4831 2018-09-27 15:22:55 Keep it up, Flav. An angle folks haven't focused on is the view that we have no leverage wrt #NAFTA 2.0. During 1.0 negs, secure oil supply from Canada was critical. That leverage is gone now, so disruption of highly integrated supply chains is key; but we're dealing w low IQ WH.

4848 2018-09-27 15:21:26 Actually, vote no on prob 6 because the oil industry has controlled us for long enough. We go to war over oil, technology is suspended, the environment is degraded.

4850 2018-09-27 15:21:19 "Enormous amounts of oil and gas under the ground. This is the wealth these companies are tapping, and climate change regulations mean they have to live these things in the ground." Dean Overpeck #WillG
4851 2018-09-27 15:21:17 There are tons of brands you can choose from, but it's best if you search something like, "CBD oil 1:20 (or more if you want, like 1:1) THC ratio." Then you can choose whatever product you think looks best!
4852 2018-09-27 15:21:14 Not a complete disaster! You need to coat it with a light film of vegetable oil & re-season it in a low oven (275 degrees) for 30-45 minutes. #CastIronQueen

4854 2018-09-27 15:21:12 I don't have acne but I do what's best for me and what my skin is used to. That is Vitamin E oil, Rose water, Dudu osun, Aztec clay, ACV and my facial brush.  Thats my routine. If I'm cleansing with any oil, its my olive oil.
4855 2018-09-27 15:20:45 1. I don't think that consumption of sugar in India is so much. Like FDA recommends to limit the daily added sugar intake to 12tsps to Americans. I just can't think of average Indians eating more than 3-4 tsps of added sugar per day
2. Don't Indians use ghee & coconut oil?....
4856 2018-09-27 15:20:33 Komal, the CPEC is a very tiny (not even exaggerating) part of the Belt and Road Initiative. China’s main stake in this was to make trading routes far more fluid; especially for oil. Saudi Arabia’s involvement was inevitable.
4857 2018-09-27 15:20:23 Actually, it was high oil prices that wrecked the economy in the '70s, and low oil prices that restored it in the '80s.
4858 2018-09-27 15:20:21 Yes, in The Big Fat Surprise, Teicholz tells how the fictional diet was built was based on Italy junkets for academics in the early 90s, financed by the olive oil industry. Insane that olive oil - which we've consumed in bulk for only 150 years - is the only "safe, healthy" fat.
4859 2018-09-27 15:20:18 @BeckyQuick @JoeSquawk Re: fish oil the other day - My doc tipped me off to storing it in the freezer to prevent it coming up. It has worked for me.

4867 2018-09-27 15:19:25 But you’ve (assumedly) admitted, repented, and reconciled with your past. World of difference from someone categorically denying he was an angry, lust-fueled drunk (assuming the accusations are true). It’s not the crimes of youth. It’s refusing to make up for them.
4868 2018-09-27 15:19:21 If Trump intervenes Venezuela, he will have a great rich ally that will provide the USA with free oil in pay for giving us our freedom back from this narcotics criminals dictatorship.

4878 2018-09-27 15:18:33 On @channelafrica1: The son of Angola’s former president has been remanded in custody in a $1,5 billion corruption case. Last year, President Joao Lourenco also dismissed the former president’s daughter as chair of state oil company, Sonangol. #SABCNews
4879 2018-09-27 15:18:24 I see. You have enough pool for yourself and no one else deserves any. Does that summarize your statement? If not, where should oil come from to supply the increased demand for the next few decades?

4884 2018-09-27 15:18:11 According to Eurostat, the European Union's main statistics agency, Russia is the source of 25% to 50% of Germany's oil imports and 50% to 75% of its gas imports.

20% of total energy.

No reliance there........

4920 2018-09-27 15:14:06 Sadly in this case it’s not that they didn’t know it had sesame oil in it, it’s simply that it wasn’t labelled. UK law requires the information to be available, but no necessarily on the packaging. Apparently they have a booklet they can give you to read that says it if you ask >
4921 2018-09-27 15:13:56 I agree with you. 

We never have to dump oil to make repairs.  

Obviously our industry is run by people so accidents the do happen.  I'm proud of our extensive reporting and transparency so everyone learns from them.

4952 2018-09-27 15:11:11 yes. you forever should be judged by your mistakes. there is no reform.
4953 2018-09-27 15:10:57 I know , I been seeing your tweets . And did you try that food and I never got an oil change
4954 2018-09-27 15:10:54 you'll have to find someone else then: I basically only share stuff like oil, salt, spices. Eggs, milk, flour etc on a case-by-case basis (like, if they ran out of eggs they can have some of mine, but I'll take 2 back when they restock).

4956 2018-09-27 15:10:51 I always ask the "Russia Russia RUSSIA!" crowd what they think of much more blatant cases of foreign interference, like Saudi Arabia slashing oil prices to help Dubya in 2004. Or the October Surprises in 1968 and 1980. The answer?

Crickets. Very quiet crickets.
4957 2018-09-27 15:10:50 At one point the shittiest driver in the series, Maldonado, was bringing in the most money to Williams through PDVSA, Venezuela's own corrupt oil firm. Racing costs money and money brings power and too often corruption. F1 doesn't care.

4995 2018-09-27 15:07:13 I think one of the most under-hyped things about electric cars is that they require MUCH less maintenance than their gas counterparts. No oil changes! No belts that wear out!

5084 2018-09-27 15:00:00 Eh, dont think you can blame trump in this one, OPEC wont pump more. At the same time this does help the US with all shale oil we have.

5095 2018-09-27 14:59:04 @Herbworthy #Askherb 
How much to CBD oil should I give my dogs calm them down? Jack Russell and Chihuahua maybe 10lbs at the most.
5096 2018-09-27 14:58:49 The EU has fuck all to do with the price of oil. The EU buys oil mainly off Russia and the Middle East. The reason it’s rising is because Donald trump keeps pissing Iran off so they are lowering the oil production hence the price increase.

5098 2018-09-27 14:58:37 A blind man could see this coming.

Now its time to pay the piper while it is still new .

5103 2018-09-27 14:58:10 I think time it is for real. Mexico's light crude oil output is at record low, and with water invading Pemex's Xanab shallow water field, the state company don't have any more options than importing the light crude oil to feed Salina Cruz

5114 2018-09-27 14:57:25 We're unlikely to steal your technology and sell it on the market too. I do hope Putin does keep it this way,not many nations will buy potentially $10 billion dollars of arms and invest in Russian oil fields.Unfortunately reads on indo-Russian affairs is very sentimental here
5115 2018-09-27 14:57:23 Aye a lot of ppl r getting fucked over bc of the oil situation-Aberdeen is expensive for what it is likes,I rented a 4 bed house with sunroom etc private front&back garden in Arbroath for £400 a month,its a lot cheaper in places like Angus but  not many jobs so swings&roundabouts

5117 2018-09-27 14:57:15 I don’t think harmful is the word I would use so much as untrue. I have never seen that practice of using this oil alone hurt anyone and don’t claim so. My point is that it is based on a false narrative of how the universe works.

5139 2018-09-27 14:53:58 Oil and Dirty Computer's positions, at the very least, should be flipped IMO (I love both but I think SOPHIE expressed what she wanted to as clearly and concise as possible without sacrificing quality, which I'm not sure I can 100% say about Janelle)

5143 2018-09-27 14:53:18 Ford has evidence.  She just admitted that she brought up her alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh because of her front door remodeling job.  

I’m going claim that Maxine Waters sexually assaulted me the next time I get an oil change.
5144 2018-09-27 14:53:06 Confused as to what this is, but I’ll add the oil to the flame
5145 2018-09-27 14:53:03 Agree. Govrn will continue extending the deadline as we are now in high oil price period. Will BP or Shell interested? Good news as I am optimistic farm out will happen. #clnr

5149 2018-09-27 14:52:43 Sitting in Econ and the girl in front of me is all “I had to go in and see what the light meant in my car. Apparently I have to change my oil ”  do you not keep track of your mileage? Also how do you not know what that light means 
5150 2018-09-27 14:52:38 I’m very fortunate that I have never tore a ligament or broke a bone. Cuz I know damn well if I did my African parents wouldn't have spent a cent on getting it fixed. All my moms would do is just ask me to go upstairs and grab the anointing oil so she could pray on it. Smh

5156 2018-09-27 14:51:49 No sorry, I'm just trying to say that we should judge a person by the sum total of good and bad they do over their lifetime. There's no starting over, ever.

5198 2018-09-27 14:46:36 Reality is we need oil. Stop. The tankers are there already coming south from Alaska in the same waters without the extra protections the TMP tankers would have (tugs attached, local pilots) we have the risk but no profit to pay for services to our most vulnerable. Shame.

5244 2018-09-27 14:41:30 Doesn’t the 30 tell where the oil must fall within the viscosity limits at 100%
5245 2018-09-27 14:41:30 Can you take it off? The oil is burning my finger

5257 2018-09-27 14:39:48 Thank you Helen for exposing these leftist liars for what they are. Word manipulaters. Read negative words in, like in your case, and distort the truth of what you said to destroy you or do the same positively to save Ramaphosa. Snake oil salesmen i tell you.
5258 2018-09-27 14:39:42 Is there a good life hack to turn these spring rolls in the pan without splashing the frying oil everywhere?
5259 2018-09-27 14:39:42 It's absolutely stupid to make oneself dependent on Trump for oil and natural gas. Especially when you have your own. And especially while he is trying to destroy Quebec farmers. 

70% of Quebecers are smart about this point according to our polls
5260 2018-09-27 14:39:37 that's a myth , oil was already nationalized by that time and mossadeq kept overdoing!
iran did not have the capability of running the industries , what mossaddegh did was ripping the oil contracts with anglo-persian oil company one siddedly ,then the british sued iran they won
5261 2018-09-27 14:39:32 Coal, immediately that is, only affects poor areas. They're not mining coal near any rich folk and he doesn't look at things like long term environmental and health effects. So he's going to keep pushing oil and coal.
5262 2018-09-27 14:39:22 Looking at this appointment reminder like . Why did I schedule my oil change early af Saturday .. listening to ddt
5263 2018-09-27 14:39:22 Your nausea inducing ‘News Conference’ was a total con job by a professional blow hard snake oil salesmen that’s so far out of his league he doesn’t even know where he’s going or what he’s doing. All that seems to matter is that YOU look good. How about us!?
5264 2018-09-27 14:39:19 We need a popular vote that temporarily inacts term limits whenever Congress locks up. We can call it the oil change act.

5278 2018-09-27 14:38:06 It was another mini Napoleon, Sarkozy, who broke international law by bombing and throwing a sovereign country, Libya, into chaos. Oil for them, migrants for us; this is the French humanitarian principle. It is grotesque as well as offensive that they should show us morals.
5279 2018-09-27 14:38:00 If there is no agreement on oil & natural gas then that part is not included. The basic issue with the previous NEP it was headed by a Quebecois threatened by the economic power of Alberta, and Quebec and Ontario losing their relative power position in the confederation.
5280 2018-09-27 14:37:57 Trudeau should be a man and shut off the imports of Saudi oil.
5281 2018-09-27 14:37:57 Here is what International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated is oil price breakeven point for GCC countries to stay in surplus: Bahrain -$113, 
Saudi Arabia - $87.9 
Oman - $77.1  
United Arab Emirates $71.5, 
Kuwait - $48.1  
Qatar - $47.1

5283 2018-09-27 14:37:53 Where do we stand in the Russian worldview. Our interests align more with the west nowadays,but even the most pro-western leader we have,modi. Just refuses to abandon Moscow. Rosneft last year entered our oil retail market too,3rd largest and fastest growing in the world fyi.
5284 2018-09-27 14:37:47 Waiting around for my oil change to be done and they have the Kavanaugh hearings on TV.......it blows me that these have to happen like why can't people respect boundaries and NOT ASSAULT EACH OTHER
5285 2018-09-27 14:37:44 
5286 2018-09-27 14:37:43 You can't be serious about this.....so where you start determines the level at which you can finish?    Wake up, you are what your actions say you are, a lifetime of good will never make up for a terrible act, but you are not the act, you are the good because of the bad

5289 2018-09-27 14:37:25 You go and tell that to people who have been put out of their jobs in the oil and gas sector and who are desperate to go back in. You’re asking the wrong question to the wrong guy.
5290 2018-09-27 14:37:23 And what happens the next time oil crashes, because it will.  It always does.  We need to diversify our economy and find other ways to generate government revenue than oil royalties.  Maybe it's time for a PST

5321 2018-09-27 14:33:43 Yea it usually is.  The new US ambassador is an idiot.  She's a Trump loving oil tycoon that doesn't believe in climate change 
5322 2018-09-27 14:33:41 Solar tech is greener than oil but not that green. To build solar panels you pollute quite a lot and their efficiency is very low ( so you need to make many ) they have a life cycle of 20 years and aren’t easily disposable
5323 2018-09-27 14:33:33 If everyone was so wise what was the need for @seriousfunnyguy to take this initiative. Now your argument is about government revenue and my worry is about the battle of perception. GOI needs to reduce oil prices if it does not have anything bigger to bring before 2019.
5324 2018-09-27 14:33:30 And with the price of fuel rising & I don’t mean just petrol (I’ve paid £550 for 1000 litres of oil to heat my house will probably be lucky if that lasts till end January hoping we don’t have snow like earlier this year) & the general day to day living costs rising its no easier!

5341 2018-09-27 14:32:01 Exactly, instead of working with countries, they rally together against his policies. No clue about diplomacy. And the price of oil will continue to rise. And guess who pays for that? Oh yeah, you and I.

Why cant you explain why westminster wants to keep scots then?

5373 2018-09-27 14:28:55 If only there were some way to reduce our need for oil and other fossil fuels. You know, #RenewableEnergy sources like wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, #EVs, etc. And batteries and the like for storing excess generated energy for later consumption.

5506 2018-09-27 14:15:51 Most olive oil is partially rancid. Also, it is not stable at warm temps so given how people typically handle OO (keeping it over or near the warm stove for instance) it isn't the best choice for cooking. Lard is better. It cooks at a higher temp and is shelf stable longer.

5511 2018-09-27 14:14:44 it would be weird to get an oil change if you planned to ram into a crowd of people in the next few days. in fact i would say getting one is demonstrative that you do not plan to do that. now do you take competitor's coupons?
5512 2018-09-27 14:14:37 I don't know if I'd do it, but lurpark butter is made from only natural ingredients and the rapeseed oil gives it a unique finish that's better than its many imitators.  I wouldn't leave home with it.
5513 2018-09-27 14:14:30 London yes, DC is soaked in dollars from SA.

Trump approved XL which will entrench the US as the only customer for our oil & gas.  

While at the same time Trump strengthens the US as Quebec's preferred supplier  of oil & gas.

5547 2018-09-27 14:11:58 The Canadian economy is resource-based… Mining, logging, fishing, farming, oil & gas, ranching…etc.  
Also, don’t forget that the city of Vancouver actually sits in a location that was a rain forest… Until they clear cut, paved and built a city. What’s next, stop everything?

5551 2018-09-27 14:11:38 We understand in mfg that a marketing plan built on production requiring an offshore supply chain carry’s a risk. Just ask BP with their oil plants in Venezuela. We need a domestic steel supply chain in the USA and the tariffs were necessary.

5568 2018-09-27 14:08:59 Basically using shitty environment killing liquids to drill through hard rock into the earth to get oil and natural gas. It fucks up our crust and nothing good ever comes from it. Obama kept it back and now every old fuck is pushing for it to make money

5574 2018-09-27 14:08:22 Ok, let me translated it for you, crude oil prices are determined by the international market. If the demand goes up and the $ appreciates then the per gallon price will go up which the end user eventually have to pay.  Hope this helps where I was going.

5583 2018-09-27 14:07:12 On the flip side, it appears FAAC is no longer really an oil story.

NNPC is just the bad boy who gets all the headlines. But its clear FIRS & Customs are the ones doing the really heavy lifting.

So we might just have to dead the narrative about FG revenues not being diversified

5651 2018-09-27 13:58:26 Gonna try out CBD oil on the dog to see does it help his arthritis and anxiety.
5652 2018-09-27 13:58:22 This scientist if trying to find other ways to find helium so he stated, “We’re essentially replicating the strategy for exploring for oil and gas for helium,” said Jonathan Gluyas, a professor of geoenergy at the Durham University in England.
5653 2018-09-27 13:58:14 I have some questions. Including "highly purified," "industrial strength," costs, and this vs the coffin given to fish oil supplements a month or two ago.
5654 2018-09-27 13:58:02 It’s the finalisation of the corporate takeover of American politics. Trump is a dancing clown in front of a thousand oil rigs.
5655 2018-09-27 13:57:25 This doesn't make sense. Guyana is not in need of a financial bailout like Argentina. the IMF does not invest in oil projects
5656 2018-09-27 13:57:24 Early reviews from certain segments of oil industry is they don't like it. They will fight the restrictions, and could ultimately sour the WH announcement unless Trump ignores their protests.
5657 2018-09-27 13:57:00 OpenTable is looking to leverage its scale and experience in restaurants to become a data-fueled recommendation engine for diners and a source of quality intelligence for restaurant operators.

They work with 47k restaurants + seat 26 mn diners per month.

Big Data > Big Oil
5658 2018-09-27 13:56:58 Im pretty sure it’s common but I think coconut oil and I are no longer compatible.
5659 2018-09-27 13:56:54 “Dear Candidate,

We wish to use this medium to inform you that you are needed as an expatriate in the on-going oil/gas exploration in Qatar.”

5661 2018-09-27 13:56:47 It's easy put palm oil on the fire and heat it for a whilst aka 'bleaching' ... then add dried fish, half an onion and salt, maggi all those things to set the scene. Buy ground egusi, mix with water into a paste then add to the oil. Wash and slice in some spinach. All in 20 mins
5662 2018-09-27 13:56:41 I refuse to try the castor oil.
5663 2018-09-27 13:56:33 What type are you?
Oily, dry, combination?
We offer oil/filter change on all vehicles, call us for a price now!
5664 2018-09-27 13:56:24 The restrictions include position limits on 120 percent of parties annual obligation. This is aimed squarely at oil companies with retail arms. A second measure under consideration would restrict certain parties from holding on to credits for more than 30 days.
5665 2018-09-27 13:56:20 You shouldn’t take corrections as a sign of criticism...having a bunch of Dads Army photographers trying to be oil experts is quite laughable....just be honest ....they are using photos to influence the SP to make a quick buck. I applaud them for that
5666 2018-09-27 13:56:17 exactly. We all did stupid stuff as teens. I have grown up tremendously.
5667 2018-09-27 13:55:58 I could barely differentiate one from the other but I can vividly recall that it was fried with red oil and well-seasoned.
5668 2018-09-27 13:55:54 Iran was going to nationalize their own #oil that is why CIA n America's name, destroyed their Democracy~

5677 2018-09-27 13:54:43 And not entirely out of place the consequences of Nigeria's minimum wage increase done just before the last administration left the office - LCY conundrum and heaven helps you if oil prices go down just as you tick higher wages.
5678 2018-09-27 13:54:28 billionaires who love the status quo and oil etc. As Jimmy acts like the real deal freedom fighter. yeah right.. NO media outlet of any kind really wants to talk about what really happened at Standing Rock I know Jimmy the man with integrity is one of them.

5682 2018-09-27 13:53:34 Having pins in my hand has severely limited the amount of exercise I can participate in. Now I just shake violently to relieve energy & burn calories, exactly like an oil rig
5683 2018-09-27 13:53:31 I thought it was some cracker of a picture coming then.
Like Uncle Stephen driving a tanker out.

5699 2018-09-27 13:51:29 I swear by Kiss my Face brand olive oil soap. It's like 5 dollars for a bar and it lasts for months! Moisturizers are harder to recommend because everyone's skin responds differently. From what I've heard if you're in ur 30s it's time to start using a product w retinol in it
5700 2018-09-27 13:51:21 This is a travesty, @AmericanAir. The painting is oil pastel - it has shards stuck to it and scratches all across the surface.
5701 2018-09-27 13:51:17 Love how my old girl didn’t do much of my CBD oil when I offered her to try it because she though it would get her high 
5702 2018-09-27 13:50:43 Oboma is not our president.
The nitwit you claim as president has set race relations back fifty years, destroyed the US coal and oil industry, armed the IRS, allowed the deep state to spy on a presidential candidate, maligned Americas police, and is now interfering in elections.

5705 2018-09-27 13:50:16 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
5706 2018-09-27 13:50:03 I really love Butternut Squash ravioli in the fall. The squash is in season and make a wonderfully tasty meal. You can go either sweet or savory with the sauce you put on, or you just drizzle them with olive oil and sea salt and eat as is! Either way it's great 
5707 2018-09-27 13:49:56 And Norwegian government has all that subsidy money because..... Oil.
5708 2018-09-27 13:49:54 It is somewhat concerning and ominous for the domestic Oil patch that the services Co’s are trading so poorly. $SLCA $SLB (Best in respective service) grinding lower as Oil prices increased all year. Not good!

5715 2018-09-27 13:49:01 Indeed. But I'd rather see it change as a result of technology - or shrink as a result of it's slavery to oil - instead of collapsing due to suicidal economic policy.
5716 2018-09-27 13:49:00 I’m not going to bed before 10 any more. Fall asleep early it is dry as hell wake up to get an oil change and i had to build fucking Noah’s ark!!! 
5717 2018-09-27 13:48:48 I take your point, but I guess it's all relative and I am comparing her to her counterparts in other parties, who may be as slick as oil, but I know who I would trust.
5718 2018-09-27 13:48:48 Thought it was the destruction of the western banking systems ?  Gaddafi & Husain wanted to get rid of the dollars oil market in favour of gold for oil . Syria not a threat anymore , dose Iran have  the weapons !   . Did Husain hide  them in Iran . ? But you found lots of gold
5719 2018-09-27 13:48:40 Me!  I'm ready. Kicked it up at the gym before sun-up. Oil change done. Call into slow #StateFarm and pecking away at the computer. You guys? What's hot?

5727 2018-09-27 13:47:49 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Transmountain = enriching #LGBTQ killing dictators.
5728 2018-09-27 13:47:48 No more than you can reduce GHG emissions by increasing GHG emissions via oil sands.
5729 2018-09-27 13:47:34 We only release from SPR when prices are low and the world is awash in oil.

5747 2018-09-27 13:45:28 Let's face it, the EU is powerless to do anything about Russia. Expel a few more diplomats perhaps?  You will still buy Putin's oil and send him congratulations when he 'wins' the next presidential election. You like to talk a lot, but never have the solution.

5750 2018-09-27 13:45:16 Plastic is an abomination, how would your favorite takeout place be different without plastic forks? Oil is so useful it makes amazing things necessary. Mowing lawns, flying cross country for a one hour meeting, hauling tons of garbage a hundred miles every day.

5765 2018-09-27 13:44:09 40 years ago, in a freshman college paper written to answer where is the most important region of the future, I predicted this region. Twas obvious given the oil richness of Azerbaijan and its border with Iran. Looks like Russia is winning the game of Risk
5766 2018-09-27 13:43:57 It has recently been released that 25 orangutans die a day. 

In the last 20 years Indonesia & Malaysia have reported a 80% habitat loss. 

This is due to palm oil plantations being developed. 

Palm oil is DEADLY to orangutans please consider stopping funding it & it’s cruelty.

5775 2018-09-27 13:43:18 She never said she'd be interviewed by the FBI. Avenatti is the only one talking right now and no one can believe a word that snake oil salesman says. He's not even answering basic questions like when she contacted him and why she kept attending these parties.
5776 2018-09-27 13:43:16 The world is funny. If the government finds 'diamonds' or 'oil' in your backward, it's government property. But if they find 'drugs', it's yours.

5794 2018-09-27 13:41:09 And define grandstanding.  For every pipeline we stop, we slow the growth of the tar sands.  And don't tell me it will go by rail anyway, because oil transport by rail is very slow to grow.
5795 2018-09-27 13:41:09 I tend to believe the oil companies can comply with the regulations and not ruin the state's economy as they claim.

5839 2018-09-27 13:37:51 Am not being funny but I had my MOT done a month ago and there were no faults apart from the light. Took it back to get it changed today and suddenly I need a new battery, I have contaminated antifreeze and need a new oil sensor thing. Do I fuck.
5840 2018-09-27 13:37:49 Tough nut to crack? hahahaa >> They're a committeed lot man > It's easy to change a running engine oil than try and change their minds. You may have fished out some confused ones in the crowd or they simply ignored you for your moronery <
5841 2018-09-27 13:37:48 Yes: in supermarkets. It will be funny to see how easy it will be to find vegan food in supermarkets---except maybe standard, non-fancy vegetables---after we have finished oil and have to renounce our fast transportation network.

Also, why did you skip the "expensive" part"?

5847 2018-09-27 13:37:28 How anyone could believe Sir Ian Wood was neutral in the 2014 referendum was just beyond me. The SNP at that time gave him credence as they themselves had so little knowledge of the Scottish Oil and Gas sector. Wood is and always was a BRITISH UNIONIST.

Spearmint tea pulak sebab I tak suka rasa dia 
5851 2018-09-27 13:37:18 hey but 'we' just struck oil west of Shetland right? Right?! 
5852 2018-09-27 13:37:12 So @audicanada thinks a steering rack should be replaced as frequently as an oil change.  I asked them why it failed so often and they don't know.  They sure command a lot of money for their product only to provide an inferior product.  I'm $7000 in the hole in 4 years.

(2/2)   major crude exporter Iran come  into force in five weeks. Opec did not indicate any plan to increase  output at its meeting last Sunday, which is causing oil prices spiral  up.
5856 2018-09-27 13:36:46 Agreed. The GOP threw all that balanced budget stuff out the window. They sold us out to pay back their donors with that tax break giveaway! I'm angry. We're giving away $1.5 trillion so they can thank their sponsors! Here in PA, the GOP blocks us from taxing the oil companies
5857 2018-09-27 13:36:40 Crude oil on the boil

Tight supply ahead of US sanctions on Iran kept the oil market boiling. A Reuters report said crude oil prices rose nearly 1 per cent on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supplies once US sanctions against major crude  (1/2)
5858 2018-09-27 13:36:35 Why, in your view, do we have such a high #YYC downtown vacancy rate?  Yeah, oil prices are down but rents are next to nothing?  What is holding things back in Ward 7?  How do #YYC’s business tax rates compare to those YYC competes with to attract those businesses?

5862 2018-09-27 13:35:55 Oil and Gas has a 4-8 economic multiplier effect compared to less than 2 for wind or solar, pays a disproportionate share of its revenues in taxes, compared to taxpayers paying TO wind and solar, and is, by far, the highest paying industry across the educational spectrum. #NoBeto

5882 2018-09-27 13:34:33 Wrong again.  Oil and gas is a perpetual generator of high paying jobs.  Unlike you I work in the industry right now.  I see it first hand.  After the IBEW members install a solar farm they hire min wage ppl to cut weeds and clean panels.  O&G hire ppl at nearly 100k per year

5888 2018-09-27 13:33:47 I hate getting oil changes.
5889 2018-09-27 13:33:32 No, it's the fact that many women can change their own oil. Many men do not wear Spanx. Changing your oil is not a "man" thing. Wearing Spanx is more a "woman" thing. 

The obvious is that men have anatomy that women do not. So making the women experience that.

5892 2018-09-27 13:33:14 That was a good move... did it also have something to do with the oil prices that went down? If Doug could handle the oil cartels monopoly that would mean something... even south of the boarder they are pay quite a bit less for their gas #gas #oilandgas

5918 2018-09-27 13:29:38 Who is the terrible Nigerian that started the rumour that Wizkid and Davido both have oil wells? Because my classmates from Rwanda feel I'm not up to date and I'm telling them that these are all lies.

5923 2018-09-27 13:29:09 It is the law. Obey it. It does not serve one it is for the good of all people. Let the oil companies use all the lawsuit money to find new sources of energy.

5927 2018-09-27 13:28:02 It's not a debate.  We have to stop new pipelines and eliminate oil by rail.  It's not either-or, it's neither.
5928 2018-09-27 13:27:51 The world’s first rocket and space technology to produce fuel by using fuel oil residues from refineries offered by Anatoly Papusha, the Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences who developed the Buran program. #Papusha #Token #ETH

5930 2018-09-27 13:27:44 Africa has given a lot to the slavers, to the colonialists, to the miners, dealers in oil. It has given all there is and is now giving to the Chinese. Perhaps when it is all gone we will be left alone but know that when the heavens fall, it won’t be on one persons head.
5931 2018-09-27 13:27:42 Two things, impunity and mediocrity. We just do shabby things from crappy ideas with zero zeal for excellence. What's stops the IOCs. exploring/producing oil for decades from building/operating refineries in Nigeria. Economics or politics?

Feb - 647 Bn
Mar - 627 Bn
Apr - 701 Bn
May - 669 Bn 
Jun - 822 Bn
Jul - 715 Bn
Aug - 742 Bn 

They fought over February, March & May revenues. Oil prices up 22% YTD. Seems like 700 Bn is the lucky number. Anything below that, na war.
5934 2018-09-27 13:27:24 They have been saying the oil is gone  since I was in primary school, 40yrs ago at least 
5935 2018-09-27 13:27:21 man its prolly Chex mix in that oil at this point
5936 2018-09-27 13:27:20 the weird thing with increasing fuel prices in south africa is even if OPEC increase their oil productions we will still pay more 4 fuel, during OPEC's darkest times we were still getting rediculous fuel increases,our law makers are failing us. Weak Rand is just making it worse.
5937 2018-09-27 13:27:20 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.

5943 2018-09-27 13:26:29 The chronology of the Iran deal and unravelling goes hand in hand with high/low price of oil, Obama vs Trump. Cooperation it the future - yes, better to first get in as powerful position as possible to be able to negotiate from that position.

I don't understand your point it was in fact higher under Obama, Obama did not control the oil prices then and Trump doesn't control them now

5958 2018-09-27 13:25:07 @Ritzcrackers, @Colgate and @Dove, please stop buying palm oil from @wilmarintern. It's unsustainable destruction of our rain forests.

5961 2018-09-27 13:24:54 Notice how the transfer increased massively since 2015 as oil revenues collapsed. Since you support independence will you lend your support to the Orkneys and Shetlands Independence Campaign?  They’ll be very well off if they went independent.

5976 2018-09-27 13:22:25 Well isn't that what Gas peakers are supposed to do? Coal plants are already next to the mines and metal tanks are already there with oil, though from what I read, storage costs are about 10$ per barrel per year.
5977 2018-09-27 13:22:17 Ah yes...there’s no information more trustworthy than that of an Instagram post from a girl who went to cosmetology school to tell me about how oil is a good thing

5996 2018-09-27 13:20:17 Trump mentioned that yesterday. I thought we were worlds top oil producers now?
5997 2018-09-27 13:20:11 Apparently we had a great deal of protectionism in 2015 as trade came down to much lower levels than today?  10% tariffs on $200b between two economies worth $35 trillion,  price of oil ,  wages, inflation,   interest rates etc. have far more impact.

Edible coconut oil is the best. The purer the better but even a cheap one helps. Keep it away from sunlight though.
6002 2018-09-27 13:19:46 By “entitlements,” do you mean the corporate dole handed out by the country to the oil industry and agribusinesses or the tax breaks for people buying yachts and registering them in the Cayman Islands?

I feel like this is very simple.
6011 2018-09-27 13:18:54 He denied these pernicious charges because they are false.  So obviously false.  But, I suppose you believe the fact that Ford is represented by the same firm that handled Swetnicks lawsuit 10 years ago is just a coincidence?

6017 2018-09-27 13:18:31 Thanks for replying but if you watch the movie you will see the RSPO is a sham and green washing. There are plenty of sustainable alternatives to palm oil. I hope you will consider shifting to one of these.

6059 2018-09-27 13:13:09 Gnome Tip: A light oil, such as WD-40 will remove pitch (and road tar) without damaging the paint. Be sure to use a light cotton cloth and wipe in a circular motion. 
6060 2018-09-27 13:12:48 If there were 400,000 jobs in the "Green industry" up for grabs and profits to be made and a ready market, don't people think the money men would have been all over it, just more snake oil salesman bullshit from Corbyn and #Labour, just State subsidised non jobs
6061 2018-09-27 13:12:43 Russia or the US wouldn’t benefit from a pipeline in Syria. Russia wants Nordstream pipeline to Europe. US oil/gas can be delivered by shipping, if it needs the stuff

6068 2018-09-27 13:12:06 more trade is what's required! not tariffs... (china, oil, farming product, LNG etc) whatever the US can sell - if he continues that way , it'll get worse for US eventually....particularly if $ stays firm, let alone firmer - ford 1bn$ cost on steel due to tariffs etc etc
6069 2018-09-27 13:11:57 looks good but you should also be taking at least 5000iu vitamin D daily, 3000mg fish  oil, 600mg magnesium, zinc (make sure your zinc:copper ratio are ok),  ashwagandha for anxiety. if you plan on drinking coffee make sure to  supplement that with at least 200mg of L-Theanine

6072 2018-09-27 13:11:48 Well stated !  If it wasn’t for the oil companies running the country there is no need for war!   Their wealth depends on price and supply!  They do both by keeping the wars going!  All for the purpose of U$ interests is the excuse?
6073 2018-09-27 13:11:41 I have a Q for @jimcramer re Iran Sanctions, What will happen if the World calls Trump's bluff? @squawkstreet Consider, Trump imposes sanctions on Iranian Oil, What will he do to China or Russia if they buy Iranian Oil? Oil is fungible after all @cnbc

6082 2018-09-27 13:10:24 The borrowing from China is a separate issue. As I said, Chavez had the country in a mess before the oil price drop and was borrowing from China to cover his overspend.
6083 2018-09-27 13:10:21 #Ayurvedic Tip: Try oil pulling.
Ayurvedic experts recommend oil pulling (gently swishing your mouth with oil) each morning before brushing as part of the ideal #dinacharya, or Ayurvedic morning routine. Oil pulling helps remove toxins from your entire mouth and soothes the gums.

6096 2018-09-27 13:09:19 Yep. Prof. Ford has clearly not changed since a terrible youth.
6097 2018-09-27 13:09:14 Where UK foreign policy concerned, as with these Skripal allegations against Russia, is vital to know that those trying to claim "proof" from dubious photos have the interests of UK in mind & not those of foreign powers bent on crippling Russia to grab Syria/Iran land/oil.
6098 2018-09-27 13:09:12 I need to get a oil change this weekend, I usually stay on top of it.

6117 2018-09-27 13:07:13 It goes beyond location.

The private (Catholic) vs public school rivalry was a thing back then (I went to both.)
And it's a thing now (I have teenagers).

It's like oil and water - there are lots of resentments/mistrust in both directions - w/ rare exceptions, they don't mix.
6118 2018-09-27 13:07:03 There are angels on this earth. They make oil and risk their freedom to help sick people. May God bless and protect them.  Amen.

6128 2018-09-27 13:06:15 Usually great takes but the entire military industrial complex and US power structure relies on securing and controlling oil supply around the world.

6131 2018-09-27 13:06:05 Important to note that only Epidiolex is rescheduled, not CBD.  We can debate the 'why' but the bottom-line is that 'full-spectrum hemp oil,' for all intents and purposes, is the new #CBD as it pertains to claims and labels, as we've discussed.

6189 2018-09-27 13:01:16 Our economy has never been competitive - industries have also been weak productively because of years of infrastructure neglect and inexistent data, not to forget other microeconomic competitiveness issues. Free oil money and lack of public accountability worsened issues
6190 2018-09-27 13:01:06 Top Finance Ministry official on crude price, says, we are not worried and our economy will sustain. Our growth rate will be robust. We are reducing oil our consumption.

6192 2018-09-27 13:00:53 Did you know that hemp was one of the earliest agricultural crops? The plant was cultivated for fiber and the seeds were used to make food and oil. Archeological evidence shows that #hemp was used to make different textiles, ropes and paper.

6258 2018-09-27 12:54:27 US Energy Secretary Rick Perry ruled out releasing oil from the country’s strategic stockpiles to prevent an oil price spike due to the growing loss of Iranian barrels
from the market.
6259 2018-09-27 12:54:19 It's sickening watching Trump criticising Iran for sowing chaos when he doesn't believe in climate change, when he's expanding drilling for oil, when (along with the UK) he's helping Saudi Arabia destroy Yemen, and when he's trying to make more nukes.

Trump's scarier than Iran.
6260 2018-09-27 12:54:17 Trump was expected to work on the world price of oil that is hampering the progress of the world and especially the poorest countries.
6261 2018-09-27 12:54:12 Thx. What about the comments that countries will buy oil from countries closer to them simply because of cost? Ergo it’s a fallacy to believe India or China would buy from .

More likely it can’t be invaded as it’s not upsetting the US (much), it buys military equipment, allows western oil companies in, and supplies lots of oil

6350 2018-09-27 12:44:08 Hot oil??? That... seems like it would hurt a lot.
6351 2018-09-27 12:43:59 Depends on what method you’re employing. Deep frying (potato chip for example) will require you to use the depth of the oil but when you’re not using deep frying, the width of the pan is the way to go

6355 2018-09-27 12:43:45 In 2014, some of the majors weren't making money at $100 oil.  Since then, costs have fallen a lot. Now $80 Brent is more than enough for these co's to re-engage their capex programs.  Plugging a 3-5 yr 10-15% CAGR top-line into WFT, SLB, HAL, BHGE yields some surprising results

6363 2018-09-27 12:42:56 I really consider both. If the frying pan is big enough & the oil is of enough quantity, I'd put a larger number, if otherwise, I'd put according to the quantity of the oil.

6458 2018-09-27 12:33:12 If I may suggest going to WF or Trader Joe’s & grabbing some prepped salads. Make a simple dressing of vinegar, lemon & oil.They offer already chopped,  spiralized, riced vegetables you just need to heat or add dressing. Easier way to eat healthy without a lot of prep work!
6459 2018-09-27 12:33:05 It marks the first time the DEA has formally recognized a CBD oil product as legal and safe. The agency is quick to point out that #Epidiolex is now the only legal #CBD oil recognized under federal law.

6462 2018-09-27 12:33:00 I’d recommend salicylic acid (a BHA that’s attracted to oil, clears out pores), glycolic acid (AHA chemical exfoliant that helps resurface skin) and maybe hyaluronic acid to help moisturize? Paula’s Choice 2% BHA and Pixi Glow Tonic are good places to start.

6486 2018-09-27 12:30:57 The implications of this for the movement of grain (and other rail traffic) out of western Canada are not good.  The negatives of not getting pipelines built extend far beyond Canada’s oil and gas industry.

6540 2018-09-27 12:25:25 Think about it. Saudi alone produces 10mn bbls/day+. A large storage tank is typically 100,000 bbls. To disrupt prices you’d need to empty the storage then refill repeatedly- Iran’s current production is large, but not a threat to world oil

I don't think oil was used.
The taste was awesome.

6553 2018-09-27 12:24:04 It can be made by transparent soap base + food coloring + mold. In fact, you can make transparent soap from edible oil and NaOH, but it may not be so colorless, and the formulation can be a little bit complex.

Economics 101 is that there should be demand destruction for prices to reduce if supply is not being increased. High prices should crimp demand in India.

Unless you’ve some news unknown to the oil industry, no country has so much storage that it’d hit oil prices hard for a prolonged period.

6594 2018-09-27 12:19:42 Unfortunately its possibly too late to meet with Trump. The NeoCons drums of War are loud, conditioning the US people for yet another US intervention into a sovereign country. Venezuela has oil and US democracy is drooling at the possibility of stealing it!

6602 2018-09-27 12:18:59 The denials, lies and the attempted coverup make it obvious there's been no rehabilitation
6603 2018-09-27 12:18:56 He has a point, we need to do something radical & need to do it quick because there's not much time left now, however our parliament doesn't have control over how our oil resources are used. There isn't single thing we can do about it other than legislate over what we do control.

6605 2018-09-27 12:18:42 And if you take out the excise taxes and 12 percent VAT, PH oil prices would even be lower. Malaysian and Indonesian oil prices are subsidized by their governments. :-)

6612 2018-09-27 12:18:01 Israel, the UK, Russia, the US, probably France and maybe Germany all have business interests in a lucrative new oil and gas find and the commercial interests drive the state interests, not the other way around.

6615 2018-09-27 12:16:45 obviously you are vag worshiper/TDS and not interested in a fair deal. Trudeau and compnay have screwed over the oil industry and now the auto industry with their virtue signaling. More interested in looking good instead of doing what is right for Canadians.

6619 2018-09-27 12:16:06 @cafreeland Let’s face it the US only has 10 more years of oil and Gas according to EIA so I am suggesting that you tax the 3.5 million bbls of oil that is shipped to them daily should they decide to tax vehicles shipped to the US. The tax sb $30/bbl to pay producer fairly to WTI

6669 2018-09-27 12:10:41 Oil has far more important uses in society than combustion, it's perfectly feasible to continue extracting it & be carbon neutral as long as you legislate over what it can be used for.
6670 2018-09-27 12:10:40 This whole thing is rather disgusting. CJP needs to walk his talk. Playing to the gallery loses its charm after a while. What happened to the bottles of olive oil and honey which he himself confiscated? Flat tyre again??

6686 2018-09-27 12:08:08 Sometimes our faces produce too much oil because the natural skin barrier has been damaged. So the skin’s sebaceous glands react by producing too much oil. You need to treat it at the root cause and get a proper skincare routine in place.

6710 2018-09-27 12:03:39 Did cost of production decrease? No. 2013 to 2015, worker's wages increase many folds, and so do cost of transportation. Moreover, that time oil was heavily subsidized, this Govt reduced the burden of subsidy which was indirectly effecting middle class tax payers. Si?

6723 2018-09-27 12:02:02 The US need to fix the price of oil because the defence bill for all their occupying bases overseas would become even more astronomical, NATO should not pick up the bill for this, if the US want to act like terrorists let them pay for it. #FailedState

6743 2018-09-27 12:00:12 But why exactly should I use a toner?
 It shrinks pores by removing excess oil
 It restores your skin's PH balance
 It adds a layer of protection to your skin
It adds moisture to the skin 
It refreshes the skin! Nothing beats revitalised skin when you’re on the go

6746 2018-09-27 11:59:44 Shouldn't we use the money from one to fund the development of the other, meaning we can successfully phase it out. Does nowhere in the world use oil? If we stop extracting it what will happen? Questions questions......

6774 2018-09-27 11:55:17 Totally agree. Imagine cheaper renewable energy tech like solar panels. Less dependency on the oil industry. Thank you for pushing this advocacy, Senator. REALLY hope that our very own Space Program comes to fruition. You have my vote.
6775 2018-09-27 11:55:04 During the Environmental Movement of the 1960’s patchouli oil was favoured over the more commercial perfumes on the market. Sometimes known as the hippie scent because of its smoky, spicy and earthy yet undoubtedly musky scent.
6776 2018-09-27 11:54:56 In spite of all the noise the trend is UP. Here is what never gets talked about, the oil market has shown unbelievable resilience in the face of a supply storm. Why? Decline curves keep getting steeper & until we get a price of oil that allows risk taking ($100+) that continues.

6821 2018-09-27 11:49:31 Holding oil imports at 10.25mbpd at $80/b vs 11.25mbpd at $100/b is a net reduction in imports of $111B, but this has much larger multiplier throughout the economy. It also avoids further investment in import terminal capacity and other infrastructure.

6919 2018-09-27 11:33:07 So in fact they’re currently pumping ZERO oil so the current oil price isn’t having an impact because they’re selling ZERO oil. Thank you for the clarification.
6920 2018-09-27 11:33:04 $100/b imperils the whole Chinese economy. China is quickly reaching scale where EVs impact oil prices. So EV policy becomes energy and economic policy going forward.

Hes not doing it so as to save future costs on repairs of trucks, it's to have huge savings in future taxes and it is allowed. It's also...

7012 2018-09-27 11:19:59 Ah I see. Hanukkah is indeed a celebration of lights but it is about the miracle that a tiny lamp kept burning for 8 days in a temple. It was a miracle because there wasn't enough oil in the lamp to burn that long. So yes, it is about lights but not about the days getting longer.

7052 2018-09-27 11:13:43 fortunately no, but that is only because they have been getting it right for years and have a superb oil fund, in fact, the first problem they had economically for a very long time was when the oil was deliberately deflated, not socialism.

7067 2018-09-27 11:11:21 It has nothing to do with my comforts.  Society needs to be weaned off of oil which means capping new oil projects and reducing existing ones proportionate to the growth of sustainable alternatives.  As for the jobs and social programs, there are more jobs in renewables than oil.

7111 2018-09-27 11:06:01 Hi Alex, while we understand that petrol prices can appear high at times, the price of fuel is determined by a number of factors including global oil prices and movements in the Australian dollar. 1/3

7127 2018-09-27 11:03:34 Let me guess, 3 of your favourite countries? Oil price is driven by supply. The extra supply from US shale played a part in that but wasn't done to purposely hurt Venezuela. The fact remains that the system in place could not deal with the fall in price so is an unfit system.
7128 2018-09-27 11:03:20 I am on the last 3 or 4 layers, so in about a month maybe, I am working on a rather big ampersand gessoboard that is 24 by 36 inches so it takes a while to complete with some very slow drying oil paint, and then about 6 to 8 months untill I can varish the painting.

7130 2018-09-27 11:02:51 US stock futures are up 0.15% with Europe mixed and Asia lower.  Oil is $72.35 with gold at $1,200. I think it can.

7136 2018-09-27 11:01:37 Why are you adding oil to Eba?After putting the cassava flakes in the hot water,pour out the extra water and cover the bowl for few minutes before you turn. You'd get the perfect consistency and it won't stick to her hands too.But the sticking part is determinant on type of garri
7137 2018-09-27 11:01:26 Furthermore, CBs will "print" gargantuan amounts of currency during next few years which should be bullish for some commodities like gold and oil. Oil is the blood of the techno industrial civilization and world reserves are in clear decline both in amount & net energy returned

I have no idea concerning the discoveries in Gabes 
There are few companies who will start looking for oil in Tataouine though.
7139 2018-09-27 11:01:03 There is a reason why Norway is so wealthy per person.
Large oil and gas reserves and a small population. 
Look up ‘state direct financial interest’ (SDFI) and the state-owned company Statoil/Equinor. Swimming in money (UK sold off its state oil company early 1980s - stupid, imo)

7142 2018-09-27 11:00:47 A very useful discussion today with @prpheller and @EfendievGalib of the @NRGInstitute. I told them that I will stay focused on transparency/accountability of the extractive industry because Azerbaijani experience in spending the oil and gas revenue is a nightmare.

7229 2018-09-27 10:47:54 This is beside the point, however, as the goal in opposing pipelines is not to cut off oil cold-turkey but to cap new oil infrastructure to (along with encouraging reduced use of petroleum products) foster a shift to sustainable alternatives.  Indigenous rights are also a factor.

7300 2018-09-27 10:39:23 Fair enough. But your original tweet has 7 likes/ppl believing it.
I’ve worked in Saudi/Iraq and saw oil production 1st hand - it comes out of the ground, sub-sea, or pipeline if agreed with another country - not by plane & 0 to do with Robinson (imo) - but folk like conspiracies
7301 2018-09-27 10:39:20 @Vorterix Mario, hablando de australianos, el cantante de Midnight Oil era juez. Y también era un ecologista intransigente.

7303 2018-09-27 10:39:13 even high quality medical marijuana should not be nearly as expensive as it is, and cannabis oil can be easily made on your stove-top if you have high quality marijuana; the government makes it as illegal and expensive as they can;

7305 2018-09-27 10:39:07 Venezuela’s entire economy was based on oil exports! When oil price dropped, the economy tanked. Norway has a diversified economy with their social system almost entirely funded by oil revenue, without which they would be much poorer. It’s a capitalistic paradise if anything.

7311 2018-09-27 10:38:10 What d'yu think a strike is supposed to solve? Our oil revenue isn't enough to pay salaries. D'yu think a strike will solve that problem?

What govt is trying to do is move away from oil by building infrastructure that'll allow Nigerians to produce & trade their way to prosperity

7328 2018-09-27 10:35:08 Yes a lot of the oil is stolen but not ALL of it, some of it is still used to fund projects in KRG and thats okay bram we all have our own opinions but just so you know I heavily dislike Turkey but this is the issue when we are landlocked.
7329 2018-09-27 10:34:49 But in defence of the push for RCTs in Government - this was an effort to get people to take evidence seriously, understand different confidence bands etc and frankly tackle the marketing of snake oil in eg school improvement.  (2)

7333 2018-09-27 10:34:06 Lool the oil doesn’t go to the people anyway but that’s a whole other issue but sorry bro I disagree I think the pdk has other motives for its support of turkey than just that of looking after the economic situation of the krg

7337 2018-09-27 10:33:40 Crude oil prices, our traditional cure for economic boom isn't working. Private sector is limited by low investment(makes no sense to invest beyond a certain point if consumers aren't there to buy) Hence govt spending, which is were we at is getting stretched.

7340 2018-09-27 10:33:30 Despite lower oil prices in 2015, not all OPEC nations entered into recession.

Transporting oil from other countries by air? You seriously think that?
7389 2018-09-27 10:28:11 We need to have a fact-based conversation on energy.

7416 2018-09-27 10:23:25 This is so frustrating - Norway is based on free market capitalism!!! And the only reason it has an effective social system is because it has enormous oil reserves that are not run by corrupt criminals... next.
7417 2018-09-27 10:23:03 That won't happen, because you declaring war on the oil consuming countries, all justifying the war against Iran and give an excuse to the USA as well

7453 2018-09-27 10:18:25 I’m struggling to follow your thought process.
Aramco is the biggest, yes (though national output in Russia & USA matches it)
“It’s for oil” - the US produces enough oil for itself, and why wld it allow Chinese & Russian oil companies into Iraq if it wanted oil so much?

12 years of being in power, PDP refused to pay Nigeria Airways Retirees yet we had oil boom.
Buhari of the APC remembered Nigeria Airways Retirees less than 4 years.
Thank you PMB!
7551 2018-09-27 10:06:45 If you badly wanted oil (& gas) you’d invade:

You wouldn’t invade:
Afghan

7555 2018-09-27 10:06:17 @TVAshleigh I used to love your show but stopwatching. You are obsessed with the Watts case.  I can"t stand to watch those 2 little girls dancing so happy & they were put into an oil well. It is too heart wrenching & there are plenty of other crimes you should be covering. bye
7556 2018-09-27 10:05:53 Me too with palm oil
7557 2018-09-27 10:05:45 まってくれ
7558 2018-09-27 10:05:37 Yes!  Same idea just with paint now on Gelli plates.  We use to do stencils and smear oil pastels to get the shapes.

7565 2018-09-27 10:05:10 When you're frying yam, plantain and the rest. At a time, do you put according to the width of the frying pan or the depth of the oil?

let's know the good cooks on here.

7570 2018-09-27 10:03:52 Now @afreximbank extends $90M trade facility to the South Sudan government to be repaid from oil revenues. In August, their parliament approved a budget of 81.6 billion South Sudanese pounds ($584 million) for the 2018/19 fiscal year. (via PR)
7571 2018-09-27 10:03:35 Yes, 'coz oil/arms sales create many jobs in US/EU. Earnings by upstart Saudi Arabia finance their export of fundamentalist Sunni Wahabbi Islam. Most 9/11 perps were Saudi. Vicious circle! Iran, formerly Persia, is a real country which contributed much to history/civilisation.
7572 2018-09-27 10:03:29 1000万円空から降って来てほしい
7573 2018-09-27 10:03:27 With US economy nearly overheating & fracking industry deeply indebted but having made US self sufficient in hydrocarb i question that the US industry or economy wants lower hydrocarbon prices The fracking industry actualy "needs" higher prices & Big Oil laughs all the way 2 bank
7574 2018-09-27 10:03:25 Lakin that was the point of while argument. How intl estab, army, idaray, US’s oil wars, etc conspired against him. Bringing him down and install a puppet PM who wid listen to them. Pivot of the whole argu is NS. How can we leave him out of equation?
7575 2018-09-27 10:03:19 We'll be there tasting our cold pressed rapeseed oil, dressings and mayonnaise!
7576 2018-09-27 10:03:03 Afghan - little oil
Yemen - little oil
Syria - not much oil

Iraq - ok (I’ve first hand experience)

Saudi - not invaded

Iran - cld get bombed, but not worth invading for oil when US is self-sufficient

Not sure what your point is with that pic
7577 2018-09-27 10:02:26 Odumakin so u are still a Nigerian, this nation n its citizens have been going thru great pains. And I asked myself where are d Odumakins that made sure that oil subsidy was not removed in January 2012, where are they now, to stage protest, for d bad governance of her God fathers
7578 2018-09-27 10:02:23 will that oil benefit Zimbabwe?   Without good governance it will only bring us more misery
7579 2018-09-27 10:02:12 社会人になった瞬間1000万の借金は卒業する前からわかってたけど、返し始めるとめちゃしんどい
7580 2018-09-27 10:01:55 Yeah what people do in their countries is none of my business. However my business is this country. I do not agree with bombing all these countries for oil and for America to place its army bases all over the place. We sold a bomb that was used to kill 40+ kids. That’s in 2018

7586 2018-09-27 10:00:22 Did I just hear Becci talking to the cooker saying ‘let’s get some oil on this bitch’

7591 2018-09-27 09:59:28 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
7592 2018-09-27 09:59:04 You fucked up, I once did this with a  daughter and her mum we were coming back from Abj to kano together , they were nice, we even prayed at musafir masjid by d road side, I should have got d num then ,but I was like tunda tana ABU we will surely meet,till today
7593 2018-09-27 09:58:59 BP should open the sea floor and spill more oil
7594 2018-09-27 09:58:22 What do you think is more costly......stain and oil oak veneered MDF or painted finish MR MDF for use as a wardrobe carcass?

7597 2018-09-27 09:58:12 Lol, he's not asking you to fry it 

Just a drop of oil into the boiling water
7598 2018-09-27 09:58:12 I second this - fry it in a wok with oil and oyster sauce, steam it a bit with a drop lid and you have the vegetable part of a Chinese-ish meal with an English Vegetable.
7599 2018-09-27 09:58:04 Its a warning ,those guys are in boiling cooking oil anyone who opposes them is an enemy ...

7604 2018-09-27 09:57:49 why do people love talking to me about cars!!! like shit man i barely know how to change my oil so why you all up in my grill about it !!!!
7605 2018-09-27 09:57:41 How about we get back to Formula 47 with the fries? Improved taste and better than the terrible oil that is used now...

7610 2018-09-27 09:56:40 AHAHAHAHAHAH ! Merde, je ne te savais pas dans une telle insécurité. Alors, je te rassure, je n'y retrouvais pas grand chose de commun avec toi. Par contre, que nous ayons tous - au planning - un petit côté Snake Oil Seller, c'est pas faux.
7611 2018-09-27 09:56:30 Oooo what's the brand pls?
I love JA castor oil but can only use on scalp

7614 2018-09-27 09:56:13 Where can I get tea tree oil? 
It doesn't mess up foundation right?
7615 2018-09-27 09:56:13 CBD oil!!! None of the psychoactive effects of cannabis and it really calms anxiety and helps with sleep so much! And 100% natural 
7616 2018-09-27 09:56:06 Lol ... I like the chart .. have traded this before .. bit on the sell side but news and Oil price action can push this on.

7621 2018-09-27 09:54:48 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
7622 2018-09-27 09:54:42 Advertisers working for companies *selling* facial recognition snake oil lie about false positive (and false negative) rates - to sell their product.
7623 2018-09-27 09:54:37 They’re looking to fit the filtration system to ~5k busses, they’re not all going to be electric. It makes sense to trial it on a derv to see if it’s worth doing. Don’t forget a Euro 6 vehicle is quite a clean machine for an oil burner. (Not saying dervs are clean)
7624 2018-09-27 09:54:35 yes oil yummy

7654 2018-09-27 09:50:38 340 million is hard to visualise. But what about the true cost of taking these out of use over the supply chain? How much energy does it take to manufacture 340 million plastic bottles? From oil extraction, transport, refining, and distribution. Must be substantial.

7693 2018-09-27 09:45:27 TD Securities: The next move in #oil matters insofar as it offers a good reason to keep the selloff in global rates moving, especially as global output gaps are closing. Higher oil prices would support the #ECB's confidence that #inflation is headed in the right direction.

7696 2018-09-27 09:45:24 I think you are mistaking this road for another, this about 2kms Apapa road is been financed by Dangote, Flour Mill, and NPA with no string attached.

But the one of Tin-can Island is going to be financed by Dangote alone and it's going to attract Tax holiday of about 10yrs.
7697 2018-09-27 09:45:01 Can you two talk about how Nexus wanted the oil pipeline in North Dakota even though they acted like the big saviors who were 'about helping' the Native Americans protesting at Standing Rock? Can you talk about how TYT gets $ from Nexus as well as other Left media?

7827 2018-09-27 09:24:08 Awww. Well me too. But it is what it is. I haven’t had the guts to not take them and see how I feel.  I trust my med team that it’s helping me somehow (I forget exactly). But today is the last of the taper off dose. I’ll use CBD oil and my day will be just fine.

7839 2018-09-27 09:23:05 What do they do with them? It used to be here in Massachusetts we harvested whale oil and baleen, etc - what do they need so much today, it's worth killing them for?

Is the following enough or not? Building plants, building 3 wind farms, building 24 solar farms, smart metering, using natural gaz instead of fuel oil, reparing the grid, upgrading the transformers.......
7842 2018-09-27 09:22:47 We'd love to do something in the future Angela if we can afford it - but we inherited the oil system (though we did get the most efficient boiler we could find at the time) - no gas - and we're not allowed solar panels (but looking into that).

7844 2018-09-27 09:22:29 This is BS.  Not a single one of those wind turbines was manufactured in Scotland.  Just like oil and gas everyone else is exploiting our wind resource.   It's the lazy way to achieve climate change policy but it's sod all real benefit industrially.
7845 2018-09-27 09:22:18 You are a rarity then. Most folks in metros & urban areas do spend a lot of time in restaurants. As I mentioned earlier at an industrial scale companies much prefer using palm oil. It’s a case of cost & quantity
7846 2018-09-27 09:21:54 年上を敬うのは良いけど年下も当然敬うべきなんだよな。つまりは、他人は敬うべきで、何かしらその人から得られるものだったり自分には無いものだったりを見つけられるものだってこと。年齢でそれは変わらないし、年下だからといって侮ることのナンセンスさを最近また感じている。

7850 2018-09-27 09:21:30 No brief here for Google.

7864 2018-09-27 09:19:28 Try putting water into an empty spray bottle , leave in conditioner and any hair oil that works for you, for me it's  almond oil. Shake well and spray everyday. Additional to moisturizing with coconut oil/any thick based oil that works for u, after you've sprayed that mix.

7874 2018-09-27 09:18:31 That's a leftist adoctrination argument, US has more oil than the entire planet. Oil is a energy that is being displaced and will continue going in that direction. Venezuelan oil is to heavy, it will soon be in disuse, but we will benefit from privatization in the mean time.

7998 2018-09-27 08:57:21 Yes, plus there are a whole lot of other considerations to take into account. such as the cost of Brexit, the fact that we pay a disproportionate amount to areas such as defence, that we gain little from the oil revenues and the fact that we have higher GDP per capita.

8007 2018-09-27 08:56:09 Great news! Whaling is the most sustainable and environmentally friendly source of meat on the planet. Whale stocks are growing and no longer hunted for their oil, that lead to the horrific slaughter in the south oceans in the post war era.
8008 2018-09-27 08:56:07 Shame on this tweet. In 2011 & 2013 crude oil prices anged 100 to 140 dollars & Petrol was less than Rs. 70. After 2014 crude prices crashed to 40 & now 70, hence Govt buying cheap crude selling Petrol at Rs.90 making huge profits. Present Govt. Increased Excise duty by ₹10.

8016 2018-09-27 08:54:00 Cartoons like yourself are ignorant about the double digit inflation that was plaguing the common man and if you've read something other than champak or Archie Comics you'd know that inflation affects not only oil costs but every product or service the billion+ population buys.

As an environmentalist, I hate that some protections were removed to open up energy exploration.

Fracking (I’m opposed) & other efficiencies allow us to recover oil that was previously considered lost. Natural gas is a byproduct.

8058 2018-09-27 08:48:32 We can't get oil out of Canada other than to the USA. That's why the price is so cheap. That's also why Trans mountain is a huge deal
8059 2018-09-27 08:48:30 And perhaps Scotland would start levying taxes on the oil industry like Norway does... seems to have worked pretty well for them.  You know, what with having the world’s largest sovereign fund - having discovered oil (but less) in the same year as Scotland.

8060 2018-09-27 08:48:25 Nope but you can grow algae instead. They are edible, can produce oil, animal feedstocks, drugs, vegetable fats and oils,consume more CO2/kg  and will grow in salt infested inland areas  where there is poor land.

8073 2018-09-27 08:46:25 Govt allowing monopolistic oil, bank,superannuation,electricity and supermarket companies to over charge and misrepresent what they sell with relative impunity.

8153 2018-09-27 08:35:15 I don't think the greenback is safe at all with the current levels of debt. Especially not since countries like China is organizing a circumvention of the petro dollar (pricing oil in Yuan instead of USD) That further decrease the demand for USD.

8359 2018-09-27 08:01:07 #TheEarlyMorningRushShow Dear Mofe and crew good morning. The tax to GDP ratio is a function of the nations productivity. It is an entity that produces something to generate income that can be taxed. WE DO NOT PRODUCE. Crude oil is the major component of our GDP. God bless us.

8404 2018-09-27 07:54:21 No they don’t. They put warm oil on real babies to make it look realistic and use prosthetic babies that are weighted and look real when doing harder scenes so they don’t hurt the baby. I think that’s what they said in an interview

8416 2018-09-27 07:52:25 Again, which trade agreements? And it's not as if buyers have no other suppliers to turn to. This is international business. Not G-to-G agreements! Like will India, China or the EU commit to buy specific quantities of M'sian palm oil?
8417 2018-09-27 07:52:22 Interesting.
Seems quite (overly) simplistic application of cost of capital.

Would have thought (unproven) oil & gas exploration discount rate should be even higher than that.

Not that I, for 1 second, have any confidence in Megan Woods having faintest understanding the nuance.
8418 2018-09-27 07:52:13 Don't know #NBI well but real test of management is how they navigate the cycle. They seem to have made hay when Oil above $100 and had a disaster handling the slump. They're though certainly not alone in that in O&G services (as I know to my cost!)

8494 2018-09-27 07:36:30 McDonalds doesn't use peanut oil because it's too expensive.  Carrying an epi-pen and knowing what you are eating are good safe guards.  You just never know.

8498 2018-09-27 07:35:46 I have been looking and I can see that lots of foreign interests do not want to see Canadians exporting Oil. My question is what has our own Federal Government been doing. Alberta can’t even sell Oil to Canadians. Considering the Massive Amount of money at stake I wonder W5.

Even to work a little on the US overlords who put the sanctions in place.

8531 2018-09-27 07:29:45 Bolton and Pompeo are now panicking. India said no to stopping Iran oil trading and now Europe are proposing alternative Iranian payments outside SWIFT.

8544 2018-09-27 07:27:18 Trudeau can't get a pipeline built, so the US is our only market for oil at least for the next few years. 

And oil has nothing to do with the 300% dairy import tariffs and the Dairy Monopoly with its high-price fixing that is ripping off Canadian consumers.

8557 2018-09-27 07:24:49 First of all you should check WHY the refugees had to flee. The conflict in Syria is about oil pipeline from SA to turkey crossing the Iran/ Lebanon pipeline.

8574 2018-09-27 07:21:38 Corruption breeds a highly unequal society. There is no worse corruption than slavely that was the main cause of the 1861 American civil war. In Iran all proceeds from oil used to benefit very few pple who were either family members of Shah Pahlavi or his cronies
8575 2018-09-27 07:21:29 Be specific. Which international trade agreements? And which international trade agreements specifically include favourable treatment for M'sian commodities like crude oil, palm oil & rubber? Afaik, the PH govt has not pulled M'sia out of RCEP, Apec & Asean.

8703 2018-09-27 06:57:20 The price and supply of oil is far more complicated. OPEC is necessary to control the steady decline in oil supplies exacerbated by geopolitical factors in Venezuela and now also Iran. If the rest of the world runs out, U.S. can use it but they too will run out eventually.

8752 2018-09-27 06:49:01 Omg my dad forwarded me an article about this like “BEWARE!!! of fake olive oil - it’s everywhere!!” The pressing issues of our time
8753 2018-09-27 06:48:18 Aaand the bus had an oil leak
8754 2018-09-27 06:48:00 Why does “Snake Oil Salesman” always come to mind. So many have been duped. #basta #voteblue

8756 2018-09-27 06:47:17 Brilliant I love it, better than the original imo
8757 2018-09-27 06:47:14 In 2017, ALL the revenues from oil could not cover salaries. It’s up to Nigerians to decide on this - if you keep quiet as NLC fights for a bigger share of non-existent revenues, you have technically agreed to it
8758 2018-09-27 06:47:08 Really don't see what my "romantic life" (not that there's anything romantic about it) has to do with my professional career. Why assume I'd mix them. They're like water and oil. Work me vs. Intimate me aren't the same person.
8759 2018-09-27 06:46:29 Just a way to divert attention from rafale , jobs, economy, oil, and every one plays along
8760 2018-09-27 06:46:09 Another cab ride and have to add one more item, “Oil Change Required”.  Maintenance is a suggestion not a requirement eh
8761 2018-09-27 06:46:05 My Mom was gifted Olive Oil, first thing that came out of her mouth was ‘Ohhhh they bought me annoiting oil’  #ChristianMoms

8765 2018-09-27 06:45:52 I used  vote Labour  untill I realised that Labour hid my country's oil wealth and in all their time in power in Scotland they built 6 houses they took woman to court so they didn't have to give them eaqul pay they landed us with pfis that cost  millions so now I vote SNP.

8767 2018-09-27 06:45:36 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

8771 2018-09-27 06:44:55 How can I get it & what is CBD oil all about
8772 2018-09-27 06:44:37 #CPTTraffic On Steenberg Road direction M3 northbound a vehicle overturned. The ramp is closed to traffic and motorists are advised to proceed with caution as there is an oil sleek on the roadway
8773 2018-09-27 06:44:06 Pollution is main concern and oil not that we dont like but main problem is spillage and wildlife harm and us!  Nuclear is waste buried until earth plates shift etc etc
8774 2018-09-27 06:43:44 Yea shave it so I can rub oil on your head
8775 2018-09-27 06:43:44 Please go on question time and humiliate the snake oil salesmen. Would love to see how enraged the gammon in the audience (which is usually most of the audience) would be
8776 2018-09-27 06:43:23 CBD oil is really the best thing to happen for my scoliosis pain
8777 2018-09-27 06:43:23 You don’t have engine oil 
8778 2018-09-27 06:43:18 Considering the amount of bile and vitriol he's spewing these days against PM Modi, you would think @RahulGandhi gargles twice a day a cocktail of bhang lassi and tantric snake oil. @divyaspandana @BJP4India #RahulKaPuraKhandanChor #RafaleDeal @INCIndia
8779 2018-09-27 06:41:53 Tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. Drizzle with olive oil and balasamic vinegar.  É perfetto.

8783 2018-09-27 06:40:43 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
8784 2018-09-27 06:40:42 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8785 2018-09-27 06:40:33 Please read the article properly ,they are not hundred percent sure,they is a chance that we might  have oil .

8787 2018-09-27 06:40:26 I know. Now, many others will also! It’s us against the world, so that our oligarchs can extend the lifetime of their oil investments!
8788 2018-09-27 06:40:21 There ya go using logic and common sense with liberals. That’s like trying to mix oil n water!
8789 2018-09-27 06:40:07 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。

8792 2018-09-27 06:39:55 I don’t have orajel but clove oil works similarly in the sense that it numbs your gum and gives temporary pain relief. I don’t have anything stronger they’re 200mg
8793 2018-09-27 06:39:42 Crash on Steenberg Rd west onto Blue Route, (M3) northbound. Oil spillage and vehicle overturned. Ramp from Main Rd side to M3 North closed. Use alternative route.

8795 2018-09-27 06:39:03 Go search up daesh oil money trails then come back. And if you personally meet any daesh people, ask them. Your lack of knowledge is laughable.

8800 2018-09-27 06:38:29 I took my essential oil diffuser outside and diffused citronella for two hours so I could maybe weed my garden.

It didn’t do jack. 
Garden will just have to choke.
8801 2018-09-27 06:38:16 朝早いのほんとゴミなんだよね
8802 2018-09-27 06:37:57 I think New Delhi should set up a payment system to allow oil companies and businesses to continue trading with #Iran in a bid to evade US sanctions.
It'll overcome the Oil crisis in India at that time.

8805 2018-09-27 06:37:28 is having 3 kids by 25 what people from these states with oil jobs do? Part of the reason why Mackenzie is so frustrated is because she’s literally never been anything other than a mother and she became a mother before she became a woman. That’s a recipe for disaster  #TeenMomOG
8806 2018-09-27 06:37:12 В 2018/19 МГ Казахстан будет мировым лидером в производстве масличного льна

По оценкам аналитиков Oil World, в 2018/19 МГ мировым лидером по объемам производства семян льна будет Казахстан, где ожидается рекордный для страны урожай масличной – 0,7 млн. тонн. Второе и третье мес
8807 2018-09-27 06:36:59 Doesn’t matter if inflation from tariff wars and sanctions on Iran drive up the cost of everything including oil. It has ALL been wiped out.

8815 2018-09-27 06:36:12 Aku sih tim cleansing oil. Jadi biore
8816 2018-09-27 06:35:54 Because there is increased crude oil price that does not equate to an improved economy.

Just thought to drop this quietly.
8817 2018-09-27 06:35:53 Saudi Arabia deserves nothing. Without oil this country would be the backwater of the world. But the reality is we love our oil more than our principles. Whether Canada has to submit is a pragmatic economic question.
8818 2018-09-27 06:35:50 I'll be having a oil diffuser ,candle , wallflower plug in & candle wax melts all going at once & it's heaven omggg

DAESH IS EVERYWHERE WHERE “USA” IS! U got ur this fact right!
8822 2018-09-27 06:35:02 If you  dont tag me in I dont see any of your tweets as I dont follow you.
Should I follow you as I only like positivity ?
8823 2018-09-27 06:34:32 President @CyrilRamaphosa must unleash the gas fields in the Karoo & get the economy high on hydracarbons. Also he must seriously think of a Sasol 2 as a PPP to produce & refine oil locally via licenced GTL technology. He must lead this charge & turn SA into a petro-economy!
8824 2018-09-27 06:34:25 @realDonaldTrump Thank you! Oil prices almost double in past 2yrs with relatively no change at the pump, thanks again from the working class!
8825 2018-09-27 06:34:19 Gordon Ramsay's understanding of fire -

8826 2018-09-27 06:34:06 Oil is actually work too but Nigeria does everything upside down.

8830 2018-09-27 06:33:17 Banning more tankers might not save the whales, but campaigning for more isn’t going to help them either. Clearly, selling oil to Asia is more important to you, than what happens to any Orcas!
8831 2018-09-27 06:33:15 @WeeMissBea purchased the same CBD oil after your review of it (and how looking for something else that helps the full onset anxiety that I have) but what percentage did you buy? If you bought 10% had you tried the 5% to start off with?
8832 2018-09-27 06:33:14 We now hear from JY Lim, our Director of Asia-Pacific Oil Market Analysis. He’ll be covering Asian product and market trends. #PlattsAnalytics
8833 2018-09-27 06:33:14 Yes. It's good to read about what's in crude oil too. It'll curl your hair just to read how toxic it is. Then think about oil spills, spills in the ocean, in rivers, on land where food is grown, where animals graze, where aquifers are. We all must educate ourselves.
8834 2018-09-27 06:33:05 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to Goldman Sachs. Either that, or put it on eBay
8835 2018-09-27 06:33:02 I did a coconut oil treatment over night, then bleached, toned, then dyed my hair. Took me a few hours to finish completely. It's allowing yourself breaks between steps that make it take longer. 
8836 2018-09-27 06:32:14 Add oil!

8840 2018-09-27 06:31:37 When are you going to promote production of things like soya, wheat so that we stop importation of crude oil, flour etc. Doesnt that kill industrialisation you keep talking about

8843 2018-09-27 06:30:50 Pretty daft statement, even by your standards tel! Clearly Westminster never had an agenda for the North Sea oil in 1707, but would you care to explain the more recent maritime border changes? Obviously oil isn’t the agenda so the oilfields they gained by this are irrelevant?

8850 2018-09-27 06:29:37 Agriculture is work.. Hard work

8851 2018-09-27 06:29:36 It's going to crash and crash hard. The boom is a false bubble, several technically,  all going back in time. Trump has basically taken us from the forefront and pushed us back to coal, oil and natural gas. These are all being phased out around the world.
8852 2018-09-27 06:29:01 @Ritzcrackers stop using Wilmar dirty palm oil and end massive forest destruction in Indonesia. Enough is enough
8853 2018-09-27 06:29:00 You realize that a majority of what we get is already from the Middle East. Why export our oil through pipeline and tanker to be refined when it can be done here and supplied to Canadians. Cut down traffic there, and begin investing into clean energy—something that is huge now.
8854 2018-09-27 06:29:00 @democracynow: .@AntoniaJuhasz, who has long reported on oil, calls for water to take its place: "What we really need in the U.S. is a massive investment in water pipeline construction. Same job skills, same unions. Those same workers can build water pipelines."
8855 2018-09-27 06:28:26 I do not watch CNN BBC. And you need to get your facts right. DAESH Oil routes are through Turkey, not Iraq. Turkey facilitated move off men and material from its borders. Its all documented by independent reporters.

8884 2018-09-27 06:23:54 McDonald's changed there type of oil years ago. They were using vegetable oil. I used to work for them.
8885 2018-09-27 06:23:49 Turbines kill birds, but so do oil spills. But oil does so much more worse, and of course it has to be burned eventually, after the dirty process of refining. Plastic bag ban cost doesn't mean it's ineffective. Please name the "sane workable solutions" R's are pushing.

8906 2018-09-27 06:18:33 Markets don't go straight up or down even if there's a catalyst. I don't believe in Iran sanction phobia either but a 1% fall in oil prices over 2 days isn't a valid rationale to disprove Iran sanctions as a catalyst imho

8908 2018-09-27 06:18:29 Every veggie asks for patience, and a willingness to learn its particular magic. Broccoli must never be boiled. It needs a kiss of steam, a benevolence of flash-frying, Asian dressing, umami, seductively silky satay dip, olive oil with lemon and garlic. Joy to your tastebuds.

8927 2018-09-27 06:15:06 We don’t have to export or sell all our natural raw minerals, we should keep and build up a reserve of some minerals. These become more valuable over time and give some form of control in the world market, like what the big economies of the world do with gold, oil and gas.
8928 2018-09-27 06:15:03 Use oil ... simple oil
8929 2018-09-27 06:14:54 Stop drinking cooking oil while you're at it.
8930 2018-09-27 06:14:53 I used to have a lots of people coming by to eat + kids- when I cooked a LOT I would go thru 5lbs of garlic/month.

8931 2018-09-27 06:14:47 Spearheaded peace? Maybe that's how they sell it afterwards. But there was a strategic interest behind every single operation, you can count of that! Oil or other resources, influence and power in a region, that's what the "pax Americana" is about.

8935 2018-09-27 06:14:14 Thank you for your reply. Glad to see your stance on RSPO palm oil, how long will it be before you to stop supporting companies by not selling their products in your stores that don’t have RSPO palm please? When will you take a stand and advertise the RSPO logo in your stores?

8961 2018-09-27 06:09:15 @dpradhanbjp then same should be applicable when economy was rocking post 2014 or was it solely because of comparatively very low Oil cost and more than doubled petroleum tax revenue

8983 2018-09-27 06:05:41 Corbyn is a social democrat, moderate center-left. His policies look radical only because they are preceded by 39 years of neoliberal consensus.
Venezuela's Bolivarian economy is tied to oil. When oil prices are low, any type of government in Venezuela would be in trouble.

8999 2018-09-27 06:01:55 Oil is a natural resource whose sharing is governed by law that allows host county a distinct share. If we allow Muranga to tax Nairobi for water, Mombasa will do so for the harbour, Nyeri will demand royalties for cold winds blowing from Mr Kenya, Etc.Give us a break!
9000 2018-09-27 06:01:53 You are a hypocrite following your outburst against OPEC Nations; you want cheap and even free oil but you make stiffer immigration policies over flimsy reasons thereby preventing people from getting to the US even for medical reasons. Remove your speck first
9001 2018-09-27 06:01:32 When the British were the super power, the colonised a huge chunk of the world for resources. When the US became a super power they destabilised the Middle East to get the resource they needed the most, oil.

9006 2018-09-27 06:00:02 Lmao reducing govt spend and increasing non-oil revenues is the only way, our current oil revenues can barely support our wage structure
9007 2018-09-27 05:59:39 yes. The oil changes over time, plus the emulsion used would very likely be different now to 38 years ago.
9008 2018-09-27 05:59:21 Can we counter sue the oil companies for endangerment to our great grandchildren’s futures ??
9009 2018-09-27 05:59:19 The amount of oil being pumped is higher yet prices are still rising. That doesn’t calculate.

9284 2018-09-27 05:07:56 Khuzestan home to some 2m Arabs holds the vast majority of Iran’s oil reserves but is poor and neglected. Arabs say they are kept out of local government and Revolutionary Guards steal the region’s water as well as its #oil.

9286 2018-09-27 05:07:37 Venezuela's problem is dependence on oil. A problem the whole world has, capitalist or socialist. Chavez didn't count on the price of oil fluctuating.

9288 2018-09-27 05:07:17 How can oil prospects be confirmed? If it's prospects, it means it's unconfirmed. I would be happier if we hear OIL RESERVES CONFIRMED

9292 2018-09-27 05:06:45 Trump praised Modi because he agreed to not buy crude oil from Iran in November. Most coward government in the history of India .
9293 2018-09-27 05:06:34 it’s a bit painful the first few times, but you look forward to it after a while. don’t have caffeine the day of your appointment, apply witch hazel on cotton after, and dry brush between appointments. oil can clog your pores
9294 2018-09-27 05:06:25 In last six months, the crude oil price has increased from 63 USD/barrel to 81 USD/barrel. What is your source of information about decrese in crude oil prices ?
9295 2018-09-27 05:05:36 I’ve had my fair share of these moments. But I was at the car service place in May and I had to call my mom to tell her the price of my oil change and the lady next to me goes “I don’t know what you were saying...but I could listen to it all day. It was beautiful” I almost cried

9313 2018-09-27 05:02:34 1. You would have to limit oil production, Canada can't do that, it has no single state owned oil company that runs everything
2. A great deal of Canada's oil is tarsands oil. It takes greater refining, and refineries specifically adapted to it. It will always sell at a discount

9320 2018-09-27 05:01:50 Does Mr Trump realise that we OPEC countries survive by selling oil? we love high oil prices,it's good for us. Nigeria first!.
But we can work out a deal where the US pays us billions of dollars every year and we vote for low oil prices.
@realDonaldTrump is a good deal maker.

9350 2018-09-27 04:57:59 When is the last time you looked at the big picture? Our military illegally invades Afghanistan and Iraq, so we can literally rape the earth by stealing oil, and then steal more land so we can guard the biggest poppy plantations on Earth.

9355 2018-09-27 04:57:41 This’s only a partial view.
Approx. 55% of gasoline prices in India constitute the state / federal taxes.
The government never passed on the benefits to the people when the oil prices crashed.
Now, when the oil price is on the rise, India has one of the highest gasoline prices !

9380 2018-09-27 04:54:59 The decision to cancel oil and gas exploration will cost billions while having either no impact or negative impact on emissions. It is virtue signalling at best irrespective of whether you are a climate change believer, denier or uncertain.

9425 2018-09-27 04:48:55 Oil Kings are 3-0 on the year. Its early, but wins count for just as much in September as they do in February.

EOK were down 2-0 and this is a game that they probably would have lost 5-1 a year ago.

Definitely a more mature group. Very impressive start
9426 2018-09-27 04:48:48 This sounds so crazy. You have entire countries, in this case some of the biggest economies, basically planning to become rogue oil traders.

9459 2018-09-27 04:43:40 Kudos to Turkey for defying Trump's sanctions on Iran including the sale of its oil, for the benefit of its people. The sanctions will hit the people of Iran more than its Govt. Other 57 members of the OIC should also follow the example set by its current Chairman, Presd. Erdogan

9489 2018-09-27 04:39:24 India's major firms are planning to stop importing oil from Iran in November, Bloomberg reported on 25 Sept. Oil price will keep going up. Is it the cost of India inching closure to US? It happened earlier but it is closure this time. Is it because both leaders think alike?

9559 2018-09-27 04:27:10 doesn't matter how much oil they export if they aren't allowed to import food. Same reason why north Korea has problems despite being extremely mineral rich. If sanctions didn't do anything what would be the point? Iraq also had oil money and we starved their people to weaken gov

9568 2018-09-27 04:25:03 Wat abt cannibis oil ???
9569 2018-09-27 04:24:55 i think its because dow went down below its highs again, when it first went over its highs we were bullish af, lots of oil stocks 30%+up, we still have decent gapups tho. DOW is the last piece of puzzle to a bullish market imo, but its failing atm, looks like sp500 may fail too.

9656 2018-09-27 04:11:34 The biggest thing to remember is that self care is not a reward. It is preventative maintenance; like an oil change or a tire rotation.

9668 2018-09-27 04:09:20 Interesting. @matthewherper & others raised the PBO oil and PBO LDL-C issue as well.  We should tease this out. Looking at LDL particles and/or apo B might help a bit, but we probably need to look at markers of cholesterol absorption and production like in 4S (or statin PK).

9690 2018-09-27 04:05:36 BUT coldpressed oil still contains the lipid that causes allergic reactions.

9842 2018-09-27 03:38:22 Isn't it odd how any time a kkkonservativ gets truth thrown at them, they resort to insult, personal attack, and argumentum ad hominem? #TickTock
9843 2018-09-27 03:38:10 I find it weird that Magdalo & the Reds are in cahoots. Unless it’s a case of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”, but these two are literally oil & water. And it’s weird that there’s a destab plot against a President who is claimed to be popular & well-loved like Jesus Christ.
9844 2018-09-27 03:37:44 Oh and i heard that you still want our abundance of oil and gas. LMAO

Interestingly castor oil is not.

9893 2018-09-27 03:30:47 It's not what you know, it's who you know. One of my best friends/mentors in the trucking world owns a 50 truck fleet and was an Ice Road Trucker for 15 years. He wanted to branch out to running oil rig supplies from Houston to Alaska and I was at the top of his list to ask.

9903 2018-09-27 03:30:11 Crude Oil is just as “natural” as Natural Gas. They both derive from buried, long-dead, decomposed plants & animals.

9904 2018-09-27 03:30:00 Good luck with that...never ever underestimate us! Without our oil, your nation stops. We can sell it to others. Just remember that. BTW, your president does not treat us like an ally. Enjoy your evening!

9912 2018-09-27 03:29:01 Gold is like oil. 
For every Oz or Bbl sold you need to replace with another . 
Resources are expensive, risky old and played out IMO.
Much rather flic a switch to replace that Oz or Bbl with the cannabis. Extremely low risk with extremely high revenue margins 
9913 2018-09-27 03:28:31 And stepping back a second, the Oklahoma City mayor is naming these general causes, but his city is in fact an important center in oil and gas. There’s hardly any actual data in his argument either.

9949 2018-09-27 03:24:45 Outdated - based on information from 2011 and NOT in line with current deployments, let alone future. Also, not clear this is comparing lifetime metal costs of full extraction, refining, transport of the fuel supply (coal/gas/oil/etc) - or just the single-plant build cost.
9950 2018-09-27 03:24:43 @IKlympush Dear Madam, sorry to distrubed you, could you please help me in finding a reliable source of Sunflower Oil refinery in your country? Thanks in advance.

I remember Mukesh bhai quoting ‘data is the new oil’ in one of his speech. Is it that for every little thing we got to fight it thru our courts??
9959 2018-09-27 03:23:16 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
9960 2018-09-27 03:23:07 The LWCF is largely funded through royalties on federal offshore oil and gas leases. He knows this - the entire Montana delegation knows this and all of them have campaigned for the fund to be permanently funded. And it should be.

9988 2018-09-27 03:19:26 Speaking of polluting, CAN is alright w/ polluting US by sending tar sands oil thru KPL. We process & are stuck w/ the sludge & pollution. Trump is ok w/the sludge & pollution cuz oil & gas make profit

He is all in on Paris Climate Accord but, is Trudeau true environmentalist?
