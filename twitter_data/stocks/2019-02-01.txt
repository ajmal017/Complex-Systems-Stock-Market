1 2019-02-02 23:58:04 did you use any stocks in this or is it all from scrap??
2 2019-02-02 23:56:36 You do realize that 48% of the US pop. does not own stocks. Of those that do, 84% are owned by the top 10% of wage earners. Stocks r, for the most part, the domain of the upper class & super wealthy Most people can't afford to retire. Your argument is based on false presumptions.
3 2019-02-02 23:56:27 Oh I wonder, has the rat (cough yg cough) realized how big he has fucked up this time? lmao watch he stocks going down down babyy~~
4 2019-02-02 23:56:12 I'm not an expert on the 2nd ammendment. But bump stocks aren't necessarily covered by the 2nd ammendment right? It's just merely an accessory.

Banning bumpstocks to me isn't really a sign we're gonna ban guns. But i guess it's closer to that than everything is ok.
5 2019-02-02 23:50:49 Extremely disappointed with my play today, I couldn't stop shaking even against my round 1 and 2 and my movement was sticky. Kept getting fullhops and couldn't fast fall. Got tons of dash attacks. SD'd all 3 stocks in one game. Very mad at myself, because I won't get many events-
6 2019-02-02 23:50:00 They confiscated bump-stocks recently, and that was under Trump. That's a bad precedent. Whether guns can be effectively confiscated is besides the point and doesn't mean it won't be attempted.

My take FWIW is let the politicians ban whatever they want and don't follow the law.
7 2019-02-02 23:48:56 "Decent"- are we ignoring that 8% jump in stocks or..........
8 2019-02-02 23:48:16 i think stocks will fall 6 months to the 2020 election, it's uncertainty that makes the market fluctuate
9 2019-02-02 23:48:06 Nice. Regression to the mean with a drift, yay capitalism, and/or  effect on stocks of post Bretton woods* 
Now % +/- after raise/drop rates by “eras” like post 2007 would be even more lognormal. 

Or any number of things I want to rationalize.
10 2019-02-02 23:46:54 I have some physical gold I might sell and use to trade gold stocks lol.
11 2019-02-02 23:46:51 After March 29th if you are caught speaking any language other than English..you’ll be put in the stocks and flogged by the gammon police #brexitfacts
12 2019-02-02 23:46:32 I hear you. Spend so much time studying and analyzing cannabis stocks I need to branch out and track other sectors
13 2019-02-02 23:46:21 Magi vs. Mango game three was craaaaaazy
Can’t think of another back and forth that was so…it was basically the same two stocks happening three times and then a reversal, but that’s what made it hype
14 2019-02-02 23:46:14 Better invest in Mattel stocks this summer!
15 2019-02-02 23:45:42 Expecting the FA to turn up because your side didn’t... “why always us!”
16 2019-02-02 23:45:12 I’m sure ARMY can buy much more Mattel products than Hyundai’s. Let’s hope those reporting on stocks fall down the rabbit hole when they really start investigating 
17 2019-02-02 23:44:38 Quand je serai a Paris de toute facon personne le saura ptdddr ca va faire des stocks dans les memories de snap et seuleeeement apres mon retour la jvai envoyer mdddr
18 2019-02-02 23:44:14 Is there a metric in traditional finance (shares out, float) you think “circulating supply” should match?  I’ve wondered what the POINT of circulating supply was.  If it’s to enable thinking about crypto like stocks then pairing situations to their traditional analog makes sense.
19 2019-02-03 23:59:40 And got that 5% cashback from my shoes with @acorns! Ask me about @acorns! #investing #stocks

22 2019-02-03 23:56:27 "When pundits say “wait for more clarity”, they really mean “wait for pessimism to subside”, what they are really thinking is “wait until stocks aren’t going down anymore”. The problem: there's never more clarity, & when less pessimism, stocks will already be higher." John Huber
23 2019-02-03 23:54:58 Chance The Rapper & Backstreet Boys Super Bowl Sellout Stocks are literally plummeting right now.

24 2019-02-03 23:54:55 @adam_stocks_ you got yourself one of these?
25 2019-02-03 23:54:18 Marijuana stocks are the new Bitcoin
26 2019-02-03 23:54:14 Stocks
27 2019-02-03 23:53:48 are homie stocks always considered ""bad""?
28 2019-02-03 23:53:43 Rubén, disculpa mi ignorancia. A qué te refieres con defender detrás de los stocks? Muchas gracias. Me encantó tu libro.
29 2019-02-03 23:53:33 Buy stocks in Kleenex tissue..,
30 2019-02-03 23:52:59 Mang0 and S2J are true best friends, giving homie stocks in top 8, so wholesome
31 2019-02-03 23:52:04 tbh I don't really like homie stocks, but if I was playing against a friend in tourney and they SD, I'd homie stock ngl.
32 2019-02-03 23:51:31 Homie stocks in top 8. @C9Mang0 is confident.
33 2019-02-03 23:48:54 @SchaefferOil dealer. But we haven’t found one that stocks it yet.
34 2019-02-03 23:48:29 Jenny's corner only stocks the useful merchandise that will have a home
35 2019-02-03 23:45:52 I dont know much about real estate tbh. But i feel like stocks gives you more breathing room especially as a starter. You decide what/how much you wanna put it in. Plus you get paid every year depending on how high the yield is.
36 2019-02-03 23:44:09 I just discovered that our local liquor store now stocks this quality drop here in Aus!! PS: loved the Aviation cameo in A Simple Favour!!
37 2019-02-03 23:44:01 All I wanna talk about is continuities , and convoluted stories , maybe have a couple debates. I don’t care about stocks or what bills niggas got. I don’t care about insurance etc that is all lame.

41 2019-02-01 23:57:33 So how is President Trump running the country into the ground? Employment: up. Unemployment: down. Stocks: up. North Korea: in talks. Taxes: down. I could go on, but am interested in your answer.
42 2019-02-01 23:56:10 Basis step-up applies to all appreciated assets. There are good reasons for it. Estate is being 'taxed', altho most estates are small enough that no tax is owed. For assets like stocks or jewelry, it's almost necessary, as it may be next to impossible to determine purchase price.
43 2019-02-01 23:55:48 Almost all of Twitter is so bullish they have been buying junk pot stocks again .... I think next few weeks are promising to be rather brutal
44 2019-02-01 23:55:27 My My !
Watch Military Manufacturing Stocks Sore
For the Rich GOP to reap
45 2019-02-01 23:55:19 I was having a heart attack when you got me down by two stocks in one stock
46 2019-02-01 23:54:54 wait when stocks went down you said nothing
47 2019-02-01 23:52:02 I have lost money on my 401k, my stocks are down. Haven't gotten a raise in years but the hot economy is making the rich, richer. Thanks to all of us lower/middle class folks.
48 2019-02-01 23:51:40 Stocks were a bit weak today, despite all this fabulous economic data Having exhausted the sugar rush that was spoonfed to them by their friendly neighborhood Federal Reserve.
49 2019-02-01 23:51:36 Tesla stocks will soar tomorrow because of this acquisition
50 2019-02-01 23:51:20 Y’all, my Nike and Amazon stocks look so good right now.. I’m ready to cash out 
51 2019-02-01 23:50:31 We've just seen the biggest January rise in stocks in the US for 30 years.

Right at the point where every homegrown expert and chartist had thrown in the towel and was in cash telling everyone else to sell.

I hope someone's learnt something from that
52 2019-02-01 23:49:31 You follow a lot of Wes Eden stocks
53 2019-02-01 23:49:20 I'll roll out my old mantra..... Flogging and a day in the stocks.
54 2019-02-01 23:49:10 We still out here throwing away stocks from buffered airdodges 

I shouldnt be too mad though, BBC’s wolf was playing clean after that first game. 

Made a tear through losers after! Would’ve liked to play Wizzrobe, but at least I didnt drown

Let the markets tell you their direction, don’t you try to tell the markets their direction. Sell bounces in a Bear market. Buy dips in a Bull market. The Bear market will end in Bitcoin. The Bull market will end in US stocks. Not yet.
