36 2018-08-14 23:57:14 I can't think of anything usa has done right in the mideast.  Anthropogenic climate change indicates we don't need more oil.  We should give the Kurds the military equipment and go home.
37 2018-08-14 23:57:13 @Oil_Drop as for Mikko, i believe it is too early to judge or assume anything. I watched some of his KHL games and he was outstanding.Will that transfer to NHL remains to be seen. In the meantime i hold judgment until i see firsthand

56 2018-08-14 23:55:59 Right. That looks like what Spezza did. (A 2 OV pick that played his full draft +1 season in the AHL too by the way.) I'm thinking of the service time game they played by using the AHL in his draft +2 season.

58 2018-08-14 23:55:42 It sucks that we are stuck on this greed driven, ecologically destructive and globally impactful suicide mission that you are helping to steer. Denouncing peoples legitimate concerns because of your lucrative relationship supporting the gas and oil industry is really sickening.

71 2018-08-14 23:54:15 @Oil_Drop time will tell on the goalie situation. I am not convinced that the Oilers do not believe in Talbot. I believe they are trying to provide him soneone to push him and also support so he doesn't play 70 games.

85 2018-08-14 23:52:45 For christ sake, that's the last thing they need to do. Not trading RNH is one of the few things Chiarelli got right when he took over and inherited assets that were either core pieces moving forward or valuable trade chips.
86 2018-08-14 23:52:37 It isnt their money. They already stole millions under Bush.  As a  loan to fund that Iraqui war for oil. They never paid it back.Thieves.

90 2018-08-14 23:52:17 Question is will the next rns be a fundraiser. Like you im bag holding but faith in the board here is none existent. They have lied and deceived shareholders over the gas so until things improve im considering what the worst will be

96 2018-08-14 23:51:18 i’ve been growing mine out for like over a year, and when I used castor oil I noticed TONS of little new baby hairs growing! it was crazy, I didn’t think I could grow more hairs than I already had but yeah it’s awesome!
97 2018-08-14 23:51:12 Nope. It would help. Make the country more prosperous. Get off of dictator oil. Even reduce emissions. Free up rail space for other products. Who knew.
98 2018-08-14 23:50:51 ME conflicts are only about oil to the extent that rapidly rising prices are painful at the pump. The security of our homeland has been the primary justification for Afghanistan and Iraq wars, albeit with bad Intel on Iraq.

Or, when buy local hot sauce/oil/creams/liquid stuff, put em in there to protect other belongings
101 2018-08-14 23:49:52 All guessing aside, what I expect the Oilers to do is wait and see if something falls into their lap. If not, they run with Gravel and Bouchard as the 6/7 split to start the season and see how it goes. Also, the Brandon Davidson option is a real possibility.
102 2018-08-14 23:49:43 Olive oil on feta cheese is normal.

106 2018-08-14 23:49:32 I love Davy but realistically he’s a 6/7 on a good team.  Sekera, when healthy, is a legit 2/3.  Oil need to aim higher, much higher than Davidson.  Therein lies the problem...
107 2018-08-14 23:49:30 Won’t ever give you a dime.  I’m about to cut the cord, but will give my money to a company that stands against white supremacy, white terrorism and stands against the violent threats of an unstable snake oil salesman. #fuckalexjones

110 2018-08-14 23:49:03 Is not by saying it but taking proper step to make sure it is been carried out because the same vice-president ordered oil companies to relocate there headquarter to oil producing area and nothing is done.
111 2018-08-14 23:48:52 Well, not 4... but I see your point. By "low oil" I meant the recession in general, which is certainly affecting young workers (men in particular) more than others. Takeaway: we probably shouldn't blame MinWage since we see this in SK too.

147 2018-08-14 23:43:48 that’s strange! they are noncomedogenic & oil free. very odd. would try elta MD UV clear as well. comes in tinted & untinted—great for acneic and sensitive skin.
148 2018-08-14 23:43:48 Lavender oil?
149 2018-08-14 23:43:40 coconut oil can do anything. coconut oil can cut the grass. coconut oil can spay and neuter your pets. coconut oil can bring your dad back.
150 2018-08-14 23:43:35 If you told Todd about the secret ceremonies, mink oil, etc., you might freak him out.
151 2018-08-14 23:43:07 NO, EVERYTHING I WROTE ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY I BELIEVE DEEPLY - they are the bottom feeders of the world IMO. Signing off.
152 2018-08-14 23:42:59 Have you ever tried Nigella's "moonblush" tomatoes. In essence chop you toms, set the oven to as high as it goes, put toms on baking sheet with oil and seasoning, when the oven is at temp, put the toms in, turn it off and leave over night. Sweet and amazing!
153 2018-08-14 23:42:43 Is not just by saying it without action.The same vice-president ordered oil companies to relocate there headquarter to the oil producing area and nothing is done. Politicians are people that want to build bridge where there is no river

157 2018-08-14 23:42:21 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, silver with black vinyl roof and a blue velour interior. Put a CB antenna on the back.

So weak that it spun a tire only once when I drove through an oil slick on a rainy day. But once it got up to speed it floated on the highway.

$1,000 in 1998.
158 2018-08-14 23:42:14 This is yet another reason why the U.S. NEEDS to stop using oil.
159 2018-08-14 23:42:02 Smear the dog in a special oil, bring it to a special dog masseur, let it watch dog porn for 7 days for 4 hours, let it have intercourse with a dog from africa 2 times a day 7 days, go sky diving with the dog, write a fan fiction about your dog and get it a toy hope this helps!
160 2018-08-14 23:41:57 This woman at Kal Tire is furious that the guys at Kal Tire broke a wheel lock, but then also said she hasn’t had an oil change or any service done to her car in A YEAR! Starting to think it’s not Kal Tires fault 
161 2018-08-14 23:41:55 Can someone be a doll & run my car the the car wash & drop it off for an oil change? 
162 2018-08-14 23:41:52 This is something you should try. It worked for me.. Get Pure honey, black seed powder ,garlic powder and Olive oil. Mix them all and consistently be taking a spoonful after meal.
163 2018-08-14 23:41:41 But any surprise? The Saudi's have us by the oil drums. As long as the dollar is de facto tied to oil, we're handcuffed to the Kingdom of Saud.
164 2018-08-14 23:41:36 Water, oil, live-in conditioner
165 2018-08-14 23:41:33 So where’s our oil?
166 2018-08-14 23:41:29 What you're saying is very clear, I just think you're wrong.  Saudi Arabia is not preparing for a world post oil, they are just spending money on something other than prostitutes for once.  And their millennial prince, being a true failson, is throwing money at advertising.
167 2018-08-14 23:41:21 Tariq getting fulla that oil
168 2018-08-14 23:41:19 coconut oil in my hair, black mask on my face & a candle lit bath. Tuesday self care night is in full swing
169 2018-08-14 23:40:59 Don't be like that, lol. I think you are in for a surprise this year when it comes to the Todd / Jesse relationship.
170 2018-08-14 23:40:52 And he can't play in the A off the hop. Is there a loophole that opens up in the spring after lots of Junior service time? I forget what Spezza did.

176 2018-08-14 23:40:05 Keep in mind that the Scandinavian countries are small, relatively culturally homogeneous, and benefited from Marshall Plan aid as well as US extended deterrence.  Sweden could export its way out of a crisis in the way that the US cannot; Denmark and Norway have North Sea oil.
177 2018-08-14 23:40:05 No it was orchestrated to destabilise a regime so that the resources could be controlled. Try telling my friends children it was ill judged to send their parents to fight a war for oil.
178 2018-08-14 23:40:04 見つかって良かったってツイートが見られたから、富田林の留置場から脱走したやつのことかと思ったら違うのか。大阪帰った途端に襲われたらどうしようヤだ。俺のようなか弱い人を襲わないで。
179 2018-08-14 23:39:59 I quit - you care about nothing about anything other than I said something bad about the totally non-empathetic (my words and belief) oil industry. I still BELIEVE what I said, regardless of your writings.
180 2018-08-14 23:39:46 can I just use this here platform to remind people all over the world that the US is shit
181 2018-08-14 23:39:43 But your sugar daddy Putin is dealing oil with them in the Caspian sea. 

Didn't he tell you?

Oh.

182 2018-08-14 23:39:35 How does one go about ordering CBD oil or cream if you don't live in a state that is legal?
183 2018-08-14 23:39:25 This is sound advice. A man may be measured in the majesty of his beard.  May I also suggest a good whiskey scented beard oil. Or bacon perhaps....
184 2018-08-14 23:39:14 Hey Powder Puff PM @JustinTrudeau!  Why don't you impose a gender analysis on ME oil?  That should finish them off!

186 2018-08-14 23:39:08 Yemen doesn't have much oil, the Saudis just don't like the fact that Shiites are there. There used to be an Al Quada group in Yemen, but the Houthi rebels actually defeated them.  Then Saudi Arabia went to war.
187 2018-08-14 23:39:06 Time to diffuse a little peppermint oil and get into this taco situation.
188 2018-08-14 23:39:03 How much money has he been paid, over the years, by the oil and gas industry, to deny his children their future? What’s the going rate for something like that?! His lies and propaganda don’t matter anymore.
189 2018-08-14 23:38:57 coconut oil shampoo changed my life. my hair grew 2 1/2 inches in two months. my hair never grows fast

191 2018-08-14 23:38:43 Leave the Saudi Arabian investment out of the deal.  Why would we want such massive oil interest having stake in this company? It's a deal with the devil

200 2018-08-14 23:37:35 What if the IPO date is a moving target? The Saudis have used the Aramco IPO as a tool to build the oil bull narrative around, while keeping the actual date fluid.  The Kazaks could very easily pick from that play book. If something is 'simple' that's when you should look twice.

Because he’s done something and Mueller is on the case!!  He’s a Snake Oil Salesman and always has been! If you look at his past!!

215 2018-08-14 23:35:13 @realDonaldTrump Trump the nation is suffering from Trump fatigue. Iran is selling oil at cut rate prices, you're being investigated and about to be indicted and now Omarosa will destroy you. Better start a war quick about to go down!

217 2018-08-14 23:34:52 Also, evening primrose oil. It didn’t put me into labor, but it made my body more ready than ever before and helped my labor go faster because I was already dilated. I have friends that swear by the primrose oil plus castor oil but I was way too scared to try the castor oil.

222 2018-08-14 23:34:22 Depends on the return. If it's a band-aid solution in the mould of a Russell, that's a problem. I loved the Russell signing as a UFA b/c it was just $$$ w/ no term. You can't give up assets for that kind of player.

227 2018-08-14 23:33:10 Agreed on Bear. Better off trying to bring back Davidson if need be, or finding a veteran dman somewhere.
228 2018-08-14 23:33:02 I make a similar bread at home and I make a lot of.........tuna fish sandwiches. I also cut it up into chunks and saute it in olive oil until it's crispy to add it to my salads. (This is especially great once it starts to go stale, though sourdough generally keeps longer.)
229 2018-08-14 23:32:56 Yeah... thou who defies oil shall be destroyed.

231 2018-08-14 23:32:47 When capitalism kill people, we are going to say so. If a country drops bombs another country in a war over oil or some other resource, killing innocent people, would you expect us to say nothing about a pursuit of profit resulting in death?

262 2018-08-14 23:29:12 I’d much rather have a Sask Party deficit than an NDP love fest. Don’t forget the terrible 5 years we have experienced as a province in both oil and potash. Nobody complained when things were good. Sorry if that hurts. But I’m not the only one who feels this way.

265 2018-08-14 23:28:59 50mg benadryl, 4mg valium, 5mg thc orally, vaped thc oil all night & often another 5 mg thc around 1-2AM. The last time I slept through the night was in 2001. I get up a minimum of 3 times a night. Also a fan running at all times and often the white noise app as well.
266 2018-08-14 23:28:56 Im not saying Bear is our best option. We should bring in another dman. But this is the Oilers we are talking about. Our only options are a bunch of guys that arent NHL regulars. That is a huge blow.
267 2018-08-14 23:28:43 But it's use in language is about "purity" not "not done it before" 
Think of virgin olive oil or something.

"purity" in humans is about "goodness"
In women it's about not having had dirty sex, and if they have they are "impure" 

It's a dumb term.
It needs to change.

274 2018-08-14 23:28:00 You should look into what “self preservation” means

We’re talking about an economy that is almost entirely built on oil facing a future that is moving away from oil. They want to make sure that they remain players in the global economy after that shift.

This is about money
275 2018-08-14 23:27:45 Yankton rainfall reports range from .03 (!) at the airport to 2.40 (!!!!) at Cotton Oil in downtown Yankton.  That's a bit of a spread. If the official winds up being close to the latter, it's a record ... which is sounding like a broken record.
276 2018-08-14 23:27:44 Waterworld was an amazing film. I saw it twice in theater, something I rarely have done in my entire life. Also, I really want gills, and a diving bell until I can afford them. How did it flop so hard? Was it climate change denial? Big oil? Meh.

278 2018-08-14 23:27:41 Looks bearish for oil. Data readily available. OPEC  production, Rates , trade , uncertainty indices(WTO, OECD, EUI) , IMO 2020  distillate prices, 2nd longest bull mkt in US historyprob of recession , contagion risk . Ripe for trigger/event risk.

284 2018-08-14 23:25:56 Bear is not an NHL regular and putting him in this spot is setting the kid up for failure. On a deep backend he can be a No. 6 who specializes on the PP, that isn't the situation in Edmonton,
285 2018-08-14 23:25:55 When has it ever hurt anyone? He goes there, plays WJC and destroys his competition. Confidence won’t be lacking next year. He struggles here, confidence sags and everyone goes JSchultz on him. You’d hope the team has learned by now.
286 2018-08-14 23:25:47 The old ones weren't fun,  but by the end of last year I had four hoses removed from the block and attached together with ORFS couplers to keep oil in the machine to finish. Had one screw up on a JD loader quicktach as well.
287 2018-08-14 23:25:46 Let’s all remember mayonnaise cakes of WWII. Oil and eggs were rationed but mayonnaise, as a condiment, was not. Naturally creative cooks figured out that you could substitute mayo for the eggs and oil and voila - cake.

289 2018-08-14 23:25:35 Y’all niggas can’t change tires , do oil changes , mount a tv lol WTF ARE YOUUUUU GOOOD FOR !!!!!  I need a handy man  tf a fine one  tf cus roadside cost money 
290 2018-08-14 23:25:08 @KaeElmer I heard on one of your videos that taking unfiltered c60 oil is not recommended if you have kidney issues/ stones. Do you think this applies to doing pulverized c60 topically as well? My wife has kidney issues. I don't think so because the particles are so small?
291 2018-08-14 23:24:52 An example. When I founded NEF (now @BloombergNEF) the oil price was $28. All the economic purists would have added $20 - $40 per barrel. Here we are - we've been to $140 per barrel, we're at $75 per barrel - using more oil than ever. Meanwhile... Elon Musk!
292 2018-08-14 23:24:39 What does that have to do with how he did nothing to actually create economic growth he rode the waves of oil
293 2018-08-14 23:24:28 I can't find my peppermint oil I want to cry. Head is killing me. 
294 2018-08-14 23:24:23 Season them with salt, pepper, and oregano. Douse them in olive oil. Throw them on a cooking sheet, preheat the oven to 400 and throw them in until you get them crispy. Or however you like them
295 2018-08-14 23:24:17 I think it generally refers to carbon 60.  Some kind of purified   nutritional oil that acts an antioxidant.
296 2018-08-14 23:24:16 AMEN!

299 2018-08-14 23:23:56 told my mom about my anxiety and it went well and now she wants to send me CBD oil
300 2018-08-14 23:23:52 Oil pumps going out in my new truck blew my bearings apart Sunday in my front tire on my bike   Bummed
301 2018-08-14 23:23:47 No it doesn't. It's relief for one seaon and nothing more. Also, not real sure why so many are hell-bent on signing Nurse long-term.
302 2018-08-14 23:23:37 No mate, most of us get it. You city fans however are dull as fuck. Small club who got lucky with new owners yet you still can't fill your ground. Probably didn't support city till the oil money came.
303 2018-08-14 23:23:33 It is, just with garlic or other flavorings and olive oil base vs soybean oil. But people are less upset by me slathering aioli on my fries for some reason. HATERS.
304 2018-08-14 23:23:18 Hey y’all since I haven’t been able to find a job . If you need work done on your car for example changing your oil ,washing it ,cleaning it HMU 
I’ll work on your car for 20 bucks and i can give your car a full detail with a full wax for just 20 bucks. Pt.1
305 2018-08-14 23:23:17 Oil has utility. It's not necessary that you will use the oil (so neither is its delivery) only that it is scarce so the real user offers you smth in order to get it from you. If it's getting scanter in time, you are storing value by owning the rights to trade it later
306 2018-08-14 23:23:07 have you tried using coconut oil?
307 2018-08-14 23:23:01 Right. It's pretty easy to setup your team so that an 18yo 1st rounder can walk on to it. It isn't really proof of anything. The team and fans should have learned that by now.
308 2018-08-14 23:23:00 うん！
309 2018-08-14 23:22:53 Versatile dabbables by Select Oil are great for dabbing, for use to twax blunts or joints, or for cooking at home. Now $5 off!
310 2018-08-14 23:22:39 I be feeling so generous when Logan looks sad or annoyed telling him all about how ima give him an oil massage later , then when we get home he’ll lay down talking about “ whatsup with that massage “ ....

-mix together
-place mixture on lips 
-longer left on=bigger lips
314 2018-08-14 23:21:58 Yeah Coconut oil was trash all around for me I don’t recommend it to anyone really
315 2018-08-14 23:21:42 been procrastinating making that homemade face scrub even tho it’s just like olive oil and sugar and i’m literally in the kitchen like most day wth
316 2018-08-14 23:21:28 Does anybody out there remember an Andy Jones bit on WGB where he's fantasizing about oil..."(ile) all over me body!"? Set in a supermarket? Asking for a friend. @marywalsh11
317 2018-08-14 23:21:22 You didnt get it.

The oil companies have all the contracts for all the major fields until into expiry, and anyway they will be worthless in a generation. Not 50 or 100yrs .

So youre gambling on a resource which is running out and being superceded. Typical snp strategy

320 2018-08-14 23:20:50 Meh,it's part of our 21st century #Human experience.Better to re-design so it isn't such an energy guzzler,then it would be OK, as long as energy is sustainable and non-polluting.Which it can be,but for the feckin #Oil investments.Why don't we #Humans prove it? I think we will.
321 2018-08-14 23:20:48 @Sarmisegetuza  Crude Oil is bearish with a trading-range, Spike & Channel, and measured-move on the chart this evening…
The trading-range tells me to sell the high, buy the low, and avoid the middle, and with price collapsing off the highs, we know exactly where the bears...
322 2018-08-14 23:20:41 Spent bloody ages getting my car as level as possible on the drive so I could check the oil in the morning... Then Emily goes and moves it. Dick 
323 2018-08-14 23:20:38 Same here. Do people already forget about Ethan Bear? Gryba buyout looks worse now too
324 2018-08-14 23:20:17 It's not a matter of whether or not he can make the team but will he be capable of the ask and still develop.
325 2018-08-14 23:20:08 I was driving home had to get an oil change and eat dinner. Can’t tweet and drive
326 2018-08-14 23:20:08 Are you completely deluded? Coal is a pure element compared to oil which is ripe with carcinogens and toxins. The Oil industry demonized coal to increase profits because they knew coal was more energy efficient

That long term fake news is the only reason coal was never developed
327 2018-08-14 23:19:57 More than enough land is being cultivated. All existing forest needs to be protected.

328 2018-08-14 23:19:56 I made the thc oil and I just put it on the pan to make the eggs! Lol
329 2018-08-14 23:19:53 Thing is I do so well with stir fry and pan frying, but these damned chicken thighs just looked awful and still stuck to the damned pan after I used olive oil even. like WTH chicken c'mon!
330 2018-08-14 23:19:50 The miracle child strikes again! 22nd DVT blood clot to my surgically implanted IV access! 2 attempts at stroke blasting medication and then all of a sudden I guess it was the Coumadin I took and God and the Rick Simpson Oil yes I'm baked I am alive!

332 2018-08-14 23:19:37 they're both 99% oil and eggs! aioli has garlic, mayo usually has a hit of acid.
333 2018-08-14 23:19:27 remember in fast and furious 1 when those chinese mfs had that dude drowning in motor oil lmaoooo
334 2018-08-14 23:19:25 If the Oilers get extra cap space because of this injury then does it allow them to pay Nurse a little more and go long term contract instead of bridge?

343 2018-08-14 23:18:25 Saudi Arabia attacked us on 9-11 but we're helping them kill children? Is it because we need their oil? Why do we have to be beholden to them? Why aren't we trying to make their oil useless thru clean energy?
344 2018-08-14 23:18:01 I’ve been using tinted Garnier BB cream for ages (as foundation) and it’s incredible, oil free and weightless and so so cheap (light is dark enough)xx
345 2018-08-14 23:17:56 aioli isn't great BUT aioli is made with olive oil and garlic! That is not the same as canola oil mixed with eggs.
346 2018-08-14 23:17:47 Oil not good oh no no no
347 2018-08-14 23:17:46 #real DonaldTrump-I thought Saudi Arabia was  very rich country so why did we give them $110 billion dollars?  We do not get much oil from them nowadays so we must b buying their affections.  U seem 2 freely giveaway our money 2 anyone but us.

352 2018-08-14 23:16:42 Jeez. I haven't seen any evidence to the claim that cannabis oil cures cancer. I don't know if it exists because it is not published anywhere & you can't even give me a single link. You are all over the place here. Focus on what I asked. It's simple. 1/
353 2018-08-14 23:16:30 おはようございます(*^^*)
354 2018-08-14 23:16:03 Make the actual price of our oil... By golly that does seem logical. Should build another pipeline to the Atlantic ocean as well. That'd create a lot of jobs but those folks living off our tax dollars would protest that too.
355 2018-08-14 23:16:02 Do I have any local essential oil ladies?! I’m in north Phoenix area! Pm me please

I would like to see it Nationalized so Canada keeps the profit

366 2018-08-14 23:14:32 You’re still at stoning and beheading age boo. You need about 300 years to get to hacking people’s elections. By that point, tech and innovation would make oil obsolete. you’ll be dirt poor emigrating elsewhere to avoid being consumed by the sun. Chill.

374 2018-08-14 23:13:20 These type of strains seem to make co2 oil that taste kinda bad due to over representation beta caryophyllene, humulene and nerolidol retention in extracts, I guess they can keep’em

383 2018-08-14 23:11:56 You’re blending oil into vinegar, lemon juice, or some other acid when you make mayo.
384 2018-08-14 23:11:54 Lol. Changing oil with someone is gonna be a date night for me. Hehe.
385 2018-08-14 23:11:47 ~Exfoliating Lips
-use honey, sugar, any olive or coconut oil, (whatever you prefer) and mix in a small bowl
-rub the mixture gently on lips
-after about a minute, rinse off with warm water and apply lip balm
386 2018-08-14 23:11:42 Oil or rubbing alcohol. Otherwise treat it as a knotted mess and use tons of conditioner and brush it out
387 2018-08-14 23:11:39 Olive oil is the best. Nice and slippery and tastes great.
388 2018-08-14 23:11:29 No. I'm more offended by the idea that people can't share ideas, inspire other ppl's expression, or alter concepts. Truly, I'm directly apart of many cultures: psychedelics, flow arts, oil painting...I'm not offended when those elements are used in different spaces.
389 2018-08-14 23:11:12 Mate from time my car turned off because there was no water or oili shouldn’t be allowed to drive
390 2018-08-14 23:11:09 What #Wilko should have asked you Sammy, is what paint is it? I’m guessing it’s vinyl paint (silk emulsion) which is oil based & not water based (matt emulsion). Is that correct?

398 2018-08-14 23:10:21 Not at all but the problem with simply going that route, is they could be left holding the bag. It's certainly a solid second option to have.
399 2018-08-14 23:10:07 My hair loves coconut oil
400 2018-08-14 23:09:32 Maybe skin u x sesuai dgn rose oil. I sensitive skin x sesuai ngan rose oil
401 2018-08-14 23:09:28 Went in the Lexus dealership for an oil change. Them mf’s got me for $1200 
402 2018-08-14 23:09:21 today prices crude oil 4707 rupees very cheap rate 1 barel 172 litr why not cheap petrol prices on all state
403 2018-08-14 23:09:19 Same way we in Canada have some of the worlds largest oil reserves but buy oil from 3rd world backward countries. Inept leadership bent on globalization.
404 2018-08-14 23:09:18 I’ve been using tea tree oil and it’s calmed right down! It’s amazing stuff!
405 2018-08-14 23:08:56 Man I’d give anything for a crispy, MSG filled chick Fil a sandwich with waffle fries drenched in peanut oil fresh out the oven
406 2018-08-14 23:08:48 Not at all. The history of extreme muslims jihad and islam trying to take over the world predates oil. Not saying your point is invalid. There are many muslim men creating havoc in other countries rather than advancing their own and looking after their woman and children
407 2018-08-14 23:08:40 Oil in his ass man better hope he doesn't play dumb drunk party games
408 2018-08-14 23:08:36 How about getting a pipeline from Alberta to the East coast so built so we don't have to rely on the Saudis oil?   Why don't you talk about that?
409 2018-08-14 23:08:16 What in the coconut oil

412 2018-08-14 23:07:57 I swear my uncle loves me he’s always giving me oil pens 
413 2018-08-14 23:07:28 O dear, apparently you have figured out what the word "asshole" means but not much more. Your point is plainly stupid, if push comes to shove we don't need Saudis oil to run our cars at all.

416 2018-08-14 23:07:06 In ND USA, there is a three person panel that decides penalties and fines for oil companies that have oil spills. The companies only have to pay 10% if they promise not to do it again.
417 2018-08-14 23:06:59 @Divascalp I love that the oil place responded to you 
418 2018-08-14 23:06:53 Bio oil is supposed to be really good for that, unless your skin is already quite oily.

422 2018-08-14 23:06:18 Also I’m upset lmao wtf I was supposed to get my oil before I leave but I guess I’ll have to settle for not being smacked... again.

428 2018-08-14 23:05:40 Exactly reason @Incindia should not rule us if you cant get basic economics. The drop is due to spillover from the oil prices and turkiish lira. Not all @BJP4India
429 2018-08-14 23:05:29 Agreed. Canada should act with integrity. Repeat the UN OHCHR message in the press & social media. Cancel the personnel carriers - no refunds. Buy oil from Canadian sources. Tell Saudis Canada is sorry for the grief their government is causing them. Tell bin Salman to shove it.
430 2018-08-14 23:05:25 @TheBigVitoBrand @bWoStevie hey guys. Heard omega 3s and fish oil are good for your joint pains and focussing? Is this true. My body is falling apart and my knees are always killing me. I know u guys r really knowledgeable about health & fitness.

433 2018-08-14 23:05:14 Never state, it's about Iraqi government..
"Kurdistan considered as the most corrupted part of Iraq. According to Kurdish lawmakers and leaked documents billions of dollars are missing from Iraqi Kurdistan’s oil revenues.

435 2018-08-14 23:05:03 It's all about supply, demand and desperation. Just go ask New Jersey how effectively things can turnout when the latter is involved.
436 2018-08-14 23:04:36 Norway does not fund it's social programs with oil money. It does it through high taxes. The oil money sits pretty much untouched.

But if they did, that certainly would be comforting for opponents of social programs!
437 2018-08-14 23:04:33 With a nat gas rig count <200 I think most if not all of that increase is associated/solution gas from oil exploration and production. Is my thinking correct here @BrynneKKelly ?
438 2018-08-14 23:04:29 todavía no quebró el canal alcista pero falta poco, creo que se la pone con el quiebre del oil por debajo de 66,50

Get a grip. And comprehension lessons. Then go read the reports on the 30+ legal challenges that were ruled in favour of KM.

442 2018-08-14 23:04:07 Clearly there aren't, but the vultures in the media love to make up this kind of crap because they know how excitable our fan base is and also to keep pouring oil on the banter fire.
443 2018-08-14 23:04:03 the front month Brent crude oil contract has been caught in a $72 a barrel to $75 a barrel range in a tug of war” between short-term bearish factors and the medium-term bullish impact of Iran sanctions due to kick in on Nov. 4

445 2018-08-14 23:03:56 I like using garlic powder, ginger powder and soy sauce to flavour it. Heat oil, throw in 1 teaspoon of powder each and then the soy sauce and tofu, fry, stirring frequently for five minutes. Important to drain tofu on paper towels first, pressing down to get as much water out

So huge % increase

452 2018-08-14 23:02:49 Y’all love to use these incidents to push your rhetoric. It’s despicable. To think every immigrant is cut from the same cloth is about as smart as believing oil and gas are the best energy source for the longevity of the planet. Y’all is whack.

457 2018-08-14 23:02:37 To a degree that is true but on the other hand, they also like to give veteran guys more than they should and on long term deals. It truly is the "worst" of both worlds.

Take it 1.5hrs before I need to be asleep for best results re oil. A 1:1 during the day for PTSD related panic attacks works 2.

501 2018-08-14 22:58:05 My gf is from belgium and she was shocked how i use olive oil on everything

- Steak

- on top of feta cheese

- on olives

bread with olive oil is a great snack. Few know this.
502 2018-08-14 22:57:52 It is good, especially either roasted (like big chips in olive oil) or baked as a whole, or split in two & used as a side vegie or stuffed / covered in cheese/ratatouile etc. Lovely!
503 2018-08-14 22:57:46 Ariah may take after her great grandma ,she was an accomplished artist. When we were little that was the way she supplimented her income by selling her oil painting.
504 2018-08-14 22:57:29 And that with gasoline production low due to oil storage maxed out. Oil futures have remained stagnant. GM and Ford both going electric in 2022 and 2025. Gouging by the Kochs.
505 2018-08-14 22:57:23 Hope you’re ready for non-stop protesting where ever you go. Majority of coastal residents don’t want KM. A spill would destroy the environment, lives, and our economy. You’ve sold us out to Texan oil tycoons. You’re no son of this Coast.
506 2018-08-14 22:57:22 Does UK foreign policy dictate and promote terrorism? Saudis are murdering scum... just goes to show if you have money you can do what you like.. we need Saudi oil so lets support their genocide.. what happened to the morality of war?
507 2018-08-14 22:57:09 True for sure, but a majority of Canucks fans still ride success of ‘07-11. Oil haven’t been relevant since ‘06, & that team just got hot at the right time.

511 2018-08-14 22:56:50 They suffer from the notion that they are working for the greater good, and whatever action they take, however immoral in isolation is moral in its wider utility - the ends justify the means.  

And thats about as polite as I can be about the lying fucking snake oil bastards.

513 2018-08-14 22:56:45 True, Qatar, etc are very wealthy, largely due to oil and gas. Raw wealth is one measure of success, but not the most satisfying. Given the dryness of the region, for example, the success of agriculture in Israel is welcome. Saudi Arabia is de-salinating seawater, also welcome.

525 2018-08-14 22:54:53 Spiegel is honest about why they oppose the sanctions: because crisis in Iran will send waves of immigrants and THAT is contrary to European security interests.

542 2018-08-14 22:53:27 Make that oil money do something useful for a change. If it builds EVs and energy storage then it’s a worthy investment. If the USA govt. won’t subsidize solar and EVs like it does for petroleum dollar for dollar, then nobody has a leg to stand on complaining about Saudi $.

555 2018-08-14 22:52:05 Political people are often eager to put "humanity" on trial for its crimes, as if to determine whether or not every individual human being deserves to be cooked alive and tortured with scarcity because of the actions of oil executives and robber barons.

561 2018-08-14 22:51:23 Oil have had 5 1st overall picks, a current generational talent, and the people they employ continue to fuck it all up. Canucks haven’t had as long of an opportunity to fuck it all up lol
562 2018-08-14 22:51:19 Although that's still in lab phases. I have started taking copaiba oil which is similar in effect to CBD oil, it contains cannabinoids but isn't illegal. I've come off tramadol but still on the pregablin. Much more awake without the 8 tramadol a day that I was taking!
563 2018-08-14 22:50:49 I’m about to ditch candles and get a essential oil diffuser

567 2018-08-14 22:50:17 Exactly they don't know it's deeper than what they think it's not to protect AmeriKKKa they fighting for oil and money that's it. Why would we have to send troops other places to protect AmeriKKKa?  If they wanna protect they can do it here not in another country killing kids
568 2018-08-14 22:50:16 Wait till him hear bout using butter as a substitute for oil.
569 2018-08-14 22:49:57 God forbid a tanker moves through those polluted waters to EXPORT Canadian oil to international markets

572 2018-08-14 22:49:21 I would support fracking in NY if, it can be done without harming the water table.
 I believe drilling for  oil &, most business can be conducted without  harming the environment but unethical corporations only care about profit  & take short cuts. 
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs
573 2018-08-14 22:49:17 What they didn't want to litigate was the verifiable lie about the amount of oil. If someone has verifiable proof that you lied to investors, you settle. That doesn't mean that this consent order alters any analysis of whether air drops or bounties effect security status.
574 2018-08-14 22:49:13 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
575 2018-08-14 22:48:53 No, you do think Scotland is uniquely crap. You say we we couldn't survive without England. How does Ireland manage to have higher average wages and better pensions than us without our natural resources? We have far larger seas (fishing) more oil, more renewable energy. How?
576 2018-08-14 22:48:19 Why you got to be so purty?
577 2018-08-14 22:48:15 Reminds me of a 24-egg omelette my mom tried to cook over an oil stove during a power outage. She may be still working on it.

581 2018-08-14 22:47:55 You forgot bacon and jalapeños for the sandwich.
582 2018-08-14 22:47:53 Lmaooo she’ll check and change the oil in the morning if it was necessary.

Hebrews 1:9 TPT
584 2018-08-14 22:47:36 There's a whole long history behind that one. By 1940, America and her allies had a trade embargo in place which cut off 90% of Japanese oil imports. By July 1941 is was almost 100%. The feeling in Japan was either attack the US or lose their foothold in China.

588 2018-08-14 22:47:23 @chevrolet Why no transmission dipstick? Is that a way for dealers to get money out of consumers?Not right. Also tube for oil fill going through the engine cover? I believe I have to add a quart every few weeks. No burning. Fuel gauge out. 1st car I’ve owned.
589 2018-08-14 22:47:12 Same geography problem that has plagued Ontonagon for so long. If you happen to be situated six hours on two-lane roads from the nearest city, you'd best have something (oil, minerals, food) you can pull out of the ground and someone willing to pay for it.

592 2018-08-14 22:46:50 You mean GOYA anointing oil? 
593 2018-08-14 22:46:43 Emma’s mom sends me essential oil articles and it’s AWESOME.

595 2018-08-14 22:46:26 this is fair but its also a completely bankrupt argument to say that the ussr or china example as the "only" way communism can happen. we see the oil companies fruit companies and the East India Trading Company and you don't indict all of capitalism for those.

605 2018-08-14 22:45:24 Dudes change their oil every 5 years and wonder why their cars keep blowing up 
606 2018-08-14 22:45:15 Harper had no finically plan for Canada he got lucky oil was so lucrative for so long. He did nothing to set us up after the oil boom
607 2018-08-14 22:45:06 Yikes!!!!!!! I only use a few drops of oil and tons of water lol
608 2018-08-14 22:44:51 As a shetlander for years don't include us in your independence nonsense. Orkney and the western isles stand with us too.

613 2018-08-14 22:44:25 Remaining oil resources can provide about 150 years of supply at current demand
614 2018-08-14 22:44:10 No it hasn’t, oil has funded Westminster for 30 years. The only region benefiting from oil has been London and South East England.

North America swings to a net exporter as shale growth continues

Latin America exports increase from added deepwater, oil sands and 
tight oil supplies

The Middle East and Russia/Caspian remain major oil exporters to 2040, and Africa shifts to an importer

631 2018-08-14 22:42:25 And yet you've have not provided a single link to this research that proves that cannabis oil cures cancer. No, it isn't good enough for me. It is incumbent on those who make the claim to provide the evidence. You clearly have trouble understanding this basic principle.
632 2018-08-14 22:42:13 @CFAMMcan Looks like @tilray is back with high #THC oil and high thc flowers too (high flowers - get it?!)! What a relief! I hope it doesn't happen too often or again.  Another reason #MedicalCannabis deserves a DIN!
633 2018-08-14 22:42:11 would greatly appreciate if someone could come over and put coconut oil in my hair, take off my makeup and feed me ice cream thnx
634 2018-08-14 22:42:06 Oh, that guy is probably out there. He just hasn’t gotten around to trolling you yet. Likely too busy calling @markbspiegel an oil paid monkey Neanderthal moron who just can’t see Elon’s vision.

637 2018-08-14 22:41:58 Technology enables growth in supply from tight oil and natural gas liquids, together reaching nearly 30 percent of global supply by 2040. Combined with growth in oil sands, energy markets shift, and North America becomes a net exporter.
638 2018-08-14 22:41:53 Clove oil!!!! It works wonders for dry sockets.
639 2018-08-14 22:41:50 Shave with warm water shaving cream and moisturize with baby oil or coconut oil :)
640 2018-08-14 22:41:49 I would normally agree with this but most condoms are lubricated with oil based lubes that can mess up silicone toys. (I think) I use only water based lube with my toys because those mfs were expensive and I wanna keep them good.
641 2018-08-14 22:41:46 I’m old enough to remember those Snake Oil salesmen who would come round....they captivated me, until the sheriff ran him out of town?
642 2018-08-14 22:41:35 There are many intelligent people here in the US who can not grasp the fact that our government is so corrupt that it would let Israel stage a terrorist attack for its own benefit and the benefit of a few oil executives and bankers.

646 2018-08-14 22:41:06 Oil and natural gas continue to supply about 55 percent of the world’s energy needs through 2040

656 2018-08-14 22:40:13 If only this country could give Native Americans the respect they deserve and not still be treating them like crap in 2018, digging up sacred land for more leaky oil pipelines. That isn't the behavior of a grateful nation.

660 2018-08-14 22:39:54 Interesting cause I recently started to think “if Italian tanks and weapons weren’t gonna cut it why not he Germans send their tanks and weapons since they have the industry, and make gains for the African oil fields to sustain it.
661 2018-08-14 22:39:54 No, this is what extreme and illegal US sanctions bring. Venezuela has been shut out of the international financial system by the US. 

Why? Because Venezuela has the single largest oil reserves in the world. Same story as always.
662 2018-08-14 22:39:46 A bad sign of upcoming trouble if you aren't Utd or an oil club is looking to replace en masse practically the entire starting XI within 2-3 years. We likely need a couple of CBs if Holding/Chambers don't step up, a LB, the whole attack & 1-2 midfielders if Ramsey doesn't sign up
663 2018-08-14 22:39:33 Would gas and oil be there if there were more than one family involved in NZ?
664 2018-08-14 22:39:13 sad cause I live an hour away :/ pour out some oil and wine for me
665 2018-08-14 22:39:10 If its me. Im calling Ottawa for Erik Karlsson.
666 2018-08-14 22:39:05 Too little too late. Your treatment of women and political dissidents is barbaric. If it doesn't change before the world stops needing your oil, your whole kingdom will be embargoed and isolated and impoverished.
667 2018-08-14 22:38:54 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.

It is also under heavy US sanctions, banning foreign trade, banning access to intl financial system, banning access to credit and bond sales. Venezuela cannot function because of the US.

...but hurr durr, it must be socialism
668 2018-08-14 22:38:52 AZ with its oil export and open borders have a GDP per capital of only 8% higher than AR while AR don’t have oil and open borders.  This is a strong indication of mismanagement of economy by AZ government.
669 2018-08-14 22:38:51 @PreetBharara No surprise, most snake oil salesmen
usually have a cadre of clowns around them to attract a crowd and get in on the swindle.
670 2018-08-14 22:38:38 oil - $10

671 2018-08-14 22:38:28 Congratulations. The reputation of the school internationally has been good. In the nation, it fell when NMSU was following Texas A&M and the oil industry.

683 2018-08-14 22:37:44 Did you get all this through thin air? You can’t even sell out all your seats, it all started with Arab oil money (not denying how well they run your club after your bought success)
684 2018-08-14 22:37:41 How’s the oil business in Deir ez-Zor?
Pipes are working?
685 2018-08-14 22:37:20 It’s always easy for them to predict after the fact. I’d like to hear them come out the day before, or even morning of, & state that Gold, Silver, Platinum, will fall today, Oil will rise, & stocks will set record highs..Amazing though, after the fact, they all have explanations
686 2018-08-14 22:37:19 Like, that's a hat for a badass oil rig guy, or a ranch hand.
687 2018-08-14 22:37:18 Hot oil will stop that

696 2018-08-14 22:36:26 what she says is true and we can say even more about ANC like who sold county to foreigners, who gave us Zuma and the sheep, who sold our oil reserves, who gave us VAT hike, who gave us petrol increases, who bankrupted the SOE's...
697 2018-08-14 22:36:16 yeah!! you could also try essential oil or like just the smell of the tea i guess?? i’m not a big fan either tbh but it helps my migraines a bit
698 2018-08-14 22:35:46 Thanks mate! I’m still six years off that; the Oil of Olay mustn’t be doing what it says on the tin..

You did ask me to change the oil in your car once  ... 

People are dramatic and dumb you've never asked for anything

703 2018-08-14 22:35:06 @SecretaryZinke clearly doesn’t understand how environment works.. skipped all of the required science / environment classes needed to comprehend the ecosystem stability. He is right about one thing: environmental terrorists (coal, oil, gas) are responsible for a huge chunk of

707 2018-08-14 22:34:39 Oh da oil and Farcebook. Gotcha. Thanks. I'm more of an herbalist than an oiler lol. Quit Farcebook coupla yrs ago. All my fam and friends have my contact info so I'm good on the keep in touchy thing. Never cared about reading where a cuz had a dustup at work and trivial chit.

709 2018-08-14 22:34:33 It is ridiculous to have 91 political parties  when the majority of Nigerian can't  named 25 of those parties.  INEC should have work hard to harmonize manifesto to carter for poverty  stricken populous nation despite the oil.
710 2018-08-14 22:34:32 Is would prefer all investment be in wind and solar (and hydro/geothermal). Keep nuclear around until all coal, oil and gas is gone, but don't invest billions in new plants.

712 2018-08-14 22:34:24 Also they MUST be Yukon Gold potatoes or I have no association with your decision.

Cut into frites, sprinkle in olive oil, micro high for x-1 number of original potatoes, shake with chopped fresh thyme and rosemary and bake at 425F, until either a miracle or a disaster occurs.

715 2018-08-14 22:33:53 Unless it was a planned team outing, I guarantee you it was due to lack of interest. We hear stories all the time about how little many of today's baseball players know about the game's history. In fact, I'm surprised half made the trip.

718 2018-08-14 22:33:28 I get that... personally I blasted Tesla over its govt subsidies, false promotion and snake oil salesmen pitch on solar. 

Pharma is huge and most don’t have intricate knowledge of the industry. I know ehr software well, but limited to that

720 2018-08-14 22:33:25 Probably all the fucking snake oil salesmen that earn a living lying for tobacco control in the name of "science"
721 2018-08-14 22:33:18 The difference is one of the reasons oil rich socialist countries are struggling is because China trapped them into perpetual debt and adjustable interest rate loans that they can never pay back, seized ownership of their assets and made them puppet states financially.
722 2018-08-14 22:33:17 wow.. I use only real butter.. the rest, as much as they may be healthy.. I do not go there. My main cooking oil is Cold Press Coconut oil, Ghee at times n real butter only fresh on my Black Chia biscuit that I need to make again.
723 2018-08-14 22:33:08 —exfoliate
2-3 times a week you should exfoliate your skin. Exfoliating is good for removing any dead skin you may have and buff the skin back into good condition. Once all the dirt, oil build-up and dead cross are removed it’ll leaving your skin feeling baby soft!
724 2018-08-14 22:32:23 I raise you a small bag of cooking oil...Big Gil.

738 2018-08-14 22:30:48 Yes! Tanks are effective until they run low on fuel, oil, spare parts, ammunition and (for the crews) food and water. Deny the enemy any of these, like the Typhoons did, and it’s practically game over. Let alone the psychological effect that your back-up is being decimated!
739 2018-08-14 22:30:44 Agreed.  This is another reason why we need to transfer to a Green Renewable Energy grid because doing that to Saudi Arabia would put our oil trading with them in jeopardy, potentially leading to the crash of the U.S. Dollar.  So, we need THE HYDRODOLLAR SYSTEM!

744 2018-08-14 22:30:19 I'm getting my oil changed and the 40-something year old lady next to me didn't know how to pop her hood. Like I didn't the first time but I figured it out in 2 seconds and I'm also a baby child and this is my first car. So like. Lady wtf.
745 2018-08-14 22:30:19 I'm amazed how a country so rich in oil reserves still remains in a 3rd world status...While allowing China, European Nations, and even America to fly over and drain it of its oil and not making up for it in royalties....

759 2018-08-14 22:28:30 Really hoping this chicken tastes as good as it smells.  On the fly made a marinade with random stuff in the house to clean out the fridge: lime, olive oil, onions, green chiles, cilantro, cumin, pepper and salt.

760 2018-08-14 22:28:11 My car drives so much different after an oil change. 
761 2018-08-14 22:28:07 Listen. Everyone needs to experience a manicure. Getting oil massages into ur hands & then rubbed down with a hot towel is magical.
762 2018-08-14 22:27:59 i just dropped more than half a grand on parking for the year... this lot better be paved with gold and have free oil changes or somethin’
763 2018-08-14 22:27:39 What is a good spice additive when sambal chili paste and sriracha aren’t spicy enough??? Hot oil??? Asking for a friend 
764 2018-08-14 22:27:27 @DNC I unsubscribed to your emails.  I am not happy about your decision to take corporate big oil money. It was unnecessary and short sighte of you. I will give to individual candidates instead.
765 2018-08-14 22:27:16 It might cost jobs in the oil industry but create jobs in the new energy industry. Someone would have to build the zero point energy units, install them, retrofit them in existing vehicles, build wireless energy transmission systems, etc.

769 2018-08-14 22:26:43 Pharma hemp has expertly answered your question and from what I heard I concur. If you like sweets I can attest (I was a product tester ) that chocolate mints containing oil works very well also. Taste like After 8’s. I say anything besides smoking, use what you like best

773 2018-08-14 22:26:20 Miracle Whip blows. Growing up, I always wondered why my father's hamburgers never tasted as good as McDonald's, Burger King, or even other people's hamburgers, and it's because he overcooked and pressed all the juice out of them, and used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.

778 2018-08-14 22:25:53 I don't want them to condemn it because it'd just reek of hypocrisy. America and the UK (my country) have bombed their own fair share of children in the name of oil- wait, I mean freedom, so they don't really have a leg to stand on.

You know, like everyone else has to do. Cannabis oil wouldn't be the most controversial product ever to be tested. 2/

805 2018-08-14 22:22:39 Exactly. We have numerous suppressed patents that withdraw energy from the quantum vacuum. Big oil has suppressed every one, either by buying out the patent or strong arming the inventor.

812 2018-08-14 22:21:49 The thing is, us #Humans need to stop our addiction to that liquid gold, aka #Oil. Don't see much evidence of it so far. Eg. Car companies still building and advertising petroleum (#Oil) driven cars. #Plastic and #Textile production from #Oil another eg.
813 2018-08-14 22:21:46 Oil Barrels can have an explosive impact on the narrative. Really focus the mind ;-)   Thanks on the art style. We're really trying to capture the feel of some of the classic miltary art styles (oil paintings etc)

840 2018-08-14 22:16:28 Great figure. was the employment rate much higher in 2013 before the oil prices crashed? to my eyes looks like a secular trend towards lower youth employment (gaming?)
841 2018-08-14 22:16:24 I used marcuja oil and I feel and smell gross lol
842 2018-08-14 22:16:14 Walmart taking too long for my oil change and these tires 
843 2018-08-14 22:16:06 Clove oil is amazing for toothache until it accidentally lands on your tongue 
844 2018-08-14 22:15:58 It would give you acne if you put it on your face like coconut oil is a huge no no that people do but if it works for you then keep it
845 2018-08-14 22:15:57 Haan fry kar k garam oil ap k moun m
846 2018-08-14 22:15:46 I disagree, but not with alfredo or olive oil (with garlic) - just that bolognese is good, and meat sauce is nice. You just need to work it a bit. What comes out of a jar is never going to be all that good, though. Needs some love.
847 2018-08-14 22:15:40 They're local to me. I got mine from their store, that and my liberal tears gun oil. 
848 2018-08-14 22:15:28 Was anyone else yelling "Butter" or "Coconut oil!" ?

850 2018-08-14 22:15:21 Because,amazingly,what we see on our roads,everyday are oil tankers causing huge traffic jams because of bad roads. Oil is the most important consideration when discussing Nigeria n devpt
851 2018-08-14 22:15:18 Erm, it's not just them. Ever heard of the #SuezCanal? Loads of #Oil and shipping for us western consumers  goes through there.
852 2018-08-14 22:15:03 A lot of you hoes need to get left melting in a oil drum but this tea is delicious
853 2018-08-14 22:15:03 We are rude, crude and will curse like a sailor.  But we never fucked anyone against their will nor have we swindled millions of dollars entrusted to us by gullible people looking for miracles to cure their worldly aches with heavenly snake oil.  #atheists #Heathens

855 2018-08-14 22:14:59 Thousand of gas flares around the world at oil production sites burn approximately 140billion cubic meters of natural gas annually, which allows over 300million tons of CO2 emission to the atmosphere.

856 2018-08-14 22:14:54 Meh.  Oil, gas and coal is the way to go people say... frack away (and kill the )
857 2018-08-14 22:14:52 I love it. I use to live in The Woodlands a few years back. I’m here four or five times a year for oil and gas expos. I miss the area.
858 2018-08-14 22:14:50 New tires and an oil change 
859 2018-08-14 22:14:46 I’m putting castor oil in my hair !!
860 2018-08-14 22:14:32 No but demanding the admin enforce sanctions, approving additional money to secure our elections would be a nice start. Texas was one of 7 States with verified intrusion, it wasn't just memes and social media man.
861 2018-08-14 22:14:29 That makes you dangerous and is the reason you are not taken seriously. Someone claimed that cannabis oil cured cancer & I asked for the proof. Because without robust evidence, this is irresponsible. You jumped of your own accord. 1/
862 2018-08-14 22:14:28 You're sugaring and vinegaring it. The kick is sugar. That's most of why ketchup is ketchup. It's flavored, vinegar'ed tomato paste thinned with oil.

Use cinnamon. Use pepper. Use nicely sweated or browned onion. Use wine, that's important.

But... not... ketchup...
863 2018-08-14 22:14:26 And in both Venezuela and Cuba NOTHING impedes them from trading from anywhere else in the world, AND YET in the case of Venezuela MOST of the paid oil it exports is bought by the US, so MOST of the foreign currency it receives comes from the US, so the "sanctions" excuse is moot
864 2018-08-14 22:14:24 I am reading. I'm trying to figure this out. Your stance is you can boycott the NFL because you don't like them kneeling, but social media platforms  are not allowed to boycott hosting lead tainted snake oil salesman alex... because it's not allowing him freedom of speech?

874 2018-08-14 22:13:18 The returns to scale of the web business are huge. Being massive gives you vast power in web search/etail/social. But then, being huge in oil in the 20s was also powerful. Strange to think that Standard Oil would have been the first trillion $ company if it hadn't been busted up.

879 2018-08-14 22:12:52 Yes but don't assume it was due to lack of interest! Some take on extra work & some have treatments etc
880 2018-08-14 22:12:49 You fool, Energy East wasn’t about Canadians refining and using our own oil! It was about rip and ship offshore!
881 2018-08-14 22:12:46 Look forward to tasting the olive oil. Look forward to tasting the wines too.

892 2018-08-14 22:11:14 Amazingly how oil is the only consideration that comes to mind when discussing developments in Nigeria. Farmers needs roads to get their wares to other parts of the country too. At the state of the country now , roads to transport farm products is more important.
893 2018-08-14 22:11:10 So many snake oil sellers though. I’m just bored of it.
894 2018-08-14 22:10:50 TY... willkeep that in mind. Usual stuff of midnight oil burning when you stumble across a gem!
895 2018-08-14 22:10:44 (Totally joking but bear with me) Since they use gasoline in cocaine purification: Gasoline is made from crude oil, which is found in pools under the earth, which is a byproduct of organisms that have since died, like dinosaurs. Coke uses Dino juice and isn’t vegan. 
896 2018-08-14 22:10:41 scrubbing my paint box off of oil paint makes me wanna oil paint again, but i......need more gamasole and the other stuff. mcrip

907 2018-08-14 22:08:50 one of my fav charts is the ratio of intermodal vs ATA volumes versus oil price. Bellisima. Prices matter.
908 2018-08-14 22:08:29 Why is Safaree trending, someone spilled his coconut oil?
909 2018-08-14 22:08:29 Baby oil is dangerous if it gets in the wrong places....but of course it wouldn't on my back.#justsaying 
910 2018-08-14 22:08:09  Classic, it’s like every Man City fan since 2008.......Oil money/lottery win = plastics
911 2018-08-14 22:08:01 Well that sucks... on a similar note my 5 year old Mercedes with 35,000 miles started leaking oil. Cost me $3500 to fix. A month later the thermostat went... another $1200 down the drain.  This isn't counting the $600 bi annual oil changes and $1000 brake jobs.
912 2018-08-14 22:07:44 Try some peppermint essential oil massaged onto your temples
913 2018-08-14 22:07:36 Have you tried CBD oil?
914 2018-08-14 22:07:31 we learned from y’all. better hats and stay away from baby oil.
915 2018-08-14 22:07:10 Do you people realise this excuses you're giving for these fuck ups is the same way yomi shogunle uses to address this whole police brutality and sars issue.

Instead of addressing the issue head-on, you start deflecting and looking for loopholes/excuses.

Na all of us to hear am
916 2018-08-14 22:07:09 Do you know what it's like to be unapologetically hooked on lemon essential oil in your water? 
I do!  SO GOOD and I don't have to squirt lemon juice!
917 2018-08-14 22:07:07 It came out good. Going to have to make a new batch of oil. There is roach weed in my previous batch. Definitely affected the taste in a negative way. Otherwise they came out spectacularly. They’ll do for my brothers wedding present. LOL.
918 2018-08-14 22:07:03 Getting my oil changed and the guy was like your “I was in your car”. I was worried bcz it’s dirty but he was complaining bcz he’s a dodger fan and I have giants keys and lanyard 
919 2018-08-14 22:07:02 I am twittering from the oil change drive thru! We live in the future and the future is stupid!
920 2018-08-14 22:07:01 It’s to resuscitate obsolete energy sources because his pals/financial backers are oil barons and the like...as I just read, let’s bring back VHS, 8-tracks, horse and buggies and oil lamps.
921 2018-08-14 22:06:59 Plastic comes from oil too.
922 2018-08-14 22:06:59 yeah, only if its 100% pure peppermint essential oil, all the water diffuses it
923 2018-08-14 22:06:45 Tonight’s dinner planning process:

929 2018-08-14 22:06:05 After loads of practice and the stunning realisation that if you put makeup/primer on your eyelids your eyeshadow will oil off, I’ve perfected the cat eye with eyeshadow and built a daytime Liz Taylor Cleopatra eye look! Like most things, it’s a load of practice then BAM!!

By Kym Norris texasgirlphotography
932 2018-08-14 22:05:51 Congratulations!!!  I still so miss the Gulfport Fish House.  It was (and still is) my favorite restaurant.  The food and STAFF were amazing there. Darn Katrina and the oil spill for killing the economy to support it ...
933 2018-08-14 22:05:46 Never happen, not if you live 2 life times or there’s billions of barrels of oil under the mourne mountains, but I completely agree with you that fact we need to unite, absolutely agree !
934 2018-08-14 22:05:46 Really burning the midnight oil, isn't he?

940 2018-08-14 22:04:43 The saddest moment in Bill Maher's life was three years ago, when his Mets lost the World Series to a team from Middle America.
941 2018-08-14 22:04:42 “We will always stand up for Canadian workers”
Except in the oil and gas industry.
942 2018-08-14 22:04:40 diesel and gasoline are made out of oil to, god people are so stupid.
943 2018-08-14 22:04:15 I forgot to mention "pro-supply" in that tax reform means year 1 expensing of capex for energy companies (Oil/Gas/Mining Capex is up 84% Y-o-Y), and lower tax rates of course decrease the breakeven price for production by increasing after-tax returns.
944 2018-08-14 22:04:10 Instead of expanding our dependence on oil, your team need to transition our economy away.  Human exposure to benzene has been associated with cancer. Exposure can occur occupationally and domestically as a result of the ubiquitous use of benzene-containing petroleum products.
945 2018-08-14 22:04:02 @chazzValentino  Hey chuck my brother inlaw just got chemo what strength of hemp oil and mfr do you recommend I know your in to that holistic medicine I was looking at cbd pure hemp oil 750 mg soft gel
946 2018-08-14 22:04:01 Lack of understanding of the oil industry and economics is one of Andy's worst failures. 

And quoting the opportunist snake Smith's misinformation doesn't help

Irving refineries are not equipped for bitumen
947 2018-08-14 22:03:58 “When you have four or five oil companies, it's called a monopoly" - Doug Ford, June 19th, when he was promising to roll back gasoline prices by 10 cents.
948 2018-08-14 22:03:54 OIL!! He has greatly improved on stealing oil. A situation where oil keeps disappearing but Buhari is LEADING FROM NIGER, while his sig is duly appended in all deals is an improvement theft abeg!!

954 2018-08-14 22:03:09 In your opinion @LeopoldHeinrich with your knowledge of Oil markets and it's ripple effects, what are some of those low hanging investments?
955 2018-08-14 22:03:09 What to be pain-free? You need to try pure CBD oil
956 2018-08-14 22:03:07 What? Like those wahabbies we buy our oil from and sell weapons to ?
957 2018-08-14 22:02:55 Wait, white people have a problem with mayonnaise? Why, the shit is white, isn’t that enuff? For the record, I ain’t putting no olive oil on my BLT...
958 2018-08-14 22:02:44 Compared to the Concho/RSP thing, no. I have no idea why those guys do what they do; none of it makes sense to me. They are not in the same oil business I am in. They are mass maufacturers of widgets, hoping to make a few cents on somebody else's dollar.
959 2018-08-14 22:02:34 We better make littlebrownbear a sweater before he goes out! He’d feel v scruffy among such well dressed bears - he’s rather well ‘cherished’ - and smells of olbas oil which helps humum sleep!
960 2018-08-14 22:02:33 (probably) cause it won't drive as much direct opposition from oil interests. Thats about all I got. If we can't get Murkowski's annual energy fixers bill anywhere....

965 2018-08-14 22:02:21 It def was. Saudi Arabia knew how to accelerate it's economy through Saudi Aramco to venture into alternative industries while maintaining its oil refineries. A had classmates in PNG at Penn State who went off to work in Saudi Arabia. It really is an international operation
966 2018-08-14 22:01:52 I had it sitting on an uneven base and some of the oil spilled onto the flame under it. Next thing I know it’s a huge flame and I had to run and grab the flour out of the kitchen lmao
967 2018-08-14 22:01:44 I accuse Colonel Mustard oil of committing the crime in the in the breakfast nook with the dagger!

970 2018-08-14 22:01:20 That can now also be used as a synonym for “snake oil salesman”
971 2018-08-14 22:01:19 Erm yes, ‘that’s you’ as they say! My fave for work days when I have to pretend to be an adult (top tip = oil based cleanser). Enjoy!
972 2018-08-14 22:01:07 Easy onions dude. I love to cook. Can't fuckn sleep on garlic onion and oil..... Save me dat money
973 2018-08-14 22:01:07 tastes like motor oil.
974 2018-08-14 22:01:06 Roast the tomatoes, and at the same, grab a head of garlic, cut off the top, douse it in olive oil, wrap it in aluminum foil, and pop that in as well. All the cloves will get all meltified and magical. Blend it all together, and well, robert's your father's brother

983 2018-08-14 22:00:30 A friend says castor oil works
984 2018-08-14 22:00:25 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
985 2018-08-14 22:00:10 Well that's just it. The fact they seemed surprised w/ his struggles last yr was puzzling. As was the decision this summer to not upgrade the blueline, even marginally, to help cover he didn't return close  his old self or another injury to any of the 6 regulars.
986 2018-08-14 22:00:09 I thank the good Lord for my sixth sense. Just seconds longer and we would have all been severely/fatally wounded by our oil heater.
987 2018-08-14 21:59:56 *oil field industry
988 2018-08-14 21:59:43 Olive oil , crude oil .. I no Dey play with those oils I Dey baff dem on a steady 
989 2018-08-14 21:59:15 jamaïcain castor oil works for me
990 2018-08-14 21:59:08 Please don't buy that narrative. It was the biggest Brazilian corruption scandal discovered ever (billions were already retrieved) plus the worst economic crisis plus the destruction of Petrobras (a state-owned oil company).
991 2018-08-14 21:59:06 also, unemployment rate is a mofo here especially in my county and across board as this is oil field country and when it went bad like in 2015 it's a ghosttown etc. and this not democrat run counties
992 2018-08-14 21:59:05 Yay! Have a coupon! Use Tweet15 for 15% off our CBD oil! 
993 2018-08-14 21:58:52 But he knows all the best words...
994 2018-08-14 21:58:48 Graphene is a single dimension building material, light weight flexible useful in a multitude of ways, and is stronger than steel. As Graphene emerges with mass production, coal will become a lot more valuable. Clean because it is a pure element, oil is loaded with carcinogens.
995 2018-08-14 21:58:33 I just mispronounced 'oil' as 'awl'...this is what happens when your partner is a Southerner.
996 2018-08-14 21:58:14 It did cost Alex his snake oil empire, which may have been a calculated maneuver... but I doubt seriously that he’s in bad shape or anything. As long as he didn’t act like a lottery winner, he’s fine. I’m inclined to believe he didn’t piss away his windfall.
997 2018-08-14 21:58:13 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
998 2018-08-14 21:58:10 I knit. This is exactly why I learned, oil changes & doctors appointments.
999 2018-08-14 21:58:06 A country like Nigeria foresources example consumeshows literally everything without producing even toothbrush. Lol
Yet we have huge deposits of crude oil that could generate petrochemicals for plastics both thermoplast n thermoset
1000 2018-08-14 21:57:57 Now that Sekera is gone for the season It's incumbent on the GM to start looking now for more adequate D depth. Even if Bouchard has a good camp would they be crazy enough to keep him beyond 9 games? (Don't answer lol) The Oil can't afford to f**K around with a slow start.
1001 2018-08-14 21:57:53 Hoomom can't find my turmeric and we ran out of flaxseed oil. So now me just eating kefir and occasional egg whites.
1002 2018-08-14 21:57:53 This is how a marine oil spill response operation is supposed to work: Apparently good cooperation between the private and public sector response organisations and agencies. Act quickly, and work out the legal and financial details later.
1003 2018-08-14 21:57:41 May I add a third  you can get 15% off our CBD oil with code Tweet15
1004 2018-08-14 21:57:33 sam really pulled out some olive oil at the pool today and asked me if i wanted some “tanning oil” as she was rubbing it on her legs
1005 2018-08-14 21:57:28 Update: 17 delicious… Well… They could be better… But they will be with the next batch of oil… So I’m gonna keep it as delicious… 17 delicious pieces of fudge. They pack a punch.
1006 2018-08-14 21:57:22 So picking on wind energy to foster oil and coal doesn't really work well.  Unless you wanna give up cell phone tv broadcasting as well.
1007 2018-08-14 21:57:22 Your head have Oil
1008 2018-08-14 21:56:48 I'll be so happy if Dems take the House and Senate and pass MedicareForAll, reverse the tax cuts for the top 1% and corporations, and stand up to Trump's social idiocy. So happy. But when they reverse their oil/coal stance, it makes me skeptical at best. Stay civil.
1009 2018-08-14 21:56:05 I have been wanting to get on this  train ~ is it worth it? I am 41 with large cheek pores, normal to oil skin with some hyperpigmentation. No wrinkles thank ya Jesus 
1010 2018-08-14 21:56:04 Depends on your starting point... and type of oil
1011 2018-08-14 21:56:00 Petrochemicals remain the sole raw material for plastics industry.
In a world where the crude oil is gradually diminishing and alternative energy source does not exist for raw maerials to replace Petrochemicals  ,
Recycling plastic seems to me a good move!
1012 2018-08-14 21:55:58 The biggest thing to know about CBD oil is that it's non-psychoactive. There's also many different methods of taking CBD. Vaping for example gives quick but short term results. Meanwhile taking drops under your toungue will have longer lasting effects

1016 2018-08-14 21:55:39 Ewww although I like it on a BLT (or late night frites). Jersey tomatoes with some salt and a little olive oil!
1017 2018-08-14 21:55:34 I am going to go the other way: he was so bad when he returned last year that this is actually a gift.
1018 2018-08-14 21:55:33 Lets get rid of Pierre Trudeau.  Misogynist,  womanizer, tried to steal and destroy Western Canada's  oil industry....and more.  A crippling spender who gave Canada nothing but debt.  Sounds like Trudeau junior also,doesn't  it?

1021 2018-08-14 21:55:20 OH and since i'm sharing - I also learned that CBD oil is HUGELY beneficial in helping to heal skin! Apparently when skin is damaged and needs repair our bodies make our own cannabinoids to help repair it!! Using a lotion w/CBD helps speed up the process apparently!
1022 2018-08-14 21:55:17 @realDonaldTrump That small group of traitors and dissidents knows that President Trump will carry out all sanctions without exemption, especially the sanctions on oil

Windmills.. Holland you know.

The oil industry is a cultus and you are prove of it.
Cults have followers who believe anything when it suits their ideology.
1026 2018-08-14 21:54:49 Yes, & the 76 g fat is unlikely to contain seed oil
1027 2018-08-14 21:54:28 Oh No! This likely means rookie dman Bouchard is going to be forced to play for the Oil beyond 11 games.

1029 2018-08-14 21:53:52 Dear Ambassador, not only for you is a lesson. I believe is for all of us, in and out Venezuela.A country with such history in oil business including many techonolgical developments for the industry. My hope is,at some near point we will be able to return to Democracy and rebuild
1030 2018-08-14 21:53:50 Oil change?
1031 2018-08-14 21:53:49 Before Trump Obama produced the most US oil out of the refineries. I don't think ppl realized that. Once again his policies Trump is just enforcing them. The democrats should give each other high fives and tell Trump your welcome.
1032 2018-08-14 21:53:45 in another world at another time with a lot less ethical core, i would have been an amazing snake oil salesman.
1033 2018-08-14 21:53:39 I don't think it's oil at all. It's more strategic than economic.
1034 2018-08-14 21:53:31 Or perhaps the petrostate with the world’s largest oil reserves recognizes that the world is going to move away from oil dependency and wants to prepare themselves for that eventuality...

1037 2018-08-14 21:53:04 Prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies anoint my head with oil.
1038 2018-08-14 21:53:03 America hasn't bombed any "country" (Two Cities) since August 9th, 1945.  The advanced aerial weaponry of the American forces are so perfectly surgical, that it can recognize it's target by facial expression. Also, America has it's own oil. Try again.
1039 2018-08-14 21:53:00 Keep fighting- but don’t let Perez sell out the party to oil and fracking interests I can’t continue support for Dems if that stands. There is a difference between choice and extortion- don’t let him make the party into the “devil we know”-No Devil. Period.
1040 2018-08-14 21:52:44 There is a Major difference between hemp and marijuana. As a nurse, I support CBD Oil that is THC free. I do not support marijuana that is smoked and can contribute to lung cancer and psychoactivity. Hemp can be so useful in many ways.
1041 2018-08-14 21:52:41 CBD oil or CBD infused coffee
1042 2018-08-14 21:52:38 Totally. The board seems to have been taken over. This is very typical of the dark side of the oil industry #reefgate
1043 2018-08-14 21:52:32 Do you add any olive oil or anything like that?
1044 2018-08-14 21:52:30 ohhh I was so pissed when I went to pick my baby up from his great grandma’s house & his hair was covered in baby oil  my baby has TOO much good hair.. don’t. do. that!!!

1050 2018-08-14 21:52:10 Season over by November again. Congrats Oil!
1051 2018-08-14 21:51:56 Different than the repugs. They keep voting for trumps ridiculous things. Why do we need more military funding? Why is Tom Perez changing the rules and taking money from big oil?

1056 2018-08-14 21:51:16 Oil spill party this weekend is the move
1057 2018-08-14 21:51:06 I have TERRIBLE skin because of an autoimmune disorder and I did a TON of research on this because my skin/oil/sebum build-up would get SOOO bad after just a couple days that it would feel SLIMY in the shower but exfoliating caused really bad inflammation. I found a better way :)
1058 2018-08-14 21:50:49 Olive Leaf, Oil of Oregano, Vitamin C & D, turmeric, and NAC (n-acetyl cysteine). Should get you cleared up in 3X's/day doses til desired relief, then maintained in recommended amts per directions, but in the largest mg doses you can find. Tylenol for pain in the meantime.
1059 2018-08-14 21:50:47 Chitter choren, Hair oil pay tawajja den 
1060 2018-08-14 21:50:41 Perhaps if we could get our oil to tidewater at an affordable rate we would have a stronger economy thus more money in the government coffers #RandomThoughts
1061 2018-08-14 21:50:41 How about letting Democrats vote on whether or not they want their party taking money from big oil? That's a vote we all know the outcome for.
1062 2018-08-14 21:50:38 56% of the general election would 243 House seats (which is a vast majority), and that ratio is without PAC money or oil/coal money. Let's check back on this when the general is over and milktoast Dems get their asses handed to them in red states.
1063 2018-08-14 21:50:19 There’s nothing like the anxiety inducing taste of Szechuan peppercorn & chili oil
1064 2018-08-14 21:50:13 Peppermint oil!  Diffuse it, or rub a little on your temples and the back of your neck. Works like a charm!
1065 2018-08-14 21:49:49 Love her! And love that! I use special eye makeup remover for waterproof, or coconut oil. But that depends if you break out from it or not  I need new mascara, will def try Better Than Sex if only for the name 
1066 2018-08-14 21:49:40 If you suffer chronic pain, anxiety, or inflammation, ask us about our CBD oil at your next appointment. 405.703.2694 @ Bodin Chiropractic
1067 2018-08-14 21:49:29 Yes be careful though, it leaks a weird oil which is the leading cause of Ligma
1068 2018-08-14 21:49:27 Yes..just thinking of your boobs with lotion or oil...you made my day baby!
1069 2018-08-14 21:49:19 & being similar in structure means when you rub it on it will bind with the oils to release it from your skin, then wash away w/ mild soap when you get in the shower. I do full body coconut oil rub down and let it sit for 5 min. before my shower once a week or so (more if i can)

1073 2018-08-14 21:47:42 rosewater? a scam

1074 2018-08-14 21:47:38 So I’m sure oil do same as last year and just hope we can replace in house right ?
1075 2018-08-14 21:47:35 During the "adjusting" phase when you cut down your exfoliating regiment you can start doing some coconut rub-down with a cotton pad. The coconut oil is one of the few oils that is molecularly similar to the oils produced in our skin that cause sebum and dead skin to build up
1076 2018-08-14 21:47:28 Ah, now your in my field of play with Qaddafi. The distinction is that Sanaka wouldn't have the ability to sit on oil money the same way. There was no easy way to developement and thus he needed to work with his people. Where as Qaddafi could throw money at his problems.

1084 2018-08-14 21:46:24 Hasn't this always been the case? In the  late 1800s, sexy industries like railroads and steel were dominant. In the early 1900s oil, textiles, automobiles and industrial machinery. In the 2000s, Internet tech, energy & healthcare.

The biggest players always dwarf the others.

1095 2018-08-14 21:44:47 $500 for my daughter to find out her cat was constipated. They did a pricey blood test before a simple xray. I told her she just should've given her cat castor oil. Would've saved a lot of money.

1100 2018-08-14 21:43:49 At his age, he was never going to be the same player after the last injury & this will only make it worse. As I mentioned earlier, the benefit to this is they can at least LTIR this season and move on. The ball is in your court Pete... #Oilers
1101 2018-08-14 21:43:31 Infused coconut oil has so many applications. Use it orally, add to food, topically, you can even use a mold and make a suppository!
1102 2018-08-14 21:43:19 ridiculous oil heater makes you stewed
1103 2018-08-14 21:43:10 Norway actually owns a lot more of its industry & resources. Keeping the oil mostly under state ownership ended up to be a very smart move for the Norwegian people. It wasn't always the obvious way to go. For many years the bourgeois parties wanted to sell out the oil resources.
1104 2018-08-14 21:43:09 Isn't there some way to take legal action towards Zinke and Trump? I don't hear about them leasing land for solar and wind energy. Doesn't this signal corruption? They must be making money or accepting something in exchange from oil & gas, right?
1105 2018-08-14 21:43:09 There are creams with vitamin C but they can irritate sensitive skin. I'm not sure about topical vitamin D lots of supplements that contain it, or SAD lamps. Apparently oil production is linked to insulin production so maybe focus on blood sugar stability & see if that helps ? :)
1106 2018-08-14 21:42:57 It is only itchy if you keep shaving it off because it itches. Leave it on and wash it, may be a little oil to keep beard and skin from getting dry and it shouldn't itch.

1119 2018-08-14 21:41:28 It didn’t stop the oil but it holds well for me 
1120 2018-08-14 21:41:09 @realDonaldTrump If there are other words you speak from such laws in our world have laws in the United States you have a lot of no's in this bitch's simply a limit will notify the US-Israel terrorist hyenas you guard the oil located in Turkey.
1121 2018-08-14 21:41:07 I also apply rosehip seed oil to my face when I remember I haven't been doing it much these past couple weeks so it may not have played a big role in the results
1122 2018-08-14 21:41:03 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1123 2018-08-14 21:40:57 She should be boiled in oil.ugh!
1124 2018-08-14 21:40:36 literally any song by @lizzo her EP coconut oil is amazing and her song worship me...well the name tells you everything girl

1131 2018-08-14 21:40:02 Same same. I’ll wake up with a half-removed outfit, peachy clean skin, acids and face oil.
1132 2018-08-14 21:39:58 Creeping off to bed... a cough bottle and lemongrass oil , tweet ya later ;-)
1133 2018-08-14 21:39:47 Hate buying oil all the time
1134 2018-08-14 21:39:43 Nothing more relaxing than THE shower where you take your time, shave your legs, exfoliate, and lather up with baby oil
1135 2018-08-14 21:39:43 I go use that anointing oil pray again 
1136 2018-08-14 21:39:42 No one is MORE familiar with "unpatriotic" than this baby oil and iodine 8th grader
1137 2018-08-14 21:39:37 @InfraNews_ EMEA tomorrow reveals a major European oil tank sale process has begun and examines how Turkey’s lira crisis is undermining the guarantees backing its mammoth infrastructure programme.
1138 2018-08-14 21:39:35 I'm talking about heat trapping C02 emissions that come from burning of fossil fuels. Grannie's using a common pro oil argument suggesting oil is used by many products we can't live without so therefore we should keep expanding.

1140 2018-08-14 21:39:31 me: *pulls up to the oil change place* 
hi yes I’m here for an ¿ oil change ?
1141 2018-08-14 21:39:29 Olive Oil

1143 2018-08-14 21:39:12 They actually work. I’m asking about the toner or tonic, I saw it today at shop right and I want to get it.
The oil control is amazing, the scrub is like cream but it does the job 
1144 2018-08-14 21:39:01 Good because I use hella oil soooooo
1145 2018-08-14 21:39:01 Dammit. I really like both of those two. Time to contact the manufacturers.

Come on Dawn. You take oil spills off of ducklings and baby seals. Don't do this. 

Dammit. Dammit. Dammit.

1147 2018-08-14 21:38:45 I just ate a watermelon salad with olive oil, balsamic, basil, salt, and pepper, and it was DELICIOUS.
1148 2018-08-14 21:38:38 Energy East was mostly about exporting more oil out of Canada, wasn’t it?
1149 2018-08-14 21:38:28 Start a smoothie with carrot juice. Throw in beets, mixed greens and banana. Add fish oil if it feels right. Blend.
1150 2018-08-14 21:38:28 Literally all my friends and family members in the army say 911 was planned by our government to make money off of oil.
1151 2018-08-14 21:38:25 Bouchard was always going to play, it's just a matter of whether he gets more than the 9-game look-see. I still say it's highly unlikely.
1152 2018-08-14 21:38:24 Who ever has seen an oil spill and thought, "Wow, everything looks so clean!"
1153 2018-08-14 21:38:24 The whole going private thing will have to be abandoned at some point. It was never a serious proposal. Plus if the Saudis ever thought of being the key investor they are now distracted by the mess in Turkey and falling oil prices.
1154 2018-08-14 21:38:18 Are you talking about jobs in the government?  Liberal policies are killing private sector specially the oil and gas industry.
1155 2018-08-14 21:37:43 Tea tree oil save me
1156 2018-08-14 21:37:19 Coal is cheap abundant and compared to oil in it's natural state contains a higher level of stored energy. The oil industry were successful in demonizing coal for obvious reasons. Only that reputation stands in the way of extracting energy/uses in a more favorable way.
1157 2018-08-14 21:37:16 Right! I’ll stick to my $50.00 oil change at the Toyota dealership.
1158 2018-08-14 21:37:06 Alaska gets most of its revenue from oil. It's essentially a petro state.
1159 2018-08-14 21:36:56 No on me dammit! My face loves a good  vitamin E oil/aloe jell lube and so does the rest of me with no freaking side effects!
1160 2018-08-14 21:36:54 "most obvious factor," but not the SOLE factor, so nice try. Could it be that the cost of living in YYC has skyrocketed because, oh I don't know, Tories have been lining their coffers with oil money for the past 40 years?!
1161 2018-08-14 21:36:48 Some of you people tweet the freakiest shit while y’all are working...

If you don’t take your ass back to work and change the god damn oil out the fryer Patricia is only scheduling you 16 hours next week smh sit down.
1162 2018-08-14 21:36:40 Oh!  I know what the Maillard reaction is!  Maybe I'll look into one. I like fried food but not all that oil.
1163 2018-08-14 21:36:08 All I can say is if we are talking at best a 6-month recovery, Sekera better not see game action at all this year...unless we are talking another lost season. It's not fair to the team or player & we saw the results in '17-'18. Get him, healthy & ready for camp in 2019-20 @Oilers
1164 2018-08-14 21:36:03 Omg! Who will he impress with his truck full of credibility? How much Oil can you buy with credibility. I'd like to biy a shipload of Cabbage for Kimchi. Can I pay you in credibility? Give me a break.

1166 2018-08-14 21:35:51 When will CBD oil be available in stores without the THC?
1167 2018-08-14 21:35:44 If we must pick sides in the mayonnaise wars, we should remember that "all science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided." The essence of mayo is oil, egg, lemon juice, salt, maybe a little dijon, and that can never be wrong.
1168 2018-08-14 21:35:36 Got 4 new tires, my oil changed, and my eyebrows did. There goes all my money. I need a nap.
1169 2018-08-14 21:35:35 Just get one with a mangled foot holding the Oil drop instead of the condor talons.
1170 2018-08-14 21:35:22 Thanks! It's like ice cream right now. Which is actually fine as I only use it for smoothies. Just scoop and blend. No oil. This might be a good thing.
1171 2018-08-14 21:35:10 What? On an oil barge? 
1172 2018-08-14 21:35:09 Went to Cobblestone to get an oil change for Joe’s car, and they gave me a free wash too 
1173 2018-08-14 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this August? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.

1175 2018-08-14 21:35:05 It does.  And you can use a bit of oil (like, a tiny fraction of what you’d normally use) if you want extra crispness.  A fan circulates the hot air like a convection oven, and it cooks the food with the heat and crisps it via the Maillard reaction.
1176 2018-08-14 21:34:58 @jsbmbaggedmilk Jesus Christ man.  Who do we need to sacrifice at the nation to make this right.  Do the oil go all in to get a Justin Faulk before October?   Can’t start the season like this.
1177 2018-08-14 21:34:52 Austin got me an oil change and if that ain’t real love idk what is. He can return the car on E for all I give a fuck now cause I’ve been putting my oil change off for months
1178 2018-08-14 21:34:50 Where can you buy peppermint oil?
1179 2018-08-14 21:34:45 Whites just love our locally grown cilantro bulgogi with turnip oil.

1182 2018-08-14 21:34:23 OSU’s trustees include a member of the Smuckers family, Chairman of Marathon Oil, Clark Kellogg, and many other accomplished persons. Will they put their reputations on the line backing a proven liar, involving domestic abuse?
1183 2018-08-14 21:34:12 That oil isn't going to burn itself!
1184 2018-08-14 21:34:06 I'm middle class, so are my Brother, two Sisters, and my father.  We have done very well with these tax cuts.  Stop trying to scare us.  You're a snake oil salesman.
1185 2018-08-14 21:33:34 Which scenario would give you the fairest price of oil ?

1. As an ERC-20 token on an unregulated exchange

2. At highly regulated exchanges with speculation (current world)

3. A localized, central algo

4. Based on P2P producers/users determing the price based on supply/demand
1186 2018-08-14 21:33:29 .... What next I wonder? Whalebone corsets for women? Leeches to cure all illness? Ploughing fields with oxen?  Travel by penny farthing? Oil lamps? The abacus? Good grief America - WAKE UP!
1187 2018-08-14 21:33:29 This is what’s wrong with fracking. The agricultural industry is under threat from oil & gas. This WH does’t Care.  Dakota is under threat

1189 2018-08-14 21:33:19 I need to change the oil on my car next week and need to draft an email.
1190 2018-08-14 21:33:07 Safflower oil is what I use too! :D 

I've never done that!!!
I don't *think* there's any reason to push the oil past its smoke point.
1191 2018-08-14 21:32:56 A quick note to all men & women who are losing their hair. Add rosemary oil to your shampoo. My hair is thick as heck & I barely comb it, but I wash it all the time & use rosemary oil. Thank me when your hair grows back. Now let me go start my business to help men grow  Safaree
1192 2018-08-14 21:32:54 The lyrics of Midnight Oil’s Short Memory have never been more relevant
1193 2018-08-14 21:32:42 It will be followed as sun by rain, by dire warnings in the press about home fuel oil prices going up. The Telegraph have run the same story in August or early September every year, as far as I can trace back.
1194 2018-08-14 21:32:12 The only oil this administration knows anything about is KY Jelly.
1195 2018-08-14 21:32:11 You could thinly brush some oil on the parchment next time
1196 2018-08-14 21:32:10 He's an oil and gas shill. Of he says people should be back in cars.
1197 2018-08-14 21:31:55 Vinegar is forever, but rancid oil can make you really sick.
1198 2018-08-14 21:31:52 Oh I agree, I'm not defending the actions of my fellow country men, don't get me wrong haha we really don't need whale hunting at all today ESPECIALLY when we drown in fish and oil anyway so there's no lack of resources, our government just seem to not care about IWC I guess
1199 2018-08-14 21:31:35 Other ICOs are intentionally misrepresenting the size of their oil reserves? Because that is what the case is about. If so, yes they probably should stop doing that...based on 80 years of court precedent, not this order.
1200 2018-08-14 21:31:33 Peppermint oil capsules from H&B are your friend.
1201 2018-08-14 21:31:32 We paid for the pipeline, now build it!
Cut off indigenous funding and throw those protestors in jail. It's time to move that clean oil!
1202 2018-08-14 21:31:13 But without oil, how does everything cook?  Does it still have that savory-ness?
1203 2018-08-14 21:31:06 I never put mine in the fridge. Seal it tight and eat it quickly.  Stand it on the lid so when you turn it over and open it, the oil is at the bottom and easier to stir.
1204 2018-08-14 21:31:01 I got motor oil in my eye and almost died lol smh women ain’t shit.
1205 2018-08-14 21:30:56 Turn her blubber into oil for an oil lantern like they used to do with other whales

1219 2018-08-14 21:29:24 It depends on the type of oil spilled and the containment/removal plan. But in a year when the water is already a bit too warm for our fish friends, this is another bad omen.
1220 2018-08-14 21:29:06 Purchasing power of US $ equals 25 InR. The exchange rate of Rs 70 a $ will crumble if India stopped purchasing defence equipment, aeroplanes, computers and  crude oil and hiked import duties. The DRDO, HAL and ECIL either deliver or disappear. Switch to Solar/ Nuclear power.

1242 2018-08-14 21:26:47 Yep. It also makes sense the military has a lot of coastal infrastructure in harm’s way, potential for increased rescue operations and conflict as shipping & oil exploration takes off in the Arctic...etc

1256 2018-08-14 21:24:21 It would certainly help the world evolve and be far more peaceful. We go to war over oil, but say it's none of our business if countries stone a woman to death for tempting some jerk to rape her. Little girls too. We all deserve better. Thank you...

1258 2018-08-14 21:24:03 Am I to understand that a level of unemployment (leaving aside that it is a flaming lie of a figure) the same as a level seen in the aftermath of an oil crisis which affected the whole world, and unacceptable to an electorate  which responded to "labour isn't working" is now an
1259 2018-08-14 21:23:57 I've cut out vegetable oil from my diet (just literally today so it might not be true) and not only am I not fatigued every time I eat, I'm also always hungry.

1261 2018-08-14 21:23:37 Love these, but there are plenty available if you look hard enough. I’d want OE wheels, but wouldn’t be afraid of the high mileage. Valve stem seals are a rare failure, but can now be done with engine in situ. Gearbox should be fine as long as it’s had oil changes.
1262 2018-08-14 21:23:16 everytime i get an oil change and they come at me with oil cleaning and air filters but i always have my brother on the phone answering me so my dumbass wont pay extra 
1263 2018-08-14 21:23:05 Yes but if you are oily or don't want to look like you are melting, I'd melt it down and mix with jojoba or grapeseed oil to thin it out, then apply with a cotton ball so it's not too thick
1264 2018-08-14 21:23:01 Or imagine like a drunk heir to an oil fortune hits you crossing legally at a light? You’re living on easy street for the rest of your life
1265 2018-08-14 21:23:00 @EssenceOfEden1 Please can you list the valued benefits to the body using this oil, internally and on the skin. I have used this for years as a suntan lotion and it is very good, but not for all people, unless they are used to tanning every day.#edenbridgetown#edenbridge
1266 2018-08-14 21:22:23 Also NOT COCONUT OIL/ACV.
1267 2018-08-14 21:22:16 We were there in 2005 and toured Catholic neighborhoods. I have old photos of GWB sucking Saudi oil through a tube, and spray-painted FARC YOU on the restraining wall of a bridge
1268 2018-08-14 21:22:16 “I don’t know what you’re saying to me. I’m here because i have a coupon.” - me, when I take my car in for an oil change and they tell me what else is wrong with my car.
1269 2018-08-14 21:22:16 Give me one oil well then we can talk.
1270 2018-08-14 21:22:09 Mustard Oil is an old remedy for dry lips. Before bed, dab a few drops onto your lips &amp; massage it slightly, making them soft &amp; smooth.
1271 2018-08-14 21:22:02 Venezuela has a highly educated populace, good weather all year, massive oil reserves and is positioned close to several trillion dollar economies(U.S, Canada, Mexico, Brazil). But they managed to fuck all that up.
Next time someone proposes socialism, punch them hard.
1272 2018-08-14 21:21:38 I have to get a serum and an oil cleanser and maybe an exfoliant but I will be ready to go as soon as I get back from Germany next week!
1273 2018-08-14 21:21:32 Also those photos just look like image files. Once printed on canvas, the colours will change slightly. Go for a matte canvas and if printed, use oil based inks so that it lasts for ages, 30/40years.

1275 2018-08-14 21:21:10 Denmark has no oil. I never said Denmark was socialist. What has multiculturalism got to do with fiscal and monetary policy? Very strange arguments.
1276 2018-08-14 21:21:07 Facebook as a monopoly is more dangerous than Standard Oil or ATT. It needs to be broken up and restructured and regulated like any public utility!

1278 2018-08-14 21:20:59 [♢] Yeah, they are Buñuelos. Basically, they consist of one or two eggs, one or two cups of flour, half cup of sugar, and half cup of milk (maybe less). Mix them all until you have a uniform dough. With a big spoon, you throw that dough in hot oil, until they're fried.

1279 2018-08-14 21:20:58 I just noticed the terrific online store. WTF is he going to sell through the store, snake oil? I like the cursory mention of ride share as side gigs. Schemey, if you're even still driving, which I doubt, they aren't side gigs. they are your only legitimate source of $$.

1293 2018-08-14 21:19:15 Any Pipeline is a better solution to alternatives. You will use more energy, and cause more environmental harm, by having oil moved by trains or trucks. Think about it.

1305 2018-08-14 21:18:09 The burning of fossil fuels is not a fact of life. It's a choice we make. Sad to say, oil companies have convinced you and many others, that the solution is decades away. It's not though, its here right now. We could end almost all burning of C02 today if we had the will

1339 2018-08-14 21:14:35 Pakistan for example isn't currently funding China -- rather it imports a ton from China, and promises to make payments (somehow) in the future.  think most BRI countries similar, setting the oil countries in C Asia aside at current oil prices
1340 2018-08-14 21:14:27 The diff though is that oil futures are traded on regulated exchanges, whereas ERC-20s are traded on unregulated exchanges with rampant bad practices. Thus token prices include a premium which is counterproductive to their own platform growth as it is not a fair price for users
1341 2018-08-14 21:14:27 Just fried in oil with salt and pepper. Or chopped and very, very slowly sauteed with onions, garlic, tomatoes and lots of herbs - plus a little bitof sugar and seasoning. Yummy!

1346 2018-08-14 21:14:13 Evaluating risk is actually very hard. A few years ago many "low risk" investors put money into Oil and Gal MLPs. Master Limited Partnership in search of high Dividends in a low rate environment.  Turns out many got crushed taking massive losses.

1352 2018-08-14 21:13:28 The oil actually help fight cancer cells. My mama has been on it for about 8 months now. Huge improvement in her tumors. This is why big Pharma doesn’t want to make it legal. There are so many benefits of using cannabis oil that it scares Pharma.

1362 2018-08-14 21:12:27 Really? You’re on the side of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist? That doesn’t seem very Christian of you. Calling children and grieving parents liars while peddling snake oil “health” products seems like something Jesus would be explicitly against.

1366 2018-08-14 21:12:02 Aioli traditionally refers to an emulsion of olive oil and garlic, no eggs.

Mayonnaise aficionados co-opted the term to make their product sound fancier
1367 2018-08-14 21:11:59 China is also taking steps to begin paying for some crude oil in RMB .... than the dollar raises a foreign exchange risk that they havenot faced in decades.
1368 2018-08-14 21:11:51 Aioli is mayo that started as a crushed garlic. The emulsion required for either to “happen” is the same! I will fight this forever! (using Olive Oil doesn’t make Aioli unique, you can make Mayo with it as well!)
1369 2018-08-14 21:11:51 materials used inflated projections of oil production ... contradicted by the company’s own internal analysis  ... suggested that Tomahawk possessed leases for drilling sites when it did not ... described Laurance having a “flawless background” .... *liars*. That's all

1391 2018-08-14 21:09:25 I fear it might be a clever ploy from Elon to really hit "big oil" where it hurts. Have them heavily invested in $tsla.  Then *BOOM* - bankrupt!

1394 2018-08-14 21:08:51 Omg now they don’t have time for the oil change bc they have to check 10000 things in my car to see wtf just happened. Rest in pieces car
1395 2018-08-14 21:08:50 @PervGriffin Jay is my passive/ aggressive. We get along so great but boom! I'm taking CBD oil I'm so calm now! Anxiety in check! Awesome
1396 2018-08-14 21:08:41 A Great, Natural Oil for the body and hair. I haven't tried it in coffee as yet, not sure as yet, but I am sure it's more beneficial than pure cream....but it must have a good effect to the body also to the immune system as it is purely natural....Thank You..IanB#edenbridgetown
1397 2018-08-14 21:08:37 Tell em lady. That Jamaican black castor oil grew my eyelashes so fast. People don't know about castor oil. It kept me healthy as a horse as a kid. My mom would give me a teaspoon FULL each & EVERY morning.

1402 2018-08-14 21:07:10 I was just shuffling some music and "beds are burning" by midnight oil came on. 
One of the first cassettes I bought as a kid and remember having to explain to my dad that it wasn't about sex.
1403 2018-08-14 21:06:59 And now my hands smell like Amber and Myrrh...this beard oil is going to be awesome
1404 2018-08-14 21:06:57 I have Oculus Rift but can only use one hand (spinal injury aged 2), so found it frustrating that I couldn't be creative in VR. Any suggestions/tips? I currently oil paint in free time with one hand only etc.
1405 2018-08-14 21:06:49 They are a lot of fun to use.  I was the 3rd person to own my drum carder but the only one to actually use it.  Make sure you put a little drop of a light oil, like sewing machine oil, at all the moving points.  It’ll make it turn smoother.
1406 2018-08-14 21:06:38 Recycle stuff, dispose old electronic devices correctly, don't buy products with palm oil in them or generally don't buy what contributes to rain forest deforestation. You don't have to be a saint about all these things & completly restrict yourself. Step by step, it all helps
1407 2018-08-14 21:06:31 And that's coming on the heals of paying $3500 to fix an oil leak
1408 2018-08-14 21:06:27 My boss was unusually quiet all day. Now my emails are ringing off the chain.. too good to be true. Oh Well!!! Burning the midnight oil I suppose. Or I could just mize.....

1410 2018-08-14 21:06:12 Coal is dead.
Oil is on the way out.
Nuclear soon after.

The future is sustainable. Solar. Wind. Water. Geothermal.

Get with the times, old man.
Start moving jobs to these industries instead of trying to revive the dead.
1411 2018-08-14 21:06:07 Ball pegs? You mean the swivels, if it’s lower arm needing to be removed pull straight down, the upper arm I’d suggest some sort of tool pushed through the air gap to get it to shift, maybe use a touch of shock oil or washing up liquid to lubricate it & make it easier to pop out
1412 2018-08-14 21:06:06 If it makes you feel any better, I just took my Mercedes in for an oil change and it cost me $2000
1413 2018-08-14 21:06:06 In the mid ‘50’s we used to use Crisco or Baby oil.
1414 2018-08-14 21:05:55 Oil diffuser works best after a sesh.
1415 2018-08-14 21:05:52 We’re going there this time. Maybe some whale oil Ale at Sea World.
1416 2018-08-14 21:05:46 Vitamin E oil is a life saver
1417 2018-08-14 21:05:33 Yes. The CBD oil works, as it’s derived from cannabis. Hemp oil is a joke, in comparison.
1418 2018-08-14 21:05:29 Most women who wear wigs for convenience & actually have hair..unfortunately, men can't help what happens with their hair..I suggest they use rosemary oil in their shampoo.
1419 2018-08-14 21:05:20 It truly is a miracle oil for me. I only buy it at my wellness store where I can trust is the purest.
1420 2018-08-14 21:05:06 There’s a Snapchat filter with oil blotting sheets. My best friend sent it to me like “reminds me of you”

Bitch you shady. You right, but shady.
1421 2018-08-14 21:04:49 @tommuellerX are you involved with any Blockchain projects for the olive oil industry?  It seems like an ideal application. #Blockchain
1422 2018-08-14 21:04:43 By "G" you meant "snake oil salesman spreading conspiracy theories about and incites the continued harassment of people who had their children and classmates murdered" ?
1423 2018-08-14 21:04:24 Massage your scalp with coconut oil and shea butter. If possible, have the front row redone, so they’ll leave some of the hair out. Don’t let anyone touch your edges again.
1424 2018-08-14 21:04:20 World peace more like shaft them sop they cant sell oil then the USA gets to sell more, your an idiot who's destabilising the world to line your own pockets!!
1425 2018-08-14 21:04:18 Why doesn’t @IndyEleven pay for it? That’s what you should be directing your frustration out. Not Lucas Oil. Let’s be reasonable.

1428 2018-08-14 21:03:57 My house is dirty, I need an oil change, I haven’t showered and I didn’t workout today...

My life is in shambles
1429 2018-08-14 21:02:50 She’s just telling the story of her life as a snake oil vendor among other snake oil vendors. She’s of it, not apart from it. No sympathy required.
1430 2018-08-14 21:02:41 this program is trying to entice American kids to go into math, science, & engineering. not enough Americans are going into these fields. even if it's misguided, it's no worse than than oil & farm subsidies, & far better than tax loopholes, wars of choice like Iraq, etc.
1431 2018-08-14 21:02:34 Third world !! If first world did not come and find oil will we ever knew it is exist ? As this side talk on very expensive chairs that cost at least 10-15 bbl of oil being used by idiots

1436 2018-08-14 21:01:51 I escorted him from the station to the villa and we stopped off for a beer along the way. We got given tapas gratis. He looked at the waitress like she was the spawn of Satan, all because she returned to pour a little olive oil on his unasked for tapas.
1437 2018-08-14 21:01:43 you have lost your identity. What will you be without oil. Have you ever done anything useful. Our country manufacturing lots of products. Even Atak helicopter. Unmanned aerial vehicle. Armed Unmanned aerial vehicle too. I'm proud of my country & our nation. Those days will past.
1438 2018-08-14 21:01:41 dawg an oil change for my lil ass beetle almost $100 
1439 2018-08-14 21:01:34 Which oil states in the two most effective and hard to imagine. In my experience, Midwesterners are more fundamental.
1440 2018-08-14 21:01:26 i’m tired of having a car. Have to pay for my tire, I need an oil change like goodbye
1441 2018-08-14 21:01:25 i just spent 2 hours getting all cute for my dick appointment and guess what? he's not replying to any of my texts bitchhh if i dipped myself in coconut oil for nothing that will it omg
1442 2018-08-14 21:01:08 I remember reading in 2014 that less than a year before Wood down-sized the amount, the Chairman of Oil & Gas said at a conference there was at about 3 times as much maybe more.
I agree we should keep it as a bonus but I’m sure it could fund a little of the SNHS, education etc 
1443 2018-08-14 21:01:07 I will do so providing only superficial details of the kill in my strategy except Buhari is ready to give me an oil block

1450 2018-08-14 21:00:21 yeah it used to be perfect then I got really into makeup and wasn’t into skin care so the oil build up caused blackheads and you can’t see them through pics but I can in person and it would just bug me! lol
1451 2018-08-14 21:00:13 Fuuuck these kids are hilarious af lmao then my nephew toe start bleeding cause I dropped my oil pen on it by accident 
1452 2018-08-14 21:00:11 I may have to marry Felipe della Bruna from @MarcellaDeptfrd for his olive oil cake. #omgivediedandgonetoheaven
1453 2018-08-14 21:00:05 Ain't nothing slick to a can of oil
1454 2018-08-14 20:59:56 Please do not assume ole oil is something easy to play in and wash off.
Once that sun hit lmao
1455 2018-08-14 20:59:47 I'm sure the service ruck has a tiger torch of some kind readily available. Just avoid the oil jugs if possible. Fucking stripped winged terrorists.
1456 2018-08-14 20:59:46 Oh, someone needs to do that portrait in oil and gift Donnie with it. Or just large prints so we can start replacing any pic of him that appears in a public building.

1460 2018-08-14 20:59:26 Yeah, all we need is a state run petrol industry that produces more oil per capita than Saudi Arabia-like the kind Norway has-, or a state-administered banking Mecca and we too can make it work too.
1461 2018-08-14 20:59:26 It's extremely acidic. You'll realize that products that use lemon often use the oil in the rinds or extracts or neutralize with other products, never the raw juice.
1462 2018-08-14 20:59:18 Haven't. This isn't about my or your moral compass. It's as crass as the oil sands advocates 'demanding' Energy East. If you want to escalate sanctions on Saudis, do that at the federal gov't / UN level, not Irving Oil.
1463 2018-08-14 20:59:09 Hard & tiring work pouring oil on troubled waters- hope all goes well for you. Never forget the night before our two got their results...not easy.

1471 2018-08-14 20:58:25 That was when we did not need oil???
1472 2018-08-14 20:57:58 Jeez my car sounds horrible lol prolly cos I haven’t changed my oil after 1,400 miles I should’ve changed it

1474 2018-08-14 20:57:10 How come you have exempted it from your upcoming carbon tax and are not subjecting Saudi oil to the same environmental regulations you have imposed on Western Canadian oil?
1475 2018-08-14 20:57:00 It’s not anything in the government - it’s climate change. The world is getting hotter, less water, things get drier, more fires. Repeat. But don’t worry it’s irreversible so the GOP won the end of humanity for some oil oligarchs and Putin. Yay.
1476 2018-08-14 20:56:58 One more time...I trade level to level...I do not care if oil goes to $30 or $300...I trade what I see...I have posted both long and short trades
1477 2018-08-14 20:56:57 Am I missing something about @HaloTopCreamery ice cream? I wanted it to be good so badly (bc “healthy” ) but it kind of just tastes like frozen coconut oil with ice. Do I need to try a different flavour?
1478 2018-08-14 20:56:25 And his stuff. If people stopped buying his snake oil he would go away.

1484 2018-08-14 20:55:18 Did he mean to say “all these wonderful oil riggers”
1485 2018-08-14 20:54:57 The simple fact is, any PEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle, BEV or PHEV) is only as efficient on electric as its rated MPGe, & some PHEVs of the same class are rated higher than similar popular BEVs. There's no need to mislead about PHEVs to advance the shared mission of reducing oil.
1486 2018-08-14 20:54:48 Crude oil business is projected to take the back seat with time. But is vegetable oil business one to invest in then? When people wan live healthy dey avoid all types of oil sef!
1487 2018-08-14 20:54:40 u can chew gun & walk at the same time, & the US should be able to raise taxes & cut govt waste at the same time. lots of that waste is in the Pentagon & in defense contracts, oil & farm subsidies, tax loopholes, wars of choice like Iraq, swampsters like Scott Pruitt, etc.
1488 2018-08-14 20:54:11 You shouldn’t even use dish soap to help clean animals affected by oil spills, right @dawndish?
1489 2018-08-14 20:53:46 worlds economy runs on Oil owned by Muslim countries,

1494 2018-08-14 20:53:14 Canada's @Cabinet  is way cooler than ours in the US :O We have a lady in charge of education who isn't qualified and whose family makes money off of student loans. We have a guy in charge of the EPA who was in bed with oil companies and now the next guy is in bed with coal. :/
1495 2018-08-14 20:53:13 “You cannot say it any other way – that is a good thing for the UK sector and for the basin.

1496 2018-08-14 20:53:08 so my NYX pomade brow thing got all dried up and since I dont have eye drops or baby oil I decided to leave it in my car so i can melt lets hope it works lol
1497 2018-08-14 20:53:03 I am not so intelligent like you, but can you tell me why did BJP people make a national drama over petrol prices (Rs 70) in 2013 when crude oil was $110/Barrel but our petrol price keep rising under NDA rule now even though crude oil dropped as low as $43/Barrel in 2016?
1498 2018-08-14 20:52:58 Inflation a result of rising wages and economic growth. So you want them both to fall? 
Deficit will be 30 trillion + or -  exactly when? 
If Putin wanted Trump elected, it backfired Bigly. Worst hand puppet ever. You should be happy

1501 2018-08-14 20:52:39 That's better together oil, it was always there. Scottish oil ran out 4 years ago.
1502 2018-08-14 20:52:38 Instead of Cologne and deotorant I just use gasoline an oil dry
1503 2018-08-14 20:52:37 US won't allow India to buy oil from Iran and our 56 inch megalomaniac doesn't have the balls to violate the Americans.
1504 2018-08-14 20:52:16 Norway is a little country with a ton of oil money that spends it on its citizens. They don't need to try and get rich. They're chillin.
1505 2018-08-14 20:52:09 Yes. The acid profile in it is better for dry skin. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, grapeseed oil works better.
1506 2018-08-14 20:52:02 The priests who committed this crimes, the bishops who knew of it and did nothing should be stripped of their vocation, publicly. And handed to the Vatican, so the Vatican can punish them to our own laws. They shall be flogged for their crimes, the Holy oil scraped of their hands
1507 2018-08-14 20:51:59 Anything you feel like putting in your hair for a period of time. Lmao but I made my own. Avocado, lavender oil, coconut oil, a hot oil treatment, rosemary oil, and fish oil. I leave it in for 10 and then wash it twice bc all the oil. 10/10 recommend for your long locks
1508 2018-08-14 20:51:34 You then need to look at all the regulations struck down by CPC's that protected our environment. Oil is a fact of life for now, it is not only used for fuel, if it was, it would be an easy choice I would think, since it is not it will be a hot button topic for years to come.

JUST CHECKING...
1513 2018-08-14 20:51:13 He doesn't care about destroying the people behind the industry, he cares about transitioning our planet from oil to renewables, and the Saudis see this investment as a hedge against their limited resource. As oil supply decreases, prices go up, people turn to renewables.
1514 2018-08-14 20:51:03 In truth, a mature man who uses hair oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.

1517 2018-08-14 20:50:22 And they have oil. But they are super rich. And they give mad subsidies and perks to electric vehicle owner's which are expensive (relate to wealth)
1518 2018-08-14 20:50:17 make a nice, zippy marinade with garlic, paprika, olive oil, and put some shrimp on the barbie.  Also a fun salad and bread, of course  Then I'd share it with you and chat about whatever you wanted to.
1519 2018-08-14 20:50:03 Back to reality tomorrow, back to the oil mill.
1520 2018-08-14 20:49:42 Will @NBCNews hire that reporter if @PressSec stops calling on that reporter who deferred?
Anti-trust is wrong! Can you imagine the Public Relations departments of the big oil companies acted in solidarity to promote higher oil prices?
1521 2018-08-14 20:49:34 i finally watched there will be blood last night and realized the blood was actually the oil

1525 2018-08-14 20:49:00 Countries can’t be equal as things such as oil etc can only be collected  in certain places in the world so the countries near it will claim it in turn making them more richer as they have more oil than most countries

1528 2018-08-14 20:48:39 You can buy the palm oil in large quantities from the local village or sellers and resell. This works well if you don't need stress too. But logistics is necessary.
1529 2018-08-14 20:48:39 Not a medical tweeter, but magnesium effectively ends my muscle cramps. I like a topical oil spray called Life-Flo.
1530 2018-08-14 20:48:18 Try castor oil, i use the normal one, hercules brand is abt r15. Moisturise with it after wash or put some in a spray bottle(mix the castor oil with water) then use that as a daily moisturiser.
1531 2018-08-14 20:48:06 If the plantain isn’t squirting oil at the slightest touch, I don’t want it.
1532 2018-08-14 20:47:59 I pulled into a shop by my house to get an oil change and i didn’t see anyone in sight. So i started pulling in and one of the workers came out all hostile LITERALLY yelling at me to stop. I immediately reversed and left.
1533 2018-08-14 20:47:49 I need to get a full body massage with warm oil. My back and neck killing.
1534 2018-08-14 20:47:39 You find and buy a great agric palm plants and acquire land to plant them. Apply the necessary things and in 6 months you mill them and sell the oil the palm fronts, kernel and other products gotten. You make cool hard earned cash.
1535 2018-08-14 20:47:29 Everytime i gas up. I get really angry that there are politicians who own stock in oil companies. Therefore my gas prices are jacked up and these b8stards are getting richer while i barely make it.

1548 2018-08-14 20:46:19 Remember that time capitalist Britain declared war on capitalist Germany to defend capitalist Poland while Communist USSR helped Germany out and supplied them with oil? For all your talk of material conditions, Communists have a hard time addressing real world events
1549 2018-08-14 20:45:53 Bergamot oil has been one of my favorite essential oils;  it builds up positivity and confidence, elevates your mood, and is known to be a powerful ally in skin care and general wellness. #Bergamot #EssentialOils #Aromatherapy

1551 2018-08-14 20:45:35 That is when one could see it all go down hill. But it wasn't really apparent until around 1971 when oil crisis started. And it was the final nail.
1552 2018-08-14 20:45:35 I've been eating veggies almost every day since I've been back. 

It still counts if they're sauteed in a bunch of olive oil, garlic, and soy sauce right?

1564 2018-08-14 20:44:26 Standing up for BASIC human rights can never give a liberal democracy a 'black eye', failing to do so can. 
 No amount of oil or oppression in a Dictatorship can change the desire for free expression , within or outside its borders.

1565 2018-08-14 20:44:22 Not according to the rest of the world. We are horrible polluters who don't give a sweet f&$% about the environment. We want to destroy the planet with our terrible oil.

1571 2018-08-14 20:43:59 We never demand anything from the KSA because, you know, oil.
1572 2018-08-14 20:43:58 They have $12 to $15 billion for an oil pipeline, but didn't have a single dollar to fight climate change in their 2018 budget. Go look for yourself
1573 2018-08-14 20:43:58 OK gang. What’s the deal with almost no plain crisps in the U.K.? What if you don’t want vinegar, chili, bacon, crankcase oil or the other 5,000 varieties?
1574 2018-08-14 20:43:57 I wouldn’t use anything with chemicals cause your face seems fine, I would do a oatmeal scrub. It helps with redness in the skin and acne. Also the scrub will remove dirt and oil.

1577 2018-08-14 20:43:35 Seems to be @JustinTrudeau s way and the same for the pro oil and gas conservatives. Either party is only going to continue to make things worse for this planet, and for life on it. #cdnpoli
1578 2018-08-14 20:43:28 I never realized how many businesses in Tennessee have “Volunteer” somewhere in the name. And they all have that gross orange writing and the damn checkerboard pattern. It can be an oil company or a tattoo parlor. Doesn’t matter.
1579 2018-08-14 20:43:19 Looks like used cooking oil. Who vetted this video?
1580 2018-08-14 20:43:19 i put cbd oil in my açaí bowl. i’m like friggin quirky.
1581 2018-08-14 20:43:10 Try peppermint. When my daughter gets migraines, we put on the defuser with peppermint oil and it seems to help.
1582 2018-08-14 20:43:03 Dont see any immediate danger of the rich getting poor lol. For instance: Henry Ford made an electric car for his wife faster than any ice car he had, and yet, oil barons halted development, through violence mostly, for 100yrs.
1583 2018-08-14 20:42:58 if you don't know how to check your own car oil, seriously look in the mirror and ask yourself what went wrong in your life. Clean your room too!

1649 2018-08-14 20:37:37 ISLANDERS going to the mainland to see @Runrig1973 at the weekend. Make sure you fill your oil tank with water. That way, thieves’ bounty will be contaminated.
1650 2018-08-14 20:37:37 What used to be, is all part of a culture that is considered toxic. "It's not who we are," repeated ad nauseam. 
Lack of knowledge, understanding of who we are, how we got here leaves many adrift without direction or purpose in life, waiting for instruction
1651 2018-08-14 20:37:33 2. We have to import what we have to import. It applies to all nation. But the question is whether we have any alternate option? Majority of our export is crude oil. Whether we have any alternate option on that? We just now talking about Ethanol.

1662 2018-08-14 20:36:28 And then he so very carefully dips it in a small pot of wash, an oil emulsion of some sort, and brushes it over the ship's surface, exaggerating the shadows that would not exist in a miniature scaled so small...
1663 2018-08-14 20:36:26 The cost of the oil in my Alabaster Box
1664 2018-08-14 20:36:26 U don't seem to understand where we were coming from. So it would be definitely difficult for u to understand what has been achieved. However, are u aware we suffered loss in production of oil volume and same time experienced drastic drop in oil price with no savings?
1665 2018-08-14 20:36:21 There are more people employed in wind energy. Why are we promoting fuel for global warming. Coal like whale oil is an ancient source of fuel.
1666 2018-08-14 20:36:04 It is also a political ploy by the #Australian #coal #LNP (Libs.) and #GOP #Oil to protect their vested interests in an #energy monopoly via a common gateway (the grid): It’s a sham, don’t fall for it. #auspol.

1670 2018-08-14 20:35:57 A history lesson on mayo. Someone mixed eggs and oil... it’s gross. The end... and I wasn’t even a women’s studies major.
1671 2018-08-14 20:35:55 1. How will you keep water/sewer rates down (especially in strapped local economies) as aging infrastructure needs major repairs?    2. Will you protect surface owners plus implement state wide oil and gas drilling restrictions in residential and environmentally sensitive areas?
1672 2018-08-14 20:35:47 If the bar gets any lower they're gonna strike oil.

1675 2018-08-14 20:35:38 #Food for thought...or thoughts for food:  If cilantro draws heavy metals from the blood stream, it also draws them from the soil it grows in. If sunflowers absorb radioactive isotopes from the environment do their seeds & oil also contain said isotopes? I won't be eating either.
1676 2018-08-14 20:35:34 It’s an oil
1677 2018-08-14 20:35:28 Web search Henry Ford's Hemp Car. Hemp can produce everything oil can without the toxic effects to the planet. Its carbon neutral and removes contamination. It can move us to 100% bio based liquid fuels.

1679 2018-08-14 20:35:15 Isn't peanut butter keto friendly? That and the olive oil got you right for days.

1681 2018-08-14 20:35:14 To stay in crypto I `forced` my family to stay `cool` for 3 weeks without heating - no warm water - in the winter, once. Ahh, the good times. This is true though...

1698 2018-08-14 20:33:48 Russia has dumped all USA treasuries. Moscow will continue to minimize all dealings with USA and will pay in Rebels when possible --- Russia has stated they will not take any responsive sanctions against USA -  Russia dealing now in Petro-Yuan for all its oil sales.
1699 2018-08-14 20:33:40 Hmm. Healthcare costs up inflation up deficit increased over $1T projected to be 145% of GDP. Oh yeah and Putin wanted Trump elected, his campaign had over 25 contacts that they lied to the DOJ about and Russia has ability to hack our infrastructure yet Congress does nothing.

1782 2018-08-14 20:25:32 Yup but the difference with this, is he would be out the entire season. The other issue, of course, is finding a player worth said money, without parting with more assets.
1783 2018-08-14 20:25:20 I’d say grease but my fat ass uses olive oil. Trying to save my arteries as much as they can
1784 2018-08-14 20:25:20 Maybe try replacing the tea tree oil with lemon juice or jojoba oil and using less olive oil :)
1785 2018-08-14 20:25:20 No one has suffered more than muslims since 9/11. Our invasions have led to the death of over 1 MILLION iraqis. 100,000s of Afghans, Libyans, 75,000 Pakistanis, as well as thousands of our troops, for OIL and Rothschild banks.
1786 2018-08-14 20:24:49 I thought this whole time something was really wrong with it . Whole time it’s a oil leaked on some plugs

1788 2018-08-14 20:24:47 Nahhhh, olive oil area tho ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1789 2018-08-14 20:24:45 Pauna is also used to describe a kitchen accessory - the skimmer used for making things like boondi and for draining excessive oil when you're taking deep fried things out of the kadhai.
1790 2018-08-14 20:24:43 That's been my motto. Olive oil, lemon, and egg is better than soybean oil, vinegar and egg.
1791 2018-08-14 20:24:40 Hate getting popped by the oil!

1793 2018-08-14 20:24:12 I’m trying to figure out if my new air fryer requires a dab of olive oil for frozen things. It seems to be only for something made from scratch.

1797 2018-08-14 20:23:50 Just upped my dose of CBD oil& changed it to a mix of black pepper&tumeric.. great for inflammation and a more sedating effect. I’m needing a great sleep... as seems I’m too active and has me too alert.

1800 2018-08-14 20:23:31 i took my car to get a professional oil change for the first time instead of doing it myself and i’m not prepared for all the things they’re going to tell me are wrong with him

1802 2018-08-14 20:23:19 Azerbaijan should learn from Armenia how to develop human capital and democracy despite not exporting oil and being under economic sanctions.  If Azerbaijan was in Armenia’s situation, it would not last a week.

1806 2018-08-14 20:22:37 Shows it’s proper oil. Not for lubricating tractors. Quite positive tbf.
1807 2018-08-14 20:22:25 They were US service men: as with oil, men on 2 wks on/2 wks off will take a train to Newcastle or Birmingham etc!

1814 2018-08-14 20:21:55 @Valvoline I went to your store in Racine WI to get an oil change. Horrible customer service! Pulled in and sat for 5 minutes, No one came to see what I needed. Pulled back into a parking spot, doors locked. I see a kid walking up with KFC and he says “I’m on lunch”.
1815 2018-08-14 20:21:43 If it the oil I mean takes your cares away that is the best selling point it has
I will agree when smoked I might giggle my cares away
1816 2018-08-14 20:21:43 Oil change, alignment, brakes, rotors, calipers.... my car bet not ask me for shit else this year smdh
1817 2018-08-14 20:21:42 What dose do you take? I’ve tried CBD oil but it didn’t do much for my anxiety. I don’t know if I was taking a dose too low or not

1828 2018-08-14 20:20:35 Pay for your oil changes and car washes. Just stop complaining about drivers trying to get paid accordingly. You don’t think about our overhead. “Do something else then. No one is forcing you take drive” just like no one is forcing you to take rideshare.

1831 2018-08-14 20:20:10 Sadly, the scum seem to think they have free reign to do what they like following the election of Trump. Trudeau needs to condemn the rise of fascism and immediately renationalize the wheat board and other Saudi assets in Canada. A ban on all Saudi oil and shipping is needed too.

1835 2018-08-14 20:19:54 easy:

-raise taxes on the rich
-we only have 7 federal tax brackets, but we should have 20: we shouldn't tax millionaires & billionaires at the same rate
-end tax loopholes
-no wars of choice like Iraq
-1% yearly wealth tax on assets over 5M
-end oil & corporate subsidies
1836 2018-08-14 20:19:49 Buhari wants to allocate oil blocks to state for massive infrastructural development. A big threat to democracy.

1847 2018-08-14 20:18:29 What oil? 
1848 2018-08-14 20:18:15 Just watched a woman say see looked at the ingredients on a packet of granola (surely muesli?!) and saw it was packed with sugar so she decided to make own. She starts with a shitload of coconut oil (should be called coconut lard) and maple syrup... idiot.
1849 2018-08-14 20:18:06 I love when I don’t have time to change my own oil, I bring it in to get it done and they try to tell me my car has all of these “broken” things. Just because I am a girl does not mean I don’t know shit about cars.. I grew up working on them
1850 2018-08-14 20:18:06 I have a vape pen with cbd oil and when my husband was in icu for two weeks I used it often and I really could tell the difference.

1852 2018-08-14 20:17:52 But it makes sense to heavily subsidize the world wide polluting oil industry and keep destroying earth ?
1853 2018-08-14 20:17:51 Dallas fuel got a 35million dollars investment from an oil company and that's the reason they rebranded. Also they have huge sponsors so doubt they are mad.
1854 2018-08-14 20:17:50 @RealMichaelKay @TMKSonYES roasted cauliflower is great - toss it in olive oil, sprinkle w/S&P, and pop into the oven. Do broccoli or fresh green beans the same way.

1857 2018-08-14 20:17:22 Saudi needs to diversify from oil. New technology has not been good for SA, many more nations have large supplies now. The guaranteed cash cow is gone.
1858 2018-08-14 20:17:22 When is America going to stop bombing COUNTRIES killing all humanity and life. Just to take over for oil and pipelines
1859 2018-08-14 20:17:20 Yes calculated studying not excessive, just understand your nature.
1860 2018-08-14 20:17:06 What SPF does olive oil come with?
1861 2018-08-14 20:17:00 Or without oil of any type. There are for example, peanut butters with palm oil when peanuts have natural oil. They do it to make the product cheaper not better.
1862 2018-08-14 20:16:59 In many cases like this children assist their parents or guardians that are handicaps or blind.
1863 2018-08-14 20:16:58 She didn’t take money from Blue Cross. She took money from their employees. If someone who works at a gas station donates $100 to a campaign it doesn’t mean they took money from “the oil industry”.

You are so screwed.

That thing has nowhere for the oil to run off! Gosh! x3
1884 2018-08-14 20:13:51 Glad you mentioned Turkey! Who cared about the Lira? Well every market in the EU now!

1885 2018-08-14 20:13:44 You didn't understand this:

Clean energy is cleaner than burning oil / coal / gas.
1886 2018-08-14 20:13:41 There's this popular anime called Food Wars (Shokugeki no Soma) and it's, well, full of cooking duels. It sounds silly at first but it's so well done that when you realize you're like "omg how that dude is using the same kind of Italian olive oil that he is, how will he win??"

1890 2018-08-14 20:13:34 I almost paid 85$ for an oil change cause it’s “synthetic”, called my dealership and found out they do it for 30$ 
1891 2018-08-14 20:13:33 My new book: Oil and God
ME religious extremism grew after Ottoman defeat in 1918. 
O&G studies why hatred & violence replaced the tolerant Ottoman Sunni Hanafi Islam. 
O&G accuses Wahhabism, oil, Arab/Israel conflict, and empowerment of Iran by G.W. Bush & Obama.
1892 2018-08-14 20:13:15 Whaaaaat? It does? Because what I've heard and seen online is that CBD oil isn't legal in the US
1893 2018-08-14 20:13:15 Welp, that's just what I needed today. It looks like the tire pressure sensor was right: My car's left front tire is in the trunk and the donut spare is on in its stead. I'll take it into the shop for at least one new tire (and an oil change while it's there) tomorrow morning. 
1894 2018-08-14 20:12:43 Wash & condition my hair with cantu products like every one or two weeks depending, while its damp I use cantu grow strong strengthening treatment, grease my scalp with jamaican castor oil, I dont use heat often on my hair but when i do i use tresemme heat protection.

1898 2018-08-14 20:12:11 The problems will increase (in India) if the price (per barrel) of oil increases..... and they are expected to!!! In order for the economy of Saudi Arabia to break-even/ STAY ALFLOAT..... oil needs to be $US 100 per barrel! This is not rocket science! Xx PS. Global Currency WARS!

1907 2018-08-14 20:10:42 Will it be right to say that @OfficialAPCNg resorted into Vote buying because the party lacks ideologies and Principles and may not be able to win any election fairly?

This is a very disturbing trend.

1914 2018-08-14 20:10:01 Agreed. Very disappointed in @elonmusk 's decision to go to Saudi big oil for funding. Although its not a done deal yet... I hope it doesn't go through.. Waiting for my Model 3 delivery this November as well.

2) Empowerment of Iran by GW Bush & Obama.

1923 2018-08-14 20:08:54 My parents will never let me forget when I went to get an oil change and bought a new car instead....
1924 2018-08-14 20:08:49 2008 Chrysler Pacifica, New front brake pads, rotors and wheel, new spark plug wires, fresh oil change, good tires, does not have 3rd row seating, 3.8 engine with 188,000 miles
1925 2018-08-14 20:08:42 I thought this had already exploded... This year alone I think 5 brands of cooking oil 'Salad' have been taken of the shelves due to high levels of 'Mercury'
1926 2018-08-14 20:08:41 They asked me all this stuff and I was just agreeing and then they told me the price and I was like exfuckingscuuuuuze me? Just change my oil and inspect my car please lol
1927 2018-08-14 20:08:34 And when something won't start, "did you you check the oil?"
1928 2018-08-14 20:08:32 Hmmm. Every tax bracket was reduced, unemployment lowest in 40 yrs, wages rising, except for Blue Falcons thumbs down a debate over healthcare might have happened.  At least ppl aren't FORCED to purchase useless polcies.
1929 2018-08-14 20:08:31 Oil I love you but I'm too damn lazy to do this
1930 2018-08-14 20:08:27 3) Which brings us to the irony of a decreasing labor force particip. rate, w/ low employment - as well as (absent) wage growth, & a pinch of inflation. Oil is $65 or so now (w/ strong USD$) - imagine inflation w/ 0 wage growth (Oil>USD) or bond auctions w rate hikes (Rates>USD)
1931 2018-08-14 20:08:23 #nationalcycletoworkday tomorrow, dust off your Lycra and oil up your chain. @cycletoworkday
1932 2018-08-14 20:08:11 Need this damn oil change done!
1933 2018-08-14 20:08:09 Whichever in the end can generate money ofcourse. 
Saudi gets a really interesting position in the new automotive industry. Seeing the world being less dependend on oil having a share in the electric car pioneer is good.
Human rights is in the end a hobby for left liberals.
1934 2018-08-14 20:08:08 my car shows me the oil level and tyre pressure on the dashboard not that i know what it means
1935 2018-08-14 20:07:29 @ImranKhanPTI Imran shah & 4 policemen stood by watching a citizen getting beaten should be sacked. He has no defence. Actions unacceptable
1936 2018-08-14 20:07:20 1) Tariff’s have backfired on the U.S more than they’ve helped, to say the least. U.S negative(-) exports (adds to deficit) - electronics, cars, computers, indus machinery, oil, etc., ”Made in China” - China is a producer. Hard labor, savings, long hours, etc.,
1937 2018-08-14 20:07:19 nothing beats a good baguette and some olive oil. simple pleasures.
1938 2018-08-14 20:07:14 Why wouldn’t Oil bring hi@ back cheap? Like $850-900k
1939 2018-08-14 20:06:56 Build the wall and oil the top.  I want to see the climbers slide back down!

1945 2018-08-14 20:06:05 I know those oil rig surveys is where the money’s at

1949 2018-08-14 20:05:47 APC Did Not Ask Him To Join Them  Either Ask Him To Defect To APC.

He's Noting In Nigeria. Sai BUHARI
1950 2018-08-14 20:05:41 Let me get this straight, you’re suggesting Scotland out performs the UK? How? Per capita? But that is because of the relative population sizes. That doesn’t indicate a countries wealth. Scotland is not rich with or without oil. Independence is madness economically for Scotland.
1951 2018-08-14 20:05:31 Shows you western countries just give a shit about money/oil and nothing else. I wonder why they haven't tried to "save" the Saudis like they did in Afghanistan and Iraq 
1952 2018-08-14 20:04:55 Both are cancerous. China is the sleeping giant  and the worse of the two in many ways.

1953 2018-08-14 20:04:54 You've got to pay for that v8 soundtrack. I hope you had shares in an oil refinery!
1954 2018-08-14 20:04:28 Mad Max thought oil was valuable
1955 2018-08-14 20:04:25 I’ve spent the whole summer eating one finest burger, no bun and a massive salad with balsamic oil dressing.  I’m like a racing snake. With boobs. 
1956 2018-08-14 20:04:23 Girl I FEEL YOU. When mine start getting real bad I put peppermint essential oil on my temples and forehead and neck/shoulder area. Doesn't stop the pain but it helps out a little bit!! I also use a heating pad for my upper back area to help ease tension
1957 2018-08-14 20:04:15 Try not bombing for oil
1958 2018-08-14 20:04:13 Every time I get my oil changed or get inspected they wanna try to talk me into getting stuff “fixed” just bc I’m a girl

1960 2018-08-14 20:03:59 I've had chicken pox and have been breaking out with shingles, off and on, since 1996. It's brought on by stress. I refuse to get the vaccine or take drugs for it. It's easily handled by managing my stress and putting lavender oil on it after my shower.

1966 2018-08-14 20:03:19 whats the protocol for that alone ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ yung oil refinery
1967 2018-08-14 20:03:11 @realDonaldTrump you hypocrite.  You give Germany shit about importing oil from Russia and yet you do the same. Putin is sending more crude oil to the US west coast than ever before. Shame on you.
1968 2018-08-14 20:03:10 Gotta oil it up at least  lol 
1969 2018-08-14 20:03:04 Do you ever wish you could tell the #BB20 houseguests to stop using olive oil to tan because they could get skin cancer?
1970 2018-08-14 20:03:02 Imran shah and the police who stood watching the guy getting beaten should be sacked no questions
1971 2018-08-14 20:02:52 I'm so tired of talking about it and recieving comments like have you tried Crystal's, positive thinking, veganism, essential oil, just not thinking about it, it honestly feels like nobody understands

1976 2018-08-14 20:02:05 This was me yesterday. I feel u boo. Imma cop u some lavender oil so when u feel this way u can just rub it on ur hands and inhale. It helps.
1977 2018-08-14 20:02:01 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1978 2018-08-14 20:01:57 $150 for an oil change, $70 to fill the gas tank up, $200 for insurance. hell yuh bruh I’m about to become the “come scoop me” friend.

1982 2018-08-14 20:01:46 Maybe as edible or as oil.
1983 2018-08-14 20:01:39 I agree I love her but really too much oil, butter and not that healthy
1984 2018-08-14 20:01:28 Inhaling emulsified oil vapour is bad for you? Who knew? 
1985 2018-08-14 20:01:19 It would be madness to stay in Brexit UK. We wouldn't be relying on oil. We have plenty of other things going for us. What onearth makes you think that Scotland,  uniquely in the world couldn't manage? Why do you think we're so crap?
1986 2018-08-14 20:01:05 Yep, hell of a lot of car for your money. Big running costs though, hence the appeal of the oil burner for me.

2000 2018-08-14 19:59:07 1)  external shock in a commodity that an economy needs to import - such as the oil embargo in the 1970s, causing a price increase in gasoline -> fertilizer -> food -> and labor through union cost of living contracts.

2011 2018-08-14 19:57:27 @SaudiEmbassyUSA has imprisoned its citizens for speaking out against rights abuses, then flogs them to death. I would be ashamed as a Canadian if we didn’t speak out. We shouldn’t buy their oil.
2012 2018-08-14 19:57:25 Let’s say you are a Saudi Prince with $70b of dirty oil money just burning a hole in your Thawb. Why would you blow it on a car company like $TSLA that has never shown the ability to make a profit?  Makes no sense.

2017 2018-08-14 19:56:38 During my car’s oil change today they wanted to replace the air filter ($30). I just told them, “no” because I’ve gotten tired telling them I have one in my closet (which I do-$9.00 from amazon, for the last 6 months).
2018 2018-08-14 19:56:33 TBH if you've been "blessed" with the superfinefluffyhair bit of EDS I don't know how well hair oil would go. I'm assuming it'd be a chip-pan hair situation as too heavy for fragile hair even used sparingly. Also, massaging own head? "Ow, my shoulder/elbow/wrist/finger/neck!" 
2019 2018-08-14 19:56:26 i forgot, i also put almond oil on my stretch marks!! it makes them all pretty and shiny
2020 2018-08-14 19:56:12 The most beautiful thing is that Bibi  is no great statesman.  He is a child who is indulged by the military industrial complex who need weapons testing and a beachhead to protect, near the oil and as such is as expendable  to them as Gaddafi and Saddam.
2021 2018-08-14 19:55:54 Most at times I see u jacking at night there,I was motivated to even do more,bt u never told me no be by excess jacking 
2022 2018-08-14 19:55:47 Dollars for the people. Dollars for the gov come from oil. Now, how can the gov get its hands on the former and take advantage of it as it has done with latter. Remittances!!!!

2026 2018-08-14 19:54:50 Its called economics bro. Lemme explain it in simpler terms :The crude oil prices has metamorped into a quagmire of riparian lebdity. This has caused the dow Jones industrial index to oscillate into a punjabian magnanity leading to a condition economists call xegnotism.
2027 2018-08-14 19:54:44 @CiBabs Female mechanic here. My advice to other women, learn the basics of your car. Learn how to change a flat tire, check your own oil and all other fluids. Get a repair manual or Google just to learn the basics. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. @SXMOctane
2028 2018-08-14 19:54:30 Oil prices edged lower on Tuesday, weighed down by a strengthening  U.S. dollar as investors remained concerned about the financial crisis  in Turkey.

2052 2018-08-14 19:50:48 Totally because we are not doing anything about Israel who are killing Palestinians. Because we have nothing to gain 

Kill Sadam and Gaddafi get Gold and Oil in return.
2053 2018-08-14 19:50:26 Not a big beer guy anymore, but think I will buy some and give it away.
2054 2018-08-14 19:50:21 I'm pretty sure that we in the Fox News bubble trust oil company executives and right wing politicians for our science, not pointy headed book learners who have spent decades learning their expertise, thank you.
2055 2018-08-14 19:50:16 Doesn't drax burn imported wood?brought by ships burning heavy fuel oil
2056 2018-08-14 19:50:13 Guys are so mf cute when it comes to shit like that, I asked 2 other guys and they were like "the things for the oil on your face" "oil paper" HAAHAAHSHWKKXNSJD
2057 2018-08-14 19:50:11 I've started testing out oil pastels like last week and still have no clue how to work with them but it's fun! thank you 
2058 2018-08-14 19:50:08 Yaar even your charts show inflation going down! And even oil is cheaper in your chart now when this govt took over. You are wilfully choosing to deny everything based on frivolous conspiracy theories.
2059 2018-08-14 19:49:57 Lol u12 too we d bomb
2060 2018-08-14 19:49:51 I have an essential oil diffuser- why am I not self actualized yet?
2061 2018-08-14 19:49:22 Someone isn't patient waiting for an oil change lol. Then again I'm super patient. Haha
2062 2018-08-14 19:49:20 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
2063 2018-08-14 19:49:12 I love the way this aloe vera gel mix I made feels on my scalp for my pre-poo. I’m mixing it with olive oil to use as a sealant.

2065 2018-08-14 19:49:02 Oh, and HRC was pro-fracking & took Big Oil money. How the hell is that enticing to a Green?
2066 2018-08-14 19:48:43 A spat between a Nigerian and a Somali, both black presumably,  is Trump's fault? 
The radicalization of Somalis occurred under Obama who had a soft approach. 
The ideology itself views kindness a weakness to be exploited.  A kinder gentler approach, unwise
2067 2018-08-14 19:48:38 I keep cans of sardines in olive oil at my desk at all times, better than a vending machine or fast food! #LCHF #Keto
2068 2018-08-14 19:48:03 This is what happens when you home brew hash oil
2069 2018-08-14 19:48:00 not so...albertans remember the NEP! government of alberta has strong connections with Saudi Arabia....ie investments in alberta oil sands etc.

• manager almost dropped a case w $500 worth of shit in it 

im beat and im shift isnt even close to over
2072 2018-08-14 19:47:39 Dealing with entrepreneurs in the oil industry is not about fighting against economic interests.
They are selfish, materialistic and have no heart.

2083 2018-08-14 19:46:48 A guy at the pool was rubbing oil on his gf’s butt and then happily laid his cheek on it...i need that in my life

2087 2018-08-14 19:46:34 "Perfect." Rabastan said as he rubbed the oil against his hands before he began to rub her shoulders and upper back area, humming softly to himself. "How's the pressure?"
2088 2018-08-14 19:46:32 Thank you Martin Heinrich, we do need to save our state from the Republican carpet baggers. The oil fields are poisoning us and the water in Lea County.

2096 2018-08-14 19:45:14 I love this oil why cause I don’t have to go out in the pouring rain to go to work
2097 2018-08-14 19:45:08 I hate when females make captions for their pic talking about the glow on their skin knowing they just lathered their face wit baby oil... you not glowing dumb dumb you greasy
2098 2018-08-14 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2099 2018-08-14 19:45:04 @DrJacksonUK is your baobab and Rose oil suitable for pregnant women?
2100 2018-08-14 19:44:38 All the @Tesla engineers who work there because they dream of a world without oil will probably really like working directly for the Saudis. Good move @elonmusk
2101 2018-08-14 19:44:35 I am praying for : 
* our Senate to repeal YOUR law you pushed through that says its legal to drill oil in one of tbe TOP 3 breeding grounds for polar bears , porcupine caribou and many many types of birds in the world. 
I pray you dont get your wish to kill off those animals.
2102 2018-08-14 19:44:12 Lunch time I made a tart full of cherry tomatoes,  griddled slices of courgette,  lumps of goats cheese, chopped spring onions a few basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Was yum. #courgetteglut
2103 2018-08-14 19:44:02 the hodlers and OG vestal virgins must be mocked and shunned as to learn their lesson, its good for them, I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. lesson learned...
2104 2018-08-14 19:43:51 *wonders if I could make it to Nola even tho I need an oil change*
2105 2018-08-14 19:43:50 If you fry steak in oil, then add water (kaboom! what did you think would happen?!), don’t then act surprised when I close the door to stop the stench spreading through the flat.
2106 2018-08-14 19:43:25 Wow. So I just picked up a bunch of really good CBD vape oil, and this stuff is incredible. Feels amazing too! I think with this I might finally be able to kick my cigarette habit!
2107 2018-08-14 19:43:10 Free? 
If you ignore rebates,  tax deferments, paying ppl to use up excess production and subsidies in direct payments.  
In many cases the payback on these projects exceeds useful lifespan of equipment. 
Btwn 20 n 30 yrs you will be using same panel?
2108 2018-08-14 19:43:07 I've had my current car for for over 10 years and have never ever checked oil, water, tyres or anything.
2109 2018-08-14 19:42:41 Wow, this image. At first I thought it was an oil painting, reminiscent of Rembrandt.
2110 2018-08-14 19:42:28 Small kayla achievements but I was able to schedule my own oil change appointment without a friend or my mom helping me LOL
2111 2018-08-14 19:42:26 I make a recipe with a little bit of oil on bottom of crust, which makes it extra-crisp. Ideal for pan pizza from a cast-iron skillet at home.
2112 2018-08-14 19:42:21 Digital snake oil, neither more nor less.
2113 2018-08-14 19:42:16 For 6, 2 eggs, equal quantities by volume of strong flour and milk, plus an extra tablespoon of flour, whisk, sieve. Tray in the oven at 200 for ages, sunflower oil once the tray is hot, 20 more mins in the oven, batter in, don't open the door until done.
2114 2018-08-14 19:42:11 Controversial opinion.

Mayo is fine, it's just eggs oil and vinegar. Its good as an ingredient. Aoili is amazing. I just don't want it SLATHERED in stuff. Or as the main star in a dish 
2115 2018-08-14 19:42:08 Got to love all of that soothing cade and rose oil in that beauty and think of all the plastic that'll be saved! 
2116 2018-08-14 19:41:57 Oil in a bag! OKAY THEN
2117 2018-08-14 19:41:54 That was really bad. I'm thinking of BP, too, and the CEO who said he'd rather be racing his yacht than dealing with an oil spill. #RaganChat
2118 2018-08-14 19:41:48 I got my first oil change on my own today. I’m 28.5.
2119 2018-08-14 19:41:46 Future beats and hip hop?... yep, you should seek therapy, that's like trying to mix water and oil.
2120 2018-08-14 19:41:45 Can someone tell me how to calm my turtle down?! It keeps barking bro. I try teaching her tricks but canola oil never learns ANYTHING!!!!
2121 2018-08-14 19:41:45 No no Rahul, you gave  the Modi govt an empty bankrupt treasury....banks were undercapitalized 80%, no money for ordinary working capital even. For e.g. you had an outstanding worh 50,000cr to Iran for oil bills.... just catch up is an issue
2122 2018-08-14 19:41:36 2/ Cré are helping the industry- if all food service items were compostable it would give a much better high quality recyclable plastics for recycling- I think the traditional oil based packaging industry in UK and Eu are nervous of Ireland  we are leading the way here
2123 2018-08-14 19:41:36 As I said, why should we care what other fans say about us? 
'You're not a big club.' - but we're the champions, that's all that mtters
'Emptyhad' - but we got 100 beautiful points last season
Oil money - but we're self sustaining and have been pretty much for 5 years
etc.
2124 2018-08-14 19:41:35 Oh....And I forgot the home-made coleslaw, corn on the cob (rubbed with chilli oil) and ...."Fireball pineapple" (I'll let you Google this one ;)))

2129 2018-08-14 19:40:55 Anyone know why oil changes take 2 hours?
2130 2018-08-14 19:40:54 turn your heat down. use lots of oil in the pan (olive is good, you can use butter or bacon fat but both burn and stick and should be cut with oil) and start the eggs in the pan cold. eggs stick and seize up really easy
2131 2018-08-14 19:40:49 6k for hot oil treatment, a scam
2132 2018-08-14 19:40:45 But Jamaican black castor oil is deadass $3 and it revived my edges just fine  rich ppl just like to waste money
2133 2018-08-14 19:40:41 I don't think the FBI would get involved since it's happening here in Canada,maybe your CIA knows what's going on. They erased the tweet,but are recalling their ambassadors and any students studying in Canada. It's time for us to get off Saudi oil.

2136 2018-08-14 19:40:31 Venezuela's main problem is that their economy is almost exclusively dependent on its oil reserves. They had more issues contributing to their failures than an expansion of social programs.
2137 2018-08-14 19:40:26 You guys sell cbd oil?
2138 2018-08-14 19:40:25 Ok if you suggest.
In the end we can mix some indelible ink with oil and give them a bath 
2139 2018-08-14 19:40:18 Go ahead and tell me peanut butter isn't gross. It's concentrated nut flavored oil.

2141 2018-08-14 19:40:08 I have a nutty smell thanks to the castor oil on my scalp.
2142 2018-08-14 19:40:06 I tried Avacado eggs olive oil and mayo mixed and it helped lol. Eggs can be a substitute for a protein treatment

2145 2018-08-14 19:39:53 Marinated steaks! Lots of worcestershire, olive oil and rosemary
2146 2018-08-14 19:39:41 No. They bit into the vegetable oil at the top so it was tossed too.

2150 2018-08-14 19:39:17 Broken rear shock seal? via /r/motorcycle

I brought my bike to the shop knowing the bump stop was broke and the guy says my shock seal broke and leaked some oil and that it has to be fixed. Said he can’t find any replacement parts online but will talk to people who work wit…
2151 2018-08-14 19:39:16 Although the sector is unregulated and many don't pay VAT or tax, they contribute £800M to the economy in what the workers spend. With robots that money would go to the oil companies like BP, Esso and Shell.

2153 2018-08-14 19:39:10 Ladies and gentlemen...If you’re the type of person that haggles a car down to invoice price and then follow it up with “ I wanna feel like I’m getting a good deal here can you throw in a years worth of oil changes” you’ve effectively asked me to pay you to buy that car
2154 2018-08-14 19:39:07 Went to get an oil change for Bandit & the guy handed the pen to terrell to sign the document & Terrell went “ nah that’s all her ” & the man apologized for assuming that it was his and said “ I’m sorry I know you’re really the boss here”  GAHDAMN RIGHT IM A BOSS GUY

2162 2018-08-14 19:38:05 Random Fact
Oil is measured in barrels. (A barrel is 42 gallons. 1 gallon is 3.78litres)
How did this happen? First oil well-Drake well was drilled in Pennysilvania USA. It was scooped in all sorts of containers. Cheating was rampant, till it was decided to standardise the barrel

2165 2018-08-14 19:37:58 Check out the truth about cancer for some power house cancer fighting info. One of my natural cures was 3 tbs cottage cheese and 3 tbs fresh refrigerated barlean flaxseed oil (mix with immersion blender) it's a 1930s recipe and it works!
2166 2018-08-14 19:37:35 What does Saudi Arabia (2nd largest oil producer) want with an electric car maker (@Tesla) - when they manufacture a vast majority of the worlds oil supplies again?
2167 2018-08-14 19:37:23 He pulled u out of a recession but landed u into slavery. In 3 years PMB has amassed a debt of 20trillion Naira.Ratio of debt to GDP now at 24.1% from 14% & we now service our debts with 66% of our revenues(JAMB,Oil & customs revenues go here).Your grandchildren are in trouble.
2168 2018-08-14 19:37:19 Decentralized? Very questionable statement. Better fundamentals? Do share, I'd love to read this. Nah, I'm telling YOU, that YOU bought and hold snake oil = $XRP
2169 2018-08-14 19:37:16 Been here for over an hour for an oil change i could have done in less than 15
2170 2018-08-14 19:37:07 If only we set up a sovereign wealth fund from north sea oil revenue, and if we had forced councils to reinvest money from council house sales into social housing we’d be in a better position......

2172 2018-08-14 19:36:54 Went to get an oil change, dude saw my shirt and hat pins and I guess he put two and two together cuz he said my total was cheap enough that I could still buy some bud when it’s done 
2173 2018-08-14 19:36:44 When are we going to enjoy the Oil been drilled by @TullowOilplc? When will the fuel prices go down?
2174 2018-08-14 19:36:43 Trump...make Russia rich...everything he does from tariffs globally, ending the Iran Nuclear Deal to oil makes Russian economy grow
2175 2018-08-14 19:36:42 And people are protesting against a #KinderMorgan pipeline that provides a much safer and closer monitored way of transporting oil/fuel. This spill will decimate the rivers ecosystem as it travels down river into the ocean.
2176 2018-08-14 19:36:34 Off-topic but when did we stop storing the Strategic Oil Reserve in Trey Gowdy's hair?
2177 2018-08-14 19:36:25 Yeh man, as long as it's synthetic and seal safe chuck it in, it's usually a wee bit cheaper, I managed to get my juice lubes oil reduced to a tenner though from 73 Degrees in Bristol so not bad
2178 2018-08-14 19:36:25 I poured squash in the frying pan and added oil to my glass. I also spend most of my life looking for keys
2179 2018-08-14 19:36:15 It felt like daylight robbery...but it's a once per year thing, except the oil change. And it's over now. Trying to get Sci ready for the road trip in September.
2180 2018-08-14 19:36:15 Why is there no National Energy policy to ensure that Canada is self sufficient instead of selling all our oil for a pittance compared to what we are paying for imported oil?

2188 2018-08-14 19:35:36 Well well, if only these people can show you their payslip, you'll understand that the oil industry is overrated (your pay depends on who you work for).

2190 2018-08-14 19:35:32 Then when you see them that’s all they wanna talk about. No ones buying your magic snake oil fam
2191 2018-08-14 19:35:29 Holding a trash panda back from a summer refreshment, I see.  It should be noted that they do not appear to be a fan of vegetable oil.  That was left neatly on the shelf.
2192 2018-08-14 19:35:15 Let’s say it’s 5 minutes - everyday for a year is just about 1 day. All that for an oil block!??? Come-on!!!
2193 2018-08-14 19:35:13 They put me in Facebook jail for mentioning CBD OIL, which is LEGAL in all 50 States! They then deleted my posts on a specific LEGAL local CBD Wellness Center. Yes, seriously! #CBD #Facebook
2194 2018-08-14 19:35:07 When people start selling CBD oil I instantly block them. Like shut up no one cares
2195 2018-08-14 19:35:04 Beyond grateful for having a father that taught me about cars. Just discovered my oil beyond low thanks to all the commuting I’ve been doing. Time to step up my tune up game.
2196 2018-08-14 19:35:01 @TomPerez it is a terrible mistake to accept corporate oil money. It is hypocritical and a damn shame.
2197 2018-08-14 19:34:55 While I know internet of everything I’m now learning oil and gas because they are looking for oil in the north
2198 2018-08-14 19:34:54 I’m convinced the @WhiteHouse wishes to be the new Southfork ranch because at this point they’ve dug such a deep pit they should’ve struck oil.  #Resistance #Omarosa #Trump

2202 2018-08-14 19:34:15 Charlie Angus:  How are all your socialist programs going to be paid for if we keep the oil in the ground, refuse to sell weapons to countries that buy them.  Put small businesses out of business by raising the minimum wage so high they can't afford to hire anyone.
2203 2018-08-14 19:34:05 How is that new when my science teacher taught the Ice Age cycle in the 60's?

During the 15000 years of peak ice the seas are 120M lower (growing forests on some ocean floor that will become oil) and the Sahara is a forest

2209 2018-08-14 19:32:54 And who gains from the oil coming from Turkana now that its clear its not the common mwananchi?
2210 2018-08-14 19:32:52 In addition to @Peters_Glen excellent thread on explaining the virtual effects of GoO, to your question on oil in heating - that is banned from 2020.
2211 2018-08-14 19:32:40 China removes 25% tariff on oil. Where's CNN? #MAGA. Pass it on to any Middle Class Negro or White Liberal. We win. Establishment (#RINOs & #Democrats) loses.
2212 2018-08-14 19:32:34 Yeah it’s synthetic 15wt Moto x fork oil...
2213 2018-08-14 19:32:33 2 and do whatever Mango Mussolini wants.  A deal with various oil, gas and mining corporations to plunder our public lands and pollute our air and water in exchange for campaign contributions.  Lots of deals, folks!
2214 2018-08-14 19:32:29 We found the snake but ain't buying no oil!!
2215 2018-08-14 19:32:27 We all joined the UN with the idea to strive towards specific human rights, & they plainly flout that. FFS, they're in the middle of a 3 year term on the UNHRC! Yet the USA/EU refuse to have Canada's back! Why? Oil interests. Arms deals. It's blood money, & it's hypocritical. 5/7
2216 2018-08-14 19:32:13 Fair enough
2217 2018-08-14 19:32:12 I tell ya what Jim. My family has been in Virginia since there was a Virginia. And if you really believe in your candidate, let's make a bet. 

If Corey loses, you tweet out "Corey Stewart is a massive loser. He should put his snake oil in his carpet bag and hitchhike back to MN"
2218 2018-08-14 19:32:09 It was a stupid example because it was a stupid example.

Oil is traded in dollars. That essentially means the U.S. gets its foreign oil for free. That's not fair either. The world is full of things that aren't fair. Starting a counter productive trade war that will harm America
2219 2018-08-14 19:32:09 Of course you are vegan, but mayo's oil keeps a hamburger bun from getting soggy.

2223 2018-08-14 19:31:43 Also, please reconsider American involvement with Saudi Arabia, with the oil & military industrial complex-fuelled trade deals, which only enable one of the most brutal regimes, & further allows them to terrorize Yemen (amongst others). 3/7

2237 2018-08-14 19:29:32 I originally wanted it to to be cum and squirt but that’s not allowed. So I guess a damn nice olive oil!
2238 2018-08-14 19:29:27 30 hrs into a game of #factorio and the have only found a single oil which had 70% yield
2239 2018-08-14 19:29:16 A drop of olive oil and lemon juice to an ice cube then running it over your face gives you better results than some most skin care products
2240 2018-08-14 19:29:08 and in the 80s I was taxed at up to 80% working on an oil rig to try and raise a deposit on a house to pay up to 15% interest, that's a lot of money earned that I never saw. Now I have to work an extra year and my wife an extra 7. Add all that up in money 
2241 2018-08-14 19:28:43 Trump already set up soy sales to EU, china is already backing down on oil. They can't hold out for long. We have 300billion a year trade deficits with them. They tarriff our goods way more then we do theirs. Smarten up, think about it. We can't lose. That's why stocks are good
2242 2018-08-14 19:28:31 Ze worden niet gered. Tesla (Elon Musk) heeft het niet nodig, maar wil het wel graag. Big Oil in het midden-oosten heeft al even geleden ingezien dat het anders moet. Ze zijn daar ook goed bezig met enorme zonneparken. Het lijkt mij een mooie stap.
2243 2018-08-14 19:28:21 Hey, who stirred up the pot! Read some history, maybe you should be a little more aware why the Middle East hates invaders? Are they attacking countries that didn’t go in and develop their oil? Or try and liberate them  with “democracy” ?
2244 2018-08-14 19:28:10 Hey #tesla - why do people who sell oil want to buy an electric car company?

2247 2018-08-14 19:27:58 Works for big oil
2248 2018-08-14 19:27:56 You make a good point about oil subsidies, however battery chemistry and efficiency are not improving at rates which would be needed to overtake standard liquid fueled vehicles at any time soon.
2249 2018-08-14 19:27:52 He expanded private offshore oil drilling, refused to prosecute Wall Street bankers after the recession. Can you name a Marxist policy that he implemented domestically?

2251 2018-08-14 19:27:18 this goes for everything now, little half caps to 'save plastic' and thin plastic bottles that literally collapse while opening them...like vegetable oil,...how convenient while cooking over a hot stove.  Bullshit!
2252 2018-08-14 19:27:15 Ask yourself this simple question: with so many solar farms and wind technologies working why do we need to open new oil platforms ??  Because the oil extracted did not decreased a single galon,in fact because of 'green' technologies we need now to extract more oil (among others)
2253 2018-08-14 19:27:12 Cbd oil 
2254 2018-08-14 19:27:06 Basic commodities including mealie meal, rice, cooking oil and flour. Prices of these mostly affect the poor who normaly survive on a very narrow diet.
2255 2018-08-14 19:27:04 What I said was Home drown oil protects the environment far more than imported oil across the Oceans. And I stand by that statement as it clearly is. Remember you joined in on the thread. My opinion is just as valid as yours. I am not clogging anything.
2256 2018-08-14 19:26:53 Pump the oil honey
2257 2018-08-14 19:26:43 Nothing makes me more uncomfortable than getting my oil checked for the jeep.. this man is yelling all of these facts at me like I have ANY clue what they mean. “Sounds great, thanks!” 
2258 2018-08-14 19:26:41 This report by Fox is false. Sanctions also created this as did the drug war, CIA, Big Oil, Neo Liberal colonialism and attacks of the right wing government and 1%ers who wanted this outcome.

2265 2018-08-14 19:25:07 Don't believe Canada is demanding the rest of the world stop. Lowering emissions is the goal, and my original response was to LNG not oil. And ya, we should stop using/producing tomorrow and see how well that goes
2266 2018-08-14 19:24:52 rip olive oil

2271 2018-08-14 19:24:14 @Buick - maybe you can help me - went to my  Buick dealer 4 weeks ago for an oil change and tire rotation (2014 Enclave)just found out - that your service center didn’t bother to reset the TPMS- AFTER they rotated my tires - how is this possible ?- how do I get my money BACK ?
2272 2018-08-14 19:24:10 EVERY DAY FOR SHS MUST BE LIKE PUTTING OUT FIRES, IN A TINDERBOX, WITH THE ONLY LIQUID TO HAND BEING OIL.

2278 2018-08-14 19:23:39 Janice, I absolutely agree. And I think trump is attacking her because she’s a better snake oil salesman than he is, beating him at his own game, which also makes him, by design, a less talented low-life than her.
2279 2018-08-14 19:23:34 How can you sit on my bedsheets and eat and then spill oil on it??? Realllyy??
2280 2018-08-14 19:23:04 Call TF tuned. As long as it's the right wt and fully synthetic and seal safe I believe you can use motorbike fork oil. I got some Juice Lubes oil for my Fox forks, was fully prepared to use motorbike oil but couldn't find any handy in 20wt

2285 2018-08-14 19:22:38 You might try CBD oil if it's legal in your state. It has the stress reducing benefits of pot without the negative side effects or the high.
2286 2018-08-14 19:22:35 Can I interest you in an essential oil class?
2287 2018-08-14 19:22:34 We don’t have the tech for being environmentally friendly? I beg to differ. We are an extremely wasteful country and yet we have kids who are starving. We STILL use technology dependent on oil when we have other energy sources that could be utilized. Our recycling is a joke....
2288 2018-08-14 19:22:33 Hemp is one of the most versatile plants there are.
That's why it's being outlawed.
We can find all we need in nature, we don't need oil or it's derivatives.
2289 2018-08-14 19:22:32 Mayo is, in essence, made from some fairly cheap ingredients too, eggs, vinegar, oil of some variety, salt, and the occasional common spices. I can make my own mayo on  the cheap of I so desired, which a lot of folks my age do, as blending themselves saves a few dollars.
2290 2018-08-14 19:22:30 Oil companies are lining up to participate in the carbon tax. Why would my money be with collaborators?
2291 2018-08-14 19:22:30 Salad: arugula, cannelini beans, sliced sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese, red wine vinegar/oil.  1 can beans to 1 plastic container of arugula - about 4 people I think.
Hummus (Zahav recipe) or baba ghanoush (Tyler Florence recipe).
2292 2018-08-14 19:22:23 For weeks oil future prices have stuttered, remaining the same. Obvious manipulation. Every time it falls due to oversupply and decreasing demand, buys mysteriously appear to shore up prices. Usually the Kochs exchange in London.
2293 2018-08-14 19:22:18 Get this off my screen until you come ‘clean.’  This twaddle has to be sponsored by the oil & gas industry who have been treating us like dumb clucks for decades.  Hopefully those days are over.

2299 2018-08-14 19:21:53 You didnt understand rigth ? Oil, coal, gas , etc.. continue to be extracted , but  now with ''green' technologies we need to extract those materials even more ..

"Without petrolium we can not build any of the 'green' technologies"
2300 2018-08-14 19:21:53 Im down. But you MUST oil up
2301 2018-08-14 19:21:49 Yeah for the last few yearsss, but I also have these crazy ass ankle, knee and back pains I have to deal with everyday. And honestly, I’d rather smoke weed or use weed oil over taking a shit ton of opioids to make it go away. I don’t wanna do it to get fucked up, or do crazy

2304 2018-08-14 19:21:30 I understand that's what you would like to see irrespective of the cost. Few Canadians agree. If we alone stopped pumping oil and gas tomorrow it wouldn't make any difference in the climate and you must surely know that. What's your plan for real emitters like China and Russia?
2305 2018-08-14 19:21:27 I don't recall the conservatives spending $15+ billion dollars on buying and expanding an oil pipeline to the west coast do you? And I say this as a life long liberal voter... (well ex liberal voter now)
2306 2018-08-14 19:21:17 Why can't we refine turkana oil to save us landed cost shenanigans
2307 2018-08-14 19:21:02 The mental image of Junior Galette and Adrian Peterson fighting each other with belts on the 50-yard line in the superdome makes me wish I could paint. That scene deserves a giant canvas and the finest oil paints.

2309 2018-08-14 19:20:42 Guys I’m upset! I just changed my oil and it cost $50 like wtf?? My family said it’d be like $30ish. Apparently my car came with expensive oil in it that’s so not fair
2310 2018-08-14 19:20:36 My son (12) wrote to ‘  jaffercakes 2day to tell them how betrayed he felt when he saw they are made using palm oil. He sent them the animation as well , big up to the young activist.

2312 2018-08-14 19:20:10 Eh I don't agree at all, if the abuse was mutual or whatever no one has the right to play victim over the other. I can't slap you today and play the victim when you throw boiling oil on me . My opinion

2325 2018-08-14 19:19:04 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

1. Sachajuan Normalizing Shampoo

2. Redken Scalp.Relief Oil Detox
3  L'Oreal Elvive: must use hydrating conditioner once a week if you use this product
2332 2018-08-14 19:18:08 I’ll concur with the Himalayan salt lamp, tea tree oil and family guy collection. That’s assuming you’re not just really chilled in a customers sitting room! #TradesTalk

2338 2018-08-14 19:17:08 HB 331 is the only bill this past year where House R's made a difference. Ironically, it also was one of the fiscally most irresponsible. It bailed out certain oil co's only by kicking the costs down the road to future AKs. Where there are choices, vote for challengers. #akleg
2339 2018-08-14 19:16:58 I know many of you’ve had rough days, and that sucks.

2347 2018-08-14 19:16:06 Took a tour of Fort MacKay once with a bunch of band leaders up there. They spent several hours touring us around, complaining, and pointing out how the oil sands had ruined their traditional way of life. Then we went and had a meeting in their $30 million community Center...
2348 2018-08-14 19:15:54 Why #iransanctions - it’s a catalyst for oil prices going up to $150 meaning friends of @realDonaldTrump the Saudis can earn more to pay for the arms they are sold by @realDonaldTrump
2349 2018-08-14 19:15:53 AG pro you have to ask for it at the pharmacy ! And start using pm styling oil in your hair after you wash it and I’ve been using Amika intense repair mask when i condition ! And try to stay away from using hot tools!

2352 2018-08-14 19:15:43 and they also have products with no beeswax or honey like the soy wax melts and acne scrub/rosehip oil it seems like you just want to argue bc most of these brands on this list not just burt’s bees sell both non vegan and vegan options

2358 2018-08-14 19:14:53 I bet money since im here for a oil change they gon try to get me to buy sumn else too.
2359 2018-08-14 19:14:45 But Luigi from my local pizzeria told me this is very old recipe and they only make it for special customers (like me). Guess it is the same as with the Spanish olive oil they sell us in Italian bottles and the indulgences they sold to my ancestors...
2360 2018-08-14 19:14:43 They just told me it would take an hour for an oil change HA
2361 2018-08-14 19:14:42 Omg yes I got some too and it was so expensive! But honestly it’s like you’re paying for pure quality oil so they gone charge 
2362 2018-08-14 19:14:40 I started using the oil in June, and the results are amazing 
2363 2018-08-14 19:14:40 I SOOO wish that would actually happen. But Saudi oil money buys alot of influence in this country unfortunately
2364 2018-08-14 19:14:38 im just going to bake the peppers, put oil on them, so theyre not raw, and make the filling on the stovetop and then just fill them.
2365 2018-08-14 19:14:36 Top tip.....dont splash chilli, lemon  and garlic olive oil in your eyes
2366 2018-08-14 19:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.

2369 2018-08-14 19:14:17 It takes me approx 15 mins to brush my teeth... I have to do the coconut oil pull first then wait 10 mins after to brush. After brushing I use mouth wash, then I floss and after that a peroxide rinse.. I literally haven't been to a dentist since I was 12 
2370 2018-08-14 19:14:15 Wordt Tesla nu gered door Big Oil, of zet Big Oil een verduurzamende stap door in Tesla te investeren?

2376 2018-08-14 19:13:48 wtf is even the point of food if it's not literally dripping in oyl? I want oil all OVER my face and hands and to stain the shirts of anyone who even looks at me
2377 2018-08-14 19:13:31 Somebody will think it one of those jokes there is oil in South Africa I found the place I was standing on it it dripping but I won't show anyone because they will remove people close by and make it nature reserve
2378 2018-08-14 19:13:25 In theory it should work, light oil in a pan may work if the oven doesn’t.
2379 2018-08-14 19:13:21 Available lg ke muji oil
2380 2018-08-14 19:13:04 I like jojoba or tsubaki oil. We should have some in the vendor area for sale.

2384 2018-08-14 19:12:35 Have loved all your books, Gov in charge of most things is little better than big oil. Look at Detroit & Chicago the poor blacks have suffered terribly. Welfare is not the answer. Family, Education & Jobs.  Viet Vet Bob & wife Theresa
2385 2018-08-14 19:12:31 Not true. Oil was nationalized in 1976. Get your facts right. Hugo Chávez was a dictator. He destroyed the institutions and the economy to suppor a socialist utopia that now has ruined us the Venezuelan people. #SocialismKills

2395 2018-08-14 19:10:46 But seriously, a tincture of CBD oil REALLY intensifies Kratom.
2396 2018-08-14 19:10:37 Isn't is also easier for them to raise dollars through their massive oil and gas reserves?  They aren't a heavily indebted nation/society, so they can make this choice and deal with the consequences much more easily than other countries.
2397 2018-08-14 19:10:37    still haven't figured out why the man was naked and dipped in oil.

2412 2018-08-14 19:09:43 Yep, and $EEM another horrendous looking chart that's clinging to a key support level. I was reading that if oil goes up due to Iran sanctions, problems get even bigger for EM and Europe.

2416 2018-08-14 19:09:10 As someone who was born with holes in his eardrums, has had multiple surgeries, and constantly had ear infects growing up, I suggest Wally’s Ear Oil, and then stuff a cotton ball dipped in frankincense oil into the infected ear. Clean and repeat every hour.

Think Oil Lamps, Old Water Pumps, Griddles, Wash Boards, Tin Baths so on and so forth.

2430 2018-08-14 19:07:44 Highly ironic considering the kingpins of the oil industry (Saudi Arabia) are the prospective buyers here - Whose to say they are interested in growing EV's? Many occurrences in history of big established industries buying companies to stifle commercialization of their IP.
2431 2018-08-14 19:07:42 When the left media people are infiltrators to  get  info to  stop grass roots  movements & protests  is rather shocking. It's shocking when they help out the CIA,  the  FBI & an oil company. Yet RT just wanted to sow  discord it  looks like & it wasnt about  the  oil.
2432 2018-08-14 19:07:41 People ask me for money now n then. If I have it I help out, but I’d never talk down to my own n tell them get a job. I was poor once too. I remember the struggle. If you have a lot of oil or casino money, be nice. Being rich isn’t about money. It’s about character.
2433 2018-08-14 19:07:36 Of course, how would you coordinate a massive strike against “the new oil” without using it? Much like the consumerism/fossil dilemma this must be resolved and not by creating “green” alternative products, either
2434 2018-08-14 19:07:29 Oil is just oil by itself....

When it hits the hands and heads of the anointed....

It becomes super natural
2435 2018-08-14 19:07:26 Gotta change these brakes this weekend nd give this bitch a oil change !! 
2436 2018-08-14 19:07:25 Give and it Shall be given. You cannot continue to have tight fists when it comes to giving. And open hands when it comes to receiving. That's like oil and water it just doesn't mix.
2437 2018-08-14 19:07:25 “I gotta get an oil change soon”

2440 2018-08-14 19:07:13 i’ve been sitting here waiting for my oil change to be done for an hour now 
2441 2018-08-14 19:06:57 The climate crisis is here -- there's no scientific debate on that anymore. We need to keep as much oil as we can underground if we're to avoid absolute catastrophe. Canada already sells its resources. The point is to wean off #fossilfuels, not ramp up.
2442 2018-08-14 19:06:46 Needs a call but i know what it means. Its in reference to the girls he was dancing with after Edu chased him away from where Jaber was getting a lappie from Mr. Baby Oil.

2446 2018-08-14 19:06:32 Sorry the logic is flawed. I don’t know if Musk is right but Big Oil aren’t one Mind. Some might choose to hedge against oil-transport by investing electric-transport. Some  will invest more heavily in ICE or refining efficiency or/and hire hundreds of lobbyist, spread rumors..
2447 2018-08-14 19:06:30 In Civil war they weren't really fighting to kill just to incapacitate. That's shown when ant man accidentally threw an oil tanker and Cap looked at him weirdly. Reason why Spider-Man was called in. To web them up but not really get physical
2448 2018-08-14 19:06:25 This girl in the group chat calling Nicki an abuser like she didn’t throw a GLASS coconut oil jar at the back of her nigga’s head and lock him out her room when we lived together. I literally had to offer him a towel for the blood. Make it make sense.

2450 2018-08-14 19:06:19 It helps the oil barons - who are clued up and realise they’ll need something else to drive their economy when the oil runs out (see UAE skyscrapers/tourism, Emirates airlines, etc) and I’m sure Elon musk will make some serious bank too. Don’t think it helps anyone else though

2457 2018-08-14 19:05:15 Welpppp, do I stay fly to get an oil change or change into some chill gear...? 
2458 2018-08-14 19:05:06 I'm not going to waste my time with you. So I will keep it simple. Petrofac will design then build the project via contractor then turn it to the Iraqi Basra Oil Company to operate. Contractor can be Iraqi or any other nationality. By law, 80% of workforce has to be Iraqi.

2460 2018-08-14 19:04:58 Over the Top with Sylvester Stallone; he was an arm wrestler; one of his opponents drank motor oil. If I win a prize; please give it to someone who can use it; I live too far away to claim it!
2461 2018-08-14 19:04:56 Question for people who know about cars. 
I have a 2016 Nissan. When I have to get an oil change/tire rotation should I continue to go to the Nissan dealership? Or is it safe to go to a (reputable) round-the-way place
2462 2018-08-14 19:04:54 Because the USSR didn't resist CIA meddling? I don't remember a hot war between the USA and the USSR.

Ahhh here come the personal insults. Also, if someone goes into a country for oil they don't then leave that country while the oil fields are still rich.
2463 2018-08-14 19:04:52 How old is that oil that they are using?  It shouldn't be dark brown.
2464 2018-08-14 19:04:49 Of course I will.

In coconut oil.

2485 2018-08-14 19:02:13 The label is unimportant when it's just a different brand of the same product. Majority of these ppl are just useful idiots adding to the chaos. "Nazis," supremists and the tools motivated to oppose them are just players in an elaborate coordinated production
2486 2018-08-14 19:02:04 A primary value of the dollar these days is as a reserve currency for the petroleum industry - a status that has allowed them to print currency willy-nilly without inflation. USA went to war in Iraq to prevent them starting an oil bourse trading in Euro. Possible it's intentional
2487 2018-08-14 19:02:03 Did You Know? Every ton of recycled office paper saves 380 gallons of oil.

2516 2018-08-14 18:59:24 Good. So you except UK onshore oil is a far safer bet for the environment I take it? But you know what? I bet you don't. I bet you don't want hydro carbons full stop. Dream on. But majority of people don't want to go back to the Horse & Cart and candle light.

2518 2018-08-14 18:59:18 Sorry. 

No can do.

The USA has a trade war going on with Canada, and Canada has been looking for other buyers for its oil. In the fact, the government even bought a pipeline to tidewater on Canadian soil to ensure exports bypassing the USA.
2519 2018-08-14 18:59:18 Ambergris: various nuances of woody, dry balsamic,

Oil doesn’t have a ‘monetary premium’ because it’s trivial to quickly increase production and inflate everyone *if* they start using it as a SoV
2526 2018-08-14 18:57:49 I straight up didn't know ppl put oil and vinegar on their sammiches until I moved to the east coast. I was soooo confused

2528 2018-08-14 18:57:36 getting an oil change in a small town is an experience. literally walked in to give them my keys, they knew which car was mine already without me even telling them, and were like “you can chill in our office i don’t care”. nothing like it.
2529 2018-08-14 18:57:36 Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy just store the peanut butter with oil upside down until you r ready to use. Then turn right side up. Easy to stir and almost mixed.

2543 2018-08-14 18:56:19 Every time I see how much the government takes from my paycheck I’m reminded how fucking useless they are. 80% of taxes go straight to stuff I don’t believe in.

2560 2018-08-14 18:54:38 If people being hurt was the price to keep the oil Westminster would openly encourage it. They don’t give a flying fcuk for their own serfs why would they give two shits for us. First and foremost the Tories are Imperialists, they don’t do deals they subjugate. Look at Brexit.

2590 2018-08-14 18:50:47 That's not a good comparison to make considering that there are details left out. She said Zendaya smelled like Patchouli oil (not Coconut) and weed because she had locks. That situation was a cultural/race issue...so no the hypocrisy did not jump out.
2591 2018-08-14 18:50:44 She's smaller than you might think.

2599 2018-08-14 18:49:32 I did and I don't need to prove anything to you. In my original post I mentioned the drop in oil prices in the 80s to counter your argument. In other words, the current situation in Vzla was not caused by fluctuations in oil price.

2605 2018-08-14 18:48:57 The oil companies own the infrastructure, the oil is in Uk waters so I would say that the UK own the oil that is why we give them a licence so they can drill, but after independence :-) :-) :-)

2608 2018-08-14 18:48:52 We'll use oil, but not to the extent that an export market qill ready for this pipeline at full capacity.

2% of the world's cars being sold this year are electric, and that market share is rapidly growing.
2609 2018-08-14 18:48:39 IS IT WARM THERE IN THE POCKET OF BIG OIL?!?!?!?
2610 2018-08-14 18:48:35 I have been asked a number of times this week what's happening at the corner of highways 3 & 13. The answer is Imperial Oil is completing remediation work on the site. That's all that's taking place at this point. #carmanecodev
2611 2018-08-14 18:48:33 explain to the people how you can deal with an oil spill but not red tide ?
2612 2018-08-14 18:48:29 Can you explain why our prices in kenya are going yet in the international Market, Crude oil price has gone down

2617 2018-08-14 18:47:47 Mayo is basically eggs and oil.  In moderation it’s probably healthier than the bread it’s usually spread on.

2624 2018-08-14 18:47:02 Without the oil lobby and govt subsidies, the battery technology and EVs would have already been light year ahead and completely mainstream. It’s just that oil trades in USD worldwide...
2625 2018-08-14 18:47:02 You have to sell your oil to survive.
2626 2018-08-14 18:47:01 Yes there’s gas and oil coming out of Florida. Years upon years ago back in the early 90s they wanted to put platforms out in the keys but we voted against it.
2627 2018-08-14 18:46:58 They're going to play the victim to stimulate more snake oil sales.
2628 2018-08-14 18:46:56 Damn.. best I’m gettin is like 25 on a good day, and I feel you on that oil burn hahaha
2629 2018-08-14 18:46:53 Ain't that the truth.

Unfortunate Reagan & trickledown got a boost from the decline in oil prices & the fall of the Berlin Wall; both of which were in no way related to anything GOP.

I've been screaming since before Reagan.

Maybe one day people will awaken to the greedy GOP?
2630 2018-08-14 18:46:45 The Space Force might be the LEAST ridiculous military escapade of late. Far less ridiculous than subjugating Iraq for oil, destabilizing Haiti, supporting dictators etc. Colonialism and war abroad are far more farcical than space hegemony which.... yes, is also ridiculous

2640 2018-08-14 18:45:33 I thought I had a handle on this whole “grown up” thing but then I realized I’m 8,000 miles/5 months past when I should have gotten an oil change

2642 2018-08-14 18:45:26 Are you going to bring back the whale oil business next? Those guys risk their lives to light our homes and businesses. We need to respect them by saving their jobs!

2644 2018-08-14 18:45:14 1.Avoid strong soaps.
-Strong soaps and detergents can strip oil from the skin. Instead,chose mild cleansers.

2.Moisturise dry skin.
-Doing this will soften the skin and pores and make you feel more refreshed. I suggest using aloe water from L’Oréal.

2663 2018-08-14 18:43:37 Whale blubber for heating oil.
2664 2018-08-14 18:43:29 Yes. That uses SF6 as the insulating medium, easier to work with than the oil in the power supply tank.

2673 2018-08-14 18:42:46 Yeah, also just got back from shopping. I was just marveling at everyone’s forebearance. The dividing it into 4 transactions And then if it still goes through that 4th time understanding when the customer says OK please go get that oil and let’s see if it will go thru

2692 2018-08-14 18:40:26 CBD Oil is good too but it's not covered under Canadian medical drug plans you have to pay for it, but it works a couple drops under the tongue and away ya go! Nabilone is covered under Provincial Senior Drug Plans..not sure about all provinces though.

You should apply at the roots of your hair, where your hair grows from and leave in 1+ hours or overnight for better results. The longer you leave it in, the more effective it will be. I put coconut oil in my hair every 1-2 weeks overnight.
2718 2018-08-14 18:37:51 You should go get your oil changed before you go, especially if it’s been a while since your last one.

2731 2018-08-14 18:36:47 She's taking Rimadyl, Gabapentin, and CBD oil. Sometimes the pain still overwhelms her, so we're going to need to re-think things. Laser, maybe. Acupuncture? Water therapy? I am SO GLAD the meds helped your girl.
2732 2018-08-14 18:36:41 Yes. You got it. But also understand the general chemistry of Int’l chemical production and boycotts don’t work because most palm oil is invisible. It’s in every cleaning product you use. Not by that name. Demand better from big brands.
2733 2018-08-14 18:36:40 -how to get soft hair hacks-
To get long,thick,soft hair massage 2tbsp of coconut oil mixed with 1tbsp of almond oil into your scalp and ends of your hair rinse with shampoo then put on conditioner and leave it on for two mins then wash it off. Repeat 2-3 times a week
2734 2018-08-14 18:36:30 Did you mean 'has started exporting oil'

2739 2018-08-14 18:36:04 i just witnessed a mom pouring eucalyptus oil on plants to prevent bugs biting kids... does anyone know this fucking song
2740 2018-08-14 18:35:57 Perfect Storm:

My honey-do list today was to clean both the fishbowl and the bathroom. 

While cleaning, the oil guy came for our boiler tune-up, telling me not to use hot water for a couple hours. 

I’m now at the doctor for my physical.  I can only imagine how bad I smell.
2741 2018-08-14 18:35:51 Deinvest from oil pipelines, get rid of monthly account fees
2742 2018-08-14 18:35:48 Same here re wasps.  I have put out traps now but will try peppermint oil!
2743 2018-08-14 18:35:34 in what way, when, did he "slam the door" on western Cdn oil Geoff? Was it when he approved a pipeline to move it?  I'm confused.
2744 2018-08-14 18:35:28 Aku sebelum acne to masak lemak aku dh simbahkan dgn tea tree oil. Kuman terpendam kot. Tp kulit aku jenis once scar susah sgt nk recover sbb tu takottt
2745 2018-08-14 18:35:27 자꾸 플텍충이 멘션담 존나 웃기네 내 튓 다 보고 있는건가 관종본능 뻐렁친다 이기야^^야 궁금한게 있는데 광복절에 매국질하면 재밋냐??
2746 2018-08-14 18:35:03 The way westminster has treated scotland recently I was actually starting to think maybe the oil was running out
2747 2018-08-14 18:34:53 My lead team gave the entire staff an oil diffuser for our classrooms...and honestly it's live changing.
2748 2018-08-14 18:34:52 Brewers with a helluva 1st inning in Chicago, in series they really need take.
2749 2018-08-14 18:34:42 "US crude oil inventories are estimated to have declined by 2.7 million bbl last week, for a second consecutive week, according to a Reuters’ poll. The poll showed that gasoline inventories are also expected to have declined by 0.8 million bbl"
2750 2018-08-14 18:34:36 All covered in baby oil...  :-)
2751 2018-08-14 18:34:33 The I Runner Pro is a slip resistant OSHA compliant safety shoe, ideal for food services, supermarkets, healthcare or other service industries. It features a slip, oil & skid resistant sole, extra depth for orthotics, a rocker sole to improve gait, seam free toe box & other
2752 2018-08-14 18:34:32 Well, we can't buy the Saudi oil from Canada now
2753 2018-08-14 18:34:32 The pizza smells so good already ahhh.. I actually hate tuna & haven't ate that in ages but on pizzas its kinda yummy. Most are made with soy oil tho so I can't eat dghe others have huge a$$ onions on them. So yeah once it's done I have to pick off all onion before I can eat it…
2754 2018-08-14 18:34:17 Fired from the @FBI in disgrace and blue-checked, to boot.  Way to go, @jack!
2755 2018-08-14 18:34:01 Not stupid. Lazy. Africans like short cuts and reaping where they did not sow. Oil fueled this lifestyle. All these your comparisons are shallow.
2756 2018-08-14 18:34:00 334
2757 2018-08-14 18:33:52 First, where are we buying this from? Oil companies. If they won’t invest in dilbit, then we can’t buy it.

Second, many people don’t care where food comes from, why would you think oil is different? Food like coffee, chocolate, avacodos, bananas...or electronic component metals
2758 2018-08-14 18:33:47 I didn't expect he'd answer and I was looking for an answer.
2759 2018-08-14 18:33:27 @SkodaIndia Answer - Replacing the oil and the oil filters #SKODAServiceExplained
2760 2018-08-14 18:33:15 the left media outlets were helping out  the CIA, the FBI & an oil company at Standing Rock. These media outlet people were infiltrators & i  think got  other infiltrators,got mercenaries & got agent provoceteurs to cause trouble  & chaos. They arent SJWs they fight SJWs. WORD!!
2761 2018-08-14 18:33:14 Essential Oil Blend
Anxiety ~ Stress?!
It’s amazing .. out of state clients who stop by again to see me..
2762 2018-08-14 18:33:02 There was a picture of the three arrows. US media goes "HURRRR ANTIFA!" A person wearing the three arrows would literally start fights or kill antifa members in Germany in the 1920s. 
This is what happens when you bring just headlines.
2763 2018-08-14 18:32:56 You pick a new place to get your oil changed LOL
2764 2018-08-14 18:32:52 Yes!!!! I have really bad anxiety!! One day I was out of control. I was shaking, I couldn’t eat and I was having a complete breakdown. Someone suggested cbd oil- I immediately went & got some. I was completely calm within minutes & could finally eat. That stuff is magical 
2765 2018-08-14 18:32:51 G.W. WAS THE SECOND WORSE potus. He brought our Country to the brink of bankruptcy. Sacrificing young men lives for oil profits & greed is a whole new level of EVIL. trump keeps everything secret, we never hear abt raids, deaths, or civilian casualties. #NoSoulNoDecency
2766 2018-08-14 18:32:50 All the CBD OIL is in 1000mg and 300mg.
2767 2018-08-14 18:32:47 Whatever the unemployment figures purport to show, this is not full employment. Such inflationary pressure as exists is due to the $ being strong v. the £ given we import oil. Not that the exchange rate with the Euro great either.
2768 2018-08-14 18:32:42 Which leads me to believe I could be correct. It was likely brought to Apple's attention after the fact. Chances are it would be the radio stuff or potentially the covers that could cause an issue. Just a guess but it would make sense.
2769 2018-08-14 18:32:30 Coal, oil... Etc. Cars are provenly capable to be fully electric and affordable now, the tech is only going to improve.
2770 2018-08-14 18:32:26 Oh please, don't put oil on fire ><
2771 2018-08-14 18:32:20 You forgot to mention @realDonaldTrump in your tweet
2772 2018-08-14 18:32:20 Which is to say, you don't use the palm oil that comes from the destructive methods we are discussing?  [Just trying to understand 'organic production']  And thank you, by the way.
2773 2018-08-14 18:32:10 my car died right when I parked at the mechanic to get an oil change so idk how to feel
2774 2018-08-14 18:32:09 This is helpful! Thank you. I'm still in that vicious cycle of relying on caffeine because of the exhaustion, but I have cut down a lot. Magnesium balm and CBD oil/balm is also doing a top job for me right now. Hope you're as pain free as can be 
2775 2018-08-14 18:32:07 Like I did an avocado, egg , olive oil mask and I’ve just washed it off 
Now I’ve got lots of fibre in my hair 
How do I get a rid of it? 
#GirlTalkZA
2776 2018-08-14 18:31:52 Gotta be an oil Barron to even think about living there, but it's the perfect location.
2777 2018-08-14 18:31:41 Here is a reminder to those with wood shops or other shops, don’t forget to oil all your blades and metal tools periodically! That goes double for those of us in coastal areas with higher humidity. Don’t let rust get its foot in the door!
2778 2018-08-14 18:31:32 That interview from Frank the snake oil salesman ought to be good for a few laughs and eye rolls. #GH
2779 2018-08-14 18:31:27 We are gradually loosing our culture and Ghanaian heritage. 
I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot instead of robbing the oil on his hair....

                 So so sad 
                        
2780 2018-08-14 18:31:23 It’s an oil that people make from an herb- you can find it at any health food store but I got mine At Faith’s naturals on South Street
2781 2018-08-14 18:31:19 #HomeSchool or have kids learn the 5 pillars of islam while 10 Commandments are banned. 

True story.
2782 2018-08-14 18:31:14 Spit'n oil Rip'n Soul! 2Strokes!
For the love of riding!
2783 2018-08-14 18:31:08 It only takes 5 minutes... when you get it right.  It's easy to throw away a single egg and a little bit of oil (or try to rescue it by adding more mustard) and do it right the second time. 
2784 2018-08-14 18:31:03 Store it upside down and all the oil will mix in
2785 2018-08-14 18:31:03 @itsgabrielleu I have adenomyosis and struggled with my fertility too. I don't know if this will work for you, but I took serrapeptase & did castor oil packs for 3 months & was finally able to get pregnant after trying for over 5 years. It's worth a shot. #adenomyosis #fertility
2786 2018-08-14 18:31:01 Conservatives were better for the environment. As I sit in my living room choking on forest fire smoke, I have no choice but to vote for what's best for my health and family. Unfortunately that's not the oil supporting Liberal party.
2787 2018-08-14 18:31:00 Long overdue an oil change
2788 2018-08-14 18:30:34 Eucalyptus is also very good mixed with lemon oil with a carrier oil
2789 2018-08-14 18:30:28 Pure oils are so expensive. Like I really paid $10 for this rosemary oil

2792 2018-08-14 18:30:22 True they didn't do a great job, and that Iranians were disappointed multiple times, but they did complete Azadegan North (#cnpc) and #Yadavaran (#Sinopec) in 2016 (with 3 year delays) = 175 kbd oil production together. Azadegan North was even finished under budget. #oott
2793 2018-08-14 18:30:20 Didn't know my contract with Honda was up No more free oil changes

2799 2018-08-14 18:29:57 - for extra smooth hands/ feet: before going to sleep use coconut oil or a body butter and make moisturise them with that. Put on gloves and socks overnight 
- massage your skin with coconut oil after shaving (IG: Threadsforgoals)

2802 2018-08-14 18:29:43 You are correct about the album. Strangely though it was there at one point.
2803 2018-08-14 18:29:42 He did the tombstone & ran fast af from those oil riggers 
2804 2018-08-14 18:29:40 If you come from oil money or make six figures a year put your hands up  it’s for a documentary   only open to men over 5”11 pls. Preferably with a beard but not necessary.
2805 2018-08-14 18:29:39 And Britain and USA to stop bombing Muslim countries in the pursuit of oil
2806 2018-08-14 18:29:35 What exactly has corbyn done wrong. He laid a wreath at a grave big deal. Maybe the world should address Palestine issue and save lives.
2807 2018-08-14 18:29:20 Very common of slaves...they dance with the people enslaving them!
2808 2018-08-14 18:29:18 Super Petrol up and we export oil... after Turkana stops blocking it we should stop it at Nairobi and use it..no more export.
2809 2018-08-14 18:29:08 Xbox is like a chainsaw always needing a an oil change to just barely maintain normal function. Or some shit But in this case it's the servers that are unplayable
2810 2018-08-14 18:29:06 It is where the illness starts over there in the north east keep your damn oil we got the sun and it's free!!
2811 2018-08-14 18:28:55 We were mostly farmers and sheep herders in the desert under the torching sun before oil .. I think it is in our blood to go back to that if necessary .. ofcourse we praise Allah for our blessings and hope their absence won't be a sign of his anger upon us
2812 2018-08-14 18:28:52 Major oil spill Routes 28/105 traffic is rerouted.

Traffic delays.
2813 2018-08-14 18:28:46 I'm guessing oil and vinegar is involved though?
2814 2018-08-14 18:28:35 Big Oil would never lie to us.

2817 2018-08-14 18:28:26 Comes down to whether or not Apple has the rights. If I remember correctly, Incesticide is made up of outtakes, covers, demos, radio recordings and some B-sides and while it was released on the same label, there could be secondary rights on that content Apple doesn't have.
2818 2018-08-14 18:28:22 India may cut back on #oil. If it can continue the strategic Chabahar port development.
2819 2018-08-14 18:28:18 จริง. คิดแล้วอยากจะ cry cry cry
2820 2018-08-14 18:28:16 Kenya is a country with surprises everyday. Globally oil prices are going down, we are infact mining our own black gold but the refined petroleum prices keep on increasing. Someone should do a dissertation on this.
2821 2018-08-14 18:28:09 September oil changes are posted and emails will be sent out tomorrow. Be sure to reserve your oil change early. Les Changement d'huile pour septembre sont sorti, reserver tot.
2822 2018-08-14 18:28:05 Trust me your engine will last longer than you expect with excellent performance. Master Oil issa goal..
2823 2018-08-14 18:28:04 2. carbon taxes are perceived as less volatile than other factors (crude oil prices) that increase gasoline prices, and so people are more willing to make investments that reduce consumption, like investing in an energy efficient car.
2824 2018-08-14 18:28:00 Not interested in an egg yolk, oil, and vinegar sandwich.
2825 2018-08-14 18:27:36 Your freedoms were never in jeopardy in your lifetime. The military went across the world to secure oil and to impose on international government. You’re a fool.
2826 2018-08-14 18:27:35 Nice
2827 2018-08-14 18:27:33 I drew an oil pastel picture of Marilyn Manson when I was in 7th grade. I hate myself
2828 2018-08-14 18:27:18 This has been a concern of mine for years. While I avoid palm oil in foods/beauty products, I’ve also learned a lot from @orangutans regarding the intersection of sustainability harvest & impacts on the local ecosystem & economy.
2829 2018-08-14 18:27:07 Just took the most relaxing tea tree oil + lavender + epsom salt bath. #iamagoddess #staycation #treatyoself
2830 2018-08-14 18:27:00 You won’t believe the oil and gas production coming out of the Permian Basin!
2831 2018-08-14 18:26:51 CBD oil?? It’s helped with my anxiety sooooooo much.
2832 2018-08-14 18:26:49 Ahh that must explain why he buys oil from and sells billions of dollars of weapons to a Sunni nation.
You have no idea what you are talking about.
Have a great day.
2833 2018-08-14 18:26:28 I’m not fuckin’ flying first class: just oil and eggs, like the Pilgrims used to
2834 2018-08-14 18:26:16 At 83, those of us who had to go fight your oil money profiteering venture are losing hope we will get to see your corpse dangling from the gallows in The Hague.

2837 2018-08-14 18:25:50 Aioli was originally olive oil emulsified with garlic (not necessarily egg involved, which is true of traditional mayo), but modern restaurants basically make mayo and add garlic or other spices and call it aioli 
2838 2018-08-14 18:25:50 casting out all sickness and disease they shall lay hands on the sick @SirOzFox and they will recover in the authority victorious name of Jesus ..in Agreement Amen. @annielobert James 5:14 calls to anoint the sick with oil, and the prayer of faith shall save them.
2839 2018-08-14 18:25:19 She was popular strictly because she increased taxes on oil companies and royalty payments to residents, which is the kind of socialism that she railed against.

After people realized what an idiot she was, he approval rating fell more than 40 points within six months.
2840 2018-08-14 18:25:18 Without solid evidence this is nothing more than propaganda and you are nothing more than a snake oil salesman
2841 2018-08-14 18:25:11 Yes my whole body hurts but that's what the medical marijuana is for and I use cannabis oil and I eat hemp seeds so that helps
2842 2018-08-14 18:25:05 finally
2843 2018-08-14 18:24:49 Political theme - they have to show people that they are doing something so to "hurt" Americans. But significant part of oil export settles in $. While you can dump UST overnight it is hard to change how oil companies sell oil
2844 2018-08-14 18:24:40 Whooa ok that is a no no for just wax or oil but def when it comes to carts
2845 2018-08-14 18:24:37 Slide into my DM n table your application

2851 2018-08-14 18:24:10 OK, I see. You ask if sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. Fair enough. Oil and milk are more like apples and oranges than geese and ganders. Oh- and I did not say I don't support SM for oil- I am genuinely interested in your reasoning.
2852 2018-08-14 18:24:05 Hope and change in whaling for whale oil for lamps at night!

2854 2018-08-14 18:23:50 CBD oil is usually okay to mix with pretty much anything. But still, whoops! 

It can affect your bodies ability to metabolize things as quickly (CYP450) as normal, but apparently so does grapefruit. CBD can also make some drugs MORE effective. 
2855 2018-08-14 18:23:50 that's xxx why he has Olive oil :/

2862 2018-08-14 18:23:01 Oh hell no.... dealership is 100 bucks just to change the oil!!!!
2863 2018-08-14 18:22:44 -I’m taking mine for an oil change Friday. I could be in the same boat. Specially since winter is coming.

2867 2018-08-14 18:22:15 Look up shell Oil and BP and who started the CIA. Guess what...same people. Same companies. Same group that owns the top 5 banks, oil companies and insurance companies in the world. The run the US military and the government. They decide most matters across the globe.
2868 2018-08-14 18:21:57 Do a simple oven roasted root vegetables. Carrots, potatoes, onions, whatever on hand. Toss in olive oil - coat with garlic powder, rosemary, black pepper, salt. In pan in oven 450 for 40 min. (Toss at the 20 min mark.) Serve with fresh parsley.

2873 2018-08-14 18:21:34 Such a tough change to make. I find that if I eat a lot of starch with my oil, I don't experience as much of The Horror. It's still an experiment every time, though.

I feel, years later, that my body learned to cope a LITTLE bit. I hope yours does, too!

2882 2018-08-14 18:21:01 @NissanUK Hi, my Nissan Qashqai 2014 had it’s full service today. Since Feb’s last service it has apparently used an entire engine full of oil- with no oil warning light at any point coming on to let me know. Surely that can’t be right???!!!

2885 2018-08-14 18:20:49 Oil isn’t going anywhere until the last drop is burned. The government makes too much tax off it for it to go anywhere. Same goes for cigarettes and alcohol, no matter what you hear to the contrary. Ca. make more off a pack of smokes than RJ Reynolds. They’re not going anywhere.
2886 2018-08-14 18:20:48 No.especially journalists like you.Petrol pumps, Euro Oil , News papers quota and many more benefits.

2888 2018-08-14 18:20:34 I purchased the car from Honda Brighton UK. It’s been regularly serviced by Honda Littlehampton (Yeomans). The car has been looked at several times by the dealership. Honda UK was involved at the time & inferred ‘it was normal’! It behaves as if there’s oil on the clutch.

2892 2018-08-14 18:20:14 The upside is explosive given it was a leveraged play at y/e 2017 with negative net current assets. However, a $20 increase in oil, large exploration prospects and reserves could make this a great turnaround story. Divi 5%. They rejected a takeover offer  a few years back. #UEN

2897 2018-08-14 18:19:51 I went get my oil changed from the same place I always do and they filled my tire up for me and vacuumed my car. I must look cute today or something cause they never did that before

2927 2018-08-14 18:16:49 Norway used the oil revenues to enact a large scale program of social change. Check out the hydro power they built; Matt would know more. Norway did the SWF, while Venezuela built lots of housing. I feel like fixed vs. financial capital is not the key difference.

FL has “medical marijuana” in pills and oil form, plus a handful of strains, but none do jack for most patients.
2956 2018-08-14 18:14:42 Exactly. Ask anyone off the street to do what any motorsport. Bumper to bumper, door handle to door handle, 3 deep, 3 wide, at speeds of 150 to 210mph  & on a 24 to 70 degrees. Hoping that those around you don't loose brakes, oil...
2957 2018-08-14 18:14:39 when Iran decided to nationalize their oil supply in 1953, the U.S. overthrew the democratically elected leader of Iran and installed the shah....Under the shah, U.S. oil companies took over half of Iran's production.

2960 2018-08-14 18:14:25 In his defence, everyone he knows has investments in tobacco, mining and oil. He probably assumed it went without saying that he would have investments in them. Presumably it’s a bit like the way the rest of us don’t feel the need to declare we buy from supermarkets. Lol
2961 2018-08-14 18:14:13 These people are unhinged. Exactly why they push the whole "it takes a village" bullshit. Most adults see them for what they are. They need to get them when they're young and impressionable.

2964 2018-08-14 18:13:50 Years ago I worked on a global lubricants brand. 56m searches a month for "How do I change my motor oil?". No branded answer or help.

2980 2018-08-14 18:12:36 It is true except barrels of oil, when demand went down prices stayed high then a few greedy countries slowed production.

2994 2018-08-14 18:11:31 The Independent (i) reports that the UK has now more reserves in euros than dollars.
This is one of the reasons the American admin wants us out. They are terrified the euro will become a world currency. We then buy oil in them and Trump can't enforce his boycotts

2999 2018-08-14 18:11:09 @GreenPan_Intl I'll be honest, I am really not liking how much i have to soak your pan before I am able to clean it.  2nd use and eggs stick like glue.  And not on one pan but 2!  Never higher than med heat, always using olive oil.  My scanpans worked much better.

3018 2018-08-14 18:09:45 U might have to adjust your expectationsI started cooking tofu. I’ve found I like it best when I press and dry it for an hour or so and then marinate it w barbecue sauce /seasoning overnight & then cook it in a frying pan in olive oil. Took 30 minutes. Has more texture -flavor
3019 2018-08-14 18:09:32 We are at basically full employment.   Interest rates, oil and inflation are all rising and there is not meaningful growth in real wages. Not sure I see this as a positive and would have hoped to see more deleveraging at this point in the cycle.

3040 2018-08-14 18:07:16 It can, as a guy who signs for $6M in Florida pays no taxes, compared to the guy in Edmonton who does. Tennessee is one of those states but they do have to pay taxes on dividends & income from investment, unlike the 7 that pay nothing. That said, players pay taxes for road games.

3043 2018-08-14 18:06:55 We need to, but we will keep using the shit untill it is against the law! And that will not happen untill we get rid if the oil companies. We are "F" ed !!!

3050 2018-08-14 18:05:56 Poor @Tyga, he was probably home applying castor oil on his new edges and here comes Nicki Minaj and Safaree dragging his name into bitchfest.
3051 2018-08-14 18:05:50 Why
Because Trump largest individual 
Owner of Rosneft oil
That’s why
3052 2018-08-14 18:05:47 Yeah there ideas are to ban trenchcoats, sell bulletproof bags. None of those keeps guns out of the wrong people. NRA “solutions” are just snake oil solutions.
3053 2018-08-14 18:05:39 Then I demand supply management for OIL.  And a tariff of 270% on foreign oil.
3054 2018-08-14 18:05:25 From my new Oil & God:
Only when China, India, Japan, EU... develop enough green energy to end oil imports that the US will abandon SaudiA/GCC. Only then that US' protection of Riyadh will wane, cash will dwindle, Wahhabi terror willl diminish, & democracy willl grow in Arab land
3055 2018-08-14 18:05:11 R those in actual paper? Or just conflated tweets? I totally agree w/ ur perplexity @Ben_C_J. To be fair, I also think a lot of the indignation is amplified by not really knowing the vast lit on exercise & mental health. The authors aren't exactly selling virgin oil 4 cancer here
3056 2018-08-14 18:05:07 Conservatives are really embracing anti-intellectualism.  Makes sense, as that’s the only way to swallow their snake oil.
3057 2018-08-14 18:05:04 Had to get my oil changed and boy that was highway robbery. It's official, I'm goona be that queer who learns to change their own oil and other car stuff...
3058 2018-08-14 18:04:57 The Saudis want to control electric car manufacturing to maintain oil prices and their living.
3059 2018-08-14 18:04:54 Found some more "oil" in "chuska".
3060 2018-08-14 18:04:50 Just finished the article. Blaming Trump for misunderstanding a “process” in this context is lunacy. You ignored Turkeys involvement with isis oil exports and now apologize for their bad behavior 
3061 2018-08-14 18:04:28 What have they done for Pakistan  they have given mega project of oil refinery to India and this year they have send a lot of Pakistani labours there are laws as well for Indian working there but not for Pakistani although Pakistan army is always their for the sake of Saudi Arab
3062 2018-08-14 18:04:28 Time to go get the oil changedddd
3063 2018-08-14 18:04:24 .@Zak_Bagans Pack your pillow and an essential oil diffuser! I use OnGuard by doTerra. This will smell wonderful and fight off any undesirable germs! #doTerra
3064 2018-08-14 18:04:12 Look, truth being, when we're about to run out of oil, the solution is already there, provided the society manipulators will allow it to be used. They can either control all human movement, or they can expand it with cheap, clean, new energy, that's been around for years!
3065 2018-08-14 18:04:06 Cats can get constipated, so hopefully the vet gives him a big dose of mineral oil to help blast it all out. Also a thorough checkover for other possible issues.

3071 2018-08-14 18:03:31 Hey @DNC & @TomPerez disappointed that you & union heads conflated oil/gas PAC donations with individual oil/gas worker donations by rolling back the rules for not accepting PAC money. Small $ donations will change the world. You just ceded moral high ground. @PodSaveAmerica
3072 2018-08-14 18:03:31 Yes, I’ve pointed this out. All if a sudden, MEK, Saudis, Israelis & tied groups In US seem really interested in Iranian national pride & oil rights over the Caspian
3073 2018-08-14 18:03:16 We eat a lot of them fresh, any leftover get frozen for use over the winter, the cherry ones are really good semi dried in a low oven and kept in oil like sun-dried
3074 2018-08-14 18:03:13 Liberals are real pieces of work. They want everything that suits them regulated such as banks, oil and gas drilling, etc., etc., but borders and immigration? Nope. #Libtards you can’t have your cake and eat it too. #ICE #BorderControl
3075 2018-08-14 18:02:54 Lilly’s name appeared in the Tory election fraud for 2015 GE, an oil executive who was on the renewable energy committee. He is a brexiter for hire. #FBPE
3076 2018-08-14 18:02:25 Fair amount to think of there. Surely it’s cheaper just to buy oil than invade a country to get it.
3077 2018-08-14 18:02:12 Dear V.Pee Osinbade,

I heard you re a pastor,  law professor and senior advocate of Nigeria.

But, never knew you are professional con artist!

Where re the oil company HQs in NigerDelta,  whither Ogoni clean-up?

2. Sunlight and meditation/prayer for 10 mins

4. Morning shake with whey, almond milk, peanut butter, greens
5. Power shower with breathing exercise
3079 2018-08-14 18:01:07 You are in a bubble then. Trump has increased sanctions on Russia, pushed Germany away from buying mostly Russian oil and natural gas, and Trump is putting massive pressure on Iran (Russian ally).
3080 2018-08-14 18:01:05 Wish I wasn’t cringeworthy for using an oil on my knees due to a strenuous training schedule 
3081 2018-08-14 18:01:02 All I'm saying is if we kept burning witches we wouldn't have to deal with essential oil moms.

3087 2018-08-14 18:00:13 Coconut oil is Good
3088 2018-08-14 17:59:45 Truth! But I am loving the fact that a lazy meal can be "healthy" simply because I cooked without oil. Justification is satisfying!

3137 2018-08-14 17:52:36 Oil change, new brakes, rotors, and tires... this car better be grateful.
3138 2018-08-14 17:52:21 A quantum computer can be made out of paper, iron, oil, and a microcontroller, and it won't burn down even in a hot environment. This "civilization" is so disgustingly wasteful it's no wonder most of you can't even tap into the quantum computer you walk daily.
3139 2018-08-14 17:52:20 매국노들 개빡치게 하네 쉬바 부끄러운줄도 모르고 광복절에 성배전쟁 외치면서 고개 떳떳하게 쳐들고 아구 잘났다 그쵸~~~???
3140 2018-08-14 17:52:19 Then why aren’t oil prices going down?
3141 2018-08-14 17:52:09 Write him a love letter and pour half a tub of baby oil in your ass. That way he'll have something to look forward to.
3142 2018-08-14 17:52:01 My dad insisted on checking my car’s oil and all other fluids before I left Pender.  Typical dad.
3143 2018-08-14 17:52:00 Lol! Where’s the lie? 

I thought as much.... M bringing my Oil perfumes to your office soon sef! He must buy 
3144 2018-08-14 17:51:59 @ the naturale girls. What hair lotion/ cream do you guys use. Also what type of oil?
3145 2018-08-14 17:51:46 Hopefully, this may open the creaky gates on the whole fake pharmaceuticals snake oil industry.
3146 2018-08-14 17:51:44 Asking for a friend ... how do you pass time when they say your oil change is going to take 2.5 hours? #OilChangeNightmares
3147 2018-08-14 17:51:21 The former has something to do with oil. No idea about the latter I’m afraid...
3148 2018-08-14 17:51:21 since 2014 oil prices have been fairly low globally yet the effect has never been felt in Kenya due to taxation smh
3149 2018-08-14 17:50:39 Thank you Sir: “Slaves” to oil? Western civilization has evolved to it’s current state because, in large part, to what oil has done and continues to enable. Is it that he doesn’t like smell or the exchange of value for $$? What?
3150 2018-08-14 17:50:31  kinda kinky ass shit is this RT @Taylornerddd: @DatzMyDJ @SoJazzy We should just beat his ass with some baby oil and a belt
3151 2018-08-14 17:50:21 Lol, true that @elonmusk is courting the eastern Oil states to take Tesla private? This is Saraki decamping in tech world
3152 2018-08-14 17:50:09 If Berkshire hates it, I love it.. oil and vinegar baby!

3154 2018-08-14 17:50:00 It comes in many forms but I really would live to hear someones argument about a natural oil being used for pain or anxiety not being straight edge
3155 2018-08-14 17:49:57 Rv pursued by the joy (oil on canvas)
3156 2018-08-14 17:49:54 Would that be a sunken oil tanker ?
3157 2018-08-14 17:49:54 I think the lady driven cars are worse.
Coz most of you all dont care for as long as its moving.. 
yall dont regularly check for anything oil, pressure or anything 
3158 2018-08-14 17:49:50 Air and Water quality - halved. National Parks - parking lots and oil derricks.
3159 2018-08-14 17:49:45 rockefeller invented oil? smrt guy.
3160 2018-08-14 17:49:44 Did 4 aromatherapy facials today and I’m high af lol literally think I got high off lavender oil.... 
Fascinating
3161 2018-08-14 17:49:23 Bizarre that with ScotRef a distinct possibility there hasn't been a clamp down on such positive statements on the long term future of oil in Scottish waters.
3162 2018-08-14 17:49:21 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
3163 2018-08-14 17:49:18 @BrianDunning I dig skepticism a lot but you say some things that are objectively wrong in your epigenetics article. That said, anyone selling something in the ways you discuss is indeed selling snake oil, which is already problematic for the public
3164 2018-08-14 17:49:11 but i dont have any olive oil
3165 2018-08-14 17:48:58 it is the british north sea and before you start moaning about oor oil in oor sea the oil fields come under The UK Continental Shelf meaning they belong to all four countries of the uk got it even dopey sturgeon knows this
3166 2018-08-14 17:48:58 every time I go in to get an oil change for my car it’s never just an oil change. I always need other things fixed 
3167 2018-08-14 17:48:56 clean it up you fools, you clean up oil spills, why should this be any different , sky is falling people at it again
3168 2018-08-14 17:48:45 Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees oil prices hitting $90 a barrel by the second quarter of 2019 (June 30) as  oil barrels are removed from the market and other supply disruption risks threaten the tightening oil market.
3169 2018-08-14 17:48:37 We should just beat his ass with some baby oil and a belt
3170 2018-08-14 17:48:36 I really wonder when things play out how long it will take them to restore production to the oil system.
3171 2018-08-14 17:48:27 I changed my pump while in line for an oil change....that’s a new one
3172 2018-08-14 17:48:25 Yeah wait till We hit a new Nadir..and then again another.
At this rate we should be hitting OIL pretty soon..
Heights of Shamelessness.
3173 2018-08-14 17:48:20 What's disappointing is that only half the #BlueJays joined in on the tour.
3174 2018-08-14 17:48:18 I think of all the "after man" post apocalyptic stories with that tripe "The Ancients knew they would fall but could not avoid it" peak oil glibal warming crap. And think we need a fascist sci fi story where they ask "Did the Weimars want to make Nations stronger?"
3175 2018-08-14 17:48:17 Billionaires who ignore climate change in exchange for profit are immoral. Oil, gas, and coal companies continuing to wreck the environment for profit are immoral. Politicians who refuse to pass legislation limiting their actions are immoral.

People who have kids aren't immoral.
3176 2018-08-14 17:48:10 I find it fascinating how Saudi Arabia has taken so many measures against Canada for criticizing the country for arresting women and civil rights activists yet the one thing they haven't stopped is selling us oil.  Hey Canada... screw them and drop them.  Stop buying their oil!!!
3177 2018-08-14 17:48:05 cishet men are out there trying to use tanning oil as lube
3178 2018-08-14 17:48:01 Isis oil?
3179 2018-08-14 17:47:56 The Tories are in a much worse mess than they were when he took over. 

I'd be surprised if he were ignoring the views of unions and activists. But he does seem to understand that policy is more of an oil tanker than a speedboat.
3180 2018-08-14 17:47:53 Only thing is, coconut oil will never be solid in Florida. It's always hotter than 76 degrees.
3181 2018-08-14 17:47:50 Bless me na Larry

3184 2018-08-14 17:47:35 Do any of my friends have an interest in marketing CBD oil? If so, please private message me. Thanks!
3185 2018-08-14 17:47:32 That could be true, but its a tough counterfactual to test. Gas prices rose rapidly in late 2000's and everyone was talking about peak oil and perpetual Mideast instability. Expectation was prices would be high forever and yet people kept shifting to SUVs.
3186 2018-08-14 17:47:12 I've discovered coconut oil makes my espresso more tolerable. And so far, I've hit my macros for everything. (I thought life without sugar was going to suck, but I'm adjusting)
3187 2018-08-14 17:47:07 I’m Furious with these Oil prices YALL PRICES TOO HIGH YALL NEED TO CUT IT @jiffylube 
3188 2018-08-14 17:47:04 It’s my fave thing to make when I get good oil
3189 2018-08-14 17:46:47 Haha. I actually thought of making a burger with crumpets out of em. Toasted crumpets with olive oil sandwiched between fish burger 
3190 2018-08-14 17:46:41 สวยๆๆๆๆๆๆ
3191 2018-08-14 17:46:37 Any thoughts/warnings about canning with this? My understanding is that oil+low acid tomatoes are a no no.
3192 2018-08-14 17:46:36 I seriously love me some cup noodles I like to add some seasame oil/seeds, garlic,ginger,green onion, gochujang AND CHEESE  man and when the noodles r gone I add rice to the broth to finish it off 
3193 2018-08-14 17:46:30 another classic...
3194 2018-08-14 17:46:28 I'm looking forward to the collapse of oil. It happened in 2016 when oil dropped to $10 a barrel... It's going to happen again and long before this pipeline is built
3195 2018-08-14 17:46:28 my skin so damn dry and oily. I put some coconut oil and that sucked it dry 
3196 2018-08-14 17:46:14 Check your Engine oil today.

3198 2018-08-14 17:45:59 Liberal, Green and NDP party policy. Make our foreign oil suppliers rich while we starve Canadians, and Rob them with carbon taxes!!!
3199 2018-08-14 17:45:57 Al Sharpton doesn't care what anybody calls him as long as you spell his name correctly.
Race pimps, snake oil salesmen all the same unnecessary vocations. 
Instead of calming a situation he purposely pours gasoline on the fire.
3200 2018-08-14 17:45:47 I'm sure you're not supporting these money-hungry environmental terrorists by driving a car, taking a bus or train while wearing oil based polyester/plastic blend clothing created in factories powered by fossil fuels. You've boycotted electricity to I hope?
3201 2018-08-14 17:45:29 LOL  TURKEY’S BFF, RUSSIA has shown evidence that Turkey was buying oil from ISIS thereby funding them. Besides the mountains of evidence that Turkey’s borders have been particularly porous for ISIS fighters. Get your facts straight. There is no secret here.
3202 2018-08-14 17:45:23 COSMOPOLITAN: Put your essential oil on their navel
3203 2018-08-14 17:45:22 I read your profile it says you’re a snake oil salesman, funny.

3205 2018-08-14 17:45:02 Yup, pretty damn impressive and they don't have anything that resembles an ugly contract on their roster. No question that can change but outside of Bonino, who was a UFA, you can't point to a deal Poile gave out and wonder what on earth was he thinking.
3206 2018-08-14 17:45:00 The reality is, for most of the comments, are by people who care about Ireland and it's people and don't want to repeat the mistakes of 10 years ago. We won't follow false prophets, or snake oil salesmen anymore...
3207 2018-08-14 17:44:55 These oil change niggas talkin shit!

3210 2018-08-14 17:44:19 Dawg idc if my car on fire  I came here for a oil change nothing else 
3211 2018-08-14 17:44:12 Handy sometimes, but yes -- absolutely unnecessary, you're correct. 

If you see it in a recipe, just substitute "lightly coat [whatever they say to spray] with oil"
3212 2018-08-14 17:44:12 We have an outside oil fired boiler and oil tank. The pump faulted on the boiler on Xmas day and leaked virtually a whole tank of oil out, it travelled under the house & under every room. All floors are concrete so environmental contractors had to excavate 4ft down in every room
3213 2018-08-14 17:44:10 This is the wrong way to handle things but..  Try some CBD oil, it helps with pain.  It doesn't have the high properties and it can be found in varities.  Salve, lotion, mouth spray, etc. 
@cbdforlife
3214 2018-08-14 17:44:07 If much rather not see super tankers docking up in the UK from half way around the world. We need oil for many years to come. The risks of a huge oil spill is made less likely from UKOG Onshore oil. Fact!
3215 2018-08-14 17:44:00 There will always be idiots buying snake oil. Or how do you think are all these shopping channels are doing their business?
3216 2018-08-14 17:43:59 Strange we should CUT red tape for the oil & gas industry that has literally killed people and polluted vast areas due to negligence...but we should create MORE red tape for average Americans trying to vote, based on absolutely no data that you've been able to produce. SO ODD.

3222 2018-08-14 17:43:06 @ZoesKitchen I love your food! But I was wondering if you have an ingredients list. I’m avoiding certain ingredients (such as corn and canola oil) and I’d like to know what’s in your food.
3223 2018-08-14 17:43:03 It's time to oil up
3224 2018-08-14 17:42:49 Hell yeah!  I mean I'm not sure why he is carrying a farm animal but I'm not really focusing on that.

3226 2018-08-14 17:42:35 Once I found out mayonnaise is just eggs and oil, I started making my own. I'm killing the industry by becoming an amateur maker, I guess.
3227 2018-08-14 17:42:17 So you think that inviting back the Shah is a good idea instead? 

I assume you know that the original Shah was put in place after the coup against Mosadegh by US and UK, to make sure those countries had access to Iranian oil? Have you forgotten about the horrors of SAVAK?
3228 2018-08-14 17:42:16 Ossining oil spill- why is prime waterfront land being used to store Waste Oil.  Yesterday a truck leaked it all over downtown costing major tax $ in cleanup and PD/FD time- the Ossining government needs to make it clear the Waste oil company is no longer welcome here #DailyVoice
3229 2018-08-14 17:42:15 dude, mayo is just neutral oil whipped with egg. Mustard has actual flavor.

3236 2018-08-14 17:41:38 Sex and all is cool but have you ever seen her while she takes her makeup off with baby oil?
3237 2018-08-14 17:41:35 Just mind-blowing that a recent piece from the #FraserInstitute on petroleum investment has #Alberta ranked 33rd and #BC 76th. Extremely disappointing and a sign that major change needs to take place. #oil

3242 2018-08-14 17:40:53 It wasn’t my choice.- it is bonkers but similar level of madness to Scotland achieving independence. Have seen the oil price. You’re relying on a dying industry and the market can go up as well as down.

3246 2018-08-14 17:40:41 Until independence, Scotland has pretty much no say on whether the Oil is all pumped out until it's gone, or at some point soon we #KeepItInTheGround ...
3247 2018-08-14 17:40:37 ...socialists rarely care about costs or consequences.  Just look at Venezuela which should be deep in cash from all the oil revenue, but squandered it away.
3248 2018-08-14 17:40:34 BTW, great job on dredging up Musk's previous oil co. commentary, including the non-sensical one conflating oil use with electricity generation.
3249 2018-08-14 17:40:27 What a way to end a decent summer. Multiple massive depressive states  forgetting to finalise financial aid until the week before bill is due  spend $400 on books for school  send car in for an oil change

Coconut oil.
3254 2018-08-14 17:40:10 that last one is cold af

3255 2018-08-14 17:40:07 Sharing funny w/@SecureWVCon - years ago, my partner's brother, supposedly an #oil #Engineering genius from England was coming to visit us in Charleston, SC. We waited at airport, he finally called saying "Where r u, I've been here for an hour!?" He flew into Charleston, WV!
3256 2018-08-14 17:39:58 I heard somewhere that the turkana oil is just a drop in the ocean
3257 2018-08-14 17:39:52 I don't remember if they're sulfate, mineral oil, or paraben free, but they use high quality botanicals and moisturize like nothing else I've found. I buy them off Amazon. I spread a dab of castor oil over my palms and smooth it over a freshly detangled section before twisting.
3258 2018-08-14 17:39:50 Someone honked at me to back out of my parking spot faster so I pulled back into my spot and checked the windshield wiper fluid level and the oil level.

3261 2018-08-14 17:39:39 Forgot to mention how enjoyable last night's Dodgers v Giants game was. Brilliantly pitched by two of the game's best starters over the past decade and entertaining as hell to boot.
3262 2018-08-14 17:39:24 My boyfriend said Jamaican castor oil smells like tsunami 
3263 2018-08-14 17:39:21 It is simple Mr Nalapat. This govt survived all through this situation because of the low oil prices.They were indeed lucky all this time. We in the industry knew it all the time the day crude prices start firming up they will start facing the heat.

3268 2018-08-14 17:38:46 2/2 imho, Saudi Arabia is a medieval dictatorship that treats women horrendously. No one dares to say anything because, well, oil reserves and weapon sales, and so I was pleasantly surprised to hear our foreign minister (@cafreeland) actually call them out on it 
3269 2018-08-14 17:38:35 I just remembered how we used to eat boiled yam and palm oil, or vegetable oil, fried with onions, and it was so good. We've come far
3270 2018-08-14 17:38:31 If you’re not taking Black Seed Oil everyday idk what you’re doing but it cures everything but death. I’m not joking.
3271 2018-08-14 17:38:27 Omg using coconut oil to take off fake tan is life changing!! not only does it melt it off without scrubbing at your skin until it’s red raw, it leaves you soft and moisturised af thank you Phoebe Benson

3275 2018-08-14 17:37:59 That is too much information. And besides, considering Mayo is fat (egg yolk) suspended in fat (oil) I can't see how this could possibly be considered "insufficient lube". But that's just my 2 cents.
3276 2018-08-14 17:37:58 I can see why @swankybb say St, George’s Jouvert was too clean. She well oil down
3277 2018-08-14 17:37:58 Been here since 940 FOR A DAMN OIL CHANGE why am I still here

3284 2018-08-14 17:37:28 Black seed oil. I take a teaspoon every morning and night and I put it on my face every morning and night. Healed my cystic acne and acne scars in 4 days.
3285 2018-08-14 17:37:23 I have never seen a tree with so many benefits like the Coconut tree.
Imagine getting all these from one single tree:
1. Timber 
2. Makuti for roofing.
3. Coconut fruit.
4. Coconut juice for cooking
5. Coconut oil
6. Mnazi (This is the most important)
3286 2018-08-14 17:37:21 Several weeks ago you said you talked to the Saudis and they will increase oil production by 2 million barrels.  Just read that they are cutting oil production. Please explain!!!
3287 2018-08-14 17:37:20 By surrendering our #energy independence and locking us in to a certain future of #oil and #gas imports, Ireland's reputation as a geopolitically stable destination for foreign direct investment would be at risk
3288 2018-08-14 17:37:19 Depending on the spray you get, it is just normal oil (just dispensed differently). It's really for when the oil/butter isn't part of the recipe, but to make sure your food doesn't stick. But yes, lightly oiling/buttering whatever it says to spray usually works just fine, haha.
3289 2018-08-14 17:37:09 Safaree was mixing coconut oil and minding his business, now this
3290 2018-08-14 17:37:05 #NonOpioidMoms #sweepstakes things like willow bark tea, peppermint oil, etc. Morphine however has been around since the civil war
3291 2018-08-14 17:37:02 I'm looking up Loma now. I've never heard of that. Sulfate, mineral oil, paraben free you think? And how do you with castor oil? I have it but its soooooo thick.
3292 2018-08-14 17:37:00 @OMAROSA ...I need some cannabis oil!  Shit done got real af!
3293 2018-08-14 17:36:50 Is it because the Newfoundland oil has already been sold?  Actually curious.
3294 2018-08-14 17:36:46 #SaudiArabia's investment in $TESLA for around 2Bn $ is less than 3 days of its income from selling oil. That's to put into perspective the size of TESLA to the dominance of oil industry. Now we can imagine how strong companies will lobby for oil.
3295 2018-08-14 17:36:46 lol no dude mossadeq succeeded an asassainated prime Minister in 1950. he nationalizes the oil, the british embargo and the shah flees the country until the british coup in 1953. the shah allied with the nazis, he lost power when the soviets took over in 1941. suck less at this
3296 2018-08-14 17:36:42 It's a crime against etymology that castor oil didn't come from beavers.

I give you information about electricals transformer at meerut.
Max transformers installation is very poor and not follow Indian standard (IS).
And no any protection by  overload,Oil temperature, earth fault relay etc.and should any elect accident any time
3298 2018-08-14 17:36:30 We may need to get you off the creeper and into the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant, Heather!  But I'm sure you'd miss the oil dripping on your face.
3299 2018-08-14 17:36:15 15.08.2018_Log_002: Thinking and feeling can never be oil and water. You've said too many times that you don't want to think anymore, so you search for something to feel. And you feel happy, and it happened to you too fast, so other feelings creep on you, too. Stop thinking.
3300 2018-08-14 17:36:11 I was thinking they'd be in trouble in 2020 with 4 UFA defenseman, but the only one of consequence will be a 30 year old Josi. The other 3 are Hamhuis, Weber and Irwin.
3301 2018-08-14 17:35:59 Just so you all know, holding grudges is nothing but the stoppage of energy.  You can not grow with a grudge on your heart. That grudge will arrest your development. A car with no oil will seize the heck up, I don't care how much gas is it has.~Quinton Morgan ~

3303 2018-08-14 17:35:12 Here’s a crazy idea. Instead of calling them out on Twitter, let’s just stop buying their oil.

I am beginning to think that Canada should build a second pipeline and keep them both to operate as a country. For national security purposes.
3304 2018-08-14 17:35:01 Hi!!! You will need a good non-sulfate shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner and essential oils like Castor Oil.

3308 2018-08-14 17:34:21 Starting to look from some stuff on my feed that today is one of those days to put on some oil and let a few things just slide.

3316 2018-08-14 17:33:51 Found myself in Tesco today buying bio oil so that my SHIT drunken henna tattoo of a Liverpool badge that is spelt 'liver' doesn't scar up only to realise it's £20 a bastard bottle so I suppose I could change the team I support. I've had better Tuesdays.

3319 2018-08-14 17:33:41 I need a lifetime supply of Purpul oil! My word!! My hair is in love with this stuff. I had the driest scalp ever. It even scabbed. I was convinced I have a scalp condition and needed to see a dermatologist at some point.  But now we’re healthy and growing strong! 
3320 2018-08-14 17:33:38 Those three oil companies have about 100k charging stations—not inconsequential. But fair criticism
3321 2018-08-14 17:33:33 it truly sucks bc nutella is fantastic but the palm oil industry is horrible
3322 2018-08-14 17:33:30 You want to make a stand for the environment? Stand with industrial Hemp. It is the only resource that will rival BIG OIL. Who's high on what here. Watch There Will Be Blood. Industrial Hemp can produce the same product petroleum does and won't damage our lands. Love your earth.

3328 2018-08-14 17:33:05 Whatever the slide has happened is due to pure external factors which @narendramodi Ji could not control.

China-USA trade war
US’s Iran sanctions
Oil prices heating
Turkey’s economy etc
Global economic revival halted etc

None of the STRUCTURAL factors exist today.

3329 2018-08-14 17:33:04 no way noway is totally gonna get rid of carbon emissions after they *checks notes* extract all the oil under the ocean, sell it to the 3rd world, and voluntarily return to a 15th century standard of living.
3330 2018-08-14 17:33:02 I used to only have a very basic face wash and a moisturizer and I would forget to wash my face all the time, but then I got a nice toner and fancy face oil and sulfur mask for acne so now I feel like I'm doing Fun Science to my face and I remember to actually use it lol

3337 2018-08-14 17:32:06 What kind of oil would you recommend?
3338 2018-08-14 17:32:05 No I cooked the chicken in wine then I put a little bit of olive oil in a bowl with wine and brushed that onto the croissant before I cooked it 
3339 2018-08-14 17:31:51 Does he not realize that we subsidize oil companies?

3342 2018-08-14 17:31:43 2/3 Similar to Standard Oil 100 years ago, one could argue that they form a defacto monopoly even if they don’t control 100% of the sport in the US. They own so much of the total system that there effectively can be no competition. Not to mention their influence in USSF.
3343 2018-08-14 17:31:41 You need to stop doing that. That's why your hair is breaking. Wash it like you do and dry out with an old t-shirt and twist it or put it on Bantu knots with an essential oil like coconut oil or any moisturizer so it doesn't shrink. The heat is breaking your hair
3344 2018-08-14 17:31:34 Check back with me in a month, but I LOVE oil cleansing. My skin is on its way to its prime.

3356 2018-08-14 17:30:39 French aioli, which is what most aiolis now follow, uses egg; it's essentially a garlic-flavored mayonnaise. But Catalan aioli traditionally uses only garlic and olive oil. Catalan aioli is allowed; most aioli, no.

3385 2018-08-14 17:27:16 UK wouldn't rely on Scotland for O&G. Largest onshore oil in England, largest offshore gas in English waters. rUK also fracking with 94% of UK reserves so NS O&G not crucial to economy or business in rUK
3386 2018-08-14 17:27:15 What if, -1 million bpd of global oil supply choked off in early November boost oil prices. Then Saudi claims they can increase production, but they can't meet the numbers. Venezuela/Iran can't add any. Where does price go then, Lower? No, 30% higher by December. $91-$93
3387 2018-08-14 17:27:13 We just call it taxes or sometime we just realize that if everyone chip in a bit everything’s is so much cheaper for all
But in Norway I must admit they have a state owned fund because of taxes from their profitable oil industry that is so big that if it shut down every Norwegian

3408 2018-08-14 17:23:56 Light oil with basil and Parmesan is nice
3409 2018-08-14 17:23:55 Hi Richard, can't make tonight. I'll be with you is spirit. I'll try and catch up on the morning.  Keep up the great work. #IndieHour
3410 2018-08-14 17:23:53 Bulletproof coffee with Thc infused coconut oil, cinnamon and agave nectar 
3411 2018-08-14 17:23:50 Good to read that. Tuesday is going well. Day 2 of leave. Spent most of it at the gym then playing Fallout4. Listening to Hunger by Andy Smillie. Proper rage fuelled! Do some oil washes later tonight.
3412 2018-08-14 17:23:48 Anyone use Medical Marijuana/CBD oil? I've decided to go the medical pot route because numerous meds are not making a dent in my chronic nerve & back pain. I'm making some calls this afternoon!
3413 2018-08-14 17:23:47 So I did somebody’s hair the other day (crochet). She came, I did the cornrows, use my own oil on her head, she ran out of hair so I drove her to go get some more hair and we came back and finished the hair.
3414 2018-08-14 17:23:43 Clearly, I must atone (quickly too, I can't keep getting covered in chain oil)
3415 2018-08-14 17:23:34 Oh the last time I looked Um buses run on Diesel Oil ...Unless I'm missing something.
3416 2018-08-14 17:23:27 Getting my oil changed and didn’t know how to open the hood of my car and then had to run back to my car to get the Starbucks coffee that I left in it. So basically eyes are probably rolling at Jiffy Lube today.
3417 2018-08-14 17:23:22 But are you not in the skin care industry, and therefore a beneficiary of palm oil?
3418 2018-08-14 17:23:22 That’s really awesome information to learn! I have always seen contrasting information on coconut oil use for moisturizing. What oils do you recommend instead?
3419 2018-08-14 17:23:15 Oil money cya done.
3420 2018-08-14 17:23:13 My worry is that whatever replaces palm oil will lead to the same thing?
3421 2018-08-14 17:23:10 And if the Saudis happen to be bagholders, he and the believers will make the story "the Saudis (the biggest of big oil) pushed me out in order to kill the electric car".
3422 2018-08-14 17:23:05 A lot of imbeciles posting today who yet again try to link all terrorist attacks to the UK leadership. Stupidity, ignorance, peace, and a corbynite magic money tree... What a perfect world.
3423 2018-08-14 17:22:59 So CHS (Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome) may in fact actually be Neem Oil Poisoning after a recent study on CHS. 

Neem oil is a natural pesticide being used in organic farming industry and is fairly safe, except for when it comes to cannabis, due to the way in which cannabis grows
3424 2018-08-14 17:22:55 I was playing Pokémon go while getting my oil changed and the guys there are like “You play too?” Lmfao 
3425 2018-08-14 17:22:51 I need a good tanning oil help meeee
3426 2018-08-14 17:22:49 @PettyTrebek Go back to Canada you snake oil salesgirl

3428 2018-08-14 17:22:40 Basically cooking oil in an aerosol can. Americans are lazy, but its easier (or at least less messy maybe?) to do a very light coat so stuff doesn't stick
3429 2018-08-14 17:22:36 In the burden of knowledge @Blakkrasta I jxt pray  Jah Bless me with oil too,not a coconut Oil or cooking oil but real Oil like that of Folorunso Alakija @zylofon1021fm but still we can't go with it when death comes. #TaxiDriverShow
3430 2018-08-14 17:22:34 How about the EM narrative? would that spur a pause? oil is now lower and should stabilize. also, wasn't PCE more important than CPI? or is that a yellen thing only

3437 2018-08-14 17:21:40 Am I going to get an oil change or art supplies? Stay tuned on the next dragon ball z
3438 2018-08-14 17:21:39 People rotate their tires and change their oil more often than I think about changing my profile pic. Most likely, you will pay off your mortgage and student loan before I get around to it.
3439 2018-08-14 17:21:24 the lift in my building smells like coconut oil
3440 2018-08-14 17:21:18 Yeah well maybe if they stop all the #geoengineering and spraying of the skies it would return to regular rainfall! Cali is bombarded with aerosol spraying almost daily! Water is the new oil. Weather derivatives on Wall Street.. #blindeye
3441 2018-08-14 17:21:09 Let's be honest, all this comes from a deep rooted desire and hunger for oil. It goes back decades... There's no simple fix anymore.
3442 2018-08-14 17:20:47 Seems like Apple and Tesla are more suited than an oil dominated, poor human relationship country
3443 2018-08-14 17:20:36 Please tell me how heavily "subsidized" Canadian Oil and Gas is, as I read this article about Trudeau's nanny getting a pay raise.
3444 2018-08-14 17:20:36 @VinnieTortorich hey I heard you say on the podcast you spent a day with nothing but olive oil as fuel - does that mean you drink it like a shot?
Keep up the great work thanks
3445 2018-08-14 17:20:35 Maybe some wealthy oil execs can peer pressure each other to jump off a cliff

3447 2018-08-14 17:20:16 A rather bearish reversal in oil today (though we'll see how the week looks). And gold is back below $1,200 again. What's the common thread? King Dollar refuses to lay down.

3450 2018-08-14 17:19:37 Your "evidence" is a quote from Dan Haley, the president and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association? You think he's an unbiased source?

3455 2018-08-14 17:18:47 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.
3456 2018-08-14 17:18:41 The military life sucks thing, that's gonna depend on who ya talk to, but the oil wars thing is absolutely correct, left or right lol.

3465 2018-08-14 17:17:49 If the world consumes 95 Million BBL per day.
1 Million comes offline Nov 3.
-1/95 is -1.05% Supply.

Remember 2014? +1.5% surplus supply made oil price fall to $26 (-70%)
So what do you think -1% does to swing oil price higher? +25% +33% ? @TulliiLLC

3483 2018-08-14 17:15:49 Hi Michael. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
3484 2018-08-14 17:15:48 why are oil changes and tire rotations so expensive ???
3485 2018-08-14 17:15:42 Hi! Is the oil still available?

3487 2018-08-14 17:15:35 Use olive oil to soften and smoothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

3489 2018-08-14 17:15:29 Oh yeah, supporting equal rights, protecting the environment from big business equates to being power hungry.  Not pork barreling, election fraud, selling out to the oil, pharmaceutical, and weapons industries like the GOP does.  Brainwashed much?

3492 2018-08-14 17:15:19 But you also need to take into account the lease condensate, NGLs and other inputs that are not crude oil. I think it was 17.9mbpd if you look at gross inputs. That is why EIA said 18mbpd

At least we can compete at Europa level.

3548 2018-08-14 17:09:55 Why, oh why are you using crude oil prices in this announcement? You are just causing confusion and inviting unwarranted ignorant criticism!
Kenya does Not import crude an you know that.
3549 2018-08-14 17:09:53 How about resigning from the service and looking for a cleaner job in oil company if you feel so underpaid? Nonsense!  Not like you’re conscripted against your will. I bet you probably lobbied, bribed your way to the job, or favored against more qualified candidates by connection
3550 2018-08-14 17:09:42 I've read the whole lot.  Yes I am one of those weird people who actually buys Daily Mail in print every day.  And no, I'm not Very Angry From Tunbridge wells.  I'm very Angry from Aberdeen.  Well I have got a right.  We still have North Sea Oil and do very well indeed here.

3556 2018-08-14 17:08:55 I grew up with the frugal gourmet. Hot pan, cold oil, food won’t stick!
3557 2018-08-14 17:08:51 bcoz when the crude oil price was high govt provided subsidiary on it so it crated the fiscal deficit...n now when the price is low the govt is recovering the amount spent in subsidiary.....

3567 2018-08-14 17:08:08 @derekobrienmp you of all should know that currencies take a hit when there is crisis elsewhere (turkey and trade wars). Unless YOU make oil and manufacture natural resources for India somehow. #NotoTMC.
3568 2018-08-14 17:08:05 @thegiveandget @cocojamtravels @ButterRiceDDS I think it's probably oil from dressing? I don't think I eat much oils usually. I was thinking maybe those Asian ginger dressings might be better? My skin's MUCH better now, few days out. For weeks it was just pimples + broken skin.
3569 2018-08-14 17:08:05 my rig needs a oil change
3570 2018-08-14 17:08:00 Many, many countries do.  If they can't run current account surpluses, they try to acquire the foreign currency by borrowing it.  The difficulty comes from needing to buy something in a foreign currency (e.g., oil) but also have current account deficit.
3571 2018-08-14 17:07:47 My dog is 15+, suffers from 2 past bouts of canine vesibular disease attacks 4 years ago, but fully recovered with use of Valeria oil, is now deaf, pees constantly anywhere in house without warning, and has mylopathy now. Quality of her life and ours at stake. Now what?
3572 2018-08-14 17:07:40 Are you blind? Cartels took over long time along. Stop being myopic in case you are not blind or ignorant on international crude oil prices trend.
3573 2018-08-14 17:07:37 I'm salty because I live by the sea, not some dirt patch full of oil

3576 2018-08-14 17:07:30 I've just perfected a new combo of vegetarian ramen, olive oil, and sriracha, and I now have a perfect go-to 80-cent meal, so I guess you can say I'm finally a real adult.
3577 2018-08-14 17:07:20 Unfortunately Frankenstein machines will be part of the landscape until we fully embrace #EV efficiency and abolish oil slavery with its unavoidable pollution of air, land and water.
3578 2018-08-14 17:07:10 difficult to do since so many products have palm oil in them . . . but vegans are used to reading ingredient labels!
3579 2018-08-14 17:07:08 Iran Sanctions won't help you ultra bulls if the #DXY keeps going sky high, and if demand is mediocre.

3583 2018-08-14 17:06:26 That makes sense. But there is another factor that comes into play resulting in the consumption of oil from the previous month. I have heard about it somewhere.

3586 2018-08-14 17:06:19 @beautypie at least one of your products has palm oil in it. Where do you source this from and what steps do you take to ensure it’s sustainable  and ethical? Thanks
3587 2018-08-14 17:06:10 It’s an abomination.
3588 2018-08-14 17:06:07 Nothing has happened? Only thing keeping u safe is the oil

3600 2018-08-14 17:04:00 @realDonaldTrump  Our gas prices need some serious work!  The oil companies are stealing our hard-earned money with these outrageous prices.

3606 2018-08-14 17:03:47 There's also one consistent theme: none of them has ever had any experience with it.

Their favorite examples are cherry picked - Norway and the Netherlands were both in a downward spiral when they both struck offshore oil and gas in the 70s.

3611 2018-08-14 17:03:35 He wants to bail out coal. The amount of power and  money that our government fixes to oil and conveniently oil uses to buy our government  who the hell could compete?  That isn’t a fair market.
3612 2018-08-14 17:03:31 Ugh. My country is a complete embarrassment.

The blind-faith idiots can't accept that their Dear Leader is just a snake oil salesman so they instead believe an anonymous guy from the Internet's most notorious site of hoaxes that says he's a super-hero pedophilia crime-fighter.

3635 2018-08-14 17:00:44 @DeptofDefense We also must look at those countries (like the U.S.) that are too dependent on oil...so resources like oil and lithium should be mentioned in the report.  They are valuable and countries are obviously willing to fight for them.
3636 2018-08-14 17:00:42 License the shit out of that and it'll be worth a lot more than oil :)

3644 2018-08-14 17:00:16 Potstocks were the only thing keeping the TSX alive and they have come unglued. Oil and Mining sector has been destroyed a long time ago. That now leaves one industry left holding this market together and that's financials. Another sector on the verge of disaster.
3645 2018-08-14 17:00:12 There is an enormous disconnect between the oil market and the E and P valuations in Canada. Don't know what will shake the market out of it's slumber. PM's are asleep at the wheel, no idea what the market is thinking.

3665 2018-08-14 16:58:08 Some things can't be under control of GOI, particularly high exchange value of foreign currency due to fuel prices. Two costliest items crude oil and weapons r unavoidable main imports. In spite of this fact almost all economic indicators reveal sound economic position.
3666 2018-08-14 16:58:01 Looking at their cap, there would be no reason for them to move PK at all. Plenty of room for years to come and will gain extra wiggle room when Rinne comes off the books next summer.

3669 2018-08-14 16:57:53 you can get it already mixed at fuel stations but i think it's a bit expensive (2€/L) or you can get your own oil and mix yourself tho i have no idea how much you save doing that
3670 2018-08-14 16:57:48 I love to make an olive oil cake when I feel rich and can use it up! LOL.
3671 2018-08-14 16:57:46 tho most 50cc have 2 stoke engines which consume oil together with fuel (some you need to add it directly to the fuel, others have a different reservoir)
v
3672 2018-08-14 16:57:41 But it’s sooo much more effective. Of course, if one plans to polish one’s bonafides for an (ill-advised) run for the Dem nomination in 2020, then “suing big oil” seems like you’re taking on a liberal cause.
Oh, and ferries are the worst of all public transit re: pollution

3676 2018-08-14 16:57:24 Saudi oil has made them best friends with the United States since wwii. The closest relationship with the monarchy was the bush/Cheney administration. PBS frontline has had some great documentaries on the subject. Very vey sad...money
3677 2018-08-14 16:57:21 Omg noooo. When it's down to its last you literally have to cut it off and start over. No amount of oil treatments can fix that lol

3684 2018-08-14 16:56:16 So my brother in law has a Russian wife. When she first came to the states, I was BBQing and she want to help cook.

She asked me for some OIL, and I handed her some olive oil. She shook her head no, looked around and grabbed a jar of mayo out of the fridge and said “This Oil”
3685 2018-08-14 16:56:10 The satisfaction from changing your own oil 
3686 2018-08-14 16:56:07 Yes. For me the solution was not to try to make a poor, outdated dirty product a little bit cleaner with shipowners meeting the cost. Rather it was an ideal opportunity to force oil majors to create a workable spec. meeting the needs of the future.

3690 2018-08-14 16:55:50 I oven-dried them for hours, with a little seasoning, then into a sterilised jar with herbs and lashings of olive oil. Some sites say this should be good for six months but I won't be risking that first time - maybe try them in September.
3691 2018-08-14 16:55:44 Putin won’t let traitor tRump buy Canadian oil when Russia will sell to USA for more! Who’s in charge anyway...
3692 2018-08-14 16:55:38 Spray it very (very!) lightly at the roots. muss it up a bit with fingers. The stuff that absorbed oil stays (volumizing and eliminating appearance of greasy hair), the rest is brushed or shaken out. Shouldn't be a lot to shake out, though, if you use the minimum amount.

I mixed castor oil and olive oil(food grade) in a spray bottle and did Bantu knots while it was damp and slept.

Woke up it was straight but wavy. sprayed again and tied it into a bun

3699 2018-08-14 16:54:52 I don't need to counter a claim like "He'll gut the Oil and Gas industry" with facts because it is prima facie idiocy. We've had a liberal governor for a while now & the industry is doing just fine.

You "illustrated" no "facts". You made baseless assertions.

3700 2018-08-14 16:54:41 Most people definitely think they’re well intentioned. The oil fields belonging to the people would’ve been great...if that was actually what had happened. Greater good (to me) is helping people who need it. You never know when you’ll be one of them

3703 2018-08-14 16:54:25 Totally. Also if your 11-year-old doesn't understand the difference between drilling for oil in a wildlife sanctuary and not doing that, maybe you need to switch schools just sayin'
3704 2018-08-14 16:54:24 I used to think my hands were creepy and witchy. After discovering coconut oil, I now think my hands look more like those of a benevolent sorceress.
3705 2018-08-14 16:54:23 I just dont get it...all over the world oil prices per barrel are decreasing..so why is the kenyan fuel increasing???...how is it special from the ones used all across the world? ERC is looting from Kenyans!!!!

3708 2018-08-14 16:54:17 It's a disaster in the United States! This country used to be rich in oil, but now it can only rely on selling gold to pay its debts. (this is a Chinese website criticizing the headlines in the US).
3709 2018-08-14 16:53:52 Never trust a Turk, what are the conditions for the water supply? Remaining of Turkish troops on #Iraqi soil? Oil for cheap from #Kirkuk?
3710 2018-08-14 16:53:52 Autumn begins today! If this is your favorite season, comment a pumpkin emoji and buy Cinnamon Bark essential oil!
3711 2018-08-14 16:53:46 And look at Norway, with its all-out communism socialising its oil/gas. God help them, if only they'd given it away to private interests like FF did for us.

We were sold some snake oil, by a crafty one, let me tell you! #savethecrew
3713 2018-08-14 16:53:20 I had an oil change and tire rotation scheduled. When I showed up, I asked if he could check my brakes. I return to pick it up. He said we had to put new brakes on. I’m really busy so I’ll text you the cost & you can pay whenever. I’m so thankful for him!!

3718 2018-08-14 16:52:21 How do you define greater good? Many were thrilled when Venezuela declared the oil fields belonged to the people (easiest example sorry for using this exhausted instance). That was for the greater good, right? Perhaps *many* you disagree with think they are well intentioned?
3719 2018-08-14 16:52:06 I forgot coconut oil is a nice substitute when I don’t have any Shea butter mix
3720 2018-08-14 16:52:02 I pull up to Valvoline to get an oil change. An employee comes up & asks how he can help. He asks if I know which type of oil I need. I say idk so he goes “dO yOu WaNnA cAlL yOuR hUsBaNd To SeE wHaT kInD yOu NeEd?”

Bruh, I have a mechanic, I’ll call him. 
3721 2018-08-14 16:51:49 Mechanics always trying to tell other shit that’s wrong with your car... I’m not trying to hear all that, finish my oil change

3725 2018-08-14 16:51:17 I’m never buying Filippo Berio olive oil ever again. Every time I open the cupboard that damn song gets stuck in my head
3726 2018-08-14 16:51:09 そういうことだったんですねｗそれは、失礼しましたｗ
3727 2018-08-14 16:50:54 I almost washed my car this morning and then I remembered they do it when I get an oil change. #winning #lazylife
3728 2018-08-14 16:50:33 Yeah, but the suspension for the oil and meal is only for 6 months as well, so after bean tax reach 23%, both would continue to decline?

Writing is a bit like cooking& I'd say 1 of my strengths is finding where it needs more character goat cheese or less angsty truffle oil. Does that make sense?

Castor oil is the #1 most helpful way to grow your eyelashes It can make your eyelashes ticker, stronger and make them grow faster.

To avoid getting a  mess in your eyes, apply Castor oil with a brush to your lashes and eyebrows when you go to bed.
3736 2018-08-14 16:49:42 Yes and asked for it to be changed I was at a oil change place, only customer there.

3738 2018-08-14 16:49:26 @Tank_Memes I remember that video where “even if they built more tanks they didn’t have the manpower and oil.
And then that vid on Italy’s lack of industry.
Did Germany ever send their modern tanks and weapons to Italy to use? Might have changed something (especially in Greece.)

3758 2018-08-14 16:47:28 Had an art teacher encourage me to paint what I wanted. I finished blocking out my favorite dragon in oil canvas (middle school), he embarrassed me in front of everyone, said it was stupid. I threw white paint on it like a new canvas and said, "K, what else do you want me to do?"
3759 2018-08-14 16:47:21 I’m so stupid that I looked at a tanning “oil” bottle to see if it was oil free 
3760 2018-08-14 16:47:10 Airport dream. Apparently if you want to take a ps4 on your flight, you have to hand over the gallon jugs of oil they use...?
3761 2018-08-14 16:47:03 He sucked. It was a two-dimensional character put in there as a sop to cartoon-like characters for children. And he was useless.
3762 2018-08-14 16:47:02 God damn. That DXY move!!!! Oil's true fall can't be too far behind. I really hope we get 70+ again. Would be an easy short, possibly 10+ dollar move down once it begins.
3763 2018-08-14 16:47:01 @SubaruofPlano Went to Subaru of Plano for an oil change. It falls under my warranty. After being told I need a new air filter and also, unfortunately, a new tire because there was a nail and it wasn't patchable.  They said they could order the tire. $186. I walked out

3820 2018-08-14 16:41:08 Well if you have and I missed my apologies, but you do or have come of a little shady from time to time.  Not that you care as your out there living your best life hunting oil tycoons and Jimbo
3821 2018-08-14 16:40:54 I already know this nigga gon ask me again about my wipers & I only got oil change money rn. Gwan nuh
3822 2018-08-14 16:40:52 The lying machine was in the shop getting a "high mileage" oil change.
3823 2018-08-14 16:40:46 I had similar issues. Went to corn tortillas as a starch/food carrier. I’ve been able to transition to flour tortillas w/o issue. But I also cut out alcohol, cooking in oil, sugar...
3824 2018-08-14 16:40:40 I do not feel comfortable about the idea, that Saudia Arabia as a big player in oil business might reach  a strong influence on Tesla
3825 2018-08-14 16:40:36 That must explain why the oil industry has been on gov’t life support since it began.
3826 2018-08-14 16:40:34 Gotta have that oil
3827 2018-08-14 16:40:21 mets du bi oil ça va les estomper
3828 2018-08-14 16:40:14 Maybe it’s because he’s made the correct moral choices in the past and been proven correct. He doesn’t facilitate invasions for oil...
3829 2018-08-14 16:40:13 I could never have it for a long time because all of the flavours I’d like contained coconut oil (yes it’s a pathetic allergy I know) however I’ve checked the ingredients and there are some that don’t so I will lose my Ben & Jerrys virginity quite soon I feel

3832 2018-08-14 16:39:53 Who is/are 'we', here? Let what happen? I'm not sure of the point you are trying to make. If you want trials carried out involving cannabis oil, them make your case. My issue is with those claiming cancer cures without evidence.
3833 2018-08-14 16:39:44 I took her to the vet and they told me to get some allergy pills but those didn’t work. I bathe her with an oatmeal shampoo and I put coconut oil on her. I put Neosporin on the scars and she licks it off
3834 2018-08-14 16:39:42 me making an Amazon wishlist: 

- various braces
- 3 kinds of biofreeze
- a bottle of tea tree oil
- two sizes of heating pad
- one (1) journal

so, i clearly dream big.
3835 2018-08-14 16:39:41 i miss those days where i used to train my ass off at the gym for 6 days in a week, prep my healthy meal, no oil no salt less sugar, just baked chicken breast and plain rice for every meal, had a cheat day once a week, never missed my supplements intake. damn i miss my old body
3836 2018-08-14 16:39:12 Then why are the Saudi's trying so hard to diversify? Why would they want to take Tesla private? Surely, they could just sit on their cash cow forever with no risk at all. Do you really think the demand for oil will be greater 25-30 years from now than it is today?
3837 2018-08-14 16:39:00 これは優勝ですわ！
3838 2018-08-14 16:38:52 People in the EU can just choose another country to buy from at the 'old' price. Won't matter which country the UK choose to buy things from, it will all cost more. Food, oil, gas, holidays, etc.
3839 2018-08-14 16:38:38 I would be honoured to rub oil into your skin and offer relaxing massage x
3840 2018-08-14 16:38:38 @ScottforFlorida Rick Scott is a corrupt self serving crook who has done NOTHING in his 8 years except pad his bank accounts with $$$ from Big Sugar, big oil and big polluters! #FuckRickScott
3841 2018-08-14 16:38:35 Oh sure, Trump is so afraid of Putin that he's confronting him head-on by  building up our military, castigating Germany for getting Russian oil, attacking Russian allies Syria and Iran, etc. But Trump & Putin ARE in agreement about destroying the Strzok & the #DeepState.

3844 2018-08-14 16:38:23 I get it—worth a look—but I don't see dots connected. Of me, you could say: "has done repeated business with multi-national conglomerate with ties to agribusiness and Middle Eastern oil wealth. Ran over $100 through the wash by accident in a pair of jeans in 1996." Suspicious!
3845 2018-08-14 16:38:12 Yet on the other side of the coin you want to force companies to host lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist?

In 2010, BO & Dem Congress were 1st to let China gov buy a US energy co. Why’d BO gov let a Chinese co buy world’s largest pork co, Smithfield Foods?
3849 2018-08-14 16:37:18 Paid all my bills  now i feel better lol now i can go buy me some tennis & a oil change  then I’m done spending money
3850 2018-08-14 16:37:11 I suggest only olive oil or coconut oil for cooking, and olive oil for salad dressings or to drizzle on veggies. Canola, corn, vegetable, & seed oils are not healthy despite being marketed as such.  Hampton Creek Just Mayo uses pea protein instead of eggs or soy as emulsifier.
3851 2018-08-14 16:37:06 Hey @cathmckenna can we please clean this s**t up? If only we could find a way to get our oil to market efficiently, maybe Canada would make enough $ to clean up our dirty water.

3872 2018-08-14 16:33:58 "6 kWh of electricity to refine a gallon" is another propaganda myth. In fact 4-6 kWh of *energy*, mostly oil feedstock & natural gas, & <1 kWh of electricity. When you mislead publicly on PEVs, you hurt all advocates credibility w/ public. Please don't. Stick to facts & science.
3873 2018-08-14 16:33:48 I would like to try something that was minimal on the psychogenics, and emphasis on the pain relief (CBD). The oil is legal here, but I’m not sure of potency. So far no effect from what I’ve tried. Would prefer to make my own, or grow my own. Can’t do that while it’s illegal.
3874 2018-08-14 16:33:32 Christ said: "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting... But when you fast, put oil on your head & wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting..." He could've said...
3875 2018-08-14 16:33:32 I need to go get my oil changed.
3876 2018-08-14 16:33:26 They start to get on my blooming nerves. People have hard earnt money invested here and are willing this on to succeed. I guess they are shorters but Ialso  swampys.

3880 2018-08-14 16:33:03 The truth is slowing coming out. This will be another nail in the coffin of this ill conceived pipeline. 

TMX was always just a shortcut to US west coast refineries. It has nothing to do with overseas markets or some magically better "tidewater" price for oil.

3900 2018-08-14 16:30:54 The book it’s based on, “Oil!” Is about the Signal Hill oil boom. The movie is set in the fictional town of Little Boston. But there’s a passing mention of Signal Hill in the film. Also, it’s probably the best film of the 2000s and Johnny Greenwood’s soundtrack is incredible.

3926 2018-08-14 16:28:07 A better question, IMO, is whether India has any regulations to protect the public from fraudulent quacks peddling homeopathy & other snake oil, esp for life-threatening conditions like cancer.

3934 2018-08-14 16:27:17 (1) Saudis can buy Tesla and close it, just like GE had to crush its EVs.
(2) What do we see in 20 years? Europe is moving away from gasoline vehicles already, but Tesla may not be the winning EV forever.
(3) Certainly oil will be phased out and Saudis will run out of it too.
3935 2018-08-14 16:26:55 Venezuela wasn’t even socialist. It was capitalist with government-owned oil used to pay for social programmes. The US obviously could not allow this so they colluded with the Saudis and crashed the oil price

3937 2018-08-14 16:26:51 "Monuments" makes the difference. If they were national parks he would have to secure Congressional approval. It has to with mineral resources. Apparently oil has been found & a vast reserve of coal very near the surface. There are still a lot of hurdles before any harvesting.
3938 2018-08-14 16:26:50 I work in Santa Monica and have for 10 years… without question @birdride has made this city better.  But if you prefer big oil over sustainable energy some people in DC would love to hire you.  Have at it.

3945 2018-08-14 16:26:15 Euan: You are veering off to misleading propaganda (untruths) which is dissappointing. PHEV maintenance based on engine miles, & only require oil change every 1-2 years. My Volt, +6 yrs, +145k miles, had 2 oil changes & 1 air filter. $50 total. That's IT. Please tell the truth.

3952 2018-08-14 16:25:14 @SuperiorHonda fuck you and your shitty ass service. Been here for going on 4 hours for a simple three month checkup (oil change, fluids, etc) and and getting a few filters changed
3953 2018-08-14 16:25:08 I like to see the derampers get tetchy on LSE. Iike for instance. Boyzee was trying to draw me out earlier. Wants a pic or RNS. Well Boyzee my pics come when they come. Roast.
3954 2018-08-14 16:25:02 My lunch was especially delicious -- cheese and avocado sandwich, slice of pizza, remainder of the avocado half with olive oil and seasoning, and blackberries. As I reveled in such a lovely meal, I speared my last blackberry and it exploded all over my face. Touché lunch

3961 2018-08-14 16:24:05 Who benefitted from Russia sanctions? 1)China wants Russia as hard ally,&now its top oil supplier is Rus. 2)Sanctions enabled foreign co in USA(that’d invested $billions)to get chunk of Russia’s LNG/oil markets to export USA’s energy future&make us dependent on foreign oil again.
3962 2018-08-14 16:24:01 They are definitely ubiquitous in processed foods and kitchen cabinets. 

I would certainly add soybean and corn oil to the list. Of course adding all bad oils could make for a crowded picture.

3976 2018-08-14 16:22:37 We can not get off oil. So get over it. I love the outdoors. We need to stop cutting down our forests. We need to protect our wildlife. We need to ban all guns. We need to stop trophy hunting. If we out lawed guide's for trophy hunting. Who would not like that?

3986 2018-08-14 16:21:49 Interesting piece in @envirotecmag: our client Adrian Griffiths, CEO at @RecyclingTech explains how their chemical recycling process allows typically "non-recyclable packaging" to be turned into an oil used to make more virgin-quality plastics.
3987 2018-08-14 16:21:48 You got oil money?
3988 2018-08-14 16:21:48 @royalenfield At least give options for choosing engine oil. Like two options - Liquid Gun or Any Superior Synthetic engine oil from other Manufacturers. Or Give us the convenience of choosing our own choice of engine oil for those bikes which are out of warranty period

3996 2018-08-14 16:21:10 Waiting to get your oil changed is probably the worst thing ever.

4000 2018-08-14 16:20:52 Angolan street vendors sell sugarcane, macaroni, spaghetti, cooking oil and other vegetables, Zim vendors sell mops and cockroach poison.. what are we gonna sell in other countries when our economy takes a nose dive... Nothing. A Collapsed economy is gonna humble us. Mark this.
4001 2018-08-14 16:20:39 Same in Huntington Beach wells are still pumping oil. Yorba Linda also has wells active in fact right on the Black Gold Golf Club course in Yorba Linda.
4002 2018-08-14 16:20:37 I truly HATE going to get a oil change ..  Idk why .
4003 2018-08-14 16:20:35 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes...
4004 2018-08-14 16:20:22 Has full relevance to humans 
These "rats" have used Crisco and corn oil on the rats
4005 2018-08-14 16:20:21 Pdvsa oil output down to 1.3 million bpd in July  and will continue to shrink. It is  a bankrupt company and what will replace it after the 20/20 bond  non payment and beginning of asset grabbing by creditors. To accelerate or not is the big question for creditors to decide
4006 2018-08-14 16:20:20 Or the fact that they nationalized the oil companies and went on a spending spree just before oil prices collapsed.
4007 2018-08-14 16:20:15 But it's all-natural. No sugar, no palm oil. So there's that.

4015 2018-08-14 16:19:30 The other aspect is that the Saudis see the end of oil, thus they're diversifying into electrics. Their injection of capital will propel Tesla forward, and spur more investment and growth in other electrics. Good long term hold strategy.
4016 2018-08-14 16:19:24 The US has been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, a shit-hole that doesn't even have oil.  Is this a "works program" to create jobs....for US contractors?
4017 2018-08-14 16:19:23 I think she wants some of that Moroccan oil for a bit of shine!
4018 2018-08-14 16:19:19 I don't have time to explain to fools who don't even understand what they read. The reason that our oil is so cheap is because we have no Pipelines to get it to market!!

4024 2018-08-14 16:18:25 Does that mean crude oil will no longer be exported to France for transformation and then sold back to us at a cutthroat rate? Because if we can build our own refinery at Limbe, won't we be able to export much more to other countries and increase our GDP exponentially?

That pretty much goes for ALL Dems, but is especially true for socialists as they can NEVER explain how gov will pay for the freebies!!  Just buzz words, phrases like "the 1%", or "big oil", or "the military"
4078 2018-08-14 16:12:04 Normally prices of fuels go up when the price of crude oil that we import rises,how come the price rise and we have our own crude oil that we even export?can we be explained?
4079 2018-08-14 16:12:00 Solid story/research here. I find it odd how dodgy cool is over the oil processing. I feel like it wouldn’t really impact the beer side if the public was aware they want to process buds into oil

4088 2018-08-14 16:11:11 I mean, Kenney's definately uninformed if he thinks it's as easy as building a pipeline.  We don't have the facilities to turn our raw crude into actual, useable oil.  He's just trying to push to get it built and using another party leader's stance to further it.

4104 2018-08-14 16:09:55 Not saying one causes the other. Saying a combination of a slowdown in demand from trade wars, threats of a SPR release and Trump desperately trying to get oil and gas prices lower so they don't affect economic growth were likely the biggest drivers that killed the rally.

4113 2018-08-14 16:08:59 In U.S. 1 out of 6 jobs is now involved in energy production. Largely thanks to a boom in oil & gas. Will stay profitable,if oil stays above $40 a barrel.
4114 2018-08-14 16:08:50 Trudeau bungled that file too. Shovel ready, privately funded, thousands of jobs for impoverished First Nation communities, Alberta oil to overseas markets, fewer trains. It was a dream project for Canada and they blew it.

4121 2018-08-14 16:08:13 Jobs leading to future growth are often partly assisted by the govt while industries scale. But even if we just stop the 4 billion direct subsidies to oil and charge at least 50/ton to clean up carbon garbage being dumped for free that would be a start. Most job growth is green.

4137 2018-08-14 16:06:38 Again failure that pipelines profits till it was stalled were going to Texas oil company share holders and Canada was happy for it to do so until they were forced to buy it and will be forced to sell it for far less than its worth nevermind the environmental risk salmon orca etc

4150 2018-08-14 16:04:36 Not sure what you mean, but if it's the recent supply insecurity stuff it's because of where our gas comes from. That's the blue bit on the chart, it's helped us get off coal/oil but it's only a stopgap.

4215 2018-08-14 15:58:39 Oil trade has been compromised by sanctions and there's a war taking place current in far East Europe that is creating uncertainty throughout central Europe and Asia. So yes we do have issues locally but being part of a globalised universe means we suffer unintended consequences.
4216 2018-08-14 15:58:39 How few people remember that World War Two was started by Hitler and Stalin TOGETHER AS ALLIES! The Soviets kept supplying the Nazis with oil from Baku right until the attack...which pre-empted their own planned invasion of Europe.

4222 2018-08-14 15:57:41 OK, but I think that battery technology has been around for a long time. NASA already had batteries that are used today. I'm sure that now they have something a lot better, what we will know in 10 or 20 years, when oil will end in the world!

4350 2018-08-14 15:46:49 Maybe they should boycott IS and stop buying oil from them instead
4351 2018-08-14 15:46:47 Import of crude oil will be costlier
4352 2018-08-14 15:46:45 #America is a slight net exporter of oil, thus we have tremendous political leverage over countries that get most of their govt budget from oil export (Iran, Venezuela,  Russia,  Saudi Arabia). We can raise/lower the price with minimal impact to us.
4353 2018-08-14 15:46:43 Plz, How did you guys turn your family fortune in 3yrs? 
Kindly sit & think about it. 
What was price of Crude Oil then & now?

Her: Can't believe i am going to spend the rest of my life with someone who smells like oil after work
4355 2018-08-14 15:46:24 I don't think things are back in Alberta I've been out of work since may need to go back to school because job prospects are in the toilet. My recovery from oil industry is going to take a long time
4356 2018-08-14 15:46:21 Hope you'll be voting NO on #AB84 this afternoon. You've signed the #OilMoneyOut pledge. Very alarmed by loophole in bill that would enable legislators to sign pledge but accept laundered oil money.

4371 2018-08-14 15:44:22 Still think that Crude oil longs take  position only to keep the markets in check, its a hedge on their equity shorts.  
Its run coupon clippers. Smart guys with no imagination. The smart brave ones have quit out of frustration or losses.
4372 2018-08-14 15:44:14 An oil change should not take 2 hours...
4373 2018-08-14 15:44:11 Why doesn’t Trudeau put the same conditions on imported oil as he does on Canadian oil?
4374 2018-08-14 15:44:07 Fellas, are you changing your own oil or you taking it to the shop?
4375 2018-08-14 15:44:04 Ever been to Hilltop Park in Signal Hill? Nice views, plus petroleum history sculptures. My grandfather worked for the Macmillan family in Hancock Park long ago as a cook. Macmillans owned Macmillan Ring Free Oil in Signal Hill.
4376 2018-08-14 15:43:58 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
4377 2018-08-14 15:43:46 I know it’s being used on cruise ships and oil drilling platforms. I’ve talked to a shipping company that was interested in putting them on their freighters but couldn’t get past the cost. I’ve also talked to one of the main corporations downtown about it.

4380 2018-08-14 15:43:34 Canada is a real economic mess. And all oil companies operating headquarters from Calgary with Canadian operations are looking money
4381 2018-08-14 15:43:30 During Modi's term, no after effects of economic recession to counter, crude oil prices were almost half of what they were in 2013, had an economic adv vis-a-vis other emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, China. But instead of using that opportunity, put speed breakers like demo
4382 2018-08-14 15:43:30 yep depends which #data?

4383 2018-08-14 15:43:09 Your mocking words relate to another part of this problem; That we're all being forced to inhale the smoking exhaust fumes from crude oil extracts like gasoline, which is part of Satan's physical form. This smoke is biologically radioactive too, and terrible for the body & soul.
4384 2018-08-14 15:43:08 The one that did usiness with ISIS on oil?

4389 2018-08-14 15:42:59 I've really appreciated this convo. I don't understand folks betting against Tesla but that's ok. 

The one argument I do make is that other countries are starting to kick our ass in renewables. This is a matter of national security. We can't be the last ones to move from oil...
4390 2018-08-14 15:42:58 This girl and her BF want me to pay $100 for weed that she brought and shared with me. Like wtf. You don’t go to a party bring liquor for everyone then expect them to pay. Well I guess since we used my car for the trip you can pay for my oil change  fuck out of here.

4393 2018-08-14 15:42:38 I’d like to see these mayo lovers put raw egg yoke and oil straight onto their hot dogs and pretend to like it. 
4394 2018-08-14 15:42:19 Osinbajo has made another brilliant move that doesn’t take much to do. Overhaul the SARS. You don’t need oil to sell at $120/barrel to do this. I wish we can have some Ministers and some few people sacked.
4395 2018-08-14 15:42:16 US dollar rising up...oil must go down soon
4396 2018-08-14 15:42:13 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4397 2018-08-14 15:42:12 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4426 2018-08-14 15:39:33 You seem to have little understanding of this whole conversation about Canada’s dependency on Saudi oil which is the topic you chimed in on. No one mentioned Australia. You seem a little lost here...
4427 2018-08-14 15:39:28 This dealer doesn’t even have free coffee or oil changes. I’ve been spoiled so bad. 
4428 2018-08-14 15:39:28 In 2013, crude oil prices were in the 90s. Calculating from 2010 is disingenous as there was the economic recession of 2009-10 which took a few years to overcome. Modi benefited from historic low oil prices but axed own foot with measures like demo.
4429 2018-08-14 15:39:25 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
4430 2018-08-14 15:39:23 What does that tell you about, say, gold’s price dynamics on Supply/Demand? 

Or more easily and to the point, you can just look at what new mining tech (fracking) did to oil prices, even as global demand continued to rise.

4441 2018-08-14 15:38:19 Corruption. They didn’t save for a rainy day, and when the price of oil fell they ran into terrible times - and didn’t listen to economists on practical solutions to rebuild.

4451 2018-08-14 15:37:27 The fuel lobby is so powerful that any technology will lose them! Tesla it's a nice car, but it's terribly expensive. Electric cars are the future of the world, but when? Why are oil companies controlling the development of electric cars?

4474 2018-08-14 15:35:23 i have been agonizing about this too. but they said the Turkana oil will be exported first, to test the market. Am still bitter about this
4475 2018-08-14 15:35:18 Yes. Beaten egg yolks are just oozing with flavor . It truly is just meant to add a fat to an otherwise dry thing like sandwiches. It isn't meant to make something taste different as oil, egg yolks and acid arent going to change the flavor much
4476 2018-08-14 15:35:10 Wondering how much money his family has tied to oil and how much kick back he’s getting to his campaign coffers from oil. Nothing like exploiting the presidency for financial gain.

4481 2018-08-14 15:34:25 Hi Paige...No, the Lawry's Seasoned Salt does not contain trans fat.  If any product contained this, it would show on the ingredient statement as hydrogenated vegetable oil.  ~Tina

4484 2018-08-14 15:34:05 Did you know a study says we can reduce our emissions alone by 6% if we used our own oil and gas instead of the East importing it? What are the chances that will ever happen? Not with this government.
4485 2018-08-14 15:34:05 Recalling how Exxon went right on with their oil deals with Iran, even during the strong sanctions from the Obama Administration. Guessing Exxon hasn't skipped a beat in its business/oil dealings now either.

4487 2018-08-14 15:34:02 My moms solution to anything and everything is to “put coconut oil on it”
4488 2018-08-14 15:33:58 I thought this when all I'd experienced was Hellman's and the like. But started buying, and then making, mayo made with actual eggs and avocado oil. Turned me right around on it.

4492 2018-08-14 15:33:36 Honestly girl pure organic coconut oil works really well, just melt it and leave it in your hair for 30 min/1hr before you shower :)
4493 2018-08-14 15:33:32 If you have puffiness however it’s supposed to be lit. I also introduced marula oil a month ago and I’m in love. This combined with Herbivore lapis oil = heaven. My skin is so so dry and the plant derived squalene is the holy grail I didn’t know I needed.

4508 2018-08-14 15:32:14 I mostly use olive oil or butter, depending on what I'm cooking. I find 2nd pressed (pure) oil holds up a bit better to higher temps than EV. It doesn't have the subtle flavors of EV but those will likely break down under high heat anyway. I use peanut for deep frying.

Cleared our heads and started fresh 29.445104,-94.6448099 nice little spot to listen to the Gulf surf, smell ocean, see fluffy clouds and chill with some beach RV folks.

4527 2018-08-14 15:30:06 I love the smell of petroleum in the morning! But seriously, no one notices or cares about the oil.
4528 2018-08-14 15:30:02 Between june-july ,you state that cost of importation has increased yet the crude oil price per barrel has decrease and the kenya shilling has gain against the dollar ,why then increase the price of supper?Pipeline loss factor also decreased.

1) Project military power in the Caspian Sea region (with its oil and gas riches)
2) Project military power in the Middle East: the navy vessels were used to launch cruise missiles to hit targets in Syria.
4533 2018-08-14 15:29:43 Regular oil changes are key. Good quality, correct spec oil, & always a Genuine Subaru Filter. Last time I checked, they were actually cheaper than a pattern part from Halfords. Always worth checking with an @subaruuk dealer if you want any parts - they might just surprise you

4535 2018-08-14 15:29:20 Miracles of miracles I found some creamy leave in conditioner (shea moisture castor oil one) without having to order it. I went to SIX stores that carry a bunch of shea moisture before I found it. Fun times. My hair is dry as fuck rn.
4536 2018-08-14 15:29:20 They sure didn't waste any time getting that crane on scene. Hopefully, it will be able to salvage the sunken tug ASAP, thereby averting a potentially serious release of fuel oil, lubricants, etc.
4537 2018-08-14 15:29:18 Yes but only if the oil money stays out of it
4538 2018-08-14 15:29:15 I've been following the plight of orangutans for years regarding palm oil. Won't buy the product because those beautiful creatures are tortured and killed to keep them out of farms. Disgusting

4543 2018-08-14 15:28:27 @Sincerely_Effy I did some research, the oil would slow down the process of breaking down antidepressant in the body, causing an overdose effect for the antidepressant.  This also counts for other ways of ingesting the chemicals. So it’s a no.
4544 2018-08-14 15:28:20 Getting my oil changed and there are 3 women working and 1 guy. That’s positive in my mind since car maintenance has often been assumed to be a “man’s job.”
4545 2018-08-14 15:28:20 People must stop using products with palm oil
4546 2018-08-14 15:28:12 I approve of everything he is doing, for a few reasons...

Gas and oil are never going to run out, and only reason there's a shortage, here & there...facilitated.

4557 2018-08-14 15:26:36 they’re clearly doing something extra . where you getting it done at? I’ve gotten mine done 3 times since I had a car and it took about 45 minuets @ good year. they wait till your car cools down, filter the oil and change it.
4558 2018-08-14 15:26:33 Co-existing but not really co-existing. Water meets oil.
4559 2018-08-14 15:26:31 Is it time for your oil to be changed?

Standard Oil Changes start at $32 including 5 quarts of synthetic blend oil and oil filter & full Synthetic Oil Change starting at $51 including 5 quarts of synthetic oil and filter

Stop by today!
4560 2018-08-14 15:26:20 The United States is a part of the UAE as he saddles up to their oil and money.

4565 2018-08-14 15:25:51 Nope! Keystone XL and Trans mountain are more than enough capacity for Canadian oil. Companies aren't building pipelines for them to sit empty. Expensive Canadian extraction is driving producers elsewhere in the short-medium term.

4578 2018-08-14 15:24:36 The data we have shows it to be consistently effective at improving mental health and quality of life. We can't say the same about a psychotherapeutic approach. If we did, it would be the standard method of treatment and advocating for it is essentially selling snake oil.

4592 2018-08-14 15:22:26 The researchers, say consumers can help by choosing sustainably-grown palm oil. The IUCN says replacing palm oil with other oil crops is not a solution, as these crops have lower yields and would take up more land.

4597 2018-08-14 15:22:01 Wild. A man just walked into this auto shop and says “I need an oil change.”  No appt, nothing. The tech says “I can get you in next week.” Man storms out angrily. Bro, you can literally make an appt online with no social interaction. Come on now.
4598 2018-08-14 15:21:55 I went in for an oil change at the dealership, paid, and by the time I got in my car, the sales people were calling me and asking me to come back and trade in my vehicle lol No thank you!

All of these ideas from the wife that never cooks!  LOL!  
4600 2018-08-14 15:21:48 Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, is trying to convince its oil customers to continue buying Iranian oil despite stringent U.S. efforts to curb Iranian production.
4601 2018-08-14 15:21:39 This is why challenging supply is an imperative. The urgency of the moment requires place based advocacy not price based advocacy. Putting a price on carbon is meaningless if the oil keeps getting extracted. We must #ProtectTheArctic #EndAmazonCrude #NoTarSandsInSFBay #NoDAPL

4605 2018-08-14 15:21:17 The processed seed oil is now a great concern, it raises the risk of diabetes. I dunno who actually makes mayo with animal fat though.
4606 2018-08-14 15:21:15 Should not you appreciate it had held its rate and in fact, improved substantially and now dipped due to global recession, high fuel prices but sure to gain again once Turkey and Oil prices crisis are over?  Had you forgotten your days of de-evaluating the rupee?

4608 2018-08-14 15:21:03 Iranian Light and Saudi Arab Light for Asia for September are now priced at the same level US$1.20 a barrel above the Dubai/Oman average.

For the Saudis, cut is aimed at enticing more buyers in order to take advantage of the refiners in Asia that are looking to cut Iranian oil
4609 2018-08-14 15:20:53 In 1948, one could buy a US dollar for less than Rs4, but in the past 71years, it hit a low record of 70.8 per dollar. Seems like we are marching against the economic policy and development. We are the biggest exporters of Modigas and importer of oil.
4610 2018-08-14 15:20:40 Thanks for playing Midnight Oil

4612 2018-08-14 15:20:22 #Genova #A10 #pontemorandi Italians should stick to what they know.  Failed banking and olive oil.  You  want something built right in Italy, trade your olive oil for Japanese  know how.

4615 2018-08-14 15:20:06 Just got an oil change for me car, so nothing exciting. That being said jumped back on to No Man's Sky and that game has me hooked now, hadn't played since launch.
4616 2018-08-14 15:19:59 The vehicle passed emissions, oil is changed, and now it's getting detailed. Next item on the itinerary is tag renewal...all told my day off has cost me roughly $150.

4619 2018-08-14 15:19:24 Neem oil smells of rancid garlic but removes burning and itching from the skin. I use it with lavender, tea tree, and lemon balm essential oils in it, to mask the smell and help the effectiveness.

4628 2018-08-14 15:18:45 Indy Eleven were getting a little screwed on the deal at Carroll stadium (from my understanding) so the move to Lucas Oil Stadium gave them a little more solid ground and footing as well as the move to USL.

Hopefully we see more work on a privately funded stadium in 2019!
4629 2018-08-14 15:18:34 One time I put actual olive oil in my hair... before the internet told me to... that was a

4637 2018-08-14 15:17:29 I would LOVE to have a bf or guy friend be genuinely curious as to how to improve their skin routine. Like yass honey let me make a whole PowerPoint presentation about exfoliating, moisturizing, and how tea tree oil saved my life (and can save yours, too)

4640 2018-08-14 15:17:00 Then we should talk about his son ex- president Jonathan. The oil funds PDP looted from Nigeria, if they share $1 million US Dollars to every Nigerian citizens, we will still have more than enough balance remains.

4654 2018-08-14 15:15:35 That's sad.... Mayo is extremely easy to make (eggs, oil and vinegar)
4655 2018-08-14 15:15:32 Getting an oil change. I’m just lingering around the showroom (mistake, I know) and go outside. 

Dealer asks if I needed anything and I tell him I’m just here for the oil change. He asks what kind of car, then the year. I tell him I just bought it, and he asks how I like it.
4656 2018-08-14 15:15:15 Aww. While I love my warlock, she will never be the first one out of the gate. XD
The fish are a big change from the beta. There you had to fish like hell to squish them and make oil and I guess enough people told them that was annoying that it got changed.

4661 2018-08-14 15:14:53 "Hugo Chavez declared the oil belonged 2 the ppl. He used the oil $ 2 eliminate 75% of extreme poverty, provide free health & education 4 all."

- Michael Moore, in a 2013 tweet which hasn't particularly held up well
4662 2018-08-14 15:14:52 Trudeau and liberals will boycott and landlock ethical alberta oil and purchase unethical Saudi oil. This is liberal logic.

4703 2018-08-14 15:09:24 Japan was provoked for years by u.s. economic measures such as, embargoes on oil, gas and metals. The u.s. also froze Japanese assets all of which resulted in Japan losing over 90% of impotred oil and 3/4 of overseas trade. Pearl harbor was a direct result of all this provocation

4735 2018-08-14 15:05:37 @realDonaldTrump We are very sensitive to oil sanctions, and we emphasize that by November, Iranian oil exports should reach zero and there is no exemption. Zero, zero, zero
4736 2018-08-14 15:05:34 There was no point of sector regulation. Kenyans increasingly paying more for petroleum products than ever before, regardless of global crude oil market dynamics and the shilling's relative stability.
4737 2018-08-14 15:05:31 Meh. It needs an oil change and a bunch of minor maintenance stuff. It'll get figured out.
4738 2018-08-14 15:05:29 Jagmeet Singh is a fool!  A very scary fool. Scour the earth for other countries to buy our oil from, regardless of their environmental and human rights records.  Shut down our own! Become dependent hot house flowers of the world.
4739 2018-08-14 15:05:27 If I believed in all the anecdotal data my patients tell me, we could probably cure everything with cod liver oil or white tiger balm. 
4740 2018-08-14 15:05:17 Oil is unsustainable. I'm working really hard to transition folks from oil and gas to EV solar and aerospace. Especially the electricians for solar. The older guys will be ok till retirement but the younger ones know better. It's a dying industry. Tesla is kicking ass. It has to.
4741 2018-08-14 15:05:16 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4742 2018-08-14 15:05:13 @realDonaldTrump America is the world's first superior power and does not fear the Iranian regime's toys in the Persian Gulf. India will have to cut its entire oil from Iran, not 50%, not 70%, but 100% to cut it, it only has time for November.

4757 2018-08-14 15:04:12 Hey try storing the peanut butter jar upside down before you open it for the first time, then when you open it there won’t be so much oil on top.  A little tip my son taught me.  #PeanutButterRules
4758 2018-08-14 15:04:10 His countless, useless showers every hour make me crazy. Dude California needs water! Then he slathers himself in olive oil!?!?
4759 2018-08-14 15:03:59 Aku ga bisa rekomendasi mana yg bagus/cocok karena aku pun belum cobain semua produk yg tersedia, dan kulitku pasti beda sama kulit orang lain. Biasanya nama produknya Cleansing Balm, Cleansing Oil, atau Cleansing Cream. Cleansing Oil lebih banyak sih ada dari Biore,

4761 2018-08-14 15:03:48 I set the mood right for date night: light some candles, bust out the coconut oil, put on a break-up album.
4762 2018-08-14 15:03:37 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!

4764 2018-08-14 15:03:25 Rescuing the American auto industry. Bringing Osama bin Laden to justice for 9/11. Investing in green technology to lower dependency on foreign oil imports. Restored America's reputation abroad after the stupid Iraq war. Inspired a generation into honorable public service.
4765 2018-08-14 15:03:10 'Closer every day' is not the same as viable.  You're pretty comfortable lashing out at big oil because "it's closer every day" but I'd bet you a barrel of oil that you're not living off grid.  And you get to decide what I am and what I believe? Typical liberal.
4766 2018-08-14 15:03:07 Sometimes, yeah. The budgets do shrink, though.  State funds and federal grants dry up and/or raise requirements. In OK, for ex, the state bet on the wrong horse (oil/gas industry) and when prices /barrel plummeted so did the state budget. Mismanagement, definitely.

4778 2018-08-14 15:02:20 Why do we not want to poke that? I'm honestly curious here.
Is it not true that they are more or less the same as Iran? Except that 15 out of the 19 hijackers at 9/11 we're Saudi?
USA buys oil from the Saudi's, others buy oil from Iran. Some people even buy oil from isis...

4781 2018-08-14 15:02:10 a lot of logging in BC used to take place in areas you can't drive to. they've cut roads into most places now, but there are still areas where they fly or boat the crew in to work 2 week shifts.

Aquaculture, hydro construction, & oil&gas work is also largely camp-based

4783 2018-08-14 15:01:55 There are so many alternatives to Palm oil. Read labels and put the package back when you see palm oil in the ingredients- you buy- YOU directly vote for and contribute to the deforestation.
4784 2018-08-14 15:01:53 Looking for a E&J billet oil inlet adapter. 

LOOK NO MORE, in stock

$45.00 free shipping within the United states.
4785 2018-08-14 15:01:50 Is it really incompatible though? Isn't the oil industry significantly larger than the Saoudis, with many more companies involved from around the world?
4786 2018-08-14 15:01:47 Analogous to Modena earthquakes in an area free of them for over 200 years when Hunt Oil fracked there.

4791 2018-08-14 15:01:11 This time ammi made it after watching it on YouTube. She kept on saying that hers will turn out better than mine. And it did. Asked her secret ingredient and she said nothing. Microwaved potato with a little oil and water... I don't even
4792 2018-08-14 15:00:46 So I tried using tea tree oil to help my scalp but that shit isn’t helping. Those with braids/dreads, what y’all use to keep ya scalp moisturized ?
4793 2018-08-14 15:00:41 I agree with Mkude on Cashewnuts... because other countries such as Malaysia had focused on one crop on Palm Oil and have very much succeeded.

4798 2018-08-14 15:00:18 Whats the best hair oil you guys recommend? I have pretty frizzy hair and suffer from some hair loss cause of meds
4799 2018-08-14 15:00:09 It's not even a science project. It's just oil, water and food colouring.
4800 2018-08-14 15:00:07 have oil bubbling away in the room kettle and always keep your long bow within arms reach
4801 2018-08-14 14:59:59 It's big money, oil, coal, chemical lobbyists.  Pay to play
4802 2018-08-14 14:59:53 De facto, perhaps. But that doesn’t change the fact that they are actually distinct (admittedly similar) condiments. Emulsification is fine (desired, even!) but it *must* involve oil & garlic. Starting with mayo doesn’t make it not aïoli, it just makes you a lazy prep cook..
4803 2018-08-14 14:59:33 The trick to making any fragrance last longer is oil & spraying it on moisturized skin.

4811 2018-08-14 14:58:34  @hippie_huduga @ponkrae what oil is that?
4812 2018-08-14 14:58:28 This is due to airlines adding capacity+high crude oil prices. A simple calculation would have told you what the numbers would have looked like.

If you buy when the pain is the most you are in for super profits when the cycle turns.
4813 2018-08-14 14:58:24 Start my morning with Syrian rue and Rick Simpson oil every day. I bless the decoction before drinking it, or have ddexd or my grandmother do so
4814 2018-08-14 14:58:19 I wanted a pony. Sometimes we don't get what we want.

The fact is nobody really wants to buy our oil, outside the Gulf. Only 7 refineries in Asia can handle our bitumen and so far they've all said no. There's a reason KM couldn't find investors or banks even w/ govt guarantees.
4815 2018-08-14 14:58:16 coconuts are incredible, god really snapped when she made them. Need an oil that will make you soft as fuck? Coconut. A refreshing beverage? Coconut! Need to murder someone? Coconut!!
4816 2018-08-14 14:58:15 Give back the money you stole and compensate families who have lost members to roundup and oil and gas cancers and racist police directed by your potus. then go into hiding as we don't like you.

4824 2018-08-14 14:57:12 • Lip scrubs are also great ways to healthily remove dead skin leaving you lips lush and vibrant. 
One fun and effective lip scrub recipe is to have 2 parts sugar, 1 part cocoanut oil, and 1 packet of water melon (or your favorite kind) of Kool Aid.

4831 2018-08-14 14:56:36 what I can summarise from iman's blog.
My skin problem: oily + large pore + scar + jerawat pasir kat dahi
1)CLEANSER
kne double cleanser since ada jerawat pasir. Better micellar water ->oil based cleanser (utk remove make up, sunscreen, minyak) -> water based cleanser (debu,etc)

4834 2018-08-14 14:56:27 It was over a $8 oil change
4835 2018-08-14 14:56:27 MBS went to Russia to talk about oil. Not weapons. He gets his weapons from Washington and UK mostly.
4836 2018-08-14 14:56:09 Did it 'spill' all that diesel, or is that the amount that was on board when the tug sank? I suspect the latter. Huge difference for a marine oil spill expert. Please clarify.
4837 2018-08-14 14:56:08 Ok I’ve had this thought lately, if you got like an oil stain on a shirt and couldn’t get it out, couldn’t you just put oil all over it so it’s darker? Then there’s no more stain.

4841 2018-08-14 14:55:10 Centre 1 has few, if any HMRC staff left. It’s mainly DFID. Tax offices are amalgamating and closing across Scotland. Likely that there would be an increase in jobs, e.g Oil Taxation office is mainly London based so would come back here.
4842 2018-08-14 14:55:08 ABD 1911 yılında Rockfeller'in Standart Oil şirketini tekel olduğu gerekçesiyle 5 şirkete bulmuştu. FERRERO IÇIN de aynısı yapılmalı.
4843 2018-08-14 14:55:07 10W-30 is a terrible substitute for honey. Go with 90- weight gear oil. 

And yes,  "this is bad because it didn't work after I broke it" is an amazingly bad take.
4844 2018-08-14 14:55:05 It’s getting closer every day. Do you read any of the research / development reports - other than maybe the oil industry ones??? Seems you are an oil industry defender / worshiper or you choose at least to believe their BS. That oil spokeswoman on TV ads has pathetic scripts.
4845 2018-08-14 14:54:48 Rick Simpson Hemp oil will help you enormously - my humble opinion.
4846 2018-08-14 14:54:46 Oil is actually 10% of our import and yes we can fill the void. But you didn’t the question about other business, doctors, university etc. Cancel everything? Ppl will lose jobs!

And if your going to walk this moral line, are you prepared to do it w Iran, China et al?
4847 2018-08-14 14:54:34 I hate poppers. That shit sinks and makes my dick soft. Smells like rubbing alchohol and oil
4848 2018-08-14 14:54:32 Yep. Both big oil investment in energy innovation and a huge effort to undermine energy source and use innovation has been under way. Sounds crazy but it’s true as there disparity and fierce competition between oil companies, and there is the timeline too. It’s fascinating
4849 2018-08-14 14:54:22 TUPRAS already reduced importing Iranian crude oil.:)
4850 2018-08-14 14:54:21 . Have you read any  Tesla financial documents or for ex assess the Solar Investments Musk did ? Ain’t Russian or Oil guy but wouldn’t touch this company at current price
4851 2018-08-14 14:54:17 I do not know a lot about skin, but I use coconut oil as a moisturizer for my face. It actually has worked best for my dry and sensitive skin. No irritation or burning feeling anymore, along with no more dry patches! I swear by the stuff for my skin type.
4852 2018-08-14 14:54:11 I doubt there’s real cream in there, some seed oil concoction. Probably why they call it creme.
4853 2018-08-14 14:54:03 Indiana hates soccer...while a large number of people in Indianapolis that love soccer get ignored. That's exactly what the state general assembly did to this club. Sports and politics... like oil and water.

The risk really is that if oil was to go to $100, we will go back to being a fragile country all over again and that is a whole different ballgame.
4856 2018-08-14 14:53:54 I'm more romantic than that. I'll oil your whole body while we make out.

4877 2018-08-14 14:50:32 So true. Under Trump we can expect all safeguards and regulations removed. Anything that will cost oil companies some of the $$ they make.

4884 2018-08-14 14:49:40 There are many sources for oil, we don't need theirs. Our entire trade with SA in less than 1.5% of our trade volume. Associating with that regime is not necessary or ethical

4894 2018-08-14 14:49:03 He's been drinking the oil.

Check out his connections to Armand Hammer.
4895 2018-08-14 14:49:03 Right, much better to vote for the snake oil salesman your party foists. After all, ignore that he represents the people and their policy, because of his appearance. A bit shallow, dontcha think?
4896 2018-08-14 14:49:02 It's easy to see why, Autumn!    
What's your favorite oil or blend to use in this little guy so far?
4897 2018-08-14 14:48:50 I am On Vacation. Thinking of how to replicate the smell of seaweed in an oil.

Question 26: 

Answer -  B) Replacing the oil and the oil filters.
4899 2018-08-14 14:48:43 Oil me up and start pushing.
4900 2018-08-14 14:48:34 I need a new humannature Sunflower oil. Nauubos na. ;~;

4902 2018-08-14 14:48:26 We require full synthetic oil so I know it won't be that cheap but thank you.
4903 2018-08-14 14:48:26 兄の藤兵衛さん
4904 2018-08-14 14:48:16 Bcuz the oil in Lebialem and Limbe, banana and Robber in the South zone, tea & minerals in the north zones is worthier than lives of Southern Cameroonians. That is what is keeping the ancestors in power. Nfon Mukete 101yrs old has two jobs, Biya rents a flat in Geneva 500.000e/n
4905 2018-08-14 14:47:50 Maybe they can try some Holy oil and Extreme oil from the Primary Christian Faith. It is a requirement of our Faith to give the Holy oil to the sick. It is: virgin olive oil, cannabis bud, myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil. Old Testament. Amen.
4906 2018-08-14 14:47:38 *dude with broccoli rabe mustache and aioli pants voice* yeah no, so like I understand the spring rolls themselves are meatless but I’m saying if you fry them in the same oil as the crab wontons then I don’t want them. you do? ok well I gotta say that’s a bit of a boner killer,,
4907 2018-08-14 14:47:33 ซื่อหรือโง่
4908 2018-08-14 14:47:19 I think a little for the caterpillars. But I still have these little spider mite(?) thingies on my lettuce. Someone said get some neam(?) oil for that. Next year the garden store guy said get the oil and buy some ladybugs lol
4909 2018-08-14 14:47:17 Great way to send spiders scampering: Get peppermint oil from the store and soak cotton balls in the peppermint oil. Throw them into the corners of your house and under your bed, cupboards, etc. Your home will smell like Christmas for a few days & the spiders will skedaddle.

4914 2018-08-14 14:46:59 I also have a small roller bottle with about 30 drops of essential oil in a carrier oil that I put on pulse points when I have been exposed to sick people. Going to continue to be important as we try to avoid passing bugs to our kidney recipient heading into the flu season.
4915 2018-08-14 14:46:58 God knows I love Jab but keep paint, oil, and powder far away from my food. No sir lol

4924 2018-08-14 14:46:24 I need to get an oil change because the miles that’s about to go on my car over the next two weeks is about to be crazy .
4925 2018-08-14 14:46:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and flourish here.
4926 2018-08-14 14:45:36 I am confused. These colors don't look the same at all. Even if they did, since when does Juvia's place or anyone own colors? I oil paint, so if I used color from Juvia's place palette are you going to say I ripped of JP?
4927 2018-08-14 14:45:20 my car is getting fixed today I’m about to treat my baby soooo good when I get her back, she’s gonna get an oil change, I’m gonna clean her out and fill her up with a full tank

4929 2018-08-14 14:45:09 After studying our dollar that is no longer tied to gold (Look into Nixon and the petrodollar) the only value our money posses is the fact that the world trades oil using the US dollar. Emerging markets are no longer doing that and our money will lose value at an exponential rate
4930 2018-08-14 14:45:05 I use their crystallized CBD powder to make my own oil, and use it for all my flights to help me sleep and not freak out. Super good product.

4932 2018-08-14 14:44:49 Pipeline is not necessary except to make it less expensive for companies to transport.....those savings go into their pockets, not mine.  I don’t care to add more ruin to the environment to earn Big Oil more money.

4934 2018-08-14 14:44:34 Do you believe there is no room for cuts? Anywhere? I voted NDP but I've been surprised at their absolute refusal to trim anywhere and just hope for oil prices to hit $100.

4936 2018-08-14 14:44:15 I poured olive oil into my ear canal and waited until the scratching stopped. Then I tipped the oil out along with a very small and dead spider.
4937 2018-08-14 14:44:04 @KellyannePolls @EricTrump @SecElaineChao @stevenmnuchin1 @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence If gas prices stay at these levels November will be difficult. Most cars use premium now which is above $3.50 a gallon! The “gas not the oil” refineries that Obama closed are the reason.
4938 2018-08-14 14:43:58 Use a foaming soap dispenser. The original soap in mine was used years ago and they are still going strong. I fill it with mostly water, about 75% water, 25% Dr. B. and then add approximately 20 drops of the immune boosting essential oil of your choice. #zerowaste

4949 2018-08-14 14:42:48 Secondly the country has to spend billions of dollars in building new infrastructure which include an export pipeline to enable commercialization of the oil discoveries. #TheGreatEnergyDebateKE

5033 2018-08-14 14:33:07 I did my oil change, changed my brake & reverse lights, took my car to the dealership and now I’m getting my inspection done all before 11 AM.... I’m on a roll today 
5034 2018-08-14 14:33:05 High key gonna make my room a Thai massage spa vibe.. starting with these oil diffusers & water fountain  sounds amaze
5035 2018-08-14 14:33:03 "Mexico cuenta con solo 9 años de reservas" 
- tan solo el año pasado se descubrió en el golfo de México El Segundo yacimiento más grande. 
 
Por qué no sigues a la revista oil&gas magazine puede que aprendas algo más no estoy cierto de ello evidentemente.
5036 2018-08-14 14:32:54 When oil was being sold for $110 per barrels they didn't save anything. Their ministers hired air craft for $10b a year and bought all the houses in banana estate. I can go on and on and on yes we Nigerians know PDP is better???
5037 2018-08-14 14:32:49 Cool. Car dealership in Beaverton, OR created an oil leak in my car during an oil change. 

Do NOT go to NW Jeep Chrysler Dodge!

Pipelines are the safest most efficient way to transport oil.

5040 2018-08-14 14:32:34 I realised I was a strong independent woman when I didn't flinch when the oil spat at me
5041 2018-08-14 14:32:29 They like the sales pitch of "socialism" but don't understand the impacts when you are an actual user of the product. Venezuela is a great example but the snake oil salesmen tell everyone that somehow, magically, we could do it differently and they buy it. It's pathetic.
5042 2018-08-14 14:32:22 The pipeline leaked oil into the river within the first year of operation.
5043 2018-08-14 14:32:10 Bought some olive pâté from @FranchiSeedsUK because the one from @Brindisa was really olive-y but too salty for us. Didn't know OH had opened it. He didn't add olive oil before putting back in fridge and it was mouldy :(
5044 2018-08-14 14:31:56 A good development. I wish the presido will stay longer so that those promises he made to us of the Niger Delta last time  when the president was on a medical tourism could be signed into law. ( relocation of oil companies to their operational bases, building of refineries etc)
5045 2018-08-14 14:31:55 Honestly I do sugar free creamer, table spoon of coconut oil in mine, and whip cream when I’m feeling spontaneous haha

5065 2018-08-14 14:29:50 Me too Phil speaking as some one who battled cancer & suffered enormously the side effects of chemo. There is light though as laws surrounding medical cannabis are relaxing. My own father uses CBD oil to elevate his symptoms due to severe arthritis & is feeling great 
5066 2018-08-14 14:29:48 Buying a car for your birthday is CUTE and all UNTIL every year around your birthday you’ll have to spend your little birthday spending money on renewing your registration, renewing your state inspection and getting an oil change and tire rotation  
5067 2018-08-14 14:29:46 Why are they taking so long to do my oil change take my car it only takes 20 min to do the actual oil change
5068 2018-08-14 14:29:46 When I go to the car dealership to get oil changed:

5073 2018-08-14 14:29:31 @mike_pence @SecretaryRoss @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls The closure of gasoline refineries is why the actual price of gas is high because that’s where the bottle neck is. A backlong of oil waiting to be refined but not enough refineries. Reopen and price will drop.

5083 2018-08-14 14:29:01 Big Oil has bought out disruptive tech (to big oil) many times over the course of history, simply to keep it away from market. Hopefully they won't be able to do that with Tesla, not sure they are going to be a top shareholder in any case, but we'll just have to wait and see.

5100 2018-08-14 14:27:22 This is a really poor headline Tom....everyone knows the Saudi’s are pushing into solar. They’ve talked about preparing for oil to go away for many years and recently about a 200b solar/battery project. This isn’t Exxon...

5110 2018-08-14 14:25:49 What? Is this what 56 inch stood for? Even with all the flaws, Manmohan stood straight and asked US to f*ck off when trade ban was imposed. This is going to affect oil price again and affect rupee as we were paying 50% in rupees.
5111 2018-08-14 14:25:33 @realDonaldTrump Time to open the gasoline refineries that Obama closed down. The price of gasoline is way too high. Unleash the oil reserves or something. If gas refineries are reopened the actual gas price will drop because that is how they keep gas artificially high.

5116 2018-08-14 14:25:01 Ask yourself, what changed? Centuries of relative peace and then some rich white idiots decide they have oil rights. All downhill from there.If they aspire to dominate then it’s probably from being put last for quite some time.They won’t get domination though,Atheism rises faster
5117 2018-08-14 14:24:50 Tell that to the fish , sea birds dolphins whales turtles ect ect. Ask them would they prefere home grown oil. Look at how much oil can spill in to the Ocean  from a super tanker for goodness sake.

5125 2018-08-14 14:23:38 If you have to speak logic at that time oil was trading at USD 120 with the Euro crisis and Taper Tantrum of the US. The point is there was not much appreciation shown for those external factors at that time?

5157 2018-08-14 14:19:30 how but, when imports are climbing faster than exports? data just came in - higher oil import bill meant July trade deficit was $18 billion.  Last time trade deficit was wider was in May 2013. Imports +28% while exports only +14% in July.
5158 2018-08-14 14:19:30 (2) In July, India's imports of Venezuelan oil increased vs previous months as delayed cargoes were finally shipped after meetings PDVSA-Reliance-Nayara, but the 2018 average is at 336,200 bpd, 17% below the same period of 2017 #OOTT

5170 2018-08-14 14:18:00 Mr. Ambassador, things could go worst. If the projections and estimates made by EIA are right, Venezuela will be under 1 million bpd in 2019, around 700 k bpd. Meaning Venezuela no longer will be an important crude oil supplier to the market.
5171 2018-08-14 14:17:57 Not a good comparison. Bush and Obama messed with Venezuela to try to destabilize the country because of???

OIL! Good ol’ oil. Just like Libya, Iraq, Iran and Syria.

Pretty sure US socialist want to recreate Denmark for y’all.

5178 2018-08-14 14:16:55 (1) India's imports of Venezuelan crude rose 37% to 423,500 bpd in July compared to June as US imports declined below 500,000 bpd. As Venezuela's oil production/exports continue falling, PDVSA chooses every month which market to prioritize

5290 2018-08-14 14:08:51 Oh, you may also want to factor in the price ceilings along with those tariffs. All of which incur dead-weight loss to consumers and producers. The Republican-led trifecta exacerbated the US oil crisis of 1973. Coincidentally enough, happened under the moniker “America First.”

5309 2018-08-14 14:07:00 3 questions I have about LA: 1. Half-windows - why? 2. Carpets - why? 3. WHY ARE YOU MAKING SPICY SALMON ROLLS WITH HOT CHILI OIL AND NOT SPICY MAYO??? This is the most bizarre one. Had happened twice on 2 different towns.
5310 2018-08-14 14:06:45 That's absolute tosh Rory. I lived through those times and the oil crisis was the root cause of the problems

5312 2018-08-14 14:06:37 >>They joined the anti-Baghdad Sunni's (Saddam soldiers) in Anbar and almost conquered Baghdad. They entered #Syria and defeated militants & #al_Qaeda. They started dealing oil with #Erdogan.
Until #Putin bombed them out of Business and cut them off near #al_Bab..

5313 2018-08-14 14:06:31 YA’LL DON’T EVEN KNOW THE HALF LOL. PEOPLE HUG/TOUCH ME A LOT AND ALWAYS PULL AWAY WITH “OMG YOU SMELL AMAZING AND YOUR SKIN FEELS SO GOOD.” IT’S MY OWN SHIT. THIS VELVET BODY OIL IS NO JOKE. I LITERALLY FEEL LIKE VELVET. ASK YOUR DAD.
5314 2018-08-14 14:06:27 I never thought I’d be putting oil on my face but wow it’s doing wonders on my skin

5317 2018-08-14 14:06:15 Donkey Kong Country got some underrated music. Oil Drum Alley and the King K Rool music 
5318 2018-08-14 14:06:08 Ok but if you go to pronto at 9am it’ll literally take them less than 5 minutes to change your oil soooo guess I’m just doing that doe the rest of my life
5319 2018-08-14 14:06:04 Femme power shirt w/ no bra: truly a mood, especially when you're headed to a hotel to oil yourself up and roll around all sexy-like on the floor.
5320 2018-08-14 14:05:55 yankee & bath & body works. those get the most scent oil put in the cores & their oil is the most concentrated. i worked at a candle factory for a couple years lol...learned a lot

5326 2018-08-14 14:05:27 This administration will probably do everything in its power to destroy the biodiesel industry. They’re only interested in big oil. Oh, and Trump’s  @EPA has no interest in reducing carbon levels.
5327 2018-08-14 14:05:13 Ok then you had yer chance.
Of course scots would be better off with 100% of oil and gas
Of course scots are right to want to run thier own country
Now why are you against indy again?
You seem extreme in your views now Ian,right wing extremist
5328 2018-08-14 14:05:02 I understand a lot of fans will be upset that the football lines will be visible for the remainder of 2018 Indy Eleven season but unfortunately that's the product of where they are. I'd rather they still be in Lucas Oil than The Mike.
5329 2018-08-14 14:05:02 Watch for potential slump in housing market and thus employment over Trump tariffs and ban on oil in November next. People who fear job loss don't move house.
5330 2018-08-14 14:05:00 Shell announce another 50 years in the North Sea... Wonder what they’ll be doing there? Paddling? I mean the oil’s running out, isn’t it?
5331 2018-08-14 14:04:59 Naw.. imma use it when I buy this SRT tho.. but even still.. it won’t cost me $50 for an oil change.. Lol RT @Bjones1128: @Consistent__D @__RayWoods5 Aye no lie I been thinking bout switching to royal purple lol you literally can’t find a bad review on it
5332 2018-08-14 14:04:46 Because he has sold his followers on a Big Oil conspiracy to take him down and stop his green-energy revolution - selling a big bad and then cozying up to the epitome of the big bad when you need it is hypocritical.
5333 2018-08-14 14:04:42 me to the hot oil in the pan when i was cooking: FUCK you
5334 2018-08-14 14:04:38 Dem dey use coconut oil for beards too?

Wetin Abisola no go use coconut oil for self?
5335 2018-08-14 14:04:27 Masing and his cronies are cancer. Misleading Sarawakian with oil and gas royalties, while the natives lost their NCR lands.
5336 2018-08-14 14:04:10 Need to get an oil change like yesterday I’m tripping.
5337 2018-08-14 14:04:08 Getting oil companies onboard makes sense to me. We need them to align their interests with our interests (clean energy). Having them own a piece of @Tesla is one way to do that.
5338 2018-08-14 14:04:07 56.32 target for minute wave 3 on oil
5339 2018-08-14 14:04:06 Not just don't have the time, but refuse to believe that a much higher EV isn't possible over a short time period. Overconfidence bias is the oil that lubricates the engine of gambling. How else do two people ever agree to strike a wager? They both can't be exactly right.

5347 2018-08-14 14:03:49 Coconut oil was the best thing ever. It soaks in quick and kept it moisturized enough that mine only itched when it wore off
5348 2018-08-14 14:03:33 leave the gun, take the canola oil.

5350 2018-08-14 14:03:23 Wasn’t that about US Oil with Koch Brothers financing the climate change deniers? Even all European oil guys are sponsoring the sustainable energy at some capacity including EV chargers at gas stations.

5352 2018-08-14 14:03:16 Nights out here gettin raped!!!! RT @T__Hill: I’m looking at these oil change prices like “Who tf y’all going to”
5353 2018-08-14 14:03:15 Then show me the field research that following his specific 12 steps leads to repeatable, provable positive outcomes. Don't give me anecdotal bullshit, give me data.

snake oil.
5354 2018-08-14 14:03:13 I sprinkled it with a tiny bit of Harissa spice and fried t in garlic infused oil 
5355 2018-08-14 14:03:12 Mix drops Oil of Cloves, Geranium Oil and Oil of Lemongrass in a small dishette together; dilute slightly with water. Apparently they hate the smell and keep away. Seems to be working here.
5356 2018-08-14 14:03:11 Imagine trying to virtue signal on the internet only to realize that every major 1st-world commodity you've used or consumed in the past 24 hours was brought to you via oil and gas.
5357 2018-08-14 14:03:08 Nope, I keep black oil sunflower in the feeder during the cold season b3cause higher fat and more bang for their buck, nutritionally. I haven't been putting out seed in the summer because the squirrels kept demolishing it. The cage suet feeder at least they can't get into.
5358 2018-08-14 14:02:58 I go to Home Depot.. pay like $35 for my oil and filter.. Then go pay Benton Nissan $12 to change it or let my boy at Hendricks dodge do it for free
5359 2018-08-14 14:02:41 クソネミから逃れる事は出来ないのだ……
5360 2018-08-14 14:02:33 "A natural gas and electricity supplier went off script by openly discussing the billions in subsidies the oil and gas industry receives. There was silence in the crowded task force room, filled with fossil fuel producers and lobbyists.” #NMleg
5361 2018-08-14 14:02:29 ?  Well not KSA for sure small benefit but federal reserve king dollar will be the most beneficial imagine with me the senario above would u expect Iran will stay on margin and accept no way will be full scale war with direct hit KSA oil well and remaining solid supply for oil
5362 2018-08-14 14:02:29 Why so skeptical? Musk is going to go private by becoming a minority owner to the Oil Kingdom, makes perfect sense.
5363 2018-08-14 14:02:19 Great write! Nail on the head. So why don’t these people get it? Snake oil salesman! Slimy

5365 2018-08-14 14:02:17 Being an adult is waking up early and getting your oil changed. I wanna be a kid again.
5366 2018-08-14 14:02:07 Think not upon what it might cost. Think only upon what we stand to gain.

it is seriously a no-brainer when you look at some other neighbouring countries, some with oil and some without oil. All have higher pensions, and must have better health services.
5367 2018-08-14 14:02:07 Clouds are gathering over the outlook for the oil market, as trade tensions and rising crude supply threaten to swamp demand growth, but some of the world's most prominent energy investors are convinced the price will return to record highs.
5368 2018-08-14 14:02:03 Now I'm just spitballing here. Could be he had a bit of "insulation" as he led the mighty Oil on their first ride back into the postseason. I dunno, just a thought
5369 2018-08-14 14:02:02 Hello. Late to the party, but agree with what the others said. Very individual whether chips cooked separately, always need to specifically check when eating out. Some places do gf night on regular oil changing day too.
5370 2018-08-14 14:01:56 once this corrective phase is done on wti oil, wave 333 awaits..most powerful wave sequence ...looking for a steep drop...
5371 2018-08-14 14:01:51 The highest kind is synthetic tho.. yea man go to the dealer cus folks taking like crazy for simple oil changes.. Lol you’d be better off gettin your own oil and filter from Home Depot and paying the $12 labor at a dealer
5372 2018-08-14 14:01:42 Gotta get a haircut this week. Car wash. Get an oil change. New toothbrush. New girlfriend. All fresh everything after a loss.
5373 2018-08-14 14:01:39 I also use it in oil form. I take a 1ml dropper daily and it helps curb my anxiety and neuroses. The thing I’ve appreciated most is not having to up the dose to continue achieving the desired result.
5374 2018-08-14 14:01:29 These so called humans remind me of the Kabbalah’s gnoles, put oil in the car and they pour car oil inside a car! Think about it... Amen!
5375 2018-08-14 14:01:26 protip: canola oil.

5379 2018-08-14 14:01:06 Why are so many of our own students rejected from Medical School?  Instead, over 18% of our medical graduates are Saudis!  We depend on them for medical care as much as we do for their oil to eastern Canada! 
This self-destructive policy has got to stop!

I don't trust in the strategic operation for the future of your project which may be delayed by conflict of interests of oil industry. I could be wrong

5386 2018-08-14 14:00:25 No I’ve got the cheating silicon egg poachers. I put a little bit of oil in then use a spoon to get them out

5389 2018-08-14 14:00:04 I’m at the dealer getting an oil change and the guy asked “do you know if this is the original battery?” I said “I’m not sure, I inherited this car from my father about a year and a half ago.” He goes “oh I’m sorry about that.” I said “hahaha he didn’t die, he just gave it to me”

5393 2018-08-14 13:59:35 Exactly......70% of everything moved....(most of the other 30% are non consumer stuff like coal, oil,  lumber, ect) and virtually everything everyone touches was brought, in some way, by a truck......
But she’s a liberal and clueless about the real world.
5394 2018-08-14 13:59:32 Because Trump now owns a percentage of Rosneft. When you own big oil - You protect it at all costs. Even it goes against your Oath of Office.
5395 2018-08-14 13:59:16 I had hit a wall..started get behind, and couldn't force myself to do it..

5396 2018-08-14 13:59:16 So I’m getting my car a oil change. Tell me why the lady is driving my car recklessly. Lady I dare you scratch my car and we are going to have problems

5401 2018-08-14 13:58:59 It looks like enamel painting for the fuidity. You work with oil, mostly, right?
5402 2018-08-14 13:58:57 Yes.. all oil on linens.. sooo much work put in. But glad to say that it was worth it 
5403 2018-08-14 13:58:57 Take 5 oil change has the best customer service!!
5404 2018-08-14 13:58:50 I wouldn't waste my oil
5405 2018-08-14 13:58:45 But all you did was lash out at an oil co on Twitter then admit that you just hate them.

5441 2018-08-14 13:55:24 Yes, you can't talk about any team that buys success with oil money, American debt, or Russian natural resources. Or anything about the Spurs. So basically you can only talk about Arsenal.

5446 2018-08-14 13:55:06 For athlete's foot, try tea tree oil. It has antiseptic properties & may work as well as or better than over-the-counter antifungal products. Apply a light coating of the oil to affected areas 2 - 3 times a day; continue for a week or two after symptoms disappear.#nutritionhouse

5448 2018-08-14 13:54:54 It is amazing how grifters flow up like oil on water to gather together. It is also amazing so many still support the biggest grifter.... our fake president
5449 2018-08-14 13:54:48 I use all that lol. But apparently you really have to use their primer. The oil one. The reviews say it really makes the difference.
5450 2018-08-14 13:54:46 If world is selling #commodities on back of demand collapse, surely #oil must face the same fate as #basemetals especially as macro freight volume and current activity indicators are saying. #disconnect #oott #supply $wti $bno
5451 2018-08-14 13:54:33 Tea tree oil is also very good.

5453 2018-08-14 13:54:04 Ppl say they’d be bored if they retired. It’s before 9AM & I’ve gotten my oil changed, chilled out at Dunkin’ Donuts for breakfast, and casually strolled around Home Depot looking for random crap. I look forward to being one of the older dudes arguing over coffee at McDs at 7 AM.

5466 2018-08-14 13:52:39 My recipe is pretty basic and incredibly yummy: sauté chopped onion/ green onion with bell peppers and a hotter pepper (2-3 jalapeño peppers or e.g. Poblano if you want something w less heat) in olive oil. Add mushrooms and diced tomatoes, some chives and coriander and salt. 1/
5467 2018-08-14 13:52:37 How much is y’all oil changes?
5468 2018-08-14 13:52:37 Didn’t think you accused me. My point was only that I think the conservative media is exaggerating the views of people on the near left. For monetary gains for the oil industry, NRA, and phamecutical companies.
5469 2018-08-14 13:52:35 getting my first oil change today. i wonder if i should make an appointment first or if i can just show up...

5478 2018-08-14 13:51:55 The reason why the unemployment rate is the highest in Sask is because you have a minority group of oil investors/ Freemasons paying of the politicians to reject the 63 million offered by the federal government for green employment initiatives, so how can we foster new industry?

5482 2018-08-14 13:51:30 @angusenergyplc you thinking of producing oil anytime soon or you just waiting for the kids to go back to school ffs..I mean it's not like uve had a year and a half to prepare ..oh wait.
5483 2018-08-14 13:51:22 Leave Saudi Arabia out of the deal. They have a terrible human rights record. Look at what they are doing to Canada right now. Big oil is way too shady to be involved

5485 2018-08-14 13:51:11 Still can't believe we gave those snake oil salesmen any money in the first fucking place. Fuck, they don't even sell snake oil, just water with a passing acquaintance of snake oil.
5486 2018-08-14 13:50:50 Like the ”shark cream” for sale at Reykjavik airport....you can get squalene without depleting the deep sea by eating/using olive oil

5488 2018-08-14 13:50:41 The current rape of the planet is for RE production and Biofuels being done by those that are raking in the money from Carbon Credits. Rape seed plantations, Sugar cane, Palm Oil,Corn and other plants are part of the issue. Mining for Rare Earths is the other RAPE of the planet
5489 2018-08-14 13:50:41 So what I’m hearing is I’m suppose to pop my hood and check my own oil every time I get in my car? Where is this in the rule book?
5490 2018-08-14 13:50:26 My guy, las las no work easy. Whether office or field all involve Mental and physical stress. But Oil Money sweet, if not you for dun leave am 
5491 2018-08-14 13:50:25 For now after November election and new set of sanctions on Iran different story they need oil higher remember us biggest producer so far overtaking Ksa and Russia
5492 2018-08-14 13:50:20 This. Great point. Once we get this administration out of the White House and have rational people making decisions again, I predict that Big Oil will eventually suffer a similar fate as Big Tobacco. There would be no way to stop it.

You also agree scots are right to want to run their own country.

5504 2018-08-14 13:49:17 No need for an international embargo on Venezuela’s oil exports. The Chavez/Maduro governments took care of that. There is little crude left to export as they destroyed the oil industry. Oil production plummets to what it was in 1947.  HT @RussDallen

5521 2018-08-14 13:47:23 Not new. But the fire season is longer and the fires are hotter and more destructive due to global warming, which is cause in part by oil and gas emissions.
5522 2018-08-14 13:47:17 Islam is to Christianity and Judaism et al as oil is to water! No man made law(s) will change that and the more migrants /Jihadists (Omar K.) let into , leaves the saying " Diversity is our Strenght" nothing but Opium for the taxpayers along with  3rd world hatred of us imo!
5523 2018-08-14 13:47:15 Many issues indeed, but Venezuela's problem was hardly oil price or election meddling, however.
5524 2018-08-14 13:47:03 #AAOG - pleased we’ve seen this churn and the sellers at this level, as when they start getting oil shows, there’ll be less to sell into the volume, giving a quicker move much higher

5537 2018-08-14 13:45:10 Oily rags were being used on refinishing a wood deck. The oil was very similar to linseed oil. The oily rags slowly heated to its ignition point through oxidation. When using oily rags, they should be placed in a sealed metal container.

There is no separate ministry for petroleum other than the one Kachikwu is heading, PMB is only using his own experience as a former petroleum minister to guide him right.

5549 2018-08-14 13:44:12 Fact: Modi's nationalist economic policies delayed Rupee decline against dollar and demonetisation put more brakes, or we would've hit 70 in 2015 / 80 in 2018. That's about 15-35 billion dollars saved in 3 years or 1 - 2 lakh crores in oil imports alone.

5601 2018-08-14 13:39:55 .@jonfavs and @PodSaveAmerica highlighted this morning how the DNC reversed a resolution that prevented certain PAC money, including oil and fossil fuel, while 2018 has been the vanguard of low-dollar donation campaigns (which are VERY successful). So confused rn...
5602 2018-08-14 13:39:51 I look good today who’s taking me out to get my oil changed your treat ;-*
5603 2018-08-14 13:39:47 METHOD: Combine 1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp of honey into a small bowl. Stir and add half a cup of oatmeal and 1 tbsp of coconut oil. Stir .Microwave for 5 seconds and apply to face ( leave the mask on for about 15-20 mins)

5607 2018-08-14 13:39:01 Mam in the 1st place BJP should not have politicized the RUPEE and CRUDE OIL issue in 2012-13.
5608 2018-08-14 13:38:56 You do know that private companies import and export oil, not governments.
5609 2018-08-14 13:38:51 Trump and his Russian backed oil magnate filled cabinet are the single biggest threat to humanity we face.. Isis and Nk dnt have anything on these scumbags. We’re set for apocalyptic levels of global warming & trump is responsible. Someone needs to save us all from them. evil
5610 2018-08-14 13:38:51 Same I’m always like “this recipe is bullshit it definitely needs more flower” or oil etc then I fuck it all up
5611 2018-08-14 13:38:39 Despite what we have been taught by our education system, "fossil fuels" do not in fact come from fossils, nor from the transformed remains of long dead organisms. The term "fossil fuels: was made up in 1892 by John D. Rockfeller, owner of Standard Oil Company in order to induce

5617 2018-08-14 13:38:04 You forgot to add, re: selling snake oil....you are media working for or with @MSNBC or @CNN or really any MSM outlet.
5618 2018-08-14 13:38:02 That definition isn't universal, though. For my part, aioli is garlic+oil, or at least garlic+mayo, but the internet says casually it means any flavored mayo these days, so idek.
5619 2018-08-14 13:38:01 So any donations are going directly to my mom. They are kinda fair behind on bills. And right now they have no oil for hot water. Which is kinda a big deal. Goal is to get 350 to get the tank full... anything will help love ur faces

For England though scots oil is a life saver.
When scots vote to leave westminster will show its true self by keeping scots oil by hook or crook.
Being a tory you will support that no doubt

5627 2018-08-14 13:36:50 UK, France and US created ME as it is today,meddling, drawing maps, protecting oil interests, support for this regime or that flip flopping, with no actual understanding of the ME.
5628 2018-08-14 13:36:43 kinda poetic thinking back to how the first show I saw at lucas oil stadium was troopers with welcome to the black parade as their opener
5629 2018-08-14 13:36:31 How many Democratic consultants also work for oil companies?
5630 2018-08-14 13:36:30 @KetoHiking Do you make your own mayonnaise? If so, what oil do you use? I've been using Hellman's, but would like to make my own. I keep doing it wrong.

5632 2018-08-14 13:36:15 Many have forgotten, but one of the first things he did was put a huge tariff on solar panels.

Because it's the GOAL of this Administration to make the world more dependent on fossil fuels.  Out with NATO, in with Russia/Saudi/US alliance of oil producers.

5637 2018-08-14 13:35:46 Also there were Native Americans at Standing Rock who fucked over other Native Americans. All of  this should be a big story yet when it's govt involvement and an oil  company involvement & media outlets being two-faced, well then this stuff cant really be talked about.

5641 2018-08-14 13:35:29 Was there on January 28, 1975 when it was an Imperial Oil base. Flew in from Calgary on a seismic crew. Spent six weeks working outside on Banks as a juggie. What's there now?
5642 2018-08-14 13:35:20 Hope they have some good oil on that menu. 
5643 2018-08-14 13:35:15 This can't be stated strongly enough: you have to start with high quality oil. And EVOO makes gross mayonnaise.
5644 2018-08-14 13:34:54 listen, anything other than an oil change is out my budget, we gon have to ride out...but I’m sure it’s just an oil change lol it’s just annoying

5651 2018-08-14 13:33:44 You usually pay for the insurance, if he is paying and not being insured he is due a rebate. If he is not paying a separate fee then he doesn't get it included with the oil? At least that's how my Umar account works.

5657 2018-08-14 13:33:00 The SNP are committed to clean energy not oil. The world is moving away from oil.  Remember comrade Salmond telling us In 2014 we would all be rich from oil just before the oil price collapse. Good job we didn’t listen to him eh!!

5662 2018-08-14 13:32:40 To be fair, Eisenhower imposed quotas on oil production and it was Nixon that got rid of the quotas for a tariff on foreign oil production. So, no... it was not the Democrats in control that caused the crisis. This isn’t hard to research unless you’re an economic illiterate.

5680 2018-08-14 13:30:59 I'm not an expert but sometimes dizziness may happen due to dehydration or low blood sugar. so basically if u feel light-headed, drink plain water then take a seat or lie down. If u have lavender oil, u can use it to massage your forehead/temples

5690 2018-08-14 13:30:07 @elonmusk You are my hero! The narrative needs to change. There will be no "short squeeze" because there are no real shorts, only oil money. You can't fight the highly subsidized evil oil industry through a publicly held company. They should invest in a privately held @Tesla!

5697 2018-08-14 13:29:08 Sanctions on oil trade from Iran has caused it too
5698 2018-08-14 13:29:07 A proportion of oil revenue would stay in an Indy Scotland of course. The GC Report excludes oil revenues because they are neither reliable nor worth very much at present. The SNPs own GC Report forecasts welfare cuts benefits cuts public services cuts and austerity over 10 years

5701 2018-08-14 13:28:43 Mayo is egg and oil. So everything with egg and oil is bad?

5703 2018-08-14 13:28:19 Including Extra Virgin Olive Oil? :-(((((
5704 2018-08-14 13:28:17 just diverging, price up value down, usually what institutions do with price when they want to be short.  the calendars have recovered a bit so it's not as bad as it was, dollar balancing bearish oil tho. Not a very risk on feel going into cash open
5705 2018-08-14 13:28:03 Trade deficit widened to $16.02 be in July, Oil imports surged by 57.41 per cent. #BusinessNews #Rupee #RupeeAt70
5706 2018-08-14 13:28:00 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
5707 2018-08-14 13:27:59 CBD oil? It helped me. Also, going to therapy. Often, you're too far into your emotional mind that you're not making the right choices about time management, perspective, and asking for help. A therapist can help you get back into a wise mind state so you can manage better. 
5708 2018-08-14 13:27:58 Try some oil Tin Man.
5709 2018-08-14 13:27:45 I started using coconut oil for my skin and coconut milk for my coffee, I feel like a big ol coconut head

5713 2018-08-14 13:27:14 India and Turkey both defied the US in buying Iran’s oil = the Indian Rupee and Turkish Lira plummet to record low!
This shows the great influence and power of the US dollar reserve currency.
5714 2018-08-14 13:26:54 No. We don’t import much oil (we export 4 million barrels/day, import about 760,000/day). What we do import comes mostly from USA. In 2017 over half came from USA, and about 10% each from Saudi Arabia, UK, Azerbaijan, plus a bit from Nigeria and Algeria. Varies from year to year.

5717 2018-08-14 13:26:30 This latest idea of corbynism without Corbyn is typical me-tooism from politicians bereft  of ideas,the ultimate sign of the career driven weathercock that’s has blighted our political engagement for decades.  Horrible snake oil salespeople
5718 2018-08-14 13:26:28 But a referendum isn’t set up that way. It isn’t THAT kind of vote. So you’re saying that if Yes has won, and the oil prices plummeted as they did - given that what we were told that was what could mostly sustain an independent Scotland - you would be in favour of another vote?
5719 2018-08-14 13:26:27 What kind of government holds a serious cabinet meeting over point feelee and keeps quiet about ever flipping million dollar wheel barrows?

Bamukukulu you need oil in the thinking chambers.
5720 2018-08-14 13:26:23 Gani pero wala man ko oil huhu. Gin try ko lipbalm, nakakas man ah :))
5721 2018-08-14 13:26:21 Not when we have imports that are critical to the economy. Oil in particular will impact heavily. LPG price rises will follow. Transport will become dearer. Prices will rise. Inflation will follow.

Only 14% of the oil produced in Scotland is used in Scotland

5726 2018-08-14 13:25:45 Well, you said that crime is what made Standard Oil and Armour meats. That is not factual if you even do a cursory look into. Standard Oil was able to corner the market on Gasoline because of their burning of kerosene. Also, I am not seeing anything about crimes and Armour

5734 2018-08-14 13:24:53 @PatsLaB, There are no plans this to launch the essential oil this year.
5735 2018-08-14 13:24:45 I know... tastes like straight up oil or even worse margarine.
5736 2018-08-14 13:24:21 cleansing oil is the best
5737 2018-08-14 13:23:59 So you admit that without westminster scots would be far better off as the oil revenues would stay in scotland yes?
5738 2018-08-14 13:23:44 I’m having such a clumsy day...I was cleaning the fryer & as I was pouring the clean oil in I forgot to close the nozzle so now I have oil all over my leg...and it got all over the kitchen floor

5745 2018-08-14 13:22:53 Yeah...those who aren't actually enamored with the "greatest showman" over there in Elon and KNOW a thing or two about business, know that ALL oil brands are introducing #Hydrogen instead.

5749 2018-08-14 13:22:10 Because extremists do not represent a religion. They are using religion as a basis for hate, but all that follow the religion peacefully cannot be held accountable. Instead of bombing countries for oil the UK could be working to bring about peace to war-torn countries.
5750 2018-08-14 13:22:10 Of course it only up a small percentage coz they dont collect the tax properly, how many times do I have to make the same point before you get your brain cell round that. Stop sticking straw men up I never said it was oil rich you brought that up you dishonest fool.

5753 2018-08-14 13:22:03 Tough isn't it. I think all we can do is try to vocally put pressure on big companies and lobby for legislation. Then as best we can shop around palm oil products. I know some will say they are sustainably sourced when its not the case.
5754 2018-08-14 13:21:51 80% in north sea is scottish aprt from the STOLEN BIT

5758 2018-08-14 13:21:37 oil would be gallbladder, sugar would be pancreas. It could be the amount or type of oil, especially if your gallbladder is already irritated. If you have some on hand, try some flax seed tea. Don't know why it helps calm the gallbladder, but people swear by it.

5776 2018-08-14 13:20:18 DNC can't raise enough money without big oil. They tried and failed.

Progressive candidates raise money without them, from small dollar donations.

DNC runs candidates against Progressives with the corporate cash they raise.

Where is that "Unity?"

It may not be food-grade quality, meaning it may have some additional chemicals added to be more viable and sellable. tengin yenne should typically be pure tengin oil
5785 2018-08-14 13:19:46 Any sovereign currency requires two things. 1] A sound reserve to support it & to resist attacks by those committed to it's destruction and/or profit by a reduction in international value. 2] A sound balance of payments programme. 
Both of these will need oil, at least initially.

After indy there will be no barnet and no 92% for westminster
Westminster IS the English parly,,its not scottish thats for sure

5796 2018-08-14 13:18:26 Harmful to the world & USA. Like selling natural parks out to oil industry. Ignoring climate change. Letting NK get upper hand. Child separation as punishment. Pardoning bigot Arapio to punish US for reacting to Trump on charlotsville. Cheating w/Russia. No gun control. & so on.

5799 2018-08-14 13:18:09 Bread topping, Olive oil vs. Butter: A recent study found that those that choose the olive oil, eat 23% less bread &amp; eat 16% fewer calories.

5803 2018-08-14 13:17:33 Saudis spend more per capital basis on defense to protect their “Royal” family from their people. We are hypocrites by selling them military equipment & continuing to buy their “bloody” oil. Were Freeland’s tweets intended to be helpful or just grandstanding for Canadian voters
5804 2018-08-14 13:17:27 I just saw a post concerning a pledge to eliminate fossil fuels. In the U.S., we consume about 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. It's doubtful that a pledge will carry much weight, considering the role the fossil fuels play in our lives.

5823 2018-08-14 13:15:30 Cool. I would think you would do that without the oil. But then I've never did that type of work before.

5825 2018-08-14 13:15:19 But I’m not a liberal college professor as I’m sure believed - in case you even care ... I just hate big oil for their raping of people and the environment - again, in case you even care ...
5826 2018-08-14 13:15:18 I can promise you it very much WAS allowed, and I've seen the evidence. You can find images of stone carvings and parchment all over the internet.
And aside from a few rich folks in Dubai, and maybe some oil workers elsewhere, no one is moving to the Middle East...

5837 2018-08-14 13:13:50 Yes, the currency effect on oil price is often underestimated. Geopolitics are fun to discuss but storage and USD tell you where the price is headed.

5852 2018-08-14 13:12:44 Yesterday oil was bad on made up Cushing inventories up “story” after it has basically been depleted to bare bones and is not even where inventory “stored” these days.  Many a made up narrative.  #OOTT

5856 2018-08-14 13:12:16 Another good point Tim 
Whether they want to take control of competition or not, we believe that it's about time the kingdom reduces its dependence on oil, and diversify. Apparently their strategy confirms that.

5865 2018-08-14 13:11:30 He could even turn around and say "hey, they were gonna invest this in oil extraction, and now they're investing it in TSLA!"
5866 2018-08-14 13:11:29 India faces a dilemma, as a result of its dependence on imported oil. Better livelihoods incumbent on development translate into an increased demand for cars, which in turn fuels India's oil import bill. India got a breather when oil prices fell, but these again went up.

Now BJP rule as of today Crude Oil is US$ 73 & INR is Rs 70 = 1 USD, INC rule in 2014 Petrol 78 Diesel Rs 56 Milk Rs 44 P-litre, BJP rule Petrol Rs84 Diesel Rs73 litre

5881 2018-08-14 13:09:59 Fats I use for cooking: organic coconut oil, lard, ghee, (sometimes) olive oil.
Fat I use on cooked green veggies: grass-fed butter.
Mayonnaise I use: avocado 

In other words, I use *no* seed oils or vegetable oils.

5884 2018-08-14 13:09:39 Is he referring to the subsidies given to big oil? They of course get to drill on public land for almost nothing, extract the resources, then sell it back to us at a huge profit. Not to mention the cost to public health and the environment which is always paid by us the citizens.

5910 2018-08-14 13:07:06 It's interesting though which fats (olive oil, fatty fish etc) they identify as having great effects on our bodies.

It definitiely isnt the fats we are sold by government dietary guidelines as being "good for us", no?
5911 2018-08-14 13:06:59 I prefer finely sliced, but sometimes I cut green cabbage into little squares. When you slice it you can add in some onion in the same size. 

I also love green cabbage by itself quickly fried up with some good oil, garlic, salt and pepper.

5939 2018-08-14 13:04:20 I would hazard a guess that it needs a comprehensive service and a set of tyres; it's also had a persistent oil leak for a while, which reputedly isn't excessive. Could be a simple gasket, or something more involved. Or it could just be ignored...

Then when you open it, oil rises and it’s ready!

6184 2018-08-14 12:39:26 What Dan doesnt mention here is that the self inflicted Brexit vote, supported by him, directly led to an increase in cost of our borrowing, oil and other via the collapse of sterling. Money that could have been spent on NHS. Well done Dan!
6185 2018-08-14 12:39:20 I largely agree that we shouldn't do business with KSA, but unless the CDN gov't decides to develop our own oil resources, that won't change any time soon.

6250 2018-08-14 12:31:00 Home pickled sounds excellent ... Grated raw with horseradish or a simple dressing is good, otherwise roasted quarters in olive oil or butter.

6256 2018-08-14 12:30:17 Scotland isn't oil rich though is it, it only accounts for about 6 or 7% of our tax income, please I'm asking you again do a bit of research before making a complete twat of yourself.

6264 2018-08-14 12:28:29 Palm oil is one of the major exports of Imo State. Dr @SamAmadi has promised to set up four  agro cottage industries every year in each of the 27 LGAs in Imo State. #NewImoMovement

6266 2018-08-14 12:28:07 Ironic. The MUSK cure for the horrors of pollution NOW runs, hides & jumps under the covers with the mob who made their $ from the filthy oil you disrupters all profess to detest so much.  Lies, diversion, hiding and compromise ALL OVER THE SHOP.  TESLA IS GETTING DESPERATE.

6269 2018-08-14 12:27:33 & of course spending $717 billion on war is a bipartisan issue. "Who cares if there are millions homeless or without healthcare? We need oil wars!"-republicans & democrats

6271 2018-08-14 12:27:18 So the UK spent £7million per missile bombing Libya & spent hundreds of millions on war in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect Scotland's oil?  You claimed you wanted 'productive' spending surely a few hundred thousand on Gaelic is more productive than bombing other countries?

Then I realise Dad has sent me his new salad dressing.

6277 2018-08-14 12:26:39 The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the classroom. It was a noise that set one’s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one’s neck.
6278 2018-08-14 12:26:21 I have 2 questions for you,,as a socislist you will have no probs answering.
1) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil and gas or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think sccots are wrong to want to run thier own country?
Be brave be truthful
6279 2018-08-14 12:26:19 @dawndish, you have such a good rep from cleaning up the wildlife in oil spills, how can you support Faux & Ingraham?  Won’t buy you again even though used it exclusively
6280 2018-08-14 12:26:19 yessss, i warm up some coconut oil in a small bowl and bring it it the tub with me to shave! Can get a lil gunky on the razor but works wonders nonetheless! 
6281 2018-08-14 12:26:17 Under Maduro's regime, Venezuela has accumulated a long history of  corruption, hyperinflation, oil production collapse and default. With  this background the Petro is not a good investment idea. There are much  better investment opportunities out there.

6287 2018-08-14 12:25:46 @Tim_Walz in years past you seemed to support a #CarbonTax, is this still true? Will you push MN into getting a Tax? According to the DOE burning oil, coal and natural gas makes up 82% of total emissions. The US accounts for 20% of world emissions. That's more than China.
6288 2018-08-14 12:25:42 If this is the case... Why does Big Oil get subsidies every year from Americans?

...wait, I'm not really good at metaphors, am I?
6293 2018-08-14 12:25:14 In any case this will improve reliance profits even more as oil psus will pay at this exchange rate to Ambani. Make in india will flourish before elections and of course export and IT revival. So who is complaining? Lol

6302 2018-08-14 12:23:35 Yes, Elon should be riding a bicycle from LA to Vegas for defcon.  Pretty sure that Tesla is more than offsetting any foot print by removing millions of gallons of oil and gas from being burned, not to mention all the coal not burned because of the solar. My Teslas run on sun!

6304 2018-08-14 12:23:26 Don't fall into this... It's not good for health.. After some years they will say its not good for health.. Like palm oil.. Refined oil etc

6307 2018-08-14 12:22:50 Not necessarily, that balance is nurtured by the state assuming the role of entrepreneur. If we can invest in our industry with an effective Innovation strategy, then we don't actually need oil to fund it, we'd have a sovereign currency to do so (another argument in itself).

6327 2018-08-14 12:20:54 I have to agree with Leopold here, not to mention trade wars are slowing the appetite for global oil demand along with the OPEC production boost. There could be a last pop higher this month, but after driving season we may see sub 60 oil for a brief period before going higher.

6351 2018-08-14 12:18:14 What was the price of crude oil that time and now? Is like saying if only Jonathan had given bail out, all states would have been able to pay salaries. And the next question would be where was the average N100/120$ per barrel of crude oil money?
6352 2018-08-14 12:18:02 I call shenanigans. One of the most popular diets right now (often among us aging millennials) is keto. And you use mayo for all its fat. Just not garbage Hellman’s.  I use mayo made with avocado oil (just to really drive my millennial-ness home).
6353 2018-08-14 12:18:02 LMAO, really based on crime huh? Also, racist logic? I am sorry that factual evidence is "racist", but I digress. Standard oil wasn't based on crime as it was bad practices and muscling out other competitors. It was actually a very cutthroat game back then and Rock won. Good Try!

6361 2018-08-14 12:17:23 Only known reserves surely? Post indy a new drilling license scheme would be required that could, no should, follow a Statoil model to stop the scandal that sees Norwegian taxpayers receive billions £ for drilling less oil due to Westminster incompetence and tax breaks!
6362 2018-08-14 12:16:59 Ugh!  That sucks....   Ok, next, have you tried Valerian root?  I can't get it as an oil here, but they do sell capsules in health food stores/ sections.  Other than than that, I'll show you some of my fave relaxation exercises when I see you in a few weeks!

6378 2018-08-14 12:15:27 Maybe low 60s...We are getting close to the Iran issue so it will be harder to control. Just yesterday and today we had a taste of what can happen when oil was pushed lower. This has rebounded USD 2+ on nothing.

6406 2018-08-14 12:13:01 the best analysis i've seen on oil past few years was after the price dropped to $26. the $$ value of the cancelled infrastructure projects was significant enough to cause supply/demand imbalances 2-3 years out. initial upside target $50 by jan 2017.
6407 2018-08-14 12:12:57 Sir would'nt the continous depriciation of rupee negatively effect oil supply, that too at this time when prices are comparatively on the higher side?

6422 2018-08-14 12:10:58 Until November 4, I think oil will be around 60 ( to help Mr President win Mid term elections). However, the pressure will start afterwards (sanctions on Russia) and oil will probably go higher to help the shale industry. However, I think depletion will escalate.

6439 2018-08-14 12:09:36 @swansonnolanMN Lori, As you are an advocate for removing pollutants from water, are you also in support of a #CarbonTax? According to the DOE burning oil, coal and natural gas makes up 82% of total emissions. The US accounts for 20% of world emissions. That's more than China.

6521 2018-08-14 11:56:38 How about balless pieces of shit that are afraid the squeeky wheel will get louder. We need to oil up those wheels and shut down the squeeks.

6525 2018-08-14 11:55:56 Seperate note, but it has always surprised me that oil producing nations (especially those with national oil companies) primarily export crude and not the more valuable refined products. Oh wait-fast cash vs capitalist risk taking.
6526 2018-08-14 11:55:51 Don't you know that dollar is becoming a strong because of hike in oil prices all over the world? Ask that to Dr. Singh. Don't give a chance to people to LOL.

6539 2018-08-14 11:54:17 Shark liver oil is found in many products, makeup, hemorrhoid ointments. It’s not illegal & it’s not traceable to prohibited shark species unfortunately. But it’d be nice to put some pressure on this company to stop selling it. Check labels & never buy anything that inc. shark

6560 2018-08-14 11:50:49 @elonmusk You say the Saudi want to take Tesla of the market to diversify away from oil. You're not afraid they're buying it up in an effort to kill the only real alternative to oil-based engines? The exact opposite?They're going to have all of you design go-carts after!

6580 2018-08-14 11:47:46 Like one person said to me. Iranian exports will find their way on the market regardless of sanctions. While some may stop Iranian imports, others like China, India,  Turkey will gladly take them. All it looks like is the oil will find other ways to get to market.

6590 2018-08-14 11:46:43 "If 1 million barrels per day or more of Iranian exports go AWOL, the current fragile supply-demand balance will be upended — potentially sending oil prices above the May peak," noted research firm PVM Oil Associates.

6599 2018-08-14 11:45:08 Yup, I’m sure. It’s confirmed in your quote; go to Helensburgh and see for yourself. The 520 are the only ones there. The drivers, cleaners and security officers. All the rest are based elsewhere, going home every month. 

They might as well be on an oil rig for economic impact.
6600 2018-08-14 11:45:05 Does anyone else think this is strange that the worlds largest oil producer and exporter would want to put money into an electric car company?

6602 2018-08-14 11:44:43 I use them a lot, lots of olive oil, all my life too, and I'm very healthy..
6603 2018-08-14 11:44:38 Nothing wrong with keeping your own currency, but the Norwegian Krone is probably not a great comparison due to Norways reliance as a rent economy on oil. Not a criticism but for them being part of the Euro doesnt make any sense.
6604 2018-08-14 11:44:10 I give you this: Venezuela has one of the biggest oil reserves worldwide. Venezuela is the poorest country of the world if you look it that way. Venezuela is Socialist.

6621 2018-08-14 11:42:15 An analogy for those real-life situations is:

a farmer eating more seeds than planting them.

A farmer has to accumulate wealth in case of bad weather (e.g. oil price drops in Norway, Venezuela). This means skewing the balance towards production instead of consumption.

6626 2018-08-14 11:41:35 So With Depreciating Rupee& Taking Current Fuel Price In Country Into Consideration,Can We Afford To Stop Crude Oil Import From Iran As Asked By USA Or With All Others Cutting Their Ties With Iran, Can We Take Advantage Of It By Allowing Comparatively Cheaper Crude Oil From Iran?

6628 2018-08-14 11:41:28 This makes me think that shark oil is about as generic as vegetable oil. We really do eat things without knowing what they are.

6641 2018-08-14 11:39:34 An open market would have allocated capital such their oil production wasn't dropping like a rock into the recovery and would have encouraged the economy to diversify. Every other oil producing region survived. One more socialist tragedy.

6667 2018-08-14 11:35:16 Damn, such a shame that I got a "Democrats don't take bribes from oil companies" tattoo this weekend. I guess I should've waited three months to be sure that was a real thing. #dnc
6668 2018-08-14 11:35:10  These doctor's are trippin. They wanted me to pay $842 for some Linzess, but got some peppermint oil capsules for $15 instead and they seem to do the trick. 
6669 2018-08-14 11:34:32 All great steps Sir except ghee which is high in cholesterol esters and very high in free radicals(bad for cells)..sesame or mustard oil as you are using would be better but less oil in general is better, get the healthy fats from nuts and seeds instead@sharan_india

6721 2018-08-14 11:27:53 Soot cleaning the boiler tubes also results in huge amounts of black soot. This is usually done every 12 hours when burning heavy fuel oil but could be more often if the fuel is very low quality. These heavy fuels are predominantly used because it is much cheaper than distillate.

6800 2018-08-14 11:16:44 Yup, he owns oil drilling operations in Golan Heights (Israeli occupied part of Syria). And Trump has openly sided with Israel as the rightful owners of the land they occupy which specifically includes Golan Heights. Coincidence I’m sure.
6801 2018-08-14 11:16:40 .@PodSaveAmerica covers why Unions with oil/gas workers are stepping on a rake in their own backyard by opposing action for #renewables (e.g. @DNC not taking money from #fossilfuel PACs). Doesn't help workers, or communities. Same issue in UK & its tooth-grindingly shortsighted.

6902 2018-08-14 11:01:21 Hey Caroline. There are lots of oils that replace Palm Oil, however it’s far more efficient for big corps to use as it yields a greater product for the amount used. Sunflower and rapeseed can be used as an alternative but it has downfalls in production and quality.
6903 2018-08-14 11:01:00 Except we have climate change ( specically climate departure starting) Your assumption is climate change is something off in the future. We need to substitute Thorium Nuclear reactors for oil quickly & add geoengineering or die. (Sorry about the pessimistic prognostics)

And may you be rewarded with many moments of joy and affirmation that rival what you felt after the last performance. #DCI4Life
6937 2018-08-14 10:56:21 Trying to explain the "football-business" in media to my dad feels like explaining why oil can't mix with water.

6943 2018-08-14 10:54:17 Some people cannot just make Heaven, how can you be using  anointing oil to masturbate!!!!!
6944 2018-08-14 10:54:04 Yes. They dont want to feel the cost of geopolitical manipulations (although the price drop put America's shale oil on hold).
6945 2018-08-14 10:53:58 Now let's take over the role the USA used to have as the stable hand of the world, and start having #oil traded in #euro by 2020.
6946 2018-08-14 10:53:58 McGregor, If you knew history, you would know that many, very many of America’s biggest fortunes, from Standard Oil to Armour meat and many more were based on crime. Black people are better advised, if we follow your racist logic, to stop committing only small crimes.
6947 2018-08-14 10:53:54 That's an added factor of Brent price. And no, we don't stand to "lose heavily". A rupee fall vis-a-vis dollar on same oil rate is barely a 1.4% change. So all things being equal, your price will increase (if at all) by 47 paise odd. For a 40 litre tank, diff of 18 rupees.
6948 2018-08-14 10:53:39 This guy is woke. I agree we don’t need oil. For I ride a unicorn powered by rainbows and star dust.

6951 2018-08-14 10:52:14 Indirectly it may as the import of not just oil but all other goods for which we are dependent on other countries will be costly so less impetus to import thus more usage of domestically produced goods
But thats really a long shot as in short run devaluation is only going to hurt

6954 2018-08-14 10:51:23 Själv tyckte jag att rapporten från Tethys Oil såg stabil ut, så jag köper på mig lika mycket som jag har gått back på dem idag. Ingen idé att hänga lätt för att Mr Market tycker annorlunda.

6957 2018-08-14 10:50:13 Agreed Ben... collaborative data collection makes sense if multiple users are going to be active in an area... has already been implemented with some success in the offshore oil and gas arena... stemming out of the offshore SEA process.

6959 2018-08-14 10:50:05 CBD oil is supposedly great for stress and anxiety, making sure you have a day off a week with your work switched off and maybe even yoga which can help with becoming more aware of breathing!
6960 2018-08-14 10:50:04 They did not invade Afghanistan for oil!.
Their were 3000 people killed in the USA in a Terror attack that is why they went in!
Now Corbyn said the attack wasn't done by bin Laden!!

6963 2018-08-14 10:49:36 Valerian will help. Tablets don’t taste as bad, but not as effective as tea. CBD oil helps but indica is the real anxiety reliever for ptsd other than benzodiazepines

6967 2018-08-14 10:49:12 That’s because the emissions junk the EPA requires the manufacturer to install. The programming kills mpg when in regeneration mode along with letting fuel into the oil since the extra fuel is sent in the exhaust stroke to heat up the DPF and burn the soot. B20 is great

6976 2018-08-14 10:47:48 2013 was very different - high inflation, Npa rising, receding global growth, high oil etc n most imp- poor export potential

6979 2018-08-14 10:47:17 And for sure it is going to be a race. Non-Opec is already losing the race against depletion. Look at the production numbers out of China today. Crude oil output in July dropped 2.6 percent on-year to 15.85 million tonnes, or 3.73 million bpd. according to the data
6980 2018-08-14 10:47:00 Got the oil pen on me at work

6992 2018-08-14 10:45:04 Right now hard to see a surge in drilling as the pipeline network is strained to capacity and new pipelines will only come online in mid 2019. There is no point in drilling if you cannot transport the oil.

7056 2018-08-14 10:33:17 I am from North East India btw. The previous government of Venezuela had a policy shift and used oil as their currency in full extent. It was corruption & wrong policy making. They are to blame at the end of the day. Well, do you condem China for the crash of Venezuala's economy?

7077 2018-08-14 10:29:53 Put oil in my car today. He was realll thirsty. But next time my dad calls... y’all already know I’m gonna tell him I’m a grown ass woman who can remember to put oil in her own car when he asks “are you putting oil in your car?”
7078 2018-08-14 10:29:47 why would an electric car manufacturer want to buy out the company with oil money..?
7079 2018-08-14 10:29:38 CBD oil ordered 
7080 2018-08-14 10:29:30 Saudi Arabia should be boycotted. For the last 50 years! They are North Korea with oil. We needed that oil before, which was a pretty poor excuse. Now we have no excuse but we still talk to them.
7081 2018-08-14 10:29:24 Why would Scotland go bust? Have you seen the oil price by the way? England probably will go bust once Scotland leaves, particularly if it goes through with it's current hard Brexit plan. But that's their choice.

7089 2018-08-14 10:27:30 and he has shown signs of wanting to do exactly that.
Attacking Greece(NATO ally),to grab islands and claim ownership of the oil fields under them in the Aegean is in his plans.
He needs oil to go to war.and needs war to grab oil.
So war unavoidable IMO unless he falls wt a bang
7090 2018-08-14 10:27:28 I don’t know if there’s a lesson here. Tell them denial of #ClimateChange itself was seeded by decades of intense misinformation campaigns funded by Big Oil? Oh wait, that’s documented :p
7091 2018-08-14 10:26:55 Fair enough, the NZGreens are aligned with the Aussie Greens aren't they. They want to make beastiality legal which might help trade for oil.
7092 2018-08-14 10:26:52 Good Morning @andrewrsorkin @elonmusk #SquawkBox. Very simply is Saudi Arabia willing to commit 6 weeks oil revenue to take @Tesla private and possibly future proof and diversify its economy, hedge against future carbon tax initiatives etc and very possibly offer full employment

7102 2018-08-14 10:25:19 Palestine or the lack of  a Palestinian state is collateral damage as far as the other Middle Eastern Arab states are concerned. It gives them the opportunity to promote terrorism within their boundaries whilst at the same time taking western currency for oil revenue.

7111 2018-08-14 10:23:40 Sure. I'm neither an advocate for socialism nor one for capitalism in their pure sense.

The US destabilised countries in the Middle East, North, West and Central Africa, which cannot protect or think for themselves; all for oil. Libya has slavery again due to capitalists.

7121 2018-08-14 10:22:45 I read an article by Chris Goffy years ago about the launch.  He rolled his down a mountainside and as the quiet descended on the tinkling mess at the bottom the dashboard piped up "Low Oil.  Low Oil." which seemed rather surreal.
7122 2018-08-14 10:22:44 McCrone wasn' repressed - was an internal document for the incomming government according to the author. The recovery was down to a number of factors such as stopping throwing money at unprofitable industries and yes oil revenues would have played a part - approx 4% gov revenue.

7300 2018-08-14 09:48:35 Are you sure this is coal driven? EU oil demand has contracted for eight consecutive years 2016-2014 but returned to a relatively strong growth since 2015 on the back of the oil price drop and accelerating GDP. Record high freight traffic, strong diesel demand etc.
7301 2018-08-14 09:48:22 #LetstalkEnergyKe  in comparison to other oil importing countries, Kenya remains competitive in the pricing of petroleum products.

They are also the words of the frightened fossil fuel industry, who are attacking renewable energy, because it affects their bottom line.

Oil and coal can never deliver that.
So they lie and go to war with renewables.

7358 2018-08-14 09:36:41 I guess, President Trump’s new oil sanction policy could cutIran’s crude exports by about 25 per cent.However,depending on geopolitical texture in the Middle East and Latin America, oil prices might jump to $90-100 per barrel by early 2019.

7364 2018-08-14 09:36:15 Same can be said for capitalist countries, minus the physical violence on the qualified members of its own society. Capitalist countries need poverty and chaos in other countries to thrive, so they can get cheaper oil, minerals, labour and trade agreements mostly in their favour.

7366 2018-08-14 09:35:56 There’s right wing and left wing in all countries - they create psy ops and propoganda to win people over for their agendas. 
The Iranian people do not want war. They have invaded no one- unlike our country who invades other countries for resources/oil. Especially the right wing
7367 2018-08-14 09:35:48 Palm oil too! They want us to eat like Kenyans? Neverrrrrrr!     
7368 2018-08-14 09:35:16 Good. Small doses, like small workouts, allow people to stay on a regimen.  Also cities should make their own drugs and their own internet.  These aren't fossil fuel industries we're talking about here.  We don't NEED to have oil deposits to make these.

7384 2018-08-14 09:32:13 I know some with honest intentions, eclipsed by liars installed by rich sponsors. We transferred carbon from long-term storages (coal, oil, forests) to the atmosphere. We see detrimental results. So we scale-back & use alternate energies. It's logical. Transition is underway.

7431 2018-08-14 09:22:30 There is a paste-style aioli made only from garlic and oil. It’s a very unstable emulsion and not my favorite flavor. Most cooks crush the garlic with salt, grind with an egg yolk and add oil very VERY slowly. It’s still unstable so much more slowly than mayo.

7443 2018-08-14 09:20:42 Yeah I do! Any oil works really, uses olive oil when I was stuck one time and was great! Haha 
7444 2018-08-14 09:20:41 False,UKGov fail to collect proper taxes from oil corps,only country in the world where they pay them not the other way round.

7445 2018-08-14 09:20:26 Is that a brand of olive oil or something you can only get at Borough Market?  Hope you can still get it after Brexit!

7457 2018-08-14 09:19:06 I see why Nigerians are sentimental: The leaders have poured the oil from the top, it’s trickling down fast. Politics in Nigeria is based on sentiments rather than results, rule of law/constitution.

7462 2018-08-14 09:18:42 Here, let me rephrase:
Mayo is an emulsion of oil, egg, lemon/vinegar, & spices.
Aioli, as I understand it is traditionally, only of oil and garlic. NOW most people just flavor mayo, as a convenience but it's not really an aioli any more than flavored margarine is a butter.

7649 2018-08-14 08:45:10 I hear you. But then It’s not about the man. Or the church. Or even oil. It’s about that type of man. And what their type has done to, or inflicted upon, the rest of us.
7650 2018-08-14 08:44:41 Avocado oil has a great smoke point, pushing 500f.  Very neutral flavor for frying. Only down side is migraine trigger factor. It’s a great add in ketoland. If you’re going K for T2D, be super aware of glucogenisis, the crash is unreal fast.

7693 2018-08-14 08:36:48 Bornean orangutan numbers more than halved between 1999 and 2015, mostly due to the expansion of palm oil plantations. When a forest is cleared to make way for palm oil, orangutans are left without a habitat. Worse still, some are brutally killed.  Let's stop this.

7700 2018-08-14 08:36:10 20 years ago, #western NGOs said #palmoil need to be certified to cater for conscious western customers. In 2004 #RSPO was formed, and today 22% of all palm oil is certified #sustainable and conflict-free --- yet no buyer. It is multi-layer superfluous certification #scam.

7796 2018-08-14 08:18:57 An even better question: why is Philippine inflation still rising steeply even after oil prices and the rate hike have already been priced in by the market?
7797 2018-08-14 08:18:49 Volatility in major currencies has risen to a five-month high amid the selloff in emerging markets that was brought on by financial turmoil in #Turkey . Trading in Asia is mixed, both European and U.S. index futures point toward a higher open and #Oil is up.

7831 2018-08-14 08:13:38 It always comes down to money, greed & power! Hanging onto the past finite fossil wealth generation sources instead of leading the world into the future!

7840 2018-08-14 08:11:52 Palm oil will be listed in the product ingredients. Use of palm oil is not recent. A lot of palm oil is now from sustainable farms, but there is still deforestation to make way for farms in some places. Key is to use your buying decisions to influence policy in those countries.

The worship team sets the atmosphere for the preaching if there is no anointing there will be no revelation to give to people because of the lack of the presence of God in the atmosphere..

7854 2018-08-14 08:10:09 That's because religion is based on fear, kind of like how some news channels promote war. They use your fear of anything and tell you they have the cure. Religion, verbal snake oil. Designed for the weak and fearful.

7858 2018-08-14 08:09:27 Plus Obama had his ajenda on the Iraqi oil. Him and his team including Hillary Clinton wanted to destabilize the Middle East to steal Oil from them. There is so much info you need to do research on the truth behind the Obama and Donald Trump.

7879 2018-08-14 08:03:26 The word fact itself is dubious & many cases only theories pushed by some group of people. In the past facts such cholesterol being bad, statins to reduce cholesterol, coconut oil is unhealthy etc. were all facts that now stand proven wrong. 
7880 2018-08-14 08:02:48 Thank you! The problem with vegan substitutes is that many contain palm oil.

7905 2018-08-14 07:58:35 Technically MCT oil is exogenous (external) fat so you are adding calories. If that works for you great!  Personally I drink bone broth with a bit of added salt to taste when fasting.

7924 2018-08-14 07:53:51 I’m actually more radical - I want oil price regulation restored. Plus I think tax effort improvement could help fund subsidies.

7928 2018-08-14 07:52:48 It is! I had an Italian friend in Glasgow, and her mother-in-law sent her Italian olive oil and homemade passata. The difference to the supermarket stuff is just striking. When I passed through Italy in July, I bought 2l of Olive oil and a few kg of pasta...

7935 2018-08-14 07:51:18 Yes it is worrisome  it should be rupees 50 to a doller this great richest nation. Do you it costs Rs 16 or less per litre of 100 octane fuel Than why 80 bucks. Crude oil is bought at lower market rates 100% paid in advance but delivered later to our demand consumption! Storage?
7936 2018-08-14 07:50:45 There's enough space on that sign to say "so much oil"... and they didn't even do that much.

8030 2018-08-14 07:32:17 Not sure I agree. Maybe hard to interpret, but it's a sign that the underlying environments are pretty different to have such a change. Also it can be a way to agglomerate related OTUs for simplifying to make things plottable.

8071 2018-08-14 07:27:05 Dear BBC, I am sure that the Oil Industry are paying you a fortune to report this nonsense about Electric Vehicles. In order to slow down the inevitable transformation to a clean transport system. As my previous tweet shows, deliberately directing your readers with fake news.
8072 2018-08-14 07:27:04 I know it’s getting cold bc my coconut oil is turning solid
8073 2018-08-14 07:27:00 I’m throwing everything into my work and just focusing on what makes me feel good. This morning I bought an essential oil diffuser from @amazon and some @mujiusa essential oils to create a little zen in my life. I’m such a hippy! 
8074 2018-08-14 07:26:48 ASTM D323 is Standard Test Method for determining vapor pressure of gasoline, volatile crude oil, and other petroleum products. It is used to determine the vapor pressure in a closed container at 37.8°C (100°F)

8076 2018-08-14 07:26:31 Reading the thread, it's clear many people don't understand this complicated issue even a little bit. For one thing, discrimination. For another, many working class people contribute to corporate PACs, even at oil companies. This is not a simple issue.
8077 2018-08-14 07:26:25 @EnergzdEconomy not enough attention is being paid to #turkey issues and it’s impact on oil and global economy.

8082 2018-08-14 07:26:06 @dickstrawbridge I live amongst a community of men who are proudly bearded and middle aged. You are somewhat of a role model we were wondering if you used anything, oil or wax to keep the face in check.

8088 2018-08-14 07:24:35 God provided you with a good friend, your husband,who stand for something.  You are a very bright woman and well spoken.. A lot of your peers are jealous of you.. Be peaceable with them, God will see you through. Read your Bible with the baby, and anoint that head with oil..
8089 2018-08-14 07:24:08 ask the expert......how much does each of these countries subsidize the consumer price of oil products?
8090 2018-08-14 07:24:00 @natgeostaff there is a space needed between “oil” and “Italy” in “...produced about 40 percent of all the olive oilItaly exports.” #IamACopyEditor
8091 2018-08-14 07:23:44 Yes, it is. But that's more than nullified by rising cost of imports, especially when India imports 80% of its crude oil requirements. Good for IT cos and bad for many others.
8092 2018-08-14 07:23:37 We let innocent people get hated because of these people, that's true ISLAMOPHOBIA, against terrorism, but dealing and selling jets, weapons and buying oil from a state that has created every attack in our countries respectively.

8107 2018-08-14 07:21:45 @UKLabour Snake oil selling again!
8108 2018-08-14 07:21:18 So many have full fuel bunkers. We dived loads of WWII wrecks in the 80's. Some had oil leaking back then! By now many will be degraded enough to collapse & release their load. Each dot represents a potential oil spill. Even Fuelling ships out there full, 100% cargo, waiting...
8109 2018-08-14 07:21:17 Correct, it was not necessarily the annionting oil
It was Faith
8110 2018-08-14 07:21:02 , me thinks, someone is cashing out on the transportation to tracks tender and another on the oil export cz honestly huezi niambie we oil and a refinery at changamwe then export that and import ingine ya consumption
8111 2018-08-14 07:20:57 Have you tried tea tree oil? It’s my lord and saviour when I break out on the monthly run... 
8112 2018-08-14 07:20:48 Soyinka. Why did you gave out your daughter in marriage to Amaechi? I it not for oil wealth?
8113 2018-08-14 07:20:48 What happens if the car starts leaking oil once it has reached some age?

What if other drivers can have a car that can goer higher than this? How would "overtaking" work?

Sounds like a good idea but doesn't seem practical to me
8114 2018-08-14 07:20:37 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stay away from products with parabens. Stay away from products with parabens. Is it NISIM or NHB? Best shampoo for hair loss. or analogous. How do I locate the right URL. I remember. Can't find it.

8119 2018-08-14 07:20:10 this is the solution to india's current account deficit. If every indians produces sufficient amount of mitrogen then there will be no need to buy  expensive oil from those "uknowwhom" in the GULF

8122 2018-08-14 07:19:48 My dumb self went back again & the same thing happen. This time I called and complained and all the manager offered me was a free oil change next time. I’ve never been back since. They don’t know what they’re doing.

8128 2018-08-14 07:19:07 Why would the saudis do that when they sell so much oil?
8129 2018-08-14 07:19:04 If you get a bump on your nose from your nose piercing put tea tree oil on it constantly you’ll thank me later
8130 2018-08-14 07:18:51 Btw at current production rate they still have enough oil to last around 90 - 100 years or so
8131 2018-08-14 07:18:44 I’ll never go back to Walmart for a oil change again. I went a few days before we drove to Utah a few years ago and my car started smoking by the time we hit freeway. They didn’t screw the cap on all the way so oil was all inside the hood.

8148 2018-08-14 07:15:14 Related to the below is the fact that Saudis have seen the writing on the wall. They are bolstering the bankrupt oil fund, selling off Aramco and any other state businesses; they will also drive the price of oil up as a last push before we move off oil. Mark my words.

8160 2018-08-14 07:13:29 They could make even more if they gave the community a fair share. Peace for business is what the community will give them in return of a fair share. It's good that we lose the Ksh.400M but in that case realize that the Turkana community is bigger than that oil.

8162 2018-08-14 07:13:20 Uh... do you.... do you know how oil refining works?  You realize we can't just pump it out of the ground and put it into our cars, right?

8172 2018-08-14 07:12:17 International price of oil seems to have stabilised... Gold and gems are re-exported, so are crude oil refinery products, we get highest remittances in the world, plus our software and other exports become competitive. So a weaker rupee +stable oil price is net net a +ve.

8183 2018-08-14 07:10:29 It was suicide,not external. One time founding member of OPEC,after nationalisation of Oil in 1973, Venezuela had irresponsible monetary and spending policies. No other industry was developed other than cash cow oil. Which is not doing well. Now they are left thieving in the seas

8198 2018-08-14 07:09:29 Baddest combo back then in University... Ego plenty and you go belleful... With palm oil
8199 2018-08-14 07:09:14 Who says you, please inform me of this so called "checkered past"? Because all I see is misplaced context regarding wreath laying for people who were murdered. New Labour destabilized modern Iraq to exploit oil reserves. Give me Corbyn any day over murderer Blair. #MyLeader

8207 2018-08-14 07:08:08 Rub coconut oil down the length of your shins. Really really get your thumb in as hard as you can bear with long strokes. 
8208 2018-08-14 07:07:34 Think lobbyest and big money. Oil is not going to back off of paying politicians to pollute up to the end. And convince Congress to allow the disservice to humanity is OK, as long as it pays Congress well, and paid thru the lobbiest channels. It is the sad and should be stopped.

8210 2018-08-14 07:06:42 Not sure what you mean 'viable' and not needing tax $, as we have been subsidizing oil... to the tune of trillions up til now. Would you consider them viable.

8213 2018-08-14 07:06:05 #CroozefmNews Endangered monkeys and apes will almost certainly face new risks if Africa becomes a big player in the palm oil industry.
8214 2018-08-14 07:05:46 What about imports Sir? Mainly oil which unfortunately increases the CAD. Just like IT Dependencies are shaping out from primarily from USA to other countries, hope currency dependencies also change, may help in the long run.
8215 2018-08-14 07:05:35 Very absurd view sir. How can manufacturing costs be low now in India with 2 important factors? - 1. India imports over 83% of its crude oil requirement & with depreciating INR, manf costs will increase besides inflation. 2. India has free pricing by OMCs now. Chicken/egg story.

8217 2018-08-14 07:05:33 Scottish GDP for 2018 (accounting for only 9% of oil revenues) is around £201 billion for 2017/2018

How much would an independent Scotland's GDP be with 94.6% of north sea oil output be when attributed?

More importantly what would the rump UK GDP be with out it?

8220 2018-08-14 07:05:17 I love this but what do we use instead of palm oil? Is there a way back that can at the very least, stop this?
8221 2018-08-14 07:05:15 Oil is also a finite resource, allowing Saudis to hold more oil in reserve which will most likely appreciate in value as the rest of the world depleted their resources

8262 2018-08-14 07:00:21 The North Sea Oil money was used on current spending (e.g. M25 and other infrastructure) and tax cuts.  So the people did benefit.  Maybe not the wisest use of it, some savings would have been better but the people still benefitted
8263 2018-08-14 07:00:15 .............The nationalization
In 1960, Castro nationalized all U.S.-owned businesses, including oil refineries, factories and casinos. This prompted the United States to end diplomatic relations and impose a trade embargo.

8294 2018-08-14 06:53:41 Invest in clean energy and THEN fight against Canada's pipelines. Fighting Canada's pipelines BEFORE we have clean energy makes Canada dependent on foreign oil like that from Saudi Arabia and us Canadians don't want that.  See the logic?

8340 2018-08-14 06:46:10 For make in India foreigners must be assured of world class infra and logistics as a pre requisite. Are we are in a position to afford that?.And what abt a price inelastic commodity like oil which we import heavily?

8343 2018-08-14 06:45:47 1/2 From the US perspective, even if it didn't need a drop of Saudi or other foreign oil, these supplies are still of paramount importance to the world. Keeping one of the world's largest suppliers of oil dependent on the US military for protection increases US power.

8345 2018-08-14 06:45:02 Increasing emissions is the point of carbon-pricing. Gov as oil cartel agency is aware the clean cheap electron on road/rail was competive decades ago. Delaying clean fuel standards to 2021, with Green Party carbon complicity, serves to hide the oil cartel is not market compliant

8355 2018-08-14 06:43:38 I go 2 cups of beans, 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, 4-5 garlic cloves, 3-4 bay leaves, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp cumin, black pepper, 1 tblsp olive oil, 5 cups water, then I add more salt and 1 cup of water plus  1 tblsp vingear to the slow cooker .  Cook on high to soften onions.
8356 2018-08-14 06:43:11 5% sudden increase in the Turkish Lira this morning is fought with plenty of USD bidding which makes it lose a quick 3%... Hedge funds smell blood, they're not going to leave the Lira that easily; $usdtry #Forex #Fx #EmergingMarkets

8360 2018-08-14 06:42:27 In other words - one spreadsheet with the exchange rate on one cell; the latest oil price per barrel on another cell.

United by the magical multiplication function.
8361 2018-08-14 06:42:08 1) Exporters are always happy when rupee falls. However what about the Oil Import bill and electronics imports? and to some extent gold. That creates a massive hole in India budget 2) For Make in India one has to create entire ecosystem & it will need time, policies and effort.
8362 2018-08-14 06:41:56 Oil is still at 70$ a barrel ....it 35 dollars cheap than in 2014.. government had good money around 300billion ...it still putting high petrol and diesel price for doing more government schemes some are unnecessary

8629 2018-08-14 05:56:38 1 party vs democracy.  So, democratic socialism might be ok?  Which is why Norway’s much smaller oil wealth was managed better for decades - far before Chavez came to power - and was used to diversify Norway’s economy in part through gov owned industry.  Ok, got it.

8639 2018-08-14 05:54:01 Good to see Macron perceives China's threat in the SCS! I wonder what France's response will be when China opposes oil&gas drilling in France's former colony of Vietnam?

8640 2018-08-14 05:53:18 Isn't every invention a solution to a problem?

8649 2018-08-14 05:51:54 Believe I read where we export far more of our own oil than we sell in this country.  Also doesn't include all the stuff Trump is doing to open up off shore drilling in what were forbidden waters of the US.  And from what I've been able to find Exxon never did pay up.

8680 2018-08-14 05:46:29 I’m not 100% sure but it has something to do with debt. CITGO owns the refineries that sends Venezuela fuel and lubricants for their oil operations. In addition to the cash that they used to receive This is absolute financial #caos

8768 2018-08-14 05:29:18 Yes. I've had it on while I've been sleeping with eucalyptus oil in it. It helps a bit at night, but during the day is the worse for this cough. Mucus is clear, so there's no sinus infection. There's nothing in the cough at all. It's so violent and exhausting.

All the stuff you use everyday made in Asia, how do you think it gets here?

It gets here on ships that use oil via the Suez Canal. Both key points there are Middle East related and one remains even when Oil doesn’t.

8876 2018-08-14 05:09:45 On the other hand, it's completely understandable why they would be interested. Oil is getting scarcer and more out of favour and they are investing heavily in renewable energy. Interesting developments. Or is he still playing with the short sellers?

8882 2018-08-14 05:08:00 It isn’t possible to disaggregate inflation rises due to currency devaluation and therefore rises in imported goods/raw materials and inflation due to much higher oil price. You are way too simplistic.

8894 2018-08-14 05:05:44 So if we are so against SA why are we still buying their oil. Doesnt make any sence to me as we have our own. DUMB
8895 2018-08-14 05:05:35 Yes herbs can be cures for diseases. The juice of the plant is the essential oil and they 26 more times powerful than dry herbs. They cure diseases all the time. Again just getting the information out so everyone has access it to the information.

8930 2018-08-14 04:59:33 You make a pretty obvious point. But Scotland would go bust before you know it (i see no-one mentions good old oil nowadays when talking about independence). England wouldn’t do much better. That is why we’re stronger together.
8931 2018-08-14 04:59:31 Trump wants us dependent on Oil. Rosneft. Hence the tax on solar.  He  is alienating us from allies to increase dependence on Russia.   Damaging our markets by implementing huge tariffs and shifting the markets to Russia.

8948 2018-08-14 04:55:18 This is why Putin has said that it is not Russia's long-term interest for oil prices to return to higher than $70 price. It would lead to overproduction of expensive shale oil and ruin the oil prices afterwards to $$20-30 again.

9046 2018-08-14 04:40:26 From a strategic perspective I think EAfrica/Gulf proactivity towards protection of trade/oil/gas is supportable. T&T - I have a foot in Sir Humpy's Orangery on this one... Question - has T&T Govt asked UK Govt for RN assistance - my first question really...

9048 2018-08-14 04:40:16 The natural  oil your scalp produces helps it maintain moisture that was your hair doesn’t break as often. If you wash it frequently you’re removing that natural oil. However if you don’t wash it for a while it looks really greasy but people can use dry shampoo

9050 2018-08-14 04:39:54 There is desirable treasure,
And oil in the dwelling of the wise,
But a foolish man squanders it.
9051 2018-08-14 04:39:34 You should do a little reading.  Oil from Bakersfield, CA is "dirtier", as is crude from Alaska, Nigeria and several other regimes without adequate environmental standards. We lead the world in producing ethical oil. Everyone can have an opinion.  But try being educated.
9052 2018-08-14 04:39:27 There is desirable treasure,
And oil in the dwelling of the wise,
But a foolish man squanders it.

9057 2018-08-14 04:38:36 This sort of thing happens to me all. the. time!! It's shockingly hard to name Russian and African oil companies, and mercenary/private security companies.

9059 2018-08-14 04:38:25 Everything that has a beginning, have an end. A foundation build or created on lies & fraud for the love of Oil can never last! That's the nature of Life. Nobody love this contraption called Nigeria because its a jungle. Biafra has risen to fall no more because its God's project
9060 2018-08-14 04:38:08 totally worth burning the midnight oil doing up the info graphics. I need to do up more practice for that. Keep doing other design, till never touch that area. Sobs.
9061 2018-08-14 04:37:53 Why don't we move the Indian Ocean to Turkana and save our country the cost of transporting oil to Msa? Just thinking big #WaititusChallenge

9064 2018-08-14 04:37:21 This ... I have always felt like the outsider been called a hippie for my love of homeopathy & essential oil & honey or tea. 

They don’t know how to the moment  now they run & hide
9065 2018-08-14 04:37:10 Right, so it’s not easy and not profitable but you want somebody to do it anyway. Who do you propose does it? The government? Do you want the government to purchase, refine and sell oil? Or do you want oil to be more subsidized than it already is?
9066 2018-08-14 04:37:02 Thanks  lmao you know it, got that on deck wit my Moroccan and castor oil keeps my head hairy lmfaooo

9071 2018-08-14 04:36:14 Q. Do Crawford and Black share the same motor oil for their respective greasy hair?
9072 2018-08-14 04:36:06 For what!? For oil? For fragile egos of grown men!? For stuffing someone’s bank account in hope theyll piss some change on you!?
9073 2018-08-14 04:36:02 Correction: Port Lincoln proudly calls itself one of the best frontiers for oil discovery, but many fear that’s now under threat due to some over zealous fear mongering by ignorant and biased green activists at the ABC.

9082 2018-08-14 04:34:34 For my foundation, I have to mix it with the matte and pore less, because I got a shade too light and for texture, and I put it under my eyes for concealer, because that's all I have, but I STRUGGLE to get it to look nice, once my oil kicks in its gone lol
9083 2018-08-14 04:33:55 I think that's it. Use big words, like charlatan or plutocrat, to remind his supporters, that yes they do have shit for brains, have been completely swindled into that same old GOP tax cuts for the rich snake oil that they did swallow hook line and sinker from Putin's submissive.
9084 2018-08-14 04:33:46 鏡あるのが悪い
9085 2018-08-14 04:33:45 For not being known lmao  maybe oil I guess
9086 2018-08-14 04:32:53 Then you would love all of my families weddings  the washing of the feet and the rubbing of oil on the head  and might even have a praise break
9087 2018-08-14 04:32:51 Quite the little rig he has there. I watched that one and another one after. Seems they both incorporated co2 in their method. Wonder what the different is between conventional essential oil extraction and these gadgets. 2nd vid mentioned it never got above 148f which is below bp

9090 2018-08-14 04:32:32 He’s not really in the mood to go out, and he’s about to say so, before he picks up “Pepper Is Exhausted” cues. He smoothly gets up from his chair, wiping oil on his jeans.

“The place on 3rd Avenue sound good? I’d offer to clean up, but I think this makes a useful disguise ...”
9091 2018-08-14 04:32:22 U mean Venezuela's ongoing trade war? No thx. Venezuela was one of the fastest recovering countries until Saudi Arabia got OPEC to surge their oil prices in 2014 b4 the country could diversify it's assets. Counterfeiting crisis doesn't help matters either.
9092 2018-08-14 04:32:04 Sanjeev,

9118 2018-08-14 04:27:26 I bought some almond oil, I just want to see what scrambled eggs taste like with it, instead of the usual canola/sunflower seed oil I use.
9119 2018-08-14 04:27:06 Why does the text state that the 4th scenario is the worst case, and in the graph the impact on oil demand is the lowest out of all scenarios (1.53%)?
9120 2018-08-14 04:26:47 I have a feeling most colleges and universities are already in line with his beliefs.
9121 2018-08-14 04:26:43 I spray my pillows with lavender oil mist weekly.
9122 2018-08-14 04:26:26 ohhhh hmmm was it a hydrating mist or setting spray LMAO ok if u have face oil try that next
9123 2018-08-14 04:26:14 Sounds to me like "Security Professionals" should stop selling snake oil and find out what they are talking about. The election infrastructure is not as insecure as they would like to believe. Yes...I am involved intimately with the elections infrastructure.
9124 2018-08-14 04:26:05 @realDonaldTrump is probably getting a cut of Omorasa’s book sales, so the snake oil salesman in him just can’t help himself.

9133 2018-08-14 04:24:13 The LNP spending taxpayers money on Coal-fired power stations when business won't touch them as an investment is like investing taxpayers money in whale oil after the combustion of Coal to make electricity was discovered.

Stupid & backward. #qt
9134 2018-08-14 04:24:13 So all the main characters on Dynasty are replaced? At least Steven was explained with an oil rig explosion and plastic surgery. But Fallon is just the ol switcharoo
9135 2018-08-14 04:24:09 What oil did you use for it?
9136 2018-08-14 04:24:02 My friend gave me a hot oil treatment to try out on my hair. So I used it on 1/2 of my hair and I washed it out. Then went to use it on the other half and I realized I cannot get my fingers or anything through the side I used it on.
9137 2018-08-14 04:23:57 How many independent businesses, technology startups or novel innovations could be funded w/ the estimated final price tag of $20B? The pipeline provides Canada with little to nothing, considering long term economic externalities. Review how Norway manages its oil revenue.

9145 2018-08-14 04:22:53 For sure, but I have to give him credit for at least saying he is expecting a pullback and oil to go under 60 first. Most are just permabulls that say buy always and it's going higher. He sounds pretty honest and giving better advice than most I've listened to here on Twitter.

9159 2018-08-14 04:20:37 A tiny investment in quality at each commit that pays back 100-fold in  all the commits that come after. A drip of oil to keep the machine  spinning without friction.

9162 2018-08-14 04:20:17 On the phone, David Shulkin proclaims to President Trump that oil executives are excessively fastidious. Vladimir Putin watches Netflix.
9163 2018-08-14 04:20:14 Seems weird we have had big downed crops in the past and the only problem I had at the start was some faulty Hyd motors that were pushing too much oil through the bypass. We are in rocks and hills so you think we would have more problems. This is 6 years on our W150’s
9164 2018-08-14 04:20:10 boil a green tea packet, rub it on your face, then open up the lil pouch and put the tea over the pimple and leave it on. uhhh lemon juice, tea tree oil, ice cube to the pimple,  i dont know thats all i got but the tea works pretty good

9168 2018-08-14 04:19:58 2/ The salinization of fertile, loamy soil (by oil and gas drilling) will be permanent without flooding to overlay the topsoil -- which means the desertification of wherever we greedily pump for gas/oil. I've been referring to Southern California (where I am)… (con't)

9176 2018-08-14 04:19:08 Into the sewer drains as a kid when they changed their oil in their car. Nobody does that now. We didnt have blue boxes or bottle and refund recycle systems. Now we do. It takes time.

9179 2018-08-14 04:18:39 I have to use aloe, charcoal, miceller water, coconut oil, alcohol, Dr Bells ointment, detox tea, vitamin e, chlorella, eat right & drink water until I’m nauseous just to try to have clear skin.......... toothpaste on my nose right now....... my Daddy fault 
9180 2018-08-14 04:18:38 I feel that. I tried the "bulletproof" coffee with just ghee and stevia  I was being cheap lol. But I bought mct oil and also am adding a bit of almond milk to it so I'm hoping I like it 
9181 2018-08-14 04:18:29 castor oil can work wonders for your skin
9182 2018-08-14 04:18:29 •gassing was staged by israeli government not by assad. you can verify on your own im not fucking google.

•can’t think of a country that hasn’t done that. war was never pretty, but the U.S. shouldn’t enter into one to protect oil at the cost of millions of civillian lives.
9183 2018-08-14 04:18:28 By the way, Nixon, Ford, Carter and the oil cartel ran us into the ground. The 911 terrorist screwed our ecobomy.. by comparison, when Trump took over, we were in pretty good shape. Not perfect, and not everyone, but generally in good shape.
9184 2018-08-14 04:17:51 We must cull critical shark costumes and coalesce consumers to create community oil reserves. Why not?
9185 2018-08-14 04:17:47 전했ㅇㆍㄱ용
9186 2018-08-14 04:17:26 already thinking about getting taco bell after work tomorrow. long gone are the days of me being an oil free whole foods vegan L MAO
9187 2018-08-14 04:17:16 I don’t think that’s true. Have you seen Death of the electric car? Oil has power but until we can build sustainable enegery without oil, we’re hooked. To build solar panels it takes oil, to manufacture, to ship them. It’s going to take time. I’m 41, I remember people poring oil
9188 2018-08-14 04:17:09 Over 99.5 million: Barrels of #oil the world uses per day in 2018. This is why #solar and #EVs matter #ZeroEmissions #Asthma #GlobalHealth
9189 2018-08-14 04:17:09 Saudi buying #Tesla. The rich will always keep getting richer. If #Trump plays his cards well and oil supports they could help make #California independent!!

9196 2018-08-14 04:16:21 Hahaha. They probably also think we’re harvesting electricity from lightening &not coal fired or gas fired plants. Not as much coming from solar/wind as these nimrods think
Oh & asphalt on roads that comes from oil too, as do multitudes of other products.

Mine? Solid 8-10 hours of sleep the night before. Morning devotional. Eggs and kale for breakfast. Mid-day hour nap. Pre-game QDoba, peppermint essential oil, and half a Red Bull.
9205 2018-08-14 04:14:34 Yes of course. They want their puppets to be in charge where they cant directly control. I feel unless the US ve something in those nations that they can go for like oil & petrol, they wont get involved.
9206 2018-08-14 04:14:30 Facial recognition software could figure it out even with the mask.

9213 2018-08-14 04:13:53 The only problem with Socialism is eventually you run out of other people’s money. 

Even if you are Venezuela, and you are sitting on the largest proven oil reserves in the world. 

And yet they still can’t feed babies, stick medicine or staff dialysis clinics.
9214 2018-08-14 04:13:50 di aku lumayan ngefek sih sis. Ada jerawat baru tak olesin tea tree oil dikit besok paginya udh ilang
9215 2018-08-14 04:13:45 I know, right?  Canada's government may have felt cornered or been played by an oil firm to arrive at such a pathetic and lame decision, but I feel that going ahead with the pipeline purchase is criminal.  Makes no business sense, violates their own promises and the will of many.
9216 2018-08-14 04:13:35 트친이랑 애슐리 와서 선바 얘기만 하고 있다.
9217 2018-08-14 04:13:34 While not impossible it is more likely they see how valuable an investment Tesla is and also an avenue to be energy independent from US price wars for oil. I think people seriously underestimate how tightly US government policy controls the game right now
9218 2018-08-14 04:13:33 コルルはたまに散歩するんだけど、出先で昼寝する。
コルルの集客能力はチートなので、商店街の人たちはコルルを見つけると誘うのだ。うちの植木鉢は寝心地いいぞっと。
そこに特売品の看板を立てて置くと客が集まる…。そして目覚めたコルルはバイト代をもらって帰るのだ
9219 2018-08-14 04:13:32 And aioli involves, you know, olive oil and garlic. Not....mayo. or ketchup.

9223 2018-08-14 04:12:45 Having a car is cool until you have to get an oil change...or an inspection...or tires... or gas.
9224 2018-08-14 04:12:27 You know the answer to this though. Has to do with geopolitical history, strategic positioning, oil, etc. Sorry but the world isn’t perfect.

9229 2018-08-14 04:10:48 Also, two ideologically opposite states of Israel & Pakistan were carved out in 1947/1948 by the British to keep these regions in check against the oil rich Arabs/Persians on one hand, and Russians on the other. History has only proven it right.
9230 2018-08-14 04:10:36 I had tried everything you could think of up until that point: yoga, meditation, CBD oil, essential oils, self help books etc. But healing the deeply rooted mental blocks that were always sabotaging my ability to relax, be free and happy is what truly changed my life.

9233 2018-08-14 04:10:31 .@LastWeekTonight   Saudi Arabia may have suspended diplomatic relations with Canada but are still willing to buy our military equipment and sell us oil, but nothing else. @JustinTrudeau should stop those.
9234 2018-08-14 04:10:29 Do you like coffee for the flavor or the caffeine? If caffeine is recommend Cold brew plus it better on your stomach. If flavor then use all that coconut oil heavy cream and xylitol if you need it sweet a little
9235 2018-08-14 04:10:17 Hey now, we're millennials, we aren't supposed to be productive, lets just start with non olive oil mayo and see how it goes from there.

9244 2018-08-14 04:08:59 I was being sarcastic but if you wanna get rid of it naturally..I suggest using a natural face mask like avocado mask or a citrus facial mask; natural face oil like Jojoba oil, olive oil or pomegranate seed oil. Rub it on at night for treatment. You may need more vitamin C.

9254 2018-08-14 04:08:10 Yes, but you’ll poop right way. It’s better to eat with fiber. Ppl use MCT oil but that’s super concentrated coconut oil. Will make you poop like in 20 minutes LOL
9255 2018-08-14 04:08:07 Oil and gas are more than half, but lots of metals and food. Last year Turkey's huge boom boosted Russian gas exports 28%. Let's see how next quarters unfold.

9267 2018-08-14 04:06:56 The only way we are going create more oil is continue down the current path, because we will become the new matter to decompose over a couple million years.... earth will be fine, she has survived worse... renewables is not about saving planet, it’s about civilisation
9268 2018-08-14 04:06:48 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
9269 2018-08-14 04:06:34 Isn't this what reliance industries has done by moving in phases from the oil industry before it implodes. But rather than buying a startup. They are building Jio from scratch. It's a strong year risky bet.

9281 2018-08-14 04:05:44 Since no one else would do it. I cleaned and mopped the bathroom and kitchen, and cleaned my room and swept it. I also changed my oil in the backing sun. I have a fucking migraine from all of that and not eating or drinking water all day. Time to finally relax. On my day off

9313 2018-08-14 04:00:26 Their oil is such a small % here in Canada as we produce quite a bit ourselves. I would rather get what’s needed from allies. So Trudeau could be in more trouble while most Canadians have his back with SA he needs to do the right thing and cut ALL ties.
9314 2018-08-14 04:00:17 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.

9325 2018-08-14 03:59:10 My Dutch grandfather forged papers for my Russian grandmother to get her out of a refugee camp in Holland and save her from deportation back to Russia. They used those forged papers to come to Canada. He was a geologist for Shell and found a ton of Alberta oil.
9326 2018-08-14 03:58:56 Summer = macaroni salad & potato salad. GOOD ones are not heavy or sweet.  Use a couple dashes of olive oil & a drop of vinegar. And TOSS. Stop The Glop!
9327 2018-08-14 03:58:55 With oil at 73usd/b the results should be at least 50% of Norway (with less oil) if there were not fudge figures. Is there a column for license fees in Scots water to oil companies? Surely should be allocated to Scotland too? With England allocated ITS share from ITS gas fields?
9328 2018-08-14 03:58:51 Heading into Tuesday: U.S. oil inventories probably fell by 2.5m bbls last week, according to a @business survey. Cushing stockpiles probably rose by 500K, a separate forecast showed. That would be the first build for Cushing since May.. #EIA #API #OOTT

Besides that, as long as we're dragging FF out of the ground and selling overseas, it's lunacy we don't use it ourselves.

Yes, we are all for divesting from Big Oil to sustainable generation and use of energy.

What are you advocating?  Using Big Oil money to smear leaders in sustainable technologies and perpetuating dependency on oil?

Shameless.

9346 2018-08-14 03:56:14 'Obviously it does.'

No, it doesn't.

'What is the majority of Venezuela’s economy?'

It isn't oil. Oil accounts for the vast majority of exports, but that's not quite the same thing as the majority of GDP.

I appreciate this would mean Scot had a surplus but it has more oil than Norway so it should be obvious if oil is allocated to Scot that it is going ok.

9368 2018-08-14 03:52:01 It is not. Many Canadians aren't worried if oil company profits are slightly lower.

9383 2018-08-14 03:49:57 'Really, why is that?'

Because of the variable exchange rate introduced by Chavez in 2003 in order to prevent capital flight, which ended up playing into the hands of black marketeers, and because of the fall in world oil prices and Venezuela having been overdependent on oil.

Pardon for pointing the obvious - Elon's "critics", many with ties to Big Oil, are smearing Tesla leadership in transition to sustainable future, while Saudi Fund is leading divesting from Big Oil to sustainable technologies.

It has come to my attention that I may no longer be taking this job seriously
9525 2018-08-14 03:29:09 Is it too much to ask to just be a robot or something? All I gotta worry about is recharging, getting my oil changed and getting a tuneup.

9532 2018-08-14 03:28:00 Redo finished ones in the dry as it soaks through. Get 1/2 cup oil (I used canola) med-high hot in a skillet, drop in chicken carefully. Let fry on one side til edges start looking crispy then flip and cook til tan on the other side. Drain on plate with paper towel. Super easy.

9608 2018-08-14 03:16:52 I should run for President in 2020. I am a Zen Buddhist, and a Socialist. I support open borders, closing the worldwide military bases, bringing the troops home, renewable energy, no fracking, no oil drilling, and no guns. I support free healthcare and free college. Vote for me.
9609 2018-08-14 03:16:44 Hahahaha, very funny. I’m more virginal than most nuns! I’m so virgin, I can work part time in an olive oil factory!
9610 2018-08-14 03:16:43 Saat x-ray barang tiba2 petugas menatap galak, meminta saya membuka bagasi dengan kalimat tegas.
Saya buka lakban kardus, saya keluarkan barang saya yaitu beberapa set crayon oil pastel isi 54 krayon.
Di layar hasil x-ray petugas terlihat seperti selongsongan peluru-peluru.
9611 2018-08-14 03:16:37 This bitch wanted me to remake her sandwich bc i forgot to put oil on it ,, i really do hate my job sometimes lmao
9612 2018-08-14 03:16:25 Let me tell you how some CBD oil will get your insomnia thee fck out of here. 
I slept almost 7 hours last night. 
That being said.. 

9613 2018-08-14 03:16:18 Singh appears to be a walking disaster.  The NDP should shelve him.  First an attack on Québec and Francophones with his Supreme Court comments followed by an attack on oil producing Alberta and the pipeline.  He sure as hell is not an alternative to Trudeau and the Libs.
9614 2018-08-14 03:16:17 Trudeau Stands Firm: As far as human rights issues are concerned, he should not give way to pugnacious Saudi. The oil rich monarchy has been bombing its neighbor unrelentingly killing civilians (women & children) with impunity. Cruel, merciless. What if Riyadh is the victim?
9615 2018-08-14 03:16:10 We can clearly see your bias by photo on your header. Now turn 180’ & focus on the other half of #Colorado. Farmers, ranchers, vineyard/orchard growers, oil/gas/coal workers, resort staff. All constituents deserve to hear #Polis stance on issues! #UrbanElite #COpolitics #COgov
9616 2018-08-14 03:16:09 And the oil companies are not paying us a cent for our oil they extract. And they charge us for our oil. Am ok for charging us for refining but it is still our oil. Shouldn’t we get a tax break on that?
9617 2018-08-14 03:15:59 ゆくゆくはぼある拘束攻撃のMODとか作られると考えると夢が広がるね！！！
9618 2018-08-14 03:15:57 Sec. Diokno: Inflation will taper off in the next quarter and will hover between 2% to 4% next year. The main contributors for current inflation are higher world crude oil prices and higher rice prices.

9626 2018-08-14 03:15:12 Their BCAAs, creatine, theanine, and psyllium are also good quality. Have been meaning to try their greens, but I still prefer fish oil capsules from Costco.
9627 2018-08-14 03:15:08 Uh oh, here come the future regulations that Republicans will decry as hurting businesses or farmers or both, when in reality it's oil companies doing what they've always done: whatever they can get away with.
9628 2018-08-14 03:15:00 @narendramodi rupees at lowest level innovative ideas level economist and finance expert are far away from the ground reality .crude oil taking dollar prices Petro product on high .ministry level supervision resultless and hence rupees condition happen no one is to look after
9629 2018-08-14 03:14:54 @LindaMu70168925  CBD is an oil from the hemp plant (apparently male marijuana plant) it contains no THC (what causes ppl to feel high.) So you get the benefit of the pain relief without feeling high or breaking most laws of most states. CBD is legal in All_ 50 states.
9630 2018-08-14 03:14:49 i'll look into the other products you've recommended for my acne trouble areas (mostly on the bottom half of my face). i don't get acne as much now but i have to deal with acne scars (i heard vit c & tea tree oil serums help)
9631 2018-08-14 03:14:32 Chapter24:Delia @OlatheANMLHLTH 
We found Blue and she had a skin disease so Mark and I treated it with oil from our truck by spreading it on her She had 2 cubs but one is missing. Blue was able to kill a wildebeest that ended up feeding two lions and three hyenas, which was rare
9632 2018-08-14 03:14:31 Wtf “light oil” that makes no sense
9633 2018-08-14 03:14:31 I never watched power. But accountability from males is like oil and water mixing

9636 2018-08-14 03:14:09 ... of the fall in world oil prices and the variable exchange rate mechanism introduced by Chavez in 2003. Nothing to do with 'socialism'.

9642 2018-08-14 03:12:44 My favorite outrage is coming from pro-Israel DC think tankers apparently worried now about Iran loosing out of oil & gas plays in Caspian.

9651 2018-08-14 03:10:55 Here's the thing,  it was publicly known until recently that at least one squater is Albertan. 
Meanwhile,  anti oil groups have been all pissed off about the group from Alberta. 
See what I'm getting at? 
Yes, that's right,  the double standard!  The hypocrisy!
9652 2018-08-14 03:10:46 Quit drillin, ya hit oil
9653 2018-08-14 03:10:43 1) I'm confused. Every metric I look at suggests that Congress (since the passage of the 1970 LRA) is acting decisively in favor of powerful interests. Taxes on the wealthy have plummeted, foreign lobbies make legislator's grovel, big pharma, big sugar, big paper, big oil all win

9676 2018-08-14 03:07:08 We already have subsidies, even the CPC subsidized AB oil big time, we have co-op homes, we have kind of a basic income and even the CPC supports those measures. What the f is your point?

9678 2018-08-14 03:06:51 Aw, thanks. Oil paints are my main thing (my degree and Master’s work are in painting). I’m just playing around with watercolor for the moment.
9679 2018-08-14 03:06:49 Our oil mills are operating under capacity. Its in the organic coco sugar production that farmers have an opportunity. It can be done small scale. A good example is Lao Integrated farm where they get to pay sap gatherers 500 pesos per day due to a huge demand.
9680 2018-08-14 03:06:35 i accidentally used tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner and my scalp is burning cause i'm very allergic to it dumb bitch hours are 24/7! :)
9681 2018-08-14 03:06:29 Today I started cooking with coconut oil.
9682 2018-08-14 03:06:25 There is a dilemma with Middle East oil. It's cheaper to produce than our tar sands:  reducing our domestic consumption by 10% may not eliminate imports from them because they can afford to drop their price in response to lower demand. We might need 20% or more reduction.
9683 2018-08-14 03:06:18 The top of my head reminds me of a thumbprint cookie made with peanut butter cookie dough and drizzled with olive oil and set in the sun

9698 2018-08-14 03:04:12 Does that mean you refuse to fly since Saudi's exclusively use Lockheed and Boieng's planes? Or refuse to Drive since much of the oil is Saudi oil? Where is the ourtage when US govt overtly supports Saudi's for destroying Yeman.

9760 2018-08-14 02:57:29 Considering they are fudging the numbers to meet their narrative has nothing to do with it. Can the oil company's profit off of man made global warming. They have been for decades. You used to pay to have lead put into gas. Then when they came out with unleaded, it was higher $.
9761 2018-08-14 02:57:28 #Venezuela as a member of the OPEC forgot that a long time ago they "played" the world markets with the oil prices.

9781 2018-08-14 02:54:59 So oddly, I like coconut flavor, but not texture. Raw shredded coconut grosses me out, but I love coconut oil. Still, st the end of the day...mango reigns supreme.
9782 2018-08-14 02:54:58 I totally agree we need to get off oil. It’s not going to happen overnight. Alberta should be investing heavily on a dying resource. It can be done. Once we take the money out of it. But it is going to take time.
9783 2018-08-14 02:54:53 Democrats out here getting that oil money but won’t write us a check for gas money.

9798 2018-08-14 02:52:01 I live in Texas. We see the busts and booms of the oil industry up close and personal. There is no boom going on. If the price goes up, it may get better but your statement doesn’t fit the reality in the field. Pretty much like all of trump’s bs. Just isn’t the whole truth.

9803 2018-08-14 02:51:39 Yes I agree. I do feel like everything has been thought of. Refinery, I couldn’t agree more there has to be a reason, I’m sure its money that Canada does not increase refinery. That has to be looked at. But until then let’s sell it, safely. I don’t wanna see oil in coal harbour.
9804 2018-08-14 02:51:34 Many people invested and supported Tesla's vision to move away from fossil fuels. Don't sell to Saudi big oil money. Kinda goes against what Tesla stands for...

9811 2018-08-14 02:50:13 Many people stopped buying conflict diamonds when news of what they were supporting came to the west. Could the same not be done with oil?
9812 2018-08-14 02:50:09 @AFLCIO Do you not know that the Democrats Perez said that no money from coal oil or gas could be accepted and by their members.He retracted last week but all the Democrats are saying they will not support especially with coal.They want the mines closed! U support this

9829 2018-08-14 02:48:27 No. Midwives insisting that they have a different “truth” than obstetricians is like oil CEOs insisting that they have a different “truth” than climate scientists. They can insist all they want, but it merely discredits them.
9830 2018-08-14 02:48:07 Wind turbines are far more destructive to wildlife than oil and gas. Just so you know.
9831 2018-08-14 02:48:00 @realDonaldTrump still has chance, he can stop dealing with them. Why not make America great by taking their oil, destroying them. They turn every country into a terror state, it's so frustrating cause i think Trumps a cool guy.

9836 2018-08-14 02:47:08 I’d also like to see where the market is. Currently we import oil from the Middle East and US, rather than refine our own oil. Doesn’t make sense. That needs to be looked into as well. And finally, all precautionary paperwork and checklists need to be completed, not ignored.

9862 2018-08-14 02:43:51 ISIS are wahhabists. Saudi Arabia are wahhabists. Al Queda are wahhabists. See the pattern? 15/19 attackers on 9/11 were Saudi's which led to the Iraq war. Saudi's untouched, sapped all the oil from the middle east, anyone that doesn't denounce them = elite puppet, shame really.

At times, we put oil in water
Water and oil, can never blend together
Right now is the start, look at me
I’ll turn to fire
And burn furiously

9884 2018-08-14 02:39:15 Ah.. so an oil ‘field’ as well...

Well I hope you get some rest before 4am 

or 

if this is the end of your shift.. 

I hope you recover 
9885 2018-08-14 02:39:10 Your eyes are black oil.
9886 2018-08-14 02:38:58 Sure, not bad. But across the wider emerging market brand recognition of any cartridge or disposable in the BM isn't deep. For much less you can build proprietary. It's not an oil free product like Pax
9887 2018-08-14 02:38:53 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
9888 2018-08-14 02:38:47 nothing will take them away i’ve tried peppermint oil & it only relieves the pain for like an hour
9889 2018-08-14 02:38:46 Should an Oil and Gas producer build their own Gas Processing Plant in today’s environment?

YES - Massive initial capital outlay. Lower OPEX go-forward.

NO - Zero Capital outlay. Ability redeploy capital to other internal  projects. Exposed to higher OPEX go-forward.
9890 2018-08-14 02:38:39 Because the fund is interested in a major hedge.  Tesla is the leading EV company. It's the best way Dollar for Dollar to hedge oil.
9891 2018-08-14 02:38:20 My husband and I do energy work in private on a secret oil pipeline in so east Ontario.  It appears to go from the office bldg directly under a huge Walmart compound which is protected by barbed wire. It's directly across from via-rail line. We wondered why drones fly above us
9892 2018-08-14 02:38:16 I am not familiar with the Irving family but I wonder why the average person would not choose to buy humanely sourced oil products.
9893 2018-08-14 02:37:38 I subscribe to ritual vitamins and I take a spoonful of black seed oil.

9896 2018-08-14 02:37:22 It's hilarious that I only ever see that "this account looks automated" trope applied to accounts that are very obviously not automated. But if the account is pro-Trump, you can bet that site will flag it. Try it on me & post results! Now, I need electricity and oil.
9897 2018-08-14 02:37:06 i need my oil changed and two new tires 
9898 2018-08-14 02:36:33 Curious if anyone on this thread has tried CBD oil.  I have heard it really helps with anxiety, I am currently giving it a shot.
9899 2018-08-14 02:36:16 มาคุยกันนนน
9900 2018-08-14 02:36:11 I usually make: romaine, grape tomato, red onion, orange bell pepper, avocado, hard boiled egg, and chia seeds with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Sometimes with strawberries or dried cranberries.
9901 2018-08-14 02:36:04 @suzuki2wheelers  Hey there I have my lovely suzuki gixxer sf sp I want to know that what is the tyre air pressure in gixxer sf and in how many kilometer I should change my oil filter please suggest.
9902 2018-08-14 02:35:56 The reason we have Fortnite is because we have oil.

9904 2018-08-14 02:35:20 Iran is selling oil and gas at a discount to Asian customers as it prepares for the return of US sanctions, state news agency IRNA reported on Monday.
9905 2018-08-14 02:35:17 I work for a waste management company in the oil and gas industry.

9908 2018-08-14 02:33:56 "I like the sound of that! But first I need to make sure that I'm giving you the proper treatment and care you need at the moment." Zero soon pulled out an oil which is supposed to be massaged into the body so that it can help relieve soreness quickly. He removed the towels ++

9914 2018-08-14 02:33:27 I just want someone daughter to massage me every night with some coconut oil 
9915 2018-08-14 02:33:15 บางทีก็เหนื่อยที่ต้องมารับรู้ปัญหาเดิมๆซ้ำๆของคนอื่น...คือเราก็มีนะ แต่กลับมาคิดอีกทีคนนั้นอาจจะไม่มีใครรับฟังหรือช่วยแก้อยู่ก็ได้
9916 2018-08-14 02:33:14 I am sorry, I guess! But avocados taste like oil to me. Is it just me?
9917 2018-08-14 02:33:11 I understand your concern, but the truth is the Saudis are just being smart. They know clean energy is the future, that's why they are trying everything they can to ditch their dependency on oil. Just look at all the new plans within their country and you'll know
9918 2018-08-14 02:33:03 Maybe oil on road in front of gate, just rained, speed
9919 2018-08-14 02:32:58 I sleep so much better when I have peppermint oil rubbed into my head

9921 2018-08-14 02:32:30 I'm curious @SecretaryZinke. Were you always a Jody or is this a trait you developed recently?

I served and it wasn't too get energy and make oil companies richer you putz. It's that why you joined up. To be a petroleum companies bitch.

9923 2018-08-14 02:32:24 No. We do not need oil.

9926 2018-08-14 02:32:02 And we need to get out of the Saudies bed and stop buying oil from these killers!  Mighty is the dollar that allows the U.S. to continue close relationships with evil!
9927 2018-08-14 02:31:27 I used to but goodness gracious id hv to find the time to do it & some more.  But tysm I will get some rosemary and olive oil to make the paste. I keep garlic cloves.  But I don't cook like that anymore. I will hv to drive all the way to u and eat!

9930 2018-08-14 02:31:14 As US investigation of both Obama and the Clintons proceed it takes little imagination to see why Trudeau earlier gave so many Canadian millions to, separately, Obama and the Clintons! Play in a cesspool, you’re bound to stink! Oil pimp eh!

9933 2018-08-14 02:30:56 Depends on what it is I guess. There's an etsy seller who makes essential oil scents, she has CR ones and I really love them. I know CR is never gonna have fragrances in their shop so. I also like some of the fanart shirts on RedBubble (etc) because they support the artist too.
9934 2018-08-14 02:30:53 I see why y’all was so obsessed with coconut oil
9935 2018-08-14 02:30:51 I mean, the emulsion of oil and vinegar is a perfect representation of the assimilationist impulses of the 20th century America that took dozens of immigrant cultures and created a single homogeneous whiteness? Can you write this kind of thing and mean it? If so, who are you?
9936 2018-08-14 02:30:40 so I just slipped on olive oil my sister spilt on the floor and I think I broke my butt

9942 2018-08-14 02:30:16 China has a long term strategy to be the dominant global power, at the expense of American economic prosperity.  Who cares about Russia?  Pres Ragan bankrupted the Soviets with an arms race communists could not win + Pres Trump is bankrupting Russia by taking over oil markets.
9943 2018-08-14 02:30:15 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
9944 2018-08-14 02:30:14 I just realised tanks in GTA V can leak oil like any other vehicle. Lighting those lines is greatly satisfying.

9948 2018-08-14 02:29:56 As a WI resident, I can tell you that we HATE this “deal” for reasons not only economic, but environmental as well. It is a joke product of a clown president and a snake oil salesman of a governor.

If I don’t survive, tell my family I love them.

9956 2018-08-14 02:29:05 For sure, this is why our corrupt politicians that are bought with foreign money block any attempt at oil independence until they can control it.
9957 2018-08-14 02:28:48 Today nick + I were both getting our oil changed at the same time (unknowingly until it was happening), were both in the mood for Taco Bell, & both pulled out the same first taco and put the same sauce on top without knowing what the other was doing. I think we are becoming one.
9958 2018-08-14 02:28:46 I asked a simple question.

I apologize if FA article angered you, if i'd noticed it were max boot, i'd have found diff; source

but fact is that 1990s were a decade of UN abuses that included at 1 genocide, 1 major massacre, 1000s of war crimes in Africa, and oil-for-food scam
9959 2018-08-14 02:28:24 We can't eat or drink oil. Yet these oil men don't care even as they will watch their children and their grand children run out of clean water.

9965 2018-08-14 02:27:17 This past week has been such a struggle for me emotionally I don’t know what to do 
9966 2018-08-14 02:27:14 Let's get every premier east of Alberta on side. Let's stop blood oil from coming into Canada.
9967 2018-08-14 02:26:56 Jab tak hai Jaan. This has nothing to do with our domestic problems. It is a global sell-off. We import 70% of our oil. We have to pay somewhere
9968 2018-08-14 02:26:50 In the past two days of my break from school I’ve changed my own oil, brake rotors, and brake pads. My mechanic’s daughter is showing....
9969 2018-08-14 02:26:45 
9970 2018-08-14 02:26:44 Try coconut oil in the bath or general use.  Dandelion oil has may uses too.
9971 2018-08-14 02:26:37 bem... se elas tão dizendo né....
(eu achava que azeite de oliva não servia pra oil cleansing)
9972 2018-08-14 02:26:33 And it becomes over determined if we add in the “global commerce” dimension.  James Baker famously gave a one word response for why the US was involved in the ME and Persian Gulf: “Oil”

9974 2018-08-14 02:26:20 I do it every morning. At night I sometimes use just the jojoba oil on my face and go to sleep. Also do facial masks every Monday. What is your issue with your skin?

9977 2018-08-14 02:25:52 Aw geez, pup! What was wrong with the cake? Did your human get you a bad cake? My mom used to make cake with flax seeds and olive oil, so I understand

9980 2018-08-14 02:25:32 From what I remember, it is not ingested, they are oils and lotions.  There is no THC in the oil and ointments.  The statement above is misleading.
9981 2018-08-14 02:25:26 Who needs fans when have brown dinosaur bones ? So no more subsidies for oil companies? Yeah ok
9982 2018-08-14 02:25:23 Is this like when you said the Saudi Prince was lowering oil prices because of your call, only to have him come out the next day saying he never spoke to you?
9983 2018-08-14 02:25:21 Somebody should have put some oil in that chocolate fountain. That thing was sad.
9984 2018-08-14 02:25:20 Also just a bit weird that a leading oil klepto state is reportedly interested in staking him. Wasn't his whole mission to reduce carbon fuel dependence?

9995 2018-08-14 02:23:28 YES!! Love my oil diffuser! Just be careful with what oils you’re using since they help with certain moods & what not. To help keep kids calm and focused, I use lavender & peppemint. I bought a bigger one off amazing for $20, so worth it!
9996 2018-08-14 02:23:12 Seriously.
I had some Thai sardines this afternoon for lunch, the best tasting ones were in soybean oil.
Soy is great, a perfect bumper crop that replenishes the soil, a super-oxygenator for air quality, and you can use the yield for so many things.

10001 2018-08-14 02:22:36 Then you know. Point is we still have product we need to sell. I mean, I guess we could just leave it in the ground and let it continue to seep like it was before big bad oil went in to clean it up. Going green will happen but It's not time yet...

10006 2018-08-14 02:22:02 It was so insane they nerfed blade fury to pathetic tier in response. I really miss it. It was probably bad for the game but oil was a blast to pilot. 

So difficult to master but once you did...
10007 2018-08-14 02:21:54 Exfoliating with scrubs creates microscopic cuts in skin that allow bacteria to sink in, try exfoliating with warm water, clean hands, and your favorite plant oil instead (its cheaper and your skin will thank you!)
10008 2018-08-14 02:21:43 He thought he was taking heat for suggesting we stop buying Saudi oil?
10009 2018-08-14 02:21:34 Get real -Take them damn blinders off. Best on the street. M doesn’t care, got no skin in the game he’s a mouthpiece for the man. Big oil Trumps little oil. Fun times. When the prince rented the whole four seasons down the street I called it (as if he was going to Apple)
