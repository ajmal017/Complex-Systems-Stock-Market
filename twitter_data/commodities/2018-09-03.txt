39 2018-09-03 22:35:53 Status quo politicians need to examine FDR’s career, observing the force of mass solidarity that followed in it’s wake: workers earning livable wages, commodities manufacturing and exchange, families andneighborhoods built on equitable economic conditions. A Left Wave is coming.

41 2018-09-03 22:23:55 Although a fair assessment, formally it is rather the other way around. Debt built up huge price value for financial assets, collaterals being tax, mortgages, commodities, etc whose payments are mostly owed by middle classes

43 2018-09-03 22:13:06 What's the main channel then? 

To my eyes the biggest factor w anything Australia, housing boom or commodities sales, is China. And they'll depreciate their currency to make commodities/exporters to China do better as housing crashes.. But Chinese investments will die in process

Put simply, when you make Markets the sole expression and methodology of a society, you make the people into mere commodities. Things. Property.
55 2018-09-03 21:18:53 Hay que tener presente que además del campo minado que le dejaron con toda saña, las tiene todas en contra: mundo en recesión, tasas en alza, commodities por el suelo, etc. Eso no lo exime de sus errores, que los tiene, pero convengamos que le toca bailar con la más fea.

58 2018-09-03 21:08:21 The factors that preceded the 1890s crash have some (not all) parallels with today.  Huge commodities boom, followed by high immigration and large infrastructure boom.  Melbourne was ground zero.  Just some history - I have no idea whether this downturn will be prolonged or not.

90 2018-09-03 19:01:42 Acá tuvimos una mala gestión macroeconómica que nos llevó a un déficit de cuenta corriente creciente desde 2010, con creciente atraso cambiario, en medio de un contexto internacional sumamente favorable, con los commodities en máximos y las tasas de interés FED en mínimos.
91 2018-09-03 19:00:43 Can't even manage it's airline while in the meantime basic commodities are going up and the fake bond note is losing value eish you're an EDiot whose ambitions and greed know no bounds...mxm
92 2018-09-03 18:59:33 It's now that the government is focusing on settling the debts by hiking prices of basic commodities for the citizens. The call for unnecessary borrowing was made much earlier, all these anticipated. 
They know who to go for. Spare us, we never participated in the looting spree
93 2018-09-03 18:47:47 True, I support your statement.. Although technology keep improving and news commodities like bitcoin, are being introduced in the financial market, cash will circulate in the economy, the demand for banknotes keep increasing every year in Africa... So cash is still a need

98 2018-09-03 18:28:16 Is it better to tax them to pay allowances to 'mp igs' who have no Kenya at heart? That parliament stinks...did he pocket 10k to kill Kenyans? Where do their families buy commodities ie sugar. Nkt!
99 2018-09-03 18:21:43 It's about the state all political parties it's the normal public who is suffering because of high price in the fuel and other essential commodities which also increase based on fuel prices. And why govt is taking such a long time to link with get.
100 2018-09-03 18:10:58 Eso es cierto. En el modelo capitalista, el único posible en este momento del planeta, elevar de esa forma el gasto público es una locura, especialmente para un país que aún depende tanto de commodities y prod. agrícolas

103 2018-09-03 18:02:41 What am I hearing?
I hear there are shortages of commodities such as fuel, plastic drinks & cerevita. Meanwhile, they are printing more bond notes which have flooded the market. On the other hand, prices are shooting up. What am I hearing? What happened to the mega deals?

122 2018-09-03 16:51:21 A su vez, tenemos otro problema y es que en uy tiene que ingresar plata por el tipo de economía que tenemos y el tipo de productos que producimos. Al estar bajos los commodities del agro y, tener varios rubros fundidos. Cualquier inyección de capitales hay que mirarla con cariño.

124 2018-09-03 16:44:52 Will petrol and diesel price cross RS 100 till 2019? Government should control the price rise of diesel and petrol.This will affect coming parliamentary election##essential commodities price would be high##and poor people#face great problem##
125 2018-09-03 16:44:18 Petrol hike directly or indirectly affects all the major sectors like transportation, textiles, auto, FMCG etc, for manufacturing & transportation. This affects the prices of daily essential commodities which are transported on a daily basis.

126 2018-09-03 16:37:31 Virgin production iron, aluminum, & chloralkali chemistry, consumes massive amount of energy, many times energy to recycle same materials, eg 10x for virgin aluminum, so renewable wind power in the Falklands can export absolutely essential fossil fuel neutral commodities to UK.
127 2018-09-03 16:37:13 Trolling aside, this price rise doesn't seem to be because of demand. And your point is valid, with increasing interest rates the real wages should be static or may be immaterial due to rising prices of ' tariffed' commodities.
128 2018-09-03 16:36:22 GDP nos might be encouraging but what about the increasing oil prices,. falling rupees and soaring prices of commodities & consumables.... are we going to live and eat nos..
129 2018-09-03 16:32:50 It’s a big problem and in Some months there will be shortage of commodities
130 2018-09-03 16:30:16 The primary reason for  #FOCAC2018 and other alternatives from the West is to avoid this conditional lending by US based IMF and World Bank that has led us to this 16% VAT on basic commodities. Too much for Western benevolence..
131 2018-09-03 16:25:21 Hard to find people who aren't looking at me, my loves in life, my principles as commodities for sale these days.
132 2018-09-03 16:24:45 #86TooMuch 
High fuel price would have direct impact on price rise in all essential commodities specially for NE region ,by the way middle class people are going to be harrashed,.

134 2018-09-03 16:19:24 Buenas tardes,
Qué pasaría si hay una baja de los commodities que exporta Argentina?

Los números están calculados para cubrir una contingencia de este tipo?
135 2018-09-03 16:18:10 Shared values are reinforced at funerals, when assessing a human life.  Politics are about both shared values AND actual shared commodities (like resources from taxes).  If some Repubs don't SHARE values like honesty, integrity, humility, generosity, they might feel attacked.
136 2018-09-03 16:17:55 2.2 Do we understand the D/B pricing commodities and paying for the commodities? DAB should clarify to the public and even to the govt.
137 2018-09-03 16:17:01 Tener en cuenta que no todos son commodities, están la especialidades como arvejas, Porotos, lentejas, garbanzo etc en donde hace unos días se les quitaron los reintegros, con la devaluación se evaporó el IVA retenido y ahora no tengo claro el % pero también se le suman retencion
138 2018-09-03 16:13:44 #86TooMuch  The worry is that fuel price increase is directly inflationary and will have a cascading effect on the prices of all essential commodities - is the Govt blind to all his pain??
139 2018-09-03 16:12:01 Moral of demand verses supply (price), to increase price of those commodities, which are more demanding, is part of fiscal, will not hurt economy not Bjp.
140 2018-09-03 16:09:44 Agree.  The trends show real wages basically stagnant since early 70s, and with less guarantees.  Workers are commodities.
141 2018-09-03 16:08:33 Who manages the commodities price better
142 2018-09-03 16:08:14 Australia completely strung out on commodities profits.  Gonna be a rough morning after.
143 2018-09-03 16:06:54 Do you guys ever do any analysis of opposition parties or generaly anything that is not related to ZNP and ED? E.g food security studies or why there are price hikes on basic commodities and wat is influencing these trends?? 

Im just curious!
144 2018-09-03 16:06:36 Who manages the commodities price better??
145 2018-09-03 16:02:15 Our PM should not stop making incorrect statements and concentrate on the main issue of high price of essential commodities and petroleum products. Our PM should stop blaming opposition everytime. Now it is now 54months of this BJP govts. BJP govt failed on fronts. Only jumlabaji
146 2018-09-03 16:00:28 Entiendo y esa es la lógica que se impone, pero es una lógica perversa. Podrían ellos crecer si se adaptan. Si no lo hacen, además, han de perecer pronto. Sus commodities cada vez se pagan peor y son vulnerables al cambio climático, exprimir un Estado raquítico ya no es negocio.
147 2018-09-03 15:59:39 Panama igual no exporta commodities sino que es receptor de capital. Internamente no se produce nada, todo importado, para ellos dolarizar tiene sentido. Ecuador fijate que logro controlar su inflacion despues de dolarizar, pero nunca mas tuvo PIB de mas de 2%
148 2018-09-03 15:54:35 You could not be more wrong.  NAFTA provided stability. A steady import and export stream. Electricity and oil will be the next commodities hit with tariffs. Not enough electricity to operate plants during the day.

Only thing going down is Republic ratings.

154 2018-09-03 15:42:44 The book biscusses in detail business cycle and commodity sensitive stock models.

155 2018-09-03 15:42:22 If , central taxes are reduced, fiscal deficit would widen & inflation increases. A guy on TW would be better off spending Rs 100 extra per month than pay 100s of rupees on Dal, rice and essential commodities. This is my personal opinion and not a blind support to @narendramodi .

163 2018-09-03 15:26:37 Draft capital is assets that can be turned into other assets. Also, they are the only way to acquire low cost high return value on the field.

Established players are not as known of commodities as you think either. Injury, decline of play, and not fitting a team are applicable.
164 2018-09-03 15:22:32 The #prices of general commodities, particularly of those that are required every day by all most all people(say food & grocery items) should not increase in future.@GovtOfIndia_ may think to run fair-price shops, using unemployed youths.
165 2018-09-03 15:21:06 China controls Both demand and supply in some commodities  like steel,  it's difficult to take a call since China can cut supply to keep prices afloat
166 2018-09-03 15:20:19 Not having $15 Min wage means we still have small businesses in this country. If you had that min wage, the prices on all commodities will at least double, more than negating the value of said minimum wage.

Do you even understand the concept of how economics works?

168 2018-09-03 15:18:16 If only we had no elections, nothing could have rattled the prices of basic commodities. Today, I took my 2 daughters back to school.

This way prices of commodities will remain under control otherwise with higher fuel prices inflation would be another major worry for the govt. along with rising dollar and other factors which
171 2018-09-03 15:11:10 Shameful to say so. You are reaping almost every single cents from your investments and taking it back to China without any expenses here. Everything you use is from China, why not buy the local commodities if you are here to assist
172 2018-09-03 15:09:08 Is it a statement about the open market commodities traded on the casting couch?
173 2018-09-03 15:09:06 Interesting chart. Question though aren’t commodities such as NG and CL inverse of dollar, ie dollar down they go up?
174 2018-09-03 15:08:54 Showing off their glittering surfaces, these commodities cast a powerful spell over the city and alter even the most resistant consciousness, reversing the sense of what really matters, what is truly valuable, turning what is less into more, what is more into less. - D.

It's nearly worthless.
183 2018-09-03 14:51:12 Shocking as it may sound, neither fishing trawlers, nor vegetable-laden tempos, or trucks/ trains carrying milk & essential commodities run on air - they all need fuel. And higher costs get transferred down the chain to the consumer, ie, the common man.

Do you want me to go on?

205 2018-09-03 13:59:35 The high prices of basic commodities is the reflection of backward thinking and incompetence of Duterte administration.
206 2018-09-03 13:52:56 El aceite y la harina de soja deberían pagar $ 4 / US$ como el poroto. Es una transformación mínima, inicial, sin marca. Por eso en las estadísticas mundiales de comercio internacional están contabilizadas como commodities agropecuarios. No son agroalimentos con valor agregado.
207 2018-09-03 13:51:35 Si bajan los commodities... no, attenti con esto.
208 2018-09-03 13:46:50 1)Agree 100%. Commodities can only go so far. And yes, time will tell if they can be trusted to run the country. Sadly, until then, I can't vote for them. I actually can't vote for any of them. ANC have too much corrupt baggage and DA just keep race baiting.
209 2018-09-03 13:37:47 Hon. Murkomen will it be possible for that amendment bill to be signed by the president and yet it has been implemented,now 16% on VAT on petroleum has been taxed leading to increased prices of commodities?

227 2018-09-03 12:36:59 I agree with Swamy why all govts minting money from Petroleum products. On one side Petrol Diesel are essential commodities, on the other side Gvt both Centre and states levying extra ordinary tax on these items. Both gvts Shud reduce tax by 8-10 rupees each. @ShekharGupta
228 2018-09-03 12:35:26 But it increases prison population and this creates nearly free labour and also means that someone can profit off of privatised prisons. Just means that the convicted are essentially commodities.
229 2018-09-03 12:30:21 I've been hearing news about the rising costs of basic food commodities, so I wasn't supposed to be shocked when I hit the market today. But my gulay! P55 for a small bundle of kangkong?! Eh P5 (P10 at most) lang yan last time a!
230 2018-09-03 12:29:18 Never seen a state so hell bent on killing the its own people to survive. First it destroys their houses then their sources of livelihood. When they barely have anything, it legislates to impose heavy taxes on mainstay commodities. Tukifa, nani atatembelea hizo barabara na reli?
231 2018-09-03 12:28:15 With this kind of economy, we end up breeding thieves, fraudsters, Masqueraders name them.... A Government that hikes prices on commodities and services with zero creation of job opportunities to it's citizens and still expect them to pay taxes. Such is a failed government.

240 2018-09-03 11:56:18 This is false.  Though unemployment is at its lowest, wages are stagnant and rise of gas prices and other commodities means that people are bringing less home. With tariffs in place people will pay even more out of pocket.

245 2018-09-03 11:48:38 Alternatively, we could stop breeding pigs just to kill them. Then these poor "farmers" wouldn't be out all that money... and the thousands+ pigs would never have been born to be treated as commodities. 
I'll always be sad to hear of such deaths.
246 2018-09-03 11:46:45 A hike in fuel prices has a direct impact on almost all basic commodities. The introduction of this 16% may not necessarily be reterogrssive but the effect is pretty too much of possible pressure to mwananchi’s already over-strained budget #PunguzaBeiYaMafuta

249 2018-09-03 11:33:14 Customers have nothing to buy w no workers or land "free" to produce those commodities.  Mkt devel requires people to be "freed" socially and personally from independent ctrl of wealth, so that they must meet their needs through commodity exchange. Thus: tax, debt and enclosure.

255 2018-09-03 10:51:17 According to @DOHgovph, budget for FP commodities is 342 million in 2018 and 114 million in 2019. This is because we still have  around 700 million FP commodities.

277 2018-09-03 09:19:18 We do not use oil, gas or electricity as commodities. We use heat/cooling, light, power etc as a service. Commodities are limited by secular decline in EROEI, while capital intensity drives switch to smart (capital lite) services. Game is changing completely

295 2018-09-03 08:25:32 The reality of September 1st I've been talking about is here with us--expect price rises for almost all basic commodities. Expect Treasury to tell you that no inflation as a result. It's time to tighten belts (also wait out for all sorts of socio-economic crime surge)

312 2018-09-03 06:56:46 This 16% VAT tax on fuel will increase the cost of producing goods in Kenya leading to higher prices, business people will prefer importing foreign commodities hence weakening our industries. This hike tax is unacceptable CC @HKRotich @UKenyatta

358 2018-09-03 03:48:06 But if it isn't rare, it's even less likely for its price to rise. Commodities are bad plays in general. Productive assets are where to put your money.
359 2018-09-03 03:48:02 @PCRM is an association of clinicians & scientists who endorse veganism for the reasons I cited. Raising sentient animals to be used as commodities is morally repulsive to me even if the gross brutality of factory farming is not seen on this particular video.

364 2018-09-03 03:30:23 Wow ... that’s a bold prediction. 
Given they export commodities if the cycle stalls could see it go there faster.
365 2018-09-03 03:23:00 In agreement with you, kind of curious and surprised to know that even so called Journalists are debating not only on stocks but also on future, commodities and so on. They tries to show that they are experts on every topic ranging from Economics, Politics, National Security etc.
366 2018-09-03 03:21:46 I looked this up last time it was posted
The conversion rate is 
1$ then / $17 now

Many things have stayed comprable after adjustment

Some of the food commodities such as milk have gotten cheaper though

Housing as always is location-based
367 2018-09-03 03:20:09 Basic commodities are now getting more pricey. My fave juice box went from PHP 8.00 to PHP 8.25. Inflation rates are getting worse. 

What the fuck is going on?!

373 2018-09-03 03:02:39 Por la estrategia de diversificar la “matriz productiva”. Un componente clave en esto es la salida de empresas del país (incluyendo ensambladoras, entró otras, por un clima empresarial hostil), aumento significativo de dependencia en commodities (especialmente petróleo), etc etc.
374 2018-09-03 03:00:31 Tremendo. A rezar por un cosechón, y si es por pedir, que los commodities que vendemos afuera levanten precio, caso contrario.... we’re totally fucked....
375 2018-09-03 02:57:07 Se llaman commodities, y así y todo fue uno de los dos gobiernos junto con Peron que tuvieron superavit en los ult 70 años. Andá a tomá' la sopa.
376 2018-09-03 02:55:21 Well.....everything changed after that....rule changes at the CME over the years...led to huge gobs of investment capital come into commodities, a wider river, computer trading, bigger liquidity.....and now Trump
377 2018-09-03 02:46:03 Did you know?
USDA's $12 billion relief package would be targeted to farm commodity sectors most impacted by retaliatory tariffs. Those commodities include: soybeans, corn, cotton, hogs, sorghum and dairy.

379 2018-09-03 02:21:22 Where do you get this lies you people? The basic commodities are going up daily do what do you mean improving when things are getting tough on the ground everyday
380 2018-09-03 02:15:51 The ruling class of Kenya is deeply embedded in business,when commodities prices go high,its the businessman who benefits #16%fuelprice.
381 2018-09-03 02:00:00 What’s in store for commodities this year?
382 2018-09-03 01:48:22 @dzbb
@joelzobel halos araw2 na lang nagtulakan ang DA at DTI kung sino ang in charge sa monitoring and controlling prices of commodities...di ba dapat DTI? sila ang nangangasiwa sa lahat ng bagay in relation to businesses and trades; including agricultural products.
383 2018-09-03 01:47:09 No discipline on uncontrolled fuel prize , plunging of Rupee vs Dollar and inflation on daily usable commodities; no discipline on mob lynching and cow vigilantes : Only disciplined in imposing the ban on oppositions and any voice on dissent .
384 2018-09-03 01:32:56 It is sad to learn that there are real ‘ Black sheep ‘ among the Afro Americans who had sold themselves like commodities and argue  against the  interests of their own community at large !
385 2018-09-03 01:26:18 Smuggling of vital commodities should be classified as a capital crime with severe punishment. It deprives the people of taxes and duties owed them and it harms local producers who are denied a fair price that is caused by a deliberately distorted market.
386 2018-09-03 01:25:16 Prices up 25% for commodities and building supplies. We sold off all our US assets and have stepped away from that market. So no lie buddy.  We will buy back in at a discount when 45 is gone.
387 2018-09-03 01:24:17 Engraçado que essas commodities só passaram a existir nos tempos do governo Lula! Antes isso não existia pelo visto! O boom era doar o patrimônio do país ao capital financeiro e se ajoelhar ao famigerado FMI que ditava as regras aqui nesse país de desmiolados! É muita cara de pau

389 2018-09-03 01:20:57 RJ arrecadou muitos recursos com os royalties do Oil, só que acharam que seria pra sempre e aumentaram as despesas obrigatórias esquecendo do ciclo das commodities. Quando a maré da bonança baixou, RJ estava de calça curta.
390 2018-09-03 01:06:44 You’re mad the lions didn’t put all those commodities into Mack when we are the 6th oldest team in the nfl and are clearly building on Quinn’s young rookie crop to push this team forward. Thank god im not.
391 2018-09-03 00:59:03 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
392 2018-09-03 00:53:36 Old joke: how does one make a small fortune in the commodities markets?

Start with a large one.
393 2018-09-03 00:52:47 You've missed my point....yes new trade deals need made and yes US ag commodities were going to suffer but I'm not a believer that TradeAid is anything more than a plot to ensure the GOP keeps control of congress.
394 2018-09-03 00:47:10 "Space is real in the same sense that commodities are real since (social) space is a (social) product."

395 2018-09-03 00:04:46 And they're even wrong when it comes to selling commodities. What people *say* they like isn't always what they'll buy. Often they'll say what they think they're *supposed* to say, which is another reason why this whole "consumer movement" schtick is a bad idea.
396 2018-09-03 00:04:30 All I have to do is say four letters to trigger you. FYI I traveled to nyc a few years ago to meet up with a filmmaker who had filmed Oregon farms to discuss how Farm images conveyed in film, all sizes was the approach we were taking. And, in other commodities as well.
