THAT IS A FACT

9 2018-04-12 23:58:28 Oil defenders claim: if demand unchanged -> production shifts elsewhere = no net reduction in emissions.
but wouldn't it be: production shifts to somewhere more expensive to extract -> price goes up = demand goes down/emissions decrease

Why he is now calling out POTUS about tariffs that will impact the ports of Sav/Bruns
13 2018-04-12 23:58:04 Congratulations to NZ for making the important step to ban offshore Oil & Gas drilling. The enviro impact to both the oceans and the climate can no longer be ignored. We need the same here, to protect the Great Aust Bight!

Syria: Iran has lots of oil, and the best way to move it westwards, is in a pipeline through Syria. Zio-US and UK  want to lay waste to Iran and Syria, then take their oil. They really don't care about ordinary people,Syrian or their own.

145 2018-04-12 23:48:50 One of my favorite veggies! Especially oven roasted with olive oil, salt and pepper! Yum!
146 2018-04-12 23:48:36 I haven't bought PB ever. My mom makes it and it's pure peanuts no extra oil or anything. I'm peanut butter spoiled.
147 2018-04-12 23:48:31 That's exactly the issue. I'm dealing with now. Eczema but when I use vaseline or coconut oil to combat she rashes from those.
148 2018-04-12 23:48:29 In oil money? Yes. In everything else? Fuck no
149 2018-04-12 23:48:28 Waste to energy plants are pretty impressive.  The problem with counting on recycling is that only 3% or some ridiculously low number is actually recycled, so we ship it off and it's some other country's problem.  We can think of plastics as an intermediate stage in oil to energy
150 2018-04-12 23:48:22 “You people” lol.  Do you live outside, without clothes, food, heat or any possessions? What device did you use to make this comment?  A stone tablet & chisel?  I am sorry to say but you are also part of “You people”.  Your life depends on oil just as much as mine. Lol.
151 2018-04-12 23:48:15 I remember reading in an international business publication a few years back that spoke to this issue as biggest risk to Canada’s oil industry. Didn’t fully understand it then but it seems like it’s in everyone’s interest to clarify this because it would seem to affect everything
152 2018-04-12 23:48:13 Apparently hand oil is bad for metallic objects but not necessarily paper ones...
153 2018-04-12 23:48:09 so, maybe for diesel.. diesel also lubricates the engine. But as far as gas, so when your car sits all the oil goes to the bottom of the engine. Letting it run for a few mins before you drive it will give the oil pump time to get the oil up to the top of the engine cam, lifters..
154 2018-04-12 23:48:09 @GreenQuran world knows assad has been doing that for months. But world has turned a blind eye allowing civilians to be killed

158 2018-04-12 23:47:57 wei smlm aku beli aiken tea tree oil . rm14 asal kau punya 17
159 2018-04-12 23:47:44 Yes, it's the military industrial complex, oil prospectors (such as Genie which has an interest in the Syrian Golan Heights), and US allies Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey who want war. Trump is just the psychopath figurehead who regurgitates the R2P protocols as justification.
160 2018-04-12 23:47:37 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

165 2018-04-12 23:46:35 Psalm 23:5: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
166 2018-04-12 23:46:32 No!
167 2018-04-12 23:46:03 Buckets of oil for everyone! 
168 2018-04-12 23:46:02 And some people don't know how to use tools at all.   Just because I can change oil at the Jiffy Lube, doesn't mean I'm ready for F1.
169 2018-04-12 23:46:00 If I’m working past 5:30 PM, I consider it “burning the midnight oil”

174 2018-04-12 23:45:28 That would be like you buying oil everyday because your engine leaks oil and you can't afford to take your car in. At some point you're spending more on oil than the repair would have cost, plus the cost of damage due to inadequate oil in your engine. Same with dental and Rx.
175 2018-04-12 23:45:22 Rosemary essential oil is the heckin tatas boi
176 2018-04-12 23:45:14 Ontario is very happy to receive equalization payments, and British Columbia still wants cheap gas… Why should Alberta and Saskatchewan give $$$ to these provinces who don’t want the “dirty oil“ crossing their land?
177 2018-04-12 23:45:03 Gas prices is going to continue to rise, because OPEC is the most stingiest people in the world! We need to get our oil in the USA . That will Send them a message
178 2018-04-12 23:44:54 No, the premise seems interesting, but it doesn't make sense. It's slow and depressing.
179 2018-04-12 23:44:35 Lettuce, radish, spinach, cheese tomato vinegar and oil 
180 2018-04-12 23:44:33 The contract has been awarded to clean up the Manolis L - @CarolynRParsons gives us the details. $15.1M to clean up 130,000 L of oil. Wow!
181 2018-04-12 23:44:28 @cadoges hello! quick q, when checking for oil levels, what is the best way? When I check mine, it's usually cold, never thought about it otherwise. Now I find out my manual states "wait approx 3m after turning off the engine." should I follow the manual? the car uses 0W-20
182 2018-04-12 23:44:26 sorry i cant come im trapped in an oil painting
183 2018-04-12 23:44:23 Yea lol. Honey really good for the skin . I put tea tree oil in my baths a lot & coconut as lotion .
184 2018-04-12 23:44:22 So Trump wages a full on war with Human Trafficking in the USA and all of the sudden we get a chem attack in Syria, the oil war started by the same billionaires who are affected by the shutdown of #BackPage

186 2018-04-12 23:44:12 Western Canada bitumen fetches the infamous “discount” price per barrel compared to oil supplies shipped from Texas and the North Sea. The LOOP terminal for VLCCs will magnify that spread, and no mythical Asian refiner, trader, or nation is likely to purchase a dirtier product
187 2018-04-12 23:43:51 What a day... What a gosh dang day... How you gonna take your car to get an oil change and they don't put the oil plug back on?

193 2018-04-12 23:43:08 Kumba-Ekombe road as well as all arteries leading into Ndian division seems blocked allegedly by Unspecified armed groups. I also gathered, Oil tankers transporting oil palm from Pamol are blocked & others reportedly burst, leading spillage
194 2018-04-12 23:43:00 It's time to oil up
195 2018-04-12 23:42:45 Well the oil companies are the major cause of global warming! So what is this passive aggressive bs?  As for loving ‘taking SUVs to the gym’ it’s a ridiculous statement as a preamble to your point. Deconstructing it yields an ignorant ad writer.
196 2018-04-12 23:42:42 When the sun is out...grab your board... your bible...and go have a 4 hour skate session lol...

Good session boys! Tyler Barnett Tyler Denkenberger
197 2018-04-12 23:42:38 Happy game 1 day my dudes I'm burning some Empowering essential oil and rocking the red let's get it
198 2018-04-12 23:42:36 It's embarrassing that @GovMaryFallin and local oil businesses decided that teacher raises amount to hush money. #okleg
199 2018-04-12 23:42:35 なるほどw
200 2018-04-12 23:42:09 @jjhorgan Mr Horgan. Enough with blocking the KM pipeline. If it's so bad why don't you stop all the Alaska oil transiting through BC waters to Wash State? Or are you not aware?
201 2018-04-12 23:42:07 i plan on making anointing oil. anybody have any advice.
can i get some feed back
202 2018-04-12 23:42:06 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to anyone who can rustle up $50 and a smile. We won't even miss it!
203 2018-04-12 23:42:01 Obese people can still fire guns and change tires and shit....I mean they might take four hours, but they can do it!
204 2018-04-12 23:41:55 Boy I got my oil changed today and I thought the buffies were gone I almost had a heart attack 
205 2018-04-12 23:41:53 We don’t need their oil. We are becoming one of the highest producers ourselves
206 2018-04-12 23:41:51 Imagine what will happen when oil goes back up to $120 per barrel.
207 2018-04-12 23:41:51 Most definitely. Oil turns rancid. Keep mine in fridge so they last longer
208 2018-04-12 23:41:43 Anytime I hear noises about the price of crude oil in the past and now, I ask about the current exchange rate then and now. #WeMove
209 2018-04-12 23:41:40 Why would you take even one dollar from big oil?
210 2018-04-12 23:41:36 Cool, so they are a one issue party: oil. I don't know about Trudeau's unicorn farms, they seem to be doing better than Harper's and Kenny's darkness and ignorance corrals.
211 2018-04-12 23:41:23 So, based on that theory, 11000 jobs inc car dealers, can he do the math post a major oil spill, and would the industry ensure NO jobs were lost, given their obvious concern for workers wellbeing
212 2018-04-12 23:41:22 Me and Beth putting oil on the floor outside the bathroom is genuine.
213 2018-04-12 23:41:18 Good! EPA is BS!! I experienced/viewed North Dakota oil boom first hand. Halliburton destroyed ND for years, no EPA in sight. I was shocked, EPA is a tool used by politicians.
214 2018-04-12 23:41:10 With the oil levels depleting.
Africa needs to be tap into R&D on electric automobiles.
We can’t always be followers!
This time we will lead.
We have the sunlight in abundance!
215 2018-04-12 23:41:07 Having short hair really been a clutch for me lately. Just wash, mold, let it dry, add some oil and you good to go

218 2018-04-12 23:40:55 I've been putting highlight on my body. I usually warm up coconut oil in my hands and then sprinkle or grab a little piece of highlight and rub it everywhere. 
219 2018-04-12 23:40:46 I have to use coconut oil in mine
220 2018-04-12 23:40:41 He’s likely going to offer huge sums of taxpayer money to ‘buy off’ BC.Results will be maximum political gain&absolute minimal help for the oil industry, which the trust fund dilettante & eco-extremist PM Butts wants destroyed. Look at the carnage in Ontario where Butts worked
221 2018-04-12 23:40:33 You have no idea how much I'm loving this. 
222 2018-04-12 23:40:30 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
223 2018-04-12 23:40:23 I'm not saying they don't, but your asking the people that live on the coast, who's livelihood is the coast to risk or sacrifice everything they have so that we can increase production in the oil patch and give MORE to the people you've identified? That doesn't seem fair!
224 2018-04-12 23:40:16 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
225 2018-04-12 23:40:13 If anyone here thinks they will save the planet by stopping a pipeline that is helping Alberta, your wrong.  If we dont supply the oil someone else will.  Supply and demand.  When your filling up your cars remember that.
226 2018-04-12 23:40:10 I think it's leaking oil. 기름이 새는 것 같아요.
227 2018-04-12 23:40:08 I don't have much hope. I expect Trudeau is more likely to try and persuade Notley not to restrict the oil to BC, rather than attempt to get  Horgan to concede.
228 2018-04-12 23:39:58 Not a toner but the Kiehls dark spot correcting oil helped a lot plus the same cream from indeed (drugstore) soo good as well, I used them at the same time
229 2018-04-12 23:39:58 Shrimp was coated in Cajun seasoning, we like Luzianne, and sautéed in a little olive oil. Salad is just iceberg lettuce and whatever toppings you choose. Squeeze a lemon over the top instead of dressing. :)
230 2018-04-12 23:39:49 I've found that I like it on somethings in place of mayo. But I still prefer mayo myself! Or the mayo with olive oil.
231 2018-04-12 23:39:42 Yeah but she suggested almond oil bc it's better for skin
232 2018-04-12 23:39:42 Bonds and gold fell, and oil rose as the economic clouds cleared @MicMcCarthy_CMC
233 2018-04-12 23:39:35 The Oil Can is loud tonite! #GoBolts
234 2018-04-12 23:39:30 Spray one of them with citrus oil from the rind of a fresh lemon. They love that.
235 2018-04-12 23:39:13 It's all paper, no substance.  You are selling us out to the waning oil industry. Haven't seen subsidies for alt/green energies from you. The LOOP will take care of KM's dreams.  It's not economically viable.  Pipe dreams.  #bcpoli #cdnpoli
236 2018-04-12 23:39:12 Serious ? to all Canadians: if we commit to expanding oil sands (& all other countries follow the same economic logic), why are we bothering with any climate action at all? It’s costly & pointless. If we don’t feel urgent action is needed let’s do nothing then. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
237 2018-04-12 23:39:00 This lady had the audacity to bring a basket in full of smoked salmon aqutuk, seal oil, pilot bread and tea. I am weeeeeeet 
238 2018-04-12 23:38:55 Not only did Oklahoma give huge tax breaks to big gas & oil, they put a tax and a fine on solar energy. This should be part of the debate.
239 2018-04-12 23:38:46 石油王『OIL！？』

くっそ笑ったwww
240 2018-04-12 23:38:43 I was after my divorce was finalized, I started using cbd oil in vape form. It helped a lot, it doesn’t make you feel high at all but helps remove the anxiety feeling. Seriously. Xoxo feel better!! 
241 2018-04-12 23:38:38 韓国からおはよーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
242 2018-04-12 23:38:38 Blimey!!!! She will be teaching how to cook with oil, right????
243 2018-04-12 23:38:35 imagine being someone who cares more about the oil industry than climate change reduction and environmental preservation for future generations. i can't
244 2018-04-12 23:38:26 Then show your support by fixing roads (using some of the oil)    Support the oil industry not the Green Party!
245 2018-04-12 23:38:25 Y’all my hair is growing really fast out of no where... but my scalp is itching SOOOOO bad. What can I do  I’ve done tea tree, peppermint, coconut and olive oil. I’m just about to lay my head in water for a few hours because I can’t take it
246 2018-04-12 23:38:14 I clean my face with tea tree oil oatmeal honey & egg whites & I use vitamin E oil for moisturizer
247 2018-04-12 23:38:14 nothing says competent leadership like the old thumbs up they are like a bunch of 5 year old playing at being politicians the world needs grown ups with actual solutions to real problems not bumper sticker spouting snake oil salesmen
248 2018-04-12 23:38:07 honestly the biggest sext in the world is when ur at a rlly good italian restaurant and they bring u warm bread and olive oil while u wait for ur food
249 2018-04-12 23:38:02 It’s grown, but must we compare..... cause we already went through pictures ........I’ve known you for 6 and haven’t seen any growth. You may need some more oil or just stop it ain’t working for you. Neither is the color
250 2018-04-12 23:38:00 I feel like that’s going to get everywhere . And then your skin getting burnt over that baby oil .
251 2018-04-12 23:37:51 Olive oil =  Olives = 
252 2018-04-12 23:37:45 Yes. They should continue to fight and we should continue to support them.  Our children deserve more than the scraps of funding left over from Big Oil and our For Profit Prison System.
253 2018-04-12 23:37:44 Thanks! Using Cantu coconut oil cream and Eco Styler gel right now. May switch to Shea Moisture products as the weather changes.
254 2018-04-12 23:37:40 Hmm... I've been getting this push towards doing an online store.... But which one is the question... So far, CBD oil is the top runner...y'all interested? I got oil vape pens on deck 2! #CBDOil #Hemp #AmazingBenefits #NeedInfo ?
255 2018-04-12 23:37:34 She was a good one... until she decided to dump all of her oil on Grand Parkway 
256 2018-04-12 23:37:30 i only smoke joints & oil down here 
257 2018-04-12 23:37:29 Love this but PLEASE switch to an SPF oil (carrot oil has amazing sun protection). Baby oil puts the suns rays on 1000 and can turn Black skin into a hyperpigmented, damaged, mess  speaking from experience, my glow was adorable until it really really wasn’t.
258 2018-04-12 23:37:25 Only big oil and ICE manufactures are.
259 2018-04-12 23:37:17 Some of the commentariat’s claims around @jacindaardern’s announcement of #NoNewDrilling yesterday are bizarre. 

First, they repeated oil industry falsehood that government did not consult. Then @Megan_Woods, @ShaneJonesNZ & @jamespeshaw pointed out they’d consulted for months.
260 2018-04-12 23:37:05 have u tried the neutrogena hydro boost? im on my third jar it's so good fjfjsfnfkd also the cosrx oil free lotion is my go-to for daytime in the summer
261 2018-04-12 23:37:03 That will tip over unless it’s a triangle or square like an oil platform.
262 2018-04-12 23:36:59 is that baby oil?
263 2018-04-12 23:36:57 Yes, because the world will use less oil if we let Alberta get $%#*’d.  Your delusional.   Supply and demand
264 2018-04-12 23:36:21 hmm, but aren't a chunk of those two-thirds oil rich countries, including in the Gulf? not sure those should really count, since the societies themselves didn't really generate those outcomes
265 2018-04-12 23:36:18 I need a oil change 
266 2018-04-12 23:36:12 I bought an oil diffuser because of my aniexty and mixed Lavender (1 drop) and Peppermint (3 drops) and now I want to fall asleep. 
267 2018-04-12 23:36:05 @SteveScalise increase oil reserves 41% extracting oil from coal plant . nothing new perfected in WW 11 cleaner than drilling
268 2018-04-12 23:35:55 This organization continues to impress me. Oil fan for life but VGK are becoming my 2nd favorite
269 2018-04-12 23:35:54 Thanks 
270 2018-04-12 23:35:51 Add a dash of NinasAlmeriaGold Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil
271 2018-04-12 23:35:48 Apparently you aren't old enough to remember  Qaddafi. For 40 years he ran an authertian government.  He stole from his government, slaughtered his people.He was responsible for record human rights violations in Africa. To many ignored his long term damage because oil.
272 2018-04-12 23:35:24 so yesterday during our cultural (cooking) class, when we had to fry an egg, girl beside me (from a different class) decides to drop the egg from a high height into the puddle of oil in her pan which lead to a shower of oil splashbacks onto my arm (!!)
273 2018-04-12 23:35:01 When oil change? 
274 2018-04-12 23:35:01 勝手ながらnanaのアイコンにしちゃったいいかしら
275 2018-04-12 23:35:00 Another advantage of dumping oil in favor of solar and wind- you take the money away from evil regimes that depend on oil money
276 2018-04-12 23:34:46 Im really torn. I love some yummy ketchup + fries, but I've had some truffle oil, garlic, etc aioli that blew me away. The feeling of guilt made it taste better, no doubt.
277 2018-04-12 23:34:35 almond or vit e oil w essential oil mixed in
278 2018-04-12 23:33:54 Clean air, water, soil is more abundant... oil nuclear is dark ages
279 2018-04-12 23:33:45 @TonyRobbins you are a total scam preying on insecure people. Promising to make them rich  or stars or sucessfull. You are a slime televangelist. And the fact that you targeted hurt women ....your days are over. Snake oil salesman.
280 2018-04-12 23:33:41 Mmmm but no one gives a shit about what the Saudis are doing in Yemen or the Israeli’s to the Palestinians. It’s more about oil and power.

285 2018-04-12 23:33:00 You have oil stains on your driveway
286 2018-04-12 23:32:56 The left will try to make you think that the price of oil is what caused the lack of work in Alberta, not the government, but yet the US is booming, and we’re suffering.
287 2018-04-12 23:32:54 It always has been to gain control of existing pipelines and reverse the direction of the flow of oil.....
288 2018-04-12 23:32:48 Blame oil producing companies and the weak Rand
289 2018-04-12 23:32:44 i used to use some canola oil instead of an egg, but i wasnt vegan, just really poor
290 2018-04-12 23:32:43 I'd take him at @LFC in a heartbeat. @IlkayGuendogan is class and if City fans can't see that then the oil money has gone to their head.

291 2018-04-12 23:32:40 Interesting reading, especially the part about people crying foul about the supposed ‘snake oil’. I’d love to hear a parody ad read for actual snake oil sometime

298 2018-04-12 23:31:16 Here's the problem.. if you stop commercial sale of seals, you pretty much garauntee the demise of the inuit people. This is their livelihood and one of the only viable ways to sustain themselves economically.. or would you rather have them take an oil drilling deal?
299 2018-04-12 23:31:13 It would be nice if you represented all the BC men and women who live in BC and work in the Alberta oil industry.  We count in the thousands !!!
300 2018-04-12 23:31:05 I tried the CBD oil and it helped with anxiety and helped for sleeping but didn’t do anything for my level of pain. I sure wish it would’ve.
301 2018-04-12 23:30:59 Wasn't too crazy about it, coconut oil is so good for your skin, body, hair, and I'm allergic to coconuts so I can snuggle underneath it.

Until it did :)
307 2018-04-12 23:30:20 We welcome investors in alternative/green energies!  They know this province is wide open. There's more jobs in that than in the waning oil industry in AB - the fossil province.  #bcpoli #cdnpoli

312 2018-04-12 23:29:52 People: "The pipeline will leak!"

Every oil company ever:
"No! Our pipeline will have the best anti-leak technology! There will be no problems!"

*Pipeline leaks and spills thousands of gallons of oil*

"We could not possibly have forseen this happening."

313 2018-04-12 23:29:47 So California can thank the Agricultural industry, the Entertainment Industry, Silicon Valley, Manufacturing, and a Decent amount of Oil fields. Yea buddy, regular people get nothing from being employed by a diversified economy.
314 2018-04-12 23:29:37 Assad is being framed. Do the research as to whom he is and his beliefs. He defends and protects the Coptic Christains of his county. It's the radical Islamic factions funded by globalist committing the chaos. They need Asad out of the way to take Syria's oil.
315 2018-04-12 23:29:35 Smart move to absorb all excess oil produced in SAUDI and to maintain high prices of oil globally. Disadvantage the multi billion dollar investment project does not create SAUDI jobs.

321 2018-04-12 23:29:10 My wife is saying people liked the vegan cake I made. It isn't that much different from something I'd normally make except no eggs and vegetable oil instead of butter. So I'll hold onto that recipe (someone even asked for the link lol)

323 2018-04-12 23:28:45 If you have the right to open accounts in Canadian financial institutions (I haven't checked the restrictions lately), they seem pretty good (even with Trudeau and the oil price), and crucially most of them will allow you to keep accounts in U.S. dollars.

325 2018-04-12 23:28:08 I have one too now and someone told me to use tee tree oil or aspirin paste, I’m going to try it tonight

327 2018-04-12 23:27:25 Where do they sell hemp seed oil? And would you happen to know some of the benefits of hemp seed oil vs other oils like grapeseed, etc?
328 2018-04-12 23:27:17 Looks like what Saddam did during the Gulf War with the oil fields. What vermin.
329 2018-04-12 23:27:03 Rubbish, Queen will meet Ardern as part of normal round of mtgs for new PMS and thought Ardern was burning oil to attend CHOGM and party with Justin.NOT NEWS!!
330 2018-04-12 23:26:59 ..exactly correct ...the agenda is set ...Syria will be divided if it takes the lives of 50k more Americans.  Oil and Gas lobbyists are way more influential than mere peasants.

340 2018-04-12 23:25:24 we made this middle east mess, this country created the turmoil when oil was discovered. WW 3 is at our doorstep, don't delude yourself.
341 2018-04-12 23:25:09 Aramco is HUGE! Bigger than any U.S. oil company.
342 2018-04-12 23:24:34 Thanks Paul. Easy to see you are now owned by Bloomberg, the greatest financial source of oil and gas disinformation I am aware of. Was that an interview, or a critique?  Check the carbon footprint in California. the real question you failed to address is foreign disinformation.
343 2018-04-12 23:24:31 Me too! I already bought my baby oil and a empty perfume bottle lmao, I’ll let you know if it works 
344 2018-04-12 23:24:28 we made this middle east mess, our government created the turmoil when oil was discovered. WW 3 is at our doorstep, don't delude yourself.
345 2018-04-12 23:24:22 It is laughable to call it rigorous and the only people it benefits is the oil companies
346 2018-04-12 23:24:21 Oh sorry. Hovered over your name and said I was blocked. Im new to this Twitter blocking thing. And you're clearly not as sensitive as I thought you were. I wish you all the best despite our disagreements. In the end we all want the Oil to be better.

357 2018-04-12 23:22:37 Why would BC back off? You need someone with a spine to stand up to him. One is spineless wind bag and the other is a female wind bag. Notley is to scared to shut down energy talks, refuse BC wine and pinch the oil back. KM should be more pissed at the feds and Notley.

and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.

364 2018-04-12 23:22:02 As Asia and Europe move away from fossil fuels we will be left in the Stone Age of energy with no return on our investment. I don't see why you want to go down on the sinking ship of American oil and gas.
365 2018-04-12 23:21:38 Occupied is a great series, its about when Russia invaded Norway after the Norwegians shut down oil supply...

oh wait...
366 2018-04-12 23:21:37 As an Albertan, I wholeheartedly agree. The problem is the oil and gas industry paid a whole lot of money to a whole lot of people for a whole lot of nothing during the boom; now a whole lot of Albertans feel entitled to high paying, low skill jobs with low barriers of entry.
367 2018-04-12 23:21:36 so sad I was trying to order the oil slick lip gloss but it is sold outt waahh @qveenherby

373 2018-04-12 23:20:57 All those terrorists passed into Syria through Turkey unrestricted and unchallenged. Both the US and Russia have evidence that Erdogan and son were purchasing oil from ISIS. Turkey was paying $$ ISIS and even providing them with weapons.
374 2018-04-12 23:20:47 Also still losing my shit at “Pour boiling hot oil into the engine of your passion” cause that’s the rawest line I’ve ever heard
375 2018-04-12 23:20:34 2) You cannot save American manufacturing jobs with protectionist trade policies anymore than you can save whaling jobs by outlawing oil. The way to save America workers is by embracing the changing economy, and provide better education to train workers for the jobs of tomorrow

379 2018-04-12 23:20:07 Well, that's certainly what the oil & gas companies claim.
380 2018-04-12 23:20:03 Ireland has lots of oil and gas. The profits from that if utilised correctly would far outweigh any 'subsidies', based on money paid to the EU. Irish people are very capable of creating jobs in an economy based on equality. #Hope over #Fear #brexit

Asia doesn't need it.  
They are going Full throttle Fuel Cell power drive  and  Stationary Power. 
If you want, fill a massive blimp with NG or Hydrogen.  Throw out the anchor over China, and reel her in. And charge admission.

393 2018-04-12 23:18:58 Under 2C rising c-price & falling oil price make oil sands growth uneconomic. Still huge oil reserves. Thought you've seen the studies. E-mail and I'll send my latest, which references them. Also c-price / cap in AB is misleading - only small % of GHG face charge.
394 2018-04-12 23:18:58 Not sure why providing China with oil is that important

405 2018-04-12 23:16:09 Those who say the U.S. goes to the Middle East for the oil, that indicates their preference the oil revenues be used to fund terrorist activities.

415 2018-04-12 23:14:50 Not sure if I agree with that assessment under current conditions. Oil prices aren’t really that high. Most metals are well below their peaks. Oil price in particular has a lot of moving parts right now

418 2018-04-12 23:14:30 @carolemacneil  The only out for Horgan it seems to me is to find a way to offer better methods to prevent oil spills off the coast. It seems that there is no confidence that the current safeguards are sufficient. So more to resources, more research in cleaning it up perhaps.
419 2018-04-12 23:14:27 Mom: I'm looking at the sea and there are no waves. It's very still like cooking oil in a frying pan not being used.

424 2018-04-12 23:14:12 Change oil and transmission. 
425 2018-04-12 23:14:11 All they want is to use more solar and wind and more fuel efficient cars. What's the fukking big deal unless you are the oil industry?!
426 2018-04-12 23:14:01 Mike Pompeo is a liar & has failed us & is crooked also. Their is "NOT" one honest person in the entire Republican Party it seems! Here this man has lied about owning anything & yet he owns 2 businesses a Chinese Oil Company & a Gas Co. Pompeo must not be allowed further. Fired.
427 2018-04-12 23:13:57 I was either going to change my oil or go get my hair cut. Now I'm going to do neither.
428 2018-04-12 23:13:56 my mom bought me coconut oil for my hair cause it’s broken like i’ve been through some serious electrocution this is why you shouldn’t go platinum blonde
429 2018-04-12 23:13:35 Alas if may goes with Trump who knows what is next! But then something should have been done about Syria years ago.
Sad truth is there is not enough Oil to worry about in Syria.
430 2018-04-12 23:13:31 You mean it would fall apart without the oil ? Yes your correct . Think BC enjoys paying high gas prices lmao

441 2018-04-12 23:12:34 I think Suzuki is a pretty big hypocrite, but this article is garbage.  Do a google search of Kootenay Oil Distributors, and you will see they used to sell furnace oil in the 50's and 60's.  In my opinion Ezra Levant is just as bad as the far leftists.
442 2018-04-12 23:12:26 A quick chime in here...what if we used a portion of the revenues from oil to week ourselves off of it.  Fund alternative energy research with a portion of oil generated revenue.  At least then we are working towards a better future.
443 2018-04-12 23:12:19 Nice thing about renewable energy:  the jobs around it can go on forever. Oil jobs won't.
444 2018-04-12 23:12:17 Sí le sirvió de ejemplo, pregunto; ¿También tenemos un fondo de ahorro como ellos, para enfrentar la crisis petrolera? El control y la regulación de la extracción está a cargo de la empresa estatal, Stat Oil. 
Pemex está casi extinta. Cállese mejor.

451 2018-04-12 23:11:20 KM never had a spill. The oil industry isnt dieing the demand is increasing and will continue for 12 years then leveloff for a while then decline. but oil will be required for many years to come.

456 2018-04-12 23:11:07 To answer my question - the biggest problem is the plant obviates the need for oil, gas, coal. A few truck-loads would power a big city for decades.  Where's the business model in the supply chain?  There is none! Build the plant and it runs on next to nothing, as if by magic
457 2018-04-12 23:11:00 @BBC why isn't the European Union doing way more to flow Russia's cash cow of oil from pouring into europe.they then use that money to build their military. Support assad in gasing innocent woman and children. Good way to deal with russia is financially right now with oil.

468 2018-04-12 23:09:52 The British adventures in Iraq were successful – a lot of infrastructure was destroyed and neither Libyan oil, nor Iraq oil appeared on the market in large volumes. The same approach used in Syria, with less success. Iranian oil was prevented coming to market by sanctions.
469 2018-04-12 23:09:46 Never said anything about oil in New England. I'm not prejudiced against Iranians, but am not predisposed to allow them to nationalize property of Americans or support terrorist activities. Liberals are, of course, so predisposed.

476 2018-04-12 23:09:13 That's bunker crude oil not Diesel fuel. You never know whats mixed in with it. Some ships use a cleaner fuel to head into port but use the cheaper, much dirtier bunker crude while out to sea. That's the way it was when I worked at a Marine Fuel Co. many years ago. Nasty stuff!
477 2018-04-12 23:09:13 Two points: 1) depicting this as a zero-sum game of oil supply limits your analysis, and 2) electoral fortunes could be about more than just pipelines, though no actors are choosing alternative routes

482 2018-04-12 23:08:29 That 70s period was the last time inflation was high in stable democracies. A combo of oil price shocks, Vietnam War transmitted inflation via fixed exchange Bretton Woods era, union wage demands etc.
483 2018-04-12 23:08:22 For the most part, yea. Thanks! Sometimes I come home, and I can hardly walk, and it’s swollen and sore, but better all the time. I keep getting injections of synvisc (sp?) -it’s like an oil change for the knee.

Nonsense, sir. Patent nonsense.

Have you seen some of the assumptions in that paper - basically assumes consumers happy with cheapo Chinese bubbly in replacement of champagne.

503 2018-04-12 23:05:58 So there aren't any environmental impacts of damming rivers?  What about places that don't have rivers to dam?  Would you rather have coal fired plants?  Shale oil plants?  Nuclear plants?

507 2018-04-12 23:05:22 Mhmh. Un scented oil free is what I use when it happens.

521 2018-04-12 23:03:19 Iran showed no inclination to work with the U.S. on any issue, at not until it was attacked by Iraq. There is no evidence that oil companies had any influences on policies. That's just something leftists like to say.

560 2018-04-12 22:58:40 We can already run the country with the crude we have. Our usage does not demand expansion. Neither does our export relative to the growth of the oil and gas industry in other countries. We will have to sell our product at a price that will make expansion & production too costly.

565 2018-04-12 22:57:49 The "tiny" spill in Vancouver harbour cost BC plenty.  Once the stuff is on the tanker the oil company has no responsibility.  Try and collect from a company whose ships fly flags of convenience.
566 2018-04-12 22:57:35 no more oil tankers for the east either
567 2018-04-12 22:57:23 Yea he was. Yea man them Saudis have all that oil money. They aren’t putting on a card like that in the middle of the desert with out some cash flowing.
568 2018-04-12 22:57:19 You clearly don't understand how anything works.  Hillary would have kept all of Obama's initiatives in place.  The way the world works is that states and municipalities allow fracking because it provides cheaper, cleaner energy than coal and oil.

570 2018-04-12 22:57:15 With the 50% increase in US spending for American oil and gas infrastructure and production, and Canada’s 47% decrease in spending, and the US industry growth, America will stop looking to Canada anyway. It’s a matter of time.
571 2018-04-12 22:57:10 Overheard on the subway: “Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. I am not hungry, I am not thirsty. I’m here today just trying to get high. So if any of y’all have any weed, gange, oil, or cannibus, I’d really, really like to get high tonight.” #onlyinNY
572 2018-04-12 22:56:52 I urge Premier Horgan to stand fast against the pipeline and, particularly, the oil tankers that will inevitably devastate Canada's western coastline. I voted NDP because of your opposition to the project.  If you cannot uphold this position I will be voting elsewhere.
573 2018-04-12 22:56:41 I'm in need of some pallets. Preferably HT (Heat Treated), but at the very least clean. NO oil, or chemical spills because these are going to be used to grow food. Can anyone help me out with acquiring some pallets? Nothing illegally obtained please! LOL!

576 2018-04-12 22:56:15 Winston campaigned on giving Taranaki a percentage of revenue from oil and gas to put back into the region ? Did he forget or is he getting another of his bottom lines to sell out the people of NZ !

578 2018-04-12 22:56:01 :) yeah, it looks weird but it shows that someone there has a brain, they can use hemp for 99% of the things they are using oil now
579 2018-04-12 22:55:55 Because for some reason the West has a bleeding heart for the M E. Maybe when we don't need oil we won't do it? Or are we all paying a debt for the crusades? Think we should say sod them myself and action S.A instead.
580 2018-04-12 22:55:55 You fill each empty square with a bit of MOTOR OIL to complete the zoning. It looks rather striking to you. You can hardly imagine that an up and coming young can trying to make it in the world would not be delighted to live in your fair district.
581 2018-04-12 22:55:41 Quick poll Oil fans know what I’m talking about
582 2018-04-12 22:55:38 Google the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), terminal built deep in the Mississippi Delta.  Makes the KM pipeline irrelevant.  VLCC's can ship to Asian markets cheaper than out of BC.  KM is a poor investment.  Oil spills r nor really cleaned up. Who pays 4 BC's lost economy?
583 2018-04-12 22:55:31 Just watching your documentary. I'm sure CBD oil available in UK
584 2018-04-12 22:55:30 Look, sorry if you aren't actually in Germany. Lots of fakey stuff afoot, particularly as regards oil in Canada, and your location pin says Germany. Thought you might not be real. And you might not. But if you are, please consider our coast, and our enviro's future.
585 2018-04-12 22:55:29 (Overheard at Scotty O'Boyle's):

593 2018-04-12 22:54:24 Why not?   That is just Big Oil wanting all the benefits of access to the resource without paying their share.  They pay Nigeria 6 times as much per barrel, for heavens sake.  Canadians have been suckers.

600 2018-04-12 22:53:20 Since when does the oil and gas industry represent the whole of Canadian business interests? Your swipe was too easy. Canada is deeper and more progressive than diggers of dirt, and you know that.
601 2018-04-12 22:53:17 How does anyone actually live in Denver? Do y’all have to douse yourself in oil everyday so your skin doesn’t crack? This place is dry as hell.
602 2018-04-12 22:53:06 PBS ran a story on the corruption in the coal and oil industry. Scott Pruitt was prominently featured as a fixer for the lobbyist in Oklahoma and thus why he was picked for the EPA by Trump, to overturn Obama regulations.
603 2018-04-12 22:53:03 Help!!!! What vegetables is vegetable oil made of?!?
604 2018-04-12 22:52:59 Why are Conservatives so invested in oil. At the moment it costs more to extract oil from the oil sands unless we can sell it for 100$ a barrel. Clean renewable energy is getting cheaper and we need to move in on this and create new industries and jobs
605 2018-04-12 22:52:54 I may have to hide in my room with Great British Bake-Off and some lavender essential oil tonight just to be sure.
606 2018-04-12 22:52:41 I find spraying a little lavender oil on my pillow helps.

Don't waste taxpayer money on this useless pipeline or argue that it provides jobs since they're all deadend
612 2018-04-12 22:51:39 He is a lobbyist who will continue the attack on the environment in support of the blood money from the oil and gas industries.

614 2018-04-12 22:51:25 so quebec is all for polluting the st Lawrence seaway with raw sewage but totally against a heavily regulated pipeline expansion. furthermore quebec will take the dirty oil money from the west.  boy can i smell the hypocrisy

617 2018-04-12 22:51:09 Rewatched the video.  Oil is in the parkas they wore, the boots they wore, the sign they had hanging, likely the paint used on the signs.  Hypocrites!
618 2018-04-12 22:50:50 Try the Milani which is on beauty bay OR makeup revolution have come out w new foundations and I’ve heard they’re amazing x
As for dry skin every night after u wash ur face use toner and aloe Vera jel 
Try an oil under ur foundation too that helps, only a bit tho x
619 2018-04-12 22:50:45 ok how’s this?

620 2018-04-12 22:50:38 Old saying in the police is " the squeaky wheel will get the oil". Make enough fuss and you achieve your goal.
621 2018-04-12 22:50:36 They are too dependent on Russian gas and oil.
622 2018-04-12 22:50:29 You could draw him as a baby in his nappy with his current head sitting on a map of the middle east claiming "Mine" as he snatches at oil, gas, pipelines like toys.

624 2018-04-12 22:49:40 @AD_Keto FYI if you fry a hamburger in peanut oil on the stove it’s the most amazing thing ever.  Comparable to Five Guys even in my opinion. Add onion powder pepper and pink Himalayan and you are set.
625 2018-04-12 22:49:39 So Syria and Assad just celebrated ridding themselves of Terrorist rebels and ISIS, and he goes and gasses his own, so to bring worldwide condemnation and war. This is a f-cking False Flag, and no one noticed that China just gold backed the Yuan, to use to sell/purchase oil

634 2018-04-12 22:48:19 To the tune of $1.5 TRILLION deficit.Makes so much sense. BTW , stock market ended this quarter in the RED and Jobs was far less than expected. Oil prices reached highest prices since 2014. So what little tax cuts from #GOPTAXSCAM are taken back with rising gas and heating oil

652 2018-04-12 22:46:37 Canada possesses the worlds second largest known reserves of oil and gas, yet we pay some of the highest prices on the planet for gas.  Complete government corruption and over taxation.  Gas here should be the same as it is in the USA, essentially half of what we pay.
653 2018-04-12 22:46:36 That’s my work whip, haven’t washed it since last oil change lol
654 2018-04-12 22:46:34 Blephagel is working well for me. Used since January to unblock the lid pores so the natural eye oil can get into tears and lubricate the eye normally. Two chalazions have resolved since then also ,after having 3 surgically removed before.
655 2018-04-12 22:46:30 Canada has lots of oil to share, just can't get environmentalists to give pipelines a break. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian oil and gas, no?
656 2018-04-12 22:46:27 let me get this right just cause you returned a favor that was overdue you want me to be yr colony?

661 2018-04-12 22:46:14 “Shutting off” the oil has nothing to do with the integrity of the structure itself.
662 2018-04-12 22:46:06 Those who don't have intimate knowledge and experience of indigenous people of the arctic should zip it, worry about climate change and oil spills that drastically effect the environment and animal populations

665 2018-04-12 22:45:25 can we stop this ridiculous generalisation that if BC does not want to approve business that is dangerous to our province that somehow this means that no other businesses can invest here? oil and pipelines are not everything. stop fear mongering.

667 2018-04-12 22:45:23 Why don’t we take the oil?
668 2018-04-12 22:45:14 And that essential oil smells nasty but quite fresh for my skin
669 2018-04-12 22:45:12 I found out today the auto dealer reports your odometer reading when getting oil change to the insurance companies,  there is nothing private
670 2018-04-12 22:45:10 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
671 2018-04-12 22:45:08 Went to jiffy lube for the first time & SHIIIIT(!) they’re so EXPENSIVE! They’re easily twice as expensive as my normal oil place.
Give they probably check more things & they said my wiper blades were bad & gave me a discount on new ones but STILL.
WOW SO MUCH $$$

681 2018-04-12 22:43:50 Canada doesn't have Facebook, Google, Amazon, or GM. We have resource extraction like the oil sands providing thousands of jobs including for First Nations people & billions in investment. If we can't sell our resources to the world we have nothing. #BuildKM #canpoli

685 2018-04-12 22:43:24 .@wielechowski introduces Amendment 13, which would cut oil and gas tax credit payments for the coming year from $184 million to $41 million. He interprets the state law differently than the administration, which he says has a "tortured reading" of the law. #akleg
686 2018-04-12 22:43:21 I totally agree. We should not be the Police if the world. Let Saudia Arabia and other oil rich countries defend the Syrian people. They are in the same region.
687 2018-04-12 22:43:13 Cant replace. But why add more oil infrastructure if the world is trying to lean off fossil fuels. Thats working backwords
688 2018-04-12 22:42:52 Well, we have have to start with:
√ Military Industrial Complex
√ Farm Subsidies
√ Big Oil Subsidies 
√ Corn Subsidies
√ Export Subsidies
Those are just a few to start...
689 2018-04-12 22:42:49 This whole oil and gas issue certainly has created a toxic climate
690 2018-04-12 22:42:48 Syria droped the U.S dollar which is farcical and they don't depend on you're oil and don't send any to you that's a good motive for the elite which is what you're acting like the U.S has no respect in the east except Japan and South Korea and Taiwan just about and Burma
691 2018-04-12 22:42:41 There was no chemical attack . Are you stupid people of America and Britain. Yet again this is all about oil
692 2018-04-12 22:42:24 Yep!
Whenever oil, gas, and pipelines are at issue somebody gets designated "the new Hitler".
It's wearing pretty thin.

696 2018-04-12 22:41:57 This distinction is odd to me Assad has been targeting civilians for years with barrel bombs resulting in ghastly deaths. Chemical weapons deaths are tragic but, why does the US feel compelled to react & risk war, oil shock & economic collapse? US weapons=Civilian deaths in Yemen
697 2018-04-12 22:41:45 We all know that Assad hasn’t now or ever used chemical weapons, it is all a proxy war to nullify Syrian claim to the Golan. If they break up your country then no one apart from those who occupy the Golan now will be entitled to it...and the oil!
698 2018-04-12 22:41:38 It is worth it for the war profiteers and oil tycoons.
699 2018-04-12 22:41:37 What is our oil doing under their sand? Get it at all costs.
700 2018-04-12 22:41:36 Our top export and industry is oil - absolutely should be the priority not selfies
701 2018-04-12 22:41:30 Shit no I can’t change oil
702 2018-04-12 22:41:19 Can’t believe there are still people buying the snake oil the IEA (via Kate Andrews) are selling.
703 2018-04-12 22:41:16 Amendment 13 by Sen Wielechowski cuts the amount of oil and gas tax credits to $41 million, the statutory formula. This is a $143 million cut #akleg #wecantaffordit
704 2018-04-12 22:41:00 1. We tell Putin he's won; has his Middle East satellite and his Mediterranean port.
2. He tells us where the WMD is held and we hit them with missiles.
3. Putin accepts that within a year - Assad meets with an unfortunate mishap.  
OR no access to western banks + oil price drop.
705 2018-04-12 22:40:56 i’m going to the oil spill in my mf play shoes.
706 2018-04-12 22:40:53 Finished the night by pouring diffuser oil all over myself. #winning
707 2018-04-12 22:40:48 Yeah, I try not to stress myself out, but I also miss oil painting. It was something I was good at and it was a way for me to meaningfully express myself. I feel like that may be lacking in my work right now?
708 2018-04-12 22:40:40 Stopped going to @jiffylube after 42 years of oil servicing because of the same stupid air filter trick. Was it worth losing a lifetime of oil servicing stuff for a lousy 20 bucks?
709 2018-04-12 22:40:37 Absolutely hilarious mate. They will never recreate what we have. Could buy 50 league titles and would still be a tin pot little club with an oil baron sugar Daddy.

724 2018-04-12 22:38:10 I lied I did not change my oil and my mechanic coming tomorrow morning 
725 2018-04-12 22:38:08 It's a shame that the EPA is a lobbying arm of big oil and a bigger shame that Republicans are ok with it.
726 2018-04-12 22:38:07 You dudes be over here not even knowing where to check your fucken oil in your car demanding a women have this and that...
727 2018-04-12 22:38:07 He says the Trans Mountain pipeline is a fight for Canada and a fight for decency (going back to the argument that Alberta’s oil is ethical compared to regimes like Venezuela). #ableg
728 2018-04-12 22:37:56 Use coconut oil
729 2018-04-12 22:37:48 @realDonaldTrump Hmm just waiting for the oil price get up more and more.. Sad politics.. And after barrel of oil will be over 90-100 $ USA and Russia will be best friends again...

732 2018-04-12 22:37:09 So what about the profit of Islam???  Oil, Oil, Oil!!!
733 2018-04-12 22:36:57 No one has any idea how much oil has been extracted. Also no one has any idea how much was there to start with. Therefore it is impossible to know how much is left. If we suppose there is enough the size of the Mediterranean, then there is sufficient for 1 million years usage.
734 2018-04-12 22:36:55 #Trudeau can take his #TransMountain pipeline East, north or south from #Alberta but he's not coming West to destroy our #BritishColumbian Coastline with Alberta's dirty oil. B.C. doesn't benefit from this pipeline so why should they? #AlternativeEnergy #TrudeauMustGo #QAnon
735 2018-04-12 22:36:52 Interesting, and convincing.

I always thought the troubles in the Middle East since first Gulf War were all about oil/gas.

But then started to think it was more about religious dominance. Maybe I fell for the cover story.

Oil/Gas = money = power = evil,
Makes sense.
736 2018-04-12 22:36:51 Agreed.  They just have to wipe out ISIS and stop WMD's and get out.  We don't want their country, their oil, their money or their religion - we have plenty of our own.
737 2018-04-12 22:36:45 i dreamt i drew this really amazing painting of kings of con, with all the characters in an oil style, loved it,,,,,,,, and then i woke up to the sound of my alarm OTL
738 2018-04-12 22:36:39 Lol, as in ...with Crude oil and not  engine oil

740 2018-04-12 22:36:15 But, but, but. How is EU suppose to survive. Allow the complete GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa so EU can have oil= Climate change.
741 2018-04-12 22:36:15 Paul Ryan is retiring because he sees the writing on the wall. More than that Ryan has made enough money off the gov and the tax payers. He got rich taking money from NRA and Koch bros  big oil   insurance cos  and last but not least big pharma.
742 2018-04-12 22:36:00 We can't handle the pollution from crude oil (e.g. Port Harcourt soot).

But we want fund coal power projects - and coal is a much dirtier fuel.
743 2018-04-12 22:35:46 Time to fill up & run on good oil !
744 2018-04-12 22:35:43 When you slather lavender sleep balm all over your face instead of #lavender replenishing oil. #stinging #red #ohffs
745 2018-04-12 22:35:23 Nah...it shouldn't be built.  It doesn't benefit the majority of Albertans in a significant enough way.
Raise royalties and taxes first. Oil production is at record high levels and we are going broke. This pipeline destroys our climate commitment and doesn't solve the problem.
746 2018-04-12 22:35:19 bacalao! Me too and my Anxious ass takes fish oil every morning for that
747 2018-04-12 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
748 2018-04-12 22:35:11 More about oil pipelines, Tomi.
749 2018-04-12 22:35:01 I don't think so but I stand to be corrected. It has a tingling sensation when applied perhaps it stimulates the hair follicles. It's more of a healing oil, for scars/bruises, blocked nose, etc. For growing beard try castor oil (black Jamaican) Clicks&Dischem sell it.
750 2018-04-12 22:34:57 Why don’t you stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia? That they use to murder children? Oh yeah, I forgot, bloods cheaper than oil

752 2018-04-12 22:34:50 As an Aucklander without power, all the oil in the world doesn’t matter if my powerlines are knocked over by yet another massive storm (which we are likely to see more of the more the climate changes).
753 2018-04-12 22:34:20 They would have preferred a pipeline.  Oh right, Energy East was cancelled so east coast now pays premium for their oil.
754 2018-04-12 22:33:58 You know what else should  be a dealbreaker for old Oil Gore, Single human being who flies around on private jets who resides in multiple homes who equals a larger carbon footprint than the entire state of Rhode Island.
755 2018-04-12 22:33:57 There's definetly not one solution but there are steps we can take to improve. I think one of those would be straying away from progressing in oil
756 2018-04-12 22:33:42 I have the Marula Oil it’s amazing. I was thinking about trying that one out
757 2018-04-12 22:33:32 uh my mom bought me art supplies and i said watercolors AND SHE FPUND OILS AND NOW IM SCARED OF  SETTING THIS HOUSE ON FIRE, BESIDES OIL SEEMS TO BE DIFFICULT AND OH MY GOD I WANNA CRY

759 2018-04-12 22:33:09 I just got a oil change ..
760 2018-04-12 22:33:08 doesn't it assume that the oil/gas ours is replaced with would otherwise have been left in the ground forever? I see no reason to assume this.
761 2018-04-12 22:32:35 quite literally every single other mcdonalds in the world does fries that are just potatoes and oil and a few preservatives. america is the ONLY place to decide that’s not good enough, needs animal products ??

771 2018-04-12 22:31:43 Heartening news about this palm oil decision.
772 2018-04-12 22:31:35 I think we have to get tougher with Russia. I would implement more sanctions that would hurt their economy (using the UNSC countries) and stop using there oil and gas which is making them richer and more arrogant as a nation. Russia is getting out of control without doubt!
773 2018-04-12 22:31:19 Hi Comrade!! How are you doing today? How's the weather in St. Petersberg today? Nice Spin! Doesn't your runt tyrant boss have interests in selling oil to help fill his own personal coffers?
774 2018-04-12 22:31:19 Bush wasn't.

He was fully told by Texaco, those that backed his presidential campaign.  6 months into his presidency the Venezuelan oil workers go on strike. The US loses a lot of crude. One year later they are in Iraq.

You are right about Blair

The quotation is Hanlon's razor
775 2018-04-12 22:31:14 The government of Turkmenistan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Susan Boyle in a cambric wig.

777 2018-04-12 22:31:08 This isn't about a chemical weapons attack on children. Theresa May doesn't care about dead children.

778 2018-04-12 22:31:00 Then use coconut oil!!

780 2018-04-12 22:30:48 Yeah that was pretty rare growing up here - mostly it was these honey’d together cornflakes in a cupcake cup or “chocolate crackles” which it kinda gross really: rice bubbles/coco pops in copha (solid coconut oil) with cocoa - again in the cupcake cups

795 2018-04-12 22:29:18 I'm not talking about what oil does where, or about it's complete cessation now. I'm talking about the non-viablitly/necessity of creating a 30-year infrastructure in an extremely vital and sensitive eco-system for a product we know w must phase out sharpish.
796 2018-04-12 22:29:17 Dilute it, it's too strong on its own. Mix with another oil (olive/coconut/jojoba oil) and use on scalp, face, body and/or scars.
797 2018-04-12 22:29:14 And of course all those baying for blood have faced an armed enemy or have friends and relatives who will have to do that to protect American oil interests

799 2018-04-12 22:29:09 Yeah she takes the oil, she use to take the tea but she hated it xxx
800 2018-04-12 22:29:09 I believe in stomping the KKK. Liberals oppose Iran by clearing the way for them to get nuclear weapons and opposing anything that might inconvenience Iran. U.S. is not obligated to respect the legal status of a nation nationalizing American-owned oil facilities.
801 2018-04-12 22:28:49 They should step up and stop importing oil products too.
802 2018-04-12 22:28:42 Put Jamaican castor oil on my lashes so they can grow lol
803 2018-04-12 22:28:38 You should fight the IS and not start a World War... please think of all the people on the world who would suffer. Also, please be careful what you believe! I have heard that the people who really rule America are the CIA & Co... Gas attacks sound like an excuse for getting oil.
804 2018-04-12 22:28:37 Put 4 table spoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
805 2018-04-12 22:28:31 Also gives Canada time to search elsewhere for our products and resources. Need to safely transport our oil to other markets. On the list would be to sell soy to China.

819 2018-04-12 22:26:57 Musk's snake oil is that he makes his fans feel smart. Many stories like the semi have a lot of blanks which the fans can fill in themselves to make it all fit.

822 2018-04-12 22:26:27 My grandad told us that some Rvers, Cross Rivers and Calabar people have white blood in them because when those white People came to drill the oil they were having children with the indigenes
823 2018-04-12 22:26:25 The signal is that #Shell remains part of the problem instead of the solution because you keep investing the majority of your resources into the development of oil and gas instead of into renewables. So irresponsible.
824 2018-04-12 22:26:17 But where is my baby oil 
825 2018-04-12 22:26:17  it’s my last toyotacare service and I’m going to miss all my dad friends over here. not enough to pay for them to keep doing my oil changes tho lmao

828 2018-04-12 22:25:36 @SpeakerRyan You are bailing on the country, after only 3 years, leaving this pathological liar in charge, when you yourself, can't tolerate Trump, or his base behaviors. You leave the US in trillion dollar debt, IN ONE YEAR. You deregulated safety, so oil can pollute at will.
829 2018-04-12 22:25:32 I hope it helps! when I get home, I can give you the recipe I still use to help my hair grow. Black castor oil is a good start though, if you don’t want to spend on too many oils. Try massaging your scalp too!
830 2018-04-12 22:25:22 Nicki just tipped over an oil truck into a forest on fire
831 2018-04-12 22:25:22 Coal and oil will be not sustainable in the longterm to be competitive enough in this market. The long-term winner in mining will be the companies who find ways to improve the ways of harvesting free/renewable energy like solar, wind, water, heat etc. more efficiently.
832 2018-04-12 22:25:20 My reply was better. 

So are you Queen of the Realm yet or not? I've got boiling oil and hot irons to prepare if not.

834 2018-04-12 22:25:12 It really pissed Putin off when Obama once said Russia “doesn’t produce anything anybody wants.” At least his money isn’t coming from oil. It’s coming from kickbacks from oil....

836 2018-04-12 22:24:59 i thought everyone knew you can create an illuminating cream with body oil and crushed up highlighter?? Or even lotion. like step up. I dont know why yall hype and spend all this money.  there is a dupe for everything and also home made remedies 
837 2018-04-12 22:24:52 WAR? I will accept it when we apply the same criteria to all children being murdered. What about Palestinian children or the ones in Yemen being murdered with weapons that we have sold?? Not a squeak, the difference would seem to be gas/oil..as it ever was. #NotInMyNameTheresaMay
838 2018-04-12 22:24:47 ah I see you mention manbij, but they are also, allegedy yadda yadda, building one near/in omar oil fields, most dangerous one in my opinion as it's near euphrates 'border'

though manbij can get hot if erdogan proceeds in his Kurd extermination crusade
839 2018-04-12 22:24:47 iheiuagweoquypqt%$*se!!!! after seeing this I immediately went to order some Vetiver oil~~~XDDD 
omg...I wanna c Goro smokes Shido's cigarette.
840 2018-04-12 22:24:45 I was talking about makeup in the baby oil. But you probably use a non comedogenic one . Because even certain coconut oils are bad for your skin because the molecular weight is so thick it just sits in your pores. Baby oil is actually kinda bad I usually water it down a little
841 2018-04-12 22:24:32 I guess we'll ignore Alaskan oil coming down BC coast and our imports to meet local demand...

We use oil for many many many things beyond fuels.
842 2018-04-12 22:24:17 Oil and loans to rebuild arms sales construction contracts.Private security mineral rights gas rights . To name a few

849 2018-04-12 22:23:21 It's not going to be "feet on the ground" but long range missiles, no British lives at risk. But something has to be done as Russia are running a mock with chemical weapons. But let's not forget what this really about, oil!
850 2018-04-12 22:22:53 Commodities mixed overnight with gold slumping 1.4% as global tensions eased. Oil flat; copper 1.5% weaker. Aluminium rallied on continuing supply tightness. A$ is steady around US77.5c.
851 2018-04-12 22:22:48 It’s basically sugar and oil lol
852 2018-04-12 22:22:36 Obama's Administration  fooled the people in thinking their country was fighting ISIS,but in fact we were fighting Assad and supplying weaponry to our enemy ISIS. It pays to pay attention! Oil over rules everything else.

858 2018-04-12 22:21:53 So what a good high heat fat that works to create a nonstick surface in an iron frying pan. Tried olive oil doesn't work,- tried coconut oil everything still stuck. Only thing that works is a thin coating of real butter or canola oil, but id love to find a healthy oil that works.
859 2018-04-12 22:21:38 I think it’s important to drizzle olive oil on all the things
860 2018-04-12 22:21:35 US need to control gas and oil in the ME and make sure its traded in dollars or US economy is screwed.

862 2018-04-12 22:21:18 FUCK CAPITALISM you're telling me some dude on wall street makes millions by helping gas companies pour oil on birds and i, a goodhearted civilian, make 0 money being funny and cute....

869 2018-04-12 22:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
870 2018-04-12 22:20:00 Just a reminder that #GenieOil is located in Golan Heights, Syria. Genie Oil is Rupert, Dick Cheney & Rothschild. Recent history proves that at least Cheney & Rupert are gung-ho to go to war for oil. Ask the Iraqis.
871 2018-04-12 22:19:58 Breaking: A truck has spilled some type of oil all over the roadway in Bixby from 146th and Memorial all the way to 111th. Drivers are urged to avoid this area as the Bixby Police Department works to keep the roadway safe.
872 2018-04-12 22:19:58 hah, yup - same here, we ran a wood stove instead of a fuel oil furnace because it was so much cheaper to burn wood than home heating oil

874 2018-04-12 22:19:45 The Koch Family didn’t help kill jews?  Their father made his fortune setting up oil refineries in the Soviet Union.  Then, he built an oil refinery for Nazi Germany.

The refined fuel was used to kill millions.  On the other hand, Soros was 14 in 1945.
875 2018-04-12 22:19:41 Heritage and history don't appear to be words you understand. Don't worry, you can always keep banging on about oil money to ease the pain.
876 2018-04-12 22:19:37 Doesn't Murdoch have a financial stake in a company hoping to bring oil through #Syria? Perhaps it's something Maybot discussed with him over their numerous meetings.
877 2018-04-12 22:19:26 2018 is becoming a year of new oil! #speaksintongues
878 2018-04-12 22:19:19 Crazy that I just read in the newspaper that they’re going to start drilling for oil in alligator alley in the future. Rip to all the animals already barely surviving there already
879 2018-04-12 22:19:19 We (USA) had cut off Japan's supplies of oil because of their invasion of China.
880 2018-04-12 22:19:06 stuff me into an empty oil drum and dump me in a bog

882 2018-04-12 22:18:50 Thanks for this tip. I'll give this a try with Jackie Aina's La Peach highlighter and some sesame seed oil.
883 2018-04-12 22:18:46 I fight for both...and we just had a black man in Minneapolis who was assassinated helping #INDIGENOUS fight #oil we have these conversations I have them every Sabbath 2 highlight certain tribes or protestors being targeted so that these things don't continue or go unnoticed.

885 2018-04-12 22:18:28 Well, if it’s soy free I’d try it. Mayo has soybean oil so I have to try to finds brands that are soy free. No soy oil, soy protein etc.  TOO many foods today have soy in it and that’s frustrating.
886 2018-04-12 22:18:28 Make your own, get the olive oil mayo and sriracha and boom, healthy alternative
887 2018-04-12 22:18:22 The thing was, Snake Oil, the "real" Snake Oil, had opium in it. Like $TSLA shares it made buyers feel good for a while and had a mysterious quality of bringing them back for more. Gin was originally a medicine too. With all these, too much for too long ruined you :)
888 2018-04-12 22:18:21 so some girl was wondering what got rid of migraines and someone recommended putting peppermint oil on the roof of your mouth. this other chick swooped in and brought up how you’re not supposed to ingest them
889 2018-04-12 22:18:20 Syria war = oil war
890 2018-04-12 22:18:14 Shot in black and white: mysterious woman darts across screen in oversized clothes, close up of her breathing heavily, she’s covered in oil for some reason, title slowly fades onto screen— “outfit by body dysmorphia”
891 2018-04-12 22:18:11 If you are referring to the fact that you can get fired at any time then yes... Have you been fired a lot or something? You seem to be against all jobs except in oil.
892 2018-04-12 22:18:03 I can’t standddd getting an oil change like what do yaw be doing to take 2 hours!!

897 2018-04-12 22:17:31 Black castor oil helped my lashes grow, so I knew that might help. And my mom told me about pumpkin seed oil.
898 2018-04-12 22:17:24 I was told last week that, if I bought the Focus essential oil from DoTerra, then it would cure my son’s verbal and motor tics so I won’t have to “keep poisoning him with Western Medicine.”
899 2018-04-12 22:16:57 Lets ask the US oil and gas companies what they think about Syria, add Canada, China, shell oil and Devon energy.  Who is backing who and who is making money while the civilians are starving
900 2018-04-12 22:16:50 What do they expect? Of you don't want oil running through your province then you don't need gas either. Both can pollute both can be spilled so suck it up or open up. I wouldn't just restrict it I would cut it of completely.
901 2018-04-12 22:16:48 Where can I find almond oil?
902 2018-04-12 22:16:45 The proxy war isn't ON the table. It IS the table. The US Gov been supporting terrorist nations like Saudi Arabia and oppressive regimes like Israel - it's no joke - The US depends on their influence in the region specifically for the oil. #TYTLive

906 2018-04-12 22:16:10 Freshly squeezed lime and sea salt is amazing over a red cabbage slaw
Oil, red wine vinegar, caster sugar, soy and sesame
Lastly I love a very garlicky and lemony tahini dressing with a splash of pomegranate molasses
907 2018-04-12 22:15:54 I googled and it said "mayo" has higher oil than "miracle whip" well kush has higher thc than reggie but its still weed

916 2018-04-12 22:14:58 Dilbit is the only chemical in Cda allowed to be transported without an MSDS (oil industry claims "industry secret"). Having worked on the tarsands husband knows what used to dilute bitumen. It's deadly.
917 2018-04-12 22:14:52 Pruitt worked for the oil & gas industry & against the interests of the people of OK, wasting tax payer money along the way. He is bought & paid for & any journalist with integrity would have made that clear. But then again, that info wouldn’t have made it into the paper.

922 2018-04-12 22:14:34 Right, that is why Total, Statoil, Shell and others divested from the oil sands. Have you seen the price of oil lately?
923 2018-04-12 22:14:25 ...only for the oil. *drink*
924 2018-04-12 22:14:08 Basically Herbert based that part off the conflict in middle east over oil, if I'm not wrong. He was, I think, the first author to speak of evironmentalism too.
925 2018-04-12 22:14:08 #Crude $oil $WTI consolidating below 67.45 a five-year high.
926 2018-04-12 22:14:07 typical response from the pro oil crowd...
927 2018-04-12 22:13:51 Really?! What US should be responsible for?Sending terrorists into syria? Givibg finance to rebels? To get more oil fron middle east for low price?To main the power in middle east that fucking american politicans will kill all people in the middle east.they did in iraq,now syria.
928 2018-04-12 22:13:51 Actually, it’s very delicious on fries straight out the oil. You bugging.

932 2018-04-12 22:13:21 Oil is at the heart of all these wars but the other question is why are we always fighting Israel’s wars - #Iraq, #Afghanistan, #Libya, now #Syria.  #Israel would love #Iran to be next.  Let’s see.  If so that really cd lead to WW3.  We’re just pawns in a larger game. #JC4PM

943 2018-04-12 22:12:03 yes gadaffi kept the tribes working together
they should be doing this now speaking to each other and keeping the peace
problem is those outwith the tribes cause mischief to cause trouble and fighting between them whilst libyan oil is stolen
944 2018-04-12 22:12:02 Answer: Oil is not as valuable as you might think, so it clearly has nothing to do with this. Neither do petrodollars and the will of Israel - sorry what was the question again?
945 2018-04-12 22:11:45 dapat talaga investgate ang #malampayafund, a sovereign oil fund, hindi dapat binababoy yan, , UAE , singapore, at Alaska oil fund ingat na ingat sila sa pag utilize,  tayo scam pa...... talagang hindi tayo uunlad
946 2018-04-12 22:11:42 In the current Syria Russia saga I'm a bit surprised there has been little focus on the oil market. A collapsed oil price would bankrupt Putin & Co - Is the US missing a trick with the Saudis here? #realpolitik
947 2018-04-12 22:11:39 Mäh. While the overall argument and debate is certainly valid and important, taking resource extracting high income nondemocratic societies as an example for the purported allure of their model is somewhat flimsy. Autocracy brings you control, it doesn't bring you oil riches.
948 2018-04-12 22:11:38 お仕事めうー！！
949 2018-04-12 22:11:37 Get the oil price down at the same time and they stand to lose their economy. Persuasive.
950 2018-04-12 22:11:20 We need regime change in Syria, we need to flood Europe with immigrants, look at the astounding success of regime change in Libya.  Syria is rich in oil, war is profitable!! Why would our neocon leaders do any other.
951 2018-04-12 22:11:18 How can’t you compare rail to tankers? Remember that little accident in Quebec?

For 70 years oil tankers have navigated the Salish sea and Burrard Inlet with ZERO incidents...

954 2018-04-12 22:11:06 Like most disputes, you have to agree on what is being disputed.  Alberta thinks it's about moving oil to the coast.  BC thinks it about protecting their livelihood and protecting families.
955 2018-04-12 22:11:03 If you want less oil to come over the mountains from the prairies, then use less.

Supply does not create demand. It's the other way around.

965 2018-04-12 22:10:11 It’s a local jurisdictional matter.  Is there a better alternative to coal and oil and nuclear in the vast majority of the country where renewable energy isn’t available?
966 2018-04-12 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this April? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
967 2018-04-12 22:10:09 How about stop taking oil out of the ground and invest in renewables?? Just a thought. Before it's too late. 
968 2018-04-12 22:10:08 Althia, Andrew Coyne continues to say that Alberta will receive a higher price from "overseas" for its 'oil' but it is an outright lie. Please challenge him on this.

971 2018-04-12 22:10:06 I don’t support action, I just think this ‘it’s all about oil’ is wrong. Just because some US companies have invested in those pipelines doesn’t mean they’d invade to support them. I actually think this is about political posturing and bravado.

976 2018-04-12 22:09:54 Wow, that's really an efficient way to move oil. LOL.
977 2018-04-12 22:09:52 i cut the salmon into strips and seasoned with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, red chile flake, and garlic. more surface area means more crispiness in the pan 🖒
978 2018-04-12 22:09:48 KM is 77% owned by Canadians. KM is a pipeline company charging to ship Canadian Oil. Wonder why Koch doesn’t want it going to open market? Bingo...
979 2018-04-12 22:09:19 It's for OIL and SHALE GAS. And the pipelines have already been planned and in part built.
980 2018-04-12 22:09:19 Oh don't even get me started on that waste of space Adi Chopra. That man needs a good slapping. Hardly an oil painting himself he's given half the young ones in the industry a complex about their looks. Bokwass person he is.
981 2018-04-12 22:09:07 The names of things. Tahadi el Burhan (challenge of the champions) on and on. Lots of the mythology is there, the fremen seem like the bedwin Arabs dwellers of the desert, the spice reminds me of the rich oil fields that everyone wants a part of and how westerners came to rule...
982 2018-04-12 22:09:03 It's kind of fun to check the oil in my car without even raising the hood.
983 2018-04-12 22:09:01 Syria have oil....hence the reason Teresa May is rubbing her grubby little talons...
984 2018-04-12 22:08:48 How’s bread and oil fat Cunt ?
985 2018-04-12 22:08:43 I’ve really wanted to try CBD I just haven’t been able to find a place that I can trust I usually just see the oil online or in gas stations :(
986 2018-04-12 22:08:38 The zionists rule the oligarchs (weapon, oil, Goldman Sachs), war is Business. European Nato members are their puppets. Our culture is closer to the russian than to US. We need no US Imperialism in the name of Rothschilds NWO & his zionistic conspiracy. Boycott & Eliminate Israel
987 2018-04-12 22:08:32 I can't wait to see teachers sabotaging oil infrastructure
988 2018-04-12 22:08:32 I underestimated this utter Bastard,I had him down as a cheap Snake oil salesman. Upgrade that to Hitler please. 
989 2018-04-12 22:08:15 Hmm, the Left said Trump wld start a war.
The US has 16 intel agencies?

Powell & Tony Blair saw WMD in Iraq to pilfer its oil & hung Saddam. Goshhhh. Now, they want ALL of Syria's oil. Killary said 17 foreign intel agencies found tht Trump colluded w/ RU. Nothing. Sick SOBs.

996 2018-04-12 22:07:42 So you obviously don’t believe them when they say they don’t use palm oil derivatives? I hope the founder can convince you otherwise!
997 2018-04-12 22:07:39 I need a oil or dry herb vape ASAP
998 2018-04-12 22:07:37 Got a message from a lady who ordered my oil before going in for surgery. She told me I have her hope. Really gave me chills made my day.
999 2018-04-12 22:07:33 Those states are finally realizing that when tax breaks go to the oil gas and coal , there is NO REINVESTMENT  in jobs or education or infrastructure. It literally goes into a black hole
1000 2018-04-12 22:07:31 Also we don't have a racism problem in NZ, teachers are not living rough, National did a great job, oil is good and the world is flat.
1001 2018-04-12 22:07:29 People probably think a bitch doesn’t shower cause my heads been looking greasy but i swear it’s just this nasty oil for hair growth 
1002 2018-04-12 22:07:22 Then I wish you all the luck in the world. 
I might even get the old oil barrel out myself and grill a few pork chops on Sunday afternoon
1003 2018-04-12 22:07:20 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
1004 2018-04-12 22:07:16 NJ passes two BIG energy bills today: 1. A bill supporting nuclear plants, solar and other clean energy sources; 2. A bill banning offshore oil and gas drilling and infrastructure needed to do it. Wow!
1005 2018-04-12 22:07:09 Now he’s in power he’s in bed with Netanyahu

#Syria. “Cui bono” as the saying goes.  Certainly not Assad.  No, the main beneficiary is #Israel which already illegally occupies #GolanHeights and illegally drills for oil there.
1006 2018-04-12 22:06:59 .Mobile phone is an insane walkietalkie shit..its ruin our brain..our world is a shit today Why ? Heh..Greed War Irak Saddam Oil.. Libya Oil Tunisia ?  Gaddafi..Bush and the J.R..Fuckers both.
1007 2018-04-12 22:06:53 @les1964  I am trying to locate the "Leslie Polson" but I might have the spelling wrong.  They wrote  on a discussion board that their father worked in Columbia for the oil industry with John Funkhouser.  I am researching Funkhouser.  Any chance it it you?
1008 2018-04-12 22:06:51 @LincChalkStream What are your views on potential issues on oil drilling at Biscathorpe?
1009 2018-04-12 22:06:45 We know the mechanism, CO2 traps heat more than other gases in the atmosphere. Higher percentage of CO2 that we generate by burning coal and oil means that atmosphere traps more heat

1014 2018-04-12 22:06:24 Idk what I’d do if kal didn’t change my oil for me.
1015 2018-04-12 22:06:22 Unless DVN can drill 80% oil wells, it's not going anywhere fast. Staying away from anyone who drills for less than 80% oil. Market is taking the value out of the non CL production.

1017 2018-04-12 22:06:13 Build refineries in Canada instead of exporting dirty tar sand oil offshore.

1019 2018-04-12 22:05:48 I'm furious about the NZ govt banning offshore oil exploration. We needed those 11,000 jobs, which out of 5 million people is like 500k jobs in America. It's a tragedy. It will do nothing to reduce carbon emissions by other, much larger countries anyway.
1020 2018-04-12 22:05:38 Just sat for 2 hours and these niggas still ain’t started my oil change. BREH WTF??????

1023 2018-04-12 22:05:25 Borage Seed Oil is probably the richest source of Omega 6 gamma linoleic acid (GLA), that most Americans are found to be deficient in
1024 2018-04-12 22:05:15 I would begin to respect them if they protested against oil in Saudi Arabia.
1025 2018-04-12 22:05:09 Not a word about the gas and oil in Syria
1026 2018-04-12 22:05:05 My birthday list is so sad.

1027 2018-04-12 22:04:53 Am I right in thinking that Assad and Putin are taking control of the country and its oil.Well, that's enough to upset anyone.
1028 2018-04-12 22:04:50 Maybe we can rename it the welfare oil and get all True Canadians to support it.
1029 2018-04-12 22:04:48 It's putting up the price of oil! It's gone up to £70 per barrell - highest for ages.........rise in price of oil in in both US and Russia's interest..........
1030 2018-04-12 22:04:43 @StuartMMeikle  might . Quite shockingly, palm oil is replacing milk fat in our highly prized infant formula
1031 2018-04-12 22:04:42 Beep, boop, beep...our artists used oil pastels and watercolor resist to create the most whimsical robots, don’t ya think?!
1032 2018-04-12 22:04:21 Why is America and the Uk so interested in Syria? Could it be even a little bit about a big gas pipeline to bring fuel to Europe that Assad won’t back? We all remember the invasion of Iraq, the oil fields were secured first #questiontime
1033 2018-04-12 22:04:19 OIL DIFF: 5.19 -> 5.28
1034 2018-04-12 22:04:18 Gosh, it is kind of good to hear you stand against the Trans Pacific Partnership.  Been against it from the beginning and boy do I remember the delays in the vote.
Try taking a stance against Palm Oil.  I rushed a cons choice and found palm oil in it only after finding the taste.
1035 2018-04-12 22:04:17 They should have been more obvious about the Garlic part of the oil okay
1036 2018-04-12 22:04:14 2/2
It's not as though oil and gas extraction will be suddenly stopped from what I read. The announcement is to let those in the industry know it's going to happen. No more licences will be issued is quite different to stopping an industry overnight.
1037 2018-04-12 22:03:36 before you go to bed, apply some lavander essential oil on your temples and chin. it’ll knock u out
1038 2018-04-12 22:03:13 No oil in Syria worth fighting for.
1039 2018-04-12 22:03:12 Cos Saudis are the goodies, remember? They give us all that lovely oil! What’s the last thing you ever got from Yemen?
1040 2018-04-12 22:03:06 #bbcqt Has anyone mentioned the battle to steal Syria's gaslines or their oil fields?
1041 2018-04-12 22:03:02 It would be great if oil painting solvents were safe, I keep thinking of how bob ross died from blood cancer and how it might be related to oil painting, his wife died from the same type of cancer after two years too.
1042 2018-04-12 22:03:02 Maybe Alex Jones can sell his crappy snake oil supplements. He may have to hock his Rolex to do it

1050 2018-04-12 22:02:36 They aren’t interested in holding anyone to account for genocide & war crimes, they want oil & rebuilding contracts, thus faux concern for the Syrians is nauseating #bbcqt
1051 2018-04-12 22:02:35 Start extracting the oil and start a business.

Got d has deposited what you need to make in life inside you
1052 2018-04-12 22:02:34 Putin/Asad regimes can be defeated by increasing oil production by OPEC, resulting in low oil prices, EU stop buying Russian gas, cancel North & South stream gas pipeline project from Russia to Europe. 70% of Russian economy which relies on sale of gas & oil will crumble

1054 2018-04-12 22:02:31 So that's your excuse for selling oil & supplying #ShiaISIS terrorists orgs. Runned by #Iran ?
1055 2018-04-12 22:02:29 I been using the oil for like 4 days and it is growing back so I guess I’ll keep using it

1062 2018-04-12 22:01:14 Oil/gas is the prime driver for all these wars but let’s not forgot Israel’s ambitions as well

#Syria. “Cui bono” as the old saying goes.  Certainly not Assad.  No, the main beneficiary is #Israel which already illegally occupies #GolanHeights and illegally drills for oil there.

1064 2018-04-12 22:01:09 These wars have never had anything to do with humanitarian  cause n everything to do with gas/oil n their pipelines. If the world allows US n it's goons to go ahead with this blatant act of wanton aggression then we can all but forget about any semblance of world order

1082 2018-04-12 21:59:39 amazing. I am curious to know that how you painted and what kind of painting did you use that, acyclic or oil?
1083 2018-04-12 21:59:38 You can look up how to change your own oil yet people charge to change your oil, may I meantion it's very profitable
1084 2018-04-12 21:59:37 This is a great essential oil mix to either sprinkle on your pet or put in an oil diffuser to prevent pet odor:
10 drops lavender essential oil.

6 drops sweet orange oil.

6 drops peppermint essential oil.

3 drops eucalyptus essential oil.

8 ounces of purified water.
1085 2018-04-12 21:59:29 A quick Google would indicate that it is currently a global community of 1. Who else has banned oil exploration?

1094 2018-04-12 21:58:52 I'm just glad I didn't mention that Iran was planning to join the Eurasian Economic Union, Russia and China have a strong economic relationship, China are now trading oil in Yuan. There seems to be an economic divide being mirrored in military rhetoric.

1102 2018-04-12 21:57:26 Wow such snake oil salesmanship you have going here ! Bullshit mountain is getting deep !  
1103 2018-04-12 21:57:13 YOU shouldn't be approving shit. This should be up to experts that do not have a vested interest in the oil industry. You are not an expert.
1104 2018-04-12 21:57:12 Oil and water and food coloring pressed in between glass or plastic! The mix is the key 
1105 2018-04-12 21:57:05 I think that many conflicts are created for reasons of profit. Who always wins in a war? Arms dealers. Oil producers. Money lenders. When a war is fought for moral issues then yes, diplomacy should prevail. War is so primordial, and should have been relegated to history in 1945.

1108 2018-04-12 21:56:36 @JodiePrueitt girl, the Farsali oil is amazing (minus the smell!) 1. If you want dewy makeup you can mix it with your foundation in your beauty blender and it totally works! 2. My face got really earned in Mexico and it was peeling, so I have been putting the oil on my nose
1109 2018-04-12 21:56:30 Liked, RTed & following :)
Thse sound delicious!
1110 2018-04-12 21:56:30 A NZ conservative described banning oil exploration as 'economic vandalism'. Sub prime mortgages and bank bailouts were economic vandalism.
1111 2018-04-12 21:56:23 Let's pray it stays that way. I don't want our boy fighting alongside Al Qaeda for some freaking oil pipeline for the elites.
1112 2018-04-12 21:56:14 The @DNC DEEPSTATE Tax Thieves/UN/EU want to topple Syria as much to destroy Christians as to grab power for global control with isis style tyranny in the area to appease their paid for terrorist muslims.. along with the Oil, water & strip mining the resources for $
1113 2018-04-12 21:55:59 Let's face it if there was no oil in the middle east you would just laugh at them wouldn't you
1114 2018-04-12 21:55:49 I didn't receive reply to my first email, so wrote again today. This time rec'd response + an apology. Was advised my letter has been forwarded to one of the founders. I will let you know when I've rec'd their letter. I also rec;'d a returns label. I will post the palm oil names

1121 2018-04-12 21:55:25 #bbcqt Is there any oil in Syria, can't remember.
1122 2018-04-12 21:55:23 Nigeria remains Africa's largest producer of palm oil.

1124 2018-04-12 21:55:18 A year ago, I brought my company truck in for an oil change and my company didn't pay me for my time, so now it's 9k miles past due on it's next oil change. I'm so childish.

1129 2018-04-12 21:55:09 I agree, and that's why large corporations like oil companies should not receive billions of dollars in subsidies when their already making billions in profits!
1130 2018-04-12 21:54:54 Lmfao yess I’ll be over right  after my oil change ! Be ready for me
1131 2018-04-12 21:54:52 @juliemason Pruitt wants to change the EPA logo to an oil well.
1132 2018-04-12 21:54:49 @PnPCBC Do you know what constitutes a successful oil clean up? 8%. And this is diluted bitumen not oil! Do you peple read stuff or do you just drink each other's bath-water
1133 2018-04-12 21:54:46 Your oil price updates seem to have become less frequent @blairmcdougall ???
1134 2018-04-12 21:54:36 Genie Oil & Gas are the ones pushing this, look for the main investors.
1135 2018-04-12 21:54:20 I’m so impatient , my phones bout to die && I gotta wait 45 min for this oil change on my car 
1136 2018-04-12 21:54:17 @AJWVictoriaBC @PnPCBC @CBCNews @premierofbc @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @ElizabethMay @RachelNotley  Premier Notley I ask the PM if he & his Cabinet would publish oil companies stocked owned . Will you & cabinet do same
1137 2018-04-12 21:54:08 @PnPCBC Stock talks about refined oil. Isn't it bitumen that would be piped through? A refinery in Alberta and then ship would make sense wouldn't it?
1138 2018-04-12 21:54:07 ???
Why? I thought you guys were oil rich (hence the pipe line).
1139 2018-04-12 21:53:56 Exactly. Funny how the media is reporting it as crude oil and the Canadian dollar as to why though...
1140 2018-04-12 21:53:52 Naw, the crooks in the WH, in drugs, in oil, in coal, in everything awful - have cooked their own geese and now they gotta eat em. #FlavoredWithBenzene

1146 2018-04-12 21:53:32 Who are you going to fool with this? Its your country and your allies who sells all kind of weapons to others. The result is as you can see Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and many others countries, are you going for Oil?
1147 2018-04-12 21:53:29 Make them pay with their oil. Great Job MR President. It’s your call and your call only, if there  is doubt , we can wait . One thing 4 sure , they know you will when U must, 58 tomahawks still smoking from a year ago. WE R BEHIND U NO MATTER WHAT. We have your BACK. MAGA

1154 2018-04-12 21:52:22 I love my CBD oil I have been diagnosed with epilepsy migraines and severe anxiety I use CBD daily and I am on NO meds for any treatment truth has set me free from BIG PHARMACY
1155 2018-04-12 21:52:18 Oil pens all the way. 
1156 2018-04-12 21:52:11 Stay out of Syria and clean up that oil spill in Dakota.
1157 2018-04-12 21:52:07 No province will cede power over their natural resources to a federal government of any stripe, currently only 3 have major oil resources, why would they let 7 other provinces decide their fate?
1158 2018-04-12 21:52:05 Just Google the make/model/year of your car plus where to find the oil pan, grab an old milk jug or something big like that, drain 'er and fill it up, you should be able to find the exact amount it needs in the manual or online, it's easy
1159 2018-04-12 21:52:04 I was hoping to do some car work this weekend (oil change) since it's supposed to be nice.... But life always gives me repairs to do!
The garbage men left the can on the edge of the driveway and I hit it against the front bumper when coming out. Now I have paint correction to do!
1160 2018-04-12 21:52:00 It comes down to pipelines, look up Genie Oil & Gas and see who the main investors in the corp are, then it becomes crystal clear.
1161 2018-04-12 21:51:51 Didn’t think before rubbing the ‘beef’ scented oil from the roastery’s aroma sensory kit between my fingers and shortly after hopping on the light rail. #wheresthebeef #phxpublictransit

1164 2018-04-12 21:51:01 Hey!!! enough of this lopsided news!!!
We the people want a clear discussion about less oil and OUR money going into a sustainable economy based on clean energy, such as Geothermal, solar and Tidal!!!
NOT MORE DIRTY FUEL PROJECTS!
Global BS is more like it, you hacks!
1165 2018-04-12 21:50:58 It's to do with the water content, waxes and other things.
This varies from the different types of olive and regions.
I use a ROYAL type olive Oliveira
For high heat cooking and even frying
1166 2018-04-12 21:50:18 @realDonaldTrump #MadMaggieMay @theresa_may @EmmanuelMacron think it is more imoportant to start #WW3 because #SaudiPeakOil was in 2006 so they need to steal @Presidency_Sy & @PutinRF_Eng's Oil
1167 2018-04-12 21:50:16 It should have the oil pan right under the engine, but also since your car is TT you probably have a pretty massive fuggin oil pan to help cool those turbos lol, idk how many miles ya got but on my Volvo I use synthetic Valvoline high mileage
1168 2018-04-12 21:50:11 Oil rights, Gas Pipeline access, Mercenary Contracts, Security contracts, Rebuilding Contracts, Training contracts, other natural resources, a new country to tie to a system of debt and a new market for the west to exploit.
1169 2018-04-12 21:50:09 It actually makes sense... real mayo does, not miracle whip... the egg would give it a good crisp crust, the oil would work the nonstick like butter does.... I just heard of this being a thing, never tried it.... but it makes sense
1170 2018-04-12 21:50:03 Free thinkers will always seem crazy to those who remain within the limitations of logic. Divine, light an oil lamp.
1171 2018-04-12 21:49:57 Hi do you see any chance of oil pullback
1172 2018-04-12 21:49:55 Humidifier with eucalyptus oil is my life saver
1173 2018-04-12 21:49:46 @PnPCBC Stock! You are lying. NEB never looked at marine oil spills. What BS
1174 2018-04-12 21:49:25 I also need a car that belches out smoke and oil at the touch of a button instead of just when it feels like it

1176 2018-04-12 21:49:14 Sorry to hear! That is from the food with high glichemic index. And probably lots of products from the milk industry. If you are vegan you should eat only salads, a lot, and oil seeds. Paleo diet. By Dr. Mercola
1177 2018-04-12 21:49:09 “There’s always oil in your engine”
1178 2018-04-12 21:48:49 The issue IMO is not going to be Treasuries, initially. It will be gold availability constriction & slowing of physical oil as supply, at the margin, is restricted. Treasuries can be gamed. Not so easy to conjure physical oil & gold on a rolling basis. #PetroGold
1179 2018-04-12 21:48:30 Assad Fights to Free his people from ISIS and Zionist Control, the US does it for oil and to spread Rothschild Central Banking and Zionist Control to the region.

1183 2018-04-12 21:48:08 the mining that goes on to make the batteries and the oil based resins to make the boat ...
1184 2018-04-12 21:48:06 We’re going into Syria to steal the oil and gas reserves. #bbcqt
1185 2018-04-12 21:48:06 literally the only death they found was "unpreventable" was the oil well worker who got washed away in a flash flood
1186 2018-04-12 21:48:01 The guy at Graham Tire asked me if I was "sure" I wanted to get my oil changed tomorrow due to the impending storm. Yes, sir, I'm sure I can drive across town in a blizzard 
1187 2018-04-12 21:47:48 For comparison, the cod collapse put 40,000 people out of work - in a single day!

So yes, I do expect oil to collapse overnight. We survived, so will you.

Move on.
1188 2018-04-12 21:47:44 I can zip ur ass? How about that?  No way to caca or fuck? Who want challenge me? Try me) i wait for world wake up just? I have super oil for us ass art

1190 2018-04-12 21:47:33 We use waste oil to shine up our cart tires and seats...it is very economic and lasts a long time...I recommend two coats for your seat to give it that sheen you deserve
1191 2018-04-12 21:47:14 Maybe we need to invest in ourselves and refine our oil here and retain those jobs in Canada and pass the savings onto Canadians. Why isn't anyone asking why we don't refine our products here?
1192 2018-04-12 21:47:11 I saw ! Imma jus get the one from target lmao imagine being in the sun with all that baby oil on u
1193 2018-04-12 21:47:10 Boy did I ask for your CV? Oil company online LMAO. Like I said go into hiding. They coming for your ass log off 
1194 2018-04-12 21:47:10 based on the description, oil would def help that hair type, but also i'm pretty sure that hair type gets even more damaged by shit like dyeing? sO
1195 2018-04-12 21:47:00 My nose is a groundnut oil factory.
1196 2018-04-12 21:46:37 POTUS was handed a steaming pile of dog  and he s dealing with it. BO wouldn’t let ISIS oil tankers ( their operating ) be bombed.
1197 2018-04-12 21:46:35 Im just so damn tired of big pharma. Just ordered some cbd oil for my depression & anxiety. 
1198 2018-04-12 21:46:31 Waited at the garage for 2 hours. They come back tell me they just did the oil change, but my brakes are dangerous and the soonest they can get me in is...Tuesday. Yeah. No. Just called another garage and made an appointment. Fuck. That. Noise.
1199 2018-04-12 21:46:25 I would like to wrestle in baby oil with another bottom, and see who inserts who’s dick first.
1200 2018-04-12 21:46:23 Because there is no oil in South Africa?
1201 2018-04-12 21:46:12 @SteveMolk I'd so love to see Titmus Dad cam, converted into Stokes cam. It'd be a interesting look to see if he did burn the midnight oil last night in a GC hotel re. cricket...
1202 2018-04-12 21:46:07 Maybe try coconut oil next time.
1203 2018-04-12 21:46:01 New Zealand is as much exposed to international commodity prices as oil producing countries are, except we don’t have an OPEC vehicle to protect us. The future for developed agricultural producers is safe, high quality food that generates a price premium, not protectionism.
1204 2018-04-12 21:45:59 New regular posters and blacklight posters are in! Also got in our shipment of lamps and oil! More stuff on the way! See y'all soon!

1206 2018-04-12 21:45:53 Haha, I went to change my oil, but assume as you will. You, along with many others, will blow wind all day long. Its just hot air. I will listen to those that are laying the bricks and doing the work in this war

1208 2018-04-12 21:45:46 Mix 11 lbs celery with 9 tsps dumplings. Mix in Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve
1209 2018-04-12 21:45:43 Yes they are. Because all of them benefit. The people who do NOT benefit are the tax payers. We are the ones paying for it all. Big oil, the greens, governments et Al - they all have a vested interest in climate change. Wake up!
1210 2018-04-12 21:45:33 It's a well-oiled machine over there.  A well-oiled machine that's constantly on fire because of all the oil.
1211 2018-04-12 21:45:30 Since the time sanctions were imposed, russia and china increased their trading especially in oil through transactions nominated in rouble and yuan so shouldn’t these transactions have strengthened the rouble unless china/ russia returned currently to exchanging trade in US$?

1215 2018-04-12 21:45:18 @TheFive 
CBD oil derived from the cannabis plant has near zero THC therefore no high. McConnel introduced a bill to remove hemp from the list of class 1 drugs.

1216 2018-04-12 21:45:15 Yes but won't this push the oil price up?
1217 2018-04-12 21:45:10 Oil, a material thing is given to Banyas so that they toil, work their ass off to build infrastructure, economy. whereas you are meant to rule over these banyas that's why 'roohani power' is being invested in you. But you're wasting it over 'baes' in your bunker
1218 2018-04-12 21:45:09 Correct. As so many around him also exhibit. Nothing new about selling snake oil.

1220 2018-04-12 21:44:41 I want to apologize to all my friends out in Oil City. My van is officially done for and I will not be able to make it tonight. On that note if anyone has any leads on vans for sale please let me know. I refuse to miss another gig
1221 2018-04-12 21:44:28 Besides, the sky has fallen. And that happened after giving the oil company everything they wanted.
1222 2018-04-12 21:44:24 Welp the oil field is boomin again and now there’s higher taxes on oil so start saving up gas money y’all 
1223 2018-04-12 21:44:21 I had such a productive day today. Woke up at 6:30, ate breakfast, went to the gym, came home and showered, went and got my hair cut, went and got my oil changed while I grocery shopped, had a counseling session and now here I sit at work.
1224 2018-04-12 21:44:00 Brussels destroyed it all and won’t stop till the last fisherman is crushed. They need the sea for windmills and oil/gas rigs
1225 2018-04-12 21:43:58 Definitely not correct
1226 2018-04-12 21:43:55 @RachelNotley Fuck you and your oil pipe. Wanna make $$, build a refinery. Stay outta BC. Go pollute your own province.

1229 2018-04-12 21:43:47 It goes right back to WW2 when UK & USA carved up the middle east for the oil rights through coup in Iran to all the current conflicts it all sick. Especially when said politicians wring their hands pretending innocence #NotInMyNameTheresaMay

1233 2018-04-12 21:43:24 Sweet oil is a great idea. Leave it in the bottle, and warm it up in a hot water bath in a small bowl.
1234 2018-04-12 21:43:21 Works great for ships and planes, yes? Battery powered tanks also come to mind. EVs run mostly on coal and gas, btw.
You know, you and your green kind should figure out that electricity is a very small part of oil use and that society CANNOT function without oil.
Period.

1236 2018-04-12 21:43:10 Recently I started using Neutrogena oil free acne wash and I use witch hazel as a toner then I mosturize. So far, it has controlled my oil production as long as I mosturize properly. I'm less oily these days.
1237 2018-04-12 21:43:05 y'all. argan or castor oil. I'm telling you.

1241 2018-04-12 21:42:33 If we're drug testing those receiving federal aid, then we need to drug test oil company execs and one percenters getting huge tax cuts too.

1243 2018-04-12 21:42:25 Please do some important work instead of carrying water for oil companies. Look out for your citizens instead.

1244 2018-04-12 21:42:19 In Australia we only have access legally to the oil. Could you avoid the cooking process by simply using the extract mixed with coconut oil?

1246 2018-04-12 21:42:15 @proctor_jason Hello. As a non player on the financial side - no KM shares - one q that never gets asked is how many oil ships in BC waters annually and how many incidents are there each year? Are we worried about a problem that doesn’t exist?
1247 2018-04-12 21:42:10 The incremental increase in total traffic through Haro Strait due to the TMX expansion is certainly not "7-fold". FYI, VLCC tankers (Carrying 2,000,000 barrels of oil each have been calling on Anacortes just south of Haro Strait to the tune 1/day for 40 years. END
1248 2018-04-12 21:41:56 Agreed!

White pants with the gun tucked up front? Your asking for dirt and oil to stain those pants. I would have gone with denim.

1265 2018-04-12 21:40:36 The small amount of oil supply from NZ will have zero impact on oil prices. Supply will just move elsewhere and likely to a place with lower environmental standards than NZ.
1266 2018-04-12 21:40:34 Do not forget the hot bread shops and takeaway outlets where oil and gas employees buy their lunches. We have long raised our eyebrows at the figures quoted by the industry.

1273 2018-04-12 21:40:01 This is why they want to go to war! We have so many people from the DoD & private contractors over there nobody ever ask why? The reason is the oil/liquefied natural gas.

I'm sure you're equally outraged at them, right? I mean, they make BILLIONS annually, way more than Gore.
1295 2018-04-12 21:37:47 Took a drive out of the city and it was nice seeing all the new construction for all the Oil companies out there taking place, polluting everything on my dime, while my kids school begs for a new text book or two and told to fuck off by the GOP.

1345 2018-04-12 21:32:49 Thought we talking about the pipeline? I understand that you understand that many of the things you own comes from oil a natural organic product that comes from the very Mother Nature you are talking about, guess we shouldn’t put out naturally cause forest fires and let them burn
1346 2018-04-12 21:32:46 @GovernorTomWolf Sir, the underground oil or gas in PA does NOT belong to the 'people'  of PA.  That oil, sir, belongs only to the people that own the ground or the people that own the rights to same, not the 'people' in general.  One more reason not to vote for you.

1351 2018-04-12 21:32:06 Strain out material, leaving water and oil. I use a plastic water pitcher so I can put it in the fridge. Once it cools in the fridge the oil will rise to the top and harden to a solid slab. You can then take the slab out and discard the water. Clean the bottom of slab of debris

1356 2018-04-12 21:31:35 Yes in the 60s and 70s. We were saved by three things; North Sea Oil, EU membership (esp single market) and the first term Thatcher reforms. Impossible to rank them as to importance, but all helped.
1357 2018-04-12 21:31:32 #ConfidenceinCanada
If we truly need the pipeline then let's do it but we need to ensure we don't rely on it. Instead of powering everything with oil let's begin to power estetal thing(hospitals, police stations, fires house, etc) with renewable energy.

1361 2018-04-12 21:31:03 Hope that helps. Non-heated forms of extracts (tinctures, oils) will result in the collection of THCA. Because it is harder to collect, THCA oil vs.THC oil is often times more expensive

1366 2018-04-12 21:30:28 Exactly. Japanese news just covered the effect on Asian oil markets of the Syria-Russia double threat. And it was more than a small ripple.

1374 2018-04-12 21:30:02 Every leftist or liberal who believes in climate change or protecting our environment from pollution should support nuclear power, every conservative or libertarian who believes in securing America by ending our dependence on foreign oil should support nuclear power...
1375 2018-04-12 21:30:01 Put just a little bit of saliva oil tweenst that thumb and index finger and you good.
1376 2018-04-12 21:30:01 Cool. A low paying dead industry is back while the rest of the world creates thousands of jobs & moves ahead of the US and into the future with renewable energy.

But good for the big oil special interests!
1377 2018-04-12 21:29:58 This is so 2015, but coconut oil has literally saved my life #amen
1378 2018-04-12 21:29:57 Surprised herrera dint slide with the amount of oil in that badge LMAO
1379 2018-04-12 21:29:53 Oh I’m definitely doing it. I got my baby oil ready lol. I’ve been wanting to do it for a while actually but now that it’s “popular” rn I’m back on it.
1380 2018-04-12 21:29:44 Greatest Royal Rumble card being formulated by someone who clearly is building and simulating the most ludicrous WWE2K18 card Middle East oil money can make. Lmao.
1381 2018-04-12 21:29:41 My opinion ...is the deal between first Bush and Saudi’s set that in motion.. it was deal between devils..the greed between oil and power.. we shouldn’t even be using oil anymore but big oil corporations who bought and paid for both Bushes wanted that badly..it makes me cry
1382 2018-04-12 21:29:34 Absolutely although if you think that Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, Dubai et al are all rolling in it then you’ll be surprised by the poverty in all the Oil states. I worked in Yemen ten years ago. Lovely people kept poor by religion,oppression and multi nationals robbing their resources.
1383 2018-04-12 21:29:30 Oil is oil. It works wonderfully.
1384 2018-04-12 21:29:28 Thankful for the other little guys.
1385 2018-04-12 21:29:14 Listening to @RNZ and dying of laughter at Oil & Gas bosses saying they were 'blindsided' by yesterdays announcement - where the hell do they think world is going?? #endoil #nzpol
1386 2018-04-12 21:29:13 BC needs to take a stand as well, as there are many supporters of the pipeline/oil/gas and people are angry that the NDP are even in power considering the damage to the economy they did the last time they were in. #neverNDP #neverliberal if you want to keep your pay check
1387 2018-04-12 21:29:08 FFS, imagine going to war with a country just to steal oil to inflate the ! #Syria #TrumpsaCunt #TeamPutin
1388 2018-04-12 21:29:02 #Syria Assad has won the war & US/UK et al have lost their illegal attempt at regime change & the #Oil & #Gas.
I know folks; let's bomb his country after a false, chemical attack & wipe the smile off his face. Sod the Syrian pop.
1389 2018-04-12 21:28:56 Why can’t I just get an oil change without them telling me my car is about to explode and it’ll cost $5,000,000 to fix?
1390 2018-04-12 21:28:54 The Arab oil $$ controlling the UNHRC will do nothing because it's all a sham
1391 2018-04-12 21:28:45 Yet, here we have New Zealand stopping oil and gas exploration permits.
1392 2018-04-12 21:28:45 @jimcarr_wpg was asked by @simisara980 What is the spill response? He only said a dollar figure $1.5 billion. Does he mean we throw $$$ on the oil spill to clean up? @JonathanWNV Explain? @steeletalk @CKNW #bcpoli #cndpoli
1393 2018-04-12 21:28:30 Kirkuk, has ONLY just been recaptured by Iraq troops from the Kurds. This oil-rich region has been unstable for years.  The Americans NEED the oil, as do the Russians.  You are right about "other interests are overlaid" but these are mere happy corollaries to the capitalists.
1394 2018-04-12 21:28:27 I want to start oil painting again :)
1395 2018-04-12 21:28:25 I agree. How we deal with those involved in oil & gas & their communities is vital tho. Part of the reason for Brexit & Trump is that Communities felt left behind.  Do need to assist regions affected w the transition @Jamienzherald @rg_jones @akinafoundation @CubaRaglanGuy
1396 2018-04-12 21:28:19 Recipe: Equal parts water, coconut oil and plant material. Add to crock pot and cook at 200-300 deg. for 1-4 days. The longer the stronger. Add water throughout to keep a soupy consistency, stir occasionally. While still warm strain all the material out. 1/2
1397 2018-04-12 21:28:18 Remember this is kinder Morgan building the pipeline not the government (for now). Oil is starting to revive the low Canadian dollar as well. This is great move right now for Canada.
1398 2018-04-12 21:28:17 Why Assad would want to use chemical weapons when He had already won the war? fake story to (try) to get the hand on a lot of oil and money. However the problem is that this time there is military Russia in the middle est..
1399 2018-04-12 21:28:12 No chemo! Juice and CBD oil. And absolutely no sugar.
1400 2018-04-12 21:27:59 I have an attitude. My road rage is high. I just want this good oil change so I can take my ass home.
1401 2018-04-12 21:27:58 本垢の10連が毎日クズ１０しか出さない呪いにかかっておる･･･（おはよ）
1402 2018-04-12 21:27:56 Bashar out of the way simply means cheaper oil from the Gulf and no dependency on Russia. I see the Gulf betraying the US and joining sides with Russia as more realistic than a fall of Assad - who isn't and hasn't even been in Syria for a week and a half now lol. Hide and seek.
1403 2018-04-12 21:27:54 Iranian Republican Guard clearing the oil fields of Iraq are why Daesh left Syria.
1404 2018-04-12 21:27:45 Then serve all of the American people! Not just your rich white friends and oil buddies.
1405 2018-04-12 21:27:44 Give it 10 years and #Assad has resumed full control of his country, oil and Gas. These #Tory  scumbags will be sucking up to him big time, just to make a few quid! This has nothing to do with chemical weapons and everything about #Russia making a few bob more than them! #Syria
1406 2018-04-12 21:27:40 I am just a fan of tuna with olive oil tomatos mozarella salad and balsamico oil

1408 2018-04-12 21:27:27 You are not a big consumer of Oklahoma media, apparently.
Missed the stories of his signing letters to the EPA penned by oil company mouthpieces, did you? What about his state Email woes? We all knew about that when he was appointed.
1409 2018-04-12 21:27:21 The wheel that squeaks the loudest gets the oil is the bad and self defeating politics that got us in this prejudicial mess.  Be fair and just with equality for all and we will make our nation great as it was intended to be.   You are not responsible for the mess. Don't keep it.
1410 2018-04-12 21:27:18 I don’t do mayonnaise, (egg whites & oil) I am Jewish and like my mustard! Mayo works really good on grilled cheese in place of margarine!
1411 2018-04-12 21:27:03 Jim "Carrdboard" Carr is just a paper effigy of himself. He's a waste of rations and that's why Junior put him there. The driving force in that dept is his chief-of-staff, Zoe Caron, egregious oil and pipeline hater who co-authored a book with Liz May on the topic.
1412 2018-04-12 21:27:03 The thing is baby oil magnifies the sun and you'll get so effin sunburned from it.
1413 2018-04-12 21:26:59 Billions of people marched against the Iraq war around the world but no one listened because the gas and oil is worth more than human blood to these people.
1414 2018-04-12 21:26:54 AMERICA IS NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON MIDDLE EAST OIL. YOU'LL FIND THAT OUT SOON
1415 2018-04-12 21:26:42 Not to say we should not also work on developing other energy sources, but the worlds desire for oil and oil based products is not going away any time soon.
1416 2018-04-12 21:26:42 it did. I only had olive oil though so they were fancy.
1417 2018-04-12 21:26:37 Filled my car up already because whatever happens the oil market & retailers find a reason to hike the price!

1420 2018-04-12 21:26:31 Massive opium epidemic in America and you still think the last invasion was about oil?
1421 2018-04-12 21:26:29 No, it does have a lot to do with genocide. Cooperating with Saudi Arabia for oil and arms deals, which leads to Yemen being hurt, is irresponsible and leads to the Middle East wanting to attack us more.
1422 2018-04-12 21:26:25 It is the CBN that implements and executes policies and instruments that control inflation, not the people who do not even know the price of petrol!!!
And sign oil contracts after handing over!!!
1423 2018-04-12 21:26:10 I've got my peanut butter and my coconut oil ready.

One is for fixing aim and the other is for making the buttons respond quicker.
Every second counts.
1424 2018-04-12 21:25:55 I attempted to make stove top popcorn but I forgot about it so the kernels burned and when I took off the lid, all this smoke came out and then the oil in my pan started on fire. Going back to my microwave popcorn, goddamnit 
1425 2018-04-12 21:25:51 We stand with Saudi Arabia for their OIL.  Would you rather buy oil from the only other oil-rich nation? Because that would be Russia. 
Don’t worry, once the oil dries up we will end our relationship and you can adjust your moral compass accordingly.
1426 2018-04-12 21:25:44 I exfoliate with a coffee scrub and then use the bio oil
1427 2018-04-12 21:25:44 My my. You have gone full Venezuela. I can see many similarities between the UK economy and that of the oil dependent South American regime.
1428 2018-04-12 21:25:43 Mine was Pickens. After the Texas oil man, Boone Pickens.
1429 2018-04-12 21:25:29 Ok, not an expert on the specific uses of the oil we pump out of the ground here, vs the oil we get from elsewhere.

Irrespective of that, *carbon that stays in the ground doesn’t contribute to climate change*.

Economics will let you carve out a particular sub-system...
1430 2018-04-12 21:25:27 if you gonna make a diy shimmer oil i recommend jojoba oil
1431 2018-04-12 21:25:22 “EPA is hiding behind poor excuses about proprietary business information to shield big oil companies from public scrutiny” - GOP senators wrote

I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
1433 2018-04-12 21:25:07 I love to do commissions for people, but please like take into account that just because I do art does not mean I can magically produce whatever comes to mind - eg if you want a high quality oil pastel then I'm not the guy
1434 2018-04-12 21:25:01 Haha, how'd you miss that we were environmental engineers?!? Sometimes I cringe when I get lumped in with all engineers, we're a bit different than what people picture  Mostly covered in a little more manure, oil, mud, etc.
1435 2018-04-12 21:25:00 Lol they brought up good points about not using baby oil lol maybe almond oil
1436 2018-04-12 21:24:48 I certainly agree with 2 and 3. Please help me out on the oil dependence?
1437 2018-04-12 21:24:48 I like to toss it in oil and throw it in the oven for ten minutes.
1438 2018-04-12 21:24:46 Where was the robust response in Yugoslavia in the 90s, sorry that was just olive oil
1439 2018-04-12 21:24:40 Why am I just barely using tea tree oil?! This stuff is amazing!
1440 2018-04-12 21:24:36 Congratulations to another leader in the oil industry. Stepping our to use creative thought is rewarding.  “Spike Lee's Blackkklansman is among the top contenders at Cannes ” @Oprah @common @Tylerperry @common @diddy @ty@https://twitter.com/i/moments/984409987559673857

1443 2018-04-12 21:24:17 That is the plan Trump has for us. Except no offshore oil rigs in Florida....Mar-a-Lago won’t have to view those ugly oil rigs...
1444 2018-04-12 21:24:06 My Grandmother always used a few drops of sweet oil for earaches. Seemed to work for me when i was a child. I havent used it as an adult. Hope you feel better soon!
1445 2018-04-12 21:24:04 Lol it’s not only palm oil
1446 2018-04-12 21:24:03 Peppermint oil works wonders.
1447 2018-04-12 21:23:56 Right you are!
1448 2018-04-12 21:23:52 One day I hope to have a website but it is simple and found online but here is my take on it. I prefer coconut oil (it is solid at room temp) because you can eat it as is, cook with it, and use it topically. It is good for pain, rashes, burns... I use it for everything.
1449 2018-04-12 21:23:52 As a Marxist,I'm actually finding many more allies on the right and so-called extreme right these days!The left by and large is the force of neo-liberalism with some gender equality snake oil to deflect from people looking too closely at their agenda thrown in.
1450 2018-04-12 21:23:49 Plus you have the same hypocrites saying we shouldn't be exporting crude oil / bitumen, should be refined here but of course only in Alberta - funny how they don't say same about raw logs exported to China and not using coal in BC?
1451 2018-04-12 21:23:48 If you are a real man of the true and living God, the creator, you know that war for oil is not Yeshua's MO.
1452 2018-04-12 21:23:44 The Russians have been given control of the Syrian Banias Oil Terminal. Now you know why the USA, UK Government Psychopaths are angry...#oilprice #oil Russia Baniyas

1459 2018-04-12 21:23:04 If the PM appearing on Beehive steps to accept a petition saying 'end oil exploration now' and then says the government is 'actively considering the issue' isn't a clear enough sign that a ban was coming then people need to go back to Read the Signs School.
1460 2018-04-12 21:22:55 USA is animal! You stole country from Indians, send black people to fight against yellow people! Why? World peace or world oil? Stop playing games. You're hidding your ass in the oval room. Soldiers must risk their life. For what? For your ignorance? Think of that!

1465 2018-04-12 21:22:28 Is it APC that increased the price of crude oil internationally?
Is it APC frugal policies and unprecedented loan taking and the approval
to take $1bn dollars to fight BKH that increased foreign reserved?
Deduct SUKUK loan from foreign reserve and give us the balance!
1466 2018-04-12 21:22:17 I've been using fish oil capsules and... they... actually... seem to do something...? 
1467 2018-04-12 21:21:57 What's all the nonsense from environmentalists about not mining oil? We are just going to buy it off someone else instead.The difference we make to  climate change doing that is?
1468 2018-04-12 21:21:52 We have to stop this thing because we’re just going to be giving our natural resources away to some foreign country for nothing making big oil richer and governments more wealthy
1469 2018-04-12 21:21:44 I hate myself. I just took 7 different buzzfeed quizzes instead of doing my homework.

In longer term QE will drive inflation, the weak pound will drive up price of imports, so food, oil, gas, and economy will weaken further...

1488 2018-04-12 21:19:40 Is this an oil? I am afraid it wouldn't work well with oily skin.
1489 2018-04-12 21:19:37 Big clues that meant I, not in oil&gas industry, was not “shocked & blindsided” by end to offshore exploration: Leader of Labour Party saying climate change is this generation’s nuclear-free moment; Labour going into govt with Greens.
1490 2018-04-12 21:19:37 He is in Dubai,  same place as Dawood Ibrahim.

He is kissing up to the oil rich Muslims in Arabia but scolding Sania in India. #Hypocracy and very non Indian
1491 2018-04-12 21:19:37 Been hearing good things about CBD oil. It doesn’t contain THC which is good since I do not currently have access to flower or other forms of THC, and still would like a cannabis-infused treatment for my anxiety and depression
1492 2018-04-12 21:19:25 Hence my suggestion FIA have only demonstrated incompetence in accident investigation. They should bring in Aviation or Oil investigators for the analytical expertise needed for root causes and solutions.  They've already failed 2 or 3 or 4 times! See TR!
1493 2018-04-12 21:19:24 I hate oil changes. No offense, but they pressure you to buy a bunch of stuff and I JUST WANT AN OIL CHANGE 
1494 2018-04-12 21:19:22 It’s been the American policy for so many years. You know why? Well first the natural resources, Syria’s a lot of natural gas and oil. Second the WAR is a good business for the US. They start wars then when those countries are in conflict, Americans sell their guns, tanks etc.
1495 2018-04-12 21:19:20 There is no VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY in #Syria Read between ur lines its all about #Assad hes #Sunni outspoken critic of US prefers Russia/Iran/China. This is leftover Obama/Clintonian Amateur Hour Statesmanship. Maybe its Oil Reserves or #Monsanto wants control of Syrian Wheat
1496 2018-04-12 21:19:06 Agreed that dilbit is quite volatile, though there are very volatile crudes (such as the Bakken oil that destroyed Lac Megantic), but Alaskan crudes are also quite volatile, which is why Exxon at first just wanted to let the oil in Prince William Sound evaporate.
1497 2018-04-12 21:19:06 Okay it’s a lil splash of toasted sesame oil and then a liberal amount of soy sauce and hot sauce. Do you have an air popper? Best $20 I’ve ever spent!!

1500 2018-04-12 21:18:56 Everyone knows that oil is not a future business, but Norway has built it's fortune on that. So we needed to come up with a new solid fiscal plan, so we are now going to charge a license fee from trolls. And we'll make a killing. Thanks, internet!
1501 2018-04-12 21:18:51 Right.  Canada is such a hotbed of political corruption, dissension & militaristic values.  Unlike Saudi Arabia, UAE, Venezuela & most of the other oil producing nations
1502 2018-04-12 21:18:49 Ur no oil painting girl - that filter still doesnt do u any favours! As for ur personality - absolute trash attacking a father that is suffering!!
1503 2018-04-12 21:18:47 How to get longer eyelashes and thicker eyebrows: Every night before bed I put castor oil on my lash line and my brows and my lashes have grown so long and my brows getting thicker ( brows seem to take longer to see progress) it’s been 3 weeks 
1504 2018-04-12 21:18:39 I was thinking of just trying the oil in the droplet bottles
1505 2018-04-12 21:18:07 A gallon and a half of lemon and ginger tea for my throat 
Wrapped (more like stuck) in my duvet 
Alarm at 5.45 
Lavender oil all over my pillow 

Time to go to sl-
1506 2018-04-12 21:18:05 Unless that oil well doesn't have proven reserves in large commercial quantities you might loose that bet.
1507 2018-04-12 21:17:59 As more countries legalized MMJ, Canada’s cannabis oil exports rise 300% in 2017 over the previous year. Germany is leading in this over all other countries.

1509 2018-04-12 21:17:38 An hour homie. But I gotta take my car to the auto center real quick for an oil change
1510 2018-04-12 21:17:38 Yeah, I bought it with a vape pen that came with cartridges. Then I bought a regular vape and the oil. I preferred that cartridges but they stopped selling it
1511 2018-04-12 21:17:33 It has already happened when Putin's cook wanted to get an oil refinery in Syria.
1512 2018-04-12 21:17:33 API Downstream Group Director Frank Macchiarola said EPA doesn't have legal authority to grant an E15 RVP waiver. Macchiarola said the oil industry "plans to consider all options to prevent such a waiver" and believes legislation is needed to fix what he called the "broken" RFS.

1516 2018-04-12 21:17:12 Now oil up.
1517 2018-04-12 21:17:00 I am not part of the 0.1% and I want the pipeline built. I understand that if we are not the ones producing oil, states such as Iran, Saudi and Venezuela will. They have a horrible track record for health, safety and human rights. One world, one humanity. #ethicaloil #buildkm

#StopKM
1521 2018-04-12 21:16:24 manufacturing bankers war industry for oil while innocent civilians caught up in crossfire, we been down this road before with Iraq, Libya...what's happened to the #UN #ICC and leadership crimes of agression as a deterrent
1522 2018-04-12 21:16:20 Thanks! The most interesting trend here is that by 2040 natural gas is expected to overtake coal and thus the top three positions will be:
1. Oil
2. Gas
3. Coal
1523 2018-04-12 21:16:19 Beautiful oil?  How about a beautiful BORDER between BC and Alberta?
1524 2018-04-12 21:16:06 Vaseline Petroleum Oil thanks you and the #IfikieWazazi hash tag for promoting it's use...

If you know....you know
1525 2018-04-12 21:15:47 Hahahah what are u selling from #Ghana the west are interested in our oil. Are u giving them that at the summit by contract.
1526 2018-04-12 21:15:47 How is US and Israel any different here?
US had killed millions in Iraq to steal their oil. US bombs and guns are killing civilians in Syria too.
Wish you 've heard the name of a country called Yemen and what US & Saudis are doing to it.
Keep your hypocrisy to yourself.
1527 2018-04-12 21:15:46 Mix 9 tsps gumbo with 8 oz enchilada. Mix into  Olive Oil. Drain. Serve with chili
1528 2018-04-12 21:15:41 I swear @leigh_cox28 is a little kid sometimes. Like today at Walmart when we were waiting for my cars oil to get changed. I thought i was gonna have to bust his ass for being antsy.

1531 2018-04-12 21:15:09 Take daily #fish oil #supplements that provide at least 250-500mg. RT
1532 2018-04-12 21:15:04 Today's Tip!
To get rid of a squeaky door, just rub some petroleum jelly on the hinges. It's not as messy as oil, it works just as well and you probably have it on hand.
1533 2018-04-12 21:14:41 If Alberta blocked goods coming from Bc, cut oil flow to BC it would hurt them. Biggest problem is the lacking leadership in Ottawa. Trudeau off to Peru while these provinces battle. I'm from Ontario as well
1534 2018-04-12 21:14:08 Think about what the Iraq war was really about. Venezuela oil workers go on strike. American refineries lose much crude oil  6 months later US is in Iraq.  Bush's campaign was financed by Texaco.

Do these people care for the children? Of course they bloody don't.
1535 2018-04-12 21:14:08 Climate denier, over-spender, bonus-giver to staff with no budget to give, entitled, in bed with oil companies - not the way it should work I will NOT #StandWithScottPruitt .
1536 2018-04-12 21:14:03 Amen here , here 
1537 2018-04-12 21:13:52 I’m finna change my own oil cause I’m a independent bad ass car fixin bitch 
1538 2018-04-12 21:13:46 Today banks, oil continuation, casinos etc...
1539 2018-04-12 21:13:44 No surprise here! Pruitt is single handily undermining the RFS and supporting his friends at Big Oil.  I was hoping that Pruitt would be hanging out at the unemployment line by now!
1540 2018-04-12 21:13:40 Yeah, he's more bothered about selling all the oil.
1541 2018-04-12 21:13:39 @PnPCBC Guess it's time to ship more oil via rail through BC.
1542 2018-04-12 21:13:33 Because you're a video game enthusiast, right? If I were talking to a car enthusiast and said that I paid someone to change my oil, they'd probably laugh & judge me. Car enthusiasts think changing oil on a car is trivial. It's the same correlation.

1544 2018-04-12 21:13:13 Move towards right direction, we must get it right, now that Tullow Oil swept us through the feet!
1545 2018-04-12 21:13:12 Sweet almond oil* but I ain't trynna spend $10 on a bottle of it I've never had problems with coconut oil surprisingly
1546 2018-04-12 21:13:08 I may be showing political ignorance here but to me it seems that the West are planning to bomb Syria after Syria bombed Syria to show Syria not to bomb Syria. 

Coincidentally another oil rich country 
1547 2018-04-12 21:13:07 Now I am serious asking, What would coconut oil do?
1548 2018-04-12 21:13:04 So I looked into CCL's Team OIL and it's not what I was talking about. 

What I'm proposing: it might be powerful to collect personal testimonials from FF industry workers who are nonetheless concerned about CC. There have to be a bunch!
1549 2018-04-12 21:12:57 No you don't have priviliege. Stop drinking the snake oil for a second; you've been brainwashed into thinking that a priviliege/oppression dynamic is some kind of Pyramid Scheme. Whereby your birth/genetics are a sickness or blessing depending where you are on that pyramid.
1550 2018-04-12 21:12:54 With mtc oil, heavy cream, cheeses & fat bombs it’s easy to ingest too much
1551 2018-04-12 21:12:46 bless you if you think we go to these wars to offer the people of the middle east a better quality of life, we go there for our own agenda, oil, gold and greed. 

Sacrificed our good men and women to feed the greed of Blair and to a lesser extent that pig stuffing Brexit twat Cam
1552 2018-04-12 21:12:43 The girls in my essential oil support group are advising all these blends for allergies and I’m just like, “but have you tried Flonase?”
1553 2018-04-12 21:12:41 Castor oil would be excellent too 
1554 2018-04-12 21:12:31 Oil team got exposed in both legs  go spend another half a billion on a new defense, & get schooled again next year you stupid frauds, you will never be a GREAT FOOTBALL CLUB!
1555 2018-04-12 21:12:14 -anting the usa to get out of Syria
so thus we must ask who gains by us getting into these wars
the arms industry is a clear winner
old generals near retirement wanting to go out in a blaze of past gore
Israel who gained a trillion dollar oil reserve in golin heights it will keep
1556 2018-04-12 21:12:12 This is beautiful, but definitely consider an alternative oil option to baby oil which is synthetic and thus hinders the largest organ of your body to properly function. Thus predisposing you to illness, toxicity. Our skin is permeable, what comes in must come out & vice versa.
1557 2018-04-12 21:12:09 Nah ke hlapile fela  ke be tsasa ka coconut oil
1558 2018-04-12 21:12:05 All I know is her skin is gonna hate her for putting all that oil on mixed with shit....not a good idea sis  Breakouts for days....
1559 2018-04-12 21:11:57 Gotta chapter meeting old boy but make sure that oil fresh my guy lol
1560 2018-04-12 21:11:41 At least chloroform fraction smells like crude oil.....but this one was just gross. xD
1561 2018-04-12 21:11:33 I mean, if you need, I got some baby oil on deck 
1562 2018-04-12 21:11:29 China committed to peaking their CO2 emissions by 2030. They will likely achieve this target a decade ahead of schedule. Canada's effort to meet our emissions targets are being eroded by support for the oil and gas industry, while China leads the world in renewable investment.
1563 2018-04-12 21:11:10 The best part about oil changes is the drink you get to enjoy while you let it drain.
1564 2018-04-12 21:10:52 of course since Vietnam..we've been through so many BLACK-OPS..FBI/CIA COVER-UPS..FDA/CDC..COVER=UPS! POISONING OUR WATER..COAL MINES..OIL POLLUTING OUR OCEANS..NAVAL WASTE IN THE OCEAN..NUCLEAR WASTE..FIBERS IN OUR FISH/BOTTLE WATER..CHEMICAL WAR-FAIR ..CHEM-TRAILS..ETC..US-ARMY
1565 2018-04-12 21:10:46 Ironically stopping it may have a greater effect as more oil will be shipped by train, which both more carbon intensive and much more riskier. 

Anyway, I see where you stand and I do respect that. I support it.
1566 2018-04-12 21:10:36 Unproven. Bad actors everywhere! Why specify/bomb Syria? War machine wants an oil pipeline thru Turkey. Erdogan is no better!
1567 2018-04-12 21:10:33 I have never said we are a shining country. In every country you’ve got issues. But making a comment about muslims immigrating whilst the US is searching for oil... come one. BTW google how isis was formed.  Thats just 
1568 2018-04-12 21:10:29 I always like to say arsenic and crude oil are all natural and organic... should be good to go. Balanced diet right there.
1569 2018-04-12 21:10:22 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
1570 2018-04-12 21:10:21 Mxm, why are the bombarding oil countries that are not under their control, isn't it about competition and collect, I mean you should read about how USA made pipe lines to collect Iraqi oil... They export but it's not all produced in USA, wanted to take Venezuela oil too
1571 2018-04-12 21:10:13 Do you change the oil on your car? Do you grow your own food on a farm instead of buying it at a grocery store? Did you make your furniture on your own?

Those are all things that people provide as a service. It's about time vs effort when you're selecting goods & services.
1572 2018-04-12 21:10:12 Ok if all of this is for oil where is all the oil?
1573 2018-04-12 21:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this April? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1574 2018-04-12 21:10:09 The Deep State = Israel. Reason: Oil and steal the lands to turn them into Greater Israel.

1576 2018-04-12 21:09:50 Why you randomly adding oil into this lol.
1577 2018-04-12 21:09:49 if u have allergies rn use eucalyptus oil!!!!! clears up ur sinuses soo well
1578 2018-04-12 21:09:46 Pero put on hella sunscreen I'd you're gonna use baby oil or you'll burn
1579 2018-04-12 21:09:44 The guy at drive and shine is about to judge the fuck out of me for not having any oil in my car 
1580 2018-04-12 21:09:33 I like my grill cheeses without mayo ain’t nothing wrong with butter no need for egg oil. I get the mechanics of it but still makes me sick
1581 2018-04-12 21:09:29 Wasn't too crazy about it, coconut oil is so good for your skin, body, hair, and I'm gonna art and sew 
1582 2018-04-12 21:09:26 @grecoroyal Solid plan! Did you get an oil changed? Or, you holding off for now?
1583 2018-04-12 21:09:20 Then do a little research vet asaad was happy we announced we were leaving Syria a week ago so let me ask you why would he gas his own people?? It's oil it's been in the works since before 2014 it's all out there big money wants war not trump. This President wants us back to work
1584 2018-04-12 21:09:19 So I replaced the valve cover gasket in my car yesterday, let the sealant cure for 24 hours and I'm about to go start it up. Wish me luck... oh did I mention that I haven't done a valve cover since my 1980 Buick and also that the spark plug wells were filled with oil... 
1585 2018-04-12 21:08:46 Since it takes 0.0016 barrels of oil to produce 1 kWh, an 85 kWh Tesla battery uses 0.136 barrels of oil to fully charge. (85x0.0016) With 42 gal in 1 barrel, it uses 5 gal of oil. A Tesla with an 85 kWh battery has a range of 265 miles. Since 265/5=53, a Tesla gets about 53 MPG.
1586 2018-04-12 21:08:45 There’s no oil in Cuba. 
1587 2018-04-12 21:08:38 No, not yet. I left it sit last summer  because I was so mad. I should order the parts soon and change the oil so when summer actually comes, I can use it. We have a different lawnmower but this one is a lot nicer. Or was.
1588 2018-04-12 21:08:29 Let me uncomplicate it for you. Oil, greed, pipelines, more greed and they want to dissect the country and share its assets between them. Then there's the pipelines they want to lay right through the middle of the country.
1589 2018-04-12 21:08:25 Here’s a solution. Federal Govt buys bitumen at US rate and builds refineriesin Alberta to refine tar to light oil plus extracting vanadium for batteries. Pipeline sends light oil to the Coast and overseas with considerably more profit. @PMJTrudeau @jjhorgan
1590 2018-04-12 21:08:24 By ignoring American Indians in favor or Oil Industry, Giving our children the largest debt since WWII, Gutting EPA in favor of Corporations, Allowing drilling on protected land, Tax cuts that will be paid for by reducing social spending. LOL
1591 2018-04-12 21:08:12 Even Northsound has a Tory or labour view on things happening in north east. Lewis MacDonald on oil jobs and Peter Chapman on AWPR strike. Might be an idea to ask a gov spokesperson
1592 2018-04-12 21:08:10 Oil is “the prize” for #Russia,  also #Syria is prime real estate for them. In addition, having “warm water” ports for their navy, & military bases will enable them, to project their influence.
1593 2018-04-12 21:08:06 You can just apply it as is, or as hot oil treatment. As hot oil treatment yifake in a container and microwave it for a bit, then apply.
1594 2018-04-12 21:07:46 Love the smell of Murphys Oil Soap....
1595 2018-04-12 21:07:19 This place tried to charge me 90.00+ for an oil change lmfao boiii I walked out of there so fast 
1596 2018-04-12 21:07:16 You don't need either!! The grilled cheese has enough oil to compensate any of those two items
1597 2018-04-12 21:06:56 Left my fucking argon oil & face mask at uni I give up
1598 2018-04-12 21:06:52 Oh I don’t doubt that, there will always be people against anything. Facts are there is a silent majority who are for it. Fact is whether or not it proceeds will have no effect on GHG’s. The oil will simply be bought from somewhere else. So you are only against Canadian energy.
1599 2018-04-12 21:06:31 Apple cider vinegar (or any vinegar) on a wash cloth press on sun burn to relieve pain.

Coconut oil- rub all over sun burn let soak in and repeat as many times as possible. Repeat until sunburn is gone

Increase water intake.
1600 2018-04-12 21:06:30 So weird and cool at the sane time how coconut oil just melts in your hands 
1601 2018-04-12 21:06:23 I just opened up my old show box and it smelled like pink oil now I’m emotional
1602 2018-04-12 21:06:15 Damn we already found a way to bootleg that fenty body oil. . . I'm here for it too
1603 2018-04-12 21:06:12 Then in 2003 Al Gore mentions oil imports and gets mocked for thinking you should drive smaller cars instead of killing people.
1604 2018-04-12 21:06:12 That’s what all the oil has paid for! It’s not a bad use and they are going in the right direction!
1605 2018-04-12 21:06:07 All his hard work these 23 years in the oil field have paid off. Thank you  for everything you have done to provide for our family!
1606 2018-04-12 21:05:49 smh. that’s cuz you so anti-mayo. 

but think of it like this. fareal lol. the mayo texture will completely disappear once it hits the heat. it’s mostly oil so it melts-soaks into bread-then makes it that much crispier (not burnt) - like pancake edges
1607 2018-04-12 21:05:48 Syria doesnt have big oil
1608 2018-04-12 21:05:40 You don’t own the coast. It’s Canada’s. What if AB said “our oil” & no transfer payments were made. It’s not about what’s good for BC, it’s about Canada. It’s called being on a team, BC has no concept of that. Just  separate already. It seems like you dont need the rest of Canada
1609 2018-04-12 21:05:30 Dont attack assad and start WW3 with russia over false flags and oil. We need a safe America.
1610 2018-04-12 21:05:29 No  trump was leaving he announced it last week. Obama Hillary ousted ghadafi in Libya armed Isis then in Syria  and we do it now genius read the Pentagon papers. Oil in Syria it's bigger than trump. Russia wants there pipeline why do you think they are in Syria.
1611 2018-04-12 21:05:13 I gotta go get Chanel an oil change.
1612 2018-04-12 21:05:13 Or let's put your total ignorance on SYRIAN FP to the side for one moment and assume as you can type you can read. So you can type SHALE FOUND SYRIA. Also GOLAN HEIGHTS OIL.  (Now when you decide to take your foot out your mouth you MIGHT have a more informed view of what's up)
1613 2018-04-12 21:05:08 theres that song oil can harry played on his air violin
1614 2018-04-12 21:05:06 Bahati saying that when the oil eventually comes out, Uganda will be prosperous. Y'all are greedy, you will feast on all that Oil money and leave the country in tatters.

1615 2018-04-12 21:05:04 @theresa_may get bombing Syria. That oil pipeline isn't going to build itself. Oh, and of course think of the children!
1616 2018-04-12 21:04:56 Right, all that Oil we stole after going in to Iraq and ridding that Country and the World  of Saddam Hussein. Your point would have more validity if we actually took the Oil.

Willing to look at increasing. Perhaps vaping is not the best way to take it?

Donny boy, when your children are trying to drink oil, eat coal, breath carbon dioxide, while drowning in polluted water maybe then you will believe in change.
1625 2018-04-12 21:03:09 Look at the chaos in Libya. And they want to replicate that in Syria. I don't care how much oil Syria has - it isn't worth one innocent life.

1630 2018-04-12 21:03:03 Add some SPF sis, baby oil in the sun is no beuno.
1631 2018-04-12 21:02:42 MSM soft pedals the consultation process how it didn't happen and doesn't inform readers on its realities. I've only read that treaty right all say 'no' yet oil says 'yes' and here's the date so this country isn't at all how it presents itself.
1632 2018-04-12 21:02:38 Agreed. The ones that are leaking are already built. No one can argue that they were built with a focus on safety. The intent is to build them better and safer with effective monitoring. Transportation of oil by rail is not satisfactory either.

1634 2018-04-12 21:02:26 Just don't attack Syria why would assad want war funny you announce we are leaving then boom gas attack we don't believe it sir. Maybe has something to do with pipeline to Russia or maybe there vast oil untapped in Syria. We don't want war.
1635 2018-04-12 21:02:21 If the people are the greatest treasure of America then back off on Syria for our safety and prevent war. Assad wouldnt gas his own people when isis is nearly defeated and have the world turn aginst him. It's all for oil. It's war mongering with no evidence, reminds me of obama.
1636 2018-04-12 21:02:12 Hey Zack, do you even know how country roads are getting destroyed by oil and gas big rigs tearing up the roads? County doesn’t have the money to fix because orgs like you don’t care and fight against any taxation of big industry. But damn, new rig gets set up every other month.
1637 2018-04-12 21:02:11 You think in 5 years if the Oil are a bubble playoff team, missing more than making, never making a real deep run, he doesn’t ask out? I’d bet he gives it 2 more seasons without drastic improvement.
1638 2018-04-12 21:02:07 We're in Syria for a pipeline ... we're  in the MidEast for OIL. Oil. Period.
1639 2018-04-12 21:02:04 Come join the oil bull party! Hope you are well Rosie. Hi from Mike Rothman
1640 2018-04-12 21:02:02 Kale you need to just get chopped kale, melt down some coconut oil, mix that up with salt and pepper, lay it out even and flat  on a cookie sheet, 350
For 15 minutes tops
1641 2018-04-12 21:01:55 I wouldn't trust a word out of Macron's mouth. He offers no specific evidence, just "Trust me, I'm President Macron, I'm not selling you snake oil, honest I'm not!"
1642 2018-04-12 21:01:55 waterproof!! and just invest in some coconut oil to remove it easily!!
1643 2018-04-12 21:01:51 If you’re doing your makeup and use highlight, dab some coconut oil with it and it will have u glowin
1644 2018-04-12 21:01:38 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1645 2018-04-12 21:01:32 Go get another oil change
1646 2018-04-12 21:01:20 Remind me again why we care about building this oil pipeline, because I can't see any positives

1650 2018-04-12 21:01:13 2.75 a gallon now for gas!!! I said after GOP TAX SCAM Big Oil would start reaping TRUMPS Invest2016
1651 2018-04-12 21:01:05 Tom they need our pity not our piety. My seat of learning was Edinburgh.  FRR they only oil they found was an oil leak in a van

1653 2018-04-12 21:00:37 I fuck with coconut oil bc it helps my dry skin
1654 2018-04-12 21:00:37 Did you drink your oil properly this morning, bot?
1655 2018-04-12 21:00:29 My car is the only one at the oil change shop. Tell me why there is not a single empty seat in the waiting room.
1656 2018-04-12 21:00:28 I want to order the Latte Palette with my Ulta coupon online but the Cleansing Oil I want is online only too but it’s not in stock 
1657 2018-04-12 21:00:27 Y’all really spending $60 on the Body Lava when you could scrape up a lil bit of highlighter and mix it with some baby oil?
1658 2018-04-12 21:00:26 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this April? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1659 2018-04-12 21:00:23 I see Piers was even more desperate for attention than she was. 
1660 2018-04-12 21:00:18 In fact at the time we highlighted evidence that the US dollar was losing share in the oil trade and that was the reason it was being driven higher - The reduced flow of dollars was driving a dollar short squeeze
1661 2018-04-12 21:00:12 Oil n.: To inclose in a vacuum.
1662 2018-04-12 21:00:09 Over the last decade, Pennsylvania’s universities and trade schools have been incredibly proactive in developing programs to ensure the Marcellus has a top-notch local workforce. Lackawanna College (LC) in Northeastern Pa. – where Cabot Oil and Gas just fulfilled a $2.5 mill
1663 2018-04-12 21:00:09 The biggest problem we have today is that we've been brainwashed into thinking those lands far away in the Middle East are full of savages and fundamentalists that want to kill us.
So far all we've (The West) have done is butcher them in their millions. 
For oil.
Think about it.
1664 2018-04-12 21:00:05 Just in! Worth it though- oil aga in pieces at the start of the day post move, end of the day a fully controllable more economical electric Aga fully installed & ready to go
1665 2018-04-12 21:00:03 It has been a very productive day here in the Oil Center. 100 Thank You cards signed, sealed, and out for delivery! #oilcenter @HancockWhitney
1666 2018-04-12 20:59:43 Add oil to your dipbrow!! It works
1667 2018-04-12 20:59:37 Several years ago, Sainsbury announced that they would remove palm oil from their own-brand products. It never happened - and everyone forgot about it. False announcements seem to be a marketing strategy.
1668 2018-04-12 20:59:34 Oil change & Victoria secret’s after work sounds like a plot lol
1669 2018-04-12 20:59:32 Castor Oil mixed with Tea Tree is so good for you hair! Even if it's already healthy, it helps with growth and softness EVEN more - can't lose!
1670 2018-04-12 20:59:29 Unless we take there oil.
1671 2018-04-12 20:59:11 Of course, the oil fields!
1672 2018-04-12 20:59:00 Note to oneself don’t go shopping when tired and no glasses in Sainsbury’s.....just because the jar may say “coconut” doesn’t automatically mean it is oil..... wondered why my black coffee tasted different 
1673 2018-04-12 20:58:41 They’re the worst. Something that Rachel turned me on to recently is peppermint oil. A little dab of that on your finger, wipe it across your forehead, and it’s almost immediate relief.
1674 2018-04-12 20:58:33 Chill chicken to room temp (30min) 
Hot skillet, coat pan with oil
Lay even size/thickness breasts apart from one another, cook for 4 min on one side.
Flip, then put the pan in the oven @ 400 for 8-12 min (chicken should be 160 degrees)
1675 2018-04-12 20:58:30 Hey Al UR a litle dense along with Chuck Shumer. Most humans will die when the OIL runs out so why worry about how warm it is going to get. U should have complaned about the ICE age.
1676 2018-04-12 20:58:14 Pil Pil Prawns  Gambas

Paprika / Olive Oil / Lemon / Garlic — cooking
1677 2018-04-12 20:58:12 I guarantee that pipeline will be built after Sunday. British Columbians will be getting sick from oil leaks into our soil.
1678 2018-04-12 20:58:07 The question to ask is where will that new oil producing capacity come from, it will almost all be unconventional, would it be best to situate some of it in the only jurisdiction with a carbon price/regs/cap in AB?
1679 2018-04-12 20:58:00 The toppings are pretty standard marinara, standard mozzarella, and pepperoni. The trick is to add garlic powder, oregano, and crushed red pepper to the dough before it rises. I substituted butter instead of olive oil in the recipe. That gives it that garlic bread taste.
1680 2018-04-12 20:57:56 Coconut oil got my skin glistening in this good weather
1681 2018-04-12 20:57:52 @PepsiCo Rainforests continue to fall and workers continue to be exploited for the palm oil in PepsiCo's products and in the operations of your notorious business partner Indofood. take action to eliminate suppliers who are violating human rights and destroying rainforests.
1682 2018-04-12 20:57:50 Came to get my oil changed and forgot my tags were out of date. Damn. 
1683 2018-04-12 20:57:43 It’s black charcoal and mineral oil bath bomb
1684 2018-04-12 20:57:42 There are other options. BC has other industries. So does AB. Diversify, invest in our future & @JustinTrudeau & @RachelNotley need to stop acting like we have only one option & should subsidize a giant US oil company for a meager pittance.
1685 2018-04-12 20:57:42 Haven't learn from all these wars?Bombing will not solve anything.

It will however

- Kill or hurt innocents
- Increase refugees
- Increase radicals / terrorists
- Destroy a country

All this for what? To take oil & gas? To centralise their banks?

#NotInMyNameTheresaMay
1686 2018-04-12 20:57:25 Bish @cjsbishop lost at social media so badly yesterday, that after dozens of oil and gas, & health tweets he had to opt for a burger emoji. A burger emoji.
1687 2018-04-12 20:57:19 Give them back their land, oil and all.
1688 2018-04-12 20:57:15 Not only were they promoting the ACV but next to it was 'benefits of coconut oil's and 'benefits of sea salt'. I had to walk away I was so angry
1689 2018-04-12 20:57:15 No way, once US finds out about this you're not gonna get the time to open your oil company
1690 2018-04-12 20:57:03 That was washday. Now everyday in a spray bottle have some water, a spoon of leave on conditioner and a couple of spoons of castor oil. Spray it every morning to keep it moisturized and at night spray it again and do thick twists before you sleep so it doesn’t tangle
1691 2018-04-12 20:56:55 If Canada is only represented by Ontario and oil companies, I wouldn't blame BC from leaving Canada
1692 2018-04-12 20:56:54 And even after the peak, oil demand declines by 1 mbpd, still necessitating at least another 1.5 mbpd of new investment. US tight cannot make up the gap, "only" about 18 mbpd of new capacity.
1693 2018-04-12 20:56:38 Hate the dickheads who quench in water!!! Always oil you tits!!!
1694 2018-04-12 20:56:34 oil paints r really hard lolz:(
1695 2018-04-12 20:56:33 They don't. Oil companies knew about this in the late 20th century.
1696 2018-04-12 20:56:27 Energy and oil service stocks are the place to be this summer
1697 2018-04-12 20:56:26 Right now I'm loving artichokes, red onions, olives and pancetta on an oil and herb base!! Your pizza looks beautiful. Maybe I'll just come right over! :)
1698 2018-04-12 20:56:18 Do you have a website? Interested in the coconut oil mixture you mentioned. Family member with fibromyalgia.
1699 2018-04-12 20:55:48 #ConfidenceinCanada
We are Canadians. We're a strong people that prides ourselves on doing what's right not what's easy. Let's all take a bold step to tomorrow and stop relying on oil. 
Make Canada green!
#greencanada
1700 2018-04-12 20:55:33 Then you use the Loc Method. 

Leave in conditioner : try Purpal Hair, afrobotanics 
Oil =Shea butter 
Cream =my natural / afrobotanics.
1701 2018-04-12 20:55:19 No but I believe trump and Putin would cook it up. Oil prices rise Putin’s Happy war will help trump deflect from corruption and makes him look like he’s against Putin
1702 2018-04-12 20:55:17 Oil changing ppl always trying tell me some mo shit wrong w the car just change the oil and let me get tf on
1703 2018-04-12 20:55:14 I hope they do it. Long over due. So cocky they claim they do not need oil and gas well good for them. Let us know how this works for ya!
1704 2018-04-12 20:55:13 OIL交換しないとだな
1705 2018-04-12 20:55:06 A group of women has set off on a walk across part of the Great Australian Bight in protest against plans to drill for oil and gas.

The eight women - headed by one dressed as a seagull - plan to walk from Penong, on South Australia's west coast, to the Head of the Bight.

1707 2018-04-12 20:54:51 whenever i wonder abt my lower back spasms i really just have to remember that semester i carried all of my oil paint in a duffle bag bc i didn’t have a painting space yet
1708 2018-04-12 20:54:42 If I found out I was the spawn of Cap’n Cheeto Dust, I’d legit throw my face into burning oil and present my bare ass to a very horny Kodiak bear...
1709 2018-04-12 20:54:38 Havarti, pan fried bread in avocado oil and a sandwich press
1710 2018-04-12 20:54:37 We "can't afford to explore and implement green energy options" across the globe but we CAN afford to spend 200 million dollars on 1 oil rig.
1711 2018-04-12 20:54:32 yeah sometimes i mix olive oil w the vinegar....although tomatoes sound so good mmmmm
1712 2018-04-12 20:54:27 This is too simple a description, to maintain current production oil production needs to expand by 2.5 mbpd to offset decline in conventional reserves. Even in IEA sustainable dev scenario oil demand remains unchanged to 2028. Meaning an extra 25 mbpd needs to come online
1713 2018-04-12 20:54:23 After saying how bad oil and gas is, she hops on a plane?
1714 2018-04-12 20:54:20 No Country for Old Men and Blood for Oil
1715 2018-04-12 20:54:20 We will be closed next Thursday, Friday and Saturday!  We are headed to D.C.'s Cannabis Festival to see what we can learn and next summer with the new Vermont laws we will be making our own CBD oil!!!!
1716 2018-04-12 20:54:18 A careful mix of avoiding things that make you feel horrendous whilst gradually exposing yourself to them so you don’t prolong intolerance.  Get this wrong every day! Earplugs. Perseverance & the love of others. Avoid painkillers. Lavender oil!! (2)
1717 2018-04-12 20:54:16 So why do all the scientists who work for oil companies deny AGW?
1718 2018-04-12 20:53:44 Lucas Oil Speedway has canceled their event this weekend. If you were a winner. I will keep your names for the next Suite event.

1724 2018-04-12 20:53:21 Sitting in ochem massaging my scalp and thinking about how much coconut oil im going to slob on my scalp to make these bangs fucking grow
1725 2018-04-12 20:53:13 That's unbelievable he knows exactly what he heard. Did anyone ask him about his investment in the oil in Kansas? I bet not and he would deny it
1726 2018-04-12 20:53:07 How much more valuable are Brazilian beans considered than US.  Based on higher protein and Oil??
1727 2018-04-12 20:52:57 And also balsamic/soy/toasted sesame seed oil
1728 2018-04-12 20:52:44 My go to simple one is white wine vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, olive oil, sea salt / pepper ...
1729 2018-04-12 20:52:39 Okay, first prepoo your hair using an oil of your choice (coconut, olive, castor) heat it up and kept it on overnight before washing or for an hour or so. Helps makes your hair soft
1730 2018-04-12 20:52:33 As if baby oil as an illuminator is news . Ahk.
1731 2018-04-12 20:52:12 A lime and passion fruit dressing with a decent oil and lots of fresh grated garlic.
1732 2018-04-12 20:52:08 お疲れ様！
これからは遊びたい放題(‘＊‘)
1733 2018-04-12 20:51:57 Cut off there oil and gas supplies
1734 2018-04-12 20:51:51 We can't have Syria winning, how will Israel get their land and oil then?
1735 2018-04-12 20:51:43 Didn’t they strike oil on their land?
1736 2018-04-12 20:51:37 Great idea! Not doing baby oil (petroleum) but my favorite dry oil....
1737 2018-04-12 20:51:33 Sesame oil, fresh orange juice  and  a wee bit of soy for seasoning.
1738 2018-04-12 20:51:26 America: this is your chance ONCE MORE, to prove that a TV snake oil huckster has no right to manipulate your mind!
1739 2018-04-12 20:51:19 Yeah, mayo puts a nicer crispier crust when grilled than butter. Not Miracle Whip, real mayo...oil and egg. Give it a try.
1740 2018-04-12 20:51:17 It may well be in the national interest for Alberta to take their billions and kick start a renewable energy infrastructure manufacturing sector rather than investing in KInder Morgan. They can use local oil to do it and BC would happily ship their products to the world. 
#WhyNot
1741 2018-04-12 20:51:14 Oh. About that business owned by the Chinese government? It's one of the largest oil and gas companies in the    

Musta slipped his mind.
1742 2018-04-12 20:51:14 oil
1743 2018-04-12 20:51:09 You're not shipping steel either. You are shipping the bitumen equivalent. Also, Canada is not a bubble. What pollutes one part of the world affects the whole world. I'm from Venezuela and I would rather promote canadian oil with canadian safety standars than buy venezuelan oil.
1744 2018-04-12 20:51:02 Those same corps. receive subsidies from the US government so if you support taking subsidies away from oil companies than we can agree. The process of making them obsolete, which I agree with, requires admitting humans contribute to climate change. Even Exxon knows this.
1745 2018-04-12 20:51:00 @CNBCClosingBell Amazon forget about Texas they have oil and lots of money which they don't want to spend on their citizens
1746 2018-04-12 20:50:55 Pls why are democrats buying Russian oil while obstructing drilling ? Clinton .  Kerry and Biden selling military technology to China . Clinton sold uranium and technology for skolkovo . Wonder why we were hacked .
1747 2018-04-12 20:50:41 Oil & Gas Exploration Permits Halted After 2400 Animals Died During Last Month’s Tragic Oil Spill In Colombia!
1748 2018-04-12 20:50:34 I had a coupon for a Free Blaze pizza in my car. I get my oil changed and these hoes stole it Smfh 
1749 2018-04-12 20:50:27 Mr 45 can go after the banks. So the pedos and dodgy oil cartels best take heed. He's been given a bum steer on Syria as the pipeline is already being built in Azerbaijan. And elsewhere.  So others know - so should NSA and CIA. And if not WHY NOT, Mr President? @KremlinRussia_E

1753 2018-04-12 20:50:15 Mix salad dressed with olive oil, pink tomatoes, tuna fish roasted(like "blue" condition) in provance spices, egg poached and unagi sauce.
1754 2018-04-12 20:50:14 US seems to have learned nothing from past. Afghanistan( russia invaded,CIA trained Jihadis, result Osama and Taliban), Removed anti-Jihadi Saddam, supported Wahabi groups in secular Syria - result IS and civil war. All to support Oil lobby and make Iran weak at Israel’s prodding
1755 2018-04-12 20:50:09 It's a mess that will never be solved. We drew straight lines in the sand in 1919 and that is the root cause. If it wasn't for the oil nobody would give a flying fuck.
1756 2018-04-12 20:50:09 UM not to be masc for masc but changing your own oil is really easy and super super cheap
1757 2018-04-12 20:50:01 Well! Today could end up being a Very Good Day. Didn't hurt as much as usual when I got up this morning \o/; have my first appt with Kiwi the Phrenological Sorceress soon; and my first batch of CBD oil just got delivered. Stiff fingers crossed!
1758 2018-04-12 20:49:56 Its such a shameful and inhuman act. Their genitals should be burnt with that diya tied up at the same place, salt should be rubbed and again pour oil. They should feel the pain what the small child had undergone. They do not have any rights to live in this society. RIP Humanity
1759 2018-04-12 20:49:52 That's the thing thou assad is not to blame . He never attacked his own people it's a made up story by the zionist controlled west so the west can invade and steal all the gold and oil . False flag attack . Just like the Russian spy false flag attack
1760 2018-04-12 20:49:49 Burning the late night oil and then I realize it's only 9:45pm and I'm old
1761 2018-04-12 20:49:39 Trump Furious ? - lets check that score card.
Was he furious about the school shootings - No
Was he furious about oil companies spilling oil on US soil - No.

1774 2018-04-12 20:47:20 Restoration is a permanent process. Any time you visit something is under repair. The upkeep was ignored or below par in previous years. Now things have changed but lot of it is beyond repair. The oil refinery damaged it's look/color now they keep on embalming it in multani.

1777 2018-04-12 20:47:01 i think you're right. Thought to make this 7.5 to 22 billion dollar annual industry yr Greenpeace/PW Coopers research says 100 billion worth of investment is needed first. PS I voted green and i donate to greenpeace but I also know who sits on the money and its invested in oil.

1784 2018-04-12 20:46:33 Ending oil and gas exploration in NZ will do zero for reducing fossil fuel usage. You should be focusing on the demand side where real gains can be made.
1785 2018-04-12 20:46:10 That never has happened to me. I also use Aldi brand coconut oil! I just use normal shampoo and conditioner afterwards. Feels so soft afterwards!
1786 2018-04-12 20:46:09 Why my lil $3 oil roll on from the hair store smell better & last longer than my Gucci Perfume.
1787 2018-04-12 20:46:08 Most of our Salmon stocks are depressed now..so you've done a great job 'standing up for them' so far....Sounds like just using them as yet another excuse to try to kill an oil project. The existing tankers/pipeline didnt kill the salmon off.
1788 2018-04-12 20:46:05 And we didn't take the oil.
1789 2018-04-12 20:46:00 @AndrewScheer Hi Andrew...Trudeau cant even built  a water pipeline for the yearly growth of hemp providing jobs in all sectors so really how do you expect him to build oil pipelines, He cant remember which master to worship so lets get rid of him...All aboard to hell

1795 2018-04-12 20:45:15 here’s the life of being black at a PWI . . . grabbing olive oil from the pantry at work and putting it on your arms because your white coworkers don’t have lotion .

1801 2018-04-12 20:44:36 It's truly amazing to see those who fight for oil production jobs are the good guys, and those who fight for environmental safety are the bad guys...

What kind of fucking nonsense world do we live in?
1802 2018-04-12 20:44:30 For me bombing Syria would be like pouring oil on a fire to put it out. Name me one successful intervention by the West in the Middle East? Ever? Suez? Iraq 2003? Libya?
1803 2018-04-12 20:44:28 Again, holding out to use coal and oil rather than an energy source that protects the earth .
1804 2018-04-12 20:44:24 Okay yes I did this for a time (or like used castor oil on my roots) but washing it out is horrible?? I end up having to use shampoo on my ends to get it out which seems to end up making it worse?
1805 2018-04-12 20:44:22 Obama sent not one Wall St. Banker to jail, Climate denile is for the oil under the ice, & The legal corruption in DC keeps all this rolling along. It's gotten to deep to cherry pick issues.. No issue can be resolved or even debated when the voice of the people are ignored...
1806 2018-04-12 20:44:21 “Safety” is not the issue.  Protecting the planet from release of carbon that needs to remain sequestered deep below ground is.  Expanding oil exploitation at a time we should be reducing it is wrong.
1807 2018-04-12 20:44:11 I think that is not as relevant as the 'mother of all' oil finds in the Golan Heights
1808 2018-04-12 20:44:04 Tried it, glad it worked for the baby, but sadly didn’t for my daughter.  100% coconut oil for her psoriasis and Eumovate for her Eczema at the moment.

1811 2018-04-12 20:43:55 Ah, I see. Go for the oil painting if you want to keep it consistent. (But again, I’d look good in any of them.)

Forgive this little Pākehā, but I didn't think stuff you burn to peril the planet and tāngata is usually called a taonga like that.

Why is radio nz reading out the comments section and ruining my morning.
1817 2018-04-12 20:43:11 I could be wrong but doesnt John Pagani work in the oil industry? Of course that doesn't mean he is incorrect, just he may have a vested interest in opposing the govt. Threats to income trumps politics.

1820 2018-04-12 20:42:42 I'm not convinced of it yet either...but the 'peak oil' projections were seemingly wrong, so I'm gun shy on cobalt (especially as the early lithium price pop projections have now turned to a short term glut).

1826 2018-04-12 20:41:54 Well isn’t all “green” energy being subsidized?  Not against it but let’s be real. Oil is still the big dog and we are damm lucky for shale technology or we would be screwed

1828 2018-04-12 20:41:45 Absolutely @ruhithallon, I think we need to reduce our consumption of oil of any type. As we don't want to replace palm oil with the next 'super' oil that will just destroy another environment somewhere else. Humans really are a disaster on this planet x

1830 2018-04-12 20:41:40 Would love to see oil go limit down. Cannot believe the BS I am hearing as to why oil is headed to 70 easy and then 80 due to the Mid East "tensions". The mid East has always been in tension!!

1835 2018-04-12 20:41:17 This is actually just a very lightly frosted one. Saw someone use baby oil. I use sunflower. If gets stinky just wash off & do again. For the necklace that was a present I added essential oils so smelt gorgeous!
1836 2018-04-12 20:41:14 And apparently we are phasing out oil. They are trying to use it up faster.
1837 2018-04-12 20:41:11 Torymouthpiece BBC have staged dead cat strategy of Enoch Powell Rivers of Blood broadcast. Means Syria hit already planned for this Fri/Sat. So focus on ancient speech frm dead politico instead of fury at UK being thrown into proxy war for oil/land & pipeline.
Who gets the oil?
1838 2018-04-12 20:41:04 Thanks ! Oil Traders are pushing Crisis in Syria to push Oil+Gas Prices up w/ Instability.

1849 2018-04-12 20:40:06 Are you aware that there are 895000 barrels of oil being shipped up and down the BC Coast right now.  And are you aware that 86% of that volume is American?   I think that the ship has sailed... Literally.

1858 2018-04-12 20:38:18 Ever notice in Canada it is only constitutional crisis when massive American corporation can't build their oil pipeline. But when folks can't get drinking water, or white guys get off with murder, or #mmiw, or people can't afford housing it's an inconvenience at best.

1870 2018-04-12 20:37:21 It is far more likely that Turkey is behind the IS / Daesh oil issue. They allowed the oil into the West via Turkish pipelines. It’s all Erdogan.

1878 2018-04-12 20:36:33 Exactly! I was thinking to mix highlighting powder and fix plus together. It’s just the baby oil in the middle of summer 
1879 2018-04-12 20:36:29 FWIW, I swear by tabbouleh in the summer, and I usually make it with quinoa. Basic version: boil + chill quinoa,  mix it to taste with olive oil, salt, lemon juice, also chopped cucumbers and tomatoes.

1883 2018-04-12 20:36:15 agreed. the key takeaway for joe the plumber is this though:

"Global oil demand must fall from today's 95 million barrels a day to about 65 million by 2050. As a high-cost, high-emission resource, oil sands will not expand as oil prices fall in a declining oil market.

1894 2018-04-12 20:35:25 I was listening to that in the bath.

1898 2018-04-12 20:35:06 No doubt. Problem is, and if you believe the scientific community, continuing down this path of increasing GHG emissions will mean the end of civilization.

1899 2018-04-12 20:35:02 LRT WHEN MY MOM WAS A WAITRESS SHE WOULD KEEP A BOTTLE OF BABY OIL IN HER APRON TO PUT ON HER LEGS TO MAKE THEM SHINY AND IT’S A BIG MOOD
1900 2018-04-12 20:35:00 Do carwash attendants also change oil?
1901 2018-04-12 20:34:55 "i'll consider shoving olive oil up my ass" LMAO HELP 
1902 2018-04-12 20:34:53 The best way forward is for you, clinging to power with support of 3 fringe Greens, to call an election. Let it be fought on whether BCers want to pay $120+ to fill up their cars - the likely result of Alberta turning off the oil spigot.
1903 2018-04-12 20:34:52 No offense. I follow .@LisaMei62 Q Decode for a few months now. We learn awhile back that Snowden took Q's offer when ES was allegedly in China. Team Q spotted ES burning midnight oil in his safe house. Then ES tweeted cryptic YES reply. Q welcomed ES.
1904 2018-04-12 20:34:52 It s nothing whatsoever to do with oil...........
1905 2018-04-12 20:34:42 I sometimes feel we have a snake oil salesman for a PM.
1906 2018-04-12 20:34:41 Unlike our liberal bourgeoisie, many of us support Israel's right to survive.  US involvement in the Mideast is exclusively about securing US oil interests in that region. Want peace in the Mideast? Get US oils companies out of the region.
1907 2018-04-12 20:34:40 It’s never just an oil change....
1908 2018-04-12 20:34:39 £750 Billion a year they collect in working folks taxes. the mp's are feasting on that big cash. then they give £6 Billion a year in tax subsidies to millionaires in the oil and gas industry, but punish the poor, disabled oap's, and ex army vets and the homeless. people are blind
1909 2018-04-12 20:34:28 Roast it. Grill it. Turn it into a pesto! We go way beyond being coated in olive oil ;)
1910 2018-04-12 20:33:57 The key to this statement is “the exports compensate in part”. It’s only the royalty component of oil exports which compensate, and this is deliberately fudged by the proponents of fossil fuel extraction.
1911 2018-04-12 20:33:57 yeah i missed the tactility of oil paint and its light fastness. I've lost some true-ness to my poster color pieces in the past, and spray mediums dull the colors though it does make them archival>?
1912 2018-04-12 20:33:39 She obviously needs an oil reducing pad. I didn't know 70+ year olds could have such oily skin
1913 2018-04-12 20:33:28 Oil and gas should not be the only area of focus. There are so many upcoming and ongoing projects.
1914 2018-04-12 20:33:04 SPX closed up 0.83%, rejected the 2672. All indices ended up, USD marginal gains vs CAD,EUR, and CHF. Neutral AUD,  negative vs GBP and NZD. Kiwi broadly up vs all majors. Oil settled 25 cents higher, treasuries down.
1915 2018-04-12 20:33:03 Absolutely correct. That's religious intolerance.

Though holy water, anointing oil, beads, charms etc are all bullshit.
1916 2018-04-12 20:33:02 8000 on Fb and twitter now know the truth on SYRIA. @syria_true Shale and oil. As I said before GE15. @POTUS @UN @UNICEF @theresa_may Russia it appears can read. Mind you when I had my own website KREMLIN policy building followed me. @KremlinRussia_E
1917 2018-04-12 20:32:56 Indians and native people of quite many regions of the earth are even today treated as fauna although their ontological category might be different. Oil does wonders.
1918 2018-04-12 20:32:45 Shane Jones on oil & gas on @NZMorningReport: NZ can’t go around signing international agreements ( Paris) while doing nothing at home & wrecking the environment. But that is exactly what’s happening in the marine space. NZ signed up to UN 10% protection target but sits at 0.5%
1919 2018-04-12 20:32:41 I fully support Iceland’s stance on palm oil AND plastic. Yes- pressure on all suppliers and producers.
1920 2018-04-12 20:32:37 Steel drives the economy of the world but oil and gas doesn't. Interesting argument.
1921 2018-04-12 20:32:33 Solar energy is any day better than polluting oil.   Entire world is moving towards renuables. Don't defend oil just because your party is investing in it. Mr. Modi himself has brought on a Solar revolution in the country. Or was he wrong in doing that ?
1922 2018-04-12 20:32:33 this is the lesson they have learned from Iraq= oil galore and money all round for the victors
1923 2018-04-12 20:32:31 I JUST TURNED MY CAR IN TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AND LEFT AT LEAST 2 OZ UNDER THE FRONT SEAT, DABS IN THE PASSENGER, AND MY BONG IN THE BACKSEAT 
how did I not realize 
will I be allowed to come back here???

1929 2018-04-12 20:32:11 Maybe Notley could show some real backbone and introduce exclusion zones around Kinder Morgan offices to protect employees and associates from anti oil nut jobs...
1930 2018-04-12 20:32:07 Oil is up 300% from Jan 2016 lows. OSX only up 30% since 
1931 2018-04-12 20:31:52 @EUCouncil @EU_Commission @Europarl_EN IMO ITER must focus also on Electricity Generation w/ compact fusion reactors ASAP , not just Fusion Theory. EU must be Energy Independent: See how fake Syria Crisis & potential War is pushing Oil UP for Traders/Shorters/Speculators,a scam.

TPP designed to compete & defeat China on trade: Trump withdrew

Mortgage rates up
Deficits projected to cripple America sooner than previously expected
1934 2018-04-12 20:31:39 God I fucking hate dealerships maybe I do need to learn to change my own oil now out of how spiteful I am
1935 2018-04-12 20:31:33 This tweet literally makes zero sense, there's oil in Somalia which why the United States is involved. Unfollow me.
1936 2018-04-12 20:31:26 Mayo is just oil and eggs anyway, no?
1937 2018-04-12 20:31:21 Burned some incense, wearing my favorite essential oil blend that I’ve made, listening to some dark wave, dabbing and about to head to therapy. 
1938 2018-04-12 20:31:19 Every single semi-truck carrying goods from BC ports to Canada shouldbe inspected for safety and emissions and oil leaks. No exceptions.If this inspection will save one drop of oil leaking from a leaky engine, then it will be worth it. It's the environment, you know. @ezralevant
1939 2018-04-12 20:31:16 must get the pipeline built now,BC does not run or own Canada,we can't continue to be held hostage by USA oil prices!!!
1940 2018-04-12 20:31:07 The opposition reaction to the oil announcement shows why the Blue Green thing was  unlikely
1941 2018-04-12 20:31:07 There is no fix to the JCPOA:it legitimizes illicit uranium enrichment infrastructure instead of dismantling it&provides regional proliferation incentive.@realDonaldTrump should withdraw without delay&reimpose oil and CBI sanctions until dismantlement completed.#IranProtests
1942 2018-04-12 20:31:05 Mr D surprised me with two nights @GrangeHotels St Paul’s as thanks for my gifts to him of Saturday night @Indian_Accent then @bookofmormonldn which I love but he’s not seen.

1943 2018-04-12 20:31:04 Wow very sexy, can i oil u up more?
1944 2018-04-12 20:31:00 We produce oil, which we export. We also import oil. The exports compensate in part for the imports. The Govt will have us import all our oil, so we will be in debt.
1945 2018-04-12 20:30:38 I have been using coconut oil lately
1946 2018-04-12 20:30:35 This is true. But now I’ve gotta dust off the old mono use appliance waffle maker when I could just use a frying pan and some olive oil. Cleanup after pancakes is slightly easier so you gotta give them the edge there
1947 2018-04-12 20:30:34 I enjoy reading about what the market was up (tension easy in Syria and earnings) and oil increase (increase tension in Syria).
1948 2018-04-12 20:30:30 *boom!*
1949 2018-04-12 20:30:21 and although i def didnt use my 3 x 3 for any job hunting IM hella pursuing large oil paintings now which i have john to thank for. But that makes me like 1 of a class of 30 that it was good for? maybe?
1950 2018-04-12 20:30:15 USA  is a net oil exporter 
1951 2018-04-12 20:30:12 Mayo is just egg, oil & mustard.  Nothing to hate there. Cooks really well on the outside of grilled cheese. You get a nice golden brown on the outside

1954 2018-04-12 20:29:58 Oil bunkering, badoo, discovery of shrines and now illegal brewery factory in Ikorodu should be a worry for an average resident. We can't but strengthen community policing in our localities to reduce crime
1955 2018-04-12 20:29:28 Many of us support Israel's right to exist. Jews are indigenous to that bit of land, surrounded by Arab countries. Don't blame Israel for US actions in protecting US oil corporations in the Arab states.
1956 2018-04-12 20:29:26 Find a way to drive fuel cost down and cut some of the tax on diesel fuel and regular fuel. Using our own resources instead of buying from other countries would help lower the cost of oil and gas.
1957 2018-04-12 20:29:24 Agreed AFC record in Europe is poor we’ve won 4 them 1 Man City & CFC bought there’s with oil money so to me they don’t count - Mufc built there legacy with Fergie and like we are doing building is class then when you win CL, or titles you can say it’s a great team!

1970 2018-04-12 20:27:31 The BC Tourism industry employs thousands of men and women and thousands more, including many indigenous communities make their living from the sea. There is absolutely no evidence that shipping oil by oil tanker to Asia is going to create any employment, outside the oil patch.

1976 2018-04-12 20:26:57 TBH I drive a vehicle and until I can realistically justify a electric vehicle I will need fuel from oil so in principle there needs to be oil. However this is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty & should be protected from this type of activity.

2023 2018-04-12 20:20:58 Russia’s economy is in bad shape. She depends on exports of oil and gas and while she could charge $12 a unit in 2012 for gas she now gets $5.Her oil is running down while the US exports more and more shale oil.Sanctions today bite hard.Her GDP is now about the size of Holland’s.

2025 2018-04-12 20:20:44 I will be on @MoneyTalks on the Corus Network this Saturday with Michael Campbell to discuss the very topical issue of the politics of oil infrastructure and the Kinder Morgan pipeline. (1 of 2)
2026 2018-04-12 20:20:44 @OLDDAZECLOTHING bout to have me go out sad talm bout some smoke cbd oil while I’m in papers
2027 2018-04-12 20:20:39 nah opec is loosing to shale, opec will slash prices again if it can. As long as oil and gas companies don't manipulate the price then it should in fact go down. It is actually OPEC and energy company hyjinks that make gas exspenive at all.
2028 2018-04-12 20:20:37 @PepsiCo must close its policy loophole for JV partners & require all palm oil produced and purchased by @Indofood & Salim Group to meet PepsiCo's policy. Relying on RSPO can't ensure #palmoil free of deforestation, peat destruction and exploitation.

Shut down the oil and gas industry, tick. I wonder how he can champion the regions next week! @stevenljoyce @PaulGoldsmithMP
2039 2018-04-12 20:19:43 Kemfert says that an investment in an oil pipeline that we don’t need is $ to a stranded asset #RECities @PICSCanada #cdnpoli #bcpoli
2040 2018-04-12 20:19:40 Cost effective? At what point did the @EPA begin lobbying for oil and gas? Oh right, you always been that way: A corrupt puppet who knowingly destroys the environment from the Agency that helped STOP FLAMING LAKES. Can’t wait to see what you do next!

2046 2018-04-12 20:19:14 Yet the Democrats have them smiling all the way into the vat of boiling oil (voting booth). Identity politics are an astounding thing.
2047 2018-04-12 20:19:13 @SenatorCantwell I’m outraged that Scott Pruitt is spending my taxpayer dollars on lavish unnecessary expenses while he’s attempting to strangle the EPA’s budget, destroying environmental safeguards, and putting the interests of the oil, gas, and coal industries ahead of the life
2048 2018-04-12 20:19:10 "we haven't gone into great depth on that"

Honestly it takes like an hour and a link to capfriendly to figure it out.
2049 2018-04-12 20:19:06 Perhaps the two gentlemen could check their facts as oil sands are neither the dirtiest nor most polluting crude on the market and the process of getting off fossil fuels will take decades during which we will still require those fossil fuels to allow civilization to continue.
2050 2018-04-12 20:19:03 What about high CBD Vape oil?
2051 2018-04-12 20:19:00 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
2052 2018-04-12 20:19:00 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
2053 2018-04-12 20:18:55 I dont remember anyone calling for removal of Mugabe. No one batting an eyelid for SA farmers being dragged out of farms.Morals selective where oil is concerned. & why is chemical warfare somehow 'not cricket',where missiles are. As if its somehow more moral to kill with a bullet
2054 2018-04-12 20:18:55 Ill give you strawberry but olive oil>anything else to crisp a grilled cheese
2055 2018-04-12 20:18:53 An oil that is not petroleum based like Baby oil is a great start. There are so many amazing oils out there to choose from obviously if you’re allergic, chose another.
2056 2018-04-12 20:18:51 YES - I use topical magnesium oil on my feet at night (need to wear socks) . It can irritate other parts of skin, but on heals & foot work great. Helps with sleep! A weird added positive is that it KNOCKS OUT athletes foot fungus like nothing else available! 
2057 2018-04-12 20:18:50 Yeah, was the oil that done it, right? Not the inept leadership, school boy economics or the massive public over spending!
2058 2018-04-12 20:18:50 Aside from coconut oil, what is another go-to?
2059 2018-04-12 20:18:49 lol i saw a tweet on @sapphicstrology not too long ago about how virgos love the smell of rose and here i am putting on a rose water face mask, putting rose oil in my bath like damn they were right
2060 2018-04-12 20:18:48 Oil industry talking points:
1. We were blindsided by this thing that we’ve known about for a century.
2. Our jobs are the only jobs that will ever exist.
3. If we stop stabbing ourselves someone else will stab us the same amount, so we’d better keep up the stabbing.
2061 2018-04-12 20:18:37 i just saw this vid of someone mixing baby oil and highlight together to basically make the body glow stuff they made lol
2062 2018-04-12 20:18:26 There is now a $10- risk premium in crude oil which should erode if these items are resolved successfully.
2063 2018-04-12 20:18:23 yes i’m passive aggressively taking my frustration out on my roommate today but who still listens to the national — that shit is like whole grain pasta with olive oil in music form
2064 2018-04-12 20:18:20 How about you use our tax dollars to support our public lands & not on #StinkyZinke flying private jets to gun conventions & oil company soirées? How many seasonals, YCCs or SCAs could have been hired for his $139k door?
2065 2018-04-12 20:18:19 I have been taking my evening primrose oil for nearly a week now and I have noticed a big difference in my anxiety that I,am not so much anxious and I feel more relaxed, and I would definitely recommend evening primrose oil if you suffer from anxiety 
2066 2018-04-12 20:18:14 Industry plays one jurisdiction against another for the greatest gain.

I call it the old fashioned  race to the bottom.

Let's see how things work when the oil and gas industry,has to double or triple the price at the pump.

Life w/o the free 5 trillion
2067 2018-04-12 20:18:05 Will the US add more sanctions against Russia and Iran – limiting their sale of crude oil? Will Yemen with Iran’s help, fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia?
2068 2018-04-12 20:17:57 tea tree oil sweaty
2069 2018-04-12 20:17:57 What is the part of the purpose of Site C? Selling electricity to Alberta and the oil sands? If that is the case not much point without the pipeline? Don't they kinda go hand in hand? Please educate me on this.
2070 2018-04-12 20:17:51 Crude oil remains lofty due to political issues in the middle east. When or if the US will bomb Syria and if there will be a response from Russia or Iran?
2071 2018-04-12 20:17:50 Castor oil! You can get it at Sally’s and I use a spooly brush and comb it through my brows and lashes before bed :)
2072 2018-04-12 20:17:46 @Mobil1 what is oil good to use in Saudi Arabia  temperature is 45 C in summer afternoon.
2073 2018-04-12 20:17:34 It is rather fantastic isn't it?
2074 2018-04-12 20:17:28 'Skelewu'..........  If only we can be serious with our entertainment industry, I think that's the next leading export from Nigeria after Oil.

2077 2018-04-12 20:17:17 we just came for an oil change and my mom might dip with a new car
2078 2018-04-12 20:17:14 Oil companies plan it this way. As weather improves gas price goes up. $3.37 in my neck of woods. For cheap stuff
2079 2018-04-12 20:17:05 But before then, this issue of this oil will soon clear us for eye. 

The world is moving towards Renewable energy we are here battling over CO causing agent.
2080 2018-04-12 20:16:56 The same thing I’m finna do with some LaBronze and coconut oil!!! #Tuh
2081 2018-04-12 20:16:55 Exploiting the region's oil supply and controlling the flow of oil to the West..?
2082 2018-04-12 20:16:43 It is all about a secure oil pipeline

2085 2018-04-12 20:16:15 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2086 2018-04-12 20:16:11 actually all of them pray in Arabic so lets continue discussing other information that you have incorrect. Seems to me you need this to be about religion and its not. I mean hey you see anyone going after malaysia or indonesia? no they are going after oil rich arab countries
2087 2018-04-12 20:16:07 @RepDennyHeck I’m outraged that Scott Pruitt is spending my taxpayer dollars on lavish unnecessary expenses while he’s attempting to strangle the EPA’s budget, destroying environmental safeguards, and putting the interests of the oil, gas, and coal industries ahead of the America
2088 2018-04-12 20:16:04 Please cum relax on the beach, and I will
rub your back pain away with sunshine and baby oil
2089 2018-04-12 20:16:03 Anyone know if Syria has massive oil reserves? Just a thought.
2090 2018-04-12 20:15:58 Lmaooooo. I get sha.

But the oil companies are in the list. Just that they aren't ranked very highly, and they're all lumped together. Like someone remembered midway, and decided to just add the ones they knew.
2091 2018-04-12 20:15:57 How Much Allergic Classmate’s Face Swelled Up In Oil In Case He Still Uncertain About Autoerotic Asphyxiation
2092 2018-04-12 20:15:57 And a big thing you left out is that oil prices are determined by a market, not by oil companies. In addition, what's happened to Canada's currency (oil is globally traded in USD) and taxes?
2093 2018-04-12 20:15:54 Isn’t he Gwyneth Paltrow’s physician? I find it hard to trust anyone associated with that snake oil salesperson.
2094 2018-04-12 20:15:54 He may sweep in on Sunday and it will be fixed. Never mind that the Sask and AB plan to slow down oil to BC has actually done it. Kenny and Moe save the day.
2095 2018-04-12 20:15:53 So... if we meddle in the Middle East, & primary reason behind that were for oil... & if it's financed w/ our tax dollars, shouldn't each one of us (instead of the fat cats) get a return on that investment when oil is acquired?  It's not like we have a choice in this matter.
2096 2018-04-12 20:15:52 Peppermint oil.
2097 2018-04-12 20:15:50 Iraq & Libya got destroyed so US companies got the green light to get the oil. Ukraine, West made coup, US again got the goodies, also got Russia pipeline to EU stopped, so US shale got priority. Africa, Sudan, oil.
2098 2018-04-12 20:15:44 i walked into the bathroom and it smells rlly weird but i just realized thats the tea tree oil on my face lol
2099 2018-04-12 20:15:32 Wow how progressive. It's 2018 and it's just being built? I wonder how many of the not so well meaning  enviromentalists opposing oil use a bathroom and shower in Victoria.
2100 2018-04-12 20:15:28 Baby oil and glitter all #summer18 you goin appreciate this chocolate!
2101 2018-04-12 20:15:27 Cage plays an escapee from hell who survives the collapse of the World Trade Center and helps Louisiana recover from the BP oil spill. In the end, he solves the case, but the attention he gains shines light on his corruption. Gary Poulter costars.

2106 2018-04-12 20:15:05 Dual purpose in Afghanstan the on the table it was to fight the reds the under the table opiun/ heroin

2107 2018-04-12 20:14:59 You gotta try our world famous Dumpster Style Oil Poached Onion Sliders. It's swimming in Frangelico Gazpacho and served in a Fritos bag!
2108 2018-04-12 20:14:43 Syrians, backed by Russians, wanted to control an oil field in Syria - wow, so shocking! How could they?
2109 2018-04-12 20:14:36 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is not dumb. I know this based on the Mexico visit while he was Pres Candidate.  Dodgy banks will fall. Oil companies use BANKS. Remind them of that. Seems someone needs to. @BrugesGroup
2110 2018-04-12 20:14:34 What black women skin care folks do y’all follow? Please don’t send me anyone that relies on coconut oil or St. Ives. TYSM
2111 2018-04-12 20:14:33 Arguably the Iranian assistance in the Iraqi oil fields led to #Daesh refocusing on opium production and exiting the oil looting business and no longer requiring a route through #Syria to their buyers in #Turkey
2112 2018-04-12 20:14:31 Had a great Easter break in Spain. Still helping introduce some top talent to Saudi oil&gas opportunities. Still focussing Republic of South Africa for interviews 2-8 May.
2113 2018-04-12 20:14:21 I have 4 rice cakes with peanut butter (the expensive healthy one with no palm oil), 2 bananas, and a carton of vanilla flavored protein milk after the gym and it’s the greatest thing ever
2114 2018-04-12 20:14:19 For me bombing Syria would be like pouring oil on a fire to put it out. Name me one successful intervention by the West in the Middle East? Ever? Suez? Iraq 2003? Libya?
2115 2018-04-12 20:14:18 Witch hazel & tea tree oil works so well for my skin. I break out at least twice a month & I noticed my skin heals so much faster when I apply witch hazel before bed. I also use a q-tip soaked in 100% tea tree oil to apply it on spots that need to be repaired. 10/10 recommend.
2116 2018-04-12 20:14:01 And anyway, the industry was consulted because Jacinda said very clearly “oil is not our future” and that’s pretty thorough consultation.
2117 2018-04-12 20:13:54 castor oil
2118 2018-04-12 20:13:53 Lean in. Get yourself some eucalyptus essential oil and put cucumber slices in your water.
2119 2018-04-12 20:13:49 I popped 4 painkillers and doused my wisdom in clove oil... 2hrs later and the pain has hit me like a Tyson punch to the face 
2120 2018-04-12 20:13:44 I think it's pretty funny Taker has to go wrestle in fuckin Saudi Arabia because some oil prince made it fuckin rain on Vince
2121 2018-04-12 20:13:27 I use (vegetable) glycerine on my skin and hair. Add it to damp skin/hair after almond oil, shea butter, whatever. Believe it's a humectant so draws in moisture.
2122 2018-04-12 20:13:22 Well the fracking was ongoing when Horgan came along recently so ya can't really blame him for that
I would also say you can't even run in AB w'o being an oil cheerleader to some degree
It's a contest of outrage right now
2123 2018-04-12 20:13:14 I didn't acknowledge that. I wrote that the studies aren't conclusive. You clearly don't understand the full spectrum of the oil industry, supply and demand fundamentals and federal transfers, but I didn't call you an idiot over your very apparent lack of knowledge.
2124 2018-04-12 20:12:58 @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
2125 2018-04-12 20:12:57 If healthy, 97 will drag them kicking and screaming next season
2126 2018-04-12 20:12:52 Girl it works! I literally have had this Victoria secret body shimmer for like 2 years and with the mixture of baby oil it’s now 2 weeks old 
2127 2018-04-12 20:12:32 EPS for Murphy Oil Corporation (MUR) Expected At $0....
2128 2018-04-12 20:12:15 I just want y’all to stop being outraged by mayonnaise on things like grilled cheese bc it’s literally oil and egg.....
2129 2018-04-12 20:12:12 Think that's just because more people see you for the charlatan, sake oil salesman you really are.
2130 2018-04-12 20:12:08 You are in white party ,you must do it white way .how did you survive to move from PAC to DA ?water and oil don't mix ,you are a fighter ,whites need robot something they can use.
2131 2018-04-12 20:12:08 Given NZ has over 500 years of oil reserves already discovered this is a very small step
2132 2018-04-12 20:12:07 Syrian lives don't matter to them either but Syrian oil and Syrian airspace those they care about.
2133 2018-04-12 20:11:51 Then my car shit oil everywhere because my sump has gone, last time I drink a litre of water! 
2134 2018-04-12 20:11:40 Oil and gas - fossil fuels for fossils.
2135 2018-04-12 20:11:35 Yeah I use it when I’m out of butter. But on the outside to get it brown, not the inside. It works in a pinch. Once it’s cooked off, it just tastes like u used veg oil or something.
2136 2018-04-12 20:11:23 My son-in-law works in the oil industry as a driller (embarrassing) he earns ridiculous $, but has to fly to Australia every two weeks. Is only at home for 1/2 the year.  They don't save $ cos have to engage babysitters etc & pay for flights which can't be booked in advance
2137 2018-04-12 20:11:22 You aren't in the Navy until you're three decks down cleaning the bilge for "oil"
2138 2018-04-12 20:11:21 That's a good thought from the concerned authorities...that's the Labour to take Nigeria out of unemployment and reduce dependence on oil
2139 2018-04-12 20:11:20 Guarantee you there is a little more than just a card coming Pete's way on those special days ;)
2140 2018-04-12 20:11:10 o_o You're not worried about adding (flammable) essential oil directly to something that's going to be heated up (and exposed to little static sparks) in the drier? You even specifically name lavender, which is a class 3 flammable liquid.
2141 2018-04-12 20:11:08 I have a highlighter that is WAY too pale for me. I'm gonna crush it, mix it with my body oil and some gold mica and shine all summer.
2142 2018-04-12 20:11:08 Unless your Probiotics are Bacillus Coagulans there is a good chance  they never lived past the bottling and shipping if they made it through the  processing. 

Why Krill plus another fish oil? A quality krill oil like Mercola's is sufficient.
2143 2018-04-12 20:11:06 Can’t afford Fenty Beauty Body Lava, get you some almond oil and highlighter, mix it together and BOOM, you shimmering all summer long sis 
2144 2018-04-12 20:11:05 Presumably #oil companies want money not #environmental destruction. Pay them to kill projects now then expropriate wealth after #revolution
2145 2018-04-12 20:10:58 @PepsiCo must close its policy loophole for JV partners & require all palm oil produced and purchased by @Indofood & Salim Group to meet PepsiCo's policy. Relying on RSPO can't ensure #palmoil free of deforestation, peat destruction and exploitation
2146 2018-04-12 20:10:57 No see, there in lies my problem. I think, they will always argue against the psychoactive effects of Marijuana. No matter the massive benefits. That is same arguement they made with cbd oil. Im not saying hemp is not good. But , its not good enuff
2147 2018-04-12 20:10:52 “Can you get my oil out of the thing” and then gets mad when I have no idea what or where the thing is 
2148 2018-04-12 20:10:51 yes dengan oil. leceh sikit tp serius lepas buat muka i tak naik jerawat mcm dulu hehe. tak berminyak pun lah tp nak cari oil yg sesuai dgn kulit tu satu hal jugak
2149 2018-04-12 20:10:50 Not to mention the IMF has estimated Saudi Arabia needs oil at 70$/bbl to make its 2018 budget, giving them an awful lot of moral hazard for colluding and sponsoring disruption.
2150 2018-04-12 20:10:42 the family money came from oil
2151 2018-04-12 20:10:38 We don’t need flags or candles chap... the gap tells you everything... oil doesn’t make a team but you can’t complain... you coffers are pretty healthy as a selling club... Salah next I’d wager
2152 2018-04-12 20:10:37 Thankfully Russia can read and unlike I use the term in its loosest sense Military 'Intelligence' do not require a join the dots. Syria is 4 OIL+SHALE. It will lead to ghosted orphan refugee kids. That will lead to a public(youtube)burning of the global banking system =£5trillion

2155 2018-04-12 20:10:26 Why are gas prices rising? Big oil got their tax cuts. Consumers are now paying more at the pump. Talk about price gauging!!

2159 2018-04-12 20:10:17 If you read the thread you would know the post about marginal investment was in regard to the suggestion of trucking the oil. The environmental protection of Canadian oil production is world leading.
2160 2018-04-12 20:10:10 Everyone ignores Saudi Arabia's offenses because they're rich, oil producing and it is not in their interests to hold them accountable.

2163 2018-04-12 20:10:03 Oil prices rise as news of missiles will be launched.

Now you see why R's & some D's love war so much?

War is one hell of a profitable business (i.e. Cheney made $39.5B off Iraq for Haliburton), hence why there will never be peace on Earth, until all of mankind ceases to exist.

2166 2018-04-12 20:09:55 Oil and water saludos!!!
2167 2018-04-12 20:09:53 Yes, because we totally won't need people to sell electric cars when we're done with oil. 
2168 2018-04-12 20:09:46 You could have just mentioned me, instead of doing thread na . If you check my thread, i said perfume oils are actual perfume elements and extracts in oil fragrances. The replica is the name tagged on each bottle. You're welcome 
2169 2018-04-12 20:09:36 The Oil and Gas NZ CE on morning report just now confirmed they were counting jobs in cafes and small businesses in the region. Ie assumes there is no transition or replacement industry in Taranaki.

2176 2018-04-12 20:08:29 @radionz Any oil exec who says “we didn’t see it coming” is clearly an entirely incompetent oil executive. #nzpol
2177 2018-04-12 20:08:12 All of the things in the metaphor are finite at any given time and for some forward period. Sure, economies bounce back faster than new oil forms... will give you that... I'm so deep I'm a firsthand observer.  
2178 2018-04-12 20:08:12 Also finally made an oil change and emissions test appointment so I can renew my dang plate tags

2181 2018-04-12 20:07:59 Pipelines and rail cars have zero venting therefore no product is lost by either one. Rail uses diesel while pipelines use electricity making pipelines more environmentally friendly. Estimates for the Increase in demand of oil will peak in 2030 making pipelines viable.
2182 2018-04-12 20:07:57 @PepsiCo must close its policy loophole for JV partners & require all palm oil produced and purchased by @Indofood & Salim Group to meet PepsiCo's policy. Relying on RSPO can't ensure #palmoil free of deforestation, peat destruction and exploitation
2183 2018-04-12 20:07:55 But mainly loads of coal money from oil and gas
2184 2018-04-12 20:07:54 One tanker truck carries 200 barrels of oil. The pipeline expansion can move 590,000 barrels of oil per day.  You would need 2,950 trucks a day to equal it out. Do you really think that’s a better idea? 2,950 trucks per day running cross country?
2185 2018-04-12 20:07:45 2018 so far. Europe is being hijrah'ed into the dark ages. America  is ready to tear it's self apart over who's in the presidential office. East and West ready to start WW3 over who controls an oil pipe line through the middle East. Am I missing anything here?
2186 2018-04-12 20:07:41 NZ Oil and Gas really should've hired Michael Laws for that job...
2187 2018-04-12 20:07:41 Had to tell a random girl on snap that she shouldn’t be cooking with coconut oil. I woulda felt like asshole if I didn’t say anything stranger or not
2188 2018-04-12 20:07:38 you’re probably starting to spritz your pillow with lavender essential oil to calm you down and prepare you for bedtime
2189 2018-04-12 20:07:35 And this is the thing that gets me. When the Oilers win the Cup with McDavid, and they will win at least one, many will suggest job well done. Problem being, considering what was here in the summer of 2015, it should deliver much, much more.

2213 2018-04-12 20:05:25 So now we get picture Putin profits with oil price increase so do US petro co ie fake president. Let’s make like a war in Middle East everyone profits. This so 1984 ish Putin trump and Xi carve up the world and have shame disagreements or wars
2214 2018-04-12 20:05:20 If the oil and gas industry in NZ were blindsided and *didn't see this coming*, that is from wilful blindness. All the signs are there internationally that this is a twilight industry and Labour and the Greens flagged their concerns.
2215 2018-04-12 20:05:15 The reality of the common wealth is that Britain and British companies use the relationships to buy goods such as oil and other natural resources at a heavily reduced price. Hardly given African countries a choice as the are one of the biggest buyers. This is unfair
2216 2018-04-12 20:04:55 if not a bot then IMO a shill account among many, used to promote O&G interests on twitter. things must really be heating up if they feel the need to do this, along with buying promoted content to push disinfo via profiles like “friends of science” and “oil sands action” etc

2225 2018-04-12 20:04:09 I finally have all my oil paints, and with today's 50% off coupon from Michael's I'll have the last thing I need to finally paint!!  If I get my current commission done in time, I'm going to try and paint something tonight
2226 2018-04-12 20:03:59 The claim was the US controls middle eastern oil and bombs countries that get in its way.  It's a stupid and demonstrably untrue conspiracy theory repeated by kids who get their history from youtube.

2228 2018-04-12 20:03:46 They'll be so happy when they realise we'll continue to buy oil and gas from less environmentally professional producers and that this little stunt has done nothing towards the benefit of the planet. But then most of them will be in the real world by then not hidden away at uni.
2229 2018-04-12 20:03:46 Lol Isaac. Now I have the pressure to only make super healthy stuff (which I mean, I was kind of doing)-- but like no sugar and oil etc? Sure, why not ;)
2230 2018-04-12 20:03:36 When I had long hair, I used (and sometimes still do use) coconut oil. I have naturally wavy, curly hair (it turns into a fro if I let it sit for a couple days, but not when I was actively taking care if it).

2232 2018-04-12 20:03:24 You're right.. always millions down the back of the sofa for a phoney war so you can build an oil pipeline. Course there is..  oh and look.. another few million in the cushions.. that'll buy a few jihadi training camps, er, I meant humanitarian centers.

2238 2018-04-12 20:03:01 No you won’t. Canada and the world don’t need the oil. In fact the oil you so desperately cling to IS THE SOURCE OF ALL CLIMATE CHANGE! It will end, and soon, or you will have singlehandedly destroyed the future existence of the human race. Do you not understand that?!?

2243 2018-04-12 20:02:42 It also worth noting the pipeline carries Canadian Oil. I mean that statement just makes so little sense in today’s global economy. Do you only buy things from Canadian stores that sell products “made in Canada”?

2248 2018-04-12 20:02:38 The reports says the oil is at risk of sinking when a high degree of mixing energy is available. But otherwise it floats. Also an old study -2012. So at the end of the day no one really knows what would happen in a spill that hasn't actually happened.

At the beginning of the war, US used the rebellion to overthrow Animal Assad and put a US-favorable government
2256 2018-04-12 20:01:43 No oil involved ?
2257 2018-04-12 20:01:31 Cannot begin to describe how inaccurate your statement is, the pipeline approval process was anything but strict, it was run by oil industry insiders and investors, they all stand to profit from the pipeline. They only people that have approved it stand to make money off it
2258 2018-04-12 20:01:26 So how is your protest of the Quebec Point-Daniel cement factory that will emit more GHG’s then any oilsands mine going? Or the protest against the largest coal exporter in the continent - Port of Vancouver? When will you demand foreign oil be subject to carbon regulations?
2259 2018-04-12 20:01:24 If this is the case, that would guarantee an all out Saudi-Iranian war that would devolve into a region wide slugfest between Sunni and Shia. Oil production would grind to a halt along with the world economy. I don't see the NWO supporting that.
2260 2018-04-12 20:01:24 Trump the price of oil went up $67.00. Oh gee we get to pay higher prices at gas pump. You have our back. Okie dokie.
2261 2018-04-12 20:01:23 The economy is doing better so it's time for oil to rise in price to help make sure the middle class and poor doesn't have to much money, I'm more worried about how the rich control the middle class and poor (and keep us from uniting) than I am an imaginary government deep state

2266 2018-04-12 20:01:07 @jodyvance @coryashworth I would really really like to see us refine out own oil/bitumen and not send it off shore. Cheaper oil for Canadians and alot more environmental friendly than shipping bitumen via tanker.

2269 2018-04-12 20:00:37 I thought they were intentionally coding the place where the empire was stealing natural resources as middle eastern because that’s a parallel to the real life pillaging of middle eastern oil by America.
2270 2018-04-12 20:00:28 Try and get yourself some Coconut oil, for cooking.  It’s almost tasteless and brings out the other flavours.  But also taste some of it.  Artificial coconut flavouring, sometimes is used in coconut flavours, where no coconut is used and it tastes sickly sweet for me.  But real -

2280 2018-04-12 19:59:35 I really should come up with a better retirement plan than "accidentally strike oil in the backyard while shooting at some food."
2281 2018-04-12 19:59:35 Oil highest since 2004,'thanks trump due to this syria situation
BAD BAD BAD DONALD TRUMP
2282 2018-04-12 19:59:32 This whole thing is about oil n money UN waste of space as organisation Putin just interested power n money
2283 2018-04-12 19:59:32 Shop @MeridianFoods for your nut butter .. one of the only palm oil free brands out there
2284 2018-04-12 19:59:32 Hey, oil still moving, either by pipeline, or by rail and tanker trucks, want to stop pipeline, dont do it by making more dangerous, limit demand, picket car dealerships, walmart, you see how much pdopl waste? Support alternate products made with hemp or recyclables
2285 2018-04-12 19:59:31 Sponsors in Place for @PPIHC, @AlpineBankColo @FamousDavesCO @HoosierTire @UnserKarting, Goebel Construction, Rock Valley Oil. Looking forward to getting back after a year off.
2286 2018-04-12 19:59:25 People on both sides talking like this is the end of oil in NZ; that we will wake up on Monday and be a clean green environmental paradise. Please, you're all embarrassing yourselves.
2287 2018-04-12 19:59:22 .Moving the KM pipeline forwards isn't in the interests of BC. So you are saying that you are unconcerned by indigenous and non-indigenous aspirations? Perhaps entering the discussions open to views other than big oil might be a better display of democracy?
2288 2018-04-12 19:59:20 I been dusting highlighter on me after I oil up my body for couple years now tho. Yet another idea Rihanna stole from me.
2289 2018-04-12 19:59:17 Okay! Because I’m using some I bought for hair and skin and my hair feels rly soft but I was like no duh it’s oil Haha! What is a hair mask 
2290 2018-04-12 19:59:17 Just like Iraq and Afghanistan that I’m sure are massively prosper in after the Blair days when we went in search of WMDs or oil money as it is known
2291 2018-04-12 19:59:16 Is it not true that Canada would have to pay for any spill clean up ?. Why wouldn’t the oil companies be responsible for the clean up ?.
2292 2018-04-12 19:59:08 Actually they’ve proven that they can’t be trusted to keep the oil in their pipes.
2293 2018-04-12 19:59:08 A win for the oil industry as usual not the Premier
2294 2018-04-12 19:59:05 Agreed but have zero faith Chiarelli can pull of that sort of move. I can see him moving it for a player in his late 20's and that may help the club for a yr or two. Sorry but at this stage, that kind of deal cannot happen.
2295 2018-04-12 19:59:04 Not a single oil rig or mining truck where we went.  Matter of fact, no people at all.  :-)
2296 2018-04-12 19:59:00 Because Russia want the Animal Assad oil ! 

All oil companies in Syria are Russian's one. So they try to keep him in power. They know that if this Animal is over, it will be difficult for them to keep the oil market.
2297 2018-04-12 19:58:59 Be careful with the sun. You’ll practically bake out there. Try a less harsh oil
2298 2018-04-12 19:58:58 So the US spent a trillion dollars to "control and influence" middle east oil and this explains why Chinese and French oil companies dominate Iraqi oil production?  Get in the sea.  Or better yet, stop relying on youtube for your knowledge.
2299 2018-04-12 19:58:56 We have big ol' Ravens, cutting hay we sometimes come across duck nests. Cut around them, leave an island of tall forage. It's like a neon sign for Ravens, "the nests are here, here and here.
2300 2018-04-12 19:58:42 But instead of baby oil I’ll use Almond oil...
2301 2018-04-12 19:58:33 With respect Wrong. Every Pipeline Leaks sooner later. More importantky Canada is Uniquely positioned for #RenewableEnergy. Wind. Solar. Tides. And Oil is One Generation from becoming #Coal
2302 2018-04-12 19:58:17 Oh - and he has a link to an oil/petroleum company on his page, so I guess he's all into the drilling fossil fuels/destroying the planet so we can drive big cars thing...what a winner!! 
2303 2018-04-12 19:58:11 Kim Jong UN was told to work with President Trump an china told back off nuke an work with President Trump get food open for deal  oil sell food to sell an get his people health care make them health . keep to write of agreement Kim Jong UN approve working un
2304 2018-04-12 19:57:58 The same PARTY poison a double agent and blame Russia and want to go to War with Syria because they refuse ti allow a pipe line through the country taking stolen Iraqi oil. @BillOddiesBeard
2305 2018-04-12 19:57:58 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
2306 2018-04-12 19:57:42 Buying more Canadian oil names?
2307 2018-04-12 19:57:42 Dinosaur Attempts to Justify Oil Exploration. (Ironically.)
2308 2018-04-12 19:57:27 Yes because stealing 20 trillion dollars in gold and 30 trillion dollars worth of oil from Iraq is not much! Not to mention libya and what they are trying to do in Northern Syria please just stop
2309 2018-04-12 19:57:25 @radionz guess we can’t blame oil gas lobbyists for being grumpy. But nice to hear him effectively admit that the 11k number is at best, speculative and worst, total BS.
2310 2018-04-12 19:57:19 Too bad he did not do the same for the Peace River Valley. This is not left unnoticed by NL’s whose rich renewable continental shelf is the home to oil development that now is needed to pay off a hydro dam boondoggle. Sad irony when you size it up. We have no choice, drill away!
2311 2018-04-12 19:57:17 Pipeone not on for at least another year or two, in 50 years, hundreds of oil frieghters each year, zero incidents, improved coast guard, ships etc will lessen risk, oil will still be shipped to port via rail pipeline or not, so not changing anything stopping pipeline
2312 2018-04-12 19:57:05 it goes on to further challenge the fresh water assumption that is doesn't sink with this "However, the study acknowledged that the tests were conducted in a synthesized environment, and it's possible that oil products could behave differently in the natural environment."

2315 2018-04-12 19:56:55 Fuck i already miss my nucks and my oil
2316 2018-04-12 19:56:54 Can you please do this screen shot as at today, inflation, MPR, exchange rate all higher even though oil price is now $72
2317 2018-04-12 19:56:51 On the outside? You basically just use it as the oil to brown the bread.
2318 2018-04-12 19:56:48 A small amount Coconut or caster oil. Caster is great for reducing inflammation, they both have antibacterial properties as well
2319 2018-04-12 19:56:38 “... by 2025 the shale revolution will have unlocked more oil and gas in America more quickly than in any other country, including Saudi Arabia in its heyday from 1966 to 1981.”
2320 2018-04-12 19:56:35 Ayand, let’s not forget the deal; wasn’t it The Saudis that recently wanted $80 oil, look where oil is going now; meh, prolly just a coincidence.
2321 2018-04-12 19:56:33 I just rubbed rosemary oil all over my face and my life got significantly better.
2322 2018-04-12 19:56:25 Hot oil treatment for my hair when I get home
2323 2018-04-12 19:56:22 I agree with that from that standpoint that Rounds 1 & 2 have a much, much higher % chance of contributing.  But if you can turn it into an NHL-equivalent, under-25, under-contract piece, I think you have to consider that.
2324 2018-04-12 19:56:19 USA role in Venezuela is huge, just because they want to take Oil for free,
2325 2018-04-12 19:56:13 BP spill cost 20 times that and an oil tanker full of dilbit sinking in the burrard inlet would be even more severe than that. Sorry but it’s not worth it. Might I suggest building it to the East coast? Apparently Eastern provinces are very supportive

2329 2018-04-12 19:55:46 It's not an oil spill, it's a bitumen spill and they're not treated the same way. You have no plan.
2330 2018-04-12 19:55:42 I've only recently got into suits.. I've just reached the part after the Hessington Oil, Derby/scott debacle.
2331 2018-04-12 19:55:28 The Pep Boys lift my large body up on a hydraulic lift and drain my gender fluid into an oil pan
2332 2018-04-12 19:55:22 Lmao!  "Canada Oil and Rape Seed" =  Interesting combination?
2333 2018-04-12 19:55:16 Baklava costs 5 times as much as petrol. So even after the Middle East runs out of oil, colonialists will be invading the region for the baklava
2334 2018-04-12 19:55:15 There’s a sign on the door that says thank you for not smoking and the guy changing my oil is smoking and I just
2335 2018-04-12 19:55:14 Bullyhunters worries me because they're selling merchandise to support their work before they even know if it's effective. It reeks of a sales pitch in the worst, snake oil sort of way
2336 2018-04-12 19:55:11 yes but a great many members of the NEB have history of working for large oil companies, go figure. No wait it does make sense
2337 2018-04-12 19:55:09 To attack or not to attack Syria.  That's the question.  Oil may have been manipulated higher when considering the SPIKES higher on sudden heavy volume.  I would be a sell on a dip below 6500 in May... spot month which expires soon.  Roller-coaster day for sure!!!
2338 2018-04-12 19:55:08 Control and influence over the oil and who it supplies........ pretty much the same as owning it.

2342 2018-04-12 19:54:46 these taxes are to oil the wheels during the 'referendum'
2343 2018-04-12 19:54:41 I voted Trump, partially based on his non-interventionist stance on Syria. So, I guess it doesn’t matter whom we put in as the nwo “war machine” gobbles up all. We will see. This is all about oil pipelines anyway and not empathy for gassed victims.
2344 2018-04-12 19:54:26 Now you’ve destroyed their futures I suppose the farming sector is next. Just wondering how @jamespeshaw will get to his next climate conference. Not on an oil powered plane I hope! @Pandasport @TheMusterShow @TheCountry @FedFarmers
2345 2018-04-12 19:54:20 You have no plan... 

"The Government of Canada will fund improved RESEARCH capacity to SEEK safe, reliable, and more effective technologies to clean up oil spills...RESEARCH into new clean-up technologies...investments will fund RESEARCH to HELP improve emergency response..."
2346 2018-04-12 19:54:17 You bet but who's kidding who man, the chances of 77 still being around are probably no better than 50/50
2347 2018-04-12 19:54:13 Thank you America for being in Syria and not letting Russia and Iran to grab all the tterritory and all oil fields. ISIS has been there, you destroyed some, which is also great. But you are very indecisive when it comes to opposing Asad backed by Russia. Does Mr Putin have you?
2348 2018-04-12 19:54:07 should just regulate pressure and everything above the fitting will come out.  oil in the system lower than the fitting shouldn't
2349 2018-04-12 19:54:06 Middle East or Africa the West are there for Oil and other resources. Local population being killed en mass is collateral damage.

Energy is not the same thing as electricity. Globally oil is barely used in electricity generation and yet in total world primary energy oil is in first place.

2355 2018-04-12 19:53:26 Not oil. Natural gas pipelines
2356 2018-04-12 19:53:24 'Thank you' for what exactly? Supporting oil greedy terror and unequal and unfair representation of the people  in the region for decades? No thanks.
2357 2018-04-12 19:53:21 Mitch since when I don’t think you have actually done the PEOPLES business since maybe the 70’s or 80’s and not sure then but I was too young to know! All you do is snake oil sales and get rich that includes you and everyone else except maybe 2-3

2362 2018-04-12 19:53:09 Only issue is that the oil price has to remain low..
2363 2018-04-12 19:53:06 i need some tea tree oil and more aloe vera 
2364 2018-04-12 19:52:52 Put in a government of yes men,  puppets that will do whatever the big oil tycoons running our country want. puppets are already in place for all the oil fields in Iraq, now they need all the shipping routes.
2365 2018-04-12 19:52:49 There are two options I think. Capsule and liquid that could squirt into your mouth. Look at Charlotte’s Web Hemp oil.
2366 2018-04-12 19:52:33 Oklahoma is a mess. All that oil/gas money pouring out of the state, while the regular people struggle and live with earthquakes because of the fracking. Heartbreaking.
2367 2018-04-12 19:52:31 all the oil that's higher than the fitting 
2368 2018-04-12 19:52:11 rip to your oil portfolio
2369 2018-04-12 19:52:09 This is not back pedaling just pointing out exactly what was said getting clear as it were Don't forget he plays his hand close to his chest We would be foolish to intervene at this moment as would Russia We are also forgetting this is over oil & sadly here are no holds barred
2370 2018-04-12 19:52:05 The best and also worst, time to clean a deep fat fryer, is whilst the oil is still 190°c. Exceptionally high risk of burning all your flesh off. Yet here we are.
2371 2018-04-12 19:51:56 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
2372 2018-04-12 19:51:50 g'day fellas, tried Goanna oil on my buggered knee for the joint pain, it didn't work for me but perhaps I didn't believe @belungerer 
2373 2018-04-12 19:51:50 Guys, you are dressed for work in that stunning suit with a crisp white shirt looking all dapper, you are set to leave and due to a misunderstanding, your wife pours palm oil all over you.. Whatchu gonna do?
2374 2018-04-12 19:51:49 Time to stock up on flour, rice, cooking oil etc. 
In fact most dried goods and tins. 
It’s going to be a long winter- if we’re not nuked in Scotland before that. 
2375 2018-04-12 19:51:48 Pushing for war.. It serves British interests to murder millions for oil and gas
2376 2018-04-12 19:51:38 Lmao I put on baby oil all over my body before I get out the shower. My favorite in-shower moisturizer  This is a good idea tho I should add some rose gold highlight

2378 2018-04-12 19:51:16 That may well be & the sooner the better,but it's years away & until then gas & oil will be imported, eg Russia
2379 2018-04-12 19:51:07 PM @NarendraModi bats for responsible energy pricing by oil producing countries
2380 2018-04-12 19:51:07 When you've stopped laughing you can still tell me which countries the US bombed and now controls its oil.
2381 2018-04-12 19:51:02 But that still doesn't answer the question of why provincial governments wanting to put economic stress on Canadian citizens, in spite of people opposing the oil industry. That's something a dictatorship would do...

2383 2018-04-12 19:51:00 As I recall, the rattle his cage race was later - when Dale spun Terry and Dale won (that was after Terry spun in DW’s oil, got new tires, charged back, BUMPED THE SHIT OUT OF DALE, and took the lead again) - that’s when Dale tried to rattle his cage (quote from VL).
2384 2018-04-12 19:50:57 What is Couillard doing about the largest emitter in his province, the Point-Daniel cement plant, that will dwarf any oil sands mine in Alberta? #hypocrisy
2385 2018-04-12 19:50:55 Not baby oil though love. You’ll fry. Try almond or sunflower seed oil
2386 2018-04-12 19:50:54 #oil #wti. Appears Chinese tariffs are not resolved. Not even close.
2387 2018-04-12 19:50:49 The man is a F*CKING (pardon the swearing) LEGEND! Let's hope he is not steered into another proxy war for oil and shale in SYRIA. Just read my TL. Not rocket science.
2388 2018-04-12 19:50:45 The fat in mayo - from eggs and oil - with crisp up a grilled cheese, but c'mon!
Butter!
2389 2018-04-12 19:50:24 Oil industry weeping tears about their feelings, and consultation,  and what not, would have a stranger base to stand on if they hadn't lied for all them years about what their own scientists were telling them.
2390 2018-04-12 19:50:19 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
2391 2018-04-12 19:50:19 Not oil. Natural gas. We also want it badly for natural gas as does Saudi Arabia, Turkey snd Qatar. Biggest guns win.
2392 2018-04-12 19:50:13 "Canada Oil"= Ewwww....!

2394 2018-04-12 19:50:09 someone i know has an oil furnace. how much does oil cost per whatever buckets or something that you buy it in to heat up the house?
2395 2018-04-12 19:50:08 Mine was like that when I stopped washing it daily but after a few weeks it stopped producing so much oil and adjusted. It was nice cause I could just throw it up in a bun on greasy days but you can’t lol

2400 2018-04-12 19:49:38 Oil execs where in NZ in #2008 just in case Labour did win back then. This is not an 'Adern Ministry' ... it's a hijacked mess.
2401 2018-04-12 19:49:37 Coconut oil literally saved my skin. I use it as a moisturizer and I only use a little since it does a good job at spreading. I also use it on my son, who suffers with eczema. Works wonders for us.
2402 2018-04-12 19:49:36 Indonesia doesn't have an oil pipeline running through the middle of it and they already have a Rothschild central bank.
2403 2018-04-12 19:49:35 Can we drop the ridiculous pretense that this regime change has anything at all to do with human and what is best for Syrian citizens, please?  We know it's just oil and geopolitics. And the chemical attack was probably faked to further the "7 countries in 5 yrs" agenda.
2404 2018-04-12 19:49:25 Crows too
2405 2018-04-12 19:49:20 In the north, the show is called “My Name is Oil”
2406 2018-04-12 19:49:19 To top my day off, I get a B.S. "press release" from some anti-ethanol group that constitutes two people I've never heard of, probably flush from cash from the oil industry.

2408 2018-04-12 19:49:13 Scott Pruitt is not only abusing taxpayers money by making all these ridiculous demands, he basically has sold out the environment in favor of the energy and oil companies that have given him millions in campaign donations.
2409 2018-04-12 19:49:08 gun oil for all!
2410 2018-04-12 19:49:05 Could care less...would rather have a GM that has something to say and higher ups who hold him accountable for the job he does.
2411 2018-04-12 19:49:03 @cathmckenna obsession with oil pipelines is nuts. Never seen such an oil fanatic
2412 2018-04-12 19:49:03 I told Petra I had to get an oil change and she said “okay I’ll go pick you up” .... ok sis 
2413 2018-04-12 19:48:58 There are two different threats transporting oil. By rail, higher accident rate BUT less product is lost. By pipeline, huge loss of product into environment, but fewer spills. In some corridors, rail is cheaper. Real issue: how long will we continue to use this amount of oil?
2414 2018-04-12 19:48:51 Which circle of hell is it again when you’re waiting for an oil change in a room with a soap opera playing at top volume on an overhead TV and a cell phone conversation taking place  on speaker?
2415 2018-04-12 19:48:48 Why is our Govt considering military action against Assad for unproven CW attack yet didnt consider attacking Russia for unproven CW attack on UK soil or expel Islamic clerics following actual terrorism?

Answer = UK Govt doesnt give a shit about its citizens only gas and oil.
2416 2018-04-12 19:48:38 The war mongers just want the Oil on the Golan Heights
2417 2018-04-12 19:48:37 Yep. There have been too many “oil” spills.
2418 2018-04-12 19:48:27 and ask his sorry a$$ why he supports the import of oil from Venezuela corrupt African states and  Middle East countries
2419 2018-04-12 19:48:26 I think it’s a four-way tie between tempura, flowers, herb oil and meat bonbons for this year’s #masterchefuk “thing.”
2420 2018-04-12 19:48:25 Salty because 90% of BBW products are now made with coconut oil. What’s a girl to do when she’s allergic to coconuts 
2421 2018-04-12 19:48:24 Like Libya? Where the like of the Manchester bombers family known jihadists were backed by Britain. And the winners were oil companies.
2422 2018-04-12 19:48:23 you pinch it with a clean needle, and then pop it with paper around your fingers until there is no liquid coming out anymore (ew) then add some tea tree oil, let it dry and put coconut oil over it to heal it fast
2423 2018-04-12 19:48:17 No disrespect, but isn't some of Norway's current success due to it's oil reserves having been exploited well and the sovereign wealth from them having been used well? I am sure hard work was also part of the success, along with social welfare and education investment....?
2424 2018-04-12 19:48:02 Golan. Heights. Oil.
2425 2018-04-12 19:48:01 I could go on and on about Obama and the oil fields you stated or even about arming ISIS cause technically the US did but it gets more complicated. It’s just western media doesn’t show everything unless they want to, like the oil fields obama knew just didnt act till later on
2426 2018-04-12 19:47:57 Or find an oil chemist who is a member like I did....Very important to understand it is not just edible oils AOCS members make.A lot of industrial uses for seed oils.We have only been eating canola since the 1970's. It was considered unsafe once...
2427 2018-04-12 19:47:57 Oil tankers move faster

2431 2018-04-12 19:47:31 @ElegantInsights Ooh have you worn such what oil did you diffuse?
2432 2018-04-12 19:47:28 Actually, cannabis appears to have a protective effect on the lungs, per research. Interesting!
And, injected CBD oil may help to lessen the effects of COPD!
2433 2018-04-12 19:47:19 As if the Oil and Gas Industry were ignorant of effects of climate change and the drive by Global Energy Companies to move into Green Energy Production.
2434 2018-04-12 19:47:14 Finally got my oil changed
2435 2018-04-12 19:46:56 I am not saying it's god enough, don't get me wrong. But I am citing why I think they make the playoffs. Are there ifs, sure? but when some of those are cleaned-up injuriesie 2 and 77 then I'm gonna bet that takes a positive bounce
2436 2018-04-12 19:46:52 The truth is they were selling their oil in their own currency and the US Attacks every country that won't sell their oil in US dollars. Why Syria and Iran ? Because they also don't use the US Dollar. Been around a while and know the game.
2437 2018-04-12 19:46:51 I just bought a cool new conch seashell!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2438 2018-04-12 19:46:46 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2439 2018-04-12 19:46:35 @THEPACOSHOW Paco, do you use beard oil on the beautiful man fur?
2440 2018-04-12 19:46:34 So tell me Maram, these genius Americans... Which country did they bomb and subsequently get "oil and power".  Update: the US is self-sufficient in fossil fuels.
2441 2018-04-12 19:46:32 @syria_true My think tank know what I do.  You guys do not need a proxy war for oil and shale while kids die. @KremlinRussia_E @POTUS @UNICEF @UN I'll speak plainly.

Refine oil for domestic use, create Sustainable oil jobs!! Diversify! Climate change gives you great opp to grow soy & corn for export.
2454 2018-04-12 19:45:15 Third: Yes stay the hell out of our countries and stop acting like the police of the world and mind your own business! The US has bombed tens of countries for nothing but oil and power! Speaking of invading a country for "humanitarian" reasons is laughable.
2455 2018-04-12 19:44:54 Even though it was clear that we were not going to win that war Reagan - r was a war hawk and probably would have liked to start a war Bush one and Bush 2 both started irresponsible Wars for oil Bush 2 then proceeded on to Afghanistan Obama didn't stop it and now it's been 11yrs

2468 2018-04-12 19:43:27 I homeschool my son. We learn about science not religion. The two don't mix. It's like oil and water.
2469 2018-04-12 19:43:25 It's also worth noting that the oil it will transport is not American, the people it will employ are Canadian and the Canadian pipeline solutions were cancelled or made untenable by our current federal government.
2470 2018-04-12 19:43:23 Has anyone tried @IAMSAFAREE coconut oil? Any feedback?
2471 2018-04-12 19:43:21 @BP_plc help.. oil spill in my kitchen. What do I do?
2472 2018-04-12 19:43:13 @CatherineBizTV There are many smarter oil people in the world than Jeff Currie. Next time do your homework.
2473 2018-04-12 19:43:10 Industries such as the palm oil industry have caused deforestation and habitat loss for endangered species. However, we can make a difference by opting to only buy products that contain palm oil if it was produced with sustainable farming practices! #Etownpops
2474 2018-04-12 19:43:04 wait, salt and olive oil too though right. with ciabatta.
2475 2018-04-12 19:43:04 michael you have a great heart but are incredibly naive and misinformed. Gadaffi's overthrow has led massively to europe's migrant crisis with blacks being sold there as slaves openly now.he spread the oil wealth of his country around incredibly well .
2476 2018-04-12 19:42:47 Cinnamon is my favourite but use a lot of coconut oil as well
2477 2018-04-12 19:42:44 100% and expecting a bounce back from those guys isn't farfetched. McDavid will always give them a chance at the post-season but you are right, for him to be entering year four & the Oilers being a "maybe" playoff team is scary as hell.
2478 2018-04-12 19:42:41 Garbage.  Almost all of those killed were murdered by Iraqis and various Islamist fanatics.  If the US "looted" the country how come it cost over a trillion dollars and all the oil companies now there are either Chinese or French?
2479 2018-04-12 19:42:39 I'd love some God Oil!
2480 2018-04-12 19:42:13 Sincerely believe that the abundance of Oil and Gas spills and abandoned environmental clean-up jobs should not be calculated as job creation stats. Product delivered stands alone on job creation stats; spill cleanups are not JOB CREATION.
2481 2018-04-12 19:42:09 I have never came across such a Lunatic in my entire life. He should shut up and tell God to return the oil to Jigawa.

2483 2018-04-12 19:41:55 @JohnArnoldFndtn hello sir can you please help me about crude oil trading.
2484 2018-04-12 19:41:55 We should focus on courting clean tech and tech companies, not oil companies. Natural resource exploitation is even worse when it's done by invading companies. Canadian oil should be produced, refined and sold in Canada, by Canadian companies.
2485 2018-04-12 19:41:45 Hells yeah, call it out!  Shine a light on it, point at it, whatever it takes.  If it saves one person from falling for snake oil and getting themselves in trouble back home, it's worth it!

Unless it's MY snake oil (See previous tweet).  Then... be cool, man!
2486 2018-04-12 19:41:10 If you have our backs why are you letting oil companies raise the prices by 30%? I thought you deregulated so prices go down?
2487 2018-04-12 19:41:05 I hope some understanding can be reached so that the UK continues to have a secure source of oil.

2502 2018-04-12 19:39:59 If you want foreign companies to decide whether or not they dump toxic sludge in your backyard or destroy your fishing community by building oil rigs, congrats trumps considering it.
2503 2018-04-12 19:39:35 Not a significant amount of oil in Syria either, especially since there is a worldwide glut of oil.
2504 2018-04-12 19:39:31 yawa oh bantay bitaw ug mangamong ka ugma sa iyang atubangan yab-an jud tikag tanduay na naay used oil HAHAHAHA
2505 2018-04-12 19:39:28 Madam, you are one of few Nigerians I respect. But your raw isolated inflation data conceals the truth. An import dependent economy with depleted fx reserves by 2015 amidst oil boom cannot avoid biting inflation thereafter.
2506 2018-04-12 19:39:27 That, or it was a slow oil news week.
2507 2018-04-12 19:39:24 Oil doing the defending like a pro does! Commentators sounding super surprised! even though we know he does it all the time
2508 2018-04-12 19:39:21 You can not put out a fire with oil . You can’t mend a broken egg
2509 2018-04-12 19:39:09 Yeah, I've been drowning myself in lavender oil at night so I can manage to get some sleep. Advil has more or less been helping. Dulls the pain so it's just tolerable. ♡
2510 2018-04-12 19:38:54 i’ve gotten my oil change 3 times since i’ve bought it. tell me why this is the first time they check our air filter thingy or whatever & there’s a freakin’ rats nest in it  i been breathing that shit in for months now 
2511 2018-04-12 19:38:47 I know. The oil will be just in time for the warmer weather.
2512 2018-04-12 19:38:47 I am highly considering #CBD oil for my PTSD/depression/anxiety but it’s a little pricey. So has anyone tried it & does it actually work?
2513 2018-04-12 19:38:37 I need a oil change ASAP.

2518 2018-04-12 19:38:06 Note, when frying eggs, don’t dip your finger in the hot oil.
2519 2018-04-12 19:37:58 Recent, small randomized controlled human trials showed that lavendar essential oil massage benefitted stress levels in pregnant women, and arthritic knee pain. But hard to have a good placebo control for aromas--lavender is very distinguishable.
2520 2018-04-12 19:37:46 Let’s put more trucks on road to haul oil and fuel because they don’t want a pipeline !!!!!!!!!?????????

2522 2018-04-12 19:37:43 I’m the dummy? Hope ya don’t use an internal combustion engine for anything. Gasoline prices will sky rocket in Vancouver after Alberta enacts legislation stemming the flow of oil to BC. By the way, how does that subsidy for the LNG plant sit with ya?

2530 2018-04-12 19:36:44 Dont disaagree at all. There’s a large part of this that is about making sure there isnt a second term for Trump. There’s also a large part of this that Trump brought on himself. Squeeky wheel gets the oil = Crazy man talking shit to media/intelligence gets the scrutiny.

2533 2018-04-12 19:36:37 It looks like this can be done in a crockpot, and then the oil could be frozen into cubes after, and defrosted to use again for the next batch. This looks like a great way to do chicken!
2534 2018-04-12 19:36:33 There are abundant alternatives for gas and crude oil in Eastern Canada, as well as refineries.  Not the case for petroleum products in B.C.  Energy East pipeline made limited economic sense.

2536 2018-04-12 19:36:15 @syria_true Russia seen sense. Hopefully @theresa_may wont do a TONY BLAIR and have another proxy war for OIL+SHALE.  Her advisors suck tbh. @BrugesGroup ME FP seems to be drawn on back of a fag packet these days. @BorisJohnson
2537 2018-04-12 19:36:08 For sure & the thing is with the kind of $ they are going to be dishing out to 97 & 29, not to mention others, these mid to late 1st and/or 2nd round picks are going to be essential. The mid to late round picks are certainly nice when they come along but the 1st/2nd are musts.

2541 2018-04-12 19:35:57 Capitalism forced Venezuela into becoming a rentier state in which its economy was solely dependent on the sale of Oil. Powerful nations decide wether or not that oil gets sold so when they said no, Venezuela fell to shambles. Socialism works, the U.S. and Capitalism sucks.
2542 2018-04-12 19:35:57 Why do I go to @jiffylube Northgate for an oil change? They vacuum my floor mats! It's the little things that matter!!
2543 2018-04-12 19:35:51 Criticise National and ACT for their crap about oil exploration, and the dumping-on starts: where do you think the raw materials in your mobile phone came from? What are the vanes on wind turbines made of? These people are just - aaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
2544 2018-04-12 19:35:43 I'm always sceptical of using breakeven calcs for multidecadal investments. Even if the numbers a relatively correct, the highly variable lead times from exploration, to appraisal, to FID, to first oil, etc. etc. makes it a weak indicator of near-to-mid term supply.
2545 2018-04-12 19:35:40 Does coconut oil actually help your hair or is just the fact that oil is on my hair that feels soft

2549 2018-04-12 19:35:19 So I just got mt first oil change and lemme tell you I'm never doing it myself again.
2550 2018-04-12 19:35:06 Carbon dating allows us to track CO2 patterns and climate trends across the span of history... yes it is a cycle but humans are accelerating the process. Why would we lie about this? We have to move from coal and oil anyway bc there are only so many reserves.
2551 2018-04-12 19:34:56 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.

2558 2018-04-12 19:34:25 Why are you retweeting this hull hour???? Shameful. Could risk health. Not scientifically proven, a scam.  Snake oil seller. Shame on you! Abs ARE NOT made in the kitchen. As a health professional & registered dietitian I appalled.
2559 2018-04-12 19:34:21 The mechanic just gave me his discount so my oil change was only 25$ 
2560 2018-04-12 19:34:15 Nope not good enough. There have been too many oil spill accidents to believe that these pipelines are foolproof. Also they disturb wildlife and habitat in a major way.
2561 2018-04-12 19:34:12 Baby oil in the sun isn't good for the skin though? Right? Like wouldn't the person get all burnt ???
2562 2018-04-12 19:34:09 KAMLOOPS!! you have a beautiful city full of Oil and Gas workers that work in northern BC and Alberta. Flush this turd out of city council next election.
2563 2018-04-12 19:34:08 Gotta wait 2hrs for an oil change and alignment. Save me
2564 2018-04-12 19:34:07 The scent would be easy to cover with an essential oil combo or something of that nature as an option if you dont enjoy the powder smell
2565 2018-04-12 19:34:07 Check out "Zion Oil &Gas" on wiki; they drill for oil, in Israel, based on how they interpret the Bible. Spoiler alert: they've been unsuccessful since their founding in 2000...

2595 2018-04-12 19:31:57 Some really good divergence in oil.
2596 2018-04-12 19:31:54 $CRZO sounds like chorizo which I like. Large short interest that as brought the price down for me, which also I like. Most of the oil production in Eagle Ford priced closer to Brent, which I like the most. As with $SN

2599 2018-04-12 19:31:40 There’s huge concerns of  CH4 plumes released from ocean floors as a result of warming oceans as well. Also, from the permafrost in the North Artic all shadow over the Oil & Gas industry CH4 contributions. Maybe the Oil & Gas Industry could figure out how to harvest ocean CH4.

My question, will Garner resign if he is found to be a total arse, again?
2621 2018-04-12 19:29:47 ...that was before they knew about his failure to disclose his business’ ties to a Chinese government oil and gas company in the questionnaire he was required to fill out to be confirmed as CIA director by the Senate. #StopPompeo #TheREALswamp

2625 2018-04-12 19:29:41 Well, a mix of pipeline, truck, rail, and maritime -- but in much smaller quantities than if we were exporting Oil Sands production to, say, China.
2626 2018-04-12 19:29:40 Even if @TheOklahoman and Pruitt didn't always get along, their editorial board is a mouthpiece for the oil companies. Just like Pruitt.

2632 2018-04-12 19:28:59 Thee fact that I need an oil change every month is a problem.

2636 2018-04-12 19:28:48 Oh, Alioli shouldn't be the same! Alioli actually means "Garlic and oil" in Catalan and it's made out of that. The flavor and ingredients of "Golf Sauce" and "Alioli" should be widely different

2646 2018-04-12 19:28:03 I would hesitate to guess but yesteryear's versions wouldnt have palm oil and would not have as much sugar in them as todays versions. Plus lots of other "things"

2650 2018-04-12 19:27:36 Good stuff. So when Gas hits a minimum of $2 a litre, people lose their jobs because oil and gas=bad, and the prices of everything drastically increases (Hope you like your $50 steak!), we can all be satisfied, and starving and homeless. BC will be CANCELLED.
2651 2018-04-12 19:27:36 2/3 years is probably right but if the plan is to grow this into any kind of sustained presence among the better teams in the league, how important is that potential piece moving forward with the Oilers current lot in life? Hard to consider moving that pick, JP or Yamamoto.
2652 2018-04-12 19:27:34 That is simply a denial of statistics. All pipelines can fail, and this one is no different. And a denial of public input. Beyond that, it's simply time, time to invest in renewables, not oil. It's 2018 after all.

2677 2018-04-12 19:24:46 Well in the Christian lifestyle, a person that has a relationship with God in a relationship with Someone who Doesn’t is called being Unequally yoked, And Those 2 people shouldn’t be together, it’s like oil and water, light and dark, it don’t mix
2678 2018-04-12 19:24:42 Baby oil helps get the perfect tan 
2679 2018-04-12 19:24:33 i never knew u were supposed to use butter for grilled cheese, mostly bc we use olive oil and not butter to cook with
2680 2018-04-12 19:24:31 Al Gore is a fraud. Snake oil salesman.
2681 2018-04-12 19:24:08 Lmao. Black people be beautiful without oil as well you know
2682 2018-04-12 19:24:03 My theory (based on any info I can get--I don't rely on @MSM) is that Russia is seeing that our allies are building up in numbers and Putin probably won't want to die on that hill. He already has all the oil he needs.
2683 2018-04-12 19:23:56 Look.....British Columbia mainly exports oil, coal and sewage and they're not going to start exporting even more oil now.  They have principles.
2684 2018-04-12 19:23:51 I would argue that blocking a pipeline to pander to your base is equally childish and hypocritical, particularly when you are accepting Saudi oil tankers and dumping raw sewage into waters off the coast of Victoria. Where's your outrage for that?
2685 2018-04-12 19:23:49 i can't cry bc i'm using expensive serum and face oil but i can't stop crying shsjdjdjd
2686 2018-04-12 19:23:47 ah good tip  i really would have used straight baby oil
2687 2018-04-12 19:23:45 Sounds like a start.  My predicted Syrian response: will the US guarantee that Israel will not attack Syria afterwards? Will the US, Turkey and others leave Syria? Will the US restore Syrian oil areas to Syria?
2688 2018-04-12 19:23:34 FFS its Fake There was no Gas attack even a blind man could see that, Its all about the Oil Pipe line, Money Power All Tories are Vermin of Society
2689 2018-04-12 19:23:29 Propylene glycol, glycerine and flavours. Hardly unknown. It's made in labs, not extracted from crude oil.
The ingredients are about as benign as you can find.
2690 2018-04-12 19:23:26 As ive been saying for oil, the magnet of 50% fib in play and oil at 67.5 is beaut short opening position IMO. We are here now. the time is coming
2691 2018-04-12 19:23:21 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
2692 2018-04-12 19:23:05 I’m telling you, lemon juice and coconut oil. Also, make sure you’re taking vitamins cause it can be an hormone imbalance as well
2693 2018-04-12 19:23:04 The end of the petrodollar, trillions and trillions of them will come flooding home, causing massive inflation, massive drop in USD, gold skyrocketing, and drop in oil price to China along with rising oil price to Saudi, yuan reserve currency, etc.

2724 2018-04-12 19:20:21 Why oil; I think oil is the best media for hyperrealism. Plus it is the slowest drying of them all so they have a lot of time to adjust the tiniest details. (Someone correct me if I am wrong, I never used oil)

2726 2018-04-12 19:20:15 You could attract a lot of investments from morally conscious investors if we stood up for our environment instead of selling out for a plan full of risks. Still havent heard any reasons why we dont refine it ourselves instead of importing oil.
2727 2018-04-12 19:20:13 By stealing our tax money at every turn to give themselves a very embellished lifestyle, subsidize oil companies, hand out money to their rich friends and corporations who were already using loopholes to keep from paying taxes by same percentage as everyone else & taking from us.

2762 2018-04-12 19:16:50 Not in any way. He is connected to oil, pipelines, has advisors of such companies and until recently pro harsh immg enforcement to name a few. He also ducks debates with bs excuses. Reminds me of a certain someone expecting a coronation...
2763 2018-04-12 19:16:22 I'm looking to replace my 20-year old Civic, but I feel disloyal. This little car refuses to give up on me.

2766 2018-04-12 19:16:08 Do you know the difference between conventional and unconventional oil? Do you understand the royalty regime in AB? Do you understand federal transfer payments? Selecting unconventional companies to say foreign interests are the only parties who benefit from pline is incorrect.
2767 2018-04-12 19:16:07 Such a big lie! Despite being Orcas favourite there are more Maui Dolphin with oil exploration than before

From 53 in 2008 to 75 in 2017

The reason is a coalition Govt with a few crazy greenies trading this for compulsory unions
2768 2018-04-12 19:16:07 He wants French oil companies access to Syrian oil fields like Total is now exploiting Libyan oil. Killing Syrians in that process doesn't matter. Supporting jihadists is ok too.
2769 2018-04-12 19:16:02 US and KSA via Taliban and Daesh are collectively after the oil and minerals of middle east as well as the nukes of Pakistan. Using India as proxy. West and Wahabs are not able to digest growth of Pakistan courtesy China and Russia.
2770 2018-04-12 19:15:58 U.S. Elites know that there's no Arab Country that can stand up 2 Russia and win. The U.S. is the only thing standing in the way of Russia taking, Saudi Arabia's oil, Dubai, Oman etc. Thus, Creating A choke hold on american oil imports & business interest.

2772 2018-04-12 19:15:55 I haven’t been doing my hair at all. I have it up or just lose down but I feel awkward because it’s puffy and straight from the bottom.  I’m gonna try to coconut oil on my hair and only natural shampoos. Any recommendations???
2773 2018-04-12 19:15:50 The risks were not "studied" adequately.  There would not be the spills that there are if the risks were studied adequately.   I'm a bit taken aback by you calling your neighbours drug traffickers, that's pretty low ball.  Is oil and gas going to lead to prosperity?
2774 2018-04-12 19:15:48 yes it is. the natural oil of the scalp takes longer to travel down the hair if it's curly or coily

You’ve put your political life first by pandering to the greens. I assume you’ll be walking to the meeting? Right, your flying using oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@jwiechers

2782 2018-04-12 19:14:56 The most boring thing ever is sitting & waiting for your oil to be changed 
2783 2018-04-12 19:14:51 But the big thing is #Oil right now, not #Coal......only one hot button opportunist issue at a time please!....
2784 2018-04-12 19:14:40 The best way to punish Russia is to not buy their oil and gas.  Oil money pays for their organized crime state.
2785 2018-04-12 19:14:37 Your statement rests on the assumption that no oil and gas exploration (or production) elsewhere will replace what would have been done here. Your statement is only correct if that assumption is correct.
2786 2018-04-12 19:14:37 If it were possible to engineer oil field development protections that would prevent negative impacts to indigenous habitats of the arctic, the corporations involved would not choose, and could not afford, to engineer those protections. Instead, 100%risk is put on the indigenous.
2787 2018-04-12 19:14:29 Don’t do anything to it. Don’t put anything on it & if you do try to use natural products. Chemicals can be very harsh in hair. I literally wear a bun every day & when I have my hair down I usually just put coconut oil or a natural leave in fit moisture but aside from that
2788 2018-04-12 19:14:28 Once that is done, let’s start the process again for the Trans Canada Pipeline project. Atlantic Canadians deserve this and need it to boost our economy. It will also help drive the nations economy marketing our oil to Europe.
2789 2018-04-12 19:14:18 Yesss sis glow  I just made some with grapeseed oil, glycerin and mango and vanilla oil!
2790 2018-04-12 19:14:08 -Lowest unemployment rate in 40 years.
-Leading the G7 in economic growth. 
-Highest oil production levels in Canadian history. 

You were saying?

2792 2018-04-12 19:14:05 Started the cut grass today. Only did the backyard because it was higher. I’ll do the front Saturday. I’m happy because the mower started on the 3rd pull after only priming once and changing the oil.

2797 2018-04-12 19:13:36 You do realize that asphalt is produced from the distillation of crude oil right? And what are roads made of? Crude oil is distilled at the refinery to yield several different products. So if you stop fossil fuel production, the cost to rebuild roads will SKYROCKET.
2798 2018-04-12 19:13:33 So after the petro-dollar collapse that destroyed their economy, their aim is to make millions of Canadians suffer who don't agree with oil tycoon business? Which in turn will make millions more Canadians suffer? Pretty sound logic there.

Money dividing people is childish
2799 2018-04-12 19:13:29 I know its olive oil to be a beam of buns of beak
2800 2018-04-12 19:13:29 How? I am saying that if you only focus on oilsands companies you are ignoring the other companies and stakeholders who benefit from the higher price AB will receive for oil produced here. You're twisting the facts to support your side.
2801 2018-04-12 19:13:28 They’ve found plenty of oil for a company of this size. Permian assets haven’t been rated yet.

However #NTOG used #WTI as its benchmark not #Brent
2802 2018-04-12 19:13:27 Done with the 20 stalls hotvwalker. I don't want to look at my foot. I was sick to my stomach this morning put a fee drops peppermint oil on my stomach and felt better shortly afterwards.
2803 2018-04-12 19:13:19 Damn i need to go to Houston to get a oil change before the next time i go home
2804 2018-04-12 19:13:18 Totally off topic but is @CadburyUK Ireland using palm oil or something in its Easter eggs .. there’s a weird lingering taste that is not the traditional Cadbury taste
2805 2018-04-12 19:13:17 Stop killing innocent people for oil, what the hell is wrong with America; stop brainwashing people to think that Russia and Syria are the enemies when it's actually YOUR COUNTRY (America).
2806 2018-04-12 19:13:09 Before and after pics? If I’m gonna pay $20 for a jar of coconut oil it better be better than the rest. Do you have samples?
2807 2018-04-12 19:13:08 And a second time I answered and said to him, "What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out?"  (Zechariah 4:12,)
#TheTwoWitnesses
2808 2018-04-12 19:12:53 Nope.  THC is processed from the oil directly
2809 2018-04-12 19:12:47 three times a year i think about that netflix show “love” and how the main character walks from those shitty apartments on barham to the united oil on sunset to buy groceries and it makes me SO mad
2810 2018-04-12 19:12:47 coconut oil in coffee >>>>>>
2811 2018-04-12 19:12:38  I love a good grill cheese as well but I use my grill will an olive oil spray. I don't use butter...
2812 2018-04-12 19:12:34 Canada's lack of a credible climate plan reflects badly on Canada.  As does its kowtowing to foreign oil companies.
2813 2018-04-12 19:12:28 Ooh me too, stir fried in sesame oil with garlic and ginger
2814 2018-04-12 19:12:20 .@bp_owl I think you're missing something. Diet is the key factor. Just tell ppl to eat a Whole Foods Plant Based Diet (& preferably no oil or salt added to foods), and bam, problem solved. Sleep's important too, and stress, but diet is probably more than all others combined IMO.
2815 2018-04-12 19:12:19 They are rushing to get the oil to market as we will see a downshift for demand in the future. Time to move to greener technologies. When things are rushed accidents happen. We (all Canadians) can’t afford a spill. Green jobs are growing. Oil jobs are temporary and will shrink.
2816 2018-04-12 19:12:10 They have sovereign money and you want them to be banked by the cartel.  Plus oil.
2817 2018-04-12 19:12:10 Well done @IcelandFoods on your palm oil announcement .. let’s hope everyone else follows soon
2818 2018-04-12 19:12:07 ！爆！
2819 2018-04-12 19:11:56 ok, so i have to get my oil changed today, and they always ask me a million questions that i don’t know the answer to and usually i call my dad and ask him but he’s literally in kenya right now so i am going it alone. will keep u updated, wish me luck :/
2820 2018-04-12 19:11:55 Castor oil is making my eyebrows grow super fast I love it 
2821 2018-04-12 19:11:52 I just bought a cool new shoes  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2822 2018-04-12 19:11:51 Hello citizens of the world! Fish oil smells nasty AF! Thanks for your attention.
2823 2018-04-12 19:11:43 Currently working on a research topic on Nigeria textile industry, and realized how fucked up this country is...

Oil truly ruined us
2824 2018-04-12 19:11:39 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
2825 2018-04-12 19:11:37 Ignoring the fact Russia hit them where it hurt with the oil trade they were transporting leaving them with nothing. Look for some credible boots on ground journos who's links can't be traced back to something dodgy, I choose @VanessaBeeley over the white helmets any day
2826 2018-04-12 19:11:36 Not getting my sarcastic joke? Check. :p
2827 2018-04-12 19:11:35 10 Roller Bottles Essential Oil CaseEssential Oil Storage#NewItems just added to the store!
2828 2018-04-12 19:11:35 If you knew what the true objectives was, you'd look at this with new eyes.
2 pipe lines that need to be built have to go through Syria and Assad has refused, this is hurting UK and EU.
Also Israel/US back claims on the Golan Heights with oil reserves valued at 2 trillion.
2829 2018-04-12 19:11:34 Thanks to a blend of Pracaxi oil and saffron flower extract, @DevaCurl’s #WashDayWonder provides tons of slip to cut detangling time in half! Plus natural sugar-based technology strengthens hair to resist breakage! #contest
2830 2018-04-12 19:11:17 These anti pipeline protestors are all funded and supported by the Rockefeller and Soros organizations, only because they like buying our oil at a 40% discount. Only an absolute mind dead moron would not support this pipeline.
2831 2018-04-12 19:11:15 By far the best beard oil and balm is @Krakenbeardco  I tried a lot of products and brands before Kraken, and I didn’t really like any of them. Kraken is all natural ingredients, fresh scents and there just so happens to be a new collaboration Arekkz Gaming oil 
2832 2018-04-12 19:11:07 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2833 2018-04-12 19:11:03 Thats great, Soya, Palm Oil and Coconut Oil are terribly damaging
2834 2018-04-12 19:11:01 It's called 'By My Beard.' And you can get the shampoo, conditioner and oil for like 7 pound which is like 16 dollars??? Lol
2835 2018-04-12 19:10:57 As I understand risks were studied and ascertained before approval of P/L.  Living in AB, what I see is a province stopping a benefit of jobs for BC &AB and stopping prosperity and growth in Canada.  Your harbours are infamous for drug imports but don’t allow oil in harbour!!
2836 2018-04-12 19:10:47 The oil is running out looks like you may be seeing league 2 again 
2837 2018-04-12 19:10:42 We don’t only work on classics and hot rods. This week has been filled with service and repair on multiple daily drivers. Transmission services, oil changes, air conditioning repairs and more.  Call us for all your automotive needs.
2838 2018-04-12 19:10:40 It's the Clinton swamp tree. Its been growing since Bill was governor of Arkansas. Its just that Bill let Hillary go rogue while bill was president.
2839 2018-04-12 19:10:35 @LivingNola_ what's up with the oil spill in the Mississippi? @NOLAnews @wwoz_neworleans
2840 2018-04-12 19:10:32 I look at ingredients and lots of stuff has palm oil..I put it back on the shelf and go without
2841 2018-04-12 19:10:31 Gold and oil prices always rise in times of economic uncertainty... maybe it's all just one big case of market manipulation and insider trading. They're all probably pals behind closed doors. Who knows for sure?
2842 2018-04-12 19:10:29 It was called Oil Change. I'm sure this easily can be a successful reboot of it though.
2843 2018-04-12 19:10:22 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
2844 2018-04-12 19:10:22 ふん…起きやがったのか、OIL=何進…　あと一歩遅かったらギャリック砲をお見舞いしてやろうと思ってたんだが…残念だぜ…！！
2845 2018-04-12 19:10:20 But most Norwegians are very happy to have the worlds biggest pension slush fund provided by an endless supply of oil they sell!
2846 2018-04-12 19:10:19 Y’all take a pic with vegetable oil on your skin and caption it “my skin is glowing.” Looking for people to ask you what your routine is.
2847 2018-04-12 19:10:18 me: needs to check all my gear for an sca event, pack it all up, do laundry, dishes, clean the bathrooms, do taxes, get oil changed, get a haircut, go to grocery store, etc...

also me: spends 15 minutes dling PUBG cosmetics for XCOM 2 to give one of my rangers a frying pan
2848 2018-04-12 19:10:12 my honey feeds me baby oil to make my insides slippery
2849 2018-04-12 19:10:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2850 2018-04-12 19:10:06 Seems its not spewing oil from the crankcases, Its no Harley
2851 2018-04-12 19:10:01 New blog post written. Responded to youtube comments. Oil changed. Nails done. Workout complete for the day. New projects in the pipeline. Life is good.
2852 2018-04-12 19:09:58 Hypocrisy and oil reserves.
2853 2018-04-12 19:09:48 Masa leave the girl alone ...why are Ghanaians hypocrites like this majority of the people in the country do exactly what she said ....she did not say them well that's  all
2854 2018-04-12 19:09:48 Nonsense. US/CIA overthrew a secular, democratic gov't in Iran cuz they wanted more than 16% of their own oil revenues, replaced it w/nasty dictator&helped him torture&repress his people. That's what brought the ayatollahs2power. We trained&financed Osama&fanatics2fightUSSR.
2855 2018-04-12 19:09:42 Zion Oil/Gas. Weird, huh?
2856 2018-04-12 19:09:40 People be using baby oil as tanning oil and i weep for them
2857 2018-04-12 19:09:39 Shaking hands with the person who you said career was over after opening day check 
2858 2018-04-12 19:09:28 U.S. Oil Debt Eases, Meaning Drillers Target Next Shale Play via @markets
2859 2018-04-12 19:09:28 Since when was "highly likely " enough to convict ? What happened to innocent until "proven" guilty?? Proven guilt by Mugabe but there's no oil or shale gas there ....
2860 2018-04-12 19:09:19 The LOGA chairman emeritus wants u to believe declining gas & oil prices had nothing to do with drilling activity in Louisiana the last 3 years.  With his hand on the Bible, I have no evidence of any well not being drilled in louisiana cause of pending litigation. #carnivalbarker
2861 2018-04-12 19:09:06 But surely retraining highly skilled oil & gas workers as baristas, tourism workers, and pot growers (and smokers) will do the trick? No?
2862 2018-04-12 19:09:02 oh nice thank you. Cause I see movies where they go from oiling themselves, to having sex, to licking it off...I wonder if that's really a good idea with baby oil. 
2863 2018-04-12 19:09:01 Similarly, why haven't they been protesting the 500 tankers that've been plying the Salish Sea to Washington State refineries for the past 60 yrs, (within spitting distance of Victoria btw)? What about the tankers that bring 700K bbls of oil per day to our east coast? Hypocrites.
2864 2018-04-12 19:08:57 Just an idea JT, cut off transfer payment and oil shipments to BC if Horgan wants to continue his anti Canada campaign. Watch thier entire economy come to a grinding halt.
2865 2018-04-12 19:08:53 fire meet oil. #RiversOfBlood. #TheNewRacismIsTheOldResurrected
2866 2018-04-12 19:08:48 Today I saw you can buy 100% mineral oil in hair shops and I cringeddd. Why would people even use it
2867 2018-04-12 19:08:34 You are correct, her past history of anti oil and gas protesting, especially against pipelines, her shutting dow coal fired power generating plants, her carbon tax.

She and her ministers have burnt a lot of credibility!
2868 2018-04-12 19:08:31 Sat in a steamy bathroom filled with olbas oil eating mini eggs - I must get better!! This i think is the way!! 
2869 2018-04-12 19:08:17 The world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data!
2870 2018-04-12 19:08:13 Then why was business so bad?  You had gas and oil and wind and hydro?   Gas and oil has been booming in Ohio for the last seven years.
2871 2018-04-12 19:08:11 People been looking for a runner that will sustain, $SSOF is it, .0024 EPS for 2017, projecting $20M in revenues for 2018, acquisition still pending, audot, uplisting, Oil rig sales, this has plenty to drive it for weeks/months till it gets to true value
2872 2018-04-12 19:08:09 Oil
2873 2018-04-12 19:08:07 "Thank you America" for 'freeing' the MIddle East, destroying their infrastructure and creating the vacuum that led to the rise of ISIS, which was all done for the good of the people. nothing to do with oil at all.  WW3 here we come.
2874 2018-04-12 19:07:59 more worried about spilling the massage oil all down me legs tbh 
2875 2018-04-12 19:07:40 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
2876 2018-04-12 19:07:39 @EnergyPhilFlynn for @FoxBusiness  - See Phil on The Fox Business Network at 3:00 pm to wrap up on Oil and Gold prices | #energy #trading #markets #futures #gold
2877 2018-04-12 19:07:30 Why then do we continue to do their... Oh. Oil. Again.
2878 2018-04-12 19:07:21 China is leading the way in renewable energy, and has managed to remove the giant panda from the endangered species list. New Zealand has halted all new offshore oil exploration. We in North America had best take a few moments for quiet humility amidst all of our blustering.
2879 2018-04-12 19:07:18 Nope not baby oil, mineral oil isn’t allowed on my skin
2880 2018-04-12 19:07:11 Then you shouldn't get paid... you've been selling snake oil to the American people for years - Debt Whisperer... what a joke. You can leave now.
2881 2018-04-12 19:07:09 It’ll be nice when those weasels run out of oil and money, and quit tellin us what we need to do...
2882 2018-04-12 19:07:08 Told the guy that did my oil change today that I was “ballin’ on a budget” and he gave me 50% off. I should do that more often
2883 2018-04-12 19:06:52 abbachio drinks oil to dye his insides black to be extra goth
2884 2018-04-12 19:06:39 Ok before I'm done y'all need to also hear about peak rock phosphate it's a lot worse than peak oil. The world will descend into starvation and chaos. It's chill tho. I'm done now
2885 2018-04-12 19:06:31 There will be blood so good but it is not "Oil"what a book!
2886 2018-04-12 19:06:30 There is an oil spill in a flowing body of water and a steady breeze and I can smell it with every breath.
2887 2018-04-12 19:06:27 I just got an oil change so y’all better not let me catch y’all on the street
2888 2018-04-12 19:06:24 The article you ref focuses on oilsands companies. Many many other companies produce conventional oil in AB and are owned by CDNs. The AB gov is a royalty owner and benefits from a higher received price and therefore so does the rest of Canada. Your argument is too selective.
2889 2018-04-12 19:06:22 J’ai pris à maman du tea tree oil sans demander elle me fait "Lucia tu as pris un peu de mon tea tree ?” Papa répond “C’est quoi le demontirui” ?? 
2890 2018-04-12 19:06:21 Amazing idea but if you love yourself (which you clearly do cuz you're glowing) then please use a natural oil! Baby oil is full of carcinogens 
2891 2018-04-12 19:06:11 The oil changes on mine is a whole 90 but once you get that big maintenance bill out the way when it comes it good as new
2892 2018-04-12 19:06:08 Sadly that's true and it shows how far behind the 3rd largest port in NA is behind in marine prevention and oil recovery. Compared to WA State. BC has no fleet of Escort Tugs nor Emergency Recovery Tow Vessels.
2893 2018-04-12 19:06:05 White people with corn rows smell like burnt canola oil
2894 2018-04-12 19:05:54 So there's an oil leak in the Mississippi River as French Quarter Festival weekend just started. Guess you won't be anywhere around the river...me.
2895 2018-04-12 19:05:52 Getting my oil changed for the first time since 2016 I’m the worst car owner ever
2896 2018-04-12 19:05:52 oil on my timeline; Let's keep up can dunk
2897 2018-04-12 19:05:47 Holy fuck, you're a liar!  I'm sure you're making a ton of money on that snake oil.
2898 2018-04-12 19:05:39 Scalp oil'd by my main thing I've been stressed out
2899 2018-04-12 19:05:33 Woke up at 7 on my day off to get my oil changed. Then picked up a Little Caesar's hot-n-ready pizza. This is the worst day ever.
2900 2018-04-12 19:05:18 Sitting on the bathroom floor with a bottle of eucalyptus essential oil and the shower running on the hottest temp in hopes of creating my own personal sauna and being able to breath again 
2901 2018-04-12 19:05:17 ka aliw yung mga nag bebenta ng castor oil sa fb na pag kamahal-mahal like hello 40php lang sa watsons yun hahahaha
2902 2018-04-12 19:05:16 No, but I know what goes down. LOL Too much oil
2903 2018-04-12 19:05:06 Now Playing: [ 13 - Beds are burning (12 Inches) - Midnight Oil ]
2904 2018-04-12 19:04:55 If it makes you feel any better, earlier this week I miscalculated how many shampoos it would take to remove a coconut oil treatment to disastrous and publicly displayed results.
2905 2018-04-12 19:04:53 How can this war be over when Raqqa, Idlib, Daara are not under Regime control?! How can be over when the oil is under US "protection" in the East?How can be over when the NE is under US and Kurds control?! ...or do you believe that the criminal Assad will not fight for t places?
2906 2018-04-12 19:04:52 Filled my tank, put a new bulb in my blinker and got an oil change  get a man who does that shit for you
2907 2018-04-12 19:04:49 Getting my oil changed and the guy saw my cast member sticker and he said “does this oil change come with a Disney ticket?” 
2908 2018-04-12 19:04:47 i just shaved and rubbed coconut oil all over my legs. looks like i invented being sexy huh
2909 2018-04-12 19:04:41 RT oilpriceupdates "Daily Closing Oil Price Update: 72.14 #oil #opec #oilprice #brent"
2910 2018-04-12 19:04:37 it's going to be so funny when you all realize you're wrong, and you bought the snake oil
2911 2018-04-12 19:04:35 Fundamentally oppose boycotts but the only way to send message and stop this is to crush these businesses economically.
2912 2018-04-12 19:04:34 vape oil. Please I must see
2913 2018-04-12 19:04:27 Obviously you can just get pure tea tree oil at a health store. The Body Shop and Organix both have acne-targeted tea tree oil products that I’ve had success with as well.
2914 2018-04-12 19:04:12 Haha! There’s oil out there though.....
2915 2018-04-12 19:03:58 no but i know people who have used it and liked it - i use straight up Vaseline or oil.
2916 2018-04-12 19:03:58 I keep procrastinating on my plan to rig a 10 gallon kentwood water jug with some sort of skimmer so I can go collect the free oil. Probably could sell it for bitcoin.
2917 2018-04-12 19:03:53 What #DrainTheSwamp really entails is going after big pharma, big oil, private prison lobby, Wall St., and the many tentacles of the military-industrial complex. Trump doesn’t have the insight or moxie, just bitches abt attorneys in his own stupid party and the NY fucking Times.
2918 2018-04-12 19:03:43 I hot towel for 15 minutes or shaving after a shower help to soften up the hairs and makes the skin less taught.

Use a few drops of shaving oil, which helps avoid razor burn, and either shaving cream or a shaving soap. Cream doesn't need a brush.
2919 2018-04-12 19:03:40 Since gas/oil is created from millions of year old decomposed animals... does that mean any vegan with a gas car arent really vegan?
2920 2018-04-12 19:03:20 Probably not dairy then. And I do not have any recommendations for that. As for spot treatments, Neutrogena has one that’s worked better for me than almost any other over-the-counter product. Say Yes to Tomatoes has a good one to. ALSO! Tea tree oil.
2921 2018-04-12 19:03:18 Imagine if people own property’s with oil on it and how much they would save and all.
2922 2018-04-12 19:03:16 more spilt oil in the gulf?
2923 2018-04-12 19:03:14 Each and everyone of those trains the Oil companies are taxed per barrel. Odd who owns the rail system?? Warren Buffet and you wonder why
2924 2018-04-12 19:03:12 Instead of Vitamin E oil (nothing but soybean oil), opt for Oat oil instead.
2925 2018-04-12 19:03:08 The highly volatile oil that were in those cheap tanks were from the US field that has been producing because of the fracking. The oil companies contract the rail line too transport! The rail company went bankrupt and all others avoid accountability be claiming they were unaware
2926 2018-04-12 19:03:04 Harper had a world wide recession to deal with and the price of oil dropped so borrowing was justified. Plus he is no longer PM. The Liberals could have choosen a perfectly qualified leader in Garneau or Freeland or Hall-Findlay but instead choose a narcisist
2927 2018-04-12 19:03:04 Went to get my oil changed... within 5 mins of them having my car they popped a tire. I’m not a happy camper 
2928 2018-04-12 19:03:02 always am curious what kind of oil SWers use for stuff like this.
2929 2018-04-12 19:02:59 On development, they are thin. Precious little within a season of contributing in a real way, if at all. On Pick, unless they win the lottery I’d shop the Pick. Whether you trade it is 100% about the return. I say that because any pick below Top 5 is 2/3 years away.
2930 2018-04-12 19:02:43 Using coconut oil in Jus hair and I love it but I know others won’t. I wish the scent wasn’t as strong
2931 2018-04-12 19:02:41 OIL DIFF: 5.3 -> 5.27
2932 2018-04-12 19:02:33 Tea tree oil is a beautiful thing
2933 2018-04-12 19:02:31 ...a job in the boom and bust oil industry. You should be honest and tell job seekers that these will only last until the next bust
2934 2018-04-12 19:02:27 Who makes money from switching over from Fossil Fuels to Renewable resources+nuclear? 

Like you'd just be changing the jobs from oil rigs to solar manufacturing/installation.
2935 2018-04-12 19:02:27 And he’s an oil owned climate change denier. He’s completely unfit for any office.
2936 2018-04-12 19:02:25 Thanks sunny <33!! I really love oil painting :')!!
2937 2018-04-12 19:02:19 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict #palmoilfree.
2938 2018-04-12 19:02:12 precisely just ask the low income residents of Flint users of watersheds polluted by oil spills, NA Rez water supplies ruined by oil & gas spills & mining today that SOB says "We'll take care of environment" 3 sentences earlier he said he's directing EPA to get rid of more regs
2939 2018-04-12 19:02:08 Why is the price of oil on the increase? /commentary/shares/Why-is-the-price-of-oil-on-the-increase
2940 2018-04-12 19:01:49  O yea boi u look like a oil spot on the carpet in ur Profile pick
2941 2018-04-12 19:01:42 Right, tonight I craved Romanian coarse salt dry roast peanuts and KA Black Grape pop for dinner. But sometimes it's over date fetta, yellowed butter, Bovril, Miso, pickled hot peppers, oil fried bread, anchovies. Also canned fish to drown them in lemon juice. Oh, and raw nettles
2942 2018-04-12 19:01:41 It seems that
 EU are much interested on oil delta area. I think the people of benue needed this more than others.

2947 2018-04-12 19:01:18 Skincare addicted friends I need ur help: I bought a toner from neutrogena Sunday night and have used it twice and it’s made my skin dry beyond belief. I’ve used rosehip oil, moisturizer, and night cream daily since to try to help it and it’s still dry AF. Help?????? Plz
2948 2018-04-12 19:01:09 "Peter has a plan to get us back into the #NHLPlayoffs," quotes #BobNicholson. #Wow. I'm so relieved that #Chiarelli has a plan. #Truedope has a plan for #KinderMorgan. #Nutley has a plan for #Pipelines & the #Oilsands. We're in good hands here in #Edmonton... #SMH #Oilers #Oil
2949 2018-04-12 19:01:08 @jojojoheeley Agree,except for the last part, the UK needs oil & Gas,this winter many would have frozen without Russian Gas.
2950 2018-04-12 19:00:57 He could've at least used an oil well for the EPA symbol.
2951 2018-04-12 19:00:36 If you expect politicians to be smart or logical, I've got some snake oil to sell you.
2952 2018-04-12 19:00:36 We need to socialize/nationalize this out of control Oil/gas industry. They do not serve our/the peopleinterests any longer.  The oil, gas, oceans, animals are our inheritance!  We need to change this industry before it destroys us!
2953 2018-04-12 19:00:36 @ThePawPostUk anyone out there know of any supplements for a senior dog whose joints are getting ever stiffer? We use Yumove advance, but I thought that fish oil might help? Cheers!

2955 2018-04-12 19:00:24 I really hope Alberta cuts off oil to B.C. for a while to show these hypocrites a dose of reality. I also want all oil, gas, & products manufactured using petroleum cut off from our precious leader PM @JustinTrudeau, real PM @GeraldButts and all of @liberalparty at the same time.

2960 2018-04-12 19:00:05 Porsche used an advanced casting technique at one point, which unfortunately resulted in a number of engine casting porosity problems. In effect, some Porsche engines contain pockets of air in the molten aluminum, which can result in oil and water both being mixed in the engine.

2963 2018-04-12 18:59:47 O Trump, son of the whore, o criminal you destroyed Syria and Iraq and stole our oil
2964 2018-04-12 18:59:43 As I tweeted about two years ago, remember this war was all about the natural gas pipeline that supplies the EU.  Gulf states and US vs Iran Russian and Syria.  Always about the oil.  #trump #Syrian #war
2965 2018-04-12 18:59:28 I am
2966 2018-04-12 18:59:28 Oh I know My dumbass was trying to be cute in Nassau 3 years ago & didn’t have lotion & used Coconut oil to “shine” & got a mean ass sunburn broke out in heat bumps & everything
2967 2018-04-12 18:59:28 1. You gotta have trimmed ends. If yours ends don’t cooperate then you can’t have a successful twist out because it’ll keep unraveling. 
2. The LOC method is great! (Leave-in condition, oil, cream). Keeps hair mosturized for the majority of the twist out.
2968 2018-04-12 18:59:26 Safety inspections are no longer required for registration. You should still have working lights, though. And you should be able to get lights, an oil change, emissions test and renewal all at once.
2969 2018-04-12 18:59:10 Hello,
I'm tackling all 7 races tomorrow, so I'll be burning the midnight oil.
However so far we have 1:45 Storm Home e/w 10/1 & 2.20 Style De Garde e/w 10/1
I'm amazed how skilful you are in picking winners midweek & on other major sports.
Well worth following @top_rated_tips

2972 2018-04-12 18:59:04 The older I get, the simpler it becomes: Jason Skin Care Vitamin E cream for moisturizer (sold on Amazon, in Target, etc.), witch hazel for toner, tea tree oil for breakouts
2973 2018-04-12 18:59:04 What does Assad have to gain from this?  It makes no sense.  Israel and the US have been trying to get control of that region for years.  There's fucking oil contracts already in place for those soon to be occupied regions.  Don't be such a fucking mindless tool.

2976 2018-04-12 18:58:41 @futureidentity suggests taking “data is the new oil” analogy to its logical conclusion - look at the ultimate fate of the oil industry. The data economy is not sustainable in its current form (or at all?) #BCSTrust
2977 2018-04-12 18:58:34 If it’s only words....why is the UK GOVT holding an emergency meeting ? Your after their oil - just admit it ! 
2978 2018-04-12 18:58:32 Where are the good people helping those poor people in Syria? Just because Syria doesn't have any oil, no nation seems to care
2979 2018-04-12 18:58:26 Not to brag but I have $37 in my venmo account like some Russian oil magnate
2980 2018-04-12 18:58:20 But Mr Díaz-Canel cannot avoid economic reform of some kind. The economy  is in terrible shape and getting worse. Venezuela, whose like-minded  regime has provided aid in the form of subsidised oil, is in economic  crisis and sending less of it.
2981 2018-04-12 18:58:00 Time for a late lunch. Be back later.
These midnight oil sessions are tiring. 

2982 2018-04-12 18:58:00 Folks pray for a cake and God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, butter, a pan, and an oven. Then they get frustrated and walk out of the kitchen. If you have the ingredients what you do with them is up to you.
2983 2018-04-12 18:57:54 I’m strictly RT’ing Bob’s comments here, Rob. Are you asking for my opinion?
2984 2018-04-12 18:57:45 Yea..but how much oil can a junior doctor steal?
2985 2018-04-12 18:57:45 The "proof" is that the French want the Syrian oil like they did in Libya
2986 2018-04-12 18:57:45 Yea, go for it punk. Your oil will last 3 months.
2987 2018-04-12 18:57:42 I was having a crappy day then the oil guy showed up and delivered $436 worth of oil so my day sucked worse.  Yours is much better. 
2988 2018-04-12 18:57:38 So it's ok if I dump crude oil at your home and then come to clean up after?
2989 2018-04-12 18:57:35 People out here making “beard oil” WTF
2990 2018-04-12 18:57:31 Nerf collects dirt and oil. How about oversized d20’s then?
2991 2018-04-12 18:57:19 Meatloaf and roasted chicken with gouda and bleu cheese topped with guacamole, fresh peppers, and olives, with oil and vinegar and chipotle sauce served open-face on pumpernickel.
2992 2018-04-12 18:57:16 #ACMPR Producers and Cannabis Indsutry folk. How many SKU’s do you expect to see in cannabis retail stores? Both flower and oil? Regardless of provincial models, what might an avg. be?
2993 2018-04-12 18:57:04 I’ll follow McDavid to whatever team he goes to. He needs out of this & I hope Oil fans don’t turn on him for it.
2994 2018-04-12 18:56:59 Why are you quoting Tony Robbins? He's a snake oil salesman in the same vein as MLM coaches?
2995 2018-04-12 18:56:58 You left out “lefties” from your quote this time so you should be putting in [ ] where you left it out to meet APA guidelines. We know the “lefties” will not govern your approach. Your “approach”=Oil above all else, lie, pro-life, no GSAs, no sex ed, no carbon tax, attack! #ableg

2997 2018-04-12 18:56:49 Trump wants to slash the budget for clean energy research by 72%. He’s implementing tariffs to make solar panels more expensive. He’s even shutting down national monuments to free up more space for drilling oil.
#ImpeachTrump
2998 2018-04-12 18:56:44 An oil spill is not a matter of if but when it will happen. Have you ever seen the inlet where they plan to increase the oil tanker traffic? The amount of houses, the port, the businesses and community? Too much risk in play. It's just plain stupid to take this risk.
2999 2018-04-12 18:56:39 Is it my memory failing-wasn’t the threat of Saudi Arabian oil wealth’s ability to arm that was used to convince US to give up tax dollars to defend poor helpless victims of the holocaust settled in Israel from a nation that was a bitter enemy?

3006 2018-04-12 18:55:29 We have a lot of economic interests in the Gulf oil/gas extraction, but as a security issue if affects mainland Europe directly and us indirectly (our gas prices will rise if theirs does, the gas markets are linked even if we buy from Norway)

3010 2018-04-12 18:55:01 Kill this pipeline. It's an insane irresponsibility to increase tanker traffic and oil output into such a prestine and closed inlet as is the Burrard Inlet. Huge population in the area and beautiful marine life. Oil spill is not a matter of if but a matter of when.

3017 2018-04-12 18:54:08 It doesn't really matter. We do it better than most other areas in the world. If we don't someone else will. Just like our oil. The issue is we have the yankie $ stirring the pot to improve their buying power. We need to identify who get their $ here and expose the frauds

3022 2018-04-12 18:53:32 Russia, Syria, Libya, Iran, is the Quattro Axis, Russia with the idea of world dominance capitalizing on the oil in the Middle East. The Russian interference into the US affairs is that of the possibility of a civil war in the US and our ultimate down fall!
3023 2018-04-12 18:53:14 That's hypocritical when, of all the countries in the world where people are suffering including Yemen and Zimbabwe, the only one you want to illegally attack is one that has oil to steal (Iraq, Libya,. . ). How dare you call anyone a moron! (Rudeness shows you know you're wrong)
3024 2018-04-12 18:53:08 mm interesting! Those are good indeed!
Olive oil is also delicious with that type of bread!
(or rubbed tomatoes mmm pan tumaca)
3025 2018-04-12 18:53:05 My suggestion is to house them in some of the disused oil platforms out in North Sea.
No phone signal..Unlikely to escape..No visits ...the positives go on and on...
3026 2018-04-12 18:53:02 Thats probably because as you said noone wants to sell them. Dont the companies like get millions of dollars from oil companies? I heard somewhere ford was did so (but thats probably just a rumour)

3028 2018-04-12 18:52:47 Well, a week is a long time to get things going somehow. Dance A LOT. Eat a vindaloo, drink castor oil, go for the longest walk you can manage and then have a hot bath. Then do what you did that made him and if that doesn't work, light a fire and smoke him out 
3029 2018-04-12 18:52:37 @ROLAIRsystems We sent you garbage compressor back. Your customer service refused to send a 2nd tech out to fix your junky oil spitting compressor. Now your customer service is lying and sayin you did send a 2nd tech. Lying isn’t a good customer service policy.
3030 2018-04-12 18:52:23 Still doesn't identify who did it. 
Who gains the most? Islamists. They strap own children with bombs. Just sayin.

3032 2018-04-12 18:52:15 My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn,

pulling artlessly with fool commands.
Some nights
I just never go to sleep at all,

3034 2018-04-12 18:52:07 Hahaha same like I’ll cook with coconut oil or use it on my skin/hair but never again in my drinks
3035 2018-04-12 18:51:48 Like Bush did after 9/11. ? I don't think it was ever for the reasons he stated. twas for the oil imho.

3042 2018-04-12 18:51:18 Another name, well done. .. where are your facts?  None presented so far.  Just a demonstration of dislike for US.  Fact - Chávez expropriated farm land and oil resources & kicked out competent operators.  Now country can’t even feed itself.

With or without a permit, oil companies were required to restore the environment & they failed to do so for many decades. There is no legal "escape clause."

3076 2018-04-12 18:48:52 My coworker always try to talk to me about some about the importance of religion so I always try to switch up the conversation and every time he starts talking I say "yes I did put coconut oil in my hair today thank you so much for noticing"
3077 2018-04-12 18:48:49 Loved it, thank you for all the info and i will be looking for this oil!
3078 2018-04-12 18:48:48 A good tool helps us to engage with each other and the world around us. If it doesn’t then it’s a gimmick or snake oil.
3079 2018-04-12 18:48:44 WM has over 50 years near bankrupted an oil rich country ,scotland  plays a huge part in contributing its resource wealth to Westminster yet we have no say and our votes are ignored,if that's not treating your union partner like a colony I don't know what is
3080 2018-04-12 18:48:43 Is that someone under the car? Is he changing his oil afterwards?
3081 2018-04-12 18:48:37 in 1 night,I coughed up n only what I can  describe as brown gunky oil. My lungs r twitching I have burning pain get fevers? The pain is constant  I went A&E n got fobbed off for the 3rd time 12 days of amoxiclav all bloods clear blood clot clear x-ray clear HELP!
3082 2018-04-12 18:48:36 The design has been used on oil platforms for some time.
The floater is not on the surface, it is pulled down under water. No vertical movement at all.
3083 2018-04-12 18:48:33 A very bad move. For more proxy wars like SYRIA I assume.  Libya and Iraq not having been enough? Mind you all those barrels of oil and all that SHALE GAS won't extract itself from beneath SYRIA. Oh, what a lovely PROXY war. History will record.
3084 2018-04-12 18:48:30 Wow...you must really hate oil companies for doing business in those horrible countries and for importing that oil to Canada because it is more profitable.

The ethical breakdown is not with Canadians it is your friends in the industry.
3085 2018-04-12 18:48:26 People are quite mean.  With all the #kidney and #liver failures we have. There is also one awful #groundnut oil on sale now. May God help his children.

3087 2018-04-12 18:48:09 You would think the “chosen people” would be more tolerant after what happened throughout history but most recently at hands of Nazi Germans. Like  oil & water, religion & politics don’t mix. Sad situation. #WestBank #Palestine #Hypocrites
3088 2018-04-12 18:48:05 The weather's slightly warmer and the days are getting longer, but you're still using oil for heat and hot water... make sure you keep an eye on that tank level! #oppurecares

3092 2018-04-12 18:47:47 When I’d get my oil changed, the place always forgot to rest my oil warning light. 

It took the blood of a virgin sacrifice, a Skeleton key and juggling different bits in the car..but I managed to reset it. 
3093 2018-04-12 18:47:42 My go-to joke whenever I am in New York and someone says gas prices are so much lower in Louisiana is to say "Yep, it's because you can go to all our major waterways and scoop the oil right out for free."

3100 2018-04-12 18:47:16 Change your panties troll. Mother(less Russia) produces nothing that other countries want to buy. Other than oil which just happens to be there, they produce zero products.

3110 2018-04-12 18:45:59 This ain't interstate right of ways being fought over. Albeit there's  more to Syria than oil (Israeli interests=major), but... Maybe look at why the US and Britain staged the coup in Iran to control their oil.  Fact.  (The original reason they refer to us as the Great Satan.)
3111 2018-04-12 18:45:56 Yeah this is kind of a problem, I agree. But even oil guys should be worried about climate change. Long-term thinking is smart thinking.

3115 2018-04-12 18:45:29 here’s a rehashed idea. let’s build more refineries so we can keep ‘our’ oil for ourselves instead of shipping raw product and the associated jobs overseas. most BC’ers would be on board with getting access to fuel w/o risking coastal waters

3133 2018-04-12 18:44:19 @realDonaldTrump Sr what’s going on with our oil? Gas prices are going way up. We finally got tax cuts but now we have to put it towards gas to get to work. Sucks

3159 2018-04-12 18:41:35 Russia is betting on an oil dominated future! When your biz model is gas station or arms sales few choices exist! Solar utility generation now on par with coal quicker to deploy & microgrid capable deployments are very viable! BUILD A SOLAR WALL!

3182 2018-04-12 18:40:03 Families and communities whose well-being is or has been dependent on coal/oil/gas have an even harder road than most in dealing w the collective guilt of past emissions and the anxiety of current emissions.

3184 2018-04-12 18:39:57 It seems ever since we allowed exports of oil & gas our gas and oil prices have increased. What truly is happening.
3185 2018-04-12 18:39:48 Re: US putting out most oil ever,why the hell are gas prices here on the rise? Hurts us on a fixed income that don't benefit from jobs & job bonus. What about us?

Let me ask it another way.  Maybe you wont dodge it this time.

Would you believe a group of scientists employed by an oil company who tell you not to worry about AGW?
3190 2018-04-12 18:39:19 Probably because electricity companies are even more greedy than oil companies and charge exorbitant tariffs on solar

3197 2018-04-12 18:38:21 So charged regardless. I think I've figured it out which is that olive oil and balsamic vinegar are for seasoning food, bread is for after the main for soaking up sauce, and the plate they gave us was a test to see if we'd dip our bread in olive oil like heathen Americans.
3198 2018-04-12 18:37:59 I look at it this way if it's burning it you don't have to have your oil changed all the time.
3199 2018-04-12 18:37:36 For in-depth see @morphonios Youtube channel. The Western Controllers want Syrian oil & a pipeline. Assad is allied w/Iran & Russia who are resisting the New World Order for their own national interests. The NWO is using their proxies (Deep State) for a War in Syria

3204 2018-04-12 18:37:08 Haha, nope. Bread is included in the cover fee that's part of every bill for a sit down meal here. It's usually like €2 and covers bread, place settings, and olive oil.
3205 2018-04-12 18:37:04 I don’t feel like it sounds logical either! Like yeah I wanna lose weight so I’m gonna smother everything in oil and cheese... like wut
3206 2018-04-12 18:36:59 Burn the midnight oil. #IndiaforAsifa Enough is enough. India needs to get back to its roots. No more divisive politics. India is for all.

3212 2018-04-12 18:36:19 They are interested in looking for oil in the north.. Wasting the nation resources
3213 2018-04-12 18:36:14 Europe is motivated by oil/gas. Putin has them by the short and curlies. Iran is a threat to regional peace (see Hezbollah in Lebanon/Syria, Houthis in Yemen and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq) and Iran absolutely wants a war to destroy Israel.
3214 2018-04-12 18:36:01 Dead whales with stomachs full of plastic, oil spills destroying nature, fracking polluting everything, palm oil devastating the rain forests! When are humans going to realize we are killing ourselves and this planet? I know, when its to late!
3215 2018-04-12 18:35:44 Moot point my man, 55% of NG households are already heated by firewood. A large portion more interested in converting to electirc heat than oil or firewood.
3216 2018-04-12 18:35:42 The same hard working Americans who destroyed the Middle East, plundered all of the gold and oil and killed millions of innocent men women and children. You make me sick to be a human.

3224 2018-04-12 18:35:03 Blue, or German, chamomile is widely known for its calming properties. Blue Chamomile essential oil has a high content of azulene, the active organic compound of chamomile, which bears a blue color. #Herbchat

3232 2018-04-12 18:34:25 Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Similar huge oil reserves in Libya & Afghanistan. Oil is power, big power. In Biafra a million died for UK Oil interests, Unfortunately Syria has become a pawn in this same dirty game.

3241 2018-04-12 18:33:26 We need to end ethanol! Let the farmers return to feeding the world and let our refineries go back to oil refining! That's the "win-win" approach. But you won't because of that filthy lucre from lobbyists.....smdh!

3246 2018-04-12 18:33:10 The Canadian economy is doing good enough, it looks likes rates are going to rise, oil has picked up to a three year high, many of our banks have significant foreign exposure, yet the bank stocks are truly lagging.
3247 2018-04-12 18:32:48 This country is not motivated by oil/gas on this issue, you're simply wrong. This country should not bring about regime change in Iran. Israel is not a threat.
3248 2018-04-12 18:32:39 .@JustinTrudeau
The cost of refining bitumen is higher than oil prices. Oil companies are in business to make money, not lose it. The $60B Canadian investors paid for the stranded bitumen assets of foreign fossil fuel companies is gone. Let’s stop throwing good money after bad.
3249 2018-04-12 18:32:34 To be quickly! Turkey violates the airspace above Greek islands and Greek seas multiple times a month. Last year more then 120 Times. And on Cyprus they want the oil and gas which is on the Greek side of the seas in Cyprus!

3270 2018-04-12 18:30:48 Brent crude oil high, so?  How should that be a political point?

3271 2018-04-12 18:30:47 To address the problem, reclassify marijuana and recognize that CBD oil is different from THC as the mind altering chemical is generally removed but it assists with pain, inflammation, treatment, therapy and open research to other fields.

1)Take an old pot 
2) add water to the pot and allow it to boil on the stove for 5mins ( well until you see bubbles ) 
3) add Conditioner and coconut oil to the water ( add a generous amount )
4.) Place weave or wig in pot and start to cook it

3346 2018-04-12 18:24:16 That's a lot of nothing you just wrote.
He doesn't support #MedicareForAll.
He supports oil and gas pipeline jobs.
He refuses to debate his primary challenger.
He dances between raindrops ("efforts to increase the minimum wage? Really?)
3347 2018-04-12 18:24:16 this man @ jiffy lube hooked me up w/ a free oil change 
3348 2018-04-12 18:24:05 World’s largest Oil refinery will come in Ratnagiri and will massively destroy mango farms and ecology.

3354 2018-04-12 18:23:29 My god if Notley& feds can afford to finance KM pipeline for. $ 7.4 B They can build a refinery in the friggin tar sands & supply Canadians cheaper oil at 1/4 of that
3355 2018-04-12 18:23:13 Hi Tony,

thanks for your interest and concern. We’re passionate about pledging palm oil free on our own label products, but this is just the start. We’re also speaking to all of our branded suppliers too and encouraging them to make the change too!  

Thanks for your interest!
3356 2018-04-12 18:23:12 Coconut oil!
3357 2018-04-12 18:23:01 It’s an absolute abomination that Canadians don’t have any ownership of our resources in a provincial or national oil company. One of only a few in the world, US being the other. Why any Cdn would crave to be exploited by uncaring foreign owned corporations is beyond me.
3358 2018-04-12 18:22:59 the dude at jiffy lube gave me $15 off my oil change cause he remembers me from friday the 13th last year he was like “your tattoos caught my eye, couldnt forget” 
3359 2018-04-12 18:22:53 Clean energy is the new boom to economies, that the oil companies are trying to destroy, to keep selling their dirty oil! Like cavemen trying to stop people from living in houses, than living in a cave! Backwards thinking will not bring us a better future!

3362 2018-04-12 18:22:46 Lafayette's unemployment rate is 4.1%, one of the lowest in the state & the same exact rate as the national average. Last year, 200 oil & gas workers were laid off in Lafayette. Hardly "tops in the nation" & nothing to do with "lawsuits."

Houma, by the way, added 500 new jobs.

3375 2018-04-12 18:21:08 I dunno, but I tried voting for a Government that’ll invest in public transport, trains, and cycleways, and wind down oil and gas exploration.

3384 2018-04-12 18:20:15 I'm not an expert, I just see a province that is struggling. Exporting oil and gas is our economy. There are so many families that rely on it.
3385 2018-04-12 18:20:11 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This April, read labels carefully.
3386 2018-04-12 18:19:57 What exactly is character education? any proven efficacy or just another pseudoscience myth like VAK , MI and accelerated learning? Headteacher or snake oil seller? Rubbish. avoid.
3387 2018-04-12 18:19:54 Let's just go without gas and heat then I suppose? Is that your plan? Or maybe keep supporting Saudi Arabia by purchasing their oil (and traffick it over our precious oceans) a place that mutilates baby girls and kills gays. Good plan, u have really thought this one through.

3396 2018-04-12 18:18:49 Global oil demand is forecasted to grow 1.5% this year and if you look at year over year demand, there is no indication that this is slowing. Also, Canada is a large investor in alternative energy sources and a world leader in climate policy. Our resource sector is word class.
3397 2018-04-12 18:18:43 Why is USA so greedy, they have already grabbed most of the Arab oil and now threatening Syria, go and attack Russia if you have power, saying be ready to Russia to attack Syria!
3398 2018-04-12 18:18:38 If he was a war monger, #Hamas would be dead.  Don't need #Syrian land.  And we have enough oil.  So what are you talking about.

3402 2018-04-12 18:18:19 Rising global crude oil prices and domestic health cost prices are contributing to India's inflation while prices of services, such as internet data prices, have fallen.
3403 2018-04-12 18:18:18 Oil paint is so cool omg
3404 2018-04-12 18:18:13 See how they do it! Just “adding some capacity to an oil pipeline”. Not “committing this country to tripling dilbit exports for decades and scuttling any ability to meet our international commitments to reduce GHG’s” in the face of passionate constitutional objections.
3405 2018-04-12 18:18:09 But... but...  the Post does such a great job of _promoting_ Big Oil over all other, umm... journalistic concerns — shouldn’t the Trudeau gov’t, phony environmentalists if ever there were such a thing, be willing to $hare the love a bit in return??
3406 2018-04-12 18:18:08 I’ll be damned if I’m putting my 50 dollar highlighter in some baby oil... SHIDDDDDDD. Take my ass to cvs or sumn
3407 2018-04-12 18:18:05 He said 10,000 barrels of oil flowing a day but under Obama our gas price was 2.25 thru 2.50 and sometimes cheaper! Now I understand that prices need to be somewhere around $2.50 a gallon for a profit but $2.80 and on to $3.00 starts to hurt us lower class folks

3412 2018-04-12 18:17:45 What’s the over under on how long between her last day in office and her first day on the job as an overpaid oil and gas industry lobbyist? If it’s 5 days, I’ll take the under.
3413 2018-04-12 18:17:43 Much more simple than that. Saudi Arabia buys weapons from us and sells us oil. Syria doesn't. That's why they get bombed.
3414 2018-04-12 18:17:42 No more rellos. Edibles, oil, pens. Prob will help a lot.
3415 2018-04-12 18:17:34 Will you be selling other branded mince pies with palm oil in?
3416 2018-04-12 18:17:33 In 2003 the main slogan of the peace movement was 'No War for Oil', a distracting focus on a secondary issue.

This time, we need a clear message that hits home hard and gives the key perpetrators pause: MORE WARS FOR ISRAEL

3418 2018-04-12 18:17:24 Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Reports have recently emerged regarding the Seychelles meetings (now plural!) with Erik Prince - Rick Gates is testifying to this & Manafort's involvement w/ RUS
3419 2018-04-12 18:17:23 Really, I work and can be drug tested at any time. We have to pass one just to get a job in the oil/gas field. So, what is the issue?
3420 2018-04-12 18:17:21 Looking good Oil Caps!
3421 2018-04-12 18:17:13 Immersion liquid or engineered liquid. I don't think its mineral oil.
3422 2018-04-12 18:17:09 Nobody thinks it's weird for a lady to know a lot about oil. But before you get to a place where women + economics is "normal", most young women (including me), needed a push from a parent, teacher or mentor telling them they WERE smart enough to be in the room (and stay there.)
3423 2018-04-12 18:17:02 me: so what does this "poop" essential oil do?
essential oil saleswoman: if you buy it, essentially, you're an asshole
3424 2018-04-12 18:16:59 Y’all I’m getting my hair pressed and trimmed, oil treatment, hydration... everything today and I cannot wait!!!!!! It’s been a long timing coming.

3430 2018-04-12 18:16:23 Many insiders, including Q, Bill Cooper, & the original FBI Anon, have confirmed this. Also, it makes no sense to NOT have a cure with all the fancy quantum computers & data processors we have now. Finally, people found 3 cures: cannabis Oil, Vit B17, & Rerum. Doctors are silent.

3435 2018-04-12 18:15:50 I'm hanging out at the dealership right now as I wait for an oil change and I'm listening to the employees film a campy local commercial
3436 2018-04-12 18:15:46 hahahaha.

I dip my head into a bucket of Co-op own brand diet lemonade and vegetable oil
3437 2018-04-12 18:15:44 Crazy 
3438 2018-04-12 18:15:28 It always made me laugh when people would think that mechanics should have rough hands. "We have them in oil a lot of the time" would be my answer.
I used to rebuild Allison auto trannies and had a 5lb tin of vaseline to lube all the seals and o-rings. I had very soft hands...
3439 2018-04-12 18:15:26 Poor reporting of awful #ProxyWar in #Syria obscures the real issues

2. Israel vs Iran (Hizbollah)
3. Saudi vs Iran (Saudi/US/Israel fund AlQaeda&ISIS)
4. US vs Russia
5. Turkey,Iraq,Syria vs Kurds
There is NO Military solution to this
#Notinmyname #C4News
3440 2018-04-12 18:15:24 You need to start them up and drive them a bit or the tires might get out-of-round. And the oil needs to circulate regularly, too.
3441 2018-04-12 18:15:23 We are not the world police seeing we can even control our own problems. We waste so much money in the Middle East and get very little in return. If it’s oil then push hard to rid the us of oil dependency. Then come up with a alt fuel to replace gas.
3442 2018-04-12 18:15:16 Collapse is a big word and implies a fat tail event. Probably not going to happen, however yuan oil futures are a big deal no matter how you look at it.
3443 2018-04-12 18:15:14 Agree, however do commodities still create value? (Don't think on oil solely) If so, is this showing us intangible global value chains?

3448 2018-04-12 18:14:36 The reason why the United States wants to topple Syria it is for a pipeline that goes from Qatar through Iraq through Syria into the Mediterranean to supply oil and natural gas to Europe
3449 2018-04-12 18:14:31 Dead well she need oil up the lyrics while she at it
3450 2018-04-12 18:14:24 Mines a liquid so it gets squirted in my mouth as I won’t tolerate stuff on my food. They tried fish oil once I refused to eat for a week. They are still trying to get kibble down me but having to give me other things too which sometimes work. Star loves the kidney food 
3451 2018-04-12 18:14:15 Yea but that oil is the very best, and very freshest.
3452 2018-04-12 18:14:15 Worth noting about half the oil pricing team in London at @PlattsOil is women, with collective background in economics, journalism, IR, political economy, finance, geology and commodities trading. And it's amazing the difference spending your days around these women makes.
3453 2018-04-12 18:14:05 No, the oil bussiness is down and the money doesn't go tho the Venezuelan people who are earning $0.78 a month and diying of hunger. The expropiations, destruction on national production and corruption is what ruined Venezuela in the first place. Venezuelans need to be recued.
3454 2018-04-12 18:14:02 @EPAScottPruitt is dumping oil into the swamp. @TeamTrump has made the swamp worse.  At least it seems to be @GOP members who are running scared and resigning in disgrace and/or disgust of you and Trumpism.
3455 2018-04-12 18:13:52 He also failed to disclose business dealings with a China gov't connected oil company. The man is a liar and a traitor.
3456 2018-04-12 18:13:46 Baby oil. Try it and thank me later
3457 2018-04-12 18:13:25 you keep ignoring the obvious: we don't need to crap all over our back (& front) yard to acquire oil when there are far cleaner & more efficient forms of extraction. we don't need to create massive tailings lakes to enrich a texas oil giant and its stakeholders. we have options
3458 2018-04-12 18:13:21 she recalls a glans to be your slicked horn softer than its bowl butterfingered before his shrinking oil
3459 2018-04-12 18:13:18 The question to counter that is: is there any oil in Indonesia? If not, it's, unfortunately, a case of life goes on as normal, for them.
3460 2018-04-12 18:13:04 Are these the “paid” convention shills touting the Snake Oil and its benefactor?
3461 2018-04-12 18:13:02 $OIH names have been down for a long time and not participated in oil rally over last 9 months. Also many  in E&P upstream sector still down huge.  Either these names come up or oil rally fails.

3467 2018-04-12 18:12:09 Not to beat a dead horse but... Trump is making a mistake not jumping on the worldwide renewable energy bandwagon. His hope is to keep oil jobs etc and that's fine but the future isn't in fossil fuels. It's not an either or situation. We can be leaders in renewable energy but...
3468 2018-04-12 18:12:08 If more than a few days, might need to buy beard oil and live with the label of hipster.
3469 2018-04-12 18:12:02 Udhav Thakeray is gone mad. Opposing an oil refinery in Konkan area is ridiculous. It is not an atomic plant. What is the logic in opposing? His party has developed hatredness towards BJP. Today's municipal council results in favour of BJP is the reason.
3470 2018-04-12 18:11:59 Good. Its nothing but an unaccountable extortion racket
3471 2018-04-12 18:11:54 Some @NigelSlater inspired easy to make comfort food: chop  an onion, some sweet potatoes, some chillis (to taste) & some chorizo all into rough chunks, put in an oven tin, shove some olive oil ,salt & pepper over them & shove in oven at 200C for 25 mins. Poach a couple of eggs
3472 2018-04-12 18:11:50 Bet... Lemme go look... but buddy had a fake ass oil company where him and Slim were the CEO and it was a copy and paste of a real oil company with no real links
3473 2018-04-12 18:11:46 Tucker, you & I both know this is a dog & pony show a false flag to take out Assad just like they did in Iraq & Libya...THEY WANT THE OIL & a Taxpayer, American Soldier Led War & They Will Kill or whatever It Takes to GET IT...

3477 2018-04-12 18:11:26 many of us know there is an agenda by the banker,the oil men,big corp,The Vatican,want one world government,This plan is to control all of the east/west.There goal is to take Syria,
Russia and Syria Won't work Rothschild or there money  stealing system,Rothschikd killed millions
3478 2018-04-12 18:11:25 Don't be silly.  There's not enough oil in Yemen for the US to care about those children.
3479 2018-04-12 18:11:24 That’s rich coming from a province that receives the vast majority of its oil from non-Canadian sources. Yet, you’re more than willing to accept transfer payments from the rest of the country. Take with one hand and slap us in the face with the other. #BuildKM
3480 2018-04-12 18:11:19 $PRKA seems too cheap. The company's Georgia park has very good reputation among visitors, growing revenue after introducing online sales, operating leverage. No doubt attendance has been helped by low oil prices, but I think online sales + reputation are also responsible
3481 2018-04-12 18:11:16 And guess who wants it..oh yes..it’s ..ALL..about the Oil...
3482 2018-04-12 18:11:15 I learned war threatens our environment and animals in the environments as well. In a text I read it says “Oil can be leaked or burned off, as in the Gulf War, but primarily it is put to use in all kinds of machines polluting the earth’s atmosphere, placing us all at risk”
3483 2018-04-12 18:11:11 Syria Strike- when it happens, watch for signs of escalation with Russia (Ukraine or Baltics) and Iran (Yemen or Saudi Arabia). In the absense of new hostilities, oil and gold will settle down... stock market will rise. But if new hostilities develop, markets could get ugly.
3484 2018-04-12 18:11:05 Yes. Yes it is
3485 2018-04-12 18:10:44 President Trump just stated that the USA is exporting 10 Million Plus  barrels of oil?  So why are gas prices still going up?!?!?
3486 2018-04-12 18:10:41 hollup. what imaginary oil company? did I not do my Googles correctly?! get me hip love!
3487 2018-04-12 18:10:36 Golan Heights oil - more under there than in SAUDI.  Start there.  Also Google - SHALE GAS FOUND SYRIA.  We good now? Well, least you can't say you weren't told the truth on what SYRIA is really about.

3497 2018-04-12 18:10:09 Could Alberta turn off the taps to BC?  
Dwight Newman, constitutional law expert at UofS says: "Because Alberta owns the oil and gas produced there, it could decide not to sell oil to B.C. any longer".
Full disclosure, Dwight taught me Constitutional law #bcpoli #abpoli #TMX

3499 2018-04-12 18:10:05 Yes! My federal action has attached to it medical records from a vet who was addicted to Oxy. We put him on the Holy oil and Extreme oil and it broke his addiction immediately. He was no longer in pain and had no desire to take oxy. He is now off of all major medications.
3500 2018-04-12 18:10:05 go short on crude oil...
3501 2018-04-12 18:10:04 Literally have spent over an hour waiting on an oil change  I could be doing better things on my day off than this. I could change my oil faster than this nonsense.
3502 2018-04-12 18:10:02 Oil needs to benefit Canadians not big oil. If Alberta want's to keep producing oil then they can refine it and sell it to Canadians who are affected at the pumps for years, not shipping shit bitumen to China.
3503 2018-04-12 18:09:59 Ok, cool. I'll look forward to it. I'm sure there's a con, like a scent clash with the scent of the oil.
3504 2018-04-12 18:09:53  Screw coal, oil humans have free energy. Must be released by the Dark to liberate all of us! On the other hand: It's raining trolls here now, so I will take a hike and support Gaia! Love and Light friends and trolls! Have a Great day!
3505 2018-04-12 18:09:46 #JIO #OIL
3506 2018-04-12 18:09:45 A couple of Tories want to play war for oil so hundreds of Londoners can get blown to bits, thousands of Syrians can die, millions of pounds can be pissed away while dozens of British poor starve to death and billions of years can be wiped off the life of the Earth.  Sounds fair.
3507 2018-04-12 18:09:37 @larry_kudlow When the President ends the oil industry subsides both sides of the isle will cheer--then moan when they realize @realDonaldTrump beat them to the punch for 2018 election

3512 2018-04-12 18:09:22 President Trump at the Rose Garden. While we're exporting all of that oil, gas prices at the pump continue to rise. Again, 1% winning at our expense @GOP
3513 2018-04-12 18:09:16 You can just use argan oil and bypass all the silly names.

3518 2018-04-12 18:08:49 #POTUS just confirmed that the #USA is exporting 10 million barrels of oil per day via tide water. We're selling the #USA 93% of our exported oil at bargain basement prices. Why?  Because we can't get OUR oil to tide water. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!
3519 2018-04-12 18:08:35 Despite massive US shale output, failure to meet targets among #OPEC states sees oil prices continue to surge. @i24NEWS_EN

3521 2018-04-12 18:08:25 "Taking care of our environment"

He's taking care of it by enabling polluters to wreck it and for mining and oil companies to go into formerly protected areas like Bears Ears to profit while Native Americans get screwed again.

It's the same snake oil, cult bullshit that the GOP sells to their base.

3544 2018-04-12 18:05:43 Oil Prices Hit Three-Year High on Geopolitical Risk: 

Oil surged to the highest levels in more than three years as tensions simmered in the Middle East, signaling optimism that a glut that has crippled the market for years is ending.
3545 2018-04-12 18:05:31 Trump is now saying that USA is now  EXPORTING oil to the tune of 10 million barrels per day!

3551 2018-04-12 18:04:41 Thank you Liberals for carbon taxes, failed pipelines & all the Saudi & US oil we are forced to buy at exorbitant prices. This is what happens when Trudeau & Butts bow down to George Soros and the Alt-Left!
Feel like your back yet Canada? 

3552 2018-04-12 18:04:37 The issue is the lack of pipeline access to tidewater which is costing the  economy $10 billion a year. 

That benefit now goes to  because 97% of our oil exports go to .

Fuck you, traitor.
3606 2018-04-12 18:00:24 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3607 2018-04-12 18:00:23 I put money into text books in 2014 and I would like to put 2 trillion into text books for schools this year and another 10 trillion into oil and pay off the oil debt if you can find it.. Sincerely god speaking through Carrie Kelly. @HouseFloor

3612 2018-04-12 18:00:07 i’m sparkling y’all. I really underestimated the shimmer oil I made.
3613 2018-04-12 18:00:06 1. Diminish ties and strength of relationship between Syria, Russia, and IRAN.(and their State sponsored proxies and terrorist groups)

2. Allow our allies that helped killed​ ISIS land and oil rights.

3. Number 2 includes land and possible State-Hood for Kurds.
3614 2018-04-12 18:00:01 Bacchus had of her mouth right no mast'ry.
For wine and slothe do Venus increase,
As men in fire will casten oil and grease.
3615 2018-04-12 17:59:52 More propaganda for the masses. Corporate oil has a firm grip on this government. Now go drink your oil, it’s good for you.
3616 2018-04-12 17:59:48 This could become a full blown constitution crisis is this what you really want?  The federal government represents the best interests of all Canadians. Please explain the difference between a pipeline and a million rail cars carrying oil?
3617 2018-04-12 17:59:36 News media "polls" are biased. At latest rallies pro oil supporters under 200, anti pipe protesters 10,000. News reported on the former.  What a joke.
3618 2018-04-12 17:59:35 the dirtiest & least efficient form of oil extraction is NOT a means to a clean energy future, it is the opposite
3619 2018-04-12 17:59:23 Bouta go get baby girl’s baby girl a oil change.
3620 2018-04-12 17:59:21 Just waiting for the day we have an intelligent conversation about energy and the oil and gas industry. These articles only fuel misinformation and divide Canadians.
3621 2018-04-12 17:59:14 KANSAS TAXING FAMILY FARM & OIL INTO OBLIVION.
3622 2018-04-12 17:59:06 Just take a deep breath.
3623 2018-04-12 17:59:02 Just in:-Crude Oil Hits $72 per barrel.
3624 2018-04-12 17:58:53 Ver sad, but no proof of chemical weapons. The root cause is Shia Sunni hate, till that is fixed nothing will change in Syria. Syria is secular. Iran has to stop its Israel hate. USA, oil lobby and Israel along with Saudi should stop support to Anti-Assad Sunni Wahabi groups.
3625 2018-04-12 17:58:51 I use almond oil mixed with Shea butter. Heavenly.
3626 2018-04-12 17:58:49 That oil change before Coachella lmao been there done that
3627 2018-04-12 17:58:48 He is filling the swamp with his snake oil. I bet if you fact check this it will be 60% lies.
3628 2018-04-12 17:58:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3629 2018-04-12 17:58:32 Tell me why olive oil smells like silly putty
3630 2018-04-12 17:58:31 Not one you can buy but I make my own body scrub and I use brown sugar, a honey, a little shea butter and a few drops of jojoba oil and it makes my skin glow 
3631 2018-04-12 17:58:28 Russia, Israel, and Syria must make a deal about the pipeline through Syria bringing oil and gas from Golan Heights to Europe. The deal must be fair to Russia, losing the market in Europe, must be fair to Syria, whose oil it is, fair to Israel that won the land and has the means.
3632 2018-04-12 17:58:26 Nice. Will the Gearbox still be functional? Or would you lock it to a specific gear?
I really think about converting my 126p to electric, cause the engine is always leaking oil, really annoying!
3633 2018-04-12 17:58:12 Is an oil pipeline required for this type of sustainability?
3634 2018-04-12 17:58:07 So presumably a #plastic bottle of olive oil or nay #cooking oil will have micro plastic in it which you take into your #bodies 
Buy glass
3635 2018-04-12 17:57:55 Why is there vegetable oil on your desk?
3636 2018-04-12 17:57:52 Also, coconut oil is comedogenic, so you want to be careful (at least if you’re putting it on your face)
3637 2018-04-12 17:57:47 If we do nothing then the self proclaimed  Islamic Army (the rebels) will grow and spread and take over Syria with their own oil to propel them into modern warfare and revive sharia law. Supporting the very people who attacked us is very disturbing for me.
3638 2018-04-12 17:57:46 It's about oil & which "groups" we've made alliances w/and Saudi has been 1 of the favored few in the ME even when Saudis have NOT been "friendly" to Israel. There does seem to be a shift with the regime change in SA. Maybe this will end up being a positive stabilizing influence.
3639 2018-04-12 17:57:40 The thought of raw dogging Private Baby Hands makes me want to peel my skin off and boil it in oil.
3640 2018-04-12 17:57:37 This is the lie ... No we do not need to continue our addiction ... There are viable alternatives and they have been available for some time. If we had put our resources toward developing them instead of continuing our addiction to oil years ago, thing would be very different
3641 2018-04-12 17:57:33 @CleanArctic Interesting tactic from a nation with the stated goal of decarbonisation and making electricity production 100% renewable by 2030. Apparently, it's hard to understand that these local efforts to avoid emissions will effectively be nullified by faroese oil industry.
3642 2018-04-12 17:57:31 i get d oil , you get d highlight!
3643 2018-04-12 17:57:30 @Sage_Trader I didn’t go on leverage but VERY aggressive on $XES Oil field plays are rarely this obvious. Once every 5-10 years opportunity
3644 2018-04-12 17:57:27 My software says:  buy GE at $13. Oil and oil service sectors are attractive such as RIG.  Buy at your own risk.
3645 2018-04-12 17:57:24  He's also more likely to get something expensive that I can't justify buying myself.. like mochi or a new olive oil or cheese. He has a thing for those. 
3646 2018-04-12 17:57:21 3000 is the recommended limit newer cars can go to 5 but 3 is being safe then sorry cause motor damage in any way will cost you more then an oil change and make sure to change your oil filter too
3647 2018-04-12 17:57:13 If the oil was sold above the budgeted benchmark or not ma?
3648 2018-04-12 17:57:07 @richardacarbo Oil and Gas investment in south Louisiana is trailing the rest of the country. Job losses in Lafayette and Houma have been tops in the nation… and governmental lawsuits are absolutely a driving factor…it doesn’t matter who is filing the lawsuits… the state loses

Beat with electric mixer on medium speed 3 minutes, scraping bowl frequently. Stir in enough remaining flour until dough is soft and leaves sides of bowl. Place dough on
3651 2018-04-12 17:56:56 Russia, Israel, and Syria must make a deal about the pipeline through Syria bringing oil and gas from Golan Heights to Europe. The deal must be fair to Russia, losing the market in Europe, must be fair to Syria, whose oil it is, fair to Israel that won the land and has the means.

3658 2018-04-12 17:56:03 @POTUS pentagon and elites want Syria for it's oil.china is setting up a war between US and russia.they get stronger while we drain our military strength.
3659 2018-04-12 17:55:56 Well tbh the way I clean my face is coconut oil and I get a clean rag and add super hot water and it cleans all the dirt deep inside then I use that mask and I do some oatmeal honey ones and lots of aloe  my skin might not be perfect but it’s damn clean 
3660 2018-04-12 17:55:48 We are oil addicts. But there are 4 technologies we can utilize which deflate their ownership of our economy and thus our lives: geothermal, biomass, wind, solar, and then there is increased effort in relying on tech to reduce our use of any of these.  We.....
3661 2018-04-12 17:55:47 Who says the US is going to hit and run? Park a Carrier Strike Group off Syria and hit Assad's forces whenever they stick their head out from under Russia's skirts. Roll back Assad's recent gains and capture of oil and gas fields.

3664 2018-04-12 17:55:41 El sábado abre fuel oil, no queda otra que ir
3665 2018-04-12 17:55:39 The combination of the quantity of cars dripping oil, combined with the infrequency of cleansing rain, exacerbates the problems.
3666 2018-04-12 17:55:33 Non-conflict palm oil IS A MYTH!!! #PALMISPOISON
3667 2018-04-12 17:55:28 Then they use the same investors tax cuts to fund nonprofit #HateCrime #HolocaustRemembranceDay

3683 2018-04-12 17:53:57 If you think you don’t need oil then you are profoundly mistaken.
#KeepItInTheGround
3684 2018-04-12 17:53:51 Emu oil contains oleic acid, which reduces inflammation. Omega 6 and Omega 3, essential fatty acids, are also found in Emu oil and are well known to support the nutritional needs of your skin.
3685 2018-04-12 17:53:47 We should stick to Iran, gas and oil are much better than Israeli oranges, me thinks.
3686 2018-04-12 17:53:46 Have you tried the Garnier Sleek Perfector Oil too?  It’s my favourite out of all the oils I’ve ever tried  xoxo
3687 2018-04-12 17:53:37 It's a sad story. But basically those people just want to further their "national interest"...and that is:
Get more oil and other resources from elsewhere via invasions every 10 years.
That keeps gas prices low and the US dollar strong.
It's killing and leeching negate deficit.
3688 2018-04-12 17:53:31 Ugh I already need an oil change 
3689 2018-04-12 17:53:23 Course Mike just had a wee bit of bad memory there when he neglected to inform Congress that he is in business with a Chinese oil & gas company. Another good pick there Donnie. But like they say. ‘ Birds of a feather”. Haha.
3690 2018-04-12 17:53:21 What a waste, keep it up humans and pretty soon it will be us that will be suffocating on bad air, trying to drink oil, eat plastic and coal, while drowning in polluted water.
3691 2018-04-12 17:53:08 Weka canola oil bro
3692 2018-04-12 17:53:03 Two things, 1) is he expensive? 2) I know nothing about olive oil so you’d have to put me on
3693 2018-04-12 17:53:02 Pompey is a slick, lying snake oil salesman.

3695 2018-04-12 17:52:52 The Country ones depended on Agriculture until we discovered Crude oil, its quite unfortunate that we left Agriculture for crude oil .

Well, I hope the meeting held today will revive Agricultural sector in Nigeria ...
3696 2018-04-12 17:52:52 The annoying thing is that palm oil is in most vegan alternative foods ... such as vegan butter, cookies etc ... I’ve been vegan for a month and keep seeing palm oil in everything
3697 2018-04-12 17:52:34 hi Jin, If you have time for 2 quick qs.  1. are you still short oil? and do you think 2700 is still on deck here? thanks if you can reply. and If not it's cool. I appreciate the free info and respect your time and kindness.
3698 2018-04-12 17:52:21 @PeterSchiff issue of rising rates along with oil bubble and tech bubble created by financial and political speculators will create massive distortions in corporate profits leading to distress in earnings ending up with another crisis and bailouts
3699 2018-04-12 17:52:21 Of course. The only hope is replacement. Factory farming is not feeding the world in a profitable or even sustainable way. Environmental costs are hidden through subsidies of grains and petroleum. It isn't just about green house gas, it's also about eliminating oil based ag
3700 2018-04-12 17:52:20 You obviously have never dealt with oil/mineral rich land owning, or the rules that apply once you own share(s) in it.
3701 2018-04-12 17:52:20 Close. But it’s actually Money and Oil.
3702 2018-04-12 17:52:16 Shimmering dry body oil is not new but.... carry on.
3703 2018-04-12 17:51:51 #ConfidenceinCanada is a farce. Keep dirty oil in the  ground and find positive, forward-thinking investments that benefit Canada and the planet. #StopKM

3709 2018-04-12 17:51:16 sue. the way I was thinking about it is that the energy piece (US as net energy exporter) but the fiscal stance provides offset. Also just a natural reaction anytime someone talks about oil price is to think about what price it will be in local currency for major producers/buyers
3710 2018-04-12 17:50:49 I used to baby oil cause I was just too cheap for tanning oil lmaoo
3711 2018-04-12 17:50:49 No we aren't trying anything against you just that his shirt wasn't sprayed. It's deadass oil you can smell that shit.
3712 2018-04-12 17:50:41 @SarahPalinUSA  ...screaming about our oil addiction in the 70's. Now that the energy powers that be have obtained control over alternate energy options, we can clearly praise all the wind farms that they own... but at what cost to US?:
3713 2018-04-12 17:50:37 Where can I get CBD oil?

3718 2018-04-12 17:50:21 KM has never had a pipeline break and pipelines are the safest way to transport oil which protects the environment.

3721 2018-04-12 17:50:06 I'll all say about the streaming wars is when the studios had to size down their production in the 1950s due to a shrinking market, they began selling oil rights on the lots and told the engineers to fix the sets so the sound wouldn't interrupt their work.

3726 2018-04-12 17:49:42 Even if/when the pipeline gets built, it will be a shortsighted, short term endeavour, especially if the improvements and adoption of alternative energies outpace the market for Alberta crude oil.

3744 2018-04-12 17:48:36 @SarahPalinUSA I have been on this since the 70's. Our mission should be to remove ourselves from oil addiction, if for no other reason than that the battles we have most recently fought have been truly to preserve our ability to purchase oil from the middle east. I started...
3745 2018-04-12 17:48:12 Owwww, oil up a grime bae for me
3746 2018-04-12 17:48:09 Can you explain how will the oil refinery which will be miles away in the sea affect the mango farms?? Also, massive solar city will have a massive maintenance.  Stop opposing just for the sake of opposing without any logic. NO WONDER YOU ARE A PAPPU  FOLLOWER
3747 2018-04-12 17:48:02 Some days, I just be wanting to give it all up and eat oil down on a black sand beach in Grenada
3748 2018-04-12 17:48:02 coconut oil can clog pores & cause burns as well! I actually sell an oil with my company @GetLeighedCos with a natural spf in it as well!

3750 2018-04-12 17:47:58 World’s largest Oil refinery will come in Ratnagiri and will massively destroy mango farms and ecology. 

@Dev_Fadnavis is letting Saudi Arabia for this. Ironically, Saudi is investing in Solar at home but dirty oil in India. 

Another sell out of our country?
3751 2018-04-12 17:47:21 Yes b’ye, that’ll help get the oil to the tankers
3752 2018-04-12 17:47:20 @realDonaldTrump Mister President ! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners, a lot of people assesinated who protested against this government. There are hunger, and a lack of medicines. A real mess!
3753 2018-04-12 17:47:16 and oil! a lot of oil!!
3754 2018-04-12 17:47:15 Should you not be ashamed to tweet this? GEJ's pet project yet he abandoned it despite the sale of oil at $100 per barrel during his administration.
3755 2018-04-12 17:47:13 It’s not about taking their oil for our own gain. The strategy being employed, which I don’t agree with by the way, is simply to deny the region the oil as it would enable them to prosper on their own volition. Civilization requires a sponsor apparently.
3756 2018-04-12 17:47:11 "call me tea tree cause my oil is essential as fuck"

3779 2018-04-12 17:44:39 Yesss, we just need baby oil lol
3780 2018-04-12 17:44:16 Try using sweet almond oil or jojoba oil instead! They cost a little more but it’ll be better for your skin!
3781 2018-04-12 17:44:11 Can you elaborate as to why flammable drinking water with alarm you? Asking for an oil company friend…

3792 2018-04-12 17:43:01 This is definitely the case, but his point was that the oil is in Canada as well.  People there seem pretty motivated and pissed off.  I am sure that every province or region has a crack pot seperatist movement.  I know Alberta and Quebec has one.

3815 2018-04-12 17:40:26 Thanks for the reply. I took it back to the store, so I won’t be able to get that for you. I’ve been eating Smuckers pb for over 30 years. Love the natural ingredients so I’ll still keep buying . I’ve just never seen that much oil before!

Is oil wet? 
Yes, yes it is. 
Oil repels water. 
Therefore if oil is wet so is water.

3827 2018-04-12 17:39:31 Yup, and then the anti-climate science Big Oil elements took over the Libs and undemocratically ousted Dion. The Lib-Cons should have merged at that point. Their anti-climate action policies have been identical ever since. Now we won't even meet Harper's carbon reduction targets.
3828 2018-04-12 17:39:29 I can confirm that. Saudis have invested worth $200 billion in solar projects they are shifting from oil economy to service. They know after 50 yrs oil will not be available .

3831 2018-04-12 17:39:19 Oil.

Topple Assad, set up a pipeline through Syria to Israel to move the oil West.
With Iran backing Assad the war could lead there and would lead to an “end-game” of the vast swathes of Iranian oil.

Note: I’m not saying this is the case, but it holds merit given Iraq.

3835 2018-04-12 17:39:10 Most of the oil produced in NZ high quality is exported the bulk of the oil we use is imported and refined into petrol and NZ receives very low royalties from oil reserves discovered.

3850 2018-04-12 17:38:06 Thank you for the correction. In my mind the rail cars contained oil sands with dilutent. However, the producer was not held responsible in any way for damages.
3851 2018-04-12 17:38:02 Just as the 2003 Iraq War has been linked to oil in the Persian Gulf, Syria may turn out to be all about gas.

3855 2018-04-12 17:37:51 As long as your car has enough oil, it’ll be fine. The real trouble is when the oil drops below the set amount. Idk how to explain it but you can prob google how to check your cars oil

3859 2018-04-12 17:37:31 Yes, but I go with what we do know. Ergo reason Bruges Group publish my articles.  Facts trump guesswork. And we know Syria is sitting on SHALE and OIL. More oil than Saudi. Now who gains from Assad going down? Some foreign co that will pay next to zero taxes as kids die. @POTUS
3860 2018-04-12 17:37:30 I’m getting my oil changed right now too and I didn’t get that flattery treatment. Did to cost extra?

3866 2018-04-12 17:37:10 Surely even If they want to set up an oil refinery, there must be so much land lying barren in MH. Just what idiotic brain will choose one of the best mango ecosystem to set up this plant.  This most be the most anti environmental government ever.
3867 2018-04-12 17:37:08 I agree, sustainable palm oil is a much more desirable alternative to ‘conflict’ palm oil.
Yet is it really necessary to pack palm oil into over 50% of all products? I’m not advocating replacing it, I’m suggesting we eradicate it from many products that simply don’t require it.
3868 2018-04-12 17:37:04 We can also export oil now- which is kind of a big deal geopolitically and economically- that was part of one his spending measures that plenty of people gave him crap for.

3874 2018-04-12 17:36:24 40% of Indian now live in cities

It is expected to be over 60% in next 10 years 

Urbanisation is bound to happen and cities shall expand because of many reasons mostly economic

Our per capita oil consumption is still very low. What will we do when more use oil?
3875 2018-04-12 17:36:23 Some people automatically assume that everyone who simply supports energy diversification wants to obstruct all oil/gas/ metallurgical coal development. That assumption is dead wrong. Not everything is either-or. Again, there is value in middle ground.
3876 2018-04-12 17:36:21 Jack your car up and find the oil valve that’s under your car, look up a vid and you’ll see where it is. Make sure to get a decent sized oil pan cuz that shit is messy
3877 2018-04-12 17:36:20 Can’t we just kill a few? We need the Gas and Oil pipeline 
3878 2018-04-12 17:36:17 Washing  my coveralls  because  grease definitely  does not smell  as good as oil im dieing
3879 2018-04-12 17:36:11 No argument on cause, it’s probably more complicated than just oil, but it doesn’t matter now. We need to be outta there. Let Israel manage the region.

3883 2018-04-12 17:35:43 How can liberals want clean energy but also want to invest a countless amount of money in an oil pipeline? Why would we waste the money to develop this now when we're trying to get away from oil?
3884 2018-04-12 17:35:42 Sitting outside at the auto shop while my car gets new oil & an old man who works here says, “we need to sell you that porch ‘cause you look so good on it” ...uh thanks, I think?

3898 2018-04-12 17:34:43 if this refinery is ever set up, it will be an economic disaster as oil demand is expected to fall sharply in the next few years with the advent of electric vehicles. Wonder why a country which has surplus refining capacity investing in  another mega refinery @dpradhanbjp
3899 2018-04-12 17:34:38 My sauce that comes on the #5 Vito and the #9 Italian? It's an Italian Vinaigrette made with pure olive oil blend and red wine vinegar. If you're thinking of another sauce, email any questions to feedback@jimmyjohns.com and they can check it out for you!
3900 2018-04-12 17:34:38 here's a fact: your funding comes from oil barons who also fund think tanks to put out disinformation so that pundits (like you) will quote them forever until it's accepted as fact.
3901 2018-04-12 17:34:28 I haven't washed my hair for so many days, I could literally squeeze oil in to a Dabur Amla bottle
3902 2018-04-12 17:34:24 This marketing campaign by big oil is so disengenuous.  Just admitted they agree with climate change science in CA court.  Further investing in low carbon future. Just protecting shareholders from lawsuits.

3906 2018-04-12 17:34:06 Taa sir! But a lot of folks on YouTube apparently confusing "service light" with "oil light". I reset the oil light no worries... but the new warning needs computer apparently. Joy!
3907 2018-04-12 17:34:04 we don't want pipelines. get them to build something we can use after the oil is gone like high speed rail instead. they destroy nature dropping these pipelines, then leave them there forever when they're done, not to mention the threat of spills.

Try #NewZealand's easy one step program to becoming a responsible nation. #ProTip it's a lot easier to decarbonise without trying to become an oil nation at the same time.

3917 2018-04-12 17:33:10 Macron finds it convenient to argue for targeting Syria while he sells weapons to the Saudis to slaughter women and children in Yemen. Typical French duplicity in all Middle East matters. Can't separate the French from oil.
3918 2018-04-12 17:32:53 Yes they tried foolishly to get an oil field from the rebellion protected by the us forces !!!! They had been wiped out ....that was on the news several weeks ago. Who sent the order to do that ? Putin testing the American resolve ? Badly failed fir the Russians 
3919 2018-04-12 17:32:45 Ok no problem.  How about no more MASSIVE transfer payments to Quebec??? Because we can no longer fund that without the money from the oil! This is the point.  Without oil revenue we cannot keep the environment clean.  We need money to do that!  DUH!

4011 2018-04-12 17:24:30 reason why anyone trading oil will parse Trump's words when he makes his announcement.
4012 2018-04-12 17:24:25 How im gonna catch a hottie if she all slicked up with oil, like chasing a greased pig
4013 2018-04-12 17:24:23 Two factors make the Trump and Iran issue important to the oil market. First is the chance that Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress go a step further than mere decertification and re-impose sanctions on Iran's oil sector. That's one
4014 2018-04-12 17:24:22 @jayne_ritchie4 Can you ask your friend where she got that oil from please? Thankyou x
4015 2018-04-12 17:24:21 Just as lobbies have done a great job on filling the region with ISIS providing guns and buying oil from them,and now they would like to see Assad gone so they can take power of the placewe're not stupid,and honestly I tought you were a different President.Greetings frm Italy
4016 2018-04-12 17:24:15 Why do oil changes take forever? 
4017 2018-04-12 17:24:13 Pussy > coconut oil
4018 2018-04-12 17:24:08 Put some tea tree oil on that bad boy. Take it from me the minister of public zits

4020 2018-04-12 17:23:52 Madam Secretary has an episode about Yasuni, oil and the whole past thing about the problem with Chevron  this is the content I’m signed up
4021 2018-04-12 17:23:38 I Gotta Get My Oil Changed.
4022 2018-04-12 17:23:28 How would we know if it wasn't truth if they won't allow an investigation?
And Israel? 
Everyone in the world knows that the UN prostitutes itself for Arab oil dollars
4023 2018-04-12 17:23:17 50p chete kana olive oil even cooking oil. Kana mvura yekungoti oo oo
4024 2018-04-12 17:23:11 Where’s the oil spill, tho, b cause it’s smelling rough. #mississippiriver
4025 2018-04-12 17:23:05 @ChickfilA really will do anything for their customers including helping me put oil in my car thank u
4026 2018-04-12 17:23:03 Somebody come get my car & take it to go get an oil change I’m to lazy
4027 2018-04-12 17:22:58 Hi Mark,

thanks for your interest and concern. We’re passionate about pledging palm oil free on our own label products, but this is just the start. We’re speaking to all of our branded suppliers too and encouraging them to make the change too!
4028 2018-04-12 17:22:56 from???  A lot of it is because of resource revenues.  Especially oil.  You blew it at that point.  That is why you are a HYPOCRITE! Give me the money but don't build a pipeline because it spills!  DUH!
4029 2018-04-12 17:22:54 what’s THE BEST stretch mark cream/oil? don’t say vitamin e oil or coconut oil because that shit ain’t working. never had a stretch mark in my life but im losing a lot of weight and bam, here they come. I got like 4 now 
4030 2018-04-12 17:22:51 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If as I believe you are - you aim to target dodgy banks re human trafficking and drug monies, then you must do same for dodgy oil monies linked to proxy wars? It is called being ETHICAL.
4031 2018-04-12 17:22:49 Like vitamin S from snake oil
4032 2018-04-12 17:22:49 If Quebec was located where Alberta is and they had the oil sands,does anyone seriously think a pipeline would not already be in place?
4033 2018-04-12 17:22:46 Pake baby oil johnson and johnson deh. Wanginya subtle jadi ga bikin puyeng 
4034 2018-04-12 17:22:39 Have you ever heard of oil? Is Saudi Arabia also a shithole in the desert? Why doesn't the US fight against them, the most undemocratic regime in the world? And of course Putin doesn't care about democracy, but he's on the right side in this particular conflict.
4035 2018-04-12 17:22:34 you can change tatt artist with anything people have to pay for...producer, graphic designer, realtor, caterer, car wash, oil change...i hardly even pursue those posts...
4036 2018-04-12 17:22:32 She does not represent the people. She represents oil/arms/Banks.   All after a piece of the Syrian cake!   Their propaganda on this one was obvious from Day 1 -  “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.” #stopoilwars#savesyria#weluvsyria
4037 2018-04-12 17:22:24 Not defending a corporation. The oil is coming one way or another, let's get on with it.
4038 2018-04-12 17:22:24 Coconut oil ? This kid will go far in life, taking care of hair is a battle.

Ps: I want to smell his hair too 
And I want Canary touching mine too
4039 2018-04-12 17:22:17 Like oil rigs giant pontoons, or perhaps floating low density concrete structures as were proposed for concept OTEC power plants.
4040 2018-04-12 17:22:14 Use extra virgin oil, apply it at night ........it worked for me
4041 2018-04-12 17:22:01 Ubos kuna baby oil at tissue namin dito, kakapanuod ko sayo. urgh
4042 2018-04-12 17:21:58 how weak Canada if the lack of a pipeline expansion is crushing the economy #WakeUP who earns more off this TarSand Oil? #TexasorAlberta #TexasorCanada?
4043 2018-04-12 17:21:48 someone teach me how to change the oil on my BMW I hate getting my oil changed
4044 2018-04-12 17:21:37 He is actually aren’t widespread condemnation as a complete slave to the oil and gas industry. Yet another embarrassment for the Republicans. We will remember that in November.
4045 2018-04-12 17:21:26 It's like cleaning a window with motor oil and wondering why you can't see out of it...
4046 2018-04-12 17:21:05 If you use synthetic oil, you can go about 5k-6k
4047 2018-04-12 17:21:02 100 days have made me older, since the last time that I saw your pretty face
4048 2018-04-12 17:20:49 #Studies have shown that giving #hempseed oil to people with #eczema may improve blood levels of essential fatty acids.
4049 2018-04-12 17:20:45 Will it "Protect" Indian oil refineries??
4050 2018-04-12 17:20:33 .@portilloshotdog can you please reduce the amount of oil you add in your fettuccine carbonara? not trynna die here
4051 2018-04-12 17:20:29 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4052 2018-04-12 17:20:29 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4053 2018-04-12 17:20:27 If you haven’t checked your oil in a while, you might want to get on that. It’ll increase the life of your vehicle and save on repairs.

What? Sometimes we give real advice.
4054 2018-04-12 17:20:21 It is about SHALE GAS and OIL. More oil under Golan Heights than in SAUDI. Fact. I said all this before GE15.  Proxy wars like Libya, Iraq etc all have 1 common link. Multicorps killing kids for profit. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Should I do it as a JOIN THE DOTS for the 5 EYES?
4055 2018-04-12 17:20:13 Because it's his "rational well thought out argument" that the pipeline is bad but hasn't considered the oil will still flow, via trains, to get to the port.
4056 2018-04-12 17:20:05 Lookin like you were covered in oil and some scientists saved you and cleaned you up, now you all safe and fluffy and its 2 months later.

These are the days of our lives.
4057 2018-04-12 17:19:43 My silver price target remains $26. And yes PMs & miners poised for a big move here. Oil is still in a low 60's to high 60's trading range. Continue to see this as the end of the 2 yr counter-trend rally from $26. Rollover will take it to $10 in the bust.
4058 2018-04-12 17:19:37 Going to get my oil change when I get off
4059 2018-04-12 17:19:36 It’s #airbnb season in #nola y’all! All the tourists are in town for [Music Festival] Presented By [Oil Company], destroying South Louisiana’s natural defenses from the outside while renters are forced out. #FrenchQuarterFest #JazzFest

4061 2018-04-12 17:19:31 What makes an oil essential? Are they the ones that still have to go in on snow days?

They dont need to keep damaging the environment with butter&lard. It is VERY important that we all tell them how we feel!

4065 2018-04-12 17:19:26 Ugh I feel you! my wisdom teeth have been killing me. Did you end up going to the dentist? Try to put some coconut oil on the area that hurts, it won’t help completely but it will a little.
4066 2018-04-12 17:19:11 Because is all about power! They want control the oil
4067 2018-04-12 17:19:10 My darling, the night and its sky

And you and I
My darling, my life
We are in love with each other
And love, ah love, sleepless love
It waters us with happiness and congratulates us
4068 2018-04-12 17:18:59 (I’m not hinting at such a thing. I dated a guy who worked on an oil rig for about six months outside of Vancouver. It was a few weeks prep, it was hard work.) I’m not sure your point. Education levels are proven to not correlate to pay equity.
4069 2018-04-12 17:18:59 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
4070 2018-04-12 17:18:56 Hi Alexis! A tablespoon of olive oil would totally work in place of the butter. I've also been using one of those vegan butterlike alternatives these days. Pretty similar in taste to real butter + much easier than before to find at the grocery store ;) Happy cooking!
4071 2018-04-12 17:18:55 Oil changed

Now to water plants and give a final look at my notes for saturday's meeting.  #Grinding
4072 2018-04-12 17:18:51 When a snake oil saleman politician tries to sell me a vision & "happyclappy" blind optimism as a fantasy,my bullshitometer starts twitching. Indy is DEAD. Accept that & your mental health will be a lot better.
4073 2018-04-12 17:18:45 Was just reminding a flat mate that Syria (and Iran) have been targeted for invasion since 2001, and that the same people are using the same lies as they did to manufacture consent for the Iraq invasion. Seriously, the government LIES for oil, and mainstream media are their PR.
4074 2018-04-12 17:18:40 She's said the truth tho cos now a days in Ghana aba 40%-50% of the ladies do depend on men. When u chatting a lady up now a day she asks WHAT DO U DO? at times I say I work with a gild mine or oil and when I wanna be snobbish I say I'm a shit collector. Lmao!

4079 2018-04-12 17:18:17 I'm not a fan that Pompeo has been taking advice from Hillary Clinton on who to keep in place at the State Department... It has also been reported that he has undisclosed business interests in an oil company tied to the Chinese government. 
4080 2018-04-12 17:18:15 I got this blackberry kush oil and I think it is probably the best oil I’ve ever smelled, almost sugary sweet.
4081 2018-04-12 17:18:12 Fox News Anchors know that when the President has a toddler tantrum, a russian bot subscibes to the #NYT

4092 2018-04-12 17:17:34 I hope this car be ready soon! Shit I’m tired of buying oil & putting gas in MYSELF. When it’s two people driving this mf.

4094 2018-04-12 17:17:28 Did we bomb Milosevic for oil and minerals?
4095 2018-04-12 17:17:10 Fascinating talks at the @CUBoulder Hydrologic Sciences conference on how oil and gas drilling influence Colorado #water resources!
4096 2018-04-12 17:17:08 I remember!   I was an assistant to Paul Bernbaum, a writer on the show, at Stephen Cannell Productions in Hollywood.  We really burned the midnight oil on that show!
4097 2018-04-12 17:16:57 Not enough to charge an electric vehicle quickly. No matter, the electricity comes from coal, gas, oil. The amount from tide, wind, solar is minuscule.
The current electrical infrastructure cannot support millions of cars being charged at the same time
4098 2018-04-12 17:16:49 i use jojoba and almond oil sometimes. for stuff like beards i got some castor/jojoba/grapeseed oil combination

4105 2018-04-12 17:16:12 In Washington DC, legislators are beholden to campaign donors like pharma, oil, etc. Locally, legislators are beholden to campaign donors like real estate developers seeking favorable zoning or exemptions.
4106 2018-04-12 17:16:10 My current skincare routine consists of:
•tea tree wash (every other day cause it’ll dry u out if used daily)
I only use oil based make up remover, bcuz idk it works and my face isn’t dried out completely. 
•then I tone with micellar water
•I just started exfoliating with..
4107 2018-04-12 17:16:01 Their products are definitely good! I love the rose hip oil and it’s lasted me awhile and there is still so much left. I definitely want to check out the local place though! I love small businesses so if there’s one near by I definitely want to check them out
4108 2018-04-12 17:15:58 No one takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, uses oil or perfume in his house, then proceeds for prayer, and does not separate two persons sitting together, then prays as much as is written for him,
4109 2018-04-12 17:15:55 This is so similar to the run up to Iraq. Inspectors never found WMD’s yet invasion still happened. What lousy politicians there are. All about oil,money & probably an Israeli connection
4110 2018-04-12 17:15:51 Glad to see the food shop Iceland are stopping using palm oil in their own brand foods completely by next year
4111 2018-04-12 17:15:27 IMHO, it’s self-evident that social networks are a major development in human communication. But if there are areas where their use for marketing is grossly overstated then, in those areas, they are like “snake oil”. #innochat

4113 2018-04-12 17:15:25 For the women on my TL, wassup with that glittery oil stuff ya’ll got trending now? Is it to make ya’ll glow? Do it smell good? I’m just confused of it’s purpose.
4114 2018-04-12 17:15:22 Short version:Russia has controlling interest in a company that owns a mine that represents +/- 20%. of our known reserves. No one really knows  how the size of our Uranium reserves,just like oil. That's where the 20% came from. Mining is an ongoing operation until it's mined out
4115 2018-04-12 17:15:21 Not to many networks NOT funded by big oil. What's your point. You support an organization that was funded by the Russian govt and oligarchy. Those in glass houses....
4116 2018-04-12 17:15:14 Man I’d love to do this...if I wasn’t scared of oil  (don’t judge me) 
4117 2018-04-12 17:15:09 6% growth rate with oil selling above $100 and geometric decline to 2% growth rate with oil above $70,borrowing to pay salaries,owing contractors, pensioners,disengaged staff,abadoned projects,depleting reserve. You think recession is a decree?

U are the one with issues really.

4119 2018-04-12 17:15:00 After a couple of hours flying that thing I think that I would go aft to the "oil cooker" and warm up.
4120 2018-04-12 17:14:52 No plan- no objective??? Then no action. What would be the point and we could make things worse. If not oil then it has to be for minerals. These people, like Saudis in Yemen, won't be spending millions for nothing
4121 2018-04-12 17:14:50 New York really just said "ever since I got my new nose a lot of Indian men have been hitting on me, I'm into it they probably got oil n shit girl" LOVE HERRR

4124 2018-04-12 17:14:24 will wti oil go down?... it's seems to be raising higher..
4125 2018-04-12 17:14:23 Really? Trump is going to allow a handful of oil speculators to raise the price of oil just between themselves? I guess Obama was more powerful than Trump in stopping this practice by threatening regulation. Again, Obama trumped Trump.

4128 2018-04-12 17:14:18 The biggest problem that Venezuela had is that they had only one giant export, oil, and when the recession happen all around the world: 1 of the effects was decrease of oil prices which then caused the Venezuelan economy to break.

4138 2018-04-12 17:12:49 Take care of your feet because everywhere you go physically, your feet take you there. Soak the feet. Wax the feet. Pedicure the feet. Oil the feet down with Peppermint (or Wintergreen, Spearmint), Spikenard, and Lavender essential oils and massage.
4139 2018-04-12 17:12:39 Let me get you straight, we’re going to bomb Syria because of 100% baseless propaganda claims of Assad using CW. And ignore Yemen and Israel and Saudi’s and every other thing that doesn’t serve our imperialist agenda-which is always oil, resources, power and money. Never freedom.
4140 2018-04-12 17:12:38 Good timing re:oil price
4141 2018-04-12 17:12:34 I Hate Politics, But .. 
Chemical weapons, the same story is returned
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria .. Many international experts and Americans have provided that Iraq Never owned weapons of mass destruction ..

Its the Oil War or Call it PetroDollar
#Syria
4142 2018-04-12 17:12:21 So the “social network” is snake oil. #innochat
4143 2018-04-12 17:12:14 Sometimes I like to pretend I’m in the Cinderella Story movie acting as Sam meeting my Austin Ames when I get my oil changed. Am I alone in that? Asking for a friend.
4144 2018-04-12 17:12:12 I can't wait to get some of that almond oil and do this because I've got highlighter for years 
4145 2018-04-12 17:12:00 Everybody knows that US and their criminals allies France uk and Isreal that were ex empires killing bombing Africans Arabs and Muslims are looking for clue to divide Syria Like Irak Yemen Libya dividing them to small areas and take the oil for satisfying Isreal's project
4146 2018-04-12 17:11:55 FINALLY SOMEONE WHO AGREES i fucking hate the smell of baby oil and powder also why call it baby oil and baby powder its so weird when someone uses it who istn a baby

4149 2018-04-12 17:11:34 Inb4 it turns out to be another snake oil scam to farm donations from well meaning but naive rubes.
4150 2018-04-12 17:11:31 Booker is very creepy if you ask me....like that snake oil salesmen telling you his product is a cure all.
4151 2018-04-12 17:11:30 YES! Emphatically yes! Hence the reason ALL of Canada benefits from the Oil & Gas sector in both AB & SASK! Or have you not been paying attention??
4152 2018-04-12 17:11:25 Go to Walmart and get tattoo goo there’s this sunflower oil paste and it’s good for the color in ur tattoos and helps heal it faster
4153 2018-04-12 17:11:23 I was a crazy asshole yesterday! So today, I’m going to put oil in my hair, watch CMBYN, and finish my taxes.
4154 2018-04-12 17:11:16 They do not have unlimited cash but on the contrary their reserves are shrinking due to low oil prices and stiff competition from more strategic ports like gwadwar in pakistan and doraleh in djobouti, their main objective is to slide somalia back to civil war to avoid that fate
4155 2018-04-12 17:11:16 My dry body oil from @KrazyEssentials will be delivered today! I got the shimmer in rose gold and the scent in buttered rum. I’m bout to get ate like cake this weekend you hear me?!
4156 2018-04-12 17:11:09 @syria_true Approx 2000 people now know about the OIL and SHALE GAS in Syria who did not know an hour ago. The power of social media. @UN @UNICEF Do I need to do it as a JOIN THE DOTS for the UN?
4157 2018-04-12 17:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: crispy crust with sweet motor oil and cheese.
4158 2018-04-12 17:10:57 Find a good moisturiser or use coconut oil 
4159 2018-04-12 17:10:44 The days of military action without clear proof should be over @EmmanuelMacron @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump
International agreements & transparency should prevail. The world has had enough of wishy-washy ‘wars’ where there just happens to be oil. People of #Syria deserve better!
4160 2018-04-12 17:10:37 also for headaches frankincense essential oil and ice pack = tension headache be gone - i'm 100% serious its cured my migraines
4161 2018-04-12 17:10:36 When the bible said, "thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over," I FELT THAT!!!!
4162 2018-04-12 17:10:32 Assad is winning the civil war. why risk the wrath of western powers eager to further solidify their position in the ME and weaken chances of regaining the illegally held (current US position) Golan heights and its vast oil/mineral potential?
4163 2018-04-12 17:10:28 Baby oil and baby powder have to be the worst smells
4164 2018-04-12 17:10:28 Why should I support the troops at all?  

Dark money Nazi petrol dollar oil guards who protect the free fall towards extinction?
4165 2018-04-12 17:10:23 Alberta is at max capacity right now.We need pipelines to replace old infrastructure & to increase production. There is more then just bitumen in this province.  We also have some beautiful light oil.  Pipelines are the safest and most economical way to transport this & all oil.
4166 2018-04-12 17:10:22 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
4167 2018-04-12 17:10:22 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
4168 2018-04-12 17:10:13 YOUR NO CLIMATE LEADER...just a puppet for the Oil Corps! No honor. Protect the land, the water and the people? Yeah right!
4169 2018-04-12 17:10:13 The global trade of oil is in the form of crude ... doesn't make sense to ship refined goods to export market or even domestic market. You refine the raw material upstream, near the point of usage. Crude goes to many products plus different grades of fuel.
4170 2018-04-12 17:10:08 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
4171 2018-04-12 17:10:06 Pompeo who was recently nominated by Trump to be secretary of State failed to disclose his business' ties to a Chinese government oil and gas company in the questionnaire he was required to fill out to be confirmed as CIA director by the Senate.

That omission could be an issue .
4172 2018-04-12 17:10:05 Just had a convo with a client on the west coast. It turned to pipelines. told him coast belongs to Canada & we have aright to access w/ best practices in place. He replied, how come you don't see it that way with the oil & all the blab about transfers? I had no answer #ableg
4173 2018-04-12 17:10:04 Oil change = Highway ready 
4174 2018-04-12 17:09:57 Green tea. Banyak review mengatakan kalau dia oil control banget tanpa mengurangi kelembapan
4175 2018-04-12 17:09:51 Dinosaurs Thrived for 150million years, in a 1600-4000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 380ppm.  Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice.  We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.

4177 2018-04-12 17:09:37 Almond oil will be safer than baby oil.
4178 2018-04-12 17:09:34 for all u bald bitches that wanna make your hair grow use olive or coconut oil
4179 2018-04-12 17:09:27 KM pipeline to our coast is bad

Why, do tell

My traditional fishing grounds are on the Fraser River, and I'd much sooner have the oil we all need safely traveling down a pipeline than inside tens of thousands of rail cars traveling only meters away from us fishing #BuildKM
4180 2018-04-12 17:09:26 Boa tarde pra quem se banha de bio oil

4182 2018-04-12 17:09:16 Makes no sense. If you consider that the US is leader in oil and gas extraction due fracking. Also extraction isn't always bad if you are replacing coal.
4183 2018-04-12 17:09:08 Let's not forget oil.
4184 2018-04-12 17:09:02 i came to get my oil changed and inspection and im jus waiting for them to say my truck is a death trap.
4185 2018-04-12 17:08:59 That's right! It's Canada's oil! Therefore it falls under federal jurisdiction with regards to inter-provincial shipping. The Harper government would have been enforcing the same thing. By the way, Horgan wasn't supported by the majority of voters in the past election.
4186 2018-04-12 17:08:58 Ban based on environmental impact? Have you listen about oil?
4187 2018-04-12 17:08:58 Essar Oil settles $2.5 billion Iran oil dues, still owes about $616 million: NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Essar Oil has settled about 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in dues to Iran to cover previous oil purchases and still owes the country about $616 million, Chief Executive B. Anand…
4188 2018-04-12 17:08:49 @IcelandFoods Well done Iceland for your stance on palm oil. You've got a new customer in me.
4189 2018-04-12 17:08:48 That’s always been how they get out of it....the science is inconclusive. The oil companies knew as early as the late 60s. Shit, Exxon legit raised their platforms to prepare for sea level rise while denying it! That’s big money talking any time you hear that bullshit
4190 2018-04-12 17:08:47 As long as there has been snake oil, there have been people selling it. #innochat
4191 2018-04-12 17:08:31 次回絶対な～
4192 2018-04-12 17:08:21 I once played @JDylanBurke on Madden and he made this terrible Steelers chant that was essentially "STEEL STEEL STEEL" in an aggressive tone. 

I can't think of anything this morning except appropriating that to "OIL OIL OIL"
4193 2018-04-12 17:08:21 Between car repair estimates, oil changes and taxes, I've spent more than enough cash today on being a responsible adult.
4194 2018-04-12 17:08:15 At least when Brian froze the coconut oil, did he make dick-sicles?
4195 2018-04-12 17:08:03 Wanna make a girl fall in love with you? Oil based cologne. You’re welcome. Or try these tips.
4196 2018-04-12 17:07:55  baby oil and highlighter. Omg I'm about to be naked and sparkly all summer long now
4197 2018-04-12 17:07:50 Coolant in my oil. Guess I have no option now but to change that head gasket. 

Good thing I'm able to do this. A shop would charge around $1,000.

4200 2018-04-12 17:07:35 I also wanna try sunflower oil! But right now rose hip oil is my everything
4201 2018-04-12 17:07:35 Nicholson was sold as the savoir of the Oilers, should be the one held responsible. Oilers are a mess, Condors are a mess, & Oil Kings are a mess.
4202 2018-04-12 17:07:28 Try smoking some marijuana.. or some CBD oil.
4203 2018-04-12 17:07:14 Physicians formula argan oil with the shimmer. If you catch the sales at Rite Aid it's buy one get one, or buy one 50% off all the time. I use it
4204 2018-04-12 17:07:06 What do you know about the benefits of CBD Hemp Oil and its health benefits?
4205 2018-04-12 17:06:50 Yeah that's a good point. The girl who posted it also said someone suggested almond oil. Might try that
4206 2018-04-12 17:06:47 Would it be bad form to mention Daesh oil flowing through Israel?
4207 2018-04-12 17:06:37 As long petrol goes down once we take their oil reserves I don’t care #Warmongerer
4208 2018-04-12 17:06:36 can't wait to sit in the heat with my hair wet full of oil conditioner and water absorbing all the sun rays

2 days of crippling anxiety bordering on panic


4214 2018-04-12 17:05:27 2) Russian encroached into Syria and Ukraine's, unchecked. Result: Russia has grabbed up more land, has access to shut off oil to our allies, and now has sea ports into the Mediteranian.  Yes, happened under Obama
4215 2018-04-12 17:05:13 There was an oil spill on the Mississippi River.
4216 2018-04-12 17:05:13 MR PRESIDENT WHEN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE GET THEIR VERDICT THEY WILL GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE RIGHTS TO THE OIL!
4217 2018-04-12 17:05:01 #askZinke Why should I pay extra to see oil wells and pipelines?
4218 2018-04-12 17:05:01 Average gasoline prices this summer are forecasted to be 33 cents per gallon higher than last summer. Higher gasoline prices are due to higher crude oil prices which are rising due to production cuts by OPEC nations.
4219 2018-04-12 17:04:48 Year 6 at Jess Arabian Ranches got their own barrels of Team BOLT engine oil!!! Feel The Speed!

4221 2018-04-12 17:04:32 I’m sure that beauty would be out the window in the face of oil wells! #Hypocrisy #oilandgasslaves
4222 2018-04-12 17:04:22 I think you might be able to find CBD oil from a drug sales rep. But a regular pharmacy doesn’t have it at least not in Mississippi.  @thejtshow
4223 2018-04-12 17:04:18 The mark up on guns, tanks, missles, fighter jets is much better. Everyone does oil too, and we’re world leaders in arms sales. As a country we need to focus on our strengths, like making weapons and starting illegal wars.
4224 2018-04-12 17:04:12 bakit yung rate na nakuha ko sa oil spill ay 8000
4225 2018-04-12 17:04:10 So nuke the whole country, Warmongers! Can't you see atrocities in Myanmar, Gaza, Kashmir? Oh wait, they have no oil. It's not that you care about "human sufferings", destabilizing the middle East is the main objective. Any blind can see the manipulation of the western media.
4226 2018-04-12 17:04:03 The pipeline transports oil to China and the us. Canada is not losing anything... oh but we affecting the indigenous peoples and the environment you swore to protect  #votewasted

4230 2018-04-12 17:03:54 Exactly. My apprenticeship was in an oil refinery. Like going to prison every day with hard labor. 
4231 2018-04-12 17:03:46 Target sells Peanut Butter, don't they? Peanut Oil? Other PB products? And even peanuts? And many Peanut items at the register? Wouldn't these be as much, if not more, of a problem.

4238 2018-04-12 17:03:25 Before oil barrons and tree huggers kill each other please.  It's quite the pickle and I don't envy your position in this.  Please just remember that an imminent 9.0 earthquake and 18 volcanoes are on the table in BC.  So don't forget to add an oil spill to that equation.

4250 2018-04-12 17:02:03 Good response to this alarmist article. A couple of simple comments - 1. palm oil prolly isn't the ideal replacement for trans, but it is an improvement. 2. "Tinned pies" are not "ready to eat" - they have to be cooked - plenty of time to prepare some veg.

4269 2018-04-12 17:00:49 I can help out. First, get the quantity of Egusi you need and add small water, stir, add pepper. When the palm oil is hot, start putting the paste Egusi in it. Gbam, add your onions, salt and Maggi. It will come out well when done.

4277 2018-04-12 17:00:19 Just tried some Linda McCartney veggie sausages for the first time. Absolutely delicious. Would have bought them again - so very disappointed that a check of the ingredients show they have palm oil in them.

4279 2018-04-12 17:00:13 yes, well David Duke disgusts me so emotionally I don't "side" with him but I agree that our leaders have made too many bad judgement calls when it comes to Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. It's really all about oil and not ideology and religion.
4280 2018-04-12 17:00:12 Realistically, the U.S. Elites know that there's no Arab Country that can stand up to Russia and win. The U.S. is the only thing standing in the way of Russia taking, Saudi Arabia's oil, Dubai, Oman etc. Thus, Creating A choke hold on american oil imports and business interest.
4281 2018-04-12 17:00:11 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
4282 2018-04-12 17:00:11 they have always operated like this. before EV was a thing, they aggressively upsold other kinds of snake oil. the entire thing works this way, has always worked this way, and i have been saying this and getting your kind of blustery posturing in response for NEARLY TEN YEARS
4283 2018-04-12 17:00:07 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

4288 2018-04-12 16:59:53 Ran through it like a champ,seen the humongous reptile threw on the cloak,it was freezing cold an damp found a lamp sticking out of the soil,freshly oiled,chucked it at the wall casted fire ball,the oil started to bubble an boil,the Wyvern layed down an its tail went into a coil.

4292 2018-04-12 16:59:42 Bless you hun.i've put all my fatigue and guzzy head downto 'old ladyness' i have the odd nocturnal guiness, a few drops of cbd oil, and some Benenox which helps me sleep loads better. I hope you feelbetter soon xxx
4293 2018-04-12 16:59:39 well, I've seen damage even repeated marijuana use can do on the job-in work like mine (oil) it doesn't belong.  Quite frankly, if you are raising a child on welfare, you don't belong on drugs either.  I see nothing wrong with it.  Accountability is something lacking these days.
4294 2018-04-12 16:59:25 Apparantly eating tons of saturated fat doesn't cause clogged arteries.  My carotid artery scan showed zero plaque.  Bacon, eggs, coconut oil, red meat everyday and no plaque.  So there!
4295 2018-04-12 16:59:17 Peppermint oil actually bangs should’ve used it on my hair ages ago
4296 2018-04-12 16:59:15 It’s all about money , oil, land, etc. It’s always been that way. Ask yourself, who profits.
4297 2018-04-12 16:58:59 I think it’s time for you guys to stop refusing to hear educators and find a way to fund medication in Oklahoma. You have the opportunity to make positive change in the direction of thousands of kids lives by choosing education over oil and gas.

4301 2018-04-12 16:58:07 Why Canada needs so much oil anyway. To export/import?I mean the population is not huge.They can export a lot of other things.If it were for electricity only, just ban ALL crypto money and use the internet for better things. Do you know how much mining&encrypting co$t in energy?!
4302 2018-04-12 16:58:07 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
4303 2018-04-12 16:58:01 Confederation is not something that should jump when a foreign oil company snaps its fingers. Confederation includes the Supreme Court, and First Nations have multiple cases there, and BC's reference case is headed there too. Patience used to be a Canadian virtue.
4304 2018-04-12 16:58:00 Why do my eyes never itch unless my hands are covered in oil..
4305 2018-04-12 16:57:59 If that’s the plan, expect China, India, South Korea and Japan to have something to say, as more than 60% of Iran’s oil goes East.
4306 2018-04-12 16:57:57 that's a lot of stuff. i hydrate my skin with olive oil.

4308 2018-04-12 16:57:53 baby oil > lotion
4309 2018-04-12 16:57:52 Not the same as we need to have an objective and a plan to minimise casualties. We also need a 'new ruler' to maintain order. Remember Iran and Libya and Afghanistan. Are any of them better off after our intervention. This is about oil - pure and simple
4310 2018-04-12 16:57:50 Y’all putting highlighter in your baby oil when you could just buy @DelishCondish and/or @KrazyEssentials...
4311 2018-04-12 16:57:47 No mention of Kuwait. A wealthy oil-rich country with massive oil reserves, buffered by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran. Yet rarely in the news. Holding steady while staying in the shadows.

4316 2018-04-12 16:57:11 Halen We just got out of the shower from this morning's round.
Brian tried something new, he froze some of the coconut oil into cubes....
4317 2018-04-12 16:57:02 It probably won't kill you, but you might need to spray oil on the grass for it to eat every day otherwise it'll get really mad
4318 2018-04-12 16:56:51 Have hope... The USA LLC Military is headed to Syria to save the children from gas attacks. I'm sure universal, free healthcare is right around the corner oil field.
4319 2018-04-12 16:56:48 Anyone keen on burning the midnight oil?

4321 2018-04-12 16:56:35 Some of us at home knew it was about oil and oil only.
4322 2018-04-12 16:56:24 Just one more thing , you are running totally oil and all oil byproducts free are you not ?
4323 2018-04-12 16:56:12 Maybe I should reword it, but wind shouldn't be taxed more than oil and gas and that's effectively trying to advocate for.
4324 2018-04-12 16:56:01 Best Oil Can Boyd reference ever!
4325 2018-04-12 16:55:59 yeah! a little balsamic and olive oil and pepper is my go-to.

4328 2018-04-12 16:55:23 Anyone the think it's odd the Rupert MURDOCH, Fox news GLOBALIST owner, is sitting on the board for the Israeli stolen portion of Syrian land for oil drilling?
Zionists are using americans to fight and die for profit, and the protections of israel. What republic are we again??
4329 2018-04-12 16:55:19 People act like players can automatically mesh, look at the talent on the hawks or oil. On paper they should be in the playoffs, they aren’t.
4330 2018-04-12 16:55:18 Better off with finding a bomb ass highlighter and putting it on or mixing a loose pigment with oil
4331 2018-04-12 16:55:16 If you use almond oil on your skin  and someone whose allergic to nuts touches you, can they have a reaction?
4332 2018-04-12 16:55:16 It's only disappointing if you think accelerating the wealth transfer begun by Ronnie in 1981 from the midldle class to the top 1% is not a desireable goal.  For hedge fund managers and oil mongers, Ryan's been a dream come true.
4333 2018-04-12 16:54:59 Pompeo is putting on the show of his life. He is dangerous the way Dick Cheney is dangerous. He is a huge threat to humanity around the world. Pompeo, Pruitt, Zinke and Bolton take oil over the planet...They will destroy it if we let them.
4334 2018-04-12 16:54:48 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
4335 2018-04-12 16:54:41 Does that include cleaning up the oil slick but they left behind?
4336 2018-04-12 16:54:41 @DaangBiigGuuy Sounds good! Have you taken care of the oil change?
4337 2018-04-12 16:54:31 Don’t you know he has to save Canada? We’re on the edge of not catering to oil interests and Trudeau will make sure that we do. Damn the environment and human rights.

4340 2018-04-12 16:54:24 People in PQ don't want anything from the rest of Canada except HEFTY transfer payments which in a lot of cases come from revenue brought in from the sale of resources such as oil! DUH!

4343 2018-04-12 16:54:08 I like to buy traditional Irish bread like Soda Bread or potato bread, but it is hard to find, even the @chefpaulrankin range is full of disgusting palm oil!  Hardly traditional, healthy or sustainable.  If Iceland can do it then everyone should!  Time to go back to old recipes!
4344 2018-04-12 16:54:05 Not going to bother getting the oil changed in my car.
4345 2018-04-12 16:54:00 Reuters: With oil prices at a 3-year high and global demand growing, OPEC says more upstream investment needed. (Someone, please explain that to the Trudeau government)
4346 2018-04-12 16:53:59 It is the time anyways that oil price it goes to the old price before 2014 ...  up 100/b
4347 2018-04-12 16:53:50 Remember to tell them that it isn't if we get an oil spill but, when and what it will do to our ecosystem.

4359 2018-04-12 16:53:01 Trump's threats to Syria/Russia.  It is OK for the USA to poison it's own people with contaminated water, oil and gas leaks, all in the name of profit, but it is not OK for Syria to do the same, assuming that they are doing it in the first place.
4360 2018-04-12 16:52:58 Everytime I go to class my friends tell me I smell like coconut (My lotion has coconut oil in it) but I wonder if they actually wear lotion because they never really smell like anything specific
4361 2018-04-12 16:52:29 With all the comments it doesn’t appear anyone is buying your snake oil. Perhaps you should try to sell it to another group.

4364 2018-04-12 16:52:23 It does make you think. Norway's top exps are oil, gas+petrol by far+main export dest is the UK. So what good is the EEA for it post brexit?
4365 2018-04-12 16:52:20 Tell that to people on lac megnatic. If oil train crashes everyone is dead
4366 2018-04-12 16:52:14 What they really want, US oil companies, is a partition of Syria, with the top half going to the USA for a pipeline to the Med from Saudi, via Iraq and northern Syria.  So they don't want a knee-jerk reaction.

And they are drilling in Syria. I will just leave that there.......
4372 2018-04-12 16:51:29 and yet no one discusses that Syria has divested from the USD, has no central controlled bank, banned GMO's & is a key piece of real estate for Levaithan oil pipeline which Israel needs. these are key reasons Syria has been attacked & ignored by majority of world

4378 2018-04-12 16:51:06 I just don’t understand what killing million on both sides will accomplish. Maybe it’s me, but war with nuclear bombs seems passé. It’s about money, Internet oil.

4380 2018-04-12 16:51:05 It's also something of a conundrum that they decry science in the realm of climate change yet have great faith in it to develop weapons of war. Perhaps it all boils down to the money oil companies and arms manufacturers can grease their palms with.

4383 2018-04-12 16:51:02 Innovation in the Alberta energy sector is one of the great untold stories. Energi News does it's best, but we don't have the resources to do it justice. AB innovation is one of the reasons I support the oil sands and pipelines.

12 Again I asked him, What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?
 13 He replied, Do you not know what these are?
“No, my lord,” I said.
 14 So he said, These are the two who are anointed to[b] serve the Lord of all the earth
4398 2018-04-12 16:49:57 Why are you not talking about the oil pipelines in Syria. That is 100% why any western interests are in Syria. Everything else is a lie.
4399 2018-04-12 16:49:55 It is a breach of responsibility to support Kinder Morgan, a company in financial distress with a history of law breaking and lying. Instead let's transition our fabulous Canadian workers from the oil patch to renewable energy.

4402 2018-04-12 16:49:36 Did someone say "Oil" in Syria?
4403 2018-04-12 16:49:30 I do not know that oil can qualify as a charm, strictly speaking. However, if your pastor tells you that the oil he's giving u will protect you from law  enforcement, he may be guilty of assisting you in the commission of a crime, as a party to the offence.

4413 2018-04-12 16:48:07 Your lies have been an affront to science, and as lies tend to, have done more damage to the cause of stopping Global Warming, than the oil companies ever could.

4416 2018-04-12 16:47:56 But Hillary wanted to kill everyone for oil. Pompeo wants to kill everyone B/C God told him to. See, it's the zealots insanity not sexism.
4417 2018-04-12 16:47:52 The costs have gone way down. Also how much corporate welfare does the oil industry receive?

4419 2018-04-12 16:47:48 I hate baby oil. Give me an alternative?!?!
4420 2018-04-12 16:47:21 the uk and usa profits with oil and funding but ppl pushing for this are Israel.They want oil pipelines running to israel,then they want those pipelines running to europe. So israel controls the energy and supply to europe. Also they can then expand on syrian land & keep golan

4428 2018-04-12 16:46:41 since you look at it that way, consider the texas oil giant who's interests are at the center of this and ask yourself who is in fact 'tearing apart' Canada
4429 2018-04-12 16:46:23 If I ever have a daughter, we’re gonna wear our bonnets together and do hot oil treatments. Even if I have a son I’m gonna be like, “come here baby. Let me put your wave cap on.” My babies will looooove their hair.

4432 2018-04-12 16:46:02 Is almond oil better for the skin? I know baby oil can cause burning, and I’m fair as helllllll so I will burn strait to hell. 
4433 2018-04-12 16:45:46 This pulls in to get a oil change....2 owners with original 44k miles!
4434 2018-04-12 16:45:46 I did. Have had the key lime oil on mixed fruit before and knew the espresso balsamic was good on strawberries, so I just went for it! #nofear
4435 2018-04-12 16:45:32 Great points - BC has surrendered to the eco-alt-left.  They have a capacity and refining problem - if AB/Saskatchewan shut down or slow down the supple of oil/gas/refined product - the Americans will step up their supply - at an inflated price.  Go big, go green, buy a Tesla.
4436 2018-04-12 16:45:21 So I just have glycerin would that just work or should I put some oil in it too ?
4437 2018-04-12 16:45:17 Oil companies do not "accept" the lie that humans have a material effect on climate change.
But they do bend over and lie in a worthless effort to make the extortionists leave them be.
4438 2018-04-12 16:45:13 S/o to the dude changing my car oil, saw that my spark plug was being wack so he replaced it 
4439 2018-04-12 16:44:58 Says the guy that took $100 million from Al Jazeera.  

BTW - How much of your family wealth came from oil such as Occidental Petroleum Corp?  Did you keep those profits?
4440 2018-04-12 16:44:55 MR PRESIDENT WARS ARE FOUGHT FOR EITHER HATRED; INJUSTICE ;OR WEALTH SUCH AS GOLD OR OIL !WHY DOES ASSAD FIGHT ? WHAT HAS HE TO GAIN IN DESTRUCTION OF SYRIA MOST OF THE PEOPLE GONE????
4441 2018-04-12 16:44:42 Lmaoooo time now I was just about to buy my oil and bronzer to make my knock off version
4442 2018-04-12 16:44:40 I went a couple weeks ago for an oil change and they found one thing wrong that probably would pay for your 47 things. Lol

4445 2018-04-12 16:44:18 White Castle will be offering a new version of it’s famous slider—made from Impossible Food’s plant-based burger product. The Impossible burger is made from wheat, coconut oil, potatoes, and heme, an iron-containing compound the company extracts from plants.
4446 2018-04-12 16:44:12 The oil ?
4447 2018-04-12 16:44:10 I love that foundation  coverage, finish, and oil control A1

4450 2018-04-12 16:43:52 Egypt: GASC bought 27000 t of soya oil and 22500 t of sunflower oil
4451 2018-04-12 16:43:50 So basically, their target market is for peeps trying to (become vegetarian/can't eat meat/nutrition issues with meat) and like their burgers medium or below? I wouldn't eat bloody real meat.  So I can't imagine trying this simply because it's made of coconut oil and heme(?).
4452 2018-04-12 16:43:50 @RachelNotley @jjhorgan FINALLY! Limit the oil being delivered to #BC #boycottbc what's taking so long?
4453 2018-04-12 16:43:47 I’ve never seen such a lack of teamwork. @okgop I wish you would choose team Oklahoma and not team big oil.
4454 2018-04-12 16:43:43 And that logically would make it Canada's oil not Alberta's?
4455 2018-04-12 16:43:41 Thank you for apologizing Ari.
I had fun exchanging with you.
Countries/companies/foundations don't divest because they make so much from oil.
They're divesting because carbon emissions from fossil fuels are creating a climate catastrophe that we can't adapt to.
4456 2018-04-12 16:43:39 isse bhi jada tagda punishment milni chahiye, boiled oil dal kar.
4457 2018-04-12 16:43:35 Why should they die an easy death? They made the innocent one suffer to the point of death. Deliberately, lustfully. Skin them to death or break every single bone in their body or throw them in boiling oil. Make them suffer, that would be justice! #IndiaWithAsifa
4458 2018-04-12 16:43:34 @ArmineYalnizyan money in oil and live off the interest in a sovereign fund I know a few weeks ago there was a story about this related to Texas setting a fund up in the @dallasnews reporting

4475 2018-04-12 16:42:32 YA. but i legit bought snake oil on amazon because of the podcast. and i just want to force all my friends to play it with me.
4476 2018-04-12 16:42:13 All you need for body lava is glitter and baby oil! I refuse to pay $60 sorry boo
4477 2018-04-12 16:42:12 Is it terrible on both sides? Which side of the road is the oil spill? To or from the CBD?
4478 2018-04-12 16:42:11 Ja! Ich bin OIL KING !
4479 2018-04-12 16:42:06 “High tech Canadian oil” 
4480 2018-04-12 16:42:04 We are worried about oceans too.  Ship traffic will increase dramatically significantly increasing chances of oil spills / collisions.
4481 2018-04-12 16:42:02 That is for sure. Hannity is a snake oil con man like the con man that he worships. He makes a Dam Fool out of himself every nite!!! I don't know how this idiot landed a job on TV.
4482 2018-04-12 16:41:56 What part of creating ISIS and Al-Qaeda has kept us safe,they fought for oil rights and nothing more.
4483 2018-04-12 16:41:43 โอ๊ย ขอกรี๊ดดดดด  เรื่องนี้ที่รอคอยยย ชอบพลอตมาก เจ้าน้อย เมธิส Pls, come back
4484 2018-04-12 16:41:36 The oil companies are still trying to figure out, how to build a Tesla like car and run it on petrol. In short: sometimes you product (Siri) is so broken/defective, it can't be fixed.
4485 2018-04-12 16:41:21 Gotta get an oil change today. In order to do that, gotta leave the house. See my dilemma?
4486 2018-04-12 16:41:18 Risk penalty is trivial?? Then why is a part of the bill?  I’d argue that if oil gets to $75-80/brl, the risk penalty is not trivial.
4487 2018-04-12 16:41:10 The flavoring is usually wheat flour, palm oil, rice vinegar, which one follows these instructions correctly, one of boiling
4488 2018-04-12 16:41:08 " Snake oil". That's rich coming from an Natonalist.  
4489 2018-04-12 16:40:59 そうはいかんぞ！！！あげません！！
4490 2018-04-12 16:40:53 Right. I already have the Fenty highlighter “Trophy Wife”. I barely use it. I can easily scrape some of it into a travel bottle filled with almond oil and make a shimmery oil. I was going to buy the real body lava, but I know I would barely use it.
4491 2018-04-12 16:40:44 Looks like baby oil to me

4493 2018-04-12 16:40:42 See Sanjay Gupta CNN episodes "weed", Charlotte's web strain & Rick Simpson Oil.  Hemp oil, hemp derived Cbd oil & full spectrum cannabis cbd oil are all different.
4494 2018-04-12 16:40:32 How is the continued use, promotion and development of oil & oil based products safe for our earth’s future and future generations?
4495 2018-04-12 16:40:25 Also this is not in the best interests of Canada. Green energy is. How many oil spills happened last year? Why do we have to suffer?
4496 2018-04-12 16:40:24 うへへ…ください…
4497 2018-04-12 16:40:14 @ArmineYalnizyan I said something that I shouldn’t have about your comment on the decline of oil categorizing Canadians as ignorant which is the farthest from the truth besides my grandpa was Canadian 
The countries you mentioned could be doing that because they made so much

4499 2018-04-12 16:40:08 What is perfume oil?
4500 2018-04-12 16:39:52 Al-Qaeda,ISIS etc only exist because of the fake wars we've fought in the middle east(for oil) they are not fighting to keep us safe,in fact we are less safe because of atrocities our government have perpetrated.
4501 2018-04-12 16:39:51 @TaraNWeber Imagine..the people of BC realizing that they still need oil and if the flow slows prices will skyrocket and there will be shortages..lol.
4502 2018-04-12 16:39:50 I beg to differ. This cannot apply with those who have MDD and other mental illnesses.

4506 2018-04-12 16:39:30 正直でよろしいと思います
4507 2018-04-12 16:39:27 Many problems with this story. GDP growth rate doesn’t track oil output always. It’s obvious that a decline in output in any key sector would push down growth. Doesn’t mean that sector drives growth
4508 2018-04-12 16:39:02 An oil cleanser that I mix together. Castor oil, a couple drops of tea tree oil, & almond oilI,  Dr. Bronners Castile soap (rose) if I have makeup or sweat a lot at the gym under cold water, then I use a rose toner and moisturizer. Usually almond oil.

4510 2018-04-12 16:38:59 I agree, the Nolan fiasco is on them. Plus they let dropping oil prices determine who to sign
4511 2018-04-12 16:38:49 Falih is impeccable he is adressing the capex hole - basically this means they target a return to 100 dollar oil to justify traditional plays and deep water
4512 2018-04-12 16:38:49 You are dancing to the tune of Oil Companies, big cooperations and special interests. Environmental safety has never been their concern. History should remember you as a man who stood his ground for the good of all #Canadians not just a few millionaires.
4513 2018-04-12 16:38:42 "SNP HAVE NO CHANCE GETTING IN EUROPE AS SPAIN WILL VETO THEM"
We'll join EFTA, then. In Norwegian, Icelandic and Scottish waters there are about 4m tonnes of fish caught every year (the entire EU currently lands 5m). And a near monopoly on North Sea oil. And still be part of CM
4514 2018-04-12 16:38:31 I need undisputable proof before i could support this. Why would Assad chance total destruction or asassination?  How about the several tribes fighting that hate each other & Assad? Then there’s isis & Genie Oil! I don’t trust anybody neither should you

4524 2018-04-12 16:37:35 A fine stain of organic Cannabis (THC-CBD balance matters), mildly heat-extracted in olive oil. In a dropper bottle like tinctures come in. Really helps immensely, 20-30 min before closing eyes. Sleep longer and deeper. Homemade is fine.
4525 2018-04-12 16:37:32 I can’t say im surprised oil isn’t popping for a second straight day due to the supply glut but we’re easily on the cusp of $70 barrel crude
4526 2018-04-12 16:37:30 Oil spillage on Mombasa Road
4527 2018-04-12 16:37:28 I’m sorry Mr. Prime Minister but your word carries little weight with me, Oil Spill cleanup is considered a success if they are able to recapture 10-15% of what’s spilled, that’s not good enough, and Kinder Morgan’s track record speaks for itself
4528 2018-04-12 16:37:18 どっちも好きだから仕方ないね？？
4529 2018-04-12 16:36:56 I’d prefer crane operators who didn’t smoke weed due to a back injury

No doubt you would prefer the guy on the oil change rack wasn’t taking Vicodin either 

“ why is the oil light on honey?”

Oops they didn’t put any oil back in!

4533 2018-04-12 16:36:29 How will this reduce global emissions AT ALL? Oil is produced to meet growing demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS, like we have). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead
4534 2018-04-12 16:36:28 how? Indigenous people's rights and court cases being ignored so that a #Texas oil company can get their private project to markets in #China
4535 2018-04-12 16:36:27 Where are the oil producing nations? Saudi, Nigeria, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela. Those are who we should be comparing to. Oh yea... they don’t share info

4539 2018-04-12 16:36:00 BC can do as it pleases...only BC & Ont refine less gas than they actually use...no matter where else they get it, it costs more & has to come in by train or tanker, both of which are less safe than pipeline.

BC consumes 140 million barrels of oil/yr...lots of tankers & trains.

4543 2018-04-12 16:35:42 I work in the oil industry. From where I sit the position of oil companies on Climate Change are always suspect for several reasons.
1) Deny Climate Change & get hammered by MSM, Climate Change “experts” & progressive government —>  
2) Go along for some crony capitalism

4561 2018-04-12 16:33:40 we have to stop using oil...full stop.
4562 2018-04-12 16:33:37 Hahaha kakehan bumbu dan gorengnya pake olive oil. Anak kosan mah pake sajiku sama minyak jelantah wis ngene ""
4563 2018-04-12 16:33:35 But there has been positives before the oil price started rising.

4565 2018-04-12 16:33:23 What do you think causes the foolish virgins to have insufficient oil?
4566 2018-04-12 16:33:21 wow yall are just learning how to make your own body shimmers/ illuminators. diy with a toner like witch hazel, almond oil/baby oil + any highlight
4567 2018-04-12 16:33:21 how pregnant? so pregnant i forgot to wash the top of my head while shampooing this morning and am now sporting an oil patch amidst clean hair.
4568 2018-04-12 16:33:17 Ah ok that explains it, screen-shottijg some random blokes conspiratorial ramblings about oil pipelines across the Middle East has certainly convinced me. Thank you.
4569 2018-04-12 16:33:16 I think FED is finally normalising rates, catching up as they were way behind the curve,trying to cool down equity "inflation".

The huge US$ move from 80-100 mid 2014 was a combo of oil collapse,ECB QE hint, BOJ QQE add and FED taper...and overdone given Inflation differentials
4570 2018-04-12 16:33:09 Bloomin’ eck, how much palm oil are you drinking man? Would hope that most will subsist on solid foods & just use oil to stop it sticking to the pan...

4573 2018-04-12 16:32:53 Well hell, more dependent upon oil than ever, and no one knows what price of oil will be in three months,  much less three years.   Silly.
4574 2018-04-12 16:32:49 性別とかいう概念、邪魔だなぁって思うことはよくある
4575 2018-04-12 16:32:44 Oil is produced to meet growing demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as carbon pricing). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead. Bad deal for the economy and global environment.
4576 2018-04-12 16:32:42 You can advocate without using oil products.
"Have to live" and "using oil and electricity to express opinions" is a laughable comparison. 

Stop while you are behind.

4580 2018-04-12 16:32:23 Are you curious about the benefits of CBD oil?
4581 2018-04-12 16:32:21 I'm sorry but this just is the best image ever. You getting ready to battle all the woodland creatures in the name of duckies.

4584 2018-04-12 16:32:06 It is certainly going to allow the Chinese to get a huge boost in developing and selling EVs while the US remains locked up by oil companies and embroiled in the middle East!
4585 2018-04-12 16:32:02 I agree with you there and president was am oil man after all.
4586 2018-04-12 16:32:00 Russia bribing them with oil and natural gas most likely. Also, a significant portion of her population is from there.
4587 2018-04-12 16:31:59 Just took some oil that has Cannabis in it ??? My Mam had it in her press so why not.  Anything to get me through the day
4588 2018-04-12 16:31:55 In the mid-90s, the KCBT tried to launch a western natural gas contract. It was dead from the beginning. We've already seen enough from the CNY oil contract to know that it will continue to thrive.

4591 2018-04-12 16:31:25 And someones try to invade Middle East countries in order to fill their 5000cc jeeps oil tanks free of charge instead of spending war tool's mpney to humanity.

4594 2018-04-12 16:31:06 Dr. Manmohan singh bcoz we r paying around  Rs. 50/litre now we r paying more than Rs.80/litre.. crued oil rates reduced many times but govt. not given reduced rate of petrol compare to reduction and not even reduced taxes of central and state govt.,
Also same with  the fuel gas,
4595 2018-04-12 16:31:06 What character? Snake Oil salesmen?

4598 2018-04-12 16:30:38 The IRS won't let you take the standard milage deduction for two-wheeled vehicles. If you keep records you can claim actual expenses (gas,oil,tires) for your work trips. I would assume corporate rules mirror the IRS. But TRIPS credits should work.
4599 2018-04-12 16:30:30 Men need feminism like a fish needs a bicycle.
4600 2018-04-12 16:30:30 Y’all gone burn tf up this summer with that baby oil/highlighter combo.
4601 2018-04-12 16:30:30 Yeah and there’s more actual mustard and egg yolk content in European mayo. I can always tell how a mayo is mostly just vegetable oil by how long the shelf date is 
4602 2018-04-12 16:30:29 i agree -- recently the weakness has been on the export side

think us share of cap goods has been pushed up by intensity of oil and gas investment.  capital goods for the oil sector remains a US competitive strength

4604 2018-04-12 16:30:27 What's a good oil that isn't too oily or greasy ): I don't want to feel wet lmao
4605 2018-04-12 16:30:27 black ice is a phenomenon that occurs during pop up showers in a time of high heat,  displacing oil in road causing a patch of road that [behaves] like ice.
Or, a term used for transparent ice to absolve oneself from responsibility.
4606 2018-04-12 16:30:26 Now if you have wisdom find the answer why petrol is so high. You have been deprived of low price of petrol. This is a loot only. Let oil price reach to 80. This incompetent Govt can not handle the situation.
4607 2018-04-12 16:30:21 ゴールは見えてるから頑張れる！ありがとです
4608 2018-04-12 16:30:07 According to the #E3ME model baseline, NZ contributes only 0.007% of global oil supply in 2050. Removing it won't have big impact at global level, but v interesting how quickly supply-side decarb policies have risen up the agenda. @ryanrafaty
4609 2018-04-12 16:30:05 Often wondered that myself, is it really the oil or is it something else..... Religion?
4610 2018-04-12 16:30:01 cheap highlighter (one that's pigmented I suggest the Ruby Kisses ones), a mix of oil (not coconut), I'd add rose water and mango butter oil for scent, and some whipped butter for texture. boom. probably better for you too.

I respect the environment as a rancher of 7k acres I just don’t think oil is over
4620 2018-04-12 16:28:51 Yikes, I use coconut oil to moisturize in the summer 
4621 2018-04-12 16:28:51 Yes that’s true because using baby oil in the sun can cause serious issues 
4622 2018-04-12 16:28:45 I printed something and my boss grabbed it and got oil stains on it. Am I petty and wasteful if I print another one bc I don’t want my paper to have oil stains on it

4624 2018-04-12 16:28:34 Clovis essential oil really helps use a q-tip w some water and rub it on your gum/tooth. But try your hardest to not get it on your tongue. You can find it at new earth market. Sounds crazy but hella takes away the pain!

Kumba-Ekombe road as well as all arteries leading into Ndian division seems blocked allegedly by Unspecified armed groups. I also gathered, Oil tankers transporting oil palm from Pamol are blocked & others reportedly burst, leading spillage
4630 2018-04-12 16:28:11 I’m sick of all these oil powered teams. Maybe one day all teams can run on renewable energy.
4631 2018-04-12 16:28:09 There is something about the middle east. It’s been the driving force behind world politics for 5000 years, and it continue to be till today. I hope someone would discover the secret behind that area importance, of course other than oil that was only found recently.
4632 2018-04-12 16:27:48 Drove that Toyota to work today. Taking 'er in for an oil change at 1:30.

4635 2018-04-12 16:27:42 To quote a former CIO of Shell Oil at a CIO presentation years ago: "Beware of pipefitters with Computer Science degrees."
4636 2018-04-12 16:27:42 Using oil companies' opinion as a premise in scientific derivation is a fallacy; their opinion is formed on earlier premise of obtaining profit in any given circumstances, and not on obtaining the truth of the matter. They have to work within any legislative environment.
4637 2018-04-12 16:27:26 they had the mission to cover and secure the oil / gas fields over there AFTER a deal - but that deal was a fraud - some "SDF" disguised as ISIS showed up - both opened fire - then hell broke lose and the group got wiped out.
4638 2018-04-12 16:27:25 also bush had Rockefeller backing since 1901 lol, they are the kings of Oil and wanted to monopolize. so who opposed the Rockefeller's? Muslim owned oil fields! or as they say Islamic State owned oil fields lol its such a joke. we started terrorism

4644 2018-04-12 16:26:58 2. China, despite not paying the true cost of oil (WAR) is aggressively pursuing the displacement of the US dollar as the worlds oil/reserve currency. China is attempting to insert its gold backed yuan in place of the US dollar It's easy to buy gold when your not paying for war
4645 2018-04-12 16:26:55 Humph, its called piece by piece little by little strategy then go for Russian wealth again they have Saudi, Sth Africa, Australia, Canada Iraq, most of Libya's wealth oil gold diamonds etc "Total Dominion"Political-Legal Educational nip them in the eye.

4647 2018-04-12 16:26:48 Depends on the day, really. Showering every day would strip my skin and hair of too much oil, so i shower once every 3-4 days and if it happens to land on a work day, it's night, but if it's on an off day, it's usually day.

4684 2018-04-12 16:23:29 Well let's start with a few simple issues. 1. Free Riding, As you know China enjoys the worlds Free Flow of oil without paying its true cost (WAR). By some estimates the US had paid with countless lives lost and $4 trillion dollars and climbing.
4685 2018-04-12 16:23:27 Feck knows! I think they’re under the ancient illusion that all nurses work in a healthcare facility and nurses aren’t employed in other industries like oil rigs, sports and music events, prisons and even people’s own homes... honestly it’s drives me nuts!

4688 2018-04-12 16:23:02 So sorry Justin you have to go out of your way to stop Horgan from forcing oil on Trains rather than a 900% safer pipeline.
4689 2018-04-12 16:22:56 To be fair, you are dead right Ari, the oil industry is totally NOT over. 
Investors are hustling to make as much money as possible before the party's over and the planet is on fire and the seas rise/fail to support life. 
So knock yourself out.
You win.
Wish us ignoramuses well.

4704 2018-04-12 16:21:33 I showed my hubs @Oil_Guns_Merica 's gofundme. He said if he had a few extra bucks, he'd donate just because the pic & idea behind it made him laugh.
4705 2018-04-12 16:21:29 I like your way better.

4710 2018-04-12 16:21:07 And yet you anticipate more refugees I'm sure?  And from what you say, its NOT about protecting the people at all its about....? What, the oil pipelines? Unseating a leader that US/UK don't like? And connected to Brexit how? Preparing weapons trade deals? You have info to share?
4711 2018-04-12 16:21:04 I need a nigga so he can take my car to get a oil change n shi cause I hate going.
4712 2018-04-12 16:21:01 Well that was where they used to play until oil money

4720 2018-04-12 16:20:06 Horgan, there are many foreign oil tankers going up and down the BC coast to get somewhere and I don't mean coming to Canada.  So don't use the weak excuse since many other countries transport oil and don't have strict controls like Canada! Don't be a hypocrite!
4721 2018-04-12 16:20:04 Oil Sheen the olive oil kind.
4722 2018-04-12 16:19:58 There is no way all that oil isn’t coming out for a reason. How come the turbo oil isn’t included in the oil use limit?
4723 2018-04-12 16:19:49 Canadians shouldn't be left holding the tab while the corporate investors flee or get skittish of the oil sands prospects being out shined by the shale gas/ fracking boom that makes easier oil plays in this over supplied domestic/ global markets.
4724 2018-04-12 16:19:44 I'm not one of them for the record. But the general consensus is to make us believe that the policies of this government and the doggedness of Kemi is dragging us out, forgetting that all these are coinciding with the highest oil prices since they came to power.
4725 2018-04-12 16:19:43 I gotta Ac too..you must be paying for synthetic oil changes not conventional cuz I pay around that price too
4726 2018-04-12 16:19:41 Obama also did the important work of destroying ISIS’ economy by bombing the oil fields they’d seized and the truck convoys they shipped it with. ISIS has had to steadily decrease fighters’ pay, which led to defections. Between that, Mosul, Ramadi... Obama did the hard work lol

4728 2018-04-12 16:19:38 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
4729 2018-04-12 16:19:33 It's so crazy how people mix business with personal 24/7. That shit should be like oil and water
4730 2018-04-12 16:19:32 I am shocked by these reply’s to a fair response to
@ArmineYalnizyan bad comment that the oil industry is over which is baseless from any information I have ever seen on @CNBCFastMoney
4731 2018-04-12 16:19:27 Wow he wants control of Canadian oil too? Can’t let this happen! Not a good deal!
4732 2018-04-12 16:19:25 I wish I didn’t have to put literal oil on under my eyes so that my makeup won’t make me look like damn viejita

4737 2018-04-12 16:19:10 Maybe you can go visit some oil fields...
4738 2018-04-12 16:19:07 Get on with the pipelines west and east. Make our own country money. Stop buying foreign oil and supporting countries who support terrorism and honor killings.  Support Canada. Give Canadians work.

4748 2018-04-12 16:18:18 Suggesting that you support "phasing out oil", while using electricity, and a product made with oil, to simply read and express opinions, is hypocrisy.
4749 2018-04-12 16:18:14 Adding to the oil glut once again killing jobs in many other countries as a result.
4750 2018-04-12 16:18:09 Thank you for approvals; now the infrastructure.

4756 2018-04-12 16:17:49 There’s no oil there 
4757 2018-04-12 16:17:38 If these cases are successful the winners need to be careful that the oil companies don't repeat the tobacco trick of turning the payments into bonds which pay out based on future tobacco consumption.

Tobacco companies saved billions with this trick.

4760 2018-04-12 16:17:12 All fascinating info at today’s #ACBACLE on the evolving role of municipalities in oil and gas drilling
4761 2018-04-12 16:17:10 Again no public funds since this is a corporate bailout disguised as a public good. It's a bad deal for Canadian's since the CAPEX of a 30yr outlay project certainly has several loss leading years due to the incoming market shocks of global economies divesting from oil.
4762 2018-04-12 16:17:03 Saudis will have ordered her to go in, they run the UK now for oil rewards, we need more oil no than ever, UK should have been the first country to use free electric energy to benefit our islands, but it doesnt benefit the elites.
4763 2018-04-12 16:17:01 Sure, let’s break up the country. We’ll take the vast majority of GDP with us, and the dumb fuck Trump cultists can huddle around an oil well in Texas for warmth.

4769 2018-04-12 16:16:42 Wilson has reproved Eck for basing the Waste Paper on oil revenues. Not an error he has made in his report (I hear).

4784 2018-04-12 16:15:59 As this CBD oil craze gains strength, it would be nice to see some real research approved to determine its effectiveness. Research is very sparse. Some studies suggest effectiveness in treating epileptic seizures, but nearly all other claims of its benefit are purely anecdotal.

4786 2018-04-12 16:15:55 Oil Prices edged off highs last reached in late 2014 due to rising U.S. stocks but remained well supported by shrinking global oil inventories and expectations of a supply cut extension by OPEC.
4787 2018-04-12 16:15:43 So ask yourself, is it really the oil outsiders want to stop , perhaps not . The ability to gain access to growing global markets with high volume safe pipelines which would be a win /win for all , so who is stopping Canada from going global in a global word trade ?#buildkm

If I am wrong why has texas increased oil rig development and production?
I guess you don’t like the real truth
4804 2018-04-12 16:14:09 Bioré & coconut oil do so much justice to my face
4805 2018-04-12 16:14:06 Archbishop Welby was an oil executive in charge of UK’s Enterprise Oil plc West Africa concerns btw 1984 & 89. He only left his post in 1989 saying he had a “calling” & was ordained a C.O.E  priest in 1993. Connect the dots if u smell a rat.

4810 2018-04-12 16:13:51 It doesn’t say no oil though...there’s a pink one a bit cheaper that says no oil...but if this is the one you were talking about I’m on it 
4811 2018-04-12 16:13:47 That is the Escondida copper mine in Chile. It has nothing to do with batteries. Although I have to say that if the NDP is going to be against oil supply then they should help lower the demand for it, the budget, however, offered nothing new for EVs.

4814 2018-04-12 16:13:42 Lol. Who’s giving applause to Kemi?

Rising crude oil prices dragged us out of the recession. At the time almost every other sector of the economy was experiencing negative growth. Things are slowly improving, yes, but $30 oil will drag us right back into the mud.
4815 2018-04-12 16:13:34 yeah, not a fan and just doing quick market research, it's really just refined coconut oil and beet juice.

4824 2018-04-12 16:12:55 Okay NDP voters take a look in the mirror today and ask, "is this way we voted for".  All we are doing is fighting to move oil transportation from train cars to a pipeline.
4825 2018-04-12 16:12:50 I agree. Most equity PMs don’t look at macro in detail (it’s difficult and time intensive) and thus end up being reactionary to underlying Oil price. Will only buy Energy Cos once price is confirmed
4826 2018-04-12 16:12:42 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?

4834 2018-04-12 16:11:53 This may be the unhappy result of having an empty vessel as PM surrounded by the former head of a major environmental  group personally on record for keeping oil sands in the ground and a haughty MOE more comfy lecturing than listening.

4836 2018-04-12 16:11:45 viii. This is to boast agricultural production and non oil exports in the face of unpredictable crude oil prices and its resultant effects on the revenue profile of Nigeria. #AHIFood
4837 2018-04-12 16:11:45 My main questions for @MBuhari is since you've been elected what jobs have you created in Nigeria, why are our people still not seeing the benefits of the oil industry, why do you still allow the military to pollute the environment by dumping oil in the the rivers? #Nigeria
4838 2018-04-12 16:11:41 Please remember the gas boycott on April 15th. Fill your tank the 14th or 16th, if everyone were to boycott it would take 3 BILLION dollars away from oil companies and lower gas prices overnight

4873 2018-04-12 16:09:12 every other week, brush cleanser and olive oil (to condition them). I've washed my brushes for years like this, every brand you can think of, so it's definitely not that lol
4874 2018-04-12 16:09:07 It’s all good. I’m surprised streamer would debate needing numbers even shallow ones. The whole thing is numbers. 3 constant. 50 followers. Time and hours. Every bit helps. You don’t turn down an oil change because you only work on transmissions. It how you make money.
4875 2018-04-12 16:08:55 Investor mentality. Current status quo is still “lower for longer” in Oil prices. Energy cos won’t play catch up until that mentality changes, and usually once Oil is much much higher.
4876 2018-04-12 16:08:48 Continued flow of oil revenue from the Niger-Delta into the pockets of their feudal establishment while their masses remain in grinding poverty, ensuring they remain malleable as fodder for political intrigues. 

That's the plan.

4906 2018-04-12 16:06:25 Explain how Assad is not resisting western imperialism. His presence as head of the state in Syria alone is preventing the oil pipeline the US and Turkey have been pushing for.
4907 2018-04-12 16:06:02 There’s this weird school of thought among the media that they can trick right wingers into taking GOP/P Ryan/Trump political gloss as substantive limitations on what they’re actually doing. Never works, never stops.

4925 2018-04-12 16:04:37 No secret. Instead of using butter to grill up the bread, use mayo. The oil and egg in the mayo gives a light crispy crunch. So good. Been doing it since the 90s.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her government “has a plan to transition towards a carbon-neutral future, one that looks 30 years in advance”
4935 2018-04-12 16:04:04 The problem is that BC has real concerns with potential destruction of their pristine coastline and wildlife by oil spills and increased tanker traffic.  Perhaps someone could explain why Alberta can’t use existing pipelines to get their oil to refineries in the U.S.?
4936 2018-04-12 16:03:59 As much as possible, the Oil companies try to remove the metals and sulfur from the bitumen. What is in the tailings ponds is what was removed from the bitumen so that it can be sold to a refiner. The volatilizes will evaporate from the ponds and then they can be mined.

4942 2018-04-12 16:03:38 That makes sense. Also, bonus QI klaxon for mention of "oil" "western imperialism" and fatuous comparisons to Iraq.
4943 2018-04-12 16:03:35 Am I missing something you know @daveydimwit? I’ve been in the patch since 1985 and every oil company that has had a line leak has been responsible and cleaned it and reclaimed the land. As a result, the farming goes on like nothing happened and wildlife continues to prosper.

4950 2018-04-12 16:02:40 I'll bring the oil and muscle.
4951 2018-04-12 16:02:39 Uggg... Really getting tired of @jiffylube pestering me for other services when I am there for an oil change... Ask the question once, then leave it alone... Not two, three, four times on same visit....
4952 2018-04-12 16:02:27 Why would you want to end O-Zone regulations? This is how you know the Republicans do not care about the environment & only have interests in money backed by the coal & oil industries.
4953 2018-04-12 16:02:25 I was driving and the oil light on my car came on
4954 2018-04-12 16:02:20 Your opinion. 
But your original comment was that this oil was "destined for export". Which was somehow bad, and a good reason to stop the pipeline.

Try to stay consistent.
4955 2018-04-12 16:02:06 also before u bleach cover ur hair in coconut oil it saves it sooooo much

4988 2018-04-12 15:59:16 Trump created enough confusion. Mattis is walking the whole thing back. As I said, it's a nothing burger, but oil prices, ruble, and Russian stock market are up. So far, both Russian and US benefit from this Ghouta hoax crisis.

If we are in a war, I don’t want to depend on the Middle East for reserves, IMHO a bad idea.Machines of war require oil, homes, SUVs do not.U are 4 wasting our reserv, while ruining groundwater

Now after our interventions in Iraq Afghanistan and Libya turned out so well for them I can see his point
5021 2018-04-12 15:56:27 What about the WTI oil price?
5022 2018-04-12 15:56:24 Not anytime soon. More because of growing Iranian / Saudi empowerment of other parts of the population that don’t necessarily ascribe to the olive oil and Phoenician wine culture.
5023 2018-04-12 15:56:21 You're really quick! I have to think on that for a while. Have you read Island by Huxley? It centers around that theme - a sort of Tantric Buddhist left-wing society called Pala struggling to maintain its identity when oil is discovered there.

5032 2018-04-12 15:55:10 Exactly! Texas is doing well because you have a commodity that everyone wants to purchase. It’s not conservative fiscal policy that enriches you, IT’S THE OIL. If Kansas had it, they’d be flush.

5039 2018-04-12 15:54:33 Our military under Trump is about defense - not offense.  We don't want their oil - they'll need it to rebuild.  We don't want to convert them to democracy - they are Muslim.  We don't want to expand our control - we are nationalists not globalists. It's their county not ours.
5040 2018-04-12 15:54:16 Watch for large investments just before the bombing of Syria starts. The obvious targets would be options in oil stocks and now Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies.

We are tired of foreign funded groups spreading lies, with the only intent being to help their oil industries.

5060 2018-04-12 15:52:23 Weaver's comments on BNN today show a profound misconception re the SPEED of any transition away from oil. It will take decades, but Weaver insists it's happening NOW. The truth? Global oil demand has never been higher. Up 1.5 m barrels a day this yr to > 99 m b's a day, per IEA.

5065 2018-04-12 15:51:46 They’ve been clueing this for months.  It’s the best PR statement going for high oil prices on the market and an excuse not to produce more which they cannot.
5066 2018-04-12 15:51:38 Chi, How high do you think oil will go if Trump hit Syria?
5067 2018-04-12 15:51:36 We will set that oil on fire before you take over the world! We know how, don’t forget that!

5070 2018-04-12 15:51:20 Assad was winning the fight against the rebels and was in control. After Trump said "US will withdraw fromSyria" rebels on the run, panicked & played dirty to get the world involved It's about oil. Saudi, Israel, Genie oil, Cheney, Murdoch all want Assad out

5073 2018-04-12 15:50:47 It will have no noticeable impact. It has oil production now. It will save burning energy to ship it in from.thiusands of miles away.
5074 2018-04-12 15:50:47 Or just oil the lanes to where the outside part of the lane is in play. Then no one would have to loft it
5075 2018-04-12 15:50:43 The discussion was around *how* data is deleted in distributed systems, not whether Facebook does, doesn’t or should.
5076 2018-04-12 15:50:37 My view may be controversial but I firmly believe that Salisbury and the Syrian chemical attack are False Flags . An excuse is being sought to create this issue . Maybe oil maybe in contention with Russia or to boost flagging poll ratings .
All these reasons are pure evil !

5084 2018-04-12 15:50:14 Oil was our major source of livelihood under OBJ. You said earlier that us running a mono economy caused the recession when oil price fell. Why weren't we in a recession when oil price was even lower than that of the recession of 2016, in 1999-2003?

5086 2018-04-12 15:49:41 But be ready to resist all the usual neocon tropes. Powell was not so much ever a real socialist, as a self advantaging snake oil merchant who used any aspect of political allegiance to advance himself. Much like Hitler.
5087 2018-04-12 15:49:35 That means, "we have already sold, now you should too". BTW, what's your price target on SLV? PMs ready to break out soon? And, any thoughts on the oil breakout? Perhaps that's the catalyst to get that last leg down in the USD. Oil is exceeding your price target.
5088 2018-04-12 15:49:27 Oil has doubled over the last 15 years, so makes sense in a way
5089 2018-04-12 15:49:26 We should recognize that we are entering the global energy landscape at a time of great upheaval, amid falling oil prices, demands for clean, renewable energy and talk of carbon taxes and electric cars.

5112 2018-04-12 15:48:01 India & Pakistan would fight even if they lived in an glass bowl. Iran & Iraq/Saudi have a religious basis for intense rivalry. Qatar is sympathetic to Iran & that causes conflict with other Arab nations. Nothing to do with oil. Learn your history.
5113 2018-04-12 15:47:58 So the baby oil/highlighter trick has to have a different oil involved.. I want my skin to glow not bake honey..  
5114 2018-04-12 15:47:50 Tax cuts are doing a number on Oklahoma as well. I think Indiana has experienced some trouble, too. And with Texas also so very reliant on the oil/gas/energy sector, we have to be careful or we can find ourselves in trouble, too.

5128 2018-04-12 15:46:57 I don't believe so. I had Found references to the derailments in Huffington Post, Globe & Mail, CTV and even CBC. the one with oil cars entering the river was apparently near Gogema Ontario. That's as far as I followed it, so admittingly it COULD be fake, but I did check on it
5129 2018-04-12 15:46:51 Do not forget to add that the economy did not take a hit in OBJ's tenure, oil prices did not crash even though it was low and there was no global crisis neither did he build the reserves in one or two years.
When we compare, fairness is to compare ALL indices.

5140 2018-04-12 15:46:16 The term elite implies some intelligence in the life forms. The way these ones plunder, cannibalize each other then about-turn blow hot air up each others arses implies the opposite. in which life is operating an airline inefficiently with no oil resources, a smart thing to do?
5141 2018-04-12 15:46:15 I remember that one summer i applied baby oil on my entire body I walked out the house a Hershey kiss chocolate bar, I came back a dark chocolate twix. Smh 
5142 2018-04-12 15:46:15 Because, they're replacing the existing 45-year-old, 40-km pipeline that is supplemented by about 1,000 tanker truck deliveries each month from Washington State. with a new 13-kilometre underground pipeline to YVR. AND, this pipeline doesn't involve oil tankers sailing to Asia.

5147 2018-04-12 15:45:56 I just want to go somewhere far away, rub some argan oil on my body, catch a cute tan, let my natural hair flourish, look cute in the sun, let my melanin glisten, dip my cute pedi in some tropical aqua looking water and live my best life listening to that ’doves in the wind’.
5148 2018-04-12 15:45:53 hey @rachelnotley, if you're going to throw taxpayer dollars at the oil industry, you'd get way more jobs by building refineries instead of pipelines. Exporting a finite resource is not a good long term plan, you know? Or build renewables... even more jobs.
5149 2018-04-12 15:45:50 Not their science expertise. Much simpler.
This is 2018. We're no longer in the past century. Now even oil companies support scientific conclusions that humans are causing climate change.
PS: I'm not a climate alarmist. I'm an engineer. Realistic. Calculating. Building things.
5150 2018-04-12 15:45:43 The world , The industrial complex still wants the go to War over oil.  Yet every day we see the signs of global warming. I fear climate change  is unstoppable now
5151 2018-04-12 15:45:17 Excellent article. In addition to the elements described by the writer, the US is facing the challenge of a rapidly increasing debt coupled with the dedollarisation of many commodities (oil, etc.).
And this is without including an enormous gap of US unfunded pensions...
5152 2018-04-12 15:45:13 I thought it was well balanced discussion, as much as could be for a "news" show. I did not see it as pushing an unproven product, but raising awareness they are looking at something. Believe me you, I abhor snake oil as it relates to TBIs because of false hopes (e.g, Carrick)

5220 2018-04-12 15:40:03 That's my qualm w/ NLs offshore oil sector. Global oil demand is going to be filled regardless, we might as well meet it. But what's plan for transition in long term? Dragging feet on carbon price, legislation to prohibit renewables, implementing shoddy net-metering policy.

5255 2018-04-12 15:36:32 The most important thing is that the Arabs keep killing  themselves so  the West can exchange weapons for oil.
5256 2018-04-12 15:36:32 Unfortunately the promise came from DfT. The same caution therefore applies as for buying something from a snake oil salesman.
5257 2018-04-12 15:36:27 More self sustaining systems would be great. But until companies (tech, big oil, etc.) learn how to balance profit with morals/foresight, I definitely support more regulation.

5259 2018-04-12 15:36:18 What about if someday next war isn’t about oil but about the control of BTC and the country that is having the most of it? DUBAI, China, Russia, USA? If one day BTC is valued 1m and have mass adoption, we might see that....
5260 2018-04-12 15:35:55 This Arab League? Anyone know what it does? Why is the Hated West getting involved in wars it can’t win? Arabs have been killing one another since time began without Western assistance. Let them get on with it, to hell with their oil. Having a few less Cadillacs won’t hurt them.

5270 2018-04-12 15:34:20 I think the only shimmering oil I've used so far is the L'Oreal Mythic Oil ($15). It smells so yummy and I like how it feels. Pretty subtle, daytime-appropriate shimmer.

Govt. must explain in totality.  Is it just becoz of mopping money from market?

5280 2018-04-12 15:33:38 If the enviroscientoligist are truly wanting to stop oil production then they should put their money where their mouth is and totally abstain from any hydrocarbons in any form. If not then F.O. already.

5290 2018-04-12 15:32:58 The obvious downside of this is that it contributes to carbon-lock in. Oil producing regime adopts a novel technology, which allows the oil-producing regime to continue production. Cool idea, nevertheless.

5294 2018-04-12 15:32:42 God this can't be happening.  Even Tillerson believed in climate change and he was in big oil.  How can these people especially the Koch brothers be able to buy off these low lives in office to further endanger human kind.  Get big money out of our government...
5295 2018-04-12 15:32:40 @JustinTrudeau if that's true then why isn't Energy East being built at the same time? Why do we import oil from countries who support terrorism? Why does Quebec get to say no and BC can't?

5301 2018-04-12 15:31:50 Do you understand the oil and gas industry at all ? The map referred to is useless when referring to export grade pipelines , secondly I don’t care about every rural household gas plastic pipe or abandoned pipe from a decade ago .
5302 2018-04-12 15:31:37 Yeah, I used to work in a shop back in the day as well! I was a total gearhead! Agreed on the 3000 miles - total scam. I appreciate the cars today have the oil wear sensors in them now.

5321 2018-04-12 15:30:09 Have you checked the global oil demand growth lately? Stopping this project does ZERO to reduce growing oil supply/demand. Simply moves the production to jurisdictions without Canada's globally leading social and environmental standards.

5339 2018-04-12 15:28:16 Agreed. Although rolling into a steep contango should help with the short oil etf side of the trade, but future curve is pretty flat last time i checked.
5340 2018-04-12 15:28:07 Investors are skittish bc they know this is the last major oil investment before the incoming market shocks of the next 30 yrs hits them. A pipeline is a 30yr life cycle capex so that means 15yrs of profit before it's loss leading investment. Which is why gov shouldn't fund this.

5366 2018-04-12 15:25:14 The incoming market shocks from cheap wind/ solar/ nat-gas also 4th gen nuclear SMR's, smart grids, energy storage allowing easy offsetting. More energy efficient devices, homes + fully electric transport systems and restrictive CO2 regs just means oil isn't going  2be lucrative.

5368 2018-04-12 15:24:47 I'd take a million oil leaks if it keeps the oil from being burned.

5370 2018-04-12 15:24:26 Taxing CO2 "pollution"  is not one of the most cost effective ways to fight climate change.  We export about 2 million bbl/day of oil. Your plan amounts to an export tax on this revenue.  Bad enough that CDN oil faces a 'landlock' discount.  Your plan is punitive to $$ for Canada

5378 2018-04-12 15:23:47 Detangling with an oil is less pressure on your hair follicles. If your hair is wet its more elastic and seems easier to detangle but it’s also in its weakest state which could lead to more breakage. It’s a preference thing

5382 2018-04-12 15:23:19 i'm sure i have at least 3 of their oils, 2 scrubs, just ordered some of this shimmering oil and some body butter lol.......they're excellent. Black woman owned, too.
5383 2018-04-12 15:23:13  สู้ๆ
5384 2018-04-12 15:23:10 I need to go get me a oil change..
5385 2018-04-12 15:23:09 Don't need their oil anymore??!
5386 2018-04-12 15:23:09 Just bcause Alta wil let its enviro go to hell doesn't mean BC has to & not even get compensated Ship your oil south via US as originally planned!
5387 2018-04-12 15:23:05 US war crimes commission is steady state of geopolitics. Already a US expeditionary force occupies Syria, (& controls its richest oil fields). Why imagine, after Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Palestine, Yugoslavia, and all the elsewheres Syria will be different?
5388 2018-04-12 15:23:03 How the heck did they get in the house and open the fridge?

My chicken eggs are still safe!
5389 2018-04-12 15:22:56 To create tension in the middle East to push up oil price.
5390 2018-04-12 15:22:55 Consumers need to be made aware that removing palm oil from supply chains may seem like a solution, but alternative oils could require up to 10 times as much land leading to higher risks of deforestation. 1/2
5391 2018-04-12 15:22:55 No it’s not. You coat with an oil. If you do your research you’ll find that there’s “dry” and wet detangling. Different strokes for different folks it works for me RT @ImBackMaybe: I’ve helped detangle hair & I’ll never do it dry. That’s asking for pain.
5392 2018-04-12 15:22:43 อีพีนี้น่าจะครบไว แซง อีพีอื่นไปเล้ย 555
5393 2018-04-12 15:22:41 Keep selling that snake oil to your followers who do NOT read books.  Don’t learn from history and you’re bound to repeat it.
5394 2018-04-12 15:22:31 I'M WRITING MY WRITE UP ON THE JFK JR. & MICHAEL CONNELL FLIGHTS, THESE ARE TRAMP FLUID SABOTAGE FROM DIRT IN THE OIL, FUELS -- & DIRT MAN PROJECTS REAL SUSPICIOUS THERE, WITH FAMILY HISTORY OF TRAMP OIL ISSUES SINCE 1950'S
5395 2018-04-12 15:22:12 If the pipeline is so important for the economy, why doesn't the federal government build a refinery in Alberta and then ship the cleaner petroleum? Remember what Obama said: it is the dirtiest oil on the planet.
5396 2018-04-12 15:22:10 *starts doing shit to oil*
5397 2018-04-12 15:22:06 Sorry without the oil n gas industry the naki is only good for a few days surfing n milking cows, it is a vibrant town because of the money that industry has bought into the town
5398 2018-04-12 15:22:05 Still wishing to see this level of enthusiasm over issues not relating to oil or the carbon tax. Imagine if the Sask Party cared this much about healthcare, renewable energy, education, environment, agriculture, etc.
5399 2018-04-12 15:21:48 Ima need an oil change soon, glad I didn’t have to get another tire!
5400 2018-04-12 15:21:47 It's all about squeezing the last bit of profitability from a diminishing hydrocarbon economy. The shale gas/ fracking boom has made cheap domestic oversupply. For oil sands to remain competitive they have to be sold to export market. This may just be last hoorah of industry.
5401 2018-04-12 15:21:33 Why am I using Mobil oil o 
Lol
5402 2018-04-12 15:21:32 When I was in 3rd grade, a girl moved here from CA and she was devastated that she didn’t get a horse, surprised we weren’t all wearing belt buckles and boots, and wanted to know where all the “oil pumps” were. She was like, “totally a blonde surfer chick” tho...
5403 2018-04-12 15:21:29 Ryan got me an oil vape pen and I been high as fuck ever since 
5404 2018-04-12 15:21:20 So, changing the oil and checking the air in the tires
5405 2018-04-12 15:21:18 Quite amazing how western media forget to ask the difficult to answer questions to Trump and Co and accept the chemical weapins blabla. #geopolitics #powerplay #oil
5406 2018-04-12 15:20:59 bumpy little corn in my family keeps using oil in the bathtub one day im ready to clock out of life now
5407 2018-04-12 15:20:58 wow tea tree oil from the body shop is fcking miracle water LMAO
5408 2018-04-12 15:20:56 Came to Joplin for an oil change and I can say I do not miss it as much as I thought I would.
5409 2018-04-12 15:20:54 Is there much evidence that banning it will be more effective that switching to sustainable? 

Would the alternative oil source be worse? Would the alternative use of the land be worse? That’s what conservation scientists look at. 

Complex questions without simplistic solutions.
5410 2018-04-12 15:20:47 In his famous article shortly before the 2015 general elections, Prof Charles Chukwuma Soludo accused NOI of mismanaging the economy

He said going by oil prices at that time, our foreign reserve should have hit $100b

If reserve is inconsequential, he wouldn't have harped on it

5413 2018-04-12 15:20:36 Really, you should visit the rest of the world. This isn’t an Al Gore induced scam, it’s a fact. First speculated post industrial era, then a conservative scientist in the late 60s. Now the world knows it as fact but a fringe of the US who believe the big oil guys are truthful.
5414 2018-04-12 15:20:33 Man does not live by oil alone. Man must diversify!

5419 2018-04-12 15:20:06 Clean energy today. Stop use of all petroleum products right now, cold turkey. No cars, plastics, air travel or import of OPEC oil. Lead by example.
5420 2018-04-12 15:19:52 Oil pipeline or housing for Homeless.. questions are being asked.... Please will someone in the Notley Gov;t respond to the fears that are out there.

5422 2018-04-12 15:19:48 I’ve tried the long oil equity/short commodity etf trade a few times in the past decade but always got burned.

5428 2018-04-12 15:19:08 As long as oil is going up, Putin couldn't care less about Trump's tweets.
5429 2018-04-12 15:19:08 For example, palm oil could be replaced by butter from cows fed with unsustainable soy grown at the expense of Amazon forest. 2/2
5430 2018-04-12 15:19:05 Why Russian equity bulls should thank oil traders
 
Sanctions have given fund managers a lesson, but higher crude price draws the sting

Oil prices retreat in choppy trading, gold slides
5437 2018-04-12 15:18:46 I'd say the best thing for the country is a civil war. People don't like to hear it, but there is no such thing as an amicable divorce. They are ugly and tear people apart.
5438 2018-04-12 15:18:45 Consumers need to be made aware that removing palm oil from supply chains may seem like a solution, but alternative oils could require up to 10 times as much land leading to higher risks of deforestation. 1/2

5443 2018-04-12 15:18:34 NYX has rose gold bronzer for $12. and all i gotta do is add that to baby oil?! TUH!
5444 2018-04-12 15:18:31 Firming lotion, daytime and nighttime toning oil, facial mask, diffuser necklace, essential oil, body scrub, body butter, head wrap, and Kashmere facial Brush.  You can make your basket with any of their products, because they are ALL AMAZING
5445 2018-04-12 15:18:27 It’s odd that they’re much more willing to believe the vast minority of “scientists” who work for big oil...
5446 2018-04-12 15:18:24 So today i went to an art store to look for oil mediums i didnt plan to buy them cs i just wanted to know the price..my mum was looking at me weirdly and said u hv money in ur bank acc why are u not using it im like the money is for my future

5448 2018-04-12 15:18:11 When they spend 100s of millions on advertising fictional government programs? Anyone in government would have had good numbers. What’s telling is how badly the drop in oil crashed our economy. Barely affected most nations, we were unprepared and vulnerable because of the CPC
5449 2018-04-12 15:18:06 “Control the oil, and you control nations. Control the food, and you control the people.” — Henry Kissinger
5450 2018-04-12 15:18:02 This is not the most pressing need of Ugandans. Let them first deliberate on oil prices. Tuffa
5451 2018-04-12 15:18:02 Calling 400k bpd of oil theft in Nigeria conservative is incorrect and it's not what the reference says. 
If this were true, for it to equate to $1.7bn lost, the oil price would have to be c$140 per barrel.
5452 2018-04-12 15:17:58 What a moron you are. Universities are NOT in the oil promoting business and education says just the opposite. When did you ever educate anyone?
5453 2018-04-12 15:17:54 all i need is baby oil and gold bronzer. that’s gonna cost me about $15-20.

i love Rih but she really had me fucked up.

5461 2018-04-12 15:17:12 I never understood the reason to invade Iraq.  I mean the part about people saying it was to take their oil.
But this looks like the real reason.
5462 2018-04-12 15:17:12 If only I could find my tanning oil....
5463 2018-04-12 15:17:11 @BBClamacqshow Burned the midnight oil playing #DukeNukem the 2D version with a pile of unmarked test papers giving me the evil eye. Kept me sane during my 1st year of teaching in Canada.
5464 2018-04-12 15:17:03 Public sector employees, students, and people who are generally naive may vote NDP again, but anyone in oil and gas, construction, mining, farming, transportation, and any industry that supplies/services them, as well as S, M, and L business owners will be voting UCP.
5465 2018-04-12 15:16:32 Am I alone in thinking that UK involvement in the never-ending tribal conflicts of the Middle East has rarely ended well?

Seems to me that there are no Good Guys to support. 

Just varying degrees of Bad Guys.

And we don't need their oil any more.

Let's stay out of it.
5466 2018-04-12 15:16:27 Is lying to congress a crime? Ownership in Chinese oil company an oversight?
5467 2018-04-12 15:16:12 I looked at the ingredients for the Asda"s Beef Stew and Dumplings Palm Oil was included.Why ?.What possible difference taste wise does it make to have this waste product included in our national food dishes and products
5468 2018-04-12 15:16:10 Our opinion is that removing palm oil from supply chains may seem like a solution, but alternative oils could require up to 10 times as much land leading to higher risks of deforestation. 1/2
5469 2018-04-12 15:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet illegal immigration.
5470 2018-04-12 15:16:09 The difference between "conservative" and "oppressive" is usually oil.
5471 2018-04-12 15:16:06 This isn't a problem about royalties. We have a gov't that federally wastes $8mill on a temporary skating rink, or provincially spends $41k on an adult easter egg hunt. 
I mean $3.8bill to Bombardier and no ROI, yet you talk about higher oil royalties?
5472 2018-04-12 15:16:05 That image is sad but true fact, given the oil reserves Iraq have it should be on that map! 
5473 2018-04-12 15:16:02 Having 2 vehicles is expensive especially when you use both on a daily  one need new tags one needs brakes one need a oil change like wtf 
5474 2018-04-12 15:15:40 There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil it  reeks havoc not only on climate change but has no value to the area it grows in and farmed as it causes loss of habitat to wildlife and endangered species 
there is more info with @ECOWARRIORSS @extinctsymbol  it is not needed
5475 2018-04-12 15:15:38 Russia send a detachment brigade to border of china china also sent a detachment brigade to Iran to fight over oil saudia Arabia and turkey send two detachment brigade to Iran and fight iranians

5480 2018-04-12 15:15:22 By falsely assigning the name "oil sands" instead of the tar sands, Canadians will be forever confused about what the stuff is. 

Jim! What the heck is this stuff? you tell me it's oil but when I look at it, I don't SEE oil at all!
5481 2018-04-12 15:15:19 ถ้าวันไหนมันพังจงเตรียมใจไว้ว่ามันจะพังไปหมดทั้งวัน ไม่ว่าจะร่างกาย เวลา เงิน โอกาส และความรู้สึก จงรับมือกับมันให้ได้เพราะมันสามารถพังไปได้พร้อมๆกันในวันเดียว เหนื่อยได้ ท้อได้ แต่จงมีเหตุและผลเสมอ ทางแก้ที่ดีที่สุดคือเริ่มใหม่ถึงแม้วันหนึ่งอาจจะต้องเริ่มใหม่เพียงตัวคนเดียวก็ตาม
5482 2018-04-12 15:15:09 Actually, most Canadians do want it.  Small, very vocal group of eco-terrorists want zero oil production and will not negotiate from that stance.  It's also not just about a US company, the oil sector benefits from new production due to increased transport capacity.
5483 2018-04-12 15:15:08 This is grandstanding to appease people who voted for the NDP. These voters are fed information financed by foreign controlled oil companies.  Time we all start asking questions about who is paying for the information we receive
5484 2018-04-12 15:15:07 Same old, same old. Highs on gold drew mrks & oil up whilst draging gravity now down again. Will though closer contact w 1325 bounce & give mrks confirmation or eventuall plunge through deny once again?
5485 2018-04-12 15:15:00 What are you talking about? There is no revenue from oil now. You do know that the only revenue from oil is taxation of profits? And that taxes were slashed and there are many expenses to set against profits?  Or perhaps you don't know that.
5486 2018-04-12 15:14:57 @DeadlineDavidL I don't know who else to ask about this.  Have you seen the snake oil salesman selling "miraculous water" on AMC?  Who signs off on ignorance pandering like that?
5487 2018-04-12 15:14:54 What's a good oil that won't fry you to death?
5488 2018-04-12 15:14:53 Tonka is absolutely an essential oil.

5491 2018-04-12 15:14:42 Have you seen the latest - BC now wants Alberta to refine more crude/bitumen in Alberta - the left always want to get into the energy business - whether it is oil/gas, wind, solar or hamster wheels.
5492 2018-04-12 15:14:24 yeah your grievances are understandable, it's basically glorified begging but it can't be helped.... unless you suddenly marry an oil tycoon and can make games for fun without caring about money
5493 2018-04-12 15:14:23 1000 lots on a block trade and another 1000 crossed on the screen in soybean oil. Customers don't even bother to check with the pit. Cost them at least 12k. Apparently they don't care about $. #blocktrades #soybeanoil

5501 2018-04-12 15:13:38 Oil gas routing through Syria to Europe deriving from Qatar/Saudis competed for by Iraq. May’s not particularly bright and incompetent - her actions are like a chicken without a head rather than considered intelligent response - Trump’s a negotiator he’s playing her and others.

5509 2018-04-12 15:12:37 Yes. This is #3. They are desperate for 'regime change' 
Turn Syria into another slave market. That's EXACTLY what will happen.
Actually there are 2 competing oil pipelines that are the real cause.

5514 2018-04-12 15:11:59 he did make good points. But, he does not want to refine in BC (NIMBY). Energy East is too long of a pipeline, by the time you ship it to the east coast and factor in toll charges, it would cost more per barrel then buying and shipping mid-east oil.
5515 2018-04-12 15:11:54 Trudeau shuts down oil projects
5516 2018-04-12 15:11:49 Erika, one part of the cannabis oil protocol that is used to treat glioblastoma multiforme has very very high levels of thc.  It can be very difficult to achieve that as well.  I'd much rather know that my dad was getting a consistent measured dose each time.
5517 2018-04-12 15:11:42 PM Butts's plan for this is to let the Provinces fight it out.
He can keep on saying everything he's saying. When Alberta takes action it will appear to Butts's constituency that Alberta kowtowed to big oil.  Butts will chime in with "if only Alberta would have been patient."

5521 2018-04-12 15:11:19 tbh, I’ve seen people cut it down to even 4 or 5. It just depends on your skin and what you’re trying to do. Basic steps is to double cleanse (oil AND foam), toner, serum/ampoules, moisturiser (with spf)
5522 2018-04-12 15:11:19 aww we could've made yung blooming onion thing! Kaso that needs ALOT of oil cause deep frying.

5524 2018-04-12 15:11:01 Face it, you’re up against highly funded US special interest groups who are determined to shut down Canada’s oil industry. They aren’t protesting the US as they develop & build infrastructure. First Nations are being used as pawns. This needs to be addressed first.
5525 2018-04-12 15:11:00 How is he with security?  1st class airfare?  Oh does he have any science belief left?  I mean if the farm bureau is happy....wait is big oil happy?  How about pesticide producers?

5542 2018-04-12 15:09:28 How wealthy was Japan then?

I think they're a little better now that they import oil, coal, iron, aluminum and wood. That's how we get Toyotas 
5543 2018-04-12 15:09:20 The climate change movement got to the point where its only argument was to blame every hurricane, tornado and winter snowstorm on oil companies. James Varney doubts the current gaggle of climate scare scientists will admit lying to us but we can at least stop paying them to lie.

2 T lemon juice or vinegar
1/2 t salt
1/2 t white pepper
1/2 t dried herbs (I like thyme)
2 cloves garlic

5614 2018-04-12 15:04:00 CBD oil isn’t meant to be vaped a lot. It’s also meant as an additive to vape juice. You can vape it by itself but in smaller dosages. I’ve never had any but I know it helps a ton of people that know how to use it.

5624 2018-04-12 15:03:31 But what you are definitely right about is that as things look RIGHT NOW, we are absolutely fucked.

5626 2018-04-12 15:03:27 The state of California should have imposed tariffs long ago. Just like the state of Alaska does for oil export. It's a valid revenue stream. Why tax your own citizens when consumers outside the country will pay willingly?

I used to work at an auto repair shop when I was 16, and seeing the way they, and other fast-lube places do oil changes, I'll always do it myself.

It comes down to the quality of oil & filter.

5653 2018-04-12 15:01:12 The climate has many different "control knobs."  If any other than CO2 were the cause of the current warming, you can bet the shills for the oil and coal companies would be telling us so.  I note that the great Tom Nelson has not identified any other cause for today's warming.

5657 2018-04-12 15:00:58 New Zealand Government ends new offshore oil and gas exploration whilst the UK Govt makes plans to bomb Syria.  The contrast is astounding.
5658 2018-04-12 15:00:32 And the Iraq War was not about oil. Despite fighting in Iraq for almost a decade, the USA got no oil out of the conflict. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business industry following the end of the war.

5663 2018-04-12 15:00:20 I like so much of what you do, but I really wish Canada would begin to leave the pipelines behind. Time to look to more green energy and leave the oil in the ground.  Time to save the planet. #GreenTrudeauNow
5664 2018-04-12 15:00:13 I wonder if blade oil is the worse in awhile.
5665 2018-04-12 15:00:09 It’s only meaningful if a significant % of Iceland’s own brand products contain palm oil. Otherwise it is puffery.

5686 2018-04-12 14:57:45 There is such a thing as “Diplomacy”. It is a word ignored by Masters of War intent on land/oil and pipeline theft in Syria. It is not a word ignored by the majority of the British people.

5721 2018-04-12 14:54:19 A little more than 20% of Canada’s GDP is made up of oil. It’s tied to our dollar. It’s the largest single contributor to the country. Alberta has environmental policies like no other country. Fair wages for both genders. There is no corruption cuz the government doesn’t own it.
5722 2018-04-12 14:54:18 True that. The Holy oil: virgin olive oil, cannabis buds, myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil. It is a requirement of my faith to give the Holy oil to the sick as Jesus commanded his disciples to do. If I win this federally those of the faith can have the buds.

5740 2018-04-12 14:52:29 “Deliver massive tax revenues into the future”, if the BoE hadn’t injected 1/2 trillion £ into the economy the markets would have crashed. So much for “massive tax revenues” then. And you call NS oil volatile.

5748 2018-04-12 14:52:10 Although I have obviously been one if the biggest bulls on Oil since last year, it feels iffy for Oil to be this high for speculative or fundamental reasons. We need a strong “demand” summer and flattening domestic production to support $70+ WTI. Hopefully the data support prices

5758 2018-04-12 14:50:36 That's true. Almost every country is involved in the oil market. Except Iceland, I think. 100% renewable energy is what I think they have. We can have that too with a #GreenNewDeal proposed by @IronStache and other progressive candidates.
5759 2018-04-12 14:50:34 It is gas and oil also the Saudis will be able increase the price of oil and with that money spend more on arms they buy from the UK and USA so they can continue to bomb Yemen

5761 2018-04-12 14:50:29 there’s a general consensus among the few people who actually study this that this makes simply switching to other energy sources after peak oil functionally impossible. the existence of potential energy supplies doesn’t save us.

5766 2018-04-12 14:49:45 Just something for them to write to sell subscriptions.  We don't need oil.  We have our own oil and fracking.  And electric cars will replace oil.

5778 2018-04-12 14:48:42 Agreed with a few caveats.

Gaddafi's mistake was nationalizing his oil and getting away from the petrodollar.

I was also pointing out that the US has a track record of supporting dictatorships they eventually overthrow.
5779 2018-04-12 14:48:34 If we also have more self sustaining States like Lagos state, the economy wouldn't have taken such a hit during the collapse in oil price.
5780 2018-04-12 14:48:26 But seriously, if you're not a fish eater, you need fish oil. You can't get all your omega 3 from plant sources, as the body doesn't convert ALA well at all.
5781 2018-04-12 14:48:26 Isn’t this the brutal reality? Any discussion of a monopoly (ie Standard Oil) is hard to apply to FB bc 1) you can’t split up a digital network like you can oil refineries, and 2) it has less of a zero-sum game relationship w/consumers than a traditional monopoly.
5782 2018-04-12 14:48:14 The revenue to the Treasury from North Sea oil in 2016/17 was about £60m. 90% of that builds a few primary schools.
5783 2018-04-12 14:48:11 Yhooo, even though her father stole a dollar in every five of oil revenue meant for Angolan Gov ? *Dos Santos
5784 2018-04-12 14:48:08 Wait, are you supporting assad's authoritarian regime as opposed to an actual leftist movement just because they would fight the united states over oil? Source that they're anarchists? I've also been told that Rojava is pro-multicultural.
5785 2018-04-12 14:48:01 @jmclaughlinSAIS @MichaelJMorell
@JohnBrennan just because its the Trump era, is everyone blaise that Pompeo failed to mention he owned a business in China with a government partner in oil and gas? I would not forget if I owned a business in China. He kushnered, his filing.
5786 2018-04-12 14:48:00 Your home is part of a nation. Oil also is national. East coast, west coast, prairies and arctic. Just like trees. Let’s just have provincial import and export tariffs. That way each province can be selfishly theirs!

5789 2018-04-12 14:47:47 My favorite way to enjoy Asparagus is lightly sauteed in butter and olive oil with eggs sunny side up!
5790 2018-04-12 14:47:45 they had to take the timing cover completely off to fix an oil leak i had. once they got the oil cleaned up i have a couple of cracked gaskets and my timing chain tensioner needed to be replaced. and something else i can’t remember now.
5791 2018-04-12 14:47:42 @TdotRome I especially liked the part about borrowing $19B to pay back $45B (oh, but that will be your kids right, or your kids, kids, and by then all of these deficits will be under control (just like we were told 20 years ago by other snake oil salesman)).
5792 2018-04-12 14:47:36 Add oil Marco

5794 2018-04-12 14:47:26 It take two days to get ya oil changed at Walmart.
5795 2018-04-12 14:47:15 It’s also marketed hard and in my company other units want the ‘site seal’ and the ‘green company name’ because ‘customers trust us more’.

Snake oil, but well marketed snake oil. That will at least drag it out for a while.
5796 2018-04-12 14:46:57 Yes, I know your sunflower oil is GMO free because GMO sunflowers don’t exist.  I’m asking if its from sunflowers with an herbicide resistance trait.
5797 2018-04-12 14:46:52 Wrong. It's Kaneh-BOS. Kaneh bosem is the plural which means calamus. Calamus is a toxin used in pest control and was outlawed for use by people in 1968. Federal lawsuit Paddock v. Gov. Butch Otter is winning the right cannabis for use in the Holy oil. I'm taking back cannabis.
5798 2018-04-12 14:46:44 Gullible? You fell for a master snake oil salesman AKA Trump. You’re the dupe

5801 2018-04-12 14:46:38 This works! Want a quick UP lift? Eat an entree sized spinach salad dressed with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a touch of honey, grapes, pecans, cashews, dried figs, cherries, sea salt & dash of grated cheese--real cheese not processed fake cheese. A little anchovy  goes far.

5809 2018-04-12 14:46:13 Not to be a Venusian but atmosphere is so important to me…sometimes I forget how much something as little as scent is important to me until I put rose essential oil in my diffuser or a zen tart in the tart burner and I’m like oh. This is what being calm feels like
5810 2018-04-12 14:46:12 Evidently a lot more than you. It wasn’t the oil industry that crashed the economy in 2018. Tell me again about financial markets not being “a commodity where the value constantly changes”?  Are you really that thick, or is English your second language?
5811 2018-04-12 14:46:11 Researched this rescue and it said the jaws of life and oil didn’t work, so they ended up twisting him out from the tire. ...and apparently he is ok. Glad these fire and rescue workers took the time to save the little guy.

5820 2018-04-12 14:45:24 The “chemical attack” in Syria was staged and you know it. Stop with plans to build oil pipeline in Syria.
5821 2018-04-12 14:45:24 Fort Benning your area and check out the 11 Bravo's  the 13 Bravo's see what they think about that situation  if that leader knew chemical was coming president of Syria and the Russians sold what was the purpose of it? Just to inflict death on people their own people oil

5825 2018-04-12 14:45:02 @kymdouglas can you rec a substitution for almond oil in the nopal hair masque? i am allergic. should i double up on coconut oil? or will avocado oil work?
5826 2018-04-12 14:44:49 Expecting consumers to buy their way out of the climate crisis we are facing is not realistic. For choices to be available and affordable we need to make alternative energy a priority and get people working in the oil sector involved in producing this new energy to ensure growth.
5827 2018-04-12 14:44:39 Like the fact that they there illegally stealing oil and funding the Al- Nusra front white helmets to stage fake chemical attacks in an attempt to once again justify another illegal intervention
5828 2018-04-12 14:44:29 Oil Stocks will be one of the best investments for the next two years. Especially ExxonMobil (XOM) and BP which supply the NATO military with oil.
5829 2018-04-12 14:44:28 #NationalGrilledCheeseSandwichDay I like my grilled cheese like I like my women... Melting in a vat of oil.

5836 2018-04-12 14:43:37 Why won't these senators ask Dr Zuckerman of @facebook about what he's willing to do as a captain of industry to scare off these privateers and pirates who threaten our whalers and thus our valuable supply of whale oil? How shall we light our streets, sir?!? #Facebookwatch

Nah
5841 2018-04-12 14:43:30 Starting to think lack of fish oil was the culprit to my dry skin woes. Since i never eat fish, I never have a good amount of omega 3s in me. Four days in of taking a supplement, no more dry skin.
5842 2018-04-12 14:43:25 I just want this dingleberry snake oil salesman to know:

I WILL NOT BE BUYING A PAIR OF YOUR STUPID PILLOWS !
5843 2018-04-12 14:43:24 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
5844 2018-04-12 14:43:18 No oil in Germany. No future profits to leverage from the established alliances. No sops to whack job evangelicals hoping to force reality to match prophecy.

Guess not everyone needs the seat all the way forward
5847 2018-04-12 14:43:09 Thank you for supplying us with a fantastic product !
5848 2018-04-12 14:43:08 Once that pipeline is through Syria they undercut Russian oil....economy goes, they want to place a puppet in charge of Syria

One year ago: $55.9

One month ago: $64.9

Now: $71.7
5854 2018-04-12 14:42:32 Note that it is not what States save or spend that shores up the reserves that should have defended the naira when oil prices crashed and we slid into recession. It is fiscal responsibility at FG level. So if we're talking recession & oil prices & reserves it's FG.

5863 2018-04-12 14:41:54 The USA is like a kid holding a carton of juice sucking the last drops out with a straw, only in this case the carton is the Earth and the juice is oil. And that's why they're interested in Syria and the Middle East... and Mrs May is the USA's puppet.
#NotInMyNameTheresaMay
5864 2018-04-12 14:41:52 Nothing to do with Syria is just a convenient trojan horse. This all about oil and Iran.
5865 2018-04-12 14:41:51 that shines in too much light. And that shine aint coming from no oil sis.
5866 2018-04-12 14:41:50 It's a general aspect of technology, nothing specific to oil or pipelines.
5867 2018-04-12 14:41:45 猫と女の子どっちが好きかって聞かれたらメス猫が好きって答える
5868 2018-04-12 14:41:42 Yes. This direct comparison is tricky & definitely doesn't take into account the ancillary benefits. We don't eat oil, after all. But in the context of a massive pipeline controversy & people's personal finances, i think its worth the focus. MPG is something ppl can understand.
5869 2018-04-12 14:41:26 @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may Why d'you believe it's acceptable/legal to murder more Syrians? A chemical attack by Assad now would be suicide+insane. Only his enemies would benefit. What does that tell u? Doh. A child can see this is a bullshit phoney "war" for oil. AGAIN.
5870 2018-04-12 14:41:20 natorture buhok ko kanina sa plantsa dagdag pa yung oil na nilagay 
5871 2018-04-12 14:41:18 The YPG/SDF are literally a Kurdish separatist movement (and yes they call themselves anarchists). They most certainly are revolting against the central govt. Your analysis is garbage, and essentially gives USA/NATO a pass for illegally occupying Syria and stealing its oil.
5872 2018-04-12 14:41:09 But, Tar Sands expansion and KM pipe won't be "clean" fuel. And, we should be careful throwing around words like "clean" when it comes to burning oil.

5881 2018-04-12 14:40:11 I could go on and on.  Why would anyone specify themselves as a 'professional commodity trader'.  Is that to imply you're incapable of trading equities.  You know where Oil is going but can't figure out Tesla?
5882 2018-04-12 14:40:02 Good.  They don't like oil anyway.
5883 2018-04-12 14:40:00 I had polymyalgia for years and couldn't walk up my townhouse stairs. No meds helped so stopped taking them.  I detoxed on elderberries and CBD oil. 

I haven't felt this good in 20 years!
5884 2018-04-12 14:39:58 Thanks ! Menu development gone amazing !
5885 2018-04-12 14:39:56 Now the USA, GB, Russia & The EU can legally negotiate the supply of Chemical weapons, military Ordnance for actual field testing for Cheap Oil, then sit back while their media sings the same song in condemning Syria. Gentile Hypocrisy
5886 2018-04-12 14:39:44 Zakallahu khair, anything to help this ladies.
5887 2018-04-12 14:39:42 And bro, I do tell people that NO MATTER WHO ran the economy during those times, we would have faced this same thing we are facing. Go and check the history of Nigeria's economy. Oil lows have always been our bane. And that's been the problem of this country.
5888 2018-04-12 14:39:30 It was spaghetti in tomato sauce, then breaded fish fillets and carrots sautéed in olive oil, and standard whole-wheat bread, fruit of the season, and water on tables.
5889 2018-04-12 14:39:27 God bless you. We were using our looted and depleted reserve to import toothpicks, further depleting the reserve faster and with Niger Delta Avengers wrecking havoc on the economy by blowing pipelines. Govt was only able to defend the NGN when production and oil price improved

5915 2018-04-12 14:36:55 And NS oil was Scottish. If you can take a major part of the Scottish economy out of the figures for Scotland, why can’t you do the same with financial services for England. Is it not on the wee list they gave you to counter any argument?  you’re out of your depth wee man.
5916 2018-04-12 14:36:48 I like the 66.20 level in #WTI. This should be an important support/resistance level.  $CL probably continues its march higher. #Oil #CRUDEOIL @AnthonyGriz @jimiuorio
5917 2018-04-12 14:36:38 yeah crushed up cornflakes. So much better than shop bought ones. Kids love them. I either fry them in a little oil or use spray oil & oven cook them.
5918 2018-04-12 14:36:31 So @RachelNotley wants to ship less oil through BC? Awesome. Let’s close the existing line and stop any train with oil and let Alberta suffer it’s own little fate for her mistakes. #StayOutOfBC cause hostility isn’t a real plan.

5920 2018-04-12 14:36:08 Oil prices were lower in March than they were in the first two months of 2018. Are oil prices too high or too low? Markets set the price ...
5921 2018-04-12 14:36:06 Paging @Doc_Wolverine because I faintly remember having to stop CBD oil due to reactions with my meds.
5922 2018-04-12 14:36:01 That's a crock of shit. Keep the oil in the ground. Invest in solar and alternatives.
5923 2018-04-12 14:35:59 Make sure Trump hasn’t  removed it from the endanger species list, is there oil near by?
5924 2018-04-12 14:35:55 They do have a plan and it’s working. Implement a carbon tax based on social licence then increase regulations to land lock Alberta oil.

5937 2018-04-12 14:34:59 Petrobras and Brazil used to be the same when it came to oil production. No more. Co. participation in Brazil's oil production fell from 93% in 2010, to 75% now (ANP) as country welcomes Big Oil to develop the pre-salt
5938 2018-04-12 14:34:58 Even more oil than Saudi Arabia
5939 2018-04-12 14:34:55 Spare me your outrage. Last admin told the media a week or more in advance every time the US was going to attack ISIS. Remember the announcement we were going to bomb the oil trucks that are Isis owned. When it came time to no one was pushing oil to their base. The advance notice

5943 2018-04-12 14:34:20 ISIS were thriving before Russia stepped in. They were well supported & armed & ran a pretty successful illegal oil trade. *that* was thanks to US foreign policy. Western leaders hate the fact that Russia have thrown a spanner in the works.
5944 2018-04-12 14:34:18 It's hardly new. They've been using booms for oil for decades.
5945 2018-04-12 14:34:12 How will Pompeo defend himself now that's been revealed that he has business ties to a Chinese Gas and Oil company that, as usual, he never provided during his CIA Director confirmation process? Is he planning to lie even more while covering up other ties to foreign businesses?

5954 2018-04-12 14:33:46 It can actually be useful. We can use it to show how well UK onshore and offshore oil and gas production operate and demonstrate our operators excellent environment performance.
5955 2018-04-12 14:33:45 Actually you’re wrong. They make you think that they are risking WW3 for children when in fact, it’s oil and regime change that they are after. If they cared about those kids they wouldn’t have let that chemical attack happen

5961 2018-04-12 14:33:21 Let's not forget ma'am that SLS (as CBN Gov) told us that he was prepared to weather an increase in the inflation figures if petroleum subsidy was removed...noting that he had sufficient reserves to absorb the initial shock...crude oil was close to $90 at the time

5970 2018-04-12 14:31:59 A comment from one of our customers:

Just got my order of your olive oil c60.  I have compared 4 other c60 olive oil suppliers, and yours by far is the smoothest and tasty.
I am making my own in sunflower oil, and you were recommended by K Elmer on youtube. Thanks again, A.S.

5975 2018-04-12 14:31:26 It's what happens when you decide an issue is black & white. Iceland seem to have done the palm oil = bad equation without thinking through the shades of grey. For instance what's their plan for those who will lose their jobs as a result?
5976 2018-04-12 14:31:23 You have been programmed to feel that way. If oil/gas/gold/diamonds etc, were suddenly discovered in Tibet, within months you would be hating Buddhist and those long orange robes they wear.

5979 2018-04-12 14:31:19 You’re wrong about both Spain and 1936 and Syria in 2011.  USA backing Turkey and stealing Syria’s oil is much more important that Kurdish ethno-separatist fantasies. Anarchism is poison to actual revolution. Anarchism is apolitical sabotage.
5980 2018-04-12 14:31:12 I would not only like to thank God but also Jesus for my father scheduling an oil change for me today.

6033 2018-04-12 14:26:02 Was yesterday's threat by Trump to send missiles flying, and watch out Russia!, all just a ploy to influence oil prices? Oil is key to Russia's economy. It's not the first time Trump's bellicose language impacted the market. From allies today we hear no decision made on response.
6034 2018-04-12 14:25:54 London is in England you half wit. It’s the biggest generator of money in these islands. Oil is gone as a major producer of tax revenues here. We ran massive oil surpluses from 1980-1990. Our balance with the UK will turn negative in just over 3 years (1980-2020)
6035 2018-04-12 14:25:47 Only way to protect Ur coast is to stop using oil dummy..no cars no bus no planes no banana's shipped on semis no polyester clothes no plastic smart phone... I could go on, have feeling you are to lazy for that. Oil comes regardless simpleton.
6036 2018-04-12 14:25:27 I just looked at the Kilz primer product information, and it says it’s good under both oil & latex paint. My sister used to be a painter as a summer job-she said the rule was oil paint needed an oil primer but latex could go over either oil or latex primer.

6048 2018-04-12 14:24:22 Labour wants to ban #Fracking  and has a target of 60% renewable energy. That's quite close to banning oil and gas exploration.

Can we expect higher energy bills from labour.
6049 2018-04-12 14:24:21 If you love that seaweed stuff from Chinese then get some kale and whack some salt and oil on it then in oven for a bit, truuust me! Chinese seaweed any time of day 
6050 2018-04-12 14:24:20 True Sire, my question how much furnace oil is included in fixing cost of generation? Is there any formula? Because they get from all sources of generations.

6052 2018-04-12 14:24:10 Don't they have enough Oil to rebuild their own cities? Why would Ass do this, right after Trump said we will pull out? Why can't he defeat them little rebels and regain his country and rebuild? Something fishy in  @POTUS
6053 2018-04-12 14:24:02 El brocoli crudo tambien esta muy bueno, yo lo hago como las ensaladas japonesas: sesame oil, soja y un poco de vinagre de arroz.
6054 2018-04-12 14:24:01 Originally its meat (beef, tripe, lungs, etc. mixed together) boiled in a pot with water, oil and salt only with no other seasoning. Contemporary kapana is open fire grilled meat (typically beef). Am I communicating?

6056 2018-04-12 14:23:52 Yasir, kasan Allah if I had a sister which I don't and my niece are all under age. I would have bought some just to for fun. Too bad banda.
6057 2018-04-12 14:23:45 Agreed. I’m ok with turf. We’re playing in Lucas Oil this year and it’s not as bad as I thought. But not the same as having a stadium built for us.
6058 2018-04-12 14:23:44 ANOTHER reason (as if we needed one) for Dems to regain control of the House in Nov. From what I've seen, Bishop (aka @NatResources) has only one allegiance, and it's to oil, gas and devastation of our natural landscape.
6059 2018-04-12 14:23:39 I want to try oil too maybe I will give try that one. I have dry-normal skin depends on the weather, and you?
6060 2018-04-12 14:23:24 this hair growth oil I bought is sooo good but man the smell  I most definitely have to wash my hair this weekend 
6061 2018-04-12 14:23:23 Trying to sell me on a magic bullet product by listing "deficiencies" of other products (good luck selling that BotW's story isnt cinematic) makes you sound like a snake oil salesman.

If it's so damn good, let the game sell itself.

6066 2018-04-12 14:23:06 Pro-tip: If you want people to notice the tweet that contains important work you've done and want to share, don't also tweet about your kid and your iPhone X as well as The Rock and baby oil on the same day.
6067 2018-04-12 14:23:03 Thanks but I already have a donor engine, the bore of that engine can fit wine bottles in it so I would strip and and #upcycle it as a wine rack/table, if you fit pump to it and use the oil galleries it could be a chilled wine rack 
6068 2018-04-12 14:23:00 Y’all gone be sweating like hell with all that damn baby oil

6072 2018-04-12 14:22:52 I hope it's mostly growing plants. If it's plastics then using coal oil or natural gas directly would likely be more efficient. But I'm just a nuclear wonk. So what do I know.
6073 2018-04-12 14:22:51 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
6074 2018-04-12 14:22:51 I get what he did and why he did it. I’m just commenting on his use of the same finger he rubbed up on his face cause of all the oil and dirt that builds up on everyone’s faces 
6075 2018-04-12 14:22:50 Politicians will do anything for oil, it seems. That’s the root of it all.
6076 2018-04-12 14:22:45 @realDonaldTrump I have so much respect for you sir. The greatest snake oil salesman of all time. Playing this con for almost 40 years. That’s definitely the long dick game.
6077 2018-04-12 14:22:41 Any use a good oil free moisturizer? I can’t find a good one.

6079 2018-04-12 14:22:34 I guess he was just hoping to sell fuel oil to the Russian navy.
6080 2018-04-12 14:22:22 And please take on board what they say. Sustainable palm oil keeps loggers,poachers, traffickers in jobs that means the land (that can never grow back to forests) is used in a responsible way

6082 2018-04-12 14:21:53 Thinking of Canada Action, what country will produce oil in Alberta if Canada doesn't? @350canada
6083 2018-04-12 14:21:46 Y'all think that any period of military conflict is justification to suspend all constitutional rights. Turks and IS are a much greater threat to the existence of rojava than U.S. oil grabbing. Maybe if a leftist government would aid them to be independent... but there isnt one
6084 2018-04-12 14:21:41 Retweeted Annee  (@anneeone):

So will the homeless, jobless, those punished over last 8 years of fake austerity, be asked to go fight a war for rich people intent on getting their fucking hands on oil. #NotInMyNameTheresaMay
6085 2018-04-12 14:21:39 They will not understand it like that. They jumped to the peak oil prices and decided to hold on to that. Which money did Buhari use to bail out States? Which money did the Governors get when ECA was shared? The projects they ar now completing, which money was used to initiate it

6093 2018-04-12 14:21:07 And hats off to @AldiUK for taking such a responsible approach to the issue of palm oil. Unlike the knee jerk of frozen food outlets who don't realise the damage a complete ban will have

6097 2018-04-12 14:20:55 You admit NS oil was a surplus in the 1980s, then argue a case where you remove that. Tell me, when was England’s finances in surplus if you remove the City of London financial services market?

6103 2018-04-12 14:20:09 Ya it does matter because world demand is growing and Canada can either bring our oil to market or some other jurisdiction will. The taxes and royalties pay for our social programs and equalization payments and to shut that down is self harm that makes zero sense.

6106 2018-04-12 14:20:06 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
6107 2018-04-12 14:19:57 No matter what you say it doesn't matter because they are hell bent on the end of oil in Canada.  They are not rational people.

6111 2018-04-12 14:19:54 First of all we were not a mono-economy in 2016.

Secondly, what makes my allusion untrue? Can you clarify with specifics?

I deliberately brought in the OBJ scenario: oil prices were low, reserves were $20bn lower, our economy was less diversified, yet we avoided a recession. 
6112 2018-04-12 14:19:43 Also I like the idea of pipeline being a blemish on a motoring holiday through the Rockies. A visual reminder of impact of oil economy.
6113 2018-04-12 14:19:41 @NdtvLivestream Its high time and @narendramodi should speak up, condemn what has happened in Unnao&Kathua otherwise hes no better than his predecessor.

6118 2018-04-12 14:19:13 Yes but do you know why the falling oil prices had such an impact? It because the socialist government is going around appropriating private businesses and now there is no private industry left to fall back on now that oil is a no go. You fucking fool.

6122 2018-04-12 14:19:09 Oh my gosh. I got my new Temple Smoke beard oil from @beardbrand in the mail last night. Used some this morning and my face smells faintly like church incense.

For a Catholic boy like me.......oh....oh man.
6123 2018-04-12 14:19:07 There is a massive difference between sustainable practice (e.g. Oil palm on historic coconut/rubber/long-cleared land) and oil palm on recently cleared peatlands. And most importantly we have the tools to help identify the good from the bad, thanks to @RSPOtweets and many others

6139 2018-04-12 14:18:08 I need to find the oil man and get that Shaheed oil.
6140 2018-04-12 14:17:57 Rationale is in follow up tweets. But in short: it means you have distributed pipeline monitoring. If a pipe bursts and spills on highway, it’ll be fixed w/in hours. If in wilderness, it could gush oil for days. Put pipeline where people can see it.

6143 2018-04-12 14:17:50 @HPNN $hpnn Peter, we love all the forward looking ideas about the patents and IPRs and the billions of revenues, but we needed something more concrete like, the CBd oil deals, sales, 10q, sharebuyback. Would love to see them in black and white documents. Any update about those?
6144 2018-04-12 14:17:48 America needs to stay out of other countries business & take care of their own! PERIOD! they are doing this for Oil, Land & Power. Don't overthink.

6163 2018-04-12 14:16:20 I tell that to people I fuck with. I’ll give em all the hook ups. Yelp check ins, cheap lube that’s exactly the same as expensive (Gun Oil and PINK brand are the same brand/formula, just marketed towards men/women), ill even send em to diff shops where stuff cheaper. 
6164 2018-04-12 14:16:15 "progress has been too slow to address the widespread issues"? You have the choice to buy from certified sustainable suppliers. Surely demand for unsustainable palm oil needs to be limited. Sustainable palm oil is one of the most land & water efficient vegetable oils available

Not to be confused with digital privacy and human rights. Also they shouldn't be seen as opposing forces for digital services delivery #mytwocents
6168 2018-04-12 14:15:55 We just have the same conversation in which too many overstate the significance of slowing down oil production while in reality it doesn't matter as much.

6188 2018-04-12 14:14:04 Maybe it has nothing to do with your concept of how people should support your bus. interests. BTW Alberta is more than oil & gas industry

6196 2018-04-12 14:13:24 In my honest opinion lot of the quakes shown are just supposed to be human related, with no proof: e.g. The 2012 Emilia quake (Italy) event wasn't connected to oil and gas extraction, the proximity to oil and gas extraction or storage isn't enough proof to infer human influence.

6202 2018-04-12 14:12:57 The Trans Mountain pipeline project is in the national interest, and I am going to claim it is in the world best interest.  I am going to claim our oil is ethical mainly because my ethics are questionable, what with firing a sexual harassment victim and walking out on my job.
6203 2018-04-12 14:12:54 I know. We had the same one. Why I can remember these details of life but not get my oil changed is beyond me.
6204 2018-04-12 14:12:50 In LA with dangerous smog filled air in the 60s and 70s no surprise that most of the parents of my generation died of cancer and heart disease.

6210 2018-04-12 14:11:55 In a country like ours where we solely depend on oil, movement in oil price will surely impact on the inflation rate except we have a sound reserve that will withstand the drop in oil price. All policies are oil price dependent, what the govt is doing now is to move away from oil
6211 2018-04-12 14:11:45 She’s tripping. Baby oil gon burn the hell out of her skin
6212 2018-04-12 14:11:42 Europe and China oil inventories are purposely in blind spot.  Those working on behalf of OPEC to get higher oil price intentionally divert attention to some clandestine oil shipment to Israel.  All good so far.
6213 2018-04-12 14:11:41 You almost need an oil & towel boy 

6214 2018-04-12 14:11:30 Dear @FirestoneAuto the wait for an oil change that I had scheduled is ridiculous.2 hours is not cutting it for me!

6216 2018-04-12 14:11:27 I've heard good things about the strengthening oil
6217 2018-04-12 14:11:22 Is there an oil pipeline we can route through cabbagetown? Or maybe land is needed there for a new maximum-security prison 
6218 2018-04-12 14:11:20 Could be a turtle, or even a dog.
6219 2018-04-12 14:11:15 I agree with Tsigé. I remember when I first was starting out, I was trading oil (and got destroyed pretty quickly), because of the high volatility. I was thinking about the profit I could make in one day with the 3-4% swings.

6221 2018-04-12 14:11:09 Comparing Norway to Alberta is like comparing herring to wheat. Different levels of government, different magnitudes of initial capital investment requirements, different grades of oil, different payout periods and on and on.

6223 2018-04-12 14:10:59 I totally agree with your statement Kimberly. Justin, build more refineries in Canada, especially close to where the oil deposits are found! Jobs, Money and lower fuel costs for all Canadians would be great. Keep some of the money we hand out to other countries and invest in ours
6224 2018-04-12 14:10:55 No, we haven't stopped cooking. We just cook for the right man. Men always want women to know their way around the kitchen. Do men still know how to change car oil and tires anymore or do they take it to the shop. Hell do they know how to fix things around the house. IJS

But it's never about protecting children, or any other lives, for whom they have zero regard, it's about billions in ammunition sales, and ultimately about oil.

6247 2018-04-12 14:08:52 Depends how long you wait for your new civilisation. IIRC the current coal deposits were layed down in the carboniferous about 300Myr ago, while oil is rather younger. Wait that long you'd be fine :-)

6249 2018-04-12 14:08:32 1) Under a 450 scenario world oil production falls ~18% in the next 22 years. It's not at all clear non-Cdn production declines fast enough that Cdn oil exports *increase* over that period and new pipelines are needed.
6250 2018-04-12 14:08:26 Parts of Western Canada have the spirit of the wild west in America. They have prairies and a lot of cattle. The city he is in also has a lot of oil production. It attracts many American businessmen.

6262 2018-04-12 14:07:00 Just because he said it was what he would do doesn’t make it smart or right for our country. It just makes it the rantings of a snake oil salesman trying to sell his wares. Unfortunately many people fell for it.

6269 2018-04-12 14:05:52 It does make you wonder if all this “austerity” is just a ruse to raise money to bomb strategically important  oil rich countries to bits whilst reducing British citizens to a cowed, subservient race of slaves to overseas based non tax paying corporates. Cui bono?

6277 2018-04-12 14:05:28 Well,the acceleration of wealth transfer from the middle class to the top 1%, together with Ryan's staunch defense of access to automatic weapons despite 3 worst public massacres in US history will forever guarantee his legacy in the hearts of hedge fund managers and oil mongers.
6278 2018-04-12 14:05:11 Let me uncomplicate it for you. Oil, greed, pipelines, more greed and they want to dissect the country and share its assets between them. They then want the Syrians to borrow from the imf to rebuild the country leaving them with massive debts and tied to the dollar once again.

6286 2018-04-12 14:04:24 And do you believe that trucking and transporting oil in rail cars is a safe? Give your head a shake! Double walled oil transfer pipes with monitored delivery is the only way to go. Sensors inside the double walled pipe would be a great idea trans Morgan pipeline company..

6288 2018-04-12 14:04:11 As long as the United States wants to continue sucking up oil, we will never be energy independent. Perhaps one day we will see actual moves towards alternative energy sources that would end our dependence on foreign oil.
6289 2018-04-12 14:04:10 Russia isn't going to go to war against the USA, yet. If they gain more strength, influence, and wealth, along with China, Iran and NoKo they will eventually become a huge threat. NWO plan. EU oil pipeline into Europe. We need to nip it in the bud.

6326 2018-04-12 14:01:30 You don’t deserve a thank you. The attack on Syria began before you. All in the name of oil. What those people have suffered is nothing you could ever imagine. Please resign!
6327 2018-04-12 14:01:23 BTW the Politico site didn’t say Booker is squeaky clean it just said some facts have been distorted.   NPR did a piece pointing out his voting record. Booker is in a Pharma State so it’s pretty much the same as Texas Congressmen taking big oil money and voting their way

6329 2018-04-12 14:00:56 Thanks! It’s an adjusted Kyle brush I made a while ago. Can’t remember the name of the original one, unfortunately. Probably an oil brush.
6330 2018-04-12 14:00:48 I mean, one would assume the person offering to do it isn't an idiot and actual puts oil in it
6331 2018-04-12 14:00:42 crush up an aspirin and mix it with a little bit of tea tree oil to make a paste, leave it on over night and then gently wash it in the morning
6332 2018-04-12 14:00:30 Mr. Leye’s graph makes a simple statement of fact: that OBJ somehow - despite record low oil prices - managed to kickstart the dead economy he inherited from the military.

Basically the simplistic argument that the Baba’s recession was caused by “record low oil prices” is a lie.

6335 2018-04-12 14:00:07 1) Labour doesn't have policy to ban UK oil & gas exploration. 
2) This Twitter handle is for Labour Energy Forum, not for the UK Labour Party.

6342 2018-04-12 13:59:14 It's contributory not diversionary. While some choose to focus on 1 source I feel we should also call out this source thats been at it for much longer. The cumulative effect of gas flaring & that of the oil thieves has led us to this point & can get worse
6343 2018-04-12 13:59:13 Better to take oil for pain then take the pain killers
6344 2018-04-12 13:59:02 Is the price of oil on the rise? Barry and Chuck will kick the show off with their oil analysis.
6345 2018-04-12 13:58:58 Might slide. Need an oil change
6346 2018-04-12 13:58:57 What about his failure to disclose his oil and gas company in China? That is a MAJOR conflict of interest. Don’t you think? Or is it that you don’t care since that is your MO as well? I guess he’ll fit right in with your corrupt administration.
6347 2018-04-12 13:58:56 You answered exactly what I have been saying all along.  Shut down the oil sands. That is your end game.  You don't care about reason.  This is the problem with tree huggers.  You just don't get it.

6349 2018-04-12 13:58:49 @CastrolUSA hello
I have naissan patrol 1991 wich oil is good for it and how many distance can cavared
6350 2018-04-12 13:58:43 Definitely agree we should stop 'wasting' time and money in the middle east. Imo its mostly about the oil, and fabricate democratic allies. If we spent less there and more on electric humvees maybe we would be better off in the long run, but that's speculation for ya.
6351 2018-04-12 13:58:43 Absolutely. Also concerned off-gas delivery of ECO is going to diminish if oil boilers are out and RHI can't be claimed too.
6352 2018-04-12 13:58:39 ถามว่ามันจำได้ไหม
6353 2018-04-12 13:58:37 The fuck??! Did he not put actual oil in it?
6354 2018-04-12 13:58:34 They think they don't need oil anyways. In their minds they're 99% green energy anyways.
6355 2018-04-12 13:58:30 Oil, gas and coal are 'free', too.  You just have to convert them into useable energy and get them+the energy to people.  Like wind and solar, THAT costs money.
6356 2018-04-12 13:58:14 Didn’t Napoleon serve in the field to considerable success and pass various anticlerical reforms dragging portions of France and its conquered territories into modernity? Also I think he could probably read.
6357 2018-04-12 13:58:12 Ooh, look kids, some stuff contains oil and oil can burn!!
6358 2018-04-12 13:57:59 Don’t you think it’s a pretty good plan, all I want for Christmas is a real good tan, I’ll rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me 
6359 2018-04-12 13:57:55 Drizzle a bit of olive oil on there, Italian herbs...

6364 2018-04-12 13:56:43 #Opec has removed majority of glut from #oil market but still work to be done by end of year; in long term, oil demand growth 40% by 2040 - need more investment from all players incl #shale

6370 2018-04-12 13:56:09 The oil reserves in Golan Heights should cover it I guess.
6371 2018-04-12 13:56:02 I’m doing break jobs and oil changes all day hit my line!
6372 2018-04-12 13:56:02 And told service to deal with the problem they caused: after the oil change, the car has decided the auto-start-stop needs to malfunction.

6375 2018-04-12 13:55:46 When u work in the oil industry suddenly oil prices rise... Trump just says maybe and maybe not ill bomb syria.. Putin says bring it on..  Wait a minute.. 
6376 2018-04-12 13:55:45 One of my students told me that if you take aroma oil and put it under your nose and behind your ears it helps you sleep and i lowkey want to try it
6377 2018-04-12 13:55:45 Greenpeace BREAKING! New Zealand has just ended all new offshore oil exploration.
This is a HUGE win for the climate and for people power.
6378 2018-04-12 13:55:42 Or maybe M Trudeau could introduce some kind of national legislation to federally control the transport and sale of oil, I’m sure Alberta would support that!
6379 2018-04-12 13:55:13 Exactly... Syria, Russia, Yemen and Iran want War for...... OIL!!!
6380 2018-04-12 13:55:07 You covered your short at 66.40 area then?
6381 2018-04-12 13:55:03 Yawn. If we want to talk about foreign funding how about we look at where profits from Canadian oil and gas operations go & funding for @OilGasCanada? Majority foreign investment.
6382 2018-04-12 13:55:00 Anyone against this pipeline should also stop using all forms of oil. Be consistent in your convictions!
6383 2018-04-12 13:54:59 New Zealand PM Jacinda Adern is no longer granting exploratory permits for oil. It’s time to model leadership for energy alternatives now.
6384 2018-04-12 13:54:40 If the government buy in is strictly as a shareholder then their role will be relatively placid.  Yes, there are boom & busts, but I am not sure there has been a day that oil hasn't moved through the existing pipeline in over 50 yrs. The $ is in the movement of product.
6385 2018-04-12 13:54:11 Do you plan on exposing all the anti-pipeline groups for what they are, paid shills for us oil companies? If you do a little research you will find they are all being paid to oppose the pipeline by us oil companies through the tides Foundation. Us oil doesn't want competition
6386 2018-04-12 13:53:54 So I was after all right to call you a psychopath because according to you, we must let the most powerful people in the world construct a lie to blame the poorest superpower to be able to steal innocent peoples oil? I hope these baltic diotic old methods will never be standard.
6387 2018-04-12 13:53:43 Rihanna’s body lava isn’t even oil based it’s a gel so that was pointless...
6388 2018-04-12 13:53:38 Because we have known since the 70s that we are heading for gridlock and nothing has been done despite all the North Sea oil money. Getting younger people to use public transport rather aspire to get a car at 18 is the most sensible thing I have heard in years.
6389 2018-04-12 13:53:33 Divesting from coal, oil, & gas is great, but @PKAPension cannot receive a green stamp of approval until they divest from MGT Teesside, slated to be the biggest dedicated biomass facility in the world. #Biomass is bad for #climate, #forests, and #communities #ourforestsarentfuel

6391 2018-04-12 13:53:24 Exactly.

It wasn't as though I was setting off a firebomb in the living room via the use of a pan of boiling oil and a water fire extinguisher...

That was my next experiment, that sadly, never came to pass 
6392 2018-04-12 13:53:21 ありがとうございます
6393 2018-04-12 13:53:19 What if governments and companies are using renewable means to produce energy for free and instead charge us in the name of oil?
6394 2018-04-12 13:53:19 Russia, Israel, and Syria must make a deal about the pipeline through Syria bringing oil and gas from Golan Heights to Europe. The deal must be fair to Russia, losing the market in Europe, must be fair to Syria, whose oil it is, fair to Israel that won the land and has the means.
6395 2018-04-12 13:53:09 Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil in a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrims in May
And now the sands become a crust
Most of you have gone away
6396 2018-04-12 13:53:06 Oil can be shut down in one 2 3 but why mess everyone up for certain creatures ? Or I can say take food stamps or oil shuts down or karma kicks your ass
6397 2018-04-12 13:53:01 the stats have also helped to show us that manufacturing contributed more than oil in 2017 & manufacturing continues to grow
6398 2018-04-12 13:52:51 Stop calling it Environmental Protection Agency because they aren’t protecting anything but big oil @SRuhle
6399 2018-04-12 13:52:47 Great to hear this news@tasteofhemed, the more Olive Oil Institutes @Olive_Wellness to promote this wonderful addition to our diet the better
6400 2018-04-12 13:52:42 Wouldn’t that oil have to come by tanker into Burrard inlet - at least a lot of it
6401 2018-04-12 13:52:33 They know that.They don't care. This war is ab.extending the Israeli oil pipeline through Syria+regime change to allow them to do it.Nothing else. For that they need to get rid of Assad, which is why the West fund and support ISIS whilst pretending to be shocked+horrified by them
6402 2018-04-12 13:52:30 the usa wasn't planning on giving back their oil fields....
6403 2018-04-12 13:52:21 Lots of oil and seasoning. Slower roast and don't be afraid to get some colour on them!
6404 2018-04-12 13:52:20 The Christians in #Syria are merely collateral damage for the oil reserves that lie beneath the ground they stand on. Western backed terrorism #CIA #Pentagon #ISIS views you as nothing. They view us as  nothing in the USA as well. #Censorship #Spying #Persecution #DeepState
6405 2018-04-12 13:52:13 These oil companies are TRYING to sell as much as they can before the car manufacturers go ALL electric!!!!
6406 2018-04-12 13:52:02 I couldn’t believe that there 110  countries attacking one little country it seems like everyone wants to attack Syria all of the name of oil. Because there was natural gas discovered in Syria years ago and again no one is talking about that
6407 2018-04-12 13:51:51 Coming to a pointless war for oil near you
6408 2018-04-12 13:51:46 But, I now have a step brother with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, which means he has seizures. He currently is on a trial run for CBD oil out of Europe, and its decreased the amount of seizures he has- but it also made that whenever he has one- it was big seizure.
6409 2018-04-12 13:51:46 まー、たまにはね
6410 2018-04-12 13:51:44 Likewise, #NTOG presents opportunity as the oil price improves etc @mlofgran now finding healthy interest in the story
6411 2018-04-12 13:51:41 .. and it's always about oil, lol. Time to actually make America great and invest in energy solutions that aren't going to cause war.

6413 2018-04-12 13:51:30 Try avoiding potatoes, peppers, tomatoes all the nightshades. They cause inflammation. Try adding turmeric, coconut oil and more ginger to your diet because they reduce inflammation.

6420 2018-04-12 13:50:21 interesting i was thinking of some likely #oil trends and #saudi #aramco #ipo dominates all = nothing todo w supply demand
6421 2018-04-12 13:50:20 All it would take is for one large oil company to say - "ok, because we are doing so much damage to CA, we are immediately pulling our product out of CA" - and CA might actually vote out all the idiots destroying it!
6422 2018-04-12 13:50:12 What if it turns out:
-the pee tape is real
-kushner was dumb enough to do an oil deal
-trump is on tape colluding and conspiring
-comey wasn't lying about all the obstruction
-trump mob ties, and rest of GOP like Ryan, are blown wide open

6424 2018-04-12 13:49:35 We used infused oil or butter because I do not smoke.
6425 2018-04-12 13:49:35 The concern I'd have is that by cutting oil off, the spikes would be temporary. Supply from U.S. would replace it.
6426 2018-04-12 13:49:27 Our government created Al Qaeda, ISIS, and Hezbollah while ignoring atrocities in India, Palestine and other places.

America has destroyed 81 countries since the end of WWII. 

What moral authority does it have in going into Syria for oil interests for Saudi Arabia?
6427 2018-04-12 13:49:27 No they are preseasoned and baked in vegetable oil I ordered them for my wife
6428 2018-04-12 13:49:27 This is true too, although many like to pretend everything past WW2 done by a western power is some kind of benevolent intervention instead of you know, invading states on misleading intel, toppling democracies over oil rights, arming rebels in proxy wars, etc.

6439 2018-04-12 13:48:42 What about corporate entities, are they not litter? Their trucks, their mining operations, their oil derricks, their pipelines, their nuclear waste?
6440 2018-04-12 13:48:40 AB can control how much oil gets exported. It cannot control the destination of the oil that is exported. So, it is impossible to just target BC. 

This is why Premier Notley is calling on the federal government to apply pressure on BC.

6451 2018-04-12 13:47:43 I dont think he realizes it actually states exactly the opposite. The planet has significantly heated up during the past 20 years, and its mostly due to greenhouse gases destroying our O-Zone, and the lack of oil acting as the cores coolent.

6461 2018-04-12 13:46:48 I am speaking actual facts. Maybe you should do some research so you don't come across as ignorant in the future... the main bands and the main environmental groups are all receiving Millions a year in funding from us oil companies through the tides donation laundering service.
6462 2018-04-12 13:46:46 I bet. Direct hit on the Finnart terminal or anywhere along those 2 oil pipelines to Grangemouth would certainly cause a headache. Scotland is one big tinderbox.
6463 2018-04-12 13:46:42 They trim it, line it, oil it and then comb it.

6466 2018-04-12 13:46:06 Oil topping? $dwt not ready yet but keeping close watch
6467 2018-04-12 13:45:58 Well of course, that must be it. I will crown the next person who suggests a keto diet or slathering myself in coconut oil.
6468 2018-04-12 13:45:56 Amazing to see our elected officials going out of their way to support an American oil company run by ex-Enron execs. Sad
6469 2018-04-12 13:45:53 At best, we are purchasing short term jobs (nobody will be buying our oil in 20 years) with the lives of our grandchildren. That's a bad deal.
6470 2018-04-12 13:45:51 thanks mom I really appreciate your bottle of organic olive oil thanks for showing me

6475 2018-04-12 13:45:30 1) apply coconut oil to your hair once a week 
2) instead of shampooing your hair cowash it .(wash hair with warm water and conditioner ) 
3) Jamaican caster oil is really good too .( massage oil onto scalp and hair ).

6489 2018-04-12 13:44:10 The GNP in #EquatorialGuinea is extremely uneven: most of the income from the oil production status in the hands of a small number of very rich people. The rest of the population is no different from the neighbouring countries.
6490 2018-04-12 13:44:08 Now that might be more valuable than oil itself! Problem solved, stop production of bitumen from all open pit mines and let’s build batteries

6492 2018-04-12 13:43:32 Some Geologists will, some will be honest and say it could be bad, but they really don’t know. All will tell you that neat clean aquifer image in your link is a total fallacy. Oil seeps up from the deep shale layers constantly, there are pockets of oil above and below aquifers.
6493 2018-04-12 13:43:27 And the indigenous bands that are fighting against it are being paid to do so by American oil companies who do not want competition. So what's your point?

6495 2018-04-12 13:43:23 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
6496 2018-04-12 13:43:19 Outlooks are converging. We now have one real unknown; DEMAND. If it remains steady, or improves, OPEC+ will force a deep global tightness in oil mkts.  If it weakens, OPEC+ will be forced to either cut further, or accept some degree of over-supply.
6497 2018-04-12 13:43:15 Sometimes to keep things as it is we need to keep things as they were coz we can't accept changes and when prices goes down they decrease the prices not as much as prices of oil goes down. I know but you know why? Loan of oil was due as its extreme level. Modi govt pays off.

6510 2018-04-12 13:41:47 There goes that fantastic tax break Congress and the Prez passed.  But it's ok the rich oil companies that already benefited by the huge tax breaks they already got, just get to add that 14% to their coffers.  State and/or city taxes have already started raising the taxes as well
6511 2018-04-12 13:41:43 Alberta is the backbone of Canada with its oil industry. This pipeline is in national interest and is a safe way of transporting oil. #BuildKM

6527 2018-04-12 13:40:25 Agreed. Considering putting an oil pipeline through Turkey is lunacy. Turkey is already extorting everyone. Adding an asset? Crazy!

6531 2018-04-12 13:40:10 Farmers are having trouble selling their grain cause there’s no room on the rail as it’s being used to move oil now too. This is the trickle down effect that not building these pipelines is causing.

6534 2018-04-12 13:40:05 That's anyone's guess. It's what KM is banking on. But here's the deal, if they guess wrong the asset will be stranded and investors will take a bath. Why are anti km folks so concerned about protecting investors? If AB oil sands unviable then industry will shrink regardless
6535 2018-04-12 13:39:56 Who cares?  Charlie Rose made the situation he's in now.  Maybe he can hang with Weinstein, Spacey, Ratner, and Louis C.K. on creep island where they pass the time lathering each other with burning oil.
6536 2018-04-12 13:39:56 Nope..squeeze them until they squeal. Cancel permits of all oil and gas flowing into BC. Watch how fast they change their mind. Walk softly and carry a BIG STICK. Horgan is a clown. “Alberta shouldn’t resort to retaliatory actions to hurt everyday average BC citizens.” Huh?

6542 2018-04-12 13:39:29 Still doesn't explain why it would be 14% higher than last summer. Did the formula change from last summer? Is oil roughly the same price?
6543 2018-04-12 13:39:28 A guy at work saw our coffee machine read "Time to descale" and asked what that meant. I joked that its because fish parts are used to oil the mechanics and he believed me. Plot twist, he is the OWNER of the company, he has CHILDREN.

6564 2018-04-12 13:37:39 I use JTBD as a lens and a language for talking about users needs and motivations as they are shaped by different situations. IMO it's a way to frame research insights, NOT a method (too much controversy there). And I also cringe when I see JTBD 'snake oil' types posts.
6565 2018-04-12 13:37:38 Ah yes, the smell of oil and smoke, nothing like NYC

6599 2018-04-12 13:34:32 BTW, I find it funny how you have a picture of a fighter jet on your twitter account which uses jet fuel which is made from crude oil! Hypocrisy at its best!

6608 2018-04-12 13:33:44 Also Syria has higher education paid for by the land (oil) no student comes out of college in debt for 10-20 years, many of the people speak 3-5 languages.  Also healthcare paid for by the land, and elder care.  Imperialists can't have that. #HandsOffSyria

6616 2018-04-12 13:32:36 I can’t even...my experiences so similar to this. Last yr my illustration of colonial practices re Native American lands and oil pipes was the hallmark of bad teaching - it took several pgs to say this (there are many examples but that’s the one that made me cry) #solidarity
6617 2018-04-12 13:32:28 Ate some bangla food. Mustard oil cooked. Wish me luck. Nothing happened so far but last time I did this it did not well. No offence to my friends in Bangladesh and Bengal. #ImmunityChallenge #immunity #travelerwoes
6618 2018-04-12 13:32:14 Oooh I really like this phrase they used to say work through the night - raise a lantern and fight the night. Much more applicable to this tech age than burning the midnight oil. #untouchablelovers
6619 2018-04-12 13:32:12 I am not talking about the rule of law because it will get tossed out and I have exhausted that point.  Also, interesting how, although you say it is not OK you do nothing about the whole foreign oil issue.  So why deny Canada?  Can we not prosper too???
6620 2018-04-12 13:32:11 Wow, what a great way to start the race season. We want to thank all that came out to the first Wild Wednesday at Lucas Oil Raceway. We want to send a special thanks to the 169 drivers which took 918 passes on the dragstrip! You put on a great show for everyone!
6621 2018-04-12 13:32:09 Gotta remember to put drops of eucalyptus and lavender oil on my scalp when it starts itching. This stuff feels great
6622 2018-04-12 13:31:57 The horror. I also have to oil my scalp before a protective style. And they don’t be doing that.

6626 2018-04-12 13:31:38 I imagine the end-game is Iranian oil. With a pipeline running through Syria to Israel to move it West.

6629 2018-04-12 13:31:23 I know these are aspects of the tactile experience that might affect whether it's useful to you, so I thought I would try to describe as much as I could. I think it smells sort of like oil pastels.
6630 2018-04-12 13:31:21 So everything they need comes from vibranium?

6639 2018-04-12 13:30:23 Alberta needs this! Oil will be phased out over time, of that there is no doubt. But that will not be tomorrow. We will change as oil dependence wanes, but we need to be able to finance an environment which will accommodate a post oil economy

6655 2018-04-12 13:28:27 That is your answer?  Don't you get the point.  Your main argument is that the pipe will leak and cause enviro damage.  But there are a lot of FOREIGN oil tankers going up and down the BC coast every day from FOREIGN nations who don't protect their enviro.  That is OK to you???

6671 2018-04-12 13:26:55 BINGO! You nailed it! Genie Oil is a big key to deciphering the Syria mess.  No conspiracy folks.  Securing Golan oil & gas for a $7B Israel to EU pipeline is the game.  Recall the Tomahawk attacks on Shayrat airbase (near Golan )?? ‘Twas the day prior to the deal signing.

6737 2018-04-12 13:20:28 This is a pipeline that is in the national interest of Canada.  Why do we import most of our oil? Why is there a lot of oil tankers going up and down the coast of BC right now for foreign nations yet we deny ourselves???

6739 2018-04-12 13:20:17 Hi Don,

What “he wants” is to produce energy. You know, the stuff that allows you to fly to events to talk about things like #ClimateChange 

You what else it does? Brings down the price of oil. Why is that good? It hurts Russia. Below $60/bbl it hurts them a lot.

6787 2018-04-12 13:15:22 Keep in mind many oil spills from pipelines go undetected and anything under 2,000 liters doesn't even get counted as a "leak." 

Honestly, there's too much missing data to claim pipelines are safer (on the environment) than other forms of transportation. At least in my opinion.
6788 2018-04-12 13:15:17 To do oil exploration in Turkana, you must use goods and services that are manufactured in Kenya,   otherwise we can’t increase manufacturing share of GDP in the big four. They must also employ Kenyans - @HonAdenDuale #BungeliveKE
6789 2018-04-12 13:15:09 Never thought about how we smelled lol. I assumed it was because we were brushing them off that they bit us. Did I mention we were naked? Maybe the oil attracted them? Dunno. Every year we get hordes if them trying to winter in our place.

6812 2018-04-12 13:13:07 It might help them to stop thinking of volatility as a property of the market or environment. Volatility is the market and it is all there is. Oil and Dax are really just arbitrary names given to the volatility.

6882 2018-04-12 13:08:05 Not enough is known about Syria, but it's probably not about bringing democracy to the world. It's probably about oil and a pipeline to Europe. The solution is probably simple, as most things are, but more would need to be known to bring a solution to the problem.

6890 2018-04-12 13:07:22 Corporations will gladly abandon oil as soon as they can make a healthy margin producing or selling anything else. They don’t care abt oil, they care abt money. I’m not sure how folks don’t see that.

Yes, of course.

I usually bend towards the party with lesser political/financial gain.

So whenever there's conflict between (say) #US/#AIPAC & oil rich ME nations, I tend to side with the latter.

Mistakes will be made, but addressing wider issues should ensure balance.

6914 2018-04-12 13:05:16 So the people holding plastic buckets and signs, wearing polyester chlothing and lipstick have very little idea about oil.
6915 2018-04-12 13:05:13 Exactly Bob.  They don't want to listen to reason.  All they care about is their end game and that is to shut down the oil sands.
6916 2018-04-12 13:05:11 Skin Tip #9: A gentle exfoliation 1-2x/week is great for #oilyskin, but try not to go overboard with the scrub. Too much exfoliation can irritate the skin, leading to MORE oil production, not less!! #exfoliate #skincare #skincareroutine #beauty #tip #hack #skin

The US Fed appears set for two further rate hikes for 2018, highlighting their confidence that US inflation will hit 2% in 2018. 2/2 That’s a wrap.
6994 2018-04-12 12:58:11  totally lol. Gettin oil for the cars n all.

6997 2018-04-12 12:57:42 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended   that the State of AP  should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG   basin.The BJP govt  is not implementing this recommendation.   #FailedModiFakeFast
6998 2018-04-12 12:57:38 I get that is what you need to do as a leader, but as a citizen.. I need to fight to change this hold that oil has on me, it would be nice to have some support there, but its OK. I got this.  I am saving up to go solar. So #abpoli cant force me to do things I dont agree with.

7003 2018-04-12 12:56:45 At the same time, Louisiana are pushing a bill to make protest against pipelines a felony: 20 years minimum AND $250K fine for just THINKING about a protest against Big Oil. And that's just for the FIRST offence! We don't need constitutional lawyers to see how doomed that is!

7007 2018-04-12 12:56:00 Once I started smoking weed or CBD oil before bed, I've actually started getting some sleep.  For years if I slept I would only get 4 hours of sleep eventually.  There were times i'd go a good few weeks to a month before my body got so tired I'd pass out.

7019 2018-04-12 12:54:42 Ask yourself this, if chemical weapons were used in say a South American country or a country in the middle of Africa, would we be getting involved? No its because of oil, always because of oil, that and being americas puppet #NotInMyNameTheresaMay #Syria #notowar #PeaceNotWar
7020 2018-04-12 12:54:42 Every drop of oil, wisp of gas, and lump of coal will be mined and burned as long as it is economically viable to do so.  Solving the problem from the angle of restrictions is ineffective.  Solve it by finding a better alternative and we will gleefully and thankfully adopt it.

7060 2018-04-12 12:50:36 Agreed. Which is why it is so important to get Canada’s Gay friendly Oil to tidewater. Canada sells oil to US at a discount.  And Canada buys oil from US at world price. Canada needs oil revenue to pay for free medical care. @OttCapitalPride @PrideToronto
7061 2018-04-12 12:50:35 Maybe you guys drive less over there or some shit. I let my old car go like 5-6 months without an oil change and the engine was damaged beyond repair so now I have a shiny new car
7062 2018-04-12 12:50:16 Its all about the oil pipeline chap...
7063 2018-04-12 12:50:04 Yes, I take your point, but the Iraq invasion was as much about America's territorial oil interests as it was about getting rid of an evil dictator. A single bullet could have caused chaos, but was the outcome of a full-blown invasion any more positive for many Iraqis? Difficult.

7078 2018-04-12 12:48:30 What's however true is that QC gov't been really aggressive back in 2014 on doing oil prospection in a national park on Anticosti Island. And the Port-Daniel cement factory too which is super-subsidized and super-polluting.
7079 2018-04-12 12:48:26 Could you explain what govt policies led to the rise in the price of crude oil?

Also, what policies have led to the drop in inflation?

7126 2018-04-12 12:42:48 Precisely it is the taxpayers being expected to finish off what’s left of a ravaged country so the 1% can lay oil pipelines to make themselves richer & arms firms more profit well #NotInMyNameTheresaMay!

7133 2018-04-12 12:41:48 I can’t say the ‘power of government’ versus ‘rights of parliament’ bothers me much here. Both have a history of following the loudest headlines and are honorary & enthusiastic members of the ‘We must do something’ fire brigade - with its long history of confusing oil with water.
7134 2018-04-12 12:41:44 Think I heard that when Palm oil is removed from the label , they will just sell it as other oils????
7135 2018-04-12 12:41:22 Oil is higher and so is inventory, wtf.

7156 2018-04-12 12:39:31 I don’t think the average person understands how much money oil stands to lose if we do what’s best for people and the earth. Fossil fuel is more than just gasoline and power plants.

7209 2018-04-12 12:35:20 All in the name of oil- Saudi Arabia the common denominator. Please Mr Trump we require oil at $80 a barrel! Doesn’t matter if innocent children die. How pathetic the geo-political situation is in the Middle East.

7255 2018-04-12 12:31:55 Hope they’re right - by then there will be a lot more electric cars and demand for oil will be far less.

7267 2018-04-12 12:30:26 Enough talking just get that pipeline built. 1000s of people are relying on the jobs that will be created and not just for Alberta. The oil sands affect people and the economy in all parts of the country. Get it done safely but just get it done!
7268 2018-04-12 12:30:26 Yes, Jagmeet; time to end the double-speak re increased oil flows and environmental integrity.

Shell did explain what "Production entitlements" are in their report though. Maybe they shouldn't have lumped it together with other proper payments.
7275 2018-04-12 12:29:34 Oil pasta? 
7276 2018-04-12 12:29:32 You may be right. Of course, a good way to get an oil pipeline through #Syria is *not* to keep bombing the place.
7277 2018-04-12 12:29:28 Most likely that will be the outcome...question is who will they blame it on.  Currency? Tweets? Syria? Oil?

7284 2018-04-12 12:28:55 It seems to me that many of these people were useful to the west at one time or another & that kept them in place. The same thing appears to be happening with the west's relationship with the Saudis who's human rights record is vile. Common factors - Strategic value and OIL !

7294 2018-04-12 12:28:00 Olive oil can treat ear infections in babies. In drugstores, olive oil is sold as a ear lubricant that softens ear wax and relieves pain. A couple of drops in lukewarm water would be great for the purpose.

7303 2018-04-12 12:26:42 Bullshit... Another Globalist trying to get that oil pipeline ran thru Syria.
7304 2018-04-12 12:26:38 It's saying all oil is equal risk - bitumen via rail is safer then pipeline. Conventional crude or refined product, either or.
Plus our rail lines are already at capacity.  Until Churchill gets their line repaired, that's not going to change.
7305 2018-04-12 12:26:38 Wow, it's actually come to this !
People, everyday people with an internet connection, can avert bombings in a Middle East country just by bagging the POTUS on Twitter !

7313 2018-04-12 12:26:06 Wow they must have burned the midnight oil to come up with that strategy, def was thought of over a game of flip cup and dizzy bat
7314 2018-04-12 12:26:03 Because that would put money in the hands of the 'wrong' people instead of gas, oil, arms dealers.
7315 2018-04-12 12:25:44 sewoon... you're not supposed to deep fry the garlic..... the garlic is drowning in oil
7316 2018-04-12 12:25:42 Ahhh don’t worry. Horgan will just get an extra 200 drilling rigs and do a big bunch of exploration and infill drilling with all his oil fields near Ft St John and Dawson Creek. He can do it. In his dreams. He just has to give the oil companies a HUGE incentive. Create a boom!!!
7317 2018-04-12 12:25:34 No. Turkey was buying oil from ISIS & empowering ISIS before finally coming to its senses after Russia began bombing those convoys of stolen oil & machinery. Turkey looted Syria. The Syrian Arab Army &Russia & Iranian allies defeated ISIS IN SPITE of Turkey &US terrorist sponsors

7322 2018-04-12 12:25:12 You are the epitome of why the east the west don’t see eye to eye. Like it or not, oil accounts for roughly 40% of Canada’s economy. Fuk tards like you are the reason why Canada is a joke on the international stage and can’t talk anyone into investing money into this country.

7340 2018-04-12 12:23:30 SEWOON THATS TOO MUCH OIL
7341 2018-04-12 12:23:27 in all fairness to body shop’s tea tree oil, it really works wonders. My active pimple dried up immediately.
7342 2018-04-12 12:23:21 Yeah I feel that. That’s like 340 dollars here so I sure hope they are doing more than looking because looking shouldn’t be more than like 80 bucks and that’s if they do an oil change while they’re down there
7343 2018-04-12 12:23:08 The shelf with all of our peppers, Oil/Vinger, mayo etc. fell off the wall and spilled everywhere

7406 2018-04-12 12:16:20 They  already pay taxes based on ad valorem. Now, some of the wind farms were offered incentives to build here and the state said they would pay their ad valorem tax for so many years and then it becomes the companies.  What I oppose is the intense smear campaigns by oil & gas
7407 2018-04-12 12:16:18 What is your actual experience in the cannabis industry? Cannabis is regulated from seed to sale. It is tracked and tested. Pesticides and fertilizers are recorded. When it's made into oil, it's tested. If that oil is made into topical or edible products, it's tested.

7535 2018-04-12 12:00:52 not that i am fond of shell oil; however, for those who yammer about the evils of oil, you're more than welcome to return to pre-19th century living/tech.  just know that most of you would likely end up dead

7538 2018-04-12 12:00:14 Yep, and Libya to name one more.  Let’s destabilize the region some more so we can stir up more terrorism.  Then we can change the laws in the name of “security” and take more power from the people.  Not to mention the oil money and for the Military Industrial Complex

7541 2018-04-12 12:00:00 @realDonaldTrump @jimmy_dore If the USA & allies strike Syria (there is NO verifiable reason to) it will mean capitulation to the Zionists who are frothing at the mouth to raid Syria's (& beyond) rich mineral resources (oil, etc) & advance Israel's manifest destiny (Oded Yinon).
7542 2018-04-12 11:59:49 Seriously try some CBD oil, several people use it for Parkinson's and it helps a lot ignore the stigma surrounding it CBD oil doesn't contain THC
7543 2018-04-12 11:59:41 Bolton was inserted (and Trump duped) to topple Assad (Qatar to EU pipeline) & cement Genie Energy's oil rights in The Golan Heights. Next up will be Lebanon, so Israel can steal Lebanon's gas rights in the Mediterranean. I wish Trump would be honest about what the plan is.

7546 2018-04-12 11:59:23 Modi had the advantage of lowest crude oil when he took over. Check data . He had the headwind . For 2 years he kept traveling overseas in guise of foreign policy ignoring country issues. That is where he lost the plot . Control freak without any autonomy to ministers

7589 2018-04-12 11:54:35 That’s the highest countries it takes to extract oil. So now you’re claiming your the brains. Then send me how much it cost and how much we get from a barrel. Il hazard a guess. Does coal mining come to mind Phil ? Cost more to extract than it was worth ?
7590 2018-04-12 11:54:32 Yes we had single digits inflation but like I earlier mentioned;oil prices and depleted foreign reserves - which ought to serve as a buffer - happened.

If we had a diversified our export earnings and not remained an import dependent country inflation rates would’ve been managed.

7597 2018-04-12 11:53:21 Read last week that the US has troops in there already, and in control of 30% of Syria, including much of it's oil.
7598 2018-04-12 11:53:03 AB's debt will be greater than Cda's. Makes more sense to separate.

7680 2018-04-12 11:42:25 I agree.

7683 2018-04-12 11:41:59 This is a game to both. Oil prices rose on the back of the threat. It is gamesmanship without regard to people. Each looking at their own political gain at the expense of reality
7684 2018-04-12 11:41:55 No, white people are the exact opposite of that. White people think a bit of smoked paprika or sesame oil is going fuckin wild.

7693 2018-04-12 11:39:57 But away from political posturing, I’m actually curious about the correlation b/w oil prices and inflation in an oil producing nation that subsidies fuel & FX way below real-world market prices for a ‘diversified’ economy.

Can anyone unbundle this for me?

7704 2018-04-12 11:39:00 The West are trying to overthrow Assad so a gas pipeline can be built  from Qatar at the largest gas field in the world, piped through Syria, into Turkey (who have already finished their part of the pipeline) to supply Europe with gas.

Not oil this time, it's gas.

All of the owners of these clubs are rich businessmen they make their money by selling stuff, does it matter if they sell oil?

7726 2018-04-12 11:35:16 @dpradhanbjp I understand Govt takes part (or all?) of oil companies’ profits + taxes imposed on its sales! Isn’t this double trouble for citizens. Surely Govt can sacrifice more on the profits (not a Govt objective after all!). Also, GST be enforced by Centre on the Council!!
7727 2018-04-12 11:35:15 Of course, that's the responsible approach. But when the current effect is higher oil prices? I'm being cynical here but....
7728 2018-04-12 11:35:13 Well, found out yesterday that I’m incredibly allergic to castor oil. Put some in my hair and BOOM. Hives all over my body. Went to sleep at 7pm  38 more wake ups!
7729 2018-04-12 11:35:13 Thanks America !!!!!

Oh, and you think you're a monster.

7732 2018-04-12 11:35:11 Where can I buy coconut oil?
7733 2018-04-12 11:35:03 Because you do not know emotions of the guy who saw Hindustan Petroleum being painted on an oil tanker. For him it was a historic moment in India's destiny.

7734 2018-04-12 11:35:01 #oott if saudi oil is going to america .. and less is going to china .. where is it going ?
7735 2018-04-12 11:34:59 They will keep pumping. There is little doubt about that. Oil is all about what’s changing. I’ve cited plenty of reasons to be bullish (& I was until $60) but at these prices supply changes are positive and demand will be pushed lower. Ex. Gasoline demand fell in the US last year
7736 2018-04-12 11:34:40 Go on, do you actually believe the wars we follow the US into is anything but to do with oil rights.
7737 2018-04-12 11:34:38 Very hard to ge that kind of breakfast here in La Alpujarra - it’s generally er... bread with minced (or ‘grated’) tomatoes and olive oil ...still overweight though.....
7738 2018-04-12 11:34:29 Palm oil is in my hand
7739 2018-04-12 11:34:28 Thanks @IcelandFoods ! Worth looking into sustainable palm oil sources. Some great research by @BristolZooGdns going on at the moment.
7740 2018-04-12 11:34:26 Add the 3-fold increase in oil sands dilbit shipments if KM is built to the increase due to new pipelines now approved  in the US and Canada and we have proof that @RachelNotley’s oil sands carbon emission cap and @JustinTrudeau’ climate change plans are just Big Lies.
7741 2018-04-12 11:34:01 Thanks for the response. I feel that is a real shame. A big supermarket chain like yourselves may have added much needed klout to the industry and increased public awareness to look for the RSPO logo for certified sustainable palm oil. Feels you've turn your backs on it instead.

7748 2018-04-12 11:33:05 Context, the 2008 financial crisis. Did you know there was no recession in 2016? Zilch. Except Canada of course - our very own, homemade Harper/Kenney branded recession. The exceptional was all massive oil revenues despite those clownshoes.

7757 2018-04-12 11:31:46 You are so suspicious of the US taking your Oil because of George Bush and maybe Dick Cheney. They were in office 10 Years ago. The US is mostly self-sustaining with Oil and Gas. We don’t need Oil from Russia, Saudi’s, Iran, etc That’s why your currency is falling

7775 2018-04-12 11:28:57 Environmentalist should raze the palm oil plantations before harvesting. Lots of pollution but also heavy losses for companies if done massively.
7776 2018-04-12 11:28:47 More oil money is required
7777 2018-04-12 11:28:45 The other side is that many Syrians want to have assad remain. And for them to be able to stay in their country. Assad is dangerous, but what America and their paid rebels have done has decimated Syria. Its all about Israel, oil, petrodollar and reconstruction of Middle East.

7928 2018-04-12 11:11:55 Yes that’s how I feel but given the huge demand for plant oil, you have to wonder what would be used in its place. I think the problem isn’t so much with a particular crop, but how it is farmed. Intensive agriculture is always bad for nature.

7932 2018-04-12 11:11:33 It's about a gas pipeline from the Pars gas field which Qatar can extract, not oil. Largest in the world.

EU are reliant on Russian gas. Syria is allies with Russia. Syria said no to the Qatar pipe going through Syria.

Qatar owns large parts of London. Allies with West.

8061 2018-04-12 10:55:57 Might have known Ann, goodness knows whats going to happen in Syria, we probably won't get the truth even if they do let WHO in.  It seems that oil is worth a lot to many.

8089 2018-04-12 10:52:20 Moisturizer on an acne prone skin does not sound like a great idea. Our  skin tends to produce sebum and dead skin cells that turn into pimples. A  moisturizer helps regulate the oil production of the skin and even  lowers down the pH level.

8098 2018-04-12 10:51:16 We are not helping them, we are killing them. This rush to war isn't about the people it's about the oil. US and Israel wanted assad out. Israel, along with a few elite want to take over the oil fields in the Golan Heights. Stop listening to BBC and msm propaganda. Wake up!

8101 2018-04-12 10:51:05 This is a rush to war as quickly as possible, before any evidence can get in the way. Exactly the opposite of intelligent decision making. But why? This isn't about Assad. It's about oil and gas pipelines and supporting an ailing US and its $. We're on the wrong side of history.

No, it increase in price of crude oil in international markets.

8153 2018-04-12 10:44:03 All you need to know about Syria; Iran has lots of oil, and the best way to move it westwards, is in a pipeline through Syria.

8162 2018-04-12 10:42:59 Nah, wrong. Only reason US is involved in the Middle East is oil. 
Maybe something to do with defending the Jews also, as they have a strong influence in the US.

You aren't ashamed of owing pensioners& disengaged workers now paid by PMB.
8202 2018-04-12 10:36:57 @Honda_UK  yesterday email saying taking some of the oil out of the car, seriously it's a brand new car, warning light come about the oil around 70mph. Today's advise  don't do that, I could of told you that. Surely taking out out of a brand new car would affect your warranty.

8206 2018-04-12 10:36:17 #ThursdayThoughts I wonder if governments would be so concerned about the happenings in the Middle East if it weren't so oil rich 
8207 2018-04-12 10:36:09 Glad you like. @TheVassFiles actually commissioned and edited this one so he'd be best to answer that. I do know there is some research saying the benefits of oil rigs as artificial reefs outweigh the enviro negatives though. I'll see if I can dig it up
8208 2018-04-12 10:35:56 It is reminiscent of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. That level isn't sustainable & sooner or later it will fall over. The oil price is being held down by US shale oil which is a much better geopolitical weapon for @realDonaldTrump than an aircraft carrier group
8209 2018-04-12 10:35:56 Apr.11 (Dow Jones) -- Mexican industrial production rose in February from the previous month and was slightly higher than a year before, with increases in factory output, construction and utilities partly offset by persistent oil industry weakness.

8212 2018-04-12 10:35:40 A Ross..there is a great misconception that USA needs oil from other countries. We are able to make all the oil our country needs. Again, in the PAST, this was true..but no longer. We have plenty of Oil and Gas. You have heard of the Alaska.
8213 2018-04-12 10:35:14 Yeah no bluffing with Putin. WWIII postponed. But Russia sends it's LOVE for higher oil n metals. Congress blesses Russians again.
8214 2018-04-12 10:34:41 Iran has lots of oil. The best way to get it to the West is through Syria. the West don't want to trade with either. That just about sums up what this current situation is about
8215 2018-04-12 10:34:41 The US created ISIS you dumbass with their insane Middle Eastern policy ie:Invasion of Iraq to rid them of WMD's (Iraq is a country so rich of oil lets go get it)
8216 2018-04-12 10:34:34 The salient point is Syria lies smack bang in the middle of the proposed Saudi/Qatar - Europe oil/ gas pipeline. If that gets built Russia is toast economically. All the rest is Kabuki theatre.

Why u increase excise when price fall.u collect extra revenue but where it goes no one knows. We paid 1 rupee in diesel for highway infra as far I remember. But still u need tollgate.

8267 2018-04-12 10:27:25 Just be a waiting war game if Assad does not want to sell Syrian oil rigs to Arab King for an agreed amount, Trump is just stuck in between his Russian wife & Pentagon
8268 2018-04-12 10:27:07 We have been lied to about issues and situations in the mid East since WW1. Turkey bombing Syria, Iran backing Syrian Assad along with Russia. America extracting oil from occupied Syrian territory backing rebels who seem more aligned to Isis. And Kurds as usual stuck in middle.
8269 2018-04-12 10:27:06 i would be not surprised, if that would be true. guess who is the biggest oil exporter? saudi arabia. this lovely country and biggest supporter of the Wahhabism.
8270 2018-04-12 10:26:36 Due to tensions in the Middle East, oil price for June 2018 delivery has climbed to $72 per barrel, the highest in the last three years.

8288 2018-04-12 10:23:48 I understand that, but my own personal opinion is that it was questionable from the outset. And most wars are based on desire for oil or related to protecting the dollar... Just my view. Hate war, support soldiers.
8289 2018-04-12 10:23:26 The oil prices on the overall is extremely volatile in nature ! Nigeria should strive to make the best of this surge in oil prices. Oil prices could even go close to $80 per barrel given the optimism from Saudi Arabia.The crave for oil price boom is too early but a good news.....

8299 2018-04-12 10:20:32 It’s simple:
Low Oil Price suits KSA, as it depresses other producers’ markets. High Oil Price suits Russian gas market and US shale oil market.
War in Syria can drive up the price without directly offending KSA (as Yemen involvement would).

8335 2018-04-12 10:16:12 @KenyaPower_Care  we are experiencing a power outage in Ndederu near MS oil.  We have a black out from yesterday night at 12 midnight.
8336 2018-04-12 10:16:09 It's called oil.
8337 2018-04-12 10:15:58 Can't believe my brother's been hiding hair castor oil and that's exactly what I needed. Stole about half a bottle.. my hair's happy
8338 2018-04-12 10:15:54 Iraq was invaded for oil and the fact that he and Gaddafi proposed an alternative oil market that was not based upon the $. Gaddafi also wanted a pan African currency. That went well for Libya as well. You are a typically dangerous warmonger. Knee jerk ignorance #SyriaStrikes
8339 2018-04-12 10:15:39 hmmmm, yes & no!  Should have made them yesterday but came home to find Pizza had been bought for tea, so we had that instead.  We made the mix with low fat mince and will be cooked in a smidge of coconut oil so pretty low fat, all good, i think we even have gherkins! 
8340 2018-04-12 10:15:21 Check your Engine oil today.
8341 2018-04-12 10:15:14 2/2 We believe that the long-term benefit of palm oil to communities can only come from a supply chain that puts smallhomers first and is is truly sustainable, but until then we are simply ‘saying no to palm oil.
8342 2018-04-12 10:15:10 I don’t agree with the coalition of losers decision re oil exploration.
8343 2018-04-12 10:15:09 Hi Jennifer. We understand your concern. Many examples of research and investigations into the production of palm oil which reveal the exploitation of workers, child labour and slavery.  1/2

8348 2018-04-12 10:14:54 @McVities Hi, in the @thetimes leader column yesterday it said your digestives are made with palm oil. Is this true, do you use sustainable palm oil, and what are your plans to replace palm oil? Thanks! @IcelandFoods
8349 2018-04-12 10:14:29 So I posted on a newfie and groomers page asking for advice on how to help Opies itchy skin and usually, I have all the solutions to this problem and one of the things I’ve been doing is washing in QV wash and oil because that shit works miracles for dogs with terrible skin>
8350 2018-04-12 10:14:16 There was no text book solution to the economic situation we faced,crude oil price was at low levels,oil installation sabotage at high levels etc.Fiscal policy was battered severely so there was no hope for any monetary tool to fix it.
8351 2018-04-12 10:14:09 WHy I oppose strikes on Syria? If you bother to check my TL I explained way back before GE15 what Syria is about. Oil and shale gas and 2 pipelines + defence contracts etc.
8352 2018-04-12 10:13:58 who would have thought so..... but the most important thing is that by saying this... he admitted that the oil price is at a fair value level.... what a genius....
8353 2018-04-12 10:13:54 We are in oil rich country there is no reason for us being gouged
8354 2018-04-12 10:13:41 Yes. His Zionist plan is to invade Syria & then Iran & leave Russia vulnerable.. all of this for the love of oil & create a Greater Israel with those stolen lands. @RussiaConnects

8357 2018-04-12 10:13:23 PM is convening a cabinet meeting to authorise a military response to what she  claims was a chemical attack by Syria in Douma. 
Once again the questions are,  Where is the evidence? Why not take this to international Court?

Answer: Oil.
8358 2018-04-12 10:13:05 Hi Lydia, we have considered sustainable palm oil & recognise that the movement is working in good faith. We believe its progress has been too slow to address the widespread issues of palm oil production. The only way to really tackle these problems is to limit the demand.
8359 2018-04-12 10:12:52 This would be quite nice with a lot less parsley and olive oil
8360 2018-04-12 10:12:48 Plus the main markets for hydrogen are fertiliser production and refining oil - more specifically in the  hydrocracking process.

8387 2018-04-12 10:09:19 Honestly, you're not my favourite olive oil.
8388 2018-04-12 10:09:13 Yup, straight in Olive Oil, & threw seasoning on top. 
8389 2018-04-12 10:09:13 Is it helping?
I'm already researching CBD oil medicine for when I get cancer.
8390 2018-04-12 10:08:57 It’s nice to see where I get my groceries from are starting to remove palm oil from the ingredients of their own stuff.

8392 2018-04-12 10:08:50 No palm oil is great. Replacing it with lard is a slap in the face of vegetarians and vegans, and is also bad for the planet because of the environmental cost of animal husbandry.
8393 2018-04-12 10:08:47 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

8396 2018-04-12 10:08:29 Evidence based policy which looks beyond the electoral cycle, directly responds to grass roots community campaigning, gives certainty to industry, and actively responds to the challenge of climate change - NZ announced it will not grant any more oil or gas permits !
8397 2018-04-12 10:08:25 I KNOW. And the current government is allowing destructive seabed mining. Just as new permits for oil and gas exploration are exhausted, they're conveniently replaced by options to suck vast quantities of sand and iron out of the sea floor. #CoastalErosion #StopSEABEDmining

8418 2018-04-12 10:04:33 The real reason we have planned a scenario to give us an excuse to bomb Syria is that Assad is supported by Putin & is against having a certain oil pipeline in Syria if we genuinely want to do something humanitarian we should help people of the Congo that are being slaughtered

8467 2018-04-12 09:57:34 Sure it had to do with socialism. Chavez nationalized everything and so it was wholly dependent on the oil revenues to keep the thing afloat. A diverse, capitalist economy has several drivers so that if one suffers it hurts but doesn't destroy the economy.

8469 2018-04-12 09:57:24 You can get quite a few bar soaps from health food shops etc. - most of them avoid palm oil too - but reflected on the price 
8470 2018-04-12 09:57:22 True. I buy few processed foods; I cook everything from scratch. Between prep, cooking and cleaning, it’s a lot of work. If I didn’t work at home, I couldn’t. And: my grandma used Jif peanut butter for her pb candy. All I’ve ever eaten, but it contains palm oil. #BoycotPalmOilUse

Just stop please 
Its not fair

8483 2018-04-12 09:54:59 Yeah. I wouldn’t go too deep. I think oil and gas mining is as detailed as you want to go.  As at the domination level more biz units than employees!
8484 2018-04-12 09:54:57 It’s essentially about destroying Russia economically by building an oil pipeline from Saudi and a gas pipeline from Qatar through Iraq, Syria, Turkey and into Europe.
8485 2018-04-12 09:54:51 That’s a different argument to your original statement. Anyway, what percent of prospecting costs stay in NZ, and what’s the royalty on oil extracted from new fields?

8492 2018-04-12 09:52:50 Do these warmongering despots really believe we think they`re going to mass murder Syrians because of outrage over an alleged CW attack rather than because of corporate greed and proposed oil pipelines..next time May is talking about her faith, her Christianity,..remember this.
8493 2018-04-12 09:52:37 Do we still have abundance of oil resources to serve the present population bulge in Nigeria? Talk of using it resources or revenue to work out UHC for Nigerians in 20 years to come? I dont see that as a reality sir.
8494 2018-04-12 09:52:37 What environmental damage have CEO/oil buddies actually caused? Sure, accidents and spills happen. But guess what: there is some environmental damage/risk in everything. Building "affordable housing" and other human development causes environmental damage, too.

8499 2018-04-12 09:52:06 Just met a lady that left oil and gas to set up a manufacturing coy in the US. Told me she took breaks during her career to have babies and bag a couple masters. I'm here trying to cover my shock absorber sound with my radio. I just dey bad mood rn
8500 2018-04-12 09:51:59 Been watching on the telly of going the odd game for 50 years ? Or just got a season ticket when the oil money came ?  Either way your by the sound of it around 60 years old an sayin “il wait “ 
8501 2018-04-12 09:51:54 Doesn’t matter. When warmonger Tony Blair did it with lie propogated by Warmonger Bush. Did public have a say on Iraq. No, it doesn’t matter.

Only criminal agenda and oil rich nation is all it’s needed.

8510 2018-04-12 09:51:15 It is with lavender. From Avon. But you can try to get some oil of lavender at your pharmacy and drope a little bit on your pillow. Works too
8511 2018-04-12 09:51:07 Anybody who tries to obfuscate the link between rising (or dropping) inflation, and healthy foreign exchange buffers in a primarily consumer nation such as Nigeria (where oil is our primary export), is an insincere bystander, and must not be trusted.

8515 2018-04-12 09:50:39 From our visits to Indonesia, we saw the environmental devastation caused by expanding palm oil production, and it’s something that we feel passionately about. (2/2)
8516 2018-04-12 09:50:34 @PurpulHair hi are the prices on the website and the prices at Sphalaphala are not the same? I was charged R200 for the oil and R95 for the spray

8518 2018-04-12 09:50:23 Thanks for your message Tay.

We are replacing palm oil with ingredients with similar nutritional value. As always, we will continue to review and optimise our ingredients to make our products as healthy and sustainable as they can possible be.

We hope this helps!
8519 2018-04-12 09:50:23 Well done Zap Map. As an EV driver that has driven over 43K miles we need all the help we can get. Example is Motorway Service Stations not having any signage to indicate location of charge points. Oil Lobby in control of that one.

8521 2018-04-12 09:50:13 Hi Antony, until Iceland can guarantee palm oil is not causing rainforest destruction, we are simply saying ‘no to palm oil’. Right now, we don’t believe there is such a thing as 100% ‘sustainable’ palm oil in the mass market. (1/2)
8522 2018-04-12 09:50:13 Distribution as well...last I checked invacargill will still need petrol even if it doesn't come from an oil rig of taranaki

8526 2018-04-12 09:49:40 The petroleum &petrochemical (PPC)industry is characterized by a relationship of integration,which allows oil 2 maintain its strategic value if we discovered a new energy Tech,demand of PPC then well expand rapidly,such a Scenario can B considered as plan B in #KSA2030Vision.

8531 2018-04-12 09:48:56 Brent opens today at $73 ppbl RUB rising on MOEX as a result.. 

big diff this sell off with that in 2014 is oil prices are rising which will mitigate much of pain. 

Russian budget breaks even at about $53 ppbl now
8532 2018-04-12 09:48:56 current Russian & Syrian chem weapons use created political instability in eastern Europe & the Mid East - this usually equates to volatility in oil markets (higher prices) - this helps North, Central & South American Oil producers & US jobs - We care about putin's wealth, WHY??
8533 2018-04-12 09:48:51 Someone in the next 20 years will become Nigeria's #UHC hero by using the countries oil resources to provide coverage for everyone. Will it be @MBuhari or maybe another political leader at the @THISDAYLIVE conference? @nighealthwatch #Thisday4UHC
8534 2018-04-12 09:48:48 Just cause he did it with an “aw shucks” affability doesn’t mean that he wasn’t a snake oil salesmen.  His duplicitous nature still dominated his tenure, more driven by politics than practicality.

8543 2018-04-12 09:46:39 Has anyone noticed the price of a barrel of oil has gone up.

8546 2018-04-12 09:46:28 Yes.oil companies can increase price of diesel.,petrol as long as oil prices are half they were 4 years ago

8549 2018-04-12 09:46:19 Hi Maygan, the replacement oils will be different for different products, meaning that there will be a mixture of oils and fats that don’t damage the rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.
8550 2018-04-12 09:46:14 Nigeria has the greatest potential to improve its #UHC performance because it has enormous coverage gaps but it has the resources to close them - specifically oil revenues #Thisday4UHC @nighealthwatch @THISDAYLIVE
8551 2018-04-12 09:46:12 Luckily, it turns out that they have oil. I mean, what are the chances? #Neocon
8552 2018-04-12 09:46:10 New Zealand bans all new offshore oil exploration as part of 'carbon-neutral future' - “committing to transition to 100% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2035 and making the economy carbon neutral by 2050.”
8553 2018-04-12 09:46:01 So why the rush to send the Fall guy to New Plymouth if it was open and transparent. Why did Megan Woods only ring the oil CEO at 7.40pm last night to say this was happening today. Secrets and lies
8554 2018-04-12 09:45:58 Of course. But the prospecting brings money. And any oil that might be found would bring more money.
8555 2018-04-12 09:45:51 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation. #FailedModiFakeFast

8576 2018-04-12 09:43:34 Maybe there isn’t a ‘solution’. The suffering of the innocent Syrian is appalling, but perhaps there genuinely isn’t anything outside nations can do, and it just has to play out. There are appalling events happening in other parts of the world but we don’t seem to care. Oil?
8577 2018-04-12 09:43:16 Falling oil prices is good news for oil importers, however, it is bad news for oil exporters, such as Venezuela, Iraq and Nigeria. Nigeria as an importing country largely depend on oil for it balance of trade, so your data's shows the relationship of oil price and inflation
8578 2018-04-12 09:43:11 This is exactly what the industry needs to recover from the slowdown and uncertainty in the oil and gas market in India.
8579 2018-04-12 09:43:04 Seems Putin is getting well paid for his oil.
8580 2018-04-12 09:42:59 Yeah!  Win - win situation! Loadsamoney for the oil companies  and the US gets to kick some butt!
What could possibly go wrong?
8581 2018-04-12 09:42:53 Idk I sleep so bad. I meditate and try to calm down. Maybe someone can help me with a special sleeping oil, something to eat/drink or a special sleeping routine..
8582 2018-04-12 09:42:33 @SullyCNBC it is hilarious that when you talk about oil fundamentals you only discuss US supply growth. Never the production declines in the rest of the world, robust world demand growth, steep inventory declines wrt 5yr ave. If supply is so high, why no q1 inv build?
8583 2018-04-12 09:42:27 PM modi addressed International energy summit(IES) which has 72 member countries but 92 countries delegates was attending it.He urges OPEC countries to make oil price affordable for consumer countries cited India's oil market demand increases by 4.2% for next 25 yrs.he's right!!!

8585 2018-04-12 09:42:08 20-10 in 1986. That game signified the start of the new era in CU football that led up to the title.

By promoting a war which will fracture Syria into newly formed mini states, then the Golan will become internationally recognized as Israel.

8636 2018-04-12 09:33:23 We don't need more exploration, we need to carefully use the stocks we have while urgently developing alternatives.

Though without the oil industry who would pay Ken Ring to tweet nonsense?
8637 2018-04-12 09:33:19 Now that the burden of higher oil is spread all around, expect RBI to be proactive in OMO and FX intervention as well, already underway . If The Guv is confident of his projected CPI he shd defend the yields.
8638 2018-04-12 09:33:12 The price of crude oil Wednesday rose to $72 per barrel, its highest in more than three years, after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh, worsening tensions in the Middle East.

8641 2018-04-12 09:32:12 Can a credible economist give us an honest nexus between rising FX reserves and dropping inflation?

Can an honest bystander explain why depleting the FX reserves to $28b in a year of crashing oil prices would inevitably lead to a spike in inflation from sub 10 to above 15%?

8658 2018-04-12 09:28:32 They haven't banned oil drilling, so current jobs in the oil industry aren't going anywhere while onshore permits in Taranaki can still be sought for an additional 3 years. That's 30 more years of oil drilling in NZ, more than enough time to transition. Calm ya teets.
8659 2018-04-12 09:28:29 Hi Chris, the replacement oil is different for different products, meaning that there is a mix of oils and fats that don’t damage rainforest. We’re using ingredients like; sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, butter and lard.
8660 2018-04-12 09:28:27 It is free if you don't pay your taxes in this country but keep a house here. The other 27 EU countries manage to get the link between using water and paying for water, versus saying I pay for home heating oil to heat my mansion so get free water as a benefit.
8661 2018-04-12 09:28:19 For all the performative outrage of Opposition MPs today, 57 oil exploration and mining permits in Taranaki remain protected and extraction could continue until 2050. If we haven’t broken our fossil fuel dependence *long* before 2050, we’re screwed.

Using palm oil is simply transferring

8740 2018-04-12 09:17:39 Wait.  Can't we write a petition to stop all oil activities using 3 million signature from Nigerians . I don't know if it's a fine Ideal but that might get the relevant people to act on it now.

8744 2018-04-12 09:17:00 Of all the threads I have read so far. No one has mentioned OIL. Look at all the other atrocities Zimbabwe etc no oil No one blinks an eyelid.
8745 2018-04-12 09:16:43 For all the performative outrage of Opposition MPs today, 57 oil exploration and mining permits in Taranaki remain protected and extraction could continue until 2050. If we haven’t broken our fossil fuel dependence *long* before 2050, we’re screwed.
8746 2018-04-12 09:16:41 If the KMTM pipeline expansion is in the ‘national’ interest, what interest does BC realize?  Lower gas prices?  No expense oil spill clean-up?  PTSD counselling for marine life affected by increased marine traffic? #PrimeMinister
8747 2018-04-12 09:16:35 We would force his 'retirement' once ISIS and other groups are finished. 
Of course, other countries wouldn't get to share out any spoils, such as oil this way.

8753 2018-04-12 09:15:57 The goal of Trump/US is the same as was their goal in Iraq. The total destruction of Syria & the slaughter of millions. All for Oil. As the US once said, the deaths of 500,000 [Iraqi] children is worth it. Human lives mean nothing to American capitalist.
8754 2018-04-12 09:15:40 Does God own  the three-in-one oil company
8755 2018-04-12 09:15:31 We've been told several times esp before 2014 that the oil is running out.  Luckily Holyrood are committed to renewables, like wind and solar power.  I'm not understanding your issue here. Scotland is beautiful.  So is England, but this is an ad for Scotland's tourism, surely?
8756 2018-04-12 09:15:18 Maybe both? But since Perla is 50% coconut oil, I wouldn't be surprised. My dad prefers natural stuff. He used gugo and calamansi before, because that's what he grew up using. :)
8757 2018-04-12 09:15:11 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
8758 2018-04-12 09:15:10 Do we get oil and gas from Syria? I don't think we do. And if what you're saying is true, then why are we antagonising Russia, considering we get a lot of gas from them?
8759 2018-04-12 09:15:09 Yet the remainers will still blame the economy on Brexit, completely ignoring the fact that the GBP is back to the same levels as pre-Brexit with the USD, so the main factor is the cost of oil, not Brexit.

8789 2018-04-12 09:11:07 Isn't it telling how the West ignores untold atrocities in places where we have no economic or military interests (like Africa) and yet immediately get involved in areas where we have strategic military positions or oil & gas supplies pretending it's 'because of the atrocities'?

8814 2018-04-12 09:08:31 Virtue signaling also means you do something but it as no actual effect . How will emissions be reduced by us buying oil from overseas - surely just means NZ produces less and another country produces more - hence virtue signaling

8831 2018-04-12 09:05:53 The stuff that's out there of the East Coast is as deep as the Gulf of Mexico, ruff as the North Sea and not that great quality. The price of oil would have to more than double to make it economical.

8841 2018-04-12 09:03:54 I tend to agree although, I think it's best if US, UK and other allies withdrew from the region, if it wasn't for oil we wouldn't care at all what happened there.
8842 2018-04-12 09:03:48 Britian, France & the US are not going to let centuries of power ebb to the east simply because they don’t have the oil. All three do the bombing in Libya, Syria and Iraq.

Let’s be careful about raising hopes on figures that we ourselves know are not the true sign of things. 

Hope deferred makes the heart sick. Our Political administrators should heed this biblical proverb.

We've considered sustainable palm oil but believe the only way to really tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand so we're ‘saying no to palm oil.’

8997 2018-04-12 08:39:09 Middle Eastern policy has endlessly been divide and rule, use as proxies in our great game, ensure rulers who use oil to our best advantage. Difference at this point in time is only that we're losing to Russia at the moment and it's the first time in our lifetimes.

9011 2018-04-12 08:37:28 clearly, the spike in oil prices in 2008 caused panic, political chaos, anger & a Democrat wave washing over the country. gas price killed consumer confidence & spending, drove up producer prices, food prices....and gas spike from 2010-2014 caused slow recovery despite low taxes

9038 2018-04-12 08:33:53 savoury - olive oil, paprika, cumin and coriander. Delicious!
9039 2018-04-12 08:33:50 As was pointed out by a british palm oil grower. 
“Pay me not to grow palm oil & I will but the country needs to earn & Britain chopped its trees down 300yrs ago why don’t you put them back”!
9040 2018-04-12 08:33:43 #naivequestion if we really invested properly in renewables would we lose our reliance on oil & reduce the desire for war?
9041 2018-04-12 08:33:41 Israel is profiting more than anyone from these wars. They say America got oil but lost thousands of soldiers and the survivors got traumas and injuries. No oil is worth that much. Israel is behind destabilizing the mid east and America is it's tool.
9042 2018-04-12 08:33:10 It is scary what's happening. And it's hard to know what to do for the best sometimes. What will all the Indonesians who are dependent on the #palmoil industry do if we all boycott it? Perhaps working towards #sustainable palm oil is better than that scenario?
9043 2018-04-12 08:32:43 It is not about going backwards to burning near term hydrocarbons (wood, huts, horses).  It is about going past ancient hydrocarbons and forward into an electric age.  Enough solar energy falls on every house roof to easily power it and transportation needs.  Burning oil is dumb.
9044 2018-04-12 08:32:31 The USA really goes after China (Sanctions) and Russia since they have left the Global Reserve Currency on March 26th and since than don't pay for oil anymore in dollars. The USA has a much bigger problem with their national debt now their oil-income go down strongly.

9061 2018-04-12 08:30:28 Palm oil is also one of the largest industry in South East Asia. If we were to totally eliminate the industry then how are they going to compensate that? Regulations must be on the top priority
9062 2018-04-12 08:30:27 Non but I read a lot. And make my judgements on what I read. And at the moment to extract the oil is nearly equivalent to what we get for a barrel. Your a politician. I was one step behind you   A union rep for 20 yrs.

9128 2018-04-12 08:18:17 You're comparing a safety record of a few oil tankers each month to vastly more than that and that's only for starters, based on current projections. It's a busy harbor, yes lots of cruise ships...but fortunately, they're filled with people not loaded with 650 000 barrels of oil!

9130 2018-04-12 08:18:08 Good point. Just as future oil and gas exploration goes on hold, miners start "extracting" vast quantities of sand and iron from the seabed.

9141 2018-04-12 08:15:24 If geothermal was cheaper than oil or gas they would already be using more of it. Obviously the economics don't stack up.

9157 2018-04-12 08:12:28 I don't trust any plan...as soon as Russia gets majority control of Syria through conflict or negotiation they'll rule oil and liquid natural gas... the fruition of the Qatar deal and the Petro Yuan along with Trump antics will see us lose market dominance...that's the plan I see

9176 2018-04-12 08:09:46 I'd much rather screw over OPEC & enrich Venezuela. Especially seeing how they have the biggest oil reserves in the world.
9177 2018-04-12 08:09:17 I learned that California still uses driftnets, and 6 park rangers were killed protecting gorillas. Add that to inter-provincial oil battles, and tyrannical US presidents, and it all becomes clear: It's still the 80s isn't it? It's like I woke to the smell of a hot crimping iron.
9178 2018-04-12 08:09:16 There are larger Ports than Vancouver that do it every day, whether the ships are carrying s**t or shine-ola. 
50 yrs of shipping oil safely must count for something? No one whines when Cruise ship traffic quadruples, as long as there is water, fuel & electricity to service them.
9179 2018-04-12 08:09:14 Do the trend analysis, you will see that the performance of the Nigerian economy in terms of Growth is closely tied to the upwards or download movement of the price of oil. It was the reason for our recession and the recovery. We need to free our economy from this over dependence

9185 2018-04-12 08:07:53 Coal, oil and gas are also harmful, and yet are simultaneously the most important contributors to improved human living standards.  Paternalistic prohibition of psychoactive plants is would almost be laughable if it wern't so stupid.

What we shld be talking about is not the diversification of the Nigerian Economy but the diversification of our FX earnings which presently is over 90% from Oil. This is the reason why our economy recovery so far is still fragile

9233 2018-04-12 07:59:43 Job loss is unconnected to recession which was caused by the fall in the price of crude oil.

9268 2018-04-12 07:53:54 When oil was at it's peak price our fx was 24b so what's your analyst driving at
9269 2018-04-12 07:53:54 ...I thought @dbongingo was the guy who changed my oil yesterday...is he supposed to be someone of importance?
9270 2018-04-12 07:53:53 Anytime I try to make coconut oil, I end up drinking the milk and buying oil instead. Coconut milk is life.
9271 2018-04-12 07:53:34 Stop deflecting. I talk about bananas, and ur bringing up the oil price. 

Google "Gaza 10 day war"
9272 2018-04-12 07:53:25 Core that does look nice !
9273 2018-04-12 07:53:25 What if snake oil actually does have a range of significant medicinal benefits?
9274 2018-04-12 07:53:21 Cause it would make cooking way faster. You wouldn't have to wait for the oil to get hot on the stove.
9275 2018-04-12 07:53:20 the oil stuff is bullshit. Iraq sold oil to anyone. the US had money that Iraq really needed, that's it. 
They sold to everyone who had money
9276 2018-04-12 07:53:14 this is just to raise arms sales, push oil up, move the stock market, and test Russian capacity when US attack Iran...
9277 2018-04-12 07:53:03 Interesting. Please keep us informed. With the disgust I feel with what Adern has done to the oil industry; anything will help.
9278 2018-04-12 07:53:00 Goodnight everyone except the guy who made us all believe coconut oil was good for your diet. Let the bedbugs devour your soul and everything you're comprised of you filthy liar
9279 2018-04-12 07:52:59 *shit hole*. Syria was perfectly peaceful at turn of century too. We've overthrown secularist govs in favour of the extremists they were keeping in check, and why? Because we didn't like what they were doing with oil. Same reason we overthrew Shah in Iran: nationalised oil.
9280 2018-04-12 07:52:49 At least he knows less oil exploration is a virtue. His tweet is theatre of puffery. Proud of NZ fm afar.

I have made my servant king by anointing him with holy oil. My strength will be always with him, my power will make him strong.His enemies will never succeed
9284 2018-04-12 07:52:23 It was Turkey that pushed & backed ISIS in Syria & in lieu was stealing oil & iron from there. You @KenRoth may rely but world is watching. Not good!

9287 2018-04-12 07:51:14 i thank you :) nteresting, yeah its confusing, ive definitely heard mixed things ( some people think  Baghdad is still a friend of the US & its how they still control oil reserves in Iraq. i will do more research
9288 2018-04-12 07:50:50 1/2: So, what is it in Syria that Russia, the US and the UK are all so desperate to have or control that they will kill an entire nation of people in their pursuit? Oil? Mineral? Trade route?
9289 2018-04-12 07:50:41 Of course oil and gas putting a “sunset date” on a lot more.
9290 2018-04-12 07:50:36 อุ้ย...เจ็บ
9291 2018-04-12 07:50:34 The strategy is oil & gas pipelines that avoid Russia. All about resources & getting them to us without going through Russia.The rest is mere smoke & mirrors.
9292 2018-04-12 07:50:33 Hi Richard. Currently 50% of all supermarket products currently contain palm oil. Foods like pies, cakes, packaged bread, biscuits, pizza, ice cream, chocolate… the list goes on. Therefore it will take some time to reformulate these products.
9293 2018-04-12 07:50:24 Just remember that my oil light came on today  and not having time to deal with it until Saturday  Oh also got to get new tags and switch the title into my name instead of my grandpas. I love adulting 
9294 2018-04-12 07:50:09 Yazın bir yere “data is the new oil” çok yanlış bir bilgi!!! Haftasonu @BusinessweekTR deki yazımı okuyun!
9295 2018-04-12 07:49:53 Fuel increment is largely due to the comatose state of our refineries. Crude oil is exported to be imported as refined product into the country. This is simple economics
9296 2018-04-12 07:49:51 And the USA Military Industrial Complex and big oil and Israel who are already in the Golan Heights.
9297 2018-04-12 07:49:45 Wtf muka aku break out lepas guna produk contain mineral oil kot hanat betul
9298 2018-04-12 07:49:25 Petrolde “Araplar ABD ile anlaşma sağladı” kanaatindeyim! 
- #oil fiyatını yukarı taşıyorlar! 
Geçen yıl ABD ham petrol stoklarını Çin’e aktardı, fiyatlar ağırlıklı küresel talep ve ABD stokları üzerinden değişiyor. IEA ikincil önemde!

9299 2018-04-12 07:49:25 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation. #FailedModiFakeFast
9300 2018-04-12 07:49:21 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
9301 2018-04-12 07:49:15 Any excuse for DG to bag Labour. I worked in the international oil industry all my life and at an international conference in 1989 this situation was discussed. The main concern was how long would it take for governments to to take action. It's about time!!
9302 2018-04-12 07:49:04 Syria has oil 

USA & Israel want that oil 
(& land)

Repeat for Iraq Libya ...Iran
9303 2018-04-12 07:49:01 We got our oil at the wrong time.
9304 2018-04-12 07:49:01 or your oil glands going over drive

9306 2018-04-12 07:48:18 Why are you trying to boil oil anyway? 
9307 2018-04-12 07:47:55 We ship an incredible amount of products from the hard working farmers and miners of Canada that would all be impacted by an oil related incident in the Burrard Inlet. Increasing flammables by 7 times through an already busy harbor is much bigger Lac-Mégantic in the making.
9308 2018-04-12 07:47:53 Also there is an oil called Simpson oil made from marijuana which cures most leather cancers in matter of days.
9309 2018-04-12 07:47:30 This is about oil as usual.
9310 2018-04-12 07:46:57 Oil and gas

9312 2018-04-12 07:46:46 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9313 2018-04-12 07:46:45 You are arguing with an 8digit bot, that account is being paid for by someone in either the Oil and Gas industry, or politics.

9318 2018-04-12 07:46:14 The science is not conclusive that oil & gas emissions cause climate change. When infact mans interference in weather via geoengineering could be the cause. So why turn NZ back to the dark ages on the off chance oil & gas are to blame Bring in the new replacement technology first
9319 2018-04-12 07:45:46 Brilliant story - love it
9320 2018-04-12 07:45:45 does baby oil work? doesn’t that sting?
9321 2018-04-12 07:45:41 Good for New Zealand to stop oil drilling & turn to Green Energy. Plastics are produced from oil. Plastics should be banned world wide now.
9322 2018-04-12 07:45:23 Is that an oil film or smth on Youngkyun’s nose hahahahaha
9323 2018-04-12 07:45:22 Van Dijk, Wijnaldum, Robben and Strootman?
9324 2018-04-12 07:45:18 Question how do you solve the world need for oil black gold we forget in NZ we are only a small dot on the worlds stage.

9328 2018-04-12 07:45:11 We all have to get used to life without burning oil. Interesting to hear what you think the case for Independence is built in.
9329 2018-04-12 07:45:06 The truth is that the western countries do not care for #SyriaChemicalAttack or the people of #Syria or for #Humanity ...There main interestis to sell weapon and make money and to get oil at low prices.
9330 2018-04-12 07:44:49 Death trap shitter incorporated? Oh no!; good thing @Ford will take it’s place #boycottMitsucars . As if a boycott would even affect their sales. Rusty crap, oil spraying in your face going down the road, an suv that looks like a 2005 is really the 2019 floor model.

9333 2018-04-12 07:44:39 Wow that article spins all the already thoroughly debunked snaked oil. I’m guessing the “theft” happened because it was better than people finding out the whole project was a scam :D

9335 2018-04-12 07:44:31 Do @IcelandFoods sell cosmetics? I assume they are banning Palm Oil in their own brand food products (which they have full control over)
9336 2018-04-12 07:44:30 If the electronic cars are in place , it means less oil, so it means going forward the oil we have will not mean anything again - Edgar Wiredu #GHToday
9337 2018-04-12 07:44:14 India’s fuel demand rose 7.2 percent in March compared with the same month last year. Consumption of fuel, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 18.62 million tonnes, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed.
9338 2018-04-12 07:44:10 The one I got turns into a massage oil ;) (except it got way too relaxing HAHAHA don’t make my mistake)
9339 2018-04-12 07:44:08 Use almond oil over all over your face and under your eyes every night, it’s a anti inflammatory and reduces the puffyness! That’s what I use and it actually works 
9340 2018-04-12 07:44:06 The trouble with right wing nut jobs is eventually they run out of other peoples children to send off to fight for oil.

9351 2018-04-12 07:42:34 Oil?
9352 2018-04-12 07:42:12 โอ้โห มันดีตรงนี้ อยากกินด้วยยย
9353 2018-04-12 07:41:53 Where is the market uncertainty for the exploration business? Last time I checked we are still an oil based economy. Sit back and watch. This announcement isn’t going to actually change anything.
9354 2018-04-12 07:41:50 More toxic waste batteries. Oh goodie. Look I don't think oil is the future but certainly at this point of our knowledge it is the lesser evil and I don't want to mortgage my grandkids with an issue that worse than oil.
9355 2018-04-12 07:41:13 Obama gave Putin stature,  power and wealth. Putin knew he could push Obama around, and he did it quite effectively.  Best way to beat Putin is to frac, produce oil and gas and drive prices down. Oil is Putin's main export. Destroy Russia's wealth and you beat Putin without war.
9356 2018-04-12 07:41:10 I thought you would pick up on my spelling again? Yes @scotgp, @RISE_Scotland, @The_SSP_, @georgegalloway would all tend to do some wriggling if asked to push indy without oil. At least #SNP's @callum_mccaig has suggested #indyref2 might not mention oil, good times.

9361 2018-04-12 07:40:41 Are still shooting at each other with or without Trump. We are definitely still sending lower and middle class young boys to fight needless wars and sacrifice their lives so we can secure some oil or install some kind of regime change in a foreign country somewhere
9362 2018-04-12 07:40:24 Russia the worlds biggest producer of oil and has started selling its oil in chinese currency, that will see a big drop in both the pound and dollar.
9363 2018-04-12 07:40:24 Theses companies know how to read a budget guys. If they can make the return they’re looking for they’ll still do it. Exploration will continue. Oil and gas will continue to flow. This is fairly hollow pledge IMO
9364 2018-04-12 07:40:23 Expect the same result if Syria is attacked. We have the habit of messing countries & then cut & run.
Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya comes to mind. Seems we never learn. Oil & money is always the answer for our govts to raid others using false pretences. Caring humanity start @ Yemen.

9368 2018-04-12 07:40:04 That's because of Saudi build it, it's in their interest to keep it running and supplying raw crude oil.

India doesn't produce enough oil itself to make use of 44$ bl refinery.

9370 2018-04-12 07:39:52 Statistics on Channel 4 Dispatches (Secrets of Your Cruise - aired July 2017) suggested 1000+ HGVs-alot higher.

Suggest all #Greenwich residents/councillors watch this show
9371 2018-04-12 07:39:42 Yes, I will give you oil but little reaction elsewhere (and yesterday’s oil spike helped by Riyadh missile story). Over last 100 years or so, I reckon there were 10 serious war events; US stocks gave negative returns in 8 of them. But effect is short lived (12-18 months).
9372 2018-04-12 07:39:34 I have two friends who own engineering businesses contracting to the oil & gas industry. If their revenue streams dry up, that’s bad news for the people they employ.

9393 2018-04-12 07:35:57 @realDonaldTrump Mr President. Unbelievable that a Sovereign country - New Zealand will no longer issue permits for offshore oil and gas exploration by the New Zealand Government as part of its commitment to a clean energy future. What idiotic attitudes about climate change.
9394 2018-04-12 07:35:52 why do you think they keep looking for so much oil all the time 
9395 2018-04-12 07:35:32 The foreign aid budget is the only budget not to face cuts. We give money to oil rich countries such as Nigeria, India which has a booming economy Even China. The Uk Taxpayers are being mugged of bigtime
9396 2018-04-12 07:35:03 If you live in New Zealand you can now start talking shit on nonvegans, oil consumers, A/C, rainforest clearings, and pretty much anything else that’s eco harmful. That country is actually making moves towards a future that ignores that the sun will still explode someday.

9399 2018-04-12 07:34:58 Mass investments in EV and public transport (across the whole province)  while opposing big oil would make this government the most idealistic and progressive in BCs history. That's the BC I remember you campaigning for. Hope it comes to fruition

9429 2018-04-12 07:31:36 Hi Andrew. Currently 50% of all supermarket products currently contain palm oil. Foods like pies, cakes, packaged bread, biscuits, pizza, ice cream, chocolate… the list goes on…
9430 2018-04-12 07:31:34 I think so. Makes sense. Lower ruble, higher oil prices and drop in mkt = value value value
9431 2018-04-12 07:31:11 Yeah I don't disagree that times nearly up for oil. 30 years or so seems a reasonable time frame to transition. As long as there's a plan and significant funding and support for those in the industry. Otherwise they are just setting the region up for failure
9432 2018-04-12 07:31:06 I have worked for an international oil company for all of my working life and I fully support the governments decision. The company I worked for identified the need to convert from hydrocarbons in 1989. It's no surprise!
9433 2018-04-12 07:31:00 And who seized the oil manufacturing and made it the backbone of its socialist utopia? 
9434 2018-04-12 07:30:51 Sinister: as US destroys land and water w fracking and fossil fuels, the Saudis are getting off oil, yet keeping the $ / barrel high enough to make fracking profitable.

9466 2018-04-12 07:26:38 I can understand Taranaki's concern on no new oil/gas permit
However:
1) Existing permits run to 2050
2) Big Nations like France, UK, province of Ontario, and Norway are withdrawing from oil, coal or both
3) There is divestment in fossil fuels by international funds
9467 2018-04-12 07:26:34 The bit where they put CO2 underground and it stays there forever. That bit is bad. Further, I think using CO2 for advanced oil extraction is a sham.

9470 2018-04-12 07:26:22 They won’t go into war because they have been provoke beyond that. That’s the reason restoration via referendum they’re a fighting for. British won’t allow due to oil derivative %. There is soots and oil spillage, yet the British oil company could not deem it fit to fix it.
9471 2018-04-12 07:26:10 You predicted the same also at 10k, 9k, 8.5k... etc. But your snake oil is still good so no worries!

9474 2018-04-12 07:25:56 Sorry for my naiveness but what is it exactly that you put in the oil? That's just powder? Or is that a highlighter I don't know about makeup that much sorry
9475 2018-04-12 07:25:04 @Tesco why do you still sell #krill oil? @superdrug, @Morrisons, Nature's Best and Holland&Barrett have decided to stop to protect the Antartic. Do the right thing and join them.
9476 2018-04-12 07:24:59 Yeah! more middle-eastern oil!
9477 2018-04-12 07:24:32 Hope so as well Rod
We do know the existing permits run til 2050
However with the big nations withdrawing from oil and coal we are going to have to ask Now What cause we wont make it til 2050 running status quo
9478 2018-04-12 07:24:31 Argh so we stop what we do now hoping something better is out There- but we don't know. We hope in finding it that the waste is less offensive than oil- but we don't know.

9481 2018-04-12 07:23:50 Key word is "weak".

Weakness leads to the xenophobia, homophobia, racism, acceptance of fear mongering and bunker mentalities that led to Trump.

And the ones who exploit that weakness are opportunists, modern day snake oil salesmen in it for themselves.

Sad.
9482 2018-04-12 07:23:43 Once he told me he likes the way my hair smells right after I wash it. So, everytime i washed it since then Id try to remember the exact combo of shampoo, 3 conditioners, and oil that I used that day, just for him. I guess it wasnt right bc he liked the way hers smelled better.
9483 2018-04-12 07:23:33 Born in ‘73, certain facts have been clear all my life: 1) Oil dependency cripples economies 2) Oil use poisons our air, water, food 3) Better alternatives exist.

9484 2018-04-12 07:23:31 When there is as yet no evidence for Assad gassing his own people. Why would he when terrorists already beaten? Surprise, surprise, there is plenty of oil in Syria that US want to keep their hands on under the guise of humanitarian aid. 'Humanitarian' and Trump poles apart.
9485 2018-04-12 07:23:06 Australia is instead looking forward to the massive economic booms inherent in oil spills. Just ask @BP_plc
9486 2018-04-12 07:23:03 1. It's socialism's fault that Venezuela depends on oil so much in the first place. Can socialism only work with oil money? 
2. Venezuela's problems started with Chavez, not with the declining oil price. Erosion of democracy, corruption, bad economic policies.

9494 2018-04-12 07:21:26 Or how in Modern Warfare, people from Arabic countries are almost always evil, whereas the whole fact that America is in the Middle East in the first place is it's own desire for oil.

Ideology, pure and simple.
9495 2018-04-12 07:21:17 So out of curiosity and since according to the Citizens United ruling, corporations are people too, does this mean the AK AG will consider out of state criminal history when dealing with climate change causing multinational Big Oil interests operating in Alaska ? @NRDC
9496 2018-04-12 07:21:14 listen, some may say this is a quote: "HOT TAKE" but... fuck oil dude, we need to hop back on the horse to fight for the honor of fruit companies again because in reality, true reality, what is war without the fruits of it's labor? just some things to think about.
9497 2018-04-12 07:21:11 We have to be selling locally extracted oil at around $70 per barrel in order to be able to balance out with with our debt within 10 years. But for now we have to lock China's reserve at a higher price to be competitive in our goal.

Forest clearance.
9514 2018-04-12 07:17:56 When the choice is between oil produced in New Zealand and oil produced in Nigeria, banning prospecting at home is NOT the responsible option.

9527 2018-04-12 07:15:33 oil prices trending down at significant rate... Iran likely to export with greater ease in years to come, Iraqs oil fields becoming more productive as things settle, In addition to the north american energy revolution.. its getting less lucrative and isn't worth risks.
9528 2018-04-12 07:15:24 Let the Modi govt come out with method of fixing of oil prices daily. What is the basic price, oil marketing company's percentage of profit, transportation charges, retailers commission etc. It should not be left to OMCs alone, as oil prices determine other prices too.

9533 2018-04-12 07:14:45 @MinhazMerchant shouldn't the government let the USD fall a bit to cushion the rise of oil? Why is it fixated on export income when India is a net importer

9539 2018-04-12 07:13:05 India's position in the oil& gas segment will now strengthen. World's no 1 petroleum company, Saudi Aramco, will set up its facility in Maharashtra. The facility will have Indian PSU OMCs as joint venture partners.  In India, petroleum consumption is rising at 5% every year.

9541 2018-04-12 07:12:33 NZ Labour Govt. have banned new oil exploration. Oil actually  saved the whales.  Before the mid 1860's, oil for lighting and machinery lubes, came from whales! If everybody did what NZ Labour Govt. did, would we be back slaughtering whales?

9547 2018-04-12 07:11:59 @NZNationalParty have just scuttled any chance they had of working with the greens by saying they want to drill for oil here there and everywhere
9548 2018-04-12 07:11:52 A bit of an assumption there. Wind has a tiny footprint even when you factor in the making of the turbines. Solar is much worse on the front end and back end but last a long time. Both still crush alternatives like coal and oil.

9640 2018-04-12 06:58:18 @ForestEssential I am disappointed to see your products contain palm oil. The palm oil industry is linked to deforestation, climate change and animal rights abuse in the countries where it is produced. I would expect your products to be free of such ingredients.
9641 2018-04-12 06:57:58 The low global oil price is driving Alberta’s economic crisis – not the price differential. New pipelines will only serve future expansion of high risk tar sands, and deepen the dependency of the Albertan economy on a boom and bust cycle.

9656 2018-04-12 06:56:02 Day 27 of using the peppermint essential oil marks the 17th time I got some in my eyes.... who trusted me enough to let me use it unsupervised???
9657 2018-04-12 06:55:49 I have a question! Has anyone with oily skin tried vitamin e oil? Did it make them break out? My face is breaking out and I think it’s the vitamin e oil. But it makes my skin look nice too so idk what to do lol

9659 2018-04-12 06:55:35 When we so much really on agriculture, before the oil, naira was equal to ponds in exchange and naira was more than dollars :":
9660 2018-04-12 06:55:24 More forward thinking from New Zealand saying no more offshore oil & gas exploration permits and a commitment to renewable energy sources and carbon neutrality.

We need more leadership, less politics, like Jacinda Ardern.

9661 2018-04-12 06:55:19 @TheCentipede2 Venezuelan here, I came here to laugh at you.

We had shortages even with a high oil price back in 2010, wanna know why? Socialism.
9662 2018-04-12 06:55:12 Get some #MYN bought. Transformational news expected this week on the stimulation of a heavy oil well. Process leads to the oil becoming less viscous. Currently Stockdale Morris 1 produces 16-18bopd. This procedure could materially improve that number.  News likely this week.
9663 2018-04-12 06:54:57 The drill program for #MATD has been brought forward from June to May. Wild Horse bumped back 1 month to July & larger than Falcon structures have been identified, potentially with Turbidites so more likely High case for Oil not mid case as previously stated

9667 2018-04-12 06:54:37 they are capitalist countries that built their wealth over colonization of african countries.  they were able to offer public insurance for a % of their pops because of financial success, now through oil drilling in the black sea. bernie wants that? no. he wants m4all, that's it.

9670 2018-04-12 06:54:08 @realDonaldTrump U are responsible for the attacks in Syria. U are responsible for everything that is happening bad in the world. U think violence is going to help u make u a better man. It's all about oil, money, weapons and money. U ain't got take nothing with u when u die.
9671 2018-04-12 06:53:48 So the uk is considering an attack on Syria. Are we doing this for: A-to Acquire oil, B- a vanity project for Theresa May to get more votes in the local election. C- to distract people from the mess the Tories have made of the country, D-all of the above.

9680 2018-04-12 06:51:59 From the reaction, you'd think that oil and gas was suddenly going to disappear overnight. In reality, it's just a first step to a fossil free future. As for methanol, it's mostly used in plastics and we all know where they end up. Roll on alternatives.

9683 2018-04-12 06:51:49 Also don't forget the huge amount of oil in Syria that bankers, media moguls etc have invested interests in..
9684 2018-04-12 06:51:35 Hmmm. I don't think anyone wants no oil. We should however be moving towards sustainable clean fuels. That's just common sense. Have a good day.

9692 2018-04-12 06:50:08 No, they’re still going to be ‘free’. Along with ‘free’ school meals for all, even if you can comfortably afford to pay for them. I presume Labour have discovered the world largest oil reserves under the Isle of Wight.

9694 2018-04-12 06:49:56 How about an article that reads: Human beings create stuff that later they don't know what to do with and cannot control. We're still dealing with Fukushima, oil wars, arms race, metamphetamine, opioid abuse, etc. Everybody loves a scapegoat though.
9695 2018-04-12 06:49:45 I was upstream strategy manager at Shell. Oil price collapsed in 2014. Industry significantly reduced global investments 2015-2018. Projects coming on stream today took investment decision in 2014 when oil price was $100+. From 2019, few conventional projects will come on stream.
9696 2018-04-12 06:49:45 While SB21 was patently corrupt, and the only reasonable rationale offered was “¯\_(ツ)_/¯ because the oil companies asked and [hand waive] 2m bbls [mumble mumble]”, I’m not aware of a current plan to make specific strategic tax changes. Have I missed something?
9697 2018-04-12 06:49:29 What's the UN for? How can the US say we've got shiny new missiles and will aim at targets in Syria.. Why again would Assad use chemical weapons when no need and knowing the world would turn on him.. The big agenda gain control of Syria for Oil and gas pipelines?
9698 2018-04-12 06:49:19 Also I think you are misinformed if you think that "when oil demand lowers, supply lowers".

Historically, when oil demand has dipped, the suppliers have INCREASED supply in order to lower the price and stimulate demand to rise again.

9706 2018-04-12 06:48:11 We saw what you did their. Blame Russia for everything, so EU stops buying Russia Oil/Gas. USA supplies oil/gas to Europe instead. - tries to bankrupt Russia in the process. Makes it easier to control Russia.
The #DeepState isn't very clever or black, once you realise their MO.
9707 2018-04-12 06:48:06 Why aren't people talking about the pipeline & Syria's resources (oil which the US want & why they are there in the 1st place), openly?!?

9712 2018-04-12 06:47:29 Mom & I also decided that oil based primer isn’t much fun to work with. Two rooms will likely need a 2nd coat of primer because of the current paint colors, but I’m strongly considering latex for the 2nd coat. :-)

9718 2018-04-12 06:46:49 I've never been a big fan of big oil. Had a holy fit when the Exxon spill happened. Not a fan of windmills though. They spoil the natural beauty.
9719 2018-04-12 06:46:49 The Middle East wouldn't be stable even if they had no oil. The money from their natural resources only exacerbates their conflicts.
In the case of Mexico, we don't have to imagine. In the case of Canada, we only have to wait.
9720 2018-04-12 06:46:38 Maybe they’re running low on snake oil and hot air?

9748 2018-04-12 06:42:45 The real test of this so called reform was when oil prices started going up. This move shows this was no real reform ...expected though ..also shows why govt will never privatise OMCs and by that logic PSBs...govt needs them to shoulder the burden of their doleouts
9749 2018-04-12 06:42:16 Driving up oil prices like Saudi is trying to do right now will lead to only one outcome : a faster shift than ever to renewables. Investors money will to windmill. Rent seeking from producers will be met with anger.

9755 2018-04-12 06:41:35 Did the govt force Henry Ford to build the Model T? Did the govt force Elon Musk to build EV cars?

9791 2018-04-12 06:34:53 India of the 1999 was a toddler on the world stage when then society was way more sober, and corruption and communalism not yet institutionalised.

Maybe you should read up where India would have been if the oil prices had not crashed in Oct-2014?
9792 2018-04-12 06:34:28 nothing like driving out of the airport and seeing oil derricks everywhere. i've never seen one before that.

9824 2018-04-12 06:29:01 What kind of oil did you use? Some oils can erode certain metals and even make a machine too slick.

9829 2018-04-12 06:28:34 Doesn't have a choice. We're dependent on the Saudis for decades for their oil exports. We have to break that dependence. Sooner the better. Oil exporters also own a huge chunk of the USA's debt. Just like they'll own the debt of the Omnibus bill we don't have the money for.
9830 2018-04-12 06:28:26 Seems they are drilling oil at Cardinal Otunga plaza or someone is doing a tunnel to Cityhall's strongroom.Some scary excavations there
9831 2018-04-12 06:28:26 I disagree. That's the same logic that keeps us using gas & oil despite its negative effects on the environment. There are other communication channels available & new ones can be created especially given the right opportunity.

9915 2018-04-12 06:12:33 Also oil rich countries will never have effect of sanctions because no one respects them bcoz it's a crucial and rich resource. Most of the countries you said are rich in oil or nuclear which are the best and crucial resources needed by anyone

9918 2018-04-12 06:12:06 Julie Anne, with respect, folks who *are* concerned about climate change still have not heard how this policy can actually reduce either local or global emissions, since oil production will simply shift overseas 1:1. The Govt really does need to explain its thinking.

9920 2018-04-12 06:12:00 So the jobs lost are limited to the drilling permit timeframes and the revenue lost is actually taxes and lease fees?  What is link to NZ consumption then that people are making? They seem to me to be two different things just both associated with oil?  Am I missing something?
9921 2018-04-12 06:11:43 Oil? I wonder what would we rather take a hit on? Rates or Fx? Because one of the two has to sell-off when inflation expectations move up. Thoughts?
9922 2018-04-12 06:11:41 @1NewsNZ @winstonpeters @TheAMShowNZ @Amanda_Gillies @markmywordsAM @DuncanGarnerNZ Has anyone the cojones to ask @jacindaardern  and @jamespeshaw to give an informed quantifiable measure of the difference stopping NZ oil exploration will make to #CLIMATECHANGE? Please?

9932 2018-04-12 06:09:12 I can't stand Trump. But it's his enemies who are the Nazis. Obama was a commie. Hillary is a crook.

9941 2018-04-12 06:07:41 Northern Gateway was by far the better option, but he killed it; & his changes to regulations killed Energy East. This pipeline is all that’s left. 85% of tanker traffic (foreign oil we import) is in the St. Lawrence seaway - hear any hysterical shrieking? Me either.

9946 2018-04-12 06:07:17 Tiresome argument - Socialism destroyed the entire internal economy of Venezuela, making it dependent on oil exports to trade for goods from other countries. Their oil industry has also slowly collapsed since nationalization - they'd still be bankrupt today at $120 a barrel.
9947 2018-04-12 06:07:13 I’m not against oil, nor—although I admit I don’t have the info on them—am I against pipelines. However, I am against Kinder Morgan for economic, environmental, and because the federal govt worries about it more than much more important things. Needs more study and safeguards.

9949 2018-04-12 06:06:48 I could be wrong, but I don’t think much (if any) of the oil extracted in NZ is refined here: we import that.

9953 2018-04-12 06:06:19 Yep. Russia took a large hit during the oil downturn in 2014 as well, largely because they didn't diversify their economy enough. The price of oil has somewhat recovered from those lows since that time. If it was JUST the price of oil, Venezuela would have stabilized by now.

9989 2018-04-12 06:02:39 Uh, that’s not what that document stream talks about. Leaving ponds standing for 25+ years is not remediation. When the oil sands were initially developed, the companies and governments specifically touted remediation.
9990 2018-04-12 06:02:29 Agreed. Has to start with FFP dealing with the oil clubs first, most of original big clubs (g-14) probably didn’t want football to get to where it is now, but have been forced to splash the cash in order to keep up.

10011 2018-04-12 05:59:33 @SabCharlie all factors are relevant and add to the Grand picture, I'll give you that, but this isn't about oil from a USA perspective. This is a so-called civil war entering it's 7th year.

We're talking about a lost generation in Syria, a death toll estimated between 350-400K+
10012 2018-04-12 05:59:33 World oil use is 97 million barrels a day and will increase to 110 million barrels a day as the third world pulls out of poverty. You will have to accept that fact
