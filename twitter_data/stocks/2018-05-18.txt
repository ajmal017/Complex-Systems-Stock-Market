18 2018-05-19 23:50:58 I wish they would 'overreact' by making assault weapons and bump stocks, grenades and C4 illegal, everywhere! Background checks would only be useful if everyone needed them, to buy weapons. There are too many 'PRIVATE' sales and unregulated gun shows.

43 2018-05-19 23:49:43 Ban bump stocks and any device intended to make a single-shot weapon into an automatic weapon.
44 2018-05-19 23:48:14 Ban Bump Stocks.
45 2018-05-19 23:47:56 Hopefully the senate will send Bill C-45 back to the house with amendments the house can't agree on and the bill dies. The resulting stock market crash of over valued cannabis stocks will bankrupt those profiteers with their dystopian view of what legal cannabis should look like.
46 2018-05-19 23:46:57 Indeed it is cool.  In any event, they are in the process of outlawing bump stocks anyway.
47 2018-05-19 23:46:55 Ban bump stocks. It’s a no-brained.
48 2018-05-19 23:46:41 HaHahahahahaha.  King of denial.  That is not the solution.   There counselors on the school grounds.  My solutions are  Ban bump stocks.  Raise the age to buy a gun.  Secure doors better.  Buy back of AR 15.

52 2018-05-19 23:42:14 May I ask, I know I can do a simple Excel sheet to track how the stocks are doing and surprisingly JSE nor my broker provide a simple P&L on their website. Is another way you keep tabs of the stocks?
53 2018-05-19 23:41:41 Not terrible. Depending on your age in may be better to stick with stocks more.
54 2018-05-19 23:40:53 My money is  on the Muslim, so long as the tranny isn’t white. A Christian beautician would be in stocks by now.
55 2018-05-19 23:39:40 Ban Bump stocks!
56 2018-05-19 23:39:06 #BanBumpStocks yes, these bump stocks need to be banned at very minimum and to start.
57 2018-05-19 23:38:51 Enough! Ban bump stocks.
58 2018-05-19 23:38:45 @realDonaldTrump i belive in trump and investing in stock market as long as trump is in i belive stocks will flourish
59 2018-05-19 23:37:42 Agreed. I’ll tell you this I can support banning bump stocks, doing background checks, taking away guns from violent felons. And raising the age for a semi auto gun to 21 or 25. But I can not support banning a gun. Do I believe it will fully stop shootings NO.
60 2018-05-19 23:37:36 Looked back thru the thread and I dont see a mention of bump stocks though my eyes are getting a little tired.  In any event, a bump stock is highly inefficient at automating a rifle as the accuracy is terrible and was only used in Las Vegas as I recall.
61 2018-05-19 23:36:40 Bump stocks work by taking any amount of aim control away by using the weapon’s recoil to launch the next cartridge. This is the opposite of gun safety.
62 2018-05-19 23:36:36 Who needs them? Please ban bump stocks.
63 2018-05-19 23:36:24 Ban bump stocks.

73 2018-05-19 23:31:33 It is not possible to reason with people that would sacrifice their own child just so that they could wave around an AR-15 and bump stocks
74 2018-05-19 23:31:27 Ok in Santa Fe he stole his dad's guns, which were legally purchased by the father. So by the terms of the "common sense "  gun control mandate:
1. Banning bump stocks - he had a shotgun
2. Banning assault style guns - again he had a shotgun
75 2018-05-19 23:30:52 Item that makes a gun fire close to full auto ex bump stocks. I know if you are skilled you can still fire fast but most mass shooters are not that skilled and couldn't do it. Semi auto shotguns banned, pistols that take more then 10 rounds banned. Any attempt to modify

91 2018-05-19 23:22:31 But why was my labor worth less ten years ago than it is today if money is only a tool for accounting? Why do savers need to be punished? It certainly isn't to prevent the rich from getting richer. They do that through real estate, stocks and other investments.

102 2018-05-19 23:14:56 Also it says a well regulated(laws) militia. A bunch of gun owners with no association with one another is not a well regulated militia. Don't get me wrong I am pro gun. I am just not pro guns like the AR15 which you can buy bump stocks, and 100 round drum magazines.
103 2018-05-19 23:14:47 We can and we will ban bump stocks!

116 2018-05-19 23:06:47 M16 is the military designation for AR-15, the only difference with the two is that AR-15 sold to civilians is semi auto only. I don't think air force ever used M16s. But I agree, ban the bump stocks.

122 2018-05-19 23:02:31 You helping sell AR-15’s and wepons right now also bump stocks aren’t the only modification to a AR-15 to make it full auto lol do you even know what a AR-15 looks like?
123 2018-05-19 23:02:02 I disagree. Not body says you can’t own a gun. There is nothing in the constitution that guarantees a right to AR-15s, bump stocks and an unlimited number of bullets.
124 2018-05-19 23:01:24 I Joined robinhood options and I mostly buy long calls on stocks I believe in. Research the stock as much as you can and don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.

129 2018-05-19 23:00:06 If NDP gets in or even close, I would recommend everybody invest in US stocks until June 7. Their platform is pure insanity. Nobody would dream of investing a penny in this province for years. Let’s hope that message gets out to electors.
130 2018-05-19 22:58:44 ban bump stocks.

143 2018-05-19 22:52:16 Trump expanded the background check and questionnaire for Gun Purchase! MSNBC should make a visit to a gun store and see what has changed. Trump has also eliminated sale of bump stocks and several states have raised the purchasing age to 21 for all gun! The shooter broke the law!
144 2018-05-19 22:52:08 Raced with Allmendinger on iRacing awhile back Street Stocks on Charlotte it was cool watching him drive that open race.
145 2018-05-19 22:51:44 ban assault rifles and bump stocks
146 2018-05-19 22:50:46 Assault weapons are banned. Assault = automatic, automatic is banned. The bump stock allows semi automatics to mimic automatic. Bump stocks were created as a loop hole to the ban already in place. If ppl want 2 make headway on this they need to know the proper definitions & vocab
147 2018-05-19 22:50:45 Ban bump stocks. I support gun control legislation
148 2018-05-19 22:50:04 I used to run a street stock league where this was basically how we raced. Street Stocks... following the Cup Series schedule... it was awesome. I'm loving the racing I am seeing tonight so far!

152 2018-05-19 22:46:07 Ban bump stocks now! 
153 2018-05-19 22:46:05 Get rid of bump stocks. No good reason for them to exist.
154 2018-05-19 22:45:58 Ban bump stocks NOW!
155 2018-05-19 22:45:50 BAN BUMP STOCKS. Did we learn nothing from the Vegas murders?
156 2018-05-19 22:45:42 Automatic weapons are banned. Semi automatic, which most guns are- aren’t. The bump stocks allow a semi automatic to mimic the trigger fire of an automatic. There’s no reason to use a bump stock on an auto. They’re used to circumvent the ban already in place. Do u see the issue?
157 2018-05-19 22:45:19 Imaginate, le di vuelta los stocks, ah lo bueno que la telefonista me dejo tranquilo porque ne dijo que venian "muchas"
158 2018-05-19 22:45:09 Ban bump stocks, common sense & a conscience is all that is required

172 2018-05-19 22:40:34 You are right but that's not my issue. My problem is the gop won't even do anything. They won't even bsn bump stocks. I promise universal background, required training, storage, safety, and psy exam would save lives. Most new members are for those things
173 2018-05-19 22:40:28 Republicans refuse to die a little for country , it looks their interest is churned into what stocks America can pile up ,racketeer for them .Clamoring for an agent's blood whose interest is to salvage the nation from foreign adversary's treasonous actions .Unpatriotic gluttons
174 2018-05-19 22:39:57 Congress, Please ban bump stocks! Be responsible with our kids! Helen Brewer

177 2018-05-19 22:36:13 Ban Bump Stocks!!
178 2018-05-19 22:35:19 huh, actually if I can sell at BOOTH directly as overseas shipping then I can also sell remaining stocks of Artorius, because my Toranoana sales has ended long ago 
179 2018-05-19 22:35:16 If you can't sell a fully automatic weapon then why is it legal to sell a kit to make a weapon fully automatic? Ban bump stocks!
180 2018-05-19 22:34:38 Did I say I have a bump stock? NO I am all for banning bump stocks!
181 2018-05-19 22:34:34 Ban Bump stocks. Ban assault rifles. Nationalize background checks and install a 30 day wait on all ALL gun purchases. Age -21
182 2018-05-19 22:34:16 Ban bump stocks!
183 2018-05-19 22:33:49 Ban Bump Stocks!
184 2018-05-19 22:32:13 Simple logic would dictate that bump stocks are a bad idea. I would think the simple minds in Congress would get this.
185 2018-05-19 22:32:12 Pain med stocks would spike
186 2018-05-19 22:32:04 Not really. If you use margin opportunistically to get into the right stock or options at the right price and decide to reduce the margin over time thats fine. In stocks especially those that are going to hit a critical growth phase timing is very important to maximize gains.
187 2018-05-19 22:31:49 Let’s start here ... Please ban bump stocks!
188 2018-05-19 22:31:14 Ban bump stocks
189 2018-05-19 22:30:44 Ban bump stocks!  No brained
190 2018-05-19 22:29:56 Just find some garage wines from that year, they're very reasonable prices.  Specific appellations will be dictated by whatever your local 7/11 stocks.
191 2018-05-19 22:29:26 Ban bump stocks. On what planet are they necessary for hunting or self defense.  Pathetic.
192 2018-05-19 22:29:15 My turn; (Things you should know part 1) The assault weapons ban did very little. It did not ban guns as much as it banned stocks, grips, muzzle guards and magazines in an attempt to slow production of guns, which the gun companies very easily worked around those restrictions.
193 2018-05-19 22:29:02 So if guns are banned in the UK, how is it easier to get pistols with stocks in the UK than it is in the US? It's so hard to own in the US that most companies- even Americans won't even try to market them here as in Canada, the UK, or Russia.
194 2018-05-19 22:28:36 I think bringing back the stocks and letting everyone literally throw rotten tomatoes would be suitable.
195 2018-05-19 22:28:05 BAN bump stocks now!
196 2018-05-19 22:27:39 It's time.  Ban the bump stocks.
197 2018-05-19 22:27:36 Hey @NASCAR instead of making these cars slow as shit...put em all in street stocks at a dirt track @Kenny_Wallace
198 2018-05-19 22:27:01 @GoldmanSachs You can dump these stocks any time, large bottles of Hennessy that we don’t open. #indoor rink and mall if required!! @NHL
199 2018-05-19 22:26:53 My fantasy: his perp walk features 24 hours naked, in stocks (with no access to hair & makeup), on 59th and 5th with thousands of people queued up to tell him how horrible he is.
200 2018-05-19 22:25:48 Ban bump stocks

212 2018-05-19 22:18:52 no worries @realDonaldTrump was going to do an executive order DONE all good  bump stocks GONE  hes a man of his word
213 2018-05-19 22:17:51 Without marketization stocks would not be liquid or fungible and that's when it actually only benefits the already wealthy
214 2018-05-19 22:17:11 Wow! @J_Warrington was just ferocious. Just did not see him dominating @leeselby126 with power!

@JoelBrunker stocks just went up I say! 

@ausboxing @ben_damon
215 2018-05-19 22:16:23 Ban bump stocks, suppressors, assault rifles and enact sensible gun laws like longer wait periods, registration of fire arms, mandatory training on each weapon, licencing, loss of right to own a gun for abusers, mentally handicapped, anything is better than nothing.
216 2018-05-19 22:16:14 Yes, we need to ban bump stocks! #BanBumpStocks
217 2018-05-19 22:16:08 Fwiw, middle class denotes more than simply being the median. It means, usually, the difference beteeen owning property or renting, having excess capital (usually invested in stocks — “owning MOP”), etc. Your assertion that there is no overlap between working and owning is wrong.
218 2018-05-19 22:15:50 Ban the bump stocks.
219 2018-05-19 22:15:43 Ban bump stocks. Ban assault type military weapons while you're at it. Been done before.

225 2018-05-19 22:11:38 Ban bump stocks
226 2018-05-19 22:11:24 I own guns, always have. I am completely for more regulations, closing the gun show loophole, banning bump stocks, setting magazine capacity limits. None of that sound like anyone taking my guns. Im certain i can defend my home and family with the average firearms I own.
227 2018-05-19 22:10:51 People are already allowed to buy weapons meant for war, please be sensible and ban bump stocks!

232 2018-05-19 22:08:36 What would be the reason to ban the weapon if bump stocks were banned too?
233 2018-05-19 22:08:30 #BREAKING #Stamford State Rep @WilliamTongCT gets @CTSenateDems nomination for Attorney General. Tong led fight to ban bump stocks this year. But he will face primary challenge from @ChrisMatteiCT (who prosecuted John Rowland) & State Sen @pauldoyle4ct

237 2018-05-19 22:08:07 Trump actually talked about more than any of those other presidents have or politicians. He's banning bump stocks which no other president got done. And he's talked about other gun control measures one was Fix NICS which was in the Omnibus Bill.

240 2018-05-19 22:04:40 Bump stocks and automatic guns should be banned!!!
241 2018-05-19 22:04:38 Ban bump stocks now!
242 2018-05-19 22:04:24 Ban bump stocks now - long overdue!!
243 2018-05-19 22:04:10 Yes, like the shitty penny stocks I owned not long ago: MCTC @ .0025 / DUTV @ .0004 / LDSR @.0002.  Unfarking real runs.   Meanwhile, the good ones languish.
244 2018-05-19 22:03:56 Each school shooting, or mass shooting is on the @NRA until they support the ban of high capacity magazines, bump stocks, more stringent background checks, and the ban of semi automatic carbines like the AR15 family.
245 2018-05-19 22:03:38 Bump stocks should be illegal. Most Americans do not want to ban all guns.
246 2018-05-19 22:03:26 Ban Bump Stocks from all civilian use.
247 2018-05-19 22:03:19 Selinsgrove speedway 360 jack gun mermiol super late models pro stocks roadruners and of cours fierwroks! Soget ready fro great weekend a head
248 2018-05-19 22:03:08 Guns sure do help people kill through. They are not the soul problem but they are for sure part of the problem. I am progun but the lack of common sense the US has with guns is for sure the problem. Things like 100 round drum magazines and bump stocks have no reason to exist.
249 2018-05-19 22:02:51 to us that those same men would castrate them for if done to their other women. You think a bunch of white men would film shit while black men swung on an white woman? Do they realize what laughing stocks they are in the world of men that this happens?
250 2018-05-19 22:02:07 How about MU and AMD, do you see long term potenial in these stocks?
251 2018-05-19 22:01:31 Gun control ASAP bump stocks removed
252 2018-05-19 22:01:26 I expect the experts to read and understand the very careful language I use when I speak about stocks here. I am always clear about there being no guarantees, and the need to research and pick carefully AND follow up your picks.
253 2018-05-19 22:00:33 Ban bump stocks now. 
254 2018-05-19 22:00:27 Bump stocks only make shooting faster easier. They make accurate shooting very hard because the gun basically bounces in your hands.
255 2018-05-19 21:59:28 Stocks options for early morning?
256 2018-05-19 21:59:27 Ban the Bump Stocks!!}!!!
257 2018-05-19 21:58:55 Ban bump stocks!
258 2018-05-19 21:58:02 Steven paddock wasn’t the shooter at Vegas he was the patsy the videos I’ve saw of people using bump stocks you don’t get that many shots of simultaneously they were using machine guns
259 2018-05-19 21:57:34 To be honest, I’m not sure bump stocks were ever illegal because they alone are not considered a weapon. This is ONLY a guess. As for the community, I think you’re right. Change needs to start at the grassroots level. There needs to be an appetite for it. I hope there is. 
260 2018-05-19 21:57:31 Sad, but I know liberals who took all of their money out of the stock portion of their 401k. Because the media said if Trump won the election stocks would go down. Their own media has been screwing them over. No wonder they're so pissed off. They lack critical thinking
261 2018-05-19 21:57:28 Ban the Bump Stocks - Hell ban assault weapons too while you’re at it...
262 2018-05-19 21:57:26 You realize, of course, that bump stocks are not needed to bump fire a semiautomatic firearm.

If you want to stop bump firing, you're going to need to ban thumbs.

Dingbat.
263 2018-05-19 21:56:36 No more bump stocks
264 2018-05-19 21:56:16 Thank you so much for the work you are doing. I support banning bump stocks!
265 2018-05-19 21:55:28 BUMP STOCKS MUST AND WILL BE BANNED! THEY'RE NOT LEGAL FOR LARGE OR SMALL GAME HUNTING!
THEY SURE AS HELL DO NOT NEED TO BE PRODUCED OR MARKETED FOR SALES TO THE PUBLIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
STRAIGHT UP LUDICROUS!
STRAIGHT UP GREED!
NO EXCUSES! NO EXCEPTIONS!!!!!!!!
266 2018-05-19 21:54:18 Bump stocks? Why? Ban them!
267 2018-05-19 21:53:32 Ban bump stocks, pass reasonable gun control laws and stop being NRA whores
268 2018-05-19 21:53:12 Ban bump stocks now.
269 2018-05-19 21:53:12 Ban Bump Stocks! It's the right thing to do!
270 2018-05-19 21:53:11 Ban bump stocks
271 2018-05-19 21:52:50 100 mass shootings since January all will the AR-15 semi automatic rifle.

1 mass shooting with a shotgun, what's your point?

Plus, bump stocks are STILL available to turn those semi-auto rifles into "full" automatic (take Vegas for example)
272 2018-05-19 21:52:30 Bump stocks should be outlawed... no valid reason to own one.... the only purpose is to enable a rifle to become a weapon of mass slaughter....
273 2018-05-19 21:52:09 Family member or friend, weapons like the AR-15, bump stocks, high cap mags, etc, should not be allowed for civilian purposes at all.
274 2018-05-19 21:51:30 Ban Bump Stocks! #GunControlNow
275 2018-05-19 21:51:27 whereas my local b&n stocks neither the author nor his books. *sobs*
276 2018-05-19 21:51:24 Ban bump stocks NOW!
277 2018-05-19 21:50:52 Oh please!! Why were bump stocks ever legal to begin with???
If auto weapons are banned, then how did a device that turns semi’s into autos become legal?
My money is on the NRA.
278 2018-05-19 21:50:49 Ban bump stocks and all online sales of firearms.
279 2018-05-19 21:50:37 So delusional.... We don't want to take away the second amendment,  we want common sense gun laws, ban bumper stocks,  and AR15'S. Nothing else... perhaps, if you watched something other than Fox news you might learn something.

281 2018-05-19 21:49:55 And the army would scoff at bump stocks.
282 2018-05-19 21:49:49 Why do you want to ban bump stocks?  What did my bump stock do to you?  Who is going to confiscate my bump stock from me?
283 2018-05-19 21:49:15 Ban Bump Stocks
284 2018-05-19 21:48:32 Banning bump stocks is a great beginnng but just the tip of the ice berg
285 2018-05-19 21:48:20 Did he? (Serious question) I think (?) that bump stocks were legalized during his administration. Trump outlawed them. But I'm still afraid that itll take a community.  Not the federal level.
286 2018-05-19 21:48:08 Ban bump stocks
287 2018-05-19 21:47:09 Ban bump stocks - many girlfriends in Vegas almost killed!
288 2018-05-19 21:47:02 Ban the bump stocks. If you don't them just admit that you are bought and sold by the NRA.

290 2018-05-19 21:46:21 My liquor stocks are back to nominal. One of these days, though, I will have a proper bar with room to store plenty of different bottles and at least 2 kegs of beer on tap.
291 2018-05-19 21:45:29 Ignoring matchup-specific reasons, for characters like Marcina who are neutral heavy characters: Is the possibility of ending stocks earlier occasionally (Marth) of more value than the consistency of your hits and punishes (Lucina)? I always think about this and I just don't know
292 2018-05-19 21:44:27 Ban bump stocks NOW!!!! End this madness!!!
293 2018-05-19 21:43:03 UNITED FELLOWSHIP stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
294 2018-05-19 21:42:24 Ban bump stocks
295 2018-05-19 21:41:53 There is absolutely no reason for bump stocks that overrides the safety of innocent people.
296 2018-05-19 21:41:41 When u see how many done even know the basics of what a practical investment involves, but know every term attributed to Buffet. Don't know the costs around just buying stocks, but can parrot the obvious "Grace, NCB, Seprod..." etc etc. Nah, not much respect to be gotten from me.
297 2018-05-19 21:40:58 Banning bump stocks? How about putting all your energy into making schools safer overall? Ryan petty has the right idea..bump stocks are on their way out anyway, stop wasting your time
298 2018-05-19 21:39:57 Ban bump stocks
299 2018-05-19 21:39:50 Do we love our guns more than we love our children? We need to do something. Start somewhere. Bump stocks need to go.
300 2018-05-19 21:39:26 I’m just ready for Monday! Once I win with stocks I can find and marry a queen too!
301 2018-05-19 21:38:46 This is a simple one people.  Ban bump stocks now.
302 2018-05-19 21:38:08 Bump stocks are unnecessary. Ban bump stocks.
303 2018-05-19 21:37:45 Ban bump stocks.
304 2018-05-19 21:37:38 Criminalize bump stocks!
305 2018-05-19 21:36:23 It was the bho regime that allowed bump stocks during it occupation of the White House.
306 2018-05-19 21:35:36 Ban bump stocks and assault rifles!
307 2018-05-19 21:35:12 This is really a flawed statistic though. Think about some me who’s retiring soon vs people our age. If they’ve been putting money in their 401k for 40 years they are in the richest 10% I would assume, and a huge portion of their assets are in stocks.
308 2018-05-19 21:34:42 Trying to diversify? Try these Hamilton stocks!
309 2018-05-19 21:34:13 Ban bump stocks. Thank you for all u do David. Ur voice is needed. Ur voice and ur other classmates, is a miracle in the tragedies of school shootings.
310 2018-05-19 21:34:07 007 tries to stop an enigmatic businessman, who is planning to use super-bacteria to distribute stocks.
311 2018-05-19 21:33:53 Bump stocks belong in the trash like the NRA
312 2018-05-19 21:33:32 The military uses full auto. We should have bump stocks and full auto. With the right background checks, permits, and money to pay for it I'm cool with legalizing everything.
313 2018-05-19 21:33:28 bump stocks are easly made. a spring with a 2x4 on the end works. laws only work if you can enforce them

315 2018-05-19 21:31:48 Bump stocks are on the way out anyway and the last school shooting was with a shot gun not an AR-15 and I don't know if he was a Republican or not.  When are we going to blame the one who pulls the trigger?
316 2018-05-19 21:31:43 Military doesn’t use bump stocks. But if that’s what you want then advocate for fully automatic weapons be legalized and made readily available.  However, as a vet, I don’t think full auto is going to even the scales. You need to legalize Stinger missiles, tanks, Apache choppers.
317 2018-05-19 21:30:52 Lmao stocks 
318 2018-05-19 21:30:17 Socks or stocks ....
319 2018-05-19 21:30:04 Ban bump stocks
320 2018-05-19 21:29:05 they dont come very often and when they do its hard to find out what it will be. honestly small but consistant gains are going to become the way to go as the markets grow into a level like stocks and shares
321 2018-05-19 21:28:44 Easy strategy: Buy tech that is banned

Countries ban what is threatening. You want to own things with that potential. For perspective, China banned pretty much all the FANG stocks and Bitcoin...pretty decent investments over past 5 years.
322 2018-05-19 21:28:40 Ban bump stocks!  No brainer
323 2018-05-19 21:28:38 There is no justification for bump stocks or semi automatic weapons unless you are in the military, active, and deployed.
324 2018-05-19 21:27:39 In #America, They are free to stockpile weapons. They’re free to order ammo online. They’re free to outfit their guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price they’re paying for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn. #SantaFeSchoolShooting

334 2018-05-19 21:24:33 Who dreams about stocks when u can dream of socks
335 2018-05-19 21:24:14 Agreed, but, also ban ARs, bump stocks, extended magazines... for starters.
336 2018-05-19 21:24:09 In America,They are free to stockpile weapons They’re free to order ammo online They’re free to outfit their guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did.This is the price they’re paying for freedom alright.freedom to not give a damn. #StopGunViolence #SantaFeSchoolShooting
337 2018-05-19 21:24:05 It's just another semi automatic rifle. The military appearance makes it a focus of the gun discussion but theres really no reason. I am in favor of eliminating high capacity magazine and bump stocks. Make a registry of people convicted of DV or animal abuse, can't own can't buy
338 2018-05-19 21:23:05 Get rid of bump stocks and all assault rifles!
339 2018-05-19 21:22:59 How is it infringing on the second amendment?
It's not taking all guns away. It's limiting the ammunition you're allowed to have for a gun, making sure it remains in a safe so kids can't steal and use them, attachments like Bump Stocks are unnecessarily dangerous, as are semiauto
340 2018-05-19 21:22:56 Ban Bump stocks!
341 2018-05-19 21:22:51 His rants have already made stocks in Amazon plummet. I never truly knew what hate was until this d-bag became President. I hope he falls so big, he never wants to show his face again.
342 2018-05-19 21:22:40 Ban bump stocks
343 2018-05-19 21:22:26 Ban bump stocks
344 2018-05-19 21:22:21 $JAGX RS is the life support of stocks.
345 2018-05-19 21:21:59 A person cannot tell another person what they can or cannot defend their home with. Also Bump stocks are trash!!! Only people that own bump stocks are the ones who can't shoot straight or they wanna waste their ammo
346 2018-05-19 21:21:47 Liberals egotism to think they only thinking that is valid is theirs. is about egotism . 
Some  see weapons & ammo stores as  an investment like some see buying stocks
347 2018-05-19 21:21:12 The city of Denver passed an ordinance against bump stocks in October after the Vegas shooting. Seven and a half months later they've confiscated ZERO bump stocks. We need ways to enforce this, not politicians passing hypothetical legislation.
348 2018-05-19 21:20:50 Yes yes yes! Ban bump stocks, ban guns, do something to stop the violence.
349 2018-05-19 21:20:36 Professor Fox, you make many good points. But nothing you say here affects the need to have reasonable gun safety rules consistent with the Second Amendment, including universal background checks, and a ban on bump stocks, assault rifles and large capacity magazines.
350 2018-05-19 21:20:15 I am so sorry for the trauma, and losses you, and children like you , have suffered. I support your efforts to motivate new voters to vote for new leadership, who are committed to changing gun laws,and support your efforts to ban bump stocks.#BanBumpStocks
351 2018-05-19 21:19:52 Ban bump stocks.  I thought Republicans and Democrats agreed on this.  Why the delay?
352 2018-05-19 21:18:30 Ban bump stocks.
353 2018-05-19 21:18:07 No need for bump stocks.
354 2018-05-19 21:17:03 “Trump Rally: Stocks and distorted key facts”
355 2018-05-19 21:16:54 Ban bump stocks!
356 2018-05-19 21:16:43 Ban bump stocks!
357 2018-05-19 21:16:42 Yes! Ban bump stocks!
358 2018-05-19 21:16:36 Ban bump stocks!
359 2018-05-19 21:16:29 Ban bump stocks now if not yesterday
360 2018-05-19 21:16:22 It’s time to ban bump stocks!!! #BanBumpStocks
361 2018-05-19 21:15:43 Master David Hogg, can you explain to me why you want to ban bump stocks?  Personally, I have no use for them and consider them a fad and a good way to waste ammunition without hitting the target.  They are unreliable and a total waste of money as well.
362 2018-05-19 21:15:20 The democrats were in charge for 8 years and nothing was done.... bump stocks were passed during Obama, some of the most violent cities in the U.S. are in Democratic control,  what part of this is unclear?
363 2018-05-19 21:15:20 Keep up the fight, I stand with you, ban bump stocks!
364 2018-05-19 21:15:20 Ban bump stocks
365 2018-05-19 21:14:26 Ban bump stocks !
366 2018-05-19 21:14:01 i think i'm officially an adult.

i had a dream about buying stocks
367 2018-05-19 21:13:56 Ban bump stocks now
368 2018-05-19 21:13:39 Ban bump stocks. Voices should be amplified, not killing machines
369 2018-05-19 21:13:29 I of course see your point(s).... I am at a loss.... the laws/regulations are not working.... I guess that the ONLY thing to do is to properly enforce the regulations already in place.... Am I okay with the sale bump stocks and AR 15 or whatever being sold... no
370 2018-05-19 21:13:25 Ban bump stocks
371 2018-05-19 21:13:15 Ban bump stocks #banbumpstocks
372 2018-05-19 21:12:30 Ban bump stocks!
373 2018-05-19 21:12:27 Ban bump stocks.
374 2018-05-19 21:12:11 Make this a litmus test for your vote. Don't allow NRA, high cap. Mags, bump stocks or background checks in the conversation. Tell them either support funding for armed personnel, metal detectors and single entry point, or their opponent gets your vote. TELL THEM TO DO SOMETHING.
375 2018-05-19 21:11:52 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons
376 2018-05-19 21:11:38 If doors are outlawed only outlaws will have doors. 

At least until some door company neatly circumvents the legislation with some skeezy bullshit like “tall  windows” or “bump fire stocks.”
377 2018-05-19 21:11:26 I agree with every one of these and I’ve never heard anyone besides myself call stocks a Ponzi scheme. 
How can half a companies value evaporate over night?
378 2018-05-19 21:10:56 Flush out your headgear, Cammie. President @realDonaldTrump proposed significant improvements to NICS reporting, banned bump stocks--which I opposed & wants to fortify our schools so they are not free fire ones anymore. Stop listening to democrats; they're lying to you.
379 2018-05-19 21:10:52 Ban bump stocks
380 2018-05-19 21:10:35 No one needs bump stocks.
381 2018-05-19 21:10:32 Support ban on bump stocks, automatic weapons,  large magazines...and trump.
382 2018-05-19 21:09:57 As a liberal with a working knowledge of guns, I plan on creating a talking points list with arguments to refute the anti-gun control crowd. They wouldn't be desperately coming up with excuses like belt loops being able to sub in for bump stocks, if they worked nearly as well.
383 2018-05-19 21:09:27 Ban bump stocks
384 2018-05-19 21:09:22 Ban Bump Stocks Now!
385 2018-05-19 21:08:59 Ban bump stocks...and assault style weapons
386 2018-05-19 21:08:55 Updating stocks all the time, growing new varieties as well. so keep an eye on me.
387 2018-05-19 21:08:49 Ban bump stocks. Enact sensible gun control. Put people > money GOP!
388 2018-05-19 21:08:48 Ban bump stocks

391 2018-05-19 21:07:53 @Amber_Stocks great win on today that was a well played game keep up the good work
392 2018-05-19 21:07:51 Yes. Ban bump stocks.
393 2018-05-19 21:07:39 *BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW*
394 2018-05-19 21:07:20 Show me one person who is not affiliated with military/security that owns any of the weapons you stated that are FULLY ARMED & OPERATIONAL. The gov. limiting weapons we are allowed to own is nothing new. Could easily ban semi-auto rifles, handguns, bump stocks, high cap. mags etc
395 2018-05-19 21:07:08 Standing with our youth! Ban Bump Stocks NOW !
396 2018-05-19 21:06:08 So your solution is more guns? Let’s try outlawing guns. It works everywhere else. But NRA has fought outlawing bump stocks, raising legal buying age to 21, and any other common sense law that would at least bring the control to the level of cars.
397 2018-05-19 21:06:00 Stuff is starting to change thanks to the movement started by @davidhogg111 @Sarahchadwickk @Emma4Change and others, starting by states only a few now but more and more are considering and or voting for change and bans on ARs, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. Best way to
398 2018-05-19 21:04:05 You can bump stocks? This sounds like a dance. Do tell more. 
399 2018-05-19 21:03:27 Enough is Enough! Ban bump stocks! #BanBumpStocks
400 2018-05-19 21:03:21 The guns in Texas and Parkland were legally bought guns. Actually I believe most school shootings have been w/ legally purchased guns with legally purchased bump stocks so your logic is flawed. The @NRA uses fear that your rights are being stolen. Not true. #AmericasChildrenFirst
401 2018-05-19 21:03:09 Please do something! Ban bump stocks now! Our children are dying.
402 2018-05-19 21:02:13 I’m with you. Ban bump stocks
403 2018-05-19 21:01:45 I agree Bump stocks should be banned

405 2018-05-19 21:00:36 I submitted a comment to support outlawing bump stocks. I hope all of you will too.
406 2018-05-19 21:00:23 Ban bump stocks and assault rifles. They are not used for hunting animals, only people.
407 2018-05-19 21:00:14 Bump stocks have only military and tactical applications they should be banned from use by private citizens.
408 2018-05-19 20:59:36 Ban bump stocks!
409 2018-05-19 20:59:29 Enough is Enough Bernie.... you need to stop with the political bullshit. Please enlighten all of us on what legislation would have stopped this horrific tragedy? There were no AR-15 style weapons, no "excessive" ammo clips, no bump stocks. What legislation could stop a 17 y/o?
410 2018-05-19 20:59:26 break down stocks are not a feature that civilians should have.

long guns are called that for a reason. they don't fit into a carry on bag or backpack

they "stick out" and are then more visible to merchants, law enforcement, or transportation providers.

as it should be.
411 2018-05-19 20:58:31 Ban, Ban, Ban bump stocks
412 2018-05-19 20:58:30 Made a milli off of stocks I ain’t gotta work nomore
413 2018-05-19 20:57:15 Dr., Cannabis is great but it's not going to fix addiction. People that are addicted have their favorites being uppers, downers, tranqs., etc. Being T2 diabetic, if I ingest THC my wife stocks healthy food in the house or my B.S. is of control. Munchies LOL #PainandPsychosis
414 2018-05-19 20:56:40 NO guns of ANY kind should sold to anyone under 21. A 3-day waiting period should be required. Unlicensed gun shows/sales should be banned. No gun/rifle should carry more than 10 rounds. Ban bump-stocks, you jack-asses. Create an accessible national database of background checks.
415 2018-05-19 20:56:03 So what happens if I lose the private key to my stocks? Do I no longer own it? What if I send my house token to the wrong address? Does that person now own my house?
416 2018-05-19 20:55:55 Ban bump stocks today.  My kid is more important than your gun.
417 2018-05-19 20:55:46 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons!
418 2018-05-19 20:55:24 That's because you're not buying or selling large amounts of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was really liquid nobody would care about the Mt Gox guy. And you wouldn't have daily candles of 5% in price. That doesn't happen with stocks.
419 2018-05-19 20:55:21 12 bump fire stocks identified on the desk on the fairness issue. Not one jot.
420 2018-05-19 20:55:17 There is no reason for bump stocks to exist, period.
421 2018-05-19 20:53:42 $GLUU $PENN $XXII how do I find stocks that can double like these? put in the work.  just finished analyzing 200 charts; 18 made the cut!
422 2018-05-19 20:53:35 Already done! Ban bump stocks!
423 2018-05-19 20:52:28 Come on think about it, here in CT, ARs were banned when during the same year they were used in less than 3% of homocides. Adjustable stocks for my little .22 rifle are banned. Is this the “reasonable” regulation we need? No. Again, its dishonest and agenda driven
424 2018-05-19 20:52:19 Bump stocks don't kill people.  Banning might make you feel good.  Won't stop people from killing each other.
425 2018-05-19 20:52:08 Bump stocks make the recoil of the weapon easier to control which is how people can pull the trigger so fast. You can't physically make a weapon fully auto by adding a stock.
426 2018-05-19 20:50:31 Ryan. The NRA & republicans hav not/will not make it harder for people 2get killing machine weapons. What’s wrong w/ a little common sense reform & regulation? I’m all 4 the right 2 bear arms,but there is no constitutional protection 4 semi automatic / bump stocks kill machines.
427 2018-05-19 20:50:23 Ban bump stocks and expand background checks!!
428 2018-05-19 20:49:25 Tokenising makes a lot more sense when you compare say ERC-20 tokens to stocks and shares of the legacy stock market. 

Not sure why you argue against that. Yes blockchain is generally a slow and inefficient database. Which is why you wouldn’t use it for data storage etc
429 2018-05-19 20:48:58 Ban bump stocks now & put the lives of children first.
430 2018-05-19 20:48:55 Oh yes what are we waiting for . We need to ban all the
Bump stocks and all the assault weapons. Again the politicians in Texas are going to devote their entire thing me to make sure that this tragedy never happens again. 
We need to vote out the NRA republicans.
431 2018-05-19 20:48:50 An all machine guns, including those made full auto by addition of bump stocks.  Ban the bump!
432 2018-05-19 20:48:36 Politics was wrote since salmonella stocks ??
433 2018-05-19 20:48:03 Bump stocks should be banned...
434 2018-05-19 20:47:46 All states should ban bump stocks just like Massachusetts has done.
435 2018-05-19 20:47:43 Look at a video of someone using a bump stock.  They hold the trigger down and bullets continuously fire.  If you could manually pull the trigger that fast then you literally wouldn’t need or have a market for bump stocks.
436 2018-05-19 20:47:11 Also it is extremely rare for citizens to have assault weapons. Most AR-15s are semi auto unless illegally modified. Bump stocks should be illegal. Usually AR 15s shoot .22 rounds as well. Just at a higher velocity because of the rifling.
437 2018-05-19 20:46:36 The attack occurred with a revolver and sawed off. No magazines, bump stocks, rifles or other bogeys that gun hating advocates rail against. Background check? He never bought a firearm. Stop trying to use tragedy as an excuse punish legal gun ownership.
438 2018-05-19 20:46:01 Ban the stocks
439 2018-05-19 20:45:18 They registered with bump stocks.
The scratched ones wouldn't pass like a bus stop.
440 2018-05-19 20:44:36 Ban bump stocks.
441 2018-05-19 20:44:09 Does anyone understand that banning bump stocks will do absolutely nothing? This is just political theater by children.
442 2018-05-19 20:43:47 Yep. And this instant bubble reflation is unprecedented even when it was done before. Japan's interest rates were driven down post bubble & then QE too. Their real estate still hasn't moved. And its stocks didn't move for decades either.
443 2018-05-19 20:43:15 When your local music shop special stocks your @jimdunlopusa pick of choice, just for you 
444 2018-05-19 20:43:05 Ban bump stocks. Don’t ban semi-automatics, just the military style popular with killers.
445 2018-05-19 20:42:19 Ban bump stocks!!!!
446 2018-05-19 20:41:35 Time overdue to take action on assault weapons including bump stocks
447 2018-05-19 20:41:18 Let's ban bump stocks.  Guns are dangerous enough without letting the general public fire so many rounds so quickly.  Please act on this Congress.  Please.  Thank you.
448 2018-05-19 20:41:12 Stop bump stocks, save our children.
449 2018-05-19 20:40:28 The majority of Americans support a ban for bump stocks; since when did America cease to be a democracy? I guess since the majority of Congress became NRA whores more concerned with selling guns than saving children's lives. 
450 2018-05-19 20:40:22 Bump stocks need to go immediately!!

460 2018-05-19 20:35:37 Yes. Ban bump stocks. Let's not make it easier to fire more rounds.
461 2018-05-19 20:35:10 Their only purpose is to make a semi-auto function like a full-auto.  Full auto weapons are banned specifically because of that functionality.  Ergo, bump stocks should be banned.  What’s the case for not banning them?
462 2018-05-19 20:35:04 Ban bump stocks
463 2018-05-19 20:34:34 PLEASE , We need a ban on bump stocks.
464 2018-05-19 20:34:33 Banning bump stocks is the least we can do

466 2018-05-19 20:31:27 Don't bother.
- Subject was original bump stocks
- The goal post got moved
- Trump won't use his pen and phone
- The goal post got moved
- It will move again
467 2018-05-19 20:30:21 Ban bump stocks, all assault rifles (except to law enforcement) and all oversize magazines !!
468 2018-05-19 20:30:00 Get rid of these bump stocks. They are just filling machines
469 2018-05-19 20:29:41 Most ppl that have 10k sitting are not investing in stocks hedge funds etc..they keep it in a bank and want quick access for a potential 'Rainy day'. Yes, they might decide tosave in cryptos..but this wont change consumerism
470 2018-05-19 20:29:40 not me, saw Trump coming a mile away. DNC will get stuff back just in time for escalating interest rates, cycle from stocks to interest bearing dividends, housing reset and the rest of Trump’s affect to hold for dems to take blame the GOP will take back power and finish up
471 2018-05-19 20:28:55 Ban bump stocks.
472 2018-05-19 20:28:20 There is no rational or moral justification for bump stocks.
473 2018-05-19 20:28:09 Wealthy Manhattanites buy and sell stocks and bonds and also tell their therapists their troubles. They trade securities and they share insecurities.

476 2018-05-19 20:25:49 Liar! You don't care! You have done nothing to stop this from happening over & over! Change the gun laws! Stop supporting the terrorist NRA! Ban semi-automatic, silencers & bump stocks, increase background checks, ban carry laws!
477 2018-05-19 20:25:05 Let’s Ban Bump Stocks Already!
478 2018-05-19 20:24:45 Yeah i have one etf right now. “Xly” is the stock name. Havent put any money in stocks for quite a while tho cause were getting ready to buy a house :p
479 2018-05-19 20:24:12 Ban bump stocks
480 2018-05-19 20:23:56 Bump stocks had nothing to do with Parkland or Sante Fe.  There needs to be a complete overhaul on how schools are secured.   It starts first when someone is reported as a potential risk that the authorities take the complaint seriously and investigate the situation.
481 2018-05-19 20:23:50 Ban Assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Mandatory waiting period. Magazine limits. Raise the age for purchase of all guns to 21. Do something MEANINGFUL to solve the problem! Prayers are nice but PRAYERS DON’T STOP MASS SHOOTINGS. #SantaFeHighSchool #MSDStrong #WeStandTogether
482 2018-05-19 20:23:29 Ban the production and manufacturing of bump stocks. Period.

485 2018-05-19 20:22:12 As it creates a way for bullying to get beyond schools. It’s like you can not escape bullies even at home. But that is my opinion. I can not support banning a gun, I can support banning bump stocks, background checks, and maybe changing the age limit for a semi auto weapon.
486 2018-05-19 20:21:39 Ban bump stocks.
487 2018-05-19 20:21:35 Bump stocks are completely unnecessary! BAN THEM!!
488 2018-05-19 20:21:34 “Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks...the NRA is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.” Wanna keep attacking them, jackass?
489 2018-05-19 20:20:37 Ban bump stocks, just like we banned lawn darts and many other stupid things that kill people!

492 2018-05-19 20:19:43 there’s been a school shooter that obtained and owned an AR 15 legally... he was either 17 or 19 but either way it shouldn’t matter. why the fuck does he need that? especially with bump stocks?? what purpose does that serve other than to kill. it’s Unnecessary

We have to get the facts right to understand the true nature of the problem. 

This event would not have been stopped by banning AR-15’s, or high capacity magazines, or bump stocks.

(1/2)
497 2018-05-19 20:16:48 Ban bump stocks. By the way, I do vote.
498 2018-05-19 20:16:23 There is no reason for bump stocks to be available.  They serve no other purpose but to make killing easier.
499 2018-05-19 20:16:23 Bump stocks don’t kill people.
500 2018-05-19 20:16:05 Ban them. Zero reason for civilians to have bump stocks.
501 2018-05-19 20:15:59 Ban bump stocks now!
502 2018-05-19 20:15:57 Don't know the guy, but I suspect that he cares more about the Future of #CBS  than his employment there. Also if fired he will receive a golden parachute of 150 Million, with stocks that could balloon to a 300 Million Dollar severance package. So Les and Jules are gonna be ok
503 2018-05-19 20:15:48 Bump stocks need to go. There is no reason anyone needs them except to cause mass suffering. Thank you to the Parklamd students and parents for their persistence - and the rest of us need to step-up.
504 2018-05-19 20:15:30 ban bump stocks - NO BRAINER congress ffs
505 2018-05-19 20:14:58 Ban bump stocks, & assault weapons.  Require background checks.  Common sense gun control NOW!

507 2018-05-19 20:13:57 I know there has been talk about banning bump stocks which I believe even the NRA supports. But if a semi-automatic can be converted into a fully automatic that sounds like an assault weapon because of its potential to be turned into one.
508 2018-05-19 20:13:42 Forget MSG stock...buy SHOP, IQ, OLED (at a discount now) SQ and TTWO. These are all high growth stocks in booming industries.

515 2018-05-19 20:11:14 Bump stocks Responsible for 10 deaths or handguns responsible for 7000+??? It’s terrible how the public education system failed you.
516 2018-05-19 20:11:13 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
517 2018-05-19 20:10:33 Common sense  "Ban bump stocks" ... we all looked around and said Ok not a tear was shed for common sense Lunacy will not be tolerated however :)
518 2018-05-19 20:10:27 Introduce a bill on Monday with just 3 provisions:
     1.  Ban bump stocks. 
     2.  Must be 25 to buy an assault style weapon.
     3.  Any assault rifle purchase must be documented...no exceptions.

This is certainly "humanly possible ".  Let's see what you're made of!
519 2018-05-19 20:10:23 I’m not here to entertain any fuckeries . I simply post my  stocks . Don’t like it move on Ight . Respect y’all self ...

522 2018-05-19 20:09:06 Ban bump stocks immediately!
523 2018-05-19 20:08:57 Faux Pas? I know where you can get the real deal - genuine pas, at a good price, limited stocks.
524 2018-05-19 20:08:04 The 1A was made when we only had the printing press. 

Muskets were the same guns the mulitary had back then. Now the military has fully automatic weapons so American's should have them too. (Bump stocks don't make guns full auto BTW) 

Guns keep the peace.
525 2018-05-19 20:07:38 I really don’t get why this is so hard to do?! Ban bump stocks sensible gun control. And make our schools safer!!!!!!!
526 2018-05-19 20:06:34 I’m just glad capital punishment is a thing of the past. And the stocks.

538 2018-05-19 20:01:34 Bump stocks are no more relevant than the NRA. Ban them!
539 2018-05-19 20:01:20 Ban bump stocks but don’t stop there.
540 2018-05-19 20:01:08 If u want to buy WHEN the market sees first sale..be my guest..the price will then be much higher.
We know it works and buy BEFORE ravenue and before the market starts buying all stocks they can get
541 2018-05-19 19:59:38 #BanBumpStocks- It is past time to ban bump stocks! Washington state will ban manufacture & sale them beginning July 1! They will be illegal to own in 2019. I hope other states follow suit, but ban ownership earlier than 2019.
542 2018-05-19 19:59:36 The fact that bump stocks are a 'win' is depressing. We need to stop having to accept scratching, clawing and fighting for THE LEAST we could possibly get in terms of policy.
543 2018-05-19 19:59:36 Ban bump stocks!
544 2018-05-19 19:58:52 Bump stocks are completely unnecessary. And how many in Vegas were hit or killed by bump stocks? The killer thinks it’s cool... Do you?
545 2018-05-19 19:56:18 Ban Bump Stocks!
546 2018-05-19 19:55:59 So when the Democrats controlled the white house and both houses,  the only thing they did was make bump stocks legal and give guns to Mexico. 

The Democrats will never solve the gun problem because they can use it as a way to attack their political opponents.
547 2018-05-19 19:55:44 So proud that CT just banned bump stocks!!
548 2018-05-19 19:55:23 Ban bump stocks. Now!!
549 2018-05-19 19:54:50 No, I'm not. The subject matter is Bump Stocks.
Let Congress do its job without intervention by... ANYONE.
Otherwise, we don't need them, the Judiciary that upholds those laws, or a COTUS that's the basis of said laws.
You're pathetic. Go away.
550 2018-05-19 19:54:14 I agree stocks are way over valued, I really struggle to find anything I like now so I’m mostly cash. On the other hand years of investing has taught me you never really know for sure. The economy is so complex with so many moving parts... just look RE here!
551 2018-05-19 19:53:29 What is special about Royal wedding ??? Why media and people going ga ga over it. Move on ... someone is getting married that is pretty much it #RoyalWedding live
552 2018-05-19 19:53:19 Hillary has ties to george soros and russia! This should worry everyone in USA these 2 fund most groups that are causing racial hatred in USA !
They are funding all the marches by anti gun protests at same time buying stocks in companys to make money off their deaths!
553 2018-05-19 19:53:02 - Stop our fishing stocks being depleted
- Innovate with GM crops
- Keep medical trials here
All because of badly-designed EU law. There's also a wider principle here, a relatively opaque and undemocratic body just shouldn't be able to override British law.
554 2018-05-19 19:52:18 Keep speaking out keep the pressure on NO MORE BUMP STOCKS
555 2018-05-19 19:52:10 Ban Bump Stocks... save a life

563 2018-05-19 19:50:04 Bump stocks weren't around When the Constitution was written. How do we know that they wanted to include bump stocks and our current weapons of war?
564 2018-05-19 19:49:57 Then why are you going bananas (not an apple) over Bump Stocks, of which you REFUSE to acknowledge:
1) Trump Supports The Ban
2) Trump doesn't control Congress
565 2018-05-19 19:49:10 NRA stocks just went up again
566 2018-05-19 19:49:07 So NK has given up all their warheads? All their stocks of enriched isotopes? Destroyed their centrifuges? Decommissioned their reactors? I must have missed all that.

570 2018-05-19 19:48:00 Bio-metric trigger locks on all guns
Federally required universal background checks
Outlaw bump stocks
Federal universal licenses that have to be renewed & include a written & tactile test
571 2018-05-19 19:47:19 Issue is you don't need bump stocks to make weapons more powerful.  There are other ways so this ban would be pointless.
572 2018-05-19 19:47:04 Stocks up- military strength- global respect- cut waste- America first- trade deals- crime down- border protection- jobs jobs jobs- unemployment rate down- you want more? Winning is singular,1 @ a time-i dont think you know what you are talking about- try again.

575 2018-05-19 19:45:39 What a crybaby. Contrary to your own belief, the majority of gun owners want gun control, and don't own guns with bump stocks or AK's.
576 2018-05-19 19:45:30 I have been asking you to share your knowledge, you Resist every time! BTW, supporting a ban on bump stocks, does nothing without action. No laws have been passed on this. Trump has the capacity to put action to his words. He hasn’t

Republicans have already made up their minds.
Vote "YES" to Question 1 on Democratic Party Primary election ballot!
596 2018-05-19 19:39:26 we know about NRA political donations.

BUT we don't know about $ politicians/their spouses have made for yrs from dividends, stock buybacks, stocks owned/sold - of companies that sell, design, mfg, export, import guns, ammunition, etc.

why is that?
who will give us that info?

Step 1: Vote out ALL LAWMAKERS who accept money from the gun lobby.
Step 2: Pass universal background checks. 
Step 3: Ban assault weapons. 
Step 4: Ban bump stocks.
Step 5: Raise legal firearm purchase age to 21.

608 2018-05-19 19:37:29 Bump stocks should have never been allowed to begin with, BAN them
609 2018-05-19 19:37:13 Banning Bump stocks is the very least you can do Congress. Then you can all pat yourselfs on the back to say you finally acted.

655 2018-05-19 19:25:32 No need to ban bump stocks!
656 2018-05-19 19:25:14 Bump stocks are dangerous and unnecessary

659 2018-05-19 19:24:13 If you’re hunting, your target is unarmed. The only time for a weapon to be fired like an automatic is in war. Give peace a chance. Ban bump stocks.
660 2018-05-19 19:24:02 Any website or app that provides stock specific golden cross over and death cross alerts? (50 DMA crossover with 200 DMA) For Indian stocks. As in you set an alert for a stock and you get an email the day the crossover happens?
661 2018-05-19 19:23:39 Ban B. S. Ban bump stocks.
662 2018-05-19 19:23:28 Ban Bump Stocks.

664 2018-05-19 19:23:07 Ban bump stocks
665 2018-05-19 19:23:04 I thought Trump said he DID ban bump stocks? Can we not take him at his word? Ha
666 2018-05-19 19:22:43 Ban bump stocks!
667 2018-05-19 19:22:31 Ban bump stocks
668 2018-05-19 19:22:06 Yes we need to ban bump stocks, they have been proven to be deadly to the general population.
669 2018-05-19 19:21:18 You know....there were school shooting before the Trump administration. In fact....obama legalized bump stocks. Just another piece of the obama legacy erased and set straight by President Trump.
670 2018-05-19 19:21:13 Thank you and ban bump stocks
671 2018-05-19 19:21:02 Ban bump stocks!
672 2018-05-19 19:20:31 lol I think you should have stayed in school and learned sentence structure.

Oh and no...twitter comments will not lead to banning of bump stocks. If you knew anything you would already know the GOP is trying to ban them.  But you knew that already.... @davidhogg111
673 2018-05-19 19:19:28 De toute manière ça va se finir en #GreveGenerale ...
faites des stocks de nourriture, ce gouvernement ne semble pas vouloir négocier, il campe sur ses positions.
674 2018-05-19 19:19:11 The guy has already made moves to ban bump stocks and stricter gun laws just takes months to pass the bill what did Obama do?
675 2018-05-19 19:18:36 If comments will do any good, here's mine - ban bump stocks. Ban assault weapons. Tighten gun control laws. Please.
676 2018-05-19 19:18:25 Ban bump stocks!
677 2018-05-19 19:18:24 Dude, my man Leo bodied your stocks last game. You guys definately had it but whatever, 2nd place is still cool. Hope you do great in singles ad well!!
678 2018-05-19 19:17:21 Ban bump stocks
679 2018-05-19 19:16:57 How many deaths does it take? Ban bump stocks today.
680 2018-05-19 19:16:57 "no money. No stocks, as Citizens realize their being barred from their money riots will erupt it's gonna get really bad really quickly

But we knew this would happen a long time ago. Worst of it, won't technically be illegal.Because their quietly laid the ground work for years"
681 2018-05-19 19:16:41 Done. Bump-fire stocks should be banned nationwide, perhaps by including them in the ATF's definition of "machine gun". At least several states have now banned them. Change is coming to cut #gunviolence.
682 2018-05-19 19:16:38 Protect our children. Ban bump stocks. Make life matter.
683 2018-05-19 19:16:24 Ban bump stocks!
684 2018-05-19 19:15:36 Bump bump stocks to hell
685 2018-05-19 19:15:34 Definitely ban bump stocks.
686 2018-05-19 19:15:07 @senrobportman Can't even commit to making bump stocks illegal? How about any other reasonable gun control regulations? Now school shootings are so frequent as to be normalized. Yours and your fellow Republican's leadership has pretty much ruined this nation in so many ways.
687 2018-05-19 19:14:51 Until this year I had never heard of bump stocks - from up here in Canada, where we have gun control laws.
688 2018-05-19 19:14:05 It is past time to ban bump stocks. My vote will make a difference!
689 2018-05-19 19:14:03 Ban Bump Stocks!
690 2018-05-19 19:13:45 My comment was there is an evil spirit with these guns and bump stocks and the people who own them. Please ban them.
691 2018-05-19 19:13:44 ban bump stocks
692 2018-05-19 19:13:12 Get rid of the bump stocks yesterday.
693 2018-05-19 19:12:44 Personal stocks are on the rise 
694 2018-05-19 19:11:50 Ban em bump stocks
695 2018-05-19 19:11:48 News that China agreed to reduce US trade Deficit on Saturday will  bring about a a major Nasdaq/SPY rally on Monday. Look for US stocks to rally on Monday!!
696 2018-05-19 19:11:46 Why does anyone need bump stocks? How many people have to die before reasonable gun laws are passed? #BanBumpStocks
697 2018-05-19 19:11:45 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
698 2018-05-19 19:11:19 Ban bump stocks
699 2018-05-19 19:10:50 Bump stocks need to be banned
700 2018-05-19 19:10:36 I was thinking about this.. & maybe stocks just wants jay to establish herself w/ the 2nd unit from the get-go so there are fewer adjustments that need to be made when sloot returns? Basically, insert sloot into hopkins spot & everything else stays the same.. idk
701 2018-05-19 19:10:15 Among the students proposals:  ban assault rifles & bump stocks & high cap mags.  What have you got to offer?
702 2018-05-19 19:09:44 Ban bump stocks and look at the entire picture. A lot needs to be done.
703 2018-05-19 19:09:40 BAN THESE FREAKING BUMP STOCKS!!!!!
704 2018-05-19 19:07:56 It could backfire on them. The city don't believe brexit will happen and stocks are picking up . If Brexit doesn't happen they would have lost out on a fortune.

728 2018-05-19 19:01:45 And yet all first world countries look at Americas healthcare system as what not to do in their countries!

732 2018-05-19 19:00:34 Is HMNY a crypto coin or stocks?
733 2018-05-19 19:00:08 Please ban bump stocks
734 2018-05-19 18:59:59 Lets crush this tweet too. MORE people in New England and New York owned Internet stocks than ALL OF CALIIFORNIA. Same with India. The richest city owns the stock or gold too. Now good luck.
735 2018-05-19 18:58:54 Ban bump stocks and gun shows!
736 2018-05-19 18:58:50 In the absence of immediate action by Congress, I urge ATF to finalize its proposed rule clarifying that bump fire stocks, along with other “conversion devices” that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as “machineguns” under the National Firearms Act.
737 2018-05-19 18:58:27 pls get suju world tour items to start selling online because i didnt had the chance to get em during concert lol i fuking hate the queues and that limited stocks available fuk
738 2018-05-19 18:58:02 BAN BUMP STOCKS
739 2018-05-19 18:57:35 There is no logical reason NOT to ban bump stocks and the like - to not pursue this as a leader in government is indefensible.
740 2018-05-19 18:57:11 It's path dependent.  Shorting internet stocks from 1998 to 2001 would have made money, but you would have probably gone bust in between.
741 2018-05-19 18:56:53 Bump stocks are just a  part of a bigger problem. And it must be done to remove the use of them in addition to other measures that will protect our citizens. Politicians must stop selling our kids souls to the NRA
742 2018-05-19 18:56:51 Done. My comment reads I want bump stocks banned. I also want universal background checks and I want required classes with testing in safety and proficiency along with required licensing for all gun owners.
743 2018-05-19 18:56:36 Common sense gun laws are not hard . Ban bump stocks #NeverAgainIsAlwaysAgain
744 2018-05-19 18:56:11 This is a New World Wealth report. It takes into account the private wealth owned by individuals in the city which includes Property, stocks, Cash, Gold etc. This is not based on City's GDP. I know per capita income of Delhi is higher. The glamour which Mumbai has Delhi lacks 
745 2018-05-19 18:55:15 So how does one "bump stocks"?
746 2018-05-19 18:54:34 I’d invest too but like shit like 10 K ina. Few stocks but the super super safe ones like amazon
747 2018-05-19 18:54:03 Ban bump stocks!
748 2018-05-19 18:54:00 Ban bump stocks!
749 2018-05-19 18:53:48 Yes. Ban bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles

752 2018-05-19 18:53:00 Bump stocks are a waste of money...they waste ammunition and make for inaccurate shooting.
753 2018-05-19 18:52:58 Why bump stocks? How does this change anything
754 2018-05-19 18:52:38 You are living in a reverse economic realty. My stocks went so crazy I bought a second home and received company bonuses equal to most ppls yearly salary. .based on economic perf of the company.
755 2018-05-19 18:52:33 Ban bump stocks now!
756 2018-05-19 18:52:26 I support a ban on bump stocks! Kids lives are on the line!
757 2018-05-19 18:51:34 Bump stocks should be banned.

763 2018-05-19 18:50:15 Do away with bump stocks now for the sake of our kids.
764 2018-05-19 18:50:05 Ban bump stocks! Sensible Gun Laws NOW!
765 2018-05-19 18:49:49 Since Las Vegas there was a bi-partisan consensus that banning bump stocks was the least we could do. I guess sending prayers remains the hands down favorite in the least we can do category.
766 2018-05-19 18:49:46 Bumping stocks verbieden een schijnmaatregel? Je hoeft geen fan van Trump te zijn hoor, maar je zit vol met haat. Kan niet goed zijn voor je.
767 2018-05-19 18:49:43 @Amber_Stocks got the Sky moving the ball like the Spurs....
768 2018-05-19 18:49:43 There is no rational need for bump stocks except to kill as many people possible in the shortest amount of time.
769 2018-05-19 18:49:34 I am a gun owner, NRA member, Vet and  retire LEO. I have yet to hear a convincing argument for the value of bump stocks for the AR/M4 platform. As they assist in the rapid fire of a semi-auto rifle, they cant help with accuracy.
770 2018-05-19 18:49:15 Please ban bump stocks
771 2018-05-19 18:49:13 Political headwinds & oil rise can hurt many stocks..so stay with good quality businesses with good cash flows/debt levels/product based cos/good managements
772 2018-05-19 18:48:44 Ban bump stocks, NRA and the second amendment.
773 2018-05-19 18:48:44 Y otro triple de @alliequigley tras un buen movimiento de balón de las Sky. 62-75 para las de Amber Stocks.
774 2018-05-19 18:48:40 Ban bump stocks!!
775 2018-05-19 18:48:11 Trump krijgt de schuld van alle shootings sinds 1798. 

- Trump heeft openlijk gezegd dat hij de steun van NRA niet nodig heeft
- heeft bumpimg stocks verboden
- wapenverkoop gedaald
- Remimgton bijna failliet
- minimumleeftijd verhoogd naar 21

Maar ja, leraren met wapens hè
776 2018-05-19 18:47:59 Ban bump stocks
777 2018-05-19 18:47:57 Ban bump stocks
778 2018-05-19 18:47:31 No brainer.  Ban bump stocks
779 2018-05-19 18:46:36 They will lose.  Agree there were signs missed, but there is no right to any kind of weapon you want.  Even Scalia said as much in the Heller decision.  And bump stocks like those that slaughtered all those country music fans in Vegas.

C’mon man...
780 2018-05-19 18:46:12 There is no legitimate purpose for bump stocks. There is no logical argument against their ban. Anyone who says otherwise cares more about their access to making their weapon automatic, than they care about human life and safety. #BanBumpStocks
781 2018-05-19 18:46:04 Ban bump stocks!!! Enough!
782 2018-05-19 18:44:45 Ban bump stocks, ban nra, ban anything trump, ban trump supporters
783 2018-05-19 18:44:39 Ban bump stocks now!!!!
784 2018-05-19 18:44:36 Als dat het enige argument is in deze discussie dan weet ik genoeg. Hij heeft gezegd dat hij die wet niet zomaar kan invoeren. Gaat hij ook niet doen. Wat hij wel deed was de bump stocks verbieden.
785 2018-05-19 18:44:34 BAN THE DAMN BUMP STOCKS! VOTE THEM OUT!!!
786 2018-05-19 18:44:19 Ban bump stocks! It’s common sense
787 2018-05-19 18:44:10 1. Here’s an idea. Try it the other way. Make it harder to get a gun. Set up a national data base. Waiting periods, age limits, semi automatic bans, no bump stocks or high volume magazines. Make the manufacturers start issuing smart triggers.
788 2018-05-19 18:44:00 Time for @GOP to ban bump stocks
789 2018-05-19 18:43:53 Ban bump stocks, assault weapons and large capacity magazines.
790 2018-05-19 18:43:50 Same applies to stocks and indexes
791 2018-05-19 18:43:34 You need to go to discord. Liehub is nothing but a joke and a place for paid bashers to try to turn people away from good stocks while their bosses load up. They are notorious for putting up false info. Which has been busted many times. The place is a shit show nothing more.
792 2018-05-19 18:43:11 Ban bump stocks! Ban all automatic weapons for non- military use! Universal background checks! Gun licenses! #CommonSenseGunLaws
793 2018-05-19 18:42:23 Ban bump stocks!  And let's ban politicians who place their own power above the safety of Americans.
794 2018-05-19 18:42:09 Am I wrong??? Lmfao invest in stocks and bonds first, then invest in a partner lol or get a partner who's finna finance ya through your dreams
795 2018-05-19 18:41:40 Imma try to really help you. The 30k commenters are not an actual representation of the numbers of Americans against bumpstocks. It's more like a thermometer, a measurement of the amount of ire the public has for bump stocks. Not all 330m will see this. Do you understand?
796 2018-05-19 18:41:37 Make this a litmus test for your vote. Don't allow NRA, high cap. Mags, bump stocks or background checks in the conversation. Tell them either support funding for armed personnel, metal detectors and single entry point, or their opponent gets your vote. TELL THEM TO DO SOMETHING.
797 2018-05-19 18:41:31 It just makes sense to ban bump stocks...please ban them so more people will not die.
798 2018-05-19 18:41:15 Ban bump stocks ASAP.
799 2018-05-19 18:41:03 Ban bump stocks

#BanBumpStocks
801 2018-05-19 18:40:49 We don’t need bump stocks. Automatic weapons, or anything that allows a weapon to perform like an automatic weapon should be banned. We need elected officials that will work to ban them.
802 2018-05-19 18:40:41 Ban bump stocks
803 2018-05-19 18:40:33 For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Written on the stocks where you got splatted with tomatoes. Or worse.

815 2018-05-19 18:38:38 Hey goofball, they are already writing the law at the DOJ that bans bump stocks, where have you been??  And also, the ATF will be regulating them and many states are already doing so, you need to find a new hobby, your activism is obtuse.
816 2018-05-19 18:38:20 Man... I'm looking to get my hands on a PS4 Pro and sell my PS. Stocks are completely depleted here. :(

819 2018-05-19 18:37:50 well of course we should ban bump stocks!
820 2018-05-19 18:37:14 A 15 year old can legally own a firearm, even though they can't purchase it themselves. Plus the availability of high capacity magazines and bump stocks that make mass killings so easy. Reps and the NRA act like banning both of those is a human rights violation
821 2018-05-19 18:37:00 Ban bump stocks!
822 2018-05-19 18:36:34 Bump stocks??? You think that makes a difference? Any qualified rifleman can take down multiple targets with a good aim. Wonder why this keeps happening, it’s not a gun issue. It’s what is behind the trigger and the heart of that person
823 2018-05-19 18:36:10 Ban Bump Stocks
824 2018-05-19 18:35:52 Ban bump stocks
825 2018-05-19 18:35:40 Could you explain further why that is , and also would you say the same applies to stocks and indexes?
826 2018-05-19 18:35:25 what?! 10k for shopping?! Better get some stocks, pay off some debt then pay up ya life insurance
827 2018-05-19 18:35:21 Ban bump stocks. Restrict access to military grade weaponry. Fund counseling at schools. Drop the NRA as a campaign funding source.
828 2018-05-19 18:35:10 Definitely ban bump stocks now!  #BanAssaultWeapons #banbumpstocks
829 2018-05-19 18:35:05 How can any intelligent human being defend bump stocks? They are unnecessary and dangerous.

836 2018-05-19 18:33:33 2 Power Stocks and 50% of your lifebar.
837 2018-05-19 18:33:22 For 100 years, bump stocks were fine... then a mentally ill highscooler goes bonkers and we suddenly need to ban everyone from them? You liberals are wacky! Thank God for the 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
838 2018-05-19 18:33:20 First, sadly bump stocks are not banned, currently there’s a Justice dept proposal to do so, but it’s not been enacted. Also, You’re being willfully obtuse with the weapon nomenclature, trying to distract from the issue with semantics.
839 2018-05-19 18:32:53 Yes, they keep calling me asking to buy certain stocks, and if I say the market is going to fall they say why not sell some!! They made me sell some good stocks 3 yrs ago! :(
840 2018-05-19 18:32:10 Ban bump stocks NOW! #NeverAgain
841 2018-05-19 18:31:42 99.9999% of Americans do not use bump stocks, yet many people have been murdered by nuts using them. Ban bump stocks now!
842 2018-05-19 18:31:35 Ban bump stocks

848 2018-05-19 18:30:47 Think we need a broader ban, other than bump stocks, but let's start with this..

852 2018-05-19 18:29:56 We need to ban bump stocks...and more
853 2018-05-19 18:29:48 Ban bump stocks now!
854 2018-05-19 18:29:38 We do not. I even looked at the grocery store that stocks items from Japan but I think it must be too difficult to transport such a long way.
855 2018-05-19 18:29:29 I know it doesn't have a full auto setting no one said anything about full auto.  bump stocks should be banned.. full auto was outlawed in 1933
856 2018-05-19 18:29:18 There is no reason to allow bump stocks. 

Bump stocks are gunstocks that are specially designed to make bump firing easier, which allows semi-automatic firearms to mimic the firing speed of fully automatic firearms. 

Automatic weapons are illegal, so should bump stocks.
857 2018-05-19 18:29:17 Bump stocks will only make our situation worse.
858 2018-05-19 18:29:07 Sir, can we revisit little lower than 9950 by end of this expiry
859 2018-05-19 18:28:55 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW
860 2018-05-19 18:28:49 Yeah, ban bump stocks. It’s literally the least you can do.
861 2018-05-19 18:28:42 Comment. Also- ban bump stocks.
862 2018-05-19 18:28:39 Ban bump stocks
863 2018-05-19 18:28:17 No more bump stocks
864 2018-05-19 18:28:03 Why haven’t bump stocks already been banned? Even 45 said he was going to #banbumpstocks
865 2018-05-19 18:27:22 Ban bump stocks
866 2018-05-19 18:27:18 The only people who think that bump stocks are necessary to bump-fire a gun are people with no knowledge of guns.
867 2018-05-19 18:27:08 No they won't actually. Only 18% of California gun owners said they'd turn in their bump stocks. Even the Australian prime minister said their gun control is unrealistic in the US. to do what they did in the US they'd have to confiscate 60 million guns. Good luck with that.
868 2018-05-19 18:27:06 thanks for doing this. I definitely support banning bump Stocks #BanBumpStocks

871 2018-05-19 18:26:26 Ban Bump Stocks: Take the country back from the NRA.
872 2018-05-19 18:26:15 This person should be tarred & feathered & put in the "stocks". GOP wants to go backwards in time. Let's go back to the "good old times". @NancySinatra
873 2018-05-19 18:25:57 Ban bump stocks! Can we please try SOMETHING?!
874 2018-05-19 18:25:56 That is so damn ridiculous?! @facebook. Get your shit together, or those stocks will be worthless come 2019!
875 2018-05-19 18:25:43 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
876 2018-05-19 18:25:27 Bump stocks and military style weapon bans do NOT impede on 2nd ammendment rights. Ban is needed now! Gun laws are needed now! GOP needs to stop taking NRA blood money now. #guncontrol #gunreform #GunControlNow #GunViolence

884 2018-05-19 18:23:07 Only a handful of signatures because bump-stocks are clown shoes. They are not needed to bump-fire a gun.
885 2018-05-19 18:22:39 Ban bump stocks now!
886 2018-05-19 18:21:58 Ban Bump Stocks NOW!
887 2018-05-19 18:21:45 And yet these stubborn sheeple will just praise the numbers as “signs of McMahon’s genius programming”...
“See!? People are watching! Stocks are high! A shit show wouldn’t have great numbers, therefore WWE is wonderful!” and probably finish their rant with “Just enjoy it!”... 
888 2018-05-19 18:21:39 Yes! We must ban bump stocks! Yes. Vote!
889 2018-05-19 18:21:36 Profoundly upset about yesterday’s school shooting. It just keeps happening.

Please get out to the polls, vote against bump stocks and for reasonable gun control and candidates who support it.

Kids shouldn’t have to deal with this at all. And not, at all, this often.

894 2018-05-19 18:20:17 Look at whats making kids kill, not bump stocks.
895 2018-05-19 18:19:52 Your naivety is astounding. Only the ATF can ban bump stocks without congress. As much as I agree they should be banned, stop misleading people into thinking it can be done with twitter comments. This is why nobody takes you seriously
896 2018-05-19 18:19:46 Ban Bump Stocks!
897 2018-05-19 18:19:21 In response to the tragic school shooting in Texas, we’ve decided to go with the NRA-approved ban of bump stocks, again, and send extra thoughts and prayers.
898 2018-05-19 18:19:13 Ban bump stocks now! Life is to valuable to lose more beautiful souls.

908 2018-05-19 18:17:45 @davidhogg111 David: I commend all that you are doing, but it bothers me that you are settling on banning bump stocks, when all assault rifles must be banned. Don't let government/Congress bully you. Go all the way with this!
909 2018-05-19 18:17:27 You also did amazing holding your stocks! That 50/50 at the top was sick, y’all are nuts
910 2018-05-19 18:17:20 America would be better without bump stock. Ban bump stocks.

911 2018-05-19 18:17:13 The gun situation in the States is utterly shocking. 

Of course bump stocks should be banned. Duh.
912 2018-05-19 18:17:01 Thanks - couple of thoughts:
1/ this is assuming that buybacks automatically raise equity prices, but there is no evidence this is consistently the case; stocks with large repurchase programs do not outperform the broad market (see $PKW’s relative performance vs. market)

913 2018-05-19 18:16:58 Bump stocks can kill many almost at once -ban them !
914 2018-05-19 18:16:34 Commenting to ban bump stocks
915 2018-05-19 18:16:29 Diane Feinstein had it right, eliminate public sales of AR-15s. Eliminate the manufacture and sales of bump stocks. Disallow campaign contributions by gun and accessory manufacturers and the NRA!!
916 2018-05-19 18:16:20 Get rid of bump stocks.
917 2018-05-19 18:16:11 Bump stocks need to go!
918 2018-05-19 18:15:37 Dude,  keeeeep it real.   you need to ban human beings before banning bump stocks.
919 2018-05-19 18:15:28 BAN BUMP STOCKS. They kill people. #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain #GunViolenceIsAHealthIssue

928 2018-05-19 18:13:50 Ban Bump stocks!
929 2018-05-19 18:13:46 @sonyxperia I have been trying to get the flip cover for XA2 Ultra (SCSH20) Malaysia. Noone fr Sony MY is able to tell me when there will be stocks.
930 2018-05-19 18:13:44 You all use the term assault weapon, any weapon of choice is an assault weapon if used against another. Bump stocks are banned.. more mass shootings were done with a pistol than a rifle.
931 2018-05-19 18:13:29 1- choosing strategies requires broad analysis of the market and domestic/global economy.
2-your ignorance of my industry is showing.Managing wealth is more than picking stocks etc. Cap Ex, tax planning, estate planning, business expansion which requires obtaining capital..
932 2018-05-19 18:13:22 lol, SCOTUS already ruled against banning accessories, including bump stocks. Maybe you should enlist in the military. It would help you grow up. Maybe even teach you how to be a man.
933 2018-05-19 18:13:21 Please ban bump stocks
934 2018-05-19 18:13:20 BAN BUMP STOCKS!
935 2018-05-19 18:13:17 Earlier there was an assault rifle ban in place.  Expired in late 90s I think...  marketing plus the ability to customize the platform  (grips, sights, bump stocks etc.) Plus more deregulation and the cultural cache of manufacturers/nra... It's been heading this way for a while
936 2018-05-19 18:12:57 I don’t think banning bump stocks is the solution, but it’s a start. As one who comes from a family of hunters, I simply do not understand the need for weapons of mass destruction. They are not sporting guns, nor one for an average hunter. There needs to be tighter controls.
937 2018-05-19 18:12:50 I started a petition to ban bump stocks over a year ago, and it only got a handful of signatures.  I wish you the best on getting 30K comments.  People need to start to stand by their words and supporting the efforts that we all SAY they support.  Thank you @davidhogg111

944 2018-05-19 18:11:03 Banning bump stocks is a good place to start. Just Do It!
945 2018-05-19 18:11:01 You still won’t answer me and I’ve asked you repeatedly... why do you wanna ban bump stocks? Gimme one good reason and how it will change anything? I think  we’re all for reform but we need reform that makes sense. Maybe when you grow up you’ll understand that.  #fakesurvivor
946 2018-05-19 18:10:50 Ban bump stocks
947 2018-05-19 18:10:33 More like dump stocks, amirite? 

For reals 2Aers we don’t want your guns. We want to make sure that everyone who gets them is as safe and responsible as you.
948 2018-05-19 18:10:22 I asked about a bill that can fix what the existing ones have FAILED to do. All of these ARE the failed ideas of the past.  Increasing background checks to stop people who steal guns?  Bump stocks when they are almost never used? Money for labs rather than for practitioners?
949 2018-05-19 18:09:52 We need to do more than just ban bump stocks. Our children are being slaughtered. The NRA backed by gun mgfs need to go. These kids bleed for their greed.
950 2018-05-19 18:09:46 No more bump stocks!! COME ON!!  Keep your guns, but let’s be smart and think about Saving some lives!! This fight is not about guns...it’s about doing what is right.

953 2018-05-19 18:09:03 I'm in favor of banning bump stocks. I'm in favor of a comprehensive overhaul of this country's ineffective gun laws. I'm in favor of students feeling safe in school.
954 2018-05-19 18:09:02 I'm definitely no gun expert, but bump stocks seem like such a small part of this epidemic. Why not regulate, like other licenses. Require  updates, proficiency tests, mental evals. I know you 2A'ers will go nuts, so let's hear it.
955 2018-05-19 18:08:57 Ban bump stocks. Keep working hard, David. We stand with you.
956 2018-05-19 18:08:53 So what few people seem to understand is, when Trump attempts to "stick it" to Bezos, what's he's actually doing is hurting a vast amount of underpaid Amazon workers, who take low wages because they are supplemented with Amazon stocks. Not to mention HUGE #AbuseOfPower
957 2018-05-19 18:08:53 More must be done but  this is a great start get rid of Bump stocks 
958 2018-05-19 18:08:40 Ban Bump Stocks
959 2018-05-19 18:08:37 okay there you go, there’s something. banning the bump stocks that allow for that rate of fire. unfortunately the nra roadblocks even that amount of legislation. hence why people are angry
960 2018-05-19 18:08:27 Ban bump stocks---save lives!  Pretty simple.
961 2018-05-19 18:08:18 The drunk driving laws don't physically stop drunks from driving, but the deterrent force of the law - plus penalties - do reduce deaths and injuries by reducing drunk driving.  

The same with banning bump stocks.
962 2018-05-19 18:07:55 Please list school shootings where bump stocks were used.
963 2018-05-19 18:07:33 Ban bump stocks now. We said #neveragain  yet we had Waffle House and now Santa Fe.

972 2018-05-19 18:05:45 Over a decade in the Army and 4 combat tours and I can think of no conceivable reason for bump stocks to be a necessity in civilian hands. Hell even in the military we only used 3 round burst for suppressive fire. #VetsVstheNRA
973 2018-05-19 18:05:35 Ban bump stocks NOW
974 2018-05-19 18:05:22 This is a no brainer.  I want people to live. Ban bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks
975 2018-05-19 18:05:21 I wondered why my @Twitter stocks went down some time ago...turns out that the company was exposed at being nothing but ran by a white fraternity...
976 2018-05-19 18:05:20 Time for a change! Get rid of bump stocks! Sensible gun laws! Protect our children
977 2018-05-19 18:05:18 DONE  
Here is my comment:

“Bump stocks turn a semi-automatic weapon into a machine gun. They enabled the Las Vegas shooter to commit the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Today, bump stocks are completely unregulated – anyone can buy one.”

 CHANGE THIS NOW!! 
978 2018-05-19 18:05:10 @SunilBSinghania ready for 30-50 pc of losses more in midcaps in next 3 months. All your fav stocks are getting sold by rmf
979 2018-05-19 18:04:59 First, there aren’t fully automatic Ar15s. There are BUMP stocks that allow is to achieve that rate of fire, but it isn’t factory built in on civilian models. If anything ban those accessories. Second, white gun owners walk down the streets with an open carry, so why not?
980 2018-05-19 18:04:25 I support a ban on bump stocks!
981 2018-05-19 18:04:14 Banning bump stocks does what ? How many lives are saved....if any ?
982 2018-05-19 18:04:13 Clinton: Banned assault rifles
Bush: Let ban lapse. 
Obama: Brief dem control then NRA/GOP control and refusal to even hear gun control bill after Sandy Hook. 
Trump: "You are afraid of the NRA, ha ha! Bump stocks. Arm well-trained teachers" and then zero action.  It's the guns.
983 2018-05-19 18:04:03 I think that's it. The ice stocks in the close up pics look just like the ones these guys where using.
984 2018-05-19 18:03:52 It is NOT the guns.  It is NOT the bump Stocks.  It is NOT the TOOLS!  Gun Free Zones are like shooting fish in a barrel. Protect the children and have armed officers and teachers.  It works in Israel and it will work here.  Get your damn heads out of the sand.

986 2018-05-19 18:02:09 Ban bump stocks !!!
987 2018-05-19 18:02:04 Ban stocks save children
988 2018-05-19 18:02:03 Ban bump stocks
989 2018-05-19 18:01:51 Actually, Congress is needed, because the statutory definition of a machine gun simply doesn't apply to bump stocks.  President Trump is mistaken squinting at it in the hopes it will hold up, but it won't.
990 2018-05-19 18:01:51 ban bump stocks, control who gets to own guns, no automatics, background checks, licences required.  all of that and more
991 2018-05-19 18:01:44 Ban Bump Stocks
992 2018-05-19 18:01:42 Ban bump stocks
993 2018-05-19 18:01:36 Ban bump stocks!  Increase gun regulations and funding for mental health treatment
994 2018-05-19 18:01:33 I’d love to win the lottery and then invest in stocks and just have a nice relaxing life but shit just isn’t that easy
995 2018-05-19 18:01:08 Ban bump stocks
996 2018-05-19 18:01:04 Ban bump stocks and implement gun measures that include federal background checks, licensing, liability insurance and no semi-automatic weaponry.
997 2018-05-19 18:01:01 Why is this even a thing? Of course we should ban bump stocks!
998 2018-05-19 18:00:55 After every correction there will be new leaders of new bounce back and bull market. Don't try to pick stocks based on how much they have corrected from top.
It's like selling your winners and holding on to losers and in the long run one only has underperforming stocks in PF.
999 2018-05-19 18:00:36 Ban bump stocks!
1000 2018-05-19 18:00:34 Ban bump stocks now!
1001 2018-05-19 17:59:48 Ban bump stocks!
1002 2018-05-19 17:59:13 There’s no reason to ban bump stocks
1003 2018-05-19 17:58:26 We must ban bump stocks.
1004 2018-05-19 17:58:17 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW

1006 2018-05-19 17:54:23 Eliminate the use of bump fire stocks, make gun violence a health concern (for research, can include mental health), better national back ground checks, and introduce better safety features for gun owners. To start. #EnoughIsEnough DEMAND a better future.

1009 2018-05-19 17:53:11 Visited the Gothenburg 'English food shop' today. It stocks a whole host of typical stuff you would find in Sainos or Tesco. Having been living in Sweden for 9 months now I realised that there is almost nothing I miss.
1010 2018-05-19 17:52:26 The case for many commodities, stocks, bonds, whatever
1011 2018-05-19 17:52:06 Bump stocks were not illegal and if I’m correct still aren’t illegal. If you are discharged you can still legally own a firearm? Regardless of how he obtained them he still obtained them legally so I do not see your point.

Banning AR-15s - NO

Universal background checks - NO
Background checks for ammo - NO
Raising minimum age for gun purchases to 21 - NO
1016 2018-05-19 17:43:59 In a less tolerant, but more principled time, he would have been put in stocks  and eventually swung from the yardarm.
1017 2018-05-19 17:43:09 What happened to hiring Veterans as security guards? What happened to all of the ideas from "the people" that offered strong suggestions to stop this crisis. Stopping the sale of bump stocks was a positive move, but it doesn't end there. Do something now! Go all the way!!!
1018 2018-05-19 17:42:28 Stockscrazy, all these info are available in public domain. Let me put ur question in another context!  How someone know that he is the son of the man he call as father? Was he there during impregnation? No! The info is there in the birth certificate!

1025 2018-05-19 17:37:29 I really didn't think it was legal or ethical for a president to use the influence of his office to wreck havoc on a business like he is doing. I read that their stocks went down after one of his tweets. This hurts more than just Bezo there are stock holders and employees as well
1026 2018-05-19 17:34:41 Yes, ban ARs - ubiquitous or not.  Trigger activators: yes, made up name - I meant bump stocks, trigger cranks. Retailer checks are fine but how about shows and private sales?  Need regulations.  Existing criminal bans fine - but needs Fix NICS.

1029 2018-05-19 17:31:34 @HillaryClinton First enforce the laws we have, get criminals off the streets and keep them off, some laws do need to be changed such as outlaw bump stocks, no guns or knives for those with mental illness or domestic violence histories, more cooperation between agencies.
1030 2018-05-19 17:31:15 You must be new here. Whats driving this name (and all stocks) are fundamentals: EPS, Sales, etc, etc.  I do 10x more work on that than charts. A Box is just a framing tool that has no predictive value.  Best of luck to you

Sadly unable to predict anything with my stocks 
Need to invest more time.
1036 2018-05-19 17:24:15 This govt, I believe, will throw everything at the market to save it before elections.

1045 2018-05-19 17:19:27 How about stronger backround checks that are mandatory for ANY firearms purchase? Physiological Testing? Ban bump stocks and other unnecessary modifications for firearms? Regulation for gun storage so children stop accidentally shooting themselves. That would be a good start.
1046 2018-05-19 17:19:05 "We're gonna do strong background checks, we're gonna work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18, we're getting rid of the bump-stocks, and we're going to be focusing very strongly on mental health" And Liberals say Trump will do nothing.

1053 2018-05-19 17:16:41 Well I am personaly not a fan of bump stocks. Mainly a pride thing. If you need a bump stock to shoot a semi auto almost as fast a a full auto then you suck at shooting.
1054 2018-05-19 17:16:35 maybe.. oooor.. stocks just be doin weird stuff

1065 2018-05-19 17:11:09 Scream “Look! Rep don’t want to ban bump stocks! They want holders to die!” It’s an idiotic play that does nothing but make the issue become even more polarized and farther from actually becoming the law. Tvplays to their hardline base and that’s what they want.

1070 2018-05-19 17:09:47 Anti-C&R crowd cite Dempson et al's (2012) finding: 10% of Atlantic Salmon die via C&R. 

So, I decided to read the abstract:

"Results of the study should encourage managers to continue to use catch and release as a viable tool in the management of Atlantic salmon stocks".
1071 2018-05-19 17:09:24 Also, bump stocks, you incandescent moron.

1073 2018-05-19 17:08:11 *eyeroll* maybe you should learn to read, because I did answer, but because you seemed to miss it, I'll repeat; I think the laws we have right now are fine (with exception, tactical stocks muzzles and magazine bans, which is why the "assault weapon" ban did nothing)
1074 2018-05-19 17:07:45 After almost whole day and a half without sleep. I was able to think about my future. Ifeconomy is how it is now, we could have another great UNEXPECTED boom *cough*stocks and I really hope I make the right move and be apart of that.. I just haven’t figured out what market 
1075 2018-05-19 17:07:12 Gov Abbott, the only talked need is ‘stop the sale of bump stocks and AK anything. This is not rocket science.  Other states have stepped up to the plate so should Texas!!!
1076 2018-05-19 17:06:36 If this were actually true, there would already have been enforced background checks, a ban on assault weapons & excessive clips and bump stocks. Inaction is complicity; on your watch @POTUS is when these murders occurred. We will not forget!
1077 2018-05-19 17:05:54 Then do something like stricter background checks, psychological testing & no work arounds for Internet or gun show purchases. Reinstate the assault weapons ban and ban bump stocks. Do nothing and just support NRA then u have our children’s blood on your hands!
1078 2018-05-19 17:05:53 Inflation increases at about 2% a year. A diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds should increase at an average rate of 6% a year. Always take a value investors approach on investing, for proof look at Warren Buffett.
1079 2018-05-19 17:04:29 @realDonaldTrump President Trump, how much money does the NRA pay you?
You continue to talk AND do nothing! You said bump stocks would be banned after the Vegas murders. All talk AND no action!
AMERICAN POLITICIAN BOUGHT AND SOLD BY THE NRA
1080 2018-05-19 17:01:54 Banned bump stocks?  That’s it?  How about background checks and increasing age?  He said he would do this...until the nra put him in his place.  Weakling.
1081 2018-05-19 17:01:43 In the amount of time it takes to go from being a “good guy with a gun” to a “bad guy with a gun” you can mow down about 20 kids thanks to the @NRA’s lobbying to keep high capacity magazines and bump stocks on the market. So, yes, we’re coming for your guns. All of them.

If you're rich, poor people on the right call you an elitist and make plans to pillory you in the stocks someday.
1085 2018-05-19 16:59:11 Nah im ok with some rilfes handguns and shot guns. Shit you'd use for hunting/self defense. No need for things like ARs and bump stocks
1086 2018-05-19 16:58:41 Banned bump stocks. Tried to work with FBI but they are more concerned with the Russian probe. Obama did nothing and nobody complained about him.

1098 2018-05-19 16:43:06 I thought all you "responsible" NRA gun loving nuts would at least lock up your guns. 

We respect the 2nd amendment but let's use some common sense when it comes to today's need for basic stricter gun laws.

1. Mandatory locks/checks on gun owners.

2. Ban bump stocks

je cours faire les stocks!!!!!!!!
1100 2018-05-19 16:42:18 Common sense gun laws... but don't ban the weapon. Full auto is already banned. Bump stocks, there you are correct. No need for that. Low capacity msgs won't change anything. But mods to help put more rounds downrange should be eliminated. Maybe not chroming barrels.
1101 2018-05-19 16:39:55 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1102 2018-05-19 16:39:47 None of the proposed gun control laws would stop shootings, You can ban the AR15, 30 round mags, make everyone do a background check and ban all the bump stocks. None of those laws stop anyone from using a pistol, shotgun, lever action that can cause the same damage.

1104 2018-05-19 16:38:09 The problem is, Amy, in the amount of time it takes to go from law-abiding gun owner to law-breaking gun owner, you can mow down about 20 kids thanks to the @NRA’s lobbying efforts to keep high-capacity magazines and bump stocks readily accessible to kids.
1105 2018-05-19 16:35:14 Guys would find out I was on the market- gossip is great-  they'd show up with all their paper-stocks, banking, biz plans, etc- go over the plans to see if I was interested in helping them level up. They'd tell me how much time- 6 months, a year, marriage w/ babies.
1106 2018-05-19 16:35:12 Oh no. We want improved health care, including mental health care for all AND we want stricter gun licensing, a national gun owner registry database, and ban on assault riffle, bump stocks.

1111 2018-05-19 16:30:50 Lol, let's get this straight. So if you buy stocks and they crash, you can go into minus and so create debt. If you buy crypto and make profit you can take out your initial investment without any problem or losing the asset.
1112 2018-05-19 16:30:24 Had the father properly locked up the weapons in the home in accordance with Texas law, this particular attack wouldn’t have happened. As to your question about the NRA - they spend millions fighting ALL gun control legislation. They’re even against banning bump stocks.
1113 2018-05-19 16:28:35 Or maybe Hollywood actors dislike guns in the hands of 17 and 18 year olds. Maybe they dislike automatic weapons, bump stocks or high capacity magazines in the hands of people who have been convicted of domestic violence, exhibited violent behavior... what do you think?
1114 2018-05-19 16:28:17 Trumps a liar that doesn't keep his promises
He promised to make bump stocks illegal but hasn't done it.
Plus an age limit.
The NRA talked him out of it.
They now make our gun laws & That's illegal.
1115 2018-05-19 16:27:41 AFAIK after a long period of time some chemicals start leaking into the water from the plastic but its such a negligible amount that in an emergency you wouldn't have the leisure of caring about it. Would keep stocks at room temp and rotated every couple years ideally
1116 2018-05-19 16:26:36 @PARABOLICSHORT @Cameron_Carlisle Yes you can target stocks under 10 only and float and volume to what ever you want it.
1117 2018-05-19 16:24:30 Hay una línea muy fina ahí. Subir las tasas (y más las de LP como piensa hacer el BCRA para reducir el stocks de LEBAC a corto) puede profundizar la sensación de no estar logrando el objetivo de desinflación y terminar teniendo el efecto contrario en expectativas

1119 2018-05-19 16:24:07 Removing assault weapons won't change things.  Limiting magazine capacity, making bump stocks illegal, and actually enforcing current laws would help much more, but someone could do more damage with a handgun, carry a higher capacity magazine, and more ammo in a backpack.
1120 2018-05-19 16:23:58 Housing prices can’t go up eternally- if the stock market suffers a prolonged correction, how will people afford down-payments (& stay employed?) 2 relatives of mine made down-payments mostly from Amazon RSUs. Most of my cash is in stocks too.
1121 2018-05-19 16:23:01 #1& 2 are/can be covered by all States using NICS. Unless a crime is committed No1needs 2 give Gov. access 2 anything. I haven't made an informed decision yet about bump stocks. #6 is already done, #7 is a way 2 have Police get the money they need, #8 is definitely a NO.
1122 2018-05-19 16:22:50 allez faire les stocks maintenant!!!!!
1123 2018-05-19 16:22:49 Asking to ban semi automatic rifles & bump stocks is completely different than saying “guns are bad”. Two completely different debates that unfortunately the lines get blurred on
1124 2018-05-19 16:21:20 And again...the gun nuts refuse to hear we don't want to take all their damn guns away. We just want bump stocks, military style weapons, & high capacity clips/magazines banned. National registry. Mandatory background & waiting periods. No domestic violence convictions. Stop NRA.

1127 2018-05-19 16:17:19 Obama era made bump stocks legal. Trump is moving to ban them.

1140 2018-05-19 16:07:38 Sorry but I totally disagree with you as putting a ban on bump stocks it's not going far enough

1142 2018-05-19 16:06:45 This just in, PassKey's stocks just dropped 362 points. The company is now worth the same as a half-bitten-off McRib.
1143 2018-05-19 16:05:57 For stock buying , buy those near support or at support vs taking BO specially for Russell 2000 index stocks.. Let it BO and if it is legit BO then it will come back to retest BO level. At that time you can buy if Russell is still trading higher. if it just go up then let it be.
1144 2018-05-19 16:05:54 We had bullying and access to guns in the 50's, 60's, 70's etc. Carried them in our cars to hunt after school, some actually built stocks for them in woodshop.  But I don't remember school shootings!
1145 2018-05-19 16:04:54 Stocks are funny in a way since they really are fueled by optimism. And vica versa.

1160 2018-05-19 15:57:24 I do agree, like every other damn person in the country- besides like 100 people- that there's no need for ARs, no reason for bump stocks, & that the legal purchasing age should be moved up to 21, at least. As far as stopping it over all, mental health care reform is essential.

1165 2018-05-19 15:55:49 .Cavuto is correct. But he has not solved the problem of “when seconds count, cops are only minutes away.” Santa Fe High had too few armed adults, and no single point of entry with a metal detector. THESE THINGS WILL WORK! Banning bump stocks or changing the age to 21 do nothing.
1166 2018-05-19 15:54:45 What are his favorite stocks?
1167 2018-05-19 15:54:15 This Santa Fe shooter used a handgun & a shotgun. Most of the mass shootings under Trump involved legally purchased AR-15s. The only one that involved bump stocks was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history in Las Vegas. Trump didn’t get a ban on bump stocks. He’s all talk! 
1168 2018-05-19 15:53:08 did they ever even pass a bill on bump stocks? The NRA is truly evil-the epitome of greed over government.
1169 2018-05-19 15:52:19 Would any liberal #GunControl politics have stopped Santa Fe shooter?

Banning AR-15s - NO
Banning high capacity magazines - NO
Banning bump stocks - NO
Universal background checks - NO
Background checks for ammo - NO
Raising minimum age for gun purchases to 21 - NO
1170 2018-05-19 15:51:58 Why did America allow the NRA to become the 4th party?

They help make our gun laws.
Trump's a liar &didnt keep his promise of changing the legal age to buy firearms &bann bump stocks.

After he had dinner with the NRA he changed his mind...

1179 2018-05-19 15:47:16 In the wake of the #Parkland shootings, the NRA sued the state of FL after it enacted legislation banning bump stocks and raised the age  limit on AR15-style rifles to 21.

I don’t see that as protecting the Constitution.
1180 2018-05-19 15:46:47 Here's more than aren't gun bans! Requiring a permit, with extensive background check, and safety training for all semi-auto rifles. No more high capacity mags. No bump stocks. No hair triggers. No armor piercing ammo. 

I could do this all day!

1182 2018-05-19 15:44:17 It's my understanding public elected officials or corrupt and serve themselves that's why they're allowed to do insider trading. It's illegal to hand a senator a shoebox full of cash but it's okay to hand them a shoebox  of stocks worth millions.
1183 2018-05-19 15:42:11 That he’s corrupt? 500mil from China and he flips on zte. Trading stocks as president. Hired Pruitt to break epa and enrich Carl Icahn. DeVos to enrich charter school investors, not showing his taxes, not divesting from his company. Trump is profiting off the office.
1184 2018-05-19 15:41:16 Trump proposed a ban on bump stocks. It has to go through Congress. Looks like he did that on March 10. Sounds like he at least did more than cry.

1188 2018-05-19 15:38:40 Many good quality stocks are at attractive valuations. Nifty may drop to 10000 but only to bounce back to 12000 within 2 years. Choose quality over risk this time period.
1189 2018-05-19 15:37:19 1 raise the age to purchase a firearm to 21.
2 hold people legally liable who allow juveniles access to their guns, unsupervised. 
3 reinstall the assault weapon ban, and ban bump stocks while we're at it

I think this would be a start.

1220 2018-05-19 15:16:14 Kevin, same here ! Just a few years younger ! Lol
MOST of us gun owners want background check loopholes closed, banning hi cap magazines, banning bump stocks, and higher age limits for purchasing. 
The NRA has killed the ability to even have a discussion of gun laws in Congress.
1221 2018-05-19 15:16:11 Ben Shapiro smoked DMT and Milton Friedman told him you can never go wrong with defense stocks.
1222 2018-05-19 15:15:54 There is no shortage of vehicles or bank accounts and therefore no crisis with having multiples. Stocks are not a necessity of life. Housing, food, water all are. If people are hoarding those necessities or foreign money is pushing them out of reach actions must be taken.
1223 2018-05-19 15:14:24 3-4 is a very conservative number. I am sure more can outperform from cherry picking when there are 100 stocks to choose from.
1224 2018-05-19 15:14:17 それすぎてソレノイドになった
1225 2018-05-19 15:14:04 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks.  Expand background checks. Take guns from domestic abusers.  #CommonSenseGunLaws are needed NOW.
1226 2018-05-19 15:13:50 For years, I studied charts obsessively into the wee hours of night. My most productive habit was looking at 100s of stocks that had big moves backed up to the day BEFORE the move began and ask “why should this be on my watchlist and what gets me in” to find the common threads.
1227 2018-05-19 15:13:46 Yes Canada has strict gun laws, bans assault rifles, no bump stocks allowed, background checks and training for a FAC firearms acquisition certificate needed to buy a gun, guns are registered. Mandatory metal locked cabinet and trigger locks for each gun.
1228 2018-05-19 15:13:18 jk kung pano talaga malaman ang halaga... ng stocks HAHAHAHA
1229 2018-05-19 15:13:16 but there is not enough being done. SOMETHING needs to be done. Whether it’s more gun restrictions, banning bum stocks, more background checks. These things can make a huge difference. Congress needs to do their job. People are getting their lives taken away too fast.
1230 2018-05-19 15:13:02 Here's an idea!  Put schools in high security prison complexes!  Problem solved!

Or, how about we enact federal gun legislation, not local, to remove semi-autos, bump stocks, high capacity magazines.  And extensive training, registration, waiting periods, as other countries did.

1239 2018-05-19 15:03:29 I think it’s definitely possible. I think of Apple as the MJ or Lebron of stocks, it’s very polarizing for some reason, not all people appreciate greatness when it’s right in front of their faces. But if you’re one of the lucky ones that do, just sit back and enjoy the show

1246 2018-05-19 14:56:27 Also a function of what type of stocks are IPO’ing. I assume most of this today are Biotech companies (which need to raise money to go through trials, often don’t want VC money, and have no revenue at this stage).

1253 2018-05-19 14:48:23 Chris- except this time it wasn’t assault weapons. So there has to be more to it than looking at bump stocks and AR-10s. Accountability for the legal gun owners, perhaps, when they lose track of their weapons?
1254 2018-05-19 14:48:22 If you're a trend trader don't trade a stock unless it is trending. Many get chopped up trying to find a trend that isn't there $SPY 

If ur a mean reversion trader don't trade trending stocks

Pretty simple concepts but the hard part is figuring out what is trending & what isn't

1260 2018-05-19 14:44:48 L'usage de l'expression "ressources humaines" m'a toujours fait le même effet. On est pas des hommes ou femmes mais une ressource... humain n'est qu'un qualificatif une propriété, pas une nature pas une essence.
Donc gérer des ressources via des stocks quoi de plus naturel ?
1261 2018-05-19 14:43:20 For me politicians need to state their position on guns (universal background checks, high volume magazines, bump stocks and semiautomatic rifles) and women’s right to choose. Answer both with examples of past actions or stop campaigning. These are basic building blocks

1270 2018-05-19 14:39:41 I would imagine that if you strip home equity out of wealth, the Gini for wealth would explode even more, perhaps .7?! Home equity is not the same as stocks and corporate bonds which entail the appropriation of income produced by others.

1293 2018-05-19 14:28:22 Ban bump stocks, keep military-grade assault riffles off streets, universal background checks, no weapons for violent offenders or mentally ill, and obviously we would need a maintained and centralized database. It's work, but achievable.
1294 2018-05-19 14:26:52 What an ignorant statement to make. The worst president ever did nothing to prevent school shootings. At least President Trump banned bump stocks.

1301 2018-05-19 14:19:55 Bump stocks are still legal. The NRA will challenge any ruling by the ATF later this yr in court. Easily fixed by the Congress changing the definition of a "machine gun". But, the fix "died" in Committee, just like the victims (past and future). Can the children fix it?#NRA

1314 2018-05-19 14:09:47 I have checked the locator for AB24, yeah. The H&B it lists doesn't stock 500ml tubs, only overly expensive minis. Only the Sainbury's stocks the 500ml chocolate but no other flavour, not even vanilla anymore. Sad times.
1315 2018-05-19 14:09:47 There is a thought process behind every investment. Every fund manager's investment style is different and should be respected. Clearly he mentioned that the stocks are of more Value than the price. @porinju #Respect
1316 2018-05-19 14:08:35 Careful with that though, it’s driven by an artificial and potentially reversible boosted referral reward program. Less about fundamentals. Brokerages used to do this all the time with shit stocks they wanted out of....double the brokers commission in it. Shows desperation.

1320 2018-05-19 14:01:31 Assault rifles and bump stocks have no use in public but is money, If the gun violence is illuminated from the movie industry, the next shooter may not imagine his fame and finale statement, but the entertainment industry would collapse. Again, money.
1321 2018-05-19 14:00:15 *Ban on assault rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks.
*Mandatory Universal background check, 10 day waiting period.
*Mandatory liability insurance for gun owners.
*Gun locks and/or gun safes.

1345 2018-05-19 13:36:37 The “ban assault rifles” cliche is not a solution, banning bump stocks helped and I can even agree with limiting magazine sizes but VA tech happened with pistols and the knife analogy shows that people who want to do bad will do bad so it has to be more than “get rid of guns”

4) Ban assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks

1364 2018-05-19 13:08:48 @LOVELIV Most stocks that have significant rallies rarely continue much more than 20% before pulling back. Market conditions however dictate
1365 2018-05-19 13:07:40 Yes. Murders will always occurs in society, but it’s kind of difficult to kill large numbers of people in a short time with knives. 
I am not against gun ownerhsip for hunting, target shooting, or self protection, but semiautomatic rifles, large magazines, & bum stocks? Yes.

1380 2018-05-19 12:45:51 hmm, Las Vegas massacre was last October - 8 months ago - bump stocks SHOULD HAVE BEEN a no-brainer, but still legal - who are you trying to BS with this 'Trump taking action' LIE?????

1386 2018-05-19 12:36:21 You have to wonder at the cognitive dissonance after every shooting to blame something other than guns - mental health, bump stocks, too many doors, family breakdown, politics.  It doesn’t matter just as long as we don’t say the word guns.  If you say guns you’re the problem.

1400 2018-05-19 12:20:55 Background checks with NO loopholes. Ban all semiautomatics, bump stocks, all of it, except for the military. And stop defunding mental health programs. The same jerks who want to defund everything cause they hate paying taxes fight for universal gun ownership. Sick.

1409 2018-05-19 12:13:29 If nifty keeps replacing the stocks which are underperforming with the ones at 52 week high inspite of thr underlying earning thn it isn't the correct reflection of true picture of what's going on outside the main index! Most the fundamentaly good stocks are testing 52 week lows!
1410 2018-05-19 12:11:00 If you trade stocks at all today would be a GREAT buypoint  for snapchat if you're looking for a quick earning, it's at a 1 year low and is only temporary from a bad quarterly report. Short term a solid 1-4% gain within a week, long-term 10-20% over the course of the next quarter

1. If you are a small/medium cap investor, you need to have a strong gut to withstand 30-40% drawdowns. Another option is to go in & out of stocks & sit on cash when valuations too rich.
 
OR

2. Choose slow compounders. 

Best to be AWARE of your investing style.
1413 2018-05-19 12:05:15 Why are guns easier to get than cold medicine?

Require background checks for all purchases. 
Raise purchase age to 21. 
Close the gun show loophole. 
Ban extended magazines and bump stocks.
Ban AR-15s and similar weapons for civilian purchase.

Do not get me wrong, RV is a great service, but you have been biased (gold, short sellers, amagedon sellers, system- and Fed-bashers).

1445 2018-05-19 11:23:23 No one is trying to take away your right to own a gun. Sure, have a rifle and a pistol for protection. Do you need bump stocks? Do you need a stock pile like Paddock? Trust me, relaxed gun laws are why America has 7x the gun deaths per capita as Canada. Fact.

1456 2018-05-19 11:10:04 To me it doesn't make sense to trade FX strategies without symmetrical long/short entries. FX pairs, as opposed to stocks and commodities, should behave the same way on both the long and short side. I think it's curve fitting. Don't you think?

1503 2018-05-19 09:52:30 Yes, I want them to be taught gun safety and respect for guns. 

What do you consider a private seller? How many guns are transferred that way? Is there any laws prohibiting a restricted person from owning a gun?

I've already agreed to better background checks, bump stocks gone

1523 2018-05-19 09:26:22 Nice suggestions. But, how about improving background checks? Banning bump stocks? Banning military style assault rifles? Raising the age to get guns? Closing the gun show loophole? You know, anything that would actually help stop this. #RepealAndReplaceLeeZeldin
1524 2018-05-19 09:21:15 In this shooting, no assault weapon was used. The shotgun was legally purchased by an owner who passed a background check. No “bump stocks” were involved. Tell me which “common sense” gun reform short of mass confiscation would have prevented this.

1562 2018-05-19 08:35:04 The common belief of saying don't invest what you can't afford to loose, that's true with traditional stocks, though BCH looks similar to that at moment - in long term it's actually much safer! i.e. I would say it's more dangerous doing nothing with fiat or leaving it in a bank!.

1621 2018-05-19 07:21:32 Trump uses everything for personal vengeance!  If they do not support him, he starts attacking and makes up vicious lies about them! No one does much because we all know he’s lying.  But when stocks dip, it is time to sue Trump for every dime he has, including Rubles.  Go WAPO!!!

1628 2018-05-19 07:16:26 I think Lupin (CMP 740), Sun Pharma (CMP 460) will be 1000+ and 600+ within 12 months. Also think SAIL (CMP 71) will see 120+. National Aluminium (CMP 73) should go to 100+. A small cap Aksh Optifibres (CMP 32) should do 60+. 

Any opinions on these stocks?

1633 2018-05-19 07:14:42 Storage is common sense. Take/keep guns from mentally ill, common sense.  Ban bump stocks, common sense.  Something has to change.  Keeping things the same and expecting a different outcome, is lunacy and NOT common sense.

@realDonaldTrump has yet to deliver a single #2A victory thus far.

Gorsuch? SCOTUS refused to hear 2A cases
Bump stocks?
#GunControl is sweeping the nation. 
Trump nominated an anti-2A judge for the 9th Circuit.

Trump is NOT a defender of the 2A

1642 2018-05-19 07:06:32 argues well for the company. The stock can give handsome returns provided management is able to tap the opportunities available in the sector.

Not sure if comparing it with returns posted by tyre stocks would make sense at the point of time... Though both belong to same sector!

1676 2018-05-19 06:18:16 2 yrs back I researched 10 porinju stocks & invested 10% in 10 Stocks.  Till date 2 have given multibagger(>5x) returns. My portfolio > 100%.  Don’t buy 1 of his recommendations and brand him. He is an awesome undervalued investor & a good person trying to educate ppl on equity.
1677 2018-05-19 06:17:23 Oh, there’s definitely a lot that goes into it. Culture, gun law, mental health. It just seems to me that the first step should be stricter laws regarding background checks as well as the ban of unnecessary shit like fully automatics, large magazines, and bump stocks
1678 2018-05-19 06:15:27 No. Why do assume that any hint of “gun control” means confiscation of all weapons? I’ll answer that for you: because it’s easier to set up a straw man and argue against that than it is to argues against things like universal background checks or banning of sales of bump stocks.
1679 2018-05-19 06:12:50 If you Ban bump stocks and AR15s you would not have done anything to stop this.
1680 2018-05-19 06:12:41 Most “AR” are semi auto which means single shot, bumps stocks are illegal to obtain without the proper paper.
1681 2018-05-19 06:11:49 Yeah that's the ticket, take them all out of school & just make schools illegal & make  teaching illegal but keep those assault weapons& bump stocks selling  &  but don't let any kids go to those places that sell guns & that's how we keep our kids safe.  Snark

1687 2018-05-19 06:08:16 you ar talking physical RE. Stocks too would display the effect, no?

@sharadjhun too of same opinion on RE stocks - we had a chat around 15 days back
1688 2018-05-19 06:05:02 Last week, we talk about stocks and bonds, a topic in his Eco subject. My son will be here for a weekend before hell week and I'm sure he'll ask about quo warranto and other hot news last week.

JEAIRWAYS, STAR, ADANIPOWER, HCC, RCOM (Even after 80% single day jump), PCJWELLER, JPASSOCIAT, RPOWER, ALBK, IFCI
Just joking there was no split. it's 50 draw down from 2018 high.
1690 2018-05-19 06:00:52 1. Raise age limit to 21 to buy a gun.
2. Ban semi-automatics and bump stocks.
3. Hold gun owners responsible if their gun is used in a crime with a heavy fine to encourage them to keep their guns secure.
4. Refuse donations from @NRA.
1691 2018-05-19 06:00:50 Bollocks. No one has said that all guns should be banned. What is the problem taking bump stocks and high capacity magazines away or restricting guns from the mentally ill or those with criminal backgrounds?
1692 2018-05-19 06:00:33 Nice video Andy,  who stocks those?  Lois well handy with side movement
1693 2018-05-19 05:59:00 We clearly need more guns in red states!

Can we start a charity and just send boxes of loaded rifles with bump stocks to the redneck-infested parts of the country?
1694 2018-05-19 05:57:41 And ban certain assault rifles & bump stocks...anything else that makes such atrocities so damn easy
1695 2018-05-19 05:53:37 I’m guessing that planting corn and soybeans from payment to payment is “market driven” considering the record stocks we’ve had for 5+ years.  Where are the tomato and asparagus farmers I all of this outrage?
1696 2018-05-19 05:52:27 just think as a normal citizen . country is burning and the PM is busy in state elections it shows  country is trouble and things are getting worse . the debt is worse but they are too busy in headline management.they can rig stocks but not CURRENCY mkts
1697 2018-05-19 05:51:43 Depends on what you consider assault rifles. Only reason ar15s are allowed is because NRA found a loophole to make them classified "sport". NO you don't have to take a safety class in the majority of states. Bump stocks are relevant. NO background checks at many sales.
1698 2018-05-19 05:47:07 thank you for your feedback , we are constantly working towards bringing more and more stocks for our users. Rest assured, we will make positive progress and get this sorted at the earliest.
1699 2018-05-19 05:46:17 How does that help with a student that brings a few pistols in his backpack?  He’s already in the school with his guns.  Unless everyone is walking thru a metal detector, which...I guess but stocks in metal detector companies?
1700 2018-05-19 05:44:39 Sure. Possibilities include but are not limited to: Close gun show and private sale loopholes, ban high capacity mags, standardized & mandatory background checks, ban assault weapons, require licensing, training, and insurance, increase age from 18 to 21, ban bump stocks, etc.
1701 2018-05-19 05:43:22 We already have background checks, databases (when LE feels like pursuing them), you take a safety/proficiency course for CC license, assault rifles are already banned, bump stocks are irrelevant, there are already penalties for breaking existing laws.
1702 2018-05-19 05:42:27 Fortunately, the NRA doesn’t have the same grip on Hawai`i that it does in Congress.  We banned bump stocks this year & shortened the time to dispose of your firearms if you commit a disqualifying act such as a felony.
1703 2018-05-19 05:42:04 come on, you come out talking bump stocks...he used a shot gun and .38...kid was bullied by peers and coaches for years but the only story on BOTH sides is guns...dumb
1704 2018-05-19 05:39:18 Tight*

Guess that flat line threw you?

And FL & VT among states passing laws since Parkland...signed by republican governors. Cities banning bump stocks and assault weapons.

2A cosplay time is over.
1705 2018-05-19 05:37:41 I agree, they don't.  Nobody needs an AR-15.  However, it protected under the 2nd A.  I don't believe people need large magazines or bump stocks, either.  But, it is still not going to stop shootings.  It never will.  And, this kid in Santa Fe used a revolver.
1706 2018-05-19 05:36:49 $AMGN and $NVS got FDA approval for their groundbreaking migraine drug and their stocks barely moved. So what makes you think $PTN will?

1710 2018-05-19 05:28:57 1. Raise age limit to 21 to buy a gun.
2. Ban semi-automatics and bump stocks.
3. Hold gun owners responsible if their gun is used in a crime with a heavy fine to encourage them to keep their guns secure.
4. Refuse donations from @NRA.

1712 2018-05-19 05:24:21 Then show some character and stand up to the @NRA. Make it illegal to sell assault weapons and ban bump stocks in Texas. You know, do something that actually helps people live.

1731 2018-05-19 04:56:22 Need to understand more. Don't look at individual stocks enough. Will have that chat with you sometime.
1732 2018-05-19 04:55:48 It’s absolutely wild being an Independent in this political climate. If you tell a conservative person that you don’t think military grade assault rifles with bump stocks are necessary for civilians you will get called a libtard snowflake.
1733 2018-05-19 04:54:12 You can look online to see if they have it in stocks.
1734 2018-05-19 04:52:22 It'd be cool if there was a non NRA gun owners organization that, like, would agree bump stocks are fucking stupid to begin with, and things like that. Or like denounce murderers. Or support gun owners whose rights are trampled even when they're black. That kinda stuff.
1735 2018-05-19 04:48:34 Dear readers. Don't go to theater today, pile up your stocks Of chips and cold drinks/beer., you can hope to watch the live telecast of Karnataka floor test. Drama guaranteed, we already had from 15 may and it is likely to reach its climax.
1736 2018-05-19 04:48:31 Stocks always go up and down. Last few years many market participants forgot that stocks go down. But if you look at annual returns of Nifty, you would know its a frequently occurring phenomena. Stocks will rise again.

1741 2018-05-19 04:41:22 just imagine how the people that chose to invest in specific stocks like netflix, google, or even apple are living.
1742 2018-05-19 04:41:12 They acted Hillary! While you were in India still spreading crap about the election loss, Congress passed laws to fund schools 64B & banned bump stocks, increased mental illness treatment & the money was sent to all schools to protect the students!
1743 2018-05-19 04:40:47 Well, maybe not on all that stuff... But universal background checks and banning bump stocks are two that would be easy af.
1744 2018-05-19 04:39:49 Blankets and warm clothes can be taken off the shelf. What they need is food, water, shelter and decent jobs. That takes effort and commitment. Let's see some action rather than token offers from stocks.
1745 2018-05-19 04:38:44 As useful as it maybe to blame MF's for the current weakness in a lot of stocks, fact is that market breadth started to deteriorate from much earlier times.
1746 2018-05-19 04:38:19 In the field of common stocks, a little bit of a great many can never be more than a poor substitute for a few of the outstanding.
1747 2018-05-19 04:37:36 LAWS ALREADY CHANGED! BUMP STOCKS BANNED, AGE INCREASED, WAITING PERIODS INCREASED FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH & SCHOOL SAFETY WAS ALL DONE BY FEDERAL GOVT! NO ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY HAS DONE MORE SO QUICKLY!
1748 2018-05-19 04:37:13 Please, lets ban bump stocks and make them NFA items. Nothing changes for me because I can legally own NFA items because I am not a criminal. Once banned my bump stock becomes 100x more valuable and I sell it to someone else legally able to buy it then I'm rich! 
1749 2018-05-19 04:36:03 Someone brought a baby in startbar... wtf
1750 2018-05-19 04:32:34 No. I don’t believe in taking all guns. Reduce magazine sizes, not cut mental health programs, let the CDC study gun violence, close gun show loopholes, background checks, ban bump stocks...
1751 2018-05-19 04:28:32 i think you’re doing it wrong
1752 2018-05-19 04:26:58 And many agree that bump stocks should be banned, even those on the right. Trump is actually working on banning them. The NRA is even open to the idea.
1753 2018-05-19 04:26:06 “Buy me some blue chip stocks.” “I’ll buy you some blue corn tortilla chips.”

1756 2018-05-19 04:20:37 How many times have I blown up my account whether stocks or crypto? Several. How many times have I regrouped and come back? More. It’s not a job it’s a lifestyle

1781 2018-05-19 03:50:35 More often, we tend to analyse charts and forecast the movements of stocks prices the very next day, month or quarter. We hardly focus on the business potential.

As @pvsubramanyam clearly mentioned yesterday - There are people who bought Avanti Feeds at 20 and sold at 30.
1782 2018-05-19 03:49:37 I think there needs change but removing weapons that people use responsibly is not the answer.  Size of magazines, bump stocks, better background checks etc.
1783 2018-05-19 03:49:23 Which will you support in #TXlege:

*universal background checks
*gun violence restraining orders
*funding for school security
*mandatimg that guns in the home be stored and locked
*ban on bump stocks, large cap mags, assault weapons
*gun buy backs (recycle the guns - no resale)
1784 2018-05-19 03:47:48 I'm not advocating for abolishment of second amendment. But for establishing common sense gun laws like Detailed background checks, Mandatory waiting period, ban on Assualt Rifles and Bump stocks.
NRA has fought tooth and nail to avoid this conversation.

1787 2018-05-19 03:46:14 Debates about centralised vs decentralised crypto are simplistic and binary. It is a bit like selling stocks if you believe the CEO is authoritarian. Sometimes that may be the right answer. Sometimes execution requires a small wise and decisive group to grab land. Nuances matter.
1788 2018-05-19 03:45:32 @rtrowe I would never ask you which stocks to buy ... I would never tell someone which stocks to buy. Do your research and make a decision yourself. I know that can be annoying. I just really and truly want someone to bounce my thoughts and concerns off of.

1791 2018-05-19 03:41:31 True, but for a mass shooter, having an AR is a huge advantage over a handgun. Maximum casualties in shortest time period. The Las Vegas shooter would simply not have been able to fire over 1000 rounds and shoot 500 people without the benefit of ARs and bump stocks.

1794 2018-05-19 03:38:52 I thought the size/style just rotate among themselves, and it is better to just buy and hold if the stocks are good companies. Like what you and your father were advising.

1805 2018-05-19 03:21:24 I'd love to short all these stocks especially Tesla and Netflix, timing it is whats risky about it. Netflix's cash burn of $1 billion per quarter is nothing short of astounding, plus they have about $30 billion in liabilities they have to pay to content creators in medium term

1808 2018-05-19 03:19:22 Averaging down = horrible strategy. Set a stop. If you get stopped out watch for a bottom with confirmation of reversal. I've seen so many stocks go from cents to dollars back to cents. Missed runs are so much easier to get over than holding bags. #trustmeIknow

1811 2018-05-19 03:17:49 Im also for banning certain attachments such as bump stocks and custom triggers that allow firing at a much higher rate. But for me to vote for an official strictly to try out gun control means I’d have to be okay with all the other viewpoints they have, which I wouldn’t be.
1812 2018-05-19 03:17:39 We made our gun stocks in shop class.

1817 2018-05-19 03:14:01 Your second A is not in jeopardy, you fool. Laws instituting background checks, so people with mental illness, or previous crimes cannot purchase guns. NRA stands in the way of these laws because they would slow and reduce gun sales which hurts stocks, stocks held by the NRA....

1823 2018-05-19 03:09:13 Any lawmaker who holds any stocks of any kind and then votes for or against laws that favor that stock is extremely unethical and should be forced to sell their stocks or step down. This is a HUGE conflict of interest and should be illegal. We constituents deserve better.
1824 2018-05-19 03:08:41 Our forefathers believed that people should have the right to bear arms to protect themselves and our country. I do not believe they were advocating for bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons #guns
1825 2018-05-19 03:08:35 The 2nd amendment is not synonymous with the NRA. The NRA, like cuckservstives, are habitual compromisers. Shall not be infringed =/= ban bump stocks because feels. Remember this.
1826 2018-05-19 03:07:05 Hey John....do you have a middle ground solution to the mass shootings? Or is it just your side’s utopia or bust? Just arm everyone with assault rifles and bump stocks, and hope for the best?
1827 2018-05-19 03:05:38 I used to just believe in universal background checks. I used to believe in just a ban on bump stocks and assault rifles. Now I want to watch every gun forcibly taken away and melted while the white trash that owned it cries.

Oh my !
Nice try but Bary & Slick Willie did NO such thing !
Bary is the one who legalized "bump stocks" !
Slick Willie is the one who burned down the Branch Davidians home & church !
Slick Willie is the one who shot Randy Weaver's UNARMED wife & baby !
1831 2018-05-19 03:02:55 Took 4 stocks. We got this.
1832 2018-05-19 03:02:42 Bump stocks? Yeah maybe. But what is a bump stock exactly? Simply it’s a device that uses the the momentum of the previous round’s inertia to cause the shooter to pull the trigger again. They’re not practical and most people never heard of them until we were told about Vegas .
1833 2018-05-19 03:02:15 I feel like after this combine a lot of stocks have been shooting up. A lot of talent in this draft. At least 5 or 6 realistic options for LA at 25 I would not mind.
1834 2018-05-19 03:02:03 see it and value it accordingly," the Mayberry CEO said.
The listing of MJEL means that investors can opt for that stock, instead of buying individual stocks or a unit trust portfolio, Peart reasoned.

"Some people have an equity fund that they buy into, but instead, you can just
1835 2018-05-19 03:01:46 Randy I feel that you also know that Individual stocks will beat out index funds if you know what you are doing. I can appreciate them doing this though because most "investors" are actually "speculators"
1836 2018-05-19 03:00:54 Of course there is always the difference between good and bad stocks - bad ones might never come up again once beaten down.
1837 2018-05-19 03:00:14 That’s how stocks works, you might loom money in the beginning like most stocks until the company really takes off.  Hope you didn’t sell them back.
1838 2018-05-19 02:59:44 What specifics do you want? His stances are largely in line with nearly all democrats (& some Republicans): better background checks, mental health, bump stocks, safe storage, etc. He's got to appeal to everyone and find areas of agreeability & common ground like Conor Lamb did.

1843 2018-05-19 02:57:33 As far as bump stocks go it’s a gimmick. It can also be done with just a rubber band as bump firing is a technique not a technology

Oh that's right,  almost forgot.  
You approved bump stocks.

1860 2018-05-19 02:39:20 And do you do this by spread bets or conventional equity holdings? Do you play around in the derivatives markets at all? Warrants? (I realise that the small cap stocks which you favour are fairly illiquid already and that derivatives don't exist for those names)...but for Next?
1861 2018-05-19 02:38:02 I think some of the most heavily owned stocks,ie FANG, would be a good place to start. Hedge funds are going to head for the exits all at once as the momentum reverses. A one-sided illiquid selloff will define the coming bear market. As a result the unwind will be steep & swift.
1862 2018-05-19 02:35:32 if I can throw this out there: I think there's a substantial difference between fantasy and real life in these contexts. The to the day valuation of prospects is relevant in a fantasy context because they're essential stocks/assets and in that context I can see the value in (1/2)

1864 2018-05-19 02:33:14 HEG, BEPL, Mid cap IT, some consumption stocks are perfect examples of performing small and mid caps in the market. Pick great individual stocks. You shall be rewarded. Pick crap, and you will be treated like that.
1865 2018-05-19 02:32:01 In fact, these tokens often offer more real value than stocks even, such as in the form of staking, direct governance, and so forth. I agree that sometimes tokens are shoehorned into projects to conceal a plain IPO-style fundraiser though.
1866 2018-05-19 02:31:31 No they weren't. The guns were legally bought. The bump stocks that were used to basically turn them into automatic weapons were legal. Don't lie to try to support you position.

1868 2018-05-19 02:30:29 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
1869 2018-05-19 02:30:03 Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. forex stocks
1870 2018-05-19 02:29:04 Ask the people that buy the tokens. Or the people that buy stocks in IPOs or on the free market. Or in terms of non-fungible assets, ask people that buy paintings or old wine. There is very little that has intrinsic value. It's all down to social agreement and sentiment.
1871 2018-05-19 02:28:55 Its time SEBI allows bear funds, long only funds lead to excesses so corrections tend to be brutal in low liquidity stocks. Shorts act as liquidity providers in times like these.
1872 2018-05-19 02:28:53 @realDonaldTrump No one wants to hear your fake concern, and sympathetic platitudes.  What we want is real gun reform. 

-Comprehensive nationwide background checks
-No more gun show sales without background checks
-Ban assault style weapons 
-Ban bump stocks

1874 2018-05-19 02:27:20 Agree on EC, critical to maintain. I trade longer time frames -stocks can trade sideways for weeks/months, critical for my time frame to let it play out. Have to fight locking in profit, versus letting it play out
1875 2018-05-19 02:26:40 @GOP @SpeakerRyan Let’s keep the conversation on military grade assault weapons and bump stocks that are too easily accessible and keep killing children at school and let WOMEN manage their own bodies in 2018. Thank you.
1876 2018-05-19 02:25:40 There's been a lot of debate lately (on my twitter) about AVERAGING DOWN.  If you ask any veteran trader, they will say it's one of the things they never do.  The reason is simple - They've seen stocks go up AND down.
1877 2018-05-19 02:23:11 I know theres a lot more to it. I was just trying to break it down between the two sides. They want no bump stocks, and automatic weapon sales. Such as the AR-15. And stronger background checks which I agree with. Kids need to be safe.
1878 2018-05-19 02:21:44 Some of my friends told their portfolio reduced 30-50% in last couple of days,when I asked abt stocks most of them are from smallcaps,infra,PSB's,when market is bullish everything looks fine,plz read "Ben Graham" "Investment definition" before investing in equities.

1895 2018-05-19 02:08:45 Bump stocks make semi automatics work essentially as fully automatics. Fully automatics are used in war. Stopping sale of bump stocks does not infringe on the 2A - but it prevents semi automatic to act as a weapon (fully automatic) used in war.

I'm ok w/ppl having legal guns...handguns & hunting rifles. To this day I've not heard one valid reason for bump stocks & automatic weapons in everyday society.
1904 2018-05-19 01:59:36 It boggles my mind that pro #2A can’t see the need to ban bump stocks, assault weapons (let’s be honest the govt tanks alone would just roll right over your militia), background checks, insurance, licensing, and legal action to the gun owners whose guns are used in a crime!
1905 2018-05-19 01:59:10 And the argument that Trump is great because of the tax cuts and my stocks perform well, and I just ignore the rest...well, frankly I think your voting rights should be revoked.  That position lacks a certain maturity needed to vote. Ta Loco 
1906 2018-05-19 01:58:28 Over 90% of Americans favor increased gun control including background checks for all buyers, raising the legal age and banning bump stocks.  Yet, Republicans will not even bring these issue to the floor.  Take you rural vs. City arguement somewhere else.  Over 90%!

1933 2018-05-19 01:42:18 Is averaging up when you buy new stocks in a company that you already own when the price is higher, thus increasing the average purchase price? Sorry for the noob question.
1934 2018-05-19 01:40:42 Not anymore automatic than a pistol. One trigger squeeze, one round. If you rattle off rounds, you're not aiming. That's why bump-stocks are absolutely useless.
1935 2018-05-19 01:39:50 Yes, a bump stock can create a somewhat faster rate of fire. You will not hear much complaints from gun owners if bills were proposed to make bump stocks harder to obtain. I personally do not see a need for them besides being fun.
1936 2018-05-19 01:39:03 Honest answer — ban bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles. I own hand guns, shot guns, and hunting rifles. Anything additional is excessive. Fund mental health and mandatory background checks on all gun sales.

1964 2018-05-19 01:22:56 @DanPatrickTX Your comments about exits are a disgrace to the state of Texas. And we need sensible gun control in this state also. Banning bump stocks and Ar15 is good government.  #Resistance
1965 2018-05-19 01:20:07 For starters, assault weapons and bump stocks need to be banned. You kill a maximum number of people in minimum time.  All the recent mass shootings were with a legally obtained AR-15.
1966 2018-05-19 01:17:52 When the Dems wanted to block the sale of bump stocks which allow semi auto to fire essentially automatically did the reps refuse and act like the Vegas shooter had more of a right than the people he killed?
1967 2018-05-19 01:17:40 From abc13:  “Authorities say Pagourtzis was armed with a shotgun and a .38 revolver that belonged to his father. They believe those weapons were legally owned by his father.”

Stands to reason we should ban ARs, bump stocks, and semi-auto revolvers.  And shotguns.  Right Biden?

1970 2018-05-19 01:16:25 Its sad to say politicians turbed the parkland survivors into a joke these kids have no idea whats going on and do something? Raising gun age wouldnt have helped,banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and extended mags wouldnt have helped

1973 2018-05-19 01:15:15 :Eliminating bump stocks
:No gun sales to those convicted of DV
:Keep Military-style "assault" weapons out of civilian hands (and I swear if you go at me for using the wrong terminology when you absolutely know what I'm talking about, I'm done.)
1974 2018-05-19 01:13:57 School safety is primarily a state issue. Not a federal issue. Trump is in the process of banning bump stocks.
1975 2018-05-19 01:11:21 Stocks plunged as Arrow Electronics, Inc unveiled a critical game cartridge today.

1977 2018-05-19 01:10:36 Trump pick buys stocks, raises scrutiny Cards a 76 at Torrey Pines in Tour Return -- Guided Tour of Britain & Ireland in 13 Nights Would Make Sense for Both Sides
1978 2018-05-19 01:10:09 The only incident I can find that a gun that was illegally modified to be fully automatic and was used in a shooting was the North Hollywood shootout. If you are referring to bump fire stocks no modification is required to bump fire a gun. You can bump fire with just your finger.
1979 2018-05-19 01:09:29 I have 10-11% of my portfolio in pharma industries (3 companies) and it is in loss of 25-30%, holding period 1-2 years. I am bullish on some consumption stocks & air conditioners and cement/construction. pharma for me was contra bet. now, what do you recommend?
1980 2018-05-19 01:07:49 Hahaha yeah, good for her! I read somewhere before as well that Birkin was voted a better investment than stocks/gold 
1981 2018-05-19 01:06:57 Oh good things like the tax bill that allowed all these companies to buy back stocks while the middle class gets $20 extra a paycheck!!   What other good things is he doing??
1982 2018-05-19 01:06:51 We can do better than the nothing advocated by NRA.

1992 2018-05-19 01:02:53 First we wanted to ban semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.  Will shotguns and .38 pistols be next?  What's next?  Materials used for explosives?  Knives?  Bats?  Brass knuckles?  Vehicles?  How about after you choose to have children you teach them morals and right vs. wrong?

We need 2 know not just about the NRA money-

2000 2018-05-19 00:54:00 I have to believe their are many small improvements to the current system would help, especially with regard to how, where, when, by who and about whom the background check system works. I would add bump stocks to the list of restricted items via Class III licensing.
2001 2018-05-19 00:53:53 Keep the "thoughts and prayers".  Ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, take weapons from domestic abusers, increase background checks.
2002 2018-05-19 00:53:47 Didn’t he write an EO to stop the sale of bump stocks? I guess that was BS too.

2025 2018-05-19 00:40:48 Almost all guns used today are semi-automatic including, of course, 9mm pistols.  Bump stocks simply speed up the individual trigger pulls of a semi-automatic but do not change the internal mechanics of the rifle.  It is still a semi-automatic.  
FYI  I oppose bump stocks.

2032 2018-05-19 00:33:43 He wasn’t emboldened by president Trump.  

Trump has actually called for increased security in public schools and the ban bump stocks.

“Stop play dumb” doesn’t make you seem any smarter.  You’re significantly lost .
2033 2018-05-19 00:30:05 Here are additional examples of security protocol: universal background checks, raise minimum age to purchase assault-stye weapons, universal ban of bump stocks, universal ban on firearms purchase by the mentally ill, federal law requiring all gun owners to secure their weapons.

2036 2018-05-19 00:27:39 @Marlins_Man automatic firearms are banned. Modifications like bump stocks allow for semi-automatic weapons to act like fully automatic weapons.

2043 2018-05-19 00:21:25 We can argue about how we get there but no one needs an AR-15 assault rifle, bump stocks or high capacity ammo clips! Strengthening background checks & closing gun show loophole is a no-brainer, criminalizing straw purchases is a no-brainer &

2051 2018-05-19 00:17:15 I believe the Firearms Act of 1934 shows pretty clearly that gun control works. Why did Steven Paddock choose bump stocks over an automatic rifle? I don't want to restrict more weapons, though. But I think we should stop crazies, nazis and terrorists from getting guns, at all.

2057 2018-05-19 00:14:51 If we would just get rid of bump stocks this wouldn't have happened. If they would just get rid of the AR-15 This wouldn't have happened. Oh wait a minute,  that wouldn't have helped here.

2062 2018-05-19 00:12:37 Wait, Mr Painter... You're inferring POTUS can front run stocks?
2063 2018-05-19 00:12:34 What the hell kind of comment is this anyway.  You are an embarrassment to this country.  Stop taking NRA money.  Ban assault weapons, expand background checks, ban bump stocks. Do something besides playing golf and hiding out at Trump properties.
2064 2018-05-19 00:12:07 Thx .@JohnKasich for getting the ball rolling on common sense regs to protect our citizens:  tightening NICS, banning bump stocks & armor-piercing ammo, red-flagging, & closing 3rd-party gun sale loopholes, while still protecting #2A. #CommonSenseGunRegulations #CountryOverParty

2075 2018-05-19 00:04:43 Sawed off shotguns do not have a legitimate self-defense purpose (bump stocks don't either) and are thus not protected by the 2nd amendment.

But...
AR-15s have a self-defense purpose 
...as do short barreled rifles
...as do suppressors.

The NFA is still unconstitutional.

2079 2018-05-19 00:02:27 AR-15 is not an umbrella term. It is the name of a specific type of firearm built on a specific platform designed to allow for durability, customization (custom stocks, etc. to fit different sized people) and easier fixing.

2084 2018-05-20 23:58:23 No one is saying the gun grew legs and shot people itself. What the “puke liberals” want is sensible gun control. Universal background checks, ending gun show loopholes, penalties for parents that are irresponsible, and bans on bump stocks and 100 round clips.
2085 2018-05-20 23:57:06 Even though I think bump stocks are dumb. You do realize they completely make any kind of accuracy impossible right?
2086 2018-05-20 23:56:54 Yeah, that’s not happening. Dems are fighting for comprehensive gun reform, stricter background checks, closing loopholes at gun shows, raising the age of purchase, getting rid of military style weapons for civilian purchase, getting rid of bump stocks, etc. 

Reps do nothing.
2087 2018-05-20 23:56:46 Getting into stocks and bonds. That conversation me and my brother @972MrBAM had yesterday opened my mind up.
2088 2018-05-20 23:56:39 But none of these mass shooters got their guns through loopholes. Since you want accountability let’s start charging the ones that are really responsible with accessory to murder..ie FBi, Sheriff, school officials, bully’s...etc. That will do more than banning bump stocks.
2089 2018-05-20 23:56:14 Ban bump stocks!
2090 2018-05-20 23:56:11 Please, stocks up, jobs up, taxes down, terrorist getting whipped...he's awesome

2092 2018-05-20 23:52:42 Universal Background checks at every point of sale
Some sort of bio-trigger so only vetted gun-owner can shoot a given gun
Regular license renewal w/ gun safety checks
21 min age
Limits on ammo purchases
Limits on magazine size
National ban on bump stocks
What is you solution?
2093 2018-05-20 23:52:27 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks! Civilians do not need these.
2094 2018-05-20 23:52:25 Message to text voicemail services should be banned by law and anyone who uses them should be locked in stocks and thrown in a river.
2095 2018-05-20 23:51:44 Enough with the bump stocks already!
2096 2018-05-20 23:51:13 No stress? Lol. You can never be certain with penny stocks especially on the CSE.

2100 2018-05-20 23:49:08 That’s straight NRA talking points. Zero gun regulations. How bout ban bump stocks, stip gun shows skirting background , ban semi autos? 
2101 2018-05-20 23:48:46 @RobinhoodApp what's your view on giving users the option to create menus for different stocks, in mobile app? ( and maybe on the site too )(btw the ui is beautiful and the UX sets the standard)
2102 2018-05-20 23:47:23 Our founding fathers had a very different view of guns from what they looked like to what they shot. It was supposed to defend us from tyrants not kill children or club or concert goers. They didn't have semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. It was a one fire close range gun

2126 2018-05-20 23:44:01 I support banning bump stocks
2127 2018-05-20 23:43:48 I thought the flow between ten year and stocks was the market
well that what I got from @GregMannarino
2128 2018-05-20 23:42:00 Wow great returns you made that amount by buy stocks ?
2129 2018-05-20 23:39:18 Stocks or options trading.  Great job!
2130 2018-05-20 23:39:06 Ban Bump Stocks!
2131 2018-05-20 23:38:21 I’m not in office and I don’t play a politician on tv either. Bump stocks gone. 30 day waiting period do buy a hand gun. Extreme vetting in order at gun shows as well as stores in order to purchase one. Limits on magazines and calibers as well. That’s a start.
2132 2018-05-20 23:38:12 I'll believe it when I see it. Trump also promised banning bump stocks, AR15's, and red flag laws after Parkland - then went to a meeting with the NRA and backtracked everything. The only progress on that front is being done at the state level by grass root organizations
2133 2018-05-20 23:37:19 watching axe go for 69% in between stocks is so prime
2134 2018-05-20 23:36:23 We don’t need bump stocks. People can still keep their guns. Also we need to reform the way we treat people and the developmentally disabled. We need to study why this happens the most in the U.S.A and look at what other countries have done to stop or minimize these atrocities.
2135 2018-05-20 23:36:17 Banning bump stocks, promise made to Parkland students: NOT DONE. “I’m not afraid of the NRA” but then he caved and more kids are dead. Oh and, no one elected you or your husband. Stop wasting my money.
2136 2018-05-20 23:36:01 Ban  Bump stocks. Now !!!!
2137 2018-05-20 23:34:35 This does nothing to preserve life. It’s not even worth talking about bump stocks. Any tool can be used as weapon.

2140 2018-05-20 23:33:11 Maybe you should read filings before commenting on stocks. I will ignore you thanks
2141 2018-05-20 23:33:02 YOU LEFT OUT MENTAL HEALTH, BUMP STOCKS, GUNSHOW LOOPHOLES, BOUGHT AND PAID FOR REPUBLICANS BUY THE NRA.  THE RUSSIANS.  STOP LYING TO PEOPLE WE HAVE HUGE GUN ISSUES MY FRIEND AND WE NEED REAL LAWS.
2142 2018-05-20 23:33:02 I just sold $800 in stocks. I’m an adult 
2143 2018-05-20 23:32:49 Come up with solutions not criticism. People are dying & we need action not sarcasm. Note the Santa Fe shooter did not have as high a “kill count” due to a shot gun vs semiautomatic.  Their “candy” is infamy & a higher count than the last guy so take away bump stocks. Now!
2144 2018-05-20 23:31:54 Better yet, ignore me. When investors can’t explain the supply and undercutting, they need not look any further than the agreement. Plenty of ugly stocks engaged with Aspire. Can’t think of one who has seen growth because their agreement. Maybe you have. Ignore it and me. Thx
2145 2018-05-20 23:30:58 @C2Oswalt man check out these mini stocks
2146 2018-05-20 23:30:40 Lots to parse here. Easiest 2 are: of course he should be punished; no, the scarlett letter/public stocks model isn't one I'd choose in this the 21st century.
2147 2018-05-20 23:29:55 @Amber_Stocks still sticking to the 5 in 5 out hockey subbing.

2149 2018-05-20 23:26:49 WONDER how many stocks Leaders of the Dem Party have with CNN?  WONDER if Putin has bought stock with them?  Good questions all of them.
2150 2018-05-20 23:26:45 Brand new special offer for a limited time only: Buy 2 packs of Niqabs and get a free bomber jacket, yes that's right, you heard correctly!

2151 2018-05-20 23:26:29 Divide us really and I wasn’t talking about that bs I’m talking about Russia. He needs to stop talking and last time I checked when Obama was in office unemployment was at an all tome low stocks were at an all time high
2152 2018-05-20 23:26:18 Ban all bump stocks NOW!!
2153 2018-05-20 23:25:57 Because you totally can't go hunting or defend against a burglar without full auto.  And bump stocks are totally enough to keep a tyrannical government with tanks, fighter jets, and actual trained soldiers, at bay.
2154 2018-05-20 23:25:13 130 cars in the pits here at @OutagamieSpdwy!! 32 IMCA Mods, 32 IMCA Stocks, 28 Sport Mods, 20 Bombers, 18 Compacts
2155 2018-05-20 23:24:45 Ban All Bump Stocks NOW!!!
2156 2018-05-20 23:23:29 Seeing that @BestBuy has decided to axe it's Gamers Card Unlocked program, looks like GameStop will be back in business & Best Buy's game sales will take a GINORMOUS hit once memberships expire. Time to sell high on BB stocks n buy low @GameStop stocks! #HorribleDecision BestBuy!
2157 2018-05-20 23:23:08 No need for a civilian to have bump stocks
2158 2018-05-20 23:23:06 @elonmusk Hello Elon Musk! Do you cooperate in your Starlink-Project with NOKIA Networks? Got some stocks and I need to know if they hit rock bottom in 2025 or not.
2159 2018-05-20 23:22:12 I’m going to find out the NRA is just one old white dude with stocks in every gun importing business, ARENT I?
2160 2018-05-20 23:20:50 76 cars in the pits... 21 Midwest Modifieds... 17 Street Stocks... 13 Modifieds... 13 Late Models... 12 Super Stocks.... #casinospeedway2018
2161 2018-05-20 23:20:41 Sounds like a lot more random people and germs! Hope @Starbucks upgrades the way it sanitizes, disinfects, cleans and stocks it’s restrooms. More frequently. Stronger. You’ve increased your responsibility to paying $$$$ customers who expect a pleasant experience.
2162 2018-05-20 23:19:55 For those who don't know. In India we start the fast by a siren and not adhan. It sounds very similar to a war alert siren. And everyone stocks on last sips of water and food resources as if they are not gonna be available for a week....like a war
2163 2018-05-20 23:19:49 And with low wages and unemployed, nobody to buy goods & create production & more foods, so they buy back their own stocks, get richer and the system will collapse
2164 2018-05-20 23:18:45 Une soirée réussie c’est arriver avec un briquet bleu et partir avec un briquet rouge. Ce n’est pas compter les flux et les stocks. Merci Isabelle Sorente et #ParJupiter pour ces rappels d’humanité basique. @Charlineaparis @alexvizorek
2165 2018-05-20 23:18:04 stocks are the only game in town
2166 2018-05-20 23:17:37 Congrats!!! Baka naubusan na din Ng stocks sa dami Ng tao
2167 2018-05-20 23:16:52 Wow. I guess I'll finally be shopping elsewhere once my membership expires. GCU and the 20% off was the ONLY reason I purchased all my games from Best buy. And one of reasons BB was putting @GameStop out of business. With this news tho, maybe ppl should buy some GameStop stocks!!
2168 2018-05-20 23:16:47 Is Venezuela’s collapse temporary? What about the need for mid-distillates? The high API shale oil clearly isn’t cutting it as Singapore mid-disty stocks have blown through 2008 lows, in the face of massive demand growth. Shallow analysis like this reflects poorly on The Globe.
2169 2018-05-20 23:16:34 Am I the only one that wakes up in the middle of the night and start running stock scenarios in my head?

2174 2018-05-20 23:10:38 Nah. Maybe stocks
2175 2018-05-20 23:10:30 I'm for banning bump stocks and all military type of weaponry, and no, we don't need to *harden* schools, we have a GUN problem, not a school problem.

2179 2018-05-20 23:09:23 I find interesting that so many people want to emulate Warren Buffett’s investing principles, but would also think it’s insane to have 75% of their portfolio in 5 stocks.
2180 2018-05-20 23:09:19 先週チラ見した感じだと、稼ぎ頭の中国（２年前はテンバガーになるとお花畑になってしまったくらい）が赤字だったから、競合が増えて厳しいと決めつけたけど、そーじゃなかったんだね。

2181 2018-05-20 23:09:04 How far do the stocks rise when he really lies!! 
2182 2018-05-20 23:08:31 you think it was because there was a coordinated embargo on baby formula during that period and corporations which opposed the Venezuelan govt withheld or destroyed stocks
2183 2018-05-20 23:08:13 Any empirical evidence that banning bump stocks will do anything to curve the homicide rate?
2184 2018-05-20 23:07:52 Yes, I sure have. Have you? Tell me where the 2nd Amendment talks about bump stocks and AR-15s. I'm waiting.
2185 2018-05-20 23:07:46 Where in the constitution does it say you have the right to bump stocks? You can be “well armed” without a bumpstock
2186 2018-05-20 23:06:55 極楽湯。クソ決算だと思ってたけど、18年度予想が評価されてS高買い気配か。優待用100株のみで、S高でも含み損だけど、気分はいいね。
2187 2018-05-20 23:05:59 At what point do you stop playing golf- building private businesses, buy and sell stocks and rape and pillage the U.S. and our people.  When that happens, well, Robert Mueller won’t dtop@because then you need to go to prison
2188 2018-05-20 23:05:22 The futures are RIPPING right now on the China trade news (which still needs to be further developed/clarified), but still.... #Futures #Stocks #Green #China #ChinaTrade #Trade
2189 2018-05-20 23:03:54 This isn't money I'm investing for next year. The price of stocks will fluctuate. Besides 50% of gains sounds pretty good. In 2008 I lost 50% of value.
2190 2018-05-20 23:02:53 So companies buying back stocks and boosting just CEO pay is justified?
2191 2018-05-20 23:01:57 I agree with Emma! Ban Bump Stocks!
2192 2018-05-20 23:01:40 No guns needed for a 'revolution', it's called voting do-nothings out of office. If wanting safe places for students makes me a "filthy corrupt Democratic Party operative" so be it. Guns are fine, pass a background check, no bump stocks, want a military weapon, join the military.
2193 2018-05-20 23:01:35 Learn the existing laws and this would be self explanatory.
Pretty much every gun control law that  treats legal gun owners like would be criminals: transportation, storage, carrying, barrel lengths, stocks on pistols, magazine limits, the list is too long.
2194 2018-05-20 23:01:06 Please ban bump stocks. As an educator I am becoming disgusted by myself as I feel desensitized and disengaged by students being murdered. Canceling bump stocks is simple and logical. There is no justifiable reason to own a bump stock.
2195 2018-05-20 22:58:15 Still seeing a lot of early-stage oil stocks out there -- obviously the group is herky jerky but worth taking note of after their huge base-building efforts during the past year
2196 2018-05-20 22:57:29 The creatures in Donny's swamp made money short selling stocks.  They can now call off the pretend trade war and move onto the next scam using the Presidential office to line their pockets.
2197 2018-05-20 22:57:05 I’m canvassing my district. Sorry if I don’t answer quickly.

I’m for universal background checks and banning bump stocks.

But I want to actually fix it. You can’t ban guns effectively here.
2198 2018-05-20 22:57:04 2. Bump stocks are over rated
3. totally agre
4. Depends on the severity

2202 2018-05-20 22:54:04 i remember this one time in grade 6, my class was playing a game that involved buying stocks. i bought a part of gucci, thinking that it was a popular, cool brand, but everyone laughed at me cuz the stocks were low WELL WHO'S LAUGHING NOW?? #BBMAs #iVoteBTSBBMAs
2203 2018-05-20 22:53:58 And please remember that while banning bump stocks would be a good step, it should be considered the bare minimum in terms of sensible gun safety legislation.
2204 2018-05-20 22:52:17 Oui et non, defois les plats sa change mais pas forcément, c’est tout dépend les stocks
2205 2018-05-20 22:51:35 If the government takes your guns away right now, you realize that it will be under a Trump presidency with a majority of Republicans in the House and Senate, right? Trump's executive order banning bump stocks will do more to take your guns away than Obama ever did.

2208 2018-05-20 22:51:14 Ban bump stocks now
2209 2018-05-20 22:50:37 1. Gun buying age up to 21 2. Bump stocks banned 3. Universal background checks 4. Policies making it impossible for those who have been in abusive relationships, mental illnesses, or a criminal background to get a gun
2210 2018-05-20 22:50:07 Bump stocks are simply not necessary for public citizens
2211 2018-05-20 22:50:07 Pretty easy to add international and small cap stocks there at a good price if you want
2212 2018-05-20 22:49:55 Maybe because most chinese penny stocks dont have partnerships with blue chip businesses, e.g Elastos $ELA and SAIC Motors
2213 2018-05-20 22:47:35 One, bump stocks should be illegal. Two, he bought them legally and passed background checks so there's nothing that would've stopped him from attaining the rifles. Three, I didn't say there was a problem with the others. The topic is school shootings & I'm staying on that topic.
2214 2018-05-20 22:47:03 Ban Bump Stocks and the guns they work on too!
2215 2018-05-20 22:46:37 Loopholes? I think if you don’t know the person you’re selling to very well, you’d be stupid to not check them out. There was a solution to make this easy introduced, but it was not really considered. Bump stocks? Don’t have one, don’t want one.
2216 2018-05-20 22:45:58 Ban bump stocks now.
2217 2018-05-20 22:45:46 Woman talking bout stocks is sexy af to me 
2218 2018-05-20 22:44:16 Remember this same crap occurred under previous repubs, but people don't learn. What do we expect when millionaires & billionaires of shady character, along with their cronies, who hold fabulous amounts of oil stocks (to name one thing) in their portfolios, get in high office?
2219 2018-05-20 22:42:25 But bump stocks are NOT BANNED in every state. Most of the people who shoot up schools, churches, theaters, etc have legally purchased their weapons and also the bump stocks they have killed with.
2220 2018-05-20 22:42:20 Ban bump stocks
2221 2018-05-20 22:41:10 Where have bump stocks been used in a school shooting?  
2222 2018-05-20 22:40:28 I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock and there’s only one real reason why stocks go up.
2223 2018-05-20 22:39:52 Really? So you know that bump stocks are banned in EVERY STATE? It absolutely isn't true! Check each state's laws before you start calling TEENAGERS names! There is a word for people like you BULLIES!

2229 2018-05-20 22:37:06 Trade-able securities aren’t always only for accredited investors. This is why nonaccredited can purchase public stocks.
2230 2018-05-20 22:36:58 If you stare hard enough into the oily pores on the forehead of a man with receding hairline dreads- you get sucked into another dimension where the entire planet is a Spencer’s gifts store that only stocks “I see dumb people” shirts
2231 2018-05-20 22:36:29 G.E. bailing out of GREEN and investing in MINING and OIL. Their stocks lost half of the value under @BarackObama. NOW THAT'S FUNNY! Go Trump! #MAGA
2232 2018-05-20 22:34:34 Oh! That reminds me, I must buy up all stocks of suncream in Ireland and then issue a warning for everyone to buy sunscreen. I'll be rich I tell you rich!
2233 2018-05-20 22:34:33 I heard rumors JonTron has put in major stocks for SwampWipes
2234 2018-05-20 22:33:18 With the Fed now reversing course, will we not have a chance to buy stocks materially cheaper?
2235 2018-05-20 22:33:01 Los griegos son grandes saqueadores. En efecto, toda la literatura griega está atravesada por esas grandes empresas, por esos raides que son raides de pillaje de los stocks agrícolas en el Cercano Oriente.

2236 2018-05-20 22:32:26 OK, Doc,  but don't you think there's a problem with the others, for example, a guy with 12 assault rifles with bump stocks at Mandalay Bay?
2237 2018-05-20 22:31:24 Ban bump stocks
2238 2018-05-20 22:30:58 Time for a change. Ban bum stocks.
2239 2018-05-20 22:30:11 Dude I've never actually been to @momsdemand but thanks for the tip. You keep saying I dont understand but I do & that's the problem. Simple question why is it so hard to think that raising the age or banning bump stocks for example are a bad thing?
2240 2018-05-20 22:28:51 You'd be put in stocks
2241 2018-05-20 22:28:30 Pongo stocks de Netflix Autopagable? A solo 0.50?
2242 2018-05-20 22:27:50 Texas does not have a red flag law so that would be a start.  A national database, better background checks, longer waiting periods, close the loopholes, ban bump stocks/high capacity mags.   AR-15's are banned in my state.  The way it should be everywhere.  No one misses them.
2243 2018-05-20 22:27:32 THEYLL PROBABLY HAVE STOCKS i mean bt21 originated from korea anyway skndjd
2244 2018-05-20 22:26:57 It’s very interesting how he continues to attack multiple US companies. I’m not sure why this doesn’t get more attention. They are US COMPANIES!  Why is he attacking them. He did it to Boeing and crashed their stocks...he does it with Amazon. Good god.
2245 2018-05-20 22:26:38 Agreed bump stocks should be banned. The ATF has challenged it.
2246 2018-05-20 22:25:35 Ok I tweeted about being interested in buying some stocks ONCE and now I keep getting flooded with commercials on my TV for e-trade. Y’all care to explain @FBI ?
2247 2018-05-20 22:24:35 But planned parenthood primarily provide on demand murderers of unborn children that is paid for by tax dollars. If planned parenthood was deserving of their tax money they would provide alternatives other than genocide. But this is off topic of slide fire stocks.
2248 2018-05-20 22:24:13 Dude why do you actually do some research on the laws and regulations already in place. Also bump stocks are stupid and most people don’t even use them, why you might ask? Because they are gay. An you don’t know anything about the AR-15 except that it looks like and M-4.
2249 2018-05-20 22:22:27 I didn’t vote for Trump because he’s a role model husband. His infidelities were well known for years. We have record unemployment, stocks are at all time highs, isis is all but extinct and we are on the cusp of peace on the Korean Peninsula.
2250 2018-05-20 22:21:41 It’s so sad that we’re still trying to ban bump stocks. I’m signing!!!
2251 2018-05-20 22:18:45 Ban bump stocks now!
2252 2018-05-20 22:16:09 As much as I LOVE the Stock Market $ES_F... I still prefer #Commodities > #Stocks. Specifically #Metals like #Gold $GC_F #Silver $SI_F & #Copper $HG_F. I also don't think #Oil $CL_F or RBOB #Gasoline $RB_F are done... Lastly, the #Grains: Soybeans $ZS_F Corn $ZC_F Wheat $ZW_F.
2253 2018-05-20 22:16:04 Aye man I can't let you go in on GOML like this. 

What they choose to do with their stocks is solely up to them as players.
2254 2018-05-20 22:14:40 my stocks are down *dabs*
2255 2018-05-20 22:14:29 Also why dont you tell me why gun regulations are a bad thing. Law abiding gun owners should have no issue with full background checks, waiting periods, training, licensing & limitations. You need bump stocks & AR-15s why? To hunt coyotes?
2256 2018-05-20 22:14:26 $twist on stocks exchange
2257 2018-05-20 22:14:17 Nope. Doesn't work like that. I've shot an AR15 w/ & w/o bump stocks and the difference is exponential.  No way you pull a trigger as fast as it recoils & reload automatically. Nope.
2258 2018-05-20 22:14:13 Stackin my money investin in stocks
2259 2018-05-20 22:13:47 Stop whining putz, remember your promise to ban bump stocks, didn’t think so -
2260 2018-05-20 22:13:40 You know I love everything you do so of course I was gunna love it :)
2261 2018-05-20 22:13:18 Please ban bump stocks
2262 2018-05-20 22:12:55 Also... I still like this one (spoken with confidence): $CSL share price is heading towards below $100, and that's where we will be looking to buy... (still looking?) #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
2263 2018-05-20 22:12:34 If I could go back in time, I’d stop colonization as a whole. Catch me dumping all of Columbus’s food stocks and immunizing indigenous people.
2264 2018-05-20 22:12:13 Please ban bump stocks!
2265 2018-05-20 22:11:53 Ban bump stocks.
2266 2018-05-20 22:11:32 Already spotted a new price target of $215 for $CSL... can somebody explain to me again why this stock is too expensive to own in one's investment portfolio? #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities

2270 2018-05-20 22:08:54 We need to do better. We need to step up for our kids & their future. Ban bump stocks!
2271 2018-05-20 22:08:21 Bump stocks mimic, but do not permanently convert, a gun into an automatic weapon. No human can pull a trigger fast enough to replicate a bump stock, silly girl. 

I took extensive firearm training. You sound ridiculous.
2272 2018-05-20 22:07:12 You have no problem with the POTUS stealing an election by working with the leader of a hostile foreign nation, selling our nation to every foreign entity he can for personal gain, trading stocks while in office (insider trading), lying about paying a porn star, etc etc. Next?
2273 2018-05-20 22:05:49 La lutte contre la piraterie comme la libération des esclaves n'etaient que des prétextes. La dette que la France ne voulait pas payer au Dey d'Alger et le pillage de ses stocks d'or furent les motivations de l'expedition d'Alger.

Un peu comme la Libye en 2011...
2274 2018-05-20 22:05:44 Ban bump stocks! Ban military grade weapons! Civilians/hunters do not need an AR-15!
2275 2018-05-20 22:05:22 Isn’t too hard if you can work stocks and shit. Definitely harder than having a job
2276 2018-05-20 22:04:42 Definitely BAN BUMP STOCKS
2277 2018-05-20 22:04:36 Seriously what the hell is with financial reporters like Bartiromo and Dobbs saying shit like this? What the hell does this have to do with stocks or finances?
2278 2018-05-20 22:04:24 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone on.
2279 2018-05-20 22:04:22 Plays right into “recent bias” article....works until doesn’t.  Dividend stocks? If you’re sleeping aren’t you concerned about principle? Lay off the weed
2280 2018-05-20 22:03:07 US stocks loving the US-China trade "wars" weekend news. $ES +0.8%, $NQ +0.9%.
2281 2018-05-20 22:03:03 As I make bread at least once a week, I get through a fair bit of yeast. My regular supermarket was out of the brand name it stocks & no other choices. Bought an own brand from another supermarket. Resulted in a significantly lighter textured loaf.
2282 2018-05-20 22:02:55 There's stakes on anther's ladder. There were stocks yesterday that I played fucking godly and shit on people, but then I couldn't close out game 3s. My mental stamina at hypertension was lacking and it showed so it's good to grind bo3s on anthers to stay godly all set
2283 2018-05-20 22:02:50 You were talking about knives, honey. I asked about a gun that reloads (semi automatic - AR-15). Bump stocks convert guns. I know my weapons ;)
2284 2018-05-20 22:02:36 PHEW! So glad you liked it! X
2285 2018-05-20 22:00:14 Klobuchar and Painter own mutual funds not individual stocks. That is how it should be but check out the site I posted.

2288 2018-05-20 21:58:56 Yeah, shorting probably one of the highest growth stocks after a supposed stock market breakout is a really tough thing to execute successfully even if you are right on the move.  Look at the drop NFLX had from 3/19 and the massive bull runs in the move.  It's tough to pull off
2289 2018-05-20 21:58:36 No one gives a rats butt about bump stocks. They probably were not used at Las Vegas. The rifles had bi pods can't use a bipod and a bump stock at the same time.

2292 2018-05-20 21:56:53 Do not ban bump stocks!!!!! Shall Not Be Infringed!!! Each and every rule, regulation and law chips away our freedom. Fell things are done by evil minds. The wielder of the tool holds the blame.
2293 2018-05-20 21:56:17 6) has easy access to guns and more guns and high-powered guns and powerful ammunition and bump stocks and large clips and the @NRA working night and day to make sure their access to killing tools is not impeded in the slightest by reason ...
2294 2018-05-20 21:55:37 I’m looking into investing my money into stocks or trades and I’m so confused on how this stuff works 
2295 2018-05-20 21:54:48 Well, compromise being the key, you want to raise the buying age to 21, I would want the voting age upped to 21 as well. Both constitutional rights with some restrictions. Bump stocks are banned but are easily made so kind of irrelevant and difficult to enforce.
2296 2018-05-20 21:52:32 Stocks just rose. Going to be hard to pass on a champion.
2297 2018-05-20 21:52:08 @tedlieu I hope and pray that special counsel has investigated Kelly Ann Conway's stocks and investments in Russian & other countries which shows her true motives. These people are committing treason in plane sight! Bribery, 500,000,000.00 for China jobs, ZTE 1st! U.S. 2nd!

2309 2018-05-20 21:41:53 Ban bump stocks. And thank you for your courage, Emma.
2310 2018-05-20 21:41:28 Just a reminder that Trump promised to federally ban bump stocks after the Parkland shooting. But he NEVER signed an executive order or law about it. Thanks for the empty promises @realDonaldTrump
2311 2018-05-20 21:41:26 .@realDonaldTrump I... no. We hereby demand that you stop acting like a fool and a whiney 5-year-old and start acting like our freaking president! You promised us months ago a ban on bump stocks. Where is it! Let me give you a promise. YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT!!! #WeHerebyDemand!
2312 2018-05-20 21:41:22 Just a reminder that Trump promised to federally ban bump stocks after the Parkland shooting. But he NEVER signed an executive order or law about it. Thanks for the empty promises @realDonaldTrump
2313 2018-05-20 21:41:02 Stocks and broths.
2314 2018-05-20 21:40:40 bump stocks don't turn semi autos into automatics.
2315 2018-05-20 21:40:09 The CDC hasn't been allowed to research guns, that was stopped 20 years ago. You're right that most are done by handguns, the issue is school shootings and mass shootings have often used AR-15's because they can adapt them with bump stocks and shoot dozens of shots per minute.

2320 2018-05-20 21:36:52 I'm going to be optimistic. Perhaps the CME gaps will only be 'back-filled' in a longer term bear market. Maybe in long-term bull markets, the gaps do not need to be back-filled? I would guess stocks don't need to be back-filled when they are in bull runs.
2321 2018-05-20 21:36:16 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW!
2322 2018-05-20 21:36:05 Bet The mucky book shop on Enfield St , stocks mushy peas porn ?

2324 2018-05-20 21:34:49 damn better buy into weed stocks now
2325 2018-05-20 21:31:44 "Speculate - to invest in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss". Cash flow or no cash flow, it's all speculation with no guarantees. And it all hinges on someone else wanting what you have more than you do.
2326 2018-05-20 21:30:47 I promise you, you wouldn't like it, because then that would mean we have to fight over the remaining stocks of tasty goodness!

2334 2018-05-20 21:25:32 Universal background check. Having a training and registration (just like drivers ed and having a drivers license). Additionally, banning bump stocks would be good too.

2347 2018-05-20 21:14:34 No. My financial advice is stop spending on Kylie lip kits and eating out everyday and save that money and buy blue chip stocks. Any money you’re not afraid to lose (ie what’d you spend on gaming, strippers, drinking) and buy crypto.
2348 2018-05-20 21:14:34 Instead of selling off "live" sheep lets build up our stocks for wool.

2351 2018-05-20 21:10:13 2/. Given the fact that the prices of stocks on the NYSE have long ago disconnected from and soared above the actual value of the companies they’re supposedly stock IN, this constant inflation of stock prices can’t go on forever.

2358 2018-05-20 21:04:25 Submitted a comment in favor of banning bump stocks. Everyone else should too.
2359 2018-05-20 21:04:17 Exactly. I doubt banning bump stocks will affect mass shootings much.
2360 2018-05-20 21:03:39 No, once I asked you why bump stocks were created, you had to back off because my point was valid. Guns are designed to kill and harm. #facts

2378 2018-05-20 20:49:02 Ban bump stocks. Education and registration. And the beginning of the amendment says well regulated. And the Supreme Court said that the right to guns is not unlimited. And that was Scalia.

2381 2018-05-20 20:46:45 Ban bump stocks along with assault rifles. Why do we even have to ask for it ? That's sad !
2382 2018-05-20 20:46:21 Gun control also includes reckoning w/ what kind of firearms are possible to buy legally in various states. 58 people died in Las Vegas this Oct in part because of legally purchased bump stocks that simulate automatic fire. There is no reason for citizens to have weapons of war.
2383 2018-05-20 20:46:16 Ban bump stocks. It’s a no brained.
2384 2018-05-20 20:46:14 Nothing on too many guns in society,nothing on assault rifles,nothing on magazine sizes,nothing on bump stocks,nothing on extra money for mental health issues,nothing on background checks,etc.... Vote these fools out,their killing our children !

2388 2018-05-20 20:43:47 I am not just advocating for the banning of bump stocks, I am arguing  for the implementation of gun laws like those those in Japan and Australia that have prevented or reduced the number of mass shootings like those in Las Vegas, Parkland, Sandy Hook, Columbine and so on.
2389 2018-05-20 20:43:15 All that is being suggested is universal background checks, make it illegal to seek bump stocks and assault rifles to civilians. They aren’t suggesting that people will have to turn in their hunting rifles etc
2390 2018-05-20 20:42:19 The majority of people want common sense gun laws. Ban bump stocks, universal background and maybe some mandatory training and education, like we have drivers ed and licenses for cars.
2391 2018-05-20 20:42:02 HAHAHA. Yes you do, just say it. Come on, why were bump stocks created in the first place? Just say it.
2392 2018-05-20 20:42:01 The term “Nasdaq” is also used to refer to the Nasdaq Composite, an index of more than 3,000 stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange that includes the world’s foremost technology and biotech giants such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, Intel and Amgen.

Not even sure they were used in Vegas.  Well, got to go get my AR ready for the range! Time to go shooting!

2424 2018-05-20 20:15:59 True, but how does banning bump stocks reduce mass shootings? There’s other things that would be more effective in reducing mass shootings seeing that bump stocks aren’t the reason for these tragedies.
2425 2018-05-20 20:13:16 Why stop at bump stocks? people will do shootings without them. In my opinion their needs to be a heavy restriction on the weapons that civilians have.

2457 2018-05-20 19:48:56 well, let me clarify that a bit: some assets, like fiat currency, are "backed" by certain promises made by centralized parties. or stocks can be backed by dividends. but otherwise, it's just supply & demand.
2458 2018-05-20 19:48:26 Ban bump stocks, they suck anyway. Licensing and training is fine, as I need one for a CCW anyway, but banning assault rifles and mags is where we differ.
2459 2018-05-20 19:46:14 The right 2 bear arms is not the right 2 be irresponsible with guns. It is not the right 2 compensate for low self-esteem by using military weapons. Gun control does not violate the 2nd Amendment, which was written long be4 Bump Stocks & automatic weapons. #OutdatedLaws

2464 2018-05-20 19:44:35 That's just it though. The gun reform side has been specific. The primary goals are universal background checks, training and licensing, and then a ban on assault style rifles and high capacity magazines and a ban on alteration materials like bump stocks.

2484 2018-05-20 19:29:04 Ban Bump stocks NOW.
2485 2018-05-20 19:28:31 Ughh no no no self please don’t do it  shet pero ang issues naga clear out na ged sila sang stocks so i need to avail one  pero shet ang sf
2486 2018-05-20 19:27:03 Ban bumps stocks!
2487 2018-05-20 19:23:03 Ban bump stocks!
2488 2018-05-20 19:21:49 We need to ban bump stocks.  No reason for them for any rational reason and they are such a danger when in the hands of someone intent on a mass killing.  #BanBumpStocks
2489 2018-05-20 19:21:09 @adhilshetty why the r no opportunities for USA NRI to invest in Indian stocks and MF? My plan was to get a mthly interest on 10L FD in NRE acc and SIP it in MF,is that good idea?
2490 2018-05-20 19:21:02 Bump stocks serve zero purpose for civilians. They serve to bring massive destruction to life - murder-  in a short period. In society , the targets are LIVING BEINGS. Ban bump stocks now!
2491 2018-05-20 19:21:01 naku batang yan... busy kasi ko kagabi di ko natext... di bale madami naman akong stocks ng vaporub.... hahahahahha
2492 2018-05-20 19:20:35 Ermm maybe something to do with giving longevity to fish stocks by drying them? And then we liked the taste so much we started doing it even when it wasn’t for excess fish   
2493 2018-05-20 19:20:10 The ATF deemed during Obama administration that banning bump stocks is unconstitutional even though Obama wanted it and the same thing is happening during the Trump administration. Only Congress can pass this and probably won't again.

2496 2018-05-20 19:18:46 Please ban bump stocks. Let's save lives.
2497 2018-05-20 19:18:22 Trump needs to just declassify and order the release of everything. It can't hurt the country more than what these so called law enforcement and intelligence agencies have done. Let the people see it all and decide. I'm shorting tar and feather stocks if that happens....
2498 2018-05-20 19:17:52 Ban bump stocks now
2499 2018-05-20 19:17:36 Bump stocks were banned until Obama forced Holder 2 give them an exemption! Obama and Holder should be held accountable
2500 2018-05-20 19:17:32 BY YOUR INACTION, GREED, AND SELFISHNESS YOU ARE SHOWING THAT YOU SUPPORT ASSAULT WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF TEENS AND MENTALLY UNSTABLE INDIVIDUALS. We don’t need AR-15s and AK-47s and bump stocks. You support death of children and innocent victims.  #NRAdoesnothing

2514 2018-05-20 19:13:07 Forget bump stocks we need to ban non child resistant bottles of Ritalin.

2524 2018-05-20 19:06:53 No that's also due to the fact that #Facebook has a higher percentage of bots then it first thought and they can't delete any more accounts or else their stocks will suffer more probably more then when #CambridgeAnalytica story first broke #DeleteFacebook
2525 2018-05-20 19:06:11 Have some weird jank that annoys me. Mario sometimes, bayo, dk and bowser (in a different way) basically rage. Luigi's jank can sometimes annoy me but its weirdly consistent with how it works and takes stocks quickly w/o rage. Kinda hypocritical ik but I think it's mostly rage
2526 2018-05-20 19:05:12 We look forward to having you here. Is @Tom_Stocks coming?
2527 2018-05-20 19:05:03 @AP #whitehouse @FBI the executive parties work to register the stocks bonds ect. Before they are registered. need paid to prevent slavery. use of the stock markets to pay them must be accepted. Work needs payment to do the work for deductions of supplies and support
2528 2018-05-20 19:04:31 Final Review before we go into the next trading week, hoping to not repeat any past mistakes and this might be the first time would attempt to short stocks instead of only going long. Applying patience in the process and only trading definite patterns would be given priority
2529 2018-05-20 19:04:27 One 30 round mag. At least after 10 the shooter will need to change mags. My point with bump stocks is why were they allowed to be created and sold in the first place? This is the kind of mentality that needs to change. I’m all for gun ownership AND common sense.
2530 2018-05-20 19:02:54 So states pass laws outlawing bump stocks but have no way to enforce it. Does nothing about the ones already out there. NY passed the SAFE act years ago and again has no way to enforce most of it. You'd have to be pretty unlucky to get caught or arrested for ignoring it.
2531 2018-05-20 19:01:28 Thinkin about getting some crocs but need a flow chart to know when to wear the crocs instead of the (birken)stocks

2533 2018-05-20 19:00:22 Ban bump stocks and other modifications that increase rate of fire

2535 2018-05-20 18:59:28 But the war mongers will find ways to profit off of blood and destruction. They know the stocks to by and sell. Watch the blood and money flow.... while the worms get richer.

2540 2018-05-20 18:56:54 Banning bump stocks is a small first step worth doing asap.
2541 2018-05-20 18:56:46 Facts...
BHO authorized sale of bump stocks in 2010

bump stock ban was in the omnibus in 2018

Who did what?
2542 2018-05-20 18:55:38 I think not. UK fishermen have been complaining for years about the effects of continental trawlers destroying fish stocks.
2543 2018-05-20 18:55:09 Dude. Didn’t you see the speech by their old CEO??? Literally said if you own a firearm don’t come in his stores. So I’m happy to oblige. (He got canned for that because their stocks plummeted )
2544 2018-05-20 18:54:48 Uh huh. And why shouldn’t bump stocks be banned? If they’re as useless as you claim, they don’t need to be available.

2548 2018-05-20 18:53:07 You’re too daft to understand the point here. Even if you did ban bump stocks it wouldn’t make a difference in the slightest. 
People like you will toil in your own virtue signaling crusades while nothing is done to the actual problem. But by all means.
2549 2018-05-20 18:52:58 I just submitted my comment, “Banning bump stocks is literally the least you can do”

2556 2018-05-20 18:50:23 Yeah...

By authorizing bump stocks be brought to market...
2557 2018-05-20 18:50:17 No  bump stocks!!!!
It makes so much sense.
2558 2018-05-20 18:49:44 2010 Bump Stocks became available to the public. Trump banned them. (I wasn't sure either.)
2559 2018-05-20 18:48:02 Ban Bump Stocks
2560 2018-05-20 18:46:57 A year of investing in stocks and shares and I’m up 27% #Easy
2561 2018-05-20 18:46:27 And why not ban bump stocks, raise the buying age to 21, and work on improving background checks? Again, I don’t want all the guns, I just think there is room for improvement on many fronts.
2562 2018-05-20 18:46:18 Ban bump stocks NOW!
2563 2018-05-20 18:45:47 But there is a better solution.  We could:
- Universal backgrounds
- Add select mental disorders to NICS & require all states use it
- Allow confiscation from perceived threats
- Require safes in homes
- Waiting periods
- Require safety training
- Ban bump stocks, binary triggers
2564 2018-05-20 18:45:39 And ban all the damn gadgets out there that can make a regular weapon do that. All over the internet for sale. Creeps me out. Much worse than bump stocks.

2568 2018-05-20 18:45:02 I supported the ban on bump stocks, as it was a device made to circumvent current law. I think that background checks should be done on all levels of gun sales. I believe guns should be withheld from anyone convicted of a violent crime.
2569 2018-05-20 18:44:40 2/2 to catering staff being available (it is provided for us by a third party company). The Coke will be the Conductors own, as we don't have stocks of catering on-board these trains, other than on the aforementioned catering trolley. ^AG
2570 2018-05-20 18:44:28 Protect the leaders of tomorrow today, ban bump stocks large capacity clips and automatic weapons.
2571 2018-05-20 18:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2572 2018-05-20 18:44:07 Let's not tell the gun nuts that. I just don't see an AR-15 ban happening soon, we can barely get bump stocks banned. Let's vote and see what we can do.
2573 2018-05-20 18:43:44 I’ll wager none of those smart devs thinks decentralized tokenization of stocks makes sense. @jimmysong @eric_lombrozo @LukeDashjr @adam3us @aantonop
2574 2018-05-20 18:43:43 WRONG.  YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET TRUMP WAS SWORN IN 1/20/17.  THOSE STOCKS WERE SOLD "BEFORE" JAN 20, 2017 & PUT INTO A TRUST.  YOUR LYING PROPAGANDA WILL NOT WORK, SOROS BOT. THIS IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.  IT NOT ONLY WAS ALL OVER THE NET, BUT, ON MSM AS WELL. NICE TRY, NO CIGAR.
2575 2018-05-20 18:43:35 Ban bump stocks .... They have no place in civilian hands
2576 2018-05-20 18:41:11 And I disagree with the @NRA on that.  Just like I disagree with the then held position on the Hughes amendment.

I think bump stocks are silly myself.  It doesn't take much training to bump fire a rifle from ones shoulder without one.

Being "sensitive" means ignoring the issue, and perpetuating it. What does being "sensitive" accomplish in your opinion Brian Stocks?
2582 2018-05-20 18:38:22 I agree about bump stocks, background checks, and age 21.  Not sure what you mean about driver licenses.  My state issues those at age 16.  Regarding assault weapons, I am undecided.
2583 2018-05-20 18:38:08 We all would like to believe that BTC long term trajectory will continue up, and a good hedge. My question is, we are overdue for a recession, stocks seem to be topping out, and easy money is drying up. Trade war looms. How will Crypto respond to a recession or financial crises ?
2584 2018-05-20 18:38:04 Nope. Mine runs out in November.

2588 2018-05-20 18:36:53 We accept that there are limits on free speech, when it endangers the public, yelling fire to cause a panic. So why are we so unwilling to accept the same on the second? It's time to close gunshow loop holes and ban assult rifles & bump stocks.

2589 2018-05-20 18:36:30 in my world evry upstart ceo would be required to invest signifct private funds into vested stock, would get vested stocks as comp and would only be able to sell-off that stake after signifct time after leaving company -> incentive for selection of appropriate successor

2594 2018-05-20 18:33:27 A bill was created to ban bump stocks on March 1st. 
 You say "anything that mimics an automatic weapon" please be more specific. 
What is more deadly, 1 30 round magazine or 5 - 10 round magazines ?????
2595 2018-05-20 18:33:25 If you think banning bump stocks is your  'ANSWER' to your problem just shows you know absolutely NOTHING about GUNS. When 'TRUE SOLUTIONS' are so important you must first UNDERSTAND the REAL PROBLEM!
2596 2018-05-20 18:32:59 Universal background checks, waiting periods, limits on ammunition, banning of things like bump stocks, liability for parents who don’t keep guns locked up in the home when children are present. Should I continue?
2597 2018-05-20 18:32:48 2 stocks and Smash 4 is already in top 8. The other streams are literally open and it's not even 3 PM.
2598 2018-05-20 18:32:08 Stop trying to change the narrative @realDonaldTrump if you really intended to do something about gun violence sign the executive order to ban bump stocks like you promised two months ago
2599 2018-05-20 18:31:55 They like to tease a bump stock ban because they think liberals don't know about guns and think bump stocks are important. They're not totally wrong btw. They can't tease it if they actually do it.
2600 2018-05-20 18:30:44 Lol. You people crack me up.  So tell me, genius,after sandy hook and gabby giffords - when Obama had the house and 60 votes in the senate he and Dems did nothing.They could have banned assault style weapons or bump stocks or expanded background checks or anything else.  Why not?

2603 2018-05-20 18:30:16 Raise your hand if you are responsible for keeping a prescription for Ritalin or another ADHD med filled (for yourself or someone else) and think guns, bump stocks, and ammo should at least be as regulated as this medication. 
2604 2018-05-20 18:30:08 This is ridiculous. Because of the other garbage smash game taking 5 minutes to take 3 stocks a game?
2605 2018-05-20 18:29:56 And like on every other market 95% of people loose money, nothing special in crypto, moves like Penny stocks, the only difference is unregulation.
2606 2018-05-20 18:28:52 For example....
Why aren’t bump stocks illegal? Makes no sense. Anything that mimics an automatic weapon should be illegal. 7+ months after Vegas and nothing...dumb.
Why does JQPublic need a 30 round mag?????
2607 2018-05-20 18:27:59 Depends on how many lives you want to save. You could ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, AR-15s altogether, other ARs, gunshow loopholes, etc. And yes, enforce them. I think each one saves more lives.

We agree on mental health screening and increasing services.
2608 2018-05-20 18:27:13 ban bump stocks
2609 2018-05-20 18:25:53 They are likely going to branch into stable-coin securities next, so people in India (for instance) can have investment exposure to Apple or Alphabet stocks. tZERO is going the same route. I am invested in both. It's a brilliant way to use crypto.

2614 2018-05-20 18:23:44 Fair enough, shorting bank stocks is very risky business. Eisman being a stats and numbers guy, I’m wondering why he seems so sure the housing market still has a ways down to go. Do you have any idea what stats might be driving his opinion in particular?
2615 2018-05-20 18:23:03 Bwahahaha! The central bankers are communists and so are stocks, bonds, cd’s and derivative holdings. You’re literally insane. Go back to high school child. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
2616 2018-05-20 18:22:13 Yeah, just collecting and reviewing #stocks #data
No way out! #Music to #enjoy must accompany me!
2617 2018-05-20 18:22:13 Enough Said! Good eye #investing #breakouts #stocks @MarketSmith  RT @johnpeltier: Man. @MarketSmith makes it easy to see missed opportunities.  $TWLO wasn't on my radar at ALL in early Feb while the market was tanking. WOW.  Up 67% in 64 days post breakout.
2618 2018-05-20 18:21:35 I feel a business disruption a comin’.  Santa Fe promoted this level of murder as acceptable as long as you don’t dicker with the 2nd Amend. Start Grievance Committees (GC) to go to killing grounds and bring solace. Get Ins. for GC. Charge school a fee. Sell stocks. BINGO
2619 2018-05-20 18:21:19 2) This cld have been stopped, not by banning bump stocks & “military style weapons”, not by limiting magazines or stronger background checks. This could have been stopped by making it as hard to take guns on campus, to use a gun on campus, as hard as it is or as unattractive..
2620 2018-05-20 18:19:10 Actually, you're wrong, Bonnie Breeze.  Bump stocks aren't banned nationwide nor do we have universal background checks.
2621 2018-05-20 18:18:48 @realDonaldTrump You promised to ban “bump stocks” in response to exploding  gun violence under your administration.   So where’s the Executive Order, legislation or proposed regulation many months later?  Broken promise.
2622 2018-05-20 18:17:39 Which is why people only use bump stocks to fire into crowds. If you think, “the more lead flying, the less lethal, you don’t know the first thing about anything.
2623 2018-05-20 18:17:21 Ban bump stocks and all automatic weapons!
2624 2018-05-20 18:17:03 Does @Stash allow value investment for stocks?
2625 2018-05-20 18:16:33 You like your stock certificates to be safe at Merril Lynch - I like my stocks on my Trezor
2626 2018-05-20 18:16:01 It's worse stocks bonds cars realestate the dollar are all in bubbles.
2627 2018-05-20 18:15:50 I just want stocks and bonds for graduation. The gift that keeps on giving.
2628 2018-05-20 18:15:25 Not every mass shooting will be the same. But let’s work on the banning of bump stocks, closing gun show loop holes, maybe have a gun registry in this country?
2629 2018-05-20 18:15:11 1) read the study 2) if criminals don't follow laws, why have any at all? Heck pretty much everyone disobeys speeding limits, so let's get rid of them. Think the number of accidents won't go up? 3) bump stocks were not illegal
2630 2018-05-20 18:13:48 Stocks Wobble but Post Weekly Gains

U.S. stocks slipped Friday but notched weekly gains, buoyed by rallying energy shares and signs that a trade spat among the world's top economies was

2633 2018-05-20 18:12:21 No reason for civilians to own assault weapons, high capacity mags or bump stocks. Respect life and restore youth confidence.
2634 2018-05-20 18:11:48 BAN BUMP STOCKS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!
2635 2018-05-20 18:11:08 Stocks are a ponzi scheme lel.
Honestly probably bc of Bezos bad press lately, churning it a bit.
2636 2018-05-20 18:09:54 For me, any 'gun reform' that doesn't include mental health and bullying measures is a non starter.  But, I'm all for a real conversation. In my opinion, there is no need for bump stocks for example.
2637 2018-05-20 18:09:53 Bump stocks and full auto should be perfectly legal to own if you pass a background check. Banning them will not stop people with bad intentions from obtaining them
2638 2018-05-20 18:08:28 I personally wouldn't rush to short bank stocks.
2639 2018-05-20 18:07:59 Let’s ban bump stocks!

2648 2018-05-20 18:03:42 1) trump has over 17 accusers more accusers
2) more then 3/4 of the fortune 500 companies that received the tax cut are not reinvesting in employees, rather, using it to buy back their own stocks.
3) Tax cuts have nothing to do with wage increases.
2649 2018-05-20 18:02:40 Get rid of bump stocks now
2650 2018-05-20 18:01:30 i really want to start getting into stocks
2651 2018-05-20 18:00:42 Yes Lou, just how much  you pocket away every time you run such glowing, lying stories on the bloated evil one?Hmm would be interesting to see how your stocks and bank accounts have grown since the advent of Trump. Let US know, will you.
2652 2018-05-20 17:59:24 The way it's falling looks will become single digit soon, no hope for recovery,
2653 2018-05-20 17:58:54 Maybe people better check where the politicians have their money invested.  They probably have thousands of dollars invested in NRA and/or gun stocks to make money on the more guns being sold.
2654 2018-05-20 17:57:21 Hello Guys, Weekly newsletter is released in the app. Please check. Also 2 stocks which I didn't mention due to space problem is Jk tyre and Ucafuel. Please grab these two for 3months also. Buy minimum two stocks from any group.

2662 2018-05-20 17:54:14 Kid's lives are more important than bump stocks. 

If full-Auto is rightfully and legally banned, anything that makes a gun Perform in a nearly identical manner should be banned as well.

2664 2018-05-20 17:52:48 They make money off controversy.
The media is just responsible for inspiring mass shootings as access to guns, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, poor mental health services, and every other scapegoat people use to justify this pandemic.
They give them what they want.
2665 2018-05-20 17:52:18 I would always do as my 14 year old daughter demanded!! Good lord why do people care what Europe thinks. We have record stocks, record low unemployment, low taxes unlike Europe. And BTW record low black unemployment. Not bad for a white supremest nation.
2666 2018-05-20 17:50:55 While I agree that there is no need for bump stocks, what is banning them actually going to accomplish? Vegas is the only mass shooting that they’ve been used at.
2667 2018-05-20 17:50:20 •Enforcing law vs. criminals who try to buy guns illegally
•Prohibiting bump stocks
•Prohibiting sale of high-capacity magazines & assault weapons
•Preventing deregulation of gun silencers
•Promoting responsible gun storage /ownership
•Closing terror gap loophole <End
2668 2018-05-20 17:49:56 Political science expert when the establishment campaigns for an average Joe or Sue that actually represents a nation instead of the million dollar/ billion dollar club scholars & others may actually believe they want to help their country other than that its all about stocks
2669 2018-05-20 17:49:13 Tell you what. We’ll get rid of bump stocks and you stop allowing abortions after 5 weeks. At least it’s a start.

2671 2018-05-20 17:48:42 I'm talking about separating the shotguns and the revolvers from banning the AR-15s and such, including bump stocks. I thought that was clear.
2672 2018-05-20 17:48:25 I will hold for these targets, should I keep adding on dips? For these two stocks? Last question any top 5 stocks you advice I should invest for long term target.. Thanks a lot for your suggestion and time!
2673 2018-05-20 17:48:17 Natuurlijk hebben vuurwapens ermee te maken, maar voor zover er Amerikaanse steun is voor strengere wetten, betwijfel ik of ze revolvers en handmatige hagelgeweren willen verbannen zoals deze dader gebruikte. Het is een wonder dat bump stocks aangepakt worden imho.
2674 2018-05-20 17:47:16 @davidhogg111        Ban bump stocks immediately and vote out all those who hinder this process      #BanBumpStocks

2681 2018-05-20 17:45:57 Ban bump stocks.
2682 2018-05-20 17:45:39 Bump stocks are people killers , not for hunting , not for normal gun use . Assult weapons are people killers and nothing else.
2683 2018-05-20 17:45:21 Yes Ban Bump stocks
2684 2018-05-20 17:45:01 Ban bun stocks
2685 2018-05-20 17:44:50 The Las Vegas was a bump stocks, which pretty much everyone agrees should be illegal. The Pulse night club shooter did not shoot 24 rounds in 9 seconds, as the weapons were automatic. A pistol can shoot equally as fast as an AR 15. The real difference is the ergonomics of the gun
2686 2018-05-20 17:44:12 ....And off his friends bottom line. That’s another example of graft and corruption in his administration. President Obama didn’t have any stocks in coal mines or oil companies. He did the right thing and divested when he took office. Donny continues to prosper off us.
2687 2018-05-20 17:44:06 As with oother industries, automotive, hi-tech, the big supermarkets rely on JIT deliveries so they dint hoard expensive or perishable goods expensively. Stocks leave warehouses as quickly as they arrive, so stocks are shortline. Hence rationing is not so unlikely on a bad Brexit
2688 2018-05-20 17:44:02 Ban bump stocks. Do something
2689 2018-05-20 17:43:51 Ban bump stocks..
2690 2018-05-20 17:43:25 He and Buffett didn’t believe In internet stocks or apple way back when either. Now heavily invested.
2691 2018-05-20 17:42:58 That is why it is so important to enter the discussion.  To me common sense means ban on bump stocks and assault weapons.  Background checks, and  change of age to 21.  We do it for alcohol, and drivers'  licenses.  Why not guns?
2692 2018-05-20 17:42:20 HAHAHAHA NAGUGUTOM NA KO TAS NAALALA KO NAGHAKOT NGA PALA AKO NG STOCKS KANINA KAYA DI KO NA KAILANGAN BUMABA
2693 2018-05-20 17:40:41 Save up and invest in active assets like mutual funds or stocks, you’re young so you can go for risky options (more risk= more return)so youcan smooth out your consumption for the rest of your life. Pakistan has the lowest savings in the world, you need to save to save the future

2702 2018-05-20 17:36:13 Definitely ban bump stocks. As a shooter, I can say they don't improve your accuracy, and only let you spray more bullets in a general direction.
2703 2018-05-20 17:34:14 Tokenization of real world assets like stocks, real estate, gold requires trusted custodians, curators of the assets.  Therefore you may as well trust them to run the ledger.

2712 2018-05-20 17:29:00 Ban Bump Stocks
2713 2018-05-20 17:28:34 Ban bump stocks and automatic weapons. Raise the buying age for guns. The founding fathers couldn’t even imagine these types of weapons - this was never the intention of the 2nd amendment. Let’s protect our citizens, our children, our country. #resist
2714 2018-05-20 17:28:06 Ban Bump Stocks and ALL assault weapons, or assault style and magazines.
2715 2018-05-20 17:27:38 Your shows should not suck that bad, when you have one of the most loaded rosters outside of NJPW. Its embarrassing as fuck, but WWE got their stocks and tv deals... so they don't give a fuck.

2718 2018-05-20 17:27:23 A nice big class action lawsuit for dscrimnation against Conservatives and violation of our 1st Amendment rights will censor their dumb ass bank accounts too. And who cares if it brings Twitter stocks tumbling.

2732 2018-05-20 17:19:40 I live in Texas. I’m from CA. And let me tell you something honey, these Texans ain’t shit. The ones you speak of are ignorant and uneducated. Laughing stocks and regarded as rednecks in this part of town. And yes, arguing with them is useless. They can barely articulate a thing
2733 2018-05-20 17:19:28 Ban bump stocks, ban military style weapons,  ban NRA money in elections.
2734 2018-05-20 17:18:52 He was the main guy. That’s just a fact. He thought they were fine and went all over the tv. In fact I think even a day before they crashed he said they were good stocks to buy

2754 2018-05-20 17:07:29 “Protecting the border” = separating families that are trying to come across to avoid persecution?
“Growing the economy” = have you seen gas prices? And stocks? And the soy embargo? And the deficit? Wrong economy, buddy.
“Cutting taxes” = was for the 1%, yours expire in 2 years.
2755 2018-05-20 17:07:06 According to me even I have been victimized of this even few f my relations got ruined according to me I believe I earn a lot from stocks n shares by grace f God but d most valuable commodity in dis world one should respect it's TIME respect someone's time , I agree @AlexisFawx

2758 2018-05-20 17:06:37 Ban bump stocks. They serve no purpose in a civilized society.
2759 2018-05-20 17:06:37 I hear ppl talk about bump stocks. An owner of an ar-15 told me bump stocks were junk. Harder to hit your target. Ppl committing mass murder aren't worried about shooting accuracy. If bump stocks are junk, get rid of them! Common sense
2760 2018-05-20 17:06:06 All Media Talking points.. What is the gun show loop hole? Statistics show that hi Cap mag bans do nothing to slow gun violence. Bump Stocks, banned (and won’t change gun violence stats). Ban Military style Weapons (banned since the 80’s). Oh you mean semi auto rifles...
2761 2018-05-20 17:06:02 I believe stocks will still exist in the sense that shares of companies will still trade publically, and eventually people will be able to custody their own keys. WE used to do that with paper stock certificates. There are many pluses.
2762 2018-05-20 17:04:39 Ban bump stocks and all weapons of war to the general public!and yes 1 bad apple spoils the bunch!  If everyone can’t play nice with the toys then the toys get taken away from everyone, it’s elementary lessons revisited for those who didn’t learn the1st time
2763 2018-05-20 17:04:24 $SPY Some would leave you to believe that the market went nowhere the last 4 days. Truth is many stocks exploded! Careful what you believe.
2764 2018-05-20 17:02:32 I’ll make a new cartoon for that - something about thinking that either stocks won’t exist anymore or that they won’t use this tech
2765 2018-05-20 17:01:47 Ban bump stocks. Enough.
2766 2018-05-20 17:01:13 Voluntary bgc's won't be too much of an issue: develop a website that you can get a code from using NICS. Good for 72 hours. Verified by phone/internet.

Regulating bump stocks just requires legislation. Grandfather existing ones, get transfer stamps from the ATF /1
2767 2018-05-20 17:01:05 @sainidivish Hi Divish, what is you’re take on L&T and Cyient stocks?
2768 2018-05-20 17:00:20 Ban bump stocks
2769 2018-05-20 16:59:59 Eventually he will swap with tokenized securities (Stocks)
2770 2018-05-20 16:59:11 This time next month both stocks will be double. I anticipate news on DD for SX completed this month. Next month financing. IDK financials this month, next month SX, FDM, GRAT, APP, IP one will run hard so will IDK. Also  IPO for gold play in next 60 days. #patienceiskey
2771 2018-05-20 16:57:39 Taking large capacity magazines off the market, removal of bump stocks (which I believe is happening but still)
2772 2018-05-20 16:57:33 @profgalloway- Thoughts on @RobinhoodApp as possible fifth (dark)horseman? Stocks/crypto platform -> online bank -> digital source of record for personal finance. It's nascent but pieces of the T algorithm are in place.....
2773 2018-05-20 16:55:36 The more housepoints for stocks, the better!
2774 2018-05-20 16:55:12 Time to buy option stocks for Starbucks?
2775 2018-05-20 16:54:22 Banning Bump stocks should be a no brained the same with banning semi automatic guns from civilians. Please stop telling these young people that they are trying to upend the second amendment. They aren’t. They are using intelligence and logic to try and stem more mass shootings.
2776 2018-05-20 16:54:19 I've done my research. It is a fact the nra uses millions of dollars to lobby against any restriction on guns including background checks waiting periods, eliminating him stocks and has Trump repeal Obama legislation limiting guns to mentally ill.  These are FACTS. U do research.
2777 2018-05-20 16:54:17 Ban bump stocks!
2778 2018-05-20 16:54:16 Obama also approved of bump stocks yet blames the NRA. It's like they avoid blame by finding a scapegoat every time.
2779 2018-05-20 16:54:09 Ban bump stocks andmake that just the beginning of the end of weapons of mass murder.
2780 2018-05-20 16:53:58 banning bump stocks won't do anything. lol. You can use a belt as a substitute.
2781 2018-05-20 16:53:39 Banning bump stocks is a start!
2782 2018-05-20 16:53:38 And ‘Utility Tokens’? Sure the central company behind it can be shut down - doesn’t make utility tokens worse than how currency legacy shares are done. Agree that blockchain is a slow database with limited use - sound money and new funding/stocks and shares system makes sense tho
2783 2018-05-20 16:52:38 3) I'd like to see a ban on military (used in COMBAT in war) guns. NO ONE needs them except police officers & our military. A ban on bump stocks as well. I could go as far as to say these types of guns could be housed at shooting ranges if people get a thrill of shooting them.
2784 2018-05-20 16:52:29 Laws banning bump stocks/guns wouldn't instantly fix the problem, obviously. Black markets will likely emerge. But when access is limited & possession is punished, shootings decrease -- visible in many other countries that implemented similar laws after their first mass shooting.
2785 2018-05-20 16:52:29 He literally gave stocks away coulda end the set way earlier
2786 2018-05-20 16:50:38 There’s no valid moral reason for bump stocks to even exist, let alone be legal.
2787 2018-05-20 16:50:28 This is a no-brainer...ban bump stocks!
2788 2018-05-20 16:49:59 Ban bump stocks to civilians. #Enforce2A #ReinstateMilitias Also make a requirement for States to report when someone is a felon/has a drug possession convictions/convicted of domestic abuse/institutionalised by court order #ComprehensiveBackgroundChecks #RequireStatesReport2List
2789 2018-05-20 16:49:05 It's not up to him where the pension fund of someone he used to work for gets invested. You asserted that he personally had stocks and shares, which he doesn't.
2790 2018-05-20 16:48:11 And you should invest in ZTE stocks as well. I have got 500 Million reasons why
2791 2018-05-20 16:47:11 If you invest in stocks have a separate account for delivery investment and Intraday investment. It is easy to monitor this way and also makes tax calculation easy.
2792 2018-05-20 16:46:31 80% of gun owners are in favor of some regulations to keep us more safe (eg universal background checks, no bump stocks, limited magazines) yet #nra & @GOP want to do nothing
2793 2018-05-20 16:46:21 #GunControlNow God wants you to ban assault rifles, bump stocks and get universal background checks. Listen to him.
2794 2018-05-20 16:45:52 While the MSM is involved I believe the LV terrorist shooter made bump stocks famous. Before then I nevr heard of or had known about bump stocks. the media does play a role, It was big news. But Where to draw the line before it becomes “sensationalized”? #BanBumpStocks

2796 2018-05-20 16:45:36 Safe storage, red flag laws, universal background checks, banning of bump stocks keep your 2nd amendment and lives safe, Dan Patrick. Why not fight for common sense gun laws?
2797 2018-05-20 16:45:31 Ban bump stocks now!!
2798 2018-05-20 16:45:20 Why stop at Bump stocks... no one needs an assault rifle. Making ammunition very expensive doesn’t violate the 2nd
2799 2018-05-20 16:44:37 Hey Twitter fam quick question. Who buys stocks? Looking into buying stocks & can use some tips.  Thanks!
2800 2018-05-20 16:43:36 Banning bump stocks is barely a start to the war on guns
2801 2018-05-20 16:43:15 There is no conceivable reason that bump stocks should be available for sale to the public, or at all.
2802 2018-05-20 16:43:12 Ban bump stocks!
2803 2018-05-20 16:43:00 I’m just gonna say this once, and I should pin this tweet... You will NEVER have a career in stocks being a “Chaser.” You May have minature success here and there. Win now and then, but chasing stocks thru emotion = means to and end. Dead end road.

2805 2018-05-20 16:42:47 There's a lot of pump on oil stocks and half of it I read an think that's crazy. I've been taking a further position in SRSP at 25% below The Placing price. Ain't got to wait any longer than the others! And this is a magical discount in the current climate

2807 2018-05-20 16:42:13 Are you trying to ban bump stocks or just bump stocks? There's a free comment. You and I both know this will not have any effect. You're just another whore now.
2808 2018-05-20 16:42:07 It’s a no brainer....ban bump stocks
2809 2018-05-20 16:41:41 BAN BUM STOCKS
2810 2018-05-20 16:40:52 Bump stocks aren’t protected by the Constitution.
2811 2018-05-20 16:40:10 va vrmt falloir que je pense à ramener d stocks de mouchoir dans ma chambre
2812 2018-05-20 16:39:53 Gun Control debate, is mostly smoke & mirrors. HOGG, meet DICK!
The Dick Act of 1902, negates all real gun control, of guns themselves.
WHO cares about Bump Stocks? No one who knows guns.
Gun Control & fear of losing 2A, is pretty good for the businesses who're selling guns.
2813 2018-05-20 16:39:23 Hi Krunal. The Fosse Park store stocks this item but there is very limited stock at the moment. I recommend giving them a call on 0116 263 1153 before you head out to confirm stock levels. Gordo
2814 2018-05-20 16:39:22 Tone never said you can’t make money with Shitcoins. He said Shitcoins are like penny stocks, all hype with no product yet. Tones view on Crypto profits are long term and risk adjusted. @ToneVays

2816 2018-05-20 16:39:12 Ban Bumb Stocks #GunReformNow 
2817 2018-05-20 16:38:58 Ban bump stocks NOW.
2818 2018-05-20 16:38:41 Oh, Kaitlin, that's cute; however bump stocks aren't mentioned in the Constitution. 2A is a right to bear arms and a well regulated militia. The latter would allude to the modern day National Guard. If you feel the need to serve, I suggest you join it, or go active duty.
2819 2018-05-20 16:38:01 close the gun show and online loopholes, ban High velocity military-style assault weapons and bump stocks, and require background checks on anyone seeking to purchase a gun. Keeping Guns from High Risk Individuals seems like a good start. All the "Good" guys can keep their guns.
2820 2018-05-20 16:37:54 Ban bump stocks.  It's not a toy! It's a killing accessory!
2821 2018-05-20 16:37:54 Ban Bump Stocks!!! And why not? One ‘good’ reason! (and I don’t want a word about our founding fathers wanting you to have them, please)
2822 2018-05-20 16:37:22 Demain, je ne sais pas si je travaille ou pas. Si je commence plus tard ou finis plus tôt. Personne ne m’a rien dit. Je sais juste qu’il n’y aura aucune livraison. On aura juste les stocks et on va clairement pas mettre 4h à placer les stocks.
2823 2018-05-20 16:36:44 Stop bump stocks now
2824 2018-05-20 16:36:02 What an imbecile!!??!!?!?  GUNS are the problem!  Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines & hold parents accountable if their minor children use their weapons to harm or kill!!!!
2825 2018-05-20 16:35:44 Bump stocks serve no purpose other than killing people faster and getting around being a fully automatic weapon. The comments herein about God Given Rights are insane.
2826 2018-05-20 16:35:42 Ban bump stocks!
2827 2018-05-20 16:35:10 It's time to stop bump stocks.
2828 2018-05-20 16:35:04 Ban bump stocks, save our future. STOP the excuses, no one needs to spray bullets like a fire hose sprays water.
2829 2018-05-20 16:33:42 But bump stocks are legal, basically turning firearms into automatic weapons....for what purpose?
2830 2018-05-20 16:32:14 Tim Are you tied to big oil. Have stocks work for them?? This country needs to move forward. The Republicans have been in office way too long. And this country has fallen way behind. High speed rail. In LA Musk building tunnels underground. We have to Something.
2831 2018-05-20 16:32:05 FL- bans bump stock, raises the minimum age limit to buy firearms to 21, 3 day min wait period
OR- bans ownership for domestic violence offenders
IL- raises min age to own assault weapons
RI-  remove firearms from those who pose a threat 
VT- ban bump stocks, raises age limit
2832 2018-05-20 16:32:00 Based on Mr @sptulsian CNBC recommendation, I purchased Dwarikesh Sugar pre 2008, when I started in stocks and ended up loosing 90% of my capital in 4-5 years when I finally sold.
2833 2018-05-20 16:31:27 Why LOL? You'd be surprised at how many financially savvy friends ask me if it's time to sell every time stocks drop 10% in one week (usually at the very bottom).
2834 2018-05-20 16:30:54 I’ll admit that I would never surrender the 2A. Guns are a tool. Hunting, defense, etc. But there’s a reasonable compromise. Bump stocks have to go. Rapid-fire is unreasonable. But I plan on owning several handguns and a rifle or two. When handled safely, they are useful and fun.
2835 2018-05-20 16:30:41 BAN BUMP STOCKS
2836 2018-05-20 16:30:24 Ban Bump Stocks.
2837 2018-05-20 16:30:19 Bump stocks serve no other purpose than to kill humans at a quicker rate. Killing a deer takes one bullet. I know of zero hunters that spray their animals with bullets. Kinda ruins the meat. Ban the bump stock now
2838 2018-05-20 16:29:48 Ban bump stocks!
2839 2018-05-20 16:29:36 Ban bump stocks #GunReformNow #thekidswillwin
2840 2018-05-20 16:29:18 What do bump-stocks have to do with anything. It’s like trying to ban orange sights or metal triggers. You can still shoot the damn gun. Seems like a minor cause made to look like a big deal
2841 2018-05-20 16:28:26 Honestly with the Vegas shooting, nothing can be done except for a ban on assault style weapons. Because people can make bump stocks somewhat easily, so I find that ban ineffective. Can't believe we still know next to nothing about that shooter still.
2842 2018-05-20 16:27:55 Bump stocks have no place in civilized society. Ban them now!
2843 2018-05-20 16:27:27 who stocks or deliveries your gin would love to try at our restaurant home in leeds

In SAFETY MARGINS we trust

In TURN AROUNDS, FUTUROLOGY, LOVE STOCKS, SHORT-CUTS I do not trust
2846 2018-05-20 16:24:33 Ans: Because those that manufacture and sell the guns and bullets buys most the stocks and bonds with their profits. That's life on planet earth.
2847 2018-05-20 16:24:12 It takes two minutes and your comments can be short I used 
“I am against Bump Stocks or any device that allows civililians to fire a weapon at or near automatic weapon speeds. These devices pose a great proven threat to law enforcement and the general population”
2848 2018-05-20 16:23:43 Agree. My question is not what CONAB or the USDA is saying, more so what is the market pricing? Judging by the way the market responded to global ending stocks reported 23mmt lower than expected, I would say the story is supportive for corn, but not necessarily bullish.
2849 2018-05-20 16:23:32 What did i spend my money on last night?

an $8 glass of wine, a doughboy, and $50 in stocks...
2850 2018-05-20 16:23:13 We would only hope. Was beginning to think these gold stocks would benefit my grandchildren and there not even born yet!

2855 2018-05-20 16:19:51 Do you know why it's easier to buy guns and bullets than it is to buy stocks and bonds?
2856 2018-05-20 16:19:45 Ban bump stocks.
2857 2018-05-20 16:19:10 *Indostar allottees*

2858 2018-05-20 16:17:17 Y’all so weird. People pay millions for art all the time. It’s like buying stocks or bonds. Majority of art increases in value with age so Diddy just made an investment like any of millionaire.

2865 2018-05-20 16:12:16 Agree. Was dumbfounded when I learned the rules in place - can't be right, this (and even less so when stocks remain low).
2866 2018-05-20 16:09:04 Any progress is great, but bump stocks are really a distraction---they're worthless without a high-capacity magazine. I fear that banning bump stocks gives politicians a way to say they've done something, when they have really done the barest minimum.

2873 2018-05-20 16:07:38 Bump stocks should be banned.
2874 2018-05-20 16:07:19 No one wants to rescind the 2nd Amendment.  This is a tired argument.  People want universal background checks,age limit on purchases, no assault rifles, no bump stocks.  Keep your shotguns, pistols & hunting rifles, but store them securely.  This does not infringe 2nd Amendment.
2875 2018-05-20 16:07:06 Diky za tip :)
2876 2018-05-20 16:06:52 "We can <BAN> bump stocks" you left out ban David
2877 2018-05-20 16:06:47 No bump stocks are used most of the time. This last shooting was with a hand gun and single fire rifle. So now what?
2878 2018-05-20 16:06:36 Ban bump stocks.
2879 2018-05-20 16:06:34 It should have already been passed BAN BUMP STOCKS!
2880 2018-05-20 16:06:23 Bump stocks are not needed for protection, they need to be banned!
2881 2018-05-20 16:06:16 Ban bump stocks, assault weapons & high capacity magazines!!!!
2882 2018-05-20 16:05:53 1) What's an assault weapon?
2) What's this fixation on bump stocks?  I can do the same thing with a belt loop.
3) ARGH.  
4) Need states to comply with NICS and put the data in there, oh yeah need the feds to do the same.  Waiting periods don't do anything.

2889 2018-05-20 16:04:48 Bump stocks? It’s just a technique. They’re outlawing them (just feel good legislation, won’t do anything) We outlaw a lot of things, someone how criminals don’t tend to care about our laws. They’re weird that way.

2899 2018-05-20 16:00:45 I'm an immigrant and don't see where #Trump exaggerated any danger. He is enforcing immigration laws that are already in place. #NRA has nothing to do w immigration. I and many other gun owners think NRA compromise too easily on certain gun rights, bump stocks being 1 example.

2901 2018-05-20 16:00:34 Banning bump stocks is a no brainer. For those of us who want to live in a safe society.

2906 2018-05-20 15:58:53 Shame you aren't allowed to put him in stocks so we can throw rotting food at him.
2907 2018-05-20 15:58:48 While I see why Gold, I also think there is a handful of fundamentally sound stocks that you could have bought to diversify your risk and have a solid portfolio. Also starting a fund and accepting participation from Egyptian people instead of all this cash Egyptians put in banks
2908 2018-05-20 15:58:37 Why can’t we do both? Ban assault rifles, bump stocks AND put in the metal detectors and add some security guards. Yes people will still kill people, but let’s try to make it a little harder for them.

2915 2018-05-20 15:52:29 Ban bump stocks!! Ban bump stocks!! Ban bump stocks!!
2916 2018-05-20 15:51:30 I'm going to buy stocks, ETFs, and some REITs, because at that price level I'm gonna seriously need to rebalance my portfolio.
2917 2018-05-20 15:51:28 What stocks should I invest in?
2918 2018-05-20 15:50:23 and your portfolio behaving as if your guesses on stocks your picked are coming to an end :) @porinju just imagine what will happen when people starts withdrawing funds from where you invested :)
2919 2018-05-20 15:49:25 The only reason bump stocks matter to any law-abiding gun owner is that it sets a dangerous precedent. Bump stocks are not the issue, but if they can be banned, so can everything else, eventually. Now, Hogg, have your mom explain this tweet to you & hit me back if she wants.
2920 2018-05-20 15:48:35 Thanks for taking action and explaining to the rest of us how to do so. Bump stocks should be banned. #BanBumpStocks
2921 2018-05-20 15:48:14 The entire point is to make it harder, that’s the entire point. Anything, something, bump stocks, AR-15’s should not be in the hands of normal people. It works in other countries where they have stricter laws. The numbers do not lie.
2922 2018-05-20 15:48:03 Going to alternate crypto cycle with stocks
2923 2018-05-20 15:47:53 Ban bump stocks
2924 2018-05-20 15:47:10 No civilian needs bump stocks.
2925 2018-05-20 15:47:08 Ban bump stocks!
2926 2018-05-20 15:46:39 Not exactly that simplistic. U can’t easily get an AK 15, it’s a restricted weapon. U can’t walk out of the store with one and u can’t carry it around. Our storage & carry laws are very strict.  Bump stocks are not legal. Gun laws r the same throughout the entire country.
2927 2018-05-20 15:46:22 Banning bump stocks is the equivalent of having cancer and your doctors first treatment suggestion is to take aspirin.
2928 2018-05-20 15:45:33 Ban Bump Stocks!
2929 2018-05-20 15:45:22 We dont need bump stocks. These are ridiculous!

2932 2018-05-20 15:44:23 Yes, ban bump stocks
2933 2018-05-20 15:44:19 Never ever fall in trap of so called Stock market Gurus and advisors. Buy Good stocks having 6 essential building blocks -“POLDAT”: P- Processes; O-Organization Structure; L- Location Architecture; D- Data; A- Applications; T- Technologies. Use my “Capability Model” for selection
2934 2018-05-20 15:43:49 No more bump stocks.
2935 2018-05-20 15:43:47 Good God. We’re still fighting. Freedom from stocks. Please.
2936 2018-05-20 15:43:25 Explain why we had to deport a Chinese student on a visa purchasing ammo in Mexico. Ban bump stocks,background checks,21 yrs old,make gun owners reponsible for storing weapons ,wall and goodlatte Bill.124,000 citizens killed by illegals in Texas. They are more horrific than guns
2937 2018-05-20 15:43:14 Yes! We should ban bump stocks. It’s a good start.
2938 2018-05-20 15:43:02 SILVERLIGHT ENTERPRISES stocks slump
2939 2018-05-20 15:42:56 I’ll never forget when I was talking to a finance major & I asked him if he thought Tesla was overvalued & he said “idk those tech stocks are hard to value”

......bruh
2940 2018-05-20 15:42:25 But the EU's policies do not conserve fish at all. For example the allowable mesh size is so small that immature fish are killed. We could also set aside areas where no fishing allowed while stocks recover.
2941 2018-05-20 15:41:45 Stop thinking about it & do something already.  Invest in school security; man power & tech.  Outlaw high capacity magazines & weapons of war.  What happened to outlawing bump stocks? Require background checks.  Start there then tweak as needed, but start already damn it!
2942 2018-05-20 15:41:28 Feeling good bruh. Lol, ah man yea he left bout 10mins ago...in a wake n bake session talking bout a few stocks. How u?

2949 2018-05-20 15:36:52 I'd be a lot heavier into metals and probably still in some stocks. Also I'd be working a lot harder at my business, scrambling to get more orders, putting in more hours. Btc has allowed me to cut way back and enjoy life more. :)
2950 2018-05-20 15:36:51 Bump stocks & sales of semi-automatic weapons should have been banned years ago.
2951 2018-05-20 15:36:50 No need for bump stocks!! Eliminate them

2955 2018-05-20 15:35:09 Done 
Comment:
I support the movement for a ban on BUMP STOCKS.
I can think of no reason a civilian citizen would need to 
Attach a bump stock to a rifle to hunt animals or rightfully defend themselves.
Please do everything in your power to assist in this critical situation.
2956 2018-05-20 15:35:06 If your financial planning is well maintained with money in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Some of that money should go to life and long-term care insurance. 
2957 2018-05-20 15:34:44 Banning bump stocks is the absolute, minimum, obvious baby step to take in the movement to disarm/control the American Arsenal of Violence
2958 2018-05-20 15:34:32 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW!
2959 2018-05-20 15:34:20 Summer couldn't be coming at a better time.  Even as we see leaders continue to emerge, this market is lacking of explosive setups.  Yes there have been a few stocks exploding higher due to earning reactions, but we haven't seen any do it from tight coiled bases.
2960 2018-05-20 15:34:11 l'horreur absolue! Faisons des stocks de rosés immédiatement!
2961 2018-05-20 15:32:16 @cameron_kasky Did U know that 2 yrs ago the @NRA proposed a bill its called School Shiel & Congress knock it down. If passed would have put metal detectors in all of our schools, & @POTUS is 4 it along with banning assault rifles, bump stocks, more security.
2962 2018-05-20 15:32:11 We should have known that Donald Trump's promise to ban bump stocks was worthless.
2963 2018-05-20 15:31:59 Not sure of these stocks you mentioned but you can be darn sure I will do some DD on them
2964 2018-05-20 15:31:44 Las Vegas was 6 months ago and we still haven’t banned bump stocks.
2965 2018-05-20 15:31:35 It is guns.  I would add video games as well.  If you haven’t seen the current games, many are hyper realistic fetish sessions ABOUT guns.

Outfitting them with special stocks, suppressors, scopes.   All for hunting down people—not aliens or monsters.

2969 2018-05-20 15:29:33 Are you dense, or just willfully ignorant? When the Federal regulations on "Bump Stocks" are enacted as proposed, all Bump Stocks will be illegal, in every state and US territory. That's why we have "Federal Law", so it applies everywhere.
2970 2018-05-20 15:29:33 @zara_india hey .... So if a customer comes to your store at 8:30pm and looks for a shirt which he is so sure to buy.... Wats important to close up stocks or show him what he needs!!!!! Stood 20 mins waiting for someone to give me the size I asked for....
2971 2018-05-20 15:29:02 No...,it will affect the price of the stocks he holds
2972 2018-05-20 15:28:59 Ban Bump Stocks!
2973 2018-05-20 15:27:28 Thank you! Let’s ban bump stocks and work to change!
2974 2018-05-20 15:27:15 if Congress cared about protecting children at , they would install metal detectors and armed security. It's not difficult to research FACTS. If Dems want children leading their party, at least recruit the intelegent ones!? Banning bump stocks is #HoggWash
2975 2018-05-20 15:26:34 Buy a shirt at the game!
2976 2018-05-20 15:25:00 I could start with the PSEI. Stocks usually are the fast reactors and quick indicators if investors are reacting positively or negatively to an event.
2977 2018-05-20 15:21:51 Ban bump stocks now!! There is zero need for civilian ownership of military grade weaponry.
2978 2018-05-20 15:21:19 Corbyn in stocks here. Come and get it!

2981 2018-05-20 15:19:40 Ban Bump Stocks!

2984 2018-05-20 15:18:18 Which facilities outside France are able to reload those VLS silos and have the missile stocks to do so? 

Operating against an enemy away from your home bases for weeks is going to whittle away your weapons until ships have to go home to re-arm...
2985 2018-05-20 15:17:14 The point is this - you make it harder for people to obtain guns illegally and increase the penalty for breaking the law. Close the gun show loophole, reinstate the federal assault weapons ban, ban bump stocks, strengthen universal background checks.

2989 2018-05-20 15:16:18 That's why I never vote GOP. the cost of everything goes up.  I trade stocks for a living and this is earnings season for companies and guess what? Companies aar giving investors money back from their lowered trades. They're not raising worker salaries.  When will you learn??
2990 2018-05-20 15:16:02 True. Single Script Strategy may work for indices but when comes to stocks its good to go for porfolio selection model.
2991 2018-05-20 15:15:40 He caused stocks to lose value, I suggest hiring Michael Avenatti!
2992 2018-05-20 15:15:17 Ban bump stocks now
2993 2018-05-20 15:14:58 its random stocks. However other stocks selection criteria also provided similar results. Stock Selection Criteria like High ATR, High Beta, Random Portfolio, Dynamic Stock Selection yields similar results.
2994 2018-05-20 15:14:47 There is no real reason for bump stocks to exist, except for domestic terrorism.
2995 2018-05-20 15:14:21 I not really seen any big improvement unless you are in stocks. Unemployment has continued the downward trend. Companies are still reluctanr to increase wages. Prices are rising. Trade war will make things worse.

3007 2018-05-20 15:06:33 Also, bump stocks don’t miraculously change semi autos into full autos.
3008 2018-05-20 15:06:10 Started with the company I was working with and added others as I got older, but total value is not that much! I live on social security and stocks are for the extra things as needed! Good advice if your company has a stock plan or not invest in it’s success!

3012 2018-05-20 15:03:27 Ban bump stocks, nobody needs these, but people deserve the right to live.
3013 2018-05-20 15:03:15 the fact they attach bump stocks to them so more are killed and you lot aren't stopping the sale of them!!!!!!
3014 2018-05-20 15:03:14 Ban bump stocks
3015 2018-05-20 15:03:05 He banned bump stocks ( I know that is minor) obama on the other hand signed legislation approving bump stocks. When he follows through on prison reform ( which kushner has been working on for months) I will be back  have a blessed Sunday!
3016 2018-05-20 15:01:23 To be clear.  I support ban on all semi-auto weapons. Not just rifles. I also do not support conceal carry. I do not think any accessory designed to get around the law (like bump stocks) should be legal. I favor stronger background checks & keeping them away from mentally ill.
3017 2018-05-20 15:00:44 Thank you hun. You know me hahs I always tell it how it is.
3018 2018-05-20 15:00:18 We need a priest at every desk on the trading floor to work hand in hand with the young men trading stocks. It's a great plan
3019 2018-05-20 15:00:16 Thank you so much for the support guys! We might have been silenced but we will carry on the discussion of class in the arts.
3020 2018-05-20 15:00:01 But I bet you voted for Obama who approve the sale of Bump Stocks! 
3021 2018-05-20 14:59:50 Ban bump stocks.  It’s a start.
3022 2018-05-20 14:59:46 Nag abot lagi akong stocks mga dagko pud tanan. Grabe silaaaaaa
3023 2018-05-20 14:59:37 How quickly you forget that Obama had the WH congress and a super majority in the Senate. Did he do gun control NO. Did he do immigration NO. He did Obamacare as a legacy move. Trump is trying to ban bump stocks but what would you like him to do about parents who don't lock guns
3024 2018-05-20 14:59:30 Ban bump stocks and gop
3025 2018-05-20 14:59:25 Thank you so much David. It's fine we will carry on the discussion and make change for the working class :)
3026 2018-05-20 14:58:03 Was great to talk at the  #EquityARC18 about class in the arts, @actorawareness & #WhyTheFee Thank you to those who supported us on the panel, we really appreciated it. Just ironic that a couple of people within @EquityUK cut us short while talking about class haha.
3027 2018-05-20 14:57:35 The NRA is corrupt, they lie, and they instill fear in people to push their Agenda. They don't care about human life! The only thing that matters to them is MONEY! Ban bump stocks.

3030 2018-05-20 14:56:22 @AnilSinghviZEE Any particular reason why stocks like Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, Mother's on Sumi continue to fall despite posting stellar M-o-M sales numbers? #autostocksdecline
3031 2018-05-20 14:56:06 I've yet to see a clear differentiation between assault weapons and the majority of semi-automatic guns. 

As far as I know, aside from bump stocks (which are currently being worked on) burst or automatic weapons are illegal.
3032 2018-05-20 14:55:59 You should have been given more time! However I will get this on the agenda on the new Equity Council which starts in July. #equity #Class #workingclass

3040 2018-05-20 14:51:17 $STUDY $SPY (YES)  Don’t worry about catching tops or bottoms, that’s fools play. Keep the number of

lot of securities. -- J.L

3049 2018-05-20 14:48:58 $STUDY $SPY (most do the opposite) When I’m bearish and I sell a stock, each sale must be at a lower level than the
previous sale. When I am buying, the reverse is true. I must buy on a rising scale. I
don’t buy long stocks on a scale down, I buy on a scale up. --J.L

3052 2018-05-20 14:48:23 I don't wrry abt me as I am a trader but feels bad to see ppl losing money invested into wrong stocks n that too recommendations given by a qualified CA CS. Ppl don't understand financials n it seems this boy also lacks basic reading of b/s n financials. So most stks failing

3054 2018-05-20 14:47:22 We need bump stocks banned! I support the effort to stand up against the NRA who wants to continue selling them.
3055 2018-05-20 14:47:17 Ban Bump Stocks!!!
3056 2018-05-20 14:47:10 Own a lot of stocks do ya?
3057 2018-05-20 14:47:04 Stocks put the Individual Mandat…
3058 2018-05-20 14:46:00 Banning bump stocks makes sense. I can't believe that I even know what bump stocks are, our reality is unreal.
3059 2018-05-20 14:45:40 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW
3060 2018-05-20 14:45:37 I tend to like doing tickling scenes don’t tell Sir (even tho I’m pretty sure he knows lol) and he’s been talking about stocks forever. Now, just to find some lol don’t think they carry them at target

3066 2018-05-20 14:43:21 @selenagomez Unfortunately it is very difficult to stop individuals who have evil intent. If so inclined they will still find a way to hurt people.
Assault weapons and bump stocks need to be banned immediately. Donations to politicians should be illegal. They are simply bribes.
3067 2018-05-20 14:43:20 I’m guessing bump stocks can be 3d printed. This proposal is important, but still only partial in effectiveness.
3068 2018-05-20 14:43:13 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons!
3069 2018-05-20 14:43:01 Ban bump stocks.

3071 2018-05-20 14:41:39 If your plan was so fabulous, why did pharmaceutical stocks shoot up right after your announcement? Maybe you 'can't read'. They know your plan won't do a damn thing to help Americans or hurt their profit margins. As a former pharma executive, you know you did nothing.
3072 2018-05-20 14:41:28 Ban bump stocks

3075 2018-05-20 14:40:30 If any action is a no brainer, banning bump stocks is.  The fact that Congress has failed to act since 58 people massacred and over 500 wounded in Las Vegas shows Republicans care more about guns & NRA than about human lives #BloodOnYourHands #VoteThemOut2018
3076 2018-05-20 14:40:23 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3077 2018-05-20 14:40:21 Ban bump stocks now.
3078 2018-05-20 14:39:52 Reliance stocks to open low tomorrow over concerns about waning influence in non-business spheres which are of no concern to the markets. #DDvMI
3079 2018-05-20 14:39:46 That’s amazing!  The stocks are my favorite. I actually own one. Never had the pleasure of having a willing captive in it though. Love to see the finished space and you as a prisoner! Lol 
3080 2018-05-20 14:39:26 Get rid of bump stocks
3081 2018-05-20 14:39:11 Too much money chasing too few stocks. Recipe for disaster.
3082 2018-05-20 14:39:03 More than likely homeless because of a tax scam in the 80's. Called the trickle down effect. The others part is the doctors and pharmacy and drug companies. How much do you have invested in these drug companies in stocks. You Remember the NRA  and what said after Parkland.
3083 2018-05-20 14:38:10 Most Democrats & gun control / gun reform advocates just want: 1) assault weapons ban reinstated, 2) bump stocks addressed, 3) restore limits for gun purchases for those who are mentally ill, and 4) greater background checks all around & maybe a slightly longer waiting period.
3084 2018-05-20 14:37:46 Then suggests we keep handing them loaded semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks and armor-piercing bullets.
3085 2018-05-20 14:37:04 With a god tier name like that you just accept request and SD 8 stocks
3086 2018-05-20 14:36:34 If you aren't willing 2b part of the anwser, then U R the problem. How about if YOUR kids school has an active shooter, and YOUR kids have to hide in a closet. Those kids were sitting ducks in the very spot they'd hid to be safe and you're biggest concern is bump stocks?!
3087 2018-05-20 14:36:33 Bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons have no place in civil society. Unfortunately the NRA and it's bought and paid for members of Congress do not want a civil society.
3088 2018-05-20 14:36:25 I think you’ll find that most Democrats & gun reform advocates don’t to take away the right to self-defense. I personally want your 2A rights protected - I just think assault weapons & extreme loading capacity are too much. Even Trump talked about limiting bump stocks for a while
3089 2018-05-20 14:35:35 I sure hope so. My weed stocks are in purgatory since Sessions took over
3090 2018-05-20 14:34:16 Well thank you and I am glad you mentioned that. It just so happens I have an area of the basement with a “dungeon” effect to it. Perfect for what I’m thinking and I just may have to get Sir @RWMichaels92779  the damn stocks he’s been talking about 
3091 2018-05-20 14:34:13 Sir pls have some patinence....This year from Feb market has been very voltaile ...All stocks have suffered a lot...
3092 2018-05-20 14:33:11 Ban bump stocks. Then on to semiautomatic rifles.
3093 2018-05-20 14:33:02 @PiyushGoyal @PiyushGoyalOffc Sir make PSU stocks holding mandatory for mutual funds. Inc obligation gradually. Like RPO for renewable and achieve disinvestment target..Ppl of India will indirectly own PSU stocks @anujg
3094 2018-05-20 14:32:30 We can bump stocks!
3095 2018-05-20 14:32:26 No bump stocks!
3096 2018-05-20 14:32:08 So...going to have another fake media day and pretend to stand up to the NRA while 'jokingly' insulting someone for 'being afraid' of your puppeteers? You said you'd raise the legal age limit. You said you'd ban bump stocks. You had lunch w/ NRA.... = you did what they wanted.
3097 2018-05-20 14:31:16 A Super Smell Of Stocks ..
3098 2018-05-20 14:30:56 I support a ban on bump stocks, and a few other things.

3109 2018-05-20 14:24:06 #Ban Bump Stocks!
3110 2018-05-20 14:23:14 Submitted my comment requesting the banning of bump stocks. Took less than five minutes. Together we can make a difference.
3111 2018-05-20 14:22:31 That’s right, a deranged human will always find a way, but isn’t it glaringly obvious the amount of atrocities would reduce by a monumental scale if you take away assault rifles and bump stocks? I just don’t understand how you don’t find that reasonable.
3112 2018-05-20 14:21:16 No joke:
I make money off this woman's financial slavery.

I invest in Sallie Mae which fronted her loan. I also invest in "vice" stocks, mostly alcohol & cigarettes.

I invest in it so I CAN TELL ENSLAVED PEOPLE to stop lining my damn wallet!

I want it to END!
3113 2018-05-20 14:18:14 In the absence leadership by Congress, I urge the ATF to finalize its proposed rule regarding bump fire stocks. Ban them. Please.

3117 2018-05-20 14:15:45 Bump stocks and assault rifles are weapons of War. Banning them is the 1st step to ending civil war in America. It’s not okay that #286studentsmurderedsince2000 #studentlivesmatter @uscongressnews @UWantMyVote_Why @marcorubio
3118 2018-05-20 14:15:15 Ban these tools (Bump Stocks) of death 
3119 2018-05-20 14:14:59 NO we need the AR-15 and other “rifles” of this kind REMOVED from Average Joe/Jane Citizen. We need laws with penalties for buying, selling, and owning bump stocks. We need our children to OUTLIVE us.
3120 2018-05-20 14:14:21 Ban bump stocks!!!
3121 2018-05-20 14:14:19 People tell me I should invest my money into stocks but I would rather invest my money into myself, my family & by blessing others
3122 2018-05-20 14:14:13 No thanks @DLoesch.  The ONLY group to blame for these mass shootings is the NRA.  YOU spend tens of millions to make sure that the mentally ill among others have easy access to military grade weapons, bump stocks etc.  The blood is on YOUR hands, NOT the media. Nice try sweetie.
3123 2018-05-20 14:13:28 2 points I'd like to make 
1/2 Liquidity IS a problem in this segment. It's why MFs are notorious for calling a fund "mid/small" cap & having many large caps JUST for liquidity/redemption. So any fund with anything above 50-60cr would be in trouble if it's FULLY in such stocks.
3124 2018-05-20 14:13:08 Why is this even up for discussion?! Bump stocks should have never been legal in the first place! When will this insanity end?!
3125 2018-05-20 14:13:00 I agree. Plus when one takes an advisory service one is still expected to use their own brains a little too  Its not necessary to buy all stocks, especially special situation stocks
3126 2018-05-20 14:12:51 I thought Trump promised to do this. Just another lie. Ban bump stocks.
3127 2018-05-20 14:10:50 Ban bump stocks now
3128 2018-05-20 14:10:42 Ban bump stocks!
3129 2018-05-20 14:10:31 Ban bump stocks is the easiest first step.

3131 2018-05-20 14:10:24 So is it true that PG flippenfeld went to Paris for two weeks? if so is he trying to get them to ban bump stocks? We're getting tips on how to run a street car profitably LOL haha
3132 2018-05-20 14:10:12 I find that EXTREMELY hard to believe, all you did was copy paste stocks
3133 2018-05-20 14:10:00 Here's a look at how #stocks work. #WeekendReading
3134 2018-05-20 14:09:10 For Elon everythibg is affordable, even his stocks at current price, as long as he keeps finding suckers!!!
3135 2018-05-20 14:09:05 I have never even heard of bump stocks until Vegas. Really not important as far as where gun problems are.

The super majority of gun owners in this country are responsible and have protected far more life than theyve destroyed. That's fact.

Australia doesn't have #2A.
3136 2018-05-20 14:08:54 Each business will do what is best for them, of that you can be certain! 5 million got raises, and many announced expansion so we have seen unemployment to a multi-decade record low & stocks at all time highs! I will take that anytime!
3137 2018-05-20 14:08:31 No need for bump stocks
3138 2018-05-20 14:08:27 Ban Bump Stocks.  No reasonable need for civilians to have or use Bump Stocks

3140 2018-05-20 14:06:58 Yes, ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Yes, demand universal background checks and closing gun purchase loopholes, yes, support the kids in the USA who want a civilized country, not a place of barbarism, tragedy & gun violence!
3141 2018-05-20 14:06:32 Ban bump stocks and implement common sense gun laws, universal background checks! Keep us safe!
3142 2018-05-20 14:06:28 Lmao again my life has been 100% better since obummers weak ass left office and President Trump took control! My stocks are up, taxes are low, housing market is affordable, job growth at an all time high, unemployment at as all time low, economy is booming, keep complaining!#MAGA
3143 2018-05-20 14:05:58 Not sure about this tbh, just looks like a bunch of stocks thrown together
3144 2018-05-20 14:05:50 How about the same laws you 'put up with' for your car?  All gun owners should be trained, licensed and carry liability insurance.  ARs should be banned along w/ large capacity clips and bump stocks.  Check out civilized countries and see how they don't have daily shootings.
3145 2018-05-20 14:05:19 Ban Bump Stocks and AR15s
3146 2018-05-20 14:04:18 i trust you'll tell it how it is - we are counting on you
3147 2018-05-20 14:02:16 I'm "lazy" when I don't do laundry, I'm "risk averse" when I save instead of playing stocks Some execs are creative but all are business ppl
3148 2018-05-20 14:00:12 Ban Bump Stocks now!! There should not be easy access to ANY device that makes guns more lethal.
3149 2018-05-20 14:00:10 Ban bump stocks

3153 2018-05-20 13:58:51 Specify "guns", Richard.
I assume it was NOT assault rifles with high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. What's more, to my knowledge, in 100% of all mass shootings of the last 20+ years it was ARs - NOT hunting rifles, pistols or knives - that caused the high numbers of deaths.
3154 2018-05-20 13:58:37 The corporations that desperately needed a tax cut somehow bought back a record $178B in 1st qtr stocks, yet spending towards jobs remained level. Corporations win, Wall Street wins, and the dumb fucks who support the GOP think they won.
3155 2018-05-20 13:58:27 Also, if you watch the Los Vegas shooting and really listen, bump stocks weren't even being used. There were multiple shooters and no one talks about it. Wouldn't terrorists love it if we had no guns and no way to protect ourselves.
3156 2018-05-20 13:58:08 Yes Ban Bump Stocks
3157 2018-05-20 13:58:03 Ban bump stocks,Ban automatic weapons for non military,background checks and licences in every state and at gun shows,make parents also responsible if their kid is able to get and use their weapon for any crime.
3158 2018-05-20 13:57:56 I don't think it's any coincidence that $IWC contains a lot of names that have been popping up on my scans over the last few weeks, especially 52WH. I also see a lot of people on my feed mentioning setups in stocks that are in this ETF. Awesome to see traders ahead of the curve.
3159 2018-05-20 13:55:50 No wonder stocks refused to come down...
3160 2018-05-20 13:54:09 Bump stocks are only meant for killing many quickly and should only be available to the military who receive the necessary training.  Real hunting enthusiasts want a challenge matching wits with their prey. With bump sticks prey don’t even know it’s coming and  have no chance.
3161 2018-05-20 13:52:27 Bump stocks just don't make sense as a necessary piece to defend oneself . Please can we get this ban done once and for all?!
3162 2018-05-20 13:52:26 Dividend vs Growth Stocks video is already recorded - it drops next Saturday
3163 2018-05-20 13:52:15 I mean, you could outlaw bump stocks. You could've outlawed them years ago, which would have been exceedingly sensible. That likely would've spared more than a few lives.

Or, we could go full Australia and actually effect some real positive change. But, hey, that would be crazy.
3164 2018-05-20 13:52:09 Ban bump stocks

3172 2018-05-20 13:49:18 @RFGent1 Bump Stocks should be banned but the a-hole That approved the sale of Bump Stocks was Obama and you clowns praise every word that Wannabe Dictator says. He was a failure.

3176 2018-05-20 13:47:31 Please ban bump stocks. There is no justification for then beyond wanting to commit more murder.

3182 2018-05-20 13:43:36 We need sensible gun laws. Many think that people are trying to take away their 2nd Amendment right. Not true! Ban semi and automatic rifles, bump stocks & magazines of ammo. Register gun owners, background checks w/waiting period, ban the sale to ppl with mental health issues!!
3183 2018-05-20 13:42:54 Ban bump stocks!
3184 2018-05-20 13:41:58 #CNNSOTU really.  There IS NO ONE REASON.  Common sense gun laws, bump stocks gone, multi clipped automatic guns gone, better mental health, stop all the hate rhetoric.  We have a person in the WH who brags about shorting people and then nothing will happen to him.
3185 2018-05-20 13:41:21 Ban bump stocks
3186 2018-05-20 13:40:43 There's no need for bump stocks period!! We need to have common sense gun laws and stop making this country a terrorist country! Enough!!
3187 2018-05-20 13:39:42 Ban bump stocks! Save lives! Do it NOW!! #BanBumpStocks
3188 2018-05-20 13:39:14 I don't doubt about his knowledge of the mkt. He's highly qualified, a CA & a great analyst. Whatever stocks he suggested were all value stocks. But the time of buying was wrong. We can't b bullish through out the year. Now we have all good stocks but now 40% down
3189 2018-05-20 13:38:24 @SpursOfficial, make moves to sign players now before the world cup. Stocks will rise after world Cup

3191 2018-05-20 13:38:00 Stocks, bonds, notes, mutual funds, royalties, properties. INVEST. This money waiting on you.
3192 2018-05-20 13:35:33 Ban bump stocks now! It’s a start
3193 2018-05-20 13:35:33 Note: Though WASHINGTON POST aka WAPO  (still a NEWS CORP SINdicate)  sold such to Anti Russia Basher (Jeff Bozo)  AMAZON that THEY work in concert influencing Elections and Promote Stock Market Speculation (Gambling) in English Stocks, Bonds etc. And Fuel Panic in the Markets..
3194 2018-05-20 13:35:30 We need to ban...no need for Bump Stocks!
3195 2018-05-20 13:34:51 No more bump stocks. More safety and good sense. And kindness and  love

3197 2018-05-20 13:34:01 Ban bump stocks!
3198 2018-05-20 13:33:50 put my cock in the stocks n let the public dole out some punishment 
3199 2018-05-20 13:33:08 It has to be federal or it won't work.  Where I live, Boulder CO just banned all semi's, high capacity magazines, bump stocks... and not a week later Denver overturned a proposed rule to ban bump stocks.  BUMP stocks.  You know, the thing that turns a semi into an auto. Denver.
3200 2018-05-20 13:31:55 Ahoj Martine, nic mi nebrání. Akorát to teda ne zcela souvisí. Ale máš pravdu. Pěknou neděli. Ž
3201 2018-05-20 13:31:15 Cruz, all senators, could support Americans by passing federal laws to ban all ‘bump-stocks’; ban all auto-assault weapons; raise minimum age; require longer waiting period; require ‘trigger locks’ on ‘household guns’. Most mass killings are because of easy access to guns.
3202 2018-05-20 13:30:55 I think we can have guns, but it should be more like the regulations they have in Japan, Norway, Australia, etc.  No semi-auto's, and that doesn't just mean AR-15's.  No bump stocks, no high capacity mags.  Extensive training, certification, even gun safety walk-thru's.
3203 2018-05-20 13:30:36 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
3204 2018-05-20 13:29:28 Ban bump stocks, it’s a start.
3205 2018-05-20 13:29:23 ban assault rifles, banning bump stocks is a small start.
3206 2018-05-20 13:28:14 Most mass killings are caused by easy access to firearms. Must have federal laws to ban all ‘bump-stocks’; ban all auto-assault weapons; raise minimum age; require longer waiting period; require ‘trigger locks’ on ‘household guns’; have stringent punishment if laws are broken.
3207 2018-05-20 13:27:57 Ban bump stocks for our children lives!
3208 2018-05-20 13:27:23 Ban bump stocks. Now.
3209 2018-05-20 13:26:22 Ban bump stocks! #BanBumpStocks  We can do this!
3210 2018-05-20 13:24:28 Sam is correct on this one. It appears as though this point has not been legislated. I believe so far, only proposals have been mentioned when it comes to bump stocks.
3211 2018-05-20 13:24:24 Bump stocks don’t make it an automatic. Just a slightly faster rate of fire.
3212 2018-05-20 13:23:51 You can trade penny stocks as well and made even more, but you can’t afford it with huge investments
3213 2018-05-20 13:23:38 No - I currently hold enough oil stocks. Why what’s happening?
3214 2018-05-20 13:23:21 Sirji, how can we find such stocks , can you please throw some light on it
3215 2018-05-20 13:22:44 Get the necessary pack from yt I had those stocks
3216 2018-05-20 13:21:23 But I wonder. How does that benefit you? My stocks stay right where they are.
3217 2018-05-20 13:20:49 @kidolife   I buy with limit orders, and I sell with trailing stop limit orders, so my stocks buy and sell themselves.  I just report them.
3218 2018-05-20 13:20:24 With some #terms emerging from the #TradeWar investors can now invest with a little more confidence in the next trading week. #ASX #stocks #investing
3219 2018-05-20 13:20:02 Done. And thank you Emma for driving this and all your efforts on gun control. Fighting with you for ban on bump stocks and high capacity magazines!
3220 2018-05-20 13:19:37 Mass killings are caused by easy access to firearms. Must pass federal laws to ban all ‘bump-stocks’; ban all auto-assault weapons; raise minimum age; require longer waiting period; require ‘trigger locks’ on ‘household guns’ (prosecute those who break these laws).
3221 2018-05-20 13:19:25 The NRA owns to many of them. Even the bump stocks are forgotten about now. Ppl forget to fast and easy. The NRA and Russia seem to have ahold of us. China pretty much bought a state. We owe them a fortune. Instead of dancing with Trump, I would have recalled the loans.
3222 2018-05-20 13:19:14 @Geetu_Moza omc should sky rocket now .. Deregulation in full force .. Refining golden age going on .. Stocks should be trading at 12 pe and not 6 .. Exciting times ahead for omc ahead ..
3223 2018-05-20 13:18:34 Ban bump stocks, have universal background checks, and take guns away from mentally ill people.
3224 2018-05-20 13:18:22 Ban bump stocks
3225 2018-05-20 13:18:14 Most mass killings are caused by easy access to firearms. Must have federal laws to ban all ‘bump-stocks’; ban all auto-assault weapons; raise minimum age; require longer waiting period; require ‘trigger locks’ on ‘household guns’;
3226 2018-05-20 13:16:57 Army veteran and gun owner here. I say have as many ARs, high cap mags and bump stocks as you want. Because it’s your fucking right.
3227 2018-05-20 13:15:47 Bump stocks and while we are at it let's ban stupidity. 
Keep moving E you're heading in the right direction 
3228 2018-05-20 13:15:41 Let’s do it. Ban bump stocks.
3229 2018-05-20 13:14:37 Ban bump-stocks!
3230 2018-05-20 13:12:20 I’m baffled they don’t ban bump stocks, the NRA is even in favor of this. Just crazy.
3231 2018-05-20 13:11:54 I am a Marine Vet and will forward to my vet groups! Bump stocks should be banned! Automatic weapons are banned. In essence bump stocks convert semi-automatic weapons to automatic and therefore should be banned as illegal !
3232 2018-05-20 13:11:38 I truly hate this scumbag. Where was his criticism against Obama when there was school shootings on his watch and he did nothing to stop further school shootings. In fact under Obama’s years Bump stocks got approval for sales in US. Where was ur outraged then @JimmyKimmelLive.
3233 2018-05-20 13:10:21 Should we start with min age of 21 to buy weapons?
Ban bump stocks?
Ban silencers?

3237 2018-05-20 13:09:53 Done. 
Ban bump stocks. 
A bump stock, also called a bump-fire stock, is an attachment that makes a semi-automatic weapon — like an AR-15 rifle — shoot nearly as fast as fully-automatic machine guns.
3238 2018-05-20 13:09:00 Yes, the stocks are limited. ^AP

3245 2018-05-20 13:04:45 Just bump stocks?
3246 2018-05-20 13:04:15 No constitutional right to a hobby, 
"fun with guns", to own military weapons, bump stocks, modifications, silencers.....

There's no well regulated militia.
3247 2018-05-20 13:04:10 Sir, many congratulations,
3248 2018-05-20 13:04:06 .@ATFHQ Bump fire stocks are intended to circumvent the restrictions on possession of fully automatic firearms in the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934. Ban them now! #BanBumpStocks

3252 2018-05-20 13:03:17 Last time I’d seen a bump stock in action, the rifle still needed someone to hold it, load it, deactivate the safety, and then squeeze the trigger. But it’s the bump stocks fault...no it’s the @NRA...No It’s @realDonaldTrump to blame! 
3253 2018-05-20 13:02:51 Real Estate and Stocks are overpriced now
3254 2018-05-20 13:02:49 I am waiting for this to happen. Eying 2-3 stocks to add in decline . Hope your analysis comes true
3255 2018-05-20 13:02:37 Damn! I just read the comments (there are only 21,389 at the moment, btw). A lot of them are in support of bump stocks! Unbelievable!
3256 2018-05-20 13:02:36 Yes, ban bump stocks!
3257 2018-05-20 13:02:16 Bump stocks have no place in our society and should be banned.
3258 2018-05-20 13:01:07 Yup!!!! That’s all their stocks haha
3259 2018-05-20 13:01:01 BAN BUMP STOCKS!

3262 2018-05-20 12:58:27 Thank you for the opportunity to submit my support to ban bump stocks. I sent my comment.  Once again I feel young people like you are leading the way to a better future.
3263 2018-05-20 12:55:40 No civilian needs a weapon that can fire at the rate of an automatic weapon. Bump stocks should be outlawed. No ands, ifs,buts or whats. Ban them today.
3264 2018-05-20 12:55:36 I've always thought it weird people who claim buybacks artificially boost earnings seem to imagine a world where people are only capable of evaluating stocks based on PE ratios and literally nothing else.
3265 2018-05-20 12:55:30 Common sense. Uniformity among states to eliminate cross state gun purchases, make straw purchases & bump stocks sales illegal, regulate private & ammo sales, expand do not sell list to include diagnosed mentally incompetent & do not fly people, limit magazines to 8 rounds...
3266 2018-05-20 12:55:05 Musicians  alert! Maplins is apparently going into liquidation so get along and pick up what you can while stocks last...

3271 2018-05-20 12:53:07 Done. This took 45 seconds. Don’t overthink the comment. Demand they ban bump stocks. They have no place in civilian American life. That’s it.
3272 2018-05-20 12:51:49 Bump stocks have no intrinsic value except to kill as many people as possible in a short amount of time.
3273 2018-05-20 12:51:24 God so this is what trading stocks feels like.
3274 2018-05-20 12:51:16 I am saddened that I learned about bump stocks because of a tragedy. If this works I will be proud I helped. #BanBumpStocks

3283 2018-05-20 12:48:41 1. Before we joined the EU and had limits imposed, our fish stocks were near to zero and plummeting fast. 
2. You can't make people eat what they don't like - and what Brits like is cod. 
3. Due to global warming cod are moving north now, out of British waters.
3284 2018-05-20 12:47:51 Ban Bump stocks !
3285 2018-05-20 12:46:26 Isn't it amazing some wanted bump stocks banned. The NRA said no so that was that. I bet if a shooter hit a fancy private school where their kids are, all kinds of new laws would show up. Regan banned some when he and Brady was shot. It's called the Brady Bill Congress.
3286 2018-05-20 12:45:02 Ban bump stocks
3287 2018-05-20 12:44:22 no bump stocks!!!
3288 2018-05-20 12:42:52 Ban bump stocks.
3289 2018-05-20 12:42:07 Ban bump stocks and any kind of automatic weapon or multiple round weapon for civilian use!
3290 2018-05-20 12:41:55 Pay to whom? Import duties are a tax imposed by governments on their own people. If EU don't want to buy our fish, then that will mean prices in UK and healthier stocks in our waters. At least we won't need to throw dead fish back into the sea - both wasteful and cruel.

3293 2018-05-20 12:38:29 Universal background checks, a mandatory waiting period before purchasing a gun, raise the minimum age to buy a gun, a national database for gun sales, banning the sale of bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and semi-automatic weapons

3297 2018-05-20 12:36:52 It’s got to stop. Do our soldiers in battle have bump stocks?
3298 2018-05-20 12:35:30 Bump stocks should have been banned years ago (assault weapons too).
3299 2018-05-20 12:35:20 Bump stocks are not necessary for hunting or target practice. They only serve one purpose. To dispense deadly rounds as fast as possible, to kill human beings quickly and efficiently. Ban the bump stock. Now.

3305 2018-05-20 12:29:33 What I submitted

I believe every Inalienable Right comes with Responsibility and ask the ATF to clasify  bump fire stocks, along with other “conversion devices” that enable semiautomatic weapons to mimic automatic fire, qualify as “machineguns” under the National Firearms Act.
3306 2018-05-20 12:28:51 Health Insurance stocks, which have been very successful days.
3307 2018-05-20 12:27:56 Let's take care of one another. Ban Bumps stocks now.
3308 2018-05-20 12:27:37 It’s humanly possible to require mandatory background checks, yet you voted no after Sandy Hook. It’s humanly possibly to ban bump stocks yet @PRyan refuses to bring a vote. It is humanly possible to ban assault weapons, yet you take NRA  & do nothing. Perhaps you’re not human?
3309 2018-05-20 12:27:00 Of course bump stocks should be banned.
3310 2018-05-20 12:24:57 Swing trading is not for beginners or for people without a lot of knowledge of the market etc. You should not recommend this generally, because from 100 people 95 will loose money with this. #SwingTrading is for professionals #trading @6BillionPeople #cryptos #stocks
3311 2018-05-20 12:24:17 Civilians do not need assault weapons ban them in all of their parts including bump stocks.

3313 2018-05-20 12:23:29 ... What does that have to do with bump stocks? What do you think bump stocks are?

3321 2018-05-20 12:15:29 I agree that bump stocks should be illegal.  I have no issue with sensible regulation.  But don’t start saying things that just aren’t true. The high capacity magazines were banned during the 1994 AWB but the AR-15 was not banned just certain features of it.

3326 2018-05-20 12:11:42 No civilian needs bump stocks or any semi-automatic rifles! Time for the stupidity and the power of the NRA to end!
3327 2018-05-20 12:11:21 I am aware of that problem, and can see how bitcoin's blockchain could play a role in a replacement system. My issue was with 'tokenizing stocks' (as discussed above). Hope it works out for your project!

3329 2018-05-20 12:09:43 In a bull market, Small & MidCap stocks take a huge upside and fall down the most whenever a correction occurs or a bear market arrives.

For instance, during the first three months of 2018, Small & MidCap stocks faced the brunt of the corrections.

3335 2018-05-20 12:03:34 @MikeLoftusComic saw you on fox, subscribed to your YouTube. Good stuff. Will tell others. Thanks for the laughs. It’s funny cause it true.
3336 2018-05-20 12:02:44 Did you know bump stocks are still legal, and still responsible for the greatest massacre in this country?
3337 2018-05-20 12:01:38 Ban bump stocks
3338 2018-05-20 12:00:41 Bump stocks have no place in our society, nether do assault rifles.  I support our 2nd amendment to bear arms but let’s take that right more seriously.
3339 2018-05-20 12:00:36 Can’t believe this article actually says we “could have” banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to 21, as if either of those feel-good measures would have stopped the latest murderer.
3340 2018-05-20 12:00:30 Ban bump stocks now everywhere.  It is outrageous that this has not been done yet.
3341 2018-05-20 12:00:00 Why do we allow bump stocks? Please stop the killings

3345 2018-05-20 11:58:41 Owning guns is a right, sure...bump stocks, armor piercing ammo, tactical gear, and fire arms that allow you to shoot up a classroom full of 5 yo in the blink of an eye is nothing more than a privilege. Some privileges need to be taken away in this country.
3346 2018-05-20 11:57:24 I see everyone pays attention, Trump singed an order to ban bump stocks months ago
3347 2018-05-20 11:55:42 Lol. May your stocks require it. And don't forget to add  at the end.
3348 2018-05-20 11:55:05 Banning bump stocks is one of the steps that must be taken to protect our citizens from gun violence #banbumpstocks.

3352 2018-05-20 11:50:22 No need for bump stocks in any conceivable situation.  #BanBumpStocks
3353 2018-05-20 11:48:17 Ban bump stocks. Enact common sense gun laws.
3354 2018-05-20 11:48:10 Bump stocks do not make any sense except to kill
3355 2018-05-20 11:47:57 He chooses the right stocks though. There's no choosing the right bonds, since they're all shit.
3356 2018-05-20 11:47:38 IT IS COMMON SENSE TO BAN BUMP STOCKS TODAY AND THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SOLD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO START WITH!! DO NOT LET ANOTHER LIFE BE TAKEN BECAUSE OF THESE WEAPONS OF WAR!!
3357 2018-05-20 11:47:37 Ban bump stocks
3358 2018-05-20 11:45:11 Agreed. Let’s ban bump stocks #BanBumpStocks. It is unreal that the NRA is opposed to this when most Americans and NRA members are in favor. The NRA’s rationale is that it is an attack on the 2A. Absurd!
3359 2018-05-20 11:45:00 Ban bump stocks. There is no need for them
3360 2018-05-20 11:44:34 Ban bump stocks

3366 2018-05-20 11:40:02 Then at least roll out the solutions. Bump stocks aren't illegal still. I know that doesn't count for the last shooting, but it would be a start at least.
3367 2018-05-20 11:39:10 Ban bump stocks.
3368 2018-05-20 11:38:16 It will become compulsory over time. For starters, the less liquid FNO stocks will need to  be settled physically. That's the policy direction.

3382 2018-05-20 11:22:18 We have a tyrannical government now. How have guns prevented or stopped that. Also, AR-15s and other assault-style weapons, even with bump stocks, wouldn't stand a chance against the arsenal of the United States of America. So there's that.
3383 2018-05-20 11:20:41 When will the children matter more? Ban bump stocks, at least.

3392 2018-05-20 11:14:42 And I’ve been make the point... why do communities have to wait for politicians to do something to make our children safer in school? Just do it.. limit access points, place armed security and metal detectors... banning bump stocks won’t do anything to solve the problem

3401 2018-05-20 11:09:42 Ah I see, thanks.  The one thing I'd say is that cash ISAs are no better, but Stocks and Shares ISAs, even for modest amounts, is I think still a better option if people put in the time to manage their portfolio (for capital growth + dividends).
3402 2018-05-20 11:07:41 @cspanwj Ban AR-15s, other assault weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines & other paraphernalia; implement stringent universal background checks; longer waiting periods; enforce gun-free zones; severe penalties for non-compliance; register & license every gun.

3405 2018-05-20 11:06:37 We should seek out legislators in every state who will introduce bills  exactly the same as that passed in Washington state to ban bump stocks. This way the same testimony used to PASS the legislation, can be used as supporting evidence in other states.
3406 2018-05-20 11:06:18 No "bump stocks" or extended mags were used in the #SantaFe shooting and the shooter was too young to legally own a weapon, therefore national registry and mandatory background checks would not apply. So tell me genius, how would that shooting have been prevented?

3417 2018-05-20 10:52:04 Ban bump stocks!  Duh.  And assault rifles!  Really, could it be more obvious?
3418 2018-05-20 10:51:55 Ban bump stocks! And ban all automatic weapons for non- military use! Universal background checks! Gun licenses! #CommonSenseGunLaws
3419 2018-05-20 10:50:49 Will do and so you know, banning bump stocks is on the ballot in Georgia.
 I voted YES!
3420 2018-05-20 10:50:01 Keep looking at the Infra theme, lots of value can be created due to the change in the industry. A lot of infra players are injured which means good companies will create more value/ grow faster. #Stocks #Indian Equities

3422 2018-05-20 10:49:11 Yes, simplicity is good. There isn’t a single reason to allow bump stocks to remain available.
3423 2018-05-20 10:48:37 Ban bump stocks!
3424 2018-05-20 10:48:36 Bump stocks should be outlawed

3431 2018-05-20 10:44:38 What reform are we speaking of? I’ll be for it if it doesn’t effect semi- automatic weapons, because fully automatic rifles were already illegal to purchase since the ‘80s. bump Stocks are already banned due to recent regulation, so which sensible gun reform are we talking about?
3432 2018-05-20 10:42:51 Only people with murderous intentions want bump stocks. Banning bump stocks is a no brainier. 50 were murdered in Las Vegas with long guns converted to weapons of war with bump stocks. Honor the victims and their families. Fix this now!

3435 2018-05-20 10:39:32 Ban bump stocks, save a life.

3438 2018-05-20 10:35:02 So I'm off to the #EquityARC2018 with @actingclassdoc team to talk about class in the arts. Maybe doing a speech to the big wigs at @EquityUK might spark a change and get the much needed support for working class talent.
3439 2018-05-20 10:34:35 You bet! The lack of action on bump stocks after the hirrific Las Vegas murder Spree just goes to show - beyond the shadow of a doubt - how cowardly corrupt the Congress is. Banning bump stocks should have been the easiest, least controversial measure yo take!
3440 2018-05-20 10:33:15 Why don't you sponsor legislation that is known to actually work. Like raising the legal limit, banning semi-automatics and bump stocks, and closing private sale loopholes. No?
3441 2018-05-20 10:33:09 The time is now to ban bump stocks

3455 2018-05-20 10:08:56 Sugar stocks. Guess this is the time to accumulate. Many moved up by more than 500% in the last rally. Though the sector is cyclical, i feel that political compulsions will ensure the sector gets back on its feet sooner (before 2019) and farmer dues are paid off.

3460 2018-05-20 10:02:40 You are confused. The article referenced is clearly talking about the AR15 historically. Civilian use AR 15 rifles are almost assault rifles except they lack a selective fire. Bump stocks can allow for rapid fire anyways, and full auto is hardly any efficient way to use it.

3500 2018-05-20 09:15:29 Ever since the Dutch arrived in the City from C16th/C17th, the City has degenerated massively. They’ve made craft disappear for mass production...a necessity for these Abrahamic abstractions of ‘monetary’ fiat, stocks and bonds.

3506 2018-05-20 09:09:31 Then you aren’t listening. Common sense gun reform also involves banning extended mags and “bump stocks,” effective mandatory background checks for which loopholes exist in all but 9 states, s national registry of firearms matches with owners (as we handle car ownership).
3507 2018-05-20 09:09:30 Bump stocks are not protected by any wild interpretation of 2a. They exist only to circumvent law re fully automatic fire and to increase lethality...to kill PEOPLE. Ban them.

3510 2018-05-20 09:06:35 Nonsense. All but 9 states have loopholes by which guns can be attained through secondary sellers or gun shows without background checks. Weapons and accessories (assault weapons, extended mags, bump stocks) which serve no purpose other to increase human fatalities remain legal.

3542 2018-05-20 08:31:12 My reply was about the trading aspects. I'm not sure crypto is innovation. Equities were made digital long ago. In fact, trading stocks is equivalent to trading crypto (pure aspect of trading) but with a central trusted party, and crypto is moving that way too with exchanges.
3543 2018-05-20 08:30:35 Bump stocks aren’t used for sport they’re used to modify guns to boost kill capacity and must be banned.

If doubling down it reflect u r not listening market.if trading too many stocks it reflect u r not preparing properly.

3588 2018-05-20 07:27:56 No more Bump Stocks!
3589 2018-05-20 07:27:01 Just because prices of stocks are down 30-40% from their recent peak, it does not mean that they have become undervalued. It could simply mean that they were grossly overvalued some time back and are trying to correct themselves.

Price anchoring is dangerous.

3613 2018-05-20 06:53:58 We banned bump stocks in CT.
3614 2018-05-20 06:53:58 Ban bump stocks and pass common sense gun control!
3615 2018-05-20 06:53:19 Until they call in bomb threats and get kids outside or just wait until they head to buses. Or start targeting sporting events or movie theaters. There are no easy fixes. Do it all. Secure schools. Get rid of ARs, bump stocks, high capacity mags, cops in schools. Try it all.
3616 2018-05-20 06:53:10 Gonna put my money in stocks hehehe

3618 2018-05-20 06:49:53 Clear example of why investors should be careful trusting so called experts statement just because they come on TV/ Media. 
The statement made by him ( 17-25 second in video) buffled me. Which rules changed from 1 April ? And why can’t large cap funds buy small cap stocks?

3623 2018-05-20 06:43:44 /2 More directly, I would like to see voluntary background checks on private sales, bump stocks regulated as machine guns, a one time tax deduction for buying a gun safe, & future schools built with curved halls & more exits.
3624 2018-05-20 06:41:13 Guy at stocks: “what do you do for a living? Are you a drug dealer?” 


3625 2018-05-20 06:37:23 All lies. Not possible one guy could have done that with fucking bump stocks. Anybody who believes the official narrative is either completely oblivious or doesn’t care or both.

3636 2018-05-20 06:30:10 Yes to ban bump stocks. As a teacher this one way to protect students.

3644 2018-05-20 06:22:07 To earn some quick bucks, many colleagues of mine invested in Bitcoin when it was hovering at the levels of 18K. 

To recover their losses in Bitcoin, they started investing in Small & MidCap Stocks in late 2017.

After having lost their capital, they have vowed not to invest.
3645 2018-05-20 06:20:40 The biggest beneficiaries R those who earn more than the set limit qualified for a Roth which at 1st glance may look like huge income earnerd but 4 Californians, it's actually jst middle class. BTW, if u stil can't get 401k/403b, you can still buy stocks & withdraw 38K/yr TAXFREE
3646 2018-05-20 06:20:35 Looking for low-volatility or low-beta stocks can be rewarding. They are often overlooked. If coupled with good past performance, they may surprise you. 

It's a no-brainer. You want stocks that go up and do so in a straight line (low volatility or beta).
3647 2018-05-20 06:19:31 One should not get tempted by a call and must not switch his preferable sectors. Stick to few favourite stocks only. Avoid clutter in ur portfolio. It's very hard but not impossible.

3653 2018-05-20 06:15:21 Ban bump stocks now!
3654 2018-05-20 06:13:13 You can bump stocks? That seems like market manipulation.

3670 2018-05-20 05:55:52 Bump stocks are unnecessary. Ban them and AR 15’s and AK 47’s, all military style assault weapons. No need for civilians to own them. Period.

3672 2018-05-20 05:53:16 Not reading this garbage after quote: "we could have banned the manufacture of bump stocks, which turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones." - How stupid and uneducated is this fool about firearms? Obviously has never even been around or used them.

3679 2018-05-20 05:48:33 Why would they want to keep it down, everyone knows just how manipulative MM's are when their in the act of stealing shares from the dumb money, but in the OTC markets they are total corrupted criminals what they get away with, and steal stocks before they have massive run up.
3680 2018-05-20 05:47:06 Bump stocks have got to go. PLEASE

3683 2018-05-20 05:44:04 No automatic weapons, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks

3688 2018-05-20 05:39:20 Bump stocks are made for very rapid fire. They are made for killing the enemy in war. They should not be in the hands of anyone (besides the military), let alone one with mental health issues. #BanBumpStocks
3689 2018-05-20 05:38:13 Exactly ..what i realized most of the stocks who started upwards journey in 3-4x in year 2014 are in free fall mode as of now..we see ACC..ibull..star..SRF..SRT..beml..ajanta pharmalist is long. God knows where s the support for them.

3692 2018-05-20 05:36:20 I get that you are starting with the smallest laws first in order to start somewhere but you guys/we should start with the hardest things. Bump Stocks are a dummy issue that ammosexuals will gladly sacrifice in order to say they did something about mass shootings.

3694 2018-05-20 05:35:14 And I know crap companies that run off hot air or nothing at all...

Stocks do crazy things in the OTC - that's why I lean on technicals over fundamentals more...
3695 2018-05-20 05:34:13 Ban bump stocks
3696 2018-05-20 05:33:37 Bump stocks are not needed to make a gun work. To ban them is NOT about taking guns away or about the 2nd Amendment. It is just 1 small common sense step towards a safer country. Citizens and Congressional members should all want a safer country.
3697 2018-05-20 05:33:18 Ban bump stocks.
3698 2018-05-20 05:32:47 All right. I'm a prime member.

3704 2018-05-20 05:29:01 Warren Buffet sells courses on how to be a billionaire in stocks. No I'm just kidding. He does have a book though. Read it oh and Roger Dawson, O'neil (IBd), Peter Lynch and Trumps. Do not follow fools. Millionaires do not sell their secrets. They tell them.
3705 2018-05-20 05:26:57 Now is the time to restrict bump stocks. There is no purpose outside the military for them but to kill civilians.
3706 2018-05-20 05:25:51 Ban Bump Stocks!!
3707 2018-05-20 05:25:19 You obviously know nothing about rifles if you don't know that people have been able to rapid fire them long before bump stocks were even invented
3708 2018-05-20 05:22:54 Please ban bump stocks

3711 2018-05-20 05:13:55 Simple logic would also teach you that bump stocks don't get used in crimes.  But that doesn't fit your narrative....
3712 2018-05-20 05:09:14 How?  Bump stocks have nothing to do with anything... Try research and educating yourself dummy
3713 2018-05-20 05:08:15 Stop the madness!! Ban bump stocks.
3714 2018-05-20 05:07:31 Is this the same @realDonaldTrump who just banned bumpfire stocks? Wasn't that "Something"?  I mean, it was as irrelevant and worthless as every other gun control law in existence worldwide, but it was "something."
3715 2018-05-20 05:05:56 Fuck coddled defensive options, I want 3 stocks. Nerf rolling too lmao
3716 2018-05-20 05:05:46 The AR-15 was initially designed for military use but they passed it up for the M-16.
It should be illegal to convert a semi-automatic to automatic. If you can't kill something with 45 RPM, you don't deserve a gun. Bump stocks should be illegal. Biometric safes. Insurance.
3717 2018-05-20 05:05:39 Bump stocks actually make the rifle far less effective unless you are properly trained.  But you knew that right snowflake?
3718 2018-05-20 05:04:23 Sometimes, when I'm sad about guns, I drive over the spare bump stocks to cheer myself up.
3719 2018-05-20 05:03:47 Bump stocks have nothing to do with shootings
3720 2018-05-20 05:02:50 @amazonIN  I wanted to know how amazon ensures that sellers are updating stocks correctly? What action amazon take if seller is cancelling order after 4-5days? Why customer should not get compensation from Amazon and in turn Amazon from seller for default by seller?
3721 2018-05-20 05:01:52 Centre is the main responsible force here!

3738 2018-05-20 04:49:11 Time to hold gun owner somewhat accountable. The Dad should go to jail.   If your gun is used for evil you should be in trouble unless you report as stolen.  Harden schools.  Outlaw bump stocks.
3739 2018-05-20 04:48:46 Ban Bump stocks today. Ban military weapons tomorrow. And hold gun owners responsible

3750 2018-05-20 04:36:47 I think you’re being a little bit presumptuous I clearly stated that he used *bump stocks* (which cause them to shoot at a rate that simulates an automatic weapon)
3751 2018-05-20 04:36:36 So universal background checks would have done nothing to prevent this shooting. The shooter used a revolver and shotgun so it looks like banning assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks wouldn’t have helped either. I call it do nothing legislation.
3752 2018-05-20 04:36:20 Bump bump-stocks, they of no no legitimate use.
3753 2018-05-20 04:34:51 With the help of bump stocks a man perpetrated a mass murder of Americans for no known reason.
3754 2018-05-20 04:34:34 Ban the bump stocks.  Thank you.
3755 2018-05-20 04:34:18 Yes, ban bump stocks. After all, the pro gun fight for the right to own highly lethal guns doesn’t solve the real problems or root causes that enable a government to turn into a tyrannical government (eg control & discredit the media; dismantle checks & balances, etc)
3756 2018-05-20 04:32:35 I for one see no reason to own a gun. However, the 2nd Amendment gives people the right to bear arms which has to be protected. But it must be reasonable. Enough with the assault rifles, bump stocks and mega ammunition.

Vote Out NRA republicans
3766 2018-05-20 04:26:33 I'm with you! Ban bump stocks!
3767 2018-05-20 04:26:22 No. As a progressive I want reasonable gun control. People with violent backgrounds like domestic violence shouldn't have guns. Bump stocks should be outlawed. Gun owners should carry special insurance. Use biometric safes. Make a semi-automatic automatic should be outlawed.

Ban Bump Stocks
Vote out NRA republicans
3769 2018-05-20 04:24:06 Better room with someone bruh and start get some stocks or franchise something around the bay @VernonDavis85 did it smart
3770 2018-05-20 04:23:21 This should be a no-brainer. Who needs bump stocks? Who needs AR-15s? What are the people buying this junk afraid of? The NRA promotes this kind of thing for profit, and people who fall for it are being duped and manipulated. That's all I have to say. For now.
3771 2018-05-20 04:22:01 Banning bump stocks is a first step in reversing the ability of anyone to kill more people in a short period of time.  There is no reason to facilitate mass killing.
3772 2018-05-20 04:20:07 Thanks for posting this. Done and done. Ban bump stocks!!
3773 2018-05-20 04:18:46 fter and this indicator didn't give any warning.  Some people are saying that there has to be a negative divergence of less stocks going up while the market indexes goes higher.  That did happen in 2007 but didn't happen in 2011 or 2014-2015.
3774 2018-05-20 04:17:33 Bump Stocks take lives. Please ban them for life.
3775 2018-05-20 04:15:36 I just want to trade stocks  with a high return, I already targeted  several well-known American companies, I'm expecting at least  50% rise  in a year. I  used to trade commodities  in China, I prefer taking  some risks.
3776 2018-05-20 04:15:30 Hahaha, for the stocks which are in deep red, we become long term investors and wait till the price recovers.
3777 2018-05-20 04:14:25 There’s no legitimate reason for bump stocks
3778 2018-05-20 04:14:19 Hunting and self defense do not require semi-automatic weapons. We should ban them.  Bump stocks aren't needed on the streets.
3779 2018-05-20 04:14:13 Ban bump stocks !!

3782 2018-05-20 04:12:20 Dems came for bump stocks only to find out AR15s were still used without them. Dems came for the AR15 only to realize that other guns were used in shootings. Where does the ignorance & blaming of inanimate objects end? Where does the tyranny end? War is coming, the blood's on you

3785 2018-05-20 04:11:06 Closing the loopholes that prevent private sales and gunshow sales without a universal background check. Preventing the sale of ghost guns (those guns that are untraceable because they are built from parta rather than purchased as a whole). Banning bump stocks and large mags.
3786 2018-05-20 04:10:17 That’s this stocks M.O. the past couple days. Surprise everyone and take out stop losses, then a steady reversal. You can make gains on this if you set a stop, they knock you out and laugh all the way back up

3792 2018-05-20 04:04:53 i agree with you. I am saying about the category overall not about some individual stocks that you may find.
3793 2018-05-20 04:03:56 Lol right
3794 2018-05-20 04:03:50 Ban bump stocks. How can anyone believe that their right to own ANY possession is more important than saving the lives of HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN? #BanBumpStocks Sending your child to school shouldn’t be scarier than sending them to a war zone.
3795 2018-05-20 04:03:27 Bam bump stocks and AR15s.
3796 2018-05-20 04:03:20 Ban bump stocks
3797 2018-05-20 04:03:20 Dude, if bump stocks are illegal then nobody will ever use them and that will prevent lots of gun violence and stuffs.
3798 2018-05-20 04:02:33 Ban bump stocks now! We need this and many other reforms asap.
3799 2018-05-20 04:02:18 I noticed SA writers will pen hundreds of articles on differing stocks titled like "THIS had strong upside potential with risk". A few of them actually work out & years later they are like "I suggested this stock and not it's up blah". (continued)
3800 2018-05-20 04:00:48 Not sure who you are talking to but I have a job. I own a bed and breakfast. I help in my community and I volunteer for causes I believe in. Lately that means advocating to get AR15s, bump stocks and any other weapon meant for war off our streets.
3801 2018-05-20 04:00:36 i never give homie stocks to anyone because i always end up losing lol
3802 2018-05-20 04:00:06 Helene, I think you’re very good at what you do. I’m also very good at what I do. I wouldn’t follow you if I didn’t value your ideas. If you block me, you won’t be the first or the last but you will block someone who is better than most at finding excellent stocks to make money.

3807 2018-05-20 03:55:50 No brained to ban bump stocks.
3808 2018-05-20 03:54:56 Mental health checks, waiting periods, no more gun shows where private sales take place without ID and those checks, no sales of bump stocks or AR-15-type guns to the general public, licencing that covers all that, with 5 year checks like drivers licences.
3809 2018-05-20 03:54:20 Most mass shootings are done with assault rifles. These are rifles that fire with high force/velocity. Yes, the AR-15 is not automatic. It can be made automatic with bump stocks, which are also legal. I will not convince you tho. You’re too deep in the Fox News bubble

3823 2018-05-20 03:46:20 Bump stocks are totally unnecessary.  They turn semi automatic weapons into illegal automatic weapons. Stop the insanity.

3829 2018-05-20 03:43:43 I'd say 90% agree that a good starting point would be to ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Although not a cure, it would definitely make it harder for these shooters to have such high body counts. Just an opinion. Good night.
3830 2018-05-20 03:43:17 To earn some quick bucks, many colleagues of mine invested in Bitcoin when it was hovering at the levels of 18K. 

To recover their losses in Bitcoin, they started investing in Small & MidCap Stocks in late 2017.

After having lost their capital, they have vowed not to invest.
3831 2018-05-20 03:43:03 YES! Keep going, keep speaking out, keep pushing for sensible gun laws (& ban bump stocks), protect students & teachers, not the NRA!
3832 2018-05-20 03:42:43 There’s no need for bump stocks. They should be banned.
3833 2018-05-20 03:41:43 YES! Keep going, keep speaking out, keep pushing for sensible gun laws (& ban bump stocks), protect students & teachers, not the NRA!
3834 2018-05-20 03:41:25 I agree. Ban bump stocks.

3840 2018-05-20 03:38:05 Of course bump stocks need to be banned. This situation insane.
3841 2018-05-20 03:37:30 It's just like when Elon musk said if people don't like how volatile the tesla stock is then they should just sell their stocks and they proceeded to do that and tesla fell a noticeable amount that day lol. This is just on a much smaller scale.
3842 2018-05-20 03:37:20 Bump stocks had NOTHING to do with #Parkland or #SantaFe!!

3850 2018-05-20 03:32:40 It is a no-brainer to ban bump stocks. They have no non-military purposes.

3857 2018-05-20 03:29:40 ATF has comments open on bump stocks. Go and state your position. I did. Felt pretty good.
3858 2018-05-20 03:29:29 How many times have we heard about bump stocks except in the Las Vegas killing spree. I think that bump stocks need to go but mental health issues and access to guns by teenagers needs to be stop.
3859 2018-05-20 03:28:46 Ban bump stocks. Don't make guns more deadly, and able to shoot even more innocent men, women and children.
3860 2018-05-20 03:28:42 Morally, bump stocks are cheating; circumventing an obviously sensible law, to enable inadequate the weak to feel more powerful. Seriously, how were these ever legal? America will eventually prohibit most firearm ownership. How many more of your children have to die beforehand?

3876 2018-05-20 03:16:51 Palestinians hurling stocks and burning tyres against US backed Isreal seems a bit like David & Goliath struggle. Yelling Hamas is an easy excuse for Isrealian encroachment and genecide of Palestine
3877 2018-05-20 03:16:45 Opiods must be stopped at the source.  No other way.  Aggressively.  Put pushers in old puritan-style stocks 3 days???— then hard community labor— 3 years????  Burying the victims.
3878 2018-05-20 03:16:35 Of course the prices rebound. It does not change the fact that it shook investor confidence. Do you even know how stocks work? Shareholders are owners. Stock valuations fluctuate independently of their sales. Also, what is a Social Market Warrior?

3888 2018-05-20 03:07:48 Bump stocks are an abomination. Value children’s lives over gun accessory profits.
3889 2018-05-20 03:07:37 Because Volatility and Risk of Loss are strongly correlated. As an individual these stocks may be awesome but in portfolio context, in look back period these stocks would strongly correlated.
3890 2018-05-20 03:07:30 Bump stocks are entirely unnecessary. I don’t see a valid use.
3891 2018-05-20 03:07:19 Yes, he is. He thinks we should all have a choice of weapons, how many bullets, bump stocks, but women should not have a choice whether to continue a pregnancy or not. Womb patrol. To hell with the kids once they’re born.

3903 2018-05-20 03:01:36 Do we agree on banning bump stocks, doing background checks, taking guns away from Violent people, and raising the age to purchase a semi automatic weapon to 21 or 25. I am thinking yes you do agree on that.
3904 2018-05-20 03:01:23 Ban bump stocks. And ban school shootings. Never Again meant never, not next month and the month after!

3911 2018-05-20 02:57:00 Ban bump stocks
3912 2018-05-20 02:56:13 Why do you grieve them and do nothing about the guns and school? You promised to raise the age to 21 and ban bump stocks. You have done Jack Sh*t. You're the digest hypocrite to ever hold office. The NRA has you by the cajones. You must have severe back problems for all the flips
3913 2018-05-20 02:56:03 Ban bump stocks
3914 2018-05-20 02:55:23 Bump stocks have no reason to exist.  #BanBumpStocks

3916 2018-05-20 02:54:18 Trump is kicking ass. What changed in your life since Trump? More money in your IRA, stocks, or retirement fund? Because that is all that changed for me. I love it. Winning. Where is your head?

3923 2018-05-20 02:49:52 disagree ... there were plenty of nice pops on the way down, if you followed the charts. For the most part penny stocks are not for buying and holding ... just look at the people who bought $LG or $FAT at $1 and are still holding. Yet I continue to make money everyone day on FAT
3924 2018-05-20 02:48:59 The restrictor plate on the 1.5s is yet another blunder to add to @NASCAR's blunder list. Rookie Street Stocks +25 mph!
3925 2018-05-20 02:48:55 Like I said my state outlawed bump stocks I think marijuana should be legalized if that's what your Tweet indicates

3932 2018-05-20 02:46:19 Get in line with the Great Blue State of Washington and ban Bump Stocks. A lot needs to be done and this is a good start, but our kids lives do not have time for baby steps!!!

Bump stocks

3935 2018-05-20 02:45:06 Ban bump stocks!
3936 2018-05-20 02:44:50 Worth noting that they both played for Arizona/Sean Miller, so that kind of artificially suppresses their stocks
3937 2018-05-20 02:44:29 I’m buying crypto & penny stocks with some cash laying around. Buy & hold. Hopefully in a year they’d help me with a down payment on my multiplex if not..... hey it’s just some change. No biggie. Looking to 100x it.
3938 2018-05-20 02:44:14 Bump stocks don’t kill people.  People with evil in their hearts do.  And AR-15s are not automatic weapons. Nor are they assault weapons.  They are sport hunting rifles used for coyotes and hogs.  At least have your facts straight.
3939 2018-05-20 02:42:50 So, you're for banning all sticks if they're used to make a bump stocks?  While we're at it,  let's make murder illegal. You're deranged.
3940 2018-05-20 02:42:09 What are we DemoRats gonna do when people start making BUMP STOCKS on 3D printers... there are laws for ILLEGAL DRUGS but that doesn’t stop criminals #FACT #TruthHurts
3941 2018-05-20 02:41:32 But as Justice Stevens more or less said squandering their opportunity as icons on non-national crumbs.
Right now Gonzalez who said guns should be regulated more than cars is asking for signs on a Giffords bump stocks petition. These asks seem almost farcically tiny & doomed.
3942 2018-05-20 02:41:09 Ban bump stocks now.
3943 2018-05-20 02:40:38 In my state they have been and many other states I don't like bump stocks it reduces accuracy and they overheat your Barrel.  I would like to ask you this should the shooter be charged ?
3944 2018-05-20 02:40:19 Ban bump stocks
3945 2018-05-20 02:40:13 Ban bump stocks now!

3948 2018-05-20 02:39:31 #ban bump stocks
3949 2018-05-20 02:39:02 At least you are being honest about it while others are tip-toeing around it by using ar-15s and bump stocks as replacement words.
3950 2018-05-20 02:38:57 It is insane that we have to lobby for something as blatantly evil as bump stocks. There is no scenario that could justify the manufacture and sale of these.
3951 2018-05-20 02:38:38 I support banning bump stocks and taking weapons of war out of the hands of civilians. RIP to 10 more senseless lost lives yesterday at TX High School... 
3952 2018-05-20 02:38:27 Ban Bump stocks Now
3953 2018-05-20 02:38:24 Ban the bump stocks!
3954 2018-05-20 02:38:06 HE OWNED BLACKWATER.

DeVos is a danger to education with her stocks in shark student loans. Amway is a pyramid scheme.

The family is absolute TRASH.

Large contributions...impact countless lives... PLEASE. Probably for tax write offs.

I'm done with this. Mueller will handle it
3955 2018-05-20 02:36:35 I support banning bump stocks and taking weapons of war out of the hands of civilians... RIP to 10 more lost lives in TX. 
3956 2018-05-20 02:36:12 Bump stocks have not been banned!!
3957 2018-05-20 02:36:02 Ban bump stocks.  Sensible gun laws
3958 2018-05-20 02:36:02 Banning bump stocks would lead to most guns being banned in the language of how the law is written
3959 2018-05-20 02:35:17 Bump stocks have been banned we do have Universal background checks and what do you consider an assault rifle? .
3960 2018-05-20 02:34:46 Ban Bump Stocks now!
3961 2018-05-20 02:34:26 Lol so everytime he knows he'd be too tired to put up with me he stocks me up with my fav comfort foods 
3962 2018-05-20 02:34:18 ATF, please ban bump stocks. Thanks.
3963 2018-05-20 02:34:17 Three changes that would be a great step in the right direction:

1. Universal background checks (close the gun show loophole)

2. Special certification for assault rifles

3. Ban bump stocks
3964 2018-05-20 02:34:12 Ban bump stocks
3965 2018-05-20 02:33:59 More like stocks wobble upwards +300% since 2009

Each year the market destroys a new investor rule of thumb. This year is that “dividend stocks are safe”
3967 2018-05-20 02:33:23 Bump stocks BANNED!!

3968 2018-05-20 02:33:00 Ban Bump Stocks- we are in your corner!

3970 2018-05-20 02:31:56 Willing to try - ban bump stocks!
3971 2018-05-20 02:31:54 I filled out the form to ban bumper stocks
3972 2018-05-20 02:31:44 Nope. Learn how government works.

The definition of machine gun is set by a law passed by Congress, not ATF rules.

To "ban" bump stocks, ATF would have to classify them as machine gun parts.

They can't. Because of the definition of machine gun in THE LAW passed by Congress.
3973 2018-05-20 02:31:34 Trump has bumped stocks bigly.
3974 2018-05-20 02:31:08 Ban the bump stocks.
3975 2018-05-20 02:30:51 what is your specific proposals for an open minded person to evaluate? the gun rights orgs, seem to keep their proposals secret, other than bump stocks
3976 2018-05-20 02:30:45 Army veteran and gun owner here. There is NO reason for civilians to own assault rifles, high-capacity mags, or bump-stocks — if you’re that serious about this stuff: join the military or become a cop! #VetsForGunReform
3977 2018-05-20 02:29:47 Banning Bump Stocks is one of the sillier projects. Completely meaningless.  They just want a win on anything.
3978 2018-05-20 02:29:39 I support banning bump stocks.
3979 2018-05-20 02:28:01 YES!  BAN BUMP STOCKS!  BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS! #NeverAgain

3988 2018-05-20 02:23:34 These bump stocks should never have been sold to the public. We had a law against machine guns that the gun industry skirted. Ban!!! Bb

3991 2018-05-20 02:22:06 @kingsfoil2550 @latimes That’s a start, but we need much more re background checks, bump stocks, AR 15s assault rifles.
3992 2018-05-20 02:22:02 I will in the near future regarding: More women need to invest in stocks...
3993 2018-05-20 02:21:52 Ban bump stocks
3994 2018-05-20 02:20:23 Pass the simplest of laws. A legal gun owner has to, MUST lock their guns up when not in use with them. By felony charge with jail time. So easy, NRA has no reason to hate it, it’s already bought and sold, and would save a lot of lives. Can we just have that and fuck bump stocks?
3995 2018-05-20 02:19:08 Time to ban bump stocks boys.
3996 2018-05-20 02:18:09 Ban bump stocks.
3997 2018-05-20 02:17:22 Presidential tweets & policy affect the market, and also specific stocks. I don't see how Trump's behavior is any less criminal than Martha Stewart's.
3998 2018-05-20 02:17:16 poeple saying 2nd gen/1sr gen weren’t as crazy when e*f bought stocks just to keep a member from being added into a group hahahahahajsnsnhah
3999 2018-05-20 02:16:49 He forgot the Parkland kids the day after he promised them to ban bumper stocks and raise the age to buy. Did you hear him address the NRA?  They own us all. 
4000 2018-05-20 02:16:34 I see someone beat me to it, but I would definitely second catprint! I've been using them for years and I've always had good experiences. Good prices, great quality, and a bunch of cool paper stocks and specially options 
4001 2018-05-20 02:16:06 Rather than teaching how to pick winning stocks people should be educated about right mindset for investing. Imp point to teach should be investing is not a Maths exam where to be best you need 100/100  (hitrate) here even passing marks (40/100) are enuf with right position size
4002 2018-05-20 02:16:02 Ban bump stocks
4003 2018-05-20 02:15:39 checks, red flag legislation, limit ammunition purchases, stronger penalties on people who do not secure their guns, and (although you are a sponsor of concealed carry reciprocity) stronger rules on conceal carry, silencers, bump stocks and similar tools being used by
4004 2018-05-20 02:13:58 Please ban bump stocks. They are not needed.
4005 2018-05-20 02:13:36 A good time to buy stocks?
4006 2018-05-20 02:13:12 For a second I thought you said you took 11 out of 13 stocks and still lost

4013 2018-05-20 02:08:31 The AR-15 is a semi-automatic edition of the standard-issue military M16, which can actually be turned back to automatic with bump stocks soooooo... Also, all guns are not the same. What do you think can kill more people inside of a school? A .22 or an AR-15?
4014 2018-05-20 02:08:27 Opposition unity will drag stock market to 25k Sensex levels, where we started in may 14. #stocks
4015 2018-05-20 02:08:22 He created the bubble markets.
By homogenizing stocks unworthy to stand on their own, fund managers buy them up and only care about NAV and fees.  If a few crash, NAV hit is small.  Blending = Bubble driver.
4016 2018-05-20 02:07:48 Are you still selling these???
4017 2018-05-20 02:07:39 Ban bump stocks! Better background checks! Gun SAFETY legislation ... NOW! #NeverAgain #EnoughIsEnough

4019 2018-05-20 02:05:49 Now let me give you something 1. I see no need for bump stocks 2. I see no civilian need for high capacity magazines 3. I have No problem with expanded backgrounds 4. I have no problem with involuntary surrender in appropriate situations. See, I am flexible as are many others.
4020 2018-05-20 02:05:39 Ban bump stocks.
4021 2018-05-20 02:05:22 How does a save lives? How many lives have been lost to bump stocks?

Catch me tomorrow at Coffee Boys 22 
4024 2018-05-20 02:04:39 Ban stocks.
4025 2018-05-20 02:03:03 Tigre Géant est construit sur le même principe de vendre des fin de stocks ou des liquidations d'inventaires.
4026 2018-05-20 02:02:53 Yes but most stocks that the retailers buy or are advised to buy evolve out of the environment. That’s why the days of playing ball with the small & the (s)crap are behind us. You don’t want to lose your capital chasing returns. The walk to the starting point is long and hard.

4030 2018-05-20 02:00:25 People can 3D print bump stocks. This isn't enough.
4031 2018-05-20 02:00:23 Hard to contend Repeal would be incremental! It would be up there with abolishing slavery in annals of history. Much easier to rally around than say, #NeverAgain begging for bump stocks ban crumbs.

No orgs to repeal 2a / ratify 28a ever. The bravery required for it is enormous.
4032 2018-05-20 01:59:54 Ban bump stocks!
4033 2018-05-20 01:59:51 Thats great advice. I brought couple of stocks and they made new lows and I kept averaging them hoping to reverse but that never happened and finally I had to book huge losses
4034 2018-05-20 01:59:25 And no you can't change the law or ban bump stocks b/c you get 30K tweets.  Grow up.
4035 2018-05-20 01:59:02 @davidhogg111 thinks if lots of people comment on something it happens?  If that were true, he would be quiet, because lots of people have asked for that. More than will ever ask for banning bump stocks.
4036 2018-05-20 01:58:49 Ban bump stocks!
4037 2018-05-20 01:58:22 Kid your writing is terrible.  One or 2 mistakes and I wouldn't comment but every other tweet from you is filled with errors my 4th grader doesn't make.  You can "bump stocks?"  You mean like bump the NYE?  

Details dude.  Adults are watching and you're making a poor impression.
4038 2018-05-20 01:58:12 FC\TR beats RPG 1-0! One of our biggest wins good shit guys! MVP @ZombaCloud with 4 Stocks
4039 2018-05-20 01:57:31 It is not just a local problem. To remove 5 metropolitan cities, that is disingenuous. The no. of guns is the only common factor I think.  Bump stocks, mass murders by white men, etc.
4040 2018-05-20 01:57:10 Ban bump stocks

4048 2018-05-20 01:55:19 Please ban bump stocks

4051 2018-05-20 01:54:48 I’ll leave it to you but not me. For years, they are notorious especially that they like to slap iElfs with their SM stocks that SM will only listen to them and what effort ielfs do to keep SJ together is nothing.
4052 2018-05-20 01:54:25 Ban bump stocks
4053 2018-05-20 01:54:10 Ban Bump Stocks
4054 2018-05-20 01:52:58 I want bump stocks banned.
4055 2018-05-20 01:52:41 4/ in any case z/z ti has gone too far. Flat price is a function of US Stocks and incentives. Shale is all in. We will see US surprise. Arbs are now crucial for the next 3 mths @rajasark and i have large draws in the gulf which are set in stone by now.
4056 2018-05-20 01:52:28 I think he wants someone to bump stocks with him. Just 30,000 tweets and you’re in.
4057 2018-05-20 01:52:08 “I want a all black benz w/o no tints so you can see the gold glow when the sun shine in. Pirelli’s on stocks. Don’t want no rims. Just want a big stash spot to put this 44 in.” Talk that shit.

4059 2018-05-20 01:49:54 Lol, fix your tweet young lady. “With 30,000 tweets we can bump stocks”. Community college is calling you.
4060 2018-05-20 01:49:37 This is what happens when you think “how many retweets do I need to ban bump stocks?” is a viable way to create laws.
4061 2018-05-20 01:49:35 I'm planning even to rewatch :) S/R works for all stocks but it's amazing how big caps follow it..so accurate!
4062 2018-05-20 01:49:27 Bump stocks can be 3D printed. It’s impossible to ban them.
4063 2018-05-20 01:49:13 You set need bump stocks to hunt deer. They are for hunting humans, and there is no need for that. Ban bump stocks.
4064 2018-05-20 01:49:12 Just watched the video. Damn recoil is no joke. Those stocks are worth every dollar. My .308 destroys my collarbone can only imagine a .50 BMG
4065 2018-05-20 01:48:22 Why ban bump stocks?
4066 2018-05-20 01:47:02 Bee Stocks Hit Turbulence
4067 2018-05-20 01:46:28 Ban bump stocks.
4068 2018-05-20 01:46:23 The middle class owns stocks. Either through a 401k or individual investments.
4069 2018-05-20 01:46:21 You can survive without your guns. Ban semi-autos, high capacity magazines and bump stocks to start. They serve NO PURPOSE in a civilized society.
4070 2018-05-20 01:46:14 She's not talking about banning guns, she's talking about banning bump stocks.
4071 2018-05-20 01:46:11 You know I was thinking that exact thing during the open . It’s a lot like that. Street stocks Charlotte are super fun ! I win quite a few of those .
4072 2018-05-20 01:46:00 Ban Bump Stocks

4079 2018-05-20 01:42:46 he’s made the background check system stronger and banned bump stocks. That’s more than Obama did. Guns aren’t the issue.

4091 2018-05-20 01:39:48 If only we had banned bump stocks and AR15
4092 2018-05-20 01:39:32 Ban Bump Stocks. #NeverAgain
4093 2018-05-20 01:38:48 The NRA agrees that we should ban bump stocks! You realize this right!
4094 2018-05-20 01:37:08 Ban  Bump stocks. Now !!!!
4095 2018-05-20 01:36:17 Bump stocks are outdated technology. They have moved on to worse "accessories". Concentrate on limiting rounds per minute.
4096 2018-05-20 01:36:06 Absolutely no logical reason for citizens to own bump stocks or any military grade weapons.
4097 2018-05-20 01:35:55 "Yeah but today it means I have the right to March around open carrying my fully loaded ak-47 and ar-15 with bumb stocks wherever the heck I want"
4098 2018-05-20 01:35:55 You do know that bump stocks are not needed to bumpfire a gun
4099 2018-05-20 01:35:43 Ban bump stocks
4100 2018-05-20 01:35:39 Ban bump stocks.  Absolutely.

4102 2018-05-20 01:35:02 Does anyone here actually believe that bump stocks are necessary to bump-fire a gun?
4103 2018-05-20 01:33:49 Now  I am not saying we can’t try things such as banning bump stocks, doing background checks, taking guns away from Violent people. And possibly raising the age limit to 21 or 25 for a Semi auto firearm. But I can not support banning a gun. Or blaming a gun.
4104 2018-05-20 01:33:09 Ban bump stocks immediately. This should not even be in question.
4105 2018-05-20 01:32:55 Recently elected Sheriff from Macon Co. Howard Buffett (Warren Buffett's spoiled son) came up with this gem. Obviously due to gross and willful ignorance - and maybe that their portfolios likely contain big pharma stocks. #Scumbags
4106 2018-05-20 01:32:55 Ban bump stocks!
4107 2018-05-20 01:32:34 This isnt the race to find that kind of racing though, this is more like iracing street stocks
4108 2018-05-20 01:32:30 I support a ban on bump stocks.
4109 2018-05-20 01:32:21 Ban bump stocks, automatic weapons, clips over 10 and enact universal background checks. Involve police with drafting law. Should be same standard in 50 states! #enough
4110 2018-05-20 01:32:05 If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldn’t be in stocks.” John (Jack) Bogle
4111 2018-05-20 01:31:54 Ban the bump stocks!
4112 2018-05-20 01:31:48 One can't expect great bargain in high quality stocks.
Unbranded Jeans without discount=₹600/-
Levi's after 50% discount=₹2500/-
Big corrections in Nestle shares during Maggi fiasco, but valuation was not cheap.
Quality businesses always commands high valuation.

4114 2018-05-20 01:31:08 He blames other people for stocks not going up, or because timelines are not met. Could be he relies on others and can’t do his own DD, then gets pouty. Should be in the stock market playing the big boy game!
4115 2018-05-20 01:30:55 @realDonaldTrump @GOP you are F$&@ with My retirement my stocks my family.  Stop
4116 2018-05-20 01:29:25 Ban bump stocks
4117 2018-05-20 01:28:52 I use a NASCAR analogy as example: we've all tried the general car/driving/license/education argument, but I compare the high-capacity magazine clips, bump stocks, and military-style rifles to the high-speed specialized cars on a racetrack. Okay there, but not on the streets...
4118 2018-05-20 01:28:48 We have background checks. Bump stocks can easily be replicated. Your "common sense" reforms already exist, would harass responsible people while doing nothing to stop criminals, or are Nazi like policies of confiscation from minorities and women
4119 2018-05-20 01:28:10 I'm all for banning bump stocks but how does this work?
4120 2018-05-20 01:28:05 Ban Bum Stocks, Assault Weapons & NRA politicians.
4121 2018-05-20 01:27:40 Ban bump stocks.
4122 2018-05-20 01:26:43 Reasonable gun control shouldn’t limit your rights if you legally own, unless you want military grade weapons or bump stocks. If they could stop one shooting or save one child, what is there to lose?  Thoughts and prayers aren’t helping.
4123 2018-05-20 01:25:52 I believe bump stocks should be banned. Everywhere!
4124 2018-05-20 01:25:03 Ban bump stocks, please!
4125 2018-05-20 01:24:54 Can do the same thing with a belt, banning bump stocks does nothing to curve the actual problem. 
P.S. the actual problem is gang on gang violence which was caused by the war on drugs.
4126 2018-05-20 01:24:46 y is it important 2 have many sources of income?if u look at sources of income as leg on ppl, u hav a job, n hopefully a 401k/pension.But if u lose 1 its hard 2 stand on ur own.if u have another source like real estate, investments/stocks u stand on 2 wen u lose 1, more is better
4127 2018-05-20 01:24:38 Would like to mention that “nothing” is incorrect. Trump went against the NRA with the ban on bump stocks after Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS

4148 2018-05-20 01:15:50 You and the corrupted Anti American politicians are on their last breath....you have become laughing stocks
4149 2018-05-20 01:15:48 Bump stocks have no use except to murder multiple people. They are not needed in today's civilization
4150 2018-05-20 01:15:25 Banning doesn’t work? Well, we won’t know if we don’t try. Our kids are worth the effort. There is no role in our society for semi-automatic weapons with high capacity magazines or bump stocks.
4151 2018-05-20 01:15:11 Ban bump stocks!
4152 2018-05-20 01:14:17 but if we ban bump stocks, then the republicunts cant wipe out all the people who refuse to vote for Trump!
4153 2018-05-20 01:13:14 Bump Stocks are B.S.!
4154 2018-05-20 01:12:54 Van bump stocks ! I can vote and agree

4156 2018-05-20 01:12:39 Ban bump stocks and AR-15’s!!!
4157 2018-05-20 01:12:12 Nobody needs bump stocks.
4158 2018-05-20 01:12:06 It's astonishing that there's even a debate on bump stocks.  Congress should have immediately passed a law after they became known.

4171 2018-05-20 01:05:48 Same response as Jack. No one cared about bump stocks until Vegas
4172 2018-05-20 01:04:39 Let’s start by teaching respect for each other, and that breaking the rules/laws have consequences right from the beginning.  Enforce the laws we have, yes some change is needed, like bump stocks need to be gone.  Politicians need to get off the party deal and do for the country!
4173 2018-05-20 01:04:38 I am not good on "EXPIRY" ....  Price/levels is what I "EXCEL" in...

Ban assault weapons while we’re at it, close the gun show loophole & enhance background checks
4177 2018-05-20 01:02:13 Sure you can. And then only criminals will have bump stocks.
4178 2018-05-20 01:02:07 Are you at your ideal bodyfat? If not, simply prepare your meals ahead of time and take them with you. That way, you don't leave your meal options up to the guy who stocks the office vending machine.
4179 2018-05-20 01:01:27 - expand background checks with 28-day waiting periods
- ban bump stocks and other devices to turn a semi into a fully auto
- ban "assault weapons" (not by naming them but based on performance standards -- rounds per minutes)
- ban sale of magazines greater than 10 rounds.
4180 2018-05-20 01:01:21 If bump stocks are so dangerous and efficient at killing, why aren't they used in every mass shooting?
4181 2018-05-20 01:01:14 Well there you have it.  The left stocks together better than than the right.  Osborn couldn’t pass a budget if she was given the opportunity to.  #ABO

4185 2018-05-20 00:59:51 #ban bump stocks
4186 2018-05-20 00:59:29 Ban bump stocks, automatic & semi-autos. More restrictions & background chks on mentally ill access to guns. Stop selling guns at gun shows. Raise legal age on gun purchases. 18 isn't old enough to buy a beer but you can buy a gun. None of this means taking guns away 100% btw
4187 2018-05-20 00:59:20 Ban Bump Stocks!!!   Save lives!!!!

4203 2018-05-20 00:54:29 Ohh stop.  You know exactly what i mean.  Let us pass what 80% of country wants: ban assault weapons, universal background checks and integrated data bases, age limits, no bump stocks, no high capacity magazines.
4204 2018-05-20 00:54:10 Ban bump stocks. 100% agree
4205 2018-05-20 00:53:18 I support the removal of all AR, semi-automatic and military like killing rifles to be sold to citizens! Ban the sell of bump stocks and put our efforts of getting rid of the NRA and politicians who take their $.
4206 2018-05-20 00:53:15 No bump stocks. This is not a third world country. Our youth are being cut down physically and psychologically. Enough. Do the right thing for gods sake!
4207 2018-05-20 00:53:00 Ban bump stocks
4208 2018-05-20 00:52:50 #BanBumpStocks. Bump stocks turn a semi automatic into a nearly fully automatic. It’s ironic to note that fully automatics were banned in the 1930’s, thanks to Al Capone’s St. Valentine’s Massacre in the 1920’s.
4209 2018-05-20 00:52:24 Aren't all listed/traded companies 'shares/stocks' just tokens for them already?

4216 2018-05-20 00:48:40 This is a no-brainer, but much more has to be done than banning bump stocks.
4217 2018-05-20 00:48:03 @POTUS is supporting banning bump stocks. Support him and his policy
4218 2018-05-20 00:47:31 Bump stocks are clearly an end run around the intent of the law banning automatic weapons.
4219 2018-05-20 00:47:18 Banning bump stocks is the very least congress should do.
4220 2018-05-20 00:47:09 Eliminate bump stocks!

4226 2018-05-20 00:45:13 Bump stocks raise the probability of significant harm to innocent people. Stop the sale of bumpstocks now! Make them illegal to own.
4227 2018-05-20 00:45:10 MA banned the device, as of Feb 1, Its banned in CA. NJ, SC & cities Like Denver & Columbia have enacted laws prohibiting sale & possess of bump stocks.

4233 2018-05-20 00:42:23 Those who truthfully prioritize guns over life believe in guns over God. You can't be pro-life and pro-guns. The constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, but not bump stocks or without bg checks. We shouldn't ban guns, but we have to create laws.
4234 2018-05-20 00:42:19 Ban bump stocks & enact sensible gun laws.
4235 2018-05-20 00:41:47 Then enact some real gun laws: ban ARs and bump stocks and high capacity magazines and keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. #StopNRASponsoredTerrorism #NoMoreMassShootings #SaveLivesRejectNRA

School shootings are made easier due to a lack of laws. Why does TX not have background checks? Why are bump stocks a thing?
4244 2018-05-20 00:40:07 Bump stocks should have never been legal to begin with.
4245 2018-05-20 00:39:55 Ban Bump Stocks.
4246 2018-05-20 00:38:12 If you like your integrity, you can...

Sheesh.. Why is it that it's easier to fool people than it is to awaken them from being fooled? I voted for Obama the first go round, and turned on him immediately once I saw the price of health care stocks skyrocket.
4247 2018-05-20 00:38:04 Ban bump stocks!
4248 2018-05-20 00:37:51 Good choice but dividends are so-so? I said portfolio? You going to need more than that! I quite savvy about stocks so I know how they work thanks!

4254 2018-05-20 00:35:04 Believe it or not Bruce Wayne is my real name...then again I trade stocks and Forex in addition to Cryptos. 10%!

I am Texas born and raised. Card carry NRA "Lifetime" member. Concealed carry. Avid Hunter.
But ASSAULT WEAPONS are a curse on our country. END ALREADY !
4257 2018-05-20 00:33:42 What would be a good reason for Not banning bump stocks?
Nothing at all!
Ban them!
4258 2018-05-20 00:33:14 Agree, religious approach (e.g. “eco”) could clarify some of the issue. Though, it isn’t something specific to only institution investors. Great part of Tesla fans, who believed it saves planet, will keep the stocks in any circumstances.

Still impressed by 5 years stable 60% ...
4259 2018-05-20 00:32:20 Hi Kylie, this promotion is very popular and is based on while stocks last, however it hasn't finished yet. New Idea is running it until 24 June. Thanks!
4260 2018-05-20 00:32:12 Ban bump stocks.
4261 2018-05-20 00:30:41 Ban bump stocks, message sent from your “neighbor” in Fort Lauderdale.  I’ll be voting blue in 2018!
4262 2018-05-20 00:27:51 2/2 those jobs (for most part) are gone forever or robotic. TPP seems as if we are about to get back in! Coal is a sham....those jobs are gone already...coal is a dead industry. Tarrifs appear to be a disaster for stocks and for US companies...
4263 2018-05-20 00:27:48 I used to be a @jeffsessions fan he has let @POTUS down! He and #Rosenstein must be put in the stocks public humiliation is all these filthy liberals fear! #FireDOJheads #KAG #MakeDojGreatAgain
4264 2018-05-20 00:26:56 BAN BUMP STOCKS.
4265 2018-05-20 00:25:20 Ban the guns used in mass killings. No automatic rifles. No bump stocks.

4268 2018-05-20 00:22:56 Ban bump stocks!
4269 2018-05-20 00:22:54 stocks go up and down
If DT succeeds and we see a pronounced valuation downtrend, it can be said to be cause (abuse of power) and effect
For now it is honor and reputation damage due to Trump's lies and *attempted* abuse of power
4270 2018-05-20 00:22:27 Banning bump stocks is easy. Why not? What is the purpose?
4271 2018-05-20 00:21:05 theyre all just the same black ones too . he stocks up like the goth king he is
4272 2018-05-20 00:19:33 I thought the site where I traded stocks belonged to JSE, no?
4273 2018-05-20 00:18:57 Ban the stocks
4274 2018-05-20 00:18:55 Ban bump stocks.
4275 2018-05-20 00:18:46 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
4276 2018-05-20 00:18:15 Unless you're planning​ to kill a lot of people, bump stocks are irrelevant. Ban them now!
4277 2018-05-20 00:17:39 Yes. Bump stocks. Now

4279 2018-05-20 00:17:30 And what happens when people stop trading their stocks because they don’t want to pay the tax?
4280 2018-05-20 00:17:21 Correction, stocks have fallen more in the last six months than any Time during Obama's term, can you name one law Trump has enacted to help
4281 2018-05-20 00:16:58 Ban Bump Stocks. Well demand change & more protections from the guns in the wrong hands.

4283 2018-05-20 00:16:23 That's a lie, and Obama actually made laws that helped, when Bush left office , auto, housing and stocks were failing, he saved GM and Ford, saved the housing, and stocks have been on the rise since
4284 2018-05-20 00:14:58 Ban bump stocks!
4285 2018-05-20 00:14:34 Ban bump stocks
4286 2018-05-20 00:14:28 It must have been lovely to be in a position to buy. I've never heard a more tone-deaf comment from a sitting p.m.
People were losing jobs and not thinking about buying bargain stocks
4287 2018-05-20 00:14:16 Ban bump stocks
4288 2018-05-20 00:14:10 Ban bump stocks and all assault weapons. This is stupid. More people have died this year IN SCHOOL than service members in combat.
4289 2018-05-20 00:13:46 Ban bump stocks! My 10 year old daughter is scared to go to school! This is America! This should not be happening!! #EnoughIsEnough
4290 2018-05-20 00:13:39 You can have your guns. Just no military style weapons, bump stocks, or high quantity magazines/clips. Also...register all your guns in a national database. Get a license. Show proof you've taken a safety class. Get insurance.

You know. The type of things required to own a car.
4291 2018-05-20 00:13:34 In the time it took me to go to the kitchen and grab a snack Crush took 3 of SFAT’s stocks in a game that hadn’t even started when I got up. Jesus
4292 2018-05-20 00:12:36 What a BS artist u are - voted against background checks, bump stocks multi magazine restrictions - 77,000 u got from the NRA - as long as the NRA owns the GOP we can expect more of the same
4293 2018-05-20 00:12:28 I would love to see bump stocks banned in the next year. You can do it!
4294 2018-05-20 00:12:27 Ban bump stocks!
4295 2018-05-20 00:12:04 Bump stocks should have been banned before Las Vegas, and for sure within a week after.

4296 2018-05-20 00:11:59 My friend Jim asks what Congress could do to prevent gun violence:
1. Fund research on solutions.
2. Ban assault rifles & bump stocks.
3. Universal background checks.
4. 21 minimum age to buy.
5. Mandatory wait to buy.
6. Parent liability for unsecured gun used by minor in crime.
4297 2018-05-20 00:10:03 I ain sellin nothing but stocks n coins 
4298 2018-05-20 00:09:52 These bump stocks being legal is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t know what it is going to take

4300 2018-05-20 00:09:34 Ban bump stocks!
4301 2018-05-20 00:09:12 I don't care about bump stocks, but we should actually be scared by the idea that politics are being used to change a regulation originally decided by science and law.  If you want to ban bump stocks, you need to change the law not reinterpret truth
4302 2018-05-20 00:08:28 Ban bump stocks
4303 2018-05-20 00:08:28 Ban bump stocks, you know it is the right thing to do. Do the right thing.
4304 2018-05-20 00:08:07 This is my life in AZ. When I first moved here I went to hang out with Wobbles, Axe, and Taj and I don't think I've ever lost so many stocks in my entire life in a single sitting before.
4305 2018-05-20 00:08:05 Ban bump stocks.
4306 2018-05-20 00:07:00 Ban bump stocks and anything else that can convert guns to any form of rapid fire weapon
4307 2018-05-20 00:06:51 Ban bump stocks. We need sensible gun laws.

4313 2018-05-20 00:04:14 The advertisement you posted was for the RNC not specifically for the Trump campaign, further, it did not deal with the school shooting, did not mention it, only mentioned repeal of bump stocks.  Also, where did you get that ad?  I cannot find it.
4314 2018-05-20 00:04:06 Ban bump stocks

4317 2018-05-20 00:01:49 Ban bump stocks. Require private sales/gifts of guns to have background checks.
4318 2018-05-20 00:00:17 My work only stocks unisex that are WAY too long and don't have nearly enough room for the lady booty. Grey's anatomy scrubs for life, I never want to take them off!

4321 2018-05-18 23:59:52 Francis took a soft more sympathetic view to Chavezism, now its more like Nazism. The Vatican has stocks, lives  off those who donate .The Left has departed the Church, the center, right alone,remain why continue to insult the center  and workeres with Fidel moments. @seanhannity
4322 2018-05-18 23:59:46 Thanks for the reply man. I actually was thinking about opening up a tradenet account to be able to short some of these crap stocks since borrow are SOOO hard to fine and expensive with htb fees.
4323 2018-05-18 23:59:40 Congress: "oh, I know. remember those bump stocks we were promising to ban after the LV massacre? Let's pretend we're actually, really, TRULY going to do that this time, until people look in another direction."
4324 2018-05-18 23:57:41 No one says to take all guns, Except the fringe and both sides have extremists.  Bump stocks are low hanging fruit that even trump said he was banning......until he had an nra meeting and nothing else was said. #EnoughIsEnough
4325 2018-05-18 23:57:34 Amd is good this year their processors are actually top notch. Fast money is stupid. I can find 4 stocks in any industry in correction and call it a wreck.
4326 2018-05-18 23:57:18 Lousy wannabe criminals should be sent to that other medieval institution,the stocks,not the Lords
4327 2018-05-18 23:57:16 You’re the first person I’ve heard say this so it’s not common sense. I don’t see how your corrected numbers are needed in say, banning bump stocks or more intensive background checks
4328 2018-05-18 23:57:05 So how much would have been prevented today if AR-15's and bump stocks were banned? I'll wait.
4329 2018-05-18 23:57:01 Banning bump stocks would not have affected the shooting. It was a shotgun and a revolver. The weapons were stolen from his father so raising the age to 21 would not have affected this. There are no laws controlling the pressure cooker bomb he had. But yeah it's the NRA's fault.

And finally ban assault rifles (that’s for show, since it would do the world a favor by shutting up the under educated by banning guns already banned). Hold organizations accountable that don’t report data for background checks.

4359 2018-05-18 23:45:31 A ban on bump stocks would prevent semi automatic rifles from functioning as full automatic assault rifles - but does not infringe on #2A rights. #iagov #iapolitics
4360 2018-05-18 23:45:00 AR-15s are the problem. Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
4361 2018-05-18 23:44:40 Someone said today Wi/synco had a firesale today w/ stocks.
4362 2018-05-18 23:43:39 Sen Smith and her husband Archie Smith own a medical hedgefund full of medical device and pharma stocks.
4363 2018-05-18 23:43:03 Background checks are all gun purchases, no automatic weapons, no bumo stocks, put a cap on the number of weapons people can purchase. Improved, free, access to mental health resources in schools and the broader community. #MASA Make America Safe Again.
4364 2018-05-18 23:42:53 That fucker bought something like 30+ AR-15’s and AR-10’s, dozens of 100 magazines, scopes, bump stocks and thousands of rounds of ammo in less than a year. Door control is totally the problem.
4365 2018-05-18 23:41:24 No Assault rifles, no extended mags, no bump stocks, stronger background checks, no gun show loop hole... just for starters
4366 2018-05-18 23:38:47 Le pire c’est pour les promos, quand y en a plus et que les clients forcent pour des équivalents alors que non « dans la limite des stocks disponible ». Le pire c’est quand une cliente m’a accuser de lui avoir voler son cadis alors que je faisais ma mise en rayon 
4367 2018-05-18 23:37:25 Any recommendations for learning about charting stocks ? Books? YouTube videos ? Documents ? Websites ?
4368 2018-05-18 23:36:23 I’m pretty sure I’ve used every type you could think of. So I guess there all military style. Bump stocks 
4369 2018-05-18 23:35:37 Only Stever Forbes would believe that $575 a month for a single prescription is a deal.  How you liking those Pharma stocks Steve?
4370 2018-05-18 23:34:48 The way his tweet is worded it sounds like he’s talking about stocks not about people who lost their lives.
4371 2018-05-18 23:34:13 Actually those numbers are from the U.S Labor department.  How does the stock market help you?  Do you have lots of stocks?
4372 2018-05-18 23:33:05 No way you can change our culture. I am from Texas everyone has guns. What we have to stop is semi-automatic weapons large cartridge cases and bump stocks. No one but the military that surrounded had weapons of war. This is change that needs to happen no civilian needs an AR-15
4373 2018-05-18 23:33:03 So many stocks.  Which one 

Money.  The world revolves around it.
4374 2018-05-18 23:32:50 the NRA also promotes the sales of bump stocks that can make a semi automatic weapon fully automatic which means its causes more damage
4375 2018-05-18 23:32:15 Agreed. What do we do. Who owns the healthcare stocks? Who receives the Pharma donations?
4376 2018-05-18 23:30:54 The 2 biggest markets to be in now marijuana and energy stocks.
4377 2018-05-18 23:30:40 You mention bump stocks. Are you suggesting a ban on bump stocks or heavy regulation?
4378 2018-05-18 23:29:57 Pr que leurs stocks s'epuisent, il faut arracher, dechirer et bruler

Sinon, ils iront les recuperer pr les remettre ds le circuit.

PRECISION: Il s'agit uniquement des drapeaux sur les immeubles publics (ex. #RTNC | REGIDESO), pas sur les Immeubles Prives des Partis Politiques
4379 2018-05-18 23:28:45 Very true, could have put it in FANG stocks with less risk. I guess its what you believe in and are willing to take the risk on. Could have made lots in crypto toooo lol
4380 2018-05-18 23:28:29 +$28 for this week, wasn't to much in play for the stocks I'm holding yet. Still holding $COKE and $BUD, I believe these will reverse in the near future. The overall stock market was choppy for today.
4381 2018-05-18 23:28:04 Trucks pulling up to your building? you ever look to see the co. name on the products? I was near a company when two trucks pulled up, Zep, and Quaker Chemical. Few weeks later seen the same trucks, and again. I checked the stocks and bought them. Earnings pushed shares higher.

4383 2018-05-18 23:26:57 @RobinhoodApp Hey guys do you have an idea of when you will offer shortselling? I love you guys But I prefer shorting stocks. Thanks again
4384 2018-05-18 23:26:17 I dunno so many false calls. I give up. I’ll never afford a house or condo or rent.  And mine as well stay fully invested in stocks or I’ll miss out on new highs.
4385 2018-05-18 23:25:28 Just invested in 2 stocks 
4386 2018-05-18 23:25:24 YOUR STOCKS ARE TANKING BECAUSE NORMAL CUSTOMERS CAN'T AFFORD YOUR SOUPS. I DON'T LIKE EATING OTHER BRANDS BUT I CAN BUY THEM AT HALF YOUR PRICE.
4387 2018-05-18 23:23:57 Am sure he’s quite invested in private prison stocks. Dig deeper it will be found. Get him out of public service
4388 2018-05-18 23:23:15 Trying to find out what stocks im in.  Cause you dumb

D U M B
4389 2018-05-18 23:20:49 I knew about the bump stocks for the same reason, but didn't know that most guns were the same (assuming my gun owner friends are correct, of course).  I just wanted to explain how that'd fit into larger legislation. :)
4390 2018-05-18 23:20:36 The scary looking ones with big bullets and bump stocks..
4391 2018-05-18 23:20:15 It's a good idea to invest in stocks, which is why I bought shares in Bisto.
4392 2018-05-18 23:19:51 not nearly as much as I have to listen to silver spoon elitists that now live upstate ... more “kids” die from opioids today than MAGA supporters (none) but i’m sure all those stocks are a “buy” #sanctimoniuos
4393 2018-05-18 23:18:41 No;
the real worry on #stocks is that stocks now visibly an unsustainable bubble - same pattern housing went:
soaring prices while incomes near-flat and many incomes nil - and investors finally see that.
4394 2018-05-18 23:18:23 Cramer pushes (pun intented) pot stocks and you all stand by while oil equities lift off. I don't understand
4395 2018-05-18 23:17:22 May 20 to may 26 2018 will be the time that world changes permanetly. Soon after, stocks and bonds etc. Will plunge like titanic. You should be on #BTC #LTC #GOLD #Silver  to be safe. Mark my words (well not mine, but mark it )@bensemchee @GregMannarino  MAY day MAY day MAY day
4396 2018-05-18 23:17:03 I lean further to the left on gun control than any political issue. I'm all for banning assault weapons, stricter background checks, banning bump stocks, etc. Having said that, none of those things would have prevented #SantaFe or most other recent mass shootings from happening.
4397 2018-05-18 23:16:51 Let's start with:
1.  Holding owner accountable if someone commits a crime w your gun
2. Banning assault weapons & bump stocks
3. Raising legal purchase age
4. Strengthening background checks
5. Closing loopholes (e.g. Indiana/Illinois)
4398 2018-05-18 23:16:38 Would any #GunControl politics have stopped Santa Fe shooter?

Banning AR-15s - NO
Banning high capacity magazines - NO
Banning bump stocks - NO
Universal background checks - NO
Background checks for ammo - NO
Raising minimum age for gun purchases to 21 - NO

Metal detector yes!

4400 2018-05-18 23:14:30 These names all have the most liquidity and always have nice ranges. So for options you dont really need to go outside of these stocks to always have something to trade. Every now and then there is something else moving with liquidity that I will play but for the most part these
4401 2018-05-18 23:14:15 For the past hour or so, I’ve been trimming and re-vasing roses, vasing up stocks, baking breakfast muffins. The place smells like heaven.
4402 2018-05-18 23:13:37 BTC has value because people perceive it as valuable. Similarly to the cash in your pocket or the stocks in your example.

4412 2018-05-18 23:11:20 You anti gun people can't bitch about automatic weapons and bumps stocks this time. Shotgun, handgun owned legally by the dad. IT'S A PEOPLE PROBLEM NOT A GUN PROBLEM #peoplekill #gunsdont
4413 2018-05-18 23:10:11 Republicans and the NRA gin up the crazies in order for the gun manufacturers to sell more guns. That's why they demonize all Dems. It's no coincidence that gun mfr stocks went through the roof while Obama was President.
4414 2018-05-18 23:10:03 yeah... it looks HORRIBLE! Might as well be street stocks out there.

4417 2018-05-18 23:08:47 While I'm ok with bump stocks being banned, to my knowledge, they weren't used. Shotgun, and hand gun. The left is down with confiscation.

4426 2018-05-18 23:02:20 Even if Tiger never gets past 14, it’s still more impressive than Jack’s 19. Nobody is ever going to reach 10 again. Marc Leishman and Webb Simpson are laughing stocks on the PGA Tour and they’re randomly shattering records back to back weeks. Golfers weren’t this good back then.
4427 2018-05-18 23:02:17 Oh I saw videos and articles about the bump stocks after the Parkland incident, so I knew about that already. Thanks for clarifying regardless. I remember watching a Steve crowder video with the bump stock and he said, "My cameraman just pissed his pants." LOL
4428 2018-05-18 23:00:33 Nah, not me.

Active underperforms in aggregate, so wouldn't those stocks be responsive for the negative alpha? Give me the stocks ignored by active managers instead.
4429 2018-05-18 22:59:37 Oh, no problem!  What I'm talking about is referring to bump stocks (sp?) and being told that a standard hunting rifle can be modified just as, say, an AR-15 can.  Several shooters have used modified weapons.  And even if bump stocks are outlawed, people may/can modify it alone.
4430 2018-05-18 22:58:58 Background checks, more restrictions on guns, and no bump stocks.

4436 2018-05-18 22:54:19 Your prayers have done nothing. It is beyond time to take action. If you truly cared about stopping these attacks, you would forgo the @NRA blood money and enact AR bans, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. #RubioEnablesMassShootings #ChildrenBeforeGuns

4438 2018-05-18 22:50:45 @696_636  Got to keep up the narrative about semi automatic death weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. Wouldn't want someone to realize that every proposed gun control law short of a total ban wouldn't have stopped this senseless killing! #smh

4445 2018-05-18 22:45:42 Regulated and well managed gun shows. Comprehensive background checks. Disallow bump stocks. Armed and trained guards at schools and at public events. NRA can and should take the lead on meaningful regulation.

4451 2018-05-18 22:42:03 Semantics. At least he tried to do something. Didn’t Trump “promise” to ban bump stocks?

4455 2018-05-18 22:39:15 You are not worth listening to.  Trumps administration has made no meaningful efforts towards common sense gun laws.  Ban bump stocks.  Create and enforce universal background checks.  Ban assault weapons.  Do these things and we can talk.
4456 2018-05-18 22:39:10 Jim Cramer talking $AA and I remember when this stock used to trade at $9/share. Great turnaround story for this Aluminum producer. #Stocks

Slow down sparky and think a little.
4458 2018-05-18 22:38:35 Hehehe.. Joker..Bump stocks are limited to only a few semi-autos.. A large number of rifles don't need bump stocks. Still not a solution.
4459 2018-05-18 22:38:10 Somewhere out their on the internet superhighway there's been research on owning the stocks least owned by passive vehicles. Believe @philbak1 may have looked into it.
4460 2018-05-18 22:38:02 Say something once about the need for gun control and needed restrictions.  Don’t have to do everything at once but start with no bump stocks, mandatory background checks, no assault weapons and no high capacity magazines.
4461 2018-05-18 22:37:07 I had a journal when I traded penny stocks. Stopped when I got into crypto but you are pushing me towards doing it again.
4462 2018-05-18 22:36:46 You're naive. Tokens are penny stocks 2.0.
4463 2018-05-18 22:36:43 You can stop this evil by passing reasonable gun laws. Ban ARs and bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Have red flag laws to keep guns away from domestic abusers and the mentally ill. This isn’t rocket science #StopNRASponsoredTerrorism #GunReformNow

4483 2018-05-18 22:28:06 So in some cases it is malicious, in other cases it's just good for the country and also benefits them. To avoid this, politicians should have all stocks frozen or not be allowed to own stocks.
4484 2018-05-18 22:27:04 Yes but that’s just a play on words the main poll was on stocks so basically anything related, could even be the time involved in research which takes up over a day a week for me if not more.
4485 2018-05-18 22:26:41 Please back common sense gun control laws. Bump stocks were on midterm ballot & that's a good step. We also need age limits and a ban on assault rifles. No parent should outlive their child.

4490 2018-05-18 22:25:06 Hi ddobell. For vast majority of #uranium producers & developers with large #U3O8 assets, a higher US$ increases their profit margins & raises NAV for their company assets. That's because they are not in the US but sell #U3O8 in US$. Canadian & Aussie U stocks see largest gains.
4491 2018-05-18 22:24:55 @WallStreeTopGun Looks like FAANG stocks are pulled down today. Any reason behind? As per you mentioned couple of days ago that "they are make google below 1090 end of friday". How you are finding it?

4500 2018-05-18 22:17:31 Ban bump stocks, fortify background system, close gun show loophole, charge parents who leave guns around kids, or who give kids guns, ban ARs, register gun owners on an annual basis, etc.

4506 2018-05-18 22:14:47 Actually they, along with all MSNBC, CNN and other lib agencies should be in stocks for 90 days on B&W.
4507 2018-05-18 22:14:33 One of the first things I learned in “How to make money in stocks” by Bill o’Neil..I’m but a tiny fish
4508 2018-05-18 22:14:27 Nopeeeee Chris and I do all of our own investments and stocks are safer to most people but the more you learn the more you understand how safe cryptos are as well. Checkout my channel on videos explaining how to trade and get started. "CRYPTO TYTAN".

4512 2018-05-18 22:12:39 Do you need a stock broker to buy and sell crypto? Stocks are overall a safer investment over time but you gotta risk it for the biscuit
4513 2018-05-18 22:12:37 Right! Brands pay this girl to bring “stocks” for international and local artists. It’s disgusting
4514 2018-05-18 22:12:26 Before it was ban semi automatics and bump stocks. What now Mr Steyer? What would you do? #MoreRhetoric #NoSolutions
4515 2018-05-18 22:12:20 Strengthen background checks
Ban high capacity magazines
Ban bump stocks
Restrict “Assault Weapons”*
Promote SMART guns
”Safe Storage” laws

* “Assault Weapons” are really a sound bite, but semi-automatic rifles that are easily customizable.
4516 2018-05-18 22:11:21 No he fucking hasn’t . He banned bump stocks. That’s fucking it. It needs to be way more comprehensive than that and needs to go thru Congress so it’s a law and not an executive order. We have seen what happens to executive orders!!!!
4517 2018-05-18 22:11:19 Wrong. I literally could buy what I said, right now, from at least 6 people I personally know, including 2 that are private dealers.

And ask the victims of the Vegas massacre how much of a joke bump stocks are: you don't need to aim well in a corral.
4518 2018-05-18 22:11:16 Lol I'm not really into stocks im being sarcastic  There isn't enough gains to be made in stocks for my liking. You make way more in cryptos.
4519 2018-05-18 22:10:44 I recommend to invest in this project! Since this is the first virtual trading platform for stocks and cryptocurrencies based on their own AI engine. Don't miss a moment! #ico #redpillcoin #rpil #eth
4520 2018-05-18 22:10:42 There are already background checks. As for the assault weapons an AR 15 is NOT an assault  weapon. Ban bump stocks . They had ban on assault weapons years ago and it did zero. No easy answers. Banning all guns surely is not an answer.He also had explosives. He was out to kill.
4521 2018-05-18 22:10:27 @harryxnobl @Rowan_Stocks @Freddie_Sampson
4522 2018-05-18 22:10:24 Closing the gun show loophole, outlawing high capacity magazines and bump stocks, reinstating the assault weapons ban, these are things that @corygardner couldn’t have done if he wasn’t in the pocket of the NRA?
4523 2018-05-18 22:10:14 how about voting to save lives and stop supporting the NRA? maybe some common sense gun laws on bump stocks, background checks and waiting periods....?? how about THAT instead of prayers
4524 2018-05-18 22:09:49 I never thought I would see this day but here goes, the NRA is right AR-15 and bump stocks are not the problem. Somebody has got to get busy and do the research to figure out what we have done to young white men to make them so homicidal.
4525 2018-05-18 22:09:48 In a recent survey 89% of those using fixed odds machines thought they were addictive, well in a recent poll of mine 91% of Investors thought stocks were addictive in some form with 55% thinking they are very addictive or worse. 
So is share trading a richer mans gambling .
4526 2018-05-18 22:09:42 - A ban on bump stocks
- ban on military grade weapons being sold to civilians (there is genuinely no need for them) 
- proper background checks
4527 2018-05-18 22:09:28 Oh yes, moderate pressure to ban bump stocks has been SUPER helpful to this situation.

4530 2018-05-18 22:08:51 @jimcramer . Hey... Oil/gas prices and retail stocks strong this month.  Aren't they competing for same pocket?  Retail can't stay strong with rising oil prices, yes? Seems consumer absorbing and inflationary inputs well, for now.
4531 2018-05-18 22:08:28 I’ve sat down with my 3 daughters and given them a good talking to- the Prince stocks are running out- we are now gunna have to ride a few marriages out and hope for a divorce #RoyalWedding2018
4532 2018-05-18 22:08:14 The guns have gotten much more powerful, and kids copy other kids. In the 1930s, the U.S. banned the machine gun, which gangsters were using. But the "semi-automatic" guns are really machine guns in disguise, especially with bump stocks which make them automatic.
4533 2018-05-18 22:07:56 Serious question- have bump stocks been made illegal either from regulation or legislation?
4534 2018-05-18 22:07:34 Taxes due in April, so sell stocks in March to pay the bill.
4535 2018-05-18 22:06:53 There just now it’s like being in Heaven as there is a bar 100 yards away that stocks Highland water 
4536 2018-05-18 22:06:49 I think we need to change our laws a bit now honestly and I advocate for Gun Owners.  There are some people who shouldn't own/carry a gun.  I believe there should be reasonable limits to magazines put in place (10?), and bump stocks should be completely outlawed (IMO).
4537 2018-05-18 22:06:02 It's not really that simple. Almost nobody sells bump stocks because they're a joke item (you can't aim at all when using them), and both magazines and ammo have been in high demand for a while. You would be unlikely to have them all at private seller.
4538 2018-05-18 22:06:00 $ORPN  $2.10  not going any lower i guess! LOL  
I think this will play again next week! shorts need to cover! it's so cheap down here!! it was shorted heavily from $3.75
I will play the upcoming #squeeze
4539 2018-05-18 22:05:25 Unemployment lowest has been in years, people have more money to spend. Economy up...and dont tell me your stocks havent risen. Isis on the run, embassy now in Jerusalem...and still in negotiations with NK
4540 2018-05-18 22:05:16 @KAGoalkeeping Just moved to USA and they actually have an over 50’s league. My comeback between the stocks is on, how do I get some KA gloves over here.
4541 2018-05-18 22:05:03 Well we find out Trump is now buying stocks. Does it taken a Rocket Scientist to know that's  why he upset Wall St Markets? He's  a con n had lived his whole life ad 1. Wake the Hell up America. N he's  involved with his businesses with Foreign Powers. How much is enough?
4542 2018-05-18 22:04:48 Vlone stocks plummet once again

4544 2018-05-18 22:03:37 Its not against the law to do business in Moscow. Lets talk about how top dems own the largest amount of stocks in TWITTER and FB. Or how certain SENATORS have been robbing the American people for over 20 years ... well, just wait, you will see!
4545 2018-05-18 22:02:31 @RobEspino Hey I have some $SPRV stocks? Is there any news or reply you  got from them. Let me know pls.Thanks
4546 2018-05-18 22:02:30 My fiancé called from Federal & said “write this info down, you want to learn stocks, I got you a plug” 
4547 2018-05-18 22:01:08 So let's delve into this. The world record holder shot 27 rounds in approximately 4 seconds. That equals 405 rounds per minute, fired by a world record holder. Per WikiPedia, bump stocks allow an average person to fire between 400 - 800 rounds per minute.
4548 2018-05-18 22:00:24 Put them in the stocks. Let the public throw rotten food at them. Makes them sick. Public humiliation.
4549 2018-05-18 22:00:20 Victor chosed Felix as our number 1 keeper . Signed him and let Greene go , he won’t do the normal thing and sign Stocks, nothing in it for Victor . We are all wasting our time debating.
4550 2018-05-18 22:00:10 For the love of god, surely Faulkner starts at the point. Stocks should've learned her lesson about nonsense lineups last year.
4551 2018-05-18 22:00:03 A handful of patience is worth a bushel of brains - Dutch Proverb. #stocks #investing
4552 2018-05-18 21:59:30 My misconception on that its class is assault rifle but regardless they are still tools for murder not defense. Bump stocks are useless in that sense but that is what allows semi autos to become fully auto. And my previous statement remains assualt rifles still are not protected.
4553 2018-05-18 21:59:27 "...ban bump stocks, a device that can help semiautomatic weapons fire like machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas massacre in October."  It's amazing how the LAS event has disappeared without any details.
4554 2018-05-18 21:59:11 Now Trump's in a bind with his NRA cronies since after this shooting he can't lie about "banning bump stocks" like after the Florida AR-15 massacre. I suppose he'll rely on his speech writer (Nazi Stephen Miller) to lie his way out of this one and still appear to be sympathetic!!
4555 2018-05-18 21:58:27 I can imagine the TSX jumping 10% in a short order - Good bank results, idiots selling the dividend payers stop selling, investors remember that we are all addicted to our phones and oil stocks really price in $70 oil. I can only dream
4556 2018-05-18 21:58:16 A quand les nouveaux stocks de casquettes sur @UnicornWal ? @PowA_VodK
4557 2018-05-18 21:58:07 Ottawa Crew beats New Brunswick crews. Space on fire, takes 6 stocks, @BkrYonKs takes 5. Let's go 613!!! P.S. @InfamousKeith I love you. #GOML #Goml2018 #esports #TeamIG
4558 2018-05-18 21:56:57 Last I checked big corps are spending repatriated money to buy back stocks, pay special dividends and improve exec comp ! Oh that is right , these are the people you are being sponsored by !
4559 2018-05-18 21:56:50 So... If there weren't any
1) Signs
2) Priors
3) History of Mental Illness
4) Automatic Weapons
5) Bump Stocks
and this is not unique...
Then what could be to blame?

4560 2018-05-18 21:56:10 Anyone trade stocks here?
4561 2018-05-18 21:55:40 Hii Story ya corruption haita Isha. Kenya has been, yaani with a switch it stops? Pulease!?! Not sure if stocks get affected based on conversation.
4562 2018-05-18 21:55:22 Ar in AR15 stands for armalite which is the first company that made that weapon. Bump stocks are still technically semi automatic because your finger is still hitting the trigger every time. They have literally no use.
4563 2018-05-18 21:54:09 my stocks going up on the friday before a long weekend? how beautiful.
4564 2018-05-18 21:54:03 Ah, gotcha. I just remember PIPM rating this past season really highly. That's about where I am on him, although I like the length and consistent stocks% production. Just a matter of whether he can shoot and figure out that passing is beneficial.
4565 2018-05-18 21:53:02 @timothysykes my first winning trade today. Very small position with $13 gain on $RNN. Entry 2.22 exit 2.35. My first ever trades haven't been too good but even if my small account isn't growing yet my knowledge account is. Must enter more volatile stocks!!!! 
4566 2018-05-18 21:52:28 my strategy today is im gonna ask for the display if they dont have any stocks left

i gotta have what i wanna have
4567 2018-05-18 21:51:39 Bump stocks haven’t been used in a school shooting, ar-15 have. He’s also pocketed more money from the NRA than any other president.
4568 2018-05-18 21:51:37 There are conflict of interest laws and ethical norms ... if you want to serve the public then requiring that (at a minimum) previously owned stocks be put in a blind trust is perfectly reasonable. There should be no room for self-dealing when entrusted with the public interest.
4569 2018-05-18 21:51:20 It’s an absolute momentum strategy on US stocks, but also All Cap and highly-concentrated (less than 20 names), so I think once over $50-100MM it would become a lot harder to own small/micro cap positions, but that would certainly be a nice problem to have.
4570 2018-05-18 21:51:18 Rob: with all due respect you’re still wet behind the ears. I made my money in property a long long time ago (real money none of the make believe stuff you post) and now i invest in growth stocks as a hobby: this year I guarantee I’ve made more than your salary. So thanks but...
4571 2018-05-18 21:50:55 IF THIS IS SO, HE USES IT FOR PERSONAL USE.  REMEMBER, HE TAKES NO SALARY. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL A TRUST. AND, HE DID SALE ENORMOUS STOCKS & PLACE THEM IN TRUST, BEFORE HE WAS SWORN IN.  IT WAS ALL OVER THE NET.
4572 2018-05-18 21:50:50 See you Sunday!
4573 2018-05-18 21:50:42 And it's like it was just yesterday that you were discussing my local rep's desire to ban guns because of muzzle velocity and because of folding stocks and scopes...
4574 2018-05-18 21:50:17 Better and more thorough background checks, banning high capacity magazines and bump stocks, limiting people with mental disorders from buying guns, removing guns from people with a history of domestic violence, etc. All of these are opposed by the NRA. Try Googling this.
4575 2018-05-18 21:50:15 Not quite ar-15 semi automatics most certainly can be purchased but bump stocks turn it automatic and its in its name assault rifle-15. The grenade launcher remark was from another discussion my bad. Lastly look at the specs of AR' their design is meant for slaughter not defense.
4576 2018-05-18 21:50:05 Thanks for asking. Here’s the plan: 1) Implement universal background checks. No loopholes. Not one. 2) Ban military-style assault weapons. These are weapons of war that have no place in the hands of civilians. 3) Ban bump stocks so weapons can’t be made deadlier.

Let me blow your mind, the Las Vegas shooting would have been much more deadly with your remington bolt action.
Be glad that that shit head used bump stocks, do you have an idead of angles and distance?
4579 2018-05-18 21:47:31 2) Ban bump stocks.

4581 2018-05-18 21:47:01 I’m finna get into stocks
4582 2018-05-18 21:46:42 Close private gun sale loopholes, need to be 21 to purchase a firearm, ban bump stocks, mental health checks, more resource officers near or in schools, do not arm teachers, require firearm safety training, increase background checks.
4583 2018-05-18 21:45:22 checks, closing the loophole for abusive individuals, raising the age to buy weapons, banning semi-automatic assault rifles & bump stocks +
4584 2018-05-18 21:45:03 I'd like to see a ban on bump stocks for starters, improved inter-agency data sharing, stricter legislation re: gun ownership for domestic abusers, and improved services for the mentally ill. I'm tracking my state law makers and will make this a voting issue in November.
4585 2018-05-18 21:44:35 Hard to get that these days! I don't think Ohio stocks it so you gotta ask. to get  them to order
4586 2018-05-18 21:43:46 My working strategy right now is stocks that tank on Trump-related tweets (IE: $amzn, $baba, $eem, and $fxi) I tend to purchase long positions and subsidize those trades trades with straddles. $djia $spy $spx
4587 2018-05-18 21:42:53 Strict background checks.
Ban bump stocks.
No guns to domestic abusers.

4599 2018-05-18 21:33:42 Can we pass background checks on all gun sales? Can we enact Red Flag Laws to temporarily remove guns from a person who is a threat to themselves or others?  Can we prohibit high capacity magazines? Can we prohibit Bump stocks? #CommonSenseGunReform @MomsDemand

4617 2018-05-18 21:26:23 Dear neighbours to the south. You really need to review your gun laws. I realize that it takes people to operate the gun to commit mass murders but I can guarantee if AR15s with Buck Stocks were illegal mass casualty shootings would be down. This is senseless
4618 2018-05-18 21:26:01 The same way you can get ar-15s, bump stocks and large capacity magazines, you can get plans for IEDs online. It's eaiser to get the former than latter.

The end result is the same: mass carnage. The difference is the GOP/NRA condones the former.
4619 2018-05-18 21:25:42 Name an instance where a private sale resulted in a mass shooting. You obviously don't know what you are talking about regarding weapons. I so agree " bump stocks" should be outlawed, but they can be made. We need to protect our children.

4621 2018-05-18 21:24:21 As the week comes to a close, Mortgage Bonds holding gains. Stocks mixed. 10-yr yield 3.06%.
4622 2018-05-18 21:24:10 Stocks lower: US & Europe -.3%. Markets weighed political & trade uncertainty heavier than solid economy and earnings today. Next week will show more volatility as trade issues will continue to grow. No reason yet for concern for longer-term investors.
4623 2018-05-18 21:23:23 No it relaxes you after a long day at work. I think after she said that she looked at her pharma stocks.
4624 2018-05-18 21:23:03 Stocks rising baby
4625 2018-05-18 21:22:32 Funny how all their stocks went up after his speech, isn’t it?
4626 2018-05-18 21:22:31 My guy, it’d be the same type of gun except, they’d replace the stocks 
4627 2018-05-18 21:20:35 #cryptocurency is the better choice for now stocks are about to get slammed.
4628 2018-05-18 21:19:34 I do believe bump stocks have already been outlawed after the Vegas shooting but it could still be pushing through Congress I’m not sure, but a ban isn’t the answer. It boils down to parents monitoring their kids and schools having armed staff. IMO.
4629 2018-05-18 21:19:05 haha still around. not focusing too much on stocks right now. 

crypto time
4630 2018-05-18 21:18:49 Haven't heard of it, thanks!
4631 2018-05-18 21:17:45 He meant their sacrifice helped bring more profit to his stocks in arms-manufacturers and he was able to buy a new addition for his house.
4632 2018-05-18 21:17:42 So the moment it’s bought/ sold at greater than $100 (like the painting for $21 million) that’s what every one of your USICoin will be worth. It’s like being creative and getting paid in stocks, which is important for a career with little job security...Music.
4633 2018-05-18 21:17:26 So it is sensible to have bump stocks, 1000 rounds,20 guns and no background checks at gun shows?
4634 2018-05-18 21:17:23 Another school shooting!! Our children aren't safe anywhere. The mall, movies,school etc. When are we going to stand up and say enough is enough. We need better gun laws, background checks and to make bump stocks and large magazines illegal! I am so sorry for the losses.
4635 2018-05-18 21:17:18 Boeing stocks are going 
4636 2018-05-18 21:15:41 Yes, let's NOT DISCUSS having mental health options, especially for troubled teens. Let's NOT DISCUSS gun laws, like background checks or banning AR-15's, banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Let's NOT discuss actual solutions. Let's talk about doors and coats...sigh.

4641 2018-05-18 21:13:07 Please tell me how banning bump stocks would have stopped today tragedy? The answer is it wouldn't have and only punished legal gun owners #FDT
4642 2018-05-18 21:12:36 Lololol I truly think they will. There’s too much at risk to lose if they don’t lol. Their stocks and the amount of money lost due to profits would be a total financial disaster business wise (this is my mother base economics degree paying off lol)

4644 2018-05-18 21:12:17 The AAP recommends: Universal mandatory background checks with mental health reporting; Ban high velocity "assault" type rifles; limit magazines to less than 10 bullets; ban bump stocks; age over 21; require training, license and registration.
4645 2018-05-18 21:12:07 This is bad that young people do not own stocks.

Not to mention that companies have been inflating stock prices and spending billions of dollars on #stock #buybacks.

Since 1979, companies have stopped raising wages, but have been buying back their own stock. We need to invest.
4646 2018-05-18 21:09:58 What about pharma stocks since then? Judging the stock market by a few hours of performance is total stupidity. Good thing you're not an investor handling my money. Oh wait, you want to handle ALL of our tax dollars...
4647 2018-05-18 21:09:21 Point me at the NRA member who is joining any discussion or pushing any person in congress or the senate towards a way to prevent this from happening? The NRA doesn’t even want bump stocks banned!!?? Why?
4648 2018-05-18 21:09:02 We can start with not allowing military style weapons to be made available to civilians or banning things like bump stocks that have no purpose other than to increase the rate of fire on a fire arm
4649 2018-05-18 21:09:01 I know. No sympathies for growth stocks if you don’t give Perfect ER everywhere. -10% is overkill
4650 2018-05-18 21:08:50 Another round of bullshit about bump stocks in 3..2..1
4651 2018-05-18 21:08:49 Ok then if you aware of all these than the price of commodities should go up & not down from the monetary point of view, but taking into consideration oil stocks, rising production, Iran’s discounted price sale of oil to China it can go down. Therefore all depends on EIA reports
4652 2018-05-18 21:08:33 Where do i find your disclosure of stocks held?
4653 2018-05-18 21:07:07 suddenly apple has stocks on time.
4654 2018-05-18 21:05:47 Except banning the military-Esque guns that allow for so many people to be shot so quickly. And closing the gun show loophole. And raising the legal age for gun purchases. And banning bump stocks. And strengthening background checks.

4666 2018-05-18 21:02:56 Tx Karin, several stocks similar & it all adds up. Why is it not viable for small investors to claim back? Plse to explain us the process to do so.
4667 2018-05-18 21:02:53 Practical approach considering the possibility of copy cats.  There can be mass murder without assault rifles , extended magazines, and bump stocks.  But they would occur farther apart and fewer between without them.  Good people of America don't want to enfringe on the 2nd A.

4687 2018-05-18 20:52:32 I appreciate your civility.  SOME regulations will lead to more regulations (always) and then confiscation.  You know what happens when the populace is unarmed.  I do believe, however, that bump stocks have no place here.  That is already outlawed though.
4688 2018-05-18 20:52:18 Hard limits on things like clip size, storage (like we have in the uk), weapon type, and accessories (bump stocks). All sensible, proportionate ideas. As a country, you need to seriously reflect and consider why your gun crime is off the charts higher than everybody else.
4689 2018-05-18 20:51:43 John and @FootnotesFirst, any thoughts if the USD keeps ripping higher and suppression of U stocks?
4690 2018-05-18 20:50:56 I can agree on background checks, banning bump stocks, changing the age for a semi auto weapon to 21, and taking guns from Violent Felons (keyword Violent) but I can not support banning a gun!
4691 2018-05-18 20:49:53 Are u trading stocks or options?
4692 2018-05-18 20:48:07 How much is a penny worth? It depends on who you are...

If you trade your time for money, every penny on your check is worth $.01, right? 

If you make your money work for you by trading stocks, every penny is worth MULTIPLE $$$, depending on how many shares you control.

4693 2018-05-18 20:47:45 God, this country is so f up! David, know I have always voted for dems that at least are trying to help.  Maybe with a change (hopefully VERY soon), we can at least start with the bump stocks. And asshole parents that don't lock guns up. soon, I the NRA should be a terror group.
4694 2018-05-18 20:47:17 And you can’t even ban bump stocks
NRA rules — eh ?
4695 2018-05-18 20:47:07 Illuminate one proposed gun control measure that could have prevented THIS event....
-ban assault-style weapons 
-raise age to purchase a rifle 
-close gun show loophole
-longer waiting period
-ban bump stocks 
The problem is - this type of shooting requires a different paradigm
4696 2018-05-18 20:46:02 They should bring back the stocks in public and you should just be allowed to torture them however you want without killing them. 24/7.
4697 2018-05-18 20:45:40 Very true.

Same with low volatility stocks.
4698 2018-05-18 20:45:18 1. Background checks complied with...kid stole his father's gun.
2. Bump stocks ARE being banned, but weren't used.
3. AR-15 wasn't used. 
4. Shooter was underage...already illegal. 
5. Not on watch list.
So...ALL of your suggestions would have accomplished NOTHING. 

Next?

4700 2018-05-18 20:44:47 The bid/offer spreads of mic cap AIM stocks cost much more than 0.5%. Thanks for reminding me this. Just cancelled my £EMR limit order, which didn’t fill for a week @ 78p while the price had been 78/82p for a long while!
4701 2018-05-18 20:44:41 If you've followed me for 6 years (about 5000 of you), you know I used to also maintain, outside ES futures, a retirement port made up of stocks (and a little market timing w SSO).

4703 2018-05-18 20:44:12 And you right wingers automatically think they want to take your guns away! Tell me what’s wrong with mandatory gun safes and mandatory training and education for every gun owner? Why do we need bump stocks? Why can’t we have more thorough background checks? Please explain?
4704 2018-05-18 20:44:05 Can you take a picture please? Where was it stored? With the other stocks or with foreign ingredients?

4706 2018-05-18 20:42:28 Lots of volume in gun stocks today eh there tommy?
4707 2018-05-18 20:42:22 I will gladly answer your question and hope you will do the same. My answer: Bump stocks- not in favor of those. 100 round mag- unnecessary and too heavy but whatever. Carrying in public- CCW holders. Not a fan of open carry. BG checks for ammo unnecessary, had it already.
4708 2018-05-18 20:42:22 So tell me again how they have nothing to do with this?? Obama set forth a plan to have mental disorders placed on the background checks. Trump took it away for the NRA, there were talks of banning bump stocks, it was blocked by guess who?? The NRA.
4709 2018-05-18 20:42:10 Tough to call it especially w such a narrow chart and exactly why I only grabbed 1/4 of a normal sized position here. GL!

4715 2018-05-18 20:40:51 Why do you think that it is so easy for someone with mental illness to get a gun?? Because the NRA will not allow better gun control! They threw a fit about banning bump stocks?? Along with lining the pockets of Washington so that laws don’t change!

4720 2018-05-18 20:39:38 ...you offered two alternatives to bump stocks, so I'm only asking about how close of alternatives they are.
4721 2018-05-18 20:39:05 I would like to see all gun owners have to pass a written and practical safety  test, similar to getting a drivers license. 
We need to ban semi auto weapons and bump stocks.
4722 2018-05-18 20:35:56 shorting groups attack good stocks with good companies daily and continuously like a cancer, financials go completely by the wayside,  complete RIPOFF and horrible for their employees and investors, get the SEC off their butts and go after these people, it is FRAUD
4723 2018-05-18 20:35:49 Why not just short the sheets on the mattresses? Much lower risk, albeit perhaps less sexy.

Everyone is on about the stocks. . .
4724 2018-05-18 20:35:40 My apologies, I was talking specifically about the North Hollywood Shootout.

Bump stocks does not make a semi-auto a full-auto. It literally just forces your finger to pull the trigger faster than normal. It mechanically is not the same as full-auto mechanisms.
4725 2018-05-18 20:34:22 Crypto and Stocks is not for the faint of heart.  I already know heads get antsy when you see that money dropping.
4726 2018-05-18 20:33:48 Bernie I support you and will vote for you for POTUS but no rifles or “assault” weapons were used in this one. Can’t blame #NRA Can’t blame AR-15s can’t blame bump stocks. Maybe just have to fix mental health and broken families.
4727 2018-05-18 20:33:38 We are specifically talking about the options similar to bump stocks though.
4728 2018-05-18 20:33:23 It's amazing that we wrote this 20 years, and still almost nobody deducts future stock option grants from DCF cash flows, or subtracts the "economic liability" of outstanding stock options when valuing stocks. We did some good work together. Was nice to see you.
4729 2018-05-18 20:32:51 You should know that better than me. The only things I have an issue with is the AR-15 with the extended clip and bump stocks. I don't think that is unreasonable. More unreasonable is that the age limit for that gun is 18. Scary.
4730 2018-05-18 20:32:50 He’s certainly working on it. He’s outlawing bump stocks which is more than any president has done in recent history regarding gun laws. We also need to figure out how we’re failing this generation that they treat each other so horribly and resort to killing one another.
4731 2018-05-18 20:31:35 A liberal nor a conservative should be mad about that since bump stocks just help with a technique. You can use your belt and achieve the same results.
4732 2018-05-18 20:31:30 I must be missing your point, Dan. The original topic had zero to do with bump stocks. I'm happy without them. I agree with your thinking on why guns were created. Had zero to do with kids with mental imbalances shooting other kids.
4733 2018-05-18 20:31:16 Sending a tweet is a lot quicker than learning how to trade stocks online lol. I don't get how you can't understand that people's circumstances differ which may mean they are not able to earn a lot of money not due to "laziness"
4734 2018-05-18 20:31:07 Hey everyone who was on board today are there any chat-room recommendations that anyone has for penny stocks, triple zero penny stocks and double zero penny stocks?  #pennystocks #pennystock #subzerostocks #triplezeropennystocks #triplezerostocks #tripzeropennystocks
4735 2018-05-18 20:30:52 It’s never easy and most only ever see a twitter feed and not the real hard graft that goes on. AIM isn’t a punt it’s very real. Research and entry points into stocks is the biggest protection against minimising losses and maximising gains everything else is just noise
4736 2018-05-18 20:30:11 Oil, like stocks, tends to go up over time, then it corrects violently. 2000, 2008, 2014... the appear to have a symbiotic relationship. 2018 next? #WTI
4737 2018-05-18 20:29:32 If only you bought stocks in Ocado just like you did Amazon *allegedly*
4738 2018-05-18 20:29:14 Oh no! And like no one stocks those adaptors!
4739 2018-05-18 20:28:15 It’s cool. I trust these idiots to resolve the trade disputes next week. 
The calm will suppress bond yields & revitalize confidence in stocks. 

Hopefully.
Lol.
4740 2018-05-18 20:27:14 Forgot about that one.  It sure what would have stopped that sensible gun laws? Would that have stopped it or did he have those bump stocks?
4741 2018-05-18 20:27:08 Whoa

This is like funding podcasts by shorting traditional mattress stocks.
4742 2018-05-18 20:27:02 The woman in question has two children, presumably she can't afford to risk what little money she has on stocks with literally zero knowledge of them whilst having two children to feed. Circumstances matter
4743 2018-05-18 20:25:48 I'm just gonna use crypto to buy energy stocks and fold my returns back into more crypto.

* End the sale of assault-style weapons, large capacity magazines and bump stocks.

4745 2018-05-18 20:25:31 Great question! Paddock bought his legally and caused more carnage then all the rest. I think banning bump stocks is a start, a registry, an updated database for background checks and gun safety training...think of it like earning the right to drive. It works in Canada.
4746 2018-05-18 20:24:54 So are you wanting to ban .223/5.56 caliber rifles? Because that is the only thing they have in common with the M16 that matters. Pistol grips, fore grips, adjustable stocks, the main attributes of "assault weapons" doesn't make a gun deadlier

4749 2018-05-18 20:23:13 Drug Stocks Went Up^! Trump is not going to lower drug cost, just talk about it. 
This is Midterm Talk
4750 2018-05-18 20:23:09 Nope. I didn’t know it was a scam. I fell into the hype, then after I got enough facts and numbers, I bailed out and tried to warn others. I didn’t know crap about penny stocks back then
4751 2018-05-18 20:23:04 NRA bullying will not stop us.  We will also push for universal background checks and a ban on weapons of war and bump stocks.  #ncpol @GraigMeyer @CecilBrockman @FloydMcKissick @JeffJacksonNC @jay_chaudhuri
4752 2018-05-18 20:22:51 Banned bump stocks
Florida bill passed (Rubio not Trump)
Met with Kyle in person to talk about school safety
Until congress gives him a bill to sign into law, exactly what do you want him to do about this?
4753 2018-05-18 20:22:05 I would go long energy(oil&ngas) sector stocks
4754 2018-05-18 20:22:00 Pas grave .. t’en mettras 2 la prochaine fois ..pour que tes stocks soient justes ..
4755 2018-05-18 20:21:54 Sep/Oct... worst months of the year for stocks and pre #Midterms. Still need to get to those ATHs first.
4756 2018-05-18 20:21:19 Oh, i very much agree with the sentiment. But, i'm more inclined to believe that stocks, rotten tomatoes and cabbages, in the town square, would have a longer lasting effect.
4757 2018-05-18 20:20:33 Beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder. Make your garden a multi-sensual experience--plant mock orange, viburnum, roses, lilacs, jasmine, and stocks,
4758 2018-05-18 20:20:15 Yes Democratic Congress ban on assault guns and large bullet capacity cartridges, bump stocks  and a crying towel for Oliver, you know the contra affair Guy.....Stone.
4759 2018-05-18 20:19:22 I bet she hasn’t tried to learn to invest in stocks or cryptos or even attempted to do a basic amazon or eBay business. I’ll bet money on it
4760 2018-05-18 20:18:56 Will you also vote to ban fertilizer? Rental vans? Airplanes? Knives? Machetes? ALL bomb making materials? People who have severe mental problems? Drugs? Ban on ALL who illegally bring drugs into our country? How about a ban on President Obama for bump stocks- fast and furious?
4761 2018-05-18 20:17:37 Lets give all kids 15 and over a hand gun. The NRA will love that. Gun stocks will soar. Let the old west shootouts solve issues.
4762 2018-05-18 20:17:18 Why are the stocks up then lmao 
4763 2018-05-18 20:17:13 Universal background checks.
Mental health background checks.
Ban assault weapons, high capacity clips and bump stocks.
Hold parents criminally responsible for their children’s actions, if the child commits a crime with the parent’s unsecured gun.
4764 2018-05-18 20:16:51 YES! Strict Gun Laws. The only answer. Confiscate all Assault weapons. AR-15s & the like, High capacity clips, bump stocks... all that mass murder shit. Make it a crime not to turn them in. Like Australia did. Fill our jails with gun crazies instead of non-violent drug users.
4765 2018-05-18 20:16:24 @ntengler Nancy you were too hilarious today on @CNBC's Closing Bell! Love your thought to stay consistent on small/mid cap stocks but not be overweight. #401k
4766 2018-05-18 20:16:17 Yes.  Bump stocks themselves take practice to master, it's just slightly easier than bump firing without it.
4767 2018-05-18 20:15:46 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
4768 2018-05-18 20:15:44 Roughly $390 million have flowed into ETFs that specifically exclude gun stocks since Parkland. Skeptics may shrug, but that's more than have flowed into marijuana ETFs, blockchain ETFs and the MAGA ETF over the same period--combined. 

Much more.
4769 2018-05-18 20:15:34 Mutual funds aren't as exciting as stocks. Boring may be a good description. Still, is the point excitement or success? Not all investment tools are glamorous, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored.

4773 2018-05-18 20:14:17 I am all for background checks, banning bump stocks, and changing the age for a Semi auto gun to 21. And banning a violent felon (keyword violent) from owning a gun and domestic violence people from owning a gun. But I will not support banning a gun! Because it’s not the issue!
4774 2018-05-18 20:14:16 Correct..  Those ETFs you're mentioning. similar to XLI.   have just a handful of stocks carrying them, which are huge disproportional weights -   Strip $AMZN, $CMG $NFLX, $HD out of Discretionary and tell me how we're doing the last 12 mths

4777 2018-05-18 20:13:24 Yuuuuup. Clearly they aren’t empathizing. They aren’t caring to see the aftermath, they’re looking at stocks and NRA campaign promises. Something has to finally hit home and I sincerely hope such a drastic wake up call isn’t necessary

4779 2018-05-18 20:13:13 $MGM strength on a pullback day for gaming stocks! Good to see! I'm surprised the news about sports betting hasn't pushed the stock back up to the pre-earnings price.

4789 2018-05-18 20:09:27 Stocks WERE up during Obama. Unemployment WAS down under Obama.  Economy  DID recover from Bush's disaster. Obama DID respect the military and  offered to put money behind it, only to have Congress say no.  And now Trump - a President I wouldnt leave with my wife or daughter.

4793 2018-05-18 20:07:49 Then DO SOMETHING - compel Congress to back complete background checks, ban bump stocks, silencers, cop killer rounds, super shooter magazines!
4794 2018-05-18 20:07:00 These mass shooters are not insane, black or immigrants. They are home grown and filled with hate which you fuel.  The only way to stop this: ban assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Require thorough background checks and licensing. Close gun show loopholes.
4795 2018-05-18 20:06:58 If you closed the day/week/month/year green and don't wire money out of your account did you really make anything? #Stocks #Futures #BeerMoney
4796 2018-05-18 20:06:47 And bump stocks need to go, which they are. If you want an automatic weapon you can go through the crazy federal process and spend your $10k.
4797 2018-05-18 20:06:14 Let us do the praying. Get off your butt, tell the NRA to take a hike & do something! Outlaw bump stocks, tougher background checks or outlaw large capacity magazines. Something! Not every law will fit every situation but at least appear somewhat interested.

4800 2018-05-18 20:05:12 Basically, what the Parkland kids have been agitating for:
-Universal background checks
-Red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers, people with histories of criminal violence, and people who've made credible threats
-Ban on bump stocks, high-capacity mags, & semis
4801 2018-05-18 20:05:11 The Pacific Salmon Foundation (PSF) is calling for an end to open-water salmon aquaculture, in the wake of new research linking a virus found in Atlantic salmon to weakened Pacific salmon stocks.
4802 2018-05-18 20:04:58 No more bump stocks, silencers, cop killer rounds, super shooter magazines, complete background checks for all gun sales. 
Act to save lives, not ask for NRA dollars. Those dollars are tainted!
4803 2018-05-18 20:04:57 It’s long past time, Adam. The @NRA, @waynelapierrejr and @DLoesch must go. The entire gun industry needs better controls over their product and ancillary add-ons; bump stocks, excessive clips, etc. too many children are dying and those ppl could give a shit!!!
4804 2018-05-18 20:04:54 Ended the week with some #stocks up and some down. Part of the game. #Stocks #investing
4805 2018-05-18 20:04:36 Stocks high bc valued in dollars and £ low. Ditto inward investment.

4807 2018-05-18 20:03:35 Tfw my stocks are up 
4808 2018-05-18 20:02:37 Try another approach.  How about adopting VERY strict gun ownership reform laws; banning automatic and/or semi-automatic guns and bump stocks.  Your vapid thoughts and prayers are not changing a thing nor saving any lives. #Votechange

4811 2018-05-18 19:59:57 Umm Trump doesn’t make law. He enacts Bills passed by the House and Senate. So it’s actually Congress that has failed since Trump has already banned bump stocks and other devices that mimic auto-fire weapons. He can’t unilaterally do anything about guns. So, talk to Congress.
4812 2018-05-18 19:59:51 There's obviously a strong case for owning physical gold, given that its supply could easily vanish in a crisis, and one would have one's gold position involuntarily closed out at a low dollar value. But a decent argument for investing in the others through ETFs/mining stocks?
4813 2018-05-18 19:59:38 Each year the market destroys a new investor rule of thumb. This year is that “dividend stocks are safe”

4815 2018-05-18 19:58:32 Peaks and lows don't coincide with stable market conditions. Under normal circumstances you expect a store of value to have the same value coming out as it did going in. You expect minimal volatility. Crypto is highly volatile. It is no more a store of value than weed stocks.
4816 2018-05-18 19:58:09 Another dumb moron, banning of bump stocks was passed during Obama, and then Republican controlled the House.. Hence NRA held them to their guts again. #FightIgnorance
4817 2018-05-18 19:57:22 Pick your favorite (public) weed company and buy some stocks
4818 2018-05-18 19:57:04 I am interested in fixing the problem by working to solve 1) Dysfunctional families, 2) Harden schools like we do other other super secure facilities, 3) Stop ignoring mental illness, 4) Fix gun regs that need fixing (bump stocks, loose regs, etc.), 4) School bullying crisis.
4819 2018-05-18 19:56:52 You said you would "write out" the bump stocks. Last I heard you turned this over to Sessions after NRA visited you. Has the Fed govt. done anything remotely close to resolving these school shootings. Now who is afraid of the NRA?
4820 2018-05-18 19:56:47 I agree.  I would like to see a ban on ar-15 type guns and bump stocks. We have hunting rifles in the house. As far as the NRA, I think they have stayed far from the original intent of the organization. They are a gun manufacturer lobby now,using fear tactics as a sales pitch.
4821 2018-05-18 19:56:38 Thanks, I only follow a handful of stocks each day, and M wasn't one of them today. But I was interested in AMAT short, just no spot for me.

4823 2018-05-18 19:55:31 At least one city in Colorado has banned assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines.  Granted, the NRA already said it's going to sue, but it's a start.
4824 2018-05-18 19:55:24 Very happy @Bourdain's recent show on Newfoundland touched on conservation of cod and fish stocks, but surprised they didn't comment on the episode's seemingly inexhaustible supply of burly, bearded, and handsome Canadian men.
4825 2018-05-18 19:55:14 Oh my, he gave his entire quarterly salary to the VA.  All $100,000 toward a proposed budget of $200 billion?  That’s a bandaid for a bullet wound.

4833 2018-05-18 19:51:54 How sad.We need to be able to STUDY this violence thru the CDC. These patterns are predictable! Ban guns from mentally ill individuals. Parents need to LOCK up guns if they buy them like this shooter's mother. We need to ban bump stocks. We need to PLACE LIVES OVER GUNS.
4834 2018-05-18 19:51:54 Also, they are such a good seller because they have been called the "lego of the weapon world." Dipshits like you put tactical scopes, collapsible stocks, laser sights...it all stems from your small penis and 'hero complex.' You don't NEED an AR-15.

4837 2018-05-18 19:50:51 Yes, exactly, let's enfoce the current laws and punish the people who aren't holding up their end of the bargain.  I don't think bump stocks made a difference at all, but ymmv.  A quick trigger finger or bump firing without the stock is the exact same thing
4838 2018-05-18 19:50:31 I mean everyone knows that they’ve already taken away bump stocks but good luck lmao pawn shops will sell you anything.
4839 2018-05-18 19:50:19 Look at Vegas - it's not just kids. I'm cool with a rifle for hunting or a pistol for protection, but enough with the Rambo looking guns and bump stocks. No citizen needs a gun like that. Common sense laws will make it harder and result in less death. Isn't that a good thing?
4840 2018-05-18 19:50:02 Boulder Colorado's passing a law to ban assault rifles & bump stocks...
Effective now.
Cities can pass these laws...
WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP?!!
4841 2018-05-18 19:49:39 Fine dude, go ahead and pass stricter background checks, ban bump stocks, AR-15s.......it won't stop this from happening
4842 2018-05-18 19:49:25 of course he was.... Who got bump stocks banned in 1st year? Trump
4843 2018-05-18 19:49:18 There are types of weapons that normal citizens cannot own. Assault weapons being one of those. 

Making bump stocks and large capacity magazines illegal would be a smart thing too, but who knows if that will ever happen.
4844 2018-05-18 19:48:38 Agreed and BBC interviewers should routinely ask for & display on screen (if TV) a CoI for all contributors. CNBC displays this for people talking about stocks. Should be a condition for  contributed content in all media outlets. No declaration - no contribution.

4849 2018-05-18 19:47:29 Trump took executive action to ban bump stocks. Obama did not. Trump had a round table with victims from Broward shooting. The issue is not the NRA, the issue is our unabated mental health crisis. LN, UK shows mass violence occurring in spite of strict gun laws.

4853 2018-05-18 19:44:30 To be fair many fund managers also loaded some stocks which gained 2X +.

That's why they build a portfolio and what matters is the long term performance of that portfolio where many diversified funds have given 15-20% CAGR over 15+ yrs!

Not enough to be considered 'smart'?

4855 2018-05-18 19:44:04 None of the suggestions you list would have stopped this. Bump stocks, already being banned. He used a shotgun. He had a handgun also which requires age 21. Background checks are useless against a 17 yr old. Already laws preventing mentally ill from owning a gun.

4867 2018-05-18 19:40:23 He's a socialist living off presumably inherited wealth which he has invested in a portfolio of stocks and bonds, what could possibly be confusing about that
4868 2018-05-18 19:40:14 Lol, Sutherland Springs should not have been able to legally purchase a gun...Parkland should have been committed for psychiatric evaluation and guns confiscated...Vegas should lead to bump stocks being legislated against...so you have Pulse left.
4869 2018-05-18 19:40:04 Small cap low float stocks are hot

4870 2018-05-18 19:39:55 For example. I'd love to ban bump stocks. However, you can accomplish the same thing with a piece of string. We can't ban string.
4871 2018-05-18 19:39:41 Metal detectors at school entrances plus armed security, close off others, video monitoring by security firm. Anyone seeking gun license mental health check, & full background check, link database at ATF w/state, local, & FBI, no bump stocks. That would stop 99.9% of this

4877 2018-05-18 19:36:14 Mandatory background checks, no ar 15s. 21 year old requirements, and I think insurance requirements, and child safety laws. Common sense laws.  And domestic abuse era should not be allowed to own a gun.  No bump stocks.

4882 2018-05-18 19:34:49 Thanks for sharing. One of my brokers - Nordnet Bank - has not activated the new ticker yet - so I am stuck with a good chunk of stocks. They claim it is their clearing bank that is late. My other broker - Saxo Bank - had $SESN up and running at open yesterday!
4883 2018-05-18 19:34:44 Babes stocks only going up from here ..
4884 2018-05-18 19:34:41 Please show some leadership here Doug, and pressure your friends on the other side of the aisle (including Sen. Shelby) to take some reasonable steps forward on gun safety. As other folks say, you can ban bump stocks and high capacity clips, universal background checks, etc.
4885 2018-05-18 19:33:56 I’m into trying absolutely anything to get better & yep I’ll clear all stocks if it continues to give just an ounce of improvement 
4886 2018-05-18 19:33:52 It's hard to get everything in a few tweets, but I'll try...

First, there needs to be a department that classifies each weapon, both from the past and those being designed today so gun manufacturers can't just find a way around the regulations, like with bump stocks.
4887 2018-05-18 19:33:44 #orpol @OregonGovBrown calls on U.S. Congress to ban assault-style weapons and bump stocks and raise age to buy firearms to 21.

4889 2018-05-18 19:32:47 @TradingKingEric would you consider giving alerts on higher priced stocks? Something to hold for longer than a few days :)
4890 2018-05-18 19:32:02 But they banned Bump Stocks.
4891 2018-05-18 19:31:52 Investment advice 

Stock Exchange: Go Index and Sector funds. You may get lucky with individual stocks but indexing is the safest and soundest way.

CryptoCurreny: If you believe bitcoin will be worth $100,000 some day then just buy and hold. Stop asking Twitter for buy signals
4892 2018-05-18 19:30:50 - Federal baseline "shall-issue" CCW laws, imposing required training & passing extensive tests for CCW applicants. Allow states & local municipalities to impose additional restrictions/requirements
- Ban bump stocks & other devices used to convert semi-autos to full-autos
4893 2018-05-18 19:30:12 I have also grabbed some.. hopefully it wont be so so :)

4897 2018-05-18 19:28:36 Just watching show. “Gun stocks surging. No not surging maybe cuz no AR 15 was involved. I don’t know why.” Just don’t say anything if you don’t know. Generally I like you and show. Today, not so much, you sounded so uneducated. Just don’t.
4898 2018-05-18 19:28:00 The most vulnerable r those who go by the research reports by brokerages on hot stocks n stories..coz someone's buy will facilitate their unloading

4915 2018-05-18 19:22:54 Ted Cruz could make a statement by encouraging the NRA to take steps to work with groups to increase safety locks, prohibit bump stocks, limit magazine sizes and silencers, support universal background checks. You know, common sense gun laws. And refuse NRA money until they do!
4916 2018-05-18 19:22:29 It was a pistol and shotgun, no AR-15 and no bump stocks

4919 2018-05-18 19:21:20 You know what else is a problem? Access to guns like the one that killed 10 students today. Ban semi-automatic guns, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks and institute comprehensive background checks. Until then, you have blood on your hands. #NY19
4920 2018-05-18 19:21:09 How hollow are you?  The facts which have been disclosed. NRA refused age limits, mental capacity   requirements, bump stocks, cartridge limitations. Weapon type limitations. No permits, no paperwork requirements, etc. You are trying to be cute. You're  really not.
4921 2018-05-18 19:20:57 Not ALL guns.  My sister owns a handgun, that is her right. Not trying to undo the 2nd Amendment.  But there is no need for military and assault rifles, guns of high speed and caliber, and bump stocks.  They should all be gone.
4922 2018-05-18 19:20:52 Guns obtained illegally no high capacity clips no bump stocks no assault rifles and still multiple fatalities times to harden the schools spend money on mental health

4924 2018-05-18 19:19:34 Bakwas - success has gone to his head. He thinks too highly of himself.

4926 2018-05-18 19:19:09 @RepJohnFaso Another mass shooting in a school with 10 dead children. Introduce legislation to ban semi-automatic guns, high-capacity magazines & bump stocks & institute comprehensive background checks. Do not let this bloodshed continue. #NY19
4927 2018-05-18 19:19:07 Gun control will solve the problem. Ban bump stocks, introduce universal background checks etc. Period.

4942 2018-05-18 19:11:58 No right to bump stocks, no 2nd amendment right to not have gun time, place + means restrictions, nor is their any constitutional impediment to mandatory background checks and waiting periods. None. The only thing lacking is willpower from the poodles on NRA's leash. Disgusting.

4945 2018-05-18 19:11:19 Yes. Ban Assault Weapons, High Capacity Magazines, Bump stocks, Silencers, and Armor Piercing Bullets. 

ALL OF THIS!
4946 2018-05-18 19:11:14 I am on board with anything that will help. My concern though, is that many of these measures will actually make us less safe. It’s such a complex subject. For example, I am all for banning bump-stocks cause they’re unnecessary, but in all reality how many lives will that save?

4955 2018-05-18 19:07:37 None of these shooters used assault rifles, bump stocks, or silencers(actually only suppressors). They also used only standard capacity mags. Domestic abusers already can’t buy guns. Universal background checks are unconstitutional and pointless.

4978 2018-05-18 18:58:26 Remember how the @NRA, and Republicans, were on board with banning bump stocks?. It's been more than SEVEN MONTHS since Las Vegas, and there's been no movement on that issue from Congress, the WH or the NRA. They have no interest in even the simplest reforms. #GunReformNow
4979 2018-05-18 18:58:22 The ordinance prohibits the sale and possession of assault weapons, as defined by the city. Also outlawed are magazines with high-capacity magazines and bump stocks.
4980 2018-05-18 18:58:10 Counter logic:
Raise voting age to 21 unless in military because voters elect people who write gun laws.
If you ban bump stocks then they will be sold as pieces. If you ban possession then it’s really too late.

4990 2018-05-18 18:50:17 Have you banned bump stocks like you were immediately going to do, have heard nothing!
4991 2018-05-18 18:50:12 Is the privilege of owning tactical gear, armor piercing ammo, bump stocks, and inferior background checks more important than our children’s right to life and safe decent education? Think about what 80 rounds shot off in the blink of and eye can do to a classroom  full of 5yos..
4992 2018-05-18 18:50:06 Easy: raise the age to buy guns to 21, unless in the military. Enact/enforce/modernize universal background checks. Close private gun sale loopholes. Ban bump stocks & high capacity magazines. These are just a start. Notice I’m not screaming TAKE ALL THE GUNS!
4993 2018-05-18 18:50:06 $PFWI 0.0008 looks like next trips to move!
4994 2018-05-18 18:49:28 People in a bull market think it's kind of swag to outperform and pick up stocks where there is over exuberance. 
Performing well in a bull market is just one thing. Conserving most of it in a bear market is so very different and very important.
4995 2018-05-18 18:48:51 Agreed on banning automatic/assault weapons, bump stocks, etc.

Hunting guns (long guns that an expert CAN'T fire 10 rounds/minute) are a whole different kind of problem.

The vast majority (not quite 100%)  of handguns could go, but emphatically NOT all of those.
4996 2018-05-18 18:48:10 @RedlerAllAccess  Bleeding to death in many stocks today...guess I picked all the wrong ones.  Not much held. $BABA, $NVDA, $SPOT
4997 2018-05-18 18:47:48 I say more security guards, stricter background checks, ban mentally disabled people and those with criminal records to have guns, ban AR-15’s, ban Bump-Stocks.Teamwork, that’s what needs to be done to prevent shooting like Santa Fe. @TheDemocrats @GOP @realDonaldTrump Listen now
4998 2018-05-18 18:47:22 You dare to mention compromise when the NRA won't even ban bump stocks and kevlar piercing bullets? She wants to ban weapons that you righties want to use to pretend you're real men.  You aren't even close.

5004 2018-05-18 18:45:17 No, we shouldn't ban all guns. I want the AR-15/bump stocks banned, seems to only be used for carnage. You can have a rifle for hunting, a pistol for protection - properly locked up. There needs to be a registry and enforced background checks for all purchases.

5010 2018-05-18 18:43:21 "If you look at the whole history of [economists], they don't make a lot of money buying and selling stocks, but people who buy and sell stocks listen to them. I have a little trouble with that,"- Warren Buffett
5011 2018-05-18 18:43:19 Our country lasted centuries of armed citizens without school shootings.  In my lifetime they went from a one time tragedy to an epidemic.  It's not the fault of bump stocks or automatic weapons.  We, the people, are the problem.
5012 2018-05-18 18:43:07 Trump already took Executive action months ago to ban bump stocks btw
5013 2018-05-18 18:42:54 Some laws can make it a little more difficult for someone to kill many people in a short amount of time, like banning high capacity magazines and bump stocks.

5022 2018-05-18 18:38:10 Your thoughts and prayers mean nothing without action.  Where is your proposed legislation for comprehensive universal background checks?  Ban of bump stocks?  Closure of the gun show loophole? That #NRA blood money has paid off for them, hasn’t it?

5080 2018-05-18 18:17:28 It's not too soon & never was. Time to bring gun reform bill to the floor.

5081 2018-05-18 18:16:32 Are you thinking some kind of public stocks for them to be shamed in front of the city or simply exile from the country?
5082 2018-05-18 18:16:23 No, that's not what I said at all. I was not that one who said banning bump stocks would be beneficial. Guns are not toys, they can be used for sport, but should not be reduced to being called toys.
5083 2018-05-18 18:16:09 2/How about that now?!  Not allowing illegal firearms or semi's,  automatics, bump stocks etc.  displayed or sold at gun shows & inspections of vendors at gun shows would much help I think.

5094 2018-05-18 18:12:06 The NRA supports banning bump stocks.

5096 2018-05-18 18:10:23 I think there has to be a better way to prevent people who don’t need to have guns in their hands form getting them. There needs to be more laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are capable of this sort of thing. Also, things such as bump stocks, extended magazines,
5097 2018-05-18 18:10:13 I don’t do homie stocks anymore, but I will send thoughts and prayers to the blast zone.
5098 2018-05-18 18:09:24 And so @VP when do you introduce legislation making assault rifles illegal to purchase and bump stocks illegle to own?
5099 2018-05-18 18:07:37 I thought we were talking about stocks
5100 2018-05-18 18:07:11 Theres an argument for bump stocks and high capacity magazines though.

5103 2018-05-18 18:06:55 @Kupona Nice trending stocks but thoughts is such a general term.
5104 2018-05-18 18:06:38 3/ Get rid of these ridiculous concealed carry and Stand-your-ground laws that have harmed far more than they've helped.
Ban all AR-15s and do a buy-back program
Ban all bump stocks
Those proposals would be a good start, IMO.
5105 2018-05-18 18:06:37 @NRA approach. Insult the victims. Afghanistan & Iran vets say AR-15s are weapons made for war and don’t belong on America streets. Gun “collectors” like the one in Las Vegas over 40 semi-automatic weapons that he equipped with bump stocks. We aren’t at war inside our country

5107 2018-05-18 18:06:24 @maddow School shootings and any mass shootings are used for NRA commercial venues. "Thought & prayers" aren't enough; actions speak louder than words. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and keep guns out of reach from children.

5120 2018-05-18 18:01:28 Plus I know all about them stocks cause I’m a business major 
5121 2018-05-18 18:01:28 We're looking at your Marth bitch. Take to smash 4 and losing by 4 stocks.
5122 2018-05-18 18:01:26 je pense que nous avec @postcanada nous sommes les champions de la paresses 3 fois sur 4 ils ne mettent pas le stocks dans leur camion et te colle un papier sur ta porte en te disant t'étais pas là !! Sure il le font discretement ... lol !!
5123 2018-05-18 18:01:16 Stocks and weapon sales went way up during his administration because Fox News convinced its audience that Obama was gonna ban guns and gun accessories and so they’d better stock up. 
5124 2018-05-18 18:00:29 Prices increased across all Districts, generally at a moderate pace... Businesses generally anticipate further price increases in the months ahead, particularly for steel and building materials.

Bump stocks
No Machine Guns 
Stricter Gun Laws
5126 2018-05-18 17:59:25 From 2014 to 2016 stocks started to stall under Obama. Yes, it was growing but at a SNAILS PACE. Trump took office and it set new records. So yeah, new records are new records under Trump. Unemployment under Trump is the lowest has has been in year's. Shocker, not under Obama.
5127 2018-05-18 17:59:16 But you banned bump stocks! That should have stopped all shootings!
5128 2018-05-18 17:59:08 Rubbish people? Limiting access to AR-15s, bump stocks, high-capacity rounds, actually ENFORCING comprehensive background checks. There are so many small, reasonable steps that can be taken to prevent such broad access to these things.
5129 2018-05-18 17:58:41 Also, Parkland had armed security, look how that turned out.
5130 2018-05-18 17:58:10 Some times I set and forget, other times I just watch price an volume of stock.  Selling is hardest thing for me.  P/L% vs. waiting for support or next pivot, and sell some or all.  Most stocks I sell go above my sell price, like CRSP is doing right now.
5131 2018-05-18 17:57:12 Found 7 new books to get from spiritual to stocks to motivation !!
5132 2018-05-18 17:56:37 Unless the armed security are the first to go.
5133 2018-05-18 17:56:03 Listen nothing gets wolf girls goin more than market values and stocks, ive seen it firsthand
5134 2018-05-18 17:55:56 I can show you the exact same model of an AR15 with wood stocks and you would say its safer. Pistols rounds are bigger than an AR round. The shotgun used today is more devastating. Doesn't fit your agenda though.
5135 2018-05-18 17:55:55 I see so many traders lose patience (I used to be one of them), who would then look back and see a market that took off without them. There next excuse is: "well, I can't chase it now" LOL  :) If stocks are still breaking out and holding up near highs, what's the rush to exit? :)
5136 2018-05-18 17:53:58 That's the problem with a signed LOA. Most advisers will pass the comms onto the client but scammers won't. It's not a requirement to issue a copy to the client but it should be, then liaise with the adviser to complete the process.
5137 2018-05-18 17:53:58 And there’s a Mumtaz next door, would have to drive to it though
5138 2018-05-18 17:53:29 Una duda, las stocks de la BMV se mueven similar a las de NASDAQ? O su comportamiento es completamente diferente? Gracias
5139 2018-05-18 17:52:53 Agreed every time. Like the phone rings key words spoken and they act
5140 2018-05-18 17:52:52 There was never a ban on bump stocks. The ATF just realized they couldn't legally regulate them because there was no law in place to do so. Obama happened to be in office at the time, but that's it.
5141 2018-05-18 17:52:33 Where was your outrage when the Obama admin allowed the sale of bump stocks and why didn't he do anything about guns when he had full control for 2 years???? Stop blaming Trump, it's the shooter that did the shooting not Trump or the NRA
5142 2018-05-18 17:51:36 You don't need semi-auto long rifles to protect your kids. You don't need bump stocks to protect your kids. Background checks on every transaction would not impair your ability to protect your kids. Registering weapons would not prevent you from protecting your kids.
5143 2018-05-18 17:51:13 No way mate.past his best. Didn't do much at Leeds to help em. Can see y they may be looking but I'd have thought it was more someone to challenge stocks
5144 2018-05-18 17:49:28 Maybe kids should walk out and march again. Cuz that stupid shit worked...huh? Maybe we should have laws that make guns illegal on school grounds...
Maybe we should ban bump stocks and stop selling AR-15's ... cuz THAT STUPID SHIT WORKED HUH? 

STOP POLITICS SAVE KIDS.

5145 2018-05-18 17:49:26 "MORE guns" = MORE BULLETS = MORE chances to shoot/hit and kill/injure MORE people
If bump stocks aren't good because they can shoot MORE bullets faster how is that NOT the same as having MORE possible shooters shooting more bullets? C'mon ppl, this is SIMPLE LOGIC/REASONING!!!
5146 2018-05-18 17:49:00 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Watching the news. 8-10 children are dead - so far. It strikes me that thoughts and prayers might not be working. At least not as well as would BANNING BUMP STOCKS AND ASSAULT WEAPONS!!!

5153 2018-05-18 17:47:49 Nope. Facts show that the ATF, under the Obama Admin, decided to not regulate Bump Stocks.
5154 2018-05-18 17:47:24 They are trying to ban bump stocks, which would prevent semi-automatic weapons from working like an automatic. Not sure if that would have prevented today’s shooting (I don’t know details).

5163 2018-05-18 17:44:19 I've always been of the opinion that scammers tailor the LoA for the sole purpose of excluding the client from receiving comms. It should always have been a requirement to issue a copy of the initial pack, including Scorpion leaflet & scam warnings, to the client.

5184 2018-05-18 17:37:03 "No federal gun controls have been imposed since Parkland, though the administration is pursuing a proposed regulatory ban on 'bump stocks,'.. The devices were used in an Oct 2017 mass shooting in Vegas that killed 59 people but have not played a role in any major U.S. shootings"
5185 2018-05-18 17:36:48 I am all for banning bump stocks and large capacity clips, silencers and the lot. Unfortunately, I can’t see that making much of a difference but would be all in. The narrative needs to change. Instead of our media spouting assault rifle, they should stick to the truth.

5191 2018-05-18 17:33:45 $BZUN following through just like $SEDG and $ALTR before. This is a clear bullish sign as stocks don't give the late comers a chance to enter. They typically wait until attention is drawn away and then go higher. So you just have to watch them for pullbacks the days/weeks ahead.
5192 2018-05-18 17:33:38 To enforce what exactly? Amending could mean anything? That’s is a “cop-out” answer. I’m asking you the steps you would take to end/reduce these tragedies. Banning bump stocks perhaps? Oh wait, Trump already did that

5197 2018-05-18 17:33:11 @Hiddanas & @Turdhat2 we should create a company that sells thoughts and prayers. In America our stocks would be booming right now.
5198 2018-05-18 17:33:01 First off, thank you for your service. 
As an example, I don't think your PTSD diagnosis would affect you in a total ban on bump stocks. 
But until we get some meaningful legislation on the floor, it's all just speculation.  We need bills to be introduced be fore we can debate.
5199 2018-05-18 17:32:37 That's where solutions fray. I'm more focused on mass shootings (I know they are less than 4% of US gun deaths); other deaths are a huge issue too. There was proposed legislation to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, bump stocks, and military attachments to these guns.
5200 2018-05-18 17:32:28 Making it a federal law to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines and other accessories that can make a weapon a military grade weapon.
5201 2018-05-18 17:31:54 Ah ? Pas plus que les services informatiques, la santé, les services à la personne, etc. Dans la distribution, les coûts, en masse, sont du côté de la gestion des stocks, des transports, des relations avec les fournisseurs, ['marges arrières'].
5202 2018-05-18 17:31:36 Commodities have even more intrinsic value than stocks. Commodities are food, energy, the rawest of industrial materials. Those all have value because you can use them on their own. Explain how you can use bitcoin if your electric grid has failed.
5203 2018-05-18 17:31:34 This blood is on your hands! You didn’t act after Parkland. And you did a 180 after meeting with the NRA. YOU SOLD OUT! Time to step up. Ban bump stocks, eliminate sales of semi-auto weapons, universal background checks - a very concerned independent voter.  #neveragain
5204 2018-05-18 17:31:23 Getting into funds and not individual stocks means he is still "playing the stock market while it is surging" - on average a better strategy than individual stocks or hedge funds.

5207 2018-05-18 17:30:19 Are you f'ing kidding? Democrats are practically begging to be able to do baby steps. Have you forgotten how hard it's been just to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting?  Or to enact universal background checks?
5208 2018-05-18 17:30:18 My math..

Wealthfront had exposure to 250% stocks, bonds, REITs + 100% exposure to cash (now yielding ~1.5%) at an all-in cost of ~6.5% (2.5 x [LIBOR + ~50 bps]+ 0.25% management fee).

@wealthfront happy to correct if wrong
5209 2018-05-18 17:30:02 Exactly..if they should have tell levels prior to happening in stocks we can make positions easily..
Like Nifty levels of short were 10945 and we did made our positions there...in advance. But that day none of the channels mentioned to short nifty except @_anujsinghal
5210 2018-05-18 17:29:49 1. How? Arming teachers? NRA has opposed any measure strengthening gun safety like close gun show loopholes or ban bump stocks! NRA has spent millions of dollars buying elections for their advantages in expense of dying Americans!
5211 2018-05-18 17:28:05 I realized after yesterday’s FPA meeting that if your #Finadvisor only talks about investments, they should also ask you if you want fries with that or to supersize the allocation model. Thanks @MichaelKitces for the info. #stocks #investing #401k

5213 2018-05-18 17:27:38 Ban bump stocks. Limit assault rifle sales to over 21 to start.
5214 2018-05-18 17:27:18 Grief words don’t protect kids!!! Only strict gun control will!!! You failed cos you are beholden to NRA. Strict background checks and ban bump stocks won’t stop a deranged kid from using his parent’s gun for a massacre. Repeal the 2A, or at least  ban all assault rifles!!!
5215 2018-05-18 17:26:36 stocks and collapsing to under 31”, magazine should over 30rds and require two action reload, prohibit flash suppressor an silencers, long foregrips, 22+, 4 day wait, and universal background/mental check and questionnaire and finally a limit to 1 low and 1 high power rifle per
5216 2018-05-18 17:26:01 True. And fact. In IIFL their aim is to make all clients buy their favorite stocks so they recommend all nse stocks buy sell..
5217 2018-05-18 17:25:50 p53 IC this week says at time of writing historic P/E for FTSE100 is 14.2 with 4.2% Dividend Yield - a year ago (and remember Stocks up a lot since then) the numbers were 29.6 and 3.6% .....
5218 2018-05-18 17:25:41 OptionWhale  Trades work because unlike stocks they’re binary, and not even the biggest hedge fund can take a $10 million loss. So when I see on my proprietary options data feeds a $10 million options trade from a hedge fund I’m extremely confident that trade will work.
5219 2018-05-18 17:25:37 To be honest, I would like to see the ban on AR-15-style weapons and bump stocks reinstated. It was effective. Otherwise, I just expect reasonable regulation. I appreciate that you can at least agree. The majority of us only want that.
5220 2018-05-18 17:25:36 Trump: "My administration is doing everything it can to keep our children safe in our schools."

5228 2018-05-18 17:23:00 Stronger background checks absolutely.  Ban bump stocks absolutely.  But these high powered guns EXIST AT.  We need them to fight back against them as well.  Evil exists bro and it isn’t going anywhere.
5229 2018-05-18 17:22:58 Brazilian stocks on free-fall on a triple whammy of a hawkish central bank, Presidential election jitters (happening come October) and more importantly bribery allegations against the President. $EWZ -8.5% this week. My bad trade of the year.
5230 2018-05-18 17:22:13 Of course I think that, can people guarantee me as a parent after they ban bump stocks that a person can’t illegally obtain a gun and shoot my kids?
5231 2018-05-18 17:22:00 No problem you have informal tweets,I'm new trying to learn more from charts i know nothing from them but i find some stocks to make little profit every few days.
5232 2018-05-18 17:21:59 Ban bump stocks and military style weapons.
5233 2018-05-18 17:21:40 What’s going on is a Congress of the United States that doesn’t have the balls to address these slaughters. They couldn’t summon the will to even ban bump stocks. Even 21 first graders massacred didn’t move them and this latest atrocity certainly won’t.
5234 2018-05-18 17:21:22 Like ban bump stocks right? Did Obama do that? Or Clinton? No... People kill people, it’s a mental health problem... Do guns stab people, or poison people, or hang people, or drive cars through crowds, or planes through buildings?
5235 2018-05-18 17:21:21 Hints why I said extensive background checks. Semi-automatic RIFLES are another issue. What circumstances must one possibly be in to where they would need on if they’re not in the military? Bump stocks make the gun mimic automatic fire

5241 2018-05-18 17:17:17 Yeah, I hear that a lot from the GOP/NRA/Fox, but it's a strawman, not a serious proposal coming from legislators on the left or middle-left. 

Banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines doesn't require a repeal of the 2nd amendment. Just votes.
5242 2018-05-18 17:17:02 Never said they weren't muskets. Ar-15s are only as fast as you can make them and don't bring up bump stocks because those destroy your accuracy you won't hit jack using one Of those. And ar-15s aren't military rifles just incase you were gonna say that
5243 2018-05-18 17:16:58 The thing about Trump and guns...
Immediately after the Florida shooting, HE was the one who told them to add
-Universal background checks
-Banning Bump stocks
-Raising the minimum age to 21
What happened to that??? Because two weeks ago in Dallas he was screaming about the 2nd A
5244 2018-05-18 17:16:47 I can't even listen to him...
People say Trump keeps his promises...
Not true.
He promised to make bump stocks illegal but hasn't done it...
&His address to the our 4th party the NRA made me sick.
5245 2018-05-18 17:16:37 Wanna be "with" students & parents across this nation? Support common sense gun law reform: universal background checks, assault weapons ban, ban bump stocks, national gun registry.

Our children deserve to know they're safe & the majority of Americans support these laws!

5246 2018-05-18 17:15:24 Not always, gold or silver coins do have some intrinsic value. Bitcoin behaves like stocks, but stocks at least provide a claim on the assets of the company. Bitcoin is backed by the computers and electric grid, but provides no claim on those assets.

No sales wo background checks. No guns for felons, mentally ill or abusers.
All guns registered and licensed.
All gun owners take safety classes.

No assault style military weapons or bump stocks.

It’s not hard

5256 2018-05-18 17:12:35 JC, I can completely rationalize NOKO talking to SOKO with credit that went to Trump by the SOKO president no less. Also, Jerusalem is now the capital of Israel, the economy is up, stocks hit records when Trump took office. I'd go on but Twitter only allows so many characters.

5264 2018-05-18 17:09:26 Demand from consumers should be the only factor that determines whether or not a store stocks a book. Comic stores have a hard enough time making ends meet without evangelical creators pressuring them to only stock books that fit on the 3x5 index card of allowable opinion

5278 2018-05-18 17:02:45 and why does modest dollar inflation matter so much anyway? If you have wealth, you invest in stocks/bonds, not dollars. Most have no wealth anyway. And those with debt benefit from inflation.  I don’t know the future of Bitcoin, but I do know it’s a currency, not an investment.

5280 2018-05-18 17:02:09 See the thing is you've already been taken in by the narrative that gun reform means all guns are taken away. Literally what people want is civilians to not have access to bump stocks and assault weapons, weapons that are practically designed for mass shootings.
5281 2018-05-18 17:01:26 Haha right? Let call Coach Stocks real quick!
5282 2018-05-18 17:00:57 What has Obama done to prevent/slow gun violence? Trump is the one who banned bump stocks for rifles (lest we forget) Obama has done absolutely nothing for the America besides give us shitty healthcare and worsen race relations. Where was Obama when Baltimore was in flames?
5283 2018-05-18 17:00:39 In addition to Development Offices, public school districts need to have policies in place related to receiving/rejecting gifts.

5285 2018-05-18 17:00:30 Which is exactly why civilians should not be permitted to own assault rifles. Or bump stocks. Your solution is just a bandaid and isn’t addressing the real issue

5288 2018-05-18 16:58:38 There is no gun show loophole, as the media would have you believe, what constitutes "high capacity", define "assault weapon", background checks are already manditory, what good would banning bump stocks do?, Bumping 18 to 21 doesnt change anything,
5289 2018-05-18 16:58:22 Gun stocks rise, the narrative that there is nothing we can do plays, and we wait for the next one hoping it’s not  with any of our loved ones. 

Fuck this country and its lack of any semblance of gun regulation. 

Fuck you @NRA.

5294 2018-05-18 16:55:38 You met and listened to the stories from the Parkland students. Looked them in the eye and said that bump stocks and assault rifles had to be regulated. The next day you met with the NRA and your solution is more guns. Now Santa Fe. SHAME!!!!
5295 2018-05-18 16:55:19 It’s the weapon of choice because of what happens when certain accessories are added. Again, I have zero problem making it harder to obtain those accessories legally or banning some of them. Still, bigger problem too me is communities/schools over bump stocks.

5309 2018-05-18 16:48:53 What is common sense for you?? Cause there are common sense laws that are in place. Background checks are required, have to be a certain age, bump stocks banned. Remember: criminals will always find a way to break the laws in place.
5310 2018-05-18 16:47:51 Americans need more than your vacant words.

5318 2018-05-18 16:44:10 You have to wonder. The Fed. Keeps talking rate hikes meanwhile EVERY TIME bonds sell off (and yields rise) some entity jumps in and buys the bonds making sure rates stay low, so stocks stay high. #FAKEMARKETS

5330 2018-05-18 16:40:33 I thought you solved this Donnie? Bump stocks banned. No banning assault weapons or restrictions on magazines or clips. No mandatory secure storage of weapons or restrictions on ammo. Ask the Parkland kids. They know how to cut down on this slaughter.
5331 2018-05-18 16:40:03 HAHA seriously I’m blue but by less than 1%.  Not my sort of stocks Mick I rarely dabble outside the small caps
5332 2018-05-18 16:39:22 I participated in early voting in the GA primary this morning. On the ballot was a question about whether the sale of bump stocks should be banned here. Finally, some serious movement. Hopefully this measure will pass easily.

5334 2018-05-18 16:38:30 did I miss the part in the news today where bump stocks were involved? They need to go but dont make shit up to further an agenda, its what people bitch at Trump about.
5335 2018-05-18 16:37:46 You dont need a car, take a bus or taxi. No car pyment, no insurance, maint, gas. My point is, too many fingers point at NRA, I agree bump stocks shouldn't be legal, just like a silencer without a class 3. people get in uproar over mags, "assault rifle" every rifle is an assault.
5336 2018-05-18 16:37:43 Everytime a shooting happens in the US, half of me feels absolute heartbreak for the friends and families, and the other half of me is teeming with anger. What will it take for the US to reform gun policy?! And no, eliminating bump stocks is not enough.
5337 2018-05-18 16:37:36 I bet you it was a assault rifle, take a guess. What about the butt-stocks? Nothing
5338 2018-05-18 16:37:31 More reasons for those who don't to be prosecuted? There's clearly a lot of data abuse so can't knock why they're being introduced, even if extra admin is a pain! No doubt some will see them as an excuse for further EU bashing, just as IDS did after mifid2 came in.
5339 2018-05-18 16:37:05 Like by banning bump stocks? That kind of bowing down?

What are you going to do about it?  You are the leader. It is in your hands. 

Please propose bump stocks and the AR-15 are banned and kept out of the hands of US citizens.

Thank you.

He’s helped me almost double my money in stocks before. I’m just going to sit at his feet and learn. Crypto is not where you should go.

5350 2018-05-18 16:33:04 Arming teacher and placing more police in schools is not the answer. We must get rid of high velocity weapons, ammo and bump stocks.

5357 2018-05-18 16:29:12 he did do something he banned bump stocks & this still happened why because he did not address crazy. You get rid of all guns in this country and you will have to deal with students setting their schools on fire with people inside. You want to stop this address crazy.

5362 2018-05-18 16:26:58 Maybe it is because the correlation between bonds and stocks is weak or moderate rather than absolute? Why do some traders become emotionally wedded to the patterns they think they see? Rhetorical question -- it is one of the traits of human brains :)

5366 2018-05-18 16:24:43 Bullshit bump stocks are still legal to obtain and illegal to use.
That is just one factor.

5368 2018-05-18 16:23:57 @rushlimbaugh After Parkland, Trump wanted to raise age of gun purchase to 21 and ban bump stocks.  Rush followers and NRA talked him out of it.   @BoSnerdley vote for common sense gun safety in November.
5369 2018-05-18 16:23:48 Then VOTE FOR gun safety legislation.  Get rid of assault rifle sales in this country.  Prohibit the future sale of bump stocks and offer to buy-back if anyone wants to turn theirs in now.  DO SOMETHING.  BULLETS ARE NOT STOPPED BY PRAYERS.

@Emma4Change we have to vote them out.
5370 2018-05-18 16:23:43 The top five most active stocks today at noon today are $AMD, $AMAT, $MU, $BAC, and $CPB,
5371 2018-05-18 16:23:24 "No one needs high capacity mags and bump stocks and..." And I reply before they finish "yeah no one needs a car that can do 200mph or go 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds"
5372 2018-05-18 16:23:15 And one needn’t be in favor of bizarre draconian laws and throwing people in stocks to think “Hey, given that, maybe we ought to return to monogamy/children being the expected societal standard, and stop promoting/glorifying a sexual free-for-all.”
5373 2018-05-18 16:22:54 We should be investigating whether or not Trump, Trump's family or friends own those stocks. And if they do prosecute Donald Trump. I heard that Trump is purposefully manipulating the stock market to put dollars in his own pocket.
5374 2018-05-18 16:22:52 Bump stocks are already banned and an AR-15 is a semi auto rifle not an assault rifle. The AR-15 also shoots lower caliber bullets then some handguns. Having guns laws to limit AR-15's is tricky because you would also limit a lot of other guns people deem "ok".

5380 2018-05-18 16:21:34 Here in MD, we stood up to @NRA, banned assault rifles, banned bump stocks, banned domestic abusers from owning guns, and passed "red flag" legislation. There's no easy way to say this so I'll just say it: other states should quite simply do the same.

5392 2018-05-18 16:16:31 How about getting your "heart" to do something and encourage your husband to look at this issue.  He won't even let the CDC study gun violence!  He won't ban bump stocks.  Your "heart" going out isn't doing a damn thing.

5397 2018-05-18 16:15:08 He is finally trying to regulate Bump Stocks. Oh and he is your leader as well.
5398 2018-05-18 16:15:05 My favorite stocks are twitter and Tesla.
5399 2018-05-18 16:14:50 Do something, then! You won't even let the CDC study gun violence.  You won't ban bump stocks.  You are on the NRA payroll, obviously.
5400 2018-05-18 16:14:20 Close gun show and private sale loopholes, ban high capacity mags, standardized & mandatory background checks, ban assault weapons, require licensing, training, and insurance, allows the CDC to study gun violence, increase age from 18 to 21, ban bump stocks, etc etc etc.
5401 2018-05-18 16:12:40 Stock buy backs benefit everyday people: trillions of dollars are invested in stocks by public pension portfolio managers, private IRA’s, 401K’s. Buy backs transfer profits to shareholders in the form of capital gains. Did they cover that cool fact in remedial economics 101?
5402 2018-05-18 16:12:08 China trade talks in focus, gold hammeredAsian stocks closed mostly mixed, while European shares have struggled for direction ahead of today’s high-level trade talks between the U.S. and China...
5403 2018-05-18 16:12:05 Enough with the prayers. We need  action. It has been over 5 months since 58 we slain in Las Vegas and you couldn’t even ban bump stocks. This needs to stop now!
5404 2018-05-18 16:10:19 Read the section that describes Donald's stock trading. Trump was actively buying stocks in 2017. Not in a blind trust, he personally bought individual stocks as a sitting POTUS, then made policy via Twitter. This is the most corrupt administration since Teapot Dome.
5405 2018-05-18 16:09:41 Well if it wasn't ok to kill children they would ban ar15s and bump stocks.  Tougher gun control laws just like there is tough abortion laws.
5406 2018-05-18 16:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
5407 2018-05-18 16:07:49 I was talking about 22s, hand guns, hunting rifles, the stuff we actually use. Didnt mention assault rifles, since currently im not for an immediate ban or keeping them around entirely. Bump stocks arent guns so them being banned doesnt fall under guns being banned.
5408 2018-05-18 16:06:49 Aww poor baby  the owner should be put in the stocks & have rotten potatoes chucked at them

5420 2018-05-18 16:03:38 A ban on assault weapons, a ban on bump stocks, a ban on high-capacity magazines, background checks, close the gun show loophole, raise the age for purchasing a semi automatic weapon of any kind to 21, just for starters…

and yes, I am a gun owner.

5424 2018-05-18 16:02:20 No AR-15s, no one under 18 can buy a gun, all guns must be registered, no bump stocks, you get fined for improperly stowing a gun that kills someone,and common sense.

YOU could literally have signed a bill to ban assault rifles or bump stocks or anything but you’ve done nothing but be an absolute flat out liar
5428 2018-05-18 16:00:18 @WalshFreedom maybe it’s their parents that sit in fear. Doesn’t matter, we don’t need banana magazines and bump stocks and schools with open borders.

5434 2018-05-18 15:58:36 Under the control of the Obama Admin, the ATF refused to regulate Bump Stocks......
5435 2018-05-18 15:58:31 Easy to call out unspecified none action, what about all of the new legislation passed in regards to stocks and automatics. These shootings aren’t as much of a gun availability problem as a mental health and screening problem.
5436 2018-05-18 15:57:28 Overvalued stocks and the ability to run up a corporation's value overnight to drive stock price has only fueled this fire since the 2000 & 2008 market drops.
5437 2018-05-18 15:57:10 U.S. stocks indexes edged mostly lower in morning trading Friday, adding to the market's modest losses from a day earlier. Banks, technology and energy companies fell, offsetting gains by industrial stocks. Bond prices rose, sending yields lower.
5438 2018-05-18 15:56:15 Yeah cause that’s not true that’s not been the response of the US government… Bump stocks?? Arm the teachers.. both parties are parasitic enabler‘s. But thanks for playing

5443 2018-05-18 15:54:46 Thank you for debating respectfully! I am trying to say that things like bump stocks should be heavily regulated, along with better background checks. I agree that we do need higher security I many places but I do think that’s only part of the problem we’re facing.
5444 2018-05-18 15:54:18 Keep hiding from the truth snowflake. 8 years of Obama doing nothing and keeping bump stocks legal... that’s part of the Obama legacy.

5449 2018-05-18 15:52:41 1. Explain what you believe is the gun show loophole.
2. Yes I agree 100%
3. Yes we should ban bump stocks because it makes a semi-automatic weapon an automatic weapons.
5450 2018-05-18 15:52:09 Is very intriguing. Had been expecting that the big spec short would close on asset prices lower. Close of open FX positions seems to be doing it, but perhaps this fuels more buying of stocks and oil.
5451 2018-05-18 15:51:36 Of course it’s garbage in terms of FastMoney because it’s not ‘fast’ rather longterm, haha.  How’s people have no patience in these days... in my portolio I have hold few stocks over 12 years, lambo chat in crypto forums looks just embarrassing.

5453 2018-05-18 15:51:18 How about closing the gun show loophole, making it so mentally ill people and domestic abusers cannot buy guns, and banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines?

5458 2018-05-18 15:50:41 That just means japanese stocks are priced partially in USD and other global currencies, not just in yen. When the yen is "smaller" you need more of them to come to the "same" valuation.
5459 2018-05-18 15:50:35 he just banned bump stocks and where did that get us?

5473 2018-05-18 15:45:49 Wasn’t he going to do something about bump stocks and age of purchase? He tweeted that he would and then crickets. It’s the entire GOP to blame. Only solution is voting for Democrats
5474 2018-05-18 15:45:17 School shooting in Santa Fe, Texas! It's just what we need: more guns. This will only end when we ban the NRA, automatic weapons, bump stocks. Close the gun show and individual sales loopholes. Enough is enough? #EnoughIsEnough

We did some research on this ~ 10 years ago and there is extremely strong preference for national stocks and indexes, even though diversifying into multiple countries didn't come at significant cost and did reduce risk.

5482 2018-05-18 15:40:59 My thing is that in order to have balance, there needs to be a willful action on both sides to move the ball towards to the middle. Bump stocks have been banned, tougher background checks established through FixNICS, states have raised gun owning age. We need to change culture.

5495 2018-05-18 15:35:45 Opex- Options Expiry. It affects stocks by pin pricing, that is, typically large vol & OI attract price on the underlying. Gamma also can cause issues.

5503 2018-05-18 15:32:59 Stocks started trading in negative territory this morning, but the DOW is starting to ease into positive territory.  MBS is rebounding after it's beatdown this week, and is currently up 27bps.  Yields have slipped some, down to 3.07% (off from 3.11%).
5504 2018-05-18 15:32:49 Will they mention that all "common sense solutions"  recently proposed would not have prevented this? "Assault weapon" ban? Shotgun. Age limit of 21? It was a student. Magazine capacities? Bump stocks? Nope. What would prevent this? Armed security check at a single entry point.
5505 2018-05-18 15:32:44 Thank you for sharing this. I continue to be stunned this tragedy didn’t result in policy changes. Bump stocks are still legal.

5583 2018-05-18 15:02:06 I've always wondered why people who are an expert on one thing are considered an authority on stocks and bonds. Woz is wrong and overrated.
5584 2018-05-18 15:02:00 It's the same logical fallacy that supports trickle-down economy as if the ultra-rich corporations are not just using the tax cut to buy back their stocks and inflate the prices, or supporting the ignorant argument that they might do something nice for us because they have extra.
5585 2018-05-18 15:01:27 They won't acknowledge that guns are part of the issue. Obviously, mental health is the biggest, but guns are a vehicle for mass murder. I'm not even on board with banning all guns, but the assault rifles and bump stocks are insane

5592 2018-05-18 14:58:44 Question: Do OTC market makers hold large inventories of the stocks in which they make markets?
5593 2018-05-18 14:57:56 So with an 11% drop in stocks, I guess Wall-street didn’t think it was “mmmm.  mmmm good”
5594 2018-05-18 14:57:38 Also background checks, and I really don't see the point of bumper stocks (to make semi-automatic weapons fully automatic) or high-capacity magazines (how many do you need to kill?). 
But mental health IS a problem, and also needs addressing. I couldn't agree more on that.
5595 2018-05-18 14:57:33 Yes crude oil prices have risen last few days but God knows how that affects old petrol stocks unless a way has been found to take crude to refineries, refine to petrol and ship it to petrol stations in 24 hours!!!

5751 2018-05-18 13:52:16 The cost i paid today was 5 times of my greed.......markets taught me a lesson..Yes market is the Bad teacher .it taught me how to remove stupidity from myself..never ever go to crap stocks never.. ..any way ur words are really worth reading.good work bro..
5752 2018-05-18 13:52:05 Absolutely. 

More rules to follow (and therefore costs and admin) for those who follow them. 

More to willfully ignore for those who don't.
5753 2018-05-18 13:52:05 And you still work in your daily job and earn money. And this would be the safest investment. you can still take a higher risk or invest into cryptos or direct into stocks and not #efts or #funds

5762 2018-05-18 13:49:50 No worries, as with all views I could be entirely wrong, but increasingly some of these healthcare/pharma stocks feel like short term value traps to me
5763 2018-05-18 13:49:05 I have to admit that the action in $AMZN and $NVDA doesn't appear constructive to me. While I am rather bullish on the market I guess that price action in both will resolve to the downside. Both stocks provide nice risk/rewards entries on the short side.
5764 2018-05-18 13:48:15 Such comments media and Sebi should interrogate and also see to it that what has happened in few days . Is Sebi taking note of such comments

5779 2018-05-18 13:40:20 Thank you for the response. I'm trying to balance buying every set up while not taking on too much overall portfolio risk (along with avoiding over diversification).  

In the last month it seems like many growth stocks have broken out after consolidating near their 52 week high

5827 2018-05-18 13:16:48 Very interesting. I’m assuming these are companies who don’t buy back their stocks in large quantities, and benefit the most from a Trump tax cut(?). Can it last with such high median valuations and a red for US lower growth rates and higher inflation?

5858 2018-05-18 12:58:27 At the minimum, we’d really like to hold the break above the 2712 level, which became the second lower high of the downtrend line from late January to mid April.    Certainly the move in oil into the mid to high $70s and the rally in energy stocks has helped fuel this breakout.

5874 2018-05-18 12:47:36 With Canadian energy stocks I'm mainly focused on fundamentals...most of them are fairly extended now I think but I've got my core group of names I'm holding and I'd add on a pullback...I like CPG, BTE, Raging River, Spartan...even some heavy oil names like MEG are on my radar
5875 2018-05-18 12:47:29 Wall street scamming investors and IRAs again today, stock trashing already starting. Pure corruption and fraud with shorting then dumping their client's stocks. Investing becoming a joke as financials are completely ignored, 3 quarters of the same. Get the SEC off their butts
5876 2018-05-18 12:45:43 Daily Flow @ContraAquam  Thursday indices fell due to continued negotiations with China and N.

5877 2018-05-18 12:45:01 Even more so there is a minimum length a rifle can be including the telescoping stock I have not heard one gun grabber demanding we increase the minimum length of the rifle so any ban on telescoping stocks just means people with longer arms will need to buy a pad it does nothing

5879 2018-05-18 12:44:38 Yes I owned 1400 stocks in my portfolio. What is easy to miss is this - less than 1% of the fund's assets were invested in more than 500 companies for all kinds of reasons. Learning and developing the story of what you own and why was a key part of my strategy.

5884 2018-05-18 12:43:10 The best part about people who own kachra stocks in a dabba portfolio is that equity forms just a small proportion of their total portfolio. Had equity been a large part of their net worth they would never have bet so much on kachra, chakri and crap.

5930 2018-05-18 12:27:22 @DeanBaker13 excellent points. But all this assumes that stocks will rise JUST in step with the economy and profit growth. You assume a rational market. My point is that all the factors I listed sees the rich with more money, and that they'll park it in stocks (irrationally).

5946 2018-05-18 12:18:19 Interesting, Patrick. In a bear market, selling pressure drives down most everything, called "serial correlation", as selling begets more selling. With that said, we've had 2 significant bear markets since 2000, real quick: what stocks met your criteria above during them?

6033 2018-05-18 11:17:28 IWM is outperforming the S&P because the dollar has been rallying. As the dollar rolls over & heads for lower lows, I would expect the larger cap, multinational stocks to outperform. Weak dollar should be a defining element in the coming parabolic blow-off.

6035 2018-05-18 11:16:41 Why some stocks fall even if they post good results and why some stocks rise if even they post bad results eg escorts and axis bank ICICI bank. Unable to understand logic behind this thing.

6039 2018-05-18 11:15:18 This years bear market in Crypto and Stocks has made me a much better trader. When this happens, you can either cry wishing they would go up, or you can learn.

Anyone can profit in a Bull market. To be profitable over time it's imperative to know how to trade any kind of market.

6052 2018-05-18 11:04:02 Commodities in a portfolio sound good, they just don’t work good. I tried 20 years ago and they didn’t work then either.  I’m all about cash-flow. Stocks, bonds, real estate and cash equivalents. If the asset class doesn’t produce interest, rent or dividends, it’s not for me.
6053 2018-05-18 11:03:50 For those of us that barely survive on minimum wage, $7.50 an hour, there are no stocks, bonds, investment ops. No advantages from the tax scam. My tax debt went from 10% to 15%. #richGetRicher

6104 2018-05-18 10:26:40 Sorry to hear of the hefty loss. I don't use guaranteed stops as I find they are too far away. Just checked and it is 12 points away. However you have got me thinking and it is maybe something I should start doing. We all know stocks can drop much more overnight.
6105 2018-05-18 10:26:40 what up, is that stocks or mutual funds? your doin alright
6106 2018-05-18 10:25:56 yes may be those midcap are having good fundamental can rebound, atleast PSU banks when govt. announce recapitalization etc. we need to stick to large cap nifty 50 stocks , even if they fall they normally rebounds or even goes upward .

6119 2018-05-18 10:15:03 Clients, on occasion, ask me why we don’t have more exposure to stocks outside the U.S.  The S&P 500 Index has returned 1.5% year to date, moving ahead of the MSCI EAFE Index's 0.9% return and the modest 0.7% loss for the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index.  THAT is why. ..  :-)

6125 2018-05-18 10:09:30 Fool hardly anyone even owned bump stocks they are inaccurate and most legitimate Gun owners who go to the Range who practice are looking for accuracy not Spray and pray. Shooting an automatic rifle is fun under secure range conditions but in real life take aimed shot every time.
6126 2018-05-18 10:08:29 Credit where it's due mate. Wishing you all the best with this 
6127 2018-05-18 10:07:48 I think the shares you have are normal. I also have shares of those things (in index funds) and not all of the services. You'd have to have some of those to make a well-rounded portfolio. Whether others who make their own portfolio of single stocks would be like that, no idea.
6128 2018-05-18 10:07:28 18Cr is not a big amount for RJ. And he has bought the stock with long term perspective. People expect stocks to go up by 75-100% within a week of buying by RJ. We should now realise that this is not 2017.

6130 2018-05-18 10:06:53 Do you mean the sales proceeds that governments receive from issuing bonds, or the proceeds that investors make from selling their bond holdings? If the latter then I guess it would rotate into either stocks or commodities ?

6138 2018-05-18 10:03:13 Grow up boy. I am smarter than that. That is why I said mid and small cap funds and not stocks. And also that money invested at the top reduces returns or makes them vanish. If you invest one time and in the stock that does become large cap obviously u will make lots of money

6155 2018-05-18 09:45:25 If bond yields rise so that equities yield less relative to bonds, shouldn’t  this lead to falls in stock prices such that stocks once again give a higher yield than bonds?

Ultimately, SHOULD stocks yield more than bonds? Seems to be the common conception that they should...

6157 2018-05-18 09:44:23 there are still so many bulls who have defended this market with vigor and money who see zero chance of that happening.

Today it opened ex dividends and seperately added the amount of the dividend. Today the stocks have earned back a little of the dividend. By that the DAX is lifted a bit. Correct?

6183 2018-05-18 09:11:37 It was recommendation not compulsion. I didn't buy housing stocks because obviously if govt changes they will change contractors.

When down trend starts Midcap stocks leads the downside first and largecap join the trend later.

And current situation indicate the same.

6657 2018-05-18 02:28:44 A lot of investors are everyday Americans that invest retirement into stocks. I just don’t like penalizing hard work. We should incentivize it. Our govt does the opposite.

6684 2018-05-18 02:01:10 The argument isn't about small-cap stocks' raw returns, but their risk adjusted returns and whether they deserve to be on equal footing with value, momentum, etc. AQR says risk-adjusted returns are bad and size is weak as a distinct factor.

6747 2018-05-18 01:07:24 Just bought penny stocks in a gold mining company while watching wrestling. Time to grab a rocker, set out on the porch, and wait for progress to anger me

6750 2018-05-18 01:04:53 Bump stocks aren't guns, ass hat.
6751 2018-05-18 01:03:07 I’ve seen worse. But there are better stocks to be in, imo.
6752 2018-05-18 01:02:48 I remember being mad when my 2 year CD dropped from 7.5 to 6%. If there wasn’t all this daily macro crisis I would enjoy an interest rate increase and stocks could absorb the shock without tanking.
6753 2018-05-18 01:00:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing stocks.
6754 2018-05-18 00:56:22 I disagree they don't act as humans to other humans MS-13 is horrible and therefore should be dehumanizing but  what do I know I just do stocks and make money
6755 2018-05-18 00:55:37 what you know about Stocks?
6756 2018-05-18 00:55:24 Yeah yeah I agree it applies to all arms but like Emily said it was written before we bumb stocks and rifles that are a lot easier to perform mass shootings with
6757 2018-05-18 00:53:48 Lol...you didn't even see the full exchange.
6758 2018-05-18 00:52:21 @F3atherIO dang.. plz little more stocks.. i just got up now lol
6759 2018-05-18 00:52:15 I was thinking that also until I realized how crappy it was. It's sticky but never fully sticks to the seats. I will look into 3M stocks too. Just in case!!! Train might finally MAKE me money. HAHAHAH

6764 2018-05-18 00:47:29 I don't know but penny stocks didn't have innate inflation. The price stayed constant when nobody did anything.
6765 2018-05-18 00:47:21 Thank you Jason, the salmon stocks are plentiful enough elsewhere but its eastern WA state that stocks have plummeted due to environmental issues, overfishing and too many dams. Chinook,Steelhead salmon is at a 30 yr. low.
6766 2018-05-18 00:44:16 @realDonaldTrump my stocks are still down, plz fix.
6767 2018-05-18 00:43:19 Again, with all respect. I don’t say stuff just to say it. You have to agree gas prices are up. You also have to agree that the tax plan has not benefited employees (even Rubio has said this). Stocks are only up 16% since trump took over (compared to 50% under Obama.).
6768 2018-05-18 00:41:46 I swear when my family comes into town my mom stocks the pantry like she's prepping for the apocalypse
6769 2018-05-18 00:41:25 Wonderful! You mean we are finally banning assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks so our children will be safer in school? Thank you!!!!

6771 2018-05-18 00:40:42 Yep... unless you think biotech stocks literally have a negative value
6772 2018-05-18 00:40:25 just follow the system,  why should some name disappoint you or attract you, whats the compulsion to buy it at some point of time,   just follow the system dear not stocks!!!
6773 2018-05-18 00:40:03 bump stocks are currently out of production, please find some other firearm accessory to protest, hey did you hear about the Magic windows in Las Vegas, some guy shot through them like a thousand times and they didn't get damaged, WOW cool huh, don't base your life false flags
6774 2018-05-18 00:39:04 I hate Bump Stocks, but the codified regulations that BATFE, is legally bound to follow are for “firearms”.  Not 80% complete non guns, or accessories that don’t modify the action of a semi auto firearm from semi to auto! Next you’ll want to ban #Miculek’s fingers #gunsense

6776 2018-05-18 00:38:03 With all respect - none of what you wrote is true at all & I'm pretty sure you know this. His record speaks for itself. Unemployment & the wage gap, even minority & woman unemployment down to record levels. Stocks have gained 36% since he got in, growth rate at 3.5%. All is well

6779 2018-05-18 00:33:57 I never said anything about government doing any trickling down. It has been shown over and over if corporations are taxed less they will use the money to buy back stocks, not add more jobs or pay higher wages. This is why CEO’s make 400% more then in the 1960’s. Greed
6780 2018-05-18 00:33:46 buy me an Astro cord rich boy, just kidding. Invest in stocks become BigTymeR pt 2
6781 2018-05-18 00:33:35 Trump was buying stocks in 2017 as President. Not in a blind trust. How is this legal?

6784 2018-05-18 00:30:40 Hope no followers short #OCDO before announcement. Hopefully hedgies were smashed though. I don't like this practice, never have, never will. In any scenario, sport, stocks, wanting failure doesn't sit right for me.
6785 2018-05-18 00:30:20 Interesting. 

Both stocks got a little post conference call bump...

Must be the "speak truth to power" crowd rewarding the CEO's for their "bold stance."

Shit slid downhill rather rapidly thereafter.
6786 2018-05-18 00:28:40 Please tweet my China stocks to the moon Mr. President!
6787 2018-05-18 00:26:09 How do you think the legalized sports betting / gambling will affect the market? Specifically which stocks and why? I would love to hear your thoughts! :)
6788 2018-05-18 00:26:01 That's actually not too bad given how stocks work given how little you had.

6790 2018-05-18 00:21:57 You are a moron. Corporate tax cuts (and individual tax cuts) have made the US one of the most friendly countries to do business & it’s why GDP has doubled, employment has soared, stocks r at all-time highs & ordinary Americans have more money in their paychecks.
6791 2018-05-18 00:20:36 I bought OTM Jan 19 mid-last year....wrong time.....got out at loss....maybe I can help you by selling my shares. Typically, when I sell, stocks rips. LoL

6795 2018-05-18 00:16:28 Get a grip @NRA AR-15's, auto,  semi-auto & bump stocks Are not all guns!!! Yes, military style weapons should be out lawed and only used in military combat, not in civilian neighborhoods, schools and college campuses across America!!!
6796 2018-05-18 00:16:27 Exactly, I sell stocks, when time (fuck u mitk)
6797 2018-05-18 00:16:23 Buy dividend stocks. They will be worth a fortune.
6798 2018-05-18 00:15:29 After the Las Vegas shooting, Sen. Feinstein introduced the “Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act” to ban the sale and possession of bump stocks & devices that essentially turn a semiautomatic weapon to fire in fully-automatic mode also claiming it would have prevented the shooting.
6799 2018-05-18 00:15:04 and the apple futures trading volume is already higher than the total volume of all four thousand chinese domestic listed stocks trading
6800 2018-05-18 00:14:09 Every word of this is utter nonsense. He’s profiting immensely from his presidency. He’s buying and selling stocks. He’s doing deals. He’s funneling government business through his properties. Nothing about his behavior or track record would suggest otherwise.
6801 2018-05-18 00:14:07 Eastside stocks tomorrow . Whole bity dry
6802 2018-05-18 00:12:19 $SPY $IWM If it wasn't so serious it would be funny; seeing post last week stating things like stocks/markets overbought. Avoid the noise.
6803 2018-05-18 00:11:29 Who knows how to read stocks??? :(
6804 2018-05-18 00:10:57 You r an idiot. The economy is thriving, unemployment is at record lows, GDP is twice that vs the anemic 1.5% avg under Obama, consumer confidence is surging & ordinary people r seeing more money in their paychecks in decades. For anyone in stocks & 401Ks, stock buybacks r great!
6805 2018-05-18 00:10:56 Asia stocks shrugged off the negative Wall St lead to begin positive across the board, as the rhetoric regarding US-China trade and North Korea somewhat digresses from the earlier pessimism; ASX 200 (+0.2%), Nikkei 225 (+0.2%), KOSPI (+0.4%)
6806 2018-05-18 00:10:50 It IS the weapon! ARs make it easy to mow down lots of people in a short time from a long distance. Don't forget bump stocks to make it automatic!
6807 2018-05-18 00:09:13 Hey Arkansans. Thank Tom Cotton, John Boozman and Steve Womack for killing soy bean profits, stocks, and adding to farm losses. Rice, too?
