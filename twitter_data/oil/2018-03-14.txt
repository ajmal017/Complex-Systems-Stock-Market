4 2018-03-14 23:59:35 The Republicans have proven they will sell out to lobbyists at the expense of their constituents. 

Big oil owns the GOP. 

We get nowhere appealing to what we’re once shared human values.

As we are seeing with guns, pressuring them & the lobbyists for playing dirty works.
5 2018-03-14 23:59:33 Reed is 100% correct. Aside from hating oil the Liberals could not execute properly on a commitment to save their lives. There is no file they have touched in the last 28 months that is not a disaster.

34 2018-03-14 23:56:24 I was having the same problem so I started exfoliating with baking soda and coconut oil together and I’ve already noticed a difference with my skin as a whole as well! I can barely see my pores and some dark spots have also faded! You’ll have to use a light cleanser after though
35 2018-03-14 23:56:12 Dear Noam Chomsky,
How do you clean your bellybutton? I wouldn't bug you but you're a smart guy & this problem has been bedeviling me for some time. Ive done the Q-tip & baby oil thing but it gets sore before it gets clean. Any suggestions? I'm at the end of my umbilical. (haha).
36 2018-03-14 23:56:09 these hair companies keep adding coconut oil to every product when it’s actually trash
37 2018-03-14 23:56:03 I remember n/wanting to look at U due to how my father spoke of U and the change U were to bring. Then when his face as he felt U sold out to special interest (NRA,oil,RNC) he died of complications of Agent Orange years ago. You were his hero, recent actions-i can look at U again

40 2018-03-14 23:55:58 I can’t get my head around cups. Because how can you measure cups of things like raisins vs flour or oil? It seems a bit backward to me, frankly...

44 2018-03-14 23:55:42 Try some vegetable oil
45 2018-03-14 23:55:11 Someone had complained about our body oil being unscented & smelling like oil, well. It’s an oil, a mixture of 10+ oils that are amazing for your skin. I didn’t want to ruin that by adding a fragrance when many people have sensitive skin, like me. Which is why it’s unscented
46 2018-03-14 23:55:09 Silicone lube lasts muchhh longer than coconut oil, but coconut oil is better for my skin. Find something that suits you

55 2018-03-14 23:54:15 That’s crap. Kiddo’s school handled it well.  We all talked about it over dinner other night. She walked but her school was more celebrating the victims. No gun nonsense per se. This district does a good job. They’ve had several armed SRO’s on campus for yrs & we like that fact.
56 2018-03-14 23:54:08 My grandma has been in the kitchen all day making me food to take back to school, my grandpa has been out changing my oil in my car.. I do not deserve them
57 2018-03-14 23:54:06 Because I was craving an ice cream bar, I picked up 2 of the supplies needed for Friday's oil spill lab in APES
58 2018-03-14 23:53:59 Tea tree oil tends to dry my skin out, so I put on moisturizer after using that one. The proatin mask did amazing things for me. Those are the only two I’ve tried so far!
59 2018-03-14 23:53:50 Please keep a few stores open! This is just sad to see you guys go...
60 2018-03-14 23:53:47 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
61 2018-03-14 23:53:34 Great work.  Did you already do your first oil change?  Also, how do you secure your scoot when out running errands?
62 2018-03-14 23:52:54 Oh God no...../o\ DOnt start pimping him again. This guy hijacks every movement he sees for his own ends. He is anti-gun control. Always has been & was arrogantly stating he would not apologise to Sandy Hook victims for it. He is a snake oil salesman not a leader
63 2018-03-14 23:52:48 you think i can crush them up freebase into oil and smoke it in a Pax?
64 2018-03-14 23:52:46 Olive oil is my favorite.

67 2018-03-14 23:52:27 Do you use oil? Because if you don't I think that's the most life changing thing I added...
68 2018-03-14 23:52:24 Hard to disagree with $YGR as favorite, have to say it's offered the best return so far. $ERF maybe next with its US assets. I like $SGY because of the dividend and buybacks. $CJ also strong. $BTE will have nice leverage to the oil price and operations in US. Those would be a few

72 2018-03-14 23:51:52 talk to the director of the center, she gave false proofs and they would do the maintenance. After 30 minutes, the receptionist came up to me and said to me: Sorry, the oil filter was not in the branch and we will send a representative from the transit city.
73 2018-03-14 23:51:38 I don't expect that to happen to someone who hasn't sniffed too much Jasmine oil.
74 2018-03-14 23:51:34 That's funny - Tides foundation got them elected and has destroyed billions in Canadian wealth by opposing the oil industry
75 2018-03-14 23:51:33 well today's stream ended up a little messy, I just wanted to find out what happens when you combine Crude Oil and Magma. Thanks for all the viewership love for all the nonsense. #OxygenNotIncluded
76 2018-03-14 23:51:32 I bought some castor oil and other junk to hopefully help fix my bald spot and my mom had the audacity to tell me I wasted my money cause I inherited it from my dad! All hope is gone

82 2018-03-14 23:50:51 You Cheat ur taxes and invest in oil pipelines. Plus you’re a racist. THE PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS WILL NOT LET YOU BUY YOUR WAY INTO POWER
83 2018-03-14 23:50:49 I wanna rotate your tires, fix your oil drip, wash your windshield, and put a dent your fender.
84 2018-03-14 23:50:45 Do not throw them out! They can be scrubbed n re seasoned with oil n baked. Look it up on line or go to a favorite cook of yours n ask them. Good luck let up know how u make out. I've seen on Trisha Year woods cooking show where she got cast iron pans at a flea mkt n cleaned them
85 2018-03-14 23:50:38 Russia doesn’t want war with USA any more than we want it with them. US and Russia need to find common ground in ending Middle East conflicts that Obama’s weakness allowed. With Russia it’s all about their ability to sell oil which is a pipeline through Syria, let them.

94 2018-03-14 23:49:34 Not convinced Pete. CA’s efficiency measures show leadership in EVs, which helps accelerate adoption in rest of world: likely reducing global demand for oil vs no CA action. Would EVs be this advanced globally without CA? Don’t think so. But yes, FF supply also important!

101 2018-03-14 23:47:57 Haven't tried all variations but the 1 Joon recommended is good for countries with the winter season, imo. When i woke up the next day, my face was an oil field  & tnid was just 1 use. i like the green 1 they recommended.
102 2018-03-14 23:47:53 Pickled bamboo shoots in garlic chili oil are a really fucking dangerous snack.
103 2018-03-14 23:47:44 Hell the guy that owns the local gas station or bar, local food joints. They went and did it. Watching a movie doesn't help, watching a local entrepreneur even if does oil changes for a living will take you much further.
104 2018-03-14 23:47:28 It’s even good, that means the oil is really bubbling

129 2018-03-14 23:43:40 A lot of that has to do with alcohol taxes that were implemented to supplement oil revenue drops though. Not defending, but...

148 2018-03-14 23:39:30 Petey, no one is banning anyone from seeking real mental health care from qualified professionals. They're banning quack, grifters like you and Stephie from scamming vulnerable people with your snake oil.

150 2018-03-14 23:39:06 Easy, just make sure the argan oil is not deodorized and extra virgin, add 4 drops of rosemary & peppermint essential oil, massage your scalp daily for 7 days. check our Argan oil, we've had super happy feedbacks from customers who got rid of flacks & dandruff with our product ;)

154 2018-03-14 23:38:03 My battery for my oil pen wasn’t working so I went to get a new one from the smoke shop, so she told me to try using the battery to see if it worked before I bought it, I literally took a fat dab & died as people walked in & they said “that smells good” 
155 2018-03-14 23:37:58 Why don't you start paying the taxes on oil exportaciones that the standard oil company never paid to my country for more than 30 years you farsant

157 2018-03-14 23:37:47 I'm leaking oil over here because the Giants are trying and they're being so earnest. Really screwed with my shot.
158 2018-03-14 23:37:19 Walmart beard oil, Walmart beard and scruff cream, Amazon polished gentleman beard shampoo and conditioner and buy a boar bead brush. Cleaner you keep the better
159 2018-03-14 23:37:17 And this is a country that we could hurt by exporting more oil with pipelines to the coast. But we won’t do that. We just talk & whine
160 2018-03-14 23:37:15 Students in the area walk out of the classroom and an oil spill gets close to a drinking water intake for Eugene. Those stories plus the Eugene Airport is planning for the future and a new state law could help home construction. Join us for NBC16 News at 5 and 5:30 pm.#LiveOnKMTR

165 2018-03-14 23:36:35 A1. I have seen K classes where Educators set up the room to create calm, dimmed lights, big fluffy pillows in an area. Lavender essential oil in water play. #TMCtalks
166 2018-03-14 23:36:10 Is it oil or latex? If it’s latex soap and water should get it out. If it’s oil use some mineral spirits.

168 2018-03-14 23:36:02 baby, you’re taking me to get an oil change right @seffeydyrdick 
169 2018-03-14 23:35:56 190-180-181 (551).  My shots were much better today.  Poor lane conditions too; the oil pattern was made all the way down through the back of the pins, so everything snapped hard at the end.  People were 3-5 boards to the left and lots of "Brooklyn" shots.  #bowling

175 2018-03-14 23:35:17 Why no carbon tax on imported oil?
176 2018-03-14 23:34:49 “So you’ll be done by like 2 on Saturday? I can pick you up after my oil change”
“Dayuuuuum. Haven’t you ever seen March Madness? You can pick me up at like two am.” 
“Nope. Never seen it.”

179 2018-03-14 23:34:38 it's very good! i'm concerned my skin is going to turn back into a giant oil slick if i can't get a replacement bottle soon!
180 2018-03-14 23:34:32 Technology is a tool invented after you were born. A tool is something that helps people to engage with the world and people around them. If it doesn't actually help it's not a tool. It's snake oil or junk or worse.

186 2018-03-14 23:33:54 $500? That's outrageous.

I paid $300, no shipping.

Being scared of guns doesn't mean you gotta be scared of deals.
187 2018-03-14 23:33:49 Dropping a hose to an oil filter machine.  Hose landed flush with the base of the fryer, spraying 350 degree oil in my face.  Was off for a couple weeks to heal.
188 2018-03-14 23:33:44 Ohh we do have burt's bees here tlk so i should look!! We also have a big coconut oil container so i should use that, plus it smells good hehe
189 2018-03-14 23:33:39 What are you an oil spill fan?
190 2018-03-14 23:33:35 Today I paid $60 for an oil change and am currently having my tire replaced because Nashville potholes are sucking the life out of me. 

Adulting is a trap don’t fall for it.
191 2018-03-14 23:33:29 I’ve heard people use Vitamin e oil
192 2018-03-14 23:33:27 Does that mean you can shine vegetable oil with leather shoes, too?
193 2018-03-14 23:33:11 You Must Got A Oil Change LOL ?
194 2018-03-14 23:33:02 Golly that really does look like motor oil!
195 2018-03-14 23:32:50 Fresh popped in oil with kosher salt!
196 2018-03-14 23:32:25 Too bad I didn't pay anything because the government of my country uses tax money for the education of our people instead of invading half the planet for oil
197 2018-03-14 23:32:23 Can restaurants chill out on the oil when they make pasta? Damn, my stomach hurts
198 2018-03-14 23:32:19 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.

201 2018-03-14 23:31:43 Tillerson is an oil man. He has an obvious knowledge base and perspective, right or wrong. It is unimaginable that wouldn't impact his worldview and policy.
202 2018-03-14 23:31:38 Was this done by a 4th grader? You'd think with the MASSIVE amount of capital the Oil Industry has, they'd be able to better fund their shills, at least so they could hire someone better at Photoshop. Do better guys. Do better.
203 2018-03-14 23:31:32 someone needs to oil this machine....and hire some best people
204 2018-03-14 23:31:20 Cap  Now niggas about to act like I ain’t have niggas in the DP in a coma off the oil @TU_JamalW
205 2018-03-14 23:31:19 Both Allison Redford and Ed Stelmach bought votes by boosting nurses and teachers salaries. Tough to rewind. Very tough. Would love to see #ABAdvantage restored ie no debt, no deficit & lowest taxes in Canada. Highly unlikely though in a more normal (anti oil) Can biz climate  !
206 2018-03-14 23:30:45 Baby oil is such a messy thing 
207 2018-03-14 23:30:36 @cordeiro876 Control of immigration is the issue. If you don't control oil levels in engine of your car It grinds to a halt.

218 2018-03-14 23:28:22 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
219 2018-03-14 23:28:10 Yesssss I be trying to learn y'all something, eucalyptus oil too
220 2018-03-14 23:28:09 @JasonGregor your talking about not being a big deal with the 4th or 5th in Montoya deal but with our oiler fan base all we have heard this whole year is barzel, barzel, barzel. Even Beauvillie. In oil country we even care about picks that we give up. If Montoya can’t understand
221 2018-03-14 23:28:06 my face is so oily today like my whole face is just an oil field rn jfkdkc
222 2018-03-14 23:27:55 Doing what he did and stating that he is a supporter of 2A is somewhat of a contradiction , but i guess there are morons out there that will buy the snake oil you're selling .
223 2018-03-14 23:27:49 The raw Shea butter line from Shea moisture, the manuka honey hair masque for deep conditioning (works amazing, I’m going to try the entire line).. also from Shea moisture, African pride bouncy pudding (DG & Walmart), argon..castor..& olive oil, Bella curls (DG)
224 2018-03-14 23:27:45 I agree. They all got bamboozled. They lent their credibility to a charlatan and snake oil salesperson.
225 2018-03-14 23:27:43 Hope it will stop our dependance on Arab Oil & their hidden threat of black mailing
226 2018-03-14 23:27:14 Oil refinery here I come 
227 2018-03-14 23:27:03 God damn... old people and technology are like oil and water :)
228 2018-03-14 23:26:49 Same sis! Hope my young niggas can whip the oil like me @therealzah_ @Brad_Militant @donshelbo 
229 2018-03-14 23:26:49 I have also found diffusing lavender essential oil helpful at bedtime or adding a couple drops to the bath. Some kiddos are really sensitive to smells though so it would depend on the child, too.
230 2018-03-14 23:26:46 bulldog oil control!!!!
231 2018-03-14 23:26:38 Ugh, all those smells everywhere. Makes my head hurt. And, yeah, there’s an oil for that 
232 2018-03-14 23:26:29 Agreed! Mobil just backed away from Rosneft drilling oil!
233 2018-03-14 23:26:26 "Basically it’s a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization." 
Facts are there will be some redistribution. OPEC economies are based on oil exports. Cut back on oil usage and money flows towards renewables. 
Hence, redistribution.
234 2018-03-14 23:26:11 You ONLY said built you didn’t say get oil to the coast.
235 2018-03-14 23:26:01 Baby oil
236 2018-03-14 23:25:55 BS, this started Sept 11th, 2001 by Flynn, Mattis, Dunford and Kelly. Prince Alwaleed is done and so are the hardline Saudi princes. Obama was/ is a tool for the Saudi hardliners used to divide and conquer America; as well as cripple it's oil capabilities. The tide has turned.
237 2018-03-14 23:25:37 But him wearing a top means he can't apply it as needed which means... What? That he's constantly leaking preen oil? 
238 2018-03-14 23:25:33 still life of girl on the brink of her 21st spin around the sun: half naked on the couch at midnight reading about kandinsky, slurping angel hair pasta decorated with one (1) bottle-cap of olive oil and two (2) hefty dashes of pepper
239 2018-03-14 23:25:31 That's the channel with the ladies who said they never realized what Matt Laeur was doing.
240 2018-03-14 23:25:25 Yeah like bombing the shit out of countries with great Oil resources 
241 2018-03-14 23:25:24 gunakan pelembut kulit sepatu/mink oil. Minyak ini hanya digunakan pada sepatu futsal berbahan kulit untuk menjaga warna dan kondisi kulit.
242 2018-03-14 23:25:10 are you sure they aren't drilling for oil while they are down there? Dang!
243 2018-03-14 23:25:08 I would wait at least 3 days. Even then, it might irritate it. If that happens, just put some tea tree oil on it a few times a day 
244 2018-03-14 23:25:03 Why create high quality steel products for the energy industry?  Oh... I forgot...you must mean for wind and solar since you’ve made it clear you hate the oil and gas industry.  The Western  provinces should just become part of the USA, they’d get much more support
245 2018-03-14 23:25:00 Try Dawn dish soap. Especially if it’s oil based paint. Still works on latex.
246 2018-03-14 23:24:45 If Shetland were independent no oil would fall within their Economic Zone which would extend 12 Miles off shore from Sumburgh at its largest.  No oil anywhere nearby. It would be an enclave surrounded by Scotland’s EEZ - which contains all the oil.

248 2018-03-14 23:24:16 So I stopped being lazy and started to do oil treatments & deep conditioning treatments & masks ... huge difference in my hair texture
249 2018-03-14 23:24:13 TFW you start making dinner and realize there’s no olive oil in the house. Now what?
250 2018-03-14 23:24:09 The oil is a must bc it’s gonna seal in that moisture and block out that chlorine damage to the best extent possible
251 2018-03-14 23:23:49 You should get your hands on an oil cleanser or balm (a first cleanser) it gets rid of all the makeup and sunscreen and you can follow up with the creamy cleanser!
252 2018-03-14 23:23:22 Gamit ka Bio oil ata yon haha para mawala yan
253 2018-03-14 23:23:18 Hey yall if I invite u to an essential oil event on facebook DON’T LEAVE I need some free oils and yall can probably get some too
254 2018-03-14 23:22:30 Mineral oil should do the job.
255 2018-03-14 23:22:19 i have my psych exam this friday, i havent done anything and i just got fucking mint oil in my eye
256 2018-03-14 23:22:12 You also need another special license a class A license for driving a semi truck with hazardous material like oil. They're laws in place to check to see if people are driving dangerously like DUIs. If you get one your license gets suspended
257 2018-03-14 23:22:10 my chin looked like i rubbed my face on a carpet for 3 days 
i looked it up and of course conditioner & beard oil/balm, but i’m tryna see what other guys do

Palm oil ehn, we go see. 
260 2018-03-14 23:21:56 I don’t see his original post or thread, looks to me like the standard. “We will produce the oil anyway” argument. That is the problem. We can’t. The oil needs to stay in the ground. We must decrease both supply and demand. Not increase. Simple.

265 2018-03-14 23:20:25 so my dad sent me a pic of a seal by the distributor cap that was leaking oil. he couldn’t figure out what it was so he said “you wanted this car you fix it” so here i am like an idiot. i figured out what part it is but i can’t take it off to replace it /:
266 2018-03-14 23:20:24 A lot of ointments for scar erasure in my country has “rose hip oil.” Don’t know if it works effectively though
267 2018-03-14 23:20:21 If it’s water based paint just soap and hot water. If it’s oil based your screwed. Unless you want to put paint thinner in your hair!!!! Sorry man
268 2018-03-14 23:19:50 Hope she's feeling better very soon, sneak her a drop of oil when nobody is looking ;)
269 2018-03-14 23:19:37 PEPPERMINT OIL
270 2018-03-14 23:19:31 Yeah I've got a little wooden comb and a brush I can only describe as one you could also use to polish your shoes? It's pretty good for applying oil.

275 2018-03-14 23:18:31 No one gives a dry fart what the difference is between auto and semi. It’s the dumbest retort ever. A chef knows when to use butter, ghee, or oil and you don’t care and can’t tell when eating that food. Like anyone cares whether it’s semi or auto. #enough #GunReformNow
276 2018-03-14 23:18:28 Baba, levels don change ooo . We living the good life now 

Meanwhile, una no go ever see palm oil, na vegetable oil una go use cook beans laslas 
277 2018-03-14 23:18:22 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
278 2018-03-14 23:18:17 Before applying makeup, use a primer or base. It'll help prevent oil production &amp; keep your skin &amp; makeup looking fresh for hours!
279 2018-03-14 23:18:08 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
280 2018-03-14 23:18:04 Putin is spankin Rex because Mobil Oil has backed out of drilling oil with Rosneft!!

287 2018-03-14 23:17:26 What is it like being a theater major who does ‘local productions’? What is your REAL JOB?  Do you live in mom’s basement? You know the guy you are trolling is an engineer who took all the classes you purposely avoided because you were too ‘uneducated’ to understand them 
288 2018-03-14 23:16:50 Seem to be doing that as the US rushes to top producer position.  Seen oil prices lately?  Hurts worse than being banned from Disney World

Beans and bread. Chai!! We still dey look for palm oil. 
291 2018-03-14 23:16:40 What I don’t get is, when did oil and gas become such a vial thing?
Right now, this very second, every physical thing you can see, touch and eat required gas and oil to produce,manufacture and transport. Until there is a viable alternative let’s keep gas and oil flowing.
292 2018-03-14 23:16:22 Germany is in process of shutting down its nuclear power energy option . When a country consciously makes decisions to be totally dependent on Mid-east oil, Russian gas and variables of wind and solar Putin and his mafia goons have every reason to laugh

306 2018-03-14 23:15:09 We  supposedly still owed Iran for funds with after the Shau removed and the Ayatollah returned to preach death to us and terrorist propaganda  ruled.  Few deals since that hostage mess were $s for oil I thought. But never understood Obama's bad deal. End nuclear build up a lie.
307 2018-03-14 23:14:36 Ok so let’s push renewables hard then and their oil fields will be worthless!
308 2018-03-14 23:14:22 I’ve used topical CBD oil but not the psychoactive kind

314 2018-03-14 23:13:56 Do you have any ideas for Alberta other than oil? Putting our eggs in one basket again...waiting for yesterday's good times again. What happens in the bad times? All you cons did was cut public svcs. We're still paying that price.

324 2018-03-14 23:12:52 I am tried of watching the world blame Russia for everything. What started the war in the Ukraine was the west and free radio .west just wants a cold war with Russia. So west can control the oil &fuel.

344 2018-03-14 23:10:33 I’m being over obsessive with coconut oil lol I need to CHILL
345 2018-03-14 23:10:33 TRUTH! haha
346 2018-03-14 23:10:32 Just think of the manufacturing process of drilling for crude oil, transporting it, refining it, then have the government heavily tax it - and it’s STILL cheaper than bottled water. That’s my point.
347 2018-03-14 23:10:30 Hud. "My daddy thinks oil is something you stick in your salad dressing."
348 2018-03-14 23:10:29 Lmao I’m ALL for mental wellness but home girl is in the sauna rubbing ginger oil all around her 
349 2018-03-14 23:10:29 That is not an effective climate plan.  Many are starting to wonder if you are as serious about taking action on climate change as you were on electoral reform?  You must know Kinder Morgan won't end up bringing oil to Asia - it'll all end up in California, if anywhere at all.

353 2018-03-14 23:09:22 @realDonaldTrump  Real reason Tillerson was fired: Exxon backed out of oil deal with russia. Would have made putin trillions when sanctions were lifted. (which we all know you were going to try to do) Price of oil dropped and Exxon backed out. #PutinsPuppet I call bs
354 2018-03-14 23:09:21 Try coconut oil rub in and let it set for 15 min if not about to towel off do another application
355 2018-03-14 23:09:18 Interesting, how does that exponential fit approach hold up for previous energy transitions, e.g. coal uptake, oil and gas take-up, nuclear in France?
356 2018-03-14 23:09:15 Even #Trump dont believe Russia needs more land or oil.

359 2018-03-14 23:09:01 I'm not a veteran, Sir, but I'm standing with you. I am a taxpayer and we absolutely want our veterans, disabled and elderly to see the national parks for free. Their price has already been paid. I'm happy to do it. And to protect our land from the oil industry.
360 2018-03-14 23:08:48 Strange because BP has a large share in Russian oil ( which is Russian state owned ) btw .. Moscow could inflame it even more with financial war ? Makes you think . Uk and Russia and EU have a lot to lose financially all round . Tip of the iceberg , got a bad feeling .
361 2018-03-14 23:08:24 Your clothes contain oil, credit cards, automobile, your shampoo... Your house, your kids school supplies, your cellphone, your pens, your computer, you're battling whaaaaaaaat?  Sounds like fucking for virginity...
362 2018-03-14 23:07:52 Try nail polish remover...... Sometimes it works depending on the oil base of it.. Or Paint thinner.....

365 2018-03-14 23:07:32 Petro's current backup resources are not renewable. The sustainability of its value will depend on Venezuela's ability to creat wealth. With a history of corruption, oil production colapse and population exodus, Venezuela is not able to sustain Petro's value, similar to the BsF.
366 2018-03-14 23:07:28 Fossil fuels have about 30 years and it's over for them. Possibly sooner.

371 2018-03-14 23:06:39 Welcome to a world of spouting absolute rubbish because you’re on tv. Negative energy, positive energy, it’s just bunkum, snake oil or just complete nonsense (I managed to type that without swearing ).
372 2018-03-14 23:06:36 And then announces to the world she voted for Trump!
373 2018-03-14 23:06:33 "You missed the point, didn't you?"

He leaned over, whispering straight into her ear.

"Engineers do not fix -droids-. That is what -mechanics- and -maintenance- crews are for.  My team is far too important to lower themselves to plugging oil leaks."

The man stood straight-

376 2018-03-14 23:05:35 Watching a documentary on you tube about using hemp oil to cure cancer. This could cure my Mum. She’s very poorly and want to know about THC in hemp oil to reduce the spread of cancer cells.
377 2018-03-14 23:05:18 MG ... that's true but clubs like Real, Barcelona, Bayern & Juventus are pimped to ridiculous levels by Governments & the like & operate in almost total monopolies, ours are just pimped by Oil money & have domestic competition ... unfair playing field really ....
378 2018-03-14 23:05:13 Do it. Let's see if he follows through on threat to burn down FBI.
379 2018-03-14 23:05:08 My point is our Trade Balance has been continually in the red for years and is  likely to get even worse post #Brexit - as you say oil is likely to accentuate this!
380 2018-03-14 23:04:59 What's absurd is that comparison. Wheat spilled from a freighter won't affect the environment like oil spilled from a tanker of pipeline.
381 2018-03-14 23:04:56 My phone suddenly reconnected to my car during an oil change, so I hope my mechanic likes Logic's Indica Badu.
382 2018-03-14 23:04:52 Hemp oil tastes rank
383 2018-03-14 23:04:50 I agree. I lost some gains recently by listening to a tweet saying oil was about to get crushed. Sold my position and the opposite happened.
384 2018-03-14 23:04:43 OKAY @MACcosmetics might have done something with this Hint of Color lip oil. 
385 2018-03-14 23:04:42 Baby oil or Vaseline.

387 2018-03-14 23:04:37 My friends & I have been saying just that..."won't it be nice when we can snuggle under KXL on a chilly fall night?" cold metal, toxic oil, cold ground—what could be nicer? Alas, that would be a violation of my bail conditions. I'll have to leave that cozyness to other animals!
388 2018-03-14 23:04:32 Finally getting my oil changed then I’ll go get my brake light replaced. Syd needed some spoiling and my bank account some crying.

391 2018-03-14 23:03:48 Getting my oil changed, the guy comes over and tells me that some fluid was darker than it should be and he could change it for $130... but he goes “I forget what it was though”........ so you want to charge me $130 and can’t even tell me what you’re changing? Nah I’m good thx
392 2018-03-14 23:03:20 You lying cheating oil companies have clearly proven that there's no such thing as safe offshore production. There are safer, cleaner energy sources. It's time for you guys to get out of the way of progress!

Somalia were irritating at mouth of Gulf of Aden, but now subdued....it's OIL and drug crops. Control the world's energy source and heroin..big bucks. Russia isn't as powerful now..could be next
396 2018-03-14 23:03:06 I don’t feel like going out to get more oil
397 2018-03-14 23:03:05 Killers of The Flower Moon by David Grann. Exploitation of Native Americans in Ok during oil boom. FBI formed because of this situation. Good read.
398 2018-03-14 23:03:01 The entire government of the United States is run by the CIA for the bankers, oil companies etc. The entire justice system is infested with them in order to get their criminal operatives off the hook. The US government is nothing but a criminal enterprise.

420 2018-03-14 23:00:44 Latex or oil base paint? Latex should come out with soap and water and a good combing. Oil based paint, you'll probably need a stronger citrus based cleaner like Gojo, or similar.

431 2018-03-14 22:59:58 Why can't those idiots back their damned crypto with a handshake and a smile like normal people? What's this oil crap? Like we really want to trade in our crypto for a can of oil????
432 2018-03-14 22:59:44 Besides that it's only temporary. They do it all over again this fall.

434 2018-03-14 22:59:40 If its oil based try olive oill,  Vaseline or peanut butter. If not try gritty toothpaste or Dawn dish soap.
435 2018-03-14 22:59:36 However unimpressive gold trading suggests there is little investor concern about inflation or need for safe havens. Oil, copper and iron ore all rallied after the China data, & this stronger current may see regional markets perform better than their global peers @MicMcCarthy_CMC
436 2018-03-14 22:59:23 Yes, due to less oil exports so more oil imports. North sea oil is running out so is inevitable. This has exactly what to do with Brexit ?
437 2018-03-14 22:59:20 Political chess, crazy.  All you have to do is stop all economical ties with USSR aka oil
438 2018-03-14 22:59:17 trump is a Douchebag, asshole, liar, POS, Son of a Bitch, Conman, Snake Oil Salesman, Bankrupter, Chiseler, Jagoff, Idiot, Cheater, Pussy....Illegitimate "president"
439 2018-03-14 22:59:17 No, no no. The area was cordoned off, all those inside are not telling anything. They were never in any danger. This is the easiest incident to fake.
The Americans flew drones into the world trade centre to fake an attack, so they could take a country's oil.
440 2018-03-14 22:59:13 Ok. We’ll see. Feels like Arlen Specter to me.
441 2018-03-14 22:59:01 Haha  least it’s not as bad as swooshing clove oil round your mouth 
442 2018-03-14 22:58:57 Plz do. I was told to fuck off because I was helping an old lady put oil in her car and wasn't inside to sell a guy an air fresheners. 
443 2018-03-14 22:58:57 Did you consider any supposedly testosterone increasing natural compounds like colostrum, panax gensing, black seed oil, iodine, vit D3?
444 2018-03-14 22:58:47 . Oil cleanser kne curi.. bru pki kot..
Kalau nak mintak..jangan curi.. 
Kesian la kt aku ni. Nk bli skincare pon aku trpaksa puasa..
445 2018-03-14 22:58:39 Has to be oil sanctions. It’s the only card Russia has that they value and builds wealth amongst their elite. The oligarchs keep Putin in power. Hurt their bank accounts and see if they turn the screws on Putin.
446 2018-03-14 22:58:32 nagluto ko tas pagbutang na unta nako wala sa pan nabuntang kundi sa salog kay na talsikan og oil
447 2018-03-14 22:58:15 She's going to spill Trump family secrets like the Exxon Valdez oil spill. (I'll go get the borscht ready.)
448 2018-03-14 22:57:49 Paint thinner for oil base, soap and water for water based.  In 1952 I painted my brother green with house paint and cleaned him up with heating oil!
449 2018-03-14 22:57:46 I had 40 edibles of gummy bears and i got high and went to get my oil changed yesterday. Long story short i hid them so no one would find them and now i can’t find them.

453 2018-03-14 22:57:18 ooh what you drawing them on? Paper? Computer? Canvas? There's so many ways to draw them. And are you using pencil, chalk, oil paints, or are you going old school with watercolours? Can't wait to see how the drawing turns out!!
454 2018-03-14 22:57:10 Omg Stan , American and Russian oil interests are behind most of the opposition to Kinder Suprise the want to keep the Asian market to themselves it is a fact!! you are all just un witting pawns with your stupid little signs meantime Canada is a laughing stock # kindermorgan

462 2018-03-14 22:56:06 who cares about cruel and unusual punishments make oil execs drink oil
463 2018-03-14 22:56:04 Dawn works great if oil based paint
464 2018-03-14 22:55:59 My mother just said replace the oil with water in the box cake recipe “cause is the same thing” 

Wh...? 
465 2018-03-14 22:55:55 It should be water based paint,,will wash out! If you used Oil based you need a gentle paint remover sold at Lowes/ Home Depot etc But no reason to be using oil based paint at all actually!!!!!

472 2018-03-14 22:55:18 9. Why would Trumps best pal have his
Companies all over the Rosneft oil deal
Largest merger E Europe Asia 2016
Schwartzman not oil guy
Why
473 2018-03-14 22:55:16 4) not currently one of the schools under FBI scrutiny

5) has a decent recruiting class coming in

6) UCLA isn’t exactly Texas A&M, which is flushed with oil money, we pay Alford 4th highest salary in the Pac-12

7) bought himself an extra year with last year’s performance.
474 2018-03-14 22:54:57 Most Paints are Latex and Water will clean it up. If it is Oil Based, Mineral Spirits will clean it .
475 2018-03-14 22:54:56 If you know the issues, you know the solutions.. If it's about Xray Machines, buy them. Don't count on a single way to send the Oil in Iran, it would be to easy to make your partnership to fail.
476 2018-03-14 22:54:56 Still not buying the latest Russia nonsense, frankly it screams of ‘weapons of mass destruction’ to me. Elites want Russian oil, gas etc
477 2018-03-14 22:54:53 If it’s latex just get a shower. If it’s oil base, probably paint thinner. Good luck  !

479 2018-03-14 22:54:46 Oil or latex/acrylic?

481 2018-03-14 22:54:43 yeah the no-shampoo hair care technique is used by black people all the time because afro and curly hair doesn’t take to sulphates as we need to retain oil rather than wash it away
482 2018-03-14 22:54:37 Pretty sure this was a House of Cards episode.
483 2018-03-14 22:54:30 The Palestinians are 100% correct, it is another one of The USA's and the Israelis their dirty scam politics, games and frames, if there would be oil or gold in the Palestinian soil, they would have murdered all Palestinians already!
484 2018-03-14 22:54:22 frying shit is so scary especially when the oil starts to wild out
485 2018-03-14 22:54:17 So why are not Muslim countries looking after their own?. They make billions per week with oil sales, and yet somehow it becomes our problem. We have a 500 billion debt, 121,000 homeless people over 55. Focus on fixing Australia's problems instead of lecturing us.
486 2018-03-14 22:54:15 Strudwick  “We got oil in Edmonton.. Edmonton Oilers. There have probably been some fires in Calgary... Calgary flames” Doesn’t understand why Toronto is called Raptors
487 2018-03-14 22:54:12 Doesnt matter without oil daddy mansour you would be in league 2
488 2018-03-14 22:53:57 It's another oil Imma have to send you a pic of. That shit got my beard and side burns to come in
489 2018-03-14 22:53:55 Minni: "I have a headache Devonia"
Me: "Oh girl all you need is some lwil maskriti"
Minni: *reaches over and grabs bottle full of said oil* yeah you right you right *proceeds to rub drops on forehead*

490 2018-03-14 22:53:53 Should’ve had him take some pics after massaging my titties with oil earlier today
491 2018-03-14 22:53:46 Even putting aside their blatant hypocrisy, do none of them know that Shaq has a doctorate in Education and is also a reserve police officer (who is planning on running for sheriff in 2020)?

496 2018-03-14 22:53:06 Haha. I had to empty mine. Daily oil banking is a must!
497 2018-03-14 22:53:03 Oil or water base?
498 2018-03-14 22:52:48 He's all about oil.  Don't let him fool you. He's just smarter than Trump
499 2018-03-14 22:52:41 Is it latex or oil base

501 2018-03-14 22:52:29 .@Prevagen no one cares your snake oil is derived from mashed up jellyfish.  They are the stupidest animals on planet Earth.  It is not something to brag about.
502 2018-03-14 22:52:24 Try something oil based like Dr. Bronner's liquid castile soap.
503 2018-03-14 22:52:20 Has the cannabis law come into effect already. The only way oil investors will start seeing any upward change is when the federal government gets off it ass and gets a few pipelines built.
504 2018-03-14 22:52:19 Blah and assuming you know what you’re talking about; you’re okay with a liar?
505 2018-03-14 22:52:12 I don’t have eggs, sesame oil, or green onions but tonight’s dinner will still be #DirtyRamen because, well, I’m a filthy human being and my bowls follow suit

511 2018-03-14 22:50:53 With a recent bout with sinus issues I discovered Peppermint Essential oil as a inhaler that is clearing up my sinuses without dangerous drugs. Just put two drops on a tissue and hold it under your nose.

526 2018-03-14 22:49:30 The two bowling alleys are so different. Today the Blue Ridge lanes are real wood and the oil on lanes reacts then the oil on the artificial wood in Canton. I like the lanes tomorrow  way better! More room no steps to trip on and pull a Hillary.

535 2018-03-14 22:48:19 Pruitt will retaliate. He's a pissy, secretive little b*tch, who makes a hell of a lot more than his salary from catering to oil & mineral interests. If deprived, he might give Mueller greater latitude, especially if Pence promises him his old job when Trump is impeached.
536 2018-03-14 22:48:17 Jihadis can be weakened by weakening or stopping their support from Pakistan & the Gulf oil states That may be happening (see MBS in Saudi Arabia), but won’t know for a while if any real difference. Fracking and Iran threat incentivize gulf states to work with us on this.
537 2018-03-14 22:48:14 NRA budget has nothing on the military complex. Largest economy in the world. Passing next drugs legal and illegal - then oil -then food followed by booze. Bullets will go off and babies will die only question is the stats. You trust your govt that much?

541 2018-03-14 22:47:55 So I really need to point out that considering “data is the new oil” requires serious consideration of the ethical consequences of data collection and storage, especially in a cultural context that does not consider those consequences by default.  #umbrellarlive

553 2018-03-14 22:46:02 It's ironic that the only people who still believe #Hillary's faux feminist nonsense are Indians in India. Once they get wise to her, too, she is going to have to peddle her snake oil to pre-schoolers.
554 2018-03-14 22:45:57 Thats my cue! Haha. “Dirty Ramen” is a childhood staple of mine that Chris is now addicted to. Its basically a packet of ramen, with two eggs dropped in while its boiling, a lot of sesame oil, and green onions on top. Freaking delicious. 
555 2018-03-14 22:45:44 Some desperate moron from the provincial NDP somehow texted me trying to get Notley credit for fighting for Alberta oil workers.

568 2018-03-14 22:44:25 I'm a united fan,but I hv made a decision never to watch our match again till next season InshaAllah, maybe they might hv sacked the clown of a coach by then.
569 2018-03-14 22:44:18 Well for this I have no reply 
570 2018-03-14 22:44:01 Personally I can’t see Jose changing his management style to suit United’s supposed playing style, he is a successful manager in his own right with that style, time will tell if it is an oil and water scenario, player purchase next season will be crucial.
571 2018-03-14 22:43:34 @DarkAngelC69 Come tonight with oil, girl.....

578 2018-03-14 22:42:57 Just chill and enjoy the remaining La liga.
579 2018-03-14 22:42:55 Unless they give you sacks of cash to your family, expensive gifts and favors from such as the Saudi Royals. USA pays nearly $1 Trillion/year to the Saudis in a obvious, overt unfair price rigging of the Saudi Oil exports to America. Talking about blind eyes!
580 2018-03-14 22:42:38 This pink eco gel just fucked up my life  needa buy the olive oil quick !!!
581 2018-03-14 22:42:35 I need streamers

I’m building an empire here so oil up and slip in my DMs!
582 2018-03-14 22:42:30 Sorry for the fragmented tweets. Yeah I was in there last Saturday  and the oil didn't smell burned...but then again I only changed the oil a couple weeks ago
583 2018-03-14 22:42:15 Shell had debt problems after paying too much for untimely BG Group group acquisition and RDS got into the oil sands to begin with (acquired Shell Canada) because it had overstated reserves (by a lot) and had to do a fix.
584 2018-03-14 22:42:07 A bloke called Keynes ,during a recession caused by external shocks (oil price rises etc ), public spending is allowed to rise as a proportion of N.I.,,so that aggregate demand doesn't collapse ,& trigger a large rise in unemployment,then brought back to the pre recession level.?
585 2018-03-14 22:42:03 Yeahh there are casualties.. The target was a barrack very close to the university, so stray bullets and rocket hits the school. 
586 2018-03-14 22:41:59 eating ur shit baking is a throat workout please if ur not gonna use butter oil that shit up lord

589 2018-03-14 22:41:42 I bet every one of them love every stupid thing that comes out of LeBron’s mouth.
590 2018-03-14 22:41:41 "Whats the first ingredient of Risotto?"

"Its rice you fucking pillock!"
591 2018-03-14 22:41:32 In the market for a new car but rethinking with Acura as the new TLX and MDX may have the same oil burning issues.
592 2018-03-14 22:41:27 PROBLEM: Ppl are dying from guns...
SOLUTION: Everyone should have guns....

USA bombs the hell out of (insert non ally with oil reserve/natural resource)

Rationale: They have weapons....they can't have those lol.
593 2018-03-14 22:41:24 One day I asked my mother for bio oil to clear stretch marks..this woman stood and asked me if the stretch marks were taking taxes from me,that’s why I want to clear them
594 2018-03-14 22:41:18 Put this n pipe
Ru hacked emails
Leading Blockade 
Ru had Qatar main buyer
In Rosneft oil deal
But, believed had buyback P
Qatar denied one
595 2018-03-14 22:41:15 Were you alive during the 6 day war? I don't believe the Golan heights has any oil but I do know that the Golan heights are part of Israel's territory now.
596 2018-03-14 22:41:00 Hay heridas que con el tiempo no se cura
597 2018-03-14 22:40:43 seal the end grain with oil/lacquer - best to try and sit timber up on something rather than down. maybe pave a boarder?
598 2018-03-14 22:40:41 All greased up in bio oil cause I read it’s anti aging 
599 2018-03-14 22:40:30 Not a farmer just a mechanic but I feel your pain especially if it’s burnt gear oil

601 2018-03-14 22:40:22 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together.

602 2018-03-14 22:40:16 All the different brands of tortilla chips I've tasted have the same three ingredients of corn, oil and salt, and yet they all taste completely different. How?
603 2018-03-14 22:40:14 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
604 2018-03-14 22:39:36 Get yourself some beard oil and beard shampoo.
605 2018-03-14 22:39:25 My skin feels TOOO good why didn't anyone tell me oil fucking works omg...
606 2018-03-14 22:39:24 When your bitches oil your body for a dick appointment  solid as fuck
607 2018-03-14 22:39:09 I will say, maybe the Dr. wasn't off on the 3 hours.  After 2 hours I was in SOOO much pain. At the end of 3 hours I was happy to be leaving and am now rubbing CBD oil on my neck and shoulders and am going to use the heating pad.
608 2018-03-14 22:39:08 Excellent!
Keep your partner at arms length, no one likes to discuss their emotions after all.
Boil all your vegetables.
There is never a reason to change your oil, just ignore the light on your dash.
609 2018-03-14 22:39:02 This hot oil treatment is feeling amazing in my hair.
610 2018-03-14 22:39:01 財務省改革を完遂した暁には、或いは首相交代もありかもわからん。が、今やったところで前世代同様の首のすげ替えにしかならんよ
611 2018-03-14 22:38:56 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
612 2018-03-14 22:38:48 Allah tsinewa study din.
613 2018-03-14 22:38:46 There is no great shame in Canada not maximizing at this time. Oil is going to be needed for generations. Even after all the auto industry has switched to electric, which I do not see happening as fast as some would like, oil is going to be needed. Save for the future
614 2018-03-14 22:38:39 So you think it's right for the US to partition Syria, east of the Euphrates so it can help itself to Syria's oil fields?
615 2018-03-14 22:38:38 Stator breaking up,then, is it charging? does the oil smell burned? Take the cover off is the best option, a visual is the only way to find out
616 2018-03-14 22:38:29 We help Saudi  arabia we buy their oil. Something wrong with this picture. These people hate canada right butts
617 2018-03-14 22:38:21 Regulations may hamper businesses like coal & oil to some extent but no regulations leads to a polluted environment, bad health of the general population ensuring they're not in the fit to work in any industry at all.
618 2018-03-14 22:38:19 Finally bought Jamaican Castor Oil lets see if I get some beard growth within a month.

620 2018-03-14 22:37:51 Try oil of oregano.
621 2018-03-14 22:37:39 Folks, please.  Tillerson was hired specifically to do big oil business in Russia.  The minute the Exxon-Mobil/Gazprom deal was done, so was Rex. Remember, he called 45 a "fucking moron" and got away with it.
622 2018-03-14 22:37:29 @AriMelber You keep having Gaetz in your show and I’ll keep changing the channel.  He is one of the snakes  in the snake oil Trump continues to peddle!
623 2018-03-14 22:37:29 moths and oil burners are a bad combo
624 2018-03-14 22:37:26 tanga ni kuya kevin pinapainom sakin yung oil dine, tas kulang lang daw ako sa selfie para gumaling 
625 2018-03-14 22:37:18 Pemerintah harus merumuskan strategi bagaimana mengisolasi pertumbuhan ekonomi dari pengaruh volatilitas harga minyak mentah.Crude oil sbg bahan baku penghasil bbm harus digantikan dg sumber lain dan terus mengembangkan energy baru n terbarukan.
626 2018-03-14 22:37:03 Russia is still sending tanker after tanker of oil and weapons to North Korea, no sanctions for that either? Again I wonder why not? Doesn’t matter buddy they’re all getting voted out midterms and beyond so your arguments mean nothing to anyone except the 30 % that support him
627 2018-03-14 22:36:59 I'm still not entirely sure still but I think the moth flew through a candle that I had lit for an oil burner & then set the oil on fire
628 2018-03-14 22:36:58 How many women do you find working as floor hands on oil rigs?
629 2018-03-14 22:36:41 Never been more excited to get new windshield wipers and a oil change 
630 2018-03-14 22:36:10 My skin care routine:
-cleanser

-chemical exfoliator 
-moisturizer
-oil
-telling myself that I'm the prettiest girl on the whole planet

633 2018-03-14 22:35:45 Isn't oil extraction also built on the same lack of ethics?
634 2018-03-14 22:35:42 This guy Doug Little wants to shut down the Oil Sands project? Economic suicide for AB.
635 2018-03-14 22:35:42 Koh a banza Messi ya dinka mishi wando. But almost everyone guessed the right outcome of the match. Nigerian village people did the goalkeeper 
636 2018-03-14 22:35:33 The French will let the US and UK get into another mess in the MIddle East then come in and demand territory and oil, along with their Turkish friends. #Newsnight
637 2018-03-14 22:35:24 coconut oil makes me so soft omg

640 2018-03-14 22:35:03 Shame on @SecretaryZinke. I bet his children have no problem paying fees to get into National Parks - oh, wait - they get in for free. Zinke seems to believe Nat’l Parks are simply a hindrance to oil drilling and mineral mining. Well, at least his kids will get to see them....
641 2018-03-14 22:35:00 Unless it's Barkov. In which case they're changing his oil and upgrading some firmware.
642 2018-03-14 22:34:49 Selling off our National parks to oil drilling is criminal.
643 2018-03-14 22:34:39 Israel is not going into Syria for anything other than knocking out threats. Syria doesn't have any more oil than Jordan has. US will defend Israel. Iran wants to be THE power in the middle east. They want to control all that oil. That is why the Saudi's are beefing up.
644 2018-03-14 22:34:27 @oprah @jimcarrey @rwitherspoon My Dad would tell me how my Uncle Vance 'changed the oil on that Chrysler New Yorker Steve McGrath & I were SUPPOSED TO BUY.  Flat out lie!  Steve McGrath took MY money & ran! I never got that Chrysler New Yorker. Pauline would buy a Chrysler 300.
645 2018-03-14 22:34:24 Oil money yes
646 2018-03-14 22:34:21 I also have things to say about the collection of data and “data is the new oil” is deeply, deeply toxic and built on the intrinsic and horrifying lack of ethics within the technology sphere.
647 2018-03-14 22:34:11 "It's important to not be uniquely beholden to the American market for our oil," PMJT says in support of Trans Mountain. "We're going to get our resources to market, safely, securely and we're going to create new markets for it across the Pacific." $TMX #cdnpoli
648 2018-03-14 22:33:59 coconut oil
649 2018-03-14 22:33:57 Neoconservatives have been terrible for our economy since the 80’s and it’s by no accident; it’s because they only care about the oil lobby, the military, and Wall Street oligarchs. Our economy will worsen under Trump once we begin his fiscal years
650 2018-03-14 22:33:36 He heard that they have neither coal nor oil over there at VA. And he loves both because they're from God
651 2018-03-14 22:33:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
652 2018-03-14 22:33:32 I bet her cooch smell like fish oil pills
653 2018-03-14 22:33:17 Getting my oil changed at a new spot and when I told the guys my first name they immediately hit me with the “OOOH YEAAAH”. Never gets old.
654 2018-03-14 22:33:10 I drenched myself in coconut oil so I might love myself.
655 2018-03-14 22:33:07 I know my body can’t absorb it, but sometimes I take TWO fish oil capsules at the same time IDGAF. #40s #ThugLife
656 2018-03-14 22:32:40 Hope he sells his oil stocks first.
657 2018-03-14 22:32:34 Standard Time Yes. Daylight saving time is year round is STUPID. IN DEAD OF WINTER SUNRISE AFTER 8AM. No good for kids going to school. Nixon did it for oil embargo. Senate has more important work.
658 2018-03-14 22:32:33 I just saw a lot of people acting like all he did was play basketball.
659 2018-03-14 22:32:31 lol good for her to game these fools
660 2018-03-14 22:32:24 I have multiple candles and oil diffusers going plus the door open to get rid of the smell 
661 2018-03-14 22:32:21 Probably finna go get a hoagie  extra oil please honey

664 2018-03-14 22:31:51 hopefully this oil comes off 
665 2018-03-14 22:31:44 If the house has oil not much you can do about it. Oil is cheap atm but could rocket as gas espically with the whole Russia thing, u should b able to view the epc of any property for rent or sale ask for full document it will tell you how much it costs to heat the house annually
666 2018-03-14 22:31:42 *naghanda ng oil*
667 2018-03-14 22:31:16 This is the genius who said BP oil spill is no big deal because "salt water is tough stuff"
668 2018-03-14 22:31:14 Lmao yes, especially in areas that is growing like your tits or stomach it’s stretching use vitamin E oil works wonders
669 2018-03-14 22:31:10 Has anyone used bio oil and it actually worked? It’s so much money and effort for something I’m not at all convinced is effective. 
670 2018-03-14 22:30:44 OIL DIFF: 4.01 -> 4.05
671 2018-03-14 22:30:41 Yummy! Nut butter, @nutiva coconut oil, @purelyelizabeth superfood oatmeal, @gardenofliferaw protein & greens, and non-dairy chips.
672 2018-03-14 22:30:41 Happy Wax Wednesday! We've got some beautiful new oil in from ECC today and its already moving quick! Come enjoy $5 off any gram in store!
673 2018-03-14 22:30:37 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
674 2018-03-14 22:30:15 Wasn’t everyone claiming Tillerson was a Russian hack? That he was in bed with all the Russian oil executives? That’s what I remember at least. And now you’re all mad that he got fired? How backassward can someone be?
675 2018-03-14 22:30:14 1910 – Lakeview Gusher, the largest U.S. oil well gusher near Bakersfield, California, vented to atmosphere
676 2018-03-14 22:29:53 Anyone selling or know someone who got oil pens or oil on them up for grabs ?
677 2018-03-14 22:29:25 Lol but seriously he is,even Chelsea fans agree to this submission
678 2018-03-14 22:28:56 Before my kids could get their license they had several tasks to pass: change a tire, change oil, check fluids, jump a battery.  My girl even took auto mechanics!
679 2018-03-14 22:28:50 Just to highlight that Norway never gives incentive to buy cars, offer free recharged because they are 6mil people with renewable overproduction, and export of oil. Offer free highway and parking because of the benefit of the royalties..so is not easy to replicate.
680 2018-03-14 22:28:41 Good Morning!

684 2018-03-14 22:28:08 i'm eating the most average meal ever which is gluten free pasta with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil and some dairy/soy/gluten free cheese and ken's genuinely out here pretending it's the best thing ever and that's the kind of support i deserve
685 2018-03-14 22:28:07 Watercolor is the most difficult medium I've ever tried. Acrylic, gouache, and oil all have the benefit of opaque layering
686 2018-03-14 22:28:04 I’m going to see a house that’s oil heating tomorrow- always had gas in any other property I’ve had. Is it the full responsibility of the tenant to manage the oil heating or does the landlord have some input ?
687 2018-03-14 22:28:02 I think I got a throat infection and I can’t breathe through my noise so I’ve put olbas oil everywhere in my room and on my pjs 
688 2018-03-14 22:27:58 Yes, but only in clove oil
689 2018-03-14 22:27:53 I was just questioning my sanity while pouring linseed oil onto a rag and thence onto a bat. I don’t remember having to do that with rugby gear.
690 2018-03-14 22:27:43 I really wish I could’ve spent that $80 on something else rather than an oil change 
691 2018-03-14 22:27:36 今回の件、一番恐ろしいのは、野党の対応が政局的にみれば最適ではないかと言うところ。このまま解散まで持っていければ、気をみて野合、政党ロンダで十分議席伸ばせる。過半数とれなくても永遠と文章改竄疑惑でごねられる。
あなおそろしや
692 2018-03-14 22:27:33 Chelsea be beans 7gh, one spoon of gari, no palm oil and 90pesewas plantain
693 2018-03-14 22:27:10 Some of the oil gets soaked up by the container, like how a paper bag absorbs oil from tortilla chips
694 2018-03-14 22:26:26 The jumps are 28 over the 35 most of it is 28 with a few 22 and 15. She bends so easy to don't need much weight behind it to be fair think plenty of oil is key to the larger stuff
695 2018-03-14 22:26:01 Funny how he was our friend against the infidel Iran when we armed him and scorned the left-wing loonies who opposed his genocides, as against the Marsh Arabs. But then he threatened our oil.

700 2018-03-14 22:25:03 Girl. You should've asked me first. Plus it separates all the fuCKING TIME AND IT SUCKS AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE POWDERED PEANUTS MIXED WITH OIL
701 2018-03-14 22:25:00 Haha, saw that on my way home. Looks like someone forgot that cars require oil!
702 2018-03-14 22:24:47 Thanks. The ammo for it will be here tomorrow. I need to clean and oil it first though.

706 2018-03-14 22:24:31 o h b o y
707 2018-03-14 22:24:29 More oil is NOT the needed! Oil is already cheap and more supply will just crippled the price recovery. Why do you think the Saudies are selling all their oil holdings to the public via the worlds biggest IPO?

713 2018-03-14 22:23:39 Take Coconut Oil, 1 tablespoon or so,
swish, swallow, lowers appetite,

Keeps ya looking pretty, along with broccoli, health
714 2018-03-14 22:23:35 @em_rabson did you rem this
715 2018-03-14 22:23:32 venezuela nationalized the oil industry to divest parasites
we're gonna have to nationalize silicon valley
716 2018-03-14 22:23:29 New shampoo for my hair extensions, went for @LOrealParisUK  Elvive extradinary oil low shampoo as all the reviews are really good, my hair feels lovely wet, but as soon as I dry it, it seems to leave a residue making my hair look greasy and unwashed, am I doing something wrong?
717 2018-03-14 22:23:26 Can we have one called Keep the Monsters At Bay and it'll be full of all ki ds of things like salt, "silver" (glitter?), whatever lovely smell Holy Oil mift be (myrrh?)... Double points if you fill your bath with holy water to use it. ^_^
718 2018-03-14 22:23:11 Yeah yoghurt can help. Also lightly massage your belly button with some warm oil in circular motion
719 2018-03-14 22:23:04 Looks like a hostel though, did they infiltrate, and were casualties recorded?
720 2018-03-14 22:22:55 Shaq spent time in Law Enforcement. He shows up for at least 1 LSU Football game a year and spends time taking photos with all the officers there.
721 2018-03-14 22:22:35 About blackmail to keep that secret (has to more than hookers peeing on Obama's hotel bed) and a deal to get party of the oil $$$ if he'd lift Sanctions and help Russia break up nato.  Def believe it's been planned for a few years. 2/2
722 2018-03-14 22:22:23 #Stress is one of the leading causes of illness and death. #CBD oil can help you relax and improve your quality of life. Don't rely on pharma. Choose canna. #MedicalCannabis
723 2018-03-14 22:22:18 I love people oil was
724 2018-03-14 22:21:48 色合いが僕好みなのだわ
725 2018-03-14 22:21:44 Guy who changed my oil today had no teeth and was wearing a cowboy hat. @tomsegura would be losing his mind right now, what an animal.
726 2018-03-14 22:21:32 I spilt the arrow oil on the boot of my car and that really does make everything smell of furniture polish 
727 2018-03-14 22:21:25 How much of the #bitumen are we processing in #Canada? Seems the companies will invest in #pipelines but not refineries. Also, do you know what % of oil needs goes to transport versus heating?  I think the change to electric cars and public transportation will happen faster.
728 2018-03-14 22:21:20 Will blimpleggers feature time charts for fermenting peanut oil?
729 2018-03-14 22:21:19 Should also say though, if it comes down to the Flames needing to beat the Oilers to edge the Ducks out, I'm cheering for the Oil. It's still a rivalry :).

731 2018-03-14 22:20:57 Coconut oil.... avocado... mayonnaise...eggs..greek yogurt
732 2018-03-14 22:20:48 Deep breathing, a run, warm bath, CBD oil (won't make you high), and sometimes a chat with a friend or loved one helps too.  Hope you feel better soon.
733 2018-03-14 22:20:31 Looks like there's very little oil anywhere offshore, except for the Gulf. The oil companies don't care about drilling today, they want to lock in the *right* to drill tomorrow or 50 years from now, if it comes to that. Let's make sure it never comes to that! Use alternatives.
734 2018-03-14 22:20:20 
735 2018-03-14 22:19:43 I wonder if @ExxonMobil_EU has some financial stake/interest in that Iran deal. Maybe trying to import/take@control of Iran’s oil surplus.
736 2018-03-14 22:19:35 Misrepresentation/ lying? He's just one guy. He will vote with the party or be made irrelevant by the party.
737 2018-03-14 22:19:33 I bought this body oil to complement moisturizer and honestly this shit is incredible. My skin has never felt more soft and smooth
738 2018-03-14 22:19:27 The oil change guy was flirting with me heavily and he gave me a coupon for my oil change and a token for a free car wash.
739 2018-03-14 22:19:19 Wonder if she "saved the blue dress".

740 2018-03-14 22:19:00 Called my dad to ask how to put windshield wiper fluid in my car bc it seemed way too simple and he told me to not put it in the oil spot

743 2018-03-14 22:18:39 As long as the grime is thematic, that's what I say. I once accidentally dripped cooking oil on the box lid of Food Chain Magnate. The amount of dirt, dust and soot on the floor of my kitchen is probably in keeping with a train game.
744 2018-03-14 22:18:37 hahahah. I get Oil all the time.
745 2018-03-14 22:18:19 Follow the oil money, but I can tell you that Trump has increased the notoriously inaccurate drone strikes that kill innocent civilians by 400% though.
746 2018-03-14 22:18:00 I tried making brownies today & we didn't have an egg so I thought "what does one egg really do for brownies" so I made them anyway. I checked up on them in the oven & IT WAS ALL BURNT AND OIL WAS POOLED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. ONE EGG MAKES A DIFFERENCE, GUYS DONT SKIP INGREDIENTS
747 2018-03-14 22:17:59 My “oh h*ck” sticker got a big thumbs up at the dealership during an oil change last week.
748 2018-03-14 22:17:52 Slowly getting back into the habit of applying beard oil both morning and night. About time too bc both my beard and skin have been suffering from the neglect.
749 2018-03-14 22:17:36 That is because Donald Trump is a snake oil salesman and the people who wanted to give him a chance are realizing he sold them a stack of phonies. They won’t be fooled twice.
750 2018-03-14 22:17:11 Get the pipelines built and oil off the rail lines!!!

752 2018-03-14 22:16:55 Go Pro lenses-Drone optics--all need regular #opticalcleaning to maintain the best conditions for optimum imaging. Nothing better than #ROR to do the job-- the only Residual Oil Remover that gets that grimy residue off lens surfaces--the difference is "CLEAR"!!!
753 2018-03-14 22:16:54 Yes, yes she is.
754 2018-03-14 22:16:49 People don't like a proxy of an oil giant, but the silver lining was that he had some experience in his area, unlike some of the other people in the admin. He is now replaced with a hawk. Capice?
755 2018-03-14 22:16:48 Lol stock is up 5 bucks today - this conservative boycott is almost as embarrassing a liberals boycotting oil

768 2018-03-14 22:14:39 I live by Wild Growth Oil, many people say it just makes their hair thicker, but I’ve seen great length retention from this product! This may sound crazy, but I only do my hair twice a week and that has made my hair grow as well. As far as products I only use Aussie & Curls!
769 2018-03-14 22:14:37 My mum has had a lot of pain with her hip operations.  Try cbd cannabis oil it's been really helpfull .doesn't get you high it just helps with inflammation.

781 2018-03-14 22:11:28 Its because he doesn't really care to run a country. More concerned about taking vacations and playing dress up. He proved he doesn't care about Canadian people when oil crashed and thousands and thousands were out of work. Canada is not his #1 priority.

791 2018-03-14 22:10:49 I disagree,@atiku has no oil block and his life isn't like that of Alakija every one has his own story.Also it's not a crime for you to own an oil block.Go to NNPCs website check the requirements and see if you can.
792 2018-03-14 22:10:43 You ever get the slight urge to dip your nuts on hot oil? 
793 2018-03-14 22:10:35 Can someone please tell me how people think cooking good food is difficult and expensive. I’ve just roasted carrots, parsnips, onion, pepper and tomatoes in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and mixed with with bulgar wheat

800 2018-03-14 22:09:51 I got lazy so I had to grind for hours today in Azur Lane to get that damned Dork of York, had to dig through the sacred mailbox stash to have enough oil for the job.

804 2018-03-14 22:08:57 It is our (humans) fault. We are lazy,  we should ban plastic. However, there is a lot of stuff made with plastic. Using corn oil or another petroleum product, so it decomposes easily and completely, is probably the answer. We need solutions, not slander. that’s all I was saying.
805 2018-03-14 22:08:56 Yes to the boxes.  It has a cowl at the front bottom covering the oil filter already. I’ll probably wait and see on more.
806 2018-03-14 22:08:53 I got given some beard oil and now you can see my facial hair from >2 feet away. And I smell of wood.
807 2018-03-14 22:08:50 Use some coconut oil before bed and take some biotin 
808 2018-03-14 22:08:37 Wtf wrong with the United bus they need to invest in a mechanic sum cheap oil or something.

810 2018-03-14 22:07:49 From my experience collaborating with a big oil company it should not be possible to exchange data between a secure system and a normal system. The port that you plug a stick drive in should be disabled on a classified system. No data can be downloaded from the secure system.

823 2018-03-14 22:05:55 HAHAHA! Yes, they do like to self-change their oil. Especially mine since it dumps oil out the breather when inverted or knife-edge. Acro pilots keep a water bottle on the breather or we'd have oil puddles in the hangar.
824 2018-03-14 22:05:51 Top tip: when searching for a great place to eat near work, ask the guy with a bottle of Olive Oil on his desk.

859 2018-03-14 22:02:46 I use a scrubber every day in the shower and apply coconut oil while still wet. Not total prevention but it keeps serious cracks from forming.
860 2018-03-14 22:02:40 Birchcliff will focus on the drilling of crude oil wells in Gordondale and a  combination of liquids-rich and natural gas wells in Pouce Coupe to take  advantage of the recently improved prices for oil and NGLs. Not surprised by the change in strategy by this #NatGas play. $BIR

863 2018-03-14 22:02:27 for me, when it comes to facial cleanser, just find low ph & gentle cleanser that good enough to clean dirt & oil.

871 2018-03-14 22:01:47 野党側としては政府、与党内閣側の出してくる文書が信用ならないままの方がやりやすいから論点をずらしているのではないかと勘ぐってしまう。
内閣総辞職なんかしたって、お前のところは以前も文書改竄したではないか、信用のおける(自分達の都合のよい)文書をもってこいと言えてしまう
872 2018-03-14 22:01:33 Been quite due to important stream where do I start. Hats off to the 10 outfield player for nominal second half. How we not scored is unbelievable. Courtios cost us that game 2 nut megs  #UpTheChels #CFC #BARCHE #KTBFFH

Disagree with you regarding flying United. I would pay additional $20-$50 to fly Delta/AA (prefer SW).
That said, agree the dog thing will happen again.  Oil is cheap too, perfect time/cost to road trip as an option...provided not driving to NE Bombogenesis #3
883 2018-03-14 21:59:42  What’s that dark purple? Naggaroth Night? With Nuln Oil?
884 2018-03-14 21:59:18 与野党、左右翼関係ないはずなんだ。しかして、現在は首相個人の改竄問題に矮小化されている。原因究明すらまともに進まない状態。なぜか
885 2018-03-14 21:59:13 I wish, but largely no. Not flying. Biggest reason: would you be ok with everyone flying over you, your kids, your house? Are you suuuuuure they got the hubcap on tight? Little oil leak action. Sky-littering..

889 2018-03-14 21:58:40 When you take your car to get an oil change and they make you aware of 50000 other problems with your old ass car  wow my life is a joke
890 2018-03-14 21:58:39 That doth definitely merit further investigation! We already repented from the time the oil storage tank leaked. It unleashed the Environment Agency and all hell broke loose. Oh how we wailed & gnashed our teeth then!
891 2018-03-14 21:58:36 Add Turkey, America and their proxies, kissinger, soros, Israel, France, big pharma to the list. what abt the millions of barrels of syrian oil transported to Turkey under the watch of the US for a year, war profiteers are as thick as thieves. Banks rig the system in their favour
892 2018-03-14 21:58:22 You can't mix oil and water. That's the problem.
893 2018-03-14 21:58:18 @realDonaldTrump do something for the people. How about having one of your staffers explain a food desert.?Americans are starving. Americans are priced out of homes and are living on the street. You can’t eat airplanes, oil or guns. Your support for these clowns show us your
894 2018-03-14 21:58:13 Make sure to pick a consistent day to apply coconut oil and moisturizer to your hair each week! Make sure you drink at least 3 bottles of water daily!

896 2018-03-14 21:58:08 Today's oil tankers dwarf the Queen Mary.
897 2018-03-14 21:58:04 I tend to think of these things as "self changing oil systems"
898 2018-03-14 21:57:58 where's the video of the guy tryin 2 replicate dabin & just putting a shit ton of oil in his hair
899 2018-03-14 21:57:56 It's great! Just onions, olive oil, salt and a bit of citric acid. Made in #Spain
900 2018-03-14 21:57:46 I've just sent the epilog to the US edition of my book, that @chelseagreen publishing should release in September: that final step of a long endeavour. Exhausted and thrilled, I am.
901 2018-03-14 21:57:45 It had been a long day for Jacob. He leaned back in his chair behind his desk to stretch. What was supposed to be a simple oil change turned into a battery change, and air filter being replaced. And on top of that, Quil and Embry thought it would be a  {@PoisonedDevour}~

904 2018-03-14 21:57:16 財務省文章改竄疑惑問題、本来は「行政府の文章が組織的に改竄され、見逃されていた」という点が問題なんではないか。以降以前、国の文書が信用できなくなるという大問題。だから、今回の原因究明と、他の改竄がないか実態調査、再発防止を早急に行わないといけないはず

906 2018-03-14 21:57:11 Zamfara the 1st state that passed Shariah into law collect while Lagos that contributes over 70% was not given 13% derivation like SS States on oil.
I wonder what likes of @femigbaja @SenGbengaAshafa are doing at NASS.
907 2018-03-14 21:57:09 And helping the middle class by retraining oil/coal/natural gas workers to make solar panels and/or get jobs fixing infrastructure.  Our own government can use US steel to fix bridges & railways.  How about bullet trains too!  Easier than tariffs. @realDonaldTrump
908 2018-03-14 21:57:08 You must mean Obama- he gave away the store to his buddy Putin, including 20% of our needed Uranium, oil rich lands in Alaska, a pass on taking over the Ukraine, etc., Poland’s anti-missile Defense, etc etc
909 2018-03-14 21:57:03 Only the stupid EU allowed themselves to be dependant on Russian oil. How idiotic are they ?
910 2018-03-14 21:56:51 Boil some water, drop some eucalyptus and lavender oil in it, put a towel over your head and just breathe that stuff in! It’ll help relax your vocal chords and your mind

913 2018-03-14 21:56:20 Why would an environmental protector need this other than to call up his oil & gas cronies and arrange shady corrupt deals and kick-backs!?!?

Environmental protection is not a top secret cloak & dagger activity.
914 2018-03-14 21:56:15 Yes ma’am took my car in for an oil change and the mechanic Pat told me my car totaled, something about a leaky spark tube

940 2018-03-14 21:52:24 Thank you sir. I have discussed this with my doctors and they recommend creel or fish oil supplements even after I formed them I have an allergy. I will just keep drinking jocko white tea and roll against three people at once, submitting them all simultaneously.
941 2018-03-14 21:52:13 Well, in Brazil (we aren't OPEC) we felt the impact from the oil prices drop quite a bit in our economy. Not as much as the Venezuelans, probably because we have a strong national agriculture sector.
942 2018-03-14 21:52:03 I shop when I'm bored too.
943 2018-03-14 21:51:13 You guys are funny. If you wanna take all money out of politics ok. How is your argument to look at only this specific area of industry influence of our laws? C'mon...logic please.....
Pharma? GMO s? Big oil? Food MFG? 

Don't argue when you cherry pick the circumstances. Not tru

949 2018-03-14 21:50:37 Best scenario was for England to drop out. If we had shallow waters, no gas or oil, no stone, no nuclear and nada water - we would be gone.

952 2018-03-14 21:50:14 The predominance of maltreatment of widows is spreading to other regions because leaders like @benmurraybruce would rather give them rice and palm oil instead of fighting wicked inlaws to take back what has been stolen from widows.

966 2018-03-14 21:48:03 Republicans there were conned by President Trump. Understandable. He has always been a snake oil salesman - nothing else.
967 2018-03-14 21:47:51 protesting an oil pipeline is the equivalent of cosigning future use of oil.  This is a crossroads, time to find an alternative energy source...

1000 2018-03-14 21:43:30 The US does not need any stinking Syrian oil. We have plenty for ourselves from our own sources. Trump does not give a crap about oil and wants to get the hell out of the middle east. Problem is middle east exports terrorism and US cannot get out until that problem is mitigated.

1004 2018-03-14 21:42:32 Happy HUMP day! 
I used the Revelations bath oil. My skin is so v. thankful!
1005 2018-03-14 21:42:30 Whenever people ask me why my skin is so nice I tell them “It’s not, but my angles are.” or “Vitamin E oil” mostly the first one tho
1006 2018-03-14 21:42:08 I wonder if Oil don't already have a new coach lined up...
1007 2018-03-14 21:41:57 They don't want a discussion they want their narrative
1008 2018-03-14 21:41:41 The guy fixing my car told me I needed an oil change and started laughing!!!!!!! I know ok!!!!!!
1009 2018-03-14 21:41:38 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1010 2018-03-14 21:41:38 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1011 2018-03-14 21:41:35 Sessions is the head of the DOJ, WTF is he considering anything recommended by trump? Why trumps ass is in boiling oil as it is, trying to remake our entire justice system into his own corrupt image.

1013 2018-03-14 21:40:46 JB and Chris have pledged but they still have investment in DAPL and Big Oil and both still haven't released there full tax returns so i would a  ? On them two
1014 2018-03-14 21:40:40 This last bit is true, but what you said about Venezuela being broke because of the US energy shift is not.
You should consider Venezuelan debt, mismanagement of the oil industry, expanding deficit funded with uncontrolled money printing and currency exchange and price controls.
1015 2018-03-14 21:40:37 It boils down to: Why invest in transporting yesterday's energy source. Burning oil is clearly not the way of the future. Lets cut out loses. Lets look to the future and invest accordingly.
1016 2018-03-14 21:40:33 And when this is pointed out the response isn't why did government fail but instead is child murderer, gun bumper, ammosexual, nra, etc.

1025 2018-03-14 21:39:34 Trump has never paid a phone bill, cooked a meal, shoveled a driveway, applied for a job, written a resume, washed a load of laundry, changed a car's oil, or made a doctors appointment himself.
1026 2018-03-14 21:39:26 There are 550 million bbls of Tar Sands potential in what was once the Bears Ears Nat,l Monument. The company with the majority of leases, Kirkwood Oil and Gas, has a history of bankruptcy and Trump donations.

1040 2018-03-14 21:37:13 I love the changes to the website...oil bottle pics, etc. So neat and streamlined! And the labels are THE BEST! Thanks so much!
1041 2018-03-14 21:36:56 You have to get on the Trump train or get off of it… I love it, Reagan would have fired Tillerson along time ago. Pompeo is the better guy for the job, and oil company CEO is not the guy to negotiate with North Korea

1050 2018-03-14 21:35:52 Lemon zest, lemon juice, a bit of oil, minced garlic, dried tarragon, salt and pepper. Brush on then barbecue (keeps the stink outside). Serve it with homemade tartar sauce (literally mayo, relish, dill and lemon juice).
1051 2018-03-14 21:35:52 I was a grey belt warrior. The most I learned was how to fall and to yell "check his oil" while people were grappling.
1052 2018-03-14 21:35:46 Really? Why do you think Russia is our enemy?

Syria?

Why did we refuse entry to three young people?

Islamic pressure? Saudi oil money?
1053 2018-03-14 21:35:45 Oh, not around here. We’re about...I’ll guess 6 hours from that place. There’s a hum in the air, though (bitter modern truth: “hum” autocorrected to “gun”). Finally, snake oil shares are falling in PA.
1054 2018-03-14 21:35:33 Interesting idea relying on Rousseau type theory of inherient goodness of man and that criminals would not exploit the absence of firearms.

1061 2018-03-14 21:34:46 Then they need to sue the politicians who subsidize the oil companies who wouldn't have been able to make profit without the people's money, that's stopped finances going to clean energy or some other clean product so long ago that we wouldn't be in this situation now! @elonmusk
1062 2018-03-14 21:34:31 The majority don't have a position and are following along due to peer pressure and the desire to skip class whenever possible, the vocal one that have been shoved onto the news most certainly do.
1063 2018-03-14 21:34:06 No worries. Your oil is amazing stuff.

1068 2018-03-14 21:33:30 Sinful indeed, has tho not heard of LPG, you will repent when oil boilers go the way of diesel cars. 
1069 2018-03-14 21:33:26 It was mid week last week. Was talking about the 15 mm bpd global demand for light oil and what incremental space there actually was for US supply. It was in response to anothe post I think. Support for the case that Lto isn’t that simple.
1070 2018-03-14 21:33:22 Don't you think that net energy produced has a role in the actual economical situation? The cost to drill a new well+fracking is around 100 thousand barrel of oil.

1074 2018-03-14 21:32:25 I was reading up that UKOG don't use fracking techniques and that the oil bearing shales are all naturally fracked.
1075 2018-03-14 21:32:15 S/O to @JoeBudden & @MAL___ for giving women who do the body butter/ baby oil combo props.

1079 2018-03-14 21:32:06 By slowing renewables trump along with the oil industry to also slow the decline in usage of oil & gas !
1080 2018-03-14 21:31:57 Finally getting a damn oil change
1081 2018-03-14 21:31:28 I repeat. THE USA CREATED THE VX NERVE AGENT USED TO KILL KIM JONG UN's BROTHER. The USA didn't have to account for its use. Russia was well on the way to supplying Europe (UK included) with lots of oil and gas. I don't think that will continue.

1088 2018-03-14 21:31:02 I recommend them to every1. ur eyes always pop & u can cry, swim & wash ur whole face. It doesn’t hurt. they fall off naturally & when u only have a few u can put oil so they fall off faster, if u aren’t going to get a Fill. Ur natural lashes only fall off if u pick @ the fake 1s
1089 2018-03-14 21:30:52 As a vegan/vegetarian do you actively try to avoid products with palm oil?
1090 2018-03-14 21:30:39 No matter the season, your oil ALWAYS needs to be in top shape to get you through it.

1094 2018-03-14 21:30:23 @Tracee_Bentley testified in opposition to HB 1157 on incident reporting this afternoon. The oil and natural gas industry takes safety very seriously. With that being said we are not supportive of duplicative or less stringent reporting requirements. #copolitics #coleg
1095 2018-03-14 21:30:21 It was the funeral of one of the lads today,he died just before he was due to fly to India,his son read the Eulogy, he said,"Funnily enough dad believed in reincarnation but knowing his luck he'll come back as an oil drum & be stuck in the garage for 30 years" Got quite a laugh.

1101 2018-03-14 21:30:03 Maybe you need to watch "Mississippi Burning" , "Selma" and "Roots."  Or "The Godfather", "Serpico", "New Jack City"  and "Blow".  Life in the USA hasn't been 1950's cartoon - ever.
1102 2018-03-14 21:29:54 Im not saying that there aren’t those that want ALL guns removed. But thats not what  a majority of students are working towards

1112 2018-03-14 21:28:07 I love listening to out of touch pundits living in first world countries preach the end of the oil age. Are people aware there are places still burning wood and coal? Don't think people understand the luxury of pipelines. The future is growing O&G infrastructure, not replacement.
1113 2018-03-14 21:27:58 Students from Florida, Chicago, Detroit are asking regulations to keep guns away from the mentally incompetent, domestic abuse offenders.
1114 2018-03-14 21:27:52 And that's only because it pays govt officials and their oil cabals more to continue to import fuel. What a shame on this govt.
1115 2018-03-14 21:27:50 Ooh good can I pick them , tubby from Glasto , Saint DJ dog walker  from St Reatham & the Tottenham snake oil salesman .
1116 2018-03-14 21:27:34 I wonder which teams Chelsea fans supported before the oil money came in
1117 2018-03-14 21:27:09 Years ago 1GBP was worth around US$5.  Sometime, I think in the 1970's, the two currencies were about on par, 1:1 but I didn't know the reason for that.  Now I have a better idea, it's about size & power to do with oil & trade.  The US now has huge oil supplies.
1118 2018-03-14 21:27:08 Venezuela is broken mostly because USA got enough gas from frakking to go from main importer to major exporter of oil. Coal gas has upturned the energy economy, and since the prices dropped, and they lost their main client, their imports & exports are way off their usual balance.
1119 2018-03-14 21:27:03 Check out cannabis oil for MS .... seriously ....
1120 2018-03-14 21:26:55 America’s Russian revenge will be keeping oil prices low to continue to lower GDP in Russia.
1121 2018-03-14 21:26:26 I would give anything to rewind 2 years, decline chemo and radio and take cannabis oil. It infuriates me that people are put through painful, damaging medicine with life long side effects when there is a natural solution!
1122 2018-03-14 21:26:17 Funny how Assad was not a problem to western Govts, until he choose the wrong oil/gas pipeline, then he became public enemy number one.
1123 2018-03-14 21:26:16 We're also not seeing people from stable, prosperous countries flocking here (like Norway).  Mostly when there is war, famine, political upheaval, or religious persecution -do people "flock" here.

1126 2018-03-14 21:25:45 I just started loc’n so because my locs are so young, I don’t swim as often. However when I do, if I recently washed my hair, I do a cowash (about 1-2 washes). Make sure you oil them locs/roots after too!
1127 2018-03-14 21:25:45 But you have money to search for oil in Lake Chad. Bros use d foreign reserve
1128 2018-03-14 21:25:43 I've been wondering lately, most if not all tires aren't built to last long, and most if not all are made with oil. Have you ever thought a solution for tires made of different or revolutionary material to last far longer as well as without oil? @elonmusk #green #tech

1132 2018-03-14 21:25:22 Whataboutism justifies a death spiral into incivility by all? Weak argument actions of one give license to another acting in similar manner
1133 2018-03-14 21:25:13 its also nice because soaps and cleansers have some oil in it, and leave a bit of film on your face, the toner washes that off
1134 2018-03-14 21:25:01 You can use a few drops of each oil but I recommend castor oil plus another additional oil that I listed. You can also get beard oil products.
1135 2018-03-14 21:24:41 Why not tour some oil producing cities and facilities and show that industry some support it’s bigger than the steel industry. Oh my bad those are mostly in Alberta and Saskatchewan. @jkenney @RachelNotley

1140 2018-03-14 21:23:59 One of the Nigerian governemnts biggest problems is that they overstate their role in the economy. I still cannot fathom why the state oil company insists on being the sole importer of petroleum
1141 2018-03-14 21:23:58 @OfficeGovEthics We need this criminals out. @JudiciaryDems you need us to pay for a soundproof booth so you can take oil kickbacks.

1144 2018-03-14 21:23:45 "Past Presidents"???  George W. Bush, Republican, who dragged the U.S. into an illegal, unjustified invasion of a sovereign nation because "it sits on a sea of oil" - in total contempt of worldwide protests. 
1145 2018-03-14 21:23:34 I'd rather see #MeanMarkCallous step to the ring..kick Cena in the nads..beat him until he is an oil stain..and then,when the bell rings,the gong sounds,the lights go out,&as they slowly rise #TheUndertaker is in the ring,picks Cena up,tombstones him...pin....1-2-3...just sayin'
1146 2018-03-14 21:23:31 Entire group of you are hypocrites. You import dirty oil and want to be green? Go buy a horse. Stop flying and dress in hemp. No petroleum by products.
1147 2018-03-14 21:23:26 So Reddit has a cool series on oil and gas.

1149 2018-03-14 21:22:45 There's a chicken tikka one I think too  and extra olive oil. In fact I'll have to post what I've got haha
1150 2018-03-14 21:22:37 We should never forget that very smart people sincerely believed that nuclear power's inherent advantages and unstoppable process would end oil drilling as unprofitable by 2000.
1151 2018-03-14 21:22:36 anyway i just got a commission to draw TURKISH OIL WRESTLING and that's gonna be a hoot and a half

1155 2018-03-14 21:21:42 Oh my!!! They even included the coconut oil!!!! So so guilty!!! 
1156 2018-03-14 21:21:41 It was superb and yes dairy free too, hence the rapeseed oil to accompany the bread. Fantastic location with lots of people watching opportunities.

1163 2018-03-14 21:20:19 I missed or forgot that one, What I do remember of Tillerson critic is that he was an oilman. That means 1) He is not a professional diplomat or politician, and 2) the oil industry is evil.
1164 2018-03-14 21:20:08 Yes he's cleaning their windshield, bet he's gonna check the tires and oil too , #LostArt
1165 2018-03-14 21:19:56 Some people also use coconut oil as a hair mask for their pets and it works.
1166 2018-03-14 21:19:53 Just tried a weird facial oil...it was like I was putting olive oil on my face...
1167 2018-03-14 21:19:47 - I’m so glad they can do my oil change today . They were so SLAMMED yesterday.
1168 2018-03-14 21:19:39 Walmart just kept me here for 1hr & 30 min when i only was supposed to be here 30 min for an oil change 
1169 2018-03-14 21:19:35 Media bears responsibility here spinning pedestrian businesses or snake oil vaporware into gold in the need for news and analysis. Poke more
1170 2018-03-14 21:19:27 Dawn usually dries out skin and sometimes during spring and summer all of dogs get allergies from just being outside. So its best to use shampoo with coconut oil or aloe Vera plus also using a conditioner to lock in moisture just like how we use both
1171 2018-03-14 21:19:25 The coalition. No one is actually using the oil wells in occupied territory (aside from Golan Heights) and that is the problem, Syria could be using it to provide some funding for the state. Iran has been invited to assist, just as in Iraq.

1182 2018-03-14 21:16:51 Years back, some news reports stated that canola oil was very healthy.  I began using it a lot; and now, I might be learning otherwise.  Not good.  #health
1183 2018-03-14 21:16:51 The way my car drives after an oil change

1188 2018-03-14 21:16:07 You can  Google  but with my children  ,i used warm sweet oil.  Sometimes  those  home remedies  are  far better  than  doctor prescribed...  i would  drop  one  drop in affected  ear.... but  Google  essential  oils for children with ear infection.
1189 2018-03-14 21:16:00 I’m just trying to get my oil change 
1190 2018-03-14 21:16:00 I wish I knew shit about cars. I love seeing ladies working at Jiffy Lube and changing my oil like a badass. You better work, Queen 
1191 2018-03-14 21:15:50 And he did score.
1192 2018-03-14 21:15:29 Not only that, canola oil smells & tastes f***king horrible. Any food needing to be deodorized can't possibly be good for you
1193 2018-03-14 21:15:27 Trying to score goals. Which is more likely he does than JP.  But I know we are oceans apart on this.
1194 2018-03-14 21:15:19 Try using hydrating products. I'm super oily. I read that oily skin might mean that your skin is dehydrated causing to produce more oil. Ever since I changed products I've noticed the oil reduced a lot. I'm still oily but looks more like I'm dewy. Hope this helps!
1195 2018-03-14 21:15:13 I didn't see end to Obamacare Mandate, N.K. deal, 11 Million barrels of oil production daily, 66-to-1 regulation cuts & 60% reduction in illegal immigration. Also ISIS chased out of land they once held.  The media is so distracted they can't (or won't) report any of it.
1196 2018-03-14 21:15:13 I got my oil changed today at MalWart & they got my car mixed up with someone else's in their computer. When I went to claim my car after an hour and a half, I had seen them drive it out the door so I knew it was done, but their computer said it was still waiting.
1197 2018-03-14 21:15:06 That’s why coconut oil has *some usefulness. It’s a cleanser so it’s nice to have it in your hair before swimming so when you rinse, the oil cleanses the scalp gently
1198 2018-03-14 21:15:04 Need to get a move on then and get the oil and gas from under Gatwick!
1199 2018-03-14 21:14:59 During Senate hearing, @SecretaryZinke presented this #falsechoice. When asked about proposal to raise park fees to $70/vehicle - he blamed vets, elderly, 4th graders & disabled, BUT forgot to mention his 6-figure door renovation & giveaways to big oil & gas. #outdoorsforall
1200 2018-03-14 21:14:52 Sooo, THAT’S where the baby oil went.
1201 2018-03-14 21:14:34 First Shea moisture jcbo leave in, then cantu coconut curling cream then oil to seal

But today it was regular price cause they werent advertising the special... and i only paid $27

I was set up for greatness.
1209 2018-03-14 21:13:17 What we oppose is a duplicative bill. The oil & gas industry is already reporting incidents to the requirements within the bill and often times our reporting extends beyond what is listed in this bill.

1212 2018-03-14 21:12:56 Spent the day with MN soybean growers talking #biodiesel on The Hill. Why do I support biodiesel? Homegrown, renewable, less dependence on foreign oil, better for the environment and creates jobs. What other fuel does that? #MNfarmers4Biodiesel
1213 2018-03-14 21:12:44 I put tea tree oil in my bath n it smells divine

1215 2018-03-14 21:12:13 It is like adding oil on flames.

1218 2018-03-14 21:12:00 Pipelines to export oil & natural gas to Canadian tidewater are part of the solution to this dependency. But so far Canadians would rather continue shooting themselves in the foot.

1223 2018-03-14 21:11:04 U.K. imports very little oil from Russia.

1229 2018-03-14 21:10:22 Hi, this oil is mineral, semi synthetic o synthetic? I'm about to buy it at Sam's Club (part 550024058) but i need to know for sure the type of oil, thank you
1230 2018-03-14 21:10:14 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this March? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
1231 2018-03-14 21:10:09 ...brought things forward significantly! Changes like this never happen quickly enough - governments as they oppose each other see a few years ahead, never to a meaningful, long-term future; oil companies only see the future in terms of extracting crude and financial profit!

1233 2018-03-14 21:10:05 I think it should also have an hourly update on the price of oil, Marine Atlantic cancellations, and the price of tea in China.
1234 2018-03-14 21:09:53 Spot on
1235 2018-03-14 21:09:51 I had to look up the ingredients.. orange, lavender and lemon oil. I know oranges are good for success and prosperity and lavender is normally used for love, protection and purification. Lemons... I have no idea.
1236 2018-03-14 21:09:48 Remember when Chelsea didn’t have oil money.
1237 2018-03-14 21:09:38 We buy oil from these troglodites

1243 2018-03-14 21:08:57 Sonic 2 has many amazing zones, so I'm disappointed we didn't get stuff like Emerald Hill, Mystic Cave or even Hill Top in Mania.

Chemical Plant is a good stage, but over done at this point, and Oil Ocean, while an interesting choice, is the one stage that makes me wanna stop.

I like to begin that section by writing a random 2-digit number on the whiteboard and saying that you have to be careful of statistics because that's the percentage of statistics that are made up on the spot. Then I ask how many students wrote that down.

1255 2018-03-14 21:07:42 impressed a college prof when he asked for one of the exports from Sicily and I answered olive oil.  When asked how I knew that, my response was that my hubby made me watch all of the Godfather movies! lol

1297 2018-03-14 21:01:08 Stop using any and all petroleum and gas products...try it even for a single day. And as you sit there naked in the cold dark perhaps then, and only then, you can pretend you're not a hypocrite brainwashed by foreign oil money propaganda.

1309 2018-03-14 21:00:11 Why? UK is the 6th largest economy in the world. Is a major user of gas and oil as well as one of the the world's financial centres. Is a permanent member of the UN Security council. A core member of NATO. A close ally of the USA and a Nuclear power. Not laughable.

1314 2018-03-14 20:59:50 Once I got an oil-diffuser I end up pouring any leftover water into them with some lemon oil and then my room smells nice.
1315 2018-03-14 20:59:49 I love coming to get my oil changed. It smells like my childhood
1316 2018-03-14 20:59:39 Definitely! I bought CBD oil a few months ago & never took it because my anxiety kept whispering “you don’t know how it’ll make you feel. What if it makes you worse? You better just not use it.” Recently started it and it’s helped so much. I’m trying to call it on it’s bs.
1317 2018-03-14 20:59:35 The oil burner is the shit
1318 2018-03-14 20:59:35 Yeah? I was thinking I’d ride in Saturday and change the oil and lube the chain up

1320 2018-03-14 20:59:19 I just used beard oil for the first time and I’m very impressed. I’ve definitely been missing out since I first got my beard 25 years ago.
1321 2018-03-14 20:59:17 I'm sceptical about that chicken claim so please do tell me how it goes.

The air fryer is great for foods that already contain fat. Oven chips, semi-prep stuff, etc. Cooking chips in it takes some getting used to as you need to toss them in oil.

1325 2018-03-14 20:58:26 Is it about the gas this time, rather than oil?

1333 2018-03-14 20:57:25 Igualmente "el campo" putea y bastante a MM "Nos prometió que nos iba a ayudar y nos mata con los aumentos en los costos y gas oil"
1334 2018-03-14 20:57:22 best approach would be go after their dark money that goes through London, push US to frack more to lower global oil costs, disrupt their energy sector. those will really hurt them but how do you calibrate it ?

1340 2018-03-14 20:56:47 Russia is what North Korea wants to be. A big nuclear power but economic dwarfs. Sadly for North Korea it doesn’t have oil. They only way to win the new Cold War is the way we won the old  ie. run their economies to the ground : New arm’s race and sanctions. Sad...

1342 2018-03-14 20:56:29 My dad wouldn’t let me learn how to drive until I knew how to change the oil, top off fluids, check tire pressure, and change the tire in a flat. A vehicle is a huge responsibility and this is basic information everyone should know (along with how to drive manual IMO)

1348 2018-03-14 20:56:06 Dude you fav is just rice soaked in oil. Fast lane to heart diseases.
1349 2018-03-14 20:55:58 Also... YOU ARE BLIND! Tails was glitching out on Oil Ocean for a straight 14 seconds! How did you not notice?!
1350 2018-03-14 20:55:53 Guy who just called says oil prices will be at $25-30 next year. I'd consider that bad news, except I recognized his voice and it's clearly the same prognosticator who told me 3 years ago at the @newsminer that WWIII was going to start in 2016 between China/NK, with nukes.
1351 2018-03-14 20:55:33 Smoking the blossoms of the herb can be enjoyable but it doesn't provide much pain relief for me personally. However, when I vape a good oil extract the higher THC levels more than kills the pain. Puts me in a far better mood as well.

1355 2018-03-14 20:55:05 No matter the season, your oil ALWAYS needs to be in top shape to get you through it.

1362 2018-03-14 20:54:05 I spilled castor oil all over my birthday outfit
1363 2018-03-14 20:53:57 You refuse to acknowledge basic facts, exactly what I expected.  No surprise there - facts and conservatives go together like oil and water.
1364 2018-03-14 20:53:30 All so you can drill.  Just exactly how much did you get from your oil donors in exchange for your vote on the #GOPTaxScam ?   Why don’t you ever answer that question?  Maybe because you’re a SELL OUT?

1368 2018-03-14 20:52:48 Think about how much $ Canada would have if we got our oil to tidewater east and west. $ for health, education, military procurement, First Nations, the Arctic. It boggles the mind.
1369 2018-03-14 20:52:48 If you can't reverse park, change a tyre, fuel up, check your own oil or drive a manual, you should be banished to public transport until you can.

1376 2018-03-14 20:52:00 #SkinFit2018 Day 14. Make sure you cleanse your skin well after you hit the gym. As we sweat our pores enlarge, making our skin more susceptible to dirt and oil build-up. Our travel size products are great to keep in your gym bag!

1398 2018-03-14 20:49:44 BRAVO! The DEM cheating, collusion, lies & snake oil is paying off. Couldnt work without the sheep.
1399 2018-03-14 20:49:43 Coconut oil is really wonderful right? I used to use it on my stretched ear lobes too which ended up being not that soft cause I kind of messed up during the stretching process but it's alright

1409 2018-03-14 20:48:36 Is this some kind of twisted joke? You complain about no climate change action in the same sentence you complain that there was no oil pipeline built? Literally... the same sentence? Unbelievable.
1410 2018-03-14 20:48:30 Sometimes, your instinct on how to heal "better" is correct. And I now have a real example of a time when I could have whimpered and given up my vow to improve my health.

As for Takata air bags, why aren't the car manufactures in as much hot water?

1427 2018-03-14 20:45:06 We need a wide midfielder/forward. Seems tough to harness a DM, AR, oil, mkhi, wide mid and Auba into a front 6 and still defend well. It shouldn't be...But it would be.

They may not have everything Photoshop has, but they're geared towards making digital art.

Alternatively, there's Corel, but that's designed to mimic physical media like watercolors and oil paints.

No one wants to fight for oil, or being dumped on British streets to be #homeless - or even lied to by ministers to them have to serve up their racist hate!

1639 2018-03-14 20:14:38 It's great that you try to pre-empt the "what about nationalized oil wealth?" criticism...but why not actually do it?  What percentage of the non-home/non-oil wealth is owned by the state?  You could accomplish this in all of two sentences, to de-exoticify Norway.

Lavender essential oil has also been shown to be quite effective for treating hair loss, particularly for those who suffer from alopecia, an autoimmune disease where the body rejects its own hair follicles.
1641 2018-03-14 20:14:27 It doesn't react to news (financial) in the correct way. A YouTuber shouting the word moon will do alot more damage than some government, what fucking sense does that make? Imagine DougPolk could move the price of oil or Netflix stock, it's a joke.
1642 2018-03-14 20:14:17 Yes but even if you could afford lots of candles, oil or gas, it still wouldn't have been as bright as you see in most shows.
1643 2018-03-14 20:14:09 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1644 2018-03-14 20:13:52 Mike would rather Canadians pay a carbon tax drive up energy prices and hinder Canadian economy but support the input of dirty oil. Without environmental checklists.

1647 2018-03-14 20:13:34 That's why Trump is bringing back steel companies to America. Someday soon we won't need oil anymore

1653 2018-03-14 20:12:50 I didn't ask you to "supply facts". Our family has been involved in the oil patch/sands for 30+years, I'm well aware of what has/hasn't been done by gov't.  And again, Trudeau is doing nothing to ease tensions with BC/AB and you arguing other issues doesn't change that "fact".

1677 2018-03-14 20:09:49 I'm not sure about that. Israel wants to turn Syria & Lebanon into a Greater Israel but Russia is standing on their way to do that. There is a lot of oil in Syria which they want to exploit but Russia is on their way. Russia is surrounded by Nato on the western front.

1706 2018-03-14 20:04:30 Let's have it right the UK is a joke of a nation Russia would ruin us. Also the BBC & Government hypocrisy is beyond word's. We invaded Iraq & killed millons on lies for oil. Fact. As of yet I've seen no facts Russia has done any wrong. Also I would rather have Putin over May.
1707 2018-03-14 20:04:25 I'm looking for a used show halter nothing super expensive dark oil with a chain lead.

1713 2018-03-14 20:03:16 *wakes up after a night of heavy drinking*
Ugh, I feel awful. Must be the fish oil supplements I took 3 days ago.

*pouring mimosa*
 I should really throw those out.
1714 2018-03-14 20:02:57 True, but also now the world' biggest oil exporter.  Doing deals with the far East to try and establish the petro-renminbi.  And rules with an iron fist, untrammeled by our sorts of checks and balances.

1716 2018-03-14 20:02:36 Be that as it may... they deserve the evidence.. and youre telling me MI5 isnt doing exavtly the same elsewhere? Its just a bodged job theyre hyperbolising to start a scrap with Russia over oil in the Middle East and/or distract from Brexit

1731 2018-03-14 20:01:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
1732 2018-03-14 20:01:06 Stupid restaurant pro-tip. Put a liberal dosing of salt and then ice into the cup. Cover it and swirl it around for a while. It cuts the coffee oil quickly and can pull up the grime.

We used to do that when someone left a pot on the warmer until there was burnt residue.
1733 2018-03-14 20:01:00 ONE of the seven sisters>>>they have caused conflict, war, oppression and resource stealing!! formerly Standard Oil>>>research it!
1734 2018-03-14 20:00:45 @Nidhi , This is a very serious issue for India. US challenges India's export subsidy programme at WTO .It may adversely impact our country and BJP may be counting on low oil prices. Its worth having debate by calling experts !! . Thanks for taking note

1740 2018-03-14 19:59:56 We have plenty of honest reviews floating around the Internet, try Google for Crotch Guard Skin Care Oil reviews

1742 2018-03-14 19:59:51 The only way to stop Twitter & FB from censorship is for the govt to break them up with antitrust laws. Both are a monopoly. They did it with Bell and Standard Oil.

1746 2018-03-14 19:59:13 that looks like *puts sunglasses on* snake oil
1747 2018-03-14 19:59:12 Then you should focus more on the massive amounts of US oil being pumped out of the ground. Far greater GHG emissions from all of that activity. Did you know Canada only emits 1.6% of global emissions? It seems odd that you'd target us
1748 2018-03-14 19:59:12 Tree oil is good, the pixi glow tonic toner is good because it has glycolic acid. You could also go to a spa and get a acne facial with extractions
1749 2018-03-14 19:59:10 I just got some chicken nuggets with it.  It’s ok.  Really just tastes like a little Szechuan peppers and sesame oil.  Seems easy to make and improve on.

Personally I was sorry to see Jedediah leave as I found her to be very intelligent and interesting to listen to even tho she and Whoopi seemed to be oil and water. But MM is downright useless on this show

1764 2018-03-14 19:56:51 We are on the bumpy plateau of peak oil. It could easily take 20 years or more. I think it started in 2005.
1765 2018-03-14 19:56:39 انا ذاكرت water مش مهم ال oil
1766 2018-03-14 19:56:33 - motion to my own head, inclining my head knowingly.* I often describe it as cotton wool being shoved in there. Makes everything all fuzzy and slows you down. Like a car that needs a fresh oil change.

He is a con, a snake oil salesman.

1772 2018-03-14 19:55:39 I feel you skin wise. Upside: Coconut oil (which I have copious amounts of shout) has been very very good to me on my body. Downside: Not on my face. Got my first cheek pimple. AND I'm too old for this shyte.
1773 2018-03-14 19:55:30 thank goodness it's not motor oil...

1775 2018-03-14 19:54:08 More drilling and more American oil means cheaper costs and a higher standard of living for all Americans.
1776 2018-03-14 19:54:04 Absolutely. And we'll still need more rice and actual silica gel and olive oil.

1778 2018-03-14 19:54:00 I have an idea for you, #Trump - take the money you want to waste on a parade and use that to build up our infrastructure. Then you can add money you want to give to oligarchs and use that for schools. Use money you want to give to oil & gas companies for veterans, kids & seniors
1779 2018-03-14 19:53:50 US challenges India's export subsidy programme at WTO :  Jaitely, no cheap politics on how to aviod special status for AP.Focus on Export subsiday ! may adversely hit our country (don't count on oil low prices).

1802 2018-03-14 19:51:00 Adding scents to lubricating oils is an actual thing now.  It lets manufacturers make sure the oil is only changed out for their own product. One old guy told me it was a fad for a while back in the 60s as well.
1803 2018-03-14 19:50:54 Think I freaked my heating oil guy out when he put the hose in our outside filler pipe and I moaned “MMM YEAH” from the other side of the wall.

1830 2018-03-14 19:47:18 Here’s the thing, I don’t believe he hates oil, his lifestyle is proof of that. But he does love power. He’s playing politics in order to retain it.
1831 2018-03-14 19:47:08 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.

Stay woke
1836 2018-03-14 19:46:15 But, what if we add a wind turbine to the top of oil rig?  Should be liberal compliant then.
1837 2018-03-14 19:46:09 Work to improve their country? You know America is the ONLY 1st world country that hasn’t improved, correct? Our emissions, payments, oil problem, medical problem, stand on cannabis, etc. hasn’t improved.
1838 2018-03-14 19:46:05 You realize that Kenney's job killing cuts and austerity would halt our economic recovery from the oil price collapse? And his repeal of our CLP and Ctax would kill ANY chance of a pipeline?

1842 2018-03-14 19:44:45 Lmao the whole TL knows Des and baby oil are besties
1843 2018-03-14 19:44:31 Not necessarily the supplies that are running low, more the investment into the North Sea. More money to be had for large oil companies elsewhere at the current oil price.

1846 2018-03-14 19:44:23 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
1847 2018-03-14 19:44:18 Would you really send that fat oaf that masquerades as a Foreign Sec? He can't be trusted to go to the shop for a pint of milk without making a balls of it/complete tit of himself. Putin's shitting bricks.He has oil &gas on his side,what do we have?
1848 2018-03-14 19:44:13 Girl try Palmer's Cocoa Butter Skin Therapy Oil. I don't get much sleep so I had Gucci suitcases under my eyes until I started using this
1849 2018-03-14 19:44:03 The problem is that the US Petrol companies are equally foreign---this is dueling foreign interests that want to take advantage of Canada.  And I am not some brainwashed TIDES dupe, oil will spill, it's bad for environment, aboriginal rights must be protected.

1854 2018-03-14 19:43:17 To záleží na tom, jak se mi líbila Olive Oil. Taky to nemusí být ani jedno, pouze sdělení bez citového zabarvení. Speciálně muži to občas dělají aniž by věděli do jaké bryndy se řítí.
1855 2018-03-14 19:43:09 God bless argan oil 
1856 2018-03-14 19:43:06 The idea Bernie can sell out to the dairy industry and the NRA kind of proves my point. If Bernie represented Texas he'd be a shill for the Oil industry in NY he'd be praising Wall Street. His "purity" is based on Vermont doing nothing but producing milk and exporting guns
1857 2018-03-14 19:42:51 What will the price of oil be after this line is built?
1858 2018-03-14 19:42:45 What I'm hearing through their mediaries is the big 4 oil majors is considering supporting a full on $40/ton cost on Congress, @SenWhitehouse says. If they are willing to do that, that's only $10 bucks off my bill. "They have to be serious on it," he adds.
1859 2018-03-14 19:42:41 If Trump fires Attorney General Sessions and replaces him with Pruitt, I'm looking forward to Senate Judiciary Committee hearings where @SenWhitehouse can ask Pruitt about climate change and his ties to big oil companies & the Kochs
1860 2018-03-14 19:42:35 When I was Casino boss in 80's we had a lot of Gulf oil money players. One thing that was evident was the mercurial explosive tempers they had/have.One of my guys had traveled extensively in Mid East. He related the common practice of cousin marriage there. Violence is a symptom
1861 2018-03-14 19:42:33 The light of the body is the eye. Make sure your lamp is filled with oil.
1862 2018-03-14 19:42:17 Natural organic  hair oil tamed my natural curly wild Irish hair .. wow
1863 2018-03-14 19:42:10 You do realize that Trump has authorized the sale of deadly weapons to Ukraine, don't you? Bombed Syria, Russia's proxy? Opened up USA Oil drilling, Russia's worst nightmare.  Still you believe the propaganda
1864 2018-03-14 19:41:55 I'm going to go out on a limb here, but I reckon our foreign policy (good and bad) is slightly more complicated than "because oil"
1865 2018-03-14 19:41:47 #IEA seems likely to bump 2018 oil demand forecast tomorrow.
1866 2018-03-14 19:41:30 I rather smell cow crap than gear oil ha
1867 2018-03-14 19:41:27 yes! for work i’m able to text &leave due to sensory overload or anxiety/meltdown related issues. i also have an exception to our ‘scent free’ rule in order to use an essential oil diffuser @my desk &signs in the kitchen not to reheat stinky food (i’m right across the hall)
1868 2018-03-14 19:41:06 Give me narrowly focused and exceptional, please.
1869 2018-03-14 19:41:03 So it's all about oil/gas....

1872 2018-03-14 19:40:39 How will you pay for it? From oil and farm subsidies, Ihope, the only logical source.
1873 2018-03-14 19:40:36 U.S. crude oil may also be in the mix , China taking @ 200k bbls/day from the U.S. , 20% of our oil exports or @ $5 BN annually

1875 2018-03-14 19:40:35 Urn-Old Shoe-Farts- Nigger is pimping for global warming hoax & suing the oil companies. The MF white monkey is right. He doesn't need gasoline. He fills up his jet  & his coffee mug  with fresh urine every morning.

1877 2018-03-14 19:40:31 Just intake lots of coconut milk/water use coconut oil based products. Like the Organic Coconut oil from Trader Joe’s worked well for myself. Apply to your face in the beard shape form and leave on for 10-15 minutes. Wash and repeat the next day.
1878 2018-03-14 19:40:30 Damn it! Was hoping it would prove to be nonsense. (This is also how I feel about that Vintner's Daughter oil everyone loves.)

1882 2018-03-14 19:40:11 Family Nutrition: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this March? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
1883 2018-03-14 19:40:05 Immature politicians of #UAE who are spoiled by oil and money are learning on the job of foreign policy. Very soon they will realise they have to go to school to study politics with unbearable costs. #فرماجو_يُوحد_الصومال
1884 2018-03-14 19:40:02 I'm sorry Rob, but you were meant to only lead 69....nice
1885 2018-03-14 19:39:51 An odd sensation. But sesame oil makes it tasty!!
1886 2018-03-14 19:39:50 And sorry? LMBO going all round Arabia looting and blowing people up , while stealing their oil, giving scum like Atos-G4S billions and UC which cost more now than if gave most a 100,000G? IS? Osborne caused 132 billion pounds in debt? SO for someone growing own pot it sure does.
1887 2018-03-14 19:39:38 They ruined my girls car oil pan and bolt. Had to fix it. Never having them do anything 
1888 2018-03-14 19:39:24 Most of the people who watch those channels during the day don’t have jobs anyway.
1889 2018-03-14 19:39:20 Very troubled by #LarryKudlow support of Iraq War to grab oil because that's not who we are as a nation and death, chaos, terror followed.
1890 2018-03-14 19:39:15 Does anyone know exactly why there is no money in Central Bank of SSudan despite the ‘’booming economy’’ and the rising oil price? Hell, one can’t even withdraw from their commercial bank accounts ‘coz BOSS seized incoming transfers. And president says ‘there is nothing we can?’
1891 2018-03-14 19:39:08 I mean, overwhelmingly the general tranquillity, it must be protected would be useless to explore what the Western oil companies were supplying oil directly to the United States will be thy guide, And lead thee hence through the intervention of the New York Packet.
1892 2018-03-14 19:39:04 I’d use that Nutella Gearbox Oil
1893 2018-03-14 19:39:02 May as well get it fixed properly. Makes sense he has played with it injured a long time because he has played like crap for most of the time with Oil. Only has had one good year.
1894 2018-03-14 19:38:58 He never mentions Turkey v Syrian & Turkish Kurds? Very niche. He never lived there, but hey. Who paid for his trip to the Kurdistan referendum last September? Why were his earnings from failing oil co operating in Kurdistan so high? Unexplained wealth
1895 2018-03-14 19:38:55 Good grief. America has been grifted by snake oil salesmen and we don’t want anymore of what the GOP is selling.(aka bad candidates) Try a new product, GOP. Try ethics. Try holding your members accountable to the morals they proclaimed to follow. Try listening.
1896 2018-03-14 19:38:52 Kid shows interest in art, goes to art club during lunch, has stuck it out since September, asks for oil pastels. Buy her oil pastels with the rule that they stay in the proper case (take care of them). The boy sees HER  pastels & has a fit over them & stomps upstairs. FML.
1897 2018-03-14 19:38:46 Check Id of anti pipelines.   Many say Victoria bc but heir comments are only on Canadian oil and Trump.  Canadian?    I wonder! More likely American or other country trolls.   Keeping our economy down.   I've called out a few of them and no reply.
1898 2018-03-14 19:38:39 Hairfinity botanical oil! I literally used it 3 times and there’s growth
1899 2018-03-14 19:38:38 Oil change, tires rotated, and a full tank of gas. Best feeling
1900 2018-03-14 19:38:23 They are brushed with a soybean oil, not butter.
1901 2018-03-14 19:38:21 Mom: “Have you tried the cannabis oil?”
Me: “Ummmm noo........ why do you want to?”
Mom: *discretely nods head and walks away*
1902 2018-03-14 19:38:04 While you are there tell those pipeline protesters to back down and allow the Trans Mountain to be built!. Start doing your job, Canada is losing millions in revenue everyday this oil doesn't flow.

Prove to us you're worth your job as a MP or resign!

1912 2018-03-14 19:36:36 They are the perfect vessel for potatoes, onions, and cheese. It's very important that you boil first, and then fry with onion and BUTTER. Don't even tell me that oil is better. Also, yes, but I prefer to use my hands.
1913 2018-03-14 19:36:26 This new Jonathan McReynolds is taking me completely in. This boy saturated every song with the oil. Just marinated all of ‘em. God bless you sir @jonmcreynolds

1917 2018-03-14 19:35:23 The recycling people have it hard enough as it is, can't somebody oil their squeaky trucks?
1918 2018-03-14 19:35:19 Also the EPA: you can't burn wood in Alaska in the winter, you must spend $4,000 a year for fuel oil.
1919 2018-03-14 19:35:13 @chemsafetyboard  Patridge Raleigh oil site investigation notes that: “Flashing” tanks containing hydrocarbons with a lit oxy-acetylene torch to determine the presence of flammable vapor is unsafe and extremely dangerous.
1920 2018-03-14 19:35:10 $JROOF .95... The Wardroom achieved a peak 24-hour rate of 957 oil-equivalent barrels (“BOE”) per day (68% oil) at 211 Boepd per 1,000 ft.  The projected 30-day normalized rate (IP30) for this 4,518 ft perforated lateral well is 770 BOE per day (67% oil).
1921 2018-03-14 19:35:08 It begs the question on why is it that there are so many concessions for foreign oil and people, at the cost of Canadians, with Justin Trudeau’s Liberals, especially if they are Islamic in origin, as in this case?

1924 2018-03-14 19:35:00 Press extra-firm tofu (I buy nasoya), cut into 1-inch cubes, toss with 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp turmeric, and a spoonful of honey (the resulting flavor is v subtle), and then slowly toss with abt 1 T cornstarch! Cook on baking sheet with v thin layer of oil at 425, flip after 15 min :)
1925 2018-03-14 19:34:46 I'd the castor oil ok going into the water too? Sorry I'm not hot on chemicals.
1926 2018-03-14 19:34:42 2/ The Chrétien Liberals gave the oil sands Accelerated Capital Cost Allowances (tax-breaks) worth $300m/year in 1996 when the price of oil was too low for the oil sands to grow on and those were phased out by the Harper Conservatives between 2010-4.
1927 2018-03-14 19:34:26 Several unsafe work practices contributed to the fatalities and injuries at the Partridge Raleigh oil site - including 
• A gas detector was not used to test for flammable vapor.
1928 2018-03-14 19:34:25 Hes decimating animal rights and giving EPA jobs to Oil/Coal lobbyists to decimate regulations & laws that will hurt our environment just so they can get natural resources the rest of the world is moving away from.. People want FREE solar energy. Im sick of paying electric bills.
1929 2018-03-14 19:34:24 Cool let’s drain out Cushing and diesel stocks along with it and shut a few refiners down for a few weeks to bring home the message.  Can’t wait.
This whole tight oil push is not driven by fundamentals on demand and market need, completely dumb.
1930 2018-03-14 19:34:04 "If we invade Iraq Americans will see $20 a barrel oil prices!" Kudlow couldn't get the time right in the middle of a clock factory.
1931 2018-03-14 19:34:02 You need better friends, olive oil and a weekend away with Beelzebub.
1932 2018-03-14 19:34:00 Thanks, your bio has a typo, or are you really an oil painer?

1935 2018-03-14 19:33:50 I use shampoo on my brushes and sponges and I wash my sponge after every use because I use a loose powder with it and it goes hard if I don't wash it, I've seen some YT videos where people use olive oil + dish soap and kind of leave their sponge soaking in it then wash it out

1946 2018-03-14 19:32:39 @EPAScottPruitt must think the EPA is a covert top secret agency that requires a bug proof phone booth...for what? when he calls the oil & energy lobbyists he works for,  while he uses tax dollars under the guise of EPA business on trips and meetings
1947 2018-03-14 19:32:35 No. Don't put oil in the water. Your sauce won't stick to it as well.
1948 2018-03-14 19:32:33 It’s about time our premier stops sounding like a PR person for oil and gas industry. You also represent Albertans who don’t support the new pipeline
1949 2018-03-14 19:32:28 Oil and gas pipelines don't get enough credit for being 'snuggly.'
1950 2018-03-14 19:32:28 I have a few ideas.. ban democRATS from gun ownership. If you are against oil production, you pay a buck more a gallon for gas. And if you are for higher taxes, raise them on yourself or voluntarily pay more.
1951 2018-03-14 19:32:13 Schwarzenegger ... “terminate” oil . ...  with lawsuits ... for causing climate change.    Curious how he will "prove" CO2 causes climate change. No rigorous science done yet. Existing science "sketchy". Watching with interest. Expect it to peter out.
1952 2018-03-14 19:31:50 Population is not a good indicator, as per capita data is definitely misleading with regards to China because of the high numbers. The source of the outputs (e.g. oil production in US and industrial processing in China) is what gives a better perspective.

1967 2018-03-14 19:30:26 The best time to change your vehicle's oil will be mostly dependent on your manual. Most manuals will have different information, depending on your driving routine and conditions. Cars used in off-roading, racing, or towing will typically need more frequent changes.

(Fresh herbs if possible but dried is fine)
1973 2018-03-14 19:29:46 BC's core opponents cannot be sold to. They are intransigent. IMHO, the oil and pipeline industry couldn't have done a better job of growing the current crop of opponents had it made a point of doing it. And it's not just in Canada.

1975 2018-03-14 19:29:27 The State Dept ran by Rex "Big Oil" Tellerson replaced by the CIA. 
I don't know which is better.
1976 2018-03-14 19:29:21 Well - Im sure Russia will ditch Assad as soon as the war is over & install a puppet. They already extracted his signed agreement to give them Syrias oil & rebuilding contracts, before they joined in to prop him up, so they dont need him. They might well throw him to the Hague
1977 2018-03-14 19:29:19 Oil esa mamada :v
1978 2018-03-14 19:28:54 おつかれです( ´⚰︎` )
1979 2018-03-14 19:28:43 Yeah coconut oil for sure. Just rub that shit on your eyes for a couple minutes and it will all come off.
1980 2018-03-14 19:28:38 I know what happened to the workers when they sprayed poison in the Gulf after the oil spill.. I LOVE seafood but #NoThanks
1981 2018-03-14 19:28:33 WTI oil at $61.12/barrel, +$0.41.
1982 2018-03-14 19:28:21 A clear indication of how PC gov’t failed Albertans during 43 years at the helm. Did nothing to diversify economy & relied totally on oil royalty revenue, which we all know has shrunk dramatically. That is the real reason for Alberta’s job losses.
1983 2018-03-14 19:27:46 I would drink a hot lemon drink as you need to get rid of the oil. Then drink loads of wine ( not sure lemon will work but if you drink loads of wine you won’t care) hahahahah
1984 2018-03-14 19:27:45 Today, in Toronto, I saw an Australian wearing a Midnight Oil t-shirt. What do I win?
1985 2018-03-14 19:27:36 Also, our currency is the petro dollar. If other countries get to where they can sell oil without using US currency then the dollar will crash.
1986 2018-03-14 19:27:35 Re Notley passing legislation & turning off oil pipeline to BC..Don’t Hold Your Breath
Talk is cheap. The NDP in Alberta would never do that to their Bedfellows the NDP in BC. The wine boycott was a silly brief facade with no real impact. Notley gives lip service as does Trudeau
1987 2018-03-14 19:27:26 More to it than that. China as the worlds largest oil importer is going to pay for its imports from Rus, Iran and Saudi in gold backed Yuan.
1988 2018-03-14 19:27:15 Ok @DennysDiner . It's NOT #glutenfree if the potatoes are from the same fryer. The oil kills nothing. #epicfail #GlutenDude @GlutenDude @gfliving @gf_traveller

1994 2018-03-14 19:25:53 Heh heh heh (genuine 'It meeee!' cackle, there). It's the Green People Fruitful Nights night cream. I add a drop of Tamanu oil to it, mix it in & voila. It's for sensitive skin & has no synthetic crap in it, but at the same time it's v. soothing, esp. w/the oil.
1995 2018-03-14 19:25:48 That oil pastels? Really nice work.
1996 2018-03-14 19:25:27 Yeah can't beat a bit of @osmo_uk 
We also like the finish of teak oil on it too
1997 2018-03-14 19:25:15 They do be having no sauce and they try to mask it by having a pool of oil and shit
1998 2018-03-14 19:25:04 We’ll school them again, like we done twice before. Oil fc, forever in United’s shadow.
1999 2018-03-14 19:24:53 White wine and garlic. Chopped cherry or Roma tomatoes - simple. Or lemon, garlic, and olive oil.
2000 2018-03-14 19:24:45 Lovely! I use the lavender baby oil after every shower. Coconut oil is wonderful too, great for the skin. But I'm trying to be extra good to my body when the hormone levels change. Working with my body, not against her. #pmddpeeps
2001 2018-03-14 19:24:37 Pro tip - there are lots of genuine beard oil online. Get one, make sure you follow the instructions as directed, and in no time, the beards will start showing and when it's all fresh, ditch that girl, you deserve better.
2002 2018-03-14 19:24:28 @mjp360 I need to get a oil change for a week #speedwork lol
2003 2018-03-14 19:24:26 The US did this during the oil crisis in the early 70s. People complained that their children were waiting at their school bus stops in the dark.  The idea was scrapped after that. Why not just keep Standard Time year-round?
2004 2018-03-14 19:24:23 My guy has an ointment called redemption he gives out that I LOVE. It’s got coconut oil in it supposedly and works very well on the itchiness.
2005 2018-03-14 19:24:20 You need to try the Kettle Chips made with Avocado Oil and Himalayan Salt. They taste just as good (maybe even better).
2006 2018-03-14 19:23:58 Yes, I was called “Botanne” yesterday and told followers to “slide me some oil”. Real comedians...whatever!!!!  Just motivates me more to get out the vote, protect our rights, support Potus, and red pill as much as possible.
2007 2018-03-14 19:23:47 !!!! Ugh it’s annoying as fuck! My shit deadass to the point that it’s starting to flake so I gotta use a shit load of coconut oil to give some hydration it’s so bad
2008 2018-03-14 19:23:35 #beautytip rub frankincense oil on a skin tact or small mole and it will dry out and fall off in 1-2 weeks. #thanksmom
2009 2018-03-14 19:23:22 Amazing! Prices have changed on stock market. Oh yeah, there is snow warning out, so greedy oil now increases prices!
2010 2018-03-14 19:23:12 1. Get oil catch pan & locate oil pan under car
2. Get drain plug out
3. Drain all oil then unscrew the oil filter
4. Replace oil filter (put oil on gasket on new filter)
5.fill with new oil (don’t forget to screw the drain plug back in)
6. Clean up dispose of old oil properly
2011 2018-03-14 19:23:10 Can you guess how many jobs New Mexico’s oil and natural gas industry is responsible for?
2012 2018-03-14 19:23:01 The Fancy Bear malware that was the first time, landed civilian aircraft on its excessive South China Sea to secure the oil. Your point?
2013 2018-03-14 19:22:54 Thanks for the tip!! My skin gets really dry after my period so I’ve been using baby oil for the last 6 months on my body #pmddpeeps #SelfCare

2020 2018-03-14 19:22:13 Oh no! 48 hrs? I hope it's not another transformer oil vandalism case. What did ZESA @ Mabelreign say is the problem? What is your fault report number please?

2023 2018-03-14 19:21:45 My aunt grows indoor bud, used that to make RSO and makes really potent, delicious (you can't tell there's weed, I know everyone says that; but seriously) and they're inexpensive and HQ. The oil is even better than pot bc there's no flavor tbh

2037 2018-03-14 19:20:03 Then Britain had better get its head out of the sand and start fracking. USA is now virtually independent of outside oil & starting to export it, thanks to drilling and thousands of fracking wells. And out of all these thousands of Wells how many successful lawsuits against them
2038 2018-03-14 19:19:59 same lol 
also there are like slow drying acrylics and stuff that mimic oil
2039 2018-03-14 19:19:49 Not bad, wouldn’t use coconut oil tho bc I can never get it all the way out of my hair
2040 2018-03-14 19:19:47 i got a new cartridge for my oil pen and i’ve taken two tiny hits off of it and i’m so high what the hell hahahaha
2041 2018-03-14 19:19:41 Because the don't get pay to do so! They only get pay by US corporations to get Canadian Oil out of the market!
2042 2018-03-14 19:19:39 I am hooked on the Calm meditation app. I've also been investigating in buying myself a new fancy (but not expensive) body oil or lotion every month as a treat! #pmddpeeps
2043 2018-03-14 19:19:37 DOE today seems the same of the last 2-3 weeks. It feels like that the producers are slowing down the rebalancing. Maybe they are worried about a potential spike of the oil price with all the related inflation effects. D/S are the same... so the marignal variable is clear

2046 2018-03-14 19:19:17 You do realize but so far all of Trump's actions have done far more harm to Russia than anything Hillary "reset" Clinton would have done. Oil production up, Russian profits fall, destroy hundreds of Russian Spetsnaz in Syria, weapons to Ukraine, etc...
2047 2018-03-14 19:18:56 Thank you!!!  In Mandarin we say ‘add oil’ for good luck. Same same.
2048 2018-03-14 19:18:56 Access to oil
2049 2018-03-14 19:18:38 I got rid of my car almost a year ago (I moved to a neighborhood with horrible parking but very close to work) and I’ve never felt more free.  No payments, oil changes, gas, insurance.   It’s amazing!
2050 2018-03-14 19:18:21 Ha, no. But if you were someone who made money selling Scottish gutrot or oil equipment you probably made a sharp intake of breath when you watched the news tonight.

How about now?
2059 2018-03-14 19:17:14 Indeed I do,  I've been making solid pet shampoo bars for years & have amended it slightly for my own hair. Melt down 4oz veg. glycerine soap base, add 2.5 ml Apricot Kernel Oil & 10 ml Castor Oil. Pour into mould & leave to set. Great for hair!

Even for members of the nra, it’s not a big deal. Guns are a big deal, not the nra. This frantic reaction to the nra seems so weird and foreign to me.

2080 2018-03-14 19:13:38 I agree, we ( Canadians) should sell the crude oil we have at fair market prices to the USA.  That means joining OPEC but for you all in the USA that would mean 53% of the oil you buy will suddenly cost double and prices at the pumps would likely hit $8 dollars a gallon US.
2081 2018-03-14 19:13:23 Came to change the oil in my car, started freaking out because I couldn’t find my keys. They have my keys.
2082 2018-03-14 19:13:18 One of the talking points surrounding pipe fights is about buying local ethical oil.
Are you saying that's a lie? Those of us that have done the research know it is. It's not about national interest either. It's all about the harvest and sell resource barons.

2097 2018-03-14 19:11:44 Ran out of butter but still wanted a toasted, buttery hot cross bun so I’ve used some extra virgin olive oil instead. This could be gross, or revolutionary.

2102 2018-03-14 19:11:13 Coconut oil is good for your skin
2103 2018-03-14 19:10:56 @BBCTheOneShow #plastic is made from #oil a #polluting #fossilfuel & creating single use plastic should be totally stopped.
2104 2018-03-14 19:10:47 Yes & I have an oil that curbs appetite, it totally works.

2107 2018-03-14 19:09:53 Had a dream last night that the world was ending and I had to jump into some sort of time machine. It only went back to an ancient civilization where their world was ending and I only had time to say one thing hat would be written for future scholars to read. I said “oil is evil”
2108 2018-03-14 19:09:49 we cannot eat money or drink oil
2109 2018-03-14 19:09:47 Deplaned, moved from T04 to T08. Boarding now #deltaairlines #travelwoes. Previous plane had an oil lick that was not fixed by mechanics in Florida.
2110 2018-03-14 19:09:40 He isn't exactly an oil painting himself
2111 2018-03-14 19:09:30 Waiting for my oil to be changed and this woman is talking uncomfortably loud on the phone about how her most recent physical.  Updates to follow...

2114 2018-03-14 19:09:01 Change your oil 2018
2115 2018-03-14 19:08:42 Have they thought through the fact that school districts get paid on attendance and if these absences (should be unexcused) plus snow days cross a threshold, those Dem-stronghold orgs will LOSE funding ?
2116 2018-03-14 19:08:33 As someone WHO WAS THERE Saturday, not sitting in my Essex cottage drinking fuckboy tea, I say to hell with anyone who doesn’t root for ABSOLUTE FAILURE. I want this house cleaned. I want this house burned to the ground. Then we’re gonna build it back up with Emirate oil money.
2117 2018-03-14 19:08:24 Jiffy lube manager must of thought I was cute or some cuz my last oil change was 73 In Kokomo nap talm bout 93 
2118 2018-03-14 19:08:20 Ok, thanks. I’ll give the mink oil a try. Someone from you DC store recommended saddle soap so I tried that but no dice.

2120 2018-03-14 19:08:15 #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateAction A big fan of Motorsport but this goes too far. 8 days of this at the Barcelona F1 test and the FIA and F1 doesn’t see a thing wrong with it? Illegal. Ticketed and towed! Todt claims he solved the oil burn dilemma THIS WAY?  How utterly dumb.
2121 2018-03-14 19:08:15 So answer me this - are you gonna give the oil money back then....?

... I'll wait. *Starts Drumroll With Hands On Desk*
2122 2018-03-14 19:08:10 oil!! thank you!!

2125 2018-03-14 19:07:54 #LarryKudlow very articulate economist, but he advocated for Iraq War on #CNBC "just think of all that cheap oil" before oil prices soared.
2126 2018-03-14 19:07:39 I appreciate that he named his villains after dad jokes. "The Duke of Oil." "The Force of July."
2127 2018-03-14 19:07:09 You clearly know that this fee has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself, which costs 1-2 Satoshis a byte to transact with right now. You're trying so hard with your snake oil salesman schtick, yet you're not outwitting anyone.
2128 2018-03-14 19:07:05 And GT’s “Lets throw an oil tanker down a dry flume “ attempt is, Well, It looks nice. #PatsThemOnTheHead But still V-rally has to compete with @dirtgame & @wrcthegame , Will V be sim or arcade, we shall see :)
2129 2018-03-14 19:06:50 Feeling very squared away after having my car’s oil changed over my lunch break today

2132 2018-03-14 19:06:12 These stories are about to become the new "pipeline spills X gallons of oil after regulators assure safety" ones.

2136 2018-03-14 19:05:42 Inflamation within our bodies cause a whole host of long term health problems and taking #cbdoil is one of the most natural ways of eliminating inflammation, I have been on a non thc isolate cbd oil for nearly a yr and I have noticed so many positive changes

2144 2018-03-14 19:04:42 Getting an oil change and if I here this guy tell this lady to buy a car one more time I might go run across rt 6
2145 2018-03-14 19:04:36 Regulations don't ensure safety, even if they are properly crafted. I wonder why it's so hard for these commies to understand.

2147 2018-03-14 19:04:30 I’m sitting and waiting for my car to get an oil change done and this elderly man walks in and goes, “My lungs are so bad I can only chase a woman when she’s on a walker!” 
2148 2018-03-14 19:04:26 Why not an expose on how oil companies tried to hide evidence of global warming forty years ago?
2149 2018-03-14 19:04:19 I like rosemary oil more than tiger balm for instant relief but I have that too. And arnica.   Emergen-C saves lives too (and it's great for hangovers.)
2150 2018-03-14 19:04:08 Insane amount to pay for gas, considering that the oil/gas reserves are next door, in Alberta!

2153 2018-03-14 19:03:25 make up remover bisa. tapi kalo make upnya yg heavy like wedding make up, graduation make up, micellar ga begitu ngatasin. mending pake yg oil base. ))
2154 2018-03-14 19:03:14 Interesting point:#Russia's control over the passage in #Syria for gas and oil pipelines will put #Qatar and #Iran in a pickle to use this passage towards #Turkey and #Europe without the blessing of #Putin.
2155 2018-03-14 19:03:13 Ahh laura. I know u got to make a living. But any CBD oil that can be shipped legally to all 50 states is JUNK. You must have 100% min 3000 mg to do any good. 5000 and 10000 is even better.

2162 2018-03-14 19:02:08 Also whatever you do DO NOT purchase the “Baby Unscented” flavor (flavor?) because it smells like olive oil and I’ve been a walking salad for two weeks cause it’s to expensive not to use
2163 2018-03-14 19:01:55 Happy Pi day! #π #DYK nearly 20% of all current U.S. jobs require STEM skills and or training? Celebrate 3.14 by giving us a RT to recognize the wonderful men and women working in the oil and natural gas industry.

2170 2018-03-14 19:01:13 I did all my research in the height of coconut oil worship but think jojoba is supposed to be good, it is a bit of trial and error though because it really depends on what actually works when you try it

2172 2018-03-14 19:01:09 Is coconut oil bad 4 u? Does coffee cause cancer? What’s better- dark or milk chocolate? With so much info in the media it’s hard to determine what’s what! That’s where RDs & RDNs come in- we can help make sense of all the madness and lead you on the path of health and wellness!

2181 2018-03-14 19:00:11 The Feds told TransCanada that the pipeline project had to justify the emissions from the consumers burning the oil, even though TCPL had no control over that.

2191 2018-03-14 18:59:09 rUK will still be 6th largest economy without Scotland and if Sterling rises as expected then 5th. The rUK economy is very diverse and doesn't depend on oil. Some English regions have same GDP as Scotland, London 3x. The rUK will do very well saving £13b+ each year but... 1/2
2192 2018-03-14 18:59:02 Is this the secret of the Mediterranean diet?  So nothing to do with olive oil and red wine! 
2193 2018-03-14 18:58:38 Girl just use some unscented lotion or any cooking oil you have at this point
2194 2018-03-14 18:58:37 I hear Sweat Almond oil is amazing also.
2195 2018-03-14 18:58:22 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

2202 2018-03-14 18:57:48 Did You Know?
#PepperSpray is based on an oil known as "oleoresin capsicum" Capsaicin, the inflammatory agent in the oil, is the same chemical that makes chilli peppers hot.
2203 2018-03-14 18:57:34 No one believes this lol...the words and actions tell us otherwise
2204 2018-03-14 18:57:30 Hey Kudlow, piece of advice: trumpolino likes simple yet colorful drawings and junk food. So draw nice macroeconomics pie charts on the actual pie boxes...and use the  dirty napkins to represent how trump’s businesses can soak up the sweet oil of profit from the gov. Good luck!

2208 2018-03-14 18:57:15 @CNBCnow  What a joke the Harold Hamm interview was. Really, a shale oil billionaire says donnie the commie conman is an "excellent negotiator"!  Where on earth is there proof of that?  donnie is a LIAR CONMAN and the easily suckered and oil men, believe him.

2210 2018-03-14 18:57:11 I miss the way it was there's a lot safer. Checking the airplane to make sure there wasn't a lot of water in the gas making sure the water was regulated for the engine. Making sure the oil is okay checking the other ones before takeoff checking the rudder. Pre checking the plane
2211 2018-03-14 18:56:56 Have you tried washing your face with coconut oil? I have been having awful hormonal acne and it is really helping me. Got worse before it got better though.
2212 2018-03-14 18:56:54 No it isn’t, it is people seeing through his snake oil routine.

2216 2018-03-14 18:56:22 Big oil fuels our homes and cars and makes everything run in America! Only a fool who wants to reenter the dark ages would be against oil!!
2217 2018-03-14 18:56:21 Deaths by the government or just by other citizens? Because in the mass murder Olympics, we’re the Jamaican bobsled team.
2218 2018-03-14 18:55:47 When I dropped coconut oil, my folicies started flourishing.
2219 2018-03-14 18:55:45 @ABDanielleSmith Further to your show this morning, every American President since Nixon has made it a goal to reduce dependence on foreign oil, yet here in Canada our policy seems to be to increase dependence.  gov has made us a nation of suckers!
2220 2018-03-14 18:55:41 Day off but oil change & museum for school  i cant win
2221 2018-03-14 18:55:11 Whats mct oil?

2223 2018-03-14 18:54:51 Good time to cut out some waste! Have you ever seen what Exxon and other oil companies pay in taxes and collect in taxes on behalf of the IRS? The amount they'll save is rather miniscule. I'm wide awake thanks!
2224 2018-03-14 18:54:47 The exact opposite of the truth
Continuing oil expansion will create countless crop failures leading to mass starvation
But you don't even care about that
Greed trumps everything
2225 2018-03-14 18:54:44 Its never to late to say WE F&^%K UP. Reverse course now. Pay the seperation commitment and move on. The wall and this train is beyond stupid. I could understand texas: san antonio, austin, dallas, and houston having one of these. but oil companies wouldnt allow it
2226 2018-03-14 18:54:36 I was but my grandma Lotion was running out so I used some of her Body oil then I wanted some more pleasure so I used Shampoo by accident that was my downfall 
2227 2018-03-14 18:54:29 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables i wonder what baby oil is made from?
2228 2018-03-14 18:54:21 Not long America is gonna have a ‘space force ‘ but what intrigues me who are they gonna fight ? Guess there ain’t oil in the space lol
2229 2018-03-14 18:54:00 Maybe he runs like a Republican now but watch is voting record once in- also voters need to understand the critical importance of maintaining control- don’t be fooled- Lamb is a snake oil salesman #MAGA #KAG @mitchellvii
2230 2018-03-14 18:53:56 Pathos and ethos in equal measure. Had to admire him despite being raised in an oil family and knowing how utterly amoral the executive class of the industry can be.
2231 2018-03-14 18:53:48 Different kinds of oil
2232 2018-03-14 18:53:41 and in doing so you avoid the issue that we have increased demand for crude on the West Coast that will be met by less safe means (lower regulated tankers in US waters and oil-by-rail)
2233 2018-03-14 18:53:05 The company I lease my car from trusts me enough to let me take one of their cars to pick up their client while my oil was getting changed. 
I feel like a badass 
2234 2018-03-14 18:53:03 @wienerschnitzel What oil do you use in your fryers?
2235 2018-03-14 18:53:03 And much of the growth during Reagan's presidency didn't have anything to do with Reagan or taxes at all; it had to do with the fed moving away from contractionary policy intended to control inflation from the supply side shocks of the oil crises in '73 and '79.

2238 2018-03-14 18:52:10 Today I got a $1000 increase on my credit line, Romeo got an oil change and transmission flush, Friday is payday and will be the first one with my raise on it, and I told my boss that I was going to be sick Friday so it’s a 4 day week. I’m kicking ass adulting 
2239 2018-03-14 18:52:08 So true. Indeed there are good examples. In SK, oil majors are actively building clean energy projects to reduce their carbon tax liability. One way or another, total emissions will come down.
2240 2018-03-14 18:51:50 It's true.
Their only resource of value they have after running out of AK's to sell to every other country is oil and natural gas which is why they vehemently oppose clean energies because they will destroy them outright.
2241 2018-03-14 18:51:50 Edward Snowden.   Do you know how to bake a chocolate cake?  I was thinking that you really could.   You just go to the Dollar General and buy some chocolate cake mix on sale for one dollar.  Then, you add egg, water, and oil and bake.  They have ready made frosting too.  It just

2243 2018-03-14 18:51:46 Oil and wet tots
2244 2018-03-14 18:51:31 90 minute wait just for an oil change .... that’s craaaazyyy
2245 2018-03-14 18:51:23 "Sir Ian Wood states that Scotland's oil will drop from 1.6billion barrels a day down to 200million". Clearly a statement of the obvious from a bampot! The pertinent Q is WHEN will it reach 200m? 100 yrs? 500 yrs? 1000 yrs?
2246 2018-03-14 18:51:18 I wanna be friends with the guys who work at the oil change place I go to. They’re so funny I love them
2247 2018-03-14 18:51:10 When you end up in a 2-star donut shop because it started raining and your car is currently getting an oil change.
2248 2018-03-14 18:51:08 Maybe you can buy a cleanser in a home-store? Specific for furniture made of leather? Or try some oil since most makeups are oily.

2251 2018-03-14 18:50:58 The people at the Chevrolet dealership were super nice when I went in for an oil change just now. Made me me feel like a responsible adult lol.
2252 2018-03-14 18:50:52 I finally had to do the thing I’ve been avoiding since I’ve gotten my first car...getting the oil changed 
2253 2018-03-14 18:50:49 That's precisely why it is great to have him as a secreteray of state. Oil money won't rule US politics anymore and, perhaps, some pressures are gonna finally be made on Abbas and other gangsters ruling the so called "Palestinian" authority ( the racket of the century )
2254 2018-03-14 18:50:49 Sautéed in few TB olive oil in large covered skillet. Add diced onion, minced garlic and rosemary. When tender add fresh grated Parmesan cheese and salt and pepper to taste. Yum!
2255 2018-03-14 18:50:43 And for that we need steel. So let's rebuild our steel industry the tariffs will help. #MAGA.  PERFECT time to invest in steel, concrete, iron, oil,transportation, well basically everything. Pround to be an American #PTBAA
2256 2018-03-14 18:50:43 It is estimated that the oil and gas industry only measures 3% of potential data. #IoT has potential to revolutionise that - Dr Liane Smith FREng, VP Digital Solutions, @WoodGroup #RAEngdigital #RAEngdigital
2257 2018-03-14 18:50:29 Penalties have to be heavy enough that it’s worth them hauling it and not just paying it and continue hauling oil which I’m told pays more.
2258 2018-03-14 18:50:29 Olive oil is better than industrial oils I suppose. I get all my fat from animal sources so I personally don't use it.
2259 2018-03-14 18:50:17 My hair is mad thick so it kinda sits. I really like it when I combine it with grapeseed oil tho. I'll try something else to test tho
2260 2018-03-14 18:50:13 In the warehouse where I work, I managed to spill 10 gallons of oil with a forklift on the floor..my supervisor, conveniently, happened to be right there to see it...on the one day out of the month that he shows up.....

Do you have oil based eye makeup remover ?????
2262 2018-03-14 18:50:02 Clean energy already provides more jobs than oil in Canada and the US. We need a good just transition plan that will support working families during the transition. Expanding now just makes the transition more difficult.
2263 2018-03-14 18:49:45 unions, big business, and oil firms.
2264 2018-03-14 18:49:43 That...is the crime here. #Wutangclan
2265 2018-03-14 18:49:37 I remember when I lived outside LA and would see this man driving around in his Hummer. That I think got two miles per gallon. Yeah, he's a real hater of oil.
2266 2018-03-14 18:49:36 Or maybe it’s for that reason that Cali ranks higher than COUNTRIES on an economic scale. Texas is the land of oil & has no sales tax as a result of their economic size. Imagine what they could be if they governed like Cali. You repubs are holding yourselves back w/ your bigotry.
2267 2018-03-14 18:49:16 DPRK appears to be paying for oil with political copywriting gigs. Smart.
2268 2018-03-14 18:48:50 I was driving my car for almost a week with absolutely no oil....and my car didn’t give me a single problem I love her
2269 2018-03-14 18:48:42 Basically take a soap opera, give it a heaping dose of HGH and testosterone, put everyone in spandex, slather oil all over their bodies, and then have them yell nonsense at each other, then pummel each other in the ring until one of them is choked out or pinned. Repeat ad nauseum

2271 2018-03-14 18:48:29 something i nev3er quite understood about newer cars moving to electronic handbrakes.

e-Brake stood for emergency brake, meant to  work when nothing else did due to oil pressure issues etc. having that break be electronically controlled is worse than that previous style.

2285 2018-03-14 18:46:28 I hope #SXSW will question the snake oil and anti-science and why it should even be connected to SX--isn't it ironic that a festival that heavily features tech and science should support magic water (homeopathy)?
2286 2018-03-14 18:46:27 The Saudis fund the building of mosques, finance imams whom spew their mantra, & even get away with doing away with people just like the Russians, but they have OIL, & they SPEND them oil $$ so its all mitigatable.
2287 2018-03-14 18:46:26 Coal ?????? Why not whale oil ??????
2288 2018-03-14 18:46:25 Russia has oil and gas. Saudi Arabia has oil and gas. Iran has oil and gas and wants more. WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON THERE JEFF?

2296 2018-03-14 18:45:52 I deal with some Construction related works in Oil and Gas sector... Almost all Contractors, Workers and Labourers speak in Hindi only...

2298 2018-03-14 18:45:40 1. There were no free electionsw and only one party allowed (Rastakhiz)
2.  Communists, liberals, nationalists and Islamists were persecuted.
3. There was no free and independent media.
4. It was  illegal for women to wear chador.
5. The oil money was for the Shah and his cronies
2299 2018-03-14 18:45:26 Don't buy Russian oil and gases the only effective Russian sanction. Only problem is that the lights would go off across Europe. The EU is never going to go down that road. Shoulder to shoulder.... Oh, wait!

2310 2018-03-14 18:43:55 When oil was over $100 a barrel and the petro-dollars were flowing in...you and I could have managed the economy. But Harper didn’t diversify. Our economy was totally petro-based, and now it’s stagnant. Alberta is now broke.
2311 2018-03-14 18:43:55 not all of it! I just can't afford oil paint supplies, so I do more of my "painterly" stuff digitally. all my drawings, and ink paintings, and water color paintings are physical.

2326 2018-03-14 18:42:15 Solved the oil burn problem? That’s not what the Barcelona testing video shows with the Ferrari billowing a blue haze like a old  Chevy. That should impress the green movement and viewers.  One step forward and two back. Cant be enviro compliant. #fia #f1 #climate #airquality
2327 2018-03-14 18:42:12 Definitely oil next time 
2328 2018-03-14 18:42:09 This is the correct response. Olive oil, kosher salt, and cracked pepper at 350F for two hours for 3lbs of halved sprouts.
2329 2018-03-14 18:42:05 Someone has to help poor oil barons.
2330 2018-03-14 18:41:30 When is the conversation going to start on Wind and Solar energy ? Why the focus is still on the dying Oil and Gas industry ?
2331 2018-03-14 18:41:27 Roasted with a little olive oil and some diced bacon. At least that’s how I roll.
2332 2018-03-14 18:41:24 Try oil cleansing with sweet almond oil or jojoba oil. It’s helped me out a lot.

4) add to boiling cauldron of tears, coconut oil, & hair (or feathers) of nemesis 
5) simmer 20 min. 
6) allow to cool & bathe in mixture #amwriting

I remember then the famous one was *Nigeria with a population with a high rate of consumption *

2352 2018-03-14 18:39:46 I feel bad now: I was trying to write the blandest possible plov recipe that I could. But, for making a good soffritto, browning the celery and carrots (+ the onion I have to leave out) in oil the instant pot, then cooking under pressure for 10 minutes makes them amazing.
2353 2018-03-14 18:39:46 That's what I was thinking although I have heard of a modulating oil burner.

2356 2018-03-14 18:39:35 And look how far we have come. Real heroes and their sacrifices have been reduced to nothing, while a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, a serial sexual assaulter, a 5x draft dodger, agrabber was elected as the potus.
2357 2018-03-14 18:39:29 Hi Julia! Leather, being a natural material, is very prone to wear and tear from friction, moisture, sunlight, and other environmental factors. If you bought the watch new from us, it came with a small tin of mink oil that you can use to condition the strap, though it will darken
2358 2018-03-14 18:39:23 Yes, it can definitely be used as a toner but its also a spritz for skin that might need some hydration. For example, if you have oily skin, it’s useful in balancing out oil production and keeping skin fresh!
2359 2018-03-14 18:39:08 And people wounder why Westminster want to hang onto scotland , just add a couple of more thing's to it like our whisky and our oil and they are laugjing at us scottish .

2364 2018-03-14 18:38:53 So what? The only thing that matters is how much TAX is raised from it. Tax rates are very low (Swinney begged for that), and there are many allowances to be offset against tax - decommissioning e.g. The net income to the Treasury from oil will be small.
2365 2018-03-14 18:38:25 Add some Black Seed Oil and Colloidal Silver and you’re extra good.
2366 2018-03-14 18:38:18 Just because we currently heat with fossil fuels it doesn't mean we will to the same extent in the future now that we understand the impact. And maybe it is better to purchase a cleaner oil. The Saudis have lots yet also building solar given so much sun. It isn't all or nothing.

2371 2018-03-14 18:37:34 But *why*? Because women choose professions that pay less -and particularly avoid professions that are dirty & dangerous (oil rigging, military, construction, mining, taxi driving)
2372 2018-03-14 18:37:31 Yes St Jeremy of Corbyn’s Labour. He is a Unionist like the Tories. And a Brexiteer. Knows he cannot make a deal without Scotland’s Resources. Will sell the Fishermen for a dirty deal with America. Will squander Scotland’s Oil. He comes to Scotland and lies. Lies all the time.

2378 2018-03-14 18:36:31 Science is theory until it is proven.  Evolution is theory.  What God wants me to do is in the Bible, not in your head.  My granddaughter is a scientist, she has told me all about theory.  Not interested in a Science degree.  I know snake oil when I see it.
2379 2018-03-14 18:36:06 Holy fuck I’m gonna go to Alamo botanicals hopefully next week to try and get some CBD oil for my costochondritis and I’m so excited this could really be it I cannot wait to feel better again
2380 2018-03-14 18:35:51 But why my coworker let me hit her oil pen at work and I was literally out of it 
2381 2018-03-14 18:35:23 Philly K. Bic, need to get a book at the lie berry. Black gold, is the network, oil, money. School, doesn't really let you renew. Must start a new account there. Not a reference to making a new profile. I still don't watch movies.
2382 2018-03-14 18:35:22 I also encourage PLAIN magnesium and adding lavender essential oil / Edens garden is an great affordable one that is pretty clean however young living is the best I have found
2383 2018-03-14 18:35:19 Thanks Calen, that taught me a lot that I never knew.  But then again I didn't know the background to Midnight Oil's Beds Are Burning til much later either, just thought it was a great song 
2384 2018-03-14 18:35:19 By the end of the year, I, Ned Braden, predict that Wiles will be involved in a Gigolo sex ring that serves those that have dangerous sex with liberal use of gun oil with bible readings in the background read in Russian. With Russian dressing.

2397 2018-03-14 18:33:49 Does anyone here use coconut oil for their hair?
2398 2018-03-14 18:33:47 To enrich the blood-suckers--the #Oligarchy--and remember, the #DeepState puppets are already hinting at population reduction & de-population of oil-mineral-water rich lands around #PlanetEarth: They'll not be happy until many of us go #POOF & they've stolen what little we have.
2399 2018-03-14 18:33:45 The federal government can't correct the oil industry's self-inflicted shooting itself in the head/foot when it caused a global glut of oil and gas. In the meantime, the federal government did fork over a couple of billion in special EI  benefits.
2400 2018-03-14 18:33:32 Geography practical at uni of Birmingham (a Russel group uni) was ultimately OIL AND WATER DONT MIX and SOAP LETS THEM MIX and this can be used to clean up oil spills BUT ITS ALSO KINDA BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT (I'm not impressed?)

2417 2018-03-14 18:31:35 Take Saudi Aramco out of the list. With the system of government of Saudi Arabia, there is no way they won't make money. Again take off Norway, they're a model of oil resource development. Petrobas is reeked with same corruption like NNPC just that they have better system.
2418 2018-03-14 18:31:32 It literally doesn’t take an hour and a half for an oil change... it just doesn’t.

2441 2018-03-14 18:30:11 Yes a plan needs to be in place to transition over to clean energy for sure. Until that happens ( and it won't be overnight as you say) then why should we be an importer of oil when we have it?

2448 2018-03-14 18:29:48 You have a right to be cynical. But. Wmd was driven by oil and a desire by Blair (with which I sympathise) to ally with the US. This time there is no motivation bar involving ourselves in a battle we could well do without. And then there's corbyn... He never sides with UK

2450 2018-03-14 18:29:34 I'll always remember that I was on my very long road trip work vacation to LA, getting the oil change, when I found out Stephen Hawking died. I'm pretty sad but so happy we had him for so long too. RIP. [trying not to cry too much at the mechanic shop]
2451 2018-03-14 18:29:28 About time I got an oil change on my car 
2452 2018-03-14 18:29:05 Agreed. Oil Bell of all people should have known better as surely he could see what we could see that Tiger Roll was obviously struggling. Just glad TG recovered well and all was ok#thehorsecomesfirst
2453 2018-03-14 18:29:04 Saudi Arabia is wealthy largely because of its state own oil, gas and petrol company.. even though the oil price is volatile and 'risky'.. Cyril misled you on nationalization

2458 2018-03-14 18:28:34 Toasting is one way. Another is to saute the rice with seasoning, onions, and/or herbs for infused goodness. Stocks/broths in lieu of water can also add depth and flavor. Butter and oil during boiling creates softer and fluffier rice.

2462 2018-03-14 18:28:15 I get it, and I’m not sure that I can quantify why I’m feeling iffy on it. I feel like this won’t change anything in DC cuz they’re checking their oil Andre-style, so more extreme demonstrations will be planned. I guess I’m forecasting the outcome and I don’t have a great feeling
2463 2018-03-14 18:28:11 I'm super optimistic. I've heard a few speeches from these kids, they're very blunt about NRA lobbying and lawmaker passivity. It's not inconceivable that they might soon make that connection with other massive/damaging industries, namely oil/gas and securities.
2464 2018-03-14 18:27:40 So many little druggys share them 'cannabis oil is curing cancer' stories like yeah u do realise that's not the same as sitting in ur mums house getting stoned everyday hun
2465 2018-03-14 18:27:38 Yes please! Although I'm sure we can negotiate the fee? The thing with oil in Colombia is that Ecopetrol is a mixed stock-holding corporation (88 percent governmental entities and 12 percent private), so the government has a big interest in the company growing...
2466 2018-03-14 18:27:16 In Nigeria, that is. Statoil, Aramco, Petrobras are profitable state-owned oil companies in Norway, Saudi and Brazil respectively.
2467 2018-03-14 18:27:08 I bet he calls AAA road side assistance when he gets a flat tire. Real men can change a flat, change the oil, build something cool with their hand for their woman, and pull out a gun to protect her, instead of pulling out that Phone and calling 911. Handle things then call 911.
2468 2018-03-14 18:27:07 That's not the fence he's using.  Those plants will adapt. As will the animals. Mexico's oil goop that covers the beaches there is &has created worse problems
2469 2018-03-14 18:26:46 The customer care service of Indian Oil, which provides Indane LPG domestic gas, is nothing but a farce and makes mockery of customers. Every time you call them, you get to listen thousand of voices because of cross connection. @IndianOilcl

2480 2018-03-14 18:25:18 Agreed. Those who want to transition away from oil need to recognize that oil will still be used for decades to come – makes no sense to block Canadian companies from having a chance to sell their product.

2497 2018-03-14 18:22:21 You think the Russians would use one of their most traceable weapons when they could have easily hired a common criminal to run them over for a few pounds?

2500 2018-03-14 18:22:11 @ToyotaofDallas so, why make an appointment for an oil change if i’m here for an hour and a half and it’s not done? why am i here? why shouldn’t i go somewhere else? because next time i will.

2504 2018-03-14 18:21:42 Great talk on #STEM needs in the future. "Data is the 'new' oil" - as Technology evolves we need to invest on strategies to analyze and interact with data. - Dawn Tilbury #SWEAdvocacy @SWETalk
2505 2018-03-14 18:21:38 if your goal is to keep veggies in your diet, many of them (broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, Brussels sprouts, carrots, etc) go super well with simply some oil and minced garlic, sautéed or baked (usually 30-40 mins at 350).
2506 2018-03-14 18:21:22 I WANT A SAALAAAAAAD A REAL ONE WITHOUT ANY PASTA IN IT WITH LEMON AND RED PEPPER AND OLIVE OIL AND TOMATOS AND GARLOC IN IT
2507 2018-03-14 18:21:05 Crazy we live in a time when an oil tycoon can be sympathized for. Wow. I mean, give credit its dues and what not, but I'm astonished how the bar keeps getting lower. Improving after falling under the negative still puts you there. Sorry, existential moment of frustration.
2508 2018-03-14 18:21:02 Do my oil change for me 
2509 2018-03-14 18:20:57 I'll always remember that I was on my very long road trip work vacation to LA, getting the oil change, when I found out Stephen Hawking died. I'm pretty sad but so happy we had him for so long too. RIP. [trying not to cry too much at the mechanic shop]
2510 2018-03-14 18:20:51 Yes, USA, a government is bombing other country. Oil counties are not bombing anyone. You have problems with governments not with capitalism.
2511 2018-03-14 18:20:51 3rd in oil reserves and it just sits in the ground, senseless
2512 2018-03-14 18:20:50 The budget will always keep expanding, the state is required to provide more social services each year. And you’re right, oil and gas should stop receiving subsidies and should be taxed more :^)
2513 2018-03-14 18:20:45 One night rough. Next night rough. 3rd night rough. Bj day. 4th night sensual oil massage. 5th, Hitachi night. 6th, shower 3some. 7th, more rough, but with an on the butts...all three.
2514 2018-03-14 18:20:43 My babe is too much. He came to get my car from work and left his here so that he could wash mine, fill it up, and get the oil changed. He is SCREAMING MY LOVE LANGUAGE FROM THE HILLS! #Service 
2515 2018-03-14 18:20:33 What about salt, olive oil, and vinegar? I’m not really a dressing fan either but like that.
2516 2018-03-14 18:20:30 Use Lemon and Olive oil plus peppers
2517 2018-03-14 18:20:27 How am I just seeing this ugh!!! Ya I do, but I’m going to get my oil changed on mine 
2518 2018-03-14 18:20:15 $43 for an oil change at Prompto? No thanks. Last time I go there
2519 2018-03-14 18:20:10 may I ask why the coconut oil?
2520 2018-03-14 18:20:08 @KoinangeJeff Maybe this can be another sign of oil presence at the narok-mai mahiu road. I also think that minerals like gold might be underneath. I think the government should exploit an economic option before fixing the fault #JKLive
2521 2018-03-14 18:19:55 @chillissaaa ur grapeseed oil tip is working wonders on my skin
2522 2018-03-14 18:19:47 How does that matter? Do you agree or disagree with my views? Has the price of bread, taxi fares, cooking oil, sugar, fuel shot up by more than 6 times in past 9 years?
2523 2018-03-14 18:19:46 3000 active oil wells in Los Angeles county.  They're pumping oil under the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills...
2524 2018-03-14 18:19:40 Good chunk of NE US energy was produced with oil this winter, despite NG next door.  Some from Russia, despite sanctions.

Minimal Russian investment in anti-fossil fuel and nuke groups pays massive dividends.  Was particularly effective in Poland.

2528 2018-03-14 18:19:33 We could apparently have oil, lots of it, no fracking ...Up on the Weald east sussex...
2529 2018-03-14 18:19:22 I need aloe vera, witch hazel, and tea tree oil PRONTO !
2530 2018-03-14 18:19:16 Better to campaign against fossil fuel subsidies, to level the playing field. The divestment drive is misguided - someone else will buy the shares right? Net result; Feel good? Yes. Impact? Zero! While there is demand, likely still for decades, oil and gas will be produced.
2531 2018-03-14 18:19:04 I don't have a medical background, but after my LASIK my doctor recommended the omega-3 fish-oil stuff, and he doesn't have any obvious incentive to push snake oil.  But I'm always suspicious of such things...  (I do take the fish oil.)

2534 2018-03-14 18:18:49 My mom just opened my door and said "Hey, want to see a messy room?" And then showed my room to an acquaintance I didn't even know was here... 

The heck? I'm still in my pjs and I have coconut oil in my hair I look terrible... 

Also, yes, my room is a mess. 

#why #ugh
2535 2018-03-14 18:18:47 @NissanRaleigh terrible ‘service’  -had an appt but waited 2 hours for oil change...then you recommended brake pads...another 2 1/2 hours!
2536 2018-03-14 18:18:38 Poor Rex will have to go back to being an oil billionaire
2537 2018-03-14 18:18:35 Why?? Evidence?? Remember Iraq. This is about Syria, Iran, oil/gas, NATO expansion, public opinion and demonising Russia and then China. They affect spheres of interest. It also avoids domestic scrutiny of policies+Brexit.
2538 2018-03-14 18:18:11 I have heard these are great, a little oil is enough and nothing sticks to it. They are also great looking, would love to have a set as I have big family. They would be great for every kind of cooking :)
2539 2018-03-14 18:18:10 Tasted hemp oil for the first time plain. It tastes like sunflower seeds.
2540 2018-03-14 18:17:55 Car rides so much smoother after an oil change 
2541 2018-03-14 18:17:48 Best thing is that I got my edibles and mentrual oil thru ...so yayyyy 
2542 2018-03-14 18:17:37 What all services will be provided? Just oil and tire checks? Or full multipoint inspections
2543 2018-03-14 18:17:30 At present Britain is the only country in the world opposing Russian expansion. The President of US is pro Russia, France, Germany & all EU are afraid of Russia who control their oil & gas supplies. This test is showing who in the democratic West really stand on the right side.
2544 2018-03-14 18:17:30 Yet nothing you do will help pull much-needed oil and natural gas from the depths of our earth, so. Go twirl and feel mighty.
2545 2018-03-14 18:17:30 Afrim is fundamental. The Kurds also control other strategic areas such as Raqqa. The enclave of #Afrin, would allow them, through a corridor, to pass reinforcements from the Kurdish territories of eastern Syria. Trump wants the Turkish oil and sells for it the Kurds
2546 2018-03-14 18:17:24 wow look at me getting my oil changed and my car inspection all alone!!
2547 2018-03-14 18:17:24 And be applauded by the left

2549 2018-03-14 18:17:09 just found hella poetry, philosophy, history books, and some oil pastel colors!
2550 2018-03-14 18:17:07 Your rapeseed oil is great in lots of dishes - curry, pesto and lots more!
2551 2018-03-14 18:17:06 One study found that sunflower seed oil reduces surfactant-induced in vivo #skin irritation more than mineral oil. #skincare #beauty
2552 2018-03-14 18:16:41 The reason is simple: the control of oil fields. In the #Rojava a large part of the Syrian oil is concentrated. In this area they provided over 300 thousand barrels a day. A treasure that nobody wants to give up.
2553 2018-03-14 18:16:40 We also get a lot of aviation fuel from Russia. Unconventional Oil and Gas can provide UK with shale derived aviation fuel and LNG
2554 2018-03-14 18:16:36 Great thread! ?: Do public data reveal the API of oil in storage? In other words, can you TELL when good oil is coming out of storage and bad oil is replacing it from available inventory data? Is average API of oil in Cushing know, for example? Would love to see that chart!
2555 2018-03-14 18:16:11 I hate when people be like, I want no lettuce, no veggies, no cheese, no meat, no oil, no bread.... like ahhhh!!!!! Eat shit then. 
2556 2018-03-14 18:16:05 I am prepared to reveal my oil prince money

2558 2018-03-14 18:15:50 Pretty sad when wheel alignments become a regular thing with oil changes living in  PA.
2559 2018-03-14 18:15:34 How about dream prevention? Is there an essential oil for that
2560 2018-03-14 18:15:31 When haven't they exploited communal interests for the City of London. Norway, awash with oil money spent on it's citizens.  UK, piss it up a wall.
2561 2018-03-14 18:15:20 pasta can be silly cheap, but add your own special flavors. you can redefine your sauce by sticking it in a pot with some browned ground beef or sausage, some basil and oregano, bit of oil and any other spices and simmer it for a couple hours.
2562 2018-03-14 18:15:16 You have to experiment a little with the amount of oil and cooking times, but it’s a great alternative to oven baked. It’s also a huge timesaver
2563 2018-03-14 18:15:11 And some haven't had a school shooting since the 90's. Meanwhile we've had at least 18 since the beginning of the year.
2564 2018-03-14 18:15:04 My colleague and I typically get called for vertebrate paleontology impact assessments, with our specialty being vertebrate tracks. Since our work involves disturbed rock, natural resource companies (oil, gas, coal, gravel pits, wind turbine sites) are who we hear from the most.

2566 2018-03-14 18:14:52 Do you have a list of hundreds of scientific orgs supporting your science denial concepts?
No Ucan only come up with corrupted individuals who are likely big oil benefactors

Not only is your understanding of science delusional, U don't even understand where to find real science

2570 2018-03-14 18:14:48 CASTOR OIL CAN HELP U WITH THAT HAHAHA

2572 2018-03-14 18:14:36 Don’t give me no black women with blonde weave. No. Give me that nappy shit where you gotta use 1/2 of tube of pink oil moisturizer... I need my black women smelling like berries and glistening.
2573 2018-03-14 18:14:35 funny..if USA quit spying on allies, tracking normal citizens movements (waste of $ and violates 1st amendment, quit creating wars around the world for oil..(always with their hands in the cookie jar)they would have no worries

2580 2018-03-14 18:13:58 Things are never so simple friends. No need to battle carb or fat as real answer is typical std western diet is full of sugar and unrefined carb, oil and animal foods, along with sedentary life, chronic stress, lack of sleep makes for a deadly combo which causes diabesity.
2581 2018-03-14 18:13:56 Fair point about BP and its substantial share of Russia national oil Co.
2582 2018-03-14 18:13:51 Control of the mind is getting burned by frying oil thats popping from the stove and not scream those four-letter words we all know..

2587 2018-03-14 18:13:09 Just to get my oil change is so expensive
2588 2018-03-14 18:13:01 Nah let them make it with palm oil and you’re finished lol
2589 2018-03-14 18:12:57 You mean for Mobil Oil
2590 2018-03-14 18:12:23 Biofuel displaces over 10% of gasoline and diesel in the US.  Thats a lot of crude oil not being consumed and historically imported.  Consumers NET benefit, as cost of biofuel blending is offset with lower crude oil (and gasoline and diesel).
2591 2018-03-14 18:12:16 If I told you that a store of value used by terrorist organisations is oil would you sell all your cars and start moving around with bycicles or what?
#bitcoin $btc
What if I told you that another one is taking loans from banks through corrupted employees and scam accounts?
2592 2018-03-14 18:12:03 Minimum balance charge is unethical loot of money !The people who impose such unethical charge go to hell & yamdoot fry them in boiling oil!
2593 2018-03-14 18:11:59 do it and put castor oil every night it will them them grow a bit !
2594 2018-03-14 18:11:45 My explanation kit is:
- Putin *really* hates Clinton. It was not to make Trump win. It was to make her lose. 
- De-stabilizing world order allows them to influence global geopolitics. Always good. 
- Russian Oligarchs know peak oil is coming. They're looting everything they can.
2595 2018-03-14 18:11:43 In that case why does the oil industry need to spend so much on lobbyists?
2596 2018-03-14 18:11:37 If carbon tax was used strictly to lessen our dependence away from oil based fuels, most would all agree with it. We do know want the extra tax to be part of general revenue to be wasted by Trudeau give-aways!
2597 2018-03-14 18:11:36 I got that 2 liter of oil in my kitchen cause I'm not wasting shit
2598 2018-03-14 18:11:35 Uganda is currently transitioning from oil exploration stage to development and production. The exploration stage took up 3 billion dollars with about 30 percent being retained in-country. #OilGasDialogue
2599 2018-03-14 18:11:26 yet insist on increased oil tanker traffic isn't that a conflicting position?

2608 2018-03-14 18:10:52 And nobody can even answer the most basic question: Why Tillerson as SoS in the first place? He and Trump didn't even know each other, let alone get along. A former oil CEO that just coincidentally had a half-trillion dollar deal in the works with Russia? Don't be naive Glenn.
2609 2018-03-14 18:10:52 @FirestoneTires your Oxford, AL is in need of major help, over 3 hours for a rotation and balance, which ended up as a balance only, and oil change. Sat for over an hour on the rack without a single person touching it. Will not be back. #neverwillreturn #badcustomerservice

2615 2018-03-14 18:09:41 Oil?!!
2616 2018-03-14 18:09:36 it clogs your pores, it doesn’t wash off easily, so even if you think you have it all off, there’s usually a residue that’s gonna trap all yr natural oils and cause breakouts. oil of any sort is actually pretty drying for most people’s skin. so dry skin ppl should stray away-

2621 2018-03-14 18:08:49 OK. From c1700 to c1950 the UK got rich 'cos it could force the colonies to buy manufactures, giving UK firms a guaranteed market with no need to produce quality. As the empire peeled off cash came from controlling middle East oil through Anglo-Iranian, but...

You could try it, afaik aloe doesn't make it greesy bc of some specific enzymes or sth
2626 2018-03-14 18:07:56 You mean the fuel to terrorism? Oil is traded worldwide only through the USD, (why america is powerful), also the USD to buy guns for the middle east decades ago, beginning terrorism

2641 2018-03-14 18:06:30 perfecto, thanks!  so 12% of the fat was Soybean Oil.  I'd think that would be a confounder in the analysis
2642 2018-03-14 18:06:28 Me: I want to be less greasy :((
Also me: Wow look at this facial oil it's supposed to be r moisturizing wow
2643 2018-03-14 18:06:19 Or stop by the SD oil leak and see first hand the impact of oil pipelines

2644 2018-03-14 18:06:14 I would share with my mam @claireoneill59 your brand is her favorite brand of coconut oil  we always buy it
2645 2018-03-14 18:06:11 Are you aware of how amazing fennel gets when baked in olive oil? It's sinful ;)
2646 2018-03-14 18:06:09 I know about the pipelines & the oil flow. It's getting ridiculous. I've cut back on my driving as far as I can go, & if I can find an electric golf cart I can afford to go to the store in, won't drive the gas guzzling van anymore than I have to to keep the engine from clogging
2647 2018-03-14 18:05:56 Get a room you two. 
2648 2018-03-14 18:05:53 As per usual, the author exhibits a bias, and a lack of understanding of the environmental concerns.  Alberta will not be affected by an oil spill on the west coast.  Given small spill response, BC does not believe that Canada is able to deal with a large oil spill.
2649 2018-03-14 18:05:49 Let’s use Saudi oil !
2650 2018-03-14 18:05:42 West will do actions only on symbolic level eg. boycott world cup, expell diplomats but they don't want do any actions in strategic level that can cost both west and russia like arm seriously ukraine or stop buying russian gas or crude oil
2651 2018-03-14 18:05:35 I know for a fact @ConstanceForOH refuses all money from corporations, big oil, big Rx, health insurance co’s, etc
2652 2018-03-14 18:05:34 “Your oil she’s milk ain’t no point in tryna mix”
2653 2018-03-14 18:05:31 Still are. And mct oil to make your brain work better.

2655 2018-03-14 18:05:14 Lmaoooooo I plead guilty. I will cooperate.
2656 2018-03-14 18:05:11 You mean our banks, drug companies, and oil companies right? Highest corporate profits ever at the expense of the consumers and you want Amazon to pay higher postage. Like Louis XVl you’re out of touch
2657 2018-03-14 18:04:49 I came in here strictly for an oil change. I don’t care if I need new tires. I’ll risk slipping and sliding across the highway, I know how to handle my car.

2661 2018-03-14 18:04:28 Just got an oil change bouta hit the car wash
2662 2018-03-14 18:04:22 My coworker really just put hot pepper oil in his eye to go home early  desperate mf
2663 2018-03-14 18:04:20 Who isn't biased?

It's your enemies that will come for you, always. Deal with it.
2664 2018-03-14 18:03:58 When I see you I’m slapping oil out yo hair
2665 2018-03-14 18:03:55 Every time I come get a oil change it’s some silly shit happening.
2666 2018-03-14 18:03:52 @TerryGlavin tillerson firing isnt about theresa may. that was a parting shot. the actual issue was exxon mobil pulling out of an oil deal; the reason tillerson was there in the first place. days after exxon pulls out, tillerson is fired. in retaliation he fires a shot at russia
2667 2018-03-14 18:03:47 HERE'S THE THING... I like a squeaky door - reminds me how lazy I am to get some oil and fix it GODDAMNIT!! #blackhat #squeaky #oil #lazy
2668 2018-03-14 18:03:37 Is oil wet?
2669 2018-03-14 18:03:37 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
2670 2018-03-14 18:03:36 Ahhaahaha their cane is soaking in crude oil in hell.
2671 2018-03-14 18:03:34 I am out of coconut oil. Why does life treat me this way.
2672 2018-03-14 18:03:27 You don't produce enough oil for your own needs, that's why you trade with other countries doorknob!
2673 2018-03-14 18:03:07 the honey and egg defo works!! add some kind of oil too (olive oil is great) and I swear it does wonders
2674 2018-03-14 18:03:02 Our current output of oil has put us in a unique position.  We should start the switch to renewables now, while we have relative energy independence.  That oil will run out some day, and it's bad for the environment.
2675 2018-03-14 18:02:52 Now playing: Incubus - Oil And Water
2676 2018-03-14 18:02:51 reported.
there is only one Heid.
2677 2018-03-14 18:02:35 I read that coconut oil isn't really helping at all but I thought abt trying out aloe vera im just scared it'll make my skin oily again
2678 2018-03-14 18:02:25 I'd like to report yet another case of tapping (this is getting of hand now). This time @NeoMolefe_SA has tapped Son. 
I'll leave it to the other managers to confirm this allegation.
2679 2018-03-14 18:02:08 have you ever used cleansing oil?
2680 2018-03-14 18:02:08 Made all my kids learn the basics, change a tire, check fluids, change oil, etc.. Now they thank me for those little bits of basic knowledge
2681 2018-03-14 18:02:03 Hour 4 and a half at the car dealership. Maybe my memories of a Saturday spent getting the oil changed wasn’t too far from the truth! #bored #spendingtoomuch
2682 2018-03-14 18:02:01 What is this new oil?
2683 2018-03-14 18:02:01 That olive oil idea is great!
2684 2018-03-14 18:02:00 Yep, they're free to coal companies, oil companies, uranium companies... thanks to you. But be sure to bilk the US taxpayers... Teddy Roosevelt would be screaming in your ear right now... shameful.

2688 2018-03-14 18:01:28 just the coconut oil ma
2689 2018-03-14 18:01:28 i don’t wear face make up but my skin is a little dull so i’ve been putting tree tea oil & green tea on my face n my skin is startin to glooooo 
2690 2018-03-14 18:01:26 The one where I did mine, a relatively small oil and gas servicing company. Company bilis ni, usually tidak cukup field and project engineer. So, interns pun akan buat literally kerja engineers  If one makes shitload of dough, it's a real one  so does the loss 
2691 2018-03-14 18:01:24 I use a Moroccan oil to smooth the frizzies 
2692 2018-03-14 18:01:22 The Nigerian system is basically an old engine running with new oil
2693 2018-03-14 18:01:21 Castor oil is literally amazing
2694 2018-03-14 18:01:20 Note to self: don’t try an oil pen for the first time while waiting tables.
2695 2018-03-14 18:01:19 Have you tried coconut oil or aloe vera
2696 2018-03-14 18:01:17 Someone plz come teach me how to change my oil because it’s needed and the way this car is sounding is wild
2697 2018-03-14 18:01:15 顔が可愛い人には可愛いって言わないと失礼でしょ。
2698 2018-03-14 18:01:13 I heard that Russia's state oil company is no longer looking to partner with Exxon for their gas/oil development and this is the reason Tillerson is no longer needed. Maybe that is the reason he sided so strongly with May. Maybe his siding with May is why Trump fired him.
2699 2018-03-14 18:01:10 Why did you not post anything about your “US oil domination” segment where your pro fracking LNG guest was able to preach his ‘clean’ energy stump speech completely unchallenged? Many scientists dont believe LNG is any better than coal. When you include methane output it’s worse.
2700 2018-03-14 18:01:09 What about Alberta ? Are you coming to sit down with oil industry workers??
2701 2018-03-14 18:01:04 "Oil in your own machine" the proverb is applicable to all. UP CM Yugi and his deputy lost in their soil today.

2708 2018-03-14 18:00:10 Answer this for me since Poland has been divided and invaded by it's neighbors over the centuries how would you suggest we deal with Vlad more rhetoric or concrete actions that number one reduce his income from oil and gas

2710 2018-03-14 18:00:03 No, too much of our national park land is being used for oil drilling. See the difference?
2711 2018-03-14 17:59:53 doing well too, lots in process with the weed oil dbs oil, in 2 weeks I gotta return for for a day from 9 till 9 for test runs, blood tapping, questions, etc massive investigation how my body responses now before we get the oile so they got a good picture of the prices
2712 2018-03-14 17:59:50 Yes, the GOP Traitors taking Russian money are ‘real’ Americans. And the snake oil salesman, Trump, is in love with Russia, he shared our top secret Intel with our Enemy. Real American. #RIPGOP #NoneIsAboveTheLaw

2716 2018-03-14 17:59:35 made pasta with olive oil and parmesan cheese because we have nothing else in this house to eat
2717 2018-03-14 17:59:20 Drink Castor oil
2718 2018-03-14 17:59:15 cabbage and tofu. Seriously, fried cabbage slowly with just a bit of fresh ginger for about 30mins. Add tofu. Serve on rice with a bit of soy sauce. If you feel fancy, some sesame oil. It's soooo good. Actually, I'm going to make it for myself.
2719 2018-03-14 17:59:12 The oil leak on my jeep has gotten bad enough that I basically don’t even have to change the oil anymore 
2720 2018-03-14 17:59:00 I love days when I get to use the machine shop and make experiment parts on the lathe and milling machine! Even if I am covered in plastic shavings and machine oil by the time I'm done 
2721 2018-03-14 17:58:59 Found out Lucas Oil Stadium is closed to set up for AMA supercross setup this week so change of plans for Fri: Go to Terre Haut to get Brantley Gilber ticket @ Hulman Center, and go to Memorial Stadium, whose days may be numbered...

2745 2018-03-14 17:55:50 Exxon canceled the oil deal since the sanctions weren't going to be lifted so there was no point for Tillerson to remain there.  Now the Kochs will get their own Secretary of State puppet if Pompeo is approved.

2748 2018-03-14 17:55:42 @fia @F1 concerned your commitment to enviro stewardship comes up short by turning a blind eye to the obvious pollution the 18 Ferrari F1 car emits burning oil through a open crankcase vent (legal in EU?).

Hello - I'm very much enjoying the debate, but that door that squeaks - it's just so loud on the parliament tv feed.

I did tweet to the @UKHouseofLords but ignored... wee bit of oil mate!

It's the one behind and to the right of Lord Hope.

Many thanks
2764 2018-03-14 17:53:40 It stays with US the citizens of the province of Ontario - not to corporate cronies - and a Rainy Day Fund to rival Norway's trillion dollar oil fund is the FIRST THING that needs to be established...and all those jobs should be UNION.
2765 2018-03-14 17:53:38 I use organic coconut oil and it works so good. Suppose to help your eyelashes grow too 
2766 2018-03-14 17:53:38 It really is. I baked the fennel with the chicken and lemon and added olive oil and honey. Delicious.
2767 2018-03-14 17:53:33 #palmoil combined with unchecked hyper-capitalism/neoliberalism. Maybe it (the palm oil) could even have been a good thing under a more benign system. People, in close colaboration with our governments, are the driving force destroying the rainforests.
2768 2018-03-14 17:53:24 Shell Oil is hosting a forum on renewable energy at SXSW, where a tatooed millenial is interviewing the CEO.

That statement alone should tell you why SXSW is pure garbage.
2769 2018-03-14 17:53:16 Fella this is no where near the same scenario. This man wasn't married to her, wasn't deployed, wasn't working on an oil rig, he was just purposely ignoring her texts. smh.

2) Coated in baking powder/seasoning and left in fridge overnight. 
3) tossed in a plastic grocery bag full of regular flour and cornmeal. 
4) olive oil & placed in a hot state-of-the-art convection oven 400degs until crispy AF

2782 2018-03-14 17:51:50 I hate coming to get my oil changed bc I feel like I get finessed bc I'm clueless af when it comes to car tings :/

2784 2018-03-14 17:51:09 like coconut oil based things
2785 2018-03-14 17:50:43 When I had my surgery, my MD recommended I take either fish oil or flax seed oil because of the vitamin E. He said they're inexpensive and easily available and good for eye health so I trust him on that!

2788 2018-03-14 17:50:21 This was me in Walmart the other day. It was 4 hours to get my oil changed.
2789 2018-03-14 17:50:14 This will be the same 'intelligence' services that said Iraq had the capability to mobilise WMDs in days to attack Britain before we invaded their country to steal their oil. Those intelligence services?

2792 2018-03-14 17:50:08 In his final news conference of the year, President Barack Obama said Russia's economy "doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy," except oil, gas and arms. The only way Russia can affect the U.S., he said, is "if we lose track of who we are" and "abandon our values."
2793 2018-03-14 17:50:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2794 2018-03-14 17:49:54 palm oil...IN A DRINK @marksandspencer ?? definitely did not expect that. it may be sustainable but so, so unnecessary #disappointing #floridaorange
2795 2018-03-14 17:49:39 I hate that. Open the front door and the back door to create a vacuum effect then spray a lavender essential oil to sooth the remain odors and offer coffee to everyone still there

2799 2018-03-14 17:48:57 Shows just how much worse than Thatcher, Blair & Cameron moronic May is: this isnt Iraq, Afghanistan or any other country the UK can pick a fight with for oil & regime change - this is Russia FFS. As usual in trying to do something to show she...
2800 2018-03-14 17:48:34 US and EU should develop an energy policy that makes Russian oil irrelevant.
2801 2018-03-14 17:48:31 Pizza Buona called. They are looking for their chilli oil :(
2802 2018-03-14 17:48:28 Oh gosh, it’s sounds like you’ve been through some stuff too. I really hope you find a way to get some relief. What’s Lemon Oil, is it something you can pick up somewhere like Holland & Barrett?
2803 2018-03-14 17:48:26 ugh getting an oil change is so annoying like why isn't this shit free
2804 2018-03-14 17:48:22 Tea tree oil stank! Don’t argue with me
2805 2018-03-14 17:48:14 In my opinion, the PC's handled our money like a roughneck getting off his two week shift and spent it all like the work and high oil prices would always be there. No planning ahead, whatsoever.
2806 2018-03-14 17:48:10 IF Oil goes over 3.00 dollars a gallon Nationally, That is when your supporters will leave you... Dont let that happen because that will kill the Economy
2807 2018-03-14 17:47:55 นี่ไม่เคยคิดจะไปโซนที่เมนอยู่เลยนะ แต่จะไปโซนที่จะซึมซับกับ เมมเบอร์ทุกคน มองภาพเป็นแนวตรง เราเลยอยู่แต่หลุมกลางตลอด BC/ BR/ BR /AC

2810 2018-03-14 17:47:40 If it helps, Trump won  by a large margin in Pa in the last election. This looks like far fewer people are following his attitudes,beliefs, snake oil con man spiel. People may be watching his actions more than his words. It's a start.  #Blessings to you.
2811 2018-03-14 17:47:24 Republican voters are either idiots or don't give a shit about anyone else than them (and usually both).

Remember trying to tell Republicans that the Iraq war was folly, that it would last for long time and cost a shit ton, and they responded that we were getting oil & "90days"
2812 2018-03-14 17:47:17 Oil ocean coming VERY SOON!!!!!
2813 2018-03-14 17:46:59 Sen Tim Lanane on CBD oil.  "The previous version allowed for the sale of CBD oil with a lot of labeling but it still made it illegal to manufacture the CBD oil.  I think this latest reiteration allows for manufacturing but I still need to look at the details of that."
2814 2018-03-14 17:46:58 Come on in For Waxy Wednesday and get 20% off of any regular priced oil!
2815 2018-03-14 17:46:53 @ABeconomist - 5 things to watch:
1. Pipelines (it's not even abt economics now)
2. Household debt levels 
3. International trade
4. Energy and oil prices (dog that wags lots of tails)
5. Labour Market - AI, robotics etc

2821 2018-03-14 17:46:15 .@BCLiberals push a pipeline regardless of the rise of clean renewable energy b/c dirty oil corps have bribed them to lie. Once the pipeline is built, if global demand drops off, they'll reverse the argument. New message will be "gotta keep using oil because of pipeline" #bcpoli

2823 2018-03-14 17:46:03 Of course they do. If the PC's had done their jobs correctly, there'd be money in the Heritage Fund that would have helped get Alberta thru the last three years of low oil prices. As it stands, the PC's left us with nothing.
2824 2018-03-14 17:46:00 My car literally destroys my bank account with gas I had 50 miles when I left the house and almost just ran out of gas not even 15 miles away and I literally had an oil change not even a month ago
2825 2018-03-14 17:45:56 anyway hopefully it'll be fun trying to oil paint his tattoos
2826 2018-03-14 17:45:47 Bitch love they foreign cars until that oil change come around 
2827 2018-03-14 17:45:47 Yeah, Seattle doesn't get enough respect but that's because it's a coolbed of technology, not a hotbed like Silicon Valley! Washingtonians move at a more relaxed pace and 'play the long game' as opposed the 'burn the midnight oil' SV way.
2828 2018-03-14 17:45:46 if the surfaces are rotating around each other use oil, such as 3-in-1 or plain ol motor oil 

if they slide against each other, use grease. Simple white lithium grease is $4 for a can that will last your entire life.

2832 2018-03-14 17:45:25 @Great_blogging Am a Materials & Production Engineer,currently working in an Oil & Gas servicing company as a TESTING ENGINEER but looking to explore new career opportunities. Kindly RT my next employer might be on your TL
2833 2018-03-14 17:45:23 Because USA needs oil. Why the Oil Companies could not manufacture bio oil, and make profit on this ? Grown on the country side diesol for the motocycles.
2834 2018-03-14 17:45:19 Cleo has always loved coconut oil. Every time the jars opened she runs over to lick it. I looked it up and it’s actually good for her so I put a lil in her bowl today and she started meowing askin for more. We’re getting healthy together 
2835 2018-03-14 17:45:16 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2836 2018-03-14 17:45:07 You read our oil has controls up and down while Saudi has none! Why does mr t and his party not see the $ loss? Do they all kneel there with there heads in the sand looking for that magic formula to replace the Carbon tax? NO!! A Canada Goose again!!
2837 2018-03-14 17:45:06 Skin Tip:
Get Rid of Perfumed Lotion
Stop using lotion that’s full of alcohol. Lotion is an ointment, and you don’t want your skin soaking up a bunch of chemicals that will dehydrate it. Try raw shea butter, coconut oil, argan oil, vitamin e, cocoa butter, or grapeseed oil.

2843 2018-03-14 17:44:28 Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
2844 2018-03-14 17:44:26 Maybe but I don't think so. Remember China has more to lose.
They are dependant on our trade. They sell us way more than we sell them. And its not oil they sell us. They are dependant on exports. US 70% domestic.h We hold the big stick --for now...and need to use it while we can
2845 2018-03-14 17:44:24 It was great to work with such a professional team!  We’ll be back to build more soon. You guys burned the midnight oil to have us ready for the PGA show.  Thank you!!

2847 2018-03-14 17:44:08 2/2 so I have like 10% the idea of the pain your currently in :( I have found Lemon Oil (just breathing it when I need it) is really helping me to keep positive through the pain. Sending you lots of good thoughts & hope that now it will improve xxx
2848 2018-03-14 17:44:05 maracuja oil is a major key 
2849 2018-03-14 17:43:58 Yeah... nothing to see here... couldn’t imagine why it’s referred to as the liberal media?!?
2850 2018-03-14 17:43:49 beyonce isn't going to deal with potentially spilling whatever sparkling beverage she's drinking from the back seat just to perform at Lucas Oil. Also, from a financial standpoint there are just bigger cities with bigger venues and more ppl willing to travel to them

2856 2018-03-14 17:43:07 Yeah, IMHO he behaves like the big oil & steel titans of the last century. We need to move forward with technology not backward with coal
2857 2018-03-14 17:43:06 I have sensitive skin/oil skin and it broke me out so I don’t recommend it.

2860 2018-03-14 17:42:49 Would you rather have Oil consumption or A system and method for detecting changes in tire status in real time, e?
2861 2018-03-14 17:42:45 Twitter is running on oil money.
2862 2018-03-14 17:42:40 Not bad if you can get it. Stricken commodity trader Noble Group paid a group of top traders $20m last year as it worked on a deal to sell its US oil business to Vitol.
2863 2018-03-14 17:42:35 We can't afford not to strive towards the use of clean energy in order to save our planet. Coal, oil, etc. are all LIMITED resources that will eventually run out if we continue to accelerate the amount of them we use.
2864 2018-03-14 17:42:25 Painting class has at least changed my life 'cause I never would've even tried to do oil paints if I wasn't REQUIRED to because of the cost.

IT GIVES ME HAPPY FEELINGS
2865 2018-03-14 17:42:08 My name is Ashley and I getting my oil changed gives me unreal levels of anxiety
2866 2018-03-14 17:42:07 Perhaps Brain because (a) they pay a lot more in tax than we do.  (b) They don't have FREE at point of entry NHS treatment - you have to pay to see a GP in most countries, including your beloved Norway.  (c)  The oil companies are all privately owned.

2868 2018-03-14 17:41:37 @narendramodi 
Sir, 
I have been a big fan of yours and a hard core BJP supporter.
It's my request to bring oil prices under GST at the earliest.
it shall surely bring dividends in the upcoming elections next year.
I wish to see you as our PM once again Sir.
Thank you.

2872 2018-03-14 17:41:12 Helps with growth? I use olive oil now but I don’t think it helps it grow just maintains it
2873 2018-03-14 17:41:11 How about enforce the laws we already have or get fired and replaced.
2874 2018-03-14 17:41:01 Its a Midnight Oil kind of day today
2875 2018-03-14 17:41:00 Kanang gahilak ko tas kalimot ko nga naa diay castor oil sakong pilok, undang gud ug tulo akong luha. Kasayang sa kwarta ug ihilak ra. Hahaha
2876 2018-03-14 17:40:45 Like, if I get black liquid liner in my eye it will definitely smart a little and make my eyes water a lot (but fortunately not burn or go red)
But using something like a white eyeliner pencil doesn’t because those tend to mostly be oil based I think (it really does depend)

2884 2018-03-14 17:40:05 Rosemary oil or extra virgin olive oil
2885 2018-03-14 17:40:04 You’re absolutely right. I feel that the term “terrorist” was coined specifically for Muslims tho so the gov’t had the support of the citizens to invade the Middle East merely for oil and poppy fields. This country shits on everything it apparently represents.
2886 2018-03-14 17:39:59 So anti-NRA and stricter gun laws are the only new idea.

2888 2018-03-14 17:39:40 Frankincense essential oil is a powerful astringent, meaning it helps protect skin cells. It can be used to help reduce acne blemishes, the appearance of large pores, prevent wrinkles, and it even helps lift and tighten skin to naturally slow signs of aging. #skincare

2890 2018-03-14 17:39:20 So I have a cousin staying with me. Today, he said he wanted to learn how to cook fish (hake- baby steps). Okay, give him simple instructions: spice the fish, heat a little oil and butter, then fry. Easy, right?
2891 2018-03-14 17:39:03 you ever roast thick slices of cabbage in the oven for 30 minutes with olive oil and then generously salt them???????????

it's delicious and will cost you approximately $1 to make a good side dish

2900 2018-03-14 17:38:14 Just got on the bus and frantically prepared myself a life preserving Olbas Oil tissue. 

It was like a shit outtake from @IrvineWelsh’s #Trainspotting

2904 2018-03-14 17:37:32 If olive oil is made out of olives then what is baby oil made of? Illuminati confirmed. Jk. But seriously tho what’s it made of
2905 2018-03-14 17:37:17 How about upstream emissions of the users of oil, say car makers or aeroplane makers like @Bombardier ?

2913 2018-03-14 17:36:38 I'm creating a command economy. My 5 year plan will allow our country to produce more steel, coil and oil. Our country will become westernized and we can trade and compete with all the other countries in the world. #SeeMeIn5

2931 2018-03-14 17:34:34 Venezuelan oil production keeps falling, now below 1.600 thousand barrels per day. Fun fact: the current oil minister said he would raise production by 500 thousand back in january.

OR WITH 100%?,,what do you think?,,no barnet,,no handouts,,just 100%
Answer please better off or worse off with 100%
2934 2018-03-14 17:34:08 Lavender Essential Oil is amazing! I put in my diffuser every night & it puts me right to sleep. I also blend it with Grapeseed Oil to moisturize my body & face when it’s super dry!

2942 2018-03-14 17:32:28 This is some of the biggest news in dirt racing history! Incredible. Hopefully the first of many races to be aired on live tv.
2943 2018-03-14 17:32:11 Me too, but mix it with ginger oil. A hairdresser told me to do that. Put it in your hair like the night before you’re gonna wash it, make sure you especially get it in the roots and massage it in, do it upside down also so blood rushes to your head it stimulates growth

Also, you can treat the area with mineral oil. After a few moments, wipe away the oil using a clean cloth, and if the residue is still
2948 2018-03-14 17:31:35 Unbelievable. That you'd call it a slur is out of this world. Globalist is opposite to hyper local.  It's a political philosophy, some nationalistic perspectives have merit.  Like...refining Canada's oil for domestic purposes vs selling it to Exxon Mobil (gloablism).

2951 2018-03-14 17:31:01 When laying blame another big factor is the anti-pipeline movement.  There’s very little oil that actually needs to be hauled by rail.  All sorts of capacity would become available if pipelines were simply allowed to be built.
2952 2018-03-14 17:31:01 I understand that palm oil production is driving these apes into extinction in their native habitat. I have found it very difficult to avoid products containing palm oil. Any hints would be welcome

2960 2018-03-14 17:29:56 V interesting idea -certainly agree that benefit sharing, public value and equity are critical. Value of data is in its collective, not individual, power, so democratising could ensure collective benefits for society, but not sure oil analogy holds fully for sensitive health data

About 1liter water(fill in spray bottle)
add pep.oil(~8/10drops)shake well,spray it everywhere,mostly kitchen,bathroom,entrance door place,apply this almost every day!

because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
2974 2018-03-14 17:28:17 Yeah mostly. Sometimes I cut them into slices or spiral cut them and eat them baked like fried, or cook them in a pan, but no oil.
2975 2018-03-14 17:28:09 The same can also be said about the @GOP as they tend to be pundits of big oil and hardly do anything to improve our infrastructure. I hope that Lamb keeps true to what he said because as the far right and far left continue with this dangerous game, the middle is slowly torn.

3002 2018-03-14 17:25:05 Taking the msm as a supplement has been great. So I know adding it to the oil has to do something.
3003 2018-03-14 17:25:04 without Europe's oil purchases... Russia goes broke in months and loses Crimea in the process. The Middle East & Iran will be happy to fill the need.

3005 2018-03-14 17:24:50 Hi Michael, I believe our Homecare Team don't cover oil based boilers. The best bet would be to speak to the team to make sure & they can be contacted on 0800 365 100. It's option 1 & if asked for the reference number press the star key to bypass this. Thanks, Waz

This is why the approach would have to be from a marketing perspective.
3014 2018-03-14 17:23:46 OK would have money if they hadn’t cut the oil/gas production taxes during the recent boom years.
3015 2018-03-14 17:23:41 @Patriots are extremely cheap. But they wanna shine every year at the big game. That era is over, Brady can gone and hang it up. Once you debockle a well oil machine it’s history.
3016 2018-03-14 17:23:40 Yawn. Poor implies lack of income-that isn’t the issue. Scotland needs to spend much more per head than rUK on services due to geography and demography. At current oil price that’s only feasible with pooling/sharing. Not too poor-just expensive!
3017 2018-03-14 17:23:39 I've been sitting here for over an hour waiting for my oil to be changed

3019 2018-03-14 17:23:05 Aye. I think it was Jack Monroe that put me on the the veg oil/rapeseed oil thing. Saves lots of £££ on fancy rapeseed oil.

3028 2018-03-14 17:22:25 Oil Prices was slightly higher after strong Chinese factory activity, though concern over the pace of growth in U.S. output, as well as other producing nations, limited gains.
3029 2018-03-14 17:22:22 she obv knew how to oil the machine, but I do think theranos was set apart b/c of the crazy valuation even by valley standards and would have been subject to serious inspection far earlier had it not been for the fawning coverage of holmes

3069 2018-03-14 17:17:12 Some people might beleive that there are rich Liberals down east who don't want Alberta oil cutting into there business..  Is that possible ? If so they don't stand for Canada,do they.

Fiat= Whale oil and Crypto= Electricity
3076 2018-03-14 17:16:01 So how does Trudeau pushing for pipelines in Canada help foreign oil?  Confused?

3078 2018-03-14 17:15:33 So. just decided that I’ll be making a herbal hair oil with msm in it. I’m adding dried bamboo leaves, fenugreek powder, obviously the msm, jbco, Argan oil, and wheat germ oil. I might add tea tree oil or peppermint but not both.
3079 2018-03-14 17:15:32 I'm almost embarrassed to say, it's the bowl the local dollar store sells for changing your oil. It's lasted 8 years so far and is still going strong. I have the camera about 3 feet from it. Out back, I have a regular bird bath with a camera looking at it.
3080 2018-03-14 17:15:32 So I agree with her 100% and especially with the coconut  oil 
3081 2018-03-14 17:15:31 Oil change. Then Burger King. Then band practice and drinking Pabst
3082 2018-03-14 17:15:31 Too much meat, dairy, salt and oil are just as bad or even worse than sugar! The world health organization(WHO) has meat especially processed as a carcinogen. Which causes cancer.
3083 2018-03-14 17:15:29 I went to get my oil changed this man said it'd be an hour and a half to two hours.... it took 45 mins

3093 2018-03-14 17:14:16 You are told "Mexico will pay for the wall," now it's "the wall will keep out drug dealers." How big a sucker moron are you to believe anything DRAFT DODGING DONNIE tells you. Drug dealers will always find a way and they laugh at the stupid wall. You are buying bs snake oil.
3094 2018-03-14 17:14:04 Climate science clearly shows that the world cannot afford to burn even known oil reserves, let alone find new ones. Exploration must end. A rapid phase out of fossil fuel reliance has to happen.

3119 2018-03-14 17:11:35 I find it a bit hypocritical for @Schwarzenegger to attack big oil & compare it to tobacco. As Governor he often commuted to work in a private jet and he had a tent setup to smoke cigars at the Gov mansion.
3120 2018-03-14 17:11:12 Dipping the world's worst bread in some of the world's most extraordinary olive oil is just so disappointing.

3137 2018-03-14 17:09:47 @pixieeelocks Hey Pixie, you said you are trying out skin care stuff and I wanted to suggest a fun/gross mask: Clay powder+Charcoal+water= paste on face for 20min. 
You can actually see the oil being pulled out of your pores, it's too fun, if you're into that sort of thing
3138 2018-03-14 17:09:36 What about US corn and oil subsidies etc  
3139 2018-03-14 17:09:23 Remember a TV advert in the 80s for motor oil or something that had a similar character in the trees. Anyone remember that?

3143 2018-03-14 17:09:03 @krispykreme Why, after nearly 3 years' notice by the @US_FDA to stop use of "unsafe for human consumption" partially hydrogenated oil, is your product not yet compliant with the upcoming ban?
3144 2018-03-14 17:09:03 If you look at the ingredients panel on a lot of (not all) supermarket vegetable oil, it's actually rapeseed oil.
3145 2018-03-14 17:08:52 Well, in 2017 Oil prices have been substantially higher (by 60%) than previous in 2016. If we follow your logic the share would have had to increase by 60%....
So, your logic is ill-founded and you will be better to look at real figures

3147 2018-03-14 17:08:34 Order it online from them, they're pretty good. £6.50, I think, for one hand balm in a tin, and about the same for two refills. I've just been working with Sugru, so have been washing my hands a lot; so I've applied a fingerful of the Body Shop almond oil hand butter.

3152 2018-03-14 17:08:16 You would think if oil companies wanted to get their oil across BC they would treat BC fair at the pumps. Proof oil companies, .@RachelNotley and .@JustinTrudeau are arrogant and self centered.
3153 2018-03-14 17:08:11 Aye my Kenyan artists we need to do better. The fact that Safaricom a Kenyan company is willing to fly in Diamond and exclusively have his album on Songa app speaks volumes to the gap of content we have here.  Vanessa mdee is coming also.

3174 2018-03-14 17:04:58 If those responsible for the Iraq war lies had been prosecuted, found guilty and jailed, Iraq and then Libya and now Syria wd not have been destroyed in ongoing theft of oil and land and oil/gas pipes. And they cdn’t promote war on Russia now to get both Syria and Iran.

Once I have this all done and am back suited and booted, an iphone is a possibility. I think I should go back to my old Nokia 3310 (still got one
3183 2018-03-14 17:04:07 Please do it! It would crush the current lob-bot-omized social lefty Standard Oil of thought control.
3184 2018-03-14 17:04:04 I c. That’s not super dry. I know the plant I deal with hates really dry -6% canola hard to crush as is canola over 10% hard to crush.

3206 2018-03-14 17:01:39 No.  The Steelers are selling snake oil.  They need an ILB, and Colbert isn't thrilled with the ILB draft prospects.  #cappedout #overpaidBell
3207 2018-03-14 17:01:30 Any gun at all which is not true. We have all been walked over or on my Politicians because they accept campaign money from Corporations  like the Oil Industries & yes the NRA & it influences their votes, which makes our voices literally unheard.
3208 2018-03-14 17:01:25 Oil change freakin $100. Love my car but she just as expensive as me. Boujee la bitch.
3209 2018-03-14 17:01:22 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
3210 2018-03-14 17:01:09 Definitely a big difference in price...More oil and it’s like they double the labor 
3211 2018-03-14 17:01:03 He's been on the way out for months now.  Time for him to go back to his Big Oil job!
3212 2018-03-14 17:00:46 Let's be reasonable. The world still needs oil. So I find it curious that protesters are only targeting Canadian tankers. Are protesters being funded by foreign interests? If so, they need to be treated as enemies of the state.

3219 2018-03-14 17:00:17 Mr.scheer give quebecers a reasons to vote for you. Cut taxes, especially carbon tax, we pay more for gas than any other province. Offer them honesty  and transparency. Stop importing oil. Give families more incentives to stay home and raise their children.

3223 2018-03-14 16:59:33 Yeah why would those networks want to appeal to a younger audience.
3224 2018-03-14 16:59:31 I spent 10 minutes looking for my car’s oil dipstick only to find out that bmw literally just left it out of this model entirely lmao

3229 2018-03-14 16:59:19 Well, we know it was never really about that. Bush Jnr was unpopular and some felt illegitimate as president. It bolstered his position in office, furthered neoliberal / oil+gas-grabbing agenda, and kept neoliberal mil/industrial complex ticking over after bipolarity ended.
3230 2018-03-14 16:59:11 At Honda getting an oil change

3248 2018-03-14 16:56:54 Hi Jordan. The wording on the bottle was changed recently from 'part-synthetic' to 'synthetic technology', but this oil is still part-synthetic not fully synthetic.
3249 2018-03-14 16:56:53 Nope, unlikely that they ever will since it seems to boil down to lots of spilled blood for oil and profits, and control of oil and profits.

3260 2018-03-14 16:55:19 The CWB suppressed production by focusing on low yield wheats and delaying payment. More oil, ore, coal, and potash is moving today. It's hard to compare then to now.

3270 2018-03-14 16:54:33 It has everything to do with govt corruption and greed in powerful corporations. Hemp challenged both the paper and oil industry, DuPont invented nylon in the late 20s early 30s and wanted to take over ship building industry which was dominated by hemp rope and cotton sails.

3291 2018-03-14 16:51:33 I made pot-infused vegetable oil to make brownies and I used the leftover oil to make popcorn and this was the best decision I've made by far
3292 2018-03-14 16:51:23 I must ask, what price are we willing to pay for that oil and gas you believe we "need"?
3293 2018-03-14 16:51:17 Have you, have you ever *tried* drinking pure oil?  I had *very* oil rich meals for long-distance hikes (good weight to calorie ratio), and it's not that pleasant... ;)

3310 2018-03-14 16:49:01 i took mine off myself and my real eyelashes are fine. just rub baby oil on them and let it sit and play around with them and they’ll come off. it’ll take time tho. all you have to do is keep rubbing your lash line

3313 2018-03-14 16:48:48 So my truck starts shaking after about 10 minutes of driving but it only shakes when not moving. When in motion it doesn't shake. The oil was recently changed so that shouldn't be it. So I'm confused and worried.
3314 2018-03-14 16:48:22 On twitter people will tell you they've used cooking oil as lotion and vaseline to fry eggs. Smh.
3315 2018-03-14 16:48:17 Counter-take: History will look back on the cult of Trump as a group of desperate, angry idiots, capable of only communicating in “us vs them” terms, who ironically, were hurt the most by this snake oil salesman.
3316 2018-03-14 16:48:07 They have oil and gas we need, however.
3317 2018-03-14 16:47:55 Dude next to me at the oil change is looking around like it’s his first time. He’s like 45.

3348 2018-03-14 16:44:20 So, Pompeo is close to Trump & he's a hawk. Meaning he will be on a war-footing.  Remember how well Rumsfeld worked? Remember Iraq happened because the right hawks gave GW a reason to retaliate against for the attempt on his father's life. And oil.
3349 2018-03-14 16:44:19 Tillerson joined Trump's admin as a businessman with a $billion oil deal to do in Russia. Pres.Trump promised the end of sanctions on Russia and the castration of NATO making a "killing" for both. With DJT failing to deliver, no need for Tillerson.
3350 2018-03-14 16:44:08 // water is only wet with oil on it
3351 2018-03-14 16:44:02 You still got more than two weeks, burn that midnight oil! Lucky enough the weather has been decent for us to put some laps to shake down the new car. Didn’t want to go into the first race with no laps on it.
3352 2018-03-14 16:44:01 This rule will stop center line infractions just like the oil down rule kept everyone from blowing motors.
Riiiiiiight
3353 2018-03-14 16:43:51 Fantastic @PaulNicklen emphasizes importance of addressing climate change and threats of oil spills in opening keynote at #GLOBEForum
3354 2018-03-14 16:43:46 I once heard a comedian say, “How come the woman who remembers what socks I wore on our second date 5 yrs ago can’t tell me how long the car oil light has been blinking?”  But somehow he managed to convey a certain *mutual* befuddlement that was kind of charming.
3355 2018-03-14 16:43:34 There is a bigger picture at play. This is about spheres of interest being threatened. Syria, Iran, oil+gas, NATO expansion and public opinion. Also, reduces the scrutiny on Brexit and domestic policies. All major countries have their own self interests to maintain. Nationalistic
3356 2018-03-14 16:43:29 I’ve been putting Rose oil on my face every night and my skin is so soft and the bags under my eyes are gone.  I’m loving my skin

3360 2018-03-14 16:43:03 But then smoking cannabis doesn't cure cancer, it's the CBD oil that supposedly cures it, which is not illegal it's just no available on NHS
3361 2018-03-14 16:42:57 If the media reporting is making you angry. Use Social media to critique them. They are like the squeaky wheel, they respond to oil. #tcot
3362 2018-03-14 16:42:49 これ以上は…いけない！
3363 2018-03-14 16:42:43 @McDonalds your store inn International Drive, Orlando, Florida needs to salt their French Fries. I'm confident that salt would have helped to mask the fact that the oil needs to be changed in the dryer.
3364 2018-03-14 16:42:33 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.
3365 2018-03-14 16:42:29 My pup eats it frozen. Some times he gets coconut oil, egg, or a raw chicken foot in his breakfast.
3366 2018-03-14 16:42:28 US has ALWAYS failed EVERYWHERE.  But the  love for POWER and OIL  is more  than anything  for  sure.
3367 2018-03-14 16:42:24 Even worse, recently saw an article about a recent quiet deal for an oil company that only cost them a few hundred dollars. They were getting rights to OUR land for literally pennies.
3368 2018-03-14 16:42:09 If I get this engineering in oil I wanna move to NorCal then Colorado next

3370 2018-03-14 16:41:55 You are correct, but its all about the sentiment at the moment. Even minor support for the "oil is about to die" narrative is blown out of proportion.
3371 2018-03-14 16:41:54 Mr Texas oil billionaire lol too funny and I actually waited on Wall Street 14 years I'm the eighties black people has more opportunities than Hispanics which is not saying much jefe

3376 2018-03-14 16:41:29 You know you’re in #kidmin when you have all these random supplies in your office...VBS curriculum, egg cartons, sharpies, coconut oil, propane tanks, headbands, cheeses, cookies...I could go on
3377 2018-03-14 16:41:21 أنا محتاجه أشتري كاميرا فيلم قديمة، وألوان oil pastel وأنزل كل يوم أصور في الشارع وبعدها أقعد على البحر أرسم، وأكون بقالي فترة بقرأ كتاب معين وغرقانه فيه، وعندي لستة أفلام لازم أخلصها، ومتاهة ممتعة من الصور والكلمات والألوان، والموضوع مبهج بصراحة إنك تفكر فيه بس. الفن مَهرب جميل.
3378 2018-03-14 16:41:20 So I loveeee Mediterranean seasoning like at Zoës Kitchen or Tazikis. So i use Garlic, Pepper, Parsley, Dill, Thyme, Oregano, and salt. I mix all of that with some olive oil and brush it over my chicken while it’s grilling

But I'll miss genders most of all when the @DNC takes over. 
3381 2018-03-14 16:40:49 I wonder did Putin tell him to get rid of Tillerson since no oil deal and he couldn't remove sanctions. Ummm..

3386 2018-03-14 16:39:40 To all Gulf states enabling #Turkey's genocide in #Afrin. When @Trump is in jail you will pay for this. Your ruling families will pay. Including the Saudis.

3394 2018-03-14 16:38:57 Its not solar panels big oil's afraid of,

It's the pro-nuclear millennial who's mouth wont stay shut.

I have been changing my habits and it's been hard . Mostly compromises , it's a start .

3403 2018-03-14 16:38:20 OK
3404 2018-03-14 16:38:15 Possibly not, I’ve only done 1 oil on canvas exhibition in my life and that was 15 years ago lol
3405 2018-03-14 16:38:12 So it takes a chick with balls to do something that a man couldn’t! what is up with that? Gentlemen time to man up and get these fucking bullies out of office,  no matter what we have to do. That includes the lobbyist for  NRA, big pharmaceutical, oil&gas ect
3406 2018-03-14 16:37:09 OIL!!!!!
3407 2018-03-14 16:37:08 Did it occur to you idiots that the plan for the rally preceded the politicians? Stop looking for conspiracies. Tin foil is going to get expensive.
3408 2018-03-14 16:37:04 Replace "Girlfriend in a coma" with "Olive Oil Etcetera" in the lyrics. It's a bit of a reach.
3409 2018-03-14 16:36:58 That is anti business. Apparently the only business GOP care about us big oil and banks. The GOP is a Putin-Koch anti American party. It must be wiped out. @SenateGOP @SenFeinstein
3410 2018-03-14 16:36:54 No lift of sanctions.  No russia Exxon oil deal.  No need for Rex.  Good riddance.
3411 2018-03-14 16:36:52 Outrageous, but it IS being attended overwhelmingly by Democrats anyway. Might as well see it as one less day the "educators" have in the classroom to indoctrinate/subjugate the kids whose parents are doing their jobs correctly
3412 2018-03-14 16:36:52 I put three tablespoons of coconut oil in my hair. Let’s see what happens.
3413 2018-03-14 16:36:44 UAR a small chapter in arab nationalism history, a joke to use it as evidence that the west does not restrict arabic agency

US sustained oil producing monarchies for decades, crushing secular nationalist opposition throughout the ME and emboldening islamist extremists in SA
3414 2018-03-14 16:36:30 @BorisJohnson's hair has gone well off piste. May I suggest an anti frizz oil?
3415 2018-03-14 16:36:11 Aloe Vera with Organic Coconut oil will make your hair healthy.
3416 2018-03-14 16:36:10 Since we still have the oil we may as well try selling it as well. And if we can sell it at better prices to other countries the better.I may not like the Oil industry but till the world gets off it, it will be part of our Economy.

3418 2018-03-14 16:35:53 Reduction of Oil & Gas Production of KP due to import of LNG by Fed Govt has caused loss of:

1. Rs 5.64 Billion Foreign exchange
2. Rs 480 Million Royalty
3. Rs 25 Million Fed Excise Duty
4. Rs 100 Million Windfall Levy

Total Rs 6.9 Billion lost only in the month of DEC 2017

3422 2018-03-14 16:35:27 @HpoolCouncil could you make it easier to dispose of used cooking oil at burn road instead of having to ring first to get permission? I just find it a bit tedious to ring up everytime I have used cooking oil.
3423 2018-03-14 16:35:22 You misunderstood what I was saying! I hate Trump. Attempting to say "even China" sees they need solar power to survive... BUT Trump ass will never accept renewable energy due to the oil industry... and yes, with his tariffs it will destroy what has been a growing business.

3432 2018-03-14 16:34:28 Right? OMG you had a corporate job at a bank once, must be all about colonizing Iran for the oil and pulling a Stacey Dash. Despite your current job, this must somehow be true in bro country.

3441 2018-03-14 16:33:22 Great leap forward. Other Priority project for 2017/2018 inclued revival of national flag carrier -Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL), construction of the Hoima-Tanga crude oil pipeline and Lindi liquefied natural gas LNG plant.
3442 2018-03-14 16:33:20 Dear sir,  Though I am a hardcore BJP fan, unable to reconcile the way AP is being treated.  Hope BJP think tank will burn midnight oil on reassessing the support of allies and respecting the sentiments of the people.

3445 2018-03-14 16:33:13 Izzy just asked another table for their olive oil so she could take a picture 
3446 2018-03-14 16:32:56 Yes, the Saints built New Orleans. Because NOLA doesn't have Mardi Gras, oil refineries, Northrop Grumman, and Tulane University.

3449 2018-03-14 16:32:36 I visited a helicopter ditching training facility in the UK. Oil rig workers heading to N Sea have to practice. Extricating from harness & egressing while submerged, inverted & blind ain't easy. First time, you fail--which is why there's training.

3452 2018-03-14 16:32:21 Oil Spillerson
3453 2018-03-14 16:32:01 El costo del gas oil es prohibitivo donde luz no hay por falta de inversión. Pero hay muchos productores que en vez de invertir tranqueras adentro en vacas gordas, compraron departamentos, camionetas. Ahora se quejan por la sequia. La culpa no es del entorno.
3454 2018-03-14 16:31:57 You mean that one time everything went wrong? Yeah, Russians messed up sleeping gas dosage.
Assad allegations are there to delegitemise him and oppose having oil tunnels come through his country.
3455 2018-03-14 16:31:56 Almost feel sorry for Tillerson but I do not believe he had our interests at heart. His oil interests are his "heart" & I guess he can return to that, huh?
3456 2018-03-14 16:31:55 They're playing @ParkerMcCollum on the radio out here in New Mexico. I guess the oil field really isn't that bad

3458 2018-03-14 16:31:47 I finally got the black castor oil & flaxseed eco style gel. I'm so exited to try it in my wash and go routine to see if it changes my life
3459 2018-03-14 16:31:46 About to put coconut oil in my hair after @merio Snapchats 
3460 2018-03-14 16:31:44 The boom in #offshoredrilling in the Mediterranean may help cut #Europe’s dependence on Russian oil; but what about it’s conflict-stricken relationship with #NorthAfrica and the #MiddleEast? #BigOil
3461 2018-03-14 16:31:38 Trying to buy oil for my car and I found a really cute stealing wheel cover 
3462 2018-03-14 16:31:06 Oil undoubtedly a bonus, but I suppose all the refugees were imaginary.

Iraq, Iran behaving like an adult?
Or not wanting historic anti Jew Governments to fall?


3463 2018-03-14 16:30:58 Yes this is good beginning @DavidSuzuki & the Green Party are behind refining Tar Sands Oil withing Alberta rather than exporting polluting dilbit & Alberta Jobs

3470 2018-03-14 16:30:11 @talkSPORTDrive how can you debate not going to the World Cup when our countries will still be full trading partners.  Sport is something we should keep separate.  We won't even impose sanctions against them as we need their Oil and gas.  Hypocritical to not  go when we trade
3471 2018-03-14 16:29:30 @Ihnatko I was looking at expensive oil poppers for a while and when you mentioned the stir crazy it was a godsend. We still use it like 2 years later and love it. Thank you sir.

Try the 4oz Great Northern All in One Packs, movie styled popcorn gold!
3472 2018-03-14 16:29:23 Indeed, we used most of our oil for a long time but Norway use very little of their own oil, UK is their one of their biggest customers.
3473 2018-03-14 16:29:19 It's about time we ALL start taking responsibility for the job choices made by INDIVIDUAL women so that half of ALL jobs are held by women. Only then will we have true equality. Let's start with plumbers!! #MoreWomenPlumbers
3474 2018-03-14 16:29:15 Excellent point.  Surely this is market sensitive information and should be subject of an RNS very shortly if turns out we have commercially sellable oil!!!
3475 2018-03-14 16:29:04 i know how to solve the problem with mexico, lets all flock there, good weather cheap land as well as good oil reserves and minerals, they want to be part of us lets take them over divide into proper states and make it part of the union.
3476 2018-03-14 16:29:02 It was never worth the risk. Big oil just "persuaded" politicians hat it was.

3479 2018-03-14 16:28:36 It’s from my book. Just a small part of chapter two about the context of oil elites. Still tons to be done on this and the general spread of domestic laws meant to codify decolonization and sovereignty.

3482 2018-03-14 16:28:19 Are you kidding?

Americans use 100 billion plastic bags a year, which require 12 million barrels of oil to manufacture.
It only takes about 14 plastic bags for the equivalent of the gas required to drive one mile.

I think that CBD oil could prove helpful, for my chronic & often intractable migraine, as well as fibromyalgia. Instead I have spent the better part of two years, in my migraine "cave" due to extreme pain!

3490 2018-03-14 16:27:43 Growth is fading. Bad retail sales, flattening yield curve, lower oil, yet worries about inflation = the S word.

As for plastic from plant divers, well if it is more cost efficient, I'm sure someone will do it...unless special interest groups / big oil get gov't to put up tons of roadblocks

3540 2018-03-14 16:20:52 Then why be stuck in the past with an emphasis on coal and oil?
3541 2018-03-14 16:20:49 Interestingly you and Paul have a different view on this. Both positive views. So that is good. Too much negative thinking going on. Heid only likes to think positive.

Tillerson: Russia is about to supply China with all the oil it needs.

Trump: go figure out how we can get a piece of the action. 

Tillerson: Putin is too busy laughing at our media coverage that I couldn’t make a deal.
3546 2018-03-14 16:20:26 @MeganMayday It's great to be prepared!  Although, we think we sense a bit of sarcasm. When's the last time you had an oil change?
3547 2018-03-14 16:20:24 Uuum, I don't think Artur voted for any UK government. Diesel cars have existed for longer than previous 3 administrations. All parties influenced by intense lobbying from oil company’s and car makers.
3548 2018-03-14 16:20:22 Are you going to be rejecting donations made by corporations headed by Russian oligarchs in future? What is an offshore oil and gas firm's interest in the Calder Valley anyway?

3556 2018-03-14 16:19:04 It's time for nations committed to free societies and fair rules to use #Magnitsky style sanctions against garchs & thugs

3579 2018-03-14 16:17:18 Bom. Demanda maior por oil no mundo. Se a demanda por oil crescer mais do que a oferta, ao longo do tempo, o oil se torna mais raro e, consequentemente, passa a valer mais. Com oil mais caro, a PETR4 terá receita maior. 

Fatores que aumentam a demanda por oil são bons, fatores

3587 2018-03-14 16:16:30 Re: larger issues you raise, I agree that conflict will only intensify in the Middle East as oil supplies dwindle. Proxy wars have huge human toll - and blowback that affects us directly at home too.

3630 2018-03-14 16:11:03 But @BlairKing_ca anyone looking at the tweets you’ve been busy posting looks like you are very much indeed promoting something...just as I’ve been steadfast against oil tankers and oil spills off our coast. I prefer to believe in facts!

3640 2018-03-14 16:09:54 On CBC today The Current talking up LNG as alternative to dirty oil especially replacement in north totally eliminating any discussion of alternatives and renewables. Stop pandering to gas is cleaner when electricity storage already available.

3659 2018-03-14 16:08:27 Guy at my husband’s station chased a motorcycle through a field, put a hole in the oil pan and blew the engine. He wasn’t allowed to drive.

3675 2018-03-14 16:06:32 Maybe we should look at whether oil production predates the communities rather than look at straight production. If production comes after communities are created I'd admit that's a problem. If not, not so much.

3686 2018-03-14 16:04:54 Oil! I switched to an oil cleanser years ago which has helped big time, and I use an oil at night as a moisturizer. Vitamin E is classic for fading discoloration but there are other types you can use for added benefits

3688 2018-03-14 16:04:50 There wont be a war with Russia.

Simply as there is no profit in it, either for Putin or the West.

They only want wars that make them rich or that serve the Globalist power structure  ( eg for Oil, Arms Companies, Banks, Corporations or Israel )
3689 2018-03-14 16:04:43 Canada can't even get a pipeline to east or west coast built. Meanwhile USA built 10,000 miles of pipe under Obama as well as ramped up oil + LNG exports.

3763 2018-03-14 15:57:13 Bisacodyl 
But Contraindicated in pregnancy bc increase utrine contraction so be careful about it..... 
Or use castor oil, olive oil and get doble benefits
3764 2018-03-14 15:57:12 @RepBradWenstrup Now is the time for a gas tax. Oil and gasoline prices are low. A 15¢ a gallon tax would hardly be noticed and could pay for infrastructure repairs.

3766 2018-03-14 15:57:05 Asian carp has bones everywhere -_-
You have to fry it, then the bones just melt from the hot oil so there's no bones to choke on if it's the right side. All melted away.
3767 2018-03-14 15:56:59 Wonder about FE after today, and what arrows appear. I will admit that I suspect that we'll get an up fractal cycle now that we bounced at 60 again. Shorted until 60.20 for a decent profit. FE was last at -71 before today's 60 test so I'll wait for FE/arrow before making a move.
3768 2018-03-14 15:56:43 It’s oil that corrects uneven skin tone
3769 2018-03-14 15:56:33 ok...as many people respect your opinion....what is your thinking?
3770 2018-03-14 15:56:28 I’ve been using meds and coconut oil to grow my hair back/stop the loss. I had a huge swollen spot last night that hurt, it huuuurt. I put some aloe on it before bed and woke up to no swelling. Well ok. Aloe it is.
3771 2018-03-14 15:56:10 PNW, where all of those things exist. But I still see plenty of people in 40s buying gas guzzler SUVs they really do not need.
When I protested Shell oil rig, our numbers were thin, and more boomers and raging grannies (80s-90s).
3772 2018-03-14 15:56:06 And, much like a snake oil salesman, hype is all that he has. No substance whatsoever.
3773 2018-03-14 15:55:56 Yup my grandma would reuse the frying oil for every fucking meat we’d be eating chicken tasting beef 
3774 2018-03-14 15:55:45 Fair play to @BerryGarage, had a minor oil leak since a service/MOT. Fixed free of charge.

3775 2018-03-14 15:55:43 RE last RT: Always think I'd struggle with veganism. Which I would. But, say, a month of rice, lemony oil things, hummus, pastry spinach situations, falafels, butter beans, absolute minty onion salads, etc., would be lovely. Easily the best vegan food imo.

3778 2018-03-14 15:55:30 Thanks for reaching out, Robert. Our Coffee-mate liquid products do not contain palm oil.
3779 2018-03-14 15:55:27 I've been using Pure Marula oil since January and honestly I can say I love it. It's the only thing I put on my face except water. I haven't seen a breakout in months!
3780 2018-03-14 15:55:03 Today in the #US there are twice as many jobs in #solar than in coal, oil, and gas combined - economic growth and climate progress go together #GLOBEforum @FelipeCalderon

3785 2018-03-14 15:54:30 OMG MY ART TWIN?! NOT CLICKBAIT?? Oil is interrsting but pretty fun! Real happy abt the fact that the color u mix is the color it dries as unlike acrylic paint. And also the blending  REAL NICE
3786 2018-03-14 15:54:14 Please do not for one minute, miss my snake oil reference.  I taketh the piss with this sort of marketing BS
3787 2018-03-14 15:54:09 In CA & CO? Yeah!
3788 2018-03-14 15:53:56 Be happy and use lots of OIL MONEY  #OilyPep 
3789 2018-03-14 15:53:44 I cannot drink coffee for the rest of my life. Thanks to some stupid stomach infection and stupid food poisoning, i could barely eat food for 3 months. I'm slowly getting back to eating oil and i ate an ice scream yesterday!!!
3790 2018-03-14 15:53:26 Nope lol the oil changes the color
3791 2018-03-14 15:53:18 Did your engineering degree teach you about Wokeness? See how uneducated you are? 
3792 2018-03-14 15:53:07 Any kids in your school fighting for mental health help? Walkouts for anti-bullying? Holding Broward Sheriff's office responsible? Permanent psychologist in every school? Metal detectors?

3795 2018-03-14 15:52:43 Y se olvidaron de mandar a los medios para mostrar la otra realidad .. La refinería oil con los trabajadores en la calle ... Vamos cambiando !!!!
3796 2018-03-14 15:52:42 Looking forward to the @JustinTrudeau oil, gas & pipelines tour. I suggest #PMJT start his tour in Saint John #NB, at the nation’s largest refinery, & while in NB, explain why he scuttled #EnergyEast. Perhaps stop in Lac-Mégantic QC on the way and tell them pipelines aren’t safe
3797 2018-03-14 15:52:30 I beg to differ. Finland has no oil, luckily very little religion and extremely high ambitions.
3798 2018-03-14 15:52:29 Kpa guy. “ no one can eat in the shop just Incase you dip your food in a toxic chemical”.  Me. “ so your telling me I can’t dip my corn dog in this here brake fluid or diesel oil? That’s bullshit”.
3799 2018-03-14 15:52:19 Epimax, Coconut oil, olive oil 
3800 2018-03-14 15:52:10 Got it Claire! Thank you lovely, will try this one next time x
3801 2018-03-14 15:52:04 Kevin maybe stick to snake oil and nut supplements idk if conspiracies are in your pay grade
3802 2018-03-14 15:51:54 castor oil ordered!
3803 2018-03-14 15:51:50 It's oil - you know, for snakes?
3804 2018-03-14 15:51:49 As an engineer myself, I know how stupid and uneducated we tend to be. I mean, I’m so stupid I had to get Velcro shoes because I can’t remember how to tie shoelaces.
3805 2018-03-14 15:51:35 Oil money
3806 2018-03-14 15:51:34 Yield curve flattening, low retail sales, lower oil, but possible inflation = you know what.
3807 2018-03-14 15:51:18 Yield curve flattening, low retail sales, lower oil, but possible inflation = you know what.
3808 2018-03-14 15:51:15 Russia has the biggest oil reserves in the world. 65 million acres. In the ocean
 Because not enacting sanctions means it's easier for Putin to get his oil. Export it. He gets his money which means payday for Trump.
Which is why Trump criticizes everyone but Putin/Russia

3811 2018-03-14 15:50:54 Charcoal face scrubs and Argan oil (like, the tiniest amount on the spots) seemed to be the only thing that removed the discoloration. I have hypersensitive mixture skin. My cystic acne is on my jaw line
3812 2018-03-14 15:50:53 Yes, we were all saying that. Tillerson has a huge stake in oil on Russian land. He's also gotten that "best friend of Russia" award or something. Yet it was Tillerson who defied tRump by siding with congress on sanctions, for good reason.  Tillerson proved to be a good American.
3813 2018-03-14 15:50:27 I’m so sick of this “gender gap” nonsense. First of all, I thought gender was a societal construct. Did they ask all chefs their pronouns? If not, how do they know 50% or more don’t identify as female?!
3814 2018-03-14 15:50:26 Cunners...do you agree with Brian's thinking re sidetrack?
3815 2018-03-14 15:50:21 Is oil oily
3816 2018-03-14 15:50:20 ... How is the oil paint on my painting STILL WET, what sorcery is this??
3817 2018-03-14 15:50:12 Did u dunk ur pecker in oil then slap it on the ground
3818 2018-03-14 15:49:54 I'm a huge fan of font-awesome but I feel like someone should start creating industry-specific icons. For ex. I work in Oil & Gas, it'd be great to have a wide range of icons representing wells, contracts, shapefile data, pipelines etc.
3819 2018-03-14 15:49:51 It's stupid.  If Daylight saving time is year round, DO YOU REALIZE THAT NORTHERN PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY, IT WON'T GET SUN RISE TIL AFTER 8AM. YOU HAVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS KIDS WAITING FOR BUSES IN THE DARK. This was done in the 70s under Nixon Oil crisis to save money Didn't work
3820 2018-03-14 15:49:46 It has frustrated me for 35 years. We used to play the Ft. McMurray Oil Barons, and they committed five fouls to our one, but the calls were even. When we played the Canucks, they were screwed the same way about 3-1, but the calls were even. Smart teams use ref tendencies.

3822 2018-03-14 15:49:21 Trump hired an oil executive as Secretary of State, yet reporters are acting like Tillerson was some standard republican politician who was forced on Trump by the party.
3823 2018-03-14 15:49:20 #ast #astgas investment go down the plug hole.  Go and tackle someone like 88E who are telling their investors they've got a conventional oil play when they haven't. I have my sources.  All IMO.

3825 2018-03-14 15:49:13 Canada pushes dirty oil, China embraces solar.

New solar cell keeps power flowing by capturing kinetic energy from raindrops
A solar panel that can generate electricity from falling raindrops has been invented, enabling power to flow when skies cloud over or the sun has set.

3831 2018-03-14 15:47:49 For a long time I hated living on the Prairies. I mean I definitely don’t fit in living in a small oil/farming city but one day I was driving somewhere and the sunrise over a field made me realize how beautiful it is.

3860 2018-03-14 15:45:09 Those who think the revenue from North Sea oil should have been put away in a pot for a rainy day....ummm...it was already raining and the country needed the revenue to rebuild itself and keep up with others by modernising...whats the point of having savings and living in poverty
3861 2018-03-14 15:45:04 I also have an injured neck. Had surgery on it but still I get pain. Try CBD oil. You can buy it on line.
3862 2018-03-14 15:44:58 The parking requirement for restaurants began in 2011.  Pretty recent history.  Here’s the context you are missing: Houston has been run by large oil companies, gas has been cheap, politicians love big freeway projects, people like their cars.  Things are changing but slowly.

3898 2018-03-14 15:41:41 so are you... i have your oil can in my office tin man
3899 2018-03-14 15:41:41 Does it need to be said that the original post doesn't blame the facial military presence on the soldiers, and that "because oil" is pretty clearly an allusion to the policy makers? I mean, it's not like soldiers are pocketing that oil, smuggling it home, and retiring rich.
3900 2018-03-14 15:41:29 @realDonaldTrump Who is going to replace Rick Perry at the Department of Energy?

The ideal candidate should be a rich, greedy former oil executive. How about Rex Tillerson?

3909 2018-03-14 15:40:30 As others have commented, it's not that simple. Tight oil tends to be very high API - very light. Needs heavy oil to blend and refine. Surplus gets exported.

3945 2018-03-14 15:36:24 Actually, no.  That’s the problem.  They have not invested in their oil and gas production.  Much of it is in the COLDEST parts of Russia.  If they turn off the machinery, it FREEZES and it can cause mechanical failure.  Also, they don’t have enough storage and have to sell

3977 2018-03-14 15:33:04 I’m certainly not looking past it—I just think that markets would be shut and a reset implemented under such a scenario. A terrible few days or up to a week is possible. But the 80% decline would be (ultimately) nominal and perhaps most visible in real terms against oil and gold.

4051 2018-03-14 15:27:02 What about Sodor? We surprisingly have very large oil reserves. Considering 90% of the island's electricity comes from hydraulic power from the dam at Peel Godred. So that leaves plenty of coal and oil for locomotives and non-rail vehicles.
4052 2018-03-14 15:26:43 I just read that if Tillerson takes another job at any rival oil company he forfeits about $180 million in deferred compensation that he got when he left Exxon.

4056 2018-03-14 15:26:30 That's right. Same with Saddam he wanted to be paid in Euros for his oil. That's why The US invaded. Kennedy also shot because he wanted to abolish the Fed.

4065 2018-03-14 15:25:44 No, because you're making an absurd argument that you aren't allowed to use oil if you think buddying up with Vlad Putin marks someone as too immoral and conflicted to be Sec of State.

4105 2018-03-14 15:21:39 As Norway gets 30b a year and UK claim a billion the figures do not stack up. UK oil revenue should be based on Norway figures as they are real. Accountancy figures put it somewhere else

4111 2018-03-14 15:21:03 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
4112 2018-03-14 15:20:40 agree, but it also has large army that its willing to use with a sig degree of impunity, v little debt, and many European states rely on its oil and gas for energy so (unfortunately) has something going for it
4113 2018-03-14 15:20:35 It is indeed a big problem but if we don't crash now and get it over with, a future crash (caused by recession, low oil price, etc) will be even bigger since prices would have climbed even higher by then. It's either big but manageable crash now, or disastrous crash later.
4114 2018-03-14 15:20:34 Er - OK. I have no interest in what the alt-right may or may not think. But snake oil merchants and faux-science aren't my bag.

4123 2018-03-14 15:19:30 At least w CBD oil there are no side effects & if any wd at all maybe a dull headache at worst. It works great for so many. Research everything yourself & read real ppl reviews on all meds. You’ll figure it out. There is no quality of life in constant excruciating pain! 
4124 2018-03-14 15:19:24 Northeast win is ominous for BJP. Now in BJP's kundli sadhe saati is there. Modi has to go Shani Shingda Temple in Navaratri on Saturday to offer oil and an iron ax to a Brahmin. Preferably Arnab Goswami.

4187 2018-03-14 15:14:48 Oil left group 
4188 2018-03-14 15:14:40 GOP refuses to admit it bc they are too beholden to the gun industry just like they are to the oil industry.
4189 2018-03-14 15:14:34 Just riding the Es and Oil down, I should be in the cad too
4190 2018-03-14 15:14:24 Oil is more cyclical than seasonal, however, over the last 10 years, the $USO has had its best single month of the year in April on average gaining over 5%.  So if you like oil, seasonally this is the time.  $XLE $DJIA $SPX #OilPrice

4196 2018-03-14 15:13:59 And still didn't answer the question that's being asked.  Nobody can't explain the plan for after oil.  Not a single person.  Yet everyone wants the oil to stay in the ground except has anyone actually done the research on how important oil is to us?

4198 2018-03-14 15:13:56 Lol I really can't stand him... He panders a lot and says convenient things so he can keep his following. He's like snake oil salesman to me but he keeps his following cuz he says what he knows women want to hear.

Sometimes he's honest but I sense heavy disingenuous from him.

4200 2018-03-14 15:13:45 Crude oil continues to lead equities lower here. Waiting on WTI to break $60 and $SPX to break 2,750. We could see 2,700 on $SPX by Friday if this happens. #OOTT $USO
4201 2018-03-14 15:13:38 If you drive into b lot and immediately stop your car to let your kids out and then check you oil and change your tires and put gas in your tank. Nobody likes you
4202 2018-03-14 15:13:30 And then you say the problem is that you have to use "words" to describe what you do. Are you a snake oil salesman?

4206 2018-03-14 15:13:19 You are buying the snake oil.. no one is blocking him. GOP control both the house & the senate. PA’s result is proof that people will not be lied to.
4207 2018-03-14 15:13:15 1) drink lots of water

4209 2018-03-14 15:13:11 I’ve also heard the the tarte rainforest of the sea foundation is good for people with dry skin. You could also try adding an oil to your routine! I’m using the 100% plant derived squalane from The Ordinary rn & I really like it & feel it’s helped with dryness since I got it
4210 2018-03-14 15:13:04 @KHOU 2day is the 3rd day in the criminal trial of James French- accused of defrauding Texans of $$$ of their hard earned $$$ in an oil & gas scam. I took a civil judgment against him for fraud. #Justice

4218 2018-03-14 15:12:38 Water mainly. That is the most critical natural resource. They are selling off aquifer rights to Nestle and Coca-Cola. And pipelines and fracking pollute water as does drilling for oil. 

Trump didn't altogether kill solar yet, just broke its legs. Plenty of tax breaks for oil.

4224 2018-03-14 15:12:06 Frequent use of my favourite Orange & Lime solid hand balm from @heavenlyskin ; or Norwegian Formula; Body Shop Argan Oil hand cream and almond hand/nail cream are also good.
4225 2018-03-14 15:12:05 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
4226 2018-03-14 15:12:03 Roast some half ripe plantain & slice it on the side of your salad with ghee or coconut oil. Massage some kale with bacon grease, toast, & crumble over your lettuce w/ some bacon. Roast some fish and flake over your salad, then squeeze some lime & lemon juice over it all. 
4227 2018-03-14 15:11:17 You may be right. Time to shut down the oil industry.
4228 2018-03-14 15:11:13 Well it is a lovely place.. you stayed at OIL quarters?
4229 2018-03-14 15:11:02 SO tired of the "Big Oil" argument!
Can you idiots not see that it is the regular man that is losing. Home foreclosures, small business closures, rising unemployment. "Big Oil" loses money and they recover profits by laying off more workers.
Grow Up!

4233 2018-03-14 15:10:41 I hadn’t converted the engines to run on logs like I had with Ferdinand. I keep them to the island and only the island. And to turn wood to oil take years of pretrification
4234 2018-03-14 15:10:32 I've always preferred clear glosses as my "highlighter". Been doing this for years. I love Honest Beauty magic balm or The Ordinary cold pressed rose hip oil. Dab a bit on top of cheeks, eyebrows, and cupids bow for a lovely glow!

4246 2018-03-14 15:09:34 this is what big oil fears the most: eTransit and eTrucking. the upcomomg diesel demand drop will be the canary in the coal mine for petro states and the oil industry... #stopkm
4247 2018-03-14 15:09:29 @michaelsantoli Hey Mike, how come no one is making the connection between oil and equities ? If oil breaks 60, the market will feel it.

4250 2018-03-14 15:08:48 Cut them off from SWIFT, reduce the price of crude oil and gas, boycott world cup, expell russian gangsters and their dirty money from London, punish them for what they are doing in Ukraine and Syria. Treat them like the mafia state they are.

4256 2018-03-14 15:08:20 @MelissaLeeCNBC Hey Melissa, you seem the only one interested in the oil/equities connection. If oil breaks 60, the market will feel it.
4257 2018-03-14 15:07:48 Your delusional are you an oil guy?
4258 2018-03-14 15:07:47 Wish I could ignore people as well as I can ignore needing my oil changed.

4267 2018-03-14 15:06:41 Don't you grow enough trees that you could just have the wood turned into oil? Or simply just have them run on logs?
4268 2018-03-14 15:06:23 Students in TX being threatened with suspension if they walkout to support change of gun laws because being part of social change isn’t as important as learning how God created oil on the fifth day #NationalWalkoutDay
4269 2018-03-14 15:06:21 @realDonaldTrump Business Fundamentals are not optimal. As it stands, any nation or Globalist Order (group) can take ideas and copy them, flood us with the copies and our IP laws no longer hold.  In China, the same patents hold in court. You have serious damage to fix. Oil States

4335 2018-03-14 15:00:32 La planta termoeléctrica no funciona ni lo hará, debido a que en nuestro país no se produce Fuel Oil que es uno de los componentes que necesita para arrancar, entre otros, que tampoco se produce.

4337 2018-03-14 15:00:18 "There’s enough demand in North America" is a false statement. The US does not need our oil. They buy because its cheaper than world pricing. When they won't buy it anymore, where does our resource revenue come from?

4339 2018-03-14 15:00:12 dude on quad just asked why my lips look so soft  it’s called coconut oil and don’t look at my mf lips
4340 2018-03-14 15:00:10 Rex was terrible!  But he was fired because Russia just cancel oil deal with Exxon Mobil.   Only reason he was there in first place.  Putin told Trump to hire him and now Putin told Trump to fire him.  Follow the money!
4341 2018-03-14 15:00:09 They are homogeneous population. High oil revenue. Single religion with no religious strife. Moderate ambitions. Not a great role model for United States.

4346 2018-03-14 14:59:24 If you think all of this is organized by Democrats you need to readjust your tinfoil hat.  The majority of America wants more stringent gun laws.  Republicans are also participating in the walkout.
4347 2018-03-14 14:59:23 You are always trying to change the subject. Kids are protesting for stricter gun laws. Dem might have won a heavily Repub district. You embarrass Tillerson by firing him on Twitter and this is the best you can do. No wonder your base is dwindling. You are a snake oil salesman!

4358 2018-03-14 14:58:27 How many of you (like myself) had black ass grandfathers I mean black as oil and both (and their brothers) were all married to the lightest skinned women they could get? Mmm-hmm

4365 2018-03-14 14:57:59 Hi Natasha, we're not currently sending these out on order. You can make your own using an old jam jar, empty margarine tub or any suitable container. Once it's cool, you can then put your leftover fat, grease and oil straight into the bin - Chris
4366 2018-03-14 14:57:38 Those regs? Kept our air and water clean. Kept businesses from ripping off consumers. Kept parks natural and unspoiled by oil rigs or uranium mines. Those tax cuts? Yours and mine go away in a couple years; the 1% get them forever.

4373 2018-03-14 14:56:32 I was working on my snakes in my painting yesterday and the oil paint was not cooperating at all... This morning I thought... Why don't I just ... "But that would be cheating!" .. -there is no such thing... It's my painting I can do what I want.
4374 2018-03-14 14:56:27 As California has emerged as the seat of the resistance to the Trump administration — on issues from immigration to climate change, to offshore oil drilling and marijuana policy — there has been a growing sense of separateness between here and the rest of the country.

4386 2018-03-14 14:54:31 np ;) nowhere is it being used as much as it should, that's even bigger industry than the oil/gas industry - plastics that are 'dependable' on fosile fuels, when there's no need for that, but a lot of $$ are in play, so that why you too probably didn't hear sooner about it

4408 2018-03-14 14:52:00 Or what office can make such declaration? We guess any British office wants to avoid a confrontation with the Mx Gov and ally to be in different markets, i.e. new oil exploitation in Mexico and other trades. No human rights debate was hold when Peña Nieto came to UK 3 years ago.

4461 2018-03-14 14:46:36 No matter the season, your oil ALWAYS needs to be in top shape to get you through it.

4465 2018-03-14 14:46:26 The best way is to start interacting as one nation.  Currently we are not United. Look at the oil Wells in Nigeria, Angola..yet neighbouring countries import oil from overseas.
4466 2018-03-14 14:46:19 The good thing is that at this pace, they will be spending Putin’s money fast.

Since we are at it, let’s make sure they increase oil and gas extraction capacity, which will  hydrocarbon’s world prices = a sure collapse for  the  economy.
4467 2018-03-14 14:46:17 The Petro currency is regulated by the State and It is backed in natural resources as oil, gold, diamonds. Other cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any digital entity neither are backed by any physical good.
4468 2018-03-14 14:46:15 I don’t understand this.  Lower oil means less dollars needed by foreigners to buy the oil.  What am I forgetting?
4469 2018-03-14 14:46:08 When u have a coupon for $50 oil change & filter then, they get you to get your tires rotated. The filter i thought was getting changed is an additional $50 so there goes $120, I have 2 filters in my car.  damn well my baby will be all good for a while.
4470 2018-03-14 14:46:03 I caugh dude who did my X-ray this morning smoking oil in the X-ray room he tried to hide that shit quick when I walk in had smoke coming out his nose and shit
4471 2018-03-14 14:45:53 ofcourseeeeee, go to get my oil changed and they can’t do it because there’s something wrong with my car. GREATTTTTTT!
4472 2018-03-14 14:45:49 just saw someone rub non-diluted tea tree oil on their face in a skincare thread and I have secondhand chemical burns from it
4473 2018-03-14 14:45:47 Perfect time with oil not able to get out of the province. Tanks are filling up and they are building more. Only relief is going to be SDs.

4476 2018-03-14 14:45:27 except, when 45 says it, we justifiably expect he's up to no good.
probably means he plans on giving away a national park to the oil company or something
4477 2018-03-14 14:45:24 Wait.... someone “ordinary” says more women belong in the kitchen and they’re bigots... these clown shoes say it and it’s pioneering gender equality? Do most people know we live in the movie idiocracy?
4478 2018-03-14 14:45:21 Iran deal falling apart could turn out to be quite bearish when either we get spr (excuse) response or opec themselves feel like they can get on board - maybe good excuse to let russia out also... #Oil
4479 2018-03-14 14:45:19 There are some great potential applications for blockchain technology in non-financial areas but the “get on now, we gon’ be rich suckas” segment of the cryptocurrency conversation are unbearable and come across as snake oil salesmen.
4480 2018-03-14 14:45:16 No, I’m not perfect. I only use dry shampoo because it smells good. My hair actually doesn’t need it. In fact it probably is bad for me. It’s almost alarming to see how little oil is in my hair
4481 2018-03-14 14:45:16 How do you consider an Oil and gas stock like ongc ?
4482 2018-03-14 14:45:14 I'm beginning to develop real skills in the area of buying expensive olive oil that is really average tasting.
4483 2018-03-14 14:45:08 Check my responses to others on my twitter about it. They're trying to push products draw as a big deal. Where were they back in late 2017 when we sat here and saw those same BIG product draws? 5k crude build is a bit more than twice what the expectation was. This is bearish.

4485 2018-03-14 14:44:53 How will visiting factories help these people? Why have you never visited the oil industry to show solidarity? They employ many times more than steel mills. 
Why don’t you do something not simply symbolic but that actually helps the entire country? Like resigning.

People don’t like a bloviating man-child as their leader.
4512 2018-03-14 14:42:41 It is bearish..but the market is perceiving it as products build vs crude draw now. They have to take it above 61.39 for any significant long  move..otherwise 60 is fair game.

4518 2018-03-14 14:42:15 That’s because “British Interests” as they are commonly quoted is code for the interests of powerful oil, arms & banking interests, not those of joe public.
4519 2018-03-14 14:42:12 Typo earlier. I meant we had product builds (not production builds) in late 2017 and the oil market ignored it. So now they're happy about it? That was my point. I find it hard to believe that products are a huge story while the world is swimming in oil. Oh well.
4520 2018-03-14 14:41:57 I'm running out of Maracuja oil. I don't want spend $17 on another 1 oz bottle, so imma try sweet almond oil next.
4521 2018-03-14 14:41:49 Mr,G, Looking at the results and the forecast, I wonder who's oil supply they were looking at. I would expect oil to drop, but not so much so far.
4522 2018-03-14 14:41:48 They use bacterial toxin to fix wrinkles, why not use bee venom?WHY STOP THERE? We could use snake venom! Oils are big now, let's sell it as an oil! Now presenting cure-all snake oil! ...oh wait...

4588 2018-03-14 14:35:54 We had huge production builds during late 2017 yet the market was obsessed by the crude draws. So why would it be now relevant? Check Gulf Coast storage to get an idea of the real story behind oil right now. Oversupply in oil.

4611 2018-03-14 14:33:32 The US produces just 2.3 mill bbl per day of crude oil, the rest is heavy oil and different varations of condensate. Crude oil production in the US is likely to decline further, only condensate is growing.
4612 2018-03-14 14:33:32 Dollar down.  Gas prices stay up? USA produces most of what we use. Not too sure how domestic oil can claim poverty and keep gas prices up.
4613 2018-03-14 14:33:30 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
4614 2018-03-14 14:33:30 Was just a matter of time. Expect oil rigs, fracking, etc

Millions of acres of America’s public lands and waters, including some national monuments and relatively pristine coastal regions, could be auctioned off for oil and gas development, with little thought for environmental
4615 2018-03-14 14:33:19 that wasn't supposed to happen

4628 2018-03-14 14:32:09 Of course its a FRAME they have been asked by there paymasters in the USA to help them out cos USA wants there hands on Russian gas & oil + Russia has kicked out the USA bank Rothchild cos Putin will not allow them to behave like they did in 2008 in the UK

4783 2018-03-14 14:18:59 In my view, Iran will be selling as much oil as possible as theyprobably cannot sell any oil when sanctions are re-introduced. So, short term oil will be lower, longer term higher.

4786 2018-03-14 14:18:24 And it they protect it..the major upside cap is at 66.66..next at 64.24 and then 63.28..so if EIA  is good, price will be contained by these caps and it will range until the next attack at the bunghole.

4791 2018-03-14 14:17:52 WTF was Putin thinking? Expect more bad decisions to come from him. Fading power with a tiny economy and sooner or later no one's going to want their oil and gas...
4792 2018-03-14 14:17:43 Rex Tillerson was my, indirect and way up the food chain, boss when I worked as a landman for a oil and gas broker in southern Oklahoma. His orders were to "Force Pool" land/mineral owners without negotiating oil/gas lease, but when it came time to "Frac/drill" on his land. Nope!
4793 2018-03-14 14:17:29 the democracy erosion in the u.s. is an internal problem, not the fault of "the foreigners."  if you're not concerned with Putin's agenda, then why worry if he owns as many legislators as weapons manufacturers, oil & gas or the pharmaceutical lobby?  the oligarchy is not new

5026 2018-03-14 13:53:58 Rockefeller's Standard Oil was sued from 1895-1911; he was guilty of dropping the price of refined petroleum from 30 cents a gallon in 1869 to 8 cents a gallon. Great for the consumers/economy, bad for competitors. Antitrust creates the incentive to be purposely less competitive.

5034 2018-03-14 13:53:39 Putin's cronies loot Russian oil money and buy homes in London to park their assets somewhere with the rule of law. Targeted sanctions bite these people hard, and they're the people Putin listens to.

5042 2018-03-14 13:53:01 A true patriot? One that dismantles the entire agency?
One that has Putin as one of his close friends? One that is looking to further his oil deals with foreign governments? Just wait till he joins the private sector to make zillions on trading USA for oil leases.
5043 2018-03-14 13:52:52 I spent an hour this morning taking off my lash extensions with olive oil and now my eyes have been watering all day

5050 2018-03-14 13:52:31 The stocks of PSU banks saw a relief rally for the second consecutive  day. Shares of state-run banks have been under severe selling pressure  of late after the Punjab National Bank scam was reported on 14 February  2018. Stocks of public sector oil marketing companies  tumbled.
5051 2018-03-14 13:52:27 Midnight oil change...
5052 2018-03-14 13:52:22 Agree, its possible. But protectionism should lead to less dollars in the system...and god help us if oil falls to $40... then the dollar shortage explodes.

5085 2018-03-14 13:48:48 no such thing as zero emissions. The plane uses battery. Battery needs huge charging of electricity. Electricty  from coal fired power station. more coal used for more battery charging. Tires made from oil.

5100 2018-03-14 13:47:09 Just an FYI a lot of people are allergic to tea tree and have an allergic reaction that causes extremely dry skin. I personally have this reaction and only found out when I used a tea tree face wash! Charcoal soap works really well for cleaning these and so does coconut oil

5105 2018-03-14 13:46:53 Ok, Be careful the infection doesn’t spread, check 4 swollen glands under chin or pain in sinus area. Eugenol is a dental medication, sold as oil of cloves.....it may help. Seek treatment if it’s bad, worst case, it can enter your bloodstream(rare) sorry
5106 2018-03-14 13:46:51 Yeah.  We should nationalize our banks, take over our oil companies, declare open borders, and give everybody a living wage.  Kamala is a Socialist.  She believes is socialist programs that have NEVER worked ANYWHERE.  She's from California.

5132 2018-03-14 13:42:59 There was a time when the Russian economy was on the brink of collapse due to low oil prices. The US could have kept the screws tight and sank their government and economy forcing Putin out of office. Now look at Crimea and Ukraine. Oh to have a time machine.

5160 2018-03-14 13:40:02 @ZeeNewsHindi Is the cost of oil digged in India equivalent to oil imported from Middle east? If yes, then how? If no, then how can the Selling Prices be same? Is this money being utilized to destabilize stable telecom biz or funding professional voters for political parties?
5161 2018-03-14 13:39:54 Find a sensible Muslim who will label an entire nation or religion as criminal due to radicals. I mean Bush declared war on Iraq, today we know it was unjust and an invasion for oil killing 500,000+ civilians. Is this not terrorism?

So we all have our own radicals to deal...

5173 2018-03-14 13:38:42 The search for good water data should include the old and dusty logs from the oil sector; much of it funded by Norwegian assistance programs from more than 40 years ago. Where is the oil sector in #sdg6? #recycle #norwegianoillegacy
5174 2018-03-14 13:38:33 Can't say I feel confident enough to go long oil, and it's basically trading sideways, which is no bueno when holding onto a leveraged ETF. These funds bleed value - over time - in a sideways market.

5177 2018-03-14 13:38:25 While I agree about the magnitude of the disaster's effects, oil, or worse, hot bitumen flowing down your street tends to invoke a bigger magnitude of response. So it's worth pointing out the potential. #PinotNotPipelines #StopKM

5195 2018-03-14 13:36:48 Slightly bullish, but overall, prospects of supply rising if oil does rally are good, and that'd keep anything in check. Market has already ignored much of this possibility.

5197 2018-03-14 13:36:33 Other groups have tried that and yet these oil companies continue to do what they want, unobstructed, while the case is in court and an order of injunction has been passed.

5200 2018-03-14 13:36:15 Germany Europe’s strongest economy is also pretty interventionist as is France, Portugal and most successful European economies. The U.K. wasted it’s windfall from North Sea oil in tax cuts and supporting disaster capitalism while Norway set up an investment fund.

5202 2018-03-14 13:36:13 Why no one returned when entering was simply a matter of stepping through a floating oil slick for one. If the oil-slick gate was one-way, what would be the point of retreat? Why, if not one-way, were there not volunteers studied who had gone in and out.

Key Republicans RonPaul, Giuliani, Ralph Peters, Gen Flynn, F Graham Jim Bakker religious right publicly saluted Putin in 2014 for his “Christian” “morality” & Ukraine “decisiveness.” 2014 oil declines were actual commonality. Ru & R’s at this a long time.
5212 2018-03-14 13:35:25 So they won't be able to sell us gas, oil and wheat while we won't be able to sell them Range Rovers....
5213 2018-03-14 13:35:20 You do realize that illegal immigrants send $25 BILLION to Mexico alone every year? That’s more than their oil exports. We need to choke off that revenue stream from what is basically a Mexican government sanctioned illegal pillaging of the US. #buildthewall
5214 2018-03-14 13:35:16 Not a fan of big oil Tillerson but he was the most capable and reasonable of Trumps team and did a good job.  Trump is just a baby man.. Obama didnt fire everyone who disagreed with him.

5239 2018-03-14 13:33:17 I agree with a lot of this thread, but I don't want to paint with too broad a brush. There are both snake oil hustlers and legit hard-working results-drivers (yikes, that sounds jargon-y) in all disciplines within SEO.

5247 2018-03-14 13:32:15 And another thing you miss as obviously not Scottish is! If we had the oil money for our own people instead of being robbed! Scotland do just fine. Also why does EU want age of consent down to 12-13? To me they all nonces. Afternoon. toodle pip.

5262 2018-03-14 13:30:27 You can’t ignore the fact that ‘oil money’ has got City to where you are now. Without it, I doubt you would be in a position to attract these lucrative deals.

5460 2018-03-14 13:09:35 So, there's conclusive evidence the Russians did it?  Sorry if questioning govt, but we all know where that got us before ... #IraqWar and we all know that was over oil, nothing else...  Russia is one of the countries with significant fossil fuel deposits, so excuse my skepticism

5462 2018-03-14 13:09:26 So we say Germany building pipeline to ask them to help UK what about Yamal LNG UK in big time there including blast buildings being designed in northeast and built on uk JV in Philippines? Pull out of that project with total oil then others will maybe follow your stance

5465 2018-03-14 13:09:18 3-However, those do not take place immediately and there are a lot of other variables of the demand structure. That is why average API of the crude oil demanded by the U.S. refineries has not changed much in the last decade.

5486 2018-03-14 13:06:15 super jealous! I wish we could turn the heat off here. Would certainly lessen the amount of oil used. Still looks like winter over here.
5487 2018-03-14 13:06:13 I reckon there's a similar process going on in oil market now, but at supertanker pace. However, it can (& probably will) rapidly tip over into financial oil market where Clearing Houses substitute for Clearing Banks as single points of failure

5494 2018-03-14 13:04:56 Tech in the oil and gas sector is constantly advancing because it is privately funded. They are finding new ways to extract more oil and gas cheaper from more formations previously overlooked. Everything that has happened over the last 30years says that your thinking is flawed
5495 2018-03-14 13:04:55 2-If the same trend continues, we might see higher discounts to increase the demand. Eventually, that might change things for the outlook of the upcoming years. Higher discounts to brent might encourage refineries to make infrastructure investments to use more of the lighter oil.

5498 2018-03-14 13:04:43 Easier to modify above-ground bus rapid-transit, based on usage. Of course, congestion pricing, which is really just pricing, could remove traffic instantly. But the road builders and oil companies benefit from slow-moving traffic jams. #brt #economics #congestionpricing

The demand of Asian markets to lighter shale oil will play an important role. So far, API gravity of the exported oil is not much on the higher end of 40.

5572 2018-03-14 12:55:23 This is what happens when  the GOP decided to back a lying snake oil salesman  and his crime family to destroy the country. The country votes them out.  It will take years to repair the republican party.

5588 2018-03-14 12:53:48 Honestly, I don’t care what Tillerson thinks. He was an oil man who was unqualified for the position, in an administration no one should be a part of.
5589 2018-03-14 12:53:47 Is it oil or the purchasing power of the USD? USD was linked to gold until 71. Ratio was fixed. However since then, dollar linked to oil trade; but not a fixed ratio. What if oil is severely undervalued due to severe overvaluation of USD?
5590 2018-03-14 12:53:46 I completely have to pay 80$ for an oil change every single time & I get pissed off every time...... So annoyed

5614 2018-03-14 12:51:59 I agree. There is always an instant nostalgia with the Canadian teams. But, I know a lot of folks that work in oil & gas and have been told Alberta is the Texas of the north (or that Texas is the Alberta of the south), so it's fitting!

5883 2018-03-14 12:19:50 The tax revenues raised from the sale of the oil are what the country gets, and as you're still part of the UK, those revenues belong to the UK. Scotland currently receives a share of that tax revenue.

5992 2018-03-14 12:04:02 From Trumps point of view, thinking of this in business terms. Sanctioning Iran means higher oil prices and higher revenues for the US given they are a huge producer of oil now and this is a win win for the Saudis and the Russians too.

6003 2018-03-14 12:02:56 Agreed.  Employing a non-renewable, fundamental resource, such as oil, for something so damaging to the environment, is the sharp end of the stick.  There are viable alternatives, not to mention more rational packaging methods.

6060 2018-03-14 11:53:34 As a baker my only suggestion might be to use half shortening and half butter instead of oil. Same nutritional footprint but you'll get texture and flavour from those fats.

6062 2018-03-14 11:53:24 Refiners will make the money on the diesel and LSFO and take a knock on HSFO. They will minimise HSFO by recycling. Average sulphur content of Fuel oil was 2.45% . To reduce to 0.5% you need to blend 5x light with heavy. That is impossible, so why bother

6128 2018-03-14 11:44:24 The only reason Tillerson is gone is because Exxon/Russia oil deal fell through. Only reason Tillerson was Sec. in first place.

6132 2018-03-14 11:44:02 Seconds away from a 0-0 draw, yet significantly more disappointing and draining than Saturday's 4-1 defeat (which was far from an oil painting itself...)
6133 2018-03-14 11:43:49 Be specific: Anti-Assad interventionism.
US are cowardly letting *their own Allies* in Afrin, the Syrians Kurds, down.
The US, never an inch to protect the weak from the powerful.
Never an inch for real negotiation efforts.
Only there to pour oil on Syria and self benefit from it

6142 2018-03-14 11:42:53 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr Good morning on this 14th of March, 2018. I was looking to fight some Republican loons, but I can't find them. So if you happen to run into any, please do point me towards them. It's a sick day for me, so why not right? How is our FE looking?
6143 2018-03-14 11:42:43 Trend mirrors that of FX liquidity driven mainly by rising crude oil price; hence much of domestic inflation is imported and clearly prone to oil price volatility.
6144 2018-03-14 11:42:37 Not a single oil rich country has ever won a war. Azeris no exception.
6145 2018-03-14 11:42:32 2/ 
The Anti-Assad allies don’t want that Russia/Assad/Iran threat against Israel. Oil, and Assad’s treatment of Syrians are secondary contingents we can’t control. But our security via Israel’s security we can control.
6146 2018-03-14 11:42:30 The moron has prevailed. Now we can have a nice little war with Iraq and steal their oil, stop antagonizing our dear friend Putin and mess with NK hard core. Good times coming.

6179 2018-03-14 11:37:38 He fired Tillerson for two reasons. ExxonMobil backed out of a oil deal with Russia.  And Tillerson spoke out about Russia poisoning a informant & his daughter in the UK.

6215 2018-03-14 11:31:36 there was no liquidity vaccum then..commercial traders have increased because oil supply has increased dramatically and more contracts need to be hedged which will always put downward pressure..and that has attracted non commercial dumb speculative money

6224 2018-03-14 11:30:45 If Tillerson was against an Iran war because of his oil ties to Saudi and Gulf oil disruption, and if the USA attacks Iran. Then surely Russia and China will make their own moves at the same time towards what lands they want.

6246 2018-03-14 11:28:03 Mar.13 (Dow Jones) -- Mexican industrial production was unchanged in January from December, and rose moderately from a year earlier as a pickup in construction helped offset weakness in the oil and gas industry and a slowdown in manufacturing.
6247 2018-03-14 11:27:49 Exxon Mobil win in any event. They have the local domestic oil and gas market, AND export gas as LNG at spot prices via the NSW-Vic pipeline, forcing the domestic gas market to match the LNG spot prices.

6251 2018-03-14 11:27:11 The majority of the EU's gas & oil comes from Russia so they are actively contributing to keeping Putin in power. If anything, some of those EU 'partners' will be a hindrance to taking action against the Russian state in order to protect their own energy supplies.

6398 2018-03-14 11:07:14 The opec oil crisis and cost push resulted in inflation across most countries who adopted the ubiqitous Soc dem model. We moved away from Keynsianism not because IT causes inflation but because the UK embraced the failed neo liberal ideology. An expensive mistake. Unravelling now

6408 2018-03-14 11:05:45 Hey Vince, please don’t lecture clubs that try to live within their means, and generate their own income, when it’s your club’s artificial inflating of wages with oil cash that is one of the causes of ticket prices going up. Maybe you could study it in your business course.
6409 2018-03-14 11:05:00 The problem is that whilst it sounds good, not all units of energy have the same value. So e.g. a battery is massively expensive per joule compared to oil. Like "heat" it is meaningful as a macro measure, but it has problems when considering individual transactions.
6410 2018-03-14 11:04:56 If I told you you could only buy one car and you had to keep that car for the rest of your life you would probably take damn good care of it.

6671 2018-03-14 10:17:41 I actually started taking vitamin a capsules and that really helped me. I also use a gentle cleanser, tone with witch hazel and moisturize with a water based moisturizer. Also for spot treatment specifically I use a drying lotion or tea tree oil

6674 2018-03-14 10:17:24 You are so right man. Over the years I've worked jobs where I'm on my feet for hours at a time and would totally neglect my feet. It wasn't until the last year or so where I started to pay more attention to my feet. Scrub them in the shower, use foot oil, do foot soaks, etc.

6819 2018-03-14 09:56:16 #ukog Are we swabbing at BB? Removing the fluids would cause the bottom hole pressure to increase thys allowing the oil or gas to be pushed out of the well to cause it to start “flowing”. Waste tanker yesterday?
6820 2018-03-14 09:55:56 Put it this way if Nicola offered Scotland's oil in return for independence they'd have the contract printed before the words were out of her mouth.

6832 2018-03-14 09:52:27 In my view, the reason for the underperformance is, that most companies produce condensates, which are selling at a steep discount to crude oil. If condensate prices are not going up, companies will continue to underperform.
6833 2018-03-14 09:52:24 Tillerson has signed illegal oil deals, used torture, & killing to fill his off shore accounts. What should scare all of us is that the man who won a friend of Russia award did a compete 180 on Russia. What does Tillerson know?

6900 2018-03-14 09:39:55 The FC community have an agenda, often funded by oil money. Most H2 comes from natural gas, so they naturally want to keep drilling.

Until you can deeply decarbonise H2 production at huge scale, it's no better than diesel.

Whereas you can buy your electric 100% green, today.

6903 2018-03-14 09:39:11 It is becoming crystal clear.

The west has been played by a master technician in the art of war. 

I predict the next step will be to begin the stopping of pricing oil in Dollars $$.
6904 2018-03-14 09:38:03 It would tighten the oil market markedly if even 1mbpd is taken off the market.

7215 2018-03-14 08:33:14 That price fall coincided with the end of QE, precisely as I forecast it would two years earlier. Oil was financialised & manipulated by the US from 2009 for political (resilience) reasons. Once Saudi realised they transferred reserves to EU - a transfer recently reversed

7925 2018-03-14 05:56:12 For those of you who care about my sobriety updates, I gave in and hit my oil pen (Mostly CBD). But now at least I know I have more self control than I have before. 3 days clean after smoking every day for 2.5 years is a step closer.

7952 2018-03-14 05:50:53 The original Rockefeller, William Avery Rockefeller used to sell snake oil as a cure for certain illnesses of people. He was a conman and a vagabond. He was the father of John D Rockefeller whom he trained to be a shrewd conman like himself.

7985 2018-03-14 05:45:23 You can do it though, but don't use leave in conditioner. Instead, I deep condition me hair and use a water based moisturizer w/ coconut oil & I let it dry completely. Once it's dry, I put oil on my fingertips as I unwrap the knots.

7987 2018-03-14 05:45:13 Agree but it’s still real hard to feel bad for someone so naïve to buy into his snake oil. That side of the aisle has been trying to fuck over union employees for decades now(unless you’re with the police union). This isn’t new.

7990 2018-03-14 05:44:45 It's a rearguard action. Blocking the adoption of renewable and nuclear energy won't achieve much other than to buy time for existing entrenched interests. Gas, coal, and oil face the same fate as candles, horse fodder, and firewood.

8001 2018-03-14 05:43:45 Gotta wash it in cold water, use sulfate free products (I use shampoo and conditioner both by Hair Food) and wash your hair no more than twice a week. The no washing thing sounds gross but the natural oil is good for your hair and only after about a week does mine get greasy.

Republicans are toast. No one is buying the snake oil anymore & Trump just becomes worse & worse every day.

8017 2018-03-14 05:40:43 @GovMaryFallin YOU are the one that needs to realize you better talk with your oil beneficiaries in the legislature and make something happen NOW.  That is what is realistic about this situation.  Education should ALWAYS come first. NOT OIL.

8241 2018-03-14 05:00:15 Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low. -Henry Ward Beecher
8242 2018-03-14 05:00:11 I like to blanch it, strain it off, heat up a cast iron skillet and throw it in there with some good olive oil, salt and pepper and just a ton of good Parmesan cheese. Not the crappy powdered stuff, but some good shredded parmesan. 15 or 20 seconds under the broiler and Walla.

8247 2018-03-14 04:59:20 The oil patch has taught them that a white man with no education & no skills somehow deserves a six-figure income. And the collapse of world oil prices is somehow Justin Trudeau’s fault. As far as I’m concerned, those western bastards can freeze in the dark. #cdnpoli

8252 2018-03-14 04:58:34 #mufc PSG for Mou in the summer methinks. A city he can relocate his family, an oil well of a never ending supply of transfer cash,  less pressurised league, a more suitable climate. Just needs to negotiate his customary pay off. Sadly, he lost his way big time against Sevilla.

8270 2018-03-14 04:56:04 I wonder if with the huge oil deal with Exxon and Gazprom blowing up was the reason. Oh look, Christopher Wray’s law firm represents Gazprom. Maybe Tilly didn’t produce for Putie, and Wray gets a chance.

8341 2018-03-14 04:41:55 Democrats voting with republicans to increase military budget, deregulating banks, voting against single payer while voting pro pharma. Letting the oil industry ahnnilate the planet, pro frakking...
Talk is cheap let their votes speak.
That is why I have issue with democrats.
8342 2018-03-14 04:41:53 Dude imagine how bad the Oil would be without the savior. Crazy. How do you sleep at night???
8343 2018-03-14 04:41:52 I added this oil from esteelauder to my night routine and my skin looks like the norm but it feels so good. 
8344 2018-03-14 04:41:13 To me it’s a perfect game in a lost season. Flames in playoffs would embarrass Oil ownership to the extent that is necessary for big change.

8349 2018-03-14 04:40:29 To say that I was happy with how the Edmonton Oilers team played would be a bit disingenuous. If I told you how 97 (with help from 33 and virtually no help except for brief moments from 93 29) was stopped by Mike Smith from winning this game for the Oil then that would be true.
8350 2018-03-14 04:40:25 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
8351 2018-03-14 04:40:25 im very bored so i had to buy a bottle of this emu oil.

8355 2018-03-14 04:39:34 You should get “oil absorbing” it works for me
8356 2018-03-14 04:39:33 The surge in emerging countries’ growth has heightened global demand for oil, so oil increasingly functions as a barometer for overall global growth.
8357 2018-03-14 04:39:32 I can state with authority that if data is like oil then anyone selling it is completely fucked.
8358 2018-03-14 04:39:07 you can’t stop your skin’s natural state you’ll always have combo skin but what you can do is use an aha (alpha hydroxy acid) treatment which shrinks your oil glands so less oil is produced in those areas

8364 2018-03-14 04:38:11 Higher oil prices tend to increase inflationary pressures, which may lead to higher interest rates. Simultaneously, higher oil prices tend to reduce economic growth by decreasing personal spending. Oil’s impact on growth is more important bc of the speed of consumers’ reaction.

8368 2018-03-14 04:37:06 Steaming room + lavender oil = 
8369 2018-03-14 04:37:05 My advice would be to find products that go with your skin type like let’s say if you’re oily find a face wash and toner that is a bit stronger and not too sensitive and then use water based or oil free moisturizer that way your skin isn’t overloaded with what it doesn’t need
8370 2018-03-14 04:36:46 I need to get some coconut oil for my hair .
8371 2018-03-14 04:35:46 Um. Do you not view the #NRA #NRA as lobbyists? 30 million from them. Over 100 million from the coal and oil industries. Over 100 million from Wall Street banking firms. Jesus. Google. You've somehow mistaken Trump for Bernie Sanders.

Nope.
8383 2018-03-14 04:33:05 There’s an asymmetric bias to the relationship beteeen oil and the US dollar. Oil experiences greater strength in magnitude when the dollar falls than the magnitude of oil falling when the dollar rises.

8395 2018-03-14 04:31:11 @chigrl  Hi from Vancouver! I was recently listening to your interview with Aaron on @chatwithtraders and was wondering if you could show some direction to drill for oil fundamentals and what things to look for. I am a scalper but want to get more fundamental approach. Thank you!

8402 2018-03-14 04:30:31 Like the precious metals & other commodities, oil has a long-term inverse correlation to the USD, even if in the short-term oil can diverge from this relationship because it’s vulnerable to oil-specific supply & demand shocks.
8403 2018-03-14 04:30:17 He said he took the job because his wife made him. He is a wiser businessman than DJT. Made millions as CEO of Exxon, with that 2B oil deal still pending with Russia.  Autocracy is not American. In 2yrs we will not recognize the USA. I hope his base realizes that soon.

8430 2018-03-14 04:27:20 The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stone, but because we had better technology. Same thing should happen with oil. We shouldn't wait until it is all gone. We should start to use new and better technology that more sustainable and environment-friendly.

8463 2018-03-14 04:22:07 For normal folks yes, but for a provincial leader - you basically make real estate the "oil" that greases the economy. Look at BC's "real estate industrial complex" it kept the BC libs in power for ages.
8464 2018-03-14 04:21:23 Mate that is just fuel $$$.
We have a problem and that requires ZERO CO2 emission from whatever the process is. Making LGP, H2 or OIL from coal is not it, unfortunately.
8465 2018-03-14 04:21:19 Merkel is the sponsor of terrorists, like she refused Russian gas and will buy in Azerbaidzhan, she would have said that instead of Russian oil, Chechens will be procured, Azerbazhans will be used in the same way as Ukraine and Belarus.

8519 2018-03-14 04:13:24 Trump has now made it Legal to Kill Animals all year even Bears during Hibernation. He’s allowing Elephant Parts to be brought into the USA. Not to mention taking Millions of National Land to drill Oil, Gas & Coal. He’s a 1 Man wrecking Ball on Environment & Wildlife. #Resist

8521 2018-03-14 04:12:43 Putin is afraid of rebellion in the country and the late 90's, there is nothing to eat chemistry, here he is engaged in agriculture, production is not all imported from China, if Russia cut oil and gas, Russia is more accurate than the USSR to disintegrate
8522 2018-03-14 04:12:39 Vault oil loss after update. Had 12k, now 8k, 4000 oil gone due to some bug. Requiere attention!

8525 2018-03-14 04:12:06 And the Bama;   oil didn't break under 60.16 despite bad builds in API.  I am praying for a gap down but we need a solid follow thru with volume on sell side or we will surely melt the fuck up for a green close 

Best wishes

8550 2018-03-14 04:08:26  try anything oil based
8551 2018-03-14 04:08:22 Yes we deserve to know!

8553 2018-03-14 04:07:56 THE RODEO CLOWN CARTEL in CONJUNCTION with THE SQUIRRELS have been FIXING oil prices can i really be the only person who sees this?
8554 2018-03-14 04:07:54 And pressuring the US against expanded oil drilling is risk abatement. The risk that an oil spill will happen is increased with every new bore.
8555 2018-03-14 04:07:44 I think that organics/carbon are a basis for most products. In each case they are converted to something useful. Burning coal, oil or gas is just a CO2 waste. 
Li-ion batteries ar just an energy sink and can't be successfully recycled. It is unfortunate bt that is the problem.
8556 2018-03-14 04:07:20 @IgathePolycarp see what happened to Tillerson? This politics business is not for Oil execs. Stick to your lane.

8566 2018-03-14 04:03:39 So I learned that if I mix coconut oil and cinnamon and do a wrap I look skinny for a few hours
8567 2018-03-14 04:03:37 They are “hooked” to sugar AND oil AND salt. One isn’t worse than the other, but two are hidden in most food and somehow get a pass.
8568 2018-03-14 04:03:29 The sanctions imposed by the US were because of Venezuela’s dealings with Iran and only affected trade with the US. The fact that oil prices fell dramatically and Venezuela’s economy was based on oil and gas meant that they could no longer fund all of their social programs.

8588 2018-03-14 03:59:49 Nothin like discussed by CBT oil with your customer (teacher) and one of the high school students down at the health food store.  Lol.  (Just there to get a squeeze bottle for olive oil.)
8589 2018-03-14 03:59:47 Glossier’s products work really well INTO an already existing skincare routine. I don’t believe you should use their priming moisturizer by itself but an oil and/or toner before the moisturizer work beautifully!!

8598 2018-03-14 03:58:44 Stephen Colbert just put an action figure of Rex Tillerson in a tiny coffin and filled it with oil. But they didn’t test that in rehearsal, the coffin isn’t water tight, and now the oil is leaking everywhere on Stephen’s desk  #11thHour
8599 2018-03-14 03:58:34 If it's true that Putin wanted him to lift the oil sanctions from Obama........then Rex was his man ....CEO of Exxon with a 9 trillion deal in the balance with Russia. Deals off now.
8600 2018-03-14 03:58:28 Diet Coke and oil.
8601 2018-03-14 03:58:24 Perhaps we'll have to agree to disagree. I haven't seen anyone getting value for those late picks in trade, whether as direct trades or as throw ins. Basically valueless. And as far as picking the player, it's a complete super low probability crap show. So 
8602 2018-03-14 03:58:08 in all honesty, the plain packets I have already seen are nicer than the old ones. I personly used vaping to stop and now have almost no nicotine in my vape oil at all. my partner will not vape but still cannot stop smoking. crazy woman

8607 2018-03-14 03:57:01 Depends on the situation. If its a human rights issue and we go in with the UN or by ourselves im for it. but if its for oil or political reasons then no. Id also support intervention based on if we were attacked.
8608 2018-03-14 03:56:51 Add pure MCT oil like Brain Brew toitand make it even better!
8609 2018-03-14 03:56:35 All the protests have been shut down, people arrested unfairly, Native peoples voices ignored, No one listens. We cannot produce water from oil. I think what is happening is awful and many people agree with me. Clean energy is available, but the govt continues to prop up oil.

8631 2018-03-14 03:52:07 A sales tax is a great idea. Government services and infrastructure should not be funded by oil revenue. Instead, oil revenue should be saved in a rainy day fund.

8658 2018-03-14 03:48:36 No excuse for raw sewage but oil is far worse. Plus air pollution from burning oil is deadly.

8664 2018-03-14 03:47:44 I think it's hypothesizing a highly unlikely benefit that  would only be of value in what I'll bet is a highly unlikely situation. I'll take the player with a non-zero chance of making the NHL.

8709 2018-03-14 03:42:49 I think you way overvalue the extent to which a throwaway late round pick changes the equation on a trade. It just doesn't.

The value of those late round picks is only if you can collect them in large quantities so the probabilities work in your favour.

8755 2018-03-14 03:38:43 If they regulate themself, the oil company that Standing Rock is dealing with wouldn't break the law by putting pipelines across natives land. If companies regulate themselves, Pharma wouldn't charge the US the same amount as they do in Canada.

8800 2018-03-14 03:32:51 Finally a win over the fucking Oilers! Playoffs or not, I couldn’t stomach another loss to the Oil.. #Flames

8802 2018-03-14 03:32:42 My skincare ritual is done, my curls are twisted, I’m covered in body butter and rose oil, I have ice cream. I need something thrilling and/or disturbing to watch on Netflix.
8803 2018-03-14 03:32:35 I agree! Tillerson Oil mogul. Pompeo! CIA -Trained soldier - has the necessary BRASS to keep NK  in check!@realDonaldTrump
8804 2018-03-14 03:32:22 The left would have a lot more credibility claiming Tillerson got fired for criticizing Russia if they hadn’t spent the last year claiming Tillerson’s Russian oil connections were proof of White House collusion with The Kremlin.
8805 2018-03-14 03:32:03 People way overvalue the lottery tickets of late rounds.
8806 2018-03-14 03:32:00 Whoopee! 335,000 people living atop natural hotsprings in Iceland and using them is no lesson for Canada. BTW gasoline is used extensively for transportation in Iceland and it is all imported and pricey, but they're exploring for oil deposits...
Got any more non sequiturs for us?

8810 2018-03-14 03:31:29 K but today I cleaned my car, cleaned my room, did my homework, shaved my legs, AND managed to put coconut oil in my hair all BEFORE 9:30
8811 2018-03-14 03:31:08 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
8812 2018-03-14 03:31:07 There will be an age limit, no?  Manitoba has set one and it's over 18 only.  The medical marijuana they give children is CBD oil, with little or no THC, which is what gives you the high.  It's not like a five year old is going to blaze up a doobie.

8820 2018-03-14 03:29:50 @Schwarzenegger Hey Arnold that's a great idea to sue big oil for killing people. I wish they would turn the tap off.......oh just a min! Wouldn't most of us die then!! Idiot!

8822 2018-03-14 03:29:21 100% true. Oily skin most of the time is actually dry skin! When you wash your face and don’t moisturize you’re not replenishing the oils you just stripped away, which causes your face to overproduce oil to make up for the oils you stripped away.
8823 2018-03-14 03:29:18 え？
8824 2018-03-14 03:29:04 How many cans of motor oil did you spread all over your body during your bodybuilding career, Arnie?

8826 2018-03-14 03:28:59 Using coconut oil to grow more facial hair but where is the cute thighs?
8827 2018-03-14 03:28:43 market had less participants in 2014 ,it moved up/down in liquidity vaccum. nowadays there are plenty of bulls and bears. Not easy to move oil price too steep in either direction.
8828 2018-03-14 03:28:34 No, the expectation should've been to get a draft pick that could've been either used to bring in a kid or as part of a trade in the off-season. Aberg isn't likely to have much of an impact.

8833 2018-03-14 03:28:01 The second period scoring outburst was all the Edmonton Oil Kings needed to post the win as they down the Hurricanes 5-1 Tuesday night in Edmonton. That ups the Hurricanes losing streak to six games and puts the team at 32-31-6-0. #yql

8839 2018-03-14 03:27:25 Comedians are taking it up the rear whatever happened to the days when the the price of gas followed the price of oil especially in Sudbury where gas is $0.15 to $0.20 a liter higher than anywhere else

8844 2018-03-14 03:27:02 Steve Kornacki is a damn national treasure, and I implore the Trump Administration to tap him as a source of energy to replace our oil reserves.

8846 2018-03-14 03:26:48 He'll charge $10,000 and only the oil & gas people will be able to afford it!
8847 2018-03-14 03:26:45 No scoring in the 3rd. Pretty impressive Oil King win, 5-1 over Lethbridge.
8848 2018-03-14 03:26:40 Current status: ill-advised frozen shrimp with garlic and olive oil on low heat. Apparently I was supposed to thaw out shrimp.
8849 2018-03-14 03:26:22 @SecretaryZinke Giving away national parks for oil and mineral excavation rather than enabling more people to enjoy the parks is probably not what teddy roosevelt had in mind when the system was created
8850 2018-03-14 03:26:22 I was using witch hazel and coconut oil on my face daily and it made my skin clear up and I very rarely got a pimple, but now that I took a break from it I’ve been breaking out... guess I’ll start back and stop being lazy.

8852 2018-03-14 03:26:15 U know, we could just put the production tax back that Mary Fallin removed 4 Big Oil, we would all B fine, just put it back the way it was!
8853 2018-03-14 03:25:28 I was at oil 260, water 240. And I barely hit Zach, it was a 0x. Baffles me. Tapping Parham's bumper actually cooled it down a little, which amazed me. iRacing is weird as shit some times.

8882 2018-03-14 03:21:15 At the end of the day, the pipeline has no affect on greenhouse gas emissions because the oil will be extracted from the tar sands regardless of whether a pipeline is built. This option allows us to profit so we can invest in non oil alternatives in the near future.

8910 2018-03-14 03:17:47 Him being positioned at Secretary of State gave him real power to fight the Middle East/Arabs for oil production/sales... the idea here was to make U.S competitive globally in the oil industry

8924 2018-03-14 03:15:51 Spill response is a major ongoing issue and more can always be learned about anything, including dilbit. It’s a popular fallacy that dilbit is different than other crude oil.

8950 2018-03-14 03:13:18 Oil and water are both sacred to Jesus. Obama was a muslim, Trump a Christian. So, i still dont inderstand why you are supportive of Obama and not Trump, when Muslim virtues demand they KILL CHRISTIANS AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SEX OUT OF WEDLOCK.

8955 2018-03-14 03:12:52 Alberta keeps all their oil revenue, so they don't need to operate the stores and SK is mostly rural areas where operation costs would outweigh profit increases.  We will all pay for it in other ways so heavy drinkers save a few bucks...

8996 2018-03-14 03:06:41 But you’re lending your considerable credibility and influence to this snake oil conpany. In that, you’re supporting their blatantly unethical practices. On the other hand, you’re now in the position to end those practices by publically disawowing them.

9005 2018-03-14 03:05:45 I am so encouraged and inspired by how the community of educators across our state are coming together. However, our legislators still aren’t taking this seriously. They can fund this by raising taxes on oil and wind. Please call, email, or visit them. #oklaed #thetimeisnow

9026 2018-03-14 03:03:44 You are willing to change the fundamental chemistry of most the air and water on the planet while remaining entirely ignorant of its impact. 

Burning Oil and coal has been beneficial. Now the bill is coming due
9027 2018-03-14 03:03:42 Trying out Sunday Riley UFO oil for the first time tonight. Will report back if I look like a newborn baby when I wake up.
9028 2018-03-14 03:03:31 Wait, using mineral oil for non high voltage stuff? What is this witch craft?
9029 2018-03-14 03:03:29 Yeah, who would of thought it, right? Better to make fortunes on period schemes, robbing people's retirement funds or shedding blood over oil in the middle East. Clearly the world's coming to an end because of this guy.
9030 2018-03-14 03:03:26 My buddy just had me meet his friends who gave me Over 5lbs Of infused goodies and an entire mason jar full of strongly infused coconut oil. They didn’t even want anything for it, just sweet old hippies who like to help people in pain.

9035 2018-03-14 03:03:04 Yeah in a business aspect this is one move he should not have done, soon we will see oil prices rise as well since that’s a high demand for production, zero senses
9036 2018-03-14 03:03:00 All the better to deforest or drill for oil my dear.
9037 2018-03-14 03:02:59 Murphy's law day to Waco, due to an incompetent oil change worker @ Wal-mart! Will address it 2morrow, & lawsuit possible.

9039 2018-03-14 03:02:51 I don't get this. The fact neither Lucic or Kassian are willing to even engage is absolutely absurd.
9040 2018-03-14 03:02:50 Well, today I actually DID buy and put on beard oil, so I'm pretty sure that means it's over for you fuckers

9052 2018-03-14 03:00:32 bad idea; fill it in with shadow until you don’t care about it anymore and apply castor oil or vitamin e oil every night.  b sure to clean it off in the morning
9053 2018-03-14 03:00:24 Your cracks do not disqualify you from your calling. The cracks are how the oil gets out. @stevenfurtick #insideelevation

9055 2018-03-14 03:00:15 Last year on Christmas Eve, Bruce had a little freak accident

We as Mexicans were making carnitas...Bruce and my uncle decided to remove the disco from the fire and dump the oil out
9056 2018-03-14 03:00:01 So many seem to be drinking the kool aid! They’d totally be up for some snake oil—I know just the salesman!
9057 2018-03-14 02:59:52 Same as Oil fans really. Despite how bad it is, we still don’t know if Chiarelli is gone. Only because we can’t trust the the OBC collective to make the correct decision. So their incompetence has created a fan base that cheers for losses.
9058 2018-03-14 02:59:51 No, he will be with the Lucas Oil Series at Atomic and Brownstown.

Geez!!
He needs to remember just WHO owns big oil before he does that.
9061 2018-03-14 02:59:21 wow, he's really going to charge oil rig workers a fee to go to work every day?
9062 2018-03-14 02:59:13 They ship "batches" of Fuels and various grades of oil.The actions you are taking makes businesses not want to build because they have to fight rules by Turdeau and NDP governments.Customers overseas want Bitumen. 1 barrel of Bitumen converts to 1.5 barrels of oil products.

9073 2018-03-14 02:58:24 Yup ... Tillerson (winner of Putin's friendship medal or whatever) gutted State Dept ... which benefited Putin, his oily oligarchs and US & Intl oil cos blocked by sanctions ... Figured he'd return to Exon $.  Still ... gotta admit ... today in Tillerson land's been really weird.
9074 2018-03-14 02:58:19 Somewhat productive day despite getting off work way late. Finished a commission and started sketching out my base drawing for an oil painting for a competition I shouldn't be bothering with. (But Kamelot...)
9075 2018-03-14 02:58:14 Is it setting the water on fire? Or just setting the oil on fire. We must dig deeper!
9076 2018-03-14 02:57:55 I went to sprinkle lavender oil on my pillowcase and ended up spilling the whole bottle on my bed

9085 2018-03-14 02:57:06 What's the deal with the medieval "boil them in oil"? Was a key castle defence inspired by a delicious fries related incident?
9086 2018-03-14 02:56:46 You would think the left would love this since they hate "big oil" and he was CEO of EXXON

9093 2018-03-14 02:56:01 She is talking about financially. Looking back financially. She is referencing urban areas, industrial areas. And yes, Trump did sell himself on a platform of going backwards.... Drilling oil, coal. We need technology, education. The world is going to swallow us in industry.
9094 2018-03-14 02:56:01 Then I’m going bring out the oil to the photo shoot
9095 2018-03-14 02:56:00 I just might do that... you do oil changes too?

9103 2018-03-14 02:55:05 Rest assure that after Aramco’s IPO shows successful, a number of other IPO’s will naturally follow. There then the oil price will suffer the consequences...

9237 2018-03-14 02:37:20 Make that 5-1 Oil Kings
9238 2018-03-14 02:37:05 4-1 Oil Kings in a game the Hurricanes must win.
If not, @tigershockey are Central Division champions for the 2nd straight year. #whl
9239 2018-03-14 02:36:50 Bio oil
9240 2018-03-14 02:36:48 My moisturizers stay pretty consistent. Rose hip oil. Water gel moisturizer. A light sunscreen with a high spf. But cleansers i experiment with cuz i don’t think I’ve found the best one. And they’re pricey
9241 2018-03-14 02:36:47 My Co workers wear dark lip a lot and they uh never eat cuz that'll pull it right off? Like nothing is more funny then watching them eat pizza and then end up with what they call butt hole lip. Where the oil removed it only on the inner part of their lips
9242 2018-03-14 02:36:47 それらの辞書を使いこなすのにそもそも語彙力が必要な気がしています…出てくる無数の緩い結びつきの語群から適切なものが語彙力の前提なしにチョイスできるのか…
9243 2018-03-14 02:36:38 Trey Fix Wolansky makes it 5-1 Oil Kings over the Hurricanes late in the second in Edmonton. Edmonton lighting it up in the second period. #yql
9244 2018-03-14 02:36:24 pagi malam aku letak oil. haha. asal malam je start la gatal.

We have been a peaceful & productive member for 40 years so far. & with oil & gas, wind & sea energy, food & drink, technology, gaming, financial services etc whats not to like?  Go to bed, you have school in the morning. Maybe even a yuppy coffee to grab on the way

9250 2018-03-14 02:35:41 WHY IS THERE PALM OIL IN LITERALLY EVEYTHING THERE ISNT ONE GOOD ASPECT ABOUT IT OR ITS INDUSTRY
9251 2018-03-14 02:35:28 Imagine if they focused that time and energy on the raw sewage dumped into the St.lawrence on several occasions. But hey the fact a drop of oil or whatever could be potentially spilled is absurd. #FoodForThought #energy
9252 2018-03-14 02:35:10 My problem with Obama action (or lack of) is he let those two entities (ND gov and that oil company) break the law about Native land and did nothing about it. Do you think I'm a Democratic loyalist?
9253 2018-03-14 02:34:55 At one point I had to use needle nosed pliers to pop the hood... which I had to a lot because of the oil leak.

9257 2018-03-14 02:34:37 Why doesn't he sue OPEC? Or why doesn't he sue pro immigration lobby, as immigrants have certainly killed people? Overpopulation is probably the worst environments problem, with Nuclear testing a close second. Why the Oil companies, except to kill jobs, and be an ass?
9258 2018-03-14 02:34:36 Oil Kings are 3-for-3 on the power play and now lead the Hurricanes 4-1 in the second period in Edmonton. Conner McDonald and Tomas  Soustal with the goals. Three minutes left in the second. #yql

9269 2018-03-14 02:32:40 Semalem temen cerita kalau dia lagi pake VCO. Terus temen satunya bilang, kalau pake olive oil di muka, setelah 2 jam harus dibilas.

Pantes, beberapa waktu lalu pake terus kaya mateng gitu mukaku seharian, karena ga dibilas-bilas :)))))))

9272 2018-03-14 02:31:49 Oh very much interested - I'll look them up. There's talk of oil prod restrictions in CA for e.g. I work with Alberta quite a bit on their gas production. Supply side policies could be part of the conversation there.

9279 2018-03-14 02:30:50 So. Where do I get Marijuana oil?
9280 2018-03-14 02:30:45 A few weeks after the toppling of the dictatorship, the iraqui oil was sold back in dollars... Funny isn't it?
9281 2018-03-14 02:30:31 IMA's call to Indians for use of one spoon less of sugar, salt & oil everyday is a good health awareness message.

9285 2018-03-14 02:30:16 So the pro pipeline/oil people are typically conservative and like so many other things (guns, what libs want, min wage, etc) they fail to even know what they are arguing. They look at the surface and go no further. Much as correlation doesn’t equal causation, they miss the mark!
9286 2018-03-14 02:30:14 How faded do you think I will be using this cannabis Olive Oil to cook my shrimp tacos

9289 2018-03-14 02:29:48 Alberta’s oil and gas industry isn’t innovative at all. Nope. No innovation here.

9292 2018-03-14 02:29:11 If this was 2004 under Bush the left wing hypocrites playing #RexTillerson as victim today would be celebrating a “big oil fat cat” getting fired.  What a joke @cnn @MSNBC are. 2nd last and last in cable news ratings. #Tillerson
9293 2018-03-14 02:29:02 My dad just called me to find out  if I can get "Marijuana oil"
9294 2018-03-14 02:29:01 Same question: The $54Bn BG deal, made in a “downturn” when dividends were at risk, shows Shell’s renewed commitment to Oil and Gas, how big will you go to show your commitment to renewables? #dollarsorsense #newjoecamel #proveit #dollarsnotwords #makethefuture #comcastofenergy
9295 2018-03-14 02:28:52 Big Oil owns Oklahoma, and look at the shape that state is in, "bankrupt" with all these billionaires living here!
9296 2018-03-14 02:28:36 When you finish the coconut oil, try MCT Oil, which has a higher concentration. Also, butter from Southern European Cows have no cassins. You can buy at Fairway or Wegmans
9297 2018-03-14 02:28:04 Why do I love olive oil but hate olives?
9298 2018-03-14 02:28:04 Technology moves quickly.  There are electrical generation methods available that arent even used as yet.  Scale and cost are one factor.  We are not going to run out of oil.  Its not a dinosaur.   The dinosaurs are much closer to the surface.  Oil is created from something else.
9299 2018-03-14 02:27:47 Hahahahahaha! Maybe I should just make this account a BVS account  

I’m actually not allowed, or I should say, I’m not able to eat chik Fila because I’m allergic to peanuts and they use peanut oil in their frying juice. So. I’ve never had it.

9301 2018-03-14 02:27:30 Of course he welcomes it! He loves money now that he got a taste of his FIRST STEADY PAYCHECK when he won mayor in Vt by 10 votes!  Anything to enhance his status helps his pocketbook. In a couple years if he’s alive, he’ll be doing fish oil infomercials.
9302 2018-03-14 02:27:20 I wasn't talking about Oil Tankers, but now that you mentioned it, Tsunami comes to mind. Meantime back on land Crude Oil Pipelines are doing what Pipelines do in an Earthquake. On the West Coast it's called Risk Assessment, not Paranoia.
9303 2018-03-14 02:27:14 It's not a federal issue a state government decides to do nothing about an oil company breaking federal laws.
9304 2018-03-14 02:27:07 Maybe stop using beef in your oil :)
9305 2018-03-14 02:27:00 sorry so boyfriend and i left the oil kings game. too many kids  you couldnt concentrate cause all you hear are kids shouting, talking, laughing. Haha i cant even  and we couldnt keep our minds off BOA hahaha
9306 2018-03-14 02:26:54 no I just ordered a legit essential oil and used like warm water and mixed it. only my cleanser, mask & moisturizer are from lush! they’re SO helpful in the store though. super worth checking into. my skin has never been better!
9307 2018-03-14 02:26:43 At the oil kings game for the night... bunch of teeners are chanting “referees referees referees”

I’m so confused

9313 2018-03-14 02:25:37 Yup. Shell hired his nonprofit to do an asset mapping survey with the First Nations communities. The goal was to figure out how to best hire/help native populations if/when they started mining the oil sands. They contracted me to do the data analysis, but I never got to go.

9318 2018-03-14 02:25:10 So, Alaska goes from selling $100+ per barrel oil to $0.42 per barrel water ;)
(which one is more important, eh?)
9319 2018-03-14 02:25:09 It's not. How much pollution do oil tankers contribute? Google it. What effects do deficits / debt have on economies vs local jobs and surpluses? Maybe this is the high mark? No. Data clearly states otherwise. Canadian social programs and green aspirations will suffer due to you.

9337 2018-03-14 02:22:46 You’re totally right!!!  Trump had info that putin WANTS to start a global crisis. China wouldn’t mind either. Also to consider: Venezuelan oil & China’s demand. If they can figure out how to cross the Panama Canal, build their own or get around South America, that’ll be a crisis
9338 2018-03-14 02:22:46 I usually do hot coffee with a TSP of Coconut Oil sometimes grass fed butter and I just use a frappe wand to make it nice and frothy.

9356 2018-03-14 02:20:34 Because of the petrodollar. US currency is used to trade oil around the world creating demand for our currency, which creates value (somehow)...
It was a deal struck w/OPEC nations back in Nixon admin, when he took our currency off gold standard, the deal means we do biz for arms
9357 2018-03-14 02:20:31 Depends heavily on your skin type and issues. I have very very very dry skin so I shave, aftershave, then heavy moisturizer, and in the evenings facewash, BHA exfoliant, moisturizer and oil replacer

9379 2018-03-14 02:17:44 This is why people do not trust Democrats.  You conveniently leave out one little detail about solar and wind power.   They both require taxpayer subsidies in order to be financially affordable.  Oil, Natural Gas and Coal do not.

9425 2018-03-14 02:12:50 (2/2) According to the 2011 Living Oceans report, "diluted bitumen may weaken pipelines at a faster rate than conventional oil due to its acidic, sulphuric, abrasive and viscous nature."
9426 2018-03-14 02:12:47 This guy says that the geologist from BOEM says it's not likely that #oil will be discovered offshore which #geologist? @AAPG @API_News
9427 2018-03-14 02:12:32 Look at the oil pipelines at North Dakota. They leak more than rarely. If there is no inspection team from an 2nd party source, they can do whatever they want which they do. I don't want that to happen in other industries.

9430 2018-03-14 02:12:15 (1/2) An ordinary oil pipeline would be bad enough, but since Northern Gateway is proposed to transport bitumen it proposes even greater risk.
9431 2018-03-14 02:12:12 帰ってみます……休憩中に見たら死んでしまう
9432 2018-03-14 02:12:10 Pumping oil at that increased rate means that more tankers will need to navigate through the treacherous waters leading into Kitimat, increasing the risk of an oil spill.

9448 2018-03-14 02:10:32 Not only will this project need to undergo all these tests there must also be world class practices put in place for land oil spill prevention.
9449 2018-03-14 02:10:31 Try massaging it with efficascent oil? That might help

9457 2018-03-14 02:09:54 Stopping local oil production doesn't stop consumption. Demand is met by imports instead. Canada had a 3.2 billion dollar deficit in December. 3 billion on oil imports. Oil tankers deliver that oil.  Your actions don't accomplish your goals = more pollution, debt to foreigners.
9458 2018-03-14 02:09:51 Completely disagree with him. Brent (Forties etc) set price & Saudi took it via BWAVE from 2001 to 1 July 2017. Differentials only directed oil. Price went $80>$147>$35>$80 in 2 yrs while supply/demand varied by 3%. Saudi had no clue what was going on

9469 2018-03-14 02:08:05 The only people allowed in for free are those looking to drill for oil or mine for ore.
9470 2018-03-14 02:07:59 Beautiful yes but I worry it reinforces a message of ban palm oil when we really need the kind of transformation efforts @GAR_Sinarmas has been leading.
9471 2018-03-14 02:07:54 Another advantage to the Gateway Pipeline is the speed and efficiency of transporting and trading the oil. A study about similar pipelines has calculated that pipelines can transport enough crude oil and petroleum products to fill 15,000 tanker truckloads or 4,200 rail cars.
9472 2018-03-14 02:07:49 The problem as I see it is that it makes the stock exchange vulnerable to oil price volatility even at just 4% of the exchange.
9473 2018-03-14 02:07:49 Paying someone to change your oil is like paying someone to wipe your ass 

-Dad 
9474 2018-03-14 02:07:24 ... To drill all along all the coast is making us great? No, it will destroy the environment, sea life & we don't need an oil spill! Look at his Cabinet Sec's, they are all destroying the dept they head.. spending $$ on jets, doors, soundproof room, I could go on.
9475 2018-03-14 02:07:23 Fine, stay out of Rhode Island. But come to Georgia, Rick, where we have people dying every day from overdoses of opiates. Where we have children with life altering epilepsy whose parents have to become felons to get them a non-toxic oil that actually works and does no damage.

9480 2018-03-14 02:06:54 I had such a tough time between olive oil and salt. Butter is right up there, too. All three of them are so essential to my cooking. I grew up around my 100% Italian grandmother, so olive oil was ALWAYS flowing copiously.

9487 2018-03-14 02:05:57 ... oil, might be an answer ... you think ?
9488 2018-03-14 02:05:48 Maybe oil companies should withdraw from interstate commerce with California. Shut down gas, gasoline and product pipelines, stop trunk transport of petroleum products into the state and shut down the refinery to prepare for this legal stupidity
9489 2018-03-14 02:05:31 i usually melt coconut oil down, cover my whole head heavily,  wait an hour or longer, then shower it all out and it leaves my hair super smooth and soft with no weighing down. cost effective and yummy smelling :-)

9506 2018-03-14 02:02:47 1/2 - OMG, seriously? There was absolutely no proof of voter fraud in the last election according the Pew report. You may want to do your research. It's also called an urban myth. So you call decimating our national parks to drill for oil & gas making us great? You call trying...

9508 2018-03-14 02:02:12 That oil in those Siberian reserves was not being extracted in a timely fashion, and with no apparent timetable, Putin’s had to mastermind a change.

9510 2018-03-14 02:01:51 (2/2) As the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development is quoted saying "Canada's government is not ready to handle a major oil spill from a tanker, in part because its emergency response plan is out of date"

9516 2018-03-14 02:01:37 @Allison59798116 Why would Andrea Mitchell say that Iran's in play..
#RachelMaddow Show? Was she implying like Dubya's #Iraqwar for #oil IQ45's will be the distraction from his conspiracy with Kremlin.Its extremely disturbing if true.
9517 2018-03-14 02:01:31 (1/2) If we are to build a pipeline this close to our coastal communities we need a proper marine oil spill response and prevention system in place to protect the coastline.
9518 2018-03-14 02:01:27 I really need to find a new beard oil
9519 2018-03-14 02:01:25 Es muchísimo peor que la convertibilidad para la exportación y producción. No había retenciones ni impuesto cheque ni impuesto al gas oil. 15 puntos menos de impuesto a sobre pbi. Es pésima la competitividad por eso no se exporta. Inviable

9521 2018-03-14 02:01:12 You have to remember who she was working for the Bush/Cheney Administration that was so desperate to justify the war in Iraq they tortured people to get the answers they wanted.  We know now it wasn't for national security but OIL!
9522 2018-03-14 02:01:01 I got my mom special olive oil for Christmas and today she called me screaming because she ran out and wasn’t sure if she could survive without it

9524 2018-03-14 02:00:37 Had a friend post about toothache fixes and another friend suggested swishing a mouthful of coconut oil around for 20 minutes.
I was doubtful but when i tried it for my toothache and it worked i was amazed
I use it every day now
9525 2018-03-14 02:00:32 Yes,Arnold Shwarzenegger is definitely a hollyweird. If he’s looking for oil companies to sue,one of dirtiest is in California & I believe it is near the Hollywood sign. Even much,much worse than Canada’s oil sands,which is one of the best in the world.
9526 2018-03-14 01:59:36 bio oil!!!! i swear by it. when i got into a bat atv accident i had to use it on the scars on my legs, so i would just put it everywhere on my legs and some of my stretch marks went from purple to literally nothing.

9528 2018-03-14 01:58:26 Storing oil on water is expensive, as is pumping operations without generating revenues, and not like they just have unlimited storage capacity domestically.
9529 2018-03-14 01:58:09 Trump just mentioned yesterday how the Intel agencies were working to protect elections from outside influence and he sold the Ukraine missiles about a week a go to defend against Russia. They've also taken some of Russia's oil/gas export business to US hurting their economy.

9545 2018-03-14 01:54:44 I've been using coconut oil to take my eye makeup off and now my eyelashes are noticeably thicker

9550 2018-03-14 01:54:10 HB577 - CBD oil legalization and HB444 - (True) Stand your ground and castle doctrine are both dead for the year unless by some miracle the chairmen in each committee pull them out of their drawer for a hearing...unlikely though. Two bills I'd vote yes on.
9551 2018-03-14 01:54:00 What about kids of politicians who want to bomb poor people to death in middle east or Africa because of oil and power will they be taken away also ?
9552 2018-03-14 01:53:56 Coconut oil
9553 2018-03-14 01:53:42 By selling #GreatSandDunes to an oil company?
You sell out our heritage for cheetolinis favor?
9554 2018-03-14 01:53:38 Yes. - I know but there has to be another way - spray oil wings and wide open hard charcoal fire?
9555 2018-03-14 01:53:35 Clinique night cream for my face and almond oil for my body
9556 2018-03-14 01:53:08 To which the rest of Canada recommends Alberta MPs getting their head out of their asses.

9560 2018-03-14 01:52:29 He must think there is coal or oil there.
9561 2018-03-14 01:52:24 @Airheads quick question, can I buy Airheads bites in a larger unit...saaaaaayyyy. An oil drum?
9562 2018-03-14 01:52:03 I like Smith too. But not against the Oil haha
9563 2018-03-14 01:52:01 Had great reviews  But~It’s cheap plastic, very hard to put together , not a nice circle shape when done. Had to use olive oil to fit them together, wasn’t easy!  Going to buy REAL hula hoops tomorrow .
9564 2018-03-14 01:51:54 Hot olive oil, no shirt, good pain
9565 2018-03-14 01:51:40 The most important fluid - engine oil. Had to divert into Ft. Worth. Got it shut down before catastrophic damage.
9566 2018-03-14 01:51:34 He was inadequate for the position. This is private business. These are civil workers dedicated to the job. He’ll be fine. He’ll go back to his oil job
9567 2018-03-14 01:51:29 i’m really out here eating gluten free, sugar free, oil free banana bread & shit. never thought i’d be “that” person lol

9570 2018-03-14 01:51:03 Just spent 15 minutes walking up & down the canned veggie isle at Albertsons looking for olives. Finally found them 2 isles over by the olive oil........ who tf in their right mind does this to a person
9571 2018-03-14 01:50:45 I wear gloves and goggles when I work with it. It’s a chemical process that includes liye, water, and oil. It takes the proper mixture in time.
9572 2018-03-14 01:50:43 Coating them in olive oil will make the process have less friction.
9573 2018-03-14 01:50:26 Love the tin hat!!....I use one just like it to pour oil in my vehicles! Ha...Good thinking...Tin Lady
9574 2018-03-14 01:50:12 If I wanted the government in my uterus I would fill it with oil and Hispanic voters

9587 2018-03-14 01:48:28 Koch cakes for desserts with edible oil derecks. Mercer mayo for the ham. Adelson has video poker machines in the corner.
9588 2018-03-14 01:48:11 I hate pot. CBD OIL YES....Protein drink are really upsetting my stomach and I’m starving to death but as soon as put in mouth food apetite gone. Even fluids water upsetting but forcing myself
9589 2018-03-14 01:48:09 I smell a huge scam w Aramco listing. No one knows exactly how much oil is under their ground, and the Saudis don't want to disclose it. Why not oh Prince? Not enough oil to offset your 5% listing for $2Tril?
9590 2018-03-14 01:47:59 Hey I suffer from really bad menstrual cramps to the point that I got prescribed narcotic but I’m not a huge fan of them. I started taking Krill  Oil and Primrose Vitamind together once a day and it’s made a difference. You should give it a try 
9591 2018-03-14 01:47:31 Put beard oil on and my beard fucking soft
9592 2018-03-14 01:47:18 @VisitUtah Why would we travel to Utah when you have allowed Zinke to take oil and gas kickbacks to destroy OUR land. Those Fed lands belong to us, not Kochs. Stop running ads and save your state
9593 2018-03-14 01:47:16 jajajajajajajaja bueno callate, este finde t veo en la oil me imagino no???
9594 2018-03-14 01:47:04 I save a nice lil piece of change knowing how to change my own oil.
9595 2018-03-14 01:47:04 Me too. - crispy smokey no oil? I can get smokey - I can get  fully cooked but crispy without oil - challenge
9596 2018-03-14 01:47:04 “I know you just tried coconut oil, so I thought you might like this cocoa butter” is the whitest thing I’ve heard in a long time.
9597 2018-03-14 01:46:53 Not even gone lie people are so against coconut oil but thats exactly what i used lol coconut oil did me right- kerry
9598 2018-03-14 01:46:51 I'm sure May is petrified at the thought of what an ailing dictatorship with an economy smaller than Italy's, reduced to using their rainy day funds thanks to a mixture of the oil price plummeting and their dictator's international missteps, can do in response
9599 2018-03-14 01:46:44 It's really hard to comprehend that Tillerson who was CEO of ExxonMobil allowed himself to be humiliated by a snake oil salesman. Now tillersoned has been coined to mean abrupt firing #Maddow

9601 2018-03-14 01:46:13 There was a line of dudes waiting to oil up Cari’s arms.
9602 2018-03-14 01:46:08 Yes mami, I want to do a lot of stuff to you. But because we dont know each other, Im just going to masturbate with this picture and with some oil, thinking of you. Babe you are the best
9603 2018-03-14 01:46:02 The insanely disgusting break out on my chin is slowly going away day by day. Its smaller now but I can’t wait until it’s just gone for good. Tea tree oil has been a life saver.

9605 2018-03-14 01:45:38 Am I ignorant, but it's potato and vegie oil right?
9606 2018-03-14 01:45:35 Our neighbourhood is fighting a massive new oil pipeline and storage facility. An injunction designed to prevent protest includes a 50 meter buffer zone that encompasses some houses, parks, trails, and major roads.
9607 2018-03-14 01:45:28 Me: [not into horses or painting]

Groupon: 60% off specialized wild horse oil painting classes

Me: Oh shit
9608 2018-03-14 01:45:14 Even Israel with their fancy weaponry can’t defeat Palestinian resistance. Same with Yemen, all of Saudis advanced weapons, Yemen is still on at least one leg. You can argue that all this is for oil & gas which is tied to influence & control but there’s no winner.
9609 2018-03-14 01:44:53 That looks so good. For all of my outdoor stuff, I’ve used the marine varnish. Never tried oil for the outside. Would be very curious though
9610 2018-03-14 01:44:44 baru ini merasakan khasiat minyak karo. what a wonderful oil.
9611 2018-03-14 01:44:40 Canada fucked my family over, in ways that still reverberate to this day. That doesn't mean I don't love my country.  This new tack by the oil lobby of *questioning the loyalty* of people opposed to oil expansion is desperate and stupid. It also makes me want to fight harder.
9612 2018-03-14 01:44:24 Yes.  And increased oil production from the US will drive oil prices down.  The lower the price, the worse for Putin.
9613 2018-03-14 01:44:18 ack! I lost 4K oil.

9616 2018-03-14 01:44:00 Star Wars is kinda bullshit. Like, figure out how to fix your ships, bro. 

If George Lucas made Fast and the Furious it would be a couple guys driving around getting oil changes.

9638 2018-03-14 01:41:33 @maddow @MalcolmNance I think we’re looking at the wrong thing when it comes the Rex. I think it’s misdirection. I think they’re going to lift the sanctions to that oil deal with Rex and Russia. Make them think you’re fired and go back to Exxon. Mission accomplished.
9639 2018-03-14 01:41:33 So.... I'm wondering when @Schwarzenegger is going to start riding a bicycle and denounce his hummer multiple jet flights etc. Had he walked or peddled to America and taken a sailboat here then he'd have some credibility. OK, Denounce the oil.

9644 2018-03-14 01:40:13 Y’all think letting someone do yo oil change that kno how to do it is better than going somewhere?
9645 2018-03-14 01:39:48 Tillerson was picked by Russia to help forge a oil drilling deal, but it got shut down so Rex has just used the office to make more deals/contacts for Exxon.  Gutting the dept as he went.
9646 2018-03-14 01:39:30 Hahahahahahaha...said the same thing. She needs aloe Vera, shea butter and castor oil for that.
9647 2018-03-14 01:39:20 Ruth the Oil cartels are worse then the Mafia.The Petro dollar rules the world economy.There are alot of powerful rich people that have too much to lose.The auto industry is also involved in this conspiracy.They suppress new technologies.
9648 2018-03-14 01:39:12 Sounds like Arnold is bored old and craving the spotlight. Facts are oil products are used in health care to preserve and enhance life. Our lives are better because of oil! #FactsMatter

9652 2018-03-14 01:38:47 The reason Rex Tillerson was fired is so he can go back to Exxon and complete the deal he made with Putin to secure Crimea and export 200 BILLION barrels of oil!  Btw which Donald Trump has a hefty cut of!

9656 2018-03-14 01:38:27 Wait! I thought  #Maddow told us when #Trump hired #Tillerson it was because big oil was in Putin’s pocket? Which is it Rachel? You’re going in circles! 
9657 2018-03-14 01:38:14 Whatever happened to pubes and hash oil?
9658 2018-03-14 01:38:06 Lots of shots, very entertaining first between the Oil Kings and Hurricanes.

vut to be fair, I've done my share
9660 2018-03-14 01:37:09 Boy on everything I love I hate my life right now mf oil change cost $136.96. It cost money to drive nice shit I swear

9662 2018-03-14 01:37:03 Coconut oil works for everything too and it grows your lashes
9663 2018-03-14 01:36:39 They don't want to understand. Americans gas a short memory. The oil embargo. All we need is a steel embargo.
9664 2018-03-14 01:36:25 Got myself one of those essential oil diffusers and it is wonderful
9665 2018-03-14 01:36:20 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
9666 2018-03-14 01:36:19 Nair is also worth looking at, if you don't mind chemicals ^_^ 

Also when I do shave, I do it with coconut oil.
9667 2018-03-14 01:36:12 Does not rule out integrity.  If he has/had it, oil leases would not matter ....
9668 2018-03-14 01:36:08 We just made crispy chicken nuggets in our air fryer using basically no oil. Oh & best of all... the crib doesn’t smell like fried chicken. Praise the lord.
9669 2018-03-14 01:36:06 Burt's Bees peppermint or pomegranate, or flavored Lip Smackers, or chapstick or coconut oil.

9671 2018-03-14 01:35:54 Is my hair the only one that gets hella curl when I soak it in coconut oil?
9672 2018-03-14 01:35:42 How Tillerson got the job:  he was given the Order of Friendship from Putin and negotiated a massive oil deal with Russia/Putin that was on hold due to sanctions.
9673 2018-03-14 01:35:42 Woman used boiling cooking oil to kill her friend after argument, police say

9676 2018-03-14 01:34:44 Well their daddy was: “Winkler-Koch, helped the Nazis complete their third-largest oil refinery.” And “In 1960, Koch wrote: “The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America.”
9677 2018-03-14 01:34:37 I know I can't either but I'm forced to. For some reason got 2 be smells like hair relaxer idk why I thought it was ok to not use castor oil
9678 2018-03-14 01:34:23 僕まだ家でぬくぬくしてる
9679 2018-03-14 01:34:18 Houston TX is one of those places where you have people who work in the oil industry at corporate but don't actually know they work in the oil industry. They sit behind a computer and make decisions that they know absolutely nothing about.

9681 2018-03-14 01:33:36 Really shitty oil based confection that doesn't go moldy?
9682 2018-03-14 01:33:35 A really old couple in Srirampura still collects the seeds, dries them and sells it to an oil mill.
9683 2018-03-14 01:33:25 Coconut oil. Only thing really.
9684 2018-03-14 01:33:15 Omg what hats so expensive it used to be around $4 per gallon here but then the US found a good source of oil
9685 2018-03-14 01:32:52 Yea deffo castor oil. & loool there’s honestly no way I’m going back to closures now it’s too late
9686 2018-03-14 01:32:51 Will he stop using the oil based hair dye and oil based shoes and clothing he wears.
9687 2018-03-14 01:32:49 Sad news. RIP allie, miss george.
9688 2018-03-14 01:32:43 If you want to go to war with Iran and Syria to get their oil, your hired!
9689 2018-03-14 01:32:31 Tillerson, a pro-Russia oil guy, was one of Trump's first picks, and kept the job, despite calling Trump a moron and refusing to deny it, until literally THE DAY AFTER he spoke up about Russian murders, and is immediately replaced by another pro-Russia puppet. "No collusion"...
9690 2018-03-14 01:32:25 Hi ) How much oil boil can a gum boil boil if a gum boil can boil oil? -재현
9691 2018-03-14 01:32:25 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
9692 2018-03-14 01:32:24 The @SteaknShake sauce that goes into the chili 3way is not so good. It’s almost like spicy ketchup oil. 
9693 2018-03-14 01:32:12 Also try witch hazel. It’s good for your skin as well. Use it after you deep clean with your cetaphil. Put it on every night and follow with another face wash that following morning. After that, use coconut oil to moisturize.
9694 2018-03-14 01:32:09 This is not your average HEMP OIL 
#spectreus
9695 2018-03-14 01:32:05 I really forgot the caster oil step I think that's why I'm in this predicament of a frontal ban 
9696 2018-03-14 01:31:59 Girl you’re asking for oil with that angel veil & fix plus lol
9697 2018-03-14 01:31:52 In addition, I think they need to be equipped with oil spores. That way if some one thinks they're fancy and can paracord and scale the wall, no can do. Or should I say, No es bueno...SMH
9698 2018-03-14 01:31:43 Tyler wants geoengineering AND continue to drive up CO2 with more oil and coal burning 

Tyler’s ever so smart
9699 2018-03-14 01:31:36 Why did he pick him to begin with then? Was it all his oil money? His friends of Russia award? Come on. Like all his picks, experience & qualifications don’t matter it’s all about how their money and power can help him.
9700 2018-03-14 01:31:34 my parents buy oil just to let it sit in the tank while my ass freezes off
9701 2018-03-14 01:31:30 悪夢見すぎて
9702 2018-03-14 01:31:17 I won't fumes it up bare but you may find some patches . That's where the caster oil comes in I forgot that step
9703 2018-03-14 01:31:05 Don't worry, oil company employees will be able to enter our national parks without any fees, and take whatever they want on the way out.
9704 2018-03-14 01:31:01 Alaskans own 15,482 shares of GULFPORT ENERGY CORP, worth $266,136. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
9705 2018-03-14 01:30:55 #maddow. Talk about an exercise in futility; Tillerson didn’t even get those oil lease in the melting Arctic. Which IMHO was whole reason he took the job, and tolerated Trump’s abuse. Damn! Sucks to be him 
9706 2018-03-14 01:30:41 Bubble hash and/or edibles turn the trick for me... flower or oil alone doesn’t do it.
9707 2018-03-14 01:30:39 Almond oil has been working on my face for a while but if I can step up to your level of lovely then it’s worth the investment 
9708 2018-03-14 01:30:33 OIL DIFF: 3.95 -> 3.97
9709 2018-03-14 01:30:19 Mysterious, coincidental, "accidental," deniable "disruptions" along several of Russia's oil and gas pipelines.
9710 2018-03-14 01:30:15 Only fools and bots believe a liar. If it were the old west Trumpy the Frog or better #TrumpTheWhoremonger would be in jail for selling snake oil.

9716 2018-03-14 01:29:43 I think tea tree oil just became my new best friend
9717 2018-03-14 01:29:37 Impressive information tbeLwd to Standing Committee today on investment in exploring cleaner tech especially for reducing carbon and methane from oil and gas production- now we need action on deployment #cdnpoli
9718 2018-03-14 01:29:37 Bruh I just got onto my brother about this. He was using coconut oil as a moisturizer for his hair and his face.....it’s deadass still winter here. My guy was walking around with white flakes....I was ashamed.
9719 2018-03-14 01:29:34 Can you imagine if @JustinTrudeau spent as much time on oil pipelines as he has on steel....
9720 2018-03-14 01:29:27 Et tu Brutus? Where, now, is your talk about "common sense", or is it doling peanuts to your constituents in 1 liter of oil and 2lbs of rice bags?
9721 2018-03-14 01:29:25 Its oil! Oil lasts forever
9722 2018-03-14 01:29:12 It does. That's why I have a gallon of sunflower oil in here. smh
9723 2018-03-14 01:29:02 I never knew there would be such a profound philosophy in snacks drenched in oil and preservatives. How funny.
9724 2018-03-14 01:28:54 deep tongue fuck you literally shove my tongue inside your pussy deep as I can constantly doing circles with my fingers on your clit drenched in massage oil
9725 2018-03-14 01:28:50 #keepcanadaworking be farcical, unsuccessful, and a tax grab.....but an election is coming so time to act like they are standing up for our oil patch....hypocrisy
9726 2018-03-14 01:28:46 I promise I'll make up for it with a coyote 12pks Pabst and stone hard liquor, massage oil, and cake.
9727 2018-03-14 01:28:34 He really wants to blow up the Iranian nuclear deal to re-impose sanctions on their oil exports to help boost Russian crude oil export prices.  It has nothing to do with non-compliance, but another make good for Putin. #TrumpRussia #PutinsPuppet
9728 2018-03-14 01:28:22 Yet no love for oil patch workers... spineless!
9729 2018-03-14 01:28:12 2nd example of thinking ahead: offshore drilling.
Seabed equipment, erect a platform, then pump it out for $50 a barrel!
Droop says, "Go ahead, I'll let you drill!" Oil companies answer, "Why, when fracking is cheaper?"

Maybe unrecoverable damage to NC's $3 billion beach tourism
9730 2018-03-14 01:28:12 HA!  Not a coal bringing ship. Just no automatic boiler fuel metering.  Manual fuel metering.  Not enough air, or too much fuel oil.
Don't underestimate Kuznetsov.  VERY capable ship with a seasoned air wing....and it's own ocean going tug boat!
9731 2018-03-14 01:28:11 In the end the military industrial complex earns a lot of $$$ nott to mention the corporations that go in to rebuild infrastructure and charge oil & commodities of said countries I like to call it war for profit
9732 2018-03-14 01:28:02 #keepcanadaworking Rachel Not let and NDP are now trying to position themselves as standing up for Alberta oil industry. When energy east was cancelled she uttered nothing more than a few sympathies. She was against northern gateway. Joe Ceci who lives in Inglewood Calgary a few
9733 2018-03-14 01:27:51 What about oil as well?
9734 2018-03-14 01:27:50 No one will complain about your lack of tan. Flex away.
9735 2018-03-14 01:27:48 Actually folks though hiring Tillerson was due to him being an oil man.
9736 2018-03-14 01:27:42 Try the flaxseed one , olive oil , & coconut my favs 
9737 2018-03-14 01:27:37 Other than your own and other politicians' investments in oil, I can't imagine a reason not to pursue solar power instead of off-shore drilling. If you have to sink wells, why not just build solar panels?   @realDonaldTrump
9738 2018-03-14 01:27:20 It would be better if both teams were competitive. Whenever they play it is pretty much just a beat down by the oil.

9746 2018-03-14 01:26:18 You a bear, or me a bear.  I love the oil industry.
9747 2018-03-14 01:26:13 I use a little oil or a Lot of butter when I fry mine, because I like my pancakes to have that smidge of crunchy crust on the outside. Also, i eat mine with peanut butter so the fried aspect of the pancake tastes amazing with PB & J. 
Or whipped cream & lemon.
9748 2018-03-14 01:26:10 Just can't resist asking if maybe POTUS was on my ex husband, #alexjones' snake oil, "Brain Force" when he spoke of a #spaceforce.  He had to be on something when he said my ex had a wonderful reputation as #charlottesville lawsuit today confirms.

9751 2018-03-14 01:25:43 Trump is truly a snake oil salesman. There is nothing to prevent him from doing something to bring the Federal Reserve Board under his control. It is obvious that he is more beholden to Wall Street than to the American people.
9752 2018-03-14 01:25:41 I’m going to be someone’s oil boy this summer
9753 2018-03-14 01:25:35 Probiotics keeps them healthy is probably why. Dogs literally will try to lick my legs if I have coconut oil on them.
9754 2018-03-14 01:25:34 This makes it hard to know what to believe anymore...after reading a very good article on Snake oil...lt is true Natural therapists are not medically trained. I there are very few doctors that do both, if they do they are very very expensive
9755 2018-03-14 01:25:31 Oil on canvas .
9756 2018-03-14 01:25:26 Let me oil you up
9757 2018-03-14 01:25:13 Kai,Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
9758 2018-03-14 01:25:11 Oil Caps goal!!! In the second period scored by # 5 Garrett Sambrook! 2 - 0!
9759 2018-03-14 01:25:04 The only thing making me happy is oven roasted green beans with olive oil, light garlic powder, and @raleys brand restaurant blend seasoning. That’s the only thing I want to eat. It’s rare when I’m this depressed I only want to eat healthy foods???
9760 2018-03-14 01:24:57 How does it feel to live under Trump? Sort of like...having a meat cleaver jammed in your brain while your fingernails are pulled out one by one as you sit in boiling oil waiting for your eyeballs to be gouged out. That’s on good days.

9765 2018-03-14 01:23:40 Who else but Trump could make America sympathize with a bigwig oil exec who stripped the State Dept. to nothing and received the Russian Order of Friendship award?
9766 2018-03-14 01:23:39 Will the TransMountain Pipeline be Earthquake resistant? Does Kinder Morgan have enough Insurance to pay for the Oil Disaster that will likely be caused by an Earthquake (Disaster)? Strike that, one disaster is 1 too many.

9769 2018-03-14 01:23:16 Ultimately, there is going to be so much animosity against this snake oil salesman Trump that he will not even run for reelection. The nominations of Pompeo and Haspel prove that nothing is going to change.

9775 2018-03-14 01:22:35 It's worse than I thought. Tillerson comes out against Russia for poisoning after Exxon ended oil deal with russia and tillerson is fired via tweet.  Anyone who doesn't see it doesn't want to

9788 2018-03-14 01:21:03 Tillerson was never qualified to be America's top diplomat. He is, however, qualified to be Russia's next Oil Minister.
9789 2018-03-14 01:21:02 I'm sure creamy ones do (way after their date) but oil based I'm doubtful.
9790 2018-03-14 01:21:00 I knew tillerson was gone when the Exxon russia oil deal blew up last week. Be more concerned that tillerson didn't quit like I thought he would. Instead, trump fired him after he outted Russian poisoning the spy then in goodbye speech outted russia again

No, he hires OIL CEO as our SoS and industry insiders known for screwing over the "little people" in favor of big corporate profits. They were protecting the OIL INDUSTRY dinosaur is why.

9812 2018-03-14 01:18:14 I'd even argue to the other side: the one thing Trump could do to help Putin the most is slow down US oil production to raise global prices for his only useful export besides vodka.  Trump is doing the opposite.

9820 2018-03-14 01:17:16 As so it was foretold and preordained by the Fates, in the Year of Our Lord 2018 Rex Tillerson returned at last to a ranch in Texas — where all good God-fearing retired oil executives go to stud and live out the rest of their days in peace. #Rexit #Trump

9825 2018-03-14 01:16:39 I went to a tsunami for dinner and of course had to go through the whole routine of, “i’m a vegan and what are my options”. Luckily most restaurants are so accommodating, so they cooked my meal in oil instead of butter, but then proceeded to give me fried rice with eggs 
9826 2018-03-14 01:16:30 Fuck him. They're trying to sell it off for oil & then charge us to watch.
9827 2018-03-14 01:16:25 Just out of curiosity.....how does the steel industry function without oil and/or gas?
9828 2018-03-14 01:16:15 I asked to get the conventional 3000 mile oil. He charged me for the full synthetic 5000 mile oil. Said he vacuumed and cleaned windows. Didn’t do either. And it was the store manager who did my car. 82 whoppin buckaroos

9841 2018-03-14 01:14:15 They all intersect at oil.
9842 2018-03-14 01:14:13 @powerthefuture , do you understand how ironic it is when you tweet about oil? Oil is terrible for the environment and one of the driving forces of climate change, but we are running out of it at an alarming rate. Oil didn’t work to power the past, and it can’t @powerthefuture
9843 2018-03-14 01:14:10 Love your show fronm north of Canada and the way you handle it. On Crude Helima Croft did not answer your question of  levels. So far the oil market reaction was negative on Rex departure. I do not know who pays her, most of her comments seems to be plane and unrealistic.

I think it'll be fine. Son thinks we'll die shortly. 

Who's right?
9846 2018-03-14 01:14:06 Tillerson is a disgrace to US as a Secretary of State. Look at how Buhari's herdsmen are butchering children and so many other killings, he went to Nigeria instead of condemning Buhari, he ate and dinner with him and left. He likes oil more than human life. It's good you're gone.

9858 2018-03-14 01:11:58 Does it come in beard oil? Because nothing says DUI like your chin smelling like whiskey on the way to work.
9859 2018-03-14 01:11:40 about how U.S. oil production grew more in 2012 than in any year in the history of the domestic industry, which began in 1859
9860 2018-03-14 01:11:33 Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it will pull out of exploration and research joint ventures with Rosneft due to U.S. and European Union sanctions against Russia.

Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said the exit will result in an after-tax loss of $200 million
9861 2018-03-14 01:11:31 I think it just depends on the individual tho. I've used coconut oil on my face for years and it's kept my skin clear and healthy.

9873 2018-03-14 01:10:53 I'm betting he's already made his $$ on oil deal w/ Putin. Better check his food 4 poison & keep his head low. Putin hires sharpshooters.
9874 2018-03-14 01:10:21 I just made my own pesto - oil free! :-) Half a dozen gone over cherry tomatoes, couple of leaves of kale, probably about 10 biggish new leaves of basil and a tablespoonish of nutritional yeast - lovely! :-D

9894 2018-03-14 01:07:37 Might need an oil change
9895 2018-03-14 01:07:35 Then you can make something afterward for you and your son.  14 For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: ‘The large jar of flour will not run out, and the small jar of oil will not run dry until the day Jehovah makes it rain on the surface of the ground.’”
9896 2018-03-14 01:07:21 Like i wont think twice spending $100 in the nail salon but deadass debate if i really need that oil change smh
9897 2018-03-14 01:07:14 Hello. I met you during recent conference in Lucknow of IFRA. I want to have the Lemongrass Oil in build from all over india. Can you support for letting me the sources of farmers ?
9898 2018-03-14 01:07:07 Dude I'm surprised your car is doing okay on the highway lol. When was the last time you topped off your oil? Also, did you ever talk to Casey about those parts so he can get it fixed for you?
9899 2018-03-14 01:07:05 Put tea tree oil and it’ll be gone by tomorrow
9900 2018-03-14 01:07:02 I've bought it online, but they may have it at the pet store or Walmart. You can def find it on amazon if you search 'pet fish oil supplement'. It's not cheap -- probably $15-25 for a bottle, but a bottle will last a long time and the oil is good for the kitty in many ways.
9901 2018-03-14 01:06:57 こっちは最近起きれないんですが………
9902 2018-03-14 01:06:33 Coconut oil just doesn’t do it for me, my hair immediately soaked up right up and it’ll be dry af. I tried olive oil and that’s too heavy . Ima try it with the shake butter and see how it works

9905 2018-03-14 01:05:46 I concur with vaping CBD oil. It has helped spouse immensely at work, an extraordinarily toxic environment that created great anxiety in him.
9906 2018-03-14 01:05:44 ladies if you don’t already , start shaving with coconut oil. you won’t regret it. it leave your skin soft asf.

9908 2018-03-14 01:04:56 I need to get that oil you told me about! I’m gonna add a reminder to stop at Whole Paychecj after work tomorrow 
9909 2018-03-14 01:04:51 No because Ottawa would rather spend the money overseas. It’s an absolute joke that one of the richest oil producers in the world is purchasing abroad at world prices while infighting about pipelines. The safest most environmentally friendly mode of trans at the behest of the US

9916 2018-03-14 01:04:21 I have oil just for the occasion
9917 2018-03-14 01:04:18 DH. I lived on the street during the Getty recession. I watched Klein slow economic recovery with his hack & slash idiocy. I watched 20 years of PC stupidity fail to maintain schools, hospitals, & roads. The work being done now, should have been done when oil was $100/barrel.

9922 2018-03-14 01:04:00 One more question. Is it safe to store your oil in the hood or trunk or garage? I have a few extra quarts for future use.
9923 2018-03-14 01:03:58 Auto zone policy of having one line is the biggest bunch of bullshit. If you want to buy a a gallon of oil you can't go directly to the cashier you have to wait in the parts line to get to the cashier.. Great customer service@autozone
9924 2018-03-14 01:03:50 He has shown his praise for the China leader, I was just saying perhaps he can start looking at China as an example of solar energy expansion.... obviously he won't with his buddies in the oil and coal industries.
9925 2018-03-14 01:03:38 And rightly so. Oil is oversupplied at the prompt, and Brent is just holding on. While other grades are reflecting weakness. Dubai is in contango. Urals trading at a multi-month low.

Have to get rid of corrupted GOP so we have a country run by the people's majority & not the 1% big money interests beholden to big oil, RU oligarchs aka RU mob money, which is legal in Russia, NRA lobbyists etc. & legislation needed to stop the corruption in govt.
9940 2018-03-14 01:01:13 Theres something magical about submerging your habd in 350°f oil and coming out unburned.
9941 2018-03-14 01:01:10 I realized I was addicted to coconut oil when I noticed I was putting it in my hair more than I was using shampoo... #oops
9942 2018-03-14 01:01:04 Every time I think I'm gonna get my oil pumped out, JDF ships my pump to another parish.

9944 2018-03-14 01:00:51 I’m going to start co-washing and deep conditioning every week. I’ll shampoo once a month. But after i was it i put in coconut oil, a leave-in conditioner then pure shea butter in that order
9945 2018-03-14 01:00:13  dang that’s why you gotta mix eucalyptus with something floral. Tea tree might go will with sweet orange oil.

9961 2018-03-14 00:59:22 i hate spray oil
9962 2018-03-14 00:59:17 I have coconut oil bath bombs and they make my skin so soft !
9963 2018-03-14 00:59:13 Actually its an engineering problem.

I am a licensed commercial marine operator and spent nearly a decade working in submarine oil and gas, including marine salvage. My mechanical engineering degree's option was naval architecture.

Does that qualify?
9964 2018-03-14 00:59:09 where is all the cess , tax money and massive savings on oil prices going? even social sector allocations have been cut. indirect taxes are up too. SO WHERE IS the MONEY going. #ModiFails
9965 2018-03-14 00:59:02 The Rosneft oil deal fell apart last week. If you’re wondering why Tillerson is gone.
9966 2018-03-14 00:58:59 Not at all me. ...Quite the opposite is reasonable. Tillerson is connected to world oil & gas. Russia has too much control over gas in EU & so EU cowers to Putin. ...Ever read the weak Merkel & EU responses horrific, invasion of Ukraine? #Minsk If not, read more world #politics
9967 2018-03-14 00:58:49 No matter how much I gripe and complain about the very small amount of sleep I get, I will forever love stockshow season... the fresh shavings hitting ground and the air full of pink oil and revive, but the best part is the adrenaline rush you get when you step foot in the ring.
9968 2018-03-14 00:58:47 aloe vera, vitamin c serum or tamanu oil lol
9969 2018-03-14 00:58:44 Before you go to the dealer, check your owners manual first, in that case you know what other needs to do with your car. If your going to the dealer just for an oil change, they won’t make money, so they need to recommend something. It’s all about profit @cbcmarketplace @CBCNews
9970 2018-03-14 00:58:27 Admittedly coal and oil aren't the answer, but solar and wind power are just not efficient enough. NASA and the US Navy see Nuclear as the best source of power and we must understand why. Nuclear is the best option we have RIGHT NOW.
9971 2018-03-14 00:58:26 U never want them back u only want  oil In exchange for their blood #oil #POTUSTrump
9972 2018-03-14 00:58:19 Where do I find fish oil? Like where would they sell it?
9973 2018-03-14 00:58:16 A carbon tax doesn't just hurt Alberta's oil & gas sector - it also hurts the manufacturing sector in Ontario.

Say, "No!" to the carbon tax. Vote out any politician (regardless of party) who supports it.
9974 2018-03-14 00:58:10 Let's build a wall around California, and put tariffs on the oil you get from the other 49 states. And the water that comes to you.
9975 2018-03-14 00:57:35 I love the smell of tea tree oil, but eucalyptus gives me a headache. In my mind, hell smells just like a Kirkland's.
9976 2018-03-14 00:57:24 a lil bag of garlic in australia costs 15 fuckin dollars

a lil bag of ginger costs 20 fuckin dollars

organic, extra virgin, unrefined, cold pressed coconut oil is $4 n change.

9978 2018-03-14 00:57:13 When they show this to Tory make sure this shit got subtitles this guy looks like a fucking car that ain’t ever had a oil change and has Baja miles. He talked worse then rocky balboa.
9979 2018-03-14 00:57:04 Yeah they shot the price up with the whole oil thing in 2009ish and never brought it back down
9980 2018-03-14 00:57:01 Sit Janko but play Stewart and Hathaway.
We expecting the Oil to dress their alumni?  Because that's the only way the 3/4 lines keep up.

9984 2018-03-14 00:56:36 That's called amnesia and yes you can make oil from it
9985 2018-03-14 00:56:01 Rosneft wasn't renewed.
Exxon cancelled March 1, 2018. Putin didn't get his deal, called Trump to fire him.
Oil oil oil
9986 2018-03-14 00:55:56 Army also doesn't have money, so where is all the money collected by higher taxes, cesses and cheaper oil prices going? #ModiLies
9987 2018-03-14 00:55:42 I can't even pressure my wife to check the oil in her car
9988 2018-03-14 00:55:31 God please let me get a job 
9989 2018-03-14 00:55:30 What is the name of that....  and is that the same stuff they make oil from.
9990 2018-03-14 00:55:20 Im at the oil kings game because i cant watch the oilers right now hahaha
9991 2018-03-14 00:55:15 Just more thinking out loud.
Suppos Putin told Trump to hire RT as SOS to get him out of Exxon.. for some future oil treachery.  

Next..
Putin and Trump are colluding to rule the world and to move to space together... Build the Trump Hotel.. just thinking.... could be a book
9992 2018-03-14 00:55:08 No jobs on a dead planet buddy. Ending oil is survival and our ability to do it a basic mark of human adaption.  You want us to be the Dodo.  Not thanks.
9993 2018-03-14 00:55:05 ポイパック買わないとOIL交換できねぇ〜！
9994 2018-03-14 00:55:00 Here’s my tip: find a good plant based milk! I love almond and hemp! Replace your butter with earth balance spread! Or go without butter. Maybe get coconut oil? Get some rice and some veggies and you’re set! A lot of common foods are already vegan! Dm me anytime for help!
9995 2018-03-14 00:54:40 Imagine how long you could’ve tread if it was oil tho
9996 2018-03-14 00:54:34 Were like you act like you sidestep with the dress on I forget our its English translation my goodness I love Bixby I rub you all over my butt like coconut oil
9997 2018-03-14 00:54:32 Eh hmmm maybe. But no USA oil deals with them + we don’t need their oil!
9998 2018-03-14 00:54:28 I do not want the Pacific Ocean to be polluted either.  So how does Canada then ship their oil?  Where do we ship it from?  If you look at the map above with all of the oil tankers, then do you not agree that shipping is relatively safe?
9999 2018-03-14 00:54:23 Huge shoutout to the sweet young man leaving US cellular that helped me find the oil cap after i was basically in the car looking for it when my mother dropped it in the car after i changed the oil :’) Not all heroes wear caps

10001 2018-03-14 00:54:14 Hot oil treatment and deep conditioning my hair...debating if I wanna wash this out in the am or tonight cause I’m sleepy 
10002 2018-03-14 00:54:12 I’ve lathered too much coconut oil on my body and I’m just... Slipping.
10003 2018-03-14 00:54:04 Hard to remember if it was yesterday when I almost choked on a cod liver oil supplement or this morning.
10004 2018-03-14 00:54:01 Lol yeah tea tree oil smells horrible. Mix your eucalyptus with lavender!
10005 2018-03-14 00:53:52 I put baby oil in my bath to moisturize my skin but I put too much and now I'm slipping all over and trapped in the tub, guess this is my fate
10006 2018-03-14 00:53:41 If he's looking for bright ideas in there, he'll need to wash them off with Dawn like an oil spill duckling with all that kfc&filet-o-fish sludge goin' on.
Let's get real, he's only dedicated to his TeeeVeee screens & going to da' clubs... the conduit of all 'Great' ideas.
10007 2018-03-14 00:53:40 Arnold is ideologically intoxicated. Oil companies do not force humanity to use their commodities. They provide their products in response to market demand. If suitable, alternative materials were available at competitive costs, they would use less petroleum.
10008 2018-03-14 00:53:32 We're fighting for the Canada we want to live in. A country where Indigenous rights are respected. Where our democracy isn't run by corporations. And yes, where there's a few goddamn orca whales. If that means saving some oil in the ground for later, so be it. #StopKM 
10009 2018-03-14 00:53:31 Our clocks change on the 25th of March. So for this week & next my calendar looks a bit weird with respect to afternoon meetings & calls with the US. It was President George W. Bush who made a change that came into force in 2007 (oil related) which put us out of sync.
