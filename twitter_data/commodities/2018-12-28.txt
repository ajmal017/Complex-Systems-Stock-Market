1 2018-12-30 23:46:30 I understand your viewpoint the net effect of the tax is 27% increase. However it is a 72% increase on the natural gas. Unlike other commodities where we have choices there is no way to lower the carbon with any alternative fuel.
2 2018-12-30 23:44:14 Must be building a long position... people forget Charlie lee is a commodities trader... idk how
3 2018-12-30 23:41:17 Yes. We are a mining/commodities dependent economy at core 

The Labor win more of a wildcard. I’m less sanguine than The Kouk.
4 2018-12-30 23:22:59 You have commodity production. Whether or not commodities are there is different discussion.
5 2018-12-30 23:15:40 My brother be in prison, with a TV, no bills to pay, talking on the phone whenever he wants, no job, free food, all these commodities and we out here struggling
6 2018-12-30 22:58:13 The idea with multi-collateral Dai is not to collateralize with random ERC-20 tokens, but instead tokens representing real world assets/commodities
7 2018-12-30 22:43:58 But, yeah, up until about four years ago, I spent 15 years working in finance. Futures contracts mostly. Commodities through the 2000s and now I am getting very interested in certain financials like #bitcoin. It’s a garbage fire but a really good trading tool
8 2018-12-30 22:42:59 How to sleep well with commodities?

I am long a company whose CEO was denounced by Greenpeace.

9 2018-12-30 22:40:02 Yes, if you look at dogs (animals) as commodities instead of live beings with rights to protections.
10 2018-12-30 22:36:30 What part no? That he isn't trying to help kids? That he shouldnt look out for himself first? That the NFL (and frankly every sport) doesn't treat players like straight up commodities to be bought and sold?

13 2018-12-30 22:25:52 There were no food stamps when I was growing up. There was "government commodities" that consisted of a gallon of peanut butter, cheese and cereal. God knows we needed the food, but we didn't need the stigma. I made certain to not need it ever again.

40 2018-12-30 21:51:31 Waxing sentimental for "the good old days" doesn't cut it in a modern economy where globalisation is the order of the day. The govt (previously & now) should have seen how farming & commodities are dwindling sectors of economies in developed countries.
41 2018-12-30 21:36:57 Hmm...Ja man kan ha argumenter for hvorfor oljeprisen skal opp eller ned, men investering har også innslag av tilfeldigheter og flaks. Spesielt når det gjelder commodities som olje og liknende. Å ha en god prosess som gjør at oddsen går litt i ens favør over lang tid er best.
42 2018-12-30 21:30:48 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
43 2018-12-30 21:24:38 The EU do not allow publicly owned commodities. It is a capitalist organisation hell bent on bleeding the working man dry.
44 2018-12-30 21:16:19 Petróleo, Gás e US $. Commodities e moeda cujos preços e valor país algum consegue controlar. São resultados do desempenho da economia global. Governos do PT/MDB tentaram controlar, subsidiando com dinheiro dos pagadores de impostos. Quebraram o país e a Petrobras!!!
45 2018-12-30 21:10:38 I get the theory; what’s the best example of this working in practice in another industry with goods that cost more than $10K on average and are not commodities?
46 2018-12-30 21:07:31 #Breaking | #AlKabeer to AlAhrar: Support for food commodities has been canceled from 2015, and there is currently no support for food commodities, and support is only for fuel
47 2018-12-30 21:03:43 Everything goes in bubbles.
Life is bubble
World is bubble 
Crypto is bubble
equities, commodities, housing prices, bonds all are bubble

If one thing is in a bubble, another one isn't.

Therefore crypto could be great for entries in 2019...
Remember it 
48 2018-12-30 20:46:53 I don't my grandchildren to become commodities or cheap labour in a Tory dystopia or accept what is happening now as "normal". It's my duty to them to do what I can to remove them from power.
49 2018-12-30 20:44:15 We absolutely can do better by not contributing to businesses that use animals as units for profit. When they are just commodities they will never be treated ethically. Choose vegan, not just plant based, as another step towards animal compassion.
50 2018-12-30 20:31:18 Any market. Any auction it’s doesn’t matters all about supply and demand. Forex, equities, commodities, doesn’t matter. Awesome book
51 2018-12-30 20:21:23 Yes, I agree, it is totally incomprehensible to me that people choose to be so cruel. Their thought that other sentient beings are “commodities” beggars belief 
52 2018-12-30 20:15:43 The world's authority on international trade of commodities:  NBC "news."
53 2018-12-30 20:08:47 Mas de quais commodities vc se refere ? Pq acredito que a China, Hong Kong e o Leste Europeu são os que mais importam do Brasil.
54 2018-12-30 20:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
55 2018-12-30 20:02:00 I occasionally see references to a volume apparently published in Vienna in 2010 entitled "Commodities and Traffic Routes Aspects of Supply and Accommodation in the Eastern Mediterranean" but I can't find it on Worldcat or in my university library catalogue. @Byzanzforscher?
56 2018-12-30 19:54:23 Guys invest. Please. In stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate.. etc. just save and invest.
57 2018-12-30 19:52:06 Real revolution that doesn’t remain built on the suffering of others abroad requires a drastic change to the way we live our lives in the imperialist hubs of capital & that’s something we all need to accept and not try to find ways to keep all of our commodities under a red flag
58 2018-12-30 19:50:25 Treating people as commodities and underpaying them. That's one reason
59 2018-12-30 19:46:22 You see it’s not lyk we are interested in politics dzavo but rather lack of basic commodities on the table is causing many Zimbabweans to be politicians,law experts and economists.....situation ikushunda vanhu
60 2018-12-30 19:39:43 You’re making my point for me. Human beings are not commodities. Which is why we shouldn’t let corporations to treat humans as cogs that can easily be replaced by new cogs from cheaper countries. We need Nationalism for higher wages and opportunities
61 2018-12-30 19:36:44 So we should view human beings as commodities and if there are a lot of them they aren't worth as much?
62 2018-12-30 19:22:53 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
63 2018-12-30 19:21:28 2019 will be the year for commodities, a weak year for the dollar $DXY , And when I have conversation with a trader that depends on telegram for his trades and tries to sound as if though he knows what he’s talking about yet doesn’t share anything about his P&L.
64 2018-12-30 19:15:27 well to be more concrete, you could think of advertising and its myriad products and services which are commodities in their own right but also costs of circulation "proper". what do you have when you have a profileration of the production of CoC commodities?
65 2018-12-30 19:07:15 wow a date with a group of hot commodities.. i got the juice 
66 2018-12-30 19:06:15 Commodities are the opium of the people.
67 2018-12-30 19:04:10 oh no I'm aware I just want to think about it as costs of circulation vs productive commodities? some weird ki dof ontological blurring? if that makes sense
68 2018-12-30 18:58:41 yes, fully agree!  there are many signs for this strategy, like trading commodities without using USD etc.
69 2018-12-30 18:54:31 is there any tendency of crisis theory which understands it (in whole or part) as a result of endless deferral of costs of circulation (by positing commodities *within* CoC as the ur-commodity, so to speak)?

71 2018-12-30 18:46:21 Good luck.
Supplement your diet with the likes of Earthlings and Dominion and you'll never go back. Once you see how we impact in others by seeing them as commodities you'll never go back.
72 2018-12-30 18:45:19 Some injures you can play thru others you can’t. Team doctors look out better for players now because protocols have changed to protect these guys long term. They are not commodities. They are people that deserve to live their lives in good health after their career is over.
73 2018-12-30 18:43:14 coffee and laughter are underrated commodities. but what about THOSE ABS THO!!!
74 2018-12-30 18:39:01 You’ll also know when it’s a very rare resource when freely traded on the futures markets like other commodities 
75 2018-12-30 18:34:55 She just got lucky.....like Hillary did when she gave $1,000 to a commodities broker who also got lucky and turned it into $100,000 almost overnight trading cattle futures....
76 2018-12-30 18:23:14 You can’t compete SA n Kigali lead by detector make his country look better on expenses of DRC commodities that not good what that man is doing.
77 2018-12-30 18:23:06 U r talking about a dog. Pets have rights in the society while factory farming animals are seeing as commodities. Animal agriculture has so much $ that even control the laws! Depending on where u r, u can even get 60 years in jail for rescuing factory farming animals #ridiculous
78 2018-12-30 18:21:59 So many Salary increment up to 4 times Provide  GSM network  creation of GSM business  like never  before  Pay up of all accumulated foreign  debt  low Prize  of all  commodities  low hajj  fees  creations  of more  universities apart from  the existing  ones hope you remember
79 2018-12-30 18:20:34 Non capisco: banda e infrastruttura IT sono abbondantemente vendute come commodities ovunque nel mondo, per non parlare di piattaforme IT e Saas. Boh
80 2018-12-30 18:20:07 Excellent piece, Owen. Pretty sure that the Neo-Liberal/Social Darwinism Ideology of seeing people as profit-making commodities (and those people unable to be exploited as, quite literally, 'worthless' in their eyes), has a lot to do with it. A Social Engineering Enterprise.
81 2018-12-30 18:06:57 Regardless of the labor theory of value, Sraffas production of commodities by means of commodities shows how a proper input / output analysis of prices should begin (Marx’s “prices of production)
82 2018-12-30 18:06:26 When a buyer switches supplier of commodities, it's tough to get them back.
You can always start a price war and destroy the market you previously owned.
83 2018-12-30 17:53:40 This why I have questioned our appreciation and understanding of the role of a Stock Exchange in a country. We need not focus mostly on commodities but also on the Stock Exchange as funding mechanism for the private sector through IPOs, and an investment portfolio for the public.
84 2018-12-30 17:53:34 Don’t talk about Haroon Rasheed. These kind of journalists are sellable commodities.
85 2018-12-30 17:52:30 My limited understanding was that Bolivian socialism nonetheless meant large-scale private ownership and management of all the major extractive industries and export commodities like natural gas, zinc, and cocaine.
86 2018-12-30 17:36:52 Even if not in agreement with his analysis of commodities  production and surplus value, his history of economic thought alone (ToSV) is the definitive treatment of classical political economy. 

Take time to read things you feel strongly about? That is the real millennial issue.
87 2018-12-30 17:20:30 Yep.. Back in Nov, $GS came out, declaring bullish for commodities in 2019.  I posted several of their recommendations.
88 2018-12-30 17:14:34 Shared child raising does NOT equal human warehousing. The first is communal and involves deep emotional attachment prior to sharing. The second is industrial, impersonal, and cold, treating humans as commodities.

91 2018-12-30 17:00:39 Bubbles.

Everything goes in bubbles. Crypto, equities, commodities, housing prices, bonds. 

It's just about getting in before the mass does, getting out before the mass does. 

If one thing is in a bubble, another one isn't.

Therefore crypto could be great for entries in 2019.
92 2018-12-30 16:51:53 Todo bien, pero...¿Y Cuántas empresas viven de los subsidios del Estado? El saqueo de los recursos naturales cuánto trabajo produce y cuántos otros inhibe? Minería gratis para las corporaciones extranjeras, exportaciones de commodities sin un $ de valor agregado x m/obra genuina
93 2018-12-30 16:43:08 It is for the people in power.  And at what stage will future refugees be told 'sorry, Ireland's full' ? 
And who will be the 'racist' to make that call ?
Refugees are commodities for some .That tap will never be allowed to be turned off.
under guise of 'compassion'
94 2018-12-30 16:31:08 Obama ramped up ethanol when he came into office shooting corn prices up 12/13$ a bushel. Normally it is at 3.75 range. All the other commodities followed suite expect milk which  plummeted to around $9 hundred weight. In 09 we lost 3 million dollars...
95 2018-12-30 16:24:49 for us to see true potential of crypto. I approach this market purely from a global international perspective. Crypto needs to start to replace commodities as a hedge in short term and a recession will accelerate that. But agree on the 12-18 long horizon before return of ATH.
96 2018-12-30 16:24:14 Tu modelo es recoger los frutos de la capitalización que, aunque incompleta y mediocremente ejecutada, plantó la semilla para aprovechar el histórico y sin precedentes "boom de las commodities". Ahora q eso se acabó tu "modelo" (clientelismo puro) muestra 5 años d déficit fiscal
97 2018-12-30 16:22:40 Agreed! I hear you saying that it can’t be restricted to that time/place only. 

& if we don’t prioritize a place/time to answer the questions you pose, monitor progress, make adjustments, where are we going to do it? Time/place are some of our precious commodities.
98 2018-12-30 16:18:48 Whose dumb idea was this anyways? @fordnation doesn't understand how the commodities market works does he? Its embarrassing that a premier lacks the simple knowledge the Ontario Gov't can't effect oil and gas prices on a free market  economy.. utter foolishness #cdnpoli #onpoli
99 2018-12-30 16:11:48 Alabama & Clemson are a few steps ahead of the field. Still like the 4-team playoff. Should Broncos trade available commodities to stock for 19 & 20
drafts? QB a must!!
100 2018-12-30 16:08:59 If we are compiling a “wish” list, do the Broncos draft need this year, trade available commodities for future choices, and go all in for Tua or Lawrence( if he comes out)?
101 2018-12-30 16:05:43 Bernie you are senile and need to step aside. Give these bums commodities where they have to cook instead of TV dinners or frozen pizza
102 2018-12-30 16:04:43 Kalau compare commodities, gold, petrol apa semua, RIP fresh grad 2018

But yea budak zaman sekarang so pemalas, entitled, spoilt 
103 2018-12-30 16:02:52 ficou em choque pq empatia e compreensão são commodities desvalorizadas pelas pessoas hoje vdd
104 2018-12-30 16:01:01 Que costumbre maldita de ir a ver futuros y commodities como acto reflejo ni bien me levanto. (Aunque no haya un carajo que ver)
105 2018-12-30 15:56:18 @realDonaldTrump can you explain why it appears Russia's commodities Market has taken a sudden upsurge since your inauguration; meanwhile U.S. commodities have tanked? Specifically, Soy, wheat, coal, and oil...exact opposites!?

107 2018-12-30 15:38:16 The indicators are mostly pointing towards a difficult 2019, it's a good job we can go short or long on anything from markets to commodities and currencies. There is always a way to make a profit.
108 2018-12-30 15:38:14 What do you mean...’in’ these commodities?
109 2018-12-30 15:31:42 Actually if you did some real news research you’d find that China has just relented on over 500 commodities and dropped the tariffs. Also they are economy is only growing out 1.5% and they are in a definite crisis. #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp #LiberalismFindACure
110 2018-12-30 15:26:28 Who exactly does not 

That’s another problem with yout short- termist mind set.Everyone is affected by fuel shortage . How do you think commodities and essential needs are transported .

111 2018-12-30 15:20:37 A veces noto que tienen el síndrome  de sentirse el ombligo de la matriz productiva de Argentina, y no lo son. Procesan un commodity para obtener dos commodities, los tres tienen como principal destino la exportación. Dato la crisis actual ya se comió 150.000 puestos de trabajo
112 2018-12-30 15:18:33 @TMobileHelp @JohnLegere Always had some issue with IPhone trade in promo. I am really considering of moving my business elsewhere. 12+ years with TMobile.
113 2018-12-30 15:11:55 Respected sir do you track Agri commodities also?
114 2018-12-30 15:04:20 Role of bitcoin

Global equity, debt, RE, commodities, and their derivatives continue value migration to bitcoin. 

Global pie ~ $500T will shrink as malinvestment flushes to ~ $250T. 

Currently invisible hairline pie slice of btc will achieve 25% in next twenty years ~ $75T.
115 2018-12-30 14:32:20 If one values their commodities in fiat money, then the value of the commodity money fluxuates accordingly.

However commodity money bears with it an intrinsic value, and that may be used *instead* of the fiat value for goods and services. The seller therefore assumes risk.
116 2018-12-30 14:30:51 Oil is different from mining, because its a much more concentrated supply chain. Venezuela always had a problem because of the size of PDVSA relative to the rest of their economy. There are no equivalent to PDVSA on the Chilean economy, that relies on commodities, for instance.
117 2018-12-30 14:29:27 Another connection is the overall systematic oppression of veganism/vegan commodities. A lot of vegan product brands in the name of neoliberalism labeled “fair trade” and “ethical” use the slave labor of poc. Same with produce like bananas, tomatoes, cacao.

121 2018-12-30 14:12:22 I for one, am scared to death of the destruction mr. trump is causing to the legacy left behind for my grand children. The future of these precious commodities is at stake. Every parent/grandparent should be very very concerned.
122 2018-12-30 14:08:22 Speaking with a middle manager who works in a big commodities firm in Jhb. Things are getting bad. BEE employees not able to forecast numbers or trends, lots of white middle managers leaving for other shores. I fear the trend is going to become a flood.
123 2018-12-30 14:07:59 Guess I missed the series of tweets where Pat (or any other non-anarchists) said that the local/state/federal government has zero purpose and can’t use public funds for necessary services and commodities. Source?
124 2018-12-30 14:06:56 I think that paid work could be in supporting families rather than in separating them  and making children into commodities in a market
125 2018-12-30 13:38:50 Because capitalism depends on turning natural resources into commodities on a ever-greater scale, duh
126 2018-12-30 13:37:52 Too bad, its the Rakyat, esp the Felda's 'peneroka' themselves who had been used as the pawn. Whilst the peneroka are suffering from the drop of commodities' value & prices, these PH politicians are washing their hands !
127 2018-12-30 13:36:51 Being an EM investor, should I be more into gold, silver or miners? My currency isn't really tied to any sort of commodities (the PLN)
128 2018-12-30 13:30:41 Si el sp500 baja el DXY cae xq fuerza economica y si el DXY CAE los Commodities SUBEN xq estan valuados en USD. El mkt deberia atinar hacer topping el año que viene conforme al ciclo de Benner.
129 2018-12-30 13:16:53 Also I think your Plan B is too limited. There is a role for Midwest ag commodities producers to play in fighting climate change and getting paid for ecosystem services.
130 2018-12-30 13:06:50 Exatamente, o alvo é a indústria indígena, posteriormente vem as chamadas ONG'S'' seguidas de protecionismo com o objetivo de sensibilizar a nação e se apossam de X alqueires, e surripiam todo o commodities presente. E nós TUPINIQUINS, com o projeto de ensacar VENTO ...
131 2018-12-30 13:04:59 Is it real that teachers are paid 300 RTGS or otherwise because if they really get such amount how are they survive with school fees, uniforms and basic commodities are so high?
132 2018-12-30 12:56:26 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
133 2018-12-30 12:37:55 Allow me to chime in: most news programs have computerized rosters with ppl listed by ‘areas of expertise’. Each show has bookers and often its 20-something assistants who google &call people after they’ve exhausted the roster. Paid experts first then known commodities next /1
134 2018-12-30 12:35:53 No me parece para nada aventurado. Y no veo ningún determinismo en su idea. Sólo una alerta sobre la tendencia a que la tecnología vuelva cada vez más pobre una estrategia de inserción en el mercado basada en commodities sin mayor agregación de valor.
135 2018-12-30 12:08:55 He was a commodities trader so cut from the same cloth. 

You mean uncertainty like dropping out of 60 odd trade deals and moving to WTO rules. I cannot imagine anything the markets would fear more. 

That said, I do think UK economy can withstand it but it could get very rough.
136 2018-12-30 11:47:48 Doesn't matter where you live, animals are treated as commodities; sandwiches and shoes.
We're so far removed from reality that most don't even feel guilty buying animal products.
If you wouldn't pay someone to kill a dog or cat why any other loving being.

Shift your perception.
137 2018-12-30 11:47:07 Y te digo algo. La riqueza no viene porque tengas abundancia de materias primas, sino lo que puedes hacer con ellas. Y Venezuela es un pais pobre, porque dependemos de los commodities y no producimos casi nada, los ingresos se dilapidan en gastos sociales
138 2018-12-30 11:16:24 Nzara meant people were living in abject poverty. The salaries were outmatched by the prices of basic commodities to such an extent that some luxuries were shelved. We had economic meltdowns right from Jan -Dec..Surviving each day became a skill...In short Pfeee settings ndonzara
139 2018-12-30 11:03:00 Zim is down to it's knees. It's purported leader is now on holiday whilst the country is burning. Doctors on strike, no fuel, looming civil servants strike, inflation high, shotages of basic commodities, useless bond note & a rigged election that resulted in killings on 1 August

141 2018-12-30 10:57:52 And many retailers are facing as big a challenge as the arrival of refrigeration was to the ice trade. Online shopping has reduced many products to commodities that can be purchased and returned with no human interaction.

148 2018-12-30 09:47:49 The way football is these days.....coaches can't risk their jobs on unproven commodities....
149 2018-12-30 09:43:27 If we have the right technology for atom/molecular printing we could print any material and any item we could think of.
Therefore in the future far far away money or commodities will have no value.
The only item you could trade is 'information'.
150 2018-12-30 09:29:07 Today petrol is cheaper, vegetables and pulses are cheaper and most of other commodities are also cheaper. Now nobody speaks anything. There is all round progress in the country. No appreciation. What we are actually looking for ?
151 2018-12-30 09:16:16 They need all basic commodities for themselves and their families. Give them mari inoenderana wth their services (wc i know are more valuable than deputy ministers').......
152 2018-12-30 09:09:29 Mr. Faraj, veil is nothing but a tribal practice which has got nothing to do with the religion. If a lady herself wishes to wear Niqab, it’s her free will. You must also remember, it creates a security concern as well. Women aren’t commodities in order to be covered so that none
153 2018-12-30 08:16:01 I hope they add more useful props to make roads, junctions, and other urban traffic commodities to let is connect our bases and actually make player cities 
154 2018-12-30 08:05:14 I'm not so sure. I hope you're right. But robots are going to replace (or deeply wound) radiologists and pathologists within the next 10-15 years. They're going to do the same for accountants and lawyers. A lot of jobs are about to become commodities.
155 2018-12-30 08:05:09 Can someone explain why the Panda is revered in China and remains an animal that is important to Chinese culture, but then they treat other bear species like commodities, turning a blind eye when other bears are exploited for their bile, a popular ingredient in Chinese medicine?
156 2018-12-30 07:39:16 I don’t think anything the LNP or Labour have done in the last 21 years has had any impact on the economy. The economy is strong because of commodities. The LNP penchant to distribute wealth to their corporate supports is why they will lose. Terrorism focus is fear mongering
157 2018-12-30 07:30:03 Net importation of commodities mkuru, the food you have been eating from OK and PnP is imported and with the current scenario of production being minimal or non existent there's little or no exports to reciprocate the importation outlay. So it'll be a no-brainer.....

China drive to exploit cheaper commodities but also to exploit the idea of cheap labor like Brazil and other nations it has lease land for farming is a plan to use others cheap resources Like buying Manhattan for $24
162 2018-12-30 06:25:26 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
163 2018-12-30 06:18:04 It's almost impossible not to talk about players as commodities when discussing trades, but I can try!
164 2018-12-30 05:58:03 #CleanBC The current and past governments have failed to address housing affordability (no long term strategy) and the transportation efficiency of people, goods and commodities (locally, inter-provincially or globally). Hence, daily life GHG emissions will keep growing.  TaxGrab
165 2018-12-30 05:44:23 Welcome back! Haven’t heard anything for a while . Egypt = Islam wothOUT oil = not successful. Sorry to say, but have you ever seen a Muslim country which has success withOUT oil ? Malaysia and Indonesia are trying hard, ok. But they also live off commodities @nathirhussein
166 2018-12-30 05:44:04 Ahhh well I hope you never run a business because clearly you don't understand anything.  Having all the skill in the world means nothing if nobody acknowledges it. The UFC sees their fighters as commodities and nothing more. The fact that they dont promote her more...
167 2018-12-30 05:41:07 Does he hold commodities bets, futures or shorts on soybeans? Or his family? Another investigation needed.

169 2018-12-30 05:00:21 So there will be oil but not enough demand to  justify the very high capital costs necessary to build out and maintain the massive amounts of infrastructure necessary to make it cheap. Commodities only work as commodities at very high volume - that is their very nature.
170 2018-12-30 04:42:30 “The Rock made more money than Emily Blunt! This is sexism.”

No. That’s not how it works. In Hollywood, people are commodities and paychecks are investments. The higher the commodity, the larger the investment. He’s paid more because people will see this movie BECAUSE of him.
171 2018-12-30 04:41:37 You asked a great question. It’s a weaker Canadian dollar (commodities are priced in USD) and an oversupply by the big producers but it won’t last long. The carbon tax will factor in later on DuhWiggy and yes it will be more. The truth is their claim is really unfounded.
172 2018-12-30 04:35:26 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
173 2018-12-30 04:24:01 I think you're right abut brand value in commodities btw.

176 2018-12-30 03:48:58 On the battlefield, you and I are valuable commodities. But back "home", we're nothing but dead weight. 
If we're lucky, we might get the attention of some two-bit journalist from a cheap tabloid. You and I are doomed to remain here until we die like dogs on the battlefield.
177 2018-12-30 03:42:32 Some proven commodities there mate 
178 2018-12-30 03:41:36 OPB4 Most of the ancient writing we have are invoices, commodities, and measurements. So that's what's most important and comes first. We've already mapped the trade routes and waterways. Looked at that way, everything I'm saying can be constructed by using mainstream knowledge
179 2018-12-30 03:38:14 And what is wrong with lining up for essential commodities???

At a time,it happened in China,Singapore,Germany and now in Rwanda....

Most of you guys on this thread are OBTUSE!

181 2018-12-30 03:33:29 The harshest of harsh realities:

The SEC knows ERC20 ICOs are securities because we already taught them that altcoins were commodities before the Ethereum genesis block was hashed.
182 2018-12-30 03:32:45 Quantitative Easing will backfire. US Fed been printing money with no backing of financial assets and commodities. That’s very unconventional.
183 2018-12-30 03:31:03 I advocate eliminating Billionaires with taxation. No human should be able to garner that much wealth. 

Cops, firefighters, and doctors are essentially being paid non-livable wages 2 help  "workers" get to and from their job of producing commodities for Billionaires.
184 2018-12-30 03:18:04 I'm sorry but what is it about soybeans? Why is this so dreadful? Don't we grow other commodities? I live near the "Salad Bowl" of the world. Not a soybean in sight!
185 2018-12-30 03:15:16 I have actual commodities.
186 2018-12-30 03:14:57 In commercial era everything is seen as  publicity stunt whether those are releasing of cinemas or publishing of new Books or any commodities!
Only difference is selective intelligencia!
187 2018-12-30 03:12:58 Pricing transparency works for commodities.  My anterior approach hip replacement by a board certified surgeon isn't a commodity.  Dr. X has privileges at Hospital Y and not Q. I want Dr. X. Hospital Q might offer a cheaper recovery room but that doesn't help me. 1/x
188 2018-12-30 02:57:21 The doctors are just earning $100, due to gedye gedye failure our basic commodities are controlled by black market rates. As we stand the rate is at $1:3,50 bond. How do you expect pipo to leave with such and how do you expect them to offer quality services to your sick child

194 2018-12-30 02:45:17 @HanafyTrading Enjoy reading your insights on commodities.  Have become an avid follower.  Well done, and thanks for the hard work and analysis.
195 2018-12-30 02:40:59 No. No one should be allowed to command a doctor's services to aid in harming themselves.

Healthcare providers are not public commodities to be commanded to violate ethical practices. It's essential that they uphold the highest of ethics.
196 2018-12-30 02:32:34 Yes, perhaps housing should be treated differently to other commodities. Not sure that's the plan though.
197 2018-12-30 02:31:29 It’s about dominance and property. Women are seen as commodities and property. Nobody likes owning intensely used items. I’m not agreeing with the logic in anyway but that’s what they think.

200 2018-12-30 01:55:19 Not everywhere there's inflation. It can not be argued that we have an incompetent president who knows nothing on economy. A good government is one that makes prices of basic commodities, services & utilities affordable to the ordinary people. Simple. Get it @GinevraSMichael?
201 2018-12-30 01:47:42 Something like this might be what crypto needs to become more mainstream. One of the issues they're having is lack of uptake as actual currencies, crypto currencies are investment commodities to a large extent. They should be used to provide real value.
202 2018-12-30 01:34:32 Promised ?! I didn’t hear a promise, I heard a statement I also hear people like you crying with every change that makes America great ... is it because your in fear of losing your government commodities ... or mad you’ve gotta give up your Obama phone for a trump alarm clock ??

205 2018-12-30 01:10:25 thats why Integrity ,honesty and love are rare commodities nowadays
206 2018-12-30 01:10:22 Yo vivo en Uruguay. Creo que ya nadie sabe por qué somos caros acá, supongo que por exportar hasta el carozo de la manzana y no producir otra cosa que commodities de mierda

Women are considered as commodities
208 2018-12-30 01:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
209 2018-12-30 00:59:41 That's cool, I'm telling, as someone who was also in commodities that the US purchase power of soyboys was like 31% of all soybean crop. So no, it won't actually increase domestic production.
210 2018-12-30 00:46:06 Probably because of the Rosneft and San Marino commodities deal while sanctions were in effect
211 2018-12-30 00:43:42 My hope is that some day the buying/selling of dogs, cats etc., will be no more. These are precious creatures, companions, family members. They shouldn't be commodities. Millions are put to death every year. Why do we continue to have to breed more?  #AdoptDontShop
212 2018-12-30 00:36:46 O comércio com a China será de commodities. Somente commodities.

217 2018-12-30 00:17:46 Kids are just commodities now. They are consumerised and exploited , alienated from each other,blamed by those who think they are over protected from life. They do not feel they have any power and their lives are not easier. They are neglected, blamed,hated
218 2018-12-30 00:10:31 He’ll take credit for the money that he saved on unneeded commodities analysts!
219 2018-12-30 00:07:56 Get that Cannon ready. "The Bubble" is getting ready to Burst. It's not Trumps Bubble but he has claimed it. The only thing he's done is added two more years of Hot Air to this Bubble. The only safe bet is gold, silver, oil and commodities..
220 2018-12-30 00:06:34 So what? She has investments in gas coal and oil. Commodities that have been in use since before Moses. Did you know that the US is the only country that has lowered carbon emissions. Talk to those other countries.
221 2018-12-29 23:58:08 I'm sorry, but on what basis is "gold expensive relative to other commodities" ?  Value is always and everywhere subjective, but from the perspective of those who *make* the stuff, (an important perspective)! gold is much cheaper than base metals/oil, etc.
222 2018-12-29 23:51:26 Trump cares nothing about children or people in general for that matter. We are all just commodities to him. Nothing more.
223 2018-12-29 23:47:47 or more broadly wouldnt hierarchies develop between ‘skilled’ and ‘unskilled labour’ as markets would favour commodities that take a lot of skill and scarcity to produce rather than ‘unskilled labour’

233 2018-12-29 22:51:34 We subsidised them for years after the carnage they caused during the war. Many here where rationed whilst commodities where sent there. So let them pay up
234 2018-12-29 22:51:14 I agree Barbara.  I've done international trade for almost 30 years & once a buyer goes to another supplier--especially on raw commodities--it's very difficult to get them back. Financing plays a role in getting them back & US suppliers might have an advantage over Brazil
235 2018-12-29 22:50:55 In local markets too, outside vast corporate deforestation, petite bourgeois farmers are utilising unused forests to grow vegan market commodities.
236 2018-12-29 22:47:09 time will come when robots are so advanced they will be truly spiritual just like us.. some might believe in God..some might fight for the rights due 'moral' sentient beings.. some might fight us.. they'll take bribes..wealth is power.. they'll need to buy commodities 2 make more
237 2018-12-29 22:28:09 Always important to keep in mind, unlike most other commodities and/or goods, housing is so very extremely necessarily secondarily demographically driven. Pricing deficiency is a primer, but demands a standard deviation during wage inflation and historic unemployment levels
238 2018-12-29 22:24:50 They will soon cut dividends. Commodities are in the toilet

246 2018-12-29 23:09:48 It’s sad that boardgames are treated as such disposable commodities, but every now & then a blockbuster lands. Whether seeking artistic credibility, seeking to deliver fun experiences to the masses, or to make financial gain, these rare mega-hit games fulfil all criteria.
247 2018-12-29 23:05:03 3264: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
248 2018-12-29 23:00:26 Los niños y las niñas no son commodities ni objetos pasivos de la caridad, son personas con derechos garantizados en la Convención de los Derechos del Niño. #NecesitamosATodoElMundo
249 2018-12-29 23:00:25 Eligible households will still receive monthly SNAP benefits for  January. Additional federal funds and commodities will not  be provided during the shutdown.
250 2018-12-29 22:56:40 People are commodities to him. Useful, or disposable.
251 2018-12-29 22:51:34 We subsidised them for years after the carnage they caused during the war. Many here where rationed whilst commodities where sent there. So let them pay up
252 2018-12-29 22:51:14 I agree Barbara.  I've done international trade for almost 30 years & once a buyer goes to another supplier--especially on raw commodities--it's very difficult to get them back. Financing plays a role in getting them back & US suppliers might have an advantage over Brazil
253 2018-12-29 22:50:55 In local markets too, outside vast corporate deforestation, petite bourgeois farmers are utilising unused forests to grow vegan market commodities.
254 2018-12-29 22:47:09 time will come when robots are so advanced they will be truly spiritual just like us.. some might believe in God..some might fight for the rights due 'moral' sentient beings.. some might fight us.. they'll take bribes..wealth is power.. they'll need to buy commodities 2 make more
255 2018-12-29 22:28:09 Always important to keep in mind, unlike most other commodities and/or goods, housing is so very extremely necessarily secondarily demographically driven. Pricing deficiency is a primer, but demands a standard deviation during wage inflation and historic unemployment levels
256 2018-12-29 22:24:50 They will soon cut dividends. Commodities are in the toilet
257 2018-12-29 22:17:28 The problem with Mr. Trump he thinks trade deals means selling a house. Selling a house is base on geographical factors trade deals are base on commodities and finished goods. If you bluff on trade deals the other person can get the product from another country.
258 2018-12-29 22:16:48 Most precious commodities of 2018: 

1. Episodes of Narcos Mexico 
2. Avengers infinity war
3. Cannabis seeds
4. Brent Crude Oil
5. Gold and palladium

#NarcosMexico #NetflixChallenge2018
259 2018-12-29 22:13:54 I'm a surgeon, not a commodities sales agent.
260 2018-12-29 22:12:36 The subsidies Trump passed don't effect the farm bill. Commodities are so far up the chain, incredibly far up the chain, you don't feel that
261 2018-12-29 22:06:54 Sorghum got a huge bailout, it was like the best crop to grow? Don’t get me wrong, Trump is a complete piece of trash, but all grain commodities got bailed out
262 2018-12-29 21:55:10 I do trade issues at work, it’s complex system and it’s going to start impacting more than just commodities. I know a company that had to revise their earnings and they’re going to start laying off employees. They’re in transport.
263 2018-12-29 21:54:40 Depends on type of unit and location. When I was in an infantry company on a tiny patrol base, socks, wet wipes, ramen noodles, shaving razors, Advil, tums, and cigars were all hot commodities.
On a larger FOB, where they have internet and get mail, just send an Amazon gift card.
264 2018-12-29 21:49:52 I trade commodities and it's ignorant people like you telling people to squirrel their money away that is harmful. I promise you're not healthy enough to be effected by soybeans
265 2018-12-29 21:45:20 27+29 need to be signed. They are both commodities they will have trouble replacing... especially Lee.
I'd sign 51 and 40 to 2/3 years deals if I could. The C and G postions are big "?" for us.
 I'd try to get assets for 7. Ho-Sang, Bellows, MDC, Wahlstrom. Have to move fwd.
266 2018-12-29 21:44:23 Commodities (food) affect all of us. If we don't have a market to sell the food we grow it immediately affects every single other area. And the subsidies will not help, even 12b. That's for short term loses and we likely lost China permanently.
267 2018-12-29 21:40:33 Driving through California it is obvious how water-intensive crops contribute to water scarcity in the state - wines, oranges, almonds, peaches, cherries, etc. When we import commodities, we export water scarcity. Managing the water footprint of our produce is essential.
268 2018-12-29 21:40:02 Can we not refer to kids as "damaged"? They're not commodities or objects. They are people that are vulnerable and hurting. I say this as a former "damaged" kid - it's really degrading.
269 2018-12-29 21:37:41 They are suppose to be commodities now but I have yet to see the IRS change any rules.
270 2018-12-29 21:31:16 Ask also how Alice Waters as well as vegans made ALL organic and sustainably raised food into ELITE, highly overpriced commodities. Food for working families and poor is being shoved out or is of lower quality, and high priced EVERYTHING is replacing it. Farmers markets no help.
271 2018-12-29 21:28:49 “Poor people think to work for a paycheck. Rich people work for businesses, real estate, and commodities”
272 2018-12-29 21:17:48 No, he's right about the goal. As it is QC imports nearly 70% of its oil reserves from AB & SK so there goes the other half of your theory. 

QC has a long history of extorting $ from Corps. wishing to transit commodities through the province. Ask NB power producers as an example
273 2018-12-29 21:14:05 Commodities and humans are not the same. Some people don’t know the difference. #sad
274 2018-12-29 21:13:01 Ben - out of curiosity do you draw a line in the sand of, say 31st December (for winter croppers), when evaluating crops financially. If so how do you value stored commodities?
There’s always an opportunity cost to grain not sold.
275 2018-12-29 21:07:51 Very good point.  It is why I don’t like people talking about trading Andujar for “prospects”. The Yankees have one of the most valuable commodities in the sport - trading it for hypotheticals would be stupid unless those commodities were being used to grab a young ace...
276 2018-12-29 21:02:07 Y además sería un excelente negocio.

En USA el reciclaje es el negocio del plomo, del vidrio, el cobre, el plástico, el papel. Se da trabajo, se crea riqueza, se bajan los precios de commodities, se limpia el medio-ambiente.

Inconsciencia y subdesarrollo van juntitos.
277 2018-12-29 20:56:28 Many from West often look down on China because they dont appreciate the hardship &process of development, from a v. poor country to current upper middle income status, through trade and industrialisation alone e.g.without cheap or even free commodities & slave labour of colonies
278 2018-12-29 20:51:12 Do Africans tell you which among their departed ancestors sold your departed relatives to slave traders for guns and other commodities?
279 2018-12-29 20:50:20 Interesting answer. How can differentiate between overall deflation from @JeffSnider_AIP eurodollar bank run from your suggestion that this gold-centric? It seems like all commodities are suffering.
280 2018-12-29 20:48:25 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
281 2018-12-29 20:37:25 I’m waiting for it, currently studying the intricacies of how to export commodities the moment it’s done boom. I sha know it won’t be under this current administration they are backward.
282 2018-12-29 20:36:37 Instead of buying medicine and importing fuel and other basic commodities they buy those useless chiefs cars just garner support from them, their primary concern is power and to enrich themselves yet we the majority we suffer day in day out
283 2018-12-29 20:36:18 So what? Either other import nations switch buy to US, or drive up global prices. Soybeans are commodities. Even better we could use the opportunity to incentivize our farmers to grow healthy foods for the domestic market.
284 2018-12-29 20:33:46 Una conchita de cambur. Como son tan mansitos!!!
Ninguna inversión en bolívares puede ser mas rentable que una moneda dura o commodities.   
Sean responsables y hablemos claro a la gente.
285 2018-12-29 20:27:10 Haber sido gobernados por doce años por ladrones que con el precio récord de los commodities nos dejaron en default, sin reservas y con toda la infraestructura deshecha.
286 2018-12-29 20:25:25 The difference, of course, between those players and King is they were proven commodities before missing time. Woodson was DROY, Sanders missed two games his first three years and made a Pro Bowl, and Revis was an All-Pro before he missed a single game.
287 2018-12-29 20:16:30 Another day without W.A.T.E.R at this point in time. Buying water as part of household groceries makes one wonder: Access to basic commodities such as water is supposed to be a constitutional right, Right?
288 2018-12-29 20:02:02 Great thread. In such a winner takes all environment, every day BTC spends at the top of the table makes it harder to knock off the top in the future. Network effects are nearly everywhere (commodities & infrastructure, social networks, etc) but perhaps nowhere moreso than money
289 2018-12-29 19:57:19 Of milk, sugar, salt and rice which was tagged "essential commodities."
290 2018-12-29 19:50:17 To be honest, before "the hero" Babangida overthrew Buhari, the country was in a worst state than it was the civilian government was truncated. Am sure you didn't queue up for "essential commodities" when Buhari was Head of State. That's why you are ranting.
291 2018-12-29 19:42:19 I hope we trade him while his value is still high.  Point guards aren't easy commodities
292 2018-12-29 19:39:31 Love and time are two of the most precious commodities and yet they are two of the most squandered and taken for granted. To give and get each is a gift; protect both at all costs.  #SaturdayThoughts #SaturdayMotivation
293 2018-12-29 19:36:18 A eso súmale que el FA tuvo el mejor contexto internacional de la historia del Uruguay: los precios de los commodities se duplicaron y llovían capitales debido a las bajas tasas de interés en EEUU. Desde 2015 venimos perdiendo 70.000 puestos de trabajo.
294 2018-12-29 19:34:02 Right-shot defensemen in hockey are precious commodities, like left-handed power-hitting catchers, or a copy of "Stadium Events" for NES. I've never fully understood the phenomenon.
295 2018-12-29 19:32:24 Canadian forests have huge potential to sequester carbon. Incentivizing forest industry to do so though carbon valuation can shift harvesting patterns and cause management to balance timber value with carbon value - 2 commodities to manage rather than 1.
296 2018-12-29 19:30:18 Tefel, sos el menos indicado en decir que cosas se deben hacer o no en factores productivos. Cuando tienen mayores excedentes por el precio de los commodities y nunca trasladan algo al trabajador, pero los mismos retornan a su nivel normal y empiezan a lloriquear.
297 2018-12-29 19:27:52 Continuaremos grandes exportadores de commodities, mas nós desenvolveremos, criaremos empregos, divisas, conquistaremos novos mercados e seremos respeitados como país soberano!
298 2018-12-29 19:27:44 If you are happy being skinny, that is probably a self lie too. We’re both just commodities and objects of sex. No man is after you because of your intelligence.
299 2018-12-29 19:18:49 Certainly  not a new trend. Farm bankruptcies are on an upward tick since 2014 when commodities prices bottomed out- including soybeans. But- again- soy prices are up since 2016.
300 2018-12-29 18:56:55 La herencia no pasó y va a tardar muchísimo en normalizarse. Salvo un golpe de suerte como las dos enormes oportunidades que tuvo Argentina. Después de la 2a. GM y con él aluvión de demanda China y la explosión de los commodities , y en las 2 sacamos la bolilla equivocada.
301 2018-12-29 18:54:38 Trading. 

I also have an account with @GT_247 where I can short stocks and other tradable securities such as indices and commodities. GT247 also offer leverage, but that's a double edged sword, use it with care.
302 2018-12-29 18:49:26 Also add:
Price of Pulses
2014.       Rs. 120 to 200 per Kg
2018.         Rs.  60 to 80 per Kg

Price of Sugar
2014.        Rs.40 per Kg
2018.        Rs. 30-35 per Kg
And many more commodities.
303 2018-12-29 18:36:16 #1. Misappropriation of funds in general, forex in particular. months pre-elections State disbursed forex for the purchase of Zanu campaign material(cars, t-shirts etc.) This bled the remnant forex from the system. Effect, shortages of imported commodities.
304 2018-12-29 18:33:32 What Trump the businessman appears not to have realized is that soybeans & wheat are commodities. They are not a unique product like a Tesla. And with commodities once you lost the trust of the customer it is very difficult to get the customer back.
305 2018-12-29 18:24:48 You’ve said this exact thing before. All talk on progress, no specifics and no end to trade war. Meanwhile, China has found other suppliers for commodities like Brazil for soybeans and they will not return to buying from US.
306 2018-12-29 18:22:41 What are the differences besides Bolivia not setting price caps on commodities below the costs of production?
307 2018-12-29 18:18:40 So pray tell what facts are there to back up the claims we will be better off with Brexit, where are the post brexit economic figures, who are we going to be trading with and in what commodities? - Facts please, not feelings, hypothesis or speculation?
308 2018-12-29 17:59:07 No human being needs  to b afforded.human beings will never b commodities.l don't knw y some men pay for love or sex.Its sexist.Many women don't pay for love or sex.
309 2018-12-29 17:57:05 Said by someone who's never read the statistics. There's no way it's just random that I said black young men are commodities and get longer sentences and get paroled later.  It is a profit maker for them. This is beyond the punishment for criminals. Read about it.
310 2018-12-29 17:53:01 HAHAHA anyone can type whatever they want in their profile. This guys -> CEO & #Financial #Trainer, #CyberSec #Professional, #Blockchain, #Bitcoin, #Stocks, #Commodities & #Forex, #Tech, #Investing, #Trading, #Business #Education and doesnt know how shit works.
311 2018-12-29 17:52:36 Don't tell about LAAL KOTHA. If congress do, what they wish. Then what is the problem with BJP.  
Sir, I am a common man. I am deeply effected by my believes on God, commodities price, petrol price, taxation, promotion policy and frequently changing in GST or tax rate.
312 2018-12-29 17:52:26 +1 :) Aunque quizás demasiado oro/commodities para cartera plain vanilla (con la volatilidad que llevan). My take: 5-8% oro; 5-8% commodities, RF algo menos (solo productos l/p y hasta matuirty); más RV.
313 2018-12-29 17:43:35 Hopefully we can see it improve after Oct 21, 2019. Until then what reason is there for confidence? Our Gov has been virtually sabotaging key industries & resource commodities for progressive agendas. He’s selling us out to the UN/IPCC while telling us it’s enriching us.
314 2018-12-29 17:35:11 Pakistanis throw acid in young women's
faces because they want to learn to read. Pakistanis come from an anti women culture and children are their commodities. They have not been civilized like western men.
315 2018-12-29 17:32:48 A community where women are treated as commodities and is never free to go out without hijab, a community where the nun's cry for help after being molested and neither the Govt or religious heads punished the culprits supporting women renaissance. Hindu women are really free.
316 2018-12-29 17:22:55 They are. But it's easier to build a market based economy when you rely on several commodities instead of oil.
317 2018-12-29 17:21:03 And a oil dependent economy is different from a country that happens to export commodities.
318 2018-12-29 17:17:40 Am neither pdp or APC Infact I consider myself apolitical but I can't vote for a man that made life more difficult for me and is promising me more hardship, a man that banned 147 basic commodities including rice and raised petrol from 86# to 142# all these in the first 3 months
319 2018-12-29 17:14:58 Lo recomendable como “ plain vanila “ es 25% inmobiliario, 25% renta variable , 25% renta fija, 25% oro / commodities para una cartera no sofisticada  #assetallocation
320 2018-12-29 17:13:04 get away vanodyeiko macivil servants acho. have u seen the prices of commodities in shops .
321 2018-12-29 17:11:35 They see known commodities when trading for players though. There’s no guessing.
322 2018-12-29 16:57:48 Check to see who benefits. One can make lots of money on commodities if you bet against them selling. See this administration would do something like this, sell out an entire commodity supply chain for gain.  Scandal!
323 2018-12-29 16:57:35 own way. The Pokémon are considered commodities in other regions and the tourists..”
He tilted his head a bit, smirking slightly. “They like to gamble.”
324 2018-12-29 16:55:54 Somebody needs to ask for her CDIB CARD & tribal affiliations card! I have to have one to prove myself... & no I don’t get any $$ or commodities..
325 2018-12-29 16:54:50 You were asked how the paradox is not dissolved in virtue of differing quantities of labor-time socially necessary for those commodities’ reproduction—so what’s the answer, dodger?
326 2018-12-29 16:54:20 Basicamente es jugarse todos los boletos a que los precios de los commodities estén altos conformandose con que la mayoría de la gente cobre 20 mil pesos y viva endeudada. Ese es el modelo uruguayo.
327 2018-12-29 16:40:53 So this is where you fell, 
and I am left to sell - 
The path to Heaven runs through miles of clouded Hell, right to the top. 
Don't look back. 
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check.
328 2018-12-29 16:39:24 Sweetie, I grew up on a farm and now own an oilfield service company. With the market price we get for commodities, (the stuff you eat, fuel you put in your car, clothes on your back) wages are a derivative of market price. White folks expect more and the work is "beneath" them.
329 2018-12-29 16:37:28 Absolutely correct was part of Regime Change policy of USA he forgot only thing that is permanent is USA interest  stooges are  disposable commodities Parvez was dishonest to Pakistan .Couldn’t be trusted where self ruled supreme. Hence must be eliminated at appropriate time??
330 2018-12-29 16:32:02 Industrial commodities are produced in China much cheaper than in US. So, by importing Chinese commodities, we are destroying our industries, job market, Americans well being & jeopardizing our National Security. To be an Industrial Nation is a matter of National Security.
331 2018-12-29 16:31:59 It is appalling. Treating people like commodities.
332 2018-12-29 16:23:25 Between our Bennington house and our Lakewood house we have seven TVs, three 60 inch, one 43 inch and three 40 inch. Every one a *cheap* Vizio and every one works GREAT. I don't believe in paying up for items that are essentially commodities, i.e. TV, desktop computer, etc.
333 2018-12-29 16:14:40 COT reports from the CFTC will not be published during the shutdown of the US federal government according to their website. So far this has delayed the report covering the week to Monday Dec 24. #commodities #forex #bonds #stocks #futures
334 2018-12-29 16:08:18 The more generic or commodified a product or service is, the more an extrinsic reward will be needed, such as frequent flyer miles, bonus points redeemable for gifts, cashback incentives, etc. but these are the domain exclusively of commodities, not innovative brands
335 2018-12-29 15:59:02 He also didn't tell the farmers that voted for him that he was going to flush their commodities down the toilet, they're just trying to earn a living for their work like everyone else.  That said, there were a million other reasons not to vote for him but they did anyhow.
336 2018-12-29 15:54:32 It's probably the end of a 9 year bull run. 
Bitcoin's real test is coming soon.
But exactly like commodities don't rise the day after everything crashes, i don't expect Bitcoin to rise either.
337 2018-12-29 15:49:45 What "services to Higher Education"?
She has systematically gutted Falmouth University of its quality and value, whilst lining her own pocket. She has turned worthwhile educations into expensive commodities. Giving her anything more than a P45 is insulting.
338 2018-12-29 15:37:14 Turning homes into commodities,  'financialisation' distorted our economy, built a new rentier PRS model (also a pension scheme) many are vulnerable to boom and bust cycles with negative equity, with high prices and tighter mortgage rules post crash young people cannot buy homes.
339 2018-12-29 15:34:40 @acosgrove003 cheers to 2019 Andrew, 

please let me know if when you have
30+ min to crush commodities 2020s on our pod
340 2018-12-29 15:34:22 chelji is one of the worlds most finite commodities, we must protec at all costs 
341 2018-12-29 15:28:55 entiendo que sube porque esta relacionado con el Dicom...pero originalmente el Petro no tiene que estar anclado al : 50% el barril de petroleo y el otro 50% a los otros commodities (oro,diamantes etc) ? #29Dic
342 2018-12-29 15:21:54 You don’t talk down to your own Nationals, you don’t ack high and mighty. Using work tweeter take to say Zimbabwean are noisy neighbours of no class. SA has class, has commodities. Nonsense! She needs HEAT!
343 2018-12-29 15:17:19 I don't know,but aren't all commodities controlled and price regulated? DukeWillis put out a video showing that dairy farmers are dumping milk that's produced over the govt limit because they can't sell it. You'd be paying pennies for dairy if this didn't happen. Why the control?
344 2018-12-29 15:13:59 you were pretty quiet from 08-16 bub, so political hackery aside you're also exposed as a hypocrite. 8 hikes since the election-and clearly equities, housing, auto sales, EM and commodities are saying there is an issue.
345 2018-12-29 15:12:17 Again someone needs to point out to you that you don't run the car companies. You barely are able to run your company. You really can't close the border because the impact and lack of commodities coming into the US would have a detrimental impact on food supplies. A brain fart
346 2018-12-29 15:10:05 *commodities...i meant "raw materials"

but see what i'm sayin? you can do business with a black dude or white dude or american or whatever specifically. but ultimately, that dude buys *his* shit from a billion other people.
347 2018-12-29 15:09:06 I am gradually turning loyal to Pick N Pay... they chose to do business when others shut down faking stock-taking or renovations...they maintained reasonably lower prices all the time... tried to release stock of scarce commodities to the public when others were hoarding...etc
348 2018-12-29 15:03:23 Agreed, these kids are sometimes seen as commodities. Some coaches remain human & treat them accordingly & some don't. Has to be a HOLISTIC approach. You see it in our college bball, coaches just using guys/girls and forgetting about the person. The $$ in the US makes it worse.
349 2018-12-29 15:03:21 yes, not the same. but i mean they are both impossible to do completely because no one race (or country) is a primary source of things like the energy and commodities that go into the final product you buy or service you employ.
350 2018-12-29 15:02:49 Traducción: El objetivo es mínimo de la "4" anterior (1,810.10) y el 50% del rango (1,803.85)  que va del 2009-2018. Elliott y W.D. Gann (How to Make Profits In Commodities).
351 2018-12-29 14:52:00 Like all valuable commodities, truth is often counterfeited. 

#SreesanthForTheVictory
352 2018-12-29 14:41:11 Commercial Attaché’s are meant to be playing one of the key role in connecting the export strategies.... But the challenge is: What product, solutions and commodities we have left to export? Also,Pakistan need to create across the economic sectors Value Chain expansion strategies
353 2018-12-29 14:36:08 Humans are naturally drawn to scarcity. We value many scarce goods, both real & artificial. Money is one, yes. But also collectibles, art, commodities, securities, etc...

Now that we’ve invented digital scarcity, why would we *only* have it in money form? Seems unlikely!
354 2018-12-29 14:34:26 The @nhlpa only cares about salaries in my opinion. Fighting to reduce punishment for bad acts shows a clear disregard for safety. The @NHL only cares about marketability & the @NHLPlayerSafety clearly worries about that more than actual punishment. These players are commodities
355 2018-12-29 14:10:32 Every asset class ? FX- commodities- fixed income instruments of which country ? Covering only US market - emerging market or what ?
356 2018-12-29 13:58:54 Yo tengo Azvalor en 10% de cartera. Pienso que puede ser el año de commodities y si suben... lo hacen en ascensor.
357 2018-12-29 13:51:24 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
358 2018-12-29 13:48:50 Vamos mandar commodities pro exterior para (não) honrar os compromissos financeiros dos clubes, depois pegamos novamente o produto acabado, acima dos 30, sem a menor motivação pessoal e ainda por um valor q só vai fazer aumentar as dúvidas nunca sanadas.
359 2018-12-29 13:45:40 E outra, os commodities estavam bem valorizados na época, o que colaborou para uma imagem desse pseudo-crescimento.
360 2018-12-29 13:45:20 Así es fácil, acá el tema es el siguiente: vendieron la pomada de los tiempos mejores con precios de commodities todavía bajos. Esa información se maneja en esas esferas, y mintieron. Queda claro que trump y china manejan la economía mundial, no piñera ni la derecha chilensis
361 2018-12-29 13:42:49 Pak-China trade is not the only bilateral trade attached to under-invoicing nor is the official channel of formal trade the only avenue for wicked activities. Lahore Journal of Economics estimated more than $92.7 billion in losses from 1972 to 2013 for 52 major traded commodities
362 2018-12-29 13:38:51 after holidays better settle palm oil, rubber, coconut n other commodities issue in Msia!
363 2018-12-29 13:08:36 To regain the lost market share for commodities whose supply is not geographically limited, the US is going to make concessions that will have us wishing for something like a TPP or NAFTA kinda deal.
364 2018-12-29 13:05:04 3182: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
365 2018-12-29 13:01:44 [extreme adorno voice] gifs are the late capitalist subject’s mask. they protect him from vulgar sincerity, and from the horrifying realization that even what is ostensibly most private, his inner thoughts and feelings, are merely the end result of the production of commodities.
366 2018-12-29 12:57:23 The best  line was in the end. When the billionaire changes his mind they won’t necessarily hold a news conference. The important questions journalists never ask is A) why are you in treasury or cash or commodities NOW? And B) what event will make you change your mind
367 2018-12-29 12:51:21 Dear Ajisafe, if Nigerian economy was bad under Shagari, it became 'badder' and even 'baddest' under Major General Buhari as we had to queue for milk and sugar. Ask your mom and dad, or history, to tell you about "essential commodities"
368 2018-12-29 12:48:59 A price hike of well over 500% for the most basic of commodities is not market dynamics honey. It’s cheating.
369 2018-12-29 12:21:37 Whoa! The UK abandoned the Gold standard in 1931. The Huge Mistake is what powers the city of London, money isn't created by printing. 
Currency trading is a tiny part of what the city does, compared to commodities, insurance, investment...
370 2018-12-29 12:05:03 3205: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
371 2018-12-29 12:01:26 It's not. Communists believe we should deign labour with what it creates but also give people what we need. So if you create 30 tables in a days work you should be able to buy as much as that is worth in other commodities, like food. But if you have 5 kids at home you should 1/2
372 2018-12-29 11:59:56 Interesting! what’s the prize difference that leads to other commodities being smuggled
373 2018-12-29 11:56:12 Of course they do, it's called hedging your bets,  even if they lose they win. Hence we got Gramm-Leach-Billy,  Commodities Futures modernization act, NAFTA,  CTPA etc.  And no card check when dems won the House, Senate, and  White House.
374 2018-12-29 11:52:05 You don't tell them anything of the kind: you deliver services instead of commodities, and the means to pay for them. They don't need to know how the sausage is made: but it needs to be visibly a better sausage & non-toxic when eaten
375 2018-12-29 11:48:03 The introduction of the telescope in 1608 allowed traders to observe ships entering Dutch ports carrying commodities, and calculate the size of the ship’s cargo.
376 2018-12-29 11:45:35 Money is the circulation of commodities. Capitalism is money as a commodity itself.
377 2018-12-29 11:39:46 No manager is bigger than the club either which he thought he was... football's moved on... players are the commodities... Pogba is worth more to utd on and off the pitch than Jose ever will...
378 2018-12-29 11:35:18 As an individual #investor, your best advantage is time. You have time to wait for a distressed investor to sell cheap shares, time for your thesis to play out, and time to sell at the perfect moment. No better space for this than #Commodities specifically #uranium
379 2018-12-29 11:29:05  Keep up the good work. Ignore the fud/trolls/haters. They know very little and cant see the whole entire crypto market, stocks, commodities the Aud also had a bad year. Not just $powr lol. We are in Brisbane ready and waiting for you to succeed!
380 2018-12-29 11:26:37 Add to that the fact that Eurodollar loans & commodity swaps had to be unwound. T-Bills were sold for dollars necessary to repay Eurodollar loans while commodities spiked as hocked inventory was replaced. Outcome was a swap of T-Bills in US for inventory in China
381 2018-12-29 11:25:19 Unless you meant you want to get into commodities trading.
382 2018-12-29 11:16:00 Sequía, país fundido, precio de commodities, sin energía, situación internacional, Trump, Brasil! Peor no se podía y llegamos hasta acá! Ahora mejora el campo! Exportamos energía! Mejora la situación internacional! Se despierta Brasil! Vamooooooos!!!

386 2018-12-29 10:45:43 There's much much much more to life than shitty commodities. Buying presents for ppl & not even knowing them well enough to know what to get them feels so off
387 2018-12-29 10:39:49 Dangote is calling for dangote commodities boi_cut and will surely get that as he started being partisant, and even economy killing party for that matter
388 2018-12-29 10:39:47 Looking at the way we are comfortable in competing in an industry where we should be dominating, to me it is pathetic.  Look around you, how many shops sell the same commodities? And which shop sells more? There's a story there. #StoriesSales #Branding #KoopaBrands
389 2018-12-29 10:36:40 Train law should be  reviewed since poor becomes poorer because of the sudden increase of commodities in the market. Even if there is a tax exemption of employess with less than the anual salary of 250k. We have to know the statistic that poor sec.outnumbered the working class.
390 2018-12-29 10:31:29 Any amateur buying commodities is probably heading for disaster.
391 2018-12-29 10:16:16 @realDonaldTrump Utlilize funds in the same way USDA undertakes in-kind swaps with private parties to the tune of millions of dollars woth of commodities and services. Involves swapping the proceeds of the com. paper sales for the wall, with constr. co. being the counter parties
392 2018-12-29 10:14:05 viva o Brasil das Commodities.
393 2018-12-29 10:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
394 2018-12-29 10:03:04 Tariffman, FYI these countries provide the US with food like fruit, vegetables, sugar, shrimp, coffee, flowers, clothing, raw materials & other commodities. Unfortunately, El Salvador is 100% dependent on the Fed and USD as they have adopted the USD as their national currency.
395 2018-12-29 09:59:12 2018.. weed and Avocado are most sought out commodities in Kenya
396 2018-12-29 09:47:11 The rotten heart of a system that turns shelter into commodities for financial speculation is the real problem, facilitated by MPs many of whom profit from this personally, and manage a debt-ridden economy kept on life support by rising house prices @LuckyHeronSay #HouseHunters
397 2018-12-29 09:42:52 Gov borrowed a lot of money, and politicians transfered their non performing loans to the taxpayers (Zamco scandal). Thatis impeding us from dollarizing making commodities such as fuel subsidized by gov and consequently balooning our expenditure
398 2018-12-29 09:37:27 Vaseline is one of the necessary commodities in this period.
399 2018-12-29 09:13:49 The duo of amnesia + delusion.
I saw my mum line up for essential commodities in 1984 because of this clown's actions. Imagine my shock when some tried to rewrite history by saying his first coming was a blessing. Blessing ba wo? I ran out in the streets after Dogonyaro's soeech
400 2018-12-29 09:01:57 Yeah I have. Have you asked the cows if they dreamed of a life of slavery and seperation from their babies?  Do you know how they feel? No is my guess because you see them as commodities and not sentient beings. Of course they feel a bond with their children as all mammals do.
401 2018-12-29 08:57:45 Only commodities trading timings changed.
402 2018-12-29 08:52:44 Yashwant Ji, it's a waste to explain these bigots & hypocrites of highest order. They are commodities who surender themselves for sale with a price tag & Break India forces are just using them to create a false narrative, nothing much will come out.
403 2018-12-29 08:40:33 So ED is on leave. What exactly is he resting from? What has he achieved since grabbing power from RG?
1. Fuel queues?
2. Cash shortages?
3. Mega deals?
4. Corruption?
5. Basic commodities shortages?
6. Unleashing varakashi?
7. Globetrotting?
8. Telling dry unamusing jokes?
404 2018-12-29 08:29:45 Zimbabweans are forgetting the real cause of our problems. Fuel shortages, Doctors strike, cash crisis, basic commodities crisis among others are not the issues. We have a problem of political legitimacy. Let winners lead @nelsonchamisa
405 2018-12-29 08:18:32 Isn't it funny how many of them are 'traders', 'into commodities', 'ASX trader', do you think that's like Andrew "James Bond" Broad? Wishful thinking.
406 2018-12-29 08:09:30 Thats like saying There will be only Gold no silver no aluminum no facebook no commodities no real estate...
We are going into a new age...Ai and the vitual world will need everything that we have in the real world
407 2018-12-29 07:59:54 There is no confusion. They all are B....... of highest order. Since shops have been opened in different markets of different commodities by them, people tend to believe that they all have different cause. Their common objectives are حرام خوری و حرامزدگی
408 2018-12-29 07:52:37 The intolerant bigot is still you. 
You seem to have a problem with c words, charity being one of them. 
I'm offended by you suggesting people be treated as commodities, with their value measured in dollars. 
You're offended by a swear word.
409 2018-12-29 07:39:17 today's commodities:

411 2018-12-29 07:32:38 I see, the corporation that enlists brainwashed people who've worshipped a flag since kindergarten to protect opioid fields, oil fields, and other precious commodities while dumping them off like some trash in the street once they've sacrificed their limbs? That army? Cool beans.
412 2018-12-29 07:26:58 if commodities pricing is fixed by jse and international trading where farmers is helped by their gov then its not a free market system.

414 2018-12-29 07:15:24 And I think the solution to this is not to complain about the secondary market, but to tighten up security. Those keys are valuable commodities and should be protected as such.
415 2018-12-29 07:06:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

Where are we going is ED building or distroying
417 2018-12-29 06:57:37 Please don't get penic against inflation of commodities .Mr imran khan pm of Pakistan  is stabilising the govt as well as the all department it will take some time after that our country become powerful inshallah
418 2018-12-29 06:55:54 No economic crisis, says Imran--DawnNews
                   DESPITE
Economy in ruins
Forex & Stocks witnessed free fall
Unprecedented devaluation
Acute shortage of gas
Factories closing
Transport standstill 
Chronic unemployment
High inflation
Commodities prices shooting sky-high
419 2018-12-29 06:34:59 We had the strongest currency & our import to export ratio was almost 3:1, eg when the rand lost its value, everyone ran to SA to go buy some basic commodities & most of that currency wasn’t recovered, another factor is import of vehicles, bribes at the borders instead of duty
420 2018-12-29 06:27:52 @Brilafm889 Dis is meant to be a season of love and giving but some wayo business persons will see it as a period to exploit innocent citizens with commodities price increases. I feel so sad about dis.. Oge pls sammer #YellowCard to all traders who engage in dis inhuman act abeg
421 2018-12-29 06:18:09 The Congress legacy of indirect tax was a 31% tax.  We transiently put them in the 28% slab.  As the revenues kept increasing, NDA started bringing down the rates.  Most of the commodities have seen tax reduced. #GstTransformsBharat
422 2018-12-29 06:18:01 He is all that and more. Sir, I remember my parents talking about massive embezzlement during his tenure. Outrageous increment in price of commodities, naira first lost her value then.
423 2018-12-29 06:16:35 How much was recovered from the arrests? These are guys with small amounts. The only commodities selling at 1:1 are fuel and airtime.
424 2018-12-29 06:01:00 A big modern problem is credentialism. Businesses could develop their own people, but because of credentialism, they expect them to be available as immediately deployable commodities available from a market place.
425 2018-12-29 05:56:04 Nifty commodities, Nifty liq 15.
426 2018-12-29 05:46:52 Silver is a bit of a hybrid.  I think silver goes through the roof long term (along with gold) when "money" itself comes into question.  But before that happens, I think commodities come under pressure with silver included.  for the reasons you point out above.
427 2018-12-29 05:40:01 Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation.

428 2018-12-29 05:34:23 It's done wonders for the bankers and control of the world!  You & I, we don't matter to them.  We are merely commodities in their eyes.  I'm not worried about all that anymore.  Their day will come! 
429 2018-12-29 05:32:29 Yes, which is why I'm surprised it brought you food. The staff often likes the robot bringing low tip commodities and prefers to take food themselves to get tips. Low dollar order?
430 2018-12-29 05:15:49 Some ladies are the most cheapest commodities in the market right now this festive season. Ordinary Benz pics fiam brezz inna dah mouth 
431 2018-12-29 05:11:53 If it were in a  sane clime, Dangote Cement and other commodities would have experienced a serious drop in demand for fraternising with this LIFELESS MAN whose policies killed so many businesses
432 2018-12-29 05:07:06 uhhhh well Up To My Basic Knowledge it's like a hotel except it may or may not offer all the commodities of a hotel and hhhh i Think you can like. ok so u tell them how long u plan on staying and instead of paying separately for everything you pay it all at once I Think.
433 2018-12-29 04:50:02 So MAGA is a Nation? America stands against maga and your trump. If the border is closed Americas that send commodities there will be hurt by billions. You might not think it will hurt you but in the long run it will hurt us all.
434 2018-12-29 04:49:13 Same here, Senator.  But, back in 1965 there were 'government commodities'.  Canned peanut butter, 5 lb blocks of cheese, powdered milk, canned meat, etc. I didn't become a Senator....but was a 911 Dispatcher for 29 yrs...that's "public service". 
435 2018-12-29 04:48:18 He's never been popular in my MI county (Genesee, same one that Flint's in). @onetoughnerd didn't seem to understand or didn't care that people are not commodities. A good governor doesn't make choices w/o considering the outcome on 100s, 1000s or millions.
436 2018-12-29 04:48:16 Most branded consumer commodities: soap, toothpaste, shampoo, etc. $PG and Unilever among others are built around this structure.
437 2018-12-29 04:47:15 My experience working with Mexicans is they're ingenius, hard working, excellent networkers, thick as thieves.  Fear is: Is they will take away your money or more specifically your ability to trade.  Question is: Is hard working & ingenius commodities US needs? Hell ya!
438 2018-12-29 04:30:11 The prices of all commodities have been  Consistently low  because  'Congress Middle Men' have been pushed out and Congress  people want the Farmers to Agitate and the Farmers are knave they don't know  who is Funding this entire drive against Modi.

Educate & AWAKEN 
439 2018-12-29 04:18:29 CONgress&Anti Modi groups are propagating fake that commodities price are hiked due to GST.
But the same idiots are saying that if petrol comes under GST slab petrol price will be reduced more.
This is the confession of CONgis.
We should tear the congis face
#GSTTransformsBharat
440 2018-12-29 04:17:35 The Big Battery and Sanjeev Gupta's huge investment in renewables project and expansion of the Whyalla steel works If this comes off there won't be any excuse for the lazy export of raw commodities eg iron, aluminium etc
441 2018-12-29 04:11:11 GST has replaced around 500 direct and indirect taxes like VAT, Service Tax, Octroi etc. 

Different states could levy their own taxes, which used to affect the prices of commodities
Now, single tax exists, making the price of a commodity same across India.

 #GSTTransformsBharat
442 2018-12-29 04:03:19 Right now in Sudan, an uncountable number of protesters are being tear gassed, arrested and killed for protesting for basic commodities like affordable bread prices. This is happening right now. In 2018. Stay woke.
443 2018-12-29 04:02:53 I read first about GST when ex president Shri Pranab Mukherjee was finance Minister in 1990s
Neither BJP nor Vajpayee has carried the torch. But our economic commitments required it.
Lots of essential commodities are costly and scarce in India  are exported under #commitment
444 2018-12-29 03:30:32 I don't disagree.  My complaint is with the inherent imbalance in the free enterprise system that has to be supported by broad socialism rather that making the statement that people are more than just disposable commodities.
445 2018-12-29 03:10:44 No one is discussing the biggest problem of all which is after 10 years of central banker intervention in an attempt to stimulate growth and inflation we end up with commodities in free fall, long rates falling to flatten/invert the yield curve, & an FOMC worried about #inflation
446 2018-12-29 02:53:38 Our  economic planners, senior civil servants & Ministers should have seen this (the danger of an economy & govt revenues reliant on commodities) coming a long time ago. A modern economy is driven by services, manufacturing, trade & domestic consumption.
447 2018-12-29 02:31:57 Happy about that are we?  Commodities bounce.......its just what they do.  Your joy in it suggests you are reprehensible.
448 2018-12-29 02:30:03 The bodies and secretions of animals have no place on the table. It's 2018, animals are not commodities. Watch Dominion online.
449 2018-12-29 02:20:07 Suggestion to @PMOIndia @arunjaitley  nullify 'essential commodities act'

Tomatoes #potatoes & #Onions etc. aren't nations food security crops. But, consumer preference choice

Allow farmer to profit occasionally when prices rise, they wouldn't suffer as much when prices crash
450 2018-12-29 02:11:34 #GSTTransformsBharat
GST rate rationalisation - BJP were faced with a situation with large no. of commodities being taxed heavily in pre-GST regime. Congress legacy of indirect tax was 31% tax. BJP transiently put them in 28% slab. Revenues kept increasing, rates brought down.
451 2018-12-29 02:11:27 GST has reduced the burden of tax from middle class as more than 90% commodities are in 18% slab which was not the case before this tax reform.

#GSTTransformsBharat
452 2018-12-29 02:10:48 Tax burden will reduce due to seamless credit and prices of commodities and services  will reduce eventually #GstTransformsBharat
453 2018-12-29 01:52:11 Did they pay the billions in damage thry caused or were they made to hand over every dime of profit they made when they were scamming the country. Did they repay the people who lost their homes or repay the money they made jacking up the prices of commodities
454 2018-12-29 01:49:46 @WhitlockJason @marcelluswiley those athletes are such commodities that your entire show only works if you talk about them bc people continuosly want to see/hear about them....yet you (Whitlock) demean them. You are disgraceful. Shout outs to @KingJames and economic empowerment
455 2018-12-29 01:41:35 There’s a secondary market for physical commodities. Don’t think people check for source of origin when buying.
456 2018-12-29 01:38:47 Who has time, and who cares for animals? They perceive they have no heart or sensibility to feel pains because they are animals, wild; commodities to eat, hunt, clothing and whatnot. They know not they are gone wild and insensitive!
457 2018-12-29 01:25:59 El argumento de los liberalotes q es con libre mercado (ej: en la convertibilidad) el pbi crecia al 6% anual, claramente en otras industrias, servicios, commodities etc
458 2018-12-29 01:22:37 They found their greatest policy successes because we had a dem president who insisted "the era of big Government is over" as a result we got Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, and welfare "reform".

461 2018-12-29 00:52:52 The situation is so complicated. There’s no cash, no foreign money, there’s inflation and a shortage of basic commodities. Only way to avoid it is to do exports but there are limitations to that too and maybe E-Commerce using an offshore account and keeping your money there.
462 2018-12-29 00:33:11 I'm telling you they're all the same. If you don't have money, you're done for!

They're now commodities like Gucci bags you can't buy without having your cash at hand my brother
463 2018-12-29 00:31:44 and given that, commodities are appear cheap as well...
464 2018-12-29 00:31:16 Syria was always about Pipelines from Gulf Oil & Gas Fields to Mediterranean to profit the sunni sheiks & their Commodities Traders,Speculators & Hedge Funds ,so at least the destruction may even end
465 2018-12-29 00:27:02 What I can't figure out is we all expect Harris and Biden to be strong candidates, yet they don't generate an endless conversation. Is it because we feel like they're known commodities and less worthy of debate?
466 2018-12-29 00:21:07 Todos - TODOS - os Países cuidam de seus interesses, caso não saiba.

Todos - TODOS- os países protegem seu mercado com sobretaxas, caso não saiba.

TODOS.

Se valer a pena (SE VALER A PENA), como dito em meu post, é melhor vender manufaturas e commodities do que só commodities.
467 2018-12-28 23:55:06 Because they like the commodities available.
468 2018-12-28 23:47:06 My instinct here has always been that 1) China was oversold and now it's adjusting AND there's signs there's some stimulus to be had but that 2) The underlying weakness of China this year is being picked up as a negative via commodities markets, eurozone and other EMs.
469 2018-12-28 23:43:46 Of course inflation is always a monetary factor. Right now data proves Div's point. The data that's used. i think there is now a practical set that isn't measured. Huge part of the change is the global nature of it all vs. Volcker's time, in commodities and finance.
470 2018-12-28 23:43:17 Why would they come here to be treated like disposable commodities, when 27 of our neighbours treat them like human beings ?
471 2018-12-28 23:43:10 Rising rates strengthen the dollar relative to other currencies, and make commodities cheaper. Trade war fears will weaken the dollar relative to others. If we can’t raise rates now, to just 2.5%, ten years into a recovery w historically low unemployment, when can we?
472 2018-12-28 23:42:37 We need a better way of classifying divisions of races for our TBs vs today’s claiming races.  Even if it means, just at least, increasing the base claiming prices to more than chump change, which relegates our athletes to lower class commodities

512 2018-12-28 22:04:56 You know they want to keep that border weakened since it's the easiest way for them to get their raw drugs, children, and other commodities which are illegal on our books. They are unethical. @SenSchumer may as well, & maybe the law will go lighter sentence, but he must do jail.
513 2018-12-28 22:04:22 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
514 2018-12-28 22:00:46 Honey, that ship sailed a long time ago. We've been owned by the U.S. for quite some time now. We are simply a commodity sidearm of the U.S. We basically give all our raw commodities to them and the sell us back the processed product.
515 2018-12-28 21:58:34 Don't disagree but there is no "market " to post like commodities.  Prices are changing so fast it is hard to keep posted right now. We post prices at some locations if they choose to. It is would also be nice if manufacturers posted pricing as well.
516 2018-12-28 21:43:26 When will we understand the perils of relying on a commodities-driven economy? Commodities' prices are governed by supply & demand. Consumers call the shots. Because commodities are not unique & there are multiple sources. Ergo no pricing power..@teresakok

527 2018-12-28 20:25:53 Modern consumers are placing a lot more value on experiences over physical items or commodities. When shoppers purchase tangible products (other than groceries), they want those items to either tell a story, fit into their lifestyle, be completely unique, or all of the above.
528 2018-12-28 20:25:12 The act of buying commodities will become less of a chore. Companies like @Amazon & subscription businesses will make this easier through offerings like auto-renewals, one-tap purchases, & same-day delivery, so the routine component of shopping will become more streamlined.

576 2018-12-28 17:19:47 Moreki have u noticed the influx of spaza shops that are owned by foreign nationals no (my friend)? What happened to our parents that used to own them back then selling quality commodities? Today those spazas are taken by bo (my friend) introspection needs to be done.
577 2018-12-28 17:18:06 Guys who say things like "what else can a woman offer besides her body?" are just trying to keep up this program where we are seen as objects toys and commodities they have never met a woman who has truly expressed herself including their own mother who they obviously hate
578 2018-12-28 17:16:13 Você acha mesmo que a Austrália tem uma adorável capacidade de desdobrar suas forças armadas no pacifico a toa? Você acha mesmo que se sustenta o Brasil com commodities? Você ja ouviu falar do termo pais-baleia? Geopolítica?
579 2018-12-28 17:14:48 Must have been a trade deal the democrats made with these foreign country's our people for their people . Looking more and more like they are trading people as commodities . Birth certificates for no birth certificate . Pretty sad
580 2018-12-28 17:05:36 More complex than that.

581 2018-12-28 17:03:27 Commodities go up in price as shipping is more expensive. So yeah, everyone pays carbon tax, like it or not. Climate Barbie gave a pass to some of the biggest emitters of carbon. Oh, and FYI, carbon is NOT pollution.
582 2018-12-28 17:02:04 Some @OfficialPSL clubs do not see their players as human resource capital but rather commodities to be traded every six months. Then suddenly they fire their coaches for underperformance  Not entity with such high turnover of employees can survive a competitive environment
583 2018-12-28 17:00:41 @EricM_Katz Anyone doing a story on what Federal Contractors are doing to prevent losing employees affected by the government shutdown?  Contractors who don't get paid could be hot commodities in non-contractor private sector in a hot jobs market
584 2018-12-28 16:53:55 I sympathize completely, but why don't you just open a commodities account already? Leave the b.s. rules behind.

586 2018-12-28 16:46:10 The two are not comparable, but I think this unjustly whitewashes the USSR’s grievous errors during this period.

588 2018-12-28 16:39:16 The tariff peaks are mostly on raw commodities (though the confectionary tariff for example is a nightmare of compounded components). 

The 'may' of qualifies whether Brexit happens, whether there's a transition period and whether the UK gets access in the future relationship.
589 2018-12-28 16:35:03 Is there a way to keep the cost of living stable?

It’d be difficult for people to have more access to capital...just to have to capitulate to inordinate increases in rent & commodities.

Perhaps, a cap on State sales tax and fines for raising prices within the first year?
590 2018-12-28 16:33:59 Is there a way to keep the cost of living level?

It’d be pointless for the population to have more access to capital...just to have to capitulate to inordinate increases to rent & commodities.

593 2018-12-28 16:20:14 Roy, @SkyNews seeks to emulate its American big brother, where facts and reality are disposable commodities as long as the story is inflammatory and based on the minimum of effort for maximum effect. anyone with an ounce of thought sees through them in a heartbeat.

600 2018-12-28 15:59:22 Dual mandate. Growth and low inflation.  Most commodities have crashed.  They’re raising too fast.  Too hawkish.
601 2018-12-28 15:59:09 Con empresas trasnacionales que gobiernan los mercados y dominan las cadenas globales de valor, si no haces nada, estas se quedan con las actividades más interesantes y te condenan a ser exportador de commodities.

602 2018-12-28 15:56:36 Anclaje directo del bolívar a los commodities: calcular el valor del bolívar es el oro (el petróleo, los diamantes, o una canasta de ellos). El cálculo depende de 3 variables: 1) la cantidad de bs que circula en nuestra economía; 2) la cantidad de oro disponible, y su precio
603 2018-12-28 15:54:19 This is why why children should not be driven like commodities through  harsh , freezing wastelands.
604 2018-12-28 15:51:25 Es el bolívar el que debemos fortalecer si queremos detener la hiperinflación, no el petro.Fortalecer el bolívar pasa, por lo menos, por dos medidas: 1) anclar el bolívar directamente a los commodities y no a través del petro; 2) recuperar las reservas internacionales.

605 2018-12-28 15:46:03 Our defensive tackles are pretty good so I'm absolutely okay with trading down because there will be a few commodities sought after and teams will sell the farm just to move up and the Lions should cash in.
606 2018-12-28 15:44:26 He;s being WITTY with the Ideology of German intellectual culture: he doesn't think commodities function AS LITERAL FETISHES out of Hegelian fantasy either.
607 2018-12-28 15:36:58 Agree...with a caveat.  They are converting pricing of underlying commodities fr USD to CNY (see CNY oil contract.)  This is why we have long been saying CNY oil could be a gamechanger.  If China can redenominate its commodity import bill in CNY over time, China will not go bust.

609 2018-12-28 15:27:02 Animals are not ours to own. They are not commodities. Regarding them as such is wrong per se - as it inevitably leads them to be mistreated. They are living creatures worthy of respect, who (like us) can feel fear, feel pain, and can suffer.
610 2018-12-28 15:23:42 Some think KBS did it for ratings, but part of me still believes that broadcasting stations dont just think of Wanna One as commodities... they too, care for the fans thus giving us these contents before they disband. At least be thankful.
611 2018-12-28 15:22:56 I think you need to learn about #OPEC and how commodities work. I think I learned that in about grade 8.

613 2018-12-28 15:06:20 Have noticed how so many middle class people see their houses as commodities with market value rather than homes or a place to live. I suppose that’s why they think it is acceptable to demand that @KateOsamor should give up her home. They don’t seem to understand the concept.
614 2018-12-28 15:04:30 Agree.  Multi-currency commodity pricing means USD commodity derivative complex used to support USD is breaking down.  Commodities may fall < production cost unless USD is weakened (see US shale, for example.)
615 2018-12-28 15:04:01 Koskinen and Francouz’s good play so far is due to luck? Known commodities>unknown commodities?Is that the gist of what you’re saying? GM’s value their assets (& other teams assets) differently than most fans do. Intangibles weigh heavily in their decision making process.

618 2018-12-28 14:50:09 Uma vulnerabilidade que persiste é a dependência de commodities. Nas baixas dos cilcos, a conta corrente desanda. O câmbio precisa desvalorizar e/ou a economia esfriar pra conter as importações.
619 2018-12-28 14:50:05 While innocent American children and adults are sold as commodities to be used in all the ways a body could be used.  This is a horrific situation, and it cannot stand whoever must go must go. No one is safe.

623 2018-12-28 14:27:57 Sahih Bukhari (58:125) - Women are tradable commodities. A Muslim with two wives offers a fellow Muslim his pick between the two. 
Sahih Bukhari (62:81) -The most important part of a marriage contract is the unrestricted access that a man has to his wife's vagina.
624 2018-12-28 14:24:24 Is the market and economy still experiencing stagflation? Yes.

633 2018-12-28 13:56:48 Estimado Dr. Bamba, Ud. tuvo la suerte del boom de los commodities, que umentos los ingresos tributarios. Sus actos fueron: creo el CAS, redujó los aranceles y la capacidad de negociar los TLC, debilito la industrialización, etc., pero su mejor acto fue destruir al APRA.

639 2018-12-28 13:47:05 10 points for sass, but unfortunately that's not the way it works. UK farmers sell fungible commodities.

The EU provides sufficient low tariff access to enough importers to keep prices low. The UK just may not be one of them.
640 2018-12-28 13:44:51 you would think that, with the burning stock market, commodities would go through the roof. we went from loosing $1 a bushel of beans[beginning of harvest] to only loosing 10cents. back to loosing 30-40 cents over the weekend. i've talked to other farmers and the yields not there

671 2018-12-28 09:25:00 Ok, tiene sentido. Yo el tema commodities (indice Bloomberg y Natural resources) lo veo como parte del Asset Allocation, reducir riesgo sin penalizar rentabilidad a largo. Pero claro, es complejo y no se puede entender/seguir todo.
672 2018-12-28 09:24:10 Every scrip in NSE BSE except commodities follows S/R levels. however the thing to practice is how do you react if it break or reverse.

682 2018-12-28 08:05:37 Aftican Continent is attractive to China due to its abundance in oil, gold and other precious commodities. But China may pay price or will enr up pay out bad guys (terrorists/jihardists) to guaruntee its own safety & security.
683 2018-12-28 07:51:18 Oh shit let me call my broker, I forgot how important asbestos is on the commodities market  The Russians will conquer us all with the asbestos market!
684 2018-12-28 07:50:18 I empathize :). You're right.  The government has made you guys commodities. This will only end when we as a people stand up to the people in malacanang and demand more jobs and less illegals.
685 2018-12-28 07:49:26 The wrong timely Subsidy removal or what they called Subsidy removal. Removing Subsidy is not a bad thing but Buhari removed it at a time when Nigeria was facing a crisis in the soaring commodities price and since Nigerian industries still rely heavily on pms diesel it just
686 2018-12-28 07:48:29 Starts from QB...heck Peyton Manning made the likes of Austin Collie, Anthony Gonzales, Blair White, Jacob Tammie - virtually unknown commodities look like  great receivers back in IND. But then again, @casekeenum ain’t even a hair strand close to 18.
687 2018-12-28 07:46:07 To understand the main problem, especially the section that contains the analysis of intellectual commodities, will present the greatest difficulty.
688 2018-12-28 07:46:03 You are correct my boss . The gvt must either find a way of decreasing prices of basic commodities or they shud go for a pay increase
689 2018-12-28 07:35:05 Forced Marriage is only cultural!!! That's ok then.
#Ahmadiyya women are treated as commodities traded amongst the men to keep money and control  within your cult.
I don't have an opinion about your religion.
690 2018-12-28 07:31:03 Thank you for your comment. Please be informed that DTI only monitors prime commodities and basic necessities at supermarkets and wet markets.
691 2018-12-28 07:28:08 #CCB police raid godown in #Mangaluru, seize illegally stored mid-day meal commodities

693 2018-12-28 07:08:21 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.

695 2018-12-28 06:36:18 Commodities are the opium of the people.
696 2018-12-28 06:36:02 Yo when they gonna start makin commodities for tall people? I’m tired of countertops, sinks, water fountains, toilets, literally anything made for people under 5’9. What up?! Y’all gave me scoliosis. Fux wit it
697 2018-12-28 06:22:01 Весь мир это commodities trading, а я в нем алюминиевая чушка
698 2018-12-28 06:17:18 Not for nothing (see what I did there?) But Obama appointed Larry Summers on day one.  He was the biggest advocate for Gramm-Leach-Billy, and the Commodities Futures modernization act,  that neutered Glass-Steagle and deregulated derivatives.
699 2018-12-28 06:16:05 @RadhaMohanBJPfc @MCXIndialtd @ncdex exchange trading timing in future market of commodities are very severe and unhealthy for participants. Sebi without consulting anyone increased the timing of agri commodities. I as a consumer and mkt participant strongly oppose
700 2018-12-28 05:59:33 Probably not the same forces at work, @airic101. A lot of seasonal weakness in stocks is (apparently) due to natural persons doing things for tax reasons. Commodities may be more of playground for corporate persons who may not have same tax concerns?
701 2018-12-28 05:44:35 Do commodities traders trade stocks the same as equities? Is that why a small sell off end of year and hardly any buying?
702 2018-12-28 05:42:48 Are you trying to tell me that gold is special amongst commodities?  If so, I agree.
703 2018-12-28 05:06:39 are u sure that the best solution is for GoZ to increase salaries or to make sure prices of commodities have gone down?which pressure point should we press on here if we are to do industrial actions?also did u gave a thought on Pvt sector?
704 2018-12-28 05:05:03 3192: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
705 2018-12-28 05:00:01 Commodities: Natural gas -4.09%, Crude Oil +2.40%
706 2018-12-28 04:50:39 In the arts take the cash where you can get it.But how do we step into the new,if we always live in the past with old commercial commodities bought up by huge corporations and shot out in a billion dollar onslaught?in an underdogs game and yes I wear 'Levi's'
707 2018-12-28 04:37:37 Selling tangible commodities is a good job.
708 2018-12-28 04:37:01 Ok, so how do you know the New Deal would have been successful without that factor? Or without fixing commodities pricing, which isn't relevant to the UK particularly either?

Both were major parts of the New Deal strategy. Neither are relevant now.
709 2018-12-28 04:34:47 I think we get a reflationary echo bubble in commodities and EM that mirrors 2008-2011 just like the recent equity mkt was the echo bubble to 1998-2000. There is actually decent cognitive research on the echo bubble phenomenon. Eventually big inflation but tough to say when.
710 2018-12-28 04:34:11 Commodities & Controlled Items yes.   But not otherwise.
711 2018-12-28 04:24:38 Just to be clear, when you guys talk “Commodities” do you include Gold and Silver? Many do, I don’t, so just interested to know the thinking
712 2018-12-28 04:15:38 commodities have already crashed, any cheaper and they will be giving it away for free
713 2018-12-28 04:07:27 Wish happy, happening and healthy birthday to @arunjaitley. He is one of the rare commodities found in politics - intellectuals. I appreciate his profound knowledge and wish him best luck in coming elections
714 2018-12-28 03:43:02 That doesn't really fit with the UK's current position and economy type. 

FDR fiddled the Gold Reserve for starters. Even if we could do the same, most of our gold was sold off. Beyond that, commodities pricing was fixed, but we're a services driven economy.
715 2018-12-28 03:42:53 Tanking property, tanking ASX, tanking Paris targets, tanking commodities, tanking two party preferred, tanking daddies...
A lot to talk about
716 2018-12-28 03:25:12 Something we neglect in our observations abt how much farther our parents’ cash went back in the day is how everyone is paying more money for shittier clothing and commodities today. Even "higher end" items are shittier and with inflation, more expensive for sure
717 2018-12-28 03:12:56 Yes...commodities first crash and then spike.
718 2018-12-28 03:06:15 1/  Are price-value hotel conglomerates traded on darkweb organized crime commodities exchanges? Surveilioextortion marketwatch? Global HUMINT recordings, residue of every compromised agent in every hotel room.  Bought out by cash rich financier, oligarch, or up and coming boss?
719 2018-12-28 02:59:46 if a county takes all of a country’s money and raw commodities it’s not hard to just make it permanent lol
720 2018-12-28 02:55:30 Big discounts being offered on many names here in #commodity land. Maybe it will keep crashing and you will find the low, but hope is not a strategy. No reason not to be adding here on #Gold and #Silver first and foremost and looking to add to #Commodities on weakness.
721 2018-12-28 02:54:20 This is the result of forming Govt with the support of independent candidates. Blackmailing and black marketing of goods and commodities hv already started under Congress regime. Everything black happening in MP.
722 2018-12-28 02:47:36 I predict that bread, milk, cigarettes, bottled water and whiskey will be hot commodities in #NYC in the next few hours
723 2018-12-28 02:45:31 Sim. Somos exportadores de commodities. Se se desvalorizam muito, quebramos. Pelo menos temos “alguma variedade” delas.
724 2018-12-28 02:40:13 IMO Depends if USD is able to maintain its monopoly on commodities; fail that, and outcome is less clear as USD begins to look more like other currencies, where yields rise and currencies fall all the time.

727 2018-12-28 02:19:49 No , desde ya Alfonsín heredó un déficit del 17% , con una deuda del 110% del PBI , con un país que venía de una guerra , con commodities por el piso , Macri recibió un déficit del 4.1% del PBI con una deuda que era del 19% del PBI , Alfonsin bajo la pobreza del 25 al 19%

730 2018-12-28 02:11:56 Quanto a questão dos leilões de commodities, veja um e entenda que aquilo se chama política vc faz o Preço mais barato pra quem te apoia, por isso passa no jornal os governos que apoiam ou não a nossa presidência, sei que pra vc deve ser um saco mas é uma questão importante
731 2018-12-28 02:06:04 O que impede uma empresa chinesa de criar um iPhone 4x mais barato é o estado e suas leis de propriedade intelectual, e commodities são vendidas por leilão, onde fica no topo o vendedor com menor preço, aliás a formação do preço de qualquer produto é assim
732 2018-12-28 02:05:17 O Brasil não "entrou nessa crise"... está em crise nos últimos 3 mandatos, salvou-se o primeiro em função das commodities. PLZ, Jornalismo imparcial!!
733 2018-12-28 01:52:51 If it's hooked up to a live data feed markets are tracking it? So they HT assets aren't.. dark money.. that is to say it's being openly traded like other commodities?
734 2018-12-28 01:50:53 Awesome,  guess what's being added to the Economics course on Tuesday.  Commodities options trading made funny.
735 2018-12-28 01:48:18 This line is happening as we speak:

“This loss of the dollar vehicle will also bring the destruction of many contemporary derivative markets that priced commodities for their value as trading items, rather than their traditional good use.”
736 2018-12-28 01:47:08 Acontece isso direto né só ver o iPhone e a Samsung com seus tops de linha na mesma faixa de preço, mesma coisa na indústria farmacêutica e na de commodities. Me desculpa amigo mas a teoria é boa só que a prática é muito diferente
737 2018-12-28 01:33:24 Being a contrarian #investor requires a different mindset and longer timeline, investing in hated unloved #sectors and companies can be extremely profitable if patient..... #Commodities #agriculture #PreciousMetals #nickel #copper #gold #Silver
738 2018-12-28 01:29:54 The two most valuable commodities of the 21st Century are convenience and data. Each one enables the other, and whoever can afford control of one has an almost terrifying level of influence over those being data-mined.
739 2018-12-28 01:21:06 "Entre 2004 y 2007, durante el mandato de Néstor, gracias al llamado "viento de cola" de las commodities, el tipo de cambio alto y el crecimiento a tasas chinas..." Ya para el 2008 empezaron los problemas, inflación, etc.Terminaron en PBI negativo.
740 2018-12-28 01:17:57 Your heart, time and money are precious commodities. Take care.

742 2018-12-28 00:53:19 Muy buen hilo. Gracias por compartirlo! Un par de observaciones. Aparentemente si bien es cierto que los precios de commodities son inferiores a los del 2011, habría que analizar el volumen total proyectado en TN para la cosecha. Se estaba hablando de posible cosecha récord.
743 2018-12-28 00:46:59 Votes aren't commodities. You don't just count them.
744 2018-12-28 00:45:38 Excelente hilo. Unos comentarios:

1. TC alto no es suficiente (ni necesario) para que suban expo *en el corto plazo*. Son más sensibles a crecim de socios comerciales, clima, etc. En commodities ya somos competitivos. La deva cierra brecha, como decís, por menos impo.
745 2018-12-28 00:36:54 Central bankers answer to a countries Treasury. Currencies should be secured by a basket of commodities where gold and oil dominates.  Debts will not be forgiven, taxes will not disappear. The Fed will compete like all monopolies once broken up and you're right about the new govt
746 2018-12-28 00:28:10 ......"I'm not a sexist, but women's bodies should be seen as public commodities and forcibly used for men's sexual gratification including forced prengnancy and unpaid childcare.  Only a feminazi would see that as sexist."
