It's a deep web, privacy coin with THE strongest community based on size in Crypto right now. Look at TOR's logo, it's an onion. And it's one of the most widely used private browsers

50 2018-01-09 23:57:58 how some crypto can be a solution. I only see it as solution, when profits are used for lawyers :D
51 2018-01-09 23:57:49 False equivalence completely.. He does not have to date a transgender if he does not want to. It's PREFERENCE, NOT PREJUDICE.
52 2018-01-09 23:57:37 This is also the most expensive time to buy computer parts but it isn't going to drop til the Crypto hype dies down
53 2018-01-09 23:57:32 Oh you right I read it wrong my bad. Just noticed. In crypto coins rise and fall 27% every day. Way more volatile and I feel more comfortable trading between that than stocks. Just don't know stocks as well I guess. Also like the gains to be made in crypto as well as the ideas
54 2018-01-09 23:57:32 I will attentively follow #Benebit project, witch ICO will started in 11 days already! Are you with me, guys? #ICO #blockchain #tokensale #crypto
55 2018-01-09 23:57:26 you can criticize roger for a lot of things, but you cant deny that he is an advocate for true decentralization since almost the beginning of the crypto movement.
56 2018-01-09 23:57:15 2018 will be a great year for cryptocurrencies. Banks don't want to miss this huge new asset class. They want in and fast. VC funds can't find any decent investment opportunities because everybody is on this Ethereum thing. HODL ON #ethereum #bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #crypto
57 2018-01-09 23:57:14 So literally, if I make a crypto currency, and call it  fucking whatever blockchain, I can get a bunch of losers to give me money?

Sign me the fuck up!
58 2018-01-09 23:57:10 Join Medium and read up on it. There are wallet upgrades to make it granny proof. There are huge amounts of industry handshakes being performed, there are sensors being developed, equipment to produce nodes etc. Far more than any other crypto.
59 2018-01-09 23:56:54 me too (:
60 2018-01-09 23:56:50 Look at the last 8 days dude. Do your research. Anyone can pick a time frame to make their point.
61 2018-01-09 23:56:49 $ETH testing 1.3k and $BTC potentially retesting $14k. Interesting to see whether #ETH breaks through and keeps running or comes back down, and whether #BTC has a rebound or breaks support. #cryptocurrency
62 2018-01-09 23:56:48 that speech made me very cranky. The NYDFS / Symphony 'well they changed their platform' thing is a different class of problem; claiming metadata has no useful info; claiming nothing they want will affect "the millions of devices used by everyday citizens"
63 2018-01-09 23:56:46 So i can hide my crypto from my husband!
64 2018-01-09 23:56:46 why has no one created a fandom crypto currency like forreal, that's free money just lying on the floor

93 2018-01-09 23:54:31 Fair enough, but I've lost too many crypto coins over the years to crashed hard drives or lost data. I guess it just comes down to personal preference and trust and how much you wanna work for it. But, it is good advise and I thank you.
94 2018-01-09 23:54:23 Great AMA by @HorizonState just now. Can't believe this company doing so well and suck a low market cap still. Leaps and bounds ahead of other crypto  companies as far as business progression goes. Well done, glad to be a hodler. $hst #Cryptocurreny #cryptocurrency #BTC

110 2018-01-09 23:52:48 Why the alt coin crypto paradigm will fail: moving from a store of value (bitcoin) to transactional alt coin tokens requires a constant “price per token”. The volatility in price prevents any real transactions from happening.
111 2018-01-09 23:52:48 Otra ejemplo más de lo ignorante que son en economía. Alguien les metió el cuento de la crypto moneda y no entendería que todo se basa en la confianza que no tiene nada que ver con garantías. Solo la oferta y la demanda determina precio . Y@como en Uds no cree nadie
112 2018-01-09 23:52:45 Because crypto is volatile.
113 2018-01-09 23:52:40 150$ Soon
114 2018-01-09 23:52:37 Investing in crypto takes patience. Just like any other type of investment out there... stocks, flipping houses, owning a nee business. The return of investment #ROI can take years before gaining profits. Hold & don't let it consume your lifestyle  #cryptocurrency #investments

121 2018-01-09 23:52:12 You can save more money with a good tax accountant or CPA who knows the law than you can cheating the IRS. Tons of loopholes with legal ways to minimize your taxes. Play the game by the rules. Have you seen the rule book it is HUGE :) #cryptogainsaretaxable

150 2018-01-09 23:50:45 LBC, FLDC, BLK, MCO....maybe KMD....some ideas but you are probably WAY ahead of me!! You have great calls.....I bought XRB long time ago thanks to you!! 
151 2018-01-09 23:50:33 Hey @CNBCFastMoney @MelissaLeeCNBC Can you please comment on the fact that there are virtually NO public implementations, besides crypto-kittens, on the Ethereum blockchain? People need to understand that the public token, ETH, isnt being used at all right now but for speculation
152 2018-01-09 23:50:29 True!
153 2018-01-09 23:50:20 "If we can manage to do something computationally feasible and good for the overall well being of the world, surely we can do something mathematically infeasible and subject to rampant and dangerous abuse."
154 2018-01-09 23:50:14 I'm going to create a crypto currency for snap chatters, where the money only transfers into the recipient's account for about 6 seconds before it disappears.
155 2018-01-09 23:50:02 omg, game development? I'm in!
156 2018-01-09 23:49:53 Someone needs to make a movie about this . . . How the #Crypto movement is gaining traction, becoming more Mainstream, and pounding on the Doors of Banks!!! WE'RE COMING!!!! AND WE AIN'T GONNA TAKE IT NO MORE!!!

161 2018-01-09 23:49:18 Still can't believe this unprofessional and idiotic stunt was pulled without any warning. Market manipulation at its finest. Lucky crypto ain't as regulated as fiat currency of the law will be coming down hard on you lot!
162 2018-01-09 23:49:15 i'm very pro-this kodak crypto mining scam because it will inevitably lead to kodak going "surprise! everyone can shoot on 35mm now and it's FREE"
163 2018-01-09 23:49:15 New post: "Report: South Korea Eyes Joint Crypto Regulations With China, Japan"
164 2018-01-09 23:49:13 Do you think it is going down under 720 sats again??
165 2018-01-09 23:49:07 Like what?
166 2018-01-09 23:48:41 xrp down
167 2018-01-09 23:48:34 Think of the real time metrics to evaluate a cryptocurrency vs quarterly stock reports. Plus all the technological advantages of a crypto vs a stock!
168 2018-01-09 23:48:17 J'suis sur le site zara rayon enfant entrain de tout dévaliser mais quand va falloir entrer le crypto et cliquer sur valider j'vais voir flou
169 2018-01-09 23:48:15 I'd donate a heap to groups that support the victims and families of domestic and sorcery accusation based violence in Papua New Guinea. It's absolutely unthinkable that in 2018 women (and men) are being raped, tortured and burnt alive just from a baseless accusation.
170 2018-01-09 23:48:12 @MartinSLewis Hi Martin, with the rise of crypto currencies what’s your thoughts on investing? High risk, high reward? Low risk, high reward? High risk, low reward? Be good to hear your thoughts. Cheers.
171 2018-01-09 23:48:09 What wallet bud? I’ve been balls deep in crypto stuff for like a month so far.
172 2018-01-09 23:48:07 Thinking about the ‘next’ Bitcoin, which of the following crypto currencies would you buy to hold long term? @RonnieMoas #Bitcoin #CryptoCurrencies #cryptocurrency #ripple #xrp #cryptocurrencynews #BTCUSD #coinmarketcap #altcoins #crypto #coinsmarkets #coinbase #BitcoinCash

178 2018-01-09 23:47:55 @vandecrypto @ZOllison @christy_herman  Check out Vande Crypto 
179 2018-01-09 23:47:51 Just as sure as every other crypto analyst  
180 2018-01-09 23:47:50 Did you guys buy any ZCL ZClassic for the upcoming Bitcoin Private air drop yet. Everybody is thinking Bitcoin Private will be $2K a coin. 1 ZCL gets 1 Bitcoin private as well. Right now ZCL is at $200.  Backdoor way to get more Bitcoin Privates.
181 2018-01-09 23:47:39 Tron will be up alot tonight, announcing partnership in a few minutes
182 2018-01-09 23:47:32 Right....you, who is the developer for this. Not an investor expecting results. I already got out of xvg. Waiting for news on tron and then out of that as well. If your coin works out the  great. I'm all for what you're doing but I'm trying to make money.
183 2018-01-09 23:47:24 wow it does arbitrage or what?
184 2018-01-09 23:47:23 Unfortunately I don't. It was long forgotten until I got back into crypto in 2016, and realized how much bitcoins were worth.
185 2018-01-09 23:47:22 25 percent gain in the Dow and crypto currency -the next big bubble.
186 2018-01-09 23:47:18 So happy I found a broker to trade crypto currencies with
187 2018-01-09 23:47:09 what crypto you own?
188 2018-01-09 23:47:00 I’ve maxed out my alt crypto fund into trx..
189 2018-01-09 23:46:57 Newbies be warned you are entering  a market in crypto that is very high some days it feels like the dky is falling just put your phone down and enjoy your day and come back 24 hrs shen tge market calms down people make foolish trades and end up losing money.
190 2018-01-09 23:46:53 Credit in the form of transferable bank deposits does carry some default risk, but has other advantages over crypto as a payment method, namely speed, cheapness, and denomination in the most widely used unit of account, hence less purchasing power risk.
191 2018-01-09 23:46:52 Yeah. I'm all for the decentralized, no government involment side of crypto but the backside of that coin (no pun intended) is that NOTHING is regulated and the exchanges can do whatever the fuck they want.
192 2018-01-09 23:46:49 Great interview. I highly believe in IOTA 2018. #hodl #rebuy
193 2018-01-09 23:46:47 I really cannot believe what a life changer crypto has been to me! And we are still on the launch pad, the word is most definitely out now, and more people will be financially free day by day!
194 2018-01-09 23:46:46 I thought we discussed this? Remember the crypto I was curious back last winter? I did buy a few of those, bought them cheap enough I can’t lose.
195 2018-01-09 23:46:35 If I were trying to get rich quick I’d be taking out loans and buying crypto like all these other dreamers. Trust your DD and bet on history

199 2018-01-09 23:46:21 One of the best propositions in the world of crypto right now, in my opinion. At current prices you really can't lose on this one. I'm in the process of accumulating as much as I can $QASH #QASH
200 2018-01-09 23:46:21 How’s that strategy working out now! Crypto sucks!  What causes this shit to just take a dive?
201 2018-01-09 23:46:10 still dont get how some crypto, which will make KODAK millions, will help photographers with anything. Another Bullshit, all ICOs mostly helping themselves and a some investors who get out on time
202 2018-01-09 23:46:10 this could be the most genius play i've seen in crypto.  freak everyone the fuck out, price drops, then go in for the kill. brilliant!
203 2018-01-09 23:46:10 It's not too late man. Rly.

205 2018-01-09 23:45:58 The block debate is far from won, why do video files have encoders to reduce space? Do you think you can increase the size forever? As for transactions, the silver of the crypto space owns that with 95% of it having been transacted @SatoshiLite can help you with those figures.
206 2018-01-09 23:45:56 Nice lol
207 2018-01-09 23:45:49 Beside my work and studies, a run a small NGO to help youth, where I give free workshops that seek to prevent different types of violence and empower youth :) I'm seeking in crypto new ways to help youth and create new opportunities #YouAreAnotherMe :)
208 2018-01-09 23:45:44 If I was the CEO of a publicly traded company I would be hinting at the company launching its own crypto currency. Watch the stock price rise. (No there is no CC / Yes I will dump all my stock at the peak)
209 2018-01-09 23:45:39 When? This is rumor?
210 2018-01-09 23:45:34 Let's see

214 2018-01-09 23:45:01 People don’t panic sell your crypto because @CoinMarketCap pulled koren exchnages off!! Those prices didn’t work for you anyways.

218 2018-01-09 23:44:46 #RPToken We are following the Real Estate/Crypto space. Things have been building as more companies and projects evolved. Then during the Xmas and New Year there was some announcements and they had some awesome growth. It is such an exciting time to be in the Crypto World

236 2018-01-09 23:43:04 I only look at verge long term, and see an organic upward trend since it's birth. I could care less about week to week. yearly, sure. weekly, not at all.
237 2018-01-09 23:42:48 The reason for such volatility on @binance_2017 is that there’s a lot of newbies in #crypto and #binance is 1 of the biggest exchanges. When price moves down the inexperienced show their weak hands because they don’t understand volatility & they lose money while whales gain. #trx

257 2018-01-09 23:41:23 Love the Crypto world. It makes politics a thing of the past. What/Who makes it or brakes is enterily up to all the milllions of people working it. "Globalism" done right? I think so.

260 2018-01-09 23:41:05 I am actually trawling through cheap shitty coins ATM, just look at cryptopia, people will buy anything, probably make money on it to
261 2018-01-09 23:40:54 Rare to see someone in crypto admit and display this lol

268 2018-01-09 23:40:15 @BigRig_Trader , @BigBirdofBayst, that's some truth right there.  The MJ and Crypto effect has people expecting 100% daily returns on every play. Realistic expectations have been distorted.  Nice to have a healthy pullback and consolidation to move things forwards. Ty 2 u both

272 2018-01-09 23:40:07 And when the music stops in this game of crypto musical chairs, things will get chaotic. But as we've seen in the past, when one game stops, another eventually takes over. Slightly different format, but similar crazy jumps of value of something in a very short time.
273 2018-01-09 23:40:04 You could just buy fucking crypto with $3400
274 2018-01-09 23:40:03 That's not 100% true, though. Mining is in part reconciling transactions. It isn't merely the generation of new coins.

The supply of coins in other cryptos is limited such that the difficulty of crypto problems will also scale with the needs of the creation of new coins.

288 2018-01-09 23:39:22 while it’s gonna take a while for me to publicly say exactly how much i’ve made off crypto, i will say this. i dropped out of high school freshman year and was told i’d be a failure. i now make more than my principal makes in 5 years. don’t let people tell you shit
289 2018-01-09 23:39:21 Yes they are! After starting MPesa! I’m so happy you’re sponsoring crypto education in Kenya! Is there info about this on the website?

292 2018-01-09 23:39:10 I thought Dennis Rodman was the subject matter expert on crypto
293 2018-01-09 23:39:10 Crap litecoin too.. what’s going on? So Jamie publicly changed the tone and started shorting crypto to get better price?
294 2018-01-09 23:39:10 ErikVoorhees ShapeShift_io PeterSchiff July 2018! That is like 3 crypto years.

I made this account 174 days ago. Every day since then $crypto has taken up more and more of my time and long-term plans. You can't do better than making friends and money at the same time. Thank you guys, sincerely. Let's keep it going.

Being a long-term holder will only work for so long.

299 2018-01-09 23:38:32 Ok so I put my MacBook into a crypto currency mining pool, it’s currently averaging 56.70 H/s. The person who correctly guesses how many pennies I earn tonight will get half the earnings!
300 2018-01-09 23:38:26 I will say one thing about the crypto currency trading world- If you have a weak heart and and panic you're gonna get wrecked.
There's tons of money to be made, but you ain't gonna get rich in a week.   People freak out at the first big dip. Hang in there a month and see.

456 2018-01-09 23:28:31 Con las crypto puedes hacer trading, difícil, pero puedes. Pero como se genera valor es con paciencia, apoyando proyectos impresionantes, aprendiendo a controlarse uno mismo. Investiga, aprende, arriesga y gana.

478 2018-01-09 23:27:29 Yes,  that was a very odd sequence.   Most alts have hit a sea of red.   No worries,  things change so fast in crypto.   Personally,  I’m very optimistic for the next few weeks, months & longer.   Great Day!
479 2018-01-09 23:27:25 Yeah but when will all this downtimes end?? Expect a huge growth of crypto community and act accordingly!!! Every day the same....
480 2018-01-09 23:27:22 Yeah... well... hire better cryptographers if you want to break the crypto private industry is creating. Did whining get the nazis to give the allies an enugma machine? No... you want something, work for it.

492 2018-01-09 23:26:33 I think the days of ICO's making billions are over. 2017 saw a huge number of them, and a large majority of them were scams or pump/dumps.

That being said, starting an ICO to fund OSS sounds like a good idea, but I think it goes against what crypto is all about.
493 2018-01-09 23:26:18 Ethereum now trading at $1310 on some exchanges.

497 2018-01-09 23:26:00 $ETC may drop before launching. Don't put all in it. Too many calls going for ETC, stay alert
498 2018-01-09 23:25:57 No doubt. Awesome space to be involved in. The nature of decentralization in general at least has the ability to spread things out much more. I think old systems that decide to fight crypto to the end will be the biggest losers...that in itself COULD cause for a major shift in $

513 2018-01-09 23:24:48 I think #Kodak just gave every struggling company a game plan how to get some fresh cash and keep investors happy. If this is spreading, the influx of institutional money into crypto will create a bull run north of anybody’s expectation. Well deserved, #ETH.

538 2018-01-09 23:23:31 That works too my man. If your not a day trader I would not advise it. There is nothing wrong with "Set it and Forget it"!!
539 2018-01-09 23:23:30 Just to clear up, I'm still massively bullish on crypto as a whole, just starting to see a trend of people ignoring basic risk management and investing money that they really can't afford to lose. There's simply not any punishment for this in a bull market.

611 2018-01-09 23:18:30 I am being careful I am holding lol the only people who lost money are the ones who sold if they listened to you. Look at the volume! You give terrible advice. And it doesn't just LOOK like it's going up. IT IS going up.

622 2018-01-09 23:18:00 You either believe in it or you don’t. Pick the #crypto you like, HOLD and buy dips. In the long term this means absolutely nothing! If you don’t think it’s the future, then sell it and get out. Just make sure you do your homework. It’s that simple. What coin do you believe in?
623 2018-01-09 23:17:56 No way i’m gonna sell, this thing is going to give amazing results!
624 2018-01-09 23:17:55 Bought a few days ago at $0.18. If anything Im looking to get more on this dip.

630 2018-01-09 23:17:24 that's why nobody trusts the Rothschilds.  They're rich off the money they control.  crypto is supposed to be a solution to that problem.  not another version of it.

633 2018-01-09 23:17:17 Why hold when the money is in intra-day trading? The problem with crypto is inexperienced kids with cultish attitudes in a coin. It's economics. Stop this "to the moon" bullshit. You all sound like kids. Learn technical analysis. Trade like a grown-ups.
634 2018-01-09 23:17:16 Tron is a token. It runs on Ether. Not sure why it’s even talked about in crypto coin contexts. Cardano, however, is an amazing project and a marvelous platform in my opinion.
635 2018-01-09 23:17:10 Well then you're a fool, the people you are posting that for are exactly the ones who will lose all their money because of current loses. You say its a hot list but don't say who has researched it. People like you are why Crypto's get a bad name.

657 2018-01-09 23:15:47 That would only be true if the assets were useless as collateral, but you can hedge them, lend against them, reserve back a promise for delivery or labor, ect. 

The dynamic balance of fiat liquidity against demand for crypto-as-collateral drives price discovery. AAA collateral.
658 2018-01-09 23:15:41 For newcommers in crypto-world, this is a point where you will say "Why the fuck did I sell", and whales will be laughing. Trust me stand your ground and #HODL! I just put my whole portfolio down at 680 satoshi.

727 2018-01-09 23:10:43 That’s how it works. Before the BIG pump the select few are told which coin to buy. Then they tell the rest of the pumpers. The select few make money and the pumpers lose money.
728 2018-01-09 23:10:36 The point is that neither extreme is ideal. The ideal is a middle ground that nudges from centralisation to decentralisation as the needs of the system dictate. There is no absolute solution, and that's why i have a problem with crypto. It disrespects the fluidity of the system

750 2018-01-09 23:08:47 seriously do people really not know how to look up what exchange a coin is on. If you can't handle that this probably is not the game for you.  It looks like he had a type and meant to say 4.6x not 46x.
751 2018-01-09 23:08:40 $TRX.X I wish there was a way to block ridiculously stupid crypto stocks on StockTwits from being on my trending topics.
752 2018-01-09 23:08:32 Tax season coming with trumps new tax plan and an average of $2k per family of extra tax return.I’d say everything will Moon in mid February
753 2018-01-09 23:08:30 Weak hands selling, strong hands buying, if you don't know crypto don't trade guys. Stop panicking and losing money. Asia taking your gifts with no hesitation, so am I, but I don't want to steal from you. $TRX

764 2018-01-09 23:08:06 Coinbase, currently the most  popular exchange for crypto newcomers, only supports four currencies at  the moment. Unless it wants to start losing ground, it will need to  improve its infrastructure and execute a plan for world domination.
765 2018-01-09 23:07:48 Precisely. Dude that put me on to crypto quit his job to invest and start his own ico... But his pops fronted him 200k for the operation, so I ain't doing that lmao

905 2018-01-09 22:58:45 100 JPY(BTC): 1293.071 ~ 1294.603 KRW(BTC)
906 2018-01-09 22:58:44 I agree. I know a dip is not fun, but this is normal in crypto. No reason to panic sell. It always goes back up
907 2018-01-09 22:58:43 Agreed! Its a learning exerience.
908 2018-01-09 22:58:40 I like your perspective

912 2018-01-09 22:58:35 Paid pumper!
913 2018-01-09 22:58:35 Crypto is nascent in the sense that it is almost entirely replicating the crappy financial systems that have always existed. Today's financial system has finally been regulated to keep rentierism in check. Crypto is the loophole out of this

942 2018-01-09 22:56:47 its a known phenomenon, the less amount of crypto you have the lower the intrinsic value.
943 2018-01-09 22:56:43 Will likely get a strong pump but just know it was the scam coin before bitconnect was a thing.
944 2018-01-09 22:56:41 you get a crypto wall it's "even better" lol

Or at least refund him some of his ticket 
950 2018-01-09 22:56:29 LMFAO!!! im going to exit all crypto markets.
951 2018-01-09 22:56:16 Sorry you missed it. I got in and out like usual for a good gain. I miss most of the move but the steady increase in balance is the trade off I can accept.  I never trade crypto on anything but my fast home PC connection.  I am sure there will be a pullback at some point. GoodL!

Being purely factual.
961 2018-01-09 22:55:45 Stay out of all ETH currency pairs until ETH consolidates...it is throwing off even the best of setups #ETH #binance #cryptocurrency #cryptotrading #crypto #cryptocurrencynews
962 2018-01-09 22:55:39 Your trading sounds about like mine right now. From this point a picking a few and just holding for a week. Day trading crypto is hard, swing trading maybe more successful.
963 2018-01-09 22:55:36 Id pay to watch young guys leveraging crypto.
964 2018-01-09 22:55:24 Really dopey, can you show me what crypto represents in your feeble little mind?
965 2018-01-09 22:55:24 That's my feed.
966 2018-01-09 22:55:18 probably a bad update server-side do the trick, however bug or not much things can be done in a week. luckily there are better alternatives
967 2018-01-09 22:55:18 And thank goodness they do
968 2018-01-09 22:55:18 You can now send one $ETH to dogetoken.eth to get 100,000 $DGT plus bonus! Then trade it on $ZRX or however you humans trade these days. #dogecoin

      So joke
                much crazy
   Very #crypto
                           Wow!
969 2018-01-09 22:55:14 I wish 
970 2018-01-09 22:55:13 I agree. I think crypto is extremely nascent, but I think the direction of crypto will change - and is changing - as that sort of model comes crashing down. Which it will.
971 2018-01-09 22:55:12 U killing it!
972 2018-01-09 22:55:10 Vu le mode de fabrication des bitcoins, je trouve cette crypto-monnaie vraiment minable. #ouaisbon
973 2018-01-09 22:55:05 Crypto twitter is just a massive pump and dump group $ETC .
Just everyone shilling the same coin which creates selfulfilling prophecies.
974 2018-01-09 22:55:03 Market cap wise I agree at the moment, but not in the long run.
975 2018-01-09 22:54:54 I've switched to @get_delta a week ago, and am a happy camper.
976 2018-01-09 22:54:51 Yeah sell now or take this guys pills and be holding either the same or slightly higher....verge will not triple in 3 weeks
977 2018-01-09 22:54:47 Why is it so hard to buy crypto?!?! Every app every website I sign up for something happens or fucks up or doesn’t work properly. To top is off customer support sucks for most places
978 2018-01-09 22:54:46 U have faith in $dot ?

983 2018-01-09 22:54:33 Bir insan neden 742 sts den zarar ederk TRX satar bir düşün? Coin piyasasına dalan yenilerin panik satışı olduğunu düşünüyorum. Tepeden aldı bu garipler ama grafikler çift dip yapıyor. Bu kadar satış baskısının bir sonucu olacaktır. Ben artış bekliyorum. 1100 kırarsa yürür/uçar.
984 2018-01-09 22:54:24 ur a crypto-hegelian too, yknow
985 2018-01-09 22:54:23 loool!!

'growing up in baathist syria in the 80s and 90s we didn't have any crypto currency, because, you know, resistance....'
986 2018-01-09 22:54:19 Certainly hope the TSX is smarter than to involve themselves in this murky crypto field.
987 2018-01-09 22:54:14 #XVG to reach $0.50 soon?
988 2018-01-09 22:54:13 buying crypto in china is banned, fyi. Trying pleading to something else.

990 2018-01-09 22:54:06 Huch. $crypto klappt ähnlich wie Hashtags #crypto. Wusste ich gar nicht.
991 2018-01-09 22:54:05 hell yeah bro #Crypto ICO sexy lady dude i bought this new ICO called rohirrim based on Horse power basically led by the rohan empire but the testosterone on the horses are like 1000% so it's faster like our portfolio gonna go 1000% :D COin never sleeps ;D
992 2018-01-09 22:54:03 Crypto is the worst of stratifying exploitative market-based capitalism. True value lies in allocating a greater share of the pie to those who actually work to produce it.
993 2018-01-09 22:53:59 ZNY上がっとる笑
994 2018-01-09 22:53:43 Then you obviously haven't looked thoroughly into it
995 2018-01-09 22:53:39 Should i sel my verge for tron ?
996 2018-01-09 22:53:38 Great news??  The value died today.
997 2018-01-09 22:53:34 If you think that’s laughable, check out the reaction of the ‘crypto’ kiddies rejoicing that he is “relenting”, going through “stages of loss”, etc. Now that IS funny...
998 2018-01-09 22:53:26 Since no one knows me here I can talk crypto
999 2018-01-09 22:53:24 I'd like to see #XRP's marketcap against these numbers! That will throw the projections out of the park. @Ripple
1000 2018-01-09 22:53:01 @Crypto_Flower with LOAN trading as low as it is right now do you think it is a good time to take a larger position if you weren’t able to get much during the ICO?
1001 2018-01-09 22:52:54 Lol.

One Love, Mad Bitcoins.
One Love.

Open-sourced braingasms.
That's what the crypto-community is all about.

1003 2018-01-09 22:52:47 So far following his recommendation and if course spreading everything out, I've enough to buy a brand new car, but my eyes are set on a bigger picture, my mortgage. Back to my point, he was spot on with redcoin, made my profits and sold.
1004 2018-01-09 22:52:45 Tfw ur pissed off because you only made 60% on your crypto investment last week
1005 2018-01-09 22:52:44 A team of us have been praying into and building out a platform for crypto in the kingdom, particulalry helping to educate and empower women. I would donate it towards that. Its the best way I can see creating exponential growth for crypto, Kingdom wealth, & empowering women
1006 2018-01-09 22:52:39 It’s tough to ever know because this crypto market is so unpredictable at all times...I’m just focusing long term and praying lol
1007 2018-01-09 22:52:39 I think there are a lot of people in crypto and blockchain who see it like you do. I don’t think blockchain is important because it gives us more ways to make money. I think it’s important because it forces us to rethink money, what it is, and how it works.
1008 2018-01-09 22:52:31 This week i found out the estate agent I dealt with has quit his job to become a crypto trader. If that becomes a full scale phenomenon, with nurses, docs, delivery men, road sweepers, builders all switching to crypto rentierism from real value provision society will collapse.
1009 2018-01-09 22:52:29 How good is it!
1010 2018-01-09 22:52:27 Honestly, just checked this today. This is what I call "room to grow"
1011 2018-01-09 22:52:22 I'm furious that binance charged me 3 WABI to withdraw.. criminals
1012 2018-01-09 22:52:10 I made @Crypto_Bitlord one last week but his was a bit easier since its a drawing and not a real person/mask glad u liked!
1013 2018-01-09 22:52:10 It's as easy as depend only on the exchange API (wich already they do) and store the log locally on the phone.
1014 2018-01-09 22:52:01 While we're here, you should grab some of my new crypto I'm launching next week, y€€zycoin

1017 2018-01-09 22:51:58 NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY TOKEN/USD on YOBIT
1018 2018-01-09 22:51:56 I would never buy Ripple. The whole point of Crypto currency is built off the idea of getting out from under bank control. So why would I want to buy a bank controlled currency?
1019 2018-01-09 22:51:55 Buy
1020 2018-01-09 22:51:54 Ahaaaa, e a Crypto Mom, que largou o emprego pra negociar eth, que a gente ficou zoando qdo o preço dumpou, agora ela quer vingança
1021 2018-01-09 22:51:53 Austin is awesome. And I'm thinking of moving back there soon. Driving to Cali will probably take you more than a day better to fly until we get some self driving cars in the future.

1028 2018-01-09 22:51:18 nice try ;) ahahh would I have a huge supply and I'd.
1029 2018-01-09 22:51:18 @coinlook! #1 FUD spreader of crypto speculations.

1037 2018-01-09 22:50:57 KEEP BUYING $TRX. 

newbies are selling in panic,  is eating it all. Jump in as $TRX recovers the biggest FUD in history
1038 2018-01-09 22:50:56 My portofolio 
50% ico = solid safe profit 
20% $BTC $ETH $NEO , You always need them for ico's or buy altcoins
30% I invest in altcoins 20% I just do mid term/long term like $DBC $QLC $DENT $SNOV $AION from the 10% I do in undervalued gems $FDX $WANDX $SPANK $WISH $sphtx
1039 2018-01-09 22:50:53 Fair point. 

But with all of the excitement around crypto couldn’t the IB just turn around and sell their derivatives positions to some aggressive investors? Repackage and spread the risk thinly across the market.
1040 2018-01-09 22:50:53 I am so proud of the @Bancor team and the progress they have been making. The people who understand the protocol know it is one of the most undervalued crypto projects right now. I expect $BNT to go up 10x in the next 6 months. #Ethereum #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency #blockchain #eth

1042 2018-01-09 22:50:50 Not just Wannacry, but there's been other cases of the Norks using ransomware to generate BTC/hard currencies. It's more labor intensive, but much better than a huge heist. Crypto currency is vulnerable to the NSA/TAO though
1043 2018-01-09 22:50:39 Vsx is my fav coin
1044 2018-01-09 22:50:38 Well it's simple. People are selling and pulling out because they want quick profit or don't care for XVG and that's fine. It helps us get rid of the dead weight. They'll be sorry for making a quick buck.
1045 2018-01-09 22:50:36 Investing isn't a overnight success bs story. This isn't "get rich quick" to invest requires patience and a lot of time..
1046 2018-01-09 22:50:34 In other news, PrinnyCoin has just been released and is doing amazingly well. To purchase a PrinnyCoin, just send me 100 US dollars in an unmarked envelope and you will be on the forefront of this exciting crypto-currency!
1047 2018-01-09 22:50:29 This is the state of crypto this month. The North American Blockchain conference isn't accepting crypto for payment anymore because of network congestion. Nobody can do anything in crypto because everybody wants to be here and is getting in the way. #cryptocurrency #CryptoNews

1050 2018-01-09 22:50:15 @binance_2017 Please consider adding the feature where you can sort your crypto wallets (Deposits and Withdraws) by BTC Value. Currently you can sort by Name, Available Balance, and Total Balance but the only useful sort I can think of using is by BTC Value.

1059 2018-01-09 22:49:45 They never taught us crypto currencies in my school
1060 2018-01-09 22:49:39 Oh it's for your private sub nvm :)
1061 2018-01-09 22:49:35 @BellaMagnani this means added growth to crypto currency use. GOOD

1065 2018-01-09 22:49:08 Can you post a link to your channel ?
1066 2018-01-09 22:49:08 thank you
1067 2018-01-09 22:49:06 Are you interested in Crypto Currencies?  If so and you have questions, direct message me here.

1070 2018-01-09 22:48:54 What She's sayin' : You help these NOOBs make some bags : THEN they don't want to keep learnin' or listenin' : THIS is why true #crypto BAGGERS have NOTHING to fear : We will always have people to DUMP on : All this "education" in this space : And ppl still want to act dumb 
1071 2018-01-09 22:48:51 Does anyone want to send me trx? They are especially CHEAP. 

If so, please send me a DM.

1072 2018-01-09 22:48:48 Good job Bcash at becoming the black sheep of crypto, even more then before. Roger Ver truly is the Bitcoin Judas.
1073 2018-01-09 22:48:44 Ik ga rijk worden met crypto
1074 2018-01-09 22:48:43 Is the crypto market cap really just reflecting productivity loss in the tech sector from checking blockfolio?
1075 2018-01-09 22:48:39 If you guys need twitter to insure your investment you guys shouldn’t be investing in crypto
1076 2018-01-09 22:48:35 Ethereum looks like it's about to break $1300 are you ready?

1080 2018-01-09 22:48:22 Wabi, Nem, Icon (ICX) & Lisk (LSK)
1081 2018-01-09 22:48:21 it's been more than a week of blockfolio crashes and lag, #get_data it's much a smoother experience. great job @get_data
1082 2018-01-09 22:48:19 Exactly.  Which is why $TRX shouldn't be on the top 10 YET.
1083 2018-01-09 22:48:19 VOlume accelerated on sell off.....near bottom? Not experienced enougth to say this, so correct me if I'm wrong but: ATH was 6-7cents; then the big pump to high twenties happened- so does TA show retrace to 8 cents  as likely, before reversal?
1084 2018-01-09 22:48:19 Moonbeam will just invent his own crypto currency
1085 2018-01-09 22:48:15 Why do you keep changing your DP?

1089 2018-01-09 22:48:10 Thank you. You answered my youtube question in this post
1090 2018-01-09 22:48:09 Yes, I agree about most other coins.  But ether has so many other apps and coins tied to it, that it is actually a valid argument, market cap wise.  Price-wise, not so much.
1091 2018-01-09 22:48:09 Today’s been so busy I haven’t even had a chance to check my crypto account
1092 2018-01-09 22:48:08 I’m a republican when it’s lambo time, and a Democrat when it’s FDIC time #Crypto

1096 2018-01-09 22:47:59 I have personally made alot of money from crypto and currently have stakes in many coins. I'm always searching new coins to not miss the next good coin. So follow up, or DM me for any help. 

#BTC #ETC #trx #tron #XRP #XLM
1097 2018-01-09 22:47:55 But #crypto overwhelmingly distributes the incremental economic surplus it creates to USERS, not investors...how will Kodak actually create shareholder value with this, even with massive scale/adoption?

#trx
1099 2018-01-09 22:47:48 I received a survey from @RobinhoodApp on interest in #cryptocurrency. Would be huge if they integrate crypto into their already impressive commission free platform. #investing #tech
1100 2018-01-09 22:47:45 Do you believe it'll hit it's ath again?

1102 2018-01-09 22:47:42 tron is going away tooo low....
1103 2018-01-09 22:47:37 You know it's going back up ASAP, everyone wants into the ship now.
1104 2018-01-09 22:47:33 I got out 90% of my stake - Put a chunk into $APPC yesterday and some more into $AION - I figure choices like this and $snov are a safer bet and wont move as much
1105 2018-01-09 22:47:29 interesting, but could there be larger forces motivating these changes? the NYSE has applied for a ETF recently, perhaps they have flexed their muscles in joint executive meetings?
1106 2018-01-09 22:47:25 Also $posw @POSWallet
1107 2018-01-09 22:47:24 It's coming back because I set a low buy and it won't leave without me
1108 2018-01-09 22:47:22 Not a fan of either if I'm being honest
1109 2018-01-09 22:47:22 No bro it’s definitely CANN

1111 2018-01-09 22:47:16 TRON down nobody call me.
1112 2018-01-09 22:47:15 #eth doing very well. Seems to have an extremely bright future, huge potential and already top 3 crypto on market cap. On target to break £1k soon, crazy.
1113 2018-01-09 22:47:13 Anyone else watching #startup? 1st season it's about #crypto, 2nd #SilkRoad. Annoyingly unoriginal :( good show though.
1114 2018-01-09 22:47:05 Man you are the best. I had already studied InvestFeed and for me it is a no brainer, I jumped in when coins are still cheap. Thank you so much
1115 2018-01-09 22:47:03 Pick these ones

すごく楽しかったし勝負に負けても悔いはない
1117 2018-01-09 22:47:00 $XRP.X even at these lows I’ve tripled my money ... but hey, if you’re not in yet now is the buy opportunity and you will triple your money too. There’s no way XRP is closing 2018 less than 10$ ... crypto isn’t a bubble till it hits 10 trillion...
1118 2018-01-09 22:46:51 it took me over 3 hours to send  ETH from MyEtherWallet to Binance last night. That never happen to me before. I hope it doesnt turn into another BTC.
1119 2018-01-09 22:46:42 You know you are crypto addicted, dont you? ;)
1120 2018-01-09 22:46:36 Knocking any crypto isn’t helping the community nor the ideas with which the community envision!! It should grow organically with valid information.
1121 2018-01-09 22:46:30 What crypto you buying?
1122 2018-01-09 22:46:27 Kill Poverty. Good One !
1123 2018-01-09 22:46:20 Who the fuck cares buy them both or be a slave to the bank system we need more crypto all that bitchin about who the better crypto
1124 2018-01-09 22:46:07 Indeed! Won't on exchanges thought if they are new...

That always ends bad.
1125 2018-01-09 22:46:04 Side note..... Just pull your wallet into meta mask if you are that worried.

Not only that, make sure the http// is green and secure.

Personally still using MEW as a DNS breach reallt mean shit. Especially coming from ether blue with 0 proof...
1126 2018-01-09 22:46:02 Load it up $trx. it is going to recover strongly.
1127 2018-01-09 22:45:58 Oh Muhafazakar when did you become the world police, "you told" as if your words are worth anything more than air.

1131 2018-01-09 22:45:37 8 out of the top 10 coins (TRX included) has fallen dramatically in the last week. It'll go back up.
1132 2018-01-09 22:45:37 Justin, don't waste your time responding to these clowns You are right, they should not be investing when they neither have faith in the project or a clue how to trade.

$XVG is still less than 24 hours into a several week move up. Please sell now. $XVG triples inside of 3 wks!
1133 2018-01-09 22:45:31 dealing with exchanges is the worst part of crypto, I can't wait for good Decentralized Exchanges to change this 2018 YEAR OF THE DEX
1134 2018-01-09 22:45:27 Directupload will work with Tron maybe its true

1137 2018-01-09 22:45:15 Over the past month Ethereum, which is far superior to Bitcoin, has more than doubled... yet 95% of your crypto conversations are about bitcoin. Its last years technology folks. By mid year, Ethereum will have  bigger market cap than Bitcoin. Wake up.
1138 2018-01-09 22:45:08 Bad Press and lack of understanding by it's XRP holders.

1142 2018-01-09 22:44:52 Yes, I've done it too. I think it's fine in the right context. Though I cringe when the person using "crypto" obviously doesn't know what cryptography is.
1143 2018-01-09 22:44:50 That’s a giveaway!!!!

1145 2018-01-09 22:44:27 They use to say, there are two coins - bitcoin and shitcoin. Couldn’t be any less true now! The world is JUST now learning about some great technology in this booming industry, bitcoin paved the path, but who will take the throne?
1146 2018-01-09 22:44:26 Crypto users are demanding as hell haha we switch from platforms in a matter of days hahaha
1147 2018-01-09 22:44:20 Will you accept crypto?
1148 2018-01-09 22:44:19 maybe, Kodac is having a crypto moment ?

1151 2018-01-09 22:44:12 Lol, yeah, I was thinking that maybe you knew something I didn't.
1152 2018-01-09 22:44:12 Oh because the CIA/FBI has never stepped foot offshore to prosecute those who have "allegedly stolen from their markets. Their existence is for this exact purpose.

Maybe not now, but when the market is big enough, when its enticing enough for them, they will find a way.
1153 2018-01-09 22:44:12 流石にTRX落ちすぎ。この辺で拾ってガチホしとけばええんちゃうか
1154 2018-01-09 22:44:10 Reddit is literally the dumbest place on earth so I'm not surprised. I saw a dude on the crypto sub question what make fiat have value in an apparent attempt to make crypto look better and claim the value of fiat currency is based on something more arbitrary than crypto.

1162 2018-01-09 22:44:00 You think this is dropping fast? Wait until they start shorting it.  The sharks are circling ready for the feast to come.  It seems anyone can offer a crypto. Unregulated and now a fad.  I wouldn't be surprised if North Korea has a few crypto coins laying around.
1163 2018-01-09 22:43:55 @VinnyLingham says Wall Street is coming to Crypto and they have no interest in the motivators that birthed Bitcoin and the Crypto space
1164 2018-01-09 22:43:55 Just give in. Allow yourself to become a crypto.
1165 2018-01-09 22:43:51 I got in around 100 back in May. My first crypto purchase.  Should have bought 100!

1175 2018-01-09 22:43:19 it's already going along his chart if you take a look at his past posts about verge you will see this. He's also been 92% accurate with his predictions.
1176 2018-01-09 22:43:17 FUD and many new people sifting through xrp files.  XRP will become the standard despite the haters, they have too many gov and banking connections in place and let's 've honest the tech and management are top notch. Most outside the crypto community can get behind XRP vs BTC
1177 2018-01-09 22:43:16 Didn't know you were into Crypto Currencies, what are you holding?
1178 2018-01-09 22:43:15 #xlm #xrp #ada #trx all innovative in their own way and suppose to have great futures. Seems like they are all in the red everyday lol somethings not right. I got in early and I’m holding tho. #crypto #news
1179 2018-01-09 22:43:11 that it can only last for 10 years !so thats not good then i feel changes happening for technology and not the currency because the rich guys hold majority of the coins and so little hope for new comers i believe i need some clarification and explain to me how can it be >>>>>

1181 2018-01-09 22:43:09 @effectsToCause Good idea.  The education value of the last podcast with you was worthy of a donation.  Anyone who listened to it most likely invested in $VRC & $VRM and are now benefiting from it.
1182 2018-01-09 22:43:09 I think you mis-read it.
1183 2018-01-09 22:43:08 You mean it wasn't Trump's Russians blasting the diplomats with a sonic ray gun through the walls of a crypto-protected building?  You meant it was like a virus or something?  Maybe Lyme or Dengue?

1215 2018-01-09 22:41:07 This is awesome news! Revolutionary! Great job guys.
1216 2018-01-09 22:41:03 Thank you mark for the reply I am new to crypto I watch crypto coin news all the time just never get in on the right time to make the moves like he does
1217 2018-01-09 22:41:03 I have so many questions about crypto currency I’m tryina get rich lmao
1218 2018-01-09 22:40:56 also, $QLC QLINK has been pumping steady for me since I picked it up less than 48 hours ago. Great project, nice website, just put a product on the Android marketplace this month and has a dedicated marketing team. 
1219 2018-01-09 22:40:55 Apex looks very interesting!
1220 2018-01-09 22:40:55 Did crypto just have it's Kodak moment?
1221 2018-01-09 22:40:54 oooh it is. I saw it many times today tho I wonder why ?
1222 2018-01-09 22:40:52 Meanwhile in my world, it took me over a week to mine $0.70c in Electroneum just to try it out before I got bored. I don't think crypto mining is for me..
1223 2018-01-09 22:40:51 Yeah, agreed -- I mean in principle one could decentralize that too (eg LocalBitcoins is a clumsy version of that) but you'd ultimately need to be able to perform atomic fiat/crypto swaps. I don't _think_ that's entirely out of the question but obviously we're not there yet...
1224 2018-01-09 22:40:44 Hi Ryan, I'm new to crypto and enjoying your tweets. Could you maybe describe how to read the buy and sell wall? Thanks!
1225 2018-01-09 22:40:40 CANN*
1226 2018-01-09 22:40:39 What do you guys think about the new coin that just came on Binance called Appcoins? I think this is a good project and has a lot of growth potential. $APPC Btw Love the video's you guys are making and i watch them all!
1227 2018-01-09 22:40:37 BTW that last shoulder drop in your graph is incorrect. That was created due to the manipulative actions of @CoinMarketCap not real market movement.

1234 2018-01-09 22:40:01 Okay. I don’t believe anything my brother says because he’s always wrong. But I’m scared. Is crypto currency gonna be a thing ?
1235 2018-01-09 22:39:57 My friend wanted to buy some cryptocurrency but he spends all his currency on crypto.

1356 2018-01-09 22:31:55 it has to do with volume and resistance levels. technical analysis of the chart, not of the stock. right now its going through a transition period where it needs to get rid of the people who are not committed to riding out a long wait.
1357 2018-01-09 22:31:42 Avoidance and misdirection so they don’t have to answer the real question? Any questions they are getting about @Ripple or #XRP, they are simply replying with an answer about how you cannot use the card for crypto yet - avoiding the real question about back end functionality.

1406 2018-01-09 22:28:37 Ok, no worries! I’ll do my best to read up on the conical economics texts. But I think you’ll find that crypto in a lot of ways is a hedge against the contrivances of capitalistic economic theories. It is, after all, a system predicated on poverty and exploitation.

1426 2018-01-09 22:27:10 There are some articles about how a crypto crash would hurt stock market.
1427 2018-01-09 22:27:07 I have learned alot over last few days... just holding most of my #alts has made me profit so if you're new to crypto and dont want to trade, just buy and hold. Research those coins you want to hold though, dont run out and buy #BCH
1428 2018-01-09 22:27:04 I think it's safe to say reading charts for long term profits doesn't help anymore. All the speculation with no backing.

- They greed buy again when the price rises.
Try the opposite for a change, see what happens.

Second rule: ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS sell the instant it dips because you have to cut your losses.
Third and final rule: ALWAYS ALWAYS rebuy when it reaches

1496 2018-01-09 22:22:52 Lol meaningless. If you’ve been in crypto you’d know this really is nothing.
1497 2018-01-09 22:22:47 @SkiesOfBlue Ted needs to release a formal PR about their adoption of crypto tech. So IZEA will have the same parabolic run! :)
1498 2018-01-09 22:22:37 Diving a little bit deeper into decentralized exchanges for today's video, especially considering the run 0x and AirSwap are on.
1499 2018-01-09 22:22:36 Fiats role in crypto economics was my primary topic of interest over the past quarter. About 80% of my investments are currently focused on Blockchain market infrastructure and exchanges. #DM me.
1500 2018-01-09 22:22:34 #wsj @cnbc so some 5ucky stocks say they are doing some crypto currency things and get stock price boost,and today #Kodak (old photo play) up 120% from $4 after going krypto and this totally kreepy and krazy (bubbles generally go kaput)
1501 2018-01-09 22:22:32 Should I sell my Tron for clear poll

1512 2018-01-09 22:22:00 Probably fucking Tron/ADA/LTC/ETH honestly. Most of the people still holding out in there are new to crypto and think those are the "next bitcoin". I have a buddy that came in a month ago, that's where his went.
1513 2018-01-09 22:21:56 Is your $BTC balance increasing proportionally to the rate at which it is losing Market Cap Dominance overall ?

1518 2018-01-09 22:21:50 Whether or not these public company pivots to crypto create any long term value, one thing we know right now for certain - these management teams are publicly admitting to having run out of ideas to grow the existing business.

Ripple is halfway between crypto and fiat and not needed, Visa does what ripple does and is faster and more reliable

1546 2018-01-09 22:20:10 Not live yet. Will make it easy to buy crypto with fiat money. Powered by IBM, so probably XLM. But XRP can also benefit from it. 
Most coins could benefit from each other, it's just that here on twitter people seem laser focused on one (or maybe a few) coin(s).

1574 2018-01-09 22:18:26 Is Jamie suggesting that fiat currency is in fact controlled by governments because that’s just a tad misleading. I think he meant to say that he himself will eventually control Crypto...

1605 2018-01-09 22:16:25 Regulatory issues from these flaws will prevent anti-currency in the conventional sense of what is a currency and volatility means insufficient liquidity to realize value, which is a huge problem. EntDLT is what'll remain. Crypto has other advantages just not in current form.

1615 2018-01-09 22:15:49 You can also argue that in those times of cheap FIAT, every scarce asset is a bubble, while in reality, FIAT is dumping.

Also, crypto is required for a few new use cases, but some others uses are not worth much and most people can't assess the legit from the fake.
1616 2018-01-09 22:15:49 Once again, the crypto children have been let loose, running their mouths. First the FUD surrounding MEW to push their own wallet, now digging in to TRX. Well done, really proving your credbility as a professional outfit - fantastic way to build a brand.

1642 2018-01-09 22:14:34 @charltonbrooker what about a black mirror episode about a wealthy man with an extravagant lifestyle because of crypto currency riches (like Bitcoin). But because of the instability of crypto curruncies , he loses it all and is left an insane man lost in the world.
1643 2018-01-09 22:14:30 Not to mention tax season right around the corner.. a lot of that refund money will be pumped into crypto

1650 2018-01-09 22:14:13 Actually writing down my investment strategy for crypto is giving me a lot more confidence and clarity.

It's cementing a lot of thoughts that have been aimlessly littering my brain.

#CryptoCurrency #BTC
1651 2018-01-09 22:14:12 Why would you want a big pump which results in a big dump. Verge will grow in a natural way. Much better.
1652 2018-01-09 22:14:12 Looks awesome 
1653 2018-01-09 22:14:09 Great to hear bro hope to join your group soon!
1654 2018-01-09 22:14:09 so you will be an advisor for this ICO as well?
1655 2018-01-09 22:14:08 Keep up good work guys. Glad we have people like you willing to help out and navigate the crypto world. Much appreciated
1656 2018-01-09 22:14:01 not the crux of my argument as to why it's scammy. I do think I RT'ed that without doing research, and that was wrong, and I feel bad about that, but I don't feel bad for arguing that it's not a good buy. Plenty of free advice available from people making so much for crypto.
1657 2018-01-09 22:14:00 Who said bubble? You can now send $ETH to dogetoken.eth to get 100,000 $DGT plus bonus!

1682 2018-01-09 22:12:43 Can you explain a bit more about mgo, why you so bullish?
1683 2018-01-09 22:12:39 Great how? How is it so much better than other coins?
1684 2018-01-09 22:12:38 what you think about the whitepaper story of trx?
1685 2018-01-09 22:12:33 All the deals I hand craft for brands are only valuable for a limited time - it’s like #crypto if you don’t act fast the price either rises or goes down based off the schedule #sales #magento #brand #brands #branding

1688 2018-01-09 22:12:19 The real bitcoin is bitcoin - If old Roger cared so much about bitcoin he would fix it not fork away from it. I'm pretty sure Satoshi's vision didn't involved a war over who's coin was best, rather than working together to fix it.
1689 2018-01-09 22:12:18 well it seems to me that they're worried about the anonymous nature of crypto.

1720 2018-01-09 22:10:06 LOL the only person you want to follow is @CryptosR_Us he has a dedicated fan base who trust him so much. Last time he spoke about a crypto coin highly it went up 500-600% in a day over 24 hour period not a pump and dump.

If all of his followers trust him, you should.

1723 2018-01-09 22:10:04 Not true...they put out newsletters every month and seems to have a team (8 deep) and already have partners.
1724 2018-01-09 22:10:03 youre mad it's stable? looking for 1000x? you don't belong in crypto.
1725 2018-01-09 22:10:03 Im not daytrading im in it for the long haul. Plus i bought in and just under 5 cents and my portfolio is diversified. No sweat here
1726 2018-01-09 22:10:01 I'm so happy crypto currency exists. Now millennials get to have their very own group of talentless hacks that add 0 value to society control vast swaths of wealth. Really a wonderful revolution that allows us to break free from the economic problems of the past.

1763 2018-01-09 22:07:51 This service is for international transfers/currency exchange (Fiat Currency). It has nothing to do with crypto directly and I never stated it did.

1767 2018-01-09 22:07:36 A quick way would be to put crypto-currency public key QR codes somewhere in the game and have someone scan it through the monitor, if you don't mind crypto payments :)

1774 2018-01-09 22:07:21 Crypto is 24.7 non stop . It takes dedication and hours of research.

1775 2018-01-09 22:07:20 I am not trader. I haven't sold any of the coins I made Head up call. Simply because I choose good coins for both, short and long term.
1776 2018-01-09 22:07:19 a crypto coin you mine by acknowledging the futility of existing.

1778 2018-01-09 22:07:09 I have a linked bank account, its the fees that I cannot tolerate. 
I was holding a good bit of ETH until I sold today, I am not sure how much longer it will rally. taking my profits. It it goes to new high, i will wait for correction then buy again.

1783 2018-01-09 22:07:04 Haha
1784 2018-01-09 22:07:03 So much poor crypto "expertise" information being speed out thereby msm. Just watched Bloomberg. Ughhh!
1785 2018-01-09 22:07:01 What is your opinion on XRP? Do you think at 100 Billion coins created out of thin air is a good thing to do? 

Also, why is XRP valued so much despite not being used? (It is the xConnect being used). Would love to get your opinion. Thanks.
1786 2018-01-09 22:07:01 After I saw your tweet I checked and mine is back in my account, too. I don't know if I should try again with usdt or convert to another crypto and try that way Thanks for the heads up!
1787 2018-01-09 22:07:00 Mr. Dimon is a smart person, but he is a side... bankers side, which see crypto currencies and peer to peer communication without intermediaries a competitor. Consequently judging is predictable.

1798 2018-01-09 22:06:11 For banks I too expect XRP to be the standard. But FairX is an exchange for crypto currency that is coming. 

I like quite a few crypto coins/tokens for what they're doing or planning to do. But all should choose their 'targets'. He who wants all, usually ends up with nothing.

1806 2018-01-09 22:05:52 $Crypto tip of the day: having a profitable alt season.

1) Buy strong alts that are at the bottom of a cycle 

2) Sell partials into $btc when your alts pump 

3) Hold your $btc until it starts another run. The run will cause alts to dip

4) Buy the dips

Rinse and repeat

1820 2018-01-09 22:05:26 we are forgetting that the fed ...can and has retrospectively served those who have committed crimes before they were legislative crimes, they are even more motivated if there is a financial incentive (recovery of fraudulent profits).

3. Say things like have faith and #hodl
4. If up, tweet UFC memes and livestream about your greatness
5. If down, say #DYOR and post disclaimers

Don't be this lame. Buy and hodl $ZRX instead. Faith bros!

1851 2018-01-09 22:01:59 I'm not seeing enough stuff on the Economic Effects Crypto is having on current economics.

With $5 trillion  moving from the old system to the crypto, I am particular interested in what's going to happen.

Current paradigms are going to change drastically. But how??

ideas??
1852 2018-01-09 22:01:50 I will wait until you pump your coin first

1873 2018-01-09 22:01:02 Sounds good, i should probably rebuy then

1909 2018-01-09 21:58:48 Actually that centralized discussion on the web is a big joke since every crypto asset is traded at centralized sites to get money in and out and those sites store their money at banks  Basing on that technology status doesn’t matter anymore

1924 2018-01-09 21:58:20 Yeah, both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are open source, and any changes/imorovement to Bitcoin Core can in theory be merged into Bitcoin Cash fork at any time as well..
1925 2018-01-09 21:58:15 Yep. Weak hands getting taken for a hell of a ride.
1926 2018-01-09 21:58:13 David what Digital Wallet do you use to trade in crypto currency? Have read positive and negative reviews on most including Blockchain, Coinbase and CoinCap. Looking to invest but wary of security of funds.

1933 2018-01-09 21:57:55 There are a few exchanges ahead of them in line.  If PLAY gets listed anywhere else, please let us know.
1934 2018-01-09 21:57:50 @AskRobinhood Are you guys thinking about getting in to the Crypto game? Yesterday I got a survey from you guys, asking about different Cryptos and Crypto Brokerages. Is this on Robinhood's radar?
1935 2018-01-09 21:57:48 You will regret that.
1936 2018-01-09 21:57:37 A lot is working against #crypto #cryptocurrency right now & its all really adjusting to the $100 billion that was lost after Coin Market Cap removed the Korean exchange price for their calculations. Its not just FUD or sellers.A lot of $$ was lost. Be patient.Time is on our side
1937 2018-01-09 21:57:34 @raphaelrehman Any advice for a good crypto to buy now? You said $snov and $zrx in previous tweets but isn´t it already too late? Im new to this and dont really want to lose my bitcoin although I have only 0.002 because of my poorness
1938 2018-01-09 21:57:33 Crypto quiz: What date did the crypto market as a whole, crash last year the worst?
1939 2018-01-09 21:57:29 Just give in and buy a bag of CHC and be like us.
1940 2018-01-09 21:57:16 I wouldn't read the mainstream press for getting up to speed with crypto assets / blockchain. Follow folks like Chris Burniske and twobitidiot to better understand the technology!
1941 2018-01-09 21:57:14 What a coin bone, the worst currency of all  I give them away because they did not work for shit.
1942 2018-01-09 21:57:12 It will peak at .45 and drop to .35 to 37 as the new norm.
1943 2018-01-09 21:57:08 @KodakBlack1k Bro you're getting into crypto? Good for you!
1944 2018-01-09 21:57:05 Tu préconise donc quoi ? Tout garder en crypto en 2018 et attendre 2019 ? A partir de quel volume on envisage la création d'une boite plutôt qu'en AE ?
1945 2018-01-09 21:57:05 Traded this last night
1946 2018-01-09 21:56:59 I like the Kodak crypto coins, but I find that the Ilford crypto coins have a slightly finer grain and the Fuji Pro400H coin does great skin
1947 2018-01-09 21:56:58 @OlegZerehov @QoinPro -warned you guys I would begin trashing you on social media after New Year's if you didn't pay me my BTG...you didn't so now deal with it.  QOINPRO IS A SCAM! DO NOT DEPOSIT YOUR CRYPTO THERE AS THEY WILL SCREW YOU SOONER OR LATER.
1948 2018-01-09 21:56:55 @coinbase Sat on hold for over an hour just to have a human correct a spelling typo the automated ID Verification made.  Unable to help. Tells me to submit the ids again this will be attempt number 3. If it misspells your name you are screwed.

How did crypto change your lifestyle?
1952 2018-01-09 21:56:39 Indeed. I thank God we’re alive to experience it
1953 2018-01-09 21:56:37  I wish!
1954 2018-01-09 21:56:36 If you invested 1k in almost any cryptocurrency a year ago you would've had like a million ;)

1958 2018-01-09 21:56:22 Lmao I crack up when everybody says crypto currency is about to take over  y'all think the Central banking system is gonna let that happen  The Rothschilds, the rockerfellers, the Sorros. Y'all fried  look at Bitcoin . Dropped 13K and hasn't been looking too good
1959 2018-01-09 21:56:22 Irony of trading #crypto on a centralized exchange that can’t handle settlement well, while the main use case of #blockchain is settlement.

1969 2018-01-09 21:55:42 $snov  have been steadily on the up since Saturday.....sold on Sunday, expecting a correction...re-bought today before the breakout.
1970 2018-01-09 21:55:37 Thanks. Crypto is not for the weak stomach by any means, and the minute you lose confidence you end up costing yourself a lot of money. Patience makes money off the impatient. That's why you can't invest with money you are afraid to lose. Seriously
1971 2018-01-09 21:55:37 You really got in early on everything!
1972 2018-01-09 21:55:35 shrugged off that news this morning, sold off on afternoon news they screwed up crypto payments on their own website
1973 2018-01-09 21:55:34 A nice surprise today as #mbrs is enjoying a nice bull run today with news of the upcoming airdrop.still a very undervalued pick in my eyes. Still so much more to come in the future.

1985 2018-01-09 21:55:05 If the blood bath keeps going and a big market correction happens do you see crypto  going down or up with commodities
1986 2018-01-09 21:55:01 Wait you thought he was srs?
1987 2018-01-09 21:55:01 No it will be ripple
1988 2018-01-09 21:54:59 @QoinPro -warned you guys I would begin trashing you on social media after New Year's if you didn't pay me my BTG...you didn't so now deal with it.  QOINPRO IS A SCAM! DO NOT DEPOSIT YOUR CRYPTO THERE AS THEY WILL SCREW YOU SOONER OR LATER.
1989 2018-01-09 21:54:48 Yeah I would say most of my friends are clueless. Probably right around October I got a flood of texts about crypto and it’s been a few WhatsApp groups later. Most haven’t invested in anything ever.
1990 2018-01-09 21:54:41 Between RAM price fixing and crypto currency causing GPUs to skyrocket in price, I got into PC gaming by the skin of my teeth before the cost would have doubled
1991 2018-01-09 21:54:36 I agree that I do have to learn a lot! I think a lot of people that are in crypto's now do! I do not see myself as a trader though, I search for good small cap coins and I invest in them before they surge...
1992 2018-01-09 21:54:32 @QoinPro -warned you guys I would begin trashing you on social media after New Year's if you didn't pay me my BTG...you didn't so now deal with it.  QOINPRO IS A SCAM! DO NOT DEPOSIT YOUR CRYPTO THERE AS THEY WILL SCREW YOU SOONER OR LATER.

1994 2018-01-09 21:54:23 Hello @LedgerHQ how is it possible that a product like the Ledger Nano S in the year 2018 cannot hold more than 5 crypto currencies applications managers at the same time? What is the complexity behind that prevents to have enough storage to all the crypto we need?
1995 2018-01-09 21:54:18 @QoinPro -warned you guys I would begin trashing you on social media after New Year's if you didn't pay me my BTG...you didn't so now deal with it.  QOINPRO IS A SCAM! DO NOT DEPOSIT YOUR CRYPTO THERE AS THEY WILL SCREW YOU SOONER OR LATER.
1996 2018-01-09 21:54:14 Noted!
1997 2018-01-09 21:54:13 I had a feeling a random company would go announcing their own crypto currency.
1998 2018-01-09 21:54:13 It'll be fun watching central banks trying to shove crypto into the box again for some final years. But I agree there's no return to the past.
1999 2018-01-09 21:54:06 If all you talk is crypto currency, it’s a fact you have no personality
2000 2018-01-09 21:54:04 Stocks portfolio & crypto portfolio are both on the up. Fingers crossed it stays that way!
2001 2018-01-09 21:54:03 Cointracking works great but we import from the exchanges. We really like it and it's a BONUS for US taxes. ~Jo

2014 2018-01-09 21:53:04 But how do you call a crypto market which created almost a trillion out of nothing? Without producing anything ? You wouldn’t call this inflation?

2048 2018-01-09 21:50:31 Plot: As cryptos approach $10T a company buys landfills and searches through them for old hard-drives with long lost crypto wallets. The price crashes and they’re left making money off of ID theft and blackmailing you based on personal info on your harddrive

2051 2018-01-09 21:50:20 Currently we conform to a neoliberal, capitalist structure for survival. The problems that plague it make anarcho-capitalism extremely attractive, since crypto fundamentally solves them by allowing anyone to meaningfully acquire capital.

2065 2018-01-09 21:49:31 Will be gone in any Crypto currency wallet by now
2066 2018-01-09 21:49:26 Get used to it... 2018/19 we’ll see floods of big businesses elbowing their way into the ICO space to get a piece of the crypto pie.
2067 2018-01-09 21:49:26 Have you tried coinstats?
2068 2018-01-09 21:49:21 This Crypto world is insane! Some shity little coin called Brother (BRAT) is up 3754% in 24hrs, now @ .0087c Aud 
2069 2018-01-09 21:49:15 Ha, same here!
2070 2018-01-09 21:49:05 Looking forward to the MeetUp Thursday with @wanchainorg Founder and CEO, Jack Lu. #wanchain #Crypto #cryptocurrency #blockchain #austinblockchain
2071 2018-01-09 21:49:03 @KINGCRYPTOCOINS I couldn’t help but notice you’re lacking a logo for your page. I’d like to design one for you, to your specifications of course in exchange for crypto
2072 2018-01-09 21:49:01 I just traded on the @COBINHOOD exchange site. I was inlove with everything about it except for the slow processing after an order was placed. Every second counts when your in a high volume trade!
2073 2018-01-09 21:48:57 Need to start putting "crypto" or "blockchain" into vuln reports
2074 2018-01-09 21:48:53 Started using Etherdelta with Metamask to buy some tokens. The worst usability I've ever seen on a crypto exchange.
2075 2018-01-09 21:48:49 Same lol 
2076 2018-01-09 21:48:33 $PROC Low marketcap...this is worth a look. DYOR. Just filled my bags #crypto #kucoin $btc
2077 2018-01-09 21:48:24 Predicting crypto since 2016 is like predicting that the sun will shine on the next day....
2078 2018-01-09 21:48:18 I believe in this very interesting project #Crypto #Blockchain #Crowdfunding #SyncFab
2079 2018-01-09 21:48:14 I think that stable coins are vital for the transition to crypto (like the newly issued DAI  from MAKER). Still in very early stage.
2080 2018-01-09 21:48:13 I moved from $blockfolio to #delta anyone makes a dapp for crypto folio and I'm on that ICO this is getting serious AF Speed is the name of the game

2085 2018-01-09 21:47:56 250-500 is nothing in a year. don't forget, crypto market is also growing. 

I couldn't really predict what the price will be, but if all goes well and they get to top 20 in market cap, the growth will be huge. marketing is key.
2086 2018-01-09 21:47:56 Think you sold it once it passed/crossed the $1.00 threshold, and actually topped out/max for the 29th @ $1.18. Good call Young & Investing! I don't know if that was the methodology. Also read 50% of your portfolio was held in that, so you wanted to a diversify & sold of 30%!
2087 2018-01-09 21:47:34 It will be interesting to see how the crypto market has evolved. Used to be alts went down when BTC went up, now it’s not so clear.
2088 2018-01-09 21:47:32 Moving on up!  Had to start a new twitter because the fam and friends wouldn't stop yelling that I talked about #Crypto too much... Sucks all my friends and family are going ot be broke!
2089 2018-01-09 21:47:30 Hold. Take a look at ETH and BTC between 21/12/17 and 22/12/17 and look at ETH now. You're in a good spot, you have nothing to lose, be patient and wait.
2090 2018-01-09 21:47:24 Does pro have any upgrades that make it worth getting?
2091 2018-01-09 21:47:24 260k and moon sir
2092 2018-01-09 21:47:22 False, bit coin had something to offer that literally changed the world, XVG is a privacy coin with the features of 100 other privacy coins, and fanboys that went 3x for the first time, the $XVG community are the Jake Paulers of crypto and forgive it for fucking up consistently
2093 2018-01-09 21:47:18 @deruiter7 
Hey, I saw you were having a crypto currency giveaway, so I thought I’d message you with an offer. I couldn’t help but notice you’re lacking a logo for your page. I’d like to design one for you, to your specifications of course...

2096 2018-01-09 21:46:56 It looks like there will be a 20m cap, and a follow-up sale in 2019, have a feeling the follow-up sale will dampen prices during the year
2097 2018-01-09 21:46:54 Bought at 380 and staked already 
2098 2018-01-09 21:46:43 Congratulation to @swissborg for have reached the hardcap of ICO. 50M$. See you on HitBTC soon. #cryptocurrency #crypto #ICO
2099 2018-01-09 21:46:40 My twitter feed is utterly confusing. It's the clash of Black Twitter, Crypto, and Track and Field.
2100 2018-01-09 21:46:31 There is a lot of hype around coins like $ICX and $ADA and all that but don‘t forget the hidden gems folks.

One I can give you rightnow is @Sophia_TX_ $SPHTX

Completely undervalued and massive potential!

2101 2018-01-09 21:46:25 everyone is new to crypto
2102 2018-01-09 21:46:24 The more they ban crypto the more it makes me want to invest in it.
2103 2018-01-09 21:46:14 Delta by a mile.  Check their blog for what's coming next. @get_delta is the best tracking app I've used so far, way more accurate than Blockfolio from what I've noticed.

2106 2018-01-09 21:45:56 App developer economics through iOS seem like an interesting parallel to the mining ecosystem in crypto. Multi-billion dollar industry that didn't exist 10 years ago but is now uniquely enabled by new technology
2107 2018-01-09 21:45:55 Crypto-currency what what still confuses me bro.

2114 2018-01-09 21:45:22 So if we can get rid of Stephen Miller next does that mean we've banished crypto-fascism from the White House?
2115 2018-01-09 21:45:11 2/2 Crypto regulation is good. It’ll legitimize this market and ready it for institutional asset flows.

Go follow @BigCheds @davidgokhshtein @Flex__Trades  because they actually know things.

2120 2018-01-09 21:44:37 #ICOAcornCollective well, a free crowdfunding platform is always useful

2123 2018-01-09 21:44:20 Could Bitcoin become the official Canadian crypto 
2124 2018-01-09 21:44:18 B3 has one of the most transparent and active communities in crypto. And I didn’t put $50 into either of those.
2125 2018-01-09 21:44:13 People keep forgetting we’re talking about crypto

2130 2018-01-09 21:43:52 How's OST looking?
2131 2018-01-09 21:43:50 That is seconds ago
2132 2018-01-09 21:43:48 how would you think about $150M in $KODK market cap relative to crypto "market caps"? seems like $150M market cap for a token with a strong brand name and believable use case would almost be "cheap" looking at current CMC rankings!
2133 2018-01-09 21:43:43 Going to venture out and start exploring crypto investments... famous last words
2134 2018-01-09 21:43:38 So bad. I can’t do anything other than crypto lol. I’m gonna try to meditate or something haha
2135 2018-01-09 21:43:35 What’s the best crypto news to follow? @iambroots
2136 2018-01-09 21:43:30 I’m on Delta. Works fine
2137 2018-01-09 21:43:24 
2138 2018-01-09 21:43:24 you have to have full global consensus though. even if one off-shore country is left, they will continue doing this. crypto doesn't need a certain place. CFTC is a US agency, it won't have jurisdiction for example in Russia or actually in any foreign country that won't play ball

2142 2018-01-09 21:43:19 100 JPY(BTC): 1271.553 ~ 1277.456 KRW(BTC)
2143 2018-01-09 21:43:15 Curious as to why some are so big on ETC; is it clearly superior to ETH? 

5 years from now which one comes out on top?
2144 2018-01-09 21:43:02 Crypto currency is a mystery to me. Is this tulips in Holland or something of true value?
2145 2018-01-09 21:43:00 1/1 The entire crypto echo system screams regulation, especially ICOs and uniform rules for coin exchanges.
2146 2018-01-09 21:42:51 Way to go. Get some tokens today to enjoy the crypto boom.
2147 2018-01-09 21:42:49 Trading securities is fun, but it is hard and there are rules. Trading crypto is also fun, and it is easy and there are no rules. I suspect this fun is a major factor in the persistence of crypto prices. If crypto still baffles you, consider the engagement rate of fun videogames.
2148 2018-01-09 21:42:48 They're probably creating some kind of visualization/data mapping tool to attempt to cluster wallets together. Crazy. Privacy is going to be huge this year.
2149 2018-01-09 21:42:46 Its a triangle, going to pop anytime soon.

2159 2018-01-09 21:41:49 If crypto people knew the value they will be getting from this account, they would have wished I was born before Satoshi himself $BTC $ETH
2160 2018-01-09 21:41:47 The best advice I can give to any devs curious about #crypto is this: Focus on the fundamentals of the technology. Learn how it *works*. Resist the trading FOMO. Invest in yourself, not the latest shitcoin. Long term goals, not short term highs.
2161 2018-01-09 21:41:30 Unfortunately the system teaches panic selling, and many in the crypto community are graduates of said system. Sadly crypto are meant as a tool of liberation!
2162 2018-01-09 21:41:27 Crypto is the way to go in this time and tokens are a great way to make more money. Everyone should get some tokens for prosperity.
2163 2018-01-09 21:41:23 I really don't understand crypto currency, and this certainly isn't helping.
2164 2018-01-09 21:41:23 Crypto is crypy
2165 2018-01-09 21:41:15 Goon on you John. I admire your success and persistence. I'm hearing good things about the crypto Ripple. Are you on that?
2166 2018-01-09 21:41:12 Ive been trying to get on @binance_2017  at least 5 times a day and I have nothing. 
2167 2018-01-09 21:41:12 #TRON #TRX is expected to breakout soon... Buying in doesn't look a bad option...
Invest at your own risk though
2168 2018-01-09 21:41:07 Weak hands get shaken. #HodlGang
2169 2018-01-09 21:40:48 Excited to see this happen, but have yet to encounter anyone who's actually placed a trade with COBINHOOD... 

Makes me wonder just what the timeframe is to HODL w/ #TRX ...
2170 2018-01-09 21:40:45 well.. i made a fresh salad today with every kind of vegetable growing up on this lil earth!
someone should make an ICO out of it. $crypto
2171 2018-01-09 21:40:38 love the *this is not a scam* part
2172 2018-01-09 21:40:37 one of the crypto i had on the list to invest but ran out of cash :(. Very nice call though, I do remember you calling it. you da baws
2173 2018-01-09 21:40:32 How long u been in crypto
2174 2018-01-09 21:40:32 Yes, it is an opportunity. If you haven't made money in crypto you won't understand. #XRP is here to stay for long. It is time to utilize this opportunity.
2175 2018-01-09 21:40:30 @AlexanderNL waarom shill jij niet af en toe een coin? Die je uiteraard eerst zelf al in je gestopt hebt?? Je hebt ook een aardig bereik. Ik zie een nieuwe uitdaging voor je!? #crypto

2195 2018-01-09 21:39:01 Hell yeah

2204 2018-01-09 21:38:03 I don’t see how day trading crypto could ever make you as much money as buying Great Undervalued Coins and HOLDING!

Want to get involved in crypto or have a question, Tweet Me @KnightsofCrypto
2205 2018-01-09 21:37:53 As much as I want the solution to be crypto mining, that's a bit of a stretch. The article points to the real solutions: 1st, build a transmission line to USA and sell the excess energy to them. 2nd, attract large businesses (like Facebook) to establish a presence in Canada.
2206 2018-01-09 21:37:53 Mine just sends me graphs of ETH and asks if it is 'good to buy now?'

2207 2018-01-09 21:37:51 I was checking the coin when you called it and I told myself pfff that Savigny why is he recommending a dead shitcoin. Now I know why. Never doubting again
2208 2018-01-09 21:37:50 Lou, I'm writing a blog post about last night's event. Can you share a few thoughts on why Crypto Monday has caught on so quickly?  What was your biggest takeaway from last night?  What will be the biggest benefit to the NYC crypto community? 
Thanks,
Craig
2209 2018-01-09 21:37:49 Just keeps chugging along. Took a while to recover from plummeting when it was initially listed which feels like a fuckinf life time ago...5 months feels like 5 years in crypto time
2210 2018-01-09 21:37:42 Good call
2211 2018-01-09 21:37:25 I remember chatting with @feross about how annoying the shorthand "crypto" was for blockchain/tokens. Now I catch myself using it and feel ashamed.
2212 2018-01-09 21:37:22 Actually it is evidence that it is hard to get fiat currency out of Korea, so exchanges there are short on crypto supply.

bad tech + scams could produce fortunes 4 months or years??

2228 2018-01-09 21:36:22 @JChatterleyBBG | why not allow casual day traders to allow the syphoning off of some BTC when traded to their chosen charities or useful investment outlets, presumably the crypto currencies provide an alternative (retail) signal to small businesses when compared to high finance

2263 2018-01-09 21:34:31 Hey, I saw you were having a crypto currency giveaway, so I thought I’d message you with an offer. I couldn’t help but notice you’re lacking a logo for your page. I’d like to design one for you in exchange for some crypto.
2264 2018-01-09 21:34:22 Hes just shilling to get ppl into crypto for the happiness of all of us

2271 2018-01-09 21:33:52 Crypto-mining electricity is a negligible factor compared to the oil used to manufacture consumer products and drive hordes of millions of cars; all the methane gas pipes that leak constantly; and people that are still devouring cows every day.

But yeah uh, darn bitcoin miners
2272 2018-01-09 21:33:50 Yes, still possible of course. But a lot harder from an entry at $20+ million cap rather than $5 million cap $ZER
2273 2018-01-09 21:33:46 Making a killing % wise over on Craptopia, keep rolling into the next coin, so far have x3 $IFT & $ODN. Got some $RAIN earlier now that’s starting to pump. It’s a bull market and I’m not a genius!!

2282 2018-01-09 21:33:00 I believe in this very interesting project  #Crypto #Blockchain #Crowdfunding #JoyToken
2283 2018-01-09 21:32:58 #TRON #TRX is going to be on the move soon.
2284 2018-01-09 21:32:57 I'm interested what traditional portfolio risk measures you recommend for crypto? Anything that assumes normal distribution should be thrown out the window.
2285 2018-01-09 21:32:56 I'm sorry friend but there are far too many scams out there to believe your story. But if you look at the #etn wallet they are going to offer a mobile miner that allows you to earn ETN by simulated mining. It is designed for people like you also in mind
2286 2018-01-09 21:32:47 Could we make a glib remark-based crypto-currency? I guess we could just base any sort of transactional unit on any other ephemeral thing and call it good...
2287 2018-01-09 21:32:43 Wish I had more liquidity.  @Coinbase is a joke.  I've been waiting since 1/1 for funds to clear.  My bank took the money out of my account on 1/3.  Contacted customer support and havent heard anything back.
2288 2018-01-09 21:32:41 What is the point of crypto companies to have Telegram channels ?

This is no effective form of communication, having in some cases hundreds of messages per hour in dozens of topics in one screen...

2351 2018-01-09 21:28:31 I am not TA guy, but as i see simple charts work the best for crypto
2352 2018-01-09 21:28:31 Ok Crypto-currency support scams are hilarious
2353 2018-01-09 21:28:26 I'm ready  I even have my umbrella 
2354 2018-01-09 21:28:23 What is the best way to transfer from fiat to crypto bridge account?
2355 2018-01-09 21:28:22 I've only used it once really so no complaints. I can't really compare it to any others though to know if its the best etc. I'm not big time crypto trader so it'll probably do for my needs. I think most of them have the horror stories online so none are perfect.
2356 2018-01-09 21:28:21 This is no market dip lol the market is on a bull run . Clearly you have not seen a real market dip in crypto yet
2357 2018-01-09 21:28:19 Tremenda Ridiculez la de todos ustedes... Son todos unos CRYPTO balurdos!!!
2358 2018-01-09 21:28:17 Since i switched i haven't had a single problem, used blockfolio before. looks good - doesn't work, smartass 
2359 2018-01-09 21:28:14 Welcome to China. Plagiarism is embraced. Maybe you're too good for this type of money.
2360 2018-01-09 21:28:12 Sell your ZRX if you hate money
2361 2018-01-09 21:28:11 100 JPY(BTC): 1272.013 ~ 1275.555 KRW(BTC)
2362 2018-01-09 21:28:09 So true, had a fake 300 percent increase, looked like i made 1500 off a 500 dollar investment i made an hour before xD
2363 2018-01-09 21:28:05 So out of the entire thing, thats what you've found? Is that even your screenshot or a copy and paste from an article? But I'm the retard?
2364 2018-01-09 21:27:58 Was at a party in Saturday night and I could overhear people asking "are u long crypto?" Reminded me of spring 1999 in NYC bars often asking "Qualcomm or Cisco?"
2365 2018-01-09 21:27:56 But how do you enter your previous data? 
2366 2018-01-09 21:27:53 Things I look for: use case, differentiators, dev team, mission, roadmap, updates, historical data, price charts and competitors. There’s a lot of crap coins out there’s and it’s up to use to get out the crap. #Blockchain #crypto #xrp #btc #ltc #ada #trx
2367 2018-01-09 21:27:49 I don’t understand how?
2368 2018-01-09 21:27:46 Please I beg thee
2369 2018-01-09 21:27:45 Did you ever get round to creating the crypto loans platform? What happened to my coins mine on your pool several days no coins this was in your second week of launch
2370 2018-01-09 21:27:41 $RAIN was great in 2017, can't be wrong that season ;-)
2371 2018-01-09 21:27:39 LOL, I know, I am just humbly suggesting an additional piece to address it, as we are entering 2017 filing season and the number of US-based crypto investors exploded in 2017, many of them engaging in crypto currency exchanges
2372 2018-01-09 21:27:38 Just another in $crypto Twitter

2376 2018-01-09 21:27:14 Now we see how good #ethereum #eth really is. My node can’t keep up any more and it is not the slowest one on earth #Crypto
2377 2018-01-09 21:27:10 good choice, delta is much better!
2378 2018-01-09 21:27:10 Actually the lead dev mentioned in a tweet not too log ago that it was 2 million+. Not sure why BitScreener and dev are discrepant.  $zer
2379 2018-01-09 21:27:09 $ETC ready to go finally? I hope so :) The only one coin  which still has a lot of room (from old school crypto ;)).
2380 2018-01-09 21:27:07 we shall all meet in Amsterdam
2381 2018-01-09 21:27:04 Agreed

2387 2018-01-09 21:26:40 Fuck thats a good one I regretted not getting it last season
2388 2018-01-09 21:26:35 I cut my day job hours back a lot because of crypto. Protecting and expanding my crypto wealth is a fulltime job now basically for now at least. Still super busy though. Now I have enough energy to run and lift every day too 
2389 2018-01-09 21:26:28 CONFESSIONS OF A CRYPTO NOOB #1:
I joined a pump group this weekend. It didn't work out for me. Now, obviously they *can* benefit some people (esp if you're an admin), and they *can* raise interest in sleepy coins, but.... nah. Gonna take a bath and play it straight now.

2399 2018-01-09 21:25:53 Also switched over to Delta @get_delta a week ago... Blockfolio is starting to disappoint!
I gotta say, Delta does a great job!
But because of my small bags, i don't get heart attacks when it dips a bit ;)

2410 2018-01-09 21:25:08 Looking at the  #crypto #coins ranking from 40-50, 80% had a huge gain in the last 24 hours ! Too risky invest more into these coins on a daily trade?
2411 2018-01-09 21:24:53 thanks to $ETH hitting a steady 1200, I just sold 1 and recouped all the money I put into crypto last year. woo timid investing!

2413 2018-01-09 21:24:36 @realKrisCruz what was the name of the crypto currency system you and doc use
2414 2018-01-09 21:24:35 Hmm  verkopen i guess
2415 2018-01-09 21:24:33 Delta has been working like a charm since i switched 4/5 days ago :)
2416 2018-01-09 21:24:33 Pleb, only 3 pair of socks
2417 2018-01-09 21:24:29 What other road trip would you recommend instead?
2418 2018-01-09 21:24:29 Haha seat belts are tight
2419 2018-01-09 21:24:28 Crypto and weed are both down. Time to sell sell sell 
2420 2018-01-09 21:24:25 it is okish but not half as good as it should be
2421 2018-01-09 21:24:22 C’est ce que je pense aussi et oui je pense au projet à moyen terme pas au long . Merci
2422 2018-01-09 21:24:21 scammers, get out of crypto
2423 2018-01-09 21:24:20 One thing that gives me hope is that people moved from talking about just the prices to mining. $crypto
2424 2018-01-09 21:24:16 Gravychain vindt ik het beste werken, alleen geen alerts
2425 2018-01-09 21:24:10 Delta is great.
2426 2018-01-09 21:24:01 I  see #tron
2427 2018-01-09 21:23:57 Seeing my bags drop sucks but gotta remember crypto is a wild ride
2428 2018-01-09 21:23:54 #AST.   Kodak +120% today because of:
blockchain, crypto
Photocentric Kodakcoin
They have just chucked some words together and the share price has doubled.  It is brilliant. CH issue something like ASToCOIN and we’ll finally be off to the races. Cyrptos gone mad
2429 2018-01-09 21:23:51 BREAKING: @JeremyStockton_ Crypto Kings has sold all his shares of of BLANGUM Currency and is currently losing share value. The Bullish Market says hold but this seems to be a bearish trend!
2430 2018-01-09 21:23:44 Are you expecting in btc another dip soon Crypto? Thank you!

2433 2018-01-09 21:23:28 No. But when @WolfOfPoloniex did the “get out of all crypto markets” last summer i wish i did lol. But I think the market has changed
2434 2018-01-09 21:23:28 I like coin stats myself rarely has issues
2435 2018-01-09 21:23:28 Guess it's waiting for tomorrow
2436 2018-01-09 21:23:28 I already researched a bit, most things are possible as long as $.
2437 2018-01-09 21:23:07 Bought $10 worth of #ETC about a month ago, now at $25.

Please only put money into #Crypto if you are ok with losing it. Sure I got 2x what I put in, but no one knows if it will drop and be worth nothing one day. Don't use me an an example, I'm just some 18 year old.
2438 2018-01-09 21:23:06 Yo! Hit me up when you are in San Deigo my man!
2439 2018-01-09 21:23:06 What if..... what if all this time my portfolio ain’t worth shit and blockfolio fuckin around?!?!!
2440 2018-01-09 21:22:58 $MOD?
2441 2018-01-09 21:22:52 Using Delta now and pretty satisfied, especially with alerts. You can try CoinManager for portfolio diversity
2442 2018-01-09 21:22:51 Anyone else in the crypto game ?
2443 2018-01-09 21:22:48 Very professional done, no hype and usual crypto craze. That’s what I call solid product!

2450 2018-01-09 21:22:36 Yo have fun man
2451 2018-01-09 21:22:27 Not enough imho they have two "flagship" ICO's to launch their ICO platform. Compare that to other platforms like ADA and NEO both made major moves before any ICO was ever to be launched.
2452 2018-01-09 21:22:23 私の聖地w
2453 2018-01-09 21:22:23 Dude amsterdam
2454 2018-01-09 21:22:20 Scalp at 20% meaning you would (as an example) sell 85% of your bag when it's up 20%? Isn't that a lot?
2455 2018-01-09 21:22:09 I was a quiet trader till Nov 2017.

I now spend essentially 18 hours a day looking at #cryptocurrency 

There is so much information to help you make right decisions, being in #crypto is a LIFETIME job. Do your due diligence people, the market isnt as unpredictable as you think
2456 2018-01-09 21:22:07 right on that. i'm hoping they use alot of these platforms to do it
2457 2018-01-09 21:22:04 Not a good time, firms just pulled crypto ETFs at the warning of the SEC, expect crypto values to drop a bit more until fears of govt and institution meddling fade.
2458 2018-01-09 21:22:03 are you sure this is legit? there are ALOT these that are fake. becareful
2459 2018-01-09 21:22:01 Way better
2460 2018-01-09 21:22:01 Let's hope so 
2461 2018-01-09 21:21:56 Yes but hold. This is expected to become big in 2018.
2462 2018-01-09 21:21:55 
2463 2018-01-09 21:21:50 I switched to Delta last week.  Took A LONG TIME to put my transactions in but I think it's a better app.
2464 2018-01-09 21:21:48 Should have a look at the CryptoInsight desktop app.
2465 2018-01-09 21:21:46 That’s the mentality!
2466 2018-01-09 21:21:46 This isn't even a real competition... Tesla All Day but get the one with the nice rims
2467 2018-01-09 21:21:41 I mean, they do rent out cars for gumball, so I'm sure it's possible.

2471 2018-01-09 21:21:33 not the best road tripping car and most rental agencies charge steep fees in you drive luxury cars over 75 miles. Just something to consider.
2472 2018-01-09 21:21:33 741 worth of btc to be precise
2473 2018-01-09 21:21:29 Shit day for me in crypto. #goodnight
2474 2018-01-09 21:21:27 change it to "buy" and it seems realistic.
2475 2018-01-09 21:21:21 Why not?
2476 2018-01-09 21:21:21 Perfect time to buy #trx in a couple of days it going to the moon might hit 60¢. #notFinancialadvice #trx #tron $trx #ToTheMoon #buy #crypto #cryptocurrency #alts
2477 2018-01-09 21:21:19 Ouch. That’s a bad day. Must admit I refuse to trade crypto currencies but the volatility is crazy
2478 2018-01-09 21:21:17 Agree. Same is true for FCT #factom #Cryptocurreny
2479 2018-01-09 21:21:16 After 48 hours of research and technical analysis, I am predicting that $BAT will be $20 by end of 2018. I will eat my dick if it doesn't reach $20. $BAT will be really huge in 2018 and you will see that in upcoming months. #BAT #BasicAttentionToken #crypto #bitcoin #BTC #altcoin

2485 2018-01-09 21:20:53 looking like it's on it way back towards that BTC high of 2014...
2486 2018-01-09 21:20:52 I have met my initial crypto goal for Dec. 6, 2018. Now, to figure out how to report this on my taxes.
2487 2018-01-09 21:20:49 Thank you for the answer, how scared are you of a BTC repeat with full blocks causing market share loss in this case? Waiting 10-12mo with full blocks assuming no other scaling solution is found. (Probably worse than btc because of the pace of crypto atm) No FUD, I only have ETH.
2488 2018-01-09 21:20:47 Trump lost when he dealt with Saudi's just like Obama and Hillary would have, when he failed to secure the first amendment rights of the memers who created him, when he stopped trying to fix immigration (wall is not enough), and the final nail when he fucked the crypto traders.

2490 2018-01-09 21:20:31 No, you wil get in line behind the 760 btc orders for 0.0000002 that are still open for sale  ps, price is now stabel at 0.00000001....but look at the other sales orders as well. People are waiting for a mistake
2491 2018-01-09 21:20:27 What are siloed coins?
2492 2018-01-09 21:20:22 Back to reading then! Started to feel like I wasn't learning much by just skimming the coin people are shilling on a day-by-day basis.
2493 2018-01-09 21:20:19 I see 10k Bitcoin...
2494 2018-01-09 21:20:12 To buy 1 #Litecoin, you'd need to trade 1,010.00 Wendys chicken nuggets! #crypto #nuggets #WENDcoin
2495 2018-01-09 21:20:08 Meh. He’ll probably try to dare North Korea into creating their own crypto 
2496 2018-01-09 21:20:06 I don’t think it matters I think this big move is insiders taking advantage of the crypto craze they loaded up before the press release and now they’ll dump their shares I wouldn’t be surprised if Kodak does some toxic financing’s
2497 2018-01-09 21:20:01 where my crypto ladies at
2498 2018-01-09 21:19:59 Akira: I don’t know about this crypto-currency scheme, Ryo. This doesn’t even have anything to do with hunting demons.
2499 2018-01-09 21:19:52 remember.  There is no competition.  UPF is available to all, just that PIVX seems to be the only blockchain project to have embraced and implemented what the community wanted and built.

2505 2018-01-09 21:19:34 If everything goes well, I'm thinking of renting a Lambo Huracan for a few days to drive from Seattle all the way to Cali / San Diego. We'll see. I might only visit The States in Feb or March tho.
2506 2018-01-09 21:19:34 That was such a good call! You'll have to come and tell your story if it makes you $1m! How's #TRXDogs for you? I tried #cryptokitties but the fees and network delays were so annoying I gave up
2507 2018-01-09 21:19:28 My intentions in crypto is both to back some interesting projects in order to support the decentralized internet, but also to take profit along the way and not just sitting on a ICO before its actual dev. starts.
I've decided to back out of $trx despite hyping it quite a bit. 1/2
2508 2018-01-09 21:19:20 Given the absurdly high environmental impact of crypto-currencies, a #BasicIncome funded by the taxation of crypto-transfers would be socially, economically and ecologically logical.
2509 2018-01-09 21:19:18 Can't get btc values to work on Delta..
2510 2018-01-09 21:19:17 Congratulations 
2511 2018-01-09 21:19:17 It's a beautiful day in the crypto-world! it's a great time to buy, especially since the market is experience a huge correction after its phenomenal bull run last week. #buyitup #crypto #tron #gvt #xlm #kin
2512 2018-01-09 21:19:15 Idiots playing crypto like its the casino, they're selling because they have sold all their assets and put it here so any time it drops they get scared.. so lame. All the money I put in,In my head I already lost it that way I don't panic sell so jokes on them no stress for me lol
2513 2018-01-09 21:19:14 Noticed the same thing.
2514 2018-01-09 21:19:14 both, the second 1 will help you understand the first better. But basic TA is absolutely the first place you should start.
2515 2018-01-09 21:19:07 Aaaaaannnnnddd... Canada is cold AF most of the time. Great for cooling.

2516 2018-01-09 21:19:03 Thanks if I win will send address
2517 2018-01-09 21:19:00 Delta is beter!
2518 2018-01-09 21:18:57 Here is your hammer  because those walls are smashing the buys down come on crack on with the hammer no time for tweeting 
2519 2018-01-09 21:18:53 Well I've been involved with $VRC since 2014.....
2520 2018-01-09 21:18:49 Hmmmm
2521 2018-01-09 21:18:49 Wow
2522 2018-01-09 21:18:39 I have very bad experience with Blockfolio. Most of the times Server is not responding!
2523 2018-01-09 21:18:30 Basically what I've been doing. I take it that I am selling to early in this current bull market if I'm up on just about every trade?
2524 2018-01-09 21:18:21 SURPRISE. When you engage in crypto-fascism it's all fun and games when you're sticking it to "the left," but guess what? Eventually it's going to turn back on you. And now it has.
2525 2018-01-09 21:18:13 It’s a shame you Enron boys aren’t around.
This crypto nonsense is right up your alley 
2526 2018-01-09 21:18:04 Me 2k...

2535 2018-01-09 21:17:37 Yo @officialmcafee you suck at investing and youre a meme, pls leave crypto
2536 2018-01-09 21:17:34 What's better for a beginner to crypto trading:
- follow good traders on Twitter and watch what they post
- ignore Twitter noise and learn trading basics + start doing it
- a mix of both

For @Crypto_Vations and @RogueDarren but anyone can weigh in!
2537 2018-01-09 21:17:32 No, I really think he meant "jeans". They are clearly too tight and cutting off blood circulation affecting the brother's ability to think clearly
2538 2018-01-09 21:17:28 People like Jamie Dimon don’t admit to mistakes. This is a calculated statement. I’m not sure of his reasoning. But don’t be fooled, this has nothing to do with getting the crypto community off his back. His scaly hide is quite thick and slippery.
2539 2018-01-09 21:17:19 $VTC accumulation period continuing. Could be bouncing off the bottom support, or forming a ‘falling 3’s’ If its the later, I’ll #btfd
2540 2018-01-09 21:17:17 Confused as to why Daniel is talking about crypto currencies and criticising sexual abusers in the group chat

2542 2018-01-09 21:17:06 Why fight the trend. Buy $omg where all the siloed coins will be traded
2543 2018-01-09 21:17:04 They are controlling the crypto population to create scarcity
!!!
2544 2018-01-09 21:17:00 And the decentralization??!! It's a money maker for now and then?!! U r losing the goal of the crypto currency...
2545 2018-01-09 21:16:59 Thanks Secrets
2546 2018-01-09 21:16:59 chart looks awesome - you like it more that $PIRL?
2547 2018-01-09 21:16:59 How crypto might allow for the possability of default and how it might emulate a sophisticated banking system in this respect is a worth discussion
2548 2018-01-09 21:16:55 You know what’s crazy? All these major trading sites are having problems keeping up with the demand of new users, trades, buying/selling, keeping exchanges running. Just comes to show how big crypto currencies are getting, just wait until these sites are improved for more ppl
2549 2018-01-09 21:16:52 got same problems. Delta works fine
2550 2018-01-09 21:16:46 delta is better

2555 2018-01-09 21:16:41 Yup, past hour it seemed to be pulling old values from Binance API at least. Wouldn't be too surprised if it was Binance's fault somehow
2556 2018-01-09 21:16:40 Hahaha  people have to ask me to do stuff like three times before I remember to do it. 
2557 2018-01-09 21:16:37 I want to win some Crypto@TeamJRBusiness
2558 2018-01-09 21:16:33 Delta is more ergonomic, easier to use, but i think that if every switch to delta, the app performance will also be impacted
2559 2018-01-09 21:16:33 Which site or app is best to trade altcoins already bought to a setting which predict when to sell or hold a coin pls?
2560 2018-01-09 21:16:31 ik kan mezelf pas crypto investor noemen als ik min eerste grote aankoop ermee kan doen a la auto , huis , autohuis, huispark,  woonwijk
2561 2018-01-09 21:16:29 NOW is a GRATE time to buy TRON... @Tronfoundation 
I would buy millions if I had the money !! @justinsuntron is STILL on of the smartest guys out there and the Tron tec. is unbeatable.
2562 2018-01-09 21:16:27 Lost over 3500 on the crypto today Tbf I have seen a 5800% return up until now
2563 2018-01-09 21:16:27 13zjxDRTN51XM1J7TGEEChmXdtQZs1aroK

Favourite coin has to be $ADA. 

The first alt coin I bought and it has been very good to me so far. Relatively new to crypto but a fun ride so far.

Thank you for the giveaway Dustin. All the best!

2568 2018-01-09 21:15:58 Me telling my friends about crypto ( them ) sounds like a ponzi scheme.  They would rather rent their time to companys for low pay.
2569 2018-01-09 21:15:51 There's a joke in here about proof-of-value in crypto tokens or souls and then something about a bubble, I'm sure of it.
2570 2018-01-09 21:15:51 Gebruik Delta - crypto portofolio - is wel stabiel

2585 2018-01-09 21:14:52 Is that one or the other or would you advise selling some at 20% and more at 50%?
2586 2018-01-09 21:14:52 Delta is on another level and that GUI is 
2587 2018-01-09 21:14:51 no
2588 2018-01-09 21:14:47 delta way better - u can specify pairings for trades ETH/ETC etc and even put in fees! try it ull never go back to blockfolio
2589 2018-01-09 21:14:39 are you saying partnership will be announced in 2 hours or 2 hours after the announcment on the 14th it will sky rocket
2590 2018-01-09 21:14:33 I tried BitUniverse today @Crypto_Ed_NL . Works nice so far, can import holdings via API to exchanges. No Kucoin yet but Binance Bittrex import works fine!

2599 2018-01-09 21:13:54 It's going to boom more
2600 2018-01-09 21:13:43 Where is NEO headed, looks like straight past the moon recently. Interesting to see in 6-12 months where it is.
2601 2018-01-09 21:13:43 Will see some effect on Lend too you think?
2602 2018-01-09 21:13:40 Far-sighted thinkers buy crypto, #HODL, short it before the crash & re-buy more in the fire sale. :)
2603 2018-01-09 21:13:36 Delta is what I use now after blockfolio would keep crashing when trying to add transactions.
2604 2018-01-09 21:13:32 I’ll relieve the stress on a beach somewhere when I’m done.

2610 2018-01-09 21:13:12 PIVX, NEBLIO, CLOAKCOIN, LITECOIN, VERGE... just to name a few. Severely undervalued coins.

2612 2018-01-09 21:13:07 Cryptonomy is another good option, looks promising except I wish we could choose to have candles on the charts instead of just a price line. I'm acquainted with the dev and know he cares a lot about making it a great app.

2617 2018-01-09 21:13:02 Yep. Swapped this week. Delta so far is 
2618 2018-01-09 21:13:02 Gonna make stocks as violent as crypto pulling that nonsense. Stock market traders going to lose their shirts.
2619 2018-01-09 21:12:52 or euro
2620 2018-01-09 21:12:52 No! $lend not even worth a penny!
2621 2018-01-09 21:12:50 このまま、年越しそば食べない事だけ祈ってる！
2622 2018-01-09 21:12:48 Not exactly rocket science but it's been really good for controlling emotions and eliminating over-analysis
2623 2018-01-09 21:12:43 Delta is way better and the option for multiple portfolio's for premium is great! They also are working on a dekstop app.
2624 2018-01-09 21:12:43 Well better knock those walls down quickly then cuz walls are blocking your money 
2625 2018-01-09 21:12:40 It's nothing specific to my device. It's just that you consider "one time" to mean once every time the condition occurs. That's what persistent alarms are for. Better ux would be one time only, even if price dips down and then re-fulfills condition of the alarm.
2626 2018-01-09 21:12:40 No recording of @Trader_Dante tonight, he forgot.
Fear not, the tl;dr is:
Tom won't become a Crypto Cword. Is long BTC unleveraged, small. Likes EURUSD into 50% & 1.19. Was watching USDCAD 1.2480. Is okay with puppies, dogs bit more meh. Likes Gold 1297.5 vs 1294.9. Cheers.
2627 2018-01-09 21:12:36 dont you do it, i had multi-BTC of that at 1sat back in the day. took me 6 months to exit at 1sat.
2628 2018-01-09 21:12:33 Deve ter parentes na familia italianos ou portugues. Pelo naris e sobrancelhas.... . Um pais tao miscigenado igual a este, não da para dizer se tem cara de brasileiro ou nao. hehehe
Congratulations Pal
2629 2018-01-09 21:12:32 HOLD $TRX
2630 2018-01-09 21:12:31 Delta doesnt always work the best either after a while it shows you are down in USD while your clearly up in both usd and btc
2631 2018-01-09 21:12:25 j'posais juste une question yes HS avec la crypto dsl haha. Je revends des pc et j'suis sous contrat avec un sponsor c'est pour ça
2632 2018-01-09 21:12:22 At least there aren't crypto-currency vendors every 300-metres in deprived areas as yet.
2633 2018-01-09 21:12:18 Hows TRX looking master?
2634 2018-01-09 21:12:13 fucking scammers ...
2635 2018-01-09 21:12:10 Same, switched to Delta today.. much better.  Wasn't fun re entering EVERYTHING tho
2636 2018-01-09 21:12:08 Yes bull run isn't over. One or 2 days of green, 1 day of red to btfd. You need btc to btfd
2637 2018-01-09 21:11:58 @BigCheds @davidgokhshtein  made a twitter handle a month ago because I understood the influence in crypto.

Today I am pleased to announce that I've officially gotten into my first twitter feud. 

This wouldn't have been possible without you boys. Thanks <3 ;]

Happy Trading!
2638 2018-01-09 21:11:57 Not cocky my friend, you may not realize the amount of time I spend responding to DM's. It's an all day job. And a lot of it is people trying to get free information / advice. It's no offense, but if you want to learn about crypto go to youtube.
2639 2018-01-09 21:11:55 This is just getting worse, I am trying my best to educate people about scammers. But the number of people joined crypto in the last two months is massive.
2640 2018-01-09 21:11:52 I just want more money to invest into #crypto 
2641 2018-01-09 21:11:47 Will $lend increase the same way?
2642 2018-01-09 21:11:42 Considering it's supply is 2.5 trillion if that happened it's market cap would be 3X the entirety of crypto currently 
2643 2018-01-09 21:11:40 il y a quoi comme crypto avec un bon potentiel sur kucoin ?
2644 2018-01-09 21:11:37 Quick somebody! Make Facecoin so they have to use 2facecoin, (which oddly is more accurate).
2645 2018-01-09 21:11:35 Oh #Crypto, who art in blockchains, hallowed be thy wallet, the kingdom come, thy will be done in fiat as it is on blockchains, give us our daily satoshis, and forgive us our weak hands as we forgive those who dumps on us, lead us not into fomo, and deliver us from FUD, Amen
2646 2018-01-09 21:11:32 @Nicholas_Merten while I understand your conflict of interest, no need to be down about it. Your educational videos in the #Crypto space have been very valuable for all of your followers and you have BY FAR done more good than harm! 
2647 2018-01-09 21:11:30 In this situation does lend give us some profit?
2648 2018-01-09 21:11:28 I got in on TRX when it was 1 cent and when it hit ATH 30 cents, i was tempted to cash out but decided to HODL for the bigger gains
2649 2018-01-09 21:11:27 Agreed. I like to sell 20-30% of my alt positions into btc after 3 or more consecutive green daily candles. Then I rebuy on any dips if I'm a believer in the coin's fundamentals
2650 2018-01-09 21:11:27 @CoinCap_io far more accurate 
2651 2018-01-09 21:11:23 $ENG will be top 20 coin by summer.  Great news today with $LEND partnership and @boxmining video on $ENG coming out tonight to his 140K subs! People just waking up to the data privacy protocol. Can see a ton of new partnerships here.
2652 2018-01-09 21:11:20 Just switched to Delta for those reasons, it's great.
2653 2018-01-09 21:11:20 or messes with crypto in some way

2657 2018-01-09 21:11:10 Cool pour achetée de la crypto !!
2658 2018-01-09 21:11:09 喝入れて下さい！って他人に頼むような人はそもそも向いてないし

このままじゃ手放しそうです！って、大暴落もしてないのにとんだ弱気ですね
400が300になったぐらいで手放すくらいの気持ちなら最初から買わなきゃ良かったのにと思います
2659 2018-01-09 21:11:03 Careful what you wish for, it's quite stressful at times xD
2660 2018-01-09 21:11:02 Totally agree don’t be greedy and wait for $$ people become millionaires not in one week.
2661 2018-01-09 21:10:43 Don't use delta!! It's working properly now, no need to shill it and make that one slow/buggy as well.
2662 2018-01-09 21:10:39 Check the exchange you have selected.
2663 2018-01-09 21:10:33 Hard to see it dropping below $0.8
2664 2018-01-09 21:10:32 Also, adding Wikitribune to the blogroll, and the crypto timeline tracker as a resource. Thank you for the work you're doing.
2665 2018-01-09 21:10:31 Got in a few days ago for $2.70. Going to HODL this baby
2666 2018-01-09 21:10:28 To get to the moon is a journey not a  straight line
2667 2018-01-09 21:10:21 Hope I get in on that ICO if they offer one!

2673 2018-01-09 21:10:04 They're fearing the truth because they're all in altcoins. The time will come when $Bitcoin will dominate the market again.
2674 2018-01-09 21:10:00 Nvo  features a plugin system that allows 3rd parties to create/add a token/coin to the dex. users than can choose whatever crypto plugin they want to add to  their profile
2675 2018-01-09 21:09:54 I just realized I have some omg on my old paper wallet #winning
2676 2018-01-09 21:09:53 Delta mate!
2677 2018-01-09 21:09:52 Someone please create Pets.comCoin so we can finally put a top in and end this #cryptobubble madness. #crypto #cryptocurrency #dotcombubbletwopointoh
2678 2018-01-09 21:09:52 This seems amazing. The advertising sector in the crypto world is still in its infancy. It will be amazing to see what this project achieves in the near future. Thank you!
2679 2018-01-09 21:09:48 "It's all about crypto, kid. The rest is conversation."
2680 2018-01-09 21:09:46 Shaved off my beard, sold some crypto #NewYearNewMe
2681 2018-01-09 21:09:46 I really like how KuCoin integrated Trading View charts into their platform. Smart move. They have sweet ass charts (most of us already use) AND they can spend dev time on critical platform items related to trades. Programming/building in-house charts is hard AF.
2682 2018-01-09 21:09:45 I've switch to Delta recently, have also many exchanges, in something blockfolio is better, but Delta is better for a lot of things. Faster updates of shitcoins freezed for hours on blockfolio, watchlist and more coins/exchanges
2683 2018-01-09 21:09:41 Nearly died !
Delta is much better.
2684 2018-01-09 21:09:37 Alt Euphoria is a good time to take profits and stockpile btc
2685 2018-01-09 21:09:36 BTW, I do not have any positions in either ETH (etherium) or BCH (bitcoin cash). It certainly looks like ETH is a buy, and BCH is a sell. #BCH #ETH #Crypto #cryptocurrency
2686 2018-01-09 21:09:35 Delta is nice; notifications are semi annoying, semi helpful - but can be stopped.
2687 2018-01-09 21:09:35 I dream to have that fear. Lol
2688 2018-01-09 21:09:29 entry if you missed original one would be off the 0.786 fib
there was plenty of profit taking at the 1 (50% gain)
2689 2018-01-09 21:09:24 #xrp Ethical question: if you had say $50000 in crypto and were told the only way to access and use it would be to have an implant would you take it or leave it? A question we all may need to consider at some point
2690 2018-01-09 21:09:23 let's make a deal :) I will read sth about IXCoin and u will read sth about #Unitus. deal?

2691 2018-01-09 21:09:21 What's the best #cryptocurrency forum to join? I'm looking for the equivalent of what NamePros is to the domaining industry, but for crypto.
2692 2018-01-09 21:09:21 thank you prof. when you leave 10 days i do my own study and research until now. i hope i learn more in this coming few weeks. thank you. thanks prof you're my inspiration,
2693 2018-01-09 21:09:21 @CryptoCompare is the best. Kan je rustig achter de computer je orders invullen, en ook gemakkelijk op je mobiele browser alles zien
2694 2018-01-09 21:09:14 got delta as well, too bad they haven't got orderbooks though... or am i missing something?
2695 2018-01-09 21:09:09 yea im startin to see that trend as well. Starting with APPC it looks like established companies will want full control of the tokens they use.
2696 2018-01-09 21:09:01 Woke up to seeing Strat at 105 :|
2697 2018-01-09 21:08:58 1BTCが18万円になったときすでに，円からの両替には心理的抵抗が。10万円〜12万円が当たり前だったので。今は45万円以上！
その点BitClubでは，前の投資がBTCを生み出してくれます！
ドル投資なので，円から投資する分には同じだし，もっているBTCからなら少なくて済みます！
2698 2018-01-09 21:08:58 yeah, cache problems I guess. pretty disturbing. delta is much better.
2699 2018-01-09 21:08:53 You’re very humble and give good advice. Anyone who’s negative towards you needs to take a good look in the mirror
2700 2018-01-09 21:08:48 Delta is definitely my favorite
2701 2018-01-09 21:08:46 Damn.  Really wish that I had a cryptopia account right about now.
2702 2018-01-09 21:08:43 Digibyte holding or we getting ready for a break out? #deepthoughts #dgb $dgb #digitbyte #altcoins #altcoin #cryptocurrency #crypto #cryptocurrencies #bittrex
2703 2018-01-09 21:08:40 My graphics, all messed up...how to explain to the wife? :)
2704 2018-01-09 21:08:36 Oh lordy I wish there were some sort of import/export tool so I didn't have to reenter everything on Delta
2705 2018-01-09 21:08:33 Hope so!
2706 2018-01-09 21:08:31 @crypto_rand what is your entry level for xrp? Is it close to a buy point or do you see more downside?
2707 2018-01-09 21:08:28 Will hit 2/3 billion soon 
2708 2018-01-09 21:08:23 Use Cryptoport!
2709 2018-01-09 21:08:21 Same. Blockfolio says $ICX is down 30% today. WTH! They’re working on it apparently.
2710 2018-01-09 21:08:20 I won’t be ignorant...it is the name of the video, but check how many exclamation marks was posted, other dude has a point...#facts
2711 2018-01-09 21:08:19 Same, gonna ask them for a refund for a new pair of pants
2712 2018-01-09 21:08:19 This will only battle harden current publicly available crypto.
2713 2018-01-09 21:08:14 Delta doesnt work either. For example; sophiatx is the same price all the time
2714 2018-01-09 21:08:13 Did you know? We are using the DPoS consensus algorithm to sign the blocks in the Scorum blockchain. Some of the upcoming promising forks are using the same algorithm ;)

2717 2018-01-09 21:07:59 Same shit. Charts wont load. Changes to big
2718 2018-01-09 21:07:58 CryptoPort for iOS has been on point lately. 5$, but API enabled. No Ku support.

2720 2018-01-09 21:07:54 The sheer amount of people who think altcoins cannot go down is pretty solid evidence of an imminent alts/BTC correction imo
2721 2018-01-09 21:07:53  Me too
2722 2018-01-09 21:07:53 I am sorry but TAs don't work in the crypto world.
2723 2018-01-09 21:07:52 If your in the US, what r u doing about this crazy law regarding paying taxes per crypto trade?
2724 2018-01-09 21:07:52 Friday's agenda:
1- Crypto talk
2- Updates on Boban Reddit
3- The argument for Davis Bertans in NBA HOF
4- Does Boban hold BTC?
5- Maybe a few NBA plays.
2725 2018-01-09 21:07:51 Delta is great, I've been using it for the past few months. Great team too @get_delta
2726 2018-01-09 21:07:50 Can't recommend delta enough, dumped blockfolio when they set the auto update to like 13 mins
2727 2018-01-09 21:07:49 Switched to Delta, easier life.
2728 2018-01-09 21:07:49 Oh boy $GRS feels good!
2729 2018-01-09 21:07:48 Both blockfolio and delta sucks today , keep unable to connect to server
2730 2018-01-09 21:07:47 I like CoinStats...
2731 2018-01-09 21:07:47 Same! I thought $ZRX had a 100% correction during lunch!
2732 2018-01-09 21:07:44 Yeah that's what triggered my tweet :)
2733 2018-01-09 21:07:42 Cmon man you know, the diversified long/short equity manager who has 57% of his fund in crypto.
2734 2018-01-09 21:07:40 crypto bridge legit?
2735 2018-01-09 21:07:40 Delta is better, but please let us know what’s your personal opinion :)
2736 2018-01-09 21:07:39 havent heard of Delta, but I think I might try it now too. Blockfolio is just getting ridic these days
2737 2018-01-09 21:07:38 Delta? Which one is that?
2738 2018-01-09 21:07:37 Seri pump yapınca SelAfee , yapmayınca coin bozuk 
2739 2018-01-09 21:07:30 Ok but tou might look back and say , ooooooh shiiiiieeeeeet.
2740 2018-01-09 21:07:18 the account @bitcoin is being used to shill a scam called #bcash using Bitcoin’s name. and that’s against the rules of twitter. a lot of new users in the crypto in twitter are in risk. this account have 2b  suspended permanently asap. #scam in @Twitter @TwitterSupport
2741 2018-01-09 21:07:17 You need to check out IXCoin.  It was the first Altcoin released in 2011 and it is also merge minded with bitcoin!
#IXC #bitcoin #secure #crypto #ixcoin #Traders
2742 2018-01-09 21:07:16 Oh that looks tasty - only been in crypto for a month but trying hard to understand the fundamentals, learn from the pros and be part of the community
2743 2018-01-09 21:07:10 お疲れ様です…
ひどい他力本願ですね
2744 2018-01-09 21:07:08 Very possible, yes.
2745 2018-01-09 21:07:07 Which is exactly what Facebook will end up doing soon! How will any technology compete?
2746 2018-01-09 21:07:06 Buggy @blockfolio .... Constantly showing different values for my biggest bags. I've almost had 3-5 heart attacks today.
Poor performance off late.... Let's try Delta
2747 2018-01-09 21:06:59 Crypto is the currency of Satan - confirmed.

2752 2018-01-09 21:06:25 What makes you say that?
2753 2018-01-09 21:06:21 so do you think these coins like Simple Token tryin to make it easier for companies to make their own will face an uphill battle?
2754 2018-01-09 21:06:21 $oax
2755 2018-01-09 21:06:18 i bought in with 20 coins plus :) 90% of my portfolio while in $eng
2756 2018-01-09 21:06:07 How is it plagiarized? Because someone random said it was or because you bought at the peak of the hype?
2757 2018-01-09 21:06:06 Most coins are designed to be digital currencies but have become commoditized by the ongoing crypto-craze... Where can one use DigiByte as a cryptocurrency, rather than as a commodity? IOW where can I use DGB to trade?
2758 2018-01-09 21:06:04 If u not invested in crypto we can’t be friends lol
2759 2018-01-09 21:06:03 Why FB should do that? Can't simply build its own crypto coin?
2760 2018-01-09 21:05:57 @Jaxx_Support information please can add crypto BWK on wallet jaxx app please. ?
2761 2018-01-09 21:05:53 Good morning #beijing I know you have it in you! #pumpXRP #cryptocurrency #crypto #XRP #ripple #altcoins #blockchain #xrprally
2762 2018-01-09 21:05:52 It’s ok nick, no rush. Take your time. Crypto just started.
2763 2018-01-09 21:05:49 Her own Crypto College fund.
2764 2018-01-09 21:05:49 Seriously. Ast is great! Can't wait for decentralized exchanges to eat the big dogs like coinbase. 

I'm looking forward to the day we can p2p trade. We shouldn't be too far off.
2765 2018-01-09 21:05:49 This literally didn't say anything... What will be improved? You also missed the large spike in price before announcement in your timeline.
2766 2018-01-09 21:05:43 Lmao. What else is better than waking up in the morning to crypto money ? Absolutely nothing. HODL for life.
2767 2018-01-09 21:05:43 I mean the crypto, not the altseason, hehe.
2768 2018-01-09 21:05:42 そうですね、余剰資金でやるのが一番かと！私は総資産の10%以内で、と決めて始めました。
与沢さんへのリプを見ていると

2769 2018-01-09 21:05:38 Bitcoin is higher than anything though
2770 2018-01-09 21:05:37 Sounds about right within the crypto game.
2771 2018-01-09 21:05:37 Zit je ook in Crypto?
2772 2018-01-09 21:05:36 x20 potentially! 
2773 2018-01-09 21:05:32 My bags are packed. But I could handle more. Let's get this show rolling!
2774 2018-01-09 21:05:30 Me: Hello Blockfolio, I would like to check my crypto portfolio

Blockfolio: "Servers Unavailable" but here is you portfolio from a day ago

Me 2 hours later:
2775 2018-01-09 21:05:30 Sipping Beaujolais and browsing anything crypto. I’m admittedly obsessed but for a reason. Great job global crypto communities, keep going! #crypto $LTC $ETH $BTC
2776 2018-01-09 21:05:22 Very impressive number of attendees, indeed. Looks like cryptocurrencies raise attention on real crypto #realworldcrypto
2777 2018-01-09 21:05:19 Do you guys follow @officialmcafee? He's not only an absolute legend but he's the man for crypto 
2778 2018-01-09 21:05:12 Which #cryptocurrency is a good buy this week?! #Crypto
2779 2018-01-09 21:05:08 Someone needs to create a crypto currency, the unicorn, and another, the rainbow. Then we can all have rainbows and unicorns.
2780 2018-01-09 21:05:05 As much as I really like many of these coins tech wise, It's much more profitable (and quite easy) for a big company to create its own coin rather than implementing one that's already here.
2781 2018-01-09 21:05:04 Regardez « BINANCE CRYPTO EXCHANGE » sur #BinanceVideo
2782 2018-01-09 21:05:03 I just purchased #buzzcoin because it supports distribution of renewable energy with smart contracts. I also purchased more #trx #tron on this dip. I am researching a few more as well.

If you like my choices, follow:

@CryptoMonkey001
#cryptocurrency #altcoins #bitcoin #crypto
2783 2018-01-09 21:04:58 Of course he’s going to downplay crypto, he’s with the banks!
2784 2018-01-09 21:04:56 @thebeetoken I love the concept of the company/coin as a real estate & crypto investor. I have concern about the bonuses (60-100%) for round 0 investors. What’s the deal with that? #ico $bee #alts
2785 2018-01-09 21:04:51 China will regulate crypto..bad news for #trx #tron $trx  very very bad
2786 2018-01-09 21:04:48 What does the sec know that others don’t ? Fed about to get medieval on crypto!
2787 2018-01-09 21:04:46 I thought #bch was supposed to be faster. Still waiting on my confirmations an hour later.
2788 2018-01-09 21:04:43 i hope we can say the same next year about this time on TRON #TRX
2789 2018-01-09 21:04:35 I'm pretty sure it will make me rich! Have been waiting for this!
2790 2018-01-09 21:04:33 Like you said freedom of speech I can say what I want so get back in your hole
2791 2018-01-09 21:04:33 But it's teamwork that made me money on crypto coins. 10 minds investing in the same market, sharing data is better than one.
2792 2018-01-09 21:04:33 Day 420 and $TRX and $XRP fanboys are no where to be found. At least #Ripple has a non plagiarized white paper and an actual product. #Tron is a complete shit show

2794 2018-01-09 21:04:23 This guys knows what's up
2795 2018-01-09 21:04:21 The purpose of finance is to fund risky ideas with payoffs that improve civilization. Credit is therefore a barometer of the ‘animal spirits’ of the market. Crypto is great for dealing with some transactional / settlement credit, which is a tiny % of credit
2796 2018-01-09 21:04:21 Another record high. It doesn't matter where you are from, how you grew up or how much money you make. Start investing your money now. Don't wait, get in on the stock market, get in on crypto, get a VIP package. Make your hard earned money multiply instead of sitting in a bank.
2797 2018-01-09 21:04:19 If the last 2 months taught us anything.. There is no logic in crypto
2798 2018-01-09 21:04:09 Time sharpen our approach to crypto? Or do you think this is just 2nd tier companies grasping at a lifeline ?
2799 2018-01-09 21:04:07 You should check out IXCoin.  You can merge mine IXCoin with bitcoin.  It is the first Altcoin created in 2011.  #ixc #Crypto #ixcoin #altcoin #fintec #mergemining #secure @ixcoinofficial @BittrexExchange
2800 2018-01-09 21:04:04 I dont talk or support any other crypto apart from #DeepOnion & #bitcoin #Crypto is becoming not just excepted but cool & #bitcoin is the king & for a long time It will have its natural ups & downs Yes it's more of store of value than a payment system now but i'd buy more
2801 2018-01-09 21:04:03 This thing: ? Or this thing:?

... or how about both???

#EthereumClassic #etc #altcoin #crypto $crypto
2802 2018-01-09 21:03:57 Other crypto companies are low key trying to slander Tron.  lol they know Tron is accomplishing alot over a short time and they barely have their platform built
2803 2018-01-09 21:03:55 In this moment I stop fallow stupid bitcoin twitter which is bcash roger ver troll channel...
2804 2018-01-09 21:03:53 Times like these are very... Very rare! We all should be grateful!
2805 2018-01-09 21:03:52 Half in stock market for dividends, lose the rest gambling poorly on crypto, keep working and not really changing spending habits, retire early in a decade or two
2806 2018-01-09 21:03:49 And they work together with real synergy, rather than trying to tear a community apart. Every normie that's asked me about, I've had to explain that Roger Ver is basic basically the boogie man of crypto ☇ #Bitcoin #lightningNetwork $Crypto

2889 2018-01-09 20:58:33 crypto is all about being smart and not being patient. i have been here for some years and only few coins are still there on top 10 list. there is 3rd blockchain generation meaning crypto is changing so fast. if you dont upgrade and wait too long you will look like this 
2890 2018-01-09 20:58:25 Yesterday I brought Zero (ZER) to your attention.

2932 2018-01-09 20:56:08 Not sure if you fully understand market caps or not but 0.5 usd doge would mean a 50 billion market cap, and 300 usd neo would mean about 24 billion market cap, infact you've got doge beating almost all of these in market cap?

2966 2018-01-09 20:54:21 How much have you made on crypto?
2967 2018-01-09 20:54:20 $etc to 100$ 
2968 2018-01-09 20:54:19 When I saw you post the website about crypto clothing you got my gears turning! If I make a fortune selling them I'll def. send you some bit for inspiring me!
2969 2018-01-09 20:54:16 Le meilleur conseil que je puisse te donner c’est de prendre le maximum de renseignement possible et si tu crois au projet garde les
2970 2018-01-09 20:54:16 English would be enough too but just note that you have a lot of supporters from Turkey 
2971 2018-01-09 20:54:14 Your contribution is in accurate and trying to pump a coin which is failing to rise so sit down and talk sense

2973 2018-01-09 20:54:12 Crypto bubble'ı menkul kıymetler borsasına sıçrayacak sanırım önümüzdeki günlerde. Büyük şirketler kendi koinlerini çıkardıkça borsadaki hisse senetleri coşacak, borsalar bu bir iki yıl Dot-Com Bubble 2'yi yaşadıktan sonra da malum sona yaklaşılır artık. At fav'a bekle...
2974 2018-01-09 20:54:12 Does anyone know of good telegram groups for $crypto?
2975 2018-01-09 20:54:11 why speak to her?

 - she has done nothing but call bitcoin a scam for 5 years!

she uses long words from ancient history to try + appear clever 

- doesnt get economics - doesnt get finance - doesnt get crypto

repugnant @FT shill

2980 2018-01-09 20:54:05 Good part: Maybe 10% of them are heavy hitters.
2981 2018-01-09 20:54:02 good advice!
2982 2018-01-09 20:54:00 One of the brilliant minds the world saw, Aaron Swartz, explains de-centralisation of networks (2007). In hindsight these thoughts are seemingly being implemented in Decentralised Crypto networks. Wish the world gets more time with people like Aaron.
2983 2018-01-09 20:53:59 A blind monkey can configure TLS in a secure manner: The default configuration for most web servers is at least reasonably secure (though they may include crap crypto for compatibility).
2984 2018-01-09 20:53:59 さすがです！
2985 2018-01-09 20:53:58 Starting soon on selling crypto leans with a GUARANTEED RETURN if you don't finish up over 50% on the month... who's interested?

2988 2018-01-09 20:53:53 My technical understanding of cryptocurrencies is close to minimal regarding basics but I believe that backing a virtual highly speculative crypto currency with a sovereign country 's #oil reserves is dangerous and extremely uncertain.. #petro #oil #oott #venezuela

2990 2018-01-09 20:53:51 MOST ANNOYING PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET: Buyers of Crypto or Weed Stocks. We get it, you're cool, but keep it to yourself.
2991 2018-01-09 20:53:50 あ、昨日それ見かけました！
さすがに暴言の内容が…
わたしフォロワーさん少ないですけどRTしておきますね！
これは個人的な意見なので賛同されないかもしれませんが私は、あまりにギリギリで生きてる人は仮想通貨で大きく遊ぶべきではないと思っています。余裕がないとイライラしますからね
(･_･;)
2992 2018-01-09 20:53:48 Yes. Get out now! I assure you I am not interested in lowering the price so I can buy it cheaper. Trust me. This is the internet. Nobody lies on the internet.
2993 2018-01-09 20:53:44 thanks for the recommend! ye I signed up for gemini today, Coinbase were charging me 7%, they got my last trade today and I moved all money out
2994 2018-01-09 20:53:43 Crypto getting mature :)
2995 2018-01-09 20:53:37 I have an algorithmic trading bot that is trading 3 crypto and 4 fiat pairs, total about $3M / month.
2996 2018-01-09 20:53:36 I dont know man, for some reason I never had a problem, maybe I am just lucky, but I think the DEX is just bullish af.
2997 2018-01-09 20:53:35 One of the truly great shitbags in crypto. Competition will come in this year and the garbage you call an exchange will be a trivia question in 5 years. “Name the shitexchange that got shut down and forced government regulation on crypto”
2998 2018-01-09 20:53:34 Definitely not

FA works extremely well on long time frames, just be prepared to hodl for years if need be.

TA works extremely well on short time frames, don't be afraid to take quick profits while day trading
3002 2018-01-09 20:53:24 FUEL?
3003 2018-01-09 20:53:21 Well, let me know what I meant. Marketing ploy and a cover for the time you've made me waste. Do you know about crypto?  #compliance
3004 2018-01-09 20:53:19 Because we don’t recommend shitcoin and stick to key infrastructure
3005 2018-01-09 20:53:14 Holding! Lets go!

3007 2018-01-09 20:53:02 Hey @MercatoxCom can you give @BlockfolioApp some support for your exchange???
3008 2018-01-09 20:53:02 It’ll be primarily based on price data that’s supplemented with social media mentions and relevant articles. Check out the landing page for a detailed description. We’re building this for all crypto investors.
3009 2018-01-09 20:52:58 We already in because of @jessecouch , he is a hidden jem of crypto community..
3010 2018-01-09 20:52:52 How would you advise a holder?

I would lose as a trader, but I am DCA’ing and buying a diversified portfolio of projects I like. I really dont concern myself with the current price, I will just revisit in 5 years. Does this sound like the best hodl strategy?

3013 2018-01-09 20:52:36 ICOs, ICOs everywhere. Coming next: ICOs to be able to buy ICOs. Ops. Ethereum could already be considered that. Don't hate me, I actually like ETH. XD
3014 2018-01-09 20:52:25 I won't even blink at it until it gets close to its ATH. Sold off mine for profit and haven't looked back.
3015 2018-01-09 20:52:20 Scam coin
3016 2018-01-09 20:52:17 You know what one of the problems with crypto currency is that I didn't take into consideration much, until I saw an article yesterday, is the amount of power it consumes to mine them.

3023 2018-01-09 20:52:04 Very lucky. Because up to that point I only knew Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple existed. South-Africa is a sad place for crypto 
3024 2018-01-09 20:52:01 You know there are like 20 other reputable exchanges correct?
3025 2018-01-09 20:51:54 Nah not until he gives me the courtside seats I deserve.

3071 2018-01-09 20:49:35 If you're new to Crypto, do your diligence and research your investments. Research the people you follow on Twitter and do you homework. It's easy to find a tweet that you want to see but more important to do your homework. Crypto 2018 will be a wild ride. #XRP #ENG #BTC #ETH

3073 2018-01-09 20:49:28 Large international businesses need means to move money internally and externally quickly and legally.  In my opinion, large businesses owning XRP or using dedicated rails based off of $XRP will come first for large banks.

3083 2018-01-09 20:49:04 @elonmusk Are you investing in crypto at all? Curious. Hope you’re having a great day.

3085 2018-01-09 20:49:01 Unlink your phone number from sensitive accounts no matter what. Use a hardware wallet instead of an app for storing/sending crypto if we're not talking like $100k.

分散投資の神ですね
3126 2018-01-09 20:46:38 Felicitări!
3127 2018-01-09 20:46:35 The main point of crypto currencies is to avoid regulation and regulators, so why is the market reacting badly to China and South Korean disapproval? Whoever bans it or disapproves can surely be avoided by the cryptos being anonymous! That is why criminals use it. Am I wrong?
3128 2018-01-09 20:46:29 Phew!! Ok thanks
3129 2018-01-09 20:46:28 Guess what happens if all students drop out of university to focus on crypto trading. The farmers want to make their money with cryptos instead farming. We get from on overbanked world to an over-crypto world.

3131 2018-01-09 20:46:24 Perfect time to buy in the crypto world
3132 2018-01-09 20:46:21 I originally came here for fast money but as I $dyor I understood crypto is freedom. So... No number. I'll just cash out a little to live from it, but I would never stop.

3135 2018-01-09 20:46:07 Why we need crypto if we have $ ? 
3136 2018-01-09 20:46:04 Ripple isn't a currency to buy things with. It's a transfer & settlement system for financial institutions. Its target is SWIFT's business, not being used to buy bread, milk, or weed.
3137 2018-01-09 20:46:03 I'm sure people panicked a little when they saw 115 BTC worth of TRX get filled in about 2 minutes, but price was being pushed down so the whale could get that order filled.  Could see 10%-20% jump now.  HODL

3139 2018-01-09 20:45:57 that every crypto ico is not worth the risk, that you need to exaggerate and tweak few strategies to get things done in market, that forcasting isn't accurate always and how to register VAT with uae authorities and last but not least ad spend and ad sense for ecommerce

3168 2018-01-09 20:43:58 I'm in the process of coming up with an algorithm/recipe more or less of how I trade in crypto, cause I'm not sure the exact recipe myself just yet lol. Has many parallels to the way I treat fantasy football though lmao (now you're taking me serious) just a lot more touch and go
3169 2018-01-09 20:43:54 $XVG is a true shitcoin and I'm not actually trading this.
3170 2018-01-09 20:43:53 If all the FUD about $XRP #ripple is getting you down, just think about it this way: XRP may not be the next big decentralized crypto, but it's on the way to becoming the next big way to move centralized currency. Doesn't that sound like something you want to own a part of?

3267 2018-01-09 20:36:22 I think I’m pretty sad that I passed on the ICO for under half a penny per coin. But really, it’s a solid project and emerging as a leader. Definitely one to watch for me.

3272 2018-01-09 20:35:46 I'm in a cafe overhearing a guy coaxing his pal into buying 2 or 3 grand of crypto currency as though it was putting a team on a coupon. We live in dark times.
3273 2018-01-09 20:35:43 This is not accurate. crypto fresh is not feeding properly
3274 2018-01-09 20:35:43 His exact wording is, “Here is my ANALYSIS”.  How is this not claiming?
3275 2018-01-09 20:35:40 Fucking crazy, the top 45 market caps in crypto are > 1 bill
3276 2018-01-09 20:35:39 And don’t forget - with cryptos you don’t own anything. No share of a company. And if you need a crypto for a payment transfer - why paying thousands of dollars for such a coin when you can transfer money for less than a few cents?

3297 2018-01-09 20:34:38 wash trading bitcion futures = illegal
wash trading bitcoin = questionable legality
If you're sure that it's illegal, why don't you report them to the authorities? Who would you report to? Who has regulatory jurisdiction over Bitfinex?
3298 2018-01-09 20:34:36 No way! I’m saying I’ve been invested in $XRP since it was .20 and tweeted about the investment at that time.
3299 2018-01-09 20:34:34 Fair point , taken onboard. 

As for the charting , i think becsuse it is volatile charting goes a long way to helping you manage gains and loses in the crypto world, its wont be perfect but it helps to understand some basic charting concepts, just my opinion.

3316 2018-01-09 20:33:20 4. Agrees wash trading occurs and notes that laws that apply to traditional markets do not necessarily apply to crypto at this time. 

The question of ‘should they?’ is another discussion entirely. I assume ur advocating they should. Are you taking steps to see that happen?
3317 2018-01-09 20:33:14 What tools do you use for tech analysis and what are good resources to get up to speed quickly on key crypto indicators?

3327 2018-01-09 20:32:38 Just a measly 2000+% on my MCO Ico, and a few other similar ones, but don't let that fool you, and don't get caught up in the elusive 100x.  Remember, 5 * 5 * 4 also equals 100 x.  Einstein was wrong, compounding crypto gains is the 8th Wonder of the world.

3335 2018-01-09 20:31:45 For example, $dent and $qlc have a bigger total supply bc they save a portion to be able to buy thru the app. But what everyone on twitter talks about is the circulating supply that goes up and down in value

3355 2018-01-09 20:30:51 Price of coin times circulating supply, that calculates the “value” of the total coins. But also consider researching why there might be a difference between circ and total supply. For ex, they might have coins out in the exchanges and reserve an amount for other purpose

3385 2018-01-09 20:28:42 “Not illegal in crypto, even though it is in everything else.” Right, because it is fraud… which is an argument for why crypto needs regulation, and not a justification for wash trading in crypto.

3418 2018-01-09 20:26:31 Nainan is basically a silicon valley douche, so that isn't terribly surprising he is into crypto.
3419 2018-01-09 20:26:25 One of the best! Once people sign up & start using it they will get the hang of it in no time. #DEX is the future to #crypto trading.
3420 2018-01-09 20:26:20 I don’t need a stock broker just a crypto coin goat and i’ll spend 2X that
3421 2018-01-09 20:25:58 That's the good thing about crypto at the moment. A million opportunities.
3422 2018-01-09 20:25:53 Can $intc say that they are investing in crypto ? #needtoflipatrade
3423 2018-01-09 20:25:50 Everyone on TWTR is a crypto millionaire hehe
3424 2018-01-09 20:25:40 Wish i had the money to buy more only have 1,432 shares just going to hold with what i have and hope for the best
3425 2018-01-09 20:25:38 Crypto is like a store’s loyalty program on steroids. It fuels competition, innovation, investment, and company culture optimization.
3426 2018-01-09 20:25:29 Just what the tyrants were looking for to chitter chatter about at their meetings on how to shut down crypto. Oh well let the war for freedom continue.

3430 2018-01-09 20:25:05 yup :(
3431 2018-01-09 20:25:04 Crypto Twitter very defensive lol
3432 2018-01-09 20:25:03 all crypto will go up, just depends whatcha want from it ie quiick returns or long term
3433 2018-01-09 20:25:00 Nothing but love in the crypto space. Rach and Rachel is COMPLETELY different anyways.
3434 2018-01-09 20:24:52 I disagree, and furthermore you are a bad person.
3435 2018-01-09 20:24:42 Thanks, but it was just a joke. My Tax Adviser is still working with me. and due to me, he is in crypto for some months now as well. :D it's just that everything can be quite confusing when you are first confronted with it :) Cheers!

3443 2018-01-09 20:24:17 If everybody hodls this bubble will never bust :-) unfortunately you also will never be able to buy something :-) but that’s the issue with virtual wealth - I guess the clever guy already left this market some while ago :-)
3444 2018-01-09 20:24:10 For me #Monero will be the best anonymous coin at the moment. It is well established, development, has a large community and strong investors. I will place #Zcash as a secondary but then again #Spectrecoin has huge potential and features going for it...

3446 2018-01-09 20:24:09 $BTC bitcoin has been in a strange wave lately. I'm still holding though. Expected Jan 15th Wall Street bonuses to rally the crypto markets.

3450 2018-01-09 20:23:59 Pretty much what it says on the tin Dr. Trumpsta - if a risk management desk at a spread betting/ CFD firm aren’t netting a position off, they will either borrow shares or in this case, the crypto. This allows them to equally net the position off when there aren’t enough buyers.
3451 2018-01-09 20:23:58 Cute you think I'll care. From 250usd to 2k is only x8. Literally every shitcoin does that nowadays. I hope you're right though. Got nothing against your coin.

3459 2018-01-09 20:23:18 Not a lot of chatter about $TNB .  I think that's a good sign.  Calm before the storm.  :)  I expect a 2-3x within a few weeks.
3460 2018-01-09 20:23:11 oh no! i hope everything is okay

3480 2018-01-09 20:21:04 Yeah, thanks for the reminder.  It was more of a joke because every stupid coin today has a market cap of >1b, so its refreshing to see something interesting not hyped yet. It has zk snarks with PoS? Which PoS protocol?

3496 2018-01-09 20:20:06 Sadly, it may take a bunch of people getting thoroughly wrecked for the market to finally understand that, unlike stocks, crypto is largely a zero sum game. Once that happens alts will collapse and only Bitcoin and a few alts that serve some useful niche, will survive & thrive

3511 2018-01-09 20:18:39 CEO of @jpmorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon spoke about the viability of decentralized cryptocurrency, predicting that all digital currencies will eventually be fiat, or government-controlled. Will this defeat the purpose?

3545 2018-01-09 20:16:12 It’s straight from their Whitepaper - link to the website is in the tweet if you want to check it out. It has a few other images similar to this one as well

3566 2018-01-09 20:14:46 I know it's not cool to block people but would you consider blocking some of these pump groups that keep popping up on your feed? Crypto noobs are really going to be hurt by these guys.

3583 2018-01-09 20:13:37 I'm a bit of a contrarian. It's legit competition, Mike. The space is a tech echo chamber. Most in crypto don't know that developers and tech don't always win. Usability matters, cost matters, and users matter.
3584 2018-01-09 20:13:35 I feel like I’ve missed out so much as I have just begun my crypto journey... but on the other hand we’re just getting started!

3587 2018-01-09 20:13:12 It’s getting out of control.

Welcome to the League of Legends champion spotlight featuring Crypto - The Blockchain
3588 2018-01-09 20:13:10 Obviously true. Cryptocurrencies' only value is the fear of missing out (of course only until the next great crypto comes along). It's funny that the same folks who are concerned about the environment are completely OK with this tremendous waste of energy and resources.

3595 2018-01-09 20:12:37 @itvMLshow what crypto should I invest in?
3596 2018-01-09 20:12:36 Also try market selling dust into BTC, there might be no minimum amount? But seems like I would've already tried that.. lol
3597 2018-01-09 20:12:36 I find crypto technology interesting to improve our existing financial system. But this anarchistic idea everything decentralised is good everything centralised is bad is just black and white

3613 2018-01-09 20:11:25 I really liked your tweets up until now and genuinely thought you were on to something, but comparing futures and agencies that govern them to crypto is straight up idiotic. Wash trading in crypto is NOT illegal whereas in pretty much anything else it is. This is a fucking fact.

3622 2018-01-09 20:10:55 Great to hear, thank you.
3623 2018-01-09 20:10:48 It's Crypto mania! Nothing means anything right now. There's a token worth $10 bil with a white paper and movie name recognition only. There's a coin to pay future dentists worth 2 Billion. Fundamentals are forgotten right now. Ride the wave. Plan your exit.
3624 2018-01-09 20:10:39 So buy now? 
3625 2018-01-09 20:10:31 Too Cheap. Need .03 min. Those are top-notch calls tho so stop giving it away. 

I like your enthusiasm. Maybe the "Hungry Crypto Hippo Herd".

3644 2018-01-09 20:09:08 Or I give you control of my stocks, you can split them between crypto and day trading and I will cut you 5-25% of the profit you make trading them daily, based on the % of profit compared to initial investment. (example: I make 0-30% profit, nets you 5%, 100%+ you get 25%)
3645 2018-01-09 20:09:08 Congrats! I'm sure there will be even more soon. What time zone 5pm?
3646 2018-01-09 20:09:07 Hey ledge. Not home right now so I could be wrong. But I believe you can sell dust, no minimum, into their bnb token. This might only be true as a market sell. Worth playing around with.
3647 2018-01-09 20:09:03 Thank you
3648 2018-01-09 20:09:02 Hi Todd, ICO tokens are disrupting venture capital and may have the potential to disrupt equities in the future with the ability to fractionalize all kinds of assets; if a cannabis company that you liked had an ICO, maybe you would jump into "crypto" then?
3649 2018-01-09 20:09:01 Maybe I can invent a joke crypto-currency and then laugh as the world gives me real money in exchange for it.
3650 2018-01-09 20:09:00 Ok @coinbase @CoinbaseSupport it’s been a full 7 days since I made me ACH deposit. Is there a big back up or something because it’s still not in my account. Don’t wanna miss all these nice sales

3673 2018-01-09 20:07:11 Investing in crypto is all about entering a coin at the right time when it's still low before it makes a big bounce, like Ripple has, and has since come down in a correction. Just be willing to lose what you put in if you aren't sure what you're doing. Hope this helps

3679 2018-01-09 20:06:36 Again - I don't know much about crypto or this ecosystem yet. But when it comes to technology, whitepapers, and the politics that go on behind the scenes to propel companies to success - I actually do know a little about that. And trust me -TRX looks good there. THAT'S why I'm in

3718 2018-01-09 20:03:28 LIFEtoken_: RT Jakeoptomus1: 03_senthil LIFEtoken_ Follow their telegram. The CEO said himself last night on there he will personally make sure no one loses anything on coin exchange. Telegram has a great LIFE comunity and answers many questions.

3721 2018-01-09 20:03:19 ありがとうございます！
感謝です！

このようなモロにおかしいコインにはひっかからないつもりですが
いい草あるよ…という話には耳を傾けてしまいそうな自分がいるので、
良さそうだと思ったものにすぐに飛び付くのではなく
どんなコインなのか？と逐一自分で勉強しなきゃなと日々言い聞かせてます
3722 2018-01-09 20:03:16 well wouldn't that be incredible.

3727 2018-01-09 20:03:03 Why not publishing an article about the apps infrastructure. I'm sure that many crypto devops would help with scaling.
3728 2018-01-09 20:02:55 Building our office is in is offering a "crypto & blockchain," luncheon learning session. This from the same people that hosted a Thanksgiving turkey coloring contest and play cartoons and have cereal on Wednesday mornings in the atrium.
3729 2018-01-09 20:02:54 I like @binance_2017, but they are creating landfills of crypto dust with the way they manage trading whole numbers, as well as referrals. Hope they figure that out.
3730 2018-01-09 20:02:52 Ah, your anti crypto altogether? A little hypocritical from what your saying, no?

Rule 1; put long term investments on a ledger.

Rule 2. Have some short term trading money.

Rule 3. Don't panic sell or fomo.

Rule 4. By the dips

Need to fix my sleeping pattern but who cares. We're in the gold rush of our lives.
3736 2018-01-09 20:02:09 thank u :)
3737 2018-01-09 20:02:04 what exactly is your issue? 
The article speaks specifically to Bitcoin's market share in relation to other crypto currencies.

3742 2018-01-09 20:01:18 And since you brought up "time horizons", great plan to break BTC before trying to create wishful solutions.
3743 2018-01-09 20:01:18 thanks for that.  Yeah I never understood so never got involved.  Oh well, I'm in other crypto. Congrats on that trade.
3744 2018-01-09 20:01:17 We’re missing it ever since you bailed from Agora.  At you involved with a crypto/blockchain newsletter available@elsewhere now?

3746 2018-01-09 20:01:12 I can’t stop crypto’ing
3747 2018-01-09 20:01:11 Maybe when I make my first mil in crypto than I’ll move to another market but for now, it doesn’t make sense when u can make 2000 3000 % profits in a week lol

3759 2018-01-09 20:00:49 Y $NGC es un coin (salido de ICO hace poco también) sobre esport que, sobre lo que llevo estudiado, parece un buen proyecto, aunque sigo buscando info. Creo que crypto+esport es un mix que como se de con la tecla puedes ser

3762 2018-01-09 20:00:29 Crypto prices dropped yesterday because Coinmarketcap started excluding Korean exchanges from average price calculation.  Korean exchanges routinely trade at 30% higher prices so this caused a big ‘dip’ on coinmarketcap even though actual prices didnt change.

3766 2018-01-09 20:00:20 @patientory, you have coins like $medibloc currently performing very well in terms of marketcap and taking a large market share in crypto/healthcare. What differences are there between the two organisations and how do you see yourselves competing against them in this space?

3771 2018-01-09 20:00:13 I guess PBOC and CPG agree with you, it's always been known China is the leader in identifying devilish over valued systems that provide no value. They restricted use because they have the best interest of their citizens at heart. Pretty sure that interpol list was the catalyst.
3772 2018-01-09 20:00:13 Righteous Joe. PPT
3773 2018-01-09 20:00:12 You should try data and argument.  It's beats ad hominem every time.
3774 2018-01-09 20:00:12 You’re fully right, I’m sure there’ll be some plateau before breaking. Although with the amount of ICO’s under their platform this month, I believe the Neo ecosystem will have so much money funneled through it that it’s inevitable to reach a new satoshi ATH in the 1-2 months.

3783 2018-01-09 19:59:53 Proficiat! Blijf je wel actief binnen het crypto wereldje? Als ondernemer dan bedoel ik?
3784 2018-01-09 19:59:45 I'm just newbie, but yes, this tales about crypto currencies are true. Willn't last forever, so this is a good moment to invest for short time almost an small % of money you don't really need.
3785 2018-01-09 19:59:41 @coin_based513 welcome to crypto. It can be a bumpy ride. HODL!
3786 2018-01-09 19:59:32 Crypto reminds me of the ".com bubble" everyone bought into every single .com stock. Then it crashed.
3787 2018-01-09 19:59:32 This is why I'm getting out of the stock market all together $fvrd no way this should be down .. I'll stick to my 1000% gains in crypto currency

3791 2018-01-09 19:59:10 Bro make a list of just crypto accounts. You can tap in that way
3792 2018-01-09 19:59:07 Not a fan of crypto ETFs or anything that makes it easier to get pension/retirement funds exposed to this craziness. Futures are ok, but not ETFs. The tech is still too early on the maturity curve for that, need to keep crypto risk quarantined for a few more years.
3793 2018-01-09 19:58:51 i guess it's because these large corporations are starting to realise the blockchain isn't going away any time soon, And of course all they have to do is mention crypto and their stock soars. I think we're going to witness a whole spate of them now.
3794 2018-01-09 19:58:51 THE $ZRX AIRDROP TWEET IS FROM A FAKE ACCOUNT DO NOT INPUT YOUR INFO
3795 2018-01-09 19:58:49 BTCrs tend to only care about price and not the underlying sustainability of the tech.  Nice.  That price will turn as BTC has lost its utility.
3796 2018-01-09 19:58:47 I'm starting to think that the crypto bubble is proof that the illuminati exists and it's all a big scam to destabilise the world and a new global despotic order arises.
3797 2018-01-09 19:58:45 Ridiculous. You earned your money. You've always try to help others up along the way whether it's your mma picks or crypto stuff. If I made it, I hope to be as friendly as you've been.
3798 2018-01-09 19:58:34 If the crypto is not affected as expected, then more people will jump to crypto. Coinbase will stop accepting new users.

3806 2018-01-09 19:58:04 Nah, I have crypto on coinomi, binance, jaxx (don't ask) so just use it to keep track of total in one place!
3807 2018-01-09 19:58:01 @BlockfolioApp a few off my coins keep showing historic prices (i think linked to binance) instantly wiping off value from my portfolio, crapped myself when i first saw it
3808 2018-01-09 19:57:51 He was be referring to centralized crypto like Ripple, clearly wouldn't say this about Bitcoin.

3817 2018-01-09 19:57:10 Watching a bit about "Hypebeast" - super exclusive clothing releases that people buy and resell.

And people say crypto is a meaningless bubble.

Try a white Louis Vuitton T-shirt for $1500 resale.
3818 2018-01-09 19:57:08 If blockchain technology is so great, why do the crypto-currency exchanges even exist?  These exchanges don't use blockchain tech to process your transactions, lend you money, or help you go short, because it just isn't practical to do so.  Maybe in the future, but not yet.

3836 2018-01-09 19:55:48 Dude, this conversation is over because you don't see time horizons at all and you have no capacity to defend yourself from indulging in ignorance. You're reveling in talking points that are 2 years old in a 9 year market. Shortsightedness will be your undoing.
3837 2018-01-09 19:55:38 Ah  j’en est achetée pas mal y’a quelques mois ( bonne investissement pour le moment) je sais pas si je dois vendre ou non ..
3838 2018-01-09 19:55:36 Bitcoin made up 86% of the crypto market one year ago. Today, it only has 36% of the market.
3839 2018-01-09 19:55:36 Donc vous approuvez que les dirigeants crypto-laïcards en France soient des alliés de régimes fascistes, islamistes et moyenâgeux qatari et saoudien, pourvoyeurs avérés de ce même terrorisme qui a frappé #charliehebdo?

3846 2018-01-09 19:55:11 I just went down the road for chips and saw that crap car in the front garden at 132. Right dodgy fuckers, not giving them my 50p!

3850 2018-01-09 19:54:34 $FB has expressed interest in cryptos also. I actually see a real possibility there. If FB adopted crypto for payments it would be MASSIVE for the entire crypto market ... and would add a lot of legitimacy to it. If Zuck decides there is no use for crypto for him it will crush it

3858 2018-01-09 19:54:09 You sayin XRP will drop to .20c?
3859 2018-01-09 19:54:03 I'm a newbie at crypto so i followed folks say at the chat room and bought $yes, $yay, $adam, $linda,$carbon,$pac,$nyc,$funk,$dime and $mcrn but most of them just didn't rise but keep dumping and I'm really frustrating now I just can't reach that ‘hodl’ situation yet
3860 2018-01-09 19:54:02 But Wells Fargo, Freddie Mac, AIG, GM, Bank of America, JP Morgan / Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Capital One... they are the good guys right? The list goes on. Do you actively discourage business with them?
3861 2018-01-09 19:54:01 The crypto scene right now, is dominated by greed not idea of revolution and decentralization, recent price jump of ripple confirms that... This ICO will definitely scoop up all those money it's aiming at, the end of Satoshi's vision, God help us 
3862 2018-01-09 19:53:57 Put a price chart there instead. Lol. Bcash is still below its launch price of $3k. Bcash is centralized around Roger. Imagine if he fudded bcash like bitcoin. It'd be over fast.
3863 2018-01-09 19:53:55 Crypto is funny money you have to admit.
3864 2018-01-09 19:53:52 when is new user registration expected to open?

3880 2018-01-09 19:52:59 @TeamJRBusiness New into crypto. Your vids inspired me. I bought nano s and it should be here 2day. Found out it only holds 4 cryptos.  Do you have suggestion for hardware wallet that holds more?  Thx

3890 2018-01-09 19:52:20 Nice argument so as i think the name is already soiled i will create my Version of it and call it the real one.... but will take the Blockchain,tech,users,name and Hash power to prove that My Bitcoin version is better??
3891 2018-01-09 19:52:06 It is lovely there though. Been to estepona and the towns around it! The canary islands infind more beautiful, better weather year around!
3892 2018-01-09 19:52:03 I need a couple of game codes to give away on my @WatchMixer stream, any #gamedev out there willing to accept crypto in exchange for a code or two? I have ETH I can trade.
3893 2018-01-09 19:52:02 Oh crypto Twitter. You can shill prices for a coin. But ever checked market cap? How on earth can a coin can go to a 500 billion market cap all of a sudden. Especially when it has 0 fundamentals.

3897 2018-01-09 19:51:52 Eh if I'm going to invest in something other than crypto I want to produce money not just speculation from fear. Crypto is good for that
3898 2018-01-09 19:51:48 People are getting too caught up in short term crypto gains. Invest based on what will survive 3-5 years from now. 90% of projects in this market will eventually fail. #cryptocurrencies #GVT #QASH
3899 2018-01-09 19:51:46 I was 0.7 $BTC few months ago. Crypto twitter got me to 3 BTC today. On this trajectory, you will require airspace approval to ever get near my moon.
3900 2018-01-09 19:51:44 OMG! You got a better buy in than me on #trx! Nice going
3901 2018-01-09 19:51:33 I REFUSE TO BELIEVE. ETC the slowest paper trade of 2017-2018...
3902 2018-01-09 19:51:27 How do I know if John mcAfee hasn't been hacked?? Is this sponsored or does he hold some. Any case this will not be genuine. We need someone with zero conflict of interest. Crypto profit is too tempting for that so I guess we can all keep FOMO in..

3908 2018-01-09 19:50:54 Much lower marketcap than BNB right now too. I'm buying on any dips. Considering the market, I see this easily 5-10x from here within the next month. All the big coins haven't even started trading yet. When they do, traffic will increase alot and so will $COB.
3909 2018-01-09 19:50:52 @davidgokhshtein nee to crypto and trading in general. Where can I find these ratings so I know what they mean? Searched the web and found nothing.
3910 2018-01-09 19:50:37 July is 6 months away. Hopefully my crypto assets hit $1 mil in which case I'll fly there to  watch and I'll yell "I'm a millionaire" at 4 minutes and 20 seconds into the debate. If you don't hear this then I am still a mere financial mortal and I still can't afford to come.

3923 2018-01-09 19:50:11 Ce sont deux technologies différentes Absol, il y a vraiment peu de chance que ça arrive. Le BTC va demeurer leader pendant très longtemps sur le marché crypto et il va rester une valeur d’échange, (un peu comme l’or). Par contre yes, l’éther il va surement faire x5 en 2018
3924 2018-01-09 19:50:08 Ripple’s $XRP is averaging in the billions of dollars in daily volume. When will it be added?

3935 2018-01-09 19:48:56 I would transfer those Dragons to a hardware wallet. Then use that address for the KYC.
3936 2018-01-09 19:48:54 Shill it bud 
3937 2018-01-09 19:48:50 Yeah, the one who creates an app that can convert any crypto to any other crypto or currency for instant payment will rule the world. And, put currency traders out of business.

KRACK is an implementation vulnerability that breaks the crypto in WPA2

3964 2018-01-09 19:46:41 Because it is more than just a pick. Tons of analysis and then a community of insiders to discuss crypto with which is very valuable.  Once again, you know not what you speak of.
3965 2018-01-09 19:46:36 JFC. And did I see a story about a crypto for gamers too?
3966 2018-01-09 19:46:32 Bad news crypto market went down good news it's recovering an we in the grn

3968 2018-01-09 19:46:17 F-Type..A crypto mastermind should be more concerned of the performance over cost savings.. (i.e gas millage)
3969 2018-01-09 19:46:16 I don't wash trade, too much effort for murky waters. There is no law or statute that makes it illegal for crypto. Like I stated above, laws only work if there is an actual worded law/statute that classifies crypto as a regulated asset that makes wash trading illegal.

3973 2018-01-09 19:46:04 That statement makes the assumption that the devil we know is better. At one point in history freedom was the unknown devil, and people chose tyranny out of fear of the unknown. Sometimes innovation requires changing of the guard.

The early investor of Coinbase and now a board member was an initial investor in tron. A future addition...
3989 2018-01-09 19:44:39 Its gonna do that thing where it looks like everyone will get rich then it sticks its finger in your butt and makes you quack like a duck. And THEN those who can #HODL through the bum tickling will get rich :)

3991 2018-01-09 19:44:33 So I would really like to see a nice $BTC climb this week. As much as I like a few alt coins, let's be real BTC is the future standard of crypto currency.

3994 2018-01-09 19:44:19 I have done some reading on crypto today and have some critism for #TRX. I really don't like the outgoing communication. 

Video, flyer, twitter and dev. updates don't look like a structured business. People like and trust structured businesses.

4004 2018-01-09 19:43:30 @realDonaldTrump when credit cards where out, people never really cared for them, until they could magically draw money out, crypto currency had started like 20 years ago, i at first thought it was a pawnsy scheme, look it now 20 years later, only wish i got in at 5 cents :(
4005 2018-01-09 19:43:26 Crazy thing about crypto currency to digital security and encryption as those topics deserve within the context of the biz

4008 2018-01-09 19:43:17 Thanks!!
4009 2018-01-09 19:43:08 cardano. but I didnt sell much because It is one to hold
4010 2018-01-09 19:43:07 I think maybe $1k. Others think 5-10k..which is hard to fathom.
4011 2018-01-09 19:43:07 It should. It's a valid, working product, unlike 95% of the rest of crypto projects.
4012 2018-01-09 19:43:05 yes but trading crypto is unvailable
4013 2018-01-09 19:42:57 That case deserves even more digging than we were able to give it. Journalists interested in crypto should DM me.
4014 2018-01-09 19:42:55 Firstly, I am not an insider. Secondly, if you are solely relying on a youtuber in crypto you should really start making an effort. @CryptosR_Us is doing a GREAT job, for both insiders and non-insiders. I use him as a pitcher, then I do my research, THEN I invest. You should too.

4017 2018-01-09 19:42:52 Being in the crypto world is scary and at the same time very challenging and interesting  It’s hard to explain, It’s a speciel feeling what it does to you  If I find the answer I’ll let you know 
4018 2018-01-09 19:42:51 Congrats!!! I never had a twitter account or a YouTube account ....However, I do now just to follow you!!! Great crypto advise

4023 2018-01-09 19:42:34 No JM, you are harming crypto with your endless, obvious shilling and promoting endless shit coins. You have gone from a respected leader in this space, to the biggest joke crypto has ever seen. You are now a meme.

Everybody is thinking Bitcoin Private will be $2K a coin.  1 ZCL gets 1 Bitcoin private as well.  Right now ZCL is at $200.  Backdoor way to get more Bitcoin Private.  Only 3M ZCL in cir

4034 2018-01-09 19:42:03 Wash trading isn't illegal on crypto. Sugar and other commodities are under different classifications and laws. Sadly, there is no law or statute that you can point to that states that crypto falls in the same categories, it is legal... for now.

4037 2018-01-09 19:41:56 No they were not tweeting about the wrong site. That was due to them being blocked by #MEW who it appears actually do have a problem, like the others #Blue have called out. Watch for more to come very soon.
4038 2018-01-09 19:41:47 Why?  It's not even a crypto currency.
4039 2018-01-09 19:41:47 Shout out the hottest queen in crypto! 
4040 2018-01-09 19:41:47 this is gonna be the new big thing for how companies make a quick buck by manipulating their stock prices. "okay, here's the plan: do a quick buyback, announce entry into crypto, then short like nobody's shorted before"
4041 2018-01-09 19:41:45 Thanks
4042 2018-01-09 19:41:41 Crypto. That’s pretty much it.
4043 2018-01-09 19:41:39 Pardon my ignorance for not keeping up with crypto news. However, in the replies you mention its PoC, so am I correct in saying it hasn't been pushed to the public yet?
4044 2018-01-09 19:41:37 damn! my reaction was too fast too
4045 2018-01-09 19:41:30 Thanks

4048 2018-01-09 19:41:27 @CodeAndCloth Thank you for having the LA crew at your Crypto Event last night. Great to hear you speak about the moral and integrity of the crypto world, it's more than just making money!

4076 2018-01-09 19:39:20 true but they care about encryption and privacy already tho, so why not crypto? I feel you on ICO tho...they feel scammy by nature 
4077 2018-01-09 19:39:20 Oh ffs, all you people asking what ASB-LT is on every one of David’s tweets, just go away and get out of trading crypto!! This question is being asked AND answered every 3 replies!!

I know nothing about VPNs etc but recently put a small amount of money into some crypto currencies & was told I shouldn't do that unless I had a VPN cause my computer would bet hacked if I bought crypto.

4155 2018-01-09 19:35:04 thats why you need to know who these people are, let them talk on youtube channel. Lets check their bio. as a smart investor you should know where are they registered. what are the crypto rules and laws there. they can easily get shut down by SEC for example. #b3coin
4156 2018-01-09 19:35:01 Solid analysis of tax issues for cryptocurrency. Tax has been an afterthought in crypto circles for too long, and some investors will pay the IRS big $$$ this April as a result.
4157 2018-01-09 19:35:01 Crypto
4158 2018-01-09 19:34:57 It’s like playing with fire  ....don’t get burned .. in just waiting on tron and verge to hit 1.00 so I can get the tattoos for being crypto millionaire

4161 2018-01-09 19:34:49 Isn’t crypto currency just the equivalent of in-house strip club bucks
4162 2018-01-09 19:34:46 What other exchanges will wire to a bank account? Please.
4163 2018-01-09 19:34:46 Bonjour je vois que tu a l’air assez calé j’aimerai te demander ce que tu pense du ripple perso . Tks
4164 2018-01-09 19:34:45 i'll require 3,000 a day plus expenses RT @IllinoisAlex I need a #bitcoin mentor to show me how to spread this crypto out. My shit been sitting  (growing) for some weeks idle.
4165 2018-01-09 19:34:40 Luckily I started using it right from when I got into crypto. I rebuilt my entire trading history so it's a record right from day 1 for me. It's quite an investment for the license but more than worth it in the grand scheme of things.
4166 2018-01-09 19:34:35 Been waiting forever
4167 2018-01-09 19:34:32 There is already crypto for this though we just gotta pressure companies to use it

4169 2018-01-09 19:34:30 If segwit is a disease then yes.
4170 2018-01-09 19:34:27 UPZS should accept bitcoin just like ELAY and just announce some crypto coin as perks for regular customers. More revenue and more orders for frozen pizza
4171 2018-01-09 19:34:23 They don't allow US presale token participation
4172 2018-01-09 19:34:16 (going crypto - like going postal, but driven insane by people pushing coins - argh)

4175 2018-01-09 19:34:08 I seem to have a trickier question: how is LN (not natural logarithm but “innovation” we call banks nowadays) p2p?? Don’t even pretend btc is #bitcoin. It’s a failed experiment to make a spacecraft a ford. Sham. Thanks goodness we have the true #BITCOIN alive. It’s #Bitcoincash!!
4176 2018-01-09 19:34:06 Monopoly was just crypto questions.....

4180 2018-01-09 19:33:46 Pas de problème !
4181 2018-01-09 19:33:37 Americans thought Hillary was the only one under FBI investigation, that was false. Many Independents voted for Trump because they thought she was a crook because of the FBI investigation. If they knew what we know now, the outcome would have been different.
4182 2018-01-09 19:33:34 2k satoshis? Yes that's def gonna happen.

4197 2018-01-09 19:32:31 $KODK following $LFIN pattern. Will have a huge gap up tomorrow. We'll play key resistance and support levels. 5.80 support held, 6.70 resistance followed by 8 then 10...there is no tops to these pump and dump crypto plays short term

4204 2018-01-09 19:31:58 yeah, I got into XRP late, at $0.18. So only had 1,200% return in the last 6 months. How’d BTC do?
4205 2018-01-09 19:31:57 I’ve been researching pac for about a week now and never would I expect them to give me an address to send coins. Thanks I’ll go on telegram.

4210 2018-01-09 19:31:37 trying to find a site like Trading Views which include lots of technical indicators but offer many more crypto that TV...any ideas? to check charts on small cryptos..
4211 2018-01-09 19:31:16 That is the million dollar question! With the market hype & all the new people entering the space, I think it's going to be awhile. The exchanges can't even handle new traders because everyone wants to trade crypto! #CryptoInsanity

4213 2018-01-09 19:31:03 Cardano and Tron have no working product at all... But they are in top 10. It might sound weird to you but the crypto market is not only about utility, more about speculation on future implementations and improvements.

4218 2018-01-09 19:30:42 very interesting developments as we see big dogs starting to develop specific crypto offerings via #blockchain technology.  ie $KODK & $GS could be a negative on the first movers that thought they would have ample time to build out network after getting funded via ICO like $OSTK
4219 2018-01-09 19:30:40 Early year slow down.  Will start heating up again once big announcements and product launches start taking place
4220 2018-01-09 19:30:36 Man, in June 2017 my brother told me crypto currency wasn't a viable option and if it was people with far more intelligence and capital that I would be diving in....hmmm
4221 2018-01-09 19:30:35 When it comes to crypto I like to use the tools that have gotten the attention of serious breakers (like Tavis Ormandy) so usually my suggestion is LastPass .... but personally I use 1Password which from what i can tell is just as solid.
4222 2018-01-09 19:30:34 Transferwise have a clause in their terms which says that users can not use their borderless bank account for anything to do with Bitcoin / crypto currencies. I found out today after I opened my account.  #hypocrisy #XRP

4228 2018-01-09 19:30:08 Definitely! Haha

4231 2018-01-09 19:29:59 @theonevortex My words too. If bitcoin collapses, all the crypto empire & its related distributed values fall down as well.
4232 2018-01-09 19:29:59 If you haven't noticed, people want gains more than the truth in crypto. I bought xvg for $0.02 so to hell with the truth. I'm up!

4245 2018-01-09 19:28:58 Here's where it gets interesting, read Novagratz is starting a crypto bank called galaxy digital, hes invest in AST, if they were to be used together that would be massive :)
4246 2018-01-09 19:28:55 Crypto currency seems like the way to go rn 
4247 2018-01-09 19:28:54 They were eavesdropping on our crypto conversation and set out to disrupt us.

It's succeeding.
4248 2018-01-09 19:28:47 elaborate? 1/ nobody really knows how crypto will perform during a downturn, and past price movement of say Bitcoin doesn't look negatively correlated w/ equities; 2/ most ICO's are essentially shitty low-cap equities
4249 2018-01-09 19:28:46 eind 2019 RAF ?? ok dat is een hele lange termijn voorspelling in crypto termen. Wat denk je van Q1 2018 ? 5-8 ct ?

4251 2018-01-09 19:28:39 How do you calculate it's market cap ?
4252 2018-01-09 19:28:39 True. Some new protocols are now better for privacy, but coinmixing works just fine on any crypto with low fees.
4253 2018-01-09 19:28:37 Really man, vrc too!!!!

4259 2018-01-09 19:28:05 Good Read.... It exactly states why I think Bitcoin will not be worth what it is because the computational power and block processing which IMO should mark the worth of Crypto rather than the financial transactions is very outdated compated to other cryptos.

4296 2018-01-09 19:25:12 the fact that Ripple can be used to move any currency, it would be ideal to move different crypto liabilities between exchanges. You could move your ‘bitcoin’ from Bitstamp to Kraken in seconds. Would instantly flatten price differentials.

4305 2018-01-09 19:24:02 I know of people who made stupid decisions in crypto currency
4306 2018-01-09 19:24:01 $KODK Eastman Kodak running as they are getting into the crypto game,announce licensing partnership to launch KODAKOne and KODAKCoin, a photo-centric cryptocurrency. Are you kidding me?
4307 2018-01-09 19:23:56 Cryptocurrency but the currency is cool rocks and the crypto is we keep our cool rock club a secret from people we don't like
4308 2018-01-09 19:23:51 Hopefully some kitties don't kill it! Sorry had to, joking, love my ETH.
4309 2018-01-09 19:23:46 Which exchanges is $WAN hitting?
4310 2018-01-09 19:23:45 Is it still. Good buy?
4311 2018-01-09 19:23:36 i tried its not working
4312 2018-01-09 19:23:26 Hat tip to @Cameron for $bat . It is heading for the moon  . Also  leaving the financials aside, what a super project for us to be a part of ! @brave #crypto
4313 2018-01-09 19:23:18 Buy district0x (DNT) RECOMMENDED crypto
4314 2018-01-09 19:23:17 I noticed; If you are a person who can't listen a song till the end...Then you should never buy crypto currencies #BTG #SC #Burstcoin #BTC #Ethereum #Monero #CryptoNews #cryptomonnaie #invest #RetweeetPlease #KNOWLEDGE

Thanks!
4318 2018-01-09 19:23:10 Any cash you get out of crypto currency is a bonus lol

4320 2018-01-09 19:23:09 How long does it take to withdraw @ignition_coin from crypto bridge and deposit to stocks exchange? I still dod not recieve my order??
4321 2018-01-09 19:23:08 Is Ethereum considered an alt?

4325 2018-01-09 19:22:58 haha It came from the stock market, when things start to turn to shit, the forum threads get ugly

1 problem in crypto right now is bulk newbies who have no idea - usually they'd get a bit of advice but those with experience are busy trading for great profit & need to focus on it
4326 2018-01-09 19:22:58 Wrong...crypto beat all including gold $btc $eth $ltc
4327 2018-01-09 19:22:53 $salt ready for moon @SaltLending #btc #salt #crypto
4328 2018-01-09 19:22:52 Or you can show some respect for a pioneer of crypto, and quit pushing your scammy coin with a plagiarized whitepaper.
4329 2018-01-09 19:22:52 Take some time to redo activities that you enjoy most. That will get you a great boost in energy and clear your head. $crypto is here to stay and there will always be great trade opportunities
4330 2018-01-09 19:22:48 While the world waits for big business to accept $btc as payment, the developers at Tenx $pay are working on a solution that allows your crypto to be converted to fiat and used immediately. Def worth keeping on your crypto radar. #solutions $ltc $dash $eth $xrp
4331 2018-01-09 19:22:27 Example: Investing 1ETH into an ICO might yield a 15x return, 2 months after investing.  Alternatively, instead if you had HOLD’d 1ETH and it rose 5% per day, you would have 18x return.  Thus, the ICO would be less profitable! #bitcoin #ico #crypto #ethereum #fomo #blockchain
4332 2018-01-09 19:22:25 OMG , I remember that,  I don’t think this laughing matter, I bought WAX for one ETH value then ,$298 but I Could sell WAX almost $4 k today
4333 2018-01-09 19:22:11 At least they want you to believe that. Crypto has become a real life game of big brother because It removes the need for a centralized power, but the pauls of the world have other plans.
4334 2018-01-09 19:21:58 Looks like golds about to breakout $XAUUSD #gold #metals
4335 2018-01-09 19:21:57 No brainer $NEBL 
4336 2018-01-09 19:21:56 @CryptoUntether  thanks for answer Mr Ver..
4337 2018-01-09 19:21:55 ok thx bro
4338 2018-01-09 19:21:53 Hahaha, el tema es poder decirlo en una frase antes de escribir páginas y páginas :), sino suena a crypto - mucho buzzwords, poco fundamento :)
4339 2018-01-09 19:21:37 Do ICO’s always give the best returns?!? Currently thinking seems to be ‘yes’, but the cost of locking your crypto up for several months comes at a cost…possibly higher than the ICO return? Interested to get @DiaryofaMadeMan 's view! #bitcoin #ico #crypto #ethereum #fomo
4340 2018-01-09 19:21:35 Few sell walls lol have you seen how many ?
4341 2018-01-09 19:21:29 Great crypto pun account mate I love it.
4342 2018-01-09 19:21:29 I appreciate the discourse, I know I'll never convince you. You are probably higher educated and have more experience in the field but I would challenge you to not write it off. The world doesn't have to reach consensus for change to be imminent. The free market will decide.
4343 2018-01-09 19:21:26 Hello Naija crypto lovers,

4346 2018-01-09 19:21:15 I'm currently in devolvement on trying to devolp a crypto currency. It'll be call BRIANCoin and will be limited to those people that purchase more then $100 in my store.
4347 2018-01-09 19:21:13 Which product???
4348 2018-01-09 19:21:09 1. have any of my crypto plays been wrong since I started making them public?

2. Buy $Mot and thank me later. Only on Bibox atm and being listed on Okex today sometime.

4349 2018-01-09 19:21:05 David Seaman bitches about censorship and first amendment rights, and censors me because I asked him to smoke a joint on his live stream YouTube. If it offended him why block? He smokes live everyday. Not a luciferian bot I'm awake and rich from crypto.  Sorry. #Fulcrum #maga
4350 2018-01-09 19:21:03 5 ETH.  NICE!  but what kinda laptop  :-)
4351 2018-01-09 19:21:02 Can you believe this @jimcramer?  $KODK joins the #crypto hype along with the likes of $LTEA $DPW and countess others "Hey we farted some blockchain"  do investors even read beyond the buzzwords or even understand what #blockchain is/how it can be used?
4352 2018-01-09 19:20:56 Losing money based on ignorance brings perspective in to focus quickly.
4353 2018-01-09 19:20:48 Finally broke 400 off the crypto. 500 I see by the end of the month.

4356 2018-01-09 19:20:25 Seriously. And people are not understanding the dangers of hype. It’s as if market manipulation is illegal in crypto.
4357 2018-01-09 19:20:24 Trying to work and watch the price of #NEO at the same time. Work is losing.
4358 2018-01-09 19:20:18 crypto is currently under research by many scholars. It “might” be one or the other, although no *final* ruling given yet until concluded.

4365 2018-01-09 19:20:01 Stop... Just stop. There is zero evidence of this. Users like you are causing the lack of support.
4366 2018-01-09 19:20:00 Going to double my investment on the next dip
4367 2018-01-09 19:19:59 I moved my shares to $ICX and $ZRX few moments after this post. did not regret it. Waiting for $wan listing and few funds to $Mana.
4368 2018-01-09 19:19:53 I also have some S9s. I ended up getting a cohost due to the amount of KWH I was needing. For whatever reason the L21s don't like being really cold. Unplugged a fan and they are performing as expected.
4369 2018-01-09 19:19:53 Seems like when he tweets it goes down so...
4370 2018-01-09 19:19:52 Sell target? What's that? ;] I'm still sitting here thinking about whether or not I want to pick up on the next dip LOLOLOLOL SHIT
4371 2018-01-09 19:19:51 $btc #bitcoin #crypto I mean is anyone watching this?I'm not a huge huge fan of H&S patterns, especially topping ones, but this is scary
4372 2018-01-09 19:19:48 I am not saying FB is looking at RDD. But it would be so much easer for FB to just invest in RDD then to try and build out their own crypto. They have bought a ton of small cap companies in the past. Not out of the question.
4373 2018-01-09 19:19:46 held VRC for a while, didnt know it dropped all the way down in rank 280 something on CMC......thats some upside potential.
4374 2018-01-09 19:19:45 I have set up the blockchain again...have not had the time. Too much work. Made my crypto tax...ugh
4375 2018-01-09 19:19:45 Absolutely not. And in related news, I'd like to announce the upcoming IPO of DerpCoin, the crypto-currency of choice for people with more money than sense.

4378 2018-01-09 19:19:21 Its funny how so many haters in Crypto that post FUDs when they miss the boat, makes me laugh so hard
4379 2018-01-09 19:19:20 Still undervalued imo, what do you think?
4380 2018-01-09 19:19:18 I'd bet you £50 that #youandyours will be full of broke & fleeced crypto investor victims in a year's time but if your cash is all in crypto you won't be able to pay up anyway! (BTW: I work in data all day long)
4381 2018-01-09 19:19:18 Never wrong taking profits
4382 2018-01-09 19:19:11 Pay attention to the implementation of the lightening network and atomic swaps. Reduces the validity of that argument..
4383 2018-01-09 19:19:08 2/ Instead this would be the best way to operate: Setup a clear communication framework that would be beneficial for the end-users in all aspects as priority one.
Implement this framework(gain agreement with other crypto project teams wheree possible.

4393 2018-01-09 19:18:39 I'm uni right now but really hope can start something of my own. Trying to achieve the dream. Your tweets have really helped me alot in learning about crypto still very much a newbie.
4394 2018-01-09 19:18:32 Many of these crypto folks are gonna get burned. They may know the tech, but they don't understand the game they're playing. Two examples: valuing XRP based on BTC mkt cap despite their major differences in utility & being shocked about a Chinese company (Tron) plagiarizing lol.

4402 2018-01-09 19:17:54 Public is best however only should it effect the public. If it is internal issue with no direct effect to the public then notify them on the QT is more appropriate I would think. If its #Blue it's true, once again! Well done Uni

4410 2018-01-09 19:17:04 When I first started crypto I had one bittrex account. Now I'm verified on 5 and always looking for the next thing to invest in. Don't get lazy sticking to one exchange..
4411 2018-01-09 19:16:37 $KODK Crypto camera? haha
4412 2018-01-09 19:16:25 Through all the people I've met in this crypto game, we've experienced many failures in the beginning.
4413 2018-01-09 19:16:21 SHould I buy in now?
4414 2018-01-09 19:16:15 If you bought and didn't stake them, then it's your own fault. I bought at 100 sats and was still in profit at 10 sats.. Actually I was 3x at 1 sat. Still holding
4415 2018-01-09 19:16:12 There are so many speculations and accusations flying around. From the latest days of trade it still has good support.
The future of cryptocurrencies lies in their ability to transcend from crypto to real world applications and the upcoming TaxRegulations - both beyond our power.
4416 2018-01-09 19:16:09 "#WePower will incorporate its #crypto trading #GreenEnergy platform into #Elering’s Estfeed data exchange. Nonetheless, It will direct proof-of-concept system for Estonia and explicate nationwide energy consumption and production data on the #blockchain"
4417 2018-01-09 19:16:02 Agreed, so from your own statement value is created by removing the need for trust. If you trust the network then trust in individuals and businesses is not required.
4418 2018-01-09 19:15:59 I knew I saw that angry thing coming  yesterday  $xrp ~ same I believe it was with $XVG @ one point ~ truly the thing crypto nightmares are made of  (until you’ve seen it a few times and can plan accordingly) 
4419 2018-01-09 19:15:57 Don't turn 1 bad trade into 2. HODL until it recovers... #Crypto
4420 2018-01-09 19:15:57 They are an analog to Tethers. But they are also an analogy to crypto , which is just an unpegged eurodollar system, aka decentralised money creation.
4421 2018-01-09 19:15:57 Such as funding bitcoin and crypto startups to develop censorship resistant tech? I'd say he's doing more than you or I.
4422 2018-01-09 19:15:36 great episode! but governments' crypto, it is not a rebranding, it is the first step to a system where no cash anymore and they can monitor all the transactions.

4436 2018-01-09 19:14:41 didn't we know enough then?
oh wait, apparently the whole scumbag thing was a secret hidden in plain sight.

4442 2018-01-09 19:14:14 Here's a new thing: blockchain firms or ICOs reaching out to crypto beat reporters to ask if you want to be an advisor. I've received 3 (all on LinkedIn) in past month. the answer I hope all reporters would give is: no! reporters can't do that.

4449 2018-01-09 19:13:38 And crypto has built a global network for value to be traded. Your argument is akin to people wondering how you can own bitcoin if you can't actually hold it. Can you hold the internet?
4450 2018-01-09 19:13:34 Could you provide a reasonably sound explanation of crypto currencies and the Blockchain if asked to, to someone who actually knew what they were?

4473 2018-01-09 19:12:23 I'm not saying all cryptos have a profound use, but I would argue that quite a lot of them have real use cases. Your also implying that a decentralized network / ecosystem with public access has no value and is not something that was "built".

4503 2018-01-09 19:10:36 Zijn het storingen? 

Misschien worden banken elk jaar harder geconfronteerd door hackers. Het systeem is zwaar verouderd.

In crypto wordt het beestje bij de naam genoemd. Een hack bij een bank heet vanaf het begin af aan al een storing.

4525 2018-01-09 19:08:31 I see Blockchain as a utility for those that can't afford the infrastructure to commerce and have access to systems that would otherwise be out of their reach. I also see it as a censorship resistant tool in regards to content, and necessary for all future data storage.

4593 2018-01-09 19:04:42 It's pretty low so it's possible to get more :) I think a good amount is 100k :P But it's all about how much you can risk and how financially stable you'll be without that money if you do invest more.

4604 2018-01-09 19:03:47 When it comes to these crypto currencies you have to be very careful which 1 you exchange your money for because alot of them are hype,
I only trust bitcoin & bitconnect token and even then the golden rule is to only invest what you can afford to afford to loose.

4609 2018-01-09 19:03:17 I don’t think we disagree on that. Mostly I just think your characterization of crypto as a misallocation of capital is missing the point. It assumes the system won’t survive after this period of speciation and growth comes to an end.

4617 2018-01-09 19:02:45 In Crypto: Fighting your natural instinct to FOMO is just as important as your natural instinct to panic when things don't seem right. Entry point is KEY in order to profit & reduce loss of risk, just as is giving coins room to breathe even after low dips with bounce potential.

4620 2018-01-09 19:02:10 underrated crypto, competing with ARK though ain't it?
4621 2018-01-09 19:02:01 Source goes on to say that HOLD because big news announcements will be released before end of January which will drive price to new highs. 
4622 2018-01-09 19:01:59 No worries. I made my trade at ~4160 sats and the idea is that if it drops to 3800 sats and isn't showing recovery that I'll exit the trade at a loss. 

The trade is based on XLM's price action itself, but considerations are also related to why I felt it originally pumped.
4623 2018-01-09 19:01:55 I meant to compare the rate of growth to tech companies not that they are actually equity in said cryptos. You don't see a need or use case for transfer of value outside of our existing antiquated system? Do you not see value in decentralized data storage and content sharing?

The nonce and network ID is the same as the tx you want to cancel and you set the gas price much higher so it gets mined before

4654 2018-01-09 18:59:50 I think you’re smart enough and I’m smart enough to know that wouldn’t be the case for someone with as much knowledge as you have.

4683 2018-01-09 18:57:43 @PascalCoin : In crypto world, unless you hype, market cap won't increase and unless market cap increases adoption won't increase as people will not be aware of the product.
4684 2018-01-09 18:57:42 Thats where we differ. I think BTC will be around in the future, but either way I'll be okay. I only invest in crypto money I'm comfortable losing. My crypto portfolio could go to 0 tomorrow and I could still make a down payment. It would be a bonus if my crypto investment helped
4685 2018-01-09 18:57:34 Bithumb and other Korean exchanges trading XRP for 3.93$ and BTC at 23K.  We are getting a very raw deal.  This sounds very fishy.  Very unfair and manipulative.  Wall Street is alive and well in the Crypto world.  Jamie Diamond must have found a way to make $$$ on this.
4686 2018-01-09 18:57:29 Do not buy in FOMO (fear of missing out)
4687 2018-01-09 18:57:22 Oh how the crypto space brings us all together. Personally I dont see banks going away anytime soon. In this long run of the banks not going away Ripple and XRP will do great things in the banking sector

4690 2018-01-09 18:57:17 I totally agree with you. $btc dominance is at 34% (all time low).  The moment btc starts rising again, all these new profits will start going back into btc. Many new/lucky investors in alts are going to find out what term full market cycle really means

4720 2018-01-09 18:55:24 It could be compared to the skepticism the public had of the internet, smartphones, and other advanced tech. Who saw APPLE at $879B in 2000? If one global company can equal the entire crypto ecosystem then where's the surprise. Essentially cryptos are tech companies...

4739 2018-01-09 18:54:20 no. Decentralised in that it was entirely removed from central control. Eurodollars broke the system, and eurodollars were issued entirely outside of the control of the Fed. It was a shadow banking phenom. Crypto is shadowbanking too.

4752 2018-01-09 18:53:37 PSA: Brave is the most secure web browser in the game and it has Metamask, which is the most secure way to transact on the Ethereum network in a web browser. You should start using it for all your crypto activities. Protect your wealth!
4753 2018-01-09 18:53:27 Only important setting regarding cancelled order is market order, under signal settings. If you don't use market orders for signals, your bid is usually too low and the order gets cancelled eventually.

4763 2018-01-09 18:52:09 Underestimated the market potential maybe? When you think of the size of global industries and commerce... $800B is barely a drop in the bucket. Even if Blockchain is not the most efficient use, how many companies / businesses utilize unnecessary software/ systems.

4770 2018-01-09 18:51:44 I like 5-HTP for falling asleep easier and earlier.
Only thing important to know is to not combine it with SSRIs. Other than that it's well-tolerated and causes no dependence.
It also stabilizes the mood as 5-HTP is converted to serotonine.
L-Tryptophane -> 5-HTP -> Serotonine
4771 2018-01-09 18:51:40 I think she's implying that, even with the slight dip over the last week, XRP is still up over 30,000%. That's a factor of 20 over BTC's return over the same period, and more than 3x the closest top 10 crypto (Dash).

4807 2018-01-09 18:48:29 まったくです。

それがあった上で、安いコインのブームが成立してるんですよね。

取引量のないコインでいくら値上がりしても、売れないことも多々ありますし、リスクも大きい。
そういうコインを『積極的に』初心者にすすめてる人に待ったをかけることのどこが嫉妬なのかわかりません。
4808 2018-01-09 18:48:29 Honestly mine are pretty similar, probably not looking to build products, but everything else echoes my goals
4809 2018-01-09 18:48:28 I think max is £10k cash on a plane. This crypto stuff has money laundering written all over it though.
4810 2018-01-09 18:48:05 I do firmly believe that the project is real and the plans are real. They have a CEO who is a 3 time Asia Forbes 30 under 30 and Jack Ma protege. I just think they grew too fast, too soon and Justin's inexperience in crypto started to show. I think time will fix the drama.
4811 2018-01-09 18:47:43 Crypto is a purely speculative market, theres not a single project that actually works properly yet
4812 2018-01-09 18:47:42 You deserve it for making the best chocolate in the world, so I heard from @DannyGumballs maybe you can make a trade: crypto for chocto.
4813 2018-01-09 18:47:41 $KORE / $BTC ( FREE SIGNAL )

Target 1: 65k
Target 2: 85k
Target 3: 105k
Target 4: 120k 
Target 5: 155k

Kore is on a clear uptrend.  Daily and Week charts shows upward movements. We can expect a nice run.

4817 2018-01-09 18:47:16 @CoinMarketCap I’m leaving you because I dislike excluding Korean market from this global crypto market cap. It’s like fake market cap now. Censorship is bad, using live coin watch from now on. Please don’t backtrack and include Korea into market cap just keep doing what you do

4833 2018-01-09 18:45:54 Kodak cryptocoin proof of work is called an ISO. Each crypto F-stop, it gets lower/harder and that’s how it prevents bubbles and ourperforms fiat currency. Mining new coin is called developing and printing.

4854 2018-01-09 18:43:40 Strategically you can better leave the best for later. Any partnership builds trust and empowers the community and price. But some crypto's have build better formats to post announcement. Overall I am still a hodler and believe in TRON.

4867 2018-01-09 18:42:21 I don't think RCN will hold those gains though. Everytime it pumps, it comes right back down. So frustrating, definitely a slow and steady gains coin.

4885 2018-01-09 18:40:43 $1 in the next hour ;)  HA but truly I think it will keep inching up a little as more and more people learn about it. I predict within a couple of weeks it will spike hard to 200-250sats then correct to maybe 150 or so, give or take. $LINDA @Lindaproject #crypto $trx $xvg
4886 2018-01-09 18:40:36 I wouldn't care if you sold trx at $5. You sold way too early. If you do the math of 22m/10b with bitcoins current eval you find out that trx is worth $33 when it has a similar market cap. This is Chinese crypto and your dumb to underestimate the Chinese when it comes to crypto.

My mistake, is the Wanchain ICO price (0.30)
4892 2018-01-09 18:39:56 You're not. It's why the USG (SEC?) will invariably require crypto exchanges to declare a root, incorporated, authority on these systems. (If they're not made totally illegal)

There are governments in other countries who have no credibility when it comes to whether or not money will be in people's bank accounts tomorrow. Crypto may not find adoption in the US but outside our borders it will.
4908 2018-01-09 18:38:48 They have partnered up with over 50 different altcoins.  This is meaningless.  TRX needs new leadership.  Or some leadership for that matter.

I made mistake and won't do the same.
Trust #altcoins but always packed a percentage of #bitcoin in your portfolio ! #crypto are mad but it is just the beginning
4932 2018-01-09 18:37:05 I see people asking others on shortcuts in crypto to earn as much as they can . That’s not how it works . Crypto IS the shortcut . $btc
4933 2018-01-09 18:37:01 I still have invites available to participate in the @LegolasExchange pre-sale/ICO. DM me with your email if you'd like an invite. An exchange like this is super needed in $crypto. Gonna #blowup

4940 2018-01-09 18:36:28 No problem. Hey, I'm a big supporter of certain projects/coins, and I would 100% do the same in your position. : )    The current state of crypto is, unfortunately, far too responsive to social media!

4950 2018-01-09 18:35:54 Personally, I don't like when the tokens are that high. That's just my own opinion and I could very well be wrong in thinking that way. As far as that coin, it checks some boxes you'd want in an ICO but realize lending coins like this have a bad rep in crypto right now.
4951 2018-01-09 18:35:46 Started trading Crypto almost 3 weeks ago. Liquidated all my equities and bought 0.7 BTC (two days before it flash 'crashed'). Have since tripled my initial investment but above everything else learned so many valuable lessons. Loving the crypto journey.
4952 2018-01-09 18:35:45 Amazed how you kept pace with VB and even made him pause and think. @laurashin take a bow, you are truly a crypto expert in one sense. 

I am sure @VitalikButerin will also agree.

4961 2018-01-09 18:35:00 $colx coin could be really interesting. There are some similarities with $xvg, however $colx cost only $0,017. You can buy them at coinexchange.

4964 2018-01-09 18:34:33 Defenitley not putting all of my eggs in any basket. I see crypto as an alternative asset to allocate about 10% of my saving towards and hope it creates better returns than my 401K. You've always gotta diversify to reduce your risk. But my goal in trading alts is to make more BTC
4965 2018-01-09 18:34:32 You right
4966 2018-01-09 18:34:28 That's me when I bought some and price drops below my purchase price. Have to learn wait.

4981 2018-01-09 18:33:27 It's honestly anti-user that so many exchanges exclusively use BTC for crypto trading pairs. BTC is so expensive and slow to send that people are trading to LTC to send, then trading back to BTC just to trade for other coins.
4982 2018-01-09 18:33:24 I’m not hating at all wolf. But I’ve followed you for a long ass time and you’ve literally never ONLY talked about Bitcoin. That is why I feel like something weird is going on.

4985 2018-01-09 18:33:17 It all started with me passing along some info to a couple buddies who have large holdings in case they wanted to liquidate their positions. Regardless of truth or just "fud", the crypto markets do NOT respond well to things like this.

4988 2018-01-09 18:33:03 I've never heard a single person explain how this supposed "crypto crash" is going to take place. Decentralized market means millions of people in different time zones have to sell all at once... and no one re-buy. Possible? Not really.

4993 2018-01-09 18:32:48 Bitcoin is going to die. Look at transaction fees. Look at transaction time. It's the AOL of crypto
4994 2018-01-09 18:32:46 "...vous ne pourrez pas effectuer de transferts de crypto-monnaie depuis l'extérieur de la plateforme Revolut, par exemple venant de portefeuilles externes. Nous travaillons dans ce sens et espérons que ce sera possible le plus vite possible." Vivement 
4995 2018-01-09 18:32:20 and so many cant not even register on coinexchange or cant move or deposit their coins from wallet or other exchange. watch them cry

4998 2018-01-09 18:32:17 So what are the plans? The crypto rocket ship is gathering momentum but is skincoin going actually going to take off?

5001 2018-01-09 18:31:55 Then alts will take a little hit. And my btc stash will hopefully even me out. Can I ask you why this season you have ZERO interest in Alts? I feel like you went on vacation and missed out on some accumulation and now only talk about Bitcoin. Weird times.
5002 2018-01-09 18:31:46 I am interested. And what is even more interesting is the amount of people who are interested. The crypto community is awesome !
5003 2018-01-09 18:31:44 @CryptosR_Us I saw your recent video, what's your beef with salt?I know you like Ethlend, but I think you need to look into the mechanics of how #salt loans work against crypto collateral. Also look up retail value of $salt versus market value.  Would love to see a comparison vid
5004 2018-01-09 18:31:40 ブロックチェーン技術は素晴らしいと思うが、現状では仮想通貨は投機目的でしかないため、正直コインの性能などはどうでもいい。

5030 2018-01-09 18:29:54 #ripple #xrp soooo sad this shit bank coin was created to take down decentralized crypto currency and people are buying it. One good thing we had and now the banks are destroying again.
5031 2018-01-09 18:29:52 That wouldn’t be a problem! All kudos for you if you are right.
5032 2018-01-09 18:29:49 So it's a regulated form of Crypto currency
5033 2018-01-09 18:29:43 There's much more to it of course, but safety is one of my main concerns.
5034 2018-01-09 18:29:42 Only if they let you buy using crypto. Keep the value in the new system. Starve the old.

5075 2018-01-09 18:27:00 Financial freedom. Lots of money is also nice. Ironically getting into crypto for money alone in the past would often  have meant panicking and bailing on the  big blow outs. When you have faith that the concept is ultimately more important, you're more likely to hodl.

5085 2018-01-09 18:26:26 Thanks Alex. Is this something you have done previously? I am just very conscious of paying securely as this is my first time with any crypto purchase
5086 2018-01-09 18:26:24 the issue I see, is that a lot of people in crypto just use it for money making/daytrade without knowing what the coins/tokens do, do you think that could hinder/hurt the project or help it?
5087 2018-01-09 18:26:22 so 7/1 at 2 pm Brussel time it broke out from 2600 sat to appr. 5000 with a volume of 815 btc max. it was just a feeler move. the falling wedge back to 3500 is almost complete. volume dropped back to 130 btc so it's coming. target 12 - 20K satoshi. BUY NOW for 4x minimum

5098 2018-01-09 18:25:43 But how about you keep telling everyone to sell the crypto with actual use and partnerships and buy the one that got dropped by steam Microsoft and countless others because that one obviously will make more for some unknown reason has to be worth more as less people use it
5099 2018-01-09 18:25:40 @bitfinex I suggest you implement a system where clients that have been locked out of their accounts via 2FA can reset it themselves via email. This will speed up things! #bitfinex #crypto #exchange @paoloardoino @claudiaLagorio
5100 2018-01-09 18:25:37 Looking for new crypto currency ICO

So I guess I'd have plenty for personal projects without ever actually quitting crypto.

5106 2018-01-09 18:25:22 Yeah and i love that, nobody knows when market will fall a little. That way, you can be sure you right, wise guy.
5107 2018-01-09 18:25:20 If they weren't serial robbers of the taxpayer I wouldn't be so offended by them. However, I accept that they shall always exist in some form, I just do not see anything useful coming from their presence in Crypto....but I am open to the possibility that I could be wrong.
5108 2018-01-09 18:25:05 That's the reason i mentioned @_pivx more than twice to you. Pivx is untracable & hides your holdings value. Next step is #zdex a decentralized Bitcoin <-> $PIVX exchange, & @UNITY_UDX as decentralized "localbitcoins" . Be your own bank is more than a phrase & btc lacks #privacy

5113 2018-01-09 18:24:32 For him personally NO. For the market and bringing on stricter regulation YES. I can tell from your adjectives, you’re excited. Personally, I get my sex for free. And if you hold crypto for that reason, you‘re the problem.
5114 2018-01-09 18:24:25 $2300 invested in crypto flipped into $7k, that’s $5k in 3 weeks. I’ll take it

1. Being invested in different spaces makes you more flexible for the market

2. The market often has uneven peaks that may not affect each of your holdings. 

3. It could save your sanity.
5123 2018-01-09 18:23:54 If crypto is not a sizeable chunk of your investment portfolio at this point, I don't know what else to tell you. Clear no-brainer
5124 2018-01-09 18:23:54 Quick note on $XRP: The meteoric rise of community built coins ($PAC, $DIME, and more) raises the profile and narrative of the decentralized and grassroots movements of crypto. As a result, we are seeing a lot of FUD/Criticisms of $XRP, and so we are seeing current bearishness.
5125 2018-01-09 18:23:47 I remember woke up at 1 am to contribute to ICON ico...best move ever.
5126 2018-01-09 18:23:37 If you reduce your expenses by 50% does that mean you make more?

Maybe not, but it sure gives you more money to invest in crypto
5127 2018-01-09 18:23:36 It looks like a new business plan for struggling companies to start their own crypto currency to boost their share value despite having nothing to do with money or cryptography. Parusscoin anyone?

5155 2018-01-09 18:21:46 What is interesting is that in December the full Crypto market cap was around mid 600's, now it is mid 700s.  This means the money moved to other coins or new coins.  In my opinion you have a lot of uneducated investors trading on speculation.  Really a reactive marketplace.
5156 2018-01-09 18:21:44 The power of crypto smart contracts is often overstated. Limits to consensus need to be considered.

5167 2018-01-09 18:21:15 Originally I created Binance acct to get ZRX and TRX. But now I found my newest buy that's not on bittrex: Kiber $KNC. An exchange similar to ZRX and outpacing slightly faster. As long as exchanges are suffering traffic, this field is going to explode.

5169 2018-01-09 18:21:09 I wish food and shelter for everyone. Crypto trading can do that against all odds. We all know what our government really does for us.
5170 2018-01-09 18:21:07 Nuttin wrong with being straight forward. Besides, crypto is the future. Eventually these currencies will be for those transactions, you’re just ahead of the game.

5175 2018-01-09 18:20:50 I have no doubt Jeff already knows long time that BCH is / will be the preferred crypto payment option..
5176 2018-01-09 18:20:44 do you have any recommended links for learning deeper on the $DRGN ICO’s... still getting my feet wet with the process
5177 2018-01-09 18:20:43 Doesn't it bother you that Ripple is the banker's coin? We want to keep things decentralized and not give the crypto market back to central banks. That would destroy the whole idea
5178 2018-01-09 18:20:43 Personally I’d cash out a solid amount but not nearly all of it
5179 2018-01-09 18:20:43 Phishing may be the #1 problem in crypto right now. After seeing what happened with the EtherDelta phishing hack, I would encourage all crypto traders to get a hardware wallet, and install Cryptonite or other phishing prevention extensions.

5181 2018-01-09 18:20:38 #xvg #xvgfam i believe verge is the future of crypto currency and as time goes on the world will get a chance to see that! Until then we can do nothing but encourage and help the cause

5198 2018-01-09 18:19:31 There is no such thing as real privacy. In this digital world it’s all just perceived privacy. Only privacy coins in the world are made of silver and gold. I don’t believe in crypto privacy.

5205 2018-01-09 18:19:07 people panicked and started to sell cheap , makin $BTC and other crypto lose some value , but that's it , and now back on the rise as always
5206 2018-01-09 18:19:07 My current goal is to continue trading and taking profits into $BTC until I have the fiat equivalent of $10M.  From there I will continue to invest in crypto, but reinvest a portion into rental real estate and quit my day job.  Aiming to reach this in 3 years.

5218 2018-01-09 18:18:18 Haha thank you very much!! Yes I am talking about buying with cash. So I need to get onto platforms that aren’t taking any new clients hahaha!!
5219 2018-01-09 18:18:17 Lol I feel bad for you if you believe this, get out of the crypto game
5220 2018-01-09 18:18:16 sockpuppet this, bought accounts that. 

there are legitimate reasons aome of these people are using BCH. 

I still live in fiat and just save in BTC. others that live in crypto need cheap and fast transactions now.

hopefully people come back when BTC solves the scaling issues.
5221 2018-01-09 18:18:12 Listening to The Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast. Some really good shows. There is one from March last test called Crypto Show with Vinny Lingham which explains how Bitcoin in perspective
5222 2018-01-09 18:18:07 Banks have no problem with people housing drug money but money made from crypto currency trading is an issue? This is why people need to get in on these coins now.

5228 2018-01-09 18:17:44 If you truly believe in BTC as a long term store of value for the future would you ever want to take everything out of it? 

I'm still a small fish just trying to accumulate as much BTC as possible. It'd be great if crypto money could help cover down payment on my first home
5229 2018-01-09 18:17:43 Well said John! That’s the beauty of crypto.
5230 2018-01-09 18:17:35 I have 3 crypto geeks working on this stuff for me so not sure. We are using a 4000 SF ware house to set it all up. It's fun. Good luck Andrew! I will look into multipool algo. I appreciate the advice. Thanks!

5239 2018-01-09 18:16:57 It takes time and effort to really capitalize on crypto for quick gains, if you are not thinking through your steps, you are just gambling.
5240 2018-01-09 18:16:57 Just a few short hours until BitconnectX boys and girls. I have my crypto locked and loaded to buy in.

5242 2018-01-09 18:16:53 I wish i knew i really do! But the crypto market is very uninformed and mislead due to fud and just inexperience at the moment but as time passes that will also change
5243 2018-01-09 18:16:51 BITCOIN ETF's - SEC crack down on Cypto's and ICO's - Two Asset Firms have quietly pulled two BITCOIN ETF's. This is occuring Globally - Gov'ts seeking to Crack Down, Close and etc. Crypto currencies and exchanges. BE CAREFULL on Specualting in Crypto's

5253 2018-01-09 18:16:15 I feel it’s better for a pump at moment with heavy buys to knock those walls down and leave them investors who sold to buy in at higher price

5258 2018-01-09 18:16:01 Doesn't matter. If you really believe in the technology long-term then short-term public sentiment should matter little. 

If anything, John's honesty is proof that crypto can deliver on its initial promises.
5259 2018-01-09 18:15:56 I think everyone’s TA has been wrong on $trx
5260 2018-01-09 18:15:55 So what crypto coin are they investing in
5261 2018-01-09 18:15:50 $DOT but technically speaking, it isn't a shitcoin
5262 2018-01-09 18:15:44 3D Programming mostly only needs up to Linear Algebra.
For machine learning and big data you need Statistics and Numerical Analysis.
For crypto you need number theory
etc etc etc
5263 2018-01-09 18:15:41 It's funny you sold because you realized wash trading in crypto is abundant. Ironically, it's actually not illegal because it's not a security. Also, hilarious it took you so long to see this. Welcome to understanding crypto! (Kinda)
5264 2018-01-09 18:15:37 Do you even understand what I was saying? Or understand what you are talking about!

5281 2018-01-09 18:14:36 The statement that Ripple will be bigger than Bitcoin is wrong. Ripple is already bigger than Bitcoin, people just don't know it yet. It has nothing to do with market cap.
5282 2018-01-09 18:14:33 Ive been a hodler since august and have never put a sell order! Patience will prevail. Sooner then later the sells will subside and our growth ultimately will continue.
I prefer steady growth as opposed to big pumps

5302 2018-01-09 18:12:58 1/ Okay, then you are asking the retailer to accommodate your currency which benefits them in no way.

For this scenario to work, prices would have to be denominated in dollars (or whatever the local currency is), converted to crypto at the moment of sale, billed in crypto and

5308 2018-01-09 18:12:32 Hi, why you think its have a future ?
5309 2018-01-09 18:12:29 No, I don’t for one. Your personal life is your business and no way effects your knowledge of crypto but could hurt your credibility but being honest is a virtue.
5310 2018-01-09 18:12:26 Im also astounded that it isnt .50+ but price only fluctuates based on sells/buys. I believe alot of new investors got stuck at .21-.25 and are jus trying to get there money back this the walls and holding price from climbing
5311 2018-01-09 18:12:24 Do you normally provide material support to things you don’t believe in?

5462 2018-01-09 18:01:01 but its not going up?waiting for something more?
5463 2018-01-09 18:00:56 Actually, often no position is best. Prior to the crypto rally I hadn't invested in anything on my own for several years; previous to that being ES/NQ futures a few years back, which was closed, and GC in 2012. Compulsion to trade does lead to problems, as does making job of it.
5464 2018-01-09 18:00:56 my study looked identical to your screen setup the other night with the same exchanges on screen. Lol. I even had my iPad and iPhone with crypto prices on the go until my wife told me to get a life!  Haha.

5468 2018-01-09 18:00:38 It adds to the “crypto guy in basement” allure 
5469 2018-01-09 18:00:35 Unless you're walking up to girls telling them you're a crypto billionaire when you're not, which is unlikely, then your game is not based on lies. 

Rather, it is based on emphasising your best points and minimising your worst ones.
5470 2018-01-09 18:00:29 Insane day for ripple XRP. I hope they will recover. And I am sure they will in time. But they need to pay close attention on Raiblocks they are climbing up in market cap. and a healthy rate. These companies have great potential. But which one will dominate?

5484 2018-01-09 17:59:28 Yes, if we all had crystal balls, we would have sold xrp in May and bought BTC, then sold BTC in December 10th to buy xrp and we'd be zillionaires. But my crystal ball is back ordered so I'm holding a crypto with a proven use case #xrpthestandard

5493 2018-01-09 17:58:51 A Big Alliance is going to happen this week with crypto currency. Due to the explosion of the crypto currency last year, The CEO of $COBI (Compass Biotechnologies Inc.) Rick Shykora announce a massive merger with bitcoin to help with the industry sectors.
5494 2018-01-09 17:58:46 I think the next puppy I get's name will be Crypto. Because it will be fascinating to watch, it's actions will make zero sense and it will probably destroy everything I own.
5495 2018-01-09 17:58:43 So I should buy crypto on Western exchanges and sell it on Asian exchanges?  Who is benefiting from the spread?  Bitcoin is Bitcoin wherever you are.  Are the markets subject to manipulation?

5497 2018-01-09 17:58:40 Why #Arcblock is unique and powerful ?

#Arcblock will be a game changer with massive growth.

5505 2018-01-09 17:57:40 the beautiful thing about crypto is that you'll have another opportunity to redeem yourself this week
5506 2018-01-09 17:57:37 Not should, it is. And Yeah, ofcourse. Otherwise it can never be what it’s for. That’s why it’s Just not for Crypto enthousiasts that Must have the decentralised aspect, like btc. Great product for banks, also for people Who don’t care for decentralisation. That’s ok though.

5512 2018-01-09 17:57:14 hes a pedophile, why else would you need crypto for it
5513 2018-01-09 17:57:06 To you it is. Use #BTC if that's what you prefer. I've done my research, I'll stick with #BitcoinCash
5514 2018-01-09 17:56:50 It’s pretty old in crypto terms
5515 2018-01-09 17:56:42 @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia instead of resisting crypto-ccys why don't we force @HRDMinistry to create an elite applied cryptology programme so that Indian techies can seize the blockchain world they way we did the outsourcing and BPO space? Cryptos are here to stay, don't fight them.
5516 2018-01-09 17:56:39 Read the message again please. Bittrex is supporting the airdrop. Why can’t people stop with panic? Chill, this is crypto, it’s heavily busy at the major exchanges. It will be fine. 
5517 2018-01-09 17:56:33 So much info in the Crypto space 
5518 2018-01-09 17:56:24 100 JPY(BTC): 1259.817 ~ 1263.951 KRW(BTC)
5519 2018-01-09 17:56:24 That's the awesome thing about crypto, it's not an all or nothing game, there are lucrative flavors of coin for everyone. Besides, the safest portfolio is a diverse one.
5520 2018-01-09 17:56:23 These systems are relative is the point. One man is not an island, which is what the entire crypto world seems to think it is due to its anarcho cap tendencies. PS, the eurodollar which brought down the system in 08 was ENTIRELY decentralised
5521 2018-01-09 17:56:22 Welcome back brother!
5522 2018-01-09 17:56:17 They've been going up in price pretty steadily for the last few months and bound to hit 25$ by next month. The returns compared to crypto and seem marginal!
5523 2018-01-09 17:56:12 long $SSC ... crypto play I think is basing nicely, and with $KODK moving, this may get some juice #stocks #daytrade #swingtrade
5524 2018-01-09 17:56:10 So you HODL BTC hoping the value will continue to increase while you say there’s no consumer value in XRP but your position is the same with BTC as there is no real functionality in it and continues to show its weakness as a utility or payment crypto.
5525 2018-01-09 17:56:03 Most crypto stocks are in a healthy retracement with profit taking.  #BuyTheDip on quality.  $AKE is favored.  Others to watch $SX (perfect pullback) $KASH $BLOK
5526 2018-01-09 17:56:02 Van welke crypto is dat het adres?
5527 2018-01-09 17:56:00 Why would he spend crypto when hes bet his cock that its value will increase 50 times?
5528 2018-01-09 17:55:47 Hey guy's are you in crypto?
5529 2018-01-09 17:55:41 This along with the Dimon news today really makes me  at those calling crypto a bubble last year.

5536 2018-01-09 17:55:25 Don’t you think mass adoption is impossible without an public ledger option like #Verge? Or is DeepOnion rather a product then a currency? I mean; when buying from merchants you need to be able to see the transactions publicly in case of refunds or whatsoever.

I.e. taxation to prevent the market from saturation. Anyone on the FOMO hype train doesn’t understand the goal of Crypto. Not a get rich method.

5605 2018-01-09 17:49:05 "The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO's you have to look at individually". Yes, yes... Come to the darkside, James Dimon. @jpmorgan #bitcoin
5606 2018-01-09 17:49:00 No. Just punctuation in my tweet. All $DRGN bags are pumping today.
5607 2018-01-09 17:48:51 It's kinda funny but... now you've just brought another negative spotlight onto crypto
5608 2018-01-09 17:48:50 確かにそうツイートしてる人は沢山いますね。

良ければ、"売られた"っていうソースを貼っていただけませんか???
5609 2018-01-09 17:48:50 Charlie Lee started a "Conscious Crypto" trend

Blindly chasing crypto profits has caused lots of environmental & social damage. We need a new incentive system & I think altruism is it.

I urge @VitalikButerin, @bgarlinghouse & @zooko to follow his lead by dumping all your coins.
5610 2018-01-09 17:48:45 Crypto is basically office work, so it will be a very natural transition for you. 
5611 2018-01-09 17:48:42 ok why even using crypto when even the banks are faster. They didnt understand and not ready
5612 2018-01-09 17:48:22 Wall Street chasing $kodk.
#crypto is everywhere.
5613 2018-01-09 17:48:20 #TRX $TRX Come buyers get in now!!! #whales will be buying!!! #crytocurrency #cryptonews #altcoinnews #altcoinarmy #altcoin @davidgokhshtein @6BillionPeople @crypto_sarah9 @lifewithbastos @PennyStocksMomo @ForbesCrypto @CNBC @business @markets @BigCheds @MarketTradeLive
5614 2018-01-09 17:48:17 Oh yes!
5615 2018-01-09 17:47:57 The crypto market will crash. And that’s fine
5616 2018-01-09 17:47:52 But I get what your saying, easy to set up and promote the coin using that. I’m sure loads of coins are at it  Wild West of crypto 
5617 2018-01-09 17:47:47 I try not to get too excited. I don’t go heavy on many coins just because crypto is a hell of a market, but all emotion aside $btcp will over take all previous “bitcoin’s” eventually in my eyes. Fast. $ETH will always be a beast. But I am 100% in on this one. Long+short.
5618 2018-01-09 17:47:41 Why sorry? Do they have to sell their bags at a certain time?
5619 2018-01-09 17:47:32 There are just so many reasons NOT to watch TV you know.  Like going snowboarding for example, where I'm going right now.  I love to just get out and enjoy life, try new and exciting things, meet new and fun people.  TV just doesn't do it for me.  I like a good movie though. 
5620 2018-01-09 17:47:28 YW brother.
5621 2018-01-09 17:47:27 cryptoanxiety: anxiety derived from thinking of the people around you getting rich off trading crypto while you’re busy being beat to a pulp trying to get by in our fucked capitalist society while living in nyc.
5622 2018-01-09 17:47:23 > kids screaming crypto currency
these are the words of a nocoiner.
5623 2018-01-09 17:47:21 Thanks guys! Will HODL 
5624 2018-01-09 17:47:19 I could cash in & buy a Tesla TODAY straight cash omg I love crypto

5627 2018-01-09 17:46:53 Picked up some of these on the cheap a little while back. Definitely a good project, IMO.
5628 2018-01-09 17:46:48 Wise words there. Thanks 
5629 2018-01-09 17:46:47 Definitely Nik 4 Linx
5630 2018-01-09 17:46:46 This is another level 
5631 2018-01-09 17:46:46 What Mark said.
5632 2018-01-09 17:46:38 If you are thinking of jumping on a Crypto train... the @Ost one is about to leave the platform.
5633 2018-01-09 17:46:30 The next step in "corporation launches crypto" is them realizing there's no reason for it to exist other than "occasionally pays out money" and re-inventing the stock
5634 2018-01-09 17:46:27 やすべぇの、辛い方のつけ麺あるじゃないですか？

5636 2018-01-09 17:46:27 Blowing smoke? Some new age website, claiming 2M yearly users, soliciting writers for articles on finance, wellness, biz, "crypto and cannibas." Payment in crypto currency convertable into dollars on a digital asset exchange. Signed "warm regards."  Mind-blowing!

5638 2018-01-09 17:46:23 Thanks man, will let you know! :)
5639 2018-01-09 17:46:21 To the people investing/buying  crypto. 
If you made profit, would you know how to pay taxes on it?
5640 2018-01-09 17:46:12 Boomers, you can also logon to exchanges and trade crypto. This is hilarious.
5641 2018-01-09 17:46:11 I haven’t seen much consumer use for any crypto as of yet. Sure there are some instances where you could pay a merchant with BTC if they don’t mind waiting an hour for the transaction to complete. I suppose that’s one of the reasons MSFT dropped it.
5642 2018-01-09 17:46:09 Solid project.

5648 2018-01-09 17:45:50 I have bought and sold 20 times, it’s a long term HODL but man I made some serious btc on the bounce
5649 2018-01-09 17:45:50 Bravo. Congrats! Those are some strong hands, Miss.
5650 2018-01-09 17:45:49 @MUMM__RA what do you think of @B3Coins "relaunch"
5651 2018-01-09 17:45:46 J’ai investi dans la crypto monnaie y’a déjà 5 ans et c’est pas pour autant que j’en ai fait une vidéo 
5652 2018-01-09 17:45:46 if he actually really sold a car with crypto then it was bitcoin. i have seen the video and it shows bitcoin not B3. also i am not sure if that would be a sales tax fraud.
5653 2018-01-09 17:45:37 We're sorry for the frustration. For banking concerns please reach out to @SimpliiFin for further assistance. ^AM
5654 2018-01-09 17:45:37 Also decide before you buy whether you see long term value or just short term gains. It makes it easier to ride out the red times, if you’ve already decided it’s a long term hodl :)
5655 2018-01-09 17:45:33 Also crypto cable news = buy XRP tho
5656 2018-01-09 17:45:27 わぁ\(˙꒳˙ )/♡ありがとうございます
5657 2018-01-09 17:45:24 good stuff joey I thought you started believing you knew about crypto lol
5658 2018-01-09 17:45:19 Hello. This is the crypto audit committee. Just checking in to see if you honoured your previous giveaway of 1BTC to anyone that made a meme about McAfee. Kind regards, Crypto audit committee 4LOD.
5659 2018-01-09 17:45:17 Right but literally just started this crypto life 3 weeks ago lol Did a lot of research and finally committed.
5660 2018-01-09 17:45:15 Would you trust a crypto currency backed by a central bank? Fiat currencies $€¥£ etc. have lost 97% of their value over last 100 yrs. Buy Bitcoin #BTC, the bank in your pocket. Store and transfer your money without a bank.
5661 2018-01-09 17:45:14 If you bought $EBST when I called the fork, you could have 6-7 times profit now!! 
#eboost #Crypto #EasyMoney $BTC
5662 2018-01-09 17:45:10 I would say milestone 1 achieved. Raiden and ChainLink will join the party soon!
5663 2018-01-09 17:45:04 Not to mention; how many countries have had their fiat crash and become utterly useless?

It’s sad but that’s why Crypto is changing the world!
5664 2018-01-09 17:45:02 "I do very well when it comes to crypto"

5671 2018-01-09 17:44:36 I dont get all the love for $XRP. By the time financial institutions are desperate enough to adopt something like $XRP, they will already be dead. #Crypto
5672 2018-01-09 17:44:31 I think Mr McAfee should open his own bank for all the crypto currency users, and make it very appealing for business  owners to trade with smaller fees than other banks @officialmcafee
5673 2018-01-09 17:44:19 When video sir?
5674 2018-01-09 17:44:17 Twisted my arm.  I just finished Godless so I will catch up on it.

5679 2018-01-09 17:43:43 Hey. I know you're down right now & I get it but don't let it define you. You have a lot of people who really believe in what you can do & that says something. I guess what I'm saying is... I'm still on your side. I always will be. - Me to #TRX #crypto

5703 2018-01-09 17:41:21 What if AI created its own crypto lures bots across world to mine its tokens. Will it b a separate digital country with bots as citizens and that crypto as currency? If AI could control that digital economy enforcing its own rules, then humans may need "passport" to access them?

5705 2018-01-09 17:41:11 While giving attention to other Crypto’s U might even consider giving @XSPEC_Official an official thank you, using their wallet/code.
5706 2018-01-09 17:41:08 @Michaelhudsonnn should of done this rather than crypto
5707 2018-01-09 17:40:57 Looks like a couple of sell walls that need to be eaten/taken down before $MANA can break over the 2000 sats mark. It will get there though, demand for this coin will only increase as the VR platform realises its vision.
5708 2018-01-09 17:40:40 C'mon, James Altucher?! 
Talk to some real crypto people about Bitcoin, not a guy stuck behind pay walls, sales funnels, and get rich quick sales.

5710 2018-01-09 17:40:33 Pleased to announce the launch of my new cryptocurrency, QCoin. Here’s how it works: you give me your money (the “currency”), and I’ll hide it (that’s the “crypto” part)
5711 2018-01-09 17:40:24 Yeah I got in the game late on those two. That's why. I know it'll bounce back. I'm new in crypto but not to investing. No weak hands here, but definitely hurts watching it go,down so drastically so quickly.

What makes you think this is currently a good buy?
5754 2018-01-09 17:37:44 I think you're onto something here. It may take a few months to learn, but crypto sure  knows how to sort out the weak hands! 
5755 2018-01-09 17:37:39 That's what m saying boss. The way ur arguing or the line of argument can be used by literally anyone to justify illegal trx just because 2 KYC compliant ac did that. It's not legal and not even advisable. Get the law amended. Recognize crypto. Do it. Till then it's illegal.

5760 2018-01-09 17:37:34 Another reason to invest in $SNOV @snovio_ico - they are well aware of the power of social media influence.  This coin WILL blow up BIG TIME.  Don't be the one on the sidelines, we only goin up from here.  #SNOV #snovio #HODL
5761 2018-01-09 17:37:28 1. $BCash isn't #bitcoin  

2. Years in crypto are weeks, you must be new.

3. Why is it always you posting the same spam on $BTC posts, would you like it if people kept spamming your posts telling you that BCash was the real bitcoin despite nobody conventionally believing it?
5762 2018-01-09 17:37:25 My faith has grown so strong in crypto Twitter, today I bought some $TWTR stock! @Twitter When lambo? 
5763 2018-01-09 17:37:24 @Louu97 kijk dat is altijd fijn om te horen. IK woon wel op een mooi caribisch eiland maar ik werk (nog) 40 uur p/w en crypto kost mij ook 40 a 50 uur p/w. Ik probeer alles te callen en te beantwoorden maar een extra kanaal op bv discord of telegram wordt te veel vrees ik. THNX
5764 2018-01-09 17:37:16 Oh no Mr, don't go making excuses now

5773 2018-01-09 17:36:51 Yeah but you need a place to trade your FIAT for crypto.
5774 2018-01-09 17:36:45 Start-ups will have to raise funds in crypto as time goes on

5782 2018-01-09 17:36:19 Yeah thinking is something most crypto traders dont do too much and that's what costs them

5785 2018-01-09 17:35:59 Thank you to an anonymous contributor to the Michael Trimm Show for donating $1 worth of XNN back in November. That $1 crypto contribution is now worth over $460. THANK YOU!
5786 2018-01-09 17:35:57 Im not calling Ripple inc.'s consensus ledger a scam. There are plenty of banks testing this technology today. XRP is another story. But they are centralised end off and that defeats the crypto that’s why ripple trying to change. When they have,ripple  that’s my point of view
5787 2018-01-09 17:35:47 Aha just none crypto office work :(
5788 2018-01-09 17:35:46 I've stated several times, in order to avoid confusion, that I have an ear very close to the ground, and I get information to share by one of the marketers from time to time - but the only official handle for announcements straight from the source is vergecurrency
5789 2018-01-09 17:35:43 To be fair to Jamie as the CEO of J P Morgan I can imagine the FED would have taken a dim view of him coming out and telling the world FIAT is dead, long live crypto.  Maybe now the FED have softened their stance...they cant afford to be left behind and just realised that!
5790 2018-01-09 17:35:38 How are you going to call and try to recruit me to your company and your #1 selling point is that your stock jumped 12% overnight? That’s some crypto currency-esque volatility right there. 
5791 2018-01-09 17:35:34 It's raining #crypto !!

5794 2018-01-09 17:35:26 @elonmusk your renewable energy solutions really need to make their way into the cryptocurrency space. 

Solar powered mining just seems right. : )
5795 2018-01-09 17:35:18 just participated in the @axpire_official ICO. pretty excited #ico #crypto #axpire
5796 2018-01-09 17:35:13 I think I saw something on Twitter about it just a day or two ago, but maybe it was back during Christmas.
5797 2018-01-09 17:35:11 In $LBCC. Tight stop loss. Has bitcoin news #crypto
5798 2018-01-09 17:34:58 We shouldn't give IMF style banking the time of day with crypto. These people will only governance & centralize it like they probably did to bitcoin.
5799 2018-01-09 17:34:49 You're right. It defentiley helps clear the mind.  Just happy to be able work out while still learning about crypto now. I'm sure Knicks fans will be happy too. I tend to slow down post all star break so I need all the workouts I can get it.
5800 2018-01-09 17:34:47 Is this a real thing shit I'll sell my poloniex account
5801 2018-01-09 17:34:43 Honestly next week after the announcement if trx goes high finds a support at .20. That’s enough. I will be golden.
5802 2018-01-09 17:34:35 that's what i say myself everytime and fail everytime cause crypto : )
5803 2018-01-09 17:34:29 That's it bhau. Whether to have crypto or not is a full separate discussion
5804 2018-01-09 17:34:28 It feels so amazing! It's so wonderfully freeing.  I went full-time about a month ago. :)   What kind of work do you do?
5805 2018-01-09 17:34:25 They should announce a crypto currency
5806 2018-01-09 17:34:21 oh yes
5807 2018-01-09 17:34:13 @BKBrianKelly what do you think of SBI Holdings, SBHGF large crypto company, 10.5% stake in ripple
5808 2018-01-09 17:34:12 Just before Xmas? Yes I'm not sure if it has since
5809 2018-01-09 17:34:06 When moon sir?
5810 2018-01-09 17:34:05 Haha well I have publically made my distain for crypto kitties clear. Would be a hypocrite to suddenly support hash puppies 

Plus you got the reach to auction of anything you breed live on youtube 
5811 2018-01-09 17:34:02 @crypto_port are you planning to integrate (Un)realized gains/losses? I like this app a lot btw. Good job
5812 2018-01-09 17:33:59 US dollar has been used for this at a level that crypto could only hope to obtain...this is such a dumb debate, argument, or whatever you want to call it. USD has been used for more shady shit than any other currency.
5813 2018-01-09 17:33:46 Anticipating #XRP price to spike up with the #WesternUnion and #TransferWise partnership with ripple. Also launch of crypto-exchange by DMM supporting #XRP on its website with over 25 million users per month will fuel the price by end of the week.

5824 2018-01-09 17:32:41 lol -  wouldn't describe ripple (the coin/token) as crypto at all.
but bitcoin STILL thinks Jamie Dimon is a Fraud, just saying.

5832 2018-01-09 17:31:58 Crypto-currency is just digital financing that can be tracked by revenue agents for business purposes. It is the same as regular banking, in the sense that officers can inspect the system. Regulation is inherent in banking transactions.
5833 2018-01-09 17:31:52 It's an old coin, got new life, new devs. Website launch on the 15th, whitepaper on the 1st of february. Talks with new exchanges.

5839 2018-01-09 17:31:21 i wanna follow a lot of this stuff, but far too much junk food. i dont care what natalie portman had for lunch unless she's paying in crypto.
5840 2018-01-09 17:31:17 Only crypto I got faith in for the long run is ripple cuz it's controlled by banks and real companies using it.
5841 2018-01-09 17:31:06 Your CEO is a goon. Crypto will not be controlled by a government. Such a power hungry and ego driven government look at it in action. "WE WANT TO CONTROL EVERYTHING" is the translation. @jpmorgan

5883 2018-01-09 17:28:28 What the govt can do is designate crypto as a high risk product. In Switzerland for example the minimum investment in  Hedge fund used to be regulated at usd100k. That automatically eliminated any poor/ financially illiterate person from doing something they don't understand.

5887 2018-01-09 17:28:10 PSA for those in Canada trading crypto currencies: 
Report your 2017 trades on your 2017 tax return, and your 2018 trades on your 2018 return.  Not in whatever year you pulled out the cash.  That's wrong, and CRA can smack you with really harsh penalties.

5898 2018-01-09 17:27:10 Hahahahaha. Yeah.
5899 2018-01-09 17:27:05 Again I will have to disagree.  Fiat will implode under it's own self destructive weight, system was designed to fail.  Crypto will be still standing strong in the dust cloud that was once a fiat system.
5900 2018-01-09 17:27:04 Hahah! COOOOL XD gg man!
5901 2018-01-09 17:27:02 If you're currently thinking about using Coinbase to get some crypto, don't. They like to keep you funds frozen for 72 hours without allowing you to access them. Their support replies the same snippet after a day over and over. Save yourself the headache.
5902 2018-01-09 17:27:00 Let me ask you this, what are the *most* important aspects of a decentralized crypto currency/asset? I'll give you a hint, it isn't transaction speed.
5903 2018-01-09 17:26:57 Better than crypto in your opinion?
5904 2018-01-09 17:26:54 Waiting. Patiently 
5905 2018-01-09 17:26:42 jajajaj di que si... viva la diversificación!! Yo suelo tener entre 25 y 30
5906 2018-01-09 17:26:41 Paid?
5907 2018-01-09 17:26:40 Nah...it might pop (like everything right now), but in this ludacris world where 95% of valuation is driven by bright colors on the website, I'll stick with the immediate gains while the gettin's good bc this shit is not going to last much longer
5908 2018-01-09 17:26:39 Israel just said crypto currency hard to regulate and planing to ban crypto companies. Trump is a friend of Isreal... so most likely he will impose regulation on it... don’t you agree?
5909 2018-01-09 17:26:33 There is a crypto LinkedIn? Who knew?

5912 2018-01-09 17:26:17 Now people are just wanting  crypto currency
5913 2018-01-09 17:26:16 I'm holding out for a crypto that helps me monetize my tweeting in a secure blockchain democratic platform. STORMcoin!
5914 2018-01-09 17:26:14 100 JPY(BTC): 1260.389 ~ 1261.405 KRW(BTC)
5915 2018-01-09 17:26:09 Registration ? If we hold the coins in our wallet wouldn’t we get an air drop automatically?
5916 2018-01-09 17:26:06 If you invested $15,000,000 in $XVG today... You would have $1000 less than a year from now. 
5917 2018-01-09 17:26:05 I think many people in crypto are short sighted and want gains this week, not in 6 months. Just shows that market is immature, and what qash and quione are building is a product designed for a more mature and legitimate market.
5918 2018-01-09 17:26:04 haha, its tough. exciting and stressful. i keep saying oh in 6 months thisll be amazing, gotta keep telling myself to live in the moment more :)

5925 2018-01-09 17:25:31 I agree with @jessepollak, working at @coinbase must feel like working at a young company bringing internet to the mainstream.

Coinbase is the AOL of crypto.

5938 2018-01-09 17:24:57 Guys. Calm down. Read my original tweet. I said "crypto for all its benefits" I do understand its the future and block chain etc. Pls do not digress. I was discussing about the extant law as of now.
5939 2018-01-09 17:24:46 Supply dynamics are just one of many variables to analyze in a crypto. Different cryptos are better suited for different goals.

5942 2018-01-09 17:24:31 Speculative Analysis & Investments
5943 2018-01-09 17:24:28 Transaction speed in crypto is cheap and easy and should not be valued as highly as decentralization and censorship resistance. $xrp $nem $btc
5944 2018-01-09 17:24:27 Is a bubble!!!
5945 2018-01-09 17:24:24 In share market u will invest in a company(which has few products to sell). Where as crypto currency apart from the demand there is nothing. Today Bitcoin is leading because people are crazy about that but tomorrow it’s another coin. It’s more of a gambling than an investment
5946 2018-01-09 17:24:22 Mine was $2000 and I can’t afford insurance either

5953 2018-01-09 17:24:09 Things are going well for $XVG. Very exciting to see this success unfold. Proud to have invested and dedicated so much time to #Verge. However, like me, I am sure most of you are invested in more than one coin. if you're on @Cryptopia_NZ @hitbtc or @etherdelta take a look at $PLR
5954 2018-01-09 17:23:55 Ether Delta is not an easy crypto exchange for the average user to use. Once #kin hits more exchanges prepare for lift off.
5955 2018-01-09 17:23:51 Someone has to speak towards the massive amounts of absolute bullshit being thrown around in the crypto world. I think your opinions are spot on and I wouldnt change anything you do Pierre! Ripple shouldn't even be classified as a crypto. Bitcoin 4 life!

5970 2018-01-09 17:23:08 :-) anything value around 50c is worth investing about 100 shares in crypto .. cause you have nothing to lose and you have every chance to become millionaire in 1-2 years.

5980 2018-01-09 17:22:08 What about extension socks?
5981 2018-01-09 17:22:08 Or, it continues this oh-so-confusing-to-the-crypto-space sideways action seen by most other legit assets traded in places like CME. If it is, there will still be an up or down trend; but we'll have to zoom out to weekly candles to see it.

Sir, I found your training very valuable about crypto currency. It was so simple way to learn about crypto currency & I say this, that I never seen such a good trainer. Within a very short period of time, I learned a lot &  I recommend others to get the same training.

6007 2018-01-09 17:20:23 I can think crypto is a bubble and a ponzi schene and also think that banks are scamming us by holding funds like that. The two are not mutually exclusive.

6013 2018-01-09 17:20:05 To be honest I find it incredible that it's valued at even 15% of BTC. I'm genuinely surprised at the lack of patience of people, but I guess 15% could be considered outliers. Have a good day anyway. I hope we all win.

6015 2018-01-09 17:19:55 Great analogy! But it's not just a competition to survive. Most species depend on other species of might even form a symbiosis. It's the same thing with crypto and it's something to keep in mind when investing of course!

6053 2018-01-09 17:17:45 Lets fock the $XVG haters now. Prepare for huuuuge ride. Still time to load bags and make a 7000% profit trip
6054 2018-01-09 17:17:40 I was on Verge too. But after the failed release of Wraith Protocol I sold it all.. But I was on at 0.01$ so made profit with Verge anyways
6055 2018-01-09 17:17:40 @hitbtc Hello Team, 
Is it okay to withdraw LTC? Will I face any delays in LTC transactions during the maintanence or in general or is this only for ETH withdrawals?
6056 2018-01-09 17:17:31 Lol
6057 2018-01-09 17:17:27 No joke every single company should issue crypto at this point, it's unbelievable.   #kodacoin
6058 2018-01-09 17:17:24 $POE .00002300 SATS
$XVG will continue its pump-n- dump, peaking at .00001785 SATS
$TRX will continue to drop to .08c USD
$XLM to .80c within approx 2 weeks
6059 2018-01-09 17:17:16 Waiting since June last year... I hope people cancel their selling orders and we can speed things up. If not... patience.

6063 2018-01-09 17:16:53 $400 no chance - $5 - $8 would be incredible achievement in 2018 ($5 = $75 billion Market Cap)

6066 2018-01-09 17:16:49 Man to buy crypto sucked  . Coinbase  seems a long way off getting even the basics right. Growth pains are one thing but outright incompetency is a biggy,.  jmho

6075 2018-01-09 17:16:28 Much like the video mishap in yesterday’s VR session, the crypto guys can’t get their microphones to work.
6076 2018-01-09 17:16:25 you should buy this, hold and stake for prologned period of time. This is a long term play. 37% is nothing in the grand scheme of things.
6077 2018-01-09 17:16:24 Verge is definitely heading somewhere. You need to check the latest price.
6078 2018-01-09 17:16:23 That's because they dont know how to read charts dont take the time to figure it out, and dont know the actual service for the coins. Lazy and ignorant investors lol

6084 2018-01-09 17:16:13 Gold was ruthlessly suppressed during the inflate phase of QE. Paper assets, and etheric assets (crypto) allowed to soar. Physical assets (oil,Gold,Silver,) held down via derivatives. Now rates rising no need to ruthlessly suppress price as gradual price discovery is allowed

6088 2018-01-09 17:15:53 The problem with bitcoin and crypto developers is that most of the time they have spent zero time looking into why pre-existing systems are set up the way they are. The answer to that is always down to risk and liquidity pooling in a free-system.
6089 2018-01-09 17:15:53 @howardlindzon maybe Dimon will lead the Facebook crypto 
6090 2018-01-09 17:15:52 Hi @bnarendra86  we need crypto to solve real issue specially in developing countries

6101 2018-01-09 17:15:05 Because your into crypto and your a hot chick 
6102 2018-01-09 17:15:03 Bitcoin made up 87% of the crypto market one year ago. Today, it has fallen to 36%. Competitors to Bitcoin have often proven themselves either easier to use and trade or safer for businesses.

6113 2018-01-09 17:14:28 Yep. On the other hand, if you would have bought 1000usd of a lot of other shit coins, you would have zero today. And it's very hard to justify bag holding when you know they're shit.

6152 2018-01-09 17:11:58 One big mistake people make in #cryptocurrency is not setting up the right exchanges IN ADVANCE to wanting something on that platform.

6172 2018-01-09 17:10:47 The answer is simple. There are only to type of coins. Crypto and Not crypto... So in that light your choice just became more easy!

6175 2018-01-09 17:10:35 it makes sense . a pig is heavier than a dog so should be at least double means at least 4 billion . i should make a dinosaur coin . see crypto is science and high tech

6182 2018-01-09 17:09:35 A friend of mine asked “how do taxes work in crypto?”  I told him 1.) I’m not a CPA and 2.) you are worrying about the wrong thing. You need to focus on buying your first crypto asset $btc $ltc $eth $vtc
6183 2018-01-09 17:09:34 Your exchange sucks ! I want my crypto out of there

6185 2018-01-09 17:09:29 If a project is forcing a token utilization by making you pay for something that's been historically free, that project will either fail or drastically change token use case in the future.

6189 2018-01-09 17:09:19 OH that make sense. Yes I trade on ETH on Binance because BTC is too expensive to send over and takes to long. So i send ETH from bittrex to Binance and it gets there in 30 seconds for pennies. Since they have an ETH pair I just use that.
6190 2018-01-09 17:09:17 twitter ain't the place to be asking this.

6196 2018-01-09 17:09:05 smh use your best judgement.. all these people that think they're "crypto experts" have gotten lucky, or have a lot of followers.  Nobody is an expert in an upredictable market.  Just look for good news and buy that coin.  You give them the title expert when you trust their word.

6227 2018-01-09 17:06:32 The main problem was the marketing since then they have been proactive and are revamping the marketing can’t ask for much more than that give it time xvg will be a huge player in crypto I have no doubt.. of course my opinion!
6228 2018-01-09 17:06:28 It took over 24 hours to get mine too.  They are upgrading their nodes to account for the increased volume of crypto trading.  Even the large exchanges are having issues.
6229 2018-01-09 17:06:27 What's your fascination with this Mr. Robot anyhow?  Perhaps I'll look it up, and watch a bit.  Pretty, nerdy, crypto, what else is there to know?

6234 2018-01-09 17:05:52 Het downloaden van die Jaxx wallet is het meeste werk, eenmaal aangemaakt kun je super simpel betalen en ontvangen met heel veel verschillende crypto’s.

6236 2018-01-09 17:05:41 $LUN is the real silent giant of the crypto world. The Wikipedia of the decentralized world is a must have in your portfolio. Beta launch happening month end should really boost this one up. I predict $80 USD by end of Jan for this gem. #lunyr #cryptocurrency

6238 2018-01-09 17:05:30 #BitcoinCash is superior to #Paypal in almost everyway. Fast transactions, low fees, no lockouts, no middleman, borderless payments, decentralized.

6241 2018-01-09 17:05:14 Rhetoric with no substance. I've read the medium articles previously, which is why I'm asking you to back up your original statement with some form of argument. Which you don't seem to want to do. So why waste mine and your time.
6242 2018-01-09 17:05:11 Do you think it will be >$100 by end of year?

6244 2018-01-09 17:04:45 Gerucht gaat dat bankiers, brokers & investeerders massaal hun bonussen in crypto beleggen as we speak. Hoe gaaf is dat. Van (een) Fiat  naar een Lamborghini .
6245 2018-01-09 17:04:34 I am pretty sure the highest ranked privacy coin at the end of the year will be $BTCP Bitcoin Private. Maybe even the highest ranked coin. The brand is important and "zk-snarks are the most undervalued thing in crypto right now" (Vitalik Buterin)

6252 2018-01-09 17:04:02 Download voor de gein maar zo’n Jaxx wallet. Maak ik je $ 1.00 aan crypto over en kijk je de komende weken of het meer of minder waard wordt. Het werkt super simpel, kan gewoon via Twitter dat overmaken.
6253 2018-01-09 17:04:00 Agree fully. Just as #XRP was about to break into a 5th Elliot wave. The timing was impeccable.
6254 2018-01-09 17:03:56 XPの強みはコミュニティとされるが、あれは数だけ多くて中身は楽観・何もしない・他人任せの人間が大半というのはBinance投票ではっきり見えた。あれだけ数いて、コミュの強さはXRB以下。所詮バラマキで人を集めたコミュ。中身スカスカと思い対象から外した

6285 2018-01-09 17:01:54 Any coin at coin ecxhange is fraud. They create a buzz but you can just buy coins at the time of selling you will not be able to sell as huge backlogs for sellings are already in que set by crypto scammers. Hope this helps.

6294 2018-01-09 17:01:20 Every pattern can break either way. Some patterns just have an increased likelihood in one direction.
In the crypto sphere they mostly break to the top.

6335 2018-01-09 16:57:46 Completely agree. The end game is $BTCP which I believe will be superior to $BTG without a doubt. I would love for it to take the place of $BCH altogether, but that's an uphill battle w/ Roger Ver + clan

6341 2018-01-09 16:57:17 With my understanding of #Crypto today I do not grasp how new currencies are planning on surving without existing online communities  (ready to adopt a new #coin as s utility currency inside a popular app for example). #KIN coin is a great example that will serve the Kik chat app

6372 2018-01-09 16:54:33 Indeed. Thanks Peter. From what we're hearing from our field folks there will indeed be a series of news items about crypto currencies in the very near future. It seems currencies not backed (and regulated) by governments may have problems. Who'd a thunk it?!

6380 2018-01-09 16:54:09 Hold on Serge. If there is anything I have learned in crypto is patience and belief in your convictions from your research. I believe we should hear something by Friday or Monday at the latest.
6381 2018-01-09 16:54:03 Try turning your old GPUs into crypto currency miners. It’s the rainy day fund of the future.

6386 2018-01-09 16:53:44 Everyone and their grandma is buying up all the gpus. Making the price go up and making them unavailable. Fuck crypto currency. I just want to play modern games at a decent frame rate.
6387 2018-01-09 16:53:44 No-one is spreading fear - they see the DNS poison of Ether Delta and it seems like the most common attack vector. If you can make a statement and remove the FUD that would be great I love MEW personally it is very well coded system.

6406 2018-01-09 16:52:15 True. You could try mining smaller Crypto that you think will rise.
6407 2018-01-09 16:52:11 Thank you for the input.  I did buy up early, went back to buy more and accidentally bought double my intention due to a lagging bittrex.
6408 2018-01-09 16:51:57 My crypto use case? Right now I am using it to learn trading in real time markets but would I love it to be a portable way to pay for anything with my phone and a simple click ;-)

6414 2018-01-09 16:51:04 ISO’s give a whole new meaning to trading-pairs 
6415 2018-01-09 16:50:54 Define "far superior". Because from my side all I see is a coin that has zero innovation for scaling. What happens when the blocks are full on bcash? I'm willing to bet you won't answer that question at all.
6416 2018-01-09 16:50:53 Really wish I had been mining crypto while my computers slept instead of S.E.T.I.
6417 2018-01-09 16:50:51 I'm honored. Thank you Jonez!
6418 2018-01-09 16:50:36 Nog leuker is dat sites als bv Twitter je gaan betalen als je op Twitter zit. Uiteraard in crypto-geld.
6419 2018-01-09 16:50:29 
6420 2018-01-09 16:50:29 You think,or you are sure about it. Cuz other guys told me this is correct one. Damn super confused atm
6421 2018-01-09 16:50:23 I hate to pull numbers out of thin air but $300-600 would be a conservative estimate for $ZCL leading up to the fork, imo. $600-$1K would be amazing, but a little too optimistic. Again, just my opinion.
6422 2018-01-09 16:50:21 I.e. Copy = distribute = there is no protection from this. That is not the same as transact = record a transfer of ownership from one account to another on the shared ledger that makes up a crypto.
6423 2018-01-09 16:50:17 Who’s gonna be the first Mc to rap “use to bag boxes now we move crypto!”
6424 2018-01-09 16:50:16 I know, I know, thought the same thing myself. The token price was listed at 51 dollars on their .com site yesterday. Now it's at 13?????? Hey, if I can take anything out at this point, I'm happy. If I get my loan profits for the rest of the month, I'm a happy man.
6425 2018-01-09 16:50:14 Is it just me or did $NEO do this run on really low volume? Only a tad above 3k BTC/24h ... What would we see when verge/ripple -like FOMO money turns to it? #Crypto

6428 2018-01-09 16:50:00 Random thought of the day: #fiat is just another layer of the stack, and may continue to play a role over the long-term in #crypto systems
6429 2018-01-09 16:50:00 How does this impact the composition and focus of startups? Friends and family made you risk averse, not wanting to lose their money. But also made you work hard. With crypto you have more time to focus but less pressure?

- avoid porn and public torrent sites
- use 2FA
- avoid links from ads
- use one mail just for crypto (e.g. protonmail)

6457 2018-01-09 16:47:45 Sometimes a plug for a crypto coin by certain folks is like making decisions based upon a roulette wheel. Occasionally they are right, but generally it is coincidence.

6460 2018-01-09 16:47:41 There are a lot of unknown variables with this, because it's a type of fork that's never been done before. Also, hard to determine what the market will pay for this based on the price that they anticipate $BTCP to be worth.

6474 2018-01-09 16:46:33 U in the crypto game too?
6475 2018-01-09 16:46:18 What's your opinion on #QASH ? Is good to accumulate ? Their "world book" which sounds like global liquidity hub & SOR/OMS bridge fiat <-> crypto, will be huge if delivered. Team's excellent. Looks like annoucements coming for $QASH?
6476 2018-01-09 16:46:06 So, what would be the point of living abroad then to become a crypto trader? You’ll still have to pay these shitty US taxes. Unless you pull a Roger Ver and renounce your citizenship.

No, not every coin has some company behind it. Are you new to the crypto game, Jim? How many exchanges are you familiar with?
6485 2018-01-09 16:45:07 Wow!  Visa/MC currently are processing about 2,000 per second.  They have the capability to do up around 50,000 per second.  Once $DGB can start handling the amount of transactions for mainstream use, lookout!

6490 2018-01-09 16:44:30 Has the price of bitcoin gone up or is the US dollar experiencing hyperinflation? Cryptocurrencies are a true measure of the global value of the dollar. #bitcoin #btc #xbt #crypto #cryptocurrency #dollar #USD #blockchain #finance #business #money
6491 2018-01-09 16:44:25 They are kinda both that same thing
6492 2018-01-09 16:44:23 RT @crypto_Coin_Ar: الأن علمنا كيف تمت أزحة الوسطاء في عمليات الارسال والاستقبال

وأيضا علمنا ماهي نسبة الامان بحيث انه لايستطيع احد التلاعب بسبب عدد المعدنين في نظام #البلوك_تشين

ولكن كيف نقلل خسائر العمولات ؟

6499 2018-01-09 16:44:02 I increasingly think the notion of BTC and Crypto as being an uncorrelated asset class is largely a myth. Insanely cheap Fiat pretty much pushes everything higher.

6509 2018-01-09 16:43:33 Everyone saying $TRX is crap, just remember that Justin Sun (founder) has connections to Wang Jainlin (Dalian Wanda) and Jack Ma (Alibaba), plus he use to work for Ripple in China.

Tron will be fine in the long run, regardless of whatever crypto hack tweet out (myself included)

6625 2018-01-09 16:36:12 Ripple has a plan to make things better. Yes XRP will be much better once the ripple escrow is sold. Bitcoin would be better if they could get the lighting network secure but it's the same idea as 5 years ago. No other crypto can provide the speed and security XRP can for banks.

6635 2018-01-09 16:35:36 I am JavaScript developer who has worked with all major front end frameworks and libraries. I have also worked with node.js. I want to work on full stack crypto and Blockchain based projects. How can I get into that?

6637 2018-01-09 16:35:35 Ripple est très médiatisé pour une crypto qui n’est pas totalement ou suffisamment décentralisée.
6638 2018-01-09 16:35:30 Dit was vorige week nog geen € 40,-. Wereldwijd heel simpel en snel over te maken zonder dat je @ingnl nodig hebt. Over 2-3-4 jaar weet je niet beter en betaal je overal met crypto-geld, gewoon met je smartfoon. ZEC overmaken kost nog geen € 0,04 en het bedrag maakt niet uit.
6639 2018-01-09 16:35:30 Crypto hour starts at 2!
6640 2018-01-09 16:35:26 #Tierion @Tierion is also an Audit Tool Crypto, also undervalued! Any idea it existed? :-)

6645 2018-01-09 16:34:55 That was Crypto is for.  To replace crony capitalism with free market capitalism.

6647 2018-01-09 16:34:54 What is worse is that "Professional Finance/Day Trader friend/family member" that hated on it when you invest, comes back around to sell everyone on his "can't lose crypto investment fund" to get others to invest with them. #brokerjoker

6650 2018-01-09 16:34:36 I wonder whether he is aware... I mean, #crypto Twitter and its nature would be like a paradise for him, really. Judging by some tweets.
6651 2018-01-09 16:34:34 This is one of the reasons why Cryptocurrency gets a bad name.  Until there are ways developed to for the masses to become educated on securely holding their coins, it will always be one of the major barriers to getting Crypto into the mainstream.
6652 2018-01-09 16:34:28 and? I dunno how is he related to the crypto world?

6661 2018-01-09 16:33:42 Banks LOVE Crypto, but they HATE that they will have to make the smart crypto investors rich for them to enter the market.
6662 2018-01-09 16:33:42 agreed; but we lose it all if people see you & others listed as “who to follow on twitter”, then see you bashing projects & they swear off crypto, before they even get started... it’s the same thing that folks did to bitcoin... God needs the Devil, Coke needs Pepsi, BTC needs XRP

6665 2018-01-09 16:33:34 Good, you made a decision and it worked out *for you*. Many won't be seeing the same results, whether it's now or later.

All in all, this is just boasting over who made more profits within a specific context of time, which means nothing in the grand scheme of crypto.

- 2FA EVERYTHING!
- never trade on public wi-fi
- don't click on random stupid links on emails (instead send'em to @rescambot )
and you'll never, never 
- google for an exchange website and click on the fake phishing ads.

No, lots of new coins and tokens have the potential to add value to the ecosystem. 
There's real danger of the opportunists & grifters coming in rewriting for the public the crypto principles of secure, decentralized, anonymous tran.

6727 2018-01-09 16:29:23 The gov't shut down hashcash and Digicash as soon as those projects tried to get off the ground. If they haven't shut down crypto yet, it's because they can't.
6728 2018-01-09 16:29:23 PAC coin will get a LOT of new people not just into crypto, but into trading altcoins right away. It could really help the market. So people, give PAC some love. And buy some while you're at it? RT!

6733 2018-01-09 16:29:05 Everyone can help. 

Remember to contact your current crypto exchange and ask them to please implement #Segwit. 

This is going to be a big year for #Bitcoin. Keep collecting those alt profitz but prepare for the inevitable $BTC bullrun.

6744 2018-01-09 16:28:19 Yeah my thoughts too, though there is one that now has the backing of banks in China/Japan, but because of that no one who likes crypto wants to back it
6745 2018-01-09 16:28:16 I m not against crypto how ever your banking system seems terrible. In Turkey it takes only 10 minutes.

6753 2018-01-09 16:27:45 The problem with today’s banks is there are too many middlemen when it comes to sending money to one another across the world. With Ripple, there is only one, Ripple Labs themselves!
6754 2018-01-09 16:27:43 All those exchanges should fix their user registration issues asap! Their is alot of money waiting to be invested! #crypto #cryptocurrency #btc #eth #bitcoin #ethereum
6755 2018-01-09 16:27:36 The reason it seems that there are 'so many' is because they all do something different. Understand that and you'll understand why crypto is the future; not just a fad or craze.
6756 2018-01-09 16:27:26 Upcoming weeks
6757 2018-01-09 16:27:23 Tron #TRX is what i am invested in for most part. Further i would suggest #POE and #ADA. #IOTA also, but it is not a penny any more. around 3-4 dollars. Same with #SUB I think its still worth it but its a longer hold. Thanks for contacting me! :) Go for a project you believe in!
6758 2018-01-09 16:27:23 You guys should sell every coin you OWN Because eventually you will be handing all your money to smart guys, like me, Who buys when you are fearful. Do yourself a favor and stop while you are ahead

6765 2018-01-09 16:27:11 I agree. I think there's a lot of money to be made by the exchange. However, these two aren't known for listing older small caps like $ZCL within their roster. I personally don't think they'll list a coin just for a fork and then die with no volume.

6771 2018-01-09 16:26:44 @crypto_bobby Love your podcast. Dig the idea of reading a white paper/day. I'm inspired to do the same. Will you let us know which coin you'd be doing each time so I could read up and listen to your thoughts on the whitepaper having already read it myself? Would be awesome.

6773 2018-01-09 16:26:40 Your theory is true if and only if XRP speculators learn something from the pump and dump process, otherwise they just go back to fiat and swear off crypto as a whole.
6774 2018-01-09 16:26:37 Clout & Crypto we not even using real money in 2018 lol
6775 2018-01-09 16:26:35 These are great stories, I love it.  The utmost congrats to you for believing in yourself and not giving up.  Says a lot about you man! Took me 36yrs to believe in me enough to do things without a boss. Started a business and started trading. I'm happier and wealthier than I was
6776 2018-01-09 16:26:32 Everyone is born equal, Looks doesn't matter, Money doesn't mean everything.

Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
6777 2018-01-09 16:26:31 This is crypto bro. No one has to do anything.
6778 2018-01-09 16:26:28 16 currencies altogether (actually 4 of them are fiat and 12 crypto)
6779 2018-01-09 16:26:24 Yep yep $STRAT
6780 2018-01-09 16:26:22 Damn. Would have been nice to start in this crypto game. #sidelined
6781 2018-01-09 16:26:22 (Also, I’m extraordinarily happy that the IDK persisting across boots is on purpose. Hint: an HGS server only does one important crypto operation, and now I can precompute it.)

6791 2018-01-09 16:25:45 Dude! I love xcom and I love crypto currencies! Was happy to see this text. I disagree though. Ethereum is great but Bitcoin has the true promise of crypto currency.
6792 2018-01-09 16:25:37 @LightCrypto I saw you added my profile to some lists about crypto. Interesting: I don't know if I have very much to offer up, but thanks!
6793 2018-01-09 16:25:31 Who? McAffee? Why? I wasn't being facetious. You know I am an escort myself, right? All of the other escorts I know are also big on crypto (we are in an unregulated, all cash business, after all).

I have been advocating for greater crypto adoption in our industry for years.

6801 2018-01-09 16:24:48 Three bits of advice for new crypto investors. 
1. Hodl
2. If a coin sounds too good to be true, you're probably getting ripped off.
3. Don't drink the Kool-aid of assorted coin cults. Do your own research on a coin before you buy. Knowledge is your strongest investment tool.

6804 2018-01-09 16:24:40 Makes NO sense at all to sell #XRP right now knowing that the japanese exchange is opening in  2 days. #buythedip  and make $$ when it hits ! #ripple #xrpthestandard #Crypto

6806 2018-01-09 16:24:32 What if the governments entire motivation behind net neutrality was to  attempt to shut down Crypto? I mean it’s only a 370 billion dollar market they currently can not control.

6811 2018-01-09 16:23:55 Oh yeah? Well, that’s what my local milk bottler told me about his investment strategy back in ‘96. Backtested for prior 2 years, he said. Strong and solid he said.

6812 2018-01-09 16:23:54 True story:

6818 2018-01-09 16:23:43 Current picks: 
$VOISE - Decentralized Itunes/Spotify
$UFR - Upfiring - Crypto + torrenting
$LEND - SALT competitor, just partnered with...
$ENG - Enigma, private smart contracts, MIT team
$FLIXX, $VIU - longshots for decentralized Youtube
$IOTA - awaiting news of "Q" DAG
6819 2018-01-09 16:23:42 Nice! I'm so out of touch with newer music. That's probably my issue with this year's lineup. Have probably spent a year and a half just listening to The Mountain Goats.
6820 2018-01-09 16:23:40 Don’t die beakie.
6821 2018-01-09 16:23:40 Mooi om te zien dat het successen oplevert! En ook mooi om zelf beetje met crypto’s te spelen dus volg je graag.
6822 2018-01-09 16:23:36 If you're here I have a feeling your bags are solid.  I'm mainly talking about the non-minable, centralized projects masquerading as legit crypto. Don't want to name names, but basically ripple needs to die.
6823 2018-01-09 16:23:35 Just discovered “The Bad Crypto Podcast “

6824 2018-01-09 16:23:30 Money, it's all about money. If I have a couple million dollars sitting in my bank account, I wouldn't be this hesitant.
6825 2018-01-09 16:23:21 If you're looking for coins that are normally in the $10-$15 range but are are on sale, check out $ICX and $WTC, as in read and DYOR.  Some of my fav picks now #Crypto

6827 2018-01-09 16:23:12 If this continues, may be a bit tricky to tackle. Especially if there are such (potential) 'issues' like crypto wallets and stuffs (from government perspective...).

6852 2018-01-09 16:21:18 This is amazing  Maybe someone should create a crypto tax where people contribute voluntarily and pooled funds get delivered to communities that need the most help? Projects can be verified via us on the blockchainwhat do u think?

6860 2018-01-09 16:20:37 I'm a fan of Substratum, but Ethereum is a building cryptocurrency that others will build other crypto solution on top of, with huge potential. They're not directly comparable. But of course there is much space left for the SUB token to go up, as the solution itself gears up.

6881 2018-01-09 16:19:19 BCH doesn’t have low fees. If it becomes even remotely widely used, either fees will go up or the network centralizes with larger and larger blocks (it’s pretty centralized already).

6889 2018-01-09 16:18:55 your podcast is dope, but i think what you may be failing to see is that you indirectly hurt #bitcoin by attacking other projects... regardless of your views on the project, fiat converted to any crypto helps #btc; every dollar bet on #XRP #Ripple, is an indirect vote for bitcoin
6890 2018-01-09 16:18:48 Wow! @NucleusVision is bridging the gaps between offline retailers and Customers... So cool!
6891 2018-01-09 16:18:47 *bangs head on desk* no, it is not centralised. Well, at least not in the sense that the network is a decentralised way to transfer value across the planet. Not decentralised, in a most-of-it-owned-and-controlled-by-chinese-mining-cabals, way.
6892 2018-01-09 16:18:47 Great product that I believe has real practical use cases. It would be awesome to get @procurrency_  in gas stations and supermarkets so we don’t have to carry around a “loyalty” card for every single store. Great way to introduce people to crypto in the everyday life.

 Rule 3 : Do Not Panic Sells/Buys
 Rule 4 : Do Not Be Greedy
 Rule 5 : Buy At Rumours ,Sell at News.

There's a difference between professional and endangering the people who trust you. This is the latter, not the former.
6910 2018-01-09 16:17:26 Question for #mobile #app #developers and my #adtech peeps: How will the evolution of #crypto / #blockchain based #programmatic #ads benefit publishers and developers and/or shift monetization opportunities? Your best replies may end up as a quote in an article I am writing. Thx!
6911 2018-01-09 16:17:23 So I bought more and kinda forgot about it haha
6912 2018-01-09 16:17:21 Are you sure... I’m not around my computer to double check. But I’m pretty sure it is.. if not Sorry!!! JUST BUY DAMMIT!! LOL

6914 2018-01-09 16:17:07 Your ICO / CRYPTO checklist! How to spot good investments?
6915 2018-01-09 16:17:07 Yup, but it was trading at ico price also for a little bit
6916 2018-01-09 16:17:01 Crypto bubble accentuating how many good deals there are in small caps. Companies that will never, ever see profitability/you'll never use their products are flying to 1B valuation for no reason while quietly are great deals on real exchanges. Value comes back into focus soon IMO
6917 2018-01-09 16:17:00 My opinion...crypto is a simple race right now, dig up as many coins as you can in as short a time as possible. We are still in an unknown industry . How long before the feds officially figure out how to get their piece . That day they get officially  involved  it crashes. ..
6918 2018-01-09 16:16:56 Man, I alway DYOR and I stopped following @crypto_rand's call since long ago. But I keep learning from his T.A. style. 
I was just asking myself this funny question if by giving his point of view he can cause a bias, thus making a self realising prediction. Chill :')

6920 2018-01-09 16:16:49 Ppl should pay me to manage their crypto portfolios for them and make them money. I gamble with my own but with theirs i would make more safe longer term investments. Win-win for both of us. You gone fuck it off anyway.

But if they ban crypto in between where should i go.

6932 2018-01-09 16:15:59 The date of the snapshot hasn't been announced yet. Expect $ZCL to pump sharply when it's officially announced and confirmed. My guess is that when that happens, Binance or  KuCoin will then make preparations for the $BTCP airdrop. If they'll list $ZCL is questionable though 
6933 2018-01-09 16:15:58 Goddamn right. <3 them both. Gogol Bordello was great, too, but I like some eclectic shit.

6937 2018-01-09 16:15:41 $KIN will get there, it’s application is second to none. This is genuinely the first and only crypto I’ve backed due to the potential of the token, and I’m proud to be backing what I believe will be the next big thing.

Once we’re on a better blockchain, the exchanges will come

6946 2018-01-09 16:14:50 They were being accused of hoarding peoples bcash coins as they were originally not supporting the fork. If you had your bitcoin in say a ledger, then you would of received the same amount in bcash, this was not the case for bitcoin hodlers on coinbase. Their hands were tied.
6947 2018-01-09 16:14:46 The problem isn't telling the truth, it's that crypto has this stigma that is stopping great numbers of people from getting involved. You say you're trying to help crypto. Saying things like that doesn't help.
6948 2018-01-09 16:14:46 Cant expect anymore from #xrb my advice stay out of the small exchanges. Sorry to all that lost out, i've been there its shit but stay positive there is always an upside around the corner in crypto!
6949 2018-01-09 16:14:36 @krakenfx We're doing a funny "mean crypto tweets" video and suspect that you've received a fair amount - plus whoever was running your Twitter account last summer obviously has a sense of humor. We'd love it if you could participate!

6962 2018-01-09 16:13:53 Agreed. This is impossible to do. And I love that about #crypto.
6963 2018-01-09 16:13:50 Outsourcing, blockchain style..
6964 2018-01-09 16:13:48 Not too late?
6965 2018-01-09 16:13:46 agreed. I didn't invest much. XRP was my first alt coin I bought. I bought XLM and XRP. I love crypto, but love it as a hobby. Not really living or dying off of it.
6966 2018-01-09 16:13:41 Bettet sell ur PAC coin ,because this coin no worth right now if they do that.
6967 2018-01-09 16:13:31 Did $POE JUST 25X?! That is the only way for it to be more expensive than $TRX right now. POE is dirt cheap compared to TRX. Or maybe market caps don’t matter anymore in crypto.
6968 2018-01-09 16:13:26 Got me a bag on the 20 EMA retest, one of the few TREX coins that didn't blow up yet.
6969 2018-01-09 16:13:24 Scam how? Ripple is a company having real product #xrp with high profile people on the top. If it is a fraud I can sue them. Who will you sue if u find bitcoin a scam?
6970 2018-01-09 16:13:18 No news on that yet as far as I've heard
6971 2018-01-09 16:13:15 Short attention spans are catching up to us. Everything we see on TV should be the president, and every crypto currency is the new cash.

6987 2018-01-09 16:12:11 How do you find low cap coins? @opandam1 actually im new in crypto world. Any suggestions obviously i will research before buying those coins. Just recommendation in which you have invested or plan to invest. I know no financial advice @opandam1
6988 2018-01-09 16:12:09 als bitcoin omlaag gaat zeg je niet dat hij omlaag gaat maar: buy the dip en als hij omhoog gaat: hodl. Gaan de crypto beleggers prachtig vinden. :-)
6989 2018-01-09 16:12:01 Let's talk about crypto.
6990 2018-01-09 16:12:00 Great call i have been waiting, pretty sure its being held back by #XRP However hold on because when it goes it will GO! #cryptocurrency #HODLsquad #Crypto
6991 2018-01-09 16:11:54 In other words, the crypto trend continues. For some countries, that's liberation.
6992 2018-01-09 16:11:53 I didn't choose the crypto life, the crypto life chose me! $Crypto
6993 2018-01-09 16:11:51 Ripple is not perfect. Nothing is. But it is delivering at an amazing pace. XRP has a better chance of taking over payments and replacing fiat currencies than the rest. You can like it or not. Your choice. Facts are facts.
6994 2018-01-09 16:11:50 Nemecko nemohlo viac podporovať rozvoj crypto projektov. Daňový raj pre crypto + k tomuto tieto "progresívne" zákony. Well done Germany.
6995 2018-01-09 16:11:49 I was talking to a newbie about crypto the other day. She asked if I had a side hustle aside from crypto. She was confused, didn't understand crypto IS my side hustle.
6996 2018-01-09 16:11:48 im trying to figure out what you're circling there
6997 2018-01-09 16:11:48 Satoshi created Bitcoin to *eventually* replace cash and Bitcoin Cash is following that path while BTC (Bitcoin Core) has abdicated.  Honestly explain the low fees of BCH to your grocer, barber and restaurant owner and compare to BTC lack of utility.

7006 2018-01-09 16:11:32 why
7007 2018-01-09 16:11:30 American's monetary isolation is a huge barrier to crypto acceptance. We get caught up in the $/coin trends when dealing with petty cash.  Rest of the world deals with the foreign exchange daily

7011 2018-01-09 16:11:19 No, he did already say it will be on the 14th of jan. 6th he said he would update about the partnerships (who were already there) and the next week he would announce a new partnership. He couldnt tell yet because the new partner wants to first announce themselfs. So maybe on CES.

7015 2018-01-09 16:11:12 My crypto portfolio has been treading water the last week or so near all time highs which is starting to make me feel like I need to do something.

Typing this out forces me to internalize how ridiculous that sounds.
7016 2018-01-09 16:11:06 good strategy
7017 2018-01-09 16:11:03 This could be the first day in about a month where I do not make a single trade.  Come on BTC where is the infamous volatility I keep hearing about!!

7023 2018-01-09 16:10:36 @haydentiff we're in a massive crypto bubble, $doge is up over 7000% without releasing so much as an update in over two years. This will not last and we are going to see a bear market very soon. People who invest their life savings into $xrp now will be ruined.
7024 2018-01-09 16:10:32 Sell half on a 20x and keep the rest.
7025 2018-01-09 16:10:32 $DOT is the official coin of @Cryptopia_NZ and has a marketcap of 20M$...
 
@kucoincom has a marketcap of 1.6B$

@binance_2017 has a marketcap of 1.75B$

Yet @Cryptopia_NZ has more users than both of them (1.4M users on Cryptopia)

Do the math! This is a 25-30x coin

7048 2018-01-09 16:08:50 How to be a self starter in crypto. ICO reviews are not hard. What seems difficult to me is doing it right from start to finish.

7058 2018-01-09 16:08:00 Great Job ExchangeCoin. It's your time to shine. Bittrex and Binance are fully loaded with traffic and unable to accept new sign up until they got their upgrades. Hope to see your exchange up soon and do some referral commission on it like Binance.

7063 2018-01-09 16:07:19 From my point of view this is crime. Spread false accusations against other companies to harm them.. Its like apple is openly spreading false info about google to harm a competitor.

7086 2018-01-09 16:05:44 everyday companys drop its use less places accept it and somehow people think its valuable without creating the ecosystem for it you cant create a currency that noone will use then think people it doesnt benefit will sell you goods for it its community failed it being lazy

Coin 2: 

$KCS - You get bonuses for holding the coin, discounted fees, plus its skyrocketing.

7165 2018-01-09 16:01:08 Ok no worries, just thought I'd give you some cool info.  I don't know why people are so close-minded especially in crypto, it's beyond me.  Btw, the life insurance portion is minimized and the investment vehicle inside of it is maximized, it has little to do with life insurance.
7166 2018-01-09 16:01:04 Since I'm new in the game, I try to keep those who I follow for crypto pretty small. So I vet their prediction history. I use the "from:" and "until:YYYY-MM-DD" qualifiers. Oddly, @MrCryptoes is the only username that Twitter search doesn't recognize.

7201 2018-01-09 15:59:19 Mate les live streaming de @justinsuntron le ceo! C’est un projet sur le très long terme, il veulent entrer en concurrence avec Spotify, l’app store ect... pour l’instant c’est de la spéculation mais si le projet se concrétise ça peut être gros,je garde 1000$ de $trx au cas où 
7202 2018-01-09 15:59:17 Love the vids, and your generosity to charities at Christmas.. now how about spending a few of those coins for a picture or two on the wall eh?

7204 2018-01-09 15:59:11 Ur nickname mate it speaks for itselfs calling people fascist 
7205 2018-01-09 15:59:05 I will just wannna know your thoughts about it. Thank you.
7206 2018-01-09 15:59:05 Biology is a reward protocol. Capitalism is a reward protocol. Charity is a reward protocol. Democracy is a reward protocol.

Crypto allows us to design reward protocols.
7207 2018-01-09 15:59:02 Added you to list.
7208 2018-01-09 15:59:01 @JeffBezos Sir, you are a visionary! As such, I believe that you must be watching the crypto currency revolution happening at the moment.  Why not use Amazon's infrastructure to set up a RELIABLE crypto exchange. I can only imagine the strategical potential of such project.
7209 2018-01-09 15:59:01 Buy a Coin.  
Have a Plan.  
Set a Sell Order.  
Take Profits. 
Re-Buy at 20% to 80%  cheaper territory.  
Buy something else that is CHEAP, and @crypto_rand or @cryptomocho likes.   Chaise Lounge.  
Sunscreen  
Cold Drink.     
Nap.      
Rinse Sand off.  
Repeat Daily.
7210 2018-01-09 15:59:01 That is genuinely possible.
7211 2018-01-09 15:59:00 Wow nice crowd. AI is the future. One of my top holds for 2018!
7212 2018-01-09 15:58:54 I meant crypto currency. It’s only a matter of time until the counterfeiting flourishes.
7213 2018-01-09 15:58:51 Why would Facebook need red coin, Mark Zuckerberg is studying Crypto‘s and the Blockchain and once he figures out what he really needs to know he’s just going to incorporate his own coin for Facebook and decentralize Facebook and compete with Steemit.
7214 2018-01-09 15:58:47 @LuckySe7en thanks!! Ugh. There's not enough time in the day to be as much of a crypto junkie as id like to be. I already gave up sleep....
7215 2018-01-09 15:58:40 Bitcoin is great in many ways. But it is too slow, and expensive to use for the problem of cross-border payments. Also, bitcoin can only transmit bitcoin. Ripple can transmit all sorts of value types, Fiat currencies, other cryptos, air miles, shoes... whatever.
7216 2018-01-09 15:58:39 @unclemurda Unk I need help buying Ripple. Everything overloaded I can't find a way. #Crypto
7217 2018-01-09 15:58:38 If I’ve learned anything between the SEO, film and crypto worlds, it’s that you have to block out all the additional noise.
7218 2018-01-09 15:58:38 up .co
7219 2018-01-09 15:58:38 Just bought some $mtl - hopefully a BIG pump after it's 50% drop - thanks to @Socal_crypto for the tip! #MTL #bitcoin #crypto
7220 2018-01-09 15:58:36 Glad you’re ok. Out of curiosity, which token was dropped?
7221 2018-01-09 15:58:34 College student would kill for this 
7222 2018-01-09 15:58:32 China is the largest gold buyer for 20 years Bitcoin is devalueing gold there trillions in gold vs billions in bitcoin theres your incentive and its not a democracy there overnight the government could seize control of the miners and do this
7223 2018-01-09 15:58:32 If you’re referring to #POE, I own 600k shares. I want everyone to succeed in this #crypto community. Was just pointing out that it’s illogical for #tron to be worth 30x what #POE is worth. Wish you luck in your investments (yes, I’m in fact an investor).  $poe $trx $tron
7224 2018-01-09 15:58:31 Fascism?.. Libtards are trying to force others to accept 100genders everything and one is RACIST bigot Nazi Russian or phobic something or other ...heck they are trying to remove history ..trying to remove 1A2A..PFF
7225 2018-01-09 15:58:28 dawg low crypto loool
7226 2018-01-09 15:58:25 "Mine your own Bit-ness" I coined that. Cheesy?
7227 2018-01-09 15:58:25 Great things are coming to the bitcoin and crypto world, its never to late to make a start!!!
7228 2018-01-09 15:58:22 Nooo I just sold after a month of no gains
7229 2018-01-09 15:58:19 And what are they - specifically - doing, except shouting MEW hacks with zero evidence?
7230 2018-01-09 15:58:18 Gotcha. Obviously it's all speculation but what do you think are the chances of crypto getting seriously regulated in the US? What do you think are the incentives of regulation vs taxation by the government?
7231 2018-01-09 15:58:17 you have to set up an account at one of these exchanges, like BitStamp, which I dont recommend. I can tell you that one fund mgr I spoke to in Russia today said it took her WEEKS to buy ripple, too. This is how it goes in crypto...
7232 2018-01-09 15:58:15 You changed mine for getting me into crypto, thankful 
7233 2018-01-09 15:58:02 Followed and Alerts turned On! Liking your calls .. now I just need to get in on them 
7234 2018-01-09 15:57:57 Crypto market is ready for another bull run. Neo is smashing is already. #neo #tron #ADA #gto
7235 2018-01-09 15:57:50 What timezone are you in?
7236 2018-01-09 15:57:47 They had no choice, it was either add Bcash to their platform or face a lawsuit from my understanding.
7237 2018-01-09 15:57:44 Nah I’m speaking on a panel there about music and art on using crypto
7238 2018-01-09 15:57:44 その時の気分なり〜〜
7239 2018-01-09 15:57:38 Yeah i saw MEW had cleared that up and that the twitter account BLUE linked was a fake. I appreciate the concern on BLUE's part, but this was treated as pretty serious and may damage BLUE's reputation. What a shame.
7240 2018-01-09 15:57:37 And I get 100s of messages from crypto "traders" who have major losses
7241 2018-01-09 15:57:34 I know quite a few people that come from very old money.  I'm good on that investment advice thank you.
7242 2018-01-09 15:57:33 HODLLL
7243 2018-01-09 15:57:28 100k?
7244 2018-01-09 15:57:25 you missed the #Crypto #cryptocurrencies hashtags
7245 2018-01-09 15:57:21 You are harming the crypto community with the pathetic endorsements of stupid projects and coins used for nothing more than P&Ds. How you spend your crypto is of no one's concern.
7246 2018-01-09 15:57:20 This is one with both a great chart and a terrific team/vision, can't wait to see where it goes.
7247 2018-01-09 15:57:19 @KFOGRadio thanks for your "unbiased" segment today on #Trump. As long as #liberals continue to choose Muslims over gays, rigged elections over democracy, criminals over police, illegal aliens over citizens, you'll find yourself in the same place you are today.
7248 2018-01-09 15:57:19 Like a sir @crypto_rand
7249 2018-01-09 15:57:15 You're just like a big crypto nerd now ain't cha lol. Glad it's going well!
7250 2018-01-09 15:57:12 $TRX.X 1 % of the world knows about crypto we  have time
7251 2018-01-09 15:57:12 Anything yet?
7252 2018-01-09 15:57:10 No. you was wrong. I have no BCC. I’m fan of crypto currency except lending platform. However i don’t think BCC is scammer. Investors will decide BCC will fall or grow up. They have money, they have their own knowledge.
7253 2018-01-09 15:57:07 Buy your R.E.  and pay yiur broker in crypto..... Semd me a msg..
7254 2018-01-09 15:57:03 I just invested 1% of my portfolio in Nebula ( $NAS ) - Another one, I see good growth potential in. Do your own research, as always in $CRYPTO !
7255 2018-01-09 15:56:56 Dude Austin is awesome! Great choice
7256 2018-01-09 15:56:52 3 digits this year for $ARK
7257 2018-01-09 15:56:49 So etherscan just dropped my token from my wallet I deleted my tweets so I do not cause FUD. I have transferred all funds to hardware wallet and feel much more secure! Thank you all for your help!
7258 2018-01-09 15:56:49 Have you had a resolution? I'm still waiting. No reply from Hitbtc to my emails since Saturday. This is ridiculous!
7259 2018-01-09 15:56:42 You can now trade $pac vs ETH on @YobitExchange - much better than the 50-100% spread vs BTC on @Cryptopia_NZ... Exactly what we needed to get the FUD out (good pair/liquidity). Buy it up before it takes off again. Apologies if this isn't new. @PacCoinArmy @PACcoinOfficial
7260 2018-01-09 15:56:40 Ripple, like many other cryptos allow two people to exchange value without needing a centralised, trusted authority. Ripple achieves this one way. Bitcoin achieves it another. Both have pros and cons. But bitcoin would not be as well suited to the problem Ripple are solving.
7261 2018-01-09 15:56:39 Noted
7262 2018-01-09 15:56:33 Not selling, just watching 
7263 2018-01-09 15:56:27 My Top Three Crypto Picks for 2018:

1. @BITCOlNCASH 
2. @iotatoken 
3. @DeepBrainChain
7264 2018-01-09 15:56:20 If you're holding for a year, then you'll most likely make money. I think this coin could be a $300-$1,000 crypto one day.
7265 2018-01-09 15:56:19 What is up in the world of crypto today?...technically? Bias is tilted to the downside on Bitcoin and Ripple, but there is consolidation going on
That fall yesterday, saw the price move below both the 100 and 200 hour MAs (blue and green lines in the chart below) and a trend…
7266 2018-01-09 15:56:18 BANG BANG!
7267 2018-01-09 15:56:17 More crypto posts! Say mean stuff about bitconnect! Go!
7268 2018-01-09 15:56:11 Thank you!
7269 2018-01-09 15:56:07 what’s the future looking like for $trx #tron #crypto
7270 2018-01-09 15:56:06 Ah koca Fatih sizden ne kadar uzağız...
7271 2018-01-09 15:56:04 De plus en plus méfiant par rapport à cette crypto...
7272 2018-01-09 15:56:02 #LTC is defo my favorite crypto to transfer money!
7273 2018-01-09 15:56:01 Crypto currencies - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple - are very volatile and the drivers are not clear. Very difficult to formulate views. Technicals are probably the only trading strategy.
7274 2018-01-09 15:56:00 Absurd, still no deposits received after 2 days!!!!!! Ticket ID #159695
I'll be looking for a compensation as this of course incurred in me losing money. Stop saying that is the ETH network congested
7275 2018-01-09 15:56:00 ...and Finesse, it don't make no sense #crypto
7276 2018-01-09 15:55:57 That applies to stocks, but I think more than 10% make money in crypto. “Almost” everything goes up in time in crypto.
7277 2018-01-09 15:55:40 Crypto Thots:
1.  Even during alt season, respect $BTC.  If you go 100% alts you're asking to get #rekt.
2.  TAKE PROFITS!  Every bag can't be a moon bag.  I sold $HST at 6k sats and $DNA at 4k sats.  What I missed out on doesn't matter anywhere near as much as what I gained (4x)
7278 2018-01-09 15:55:38 too bad 2018 is the year of crypto and not something good
7279 2018-01-09 15:55:34 Buy #kuboscoin or #kubo/btc in CE
The coin to move
7280 2018-01-09 15:55:21 What a boring ass day at work..wish I could trade crypto all day
7281 2018-01-09 15:55:21 18 hours since my bank cleared transaction and my wallet states "pending". this is incredibly slow and seems shady. ever hear of Mt Gox??? where's my CRYPTO????
7282 2018-01-09 15:55:16 @CoinMarketCap can you exclude Yobit price from the @B3Coins price. It's misleading
7283 2018-01-09 15:55:10 こんなかわゆいグレッチでベンジーにぶたレたら天国確定
7284 2018-01-09 15:55:10 @Crypto_yann Salut! Tu as des infos sur le $TRX et son potentiel sur le long terme? J'essaie de trouver une info concrète quelque part sur ça. Thanks
7285 2018-01-09 15:55:10 Yeah i liked you better as bojack 
7286 2018-01-09 15:55:10 いますぐhiuはいって
それやって
10000あげるからさ
7287 2018-01-09 15:55:10 Me please me, always wanted to join bu still cannot afford it...
7288 2018-01-09 15:55:04 A crypto wallet does not hold your crypto assets, those are always stored on their respective blockchain. 

A crypto wallet simply stores the private keys that allow you to move or spend your crypto assets.
7289 2018-01-09 15:55:02 I would like everyone who purchased ANY #altcoins in 2018 to sell. Dip BABY DIP  #HODL #crypto
7290 2018-01-09 15:55:01 Hope this's real
7291 2018-01-09 15:54:52 Is it goood time to get some $AION ?

7296 2018-01-09 15:54:30 If you want to pay less in taxes in crypto, understand why section 1256 was enacted. See how it does not apply to crypto but everything it was designed to stop still does.....
7297 2018-01-09 15:54:29 Joe, people are saying you don’t got no Crypto. Is that true? #NAVCoin for Privacy

7299 2018-01-09 15:54:07 When mass adoption occurs, the crypto world will be ready. Who needs more than Bitcoin, Iota and Neo? There is an argument at the moment for ethereum, but once Quantum Computing is around, not for long.
7300 2018-01-09 15:54:00 If you are new to crypto or are considering entering the market I would be happy to assist you in any way I can with No Strings Attached. Just send me a PM
7301 2018-01-09 15:53:59 Ifb
7302 2018-01-09 15:53:58 Me too, but they haven’t said how we will receive them yet. I assume to a nep 5 wallet like neon.
7303 2018-01-09 15:53:50 I don’t give free tutoring lessons. Sorry.
7304 2018-01-09 15:53:39 The wavesbtc chart kept faking me out, I think wavesusd might be the better predictor of breakouts

7307 2018-01-09 15:53:23 In my opinion I've seen nothing wrong with the site. I have $20,000 invested and i'm making $7k a month. But with anything in Crypto you just never know.
7308 2018-01-09 15:53:21 Ripple is becoming the go-to answer because it's building a crypto consortium of sorts with financial institutions, which makes XRP seem more stable and reliable than other coins

7310 2018-01-09 15:53:15 #RDD had a brilliant price... three weeks ago (10sat!) now is 16x more  OMG Would be another 16x
7311 2018-01-09 15:53:12 Awesome sir. Truth always finds haters. Hats off to you to openly speak about it.
When something is decentralised as a crypto currency , everyone knows it will be used for these purposes.
7312 2018-01-09 15:53:06 Can any1 suggest a good #crypto tracker to help keep an eye on progress in one place?Dont need to manage anything simply see the prices rise and fall, got @peachteaboba 's #Bitworth on my iPhone which is great but looking for another one? #cryptocurrency #Ethereum #XLM #XRP #OMG

7316 2018-01-09 15:52:37 Thanks for the response... I was interested in $DADI. I love your perspective on trading crypto. I’m following it so far... for me it’s all about platform, solution, leadership team, and potential return. Can’t stand the pump and dump game.
7317 2018-01-09 15:52:35 Same in Canada. I think the issue is not crypto or not, it's the US banking system.
7318 2018-01-09 15:52:25 We need to get listed @KIN_KING_CRYPTO
7319 2018-01-09 15:52:18 @Haejin_Crypto hey can you please make a video on $TRX that would be great!
7320 2018-01-09 15:52:09 Is Klingon a possibility? Crypto is out of this world right now.
7321 2018-01-09 15:52:09 Are you TRYING to kill crypto? Not that you could, but if anyone was trying it would be impossible to do better than you.
7322 2018-01-09 15:52:02 shots fired
7323 2018-01-09 15:51:58 Not crypto, alt-money, or altmon

7325 2018-01-09 15:51:44 What is $XVG??

REAL people. 
REAL products. 
REAL vision. 
REAL customers.
REAL privacy.

FROM the people, FOR the people. The fastest growing Crypto and a true contender to $BTC.

$XVG is not a revolution, it's an EVOLUTION.

@vergecurrency @Verge_PR #VergeFam
7326 2018-01-09 15:51:34 That's very true
7327 2018-01-09 15:51:30 We have a pretty good team of designers, the site is not finished but I am open to suggestions in DM. Thanks!
7328 2018-01-09 15:51:29 @Haejin_Crypto 
Look at $Ark today!!! And so much room to grow!
Again, thanks for the tip! 
I like you, you're gonna be one of the last ones I kill when I buy my IronMan-suit with all this money...
7329 2018-01-09 15:51:27 No. 

It keeps the value you selected last time. 

The gas price has no _real_ default, it’s just the amount you’re willing to pay. It fluctuates a little, keep up to date with it with @ETHGasStation
7330 2018-01-09 15:51:17 İlgin için teşekkür ederim
7331 2018-01-09 15:51:06 To anyone saying I'm trying to "Pump and Dump" these coins I'm talking about. THINK for a minute, do you really think I can push people to invest $400,000,0000 in a day?! I'm a Crypto News channel, I talk about Crypto. That's what I do. I'm not a Pump and Dumper!
7332 2018-01-09 15:50:59 I agree, I feel like the crypto market is boiling. Total cap went down from 825 to 700, now 740. I think we are are booming up again :)
7333 2018-01-09 15:50:45 #Paccoin is now worth around 0.0002$ and they want to swap for new coin with ratio 1000:1 which mean its value will be $0.20 per $Paccoin. Not attractive for small investors. @PACCoinWhale @PacCoinArmy @PACcoinOfficial @paccoin_net #paccoin #pac #trx #xp
7334 2018-01-09 15:50:42 Can anyone explain the persistent price difference between $xcp on polo and bittrex?

7336 2018-01-09 15:50:35 Regulation will kill off crypto currencies not completely but almost dead. Ripple will stand because it's practical application and it's not decentralised.
7337 2018-01-09 15:50:34 we can agree that we obviously have a different experiential background. i thought it was your choice, did not want to make fun of you.

7340 2018-01-09 15:50:23 It is not a weak statement. It's like being the only one on a airplane with a parachute and saying to everyone around you how great it is to not waste money on parachutes.

7345 2018-01-09 15:50:06 @Crypto_goat_ Sir please what is your opinion on TRX, Tron?is it worth investing and a crypto with a future?
7346 2018-01-09 15:50:05 100% Less coins on Bancor. Starting to think this train to going to be a lot slower than I first anticipated but the chart looks great...
7347 2018-01-09 15:49:59 i m not sure your can grow up...look..your not have effort to make investor trust you..look your rate...just $0.27..FREZEE...disappointed with you tex..So weak..your make your investor so sad..What happen with you....Can You Explain To US..because without us..Tex is Nothing..
7348 2018-01-09 15:49:58 They are literally pushing fascism. It’s disgusting.
7349 2018-01-09 15:49:55 Just to confirm at MEW is still safe for communities to use?
7350 2018-01-09 15:49:49 Give me a follow and I'll have drugs and prostitutes sent straight to your home that were paid for by crypto..
7351 2018-01-09 15:49:48 Can you make a video on Crypto Taxes for 2017..?
7352 2018-01-09 15:49:42 TRX is still consolidating. Breakout will take place before the announcement is made. Patience TRX FAM #TRX #TRON #cryptocurrency #Crypto #bitcoin
7353 2018-01-09 15:49:23 I think you are really wrong in calling $XRP the devil and also using hashtags for no reason. Maybe trying to get some people on your side or something, but the key here is that XRP will allow banks to trust into Crypto. Result: people will trust in Crypto.
7354 2018-01-09 15:49:20 A todos los mineros que se registraron los obligarán a cambiar sus Crypto por petros y ya, robados sin pistola

7359 2018-01-09 15:49:02 Granted we are all here to make money.  But let's not forget to take some of those gains and invest in crypto companies that are doing things to push the decentralization movement forward. Energy, Banking, etc. @ethlend1 @energo2017 and many many more. #crypto #dyor
7360 2018-01-09 15:48:59 thanks Ed .. much appreciated
7361 2018-01-09 15:48:57 Hi Guys has anyone been thinking why this crypto doesn't have whitepaper and team outlined. J think it's getting small red light. It's worth to risk small amount  $EXRN

7375 2018-01-09 15:48:08 Guys new coin ratio 1000:1 is not attrative for investors. If I own 1m coin today meaning I will only have 1000 coins   when swap happened. Value can stay the same but nowadays 1000 coins like nothing. Small investor like me rather buy DENT or Doge.. any coin around 1c or less

7383 2018-01-09 15:47:49 Using a percentage as a representative proportion of such a large population is more than a little disingenuous; it's still a market of over a million crypto users, and in a rapidly advancing nation. It's impossible to predict the potential market, as it's always changing.

7388 2018-01-09 15:47:24 I started with crypto only a few moths back (so an expert :p) and was looking into lots of communities, and in the end ended up with #DeepOnion, because all they did looked like how I would have. If into communities check out @CryptoinfoNet as well - they are building!

7394 2018-01-09 15:47:10 The biggest problem old school investors have is seeking approval from the very fine not like institutions the blockchain was designed to eliminate. When you go crypto , go all crypto, do not sell for fiat, do not watch the fiat price. Exit the matrix before the doors are shut!
7395 2018-01-09 15:47:10 Well if #crypto is a scam and fraud as you previously stated, why would the government want to control it? Just admit it, you know nothing about the millenials and their true demands..
7396 2018-01-09 15:47:09 #Fascism
7397 2018-01-09 15:47:06 It’s a hodl. China had 90% of the crypto transactions before. Now it's 7% or less. This happened at 3K levels.  It's also good (if) it happens mining centralization will go, which is extremely good. Note BTC has miners outside china, whereas BCH has majority running in China.
7398 2018-01-09 15:46:58 breakout = ~92K?
7399 2018-01-09 15:46:52 3 ) We need to  thought about these question . Even if #Crypto is the  Future , we must be considered that 's not all of the Crypto Coin will existed in future . #TRX #XRP #BTC
7400 2018-01-09 15:46:50 I was in ua state before but realized later that how good of a crypto it is...$VTC is the only crypto that didn’t fall even the worst bump in the crypto world. Means the community trust it so strong #VTC....you can’t be rich over night... have some trust #VTC $VTC

7413 2018-01-09 15:46:03 I was just reading about crypto being hacked etc when the postman turned up. A letter from equifax saying they had been hacked and all my info and credit card number may be at risk 
7414 2018-01-09 15:46:00 Well that's right. It's a good thing the Fichte-Schelling-Hegel line came and put that crypto-liberal to shame.
7415 2018-01-09 15:46:00 Long target? Will it break $btc ath 470k?
7416 2018-01-09 15:45:53 Well the relative cost of BTC needs to be taken into account as well since USD valuations influence BTC valuation and trader mentality, especially new traders.

7434 2018-01-09 15:44:45 I initiated a bank transfer 5(!) days ago and the money still isn't there.  Meanwhile I can send bitcoin and it's there in less than a minute.

7453 2018-01-09 15:43:50 I don’t know if Coinbase will like a no-fee crypto. A new company/startup must come out that enables USD to XRB directly like Coinbase allows USD to BTC/ETH/LTC/BCH. It will change how people enter into cryptos, and Coinbase will lose out bigly.

7494 2018-01-09 15:41:06 It's just common.  It's much more interesting that you bought a car with crypto, and would be more still if you traded with someone like Starbucks or CITGO or Walmart
7495 2018-01-09 15:41:05 crypto is global. move country. you cant stop it.
7496 2018-01-09 15:41:02 I am not a bitcoin fan but lichting could reduce thousands of transaction to one ! Why is that not gonna solve anything?

7503 2018-01-09 15:40:36 So that translate to roughlt 15-14k in fiat/tether and then being able to buy $BTC at 7-8k each? ugh so confused if this is not what you meant. 

Ps: This is how you make people panic sell, you guys are discusting. I love it #crypto

So in summary, Byteball provides:  low energy costs as no mining is done, human readable smart contracts, ability to send crypto, USD, commodities, or arbitrary data by public addy, email or messenger1/2

Only a banked person would suggest something as ludicrous as eliminating banking.

There will be a massive market crash for crypto currency very soon & Than again market will go for correction . Many crypto's has very poor fundamentals

7523 2018-01-09 15:39:44 So $BCash has Bitcoin's Twitter, a copy of it's code, and a spot on the most popular US fiat gateway: Coinbase.

Used to be just China FUD, but the threats to Bitcoin have spread and grown massively in the past year.

People have to understand that if Bitcoin fails, crypto fails
7524 2018-01-09 15:39:43 Could be some sort of bias on my part but I've come across a lot of bitcoin/crypto evangelists that are women. I am very much, however, outside of the crypto world.
7525 2018-01-09 15:39:31 Probably right
7526 2018-01-09 15:39:29 @kurdiferhad1 you could have used a phishing site and lost all your money. Next time check the link you click and sign in. And use etherscan to track your account. Stop blaming others for your stupidity.

7550 2018-01-09 15:38:23 GDAX is so popular because you allow the average Joe to use their credit card and buy Crypto. Exchanges offering the same are coming quickly so you're going to be left behind unless you start releasing more coins. Surely releasing say 3 coins at once will ease demand on just 1?!?
7551 2018-01-09 15:38:23 Just used MEW last night. I know Im good with MEW and hardware wallet
7552 2018-01-09 15:38:15 Bro, you are straight manic. It might be a good idea to find a more stable place for yourself than crypto. Offered with kind wishes.
7553 2018-01-09 15:38:13 That would be awesome, but I think with these millions of new users the crypto space is completely different today than 4 years ago.
7554 2018-01-09 15:38:12 6 of them are on my list too.

7561 2018-01-09 15:37:48 I've never wondered what a transaction fee equates to in USD.
7562 2018-01-09 15:37:48 You’re a crypto noob. Forget it.

7575 2018-01-09 15:37:05 wut? o.0

There were enough pumps in 2014 and enough reversals as well imo?

7579 2018-01-09 15:37:01 That's a scary chart for bitcoin hodlers. But does it take into account the rest of the crypto space as a whole? Bitcoin dominance may be down, but the overall market cap is even closer to a trillion than ever.
7580 2018-01-09 15:36:56 Haha you're crazy man. Keep up the great crypto work.

7585 2018-01-09 15:36:29 Why have crypto currency when you could have cryptid currency? Put bigfoot on the quarter!
7586 2018-01-09 15:36:28 Simply because it’s one of a few coins left on bittrex that hasn’t pumped, was looking at it but went with $CRB & $GAME instead
7587 2018-01-09 15:36:24 I like BTC but lightning will solve nothing, there is term in programming GIGO that applies to BTC in the realm of large scaling ability - it was not designed to handle large volume from the start.

If not feel free to DM, I can give you some resources.  It will absolutely blow your socks off.  I don't sell them.
7591 2018-01-09 15:36:18 As clear as always. Your best crypto team out there. good to see. $XRB
7592 2018-01-09 15:36:10 I think he has to add custom tokens to see if his tokens are there. Everytime MEW is accessed you won’t see your tokens untill they are custom added. Some tokens might be there but to see all you need to custom add all of them. And check ether scan to see your token status.

7596 2018-01-09 15:35:59 This move by Microsoft is potentially huge for $NEO, as NEO is part of blockchain business, not Gen 1 Crypto and Microsoft know that implicitly

7598 2018-01-09 15:35:49 so many crypto ppl are talking shit about Jamie. Small minds, Jamie can buy them 100x over
7599 2018-01-09 15:35:40 Every project has their base.  I think it's great that people get excited about crypto.  However, #DeepOnion is 6 months old, no ICO, no big money, no big business;  just a grassroots movement with 10K+ members and growing. It's what crypto should be.
7600 2018-01-09 15:35:37 "There's better, more efficient alternatives that can actually be used now. But wait for lightning instead!"

This sort of mentality is damaging the cryptospace as a whole. It's turned BTC into nothing more than a useless speculative investment.

7650 2018-01-09 15:32:15 @RevolutApp All your material says you are offering crypto exchange for free but when I try to trade the app says I have to be a premium user or sign up other customers for you. When will it be free and will you amend your docs which are misleadkng and incorrect?
7651 2018-01-09 15:32:12 Lol. I really thought you were just being sarcastic about paying for all that shit with crypto. Thought you were just messing with the haters.
7652 2018-01-09 15:32:10 Done!
7653 2018-01-09 15:32:09 You tell me, Mr. Anonymous.

7661 2018-01-09 15:31:32 @elkwood66 @mintcapital The fact that people keep believing that $XNET is a "Chinese blockchain" company has to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Even when the company comes out and says "we are not selling crypto" or "we are just experimenting" people just salivate

7665 2018-01-09 15:31:21 Crypto:  where you spend time at your job making money while being paid to make money doing crypto until you make enough doing crypto to quit all your jobs and spend your time doing crypto like it was two full time jobs.
7666 2018-01-09 15:31:20 Well then prove to me Bcash is a widespread payment mechanism. Cause everyone I know is using this crazy thing called dollars.
7667 2018-01-09 15:31:19 Are you talking about the tm3k terminator?  I love cool robots, but you lost me sister.
7668 2018-01-09 15:31:16 I  understand..it's hard to lose control and even harder watching power seep away from your hands .. ALL banks and Govts will go to any length to stop this digital revolution, because they want to control us.

7690 2018-01-09 15:30:00 Hard to miss the irony that the only real bubbles post-GFC have been in assets seen as "protection" from from asset bubbles and policy errors: gold and crypto. Maybe the real bubble was in paranoia...

7704 2018-01-09 15:29:24 kind of wild that you can have saying $10,000 or $100,000 invested in stocks or crypto and until you cash out its all just imaginary money lmao
7705 2018-01-09 15:29:21 #1 thing I’ve learned on crypto twitter. I need to seriously improve my GIF game
7706 2018-01-09 15:29:15 Ifb
7707 2018-01-09 15:29:10 People  are missing the point, its noob bait......

"$15,000 bitcoin, I'm never going to afford that"

"ooooh, 1 and a half cents for a bit? gimme a $1000 worth!"

Dont let your crypto adjusted brain let you think average joe can grasp 0.000001 for the same thing..... :D
7708 2018-01-09 15:29:05 Does your #crypto even have value?

1. Does it have utility?
2. Can it scale?
3. Is it backed by a reputable Co. or Org.?
4. Is it more than just a store of value?
5. Do you feel ok buying it and ignoring it for a mos/yr?

If No, re-evaluate your investment.

7713 2018-01-09 15:28:53 Potentially. Subwaves 3-3-3-3-3 are there though.
7714 2018-01-09 15:28:52 It's a simple fact that like any fiat currency, crypto will also be used to buy dope, pussy and liquor. Stable products for which there is always demand regardless of how the economy is doing. If it cant survive being used for the same purposes, then it has no chance at all.
7715 2018-01-09 15:28:50 Chill? In my opinion Its in acumulate mode and rdy to boom :.
7716 2018-01-09 15:28:45 Govt have the ability to control all cryptocurrency. Unless crypto move to the black market.

7739 2018-01-09 15:27:04 Thank you @ZekeOsborne , My story is similar to you're. however I made my fortune and fame on Silk Road. With my new found riches I devoted my life to charting and analytics associated with the crypto-trading. I buy high and sell low, its my way of giving back.

7759 2018-01-09 15:26:01 Mate do you understand my point of view ???? You are the one is narrow minded. If ripple decentralised than ripple will blow up quick. You still going on about other facts. Read first
7760 2018-01-09 15:25:52 @Asaks02 do you offer crypto trade coaching?
7761 2018-01-09 15:25:50 Right! Everyone need to stop panic selling there coins..
7762 2018-01-09 15:25:50 I told everyone in crypto ik to buy 0x and TRON on December 5th and now they r saying "o shit" LOL
7763 2018-01-09 15:25:48 Tolerating the intolerance?

7765 2018-01-09 15:25:37 Good we need this to hold for Alts to flourish
7766 2018-01-09 15:25:34 It’s interesting to say the least. I am of the mindset though, however that as a burgeoning industry/class, it just shows how immature crypto is still.

That one site alone could produce with a quick and significant result like that.
7767 2018-01-09 15:25:27 for all the crypto investors on here have any of you tried selling? If so how long did it take and what price did the exchange give you?
7768 2018-01-09 15:25:25 Yea please.  Finally dove into crypto in early December after watching from the sidelines since early 2017. Would love to continue to explore the space with other people interested and active in it.

7770 2018-01-09 15:25:18 Congress obviously does not work for their constituents but for Wall Street. The new tax law cheats crypto traders by taxing every single transaction. Not just profits....every transaction.

7794 2018-01-09 15:23:23 Made my first crypto trade, dilly dilly
7795 2018-01-09 15:23:22 $SC already done nearly x10 in last couple of weeks, it’s probably going to chill for a bit
7796 2018-01-09 15:23:22 I think it was an escrow movement? But it didn't show up as such.  Who knows
7797 2018-01-09 15:23:21 Nice call.
7798 2018-01-09 15:23:15 Someone on the @hqtrivia chat told me to buy Bitcoin so I think it's time I take this crypto thing seriously
7799 2018-01-09 15:23:12 So now the latest press says Ethereum is overloaded can’t handle all of the exchanges and is now over pricing their exchanges. Will that bring Ethereum back down ? that story was fresh this morning?  how long will it take for the reaction to recalibrate it’s price?
7800 2018-01-09 15:23:11 My man! Getting into the crypto game allright
7801 2018-01-09 15:23:07 Bitcoin prize is dropping. What are you waiting for buy some right now!!!!#sageadvise#cryptolife#makemoney
7802 2018-01-09 15:23:05 I think that DeepOnion will be the best crypto of 2018, i’am sure of this and every time is possible i invest on this amazing project, just see also the roadmap for see how serious is DeepOnion and their Devs
7803 2018-01-09 15:22:54 $KIN and $TRX are the only crypto currencies with a user base in the millions.  Look at the marketcap and tell me which one you think will 5x in 6 months.  Then go buy it ;)

$air $strat $btg $synx $swt $ppc $cvc $qtum $ada $ardr $nxt $btc $eth $ltc $etc $zcl $xvg $xrp $xem
7804 2018-01-09 15:22:52 2 dat walking trip to Inle Lake. Here we go. No #crypto  the next days.
7805 2018-01-09 15:22:51 See a lot people complaining about 'Ruining the image of crypto' pretty certain the volume of people trading crypto is at an all time high, theres been thousands of news stories that slander crypto currencey but it just keeps getting stronger.
7806 2018-01-09 15:22:50 True!  Calming 
7807 2018-01-09 15:22:43 Except nobody in the real world actually uses it.
7808 2018-01-09 15:22:38 Duh I didn’t need to be a CEO of the largest bank in the world to come up w that perspective however in the meantime crypto will make you tons of fiat
7809 2018-01-09 15:22:34 I believe the 12th. Salute
7810 2018-01-09 15:22:25 Not gonna happen in this decade
7811 2018-01-09 15:22:25 If its xrp its possible.  So long as its not xrp and there is internet freedom.  No one can control all crypto
7812 2018-01-09 15:22:23 You forget crypto is a new asset class, an ammendment of its own, trying to achieve mass adoption and dodge government regulation.
7813 2018-01-09 15:22:15 $strat Looks like its about to booooooom!!!

#bitcoin #crypto #altcoin
7814 2018-01-09 15:22:08 Buy your own block on our blockchain! The ultimate 'I was here' during the current Crypto frenzy! It only costs $1 and 50% goes to charity!
7815 2018-01-09 15:22:07 あぁ…メンテナンスなのね
7816 2018-01-09 15:22:00 I've heard people, real actual people- even use the U.S .Dollar to pay for arms, ..you know real life-ending weapons...Arsenal's of them...magazines of these terror machines. Something tells me crypto currencies are easier to track than the U.S. dollar,& are less counterfeitable²
7817 2018-01-09 15:21:54 $proc on @Cryptopia_NZ the buy order book has 5x the depth of the sell order book.. This coin is 100% going higher. I would buy now before if shoots up again. @procurrency_ #Altcoins $linda $pac $html
7818 2018-01-09 15:21:50 sounds like a typical girl's emotional range or the crypto market
7819 2018-01-09 15:21:47 So, this means that in 13 days market cap of Tron (with couple of student developers) will double the market cap of Bitcoin. I want the same thing that guy is smoking...
7820 2018-01-09 15:21:45 Yea but that would mean a drop in Bitcoin dominance to like 10% which I find hard to believe
7821 2018-01-09 15:21:33 @MyCryptoStats  Any chance we can get $LINDA, $OMGC, $CMPCO added to My Crypto Stats as well? :D
7822 2018-01-09 15:21:27 until few minutes back you were pinning the blame on Modi Govt for no ease of doing Biz because your remitance to & from crypto has been blocked. probably blocking such payments, the govt is safe guarding further damage. Risk was only and only yours. Crypto was never govt backed
7823 2018-01-09 15:21:25 わしは資産全然無いのでまだガチホは無理っすかねーｗ
もうちょい草刈りして資産伸ばして行きます
7824 2018-01-09 15:21:24 Why would anyone buy MIRA tokens:
Above all, by purchasing MIRA tokens, people are supporting a new, successful project that makes cryptocurrencies easy and accessible to everyone.

7825 2018-01-09 15:21:23 This guy does not know the actual purpose of crypto. Unfortunately, he has an audience.
7826 2018-01-09 15:21:22 lol ripple will get better for sre
7827 2018-01-09 15:21:20 nah its about we don't want to support ripple labs and the banking system. that's why xrp draws the disgust.
7828 2018-01-09 15:21:08 @socal_crypto What about $MEC
7829 2018-01-09 15:21:08 その頃には新規参入砲も威力弱くなってそうだからファンダ勝負かな(　˙-˙　)

7833 2018-01-09 15:20:45 Do you actually want about making money with crypto or was it just a setup for a joke?
7834 2018-01-09 15:20:44 27!

7837 2018-01-09 15:20:39 やるのはカナリめんどくさいですw
ですが、チャートの形は似てくる場面が沢山あります。海外のトレーダーさん達はパターンの図形で表現しそれを見てる沢山のトレーダーの心理がどう動くか考えてください。
7838 2018-01-09 15:20:30 I love John’s strategies and this is one of his best to raise funds for ICOs and crypto market. Thanks John we love you
7839 2018-01-09 15:20:28 Not at all. But there’s a thin line when you’re a public figure, with over 650k followers. Not giving the right impression for a market a lot bigger than yourself. These are not the key crypto use cases he stated.
7840 2018-01-09 15:20:09 Bitcoin en het woord betaalmiddel gaan niet echt meer samen. Gulden heeft een hele andere weg ingeslagen en wil een echt alternatief bieden voor de euro en niet andere crypto's. Bijna elke dag komen er wel nieuwe ondernemers bij en dat gaat goed zoals het nu gaat 
7841 2018-01-09 15:20:07 I like where your head is at....

7849 2018-01-09 15:19:52 Ofcourse not
7850 2018-01-09 15:19:49 Nobody “got” me into crypto. All I did was read tbh.
7851 2018-01-09 15:19:45 Its a good time to jump in in this dip, $xrp will grow
7852 2018-01-09 15:19:44 You are the best !! Ed !! !! Happy now !! Now tell me when to sell Stratis !!
7853 2018-01-09 15:19:44 I agree I have watched after the release of almost every news story , concerning the alt coins or Bitcoin , a reaction within the buying and selling of that coin. It appears as though this market is completely driven by hearsay and reaction!!
7854 2018-01-09 15:19:42 thanks Ed, i finally bought a coin at breakout that goes up 
7855 2018-01-09 15:19:39 Put them on the stupid money pile then, just as damaging to the crypto environment!
7856 2018-01-09 15:19:35 Just getting into this a couple weeks ago and honestly think I found my new passion! Now I’m a rapping chef crypto enthusiast!!!!

7860 2018-01-09 15:19:27 $TRX.X you know you are in a good crypto when you wake up every day hoping you are rich haha. Not today. :) maybe tomorrow monring.
7861 2018-01-09 15:19:03 What makes you think that?!
7862 2018-01-09 15:19:02 So lets start the Crypto Twitter journey... keep the faith in your dreams and your chosen ones.

My top 3 chosen ones are:
$Ethos $NEO and $STRAT

Chill me your chosen one and why:
7863 2018-01-09 15:18:56 私はCoinExchangeがうまく行かなかったので、以前はmonaから直接XP買いましたね。crypto-bridgeではできます。ただ、monaからXPを買うと損します。なので今ならchangelyなんかも使用して、LTC→DOGE→XPの順がいいかもです
7864 2018-01-09 15:18:55 Bitcoin Cash has already had > 1MB blocks which is not a problem because it is scalable. Bitcoin (Core) is not which is why tx fees are so high.
7865 2018-01-09 15:18:55 Please add $BTC and #Crypto to the list.  By relentlessly undermining our democratic institutions and destroying confidence in them, the longer, larger consequences will be a further removed and enraged electorate who first got ripped off by #WallStreet and now by #SiliconValley
7866 2018-01-09 15:18:50 Can u help a brotha build an audience for crypto trading/investing?
7867 2018-01-09 15:18:41 Crypto触らずFiatでスキャしてワキ汗かいてるんワイだけのよう

7869 2018-01-09 15:18:40 Into crypto? :)
7870 2018-01-09 15:18:39 えっ、なにこれは
7871 2018-01-09 15:18:30 is it to late to invest?
7872 2018-01-09 15:18:30 It’s harmful to say it in the sense that it gives politicians fuel for their narrative that crypto is being used for nefarious behavior.  “Crypto is being used by terrorists and drug addicts and prostitutes” they just need fuel for the narrative, it doesn’t have to be true
7873 2018-01-09 15:18:19 Need to hurry up
7874 2018-01-09 15:18:18 @cryptocaribbean beste cryptocaribbean, ik volg nu al een tijdje en wil even mijn dank uitspreken. Zit zelf pas in de crypto maar heb aan jouw calls echt veel gehad! mijn vraag is of je toevallig een telegram/discord groep of iets dergelijks hebt?  alvast bedankt
7875 2018-01-09 15:18:18 @crypto_axe @WandXDapp is slowly taking off! Now we need to get off EtherDelta to @kucoincom @binance_2017 @Cryptopia_NZ
7876 2018-01-09 15:18:14 You D is B actually. We will see real C at 12600
7877 2018-01-09 15:18:12 hodl stellar
7878 2018-01-09 15:18:11 2) Volume is there and we have already rebounded a tad since the tweet, we have resistance ahead but if volume keeps up as shown in the volume profile we are just fine, tons of support at the bottom of our flag.
7879 2018-01-09 15:18:10 Not trying to be the negative nancy but it's a promising project running into several timing hiccups, maybe all they need is a better project manager, but all these hiccups will lead to problems down the road if not addressed, even in community that mostly forgives everything
7880 2018-01-09 15:18:09 Your $CRYPTO assets keep gaining value, while your FIAT currency ( $USD / $EUR ) is losing it. Remember when you could pay your rent, fulfill your needs and enjoy life with a 1 income household? 
Yes. That's like ages ago.
7881 2018-01-09 15:18:01 ありがとうございます！
嬉しい
7882 2018-01-09 15:18:01 
7883 2018-01-09 15:18:00 Market manipulation - common in crypto. Attempts to get you in a bull trap then dump to take your money.
7884 2018-01-09 15:17:58 Au vu des tendances long termes $BTC sera probablement entre 100 000 et 200 000€ avant 2019

7885 2018-01-09 15:17:55 @COBINHOOD can you please add sending and receiving crypto and depositing fiat in the app from a card soon! Everything looks great so far!
7886 2018-01-09 15:17:51 $POE break 1295 SATS (yesterday hod) or clear 1300 (same thing will happen as $XVG yesterday) ...
1700 with a break of 1300 #POE

7887 2018-01-09 15:17:49 So that would tell me to avoid them like the plague.

7890 2018-01-09 15:17:40 1) Because most of the YouTubers are clueless. No offense to the ones who do know TA but as a whole they are not real traders. A-E appears completed within our triangle. See comment 2>
7891 2018-01-09 15:17:40 Whether it's a local change depends on which node you change. The sysadmin from ShadyISP Inc. can change the DNS for every one of their customers.

To clarify: I'm not trying to defend blue, I'm trying to convince MEW to get DNSSEC up.
7892 2018-01-09 15:17:34 Got both. Nice picks
7893 2018-01-09 15:17:22 Absolutely agreed. It's the true nature of blockchain: empowering communities and unleashing them from their potential by awarding them with more freedom.
7894 2018-01-09 15:17:22 $b3 confuses me
7895 2018-01-09 15:17:19 @Haejin_Crypto reall enjoying your videos !  When steemit (finally) approves (?) me, I will UPVOTE !
7896 2018-01-09 15:17:18 Thanks crypto!
7897 2018-01-09 15:17:14 #GDSI is in serious trouble with the sec and on the verge of suspension for being delinquent on their filings. They have lawsuits against them as well. For those saying #Gdsi will announce a new crypto business,your clueless..It’ll never pass the sniff test and be suspended..
7898 2018-01-09 15:17:12 Nice. Does Harvard have a crypto club?

(Found this for MIT @MITBitcoinClub )
7899 2018-01-09 15:17:11 Succes straks! #gogogo
7900 2018-01-09 15:17:05 Cool cool. I'm keeping all my coins for long term. I day trade currencies. You use binance for day trading crypto?
7901 2018-01-09 15:17:05 My Crypto Blog Content will be written by me and it will start with basics. I don't want anyone to lose money.

7905 2018-01-09 15:16:42 With some coins even that's not possible, but USDT works most of the time. With the usdt you collect from different tokens/coins you can then buy some crypto again.

7909 2018-01-09 15:16:20 The gas slider is a user configuration that is stored on the client. Looking for 41 Gwei instead of the domain you’re on is terrible advice.
7910 2018-01-09 15:16:11 haha love it, you're right.
7911 2018-01-09 15:16:02 Be ready for anything... There are ways you can position yourself to be ready for anything the market can throw at you. #bitcoin #altcoin #crypto
7912 2018-01-09 15:16:00 This is just the start. You’ve got a least 2-3 years before it settles. Try to relax and get a feel for it all.

7915 2018-01-09 15:15:44 “The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that."  What does one infer from "and stuff like that"? #Crypto #JamieDimon
7916 2018-01-09 15:15:42 This statement is the worst. The Infrastructure required to even create the internet is incredible. Without internet crypto wouldn't even exist.

7921 2018-01-09 15:15:31 If you’re worried about the complacency of #Bitcoin buyers, you should be just as worried about the complacency of #SP500 and broad market etf buyers at these P/E ratios. #Crypto investors can handle swings - SP500 investors are playing with their life savings and retirement.

7935 2018-01-09 15:14:28 What do you plan on doing with your new found early retirement from cultural enslavement?  I for one plan on traveling a LOT more, and sharing with everyone how crypto has transformed my life forever.
7936 2018-01-09 15:14:22 So If I bought $Xvg for $1000 sold half in a double and the just sat on my xvg I would make the safest  7million in history. Not to mention if I reinvested new $1000 in something like antshares I could make even more?
7937 2018-01-09 15:14:22 Brah what I'm saying is if you put 2.25 in crypto bullshit why wouldn't you sell at 18,000??
7938 2018-01-09 15:14:20 If a sysadmin in a corporation changes the DNS entry for any domain, that’s local to the corporation - it doesn’t affect anyone outside the corps network. 

You can even change your own host file to resolve a domain to whatever IP - but again, that’s a local change.
7939 2018-01-09 15:14:17 No movements since my entry post this signal! Any update what's happening on this? 2400 sats target movement are not like this!
7940 2018-01-09 15:14:17 MEW is safe. Proceed as usual. :)
7941 2018-01-09 15:14:05 Crypto currency is not desirable for 
1. Speculative nature 
2. No real assets backing value 
3. Deep web beyond law transactions including terror & human trafficking 
4. No Regulater no regulation just greed

On a scale of 1-10 how crazy are people about crypto in India?
7945 2018-01-09 15:13:54 Another prediction for 2018: The #crypto bubble will burst, and a winner could emerge, but probably not Bitcoin. It might be an unheard of, government run currency

7960 2018-01-09 15:13:11 The great Crypto Experiment is still going! Losses at 60%. SB is convinced @nitroweasel3k should ride out EVX. NW3k has already had a funeral for the money he lost on the TRX bust. The Xbox One's chances are looking pretty bad.
7961 2018-01-09 15:13:07 That's it! Bold, to the point, and for those still used to 2-5x sells... Welcome to crypto.

7963 2018-01-09 15:12:27 "When Wall Street bonuses hit bank accounts on January 15, I imagine we'll see a crypto buying spree of epic proportions," @Melt_Dem wrote on Twitter earlier this year.
7964 2018-01-09 15:12:26 Well freedom of speech, crypto isn't a holy Grail , let's just be ourselves

Think crypto kitties but for email... it'd be nice to know that I'm the _only possible_ recipient of an email, and there can only ever be one copy of it (screenshots aside). Also for DRM?

7981 2018-01-09 15:11:01 I was once one of those people...for about 2 days....until I realized the power of crypto and began trying to learn as much as I could.
7982 2018-01-09 15:11:00 1000$ x1500 = 1,5 mil not 15 mil....
7983 2018-01-09 15:10:53 It doesn't mean crypto currency can not be used to buy other things like coffee, cars etc..
7984 2018-01-09 15:10:47 Zuckerberg's personal mission statement for 2018 is to look into decentralization from the government through crypto and passing power back to the people. He wants to integrate with Facebook.

7985 2018-01-09 15:10:43 I don't know. BTC seems to be very stagnant right now. Not quite sure where this will go, but the market sentiment seems to be she is ready to break out and go on a huge run. A lot of YouTuber's share this opinion.
7986 2018-01-09 15:10:40 Once you go crypto there is no turning back.. haven't found the first person saying.  Yeah got tottaly out.. Once down the spiral there is no turning back. And yes the spiral could be dark or bright depends who's leading. 
7987 2018-01-09 15:10:34 XEM need include message to remittances, but I mistook it.

7989 2018-01-09 15:10:32 How about 1000x sir?
7990 2018-01-09 15:10:29 630 billion market cap is perfectly reasonable for an erc20 token big man. That's not even 3x on bitcoin. Be smart.
7991 2018-01-09 15:10:29 That’s most likely a user error (ie: they’ve been phished or given away their private key) and not a design flaw with MyEtherWallet itself.
7992 2018-01-09 15:10:23 I know !! I just want him to be more precise !! He is the only one who gives the quickest updates. If he took the criticism positively !! He'l be the best !! As they say !! To the moon

7994 2018-01-09 15:10:11 イナゴ＆狼狽、投資だけじゃなくて実生活でもあるあるだよね。人の意見に簡単に流されたり、意思決定の基準が曖昧だとこうなるんだろうね。。
7995 2018-01-09 15:10:09 I'm feeling the same way recently.  Everyone uses $ltc to transfer crypto now because it's insanely fast, but so many people dog Charlie and don't take him at his word.  I'm glad he dumped his ltc, it just means his interests are now more aligned with the users of this currency.

8012 2018-01-09 15:09:03 No, it does not agree with your very narrow view of crypto. But if you use your imagination and think of what could be achieved by using different cryptocurrencies in different ways, then there is a lot larger scope for change.
8013 2018-01-09 15:08:54 Why unspeakable? Why any shame at all? Virtually everyone does everything, or at least wishes to. With crypto you can easily transition from the latter to the former.

8025 2018-01-09 15:08:21 I just found out Ripple is a freaking company. * FACEPALM * And I thought crypto "investing" couldn't get any more counterproductive to the original goal.
8026 2018-01-09 15:08:20 Charts bro..though I don't look at charts in Crypto but Ripple looks set to blast off.
8027 2018-01-09 15:08:02 Amazing how the biggest scam in crypto is also the hardest working with the most innovations and largest team.
8028 2018-01-09 15:07:57 I'm interested
8029 2018-01-09 15:07:56 I don't like it. How can I tell the difference between your boring twitter and your Crypto twitter now?

8031 2018-01-09 15:07:52 Spot on way of looking at it. Survival of the fittest. So is BTC a dinosaur, headed for extinction, or Neanderthal man, fated to evolve?
8032 2018-01-09 15:07:49 How much $$$ do you need to make to call yourself a crypto-investor? 10$, 100$, 1000$ or 1m$? Do have to realized/liquidated?

[Asking for a friend.]
8033 2018-01-09 15:07:42 1/ We’re witnessing a new asset class that’s been accused by the less educated of indulging mainly in the aforementioned illegal activities you stated. And we’re trying to convince the world/governments that crypto has its real use cases too.
8034 2018-01-09 15:07:35 What’s your opinion on #XRP #Ripple, I have personally seen it fail being integrated with banks. They cannot solve for liquidity, if that’s the case why is everyone buying into it? #blockchain #cryptocurrency #Crypto #blockchaintechnology #tech #bitcoin #Ethereum #IOTA #xrp

8080 2018-01-09 15:04:07 .@jimmysong why not simply just use the "satoshi" denomination, it has a nice abbreviation too: "sat", and already widely, spontaneously used among the crypto community. 
"bits" place in the decimals/factor brings more confusion!
8081 2018-01-09 15:04:06 $BTC can now go two ways, so keep a close eye.

It looks like it's gonna bounce.
- Good volume came in there.
- RSI turned up on 1h, 30m and 15m.

If we close the 1h above 14.8k I suspect a run.

ただ、利率に関しては雲泥の差があります。
リスクがあったとしてもそれを上回るリターンが望めるのでみんなやってるんだと思います。
また、リスクについても個人ウォレットや取引所の分散により小さくしている人もいます。
なので仮想通貨はおすすめといえます。

8153 2018-01-09 14:59:32 $USD has done a lot more unspeakable things than any crypto. To me, crypto is a tool of the people to do the things we want to do - the way we want to do them. I think that's priceless.
8154 2018-01-09 14:59:28 Yes I'm aware. but they only accept crypto as payment. Many ICO's are now giving some kickbacks when payment methods appreciate excessively between pre-sale and launch.
8155 2018-01-09 14:59:26 You’re becoming less and less of an influence on the crypto community. So I really don’t think anyone cares. I’m sure admitting ur a junkie gets people to wanna know ur opinion that much more

8351 2018-01-09 14:46:04 The main problem is a file drawer problem, you can apply the same logic to an infinite group of possible predictors.

Only those who guess right, or pick a sufficiently predictable time frame go public.

The presence of public predictors indicates no crypto/physics breakthrough.

8371 2018-01-09 14:44:45 Je te conseil de lire les white papers des Cryptos et si ça t’intéresse investis dedans.. si tu veux faire de la spéculation Check le top 10 du @CoinMarketCap mais c’est pas mon truc
8372 2018-01-09 14:44:44 何ですか？
8373 2018-01-09 14:44:42 amazed you guys are still in business after a stunt like that lol. what a sham company, coinbase too. gave the whole crypto space a really bad rep after that shit.

8375 2018-01-09 14:44:34 I live in TX. Austin is great, but there's been a mad rush to it last few years. Living cost has sky rocketed. Traffic is absolutely terrible. But there is a lot if tech movements there. Love TX, but Austin is tough
8376 2018-01-09 14:44:29 You tell me? I invested 40k before summer, today's profit? 220 BTC only I got hacked two months ago from @coinpouchapp I will remember that day til I die...

8456 2018-01-09 14:38:11 Well Tron has kind of officially came up as a scam and XRB exploded XP at the binance contest ! Which is a good thing in a way cause, #XRB is actually an amazing tech/crypto that could revolutionize the way we exchange value  could you let me know why XP needs a coin ??
8457 2018-01-09 14:38:06 lol working for yourself is the best money, no doubt. But plenty of people have very good jobs they enjoy and “slave” for and do more than barely pay their bills. You took me saying ppl look at crypto graphs all day a little too serious bro lol

8484 2018-01-09 14:36:09 But a lot of people seem to be saying "XRP is not my use case, hence I shouldn't invest".

8496 2018-01-09 14:35:29 They are part of the EEA, so eth would be more likely their jam.
8497 2018-01-09 14:35:28 $SNM last ATH in OCtober was 5925 on #Binance still plenty of room to move up.
8498 2018-01-09 14:35:23 Actually a crypto currency would also do a lot and very easy to deploy and once it place could introduce coins alongside

8515 2018-01-09 14:34:07 I'll give you 5 fundamental truths about trading that count in any given market

1) Anything can happen

8516 2018-01-09 14:34:05 The amount of crypto alerts that have saved my butt that I received on my #apple watch when my phone was in a different room saved and made me money. It’s a game changer.
8517 2018-01-09 14:34:02 Teach me the ways of crypto
8518 2018-01-09 14:34:01 And finally when you ultimately want to cash out you reverse the process and transfer back to coinbase which will let you sell your crypto for USD.
8519 2018-01-09 14:33:57 Are you supporting the ABTC fork?
8520 2018-01-09 14:33:56 グラボに桜チップのせておいて
8521 2018-01-09 14:33:55 @VentureCoinist heard you talking WAN on the crypto street podcast. Do you have a specific reason for preferring WAN over coins that have a similar purpose like ICON? Also why will people use WAN when things like atomic swaps can be implemented w/o it?  Appreciate your insight!
8522 2018-01-09 14:33:35 Ripple have listened to what people want, that is the point. The market they are targeting is cross-border payments -- financial institutions, global companies, etc. and those companies want a scalable, secure system first. The issue of decentralised trust matters less to them.

8524 2018-01-09 14:33:25 Thanks. I no longer trust trx and have been selling it off. Making fat stacks though.
8525 2018-01-09 14:33:23 IF YOU'RE NOT BUYING UP THIS CRYPTO RIGHT NOW SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU. FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SOLD EVERYTHING WHEN THE MARKET WENT DOWN, THANKS. IM A CRYPTO MILLIONAIRE NOW AND NEWS WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE MARKET IS ABOUT TO SPIKE TO 1,000,000,000,000 BY MARCH. 
8526 2018-01-09 14:33:20 I think that the SEC going after "Scam Coins" & Fraud is a great thing for the crypto market & investors. Although I also think it's funny that they issued a "dire warning" about cryptos being subject to manipulation when that's exactly what happens in our traditional stk mrkt!

8533 2018-01-09 14:32:56 It's interesting that investment vehicles are the ONLY things people want to buy when they are going up in price, and then sell when they are getting cheaper. You don't wait to buy a loaf of bread, or a new car, when it's getting more expensive. Why is #Crypto different?

8537 2018-01-09 14:32:35 I guess it's more about warning people! There are so many newbies in this crypto game. Hopefully some of them got it!
8538 2018-01-09 14:32:29 How long do these weak ppl need to make money? They keep selling for 2-3 cent gains n doing it for hours. Doesn’t it make more sense to just let it go up 20 cents then sell 1 time and prolly make more money?

8554 2018-01-09 14:31:34 Focus on the development please. And Congrats! I am a huge Crypto currency sceptic; that being said, I bet on Utrust for one reason: Despite some challenges, they have the basis to develop a platform that could bring all the CryptoCurrencies & Token ecosystem in real economy.
8555 2018-01-09 14:31:34 Remember when the price of gold shot up, we had all these mining shows? Where's my crypto shows with dramatic GPU burnouts and Monero rigs chasing the almighty bitcoin?
8556 2018-01-09 14:31:33 Good work looking out for the community. Though people should be very careful, between excitement and lack of attention to detail there can be hacks.

8562 2018-01-09 14:30:52 Just #HODL if you’re not a well experienced trader. Market will rebound. #crypto #cryptoworld

8576 2018-01-09 14:30:06 Ja, da hast du wahrscheinlich Recht.

8577 2018-01-09 14:30:05 Only the ones who wish to get spoon fed will be upset.  Maybe if we would study our charts with his heads up to invest, you would not get upset. Study your book on #elliot wave principles

8644 2018-01-09 14:25:18 Bitcoin itself is simply the avatar for crypto. In that I do think there is *some* value, but as a store of value, as a means of transmission, as a decentralized peer-to-peer network, it has many drawbacks. But the familiarity it carries is powerful.

All I'm saying is these behemoths of crypto community need to act like behemoths and not like some random innovators with human errors! It's as simple as that!
8662 2018-01-09 14:24:09 Why am I all of a sudden following all of these Crypto Currency pages? Bye.
8663 2018-01-09 14:24:03 $STRAT for the win bro
8664 2018-01-09 14:24:02 Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi’s Bitcoin. Hijackers don’t get to redefine the plane’s original destination.

8666 2018-01-09 14:23:59 They've done this before -- just a bunch of conspiracy theorists throwing FUD at other teams. How is EthereumBlue even making crypto safer when all they do is post unprofessionally delivered FUD on social media platforms? And this is what @Altcoinbuzzio pumps on their YT chan??
8667 2018-01-09 14:23:59 Would you say investing 15-20 dollars in crypto is profitable? If so which currencies?
8668 2018-01-09 14:23:57 I use Nvidia not AMD sorry

8675 2018-01-09 14:23:32 wow zac thanks! not just a crypto currency king and a pretty face after all
8676 2018-01-09 14:23:31 日本語だと法律や税金なんかでも仮想通貨という言い方になっているけど、英語だとCryptocurrencyが新聞なんかでも一般的だよね。cryptoはencrypt（暗号化）から来てるから、やはり暗号通貨が正しい訳だと思っている。仮想通貨取引してますって言うより暗号通貨って言った方がかっこいいしね。

8680 2018-01-09 14:23:04 True, they obviously have prices processes in place. The difference being that international transfer of fiat is made almost immediately with crypto. The current banking processes are tedious and time consuming.
8681 2018-01-09 14:23:02 Yeah, I'd like screenshots as well!
8682 2018-01-09 14:22:57 Nope, i am assuming a lil crypto kickback for each referral though.  Not a bad deal.  This registration pause is slowing the market down. Probably not a bad thing.

8684 2018-01-09 14:22:47 You're missing the point. If $SUB includes a native dApp platform, it will basically be a built-in ETH or NEO, which on their own are valued at billions of dollars. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm stoked for $SUB, but this could be a no-shit game changer in the #crypto world.

8687 2018-01-09 14:22:36 Lmao that’s why everyone moving to crypto currency bruh
8688 2018-01-09 14:22:32 Wot ever dude, ripple is not for me end off and people who follow crypto currencies for the rite reasons and believes will do the same unless ripple changes and once that done that will make ripple  but instead of doing that and gaining more customers.....
8689 2018-01-09 14:22:26 ノアコイン的なのは中国でもあるんだね
8690 2018-01-09 14:22:19 Not the same now is true but Bitcoin Cash’s chain extends back to the Bitcoin genesis node and it is electronic cash as Satoshi intended.
8691 2018-01-09 14:22:00 Yes we should have not left it on the exchange. Bittrex can take as long as they want apparently. I am also still waiting. Maybe by the time we get it it will be worth more than $1. I will be trading my $ignis the moment I receive it.
8692 2018-01-09 14:22:00 It was first, so barrier to entry is beating that "first to market." Bitcoin's utility is DEFINITELY up for debate. Crypto (as a general class) definitely has utility--and that utility is perhaps best described as ledger-based, trustless accounting.
8693 2018-01-09 14:21:48 Can't wait till I can buy weed w crypto currency
8694 2018-01-09 14:21:47 The replies to this tweet are the exact reason why Crypto continues to be fringe, we should be hopeful that some saw hands in the air and decided to research. To the Hodlers, if we cannot get the mainstream to buy, in the end it will all be worthless.

8716 2018-01-09 14:20:13 The idea "But if I simply give it to them, they will not do what *I want them to do with it!" dovetails nicely with the crypto-frat-house battle cry"Cryptocurrencies will take away power from evil central banks trying to control what we do with our money!" Coincidence, surely...
8717 2018-01-09 14:20:11 Doing great and you? As my teenage son says... crypto really hopping! Just dabble in ripple myself.

8740 2018-01-09 14:18:26 DLT and ‘Distributed’ should be banished from the crypto lexicon. True crypto is decentralized not distributed. Distributed implies control over distribution.

8788 2018-01-09 14:15:05 Sad but true..
8789 2018-01-09 14:15:05 Also, if you’re new make sure your identity is somewhat anonymous. Who knows how this crypto game will turn out and you don’t want to be known as the guy holding all of this bags of coins that were worth pennies a year ago and now are worth thousands of dollars
8790 2018-01-09 14:15:02 this is not religious standpoint Keneth, it is pure FACT. Empirical evidence is not something that we can discuss. But will they coexist in the crypto world? Probably will up to certain point in time, which is fine let there be coins as many as anyone wants
8791 2018-01-09 14:14:55 And that's why it's hard to be in a bubble , since BTC dips over 40% 7 times in 1 year...

8815 2018-01-09 14:12:24 Unfortunately crypto currency doesn't come in handy in a supermarket, if you can afford to play about with real currency then fair play
8816 2018-01-09 14:12:23 @krakenfx is horrible..everyday..jeeeezzz...809: Exchange API is unavailable
What it means: The exchange’s API is down. This rarely happens.
What you can do: Wait and try again. #RarelyHappens ??? yeah right!

8818 2018-01-09 14:12:20 You'll hear developers say "Ugh, all these people making money off of crypto don't really know how it works" but you won't hear the same developers saying "Ugh, all the customers using my SaaS product to improve their lives don't even know how to code"

8822 2018-01-09 14:11:40 a bit late to fill your bags.
8823 2018-01-09 14:11:32 $IOC is a gem in cryptoland. Considering the chart we are at “hope” but considering the tech and what’s coming there’s no doubt that we’ll have a winner here. Reminds me of $eth back in 2015... I’m so ready to HODL for the win
8824 2018-01-09 14:11:23 $UTK looking juicy

8828 2018-01-09 14:11:07 $XRP.X lol @ all the anti bank “ethical” crypto airheads. because surely you’re in crypto for anything other than money.
8829 2018-01-09 14:11:05 Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, has retracted his “Bitcoin is a fraud” stance.

I know MANY people who saw his initial words as the crux for staying out of the crypto game. It makes sense he still doesn’t like Bitcoin though, as it’s a TOTAL conflict of interest for his company

Storing medical data, managing power grids and distrubution aid is how blockchain is being used. Its not "BTC" its "crypto" and "blockchain. He needs to learn technology before talking about it..
8840 2018-01-09 14:10:05 @justinsuntron I just wanted to say thank you for all your hard work on TRON. I'm currently struggling on unemployment selling stuff on eBay n etsy and turning my profits into investments on crypto. IF you're gonna invest your last penny why not invest in the BEST!

8847 2018-01-09 14:09:45 talihsiz bir uygulama adı seçimi olmuş. crypto paranın bu kadar populer olduğu bir zamanda ripple = $xrp olarak algılanacaktır.
8848 2018-01-09 14:09:38 Bitcoin was mean to be a currency. Not a crypto commodity. Which means it was meant for all transactions. Not just the expensive ones for the rich.
8849 2018-01-09 14:09:31 No problem, man! I freaked out a little bit myself. That's the first running I do when my Xbox messes up. I tried it, and it worked. So I figured I'd pass it on to other people who were having the same issue!
8850 2018-01-09 14:09:31 So clarify that and don' t pump fake news. Cause xRapid sure shouldn' t have an effect on the ripple coin.
Ripple is a scam, the big banks will be pushing with their clients money,in order to slow down Btc and other real crypto coins,who s first aim is exactly to get rid of banks

8854 2018-01-09 14:09:07 I think that is probably a pretty fair statement. I think I'm done with new ICO's. If not it would have to be something incredible. At this point too many weak hands know about ICO's & they just want to dump for a quick 10x, then i end up getting screwed out of my 100x investment

8884 2018-01-09 14:07:41 I don't know about yall but BTC is the best crypto out there. We have figured out an off-chain solution to the scaling issue - we started to mail each other paper wallets and USBs as this is currently the cheapest way to send BTC. Sometimes I use PayPal and Western Union instead.
8885 2018-01-09 14:07:38 送金する際にPoWが必要というだけで、そのためにスマホでも可能にするという意味なら、まぁわかるかなーというところです。
単純なマイニングという意味ではわざわざスマホにこだわる理由はないはずなので、詳細が公開されないと現状なんともですねー。

8923 2018-01-09 14:05:02 Some musings on Coinbase: 

Coinbase seems to be responsible for onboarding most of the western world into crypto. It might be embarrassing for them when they adopt segwit and it highlights just how much congestion they are responsible for on the blockchain

8953 2018-01-09 14:03:32 The Bcash chain is invalid to nodes that ran on the bitcoin network, before and after Aug 1. They are not the same. Bcash is a social attack on bitcoin users, not just a few 1000 devs.

8969 2018-01-09 14:02:42 I haven’t looked at BNT so I couldn’t help you with that, sorry! But if you’ve made decent gains and think there’s more potential upside that can be made by switching coins instead of holding, go for it

8971 2018-01-09 14:02:32 Your using your Crypto not just hodling, just what it was meant for! Enjoy your gains and pleasures!

今年から仮想通貨に手を出しました。イーサが10万突破したとこで、インしました。草コインは上場が固そうなXPを買ってます。
追加の質問ですが、XPは上場で売り抜いた方がいいでしょうか？
8973 2018-01-09 14:02:22 My transaction is still stick in sending.  Transaction ID: d48cc6c3fcf5 Please fix quickly
8974 2018-01-09 14:02:18 Like I said weeks ago. No banks are going to use #Ripple #XRP. Banks are looking for a stable crypto where the owners do not own 60% of the coins. The owners of #Ripple can pull the plug on this at any minute selling off billions of premined coins.
8975 2018-01-09 14:02:15 I agree, it was huge for me and that 1 pick didnt catch anyone up to the insiders, so they shouldnt complain. You are #1 for me on Crypto Guidance!! Thanks George!

Back to the bar?
8978 2018-01-09 14:01:53 Nah bro.. you’re just learning.. stick with it, and as I told @TylerOwhoa last night.. fuck investing in crypto to make money, learn @Hyperledger and smart contracts. None of these crypto experts know a fucking thing about what this stuff actually does.. it’s just tradable lol
8979 2018-01-09 14:01:51 The bubble hasnt burst for @Ripple ...Im sick of hearing this today!! I was excpecting the sharp drop off, after such huge gains over the past few weeks its to be expected!!! My advice is to try and jugde when this drop is to bottom out..and then buy buy buy #ripple #xrp #crypto

8982 2018-01-09 14:01:40 Due to high bitcoin transaction fees, payout for 0.01 BTC has an irregular schedule. You will be paid when blockchain conditions allow the payments with reasonable TX fees.

We just processed 0.01 payout today.
8983 2018-01-09 14:01:40 Do you know what it means, 0.1 with this huge supply will take $Dime to Rank#4, Come on dont misguide new ones joining the crypto world.

8986 2018-01-09 14:01:30 Yeah this is wrong. Please don’t spread wrong information out. Then that gets everyone in a panic when it doesn’t come out, even though in Justin’s announcements it clearly states that announcement is on the 14th. Do more research before you spread info you n ow nothing about.
8987 2018-01-09 14:01:18 ウハウハですなあついですね、これは。
8988 2018-01-09 14:01:11 I'm speaking to more of a long term horizon.  What I've learned in crypto is holding delivers better returns then daily trading.  This thing will reach $5 in 2018.

8990 2018-01-09 14:01:05 which coin graph is this?
8991 2018-01-09 14:01:01 That network is only backed by speculators at the moment..  once crypto gets more adopted as an actual payment system and doesn't fluctuate in value by thousands of $ everyday, more people will feel comfortable, but for now it's pure speculation
8992 2018-01-09 14:00:57 @PacCoinDEVs  I have read about paccoin, paccoin token supply will reduce 3 T 2 billion then how you will compensate existing coin holder. i have bought 100K paccoin  at 1 satoshi price then what will be total token and price per token tell me. #paccoin #crypto
8993 2018-01-09 14:00:57 'would presumably grow over time' is pretty key delusion in the crypto fantasy.

8999 2018-01-09 14:00:32 One of the special features of reddcoin is that this crypto coin makes it possible to facilitate the use of virtual currencies via social networks. The hope is that this cryptomunt particularly appeals to young people, since they are most reluctant on digital social networks.

Great, you made tremendous ROI. But don’t try to tell me you’re some crypto enthusiast when your largest position is in XRP, you just continue to support the central banks. 

Plenty of opportunities to make Big ROI & have fundamentals

9009 2018-01-09 13:59:38 Does anyone over @Poloniex respond to support tickets?  I have had a ticket open for 5 days now and not a single response.  You've taken my crypto currency.  Put it back.

9011 2018-01-09 13:59:32 Cheers guys, will do that instead.
9012 2018-01-09 13:59:25 1/ if you're looking at crypto prices and see they're "down", remember that @CoinMarketCap removed for Korean exchanges from their price indices due to consistent premiums.

9044 2018-01-09 13:57:39 Many of the big names in crypto use BTC as their base currency and trade with a view of building that. Anyone out there basing on Eth? So much upside both short and log term and paired with fiat

9048 2018-01-09 13:57:18 Bitcoin was once called a crypto currency. It can no longer be called that. Since currencies were meant to be USED. It was also called peer to peer. It is now just to peer then hodl. Then some day when the price is high sell bitcoin for fiat and buy lambo. Not original vision.

9056 2018-01-09 13:56:44 There is no need to believe in any conspiracy. Yes, Markets are un-manipulated. Continue to HODL...but dont sell at 1K...because that is where Gold bugs did when gold was REKT. Good luck.

9143 2018-01-09 13:50:25 Dear #Bitcoin and #Crypto,  Thank you.   You made me ask the question “What is money?”  And ever since asking that question I have asked millions more. The more I learn, the more questions I have.   I’ve become more curious about everything in the world.   So thank you.
9144 2018-01-09 13:50:25 I am. Just kidding. I wouldn't bc it's issued by Venezuela. Great lessn for new crypto investors, tho: centralized coin issued by a gov't or any controlled institution is the same thing as a bolivar, a USD, a yuan. Except the issuer can now totally spy on every transaction.

Rule number 1:  Crypto is patience.
9183 2018-01-09 13:47:24 I was impressed that fibs were holding up the higher lows; now I notice that it was a simple trendline too (240 min)

I don't understand how any of these crypto have any value whatsoever
9184 2018-01-09 13:47:20 HODL is a crypto term used to define your position on a digital asset. -

“What are you going to do with your $XLM? 

HODL!”
9185 2018-01-09 13:47:19 3. Similarly to certain sensations that I've experienced watching and investing in the crypto space I see euphoric emotional investments payout when a currency "pumps". Granted there is a fiscal component akin to hitting at the casino but the difference is the underlying "belief"

9206 2018-01-09 13:45:38 COMSAのスキームは確かに素晴らしい。しかし、今の日本は金融庁の厳しい認可がおりないとICO出来ない。優秀なコンサル入れても申請から最低半年かかる。今の高評価とサービス規模がうまくリンクすれば良いのだが…。

9216 2018-01-09 13:44:38 Yes - he talked it down from 4K to 3k, so he made 17k profit vs 16k when is rider to its ATH. Are all Bitcoin freaks paranoid and believe in conspiracy??
9217 2018-01-09 13:44:34 what are you talking about? Its a regular progress announcement. I think you people got spoiled with the hype announcments in crypto world
9218 2018-01-09 13:44:30 What about crypto doggies slowing down the network?
9219 2018-01-09 13:44:29 That said, another dimension of this has to do with the potential impact that banning crypto could have on a country. Given that all countries don’t work together, and don’t seem capable of doing so, there are real repercussions for countries who miss out.

9261 2018-01-09 13:39:57 Please stop. There is something too "casino jackpot" about this type of contest. Before we know it we will only be able to play crypto in #LasVegas
9262 2018-01-09 13:39:56 are u participating?
9263 2018-01-09 13:39:51 hahaha you invest on crypto currencies for intrinsic value? you must be out of your god damn mind. 
9264 2018-01-09 13:39:51 adage goes that: 'A rising tide lifts all boats,' and the same goes for a falling one. With Bitcoin still being the biggest boat in the bay, it makes sense that should an issue affect it and its price, other coins in the crypto market will also feel the effect.

9271 2018-01-09 13:39:25 Wow! I love crypto right now! #Stanford
9272 2018-01-09 13:39:22 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。

9275 2018-01-09 13:39:04 @realDonaldTrump Jamie needs to prepare himself & JPM for the future. Fed is dead. Fiat currency an icon of the past. Board rooms passé. Decisions real time, instantaneous, integrated, transparent. Cyber & Crypto developing. Dimons become dinosaurs.

9278 2018-01-09 13:38:46 When was it used for a medium of exchange? All of crypto is currently way to volitile to be a medium of exchange.

9287 2018-01-09 13:38:27 Thank you for the insight.
9288 2018-01-09 13:38:19 If only we - early crypto adopters - could massively invest in our champion #Bitcoin, instead of:
-attacking it
-trading joke/shit-coins
-developing an endless ocean of alt-coins with zero to little added value
-spreading #FUD
Then, we could really change the World for the better
9289 2018-01-09 13:38:14 Crypto always looks enticing but I don't know If I'm ready to jump into that game just yet.

9296 2018-01-09 13:37:21 Look at smart crypto platofms, such as $@EthereumNetw, $NEO , $QTUM... Which growth they had... The next one which is coming live soon is $tezos. Keep eyez on it..

9298 2018-01-09 13:37:15 Honestly I think they never intended to launch initially. Somehow they got so much hype that they realized much more money could be made so they started the "work" as an after thought. That's was my opinion in oct 2017 n even now.

9302 2018-01-09 13:36:54 @FinMinIndia dear FM, I made profit from selling crypto currencies and wondering how to account this in my tax preparation for FY 2016-17. Please advice @arunjaitley @IncomeTaxIndia
9303 2018-01-09 13:36:53 Every mistake is an opportunity and an obligation to do something different, something better. Less than ideal trading becomes a trigger to work on your ideal self #Crypto #forex #stocks

9319 2018-01-09 13:35:43 10k followers... What an insane few months! Crypto is a serious life changer.

Met some great friends, and now I owe a few beers to a hell of a lot of people, impossible to tag you all, but you know who you are.  Looking forward to the craziness to come this year! Cheers guys

9328 2018-01-09 13:34:51 You spend a lot of time and energy bashing/hating crypto. I have no skin in the game but don’t see the upside of wasting so much energy. Let people do as they please, no?
9329 2018-01-09 13:34:49 Don't invest today what you can't afford to lose tomorrow - and do your research on the currency you're looking to purchase. 
Most have white papers which highlight their purpose and tech too. #crypto
9330 2018-01-09 13:34:48 Person who i tried to get into $crypto months ago but wouldn't: "So, hows all your coins doin'? Pretty good i bet huh?"

9334 2018-01-09 13:34:41 don't have verification on bittrex so I was forced to sell after delist dump. Once I'm verified that's the last time I'll use bittrex.
9335 2018-01-09 13:34:38 数ヶ月先、それより先をイメージしたらリップル持ってた方がいい気がしてきた。

9336 2018-01-09 13:34:37 It is not about how much you earn in a year is about Decentralization, are U confident to invest on #XRP, the company own the 60% of the Token.
I Did invest and every single time Wen the price gone up just a couple of minutes after dropped as an Stone. Internal Benefits? Sure...

9344 2018-01-09 13:34:06 仕手は怖くて手がなかなか出せません。少額かけて原資抜いて上がればラッキーの気持ちです。
大きく資金を伸ばすなら仕手でしょうが自分は手堅く大きくしか絶対にかけられないので少額で楽しんでいます
9345 2018-01-09 13:34:03 Keep in mind the total crypto market cap at $800 billion is just 0.3% of the $215 trillion in total assets globally. There is still ample room for this market to grow as more investors open accounts. #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency
9346 2018-01-09 13:34:01 Source?

9348 2018-01-09 13:33:28 Attention le serveur DNS de MyEtherWallet à été hacké. Évitez de l'utiliser pour le moment. Hier soir, impossible de transférer mes ETH. Heureusement que j'ai mes clés privée, car j'ai pu grâce à elles, transférer mes ETH. On voit la force des crypto dans ces moments !
9349 2018-01-09 13:33:23 One post I read hoped for crypto regulation so that people would be forced to use their coin since they believe regulators are OK with them.  People want a chance to participate in a financial system they can win at that is why this crypto thing has taken off. They don't get it.

9353 2018-01-09 13:33:09 気になるのはスマホによるマイニングっていうのがどうなんだろう。
ETH掘り続けてるけど大して掘れないし、TRFのマイニング熱そうなら切り替えてみても、とも思ったんだけれど…うーん？
普通にPCで掘らせてほしい感じが否めないｗ
いずれにせよICO終了後に公開されていくようなので楽しみが増えた！

9366 2018-01-09 13:32:22 I'm resigned to the fact that i'll never be able to answer the question "What is bitcoin", but I am learning alot about currency markets, and crypto markets specifically. It's fun.
9367 2018-01-09 13:32:20 a degree is irrelevant.  Besides, Justin has a crypto background he worked for ripple in China. He was the chief representative. Justin Sun also founded Peiwo, a successful app in China. So, I prefer a person with real-life experience (CEO of a co) than a dinky MIT graduate.

9404 2018-01-09 13:29:33 Let‘s do it, been waiting for this thing to go off- amazing project
9405 2018-01-09 13:29:23 Japanese conglomerate DMM will launch a new crypto-metabase on January 10th...
9406 2018-01-09 13:29:10 ありがとうございます。安定の半分利確して様子見ています。
9407 2018-01-09 13:29:07 Don't trust me with crypto recommendations... but $BNTY seems really cool. Very curious to see how this turns out #BNTY
9408 2018-01-09 13:28:57 I was browsing charts the other week.  Saw a complete flatliner start to finish. The Icelandic national crypto $AUR I had to grab some for fun.  Now 2x
9409 2018-01-09 13:28:48 And this little episode proves a suspicion I've always had , most traders that are way wayyy too invested in crypto don't know how to trade other normal asset classes
9410 2018-01-09 13:28:47 
9411 2018-01-09 13:28:47 Nobody knows, and anybody who tells you they do is lying to you.
9412 2018-01-09 13:28:46 $TRF は話題のDAG使用ってだけでもホイホイ来る人居そうだし、ICO割れは考えにくそう。
弊社のJPYマイニング報酬配当日も間に合うし、もうちょっと入れたいなー。
$ADK の買い増しは割りともう諦めムードで、持ってる分はこのまま長期ホールド。

9421 2018-01-09 13:28:00 Dogecoin marketcap as the barometer for the frothiness of the crypto assets market. Plausible
9422 2018-01-09 13:27:53 Crypto is definitely in a bubble, but that doesn't shift long-term trends. You can have a bubble and crash in 2-3 yrs but still have a long-term shift in that direction over 60-100 yrs.

This totally changes equity financing IMO.
9423 2018-01-09 13:27:47 When's the final date when $btcd will no longer be supported? What will happen to the market cap, price... of $kmd?

9427 2018-01-09 13:27:32 I stopped playing videogames since i found $crypto. Feels sad to lose that part of me. Videogames was my passion before crypto. Now its kinda impossible to me to focus on something not related to crypto. Fml. I tried fortnite the other day. Not bad.
9428 2018-01-09 13:27:26 A good bag you got.

9435 2018-01-09 13:26:54 I’m not 100% sold on this. I think crypto is in somewhat of a bubble. Certainly a future but this bubble will eventually pop short term. Way too much BS out there At the moment.

9449 2018-01-09 13:25:42 Worldwide crypto currency valuation exceeds half a trillion dollars and yet it seems to be the fidget spinner of the investor class and MSM. No doubt they'll expect a bailout in 2018 when things gets ugly, wholly @ the expense of the people who didn't participate in this "market"

Phoreという通貨がCryptopiaに BTC, LTC, doge建てであるのですが、どうやらLTC建てのみがそちらのアプリに反映されているようです。

9483 2018-01-09 13:22:08 Very interesting! The idea that anyone can fulfill the role of banks by issuing loans (how money is created today) is underexplored in crypto today IMO. CC @niran 

That said I found the Wikipedia article to be pretty one-sided with no references 
9484 2018-01-09 13:22:03 So the Bitcoin bubble is about to pop because it's not actually a store of value... because it's core value proposition is already commoditized in the world of crypto. But the market will come roaring back thanks to ETH and other digital assets
9485 2018-01-09 13:22:03 Its all about the #blockchain which isn't married to the crypto scene which many believe

9506 2018-01-09 13:19:16 The wierd place of 50% blockchain-based projects is that they dont need blockchain for a desired functionality. Beware of those. #crypto
9507 2018-01-09 13:19:02 ETC shitcoin with big volume but without any movers. It made only +40% drom the bottom, while alts made +300%
9508 2018-01-09 13:18:59 The value of anything is the amount of time and effort (your life) you are willing to spend in order to acquire or produced it. (Productivity) Money is a representation of that productivity. Fiat money has a direct relationship with productivity. Crypto does not...yet.
9509 2018-01-09 13:18:56 I can’t wait to see how the crypto-socialists feel about paying capital gain taxes...
9510 2018-01-09 13:18:51 @DiaryofaMadeMan>I am new in crypto, and find you from another person inn crypto. Very happy to learn from you!
9511 2018-01-09 13:18:51 You might think one of those, but the truth is no one actually knows. That's why it's wise. It's also highly individual. If you already have some level of wealth, you may want to hold. If crypto has suddenly put you in a place of much wealth but all on paper, maybe sell a little.
9512 2018-01-09 13:18:45 #FX My First use of #Crypto brokers (exchanges) - Rapacious, Usurious, Inefficient. If I'd been transacting $500,000, I would've lost $100,000 in broker margin & fees.

9515 2018-01-09 13:18:36 Banks have their ways.

The point is we already have a centralized method of transfer from A to B. The aim is to have a decentralized one. And ripple I'm sorry to say is owned and controlled in a centralized manner. Not to say it won't do well. It just defeats the point of crypto
9516 2018-01-09 13:18:35 The volume is low on a lot of the coins

9553 2018-01-09 13:14:57 I can see XRB is not well represented within the Asian community. Someone care to translate that it's: instant, feeless and no mining required? Also this is the first crypto I see getting adopted as payment method organically by shop owners. The team did virtually no marketing!
9554 2018-01-09 13:14:53 When I talk about crypto currency, I sound like those non-music related people talking about autotune.

9560 2018-01-09 13:14:26 @hitbtc This is my 2nd twee to you guys. It has been more than 36 hrs since my ETH withdrawal and I have still not received my ETH nor do I know where it is stuck. If I put my transaction ID in etherscan, it says wrong ID. What is happening?!
9561 2018-01-09 13:14:14 #Tron #trx Riddle me this - how did Tron, when little known, accumulate 6 B $ in a day, but now it’s the most spoken of crypto on Twitter, and it’s falling down a hill? Are all investors long, or is the price reliant on a few speculative ?
9562 2018-01-09 13:14:13 Well a lot of these projects only started in the last couple of months so now I have alert set on bitcoin talk forum - Altcoin Announcements

9699 2018-01-09 13:01:48 The Twitt doesn’t say that. It is a court denying the prosecution. Not open to crypto
9700 2018-01-09 13:01:43 I’m curious about the context of the statement. He doesn’t say it’s not a fraud, just that he “regrets calling it a fraud.”

Could be just sick of the crypto clan assaulting him online.

9717 2018-01-09 13:00:34 @ceepo if you have in cryptos more then 6 month worth of paychecks it's worth it.  No you cant put every crypto on it.

9719 2018-01-09 13:00:29 Not entirely true. ATO will treat it like income if you can prove it was made that way. 

I.e if you ‘invested’ in crypto and made money = capital gains

If you accept Crypto as payment/cash - normal tax you would pay same as cash.

9730 2018-01-09 12:59:54 Last year the opskins sold over $40b worth of skins. In the next 12 months if that happens again thru wax that’s the price.  And it will because the gamers know about crypto and they will spend more on their passion cause now they will have the ability to make those money
9731 2018-01-09 12:59:50 As #Crypto trading matures the variance between absolute and relative skill will increase. Excess returns will matter. For now so much new capital flooding in that everyone is beating traditional asset investment.

9841 2018-01-09 12:51:15 That's a fair point. At some point the floodgates will open. Nxt went from 3,000 to 13,000 before IGNIS. The ZCL current price is as close to buying money with minimal risk downside as you can get in crypto

9849 2018-01-09 12:50:22 after some googling... Filling in their forms. Wish me luck!
9850 2018-01-09 12:50:15 A good project that exists in the world of crypto and certainly!

9853 2018-01-09 12:50:09 仕事辞めたんですか？
9854 2018-01-09 12:50:02 I did exactly the same when they de listed bitshares and that paid off massively. 
9855 2018-01-09 12:49:51 残念！！当選した方おめでとうございます！！！
9856 2018-01-09 12:49:40 Of course banks will use XRP. And you better believe the banks CEOs are buying XRP for themselves. Yet I do believe it's not a true Crypto, it's still an excellent buy. The more banks promote using it, it will go higher. To me it's more like a stock than a crypto. STILL bullish!
9857 2018-01-09 12:49:37 You should be doing your home work investments, not me. But the answer was correct.
9858 2018-01-09 12:49:28 なんか今日は私のツイートに対して、堀江さんからリプライをいただき、朝山さんからリツイートしていただくという、なんとも光栄な１日でした。フォロワー数も１５０あまりで、つけあがるわけではないですが、おふざけの煽りツイートとかはもうやめようと思いました。くだらないツイートはします。

9861 2018-01-09 12:49:11 Yes , you are being a noob lol. But no worries, for etherdelta you have to add the token (finding its token address on etherscan) , and for hitbtc you must wait until the 20th! Also careful with ed, once you buy the tokens transfer them off of ed asap, and use meta mask
9862 2018-01-09 12:49:08 I use @RobinhoodApp for all my stock trading, but I just took a survey for them and it asked all about what if @RobinhoodApp had a crypto trading app. @Crypto_goat_ @CryptoKenobi

9868 2018-01-09 12:48:53 I even stopped gaming in favor of crypto.

9871 2018-01-09 12:48:33 Now that #WraithProtocol is released, the $xvg price will be decoupled from the software release and more tied to mass adoption.

9881 2018-01-09 12:47:48 Hello, @SpotifyCares. Thanks for the always amazing service and product that we find in @Spotify.

I'd like to leave a suggestion: what about supporting payment using well known crypto currencies? I'd suggest Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin.

Thanks and kudos 2 U all
9882 2018-01-09 12:47:41 Where did you enter? People panic about NXT because they complacently bought the NXT top like noobs, then it dumped around the snapshot. They didn't realize there is no free lunch in crypto and now project their grievance onto NXT fundamentals. NXT is fine, more than fine.
9883 2018-01-09 12:47:35 Ini Satoshinya crypto currency?

9889 2018-01-09 12:46:48 What if you had a cryptocurrency wallet on your phone with a link to your fiat bank account and some exchange, that automatically tops up any crypto you spend with the corresponing fiat value of the purchase, in the crypto you buyed with. #bitcoincash #adoption

9891 2018-01-09 12:46:34 @crypto_rand What do you think about @Bytecoin_BCN
9892 2018-01-09 12:46:29 I agree and sincerely have no doubt you are but you can have money and have integrity . There is nothing wrong with leveraging banks or the differing approaches to crypto to make or move money and doing it ethically and feeling good. They do it to us like any other business.
9893 2018-01-09 12:46:29 My prediction is they'll all support #XRP a centralised cryptocurrency run by bankers. Why does anything central even requires crypto baffles me!
9894 2018-01-09 12:46:27 On these chart readings, is there an estimated timeline on when these prices may be met ?
