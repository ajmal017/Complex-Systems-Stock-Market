47 2018-02-20 20:41:34 On 'Find me a Home' HAP Scheme, a couple are sanctioned for, €1,500 per month for a private rental property. That would service a mortgage. This neoliberal government are padding pockets of private people. Citizens are commodities. Sickening.

59 2018-02-20 19:29:00 Melt value is awful concept!  Aureii are maybe $320 metal value, tops; denarii about $1.85, full weight both. Irrelevant to fair pricing. Slabbing distorts cost of coins and wrecks tactile value.  I view low $ ancients as learning tools, not commodities like US market.
60 2018-02-20 19:25:30 Long term investment for me, riding the commodities cycles.
61 2018-02-20 19:22:56 I think commodities could play this role in general, perhaps. Rates up -> capacity fuelled by debt expansion down -> commodity prices up. It's possible at least.
62 2018-02-20 19:21:05 Leasing pandas from China fuels the market for captive pandas. If demand for these commodities decreases, then so will supply. And fewer will be held against their will in zoos. China should be preserving pandas in their natural habitat, not breeding them for captivity & profit.
63 2018-02-20 19:18:57 It's unsettling how many people deem arts and humanities as useless commodities.

82 2018-02-20 17:48:21 Granted. I think it is maybe time to take a step backwards. I'd really like the government to find away to let the farmers grow as much as they can without the commodities market crashing and use the excess to feed the poor. The food stamp/card program way over abused.

104 2018-02-20 16:23:33 Wise words Sara.......

Time is also tone of the few, ever diminishing commodities that can not be purchased, traded or sold.

And like anything with a dwindling supply, it increases in value exponentially with the less of it that there is.

106 2018-02-20 16:17:37 Tariffs vary depending on the goods.  To its shame the EU put low tariffs on raw commodities but high tariffs on manufactured goods.  This is a barrier against poor countries moving up the value chain to sell us more than raw materials at rock bottom prices.

238 2018-02-20 03:20:24 I could stomach these bailouts if the tradeoff was pipelines agreed to the West AND East. Brutal to see Quebec unsupportive of eastern pipelines, yet the sale of the commodities that would flow through those very pipelines is what fills the transfer payment bucket
239 2018-02-20 03:19:05 Where do they apply money is the key to scams. Commodities import/export is one key area to check?
240 2018-02-20 03:14:54 El cableado es carísimo! Pensá cuánto venís pagando de internet, cable visión y teléfono celular , y también pensá que esos servicios no requieren insumos que sean commodities que cotizan a precio U$S porque es un recurso escaso en todo el mundo. Y acá no se invirtió en eso.
241 2018-02-20 03:10:27 Wedding season in India is a harassment. 

1. Crazy Traffic all the time
2. Skyrocketed prices of commodities
3. Everything is out of stock
4. Crazy noise pollution
5. No availability of train tickets
6. All time high airfares 
And then
7. Beta tum shaadi kab karaoge

242 2018-02-20 03:08:17 If someone has access to a box of commodities, take a picture of it and send to your Congressman.
243 2018-02-20 03:02:12 Absolutely true. Besides education, bottom line is that men in general need to do better. Too many look at women as commodities or objects rather than an individual so crossing the line becomes acceptable in their minds.

245 2018-02-20 02:50:24 Do you think there is not one black market?  It's not a place, you know that right?  Black market means "an illegal traffic or trade in officially controlled or scarce commodities"
246 2018-02-20 02:34:18 if the burden of proof and presumption of harm that is applied to cannabis was a uniform standard in public heath policy strategies, then the vast array of herbal/dietary supplement commodities would be criminally prohibited .An exceptionalism entrenched by decades of prohibition
247 2018-02-20 02:30:43 Buying commodities (inputs) from Emerging Market countries and selling high value finished goods to the wealthy countries?
248 2018-02-20 02:29:29 unrepentant settlers on native land who have....... employed every "legal" means conceivable, and deemed necessary, to continue to colonise, marginalise, stigmatise, demonise and brutalise indigenous peoples as forgettable, expendable, disposable commodities. @ShreeParadkaragree?
249 2018-02-20 02:29:28 I only wish that idols be treated as artists instead of commodities and that they be given some creative freedom to make music, not contribute to noise pollution & mediocrity.   #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY
250 2018-02-20 02:28:55 Yes, the cost of living played it's part at the election & the general talk in the market place was the soaring prices of essential commodities. Instead our politicians dwelt on topics that were greek to the public in the villages are the reason for the loss at the elections #lka
251 2018-02-20 02:27:15 The verdict comes as prosecutors prepare for other trials targeting manipulation in markets including currencies, commodities and mortgage-backed securities.

252 2018-02-20 02:25:07 Pero por lo menos fuiste a leer lo que son la commodities. Te recomiendo que aumentes tu nivel de información antes de aprender mientras te pelotudean, puede que sea mas sano.
253 2018-02-20 02:23:24 There's enough betting on the market to stay away from an extremely volatile commodities.

255 2018-02-20 02:17:23 ¿Sabes lo que son las commodities? Calculo que no, porque no repetirias eso como un pelotudo. En serio. Anda a leer y volvé.
256 2018-02-20 02:12:21 La inflación, simplemente subieron el Estado, desaprovecharon el mejor contexto global de la historia,tasas 0, commodities volando,Brasil volando. Y aún si países como Chile que hace 40 años eran 1/3 de nuestro personal cápita,hoy nos superan. Los datos me indican que no funciona
257 2018-02-20 02:12:19 Not sure about entire commodities, but at least it is for gold and silver
258 2018-02-20 02:11:36 Rs 10000 crore fraud in #NSEL was due to absence of commodities in FTIL/NSEL warehouse, against which NSEL had issued  contracts to investors, and taken their money.
259 2018-02-20 02:10:13 É o  commodities americano.
260 2018-02-20 02:09:00 So this would be bullish for commodities (because dollar printing would send people scurrying to put money in hard assets to defend against the inflation)?
261 2018-02-20 02:05:04 3224: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
262 2018-02-20 02:04:01 Listening to debate on interest rates for payday loans. Gov shouldn’t have a dog in the hunt; if party A wants to charge 40% interest and party B is willing to pay it, that’s called making a deal. Commodities must be transacted by participants, not Gov. @CharlesTrumpWV gets it.
263 2018-02-20 01:54:16 precious metals are not currencies, they are commodities. Limites ressources are the most important reason that it will never become a currency.
264 2018-02-20 01:51:20 अरे sir आराम कब करते हो, stocks then commodities then research & post.. Great going..good man too 
265 2018-02-20 01:47:55 Well they did before oblunder came along and destroyed anything and everything American, he could get his grubby paws on. Every month they handed out commodities to those that qualified. So yes they can if it's handed to the states to operate.
266 2018-02-20 01:06:54 Ha! ...and this my friend David @dynamicvol . He had to teach me commodities.

270 2018-02-20 00:40:32 Serious competition between states for services, money, goods, commodities or manpower will cause an unsustainable rise in the price of all of these resulting in loss of wealth for all sides. Do not fight between states of the same country, be wise, work together as part of whole
271 2018-02-20 00:38:49 Human life is the most valuable commodity.   Government buildings don't have valuable commodities, yet they are highly protected.  I beg to differ with this rationale.  Agree more mental health support is needed.  This is not all about gun control.  Evil will always find a way
272 2018-02-20 00:25:35 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
273 2018-02-20 00:22:00 Very.  When one examines weighted COT the trading pattern of WTI is anomalous to most other commodities.
274 2018-02-20 00:19:25 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
275 2018-02-20 00:02:10 #Vine was one of those rare commodities where everybody loved it unconditionally...and yet they yanked the carpet out from under us FAR too son...#RIPVine #WeStillMissYou
276 2018-02-20 00:00:13 The stock market has intrinsic value. Commodities have value. Businesses have hard assets with value. Balance sheets assess said value, and this accounting has an effect on stock prices.
