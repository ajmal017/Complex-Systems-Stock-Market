6 2018-02-22 23:21:24 Uh. Yeah. So commodities (literally every commodity) are always looking for new uses.  Thinking it's some subversive way to make people consume #dairy under the cloak of night is...I don't even know what to say to that. Plus ingredients are labeled so it's not hidden.
7 2018-02-22 23:11:48 Interesting to see our multi-factor multi-asset strategies shifting meaningfully toward inflation oriented assets, ie commodities, gold, TIPs, EAFE. Could be short lived, but definitely observing a state change.

34 2018-02-22 22:00:46 Id argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand whats going on  certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be.   John Burbank
35 2018-02-22 22:00:00 Dependía de las ideas de Kici o del crecimiento de la región, particularmente Brasil, y de los commodities?
Ojo no vaya a ser que lo más dinámico de las MOI sean las Hilux que Toyota produce con las ampliaciones de plantas previas a MM.
36 2018-02-22 21:46:35 Commodities will inflect higher in an rising rate environment. As long as commodity supply doesn’t break the positive feedback loop (which will not happen until later this year), prices are likely to trend higher. Met coal is the exception...Metal, Ag, Energy, Gold should do well
37 2018-02-22 21:37:04 @vector90 I would move from tech stocks to commodities if I were you.
38 2018-02-22 21:33:18 Isn’t that what’s he doing???  Don’t trust this commodities salesman
39 2018-02-22 21:32:28 Absolutely not. Any person would be happy and go out and purchase commodities before retiring for the night in front of the shrine to the holy market
40 2018-02-22 21:27:32 sin empatía son la gente que votó a Cristina habiendo dejado 30% de pobreza despues de las commodities mas altas de la historia argentina. 12 años gobernaron, 12 años donde los bolsones de pobreza solo crecieron.
41 2018-02-22 21:21:21 Also, “left on the shelf” is a hugely offensive term. Maybe, people who use it, perhaps think of themselves as commodities, the rest of us are humans.
42 2018-02-22 21:20:55 If it pulls out of both stocks and cryptos, where is it going? Commodities? Or are they tanking too?
43 2018-02-22 21:10:03 La tasa no pega sin crédito ni con bajo nivel de deuda. Los commodities pegan directamente y a través de las manufacturas industriales que de venden a países de la región con sus expo más concentradas.
44 2018-02-22 21:00:20 I mean that if a country or region does not grow sufficient food by and for the population they have a problem that isn't resolved by importing expensive or  "dumped" products from elsewhere where value is added to exported commodities.  Good for elite, not for the people!
45 2018-02-22 20:59:23 The word choice is revealing here. If ideas are commodities, then they are static things that can be "discovered" (or purchased). If ideas are discursive, evolving products of human imagination, then you might have to actually *think* about them.
46 2018-02-22 20:58:33 Jesus Christ. This country is fucking insane. "BRANDING"?
These CHILDREN are not COMMODITIES
47 2018-02-22 20:46:16 Also, if people really wanted to they could keep their savings in GBP. I can have my savings in USD, EUR or invest it in shares or commodities. We can do whatever we like with our own money in an indy Scotland.
48 2018-02-22 20:43:45 #Soybeans closed lower. Corn and wheat were higher. Livestock mixed. US #Dollar turned lower on talk US may be slow in raising rates.  This helped US stocks and most commodities today.

51 2018-02-22 20:35:47 Cold Storage report:
Beef up 2% from last month, down 7% from last year
Pork supplies up 16% from last month, up 8% from last year
Pork bellies up 13% from last month, up 219% from last year
52 2018-02-22 20:32:51 "You're creating the buying urge in a speculative commodities market." Sure thing Pete. Perhaps we can value children's lives like pork belly futures.
53 2018-02-22 20:32:43 Likely that the cost of corruption, leakage and inefficiency in kenya ends up being factored in pricing of commodities. Cost is electricity for instance says a lot.
54 2018-02-22 20:28:35 Digital commodity ≠ gold.

The intrinsic value of gold ≠ valuation of a digital commodity.

Digital commodities are not scarce. Deflation ≠ scarcity.
55 2018-02-22 20:22:45 pretty woke of him to dramatically demonstrate how mainstream diversity programs are about turning people of color into commodities
56 2018-02-22 20:21:26 They shouldn't be all classified as export 'commodities'. Rather as value chains with or w/o downstream value addition potential. So both food & cash crops should be put together & assessed based on a) competitiveness b) inclusivity c) value addition potential d) scale potential
57 2018-02-22 20:17:08 True, they are very different chains and ownership (#women?)  matters. However, #agrobiodiversity   and sufficient integration of food crops for local processing and markets is essential for food & nutrition security. Mere focus export commodities fuels deprivation and hunger.
58 2018-02-22 20:08:01 we are commodities
59 2018-02-22 20:05:51 Excited to hear #Seahawks are working on log term deal for Sheldon Richardson. Good 3-techs are rare commodities. Investing in D-line key to team philosophy.
60 2018-02-22 20:03:20 "How did America die?"

"We sold fear, hate, violence and turned people into commodities. We let them murder children in the schools and did nothing meaningful to stop them. We lost even the pretense of morality while we lied to ourselves about our greatness."
61 2018-02-22 20:00:18 Commodities are still handed out monthly to the elderly and low-income families in our county. I wouldn't call the processed cheese and oily peanut butter "some of the best ever eaten". I found them to be totally lacking in flavor.

64 2018-02-22 19:53:10 The hashtags for commodities such as #gold #silver during these #Olympics are working out great for our news stories! Maybe we can convince @Twitter to keep them. #TheProspectorNews #mining #investments #Commodities
65 2018-02-22 19:48:53 Longtime commodities analyst Dennis Gartman who produces the daily "Gartman Letter" revealed Wednesday he had taken a significant loss on his investment in embattled Colorado-based Riot Blockchain Inc. LOL so that’s what killed my $RIOT bet! If he’s out now... maybe we can rally?
66 2018-02-22 19:36:14 It's actually because people believe Democrats are coming for their guns.

70 2018-02-22 19:26:21 I never feel I have a privilege in any social arena. Intellectually, yes. As to my value as a person? No. We're all commodities in a commercial world. I grew up poor in a very rich community. I lived through a different sort of "racism." I understand being the other very well.

85 2018-02-22 18:03:17 Maintindihan ba ito ng ordinaryong working citizen ng bansa natin? For filipino consumers weaker peso means rising prices, mataas na presyo for oil/gasoline, food, commodities, and other goods and services that impact their cost of living.

92 2018-02-22 17:56:38 Scooter, socialism doesn’t mean state control. It means democracy at work. Instead of boards of directors and rich absentee shareholders, the companies would be owned by the employees. And things that aren’t commodities - healthcare, housing - would be provided for all.

113 2018-02-22 16:30:36 We all wish we could! Yes oilers, revenue making producers of commodities, undervalued, cash rich, asset rich, well run explorers in battery elements/commodities will all do well too
114 2018-02-22 16:23:36 Yes, I agree, it’s easy for people to be affected by the idea power and quid pro quo are buyable commodities with trump. Ie. Kushner dealings with China and green cards and space for rent. Definitely not ethical.

there are no jobs
farmers are in distress
industry is in doldrums
prices of all essential commodities have increased.

136 2018-02-22 14:50:48 You're right. We don't.
Part of it's conditioning. We've learned to base our opinions of commodities based upon those terms. Online services have validated this.
Part of it's societal. Sex has been marketed as a commodity for some time.
Most of it's that we're just boors.

The value is in the transformation of commodities to products.
139 2018-02-22 14:47:50 This is the Rees-Mogg argument, that the EU raises protectionist barriers resulting in higher food prices than WTO-tariff priced goods. While this is true for some commodities, such as sugar, it is not a robust argument.
140 2018-02-22 14:43:16 A bit of levity @Todd_Murphy1 but  for all those suggesting 'doom and gloom' but as you know, not so for the long game investor that respects market cycles and the future of commodities.

I would like to say early movement in the market is a 'Christmas Tree' but there is no red.
141 2018-02-22 14:41:09 Ok. Perhaps the Dutch Citizens resident in Britain who are integrated & are British tax payers would appreciate to be recognised and not as tradeable commodities that is.
If UK was actually a #Democracy Dutch Citizens would have had a vote in 2016. @The3Million #Remain wud'v won.
142 2018-02-22 14:39:04 Perishability is just another variable alongside weather. I think it's misleading to assume there is some base price for food commodities, a la Rees-Mogg cheap food argument. The WTO agricultural tariffs give some idea of the presence of state subsidisation.

147 2018-02-22 14:08:13 To be clear, I have no problem with an aggressive investor putting a portion of portfolio in a basket of cryptos - maybe 5-10%, like PE/VC, gold, commodities, real estate; but “all in on BTC” is foolish.

230 2018-02-22 05:50:29 La diferencia de británicos de los portugueses holandeses y españoles es que los británicos creaban demanda de sus productos implementando un comercio de trueque de commodities (opio de la india para comprar té chino)
231 2018-02-22 05:48:15 Refugee women suffer the most. Treated as commodities and sex toys. Indeed depressing.
232 2018-02-22 05:44:48 I don't mean to cherry pick the data set, but to describe the economy in the falling (rates, commodities) phase. And it's no coincidence that recession occurs with a lag following rate hike, then rates cut deeper...

234 2018-02-22 05:28:40 @SakinaKamwendo #AMLive When we consider the already high prices of bread, meat, milk, electricity ... basically most everyday commodities and essentials; the increase of #ZAT to 15% is just a legal way of more #StateLooting from the working class & poor #Budget2018 @SAfmRadio
235 2018-02-22 05:23:27 Correct bro, gollapudi garu movie lo cheppinattu "janalani ala unchadame correct ani politicians,manam ila bratikitene best ani janaalu fix aipoyaru" every single indian on an average looses willingly around 2rs per day on daily commodities..
236 2018-02-22 05:21:35 We’ll agree to disagree, IMO market cap is useless for assetts or commodities, your original post that tries to make it out to be a limit factor is either ignorance or purposeful FUD - peace out.
237 2018-02-22 05:20:06 Why does anyone think trump would be moved by the traumatized and emotional words of these child victims? His own children are commodities.

239 2018-02-22 04:52:55 sir they are singling out just oil but what about metals and other commodities all going up
240 2018-02-22 04:52:46 Politicians haven't known more than we do 4 a long time. These guys r just fund-raisers.They don't work for u.With few exceptions,they work 4 the lobbies that fund them & get them re-elected.They're commodities, but u guys can change that.Demand term limits for Congress.
241 2018-02-22 04:49:09 About 633,232 hectares (ha) of oil palm plantation and 59 mills have voluntarily obtained the Malaysia Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification as of January 2018, said Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Mah Siew Keong.
242 2018-02-22 04:45:17 Good point. I say metal detectors, with armed guard and bomb and gun powder sniffing dogs on the other side? Overkill? You bet. Our youth are invaluable commodities, worth more than gold and silver and we must protect them.
243 2018-02-22 04:31:09 Hey -  how does this replace / change the current Commodities program. Worth an explanation for those of us who don't know.  Seems like a lot of families accessing the Food Bank also were eligible for a 'pre-selected' range of products once (or maybe more) a month.  Thanks.
244 2018-02-22 04:27:28 Fed hikes Short Term Rates. $$ strengthens as foreign "hot money" inflows chase Yields. Drives down said Yields, at Long End. Countering Fed Policy. Lowers cost of imported commodities. See Crude Oil & Gold, both domestically & on global Markets. US Exports grow more Expensive.
245 2018-02-22 04:13:03 "I have this dream that there's this place I can be who I am
Without the threat of penalty or contempt for my stance
Sex and clothes, commodities, relationships, and debt
It seems as though each thing we do requires a precedent

3) petroleum;
2) drugs; &
1) the arms to protect them.

248 2018-02-22 03:39:51 Si ni me digas... con el tema precio de los Commodities una... y se está hablando de la peor sequía en 70 años... eso al interior lo hace percha
249 2018-02-22 03:38:28 Y menos del 5 también, creo que al 3,5 incluso, ahora el tema es el siguiente... no la pegamos eh, siempre  los zurdos son los que tienen los mejores precios de commodities y las menores tasas de interés... que lo pario
250 2018-02-22 03:33:15 Hard to get US regulatory clarity on #Bitcoin / #Blockchain / #cryptocurrency 
-SEC thinks they are securities
-CFTC thinks they are commodities
-FINCEN thinks it's money
-IRS taxes it as property
...and the FDA says "It taste like CHICKEN!"

252 2018-02-22 03:09:05 Market cap is the most arbitrary thing in the world, and its ten times worse for commodities and assets, its a simply multiplication of the spot price times the supply. It means virtually nothing for assetts and commodities.
253 2018-02-22 03:06:39 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc

256 2018-02-22 02:40:17 If you do not think that commodities are super currency sensitive right now...look at today..all you need...btw ...I talked about this on futures radio with @AnthonyCrudele 2 weeks ago

259 2018-02-22 02:17:54 Mas observamos o inverso. Ao agregar valor, toda uma corrente de trabalhadores precisam subir o nível. Um produtor de commodities precisa de boias-frias. Um produtor de microchips, engenheiros.
260 2018-02-22 02:08:14 Second, in the field of investment and production, the Riba banking system allows the outflow of currencies to the wealthy people who R able 2 pay the loans while the poor ones bear the expenses as prices of commodities rise up and this results also in national economy inflation
261 2018-02-22 01:56:57 $GC, gold seems like an easy short here. Dollar getting stronger isnt going to help other commodities either
262 2018-02-22 01:47:21 A lot to digest, but it definitely isn't looking good. US stock market is always driven by a few strong companies, most selling-off. Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting these days. Most commodities taking a beating on dollar strength.
263 2018-02-22 01:31:45 but since no government is funded you better know how to pray to satan for your eternal salvation from your gold we build oz; and build gold stuff since its “cheap”  maybe even cheaper than aluminum who knows; bear markets in commodities are like options go offer for cents on $$
264 2018-02-22 01:27:45 A7: Any setting where we're isolated from those who care about us - friends, family, neighbors -- and where we're commodities contributes to our being violated. Where most of our interactions are with paid staff. #MeToo @rootedinrights
265 2018-02-22 01:22:34 #GartmanCleanOut Longtime commodities analyst Dennis Gartman who produces the daily "Gartman Letter" revealed Wednesday he had taken a significant loss on his investment in embattled Colorado-based Riot Blockchain Inc.(RIOT). #CNBC
266 2018-02-22 01:22:23 I hate to say this but I don’t see a good year for stocks. Commodities and cryptos will be the play in 2018
267 2018-02-22 01:17:45 Same here. Likely sideways chop in equity markets going forward. That's ok but not many other places to be. Commodities not quite there yet. Only trend that has started getting going is long bond yields.
268 2018-02-22 01:16:05 My heart is breaking! We must stop the hate and come together as one for our most precious commodities, #OurChildren He is absolutely right! God bless him for saying what everyone should be saying! #FixOurSchools #ProtectOurChildren
269 2018-02-22 01:06:25 Have you never experienced inconsistency in the markets and the impact that has on the availability and price of commodities in your lifetime? Are you not familiar with the saying, “saving for a rainy day?”

271 2018-02-22 01:01:22 One of my history professors and later on my committee for my MA, specializes in the history of cities in the American West. So I learned more about the history of cattle markets and commodities trading than I was interested in.
272 2018-02-22 00:57:36 However, I had to laugh when he wrote that in in 1879 Chicago was an "expanding frontier village with a population of twelve hundred." Chicago's population was closer to half a million at the time. The stockyards were already in place and it already was the center of commodities.
273 2018-02-22 00:56:28 Thames I think ends up platooning, but worry about playing time with Braun at 1B. Like the upside of Rosario and Williams, but they're unproven commodities

276 2018-02-22 00:48:55 Obvi, but like agriculture is one of the things that helped make all that other shit possible. 

Once large plots of land have monetary value, you need someone to leave it to. So you want to make sure your offspring is yours. Boom. Women become commodities, etc, etc.

280 2018-02-22 00:37:48 Arming teachers was discussed, but it was pointed out that guns don't kill shooters, teachers do.  With that in mind, consideration was given to potentially lethal classroom commodities such as pencils, staplers and scissors.  These in short supply, arming janitors was taken up.
281 2018-02-22 00:13:12 Youre look at it from the standpoint of socialism. Not everything has to be fair. Business is business. If money is being generated it should go to those that are the commodities.
282 2018-02-22 00:11:53 Nós estamos em um daqueles momentos que acontecem uma vez a cada duas ou três décadas, o mundo cresce como um todo. Todas as regiões crescem. Algumas em estágio mais maduro, outras mais incipiente. O resultado deste crescimento generalizado geralmente é uma alta das commodities
283 2018-02-22 00:08:03 Bolivia? Igual que Chile, Paraguay, Ecuador, Perú, son proveedores de commodities primarios al mercado mundial. Nada más, no entran en la categoría que señalo de industrailistas cerrados. Son economías muy abiertas, no tienen industria

285 2018-02-22 00:00:31 That's too complex to answer, but in general terms, the way we treat fighters and the way we all talk about them as if they're disposable commodities produces a culture that allows tragedies like this to take place.
