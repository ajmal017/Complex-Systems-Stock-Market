41 2018-11-14 23:41:38 I don’t think you realize that little tax cut doesn’t take effect until 2019, when you file your 2018 taxes which no one has done yet!  Your increase on your paycheck is being eaten up by higher prices elsewhere.  Stocks are down.

50 2018-11-14 23:34:38 Always wondered why they can't go 1/10%, instead of always going 1/4%. I'm sure there's a reason, but maybe it's outdated, like when they used to trade stocks in 1/4's, 1/8's and 1/16's not that long ago.

108 2018-11-14 22:52:56 thank god.  2 stocks is meh to me.  I also dont care about "how will the viewers feel about the pace".  I hope its 3 stocks, which seems to be the case tbh.
109 2018-11-14 22:52:47 Pour les fanarts ils disent que tu dois vendre des créations originales en petit stocks qui ne fait pas concurrence... c’est ce qu’on fait avec notre slash 
110 2018-11-14 22:52:32 Entre raffineurs et distributeurs, la baisse des prix du baril mettra plusieurs semaines avant d'être répercutée à la pompe. Ils doivent d'abord écouler les stocks achetés au prix fort. Même @EmmanuelMacron n'y peut pas grand chose, on appelle ça l'économie.
111 2018-11-14 22:51:45 Sure it can affect the stock market. It has done nothing but rise under Trump and GOP leadership. Add in the Dems and that they want to undo everything and investigate everyone and nothing gets done. Stocks go down. No confidence.
112 2018-11-14 22:51:31 Filed today: HB 349 by Rep. César Blanco, D-El Paso, would outlaw bump stocks and other items that "increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle."

113 2018-11-14 22:50:26 i think 3 stocks is universally agreed upon

115 2018-11-14 22:49:52 Thanks for the updating on stocks at this critical time!! It helps to have someone with your knowledge keeping us safe.
116 2018-11-14 22:49:28 I should mention that comparing it to pharmaceuticals, pharma had only 1-2% if the conversations around stocks talk about cryptos as well. Less speculative by a landslide
117 2018-11-14 22:47:52 I cant wait to play Ultimate.  Idgaf about the stagelist tbh.  What honestly matters to me is just playing and labbing stuff.

Although I'd love 3 stocks instead of 2.
118 2018-11-14 22:47:09 How is it not needed? It's used for hunting and target shooting by many. It's a great rifle.
How exactly would we ban bump stocks without banning the concept of semiautomatic fire? That was the problem the first time they were looked at. Bump fire can also be achieved without it

125 2018-11-14 22:41:15 If I read this right, it only studies the losses harvested. Is there a meaningful impact from the different performance of newly-bought stocks? I.e. if the replacement securities bought underperformed the sold securities, then that's a cost to be netted from the gross tax yield.
126 2018-11-14 22:41:10 Anything new with banning bump stocks or anything else with gun control? You said  you weren't afraid of the NRA...LIAR!
127 2018-11-14 22:40:11 I tend to avoid heavily shorted stocks. I find that short sellers appear to get it right more often than wrong so can be a nice ‘get out’ warning sign.
128 2018-11-14 22:40:05 Doesn't matter that it's not used for military. It isn't needed by civilians, and it poses a threat to the public. We also need to ban bump stocks.
129 2018-11-14 22:39:42 I don't think tech stocks are anything to do with crypto selloff. I think main reason was not having much volatility in prior weeks, which always ends with a huge volatility. BCH mining issues (some mine BTC as well). And of course stop losses were sitting there for months
130 2018-11-14 22:39:10 Yeah i saw, i'm happy with stocks and crypto for now, that's enough for me

I looked at what topics they're commonly discussed along with (using a social listening analytics tool) and 31% of the time, cannabis is mentioned alongside a cryptocurrency. Most these conversations were on Reddit too

This @CNBC cheerleading of #Bitcoin remains relentless
138 2018-11-14 22:33:08 Morgan Stanley Investment Committee update: "We reiterate our view that 2018 marks the beginning of a wide trading range that could last several years, representing a cyclical bear within a secular bull." #ausbiz #XJO #equities #investing #stocks
139 2018-11-14 22:32:29 Cannot believe the evening news is becoming extension of Today show. This was not evening news worthy. Nothing on 600 point drop in stocks, etc.
140 2018-11-14 22:32:02 6 mins for three stocks is too little and will promote time outs and, over all, will be bad for the community and the game.
141 2018-11-14 22:31:24 You can bet against stocks of companies that profit from the misconceptions. But the info uncertainty would have to be resolved for that bet to be settled
142 2018-11-14 22:29:55 US stocks have turned lower as Apple Inc led a decline in technology stocks, offsetting early support from tame US consumer prices data and a rebound in oil prices.

144 2018-11-14 22:27:18 Wow - never realized that. Thanks for the info! I remember coming across a hedge fund prior to 2008 that sold puts across 200-300 stocks and hedged with both long VIX calls and long index puts. The fund would make as much money on the hedge as the short puts.
145 2018-11-14 22:26:53 I’ve been doing simulation trading and I’m learning a lot about stocks. I can’t wait to play with actual risk when the time comes.

148 2018-11-14 22:24:59 And that's what the whole smallpox destruction campaign back in the late 90s was about. DA Henderson wanted to destroy the last stocks. People who wanted to keep it on hand to study it opposed it. They knew it could never be destroyed - that its "destruction" would be illusory.
149 2018-11-14 22:24:57 unrealistic downgrade of stocks. Yet investors think Apple or retail is till worth their money. #fail   buy people buy.
150 2018-11-14 22:23:42 As confidence is slowly lost in a market over time, why would you think prices are suddenly going to reverse and shoot back up? Does anything in life work that way? This is true for stocks, Bitcoin, the U.S. dollar (which is getting stronger at the moment) and especially gold.
151 2018-11-14 22:23:36 1. We moved 20% of our portfolio into four Chinese stocks this week.

Americans may find it hard to invest such a large part of their savings in a foreign country. We certainly did. But we have good reasons. (Thread)
152 2018-11-14 22:23:35 Hold on from buying any #uranium and #gold as market is going lower. When stocks break long term trend lines you get a rapid declines in short time. #WSTRF has been pumped by many. So stick to blue chip in #uranium space till market knows what’s it doing. Not speculations.
153 2018-11-14 22:22:57 ..and even when solid news does hit, stocks tend to dip.

160 2018-11-14 22:17:26 Interesting. I just assumed pensions had some mandate to be hedged against a downturn in stocks. Do they normally hold some form of tail risk hedge?

165 2018-11-14 22:11:55 Stocks are risk off at the mo but with rates at historic lows and a greater money supply, am I crazy to be very calm? My thought is where will all this money go? Under the mattress? Into bonds? Into banks? I can't see it... Animal spirit will return #AIM #STOCKS #shares

173 2018-11-14 22:06:37 I don’t think about it one way or another.  Price action of leading individual stocks and overall market will dictate for me.  Figuring it out logically or fundamentally has never worked for me.

179 2018-11-14 22:05:42 This is a move I should probably copy with all my cannabis stocks. But I kind of feel that this is a bottom that will start an upward trend. I knew the first Q numbers after legalization would be lower than expected. Kind of trapped myself. But I’ll hang in a bit longer.
180 2018-11-14 22:04:46 hello~ i can’t remember exactly how much but i believe it was around $40usd
181 2018-11-14 22:04:06 Again, nice try no catch. Stocks opened higher buoyed by a promising cpi report. But then they rolled over and despite intra-day rallies were on  their knees at the bell. The finished down 206; the S&P 21 and the Nasdaq 64. The inside looked like the indexes: 1 to 1.5 and 1.7.

211 2018-11-14 21:51:45 My long term prediction for cannabis stocks is once everything is said and done and we are through Canadian cannabis companies will rule the world:
1. Market will be stable in size
2. Low firm entry because profit margins will be low
3. The stocks will turn into dividend plays
212 2018-11-14 21:51:42 I will be very surprised if this leads to anyone leaving FB who wasn’t already inclined to do so.

240 2018-11-14 21:38:44 There are only two ways to do better than the market (assuming no leverage): 1) Hold cash sometimes with the hope that one can buy equities later at a lower price or 2) Choose a basket of stocks that produce higher returns than the overall market’s buy & hold return.

248 2018-11-14 21:35:50 But of course, those controlling company policy don't care about long term stability, because the shareholders demand constant and maximized quarterly growth so they can flip their stocks for quick profit, so the company ends up being the worst it can get away with.
249 2018-11-14 21:35:28 No. The “nice little rally” had nothing to do with shorts or selby believers. Check out NUGT and correspond the times of the mass buying back into gold stocks with RNXs rebound. Youll notice it started around 12:45 for both

May be configured w/bump stocks, flash suppressor or barrel shroud. A citizen doesn’t need these for self defense or sport.

267 2018-11-14 21:26:29 your only option is to buy bank stocks! An oligopoly, supported by OSFI, means your dividends can only increase over time.
268 2018-11-14 21:25:34 Very nice call!
269 2018-11-14 21:25:05 Many stocks are called undervalued by comparing them to other so called overvalued pigs in the sector, but this argument assumes the overvalued pigs valuation is justified. When the pig drops all the so called undervalued plays will also drop.

271 2018-11-14 21:24:43 Are more growth stocks, which is not my primary concern. Therefore, i am essentially takkng a position with th hope of future growth in, say, 10 years or more
272 2018-11-14 21:24:09 Les distributeurs ont des stocks à écouler, ils vont pas vendre au prix d'aujourd'hui ce qu'ils ont acheté plus cher il y a un mois ou quinze jours.
273 2018-11-14 21:23:57 And to briefly answer, i selected based upon some financial principles which involve the factors which fis posses that increase likelihood of long term success. I then compared this to others in the industry and took up a position. I am a value investor, these stocks
274 2018-11-14 21:23:29 $COTY, $AMD, $BWA, $NEM, and $XEC were the top five stocks that closed higher today.
275 2018-11-14 21:22:40 $GE, $AMD, $BHGE, $BAC, and $AAPL were the top five most active stocks today.
276 2018-11-14 21:21:59 Well, I have seen a lot of double matches begin with 2 stocks...
It will be a lot more common with the hazard toggle since it can occur every match.

281 2018-11-14 21:18:11 When people want to do really inventive things with film stocks, or specific things at least, I can see the appeal. Problem is the directors I can think of who have, like Soderbergh or Fincher, are huge proponents of digital.

294 2018-11-14 21:12:07 This is a lesson in diversification.

Most people think diversification is spreading across many asset classes (it is), or spreading across many stocks/coins (not as much).

It’s also diversifying process, methods, and time (ST & LT plays). This is a good spot for a LT BTC play.
295 2018-11-14 21:11:56 I Let price action show me the way last couple of weeks.  Zoom out to weekly to weed out the noise on individual stocks or sectors.  The pictures much clearer
296 2018-11-14 21:11:41 Like I said you can put in the rules that every player needs to check the hazards toggle. But it'd be really hard to enforce. 

It's the same with timer, 2-3 stocks during transition from doubles to singles, and player set controls.
297 2018-11-14 21:11:01 Stocks end broadly lower but bounce from worst levels. Dow -205, -0.8% to 25,080. 

S&P -0.8%, Nasdaq -0.9%.
 
Techs, retailers, financials lead sell-off. Apple $AAPL -2.8%, $AMZN -2.0%, BofA $BAC -1.9%

304 2018-11-14 21:07:51 Rate of change slowing or accelerating is a big driver of stocks.
305 2018-11-14 21:07:47 Happy born day!! I went to the .org website for the stock and there was not a place to purchase but it did tell me which stocks fail in October. Is there another site to purchase?
306 2018-11-14 21:06:49 I started in Jan when the market was ATH. So far I've lost money with Chinese stocks, weed stocks, blue chip stocks, and even worse I recently lost with puts in a bear market. How many more ways are there to lose in the stock market? Lol
307 2018-11-14 21:06:49 I can tell from my stocks. Down again today.
308 2018-11-14 21:06:14 I’m in and staying in now. Let’s see what the deal is with the current data
309 2018-11-14 21:06:03 Ummmm.....sure......I guess it was if you live in your whacked out utopia. Would you like to explain why stocks keep dropping???  Its been a 8 days since the election. Can't wait for this one.......
310 2018-11-14 21:05:59 Another volatile day for the markets with the Dow opening +200 and then dropping to a 300 point loss before closing down 200.  The more widely followed S&P 500 closed lower for a 5th consecutive day.  Tech stocks, particularly $AAPL, continue to weigh on the market.
311 2018-11-14 21:05:16 Stocks cutting into losses. Dow -60 points after being down almost 300 points.
312 2018-11-14 21:05:16 Srsly?  Your first paragraph today is, "there's still this kind of itchiness of people to suggest that maybe we're forming some kind of a low. It's unclear right now though."  

C'mon Captain Hedgie, explain upside resistance and moving averages!

325 2018-11-14 20:56:32 Ah, well, I've never thought about it that way. I suppose a light touch of masochism might be helpful when buying stocks in a correction.

335 2018-11-14 20:51:16 You hate CSW and are emotional. I get that. The emotions don’t make your predictions any truer than anything. I want to be able to pay people with my coins. Buy stocks with my coins. This is not supposed to be for trading anyways. Ticker is meaningless.

- Nasdaq: - 430 points (5.7%)
- S&P 500: - 121 points (4.3%)

Regardless of all reasons (some of which are highly legitimate), the recent market drop is exaggerated.

394 2018-11-14 20:19:56 I appreciate all the insight you provided for such a long time Tone. Hoping to see more about stocks in your feeds since crypto wont be back anytime soon lol
395 2018-11-14 20:19:32 best followers. I am looking for a platform where I can trade stocks and futures. Someone a suggestion? Thank you in advance
396 2018-11-14 20:19:07 8 minutes for 3 stocks seems like too much.

I think we should get rid of "starter" and "counterpick" bc more often than not it only confuses newcomers

A larger stagelist is easier to trim down to a smaller one than vice versa

Going to menu to toggle hazards isnt a big deal
397 2018-11-14 20:17:57 There are less and less fishing stocks in the SCS. You can see more Vietnamese fishermen around New Caledonia's waters (and not only) doing illegal fishing. They can be violent because of the pressure. We are talking about people, families, etc. One of the many consequences...
398 2018-11-14 20:17:41 I run a screen every week of the emerging markets and I'll have to say that this is the first time I have seen so many Chinese stocks (mainly Shanghai, Shenzen) breaking multi-year downtrends with the price and RS  at 26-week highs (vs MSCI emerging markets) largest in 5-6 months
399 2018-11-14 20:17:16 Just learned that corporate bonds have returned more capital to investors than equity, in aggregate, over the last 15 years. Suggests your portfolio should be weighted heavier in bonds than stocks.
400 2018-11-14 20:16:48 Chepa a renflouer les stocks d'organes des hôpitaux ?
401 2018-11-14 20:16:25 $YGYI growth stocks frequently show losses as they need capitol to grow. Have Patience. The strong will survive and this is going to rock.
402 2018-11-14 20:15:49 @JoesNewBalance is great. Repeat customer, stocks large sizes (I'm a 14).
403 2018-11-14 20:15:29 I did a paper short from .1095 to .091
404 2018-11-14 20:15:25 That's not very reassuring. Did they say why or just profit-taking as several of those stocks seem topped out -or in $FB's case, going backwards. Is there really a storm brewing?? Do they see Impeachment proceedings in the future?
405 2018-11-14 20:15:14 "Fishing Opportunities"...Fish-Head in the document
"manage shared stocks." 
 No-one has shares in our fishing stocks. Well, the EU does. I'm taking it out of context of course just as French fishermen take our fish out of the context of UK fishing grounds. #HELL #Tsclose
406 2018-11-14 20:14:40 We need a brave heart and not greedy to own these pot stocks. It sucks to buy and hold. $ACB $CRON $TLRY $CGC.
407 2018-11-14 20:14:30 The pound and US stocks are currently happier about whatever we just witnessed happen in #brexit
408 2018-11-14 20:14:20 $YGYI will be a short lived selloff, most MJ stocks down on earnings.  Bar is too high.  Great things coming. Shares are cheap.
409 2018-11-14 20:13:00 Democrats extend their gains and stocks continue to plummet... anybody else see a direct connection? That #BlueWave led to #RedStocks ... if you want to see growth, you better fix this situation and vote red in 2020
410 2018-11-14 20:12:40 Two stocks we often trade $AAPL $TSLA acting like opposites: $TSLA just waiting to go while tape holds it down, $AAPL anchor on tape

Peace, my doge... 
414 2018-11-14 20:10:58 my stocks gettin slammed I’m only blamin trump lol
415 2018-11-14 20:08:06 The best time to buy assets is during a market crash or a recession.... stocks, realestate, etc... Everything is literally on Black Friday sale
416 2018-11-14 20:07:53 So, financial stocks lower after new fears that Maxine Waters was going to try to dial back regulatory relief and go harder after the banks? Sorry, but this was known and as easy to see as if it was Elizabeth Warren saying this.
$BAC $GS $C $JPM $WFC all lower in afternoon.
417 2018-11-14 20:06:51 I wish I would have bought shares of the word “Plebiscite”. I’d never heard it 6 months ago and it’s seems to be having a huge year. My “Referendum” word stocks are tanking, mind you.
418 2018-11-14 20:04:25 Dollar DROPS stocks make HARD REVERSAL! DJIA flat!!!!!!!!!!!!
419 2018-11-14 20:04:19 I'm so food-happy! My Whole Foods got a huge new location, and promptly stopped carrying half the stuff I would buy there. Thanks, Amazon.  Anyway, this little local place actually stocks the one pre-made stuffing mix I can eat :D

Thanksgiving is back on the highlight reel!
420 2018-11-14 20:03:42 Get a robinhood account, go to the Web version to see how many people on robinhood hold a certain stock. The stocks held by the most people are high shorted stocks :) because robinhood loans/sells shares to shorters to cover the commission fee. Might find some fun in that.
421 2018-11-14 20:02:33 While this may be true, the stocks haven’t been anything but volatile for the last year... why would that change? (Not being a smart ass)
422 2018-11-14 20:02:28 $FB NHoD - took all that shitty $SPY $QQQ action today and held its own. That is something strong stocks do.
423 2018-11-14 20:02:26 And buying up their own stocks! THAT is what the GOP call “trickle down” economics.
424 2018-11-14 20:02:14 i dont really understand stocks or anything like that but i think freddos are a good investment because they only ever increase in value
425 2018-11-14 20:02:04 Tory cabinet are a bunch of shites 
5 hours of propagating bollox   
How about a public VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE
How about we storm Parliament 
and place the whole rotten lot in Stocks at Tyburn 
and pelt then with the rotting detritus they expect us to eat under austerity
426 2018-11-14 20:01:25 Economy was strong when Moron came in & stocks fall before & rise after midterms. Inflationary tax cuts & trade war screwing us.
427 2018-11-14 20:00:17 no. all bank stocks are down today but GS not leading the pack today (so far)
428 2018-11-14 20:00:09 Target 14.4: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible
429 2018-11-14 20:00:01 Crude oil has dragged energy stocks lower, but is approaching support levels
430 2018-11-14 19:59:45 Xtrade ; stocks ; lost
431 2018-11-14 19:58:58 Austerity is here soon. This economic boom came from the shoulder of the the low interest rates loans of the majority of population. They will suffer the austerity in order for the 1% to buy back their stocks and increase their wealth.
432 2018-11-14 19:58:35 c'est une façon d'écouler les stocks. C'est scientifique d'un point de vue économique évidemment pas d'un point de vue nutritionnel ou médical. Mais la nation nouvelle est une entreprise.
433 2018-11-14 19:58:28 he still likes the stocks he recommended at higher prices
434 2018-11-14 19:57:23 @MohnishPabrai Sir what's your View on 

Repco Homes, Care ratings , kscl, hcg, piramal, rain, and all other your favourite stocks ??????
435 2018-11-14 19:57:07 Back to holding my portfolio in cash. (Up 344.98 percent since I started in August2017) Market is controlled by the day traders that are volume alphas and quick orderers. Few stocks soar by crazy percentages just to fall even more. There is no order here, just fear and greed.

Also, if you're using an AR 15 to hunt, you might as well throw grenades into the forest and stop pretending to be a hunter altogether.

446 2018-11-14 19:54:03 Who wants to buy, and hold onto stocks in this market?
447 2018-11-14 19:53:34 Some 64 has moved to 4 stocks, so Melee is gonna switch to 3, brawl 2, sm4sh 1, and so Ultimate will have no stocks

We will instead do coin matches
448 2018-11-14 19:52:27 c'est possible que les stocks soient arrivés dans l'aprem, j'ai eu la meme actualisation que Law à 15 min d'intervalle, après je sais pas comment fonctionne leurs plateformes logistiques
449 2018-11-14 19:52:25 Using this low in the market to buy stocks that held up well, but not buying the market itself. Getting too deep into consolidation phase for me to attempt a swing with it.

452 2018-11-14 19:50:30 TY for keeping quality in paid for prepared food.  With so many restaurants focusing only on quantity to boost their stocks to investors.  There's a good feeling in seeing a company who cares for their products and customers satisfaction.

455 2018-11-14 19:49:10 I must have my mom in the right stocks.  A $200K account and she's down all of $300 today.  And that's not a hedged one either.
456 2018-11-14 19:48:54 If you know how to short stocks, I’d do that based on your comfort level. If you can go to cash in your investment account, I’d do that. But no way would I be long one penny right now as long as both the short-term and medium-term averages point down.
457 2018-11-14 19:48:36 Minecraft was   about massive stocks .

465 2018-11-14 19:46:13 The stock price in the US is crash now. American stocks and employees will also suffer a lot if American stock prices go down. Please help not to lower the stock price any more.
466 2018-11-14 19:46:07 I guess the motto is " If you can't pick stocks pick something."
467 2018-11-14 19:45:20 To clarify, most bull runs in crypto (& stocks) occur only after major selloff happens. I know many of you are scared, but you should realize things like this usually have to happen to result in a massive bounce back. This is the capitulation catalyst we need. Nothing more. #btc
468 2018-11-14 19:45:14 Bitcoins still still seems to hold up pretty well against stocks, oil and USD ;-) after testing 6k for months the fall from here will be huge !
469 2018-11-14 19:44:58 Fib levels are also acting as resistance levels in many stocks.

and you know that’s my son and i trust her cause she could dead rob me blind for thousands lol
472 2018-11-14 19:43:49 I get all this, but how can one distinguish between propping up and a true safety play, i guess because stocks are not responding in any meaningful way. Guess I answered my own question...doht!
473 2018-11-14 19:43:42 Dividend yield always drive yield retail stocks but influence is greater at some times. Rising div yield at $NLY is what is supporting valuation at book and providing them access to capital.  They and smart guys who've been in the space for a long time know this and play the game

476 2018-11-14 19:43:18 Cracks me up, the same Analysts who trash @facebook recommend all of the video gaming stocks. I use @facebook as a family album but the gaming companies seem to be having a negative impact on our productivity and culture. What do you think @jimcramer? #madtweets

482 2018-11-14 19:39:58 It’s already starting! Stocks are tanking, house prices are going down and interest rates up!
483 2018-11-14 19:39:31 You guys really need to stop blaming democrats for all your problems. You getting to the point where it’s really starting to show that you  are running out of excuses. You have all 3 branches. Stocks didn’t fall after the election. They went up first. It’s Trump. He’s losing it!

485 2018-11-14 19:38:55 et le coût énergétique d'extraction sur les métaux rares a tendance a être rapidement trop haut. D'où le fait que des multinationales préemptent déja les stocks.  
Bref, entre le pétrole et les terres rares, certains pays sont très très mal barrés .

491 2018-11-14 19:37:44 The value investing crowd lost its mind at some point.
Everything that looks "valuey" to me just seems capital intensive and the first thing to get killed when a recession comes. The best shorts are usually value stocks in declining industries or into recessions.
492 2018-11-14 19:37:37 Definitely. Watching the meltdown all the time isn’t healthy....watching (and owning...) stocks like $VKTX $CPRX $PAVM $NDRA etc. can drive one sick.
493 2018-11-14 19:37:37 Critical to our National Security my ass! We had plenty of access to steel at much better costs before you screwed it up. Have you seen the stocks for the steel companies? They are not doing too well either. You really do not have a clue what you are doing.
494 2018-11-14 19:37:34 @jimcramer I started buying stocks in April 2018.  Bought aapl (I’m a fan of watch/Iphone) Roku (I love mine), salesforce, Microsoft and AMZN (I shop there weekly) I’ve lost almost 2k the last 3 months! I’m thinking about cutting my losses.  What do you suggest I do?
495 2018-11-14 19:37:11 merci pour ces excellents liens. Le problème est comme toujours que 1 les stocks sont fréquemment sur évalués pour attirer les investisseurs , 2 le ROI est incertain, car les pics d'extractions seront vite atteints vu la consommation mondiale
496 2018-11-14 19:37:10 I don't understand what gives fans the right to complain about the Yankees spending money on Machado, Harper, Corbin, etc. Like I see these comments "NO!" "WE DON'T NEED THEM." They holding stocks or what? Shut the fuck up already.

501 2018-11-14 19:34:19 I’ve seen few stocks in my career as manipulated as $TWTR. Understandable because shorts know there’s a low probability of the company supporting its own shares in any way. Only massive insider selling since Day 1. Polar opposite of $TSLA.

527 2018-11-14 19:26:27 I don’t even look at my stocks daily at this point.  I just keep an eye on if I’m beating the market.

529 2018-11-14 19:25:54 We are approaching both a cyclical & secular top that will serve as the high water mark for decades. However there is one steep parabolic leg to go before we get there. We're near an end but S&P has 25-30% to go with Nasdaq & some stocks significantly more than that.
530 2018-11-14 19:25:52 Three stocks sounds like it should be the standard. The healthy medium between Smash 4 and Melee.

Thanks a lot California.
540 2018-11-14 19:19:46 Canadian pot stocks are going in the toilet and the provinces typically can't create a model to deliver.  Solution is to allow out of province sales online until they can get their s^%* together.

542 2018-11-14 19:19:38 Judge Jeanine , Maxine & Bloomberg open their mouths & already stocks fall! Gonna be a roller coaster ride it seems! Former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn once said, “Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a good carpenter to build one."

Once the U.S. makes cannabis legal... U.S. companies will take over the U.S. stock market. Also, costs to grow cannabis is way too costly in a super cold climate like Canada

574 2018-11-14 19:10:52 Briefly, there are 3 arguments:  1) empirical measurement of stocks and flows for comparing cities;  2) "rebound" or "backfire" theories -- efficiency advances shift and sometimes and expand aggregate consumption;  3) empirical evidence that GDP and emissions can't be decoupled.

578 2018-11-14 19:10:11 In our Sept 30 #WellingtonLetter we wrote "the top 10 performers this yr gained 122% of the $SPY. That means the other stocks were down on average.

595 2018-11-14 19:03:25 US net capital gains + taxable IRA distribs are ~200% of US Pers Consumption Expenditure growth annually.  If people's stocks fall, they'll stop growing consumption; that is 65% of US GDP, & that will affect the other 65% of people, & US tax receipts.

again today.....

how about tomorrow will we be shocked then too?
620 2018-11-14 18:54:53 I'm seeing lots of stocks with recent quarterly reports that reported good quarters and stock prices getting hammered afterwards. I'm thinking it's because an economic slowdown is coming and markets are pricing that in regardless of how good the previous quarter was.
621 2018-11-14 18:54:49 So your claim is that businesses were so sure there would be such a huge corporate tax cut that they started doing more stock buy backs which I guess you think was the only reason for stocks to rise a week after the election and continue rising for the next year.
622 2018-11-14 18:54:21 Obamacare. Insurance Companies stocks up 700 percent.Possible?
623 2018-11-14 18:53:53 @RepMaxineWaters @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump That uneducated Maxine Waters is killing the bank stocks.  She has no idea what she says when she opens up her mouth to the press.  She can't get anything through the Senate.  APPROVE EVERYTHING NOW for 2018.  Get it done.

Cook's decision to stop reporting iPhone unit sales going forward isn't going to help with services still a small percentage of overall revenue
626 2018-11-14 18:52:43 I'm not trolling you here Henry but stocks are literally only worth what someone will pay for them. In many cases (see the spate of bankrupt retailers and the likelihood of another energy bloodbath), that will soon be zero.

Yes, they represent ownership. But it's not that simple
627 2018-11-14 18:51:12 Stocks continue to dive, as MBS benefits (now up 22bp, and pressuring up against it's 25 DMA), as Lenders will be set to provide better pricing.  Yields nosedives a bit further down to 3.09% and being supported by 50 DMA.  Let's see if it holds.
628 2018-11-14 18:50:53 That would have been nice. 1000% gains 
629 2018-11-14 18:50:51 Guess people with money buy cheap stocks right now 
630 2018-11-14 18:50:39 Are you really surprised to see an over-reaction in this market? Some stocks are even dropping after good news. The point is that medical earnings are irrelevant in a rec market.

666 2018-11-14 18:35:51 Stocks holding out but well off highs. Globally, as per DB, 89% of asset classes have negative returns on the year. So, yes. It could get worse.

668 2018-11-14 18:35:27 And next they are going to limit stocks and shares to only 2 per household ? Yeh right !
669 2018-11-14 18:34:23 Maybe it's time to ask some hard questions, @Senficon. How much money do #EU parliament members & commissioners get in kickbacks from lobbies like the #copymafia? How much money do they get from stocks & shares of companies they should be regulating?
670 2018-11-14 18:33:54 Imagine game 3 and someone picks a stage, pummels a minute in with 2 stocks out and then oopsy whoopsy stage hazard left on. Restart the match, that'd suck for momentum

785 2018-11-14 17:48:51 Where will stocks be at the start of 2019?
786 2018-11-14 17:48:31 80% sh.term bonds/20% stocks 
787 2018-11-14 17:48:30 Bitcoin,  AAPL,  NFLX,  Pot stocks, selling off hard, are all incredibly positive signs for the value buyer.  
This is a necessary prerequisite.
788 2018-11-14 17:48:09 U.S. stocks headed for 5th straight decline, with Apple leading a drop in technology shares amid renewed anxiety over trade relations with Canada & Mexico - Bloomberg

791 2018-11-14 17:47:38 State rep. Chris Taylor is asking why Kimberly-Clark used the corporate tax cut from the #Trump administration to buy back stocks and not invest in plants and workers. KC representative says he can’t comment on how they spent the money from the corporate tax cut. #KimberlyClark
792 2018-11-14 17:46:36 What do I see? Bearish rhetoric is blasting at very high volume while many stocks that were making new lows are no longer making new lows. Basing action is in progress. Some good news is required.
793 2018-11-14 17:46:29 Pretty much every western publisher stocks took a drastic hit. EA being the biggest from 146 in July to 86 now. Ranging anywhere between 20%-40% dip in 4 months.
794 2018-11-14 17:46:15 70% of NYSE listed stocks are now below 200 day MA. Only a bunch of megacaps like $MSFT held this market up until today. Money is seeking shelter in recessionary stocks like $WMT because bonds are not safe due to soaring rates.  This makes this bear different and more dangerous

801 2018-11-14 17:43:44 $SPY @jimcramer Stocks have gone from oversold to way oversold now. Expect a snapback soon.
802 2018-11-14 17:43:44 Got a friend who made many millions on those stocks.  In the process of giving it back now.
803 2018-11-14 17:43:18 This argument keeps coming up over and over again... With a high capacity magazine and AR15 can take a lot of people out, and a good amount of ammo does not weigh all that much..  no the process to convert an AR, that's why these idiots are using bump stocks now.
804 2018-11-14 17:43:12 Could be true for stocks too. I say for ETFs only because most people trading stocks understand trading stocks. Some people less familiar with trading ETFs.

¿Que cachondeo es ese?.
812 2018-11-14 17:40:53 Absolutely. And vanadium stable recently. Doesnt make sense. But it makes even less sense that stocks like YCA or UPC fall in these overall market corrections while their underlying asset is climbing. Too many buying opportunities here but very little cash available!
813 2018-11-14 17:40:01 Getting a sense that a massive rally in stocks is coming. #anyexcuse
814 2018-11-14 17:39:33 When the plans to overfish shared stocks...
815 2018-11-14 17:39:01 1. Plan for FI early-20s
2. Save first then spend (50% or more on savings is good ratio)
3. Believe in compounding and invest saved amount in appreciating assets like Stocks/MFs and monitor
4. Accumulate emer fund
5. Over 10-15-20 yrs depending up on your progress you will be FI
816 2018-11-14 17:38:59 I've been eying up $TMRC as well, but unfortunately finding a broker which trades OTC stocks is next to impossible in the UK; I'm hoping that they'll start a ticker on the TSX or CSE like many other miners, time will tell I guess.
817 2018-11-14 17:38:32 The morning of the Microsoft Build conference, the news was out that Bill Gates approved Warren Buffet's purchase of millions of Apple stocks.

That day, MSFT = 96 and Apple = 185.
Today, MSFT = 105 and Apple =187.

Market is hard to predict even for a guru like Warren.

826 2018-11-14 17:32:47 $PCG, $CF, $CAG, $PGR, and $M are the top five stocks lower at noon today.

829 2018-11-14 17:32:06 Watch my brother @CitronResearch on @HalftimeReport try and tell everyone to short the Pot Stocks.  Some are bad, real bad but some are investments that should be made to hold for a year or more like $CGC.
830 2018-11-14 17:31:38 Hey,@dbrand Why don't you accept stocks?
831 2018-11-14 17:31:18 Higher interest rates and interest rates continuing to go higher minimum is 50% money market and 50% stocks
832 2018-11-14 17:31:05 Many of my stocks were showing - 4,-5 and -6% early doors. It changed better this afternoon though.
833 2018-11-14 17:31:04 $COTY, $AMD, $TWTR, $BWA, and $LKQ are the top five stocks higher at noon today.
834 2018-11-14 17:30:56 How about making the stock market great. Oh excuse me that's right, you can't, because of your ill advised trade war and Tariffs on the world. Prices are way up, stocks bleeding loses daily, Russell 2000 heading for less then 1500 today. @realDonaldTrump
835 2018-11-14 17:30:50 $AAPL doesn't depend on anyone. They have many suppliers for each part. Not 1 single supplier could possibly know demand. Look at Q2 earnings. The bears took it down on nothing but bullshit and popped it huge on earnings. Apple will be $250-$260 by February. #Stocks
836 2018-11-14 17:30:49 You'd think.

Boomers are moving 401k investments (that have been fueling the stock market for decades) from growth stocks  to more conservative investment vehicles.  

Something has to replace that investment stream. FICA and Medicare contributions are an obvious target.
837 2018-11-14 17:30:13 $GE, $AMD, $BHGE, $AAPL, and $PCG are the top five most active stocks at noon today.
838 2018-11-14 17:29:48 APPLE (AAPL)-WOW. Per our 4/23/18 letter (also see our 8/2 Tweet), we bought AAPL btwn $151/161 (low was 160.63 on 4/27-the start of our buy tail) looking for $180, $200 then $210.00/220.00 where we look to exit all remaining longs AND GET SHORT #AAPL #APPLE #stocks

842 2018-11-14 17:28:07 Beautiful! we need to get a bitcoin reset just like the economic reset. Bitcoin and altcoins are overvalued in terms of what they offer just like stocks.
843 2018-11-14 17:27:47 I have a buddy who bought some bitcoin a few years back when it was under $1000. He was smart enough to recognize the bubble and sell in the $15K range. I told him he should move it into stocks or IRA

He turned right around and put it all in litecoin >$200 
844 2018-11-14 17:27:46 Watch the number of stocks they buy back...
845 2018-11-14 17:27:41 She should be locked in to stocks. Not sure what you'd do with the barrel.
846 2018-11-14 17:27:14 agreed, although we have entered a period where not all currencies trade the same. NZD very interesting expression of this - close today over 6788 would be a new high close for this leg...this despite risk-off in stocks/commodities. 6850 big lvl above.
847 2018-11-14 17:26:46 The law of large numbers means that stocks will end green today
848 2018-11-14 17:26:43 We have many happy members but it's not done by 2nd guessing every move but by positioning in select stocks, with a solid trading plan.

850 2018-11-14 17:26:01 you're seeing stocks and bonds returning to a more negative correlation pointing towards commercial hedgers in bonds likely being right after all $SPY $TLT $TNX $DJIA $QQQ I guess we'll see....
851 2018-11-14 17:25:16 Talks of death cross in $IWM.  $AAPL entering a bear market and breaking 200 day.  Oil market collapsing.  All of this bearish sentiment really being expressed today.  And yet I find the price action of stocks to be constructive overall today.
852 2018-11-14 17:25:13 Not surprising. He’s better off. Cube sucks. I hope their stocks take a dive again. 
853 2018-11-14 17:24:42 Crazy drops. Are you still long these 2 stocks?

856 2018-11-14 17:23:45 defense to me means moving to cash at this point. it's quite possible that if markets in the us follow the bearish action in china and other markets around the world, both bonds and stocks will fall at the same time. markets seem to expect fed rate cuts will bail them out.
857 2018-11-14 17:23:29 My working thesis (first spelled out in March) is that the 9+ year broad bull market ended with the January blow off move in $SPY. Said some defensive stocks/sectors still worth owning, but overall trend has shifted. Nothing I've seen since then has dissuaded me from that
858 2018-11-14 17:23:26 @realDonaldTrump stock market reversed today, tech stocks causing market to go down all about uncertainty with trade war, trade talks with  China. I hope and pray that you can fix the stock market correction by getting a deal with China By November 30-Dec 1st with Xi. 
859 2018-11-14 17:23:07 China stocks going to explode
860 2018-11-14 17:22:43 Check China stocks out
861 2018-11-14 17:21:05 It's interesting that stocks are down at the same time Bitcoin is down.  So much for inverse correlation theory.
862 2018-11-14 17:21:01 2019: everyone is trading stocks
863 2018-11-14 17:20:18 I'm okay! They took a lot of blood and just wanted to make sure I'm fit and durable. Government checking to see if the stocks still good

871 2018-11-14 17:18:04 @HalftimeReport In physics, the observer effect is the theory that simply observing a situation or phenomenon necessarily changes that phenomenon. So to, perhaps with the stock market. That the investors invest in a trade is trade and let them pick the stocks that they like. Stop

881 2018-11-14 17:11:34 I always take the blame for my decisions.  I am reading financials not listening and figuring out the value of companies with or without the pumps. I am confidently invested in companies that will survive a bad day or month or year in the markets. These are spec stocks=volatile.
882 2018-11-14 17:11:02 Does he trade stocks?
883 2018-11-14 17:10:19 I don’t believe that matters because the game is finite regardless, and person with the most stocks wins no matter what. 

I see no difference in camping someone for 2 minutes than I do for 8 with stocks

891 2018-11-14 17:07:40 correct, it's not like there is a global glut of fish.  We can easily build up our fishing industries and find willing buyers.  We can also ban the harmful EU fishing practices to help conserve fish stocks.

894 2018-11-14 17:07:32 So just go by analysts recommendations. Really how useless is this? Some of the tech stocks may go up, but Facebook  may not recover from where it is back to 2017 1Q values. When Enron collapsed from fraud , only 1 analyst warned about this. Analysts are glorified cheerleaders!

917 2018-11-14 17:00:39 And what if he wants to buy stocks cheap :)
918 2018-11-14 17:00:32 I’ll admit, like all of Engro’s investors, I am furious over a lot of money that I lost in Engro stocks & bonds back in 2012 when the company almost sank.
919 2018-11-14 17:00:27 Oh .... so they don’t have stocks of your soundtrack CD ? 
920 2018-11-14 17:00:13 Would anyone trust Scottish fishermen with fish stocks. They became millionaires on the back of black fish. They’d strip the seas. Look at the Grand Banks
921 2018-11-14 17:00:13 Everybody’s portfolio is bleeding out. Whether it’s crypto or stocks. Even both we are drowning. #hodl
922 2018-11-14 17:00:07 I'm a UX designer. I can burn through post-it notes like nobody's business to make absolutely goddamn sure that everyone knows our client startups are empathy-driven. Looking for $160k plus stocks.
923 2018-11-14 16:59:46 oh you meant long AAPL -- good trade

I am trading stock indices not the individual stocks but watch key ones
924 2018-11-14 16:58:10 Oh and "bump stocks" are from the 80s
925 2018-11-14 16:57:08 Why does buying and trading stocks feel just like gambling at a casino but more like sophisticated.
926 2018-11-14 16:57:06 This has been a huge rotation out of momo #stocks and assets like #crypto and into value names. The question is will this continue? Some of the risk assets that are getting crushed are very difficult to value based on traditional measures. So no text book way to predict a bottom!
927 2018-11-14 16:56:56 stop loss on penny stocks is great it's like NO FUKIN WAY am I gonna lose 50 cents
928 2018-11-14 16:56:43 US stocks extend losses - DOW now down about 0.6%
929 2018-11-14 16:56:15 when markets start to act in extreme deviations from your expected distribution you need to consider whether your strategy is broken, even is the strategy is as simple as "own stocks over time", volatility is the indicator dont ignore it
930 2018-11-14 16:55:39 I have a history of dealing in both good stocks and absolute shit for trades but must admit I wouldn’t touch #PCGE with a barge pole, market is crap and I think most have been burnt in pcge at one stage or another, don’t think too many will be jumping to get in, RP has a history
931 2018-11-14 16:55:30 I heard it helps you save money and invest in to stocks
932 2018-11-14 16:55:05 You're pointing to a short term price movement to make the case that Bitcoin is worthless.

Stocks are falling too buddy. Are they worthless?
933 2018-11-14 16:54:48 oh but you're forgetting that if stocks are bad and money is good then if you put money in the stocks and they go more bad then the money goes away and you have to spend more money when the stocks are worse and it might take longer to get the money
934 2018-11-14 16:54:38 Bliar Blair is a loser as far as expecting that the British Public will take any notice of him.His past leaves him as a person not to be trusted.He failed the country by taking us into an illegal war,and then passing over the reigns to loser Brown who sold our gold stocks off.
935 2018-11-14 16:53:29 stocks are down 7.5% in a month, was that part of anyone's "bull case"

was that part of the strategy: own stocks the economy grows maybe with a long enough time horizon but i'm saying this market action is outside of normal and should be considered as extremely useful info
936 2018-11-14 16:52:39 $SPY I'm not so focused on the most popular stocks of the day but rather which stock(s) I might see there next. Example $NIO There it is  :)
937 2018-11-14 16:52:37  he’s surely brought it to just go yeh 18k for wine no drama i’m loaded , nobody actually likes wine  who even stocks 18k wine  must sell like 1 bottle every 5 years
938 2018-11-14 16:52:32 Anyone having a good day in the market today? My stocks and crypto are dropping. Bad week overall.

942 2018-11-14 16:51:16 The Bots are long stocks unhedged today. The Bots portfolio is down -0.1% for the day when $SPX is -0.55% and $NDX IS -0.63%, I call that a miracle.
943 2018-11-14 16:51:16 And why have Bank Stocks TANKED after Maxine Waters threatens to end Regulation rollbacks? 

What will happen when the middle class not only LOSE their tax breaks but get INCREASES INSEAD? 

Yes, keep lying Chuckie! You guys REALLY blah blah blah!
944 2018-11-14 16:51:12 Negotiations with patent holders on a normally land-based production of nano-carbon.from trash must be fruitful. Even if rendered coal, the poison and harmful ai pollution is bound. Marine biologists have to assist in avoiing harm to plankton stocks. Plastic patches are HUGE.
945 2018-11-14 16:51:04 There is an infinite regression of causes that all go back to the Big Bang. The ultimate cause of everything is the Big Bang. Why stocks fell today? It's the Big Bang's fault. Easy...
946 2018-11-14 16:50:59 Good advice given by her
947 2018-11-14 16:50:57 $3 billion drop in crypto market in the last few hours. Good time to go shopping. Its not as volatile as the stocks anyway
948 2018-11-14 16:50:55 Quelle transition ? Taxé pour donner une prime et couvrir décor ceux qui ont le marché du lithium et des batteries ? Et côté écologie on fait quoi des batteries ? On les enterre ? On les stocks ? On utilise en cas de panne ? IDIOTIES ! Cette transition n'existe pas ! FOUTAISE !
949 2018-11-14 16:50:51 How WallStreet works. Bank Calls early on energy names and short the stocks. Next Sell Puts to sheeple and then go long the stocks to trap their asses and Bank the cashflow and capgains on stock.

952 2018-11-14 16:50:11 Because money controls Wall St. and stocks. As long as the company keeps executing successfully all of this will clear up.  This is a classic manipulation.
953 2018-11-14 16:49:40 stocks drop and continue to drop lmao
954 2018-11-14 16:49:29 My sister was nervous watching her stocks the other day. Idk what stock she was looking at but she had 200 shares down at 40 per share. Oof..
955 2018-11-14 16:49:15 le pétrole est une ressource limitée sur Terre, l’augmentation des prix résulte juste de l’épuisement de ces stocks, les prix augmentent et augmenteront encore, donc au lieu de gueuler à propos du prix du pétrole, mettez vous au vélo ! merci
956 2018-11-14 16:46:50 Cash, management, analysts targets, potential - in a real bear market nothing matters all stocks go down regardless of how great the story  might be. Buckle up
957 2018-11-14 16:46:46 Nows the time to short all those stocks
958 2018-11-14 16:46:25 If it shows up on the stocks on my watchlist I trade

962 2018-11-14 16:45:35 A large percentage of Americans invest in stocks-Corporate Power is power to shareholders meaning us people collectively. You Leftists should try it sometime. Better for the corporates means better for the shareholders meaning those who own stocks, meaning us common folk.
963 2018-11-14 16:45:21 Yep cheap gas while stocks and oil FALL THROUGH THE FLOOR?  We had that in 1929 ..BUT I think folks then and NOW would rather have strong port folios than extra dollar in their pockets! @LizMacDonaldFOX
964 2018-11-14 16:44:52 20EMA/9EMA is still steeply(!) sloping down on these high beta names and working as a heavy overhang. Moreover, some of those stocks are clinging on to important support. If they loose it, things will accelerate.
965 2018-11-14 16:44:40 You could be on to something there 203bagger, I see a beating coming in 2019 in the general markets, which will make all stocks crap.  I'm selling 1/4 of my uranium position

971 2018-11-14 16:43:29 There is an enormous amount of inflation and Austrian economists point out that this is all in Assets which are conveniently not counted in the inflation numbers. Stocks, bonds, houses, art, vintage cars... Austrian economics was right entirely.

993 2018-11-14 16:35:29 They own the stocks. Therefore their net worth changes. Just because it isn't liquid doesn't mean they aren't more rich in that time.

996 2018-11-14 16:34:46 If you guys are pro 2A then why are you willing to give up bump stocks
997 2018-11-14 16:34:38 you see, we're winning the trade war TOO HARD, the dollar is worth SO MUCH because everyone just wants to buy american goods, that its making STOCKS BAD
998 2018-11-14 16:34:17 I live trickle down. My capital is hostage in old zero-basis stocks, can’t sell due to taxes. I pray for dividends  to reinvest in start-ups and young companies.
999 2018-11-14 16:33:57 I didn't say a rifle wasn't more effective. Bump stocks help fire at a higher rate, but greatly decrease the accuracy of the shooter. Also, it is incredibly easy to mill out an 80% receiver and build a semi-automatic firearm
1000 2018-11-14 16:33:52 Supply and demand dynamics at play, production in the OPEC cartel and U.S. WTI has increased. The strengthening dollar $DXY is another factor. This plunge in crude oil prices is also weighing on energy stocks.

1015 2018-11-14 16:27:49 If the problem is too many unstable white men get a hold of bump-stocked semi-auto rifles with 100 round clips and shooting up music festivals, ban semi-auto rifles, large capacity clips and bump stocks.

1030 2018-11-14 16:23:08 A bear market is an environment affecting most stocks. It is also a process lasting more than just a few weeks. A single stock/sector cannot have its own private bear market, just as a single city block cannot have its own hurricane.
1031 2018-11-14 16:22:36 Stocks does U-turn and turn Negative (approximately 250 point difference) on Apple stock, which is looking much like a Bear Market.  MBS has rebounded from earlier lows to positive territory (+5bps); and Yields are down to 3.13%

1040 2018-11-14 16:20:48 US #stocks turn negative again today after trying another rally on the open. As stated correlations are lowering which means individual stock volatility stays high as index vol has come down. I expect this to remain through year-end at least. I am still slightly biased to upside

1052 2018-11-14 16:16:39 For the record, bump stocks were designed to assist fine motor skills physically disabled individuals to shoot.

Why do they need our ''experiences''?

Its nothing but a way to cover the ass of whoever botched the numbers when the contract was written, or to cover Stocks incompetence.

1073 2018-11-14 16:07:59 At this point we'll have rising unemployment, falling property prices and maybe falling stocks => falling monetary velocity; at the same time the Fed is doing QT. Only once way for GDP to go, unless the Fed reverses rapidly.

1078 2018-11-14 16:06:59 You’re right... that doesn’t.  The rich are rich because they understand OWNERSHIP.  They understand that certain things appreciate with value, such as stocks, equity, etc.  Most middle class don’t have money in a single mutual fund, let alone high dividend paying stocks.

1086 2018-11-14 16:04:56 Some current practices in industrial fishing like the use of FADs  continue to have negative impact on fish stocks as they are indiscriminate of the species and sizes of seafood they attract which are eventually caught in the nets. Need to adopt sustainable fishing methods.
1087 2018-11-14 16:04:18 Though, personally, if I wanted to address rate of fire policy wise, I would have started with magazine capacity and bump stocks (which are still legal and will remain so while Trump is in the White House).

1091 2018-11-14 16:02:47 We burn more oil than we produce so it seems likely that a drop in prices helps cash flow. But the producers get their stocks or bonds hit as investors discount future cash flows as well.
1092 2018-11-14 16:02:40 It's a good general analogy. I think people get tripped up because they oversimplify. Trend following works when stocks steadily decline over a period of months and pays a premium when they head fake, which doesn't feel like how "normal" insurance works.
1093 2018-11-14 16:02:39 The thing with stocks like $AAPL, $GOOG and $FB is that they have these huge periodic drawdowns before resuming the upward trend. History shows that you should buy them after they go down. Pretty good value now on all three of these names.
1094 2018-11-14 16:02:23 It's never volatility when stocks are rising.
1095 2018-11-14 16:02:14 The US is suffering from untreated Mental Health issues which, when mixed with guns that can be turned into fully-automatic weapons with Gat Cranks and Bump Stocks, results in so many innocent deaths. We’ll never know why the Las Vegas shooter snapped. It will happen again.

1098 2018-11-14 16:02:03 Curious why there is so much focus on the FAANG stocks when they clearly are not the leaders in this market. Most are below the 200d, and have terrible RS numbers and ACC/DIS rankings on Marketsmith. Thanks.
1099 2018-11-14 16:01:08 The obvious solution to reviving fish stocks is to END THE EXPORT OF WILDLIFE. But that simple concept is too big for the dishonest folks who have administered fisheries for the past century. They'll dodge this too.

1104 2018-11-14 15:58:42 xRapid ramping up reduces risk to speculators, thus, they want to pay more for XRP. People pay up for success. This is why high growth tech stocks are so high in price, there is less risk of failure in the enterprise.

1148 2018-11-14 15:46:03 No I don't think so at all... And maybe even if 650-700 is the reality that's still too high.  15% stocks to use isn't supportive of much over $9.00 front month old crop or $9.50+ SX9 IMO
1149 2018-11-14 15:43:48 It's the mid-cap biotech ETF.. most of my stocks are mid-caps.. so that's the one I watch. Sometimes $IBB but they tend to go in tandem

1154 2018-11-14 15:42:25 I mean I get the point that somehow people have to be protected and that wealthy investors can expose themselves more easily to higher risks (and thus potentially higher returns)
BUT to not so wealthy people it is left to invest in exits of those investments  (e.g. stocks)

1177 2018-11-14 15:36:46 Exacto amigo hablamos de lo mismo, me da la razón con ese fragmento del libro, arriesgar más de 3% por operación requiere un win rate muy elevado, lo cual fue mi primer punto.

1194 2018-11-14 15:32:29 I was quite disappointed with the earnings from $CRON $TLRY and $CGC, i expected large EPS miss but revenue and sales miss was worrisome.

However, the idea that these plays are only down 5-10% is encouraging. These results should have dropped the stocks 30%+.

1205 2018-11-14 15:29:39 I guess it kind of depends on how you look at it and your time frame. 

I happen to be saving heavily in cash because I find stocks (and bonds!) extremely overvalued. Doing nothing and losing a few percent to inflation over 2-4 years is better than losing half in a crash
1206 2018-11-14 15:29:08 It was related to stocks

1208 2018-11-14 15:26:25 The only thing Michelle Obama accomplished in the White House was starve our kids at school lunches and try to drive down stocks at McDonald’s to where they started selling apples 
1209 2018-11-14 15:26:15 $BLFS and $AMRN are on my watch list.  Fundamentally excellent businesses with potential for major growth.  Technically the stocks need to change trend before we buy them (as measured by 9 and 20 day ema).
1210 2018-11-14 15:26:07 Current issue with trading. I need to fund my account a little more or trade lower priced stocks. My trades arent bad but im not buying enough stock to make a profit.. but more knowledge is more power!
1211 2018-11-14 15:25:58 Stocks either make me cringe or smile hard. No in between

1215 2018-11-14 15:24:33 I dunno carl: Hard to look at the chart and not see flat stocks and weakening GDP as a result of weak oil prices. I think the role of oil in the economy is vastly more complicated now... not entirely clear that low prices are the unalloyed good they once were.
1216 2018-11-14 15:24:19 If it gets any lower I’m gonna have to bite the bullet and buy some. I used to own apple but I sold it. Probably the biggest mistake I’ve ever made regarding stocks. By far. Still hurts thinking about it. Ouch. Sold it at $144.

1247 2018-11-14 15:12:36 I don't mind a bit of physical as well.  I'm not entirely against it.  I would like to stack some more.  But the stocks are over-hyped, and marketed to "tourists" through an ideology rather than a risk/reward equation that other mining stocks must live up to.

1280 2018-11-14 15:02:59 To prevent congressmen from insider trading schemes Elizabeth Warren suggests they be banned from owning stocks.

 “They can put their savings in conflict-free investments like mutual funds, or they can pick a different line of work,”
1281 2018-11-14 15:02:19 Will this also include banning Senators from owning stocks as well? Rules for thee, not for me will not work. Also, you want to get rid of a bunch of the scandals, institute term limits on the house and senate. 2 terms max.

1312 2018-11-14 14:49:38 It is always a matter of time. But how long? They won't pivot until credit bubbles are popped. They can't afford to. certainly not because stocks are down a tiny bit. Inflation has not been predictable in models for a decade, so don't conclude it won't show just up based on oil.
1313 2018-11-14 14:49:13 Ryan, does it make sense to you that if we do get a bear market that leads to a big sell off in ETFs, there will be some seriously good buying opportunities in the less liquid stocks in these ETFs? Value investors should swoop in eventually, but there should be a window.

1442 2018-11-14 14:04:12 The point is companies own the government and are actively screwing people. If it's more profitable to harm people, companies will do it. The only people that matter to capitalists are themselves, executives, and shareholders (83% of all stocks are owned by 1% of the population).
1443 2018-11-14 14:04:04 i saw LOST and STOCKS.... 
1444 2018-11-14 14:03:35 mostly just stocks but once in a great while leveraged etf on a sector or commodity
1445 2018-11-14 14:03:29 Incoming new trend;as I predicted the advent of the rise of"boring stocks"...! YOWZA.
1446 2018-11-14 14:01:56 ...or walk on a sidewalk.

...or use the internet, which was initially developed by the government.

...or enter into any business contracts that could be legally enforced/disputed, because that depends on our court system (rule of law).

...or buy stocks/mutual funds, etc.
1447 2018-11-14 14:00:10 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 9 stocks Tuesday including $THC, $APTI and  $LVS.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 16% in $QIWI where November 12.5 calls bought for $0.67 closed at $0.78.
1448 2018-11-14 14:00:01 Poor Pre-Market actions again. Few stocks with volume but not really traded, look more like institutions are manipulating pre-market. I’ll watch $UVXY $SPY for any potential moves. 
1449 2018-11-14 13:59:33 The gift of missing earnings and not making money? Can probably buy these stocks 50% cheaper than now by end of year

1454 2018-11-14 13:56:44 $GOOS back on the watch list -- though like many stocks we'll see how its earnings reaction plays out over the next few days
1455 2018-11-14 13:56:00 More failure ahead unless a more reasonable course with #China trade is found.  Stocks will not rebound until then. This is why global growth is slowing
1456 2018-11-14 13:55:59 $MJ - Cannabis stocks likely to be in focus following mixed earnings from Tilray $TLRY and Canopy Growth $CGC. Shares Of Tilray and Canopy declined 4 percent and 9 percent, respectively.

1470 2018-11-14 13:50:28 It defies all logic, but it works. Ratings are really low, they're still begging for Network subscribers but it doesn't matter. Their stocks are doing great and FOX just dropped a ton of cash on them for SmackDown, in addition to the huge money they get from USA.
1471 2018-11-14 13:49:55 Aside from general $XBI weakness, I can’t wrap my head around this price action in $SRPT. The offering is barely dilutive, and the stock’s rally this year was driven by in-liscenced programs. Now management has more money to make similar deals and the stocks sells off?
1472 2018-11-14 13:49:49 I bought mine from the website directly!! was thinking if i should collect the pc but quite hard to find smile and pleased ver T^T

1478 2018-11-14 13:47:02 Bump stocks use the recoil of the gun to depress the trigger against the finger, rather than the finger depressing the stationary trigger, making it much faster than a human is able to move their finger. It becomes essentially an automatic weapon. Your mom needed birth control.

what do you think of these charts from a traditional markets perspective? i would think that stocks that look like this can be declared dead businesses, right lol?

1626 2018-11-14 12:21:10 remember when the Bush presidency left our economy in a wreck, millions lost their homes? Stocks tanked. 401k's tanked. Remember how after hard work (with all Republicans fighting against him) how he brought it all back from the brink?

1644 2018-11-14 12:08:34 I dislike trading in stocks based in USD. You get scalped on the exchange rate buying and selling. Makes it extra difficult to keep profits. Buuut.....it also kept me from getting $TLRY at $65 about 10 days before it hit $300, so sometimes the premium is worth it.

1705 2018-11-14 11:23:57 There is a very strange disconnect at the moment: too much low grade rubbish confusing the market maybe and a general lack of knowledge.
3 stocks max have a decent chance IMO.

There is no 'at best' here - it's just bad. Not 1 reason to use it and every reason not to. Shame harder - they will not let go otherwise.

You also left off the biggest reason: stocks begin life with a value basis, & have a working control.

1726 2018-11-14 11:04:34 People like Akash Prakash are now stating that it now is just fancy to say Indian stocks are a "buy and hold forever". Do you reckon he's right? It certainly seems like a pretty risky time to enter the market but does that hold true with a perspective of 3,5 or even 10 years?

1734 2018-11-14 10:53:41 Given that many recent economic indicators are showing signs of growth slowing down, maybe quite rapidly, they should overthink withdrawing their stimulus. Just my opinion. On the other hand, they are running out of Bunds to buy. Problem solved by buying stocks, but they won’t

1743 2018-11-14 10:44:07 Those people know nothing. Cube stocks didn't even drop when Hyuna left much less Edawn. So how will they go bankrupt?! LOL In fact they're doing better since BTOB is doing great & g-idle is top rookie along w/ IZONE. Not to mention Guanlin & Seonho's group debut next year.
1744 2018-11-14 10:43:11 ASF supports sustainable rec. & subsistence fisheries. ‘Sustainable’ means no fishery should consistently push a population below its minimum conservation limit.

1751 2018-11-14 10:34:54 is that really the reason? 
the only best thing we came up for that is, that we prevent people from taking risks but only leave them with the option to buy from already rich investors at a huge markup? (e.g. stocks?)

1. Markets move in cycles, and that you’ll have horrible days
2. You won’t get what you expect in investing, but what you deserve
3. Risk lies not in your stocks or in the market, but in yourself...

1. SGR reduced truck cargo from MSA to NBO
2. More reliable elec supply reduced need for generators running

Penny stocks are very unpredictable so rather not comment on price. $KNSC has had months to plan. Time to execute swiftly

2098 2018-11-14 04:39:55 Some states banned bump stocks, require training on how to use a gun, require background checks. VT is a very proactive state in dealing with guns.

2106 2018-11-14 04:31:53 People from all walks of life own stocks in Amazon-like corps. They get to decide and question the management during an annual shareholder meeting.

2121 2018-11-14 04:21:38 No good reason to buy stocks with oil down below $59. Not a good sign. We may be going much lower
2122 2018-11-14 04:21:08 (a) lower prices on the back of large domestic (US) stocks (b) China getting a large share of supplies from South America
2123 2018-11-14 04:21:07 I think the driver of yields down will have nothing to do with Central banks. Rather I think EU and corps are a disaster and money will flee from EU sov credit and stocks into USTs. In short Panic

2201 2018-11-14 03:31:38 Boom sold 100% of my stocks today. The interest cost to service the exploding national debt is going to cripple this country!
2202 2018-11-14 03:31:35 I love penny stocks but most people know they are fake companies to sell shares. This is an actual company. Potential to make a lot of $$
2203 2018-11-14 03:31:03 From Tim_Preuss: Investing is the same whether you’re talking about stocks, businesses, people, or politicians.

2207 2018-11-14 03:28:19 Medicare for All is literally public funding of private care. Yes, you will need private care. Plus, you could have supplemental private insurance for things like plastic surgery.

How do you feel on a ban on bump stocks by the way?
2208 2018-11-14 03:26:32 Between Jan 2003 & Nov 2018. Given the strong management pedigree & its business plans the stock holds good potential for doing well going forward. From other tyre stocks J K Tyres looks good. It's so cheap. This is not a recommendation. Purely observation & academic discussion

2211 2018-11-14 03:24:40 I'm civilian (but former military). If I say I need an AR15, I defy anyone to tell me why I can't have one.

Bump stocks go against my training and by nature denote a lack of fire discipline.

The constitution does say "not be infringed", so I steer a wide berth around all this.

2213 2018-11-14 03:24:11 The announcement sent Lumentum  down  33 percent, and many other tech stocks fell as well.
2214 2018-11-14 03:24:03 I can’t imagine that California’s being on fire could have anything to do with stocks falling. But this also ties to Trump because of his threats to withhold disaster relief funds. The man really is going ‘round the bend.
2215 2018-11-14 03:23:19 J.C., go check out the US Long Bond priced in different developed market currencies. Much different perspective than a simple domestic view. If you do the same with the DOW, in terms of foreign capital, you are doing fine in stocks & getting crushed owning bonds
2216 2018-11-14 03:23:14 I no longer hold any stocks, just warrants.
2217 2018-11-14 03:23:12 a little luck never hurts sometimes!
2218 2018-11-14 03:22:39 Going by the reports that crude could decline this would be a good time to pick tyre & tile stocks given the sharp correction they have undergone. Stocks bought in bad times have the potential to give above average returns. Balkrishna Industries' Mcap has gone up 1,000 times
2219 2018-11-14 03:21:45 You want to know why the #Dow is tanking? Because we're starting to hear the agenda of these young, progressive radicals, and some of the old ones, talking about fossil fuels, taking down the banking industry. You name it. #ElectionDay #stocks

2231 2018-11-14 03:12:00 What about real estate companies stocks?
2232 2018-11-14 03:11:18 You shouldn’t ban something because a very small % use them in crime.With that thinking why not ban cars, planes, all knives, or hell anything a small % uses to harm others. Way more car deaths than homicides with AR-15’s. Now bump-stocks should be banned, no practical use.
2233 2018-11-14 03:11:17 Cassandra was bad at choosing stocks
2234 2018-11-14 03:07:48 Show me a statistic of how often illegal modifications occur, because I guarantee lawful gun owners do not do this. Bump stocks do not make a firearm fully automatic. Mass shootings by and large are not done by AR15s, nor is the use of bump stocks common.Again, come on man
2235 2018-11-14 03:07:47 Your core thought here is a valid one, companies under a capitalist system will always seek maximum value and will do that by whatever means necessary by screwing over the consumer and employee out of their money as much as possible. Not quite accurately reflecting stocks tho
2236 2018-11-14 03:06:00 Wont last. Give them about 4 years and stocks will drop. Ny and Md will get their promised breaks back... they talk big. Why would you put that large a company in an area of uber rich folks and a high cost of living?
2237 2018-11-14 03:05:43 Calm down, captain; I was being ironic and we all agree that you can make a mass shooting without a bump stock (although you really really really shouldn't, with or without bump stocks).
2238 2018-11-14 03:04:11 Technicals on oil stocks are completely destroyed. Going to take weeks to recover. Brutal
2239 2018-11-14 03:02:41 Yes illegal to modify, but it's done.  Funny, bump stocks legal??, certainly easy.   True,  most deaths handgun, large numbers of suicides.  Mass shootings by and large AR15's, some modified or bump stocks.
2240 2018-11-14 03:00:20 I tend to become interested in stocks that by their very names or circumstances inspire an unwillingness - and an 'ick' accompanied by a wrinkle of the nose - on the part of most investors to delve any further. -- Michael Burry
2241 2018-11-14 02:57:22 Going lower like everything else. Crashes are deflationary and miners are stocks. But when the #Fed reverses policy, you want to have loaded up on these ahead of time. Why I've said that when stocks are 20-30% off their highs, load up on metals and miners IMHO.
2242 2018-11-14 02:57:05 They actually kinda were tho. The stocks in them and stuff.
2243 2018-11-14 02:56:09 The NRA doesn’t pull the trigger, but they are solely responsible for a complete lack of any sort of legislation that keeps semi-auto guns/bump stocks etc. out of the hands of the mentally ill. How you close your   to this makes me embarrassed for you. That is called complicity

2249 2018-11-14 02:49:17 I agree with you with #5... but how could me only 20% of your stocks makes real money? You must be trading volatile stocks? I have about the opposite results over the long run.
2250 2018-11-14 02:47:00 There is also the issue of these kind of mergers making it harder for mutual companies without banks to as effectively reach new generations of clients. The mergers of lending and investment businesses give a bit too big of an advantage to mutual funds and stocks.

2268 2018-11-14 02:37:38 They’d buy more republican lawmakers at the state and local levels who would loosen what laws exist, so that more unqualified people can have guns.

2269 2018-11-14 02:37:14 Way to go fuck head

2279 2018-11-14 02:29:01 There are a lot of guns similar to the AR-15, so I think it would be more effective to focus on high capacity magazines, bump stocks, universal background checks, red flag laws, and closing the loopholes that allow some domestic abusers to own guns.

2308 2018-11-14 02:01:36 I’d disagree as far as stocks boosting even if loss for Spence. Mikey absolutely this is a win win for him. Spence not so much cuz he doesn’t prove anything we don’t know yet. Say if he beat someone who stylistically can out box & out move/jab him like khan, bud, brook can
2309 2018-11-14 02:00:46 What really challenges & excites me personally is not stocks. 

It is MF investing. Finding ways of investing very differently & making investment calls very different from the herd is tougher than stock investing. 

Outperformance is not easy.

2312 2018-11-14 01:54:40 Sure.  If bump stocks were illegal perhaps one man couldn’t have mowed down a crowd.  Everyone but the NRA and their paid shills seems to agree they have no value for sport or defense, but they still oppose regulating them.

2343 2018-11-14 01:33:35 The only difference between the AR-15 and ANY other semi-auto gun is magazine capacity. Obviously, the use of a bump stock changes everything, this basically make the AR a fully auto gun - ban the bump stocks and limit magazine capacity. Mental health is a big issue!
2344 2018-11-14 01:33:31 They probably didn't have bump stocks. You can't have a mass shooting without a bump stock.

2365 2018-11-14 01:13:10 US stocks mostly fell on Tuesday, weighed down by steep losses in the energy sector as crude oil plunged, although confirmation the White House and China were talking again on trade helped limit broader market losses.

2428 2018-11-14 00:18:26 #Stocks,#Indexes The SPX bottom signal is nearly as strong as that at the late October bottom, which indicates a substantial rally, now likely to test the recent SPX high of ca. 2810.
2429 2018-11-14 00:15:59 so limited stocks of cat animations? frick
yeah save our internet.
2430 2018-11-14 00:15:17 Senator Scott, great interview. @TeamCavuto tends to be an alarmist. He is more interested in his crude oil stocks dropping then what benefits the American people. Lower gas prices at the pump are always welcomed. @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @WSJ @BillOReilly @faagifts
2431 2018-11-14 00:15:16 surfing fag has just informed me about bit coin stocks
2432 2018-11-14 00:15:05 As a first gen student, no one tells you how lost you're gonna be in a personal finance class where you don't know any terms because your parent(s) never knew how to save, buy a home, invest in stocks, etc.

2433 2018-11-14 00:14:03 @realDonaldTrump if you take the credit for the stocks going up(winning) you have to take the blame when they drop (loser). Thank you for playing. Here’s your participation trophy.
2434 2018-11-14 00:13:02 While our stocks R on a rollercoaster. NOT impressed.  Jobs were already moving in position direction, & stocks were higher... PRIOR to you invading the White House.  U can’t even keep your wife under control - which surprises me with YOU being Narcissistic, but how EMBARRASSING
2435 2018-11-14 00:12:31 Energy stocks in the S&P 500 have been slower to react to the steep drop. Since the start of the October they have fallen 14%
2436 2018-11-14 00:12:28 I’ve been reading about stocks for hours. If anyone has any tips hit a sister up
2437 2018-11-14 00:12:11 After 1 Million is reached I wanna do more challenges... Which ones do you want me to do (tradingwise) ?

2438 2018-11-14 00:11:40 I’m sure Bell has been ultra conservative with his prior NFL earnings, investing in a low-cost, passive portfolio of stocks and bonds while setting aside 3-6 months of cash for emergencies.
2439 2018-11-14 00:11:21 Ok but if you buy the stocks you won’t be able to afford the fake pizza for the kids.
2440 2018-11-14 00:11:18 It's how I feel about Sony's stocks too
2441 2018-11-14 00:11:00 I wish I had invested in Kleenex in Nov 2016.
I cleaned up on tinfoil stocks.

2443 2018-11-14 00:10:14 Listen to today's $VFF call  far better positioned than most MJ stocks at 1/10 the valuation
2444 2018-11-14 00:09:42 I used to watch 10 minutes of that each morning so I could replenish any stocks of rage I might have lost overnight
2445 2018-11-14 00:09:25 I voted for Trump because of what he promised and he os continually delivering. Oh my bank account, stocks and 401k says I’m really winning. Stay tuned

2447 2018-11-14 00:09:11 Actually Elon is buying stocks not doing it byback. A buyback is when the company buys back its own stocks and therefore removes stocks from the market. That will in turn increase the earnings per share. Another positive is that a buyback shows that you are strong financially
2448 2018-11-14 00:09:10 This is sorely needed. As you rightfully point out, protocol tokens != stocks and many metaphors/concepts from the stock market ("dilution," "market cap" etc.) have been rampantly misapplied in protocol token analysis.

2454 2018-11-14 00:08:11 I totally agree. If his poll numbers were real, why did they not do better at midterms? And his cronies are making a bundle shorting and buying stocks imho
2455 2018-11-14 00:07:46 Stocks lost all there gains today.  It’s overvalued and has been pumped up by borrowed money!  The US stock market is a nightmare waiting to crash. Massive bubble!
2456 2018-11-14 00:07:35 Tax cut really helping , right ! Not hardly unless you r a recipient to big stocks or executives in these companies , avg citizen taking hit with no increase and big deficits that burden our country !
2457 2018-11-14 00:06:26 He knows as much about the stock market as he does about everything else - nothing! He also fails to realize that most of his base do not own stocks, so they couldn't care less, and those who hate him and are stock investors are smart enough to know it has nothing to do with it.
2458 2018-11-14 00:06:17 Also, my 401Ks and stocks had a decent jump, at 1st, but now are pretty flat
2459 2018-11-14 00:06:06 $AAPL closes below its 200 day moving average for the 1st time since April #stocks #StockMarket #markets #investing #investments #WallStreet #Finance #economy #techstocks

2461 2018-11-14 00:05:26 its ok. just bought rdsa and xom stocks.
2462 2018-11-14 00:05:17 How can you say they aren’t when ALL of their stocks and numbers are going down. Even if your one high school is still supporting it, the general population is moving away from it.
2463 2018-11-14 00:04:57 For specific stocks on my watch list, and $SPY to an extent: MACD velocity towards >= 0, hourly RMI, RSI trendlines. Reversal patterns + gap fills + hammers. This is tomorrow only. No comment beyond.
2464 2018-11-14 00:03:48 Ge is using baker to issue debt. Then using that money to buy GE stocks.
2465 2018-11-14 00:03:33 Red ball:

2468 2018-11-14 00:00:05 Record low stocks. Record high deficit, record high mistrust of a sitting president.  Facts and words matter. Resign Trump!
