71 2018-05-14 18:16:16 Not a bad idea. As far as I can tell, most commodities remain substantially overbought, and it's a little late to get into real estate as everyone is starting to cotton on to why the markets are so volatile.

96 2018-05-14 16:30:36 120 million people are victims of high value!!
Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!
97 2018-05-14 16:28:29 Agreed.  I trade commodities and would love tokenizing the futures markets.  No more naked shorting and crashing the markets and forcing producers to sell at artificially generated prices.

102 2018-05-14 16:15:54 You are full of personal insults, Adam, but those are not arguments. The structural surplus came about as a consequence of the mid/late 90s deficit-fight and then improved GDP growth at the beginning of the commodities super-cycle.
103 2018-05-14 16:13:40 You are ruining universities.  Turning professors into service providers, degrees and learning into commodities.  The logic of the market should not be coercively forced into every single area of life.  We used to have greatest universities in the world.

175 2018-05-14 12:00:02 in a competitive market place there is always more than one buyer for valuable commodities.  A commodity differs from a service in that it has tangibility.  Something that produces commodities, an oil well also has tangibility.  The Internet produces intangible commodities.

235 2018-05-14 06:08:00 3/My main goal here is to pioneer financial astrology in Crypto markets, I 'm passionate about it and there aren't a lot of people doing it, so I'm hoping to be the 1st to really do it seriously and do it well. There are others doing stocks and commodities...
236 2018-05-14 06:07:40 Yes S. Prasad, there is one major flaw in your logic. Beer is luxury, petrol and diesel price is necessity. Increasing beer price will not affect other price of commodities but petroleum price directly affects common goods. So yes, your logic is flawed
237 2018-05-14 06:04:11 @Rabibehera64 petrol, diesel price hiked from today after 24th April, 2018 as the Karnatak Election is over. It will impact prices of essential commodities also. AchheDin? # President, Samajwadi Party, Odisha.
238 2018-05-14 05:43:11 @RahulGandhi Sir Petrol Prices were raised today.  So gas and all commodities prices are rising. Please call a bharat bandh taking all other parties into confidence... Please do what BJP did when they were in opposition. People should know there double standards..
239 2018-05-14 05:33:55 Boss. Rice has come down from 52 to 48. Pulses below 100. Pl make out your comments taking all commodities and compare with your period of (un )rule.
240 2018-05-14 05:27:23 Says by that bad things are happening in Venezuela because they are run by a “socialist” party doesn’t mean that is actually true....majority of businesses are private, government controls commodities which has allowed corruption to aid in collapse.
241 2018-05-14 05:13:29 Finally let every energy technology company acknowledge with their funds the damage caused to world governance and peace by the pursuit of the commodities they harvest and transport. As soon as a war is fought to secure access to wind and solar harvest, let them pay too.
242 2018-05-14 05:00:02 Commodities: Ethanol -1.24%, Wheat -1.06%
243 2018-05-14 04:55:52 Gee more dumb shit from the obtuse crew at the White House. And Europe too will find their farm commodities from other sellers. Further weakening the US. Putin has to be loving this shit.
244 2018-05-14 04:38:35 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
245 2018-05-14 04:25:47 Australia is great at ‘boosting production’ of commodities, while others value add for us.
246 2018-05-14 04:07:08 Concuerdo contigo. Ese es un escenario alcista! Por otro lado está la posibilidad de alzas en la tasa de referencia de la FED, que fortalecen al dólar y presionan a la baja los commodities.  Nadie sabe, por eso hay tomar coberturas!
247 2018-05-14 04:03:46 When equities become commodities
248 2018-05-14 03:55:09 Can u give the evidence of promise of 15 lakhs to everyone. Farmers income has been increased. But commodities are in controlled price. Not knowing around you. Pl open your eyes
249 2018-05-14 03:29:29 I should add, sometimes commodities are moved between different buckets and/or given different weights during a WPI revision.
250 2018-05-14 03:27:57 It's painful & pathetic dear.
We've so much lost our values here in Nigeria that many already have their conscience smeared with hot iron & no longer value a woman's life for any reason. They see them as commodities which are dispensable
251 2018-05-14 03:25:35 Economists will tell you that you can't apply the correct deflator to the nominal GDP  numbers if you don't have a price index the commodities that your economy deals in, weighted by the value of their trade.
252 2018-05-14 03:11:00 Algunos confunden comercio internacional con neoliberalismo.  Comprar y vender commodities no es un problema per se.  El problema es de grado.  Cuando se genera dependencia alimentaria
253 2018-05-14 02:47:19 Commodities Check

West Texas Intermediate crude was down 0.03 percent to $70.7 per barrel.

Gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,321.9 an ounce.

LME copper was up 0.36 percent to $6,942 a metric tonne.
254 2018-05-14 02:35:41 Commodities don't enjoy cycles?!? There may not be the same inherent growth factors that equities have, but no cycling is stretching things. 
Deflation's been in play for years and without any velocity and now rates normalising, it's going to be dollar denom debt destruction.
255 2018-05-14 02:23:20 Agro commodities are wasting
time to look into how our transportation sector can positively influence the Agribusiness sector especially in Nigeria .. #Land #Rail #Air #Water cc @Transport_gc @AsoRock @MBuhari

259 2018-05-14 02:04:02 Also like time is money? And sorry we live in a shitty capitalist society so time and effort aren’t free commodities 
260 2018-05-14 02:03:30 Yeah, a combination of being a lead exporter of gold, silver, zinc and other commodities during their super cycle plus a complete re-write of the constitution after the hyperinflation bust of ‘89 by a middle-right, pro-economy despot (Fujimori) will do that.
261 2018-05-14 01:59:43 La balanza comercial en commodities es positiva o no ve que @realDonaldTrump siempre se queja de como lo afectamos
262 2018-05-14 01:54:57 Thus the worker will always be a slave of men who possess the taxes, the land, &amp; the commodities needed for the gratification of his needs.
263 2018-05-14 01:53:52 Houses aren't homes anymore they're commodities, that's why the marginalised & poor are seen as undeserving of public housing.
264 2018-05-14 01:53:14 China is stopping or cancelling US contracts for commodities.  Farmers where i live depend on foreign sales to China....google soybeans for starters.

As for tg1e rest of your post about "be less shopping in States" have no clue what youre saying.

Please clarify.
265 2018-05-14 01:41:49 “Oh you liberals are all high and mighty with your rejection of explicit white nationalism and rejection of treating women as publicly traded commodities. 

All of your VIRTUE SIGNALING around treating people as human only entrenches my views more!” - “daring intellectual”
266 2018-05-14 01:29:51 I'm not too well educated on the issue, but if you were given some nice commodities while still being considered as a slave, would you have some desire to be free from such a title?
267 2018-05-14 01:29:21 Explícales por piedad, en serio, lo que significa COSTO DE OPORTUNIDAD... importar commodities en lugar de tecnología nos debilita y no nos deja competir y menos liderar un mercado #AMLOpresidente
268 2018-05-14 01:28:17 Great to see @MoodysInvSvc mentioned in @IANMCGUGAN article for @globeandmail from May 1, 2018 covering @GoldmanSachs report on #Commodities.  Lack of investment in new mines is very important factor, but it's even worse in exploration! Anyone writing about limited exploration?
269 2018-05-14 01:18:13 It's the evolution of capitalism from companies run by founders with advice from boards to companies run by boards for the sole benefit of investors. Not only employees, but the companies themselves have become simple commodities.
270 2018-05-14 01:11:28 #EconomyToday Dollar in check, TNX holding up. Futures SPX should have life for Monday. Good start to week. #Gold - Commodities not ready to go down unless Dollar makes move up. Not Yet I guess
271 2018-05-14 00:55:54 Geez. I forgot how much the MTG card market was basically a small scale commodities market. Seriously, if you can make any money buying and selling MTG cards then you'd probably be successful in playing the Stock Market.
272 2018-05-14 00:48:12 Ping pong balls are one of the most valuable commodities!

274 2018-05-14 00:38:49 That’s been a pretty underwhelming Texas offense, I think. Their punter was the most exciting part. But he’s currently my WR10 for 2019; not sure where I’d draft him in April, but dudes who move like he can for that size are commodities.
275 2018-05-14 00:31:17 Like most times in Hockey, Right Hand Shots are precious commodities.
276 2018-05-14 00:27:01 Capitalism is built on the fucking VIRTUE that humans are disposable commodities. The more we raise our generations to believe that this system is one of honor and therefore just reward, we will continue to fail the most frail & vulnerable of our very own.
277 2018-05-14 00:24:13 Es de terror que Lilita no se informe como es el mercado de commodities en la Argentina.Amen de darle de comer a las fieras.
278 2018-05-14 00:23:12 Have heard reports that #China has ordered an immediate shutdown of Graphite Production in Shandong ahead of Summit being held in June in Qingdao. Circa 9-14% of Global Supply. #graphite #commodities
279 2018-05-14 00:08:06 Oil averaged $95 a barrel between 2010-2014. It was highish but a welcome relief from $150 a barrel before the GFC. Relative to other commodities it was low as Gold/Silver/Iron Ore all made new all time highs in 2011. Rare for a recession with increasing Gold to Oil ratio...
