11 2018-04-25 23:57:44 To complete my explanation: note that if both the dollar and oil fall in value simultaneously you see no change in the dollar price of oil. The same happens if both increase in value simultaneously. If one falls and the other increases you see a stronger effect. Hope this helps.
12 2018-04-25 23:57:42 Jon its fine, they have oil. Thats all america needs to justify an attack OR an imvasion

15 2018-04-25 23:57:10 It's fascinating to watch the people who got bamboozled by a demagogue (when the time was ripe for demagogues) continue to pitch the snake oil.  America said NO. American voters said yes to HRC by a historical landslide. He's outnumbered by MILLIONS.
16 2018-04-25 23:56:44 @HardballChris it’s hard to believe that we could have safe drinking water and clean air when Pruitt is such an oil spill. Is there anyone greasier slimier than him?

40 2018-04-25 23:55:21 just learned how to change my oil for the first time 
41 2018-04-25 23:54:30 #TIL:

1. Spray mount + vegetable oil = hydrophobic surface

2. Spray mount is impervious to soap, spirit gum remover, gin, denatured alcohol, dirt and vinegar.

3. Never cover your hand in spray mount. Ever.
42 2018-04-25 23:54:18 No one worries about us who are scrapping along when our property tax and other expenses go through the roof. If we can’t get more hours at work, we must do without. I kept thermostat at 60 this winter because another tank of oil was a budget buster
43 2018-04-25 23:54:17 Changed up the ratio of flour and 00 flour to more 00 flour and using a new olive oil (and more of it), then a one day rise with bread bucket lid cracked a teensy bit in the fridge followed by 2 closed. Then bake. 

I tweak those variables every so often mostly for fun.
44 2018-04-25 23:54:04 Going forward, with a stronger dollar, do you feel oil prices can sustain these price levels?
45 2018-04-25 23:53:52 Just as the supply and demand for oil determines the price of oil, the demand and supply for dollars determines the price of the dollar. Lower demand for dollars, increases in its supply or both reduce the value of the dollar against currencies or goods ceteris paribus.
46 2018-04-25 23:53:50 and Athena here looks really determined...empowering the woman who used the oil in this lekythos?
47 2018-04-25 23:53:49 If someone broke into my house, they'd think it was a downsized potato shop cuz of the heavy smell of potato and oil
48 2018-04-25 23:53:32 When Bennet says "clean energy" from his oily perspective that means the continued rapid extraction of fracked gas & oil. Guess we will be adding POW & Citizens Climate Lobby the "big Greens" list that engages in political expediency for "access" or ignores climate science.
49 2018-04-25 23:53:23 Excellent work! Before you go to bed tonight, mix together some salt/sugar and grapeseed oil and scrub yourself tip to toe in the shower and also do a face mask. Lifeadmin your body too
50 2018-04-25 23:53:12 refusing to feel mad or sad for more than one day, drinking tea and water only, face masks 3x a week and washing my face twice a day, applying my prescription cream and vitamin e oil at night and smoking weed is my skincare routine get ur face snatchedt yall

55 2018-04-25 23:52:03 If the fatberg is 90% cooking oil, from an energy viewpoint that is a fuel source that is completely being wasted by being, literally, flushed down the drain. #Fatberg
56 2018-04-25 23:52:01 Kendrick Perkins beard look like he got slapped in the face with oil

61 2018-04-25 23:50:56 I can’t believe the drive to and from Coachella wiped out 15% of my oil. Now my service light is on. So I gotta get an oil change soon. AND my gas tank be empty. Fuck.
62 2018-04-25 23:50:45 Going forward, Sri Lanka's market is going to be impacted strongly by liquidity stance. Our system had a liquidity hangover since 2015 & now major factors that have been impacting us are rising oil price. However our exports may witness strong growth #lka
63 2018-04-25 23:50:38 How do you make yours? Try it this way: wheat bread with olive oil and oregano toasted with bell pepper, onions and jalapeños then add the lettuce spinach tomato cucumber etc with honey mustard 
64 2018-04-25 23:50:30 I tried that castor oil all it did was make me shit myself lol but sex and walking made me go into labor but I would walk like 3 miles
65 2018-04-25 23:50:26 That’s $1300 worth of olive oil
66 2018-04-25 23:50:16 indeed
67 2018-04-25 23:50:08 Well of course the price of fuel is climbing. We regular people are getting more money thanks to tax cuts and the greed of the oil companies will take it all away.
68 2018-04-25 23:49:56 I'm buying red Palm oil because Rinny told me it helped her hair grow an inch a month

73 2018-04-25 23:48:36 We can’t let this happen. Oil & gas companies care less about our environment and wildlife. Proven fact. Look to southeastern Ohio and see how fracking is destroying our forest land. Makes me want to cry.

79 2018-04-25 23:47:53 @EPN If Mexico & the US were to legalize recreational drugs as well as get serious about investing in renewable energy sources so that they could rely less on oil, it could drastically reduce the organized crime problem in Mexico. #CCBCPOLS131
80 2018-04-25 23:47:50 I usually sit with conditioner.. then again with oil.

85 2018-04-25 23:47:29 My question for Protect Our Winters is whether you've been effectively co-opted by Sen. Bennet who is an O&G crony, promoting the rapid increase in fracked gas & oil, new fossil fuel infrastructure like KXL & DAPL & the piping CO fracked fuels to OR for export overseas?
86 2018-04-25 23:47:26 i really with there was a way to distill fog so i could mix fog smell and cypress oil
87 2018-04-25 23:47:19 If I buy a @JimmyG_10 jersey, will you let me send you some FREE beard oil? Cmon. That's a great deal.
88 2018-04-25 23:47:02 told my mum to put warm olive oil in my ear and she fucking puts in oil from the hell fire. it fucking burned my ear. someone end me it hurts so fucking much
89 2018-04-25 23:46:54 He ain't wrong though. 
90 2018-04-25 23:46:53 Which leads me to believe that Pegula is more like Jed Clampett and just lucked into his oil and gas fortune!
91 2018-04-25 23:46:31 one thing we know for sure.
when the oil boys need help, right or wrong, KOCH good ol boys will pull their stringed puppets in D.C. and that "help" will arrive.
for us non-oil boys - we get diddly squat with our needs for help.

92 2018-04-25 23:46:28 I had no idea you can get high off of cbd vape oil. Felt kinda spaced out this morning. The craziest thing it’s actually legal and only contains 0.3% of THC. Damn I’m a lightweight lol

94 2018-04-25 23:46:16 @gmbutts @RachelNotley @jjhorgan I still have to drive to work, heat my house so I'm pumping as much CO2 into the air as before. The US has doubled it's oil production, Asia is burning even more coal so CO2 levels are rising. Only difference is I'm paying for their prosperity.
95 2018-04-25 23:46:05 Albeta is God's country.  The life blood to all of Canada. In the past 5 years Alberta has sustained two of Canada's largest natural disasters and the decades of demonization towards the blood of Canada (the oil sands) is to say the least becoming burdensome.

97 2018-04-25 23:46:01 Neither have far right extreme Christians. However people evolve not all regardless of religion. You are stirring wrong hate. Part of Alberta issue in general is lack of diversity including economic one. Besides oil not much there.
98 2018-04-25 23:45:47 Lol.

Largest debt....that just got larger
Blaming countries of espionage 
A carbon tax that will economically hurt Canada
Division by race, gender, religion, province & industry
Insulting Canadians
Companies & oil rigs leaving
Lowering terrorism punishments 

Doesn’t look good
99 2018-04-25 23:45:42 If only late capitalism wasn't destroying the planet as fast as Macron or any other neo-lib can say "let's save it."  Platitudes about tomorrow won't change the fact  that oil, meat, shipping, aviation, plastic & other industries are killing the planet today.
100 2018-04-25 23:45:40 Just wait until Kanye tweets a selfie of him eating Chic fil A.
101 2018-04-25 23:45:35 No, it means that the idea of insurance has become perverted to mean all care. Insurance isn’t for car oil changes or paint on your house but for health it means coverage for your pimple!
102 2018-04-25 23:45:24 Anyone allergic to roses/sensitive to natural scents (which is rarer than my type of chemical sensitivity) is gonna have a similar reaction. Unfortunately.

I only wear my perfumes (essential oil blends) when I'm at home and don't go anywhere.

It's not worth me hurting someone.

112 2018-04-25 23:43:52 my econ teacher seriously wants me to sit down and watch a 49 MINUTE documentary on oil and answer a million questions on it im so annoyed
113 2018-04-25 23:43:49 Today I’m starting to take better care of my skin particularly my face. I deserve it! And I’m not getting any younger. So tonight I took off my eye makeup, washed my face w/oil of Olay regenerating cleanser, applied oil eliminating astringent.

125 2018-04-25 23:42:48 Yeah, I failed on that one. Managed to get the John Deere running but she’s pissing oil.
126 2018-04-25 23:42:44 I wish I got in when they said the lord gave us oil. It went up all day long.  Turned out. It was some kinda mud.  Maybe god could help musk with his assembly line.
127 2018-04-25 23:42:39 Daniella monet licks oil
128 2018-04-25 23:41:30 More seriously. I hope this marks the start of Europe playing a more serious role in ME security in post-oil era. US must re-balance to Asia as China grows. Once oil powers vanish, Europe can help balance region.

141 2018-04-25 23:40:15 I will be very precise. You and the DA are all smoke and mirrors. What happened to the disciplinary hearing? The DA may think they can mess with De Lille, but the voters will punish these snake oil salesmen.

143 2018-04-25 23:40:02 It says Spanish style, put your glasses on. Rapeseed oil is alot cheaper, contains far more Omega 3 and Vitamin E, + half the saturated fat. Its not toxic at low temps. Nutty flavour better also. If it's effecting your trade, no need to be bitter and critisise others. 
144 2018-04-25 23:39:58 Are you voting Trump next election ?
145 2018-04-25 23:39:49 Yes. Sell em snake oil n they'll drink it.
146 2018-04-25 23:39:38 It's actually astonishing 
147 2018-04-25 23:39:31 @BearWKGN @ChanceWKGN y’all mean to tell me @Russell___Smith has never changed oil? 
148 2018-04-25 23:39:28 NG is better than oil... I'll give you that. But, the problem with green infrastructure is simply the lack of it.  Predominantly, it is the lack of storage capabilities that is the most problematic. I would spend every pound(?) on solving that before drilling a single well.

151 2018-04-25 23:39:02 Oh please drew, look at you huffing and puffing. Since you’re referencing your university education you should very well know what academic freedom is. The NDP clearly support the oil and gas industry but you always try to make a partisan issue out of everything. #ableg #abpoli

153 2018-04-25 23:38:51 Trying his hardest to project what he feels will be interpreted as sincerity which is in reality is a typical snake oil salesman’s pitch that would not fool anyone. As long as he maintains the “bible bashing” pitch he feels that he is being effective. Hollow man!

169 2018-04-25 23:36:52 I actually thought the same thing for a while. I didn't know they filled the fluid everytime I got an oil change too. So when I put off getting serviced and ran out of fluid I was hella confused. Seriously I actually googled that exact thing thinking the fluid was just water.

174 2018-04-25 23:36:39 Thanks- I have peppermint oil of that sort but have not used it that way. I use it for migraines.
175 2018-04-25 23:36:16 At some point in 19th Century, al Wahaabi began a fundamentalist branch of Islam.  Sykes-Picot could have picked any Arabian tribe to rule Arabia & supply cheap oil in exchange for being elevated.  They chose Saud tribe & we've been paying heavily for that strategy. /3
176 2018-04-25 23:36:13 There’s no last ditch Stuart, the resistance here from the people has never been greater and will only build as Alberta and Big Oil continue on their strategy of bullying BC into turning Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port.
177 2018-04-25 23:35:59 Well, a couple of things: 
Congress, aka the GOP, decided:
1) oil is more precious than the environment;
2) giving 1% of the wealthiest people in the world even more wealth was a good idea;
3) no more sheltering refugees.
BTW the leader of the free world is the French president.
178 2018-04-25 23:35:50 So it's like tinder but for refined oil related satisfaction?

181 2018-04-25 23:35:20 went to work, got an oil change for my car, got new vape stuff, got some food, walked my daily 5 kilos, and got baked.

what do i do now
182 2018-04-25 23:35:11 That is so awful. Did you manage to get it off? Was it oil paint??
183 2018-04-25 23:35:09 The oil sands are the single biggest emitter of green house gas on the continent. Alberta should build the largest solar panel factory in the world instead.
184 2018-04-25 23:35:03 Not even close considering there is over 1.8 million barrels of upgraded Oilsands product a day leaving the Fort McMurray/Conklin area. This doesn’t even count the Heavy Oil output of Elk Point, Wainwright, Peace River.
185 2018-04-25 23:34:52 Yes, they are. And snake oil peddlers, they truly be, sir.
186 2018-04-25 23:34:41 wow i used peppermint oil to try and help my migraine and i do feel a little better
187 2018-04-25 23:34:35 Thanks babe  I’ve had meh DevaCuts but my girl Taylor is the best cut I’ve ever had. 
So! I have the accompanying olive oil shampoo & use it probably once a week, but I think the amount one SHs is dependent on the hair

189 2018-04-25 23:34:17 I bet if you were to travel back in time hundreds of years and interview 'witches' before they were executed, you would find out that a form of #cannabis oil along with its other products made up a large portion of their ingredients.
190 2018-04-25 23:34:00 People like you confuse the hell out of me Angela. I see you RT'd @Scottludlam's amazing piece on Jabiluka. You're clearly a soul sister. Why is someone like you going in to bat for Iraq 2.0? What happened to you people? Why are you suddenly all pro oil, war and regime change?

192 2018-04-25 23:33:40 Yes! Keep victimising cars with diesel engines and forget : railway locomotives, aircraft. industrial and domestic heating, ships, HGVs and other devices using diesel oil while putting car production down and men out of work. What a joke!
193 2018-04-25 23:33:40 Wonder if Hemp Oil crayons would have a better green? :)
194 2018-04-25 23:33:37 Also greedy Oil companies
195 2018-04-25 23:33:37 Suggesting it’s factually incorrect or coining it fake talking points, without tackling which of the many facts presented are even remotely not true is just more lobbying for big oil, without getting into the meat and potatoes of the issue, oil spills and BC FN resistance.
196 2018-04-25 23:33:30 @ProfTimOB I’ve never used beard oil.....just regular shampooing works for me
197 2018-04-25 23:33:30 Incorrect, the oil and energy industry contributes over $15Biilion in federal and provincial taxes per year.
198 2018-04-25 23:33:29 A Libra and unnecessary confrontation is like oil and water. They fly low
199 2018-04-25 23:33:27 Glad you're okay. Better story than how I had to turn around on yesterday's drive to photograph the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. Check engine light was on, normal things like oil were okay, so back I went. Deal diagnosis: loose gas cap was letting in evaporation.
200 2018-04-25 23:33:25 I'm wondering when CO voters are going to realize Sen. Bennet himself is part of the problem because he promotes polices to increase, yes increase the extraction of oil and gas; fossil fuels which are significantly contributing to climate change.
201 2018-04-25 23:33:25 I have an intense spider phobia too and my dad told me that peppermint oil diluted with water sprayed around the room helps. It saved my life tbh haven’t had a spider in my room in a year
202 2018-04-25 23:33:13 Let me get this straight. We can have a national court case over the fixing of bread prices, but we’re ok with paying $1.30/L (or way more) for gas with a $69 barrel of oil?
203 2018-04-25 23:32:46 Fossil fuel for fossilised brains
Tarsands oil for retarded economies
Pipelines for Pied Pipers

204 2018-04-25 23:32:34 Yup! It's probably heavy carbs, oil, salt, racism etc etc. Racism definitely gives headaches.
205 2018-04-25 23:32:32 But the pipeline does earn steady transportation fees. I think it would be similar to investment in the oil sands. Need to see an analysis.
206 2018-04-25 23:32:20 It's all about Russian oil
207 2018-04-25 23:32:18 I'm sure the WH Exec Chef tried it all out but it does seem odd. My mom always did roasted red potatoes in olive oil & garlic and asparagus with lamb.

210 2018-04-25 23:31:54 Pretty much by voting Sen. Bennet out of office because he promotes ramping up the production of fracked gas and oil and even exporting it overseas.
211 2018-04-25 23:31:47 .rosehip oil is the best thing I’ve done for my skin lately
212 2018-04-25 23:31:38 This lady - from Seattle! - complained to my supervisor that I had a “Satanic demeanor.” 

I only spoke to her on the phone.

Spike, hot pepper sesame oil (HPSO), nutritional yeast (nooch). Adjust levels to your preference.
217 2018-04-25 23:31:05 It was  Mustard oil that used a wrench to break the bottle of syrup
218 2018-04-25 23:30:54 It’s troubling that pump prices were at $1.25+ per litre back when oil was at $100 per barrel, and now we’re seeing the same high pump prices even though oil is less than $70 per barrel. Is it all due to the higher taxes on gasoline, especially the infamous carbon taxes?
219 2018-04-25 23:30:50 yeah, i was super amazed at it's efficacy! I did a thing with olive oil and I did a thing with a tea ball in vodka

222 2018-04-25 23:30:24 My question for you is why do you continually "greenwash" yourself when you promote fracked oil and gas, advocate for new fossil fuel infrastructure and promote export of oil and gas overseas via projects like Jordan Cove? Why do you hide the affects of this on climate change?
223 2018-04-25 23:30:19 On our home soil to peoples of all colors including the horrific treatment still ongoing to this day of our indigenous people as the US government continues their goal of genocide in order to access the oil rich tribal lands.

226 2018-04-25 23:29:57 There's nothing "bio" in the biofuels. It's just the same old internal combustion engine burning oil plants instead of crude oil. These massive palm oil field should be used to produce food instead.

229 2018-04-25 23:29:28 Personally, when Big Oil started 30 years ago trying very hard to demolish climate change science. The onset of fake news. The rest is history - well fake history clearly. Plus we have today's "proper" media cluttering up the airwaves with balance/false equivalence as well

239 2018-04-25 23:27:47 It's the standard summer's coming gas hike scenario. Gouge central is in it's normal flow. We are paying for the new pipelines plus company raises & profits to the oil companies & their leaders. Did anyone expect any less ?

274 2018-04-25 23:23:20 If the idea is that by blocking new supply we can raise the price of oil marginally, thus reducing demand - why not just raise the price directly?
275 2018-04-25 23:23:19 That sucks. I’m not sure what Volteran gel does. I use liniment for muscle spasticity, and the oddly most powerful is peppermint oil! Essential oil not the one with alcohol.  Aromatherapy kind works. I realize this may not be relevant to what you have. Best of luck.

285 2018-04-25 23:22:10 You left out oil. Can't forget about oil in North Dakota. Come on man.
286 2018-04-25 23:22:09 uh yeah mayo is pretty much only oil and eggs and lemon juice/vinegar haha. I'm not weird with any of those

288 2018-04-25 23:22:05 Wild garlic bonanza #2
Today herb and lemon breaded hake on bead of seasonal greens, wild garlic sauce and wild garlic oil.
289 2018-04-25 23:22:04 I'm far more sympathetic to the oil sands myself, as long as they're willing to accept carbon pricing. To stabilize CO2, we need to cut demand for fossil fuels; supply will follow.

304 2018-04-25 23:19:48 The cbd oil I ordered last week is on its way. I’ll report back if this does anything for me, or if like weed and melatonin, it just makes all my stuff worse!
305 2018-04-25 23:19:44 Interestingly, consequences would've gone largely unnoticed if not for Iraq war.  Removing Saddam lead to massive investment in Mideast and subsidies for fuel consumption in region to make up for lost time.  Reduced exports drove oil and food prices higher.
306 2018-04-25 23:19:24 This is all for Donald Trump's deplorables.

Trump knows that they will swallow his snake oil simply because he said it, without ever actually checking to see whether it is true or not.

311 2018-04-25 23:18:58 I have been so sleep deprived recently, my skin is descending into madness. My forehead broke out for the first time in forever, & of course one of the pimples burst & scarred.  Actively treating with oil & in the last week alone I’ve noticed it lighten visibly, but still...

325 2018-04-25 23:17:43 I disagree with him on this point. Nixon tied our dollar to oil, but that created a false value. Gold has the same value/purchasing power, our dollar does not. The new fake dollars devalue the old fake dollars. Our dollar today is worth 4% of the 1920 dollar...
326 2018-04-25 23:17:21 Our last 6 presidents invaded countries for power, greed and oil 
327 2018-04-25 23:17:14 Electric buses are hurting the oil industry via @technology: For every 1,000 battery-powered buses on the road, about 500 barrels a day of diesel fuel will be displaced from the market. #cdnpoli, #bcpoli

329 2018-04-25 23:17:03 Hillary and Bill Clinton have stole a lot of oil from Haiti, but no one cares about that.
330 2018-04-25 23:17:00 If I had $10 for everytime I heard "post Hurricane Maria" I'd be in oil.
331 2018-04-25 23:16:54 I believe that is an oil temperature gauge, not pressure.
332 2018-04-25 23:16:49 Thats an amazing statistic! If i remember correctly, China imports ~10 mbd which is ~10% of global oil production, so the semiconductor stat seems high
333 2018-04-25 23:16:37 What is this mad fellow saying? Did you drink the toilet oil mistakenly?

337 2018-04-25 23:16:11 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
338 2018-04-25 23:16:04 Vegan cheese: In Southern Lebanon women make vegan cheese or kishk el khameer bil zeit. Cracked wheat is mixed with water and salt then allowed to ferment for a week or so in a crock. It's kneaded everyday, formed into balls and stored under oil.
339 2018-04-25 23:15:41 Shitting and going blind.
340 2018-04-25 23:15:40 I'm sure that bombing sovereign nations, murdering innocents, stealing & extracting gas & oil reserves that belong to them, theft of their money & deposing their leaders aren't helping our planet at all. IT IS ALREADY IS GREAT! Stop making it worse!

347 2018-04-25 23:14:34 What I’m getting at is you can’t trust a politician on a grand scale (like a prez) to fix a couple boroughs in Chicago, Illinois - it’s been bad for almost 30 years, same with Detroit. Government has oil and taxes to worry about. Try a senator/fix gerrymandering, etc.

353 2018-04-25 23:12:56 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

356 2018-04-25 23:12:27 Can't go on for much longer, can it?
Sure, the private automobile keeps the oil execs awash in cash, but is ruining the planet so a bunch of old white men can hold you by the short and curlies really worth it?

376 2018-04-25 23:09:05 FYI Ryan positions just like this one have been receiving federal funding for years, even under more "oil & gas friendly" regimes. And they also don't have an organizational mandate that goes against the Charter protecting women's health rights, so there's that too.

384 2018-04-25 23:08:10 I have figured out the perfect long grain rice: 1.5 c rice, 2.5 c water. Sauté garlic in oil until golden brown. Remove garlic add water. Bring water to boil. Add rice. Wait for water to boil again. Bring to low, cover for 20 mins. Move off heat let rest for 5 mins. Fluff & serve
385 2018-04-25 23:08:08 Did he not add "without bombs dropping on your heads and foreign armed terrorists at your door...there can be no real profits for oil and weapons. " (libya,syria,yemen,etc)

396 2018-04-25 23:06:49 Good question. We were waiting for a weak rally,  ND near resistance is ideal.  ND bar in nature signifies that demand is spent, ergo not enough force of buying left in the market to test resistance, plus oil is volatile, has less back and forth than the S@P's

399 2018-04-25 23:06:17 Excellent point from @vsiv book. If US fails to innovate it could end up relying on imports of Chinese clean energy products "reminiscent of US dependence on foreign oil in decades past."
400 2018-04-25 23:06:15 Past Gov’s didn’t set up Canadian oil for success either. We should be refining more and be more self sustainable. Energy is the a core staple of a countries success and sovereignty. The liberals are just taking it to an epic level of failure. They are anti-Canadian energy.

413 2018-04-25 23:04:46 True, and he hasn't been enough of an accurate passer from the pocket in my opinion. And although he's had no major injury yet. He's already leaking oil from all the hits!
414 2018-04-25 23:04:43 Even if this was true thats certainly a rotten deal and not one worth defending. That being said, Daesh was armed by the US for years and their sales of oil (which funded their state) were obviously approved by US adjacent apparatuses.

435 2018-04-25 23:02:08 I literally buy the coconut oil from the dollar store and keep it in my shower. It’s great. I put it in my hair before I wash it too
436 2018-04-25 23:02:04 I like US banks I don’t own any yet.  I am still heavy oil. I have heard citi is under valued.
437 2018-04-25 23:01:55 Re. my last tweet: I would love to live in a world where there is no option to drill for oil or anything else in a nature refuge in the middle of the ocean. Why are we even discussing this?
438 2018-04-25 23:01:51 Kasoy oil reserves yours now!

Payment 1st for pre order
439 2018-04-25 23:01:38 Depends on the river. If the river is clean it's good, if it's filthy like the Mississippi to wouldn't make any difference on the size, it will still taste like 40 weight motor oil and diesel fuel.
440 2018-04-25 23:01:19 
441 2018-04-25 23:01:10 Bought some tea tree oil bcos I read its an excellent pore shrinker and now i can’t find the recipe online

448 2018-04-25 23:00:15 So my bet, the next move will be lower in yield and rates but that can happen when oil breaks lower taking PMI data with it .... a stronger dollar will help that
449 2018-04-25 23:00:11 Putting lavender oil in my burner was the best idea i’ve ever had 
450 2018-04-25 22:59:44 @newseasons Please stop using canola oil in all of your deli items. You're supposed to be about healthy; we all know this is just cheaper & Unhealthy. Plz
451 2018-04-25 22:59:36 How about you mention the oil companies ripping us consumers off by raising oil prices just because thier  fear something might happen when nothing has happened
452 2018-04-25 22:59:26 Truth i can fix my car by my own and what Her Majesty Queen did years ago in the army her car fix i too i learn it also from my mother. Always a nylon and egg in the car with it i can change a tyre lights and so on oil refill learn from @TimCoronel proud of @TheDukeOfYork.
453 2018-04-25 22:59:25 I don’t know what u do. But oil and construction are booming. Those jobs took a major hit with the last potus. It’s very simple. Let the entrepreneurs invest, jobs will come,  people will spend money witch makes more jobs repeat
454 2018-04-25 22:59:24 I’ll post pics when it’s fixed. I have coconut oil in it right now lol
455 2018-04-25 22:59:22 TRESemmé conditioner ( luxurious moisture for dry or damaged hair ) , shea butter , honey , apple cider vinegar, coconut & olive oil 
456 2018-04-25 22:59:05 I am an American. We have been fighting to go green in America but big oil won't let us. We have the technology for Blue-green algae fuel, but it get stopped. GO GREEN AMERICA! END THE MIDDLE EAST WARS!
457 2018-04-25 22:58:53 LOL. What the hell did I miss? Was editing parts of 4th book and then took a shower after a workout. This better be good. Lol.
458 2018-04-25 22:58:46 Olive oil is very effective makeup remover.  Or, honestly, any cooking oil, but EVO is cool.
459 2018-04-25 22:58:42 I much prefer to ingest it. Yes, it can be overwhelming until one gets used to it & discovers the right amt for them. I use CBD oil as well. It helps the pain w/o the high as it's derived from hemp & has little THC the psychoactive property.
460 2018-04-25 22:58:11 I take CBD oil to perform in the bedroom
461 2018-04-25 22:58:11 Gasoline is priced on the world market in USD.  When oil was above 100 bucks a barrel, the CAN/US exchange rate was at or near par.  We import most of our gas.  Today, the exchange rate is around 77 cents.  That's a 23% mark up due solely to the exchange rate.
462 2018-04-25 22:58:06 To be fair it was no more far fetched than Reagan thinking he broke communism....

Nothing to do with opec driving the oil price through the floor, it was a batshit mental B movie actor....
463 2018-04-25 22:57:58 Keep up the fight brother! I'm sure you're busy aware of CBD oil, but look into Vitamin B17 + hydrogen peroxide therapy. Might find some useless non traditional therapies and as I believe traditional radiation destroys ALL cells in your body.
464 2018-04-25 22:57:57 I take it you'll be backing this fuckwit now... probably get some free trainers off him and off load some snake oil.
465 2018-04-25 22:57:55 Ooooooohhhhh..........more felted goodness made in Rumney! Jane Pappe has brought her painterly style oil paintings that showcase our beautiful area!
466 2018-04-25 22:57:55 I was in the extraction business for almost 40 yrs.  That's how it usually ended up.  Take away the oil company subsidies and make them clean up as fast as they dig and i am pretty sure the pipeline issue would disappear.

468 2018-04-25 22:57:46 Racial profiling? Someone yelling “chemical weapons” at the right time and place is enough for Western pundits. They are prepared to believe anything about Arabs. After all, they have oil and ‘we’ need it!
469 2018-04-25 22:57:41 My proposed bill #675stardate27546 on Van control:
1.all van should have a limit capacity of fuel from 10gl to ½ gallon per.
2all van are ban to have sliding side doors
3.when in use it should be lock put inside a lock safe cabin.
4.things should be emptied oil,fuel&coolant
470 2018-04-25 22:57:21 Grape seed oil. I need that
471 2018-04-25 22:57:19 Flat smells of peppermint oil. Apparently it will keep the mouse at bay. Eeck!
472 2018-04-25 22:57:03 Oh I know sir, we use that.  I’m talking Rick Simpson THC oil. They have half cbd/thc that would ease the pain better.  Unfortunately I’m in A dead-zone state.
473 2018-04-25 22:56:56 It turns out that the 75% THC hash oil I’ve been chain smoking all day like a mental patient isn’t bunk.

476 2018-04-25 22:56:44 No. It can be pore clogging. There are many oils that are beneficial for the face and even fight acne such as sweet almond oil
477 2018-04-25 22:56:40 Solo os digo una cosa: Miedo me da que compliquen el pulpo de Oil Ocean o el nuevo Metal Sonic en el modo Encore xD Pero a la vez estoy listo para darles por el culo.
478 2018-04-25 22:56:39 .@David_Benac "Why are we invading foreign countries for oil, when we have unlimited renewable energy here? #createthechange @AlleganDems
479 2018-04-25 22:56:30 My understanding is thus: Trump pulls out the rug from under Iran, iran is Shackled and can't sell their oil in the open market, but Russia can and will profit greatly
Wouldn't this make Putin and Trump extremely happy. Trump will always take care of Russian and we all know why
480 2018-04-25 22:56:29 Me personally? I just *clears throat* smoke the flower. My mom uses the oil/cream on her surgically repaired neck and loves it!
481 2018-04-25 22:56:20 Look at the 10  month time frame in your original chart. You can put straight line fits that form a nice "X". Dollar went from 99 to 90. Oil went from 45 to 68. Time frame matters.
482 2018-04-25 22:56:08 Saying "Pfft, it was only my hands that cooked" really doesn't make it sound any better, does it?

All you turkey frying people be safe, 4 gallons of hot peanut oil + open flame is very unforgiving.
483 2018-04-25 22:56:00 "any powers of fiscal value" , one only needs to read the McCrone report to see why - its wanst warning about oil wealth , but a competitor for the dominance of Westminster unable to argue "broad shoulders" and subsidy anymore.
484 2018-04-25 22:55:56 If the world goes green, all the oil wars will cease. There will be PEACE in the Middle East and no need for an anti-christ.

488 2018-04-25 22:55:24 Four score and seven years ago, back when IRA’s were becoming popular, an oil ponzi prospector was calling on Baton Rouge lawyers asking for a $25,000 donation... I had some money at the time, so I agreed to review a copy of his “business plan”...
489 2018-04-25 22:55:17 Our domestic pricing is Driven by the Americans. Canada Has No domestic Oil price separate from our neighbours. Thanks again to NAFTA.
490 2018-04-25 22:55:13 I take CBD oil, my dosage is 25mg and it helps me sleep. I've also felt it helps with inflammation. But this is all just anecdotal. I would believe that a smaller molecule would be absorbed faster, but not with greater impact.
491 2018-04-25 22:55:12 Alison Stinely utilizes various types of sculpting in collaboration with oil painting in order to create impactful pieces that are independent of a traditional frame. Stinely's work exudes a breath of life that it is everlasting, fantastical, and honest #williamsburgva
492 2018-04-25 22:55:06 Truth or Dare  but my car just blew a major oil leak so my plans are now up in the air again :(

495 2018-04-25 22:54:36 We export oil now.. like it or not that is what moves vehicles do u think other countries should get rich while we play by rules that make our country poorer?
496 2018-04-25 22:54:31 I paid $50 to get my oil changed instead of getting a pedicure. I don’t like this adulting thing.
497 2018-04-25 22:54:21 Fuck these gas prices man let’s hope this bitch can run off canola oil
498 2018-04-25 22:53:48 Whoa. My seasoning instructions are always like "Hey put oil on it and heat it up for 30 seconds to a minute."

I've never had a cast iron skillet though.
499 2018-04-25 22:53:37 Wage growth has bee flat in Oz. Cost of living has increased marginally. Cost of petrol up up up. No wonder people are considering electric cars now. They are sick of being gouged by OPEC and oil companies.

501 2018-04-25 22:53:18 Personally am into coconut oil, I usually massage it into my scalp, leave it for 30min then rinse it out in the shower
502 2018-04-25 22:53:00 But when shit was dry... Nigga!  Was no water or oil on sight.  Shit used to be corny.
503 2018-04-25 22:52:59 Stock market is looking dangerous this year. Too much volatility caused by Trump, superstition, oil price rise, inflation and threats of interest rate hikes.
504 2018-04-25 22:52:54 That's right...keep shoving oil down the throats of babes. Hypocrite!
505 2018-04-25 22:52:50 Yesterday** me: "you should probably change your oil, it's about that time"

513 2018-04-25 22:52:10 Oil from your hair will get onto your pillowcase as you sleep, so change your pillowcases weekly to avoid sleeping on oil all night long.
514 2018-04-25 22:51:59 For what it is worth, your videos have shown me a side of Shenzhen I didn't know existed. It's cool now! Because of you I feel more comfortable doing business there. You are a great ambassador to your city. Add oil.
515 2018-04-25 22:51:47 US is flooding the overseas markets with oil, but we are paying the price. Big oil baby

517 2018-04-25 22:51:44 And of course the usual oil change but that’s no biggie
518 2018-04-25 22:51:42 This activist traveled the country, colluding with foreign funded, anti Canadian oil activists and other special interest groups to overthrow the Conservative government in 2015. He elected Trudeau and deserves no reward or positive credit from anyone.

535 2018-04-25 22:48:08 Don't kniw, but highly doubt that. This place is loaded with mansions from oil booms in 20s and 80s. I worked for a cable TV pioneer who had a French mansion that he put on market for $10m about 10 years ago.

539 2018-04-25 22:47:46 Oil pipelines, tanker traffic, oil transport by rail, the environment, the economy, rights of FN people, Feds vs BC the noise overwhelms
540 2018-04-25 22:47:36 The only surprise in this for me, was that the family wanted to go to Italy for snake oil, rather than the US. It's usually the US anti-science mob behind this kind of 'outrage'.
541 2018-04-25 22:47:33 I don’t doubt it for a minute given the level of corruption we have seen, and the depths the oil companies will go to, to strip wealth and resources from the State. I suspect they are the worse, but undoubtedly more.
542 2018-04-25 22:46:47 You tell them Joni! Someone has to protect the RFS! Trump, if you’re for biofuels and agriculture, send Pruitt packing back to his “Big Oil” friends!
543 2018-04-25 22:46:41 The car dramatically improved with full synthetic and a high flow oil filer.  Car seems to run well now.  Poor oem specs
544 2018-04-25 22:46:41 Take some of those guts and get your pops to rethink marijuana stance.  My dad is sick and that oil would help but cant risk 2-4year sentence if caught.
545 2018-04-25 22:46:41 Ok @SecretaryZinke - big, big attaboy on North Cascades grizzly restoration decision. But - please think seven times before you accept keynote speaker at North Dakota oil conference. Terrible optics! #saveouroutdoors

549 2018-04-25 22:45:00 Chevy recommend oil is clearly wrong. Now that I run the car on fullsynthetic and a high flow oil filter it runs great, the oem recommendations are really poorly made.  It’s actually a fun little car to drive now that tiny turbo is actually able to boost.  Before it was a turd
550 2018-04-25 22:44:53 Tea tree oil.
551 2018-04-25 22:44:43 If US oil is in fact flooding Europe, how about US oil floods America too. Pres Trump needs to do something about the rising gas prices at the pumps. Why not let America benefits first.
552 2018-04-25 22:44:31 Oh yeah facts lmao. I think synthetic oil is the best tho.
553 2018-04-25 22:44:28 "Those people in the west were scum and mutants. They were asked nicely multiple times to assist us but they didn't. The whole vault 13 thing was from them not complying. They were safe on the oil rigs and we're perfectly fine. It was a modifies fev that killed mutants."

566 2018-04-25 22:42:50 Arabs and their olive oil remedies 
567 2018-04-25 22:42:37 It issssss. But don't forget to exfoliate per usual (gently), and wrap up with a cold rinse to close up your pores. And stay moisturised, with a nice oil to lock things in.
568 2018-04-25 22:42:34 Put olive oil on everything, no cardio, more milk, calorie dense foods, more carbs. Find your maintenance calories, then eat 1000 more calories than that every day.
569 2018-04-25 22:42:32 Ok... Let us keep our oil and gas then.
And while we are at it why don't we stop sending all our agricultural produce south.

571 2018-04-25 22:42:16 Unfortunately, I doubt it. They've been systematically neutered as a society for the last 60 years.
572 2018-04-25 22:42:15 Also put to much body oil in the bath it’s like a damn slip and slide.
573 2018-04-25 22:42:04 My migraines are triggered by weather changes and it's been a rough couple months. Weed and CBD oil are essential for managing pain and nausea.
574 2018-04-25 22:42:00 A full Attitude Era show on Friday would be the best swerve ever. Probably result in an oil embargo though.
575 2018-04-25 22:41:58 So my mum just walked in on me putting on baby oil on my body cause it takes tan off and she honestly just starts screaming at me that I better not be taking pictures  like that , like why is that her first thought
576 2018-04-25 22:41:50 That was an unbelieveable series and amazing upset by you guys!! Will remember if forever!  Voting for Edm Oil Kings.  ps- miss you Curtis - Oil Kings grandma haha
577 2018-04-25 22:41:45 We never got sick and I’m not dead so.....I mean it works. & she wouldn’t reuse it for a crazy long time or anything but she’d get at 3 or 4 uses out of one pot of oil before she dumped it.
578 2018-04-25 22:41:19 I got really emotional bc I’d run out of olive oil 2nite
579 2018-04-25 22:41:13 And don’t wash you hair so often it strips hair from natural oils that causes lack of hair growth just rinse and condition... and I put castor oil on my roots. Just a little so your hair won’t be grease..
580 2018-04-25 22:40:55 coconut oil on the face before bed is a must
581 2018-04-25 22:40:44 Try hemp oil bro
582 2018-04-25 22:40:43 My dad FaceTimed me once while I applied chapstick and literally gave me a 20 minute lecture on how I should save my money and just use olive oil lmao what
583 2018-04-25 22:40:28 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
584 2018-04-25 22:40:26 The trouble is.  It is economics tactics.    Petrol tax is better then diesel.   People were buying more diesel.  Lost revenue in low petrol tax.   So now diesel is bad.  Shift to petrol.  Oil tax on import for petrol is better.
585 2018-04-25 22:40:23 Auto workers, oil workers, firemen, and policemen are allowed to go on strike but teachers are not? Maybe they should just quit and get private sector jobs making 2-2 1/2 times what a teacher makes. Probably better working conditions too.
586 2018-04-25 22:40:15 Yesso. #teamtobi the rich peepz. Broke ass lmao. That's why you couldn't bring out 3k to vote Bamteddy. Hope you at least but her toilet oil, oh sorry you can't afford it.
587 2018-04-25 22:40:14 cotton candy. or oil spill.

590 2018-04-25 22:40:03 Y’all my roommates don’t save cooking oil. They use it one time and throw it away. Is this common practice or something cause my mom would reuse the hell out of some oil. Strain that shit and keep it moving lol

592 2018-04-25 22:39:40 Harper actively advertised the Oil Sands Companies in Europe and elsewhere. He acted as their employee and used tax money to pay the expenses. Was that 'free speech'?
593 2018-04-25 22:39:34 4円RT
594 2018-04-25 22:39:03 Never buy beard oil from Spartan Man via Shopify. It's not acceptable for a purchase made on April 6th to ship out on April 25th. Let's stop allowing that to be normal for online businesses.
595 2018-04-25 22:38:50 "Stop hugging me you smell like engine oil" -My Mom
596 2018-04-25 22:38:50 My @Uber driver seriously just stopped for gas after stopping for oil. I deserve a discount or refund. Ridiculous
597 2018-04-25 22:38:49 #FreebieFriday #Win this amazing hamper and more to enter follow @EAT_17 & @sgftv & re-tweet the #competition by 6pm next friday  the hamper includes wine, jam, cook book, olive oil and more
598 2018-04-25 22:38:48 This is SICKENING how BIG OIL, CORPORATIONS, in general CONTINUES their CORRUPTION and flaunts the law SINCE THEY HAVE THE MONEY to avoid FINES AND JAIL time....
599 2018-04-25 22:38:45 It is difficult to get that forest back. Even taking oil sands out of the factor. Forest recovery is a long-term process.
600 2018-04-25 22:38:43 I guess these protesters have no idea our Canada Pension is invested in oil & gas companies - shooting themselves in the foot if they want that pension when eligible!
601 2018-04-25 22:38:31 my forehead literally produces A LOT of oil
602 2018-04-25 22:38:31 Yep, I wish cheap soybean oil wasn’t in everything.  Yuck!
603 2018-04-25 22:38:29 I bought Blistex. It's relatively cheap, but I'd prefer something with natural ingredients. Every brand of natural lip balm I've found uses sunflower seed oil, though. Lol I guess I could just slather my lips with olive oil or coconut oil and call it a day.
604 2018-04-25 22:38:25 And when oil went from 120 to 40, did gas go from 1.20 to .40? It's all a big corporate racket to get the price as high as possible, summer season is basically here and it's time to get the price up
605 2018-04-25 22:37:57 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
606 2018-04-25 22:37:51 Again, you deny the fact that #climatechange is real and the world is moving away from fossil fuels and oil. China is starting to make the move to #GreenEnergy and rely less on coal. Oil dependent economies are diversifying. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
607 2018-04-25 22:37:49 How can a country run only on Oil and gas revenue? Are these guys so daft that they can’t think?
608 2018-04-25 22:37:40 Cheaper than the beard oils from the shops that’s for sure  I just went on google and typed “how to make own beard oil” 
609 2018-04-25 22:37:35 Louisville area it happen because of Derby and  the oil refinery are switching to the summer blend of gas
610 2018-04-25 22:37:26 Someone tried to trick me with palm oil ghee. It was utterly nasty.
611 2018-04-25 22:37:24 Sweet almond oil for acne scars works wonders!
612 2018-04-25 22:37:16 This is my favorite When I was a kid I watched this so many times-  I like when he was like ok -   Drain out all the water, take in plenty of oil, grease up that back end, get out on the highway and go at full speed for about ten miles. See how it feels.
613 2018-04-25 22:37:13 Tom Petrie, Petrie Partners, says global oil demand is now virtually matching global supply.#DUGRockies
614 2018-04-25 22:37:05 Wonder how many humans this crazy bitch has in her stomach.
615 2018-04-25 22:36:55 the US imperialism, the banker's war, the big oil ... It will be 3.9 world wars in the coming days or months.
616 2018-04-25 22:36:52 Venezuela suffers from an acute version of the same shit happening here. Socialism didn't create those problems, an authoritarian govt mismanaging own responsibilities did, exactly the same thing happening here, but sped up there by collapse of oil, the cornerstone of their econ.
617 2018-04-25 22:36:48 Someones cooking with so much oil rn i can smell it in my house & im disgusted 
618 2018-04-25 22:36:45 Black Castor Oil
619 2018-04-25 22:36:44 Worldwide, people use an estimated 1 trillion plastic bags, which equates to 100 million barrels of oil. Approximately 380 billion of those bags are from the U.S. #plasticfree #polution #Recycle
620 2018-04-25 22:36:36 Ouch .. this is the highest in Canada I believe .. or maybe Victoria .. oil producing Canada ?

622 2018-04-25 22:36:17 moisturizer can't penetrate into your skin after oil. Oil seals it all in.
623 2018-04-25 22:35:49 For five points I’m going with anointing with Holy Oil and the presentation of the manifestation of crowned sovereignty.
624 2018-04-25 22:35:33 Jeff Bezos and Amazon need to get into the gas retailing business and stick it to the oil crooks. We need some good disrupters in this industry right now to end the Rockefeller style robbery today. Electric vehicles are not practical and affordable enough yet.
625 2018-04-25 22:35:24 Oil, whisky, lamb, beef, salmon, Gold and other precious metals, Electronics, gas turbines and machinery to name but few
626 2018-04-25 22:35:12 How to cook dinner:
- chop onions and garlic
- sauté them in olive oil

627 2018-04-25 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
628 2018-04-25 22:35:07 Cost of oil is going up
629 2018-04-25 22:34:56 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
630 2018-04-25 22:34:44 Bones don’t turn to oil
631 2018-04-25 22:34:34 Bein stuck on the 91 while smokin a raw wit hash oil/keef & listening to 88.7 is something else. .
632 2018-04-25 22:34:28 Full tank of gas, fresh oil change, new filter & a car wash? Boy - I might take a road trip somewhere lol
633 2018-04-25 22:34:20 At the end of "The Return Of The King," Elves, Dwarfs, Bilbo, Frodo & Gandolf of the Fellowship Of The Ring were transported to a "better" world for melting the Ring Of Power. Does The Prime Twerp think that he is Frodo. The oil sands then, are his Mordor, which HE must destroy.
634 2018-04-25 22:34:19 My 8th-grade English teacher, Mrs. Schlanker, taught me to diagram sentences. She also introduce s me to then idwa of staying up late to work harder and make an essay better. I can still hear her saying: “You could always burn the midnight oil on this one, you know.”
635 2018-04-25 22:34:18 Picking on suburbs in Colorado now, oil-and-gassholes? I guess you got tired of New York not giving a shit what you say about it. 
636 2018-04-25 22:34:11 Gotta love the consistency of the NDP...... this one wants to shut down any advocacy not Pro Oil but the NDP in BC won’t allow the new pipeline. Complete lunacy that higher learning has to be pro oil!
637 2018-04-25 22:34:00 Two drops of kimmeridge oil are reading LSE. 
One says to the other “ I don’t understand the anger with the delay of a couple of weeks, I have been waiting 152 million years to be freed.”
638 2018-04-25 22:33:51 Quinoa cilantro kale spinach black garlic pepper with peanut oil from scratch
639 2018-04-25 22:33:49 How dare you try and put Canadian oil workers out of jobs and use their money to fund it This is treason
640 2018-04-25 22:33:44 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
641 2018-04-25 22:33:35 just had a screaming match over freaking canola oil, mom get a grip
642 2018-04-25 22:33:26 If there are any rum lovers among the cocktail set, I would suggest trying a Corn ‘n Oil. That is a classic…
643 2018-04-25 22:33:23 yes it is
644 2018-04-25 22:33:23 We claim we have oil, but 100% of Nigerias budget is been based on oil. Mumu presidio.
645 2018-04-25 22:33:01 I got on like 1.5 ounces of tea tree oil but it smell like 15 ounces
646 2018-04-25 22:32:40 Let’s just say that I am not impressed at the size of the shower gel and shampoo I bought from Young living essential oil’s kid sent line considering together for only two products I paid $35!!!! This shit better be gold
647 2018-04-25 22:32:35 ^^
648 2018-04-25 22:32:32 Absolutely! Light layer of olive oil on the top and sides (fat cap trimmed on bottom trimmed down to roughly a quarter inch), and rubbed with a 50/50 mix of kosher salt and coarse ground pepper. Set your Egg for indirect cooking, and heat to 250 degrees with wood chips/chunks
649 2018-04-25 22:32:27 Conservatives: universities can't be a safe space, blah blah free speech.

Also conservatives: no honorary degree for David Suzuki because that makes oil companies sad.

650 2018-04-25 22:32:24 I’ve only been using tea tree shampoo/conditioner & oil & my hair has grown so much in just like 2 weeks
651 2018-04-25 22:32:23 Trudeau’s liberals give grants to ppl who want to basically put people out of work & to deny 31 First Nations millions in $ , to loose a7 bill $ investment of KM’s on money We already shipping oil south at a loss This gonna costs us Billions
652 2018-04-25 22:32:15 You take my husband taxes and use it to pay people to protest oil jobs How dare you How bloody dare you People have had ENOUGH !
653 2018-04-25 22:32:02 Surely, we gonna use all the Oil Money to buy warplanes!

Says who?
654 2018-04-25 22:32:02 45. That high mileage oil change a fool.
655 2018-04-25 22:31:57 Ooohh! Very hush-hush! Have fun! Im off to feed my ferrets - they love sardine but will only eat from my hand -  messy. Then the g.pigs squeak for greens then my Owls get fed then i crawl into bed about 0400am. Worst thing about animals that squeak is you cant oil them!
656 2018-04-25 22:31:54 Oil Firefly
657 2018-04-25 22:31:37 Oh, I get it - let’s not look for environmentally safe ways to get the natural gas and oil out of the ground so:

We can follow the Hussein plan of putting Americans out of work.

Go back to being reliant upon Saudi Arabia and other counties  that use the oil money to kill us.
658 2018-04-25 22:31:34 This girl went to work in the oil fields to save money and get breast and booty implants priorities!
659 2018-04-25 22:31:33 私も(*＾Å＾*)
660 2018-04-25 22:31:11 When you realize OBJ/Atiku left no foreign debt at the close of their administration, you tend towards cursing GEJ/Buhari for this present economic hardship. Despite all the oil boom in the Jonathan's era, foreign reserves was totally depleted...
661 2018-04-25 22:31:10 add some tea tree oil to ur moisturizer if u wanna minimize chances of mosquito bites

664 2018-04-25 22:30:22 Nothing better than fresh oil in your car
665 2018-04-25 22:30:17 Yep. Euro looks weak and stretched € / $ positioning will start to unwind, esp if oil falls. 

Carry trade is already unwinding as dollar liquidity contracts. I think the rally has legs
666 2018-04-25 22:30:08 Yes it is the term “snake oil salesman” when referring to someone’s life work that bothers me. There are great points that I think we all would benefit from a good discussion about rather than offhand remarks.I do appreciate the thread generated but would prefer 2-sided dialogue.
667 2018-04-25 22:30:07 Can you start a car without engine oil?
668 2018-04-25 22:29:56 Once this project became about shipping oil through Metro Vancouver by increasing oil tanker shipments by 7 times, the whole project was doomed. So much opportunity to strengthen domestic supply for the LM and Pacific North West gambled and lost over greed to sell to Asia.
669 2018-04-25 22:29:55 Oil is finite...
670 2018-04-25 22:29:27 Is this entire day because I had the oil changed in my car?
671 2018-04-25 22:29:21 Y’all definitely should NOT be putting coconut oil on your skin. It’s too dense and will clog those pores. Go for a lighter oil
672 2018-04-25 22:29:19 Concerned that I’ve lost my fish oil tablets in the bed somewhere ...
673 2018-04-25 22:29:11 Nice try Dude!Who do U think is fighting to take away legal Marijuana?Who is trying to take away healthcare & destroy the @VAVetBenefits Who is trying to kill our environment/allow Oil Co to drill in our Oceans?Who is protecting the TRAITORS in DC? It’s NOT the Dems. Move 2 Texas
674 2018-04-25 22:28:53 Absolutely the reasoning of everyone at the EPA and  Interior Department hired by Trump and of Big Oil company executives, despite their disingenuous ads on TV about alternative energy investments. #climatechange
675 2018-04-25 22:28:50 What's that you say? You desire Oil this weekend? Well you are in luck!! Live at @shredderboise , @DogsintheFight1 album release/tour kick off this Saturday April 28th! Show starts at 7!!! This is a can't miss show!

679 2018-04-25 22:28:09 @steeletalk so if there have been no spills on the BC coast why don’t the people who make all he money off selling the oil agree to underwrite the costs of any future spill?  Is the answer because Alberta can’t afford to take the chance and are sticking it to BC
680 2018-04-25 22:27:50 Baby oil? Isn't it a bit young to be given that much responsibility?
681 2018-04-25 22:27:45 Pretty sure the world is moving on from fossil fuels and oil. #bcpoli #abpoli #skpoli #cdnpoli #protecttheinlet #StopKM

683 2018-04-25 22:27:31 You, Dyab Abou Jahjah, you are poring oil on the blazing 'fire' by tweeting this.
684 2018-04-25 22:27:23 Why do #channel4 not have a separate pile for #fatberg sanitary towels or comment on damage done by applicators in #fatbergautopsy or measure estrogen in sewage or ask who throws most oil & wipes down the loo? #feministfatberg #everdaysexism #SecretsOfTheSewers @guardian @theSun
685 2018-04-25 22:27:12 What r you trying to say ? That the drop from 100$ /barrel prices to 40$ barrel price happened due to Iranian oil. Are you saying that Iran produced 50% of world's oil output, and all of that came in last 3 years into the market ? Are we supposed to believe it.  ?
686 2018-04-25 22:27:10 The last time gas was this high in Ottawa I do believe a barrel of oil was more than $100. |It is nowhere near that now.  Bottom line - the government is taxing us to the hilt.   It is time to rebel.
687 2018-04-25 22:27:00 HUR & DGOC - Loving this oil investing lark 


688 2018-04-25 22:26:56 Yes, i hope there wont, but until the world realizes this, they can play that game and sell oil at this price level
689 2018-04-25 22:26:26 Damn!! Ain gone lie I gas up 3 times a week now shit ridiculous ..for my oil changed and it’s not difference
690 2018-04-25 22:26:18 Hold still Zeke. I'll get it off with some cotton wool and baby oil.
691 2018-04-25 22:26:05 Oil.
692 2018-04-25 22:25:43 I disagree city’s attack is incomparable to Real and then PSG have a whole oil drum name cavani on top and tbh Sane tear up the PL in his second season with 10+ goals and assists and YPOTY ... but like I said WC is in 2 months ... then we’ll see who doing it on the biggest stage
693 2018-04-25 22:25:41 I made my own with almond oil and lavender lol seki
694 2018-04-25 22:25:16 I'm just learning about this myself, but since oil is purchased in dollars, the sheer magnitude of those dollars leaving the country must be enough to slam the value of the USD... maybe it's like the equivalent of selling off USDs?
695 2018-04-25 22:25:15 Can’t help but wonder.  Won’t this rushed expansion of their oil and gas Industry require environmental approval of additional pipeline and port capacity to get their products to world markets( SUCH AS CANADA)! ...And where are the protestors?
696 2018-04-25 22:25:12 My hair is an oil slick. I need to start on a good dry shampoo.
697 2018-04-25 22:25:07 London, stop flushing condoms, baby wipes and cooking oil down lavs and sinks.
You absolute nutters

703 2018-04-25 22:24:15 I AM SO ANNOYED
704 2018-04-25 22:24:14 No...not unless it’s used as a carrier oil in liquid form for another essential oil. There are much better oils for the face.
705 2018-04-25 22:24:12 For those that don’t follow the industry, a very large part of the super light shale oil produced here cannot be refined at that many refineries outside the U.S.  Crude oil is not a homogenous product, not at all.
706 2018-04-25 22:24:10 I accidentally got peppermint oil in my eyes and it was literally the worst

708 2018-04-25 22:24:06 Hi. My name is Lily and I’m obsessed with smoked sardines canned in olive oil... Don’t judge me.
709 2018-04-25 22:24:03 Daerahnya bagus, Aceh Timur. Backarc basin, jelas menyimpan banyak oil and gas reserves. Bahkan masuk WK migas Pertamina EP dan deket sama WK migas Medco juga. Semoga tidak terjadi hal seperti itu lagi kedepannya, sedih baca beritanya sampe menimbulkan korban, kerugian dan trauma
710 2018-04-25 22:23:59 Gabey baby can go easy on the oil tonight.
711 2018-04-25 22:23:45 InfoChip's rugged #RFID tag carriers can withstand extreme temperatures, exposure to #oil, chemicals, water, dust & other contaminants.
712 2018-04-25 22:23:42 Hilary would mix w/ the Abbots like oil & water. U must be blind as hell
713 2018-04-25 22:23:42 Maybe some will head to work at Alaska's new oil rush dubbed The Willow Discovery. Like your daughter, Willow, the area must be gorgeous.  Since Bristol is named after the salmon-rich Bristol Bay, looks like your girls' names have some luck. Wait for a Piper diamond or gold vein
714 2018-04-25 22:23:16 From white rubber to chicken oil rubber rip
715 2018-04-25 22:23:10 pretty sure the 21st century needs oil
716 2018-04-25 22:22:48 Jamie olive oil
717 2018-04-25 22:22:43 Seems like oil prices are going back to 100-ish.. with gas over 4$/gallon those highway homes become much less attractive. Arguably it was the gas spike that crashed the house of cards last time.
718 2018-04-25 22:22:40 CBD oil *sighs
719 2018-04-25 22:21:52 Retweeted Tweetalite (@Tweetalites):

seems that they don’t need those refineries. why repairing them if the oil is shipped to South- China new refineries? #Venezuela #china #russia those two are really really really playing a good game.
720 2018-04-25 22:21:33 The majority of Canadians would like to see us phase out oil. Get with the times, Cons! We can’t keep stalling on environmental action
721 2018-04-25 22:21:27 Had an issue w/ a lawn sprinkler head that failed to retract. To avoid a costly repair, Maria from Smitty’s Sprinklers suggested that I lube it w/ olive oil. Thanks for the tip! #custserv #InsiderKnowledge
722 2018-04-25 22:21:21 The oil company I worked at sent me a flower arrangement for getting accepted into the nursing program and invited me to dinner 
723 2018-04-25 22:21:13 The photo finish comes in oil, water spray and a gel. I like them all lmao
724 2018-04-25 22:21:12 From my days on the RR, I can’t count the number of times I had to wipe off the locomotive fuel tank where some mouth breather had written “impeach Obama “ in the dirt and oil that coated the tank.
725 2018-04-25 22:21:04 I guess you forgot the part when oil caused Canada and Alberta's economies tank and jobs to be lost. Conservatives need to stop living in the 19th century and start moving into the 21st century with everyone else. #bcpoli #abpoli #skpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet
726 2018-04-25 22:21:03 Love getting mesages like this. I have a friend who was using other brands of CBD Oil but wanted to try my HempWorx brand. Well... she tried it and she loves it!!!  #HempWorx #WorldsPurestCBD 
Thanks for trusting me friend. 
727 2018-04-25 22:21:00 The biggest oil tanker you could use through the Burrard Inlet is an Aframax tanker capable of being loaded to 550 000 barrels, okay for short hauls along the coast but not competitive with tankers sailing with 2 Million barrels to Asia.
728 2018-04-25 22:20:59 i walked in the vape shop for new oil and walked out with a new vape 
729 2018-04-25 22:20:56 I had oil explode in my face like 3 weeks ago and luckily only one bit got stuck to my face but unluckily its like a little tear drop by my eye which is still scarred and I’m here still looking like Lil Wayne
730 2018-04-25 22:20:55 I drink lots of water. Believe it or not it keeps your nails strong af. And I also rub coconut oil, tea tree oil on my nails and cuticles. (I also heard rolling weed helps your nails grow lol probably why they so damn long now)
731 2018-04-25 22:20:47 What did it say? It’s been deleted.
732 2018-04-25 22:20:43 She is absolutely annoying af
733 2018-04-25 22:20:19 I get my trustworthy oil news from the elephant

735 2018-04-25 22:19:54 And when you are shaving try to mix a foam type shaving cream and baby oil or cocoa butter ... i wouldn’t lead y’all wrong
736 2018-04-25 22:19:41 Should you use coconut oil on your face? Answer below 
737 2018-04-25 22:19:32 Thanks! But WHY don’t all pharmacies have to take back the drugs just like stores that sell motor oil have to take back used oil “Free of Charge”!
738 2018-04-25 22:19:21 It’s not officially hot until my coconut oil has liquified
739 2018-04-25 22:19:12 Oil.
740 2018-04-25 22:19:09 Palm oil sellers don't care about the white dashiki wearer among them.
741 2018-04-25 22:19:02 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
742 2018-04-25 22:18:53 Bullshit u must obey your boss Rothschild at Genie oil . Finish Assad , finish Russia, finish Iran so they can pipe stolen Syrian gas to Europe , block Russian gas control Europe engergy with Genie gas and USA shale
743 2018-04-25 22:18:48 Which direction think causality goes? I think we discussed before that as oil goes down, lower supply of dollars to be sold from all the foreigners were buying oil from, pushing up $.
744 2018-04-25 22:18:47 And what I showed in my chart since the mid-2017 increase in oil prices is that any apparent correlation is transient and largely in the mind of the beholder IMHO.
745 2018-04-25 22:18:25 But our budget is still being placed on 100% barrel of oil. Una just too dumb.

748 2018-04-25 22:18:07 Cool, EiD! Looks like you got more ad $ out of those nasty old oil co's. 
But c'mon, guys. "Global elites"? It still snows in Colorado so it's all good?
Thanks for #KeepItInTheGround & #fracking but let's add #ExxonKnew just for fun, shall we?
749 2018-04-25 22:18:03 Well, usually in a frying pan with oil. Beef liver will be like a steak. Chicken liver will fall apart and become mushy. So beef (or calf) liver is good. Served with lots of salt. And fried onions are great with it. Can cook them together in same pan.
750 2018-04-25 22:18:01  go and drink olive oil
751 2018-04-25 22:17:49 Barnet a share from whole of UK paid for partly with oil money. If Scotland were independent, we wouldn’t be giving e every penny of oil money to Westminster! Why else does Westminster want us?
752 2018-04-25 22:17:46 Take 5 oil change is NOT 5 minutes.
753 2018-04-25 22:17:41 I'd hate to taste non-virgin olive oil
754 2018-04-25 22:17:39 Lathered up in coconut oil in my front yard, HMU for address
755 2018-04-25 22:17:31 I am so unbelievably confused at how this is such a well funded competition/festival... Is there an underground olive oil scene I know nothing about?
756 2018-04-25 22:17:28 The role of visual experience in the Ajil and Balad oil fields, northern Iraq
757 2018-04-25 22:17:17 Came to get an oil change at this European place & they’re giving me a car wash for free 
758 2018-04-25 22:17:14 Also Colony Grill in Fairfield with the hot pepper oil @jonlovett
759 2018-04-25 22:17:06 But where's the prevarication in that? :) But I'm thinking clouds out the back door with oil pastels.
760 2018-04-25 22:17:01 Chef Ramses cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with hot sauce.
761 2018-04-25 22:16:29 By the sounds of it.. She has..
762 2018-04-25 22:16:26 Not with a very small amount of oil on a low heat. When it comes to texture I desipe olives, beans, and mushrooms.
763 2018-04-25 22:16:17 They have oil money
764 2018-04-25 22:15:49 Did you know maintenance on an electric car is practically non-existent? Yep. The first scheduled maintenance on the Chevrolet Bolt is at 150,000 miles. Why? No engine, no oil changes, no transmission. Less parts, less problems. #cleanpower
765 2018-04-25 22:15:48 his fuckboy vibes just ooze out of him like oil, I hated him the moment he showed up and he done went and proved me right
766 2018-04-25 22:15:44 And Don't Come At Me With How You Have "Saved My Life And This Nation" By Murdering People So Rothschild Could Steal Their Oil And Insert A Rothschild Central Bank In Their Country And Control THEM As He Controls You!  You Are Just Plain, Ignorant Murderers, That's ALL You Are.
767 2018-04-25 22:15:36 Some witch human greased up a public street sign just to keep people from parking their bike on it. I didn’t know until after, and she was WATCHING ME THROUGH HER BLINDS while I did it. 100% why? Who is this torture artist? Why would you also rub dirt on the oil??? IS THIS A GAME
768 2018-04-25 22:15:33 #pnpcbc
Renewables industries are mostly manufacturing jobs...which are better GDP drivers than oil.   Yes tax fossil fuels out of existence. We and the world will be better off.
769 2018-04-25 22:15:22 Ooh, who was that? Were you covered in oil during this conversation? What a day this must have been!
770 2018-04-25 22:15:20 I think the logic is, the protein in its natural form is allergenic, but if you untwist it, all ok? Idk, seems like snake oil to me but what do I know.
771 2018-04-25 22:15:20 More emails should begin with "Beloved [name]." It makes purchasing perfume oil on an impulse without first knowing how the hell to use it feel a lot better.
772 2018-04-25 22:15:19 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was coconut oil
773 2018-04-25 22:15:07 This is a remarkable thing for a high-profile politician to have tweeted. Undermining the police while they are pouring oil on stormy waters and dealing with death threats against medical professionals.
774 2018-04-25 22:15:03 I need rose hip oil. And blackhead cleanser. But I’m to broke for the both.
775 2018-04-25 22:14:41 I second Dr. Norman's opinion. NL is a leader in health in Atlantic Canada. In my opinion, some of the oil money should be used to attract medical research to NL and make the province a research capital of Eastern Canada.
776 2018-04-25 22:14:38 CBD oil can help. It’s completely legal, and you don’t need an Rx. It really helps with muscle pain. 
777 2018-04-25 22:14:35 Sure, oil is denominated in US dollars and the global oil market is priced in US dollars, so if dollar goes up, price goes down.
778 2018-04-25 22:14:30 Ahhh I'll be reading all the replies to this! I'm so interested in essential oils, and using oil diffusers as an alternative to candles etc. 
779 2018-04-25 22:14:28 Brilliant analysis. Ate least this Koch snake oil you sell is lucrative.
780 2018-04-25 22:14:23 I like it sauteed with garlic and olive oil. But to each their own I guess.
781 2018-04-25 22:14:21 @jimcramer Thoughts on Gulfport Energy? Several valuation measures look cheap and higher oil prices should help the company. Is this a good buy?
782 2018-04-25 22:14:19 Can we get federal funding if we start an "advocacy group" to work towards a ban on tankers from delivering foreign oil on the east coast?

784 2018-04-25 22:14:12 What in the name of Morrissey's hair oil does 'pre-scripted' mean?

The things that pass for knowledge, I can't understand.
785 2018-04-25 22:13:55 What is your economic plan for replacing the income sources from LNG and Oil in Canada? Do we just all go broke?  Why aren't you first creating a replacement income source before a war on fossil fuels? I never quit a job until I have a replacement income. Thanks #bcpoli
786 2018-04-25 22:13:39 We regulate electric companies and natural gas companies. Time to go back to regulating oil companies. This spiking at the pump must stop.
787 2018-04-25 22:13:33 Can you fry plantain without oil?
Or do eba without garri?

797 2018-04-25 22:12:46 But most producers are hedged for 2018 and will not benefit if crude rises. Not sure if you’re saying people who are short the stocks or the E&Ps who are short oil (via hedges)?

803 2018-04-25 22:12:27 that's the look I give white ppl when they ask me how I get me " how did you get your hair like that " like this is called Naps and water, a  lot of Cantu and oil .you could never achieve this
804 2018-04-25 22:12:17 Big oil cut output and raised prices to compensate last month
805 2018-04-25 22:12:13 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
806 2018-04-25 22:12:01 True. Unfortunately oil companies aren't playing fair with the American people. Not practicing supply & demand. Falsely lowering production.
807 2018-04-25 22:11:42 If rainbow warriors are so smart, can they explain the gulf oil spill? They can't... 'cause the religion of peace is responsible
808 2018-04-25 22:11:37 Shame that JT hurt your feelings, but it's still not his fault.

Maybe try to troll @Kinder_Morgan for an apology for failing oil and gas investors and #Albertans ? Might make you feel better.
809 2018-04-25 22:11:34 You should do it, it's pretty simple and it reminds me of oil painting. I recommend to use SAI paint tool instead of Photoshop (just my opinion)

813 2018-04-25 22:11:02 Drilling in ANWR actually increases our dependence on foreign oil sources. There isn’t enough USA demand for the cost of extraction and transport. It will be exported to closer Asian markets. Thus, if we ever actually have a true crisis, it won’t be there for domestic use.
814 2018-04-25 22:10:56 Roberta spilled seasame seed oil in the kitchen and now the house smells like a restaurant
815 2018-04-25 22:10:54 It would not be difficult to get a confirmed appointee to replace Pruitt if there were not a preference for oil and gas lobbyists.
816 2018-04-25 22:10:31 I really like rose hip oil!! It helps with my redness tbhh
817 2018-04-25 22:10:29 There are no "conservative" reps from or in Alberta, they're payed-off mercenaries working for the far-right oil biz, the Koch brother types, an obsolete industry that can only survive on massive government subsidies (tarsands) rather than open market MERIT.

822 2018-04-25 22:10:07 ¿Potencia? Poténciate esta: Oil production in 1950 was 1.5 million barrels/day. When this regime arrived production was 3.6 million b/d expecting to increase to 5 million b/d! But TODAY, after the dilapidation, production has fallen to 1.5 million b/d.

829 2018-04-25 22:09:09 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
830 2018-04-25 22:08:56 The oil is very effective, mix it with any other cream that's not lightening so that it doesn't overdo.
831 2018-04-25 22:08:53 They meet the US Government’s strictest emissions standards and use renewable diesel from hydrogenated vegetable oil.

838 2018-04-25 22:07:04 it was horrible i couldn’t wear mascara either but castor oil saved my life!
839 2018-04-25 22:06:23 Bet you’re extra jealous that I even trims his toenails, make him snacks, give him daily back massages, and had to oil his balls that one time. 
840 2018-04-25 22:06:06 Years ago a wonderful scifi short story on a bacteria that would eat oil spills. Worked wonders until it got into oil wells, refineries, oil created from plant base etc. Could not be contained and civilization collapsed..no oil, no gas, no plastics, no lubrication
841 2018-04-25 22:06:04 It’s working perfectly with the friends but I don’t plan on staying with them long. Especially when I can do it on my own. A man camp is a place that has trailers to provide oil field workers somewhere to live while they’re out here working.
842 2018-04-25 22:06:04 Draft should be done by the end of the month (at this rate)! Then it's months of rubbing Murphys Oil Soap into it, and spraying it with copious amounts of Lysol. #waxon #waxoff #5amwritersclub #TheGhostsVerandah Thanks for lighting that fire under my ass.
843 2018-04-25 22:06:00 North Dakota is the second largest producer of oil in the nation and a major contributor to U.S. energy security.
844 2018-04-25 22:05:50 I said the same thing!!! Dude is 94 years old. I’m sure lots of male clients moan during a massage. You’re slowly stroking somebody’s body with warm oil. How do you not expect them to moan?
845 2018-04-25 22:05:40 What does it take to be the top oil and natural gas producer in the #USA? 
846 2018-04-25 22:05:40 Next time toss in a small can of sliced black olives, olive oil & crushed garlic (from a jar) to those tomatoes and youll have a nice Putanesca sauce.
847 2018-04-25 22:05:36 Does anyone else drink black coffee with coconut oil.  Asking for a friend.  lol
848 2018-04-25 22:05:29 Obama killed khadafi because he was trading oil with euro.
849 2018-04-25 22:05:21 You do not INCREASE the strength of your rope by keeping it conditioned/hydrated, you MAINTAIN it. Oiling your rope prevents it from drying out. Dry jute is brittle  & easily damaged. Adding oil helps maintain the cellular structure of the jute fibers that your rope is made of
850 2018-04-25 22:05:10 I use all natural oils only as a moisturizer (coconut, avocado, or olive oil), I don't use the rose or whatever oils those are  but also I have a prescription for triamcinilone cream, ask ur doc. for it!! Hope this helps! Also I avoid super hot showers
851 2018-04-25 22:04:56 Champions of the oil fields
852 2018-04-25 22:04:55 But agree that DREAM study results perhaps hampered by varied study population overall (w restasis use part of that) - despite no apparent real differences between groups. Still doesn’t explain olive oil effect though.
853 2018-04-25 22:04:42 We’re spending all this money securing oil and resources in the Middle East thru war yet but can’t put some of that money toward the development of renewable energy? Nah im not buying it.
854 2018-04-25 22:04:29 I guess I’m thinking of cannabis oil eventually being vaped..not vaping of dry cannabis as that wouldn’t have the additives etc
855 2018-04-25 22:04:28 Ha back when there were attendants checking your motor oil cleaning your window airing your tires that was what? Like super service right?
856 2018-04-25 22:04:15 The cream or oil.. which one is better
857 2018-04-25 22:04:08 It will take time to transition off of fossil fuels. Learn about the oil and gas industry to learn how to do it. @BlanchardSL @UNFCCC

860 2018-04-25 22:03:18 With fish it's mostly building a broth. I usually fry the curry paste or spices in coconut oil, add onions, peppers, aromatics, deglaze with stock &/or coconut milk, splash of fish sauce. Then poach fish at the very end just until cooked through, finishing with cilantro.

865 2018-04-25 22:02:41 Look at him. He's a con like trump. Beady-eyed used car salesman. (Apologies to used car salespeople.) Snake oil salesman, yep, that's better. Where's the money coming from again? Why don't you hit up your corporate pals? Lots of money in THOSE coffers now! More than ever! RESIGN
866 2018-04-25 22:02:40 Continue sales in the US. They did develop them and leased some in parts of Cali where they were very popular, however the big money from the oil companies and the bush administration ended the mandate and the development of the vehicles.
867 2018-04-25 22:02:19 @nelsonatra Put a few drops of warm olive oil in your ear and soak a washcloth in warm water,ring it and apply on your ear.Put pillows to keep your head higher,it will do some good Laura.
868 2018-04-25 22:02:18 Lmfaooo this young guy who was putting oil back in our house started to hit on me and my dad was like “Easy now...She’s only 17.” And his friend and I started laughing 
869 2018-04-25 22:02:11 It's my first time rn not doing my own oil change.

872 2018-04-25 22:01:23 To any one currently upset with gas prices, you elected a government that introduced a carbon tax. Big oil will simply just pass that onto the consumer. Likely to effect travel, food and goods. Get out the peddle bikes trans mountain protesters.

882 2018-04-25 22:00:09 The price of coconut and palm oil has skyrocketed. I’m just praying they leave shea butter alone because my hair and skin needs it. I actually can’t handle the avocado pictures, I’ve been eating since I was on solid food.

885 2018-04-25 21:59:29 my brother just asked if he can substitute oil with vinegar to cook I-
886 2018-04-25 21:59:25 actually I feel like fish oil is an anti-depressant for me. everytime I start taking it again I feel fucking great.
887 2018-04-25 21:59:24 so you're not satisfied that tesco is now selling caprisun and ribena with no added sugar which is disgusting btw.  what else do you want to introduce, chocolate with no added sugar?!  crisps with no added salt?chips with no added oil? #BritainsFatFight
888 2018-04-25 21:58:59 I wonder if @Dodge would trade my 06 1500 with a bad oil pump for the demon...
889 2018-04-25 21:58:51 I got more sanding on Misato done.  Now she's soaking in dish soap to remove dirty, sanding residue, Vaseline, and oil.
Next step is priming for issue checking.
890 2018-04-25 21:58:37 When are you going to stop using oil and gas?
891 2018-04-25 21:58:36 has anyone tried oil pulling? if so what are you thoughts on it & results.
892 2018-04-25 21:58:24 Drink lots of water and mind my own business  how I wish. 

Like honestly babes right now I don't have one. I just wash my face with sunlight the yellowish bar but I use the Safeway 4 in 1 face and body brush. I use the Neutrogena toner and apply the celltone tissue oil.
893 2018-04-25 21:58:10 I find moisturising and braiding my hair every night helps to retain more moisture & keeps it detangled too which is a plus! I steal my brothers shea moisture coconut curl defining conditioner & pink oil mainly 
894 2018-04-25 21:57:44 You must be one of the privileged few, that is independently wealthy and can afford such a vehicle irregardless of how much you are taxed.  Congratulations.

BTW, Oil is made in Canada too, at least the oil we don’t import is. Too bad we can’t get it to market even in Canada.
895 2018-04-25 21:57:44 tea tree oil is a product of the racist patriarchy.
896 2018-04-25 21:57:35 never remove your contact lenses when you have tea tree oil leftover on your fingers
897 2018-04-25 21:57:30 Lovely new oil paintings by artist David Farmer!

900 2018-04-25 21:57:18 A Muslim co worker carried around a book on the moorish invasion, he openly told me he was working on conversion of west to islam. Liberals and rhinos take$$ from oil countries as a bribe. Minorities and communist buy into the plan because they want their lot to improve. It wont
901 2018-04-25 21:57:03 @petenajarian @RiskReversal Can we please get past Facebook. And talk about oil for one minute my God earnings were fantastic we know that.
902 2018-04-25 21:56:58 @DarrellWhite that’s basically correct (restasis users = 20% of placebo group in DREAM study), vs 21% of fish oil users. Take home: no real diffs in groups to account for outcomes. Restasis use also analyzed in terms of OSDI scores, w no interaction found (or even any trend)
903 2018-04-25 21:56:55 You missed me! I am most definitely not a plant 
904 2018-04-25 21:56:10 @HyundaiCanada you need to do something about your wait times for service appointments. Over an hour just for an oil change? I even had an appointment lol. That’s ridiculous
905 2018-04-25 21:56:08 can yall stop using coconut oil on ur face ur clogging ur god damn pores
906 2018-04-25 21:56:04 My dream is to surf Rockaway Beach with torn, oil soaked jeans and a Ramones shirt on....

910 2018-04-25 21:55:44 Sorry, G, that ain't gonna sell F-150s in the oil patch. 
Still, I have high hopes for electric cars after about 2022 when the energy density of batteries allows them to get into the range of 400+ miles oo a charge. I hope for an electric future too.
911 2018-04-25 21:55:32 The fact that Denooyer gives me $50 oil changes and tire rotation for life makes me soooooo happy 
912 2018-04-25 21:55:28 Yes, but as a native New Yorker (and "Nutmegger" for the last thirty years) New York IS the best, bar none (Northern NJ is close).  In those 30 years I've found two places in CT that come close.

The key is olive oil on the dough before the sauce or cheese!!!

clary sage is my favorite essential oil
914 2018-04-25 21:55:24 Ooh, good thought. Gravitational potential energy. I didn't think of that. (Someone will now say, bit hour did the water get up there, it's all sun powered, and they'll have a point, but it's less stored sunlight than oil is.)

919 2018-04-25 21:54:22 Of course Massa saw Mercedes as "far ahead" of Ferrari -- because they were. Testing clearly showed this. Enter a Ferrari oil cheat and @pirellisport screwing with same compound tire psi race to race and voila!... @ScuderiaFerrari suddenly looks great while Mercedes struggles.
920 2018-04-25 21:54:02 Crazy weather rolled into San Antonio today (still having it) with wind, rain, and hail. I was at my mechanic's shop getting a new battery and an oil change, fretting as it grew so dark, it looked like night came early. I made it home as the first fat droplets began to fall.
921 2018-04-25 21:53:54 Definitely stay away from @PAXvapor. I decided to buy one (an Era) and try it out. 1 pod stopped working and 1 exploded oil all over the device. Customer service told me they can't do anything. Throwing the device away.
922 2018-04-25 21:53:42 @BOEReport On your website in "About", you never explain what "BOE" stands for in BOEReport - Bank of England, barrel oil equivalent, board of energy, bureau of exchange? You also don't indicate what you are: a government agency, private company, an industry coalition, media co.?
923 2018-04-25 21:53:32 How my sister gonna tell me I oughta be shamed of myself cuz I grabbed the the vegetable oil bag instead of the beer bag tryna hide it

926 2018-04-25 21:52:45 [ Why do my hands smell like baby oil... For real i got off my bus from work and they reek of baby oil. ]
927 2018-04-25 21:52:38 But make sure you check the oil in all of them 
928 2018-04-25 21:52:37 were going to manufacture aversion toward incels so we can invade incel countries and take their oil

935 2018-04-25 21:51:40 what do you want mr I sell oil for a living
936 2018-04-25 21:51:34 Pull back to an 88% retracement 67.36. Small timeframe don't dig it, but it's a perfect DZ   If that holds oil going higher.

939 2018-04-25 21:51:06 Hi! The deforestation issue is definitely a big concern of mine. Because palm oil is so beneficial to the skin, I work privately with a supplier who only provides ethically sourced palm oil, from the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil' s certificatied list. I hope that helps. :)

942 2018-04-25 21:50:52 life has become a constant cycle of needing an oil change
943 2018-04-25 21:50:50 Oil can spout..
944 2018-04-25 21:50:41 FYI, that photo of the reclaimed Suncor 'mine' was actually a topsoil storage site, not a mine. Alberta has not certified any oil sands mine as reclaimed. The problem of how to reclaim tailings ponds has not been solved. You should be honest @jkenney. #abpoli
945 2018-04-25 21:50:33 A drizzle of balsamic vinegar and some good olive oil on top is amazing
946 2018-04-25 21:50:15 Not yet, but will be done on Friday with a full summer tune-up. Oil/radiator/transmission/steering and brake fluid change, serpentine belt replacement, tire change, brake inspection, new wipers and a car wash to finish the day off.
947 2018-04-25 21:50:12 getting my oil changed and someone smells heavily of beef jerky and i am SO here for it
948 2018-04-25 21:49:57 Just purchased art for my new condo .... $2880 for 2 oil paintings 
949 2018-04-25 21:49:47 “Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over...”
950 2018-04-25 21:49:24 Actually, thinking about it, it was really just a particular amount of fish oil, and there's never going to be more of it made, so in that regard it actually is a bit like quaaludes.

We also know that there was at least briefly a craze for them, as well as semi-recreational use.
951 2018-04-25 21:49:16 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
952 2018-04-25 21:48:56 I had mushroom, spinach with truffle oil. Utterly delicious.
953 2018-04-25 21:48:41 When Earth's oil runs out, you'll recoil.
954 2018-04-25 21:48:27 Today I went to the dealership to get my oil change & tire rotated. As soon as they were ready with my car, the agent tells me that I my oil change today & the next 8 were free. Look at my God 
955 2018-04-25 21:48:22 The regular liberals. The neocons just tried to use the situation to opportunistically grab some oil.
956 2018-04-25 21:48:03 i just showered and i need another shower bc @queenkika_ decided to tell me to change her car oil AFTER i showered (-:

Huile de coco est des pouvoir raffermissant...Essayer
958 2018-04-25 21:47:40 You're more than welcome just shout when. Fair warning, it will likely need a scrub. I'd also recommend spray oil for lube btw
959 2018-04-25 21:47:36 Makes me wanna come back to oil city 
960 2018-04-25 21:47:23 Never fails. Spent good part of Saturday taking apart the front of a riding lawn mower, not a scratch. Spent a good chunk of today putting it back together, not a scratch. Something simple like changing the oil? Almost cut the tip of my finger off.
961 2018-04-25 21:47:13 Gothca..so yeah probably new spark plug set, all fluid changes like oil, radiator,  transmission..filters like oil, air, fuel.....something along those lines. At least you won't need to do it again for awhile. But ah to have a car with only 60000 lol
962 2018-04-25 21:47:10 somebody spilled oil (??) all over the downtown 1 entrance staircase at 110th and I slid around in it like a demonic ice skater
963 2018-04-25 21:46:45 Assholes like Suzuki lectures on negativities of our #OilPatch & who is to blame! He has never submited a plan on how to better produce oil!
964 2018-04-25 21:46:27 I didn’t vote for Notley but if she cuts back oil production by %50 bans wine and other exports from British Columbia coming into Albert I might consider voting for her next time around (not ! kick me in the nuts)
965 2018-04-25 21:46:22 One answer...OIL
966 2018-04-25 21:46:18 "You got the stuff?"
"I got everything you need, I got fish oil, I got chitauri biogel, I got vibranium flakes, I got reds and whites, but my blues connection got blown up by Black Widow."
"Dammit, what I need is that ground dragon-bone."
"You and about a hundred ninjas, honey."
967 2018-04-25 21:45:59 To an oil field?
968 2018-04-25 21:45:57 What would y’all pay for a 1988 Harris? Looks to be in decent shape. Medium oil color. Not sure I can dye it because my horsemanship outfit is chocolate, but my pleasure/trail outfit is black.
969 2018-04-25 21:45:53 Yeah I had to use a spray with apple cider vinegar, water, tea tree and peppermint. Then I would also rub my scalp with vitamin e oil
970 2018-04-25 21:45:40 Is oil not booming now? Just name one project this government started and completed. #lazygovernment
971 2018-04-25 21:45:31 Delicious oil
972 2018-04-25 21:45:10 I think the  was proven to be hurting Nigeria & Angola's light oil, not Saudi Arabia;  the Saudis have willfully and strategically made a choice to target US inventories which will benefit them in the long run.  Since they own a refinery in Texas, they can always buy oil.

974 2018-04-25 21:45:05 but at the risk of having to apologize in front of thousands of fans?? I think they'd temper the complaining down (obviously not a real suggestion). I do think that "riding the refs" is a strategic move for any player/coach. The squeaky wheel gets the oil unfortunately.

976 2018-04-25 21:44:42 OH. Is natural resource extraction the secret sauce? So all the investments from China in Africa with agreements for exchange in cheap imports makes all of those states proxy states to China? Or agreements from oil pipelines to Russia make Syria a proxy state?
977 2018-04-25 21:44:42 @realDonaldTrump since canada is our number one supplier , why are they not helping keep the price of oil down, they make many billions off of us when these prices on a barrel are raised.

983 2018-04-25 21:44:07 About 10 years ago I started at a company that produced software for the oil industry. It was a small-ish office, less than 30 people in UK and pretty friendly. One of the best bosses I’ve ever worked for too. She bought us Fish & Chips occasionally and doughnuts regularly.

986 2018-04-25 21:43:48 @RiskReversal @petenajarian Just think about it earnings are spectacular why would the market not go up 100 points in the S&P? It’s getting quite ridiculous the pessimism nothing good has been priced in!!! Again please go over oil earnings on Friday.  I’m shocked I haven’t heard?
987 2018-04-25 21:43:48 Lmk if u wanna come pick up my car from work and get an oil change for me , I’ll give you a kiss

989 2018-04-25 21:43:41 3/ Many journalists of the financial press are no different than most "mainstream" media. All they do is repeat narratives given to them by "big names" Remember when the US media didn't question the US govt in 2003 about their Iraq claims? #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #CL_F

993 2018-04-25 21:43:28 2/ John Kemp @JKempEnergy like throwing words around like "professional". Well he is a professional........a professional narrative pusher (whether he realizes it or not.....I'm leaning towards the latter). He couldn't answer back. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #CL_F
994 2018-04-25 21:43:25 I'm pretty sure my guts are full of feathers and live wasps, coated with engine oil.
995 2018-04-25 21:43:18 1/ When John Kemp (@JKempEnergy) was questioned on why he doesn't do actual investigation every time a shady Libyan oil company claims a "pipeline attack" or what not (he just repeats ANYTHING the company says), he blocked me. Quite telling #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #CL_F
996 2018-04-25 21:43:15 @LouDobbs why does no one talk about Canada being the #1 oil distributor to America, who makes billions off of the working man , and never lifts a finger to help with oil prices
997 2018-04-25 21:43:14 The first things I’m doing once i make it to washington on my road trip is buy smoke & get an oil change lol my poor baby gone need some tlc like me
998 2018-04-25 21:42:56 I know new spark plugs plus fuel injector cleaning was 250 for me. add say oil change, radiator flush thats another 100 or so..eck..dunno what's all included just guessing. Dunno if it's better to do it all at once or what. Those shouldn't be yearly though besides the oil change?
999 2018-04-25 21:42:56 Since when was coconut oil/ cream part of the Mediterranean diet? Am I missing something..
1000 2018-04-25 21:42:27 Please stop shilling for the oil and gas industry! It's becoming embarrassing!
1001 2018-04-25 21:42:26 For all you people and companies that send them money cut off the donations then Suzuki can step up to the plate and top off the donations lost do to his belief of shutting down the oil industry which we depend on
1002 2018-04-25 21:42:13 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1003 2018-04-25 21:42:12 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1007 2018-04-25 21:41:30 Do it! That face cream I bought is amazing, I’m sure the oil will be too.

1011 2018-04-25 21:40:40 Under the current administration, unprecedented change has come to Nig. There's ease of doing business, agriculture is now back as the mainstay of Nigeria's economy, after oil. The Anchor Borrowers Programme is yielding tremendous success. Sustain the development with your PVC.
1012 2018-04-25 21:40:38 Suzuki is triggering oil sands people again. Good!
1013 2018-04-25 21:40:37 It’s not “ all” gas and oil.. more@and more renewables are coming online despite the push back and hard lobby of oil and gas. We don’t need CPV or Cricket valley to go online to keep the lights on.

1020 2018-04-25 21:40:03 Have you seen @theturner's book "The Patch"? It's a sympathetic portrait of the Canadian oil sands. He explains exactly how they came to be a target of the environmental movement. If you reject carbon pricing, what's your plan to get the target off their back?
1021 2018-04-25 21:40:02 SCOTLAND HAS BENT CIVIL SERVANTS SUPPORTING SNP GOVT, BUT THEIR INDYREF FORECAST WAS BASED ON OIL AT $115 PER BARREL - NOT MENTIONED ANYMORE !

1026 2018-04-25 21:39:11 @sunriseon7 @kochie_online Could you also caution people that a falling $AUD (well, rising $USD) magnifies fuel costs, so expect #fuel to rise, because we STILL have this strange 'parity' system going, and NO local crude oil refining, or strategic reserves! #Australia #oilandgas
1027 2018-04-25 21:39:04 @JEChalmers Does Labor have any plans to help ease the pressure of near record high petrol prices?
Global oil prices are still well below all time highs, yet we're paying premium prices for some reason.
Petrol bill increased $140 last quarter.

1030 2018-04-25 21:38:36 On the bright side, at least you weren't using oil paint as it would've been turps :)

1034 2018-04-25 21:37:31 @petenajarian @RiskReversal @GuyAdami Why are we not talking about oil at all when we have two huge Earnings on Friday. Chevron and Exxon. Two companies that are super bullish in my opinion. I haven’t heard anything about the oil stocks all week
1035 2018-04-25 21:37:22 Is there a Dragon Soul essential oil?
1036 2018-04-25 21:37:21 Nothing stopping the police from investigating oil scandal and BWSC. PL government has all the files. Most decent people want justice irrespective of party. I didn’t see PM Gonzi defend oil scandal or take legal action to stop judicial process.

1040 2018-04-25 21:37:16 Those numbers sound great until you look at how much a percentage of GDP your exports are....You're a rentier state, oil is both your lifeblood and your jugular. For all the mess that @PutinRF_Eng has managed to stir up here, you are nothing more than a midsized economy.

1043 2018-04-25 21:36:54 Did Gendo bang all of the scientists at nerv or just Yui, Ritsuko and Ritsuko's mom? Is this why he reminds me of my dad?
1044 2018-04-25 21:36:53 My fave is prosciutto, Brie, and arugula with chilli oil on top. You can easily do a substitute of mushrooms with the prosciutto.
1045 2018-04-25 21:36:53 Do you put hoof oil on?
1046 2018-04-25 21:36:50 Can you fry plantain without Oil?
Or make Eba without garri?
1047 2018-04-25 21:36:46 #pnpcbc How on earth have the Liberals put Albertans out of work???? It was the price of oil that caused that problem.
1048 2018-04-25 21:36:33 If they do it in the Arabian Gulf - that’s would boost the oil prices to 140$...!!! 

Maybe that’s the target .....

1051 2018-04-25 21:36:17 If the dollar keeps going up, I expect oil to adjust.
1052 2018-04-25 21:36:06 Then you are dooming your kids to a bleak future. Have fun with that. If you actually believe that oil is going to last forever, you probably don’t have the intelligence necessary to see how poorly you are planning for their future.
1053 2018-04-25 21:35:55 It’s not oil

1066 2018-04-25 21:34:49 Environmental questions? Like GMOs, nuclear waste, oil pipelines, and GHGs?
1067 2018-04-25 21:34:48 How do you expect that #IndianPoint will be replaced without relying on fossil fuel fired generation?  NYISO says there is enough excess generating capacity to close the plant, but that is *all* gas and oil fired generation.
1068 2018-04-25 21:34:37 Since Patriot doesn't work in ABM mode despite its predecessor HAWK being effective in said role, it is kind of hard to protect Gulf Oil Installations from massed Iranian Missile fire. Especially as the Gulf States are hopeless militarily.
1069 2018-04-25 21:34:34 Who was it that was putting pressure on the US with high oil prices just prior to the bailouts?
1070 2018-04-25 21:34:04 @RonJichardson cracking nite in Newcastle, not laughed so much for ages. Thanks so much, 1st date night after the baby. Never had the oil massage though. 
1071 2018-04-25 21:33:36 You should study the Scandinavian countries. Take Norway where you are entitled money if you're unemployed, have a right to a home even if you have no income, right to healthcare no matter what your status (even dead). All have been basic right since the 50's. Oil baby.

1076 2018-04-25 21:33:01 So I found the cure for a cold. Counter attack, immunity shots, Umka tea, green juice, Tylenol, oregano oil, emergenc, Alca seltzer plus, promethazine, water, and 3 days without getting out of bed. Works most of the time, 100 percent of the time.
1077 2018-04-25 21:33:00 Kanye just texted me to remember to change my oil regularly or it could ruin the engine.
1078 2018-04-25 21:32:50 My hair is short so it gets oily really fast, and the problem is I keep touching it all day every day.  Even if I wash my hands the oil comes on fast!!
1079 2018-04-25 21:32:44 The whole reason bears ears was made so large was to stop oil from being drilled there. Also, before it's reduction ~70% of Utah was owned federally. The Federal government owns ~52% of the western US. Oil is a dumb reason either way, but laissez-faire. Let the state decide.
1080 2018-04-25 21:32:41 Listening to Coody talk about how wind industry jobs are temporary.... googles how many people Devon and Chesapeake have laid off...... and then how the wind industry won’t leave because “the wind is here”.... googles if the oil will leave Oklahoma....
1081 2018-04-25 21:32:40 Not a great example to start with as the Oil Rumble is like right around the corner.
1082 2018-04-25 21:32:22 When oil was150 dollars a barrel before the 2008 financial crisis in US. FEDS position was higher oil prices thus higher prices of goods
1083 2018-04-25 21:32:05 Well, the source numbers suggest it’s less than an order of magnitude. 

And that’s just this year, not including future growth of EV buses.

As you know, the ~2015 crash was cataclysmic for many companies. So, could a >0.2% drop in demand “hurt” oil companies? Seems plausible.
1084 2018-04-25 21:31:56 Can dragon energy replace oil as the number one resource of the Middle East?
1085 2018-04-25 21:31:44 Sorry Tom, racists don’t drill for oil.
1086 2018-04-25 21:31:19 Use it to make meringue too 
1087 2018-04-25 21:31:19 We are nowhere near ready to retire internal combustion automobiles, Boats, Planes.   We don't have enough viable plastic alternatives, and Oil unfortunately still heats many homes in Northern parts of Canada.

1089 2018-04-25 21:31:16 Still preferable than anyone and to be fair the only thing that stopping oil from jumping to 375$/ a.k.a 6 Times than the current price is the US carrier battlegroup controlling Persian gulf; US becoming cannon fodder for Europe against Russia.
1090 2018-04-25 21:31:13 Malaysia's PM Najib Razak: Malaysia to cut corporate, income taxes in next 5 years. Malaysia corporate tax cuts to depend on oil price, GST revenue

1092 2018-04-25 21:30:37 NNPC is the only establishment that bribes the whole Nigeria.

1098 2018-04-25 21:30:13 I'd watch a prequel series about Misato and Ritsuko joining NERV prior to the Angels returning. I feel like there's a lot of room there. What was NERV up to pre angel invasion? What is their training program like?
1099 2018-04-25 21:30:12 I used to like Halibut Orange when I was a kid but the last time I tried a lemon flavoured fish oil I couldn’t stand it 
1100 2018-04-25 21:29:53 just checked the oil in my car w/o using google or my parents. i’m officially masc.
1101 2018-04-25 21:29:52 My mom gotta pick somewhere else to get her oil changes. I’m not about to keep driving out to streetsboro

1103 2018-04-25 21:29:37 left my car at home today so my dad could change my oil & i come home and he says my car isnt working gr8 love it

1105 2018-04-25 21:29:26 Lower oil prices should translate into lower goods & services prices. But no the sheep consumers were made to pay higher inflated prices .

1108 2018-04-25 21:29:02 Decided to try magnesium oil spray on achy legs after hearing such good things. Can't speak to the benefits for recovery yet, but the "tingling on first application" is definitely real 
1109 2018-04-25 21:29:01 They recommend you have an oil change every 3000 miles. 
Assume that’s what’s happening here.
1110 2018-04-25 21:28:59 You pipe it to Texas. You pay for refining and send it back up on a truck. It's a miracle we're not paying Europrices. How is buying Kinder Morgan a pipeline or investing in the Oil Sands Project not like government interfering with private enterprise?
1111 2018-04-25 21:28:57 He criticizes oil industry for not being environmentally sensitive; orphan wells do not respect the  environment either.
1112 2018-04-25 21:28:50 If you know anyone with a stutter mention that CBD oil might help, I've stopped stuttering (99% stopped) and want ppl to know
1113 2018-04-25 21:28:43 #1 is good alignment of spine and pelvis:  You don’t want your knees trying to compensate for problems elsewhere. 

#2 is Nutrition:  OptiMSM is AMAZING, Bone broth, whole foods, fish oil, enzymatic anti-inflammatories, and avoidance of inflammatory triggers  like grains.
1114 2018-04-25 21:28:32 Gendo reminds me of my dad. Take that as you will...
1115 2018-04-25 21:28:13 14% seems like a lot to me. Eg: Gazprom is ~12% of world ex China gas production; Saudi Aramco is ~15% of world ex-China oil production.
1116 2018-04-25 21:27:57 As long as the @bcndp @jjhorgan @carolejames keeps working on lowering #VanRE prices to reflect the local taxpaying economy, doesn't get sucked into bowing down to progressive minorities & focuses on BC's economy (ie Canada needs to sell oil) they will get my vote next election

1119 2018-04-25 21:27:35 150 years ago JD Rockefeller told Cornelius Vanderbilt that Standard Oil would no longer be utilizing its tanker cars. Due to it being inefficient and dangerous. So JD built pipelines across the continental US. Why has this come full circle?
1120 2018-04-25 21:27:29 This my Oil and Gas class group are just mad.
1121 2018-04-25 21:27:10 I think that’s what they were going for. Suppose to be an medical innovation hub for UT/aTm/Baylor medical colleges, so it’s fitting.
This & the Saudi oil company making Houston its Western Hemisphere headquarters are the two biggest economic factors coming into the city.
1122 2018-04-25 21:27:07 You can buy CBD oil now from Holland & Barrett but the most potent part of the plant is the THC and that remains illegal. So you’d have to make the oil yourself. Let me find out for you if CBD oil can help with alcoholism. Give me a day or so.
1123 2018-04-25 21:27:00 So about this Lexus I want... my customer told me she drove a Benz... past tense. Drove. Traded that bitch in after she had to pay $2400 for an oil change and new spark plugs! My heart literally stopped beating. I felt that!
1124 2018-04-25 21:26:59 Trump is a 3rd class conman. Everything he does and says is all about selling the snake oil. He has no interest or love for America and his main goal throughout his despicable life is to hurt others while looking after himself. What’s amazing is how many have been fooled 
1125 2018-04-25 21:26:54 Moisturize daily with water, conditioner and hair oil combo. Wash regularly. Never use a comb. Use your fingers to separate the strands. It will grow
1126 2018-04-25 21:26:49 Someone tell "Uche from taxify" that if he sends me another email I'll look for him in the spiritual realm and pour hot oil on him. Idiot
1127 2018-04-25 21:26:44 My brother at xmas: you need to put oil in your car
me, end of April: I just put oil in my car
Brother: the poor little thing 


1128 2018-04-25 21:26:39 In general Foreign aid to countries that are worse off than us will only support ourselves in the long run.. in the case of failing countries, they will eventually topple and we will have more oil, for authoritarian regimes we will have cheaper oil
1129 2018-04-25 21:26:36 How did I miss all this highly thought out discussion, albeit academic about DRC mining fiscal legislation. My only take as DRC native is, that the best anything solution in DRC is the simplest. Simple in implementation & administration, thus less corruption. Kudos to you all

1135 2018-04-25 21:25:55 For more than two years oil prices were kept down, what is the excuse for the corrupt Federal Reserve to allow inflation to get out of hand
1136 2018-04-25 21:25:54 No wonder @ToyotaCanada is crushing @nissancanada. $2200 timing chain guide repair that they are losing class action suits for but refuse to pay. now axle seals that leak oil onto the brakes (can you say #deathtrap )that they want well over $1000 to fix.
1137 2018-04-25 21:25:51 Do you need any oil? I'm more than happy applying it for you?

1139 2018-04-25 21:25:39 I liked Asuka a lot more as a teen for the sake of her fantastic action scenes but she's far more upsetting a character having known/loved people like her. You just hurt for her with everything she's had to go through.
1140 2018-04-25 21:25:32 When they allowed imported foreign oil to not meet same emission standards  as Canadian oil, the Libs proved that they really didn't give a shit about Canadians.
1141 2018-04-25 21:25:29 @TeamCavuto If Pres Macron want to let ‘Science’ cure the global warming problem, he should have all of the world unemployed ride bicycles that power generators, until solar powered cells are more cost efficient than clean coal and oil. People are still burning wood for heat.
1142 2018-04-25 21:25:27 Huckabee needs to educate himself and understand the case. The parents are being horribly exploited by snake oil salesmen.
1143 2018-04-25 21:25:17 tis all part of the policy mix that leads to 50% of GDP in nat'l savings and current acocunt surpluses of 20% (w-o oil),

& the decision to take delivery of the fx on forwards and hand the proceeds over to the GIC (done in 14-15 I think) certianly feels like direct fx management
1144 2018-04-25 21:24:42 Yeppers it all the 45ths fault.  Try the nation doesn't have the capacity to refine the glut of oil there is because there hasn't been a new oil refinery built in over 41 years.

1149 2018-04-25 21:24:23 Per your recommendation, I ended up trying the Almond Oil Wood Snoked Sea Salt chips. I did not enjoy them. The flavor wasn’t for me, and I miss the taste/texture/consistency of the baked chips.
1150 2018-04-25 21:23:20 I love it. I’m actually trying to source the seeds from home in Guyana to make the oil. Mexicans use Marmee oil to strengthen n grow eyelashes. It’s now being put in mascara.
1151 2018-04-25 21:23:19 People do not want to HAVE to boost a kid's immune system. It sucks. It involves sticking a needle into your kid's belly, it burns and they cry, it's $$$, it's stressful.  If there was some oil or "super food" that would replace his missing IgG cells, we'd do that! There isnt.

1153 2018-04-25 21:22:53 Kaji is my favorite character. I know he couldn't really exist in a post-weinstein era because his early characterization is more or less built around him sexually harassing folks but he is to be the only one in the entire show (minus penpen) that's in control of his own destiny.

1156 2018-04-25 21:22:28 Ha, The squeaky wheel gets the oil 
1157 2018-04-25 21:22:28 Let’s hope it doesn’t get hacked and pointed in the wrong direction then! Even manned warships crash into oil tankers!!

1160 2018-04-25 21:21:41 I know your whole playbook is comprised mostly of agitation and provocation over anything you can find, but frankly the most offensive part of your tweet is the suggestion that any of your books are worth the paper or storage media that they exist on. Have fun with the snake oil.
1161 2018-04-25 21:21:26 I didn't think anyone could turn this oil tanker around. He's almost single handedly improved every facet of the club, brought the club, team and fans back together, all with great humility.

1165 2018-04-25 21:20:27 Although #geopolitical #risks and bullish #oil demand growth projections currently outweigh bearish factors, if money managers start to exit the extremely overstretched longs, the rally could come to an abrupt end. @TREnergy #PowerEnergy18
1166 2018-04-25 21:20:24 Looks like the top 3 birds were domestic chickens, so possibly not related to the oil spill?
1167 2018-04-25 21:20:20 @toddtalk Hey Todd this guy sounds like the same old left babble of everybody paying their fair share! I do not want to pay for some else foundation problem. I had to pay to replace my oil tank this year, no body helped me!!!!!

1172 2018-04-25 21:19:56 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the oil and gas industry.

1175 2018-04-25 21:19:52 With a glut of oil at that.  Another industry infrastructure neglected in the nation Oil Refinery.  Course you cant blame the oil industry, nobody wants a refinery in their back yard (as the saying goes).  The oil companies just cant keep up with demand.  Inflate price to curb it
1176 2018-04-25 21:19:45 I thought i liked lavender oil. But i dont. it relaxes me to a point where my body and mind feels so weird and groggy the next day. I sprayed it on my pillow during my masters thesis times and it knocked me tf out. I slept for 12 hours everyday even my dreams were crazy
1177 2018-04-25 21:19:40 If you could only afford one or the other which would you pay for gas or oil change?

1181 2018-04-25 21:19:13 I had to get my oil changed today so I figured I would bring some homework and finish up my last paper while I was waiting. Guess who forgot literally the only book she needed to actually work on it 
1182 2018-04-25 21:19:03 People frequently cite Shinji's discontentment with piloting an Eva as a reason for disliking him. Because as we all know most child soldiers are thrilled with their lot in life.

1184 2018-04-25 21:18:59 During the Obam administration, this country was one of the largest oil producing in the world. We still are not thanks to Trump.
1185 2018-04-25 21:18:56 You only need to worry about oil pressure.
1186 2018-04-25 21:18:54 Haha.  Yes I get mad too every time Gas prices drop.  Dam you oil driller dudes.   Haha.
1187 2018-04-25 21:18:41 you realize oil prices have been rising and are hovering around $70?
1188 2018-04-25 21:18:31 I'm working in an oil company... Have to use 110v. Moved the kitchen last week, their dishwasher was 415v
1189 2018-04-25 21:17:26 It is sustainable as it’s a renewable energy. Oil isn’t going to be around forever. You get it’s a finite resource, right? Solar, wind and hydroelectric are infinite.

It wasn’t failing until someone pulled the funding for it.
1190 2018-04-25 21:17:23 Need Some Oil Fa Sunday I Wanna Go To Church
1191 2018-04-25 21:17:17 Now that we are beginning to beat the taliban out of aafghanistan we should not be there as much. We should be giving aid to Iran as well, they can give us a steady supply of cheaper oil, this will allow our people to live happier lives.
1192 2018-04-25 21:16:52 Still don't love the metaphor where everyone turns to tang. I think Anno was just upset with his fans at that point. And what PenPen's role is in the story. I have a lot of things to say about Evangelion that I am probably going to be putting here...
1193 2018-04-25 21:16:52 So it looks like our “snake oil salesman” of a POTUS doesn’t even possess the most basic of managerial capabilities; certainly no “leader” instincts. We are in deep trouble.

1199 2018-04-25 21:15:47 Boy am I glad I came in for an oil change. My air filters were so nasty!
1200 2018-04-25 21:15:33 Funny how the greatest journalist ever, never investigated BWSC and played down the oil scandal openly saying that she liked AG. Funny how all you purer than white never camped in front of Castille than. Would love to know who is the gate keeper with these files.
1201 2018-04-25 21:15:22 The Saudi's have expressed they would like to see 100$ a barrel oil...to what lengths they might go to achieve that is anybody's guess but the last Saudi to say that was Bin Laden.....

1204 2018-04-25 21:15:10 One of the worst instances of Christians MURDERED in Genocide by Islamic Jihad declared by TURKEY! SHAME on America for not declaring the Genocide because of OIL. SHAME! Remember that ISLAM is an EVIL, Satainc HATE Group that lies, rapes, and MURDERS CHRISTIANS!
1205 2018-04-25 21:15:08 When my friends are talking about dating car girls I'm just like watch out.. One night you're going to piss her off and wake up with your oil drained and a bad gap ratio on your spark plugs 
1206 2018-04-25 21:15:06 But there were points that went way over my head as a 12 year old and then again as a 23 year old. We are all in pain. We have all been hurt by other people. We still need each other. You fill in your wounds by opening your heart, not closing it.
1207 2018-04-25 21:14:21 Cut cucumbers  in Apple cider vinegar and oil with a little salt and sugar depending on your taste. Leave it about 48 hrs in the fridge and it tastes like salt and vinegar chips 
1208 2018-04-25 21:13:26 Kanye, check out my page to my water company. Would love to speak to you about the 23 artesian alkaline water I purchased. Would love to talk to you and your wife about future investments in the water industry, it’s more valuable than oil!

1216 2018-04-25 21:11:45 As a child, one of the many times I visited the National Railway Museum, the guy maintaining Mallard let me put some oil in!
It was already my favourite locomotive at the time, so that was quite special.

1219 2018-04-25 21:10:46 I'm a skeptic tho. Where r the receipts? Name of the oil? Where was it sold?
1220 2018-04-25 21:10:43 How about we do this when BP and Exon are drilling/exploring for oil, when they are blazing the oceans with incredibly loud bangs so that we can experience what whales and other mammals hear

1235 2018-04-25 21:07:29 I feel we should not give aid to OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) because it requires a larger sacrifice of the donor company then the member country of OPEC. The human population is growing, and the demand for oil is higher than ever. #aidtothefailing

1237 2018-04-25 21:07:27 Keto is great. Try making these fat bombs for sweet cravings. Equal parts coconut oil and peanut butter. After warmed up on the stove and liquid, mix in Cocoa powder and Stevia or erythritol for sweetners. Poor into flexible ice trays that have crushed up mac. nuts and almonds.
1238 2018-04-25 21:07:21 Earlier today it became apparent that a gay man in the inner West End of the city of Glasgow had run out of extra-virgin olive oil.
Please be assured that this matter has now been resolved and an investigation will be launched. Members of the public are asked to remain vigilant.

1243 2018-04-25 21:06:53 We should be giving aid to countries that are included in OPEC these authoritarian governments have been lowering the price of oil for us. Their influence on the prices is shown in the article "How much influence does OPEC have on the Price of oil"
1244 2018-04-25 21:06:37 The joke is we have the technology to actually do something about it, but instead we vow to the oil and gas companies. 

Personally, I have no reason to care about protecting the planet. I don’t have kids. The only reason I try is because I like the planet. But I hate the people.
1245 2018-04-25 21:06:31 I got here just in time to get my oil change

Only the wise virgins went in because they trimmed their lamps and they had enough oil and the door was shut.

Make sure between now and that day that you are fully ready and prepared.
1250 2018-04-25 21:05:30 New wipers & air filters in. Now all I need to do is an oil change on my car.

1258 2018-04-25 21:04:32 Coconut oil everywhere and I am LIVING.
1259 2018-04-25 21:04:21 Does anyone use coconut oil for their hair regularly? I want to give it a try but don’t know which brands are worth buying and which ones aren’t
1260 2018-04-25 21:04:02 Not sure if you're into essential oils or that whole scene... But I bought an inexpensive small bottle of rose essential oil and put a few drops on the bottom of the shower floor before I get in. It's like a mini spa. But free.
1261 2018-04-25 21:04:02 In my lifetime I’d like to see 45 and his whole family/crew indicted. I’d also like to see big Pharma, big Oil and most Banksters fail.

1265 2018-04-25 21:03:29 Bottles of sesame oil are really cheap and a dash late in cooking will add wonderful flavor to your stir-fried vegetables. I've always got a bottle beside my stove!
1266 2018-04-25 21:03:12 BoC's Poloz: Lower oil prices will limit growth in energy sector
1267 2018-04-25 21:03:10 Is Dragon Energy the name of the oil company you're going to start on all the public lands you and Trump removed from protected status?  You know--places like Bears Ears.
1268 2018-04-25 21:03:08 apparently i need sunday riley’s ufo oil in my life????
1269 2018-04-25 21:03:07 Texas will collapse when the oil is gone. Rich people leaving blue states just shows rich people are assholes who hate knowing they don't deserve all they have.
1270 2018-04-25 21:03:01 Crude oil prices were trading $73.73 the other day and I lost my shit, legit all I’ve seen for the last two weeks.

1284 2018-04-25 21:01:53 It wasn't for oil. It was for Israel. They also gave us the phony intel about WMDs.
What would you have us do then? Invite all of those people into our countries? To blow us up and suck on the welfare teat? More money spent on those people means less aid available to your son...
1285 2018-04-25 21:01:42 What’s the significance of a tin of olive oil? Have I missed the point?
1286 2018-04-25 21:01:37 Ellen G/oil is a finite dangerous pollute of industry why are we not forward thinking enough to utilize these corporations to train Alaskans not transplants From their corporations to work here?

1291 2018-04-25 21:01:09 At its peak the oil sands made up about 2% of the GDP. Projections for federal revenue(and those are just projections) are about 20 billion over the lifetime of the project. That equates to about $500 per capita in value. Kinder Morgan is huge risk and limited reward.
1292 2018-04-25 21:01:02 The part you can moistureise was put baby oil on then your regular lotion.
1293 2018-04-25 21:00:53 just to moisturize. if your skin clogs easily, you can use jojoba oil instead.
1294 2018-04-25 21:00:50 So let’s buy our gas and oil somewhere else, ok. Can’t help our own country

1311 2018-04-25 20:59:57 I have developed a proposal for a just transition in oil and gas that could ensure full employment, cleanup the mess industry intends to abandon, and capture more resource rent to fund the transition. Happy to email it if you're interested.
1312 2018-04-25 20:59:54 Lies.  Rising oil prices may be good for Alberta and the Feds, but not the rest of the country.

1314 2018-04-25 20:59:30 Lots said about fish oil since a recent review found little effect in preventing major cardiac events. However, it important to note that fish oils does help with other things too: depression, inflammation, lupus, cognitive decline, etc. Eating fish is best, if not try fish oil.
1315 2018-04-25 20:59:28 I put just a tad too much chili oil on my poke and I’m damn near sweating while trying to finish it
1316 2018-04-25 20:59:24 The only thing that I found works is a St.John's Wort oil & canna balm I make & use for mild arthritic joint pain. But in regard to my C-spine injury, the bone pain from ME/cfs/ or my post surgical neuropathy, nope. That's why I need next level pain relief. But alas, I'm denied.
1317 2018-04-25 20:59:19 Still trying to track down rumors that Ronny Jackson caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
1318 2018-04-25 20:59:18 Hey Rep. Earl Sears. Oil isn’t going anywhere, either.
1319 2018-04-25 20:59:06 That meme about calling your dad about extra stuff when you get an oil change is seriously me, except I call the hubs 
1320 2018-04-25 20:58:36 Makes total sense when you have rooftop solar. Zero marginal cost. No mixing 2 stroke oil with petrol/gas. No trips to fill up.  Less flammable liquids around the house. Plugin and play. No breathing in stinky fumes.  Even if no solar panels still cheaper and better.
1321 2018-04-25 20:58:35 I spent the better part of three hours mincing about three pounds of various chiles, and just got out of the shower. I'm pleased to announce that my fingers are completely free of chile oil and aching to touch you.
1322 2018-04-25 20:58:32 Probably paid by big oil.
1323 2018-04-25 20:58:31 The reviews were valid & honestly everything I’ve tried w cannabis oil in it absorbs on the skin so well
1324 2018-04-25 20:58:25 He's talking to Lazy youth who cannot use their head but only eyes and mouth.

I've asked Sowore to tell me how he will run the Economy when oil price comes to $30pb all he keeps saying is. I will cut cost.

A lot of them does not know that, the president does not control NASS
1325 2018-04-25 20:58:20 I heard Senator Tester dresses in a clown outfit for sex, with a dominatrix dressed as Orrin Hatch. Still trying to verify, but that's what I was told.

1339 2018-04-25 20:56:33 Macron wants cheap oil from Iran for France. He's playing Trump like a fiddle. All you have to do is butter him up. Kim Jung gets it. Trump called him a great leader 
1340 2018-04-25 20:56:30 That’s the oil spill! Let me know how you like it! I thought it was very good!
1341 2018-04-25 20:56:27 Olive oil is love, olive oil is life
1342 2018-04-25 20:56:23 Funny how when I would ask my families help with my oil changes they wouldn’t. Now when I do it myself, they take it over 
1343 2018-04-25 20:56:19 Uh oh here comes the stories...BTW they recently tried to stop using the dollar for trading oil...So expect the push to invade and attack soon. Is any1 tired of this movie yet?

1353 2018-04-25 20:55:27 Bill Nye has no idea what he is talking about.  I work in oil and gas exploration.  When we are done drilling and completing wells we are "REQUIRE" by REGULATION (heaviest regulated in the world by the way) to put the land BACK. The forest DOES IN DEED grow back.
1354 2018-04-25 20:55:24 I fry it in a tablespoon or so of olive oil on medium high heat until the edges are nice and crispy 
1355 2018-04-25 20:55:16 Bought mint and tea leaf scented beard oil and it’s been pretty difficult to not tell everyone I see
1356 2018-04-25 20:55:16 Good that will put the oil under those lands, and therefore public oil into the marketplace where it will do more good than laying underground. Save us from another supersonic Fan blade cutting thru avian lifeforms.

1358 2018-04-25 20:55:14 Crude is going up. Watch out for a White House run announcement. Remember that Gore is a bigger oil man than Bush. The scale of the money is unbelievable to most. 50 cents per gallon for a few weeks can finance a small country or a run at the presidency.

1369 2018-04-25 20:53:23 Hard to do when #Alberta, @CPC_HQ, and the ##UCP are trying to force pipelines on BC and Canada.

1390 2018-04-25 20:49:31 My favorites: 
- Life expectancy no more than 49
- We ran out of oil eighteen years ago
- The ice age has destroyed civilization 
- We starved to death over twenty years ago. 

That’s “emotional science”, nothing but hysterical idiocy.
1391 2018-04-25 20:49:14 Last time we paid 1.40 per liter, oil was at $140 per barrel. It is barely half that today. Somebody is getting rich at tax payer expense
1392 2018-04-25 20:49:10 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
1393 2018-04-25 20:49:05 #thinkblueradio says to wash your car in your lawn so oil doesn't go into the sewers. What I hear is "if you own a home, kill your lawn, don't get our sewers dirty." How about maintaining your car? My 95 cherokee doesn't leak a drop
1394 2018-04-25 20:49:04 Pruitt still runs the EPA because Big Oil needs him there, and they can’t be sure his replacement will do everything they need.
1395 2018-04-25 20:48:57 Try tea tree water babe the one from lush is amazing and use oil free facial washes and salycilic acid is good just make sure it doesn’t dry ur face out too much

1401 2018-04-25 20:48:08 Hoping to hear the vote on a specific bill in the OK Legislature. Instead, We have spent the last 2 hours listening to them bicker about a tax credit for the Wind Industry. Just get rid of it and all other special favors to all industries including oil/gas.
1402 2018-04-25 20:48:04 Bio oil all over my body

1408 2018-04-25 20:46:34 oh you know just the best NPC you ever made GARETH decided to phoenix jump on top of one of my characters who had oil around him which set me on fire then proceeded to wake up the enemy i just put to sleep leading to a party wipe.

1413 2018-04-25 20:45:44 I would assume the cannabis oil would be mixed with flavour just like nicotine is.  Smokers can buy flavour and nicotine separately and mix the two. Think it would be similar. Grape cannabis smokes all around
1414 2018-04-25 20:45:41 Needs to have a drip of oil on the floor to be spot on
1415 2018-04-25 20:45:33 It's worked on my dad once. He took my mom's car in for an oil change and left buying a car just like the loaner and trading in the original car.

1432 2018-04-25 20:43:29 Wow a big city like Calgary can’t afford a new stadium, if I was a resident I’d be questioning where all that oil money is going?????
1433 2018-04-25 20:43:14 Iceland cutting out palm oil is great.

Powerful people behave the same way all over world. They treat public servants as personal servants! On the other hand when power equation is in favor of police (vs Poor's/blacks) they take public as fodder to feed on!!! It is all about power. Democracy usirped by crooked.

1441 2018-04-25 20:41:44 gonna try adding more pigmented stuff to the lip oil...
1442 2018-04-25 20:41:35 It is very contradictory for @JustinTrudeau to stand in front of oil and gas workers telling them what they do matters and this pipeline is in the "nations interest" YET he is helping fund a protest group to STOP the pipeline.  You can't be on 2 sides of the fence to make face.

Saudi oil $$$$$ buying American corporates, which Iranian's dont understand !
Obama was a real statesman, he genuinely worked towards peace..
1455 2018-04-25 20:39:20 I learned the hard way: make sure your top coat overlaps the base coat just a tad, and go easy on the nail oil. Also, for me, I have to apply top coat daily, but I think my nails are naturally oily because even regular base coat pops off them.
1456 2018-04-25 20:39:18 And the Polish government should be concerned with the USA - a country that has been benefiting from sheltering Nazis for decades and invading other countries in order to get their oil.
1457 2018-04-25 20:39:12 @derekbmcneil Man oh man are you for real?? Have you not paid attention to the Tories'diabolical scheming? Tories cannot be trusted.

1526 2018-04-25 20:27:49 Kanye does his part by charging $300 for a plain white t shirt. That leaves less $ to use on environmentally damaging items. If everyone had to spend $300 on a t shirt no more oil production is needed.
1527 2018-04-25 20:27:34 Shouldn’t your man change your oil for you 
1528 2018-04-25 20:27:12 Oil isn't part of the Charter of Rights....
1529 2018-04-25 20:27:11 No new oil drilling off our coastal shores. No more coal burning fuels. Stop taken land away from our National parks. And don’t lift the band on hunting endangered wildlife.
1530 2018-04-25 20:26:49 The Democratic Party is determined to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.  As long as they adopt the same disdain for the working class as establishment Republicans, the metastasized cancer in our body politic will grow and be exploited by snake oil salesmen like Trumpolini.
1531 2018-04-25 20:26:49 It's okay to let the oil and gas extraction industry collapse...along with the forked tongue fake environmentalist politicians that support that industry. We'll be just fine...and, Mother Earth thanks you ~ Philamayelo.
1532 2018-04-25 20:26:28 Naw it just means your due an oil change service lol
1533 2018-04-25 20:26:27 It’s like you don’t learn... didn’t go so well the last time you jinxed them 
1534 2018-04-25 20:26:26 Forget the dumb scandals & focus on the corruption, them stealing billions with their tax plan, letting their friends buy 870 discounted houses from poor people that lost them, selling American lands to oil corporations, deregulating protections for profit.
1535 2018-04-25 20:26:20 I was looking at that oil before! Is it good on your face like does it break you out or anything? X
1536 2018-04-25 20:26:06 In today’s world, it’s hard to find inner Zen! That’s why I recommend #Balance to both new oil users as well as experienced users - because there are times where you just need time to focus on yourself! #doTERRA #Zen #balance #relax #grounding
1537 2018-04-25 20:26:05 What is it with mums n coconut oil?? Is anyone else’s mum obsessed or is it just mine? Cooking food? Coconut oil. Dry skin? Coconut oil? Split ends? Coconut oil. Broken leg? Yeh George just whack some coconut oil on it
1538 2018-04-25 20:26:03 @GasBuddyDan Serious question Dan...Does the Competition Bureau (a private, not-a-gov entity) do more harm or good, as far as preventing oil giants from abusing  the public with their market dominance? @FinancialMurder
1539 2018-04-25 20:25:56 no - there is clear evidence that building new pipelines incentivizes upstream oil production and lock-in pollution for decades into the future. Keeping oil in the ground is the only surefire way to prevent dangerous spills and climate pollution.
1540 2018-04-25 20:25:49 I took Lisa’s car to get inspected today and no only did her registration expire in February, but she didn’t have an up to date insurance card AND WAS 8,000 MILES OVER DUE FOR AN OIL CHANGE
1541 2018-04-25 20:25:48 How is palm oil vegan?

1546 2018-04-25 20:24:49 I got olive oil on my shirt. Stream cancelled.

1548 2018-04-25 20:24:39 I use the tan luxe oil on them and my face! Literally looks so much better than normal tan cos it’s dead even so you don’t end up looking mental
1549 2018-04-25 20:24:28 My oil change is $140 
1550 2018-04-25 20:24:28 Diego’s anniversary gift: $50 Dutch Bros gc 
My anniversary gift: oil change, tire rotation, alignment, new air filters and possible brake change.
1551 2018-04-25 20:24:23 I've read from Reuters that this may be tested in 2nd half of 2018. Makes sense since China is now buyer of crude oil.

Just I buy a new car GRANDE PUNTO 2012 year 1.3 multijet from ITALY but when I replace all the filters and oil my car just started to charge the oil. I don't have some other problems, only just oil charge. Please tell me which oil is best for this car?  #FiatCare

1559 2018-04-25 20:23:09 all breweries exist to make money, recipes also change, the quality of malt and hops change from year to year depending on harvest and also tastes, Beavertown’s Neck Oil in 2012 was a different beast to what it is now.

1561 2018-04-25 20:23:06 Want To Never Have To Pay For An Oil Change Again?
1562 2018-04-25 20:23:03 At the time I was getting an oil change for my mom
1563 2018-04-25 20:22:47 The NRA, FB, Google, Oil Companies, Hospitals,  Foreign Governments,  other communities spend mad money to build those type of relationships fake or not. Why hate on members of our community that do it.
1564 2018-04-25 20:22:46 You literally never EVER called me scrubbin’ bubbles I’m so confused
1565 2018-04-25 20:22:18 God bless you for his cost to the French president and about who pays the costs of protection The time has passed for the Churchill law and the oil countries have a lot of money America stole from the Bush era of 50 years
1566 2018-04-25 20:22:16 Someone mentioned other day Turnbull denied banking RC 21 times
Wasn't counting but not surprised
He's a snake oil salesman who hides his loot in the Caymas so he doesn't have to pay tax on it & is preferred over Shorten via polls ?
Says more abt Shorten than it does Turnbull
1567 2018-04-25 20:22:06 Ass taste like ass but when she got coconut oil on her but hole BOOM  Almonds joy 
1568 2018-04-25 20:21:55 Its literally called the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency to protect the environment. Fracking, oil drilling, tar sands, oils spills, deforestation are not protecting the environment. They want to rid actual science so they can input their false science into the EPA.
1569 2018-04-25 20:21:55 2 New products getting ready to launch soon!
I know 1 of them is THC FREE CBD Oil! Stand By!
Announcement tomorrow Evening!
1570 2018-04-25 20:21:51 Now if only the Cdn media would ask this question and hold him to an answer. Instead we get gush pieces. @macleans runs David Axleford and Telford love ins rather than questioning why the @liberal_party is using taxpayer $$ to fight the oil industry. The @CBCNews is also silent.

1574 2018-04-25 20:21:30 "you're like a rare holofoil boyfriend"
"did you just call me an olive oil boyfriend??"
1575 2018-04-25 20:21:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1576 2018-04-25 20:21:14 Only if you promise to oil yours up because I’m in need of a new mirror! 
1577 2018-04-25 20:20:54 Justin, I hate pipelines, pregnant women, oil, conservatives, Alberta, etc. Where’s my cheque.
Do I get a bonus for killing Americans like your other friends ?
1578 2018-04-25 20:20:50 You can point to individual wins, but big oil is still wrecking the planet. More and more places are being opened for drilling. Admittedly, technological trends are on your side, but for now--in this critical time--you're behind when we need you to be ahead.
1579 2018-04-25 20:20:36 Palm oil rice stays winning
1580 2018-04-25 20:20:22 Have you heard of/tried #CBD oil? Well worth checking out - fab for anxiety

No way! That needs to be an OIL PAINTING!
1582 2018-04-25 20:20:14 Just say no to canola oil.

1584 2018-04-25 20:19:52 I forgot to pack dry shampoo and that’s literally the worst mistake of my week  hello oil slick
1585 2018-04-25 20:19:42 meanwhile, Cnada is blocking pipelines and keep buying oil ... fuckedup world
1586 2018-04-25 20:19:40 Recognizing Suzuki’s body of work has nothing to do with the oil industry.
1587 2018-04-25 20:19:33 Ah I see! We older ones pretty calm, pups are usually active when it’s play time. BOL! M has lavender oil which helps us when we have anxiety
1588 2018-04-25 20:19:21 I would voluntarily swallow a tablespoon of avocado oil or coconut oil but I wouldn't canola oil or crisco oil

1590 2018-04-25 20:19:05 You have the right to independent thought, as should everyone, but his energy is undeniably toxic, many times cruel, serving the monied corporcacy. Snake Oil, not Dragon Energy WETF that is. Surprised you would align with that toxcicity. Just my humble independent thought.
1591 2018-04-25 20:19:02 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1592 2018-04-25 20:18:55 CBD oil also calms down the body's over reaction.
1593 2018-04-25 20:18:53 you persistently provide little islands of solace upon the oil fire that is the tl
1594 2018-04-25 20:18:36 Rachel, girlfriend: I believe u believe u r helping, but u will need more then $ Health Care 4 yr ppl if u keep the filthy tar sands issue sucking. Create jobs w/ green & renew,clean up r lands. U r too good 4 this further unhealthful behavior. No futures in Oil. Pls, 4 the young
1595 2018-04-25 20:18:30 But after US invaded for oil... Carpet bombed and murdered millions still Afg is a quagmire and hundreds get killed every other day... Taliban time was the most peaceful time.. But oh slave media
1596 2018-04-25 20:18:26 คิดมากอีกแล้ว. ทำใมช่วงนี้กุคิดบ่อยจัง
1597 2018-04-25 20:18:24 We are being directed towards a conflict with Iran. Loosening sanctions on Iran because of the nuclear deal increased oil supply. This reduced oil prices which is why Saudi ISIS have been less active (except Yemen). It has also hurt Russia. 

A war with Iran boosts the oil price.
1598 2018-04-25 20:18:21 For English speaking or for mismanagement of oil boom as number 2 CBN man or supervising heist against Nigerians by loading bullion vans with millions of dollars against money laundering act for Dasuki and co?

Refuse to be placated by smooth talking and sublime platitudes.

1600 2018-04-25 20:18:06 Do you know how the IRA was structured?  A tiny number of militia cells that collectively had veto power over peace - like KKK chapters do over @GOP policy. @NRA also do #KKKNRAGOP.

Then add big oil, big hospital, big ag & military pork contractors & base/prison workers & Likud.
1601 2018-04-25 20:18:03 Global scenario:
- Rising $
- Rising oil price
- Rising bond yields/short term borrowing rates
- Liquidity squeeze. Banks unwilling to lend
Indian #markets:
- cos. scaling all-time highs (TCS $100bn)
1602 2018-04-25 20:17:48 When his children are living in a nice house,,, driving a nice car,,,, eating 3 square food a day,,,, do nothing but stay and eat free oil
1603 2018-04-25 20:17:45 It would have saved Nigeria but ur town man GEJ blew the opportunity when the oil was booming.
1604 2018-04-25 20:17:38 Commerciogenic disease. The great public health challenges of our era are how to regulate Big Food, Big Alcohol, Big Oil and Big Tobacco. They want us to buy, buy, buy....and they cover-up the health consequences. @HughFW
1605 2018-04-25 20:17:33 How long is an oil change supposed to take because I've been here over an hour? 

Maybe if you talked less shit and worked more I wouldn't still be here. #WalmartBro
1606 2018-04-25 20:17:23 Instead of my usual moisturizer, I used jojoba + almond oil on my skin this morning. I'm not oily at all and my skin looks amazing. I might have to formulate a moisturizing serum for @WRBLMGC w this boi.
1607 2018-04-25 20:17:22 Omg! I'm I bad for laughing  oh god he must have felt a bit meh! Men and their beards these days xx hubby says olive oil grows it faster  x
1608 2018-04-25 20:17:14 I hate to break this to you: You're losing. Oil and gas have more money than you, and thus more influence.
1609 2018-04-25 20:17:14 Data is the new oil ??
1610 2018-04-25 20:17:06 Why not face ur fave's oil and leave Alex alone.
1611 2018-04-25 20:16:53 Repairs not oil changes. Oil changes use synthetic that’s why it gets pricey. It’s also because the cars are over engineered as in parts + materials used to make the parts. But you should what you’re getting yourself into..

1615 2018-04-25 20:16:01 Um, are you high? The rich arab gulf states were invented post ww2, and their riches are recent, because the WEST discovered oil and showed you how to pump it. Please don't be so eager to make a fool of yourself.
Not to mention, the need for arab oil has dropped significantly.
1616 2018-04-25 20:15:58 If it's vandora selling oil now I go understand
1617 2018-04-25 20:15:57 Appreciate dat my g. The black seed oil album dropping this summer.
1618 2018-04-25 20:15:55 Todays bearish action in oil unlikely completes the pullback imo. Mid 68s then another poke to below 67 I think
1619 2018-04-25 20:15:54 I didn't get to get paint while I was in LA and I really don't feel like using oil paint today ugh >_<

1623 2018-04-25 20:15:24 Oil made Norway one of the richest nation on earth, a country with the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The same as Qatar, UAE and other wealthy Gulf nations. It is people like you who are lazy lawmakers good at wailing rather than enacting useful laws for a progress.
1624 2018-04-25 20:15:19 Changing the oil in me car next of all the filter was the wrong so then the oil blew all over the place so I was snapping and put me foot down going in the garden and creamed the mirror of me gate gonna burn the thing

1627 2018-04-25 20:14:56 That why I say Michael Bloomberg is not a businessman but a snake oil salesman!
1628 2018-04-25 20:14:46 No, because now it conjures images of two cars leaking oil on a bed in a Russian hotel.
1629 2018-04-25 20:14:45 Thank fuck... you need an arse lift and bio oil to iron out the creases!

1633 2018-04-25 20:14:30 Kim for real don’t even argue with these people. It’s like peeling out in your car on oil. No matter what argument, they will try and make you wrong. If they’re wrong, they’ll just call you names. Woke people know he’s sane. Stay strong!!!!
1634 2018-04-25 20:14:25 What are you doing for the Indians which had high paying work in the oil fields until you virtually destroyed their livelihood?
1635 2018-04-25 20:14:22 @_madworm_ Had some pig;s liver in Spain recently. Loved it. (We usually have lamb's liver in Ireland.) Bought some here in Cork just now. Only €4.0 a kilo. Will fry with onions in olive oil tom. That's what the Spaniards do. Will report!

1644 2018-04-25 20:12:27 In conclusion, your motive was to criticize my proposed value model, tell me I'm selling snake oil, I have no credibility, call me a fanboy & laud your background in sports cards... twice. Now, why should I have a conversation with you? Best of luck to you!

1651 2018-04-25 20:11:05 no such thing as fossil fuels they were introduced to bring the idea of scarcity bones don’t turn to oil . Oil is self replenishing just like water

1653 2018-04-25 20:11:00 Yeah. There have always been successful snake oil salesmen and there always will be. No shocker there. But seriously if you think you can lecture me on moral nihilist you got several other things coming.

1668 2018-04-25 20:09:37 
1669 2018-04-25 20:09:32 And it still means more rail capacity being used up for oil sands production so even less for grain.
1670 2018-04-25 20:09:31 Had to goto the dealership & change my oil but niggas told me to be there before 330

1673 2018-04-25 20:09:12 I have studied oil markets for more than a decade and I'm well aware of that... but 2% is an order of magnitude larger than 0.2%.

1678 2018-04-25 20:08:54 @IcelandFoods i have to say THANK YOU so much on behalf of all the orangutans for cutting out palm oil. it's such a great step forward and i cant wait for more supermarkets to follow suit
1679 2018-04-25 20:08:52 Went in for an oil change, they found a pretty major issue. Got a complimentary rental car and jokingly ask the guy if he got my request for a 718, but a 911 would do. He very seriously says "I've got a Kia Soul". No my friend...no.
1680 2018-04-25 20:08:45 Nigeria issue is beyond me it's so glaring that we refuse to do the little things all we see is oil money and no other plans or means. If there is electricity 24hrs today ehn it's a big step stone

1685 2018-04-25 20:07:52 You’re the chemical engineer with industry experience, but I think you would need a rail car heater, a heavy oil upgrader, and a steady supply of much more flammable diluent to get the bitumen at the receiving coastal rail terminal into a tanker. Perfect!!

1690 2018-04-25 20:07:28 Kenya to host Blue Economy Summit in Nov to press its case for the greater exploitation of the seas for the benefit of citizens. Wonder what kind of exploitation that is? Oil? Gas? Mining? Ports operations? Pls, learn from previous mistakes in the region. @capecffa
1691 2018-04-25 20:07:18 I tried adding a drop of almond oil in my foundation, it really helps!!
1692 2018-04-25 20:07:16 You need to do more research.  A new refinery was opened near Edmonton in late 2017 - cost $10 billion.  Once oil is refined the products have to be shipped separately, which is a problem over long distances.  Best bet is probably partial upgrader - do more research.
1693 2018-04-25 20:07:09 Coddling greedy oil corporations is more important than equal rights? Nope! The majority of Canadians (across the voting spectrum) want to see us move off of oil. We should be investing waaay more into new tech and energies. It’ll be better for the economy & environment

1696 2018-04-25 20:06:57 "But China's capital acct isn't open."  Why would it need to be if China is running a large current acct surplus?  If an oil exporter has CNH, it can use that CNH to buy Chinese goods & roll any net surplus into CNY gold.  The real question is "Then who will fund US deficits?"
1697 2018-04-25 20:06:55 Actually the oil sands are quite a "natural" mess in the environment. Cleaning up these highly soiled and almost completely unusable areas is what they are trying to do. Once the oil is extracted, the soil is cleaned and new forests and grasslands are planted. Check it out.

1702 2018-04-25 20:06:11 Its not a conspiracy, just a lack of coverage. There are hundreds of small accidents that happen across a huge expanse of country. Not all of them are considered news worthy and not all of them will involve oil.
1703 2018-04-25 20:06:05 I mix up my own nail oil, its coconut oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin E oil, well, In my preferred mix the coconut wants to solidify in my cool apartment, so  i have to warm it. sometimes in the microwave, mostly under my big ol’ flappy boob.  Can you say you have that talent? lol
1704 2018-04-25 20:05:26 And the eco zealots will bankrupt our country even as we strive to intelligently convert from petrol prod to alternatives. Won't be any way to pay for the advances we need without admitting we'll need oil for the foreseeable future and KM is our best bet to fund that future.

1726 2018-04-25 20:03:15 You'd have to pull your head out of your ass to understand that, though. Hint: it's the last 50 years of American murder/intervention in the name of promoting regimes that will benefit American oil interests.

1728 2018-04-25 20:03:03 Killed by an oil slick. What a metaphor.
1729 2018-04-25 20:02:56 Well, guess what, I happen to know that only 0.5% of pipeline spills get reported. In fact almost every pipeline constantly leaks oil into wetlands! It's what Big Oil doesn't want you to know! See how easy bullshit is? Fun!
1730 2018-04-25 20:02:42 As a country we need to support being able to sell oil,as a province we should purchase from Canada B4 any other country when at all possible, but we should definitely be starting up the dormant refineries ASAP. The switch to electric in BC is very premature + we need to sell oil
1731 2018-04-25 20:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
1732 2018-04-25 20:02:27 Yellow garri is better than white garri because the later has a lot of Cyanide. The red oil in the yellow garri reduces the poisonous effect of the Cyanide.

1738 2018-04-25 20:01:39 Thoughts on oil Steve, you trade it?
1739 2018-04-25 20:01:36 Oh yes, temporary jobs. That's the thinking behind your thinking. What about all the oil spills across Canada that seldom hit the news? N.B. is not your province so why would you care eh? We already have millions of barrels each week travelling through towns and cities by train.
1740 2018-04-25 20:01:30 How much do they make in oil revenue and dividends?  Remove that money and those numbers are completely different.

1802 2018-04-25 19:51:35 This week has shown you to be a snake oil salesman, but that's every week.  Your slow-walking horsecrap is pathetic.

1805 2018-04-25 19:51:19 Praise the oil gods 
1806 2018-04-25 19:51:17 A normal one at the dealer should be like $45 with labor at the absolute most. But I think Toyota like to use synthetic oil so that’s prob why it’s higher

1808 2018-04-25 19:51:00 Vi sighed as she tapped away at the tablet on her desk. Being the Enforcer for a police department came with a lot of paperwork. After her departure from the law for some time, she had almost forgotten. And even though she was burning the late-night oil, she was almost finished.-

1810 2018-04-25 19:50:43 #HealthyAppetite Watching A Healthy Appetite on @rte - Replacing butter with coconut oil? Hmm. Not sure what to make of this show yet. Awareness is great but we don't eat in restaurants everyday either! Great to see @Dublin_Cookery featured - loved my course there!
1811 2018-04-25 19:50:16 As an alumnus, I am glad Dean issued letter, but it should be stronger.  Suzuki is not worthy of this recognition, he deliberately misled public on oil, GMO’s and fish farming and perhaps more.  He is a propagandist; hardly a scientist.  @UAlberta needs to rescind.
1812 2018-04-25 19:50:10 Thanx for the update. I can't watch the charade and lies of minions of a snake oil salesman.
1813 2018-04-25 19:50:03 That's the part I like the most. Many can't see all the work that's needed to get to the end result. I decided to call it "Paint's Stacking". These are the necessary building blocks to go through, mainly when using oil paint. We'll be waiting for the final result. 
1814 2018-04-25 19:50:02 Oil but not enough.... So illegal in GA and IMO it'll be one of the last.
1815 2018-04-25 19:50:01 What do have to say about Jason Kenney demanding David Suzuki not get an honorary degree due to his oil sands views?
1816 2018-04-25 19:50:00 Can we install those in oil companies too?
1817 2018-04-25 19:49:53 Ask her how she feels about Wagner PMC mercenaries being enlisted by Russian private companies to launch assaults on Kurdish held oil fields in exchange for oil concessions from the Syrian state.
1818 2018-04-25 19:49:51 Looks lovely.
I do favor roasting cauliflower in a bit of a bastardized polonaise.
Breadcrumbs,olive oil, grated hard cooked eggs, s&p, Parmesan, parsley, nutmeg & cayenne. Slice cauli 1/2" thick. Mix well.

1821 2018-04-25 19:49:15 @Schar_UK so disappointed you too use nutrient-free starch as your main ingredient. Also sunflower oil. I will #boycott all companies doing this #glutenfree
1822 2018-04-25 19:49:03 Lol she got me on the wave, face scrubs, creams, coco oil, aloe Vera plant etc.. she don got me together
1823 2018-04-25 19:49:02 This sounds to me like the 'washing your hair less often will make it less greasy' -- like, ok, but what do I do in the meantime while I'm waiting for my skin/hair/etc to STOP PRODUCING OIL.
1824 2018-04-25 19:48:38 lmao they cute tho. spreading some oil btwn the parts is rly soothing.

1827 2018-04-25 19:48:18 I have literally never heard 'moisturizer helps you produce less oil'.  That's a new one to me!  I mean, I put on a firming/anti-aging moisturizer at night... but jeez.
1828 2018-04-25 19:48:17 Baltzell??
Is that a type of engine oil?

U wan jam tipper bah?
1829 2018-04-25 19:48:13 Today, I couldn’t remember the word “vape”, so I said “use with an oil vaporization apparatus.”

1830 2018-04-25 19:48:07 i wont lie, i made threats. 

" IF YALL DONT DEVELOP SOME SORT OF HEALTHY BALANCE WITH THIS STUPID GAME ILL POUR HOT OIL ON IT WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP " 

mild stuff like that.
1831 2018-04-25 19:48:00 Milner is the oil in the engine that's in our rolls.
1832 2018-04-25 19:47:53 What industry will create jobs? Automation is replacing 30 or 40 percent of jobs and oil is being replaced with electricity. Respectfully what is your jobs plan Mr Kenney? And who is the one paying to retool workers and industry?
1833 2018-04-25 19:47:50 2. Some say the AB oil discount is a function of refining cost, and the KM business case made more sense in 2013 than it does today with more pipeline capacity to get lighter oil to ports that can ship 3x as much per tanker as Vancouver. I don't know, but that worries me.

1840 2018-04-25 19:47:18 Same here! I know that wearing more moisturizer “ helps” your skin produce less oil, but like.... I just sweat that shit off lmao.

1843 2018-04-25 19:46:49 OK!  1. If oil price go as low as $30/barrel, how do you intend to do it and from where do u source for money. 2. What kind of rail will u build in Lagos considering the congestion of the state. Thank you!

1855 2018-04-25 19:45:19 wow..... you're right...... %40 is going to bring Washington state to it's knees........ it's a damn good thing that Washington State can't ship oil on from other states....
ha ha ha ha ........
1856 2018-04-25 19:45:18 The oil compounds (which add acidity) in the coffee aren't released since the water isn't hot enough to release them. Additionally, my younger sister tells me that cold brew forces you to taste the coffee not the roast.
1857 2018-04-25 19:45:13 "if u pull up to a garage and u gotta get a oil change and there's a women working in there. Men and women would prefer it done by a man...I mean I'm all for women's right but I also want my car to run good"

1858 2018-04-25 19:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1859 2018-04-25 19:44:54 I know the benefits of coconut oil pulling but the thought of swishing coconut oil in my mouth sounds so disturbing.
1860 2018-04-25 19:44:46 finished doing my entire makeup then went in with the milani make it dewy spray & nothing but oil came out & ruined EVERYTHING 
1861 2018-04-25 19:44:22 They can't #Saudi own us and the USA, we have to do what we're told, they will just take away the oil and all their money and watch our economies collapse

1875 2018-04-25 19:43:19 What is being missed is that restart of the historic gold settlement for oil trade creates a dynamic that is still playing-out.

1896 2018-04-25 19:40:24 Only problem I have with this is the transition period.  We need a solid current energy policy to help fund the  new energy, we need infrastructure to support new energy. We are easily 10yrs away if not 15.  We still need the oil sector

1902 2018-04-25 19:39:11 Iran is not pro Russia. They just hate Russia less than the “Great Satan” and can use them. Iran can’t operate alone in the world with the price of oil so low.

1913 2018-04-25 19:37:10 In each sector I aim for 1 of each

Safe, expected revenue & NAV growth targeting 100% return

Low Risk, probable  revenue & NAV growth = 2 - 300%

Wild Card, hoped revenue & NAV growth = 5- 1000%

In the oil & gas sector this year

Safe= AMER
Low Risk= AEX
Risky= ROSE

Any more?

1920 2018-04-25 19:36:11 PXD, high beta oil stock, near all time highs, has been building a huge base since 2-2017. 

ideally consolidates here - has come far quickly, then breaks out. i'm setting an alert
1921 2018-04-25 19:36:07 I'm unclear on your point. More importantly you seem unclear on mine. Oil pipelines aren't just "a thing", they represent a safer way to transport a dangerous material than the trains currently being used. 

Can we agree on that?
1922 2018-04-25 19:35:27 Emerging trend suggests market has deviated from its multi-yr view that ~$80 oil price is needed to maintain supply once inventory surplus is worked off (we are officially there now). If true, it means that prices will not move back up the old curve till this new view changes.

1924 2018-04-25 19:35:11 @ChrisEvans watched Gifted today. I loved the authenticity of the oil under the nails, even in scenes where you weren't playing with an engine but, I found the screwing an invisible screw and the use of a ratchet when there wasn't a bolt very distracting. Lovely film though.

1932 2018-04-25 19:34:21 Oh I wouldn't close them before their life cycle is up because as long as there is any coal/gas/oil in the mix they have to be better than that - I'm more interested in whether we'll ever see a new one. Eg I doubt coal will ever see a new plant started later than say, 2025.

1934 2018-04-25 19:34:17 Can you recollect some of the interesting oil and gas stories that caught your attention this year?  #OilandGasIndex
1935 2018-04-25 19:34:16 To be honest, so would the right ... okay ... maybe not burning it down, but we'd be on the lawns of every courthouse & officials homes with pitchforks demanding that they leave the family alone.
1936 2018-04-25 19:34:14 Horst Greczmiel: #Oil and #gas industry is among the top four most litigated #NEPA cases.
1937 2018-04-25 19:34:11 the internet told me to swish coconut oil in my mouth for 20 minutes so obviously i did it and all i got out of it was a stomach ache
1938 2018-04-25 19:34:04 NDA bungled the in spite of revenue windfall due to collapse of oil prices,spectrum coal auction  reduce subsidy fiscal deficit uncontrolled this govt should be thrown out before any other damage to economy
1939 2018-04-25 19:33:48 I do like the Oil blast @JDTrey22
1940 2018-04-25 19:33:45 We'll be progressing our test image of colour pencils using blending powder and carrying on with our next oil painting. Both underway presently #cornwallhour. However you enjoy your free time, do what inspires you. Have a great week everyone.
1941 2018-04-25 19:33:42 Haha 80 yeara ago and they say Liverpool fans live in the past. Yes from Dublin not all clubs can be manufactured with oil money, most need a global fanbase. You wouldn't understand that not having one.

Plus understand attendance just fine not a complicated concept.
1942 2018-04-25 19:33:41 Time is running out. Cut off BC oil now!
1943 2018-04-25 19:33:41 Ameen...Ya Sheikh din Oil

1949 2018-04-25 19:32:59  although I have oil stains on the carpet which is the equivalent.
1950 2018-04-25 19:32:59 Bayern wasted many chances. Maybe Real haunt them again.
1951 2018-04-25 19:32:58 I am on a damn crusade against that. It's snake oil get rich quick nonsense.
1952 2018-04-25 19:32:56 Navas' glove is made of premium olive oil!
1953 2018-04-25 19:32:49 Biz you've been a great addition to @spittinchiclets.  You guys keep it up.  More stuff about the Oil always welcome!!
1954 2018-04-25 19:32:47 At what point do 604 residents get pissed of enough at @bcndp and big oil to decide to have a general strike? I think it’s the only way to enact change. If your job or commute involves using gasoline, refuse to work for a day. Families can’t afford this! #strikeforfairgasprices
1955 2018-04-25 19:32:27 I highly recommend adding spiced beef that has been fried to an absolute crisp in some good fat like coconut oil. And poppadums.
1956 2018-04-25 19:32:26 This has been in the works for so long even 60 Minutes mocked it in the 80's.
1957 2018-04-25 19:32:07 Apparently old guys get pissy when you refer to oil as Engine Sauce.
1958 2018-04-25 19:31:59 Instead of buying an oil company in a search for yield, get $HDV etf which already has $XOM
1959 2018-04-25 19:31:52 None of the matches announced appeal to me at all and man I feel so weird that there a NO women’s match at all. If this is just some fantasy booking by some Saudi oil guy it’s a no for me.
1960 2018-04-25 19:31:48 @CBCVancouver Please ALSO include analysts who are more objective than @GasBuddyDan when discussing gas & oil industry. His POV is very one-sided and he's very abrasive with/about those who differ...Thanks!
1961 2018-04-25 19:31:44 Essential items like pomade, beard balm, beard comb, texture paste, beard oil and mens perfume.
1962 2018-04-25 19:31:43 So this girl is walking behind me into the shop where I’m getting my oil change and this guy was checking her out and then in comes her gf 
1963 2018-04-25 19:31:41 Replaced an old pensotti oil boiler at a local town hall today with a new buderus boiler
1964 2018-04-25 19:31:22 Add some olive oil and some garlic and you've got yourself a keen and aromatic reduction. If you can't overpower, embellish!
1965 2018-04-25 19:31:20 Try on scrap. Linseed  oil. Leave 1 week. Rub hard with brickdust (substitute  burnt umber!) On a rag. Leave for another  week.

1967 2018-04-25 19:31:02 So another advantage of palm kernel oil is it makes your hair super dark! #naturaloils

1975 2018-04-25 19:30:25 Mountain Town Olive Oil Co. Redditors explain kafkaesque:
1976 2018-04-25 19:30:21 #Household #Hint.  To remove adhesive stickers from glass, soak in vegetable oil for a couple of minutes and remove.
1977 2018-04-25 19:30:15 Not starting up refineries in BC, but shipping more expensive refined in U.S. oil up the coast from instead of buying it from AB (supporting local jobs) is pretty stupid.  Not allowing the pipeline to sell the oil to China isn't exactly economically wise either.
1978 2018-04-25 19:30:04 Oil is sold out but she is doing giveaway of same oil...

Or is it another oil?
1979 2018-04-25 19:30:01 Call me
1980 2018-04-25 19:29:57 I would love to oil her up
1981 2018-04-25 19:29:54 SENATOR IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE WORLD ;GOD LABORED FOR 6 DAYS! SCIENTISTS HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION! TELL THEM EXPLAIN THE COMPOSITION OF OIL THAN WE CAN HAVE A TRUE CONVERSATION!
1982 2018-04-25 19:29:02 WTI oil at $67.57/barrel, down $0.13.
1983 2018-04-25 19:28:55 The last trading day for speculators (cannot buy or sell physical oil) is 8 days before expiry, going to be interesting to see if there is price spikes on that 8th day as these speculators try to get out of their positions while those buying and selling physical oil stay in
1984 2018-04-25 19:28:51 Can of Oil!! 
1985 2018-04-25 19:28:45 In a blender: 1 small shallot peeled/chopped 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp honey 1 tea soy sauce 1/2 cup apple cider vin 2 tbsp red wine 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice - blend well - with motor running slowly add 1 and 1/2 cups canola oil blending until smooth. Season to taste. 
1986 2018-04-25 19:28:29 Oil spill boy, oil spills everywhere
1987 2018-04-25 19:28:24 The current state of the UK makes me sick.
1988 2018-04-25 19:28:19 Works for a while. As you get the bottom of your dressing, the mustards been mostly used up and the oil will separate. I use only EVOO so, it gets solidified at that point and its necessary to shake after I take it out of the fridge. Good tip though

1993 2018-04-25 19:27:40 That's when oil was at 100 a barrel we are getting gouged big time just like the cable companies one last cash grab

2006 2018-04-25 19:26:05 The shock will be long-term in my opinion (not due to Iran either.)  This time around, the green side has brainwashed so many people into thinking #oil is dying & made it impossible to build pipelines/takeaway capacity. SE Saskatchewan will be very prosperous again soon.
2007 2018-04-25 19:25:57 I've said it before, ama say it again. This gentlemagic oil is the one yho

2013 2018-04-25 19:25:03 Sunflower, pumpkin and sesame seeds plus some cinnamon mixed with golden linseed , almond flour, eggs and hemp oil,
2014 2018-04-25 19:25:00 It is 'Oil' not Oli
2015 2018-04-25 19:24:59 Guilty as charged. My job takes me from suit and tie one minute to crawling under a lorry the next to investigate an oil leak. I buy wet wipes by the box.

I am not ashamed 

You know, for moments like this. I can avert disaster a bit 
2016 2018-04-25 19:24:48 Wipes - they literally get everything out - sticky fingers, red wine out of sofas, oil based paint off of hands etc
2017 2018-04-25 19:24:43 im getting my oil changed and a redneck guy here has "stay together for the kids" by blink-182 as his ringtone.

2019 2018-04-25 19:24:12 ° Boss had enough, she got angry as she would reach up and smack both of them. The same way she smacked Tip's ass when she used her olive oil, it's easy to say that her snack packed a SERIOUS force behind it. °

2023 2018-04-25 19:23:55 @theresa_may  hi Theresa could I ask you not to penalise people with diesel car / vans but ask the oil company’s to make diesel cleaner they have made billions of profits and should be Accountable thank you craig
2024 2018-04-25 19:23:53 The Devil's Chessboard highlights all the enemies the Kennedy boys made - the top officers in each branch of the armed forces, the oil industry, the steel industry, the husbands of all the women they were sleeping with. Those two had no shortage of people who wanted to harm them.
2025 2018-04-25 19:23:50 I ordered "Toms of Maine" was a best seller on Amazon, see how it goes, I love this fluoride free mouthwash though, mostly coconut oil, but it's been great
2026 2018-04-25 19:23:47 This guy hella stopped and stared @ me for a min creepin like he hasn’t seen a girl put oil in her car 
2027 2018-04-25 19:23:34 No just Gamma & Neck Oil but it's not to be on sale until 30th so that may come
2028 2018-04-25 19:23:30 @bcalmanac the irony here is that ppl hate dirty oil but still consume bc the infrastructure/energy  is fossil fuel dependent. Ppl don’t have power.,To convert take decades & huge investments. It’s just a new era
2029 2018-04-25 19:23:25 Oil refineries & transportation are sitting ducks. Without cash from oil, Iran faces big probs from outside & within.  Folks who dove in to do business after sanctions lifted will face unplanned commercial trouble.  Iran won’t roll over but they’re no match for US weapons.
2030 2018-04-25 19:23:20 Exactly...our standing on the political spectrum or our reliance on oil as a commodity mean nothing. We are told what to do, and we obey. It's really that simple. 
Pecore castrate.
2031 2018-04-25 19:23:13 High power lens called : oil immersion 
But what is the name of oil 
I think is oil immersion like its name
2032 2018-04-25 19:23:07 Remember the good old days when most of Canadian crude oil was conventional and therefore was higher value to begin with. Moving remaining conventional crude to markets in Quebec & Atlantic Canada seems to be best solution. #cdnpoli

2035 2018-04-25 19:22:58 Thursday I will be attending the Oil Patch TRTA meeting. I will provide a public safety presentation. Situational awareness, exit strategies, and more will be discussed. #e3speaks #keynotespeaker
2036 2018-04-25 19:22:56 As I see it, the environmental movement has two levers: trying to impede the oil sands (cutting supply), and trying to push up carbon prices (cutting demand). Given resistance on the Canadian right to carbon pricing, I think more attention to carbon pricing would be helpful.
2037 2018-04-25 19:22:52 about 10 years ago or so, natural gas was discovered underneath the water. Also, we all know about Oil in Kuwait/Iraq/Kurdistan and Syria is "bridge" connecting those pipelines to one all way towards Gaza, making Israeli have a viable product 2 export 2/2
2038 2018-04-25 19:22:37 I heard some about castor oil

2043 2018-04-25 19:21:44 Yes I hold 3 oil stocks and one penny
2044 2018-04-25 19:21:37 People who claim to envision a future without oil need to think about whether the jurisdictional/environmental arguments invented to stop pipelines will be used to block electricity transmission projects, rail lines etc. that their vision will require.

2046 2018-04-25 19:21:17 The government worked with the Saudis on 911. Not sure why exactly but related to immigration. My best guess Saudis saw the end of oil so they bribed or threatened usa to take in Islamic immigrants. One way to get that started was 911. The Barcelona agreement was similar.
2047 2018-04-25 19:21:11 Hydrates and tones. It's better when mixed with hazel but it's great especially in summer because it hydrates without oil
2048 2018-04-25 19:21:07 You forgot Oklahoma City with fertilizer and coal oil

2050 2018-04-25 19:21:04 I do think there is an issue with snake oil salesmen telling HTs that they “need” their services if they want to be outstanding.

2052 2018-04-25 19:20:53 Also cold pressed is utter marketing bullshit nicked from olive oil production copywriting bullshit - like pan fried, that's how you fry, ie as if you'd hot press a smoothie! #marketingwank
2053 2018-04-25 19:20:44 After I get my oil changed &  lashes and my toes done tomorrow you gone have to book an appointment to get next to me 
2054 2018-04-25 19:20:40 You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette. It would be good to have some more refinerys. Due to the low quality of bitumen, we sell our dirty oil at a large discount, as much as $40 per barrel less than full market price.  A refined product we would get full market price.

2058 2018-04-25 19:19:36 I accidentally spilled essential oil on my backpack so now I reek of lemongrass. If anyone needs to focus and destress, come sniff my backpack.
2059 2018-04-25 19:19:36 as expected u did not understand what u tweeted yourself..let me do the math for you.. A 400 point loss on 20 short positions is 160 million dollars...anyway oil never had a 400 pt rise or fall.
2060 2018-04-25 19:19:35 I was in oil service industry in the 70-80's. I only saw Heathrow. Maybe one day.
2061 2018-04-25 19:19:17 Throw that in a pan with oil and fry it. Side note: u can dip the cheese in flour before frying if u want it to be crunchy/crispy like.
2062 2018-04-25 19:19:16 Bio Oil saves lives with scars x
2063 2018-04-25 19:19:12 Rail and truck moving oil across the country is much more hazardous than a pipeline.
2064 2018-04-25 19:19:06 And...prices can vary from day to day with no rhyme or reason. I think Trump’s mouth and attitude toward the Mideast is driving up oil prices. Gas prices were the lowest in years under Obama.

Where are those profits moving to? I had you chart BTE a while back.. it has broken well above the downtrend line

2071 2018-04-25 19:17:43 Thanks to our pass governments from here the USA in the pass 30 years for all the money and weapons and planes we sold them for a bunch of dam oil that we didn't need now they kill even if they just fill like doing it. There's one why of striking back and hurting them deeply.
2072 2018-04-25 19:17:25 Who’s been spilling the oil? Last week or the week before, there was a similar case. Kinoti and your team, over to you.
2073 2018-04-25 19:17:19 Try tubing it with a little vegetable oil - that might shift the gas if it is actually bloat. But be very careful that you tube it into the stomach, not the trachea. Listen for gurgling noises in the tube. Alternatively, use a knob of margarine and push gently into mouth.
2074 2018-04-25 19:17:15 Will do. Hun. Just need to apply some more  oil to those chair legs!!!!

 Drink it: Add 1-2 drops of therapeutic-grade grapefruit essential oil in glass of water and drink after waking up. It helps to improve metabolism, fat loss, detoxify the body by flushing out toxins, and help to maintain your weight.
2085 2018-04-25 19:16:07 Connect the dots: science tells us to wean off oil; Big Oil is major GOP donor; hence GOP has to pretend to be anti-science. Wherever you see evil, it’s all about greed.

2108 2018-04-25 19:13:43 I fell prey to homeononsense pedlars when I was desperately trying to stop drinking - you guys very happy to take my money for snake oil.

2109 2018-04-25 19:13:41 Come up with nominations that doesn't  have a bad track records to start. Look at the people that you have now. Most were/are corporate CEOs and have ties to oil, power and mining. You brought your criminals with you.

2125 2018-04-25 19:12:10 The girl said to me eye makeup is fine you can use miscellar water to get it off as long as there’s no oil in it, might be worth asking
2126 2018-04-25 19:11:48 Cool, good to know. I personally don't mind using synthetic but figured the reason some people use coconut oil is to avoid the man-made stuff. So, thought I'd post the question. Thank you for the info. 
2127 2018-04-25 19:11:35 When oil hits 100 or 120 per barrel, the pipeline will officially be dead. No one will be hurting in Alberta anymore, exploration will be full bore again, and people will forget about Kinder Morgan as the money starts flowing again. -Nostradamus, 1563 A.D

2129 2018-04-25 19:11:14 Maybe, "oil" prices on Yahoo finance? Oil has different quotes. Light sweet crude at depot in Cushing OK might be best price.
2130 2018-04-25 19:11:01 Because we don't want to annoy big brother. Now with this nut job in Washington we are tied even more. Why did Keystone get approved so quickly? We are sending more of our cheap oil now to Texas to refine and they are selling it at a higher price.

2138 2018-04-25 19:09:21 Why is olive oil cake on so many menus in NYC?  Could it be that the margins are spectacular on a $12 dessert of bread and oil?
2139 2018-04-25 19:09:15 I was not known or big enough they say but in all honesty they could not see the oil.

2141 2018-04-25 19:08:51 The imaginary buyer journey I'd go down (and often do) is that things like Neck Oil are case fillers that mean they can fill the cast they're having to order to get the fancy shit.

2148 2018-04-25 19:07:38 also the upgraded "oilsands" oil isn't low grade. It is BETTER than WTI !
2149 2018-04-25 19:07:37 OH my gosh Chris SERIOUSLY???  That is totally obnoxious! Disheartening. I lived with a woman that takes care of birds of prey. She was involed the Alaskan oil spill as well. She is also on a Garth Brooks video setting an Eagle free which she does after rehibilitation quite often
2150 2018-04-25 19:07:35 Considering her cooking she should make an olive oil bottle.
2151 2018-04-25 19:07:23 I made myself an smoothie with spinach, kale, almond milk, and mct oil. *pls brain juice work pls*
2152 2018-04-25 19:07:20 Also almond oil 
2153 2018-04-25 19:07:14 OIL DIFF: 5.74 -> 5.88
2154 2018-04-25 19:07:08 Ok, so what we need is an extremely lifelike baby simulator.  The casual viewer cannot be able to tell the difference.

And we have the 'parent' wearing a neoprene liner, so that the 'baby', which has a coating of urushiol oil, doesn't affect them.

That will teach them.
2155 2018-04-25 19:07:07 RT BothanCeol: Just saw a TV ad for HopeCBD, for comparison their oil has 300mg CBD in 20ml for £29.99, our LoveCBD has 300mg CBD in 10ml for £18.99 #shoplocal
2156 2018-04-25 19:07:04 Found the commie! Sorry Kelly! Corporations are people too! Any spills magically disappear in a few thousand years, so relax. Solar power is fake news anyways. Chernobyl didn't stop nuclear, so why should oil stop? Fact: Fish don't vote.

2163 2018-04-25 19:06:35 Yeah no, in the end it turns out it was in reference to Canola Oil, not the car-juice stuff, but when that shirt is first shown there's no explanation so I was really thrown for a loop.
2164 2018-04-25 19:06:13 DWT rising WITH the price of oil??!!

2170 2018-04-25 19:05:39 CNY is not going to dethrone USD & China is not going to monopolize the oil market.  These are straw men arguments - the real story is what unfunded US deficits mathematically do to LIBOR & the USD once global CB's no longer need to fund US deficits as result of multi-ccy oil.
2171 2018-04-25 19:05:19 My friend has literally the same model down to the engine year color and wheels and has the same oil leaks. These videos could help me help him on a budget and if I decide I like him enough.

2174 2018-04-25 19:05:03 I can well imagine his frustration with the way things are. Anti-vaxxers, homeopaths and "natural remedies" snake oil salespeople, Gwyneth Paltrow style Goop and everyone thinking because they can Google their symptoms that they know better than the doctor.

If they want to sell snake oil, that is proven not to work, that’s fraud.
2181 2018-04-25 19:03:58 Is it foundation, umpa-lumpa oil or bronzing liquid that he uses??
2182 2018-04-25 19:03:52 Its time for the citizens to take away per Diem's as they just seem to be fleecing Alaskans. How about all extra money needed for overtime and extended sessions come from oil tax credits accounts. What are the legislators doing about Alaska petrol prices?
2183 2018-04-25 19:03:36 SEC covered and cannabis oil then dipped in Kief?
2184 2018-04-25 19:03:32 Got stuck behind a train for 15 minutes, was late for a client, blew my speakers in my car, broke a fresh set of nails, my oil maintenance required came on just now, and now I’m on my way to see my orthopedic surgeon. Y’all pray for me, I don’t think I’m makin it today
2185 2018-04-25 19:03:21 it is! aloe vera, sunflower oil & jojoba oil.
2186 2018-04-25 19:03:00 oil, try the first aid beauty moisturizer!!!!

2188 2018-04-25 19:02:39 y’all realize oil changes are just a knob on the bottom of your car that u just untwist and drain then fill with your cars oil type oil cost like 5 gallons of oil cost $25 so places b taxin yall 
2189 2018-04-25 19:02:36 yes because it takes the oil out of your skin but make sure you use a different facial cleanser before so you're skin can get used to it
2190 2018-04-25 19:02:30 baby oil is amazing.
2191 2018-04-25 19:01:39 There are solutions. Its the oil and gas industry that refuses to accept them.
2192 2018-04-25 19:01:36 One illiterate Okie, still believes in the Stanley Steamer and dial phones. Never met a contribution from an oil company he  did not like. OKs life expectancy for women has actually DECREASED even with a female (GOP) governor.

Changing our anthem is a joke. Not to mention how he's treated our oil sands, he doesn't care about Canadians at all
2199 2018-04-25 19:00:47 Ah, somewhat like whale oil.
2200 2018-04-25 19:00:42 Oil States argued that history dictates that patent validity be determined in a court of law. Turns out, history says otherwise: From 16th through 20th centuries, English #patents were subject to revocation by a group of "Privy Counsellors." #patentlaw #history
2201 2018-04-25 19:00:36 So you're going single-handedly going to make world oil prices go over $100 A barrel? BS
2202 2018-04-25 19:00:34 Oil prices rising. NPA rising, affecting investment. Employment dropping. Can the centre hold?
2203 2018-04-25 19:00:34 I love how Andy says "breaking news" but its a meme! The new politics is so awesome. Just stoke people's anger towards others. An attack on oil is an attack on us all. Let's not give into liberal nonsense about pollution or clean energy. FACT: The world is an infinite trashcan.

2210 2018-04-25 18:59:52 if you go on amazon, you can get bundles (shampoo, conditioner +other things added) for a decent price. I love their coconut line and their Jamaican castor oil line. I’ve been hooked for the last month on both and REALLY see a difference.
2211 2018-04-25 18:59:50 Ja, thanks to the strikers, the protests, the war in Syria, the global oil price spikes, profiteering, racketeering, and general incompetence. It's bad news as always. Rising food prices but no one gives a damn. it's all avarice.
2212 2018-04-25 18:59:37 1990 and i think before the price of oil shot up the first of your five (same number of european cups we have funnily enough) was 1968

2215 2018-04-25 18:59:16 Well tbh! I don’t like chips.. coz 1. I just don’t like em much hhah and 2. It’ll make me ill haha coz of the excess oil lol (acidity problems) 
2216 2018-04-25 18:59:16 Do i need a broker to invest in oil?  Any suggestions?
2217 2018-04-25 18:58:47 Me too.. Like how in the hell did her hair grow so fast and so thick? We need that Vibranium oil
2218 2018-04-25 18:58:45 Just saw a TV ad for HopeCBD, for comparison their oil has 300mg CBD in 20ml for £29.99, our LoveCBD has 300mg CBD in 10ml for £18.99 #shoplocal
2219 2018-04-25 18:58:25 KM spokesperson at an open house says, once an oil is looaded onto a ship at port, any spill becomes the responsibility of the shipping company, which more oftent han not is froma different country.
2220 2018-04-25 18:58:22 Hahahahaha tweet of the day we go to war to help you out in your hunt for oil
2221 2018-04-25 18:58:21 U.K., France, Saudie, maybe other Arab States, & Turkey, Germany.  Israel if Hamas is reckless. Russia makes $$ on 2 things:  Oil & armament. Iran is flush with cash, Russia isn’t.  Russia will be happy to keep gains in Ukraine, Georgia & Syria.  Iran will be in for rough times.
2222 2018-04-25 18:58:19 Of course, we won't "phase out" Canada's energy sector. Fossil fuel energy maybe over decades, but that's only a part of our energy. Some fossil fuels are still bridge fuels to a more sustainable environment. Nobody in their right mind advocates "cold turkey" withdrawal from oil.
2223 2018-04-25 18:58:00 @JustinTrudeau, as you have so boldly stated over and over again today that you would protect the right of Canadians to express themselves, I feel that I should too. The fact that we are buying Oil from Countries that do not have to adhere to our own standards is absurd.
2224 2018-04-25 18:57:57 We just got some new *Dr. Jolly's RSO * Rick Simpson Oil * 1 Gram Candy Kush Extract 1A401030000E4EA000007522*

It’s easy af.
2226 2018-04-25 18:57:32 @realDonaldTrump For the record, we know if you weasel out of the Iran deal, the Russian oil interests would win. Imagine that. <fiddle playing>
2227 2018-04-25 18:57:06 I wanna know how it grew that fast. I need that vibranium Wakanda castor oil!
2228 2018-04-25 18:57:06 Wonder how many of those bonds were purchased by PSU oil companies who are now recovering money from citizens..
2229 2018-04-25 18:57:05 There is no more trust in the EPA.  The changes are completely politicized simply by putting Pruitt in office.  He bathes in crude oil and corruption.  And farms lobbyists that are true to his pocketbook.

2231 2018-04-25 18:56:58 $48 for a synthetic oil change I’ll take that 
2232 2018-04-25 18:56:25 And because moisturizer is thicker than oil, it should be applied last. Although some people do it the other way around. Try to get your hands on a small sample to test it out. Tea tree oil has worked wonders on my acne prone areas
2233 2018-04-25 18:56:22 The @CPC_HQ claim that the oil sector creates jobs, but doesn't want to admit that it was the cause of Alberta's economy going down hill and people lost their jobs. #kindermorgan will do nothing for BC or Canada. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet #CPCFascism #CPCBigots
2234 2018-04-25 18:56:19 Am seeking those who are interested in Nigeria crude oil and is ready to buy. If u are a buyer be rest assured I will not allow u spend even a cent of ur dollar till u have your crude at your port of destination.
Nigeria is blessed with God fearing people who do business too.
2235 2018-04-25 18:56:06 I’ve never seen the oil, I’ll have to look for it. Sounds like you have a great summer planned.
2236 2018-04-25 18:56:03 They are throwing money at everyone but I dunno...I feel like the product is largely snake oil.  Like the new "fish oil"....I could be wrong..need to try it for myself
2237 2018-04-25 18:56:00 nasdaq posi, oil off the lows looks like we might have the makings of a stock market that wants to rally. yesterday big plunge was what I would call a search for the bottom and I think we might have found it. BUY THE DIPS and SELL the rallies is still in play

2240 2018-04-25 18:55:49 Your suggestion would be far more equitable than the current system which places a heavy burden on truck drivers. The paperwork and expense of fuel tax reporting is onerous. Replace with national rate at POS. Quit subsidizing oil companies too!!!
2241 2018-04-25 18:55:48 Trump has hired more than 40 officials with close ties to the Koch Brothers. They are pushing to shrink the size of government, cut aid for the needy, lower corporate taxes, loosen environmental regulations and open up public land to oil and gas extraction.
2242 2018-04-25 18:55:42 Why does a nation running a current acct surplus need a big open capital account?  Oil exporters holding CNH can exchange for Chinese goods & CNH gold with any net surplus.  Loser in this game is the USD flows.
2243 2018-04-25 18:55:31 If We back out of the deal, wont that create great demand for Russian oil, weaking sanctions in place on Russia???
2244 2018-04-25 18:55:23 it's cool to load your mid-day garlic bread up with medicated oil, right?
2245 2018-04-25 18:55:05 I said the same thing until I realized I could put my own oil in the pens. Now I’m just getting inconspicuously blazed everywhere

fuck what is wrong with these people
2253 2018-04-25 18:53:56 Get you some peppermint oil. One drop of it on your hands will mask any smell.

2254 2018-04-25 18:53:55 Anyone use oil facial cleanser ? Can you actually see a difference with your skin?
2255 2018-04-25 18:53:54 I'd rather have a sufficient solution with  a plan for regular preventative maintenance than an ideal solution with no plan for maintenance.

Put another way: a fancy sports car would be fun, but if it leaves no budget for oil, brakes, tires, I'd go for the boring sedan any day.
2256 2018-04-25 18:53:48 Nigeria’s primary economic weakness is vulnerability to oil price shocks, something we experienced most recently in 2014, but the government is yet to implement the reforms needed to remove this vulnerability.

2257 2018-04-25 18:53:46 I have combo skin, and I’ve only been using oils in my skincare for 2 weeks now but I already see a difference- my t-zone is less oily. The science behind it is the more that you use oil on your body, the less the body needs to produce oil.
2258 2018-04-25 18:53:46 Finally joining the bull camp in oil, you convinced me...

2260 2018-04-25 18:53:33 Funny I read plenty in the same publication about money and investment leaving Canada, esp in the oil sector-wait for the carbon tax! Anyhoo identity politics, province vs province, broken border and rising debt for little gain. Trump tax cuts make Canada even less appealing now.

2265 2018-04-25 18:53:21 He never understood science and couldn’t reason against it.  So, getting rid of it is only natural to accommodate his goal of dismantling the EPA for big oil.  Now, I have to get back to all the stories about how talented the First Lady is at hosting a state dinner.
2266 2018-04-25 18:53:19 Brent and Crude oil show little action, gaining ~0.04% and ~0.28% respectively
2267 2018-04-25 18:53:17 Tea tree oil from the body shop actually saved my life!!! I had a ton of really dark acne scars (even if I didn’t pick) and after two weeks of applying the oil my skin became significantly clearer!! It also helped prevent breakouts
2268 2018-04-25 18:53:07 International Arbitration Tribunal Rules ConocoPhillips is Owed $2.04 Billion in its Dispute with PDVSA
Ruling is in response to expropriation of ConocoPhillips’s investments in the Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy crude oil projects in Venezuela in 2007.
2269 2018-04-25 18:53:06 This would be the same @SKGov that is praying for a significant rebound in the price of oil, I imagine.  $67.90 today and +$75.00 would be welcome with our budget woes. No doubt that hit on pocketbooks will be countered by enthusiastic promises of general prosperity. 
2270 2018-04-25 18:52:49 Sorry to rain on the parade, but the 2.331Mbpd in US crude oil exports is a non-topic. Next week it’ll most likely be 1.1-1.2. It’s all about the 4 week averages, and it’s not there. Trackers can take a week off because facts won’t matter. #OOTT
2271 2018-04-25 18:52:48 PSA: Please don’t use essential oil diffusers in a household with pets. Cats lack enzymes that allow them to break down and remove the toxins from their body, and pets enhanced sense of smell can cause irritation from the oils!

2274 2018-04-25 18:52:37 If you really feel that the US is trying to start a war with Iran because it hurt it's people you don't like truth. Seriously, it's oil and the dollar. #WakeUp

2281 2018-04-25 18:51:02 country. Oil does not belong to them. It belonged to people of Iraq.Saudis who hired US as mercenaries were paid by them in full. American does nothing for free & does only for herself. That is why they have on dollar bill " We Trust In God " but everyone else pays cash.

2353 2018-04-25 18:42:22 Thought the President was bringing in MORE jobs, not eliminating them, e.g. White House agencies (which are understaffed already), steel industry, and oil????? More swamp hired though, like Bolton, Pruitt!!

2356 2018-04-25 18:42:05 it was an accident, and one that I'm not likely to repeat in the future. I sprayed different perfumes on each wrist and then rubbed them together out of habit. Luckily it mostly came off with some face oil and Dr Bronners soap.

2378 2018-04-25 18:39:16 I don't normally roast carrots, but I did today and they were a hit. I baked them in olive oil, fresh thyme, salt, and pepper. I then glazed half with an Apricot mustard glaze. I used the same glaze on the spicy mango rubbed chicken legs.
2379 2018-04-25 18:39:15 Fry garlic & chilli in a decent amount of olive oil and then add cooked spaghetti and some salt and mix it all together, delicious. Dunno what it's called but I had it in Italy lol

2385 2018-04-25 18:38:25 This is new technology for BART. The extension marks the first time we're using Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) trains. They're environmentally-friendly and use renewable diesel from hydrogenated vegetable oil.

2389 2018-04-25 18:37:41 Can somebody dump a few barrels of oil on Scott Pruitt’s front lawn? Maybe that would get the point across.
2390 2018-04-25 18:37:38 B.S.  big oil and big manufacturers rule how the vehicle standards are set... and the only thing that is benefited is the big wallets!
2391 2018-04-25 18:37:30 The only wealth in Iraq had was oil, and if we had taken it. We wouldn't have spend trillions of dollars being there.    I agree with Trump, we should have took the oil.

2401 2018-04-25 18:35:57 If turukana wants ten percent of their oil. Then all counties will be demand for 10% of all the offer. Water , electricity etc. They have an equalization fund which is almost as much as other counties cash.

Plastic is super cheap because oil prices are artificially low. It enables companies to export over large distances all year round (= greater profits). Meanwhile we’re losing any connection with local, seasonal food.

2484 2018-04-25 18:25:28 Baking soda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Y castor oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2488 2018-04-25 18:24:50 Best food tip ever. If you like oil and vinegar dressing but hate the shaking needed due to "oil and vinegar don't mix". Or your homemade dressing solidifies. ADD 1/2 tsp Mustard. The dressing will no longer solidify,& will stay mixed or after long periods will need only 1 shake.
2489 2018-04-25 18:24:42 Noooo way! Its far better to sell our souls and our resources to the American capitlist free market system!
 
Look at Norway, those stupid Scandis are in debt 1 trillion dollars from nationalizing their oil resources. 

Or wait.... 


2490 2018-04-25 18:24:28 Keep forgetting I gotta go get this oil changed let me get up
2491 2018-04-25 18:24:27 Hard to watch, but those are they types of women taking over the hive, and they are everywhere. But I don't think her daughter makes that call ever again, so there's that.
2492 2018-04-25 18:24:23 Then the oil money turned up! Carly did provide evidence he was once a MUFC fan!
2493 2018-04-25 18:24:19 Have you ever heard of a thing calked climate change? And that in order to reduce C emissions we cannot afford to use more than around 20% of the currently known oil, gas and coal reserves?
2494 2018-04-25 18:24:18 The oil rumble...? Sounds like you’ve been on those websites you’ve been told to stay off again!
2495 2018-04-25 18:24:18 I really want the lotion but its 60$ and i feel like thats too much. Cuz for the serum (40), the oil (16), and the lotion (60) thats 116, but i also want the pretty mask for 60, and the eye cream could be a nice addition for when im sleep deprived (32) so rlly I'm just conflicted
2496 2018-04-25 18:24:08 やっぱ松屋だな！！
2497 2018-04-25 18:23:59 As the other guy replied. I recommend cbd oil. Even if you dont try it look into it for sure. Do you take a prescription for your bipolar? Both my sisters and mom have it and take meds for it and they all do very well now.
2498 2018-04-25 18:23:58 And now the Nelson guy ex president of Venezuela Nations bank was schedule to be kidnapped elections day , they cleaned out Venezuela otherwise explain how a natural oil rich country is not eating

2503 2018-04-25 18:23:07 Thanks very much! The support was greatly appreciated. Currently sipping a well deserved @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil to congratulate myself 
2504 2018-04-25 18:23:06 Just a reminder to college students everywhere who feel stupid during exam week. No matter how dumb you feel you’ll never be as bad as me for using olive oil instead of milk for Mac and cheese. Still unsure how any university accepted me 
2505 2018-04-25 18:23:06 Yes!!  I completely agree! Going Hybrid to Electric would help a lot as well. More car companies need to make the switch and we need to move away from oil.
2506 2018-04-25 18:23:00 AB and Canada needs to stop coddling oil corporations.
2507 2018-04-25 18:22:56 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
2508 2018-04-25 18:22:46 This girl really hates my guts, it’s ok boo just keep applying coconut oil it’ll all work itself out 
2509 2018-04-25 18:22:44 @Alfiesarmy16 Hoping you see this! Little girl here in USA had like symptoms. Parents went through horrible struggles in finding a cure. Their research led to Charlottes Web, CBD oil extracted from same named marijuana plant. Idk the laws there?
2510 2018-04-25 18:22:40 What is your favorite essential oil? What do you use it for?
2511 2018-04-25 18:22:35 Have this nutmeg oil that goes all over ur boys face ‘n beard, then I’ll brush that theroly “th Rollie” through,  ‘n Ooohh myyy!! Feels great, energizes yah ‘n moves lymph ‘n gives a very over all warm but cools spicy pleasant kinda feel
2512 2018-04-25 18:22:34 I am infamous for my massages. I use extra virgin olive oil and some secret spices. #HannibalLectersDatingProfile
2513 2018-04-25 18:22:30 omggggg jojoba oil to tan how have I never thought of this
2514 2018-04-25 18:22:30 i think i’m about to get a high mileage oil change on friday for way under $40! i’m super stoked ;3;
2515 2018-04-25 18:22:22 I remember hearing you mention krill oil on a podcast. Do you take it regularly, and do you have a recommended brand? I'm currently taking the krill oil by NOW Sports. Thank you!
2516 2018-04-25 18:22:17 @tarabusicreek is there a way for you guys to make soaps without palm oil? Palm oil is made by the deforestation of an endangered species of monkey, the orangutan. Thousands have died for palm oil to be made. Otherwise I love your products !
2517 2018-04-25 18:22:16 That motherfucking oil
2518 2018-04-25 18:22:01 Democratic government. You are more dilusional then I thought. The cANCer can no longer sel there snake oil. Do they pay you for your work.
2519 2018-04-25 18:21:55 All 2 strokes. No oil leaks 
2520 2018-04-25 18:21:53 I gotta go get an oil change. Like right now.
2521 2018-04-25 18:21:33 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
2522 2018-04-25 18:21:25 skrillex and rose hip oil is all we need
2523 2018-04-25 18:21:21 Pretty shocking actually
The US has long considered Canada's fossil fuel reserves as part of their own "strategic reserves".
So there ain't going to be no pipelines built, other than ones that carry oil to the USA.
Our best option was energy independence.
But we blew that.
2524 2018-04-25 18:21:13 One bottle of fish oil and miltivitamins later and im 3 months depression free. Fuckin suck it
2525 2018-04-25 18:20:50 Swear I only run out of shampoo/conditioner, dog food, toilet paper, get a parking ticket and need an oil change all at the same time when I’m running low on funds... NEVER when I have a sufficient looking bank account 
2526 2018-04-25 18:20:39 I ask you why, because over half were employed in oil sands prior to NDP take over and didn’t save for rainy day when shit hit the skidders! Everyone I saw except 16 y/o’s had a 60k dollar pickup truck at 899/mth over 96!  And a inflated house price bc refugee resettlement in YMM
2527 2018-04-25 18:20:33 Oil and gas is a sunset industry- time to invest in renewable energy.
2528 2018-04-25 18:20:33 You just got finished working on your car. You're covered in oil and dirt. Do you
2529 2018-04-25 18:20:30 What an idiotic statement! Last I checked oil and gas is still increasing in usage worldwide and is expected to grow until the 2040's

#CluelessLiberal
2530 2018-04-25 18:20:11 I repeat ! Canada has a small market comparable speaking with other countries. It would take between $10-$15 billions to build a refinery and this is not counting on the amount of $ it would take to run it once built. Other countries won't come here to refine their oil !
2531 2018-04-25 18:20:06 Wow I'm in sephora wahlin. I did not know j'adore perfume came in a dry oil. Its lit now
2532 2018-04-25 18:19:58  Coconut oil and acting a fool works wonders
2533 2018-04-25 18:19:44 Can't wait to receive my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ
2534 2018-04-25 18:19:33 LOL!! Yes Senator, do a hostile takeover of all the oil companies. Having government run them will certainly reduce the price........not!
2535 2018-04-25 18:19:28 They also appear to be massively short oil companies and/or oil service companies.
2536 2018-04-25 18:19:28 Haven’t been this excited about a hot oil treatment in quite some time.
2537 2018-04-25 18:19:24 Dump oil on her booty, give her backshots, then call it a day.

2541 2018-04-25 18:18:56 Hot bath and baby oil, & a microfibre cloth. Rub, rinse, repeat and a good scrub with a towel when you get dry. The oil helps remove as does the heat& friction. Also, shaving waxing helps remove it on areas like the legs...

2546 2018-04-25 18:18:35 Start with the turkey. Brown it and mince it. Then add the rice. Carrots and pees right after. Take a few fish oil tablets (the dissolved ones), and add after it’s all cooked and mix it in.
1 lb turkey, 2 cups rice, 1 cup peas and 1 cup carrots (chopped). 20-25 minutes simmer.
2547 2018-04-25 18:17:40 lmfaooooo wow baldy I been told you grab son Jamaican castor oil
2548 2018-04-25 18:17:38 Maybe people shouldn’t rely entirely on the Oil industry and the government to help them? So many in Alberta lived well above their means in the boom years. Multiple houses and cars. And now they can’t afford it all.
2549 2018-04-25 18:17:36 So id LIKE to get the face steam, serum and oil for 80
2550 2018-04-25 18:17:31 I think you're great, Julie, but I recommend carrying butter or mineral oil in case that head gets so big you can't traverse normal doorways. ;)
2551 2018-04-25 18:17:30 Only 93% negative would be generous because Trump is 100% jacked-up. If you trust Hannity not not spin issues then god help you. Stop buying snake oil from the GOP.
2552 2018-04-25 18:17:08 So I’m currently chilling while my car gets an oil change and this guy waiting as well started talking on the phone in Arabic and he was Moroccan, lmaooo he has no idea that I now know his life story
2553 2018-04-25 18:17:04 Every single time I’ve gone to get my oil changed I’ve been the only woman there the entire time I was waiting 
2554 2018-04-25 18:17:02 Wow.  This is a good thing.  I think you’re up to 6 of those now that didn’t have anything to do with mining, oil , coal or hunting.  Wow... I should buy a lottery ticket today also.  Thank iunfor doing something decent for all.
2555 2018-04-25 18:17:01 #i #need #more Jamaican black castor oil
2556 2018-04-25 18:17:01 So oil and moisturize. But wouldnt you look greasy though? What if you already have oily skin?
2557 2018-04-25 18:16:47 my acne scars are fading and my skin is glowing!!! chemical exfoliants and rosehip oil bitch!!!
2558 2018-04-25 18:16:37 The Koch’s made their money selling oil to Stalin and the Nazis
2559 2018-04-25 18:16:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2560 2018-04-25 18:16:28 Except this is entirely on the Conservatives and the PCs. Oh and the morons who lived above their means. The Cons didn’t care about diversification. They put all their chips on oil and lost.
2561 2018-04-25 18:16:24 What about essential oil or no scent at all?
2562 2018-04-25 18:16:17 Come to get a oil change @jiffylube and they lock my keys in my car. Who the fuck is that stupid!? Now I have to sit here and wait for someone to unlock my doors!
2563 2018-04-25 18:16:16 That, perhaps, wouldn't be the case had Albertans and conservative parties not rejected the National Energy Program. If the oil and gas industry is going to be run by the private sector, which western Canada wanted, expect the worse and don't complain when it happens.
2564 2018-04-25 18:16:08 Yup.
He is a drifter and a conman, and an obvious one.

But a lot of people who buy snake oil, kind of know they’re getting conned and roll the dice anyway.

WHY? What need does he fill??
2565 2018-04-25 18:16:02 Aim on point with his scope and his been, spray it at your head like oil sheen.
2566 2018-04-25 18:15:58 Oil cleanser and serum: 52
With the extra eye cream: 84
With the face steam: 106
With the lotion: 166
With the mask and face steam: 200 something. Can't do that math in my head.
2567 2018-04-25 18:15:57 H&H fixed two broken valves, gave me an oil change and replaced my headlights for like $70. Didn't charge me for the headlights installation. If you're in winston, GO.
2568 2018-04-25 18:15:54 She has my heart, ever since I heard coconut oil and learned she was the one playing the flute at the beginning  I wish I could have been there!
2569 2018-04-25 18:15:53 I could easily smoke once a month and just fuck wit the oil full time.shit changed my life

2571 2018-04-25 18:15:48 OKAY I am going to make some bread and then dip it in oil and vinegar and call that dinner.

Not sure my brain can cope with anything more complex than that.
2572 2018-04-25 18:15:32 .@BrianJeanAB, you have spent the past decade being a partisan and a hypocrite. You compare our industry as economic saviour while destroying public services . You use your platform to spread the best lies about our oil & gas sector. Can we call you an out of touch person?

2596 2018-04-25 18:11:20 No. taxes incl. sales tax  & part of the withholding tax go to Sindh revenue board. Energy is cheaper than most of the exiting fuel oil plants. Plz name a few that r cheaper in Karachi if u can. As I said, part of the power is consumed via NKI locally.

2606 2018-04-25 18:10:36 I suspect this is payback for pushback on KM. Its all smoke and mirrors. Whether oil is 30 per barrel or 130, price always goes up. Never fluctuates in concordance with barrel price.

2624 2018-04-25 18:08:50 did you listen to the call JC had with venuzwala in 2014. praising what the goverment had done, in terms of reposesing private compaines so when oil dropped there was no value in production. hence why ppl were breaking into zoos to eat. that's the socialism JC will bring.
2625 2018-04-25 18:08:46 Is it true oil is constantly replenishing ?

2631 2018-04-25 18:08:00 $EPE are in Oil &Gas industry about $500 m cap, priced at  +- $2 per share. So it has consistent positive cash flow $77 mln q4’2018 and quite positive prior quarters, but it has loss making p/l account, hence it means that it has quite huge loss making non cash expenses.

2636 2018-04-25 18:07:42 No, Charles Koch says that the only thing Government should be doing is protecting property rights. Koch hates the Environmental Protection Agency because they fine him when he pollutes the water or causes oil spills. This guy is dangerous he could destroy the planet.

2648 2018-04-25 18:05:23 Macron is absolutely right about the environment. Trump and Pruitt are absolutely wrong. Why does a smart country like America let Trump drive us down the wrong road? There needs to be an environmental uprising to oppose this oil driven mentality. Now!

2650 2018-04-25 18:05:18 I actually bought it after watching his Top Picks a few weeks ago. Then going back and watching a bunch of other opinions on $BXE. It's not moving as much as some of the other more oil heavy stocks I own ( $BTE, $CR, $ATH) but I'm green on it, and I'm holding. #naturalgas
2651 2018-04-25 18:05:18 I'm not RT'ing, but I've just seen someone try to argue that all the docs in the Alfie Evans case are wrong (even those engaged by the father) and that all Alfie needs is some Hemp Oil. Apparently this will clear him right up. Sadly this is not the most stupid tweet of the day.

2658 2018-04-25 18:04:04 And that’s fine. Our bread didn’t come with anything and when we asked for balsamic and olive oil they said, “Sure. That will be £3.20 extra though”.  I thought it was excessive.
2659 2018-04-25 18:03:58 I made an omelette but it looked and tasted weird. I think I used way too much pepper/olive oil. Still, it was probably kinda healthy.
2660 2018-04-25 18:03:55 Feeling so sick today...probably that new MCT oil I was excited to try. Wow, thanks body for doing this to me when I was just trying to help you.

2672 2018-04-25 18:01:31 The only way to trade oil is via an Algo it's PA is crap.
2673 2018-04-25 18:01:12 The pipeline to Westridge has always been there, albeit not the capacity to transform Vancouver into a major oil tanker port which is what’s proposed. What few shipments to Asia have been done haven’t amounted to anything profitable nor will it ever with the costs.
2674 2018-04-25 18:00:46 That’s mainly CBD oil, which is derived from Hemp, a family of cannabis that doesn’t produce more than 0.3% THC. 

Marijuana, on the other hand, produces significant amount of THC & much less CBD.

2678 2018-04-25 18:00:32 is great. But on a bed of lettuce, you don't have a salad but grilled asparagus. And not with white glop either.

Need some red onion, maybe a little goat's cheese and oil/vinegar dressing. Grilled tomato would go well too.

2691 2018-04-25 17:59:15 Exactly: The big problem we face is the lack of choices which support a low cost neg health impact diet. Current diets high in cheap carbs, oil, sugar, subsidised via #BigAg, chems & high impact farming. 
Veg, fruit, herbs, coloured veg (high in caratinoids, flavinoids , etc.)???

2757 2018-04-25 17:50:43 Hi me again! I try to use most of these daily cause of Chronic Fatigue but during exams I always used Oil of Oregano, Ginseng capsules and Echinacea to try give me that energy that I couldn’t get from caffeine and if I really needed caffeine I would drink a green tea! 
2758 2018-04-25 17:50:10 #Data in all forms is the new OIL in this generation #WillisDaily
2759 2018-04-25 17:50:07 I wonder if they will make a return or have now been paid off with the rise in oil.
2760 2018-04-25 17:50:05 Scheduled a boat load of appointments for my time off. Including an oil change (ON MY CAR) that I’ve been putting off for... cough cough... 6 months.

2778 2018-04-25 17:48:33 The requirements for our last presentation was that it had to involve a science concept and that you had to teach it

so this guy literally talked about how to change the oil in your car.....

I GUESS
2779 2018-04-25 17:48:31 And guess whose oil will benefit? Hint: Starts with R 

“Reinstating sanctions on May 12 would inhibit Tehran's ability to export oil by threatening so-called secondary sanctions on countries that engage in transactions with Iran's Central Bank.” US News
2780 2018-04-25 17:48:29 I spotted Kim K has brought out a yet another boring new perfume. I've been planning a series of unisex scents for the Workshopshed: 
Spring: 2 stroke oil and freshly cut grass
Summer: Petrol and burnt steak
Autumn: Paraffin and damp leaves
Winter: White spirit and pine needle
2781 2018-04-25 17:48:23 Iran sold oil, they didn't need 400million our tax dollars,
wasted our oil dollars 40 years,
Should have paid for Afghanistan, let afghanis hit up the right FLANK, or that

2783 2018-04-25 17:48:10 3/ So @anasalhajji (an "independent analyst" that doesn't like it when others point out how WRONG he was on his US oil production analysis) is also John Kemp's colleague? #OOTT
2784 2018-04-25 17:48:05 Truck has spilt oil on the Wadia college bridge. Two wheelers have slipped & people have fallen.

2786 2018-04-25 17:47:57 Basra produces over 80% of Iraq’s oil, but citizens have nothing to show for it. It has the worst infrastructure, undrinkable water, and neglected roads. Jobs are scarce, as are school supplies and medical equipment. This is the product of the after invasion foreign investment...
2787 2018-04-25 17:47:56 The mortification when you order from the super lite menu in Ramen with prawn crackers and the guy serving you says they are cooked in oil just in case you’re trying to be healthy @SusieSalome 
2788 2018-04-25 17:47:51 Try Rosemary, argan or moringa oil.. argan oil especially... super light weight
2789 2018-04-25 17:47:36 The oil stops to flow when there’s no vessel. Create a system to support your enterprise.

2790 2018-04-25 17:47:31 ..in the planet Oil, you can't prevent short sighted investors from only thinking about their immediate profit.
2791 2018-04-25 17:47:28 Ladies when exfoliating, don’t leave out the . It safely removes all the dead skin, prevents ingrown hair bumps and keeps it soft. Sugar and virgin olive oil is how I make my scrub. You’re welcome .
2792 2018-04-25 17:47:14 Ha ha, I think I have won my place in the village now - I’m judge and not judged!
I use orange oil made by Boyajian - I have to buy it online in uk. I guess you live in India so if you can’t find it there then just use lots of orange zest.
2793 2018-04-25 17:47:09 Scientists that are funded by Soros, Sierra Club etc. I'm not stupid, all you have to do is follow the money. They say what ever they greenies want to hear. What benefits, higher costs for everything? Let me know when you give up all oil based products in your life. #hypocrite
2794 2018-04-25 17:47:06 I seriously hate getting my oil changed. They always come back with some issue with the danng car
2795 2018-04-25 17:47:00 You’re literally not gonna believe me when I say this but I stopped doing the most. I used to kill my face w exfoliators, masks & alladat but now I wash my face with an oil free cleanser day & night and I apply Vaseline all over my face overnight so my skin is smooth/mark free
2796 2018-04-25 17:46:59 That too....   Never mind $70 oil that should help as well.
2797 2018-04-25 17:46:55 Yes - we have quite a lot of evidence that the information getting to Trudeau came from Harper appointees. So I do have sympathy for him. I think he has been fed the wrong information. And the lobbying from big oil has been intense.
2798 2018-04-25 17:46:48 Analyzing samples of corn oil after lunch. I'm hungry. Must be the Midwestern in me.
2799 2018-04-25 17:46:41 Answer 1 question: how many solar panels would it take to get Canada off of oil and gas and how much surface area will it need?
2800 2018-04-25 17:46:38 Regular has coconut oil anddd dairy & the dairy-free one has coconut oil
2801 2018-04-25 17:46:36 Looks like it would have been a good choice to go with the oil.
2802 2018-04-25 17:46:17 Are your foreign & Canadian oil/natural gas companies exporting Canada’s energy future—as is happening in the USA, so we must import 7.5 M barrels of higher-priced foreign oil daily?

USA will be dependent on the Middle East for oil again—as well as on China. #dumb #corruption
2803 2018-04-25 17:46:09 “Command the Israelites to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually.  Leviticus 24:2
2804 2018-04-25 17:46:02 I use it on my skin. But it's way too heavy on my face. I'll spend the whole day sweating and wiping oil off my face
2805 2018-04-25 17:46:01 It looks like one of the Market Makers hit the take out all stops button in oil, long &short.
2806 2018-04-25 17:45:59 Booo! That does not help us with campaign contributions from big oil. Who is going to bribe us to look out for children?
2807 2018-04-25 17:45:56 Nice fantasies, but US has already said to sanction any country that helps Syria to re-build. The UN has till now supported only the Aggressors (USA) side, and they support the US stealing the oil and gas from Syria, transported it to Iraq.Try honesty first.
2808 2018-04-25 17:45:54 GC Baseball @ Oil City today has been postponed and rescheduled for tomorrow.

GC Softball @ Slippery Rock today has been postponed and rescheduled for Friday.
2809 2018-04-25 17:45:52 I am sick of the oil speculation pushing prices sky-high.
2810 2018-04-25 17:45:49 You Can't imagine what's venezuelan life. For example 1$ is 800bs TODAY! The salary(monthly) is 1.200bs. These are 3cokes (2lts each) or 2 oil lt. Or 1kg of cheese. 4kg. Of dogs food. Venezuela is almost Haiti today :(
2811 2018-04-25 17:45:47 When we are obedient, God can reveal the very things we desire in our lives.. When we are out of alignment it cannot be revealed because the flesh cannot comprehend the words of the Spirit.. The flesh and The Spirit speak and move differently. It's oil and water...
2812 2018-04-25 17:45:44 1/ Mr Kemp also referred to those people as his colleagues. So @Samir_Madani (someone who maintains an oil data site while not wanting to disclose how he makes money since he is working on it full time) is his colleague?
2813 2018-04-25 17:45:33 Check your Engine oil today.

studied for an exam

and it’s only 11:45, i killin it today i won’t lie.
2818 2018-04-25 17:44:55 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
2819 2018-04-25 17:44:51 It’s not helped that:
- refineries had been changing over from winter to summer blends
- there’s few refineries over on the west coast
- those refineries don’t just serve BC, but WA and OR too
- and the Cdn$ isn’t as tied to oil anymore, and is weak-ish against the US$
2820 2018-04-25 17:44:50 If you think you’re having a bad day just remember, I broke a glass unused bottle of cooking oil all over my kitchen floor

2824 2018-04-25 17:44:20 Take the land, take the oil.
2825 2018-04-25 17:44:11 They have. The last I heard was specific threat to a new FPSO which is due later this year. Also a couple of their leaders were captured after trying to kidnap some oil workers.

2830 2018-04-25 17:43:19 Inflation was brought down by massive unemployment and an end to oil shocks. All we learned from Volcker was that Monetarism was bunk.

2836 2018-04-25 17:42:39 Fascinating chart: majority of asset managers think peak oil demand (actual or forecast) a risk within the next five years if I read this correctly.

2841 2018-04-25 17:41:39 i started mixing tea tree oil with my face moisturizer 2 weeks ago and my skin is so... so smooth
2842 2018-04-25 17:41:36 Actually - with shale and renewables picking up, higher oil isn’t sustainable for Long.
2843 2018-04-25 17:41:36 That is not just water. It was flowing out of that container. No flash floods. Their was oil and it was stinking. We saw it flowing onto the railway tracks. Do not try to cover this up. It was not just me that was there, lots of people from the marathon was there and concerned!
2844 2018-04-25 17:41:33 Yep. I tried coconut oil and my face ended up like ibadan road, but shea butter works well for me
2845 2018-04-25 17:41:32 Matt posts,
Hello lovelies 
 Does anyone have any experience with CBD oil. I have very limited knowledge of it but I’m wanting to get off Lyrica as it’s not really helping with my intense pain and insomnia etc etc. thanks in advance
2846 2018-04-25 17:41:27 I tjink it is for imitation butter, oil.
2847 2018-04-25 17:41:22 My morning drink is Bulletproof coffee, 1 or 2 tablespoons of organic grass fed butter, 1 tablespoon of MCT oil, one scoop of Dr. Axe collagen, and 1 scoop of Cacao. After coffee is made I throw it all into my Vitamix, and out comes a frothy creamy coffee! Two net carbs!

2869 2018-04-25 17:38:39 Adding to my rant from the other day, I’ve been highly skeptical of “reformed” product companies. From t-shirts to coffee, beard oil to coffee mugs (of which I own a few). But it feels no different than a Family Christian Store. Which is what the YR&R crowd disliked, I thought.

2875 2018-04-25 17:38:00 Oil pullings attracts the lipid layer of bacterial cell membranes, and it sticks & pulled to the oil. The oil gets emulsified & surface area of the oil gets increased….This oil will coat the teeth and gingivitis inhibits bacterial co-aggregration and plaque formation .

2887 2018-04-25 17:36:38 The new short Vix one-sided trade is long oil. All the cool hedge funds are doing it. 

I wonder how long it will take that trade to break. Please I hope it breaks tomorrow.... I need to buy gas.
2888 2018-04-25 17:36:32 I just use cold pressed jojoba oil, you can get it p cheap on amazon
2889 2018-04-25 17:36:23 You could buy your own oil and take it to them to change it for you. They charge like $10-$15

2891 2018-04-25 17:35:41 Reducing dependence on oil imports will not help. As Chomsky notes, it’s control of oil, not oil supply for domestic consumption, that is the key driver of geopolitical machinations. Cf. Russia’s use of oil as a strategic weapon.
2892 2018-04-25 17:35:40 How many oil rigs a drilling in the ocean today? How many oil rigs have had spills? how many years have humans been drilling in the ocean? Your making it sound like the minute they drill there is going to be an oil spill.
2893 2018-04-25 17:35:39 and because of that they killed all those trees and of course they also killed lots of animals because they lose their natural habitat don t you feel bad when you eat vegetable butter with palm oil?

Less educated and impoverished people/communities rely on jobs like that to survive. And you demonize then like a 2nd class citizen
2915 2018-04-25 17:32:14 Oil at these levels is a negative for global growth. Supply is still plentiful. It should come down but may take a while......
2916 2018-04-25 17:32:07 @JKempEnergy when there are claims from Libya of pipeline blasts, do you and your colleagues pressure them for any evidence? Or you just report what a Libyan company puts out there? You know those companies have an interest in keep oil high, or at least preventing a fall. #OOTT

2942 2018-04-25 17:29:24 Won't work.  If the tide could be turned, we'd still be using whale oil and gaslight and steam power. If Hydro won't buy power, community groups will get together to make systems and share in smaller pods.  People act in their own best interests, not interests of grid.
2943 2018-04-25 17:29:13 @PointlessBlog  BABY OIL GETS RID OF TEMPORARY TATTOOS
2944 2018-04-25 17:29:07 It's not due to oil being $69/barrel. It's due to Alberta's greed first and foremost. Their bitumen costs a lot more to refine and they're demanding a high price for it. We'd be better off getting our crude from North Dakota or California instead, like Washington and Oregon do.
2945 2018-04-25 17:29:06 Clinique Moisture Surge! Super lightweight. No oil. Or Farsali’s rose gold elixir. That’s oil based though :)

There is no call for 1.40/l gas when oil has been steady for years below 80/barrel.

Get off your ass and DO SOMETHING!!
2958 2018-04-25 17:28:00 Trump and #macron take the oil great together.
2959 2018-04-25 17:27:53 Dwayne was a great asset during our oil to gas conversion - knowledgeable and friendly!
2960 2018-04-25 17:27:47 you are that. Albertans don't deserve this pipeline crap. whether we like it or not, our lives and our economy still is oil and gas dependant. i'm all about managing risk. until we find a replacement, we need oil every day.
2961 2018-04-25 17:27:45 Wait... that's a Lt Governor's duty? I had no idea market manipulation of the oil industry was your job. Must fall somewhere between "certifying municipal annexations," and "maintaining oversight over all elections."

2967 2018-04-25 17:26:55 DWT manual exit 8.84 +1.1%. That's daily goal, but OIL is primed to go much much lower, so I'm hanging around to market close, looking to re-enter. Not a fan of CHOP today. Lot's of blood.
2968 2018-04-25 17:26:52 That’s incorrect. There’s cbd oil that can be “vaped” and does not have thc in it. It’s quite common.

2972 2018-04-25 17:26:35 How many lies are you going to tell? They voted in favour of it AND we already are oil and gas independent.

We export 5 times more than we import.
The only thing that would make us more independent would be to nationalise the industry.

Is that honestly what your are advocating?
2973 2018-04-25 17:26:28 Doubt it. US plan to control Russia is low oil prices. 
Lot's oil going to hit the market from the Permian basin in the next couple years and if you want to understand chaos in middle east Google Genie Oil...take a look at their strategic advisory board if you doubt it's find
2974 2018-04-25 17:26:25 You understand that oil prices are set based on world demand so unless you don’t want market economics this is what happens increased demand with stable supplies means increased prices.
2975 2018-04-25 17:26:18 @Kathleen_Wynne the price of oil has been steady in the high 60's. Recall prior to the Gulf war through to Obama's term gas per litre was close to par with the past ice of the barrel of oil. 

Meaning THERE IS NO DAMNED EXCUSE FOR THESE REDICULOUS PRICES!!
2976 2018-04-25 17:26:16 Uhh it’s foul for that man to hop up mid stroke. 
Coach me through it daddy. Let me know how you want me to toss this ass back. Oh, it’s not wet enough? Coo. I have some coconut oil right here. Wym? Either you fake it or fix it. 
2977 2018-04-25 17:25:43 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
2978 2018-04-25 17:25:36 愛 = "ai," which sounds like "I" and gets used in a ton of cross-language puns.

As someone else in the thread pointed out, 油 can be read as "yu." So, it's possibly a "I love you" / "love (cooking) oil" pun.
2979 2018-04-25 17:25:31 It will cost us our environment if we continue to do nothing but bow to the oil industry. They are responsible for millions of deaths a year due to air pollution.

2991 2018-04-25 17:24:02 Obama imposed crushing legislation on corporations, so they fled overseas. He stopped drilling for oil, which would've made us independent of other nations. He caused unemployment to stay at an all time low during his  8 yrs.

2993 2018-04-25 17:23:53 CBD is a compound/extract so yes. But CBD is either straight, hemp or thc based so it depends on which oil you choose
2994 2018-04-25 17:23:37 Tea tree for the win! It's anti-bacterial so it's great for acne/break outs. I mix a few drops in some coconut oil in my palm to dilute. Also try to get raw organic or extra virgin coconut oil so it isn't processed. More processed = more skin problems because it blocks your pores
2995 2018-04-25 17:23:31 Interestingly THAT seems 2B why Putin/Russia are in Syria...what? like they ONE CRAP abt the Syrian ppl? Syria leads to the Mediterranean...shipping route for their F'ing OIL. #SoThereYouHaveIt

3004 2018-04-25 17:21:20 So, gas is over $1.50/L, analysts are saying that's due to oil being $69/barrel...

When gas first broke $1.00, years ago, they said that was due to oil being $100/barrel.

This math doesn't add up.

@bcndp you guys need to figure this out, or increase EV rebates!
3005 2018-04-25 17:21:13 Improve the country HOW?
I mean if I was the owner of a coal or oil company I'd probably be pretty happy, I suppose..
3006 2018-04-25 17:21:11 i do both. it does dry your hair with the mask but it defines my curls so well i just make sure i put oil in it as well.

3017 2018-04-25 17:19:41 Trump has done more to keep Russia in line than previous administrations. He killed about 200 Russians in Syria no one talks about, he sent 60 diplomats home, he is producing our own oil which is killing Russia. No reset button or letting them annex countries under Trump
3018 2018-04-25 17:19:18 Lol. Oil listed as optional.
3019 2018-04-25 17:19:09 Sounds like a false flag? Chevron-world got so much oil now. No need for the Venezuelan one. US desire to destroy socialism only. Fake excuses...

3022 2018-04-25 17:18:35 I came for an oil change, how did they manage to charge me $140 ?!
3023 2018-04-25 17:18:33 Make no mistake conservatives are in a political civil war with liberals and it is a fight to the death. Oil and water don't mix but separate. Oil floats to the top because it is less dense and the liberals are as dense as they cone.
3024 2018-04-25 17:18:30 Brought Blains truck to get the oil changed for him. The guy comes out and says “Uh, Mrs Honaker”. So I just sat here...and he cleared his throat and said “You, Mrs Honaker?” Pointing to me and I was like oh fuck no pal, I’m just the cousin lol. Anxiety through the roof!!

3028 2018-04-25 17:17:37 At 1:15pm I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLM18) and USO on my software.
3029 2018-04-25 17:17:17 Look the beard well. Beard dey dry like leaf wey no see water drink.
Once i start chop money now, you go see say the beard go get oil..
3030 2018-04-25 17:17:16 -that's f-ing...for FRACKING....
old oil wells are frak'n good....& Syria has lot of'm!
3031 2018-04-25 17:17:08 Unfortunately, as we have seen with the #OKLeg, they don't care what their constituents think or want.  They are beholden to bribes from big oil, the NRA, and for some reason, the hotel industry
3032 2018-04-25 17:17:02 There’s an oil tanker ban (“Voluntary Exclusion Zone”) on the entire BC north coast. It preempted places like Stewart, or Prince Rupert. Everything north of 50° 53’ N (north of the northern tip of Vancouver Island) up to our half of the Portland Canal (Hyder).
3033 2018-04-25 17:16:48 I don't think I am going to be using my face oil before my makeup anymore! It's combining so WEIRD lately and so begins the search for a regular ole moisturizer again.
3034 2018-04-25 17:16:33 Everytime I come to get an oil change they wanna talk about other stuff like I don’t even understand what you’re saying so just do what I asked 
3035 2018-04-25 17:16:29 STV spinning the oil price as bad, because it might go down again. 

Arghhh, we feckin know that, the point is that when it’s high we should save to compensate for when it’s low, not piss it away on no use nukes or bombing innocents!
3036 2018-04-25 17:16:23 I'm old school, Piz Buin or chip oil.
3037 2018-04-25 17:16:22 An oil baron like yourself will give it all to charity 
3038 2018-04-25 17:16:21 Cajuput oil emang mahal anjir beli yg kecil aja 16k
3039 2018-04-25 17:16:08 Coconut oil?
3040 2018-04-25 17:16:05 Hasn't Golan Heights recently been discovered with pretty generous oil reserves that can rival Saudi Arabia? 
3041 2018-04-25 17:16:00 3rd, cooking & cleaning are daily chores. Add up all that time & it definitely won’t be even w/ mowing the lawn & changing the oil.
3042 2018-04-25 17:15:55 Ok no problem, subsidize renewables on the same scale Oil is and lets see who wins out. But that will never happen under @realDonaldTrump and #BootPruitt.
3043 2018-04-25 17:15:53 Just read, and admired, your review in the Standard. Didn't get on with Oil... so I'll have to try agai!
3044 2018-04-25 17:15:48 There's a ban on oil tankers on the coast, but I haven't looked at the details.  I don't know if it's just crude, in which case there would have to be some refining, I guess.  There was a gofundme kind of a petition to get ban reversed, but not much hope, imo.
3045 2018-04-25 17:15:46 Good idea.  The most realistic I have heard to date.  
Innovative, let's AB get on with their Oil business.
Saves precious BC environment & tourism business.  
Elizabeth, you are smarter by half than the rest, hands down
Thank you.

3052 2018-04-25 17:15:11 Absolutely disgusting propaganda. There would not be a war if it wasn't for the west (thus EU/NATO/USA and oil States like Saudi Arabia and Qatar).  @jimmy_dore
3053 2018-04-25 17:15:09 And why no carbon tax on imported oil? Are the conflict producers held to a lower standard!
3054 2018-04-25 17:14:57 That is lots of oil, I guess.

3060 2018-04-25 17:14:27 Good plan. I keep clothes next to the bed. I've seen fires in a pre-war building. Sarah had a neighbor who liked candles and massage oil. Dumbass left her door open when she ran. The fire torched the entire hallway. But the fire doors saved her apartment.
3061 2018-04-25 17:14:22 stuck waiting for this oil change. someone be my friend and scoop me

3072 2018-04-25 17:12:34 @ChristianForTX Paragraph 6: " there are advantages and disadvantages to using fossil fuels."  Yep.  However, the person in Texas in charge of regulating oil and gas in a state the produces as much petroleum as Texas might be a little biased. #climatechange

3078 2018-04-25 17:12:02 A major oil spill in Alaska's Beaufort Sea would occur 1,000+ miles from the nearest #CoastGuard station, with the threat of sea ice in all seasons, subzero temperatures, storms & darkness up to 20 hrs a day. This unique ecosystem is incompatible with expanded #offshoredrilling.

3087 2018-04-25 17:10:55  Best to have thorough Security Background Checks done before we plow thru resumes. No Russians, NRA, Man-Pigs, Mobsters, Oil People, Bigots, Money Launderers...pretty much like the GOP of the who's who...that's in office now.

3110 2018-04-25 17:08:24 This hot ass weather is making my face so dry! It’s time to break out the coconut oil.
3111 2018-04-25 17:08:15 Iran will just sell its oil to China.  That leaves the oil China would've bought on the market for other buyers.  How is this disruptive?
3112 2018-04-25 17:07:54 Even the UK based errconomic cum newpaper reviewer...lumped BUHARI as the cause of the recession....totally normal after all he made us majorly oil SALE dependent for FX likewise the price crash!

3119 2018-04-25 17:07:15 Shouldn't we just suspend legalization of MJ since there are now legal varieties of non-THC carrying hemp and oil that can be used medicinally? Plus there's so many dangers of mental illness and schizophrenia in young users as well as pot being a gateway drug for many.

3123 2018-04-25 17:06:47 OMG and that’s what you are referring to about intelligence? I work with some of the most educated doctors and scientist in the country and most of them don’t know how to check their oil. I’m talking about knowledge not IQ or some 2 bit high school GPA!
3124 2018-04-25 17:06:35 Took City ages to get it right after the oil money came in. It's a process.
3125 2018-04-25 17:06:11 Why is the only plausible justification for strength in oil the Saudis? Can’t it be demand or US infrastructure bottlenecks? Oil crashing to 26 broke the myth of peak oil, will it take oil to 100 to break the view that shale production can be turned on or off like a tap? #OOTT
3126 2018-04-25 17:06:00 made my own hair concoction featuring aloe, castor oil, and sweet almond oil. truly amazing.
3127 2018-04-25 17:05:50 do i have to clean and oil a gun if i haven't used it in almost forever? it's just when it gets dirty from bullets et tout?

3129 2018-04-25 17:05:45 I wish I could be like those people who just use coconut oil, leaves and berries for clear skin.

but I guess accutane is fine

3133 2018-04-25 17:05:36 THE CITY OF BOCA RATON HAD A CREW OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS THAT COMBED THE BEACH'S EARLY EVERY MORNING LOOKING FOR THE SEA TURTLE'S NESTS. THE SEA TURTLE'S ARE PROTECTED IN BOCA RATON FL. I STILL BELIEVE IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE OIL YOU SHOULD TRACK IT WITH THE SEA TURTLE'S!
3134 2018-04-25 17:05:31 Yet they go on about co2 emissions etc. and import oil from Nations (Arab) which have no regulation on the high emissions producing their dirty oil. But I guess Trudeau can`t tax them so he makes us pay for something we produce less of than most Countries in the world
3135 2018-04-25 17:05:27 Macron he's a former investment banker for one of the biggest bank he has the same integrity as any snake oil seller.
3136 2018-04-25 17:05:23 Yep. What happens when oil prices go back to $100 a barrel?
3137 2018-04-25 17:05:22 Bisa 1st stepnya itu pakai cleansing milk, oil or balm. Itu buat angkat makeup, sunblock gitu2 mir. Coba biore cleansing oil aja. Nah setelah itu baru ke "sabun" buat angkat sisanya. Dulu sblm double cleansing aku suka ada jerawat di dahi kayanya sisa makeup
3138 2018-04-25 17:05:00 Ridley disingenuously picks Nigeria because it is one of the very few exceptions. It’s the 6th biggest oil exporting country in the world. Not a typical sub-Saharan country. The only reason it’s not on 0% is because it has yet to sign an EU agreement to that effect.
3139 2018-04-25 17:04:51 @ChristianForTX Paragraph 4: "they [the mainstream media] make it seem like using oil and gas to drive our cars and heat our homes is bad."  Why don't you go suck on a car tailpipe, Wayne?  Seriously.  If you think the emissions aren't harmful, put your mouth where  your money is
3140 2018-04-25 17:04:49 It really is that good! It clings to you through sweat, face oil, and tears. Best eyeliner ever.  (I hope you aced that test!)

3155 2018-04-25 17:02:35 Oil absorption rules aren't becoming stronger, USBC is just not letting oil absorption rates increase like they have in the past. Your oil eating machine will still be allowed and any new balls in the future will be produced under today's oil absorption rules.

I always grew up not to venture out alone because the "bad men" would snatch you up, and I hear that's not a major concern in other cities. I think the temp oil jobs and freeways are a huge factor.

3239 2018-04-25 16:53:44 Is it that diet fads exist to make a super challenging process (filled with moments of wanting to hew your own arm off) seem somehow fun and easy? Isn't that the definition of snake oil?

3292 2018-04-25 16:48:26 Oil prices tumbled at European close on Wednesday, driven down by bearish weekly U.S inventories data. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) today, U.S crude stocks rose unexpectedly by 2.2 million barrels in the week to the 20th April.
3293 2018-04-25 16:48:17 I cancelled my sub at the globe because of your constant bearishness while oil was in the $40s and looks like you haven’t given up and are now quoting the most clueless sell side out there wow
3294 2018-04-25 16:48:13 Assad never ordered the PYD to control those oil fields , in fact there part of the US occupation of about 1/3 of Syrian territory

-Abuelita, ¿tus arrugas son de raíz?
-¿De raíz?
-Es que he visto en un anuncio que Oil of Olay te quita las arrugas de raíz.

3307 2018-04-25 16:47:09 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
3308 2018-04-25 16:46:54 Putting some @HTropic_CA dark tanning oil on to get my body “color ready” for summer. The best tanning oil ever! I can feel the sun frying my skin!

3311 2018-04-25 16:46:37 Art Laffer in particular has been selling snake oil for decades. Sadly, he continues to find buyers. He gets major credit for convincing state leaders to pursue a race to the bottom by cutting taxes (draining their states of revenue) w/the false promise they'll spur econ. growth.
3312 2018-04-25 16:46:29 Solar will come quick if the oil stops trying to stamp it out. Better still if it where to get help from the government as  unlikely as that is.
3313 2018-04-25 16:46:28 So I put a kind of oil in my hair that "supposedly" helps in growth and hydration
It is 100% natural

RESULT:
I'm itchy and I forgot that I have an allergy to most plants .... too late

3330 2018-04-25 16:43:46 I am so sorry that you fell into this trap. I am sure that you are a good person, but Big Oil and ICE Manufacturers are going to have a field day with this news. Environmentalists are already being called liars, alarmists and anti business. See “Dirty Money” on Netflix. Amazing.

3341 2018-04-25 16:42:20 It honestly depends on what type I'm cooking. White rice gets salt and olive oil. Yellow rice gets salt, olive oil, annato, paprika, boullion, sazon con azafran, and bijol.

so the other day, Taylor was massaging my hands and it just hit me:

3345 2018-04-25 16:41:32 Lol gosh, none of these do the trick for you? Well, sometimes I put some olive oil and ground black pepper on the veggies, that can help
3346 2018-04-25 16:40:59 I'm gonna buy my man some beard oil,  cause he too busy farming to buy it his darn self.
3347 2018-04-25 16:40:49 Public service announcement for polymer clay sculpting friends. For those who are unaware, using anything but a water based sealer will chemically react to oil based clays & destabilize them over time, ruining your sculpt! Always check for the words Water Based!
3348 2018-04-25 16:40:47 Shit, even my cover girl powder... I can use a range of powders in the oil control one (particularly in the summer), but matte?? Lmao, my face looked so dirty!
3349 2018-04-25 16:40:40 When you read "narrative olive oil" you're obviously in too deep.
3350 2018-04-25 16:40:35 Let's define "Welfare Recipients" and "Public Assistance". What about those getting farm subsidies for NOT growing things? How about the oil companies who get subsidies? Mmmmm.
3351 2018-04-25 16:40:35 Nigeria’s primary economic weakness is vulnerability to oil price shocks, something we experienced most recently in 2014, but the government is yet to implement the reforms needed to remove this vulnerability.

3360 2018-04-25 16:38:57 Using oil  for other products is not the problem..ending glass production of deposit return led to aluminum cans which needed handles. Paper bags were just fine until environmentalists threatened loggers by nailing trees which caused damage and injuries, Oil stepped in.

3362 2018-04-25 16:38:48 When I read your comment, I thought of the day Ronbo took office: the first thing he did was remove the solar panels Jimmy Carter had installed on the roof of the White House. Had Carter won and shifted us away from oil dependency what would the world be like today?

Also it causes traffick

3376 2018-04-25 16:36:18 It required start-up cash, and the oil and gas industry for decades had a choke hold on R&D, as well as the costs to produce outstripped demand. When costs came down, demand increased. Now that the industry is gaining ground, it can be self-sustaining,

3379 2018-04-25 16:36:08 Oh lord, no no no! 
Only use water based sealer on polymer clay! Because it's an oil based clay, oil based polyurethane, nail varnish, etc will actually chemically destabilize that clay over time & destroy it. Whenever using polymer clay make 100% sure sealer is water based

3384 2018-04-25 16:34:38 Senator, direct action won't move the oil companies. The only language they speak is economics. If we make it too unprofitable to drill in those pristine areas, oil companies won't go there. Only way to do that is to use more alternative fuels for transportation.

3426 2018-04-25 16:30:05 Looks like the USA wants total disorder in the middle east so all the oil will be Up for grabs, like Libya and lraq
3427 2018-04-25 16:29:57 Have you seen it if you leave it out? All the oil rises to the top. It looks gross

3430 2018-04-25 16:29:41 I am pasting your tweet here so @lisamurkowski can see: The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has now become the Arctic Oil and Gas Wildlife Killing Field.
3431 2018-04-25 16:29:39 The oil industry is disgusting. There is no end to where they won’t try to drill. They’re going for FL’s Everglades too
3432 2018-04-25 16:29:32 อิ_อิ
3433 2018-04-25 16:29:26 Ooooh, good to know. Does it come off well with soap, oil, or makeup remover?
3434 2018-04-25 16:29:13 I hate getting my oil change because I don’t know the etiquette

Am I supposed to wait until the door opens for me?
Am I supposed to tell you my miles?
Should I clean my car out first?
Do I wait for you to tell me everything? Or do I act like I know what’s going on?
So stressful
3435 2018-04-25 16:28:52 There is a very tiny part of my being that believes that olive oil has magical properties
3436 2018-04-25 16:28:47 I’m not getting how it’s ok to drill off of the coast of Nova Scotia and have Hibernia, but BC’s north coast gets a tanker ban, and no one is even talking about the huge oil find off of northern Vancouver island found in the 70’s.
3437 2018-04-25 16:28:37 @lisamurkowski you sold out the only planet we have, to stay in the good graces of oil and gas companies. SHAME ON YOU.

And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

3467 2018-04-25 16:25:07 11) This crisis did start with oil prices, but the extremity of it is because of 20 years of basic economic mismanagement by Chavez and Maduro.

We should remain deeply suspicious of anyone who championed them.

"It’s still not clear whether the refinery will have access to more oil from the Trans Mountain pipeline when it is expanded." But the company "is confident".  

Honestly hope they make it work, given the vagaries of the situation..

3521 2018-04-25 16:20:05 8) Of course it is and has been for decades. Venezuela has always thrived when oil prices were high and had recessions when they are low. But that fact does not explain the crisis Venezuela is in now.
3522 2018-04-25 16:19:50 If treasury yields back from current highs, Stock market could advance and sentiment turns bullish.,however yields continue to climb higher, stock market limited upside and further pull back likely.

Curious about oil-spill dispersants dampening oil-metabolizing microbiome activity: 
Is there a sense whether it's due to the dispersant itself or the act of oil dispersion? Were multiple kinds of dispersants tested, and do they all select for similar microbes?

3557 2018-04-25 16:16:28 Lava lamps contain two immicible substances (think oil and water), the oily one is a solid at room T but melts (becoming less dense than the aqueous solution) as the bulb warms it. Hence it floats to the top where it cools and falls back to the bottom.

3565 2018-04-25 16:15:33 Unfortunately they realise that and as a result they are looking for ways and investing to have clean and renewable energy so they can slowly get out of oil dependancy

Unfortunately, the oil does not prevent the pasta from sticking together. To prevent this effect, it should be stirred regularly.

3686 2018-04-25 16:02:39 Idea that flaxseed oil is good for seasoning is a nefarious one that has led to much frustration. All seeds (including flax) contain a mucilage layer and unless its completely refined out - and it almost never is - it will make your wok sticky. Also flakes like crazy.
3687 2018-04-25 16:02:38 It started in 2014 over oil subsidies and workers rights. Saudi Arabia formed its coalition in 2015 against the Houthis and it has spiraled from there into the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.

3691 2018-04-25 16:02:28 President Donald Trump criticism of OPEC should be answered respectfully by the Group.  They should point out that price increases of oil is due to market forces and is good for encouraging investment that eventually will bring more oil and lower prices.
3692 2018-04-25 16:02:19 Oil prices are expected to continue rising, therefore gasoline prices will continue rising, Canadian oil and gas exports continue falling as NO pipelines to coasts are built.  The foregone revenue equation here is staggering.  #TrudeauMustGo

3704 2018-04-25 16:01:41 Aren't you normally against firing people? Or are you just saying that if it happens to conservatives, it should also happen to liberals?

3707 2018-04-25 16:01:29 It's what keeps us going. Although to be honest, I'm not a REAL Albertan, because I came here to feast off the oil and gas dollars. And I never went back. So I should probably just shut the hell up. @decayinwtheboys on the other hand was born here - he can say whatever he likes.
3708 2018-04-25 16:01:27 Holy crap, he worked in oil and gas and doesn’t understand how countries actions impact each other ...
3709 2018-04-25 16:01:23 Investors will also look for clues on the Iran Deal.

"Trump held Macron's hand" Baruch continued. "That means the deal is as good as dead because holding hands with Trump always leads to the end of deals. Just ask Melania".

Options for $80 are high, making oil's future bright.
3710 2018-04-25 16:01:21 looks like you have water in your oil :) time to change it ..
3711 2018-04-25 16:01:17 I agree completely. Reduce plastic use. Paper better for environment.  Plastic packaging is an environmental killer. Plus the dependency on oil will reduce dramatically.
3712 2018-04-25 16:01:13 Number Nine: We will turn off the jobs, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

3718 2018-04-25 16:00:54 uwu i just applied tea tree oil and aloe vera on my face and im sipping on green tea
3719 2018-04-25 16:00:47 But Trump needs to pull out of the Iran deal to benefit Russia's oil production.
3720 2018-04-25 16:00:43 It’s their own damn fault.  If they’d have considered themselves energy companies instead of just oil, they could have led the charge (no pun) on battery tech research/manufacturing decades ago.
3721 2018-04-25 16:00:41 He said “I went ahead and drew up a reaaaaally good price for you! $887 including all taxes fees and service, out the door.” Who just has almost a grand to blow on tires when I came in for an oil change?
3722 2018-04-25 16:00:38 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
3723 2018-04-25 16:00:38 $1.30! I wish!! More like $1.57 reg gas in Vancouver n lower mainland. I am a cheerleader for "oil n gas" from Alberta and we need these pipelines built. What  not a fan of is  hypocrital stance  by #CatherineMcKenna n  lib gov allowing raw sewage dumping. Totally unacceptable!

3726 2018-04-25 16:00:31 It is important to remember that society is a process. There are no final solutions. 

At one point we needed oil and gas and plastic, just like we at one point needed horses. All things change, save death. Those who are unwilling to let go of the past become it.
3727 2018-04-25 16:00:30 Thts what I get for getting this full synthetic oil thinking its was better for my car and that shit was too heavy for my solenoids some shit like that
3728 2018-04-25 16:00:29 Try egg with a table spoon hair oil or coconut milk with hair oil.
3729 2018-04-25 16:00:24 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
3730 2018-04-25 16:00:16 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump how can these damn oil companies just raise the price of oil because they are in fear that somthing will happen? Total price gouging and ripping off as consumers.
3731 2018-04-25 16:00:14 U should try coconut oil, it really helped kona when he had issues
3732 2018-04-25 16:00:13 I had a 4cyl 80s Camaro that would run okay till you got on the throttle, then the oil light would come on and it would try to die. Turns out someone caught the oil light sensor wire under the valve cover and it was shorting on the rocker arms. Weird one, that.
3733 2018-04-25 16:00:11 I love making comments about Oil and the Pipeline and getting messages from my ticked off frineds in #Alberta.  Its great fun.
3734 2018-04-25 16:00:09 @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin 
On what factors does petrol and diesel price varies
Some says instead of cheap crude oil, petrol rates are higher
Some says that by increased rates current government is paying out last governments debt
Please provide proper document

3735 2018-04-25 16:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
3736 2018-04-25 16:00:08 Dxy. Only thing against our view is oil price. Need oil to to turn.
3737 2018-04-25 16:00:05 Venezuela that is ran by oil oligarchs? Yeah, not socialist is it?

Try Cuba though. Higher life expectancy and literacy rate than the US.

3739 2018-04-25 15:59:56 Speaking of which, first match Saudi and Russia betting could be a good hedge to current oil exposure .. 
3740 2018-04-25 15:59:56 Not just the oil majors, but permeates down to smaller businesses in AB......WHY would anyone invest in the AB economy until this has all been sorted out?  ....only significant investment is being done by GOVERNMENT, using debt funding.....so smart !!
3741 2018-04-25 15:59:49 WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! Hey @GasBuddyDan thirteen years ago oil was well over $100 a barrel yet gas was .65 a litre...what’s your reasoning for that?!?

3752 2018-04-25 15:58:59 Elementary my dear. Why don't the GOP get it? To help our children & grandchildren by protecting our environment today & doing all we can to prevent greater damage. Plus clean water & air are critical to all life, yet Pruitt has rolled back regs to protect us to favor oil & coal.
3753 2018-04-25 15:58:39 Robert Bosch announced that its engineers have developed a new diesel-exhaust system that cuts emissions far below legal limits taking effect in 2020 and can help automakers avoid potential driving bans in Europe #oil #Mobility

3755 2018-04-25 15:58:32 Best way to season wok is simply to cook in it and keep cooking in it. Strip and stir-fry a bunch of chives in peanut oil (or any oil not derived from seeds (i.e., canola, flax) as they can cause stickiness or with low burn point (i.e., olive) until black. Then cook/keep cooking.

3764 2018-04-25 15:57:51 Idk if this is done back at home too but they sell tuna cans with olive oil instead of tuna juice and it’s bomb in a salad bc you don’t even need dressing!!! And supposedly olive oil is healthy!
3765 2018-04-25 15:57:44 A well written piece which has been active within the Oil & Gas Industry for decades where young designers are mentored through FEED & DD with Design and Constructability Sessions for offsite modular and onsite Construction phases which brought numerous sustainability advantages

When an event happens in the Middle East oil doesn't surge like it use to. I'm conflicted by your Yemen..

3776 2018-04-25 15:56:43 Trump has lifted the ban on transport of Ivory into our Republic. He approved the dumping of coal waste into our waterways, lifted protections on endangered species. He had sold our public parks to oil companies.

3787 2018-04-25 15:55:22 Whatever happened to US tight oil being so flexible, they're just like turning on/off the tap; hence, a “new and tighter” range for oil prices?

• a stick of butter (soft), or 100g
• 1/2 dL oil (good one, like avocado)
• 1/2 dL water
• salt to taste

Mix thoroughly with hand mixer between steps.

3841 2018-04-25 15:48:35 I can’t believe people still put on baby oil at the beach. Especially people who are already bright red.
3842 2018-04-25 15:48:34 yes but now you've got lots of oil soaked rag to start a bonfire...

3845 2018-04-25 15:48:23 Crude oil is shipped from Vancouver - a federal port. If not a pipeline delivery, how about 10 unit trains per day, or 3000 tanker trucks, per day?

3853 2018-04-25 15:47:32 Remember that before you can receive and enjoy fresh oil and new wine, there is always the crushing process of the grapes and the olives! Trust the process no matter how hard the grind may get! Do not get weary in well doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not!
3854 2018-04-25 15:47:23 My ex’s mum’s neighbourhood had an HOA that forbid you from washing your car or changing your oil IN YOUR DRIVEWAY. As a person whose Dad always does both those things to save money: WTF?
3855 2018-04-25 15:47:05 Do you have a source for the last part of your comment?  Sincerely asking and not trolling.  That is BS if true.  I know oil companies have been doing things like this in low income states due to gov subsidies. Takes away from education, etc.

3863 2018-04-25 15:46:10 Plantain is a very weird food to fry. You are staring at it in the oil and it will take a while for one side to brown. Blink one sec then its burning. Like ah??
3864 2018-04-25 15:45:55 Thank you so much! I've incorporated the Radiant Glow oil into me & my clients makeup application. I was searching for a while for a new oil, that set well with makeup. I FOUND IT!!!

3868 2018-04-25 15:45:38 Look, if 'Volcano Retch' can get the oil out of my pores, I'm not gonna make a fuss about it.
3869 2018-04-25 15:45:20 Cmon man. You know there are alternatives to dumping untreated sewage too. The oil leak was stopped as soon as it was noticed. Unfortunately some pipelines are in areas not easily accessible. Those processes are constantly being improved unlike the ideals of some people.

3883 2018-04-25 15:43:43 There is no money in cheap oil , America has a large supply of oil , I have a friend who leases his land to big oil companies in Texas , pumps are shut down now he's not making any money .Big Oil is buying on the open market right now  creating a artificial shortage raising price
3884 2018-04-25 15:43:42 that’s a really good idea! i have bath salts i’ve been meaning to use for awhile anyways! also i love using essential oils, i ran out of my lavender oil but i’m definitely gonna get more because that’s my favorite to use when it comes to relaxing lol

The country was in so much debt that Fidel bailed them out in exchange for decades of 60% of Venezuela's oil being given to Cuba for free. Maduro only inherited what his mentor left him.

3892 2018-04-25 15:43:03 Don’t let them eat it. They’ll start asking questions on how to season and which oil is the best to fry in.

3900 2018-04-25 15:42:19 Want to give oil and pipeline companies the middle finger? Burn less gas. Ride your bike or take transit. Fly less.
3901 2018-04-25 15:42:14 smooth transition to a low carbon economyhome run by Macron. Make our economies less dependent on coal,oil and natural gas and still jobs can be created by investing in clean energy.
3902 2018-04-25 15:42:11 IFO that the term "canola oil" is short for "Canada Oil low acid," a name coined to avoid the less marketable word for the product, "rapeseed oil"
3903 2018-04-25 15:42:05 RT @SenatorCantwell: Yesterday I led a Democratic letter to @Interior @SecretaryZinke calling on him to stop preparations for a potential #oil and #gas lease sale in Alaska’s Beaufort Sea. The harsh and fragile Arctic Ocean is incompatible with expanded offshore drilling.

OIL & land!
They couldn’t care less about the people.

What about the mass genocide that they are committing in the Yemen?
The MSM silent!
The Saudi’s with US weapons?
3906 2018-04-25 15:41:52 consider what spawned my original comment, consider the fact that environmentally mindful individuals didnt create a mess while protesting a pipeline Opportunists created a mess while avoiding other responsibilities.Every dollar spent towards oil,is one less spent on the future.
3907 2018-04-25 15:41:49 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.

3909 2018-04-25 15:41:48 should come as no surprise-
fracking opens the shale--which means there is more grit in the oil-
you mean with all their technology they don't understand that?
any housewife colud tell them cheap vacuum cleaner bags are a waste of time-
3910 2018-04-25 15:41:48 Majority of OECD inventory overhang was placed in the US.. I think the bigger question is how much >40 API gravity oil can the rest of the world take? If the US can’t export the incremental barrel from shale then we will have a problem again. #OOTT
3911 2018-04-25 15:41:44 True.
It’s much more likely that I’ll manage to create a working time machine out of dryer lint, speaker wire and recycled French fry oil than that they get it right on a second try.

3929 2018-04-25 15:40:00 Commonly used #herbs to induce #abortion include (but are not limited to) tansy, thuja, safflower, scotch broom, rue, angelica, mugwort, wormwood, yarrow, and essential oil of pennyroyal (Botanical Medicine for Women's Health, 2010).
3930 2018-04-25 15:39:51 Agreed. I would never interfere (or promote interferences) w/ violence between 2 consenting parties willingly engaging in gambling, Ponzi schemes or snake oil trade. I will just tell it as it is, calling the spades spades.

3934 2018-04-25 15:39:35 That's why there should have been a oil fund, like in Norway.

3936 2018-04-25 15:39:32 I hope many big oil believers withdraw donations to the UofA. This will give the UofA more independence from their big oil interests.

3958 2018-04-25 15:37:05 No the pinnacle of a free and democratic society is being ripped off by banks, poisoned by big oil and coal companies, hooked by drug companies, denied and extorted by health insurance companies, wrecked education by private interest.
3959 2018-04-25 15:36:55 Simply untrue. Alberta is exercising their right to tighten the taps on oil. And by all means, YES, B.C. Has no right to stop the construction.
3960 2018-04-25 15:36:54 there have always been folks who by an oil painting so that it "works with the couch"......the rest of us will continue to make our choices outside of the computer aided data projections.....
3961 2018-04-25 15:36:45 My suggestion would be roasted vegetables. Perhaps some broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, etc., tossed in olive oil and herbs and then roasted. My older sister is also vegetarian, so you could say I learned from her!
3962 2018-04-25 15:35:29 False. Just a bunch of whiney whining rightwingers who can't stand the idea that they may be wrong. Oil will not sustain us in the future.
3963 2018-04-25 15:35:24 I use candles sometimes if there’s a lot of oil based going on

3971 2018-04-25 15:34:44 That was fast. Seems like I just saw price was up again yesterday. People should know that a barrel of crude oil is only 42 gallons.

3974 2018-04-25 15:34:35 El número de variables que impactan a una moneda son infinitos. Por eso es tan importante entender que no podemos seguir escuchando a esos analistas monotemáticos que sólo de petróleo vive el #USDCOP. Preguntar por dólar ahora es como preguntar el detalle del #OIL

3979 2018-04-25 15:34:14 Capping the cost of new gas connections might be a good idea. Scotgas are a lot cheaper than Transco in England. It’s a great rip off and why lots of people are stuck with over priced oil and LPG.
3980 2018-04-25 15:34:05 Nobody wants anything from us. They already built a pipeline to suck out the oil right from under us. Why would anyone come to our defense?

3984 2018-04-25 15:33:48 Tamanu Oil and Vitamin C are good to fight/balance dark spots (hyperpigmentation). But the most important product I recommend is using sunscreen all year round, every day. The sun seriously damages your skin, causing scars and breakouts
3985 2018-04-25 15:33:41 They lied to me and told me oil was made from dead dinosaurs .
3986 2018-04-25 15:33:37 I’m sorry Marc,the fossil fuel issue is not an opinion anymore. The oil & gas industry is destroying the planet & poisoning all of us. Scientific research is clear,it is past time to change over to green sustainable energy. It is now’stupid’ of gov’t to invest any new $ in Oil.
3987 2018-04-25 15:33:32 Maine sound like me ima be up early warming up alright, drinking water and trying to get that oil out of me

3999 2018-04-25 15:31:24 You have spent almost $100,000 of our tax $ on postage. @RepBost is not concerned with really helping farmers, just the appearance of helping. You voted to cut the subsidies for farmers for production of ethanol because you obey big oil!!!

4016 2018-04-25 15:29:44 Hey @Barron_Energy - what's the deal with the INE Shanghai crude oil futures contract everyone is talking about? If only there was a This Week In Petroleum Article that would tell me more...
4017 2018-04-25 15:29:23 You can keep your low carbon economy and rely on Russia for oil. We'll choose freedom.
4018 2018-04-25 15:29:19 6/ Yet we are the only country that has these protests. Not the US, not any OPEC nations, not Russia. We do not kill entire villages or start wars for our oil.  We are a leader in human rights

Time we take back this country for Canadians and not give in to foreign interests.

4029 2018-04-25 15:28:10 Fed balance sheet reduction, huge deficit spending, bad geopolitical conflicts, fed tightening, isolationist economics, tariffs the really only hurt the US, trade tensions, oil moving away from the dollar, etc.  

What did you expect?
4030 2018-04-25 15:28:09 Just going to oil all the wheels and box the spare bobbins, distaff etc so they are all done before we get to set up on Friday. Looking forward to seeing all those who are going there! Safe journey to you all.

4035 2018-04-25 15:27:32 I havent tried the oil yet but i will soon☆
4036 2018-04-25 15:27:29 I agree with that if you soften some of the language. Oil will sunset itself, take a breath. Conservatives, outside the oil industry, are for cheaper energy regardless of the form. We don't buy the global warming BS b/c it is just the propaganda you hate in reverse.
4037 2018-04-25 15:27:29 coconut oil is good for the mind, body & soul
4038 2018-04-25 15:27:29 Gas prices in parts of the city up to 1.30 per liter..... oil prices low.... glad the government is stepping in..... oh wait if course they aren't they benefit from this!  #poorergetpoorerrichgetricher

4041 2018-04-25 15:27:20 Liquid/Cream/Oil method! It's used for mantaining moisture and can be used for any hair type. You'd probably just vary the amount of product you'd use depending. You spray your hair with warm-hot water, put on a cream based leave in conditioner. then "seal" it with an oil.
4042 2018-04-25 15:26:52 I just come for oil changes and when my tire pressure is low lol. Like whatever ya gotta fix just fix

4045 2018-04-25 15:26:46 Yesterday I led a Democratic letter to @Interior @SecretaryZinke calling on him to stop preparations for a potential #oil and #gas lease sale in Alaska’s Beaufort Sea. The harsh and fragile Arctic Ocean is incompatible with expanded offshore drilling.
4046 2018-04-25 15:26:46 I love slathering my hair in coconut oil it just feels so soft 
4047 2018-04-25 15:26:43 Location scout photo for oil rig.
4048 2018-04-25 15:26:42 I've never seen any authority to suggest that the % matters. If earth moves to 100% solar energy, and markets for crude oil stay active, does jurisdiction switch from CFTC to SEC at some threshold? I think not.
4049 2018-04-25 15:26:30 Ima still get this oil change though.
4050 2018-04-25 15:26:16 roast whatever veg you're into with garlic, herbs, cumin, other delicious things. dressing: juice of one lemon + a couple of spoons of pesto + oil. mix in a bowl with giant couscous or bulgur wheat, fresh spinach, avocado, tomatoes and fried halloumi on top.
4051 2018-04-25 15:26:13 Manitoba has what it takes to get our oil to market.
4052 2018-04-25 15:25:57 オイルさんで足りないってそれ基本無理では
4053 2018-04-25 15:25:55 Yea yea well I think he’s doing good. I’ve made a lot of money since he’s been in office and the oil field is doing great. He’s got a mess to fix that was left by Obama. Trump is a business man and that’s what we need.
4054 2018-04-25 15:25:54 Just some Oklahoma dipshit whose mentor is an older Oklahoma dipshit who has long maintained climate change is a hoax and is probably elbow deep in the ass of oil companies...sorry, I meant pocket.

4056 2018-04-25 15:25:31 Wait a few more weeks and drink some castor oil 
4057 2018-04-25 15:25:22 So how do you know how somethings prices are controlled/rigged? 
Large amounts of selling or shorting with or without actually owning the asset. 
BTC price was almost $9800, then pow $8925. In 24 hours for no good reason. But oil, natural gas, gasoline prices rise regardless too

4059 2018-04-25 15:25:06 A few shale oil producers. I got tired of bitching about high gas prices. Also felt that because Saudi Arabia was going to do a initial stock offering they would hold fast on quotas allowing domestics to improve their positions. We'll see.
4060 2018-04-25 15:25:06 Chill out on the coffee-mate. It's just corn syrup and vegetable oil.

4062 2018-04-25 15:24:56 Not all Universities are cucked. Pick one that doesn't offer women's studies. Then major in the sciences or engineering.  If you smell patchouli oil...run!
4063 2018-04-25 15:24:54 The issue with housing costs is political. The USA wanted cheap lumber from Canada if oil was included in the deal. There were tariffs and unpaid bills to Canada to get that resolved.
4064 2018-04-25 15:24:51 Zapata is also the name of the Bush Family Oil Consultancy, which was probably begun & operated as a CIA shell corp, used for imperial commercial invasion (eg. oil industry in China) the world over. Curious name, to say the least. Could device be product of skunkworks?

4067 2018-04-25 15:24:32 Last I checked oil was a freely traded commodity and we pay the world price which has been going up. Are you proposing we be like Venezuela and fix a price at the pump?
4068 2018-04-25 15:24:29 Well whoever he/she is, boil yer daft head in oil.

4071 2018-04-25 15:23:48 The issue with oil is pollution and limited future. As long as we cling to starting oil on fire for energy, the rest of the world will move on and leave us behind. And let's face it oil interests have a strangle hold on government.
4072 2018-04-25 15:23:42 The oil baron Henry Sinclair was known to use the same tactic.

4082 2018-04-25 15:22:27 Yes! The "Communist gas gauge", as it says in the video. 

And it was a 2-stroke, so you had to mix gas and oil, even up into the early 1990s.
4083 2018-04-25 15:22:20 "but what about all the oil workers that will be put out of work??" give them benefits and make sure they never have to work another godawful, physically taxing and life shortening job again?

4094 2018-04-25 15:20:16 Do you have any research comparing solar vs fossil fuels in regards to mercury levels and the environment? Refining and burning oil also releases Mercury into the atmosphere....

Rice exports from India are surging dollar is rising.

4110 2018-04-25 15:18:45 3/ The US is profiting from cheap oil that they purchase from Canada for a 40 to 50% discount from what they can purchase on the world market. This is because Canada sells 99% of their exported oil to the US. Look up the price for "Canada Select".

CDA Select $49.79 vs WTI $67.52
4111 2018-04-25 15:18:32 Ugh, it's always safer to do oil & vinegar at Subway. They have a nice RWV, too.
4112 2018-04-25 15:18:27 Oil and gas extraction was the source of past job gains, but Colorado’s future economy is all about inventing new energy. Propping up failing industries like oil& gas with Government bailouts would be like subsidizing outhouses 100 yr ago. Hooray for indoor plumbing! 
4113 2018-04-25 15:18:24 Getting an oil change..... let’s see what else they say I need
4114 2018-04-25 15:18:21 ทำไมหนูขายอะไรที่เค้าไม่ขายในไทยล่ะคะลูก แว๊กซ์ผมงี้ ลิปสติกงี้ ดีหน่อย oil บำรุงนั่นมีขาย
4115 2018-04-25 15:18:18 Been waiting forever for an oil change
4116 2018-04-25 15:18:11 Over 55 gallons of used oil all over the floor when I came to work today

4118 2018-04-25 15:17:45 There are 4 major factors that are responsible for causing #acne. Overactive oil glands, activity of normal skin bacteria, inflammation and blockage of skin pores all act together to produce acne.

4122 2018-04-25 15:17:27 my oil light just came on,,, time to call my mom and complain about this slight inconvenience :))))
4123 2018-04-25 15:17:11 get my oil changed in 10 minutes or less
4124 2018-04-25 15:17:06 This might be a narrow-minded perspective, but I really believe the dividend from the oil price fall was bungled. A more equitable distribution between Govt needs and the consumer could have boosted consumption much higher. But, I suppose hindsight is always 20:20.
4125 2018-04-25 15:17:02 Nestle didn’t demonize Alberta oil,falsely mislabel the “Tar Sands”,call Albertans “slaves”, lead protests against pipelines including KM , etc so the two aren’t really a comparison.
U of A is being tone deaf to the citizens of their province

4141 2018-04-25 15:14:59 Peoples personal beliefs are mostly harmless. The problem comes when a “Christian Coalition” invades politics and imposes their fact-free morality on others, sinking society for worse, be it pro war, anti-gay, forced prayer, pro gun and oil, anti-science, racism, Trumpism, etc.
4142 2018-04-25 15:14:49 2/ Majority of the donations that keep these organizations running come from US Sources such as the Koch Brothers who own refineries and other oil companies in the US. It is in their best interest to keep Canada in a regulatory mess and keep the price for Canadian oil low.

4157 2018-04-25 15:13:17 The hypocrite brigade is alive in Liberal land, import foreign fuel with less regulations than domestic oil. Resist building pipelines but allow and give permits to the same jurisdictions to dump raw sewage into the same waterways.  Let’s say it together HYPOCRITE LIBERALS

4167 2018-04-25 15:12:06 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
4168 2018-04-25 15:11:47 Because having too many pipelines leads to higher per barrel shipping charges and thus exacerbates exactly the discounts you'd hope to minimize. C. F. the time Suncor and other oil sands firms sued US regulators for approving too many pipes.

4173 2018-04-25 15:11:13 Heat oil in a pot. Once it gets hot add jalapeños, cumin, bay leaf, &garlic. Once fragrant add the (rinsed) split peas and coat in the seasoned oil for about 2 min. Add coconut milk, rest of ingredients except cilantro. Let simmer until lentils are soft. Easy peasy!

4175 2018-04-25 15:11:05 Shale oil prices are down, reason the supply of crude oil is high. So, lie to everyone about Iran, stop its supply of oil. Crude prices rise, shale oil again starts production to counter crude,do I say more. #saveirandeal #DonaldTrump #crudeoil #shaleoil

4181 2018-04-25 15:10:27 just walked back into my hotel room from a coffee run and was overwhelmed by the scent of lavender essential oil. I literally abuse #lavender essential oil when I travel. It smells like Provence in here. Housekeeping must be very confused.
4182 2018-04-25 15:10:25 Personally I think having a Pay-per view event in Saudi Arabia is a mistake. But Vince McMahon saw dollar signs from Arabs and their oil money, jizzed himself and bit their hand off.
4183 2018-04-25 15:10:18 cars are all fun & games until you need gas, oil change, tires, brakes and everything else in between.
4184 2018-04-25 15:10:13 Figure you quote is questionable, its from a soft science 3rd party survey & disregards a volume of oil exports. Even so, yes we've a large volume of trade with rUK. How much is going to survive Brexit tho? It relies on complex EU supply chain we've been embedded in for 50 years

4191 2018-04-25 15:09:59 That was the American government. Since America has been in the Middle East, Exxon and other oil companies have buildings there; protected

4193 2018-04-25 15:09:35 Conservatives are always mad that someone, somewhere, might be getting something free - except oil & gas companies, which get about $3.3 billion in govt subsidies a year. God forbid a refugee might get $900 to feed their kids.
4194 2018-04-25 15:09:35 .@CCEssexPolice digital data has been described as a the 'new oil' in terms of its value. It might be better described as 'crude oil' - it needs to be appropriately processed.
4195 2018-04-25 15:09:35 They decided all the current ills are due to the oil price & US sanctions, & moved on. Neither assumption bears the slightest scrutiny.
4196 2018-04-25 15:09:18 The specifics depend on your BMI, bmr and such but yea, big. healthy carbs, minimal fat/oil, high protein 
4197 2018-04-25 15:09:00 .Yeah, we should pentest before patching. I hear all the formula one drivers take their car out to the races without checking tire pressure, fuel levels, oil.. you know basic hygiene

4203 2018-04-25 15:08:23 Think about this for a sec.. Since the US lifted the crude export ban on 12/18/15 US oil production is up 1.41mmbpd while US exports are up 1.83mmbpd.. exports have more then compensated for ever barrel of production growth US shale has produce. #OOTT
4204 2018-04-25 15:08:22 
4205 2018-04-25 15:08:22 Not true. The argument is illogical, it took oil to make their plastic sign, make the steel for the car they drive, etc etc. We cannot get by ourselves to build Nationhood for stupidity.
4206 2018-04-25 15:08:07 Get ready America this is the BS speech that will get us into war with Syria and Iran it’s all about oil in Golan Hights it’s all about divide and conquer keep us in fear so they can control us all. Wake up America

4220 2018-04-25 15:06:47 If your car dealership is recommending an engine flush and you regularly change your oil then the dealership is patently unethical.
4221 2018-04-25 15:06:32 Same thing happening in Venezuela. Except with oil. And everything else that made the economy going.
4222 2018-04-25 15:05:54 Oil prices is far too high! You tell one right thing finally.

4224 2018-04-25 15:05:40 Does anyone know how to do an oil change and would like to do one on my car?! 
4225 2018-04-25 15:05:40 Beautiful series. Can get lost in any of those images for days. And it's difficult to see an oil painting within an oil painting without suspecting the artist has hidden the key to a sublime message in there somewhere.
4226 2018-04-25 15:05:22 Crude oil prices in January 2018 hit a 30 month high. Today oil is trading at $67.88 per barrel compared to $49.33 in April 2017.  It is expected to stay high for the remainder of 2018. Glad my Honda gets 35 MPG.
4227 2018-04-25 15:05:16 Slather the effected areas in Melaleuca oil (tea-tree oil). Insects hate the oil as it dries them out.
4228 2018-04-25 15:05:15 i was going to make a oil painting of girls but i already talked about girls too much to my mom today so i painted yoongi to seem straight

4231 2018-04-25 15:05:02 I did OK with watercolor and ink wash because I could work quickly. Painting with actual paint -- oil, acrylic, or tempera -- was pure torture, though. My pastel studies killed, but getting it onto canvas?

4241 2018-04-25 15:04:07 I'd consider myself much more than being quasi-informed. In fact, I'm very informed on the subject of Oil Movement and Storage. The statistical data on losses and spills from rail car incidents far exceeds that from pipeline losses.

4251 2018-04-25 15:03:02 Heating oil seems the worst of the worst though. Pollutes water when you dig it up. Pollutes air when you burn it. Causes climate change.
4252 2018-04-25 15:03:01 Also, started taking fish oil and @Lamanacka - we really need to get the burpless kind because 
4253 2018-04-25 15:02:52 Any car where oil is optional is my kind of car 
4254 2018-04-25 15:02:45 they must buy oil/energy otherwise the markets goes down - that's all that moved up in 2018
4255 2018-04-25 15:02:44 Who cares about record domestic WTI production, that’s bullish, the world needs our Oil and exports are supporting it. Too bad for those OPEC countries who lost market share
4256 2018-04-25 15:02:33 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
4257 2018-04-25 15:02:28 K: 1 CO2 molecule out of 2500 has zero to do w/ climate, keeping air&water clean.  If you knew science, you'd see how stupid it is being "against climate"?  Do you shake your fist at the rain?Or is it just at God? You prefer oil IN the ground & dead aborted girls sold BY the part

4264 2018-04-25 15:01:29 I was better with acrylic because it dried more quickly, so I could fix mistakes easily, and could also cut it with water and use it like watercolor. Painting in oil, however, was Deep Hurting.

4288 2018-04-25 14:59:51 The Holy oil of Christ decalcifies the 3rd eye and opens it to the divine. It is a requirement of my faith to give it to the sick as Jesus commanded his disciples to do. It heals many problems and is a miracle today as it was then. Amen

4322 2018-04-25 14:57:07 @ClimateDepot 

Hey! So, I need to get rid of a good amount of old motor oil from when I changed out the oil on my '87 Winnebago. Should I just dump it into this stream that I'm currently parked next to? Already thrown my empty bud cans down there, so I feel like I'm committed.
4323 2018-04-25 14:57:05 Wrong - the whole idea of serving the people is not to make $$ off the people you represent. 

It appears you are just fine with politicians punishing an electorate via how they vote -which 99% of gop votes for big Corp- big banks- big Pharm- Big Oil.

4376 2018-04-25 14:50:33 No doubt Texas and Florida would do so much better economically if the government were to tax oil, gas, and electricity. Everyone wants to pay more for fuel, power, transportation, and food. Certainly nothing helps the bottom line more than increasing costs.
4377 2018-04-25 14:50:16 Do some real research on the subject. The GlobalistCabal is behind the funding of the foundations that fund the pipeline protests.  It's about keeping land-locked oil in Alberta thus reducing competition for big US oil. Wake Up! These globalists don't give a shit about your cause

4386 2018-04-25 14:49:41 Every $10 per barrel fall in crude oil price helps reduce retail inflation by 0.2% and wholesale price inflation by 0.5%
4387 2018-04-25 14:49:40 Also, the oil sands have booked three consecutive years of hefty losses after the oil price crash in 2014. Canada, continues its losing streak, with a decrease of 58 oil and gas rigs, after losing 54 rigs last week, and a 29-rig loss the week before.

1) Do Bigfeet shave their bodies and live among us?
2) Was The Little Bighorn battle staged in order to restrict gun ownership?
3) Was WWI a conspiracy by European farming barons to drive up the price of olive oil?

4396 2018-04-25 14:48:24 Oh, if it's part of the last fic, when John comes back to England, no olive oil will be the same. He'll chase that taste and be endlessly disappointed by bland, tasteless oils.

4401 2018-04-25 14:47:53 You know, a larger % of todays russians are dependent on the state than even during the communism.

4403 2018-04-25 14:47:39 If a fall in oil prices by $10 per barrel helps reduce the current account deficit by $9.2 billion, according to a report by Livemint. This amounts to nearly 0.43% of the Gross Domestic Product - a measure of the size of the economy.

This should have been the bedrock of your climate plan, not crushing our economy and oil sector with punitive CO2 taxes. That's just an export tax on 2 million bbls/day of oil to USA

4411 2018-04-25 14:46:23 It won’t be US vs Iran.  It’ll be a “coalition” vs Iran to force an Iranian choice:  Do we want oil revenues, or do we develop nuclear weapons and continue fomenting terrorism in Iraq, Syria, Israel, Yeman and other places.  Never forget the Russians NEED high oil prices.

False conclusion: "The carbon tax doesn’t make people 'reduce their use' of this modern lifeblood, it just costs them a lot of money while not stopping the emissions."
4492 2018-04-25 14:37:59 And to follow up, if you weren't offended, you would not have posted this, and others wouldn't need to feel offended either...

In a way, you are taking part in putting oil to fires that really don't need to be burning. Resist being offended.

4524 2018-04-25 14:34:31 Why, given that Mexico has tourism, minerals, farms, hard workers, OIL/etc, do they need ANY $ from us? Why, given they have all this, is it a 3rd world sh!thole? Why is Japan, which has NONE of this, NOT?

4531 2018-04-25 14:34:04 Oil remains steady. Too soon to be aggressively selling that. Financials want to lead the next rally, as Dodd Franks is ripped to shreds. Consumer goods. What's good for the banks, is good for the consumer, in a credit bubble.
4532 2018-04-25 14:34:02 I thought #oil prices were going up. . . is it time to #buy or #sell?

4546 2018-04-25 14:32:58 I’m aware of price increases... inflation is closer to 10% and ya oil at the same price as last year.. within $10 a barrel yet we are paying over 30 cents a litre more.

YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING, or your electorate will be in destitution before the next election!
4547 2018-04-25 14:32:56 does that mean oil will drop significantly?...

4665 2018-04-25 14:22:26 An illegal oil well was caught fire and killed 10 people in Pasir Putih village, Ranto Peureulak subdistrict, East Aceh.
4666 2018-04-25 14:22:24 One can aim to predict for stability, but on a global scale, Alberta Bitumen is non competitive. Prices are too volatile, and major oil producers are realizing this. Why else ask for a government bailout?
4667 2018-04-25 14:22:14 What about those medicine in yellow box,, di harmans I think they are called. They say it calms the baby down and I say if you give a baby meds with 47%ethonol in it what do you expect. Baby will sleep. I refused to give my kids, same as di castor oil or laxatives.
4668 2018-04-25 14:22:09 Di ko alam kung ano uunahin ko at gagawin e kapag nakikita ko mga paint ko dito sa bahay.. Gusto ko magpaint , kapag nakikita ko yung oil pastel ko gusto ko magposter  kapag naman mga lapis ko nakikita ko drawing naman, tas kapag mga ballpen naman lettering  anu ba talaga? 
4669 2018-04-25 14:21:58 Actually, rather than oil companies, it’s likely the money behind those companies. Think rich foundations that make their money from oil company dividends, or big investment funds that manage billions of $ in stocks. They are the manipulators.
4670 2018-04-25 14:21:47 The left rewards the left for wrongdoing and praised bad people. He was a snake oil salesman selling equality Thru division & forcing all poor while forcing a Muslim radical world invasion to force globalism & 1 world order.

4672 2018-04-25 14:21:29 Question as to whether all of that was adjustment from oil or adjustment from CBN policy. I think both. So they shouldn’t get credit for final result (which didn’t have to be that big).
4673 2018-04-25 14:21:22 Guess we may never know. One thing is for certain. Country was going to shit. Abuja was hit 3 times by BH. Oil prices dropped...

4803 2018-04-25 14:07:37 Palm oil is a very big focus for us right now, and we're pleased to confirm that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our snacks. We've shared your feedback with the team about this :)
4804 2018-04-25 14:07:36 You'd think an oil rich country would be able to use it's vast resource to deal with basic infrastructure issues wouldn't you!? where did all the money go?

4806 2018-04-25 14:07:28 Plz just change my oil and wash my car like I came here for
4807 2018-04-25 14:07:20 Oil edged higher on Wednesday, nearing three-year highs reached the previous day, as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market.
4808 2018-04-25 14:07:18 Drinking motor oil can't he healthy 
4809 2018-04-25 14:07:13 only i would come to the dealership for an oil change. and decide i want to trade my whole car in.  impulsive much.
4810 2018-04-25 14:07:10 Best oven to gas 4. Peel beetroot and cut into wedges. Roast for 1 hour with 1tbsp olive oil. Fry chopped onion and garlic for 3 mins. Add rice stir through. Add wine and bubble for 3 mins then stock. Cover and cook for 15 mins. Puree 1/4 beetroot chop rest. When risotto cooked
4811 2018-04-25 14:06:55 OIL 1H continue tracking below 20MA=68.12, but did move back above 200MA=67.67 "nowhere" zone. I've set up limit order above and below this "zone" as EIA report release in 24 minutes.
4812 2018-04-25 14:06:44 That's what i use the vitamin e oil for and I've definitely noticed a difference in my scarring
4813 2018-04-25 14:06:41 Me and my boyfriend were doing anal and it fell out when we tried to switch positions. I looked back to grab his dick but it was covered in poop. So I had to sneak clean it up. I grabbed the closest thing: coconut oil and a sock to wipe it off. Better luck next time-Gram
4814 2018-04-25 14:06:26 FAM! Was in Indy that whole weekend, downtown was packed with Packers fans, so was Lucas oil, they celebrated until mid 3rd quarter

4817 2018-04-25 14:06:17 まあでも、気持ちはありがたかった。
4818 2018-04-25 14:06:13 You have no idea what you are speaking about. The US has oil reserves...lots of oil reserves. In addition, we have a lot of shut in wells which can be opened for more oil. Stop trying to scare people. You don't have a clue.

4820 2018-04-25 14:06:05 Then the 1 guess is right, looking 4 cheap Oil from a country in war & its not impossible in this conditions to get lucky with a tanker full of cheap oil under the market price since it is a war zone & everyone is in charge ,plus the difficulty of local or international control.
4821 2018-04-25 14:06:00 My hair is dead ass thick afCk  & i hate it cause come wash condition & hot oil treatment day i be ready to cry cause I’m so tender headed.

4823 2018-04-25 14:05:49 If Trump drops out of the Iran deal, the demand for Russian oil will shoot up.

4825 2018-04-25 14:05:37 My @Ford Edge engine fails at 52k miles and ZERO financial assistance from Ford. Their reason: 3 services ago I went 13k miles between oil changes.  Engines don’t fail at 52k miles with Ford’s own synthetic oil due to an extra 3k miles between one service.  $6200 to fix on my own

4831 2018-04-25 14:04:37 Plus again, WWE doesn't actually care about the culture, they just want that oil money.

4834 2018-04-25 14:04:28 What people don't realize is higher oil/gas prices will practically negate his bullshit tax cuts for ordinary people..same thing with the bush tax cuts after 9/11..folks are too stupid to understand this..

4838 2018-04-25 14:04:12 Oily skin? It's still OK to use cream foundation. Apply it with a damp makeup sponge, which picks up the pigment but not the product's oil.

4840 2018-04-25 14:04:08 The Yuan story wasn't a pump. More of a long term structural change. Either way, the XAU is at 1998 levels. Oil is up, gold is down. It's going to be fun to watch the gold mining sector go bankrupt over the coming days.
4841 2018-04-25 14:03:53 The enemies job is to get you to give in and quit. Press past the pressure and keep going. Before the oil is produced there must be some crushing.

4845 2018-04-25 14:03:25 There's plenty of talk of Oil going to $80 barrel. Where were the bulls back on 1/13/15 (when oil was @ $48) & Bell Curve made the call: The “new normal” in Oil: $90.00 the top of the range, $60.00 is “fair value”, & $39.00/$30.00 is where the market should bottom out #NYMEX #Oil
4846 2018-04-25 14:03:21 Free speech should include multiple points of view. If we are paying for the university then Forbes has every right to speak as Suzuki who will likely come get his degree and speak against the oil sands while he is here. Roy doth protest too much.
4847 2018-04-25 14:03:15 100ml of oil?
4848 2018-04-25 14:02:46 Amen and amen, mouth is the factory for so much favor, blessing and favor to you mentor qualifies you for his anointing oil change in my life assignment, have a very good day walking with the holy spirit teaching wisdom of love, joy ,love you much,
4849 2018-04-25 14:02:40 I'm not glossing,  I worked an helped to build part of the Oil Sands project, it is truly an engineering marvel. Happy to show you around; we'll have to use a helicopter powered with leaded hydro carbons however, unless your ok with just a ground tour in hybrid. This is my invite
4850 2018-04-25 14:02:25 But historically, it's not like it suddenly just spikes, in a matter of months - oil shocks excepted. For instance, it took almost 3 years for CPI to go from +2.5% in September 1967 to +6.2% in January 1970. It went up by just over 1% a year.

4856 2018-04-25 14:01:54 Sorry about the "boondoggle" thing. I was going to use the snake oil salesman metaphor, but decided to use the word boondoggle to be different. It sounded better in my head.  I guess it's a sad commentary on my inner voice.
4857 2018-04-25 14:01:48 It will not be turned into an industrialised landscape. Please do some research. You won't even know it's a production oil field. Everything is hidden undergoing and safe. It will create more jobs too. The UK economy will benefit.

4862 2018-04-25 14:01:24 As oil ages, it gets less bitey. Real unfiltered should only be used fir 6 months, the bits spoil. But they gravity settle it and take the oil off the sunken sediment. Go 18 months. As a Brit, John wouldn't have had much oil that tastes anything like it, even in summer.

4865 2018-04-25 14:01:05 The yield on the 10-year Treasury is one of the most closely watched financial measures in the world. Its hallowed status is up there with the U.S. dollar, the price of gold and the price of oil. We should ll probably learn more about this.

4875 2018-04-25 14:00:19 Betrayed?? Dr Turpin said free speech & debate is hallmark of a university. Indeed imperative of it. It is hypocritical to accept Suzuki’s condemnation of oil industry in Alberta & then criticize Forbes condemnation of a taxpayer funded institution. Why would you discriminate?

4880 2018-04-25 13:59:43 I found a bunch of $2-4 artist grade oil paints in a corner in the basement of ex-libris

4881 2018-04-25 13:59:41 The previous week it had an emergency landing at LTN with no oil in either engine, don't think it was ever the same again.
4882 2018-04-25 13:59:40 I am going to start investing in Oil
4883 2018-04-25 13:59:28 Looks like OIL 
4884 2018-04-25 13:59:26 Personally, I think they'd be better off getting a job on an oil rig for a few years and reading the Stoics. But complaining about women and doing nothing to improve oneself is easier, I guess.

4886 2018-04-25 13:59:17 Thanks for this. I stopped working clinically for the same reasons. The years following grad are the worst. You do your best to do good-but system, other HCPs and society don’t allow you do good. Being questioned on why you aren’t the typical snake oil merchant gets tiring

4888 2018-04-25 13:59:01 ...were strapped for cash. Braniff failed because of the oil crisis of 1979, which was, in turn, caused by the Iranian Revolution that brought the Ayatollah to power. So, basically, Islamists made grunge possible.

4891 2018-04-25 13:58:44 This is EXACTLY what happened to Venezuela tons of jobs during the big oil boom and then suddenly no jobs, they could of been a  nation rich in agricultural resource  yet they gave it all up to go socialist now they have no  agricultural industry whatsoever and look at them now
4892 2018-04-25 13:58:38 Just reminded me that I need an oil change 
4893 2018-04-25 13:58:37 When will @DPJHodges expose @jeremycorbyn for supplying the fuel that allowed NAZI planes to bomb the UK?

Oh no, that was American companies.

Maybe he provided the fuel for the Pearl Harbour attack?

Oh no that was Standard Oil again.

4904 2018-04-25 13:57:14 Gas prices in Edmonton are near record cost.  Oil was $146 per barrel last time (2008). Oil is around $64 this time.  
4905 2018-04-25 13:57:12 I modified mine a bit to make it better. I bought pure MCT oil off Amazon, which is what’s in coconut oil...I also put a little cayenne...which helps with metabolism...some raw cacao for flavor and for nutrients...a little almond milk...and some Stevia.
4906 2018-04-25 13:57:11 No... i just made a hair mask and its w olive oil and vingar and it fell from my hair right on my face and i THInk the drop made my face red
4907 2018-04-25 13:57:07 -Free to liken Alberta’s oil sands industry to slavery and Albertans’ desire for jobs as “immoral”. Fine, it’s a free country, but wrong for @UAlberta to honour him after spouting rubbish that borders on hate speech. He just wants the public podium to further disparage Albertans.

4912 2018-04-25 13:56:44 There’s a backlog of train cars right now that need to be moved. Farmers in sask can’t move their grain, pretty sure the rail workers would be fine if oil was moved the way it should be moved, in a pipeline and the farmers would be much happier too.
4913 2018-04-25 13:56:29 Weird, but I would still recommend a watch.
4914 2018-04-25 13:56:23 A vassal of a tiny state thousands of miles away w minuscule fraction of GDP of largest oil producer. Seems legit ;)
4915 2018-04-25 13:55:59 So he should stick to genetics.  He has knowingly misled people in regards to oil, fish farming and GMO’s ... all for his own fame and fortune.  He is an alarmist, not a scientist.
4916 2018-04-25 13:55:58 Yeah I've been looking into oils a lot because I'd like to be as natural as I can, and def have to keep it simple cause it's not like I get much time to myself now lol I've read that rosehip oil is great for acne scars so i might try that too

You think only people who agree with you should get honorary degrees and I think you and industry should have tougher hides and do a better job explaining to the world why Alberta (oil sands, pipelines, etc) deserves to be supported.

4927 2018-04-25 13:54:42 @TheThreeKingsCo this health shop is something very special indeed’ for CBD Oil also ProBiotics and much more. For cancer sufferers these guys know their stuff. Top service and honest people who help people in need 
4928 2018-04-25 13:54:28 There are also structural forces supporting the energy sector, w/effectively no new conventional oil discoveries in the past few yrs & shale infrastructure incapable of meeting shortfall (Permian takeouts stymied by bottlenecks / lack of transport capacity / pipeline infra)
4929 2018-04-25 13:54:25 Can we start protesting oil prices again? This is ridiculous.
4930 2018-04-25 13:53:39 I am not as pessimistic as you. shale will ramp up quickly and put brakes on oil. Solar is already making some dent. India is second only to China in ramping up solar. We are moving as fast as we can.
4931 2018-04-25 13:53:38 Fone on 6 and I’m getting her an oil change 
4932 2018-04-25 13:53:26 New-ish phrases I'm already fatigued by but will continue to flourish because people feel cool and smart when they say it: "Data is the new oil" and "the US is the new Saudi Arabia."
4933 2018-04-25 13:53:18 Think it's the reduction of dietary animal fat and increased seed oil consumption? Compounded by slathering skin with chemicals if we do go out in the sun.. 
4934 2018-04-25 13:53:14 Thanks for the invite Ziya, but it might be more productive to bring you to the Oil Sands for a tour. It's an engineering marvel, that should be enhanced and improved not a monster to be slain as you people want.
4935 2018-04-25 13:53:10 So 1 barrel of Brent crude #oil now costs more than $75 - highest level in more than 3yrs. Supply cuts in oil-producing countries & rising demand are largely to blame. #Iran 's oil production has surged in recent years. Any new restrictions could reduce amount it pumps on mrkt

4940 2018-04-25 13:52:21 Go see U of C. They’re completely owned by the oil lobby.

4943 2018-04-25 13:51:50 Prices of oil, natural gas, coal set to rise by 20% this year: World Bank

Prices for energy commodities like oil, natural gas and coal are expected to jump by a whopping 20 per cent this year, the World Bank has said in a report.
4944 2018-04-25 13:51:49 It is disturbing that in this country with the 3rd highest oil reserves in world that any part of Canada has to pay these prices.  Of course Vancouver is an exception where voting in tax and spend politicians has resulted in highest gas taxes in NA.
4945 2018-04-25 13:51:44 If someone retweets the propaganda of America (anyone that supports American Wars for Oil, for example) does that make them an American bot?

That would make just about every reporter on television, every News Channel, every blogger that reposts the narrative an American bot.

4948 2018-04-25 13:51:31 Yeah to have their wages eat up by the oil companies.
4949 2018-04-25 13:51:26 Hard to say due to beta of CVE. It is a buy hold here, for me. I don't aim for best price, but a good price. #'s are good, environment is bad. If environment +'s, so will #'s.  That is positive. The stored oil will be sold, likely at a higher net return to its original prod date.
4950 2018-04-25 13:51:24 How do we get oil out of vegetables to make vegetable oil?

4955 2018-04-25 13:50:59 I got my oil changed, car washed and a full tank before work, ON MY DAY OFF. What have you done today 
4956 2018-04-25 13:50:56 I remember adding castrol oil to my curry instead of sun flower oil 
4957 2018-04-25 13:50:51 Why the oil price in the world falls, and the petrol price grows in Russia? Probably, with what petrol dilute rises in price.

4962 2018-04-25 13:50:21 That said. We could see more pressure on managed FX like Naira, though arguably it should be been allowed to appreciate more in last few months give oil ToT. And as you say, key question on China.
4963 2018-04-25 13:50:19 Or that the owner of the whole thing literally hired mercenaries to seize a rival company's oil fields. IN RUSSIA.
4964 2018-04-25 13:50:01 hm i read that OVER washing can actually make it worse cuz ur skin freaks out and over produces oil but dunno how true it is  

tbh the only thing that has ever helped my (bad) skin is drinking a fckton of water 
4965 2018-04-25 13:49:56 We need to scale up renewables including renewable fuels (decreasing costs) and freeze new oil and gas developments and projects and begin to shutter fossil fuel plants. We can't be building coal and gas plants and pipelines while trying to bring on solar, wind, storage etc.
4966 2018-04-25 13:49:52 It might seem expensive, but actually it’s one of the cheapest pure oil products out there if you consider the true milligram of cbd oil that is in each capsule 10-15 mg in each, and out tinctures are all 2 Oz bottles. The cheap is likely not the real stuff.

4982 2018-04-25 13:47:56 Jerry, understand your concern but emerging 2018 YC honors falling CI. It may prove to be a "false" trend b/c of market pessimism about marginal cost of tight oil and its abundance. Still, it is the present emerging trend, like  it or not, until more data warrants a change.
4983 2018-04-25 13:47:41 知ってた、
4984 2018-04-25 13:47:30 Just to enlighten some twitties that the money given to Iran by US & EU belonged to them earned through sale of oil & gas and withheld by US & EU banks as part of sanctions. Trump is spreading lies to ill informed people
4985 2018-04-25 13:47:29 Also an oil removing dish soap (dawn here idk if you guys have it) will help
4986 2018-04-25 13:47:16 Quebec imports 650k barrels of oil a day at WTI prices. Canadian Oil discount is $25 a barrel. If I am doing the math right that means importing over using our resources is costing Quebec just under 6B a year. Energy East pays for itself is less then 2 yrs. does this make sense

4999 2018-04-25 13:45:41 In many ways, if oil wanted to be stubborn, it's not just the 10 year yield going above 3% that has markets shook. OPEC won't get their wish of $100 a barrel again.

5001 2018-04-25 13:45:26 I think this conviction, unmitigated, can lead to that. I’m sure they think they have enough oil or they would have brought more. I think having the oil in lamps only reflects their confidence He’s coming earlier. Many fall away (apostasy, 2 Th 2:3)—some endure (Mt 24:9-13).

5060 2018-04-25 13:38:36 Art, I disagree I see the CI dropping and a shortfall with more upward demand on Shale and higher prices to operate ( confusing yes ) and I see $85 Oil by July ( and we are forgetting the yearly decline curves )
5061 2018-04-25 13:38:35 Core of  hot, dookie , soil, water makes a component in crude oil.
5062 2018-04-25 13:38:34 So gas just jumped the most expensive it's been here since 2008 when oil was over 140 a barrel and its currently less than 70. They say because summer is the heavy driving season... But I drive more in the winter than the summer because why drive when you can walk?
5063 2018-04-25 13:38:14 This former A.G. of Oklahoma, yes man to Oil and Gas, appointed to head the EPA, I think was the BIGGEST slap in the face that Trump has given this country, and former leaders that did the "right thing" for preserving the environment..OUR FUTURE!!

5073 2018-04-25 13:36:49 The world should be awash in cheap oil but thanks to the stable genius in the White House and his mishandling of the Iran deal we’re going to see the price of oil going up and up.

Sanctioning #Iran out of supporting groups to undermine weaker neighbors won't work unless they do the same to #Saudi_Arabia. Can anyone tell me what's in it for France to side with the Saudis? Is the #EU offering them something?
5088 2018-04-25 13:35:51 The difference in our gas prices compared to the US is that here our Government allows collusion between oil companies and every time the Liberals need more money well then, Walla add another tax onto gas,plus it's a tax on a tax so Bonus but yes don't Import Oil, Produce
5089 2018-04-25 13:35:46 By the way, we offer a unique transformer oil that can and has proven to give power companies back as much as 5% in lost transformer capacity across their electrical grid. We would like the opportunity to test/demonstrate this in Siemens lab. Who is the POC?

5125 2018-04-25 13:31:27 Yeah. It's basically a pigovian tax in Georgist terms.

I think it would hasten decarbonisation so long as the cost of CO2 output was high enough to ensure that renewable sources become cheaper by default. As such it would have to be tied to the price of oil/gas.

5191 2018-04-25 13:22:02 Toys R Us had the 2nd largest market share of toy sales in the US. Their execs decided oil (I think) was more sustainable and sold it to a liquidation firm, though. I’m not sure anyone wanted it.

You can totally buy toys online, though.

5193 2018-04-25 13:21:47 If you think people are coming home, you are sadly mistaken. Understand one thing, as long as oil is a cash commodity and sold on a market, we will never leave the Middle East.
5194 2018-04-25 13:21:35 $CAD correlated with oil. #Oil on the rise, Buying  CAD is  great way to play the oil rush
5195 2018-04-25 13:21:26 Couple that with export quotas that required production be sold to СИВ at prices in convertible rubles below production cost and there were only three options to stabilise the economic situation, export drugs, export weapons to OPEC, lie about oil needs and re-export Soviet oil.
5196 2018-04-25 13:21:05 I don't hear you appreciating the billions in subsidies that we give AB-based oil interests.

5203 2018-04-25 13:20:16 Common factors are greed & lust. Oil in persian gulf attracted Britain &America. Sone ki Chidiya(India) attracted Alexander, Muslim & European invaders. Iran,middle east countries,Kashmir became victims.
5204 2018-04-25 13:20:15 Oil change appointment at 8am, I get here early to still be here at 920am. It’s just an oil change and only 3 cars here I’m confused.

5211 2018-04-25 13:19:34 No, she wants oil leases on Coastal #ANWR despite @Interior predicting a 75% chance of that causing a major ecological disaster. The @blm comment period has been abbreviated to 2 months, not publically viewable, and is somewhat difficult to add to, but I have the link posted.
5212 2018-04-25 13:19:34 Did you hear the earnings guidance yesterday? Do you understand what will happen as the Fed normalizes rates? Commodity prices are doing nothing but rising. Oil prices are at 4 year highs. Keep your head in the sand if you'd like.

5225 2018-04-25 13:17:05 Venezuela's economy crashed after oil prices plummeted, as it had an overdependence on petroleum exports (approx 50% of revenue). Great Depression was a reaction to the financial crash, and many parts of the US haven't recovered despite finance being 12% of your economy.

5229 2018-04-25 13:16:37 Same amount of oil.  They just bought out partner (Conoco).  They used to get half. Conoco half.  Those who are too stupid to know should keep quiet.

5232 2018-04-25 13:16:15 Great news! How does this compare to total industry generation though? Curious at what rate we’re closing the gap of oil/coal based generation to solar/wind. Does “new” just mean there were more wind farms built those 2 months than new coal power plants?

5247 2018-04-25 13:14:43 Coconut oil is everything
5248 2018-04-25 13:13:52 potassium, cod liver oil and taurine. Not sure how much those 3 helps but they certainly don't make it worse. Oh, and I always have a fan on so that helps with the overheating issue! haha.
5249 2018-04-25 13:13:39 Ironic that venezuela all but destroy itself but Venezuelans are fixated on annexing neighboring Guyana because the discover couple billion barrels of oil. This is same Venezuela that have the largest oil reserves in the world, around 300 billion barrel.
5250 2018-04-25 13:13:36 also blending it is key, because if the MCT oil is not emulsified it pretty much just stays at the top
5251 2018-04-25 13:13:10 Did you mean something like groundnuts oil
5252 2018-04-25 13:13:10 If oil prices stay the same or decline and cost of capital increases markedly, yes.  But if the increase in oil prices is higher than the increase in cost of capital: they will invest more.
5253 2018-04-25 13:12:59 Happy Birthday pal. I'll get you that nude as soon as I oil up.

5266 2018-04-25 13:11:30 I understand that that barrel of oil has gone up but it wasn’t that long ago that the barrel was trading at $100 and fuel still wasn’t this high? I live in Alberta and we’re paying the cheapest fuel in the country. Rumor has it in BC that it’s going to jump to damn near $2/Liter
5267 2018-04-25 13:11:24 The refinery needs to be built close to the source.  (This should be elementary) There was a refinery in Taylor, BC to process NE BC oil.  The problem with dilbit,transport, logically or not, is that it's dilbit being transported.  refined wouldn't be as controversial.

5313 2018-04-25 13:05:16 Sir, why are you doing this?

Are you trying to convince X person on the internet about something?

The answer is: NO. US can't do without middle east oil right now.

If you convinced me, it has no bearing on decision makers, as nobody cares about your or my opinion.

5327 2018-04-25 13:02:34 Offered eggs and got my entire forehead and hands oiled today. Ung face ko literal na oily. Not complaining, blessed oil naman. 
5328 2018-04-25 13:02:23 An oil tanker for you!
5329 2018-04-25 13:02:20 not sure why you keep insisting.

It is logical that if USA could do without middle east oil, it'd have done it.
5330 2018-04-25 13:02:19 What’s your thoughts on CBD Oil? I have spasticity 24/7 in my legs sooo painful with it and very heavy. Could it help? x
5331 2018-04-25 13:02:13 Interesting. The ones who want to stop the pipeline oppose coal and oil as a fuel. Clean energy from nat. gas helps the environment and provides cheaper electricity and heating. You might say these folks cannot see the forest for the trees.
5332 2018-04-25 13:02:07 Dm@oil_noob
Hello. What's oil doing today?
5333 2018-04-25 13:02:00 'Yes we beat Firebird to top oil boiler!' 
5334 2018-04-25 13:01:53 You said we need oil as justification for SYRIA.  I said we already found it locally.  But that new reactors are in development that mean proxy wars for energy are pointless.  Esp when you have billions of barrels of oil untapped. Clearer?
5335 2018-04-25 13:01:48 I eventually said "You know what? Spit-tooth peckerwoods down South have been doing this for decades with a campfire and some hog fat, fuck flaxseed oil and lye, I'm going for it."
5336 2018-04-25 13:01:41 Because we cling on to Oil, Gas, Coal, and Nuclear to provide most of America's power...
5337 2018-04-25 13:01:35 What should women avoid when trying to get pregnant? Alcohol, high mercury fish, deli meats, simple carbs, trans-fat, and flaxseed oil.  What should they increase? lentils, quinoa, and millet; salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds; and all types of berries. #IVFMD #pregnancy

5340 2018-04-25 13:01:17 Same here. Personally I’d like to see a league dominated by United Liverpool arsenal and spurs. Clubs built on hard work and success. Clubs that have passionate fans. Not a bunch of oil well funded shit shows with no one you can troll after a game.

5342 2018-04-25 13:01:06 Finally got some pain meds but it hurts so bad it's slow working. But went to the best dispensary and got some good co2 Golden extract. 82% the got a new pen that's works better. Some of you going through this.  I'm in a legal state. Im fortunate. Finally scraped to get some oil.

5348 2018-04-25 13:00:04 @GoMaxGoFoods Earth Day got me thinking about how to reduce my impact... love your #vegan chocolate but notice there’s palm oil in many of your products. can you tell me is it ethnically sourced? Are there any plans to replace palm oil with something else that is less damaging?

5354 2018-04-25 12:59:31 Can't help but feel that the letter is pouring oil on a fire.
Whilst I applaud his personal values it does make you wonder what it takes in terms of fan power to understand he is wrong.
5355 2018-04-25 12:59:05 Drizzle merely adds a slight bit of water to oil & transmission fluid on the road surface, making it slick. A heavy rain washes it away to a large degree, reducing the slickness.

Any other questions?
5356 2018-04-25 12:59:01 Did it rain vegetable oil this morning? I've seen 5 accidents in Greater Upper Marlboro in the last 10 minutes.
5357 2018-04-25 12:58:51 Oh god no. Since I’ve been out of work i made a half of flower and 5 grams of oil last me. Just ran out a few days ago.
5358 2018-04-25 12:58:48 Not true.  Recent finds off Shetland prove we do not need oil.  Fission or Fusion Reactor in development in UK to be fully operational by 2030.  So proxy wars of energy are exactly that.
5359 2018-04-25 12:58:46 40 years of oil and look at Aberdeen now, you'd never think it was Europe's oil capitol, 40 years of a precious resource being squandered by Westminster, Scotland the only country with oil who's economy hasn't boomed!
5360 2018-04-25 12:58:38 @PeterSchiff hey, love the podcast. I need to reallocate my 401k. Right now it’s aggressive. You have been warning about the market and recommend gold. Also heard you mention you were long in oil. What % should I move to gold and oil? And what names should I look for? Thx!
5361 2018-04-25 12:58:35 came to the dealership for a 40 dollar oil change and they’ve suckered me into a 60 dollar air filter. this doesn’t happen at lube stop bro.
5362 2018-04-25 12:58:21 All the Al-etc etc is saudi-US- israel products now france- may have joined with them to control the crude oil on which the region is floating 
5363 2018-04-25 12:58:01 I wonder why there isn't much talk about the oil sands workers who had to stay behind and were only given a paper mask.
I've heard of situations where employees were refused any mask!!!!
5364 2018-04-25 12:57:57 Oliv oil /?
5365 2018-04-25 12:57:54 When Pruitt's EPA picks which oil refineries have to play by the rules and which ones get a free pass, its easy to understand why they are upset.
5366 2018-04-25 12:57:47 It is misleading, it mixes up NatGas with Crude oil.

two different things
5367 2018-04-25 12:57:42 It’s like you didn’t read the article.. 4 is too much if we ever want to have a chance at developing socially and economically. If Oil ever becomes obsolete we’ll be FUCKED as a country. Can u think Zimbabwe!
5368 2018-04-25 12:57:31 Body oil. I'll be there tomorrow.

5370 2018-04-25 12:57:14 the #Iran deal was "insane and ridiculous" but @realDonaldTrump's commetns on #oil [ricing are even more so. U.S.needs $65 oil not $25
5371 2018-04-25 12:57:13 Gotta go get this oil change
5372 2018-04-25 12:57:07 @cspanwj The Earth itself has run on Solar, Wind, and Tidal Power forever ...Mother nature stored all that oil deep and far away from use...We might take a lead from our Mother Earth.
5373 2018-04-25 12:56:36 I have a half day today but I got a doctors appointment and then gotta get an oil change  growing older is not fun  i just wanna take a nap
5374 2018-04-25 12:56:19 Thank you gents! Venezuelans will not forgot this one; on coming years after Chavism ask for oil to Cuba but not Vzla anymore! 

NEEDHUMANITARIANHELPINVZLAPROPLEAREDYING
5375 2018-04-25 12:56:16 And CNN thinks Russian interference is the cause of all US problems. US interference in Canada is far more insidious. There's US$ behind the pipeline protests in Canada. The only pipelines protested in the US will carry CDN oil.
5376 2018-04-25 12:56:09 And in the 70’s they told us the oil in the ground world wide was drying up... and we waited on gas lines every other day for 10 dollars of gas!..... don’t believe any of it!!!
5377 2018-04-25 12:56:07 Gonna be spending a tad bit more than I expected today for my oil change.  I apparently declined changing my air filters   oops.  And I apparently declined rotating my tires  oops.

5382 2018-04-25 12:55:56 Some of this strikes me as faux rage. Albertans who rage when anyone has concerns about our oil industry gets a bit old. This is not the province of Oilberta.
5383 2018-04-25 12:55:55 I concur,  I think they actually make these jobs up in the swamp , what kind of "un american" leach would be Asst.

5386 2018-04-25 12:55:29 Oil companies know that the world depends and will continue to need their products for many years until a yet to be discovered alternative is found.
5387 2018-04-25 12:55:27 Over time KSA would’ve sought to balance Saddam via ties w Egypt & Pakistan (militarily) & Iran (oil & politically). Maybe Uday & Qusay would’ve inherited the regime. One Q is Jordan: would there be a peace treaty w Israel? Would US have defended Jordan vs Saddam’s domination?
5388 2018-04-25 12:55:26 Y’all have oil on your face and be talking about your skin glowing. Duh
5389 2018-04-25 12:55:25 @cspanwj  Mr. Deans you do understand that Obama administration gave leases where they knew there was no oil don't you?
5390 2018-04-25 12:55:20 I’ve heard you can use olive oil to remove makeup but I don’t like the idea of messing with the ph levels of my face by using oil on it so often
5391 2018-04-25 12:55:18 I initially stressed out going down the rabbit hole of best oil, best method, and so on and so on but after the first coat came out so nice it's actually weirdly fulfilling to get the oil on and go through the whole heating/cooling process.
5392 2018-04-25 12:55:17 Yep,,we being cheated again by the oil companies,,just like our government it screwing us over on taxes....

Greetings All,
It still never ceases to amaze me why the development of "Value Added" seems to be a phrase that is lost in the conversation when it comes to our resources - the word
Refinery in particular
when it comes to Oil
Isn't it easier to deal with ?
Cheers
5399 2018-04-25 12:54:07 Syria again ties to oil and gas.  And also eu expansion.  BRAND Democracy has f*cked up enough of ME and ought to leave it alone.

5402 2018-04-25 12:53:56 looks like an oil stain to me lol
5403 2018-04-25 12:53:52 Getting my oil changed before seeing @hodgman & @JeanGreasy at @BellHouseNY tonight, because I can’t look at my odometer and not think of @RheaButcher stressing the importance of regular oil changes on “Judge John Hodgman.”

5410 2018-04-25 12:53:05 Maybe your breakout wasnt because of cleansing oil. Maybe because of other product? You have to know your skintype and sensitivity of your skin to certain ingredients.
5411 2018-04-25 12:52:42 Is it the Jews? The oil rich Arabs? Is it the queen of England? The federal reserve? Or even the Rothschild?

5418 2018-04-25 12:51:14 No. No. No.  Iran is part of a plan that then goes to SOMALIA and SOUTH PAKISTAN.  And it involves more immigration. And more displacement. And for fewer people to be in control of oil and gas.  Been on the cards for 20 years at least. Yemen? For Socotra Island. FYI.
5419 2018-04-25 12:51:13 Since 2012 there have been more jobs in renewables and clean tech than oil, and these jobs are in the communities where the workers live. #solar #wind #water #geothermal #efficiency

5431 2018-04-25 12:50:08 Good point. Shale's growth/contribution relied on cheap debt, hence unsustainable. We  can expect to see paper turn to junk as interest rates/debt load/defaults rise. Furthermore, as productivity continues to decline higher priced oil becomes unaffordable.
5432 2018-04-25 12:50:00 Dollar and treasury yields are going up. Short term pain for raw materials.  Planning to listen to earnings call for $GG.

5443 2018-04-25 12:48:55 Good question- it may depend on source of Fx earnings. It would seem to me that the concurrent oil price trend would limit some of the pressure on gcc pegs especially as some of the portfolio inflows (Saudi) are offsetting continued private outflows.

Oil is supposed to be a blessing not a curse.
5451 2018-04-25 12:48:08 The differentials were caused by lack of infrastructure and to some extent crude quality.   Lower dollar means higher global demand for oil, and by default higher demand for US crude

5454 2018-04-25 12:47:20 Weather the oil industry likes it or not Suzuki is right. The sooner we get off oil the better. We can’t do it over night and we have to think about jobs but the transition is important. What’s wrong with innovating a new industry that’s healthier for everybody?

5554 2018-04-25 12:33:29 With demand for vegetable oils growing fast we need consumers to help increase pressure on companies to switch to sustainable palm oil. Global use of sustainable palm oil will ultimately protect more wildlife than allowing unsustainable practices to continue.

5574 2018-04-25 12:29:59 whats a foundation got to do with whether oil is found or not at Icewine?  Go and ask Dave Wall some hard hitting questions.  Make him sweat and uncomfortable, then see what you think.  Try Stephen Slaley as well, might be a better bet. All IMO.
5575 2018-04-25 12:29:55 What is the impact of the alternatives? Replacement of one oil for another would not solve the problem but only shift it elsewhere. We'd encourage Iceland to work with the rest of the supply chain to promote the use of sustainable standards, such as RSPO.
5576 2018-04-25 12:29:42 Even after 70 years we have not learnt how to insulate the country from high oil prices. We are the world's second largest importer. We need to roll back Excise duty to reduce the impact. We also need to examine price of petrol/diesel on the basis of the veh one drives.
5577 2018-04-25 12:29:10 I didn't miss anything, I chose not to address THAT point in my column. There are fair arguments pro and con for the honour, but Forbes' is ridiculous by any measure. "Hurt and devalued"? Seriously? Is this the oil patch or an Iron John drumming circle?

5870 2018-04-25 11:48:23 Oil dips away from highs as rising US supply clouds bull-run
Brent crude oil futures were at $73.71 per barrel at down 0.2%

The period of oversupply that started in 2014 has now ended due to supply disruptions and also strong demand.
5871 2018-04-25 11:48:11 You’re are blaming the oil companies for false narratives I could state the same about those anti oil profiteers like Al Gore. Or those selling windmills or other green technologies. Shore lines are disappearing because of erosion not rising water. Most predictions have failed.

They wait for oil money every month from the south. Buhari and his people in the north are too lazy. Nigeria cannot move forward because of them

It's a threat by an industry struggling to hold on to it's power and influence in a time when people are saying we need change
5895 2018-04-25 11:44:08 Yeah sure, if he let's oil companies out of this "costly" requirement, you can bet gas prices won't fall. It'll be just more bigly profits for greedy oil companies

You put water in this device, maybe a few drops of good smelling oil, and connect it over a cable with stream. Then it’s heating up and steam is leaving the container with a light smell of the oil

5995 2018-04-25 11:29:32 you probably can, BUT it won't taste that chocolatey. The dark chocolate is diluted a fair bit in the buttercream. Also (using milk choc) you'll be getting things like vegetable oil and other crap which could affect the consistency for piping. hope that helps

6037 2018-04-25 11:23:11 @VicenteFoxQue knows it,the amount of money mexicans send to mexico yearly is comparable to oil profits in the country.
Ilegals happy to send what they earn and don't use cuz America provides for them.
Last year 2300 m dollars sent to Mexico.

It’s as if the unionists see oil as a burden. It’s really not, it’s kept the uk afloat for decades.

6088 2018-04-25 11:16:32 Yes, not as much processing to extract the oil (cold pressed). Just have to be careful when offered “olive oil blends” and such.

6199 2018-04-25 10:52:38 Incorrect, Paul. There's only two thing you can be completely, take-to-the-bank sure about in climate science; climate change is happening and we caused it by burning fossil fuels. Lies do indeed kill, but lying for profit as oil & coal companies do is truly reprehensible.

That's how every body else likes it....ugh.....

6433 2018-04-25 10:04:33   #Oil prices were stable but were below the more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market.
6434 2018-04-25 10:04:04 Hi Steve. Numerous factors at play but mostly large mega projects prove more complicated and hard to do than originally envisaged. the track record of all oil and gas mega projects (over 1 billion barrels) - not just lng - show similar delays on average dating back 20 years.
6435 2018-04-25 10:03:48 There are always rising fuel prices even when the price of a barrel of oil falling

6565 2018-04-25 09:32:43 #CILIPCopy18 However, oil is a finite resource and data is better when it is reused, combined and shared - finding new solutions, better targeted uses and new innovation. The value of data can be unlocked by sharing, not holding on to it as you would with traditional assets.

6588 2018-04-25 09:28:46 #CILIPCopy18 Is data the new oil? Data needs extracting and processing, we are always finding new uses for it, it creates new industries and jobs, has a huge social impact. Over time we have noticed that the few large companies - Amazon, Facebook, Google - have too much power.
6589 2018-04-25 09:28:35 So it takes 15 people in the renewable industry to supply the same energy as 2 people in oil and gas? That explains the huge increase in cost for “green” energy. No thanks.

6833 2018-04-25 08:39:10 They begun pouring soil and concrete somewhere around 2012. I knew trouble wouldn't be far off. Now, the run off from Banda, Kyambogo has no flow. THEN they built City Oil and someone is building behind it. Further ensuring no flow out. Wawu, Ugandans are extremely bright...

7233 2018-04-25 07:16:19 Crude oil prices shot up 24% in the first 3 months & touched a 40 month high in April 2018 owing to decline in global inventories driven by production cuts by the OPEC & geopolitical tensions.

7374 2018-04-25 06:47:00 It can be read in different way too: if the rates go up.... the number of oil projects you can bring on stream are lower.... therefore.... you tend to reduce the supply. By reducing supply you bring up the oil prices.

sneak in. If you want to go “green“, try peppermint oil. Mice hate the smell. Soak cotton balls to repel them and where you think they could be coming in from.
7624 2018-04-25 05:59:39 Energy East would also be an export pipeline. Europe is a massive diesel market.  Heavy oil (like bitumen) produced more diesel than light oil.  We could displace Saudi and Russian oil in Europe, particularly in Poland and Ukraine. New Brunswick is closer to Europe than Houston
7625 2018-04-25 05:58:50 Operation Ajax, the name by which the sordid plan to undermine and topple  Mossadeq’s government is known, response to Mossadeq’s decision to nationalize Iran’s oil with a view to husbanding revenue for the benefit of the Iranian people RT

7632 2018-04-25 05:56:56 Equatorial Guinea is clearly an outlier due to oil discovery. So why is Botswana the only successful African country?

7641 2018-04-25 05:54:49 How about electric ferry’s? How do you intend to get supplies to the people up north in winter when it’s -40? Think an electric truck or car is gonna help? What are  Suzuki, Elizabeth may and climate Barbie going to fly their private planes around? You will always need oil.
7642 2018-04-25 05:54:29 ヴォンボさんのとこのタチャンカしてるアマデ氏好きなんだよな……
7643 2018-04-25 05:54:26 You have it just backwards.  Without SA and OPEC accepting payment for oil in dollars from other countries, the USA doesn't survive.  Demand for dollars plumment.  The dollar is supported by oil. The Petrodollar is the key to understanding the geopolitics of the Middle East.

7647 2018-04-25 05:53:44 Plus a pipeline causes less harm to the environment than a bunch of trucks transporting oil from Alberta to BC!
7648 2018-04-25 05:53:43 Accidentally bought a shampoo with menthol oil in it, so now every time I shower, my scalp, beard, armpits and privates have this minty cool sensation. I don't like this at all, but I'm too stingy to throw it out xD
7649 2018-04-25 05:53:43 In fact the origins of the 1970s malaise were in cost push inflation and the OPEC oil crisis i. 1973. Union reform was required but was achieved in other more sucessful countries through concilliation and within the Keynsian framework.

7653 2018-04-25 05:52:45 Exactly.  Routine stuff like pap smears, PSA tests, cholesterol, A1C, and mammograms should have the prices posted on street corners like oil changes.
7654 2018-04-25 05:52:24 But if I can get this oil rig job then I will be a happy boy
7655 2018-04-25 05:52:21 Please explain when your plants cannot work without gas & you cannot survive without gas then WHY we pay fuel adjustment charges and units on the basis of furnace oil/diesel ??

"Yea"
Not only could CBD be an avenue 2 the legalization of marijuana but it's probably the best pathway 4 cannabis 2 become decriminalized and/or legalized.
Stop 4 a moment & really think about it.
It's common sense!

7699 2018-04-25 05:40:42 " voted against a resolution to make ‘Canadian oil and gas independence’ an official policy." and "want no part of oil-gas independence for nation" are two different things. Slick and tricky how you make them sound like the same position.

7710 2018-04-25 05:38:34  Oil prices fell back from more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market.

It was truly dank.
7712 2018-04-25 05:38:10 There could be a high probability of interest rate hike before next bi-monthly monetary policy. If crude oil prices continue to rise and touch 80$ then we may expect an action from RBI soon.

I know the bastard personally, along with some of the Tx mafia.

The invasion was about oil, reconstruction, Houston & Texas and profiteering.

Bad & irresponsible

I hope you don't notice.


7717 2018-04-25 05:37:27 Early stroll. A black slug like a daub of oil paint on the pavement. A pigeon splashes from a bush and flaps across the air beside my face. A truck full of doors passes: all those dramatic slammings and walkings-out. That leg of the sky is wearing a rainbow sock.
7718 2018-04-25 05:37:08 The country’s oil, food and transport import bill rose nearly 11% YoY to USD23.43bn in the first nine months of FY18, owing to an increase in global prices of crude and grains

7720 2018-04-25 05:36:44 Young man 25m in one day selling oil.....was a stretch. He said 3000 were pre-ordered before the sale day....hence she only sold 2000 on  that day. More plausible is she made 25m within the period of the pre-order and the sale day.

7723 2018-04-25 05:35:44 Whole Foods. Good ratios between protein(chicken, turkey, fish etc) carbs(rice, potatoes, fruit), and fat(olive oil, avocado, eggs, red meat) for meals. Eat small portions often. Weight training 3-5x a week so you can build a little muscle.

7732 2018-04-25 05:33:43 Couple of days back I questioned a hard core stupid Bjp & Modi bhakt about equation of rising petrol prices.. he disappeared.. Even he couldn't understand how come Crude oil price down by 50% still petrol prices going up... Haahhaaa.. Poor Feku Jumlendra bhakth's....
7733 2018-04-25 05:33:40 Come out here to the oil field
7734 2018-04-25 05:33:29 Literally: to sell oil
7735 2018-04-25 05:33:05 Doubtful that sanctions had anything to do with it.  First you nationalize the oil assets without paying for them, then the company techs all leave that you were depending on.  Also default on debt right and left and no one loans you money to buy parts.  Poof.
7736 2018-04-25 05:33:05 And it’s ok to drill off of Nova Scotia, but North Coast BC has a tanker ban, not to mention that there is a huge undeveloped oil deposit between the north end of Vancouver Island and the Charlottes

7739 2018-04-25 05:32:40 @sandygrains did you tweet about kajal vs kohl ?  A while ago I was lamenting the disappearance of Jai Kajal - it never left one looking like a raccoon .  I think the new formulations- himalaya, lakme, biotique, joven etc have a lot more of oil/wax or whatever.
7740 2018-04-25 05:32:23 We cut jobs simply because we cannot afford to employ more,
not because we are forced to cut jobs.
Mop your own floor and cut your own lawn.
Change a spark plug and drain the oil.
The list is endless..
7741 2018-04-25 05:32:06 Pipelines are more enviro than shipping oil by train or truck.  Pipelines are more enviro friendly than importing dirty oil from countries with poorer standards than Canada.  $100 million daily wasted because Canada can not get a world price for oil.  Yet we import oil ? Lol
7742 2018-04-25 05:31:56 Da Nada. Right now, I’ve got barely shoulder wavy that spends most days under a head cover, but until Dec 2016, it was waist length, curly & age 5-25 were all frizz, all the time. 

The first two weeks of low shampoo feel like oil hell. Then the dry scalp calms down.
7743 2018-04-25 05:31:54 Iran is bad because: 

1.) Iran has oil and gas. Lots and lots of both.
2.) Iran is a republic not a corporate monarchy.
7744 2018-04-25 05:31:40 nagpachange oil pero andito na sila sa bahay, pero hindi naman na change oil ung sasakyan, nag rob nalang daw silang dalawa
7745 2018-04-25 05:31:31 Ummm… oil. Ummm. Doesn’t Napisan cure everything?
7746 2018-04-25 05:31:07 It was  Olive oil that used a candlestick to break the wishbone
7747 2018-04-25 05:31:04 PCs left the province with very little in the Heritage Trust Fund. The oil and gas industry profited big time. But even now the gov. stuck subsidizing industry eg. orphan well program and the K-M pipeline that they want to pay for. Dumb and dumber. It's the way it is in Alberta.

7757 2018-04-25 05:29:03 For sure he is fantastic offensively but he would need the best defensive d man in the league playing with him as he doesn’t play D. It’s a risk the Oil just can’t afford to take. Bouchard is a no brainer if he’s there.
7758 2018-04-25 05:28:23 how do you pretend to be a mechanic when you just change oil
7759 2018-04-25 05:27:53 I make my own I found from this girl on YouTube. Coconut oil, sugar, and cinnamon. It plumps them just enough because of the cinnamon. The sugar scrubs all the dead skin. And the coconut oils moisturizes them.
7760 2018-04-25 05:27:24 There's nothing to connect and I never known a government to be able to stay within budget more like a hundred trillion in the Middle East all they have a sand and oil which is drying up but again for camels
7761 2018-04-25 05:27:05 My wife is trying it but think the grade of oil she’s taking is not that great. We got ours at Holland & Barrett. Obviously better grade oils out there that can help those with MS. We going to try oil from #CBDBrothers

7771 2018-04-25 05:26:01 On leCanard: Refineries make hundreds of different products from oil from light gases to grease. You could not build enough pipelines to carry each product thousands of miles to a market. You ship the oil and local markets refine.

7785 2018-04-25 05:22:43 With all due respect, I don't think Albertans can claim access to the BC coast as their "right." While it is not the town's fault that they rely so heavily on oil, it most certainly *is* the fault of decades of bad leadership in Alberta.

7788 2018-04-25 05:21:30 And if you think it's ok to ship oil by rail, take a good look at the rail cars shipping oil the next time a train rolls by. Then look into what actually goes into building a pipeline, and the guidelines that are followed by companies building them. Maybe it will wake you up.

7798 2018-04-25 05:20:22 Correct. And we do have refineries for our market. But you don't pump gasoline or propane or grease by dozens of little pipelines from our refineries across the continent to distant markets.  That's why we need pipelines carrying oil to markets where they refine locally. Simple.
7799 2018-04-25 05:20:21 Except, unfortunately, they use palm oil: a horrifying and atrocious product, the use of which slashes whole forests and leaves orangutan babies without mothers. Justins, delish food but please STOP USING PALM OIL.

7809 2018-04-25 05:18:53 Those numbers have nothing to do with the point of getting less bitumen shipped by rail and trucks. We produce more than can be shipped by pipeline. Pipelines are the safest, most reliable way to transport oil. Therefore more pipelines ease the burden on the rail system.

7925 2018-04-25 04:59:33 how would you take oil out of water if it’s “touching” does that make oil wet once you remove it if it can even be removed if something is wet that means the liquid that is on it can be removed

8038 2018-04-25 04:41:23 I heard that if you mix peppermint oil with a base oil like coconut oil, and put it on your neck around and on the spine area that it helps with migraines
8039 2018-04-25 04:41:21 you just proved my point so if oil is a liquid how in hell can a liquid (water) make another liquid (oil) wet
8040 2018-04-25 04:41:05 smelling like peppermint, rose water and jojoba oil.... SIR! LOL

8051 2018-04-25 04:39:03 What evidence or stats do you have to support that claim because I live in Texas the largest gas and oil producer in the USA and over 80% on average is imported oil that we refine here
8052 2018-04-25 04:38:55 I spent $50 on a non rechargeable dab pen that died on me with oil still half way full. Ive never been so mocked
8053 2018-04-25 04:38:51 Dr. Forbes' statement is a one-dimensional expression of Engineers in Alberta. They are involved in more than oil. Dr. Suzuki is against oil sands development, not Engineers. Rather, the statement shows Dr. Forbes is letting the department be held hostage by oil company donors.

8144 2018-04-25 04:24:05 oil is already a liquid itself a liquid can’t wet another liquid
8145 2018-04-25 04:24:03 #Oil prices on Wednesday fell back from more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market.

8147 2018-04-25 04:23:42 No Anna. Every person in middle class, poor, traders in rural areas, shop owners are impacted. From long term yes oil dependency can be reduced but now one does feel the pinch. The states should agree to put fuel in GST.

8160 2018-04-25 04:19:40 I love the fear mongering here. Big oil has been screwing Vancouver long before this dispute. I mean decades long. This is just an easy excuse to make more money for Texas.
8161 2018-04-25 04:19:22 Yeah, I didn't even reply anymore because can't go back & forth like that But yeah CBD oil has helped people with some things & the marijuana version (with THC in it) is the one that has helped the best with people who have cancer

8194 2018-04-25 04:14:44 Iran is 100% responsible for Yemen's civil war and low oil prices that pushed Saudi to flex its muscle in an overkill total war, and the west which provides Saudis with weapons and tactical support is in no way responsible. Logic not your strong suit.

8197 2018-04-25 04:14:36 Well, the issue is that Canada has (repeatedly) made commitments to reduce C emissions & oil sands represent ~30% of the national inventory & you can't keep expanding new leases while also having to reduce emissions. Something has to give.

8202 2018-04-25 04:14:03 This isn’t exactly a facial cleanser, but when you take your make up off, instead of using harsh washes use Baby oil ( helps with dry skin ) & use washes that aren’t for acne so it won’t dry out your skin.

Now it's time to really burn the midnight oil and turn up the volume. Search deep within & find that conviction in self and run with it like you stoled it (hehehe) and the wind will get you across the finish line!

8312 2018-04-25 03:58:01 I feel bad for hating essential oils and thinking they’re dumb because I do own an essential oil, but I don’t think it cures my hand tuberculosis or whatever, but it makes my dry shampoo smell like oranges which is nice sometimes.
8313 2018-04-25 03:57:41 I made a note to look into Rick Simpson. No, I've NOT hear about tainted cannabis causing men to feminize & vice versa. I know little about this besides what I learned when I did the CBD Oil show. I'm not a user of it but I'm an advocate of medical marijuana for those who need it

8315 2018-04-25 03:56:58 Oil falls away from late-2014 highs as rising U.S. supplies cloud bull-run: SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices on Wednesday fell back from more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market.
8316 2018-04-25 03:56:57 So, you're saying that there is a market for our oil, as defined by the characteristics of our bitumen or refined product, right?
8317 2018-04-25 03:56:54 Standard Chartered  also raised its 2019 price outlook by $13 with Brent oil seen averaging $75 a barrel and WTI $71.

8354 2018-04-25 03:51:14 The LOOP argument. The flaw here is the assumption different grades of oil are like different grades of gasoline. That's not so. Comparing light crude to heavy crude is like comparing diesel to high octane gasoline. 1//

8390 2018-04-25 03:46:20 I don’t cook with oil much beer days.  I eat my fats instead.  The other pack I par boiled in beer and then grilled.  They were so good!
8391 2018-04-25 03:46:20 I ran out of Olive Oil so I had to use Soy Sauce instead. It's nice to be cooking again.
8392 2018-04-25 03:46:17 Honestly. Canada needs to refine its own raw crude oil. This is absolutely insane to buy back out own product like this and robbing Canadians of their hard earned money. Also. BC peeps, repeat after me. PIPEEELINEEEEE

8458 2018-04-25 03:37:52 The answer to the "is there a market" is an unequivocal yes. The existing line is oversubscribed now and is so on a daily basis. And, overall, oil prices are rising.
8459 2018-04-25 03:37:52 Don't get me wrong, he's no "I was born in the U.S. and totally grew up in Chicago, and you can tell by the way I wear normal cool person clothes and don't talk like a robot" politician. 

I mean, we may have to oil his joints every once in a while, but at least he's OUR Mitt.
8460 2018-04-25 03:37:45 $YNDX ? $KSU ? $MGM ? oil all around?
8461 2018-04-25 03:37:38 I'm just trynna rub some baby oil on it. That's all  #lrt
8462 2018-04-25 03:37:36 There’s a random oil stain on one of my favorite shirts that won’t come out, you can say I’m not too happy rn
8463 2018-04-25 03:37:36 Truffle oil is very potent, it’s a mushroom, but it is it’s own flavor of goodness
8464 2018-04-25 03:37:35 Indonesia oil well fire kills 10 people, destroys houses
8465 2018-04-25 03:37:29 might be able to do some underwater welding at that amount. You can try working an oil rig for that amount of money.
8466 2018-04-25 03:37:26 Ohhhh especially nice and moisturized. I used coconut oil today and even hours later I was like ohhhhh smooth...
8467 2018-04-25 03:37:26 *shoots arrow hits bastion and oil gets on zenyenttas pants*
zenyetta: AAAAAAA my pantaloons
8468 2018-04-25 03:37:25 Strategically placed oil diffusers throughout the house >>>>>>>
8469 2018-04-25 03:37:06 How is this bullying?  Are Suzicki's attacks on the oil industry also bullying?  Use of a trigger word like "bullying" does not convey independent journalism.
8470 2018-04-25 03:36:51 If I check myself into Sundance whenever I leave I will give Sundance hell  I'm going to give them a bad ass review lol how tf that building goes from being a church to a boys and girls club to a fucking mental abuse hospital , y'all not right that place need some holy oil
8471 2018-04-25 03:36:49 Okey, jadi netijen dan kawan2 twitter yang budiman sekalian disini sudah ada yg pernah pakai Argan Oil?
8472 2018-04-25 03:36:45 He drank the wrong oil
8473 2018-04-25 03:36:40 The one's who get hurt the most over climate change are not rich. Which is majority, factories, oil pipeline go through areas where poor ppl and working poor live. Never heard of a Pipeline going through a neighborhood of gated communities !!
8474 2018-04-25 03:36:29 @SecretaryZinke is making mistakes in management of our public lands, parks, & monuments. Opening our treasures to industry via oil, gas, fracking, mining, & timber leases & wildlife hunts is not what the American people want. Preserve this instead of giving it away to industry.
8475 2018-04-25 03:36:26 Lmao if you wiped it clean after you took it out and put it back in then came out with no oil on it. Yes, put a bottle in to see if it changes
8476 2018-04-25 03:36:19 Texas opened a dispensary but its just for the medical oil.  But its a 1st step.  They want that tax money,  just have to battle all the God damn Baptist
8477 2018-04-25 03:36:16 A great big shout out and thank you to @chaddever for his greatly stimulating engagement with me over #SCOTUS Oil States v. Green Energy decision. Lots to think about. #patents #intellectualproperty
8478 2018-04-25 03:36:06 Ladies if you’re not using coconut oil wyd??????
8479 2018-04-25 03:35:49 Proud of #UAlberta and Pres Turpin for recognizing #DavidSuzuki with honorary degree. Big oil and their supporters can disagree but they shouldn't dictate. University degrees are not for sale to wealthy donors.

8492 2018-04-25 03:34:49 .@GuyCaronNPD: We now have a media report claiming that the process to approve #KinderMorgan was rigged, following lobbying from a Texas oil company. Was the prime minister aware that members of his govt pressured officials to produce a positive result for Kinder Morgan? #cdnpoli

8494 2018-04-25 03:34:30 I have to wash my pillow case like every week bc of how my oil gets on it from hair. It’s the only thing keeping me from clear skin. I just can’t win
8495 2018-04-25 03:34:16 After showers I got coconut oil, shea butter, Jamaican body oil EVERYWHERE lookin like im bout to slide out some shit 
8496 2018-04-25 03:33:51 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
8497 2018-04-25 03:33:34 Omg I use lemons on everything lol. Especially salads or fish. It’s taking some time to adjust to olive oil over butter tho, I love myself some butter, but I’m making the transition to clean eating slowly. Thanks!

8501 2018-04-25 03:33:18 Yeah, it varies. The one I get a "free" wash from after an oil change is staffed, while the one at he grocery store isn't. Nonstaffed washes usually have signs (both auto and manual wash)
8502 2018-04-25 03:33:13 Los despidos de Cargill, las suspenciones en Buyatti, la amenaza de cierre de refinería OIL y de IDM, el incendio de Dreyfus, los accidentes de Cofco, y ahora de Terminal 6, hacen necesario un plenario de delegados de base que discuta plan de lucha empezando por un #parogeneral

8508 2018-04-25 03:32:32 I haven't heard of it, and if I"m being 100% honest, I think if I had I'd have just dismissed it as snake oil.

8516 2018-04-25 03:31:24 Wtf does it mean when you check ur oil and the dip stick has a lot of oil on it but then you put it back in, take it back out, and check it again and then there’s NO oil on it? Do I have oil in there or not 
8517 2018-04-25 03:30:57 F'ed UP FACT O THE DAY::   If Trump drops out of the Iran deal, the demand for Russian oil will shoot up, helping ease the pain of sanctions against Russia significantly.
8518 2018-04-25 03:30:51 If you call a 1930's Ford pickup that's never had an oil change or a tune up. Hasn't started in 50 years and has no spark plugs wires because the rats ate them a fine tuned machine. Then yes. Yes it is.

8523 2018-04-25 03:29:59 Thank the lord the oil industry has brave people like you defending it, you’d think it would whither and die if it weren’t for noble souls such as yourself.
8524 2018-04-25 03:29:49 The majority of the autistic community does not want a cure for our natural neurological variation. While I am not opposed to CBD oil for many things, we do not need quack cures, many of which harm our community. #autisticacceptance #neurodiversity
8525 2018-04-25 03:29:40 I'm looking for something that kinda looks like an oil painting of me as the devil. I was gonna use it for an album cover
8526 2018-04-25 03:29:34 But, all the almond and coconut options I have seen contain palm oil, which is destroying rainforests and threatening extinction of orangutans. What other options are there for a ‘dairy’ to use in coffee, cereal?

8530 2018-04-25 03:29:25 No self-respecting female would buy such cheap-ass headphones and everyone knows guys bath-bombs are blue and are supposed to smell like motor oil.
8531 2018-04-25 03:29:23 eucalyptus, lavender, citrus, anything that’d be like an essential oil scent would be bomb
8532 2018-04-25 03:29:17 It's kept by exploiting Middle-Eastern countries of oil?
8533 2018-04-25 03:29:17 how come my stock in gas companies and my oil funds never seem to go up as much as gasoline does at the fucking pump?

8535 2018-04-25 03:29:00 So the CBD oil is helping me with my chronic pain but is also lubricating my slide into depressive self examination. These garlic fries are helping to counter that bit tho.

8545 2018-04-25 03:27:11 @BBCWorld Iran and other countries should be engaged and not challenged. WMD was a farce and destroyed many lives, likewise seems Trump the businessman wants to negotiate maybe Oil and Gas for his companies and not challenge iran? Simmer it down don't Trump the rhetoric
8546 2018-04-25 03:27:10 We pump and burn roughly 85 million barrels (42 gallons each) of oil each day and spew the waste of 27 billion pounds of of coal into the atmosphere. p. 23 #BlessedUnrest

8550 2018-04-25 03:26:55 Thanks for the question, @clintladd. As the market gets rid of winter-blend gasoline to make room for summer storage, we tend to see a seasonal rise in gas prices around this time every year. Market demands, competition and oil price are also factors.
8551 2018-04-25 03:26:43 I shaved so good, I had to rub my body down in baby oil

8568 2018-04-25 03:24:31 Can you suggest with current powers what ScotGov can do when pocket money cut by WM and oil revenue at $75 a barrel will go to pay for future Brexit economic chaos?
8569 2018-04-25 03:24:29 Ridiculous. Everyone knows oil prices are a Sevier County thing.

8578 2018-04-25 03:23:23 In my skincare routine, for some reason I always reach for my oil first. I like to lay my moisturizer on thick.. I feel like it applies, sits, and absorbs better when it blankets the oil
8579 2018-04-25 03:23:12 Also Trump is opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve ("the last great wilderness," North America's Serengetti) to oil drilling, a place I've also walked thru & one where I thought efforts to drill had been painfully & forever defeated. I was wrong.

Increased exice duty again and again that is why price is high now.

8697 2018-04-25 03:06:37 tea tree oil should be used topically on your breakout areas only not your whole face and should be used at night because it’s a strong anti bacteria agent. Use it every other night cause if you over use it it’s bad DONT FORGET to dilute it it’s strong

I would recommend at least spf30!!!! It will protect your skin a lot from the sun, even if you only stay indoors! ;; 

I also recommend a toner to help with oil control! Glowtonic by Pixi by Petra is good! Yes to Tomatoes is nice too!

8784 2018-04-25 02:55:02 @RealSportsHBO The golf analogy & bowling wasn’t about the length of the lane. It was regarding the amount of oil on the lane.

8785 2018-04-25 02:54:55 Oddly enough, the actual.Syrian people have said otherwise. While it is admitted Assad is not wonderful, they feel much safer with him keeping ISIS away. They also noted that the chem attack did not happen. Check who already is set to drill for oil in Syria....

8853 2018-04-25 02:45:26 Haha. Fair enough.
Can you find alternate work in time to pay the rent and keep food on the table?

The big issue, in my mind, is the fact that it’s to run next to an existing pipeline and if it isn’t built oil will be hauled by truck and train which is a much greater exposure.

9166 2018-04-25 01:58:45 YAY!  How many straws per month will that stop from ending up in landfill?  How much less oil do we need from the ground?  How about May 15 instead?
9167 2018-04-25 01:58:22 Yay okay! So long story short, filaments are waxy excess oil that tend to clog in your pores. Blackheads are all of that mixed with dirt and bacteria. Blackheads are visible and filaments tend to be lighter in color or almost invisible! Either way, you want them out.

9171 2018-04-25 01:57:25 As recently USA Britain France Zionists just formed another alliance to fight for Israel, this time the war will be against Iran and her allies in the region. If such a war erupted it will be bloody, costy and will burn the entire middle East and the oil rich Gulf.

9182 2018-04-25 01:56:12 Privatizes services is so much more expensive. It is not even close, I did some contracting on military bases and it is ridiculous what they were paying. Fuel( diesel ) was 2.20 at pump and govt. was  paying 4.00 per gallon. 5 gallons of oil was 35.00 and they were paying 125.00!

9234 2018-04-25 01:48:41 People are saying that now that oil prices are higher Saudi Arabia is back to the same mentality of not caring about the economy because oil prices are high. This article shows that this isn’t the case and KSA is taking systemic economic issues seriously.

9334 2018-04-25 01:36:17 .@RicAcuna what about increasing royalty revenues / oil production?

We shouldn’t rely on a sunset industry for core funding - it’s non-renewable.

9346 2018-04-25 01:34:11 Controlling oil absorption rate will help control some of that. Oil volume on lanes is already 3 times more than it used to be say 20 years ago. I don't see abralon pads being controlled.

9351 2018-04-25 01:32:15 This morning started with a tension headache. I found some doTerra Peppermint Essential Oil while I was at work and decided to rub it on my head/neck and drank some lime water...my headache disappeared. Lol when I tell you I’m about to invest in some essential oils and cut up! 
9352 2018-04-25 01:32:12 That part of the equation is straightforward & no one disagrees here. My question remains: is there a market for this oil in a world of increasing supply of more cheaply produced oil and decreasing demand? I've heard enough unfavourable answers to sow serious doubt in my mind.
9353 2018-04-25 01:32:02 Shout out to @QuickLane at Appel Ford in Brenham. I hate being his guy. I couldn’t help it. Showed up at 6:10 for oil change, new battery, and air filter. They got it done. Kudos.

In case of supporters of Big Coal & Big Oil, that's the entire humanity.
9438 2018-04-25 01:18:18 I'm at the dealership getting the oil changed on the car and I see this. Seriously? It's not even electric...
9439 2018-04-25 01:18:16 Answer:  Fiat currency, Aug 15 1971, Petro-dollar.  SA has the western powers by the jewels.  If SA stopped accepting payment for Oil in dollars and only dollars, we would wake up tomorrow and need to add several Zeros to every Federal Reserve Note.  Hyberbolic Inflation. Chaos.
9440 2018-04-25 01:18:11 Picked up some steak on the way home... That with some veggies in balsamic and olive oil tossed in my @LodgeCastIron 12in skillet on the other side of the grill.

9447 2018-04-25 01:17:11 ... a corolla will do 600k just by changing the oil, brakes and tires. Maybe a battery.
9448 2018-04-25 01:17:05 Toronto born and bred right here... Your videos are disgusting... The best part of this city is it's people. This guy will not change us, you will not change us... Find a different place to sell your snake oil

9451 2018-04-25 01:16:45 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for smoke balm, and put some aloe essential oil in my diffuser.

9455 2018-04-25 01:16:03 @davidhogg111 You all have done such a great job on gun reform, gotten the worlds attention. Is there anyway you all cud focus a little on the environment? Offshore drilling, rolling back safety regs on oil rigs, stealing land "85 miln acres" from Native's nat'l monuments.
9456 2018-04-25 01:15:49 Bad news is, I dont think this coconut oil is gonna save my skin from peeling. Good News is, This shine really shows that my abs are starting to come in nicely

9458 2018-04-25 01:15:33 Might be the biggest feel good propaganda event for a country since Olympics in Nazi Germany. Seriously, Saudi is religious state that stones to death and beheads people.

9466 2018-04-25 01:14:29 I can’t spend more than 20 minutes in there.  Gives me headaches.  Go straight to the wearhouse, pickup what you picked beforehand from the catalogue and finish your purchase.

9473 2018-04-25 01:12:24 I’m out in the oil fields when the sun comes up alone with the wild life, Deer,Turkey, Bob Cats, Mountain Lions, and the Damn Snakes!!! But I love it
9474 2018-04-25 01:12:22 Did I miss where everyone in alberta is against this?  Some that are I assume recognize the economic benefit of the oil industry.  I don't care for his anti alberta rhetoric, but I'm fine with UofA doing this think the timing is terrible though.

9478 2018-04-25 01:12:05 Cetaphil oil control is bomb!
9479 2018-04-25 01:11:39 Not the right time to be shorting oil or oil equities, as prices will likely surge in the coming weeks and months. I'm targeting the middle of 2019 for shorting certain oil equities.
9480 2018-04-25 01:11:30 Sipping on that grey goose and petroleum oil. 
9481 2018-04-25 01:11:20 Despite our massive amount of oil, Canada is facing the highest gas prices in a decade. A failure of leadership on an epic scale.

9490 2018-04-25 01:10:51 The state does not pay chocolate growers pennies per month. The state does not drill for oil. The state does not mine gold in other peoples lands. If the state is guilty as a facilitator of these actions, it is ultimately the ones who pay for them.

9492 2018-04-25 01:10:19 A higher oil price rises the cost of living. It’s a nightmare for those of us in the transportation industry. We feel the impact -instantly- at the pump; while income consistently lags expenses.

9500 2018-04-25 01:09:23 I do all I can to use as little fossil fuels as possible & I hope to see the day when they're history. No such thing as responsible extraction anywhere. Fossil fuels are like asbestos, only much worse. I won't stand for petrostates trying to keep the world in thrall to oil.

9504 2018-04-25 01:08:52 Learned how to change my oil today 
9505 2018-04-25 01:08:35 Nationalize the oil.  All resources for that matter.  We should get check every month from this giant companies that suck the resourced out of the ground and sell to other countries.  Why aren't we paying.25 cents/L, we have lots of oil.  Why do these fuckers get all the money?
9506 2018-04-25 01:08:31 I was thinking it must be time to bring the car in for an oil change... today I checked and I'm at 51% oil life. Hybrids are different.
9507 2018-04-25 01:08:24 I agree with the suggestions about elevating the head of your bed while you sleep. I have often seen people use blocks of wood to raise the head of the bed. Have you considered essential oil‘s?
9508 2018-04-25 01:08:08 I know trump IS a human anomaly. It is not normal to be a malignant narcissist.

9580 2018-04-25 01:00:06 I like that idea.  I'm lucky - my uncle owns a quick lube (changes oil in cars) business in town.  I use that address....though sometimes I've had to sit in his parking lot with a book for orders delayed until after closing time.  >__<

9582 2018-04-25 00:59:47 This is like when nobody told me about oil diffusers and let me smell unseasoned air
9583 2018-04-25 00:59:47 Those pictures are from two years ago the laws here in California just changed about 4 or 5 months ago and I did my patriotic Duty mr. president and I deserve from my people of the Standing Rock reservation to be herd oil pipelines
9584 2018-04-25 00:59:33 I suspect use of tar/oil for torches goes way back. And Greek fire? Anyway, we can certainly say *nearly* without.

9586 2018-04-25 00:59:23 'Add oil to unicorn horns' ok, lol
9587 2018-04-25 00:59:12 I get your supporters rely on oil industry but are u really pushing a petition to stop a university from recognizing an 82 y/o icon who's life has been devoted to educating people and protecting our planet?

9592 2018-04-25 00:58:13 @RachelNotley what is your government's response to the U of A intention to bestow an honourary degree on Suzuki?  It is a slap in the face to the entire oil patch.

9595 2018-04-25 00:57:55 The slavery is not tied to the US but to the #ArmsIndustry - all the #FreeTradeAgreements are dominated by inverstors in arms. Arms & #Oil. The #UN warns against war with #Syria and so does #China - stop and think #Macron!

She worked at a few specific pressure points between his shoulder blades before leaning down and pressing a kiss to the back of his neck.
9597 2018-04-25 00:57:18 Riddle me this Batman? Why are we sending US oil to Europe while we import oil here and are paying more for gasoline now? Everyday the price is different. Last week it was $2.35 a gallon. This week it is $2.50 a gallon! Why is or government more worried about the Russians?
9598 2018-04-25 00:57:02 For oil doesn't count Europeans make bunkers and military bases and more deep in the earth
9599 2018-04-25 00:56:51 I just poured a glass of vegetable oil instead of apple juice in case you're wondering how exhausted I am.

9601 2018-04-25 00:56:45 According to @ElizabethMay , this is the safety way to transport oil.
9602 2018-04-25 00:56:42 They're growing it here in toxic ground, spraying it with toxic chemicals then labeling it as medicine. My daughters oil comes from France
9603 2018-04-25 00:56:40 The only worse experience is going to Toys R Us. Thankfully, that's over.
9604 2018-04-25 00:56:21 I only think of pink batts and 4 people dead when I think of Midnight Oil. Australia was attacked, Darwin and Townsville. #BattleoftheCoralSea
9605 2018-04-25 00:56:19 Ah, you beat me to it ! Plus all that conditioning oil for his oh so manly leather vest lol
9606 2018-04-25 00:56:11 I might have put too much tea tree oil on and might have fucked it up a little though...
9607 2018-04-25 00:56:09 Wish I could remember what it was for you. It was a review on something and she just tossed that info in as she was doing her face bc she had just learned it as well. I always thought oil went on last because it’s heaviest. Im sure u could do either but it’s been working for me!

9611 2018-04-25 00:55:31 I usually get melatonin or fish oil
9612 2018-04-25 00:55:29 A spoonful of coconut oil a day helps with muscle building.
9613 2018-04-25 00:55:24 Suzuki also owns at least three million + dollar homes and half an island. Other half is owned by an oil refining company. He told scientists at an Australian conference that climate change deniers should be locked up. He was serious! Be really afraid of these lunatic leftists.
9614 2018-04-25 00:54:42 Oil prices up. Interest rates up. Republicans are serving their corporate overlords.
9615 2018-04-25 00:54:41 So lets see here -they (the admin) just gave oil & gas companies quite a few national parks to drill as well as  off shore drilling - yup this would  be their next step  to f up the planet vote them out
9616 2018-04-25 00:54:40 My head just be absorbing oil ...liiiikeeeeeee why am I having to oil my scalp every. single. day.

9619 2018-04-25 00:54:24 I guess I meant the coal would be more effective at the Protection part of the EPA.  He’s as bought & paid for by oil money as my state’s leaders, Tillis & Burr, are by the NRA.
9620 2018-04-25 00:54:14 But does that oil separate?
9621 2018-04-25 00:53:53 I use that Aztec clay for a mask every now and then, but yeah that almond oil is my moisturizer or cream sub. Gotta find what works for you
9622 2018-04-25 00:53:51 I tagged you in an article where it links Suzuki & oil company co owning an island!

9624 2018-04-25 00:53:34 Actually it’s known that your routine should start with the thinnest consistency and end your routine with the thickest consistency. So oil should be before moisturizer! But take it w a grain of salt sis! 
9625 2018-04-25 00:53:29 The sound of it hitting the oil is the sound the angels make when they climax
9626 2018-04-25 00:53:25 Where are you now? Bangkok or Yokohama ?
9627 2018-04-25 00:53:07 @realDonaldTrump what's up with all these gas prices going up? Thought we were gonna be less dependent on foreign oil and see cheaper prices? Damn cant hardley afford to go to work #HelpAmericaAtThePump #HellWithTheExxonSummerBlnd #MakeGasAffordableAgain

9630 2018-04-25 00:52:54 But we're not talking of a day are we? We're talking of four years. If they can preach to us about paying for a pipeline they can fork out cash for the disabled and seniors. Or is this about the oil industry being in charge of them all? @OilGasCanada Gutless, powerless, used.
9631 2018-04-25 00:52:51 Something in my head kicked off an interest in an oil company called Valero. The rabbit hole is too deep for me atm, but I think it might be very fascinating for someone that digs deeper than I can.@graceanna_darko
9632 2018-04-25 00:52:39 Uh, yeah, I knew it would be this way from day 1. The former A.G. of good old Okee..bought and paid for by the oil an gas industry? Where they don't give a shit about education, only the Richter Scale!
9633 2018-04-25 00:52:36 Wow thank u I just bought some razors and coconut oil, will report back!!!!!

9639 2018-04-25 00:52:09 I was really questioning y'all's life choices, not that I have anything against mayonnaise, but... then I remembered that mayo is like 90% oil and... now I think I need to try this.

9641 2018-04-25 00:51:43 Oil seals in the moisturizer
9642 2018-04-25 00:51:42 What about the integrity of every graduate engineer or geoscientist or environmentalist who made their bones and livelihood in the Alberta oil patch?  The same oil patch that has greased the existence of the U of A for decades.  I hope you lose every dime of alumni funding.
9643 2018-04-25 00:51:31 They were able to fix the coal fired power plants in a jiffy. They were able to get the money to the orphan well program at the AER stat. They were able to get Carbon tax billions to oil industry for "innovations" we pay for. Mighty slow on human rights issues that impact vul Ab
9644 2018-04-25 00:51:18 @EPAScottPruitt How much is your soul worth? It seems you've sold it to big oil. You are your science denying ilk can go to hell. FUCK YOU.
9645 2018-04-25 00:51:04 Knew Ed Mezvinsky, two term liberal snake.  Met snake oil Slick Willie. Rotten apples both of them. Hillary is the worst, screw the USA for more Clinton money.
9646 2018-04-25 00:51:01 Oil paints are my favorite but they’re so messy& so hard to work with but I’m determined to get good at working with it
9647 2018-04-25 00:50:57 Wales doesn't subsidise WM with oil, energy, food & agriculture.  We may have agreed on mutually beneficial actions, but it was ALWAYS going to be WM V SP because Scotland's resources are WM's lifeline. Without them, when they jump of that cliff there is NO lifeboat.
9648 2018-04-25 00:50:26 mate I flew to Vietnam with balsamic vinegar and olive oil in my hair from a sexual mishap with antipasto
9649 2018-04-25 00:50:26 Oil first, then moisturizer. I always thought the opposite but watched a nikkietutorials video one day and she says oil then moisturizer. That’s what I do now and it works like a dream.
9650 2018-04-25 00:50:22 I miss Sally's and Peppe's from my New Haven days!  Bring on the garlic, olive oil & clams!
9651 2018-04-25 00:50:09 & I’m drinking on that mud like a oil spill nigga
9652 2018-04-25 00:50:07 Should have asked them why the Arabs got the oil and the Irish the potatoes? Notwithstanding that the Irish had first choice.

9655 2018-04-25 00:49:55 I stopped listening to his music when he started spouting off after his tour of the oil sands. Even now, if his tunes are aired on the radio the channel is switched.
9656 2018-04-25 00:49:55 Thanks for the tip! I figured moisturizer would help seal in oil?
9657 2018-04-25 00:49:46 Yes peppermint oil is great especially if you have nerve damage.
9658 2018-04-25 00:49:44 Finish up with a pat of burts bees powder at night or for a few hours and if you oil or lotion there only use Shea or all natural things to moisturize when done.
9659 2018-04-25 00:49:35 what I learned in Third World Development: white ppl fucked us and cont to fuck us over. Also America shuts down a lot of agricultural based ventures. I can't say coconut oil in my classes, it's like playing the kill bill siren. ain't nobody letting the coconut oil go
9660 2018-04-25 00:49:30 ครั้งนี้ถือว่าบ้านเราฟาดเคราะห์เนาะ ดีแล้ว ที่ไม่มีใครเป็นอะไร อีกนิดมันจะผ่านไปเนาะตาเนาะ
9661 2018-04-25 00:49:28 So oil would help seal in moisturizer? Or does moisturizer seal in oil?

9666 2018-04-25 00:48:32 I’m not sure! I’m reading mixed comments- some girls say moisturizer can’t penetrate through oil, but I thought moisturizer last helps seal in oil?

9677 2018-04-25 00:47:04 Every time I see this commercial with the asshole dumping olive oil all over his grilling food I want to reach through the screen and throttle him.
9678 2018-04-25 00:47:04 Citronella oil. not sure how you would use it in outside environs but it is probably safer than using mothballs.
9679 2018-04-25 00:47:04 Chef Gusteau cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with toothpaste.

9686 2018-04-25 00:46:43 Should we not do both though...??
Oil is today’s very real source of energy. We should extract it in the most responsible manner AND research into tomorrow’s cleaner sources of energy. The only thing we can’t do is NOTHING.
9687 2018-04-25 00:46:43 When they're paid by oil industry?

We don't see any development work done by u
9701 2018-04-25 00:44:27 It's very hard to take someone who spent years protesting the oil sands seriously on this issue.
9702 2018-04-25 00:44:27 Oil????????? Now that's FAKE news!!!! Stop drinking the CNN fake Kool-Aid

9709 2018-04-25 00:43:30 Where can I get the oil ?
9710 2018-04-25 00:43:26 The reality is that if the oil companies decided to stop shipping/refining gasoline to markets hostile to their existence (esp prevalent here in CA) then those sate's economies would collapse virtually overnight.
9711 2018-04-25 00:43:25 I use my Yeti cooler to drain the oil from my boat
9712 2018-04-25 00:43:21 Do it moisturizer and then oil. moisturizer typically can’t penetrate through the layer of oil but oil can penetrate through the moisturizer. that way you’ll get better benefits and healthier glow
9713 2018-04-25 00:43:18 @tae_thuqqin u should fill the whole bathroom with cups of water and some oil and super glue the toilet seat and giver her mirlax 
9714 2018-04-25 00:43:13 @UAlberta Bad call Dr Turpin, how many of your admin or faculty have direct ties to the Canadian International Council, a Pierre Trudeau & George Soros financed organization?

9715 2018-04-25 00:43:11 I guess you enjoy good pasport or visa from rich sponsors of another regime change project, this time for Syrian oil,gas,water, land, Golan and regional power? You have problem with vision? Need to see the eye doctor Dr Assad?
9716 2018-04-25 00:42:19 And it's $3.06/GALLON in Seattle bc Alberta is forced to sell oil & gas  to the US at less than world market prices. Thank Trudeau, people!

9724 2018-04-25 00:41:00 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
9725 2018-04-25 00:41:00 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

Planting her knees either side of him she started at the small of his back, slowly pushing her hands up while applying a small amount of pressure.

9739 2018-04-25 00:39:32 Anything to make a buck, right?  The oil and gas industry needs to be kicked in the head.
9740 2018-04-25 00:39:23 Reporting the news is a means of accumulating capital, and the cash flow increases when they ramp up the drama. 
I think it's telling that Reuters tried making money from oil drilling in Persia before focusing on the news, as that was easier.

9745 2018-04-25 00:38:50 The year is 2018. The oil industry has collapsed. Chaos has ensued. Zoom in on David Suzuki holding his honorary degree from U of A.

This was the culprit. The piece of paper that single handedly took down the oil industry.

ALBERTA THIS IS WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE. WHAT IS HAPPENING
9746 2018-04-25 00:38:30 I bought coconut oil for the first time today and my head is currently slathered in it and like..... this bitch BETTER be soft as fuck because it feels HORRIBLE I hate being greasy 
9747 2018-04-25 00:38:26 I am grateful for fossil fuels. Oil created wealth and bettered the lives of many. Sad to see so many turn their backs on it

9753 2018-04-25 00:37:55 there is one thing that rings true here and it's that, IF given the choice of either, i would rather have my mental illness and keep my love and compassion for others rather than cast off my soul to become a snake oil huckster on the internet to make a buck off vulnerable people.
9754 2018-04-25 00:37:44 Bruhh this oil is something serious I’m finna get high again

9758 2018-04-25 00:37:04 This exhibitionist & liar has hoodwinked his supporters, do you think they are conscious enough to admit what trump really is, doesn't matter b/c I have a happy feeling that a blue wave is on the horizon & the charlatan will suffer sever side effects from his own snake oil

9776 2018-04-25 00:34:27 It's got NOTHING to do with oil, or "Muh petrodollar" or any of those other memes. Same thing people said about Iraq. Remember how gas was 20 cents a gallon after the Iraq invasion? Yeah, me neither. The answer is, ISRAEL.
9777 2018-04-25 00:34:23 MONEY/POWER/HYPOCRISY: Land = Money, Oil = Money, Taxes = Money. BC Blocked Pipeline = Power, SK Blocking Oil to BC = Power, Blocked Carbon Tax = Hipocracy

9792 2018-04-25 00:32:14 Leap to oil pipelines. 100% fully funded private $. Socialist govts have blocked every turn. #Alberta #bcpoli & Federal; goal is cause private enterprise to surrender. Go away. So GOV'T can claim to be saving jobs.

9808 2018-04-25 00:30:19 "One of the safer substances to transport by rail is raw bitumen from the oil sands, which in its undiluted state is the consistency of peanut butter and extremely difficult to ignite."

9824 2018-04-25 00:27:44 You just can't hear the response because you are coconut oil deficient.
9825 2018-04-25 00:27:36 When I cut mine off I layered it but if you’ve been straightening the non shaved side then I would cut it shorter, and when the shaved side grows out enough I would cut them the same length. But to grow my hair out i massaged my scalp with tea tree oil three times a week.
9826 2018-04-25 00:27:21 Yes and no. There are allot of issues when you live like this. Fuel oil, well, little plowing in winter. But the fall and summer are amaze balls!

9834 2018-04-25 00:26:36 Okay, who has an ingenious off-label use for a liter of rancid olive oil?
9835 2018-04-25 00:26:09 The Renewable Fuel Standard was put in place in part to cut America’s addiction to foreign oil. Allow sales of #ethanol blends above 15% year-round and stop issuing RFS hardship waivers. It will help with these “artificially very high” oil prices. #RFSWorks

9842 2018-04-25 00:24:52 If other companies in the oil and gas industry will be working at least somewhat close to yours, things will have been different in Nigeria and the world at large. 

You people keep the hope of an average Nigerian alive in our versities and the labour market. God bless you

9845 2018-04-25 00:24:05 Maybe it's time to put water cannons on the border and start using them Or we could dig a trench fill it with oil and light it, we need to protect our border any way we can Enough is enough time to fight back with or without the government. #BuildTheWall
9846 2018-04-25 00:23:39 But they don't have any oil money to bribe German politicians.

9849 2018-04-25 00:23:12 Stress can flare it. Tea tree oil on blemishes can dry them up.
9850 2018-04-25 00:23:08 coconut oil is a blessing

9853 2018-04-25 00:22:50 Turns out cold pressed oils (fat) from plants are really healthy. Probably more healthy than those potatoes. Frying in cold pressed oil, although pricey, health wise is fine. Good fats and cholesterol are good. Egg yolks, cold pressed oils, cacao butter.

9866 2018-04-25 00:20:13 Keep the squirrel oil on - no precaution is too great!
9867 2018-04-25 00:20:06 Oil will be around for the rest of your life and your kids life and so on, don’t shit yourself,
9868 2018-04-25 00:20:00 Me: Hi I want to renew my oil change prepay package.
ServiceGuy: You need a coupon.
M: I havent needed a coupon for the last 5 years, and been here 15.
S: You need the coupon in the mailer.
M: The mailer you dont send me?
S: Whats your address?
M: <>
S: That’s not what we have.
9869 2018-04-25 00:19:57 Two things in Bernard’s diagnostic. “low oil pressure” could cause:

Time slips
Prosopagnosia (Inability to recognize faces)

Seems that he is a most unreliable narrator. Cant be sure that any of his  POV happen when he thinks they do, or with the people we see. @westworldrewind
9870 2018-04-25 00:19:54 El norte fue de fibo a fibo. Lo reconoció. Ojo q mañana está EIA y viene flojela para el oil.
9871 2018-04-25 00:19:40 anong blush on mo?

9872 2018-04-25 00:19:35 Venezuela literally has the largest oil reserves in the world (and their GDP right now is actually much smaller than what shown here, it's below 300 billion already)
9873 2018-04-25 00:19:29 I've not done research on this, but the one that I took is made of safflower oil, too.
9874 2018-04-25 00:19:27 they are oil and water. paras cannot stop doing thing that piss them off and vice versa. I was cringing during that convo when she said she was basically facilitating the whole flip. this sucks, I don't want paras to be in trouble.
9875 2018-04-25 00:19:13 And oil n gas right?!

It's net zero ghg emissions by 2040 to have a ChAnCe of a livable world.
9876 2018-04-25 00:19:07 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
9877 2018-04-25 00:19:01 OiLちゃんおはよう
雨大粒過ぎ
9878 2018-04-25 00:19:00 The same Democrats wouldn't even come to the table for DACA, cause they hate Trump more. They don't care about illegals, minorities etc. They only care about LOOKING like they care while people buy their snake oil.
9879 2018-04-25 00:18:54 One day Americans might actually march for their original genocide against first nations people. The oil and gas rulers will let politicians know when its okay to proceed. #NoDAPL
9880 2018-04-25 00:18:46 But laina is lucky!!! Cause she doesn’t wax or laser she literally just shaves w coconut oil 
9881 2018-04-25 00:18:45 I want to remind you about Germany and France secretly buying oil from Saddam Hussein during the oil embargo while the rest of the world followed the rules. I served in Baghdad & Tikrit for 18 months
9882 2018-04-25 00:18:37 @BoogieBrown_ so my body lava came and I love it! As long as you use it sparingly you should be good. Nice dewy glow...The consistency of a body oil, which is why ppl say it's sticky...And it has a slight vanilla/cookie scent.
9883 2018-04-25 00:18:31 the smell of the sunday riley luna oil reminds me of this green tea cookie pastry thing i used to eat in china and it's making me real hungry rn......
9884 2018-04-25 00:18:29 what are empties when it comes to weed? ends? some almost empty fancy vape oil cartridges?
9885 2018-04-25 00:18:28 Literally vegetable sent from the heavens. I eat a whole squash like 2-3 times per week, it’s a problem. I usually roast it whole for like 45 Min at 400°, cut it, scoop out the inside guts, and then sauté with some butter/olive oil and s&p!
9886 2018-04-25 00:18:13 that wasn’t tea , that was an oil spill  lmaoo
9887 2018-04-25 00:17:57 The biggest flying roach I have seen in my life flew right inside my apt through the front door.

Landed on me and I jump up and stepped on it, slapped it with all my might!

I have a bruise that looks like a bite on my leg. Tea Tree oil & cream on it now.
9888 2018-04-25 00:17:56 It's a friend of mine, Don. He, his wife, and I are trying to get a plein air painting group started in Tehachapi. He paints in oil. I paint in watercolor.
9889 2018-04-25 00:17:49 Omg  but honestly I use a gentle exfoliating cleanser that is really good pore cleansing. Followed by some amazing moisturizer and occasionally I’ll do a skin safe non clogging oil type bc my skin gets super dry 
9890 2018-04-25 00:17:40 I just saw someone add five points to his MOCA when he stopped using CBD oil.
9891 2018-04-25 00:17:28 My 3 favorite ways to cook eggs: half-scrambled, fried sunny side up (plenty oil, high heat, crispy edges, half cooked yolk) and “en torta” (moderately beaten then poured in hot pan) with some onions or scallions. Preference depends on mood.
9892 2018-04-25 00:17:22 this tweet tells you had too much vegetable oil last night
9893 2018-04-25 00:17:20 i really hope this oil painting of seán turns out ok so i can actually give it to him lol
9894 2018-04-25 00:17:15 We're now the 2nd. Largest oil exporters (outside Russia) with what's going on in the Mideast are gas would be 4 or $5 right now if we were not self-sufficient
9895 2018-04-25 00:17:10 Gas  gauge likelihood if @realDonaldTrump to re-evaluate the fate of the Iran  nuclear deal. Crude oil futures fell 94 cents, or 1.37% to $67.70 a barrel
9896 2018-04-25 00:17:09 Tapi rupa nya hanya mampu tarik nafas lega sekejap ja.. bila teringat kena renew license, kena tukar oil filter lg, service keta. Mostly banyak kt ijou yg kukira lama terabai..

9898 2018-04-25 00:16:56 Have y'all tried peppermint oil for cramps? Oh buddy!
9899 2018-04-25 00:16:54 They taste amazing just...drenched in oil

9901 2018-04-25 00:16:51 It is due to the high density of oil rigs and operations in the area.

9903 2018-04-25 00:16:26 I live above this restaurant and almost everytime I come home it smells like straight fried food/oil outside 
9904 2018-04-25 00:16:25 Texas has 7 constants: football, guns, Baptist, oil, barbque, beer, & pride

9906 2018-04-25 00:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however – and who we are fighting for.
9907 2018-04-25 00:15:49 #ALDUBKeepInspiring
If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.
9908 2018-04-25 00:15:46 Buying fuel @Rs67. 10 crude oil 75$ what are you going to sell it at if crude reaches 115$ like in congress. I understand now how anti - people BJP is. @AmitShah @narendramodi_in @PMOIndia I wont vote for BJP.
9909 2018-04-25 00:15:31 GROUPON: here are 6 more locations that can do your oil change you just had done
9910 2018-04-25 00:15:27 Human error, rail tanker design, rail bed grade, etc. were all causes of the Lac-Mégantic disaster. If a train derailment occurs near a major river at a remote location it'll make no difference if it's Bakken or Alberta oil sands. #TransMountain #abpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
9911 2018-04-25 00:15:13 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
9912 2018-04-25 00:15:11 Every conspiracy theorist believes they've got "the good oil" that the others can't see.
9913 2018-04-25 00:15:07 Our new tgin Smooth & Hold Edge Control is infused with Vitamin E and castor oil.  This nutrient rich formula promotes hair growth and holds edges in place without building up and flaking. #naturalhair #tgin #tginatural #thankgodimnatural #thankgoditsnatural #tginedgecontrol
9914 2018-04-25 00:15:04 Good point. It’s not even far from the airport. Would’ve been handy during the oil boom days.
9915 2018-04-25 00:14:59 shallow to say the minority shouldnt have a say. perhaps montana wyoming and north dakota should put an intrastate tax on your energy and oil. when your states over inflat their budgets we will say no to utilities. we may be small wh house your wheat,barley, sugar cattle sheepoil
9916 2018-04-25 00:14:55 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
9917 2018-04-25 00:14:27 Do any of my Twitter friends know where in metro Detroit (preferably near Livonia) where I can purchase CBD oil? I've researched that it's great for Ulcerative Colitis. Thanks.

9919 2018-04-25 00:14:21 Putting peppermint oil in my diffuser has helped my allergies more than any medicine
9920 2018-04-25 00:14:16 The brothers had supplied me with a reddish oil with which I anointed my entire body and one of them cut my hair, which had grown quite long, in the prevailing fashion of the time, square at the back and banged in front, so that I could have passed anywhere upon
9921 2018-04-25 00:13:57 Oil pulling w/ coconut oil and it looks like i have a mouth full of nut .... but obviously it’s not because i have the strongest urge to spit right now .
9922 2018-04-25 00:13:24 So  lets see here -they (the admin) just gave oil & gas companies quite a few national parks to drill as well as the off shore drilling - yup this would  be their  next step  to f up the planet
9923 2018-04-25 00:13:22 Kenney and the UCP want a totalitarian system where only pro oil and gas academics and education is allowed. #ableg
9924 2018-04-25 00:13:15 It's a petroleum byproduct right? So big oil and all those screwballs make money. Plastic cannot be recycled - it can be up or downcycled. Did you know the ocean makes %70 of our oxygen, and it is making less oxygen...
9925 2018-04-25 00:12:58 bread + olive oil&balsamic is soooooo fuckin slept on
9926 2018-04-25 00:11:26 Cold pack on back of neck, dark room, lavender oil on back of neck and drink caffeine. My wife knows this stuff, not me.
9927 2018-04-25 00:10:50 Oil Rises right to the top exactly as deplorables do!! I guess you flunked science class too dumbass!!
9928 2018-04-25 00:10:44 i wonder if china’s flattening of oil demand over the past 18 months is statistically significant. 
9929 2018-04-25 00:10:42 Took vehicle in for oil change and inspection with an “everything is ok” a month or so ago. Now I get an email saying that I haven’t fixed the problem that was pointed out to me at the inspection. What The Heck?!?!?
9930 2018-04-25 00:10:37 Oil and water should just fuck already
9931 2018-04-25 00:10:28 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！

9937 2018-04-25 00:09:00 Perhaps, but it doesn't HAVE to. Let's legalize CBD oil first and IMMEDIATELY to help opioid addicts and others with chronic pain.

9940 2018-04-25 00:08:40 Ugh my best friend put baby oil on me, we were at Jones. Now I’m oily and I hate it.

9942 2018-04-25 00:08:25 3 hours for an oil change? You should have done it yourself. Half an hour.
9943 2018-04-25 00:08:18 Excuse me? This is a such a nightmare - well let see they (the admin) just gave oil & gas companies quite a few national parks to drill as well as the off shore drilling - yup this would  be their  next step  to f up the planet
9944 2018-04-25 00:08:17 Peppermint oil got my hair type A1 right now
9945 2018-04-25 00:08:08 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

9947 2018-04-25 00:07:46 If you’re taking a moral stance, you need to do better than veganism.

Lying, cheating, and stealing are all vegan. So is palm oil, for the record.

9950 2018-04-25 00:07:33 S/O to my sister for working at Nissan, I got an oil change for 20 bucks 
9951 2018-04-25 00:07:32 Our high gas prices are a joke! Money grabbing government. It’s BS. Oil is $60/barrel - when it was $150/barrel gas wasn’t even this high.
9952 2018-04-25 00:07:15 I got olive oil in my eye and now I’m blind.

9981 2018-04-25 00:03:35 Our govt? That’s sarcasm, I hope. They couldn’t run a lemonade stand let alone the oil industry. And unnecessary. Gas is just as cheap in the usa as moscow and they have not nationalized.
9982 2018-04-25 00:03:06 The resounding silence in the west has been bought by their arms deals, cheap oil and western complicity. But don’t for one moment think that it goes unnoticed by anybody. In time, the KSA will be made to repay their crimes a thousand times over…
