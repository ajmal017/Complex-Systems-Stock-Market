1 2018-06-11 23:57:11 Hey asshole! Stocks plummeted Thursday immediately after the Trump administration’s move to impose 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum to protect U.S. jobs in those industries.
2 2018-06-11 23:57:00 Moron, since January, stocks have stagnated after the big January drop and have not risen to that previous level for the past 5 months. This stagnation is the direct result of your policies and are indicative of a major correction of up to 27% say economists.

53 2018-06-11 23:34:34 Under Obama, the market increased 61% in 10 mos., so your 19 mos. is way behind; the last 5 mos., you're at approx. 1.2%. And who owns the most stocks? Oh, right, the investor class. But you're just riding the wave Obama created, since he had CAPABLE economic advisors
54 2018-06-11 23:34:04 my stocks have done up by $3000 since the election!
55 2018-06-11 23:33:14 For a short bit. Most stocks are owned by financial corps such as Vanguard and Fidelity. They say that 90-95% of stocks are owned by less than 100 people. So in theory yes they could send it screaming down but more average joes would buy and they don't like that.

64 2018-06-11 23:25:18 Look how many people were killed in Las Vegas! Bump stocks were used so he could kill the maximum amount of people in the shortest amount of time. I don’t think our ancestors had weapons like that in mind when they proposed the right to bear arms.
65 2018-06-11 23:23:33 I wish I understood markets better I truly do. Truth is my stocks took a dive in 08 like everyone’s and have been increasing steadily since then. It just seems really good right now for things in the world to be chaotic is what I’m saying. It’s unsettling. Fishy.
66 2018-06-11 23:23:21 So what, silly Dotard!  you need a lesson in economics. Here's some numbers for you. The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of all the stocks!

82 2018-06-11 23:08:58 Yes for sure $SHOP for instance has peaked and is collapsing soon. Let me clarify when I say long on a stock I mean long term for the year 2018. Every year I pick 6-7 stocks I invest in for the whole year, those are my picks. I target at least 60% returns on all the stocks I pick
83 2018-06-11 23:08:47 Many institutions can buy gold and if not they can buy gold mining stocks. When gold prices move up sharply, the mining stocks will perform very well.

109 2018-06-11 22:46:46 DJT was disgraceful what he didn’t do regarding gun control.  Still no stop on selling bump-stocks and no change on increasing age limit for buying guns.  All DJT was just cheap talk, because he is still in the NRA’s Pocket.

111 2018-06-11 22:45:05 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

117 2018-06-11 22:43:39 I just mean you should pick the BEST long term growth stocks that are candidates for a swing trade. Just use longer term option and make more per contract.
118 2018-06-11 22:42:59 Y'a des gens qui ont de l'expérience avec Limited Run Games ? Les stocks partent très vite ou pas ?
119 2018-06-11 22:40:39 No. Modifications are not sold to convert to full auto. It is illegal to sale conversion kits/parts. 

Bump stocks do not do that either. I would have no problem banning them as they are a waste of money anyway.
120 2018-06-11 22:38:46 The reason the market is so strong is because the top 20% own the stocks and they just got the windfall tax break so they invested knowing Trump would be totally self serving.
121 2018-06-11 22:38:33 Being in the market for some years the tax bonus did boost most stocks due to reinvestment and a boost to dividend disbursement. Less than 3% benefited ordinary Americans. Last, this "bonus" for normal America sunsets....unlike the dividends. This is barely noticeable in 401k's.

125 2018-06-11 22:34:54 Yeah well .... mine under Obummer sucked, now under Trump it is flying high ...  and I have the proof!!  My stocks have exploded!
126 2018-06-11 22:32:23 stock market for all the ppl? only 50% of people have any stocks.
respect? you mean laughing stock of the world and vilified in this country by more than 50% of Americans.
jobs not coming back - plants closing around the country.
get your facts straight.

131 2018-06-11 22:29:57 Trump is destroying our country one stone at a time. Gas and food prices are rising, Stocks and the dollar are falling.   #TariffsAreTaxes Anyone who loves this nations wants him out of office.
132 2018-06-11 22:29:28 Stocks are not influenced by you Pres. Trump. Most hateful ill-mannered non-reading non-prepared President in history.
133 2018-06-11 22:28:26 If $RH wasn't running on all cylinders right now, with stocks at record highs and 3%+ Q2 GDP, something would be very wrong.
134 2018-06-11 22:27:55 I remember when he said it. And no, I don’t believe he lied. Though it was reported days later legal council said the banning of bump stocks would take more than an EO. Moreover, if an EO was signed, a circuit court would likely block it as they have with many other EO’s.
135 2018-06-11 22:27:54 @William08697810 how u doing? You trade stocks?
136 2018-06-11 22:26:46 Just focus on Leaps with Canslim stocks.
137 2018-06-11 22:26:38 @StyLiS_Studios 
It would be a great addition if customisable stocks were added as part of the accessories/attachments.

138 2018-06-11 22:26:19 What a terrible time to invest all of my money in pancake stocks
139 2018-06-11 22:25:31 Stocks go up because they retain earnings, which causes an upward trend. The bell curve assumes zero trend aside from the implied risk-free rate. The cost of capital bit is gravy.
140 2018-06-11 22:25:30 @RunRig I'm a swingger, not a short. I love how everybody here that invest in penny stocks take criticism as short attempts. Cult-like.
141 2018-06-11 22:25:05 You never tweet when markets are down, but 90% of the country doesn't own stocks. Why do you lie about unemployment? Why do you repeat tweets...boring!
142 2018-06-11 22:23:37 Assume you would be good with universal background checks? Registering all your weapons & Omarion I’d bump stocks??is this reasonable.
143 2018-06-11 22:23:32 Because companies are buying their own stocks and reselling. That’s what the Trump tax cuts did for big business. We will pay, but big corporations will flourish. Until it collapses. And it’s coming.
144 2018-06-11 22:22:13 #cosmicChanges fixed a cash bug with stocks

That's the key..learning so much right now from my mentor @trickmitch1 trully blessed to have such a gr8 teacher and friend. Thanks bud.
146 2018-06-11 22:20:41 Why didn't your precious Obama ban bump stocks and raise the age?
147 2018-06-11 22:19:31 Wide variation based on the REIT security.  Most REITs are income stocks and provide little to no appreciation in stock price but must return at least 90% of earnings to shareholders.
148 2018-06-11 22:18:58 After a 14 something hour power cut, online to see Italian stocks went up over 3% last night. How absurd.

150 2018-06-11 22:18:35 Some of us can buy good stocks and some can buy retailers. 
151 2018-06-11 22:18:33 My right to use a well-established healing herb is being blocked by a tax-exempt corporation that owns billions of dollars of stocks in 13 LLC pharmaceutical companies.  They seriously need to lose their tax-exempt status.
152 2018-06-11 22:18:07 Just gotta jump in. That's what I did a year ago. Started combing for businesses I liked as well as the outstanding coin structures. Easy switch over from stocks just a lot more volatile ( a lot like penny stocks ) cool thing is its 24/7
153 2018-06-11 22:17:36 You really believe that? Corporations are keeping their money and buying back stocks. A very small fraction of corps gave small bonuses to their employees. Apple is only bringing back $285 billion of which $38 billion will be paid in taxes. The rest is going to Apple executives
154 2018-06-11 22:17:30 We need to wait a few months to see the effect of your tariffs. The economic outlook is poor. Sell stocks, buy bonds now.

 My stocks are doing great since he took office.
157 2018-06-11 22:16:10 All that corporate tax money buying up stocks while doubling the deficit.

160 2018-06-11 22:13:25 BAN BUMP STOCKS. Now.
161 2018-06-11 22:13:20 Investing penny stocks are not for the faint of heart. But if this is your hobby, then both Steven Boyd and Hal Mintz are probably yours to follow for playing biotech stocks. Their latest big winner is $TNDM, which can now offset at least 5 of their losers. #PennyStockInvesting
162 2018-06-11 22:11:45 Not everyone makes money in stocks. Most people are trying to buy a gallon of gasoline with that HUGE tax break we got.

164 2018-06-11 22:11:17 I think @realDonaldTrump is pandering to his buddies like Carl Icahn who are busy shorting stocks on insider info he's feeding them in advance of his proclamations. They probably give him a cut by overpaying for his property. Money laundering 101.

168 2018-06-11 22:10:16 The exact type of economy where $RH succeeds. Wealthy people have the $ for overpriced furniture. This is one of those stocks I wouldn’t outstay my welcome.
169 2018-06-11 22:10:09 Most of us don’t own stocks.
170 2018-06-11 22:10:04 Also a bunch of stocks went up because they saw a person who will let corporations fuck over people again.
171 2018-06-11 22:08:15 Kind of synonymous with when Inco and Falconbridge...if either one unions declared a strike...both stocks would go up in price because Nickel prices would immediately appreciate. Ironic that the threat of stopping production helps the bottom line in the mean time.

173 2018-06-11 22:07:52 Stockholders receives cash for stock owned.  Stockholders reinvest cash in other stocks.  Investment helps other companies with their capital expenditures which includes additional employees and expansions.  No, I’m not retarded.
174 2018-06-11 22:07:17 I was referring to the summit he went back on before calling it "back on", his position on bump stocks, the muslim ban that first wasn't a ban, then it was a ban.  U thought that trainwreck would negotiate in good faith?

177 2018-06-11 22:05:06 Bump stocks are banned in only 3 states. Trump didn't do that.
178 2018-06-11 22:04:04 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

186 2018-06-11 22:00:32 He isnt president and policies dont translate long term to unemployment or stocks, both react quickly. So you are thanking trump, but because you regard skin colors as a racist does...you thank Obama
187 2018-06-11 22:00:06 Comparing stocks to flows is useless because the year used to cut off GDP is arbitrary. If the earth circled the sun slower, GDPs would be higher.
188 2018-06-11 22:00:04 Smart. My employer stocks our bathrooms with mouthwash, too. One less thing to have in my desk
189 2018-06-11 21:59:48 Usually I would agree on most stocks, but fresh off the IPO, crazy growth, I have absolutely no idea when it will stop. Could hit $50 and never come below current levels. I have strong faith in $IQ so I'm just gonna add to my position on every dip.

5) He may also steal your gummy bears (hide your stocks, except for when you are on a diet!)
191 2018-06-11 21:57:38 The stock market is only a stable economic indicator for people who own a shitload of stocks or shared equity.

Job growth is meaningless when those jobs do not pay a living wage.

You are driving up the price of goods and services with your trade war.
192 2018-06-11 21:57:10 Many companies are...  what’s your point?  If stocks are going up, stop complaining about the 1% and buy stocks.
193 2018-06-11 21:56:54 New stock market highs ahead. Great job. Business investors are clearly marking stocks higher because of President Trumps prospective benefits to US biz. 

Even the Democrats will benefit from Trump's massive 401k gains !

195 2018-06-11 21:56:06 could you try to educate Adam feurstein on this basic point. He keeps making the same mistake of lumping SGMO with the CRISPR BUNCH OF STOCKS-
196 2018-06-11 21:56:03 And the majority of Americans do not own stocks, they aren't doing great.
197 2018-06-11 21:55:43 @Rob_D_Niro Hey Lunatic, check ur 401K and ur Stocks!! Thank Trump Later
198 2018-06-11 21:54:51 Lol, ill be putting it back into the economy amd creating more jobs. Your still listening to those people who failed you in the past? He has done more good than Obama or Bush combined. You were wrong then, we will see at the end of the year won't we. Records for stocks, jobs, ect
199 2018-06-11 21:54:39 Yeh I bet. We have stupid customs charges etc when things are sent from the US. The U.K. Ant hill should take out stocks and shares on Royal Mail for the fees we have to pay to receive a T-Shirt.

202 2018-06-11 21:49:48 Get a clue how the US government operates. The president doesn't have that power. Complain to Congress about banning bump stocks.
203 2018-06-11 21:49:06 fully automatic weapons are ones where rounds are continuously fired from one pull of the trigger so long as the gun is loaded and the trigger is held bump stocks are simply pieces of rubber that bounces the weapon against your shoulder causing you to pull the trigger faster

209 2018-06-11 21:45:24 $KTOV is the latest penny stock buys disclosed by Steven Boyd and Hal Mintz who purchased ADS from Kitov Pharm's offering at $2.5/ADS. Worth to mention both fund managers are most often seen buying shares from offerings of biotech penny stocks. #PennyStockInvesting.

2) are bump stocks illegal?

I believe the answer to both is "no".

222 2018-06-11 21:35:28 I guess the same reason Obama allowed bump-stocks and didn’t raise the purchase age to 21. You know who I’m talking about right? The man who had no problems using executive orders in 2016 to get the laws we have now. But don’t worry, this president will fix it soon.
223 2018-06-11 21:34:43 sad that you fail to see the difference between most of the stocks you mentioned and SGMO editing technique that the new study has no bearing on..and I have no skin in the game, educate yourself if you want to act like an expert

However, contrary to many, I do not simply ride trends.  I detest give back.  I trade the explosion moves within these trends and then get out.  It a grind when things are hot, but it works for me.
238 2018-06-11 21:30:52 Ask @rtrowe as its not something I follow actively. 
There's a pretty significant announcement coming soon re one of the stocks I mentioned, though
239 2018-06-11 21:30:41 First off, I suppose you are suggesting that our Presdient doesn't understand that...second, bump stocks, universal background checks ANYTHING as a starting point! I was hoping you'd respond favorably to Don's post; I suppose not. :(
240 2018-06-11 21:29:12 Just because it happened under Obama's Admin doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. This whole "Us vs. Them" mentality is so toxic. It makes me want to join the side opposite of the aggressor. It's disgusting & I haven't experienced that much "winning" under Trump (just stocks).
241 2018-06-11 21:29:03 So what happens to the driver, does he/she get told he/she’s a very naughty person and get fined/banned for a period which means absolutely nothing, or how about bringing back public stocks for 12 hours during the day where the public could throw rotten food at the scumbags!
242 2018-06-11 21:28:52 Makes sense. You also cannot buy stocks with your credit card.

252 2018-06-11 21:19:01 SP500 is up 4.9% YTD but only 39% of investors are currently bullish on US equities for the upcoming 6 months. Only 19% of individual investors were “bullish” on US stocks just 5 days before a bull market began in March 2009 that has now lasted 111 months up to the current day.

254 2018-06-11 21:17:52 With blood stocks of O Neg blood so low, I'd like to donate but just the thought makes me feel sick! Bit of a phobia. Can just manage blood test, but nearly faint. Pathetic! Apart from getting a grip, any suggestions of how I can overcome this? @GiveBloodNHS #GiveBlood
255 2018-06-11 21:17:19 those would be ups ground rates from the printer. if you order 2000 let's say, then it goes freight. freight is much cheaper for volume. could be $200 or so.

modern heavier paper stocks, well that increases shipping weight & cost. something comic folks don't think about usually.
256 2018-06-11 21:17:13 No more bump.stocks!  No more assault weapons!
257 2018-06-11 21:16:44 Job situation is based on employment rising way back, long before  bloke became president they were on the rise under @POTUS44. You know that because I’m sure you’ve seen all the graphs. Stocks were rising under @POTUS44 too. Too stupid to see the #Trump shafting #belucky
258 2018-06-11 21:15:45 once again, a twitter bio "expert" fails to distinguish between CRISPR stocks and SGMO which has a different editing technique that poses no "cancer raise" risk so far in its data and which has been approved for use in Europe
259 2018-06-11 21:10:51 And so people like Liz warren and the other leftist elites can gobble up all the real estate and stocks for profit? Yet the top 1% Dems claim trump is only out to help them? Um yea I’m sure the top1% are crying for the rest of us while they eat caviar we eat bread

262 2018-06-11 21:10:01 With stocks like $SFIX that have a large range in its base, where are you placing stop loss?
263 2018-06-11 21:09:20 Did not see any gains today, but was able to improve my position in multiple stocks that I expect will surge over the next 5-10 days. Saw lots of opportunity to trade on volatility, & wish I had the balls to jump on $TSLA and $CWH when I predicted they'd jump. Next time.

265 2018-06-11 21:08:50 Market feels very random right now, May was easy, now all of the oscillators say sell or wait.  Anyway, FWIW I go through the exact same cycle...wake up with 25 stocks none of which seem "special" anymore...go on selling spree to reset.

269 2018-06-11 21:05:24 So answer his follow-up. Does it take more than one? How many victims? Bump-stocks, by definition, are made to go around established law. I would think, by definition, they would be a priori illegal.
270 2018-06-11 21:04:59 War is a profitable enterprise. Think of everything armed forces need. 
Now figure which members of gov't own or have stocks in those American companies. From weapons. All the way down to flag makers.

351 2018-06-11 20:28:55 so true about checking your portfolio regularly. I was checking multiple times a day (and feeling angst) when I held a portfolio of 25 individual stocks, versus basically never checking now that I own two broad market index funds.

363 2018-06-11 20:20:33 The Dow is a leading indicator of the direction of the market. Of course not all stocks and market sectors are up...
364 2018-06-11 20:19:58 Treat your stocks like your real estate. If the value of your house goes down, do you panic and sell? No? Because you know the market will go back up. Don’t panic and sell when stocks take a dive.
365 2018-06-11 20:19:28 World stocks higher: Europe +.7%; US +.1%. Market fundamentals strong but political & trade war risk is not insubstantial. Volatility somewhat muted but will return with a vengeance if politics or trade go South. Important to separate short-term issues from  long-term positives.
366 2018-06-11 20:18:50 Stocks can be a good indicator (even if few own) if their performance is correlated to things that matter.

519 2018-06-11 18:51:15 So stocks are a long term game, but to get started here are a couple of my recommendations

Those are just some I have

549 2018-06-11 18:33:46 The part on buybacks in this story indicates that the author does not understand how markets allocate capital. The Insead study has grave flaws. How can one compare the returns of high-growth FAANG stocks with mature co’s paying dividends and buying backs stock.

637 2018-06-11 17:41:42 i would perform with Cirque du Soleil, who typically 30k-250k depending on the act and if i’d be a perform without arms, i’d definitely be valued more. along with those acts, i would invest in stocks, which could double or triple what i put in
638 2018-06-11 17:41:32 I use it to watch for buying and selling...The LAST THING I look at before pulling the trigger. Stocks don't always bounce @ bottom BB or fall at top. I use basic trendlines to buy/sell. Someone once said: If you buy in bottom 1/2 & sell in top 1/2 you will be just fine!

835 2018-06-11 16:04:25 Your stocks crashed in 2007/2008 & unemployment soared.  When the market soared & unemployment dropped after Obama was elected, all GOP pundits were trained to say "But what about debt & the people who stopped looking?"  

Spare me the "economic woes" BS.

836 2018-06-11 16:03:54 Isn't it normal though? Stocks will be added to a large cap index when their market cap increases and will be dropped when their market cap drops?

838 2018-06-11 16:03:21 One of my primary trading edges is my ability to quickly identify stocks that are moving fast and force-feeding money into those situations. Those that don't follow-through get cut quickly. This leaves me with my largest positions in potential winners and smallest in losers.

You are making money off this thru kickbacks, or profits thru stocks, or promise of a future high-paying corporation job. This won't benefit us, only corporations, as their actions in the past have shown

953 2018-06-11 15:11:37 Corporate tax rate cuts are meant to stimulate job growth. When the unemployment rate is low the tax cuts won’t stimulate. It will allow the companies to buy back their stocks, increasing their own profits.

955 2018-06-11 15:11:17 I respect the Second Amendment and believe in responsible gun ownership. This includes, universal background checks, closing gun show loopholes on “no questions asked” transaction, banning bump stocks and keeping guns away from domestic abusers.
956 2018-06-11 15:11:03 If you don’t know what’s important with stocks, how do you know whether an index fund or active fund manager makes sense? How? There is no excuse for professionals not to know about individual stock selection. The skill set is far-reaching across any practice. Keep learning!

1144 2018-06-11 13:45:53 I don’t think the vast majority of liberals want to “ban guns”. Stricter gun laws can be things like stricter background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and banning combat mods like bump stocks.

And I’d buy your Mexico argument if Chicago was closer to that border.

1254 2018-06-11 12:45:47 first 5 crypto years the meaning of dump was 50% at least as far as I can remember, now a measily 20% is enough to get everyone panic. Fuckn Stocks Shitsheet should be sorted out by the way.

1279 2018-06-11 12:21:50 It's not. If you buy stock in a company that's failing, that's it. If one it even two stocks in your ETF are doing bad, you still have a chance to profit. How does the two compare?
1280 2018-06-11 12:20:44 Its a stock with very specific niche applications, lol. @NRA is impotent but if bump stocks are all you lose, consider that a draw. I know people griped real hard about keeping them, but feet never hit the ground.

1292 2018-06-11 12:15:47 I'm with @ToneVays. Bitcoin correlates most closely with high risk assets like stocks, but even there the beta is rather low.

This is what makes it so attractive to traditional finance. An asset that is less susceptible to systemic risk can stabalize your entire portfolio.

1382 2018-06-11 10:49:33 in 1999 I paid 1,300 for Greek stocks, I exited at 1,750 and they went to 6,500 before tanking to 800

I gave my order to buy at 1,100, that said

my broker (whose mom went to college with mine) gave me the old "nothing done" treatment some three "limit up" days in a row
1383 2018-06-11 10:48:35 India is one of the poorest countries in world. In next few years it will be as developed as Europe/USA. Therefore interest rates here are moving to near zero as in Europe/USA.
Stock market gamblers scare common people to move their savings from banks to stocks telling such lies.
1384 2018-06-11 10:48:05 I use both, it depends how the set was. If it was a meaningless set (SDs, double or triple 2 stocks) I usually fistbump. If it was an intense set I'll go for the handshake (if i'm not ill)  because it shows that those games meant something for me.
1385 2018-06-11 10:44:00 I also can't see why people would bother. Why put your money in a three-month notice account with no say over how that money is invested, when you could buy stocks & shares or put it in a managed fund?

1509 2018-06-11 08:20:55 You can always invest in stocks! Crypto is slightly dangerous when it comes to keeping your money in one place for a while.

1734 2018-06-11 04:19:49 Just an FYI, the @NRA helped write the first gun control legislation in 1934. Then again in 1938. Again in 1968. Again in 1986. Again in 1994. They aren’t as pro-gun as you think they are. @DLoesch was against banning bump stocks until Chris Cox called for more regulation.

1792 2018-06-11 03:25:23 :@KyleKashuv— This is what made me cancel my membership to the @NRA. Their support of banning bump stocks was asinine and hypocritical beyond measure.

1905 2018-06-11 01:59:06 Over 90% of Americans want AR 15s and bump stocks banned and background checks. But Congress is being well paid to avoid those measures by one organization, while children are shot to death weekly. There are at least 3 (stronger) lobbies against single payer

1958 2018-06-11 01:04:11 Reality is; people are being laid off in record numbers, so called tax cuts are allowing companies to buy back stocks  to inflate stock valuation, therefore the CEO’s get this big performance package.

1960 2018-06-11 01:03:39 Remember price is nothing more than the consensus of value at that second in time. In order for that to change someone is selling down or someone buying up. Real movement occurs when someone is willing to pay a premium or sell at a discount... #stocks #trading

1967 2018-06-11 00:57:38 It's because it's artificially inflated by stock buybacks. So a few companies are pushing it way up, raising the others slightly just by dint of it being a "good" stocks day. Modest to minor gain for regular investors, huge gain for millionaires and billionaires

2006 2018-06-11 00:20:15 He is working for America. I have more money in my paycheck, stocks are up, jobs on every corner, and the individual mandate is gone. That's more than Obama did in 8 years. The only time I have ever been unemployed was under Obama. #Winning

2024 2018-06-11 00:05:53 Dow's down about 1000 pts since the all time high in January. What you notice most in the intervening period is high volatility.  Even so, only about 52% of the population owns stocks so a big chunk of people don't see any direct benefit.
2025 2018-06-11 00:04:46 Hostage?  He lowered your taxes.  He's creating American jobs that Obama said would never come back.  Stocks are at all time highs - good for your 401k & pension.  Unemployment is at historic low

Seems to me that Trump has freed the American people
