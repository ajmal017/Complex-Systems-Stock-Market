14 2018-06-12 23:58:40 Peddling snake oil “cures” is illegal and deserving of prosecution. You didn’t have scientific evidence that it cures so it was illegal, fair and square.
15 2018-06-12 23:58:29 Kinda feel like I’m part of a secret society now that I’ve burnt myself on hot oil making @johnlegend fried chicken wings from @chrissyteigen Cravings cookbook! #worthit
16 2018-06-12 23:58:16 the reality is that trump is being a shithead towards trudeau who is also a shithead and this means that everyone is gonna be like uwu don’t bully canada! while conveniently ignoring the huge issues that canada has such as trudeau trying to build an oil pipeline thru native lands

40 2018-06-12 23:57:35 Different set of rules. Mideast policy is owned by zillionaires who want to destroy or balkanize all of the countries surrounding Israel & are well invested in natural gas & oil. A win/win for them w/ every war. Luckily North Korea has no oil and aren't in the Middle East. 
41 2018-06-12 23:57:31 Flim-flam, Carnival Barker, Snake Oil Salesman, Game Show Host Donald J Trump is taking the show on the road again. Big Wooooo.

43 2018-06-12 23:56:43 Surely this single face mask will undo years of prioritizing work, school, and others’ emotional needs over skincare, she said, aggressively applying tea tree oil and finally listening to that podcast about how women shouldn’t expect themselves to have it all

48 2018-06-12 23:56:27 (Use more olive oil than you think, and get the meat nice and crispy). Great with a Greek salad or tabouleh, and tzadziki.

58 2018-06-12 23:54:17 The more I think about it .. the more I see a snake oil type sales approach.. Trump was making shit up as he went .. it reminded me of 1 call close sales technique..
59 2018-06-12 23:54:15 UK Gov't must ask New Age Energy to cancel the illegal oil deal they have signed with dictator and killer paul biya. Ambazonians will never allow the company to operate in Ambazonia
60 2018-06-12 23:54:07 If it creates competition for Comcast-NBC-Universal and Verizon then it had to be done because those two companies have become the Standard Oil of the 21st Century in each of their markets. Unless you start at the top and break them up you have to approve mega-corporations.
61 2018-06-12 23:54:04 Definitely Tablespoons, not teaspoons! 

My fav way to consume is this:

Take 1 diced onion, 1lb ground beef, 2-3Tbls baharat, 2 cloves garlic, salt & hot pepper, & brown together in skillet w/ olive oil. Add 1/2c. Toasted pine nuts, serve over hummus w/ chopped parsley & pita.

64 2018-06-12 23:53:14 The price of oil fell from over $90 to under $30 in the space of one year. 

Was it crippling to Canada's largest industry?  Sure felt like it. 

Was there government intervention or did industry just have to painfully adapt?
65 2018-06-12 23:53:13 Tea tree oil is normally pretty good for breakouts but I used it undiluted on two below the surface spots. I put it on for a while too and it severely scarred my skin
66 2018-06-12 23:53:13 Amazing evening with Kim, beautiful Korean karaoke dancers, much better than Stormy!! We are now buddies with Kim! Our new enemy as of now is officially #Canada, and that sneaky bastard @JustinTrudeau! We will impose SANCTIONS on Canada and get their oil for free!!

69 2018-06-12 23:52:47 So I went to the mechanic today to get my oil changed and he told me the rear brakes are almost completely different worn out and the engine filter is super clogged and he basically told me my car is a death trap on wheels and I should not be driving it loll
70 2018-06-12 23:52:44 Hopefully you learned from and listened to those farmers. #RFSworks and it can build markets for farmers and provide cleaner burning fuel options for consumers. But only if you do what’s right for the avg American and not Big Oil.
71 2018-06-12 23:52:29 the instructions on the box are more or less the best way to make it (for once), throw tons of minced garlic and ginger in it at the beginning. chili oil, fried shallots, and scallions at the end if you got em. good luck!!
72 2018-06-12 23:52:28 DeNiro is an actor. Acting requires great imagination. Imagination is the highest form of intelligence. Cynical race to the bottom manipulation, snake oil salesmanship, lying, cheating, and bullying, do not require great intelligence. Just ruthlessness and a lack of conscience.

74 2018-06-12 23:52:24 Waxing always reminds me of being tattooed. Start: bit of a sting. Middle: ooft, bit sore. End: Numb - this part of my body is dead to me. Coconut oil is bae.

It was free t…
77 2018-06-12 23:52:02 Any brand u are thinking of buying should have 2-3 ingredients MAX (CBD, oil, & flavor) this ensures no fillers that will dilute it. It’s expensive! you need 2 get your moneys worth. Feel free to send me pics of the back of potential brands you want to buy and I will let u know
78 2018-06-12 23:51:37 A new age snake oil salesman spouting new age and Native American word salad speech. Cretin killing the clueless. He really should be in jail. I’m guessing cult members won’t press charges against their “leader.”
79 2018-06-12 23:51:25 Nope. I like a guy that can raise his arms above shoulder level. Waving to crowds like the Queen doesn't impress me.
80 2018-06-12 23:51:12 Understand two things, 1st. If you play @_MAXWELL_ music when shr get out the shower & give her an oil rub down... 

2nd. YOU'RE WELCOME!

85 2018-06-12 23:50:48 I started craving panzanella so I made it and ate it. Homemade croutons from ciabatta bread, cherry tomatoes, torn up basil, mozzarella cheese, and olive oil (for croutons & as dressing). So good.
86 2018-06-12 23:50:11 27 Lucas Oil ASCS Drivers have drawn in at Devil's Bowl Speedway.
87 2018-06-12 23:50:08 To be honest this is not that bad. Seen much worst. Had MUCH worst. I am born and bred here in Scotland so have had my share of the wee bastards.  Not anymore....WHY you ask ? Answer - Buy yourself Avon Skin-so-Soft oil/spray. Smells nice and if used right gives you protection. X
88 2018-06-12 23:50:00 Am left thinking "So oil price increase by 30% and people expect nothing to happen to the petrol price?"

97 2018-06-12 23:49:02 I am pretty sure Google is spying on me. At work a coworker and I were talking about mineral oil PC builds. I get home and watch some YouTube and mineral oil pc build was on my suggestion videos...
98 2018-06-12 23:48:54 What brand do you have in mind. Did you check the ingredients to make sure there are NO fillers and only 2-3 ingredients MAX (CBD, Oil, and flavor) more than that will dilute it and it’s expensive so you want to get your moneys worth!
99 2018-06-12 23:48:45 Keep up this form of rhetoric, it’s easier than actually addressing the tough problems like parenting or locking schools down
100 2018-06-12 23:48:43 Thanks Sasha. I’m all about pens but I’ll check online for the oil. Thanks again
101 2018-06-12 23:48:42 Por que le gustaria?
102 2018-06-12 23:48:30 Maybe if Bum boy had the balls we would have East and West pipelines so we had markets to sell our oil and gas. Not stuck to sell to US at a discount. Who are the fools?
103 2018-06-12 23:48:28 You should check how much oil money goes to Ottawa hint ( equalization payments) and we sell unrefined crude to US at 30 cents on the dollar.. I won’t wait for your reply 
104 2018-06-12 23:48:27 Are you still investing in the Trans Mountain Sprinkler System? Want to chip in and compensate the people of Kamloops for their major oil spill?
105 2018-06-12 23:48:22 So everyone who sees this can judge me, but seriously head&shoulders!! I usually shed a lot and have oily scalp. Tried H&S —I will never go back to those fancy salon brands. I use the oil control kind-cheap, don’t shed as much, hair is soft! As a bonus; no drandruff;)

110 2018-06-12 23:47:18 3k oil change is for 20 yr old cars. demographic is irrelevant to modern car comparisons. The driver of a 3k oil change car likely has owned it 10-20 yrs and/or has zero payments, zero concerned over such nonsense in every day life and just doing things vs debating on twitter lol

113 2018-06-12 23:46:50 Could they protest the overuse of coconut oil? Too much coconut oil, and the manager's grip on the bullpen and defensive shifts might be affected.
114 2018-06-12 23:46:48 Lavender oil and coconut oil are good!
115 2018-06-12 23:46:41 Lol. A bunch of LWNJs in Canada getting ready to have their a$$es handed to them by Trump when he raises tariffs on their car & oil imports which represents ~25% of their imports to the US.
116 2018-06-12 23:46:40 And some of them, even some who sound crazy RN are scared and desperate in their own way b/c (shit material conditions + Trump) and might be persuadable if we can wean them off the snake oil #Resist grifters like MSNBC. Heavy lift but maybe. 3/3

Never, and I mean NEVER apply essential oils for muscle aches before teaching a fitness class.
The more I sweat the more it burned! 

At one point I almost jumped off the stage to go find cooking oil in the kitchen to dilute it!! 

Wow!!!!!! OW!!
119 2018-06-12 23:46:20 I have a car and NEED oil, you have a choice of which artists you support that’s not a great analogy stop ducking the question
120 2018-06-12 23:45:58 My dumbass used coconut oil as moisturizer a few minutes before going out... I was in the sun for hours.... I think I sautéed my skin...
121 2018-06-12 23:45:54 Iran did make a deal with us. North Korea is an ideological fanatics issue that wants to make a deal with us as much as Iran does. The difference is that Saudi who do business with Trump, don't like Iran; also Iran has oil and NK doesn't
122 2018-06-12 23:45:36 Stopped in and saw the guys Engine Specialties to see what happened to the #2jz out of the BMW .... and luckily it only damaged the oil pump drive the rest of the engine is looking all good..... we got off very lucky

126 2018-06-12 23:45:06 I do believe if there were massive oil reserves in North Korea this would have been resolved in the 50’s.
127 2018-06-12 23:45:01 Step right up and buy my snake oil while supplies last....
128 2018-06-12 23:45:00 A little late, but yes. Tomorrow will be fun. Can't wait to see how Jimboman words this in his tweets tomorrow.
129 2018-06-12 23:44:50 More lip service for domestic politics and points with Trump. Putin and his cronies love high oil prices — what else can Russia sell under sanctions.

133 2018-06-12 23:43:45 "I have cannabis medical oil that contains 30% THC,” he said. “You say it’s a dangerous drug, what will happen to me if I consume it?”

U know I sent that shit back like "pour it into a pan,put palm oil inside warm it then bring it back"
153 2018-06-12 23:41:34 So much for wanting to pay their fair share. 
A bad idea, but, even libs don't believe in what they preach.
154 2018-06-12 23:41:07 Yes, we can use consumption based accounting, and the customers can use production based accounting. That's win win. ;-) In reality our 'oil' sands produce high carbon fuels, and we can't get away from that.

166 2018-06-12 23:39:28 For those of my friends that use and tried CBD Oil, how has it changed your life? 

  
167 2018-06-12 23:39:16 I agree. We need the pipeline to get OUR RESOURCES to tidewater. AND we should stop shipping OUR OIL to USA. Let them find another source.
168 2018-06-12 23:39:15 Apparently one of my co-workers No-Showed for work today.

I know this because he just showed up half an hour ago to get his oil changed.

- green tea ( not really pms, but helps acne )
- a table spoon of coconut oil each day ( shortens and slows flow )

236 2018-06-12 23:27:53 @realDonaldTrump well Mr Trump..maybe Canada should stop letting you take our oil, gas and hydro! Why is it ok for you to insult so many other leaders, women, etc..and maybe you should grow a pair and stop threatening people...it's disgusting and tactless for a president to act
237 2018-06-12 23:27:43 totally agree there. oil (for fuel) would be obsolete with this technology
238 2018-06-12 23:27:32 “Secrets for success”? You mean expensive snake oil....
239 2018-06-12 23:27:12 Canada will return to being self sufficient  with our human talent, abundance of oil, gas, and other natural resources, and shift our trade to Europe and Asia. It is sad that it has come to this. But we can’t trust America now.
240 2018-06-12 23:27:03 Absolutely can save! A little coarse salt to rub off the rusty spots, then oil it up and heat like you would to season a new pan. It’s pretty hard to rust all the way through cast iron, so getting the rust off and greasing the spots will make it like new.
241 2018-06-12 23:27:02 oil change is reco every 5k miles. and each one takes ~30min. so 4 changes ie 2hours for 20k miles. another 3 hours for gas/break. Total 5 hours. lets say 10hours wth time for charging ? assuming a 400mi range (which its not) for 20k thats 50 stops. how long for full charge?$TSLA

263 2018-06-12 23:24:00 Actual destabilization of the country perhaps, but the idea is that South Korea -- and Korea in general, really -- wants reunification at some point, and as such this is a different case than just "welp let's just hijack these fuckers for oil tbh"

275 2018-06-12 23:21:32 Cars, produced in Canada, then bought with US dollars taking advantage of the exchange rate.  Sure. make them all there.  If you don't mind paying another $10,000 when you buy one.

Power,oil,cells,electronics,lumber, produce...need I go on? Produce them yourselves and pay triple
276 2018-06-12 23:21:30 I empty them as soon as we finish service. So it's still 180°. You have to do that by yourself. A pan on boiling water is different to a pan of boiling oil. But it's a strain.
277 2018-06-12 23:21:30 It is frustrating to see current State of Pak economy....where actually there are virtually no shortage of Gas,we have largest reserves of Oil & Gas but we are not deliberately digging for these minerals....our Ruppee sld not have devalued beyond $60 if economy properly managed

279 2018-06-12 23:21:17 Before i go cuss out the @LubeNGoAutoCare people i want y’all to know it’s not my fault, they broke my oil cap and tried to blame it on @MisterCarWash
280 2018-06-12 23:21:12 That's BS. They WANT to pay more, so they hire armies of tax attorneys/accountants to squeeze every deduction? 
Hollow lip service and virtue signalling
281 2018-06-12 23:20:57 super safe to use around pets. or even get on your skin (in small doses).

if you use this a lot for mosquitoes on your skin, add a little coconut oil. 

and of course shake before using it 
282 2018-06-12 23:20:56 It cuts down on head-ons maybe. Cars flip. People still drive and : do drugs. drink. crash oil trucks at Goldstream. talk on phones. People still party and pull out into traffic at Goldstream pk. Speed like they think they’re AJ Foyt on the Malahat. ..
283 2018-06-12 23:20:50 Hello, I am Dairy Tariff

I love Quebecois cheese and Quebecois cheese ONLY. 

You want to sell milk to BC? Think again, cheeto. We only drink 3 dollar Milk-2-Go's and we love it. 

Bernier died because he didn't like me. Canadians are committed 100% to milk priced like its oil.
284 2018-06-12 23:20:48 listening to 80s hard rock and furiously drawing orange and blue people with oil pastels ....... help me
285 2018-06-12 23:20:47 Keep de pink!  
I want de  stink!  
Keep de oil!

286 2018-06-12 23:20:26 The oil drums we get are 25 kilos. The fryer takes a full one and a bit. Cleaning it is Thursday job and that seems to fall to me at the moment. So they drain into a big pan on the floor that needs to be lifted to just above waist height
287 2018-06-12 23:20:14 Um, modern ICE with a good full synthetic oil would need ONE oil change. Just saying.
288 2018-06-12 23:20:10 う～～～～～～～～ん10000000000000000000点！
289 2018-06-12 23:20:00 I'm moisturizing my hair with coconut oil
290 2018-06-12 23:19:49 Well said - interesting to follow the loony #Resist #TheDemocrats !  They slander from morn till night.   Totally ignore carnage of the previous administration.  Bombing Libya to steal their oil, leaving citizens destitute.   And libtards think he was a hero.  What a fake.
291 2018-06-12 23:19:41 One of my favorite lines is "this fish has so much oil in it, America is trying to invade it!!"

293 2018-06-12 23:19:10 This is why we need pipelines to the ports. If he smashes on an oil tax Canada will fall in a recession. We elect leaders to look at the future. They just think with blinders on. Alternatives should have been in place 20 years ago.
294 2018-06-12 23:19:09 Hi Sweets! We recommend using a dense brush, not a sponge as that yanks the product off. We also recommend using an oil-based primer, we suggest our oil but any slip or silicone base will do! These suggestions are on the box and our site. You’ll love it once you try those!
295 2018-06-12 23:19:08 My nephew poured my hair growth oil inside of my facial wash. You guys don’t understand the level of done I am.

297 2018-06-12 23:19:00 I want a coconut oil full body rub down
298 2018-06-12 23:18:55 Ceren,  olive oil is.more calorie dense than a baked potato as you know. 9 calories v 4 calories per gram but fat in the diet does.not breakdown into sugars so does.not hardly raise blood sugars and is passed through the lymph system before entering the blood stream
299 2018-06-12 23:18:46 Peace at what cost Gabbard? What is Putin's role in this meeting? He has defied sanctions with oil sales and guest worker tickets. Why don't you back an investigation into what Putin promised Kim to give your Trump Tower buddy a cheap win?
300 2018-06-12 23:18:37 Yes! They are amazing. What oil are you diffusing in the video? Do you like the salt lamps?
301 2018-06-12 23:18:33 Why couldn't U.S . arrange similar talks with Iraqi and Libyan leaders to avoid unnecessary wars with killings of innocent civilians and destruction of those countries? N Korea probably don't have any Oil possessions even if they have weapons of mass destruction!!!
302 2018-06-12 23:18:28 「We’ll sign a long term contract with Iranian heavy oil as you requested. So please tell us the location.」

304 2018-06-12 23:18:22 At the Brooklyn Nine Nine quiz last night, not only did we have a sing along to "I want it that way" and shout "NINE NINE" a lot, but we also were graced with some stellar team names including "grease me with the Boyle oil"
305 2018-06-12 23:18:17 About 3%. Around $3,200 yr for just me.
Employer pays largest share which I would end up paying. 
Same goes for ppl with families who pay much more
306 2018-06-12 23:18:14 If y'all could see the note D'Eyesha sent with my lavender oil. I am on the FLOOR 
307 2018-06-12 23:18:02 I am sure she will do that when she has time bot. In the meantime I think you need an oil change on your rusty joints and work on acquiring a better translator so you can string together a coherent sentence.
308 2018-06-12 23:17:35 Leaking oil, blowing tires. And saves.
309 2018-06-12 23:17:34 “My ex just called and the only reason I answered was because I want him to pay for my oil change” 

-Cool lady at Walmart
310 2018-06-12 23:17:14 Shale dykes like this v rare in outcrop. But sand dykes more common. We now think most are driven by overpressure, fracturing the rock and then being filled with the mobilised sediment.

Some sand dykes in North Sea can be HUGE - kms! big enough to host commercial oil deposits.
311 2018-06-12 23:17:08 Anything's a bottle of oil if you're supply-side enough.
312 2018-06-12 23:16:56 I was supposed to get an oil change 4,000 miles ago I shouldn’t have a car
313 2018-06-12 23:16:49 I’m sorry I don’t understand 
What Tax money is helping ship oil to US?
314 2018-06-12 23:16:31 In addition to milk jugs and beverage bottles, remember to recycle plastic bottles from salad dressing, cooking oil and condiments; food jars from peanut butter and mayonnaise; bottles from shampoo, conditioner, laundry detergent, fabric softener and household cleaners.
315 2018-06-12 23:16:24 Don’t think people realise how amazing coconut oil really is. #coconutoil
316 2018-06-12 23:16:18 I'm still weirded out by that ride. By the time he got to ranting about peak oil and lasers on the moon and Mercedes Benz technology...SMH.
317 2018-06-12 23:16:10 Dear @PTIofficial
Please make some graphics or multi media content on PIA/Railways/Steel Mills Losses, 1 Trillion Circular debt, staggering amount of loans, Exports and FDI etc. 
All above are Worse in Noon era. Despite of the lowest Oil prices.

318 2018-06-12 23:16:09 So you would let him keep he's nukes just so he doesn't get legitimacy?  That's why the last 3 presidents failed. They gave him money, oil and he still built nukes. Trump gave him nothing and is the first to at least get him to table to talk. That's #Winning
319 2018-06-12 23:16:08 u ever so hungry that u eat like prepackaged sliced havarti cheese with cracked pepper and olive oil triscuits and it’s like (chef kiss) bone ape the tit
320 2018-06-12 23:16:02 The idea of a class reunion is basically obsolete at this point. Its all done over facebook. The rare people who don't have facebook are the one's I'd want to see since I have no idea what they're up to. Problem is, neither does anyone else and that includes contact information.
321 2018-06-12 23:15:55 You're asking a very myopic question, but I'll answer it. Simple, by adding millions of barrels of oil to the market, the emissions from that oil will far out weigh emissions from conventional railway logistics globally. Safer? Liberals imposed EIA on Transeast. Why?
322 2018-06-12 23:15:37 Every time we make pizza my wife takes a roll of paper towels to “clean off” the oil and grease and tbh I think we might get a divorce.

329 2018-06-12 23:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
330 2018-06-12 23:14:20 What's up with olive oil always betraying me. I can see the bottle emptying everytime I use it but I'm always surprised when I run out

338 2018-06-12 23:13:20 But it's a lucky thing is, squirrels carry an oil rag with the poet's name and the hashtag...
339 2018-06-12 23:13:09 I'm not an expert on how this would work, but it seems pretty simple. Stop drilling, stop buying Saudi oil, invest in renewable energy. Everyone with a job in the oil industry could be re-trained to work in renewables.

342 2018-06-12 23:12:29 China has the right idea about expanding solar, but I think they would be better off with solar roofs. Cars leak oil and cause damage, rooftops don't. The #innovation is there, but it could be better placed. #ECU4842
343 2018-06-12 23:12:24 Some dude legit just tried to buy an oil change with an EBT card. Lol
344 2018-06-12 23:12:18 i may have Fibromyalgia (waiting on my appt. for diagnosis) so it's mostly for chronic pain all over my body but especially the back.. also helps with my anxiety/depressive state. I realized i was becoming depressive when i started the oil, suddenly i was smiling & enjoying life
345 2018-06-12 23:12:16 Truth of the matter is in this day and age staying close with your friends is almost too easy. The internet and social media are flawed but theyve made lifelong friendships so less complicated. I skipped my 10 year reunion because everyone Id want to see I was still in touch with
346 2018-06-12 23:12:14 Why am I dressed like a park ranger getting an oil change? Lmao

349 2018-06-12 23:11:39 Sure they are. Theyer been at it for decades and are 90 percent of the way there. And without oil, they’d look a lot more like North Korea today. But I don’t think the summit moves the needle much for them or anyone else.
350 2018-06-12 23:11:37 Don’t look at shit else that doesn’t pertain to changing the oil.

396 2018-06-12 23:06:07 Maybe not but you would notice if we turned the taps off. You get more oil from us than you do from Saudi Arabia, and we don't even make you take a knee and kiss the ring every visit. Maybe that will change. 
397 2018-06-12 23:06:05 I’ve been using Milani for a while but it’s started to separate? Just oil comes out it’s gross

408 2018-06-12 23:04:58 @sandrafornow trump:  “we developed a really strong bond”. ???  Just like that!  No commn language, very little time together, memory lapse of horrendous human rights violations, condition of Otto Warmier? Snake oil salesman = trump
409 2018-06-12 23:04:56 I have trolled @peekaymila  sufficiently today. May we wake up tommorrow anew, with fresh oil and commitment to our camaraderie.

411 2018-06-12 23:04:47 I GOT OIL PAINTS UWU
412 2018-06-12 23:04:34 With The US and Canada having a falling out, how does that impact the American-owned Kinder Morgan pipeline?

Or all the oil that is currently transported from Canada to The US?...since we refine very little in Canada.

Someone can explain? Link to something that explains?
413 2018-06-12 23:04:08 My gas station gets things like this from the American Spirit company and we give them out for free. Go to your local Murphy USA, Murphy Oil or Murphy Express 
414 2018-06-12 23:03:57 Your soldiers are often cannon fodder for oil wars serving families whose children do not go to war. That was my point. I respect their sacrifice. I do not respect the reasons they are & were sacrificed.
415 2018-06-12 23:03:57 I bought myself an oil defuser yesterday... is this growing up..
416 2018-06-12 23:03:52 #AlbertaNDP #AlbertaElection2019 we have at the most just under a year before #Alberta goes to the polls to elect a govt that's not #NDP or #Liberal. The latest is May 31 2019 or earlier. We need a strong govt to get back on track with our oil and get the #pipelines rolling!
417 2018-06-12 23:03:42 Are you going to help by pushing unapologetically for bus and bike lanes? Signal priority for buses and trains? Building and preserving more affordable housing near transit? Ending oil drilling in the city? Reforming parking policies? Lower transit fares?
418 2018-06-12 23:03:40 Yes I'm in Paris, but sadly lacking an electric belt. Definitely worth exploring! "Quackery in the Colonies: Pseudoscience and Snake Oil in the Service of Empire" 
419 2018-06-12 23:03:38 OMG I forgot about olive oil!!!! I was thinking I needed something to uh... lubricate the pasta but obvi pesto & that kinda stuff is out. Olive oil is a SHOUT
420 2018-06-12 23:03:37 Don't forget to rub baby oil all over 
421 2018-06-12 23:03:36 @realDonaldTrump I guess we should sell our oil to Saudi and they can sell it to you probably a better profit margin in that manner of trading
422 2018-06-12 23:03:34 An anti-regulation Republican Republican in an oil and coal producing state, and Koch's back Democrat Heitkamp. Very definition of Feckless!
423 2018-06-12 23:03:24 Let's face it, the incumbents would be asking your details, your mother's aunties dogs nieces brothers half-sisters maiden name to get you access again.

Paul Gathecha Muhoho company, Petrokenya Oil Company Limited, made Sh68 million this year for supplying diesel to NYS.
427 2018-06-12 23:02:56 I wish my car told me when i needed an oil change instead of me having to check it myself

430 2018-06-12 23:02:11 Larry the odds the Trumper is overcoming with all the roadblocks and oil slicks places in his path is sensational!  Have ever seen anything like this before at any level???  I don’t think I have in all my years!!!
431 2018-06-12 23:01:58 oh i could feel edibles but if they are stronger as if it takes me at least 30mg to get a oil high. at 2ml or 10mg per day it somewhat helps with the pain but i don't get a high at that amount anymore
432 2018-06-12 23:01:52 Way late to the party, but I had leftover pastries filled with silverbeet, plus a cos salad with an obscene amount of evoo and salt, and then some leftover corn fritters with fried chilli oil and vegan kewpie. 
433 2018-06-12 23:01:47 I don't know anything about sweet chill sauce. But I know there are 20 brands of olive oil and 100 types of other oils you can bring home. You come in my house with nothing, I'm dragging you for being incompetent.
434 2018-06-12 23:01:25 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
435 2018-06-12 23:01:24 Last year they brought on a climate change denier ‘scientist’ and made him sound like a genius.  I looked up the guy and he happened to be on the payroll of an oil company.
436 2018-06-12 23:01:23 After carefully photographing and listing the item on my poshmark as “swatched once”, the person who bought it opened a case to complain that it didn’t look like the one in the store THAT HAS BEEN SWATCHED A HUNDRED TIMES AND HAS GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH FINGER OIL IN IT.
437 2018-06-12 23:01:17 They can do a lot if they want. If Muslim countries stop oil supplies to Europe it will be on its knees in few weeks but I think it’s better to resolve the issues amicable.

440 2018-06-12 23:01:04 It’s not like I’ve never cooked with mirin, sesame oil, or rice vinegar before, but thanks to @blueapron they’re now some of my favorite ingredients to work with

446 2018-06-12 23:00:26 Doing a shot of olive oil before a night of drinking will slow down how fast your body breaks down the alcohol so you will get less drunk drinking the same amount as someone else in the same amount of time.. #crazyshitspiesdo #illoutdrinkyou
447 2018-06-12 23:00:25 After my shower i lathered myself in coconut oil and it feels nice but now with the smell on my skin I’m making myself hungry smh
448 2018-06-12 23:00:20 Mexico will do what ever we tell them. The number two source of revenue for the entire country is money sent back from the US. That revenue is only slightly surpassed by oil. Their economy would collapse if we cut off that flow. So yes they will pay for it if told to.
449 2018-06-12 23:00:02 Listen to the neo-liberal capitalist fanboy,rich tories laugh at you gullible fools like you  Chavez nationalised oil companies & lifted millions out of proverty & in thee most scrutinised elections the people voted Madura back in. Despite economic sabotage

458 2018-06-12 22:59:02 Indonesia and Malaysia love us for our cooking oil needs - one company has started manufacturing but govt needs to give incentives/protection for mass level import substitution
459 2018-06-12 22:58:58 @realDonaldTrump USA has a a trade surplus of 333 million in dairy with Canada i say up the teriffs or find it somewhere else or Canada being one of the leading oil imports to USA
460 2018-06-12 22:58:48 Wait til the US puts tariffs on our Oil.   And we have no where else to ship it.
461 2018-06-12 22:58:47 then driving to practice , i drove and hit a manhole cover and it cracked the oil pan ,
462 2018-06-12 22:58:31 accidentally rubbed tea tree oil into my eye and i literally thought i was going to die and all my skin was going to fall off
463 2018-06-12 22:58:23 Yes I do
When Americans start going after other Americans based on their race and committed violence I have an issue with that.
I also have an issue with stealing native land for oil and destruction of fresh water sources
How many times have you been told you deserve to die?
464 2018-06-12 22:58:19 Cause they took oil coup money
465 2018-06-12 22:58:07 So all the oil money goes to Trump. If US had a moderate party they'd win.  Look at France.
466 2018-06-12 22:57:59 Trudeau’s government just approved an oil pipeline that will run through Native Indian lands.
Please.

470 2018-06-12 22:57:20 Neo-Gnostics. No inkling of blood & soil. They'll learn - the hard way. If there is any form of separation conventionally and/or nationally they'll have to wait outside until they get some more oil for their lamps.
471 2018-06-12 22:57:05 You can melt it and mix it with a carrier oil like olive that stays liquidy

475 2018-06-12 22:56:25 Yeah sex is cool but have you ever put on peppermint oil and had someone blow on it?
476 2018-06-12 22:56:15 my nail tech always massages my arms and my back for 30+ minutes with peppermint oil and I’ve watched her skip this step with white women I cried today after she did this for me she is the best

482 2018-06-12 22:55:02 Peter Hitchens: Tories are just a cold machine which runs on gallons of expensive snake oil. So it decided to attack Mr Corbyn personally. In fact, Corbyn, a principled and genuinely patriotic leader. On the hand, Theresa's Tories are as useful as a zombie on a broken bike.
483 2018-06-12 22:54:47 @ToyotaCanada wife dropped off her car for service at Markville Toyota and was told no shuttle ($80 oil change not good enough?) then she received a call saying they can't open her car hood and would cost $129/hr to diagnose, got home and we opened the hood without any issues
484 2018-06-12 22:54:45 you r VERY beautiful I would not like oil splashing on you
485 2018-06-12 22:54:45 I’ll just throw some stuff into hot oil and hope for the best!
486 2018-06-12 22:53:59 I do a bunch of tests on oil and gases. Some test require me to record data over time as it heats up.
487 2018-06-12 22:53:53 I know @jamieoliver loves his olive oil but I never thought he would put it on ice cream  #jamieoliver #QuickAndEasyFood

489 2018-06-12 22:53:43 Appeal to renewables. They are gaining in the market. Hopefully soon the robber oil barons will be sidelined. It's a new world, Gen X and millennials will call the shots soon, I can't wait!

491 2018-06-12 22:53:35 How little people understand stuff. There's oil and gas EVERWHERE. The point is whether it is economic to extract it at any particular price. But also (as importantly) what the environmental cost of that extraction would be. And then you decide whether to extract it or not.

510 2018-06-12 22:51:09 Terrorism? Are you talking to me about corporate terrorism in Nigeria, where Shell drills for oil? Corporate terrorist for uranium in Niger? Corporate terrorism against the little landowners with modified seeds and pesticides, destroying their way of life? What terrorism?

512 2018-06-12 22:50:56 I use mediation, prayer and lavender oil. I like lighting bug sleep app as it nature sounds like beach and forest. If I wake and put it on asleep in 10 min.

514 2018-06-12 22:50:51 Lovage is powerful: chew some and your mouth is on fire. Tastes great, though. Tonight I tried mashing it into a pesto with an anchovy and lots of olive oil. Smeared it (sparingly) on pizza dough and baked it. Delicious and not overpowering. I'll do it again as a drinks snack.

518 2018-06-12 22:50:17 bad news in oil for days now, no idea why its not trading below $64.  saudi's and russians upping production, EIA cutting global demand forecasts, a glut of shale oil in the midwest.  nada good going on in the oil patch right now

523 2018-06-12 22:49:27 @stephenlautens you see. Trump has product. Ontario will be left in the cold. When oil prices rise due to the new marine diesel Sulpher rules coming you dudes in Ontario will go out of business. Hard times coming in Ontario.

532 2018-06-12 22:48:09 make sure your primer compliments your foundation 

Whether oil or water, your primer and foundation should share the same base; otherwise, they will repel each other or just slide off your face, making it difficult to blend.

540 2018-06-12 22:47:16 My parents are almost 70 & they use CBD oil to manage their pain because their prescribed opiates make them sick. Before using it my mom could barely walk & my dad’s heart surgery left him in so much pain he couldn’t move. Now they’re back at it like they’re 20 years younger
541 2018-06-12 22:47:10 The infl gain is due to increased production, ie fuel $ increase due to increased production, roughly 1.7%.  Remember that prior we imported most of our oil/gas and we were relatively limited to wht othrs sold us as well as limited refinery production (still small)-less so now
542 2018-06-12 22:47:10 Chef Kawasaki cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with cheese.
543 2018-06-12 22:46:40 @StateLineNissan round 2 of service in the same day. Pretty sure my car shouldn’t drip oil on my driveway after and oil change. Forget to tighten something ? I guess I’ll find out in a bit.
544 2018-06-12 22:46:29 Having oily af skin and having to get your makeup done in like 30 mins in the summer time can really just mess up your whole day bc you be tryna look all cute but before you can even get to where you going you look like a damn oil spill in the ocean

547 2018-06-12 22:46:26 Random thought in bed tonight... just remembered when we were in primary school and there was that big painted oil tank in the yard and at lunch we would lean in under the tap and pretend it was an ice cream machine. We had the best games in that yard.
548 2018-06-12 22:46:25 2)...on a few times a day. When you wake, mid day, & before bed. Plant based substance that acts like morphine in  topical uses. You can use extra virgin olive oil if you wish, but I think the OCO is better. The massage part is vital for nerve damage. Prayers & Blessings.
549 2018-06-12 22:46:24 they have no fruits to verify their profession or their confession...the word anoint in greek means to smear or rub with oil, the Messiah is Elohim's anointed one, and oil was not use to anoint Him, but the Spirit in Him was His anointing....rituals by early believers was just
550 2018-06-12 22:46:23 start on a low-level oil Amy.
551 2018-06-12 22:46:15 Yes, I read about terrorism, 
If America and China are present, why haven't they helped Africa regain Control from terrorists? 
If Akon has made such a change, why haven't the African Government looked after its people, with the money, they made from oil?

565 2018-06-12 22:44:15 And what exactly did obama do? My retirement fund and stocks sucked under him.  My real estate value did not do much.  Job market poor.  Oil prices up down up up up down..   military stripped of needed artillery etc, trump gets in and within two months - we are strong again.
566 2018-06-12 22:44:15 What was the result of this overhyped summit of “President Trumps” you might be asking?? With all the hype and media sensationalism the result of this bullshit summit was *Drumroll Please*.............Jack and Shit!!! This asshole president is a two bit snake oil salesmen!!

576 2018-06-12 22:42:57 THEY CAN SELL OIL ? OR  SAUDI ARABIA HAS TONS OF MONEY FOR THEIR ARAB NEIGHBORS  ! ! 
577 2018-06-12 22:42:49 Trump doesn't have anything to do with. It's  individual states that set tax. Also it depends on cost of crude oil we purchase. Hope you learned something.
578 2018-06-12 22:42:36 Just wanna helpvyou brother the oil on your life and what GOD has impregnated you with is sooo powerful so go after everything GOD has put inside of you..hmu anytime and if you ever wanna pray together lmk and illl give you my number
579 2018-06-12 22:42:28 It's a modern version of snake oil. Selling an illusion is Trump’s specialty.  He builds an implied expectation without ever delivering.  It's what he does.  He’s very effective with the art of a con.
580 2018-06-12 22:42:27 For those of my friends that use and tried CBD Oil, how has it changed your life? 

For me it has helped so much!! Been using CBD oil for 2 years and seen remarkable changes in many areas of my life. How about you??
581 2018-06-12 22:42:27 Haven't tried it yet but cannabis oil is one thing I used. My doctor also gave me maxalt which helped sometimes.
582 2018-06-12 22:42:24 Wouldn’t be able to tell them from the REAL dead people.
583 2018-06-12 22:42:22 Tonight’s dinner is nearly all Canadian grown (except for the olive oil & wine) - artic char, asparagus, potatoes, salad radishes, greens, arugula, green onions, strawberries, maple syrup. Very grateful for the abundance my country provides. #ThanksCanada #farmersmarket

592 2018-06-12 22:40:40 I feel for you man. I just got over a cold about a week ago. I’d recommend Oil of Oregano to prevent/get over a cold. (If you do end up getting it, get the pill version. The actual oil tastes pretty bad even if you dilute the taste.)
593 2018-06-12 22:40:37 I don't think it makes up a meaningful percentage of the import bill. A bigger challenge: cooking oil. Maybe Pakistan should explore ways of shifting domestic consumption toward healthier olive oil and producing more of it at home.
594 2018-06-12 22:40:35 the dudes changing my cars oil had to google how to open my hood once it was popped... i really hope my engine doesn’t start on fire

603 2018-06-12 22:40:02 I would legitimately pay for someone to go get my oil changed just so i don’t have to deal with the condescending idiots at the dodge dealership. Now taking applications.
604 2018-06-12 22:39:55 At the end of the day, Canada is a pretty self sufficient country.  We have oil, natural gas, the largest supply of fresh water (huge)... flint might like that... no, we can grow produce all year, but we can buy from other sources.
605 2018-06-12 22:39:52 Oh and Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug 2nd 1990 occupied them for 7months which is when the UN mandated they leave they didn't so a Coalition Force Headed by the US kicked his ass all the way back to Iraq. But on their way out they lit 600 Kuwait oil wells on fire. Got it.
606 2018-06-12 22:39:48 Jajajajaja, te traemos de experta en oil & gas cuando saquemos esa solución :). Todavía es muy limitado en ese sentido, pero algunos usuarios han hecho cosas muy bakanas.
607 2018-06-12 22:39:48 1)It might sound strange. Grow Milkthistle weeds, taller the better. Snip blossoms & discard. Harvest full stem, slice it lengthwise, scoop out the 'milk'. Add a good oil like organic coconut oil, warmed, & mix. The oil makes it less sticky, plus it's good for your skin. Rub it..
608 2018-06-12 22:39:44 This is what we agreed to in The Agreed Framework document. 

* Deliver 500,000 tons of heavy oil annually to DPRK as an alternative energy
* Make arrangements for two 1000 MWe light water reactors to DPRK with target date of 2003.

611 2018-06-12 22:39:04 crude oil to the USA.they buy it cheap because there is no competion.Its refined and sold  at market value or more .Canadian crude oil exported to the USA last year,was 51 billion dollars,add the USA trade surplus.
612 2018-06-12 22:39:00 What do we actually manufacture anymore. We have natural resources but produce dirty oil.

615 2018-06-12 22:38:23 No but I will.  Bit worried about the amount of oil needed.  And it doesn’t specify. (Ominous)
616 2018-06-12 22:37:58 I love it when foundations claim to be ‘oil free’ and I foolishly believe them. Suddenly I’m £34 down and staring at a shiny sloth in my mirror 
617 2018-06-12 22:37:56 Guess you forget where you get the majority of the crude oil from. Also to slap a tarriff on the people who buy the nost of your steel and aluminium products bot the smartest move. Also you hid behind national security. Had YOU been honest it would be different.
618 2018-06-12 22:37:55 Coconut poses concern for any person who has salicylate sensitivity, including coconut oil, albeit this detail is rarely addressed. I think that alongside discussion of the health benefits of medium chain fatty acids, salicylic acid should be noted as warranting caution for some.
619 2018-06-12 22:37:49 I WAS proud of myself for getting an oil change after being 3,000 overdue only to look at my bank account and realize I only have $1.37 until I get paid again 
620 2018-06-12 22:37:42 Jag tycker mycket om biotherms oil therapy! Den luktar ganska mycket aprikos men står man ut med det är den nice, no frityr! Jag har sjukt torr hud på kroppen kan tilläggas.

655 2018-06-12 22:32:40 It looks like white oil based paint mixed with white spirits. If the tile is porous, it has soaked in and you will need to replace. Try some fine sandpaper and see if it shifts at all as a last resort

665 2018-06-12 22:29:49 1 bottle of 40ml of oil plus 10g of dried flower costs me 97$ and thats only 1/3 of my prescription. I only have flowers for 7-8 days by stretching and the oil by microdosing it lasts me max 20 days, i should take 4-6ml/day for my issues but only use 2ml to stretch it.

673 2018-06-12 22:28:57 I am about to go off! Why does everything have Soy, Wheat, or Dairy in it. I can't even eat here anymore. @glutenfreedoc Halp meh please!! Also be sure people are aware most fried food is fried in soy oil. They use the best GMO soy for that fryer shortening.
674 2018-06-12 22:28:44 Especially since Saudi Arabian oil is far cheaper, and cleaner than ours. 

And from what I heard recently, China doesn't even want this product anymore because it is too expensive, and the global market has changed.
675 2018-06-12 22:28:40 #ARCT: It is difficult to understand why the Trudeau government imposed a moratorium on oil & gas in the Arctic. The region is so vast and economically underdeveloped. Arctic leaders have told Senators they do not approve of the moratorium – but they were not consulted./2
676 2018-06-12 22:28:38 If i was to make my own beard oil would anyone be interested in some?
677 2018-06-12 22:28:07 remember when the oil industry was monopolized in the US and the govt had to step in and break it up because it turns out letting megacorporations do what they want can be bad for the economy & american ppl. why dont more of us remember this
678 2018-06-12 22:28:00 The Democrats are signaling an interest in renewable resources. This is a step towards the future, not a fall into the past (more coal) and a stall in the present (oil). Are all Republicans against securing their energy future?
679 2018-06-12 22:27:56 brazy how i need an oil change but i’m at forever 21 with 8 swimsuits in my hand.
680 2018-06-12 22:27:50 I don't get Rebel Media - Jews who promote Nazis, "freedom" lovers who promote autocrats, oil lovers who hate pipelines.
681 2018-06-12 22:27:49 olive oil, can be doing with your usual oil in the kitchen, put a few drops in and then leave it to soak in your ear for 10 minutes, repeat twice a day x

Great player but time has caught up with him. He was never the fastest but now a oil tanker can turn quicker
684 2018-06-12 22:27:06 Be sure to eat lots of coconut oil. It helps prevent Rickets.

Gregs, would you do a trade with the Canadiens involving Lucic and the 10th pick, for Shea Weber? Maybe the oil eat a small portion of contract?

740 2018-06-12 22:19:17 The first oil shock was when Nixon threatened to intervene in the Yom Kippur War and OPEC cut us off completely. Rapidly rising oil prices led to rapidly rising inflation, which led to rapidly rising unemployment. Econ 101. Nixon imposed wage and price freezes for God's sake.

747 2018-06-12 22:18:17 I’m so entirely sick of my neighbors Indian cooking smelling this bad. The money I have to spend on candles to keep up with the stench is unaffordable. Mind you I have my essential oil diffuser going too.

752 2018-06-12 22:17:48 Just a guess...rig count is up..cost money to drill...the price of being independent as opposed to dependent...OPEC controls the cost of oil way more than America....America does not control the oil market as much as some think...just throwing ideas out there though.

757 2018-06-12 22:17:11 As of this moment Oil markets remain stable with production non-peaked. Major players are poised to offset any shortage. Talk of pie in the sky values just isn't what the industry wants as stated by Russia, Saudi, etc.
758 2018-06-12 22:17:09 Fundamentals play an important roll in long term oil prices, but if you do not pay attention to oil positioning, unless you have unlimited funds, you are going to get run over, 6 wks ago, HF started unwinding...indicators aside..this was a clear indication prices were going down

772 2018-06-12 22:15:40 Economists view energy as a substituable resource/commodity, which it is not, particularily oil, which powers virt. 100% of our global supply chains. Without cheap manuf. offshore and cheap oil to get goods here, the middle class would have shrunk massively a few decades ago.
773 2018-06-12 22:15:23 To try to have SOME routine in my life, I have decided to do my skin care routine that i used to do before bed when i was not violently depressed:

2. Wash off
3. Apple cider vinegar cotton pad! swipe face
4. Ice water to cool 
5. SMALL AMOUNT of coconut oil

775 2018-06-12 22:15:02 For people with dry skin, try taking a coconut oil bath. Just put in a scoop of coconut oil, into your bath water. It feels relaxing and the coconut oil hydrates your whole body, better than most lotions.
776 2018-06-12 22:14:50 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

780 2018-06-12 22:14:28 I don’t see any railroad spills/derailments of oil on any of these sites. Why would that be? Do they not happen? Sudbury Ontario had two a couple years ago, and still not cleaned. 1 on river bridge.
781 2018-06-12 22:14:14 I got a lavender lemonade not knowing the oil had CBD in it. Is this an edge break?
782 2018-06-12 22:13:58 No other American Leader has been this disdainfully insulting to a supposedly very close allied nation. We are your LARGEST trading partner. Good luck when we shut the oil down. Have a great day, though!

793 2018-06-12 22:12:20 Reagan went back to loading up on Mideast oil. He was actively bribing the Iranians, while helping Saddam kill his own people to maintain stability in the region. He didnt give a shit as long as oil markets were stable.

A terrible human being. Terrible.

817 2018-06-12 22:09:44 With CBN Naira stage-mgmnt using upside from foreign reserves (buoyed by ‘good’ oil price), things look ‘calibrated’ to encourage investor inflows - a fixed fx window. But can this ephemeral window support long tenured bond holding? Are NG bonds really outperforming in realsense?
818 2018-06-12 22:09:43 Hoi...bad yan...oil nlng...haha...
819 2018-06-12 22:09:42 Got the oil, break fluid, & power steering fluid changed out on the F150. Just have to drop the transmission pan to change the trans fluid & filter.
At that point she's in good enough condition to drive back & forth to work.

I'm hella dirty atm so shower, food, then stream. 
820 2018-06-12 22:09:38 No... Being competent and political ideology aren't the same thing. The critical flaw in Venezuela now has to do with the price of oil dropping. And that the government spent everything that came in. All those social programs cost money.
821 2018-06-12 22:09:29 oil that bearing nibba!
822 2018-06-12 22:09:24 Tried oil pastels again today and I can say I don’t hate them as much as I used to. Still not the biggest fan, but they aren’t god awful to me anymore.
823 2018-06-12 22:09:21 Uthman bin affan (R.A) used to offer the people fine food, then he would go into his own house and eat vinegar & olive oil.

825 2018-06-12 22:09:11 I cant even blame you cus same. You'd just see my ugly mug popping up grinning bare teeth. Oil still on hands
826 2018-06-12 22:09:07 Go back to your history book and we will talk. Did you forget Irak and Bush? This was not long ago. The war was anly for oil and it brough down the whole country.

829 2018-06-12 22:08:43 my dad recently bought the spray kind for brailon and i've been using it too and it's been helping a lot (it gets rid of my headaches super fast) so if u can invest in the oil too o:
830 2018-06-12 22:08:37 Who cares. It is his families business. If it was a POTUS who came from oil and gas, they would talk oil and gas exploration. Or, some other industry. If it is sports ownership background, talk about bringing a football team to NK. Bono will talk about music. etc.
831 2018-06-12 22:08:36 There’s a reason horseshoe shaped toilet-rugs are priced accordingly. 
Please, America - replace them at New Year’s, Memorial, and Labor Day or with every oil change - whichever comes first.

847 2018-06-12 22:05:49 my point is this.....if you want to do reclamation on  oil sands projects.....get the oil out first....don't set either or policies to protect foreign interests.....build your 7 pronged approach to use the best technology for each...and don't get played.
848 2018-06-12 22:05:43 I should probably go get my oil changed. But I’m reaaaaaally sleepy atm.

850 2018-06-12 22:05:27 Well our strategic interests are really oil and the money from oil. So if we keep drilling and fracking, we will have a significant impact on how significant the ME is to us. That is the primary reason I favor seeking more oil. Same with Russia.

Let’s all talk about fasting, mindful movement, listening to your bones, cauliflower pizza, carrot noodles & coconut oil. Maybe you need to visit #Pioppi where you get all that with knobs on. Relax.
854 2018-06-12 22:05:05 Also check the report from @CCPA_BC about oil industry price gouging. When world oil price fell ~65% the price of gas in #MetroVancouver dropped ~18%, But every jump in oil prices is reflected by an instantaneous response at the pump.

864 2018-06-12 22:03:20 Thanks Maurine, you've always been among the more open and broad-minded NDPers. I agree renewables will and shld grow but oil demand will keep growing too espy due to population growth and rising living standards in third-world nations. There are numerous ways forward, many good.

878 2018-06-12 22:01:15 Trump is very competent in that:

* opening doors for Trump Grifting Inc

He cares nothing about country (US). 

Putin would love a war. His 2 big resources are oil & Mafia. Both do well with uncertainty and/or war.

880 2018-06-12 22:01:01 Didn't they break up standard oil?  Why is the government (courts) allowing formation of these big monopolies again? Clearly it's not a good thing for the consumer or for competition by new technologies and emerging companies!

950 2018-06-12 21:50:32 I don’t agree with you John but welcome your opinion! I think oil prices have been on a roller coaster for some & will continue to be.  Yes, demand for oil will continue but renewables will grow &  oil prices will drop. It’s the only way forward.

955 2018-06-12 21:49:25 I let E have at least 20 minutes of naked time each day to air out her bum. We haven’t had any rashes yet (knock on wood) and coconut oil with every change! I swear by the coco oil!

965 2018-06-12 21:47:55 Essay question: Does the oil patch have its own subprime crisis?
966 2018-06-12 21:47:47 There’s no oil in Korea
967 2018-06-12 21:47:33 yes that + peppermint oil! and some caffeine.
968 2018-06-12 21:47:32 Gotta rub oil in between 
969 2018-06-12 21:47:29 Maybe they should help Trudeau pound sand in search of oil. The odds of both are as hood as finding a pot of gold somewhere over the rainbow.
970 2018-06-12 21:47:26 I hear a Keto diet works well for that, you should try some MCT oil.
971 2018-06-12 21:47:06 3 years back the price of oil was 50 $  and today is 76 $, and production of oil in Saudi Arabia is 12,000000 barrels  , and calculate till tomorrow

After listening to @MostUnwantedPod they mentioned this black substance #Scully got on her hands. Which makes me think to the black oil....#TheXFiles #RandomThoughts

980 2018-06-12 21:45:58 There are two signatories to the Act of Union 1707 Scotland and England.  Either can revoke it.  Watch WM revoke it the moment oil has run out, don't be so nieve.
981 2018-06-12 21:45:19 Maybe, but at the time metallurgy and oil/grease wasn't nearly as good as what we have now.
982 2018-06-12 21:45:15 Mmmhmmm! If I’m in the neighborhood or want body oil, I mosey on down there

985 2018-06-12 21:44:46 It's true. But those fu kers are tiresome. I have to admit I have bought peeled garlic in the business for many years. But my wife only uses the fresh. I like to roast them in virgin olive oil. Cut off the tops and bake em with a tiny bit of war and the oil in a slow oven.
986 2018-06-12 21:44:30 OMG when u put peppermint oil on your scalp 
987 2018-06-12 21:44:22 GUNDLACH: EXPECT OIL TO RISE TOWARD $80-$90 A BARREL. #OOTT

988 2018-06-12 21:44:16 So, we broke up Standard Oil, broke up Ma Bell, and saw them congeal back together like in Terminator 2. . .and now we're just willy-nilly letting anyone merge? Will we ever trust bust again?

1001 2018-06-12 21:41:55 Now that you mention this, I’ve seen filets that were cooked upside down where the oil and chicken fat pooled in the middle and could have been mistaken for spit.
1002 2018-06-12 21:41:54 Iran and Venezuela are contributing to rise in oil prices. Both are suffering from sanctions which Trump may increase.

1003 2018-06-12 21:41:42 Oooo I haven’t tried aloe yet! I always end up using sunflower seed oil or jojoba, but I will try that! And I hope your ears are okay now!!! That sounds like it hurt so bad ( ; _ ; )
1004 2018-06-12 21:41:38 Totally going to eat $100 worth of cookies, popcorn and juice boxes while getting my oil changed at the dealership. Only way to make it worth it.
1005 2018-06-12 21:41:33 Extra virgin olive oil is the healthiest fat on the planet. It is loaded with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and powerful antioxidants that can fight inflammation.

1012 2018-06-12 21:40:27 Yeah I've heard castor oil is nasty. Figured that was one I was definitely going to stay away from 
1013 2018-06-12 21:40:25 Okay I have that, I use it for my eyebrows! But won't it be hard to wash out of my hair since it's such a thick oil?

1017 2018-06-12 21:40:13 don’t dye it for a while or use heat on it, only wash it once or twice a week or if you have to wash it don’t use shampo just conditioner so it doesn’t dry it out. also argan oil after shower and comb through that’s how i’ve gotten mine to grow long again
1018 2018-06-12 21:40:00 Mr Stable Genius, please allow me to explain. Not all countries manufacture everything, hence trade deficits

Example Saudi Arabia. They have a HUGE surplus in OIL. But they don´t manufacture anything else. Will you be punishing them as well for their big oil surplus with the US?
1019 2018-06-12 21:39:48 aku makee soalnya kalo oil menurut aq gpp tp kalo serum baru mikir2... btw ini mksdnya cream dokter muka kan? atau semacamnya
1020 2018-06-12 21:39:43 Idk it gave me contractions lol. And about 4hrs later i was in active labor. Obviously everyone is different. Castor oil did make me dilate but it was awful. Do not recommend lol
1021 2018-06-12 21:39:42 It’s good for you when 35 million people stop buying US goods? That’s what’s at stake. It’s good to have unstable oil supplies? Good luck.
1022 2018-06-12 21:39:33 Lets take a look at how the numbers shake out 2 the advantage of the US in the oil sector. I hope u realize when referring 2 a trade deficit/surplus it refers 2 the entire trade of the nations & not just 1 item in the catalog. If u don’t I surely hope ur followers do.

Wake up - he's a snake oil salesman that tells lies & makes things up to support his case.
1027 2018-06-12 21:39:11 Just picked my car up from get an oil change from @goodyear. Now my car won’t start and the windshield wipers go on when I press the start button and keep going when the car is completely off. Oil changes are much different than I remember.

1042 2018-06-12 21:37:22 I don't know the answer, just have some thoughts.
FactUS now is the global LEADER  with the largest recoverable oil reserves.
IMOWithdrawal from climate agreement and actions at G7 prove Trump WILL do whatever necessary to protect US businesses/workers/taxpayers.
1043 2018-06-12 21:37:19 Eucalyptus is great for helping breathing. I use one from doterra called breathe that I used last night and works great. I have a cold right now too. Eucalyptus, lemon, tea tree or rosemary are all good for colds. I rub it on my chest with a carrier oil. I use coconut oil
1044 2018-06-12 21:37:11 You can get this in the uk, I'll get some for him, legally. DM me and I'll forward to my laboratory supplied C oil.

1053 2018-06-12 21:36:26 America started downward spiral twelve years ago.   Became irrelevant. Bombing nations to steal their oil. Left devistation all over.

1054 2018-06-12 21:36:22 Does that chart indicate what oil is sweet, what is sour, heavy, light?
1055 2018-06-12 21:36:19 Oil Money
1056 2018-06-12 21:36:15 US takes advantage of everyone else.  Canada has options and we need to start looking at them.  We need to be importing more produce from Asia and Middle East, less from the US.  Look to markets abroad for our oil and resources rather than US.
1057 2018-06-12 21:36:03 The anti pipeline protesters don’t realize they’ve got it so good thanks to petroleum oil. In a world without the use of oil they would live like the other photo.

1060 2018-06-12 21:35:38 Oil not listening . Russia want to increase output by 1.8mbd and it doesn’t care.
1061 2018-06-12 21:35:22 @DamiMarufah I'm really enjoying the perfume oil.
1062 2018-06-12 21:35:18 But this seems more "validated" than most I've seen. Banks on primary opinion from people in respective fields - reporters living in Gaza, Venezuela for long periods for their analysis on situations, former employees in oil sector, former military people - for specific videos
1063 2018-06-12 21:35:18 Don't worry about Canada. We have everything we need. Oil beds, agriculture, mining, water........we really don't need anyone else.
1064 2018-06-12 21:35:11 If we sell the oil , we can generate the profits needed to purchase the solar panels you have displayed ... great idea to simply go out and buy solar panels ... shall we just rack them up on the “ old Canada Visa card “ ?

1073 2018-06-12 21:34:15 My girls also learned to mow the yard and weed eat weekly in addition to housework. Same way we were raised ..learn to do it all and do it all because we are family. They also learned to paint, fix dry wall, wallpaper, fix leaky pipes,clean gutters, change tires, check oil, etc.
1074 2018-06-12 21:34:06 Its so disgusting eh? Hes such a toolbag! Halifax and all out east has amazing foods and wild game of every kind..

1076 2018-06-12 21:34:01 A long-term asset with stable cash flow and good prospects is exactly the kind of asset pension plans should invest in, especially when the entry cost is relatively low. The risk came from FN demonstrators and lefty pols, not from industry economics. Oil demand will remain high.

And, you're welcome.
1087 2018-06-12 21:31:31 No but we import and pay market rates. If we do not become a prime supplier we are always in a defensive position. Coal is going to Asian partners who are building coal@plants by the 100’s. We have to export the oil and NG. Kinder Morgan were experts and they are gone.

1093 2018-06-12 21:30:52 I'm not sure yet, really ... I've used it every day since you gave it to me, though. Right now, I'm battling a tough cough. What oil would be best for that? My wife has some oils, too, so anything you can recommend I should have access to.
1094 2018-06-12 21:30:50 Ask all our mutiple oil refinerys about how we didn't cave. Oh wait we don't have many thanks to the NAFTA treaty. Just ask Bowden how their refinery is doing....

1098 2018-06-12 21:30:14 I hate when I get an oil change and they try to convince me to get extra shit nahhhhhhhh

1100 2018-06-12 21:30:05 Lavender essential oil is a natural sedative. It promotes relaxation in your nervous system. At times when you feel stressed or your conf...
1101 2018-06-12 21:29:56 The amount of fumes I’ve inhaled from just 1 hour of oil painting is obscene
1102 2018-06-12 21:29:51 Look for some one to ride the sweet ass with oil get it just like pussy
1103 2018-06-12 21:29:23 Try the other way around. Canada supplies 41% of your oil and we have the 3rd largest reserves in the world.
1104 2018-06-12 21:29:01 Went for a oil change and these people telling me everything that’s wrong with my car... first of all I ain’t ask you that, second mind your business 
1105 2018-06-12 21:28:56 Fucking massive mate. Got its own gravitational pull, micro atmosphere and distorts light waves too. 
In fact if the US thought it had oil they be bringing ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’ to it.
1106 2018-06-12 21:28:47 Another book to misinterpret and hide behind. U r right! It’s all about wealth and power. And oil. Oil is power. And wealth.
1107 2018-06-12 21:28:46 Really. You wanna learn THAT lesson again?
1108 2018-06-12 21:28:42 I love snake oil
1109 2018-06-12 21:28:41 Get ready to start kissing their ass, in addition to all the oil, drug and defense company asses you've had to kiss already.
1110 2018-06-12 21:28:41 But all that "bottleneck" narrative will not effect US Oil Production. It is onward to 11 million bpd. And Anas Alhajji IS A FRAUD. He kept claiming US Oil production wasn't going to rise back when it was 9 million bpd. We are 3 weeks or so away from 11 million. #OOTT #Oil #CL_F
1111 2018-06-12 21:28:40 Grantham: You can divest from oil or anything else without significant financial consequence.#micus
1112 2018-06-12 21:28:15 Risking? Quite the contrary. Of course it’s a great asset to own, today or especially when tripled to capacity. Love to have my #CPP funded by it. If Canada does not ship oil to Asia or US someone else will. Massive tax $s at stake for nation incl BC with very manageable risk !
1113 2018-06-12 21:28:04 おはよーごぜーます
1114 2018-06-12 21:28:02 Cannabis oil can easily be acquired in this country it's not legal granted but for her son's sake it's the only path available.keep fighting for a law change but in the meantime let and I'm sure she's had offers others get it for her son.
1115 2018-06-12 21:27:56 If you ever feel stupid just remember that I put leftover deep fryer oil (recently used to fry cod) in my cookie batter because we put it in the vegetable oil container
1116 2018-06-12 21:27:55 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius

1118 2018-06-12 21:27:19 Could be worse they might try harpoon you and use you for oil!!!
1119 2018-06-12 21:26:54 As long as Donald Trump walks, there will be no peace. It's like mixing oil with water. There is not one humble drop of blood, in his bloated body or ego, His actions are only a base for his own narcissistic needs, he doesn't heal, he rips open wounds so he can profit

1121 2018-06-12 21:26:24 A whole bottle of tee tree oil spilled in my bag
1122 2018-06-12 21:26:23 Great job Tiffany! Forever to Thee!
1123 2018-06-12 21:25:46 You admitted in your speech you wouldn’t own up to anything with NK. Just like Trump Russia,  money laundering and all your adultery. Just deny deny deny. Trump the snake oil salesmen. #TrumpLies
1124 2018-06-12 21:25:41 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
1125 2018-06-12 21:25:41 Fox News does not have real journalist Sean Hannity is an Entertainer to pour oil in it that when Trump was on there they had to let him go cuz he was biting himself
1126 2018-06-12 21:25:32 Burning the midnight oil in a later than usual slot tonight: it's me with the back pages? Going all the way? Or coming back home? It's time to set the world in motion. But will the three lions be up for it? We're on the ball, on @talkSPORT, from midnight.
1127 2018-06-12 21:25:27 Pesto is just basil, olive oil, and garlic, right? Maybe pine nuts and cheese, if fancy. Should be a good alternative to tomato sauce to avoid heartburn.
1128 2018-06-12 21:25:00 Meh, they're trying to point score. And, quite frankly, considering the bloke they had in that seat was an oil and gas lobbyist, I'm not really bothered we unseated them.
1129 2018-06-12 21:24:59 Imagine four countries with each 25% of oil left. As electric cars take over and solar grows, Oil will soon be worth the cost of extraction with a pitiful profit margin, so a commodity. There’s only time for two of the four countries to sell their reserves with nice margins.

1132 2018-06-12 21:24:29 Fam. I’m bout to get my free oil change and go. Dassit. Dassal.
1133 2018-06-12 21:24:11 well you keep on supporting the great united states for murder, war crimes, torture, dirty oil money, etc :)
1134 2018-06-12 21:23:46 The primary reason is oil based. Forcados terminal had loading delays most of this month and Bonny terminal has been on force majeure for about the same period of time with the NCTL out of service.
1135 2018-06-12 21:23:44 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
1136 2018-06-12 21:23:16 You mean new and improved Al-Germany
1137 2018-06-12 21:23:09 One suspects the level of the #oil policy discussion will be inversely proportional to the quality of play.
1138 2018-06-12 21:22:55 No!! That’s why I’m pissed like TF. Synthetic oil is a bitch man
1139 2018-06-12 21:22:52 Sad thing is that due to mission Tesla is up to, people would work there for free. I know it bc am that example and yes, there is some substance in doing the right thing when influence of oil money is literally killing people
1140 2018-06-12 21:22:46 Your friend and buddy is the first idiot and Dana Bush Perino another idiot when her boss Bush went to war just for oil
1141 2018-06-12 21:22:38 I had to do a spray with water, Apple cider vinegar and peppermint/tea tree oil to reduce itching. Then vitamin e oil after on the scalp
1142 2018-06-12 21:22:37 Of course, but unlikely to happen for years yet we so backwards looking here sadly.
In meantime, humbly suggest buy a magic butter machine.
Less than six degrees separation you will know someone u can get an ounce at a time for 3-400$ and make batches of butter or coco oil easy
1143 2018-06-12 21:22:20 Gotta grease my scalp again , get y’all some black Jamaican castor oil & coconut oil . That shit works wonders
1144 2018-06-12 21:22:13 Oh for .....Captain Coconut Oil probably had something to do with this... "Hey guys, if we don't look good as a team, we're not gonna play good. Gotta have positive vibes here" #TanYourCujones

1147 2018-06-12 21:21:26 McMaster is jusr the kinda guy Trump likes. Another blowhard feeding on those who are working too hard to see what's under his snake oil salesman veneer. South Carolina’s workforce has grown at one quarter the rate of its working age population since he became governor. LOSER!
1148 2018-06-12 21:21:19 When will they break up  Standard Oil?

1151 2018-06-12 21:21:14 We have resources to sell or we continue to be managed by OPEC members. It’s fine for them to make billions of dollars every day? 80% of the fuel used in the world is fossil fuel. We have Matural Gas and Oil and Coal. Vancouver Ports shipmyhe largest amount of  coal.
1152 2018-06-12 21:21:13 Cacao is often use is making chocolates  and milk beverage. Suppose to be excellent for cardio vascular health! Oil, mobile phone  , ! @adamlevine @BillGates @realDonaldTrump @jrridinger @NickLoeb At least some ppl get to know you! CA is big! So big getting lost alone!!!
1153 2018-06-12 21:20:57 I don’t understand why my oil change is $80 
1154 2018-06-12 21:20:55 I get looks at work because I like the smell of hot metal and gear oil.
1155 2018-06-12 21:20:54 Like he's doing to Western Canadian oil & gas?
1156 2018-06-12 21:20:49 Hotel lotion is alway highly perfumed and void of any ingredient that contains the word “oil”
1157 2018-06-12 21:20:46 ❂ .  And this is why we blame Angra for oil spill.
1158 2018-06-12 21:20:40 The oil which Rothschild /genie oils want: remember  $chump promises "to take the oil" he is fully committed to oil theft!!!
1159 2018-06-12 21:20:38 If you can trust snake oil salesmen - go for it
1160 2018-06-12 21:20:03 Jesus Christ. You dont put olive oil on filet mignon you put butter ffs

1162 2018-06-12 21:19:47 Power. Low cadence, hi power. Averaging Chain every 1000km typically, weekly, or fortnightly clean/oil, all types of british weather. Probably crosschain a little too much.
And have just replaced chainrings.
1163 2018-06-12 21:19:27 Kodak used to be largest buyer of silver in world. When they closed, Avon was. They closed in Montreal as well. And we're all worried about taxis. Basically anything that could close/move away did. So we're left with bread makers, retail, fast food, Tim's-all low paying jobs, oil

1167 2018-06-12 21:18:50 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1168 2018-06-12 21:18:49 @jengerson @Justin_Ling we could stop imports of Harley Davidson, Amway products. Freeze Trump assets in Canada. Build our own refineries and pipelines and stop shipping oil to the US. Stop sending electricity to the US. #dontrumpclapback #sanctionTrump
1169 2018-06-12 21:18:29 How about a letter 2 the Indian gov demanding their nationals take no 4 an answer. My children will not eat coal or drink oil. How stupid do these politicians think ppl here r.

There is a newsline running at the bottom  of the screen saying Canada's oil sales expected to rise 33% by 2035.  It could rise 33% tomorrow if Western Canada starts selling oil to Eastern Canada.
1176 2018-06-12 21:17:52 2nd oil
1177 2018-06-12 21:17:51 Uh have you seen gas prices? Oil prices? And anything you’ve ever said in print? Yeah it’s clear.

1179 2018-06-12 21:17:27 They won't. The port is their major source for a monopolized black market of supplies and oil. The whole area in the north have suffered enough of escalated prices of everything. If the Houthis lose the port it will result in their collapse.
1180 2018-06-12 21:16:58 Another thing is Canada has an oil rich Providence in Alberta, where Trudeau won’t allow a pipeline to the Atlantic and British Columbia won’t allow one to the pacific. Well where do you think they’ll look next? And there’s a succession movement already. You better be careful

1186 2018-06-12 21:16:24 Tesla himself had it all figured out but JP Morgan Chase did not like the idea of giving ppl free power and made sure oil and gas was their only option.  Let me find the link....
1187 2018-06-12 21:16:08 MADE MY OWN CUTICICLE OIL TODAY>>>>
1188 2018-06-12 21:16:01 Q2 gdp growth slowed q/q. Trade contracted. All because of cbn's tightening. The endless OMO mop-ups with the high benchmark rate means interest-rate sensitive sectors of trade, commerce and manufacturing have stifled growth. If anything (militants) happens to oil, itsallova
1189 2018-06-12 21:16:00 Really.... what's your 2 cents... snake oil merchant or what?
1190 2018-06-12 21:15:59 Lavender oil in your pillow 
1191 2018-06-12 21:15:58 Chew on this,,,Canada supplies 40% of US domestic oil needs. Canadian water supply keeps most of southwestern US from starving. Canada supplies tens of millions megawatt hours of electricity to the eastern seaboard of US. Materials for US nuclear program come from Canada etc.etc.
1192 2018-06-12 21:15:54 @DannyBalis Nice meeting you at the Dogrrr event. Look into CBD oil and Kratom for non addictive pain relief.

1218 2018-06-12 21:11:49 Ripped off American taxpayers and avoided fixing the broken federal coal-leasing program.  Repealed anti-bribery rule to the delight of the oil industry.  Rolled back important protections for drinking water in coal communities.
1219 2018-06-12 21:11:48 I’ve heard good things about bio oil, so I’ll definitely have to get some. Thank you

1222 2018-06-12 21:11:00 you'll never make Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses palatable to me...nor, will you make the US"s dependence on foreign oil palatable to me, and why I live in California where every car will be electric within 15 years
1223 2018-06-12 21:10:55 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

1237 2018-06-12 21:09:25 Good to see @realDonaldTrump has established a "special bond" with a guy allegedly reported to remove competition with anti aircraft guns, mortars, flamethrowers, feeds infants to dogs, injects wombs with motor oil. Yep pretty special. Saves a lot of money.
1238 2018-06-12 21:09:24 Be straight looking like i put a half bottle of baby oil or Vaseline on my face my face be oily asf. I hate it so bad..
1239 2018-06-12 21:09:22 What crash. Oil price is going up???
1240 2018-06-12 21:09:07 Very good idea cause I have the oil and spaghetti already—the spring onions are for another dish even though I was looking for chives originally.
1241 2018-06-12 21:09:01 Yhhh I’m trying natural solutions I’m rubbing coconut oil on it and tea tree oil hopefully it works thanks cleo
1242 2018-06-12 21:08:59 Joe Biden got 2% of the vote in 2008 and dropped out right after Iowa primary.  He gave us Clarence Thomas, 2005 bankruptcy bill for credit card pals and his sone sits on Ukrainian National oil company board.  I would rather vote for nail fungus!!
1243 2018-06-12 21:08:50 @TanyaTate Thank you for reading my tweet. My idea was taking you to a private beach in Maui, and you do a sexy hula dance. I rub oil all over your body, and we make love to the rhythm of the pounding surf. #Cowabunga #Alohot
1244 2018-06-12 21:08:46 hello everyone PLEASE stop buying things with palm oil
1245 2018-06-12 21:08:43 I went from abt to pay 82.99 for a oil change to paying 47.95... so @jiffylube why 2 different prices?!
1246 2018-06-12 21:08:42 Because then the gas and oil companies would go out of business and they all seem to work together. Just like the pharmaceuticals companies and the cure for so many diseases that are being kept under wraps in America. It's sad.
1247 2018-06-12 21:08:33 eucalyptus oil >
1248 2018-06-12 21:08:31 Neem oil just arrived (it’s a natural insecticide that smothers the insects) so I will be applying it to my plants tomorrow. Insects have been tearing my collard greens UP! Mustard greens haven’t really been touched.
1249 2018-06-12 21:08:21 Savitex is a Class B drug It appears the woman wants to become a martyr as the machine to make Cannabis oil is £170 online and weed to process available on nearly every street so she could have made her own without getting caught
1250 2018-06-12 21:08:14 Those colour look like light hitting off oil, dope!
1251 2018-06-12 21:08:01 Ah wrong, Obama and Hildabeast blew up Libya! They overthrew the gov’t which was really good to their citizens such as free health care, free college and gave them some of the oil money. Yeah, Obama blew up their country and stole all of their gold, what an A hole he was
1252 2018-06-12 21:07:59 Ha! Nope...castor oil is plant based.
1253 2018-06-12 21:07:40 NY Times: China Is Testing Roads Paved With Solar Panels...

Thank god our dear leader has the foresight to bring coal back. Just wait until you see what he does with the whale oil industry!
1254 2018-06-12 21:07:26 Dropped my car off for an oil change at 9 this morning and they’re telling me it won’t be done until 3? 6 hours for a freaking oil change? Ok 
1255 2018-06-12 21:07:12 Next is the Arctic...they will go into the oil business there as well.
1256 2018-06-12 21:07:10 Saw kids killed in cages! OMG will be hard to put out of your mind. I do believe we have created the terrorists by constant butting into the Middle East over oil. Invading Iraq & Libya was based on lies. I fear karma. -2
1257 2018-06-12 21:07:00 When this dotard of a president ‘attacks’ my nation economically, I will come out with the gloves off. If we were to shut down the oil and energy production to the USA, our little nation would cripple the American economy. I hope we do.
1258 2018-06-12 21:06:31 He nods and grabs the rose oil, filling the tub up and tipping the bubbles under the faucet before lighting the candles and setting up childcare mode on Jarvis. He stands in front of Loki and smiles. “I have Jarvis watching the kids.” He points to the nanny cam, all rooms of the+
1259 2018-06-12 21:06:25 And I make this healthy n yummy slice biscuits with:
Black Chia seeds, Lecithin, Psyllium husk, a cup of healthy nuts, pepitas, Rice malt syrup, Bee Pollen, free range eggs n coconut oil.. yummy Healthy nutrients required by our body are in there.
1260 2018-06-12 21:06:18 coconut oil can fix everything
1261 2018-06-12 21:06:18 Oil is a helmet
1262 2018-06-12 21:06:11 mr. president. this is the most awesome tweet ever. maybe he should try olive oil supplements?
1263 2018-06-12 21:06:04 I had a really bad reaction last night to some night time oil. I have prescription. I was told to use an eye dropper, didnt have 1. Ended up taking 2 swigs & went into FULL hallucinations. On the brink of insanity & calling 911  That call would of ended up a comedy skit on YT
1264 2018-06-12 21:05:54 NO IT WON'T WE DON'T NEED TO TRADE WIT USA  WE CAN MAKE EVERYTHING IN HOUSE AND WE CAN KEEP N BANK OUR POWER N OIL N SELL IT AT PRIME ON THE OPEN MARKET NOT PENNIES TO US
1265 2018-06-12 21:05:53 In 1972 US short on gold bc of Viet Nam. Nixon made a pact w KSA. Only sell oil 4 US$ (petro $) & we will protect u & sell u arms. Petro $ not backed by gold. Most trade is down in US$ since that deal. Why US can borrow so much money & at low rates. -1
1266 2018-06-12 21:05:39  oh nah , I be going there to change my dad’s oil & mine & it be fine 
1267 2018-06-12 21:05:26 It was their money and it was given back as part of a deal. I get that Americans love to steal, land,money, resources, oil but it's part of a deal. How's you money spend today in Libya killing innocent children on behalf of Saudi Arabia?
1268 2018-06-12 21:05:20 ...or thinking baby oil will soften up the baby head.
1269 2018-06-12 21:05:13 Alright so after I got my oil changed today I did absolutely nothing
Like didn't even play video games or watch anime
Just lying around in bed chatting with people really
1270 2018-06-12 21:05:12 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1271 2018-06-12 21:05:12 @PnPCBC Stop selling our oil at a 30% discount.  We did a deal in good faith and your president is damaging that. Their gas prices will rise. 
"Canada is by far the largest single source of oil imports to the United States, providing 43% of US crude oil imports in 2015." #cdnpoli
1272 2018-06-12 21:05:10 API: Crude inventories up 833K barrels for week of June 8. Gasoline inventories up 2.33M barrels last wk also. $USO $OIL $UGA $XOP $XLE $OIH
1273 2018-06-12 21:04:49 Reading Noam Chomsky’s “Who Rules the World?” A definite eye opener if there ever was one.

I read this passage:
“United States control of the oil resources of Iraq -“

Simply as:
“United States of the oil resources of Iraq”

honest mistake,

...however valid an observation!
1274 2018-06-12 21:04:48 أمين
1275 2018-06-12 21:04:47 I need to go get an oil change lol !!! too lazy to go
1276 2018-06-12 21:04:28 I tried making authentic Spanish style rice and I'm worried because when I fried the rice in oil some of them started to pop open like popcorn!  I guess we'll see what happens... 
1277 2018-06-12 21:04:24 What do you thinks crude oil it’s $100
1278 2018-06-12 21:04:23 The power of the sun is actually captured in oil.  The earth makes it.  How are you going to get his jet off the ground?
1279 2018-06-12 21:04:18 “Gather round this burning oil drum children, and let me tell you a tale of how we got to this point. A tale of ‘The Man Too Principled To Stand For Anything At All’ “
1280 2018-06-12 21:04:17 Are you applying any oil to your scalp?
1281 2018-06-12 21:04:14 I mean 41% of their crude oil comes from Canada so good luck without that eh bud
1282 2018-06-12 21:04:12 I spilt coconut oil on my cracked phone and left It there bc i didn’t know and now my screen is fucked up and I won’t be back in the US for like 2 more weeks  ttylxox -emily

1284 2018-06-12 21:03:42 diuiuehf THIS IS A MESS. i completely forgot abt the bowl ugh and who tf decides to oil their hair at 2 in the morning. ugh my family is as messy as me shefhesjdjj
1285 2018-06-12 21:03:32 This is a yummy plate that I eat as well..
Fresh above ground veggies, grass fed meat, lots of spices: parsley, ginger, garlic, red onion, black & cayenne pepper, Nigella seed, wee bit of Celtic salt n our miracle Cold Press Coconut oil.. yumm
1286 2018-06-12 21:03:18 like I said, you supply less than 10% of our oil now...you're not the big player you once were and regardless, Saudi Arabia needs us more than we need you....
1287 2018-06-12 21:03:14 Shut down the oil! We supply the majority of their energy. We can play, too.
1288 2018-06-12 21:03:13 Whale oil beef hooked
1289 2018-06-12 21:03:04 This is normal with this type of shale oil (LTO)...  Distillates will gain,  gasoline will dive...
1290 2018-06-12 21:03:01 There are crimes against humanity being done in several parts of the world. 
For a host of reasons what happens in "the Holy Land" ( that's so close to major oil fields, the Suez Canal and so on) catches the attention of hundreds of millions of people.

Then there is the highly>
1291 2018-06-12 21:02:50 Just another normal day playing with coconut oil! Lol! 
1292 2018-06-12 21:02:42 .@LeezaGarber Love to see you devote that passion to big oil price gouging that happens every day. Talk about Billion$. ATT TW merger is small potatoes. @TeamCavuto
1293 2018-06-12 21:02:34 Coconut oil hair masks  my hair is super damaged too girl
1294 2018-06-12 21:02:19 *pours coconut oil over entire life*
1295 2018-06-12 21:02:14 I was an early adopter of body shop mango oil when I was like, 10. Wonder how it held up...
1296 2018-06-12 21:02:14 Iran cancellation was to decrease oil supply and increase the price which benefits Russia at our expense -  Traitor Trump is Putin’s Puppet.
1297 2018-06-12 21:02:08 Getting my brakes change , Just  Kilt me  i don’t want no car no more  i thought all it was to a car was gas &amp; oil changes 
1298 2018-06-12 21:02:07 Hickey (in my hallucination he's still on the team) rolls up in a fish oil truck like Stone Cold
1299 2018-06-12 21:02:00 How did the snake oil salesman reach this conclusion.
1300 2018-06-12 21:01:57 Clearly you don't understand how crucial oil is to our economy
1301 2018-06-12 21:01:55 Don’t hate yourself for truth. Don’t forget crucible – the purifying oil of our sufferings.
1302 2018-06-12 21:01:50 Oil and Water never Mix!
1303 2018-06-12 21:01:45 Prosperity-Apart from AB and anyone connected to oil 
Safety-sure no terrorist attacks in Canada right...
You’ll start to have the same issues as the UK soon enough with all the illegals your government is allowing to trundle across the illegal border lol

1305 2018-06-12 21:01:37 Oh no Noah... This is like the oil all over again...
1306 2018-06-12 21:01:36 Oil coal nuclear highest subsidies of any industry
1307 2018-06-12 21:01:34 Its so scary. Made by aarman in sierra leone, comes in a 5 liter oil jug. I would sip tho
1308 2018-06-12 21:01:29 yeah, the we need your oil argument is dead.... our country is also complicit in the war crimes committed in Yemen by the Saudi-led military coalition....I'm a secular humanist that doesn't buy into your propaganda..
1309 2018-06-12 21:01:22 The last Selling level which i given nymex WTI crude oil. ...working again 2 times...(1st time) $66.56 to $65.88 pft $00.68 point (2nd time) $66.69 to $66.06 pft $00.63 point total pft $1.31 point mean 1 lot pft 1310 U.S Dollars.. This is a power of my level
1310 2018-06-12 21:01:21 I believe the technology exists, just like wind energy. You're right tho,  it's greed! We're still using crude oil, no matter what effect it has on mankind, or our environment, & gas prices are increasing...again. Same principle with cancer, why cure it, when chemo is so costly?
1311 2018-06-12 21:01:13 Coconut oil  !!
1312 2018-06-12 21:01:07 The Infused Gel is my favorite; it has a great cooling sensation. I like the Headache & Stress essential oil roller for on the go. My cat gets the Pet Tincture for stomach issues too. I use it for pain, anxiety, and inflammation (including skin issues.)
1313 2018-06-12 21:01:02 Everyone on the train smells like essential oils... which snake oil convention is it this week?
1314 2018-06-12 21:00:56 They do like their olive oil in Spain lol
1315 2018-06-12 21:00:43 Appears we have iboga in Nigeria. But no, let's ban nonsense like shisha instead of looking into things like harnesses the potential of ibogaine and cbd oil to treat our addiction issues.
1316 2018-06-12 21:00:42 This is weird but use melted coconut oil as mouthwash every day up to twice a day for like a week and it should help. It’s also great for pulling toxins from your gums and tongue just don’t swallow it
1317 2018-06-12 21:00:38 Is it really Fosters if its not in the oil can? Lol.  I love those things
1318 2018-06-12 21:00:26 June 12, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1319 2018-06-12 21:00:22 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this June? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1320 2018-06-12 21:00:18 SEE BURIED  IN THAT SLAVE TRADE DEAL  IS ALL OF CANADA'S INDUSTRY STEAL GOLD OIL GAS IT ALL WENT TO USA FOR PENNIES N THEY TAXED IT 4 TIMES N SOLD IT BACK TO US IT JUST INFURIATES ME EVERYTIME TRUMP SAYS USA  IS THE VICTIM
1321 2018-06-12 21:00:17 The United States Government. They are an ally! We have an agreement (since 72 I think) they will only sell oil for USD. Oil & money makes them very lovable even when they chop off heads.
1322 2018-06-12 21:00:01 Praying that the six-marker tomorrow is on collision theory, cracking/ fractional distillation of crude oil or climate change  #GCSEs2018 #EdexcelChemistry #Foundation #Prayers4Easy6Marks
1323 2018-06-12 21:00:01 China is smuggling in oil and other goods at a higher rate now than ever. NK is not self sufficient. How do you think they survive?
1324 2018-06-12 21:00:01 I put some coconut oil in it (he’s weird and doesn’t like chicken broth wtf) and he finally drank 
1325 2018-06-12 21:00:00 Never again will "the oil is running out" work as an excuse to belittle Independence
1326 2018-06-12 20:59:59 I'm going to BC anyway - but I'm bringing my own oil with me!

1328 2018-06-12 20:59:55 Our dairy industry is highly regulated and thus the costs go up for everyone and needs to be protected. We don't want to drink your shit milk that's obviously making half your voters brain dead. You won't be needing our oil then either will you?
1329 2018-06-12 20:59:53 Me before I even taste the food at a restaurant: do you have hot sauce or chili oil 

Waiter: for... the ice cream? 

Me: yes
1330 2018-06-12 20:59:50 Canada supplies 40% of our oil, Saudi Arabia 9%...think again
1331 2018-06-12 20:59:33 Except we do not stand up for #BC's fishing and tourism workers. We really like fossil fuel industry jobs here in the #LiberalParty, so much so we are going to spend your CPP to pay #American oil companies!
1332 2018-06-12 20:59:24 Lmaoooooooo I shoulda told him his wife lyin cause that ain’t no damn oil down fr 
1333 2018-06-12 20:59:11 Perplexing:
Trump has convinced his voters that somehow Deregulation benefits them
Polluted streams&rivers?
Cars polluting air?
Offshore oil drilling risking another DeepwaterHoriz.
Dereg banks risking another finan. crash
Wiping out 401/ks & RE prices AGAIN
Trumpers buy anything
1334 2018-06-12 20:59:03 Umm...what oil did we get exactly?

How do you define war crimes?

As my husband (veteran) would tell you:
The winners of war never create war crimes, only the losers.
There is no rules in war.
1335 2018-06-12 20:58:54 Vitamin E oil is much better.
1336 2018-06-12 20:58:53 Crude oil uses:
 camping gas = cooking (easiest to ignite)
 petrol = car fuels
 kerosine = aircrafts (lightweight)
 diesel = fuel for larger vehicles
 fuel oil = ships + heating
 bitchumen = road surfaces, roofs (high viscosity, hard to ignite)  
#edexcelchemistry
1337 2018-06-12 20:58:45 we now make 40% of the oil necessary, and Canada is our largest supplier....No more wars for oil....we've lost too many lives for capitalism..no more...I'll stick with my electric car
1338 2018-06-12 20:58:37 ‘I need an oil change, time to get rid of this shit’
1339 2018-06-12 20:58:22 If I cook in butter or ghee or even coconut oil, most of my food is the same way (ironically enough). Saturated fats are stable and don't go rancid easily. Cheese has a lot of saturated fat. And refined carbs (bread/crust) usually doesn't denature either.
1340 2018-06-12 20:58:13 Fuck it I'm just going to take my hot takes to Twitter. 

Judas was a revolutionary communist and jesus was a reformist socdem. 

Peak oil is a myth

Vanguards are bad

The CIA purposefully funded the NWA to push more drugs onto the streets.
1341 2018-06-12 20:58:08 ive been on new medicine for my skin for literally one day and my skin went from an oil slick to a fucking lizard
1342 2018-06-12 20:58:05 @severin insider let see how it run . Probably getting a oil change and let see if this  can move forward
1343 2018-06-12 20:57:32 Boiling oil might be good too. Just a thought.
1344 2018-06-12 20:57:30 Plus egg and avocado pear, with some small palm oil over it
1345 2018-06-12 20:57:25 we don't need Saudi oil
1346 2018-06-12 20:57:07 My nephew is 4 has multiple seizures every a day. Cannabis oil has been his saving grace. Taking if from this boy is like signing his death warrant, lacks caring, understanding is reprehensible. Shameful behaviour. 

 #EmpathyDay
1347 2018-06-12 20:57:05 I think it is much more complicated than just having nuclear bombs, they are of no match with US arm base and ability to intercept.
On the other hand, Iran is a much bigger country, economy with proxies all over the region.
Secondly it possess the oil advantage & strait of hormuz
1348 2018-06-12 20:56:54 おはようございます〜
1349 2018-06-12 20:56:52 Some people use cleansing oil first before using facial wash. If korean cleansing oil, can be use to remove makeup and dirt before doing facial wash. Cleansing oil is a lil bit tricky depends on the content and where it is from.
1350 2018-06-12 20:56:42 If you wanna work in the oil field can pass a drug test, hard worker, won’t give up. LET ME KNOW
1351 2018-06-12 20:56:37 how many millilitres is the coconut oil?
1352 2018-06-12 20:56:30 The worst sandwich I ever ate is in Spain while I were staying with locals…
Omelette soaked with olive oïl into a big piece of bread… 
Couldn't eat it…
YUK!!
1353 2018-06-12 20:56:28 Donald Trump is a perfect Oil Can Harry, trying Pearl Pureheart to the tracks - for her land or whatnot.
1354 2018-06-12 20:56:27 True. US growth over the Trump span is about what it was over Obama’s last 2 yrs. What IS different is economies of EU & other industrialized nations—finally kicking into higher gear. Oil is “spongeable”—Total demand & supply are what matters, not demand in one nation or another.
1355 2018-06-12 20:56:20 Step right up folks, the world's greatest snake oil salesman begins his pitch, fresh off his global political theater (that's dramaturgia in Kremlin-speak)___lots of flashy show, so little substance. No verification, no timetable, weaker terms than than the Six Party Talks. #SAD

1358 2018-06-12 20:56:01 You should try using a scrub for your lips and of course daily apply if chapstick. Oh I heard coconut oil is good for your lips too
1359 2018-06-12 20:55:58 ohhh yes there was so much oil/pollution in the Cuyahoga that it caught fire!
1360 2018-06-12 20:55:55 Feels like i have old oil in my mouth is SUCKS
1361 2018-06-12 20:55:55 Only the spirit(which ever one) revealed this to you bro.
Before the ill fated annulment, IBB and MKO were very good pals.
Government contracts and oil money flowed.
Fela once sang ITT for THEM.
1362 2018-06-12 20:55:49 Oliv oil juga
1363 2018-06-12 20:55:45 But if you want to worry about security and arbitrarily apply tariffs by “standing up for the USA” you should know that Canada is good enough to supply 40% of USA oil and gas and the USA requires this for its own security. You may opt for more friendly sources if you wish. G.luck
1364 2018-06-12 20:55:15 The present civilization is doing development　and production by using oil endlessly!
Increase population and industrialize!
Development and production are first! Environmental protection is the second!
This economic principle is a true cause!
The earth is limited!
1365 2018-06-12 20:55:13 I would agree that it has oil people in a wad and that might be enough.

1367 2018-06-12 20:54:55 For Helon Habila, I can understand which is why I suggested oil on water, I liked it better. Regarding your comment on Elnathan's book, could you plain why please? I suggested it because it tells an intentionnel yet human story about the évolution of BH.

1370 2018-06-12 20:54:50 Tanning oil is all fun and games until you end up smelling like a giant piece of teriyaki chicken
1371 2018-06-12 20:54:47 good to know! two days ago i bought a cocoa butter oil gel and i’ve been using it on my face twice a day. duuuude my skin already feels really soft and for whatever reason my face doesn’t feel as oily?
1372 2018-06-12 20:54:45 Why is CBD oil a schedule 1 narcotic? Schedule 1 assumes no medical use. CBD is ONLY used for medical uses (maybe other stuff but not getting high). Big pharma's stranglehold on this country is sickening. We're the number one consumer of prescription medications..... Number one..
1373 2018-06-12 20:54:41 JT just handed Trump the auto industry cuz he couldn’t be bothered to listen. But maybe that’s his grand green plan. Oil and autos .... be damned. Got milk?
1374 2018-06-12 20:54:37 Thanks for the share Vernon! 
Kinky Kush is a dried flower product - LIIV will have an encapsulated oil product offering in CBD, THC and 1:1 varieties.
1375 2018-06-12 20:54:36 Yep, #DeepState & #Clinton trash must be having a sleepless night. Their wars have been thwarted & they are crying. No more bombing countries for their oil #Iraq #Libya  Treasonous @DNC #TheResistance - #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease
1376 2018-06-12 20:54:36 Can we stop using the term “oil based moisturizer” and “pore clogging” in the same sentence all the time.
1377 2018-06-12 20:54:36 DYK? The world is perhaps 5 years away from being able to trace the carbon and environmental footprint of a barrel of oil.  As a consumer what will you choose ? #GPS2018
1378 2018-06-12 20:54:31 Not yet. I tried tea tree oil. Where does one even get witch hazel from nowadays? I bet Lloyds don't sell it 
1379 2018-06-12 20:54:15 AT&T and Time Warner are being allowed to merge. Might as well bring back Standard Oil and call it a day.
1380 2018-06-12 20:54:11 Have you ever tried Moroccan argan oil? My hair used to be awful - didn’t grow, it was dry, split ends. Now I only use oil and it’s grown so much and feel much nicer! And cheaper
1381 2018-06-12 20:54:11 Canada on average, each and every day over the previous year, (2017) we imported 670,000 barrels of oil into our country. About half came from the U.S., with the next biggest share arising from Saudi Arabia. Why not to a 180 on the pipeline and send it to Eastern Canada instead?

1384 2018-06-12 20:53:38 Risoil started  accepting new crop rapeseed in Odessa region. On  June 9-10, the first trucks delivered crop to the elevator.  First shipments  are  characterized by high oil content. The oil content  is about 48%, which translates into more than 50.5%  dry matter (Latifundist)
1385 2018-06-12 20:53:37 It's just like whack a mole. They will try to probe and prod as much as they can until they find oil. I've never seen anything so ridiculous. #youshittinme?
1386 2018-06-12 20:53:31 I got rose oil and now I don’t know how to act
1387 2018-06-12 20:53:23 Maajid Don’t have to justify yourself buddy, your Deen is between you & Allah. I’ve seen first hand how and why @QuilliamOrg was established well done. Eid Mubarak my brother 
1388 2018-06-12 20:53:20 Just got to look at what is happening to the devastation of forests just to produce the palm oil. Nestle aren’t the only ones at fault here, but you are a big player

1391 2018-06-12 20:53:09 Do you believe that Amazon will eventually face an anti-trust suit similar to Standard Oil in in 1911?
1392 2018-06-12 20:53:05 After use, make sure to rub some squirrel oil on your sidearm
1393 2018-06-12 20:52:48 Alex vs Eyal is like:

1394 2018-06-12 20:52:39 Smoke will pour from his ears trying to figure that out!
The aroma of burnt motor oil will permeate the room.
1395 2018-06-12 20:52:23 OMFG 911 THIS IS AN EMERGENCY I CAME IN A SMALL BOWL AND JUST WASHED IT WITH WATER THINKING OK ILL CLEAN IT L8R AND KEPT IT ON TE TABLE AND MY COUSIN DECIDES THAT SHE WANTS TO OIL HER HAIR SO SHES POURING OIL IN THE BOWL AS WE SPEAK BUT ITS TOO LATE, I CANT STOP HER WHAT THE FUCK
1396 2018-06-12 20:52:18 I took my car in for an oil change and tire repair. Should have taken like an hour maybe 2. We’re going on 5 hours now that they’ve been “working” on it 
1397 2018-06-12 20:52:09 No thanks I'm rubbing a tonelada of castor and coconut oil on this shit it better grow quick
1398 2018-06-12 20:51:58 Keep yuh oil I working soil
1399 2018-06-12 20:51:48 You just repeated arrative B.S.. You're like that fraud (Anas Alhajji) who kept claiming that U.S. oil production wasn't real (he has been saying this since last summer). Now we're closer to 11 million bpd, and will be at 12 quicker than you think regardless of your narrative.
1400 2018-06-12 20:51:33 OIL AND GAS!
1401 2018-06-12 20:51:16 as a matter of fact... I think I need a oil change. soembody lemme see $90

1403 2018-06-12 20:51:05 Well I’ve done it.  I have gone full crunchy.  I am mixing essential oil blends to give to my neighbors for ticks.
1404 2018-06-12 20:51:04 You’d be right. If we didn’t give the world the car, planes, electricity, oil, gasoline, computers, radio, television, medical advancements, kitchen stoves, then ovens, modern construction, road building and bridge building as well as saving the world through 2 WWs.
1405 2018-06-12 20:51:04 Well considering I love anything pickled this is super up my alley. I don’t mind the raisins but have never had that carrot salad with a cream/mayo dressing, it’s always been like ... oil and vinegar.
1406 2018-06-12 20:50:20 Canada supplies 40% of US domestic oil needs. Canadian water supply kept most of southwestern US from starving. Canada supplies tens of millions megawatt hours of electricity to the eastern seaboard of US. Materials for US nuclear program come from Canada etc.etc. etc.
1407 2018-06-12 20:50:01 We can help stop it. One purchase at a time. Read the labels. Do not support any company, or buy any product from them if they use palm oil in their products. I read the labels and have stopped buying a lot of stuff I once enjoyed before I knew what was being done!
1408 2018-06-12 20:49:51 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
1409 2018-06-12 20:49:49 Washed hands with dish soap
Rubbed hands with olive oil
Both didn't work so I just filled a mug with milk again and now I'm  just sittin with my left hand in a milk filled mug
1410 2018-06-12 20:49:42 The present civilization is doing development　and production by using oil endlessly!

Development and production are first! Environmental protection is the second!

1414 2018-06-12 20:48:59 Most of the world's oil & gas companies are American owned.
1415 2018-06-12 20:48:56 My experimental bread recipe for tonight is this one:
20 gm fresh yeast
60 gm warm water
20 gm organic honey

210 gm cold water
44 ml sunflower oil
2 tbsp Greek yoghurt
380 gm spelt flour
330 gm organic plain flour
5 ml salt
(mix, knead, bake)
1416 2018-06-12 20:48:53 And your “we wanted their oil“ is a argument AGAINST  making any kind of agreement with North Korea. Because at least with Iraq, we could get some resources out of it. We can’t get anything like that out of North Korea.

1425 2018-06-12 20:48:05 Olive oil is the key, internal and external. It’s the best skin and hair oil. Allah speaks of it in the Quran and it’s also a Hadith to use it and consume it
1426 2018-06-12 20:47:46 You can rely on FOMO (fear of missing out) to sell that snake oil. Especially when you use the word "solid". How many years of returns does it take to convince you that the fund you are recommending has done it via something other than luck?
1427 2018-06-12 20:47:40 WTI crude oil prices settled modestly higher after a monthly report showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased output. Gold Prices Fall Below $1,300 as Focus Shifts to FOMC

1444 2018-06-12 20:44:41 You can buy cannabis oil in most health shops now. I take it daily. I've even got my mam on it lol
1445 2018-06-12 20:44:32 Coconut oil is VERY overrated and it’s a SCAM in your skin care routine it will break out your skin badly. It’s only good for your hair and teeth

1452 2018-06-12 20:43:49 #startups have many sources of fuel in order to run. An analagous few that crossed my mind:

#Money = #Oil; will eventually run out unless you can unearth more

To #build teams that build #teams = #solar; sustainable & disproportionately leverageable in a much longer time scale

1454 2018-06-12 20:43:42 I dare you to look at this and say cbd oil doesn’t work. 

Happier, healthier, less seizures, more sleep, more focused 

Can I get an Amen 
1455 2018-06-12 20:43:42 I can see that. I live in the driest state and still can't get behind washing with oil!
My best guess is that they made some kind of mistake and changed "water" to be ranked as a bad ingredient in products. "Agua" still seemed okay in other products. LOL
1456 2018-06-12 20:43:39 The resolution "bars the org from accepting contributions from corporate political action committees tied to the oil, gas and coal industries." Christine Pelosi, a party activist and Nancy P’s daughter proposed it and the exec committee unanimously approved
1457 2018-06-12 20:43:39 You guys understand that it’s CBD right which IS legal in the US. THC is illegal. EVERYONE can buy CBD/Hemp oil. I do it.
1458 2018-06-12 20:43:38 yeah. but theres more to it, havent read up on the whole dynamic yet, but lower oil prices have been voiced in russia for a bit now

1463 2018-06-12 20:43:02 So there is absolutely no motivation in driving out the aboriginal non Jewish citizens out of West Bank and Gaza? Is that your point? Looking into the Syria war whose actually funding the cause? Whose after the oil reserves as seen throughout the Arab springs saga...
1464 2018-06-12 20:42:47 Curious how significant are Gasoline stores towards Crude stores? Thought it was 2/1 for gallons of oil to produce gallons of gasoline. So trying to decipher when certain weeks Gasoline build is reported, its affect towards future Crude stores totals. If that makes sense. #OOTT
1465 2018-06-12 20:42:46 Because you mixing water n oil yeeeer
1466 2018-06-12 20:42:39 I have an idea on this, quit thinking that corporations like Walmart, Oil Companies, and Tobacco Companies need government subsidies.
1467 2018-06-12 20:42:35 if only it were the proclivities of normal people that drove these decisions... we wouldn't have over a million dead in the Iran-Iraq war... in fact there wouldn't have been an Iranian revolution in the first place if BP didn't lobby to prevent Iranian oil nationalisation in 1953
1468 2018-06-12 20:42:35 Hopefully she hooks it up with an oil change 
1469 2018-06-12 20:42:15 Yes. Snake oil salesmen
1470 2018-06-12 20:42:10 i HATE coconut flavor, it makes me gag, and i cant tell it's there. the simple truth is SLIGHTLY sweet but thats the extent of it imo. that was my original concern too but i find that as long as it's a brand where there is very low/no oil to separate it's practically nonexistent.
1471 2018-06-12 20:42:10 Tonight head in and try our Gazpacho (chilled tomato/cucumber soup)

1482 2018-06-12 20:41:13 I dunno man, state-owned enterprise isn't really 'capitalist'
Norway's treatment of oil isn't very capitalist either.
It's the 'third way' shit that Russia wanted before the neoliberals sunk in their fangs, capitalism on the state's leash and not vice-versa.
1483 2018-06-12 20:40:50 There is an $8.4B trade surplus with Canada. Which country should have the grievance? To put tariffs on steel & aluminum is asinine. Cars built in NA are created withCDN/AMERICAN resources. Bait for the base. That’s all this is. Oil can be shut off from here...
1484 2018-06-12 20:40:43 Just get the oil prices down with some alternate source of energy, all this arrogance will end on its own. This my way is highway will not last long , truth prevails. Not too far karma kicks back

1495 2018-06-12 20:39:25 Argh - you think Africa will ever forget the destruction YOU caused in Libya?  Only because you wanted to steal the oil!   Bloody war monger - LONG before @realDonaldTrump so don't blame him. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder but Americans too stupid to know.

1498 2018-06-12 20:39:05 It was not PMB that allowed oil theft of over 500,000 barrels per day for 5 years at the rate of $50,000,000 per day when crude oil was selling for $100 per barrel, it was PDP.

1502 2018-06-12 20:38:57 Putin and Kim have a "personal friendship" according to the Brookings Inst. Russia violates NK sanctions with oil sales and guest worker jobs. It's not difficult to see Putin's hand in the the talks. A cheap stunt to influence our mid-terms and keep his stooge in power.

1513 2018-06-12 20:38:07 Probably, because cannabis oil is a prohibited importation.
1514 2018-06-12 20:38:07 The oil companies and automakers have their hands in each other's pockets. They control the price of auto and gas, not the dealerships. Something I learned as a corporate accountant.  The general public has no clue what the true cost of making a car. If you knew you'd be pissed.

1516 2018-06-12 20:37:44 I also think it could not win over the loyal consumers to "pap & vleis meal". They could not crack it. Personally the taste was not that good. The oil tasted like it's been recycled x10 times before it reached my mouth

1523 2018-06-12 20:36:55 coconut milk! I prefer the simple truth brand/a brand that removes the oil. pacific, which is a local brand, is the best tho. super creamy.

1530 2018-06-12 20:36:25 So we just take the price hikes in insurance premiums and big pharma drug prices and do nothing? Both Republicans n Democrats cause alot of it I agree , and no one's begging , they work for us

1535 2018-06-12 20:35:50 We get this before every meeting withRussia. The decision comes from Putin. The political gains he has made much more valuable than a few 100kbpd more oil.

1546 2018-06-12 20:34:47 The oil companies want the public to rely and depend on gasoline and cars that only use gas, so they won't go broke. They do make autos that are economical but they auto makers purposely jack up the sale price 5000% or more so you the avg person can't afford it.

1631 2018-06-12 20:24:40 Go back and do your homework. We are 20% of your GDP. We are self sufficient, especially with oil, gas and everything else. Let’s play games and see which country wins. Canada is a pimple on the world stage. By the way, pay your NATO bill in full, slackers. #CanadaWillLose
1632 2018-06-12 20:24:33 You have to wash it first!  but seriously, sautéed with olive oil and garlic is yummers. Ok, how about kale? Same method. It’s so good for you!
1633 2018-06-12 20:24:33 Essential oil of mint close applied just under the nose is the worst idea
1634 2018-06-12 20:24:23 I moisturize my roots with PINK Lotion and it be feeling so damn good. I also need to buy some more Wild Growth Oil
1635 2018-06-12 20:24:23 Snake oil. You know this is bollocks from start to finish.

Right now to have enough to deep fry that fucker Lol
1637 2018-06-12 20:24:18 MR PRESIDENT JUST LIKE WHEN GOD ORDERED THE RADIATION AND POLLUTION THAT WAS IN THE AIR AT PREVIOUS PARADOX 5000 YEARS AGO TO GO BACK INTO THE EARTH ;AND NOW IS OIL; IF ONE CAN GET GOD'S POWERS! HE CAN ORDER ALL POLLUTION IN THE OCEAN TO SPIRAL IN TO THE SUN!
1638 2018-06-12 20:23:57 Also, you then need someone to take out the garbage every few minutes.

Do you work in the oil industry?

1639 2018-06-12 20:23:52 They are the same!!!

USNA executes Yankees and foreigners.
Invades, starves and murder people and kids for oil in several countries.

USNAers like murder and abuses, that's why they vote for Trump @POTUS.

Oil/gas opportunities etc,& we handed regional military primacy to China. Russian mob money, Chinese patents, & other emoluments paid for?
1645 2018-06-12 20:23:28 Wanna laugh a sec? I turned the stove on, put a little coconut oil in a pan, walked out of the room and completely forgot what I was doing. Smoke alarm goes off. FUCK!

1647 2018-06-12 20:23:13 The present civilization is doing development　and production by using oil endlessly!
Increase population and industrialize!
Development and production are first! Environmental protection is the second!
This economic principle is a true cause!
The earth is limited!
1648 2018-06-12 20:22:55 No they dont. If the truth is told about true cost, funding and the fact the only way to fund it is a new payroll tax of 10- 15%, they turn very fast.

1651 2018-06-12 20:22:27 Husb almost burned down our building trying to cook with olive oil, after months of my telling my that olive oil is for salads NOT COOKING, and we have safflower oil for cooking. He just had to learn on his own.
1652 2018-06-12 20:22:18 If you're stumped for a Father's Day gift, might I suggest getting an oil change for your car and sending a pic to your dad. Brings tears of joy every time...
1653 2018-06-12 20:22:16 OK WHY are jeep oil changes so damn expensive, this is highway robbery
1654 2018-06-12 20:22:14 If you ever have hair glue stuck in your hair? Use olive oil to get it out you’re welcome
1655 2018-06-12 20:22:08 I assume you will be building lots of free housing in Alberta as PM EyeBROW Selfie want to shut down the oil industry.

1657 2018-06-12 20:22:03 Get Trudeau to put oil under Supply Management.
$ 180.00 barrel would be a good start.
1658 2018-06-12 20:22:02 my hair isn't dirty i just put too much damn coconut oil in it okay bitch
1659 2018-06-12 20:22:02 Hahahahaha-wait until they cut off the oil and gas. Milk will be the least of your problems Hahahaha

1663 2018-06-12 20:21:47 I mean it can be like Armageddon, except instead of sending oil drillers to NASA, we send animal control workers with window washers.

1664 2018-06-12 20:21:47 "Snake oil" is just another way of describing the interaction between nucleic acid helices and phosopholipids

1672 2018-06-12 20:20:18 The way the US ruling class, its military, its media, its CEOs, and its politicians treat the poorest countries, and embrace oil rich feudal regimes, shows their real attitude to workers and the poor in the US itself. Home policy and foreign policy are the same!!
1673 2018-06-12 20:20:16 Why not vitamin E oil? Good for the skin and won't leave you smelling like George of the Jungle.
1674 2018-06-12 20:19:55 One of the oil men in town tell me I real unmannerly. I am flabbergasted
1675 2018-06-12 20:19:47 Be honest. Tell people they will pay an extra 10-15% tax across the board similar to SS/Medicare. Talking is one thing, paying for it another.

1680 2018-06-12 20:18:59 It was about an oil change, and my line of thought is that no one is going to spend the extra money to get a car with a turbo if they don’t have even an inkling of what it is, you know?
1681 2018-06-12 20:18:59 never been to store and didn’t see 5 different brands of olive oil. She either lying or he never went to the store

1683 2018-06-12 20:18:51 Had to give lexus $80.. for a oil change 
1684 2018-06-12 20:18:43 History is showing WW2 had no defensive requirement for the United States.  Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because we were preventing them from getting oil and attacking them over their invasion of China.  WW2 was the result of our own meddling (in the Pacific) and to save jews.
1685 2018-06-12 20:18:42 there’s a lack of baby oil in this photo
1686 2018-06-12 20:18:32 Well, the ferret food transition seems to have gone well. After 36 hours of not eating much (supplemented with salmon oil and egg yolk to keep them from suffering physically), the contents of the food bowls has drastically reduced today.
1687 2018-06-12 20:18:17 “They were out of olive oil” really means “I didn’t even go to the store”. Niggas.

1691 2018-06-12 20:17:45 Fueled with your MCT oil (and Alpha Brain) as we speak! Had it an hour ago blended into freshly juiced veggies and gave it an oddly tropical flavor, even the oil is mostly tasteless. Incredibly delicious! #power #getsome
1692 2018-06-12 20:17:15 Anything's a bottle of oil if you're perplexed enough.

1694 2018-06-12 20:16:59 Butter? Instead of olive oil or in addition to?
1695 2018-06-12 20:16:59 Ok so your answer is “ No I’ve never been to the oil sands “ ... understood.
1696 2018-06-12 20:16:52 @FoxNews Did I just hear Shep say Kim Jong Un "Got it all"????? R u delusional??The Excruciating Sanctions are still in place! 
KJU is still broke. He still has no oil and no food. 
Nothing changed for the US at all. We gave Zero. He agreed to DeNuke.
Details to be hammered out.

1701 2018-06-12 20:16:39 Food is food weather protect or not. Mostly we need oil in our body.
1702 2018-06-12 20:16:28 Granny laughing real hard....@lasisielenu  tank u very much
More oil on ur head.
1703 2018-06-12 20:16:08 The world is big enough for many ballerinas, many filing clerks, many oil producers, though some have a naturally larger production. The USA may produce some oil to be somewhat independent, but oil is NOT our gift.
Let us walk with gentle steps around this <smile> .... Renelle
1704 2018-06-12 20:16:06 Because then we wouldn't need to buy gas, oil, filters etc...
1705 2018-06-12 20:16:06 Do not- I repeat- do not use extra virgin olive oil to make mayonaise
1706 2018-06-12 20:16:02 how many jars of snake oil does a man have to sell before we can call him a snake oil salesman
1707 2018-06-12 20:15:58 Minister lied   Tina Peterson said it's just rotation 0 sale? Big Theft charges against her? Our Oil Reserves are not to be sold for a dodgy kickback + Our Minister Lie's about it.Treason =  Hanging Once but now what Happens to Corrupt Leaders?
1708 2018-06-12 20:15:54 Time to invite China in to invest in refineries and sign contracts for all our oil to go to them. Give the USA their sunset clause on current oil/gas exports.
1709 2018-06-12 20:15:52 Wow, who knew tea tree oil scars the skin 
1710 2018-06-12 20:15:51 I am SICK n TIRED of being dismissed by old white men because they think they know better. If I say I need a new oil drain plug its not me tryna be cute n quirky n know a lot about cars its ME NEEDING A NEW DRAIN PLUG SO OIL DOESNT LEAK OUT OF MY CAR.

1713 2018-06-12 20:15:07 Supply management:
Trudeau announces if Supply Management is good enough for Canadian milk, it’s good enough for Canadian oil.
1714 2018-06-12 20:15:01 The objective is to rely on non fossil fuel sources, otherwise, the H2 production process defeats the environment argument. Reliant on coal, gas, oil etc to produce hydrogen surely can’t be cheaper in the long run than renewables.
1715 2018-06-12 20:14:53 don’t go preaching about how being completely vegan is better for if you still use products containing palm oil???? Like go ahead and protect the animals but don’t forget the rainforests that they live in lol
1716 2018-06-12 20:14:52 When I see a person of the stature as @yanisvaroufakis in the same TV show with Ilaria D’Amico, a simple football journalist, I shut the TV down and think that @La7tv and @diMartedi has made an error.
It’s like water and oil.
1717 2018-06-12 20:14:46 Nope. If I buy some I want it to be in one those tubs the size of an oil barrel. These were titchy.
1718 2018-06-12 20:14:43 Cutting off their food and oil. Da
1719 2018-06-12 20:14:34 And the inability to buy olive oil is a reason.
1720 2018-06-12 20:14:33 remember jaebeom is the kind of baby to get scared when oil splatters out of a pan i love him
1721 2018-06-12 20:14:17 I changed my cars oil once in 2009.

1726 2018-06-12 20:14:03 I bought some beard oil at Ren Faire. I love the stuff. Its smells so good and makes my beard so soft.
1727 2018-06-12 20:14:00 スマブラかみやん
1728 2018-06-12 20:13:57 I agree with some of that. It's time to move away from Saudi Arabia.  Energy independence changes everything so why not switch away from oil. Disagree with going it alone. We are globally connected economically. We can't sell goods to weakened allies. NK will backstab us not Can.
1729 2018-06-12 20:13:49 My windshield wipers are broken, I’m low on washer fluid, I’ve needed an oil change since the end of March, the lightbulb on my license plate went out, I have to renew my registration in August, my inspection sticker expires in two weeks and my check engine light came on today
1730 2018-06-12 20:13:37 Googled it.
Vegetable oils, or vegetable fats, are fats extracted from seeds, or less often, from other parts of fruits. Like animal fats, vegetable fats are mixtures of triglycerides. Soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and cocoa butter are examples of fats from seeds.
1731 2018-06-12 20:13:33 unfortunate consequence of having to cater to the( mostly) QC lobby. The same way u got to cater to the oil lobby in AB. Not equating them. It's just reality.
One way or another all 3 major fed parties ( & PQ) push each other into this corner they'd prob all like to get out of.
1732 2018-06-12 20:13:29 I learned how to make a 2-egg omelette that’s under 100 calories just by substituting olive oil with Pam cooking spray lol
1733 2018-06-12 20:13:23 Except this was probably true . Anyone who did this course was set for life . Electricity was not snake oil .

1735 2018-06-12 20:13:02 Solar power will be by then $10/MWh maximum, probably much less. This is depending on conversion $6 to $16/boe (oil). Electricity should be way above 50% market share in 2050 (IMHO) (not necessarily from solar btw).
1736 2018-06-12 20:12:47 For the salad:
Chopped tomatoes 
Chopped cucumber
Diced avacado 
Few spring onions
Mango cubes( I used frozen mango)
Leaves of your choice
Chopped coriander leaves and stem
Dressing:
Lemon juice
Olive oil
Hint of mustard
Salt and pepper to taste

Combine the ingredients...enjoy!!
1737 2018-06-12 20:12:42 @narendramodi sold hope in 2014 to win election. @RahulGandhi is trying to sell snake oil to get to power in 2019. Modi will enter the battle with data on achievement, Rahul will offer ever lasting erection if you use his snakeoil. Vote wisely in 2019! #AccordingToRahulGandhi
1738 2018-06-12 20:12:30 It’s a bunch of crap coming out of his mouth. He needs to close it and so does the America in fuhrer  they need our oil and natural gas power,lumber etc.
1739 2018-06-12 20:12:30 And you know how to use it! Of course I had a bucket of oil handy but William thought otherwise.

1743 2018-06-12 20:11:58 Then I cut it into cubes & pan fry with oil (you want a low smoke point) & salt, pepper, garlic, etc. Or add veggies if I want a stir fry.
1744 2018-06-12 20:11:48 30 or more years ago I recall reading scientific article in highly respected scientific journals on peak oil, and now this?  We  should take these type of long-term projections based on models with a grain of salt #cdnpoli #abpoli
1745 2018-06-12 20:11:44 Thoughts during watching Death Stranding trailer number 71:  "What's that you got there?  Is it a water bottle?  Is it filled with oil-- OKAY THERE'S A BABY IN THERE"
1746 2018-06-12 20:11:36 そうですよね。自分は好きで時代劇は見ていたりしましたけど。何かしらの源泉となるような場所、或いは自分の中で「これが好きだったからか」とかそういった意識になるのは大きいかもしれません
1747 2018-06-12 20:11:31 This little girl at the oil change place thought caffeine got you drunk and I was internally like “only if you do Jager bombs”
1748 2018-06-12 20:11:20 Lavender and peppermint oil 50:50 ratio for moderate, 40:60 for “I’m dying”, with some kind of carrier oil (coconut is what I use),along your trapezius muscles. If you have bruxism, you can also put it around your mandibular muscles. Works well in conjunction with yoga
1749 2018-06-12 20:11:06 Does anyone have any insight on the environmental impact of this fire vs a similar size fuel oil fire?

1752 2018-06-12 20:10:50 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

1764 2018-06-12 20:09:31 Went to Pepboys for an oil change. End up spending 500 on a new starter. I should beat this hoe ass nigga up. Wasnt nothing wrong with my starter when I pulled up
1765 2018-06-12 20:09:31 Sounds like poor and marginalized people coming together demanding i be taxed more and my money be distributed to them.

1767 2018-06-12 20:09:12 I bought some hair products today  I’m always buying uneccessary shit! I was looking for oil for Kayla’s hair and ended up getting a few other things. I gotta problem 
1768 2018-06-12 20:09:09 Coconut oil does have your skin looking majestic in this sun boy
1769 2018-06-12 20:09:05 don‘t pick at it! put ice on it, tea tree oil is also great. i put toothpaste on pimples over night so i can pick them off (it basically dries it out) but it could irritate it too (don’t do it with mint toothpaste)
1770 2018-06-12 20:09:02 okay real talk i don't get why i, as a faust player, am allowed to pick the water stage in rev where you can't see the oil on the ground for shit
1771 2018-06-12 20:08:56 I cook them, then prepare a salad with cilantro, garlic, salt, and olive oil.
1772 2018-06-12 20:08:44 Gas prices went up because of the Yom Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution, not US energy policy, which actively sought to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Carter expanded offshore drilling & opened the Alaska reserves. He was not an environmentalist. He was a conservationist.

1775 2018-06-12 20:08:15 just watching a programme on Basra. The amount oif money Iraq makes throygh oil, is billions. But Basra and the rest of Iraq, full of poverty. No healthcare, schools. bus services. Its a living hell.
1776 2018-06-12 20:08:15 The @EdmontonOilers are like the Simpsons, they already did it. It was called Oil Change. So many crimes against the fans committed, twists and turns all over the place. Drafting Yakupov was the trying on the bloody glove of hockey.

1783 2018-06-12 20:07:11 Eyal is so fucking dull. He looks like his favourite topic of conversation would be the benefits of cannabis oil.
1784 2018-06-12 20:07:06 Be careful what you wish for.  The Petro-dollar forces the world to acquire dollars to buy oil which allows USA to live with high deficits. Oil and dollar inextricably connected. If SA accepts non-dollars as payment, dollar demand plummets, price inflation goes into stratosphere.
1785 2018-06-12 20:07:03 This is the reason why countries like Dubai, Saudi Arabia where able to make their oil bounty work while we and many others continue to be held back because we could not overcome the corruption it inspires.

1826 2018-06-12 20:01:27 Start with the obvious things that you eat all the time that you know you shouldn't and take those things out. (ex. Loads of butter/oil on things, mayo, ice cream, Pizza). Stop drinking things with calories and drink a ton of water ~gallon a day.

1881 2018-06-12 19:55:11 As I mentioned before, the reduction of Bears Ears moved sacred Native American sites out of the park, and they are no longer protected.

1896 2018-06-12 19:52:29 Nixon and Ford wrecked the economy and had the first oil embargo. Nixon abandoned Breton Woods, and overstimulated in 1972, which destabilized currency markets. Energy policy was put in place by Nixon (price freezes on gas/oil 1973) and continued by Ford and Carter. Read history.
1897 2018-06-12 19:52:22 I need someone in the Houston area who can get me some CBD oil or cream for my mom
1898 2018-06-12 19:52:21 If I was still at my old job I would’ve drank motor oil to end it all
1899 2018-06-12 19:52:04 I would love to know where Summer ‘17 Ally put the tanning oil because I NEED IT
1900 2018-06-12 19:51:57 I love mine. Make sure you keep the oil topped up, lubricate the ignition from time to time and either get a gear indicator or get used to where top gear is as it is a bit revvy.
1901 2018-06-12 19:51:53 Libya and Syria were nothing but an oil grab for Obama and the Clintons and the rest of there’re Cabal.
1902 2018-06-12 19:51:46 I want R2D2.

I always wanted his backstory from smelting plant that poured his parts to final rollout off the assembly line. Which nuts and bolts did they use? Was any caulking applied to his casing to seal out dampness? What form of oil courses through him?

Fans want to know!
1903 2018-06-12 19:51:19 That “they ran out” took me right up b/c it sounds like he didn’t even go to the store, just drove around the block then came back w/nothing. There are too many olive oil brands, even if Crisco is gone the store isn’t about to run out of THEIR brand stuff. Don’t play with me

1905 2018-06-12 19:51:08 So few days war proves that China is in the same basket as UK and US??? Imperialistic empire ready to napalm children for oil? If you are looking for a fool look in the mirror.
1906 2018-06-12 19:51:05 Maybe he or his family are the victims of labour policy:
Crime
Homelessness
Increasing Tax
Oil & Gas workers
Farmers
And using a byword to express his contempt for a government in disarray.

1920 2018-06-12 19:49:09 Yeah because they know the value of oil drilling . All made possible by oil
1921 2018-06-12 19:49:05 UK chose to use oil and has tax revenue to bring down personal and corporate taxation; other countries chose to keep it all in an oil fund while maintaining high levels of personal and corporate taxation, while also borrowing heavily.

1936 2018-06-12 19:46:44  oil licking Ola!!!
1937 2018-06-12 19:46:42 I feel ya! Did this last summer. Chopped fresh jalapeños from farm. Didn't realize oil can stay on hands after washing. Burned eyes when removing contacts. Childbirth doesn't compare. Chef friend said wear gloves or rinse hands w/diluted bleach. At least weren't ghost peppers. 
1938 2018-06-12 19:46:38 Why should he stop the oil?
1939 2018-06-12 19:46:35 The ponds oil control one
1940 2018-06-12 19:46:28 It kinda taste like some oil 
1941 2018-06-12 19:46:21 Disgraceful. There will be consequences. Oil workers, doctors, nurses. Beggars belief that a  party can stand by and watch so passively.
1942 2018-06-12 19:46:21 What an interesting opinion. 

So, 

1. Tangential to your actual point, there are former ski instructors in every administrative level in every resort.

2.  Harper’s only professional experience was in the mail room at Imp Oil. I’m sure you trashed him too though
1943 2018-06-12 19:46:17 I was literally frying cashew nuts in olive oil as I read this. That's like fat squared.
1944 2018-06-12 19:46:16 Burn the midnight oil is your own effort for your future and it wont risk anyone life at all cost .
1945 2018-06-12 19:46:07 he doesnt shower thats all oil he thinks shampoo is bad
1946 2018-06-12 19:46:02 it happened to standard oil it could happen again... probably won’t though

probably won’t though
1947 2018-06-12 19:45:49 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1948 2018-06-12 19:45:41 That game is strong. I should add that I had avocado toast this morning with hummus, arugula, lemon, olive oil, and cracked pepper. #thisiswhoiam
1949 2018-06-12 19:45:37 Well it fell from today's irrational rise as I stated. Now we wait for our reports. No Jimboman taunts today. It feels like an incomplete weekday without him taunting fools who are dumb enough to go against him. Though he did update the notebook (thank you). Tomorrow I guess :)
1950 2018-06-12 19:45:29 I’m all out of facial oil & clear brow gel 
1951 2018-06-12 19:45:29 so I guess since NK doesn't have oil......lost my train of thought there.
1952 2018-06-12 19:45:28 Officially working on an oil painting for when my bby comes back
1953 2018-06-12 19:45:26 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1954 2018-06-12 19:45:08 @RebeccaSeal making your Kayuk kanat. It says to 'add everything except the oil to marinate' but never mentions the oil again. When do I add the 4 tbsps oil?
1955 2018-06-12 19:45:08 I'm telling y'all this bc I care about you: do not eat subway olive oil blend. It's 90% canola and 10%E virgin olive oil.
1956 2018-06-12 19:45:07 As as now the news has reported, the recent oil leak volume was a cover-up of hundreds more liters than the 100 earlier reported. IF this kind of deception is going to occur before the pipeline is even built to completion; what kind of lies will be told about the quality of it?
1957 2018-06-12 19:45:06 Just what Trump's oil and coal rich buddies wanted!
1958 2018-06-12 19:44:52 Next time drop in a spoonful of infused oil and OH LAWD that’s a treat 
1959 2018-06-12 19:44:31 I bet you could, you're very talented. Did you ever do that thing at school with oil paint and water, lots of fun although I expect I would get into the same amount of mess I did when I was 5! #messyartist #UpcycledHour
1960 2018-06-12 19:44:24 I rubbed coconut oil into my eyes to get last night’s mascara off and I’m blind again
1961 2018-06-12 19:43:50 Based on ladies I know with/without rads, I’d always recommend Rosa Mosqueta Oil (once rads finished) and/ or a very bland moisturiser like Eucerin/Aquaphor or there was an amazing gentle and soothing Aloe Vera cream for during rads. Let me find it.
1962 2018-06-12 19:43:27 Putting a ton of baby oil on my face just makes me feel 10x better idk why
1963 2018-06-12 19:43:25 Some things are just like Oil and water and we just have to make peace with that !!!
1964 2018-06-12 19:43:24 The guy that did my oil change this morning is such a con. First of all charges me an extra 8 bucks then tells me my car is leaking oil but it wasn’t leaking oil before I got the oil changed cause I JUST got my car fixed
1965 2018-06-12 19:43:21 man we came for an oil change at nissan and genio trippen not wanting to walk me to target, i’m just tryna waste time 
1966 2018-06-12 19:43:10 Sure he would, kind of how radiator fluid works in the oil tank of a car.
1967 2018-06-12 19:43:07 本当にそう思います！

1980 2018-06-12 19:41:22 The devil is already deceiving nations, he knows his time is limited. His full blown deception shall manifest during the great tribulation when true Christians have been taken up in heaven. But those who do not have oil in their lambs shall be left to face the antiChrist's

1989 2018-06-12 19:40:38 The nerf isn't a big deal - strictly speaking, more Extractors are still faster, it's just not a linear increase in efficiency.

If you get enough power for your needs, you don't have to worry about it.

The big nerf was just cutting the Fuel RF of Tree Oil by a bit.

2035 2018-06-12 19:34:30 I'm building office furniture again & keep dropping the allen wrench. The sound of a dropped tool always transports me back to a childhood spent in various garages & machine shops with Dad. It's a sound memory as vivid as a scent memory. (In this case it'd be engine oil & sweat.)
2036 2018-06-12 19:34:25 Snake oil salesmen always dress well.
2037 2018-06-12 19:34:23 It’s a specific type of oil that cools but doesn’t damage the parts

2045 2018-06-12 19:33:19 Why wouldn’t you ignore the lefties. There is nothing wrong with being socially liberal but the world needs oil and we have lots to sell. Helps fund things like health care you guys should check it out
2046 2018-06-12 19:32:59 @jiffylube I ask for a regular oil change and I get charged with the 60 dollar one, my car doesn't need vaccumed or cleaned, I do that myself.
2047 2018-06-12 19:32:50 I'm left with no choice but to burn the midnight oil.

2061 2018-06-12 19:30:47 Nah, Sandra there just loves the iodine and baby oil sun treatment.
2062 2018-06-12 19:30:40 Canada has a lot of oil. ...OMG! 
2063 2018-06-12 19:30:39 Oil/ acid pourer thing a majig
2064 2018-06-12 19:30:34 @JustinTrudeau is selling off our resources. A refinement station where the oil is distracted makes more sense. Refine and sell to Canadians to bring cost down and keep the industry concentrated in one area.

2068 2018-06-12 19:30:12 Hey any of my weed lovin friends have any tips on where to find medicinal cbd oil in tx or something? I don't enjoy smoking pot, but would be interested in using cbd to treat my anxiety. 
2069 2018-06-12 19:30:08 • shower daily and apply deodorant
• apply castor oil and coconut oil to your eyebrows and eyelashes every night to make them thicker.
• apply coconut oil and almond oil on your nails every night.
• drink a glass of lemon water every morning.
2070 2018-06-12 19:30:07 Your tits are so yummy Mrs. Reds. I crave and worship them each and everyday. Oh how I dream of wrapping my lips around just to lick and suck em and oil them up and titty fuck your big yummy boobies 
2071 2018-06-12 19:30:00 With Respect; Would the First Nations Chiefs who signed the KM pipeline approval, please explain what they meant when they said, ‘their hands were tied’. & had no choice. Did the Feds threaten $ hardships? Or? U all say u do not support Dirty Oil.  Then Why? Simple Clarity pls.
2072 2018-06-12 19:29:47 • eat lots of fruit and drink enough water
• workout four times a week
• take care of your skin. cleanse, tone, moisturise, exfoliate & use face masks.
• oil your scalp 2-3 times a week. use coconut oil, castor oil and olive oil.

#OlivePassion #henrimor #healthy #oliveoil #Foodies
2077 2018-06-12 19:29:26 At 37 weeks I started doing evening primrose oil. It won’t induce labor but makes your cervix softer & move favorable for labor. I started sitting on a birthing ball as much as possible around that time too. It was my first baby & I was 4 cm at the office appt before I delivered.
2078 2018-06-12 19:29:05 he needs some tea tree oil
2079 2018-06-12 19:28:59 I'm finding this funny now. Every time he talks about this and pain, some one says "have you tried pot? or CBD oil?"
2080 2018-06-12 19:28:50 I wonder what you would say if he had put tariffs on oil and gas exports to the United States?
2081 2018-06-12 19:28:46 If you read the latest stats on emissions by oil drillers and ptocess CO’s you will see that the levels are low. It is the cars and machines, bldg’s and disposal of electronics, accumulated waste, etc. that pose bigger problems. 80% of fuel used remains fossil fuel
2082 2018-06-12 19:28:27 Try Jamaican black castor oil, castor oil and coconut oil. Mix them together and apply to the area, try not have hairstyles that pull uur
2083 2018-06-12 19:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
2084 2018-06-12 19:28:01 And "fish" oil.
2085 2018-06-12 19:27:44 @LiveKellyRyan  Ryan use coconut oil and apple cider vinegar, rub on your sunburn and it will turn to tan, works every time for my daughter!
2086 2018-06-12 19:27:40 Note to self.  Don’t put Oil in the Coolant tank by mistake !  Thank you @GreenFlagUK (Llandovery garage) for coming to the rescure.  First class, speedy help #readmanual
2087 2018-06-12 19:27:30 i heard coconut oil works great
2088 2018-06-12 19:27:24 "And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them." ~Mark 6:13 #Jesus #God #Bible
2089 2018-06-12 19:27:23 ねぇよそんなもん
2090 2018-06-12 19:27:21 Checked the oil in my car and tyre pressure 
2091 2018-06-12 19:27:00 CBD oil
2092 2018-06-12 19:26:57 Came to get my oil changed & this old ass guy staring at me while i eat ice out of my cup. 
2093 2018-06-12 19:26:33 Someone buy me an oil diffuser for my room.
2094 2018-06-12 19:26:29 No. They didn't have much flavor other than salt pepper and olive oil
2095 2018-06-12 19:26:24 OK....but don't forget that it includes oil and natural gas, electricity and a number of other raw materials.  The cost of your good will skyrocket as a result.  Also don't forget how many states depend on Canada as their largest trading partner.
2096 2018-06-12 19:26:23 
Caster oil
2097 2018-06-12 19:26:20 oil for edges !
2098 2018-06-12 19:26:04 Mental Note:

When i dont have any salad dressing on hand, olive oil, soy sauce, and maple syrup together are a good substitute.

Yeah, im wierd. 
2099 2018-06-12 19:25:41 But then you find out there are others oils doing better and even your own engineers tell you they are not gona use your oil (Swift killer banks declined to use XRP)
2100 2018-06-12 19:25:40 I absolutely hate getting oil changes by myself
2101 2018-06-12 19:25:36 Venezuela's oil export crisis originated in its fast declining crude output, which has led to a growing noncompliance with supply contracts. In May, more problems arrived with Conoco's legal actions in the Caribbean, which in June has finally turned into a giant export bottleneck
2102 2018-06-12 19:25:33 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2103 2018-06-12 19:25:33 We don’t need your oil we don’t need your water we don’t need cattle . Well maybe we need your oranges . But we have so many resources . But we always share with the USA .
2104 2018-06-12 19:25:31 I haven't really worked with water color but I have oil paint and pastels. You get the best results from oil paint it just takes days to dry. Easy to blend with tho
2105 2018-06-12 19:25:06 Now if I could find my darn baby oil... 
2106 2018-06-12 19:24:55 一生浮かんでたい
2107 2018-06-12 19:24:51 Yeah, I’ve been trying cbd oil etc, and so far hasn’t done much for migraines but it does help immensely for anxiety which is great!
2108 2018-06-12 19:24:45 Hey u guy I have started loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! Its been helping me with my anxiety so much!
2109 2018-06-12 19:24:09 Renders me speechless. Then I want to rant and laugh at it...but a question lingers. Is there form here? Has any other US president (or indeed any other world leader) used a faux movie trailer to help oil what they hope will be epoch-defining international diplomacy?
2110 2018-06-12 19:24:07 I’m mad my hair is growing out of my braids so fast like I’m not the one who has been using hair growth oil.
2111 2018-06-12 19:24:05 Yeah, probably. I've tried coconut oil and neosporin(sp?) to help with that, but he hates the texture, so he sits down and bathes himself literally until he gets it all out of his fur. It took him almost eight hours with the coconut oil. Heh.
2112 2018-06-12 19:24:01 温泉旅行って別に用意するもんないよね
2113 2018-06-12 19:23:57 You keep jumping the gun! Stick to one topic mate. Let's first deal with Islam as religion of not-peace! Then we can discuss about oil reserves, renewable energy, Indian poverty, defecating in open in 21 century, number of villages still craving for electricity, everyday rapes.
2114 2018-06-12 19:23:44 The EU doesn't decide if we allow fracking or not.
The EU doesn't decide when we should use Scotland the brand.
The EU doesn't decide how our Oil & Gas industry is abused.
The EU doesn't decide our immigration policies.
The EU isn't reneging on a plethora of promises...
2115 2018-06-12 19:23:39 lmao I know its a love/hate relationship with them mediums.. they only wanna act right sometimes  I enjoy oil pastels & watercolor & color-pencils the most tho
2116 2018-06-12 19:23:38 Ah well there it is. Nothing more than a snake oil salesman
2117 2018-06-12 19:23:28 Nah, not that organised - especially with pizza / chilli oil incident ha ha

2125 2018-06-12 19:22:48 It’s clearly a war for oil and resources! Dastardly Canadians waging war on false pretenses!
2126 2018-06-12 19:22:41 CBD oil
2127 2018-06-12 19:22:04 Season with beaten egg, then squeeze of olive oil and whisk lightly charred (keep an inch or until smooth.
2128 2018-06-12 19:21:59 No. It's like you invent oil.
You go to technicians and ask them to create an engine based on burning oil. The engineers fund a company. You give them nearly all oil to distribute this oil around the world and create value around it. And keep developing different engines.
2129 2018-06-12 19:21:48 If your girl come to Walmart to get her oil change instead of you doing it for her, you bitch made no cap. 
2130 2018-06-12 19:21:45 Being a black woman in oil and gas in Texas is exhausting. Out of all the stereotypes and facts possible, everyone wants to ignore the fact that 93% of black women ain't vote for Tr*mp.
2131 2018-06-12 19:21:16 Much of the palm oil seems to be partially hydrogenated too. Just in case it wasn't already bad enough.

2135 2018-06-12 19:20:59 You first talk about Canada being a great ally and call Kim Kong Un names and threaten his country.  Then bash our Prime Minister and threaten us with higher prices and shake hands with a brutal dictator.  What is the very greedy U.S. want from North Korea that badly?  Oil? Gold?
2136 2018-06-12 19:20:45 'Well in that case, and if this at all is in effect anywhere in mideast, you can migrate to a better governed country!'
The fun will end when oil reserves deplete and the world moves forward with renewable energy. Enjoy your prosperity for a brief moment!

2139 2018-06-12 19:20:18 Man, you are naive. US does not have to rely on our oil, and as for energy; Wynne already sold energy to the States at a loss at times, so way to go Canada. LOL If Trudeau wishes to play hardball with Trump, it's @JustinTrudeau who will be left begging.
2140 2018-06-12 19:20:10 Because of jobs in oil and gas

2145 2018-06-12 19:19:31 Tea tree oil!!! It’s a savior. Only thing that has ever helped mine!! Get you some. You won’t regret it. I got mine pierced in 2012 and it’s still a biatch sometimes, but tea tree oil always fixes it.

2152 2018-06-12 19:18:44 Have that too, assume you have peppermint oil caps
2153 2018-06-12 19:18:38 Germ of truth here in that human exhalations are not a problem because they derive from food which derives from CO2 absorbed by plants, a closed cycle.

The *machines* we *built* on the other hand, are exhaling CO2 from millions of years of oil, and in vastly larger amounts.
2154 2018-06-12 19:18:37 I used my friends oil and it is one of my favorite scents. I wanna go to the store next time I'm in NY
2155 2018-06-12 19:18:15 AH thank you it’s the avoiding fuck boys, rosehip oil and reducing stress GLOW!
2156 2018-06-12 19:18:00 The Russians proved that oil is not a fossil fuel by drilling far deeper than biotic oil could ever be created. This is not a myth or a hoax, oil and coal are not from 'fossils' or ancient plant life. Hydrocarbons form deep in the Earth.
2157 2018-06-12 19:17:54 I slather my face in oil..
2158 2018-06-12 19:17:34 Any idea how this is affecting China's oil imports? If it's a wash, they're basically spending money at home that would otherwise to abroad.
2159 2018-06-12 19:17:27 If I hear that PJR windows cheesy windows ad again I will boil myself in oil!! @Rev962
2160 2018-06-12 19:17:15 I lived in Inhofe's city when he was its mayor, then its rep, and in his state as its senator. And I've never met him. I doubt he ever rubs elbows with real people in DC, or Oklahoma. His idea of real people is oil men.
2161 2018-06-12 19:17:08 By "home" he means big oil boardrooms
2162 2018-06-12 19:17:08 I use CBD oil for anxiety and it’s working wonders so far. I’ve  partnered with @NaturesUltra because their product has treated me so well and i swear by CBD oil as a healthy alternative. If you like what you see use ALRYJAZZ15 at checkout for 15% off. Good luck

2166 2018-06-12 19:16:22 Eh it's just your hair - rinse it with hot enough water and any oil or dirt will be washed away. 
Also worth looking into - solid shampoo!
2167 2018-06-12 19:16:18 As a Veteran I fought trying Medical Cannabis for 4 years. The Biggest Mistake of my life. I have been on it since 2011 and it's gotten me off 28 different meds a day with most being taken 3 times a day or more. Medical Cannabis Oil Saved My Life.

2172 2018-06-12 19:15:40 This is indeed glorious. The Jamie Oliver command of "a good lug of oil" always makes me feel funny though.
2173 2018-06-12 19:15:35 Is Chump actively coordinating NOW with China and Russia on lucrative sweetheart deals for himself & family(ZTE, Rosneft, Chinese patents for Ivanka, steel tarrifs that benefit Russian oligarchs, UAE deals, Saudi oil deals) that give up our national security interests for $?.
2174 2018-06-12 19:15:34 According to @WOOLWORTHS_SA website, their 'exclusive recipe pies' have certified sustainable palm oil. 

That's it. Every other product using palm oil, I am imagining, has contributed to deforestation, orphaning of animals, and generally bad shit. 

Can't spin it.
2175 2018-06-12 19:15:26 Just claim kenyan sis, I’ve had enough… but Yh I’ll bring you some on eid. And the oil you’re on about is melted ghee xxx
2176 2018-06-12 19:15:10 Love the sun but it’s not so keen on the scar I have on my right cheek Which I got from being hit with a golf club when I was a kid, it looks terrible tonight! Tried bio oil on it nae danger doesn’t work! it will take a few skin grafts to fade it

2178 2018-06-12 19:14:48 My boss a whole hoe for going to oil up without even needing to, we could’ve been done by 3:30.... now he gonna have us out here forever
2179 2018-06-12 19:14:37 My go to is zinsser all coat if white or black. Still use super Dec, and also oil based santex. Just wanted opinions on the above as these seem to be the leaders at the minute in w/b but I’ve never used their products externally.
2180 2018-06-12 19:14:33 I’m literally getting a free massage while my car is getting a tire rotation and oil change (also free) and a (also free) car wash and vacuum. Did I mention this is all free of charge? Ugh my mind 
2181 2018-06-12 19:14:18 Ran across a major fire just outside of Mineola KS. Appears to be oil related.
2182 2018-06-12 19:13:59 People, union or otherwise are sick of big oil. Electric cars are one generation away from taking over. WWC are pretty set in their ways. Whether they continue to vote against their interests is up to them. They are more fragile re:racial tension.
2183 2018-06-12 19:13:50 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
2184 2018-06-12 19:13:36 Not saying the response hasn't been awful. ("But it's hard to get there." If they had oil, we could have a soldier on every corner in 24 hours.) & it's Trumps's ball to drop now. But the infrastructure decay has been a long time coming & we must resolve that to really fix things.
2185 2018-06-12 19:13:27 I use CBD oil for aches, pains and anxiety and it working wonders. I’ve partnered with @NaturesUltra because their product has treated me so well. If you like what you see use ALRYJAZZ15 at checkout for 15% off. Good luck

2189 2018-06-12 19:12:45 Ah the Underground!! Visions of replicating the delights of London at home. Noisy and that unique pong of oil, grease and sweat that never changes. Still like that when I was over last year.

2192 2018-06-12 19:12:27 Anyone got any good oil memes?
2193 2018-06-12 19:12:22 you think an oil change isn’t boring?

2195 2018-06-12 19:12:11 Nice! I got eliminated on the oil tanker question today. How'd you do?
2196 2018-06-12 19:11:58 Hey F&B @frankienbennys #notcool Very impressed with allergy policy (nuts) & the service in Belfast, however its NOT cool that you advertise Mushroom Burger with fries as Vegetarian when the fries are cooked in the same oil as all other products, including chicken, meat, nuts!
2197 2018-06-12 19:11:56 If all you’ve had is painkillers, get some caffeine in you. The caffeine is crucial.

After caffeine, get some peppermint tea or use peppermint oil, go lay down in a dark room with a cold washcloth over the eyes.

Get yourself extra hydrated. Make sure you get rest and sleep.
2198 2018-06-12 19:11:52 right now i’m in the bath i put some weird bath oil in after drinking like half a bottle of rescue remedy; self care :)
2199 2018-06-12 19:11:52 Any tips for both oil and dry skin?
2200 2018-06-12 19:11:45 Wild growth oil, or argon oil
2201 2018-06-12 19:11:41 Agree. Are you thinking oil output linked bonds or price? For other countries latter would make sense as effectively they are a play on revenue , for vennie output might be important and is a real source of divergent views in inv/policy community.
2202 2018-06-12 19:11:38 @HQTriviaHelp the military vessel vs oil tanker was a poor question. Either way, an aircraft carrier has more tonnage than a tanker. They should be listed when empty. Thanks
2203 2018-06-12 19:11:34 or, another (and probably more common) reason for the bumps is an allergy to the cleaning solution they use for the tanning beds/or a specific oil left behind from another customer if not cleaned well enough 
2204 2018-06-12 19:11:29 My talents are wasted. Air filter changed and oil filter change in progress...

2206 2018-06-12 19:11:04 You brought it in for an oil change, but we decided to replace:
- the transmission
- the fan belt
- the radiator fan
- the carburetor 
- the alternator

That’s cool, right?
2207 2018-06-12 19:11:03 The Salmond report, as in the white paper?

2208 2018-06-12 19:11:03 You would know about hate. I didn't vote for anyone thinking first about how doing so would hurt you. 
Nope, I thought of someone who looked out for the many, not TRUMP who looks at just how to extort $ from foreign governments for personally enriching hotel and oil deals

2214 2018-06-12 19:10:22 Did you add like 2 tbsp of oil and like 1/3 cup of water as well? You probably just needed more liquid if anything

2226 2018-06-12 19:09:21 Hey. Thanks Mumbi for the tag. Sorry about your scalp @Atetwee. You can relieve it by doing a cleanse with bentonite clay and apple cider vinegar, then applying some eucalyptus oil or peppermint oil mixed with another oil /butter on the scalp.

2228 2018-06-12 19:09:12 Heh. A few years ago Texas was converting paved roads to gravel, because they decided to give all the money to pave them to the oil companies. Won't look for anything like this any time soon.

2235 2018-06-12 19:08:24 One of the places North Korea gets oil and perhaps other things is Russia. So, for me, the why of all of this is obvious. I don't think Russia expects Trump to actually get anything done. They just want him to damage the country's reputation. Which he has done and then some.

2239 2018-06-12 19:08:04 Its gonna cost them a lot more than $2 to replace the oil and sanitize the fryer when someone decides to poop in it.
2240 2018-06-12 19:07:59 Russia, his sponsor, is in the oil business big time. Trump is in the money laundering business. Real estate can help move monies around.

2307 2018-06-12 18:59:29 My apologies if my reply came across as a bit harsh.  It's just that it can be frustrating when you are trying to eat healthy and it turns out that maybe you're not!  Personally I have bought the occasional bottle of cold pressed grapeseed oil thinking it was a good thing.
2308 2018-06-12 18:59:22 i tried using natural deodorants for a while but i think i’m going to switch back because the naturals leave oil(?) stains and it’s annoying

2311 2018-06-12 18:58:58 Apparently you know nothing about Asian culture or doing business with them. 
This was a MAJOR step. It's all about the dance over there.
2312 2018-06-12 18:58:54 Ooo what oil cleansing products would you recommend?
2313 2018-06-12 18:58:46 Don’t think your ownership extends down far enough to tap mineral reserves in case you were hoping to become an oil baron 

Pretty sure they’re not allowed to undermine your land, bit like if you cut down branches overhanging your property you must return them to the neighbour.
2314 2018-06-12 18:58:46 So I know I said I wasn’t interested in selling my first fruit study oil on wood panel painting, which is now also coated in resin. But I actually am, ONLY if the right buyer comes along who is respectful of my asking price. I spent almost 23 hrs on it, so yes it is a bit pricey.

2324 2018-06-12 18:57:36 Yay oil change done
2325 2018-06-12 18:57:25 The refining process of EVOO makes it more flavorful, but burns faster. Olive oil prime is more for cooking. EVOO is better as a topping or low heat cooking, or like coating pasta. If im wrong please don’t @ me, pedants.
2326 2018-06-12 18:57:21 Heh @realDonaldTrump says he will punish Canada. Maybe he should google where a lot of US water, oil and electricity come from and what you pay for it. Bring it on, you need us and @JustinTrudeau more than you realize. Wonder if we can press charges for threats??
2327 2018-06-12 18:56:49 And at the same time maybe Canada should turn off the tap to the oil and flick the switch to the electricity that the US loves to gobble up. Goes both ways. Think.
2328 2018-06-12 18:56:36 China simply needs to keep buying Iranian oil. We'll see if they do.
2329 2018-06-12 18:56:36 On the upside, by accessing gov't #Renewables tax breaks and direct subsidies for "investment" in #Wind and #Solar, the #Greenies can now accurately claim an oil company gets a subsidy...

2352 2018-06-12 18:53:00 So should this really start to esculate I think we need to hit back, this sounds like a plan. Hydro and oil that we export to the states could we do something there? Free trade trade among the prov's? We need to be creative because if we want to survive.

2399 2018-06-12 18:47:10 Dealerships are generally more expensive.  Dealerships often try to up sell services too. Find a competent professional mechanic with a good reputation. Ask around.  Oil changes are best done at places where that’s all they do.  Don’t bother your mechanic with simple stuff.

2406 2018-06-12 18:46:11 Tho can argue that US is importing oil from Canada in part to export product, so what matters to the US is the spread (and bilateral data to a degree misleads as gross oil imports exceed net).

US trade balance with oil exporters tho does naturally swing with oil price.
2407 2018-06-12 18:46:10 IIRC it was something about the chemicals they use to extract the oil from the plants that was particularly nasty? But I can't remember the details...

2421 2018-06-12 18:44:11 Hey @SmartMouthPod, real Q: what’s the difference between extra virgin olive oil and regular olive oil? Just came across my first recipe requiring the latter, but I haven’t noticed any non-virginal OO’s in most grocery stores these days.
2422 2018-06-12 18:44:06 @mattbai Hey Matt...looking forward to your thoughts re: the NK summit. Just a question, if Trudeau really wants to get under Trumps skin, is it possible for Canada to set a 25% tariff on every barrel of oil coming through their country from AK? Or turn it off and let him wiggle?

2431 2018-06-12 18:42:34 olives r good when olives dont taste like olive oil
2432 2018-06-12 18:42:32 A $40bn deficit in 2017 is still significant. And remember that was with the crude oil price at $50 a barrel. Canada exports 1.5 billion barrels per year south, so every $10 on the oil price adds another $15bn to the deficit. (That's a very rough calc though!)
2433 2018-06-12 18:42:29 Today I spotted a truck that was delivering palm oil for cooking to a Chinese restaurant I like. It broke my heart and I won’t go there again...#NotoPalmOil #PalmOil
2434 2018-06-12 18:42:14 i think i ended up using diluted tea tree oil and garlic powder, because it was what i had around and my local pharmacies inexplicably had nothin' for me under $30.

2436 2018-06-12 18:42:03 How long have uu been using the coconut oil
2437 2018-06-12 18:42:01 I would have told him on my way out to the store “I better not find no damn olive oil in that store!” Just like a mad mom since he wanna be a dumb child 
2438 2018-06-12 18:41:48 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.

2440 2018-06-12 18:41:46 Right so if the world bank lends money to Cameroon or some other African country, so it develops and starts to need oil, it's not the fault of the World bank?
2441 2018-06-12 18:41:40 has been fairly persistent though.  until there is a lot more export (e.g. pipeline) capacity to one of Canada's coasts, the US will get a good deal on Canadian oil ...

especially as our refiners have the capacity to handle the heavy stuff
2442 2018-06-12 18:41:28 Baaabe You can even get coconut oil.. 100% pure. I just love it. it’s a pleasure friendeee

2445 2018-06-12 18:40:55 Yes, so if you want to import oil from Saudi Arabia you will have to buy that oil in USD. If you want USD you need to go to the US and sell some of your stuff. The US, in order to pay for that stuff prints USD. That's the deal. China works, US enjoys...

2448 2018-06-12 18:40:47 My mom consistently calls cannabis oil “cannibal oil”
2449 2018-06-12 18:40:46 Unemployment may be down, but that won't help when everything you want to buiy costs too much. You can thank the king of snake oil salesmen, Don the Con.
2450 2018-06-12 18:40:42 I'm shocked at the sheer number of people who don't understand that cbd oil and cannabis oil (the latter being the medicine used in these high profile epilepsy cases) are completely different. This needs clearer marketing. Urgently.
2451 2018-06-12 18:40:37 El Juez Julián Ercolini elevó a juicio oral y público la causa contra Cristóbal López, Fabián De Sousa y Ricardo Echegaray por el delito de defraudación agravada a través de su petrolera Oil Combustibles. Marche ya un brindis desde esta cuenta para todos mis seguidores 
2452 2018-06-12 18:40:15 China wants to control trade through the South China Sea. It’s among the busiest trade routes in the world, if not the biggest. There’s also oil reserves there that China does not want to share with her neighbors who also have valid claims to the same sea.

2457 2018-06-12 18:39:29 Paper 3 of #edexcelgeography #gcse was lovely! Love a bit of topical palm oil 
2458 2018-06-12 18:39:19 I also think this and pulling out of Iran treaty was about increasing oil per barrel..Russia, Saudis and UAE need high prices to sustain the corruption.

2461 2018-06-12 18:38:50 Trying to be an adult and take my car to get an oil change, while simultaneously having a panic attack about it
2462 2018-06-12 18:38:39 Before you watch the news or read a newspaper repeat this sentence "Industry does not care about human lives. Bankers are oil traders. There is no failure in politics, just succes with or without respect."
2463 2018-06-12 18:38:36 “Holy Fuck Bubs! That new hash oil has me feeling different!” “That’s cuz it turned us into pugs!”
2464 2018-06-12 18:38:28 No we don’t, oil companies do. If you were actually a Canadian you’d know this.
2465 2018-06-12 18:38:26 Have to get oil changed today :^( the valvoline is in the middle of nowhereeeee but I can get sbuxx on the way home at least.. then crack down on some drawing stuff

2469 2018-06-12 18:38:15 friendly reminder to check your fluids, oil and coolant, as well as tire pressure before traveling this summer.
2470 2018-06-12 18:38:09 What ever new system we come up with for a global economy. It must include a component for human genius an invention. A large chunk of the economy is just ideas that come from ppl's mind. No gold or oil can account for that.
2471 2018-06-12 18:38:01 The U.S isn't even on the top ten nations that China imports oil from. It's Saudi Arabia. So yes China is to blame for its own CO2 emissions.
2472 2018-06-12 18:37:53 Anyone who watches Ben's show expecting optimism may equally expect vinegar to be oil. Go watch Klavan if you want "tickety-boo," or Fox if you want everlasting Trump adulation.
2473 2018-06-12 18:37:37 Great so when NK drops out Russia will still provide them with oil while they continue their nuclear build up

I said he could probably drive his truck for a year without an oil change but it’s not a great idea 
2476 2018-06-12 18:37:03 1.I don't shampoo every time when i shower
2.Use cold-water rinse at the end of each shower.
3.Apply an oil  treatment weekly.

2478 2018-06-12 18:36:39 yummmy baby , @Christianlord12! I have a recipe for baked fetus that you should try. Marinade it in an olive oil and balsamic vinegar dressing for 8+ hours, then bake that dude in the oven at 350 degrees for 2 1/2 hours or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Enjoy!
2479 2018-06-12 18:36:35 yooo I just realized that coconuts are taking over my life. I use coconut shampoo and conditioner, I drink coconut coffee with coconut milk creamer and coconut sugar, I drink hella coconut water, I use a coconut oil based serum in my hair, and my air freshener is a coconut scent
2480 2018-06-12 18:36:24 I could be wrong, this could all be some Putin directive to create a war so he can sell arms and oil... but I really don't think Putin would want to be the catalyst for a war so close to the Russian border.
2481 2018-06-12 18:36:20 It's just like boiling water and meeting engine oil there 
2482 2018-06-12 18:36:20 The use of palm oil as fuel is wiping out the natural environment in those countries that grow it.  The import of palm oil should be stopped.
2483 2018-06-12 18:36:05 So today I was tasked with taking the ultrasound oil off the patient’s leg and turning the shock wave machine on and off ... EXCITING!!

2491 2018-06-12 18:34:39 I agree in general. Although to be honest it's often very difficult to construct a meaningful narrative targeted at, eg sales, that they won't warp into snake oil sometimes.
2492 2018-06-12 18:34:37 fixed income investors don't like the extra volatility that would come with commodity linkage?  just a guess ...

am hoping oil linked bonds emerge out of the Vennie restructuring.  think they make more sense than GDP liniked bonds for a lot of countries.
2493 2018-06-12 18:34:34 Personally I cut meat out first, then dairy and eggs that I could actually see (cheese, milk, Alfredo sauce...) and then products with dairy in them that you can’t “see” and have to read the ingredients list for (non-vegan chips, baked goods, products with fish oil in them, etc)

2496 2018-06-12 18:34:25 Now that the country is standing for the Dairy and Auto buisness....hmm makes you think about the Oil workers and how little if anything the government did for us. I said us cause I am a proud oilfield worker that has persevered
2497 2018-06-12 18:34:22 Don’t forget the people in this country who actually produce things in forestry, mining, manufacturing, oil and gas etc... without them public servants wouldn’t even be needed.
2498 2018-06-12 18:33:55 Dealership driver pegged me for an Esks fan instead of an Oilers fan.

Once I clarified, we had a nice chat. He thinks McDavid will lead the Oil to a 6-Cup dynasty.

Damn. What a perspective. No social media taint, no concern for off-ice moves...

Made me smile. Hope he’s right.

It could have been a donor to Anti Oil activity in Canada and none of you care.
2515 2018-06-12 18:32:07 Cannabis oil works great for anxiety and mood boosting. You can get oils without thc so there’s no high. It’s a game changer
2516 2018-06-12 18:32:06 Or the lowest unemployment rate in history.. the lowest female unemployment rate in history.. an the lowest African American and Mexican unemployment rate in history... or the stock market.. or oil coming back! Things are great! You just chose to blindly hate the man!
2517 2018-06-12 18:31:58 Massaging Jamaican black castor oil (along with tea tree oil, argan oil) into your scalp or target area, and taking biotin tablets, it might help it worked for me.

2522 2018-06-12 18:31:31 You can't industrialize without a market. That was the US. To get there you needed oil, which was allocated to China by the US. So lets not call anyone a moron its uncivilized..

2528 2018-06-12 18:31:01 So fuel margin oscillates in limited range, while Applegreen enjoys tailwind frm increasing scale/fuel terminal acq'n. Though clrly a rising oil price is a headwind as per latest RNS, bt not so serious in context of 20-25%+ grwth trajectory & noting fuel's jst 37% of gross profit

2555 2018-06-12 18:28:42 And that's for a liter, not a gallon, if I'm not mistaken.  Bro, we are fortunate to have oil reserves and that we export oil.
2556 2018-06-12 18:28:39 Flooding is indeed a bad thing. Perhaps we could help by eliminating other fluids like crude oil coming from Canada?
2557 2018-06-12 18:28:34 I could the basics on my Chevy S-15.  Change battery and alternator, oil and fluids.  Tires.

Newer cars are harder to self manage sometimes though.

2564 2018-06-12 18:27:50 No one should forget that Sweden once lost Finland to Russia. And that until 1917 Finland was owned by Russia and during that time was known as the Grand Duchy of Finland. 

And. Norway has oil.
2565 2018-06-12 18:27:41 i’m getting my oil changed and i already know they’re gonna try to make me do more to my car
2566 2018-06-12 18:27:35 My point exactly. Same type of dudes same results. Grown men dont have time for that. Maybe expand yourself and stop going to the gym so dam much. Muscles aint eveything.  Most them niggas built but cant change your oil. Lame throw the whole man away.
2567 2018-06-12 18:27:29 Whatever, that’s still better than someone owned by the NRA, big oil and big pharma. I mean, it would really be horrible if we could all have health insurance, breathe clean air, and be paid a living wage, wouldn’t it?
2568 2018-06-12 18:27:28 Judging by their drop in oil production, I'd say Venezuela's fall is imminent.

2587 2018-06-12 18:26:02 Isn’t it amazing... North Korea shows proof to the world they have WMD + NO Oil = peaceful handshakes in Singapore... Arab country NO proof of WMD + Oil Rich = War + innocent people dying, total destruction of civilization etc. Why is Kim any different to Saddam?? Can you answer?

2589 2018-06-12 18:25:48 Instead of the Niger - Delta people to spread development and plan a life after the oil boom, they are busy stealing. Same with the Igbos.
2590 2018-06-12 18:25:43 I wish I could exercise without using my cannabis oil but unfortunately fibromyalgia keeps me in agony unable to move my body the way I want to. It makes me even more depressed when I can't exercise or do the things I want feeling trapped in pain

Or was it the Marfan Syndrome, snake oil salesman, Tony Robbins, that you’ve been crapper reading, give you your epiphany? Asking 4 a friend.
2592 2018-06-12 18:25:27 So in effect you're going to prove him right? 
Tariffs are only taxes on Citizens, and tough talk bad if an American President does It?

2598 2018-06-12 18:24:42 Stop enabling drugs and homelessness. More money (oil) you pour on to it (fire), it attracts more. Also it’s never been about homelessness anyway. It’s all about that money  
2599 2018-06-12 18:24:40 Let's start with all the lies. only plays or care for his base. made himself and his entire family even richer with the big tax scam and. Though back door deals and loans from  foreign countries. selling off our national parks to be raped by the oil company's.
2600 2018-06-12 18:24:34 Yes definitely so! In the last blog post @genomickitchen we talked about how the Mediterranean diet strikes up a convo with your genes! Starts with great olive oil . . Herbs . . Greens and roots. Very intriguing.
2601 2018-06-12 18:24:32 Theres no feeling like giving an abused car the tender love and oil change it rightfully deserves. She wont hurt you no more
2602 2018-06-12 18:24:23 Oriflame yg cleansing oil. Ato gak biore cleansing oil yg warnanya ungu.
2603 2018-06-12 18:24:17 A quick saute in avacado oil / butter would be good.
We don't like them if they get too old, as get kind of tough.
2604 2018-06-12 18:24:05 Correct me if I am wrong but does that figure include just 8.9% of oil revenues?
2605 2018-06-12 18:23:59 Anyone who claims to be liberal and is against Iran under western media’s lies when they dont disclose that it is about oil.. you are not a liberal.. just cuz you are anti trump the way colbert is... doesnt mean shit to me
2606 2018-06-12 18:23:59 It appears @glossier reads my tweets and just formulates whatever I want so like idk maybe a glittery lip gloss and a face oil would be tight af
2607 2018-06-12 18:23:52 FYI--Rosehip oil. On yer face.  All I'm sayin'. #trustme #benjaminbutton

2609 2018-06-12 18:23:26 I love coconut oil but I learned my lesson lol my face looks like a 12 year old right now with the amount of break outs I got from it 
2610 2018-06-12 18:23:24 Specifically fracking in search of oil...
2611 2018-06-12 18:23:23 Yes, I imagine it’ll do the exact same. Or coconut oil also vg x
2612 2018-06-12 18:23:18 Well the going to war over oil hasn't faded anywhere near enough.

Remind me again who was propping up Saddam Hussein before he became the evil dictator again?
2613 2018-06-12 18:23:13 I wanted to see if I could check my oil last week & I did it successfully! I’m a mechanic now 
2614 2018-06-12 18:23:04 See Jonathan building Centenary City in Abuja without planning on how to build an Iil City for the Niger - Delta where the oil is from.
2615 2018-06-12 18:22:42 Unbelievable! @marksandspencer you should follow @IcelandFoods on their pledge to have no plastic packaging and no palm oil on their shops!
2616 2018-06-12 18:22:35 An oil furnace can be completely recycled, very little plastic and made into another furnace or bicycle, if you do the analysis of your $4.5 billion in solar panels and let say that is installed on every govt bldg, where do you get power when the sun isn't shineing or winter?
2617 2018-06-12 18:22:34 Consumers ridiculously over-exaggerate fuel pricing power....in reality, it's mostly pass-through pricing, with some expansion/contraction in margins depending on oil prices/trajectory. Applegreen's fuel margin has expanded from 4.65% in 2012-13 to 5.8% in 2016-2017.
2618 2018-06-12 18:22:31 The coconut oil worked like a dream lol but for a week it was driving me crazy
2619 2018-06-12 18:22:28 Geraldo, please Canada is no freind of the USA and they have been a leach to our economy as long as i can remember. I am old enough to remember the 1972’s So called “Arab” oil embargo, however the only country that shut off the US by the law of the land was Canada! nationalistic!
2620 2018-06-12 18:22:18 Eh, China had to buy oil on a US dominated world market in USD. So the only  reason China has grown is because the US let it happen. And yes, Reagan is to blame, he had the right information and the ability to decide to stop the catastophy. Science was ready, he killed it.
2621 2018-06-12 18:22:13 I want you to do some research. Look at what oil is doing to Oklahoma. They used have 2-5 earthquakes per yer. As of 2016 they have nearly 600 that are DIRECTLY related to oil digging and petroleum waste destruction of sewer systems causing the earthquakes. You people..
2622 2018-06-12 18:22:12 That's not balsamic vinegar or cooking oil in that case is it?
2623 2018-06-12 18:21:56 He’s Agenda driven, oil tycoon billionaire funded/sponsored...  just follow the paper trail

2627 2018-06-12 18:21:34 Sooooo easy to do. Use coconut oil instead of ghee.
2628 2018-06-12 18:21:32 Kikikikikikikikiiiiii,  you need prayers & plenty anointing oil 
2629 2018-06-12 18:21:25 Oil is a massive diplomatic incentive for a fossil fuel dependent nation.
Trump doesn't care about diplomacy - he just needs to be the big man on campus... YAY "DEMOCRACY"

2632 2018-06-12 18:21:02 @NickHurdUK Please return Billy's cannabis oil. There's grace and honour in relenting to a heartfelt plea from a mum. Thanks.
2633 2018-06-12 18:20:42 Radical? Combatting an existential threat, climate change? Keeping coal sludge out of rivers? Keeping dangerous pesticides off the market? Making rules to prevent another deep water oil blowout (and ruin many of LA's businesses)?
2634 2018-06-12 18:20:15 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This June, read labels carefully.
2635 2018-06-12 18:20:12 so uhhhhh my mom ordered me CBD oil bro what

2638 2018-06-12 18:19:18 In 2016 investors spent 2x+ more on renewables than on oil gas coal and nuclear combined say IEA. $297bn v $143bn What do markets know that #Trump doesn’t?

2647 2018-06-12 18:18:04 Roasted cauliflower = best replacement for Sunday Roast Chicken #vegan @BBCTheOneShow #sundayroast

Just a tablespoon of oil, a teaspoon of paprika and a pinch of salt (adjust amounts accordingly) and in the oven for half an hour. 
2648 2018-06-12 18:17:51 For real! I just use macadamia or almond oil to take off my makeup with micellar water and my skin has thanked me for it.
2649 2018-06-12 18:17:38 No oil for you lady... but here is a shitload of opiates to keep the symptoms at bay !
2650 2018-06-12 18:17:34 Never send a man to the store to get something he's never actually used before.  It won't end well.

But I don't think dude even went to the store to come back with that excuse.  Grocery stores don't run out of olives, olive oil, or olives in oil.
2651 2018-06-12 18:17:20 @philandalex coming from insta for Phil. I am Canadian, living in central AB where the gas/oil comes from. It is $1.26/L right now. The high price comes from a mix of carbon tax & import fees since we sell to USA/other places and buy it back for more.
2652 2018-06-12 18:17:16 Some of those are pretty wild. They hold a lot of oil so when it goes up as fuel it’s bound to be exciting.
2653 2018-06-12 18:16:55 Kung pwede lang sanang gamutin ng efficascent oil yung puso nilaklak ko na sana ung isang bote.
2654 2018-06-12 18:16:09 Oil? Dubai is broke, it sells everything to Abu Dhabi, example: Burj Dubai, when bought Abu Dhabi changed it to Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab is also owned by Abu Dhabi. The Marina skyscrapers are owned by people not from Dubai.
2655 2018-06-12 18:16:08 Don't you think Putin's behind all of this? He needs trump in office to stop sanctions which would tank his economy, he wants a new world order w/Russia leading dictators & strongmen, & he can complete an oil pipeline to North Korea. Brexit, weakened NATO & G7; wins for Putin.
2656 2018-06-12 18:16:04 It’s amazing how much happier a car with oil in it sounds to one that has virtually none...  #thedipstickwasclean

2658 2018-06-12 18:15:57 @4realz5 you will be happy to know it originated in 1950s as "love oil" haha
2659 2018-06-12 18:15:48 time and again / an avaricious oil baron / a murky past / proactive approach to life / cleavages /
2660 2018-06-12 18:15:41 They went in to get the oil. Now Trump wants to be friends with North Korea and Russia. Great leaders there! They don't kill their citizens at all. Trump is not a leader, is is an elected dictator.
2661 2018-06-12 18:15:23 You should have replied “Wrong! That’s Scotland’s oil reserve.” 
2662 2018-06-12 18:15:05 Que Oil ? Vamos juntas esta noche directam.  Ahora unos mates .. jaja
2663 2018-06-12 18:15:05 I want to start oil painting pero ang mahal ng materials mamumulubi ako

Westminster has near bankrupted an oil rich UK,300BILLION so dont give me that crap,the questions are easily answered and if answered honestly they make a mockery of the union and its supporters,as you know of course
2665 2018-06-12 18:14:41 Grape seed oil is great.... for massage
2666 2018-06-12 18:14:15 Port of Darwin in foreign hands.
Vital power infrastructure in foreign hands.
The nuts and bolts day to day running of the government farmed out to foreign owned companies. 
Defense hardware foreign made.
100% fuel oil imported from foreign countries on foreign ships.
2667 2018-06-12 18:14:12 Gah I wanna do laundry but I have this plastic bag on my head for coconut oil. Do not wanna be seen either alsifkdke
2668 2018-06-12 18:14:02 Saudi Arabia led coalition force bombs and killed civilians, who held them accountable? USA invasion of Iraqi was in error, did they pay for it? but end up stealing their crude oil. Italy kill so many refugees on sea,  who will sue them? Isreal ongoing massacre an many more...
2669 2018-06-12 18:14:01 Then again now might be the right time?
If you fear tariffs will drive up prices, likely this will impact supply/demad.
Cash for Clunkers impacted market for years.
2670 2018-06-12 18:13:52 Iraqi #Oil Minister said that #Iraq has reconstructed and opened an oil pipeline that stretches between Kirkuk, Baiji.
The 180-km pipeline has the capacity to transport more than 40K barrels per day and will supply fuel to generate electricity for areas in northern Baghdad
2671 2018-06-12 18:13:46 Resource colonialism, geostrategic considerations, etc....  Can't extract congolese wealth w/out Mobutu, can't have american oil companies in indonesia without fascist governments deposing socialists ( e;g exxonmobil, read "Private empire" 4 more details)
2672 2018-06-12 18:13:42 So I’m with my 50 y/o tia and she talks about how back in the day they used to mix coca-cola wit oil to use to tan... when my family looked at eachother and started laughing I asked as a joke if I could try it she said “idk the sun was different back then” WHAT

2675 2018-06-12 18:13:20 Where's the butter and coconut oil?
2676 2018-06-12 18:13:20 I don’t like coming to get oil changes.

2693 2018-06-12 18:10:44 Went to autozone with my gift card to get oil and a filter. get to the counter and it turns out that it’s an advanced auto gift card. I buy it anyways and get home to realize I got the wrong oil... what is wrong with me today??
2694 2018-06-12 18:10:32 There is already loads of inflation in the system from the massive expansion of credit over last 40 years.  It's going to take a while to deflate it all.  US inflation scenario might be world dumping US$ for oil trade ...all those $ would flood the US economy.
2695 2018-06-12 18:10:28 It's very simple, either you sell crude oil, or you sell refined products and benefit from the added value and your guaranteed customers.

2706 2018-06-12 18:08:09 Typical absorption of pills, edibles and oils range from as little as 6% to 33% as they go through the digestive tract. Since CanaGel is placed inside the cheek the oil is being absorbed by the oral mucosal and therefore, is immediately absorbed into the bloodstream!

2710 2018-06-12 18:07:15 Did you see the look on Japan’s Abe’s face during G7? He knows there is no hope for help on the coming China Sea Oil War. 
Now this. Once DT pulls US troops from Korea, the north can invade the south. China & Russia will ensure we are busy elsewhere.
2711 2018-06-12 18:07:03 Exactly. Russia's only resources are oil & Mafia. Both do well in uncertain times, times of war. Putin is well-pleased with Trumps work this week at G7 and in Singapore.
2712 2018-06-12 18:07:00 With 70% of electricity in Hawaii coming from oil, it makes sense to find other renewable ways of creating energy.  They are second only to Alaska in cost of electricity, but they're going over the deep end with the carbon mantra & need to deal with real social problems.

In return for not pressing charges, I paid him cash, gave him a public handjob & he promised to send his crew back tomorrow.  I think I deserve the Neighborhood Peace Prize.
2718 2018-06-12 18:06:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2719 2018-06-12 18:05:53 I liked having a spare pair of goggles handy in case the first pair have become "bespattered with oil and dust".  I can't remember the last time anyone complained about being "bespattered" by anything.  Awesome post.
2720 2018-06-12 18:05:51 I can’t remember the last time I went for an oil change and it was just an oil change.

2722 2018-06-12 18:05:46 They don't want tar sands oil. There are different reasons for blocking that. For one it's very corrosive and part of it is the greenies hate it.

2724 2018-06-12 18:05:36 does anyone else get anxiety when your dad tells you that you need to get your oil changed? bc i do
2725 2018-06-12 18:05:31 ...like the Mullahs who organized a revolution to throw out the dictator that WE installed there. We caused the Iranian Revolution after we had utterly destroyed their democratic way of life under Mossadegh. All for oil money...

2728 2018-06-12 18:05:23 I got PureKana mint CBD oil and the first few weeks I thought it wasn’t doing anything. Then I started noticing my resting heart rate was about 10-15bpm lower every time I checked it. All the nervous thoughts are still there but my body is much calmer. I think it’s worth a try
2729 2018-06-12 18:05:20 #LetsTweetCBD #Sweepstakes #CBDoil  Again, napping. I homeschool my kids, so ANY time I get alone, is stress relieving.  My cbd oil has helped my overall anxiety.

2731 2018-06-12 18:05:09 Hey, Wolf Blitzer, how about the US creating jobs to fix American #infrastructure like roads, and creating jobs to harvest solar and wind power instead of giving money to people fighting for oil and fossil fuels?

2734 2018-06-12 18:04:32 CBD oil sounds like a drink for a car. And I like cars! I’m not as fast as a car, so who am I to judge?

2736 2018-06-12 18:04:11 Bro, go to the store...get tomatoes, cilantro, purple onion, jalapeno, mince garlic in oil, lime. Make hot sauce but put alot of onion in it. It will dry it out.

2743 2018-06-12 18:03:31 It happened again. I just had, not only a craving for, but the sense memory of the taste and feel in my mouth of those little banana-shaped hard candies you get out of a machine at oil change places. I’m sure I haven’t eaten one this century. My madeleine
2744 2018-06-12 18:03:25 That time of year I got bit by little tiny bugs I can't see and then I itch intensely. Then I go buy lemongrass oil, unscented lotion, lavender, rose, vanilla, & smell like a bouquet of flowers to keep them away. Of course then the bees &  butterflies start swarming! Can't win!
2745 2018-06-12 18:03:20 But what about olive oil?
2746 2018-06-12 18:03:19 Changed the oil in their car.
2747 2018-06-12 18:03:18 Not that affordable anymore, it used to be but price hikes a number of years ago due to 'oil prices'  cost a lot. Our Brittany ferry is about €1300, IrFerries were 1600 and a friend is flying for 1550. Advantage is we have our car obviously, they have to hire.
2748 2018-06-12 18:03:13 Hammer away trump! This excuse for a man...never mind a Prime Minister, needs some slapping around. Then maybe Canadians will start standing up for themselves! We let #Hussein and #Pedowood trash our oil export, all the while becoming a leading exporter of oil.

2750 2018-06-12 18:02:59 lol I remember once I ate at an ihop while coated from head to toe in baby oil. My friends were laughing the whole time. The waitress was more than a little weirded out I think xD

2758 2018-06-12 18:02:17 It’s really easy, and I use rotini wheels and about half the can of paste. The rosemary/chili flake oil on top is what really makes it. I think we’ve had it for dinner 10+ times since I discovered it...

Can't have people nationalizing their oil supply and giving the money to the people. That would cut into the profit of the leftist totalitarians that think they run the world.

2761 2018-06-12 18:02:07 The #Saudi economy grew by 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 and has pulled itself out of a recession due to the oil price increase. The government are expecting a 2018 shortfall of $52 billion down from the $260 billion deficit of 2014.
2762 2018-06-12 18:01:55 I need an oil change.
2763 2018-06-12 18:01:33 I’m using cbd oil at the moment, started about 4 wks ago. It’s so expensive at the mo but it’s helping
2764 2018-06-12 18:01:29 We advise storing the serums in the refrigerator or in a dark, cool environment after use in order to slow down any oxidation. Our Pure line, such as the Argan Oil, Squalane Oil, and Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure do not require refrigeration.
2765 2018-06-12 18:01:21 Oh my word! Thanks so much. I'm super excited to try this oil! #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
2766 2018-06-12 18:01:13 Yes, BC wants oil, but not tar sands oil.

2769 2018-06-12 18:00:55 And Repthugs like to watch the rich get richer with coal and oil while they work the mines and oil fields never realizing they are being used, all so they can stick it to the libs, it’s hysterical madness!!

2775 2018-06-12 18:00:33 Exactly...and how come people are not asking how on earth they're getting oil from a grapeseed! Could it be they only recently perfected the chemical refinement? Can anyone shed light some light?
2776 2018-06-12 18:00:31 I agree.
2777 2018-06-12 18:00:31 Robert, we presume you're arguing in favour of biofuels from palm oil here? You seem to have been doing that a lot of late as well as promoting the highly controversial Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil scheme. And in aviation, large-scale biofuels would likely mean palm oil.
2778 2018-06-12 18:00:29 I’m so happy, I didn’t have any breakage of shedding when I colored my hair and it’s holding oil so well..
2779 2018-06-12 18:00:24 Job killing? Why don’t we see if solar, indeed all alternatives, can actually stand on their own? With oil at $60 plus per bbl it might!

2785 2018-06-12 18:00:06 CA's "fuel blend" reqt's forbid importation of gas or oil from outside CA (Commerce clause, much?). No new refineries in 45 years means constant scarcity and shortages. Oh and, our blends yield 15-20% LOWER mpg than neighboring States but are only minimally cleaner.

2824 2018-06-12 17:55:40 Take a big jar and fill it with peeled garlic and cover the garlic in olive oil. In 2-3 days in the fridge the oil will be a greenish infusion so dank it will make anything taste beautiful. Throw those garlic cloves into everything you cook.

2937 2018-06-12 17:43:14 I can't stop.  Oil production up!  From that low point of 5m bpd in 2008, U.S. oil production had grown each year to reach 9.4 million bpd in 2015 -- a gain of 88% during Obama's presidency. BTW, a record among presidents

2986 2018-06-12 17:38:09 I hate going to the service station cause they find multiple things going on with your car. Go for a oil change..come out with new tires.
2987 2018-06-12 17:38:04 Thank you so much! CBD oil is the only thing I have tried that actually keeps me asleep all night without waking up like I usually do. Ambien, Benadryl, NyQuil, melatonin all don’t even do the trick. It’s incredible
2988 2018-06-12 17:37:58 Wanting game advice from a man who's been married to a girl he's known since his high school days is retarded. People always try to use that as an argument of him being a snake oil salesman.

As you said, benefit from the useful aspects of a person and ignore the negative ones.
2989 2018-06-12 17:37:56 @TwoDartMom Hemp oil is a broad term that can be used to describe hemp seed oil and hemp-derived CBD oil. Hemp seed oil is extracted only from seed and has few cannabinoids. @MomsMeet #LetsTweetCBD

2991 2018-06-12 17:37:50 the article states that this woman believes the cbd (cannabis oil) has "cured" her cancer. firstly, no oncologist would use the word "cured". secondly, where is her proof that the cbd was the cause of her remission? Her belief that it is not constitute proof and only serves...
2992 2018-06-12 17:37:48 My Dad says, "earl change" instead of "oil change" He's from N'awlins
2993 2018-06-12 17:37:46 Global investment in renewable energy has outpaced spending in coal, natural gas + nuclear power plant electricity, per the International Energy Agency. In 2016, $297 billion was spent on renewables, more than 2x the $143 billion spent on new nuclear, coal, gas + fuel oil plants.
2994 2018-06-12 17:37:45 I take a fish oil supplement & a please-don't-let-my-hair-fall-out vitamin
& I use a valerian tablet to help stay asleep sometimes
2995 2018-06-12 17:37:42 Oh definitely. That is a real compliment. We have lived with 3 cats over the years - all rescued feral cats from an oil pipe yard in Aberdeen and all real characters. The feline mentality has definitely rubbed off on us and left a lasting legacy.
2996 2018-06-12 17:37:38 Just please retire. Stop pretending and just go back to the oil and coal industry
2997 2018-06-12 17:37:38 #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes have u tried this oil:?
2998 2018-06-12 17:37:37 I have not tried CBD oil before, or any form of it, actually. There's so many types and brands out there, it's difficult to know which to try, or which form might be the best for me.  #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
2999 2018-06-12 17:37:34 Loan for out dated technology and loss making oil company abroad was possible only under Congi rule, spiritual person expected to be honest blaming DEMO for loss sounds ridiculous. If Govt had not changed loot by loss making companies wud continue & NPAs wud increase.
3000 2018-06-12 17:37:21 Can it be sold with oil?
3001 2018-06-12 17:37:19 A3 I have not but suffer from chronic pain,depression and anxiety...all of which I believe can be helped with CBD oil #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
3002 2018-06-12 17:37:13 Yes I agree with Steph! Also a little butter and olive oil did it for me 
3003 2018-06-12 17:37:13 I am concerned about leasing another Lincoln. My tires are bald at 35k miles. Tires are $450each and should last longer than this ... my Ford Fusion needed new tires at 21k miles. Regular oil change and tire rotations on both.. seems odd ! @Ford and @LincolnMotorCo
3004 2018-06-12 17:37:12 Oh here comes the fans of the club that's been relegated more than they've won the league,lol pipe down oil boy this convo is for fans of big clubs not oil made mockeries you only became relevant ten years ago,lol
3005 2018-06-12 17:37:11 I’ve never tried CBD Oil but I would absolutely love to! I’d try the balm for my lips and hands (since they get so dry) Ans the drops of gummies for whenever I’m stressed. #LetsTweetCBD #Sweepstakes
3006 2018-06-12 17:37:11 Obama entered exhibiting weakness in an entirely diff cultural setting. His efforts were doomed from start. He nor the ppl around him had the skills or understanding to pull it off properly.
3007 2018-06-12 17:37:02 I'm getting my oil changed and there's a popcorn machine popping away and tbh nothing makes me crave popcorn more than the intense anxiety of being the only woman in a building full of men while waiting to hear how fucked up my only mode of transportation is
3008 2018-06-12 17:37:01 Called 3 different Lexus to get a good price on a oil change
3009 2018-06-12 17:36:43 Dab Rigs, also known as "concentrate pipes" or "oil rigs", are one of the best ways to enjoy your legal essential oils in our modern times.
3010 2018-06-12 17:36:39 I’m drunk on olive oil like the good moozlem I am
3011 2018-06-12 17:36:33 Fair point. But optimism and reality are oil and water in Nigeria's political history. Since Ironsi, not once has fate or design favoured an Igbo presidency. So you can understand my position between a rock & hard place.
3012 2018-06-12 17:36:22 เจ้ก้อต้องแอบใช้ทีล่ะแท่ง
3013 2018-06-12 17:36:20 A3) I have not have had the chance to try CBD oil yet. It sounds amazing.  #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes.
3014 2018-06-12 17:36:15 That OIL 
3015 2018-06-12 17:36:01 I've tried the capsules for my interstitial cystitis but would love to try the oil #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
3016 2018-06-12 17:35:52 Beat gas prices by putting canola oil and kerosine in ur tank
3017 2018-06-12 17:35:50 So its like an essential oil that works instantly?? #LetsTweetCBD
3018 2018-06-12 17:35:42 But theres a lot of variation from person to person. But fwiw I've had repeated good experience with ingesting raw cbd oil orally for my sinuses & anxiety (threshold doses seem to be best), and i've heard directly from several ppl about how cbd topicals help them with nerve pain.
3019 2018-06-12 17:35:32 Q3 Not yet for myself! I give it to my dog twice a day, who was very sick when we started using CBD oil and now she is back to her old self! #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes.
3020 2018-06-12 17:35:32 Went to the gym for an hour and 45 mins, then dropped my car off for an oil changed and decided to walk home rather than getting a ride. Did all this after my graveyard shift lastnight/this morning  #stayactive
3021 2018-06-12 17:35:29 YES! I have vaped oil and used drops for pain and stress. #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
3022 2018-06-12 17:35:20 -----------------------> OIL <-------------------
3023 2018-06-12 17:35:06 Filled with oil marks
3024 2018-06-12 17:34:59 Yup, the only thing corn oil is good for is bar oil on your chainsaw.
3025 2018-06-12 17:34:48 what an Odious repulsive bladder of Lard this man is #ArronBanks  he insults our MPs this shifty snake oil salesman 
3026 2018-06-12 17:34:45 The olbas oil is sloshing around my brain I’ve inhaled so much
3027 2018-06-12 17:34:44 I alwasy wondered how that worked....half of USA on foodstamps, N Dakota almost a ghost town because all the oil rigs went down, Obama killing the pipeline, New Orleans not even slightly recovered from the flood, Chicago with more unemployment then ever...But great job numbers?
3028 2018-06-12 17:34:42 يازيييينهههه يا نااسسسس
3029 2018-06-12 17:34:36 Next doors smoke alarm went off. I'm guessing they haven't changed the oil in the deep fat fryer. #CloseNews
3030 2018-06-12 17:34:29 YouTube is the best tool for me. Just learned from a ATL stylist’s channel that I need to be moisturizing my braids w/ a mix of 4 oz water, 2 drops of condish & like 8 drops of jojoba/grape seed oil 3x a week + not spraying @ my scalp...
3031 2018-06-12 17:34:19 Bro i hate when I’m making breakfast and the bacon or egg starts fighting back at you throwing all this hot oil smh
3032 2018-06-12 17:34:12 May needs an oil change...
3033 2018-06-12 17:34:11 I’m still laughing because my mom wanted me to go wait and pay for a oil change. I hate someone else changing the oil because they be using the cheap as fucking oil then a lil while later and you’re due for another oil change
3034 2018-06-12 17:34:07 The goats do not make the oil.. where did you get that idea?
3035 2018-06-12 17:33:50 Me w oil pens </3
3036 2018-06-12 17:33:44 Yes, something Our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump not only is equipped for but seems to look forward to!  #MAGA18 >> #VoteRepublican !!
3037 2018-06-12 17:33:41 Google oil pulling with coconut oil! It has amazing results!!
3038 2018-06-12 17:33:33 Hai @chizubunny nak tanya. Oil cleanser/cleansing balm/ cleansing milk dan yg sama waktu dengan nya tu pakai sekali je waktu malam utk double cleansing or pakai tiap kali nak remove makeup. Sbb i pakai facial wipes je utk cuci makeup & ramai kata tak elok :(
3039 2018-06-12 17:33:32 I made a very affordable “pesto” by blending mint, spinach, olive oil, garlic and lemon juice together. I usually add feta and basil but that’s all I had. Stir through wholewheat pasta and you’re good to go.
3040 2018-06-12 17:33:29 Trump is a business man. One of first things taught is cultural appreciation. You don't have to agree, just respect it. Critique of giving Kim his moment wrong. It was important.
3041 2018-06-12 17:33:26 I thought it was to drive electric cars and use solar panels then get rid of oil production all together. Man I can't keep up with all this truth from you and @am950radio
3042 2018-06-12 17:33:18 Detailed assumption: 9c KwH overnight electricity, 25% of miles supercharged; for the bimmer...$3.20/gallon gas, 26 mpg.  Both cars accrue for tires.  Even if you tell me oil changes are free, etc.  I’d happily pay an extra 1-200 a month for a Model S over a 228.  It’s not close.
3043 2018-06-12 17:33:09 It’s so cool to see how far CBD oil has come since 1992! And to think many people are just finding out about it now. I bet it’s great it in any form. #LetsTweetCBD #hemp #Sweepstakes
3044 2018-06-12 17:33:04 お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！

英文：Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!
3045 2018-06-12 17:33:01 The secret is the oil.  It's gives life!  Guess where it says so?  The Bible.  Olive oil is one of the best foods you could ever eat.
3046 2018-06-12 17:33:00 Maybe a refinery or something but I don’t think oil fields
3047 2018-06-12 17:32:55 You just like me cause I smell like coconut oil 
3048 2018-06-12 17:32:54 Yo estoy pensando en la hamburguesa completa de la OIL que me voy a comer.
3049 2018-06-12 17:32:51 Leaking oil... It should be mobile on Friday.

3051 2018-06-12 17:32:46 I hear you Brooklyn, buy perfume oil fess then i will buy you food from the profit 
3052 2018-06-12 17:32:44 I need to condition and oil my hair today
3053 2018-06-12 17:32:39 Many ways they have Balms for the skin oils that can be taken in drinks or some that are flavored that can be taken on their own, Some people smoke the oil in vape pens as well #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
3054 2018-06-12 17:32:39 Pake baby oil Bisa ga?
3055 2018-06-12 17:32:37 Stray cats have taken over my screened porch! I can't go outside cause that would scare them.

Callie kitten is going crazy over the scratch pad I put there, sprayed with catnip oil. And big Yellow Cat, who's been sleeping there for hours, is very wary of me but hasn't left yet.
3056 2018-06-12 17:32:31 lepas pakai jojoba oil tu rambut nampak fresh tak? ke sama je rambut nanpak kering and kembang? hm
3057 2018-06-12 17:32:30 Big oil is big government / doo-dah, doo-dah…
3058 2018-06-12 17:32:26 Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of my Enemies

Thou anoints my head with oil, my cup runneth over 
3059 2018-06-12 17:32:22 I went to go get the oil changed and the car is in Joe's name so when the guy was done with my car he called me "Mrs Ramirez" 
3060 2018-06-12 17:32:21 Trump is preparing NK for alliance with Russia so that Russia can access NK oil. It is imperative to have US military weakened when Russia makes its play. What does it take for you to see the picture?
3061 2018-06-12 17:32:19 Getting oil changes really makes a difference, I was ready to throw the whole car away when my baby was just a lil thirsty 
3062 2018-06-12 17:32:08 Omg I wish I had known that last week I have peppermint oil I just use it for my diffuser 
3063 2018-06-12 17:32:01 Just my foundation colour and lip oil looks fab xx
3064 2018-06-12 17:31:59 oil pulling, homemade face mask, lavender oil in my diffuser, daily supplements, & green tea:

3067 2018-06-12 17:31:27 It's a Ponzi.  Sign this form for more meetings then get to the next meeting and promise to have more meetings and never get anything substantial accomplished.  Trump at his best as a snake oil salesmen.
3068 2018-06-12 17:31:22 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
3069 2018-06-12 17:31:19 And how exactly does kinder morgan expansion that is sending the oil to China give the middle finger to Saudi Arabia?

B.C tourism industry is $17B & you want to put that at risk for short term gains. Tsk.
3070 2018-06-12 17:31:15 Getting your car’s oil changed means watching The View with 3 other dudes in the customer service area.
3071 2018-06-12 17:30:58 I second Pastabilities! You can get their spicy hot tomato oil at Wegmans, which is also a CNY staple. Empire Brewing Company has a great selection of beers. If you like coffee and beer, try their local grind!
3072 2018-06-12 17:30:52 you better come and collect coconut oil before you peel your penis. new level kor new level ni
3073 2018-06-12 17:30:46 Ifb
3074 2018-06-12 17:30:41 so is it true Canada looses a lot in the soft wood lumber and crude oil trade w/ the US?
3075 2018-06-12 17:30:40 At least his donors are pro-AB oil
3076 2018-06-12 17:30:37 Getting an oil change is the worst, there’s always a long ass wait 
3077 2018-06-12 17:30:31 This is because of the culture of air conditioning in almost every government building has increased electricity bills. The debt accrues, and power producers are not given enough furnace oil to increase production during peak times. Vested interests stop the movement to coal
3078 2018-06-12 17:30:31 Blimey.  Having to clean your own car, as well as drive it?

3082 2018-06-12 17:30:19 I swear some of these guys don’t even know where to check the engine oil or what way to turn a damn bolt do loosen it . Like bitch it’s left. lefty loosey righty tighty .
3083 2018-06-12 17:29:47 I was just joking about - making fun of the talk radio/Fox fan who believes the Reagan Myth. If it wasn't for oil in Siberia and Ronnie believing in star wars it would have ended sooner.
3084 2018-06-12 17:29:44 The oil distribution companies in Brazil are now staring into space.  This trucking strike/+subsequent Gov't intervention has left everyone w a complicated fixed price/rebate scheme which could be revoked at any time, making it hard to act.  From the bleachers...not good. #OOTT
3085 2018-06-12 17:29:37 Can my oil change wait till next pay check? 
3086 2018-06-12 17:29:35 Supes chose last month not to appeal court ruling against most of Z for Big Oil promise not to seek millions in legal fees. #MontereyCounty

3089 2018-06-12 17:29:30 Why is the EU banning palm oil?
3090 2018-06-12 17:29:29 There’s nothing he says or does that has impacted my life in a bad way-I apologize for NO one-I call him out when I need too-you had the snake oil salesman who stuck you in the back-and you still love him....Who doesn’t have a clue?
3091 2018-06-12 17:29:28 Awesome oil
3092 2018-06-12 17:29:23 THC cannabis oil can be beneficial for patients suffering from dementia, motor neuron disease, and neurogenic issues such as muscle spasms.
3093 2018-06-12 17:29:17 I've been struggling with the idea that so many of my friends, family and neighbors saw this was coming, and they voted for it. Maybe they thought they'd come out ahead. Maybe they believed there was some kernel of truth or principle underneath the snake oil. Maybe they didn't.
3094 2018-06-12 17:29:14 Because she didn’t have the correct pan or oil!! And where was the thyme smh
3095 2018-06-12 17:29:14 I took my daily multivitamin and fish oil pills then proceeded to put Vitamin A and Vitamin C serum on my face.

3099 2018-06-12 17:28:21 If your methodological ideology requires you to become a snake oil salesmen in regard to historical church facts & institutional practices just to peddle your methodological wares don’t be surprised when no one buys your gathering brand.

3103 2018-06-12 17:27:37 Maaaaybe. Maybe more oil monster xD
3104 2018-06-12 17:27:26 Petrol&Diesel prices have been cut for 14th time in a row since 29th May 2018;Bigger news is,if Crude were to go back to $80/barrel&stay there,our Oil import bill would roughly be $93bn,translating into a #CAD of $60-70bn;that would still roughly be just 2.4% of GDP! #Modinomics
3105 2018-06-12 17:27:13 Texas will become more like North Dakota as trucking of oil becomes more common until new pipelines are finished.
3106 2018-06-12 17:26:36 The oil filter service is a fucking piece of piss compared to the Audi.
3107 2018-06-12 17:26:34 I used truffle oil today and there is no going back holy fuck
3108 2018-06-12 17:26:33 In truth, I never understood how Obama supposedly delivered all these jobs, but somehow 50% of the people in the USA needed foodstamps, and homelessness was going up, and out GDP sucked. Stores were empty, N Dakota was out of work because of the oil drilling regulations...
3109 2018-06-12 17:26:19 Lol I upgraded mine .. just a lil oil in your frying pan with the barbecue sauce and Suya pepper .. toss the wings in the mixture and enjoy

3112 2018-06-12 17:25:48 They didn’t want to talk peace with Kim because they didn’t WANT peace..... omg.... what if the real reason for all these wars isn’t about money or oil or any of that?.... what if the real reason they keep wars going is to get children from war torn countries? 
3113 2018-06-12 17:25:45 I'm a firm believer in hemp oil. I am certain it's helped me lower my blood sugar.
3114 2018-06-12 17:25:44 Yes bb do it with coco oil

3118 2018-06-12 17:25:09 I have a feeling the policy prescription for this boils down to "axe the Today Programme and boil John Humphries in oil"
3119 2018-06-12 17:25:07 There’s always opportunity in crises, it’s about seeing money when the masses panic.  It’s a great opportunity as the market indexes.  Jan 15 the bank index fell due to Oil exposure worries...but not all banks have oil exposure.  Took a week for prices to correct

3121 2018-06-12 17:24:43 In theory, yes. Building the pipeline& getting oil to tidewater atfair market prices will benefit every single Cdn. Shutting down SM on dairy products, eggs, maple syrup, etc.,  will not hurt Cdns as a whole, only some in those industries. It's a cartel. No need for them anymore.

3123 2018-06-12 17:24:13 Countries do not “lose” money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first. Canada has items that the United States wants, such as oil and lumber.

3126 2018-06-12 17:23:56 Pete are you on something Ian Wood is a phoney who has ruined the Oil Industry. Check out the Wood report recommending men work a pattern of 3 and 3 instead of 2 and 3 costing jobs and making more profit for the oil companies. Do some research the SNP deserves better.

3131 2018-06-12 17:23:37 Didn't you see it. Few weeks back when she launched her oil. Florence met her at the door and there was a picture of Bam delivering her oil to her. It should be on her Ig page.
3132 2018-06-12 17:23:36 Alex Salmond’s forecast (ex RBOS economist don’t forget) for 2016 N Sea oil revenue: £17bn

Actual figure: £208m. That’s out by a factor of 100. @theSNP economics = fantasy economics (Source: Growth Commission; SPICE)

3141 2018-06-12 17:22:40 Bro my mom just told me that I have to take the car to go get an oil change because she's on a diet LMAO 
3142 2018-06-12 17:22:21 What state does your mom live in. ? I live in a state where the government does not care about anyone unless they own an oil well and I definitely dont have any approval of the "taxes reform" but my Medicare deductible is only $600 That's why I was wondering what was added.
3143 2018-06-12 17:22:19 I found a type of tea I've only read about in books and it tastes like someone doised a campfire in motor oil. Tastes ok if I could avoid smelling it. #disappointed

3145 2018-06-12 17:22:12 Yes please!!! I use coconut oil from time to time which helps but I don't do it too regularly. Also it's been really hot so it all melted and is very hard to apply

3152 2018-06-12 17:21:27 People are overreacting to the purchase. Billions of tax dollars have gone to oil industry in tax breaks etc. The govt has helped Alberta before but the people who live there are blind and dumb.
3153 2018-06-12 17:21:23 My borthers dog had a big cancer lump on her belly & we thought that was the end of her because shes 15 as well but he got her that oil & the lump is gone don't know if the cancer is thou but she running about like hes a pup again lol
3154 2018-06-12 17:21:19 NOW: How North Dakota's oil boom compares to #Texas.
3155 2018-06-12 17:21:18 Gas up due to Iran sanctions being reinstated (and their oil restricted from major markets).  Healthcare is up from Obama policy’s.  Dollar being down atm is a good thing.  Trade gap down?  Tariffs will fix this.  Exports down?  Not so sure about that.  He’ll be exonerated to.

3158 2018-06-12 17:20:51 Same excuse we get EVERY summer. Refineries close down for maintenance during the summer months so the price of oil goes up. Happens every summer no matter who is president. Unless he uses our reserves which no president does the price remains high thru Labor Day

3176 2018-06-12 17:18:55 1. It was secretive. Just now finding out more.
2. Obama was begging for a deal
3. Not a treaty. Just pen/phone stuff
4. Sold with lies and deception
5.Just a horrible deal

3185 2018-06-12 17:17:53 All this negativity from Government & drug manufacturers about cannabis oil, the only reason they don’t want it is if it’s found to work it will bankrupt pharmaceutical companies & make the so called experts look stupid What’s the harm in letting people use it, they’re ill anyway
3186 2018-06-12 17:17:53 Yes im aggressive about adding oil into your routines
3187 2018-06-12 17:17:52 Ever just go to say something to your google assistant and then realize that you’ve been talking to an oil diffuser?
3188 2018-06-12 17:17:51 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

3191 2018-06-12 17:17:42 CBD oil has so many benefits #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes
3192 2018-06-12 17:17:38 Causales:
1. Oil estaba en una agencia en lugar de en Grandes Contribuyentes.
2. Interrumpieron innumerables veces el procedimiento previo al juicio ejecutivo.
3. No verificaron que se cumplieran las condiciones pevistas en el art. 32 para dar planes de 120 cuotas.
3193 2018-06-12 17:17:35 I went to get my oil changed and none of my info had been updated in like 10 years so they had my old email #funkygurl
3194 2018-06-12 17:17:16 Not to mention that medical cannabis oil is completely non-intoxic: it doesn’t have any “effect” on the mind.
3195 2018-06-12 17:17:03 Add some god dam oil into your skincare routine if you wear make up.

3198 2018-06-12 17:16:51 Once while canvassing to stop the construction of an oil pipeline I encountered a middle aged white man living near the Shawangunk Mountains. "Do you care about the earth?" "Oh well I'm dying soon anyway." "You mentioned a son. Do you care about his future?" "No."
3199 2018-06-12 17:16:50 But that's so true in many areas. Nikolai Tesla invented free energy early 20th century,  but too many rich guys were making boatloads of cash with oil. Rich people hate change,  especially if it affects their bank account!
3200 2018-06-12 17:16:49 @Mpilo96241956 really they sell caster oil there I am sure if u buy there they will give u free toilet paper
3201 2018-06-12 17:16:22 Also remember that the UN has done lots of inquiries on the DPRK cause it is believed that Kim has done more against human rights on his own people, including sticking motor oil into the stomachs of pregnant women, and letting his people die of starvation.
3202 2018-06-12 17:16:11 I tried but had some horrible results. I substitute GenesisToday Acaí 100 and get all of the Omega source that Fish oil gives without the digestion issues.
3203 2018-06-12 17:15:57 Sometimes personal feelings need to be put aside. Prime minister dress up obviously isn’t the best man for the job, but he is doing what’s best for Canada and canadian interests by taking a hardline with trump. Now if only we already had pipelines built to sell oil elsewhere.
3204 2018-06-12 17:15:55 I wont forget period.  Had enough of this crap I say loud and clear dismantle the trade between our counties. Let the USA get there oil, power, lumber, natural gas and steel from russia. Ther new best friend. They can not produce enough for their needs good luck
3205 2018-06-12 17:15:53 Here I am minding my business at Walmart waiting to get my oil changed and this random women looks at me and says “We all wished we looked like you, you are very pretty” and it made my day  I love nice people

3208 2018-06-12 17:15:38 How do we fix this @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley? I know, build more pipelines and increase oil production. It is YOUR responsibility to listen to scientists and lead in protecting earth, which you promised. You lied.
3209 2018-06-12 17:15:36 Hahahaha, I see you bought the snake oil from the grifter.
3210 2018-06-12 17:15:30 They’re also confident the #OPEC member will be able to keep the naira stable, thanks in part to oil prices having climbed around 60 percent in the past year.

3228 2018-06-12 17:13:51 That is true but we must understand that we cant export oil on trucks, GOK must invest more in constructing pipelines that are economical viable to transport this type of liquid in bulk & consideration of oil prices in the international market must b taken to account @energy_ke
3229 2018-06-12 17:13:44 I’ve read so much about it. Does it help with anxiety? The oil lol #LetsTweetCBD
3230 2018-06-12 17:13:38 It’s better to have a diversified portfolio. I have stocks in oil, energy, and manufacturing companies. I read up on and watch their movements obsessively.
3231 2018-06-12 17:13:30 But they have oil you see. So its different.
3232 2018-06-12 17:13:29 I do think tracking is an important step in understanding energy values. On that basis people may eat olives and avocados and smoked salmon covered in gallons of olive oil, thinking they’re doing right, on their smaller plates

3254 2018-06-12 17:11:17 Well, we just lost billions due to the increase in oil prices from the deal falling apart. The main motivation for the deal was to give relief to Russia by increasing oil prices. that is more significant. Trump usually tries to do things to benefit Russia.

3262 2018-06-12 17:10:41 This is a big deal because NK and SK are seen as making the Peace gestures.  Saves face for Koreans.

It's not the big bad USA handing them reactors and oil that spurned it.  Quite the opposite.

It's why this has better chance.
3263 2018-06-12 17:10:41 You're missing time value of money, greatly exaggerating what gas and oil cost, as well as Tesla's residual values. Lease prices are a good proxy for this, which is why $TSLA is $1000/mo. You're making the case this is better than $299/mo Camry and $500/mo BMW?

3270 2018-06-12 17:09:53 yes. it’s a gr8 healing oil. i’ve used it for facial bumps, cuts, bruises, piercings, etc.
3271 2018-06-12 17:09:49 best way to deal with molds is throw a flask of oil on them and set them on fire. Especially the ones which eat metal armour...

3279 2018-06-12 17:09:20 It's why trumps trade war is stupid. The wheel was turning. Bullying and threatening was not necessary. We control the taps to 42% of your oil.  The taps to power. Both of which u.s pays significantly less for-until our pipe to bc is done. Bc you pay less 4 power we pay the diff
3280 2018-06-12 17:09:12 Good news! It’s taken eight years of twice-a-week therapy sessions, but we’ve finally discovered that the reason that I don’t like olive oil is because of all the Popeye cartoons my parents made me watch.
3281 2018-06-12 17:09:11 Indeed... and the shock of the difference between 32 and 42 is horrific. Bring on the Oil of Ulay (or whatever it's called now).
3282 2018-06-12 17:08:45 And expensive oil neh...

3291 2018-06-12 17:07:47 If the solar facilities are built on old slagged-out oil and coal fields, which have been rendered incapable of supporting life due to the fossil fuel exhaustion, then at least that land is being put to some sort of use....
3292 2018-06-12 17:07:34 Government get serious. How can counterfeit commodities  (sugar/ cooking oil ) get into the market??
3293 2018-06-12 17:07:25 I have quite a few friends who use CBD oil and swear by it. #LetsTweetCBD #sweepstakes

3296 2018-06-12 17:07:22 It has to start with a handshake, dont you agree to that much? Or are you of the persuasion that thinks sending over a pallet of cash,  500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, ora wink and an email or two is effective diplomacy?
3297 2018-06-12 17:07:22 Still need to add oil to the car
3298 2018-06-12 17:07:20 Kim is lucky he doesn't have any oil. No one wants his squalid little country. The only thing he has to offer is a slave labor force.
3299 2018-06-12 17:07:10 @NickHurdUK respectfully, #BillyCaldwell's GP prescribed cannabis oil - which isn't THC or a psycho-active drug - properly to help with debilitating epilepsy seizures which since the medication's stopped he's having again. His pain/distress is on YOU! Please help. #disability
3300 2018-06-12 17:07:08 A dry microfiber cloth wiping off a dot of olive oil left scratches way worse than the dot of olive oil today. It’s been a year since they were painted. Definitely not a realistic product for use in a kitchen. I wish they would specify that.
3301 2018-06-12 17:07:00 Does he want their hostility to immigration or their ethnic homogeny?

Norway, for example, is rich mainly because it has a tiny population and a ton of oil, then they invested their oil money into a sovereign wealth fund (i.e. the stock market).
3302 2018-06-12 17:06:59 It's being shown that CBD oil can help with many diseases.  CBD extracted from cannabis is hard to get and illegal in most states but CBD oil from hemp is totally legal and available in all 50 states.
3303 2018-06-12 17:06:47 Same guy that said he didn't want ANY Trump voters to patronize his business. 
Very open minded.
3304 2018-06-12 17:06:45 They blind you with NYS and NCPB scandals committed last year. You get busy while they start selling your oil up there, to themselves then import later. It's just a cycle.

3314 2018-06-12 17:06:02 @itvcentral Maybe chemotherapy worked for that lady or her cancer went into spontaneous remission. There have been no clinical trials of cannabis oil. It is dangerous to refer to it as a medicine, it could be potentially harmful especially if people opt out of proven treatments.

3327 2018-06-12 17:05:02 The PM was far from a puppet. The nuclear deal wouldn't have been possible with a puppet. The economy was well managed during global recession. Oil prices were in control. People could eat what they want. All this not possible with a puppet
3328 2018-06-12 17:04:54 Please come invade Alberta and our oil reserves. Our governments STINK!
3329 2018-06-12 17:04:39 If the oil works and improves his life then the government are wrong to stop him from having access to it. It's not like he is using as a recreational drug. It's time medicinal cannabis was put to good use and not banned by our outdated laws.
3330 2018-06-12 17:04:39 Need a oil change & tune up very bad
3331 2018-06-12 17:04:27 Trump's ace up his sleeve is ending NAFTA & closing the border to all our exports: oil/gas, cars/trucks, dairy/eggs, metals/nonmetals, consulting, etc, etc. We would be dead in the water.

3335 2018-06-12 17:03:32 It did however the oil is so unpredictable. Sometimes I would feel really high and I don't like that feeling at all. I think if I had found a proper form on indica to work with, I would have had a better experience.
3336 2018-06-12 17:03:31 They'd just won a championship with JR, so they had to pay him because they couldn't give the money to anyone else. Also, when you're competing for championships, you're not really concerned about draft picks. "Win now" and "draft picks" are almost like oil and water.
3337 2018-06-12 17:03:14 where tf do you live lmao my mechanic does that shit for $40 max & that just includes getting the oil myself
3338 2018-06-12 17:03:08 Brad apparently has no idea how the oil industry, particularly oilsands got started or how they’re still subsidized. His hyperpartisan stance indicates he’d prefer large corporate made rather than support hard working local entrepreneurs. His stance is purely political. #ableg
3339 2018-06-12 17:03:05 it’s mayo made with avocado oil !
3340 2018-06-12 17:02:55 I’d like to thank trump for managing to unite every political party on this issue. I’m sure we can sell oil else where. Just need to get some #pipelines built.
3341 2018-06-12 17:02:52 It threatened the viability of the oil industry.  It has the same leitmotif as the strange death of the Kinder Morgan pipeline.  KXL was obstructed at the request of both the the Canadian and American left.

3344 2018-06-12 17:02:40 Went to target for trash bags and basically bought a whole new summer wardrobe. I just wanna know who I thought I was and why I thought I had money like that?? I was supposed to get an oil change and like pay rent???? Also I forgot trash bags.
3345 2018-06-12 17:02:37 @Morrisons Hi Morrisons. I’ve noticed your vegetable suet is palm oil free.  Well done.  However I still can’t buy it because it comes in a non recyclable plastic bag. Why?  Please can you sell it in cardboard boxes instead.

I just followed him over to the shoulder, grabbed the extinguisher from behind my seat and went at it before it spread
3397 2018-06-12 16:57:09 I smell like Efficascent oil
3398 2018-06-12 16:57:07 Fuck I have to take my car into the dealership to get an oil change and my car smells like marijuana I can’t wait to be judged by these white middle aged men.

3405 2018-06-12 16:56:26 They should also turn off the oil supply.

3409 2018-06-12 16:56:06 you say, enter the upper bands where moves tend to terminate.  ?meaning, oil going lower below your 'stink bid'  and this was just a DCB for now? or, until we visit the lower bands to terminate a 'down' move'?
3410 2018-06-12 16:55:54 We are close to being oil independent!  1.7 Billion was interest!  I have a problem with giving thugs interest like that.  Btw, Iran has admitted to helping with 9/11.
3411 2018-06-12 16:55:45 i saw an ad for a food company saying they’re lowering the use of palm oil, now all i can think about is #edexcelgeography paper 3 and rambling about indonesia and palm oil/deforestation for 90mins

3420 2018-06-12 16:54:21 Not concerned - 66,000 miles, and I’ve had to spend $1.68 on a new key fob battery.  No gas, brakes, maintenance, or oil changes, and free road trips, so we are in total cost of ownership territory of a Camry, but it drives like a 911 and has storage of a Yukon.  No brainer.
3421 2018-06-12 16:54:09 It's all theater. There is no substance. There is no plan beyond self-aggrandizement and fueling the base: the wealthiest 1%, big oil, fake Evangelicals, uneducated white people. Constant need for enemies. For "others" to blame. #trumpisafraud #ConmanDon

3424 2018-06-12 16:53:41 Given that there's nothing to get from NK, there was absolutely no motive for Trump to broker a deal, other than for peace.

Unlike the Iran deal where the US and Europe struck shady business deals along with negotiations for oil and money. Max corruption.

3429 2018-06-12 16:53:27 He hit debris on the highway that slashed a oil cooler line right by where it comes out of the engine. Was spraying oil back onto the Y pipe for the exhaust and the cat. He shut it off and pulled over quickly so I dont think he lost enough oil pressure to harm the engine.

3511 2018-06-12 16:44:45 James, that is essentially correct. In the case of oil sands, however, oil migrated to near the surface where microbes digested the lighter fractions resulting in the heavy, carbon & asphalt rich composition. It started as "normal" oil but was subsequent biodegraded.

3531 2018-06-12 16:41:55 For you folks who think ending joint exercises & pulling out troops is a good thing, our absence will cause a vacuum. China &/or Russia iwill take up primacy in the Western Pacific. And they who control the Pacific control trade, especially oil.

3534 2018-06-12 16:41:49 Stand up to Canada,  really. Should not take much. If we stop importing their oil,  they have no economy
3535 2018-06-12 16:41:45 @realDonaldTrump Can you believe that Trump tried to convince Un to build ”condos on his beautiful beaches”. Trump is a danger to world peace. He is an idiot. He knows nothing about being anything other than a snake oil salesman! The ravaged land and people of N. Korea must be???
3536 2018-06-12 16:41:41 Stupid oil change
3537 2018-06-12 16:41:09 This truck has been rolling coal for 5+ miles on the freeway. I hope that's not oil 
3538 2018-06-12 16:41:01 Literally spent 20 mins in the shop trying to buy oil for my car cause apparently there’s a million different ones for different engines!!!

3541 2018-06-12 16:40:52 We just got in this incredible Eastman SB59/V with an antiqued oil varnish finish and Seymour Duncan Antiquity pickups.  This is not just another LP copy - this thing has its own mojo going on and is built with the finest materials and craftsmanship!

3543 2018-06-12 16:40:31 I had an appointment with a podiatrist today. He said I have an old sole.  But for real, I had an appointment with a podiatrist and I’m pretty much gonna be wearing Birks for the rest of my days. Cue the waft of patchouli oil in 3...2...1... #punkrockhippie

3547 2018-06-12 16:40:21 Why do you people cook with so much oil?
3548 2018-06-12 16:40:12 Thank you babe. Gnna have to go and get some coconut oil.
3549 2018-06-12 16:40:12 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3550 2018-06-12 16:40:07 Please keep your racism to yourself. For the record, Scotland has supported England with its oil monies for decades and you couldn't even try a 'thank you'.
3551 2018-06-12 16:40:04 Your input is appreciated Thomas.  There is a simple test to your belief. Are you willing to let the rest of the country dump the oil that leaks out of the lines in your front yard?

3561 2018-06-12 16:38:41 PM of Canada has a re-election next year and he’s already lost a lot of support due to his policies on oil and pipelines. If he loses Quebec support he won’t even run next year. Canadian politics isn’t hard a few quick reads and you will be much more informed.

3570 2018-06-12 16:38:18 Ask your “plug” who ran the oil or was the tree chopped for live resin or cured ? Properly flushed ? Or just looks fire  be carful on what you guys smoke !
3571 2018-06-12 16:38:18 @ASRomaEN where is all the money coming from  ? you dont have the oil Money , DO you  ???
3572 2018-06-12 16:38:04 but it that oil doesnt get to cushing... it is widening in sympathy
3573 2018-06-12 16:37:56 OPEC says Trump trade war with Canada will force US to buy more oil from Muslims. This will result in a 30% increase at the pump. Does this bother you at all?
3574 2018-06-12 16:37:49 You gotta understand where Oil fans are coming from if they are worried about this happening.  So many years of poor trades.  Do we need to bring up Reinhart trade?

3578 2018-06-12 16:37:13 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

3586 2018-06-12 16:36:31 Try it without baby oil on your fingers. As poorly prepared as Ally McLeod was 40 years ago.
3587 2018-06-12 16:36:29 Olive oil is more healthier than P.Oil. Spain is a good place for getting it, althought USA & Trump trading decisions are reducing the exportations of this good treasure.
3588 2018-06-12 16:36:22 There you go. CYA by the snake oil salesman.  He buried his personal history too!
3589 2018-06-12 16:36:17 Obviously fake news promoted by left wing fake media.  Fortunately, we have that plucky band of hero oil company execs to protect us from environmental catastrophe.

3602 2018-06-12 16:34:46 More sanctions which in turn encouraged China to stop sending petrol/refined oil products, also shut down NK's shadow economy routes. Signs suggest NK leadership now favours an economic model like China's - can be open to external trade but still have state control.

3607 2018-06-12 16:34:31 EIA sees OPEC-14 crude oil production down 130kbpd to 31.93kbpd in May, due to Nigeria (-180kbpd). EIA forecasts OPEC-14 crude output to average 32.02mbpd (was 32.44mbpd) in 2018 and 32.05mbpd (was 32.26mbpd) in 2019 due to lower expected production in Iran and Venezuela.

3621 2018-06-12 16:33:04 The reason gas prices are higher is as a result of the world economy improving. Our state is producing more oil than ever as is Texas. Our unemployment rate at record low. Sorry your not doing well. We’re making money by the bushel!
3622 2018-06-12 16:32:58 If oil is ok you may have an oil pump fault. Not good engine will seize up

3637 2018-06-12 16:31:12 Check your oil level Chris. It doesn't mean there's water in in. It means it's low.  Might just be short circuiting in the wet

3647 2018-06-12 16:29:56 So let me get this well, when this @AlikoDangote refinery is completed, can he knock down the pump price based on the fact that he's not importing finish product and the crude oil is gotten here. I just can't wait. The only challenge is the road network. Logistic nightmare.
3648 2018-06-12 16:29:52 Boss, Kenya does not have the technology to refine the oil. Our refinery is long dead, it's used as a storage facility. It's why there was talk of building a new refinery bt Uganda chickened out. Meanwhile we can still export, low proceeds but it has money comming in. #Pessimist

3653 2018-06-12 16:29:40 At some point commonsense needs to prevail in STEO reports. I just do not see another 1 MM barrels/day increase with severe pipeline limitations for NG.NGL and oil from Permian. C&J energy company announcement today is a start. Export needs to increase as US refiners maxed out.
3654 2018-06-12 16:29:38 Trump needs to take himself, and take his oil drilling business somewhere else besides Florida's coast. Shame of @Schwarzenegger  for telling him to drill off coast of Florida. You're not a true environmentalist if all you care about is oil drilling off of California's coast.
3655 2018-06-12 16:29:38 College roommates did the same.  They turned the stove on, put the wok on the stovetop, let it heat up to 10, and then poured oil in the wok.

Fire extinguishers were used.  Deliberate use of the plural and passive.

3671 2018-06-12 16:28:13 Just wonder what the Greens suggestion for oil is.  Managed downwards at some point in the future to a diversified renewable energy economy so that workers are transferred or shutdown and workers thrown on the scrapheap now.
3672 2018-06-12 16:27:55 This picture smell like cigarettes, nascar, engine oil, trailer park, and an opened family pack of cool ranch Doritos.
3673 2018-06-12 16:27:48 Most of the terrorists who have killed Americans have been Saudis, and you give them cash and weapons every time you buy oil. The U.S. was obligated under the terms of the court decision to give them their money back. Why are you so misinformed?

3675 2018-06-12 16:27:43 I once set my stove on fire cooking with olive oil.

3678 2018-06-12 16:27:22 Which subsidies do you mean when it comes to oil? I agree oil shouldn’t be subsidized at all. A tax can be called many thing including a ‘tool’. I could support a carbon tax if the hst was reduced an equal amount. Or simply divert money from revenue if this is a priority
3679 2018-06-12 16:27:20 Baby powder forms a barrier that keeps oil and grime from seeping into the threads, so sprinkle on clothes, esp underarms
3680 2018-06-12 16:27:15 it isn’t mayo? they said it’s avocado oil
3681 2018-06-12 16:27:14 NCA vehicles just drive by & the building continues. Owner threatens everyone to try & stop him. It seems he is above the law. He uses huge Bamburi cement trucks to deliver cement. He is said to be an magendo petrol dealer. He uses oil tankers to deliver water to the mjengo.
3682 2018-06-12 16:27:08 Been able to stop wearing makeup to work for about a couple of months now because I finally feel comfortable w my skin again and it's honestly the best feeling after over a year or horrible skin, thanks to ACV & coconut oil 
3683 2018-06-12 16:27:01 Yes. I did get that point. It's astonishing how much milage the oil industry is getting out of brainwashing/bribing the conservatives into climate change denial. They literally would rather not look at Earth than see the truth.
3684 2018-06-12 16:26:56 get youself some rice seasoning or some black garlic oil and just eat that too forever

3687 2018-06-12 16:26:30 I always knew I loved yawl, but this just proves it!!
3688 2018-06-12 16:26:27 You guys know that olive oil has a really low smoking point, right?? I’m worried about everyone who uses it for cooking at high temps.
3689 2018-06-12 16:26:15 props to steven for going to italy and bringing me back pasta and olive oil bc he knows exactly what i would want

3691 2018-06-12 16:26:04 The invade on Iraq was 100% for the oil, there were no terrorists in Iraq, North Africa is not Iraq, get your facts right.
3692 2018-06-12 16:25:50 What the hell. Buy the oil and find someone to change it for free! It’s supper easy
3693 2018-06-12 16:25:43 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
3694 2018-06-12 16:25:39 Fishing wire, cooking oil and a size smaller top should do lol

3702 2018-06-12 16:24:33 And I am also switching from cheesebugers to sandwhiches. So less meat and more healthy foods. I do like to eat red and green peppers when there cooked with oil which I like to do sometimes and make a fish and rice combo and eat good salmon with vegatables.
3703 2018-06-12 16:24:32 小ネタいいな
3704 2018-06-12 16:24:22 Yes but oil & gas are so heavily subsidized (free $$$). It's difficult for alternative reneweables to make a headway to get products & systems to us. Carbon pricing is just a tool to reduce emissions in the meantime.
3705 2018-06-12 16:24:22 Feed her coconut oil in small amounts. If she won’t eat it, rub it on her feet so she has to lick it off. You can also put it on the dryer spots of her skin. Just not too heavy bc it can cause diarrhea before they adjust to the oil.

3714 2018-06-12 16:22:50 I have one phrase for you: 'pay driver'. The only reason Maldonado was in F1 was because of £millions from the Venezuelan oil industry. When this sponsorship ended, so did his F1 career. The two are entirely coincidental.
3715 2018-06-12 16:22:49 This pm I was privileged to act as the end of year reviewer for one of our @lawstrath PhD students.

3769 2018-06-12 16:17:39 John Fashanu the ex footballer who's own child suffers from epilepsy went to US for a itv programme he saw first hand what cannabis oil can do. I think if you can find away to contact him he might help. It would be good to have a celeb campaigning for access to cannabis oil.

3771 2018-06-12 16:17:32 Yeah so jojoba oil is cool but grapeseed is still number 1 only because it help balance oils so your skin won’t be as oily as it use to be. It is an amazing oil though. Top 3 for sure. Grapeseed, Rosehip and Jojoba for face =

3798 2018-06-12 16:15:08 Nice, but you must promise that the Conservatives will totally eradicate this outrageous fake tax. And lower other taxes, ease biz regs and try to get back all the foreign investors justie pushed away. Think any oil co will take over the TM pipeline?

3812 2018-06-12 16:14:02 EIA thinks the oil market was in a deficit of -0.48mbpd in 2017 (previously -0.51), for 2018 they expect the oil market to be undersupplied by 0.07mbpd (was 0.17mbpd oversupplied) and oversupplied by 0.20mbpd (was 0.63mbpd) in 2019. #OOTT

3838 2018-06-12 16:11:17 Short dollar positioning across the "macro market" -- (copper,oil,gold,gasoline rbob, heating oil ho, dxy futures) is still very one sided.  All speculative positioning across those listed depend on dollar not rising from here.

3840 2018-06-12 16:11:13 (4) One of the reasons for last year meeting between OPEC's Barkindo and President Maduro was to ease the gap between sources about Venezuela's oil output. The meeting worked for a while towards that goal, but the gap is now expanding
3841 2018-06-12 16:11:09 My facts are correct, that is the dollar values, but RBI makes sure to control the dollar-rupee value between Rs. 63 - 68 because India has good dollar reserves. Two months ago 1 dollar = Rs. 63 when crude oil was $55, today 1 dollar = Rs. 67.5 when crude is $72.

3867 2018-06-12 16:08:29 (3) OPEC attributed rising prices to Venezuela's shortfall. "The oil market was underpinned by fears of potential disruption to oil flows due to geopolitical tensions, concerns about Venezuela's crude production slipping further and with bullish drawdowns in US inventories"
3868 2018-06-12 16:08:24 Trudeau screwed up and Quebec’s disproportional political pull is why those dairy tariffs exist. But, across the spectrum of the trillion dollar trade deal, there are tariffs going both ways. And the US gets a sweet deal on oil from Canada.

3949 2018-06-12 16:00:28 i feel you i went in for my first oil change and they called me like “ok u need new wipers so we’ll go ahead and put those on with ur OK for $9.99 each” and i was like “i got my car 2 months ago i dont need new wipers” but they also do check important things like filters in ur
3950 2018-06-12 16:00:22 okayyyy i used to think this one is an oil cleanser  would like to try this one too! 
3951 2018-06-12 16:00:20 To put it simply, the Saudi govt is a family dictatorship that the US & brits installed to access/control oil. “Ethnic Saudis” preside over the working majority as a oppressive ruling class. Saudi govt coordinates w Israel. Hate the govt, love the people & the land 
3952 2018-06-12 16:00:15 How much oil does North Korea have?
3953 2018-06-12 16:00:11 when I was a kid "Oil of Olay" was "Oil of Ulan" or something, but I don't go to.
3954 2018-06-12 16:00:07 Why don't we export fresh water to the Gulf countries in exchange for oil?
3955 2018-06-12 16:00:02 Burning the MIDNIGHT OIL should never be for nothing but something totally worth!!! Don't do it if you won't do it...!!

3959 2018-06-12 15:59:32 Good Morning Detroit. Besides the great eats we launched our Detroit Sour, The Old Gear Oil -  spontaneous fermented and 3 year barrel aged sour brown ale.  It's a rare and delicious treat. Not unlike our own shorts-year-round Scotty. Cheers.

3962 2018-06-12 15:59:17 I have never tried it in my hair since my hair super thick. I recommend Jamaican Black Castor Oil for hair growth 
3963 2018-06-12 15:59:11 Two lovely new oil paintings in today at West Wight Framing, Yarmouth High Street....thanks to Tony Wilson for sharing with us.
3964 2018-06-12 15:59:09 Awh!! Put on some non comodogenic oil and use that to dilute the tea tree. Idk tea tree oil usually works pretty fast for me

3966 2018-06-12 15:59:01 no, we both know that the world is run on oil and will be for at least the next 100 yrs.

3968 2018-06-12 15:58:47 Look it UP! The money they received was theirs. It was financial assets & oil revenues that had been previously frozen. Very basically, the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China & the EU) unfroze billions of their dollars & they agreed to stop enriching uranium for 15 years.
3969 2018-06-12 15:58:39 Are they fracking/ mining or drilling for oil nearby?
3970 2018-06-12 15:58:37 excellent points. Colonization worked as it brought rule of law. Without any system to enforce contracts and protect property rights, these forays end up as bad investments. Concerning oil Nigeria is a good example.
3971 2018-06-12 15:58:36 อ่าวหรอ 5555

3974 2018-06-12 15:58:18 I never no  how hard Nigeria was until I saw my friend eating bread with anointing oil
3975 2018-06-12 15:58:18 Need and oil change, come in and see us today! Buy three and your fourth one is on us!
3976 2018-06-12 15:58:11 Wtf kinda nutrients does cod liver oil even give 
3977 2018-06-12 15:58:07 When are they going to bring back Pontiacs??
I want a car that needs something replaced every 3000 miles besides the oil.
3978 2018-06-12 15:57:57 Donald Trump & Facts = Oil & Water.
3979 2018-06-12 15:57:55 Depends on how long high oil prices persist. Late cycle US economy means 2nd round inflation effects are a possibility.
3980 2018-06-12 15:57:46 @westcountyhonda wow appointment for a oil change at 9:15 is almost 11 thanks
3981 2018-06-12 15:57:36 Also, the first study is about healing burns (in conjunction with silver sulphadiazine) and the 2nd study you've linked is about coconut oil as a sunscreen.
3982 2018-06-12 15:57:29 Is there oil or gas drilling near?
3983 2018-06-12 15:57:25 Ngikik posa masih setia sm jojoba oil
3984 2018-06-12 15:56:58 This is truly bizarre! I was about to go on about its primary function to ego massage, but then I started wondering if there’s form here. Has any other US president used a faux movie trailer to oil the wheels of potentially epoch-making international diplomacy?
3985 2018-06-12 15:56:47 You can't ignore the fact that the market enjoys leadership from multiple sectors/heavyweight stocks at the same time. Whether it's the big banking boys or the steady FMCG names or the bellwether IT names or the volatile Oil&Gas biggies. They all have chipped in.
3986 2018-06-12 15:56:46 Candy just lit a roach and I swear that shit smells like car oil I swear lol
3987 2018-06-12 15:56:46 Ingin aku nyoba face oil buat ilangin bekas tp masih trauma karena pake face oilnya h**le ngga cocok :(
3988 2018-06-12 15:56:42 Getting an oil change at my auto dealer and somebody called thinking this is some kind of mortgage company and this poor office worker can't seem to get them to accept this is an auto dealership.

As someone who works on the phone this is relatable af
3989 2018-06-12 15:56:37 Which I think is debatable in itself!  Do all fats nourish the same?  Is butter the same as olive oil or coconut oil or lard or tallow or schmaltz?  Who knows!
3990 2018-06-12 15:56:29 Keep in mind.....as long as the price of a barrel of Oil remains above $60 bucks, Oil/Energy companies will continue to report beautiful earnings & Dividend Increases. JMHO

3992 2018-06-12 15:56:16 Snake oil selling underwritten by complacent kleptocrats only concerned with a toxic status quo. The furtherest thing in the universe from what has made US great.
3993 2018-06-12 15:56:16 Rice,  beans,   and oil
3994 2018-06-12 15:56:08 The C&C series was also. Originally started out as a fantasy RTS, it's theme transformed into a semi-futuristic military thanks to influences from the Gulf-war. Tiberium is an allegory for oil, GDI is the UN, Brotherhood of Nod are religious fundamentalist terrorists
3995 2018-06-12 15:56:02 haha they were talking about using coconut oil, almond butter, and pea protein all at once and that is a MILKSHAKE
3996 2018-06-12 15:55:50 Feels good to be wearing a clay mask like bye bye oil and pores
3997 2018-06-12 15:55:04 Northbound oil train, tail loco 6733 just flew through #Tukwila headed toward #Georgetown, 8:52am. #WAoiltrainwatch #oiltrains #StopOilTrains
3998 2018-06-12 15:55:01 I’m wearing my 1 Pulse shirt for today and had to get an oil change and the guy that drove me from the car place noticed and told me he lost his son at Pulse. For him and for every person who has lost a love one in a mass shooting we need to make a change. #GunLawReform #OnePulse
3999 2018-06-12 15:54:57 I've been having no problems with my rose hip oil but I will give grapeseed a try
4000 2018-06-12 15:54:51 Paperback. At least trees are a renewable resource, unlike the coal, oil, and gas meant to power a solid majority of the world's electronics.
4001 2018-06-12 15:54:49 I was thinking mostly olive oil, maybe blended with mustard.
4002 2018-06-12 15:54:46 Getting your oil changed at 9am on a Tuesday means you best prepare to eavesdrop a whole lot of retired old lady tea that's being spilled while talking to their other retired old lady friends in the phone. They don't even care.
4003 2018-06-12 15:54:33 Its same aberration if we sent billions Christians to live in #Palestine bc there Jesus born or billions Muslims (including Kurds) to Mecca.
The background of #Israel is creation of a western state in the heart of world oil & "to solve" european 500-yrs-old racism against Jews
4004 2018-06-12 15:54:33 In case you have forgotten Scottish oil n gas
4005 2018-06-12 15:54:32 why do oil changes at dealerships take 15 years
4006 2018-06-12 15:54:31 そんなことあっていいのかよ、ですネ、

4011 2018-06-12 15:54:01 As we dig deeper both on shore and off shore to extract crude oil, except oil sands, in the long run, the future of our oil will be lighter and gassier.
4012 2018-06-12 15:53:53 Let me see what time I’m done with my oil change and we can go
4013 2018-06-12 15:53:50 10-20 Billion barrels of oil in Scottish waters. That's rather a lot of money. What was the issue with Scotland being independent again? Especially when you have one of the world leading locations for renewable energy, fishing, fresh water and so much more #ScotRef
4014 2018-06-12 15:53:49 my thc oil don't last nearly enough as my flowers
4015 2018-06-12 15:53:48 After my oil change I stopped to see my brothers and sisters and they’re all asleep still 
4016 2018-06-12 15:53:26 I said he was a liar at the time, we’re not dependent on Oil and gas though we’ve plenty of resources
4017 2018-06-12 15:53:25 Oil is at an all time high in demand and will be for many yrs yet. One thing to phase it in but it's not being done that way. Secondly the oil companies put more into the economy than what is subsidized. They're starting to leave and take money with them. Not good
4018 2018-06-12 15:53:15 C'mon,  Doug. Watch Trump sell a pyramid marketing scheme. Then watch him talk about his chemistry with Kim. Same snake oil. The "agreement" is smoke and mirrors.
4019 2018-06-12 15:53:07 1979 oil embargo.
4020 2018-06-12 15:52:55 The more we produce our own oil the less terrorist will be able to black market oil as a tool against their own people.  It will drive the cost of oil down.  Thank you.  Good luck at the baseball game tonight!
4021 2018-06-12 15:52:54 But cost of production must be denominated in a unit of account. AppIying a least energy cost organising principle has very different outcomes to a least $ cost organising principle. In my analysis$ is now (since April) priced in oil.

4027 2018-06-12 15:52:27 I mean cannot differentiate one marigold from another because to me they are kinda ugly... but they don't stink to me (I use calendula  and citronella, in jojoba oil for mosquito and tick repellant) I am the "throw out the wildflower seeds and fuck it" gardening type
4028 2018-06-12 15:52:19 1973 oil embargo.
4029 2018-06-12 15:52:18 Why does getting my oil changed give me the worst anxiety. I have an appointment at 1 and I’d rather just sell the car
4030 2018-06-12 15:52:15 My never ending project violin is finally done!  Stripping the old never-drying spirit varnish was the best decision I could have made.  With the new coats of oil varnish it not only looks beautifully luminous, but the sound has drastically improved and matches it's good looks!
4031 2018-06-12 15:52:13 Mmm... Trump Brand Snake Oil. (Made in China) is the best snake oil around!
4032 2018-06-12 15:52:11 Fat flipping snake oil salesman from New York , f@# him and his entire family,
4033 2018-06-12 15:52:07 Correction : Ayurvedic snake oil company
4034 2018-06-12 15:52:03 The real criminals are the people that put things in the pan before the oil is hot 
4035 2018-06-12 15:51:47 And Russia will get a bonus when sanctions are lifted and oil from Russia starts being sold to North Korea in the open following the money connection between trump and what's happening is too easy
4036 2018-06-12 15:51:44 Same woman that calls "Olay"...."oil of a lay" . I'm sick of her shit.

Good stuff!
4046 2018-06-12 15:50:59 Argon oil / castor oil is really good for your ends. Never put any oil near your scalp!! I'm assuming your hair is thick so it'll just make your hair much greasier. I would avoid blow drying as well, or blow dry your hair and spritz it with water / oil mixture to get those waves~

WM has over 50 years near bankrupted an oil rich UK.

4058 2018-06-12 15:49:36 @lisamurkowski there is no proof that drilling the #ArcticRefuge is, in your words, "responsible energy development".

4069 2018-06-12 15:48:49 When trump lifts sanctions on North Korea Russia will be selling massive amounts of oil to them following the money the oil Russia's only export has always been at the root of trumps connection to them
4070 2018-06-12 15:48:47 ND could really use you! The oil industry and endless redneck republicans are running rampant and its almost too much to bear politically! FYI, today is local election day here, too. Safe travels!

4077 2018-06-12 15:48:22 Yep, you are correct about who was President.  However, France pushed for intervention, not the US.  We did not even commit ground troops to the NATO operation.  I am pretty sure France was worried about Libya oil.

Use shea butter & coconut oil  to get rid of unwanted stretch marks & celuite takes 1 week to see results 
4084 2018-06-12 15:47:59 SA is only doing so because they have nothing else but sand to sell, apples and oranges, in the mean time they will squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground,false equivalency with that logic. Canada can do both and not cut of its nose to spite its face.

4236 2018-06-12 15:33:19 Oil price increases are worldwide which are particularly benefiting Russia because of their huge oil resources. Beware USA since Russia, China, etc are working together to replace US dollars as medium of exchange.

4252 2018-06-12 15:31:54 #ECHO Energy.  I'm guessing that if El Molino Sur hits oil then we go back towards 15p quite quickly.  If it doesn't, then we could drop below 10p again. Roll up and place your bets!

3. No cut when oil price was low?

4329 2018-06-12 15:21:41 Noted a wonderful mention of a oil and gas infrastructure company, one I strongly urge, but for as good as the recommendation was of said equity that pays a monthly dividend yielding over 6.5 per cent, it missed the point as investors can treble ROI by writing covered calls.

4338 2018-06-12 15:20:30 For me it was both actually. It's probably just me being fussy but I quite often thing new fabrics are a bit stiff and can smell of something like machine oil or packing? I loved washing all the baby stuff when I was with a bump. Nesting too I expect!x
4339 2018-06-12 15:20:22 My fave thing about the Jasta podcast is that they’ll be talking about how hard dying breed is and then immediately cut to a commercial for CBD oil

4350 2018-06-12 15:19:11 Market Update: price decrease. Today saw the underlying price of Gas Oil drop by over 0.8PPL at 12 noon but has very slowly been creeping back up so there may still be a price rise by the end of the day.

Do I watch too much porn?

No. There's no such thing.
4352 2018-06-12 15:19:03 @POTUS Please Mr. President I know you have a lot on your plate but you need to go after these oil companies that are raising our gas prices. This doesn't help the average American or businesses. #MAGA
4353 2018-06-12 15:19:01 Agreed. All I am saying is that post completion  if early harvest, a decline in machinery will be wtinessed however only a small decline will be witnessed overall with oil and other. Completely agree with the exports part, no sound policy is in place for that.

4355 2018-06-12 15:18:35 I had a mouse problem that took about a month to rectify. One thing that gave me peace of mind: peppermint oil. I mix it in a spray bottle with distilled water.

4368 2018-06-12 15:17:03 Just go to the pharmacy and ask for water-based, glycerin free lube (alcohol, oil, silicon etc pretty much all other types of lube would ruin the silicone cup). Smear some on the rim and outside part of the cup, fold and insert. It should correct itself after you stand up.

4470 2018-06-12 15:06:25 Plus I do my nails too! So I'm always moisturizing my hands and using cuticle oil. I'd blog my nail polish adventures but honestly I'm not even aware I'm doing it sometimes.
4471 2018-06-12 15:06:02 I won't lie, I find washing and detangling to be tedious too. The best and easiest method that I've found is to detangle it as soon as I have undone a previous style. I use a light oil, like argan oil to keep it slick and easier to comb out from the bottom.

4499 2018-06-12 15:04:00 How long will it take for the buyer of the snake oil to realize it killed their loved one. Higher taxes, preexisting conditions, fewer safe health options, higher insurance $, rx$$$. The water in the pot is rising and the  is thumbs up.

4503 2018-06-12 15:03:20 Got a oil change when I’m suppose to be at work. Heading to work now n it’s traffic PISS. “Don’t be mad now you wanted a oil change CJ”
4504 2018-06-12 15:03:19 Need to tell people .. how a metro buss saves fuel of hundreds of cars and bikes .. improving there buying power and also in reducing our oil bills in usd

4506 2018-06-12 15:03:10 I really struggle to understand why dumb Fox News watchers do not understand that it was their money which was frozen by sanctions. I mean I know that Americans love to steal land and oil and possessions and money but if you want a deal you have to give and take.
4507 2018-06-12 15:03:03 I hear black Jamaican Caster Oil helps with thickening.
4508 2018-06-12 15:02:56 I do it all myself. Hot oil treatment. Then i wash. Then i use those hair comb things to dry it. Leave in conditioner. Then the salon to braid it.
4509 2018-06-12 15:02:44 1. Within each country a lot of slicing can and should be done. You will find there is inequality between different groups' incomes everywhere.

2. There immigrant workers are not citizens of the oil countries so they are supposed to be accounted for in their countries of origin.

In California - Joanna Newsom

I don't belong to anyone
My heart is heavy as an oil drum
And I don't want to be alone
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn
And I have torn my soul apart, from
Pulling artlessly with fool commands

4513 2018-06-12 15:02:05 A child, Billy Caldwell, in Northern Ireland with severe #epilepsy WAS the first person in the UK to receive a prescription for cannabis oil and his uncontrollable seizures reduced; now his doctor's not allowed to prescribe it and the police have seized the medicine #disability

4515 2018-06-12 15:01:37 Im no fan of JT but ill stand behind him on this one, maybe he should finish the Energy East Pipeline and make us more self reliant on our own oil.

4518 2018-06-12 15:01:19 So I think

The reason microwaved eggs turn out so weird is because there's no butter/oil.
4519 2018-06-12 15:01:12 Mmmm, I had one today too, direct from the pasty HQ in St Agnes. They really are the best - & no palm oil

4521 2018-06-12 15:00:50 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
4522 2018-06-12 15:00:43 Fact. 

Washed a pot and filled it about 1/4 full with oil. Failed to properly dry the pot. Scared the life out of me when the water droplets started to boil/fry at the bottom of the pot. Very dangerous.

Scots are getting fleeced and you are supporting it

4531 2018-06-12 14:59:55 You can have pure morphine/heroin injections prescribed all day long to  relieve severe pain... but you can’t have CBD oil prescriptions because... ?
4532 2018-06-12 14:59:52 Oil isn’t as much of a factor as it once was. I don’t think it plays any role at all in the Korea conflict.
4533 2018-06-12 14:59:49 Mokwa - Jebba bridge how far anyone about d alternative @FMPWH promised within 72hours as d bridge collapsed recently. Despite huge oil dollar, dem dem forget Mokwa - Jebba bridge. @MBuhari will fix it like June 12. Any info as per d road pls

4535 2018-06-12 14:59:32 Top of the hour: NATGAS 1H momentum lower halts, will form bottom & consolidate now.
OIL 1H dramatic break higher, WHALES in play this morning, H&S pattern fails to form. WATCH
GOLD breaks corellation with USD & moves significantly higher. WATCH 
SPX in line with ES_F lower today
4536 2018-06-12 14:59:24 I am confused the name of the country says United. I hold no party so not one of "them" take a moment to consider how neither party if you sift through the actual legislation goes against Oil or Banks or Corporate interests.. Trump has always been right about it all being rigged.
4537 2018-06-12 14:59:24 We have more natural gas and oil than the OPEC nations right here we need to drill for our own!!  I’m not against wind or solar but it’s just not cost effective now.

Oh, you meant something else entirely by "hippy". My bad.
4539 2018-06-12 14:59:20 A footnote: some of our WW1 adventures in the Middle East (ME) were due to our needs to secure oil supplies for newly oil-fired battleships of Britain's navy. So the fleet that ensured strategic victory in WW1 was also the catalyst for 100 years of diplomatic complexity in the ME

4543 2018-06-12 14:59:06 Tend to agree, but can’t be said there’s “little chance” of any possible #Oilers deal. Chia’s 3 Oil years & latter time in Boston show it. Remember Taylor/Tyler debate? He traded BOTH. And Ebs. Kessel. He’s high-talent averse. Oil fans need to worry about Connor, not draft pick.
4544 2018-06-12 14:59:06 Obama's giving advice to Democrats on how to win 2020!? LOL! 60% D voters left the Party and voted for Trump because of eight years of wars, oil drilling, mass surveillance and the worst unemployment and economy under Obama's leadership!

4549 2018-06-12 14:58:54 The roof has already been replaced. I only had to pay $1000 of the $8500 it cost to replace it, but that’s still a decent chunk of change. Whale oil beef hooked and all that. Thanks, hail storm

4551 2018-06-12 14:58:32 Like rusty engine and a oil change?
4552 2018-06-12 14:58:31 Corn, Oil, and the LIBOR were the October surprise in 2008. Remember $4 per gallon gas?
As the Dems put away their economic long knives, OPEC jumped in to try to finish off US Oil. Under $50 per barrel puts people OUT OF WORK.
Between $50 and $100 per barrel = BACK TO WORK.
4553 2018-06-12 14:58:29 Yal already know I’m fixing to breastfeed yal, clean, do laundry, file ya taxes, give your car an oil change, As PER usual 
4554 2018-06-12 14:58:26 Why would you separate? Why do you think there is a need? You could have left when you had oil. But now that you don’t anymore...it’s wah-wah-wah.

4560 2018-06-12 14:57:51 Oil is a big reason. Oil prices are seen as an anchor of inflation by a lot of investors. When they're up, Nigeria can control inflation. When they're down, capital outflows and inflation tend to pick up.

1. Gather up a cast iron Dutch ovens with lids

2. Fill with frying oil 2/3 to 3/4 full

3. Start preheating donut oil how and when  instructed

When ready to fry, only put in enough dough to leave 1" to 1-1/2" donut vs pan gap

4590 2018-06-12 14:54:36 Energy prices were volatile throughout April 2018 and maintained their bullish trend, with only brief respites. UK’s wholesale power prices increased by 6-8% and UK gas prices moved up nearer 10%. Oil prices moved up even more providing general underlying support to the sentiment
4591 2018-06-12 14:54:35 The Bakkan oil fields hold more oil than all other nations combined. Why then do we Americans have to pay $3.50 a gallon at the pump?
Put aside the obvious that it becomes part of the world market. The Balkkan is on Federal land and we could be sharing in the find. $1.00 gallons!

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?

4633 2018-06-12 14:50:18 Are UFOs and ALIENS in the BIBLE
No
Because Nikola Tesla was not born yet

4640 2018-06-12 14:49:52 Bond prices rise because yields are falling.  Interest rates on Nigerian bonds are falling for a variety of reasons some unrelated to crude oil prices. With the direction of inflation and pressure on MPC to cut rates, this trend can only continue
4641 2018-06-12 14:49:38 Increases to minimize wages, collective bargaining, affordable healthcare, CHIP, more funding for CA schools, restrictions on predatory loans and banks, clean air....

But I get it, you'd rather just have your kids forced into the army and shipped off to fight for oil.

4676 2018-06-12 14:46:10 Yeah. In my case, oil from one of the two elevators had overheated. There's a smoke detector in the machine room (I assume to comply with national code).
4677 2018-06-12 14:46:07 well I'm on a Trump diet, and now that barrel prices are up Canadian Sand oil is both profitable and an environmental problem, this is the best I've got to go with until something really important happens

westminster has taken 92% of scots oil and gas revenues for 50 years and STILL managed to near bankrupt the country,leaving scots with 8% of their own resource!
When would England EVER accept a deal like that?
And you are surprised scots want out !
4777 2018-06-12 14:34:33 Nope, the oil splashes too much
4778 2018-06-12 14:34:26 Your PM would probably be singing a different tune if his economy was as affected as Canada’s by Trump’s actions.  Were their no1 trading partner and our economy is deeply imbedded into theirs.  For instance we make lots of their cars...big provider of energy, softwood and oil...

4782 2018-06-12 14:34:14 You need to learn how to do cooking with mustard oil. Mustard oil is not as tame as other oils.

4787 2018-06-12 14:33:50 Thx for the intel.  
- my guess is mkt wanted to see the first oil correction and see it oil hold at a good level before running a name like this higher.  So far so good

4798 2018-06-12 14:32:29 Feeling so much for Charlotte and her son in this awful situation. THC oil is required for lots of medical reasons and is unbelievable how it’s illegal in the UK.

4818 2018-06-12 14:29:51 My take. If we can subsidize crude transport for big oil, why not big farma that makes food?
4819 2018-06-12 14:29:37 love this one. also quick q for you: whats the deal with AUD correlations? dont you call that an inflationary currency as well? I get the CADUSD correlation to oil and oil to inflation, but what is the one when you talk about AUD? thank you

4877 2018-06-12 14:23:00 Due to BREXIT, the pound is down from around $1.60 to around $1.30. Oil is priced in $$ and not pounds. Am guessing this makes fuel significantly more expensive. Well done BEXITEERS
4878 2018-06-12 14:22:26 Thoughts:
- what type of advertising? Just to say advertising is too broad. Many media companies are ad only businesses and while not striking oil, are fine
- w/ journalism gaming algorithms, that’s a fixable concern if reliance isn’t solely on platform $ & view KPIs

4883 2018-06-12 14:21:44 1) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I do look forward to your answers to those two questions

4888 2018-06-12 14:20:43 Declining oil production, lawsuits by creditors, shortages of spare parts for terminals & executive braindrain have reduced PDVSA's ability to export oil recently, U.S.-based ConocoPhillips' actions to seize PDVSA assets to cash in on a $2 billion arbitration award added issue.

4893 2018-06-12 14:19:44 It's because of Quebec's dairy cartel we have tariffs.  Trudeau only cares about Quebec while killing the oil industry that pays all the bills.

4896 2018-06-12 14:19:02 The media here never report on our many war crimes (such as yesterday's bombing of MSF center in Yemen) but glorify the military as almost godlike.

4897 2018-06-12 14:18:54 (Reuters) - The U.S. unit of Venezuela's state-run oil producer PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] is increasing purchases of crude on the open market because it cannot get sufficient deliveries from its struggling parent company, traders said on Monday.

4912 2018-06-12 14:16:39 Oil prices have faced one jolt already this year. A U.S. decision to pull out from an international nuclear deal with Iran and reimpose sanctions helped prices climb to their highest since 2014. Sliding Venezuelan output has added to supply concerns.

4932 2018-06-12 14:15:37 Arms dealers, oil/bank magnates and shady governments are the ones responsible.

Portuguese count 500 years in Africa, my own family born and raised there. We deeply know the problems. Being separated from Angola and leaving other lands to their own fate in the 70s was a mistake.

5062 2018-06-12 14:00:51 I nvr knew about black seed oil. I keep mine pretty basic as you can see. Lol
5063 2018-06-12 14:00:44 I love Charlie Munger. If we’d listened to him& didn’t lift 40-yr oil embargo in 2016& didn’t let even nonallies buy US energy co in USA,

foreign companies & SOEs in USA wouldn’t be happily exporting our energy future&ensuring we’ll be dependent on foreign energy again.
5064 2018-06-12 14:00:43 Your other option is turning NK into a waste land. Same with ME. Technically you can still drill thru glass to get oil. So what do you want a thumbs up or a wasteland? Not that it matters since NN has ended and we are all going into the zombie apocalypse anyway.
5065 2018-06-12 14:00:32 who knew that argan oil is great for the skin ? I'm all glowy and whatnot .

5072 2018-06-12 13:59:58 Displaced oil sands workers who left their families for years to provide for them are now in a bad spot. It is a situation that provides no political photo-ops.
5073 2018-06-12 13:59:57 I get them every year. They put up a mean fight with dogs. I spray peppermint oil on the fence and it keeps them away
5074 2018-06-12 13:59:44 Me too. I didn’t even know there was a shower gel (or body oil or lotion) until right now. I have a bunch of tiny samples of it so I haven’t even bought a full size bottle of the perfume yet.
5075 2018-06-12 13:59:41 The war was already over at that point ...in europe and japan had nothing left , as oil reserves were diminished...but good job reading history !
5076 2018-06-12 13:59:40 If Tyler's right it's pretty imperative that the Oil move him because if they slide from here it become worse contract in NHL

5080 2018-06-12 13:59:23 With the highest unemployment, homeless, welfare and illegal immigrants along the coast. I live in one of those cities, lucky we have big oil and gas to offset those numbers but our farmers do work the hardest. I know facts are hard to swallow sometimes.
5081 2018-06-12 13:59:14 When a con man is selling snake oil to you, what's the acceptable length of time to appear interested before you interrupt him & tell him to gfoh?
5082 2018-06-12 13:58:59 RIP my 2004 Cavalier. Engine froze up yesterday, was leaking oil really bad so something blew. Will get the official assessment later today but if anyone can recommend a good dealer for a used set of wheels in or around Phoenix I'd appreciate it! Thanks!

5087 2018-06-12 13:58:17 there’s an essential oil called clarrycalm and it’s a blend of rosemary, lavender, and sage (maybe a few other herbs) and you rub it on your pulse points and it’s very effective :)

5098 2018-06-12 13:56:06 The last admin. tried to expand NATO into Ukraine which caused the Crimea annexation. Who can blame Putin when Europe and the U.S. were sending troops to his borders and Europe loudly proclaims they want off Russia's gas and oil? It's obvious why it happened.
5099 2018-06-12 13:56:04 I don’t use anything other than Bragg’s.  I may have to try that out. I was doing ACV, blackseed oil, honey and cinnamon. That made a big difference. I need to get back to the basics.

5101 2018-06-12 13:55:49 I love how my old job is next to my current job rn. Whenever I need oil or anything for my car, I can just pull up and get it 
5102 2018-06-12 13:55:45 Use baby oil to shine up taps and chrome appliances 
5103 2018-06-12 13:55:42 My sister Teri Stewart thinks that they give you warranties for oil changes on new cars  Please tell me where I can get that??? 
5104 2018-06-12 13:55:34 I've worked as a petroleum geologist, but I've never been CEO of a major, multinational oil company. There is a difference.
5105 2018-06-12 13:55:27 Ooh gonna try the hada labo cleansing oil next, when my current one habis
5106 2018-06-12 13:55:14 No, not cool it’s like oil and water.
5107 2018-06-12 13:55:12 A tasty way to use #turmeric is to sauté the fresh root in oil with your other spices and then add in your veggies. You can also slice and dice it when making dhal, curry, and many other dishes (but have your hand soap ready—it tends to stain!).
5108 2018-06-12 13:55:07 I'm longing for a time when we stop using oil. Not in our lifetime?
5109 2018-06-12 13:55:02 I doubt that will live to me much better without my complexes. Without my oil refineries...

5111 2018-06-12 13:54:55 We'll keep our oil that powers your cars. We'll keep our electricity and instead leave our lights on 24/7. We'll shut off the flow to the American Falls at Niagara! (Actually, that last one is no big loss.)

5121 2018-06-12 13:53:49 If NK was sitting on top of a giant oil field we would already either be best friends, or we would have overthrown them a long time ago. Stop pretending this country ever had a moral compass when it comes to our relations with dictators just so you can take shots at Trump
5122 2018-06-12 13:53:45 Tea Tree OIl (Malaleuca alternafolia) has antifungal properties useful for toenail fungus.  Apply twice daily to cleaned, clipped and filed (to normal nail thickness) toenails.  Make take 6 months to 1 year to resolve.

5126 2018-06-12 13:52:56 America subsidized Boeing to the tune of 64 billion creating unfair competition.

5135 2018-06-12 13:51:48 It's maybe a bit too easy for Scotland to look good with this kind of accounting: we export oil & gas, but don't count the production or consumption emissions, and don't count the production emissions of our imports either (eg, every car in Scotland).
5136 2018-06-12 13:51:48 Farmers aren’t making a fortune. You go ahead and support OPEC! I’ll support our hard working farmers! My spouse has been in the fuel business for over 30 years! Ethanol is a high octane non toxic way to boost the octane of the 83-85 octane gas that the oil companies are refining

5139 2018-06-12 13:51:23 Atrocities per NK defectors: “These included a prisoner's newborn baby being fed to guard dogs, execution of starving prisoners caught digging for edible plants on the mountainside & violent measures designed to induce abortions, including injecting motor oil into women's wombs.”

5141 2018-06-12 13:51:13 yes, although the UofJ was relocated from Khartoum with all kinds practical and administrative problems. Still hardly a fair comparison. Not a huge amount of the oil ever flowed into the education system

5148 2018-06-12 13:50:33 Tried coffee with MCT oil (without the butter) for the first time this morning. Adds some body to the coffee taste, but no flavor of its own. A bit rich, a tablespoon is 130 calories!
5149 2018-06-12 13:50:31 Always has been. All the middle east wars have been about oil.
5150 2018-06-12 13:50:22 If we are looking to reduce carbon output I wonder how the cruise ship industry has escaped scrutiny. Burn lots of oil to go around in circles.
5151 2018-06-12 13:50:05 I think your slant drilling thing is probably fiction, like the original conspiracy theory about oil and gas.

Russians offer Banks gold, and Carter Page the deal on a sell off in oil shares both in July 2016?

5163 2018-06-12 13:48:23 All happened as a of result of solidly rely on crude oil so immediately when the price crashed and no reserve. No margic will stop the hardships. I believe thinks are now taking a good shapes.

5165 2018-06-12 13:48:10 Do a study on pharmacists and apothecaries of that period who set up stall in fairgrounds and roadsides.  In fact that's where the term "snake oil salesman" came from.

You were saying?
5170 2018-06-12 13:47:49 Bye bye @SimplyGlutenFre I cannot follow you anymore after you tried to sell me snake oil this morning. I do not need to feed myself or my children your bullshit supplements to "flush out toxins".  (1/3)
5171 2018-06-12 13:47:48 You have to leave it in for as long as you can stand for benefits, and yeah really doesn't wash out easy till it's somewhat absorbed. Coconut oil def easier.
5172 2018-06-12 13:47:36 Oil change happening finally, but they're running behind schedule so I have to wait 45 minutes before they can get me in. At least I have a comfy chair~
5173 2018-06-12 13:47:30 Carry gallons of oil for the inner journey. Rusty parts abound.

5193 2018-06-12 13:43:58 What an idiotic question.
It's the international demand and supply, which is driving the oil prices.
5194 2018-06-12 13:43:45 My buddy’s dad said he drank out of the cup in the dressing room after one of the Oil cup wins in the 80’s.
5195 2018-06-12 13:43:42 The only thing I'm doing on a daily basis is using body lotion/oil after showering because I have really dry skin 
5196 2018-06-12 13:43:21 When Zanganeh returned as oil minister in 2013, he brought with him much of the old guard, many of which were either already retired or nearing retirement. Over time, some have moved on, but many are still in place. I feel these two are only the first of many.

5199 2018-06-12 13:42:43 Nope. Trump lovers are so shady it’s not even funny. Obama was criticized like never before when he said he would meet with the oil man in NK.

5202 2018-06-12 13:42:13 @LindaFoods - would you consider NOT using palm oil in a lot of your products? I rely on your foods but have now taken pretty much everything I normally get from you away from my usual shop because you use Palm Oil which is a seriously unsustainable & cruel product to use.

5205 2018-06-12 13:41:31 They don't operate with different mechanisms though. There's no difference between how the world price for milk is determined and how the market price for oil is determined. Prices going up and down means nothing. The gas price went up and down multiple times in the last month

Required denuclearization
Required verification inspections from IAEA and UN

Required unfreezing seized assets
Required easement of sanctions for oil exports

5238 2018-06-12 13:38:40 hmmm... last week I tasted something I'd have never imagined, a really TASTY VEGAN DISH: brown rice with lensils, mashed peanuts with olive oil and quinoa  and sauteed rocket.  It was too incredibly delicious. My mouth is watering.

5245 2018-06-12 13:37:43 Apparently you can get mozzarella in sheet form. Yanno, like pizza/pie dough

So if you put cherry tomatoes, basil leaves, and olive oil on it and rolled it up it'd basically be a caprese burrito. A caprito if you will

5250 2018-06-12 13:36:51 so why call a press conference then ..just pours more oil on the lit flame 
5251 2018-06-12 13:36:43 Your arguement is like Trump saying we should have just taken ownership of the oil in Iraq after the war to pay back the cost to the US. You can, but you give up any moral standing in saying that other puppet dictators need to follow treaties too.
5252 2018-06-12 13:36:33 Frankly I am not sure I would even buy snake oil from the DfT.

5258 2018-06-12 13:35:47  Don’t know what people say that helps the other fighter. Because if I put grease or oil on what ever. It makes it just as hard for me to grab the other fighter. So I really don’t see the advantage here and they check them before they enter the cage.
5259 2018-06-12 13:35:46 Can I interest you in some tropical oil that will change your life and help raise your IQ?  Only $2,000 per bottle for you because you are a friend.

5275 2018-06-12 13:34:03 Sorry, but how does it follow that switching from chicken to vegetables lowers calories? Breaded and fried in oil is calories. Carbohydrates (the kings of high calorie foods) come from plants. This is why most people are completely food and nutrition ignorant, thus overweight.
5276 2018-06-12 13:34:02 Their currencies have plunged to record lows--with Argentina’s peso down 29% against the dollar this year and Turkey’s lira down 16%--making oil especially expensive since it's typically priced in the greenback.
5277 2018-06-12 13:34:02 Cleanser habe ich momentan einen aus Korea, kann dir heute Abend nen foto von dem schicken. Wenn deine Haut eher zum öligen neigt, würde ich einen Foam Cleanser empfehlen, ansonsten ein Cleansing Oil. Wenn du sicher gehen willst, würde ich immer double cleansing empfehlen.

5303 2018-06-12 13:32:23 In past oil rallies, strong growth from oil exporters helped to offset pressure on other developing nations. From 2010 to 2012, when Brent crude prices rose by almost $30 a barrel, emerging markets grew an average 6.4%, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Unless venom is made out of oil then spiderman is the real villan.

We need venom for his oil. (At least he looks super oily)

Now 2 of the resource problems are solved!

We already have too much spiders.
5317 2018-06-12 13:31:05 Most developing nations buy more oil than they sell to foreign buyers, and the rally in prices has left many to absorb higher energy and fuel costs.   That comes as countries face the prospect of slower growth amid recent currency and bond-market routs.
5318 2018-06-12 13:30:46 @f1elvis I guess this is pretty classified info by the teams, but I was wondering (in general) how much oil the F1 teams are burning in a race weekend, and how often they have to change it? It was triggering my mind when looking into the "creative oil usage" nowadays!

5327 2018-06-12 13:29:46 Unlike your turd, Obama, who sold out Egypt, Israel, Suadi Arabia (y'know, allies) for an empty deal with Iran that only secures Europe's oil supply, Trump has did this deal with the support of all of North Korea's neighbors for something that will have actual results.
5328 2018-06-12 13:29:38 Coconut oil is weird.
5329 2018-06-12 13:29:21 Oil prices have pulled back in recent weeks, but Brent crude remains up 14% this year at $76.46 a barrel on Monday.

5345 2018-06-12 13:28:04 Well, you know, he's the one who said, "Why didn't we take the oil?" (Looting - a war crime), and has spoken & written for years about always taking business risks with "Other People's Money," not his own. An avaricious bamboozler who, of course, would spout this nonsense, too.
5346 2018-06-12 13:28:02 This is an easy win for me.

5370 2018-06-12 13:24:38 With global daily demand, and consumption, of 99 million barrels of oil per day, and still rising any reduction in exploration and production would just lead to increased prices. Its the 7 billion consumers that fund and drive the exploration.
5371 2018-06-12 13:24:27 OPEC forecasts unchanged: expects growth of 1.65Mln barrels a day, meaning demand stand at 98.85Mln bpd this year.
Commercial oil inventories in the OECD fell in April by 6.7 million barrels month-on-month. That is 26Mln barrels below OPEC’s target of the last 5year average
5372 2018-06-12 13:24:25 To be clear, Norway (5m people) has interests directly opposed to the UK's, especially on fish and oil that are the main reasons Norway is affluent. 
The three countries are subject to minimal scrutiny because frankly Lichtenstein does not export much poultry.

5509 2018-06-12 13:05:18 And therfore the church, any church, should have nothing to do with politic. But in the USA it's different. Lobby groups like the nra, evangelicans, pharma and oil are deciding.

5513 2018-06-12 13:04:35 Increased tensions in the region would put pressure on oil prices leading to more profits for oil producers and exporters.

3.They don't have support from big Islamic countries

5534 2018-06-12 13:03:04 A dystopian future where very few wild animals exist due to habitat destruction would barely change most people’s lives.

5608 2018-06-12 12:56:02 Hi @YOSushi... Just wondering what's changed at the St Paul's store? Went there 2 weeks ago, great food and service. Today, food was slow to come and was average and full of oil. Wish I had queued for @wagamama_uk now!
5609 2018-06-12 12:55:57 Some of the European countries are already cutting back, Some VLCC owners announced no more dealings with Iran oil. I was surprised to see Reliance making an announcement about not buying Iranian oil. But if oil gets short, Iran oil will be in the market one way or other
5610 2018-06-12 12:55:44 If they do anything. I pointed out serial pavement parkers to @Royal_Greenwich who did **** all about it. Added to that, the parkers have a car that leaked oil so everyone walking through it will soil their shoes. Council doesn’t care.

5615 2018-06-12 12:55:13 IMO big tell that airlines are a strong short... Two choices: 1) Raise fares, potentially impacting demand and/or 2) Leave fares unchanged allowing oil prices to continue eating into margins.. Accompanied by leverage customary w/ airlines amidst rising rates....

5631 2018-06-12 12:53:44 They found oil there a few years ago and the pay is huge for workers so mostly men have flocked there.

5636 2018-06-12 12:53:12 The best way to recycle is not use the oil product in the first place which we all can reduce its consumption immensely by changing at least some of our bad habits.

5724 2018-06-12 12:42:53 @NickHurdUK Give Billy back his meds!! Why should a child die, just because you lot are not getting the chance to cream tax of his cannabis oil, bunch of despicable power mad money grabbing scum the lot you
5725 2018-06-12 12:42:36 olive oil cake... w cream cheese frostin.. omg 
5726 2018-06-12 12:42:28 A moderate increase in gas prices has been a great thing, which has helped jumpstart mediocre economy growth. Here in Texas jobs were lost & oil drillers went bankrupt w/oil prices below $60/barrel. We are in the sweet spot at $60-70/barrel & the excellent GDP growth shows it.
5727 2018-06-12 12:42:22 Oh dear me. Poor Charlie isn’t well at all. 

Let’s see. We could try a tablespoon of cod liver oil every morning. 

Or a Native American cleansing ritual using
A sage smudge stick, feather, & shell. 

Clear out the negative energy from himself,home & work place

Could it work?

5734 2018-06-12 12:42:02 The communist regime has almost destroyed the oil industry, and today Venezuela produces about 1.4 million barrels per day. The relentless drop in recent years increases world wide oil prices slightly. And there's no new Venezuelan money going to the US.
5735 2018-06-12 12:42:00  Pizza topped with manchego cheese, extra-virgin olive oil, whole clams, and pineapple.
5736 2018-06-12 12:41:54 Mines was really stubborn at one point. I found that switch to pure, all natural products like wild turmeric and lemon oil REALLY sped everything up.
5737 2018-06-12 12:41:47 You can give Heroin addicts Methadone. But can't give a child Medicinal Cannabis Oil??? Stop playing God with kids lives. How do you sleep at night??? Give the people what they want and desperately need. You wanted to be a politician to change the world make your mark. Do it.
5738 2018-06-12 12:41:43 I'm actually eager to try some natural oils that I hear are excellent sunscreens like carrot oil or raspberry seed oil.
5739 2018-06-12 12:41:36 ３年間だけ待ってやろう・・・
5740 2018-06-12 12:41:26 no actually, at night i use it as a moisturizer! i use a face wash, then micellar water, then toner, then i put one drop of oil and massage it into my palms and then my face! i leave it on and it absorbs fairly quickly and my face feels great when i wake up! i have combo skin
5741 2018-06-12 12:41:06 Hey Jimbob get one up on Syntac and make 1000's of ichor easily. Make about 50 yes "FIFTY" fish traps and plant them at the sides of any water source. Come back 2 hours later and harvest the "unappetising fish" and cook them on campfires. The rest can be pressed to get oil.
5742 2018-06-12 12:41:02 My sister left her Argan oil 5-oil miracle conditioner at our house before going back to London and that's what I'm happy about today
5743 2018-06-12 12:40:55 @VictoriasSecret I'm trying to figure out why my bra is leaking oil. Is it toxic? It ruined my shirt. Not to mention, the embarrassment of looking like I'm lactating when I'm not pregnant. 
5744 2018-06-12 12:40:53 Of course you could be right.

Tell me,
Why do you think I'm wrong?.

Along with the faithful puppy(UK),neither,since WW2, have got involved in any conflict where oil,money or self enriched influence is not involved.
5745 2018-06-12 12:40:45 @HackingDave Any opinion on IANS? Their marketing spam calls you out specifically, so figured I would ask you if they are legit, or just another snake oil vendor.

5769 2018-06-12 12:37:54 Price cuts!!!!. We’re just being fleeced at the filling stations. It’s no wonder price of goods are steadily rising. Prices always rise immediately but when oil prices drop it takes weeks for prices to drop at the pump.
5770 2018-06-12 12:37:54 Use tea tree oil and rice instead of a mask.
5771 2018-06-12 12:37:49 I got fed up with GPS oil and syringing and then a psychiatrist friend of mine gave me the contact; it’s magic
5772 2018-06-12 12:37:47 Wood is actually an obstacle to genuine change because his Opportunity NE organisation is still refusing to promote renewables technology to the same extent as oil and gas,  Consequently it will be difficult for Scotland & particularly Aberdeen to compete globally in this sector

5854 2018-06-12 12:26:24 Find another job in another sector. Is the population full of stupid working people? Have some vision people, the oil industry isn't forever. There are shit loads of emerging technologies far superior to oil that could give us more opportunities.

5858 2018-06-12 12:26:13 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

5863 2018-06-12 12:25:46 The incremental cost per litre is going to be very small for all of those things.  I read an estimate of $20 billion clean up liabilities for oil sands. Production has been at least 20 billion up until today, so $1 per barrel liability = $0.02 per gallon, $0.005 per litre
5864 2018-06-12 12:25:39 Do you have some baby oil?

5869 2018-06-12 12:25:10 You know you’re tired when you almost put tea tree oil drops in your vape 
5870 2018-06-12 12:25:04 Yes, only the very pure oil form of it. It took awhile to see the difference but I can't do the THC for some reason it affects me badly, but just the CBD works ok.
5871 2018-06-12 12:24:56 So what if they do?  Actually not a single trawler out of Aberdeen any more.  I suppose we had to take our choice, North Sea trawling or North Sea oil.  Aberdeen went for the most lucrative one, Oil obviously.  Sadly.

5875 2018-06-12 12:24:16 Yeah, gas is rising. Must be Trump's fault because Trump fired Tillerson. He called his buddies in the oil biz and is exacting his revenge through them.

5883 2018-06-12 12:23:41 Thanks to being oblivious to my oil, my engine is probably fried... Not to mention all the other problems that have crept up over the past few months.

PepsiCo, Mars, Nestle, Unilever - companies that have promised not to buy palm oil from forest destroyers - are all supporting the destruction.

That needs to stop.

5891 2018-06-12 12:22:36 Why do business leaders say #data is the new #oil - this implies that the players that extract the data own the data and that a small number of very powerful companies have all the power? Surely that’s not what we want #CogX2018

5894 2018-06-12 12:21:58 Yes, the poorly educated Trump voters are the ones who should be making decisions led to a senile snake oil salesman who likes to be spanked. Got it.

"#Trump is a very good salesman . . . "

No he's not.  One believes implicitly in a good salesman.

Trump is a coarse and crude snake oil salesman.

I beleive him as much as I'd believe Mr Ed the talking horse.

5909 2018-06-12 12:20:15 Nope, no no no. A heart of gold would having nothing to do with this administration. It would be summarily repulsed, repelled, like oil and water. He may be a nice guy on display to you, but he has a rotten soul. Simple logic.

5926 2018-06-12 12:17:03 Let's make 1 thing clear. Trump's a snake oil salesman who only thinks of himself. He saw and still sees this presidency as a cash cow. 
He knew who to pander to, he knew people don't fact check (his base, the minority) He preyed on their fears & closeted phobias

5983 2018-06-12 12:10:12 This needs to be sorted. Surely this oil can be supplied under medical prescription as it is apparently an effective treatment. There are thousands of patients taking "rat poison" as a blood thinner. That must be far more dangerous but medically controlled is a life saver.

6125 2018-06-12 11:48:37 Yes, but in regards to terminology, "biomass" is probably among the more problematic because the heterogeneity within that category is huuuge. Nuclear is not all Chernobyl, nor is biomass all oil palm grown on deforested peatlands.

6198 2018-06-12 11:37:08 The EU will rightly ban palm oil imports. The UK government will rescind that ban once we leave the EU. Why ? So some of them can put more money into their bank accounts that are already bursting with self interest.
6199 2018-06-12 11:37:01 That's a pretty far fetched hypothetical. Until sanctions are lifted NK is a monetary dead zone. Only minimal aid is sent it now - and some Chinese goods, Russian goods and fuel, and Iranian oil.

The cooling is needed, not because of global warming, but because of the heat produced while drilling, and during the production of oil and gas. 
You are drilling with fluids with temps of 30-6- deg C, and producing oil at temps of 100 Deg.

6427 2018-06-12 11:00:23 Actually that isn’t true. The US GDP is only around 15% based on trade, compared to MUCH larger percentages in other countries. The US is probably the only country in the world capable of being completely self sustaining. It is now cheap enough for us to refine our own oil too

6517 2018-06-12 10:43:21 But my advice is like all good things in life
Long n slow

Put some cuts into the leg and push some garlic and rosemary in each
Sprinkle some lemon juice over it all and maybe some oil
The good book will tell you to not put salt on it as the salt draws the moisture out and dries
6518 2018-06-12 10:43:18 Yeah yeah, the question is if you use soybean oil like so many others. If so, I'll pass.

6541 2018-06-12 10:38:11  Best part is is the oil tip is true and will improve although not necessarily save the outcome. Adding fat and heating especially as combination is a great rule of thumb for cooks like this.
6542 2018-06-12 10:38:07 For the first couple centuries, our dollars were backed by gold.  When Nixon took us off the gold standard, he turned the U.S. dollar into a fiat currency with nothing backing it  (well, Saudi oil, but that is above your head considering you don't understand basic economics).
6543 2018-06-12 10:38:00 BJP got 10 lac crores from oil to pay that debt. Congress wasn’t lucky to get that gift. Let oil touch 130 dollar that you will fail too. Don’t boast of your success yet. Success is not reaching poor.

6551 2018-06-12 10:36:17 Many ppl in UK, who don't understand this, why? Bcs used to demanding attention & screaming to get their own way.  Know what they say: 'squeaking hinge gets the most oil'! Leave voters there's a new democracy: start squeaking, LOUD & don't stop!

6603 2018-06-12 10:25:23 The mum was just quoted as saying she uses the illegal element of cannabis oil in this country. That's the issue, or she could just go to H&B and pick up the readly available oil. There's no conspiracy here. She is using Canadian regulated medicine in a country where it's illegal

6617 2018-06-12 10:23:38 CBD oil is legal (although very expensive) and if that is the ingredient helping epilepsy, can the mum not get this? Plus was her Canadian cannabis oil with or without THC? If without, customs had no right to confiscate it anyway!

6627 2018-06-12 10:22:27 Our dog was having 3 seizures a day until we gave him cannabis oil he hasn’t had one in 3 months. They really need to make this available in uk
6628 2018-06-12 10:22:20 I agree! There is no need for added processed fats like butter or oil. Just seek out fatty meat (lamb and mutton cuts have the perfect ketogenic ratio naturally, and certain cuts of beef) or fatty fish (Atlantic mackerel and sablefish) Grill and eat!
6629 2018-06-12 10:22:12 This new caterer for work, her 150 rice na scam.. the good side is we get ofada stew with no extra cost, unlike the last person that was selling ofada special price.. the downside is the stew no he colour, it looks like oil and rice but tasty.. let me go and buy extra 100 rice

6656 2018-06-12 10:17:15 @thismorning Can someone just get some cannabis oil for young Billy. Surely someone can help this wee child. Imagine the outcry if this was an animal being refused medication to prolong and improve his life. Absolute shambles. Home office, my message, do the correct thing

Simple alcohols like ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, denatured alcohol (alcohol denat), SD alcohol are antibacterial and used to get rid of excess oil. But too much in a product can dry the skin. Proceed with caution during cold weather.

6761 2018-06-12 10:00:45 Why are we buying oil from foreign countries when we have oil under our own soil?  Yet, our oil is being sold or used for bargaining with other countries.  What are we supposed to do when all our own natural resources are depleted?
6762 2018-06-12 10:00:45 Simons work is based on his research and he continues to develop it. I’m happy it’s worthwhile. He’s not peddling snake oil, recycling other peoples ideas or just rehashing his one tired talk, which is possibly what sets him apart from many others.
6763 2018-06-12 10:00:39 Medical Cannabis contains THC, the oil that Billy takes also contains THC. Oils or treatments without THC is just Hemp oil (CBD).

6804 2018-06-12 09:52:06 Yemen's mineral resources: metals, such as cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, silver, and zinc; industrial minerals, e.g. celestine, clays, dolomite, feldspar, gypsum, limestone, magnesite, perlite,sandstone, scoria, talc,& zeolite; & fossil fuels, such as crude oil & natural gas.
6805 2018-06-12 09:51:58 My fear is that the US economy is very dependent on oil and wars George. This dictates their foreign policy. Apart from historical legacy for Trump, what do they stand to gain? I cannot see it?
6806 2018-06-12 09:51:52 Very crazy..their fans cost them everything..they be attacking their own players
6807 2018-06-12 09:51:45 African natural resources that include oil, natural gas and rare earth minerals are being plundered by Chinese and US corporations. A few, wealthy Africans sell out their countries to the highest bidders while the majority live on less than $2.00 per day.

6813 2018-06-12 09:50:59 Sir, if Trump-Kim meeting going in right direction, should we believe that crude oil price won't rise in near future?
6814 2018-06-12 09:50:53 The Carter / Clinton solution was bribe them with free oil and money.  Look where we are.
6815 2018-06-12 09:50:49 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
6816 2018-06-12 09:50:47 As a FYI, I was no fan of the #Iran deal and am cautious on this.  As for the $ on the Iran deal, there was an existing IOU.  Not that I liked that part about it, but to allow Iran normalization those payments for oil would have had to be made.

6832 2018-06-12 09:47:31 Yes it should be allowed.  It's been proven to work and cannabis oil has even cured cancer but we're still not allowed to use it.  Many of the prescribed drugs given to people are harmful but that's allowed. Let people make their own choices!

If a 'statehood' is givin imports will be blockaded by Turkey Iran&Syria. ur asking 4 a regional war
6888 2018-06-12 09:36:54 Other question: Why Tunis? Tunisia is less equipped in terms of medical care facilities, funds, NGOs etc. Why refuse to take responsibility in the EU, an economically much stronger region that is largely responsible for the mess in Libya and profits from their oil smuggle?

6891 2018-06-12 09:36:25 Seafood & cod liver oil is indeed good for your health. 

But not because it cures asthma, but because they contain a lot of omega 3 fatty acids that are good for your heart preventing heart attacks.
6892 2018-06-12 09:35:50 There are lots of words there, but not much by way of proof for your claim. Get back to me when you can document  your assertion. Do you even know what "shale oil" is?

6941 2018-06-12 09:26:20 What has happened to this club?? We got harrased by some Chinese sushi selling club, Oil selling club, the club who hasn't won any trophy since 2012 and pretty much every club we've deal with. 

This is all because of Segura and @jmbartomeu. Fuck you both.
6942 2018-06-12 09:26:07 Today someone stupid left oil spilled on the mats at work. Came up from the back legit had to grab my coworkers shirt to keep myself from falling down. Scariest moment I was ready to cry & go home .

6958 2018-06-12 09:23:05 The losing of oil wells thing was definitely tragic and widely detrimental to the growth of the state. But I was under the impression that Tinapa was built to be independent of state FAAC, and was in fact meant to add to, rather than subtract, from state coffers?

6961 2018-06-12 09:22:46 @UBS Inflation data is due from the US in the form of consumer price inflation. This is not the measure favored by the US #Fed, but it is the measure that seems to be favored by financial markets. The higher oil price will be reflected in both the headline and the core measures.
6962 2018-06-12 09:22:44 I was struggling to walk with a seated trolly in January this year. Tearfully in screaming pain unable to stand, sit or walk without agony. Then 6th February I tried CBD oil and within the hour I felt 'normal' the next day I was dancing. I swear Jesus must have used #CBDoil 
6963 2018-06-12 09:22:14 I candidly wish you become @Nigeria President at soonest,y? Cos I believe you will think outside oil & diversify d economy into profitable venture  but something bothered me? Y make that move by advising @NOIweala not to come..pls clear d dust and do it convincingly. Thanks
6964 2018-06-12 09:21:58 Dear sanjeevji
   Generally in peri peri chicken people have added good amount of oil so that while grilling they don't add. They also added fresh red chillies too  but can we use same sauce what we made for paneer for marinating. Reply me soon thanks rims1

6968 2018-06-12 09:20:55 If that’s the case then the medical Cannabis oil should pass customs as it would be CBD- but it’s not as it contains the THC- also in fact it’s the THC that’s active the CBD bind to The cannabinoids receptors in the brain

6972 2018-06-12 09:20:10 Somewhere in a crypt there’s a oil painting of Theresa May that’s getting younger, more intelligent and more humane, as each day passes!
6973 2018-06-12 09:19:43 Yes just been looking, THC is the active part which gets you high, H&B sell it in their UK shops with a 0.5% content so its not illegal, only illegal under certain %'s. There is a non psycho active cannabis & oil which is helping sufferers of various conditions is all I know chap
6974 2018-06-12 09:19:38 Try some CBD oil

6986 2018-06-12 09:18:26 Sad to read this and also that Mathew is leaving. 
Like you I've changed my mind about cannabis. Had I known CBD oil had anything to do with it,  I'd have never tried it. Thankfull i did though for the cronic arthritis flares I was enduring. Painkillers didn't touch... more
6987 2018-06-12 09:18:14 I still wouldn’t give them the money if  i knew it was going to lead to more deaths. Whether it came from Saudi, Yemen, Iran or USA. I don’t like Saudi for their hyper conservatives religious society but the world runs on fossil fuel. Unfortunately Saudi has a lot of oil.

6989 2018-06-12 09:17:49 Why do you continuously spill oil on the tl?
6990 2018-06-12 09:17:48 The THC is just the trippy part. My undestanding is that the CBD is the healer. I know people who use illegal THC oil from plants to treat skin cancer and it works. But watching documentries on the boy in US that stopped 150 fits a day all THC had been removed and it cured.

6996 2018-06-12 09:16:28 My point is: Exercise will influence the endocrine system in a way that, say, oil painting for example, will not. It's not just about any distraction, it has specific physiological benefits. That's not equal to saying lack of exercise is the sole cause of depression.

The G7 is now the G6+1!
Soon, the G6 will move on without us!
They'll sell oil and lumber to China, India instead of us!
7001 2018-06-12 09:15:59 and also people forget that cross river is the ONLY niger delta state that later lost ALL oil revenue to another. Akwa Ibom. Every single well. Overnight
This is why akwa ibom can be building stadiums and churches that cost more Tinapa  today without sweat or comment
7002 2018-06-12 09:15:56 1. Any hints of reversing production cuts and by how much. 2. Current oil demand/supply balance and projection. 3. Change in Venezuelan output. 4. Revisions to demand. 5. Any major revisions to country-specific output.

7017 2018-06-12 09:12:53 2 years, chop chop hurry up. This fairy challenges you to speed it up. I wonder how: You can acquire more palm oil and using less space. Best is to limit the supply of palm oil all together. @GreenpeaceUK Do you see companies take action ??

7030 2018-06-12 09:10:27 To be honest, if we didn’t bomb Libya in the name of democracy (oil) then thousands of people enslaved, humans dying in the sea and people traffickers making millions of pounds of out it, we wouldn’t be in a situation where we’ve exposed Italy to this situation.

7060 2018-06-12 09:04:53 The oil crisis was caused by Venezuela?
I won't deny that the current government is incompetent but that doesn't necessarily tie their incompetence to being socialists
you know 'being socialist' is separate from 'being a competent person', right? they're not linked.
7061 2018-06-12 09:04:40 Yes, and they probably eat in McDonald’s and use single-use plastics, and buy products containing palm oil or eat Californian almonds. But they use non-kill methods for their crops. Great, isn’t it?
7062 2018-06-12 09:04:18 I put some hair oil on and my hair smells nice now. Not that it smells awful usually, but most things I use don't have much of a smell, so this is really noticeable.

7066 2018-06-12 09:03:42 Unfortunately in China the manufacturing energy is subsidized. Dirty coal powers the fab plant. Poor manufacturing quality = higher silicon kerf loss. Dirty diesel to the port. Bunker oil in the container ship = even more particulates. Diesel from port to warehouse, ICE to field.

7075 2018-06-12 09:00:04 not at all, I just think the US has no particular interest in fixing the situation since they are directly benefiting from lower oil prices and rich Venezuelans investing in the US.

A definition that fits JC much better than the modern usage.

7232 2018-06-12 08:25:36 Perhaps London could hand back oil revenue dating from 1970 then Scotland could finance itself.

7239 2018-06-12 08:24:51 80 million barrels of oil are produced per day.

80 million x 1,700 kWh = 136,000,000,000 kWh's of potential energy are produced per day from crude oil  in the world.

How many KWh's of energy are produced by renewables per day in the world?

7255 2018-06-12 08:22:04 In Venezuela's case the solution is the creation of a government in exile which is recognized by the US and Lima group, and given control over Citgo and oil sales.

7273 2018-06-12 08:17:51 Has there been any research on coconut oil's ability to cure staph infections? Infections that would bring fever and wouldn't go away even with heavy antibiotic doses now disappear overnight with coconut oil. Was a miracle medicine for me personally.
7274 2018-06-12 08:17:40 Disappointingly consistent w/all DJT initiatives. All hype, no substance. In this case, weaker than prior docs.
A huge win for Kim, having DJT meet him as an equal when he is the ruthless dictator of a country whose GDP is minuscule.
For DJT, he gets more snake oil to sell.

If we gave US free access to our market, whats to stop them flooding us with cheap grain and wiping out our farms? 

Or oil and cars or a million other things?
7282 2018-06-12 08:15:50 Yes. I've often heard Tories spout that Orkney and Shetland can be free nations as long as they agree with the British colonialists and continue to hand all Oil&Gas to the London treasury. Sad news for them is that the Scottish Islands don't agree with British Nationalism.

2. Mix in your sesame oil and salt. 

Around 70-90 calories and fills you up.

7461 2018-06-12 07:38:48 Water helps but it’s not going to solve EVERYTHING lol i think you should look into exfoliating and buying a spot treatment so you can put on the ones that are really bad. You already use face masks so you’re good on that. Vitamin C oil for scars too! I swear by it
7462 2018-06-12 07:38:44 ok but how do we not have coconut oil anymore
7463 2018-06-12 07:38:36 There is a Doterra essential oil called Past Tense that you rub on the tension spots, like neck shoulders and temples. Works every time for me and has be a life saver.

Thank you Lord God for the following:  Giving us a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, & a garment of praise in place of a spirit of despair. (Isaiah 61:3). Henceforth Nigeria has triumphed over darkness for a new dawn has set in the land.

7624 2018-06-12 07:08:09 The world’s dirtiest oil is in California, followed by Nigeria - we import oil from Nigeria daily. The Alberta oil sands are a naturally occurring oil spill, oil has been seeping out for millennia, industry is in effect cleaning it up. Why not support your own country?

7628 2018-06-12 07:07:18 Yes, let's ignore the second worst nation instead of poking the russian bear that is already cornered financially due to low oil prices. I am glad you aren't secretary of state. Peace doesn't come from surrender like Obama did, or all out conquest like the Bushes.
7629 2018-06-12 07:07:17 We have a problem in Europe: they call it Iran- Nuclear deal. There is still a strong Uranium Lobby. Even if no need for this contaminating heat, goverments use lies for power. Even oil, coal and gas is outdated just to burn it. A big energy lie press people and let them pay.

7644 2018-06-12 07:06:00 Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Ltd looks very expensive when you compare with ONGC and GAIL (3x expensive). It has always been expensive, maybe there's a reason. There is a possibility that it may come down to 30/25 over next few years. FEL - count not quite clear.
7645 2018-06-12 07:05:39 remember it's allowed to cry. so do it if you need, it soothes the body. and if you've got pains somewhere, it's good to take in some natural drops, like hawthorn oil and valerian. I really hope you feel better

7657 2018-06-12 07:04:29 It's a scam. Always been. Olive oil IS very good for you but it's hard to find the good stuff cuz 80% of olive oil on the shelves is pure garbage. Basic stuff to know: Don't buy oil in plastic bottles and/or from big known brands. It has to be extra virgin.

7712 2018-06-12 06:52:23 Whatever it is, 1 thing is certain: it will enrich Trump’s family. He won’t agree to anything that doesn’t pay . So he’ll trade US secrets for cash (see: Kushner), or help Putin w/ oil deals (see: Rosneft). IMO this ends with a deal similar to Iran agreement (see: Nobel dream).

7769 2018-06-12 06:42:20 Yes, coming up here with his il-informed ego to rant against oil production not only puts a lot of food on Canadian plates but produces a substance, that until we come up with something to replace it, is even used by you! Another hypocrite stands up.

7826 2018-06-12 06:29:45 There is a lot of shale coal, of the type paraffin oil can be extracted from (allowing for domestic refining of JP1). In the early 1900’s there was approximately USD20m in gold being extracted near Pyongyang also, and other valuable minerals.
7827 2018-06-12 06:29:07 I've got an idea, why don't we build a carriage, give it an engine powered by refined oil we can get out of the ground or under the sea, feed it to the engine and get it to explode to turn the wheels? Think of how rich we'll get before we destroy the planet and kill millions.
7828 2018-06-12 06:28:53 I am a candidate for low  THC oil in Georgia but they don't have any dispensaries in the state. They legalized it but they really don't want you to have it.

7951 2018-06-12 06:00:24 The cherry point refinery is expanding its production by 9,000 barrels! That's 1073.164239 liters of oil!!!!! #stopcrudeoil #screwpollution

7955 2018-06-12 05:59:22 That Grey Clay? going south u start seeing in the Cliffs beside the Awatere River, anyway once it is 1st exposed 2 wet weather it swells up then slips down , they use Bentonite when they drill an oil  well & want to plug the hole it swells, so they can come back later .

7968 2018-06-12 05:56:46 The word is oil not grease , black people always find a way to switch shit
7969 2018-06-12 05:56:15 Looks great, I'd recommend getting a little bit of sesame oil into the mix too
7970 2018-06-12 05:56:02 Just for asking, if Kenya has been importing crued oil and refine it what will prevent Lokichar oil from turn back to kenyan port from deepseas for processing here. What will be the difference? Just thinking loud!
7971 2018-06-12 05:55:54 Same here with a slight variation. Never saw a day of want in my life, and knew I was lucky, but appreciated everything I had. My grandmother worked as a stenographer for oil companies in Caracas and made a pretty good living doing it. I was privileged, but not spoiled.

7980 2018-06-12 05:54:46 Why would they want the EU disunited? Surely, it would be easier to deal with the commission on oil, gas and other exports to EU? The USA prefer it that way. Hence Obama came over here and directly interfered in the referendum.
7981 2018-06-12 05:54:41 The ability to rewrite history through a prism of your own making. The Gulf Wars were concocted by oil companies desperate to control their stock flow
7982 2018-06-12 05:54:40 And, my real reason for going back to 2016: just one year into the administration, and we were already getting so much revenue from tax; why did we have to start borrowing so much?

Mind you, it's not like oil revenue stopped coming in?
How much is our annual budget?

8031 2018-06-12 05:41:57 The things to be prepared before ‘MUDIK’ with a car:

2. Car
Check the tires, the oil, brake pads are necessary if you take a long road with a car. So, double check everything crucial

8034 2018-06-12 05:41:41 first you brown some pine nuts and capers on medium heat with some olive oil and mix them with your preferred pasta (mine is angel hair!) and add some diced kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, and red wine vinegar! it’s super good

8038 2018-06-12 05:41:10 I hope you don't have to wait 1.5 weeks to get a massage, but keep in mind, the absence of Club Finn is not keeping me and others from bringing our massage oil.

8040 2018-06-12 05:40:17 Here, I was replying @sule_1k who said Nigeria solely relies on oil. You've just helped to buttress my point that Nigeria doesn't need oil to meet her financial obligations. Thanks.

8055 2018-06-12 05:37:43 FYI, for anyone like me who spent 2 hours pulling apart your car trying to find why it's burning oil:
Apparently wiper fluid is waaaaay fucking flammable and produces a bunch of smoke when burned.  Also apparently my wiper fluid hose was spraying directly onto my engine. Go me.
8056 2018-06-12 05:37:01 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
8057 2018-06-12 05:36:57 the really nice thing about quinoa is you can put anything in it (sauce, seasoning, toppings) just like you could with rice, but quinoa actually has like 15 grams of protein. it’s really good with some sort of like chili garlic sauce or some sort of like spiced oil
8058 2018-06-12 05:36:42 op Questions about #hempworx #cbdoil 1. Is Hempworx Cbd Marijuana ?

No, although cannabid oil comes from  the same plant and Hempwox is full spectrum(meaning we use the whole plant) it is not marijuana you will not get high , you will get healthy .
8059 2018-06-12 05:36:40 Mostly ramai yang bagi bad review about that biore Cleansing Oil. But luckily for me, I love it! As long as you do properly cleansing, I rasa it will be fine! Tips : use lukewarm water and cleansing cloth when you cleanse!

8064 2018-06-12 05:36:03 Trump is a showman and the best snake oil salesman in history. This is all photo op for him. Just wait, next week he will tweet and throw Kim Jong Un under the bus! He hasn't dome anything but make promises. Still waiting on this wall that will never be built!
8065 2018-06-12 05:36:01 I ended up using baby oil but thank you 
8066 2018-06-12 05:36:01 just listened to your podcast on sleep. another way to help with falling asleep is the use of lavender essential oil in a diffiuser. ...along with a white noise machine or quiet sleeping music.

8075 2018-06-12 05:34:09 Well Ian. If it doesn't work out, our federal gov't could always buy up all the old recording studios in Canada and get into the music business, just like they've done with the oil industry.
8076 2018-06-12 05:34:09 Crude Oil Prices Look Past Trump/Kim Summit, OPEC in Focus
Crude oil prices are unlikely to find lasting direction in the outcome of a meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un as markets focus on OPEC supply trend...

8078 2018-06-12 05:33:54 She attends too much time cuddling up to her assault rifles, intoxicated by the smell of gun oil. The only movies she watches are ones with Charlton Heston in then.

8080 2018-06-12 05:33:19 I’m not a distributor but @NaturesUltra has great CBD oil. It’s helping reduce my anxiety and I’ve been sleeping better
8081 2018-06-12 05:33:17 Any candidate who shows me how he/she will reduce the overall cost of governance, define a unified vision for the country’s 250ish ethnics/rally all sectoral plans (around that vision) and show how Nigeria’s dependence on oil can be reduced (per annum) via other income sources
8082 2018-06-12 05:33:16 Coo.. Same. I wash w/ black soap. Then i apply witch hazel. I moisturize w/ olive oil at night. Olive oil helps break down my natural skin oils. Biweekly i use a bentonite clay or strawberry lemon mask. I exfoliate w/ shea butter and raw sugar.
8083 2018-06-12 05:32:59 maybelline total temptation mascara!!! has coconut oil in it and its only $8

8087 2018-06-12 05:32:10 You are not getting it. I am looking at it from an investor's perspective. Its a poor decision too, as ONGC is down 10-15% since its peak in February. It should have shot up because of rising oil prices. This is an unnecessary erosion of the nation's wealth.
8088 2018-06-12 05:31:46 Some more nadai fragrance, so worth it to try! Ya bisi trial kits, 100+, for 3 items. Ulih try nya dulu. Mmg worth ur money esp the cleansing oil & AHA BHA cleanser.
8089 2018-06-12 05:31:44 Maybe if your ancestors weren’t so damn greedy, we would be in Africa as well. But they couldn’t keep their grubby hands away from our oil, our gold, and all our resources.
8090 2018-06-12 05:31:41 So now you paid to train thousands of oil workers to do what? There has to be project investment simultaneous. Training alone is not a solution.
8091 2018-06-12 05:31:35 North Korea has no oil like Iraq or Libya for the West to 'care and help' the North Korean people. North Korea is only worth helping if there is free oil to steal from.

8098 2018-06-12 05:30:07 Unrelated, but I just had to tell you I had a dream last night that was basically that baby oil gif you posted of Balor, except it was fuckin Jonathan Tucker. IHU >_<

8110 2018-06-12 05:27:29 Except that another group of them will be protesting and trying to block hauling oil by train. They’re always opposing something and they have an army of lawyers funded by uberwealthy Dem/progressive donors.
8111 2018-06-12 05:27:22 Neither science, nor this article, say that oil and gas are les of a strain on the environment than renewables.

8114 2018-06-12 05:26:35 The #NEB is mostly made up of member that support pipelines and big oil. That happened during the harper years, and they do not care about consultation with FN or the people of Canada. Northern gateway was never going to be passed anyway. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #StopKXL
8115 2018-06-12 05:26:22 So if, as Rai would have the ignoramus' believe, lakhs of crores were stolen, just imagine how well the economy was doing that the nation was better off despite the huge chori. And remember, the oil prices, despite almost doubling in 18 months, have still not reached UPA levels.
8116 2018-06-12 05:26:19 Thomas Edison - 1931, not long before he died, told his friends Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone: “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that…

8123 2018-06-12 05:24:51 Yes. The same logic that protest building a pipeline & would rather haul oil on unit trains thru cities.

8135 2018-06-12 05:21:58 So, Nikki - you don't like it when they DON'T review things thoroughly enough, according to your priorities and world view (think oil and gas exploration) and you don't like it when they DO review things thoroughly. A little consistency wouldn't go amiss...
8136 2018-06-12 05:21:51 I didn't know there was a right side! Go figure!!
8137 2018-06-12 05:21:51 Gas pries go up every summer - kids are out of school and families travel. Google it. Also, new and additional oil refineries to increase gasoline  production have not been built in decades.

Tea tree oil helps reduce inflammation, witch hazel heals breakouts and face cream provides moisture.

8152 2018-06-12 05:19:13 Canada is the biggest supplier of oil to US. Trump slaps tariffs on Canada to make Trudeau put tariff on oil. Putin's biggest export is oil. Putin gains market share. Putin wins.
8153 2018-06-12 05:18:47 i need a proper deep fryer so i can store the oil left over..
8154 2018-06-12 05:18:35 I season mine after most uses by adding oil and then sitting it outside in the hot sun. You can also bake it at 300 degrees

8157 2018-06-12 05:18:18 I love tea tree oil and also use that Trader Joes face wash!! I used to use St. Ives before I went cruelty free and learned that they test on innocent little bunnies. You should try facial scrubs from The Body Shop, Alba Botanica, Shea Moisture or Derma E. Just a thought. 
8158 2018-06-12 05:18:09 Growth oil the lul white and green bottle
8159 2018-06-12 05:18:04 If religion becomes stronger than economy it will have negative backlash thats what is happening in Pakistan. That's why nature has distributed resources unevenly for example oil so that one country one religion doesn't become a monopoly. That's why Atul is in UAE.

8164 2018-06-12 05:17:36 Another easy way to help them out is to try not to touch your face too much - that just adds more oil.
8165 2018-06-12 05:16:52 Please don’t act like you sell us oil at a discount out of kindness.  The oil produced in Alberta is heavy and requires additional processing.  It is sold at a discount to everyone.

8170 2018-06-12 05:16:27 I feel like if u care for ur nails n do soak offs and hydrate directly w ur preferred oil between sets, its even less damaging than getting gel done
8171 2018-06-12 05:16:16 Imagine the match up there. Rodman out of retirement, LeBron moving to Kansas. Oil, old audacious. #nba #2019
8172 2018-06-12 05:16:15 You either don't understand the first goddam thing about insurance, Stedman, which seems unlikely, or you're selling socialist snake oil, like your ex-boss. Either way, do us all a favor and STFU. I'm sure Brian Terry's family would appreciate your silence.
8173 2018-06-12 05:16:07 Did you know... a sinus infection can be cured quickly and easily by steaming with organic oils; such as oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree, mint and many more!

With God on your side, no problem is unsolvable!

8179 2018-06-12 05:15:12 Hi citizens, our new “winning” dictator is in bed with anyone who is a dictator, he has made sure we do not progress. Oil companies, insurances companies and lobbyist will still be in power in 2019. We have been governed by political corruption and corporate greed for 40 years.
8180 2018-06-12 05:15:01 Why would the gov prosecute them? The  truth is not something the UK gov wants out: How the US & UK have funded & trained ISIS and put them in Syria to try to remove the legitimate Syrian government,in order to put an oil pipeline through Syria.

UK needs tougher corruption laws.

8190 2018-06-12 05:12:44 Cast iron is perfect for you. Wait til it cools, wipe w/ paper towel. add a little bit of oil ( I used olive oil) spread it around w/ paper towel and you’re done. If desired, take mild soap & sift sponge and wash quickly. Soap, salt, chain mail ( ???) will take off curing.
8191 2018-06-12 05:12:06 Nah I’m out. I’m a Accountant for a Oil and Gas Company. You out?
8192 2018-06-12 05:11:54 you need an oil diffuser

8194 2018-06-12 05:11:31 High key would rather watch my colorchanging essential oil diffuser for hours than go to a club
8195 2018-06-12 05:11:25 My poor hair absorbed the oil so fast and it wasn’t even oily from the deep oil treatment like it usually is #DayOneofRecovery
8196 2018-06-12 05:11:18 Try lavender oil in your feet! Melatonin can eventually dull your sleep senses so it'll almost feel like it's stopped working. That was my experience, at least.
8197 2018-06-12 05:11:08 Put some lavender Essential Oil on your middle toes mate  it will help a mil
8198 2018-06-12 05:10:55 Ask them to go easy on the sauce/olive oil and you are good to go. Had the Classic Italian yesterday, nice.

8202 2018-06-12 05:10:32 I taught your government was responsible for 9/11 then the audacity to blame others just to cause unnecessary war as distraction from drilling oil
8203 2018-06-12 05:10:20 I've seen sesame seeds. I don't really know how you're getting oil out of those little guys (ESPECIALLY toasted).
8204 2018-06-12 05:10:18 Y’all I’m so blessed Colby took my car and got the oil changed and filled it up and even washed it  I’m spoiled rotten

8209 2018-06-12 05:09:25 Nancy Pelosi multiplied her wealth by a factor of 10 during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. George Soros more than doubled his wealth in Obama's first term, primarily off Petrobras after Obama send aid to develop their oil industry while shutting ours down.

8211 2018-06-12 05:08:13 It's for keeping oil lamps in villages when you don't have electricity. This is quite common in villages in India. There will be similar ones inside of the house as well.
8212 2018-06-12 05:08:02 Even the major oil companies admit we need to find alternatives to fossil fuels. Only idiots who buy in Caesar Trump's demagoguery as he throws bread to the masses deny this

8218 2018-06-12 05:06:21 Trans Mountain & Eastern Gateway...Sheer needs to change the conversation to Oil and point out the bigger picture...99% goes to USA and we buy about 70% from them on imports. Exports are $20-25 below market price...import full price we are losing $189M daily w/out pipelines

 Today #Crude #Oil Scenario added.
8220 2018-06-12 05:05:33 If you are prepared to rely on Saudi, Russian and other foreign oil sources, I suppose existing sources might get us there - not sure. But remember the OPEC moves in the 70s. If we are dependent on them, anything can happen.
8221 2018-06-12 05:04:37 True but my skin stays cracked what is coconut oil?¿?¿ will say that afternoon breeze is worth worshipping
8222 2018-06-12 05:03:28 Sure thats sweat and not baby oil??
8223 2018-06-12 05:03:18 ur skin will so soft and moisturized if u use baby oil on wet skin after the shower (exfoliate 1st tho) trust
8224 2018-06-12 05:02:38 hell no, if i could get cheap reliable energy and life off grid i'd do it in a heart beat, its just not practical as of now, i dislike all big corps, incl but not limited to, banks insurance co, gov, retail, big oil, big pharmacy, phone, cable, police, education etc...
8225 2018-06-12 05:02:28 No, it's autocracy and an economy too reliant on oil. Many European countries have more socialistic systems than Venezuela ever did, and this isn't happening there. And there are no signs of it happening.
8226 2018-06-12 05:02:09 Aok klairs ng bagus. Tpi mahal syi. cleasing oil klairs RM93.Ya beli on9. Mun beli locally dictok mahal gk. Innisfree ada yg green tea pun. Dkt hermo RM65.

8228 2018-06-12 05:01:52 Not sure Weinstein’s getting a free pass. But it’s a good point. There is already a rape epidemic in oil and gas, but the liberal media hasn’t scooped it yet. Will the conservative media?
8229 2018-06-12 05:01:23 What Obama did start was lower unemployment, economic recovery and investment in renewable energy. “Millions” did not get jobs in coal and oil, but billons went to the stockholders and ceos.
8230 2018-06-12 05:01:21 Oil Incentives are more than 6% of the worlds GDP
Millions every year die prematurely from vehicle exhaust 
Oil has caused wars costing the US over $13 Trillion 
Along with millions of lives^^^
Pipelines built illegally on Native American Territory are already leaking.
8231 2018-06-12 05:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet much else.

8235 2018-06-12 04:59:47 Gas prices decreasing was not a good thing. The middle eastern oil Barron’s were flooding the market with cheap oil to try and hurt our economy, do some research on this you will be very surprised
8236 2018-06-12 04:59:41 took a coconut oil bubble bath, lit some candles and now watching the office  my night.

8251 2018-06-12 04:56:02 Actually yes. A big win for corrupt oil and coal companies. Also a win for certain countries who want America to fail.

8264 2018-06-12 04:54:09 Got an audience giggle in @agentGav’s talk on now when he spoke about #data NOT being the new oil, but rather being #infrastructure.

8270 2018-06-12 04:53:02 Amen brother, single most important investment we make. Oil doesn't start new companies and create new jobs in new markets.

8272 2018-06-12 04:52:37 this tea tree oil really workin’ hard on my skin omg
8273 2018-06-12 04:52:13 99% of science community presents valid science for climate change. Melting polar ice caps is most obvious, then rising sea levels. Only the oil industry paid scientists and gullible fools dispute this. Which are you two?
8274 2018-06-12 04:51:00 We can't afford research, we just stand back and watch our money go to gas & oil companies who know want to tear up the country for more oil.  We give them more & more and they dump on us more & more.

Woke up. Went to the gym. Got my cars oil change done. Activated our six flag passes. Organized the garage. Picked up the Harley. Now bed
8284 2018-06-12 04:50:17 Will you consider revamping oil to use the same pipes as the water system
Keep the current system and mod all the droopers /  burners with a pipe fitting that when used turns the dropper off (lag reduction)

8294 2018-06-12 04:49:12 Very true indeed! However, latest policy amendments may position Kenya as a (very) decent oil exporter in the coming years. Hopefully, this will pave the way for major development for the country and it's citizens!
8295 2018-06-12 04:49:02 alot uh alot uh drinks and we don't want it go to waste
pretty colours in the air but I got oil all on my face
8296 2018-06-12 04:48:47 Imagine the liberal reactions we’d see in the media if there was a rape epidemic in the senior levels of the oil or coal industry. 

There would be calls to shut it all down. 

So why does Hollywood get a free pass?

8306 2018-06-12 04:45:37 In bed with Big Oil... This is no shock.

8311 2018-06-12 04:44:48 Bitches be getting so excited about their new cars but don’t even know when they need their oil changed
8312 2018-06-12 04:44:29 Ok. So we just keep digging up oil and burning it?  When we could use the 3.3 bill in oil subsidies +the 4.5 billion for an old leaky pipeline + 7-12 bill from the new one to transition AWAY from fossil fuels? Do Canadians have NO concept of generational justice? Screw the kids!
8313 2018-06-12 04:44:09 Only Muricans read the news. Singapore is a poor and backward country who don't know anything. If only they had oil, US could help them too.
8314 2018-06-12 04:44:08 I wish you lived closer!! I'd pour some in a sample and let you try it! Oh if your skin is sensitive I would mix the oil with coconut oil (like whatever you might normally use) just so it isn't too harsh on your skin

8317 2018-06-12 04:43:57 The Trump tweet a few weeks ago clearly asked OPEC for more oil. Thanks God for the internet. There is no denying possible.
8318 2018-06-12 04:43:50 Whoever said coconut oil is not good for your skin does not want to see you succeed
8319 2018-06-12 04:43:36 I forgot “shades” and not all my tweets make sense to everyone.

8330 2018-06-12 04:41:15 Affrin ji still the opposition ptotets are continuing throughout India I think petroleum ministry should implement the proposed solution for oil prices reduction quickly and nullify the advantage of the opposition parties and bring smiles on common mans face
8331 2018-06-12 04:40:48 A total waste of time. Cornyn and his cronies are only interested in helping themselves & each other. Ask about taxscam and a provision for gas/oil to help him,  Cruz etc. Repubs have robbed us and our children and are bent on destroying middle America. We will die in ER waiting.
8332 2018-06-12 04:40:44 I went to Chic Fil A. Never once did anyone there bring up God, homosexuality, or anything biblical. I just ate a sandwich and fries baked in peanut oil (praise the Lord) Service was great. Employees were happy. We all were. Know them by their fruits.

8337 2018-06-12 04:39:56 However, the Trump tweet  a few weeks ago clearly asked OPEC for more oil.
8338 2018-06-12 04:39:56 What did we receive from NK when past Presidents NEVER met with him or his father? We gave them lighter sanctions and heating oil and received promises that they'd stop developing nukes. And how did that work out for us and the rest of Asia? NK took what we gave and laughed at us

8356 2018-06-12 04:37:10 If Argentina built an economy that was over reliant on British capital, well, I can hardly blame the British for that decision.

8452 2018-06-12 04:19:50 Fair, but a case can be made the economic turnaround started in 2010 when Republicans took over the house and The booming oil industry played a big part, an industry Obama was vehemently against. So to give Obama or Trump all the credit is probably inaccurate
8453 2018-06-12 04:19:47 Little does he know in NK that means “check your oil”
8454 2018-06-12 04:19:39 Is that after Trudeu runs a couple more oil pipelines?
8455 2018-06-12 04:19:39 That coconut oil made my hair hella soft

8464 2018-06-12 04:17:26 I've been changing my oil my whole life lol. This isn't something new.
8465 2018-06-12 04:17:25 Peppermint oil will take the sting away. Acv will take the redness away
8466 2018-06-12 04:17:21 Congressman commits to diversity by mixing Fruits and Mustard oil
8467 2018-06-12 04:17:06 And the US keeps falling behind because our government is owned by big gas & oil.  Never mind it is not a smart thing to do, gas & oil companies want more, then more. Then more it will never be enough to satisfy that level of greed.
8468 2018-06-12 04:16:23 Haha of course. It's not too hard to change oil and a filter 
8469 2018-06-12 04:16:19 Nothing is backed by nothing. The usd is made from nothing, agreed, but supported and regulated by oil supply and demand
8470 2018-06-12 04:16:10 I can use a full body massage... with oil

8472 2018-06-12 04:15:33 Yeah, he walks into a den of lions & comes out a winner, walks on water, takes one slice of bread and tiny fish and feeds 300 million people, turns water into wine and sells snake oil and his deplorables gobble it all up.
8473 2018-06-12 04:15:31 Wasn’t it Trudeau that said we need to phase out the auto sector?  Or was it the oil sands?  For the life of me, I don’t see the difference.
8474 2018-06-12 04:15:21 Seraphine Botanicals is 100% vegan and cruelty free. I use their silk and argan oil infused mascara and I like it!! I've also heard good things about Pacifica's Stellar Gaze mascara and it's next on my wishlist to try.
8475 2018-06-12 04:15:03 doesn't it take a lot of money/energy to pull oil out of sand? IE, not really worth it...
8476 2018-06-12 04:14:49 If you have any, rub some lavender or eucalyptus oil on your temples.
8477 2018-06-12 04:14:47 All I want is someone to oil my scalp when it gets itchy. Is that too much to ask?
8478 2018-06-12 04:14:45 I'm beginning to think melanin is a type of oil or make up.

8481 2018-06-12 04:14:00 Anything with tea tree oil helps a lot too! I use St. Ives apricot scrub and then the Trader Joe’s tea tree oil face wash. Really anything with tea tree oil will help though.
8482 2018-06-12 04:13:55 Spider or tick? I'm so tense about that this season I'm stocking up on food-grade diatomaceous earth, cedar oil, and all the anti-tick (and mosquito) plants I can. I'd drape my yard in mint, if I didn't want only mint to exist there.

8493 2018-06-12 04:11:36 Indeed we must condemn violence, with more countries destroyed and people displaced then World War 2, all under Shariah Law..

Oh no wait it's in the name of Democracy, or was it Oil and Opium? It's all so confusing, damn it! 
8494 2018-06-12 04:11:36 Biggest demand for oil is driven by weapons of war, not peace.
8495 2018-06-12 04:11:31 There are indications that Nigeria’s oil exports are expected to fall in July to just 1.43 million barrels per day (bpd), loading plans showed, the lowest level so far this year.

8510 2018-06-12 04:09:12 This is why Trump does not like world trade, he's envious that other countries do what the U. S. just plans. Instead he prposes more oil and coal.
8511 2018-06-12 04:09:06 The denuclearization process should fall on both states. Anyway can argue that NK only prepared nuclear bombs as form of defence.

Where's the US is one state that plays the 'police of the world' bombing countries it will benefit in. Eg: Middle East = Oil

8518 2018-06-12 04:08:04 read the epic of Gilgamesh, a part within he is regaled with the tale of the flood and the boat built, it literally lists combustible engine components, and damn it all vegetable oil as a fuel source, why are we all so naive, to believe anything is new? Keep reaching
8519 2018-06-12 04:07:57 America will never be better then after 8 years with Trump. He is the anointed one. Barack Obama's policies are being undone more and more each day so that the economy can move. The USA will be the largest oil producer in the world by year end. Obama tried to stop that.

8527 2018-06-12 04:06:06 we need a system of transcontinental piping that carries the overflow through a filtration center & out to drought areas. if we can do it to carry oil that kills everything, we can do it to move h2o away from flood areas. we can pay for it w/the $ we save on flood & crop damage

8538 2018-06-12 04:04:17 Not sure why Repubs who want to be energy independent are keeping us dependent on foreign oil.

8541 2018-06-12 04:03:51 The oil probably shouldn't be extracted anyways.  Oil is an outmoded form of energy.

8543 2018-06-12 04:03:30 This reply of yours is epic,,,,, I mean you are simpally outstanding,,,  you are 100% right they basically are nothing but jealous, as they can't travel anywhere without transport and is it important to mention where such oil comes which is used on transport etc

8551 2018-06-12 04:02:30 Do you realize that our "allies" are friendly with Russia..

8573 2018-06-12 03:58:14 How’s that going? Do you feel better? Maybe I’ll give it a go. We’ve been doing apple cider vinegar and also flax seed oil and are digging it.
8574 2018-06-12 03:57:59 I think having to refill oil diffusers with water after each use was such a flaw in the design. Like damn I wanna relax but walking to the sink sounds too stressful to execute, tbh
8575 2018-06-12 03:57:46 He's a massive caver to big oil, despite pretenses to caring about the environment. Nobody is perfect. Still, everyone looks good next to Donald.

8577 2018-06-12 03:57:12 July crude oil closed lower on Monday. The high-range close sets the stage for a steady to higher opening when Tuesday's night session begins. Stochastics and the RSI are oversold but are turning neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near-term.
8578 2018-06-12 03:56:45 my bad, but yeah, a diy is just brown sugar and organic honey. Then I use an oil afterwards. Sometimes I mix an oil in, it helps soften the skin. But just check for allergens as far as store bought ones.
8579 2018-06-12 03:56:13 That's awesome... I recently retired from an oil refinery and I worked with so many truly great individuals. They became like my own family. While I don't miss the mundaneness of work, I do miss my colleagues.

8594 2018-06-12 03:53:59 Lmao so I literally don’t even put anything on my skin because it’s entirely too sensitive. The most I’ll put on it is aquaphor or coconut oil if it’s too dry for me. Lol
8595 2018-06-12 03:53:42 You got a 10 step k-beauty regimen? I’m so lazy I just oil cleanse, exfoliate sometimes, and pray. Dab on some SPF and go
8596 2018-06-12 03:53:41 Inflation in Oil prices is Eid Gift for an innocent Nation.
8597 2018-06-12 03:53:24 I would have never guessed that but it's cool. let me know what you think about the show.  I worked in oil field so I'm used of foul language and dirty minds. From what you just told me being open minded I would suggest to you the tv series shameless the American version.
8598 2018-06-12 03:53:18 My mom gave me an essential oil diffuser when the same thing happened. I love moms
8599 2018-06-12 03:52:58 no oil better than the all healing tea tree oil so don’t even @ me.
8600 2018-06-12 03:52:37 Use baking soda and water!  Baking soda is a cleaning agent, which has always helped me with my cast iron!  Every few uses you should re-season the pan will some oil!
8601 2018-06-12 03:52:35 just finished reading Under The Tuscan Sun (30 years late) and just told Eric that I need to go to Italy. And buy a farmhouse. And start an olive oil business. And move there.
8602 2018-06-12 03:52:32 Ummm well I think I need new wipers, and then some of that spray stuff that cleans the windshield and I have NO clue when I need an oil change  bc when I bought the car there was no sticker thingy to tell me! Man idk a damn thing about cars.

8605 2018-06-12 03:51:58 She takes glucosamine, fish oil, gabapentin and vet profuen for the pain and such. We also have tramadol for her. The bladder issues have just recently started.
8606 2018-06-12 03:51:46 Nah been had oil money for almost 10 years
8607 2018-06-12 03:51:44 i'm gettin' real into ghosts nowadays. Whether it's Death Stranding's otherworldly oil poltergeists, or just your run-of-the-mill spirit familiar, its ghost time.

8609 2018-06-12 03:51:26 Lavender essential oil really helps come the nervous system and will help you fall asleep
8610 2018-06-12 03:51:14 Try peppermint oil, that might make it leave.
8611 2018-06-12 03:51:08 got some sweet almond oil today. we’ll see how this goes.

8614 2018-06-12 03:50:45 Susang this discussion is closed. Bobo is off to bed and I'm about to do the same. Thanks for chiming in with nothing though, that's how our whole back and forth got started (ironic chuckle) I just did this exact thing not interested in going another round sorry.
8615 2018-06-12 03:50:41 No one should be shocked that the WALL ST Journal is towing the high profit oil industry line. All they care about is money.
8616 2018-06-12 03:50:33 わー。雷やべえー。頭上でミシミシバリバリいったぁー。さすがに怖いわー。
8617 2018-06-12 03:49:58 Essential oils are good but you're right. It's not a replacement for medication. I use peppermint & lemongrass during the day & lavender & cedarwood at night. Both times I add 2 drops of tea tree oil.
I also take migraine medication.
8618 2018-06-12 03:49:25 It's like sitting down on the same level with the leaders of Iran, but if they had no oil.
8619 2018-06-12 03:49:14 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
8620 2018-06-12 03:48:46 Me too muka jadi pedih bila guna nutox oil cleanser. Then i pergi guardian, staff sana suggest i pakai safi punya cleansing oil. Tak famous but those yg dah pernah guna mmg tak cari yg lain dah. Plus murah compare to oil cleanser lain. Uguys can give it a try 
8621 2018-06-12 03:48:34 #russia pumped 11.09 mln bpd #oil in first week of June, already above its limit of 10.95 mln bpd! #opecmeetingvienna #shale #SaudiArabia #iran #venezuela #oott $wti $bno
8622 2018-06-12 03:48:29 Had a menace on our street who kept taunting and taking my neighbor to court - one Day was so tired of hearing her complain about him - went over pour Holy oil around his property and asked God to lift him out of this neighborhood 6 months ago he sold his home - and moved away
8623 2018-06-12 03:48:03 I love the smell of my car. It smells like tanning oil and bubble gum  
8624 2018-06-12 03:47:45 Perhaps the Mexican Army should weigh in. Mexico has mutual defense treaties with the OAS, some of which are also part of OPEC.

I'm not suggesting a fight or a war (of course), but there's some bargaining power to be had there. I remember the oil embargo; it sucked.
8625 2018-06-12 03:47:34 You distrust but served? May I ask why? I have to kinda agree though
 You give old white men a inch and they take a mile kinda thing. Corrupt. Line their pockets. Send our family's to war over oil. I see that. But you served for them. Do you have a different view now?
8626 2018-06-12 03:47:12  damn u even tried avocado oil
8627 2018-06-12 03:46:44 There’s a website called Monq that sells essential oil pens

8632 2018-06-12 03:46:10 Didn't think to take a picture, but dinner tonight was meat stripped from a leftover half rack of ribs, sauteed with kimchi in a mixture of olive oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and mirin, served over rice with a shot of sake on the side.

8636 2018-06-12 03:45:43 Just thinking aloud @ianbremmer but does Little Rocket Man even show up without prompting from Russia (which sent oil to NK)? And wouldn't bolstering Trump's bonafides give him more domestic support for a phony trade war that would benefit ...who? Perhaps those who want NATO dead
8637 2018-06-12 03:45:26 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8638 2018-06-12 03:45:24 Tea tree oil is my life saver

8640 2018-06-12 03:45:17 My nights entertainment is trying to kill a mosquito in the dim light of a coil oil lamp. What a storm.
8641 2018-06-12 03:45:04 I burned part of my hand fooling with some french fries. That same day I poured the hot oil down the drain and it sounded like a giant monster or demon was being burned alive. Lol 18 year old me was a bit dumb when it came to cooking.

8643 2018-06-12 03:44:56 I think it’s incredible that anyone can “read” the oil patterns on the lanes- they all look the same to me, and I always play poorly. I have fun, just don’t score well. I clearly don’t play enough.

8649 2018-06-12 03:44:09 Chicken thighs? You mean chicken breasts. Thighs contain too much dietary fat. Oh, cooked with spray oil that they tracked and butter spray on the broccoli. Bits of eraser with wet puzzle pieces.
8650 2018-06-12 03:44:00 Yes I know. But registered Dems & Independents outnumber GOP in LA1. Not going to be a cake walk. But we’re seeing a lot of moms concerned about healthcare & kids’ safety in school. And Scalise’s silence on DJT’s tariffs which hurt oil/gas/port is frustrating! #FutureIsFemale

8654 2018-06-12 03:43:18 I don’t fuck with sunscreen just bc I’ve read a few articles that have actually linked it to skin cancer. So I just use coconut oil and olive oil. It’s only like a fucking spf 8 but it’s better than nothing lol. They have natural ones in the store but I’m just lazy

8662 2018-06-12 03:42:20 So the next time when the prospect of a nuclear war looms between these two countries and the oil barrel price shoots up maybe Mr Shukla and co will quietly pay up the extra rupees when they fill their tanks.

8669 2018-06-12 03:41:45 Before moving back into farming, I was an industrial engineer for years. The efficiency at most elevators is a joke, as is the rail system. Buyers love to blame trains, oil, and farmers for their own lack of efficiency. The local elevator is a money pit.
8670 2018-06-12 03:41:29 He's wrong. It's NOT olive oil! It's spaghetti sauce.

8675 2018-06-12 03:40:39 Aiken tea tree oil or tretinoin cream. Tapi tretinoin kena careful and not for beginners skincare
8676 2018-06-12 03:40:27 I remember watching news footage of the Queen in Saudi Arabia, and other dignitaries and leaders visiting that country. This was in the '70s and everyone was wondering, exactly what the frig were they all going down there for?

I think they were all bought off with oil money.
8677 2018-06-12 03:40:19 You can always tell when shit in this house is getting dire when I come home with an essential oil & insist on spritzing it everywhere

8680 2018-06-12 03:40:10 It's because Texas and Louisiana oil has less regulations than Canada and is easier to refine and Texas and Louisiana have tons of refineries.....so yes Trudeau could do something ,but America has the better product as far price.
8681 2018-06-12 03:39:52 haha

8687 2018-06-12 03:38:59 Rupee was near Rs. 70 when crude oil was $105, now it is between Rs. 63-67. Stronger rupee decreased the oil import bill. That has helped more to the govt., more reason to decrease prices.
8688 2018-06-12 03:38:57 Who ever put tea tree and peppermint oil in the steam room GAWD BLESS YOU! Cleanse my pores and open up my sinuses

8719 2018-06-12 03:34:37 Thanks. I am sorry to hear that it took 3 hours for the mechanics to change the oil and tail light. It should not have taken that long.

Reduce the use of groundnut oil in your cooking, you will appreciate the quality of health in your family.
8724 2018-06-12 03:34:21 No, nor will I use it. That nonsense has been on the market for like 20+ years and has never been tested by the FDA. Total snake oil. I have an orange at home. That'll do.

8730 2018-06-12 03:33:26 I love the Italian phrase “la Bella figura”- it’s something completely lost on the Misshapen and Ivy Leaguers. I used to watch Scottish oil workers get into scraps with locals in Baku bars. They were never allowed to be tossed as it would result in the loss of face.
8731 2018-06-12 03:32:42 Coconut oil masks!
8732 2018-06-12 03:32:39 I put Jamaican black castor oil under my closure once a week while I had a sew in and my hair grew an inch. I had the sew in for a month.

The oil that collects on unrefrigerated cheddar can be applied as sunscreen.

8889 2018-06-12 03:07:48 Oh yeah, terrible Monday morning. 

If I wasn't at home feeling like a rickety tin man in need of oil, I would've still taken a sick day for mental health purposes.
8890 2018-06-12 03:07:32 Just like water and oil, bullshit and I don't mix
8891 2018-06-12 03:07:27 Just keep it away from the hot oil. Oil splatters burn.

8897 2018-06-12 03:06:33 Lillian Gish on trial is one of my favorite silent film performances, and there are some strikingly composed Sjöström sequences. but MGM and The Scarlet Letter is an oil and water combination.
8898 2018-06-12 03:06:21 Review ,this majority govt just does gimmicks only , you want oil from water well , read constitutional rights of Union territory , trying to make fool of ppl .

8901 2018-06-12 03:06:07 Sir, India paid just part of its dues $6 billion to Iran in 2016..Name a country in the world who would prefer to sign MOUs for getting it's Strategic Oil reserves to be filled like India on Debt as dollar fluctuates.Debt servicing eroded ONGCs ability to expand.
8902 2018-06-12 03:05:58 Make sure it's synthetic oil!
8903 2018-06-12 03:05:36 It’s the opposite for oil. XOP +20% versus -80% for USO. Important to understand what you are buying. Mining for oil > rolling futures. Mining for gold < owning physical gold.
8904 2018-06-12 03:05:30 I have a burn on my thigh from cooking with oil.. Nope.

8907 2018-06-12 03:05:12 My day went well I watched T.V but then I got stuck waiting for 3hours while they change the oil and my tail light at the mechanics. But now I'm watching Rick and Morty and having a much better time. I feel your pain on not wanting to go back to work tomorrow.

8909 2018-06-12 03:04:59 getting splashed by oil on your tummy from making tostada shells is real pain
8910 2018-06-12 03:04:56 The US has no "allies" or "coalition(s) of the willing", the US just has vassal states who are forced to buy oil/energy using the fake/unbacked US$. Loyalty (or lack of) will become VERY clear as US$ hegemony is undermined.  You are just seeing the first shots being fired ...
8911 2018-06-12 03:04:18 Which American workers are suffering? The subsidized mega farms, the subsidized oil companies, or the Wal-Mart and McDonald's work who are government subsidized because their employers don't pay a living wage. Must be Canada's fault!
8912 2018-06-12 03:04:06 Cuticle oil before bed is a saving grace, FYI
8913 2018-06-12 03:03:57 I tweet about this oil like people give a damn, I'm just routinely surprised how much it's calmed me down. I especially like how it's lowered my stubbornness. It's OK to use Twitter features that are designed to make this place less of a steaming pile of garbage.

8948 2018-06-12 02:58:52 I thought Obama was an ass to cancel it, caved to special interest groups.  Energy East should have been approved here, makes no sense to rely on so much foreign oil when we have lots of our own.  Also don't think we should be enriching countries who are such human rights abusers

8958 2018-06-12 02:56:50 They pour oil on you. Then shoot you, which ignites the fumes. Just to make sure, they electrocute until you stop moving.

9104 2018-06-12 02:36:44 The reason @realdonaldtrump didn't try to negotiate a better deal was because no deal was better for his oil producing donors and Putin.
After the US pulled out of the Iran deal oil prices went up and now Russia is raking in the rubles.
9105 2018-06-12 02:36:25 The tariffs - which trump proposed - will increase cost of goods sold. Oil prices already higher.  The Federal Reserve Bank will be forced to raise rates to fight inflation and risk stagflation or an outright recession. Credit cards and variable rate loans at greatest risk.

Don't just tell us what others haven't done about things. What will YOU do? Complaining isn't a strategy that's going to change anything.
9161 2018-06-12 02:28:47 Fuck a dermatologist’s opinion...
Coconut Oil and Honey all day 
Yeah I put food on my face!
Fuck the bravado, eat an avocado 
9162 2018-06-12 02:28:44 "Oil ok or lotion before we start?"-He smiled and bit down on his bottom lip.  He loved seeing Steve almost bare, it was a side not most saw. Granted he loved him in his uniform but there was just something raw and special like this.- 

"Lotion is Bourbon scented."-Bucky's~
9163 2018-06-12 02:28:38 Peppermint oil on temples, top of eyebrows and in between eyebrows! Put pressure while rubbing it in :) I also find massaging my jaw helps (clenching teeth due to stress causes tension headaches and jaw pain)
9164 2018-06-12 02:27:53 I’m very distressed about this new factoid information. Mine is probably “don’t tell people that palm oil is inherently bad! Just make sure products you buy are RSPO certified-palm oil is okay if it isn’t grown by chopping down rain forest to plant the palms”
9165 2018-06-12 02:27:38 I’ve got a little 4.5 ltr 6230 runs like shit without fuel conditioner injectors sticky from low Sulfur fuel ?fuel conditioner fixes it every time maybe the lube in it?have heard of putting engine oil in fuel to fix this problem not game to try myself
9166 2018-06-12 02:27:38 I think the orange/sherry sauce sounds amazing. Pears might be over powered by the orange, but if you glazed them alone they'd be good, too. My biggest recommendation is to score the fat (not all the way to the meat) and start it on medium low, no oil in the skillet.

9169 2018-06-12 02:27:29 You said it, own it, toots.
9170 2018-06-12 02:27:16 waiting for that special someone....to save me from the oil ghosts....
9171 2018-06-12 02:26:50 Why do we continue to listen to the left and these so called environmentalists pushing this blather.  We have clean fossil fuels that built this country and are much more efficient than a windmill.  Obama tried to sell this snake oil and failed.
9172 2018-06-12 02:26:41 Oo I also meant to say for a less expensive option I like the Yes To Coconuts Lip Oil but it can wear away kinda fast and needs to be reapplied often. Also drink lots of water and consider a toothpaste/face wash without SLS if it stays an issue.
9173 2018-06-12 02:26:38 Oil paint is kinda hard
9174 2018-06-12 02:26:29 Same! When you and @mandy_velez have your date in NYC you'll have to let me know so I can crash it.
9175 2018-06-12 02:26:18 That rosehip oil Devon gave my for graduation is making my skin feel amazing. Holy shit. 
9176 2018-06-12 02:25:57 I need a boyfriend so he can massage my scalp with castor oil

9180 2018-06-12 02:25:31 For over 7+ years my skins has be great thanks to @ivannasimply. Today, I ran out of the Chilean oil her family buys for me....that oil is only sold in South America or Spain 
9181 2018-06-12 02:25:30 Soy sauce, almond butter, lime juice, chili flakes, sesame oil, and maple syrup

9185 2018-06-12 02:24:49 uyy painitin mo muna yung oil kasi buo buo pa.
9186 2018-06-12 02:24:45 I've heard the same. Soap is ok once in a while, you just need to recoat with a little oil.
9187 2018-06-12 02:24:38 We Need Fresh Oil........
9188 2018-06-12 02:24:36 Peppermint essential oil! Put some in your hands and hold them to your face and inhale. It’s a strong scent but it always does the trick for me

9190 2018-06-12 02:24:28 Bull crap!! Oil companies can make many more recycling centers.
9191 2018-06-12 02:24:21 I brush mine in the shower and let it do as it pleases so I don't have to touch it , oh and hella coconut oil
9192 2018-06-12 02:24:14 Coconut oil and aloe vera are the must essential products that everyone should add to their skin care, I'm into skin care so much now
9193 2018-06-12 02:24:02 They're cooked in the same oil as the breaded stuff and just that little bit of wheat makes me sick 
9194 2018-06-12 02:23:20 I be smelling so natural and fresh....my underarms smell like apricot & tea tree oil & I love the whipped shea butter mixed with my bio oil

9210 2018-06-12 02:20:01 I did a bit of that as a kid. Water quench is scarier than oil quench. Preheat the metal before placing in the furnace too! Set my head on fire trying to speed up the process. I was hardening military grade equipment... bare chested!
9211 2018-06-12 02:19:57 I've been saying that Russia, China, NK & #45 are ALL in cahoots with each other. It's about oil, it's about #45 making personal business deals to benefit himself & family. He's a schemer. He'll say NK & America made a great deal. He wants a PEACE PRIZE He's really setting us up.

9249 2018-06-12 02:15:38 They signed a deal in the 1990s to explore the oil together.  Argentina would have been entitled to money.  Kirchner tore it up because he didn't accept it as an end, he saw it as a means.

9281 2018-06-12 02:11:17 America no longer needs its nuclear arsenal to assert full spectrum dominance over its “international interests” (ie oil markets & proxy wars). We full range of military might, a massive cyber surveillance complex, and veto power in the security council.

9295 2018-06-12 02:09:57 Comparing the time of Trump & the time of Nixon:
Nixon opened the door to China 
Trump has opened the door to North Korea
The Oil Embargo started in retaliation to Nixon's policies
Retaliatory tariffs will start in response to Trump's policies

9302 2018-06-12 02:09:14 He's a loon trying as hard as he can to fit his descriptions to his own bias. Dr. Oz has "credentials" too, but he's a snake oil tv huckster
9303 2018-06-12 02:09:12 That's for the islanders to decide.  And as long as Argentina maintains the claim, they drive the islanders harder into the arms of the British.
A shame, for Argentina.  All that oil they had agreed to share and then they tore up the treaty under Kirchner.
9304 2018-06-12 02:09:04 fucking still so much i dont understand about death stranding but im loving it more and more.
Also i was kinda hoping stranding would open with kojima on a beach rubbing various things in oil.

9308 2018-06-12 02:08:43 Quinnie has digestive issues left over from a kittenhood spent under the hood of a car, cleaning motor oil/grease off herself. Her ass can peel paint.
9309 2018-06-12 02:08:31 it's actually tenns oil i'm showing the other omegas that i already have a bitch
9310 2018-06-12 02:08:11 To create a metabolic advantage eat freely of protein and the fat that comes along with it, you do not need to consume more fat by eating sticks of butter and drinking coconut oil. No one did this 30,000 years ago. Cut out all the carbs you can , eat meat, fish, eggs mostly #keto
9311 2018-06-12 02:08:11 Use baby oil, conditioner or coconut oil instead of shaving cream.
9312 2018-06-12 02:08:08 I do hot stove until it’s dry and then add oil
9313 2018-06-12 02:08:07 @AmericanAir what is the deal with aa2387?!?  Plane was here pilots 15 min late and we’ve been sitting on board since 8:05 (2 plus hours) while we get an oil change!?!  And now no ground crew?!?’
9314 2018-06-12 02:08:00 My friend dog is flighty and the dog's LA doctor said to start her on CBD oil to help her nerves and if that isn't the whitest damn thing I've ever heard
9315 2018-06-12 02:07:47 Tea tree oil is my homeboy
9316 2018-06-12 02:07:37 Thanks to Twitter, the smell of coconut oil now gives me an instant boner.
9317 2018-06-12 02:07:27 When will Hideo Kojima make umbilical ghosts manifest in my home, dissolving me into an oil slick instantly #e3
9318 2018-06-12 02:07:26 Dandan Noodles:
Shanghai noodles with Cri-Lo ground pork tossed in spicy chilli oil, ginger, scallions, cilantro and sesame
Shanghai noodles.
9319 2018-06-12 02:07:24 All I know so far is scary things with hands for feet, umbilical chord ghosts that suck you down in oil, and cheeky babies.
9320 2018-06-12 02:07:21 Theres plenty of weed, oil and edibles in and around where I live. I guess she's looking to make a point and wants to get it legally.
9321 2018-06-12 02:07:19 That little snowflake so wanted him to bash oil and gas companies and he didn't 
9322 2018-06-12 02:07:17 Don't forget cryptic baby oil champ
9323 2018-06-12 02:07:17 rosehip oil is really common to put on your face (dont put coconut oil on your face it will clog your pores). Maybe also try primrose oil pills and/or fish oil which helps rocsea internally. You can also buy a exfoliate brush to dry exfoliate (I heard this helps but im too lazy)
9324 2018-06-12 02:07:10 Clinton gave cash food oil and got Nothing
9325 2018-06-12 02:06:36 Staring at an unopened bottle of antidepressants while prepping my natural face mask, essential oil blend for diffuser and setting up a playlist. Fuck You depression, I will work myself out of this without the meds. It is being repetitive about this process that will beat it.
9326 2018-06-12 02:06:35 Soft-shell crab, chocolate olive oil, white chocolate covered caviar, and pomegranate seeds. What would @LeonHWolf do? #Chopped
9327 2018-06-12 02:06:18 the only problem with jettas is that ita foreign, so parts, oil changes and just about everything else is crazy expensive.
9328 2018-06-12 02:06:13 Pay 75 cents in gas to drive to work vs. Paying 1.50 in solar to charge your ipad .....hmmmmmm
9329 2018-06-12 02:06:08 Every time I see a Death Stranding trailer I understand less. So Norman Reedus is a postman? Who is hiding from oil hands that move time forwards? And for some reason that means he plugs himself into a baby? #PlayStationE3
9330 2018-06-12 02:06:06 Hes doing a good job lieing,  you are all going bankrupt.  No trade soon .meens no steel, hydro ,gas , oil, milk , and so much more. Suck that you love that fake so much.
9331 2018-06-12 02:06:06 Your oil wars are the reason the US economy is in deep doodoo (21T - LOL- all you need is for a little Chinaman to go knock at the White House door and say: " I want my money".)
9332 2018-06-12 02:06:04 Lmaoooo....oil and water...they will never mix....
9333 2018-06-12 02:06:01 The Oil Spill needs to be twice a year  once at the beginning and once at the end @TennStateQues
9334 2018-06-12 02:05:55 So, here's what Putin has on Trump. They both love the Divine Creator. They both love humanity. They both love their countries. They both have zero energy point machines ready for consumers. No more BIG OIL!
9335 2018-06-12 02:05:43 @tesla @elonmusk Glad to hear Pope Francis recent speech to oil execs at the Vatican was basically a "Buy Tesla" endorsement. I am sure he's right. What do flamethrowers have to do with increasing M3 production? Not sure on that...
9336 2018-06-12 02:05:39 Kingdom Hearts 3 & Death Stranding side by side WAS A OIL HARD TO ABSORB. ESPECIALLY WITH THAT AXEL BIT AND  CONSOLE DROP

9340 2018-06-12 02:05:19 i wish omega oil didn't smell so strong whenever i put it in my hair to tame it it smells like i'm wearing cologne and trying too hard
9341 2018-06-12 02:05:17 Simple plastic and some dawn soap with some baby oil... and your in
9342 2018-06-12 02:05:15 Dora continues to grow.  She is now developing about ten green tomatoes and has about a dozen blossoms that will #feedthebees to #feedtheworld her tomatoes will feed me.  I’m also growing Genoese basil.  I’ll use those along with some fresh mozzarella,olive oil,and balsamico
9343 2018-06-12 02:05:07 Adverse health effects of wind farms are ~10% the adverse effects of coal for the same kilowatt. Harm to wildlife is <10% the harms of oil, gas & coal per watt generated. 

Why do you imply, as a craven liar, the opposite is true? You don’t recognize any fossil fuel slaughters.
9344 2018-06-12 02:04:54 Funny how the country is expected to collectively jump on a grenade to protect a Quebec dairy monopoly. But when the Alberta oil industry is targeted by foreigners many of those same people can't pile on fast enough.
9345 2018-06-12 02:04:50 Perhaps you could support the oil & gas sector with the same enthusiasm.
9346 2018-06-12 02:04:43 Like everything else to do with Trump, it likely involves the Russians. My hunch is Putin and Kim Jong Un made a deal and KJU's part of it is to give the impression that Trump has negotiated some great deal. Not sure what Russia is doing for KJU in return. Oil, probably.
9347 2018-06-12 02:04:42 SMH...Did he say...Chocolate Olive Oil?
9348 2018-06-12 02:04:37 (  ՞ټ՞ ) ﾝﾌ。

9350 2018-06-12 02:04:06 Flash me like that and our night together is just beginning. 

Coconut oil massage my dear?
9351 2018-06-12 02:04:03 On a scandal-scale of 1 - 10 (let says 2014 dirty politics was an 8). I reckon Labour so far has barely scratched a 3, possibly with the Oil decision.
9352 2018-06-12 02:03:56 Holy water except it’s coconut oil

9359 2018-06-12 02:03:33 I remove my makeup with coconut oil, wash with Pacifica Sea Foam face wash, tone with witch hazel on a reusable cotton pad, moisturize with Pacifica dreamy youth face cream. In the morning I do the same but use 100% coffee bean caffeine eye cream and usually sunscreen

9361 2018-06-12 02:03:20 They should investigate oil futures regarding manipulation!
9362 2018-06-12 02:03:12 そんなんシコじゃん
9363 2018-06-12 02:03:10 Never mind that the Alberta NDP put a former teacher in charge of the world’s third largest proven oil reserves. 

And she’s following a page ripped right out of the Ontario Green Act playbook to replace 33% of the power grid with windmills and solar panels!

#NotleyCountdown
9364 2018-06-12 02:03:09 Oooh! I seem to have moved into a new league of FB spammy guy friend requests. From oil field engineers to guys who went to "medical doctor" and post pictures of tiny bloodied brains in gloved hands.  Yay! #MarkAsSpam

9367 2018-06-12 02:02:39 norma reedus is using a backpack powered by fetuses in tubes to detect black oil ghost monsters and this isn't even peak Kojima
9368 2018-06-12 02:02:39 Ken, do the research and look at the science. CSG, Natural Gas, Oil and particularly fuel oil are huge ongoing polluters and are right up there with coal.
Unfortunately aviation fuel is an equally monsterous issue.
9369 2018-06-12 02:02:36 Also try popping your popcorn with coconut oil. Our movie theater here does this and it tastes AMAZING!

9373 2018-06-12 02:02:14 You want to talk about unfairness, you are ripping canada off for 40 years on hydro, water , gas , oil, steal ,peanuts , cars, and the list go's on. You pay next to NOTHING for all the above. And sell it back to us 36 times more. Thats the rip off. You are a fake and a lier.
9374 2018-06-12 02:02:08 i did my own oil change today im a genuine car boy now
9375 2018-06-12 02:02:07 can you put tea tree oil on a stye
9376 2018-06-12 02:02:01 I didn’t understand what was going on much more than the undead oil whale dream sequence trailer, BUT I can absolutely see how this is a game now!
9377 2018-06-12 02:01:54 L-theanine, Sam-e, cbd oil, Kava kava, hydroxyzine at nights have all helped me tremendously. Anything but benzos imo they make the situation much worse

9383 2018-06-12 02:01:17 .@Gov_Martinez is a tool of #oilandgas; she couldn't care less about having the proper environmental safeguards in place to minimize the impact of oil and gas development on our #publiclands.
9384 2018-06-12 02:01:08 Basically what everyone said and remember to oil it up when dry.
9385 2018-06-12 02:00:53 The G-6 HATE BBQ’s...
9386 2018-06-12 02:00:33 Taking a shower with tea tree oil and peppermint oil have truly helped me get rid of this cold. Y’all been holding out on this secret from me.
9387 2018-06-12 02:00:33 @Costco, how come Kirkland food is not certified as using sustainable palm oil by #RSPO?  We love Costco but love orangutan’s more!  Help us love you both the same!

9391 2018-06-12 02:00:12 There is no way the government can deal with oil from Turkana County yet it has neglected the issue of banditry btn Turkana people and the Pokot people. Many people have died, it's really not good at all.
9392 2018-06-12 02:00:08 It is hardly surprising that the malodorous field of garbology has not attained the popularity of rocket science, oil exploration, or brain surgery.
9393 2018-06-12 02:00:04 Shallow frying tips: Adding a cooled item to the fryer will lower the oil temp drastically. To prevent this, turn your heat up a little bit just before adding.
9394 2018-06-12 01:59:48 Now that he is free he wants his mom free hope someone tells him about coconut oil having medium chain triglycerides and it helps the brain function on oil instead of sugar. Saved many from alz

9397 2018-06-12 01:59:26 You probably can just use olive oil. I liked that the dressing was roasted red pepper (was supposed to be for my salads but I’m stuck on my ginger dressing right now) and something my mom said about Italian dressing popped in my head. It was good. Even better on day 2
9398 2018-06-12 01:59:22 He's a disgrace. He looks ill, tired, poorly groomed, gesticulating like the guy that says, Psst, buddy. Ya wanna buy a watch? Or someone selling snake oil.
9399 2018-06-12 01:59:21 We’re the largest producer of natural gas in the world. We have more oil reserves than u. I mean seriously...you guys can’t even build a pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic ocean
9400 2018-06-12 01:59:14 Invisible oil/ink monster.  At least they seem passive in a cutscene.  #PlaystationE3 #E32018
9401 2018-06-12 01:59:14 My baby got a new tire, a vacuum & a oil change  I feel good for her !
9402 2018-06-12 01:59:12 No one does, not even Kojima. It's about babies... and oil... and aliens, that's all I get.
9403 2018-06-12 01:59:12 PSA that CBD oil is the fucking greatest
9404 2018-06-12 01:58:59 DEMs sad view of reality. HISTORY being made & DEMs try to sell snake oil. sad sad sad.
9405 2018-06-12 01:58:40 Life Hack: Using coconut oil not only gives you a cleaner shave & moisturized skin but leaves you tasting like a snack ur welcome
9406 2018-06-12 01:58:30 Ok now what about the palm oil you are killing the rain forests for? Grow a conscience and start treating our earth that we all love with some respect,and respect the folks that live in these places-it is THEIR HOME you are destroying
9407 2018-06-12 01:58:19 He just wants to see finn smear himself with olive oil

9412 2018-06-12 01:57:36 U might find the EU Commission’s latest report interesting: If we replaced #palmoil w soybean oil, we’ll need 200%+ more land. The high yield of #palmoil means tt area required is lower than any other competing crops.... 1/2
9413 2018-06-12 01:57:33 หน้าหวานเลย
9414 2018-06-12 01:57:32 No soap! Just water and a sponge/scrubby thing. I lightly oil it up again when dry.
9415 2018-06-12 01:57:24 the black oil from the x files makes its appearance
9416 2018-06-12 01:57:13 I have an electric. It is quiet and is on it's 4th or 5th season. 
It has an extension cord, but you soon get the hang of dealing with it.
It is quiet and doesn't smell.
No need for oil chages, new spark plugs, or gas
9417 2018-06-12 01:57:09  Love this!
9418 2018-06-12 01:57:07 Feel the same when Obama was chowing down on hot dogs with Raul Castro at the ballpark?

5. FED THE CUTE STRAY KITTIES NEXT DOOR 

IT WAS JUST THE BEST DAY!!!
9420 2018-06-12 01:57:03 Scrub it in luke warm water with silicone or a chainmail cast iron cleaner. Then pop it on the hot stove and rub some oil into it with a paper towel
9421 2018-06-12 01:56:47 i should’ve left coconut oil alone as soon as i smelled it
9422 2018-06-12 01:56:31 He moved from baby oil to peanut butter
9423 2018-06-12 01:56:00 if one of these famous accounts wants to make a thread on where to get cute and inexpensive dorm room decorations instead of another one telling me to drink water and swim in coconut oil that would be really nice ((:
9424 2018-06-12 01:55:59 They can burn Euro's at my house. I'll take care of all the details.

9465 2018-06-12 01:51:37 Nice cherry picking.  You know the Canadian numbers are driven by Shale Oil imports.  Why don't you post the trade numbers with Russia - which is currently running about a $15 billion surplus.  Doesn't help your case when you look at all the pieces.

9506 2018-06-12 01:48:23 You can get away with a seasoned griddle if you very carefully wipe off excess oil. Not ideal but it works.

But let me ask you a question, Mark. How did you spend that particular government rebate?
9524 2018-06-12 01:45:39 Have you tried Jamaican castra oil?
9525 2018-06-12 01:45:38 Oil I think
9526 2018-06-12 01:45:34 What I learned on my first day:
1. ‘Bacon’ in a southern accent sounds like ‘beer can’ in a Jamaican one 
2. Olive oil gets sap off of hands 
The more ya know
9527 2018-06-12 01:45:32 Truth Hurts! Just FYI everyone Good As Hell was on her album Coconut Oil. She's talking about new singles that aren't on a album yet but could be on her new one.

9532 2018-06-12 01:44:48 Sorry, no: your profession is parasitic, with zero evidence-based research behind it. You should be put out of business as a public health scourge. But ethically, you are worse than that: you actually take money from the sick and gullible for your snake oil cures. Disgusting.

9538 2018-06-12 01:43:56 So true! Instead of doing proper due diligence & using rational thought, many Canadians have bought into this carbon tax fiasco, using the oil sands as the scapegoat! Bottomline - with Carbon tax at about $150/tonne, best outlook for Canada is reducing Global GHG by 0.3%!!!

Everybody was feeling screwed about having to pay...

9565 2018-06-12 01:40:18 1st. We should demand to be paid in EUROS, not US DOLLARS, for our oil and gas and encourage every oil/gas producers to switch from USD to EUR.  This will have absolutely no impact (purely symbolic) except for the monstrous narcissist ego of Trump.

9581 2018-06-12 01:38:06 Darin your tweet is insane.... 1. 40% of Americans don’t own stock plus these gains are offset by rises in oil and healthcare... 2. Unemployment has been dropped steadily since Obama’s second term and he actually add more jobs... 3. Nothing has happened yet in Korea.
9582 2018-06-12 01:37:43 Can I just ask what is the deal with the baby oil and peanut butter  haha @FinnBalor
9583 2018-06-12 01:37:33 Reports of suspected military movements south of Ajdabya Army massing for southern oil and Agdadbia cordon there's no fighting right now.

9587 2018-06-12 01:36:58 yeah oil sykes pissed on me and called me ugly back in 2009 :^(((((((((
9588 2018-06-12 01:36:55 I can't believe that @FightOwensFight gave @FinnBalor a bowl of olives without making a single oil joke.
9589 2018-06-12 01:36:55 Two words; Olive oil.
9590 2018-06-12 01:36:54 Unless Don gives a a pallet of cash and unfreezes their frozen currency and allows their oil back in the market I don’t think it will be the same. Don is crippling NK. Barry paid them off then turned the other cheek. @benshapiro this never trump act is starting to get old

9592 2018-06-12 01:36:27 What did you try? Sometimes when I use too much of the UFO oil, I get weird reactions but I LOVE their Luna oil.

9594 2018-06-12 01:36:08 That’s what I have been doing, I added coconut oil to my mix and my skin is feeling surprisingly moisturized

9596 2018-06-12 01:35:47 I have a friend who is an expert in olive oil tasting. One flavor dimension is missing from that radar chart:
"cat piss"

Ideally, would be zero, but in reality some brands are high on this dimension.

9599 2018-06-12 01:35:37  I make my own paw balm with coconut oil, shea butter and beeswax. I can tell you this because you’re extra AF too.

9605 2018-06-12 01:35:02 I actually thought about adding in some coconut oil too, I still might do that when I mix up the second batch. I'll see how this mixture works out. I mostly did this because I was tired of buying the premixed stuff online for way smaller amounts for way more $$$

9615 2018-06-12 01:34:19 Obama not only pushed aside this EMP threat, but he refused to have a redundant power grid which could have been achieved by leaving Coal, oil, and nuclear plants online.
9616 2018-06-12 01:34:00 Look at that haircut.  Someone’s getting an execution when Kim gets home.
9617 2018-06-12 01:33:59 There is already a civil war going on ...and Ambazonians will not sit back and allow themselves to be killed. No wonder the UN is watching the movie and really enjoy it,UK on the other hand refuse to intervene after deceiving us in 1961, now striking an oil deal with LRC in SC.
9618 2018-06-12 01:33:56 Is it worth pointing out that North Korea always seek a thaw with the West when they run out of essential items such as oil, or is that too cynical? #TrumpKim

9622 2018-06-12 01:33:14 Only if it had coconut oil in it
9623 2018-06-12 01:33:12 the death stranding room is just a pit of oil. the oil keeps getting higher. shawn layden strikes a match.
9624 2018-06-12 01:33:11 I was filling my diffuser for bed and just knocked over the essential oil bottle off the nightstand. Explain to me why I’m so clumsy?
9625 2018-06-12 01:33:08 ohhhh I like that, I have all those things but I might add in some coconut oil instead. >u> I use the Jojoba and E mixture on my hands because they get so dry all the time. I wonder if I would actually be able to go up this summer because I do want to go to zero…

9630 2018-06-12 01:32:29 Fukuda was a sham and a lie. Pure and simple.
I know a lot of doctors wanted to pour oil on the waters by saying Fukuda was "a poor definition", but that is just not so.  Fukuda was a DECEPTION with ONE purpose. To make sure the disease being studied was NOT based on an outbreak
9631 2018-06-12 01:32:20 They really did an oil change and put no engine oil in smh

9633 2018-06-12 01:32:12 Well on some level that may be true if you are ok buying oil, potash, diamonds, hydroelectricity, etc elsewhere. But Canada protects our northern border and have never failed to go to war with us. So we should not let a trade squabble spoil that.

9639 2018-06-12 01:31:15 If you think about it, pesto is just garlic and basil and oil, garlic already in the peanut sauce so it's quite complimentary
9640 2018-06-12 01:31:04 Petroleum is primarily used as a source of energy for transportation (at least 75% in 2017). No matter the difference in value between refined product and crude oil, US is not self sufficient if it imports more energy than it exports. You can't burn actual money in your car.
9641 2018-06-12 01:30:39 Article makes many false claims, such as that oil industry receives "subsidies"(they don't)- while complaining renewables should get even more subsidies. 

Boasting they employ inordinately large numbers of people to produce minuscule energy sounds like a boondoggle.
9642 2018-06-12 01:30:34 Listen. I did everything except Castro oil! That’s next
9643 2018-06-12 01:30:28 This may sound like an Urban Legend but……When I was a kid  the gas station attendant  used to put gas in your car, wash your windows, put air in your tires  and check your oil!

my sauce is gonna be so so good today
9657 2018-06-12 01:29:01 Well, large doors that slide, yeah. But they don't make great event spaces because they're often mostly metal and hot and not at all rustic (though sometimes rusty). Plus they usually smell like oil and old beans.

9663 2018-06-12 01:28:12 Sounds like you might have a blockage! This only works if you're not having any pain but place a few drops of olove oil into your ear and let sit for a few mins. Get a bulb syringe if you have one and irrigate your ear gently with warm water.

9691 2018-06-12 01:24:35 Dumb, or trying to screw over the Canadian oil industry via trade war to prop up Russia’s?

Well, okay, he’s dumb either way.
9692 2018-06-12 01:24:34 Someone had better explain to me how a bunch of oil soaked walkers are fine after burning.

9860 2018-06-12 01:00:42 Yes, I’m here now. Oil up the guillotines, children
9861 2018-06-12 01:00:37 today’s muni smells of lavender essential oil. Feelin blessed, and wondering when this streak of good public transit smells will end 
9862 2018-06-12 01:00:33 Just like a cancer...
9863 2018-06-12 01:00:31 Body massage w/some oil is the only way I’m going to sleep tonight! 
9864 2018-06-12 01:00:26 I’ve probably posted this before but y’all should really try it...

I get bad migraines, to the point of throwing up, having to be in a dark/quiet room, etc. Meds don’t help.

The thing that HAS significantly helped is running an oil warmer with frankincense and peppermint oils
9865 2018-06-12 01:00:06 I feel your pain, brother. The Californians are trying to do the same thing to Texas

9867 2018-06-12 00:59:24 He's also roided out of his fucking mind and yet selling bull shit protein shakes and other snake oil products without mentioning he's also taking a lot of steroids which is really unethical and says a lot about his character.
9868 2018-06-12 00:59:19 1 cal olive oil spray - does a bottle ever run out ? I have teeth younger than the one in my cupboard
9869 2018-06-12 00:59:17 "You have journeyed to the king with oil And increased your perfumes; You have sent your envoys a great distance And made them go down to Sheol.  Isaiah 57.9 #Bible

9871 2018-06-12 00:59:12 Is the fort in Iraq? Why the hell is it there? Oh, that's right....war for oil.
9872 2018-06-12 00:59:00 But if we go back to making buggy whips, whale oil and clean coal, we can rule the world again.. #Sarcasm
9873 2018-06-12 00:58:55 U literraly eating oil, flour and cheese! Like that shit is bad but dont get me wrong its bomb!!!

9875 2018-06-12 00:58:35 Thoughts from PA
9876 2018-06-12 00:58:20 Maybe he could distract from his own “sins” by doing his job and getting an anti-Semitic snake oil salesman who traffics in hate speech off Twitter. #BanFarrakhan
9877 2018-06-12 00:58:15 Try lemon essential oil? What kind of stain?
9878 2018-06-12 00:58:10 Only yam that has sense is Pona. What are the other palm oil dishes?? 
9879 2018-06-12 00:58:09 Locusts is the absolute best term to use in reference to them. “Virus” also applies.
9880 2018-06-12 00:57:57 Summer has come people, do not forget to keep yourself hydrated. Drink lots of fluids and wear coconut oil instead of lotion to hydrate your skin and avoid peeling off like a banana 
9881 2018-06-12 00:57:56 Dude. Charlotte has been screwed for a couple decades. We've been pointing and laughing down here in Greenville for a ling time.  We have stopped laughing, afraid its out turn now.
9882 2018-06-12 00:57:43 Please, he is smart enough to run a billion dollar corporation and hire smart people.  He's no snake oil salesman.  He speaks plain and simple English so even the dumbest people can understand what he's saying, not everyone is a person of erudition- liberals are living proof.
9883 2018-06-12 00:57:43 Or....extra virgin olive oil, balsamic glaze, garlic and fresh basil  
9884 2018-06-12 00:57:41 The really interesting question is WHY such a successful and rich country IS NOT a democracy unlike ALL other high-income countries (minus oil rich ones)? What's "wrong" with them? Is it about "Asian values"? @mahbubani_k
9885 2018-06-12 00:57:34 "All initial expenses for prospecting and producing oil were borne exclusively by the foreign multinationals. 

The Nigerian Federal Government spends nothing of its own funds in the industry, except for cash calls which are paid for by proceeds of Niger Delta petroleum".....4/
9886 2018-06-12 00:57:30 Of course i mean California
9887 2018-06-12 00:57:29 Bentonite clay really does suck all the oil out of your face yes
9888 2018-06-12 00:57:07 どエロい夢を見ていた気がする
9889 2018-06-12 00:57:05 I love your understanding of what a sense of value is. Its all perception and energy. Mathematically sound trumps the BS dollar, which by the way is anchored to oil "energy"...
9890 2018-06-12 00:57:00 Yeah they come to AZ and do the same damn thing!
9891 2018-06-12 00:56:59 back still fucked up. 
cbd oil come through!
9892 2018-06-12 00:56:58 If it comes into conflict with Matthew 22:37-40, a person who chooses love above honor is still walking a faithful path.

9894 2018-06-12 00:56:09 What book was it I read?!  College kids were stuck on a floating platform in the lake, and some sort of creature was trying to kill them.  One girl’s hair fell through the planks and it got her that way!  I remember it like an oil slick or something #goodreads
9895 2018-06-12 00:55:40 Putting jojoba oil on your face >>>
9896 2018-06-12 00:55:37 Harley just got the full spoiled girl spa treatment. Coconut oil massage, paw-dicure, extra fluffy towel rub down, and some treats. She seems content, and not nearly as itchy.
9897 2018-06-12 00:55:29 Let's defence @WatsonPeanut together (
9898 2018-06-12 00:55:19 ask your doctor if coconut oil is right for you

9907 2018-06-12 00:54:22 The sure sign of a failing industry is that it becomes too expensive for its user base. The US has the means of transitioning major areas to solar, and possibly fusion. That however costs money, instead of making money like oil and coal so businessmen don’t give a shit.
9908 2018-06-12 00:54:21 They just keep 'conveniently forgetting' in order to appease their billionaire oil co owning overlords.
9909 2018-06-12 00:54:12 Have you tried mr moxey’s cbd mints? They’re helping me a ton with my anxiety and are much easier to carry around than oil (they look like altoids)
9910 2018-06-12 00:54:12 African Countries Should Think Of World Beyond Oil – Osinbajo: African Countries? seriously how many African countries depend on oil for sustenance? Your comment should have been "Nigeria should think of world beyond oil" Good advise though it will surely be implemented in 2019
9911 2018-06-12 00:54:01 Well oil beef hooked ... they wont be drivin me ...
9912 2018-06-12 00:53:58 Goodbye Idyllwild ... Hello San Diego.  These two gorgeous oil paintings by Janet McAlpine are heading out of town to grace the walls of a home in nearby San Diego.  Congratulations to both Janet and the new owners of her work.  :-)

9914 2018-06-12 00:53:47 Hahaha tp boleh ja try dulu guna oil cleanser tu, terus kan ja kalau okay.. hahaha
9915 2018-06-12 00:53:44 You are a complete idiot. The #USA and #Canada trade amounts to over 600 billion a year, and you are complaining about 133 million! You are truly a #dotard maybe #Canada should cut off our supply of oil and sell it to #China @GOP @Comey @BarackObama @DNC
9916 2018-06-12 00:53:33 Prepping for bbq night and after massaging the olive oil onto the veg and potatoes my cuticles are SO SOFT. I might have a new manicure regimen now.

9918 2018-06-12 00:53:08 Oh ok. What’s your thoughts about cbd hemp oil have you tried it
9919 2018-06-12 00:53:03 Not everything gotta be on social media
9920 2018-06-12 00:52:56 So, you clearly want a VERY HARD BORDER, between the United Kingdom and your break away scotland...
Perhaps we should build a wall.
Good luck, with North Sea oil running out, you will be hard pressed to survive.
But, hey, it’s a free country...

9924 2018-06-12 00:52:21 I shouldn’t have put grapeseed oil in this brownie mix. Tryna be healthy
9925 2018-06-12 00:52:16 A carbon tax is an unjustified imposition on the middle class. Gaslighting people into feeling guilty for consuming any arbitrary commodity be it oil or toilet paper is just sad and pathetic. We have no control over the rest of the world and vice-versa.
9926 2018-06-12 00:52:06 You are in a British garden. Your fingernails are whirring. There are lovers in the drizzle. The dark is an oil spill.
9927 2018-06-12 00:51:56 Why do you believe President Trump is racist or a misogynist? POC and women all through the administration.
9928 2018-06-12 00:51:56 I love sipping oil 
9929 2018-06-12 00:51:55 it’s the non psychoactive ingredient in canabis. and although it’s always been around, companies have found ways to market it towards athletes and push it on IG. it’s literally the new coconut-oil-cure-all 
9930 2018-06-12 00:51:52 Interesting.  I see the world oil market as not being efficient because the cost of oil/gas to an individual consumer does not completely reflect the societal cost of consumption.
9931 2018-06-12 00:51:42 About to tell my gear head partner right now! He hates Tesla so I’m sure he will also pass it on. A rare one on the left that loves his oil
9932 2018-06-12 00:51:31 African Countries? seriously how many African countries depend on oil for sustenance? Your comment should have been "Nigeria should think of world beyond oil" Good advise by the way it will surely be implemented in 2019
9933 2018-06-12 00:51:21 How can you hate yam and any palm oil dish
9934 2018-06-12 00:51:05 Why do you believe that our relationship is abusive?
9935 2018-06-12 00:50:59 Agreed, but then 39.5% of voters chose an idiot manchild for PM.

Why are you so fixated with appearing strong?

PS: If Liberals were serious, they would immediately rescind the the BC tanker ban and approve the Spirit Eagle pipeline and start shipping our oil to Asia.

9952 2018-06-12 00:49:06 Living in an industrial zone. My house is concrete. My door is sheet metal. My bed is gravel. I cook my beans in vats of boiling oil. Wake up every morning and smell the fumes. No coffee in the morning, tar is all I need. This is my life baby and I am loving it

9958 2018-06-12 00:48:17 Informal price targets for a bunch of stuff:

Bitcoin: $150
USDCAD: 1.60
Tens: 2.40%
Oil: Somewhere lower than here
SPX: Who knows
Gold: Unch
Fed funds: 2 more hikes

If you “gotcha” me on any of these INFORMAL predictions I will drop you like third period French.
9959 2018-06-12 00:48:15 Because we don't want those terrorists called soldiers in our region. Besides, those good for nothing Nigeria Army personnel are deeply involved in oil bunkering with our AVENGER warriors. Problem ensued because of sharing formula. Details will soon be out.
9960 2018-06-12 00:48:13 Do you know what GDP is? Do you understand that Quebec dairy and Ontario auto **combined** are multiples less than Alberta's oil industry?
You're flipping out about Trump "paralysing the country" while NO ONE backed Alberta over Keystone...get some perspective...geeez

9970 2018-06-12 00:45:14 As you can see the ND & oil exploration came into being some 52 yrs before FRN was created 

Who funded initial oil exploration? 

Not the North, South East, South West or non-existent Nigeria.

Not from cocoa or coal or timber or  Groundnuts or any combination of these...2/

9977 2018-06-12 00:44:20 Btw coconut oil is great for weight loss
9978 2018-06-12 00:44:16 You're "very troubled?" I'm very troubled that I'm months past due getting my oil changed. Being "very troubled" doesn't do shit.
9979 2018-06-12 00:44:13 My hw for this class was to try to make homemade paint, and after 5+ attempts, I have successfully made a "paint" using paprika and oil 
9980 2018-06-12 00:43:52 Oil was another one
9981 2018-06-12 00:43:50 I had $PBT $SBR $CRT. Always traded weighted to oil.
9982 2018-06-12 00:43:39 And naturally I just spilled guacamole and olive oil all over the comforter  dammit
9983 2018-06-12 00:43:36 This one despises him. Loved Reagan like a 2nd grandad, served proudly under Bush Sr., liked W as a person even though I thought he was thicker than 2 short planks. There is nothing Republican I can recognise or admire in Trump. Lousy snake oil carpet bagger.
9984 2018-06-12 00:43:23 I am having a sweet and heavenly dream that a winsome auburn-haired INTJ oil heiress, philosophically unfastening a French blue beret, strolling nonchalantly with a magical calico Gypsy Vanner horse.

9990 2018-06-12 00:41:32 Just to educate you. The US has a huge trade surplus with Canada. Trump correctly states that Canada has tariffs on dairy, removing tariffs would help every Canadian as it would lower prices. US gets oil from Alberta below market prices. You guys pay market price for oil, deal.
9991 2018-06-12 00:41:24 I have acv and mineral oil in a spray bottle as a toner and midday glow me up
9992 2018-06-12 00:41:18 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.

10006 2018-06-12 00:39:46 And the oil sector and .........
10007 2018-06-12 00:39:45 Oil & massage my scalp so I know it’s real.
