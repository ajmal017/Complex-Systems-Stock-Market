41 2018-11-22 23:44:56 If the illegally imposed tariffs on trade with America’s historical allies remain in place the GDP will falter further and prices will rise. The fat cats who benefitted from last year’s tax cuts will start selling their stocks and the Dow will decline. Bye bye Trump.

52 2018-11-22 23:27:07 "keep our minds open" when reducing stocks is the most common change through Smash rulesets
53 2018-11-22 23:26:50 Not moving the bond market? Look at $HYG. Also, with higher yields on treasuries, it’s attracting money from stocks. The liquidity drain is a problem; they just don’t know it yet
54 2018-11-22 23:25:57 Yeah I am definitely piercing that anti flame shield

Unless games take like 5 mins on average (many three stock matches took really long in Smash4) there's no reason to reduce stocks. "Less hitstun" is not a good reason, esp when moves do a million damage now.
55 2018-11-22 23:24:18 Dude, chill. It's thanksgiving. Have a piece of pie. We don't agree. I think FB is gonna decline in popularity and twitter might as well. Maybe not. Maybe they will both thrive as you say. Personally, I wouldn't touch their stocks, but you should invest if you think its good.

71 2018-11-22 23:10:48 I designed an alt-coin index on contract a year ago, didn't end up going to market. Turn-over is insane. It's problematic in a way that indexing large-cap US stocks is not. We all understand that now. Back then it was interesting research.

81 2018-11-22 22:56:47  you’re taking yearly figures and attributing them to people with less than half a million followers. It doesn’t work that way. Stocks don’t work that way. Get a clue man. Post the ACTUAL yearly chart.
82 2018-11-22 22:55:40 Well we will see how far that goes when people have had enough. We saw something similar happen over Diablo Immortal and how Blizzard's stocks tanked for a bit. This is why I think a crash is coming.
83 2018-11-22 22:55:03 Stocks? To hit someone?
84 2018-11-22 22:54:47 The article however was about buy-and-forget - aiming to pick the solid ”sure” stocks.  knowingcwhen to sell to avoid ”capital loss” is far easier _afterwards_.

89 2018-11-22 22:51:21 To be fair, shareholders can be anyone.  This goes beyond tech obviously, but people that have 401Ks need stocks to do well.  When the stock market tanked, my 401K was annihilated.  I am young enough to hopefully get it filling back up again, but old people are screwed.

99 2018-11-22 22:42:03 It looks like brawl neutral with neutered S4 punish game so that’s good imo since S4 punishes were good and made stocks go by fast and brawls neutral was actual neutral so if we are playing with 3 stock matches should be interesting + fast
100 2018-11-22 22:38:03 I feel this is alleviated by the fact that you start with 4 stocks (lives). With that in mind its not quite as insane
101 2018-11-22 22:38:02 If Martha Stewart can be locked up for this kind of thing, so can Soros.. He doesn't have to have Insider knowledge about what the stocks will do if he can make one move that will tank them.. This man needs to go to prison.
102 2018-11-22 22:37:56 I have no options. all stocks.

104 2018-11-22 22:37:34 my stocks are looking thick n juicy
105 2018-11-22 22:34:16 True.  Also true is that all wealth is "perceived." Stocks are no different than bitcoin. As long as there are few sellers, stockholders perceive wealth. If a few more need to sell, that "wealth" will be revealed as the mirage it is. It's debt inflated fictitious capital.

118 2018-11-22 22:22:24 Tbh if ultimate is less than 3 stocks I'm just not gonna play the game competitively. Smash 4 2 stocks has already pushed me away. I don't want to deal with that for another 3-6 years.
119 2018-11-22 22:22:05 It makes sense to me that you have quotas ,if you catch too much of one species then land it,reduce the time the boat goes back to sea but don't throw it back, it's dead! just daft .I honestly think fish will be back on the menu post #brexit .And DEFRA wll be accountable 4 stocks
120 2018-11-22 22:21:23 I do recall you being a holder of $fat. Clearly you are one of the bitter people who lost lots of money and now want to see others fail. Continue to bash if you like. If you held it before, you know it’s potential; either that or you do zero DD on stocks you buy.
121 2018-11-22 22:20:53 >> Obviously you are only PRETENDING to not understand --- because you expect to make more money by scamming other naive investors.  People like pensioners and wage workers, who do not know why stocks have value, why crypto is a negative-sum gambling game, etc. >>
122 2018-11-22 22:18:11 I didn’t find his comments harsh in the least. Check our research out, we work very hard to improve models, others work very hard to improve their understanding of individual stocks. Everyone needs to find what’s right for them.
123 2018-11-22 22:17:35 Govt shd give loan to retail investors to buy stocks. In case of loss , broker(advisory) shd pay the fine...
This step can make brokers honest and regulatory bodies more responsible.

124 2018-11-22 22:17:15 Thanks for the reply Roger, huge fan & very much respect your views. All I ask is people such as yourself keep an open mind to the tech. Tech stocks have wild swings, it doesn't mean they aren't going to disrupt billion dollar industries, like banking...
125 2018-11-22 22:17:09 Delta 100 and 400 are my favourite B&W film stocks, and Kentmere 100, also made by Ilford, comes in at a close third.
126 2018-11-22 22:16:20 Yes. Capitalism is nothing but a licensed money grab for those who already had old money. same with stocks. gold. cornering the market is easy when you control the market. fake sell offs to lower the price to buy cheap.
127 2018-11-22 22:16:14 So it as it turns out, I’m rated to a lower temperature than Russian film stocks. Ripped the sprocket holes to nothing with 10 frames to go. Going to have to engineer a warming solution for winter shooting. Water bottle in a bag in camera bag should do for now.
128 2018-11-22 22:14:32 How bout the fact that stocks are just plain manipulated regardless of buybacks, fundamentals, etc
129 2018-11-22 22:14:24 @ZARA hi internet stocks will be renewed.
130 2018-11-22 22:13:58 Yeah we’ll have to see how fast stocks go out after a bit. Imo less hitlag means more space for the player to mess up to get hit even harder

203 2018-11-22 21:04:22 PAST MARKET CRASH of 50%.    On 10/1/07, the Dow was trading at almost  $14,000...16 months later it had declined 50% to $7,000.   It took 5 1/2  years before the stocks market again reached $14,000 in early 2013.    So the "buy and hold" strategy isn't always the best strategy.

256 2018-11-22 20:22:31 Smashers again: Less combos so stocks will take longer? Make games take even longer!!
257 2018-11-22 20:17:56 Answers: 
1. Yes
2. Thought you said someone mentioned it in 2011. 
3. No, as nobody asked. 
4. Wherever is cheapest. Only buy them when school stocks are low which doesn't take long in a primary school.

Pretty aggressive tone you are taking. +Don't mistake me for a Labour man.
258 2018-11-22 20:17:32 One reason I prefer playing Melee over 4 is that it's a lot easier to see your mistakes and correct them. It's also easier to adapt imo. When there's only 2 stocks in 4 it's a lot harder to find answers in neutral or get a good look at what you're doing wrong.

271 2018-11-22 20:01:46 And ofc the prices are going to be up That’s clear. But just because their up doesn’t mean they’re going to be * the f u t u r e *. The prices went up. People made a ton of money. Then it died. It’s taken a year for it to go up what, two thousand? I’ll just stick to stocks.

281 2018-11-22 19:52:45 The dotcom bubble and other markets like MJ stocks have had way more capital in their peaks.

283 2018-11-22 19:51:55 the question is how much derivates do the banks still have and are keen to liquidate at all cost. in panic mode market is irrational. OPEC+ jawboning has no impact on market as for now.  it will take time for crude stocks to go down. all this means long waiting until it goes up
284 2018-11-22 19:51:09 So wait. You’re claiming rich people support open borders, while quoting rich people saying brown people, rather than the rich, are responsible for stagnant wages.

How much do you have in stocks, anyhow?

297 2018-11-22 19:42:52 1- the $ amount of the decline in stocks is larger because they started out with a much larger market cap - it’s the percentage decline of crypto that is greater  over the time period you are referencing -

337 2018-11-22 19:20:26 The tax write offs are the main differences.  Capital appreciation is higher potential in stocks.  The income from R.E. can be around 7 to 8 percent and good stocks will only provide a out 3 to 5, but the appreciation potential is higher.  Taxation favor is where the gold is.

377 2018-11-22 18:42:26 Very true. This whole sham w/ the DOJ/FBI & other agencies is the greatest threat to America because it directly dissolves people's sovereignty in the land of Democracy. What good is low unemployment, high stocks, high wages, secure boarders under a regime of bureaucracies.

381 2018-11-22 18:40:51 Stocks going up like twitter numbers
382 2018-11-22 18:39:58 You don't amass that amount of money.....without having inside information on ALL the stocks you own...
383 2018-11-22 18:39:21 why are stocks going down?

because people are selling

why are they selling?

because stocks are going down
384 2018-11-22 18:39:17 Why tech stocks are now Wall Street's turkeys
385 2018-11-22 18:38:55 ppl backdoored most of the stocks last night lol
386 2018-11-22 18:37:07 Billionaire George Soros sells shares in Facebook, Netflix, and Goldman Sachs just days before stocks nosedived ... - The Sun
387 2018-11-22 18:36:49 je suis pas CM Apple, je sais pas si demain y’aura des promos Black Friday sur les AirPods, bonne chance pour les stocks si y’en a
388 2018-11-22 18:35:41 I think that is what we're seeing now, UEX is trading to it's post split valuation. 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 IMO. I believe once the split is complete both stocks will rise significantly from our current collective market cap. Investors stand to make a boat load of money.  Few realize it
389 2018-11-22 18:35:40 Desi black friday sales are a joke. Rare to see shit below 50% off. And even then, it's usually the crap they just want to offload to clear out their stocks. Nothing worth really investing into as a consumer.
390 2018-11-22 18:34:49 Same story with these Weed Stocks. Already seeing many loud Mouths.
391 2018-11-22 18:34:33 Whats up with STOCK MARKET? I have maintained that liberals are trying to tank the stock market -   especially tech stocks - then this report came out: Liberal billionaire   Soros dumps Facebook, Netflix stocks just before they dipped: report
392 2018-11-22 18:34:02 I apologize for any gloating regarding shorting stocks and knowing BTC would crash - especially to my friends and family. Thanks for putting up with my nonsense. :)
393 2018-11-22 18:33:33 the big factor is though is how easily each character can kill and secure stocks consistently, ZSS does a much better job doing that than Marth.
394 2018-11-22 18:33:32 Verizon.  One of the few good performing stocks in my portfolio at the moment
395 2018-11-22 18:32:43 'Stocks fall all the time' so bad timing, i believe itll be back in no time , its the future we jus need to embrace it .
396 2018-11-22 18:32:33 I meant insider trading tips lmao jk, I only started recently just been messing with penny stocks for now, deposit money every week and letting it build then I’ll buy the rocks
397 2018-11-22 18:31:18 Enjoyed the opportunity to help with the Cville Community Thanksgiving dinner this morning provided by the Cville Ministerial Alliance. Kudos to Jim Stocks and James Dawson for all of their work and to Kevin Howerton for preparing the birds. Happy Thanksgiving to all involved!
398 2018-11-22 18:30:41 @lagunitasbeer I've been very much enjoying your IPA. My local Co-op stocks it. Good work everyone. Happy Thanksgiving from Scotland.
399 2018-11-22 18:30:39 Obama's balanced policies dropped gas prices far more w/out tanking the market. Between the crash of stocks overvalued by record level stock buy backs via the GOP tax cut & the oil overproduction market crash my 401k's growth for the yr has been wiped out. You are an epic idiot.
400 2018-11-22 18:29:03 #IfCellPhonesDisappeared I would invest heavily in pager stocks... and phone booths.
401 2018-11-22 18:28:38 Black Friday Specials--From 20-50% off on Dry Goods and 25% off on Live Stocks! Come Check it out !
402 2018-11-22 18:28:36 Because no one wants an xbox imo 
I remember them making bundles despararetly wanting fo sell them & a lot of pawn shops had stocks of xbox ones.
403 2018-11-22 18:28:23 No, they don't because they know how investing in Stocks or Crypto Assets work. They know there is a thing called market cycle. Nothing goes up and up alone.
404 2018-11-22 18:28:07 PSA- If you go to a grocery store today, please be nice to the workers today. They don't really want to be there and want to be with there families too. Also stocks of normal high demand things got sold out yesterday probabaly so don't get mad if they say it's out of stock.
405 2018-11-22 18:27:11 I wished that me in the stocks. OOPS!
406 2018-11-22 18:26:53 IRS needs to take hands off those stocks shareholders which are down on their investments that making couple dollars on some stocks...
407 2018-11-22 18:26:52 Well done @themoneysponge

AIM = steep learning curve. Going forward will not be fully loaded in stocks and hold some cash.
408 2018-11-22 18:26:26 I've made so much money off my weed stocks especially with President Trump as President. No complaints here!
409 2018-11-22 18:24:04 Because each stock has its character. It's difficult everyday to scan stocks & trade it consistently. Atleast for me it's difficult.
410 2018-11-22 18:23:00 he’s so nasty he’d poison folks with e-coli lettuce just to buy stocks in the pharmaceutical company that makes the medicine to cure it. 
411 2018-11-22 18:22:29 Wow!!! What a prediction!!! Anybody can predict stocks will climb in 2019, that's 365 days and approx 252 trading session
Can you narrow it down to weeks or may be a particular week ?
Be an analyst not weatherman
412 2018-11-22 18:22:23 Didn’t know single stocks could be bear markets. Must have slep through that class.

415 2018-11-22 18:20:13 Why did you move away from stocks though?
416 2018-11-22 18:19:20 Cont: for example, signal crayfish have decimated our native species, zander hit fish stocks when introduced and, possibly the most famous, grey squirrels have nearly wiped out our native reds! BUT the way this was done is wrong. Hunting for the table or to protect native species
417 2018-11-22 18:19:12 Kinna have to believe George Soros pulled there Stocks this week like he did to All his U.S. investments.
Think the family is breaking up.
418 2018-11-22 18:19:06 @Morrisons hi there. Please could you see which store near to me stocks Northern Monk’s Neapolitan Ice Cream Pale Ale? I’ve asked them directly but they just ignore me.
419 2018-11-22 18:18:33 Welcome home you two, we’ll meet up week after next maybe? I’ll get the stocks in 
420 2018-11-22 18:18:32 Is it wrong to own stocks in Amazon if you don’t use Amazon goods and services? Is it wrong to own a stock in a company you don’t like in order to make money off their stocks/investments?  “I don’t shop at Walmart or have stocks but sometimes get their gas” is that bad?
421 2018-11-22 18:17:45 715 billion how much goes to the defense industries (controlled by trump’s rich friends n trump may have stocks himself) vs directly helping the soldiers check out the pay raises the past twenty years compared to what’s trump is bragging about
422 2018-11-22 18:16:21 Remember when Draghi was asked what's the first thing he looks at when he wakes up every morning? (Stocks)
423 2018-11-22 18:15:45 Gold/Silver getting even with uranium stocks here in terms of setting up.  Lithium/Cobalt is a next year situation.
424 2018-11-22 18:15:07 Unpopular opinion, The Common Fisheries Policy is the worst way to manage fish stocks, except for all the others. That's not to say the #CFP shouldn't be reformed, but we do require that sort of Multi-national framework. #Brexit
425 2018-11-22 18:14:32 Hmm. Does your lab have space for a set of stocks?
426 2018-11-22 18:13:37 I miss trading stocks. 2 more months and I should be ready! I miss money mondays
427 2018-11-22 18:13:33 Trump at Plimouth 1632; he would have been put in the stocks until he was remorseful & cooperative. He would never have been elected anything, & the women would have washed his mouth w/ lye soap routinely. They'd have sent him back. (would be a good SNL skit  ;)
@plimoth @nbcsnl
428 2018-11-22 18:12:07 Whoops - that's embarrassing  Thanks for letting us know - you win the knowledge that you are amazingly vigilant 
429 2018-11-22 18:12:00 I learned the basics from @timothysykes dvd’s. @madaznfootballr helped me realize my trading style and really simplified things. But really I watch and read anything and everything I can get my hands on and watch stocks move on the charts until my eyes bleed.
430 2018-11-22 18:11:55 We used to say people pre sale on stocks and equities where "rich on paper" when its crypto what's the new term to be? 

Sans paper thoughts.
431 2018-11-22 18:11:30 Thanksgiving sales are like gambling or stocks. That thing you really want might be 20% off for 3 DAYS ONLY right before Thanksgiving but what if you buy it AND THEN they make it 30% off for Black Friday or Cyber Monday?! My plan is to hold out as long as possible.
432 2018-11-22 18:11:00 Stocks dropped, i kind of predicted it. But the funniest thing i was predicting President Trump getting himself in trouble when he was saying last year “stocks up because of me”.   This was foolish. I told my friends : “ and what he is going to say when stocks tank next year?”
433 2018-11-22 18:09:31 Gas prices have nothing to do w/POTUS. They are "Commodities". Not stocks. The prices are set a YEAR prior to the current calendar year. That's why traders are called "speculators". They guess at their worth. Might as well go to Vegas. Farm crops aka futures are the same way
434 2018-11-22 18:09:02 Provident $ppr.ca $PRPRF bought back another 20,000 shares today! 

At this rate will dry up cheap liquidity and resume back to pre merger levels of 0.39 cents!

400k buyback a month that's a lot! Considering Goldman Sachs $GS owns 50% of the float

435 2018-11-22 18:06:43 It’s crazy to think that in the past 2 years I haven’t asked my parents for money, bought my own car, pay my own bills, buy my own clothes and jewelry, give my parents money and now investing in stocks just at the age 18... can’t thank my mom enough for raising me this way 
436 2018-11-22 18:05:56 Overfish their own stocks? You're not making a good argument here.

440 2018-11-22 18:03:10 entered. (Not an airport.) I personally think it's too late for gun safety in the US. There are too many guns in circulation, even if automatic weapons/bump stocks are banned. I fear for my grandchildren's lives. Their schools are locked. Were yours?

445 2018-11-22 18:01:04 Hi, Butch. Technicals aren't a part of CML Pro, but as the pivots go...

Think of a stock price like a train.

Each pivot point is a train station -- stocks tend to stop there (even if briefly) then move on. The direction is the hard part. The crucial stops are 200DMA, Yr Hi/Lo.
446 2018-11-22 18:00:50 Enjoy the turkey, the stuffing, family, and friends, and #HappyThanksgiving but beware Black Friday; the sale of #stocks on Wall Street might be bigger than the sale at the mall. ~ Alessandro Bruno, Lombardi Letter

453 2018-11-22 17:59:44 The 1939-1945 war continued as long as it did because Nazis had allies in nations they invaded. Could it have been shortened if citizens of about-to-be-invaded nations had destroyed food stocks & left, as happened in Moscow when Napoleon invaded? @PYMLibrary @QuakerUNOffice

455 2018-11-22 17:54:52 The keyword is indeed focus. My problem is that I'm not able to choose what type of trader I want to be. As I see some intra day trades on Nifty/BN. But then I also look to momentum trade mid cap stocks. Meanwhile, trying to learn market profile, order flow & option strategies 
456 2018-11-22 17:54:42 Well, I like to think of it being a lot of work for such a short release schedule. Mega corporations like EA want games out and they want them out fast so they can get the most profits as soon as possible. But i think the live services help them sustain their stocks so its stable

462 2018-11-22 17:49:41 I think some stocks still have overhangs from placings 6, 9, or more months ago.  They just drift down as they never attracted the necessary liquidity.

Some have great assets and potential, but are cash poor.

Did you notice, right after the 2018 election, when Democrats took over the house, stocks started dropping? Demacrats are bad for the economy.

472 2018-11-22 17:41:03 An evenly split portfolio over all those stocks would have performed fantastic.
473 2018-11-22 17:39:48 check out those employee owned companies.  how is that ownership accomplished?  through publicly traded stocks and profit sharing retirement plans.  It's not like all the employees are out there risking their own wealth and future to help the company succeed.
474 2018-11-22 17:39:26 Why Index don't go much lower is simple, 
If a stocks falls down from 6-3 it's down 50%, when the same stock goes up from 3-6, its up 100% .. 
When stocks doing more zig zag the less chances of Index falling below 7K - Index management.
PSU Bank stocks are way below 2008 lvls.
475 2018-11-22 17:38:55 Thanks to @quakes99 I keep listening to what the #experts have to say about Uranium, mainly @FootnotesFirst and his guests on 'talking stocks over a beer'. No one's got a crystal ball but everything seems to be lining up nicely for a U run. Yee-haw.
476 2018-11-22 17:38:49 A) took over the stock was 9. It’s now 50% off
B) every single CEO annoucment on corporate structuring has caused the stock to crater

492 2018-11-22 17:29:16 European Stocks were lower as investors remained cautious over Brexit negotiations and Italy's budget concerns.
493 2018-11-22 17:28:47 Gold and Silver stocks tend to be a safe haven in times of stress, although Morgan Stanley bucked that trend with a heavy downgrade on Silver miner Fresnillo dropping their price target from 1100p to 715p, shares in Fresnillo closed down 12.1% at 802p
494 2018-11-22 17:28:34 Sadly I think most of the UK is too self-absorbed and focussed on #Brexit, #BGT and #whattheyallwantforChristmas rather than a humanitarian crisis of grotesque proportions that is erpetuated by their pension funds love of weapons company stocks and shares.... #Britishvalues
495 2018-11-22 17:28:27 Brexit sensitive stocks rallied with the pound as it appears the UK and the European Commission agreed on a draft text outlining future ties following Brexit.

501 2018-11-22 17:21:11 Another sweetener for those with vested interests? Tank the market so that currency and stocks are cheap, sign the deal, boost the market and those who invested during the drop make a handsome profit. Par for the course, I would say.

505 2018-11-22 17:19:58 I want to say something about banning bottom trawling....but have to realise my audience here.....

But yeah, leave the seabed intact.  Destroy that and you destroy your own livelihoods fisherpeople!!!  And more no-fishing zones is a must.  Let stocks recover.

521 2018-11-22 17:11:09 The Markets seem to fear 'No Deal' although logically that is a remote possibility because Politicians fear it also. This implies buying Stocks now could be good but I think it is too early because the Fear of No Deal means more falls possible.

531 2018-11-22 17:07:02 What is simple is this. If we alone can fish them the waters,we do. Whatever we catch we can sell or eat WTO. We certainly won’t be fishing as much as is now, no boats. The fish stocks will then recover. There will then be no fish dumped at see dead so that EU quotas can be met.

552 2018-11-22 16:49:53 I think bump stocks are an unfortunate development.  They blur the longstanding distinction between legal semiautomatic and highly controlled full automatic firearms.  Either EO or a law has problems.  EO could set bad precedents and a law might have added bad restrictions.

613 2018-11-22 16:13:07 But in a market for financial advice, and especially where the previous generation made a killing in stocks, the people who tell you what you want to hear (don't save, retire early!) crowd out those who speak truth.

620 2018-11-22 16:12:02 Unfair or not, it’s a truism that when a money manager warns of risk, he thinks markets are mispricing risk. Well, the markets were right (US$ did not get “debases”) and the letter writers wrong. It was a bad trade to be out of USD and growth stocks.

623 2018-11-22 16:10:31 Yes the market is volatile but it is good time to invest as most stocks are trading at their multi-year lows. Do not jump in, get good research advice and be patient. The market is expected to pick up after the 2019 elections.
624 2018-11-22 16:10:23 A bear market...all these morons came out of the woodwork again yesterday talking about all the "wonderful companies on sale." Unfortunately, its not the companies that are "on sale," it's their stocks, which ultimately are just pieces of electronic paper...
625 2018-11-22 16:08:53 le Black Friday pour les riches c’est de la surconsommation ? non ils ont déjà ce qu’ils veulent... ceux qui n’ont pas les moyens ils attendent ce genre de truc pour ENFIN consommer, pas pour surconsommer, nuance, les stocks changent pas pr les magasins
626 2018-11-22 16:08:16 aspects beyond U can not be ignored.  Then those cashed up with low floats and honest management are good to go.  So, the last time U took off V did not.  But today both and Titanium have done well too.  The last time $0.40 stocks went to $10+.  So, some stocks are set up better

628 2018-11-22 16:06:48 ya i don't see new mkt hi's anytime soon. 2019 spx earnings estimates are way too high.  still think Fed ends up buying corporate debt next crisis, that will be the bottom and time to really buy stocks
629 2018-11-22 16:06:35 Tbh, I'm only concerned with Jisoo not getting a solo. Like how is YG not gonna give Lisa a solo when her intl popularity is CRAZY, even non k-pop stans know her.

654 2018-11-22 15:53:49 I was going to follow up on that but wanted to give you space to answer first. That is distressing to me on one level because is it indicative of huge stocks of unsold filament or as you’ve said are people just expecting everything cheap.

657 2018-11-22 15:51:56 From what I understand, they are in the final stages of the process to ban bump stocks.  And although the NRA hasn't voiced support, they have stated that this was something they would not fight.  But since this would make Trump look good, ain't nobody gonna talk about it
658 2018-11-22 15:51:49 Whoa whoa whoa, are u telling me buying junk stocks on 5 cent pull backs isn't an edge?
659 2018-11-22 15:51:44 Hi Joanne, we’re sorry to hear you’ve been disappointed. Our Kevin the Carrot toys have been very popular this year, so stocks ran out quickly. Keep an eye on our Twitter feed for competitions to win some toys. Thanks.

667 2018-11-22 15:45:38 You’re right. Per other reputable financial news outlets, the D’s taking over the House helps because businesses like gov’t stalemate. As for uncertainty, Trump’s trade wars, slowing global growth and higher long term interest rates (due to deficit spending) is hitting stocks.

675 2018-11-22 15:39:47 Since thevObama ATF produced a letter saying bump stocks were ok, my guess is that a ban under Pres Trump will not be supported in court. Changing the regs absent a change in the facts is not legally justified.

681 2018-11-22 15:34:18 FWIW in spirit of thanksgiving didn’t want to go after gerber initially. But the inequality part annoyed me. What could be a further disconnect than pumping elitist products/stocks while hash tagging the fight against inequality.
682 2018-11-22 15:34:01 I notice the same plays happening all over the place across multiple stocks and even the market itself. I'm not sure if it's worth trying to predict the biggest potential movers between days because 5-10x time/effort, but not 5-10x probability/range. 15m charts are awesome tho
683 2018-11-22 15:32:53 It sux. You’re not the only one in this position. The stock market has been brutal. You have a couple of choices. Cut your losses with some of your stocks and reinvest or wait it out. Just my opinion. Good luck 
684 2018-11-22 15:32:46 Also  likely we are making head and shoulder on weekly chart with oscillator diverging .  Pretty bad timing for stocks ...
685 2018-11-22 15:32:37 Okay. And is the contrary also true? That is, if the results are poor, the stocks would rise? Though common sense says the price will fall.

692 2018-11-22 15:29:59 Ups and downs are part and parcel. Sometimes good quality stocks are hammered and are available at dirt cheap valuations. When these stocks will rise then market will go mad about it. I don't track Websol.

726 2018-11-22 15:11:22 actually retroactively mad that we ended up playing 2 stocks for like 2 or 3 or 4 years

also ban Bayo rn lol
727 2018-11-22 15:10:54 The NRA is lobbyist that receiving money from politicians that own stocks in arms producing factories! Fear is what ignite money because everyone don’t want to get caught without a gun! Gun shops are happy!
728 2018-11-22 15:09:19 But it has never been anything like that important in the UK, which is why it made sense for us to accept the CFP and join the EU (with the quotas that defended our stocks and stopped our boats destroying them)

873 2018-11-22 13:19:18 Biggest data point shorts have missed is stock price. It’s just too hard to time cult stocks, especially ones with > 50% of the float controlled by insiders and friends of Elon. Competition is present everywhere in droves, except USA, and that’s because EVs are still a niche here
874 2018-11-22 13:18:48 We're not going to have high gas prices. Arab oil stocks are drying up. 
They know; we know.
Oil = their ONLY $-rev. source.

We are energy rich, developing many alternate sources. Plus, Israel soon tapping into a HUGE source.

We hold the Trump-card.
875 2018-11-22 13:17:35 #Stocks: Mercados cerrados en U.S. por la festividad del día de Acción de Gracias. Los futuros del #NASDAQ bajan un 0.37%, mientras que los futuros del S&P 500, un 0.21%. Por el lado de Europa, las bolsas vuelven al rojo. El Euro Stoxx 50 cayó 0.44% y el FSTE 100, 0.95%.

879 2018-11-22 13:15:34 Fox news:  Liberal billionaire George Soros dumps Facebook, Netflix stocks just before they dipped.  I wish I had this inside info, then my 401K wouldn't be tanking.  No rhyme or reason to stock market any more, lots of people making money on it's peaks and valleys!

882 2018-11-22 13:13:28 His tariffs does and ppl who have stocks are nervous right now because of tariffs and that is something that Trump as caused. The economy is due to Obama’s hard work not Trumps who is trying to take credit for that but the falling of the stock market he won’t say anything on!

884 2018-11-22 13:11:57 ..better training , more than a simple background check when purchasing one, gun registration so if you become unstable authorities know you  have one, and getting rid of bump stocks and extended magazines.   That all seems reasonable and doesn't remove the 2nd.
885 2018-11-22 13:11:34 Now am gonna sell my house worth at 3cr. I will stay in rent for 2years. Am gonna invest those money in mid n small caps. After 2years i will buy duplex worth of 15cr at the nariman point with the fd of 2cr. 5x enough for me. Let's the game begin

888 2018-11-22 13:09:04 You want the constitution as it is written? If that were so, you and your family would be in stocks and you would have rotten veggies and fruit thrown at you. Then they would hang you for treason along with Don Jr. You are the disaster. You are the joke of the planet.
889 2018-11-22 13:08:57 Sorry for the cancelled orders on albums. There are no stocks. We will still continue to ship this weekend until Monday. I hope you understand that. We will refund immediately.
890 2018-11-22 13:08:27 In other words, he traded stocks
891 2018-11-22 13:07:45 Since you're doing SIP,buy at every correction of 20-50%, higher the correction rate buy more number of shares.
Computation of Fair value is difficult & many times we never get stocks below such prices esp.quality businesses.

But yes, plus having a graph serves 'em a visual.
901 2018-11-22 12:59:18 All the Internet stocks looked just like this in 1999-2000. then they turn around and climbed higher over the next decade. So, be warned: this sort of analysis is very hind-sight dependent.

906 2018-11-22 12:57:00 Few interesting stocks offering great DY; look at HPL&R (another special divi probably expected 2H) , ARL (given 2050c paid out) & (hopefully) QFH soon (I'm expecting a fat special dividend as it sits on 200cps of hard CASH)…..
907 2018-11-22 12:56:43 Picking stocks straight from a hat like a bingo isn’t investing either. Fortunately, we have the market getting quite nervous recently and opening the door for more underpriced stocks!

910 2018-11-22 12:55:57 #European stocks declined on Thursday and #US equity futures edged lower in a subdued day of trading thanks to the American #Thanksgiving holiday! The $GBP jumped and the $EUR strengthened after a draft deal on post #Brexit ties was tentatively agreed!
911 2018-11-22 12:55:20 listed in 2004 it is hard to look at that long term data for TCS,
912 2018-11-22 12:55:10 These were STOCKS, crypto's are coins with no P/E ratio, how do you give them a fair value?
913 2018-11-22 12:55:04 All good advice (and saved me the trouble!). I would add one caveat however...

Ideally, I would not get the gait analysis done at a brand specific store. Go to a sports clinic or to a specialized running store that stocks a variety of brands.
914 2018-11-22 12:54:35 Why haven't you banned bump stocks or raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA?

925 2018-11-22 12:47:51 @realDonaldTrump might have Soros on insider trading. He dumped his Facebook and Netflix stocks just before his own paper published its report.
926 2018-11-22 12:46:20 Reportedly some 26 000 tonnes of skimmed #milk powder sold at today's tender. At this pace, stocks will be empty by Easter. What will we talk about then?
927 2018-11-22 12:45:03 It's so strange that people make a different choice weeks or months later, isn't it? It's almost as if we're not actually married to these stocks and they're just commodities. 
928 2018-11-22 12:44:53 And what might that something be? best Congress will do is pass some more laws about background checks, eliminate butt stocks, etc. No big change. I believe in the right to own a gun because we are responsible.
929 2018-11-22 12:44:51 Nicola Sturgeon yet again points at England over her own Government's failure to procure sufficient stocks of decent quality flu vaccines.

938 2018-11-22 12:40:55 ... if they moved to foreign stocks they run the risk of losing lots of money on Xrate when they try to put them back to GBP. Makes sense to stay in bonds particularly for UK institutions.

We'll be tweeting updates and links tomorrow!
943 2018-11-22 12:38:12 Complicated but I agree with your overall point. Problem is most of the gilts are held by UK institutions and BoE. It could be that funds are withdrawing from Stocks into safer Bonds hence the lower yield....
944 2018-11-22 12:36:53 We have enough fishing stocks in our own waters to serve our needs and don't need to fish in EU waters. People could buy properties in other countries before the constitution of the EU. These are not proper arguments.... but here you go again, fixating on technical arguments.

946 2018-11-22 12:34:30 There is a reason the EU want access to UK waters (and they have every right to argue their case). UK waters are among the most rich in the world, and certainly the most abubdant in Europe. UK sourced stocks make up 60% of the ££ garnered from fish sold in Irish ports.

So far that means Reddit...just Reddit.
952 2018-11-22 12:30:04 Seeing so many poor takes by pundits on what the political declaration means for fishing.

EU and UK agree they need to cooperate, as they would have to anyway given the presence of shared stocks. But what that cooperation looks like is still to be determined.

I know both the stocks charts btw
972 2018-11-22 12:18:45 There's is a major problem with high share price stocks, and it's simply called market manipulation, if you allow only some people to trade the stock with a high price, then any institution is able to manipulate the market by putting large orders
973 2018-11-22 12:18:05 also the risk profile could be completely different. for ex Bitmex getting a psy-ops or onramps shutdown creating a crash, many scenarios. With stocks right now people will run for cash, then when cash starts being worthless crypto will be godsend.. a thought
974 2018-11-22 12:17:38 it's was dying; once we control our stocks, then it won't
975 2018-11-22 12:17:17 She is not talking about the ones under threat of closure,  they have one entrance in and out. Typical Tory deflect rather than answer a question. The Tories have under funded them, run down book stocks and then say "look nobody uses them".

985 2018-11-22 12:09:09 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
986 2018-11-22 12:07:17 The problem is how to reach them - most people just see themselves as investing in property in same way they'd invest in stocks and shares leaving the agent to get on with managing.  A gateway is needed to stop such people for their good, tenants & the image of our industry.
987 2018-11-22 12:06:30 Well said Bhai !

People invest in real estate and forget it. Only in stocks people check rates everyday JUST BECAUSE it is easily available.

If people treat stocks like real estate i.e. buy quality shares and forget them..  will they notice how BIG the portfolio has become !

990 2018-11-22 12:04:15 Investors are resilient, buying the dip is always a good option because most investors know only one thing, that is to buy stocks when they are lower. But in a bear market it won't work

1017 2018-11-22 11:45:29 The reasons why Indian Equity market corrected:
1. Rising Crude prices
2. Depreciating INR
3. Rising Bond yields.
Today we had sharp fall in Crude,
INR appreciating sharply, G-Sec yields softening sharply. 
Still, we had stocks falling across the board.
Crazy stuff!

1028 2018-11-22 11:38:53 It is the obvious thing to do. Why don't politicians state more clearly that fisheries is about fish stocks rather than fishery communities? Common arrangements based on assessments of marine biologists that allow for sustainable fishing are crucial for fisheries communities.

20% down (standard)...

20k to buy a 100k property...

Say your return rate is 15%, that’s 15k per year. (gross return of course, but there are tax deductions)

To get the same income of 15k with stocks (20k invested), you need have a 75% rate of return.

1174 2018-11-22 09:16:07 European stocks (inc UK) showed a strong desire yesterday to get on with a rally towards the next cycle peak (due within the next month). The main bearish influence is from the US and they're on holiday, so tricky to tell if US rebound has started too. #FTSE support 6953.
1175 2018-11-22 09:14:23 I can see it now: UK fails to agree on fishery policy, the industry panics and starts overfishing our own stocks "to reinvigorate the decimated UK fishing industry". Then as yields decline, UK govt puts MSY quotas to conserve stocks. At which point, what the hell was the point.

1223 2018-11-22 08:51:00 2/ for every inv since 09. CB have their work cut out for them now. I think they remove themselves from future interventions that whore up markets like this. It is ugly right now, likely to get uglier, and maybe rather than cry about stocks dropping inv should sell some stocks

1225 2018-11-22 08:50:00 If it takes you more than 3 seconds to identify a trend on a chart then it isn't an obvious opportunity and you should look for a trade elsewhere.

1227 2018-11-22 08:49:07 Oddly the few v posh houses I was allowed into as a child all had that awful almost clear hard toilet paper. It was quite shocking as I’d assumed it was only 4 ordinary folk & public toilets because it was so awful. Apparently still found in some stately homes. Using up stocks?
1228 2018-11-22 08:48:22 CB stimi is responsible for the entire mrkt run from 09-17. Earnings kicked in in 17 along with CB juice from everywhere. Inv believed CB would never let stocks fail. In 17 dips never happened. Inv now cry for lower rates to save stocks. CB twisted/distorted inv / price discovery

1232 2018-11-22 08:45:02 The OTC stock doesn’t even carry a bid or buy quote. Far lesser known stocks with a fraction of Bushveld’s valuations on the OTC have the quotes, so I’m sure if Bushveld wanted to, they could do the needful to make this easier, else wouldn’t get US investors.

The reason is because they can be distributed and bought in fractions, unlike stocks.
Do you see what I mean? Or am I wrong?

1337 2018-11-22 07:12:23 The value of the stocks only holds up if the underlying businesses are seen to be healthy long term.

1352 2018-11-22 06:57:54 My view, If you want an investment with return, don’t have a child and just invest in stocks/bonds/savings  if you have a child then do your best for them to have a good future

1474 2018-11-22 05:14:19 I've been trading stocks since '05. I got #REKT in '08/'09. Guess what I did? I bought all solid stocks and held. 5 years later, I bought multiple properties, paid off college, and had plenty of money left over. Whatever market you're in, do you have the balls to NOT capitulate?
1475 2018-11-22 05:14:15 You think you got Stocks. Well. If you don’t sell in the next few days.  You lose 60% ..  don’t make me say that : I Told you so.

Also holding TATA motors 200 shares @301 Should I average and exit at buy price or hold it. Both stocks for very long time horizon.
1480 2018-11-22 05:11:05 Well if markets really tank nearly all stocks will go down.

That's the reality . Over time I've found my brain hurts trying to time everything so I try to make sure I know exactly what I'm getting when I buy something.

That's the parachute

1499 2018-11-22 04:53:12 Plenty of stocks here across the board are cheap.

But most people can't handle topsy turvy conditions and losing money is the perfect panacea for optimism.

So if you can't handle losing money don't take risks ,because  you're likely to act irrationally when you do

1578 2018-11-22 03:46:18 I read today(maybe from your tweet)that George Soros divested his stocks in Facebook, twitter, etc before they crashed.  I used to be mad that so many work so hard and never get ahead financially.  But at my age, I realize happiness isn't found in money.

1581 2018-11-22 03:43:42 The NRA did a tactical maneuver because they knew they'd lose any vote to ban bump stocks. The fear was that other types of harmless modifications would be caught up in it, so they compromised.

Gun owners in general don't support a ban for the reasons I went into.
1582 2018-11-22 03:41:43 Jim, I wonder if preceding judgment on 232 , US based U stocks could become overvalued while non-US ones get undervalued...and then 232 gets dismissed...that would be one big fiasco!

1589 2018-11-22 03:36:53 You too.  It’s just weird.  I mean, the NRA supported banning bump stocks and Trump did too.  Yet, now a year later, nothing.  It’s almost like it was just a bunch of lip service by a bunch of people that have no interest in reducing gun violence.

1604 2018-11-22 03:26:51 If you’re talking about individuals who have inherited their riches... no one is living off of cash. Their cash is invested (stocks, businesses, real estate) and is generating income at a higher rate than the demographic they’ve alerted.
1605 2018-11-22 03:26:29 Buy low, sell high :)

Even if you buy high in crypto... you just have to wait a 2nd market cycle to see your value grow. Great thing about crypto over stocks is that I’ve noticed crypto market cycle moves faster... much faster.

1614 2018-11-22 03:22:29 I have a difficult question to ask:

Why does this feel like Sandy Hook and Las Vegas, and it’s the @NRA saying that people are to blame, not the AR-15 with extended clips and bump stocks.

Maybe it’s just me.

1631 2018-11-22 03:10:08 So again, why would we need to ban bump stocks when it wouldn't have done a thing?
1632 2018-11-22 03:09:51 More you read up on these tax exempt non profit organizations, more they sound like legal tax evasion plus they invest in stocks that donors are making a profit from. Interest rates are 3-5% on short term.
1633 2018-11-22 03:09:50 And my point if he didn't have bump stocks, plenty of other ways to fire faster.
1634 2018-11-22 03:09:12 It matters to all the people that would be alive now but for the excessive rate of fire.  It will matter to the next people in the next massacre.  He could have done those other things, but he didn’t.  So again, why are bump stocks still legal?
1635 2018-11-22 03:09:02 Why do you think gun buybacks and ban on certain types of weapons (like AR15, bumb stocks, large magazines) would be a losing issue?
Talk of confiscation would be stupid, of course.

1637 2018-11-22 03:08:36 Will be interesting to see how Tier-1 canna stocks perform in a rough, late-cycle economic downturn. Never happened before. Like the internet, we all knew where it was going circa 2001. Trade timing now just as important as being right. Good cost base = easier decision.
1638 2018-11-22 03:08:26 #Investing 

Simple experiment.

# make a portfolio of 10 stocks, 10% in each
# make a portfolio of 25 stocks, 4% in each

NOW see which move 5% higher quickly. 

U will see that #diversification is a pain & only INABILITY to pick stocks can justify it.

1640 2018-11-22 03:07:50 As the DOW continues to deteriorate I have pretty much moved away from trading penny stocks ... I will speculate now in the bigger more liquid names using a disciplined approach, respecting the stop loss and positioning the trade size as a portion of the overall PF.

1658 2018-11-22 02:53:02 The point is, America’s latest Melt Up is getting started, and while everyone else is worried that the bull market is over... or that stocks are dropping... you can be one of the few to fully take advantage of this huge, life-changing move.
1659 2018-11-22 02:52:55 Not absurd at all. Its simple facts.

The military needs for the M249 vs M16 are irreverent to this discussion. He could have done just as much damage without bump stocks. 

Don't be deliberately obtuse.
1660 2018-11-22 02:52:23 It was all you. The hundreds of other times oil barrel prices plummeted it was an accident,  but this one is all you.  Stocks down for the year...not you. Gas down, you.

1695 2018-11-22 02:24:36 Stocks in Asia got some reprieve from the recent sell-off after a  modest rebound in technology and energy shares underpinned gains in U.S.  equities.
1696 2018-11-22 02:21:24 As a marketing person, I find this article amusing because they mention nothing about rising global #soybean production. 
Even without the tariff war, US soybean stocks would have been overproduced, this just made it worse and more obvious

1699 2018-11-22 02:16:47 Not asking about if you want to own an Apple product but would you want to own the Apple stock?  I don’t drink or smoke but I have certainly made money on alcohol and tobacco stocks.

1703 2018-11-22 02:05:46 FAANG stocks kicked their own asses with all that #censorship garbage and took down the 2018 stock market gains with them.

Hope it was worth the hundreds of billions they lost putting a woman who can't remember George Bush isn't President back in the Speakership.

1791 2018-11-22 00:54:41 Other than that stocks have higher volatility than other investments (necessitating some investment in other assets), basically correct. If you want to make $, go to election prediction markets (where most participants seem to be certifiable morons -but that might change).

1802 2018-11-22 00:49:12 Sterling would probably drop but not if a people’s vote amendment is passed to rule out No Deal. And UK stocks usually go up when sterling goes down. Remember 2016.

Since you are never fast enough to beat the information then trading stocks is a waste of time and money
Since stocks do well over the long run then the only logical thing is to have 100% of your investable money in stocks.
1805 2018-11-22 00:47:17 I gave my niece 3 Stockpile certificates last year for Christmas (she was 13) and sat down to help her pick out what stocks she wanted. She picked Disney, Netflix... and VTI. I was super proud.

1808 2018-11-22 00:43:53 I have done my research.  Bump stocks are illegal in Canada.  So someone who tricks out their firearm is breaking the law.  I am 100% with them getting in trouble.  But at the end of the day it’s still a semi auto rifle,  like many legal rifles already in Canada.

ROBERT COVINGTON LEADS THE NBA IN STOCKS (58)
1812 2018-11-22 00:41:29 My question exactly?  If we already know the Playbook is to turn the liquidity spigots back on why won’t stocks react the same as they have in the recent past?  I know there is an end game to that process but I am not convinced we are there yet.  Open to be proven wrong though.
1813 2018-11-22 00:40:56 cont- You put three Jews in a room, you get 1,000 opinions. This is a plus and a negative, because, the ability to collaborate is a gift, relevance is another, one maybe gifted in stocks and real estate, this does not make this one qualified to speak. So, I will request to do so.
1814 2018-11-22 00:40:55 Kind of like Tweeting "stocks are going down, but real estate is up. So what happened to the price correction?"

I'm surprised U PA hasn't pulled your degree back.
1815 2018-11-22 00:40:26 Yes, agreed. Equity volatility likely to decline and stocks set to rally from here
1816 2018-11-22 00:40:20 You have had ZERO effect on driving down gasoline prices. But you have had A LOT to do with driving down stocks prices and wiping out all of the market gains for 2018.

1831 2018-11-22 00:31:47 As an investor, I hate to see it go, but have been shifting out of stocks just because of Trump.
1832 2018-11-22 00:31:10 I think we have been making a bottom in Chinese stocks like $HUYA $IQ $BILI $BZUN $SOGO $SINA $YY $WB $BABA $TECHY $BIDU . Don’t think so they go -20% lower from these levels. Chinese indexes also making bottom. Let’s hope good words at G20 summit. Trump can’t afford
1833 2018-11-22 00:30:26 Don't think oil stocks stocks - think economy.  Something like 85% of global economy - businesses and consumers - benefit when oil goes down - gas, transports, plastics etc

1836 2018-11-22 00:26:42 Cramer Recs many stocks based on their chart patterns as he has admitted. There is no way he is familiar with many biotechs & relies on others to tell him or just supporting people who will come on his show & fill up air time

1838 2018-11-22 00:24:56 Are you saying Obama printed money and bought stocks of companies on the DOW? Do you know the difference between a stock and a bond?
For a year, Drumpf bragged about the stock market. Are you saying that the value from where he started and built upon was inflated?
1839 2018-11-22 00:24:34 Trying to learn Ihor..... why the elevated borrow % if it’s only 20% of float?  Other stocks have 20% of float shorted and are 1-2% fee
1840 2018-11-22 00:22:16 Buddy we cant predict wdout data.Even if we believe wt say is true-Gold was 10% high near Dusherra due 2 high demand,weak Rs etc.Many stocks at 52 weeks low so dr r possibilities dt money got diverted.Also High Oct GST suggest more spending by people.I rest my case here  :)
1841 2018-11-22 00:22:08 What a great bunch good news Bill. We are still picking up those oil stocks for pennies on the $$. Stinking it to those westerners that vote for Cons anyway
1842 2018-11-22 00:21:24 why are stocks going down? 

because people are selling

why are they selling? 

because stocks are going down
1843 2018-11-22 00:21:01 Yes each boy has one share. I’ve found they understand the stock concepts better when they’re little through single stocks in companies they know. Indexing they understand better when they’re a bit older
1844 2018-11-22 00:17:59 Why will most go to zero? This is often said but you are not accounting for human greed, the reason we have penny stocks is due to greed, the idea you can purchase millions of them and maybe just maybe you’ll get rich quick if suddenly they realise there pipe dream
1845 2018-11-22 00:17:53 Stocks and stones? Is that like sticks and bonds?
1846 2018-11-22 00:17:15  get that public liability  business plans after 6 pints in stocks #wamma

1848 2018-11-22 00:16:08 4.| governments and investors.Then there is a comparison of which countries have a major influence on changes in world oil prices. World oil stocks are moving up and down as the activities of three major countries, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.

1849 2018-11-22 00:15:43 Can somebody tell Agent Orange the stocks are down-500!
1850 2018-11-22 00:15:04 Tx. Really that so many stocks & funds have too much exposure to NPN/Tencent/tech companies. Don't even want to think about PIC nt actively managing gov employee pension fds. Do they nt know about risk management?
1851 2018-11-22 00:14:11 HIGHBEAM UNITY stocks slump
1852 2018-11-22 00:13:44 Now I have come to a point where I don't want to lose anymore money, I want to slowly sell all the individual stocks I own now and, probably not take more than 1 or 2 positions per month going forward. How should I go about putting money into index funds and be safe.
1853 2018-11-22 00:12:55 Looking at the late 2015 play-book, thinking we get one more dip in GLD next few weeks together with a rally in stocks. Then it will be time to pick up those GLD OTM call options (and re-short stocks). Note also strong GLD seasonality last five yrs--similar pattern shaping up.

1857 2018-11-22 00:09:53 Meanwhile all the stocks look up? What yahoos
1858 2018-11-22 00:08:38 For me I work in a top 10 global company and there are a lot of exciting blockchain partnerships but we are still 3 to 4 years away from implementation.  Crypto is still young and needs time to prove itself much like dotcom tech stocks.  I ignore short term events.
1859 2018-11-22 00:08:38 If they’re too young for an IRA you could get them each a share in a company they’re interested in. Like Disney or Nintendo. Thats what I did to teach my boys about how stocks work. They were both proud to be “owners” of the companies

1863 2018-11-22 00:02:12 Here's the point people; WE DON'T TRADE THE MARKET, WE TRADE OUR BELIEFS ABOUT THE MARKET. If you believe that buying stocks at high is what works you will find 1k examples that will show you that it does,

1865 2018-11-22 00:01:10 It will stop when this beast gets hungry, alternatives for platforms is inevitable, they crave money and prominence, what did stocks do this week? GOD will make a way where there seems to be no way, HE works in ways we can not see but GOD will make a way, GOD will make a way!!!!
1866 2018-11-22 00:00:51 How nervous are you?   Stocks like BA and NFLX seem to have a ton of room on downside.
