38 2018-05-16 21:51:44 Refugees are like commodities for sale. The sale is cloaked under a humanitarian logic and ‘good governance’ fallacy to make relocation permissible. There is no doubt that governments are complicit in the supply chain of refugees — that’s perceived as a lucrative business model.

40 2018-05-16 21:32:44 But note that the internal consumption market is a larger portion of the Brazilian economy than commodities. You still can find Easter eggs in some supermarkets and in some stores.
41 2018-05-16 21:10:20 I’m less worried about interest rates rising than about inflation.   Could easily see a market similar to 70s stagflation. Pairs well with agriculture and commodities technicals

52 2018-05-16 20:03:12 I'm cosmopolitan AF, and honestly I'd support a non-resident tax on house ownership. Houses should be homes first, not commodities. (I say this knowing that non-resident ownership is fairly small and not even close to being the main cause of unaffordable housing prices.)

54 2018-05-16 19:42:46 Moving up slots in the MLB draft can be important. Signing or trading for proven commodities to improve your championship caliber team is much more important.

55 2018-05-16 19:40:44 Our book isn’t about diversity. You clearly didn’t read it or you’d know that. It’s about A) even if you have powers, the system will try to control you. B) That having powers doesn’t change the fact that black people are treated as second hand citizens or commodities.

69 2018-05-16 18:43:05 Well until such time as we implement those alternatives we cannot live without oil and gas because humans, while resilient, still rely on food and water to survive and both of those commodities are dependent on the energy supplied by oil and gas.

76 2018-05-16 18:10:50 Commodities / TIPS decision driven by product scale (liquidity), perceived breadth and differing views on inflation sensitivity / confidence in LT commodity risk premium. Reasonable room for disagreement, and we debate it a lot internally. Having neither had not occurred to us.

78 2018-05-16 18:02:58 @InvescoUS explicitly excludes TIPS from their RP implementation (and EM). What would be the case for excluding TIPS? Commodities more sensitive to inflation shocks in the short term? While Bridgewater, Panagora and AQR @CliffordAsness include both
79 2018-05-16 17:56:21 @EconomPic  I don't like their implementation of risk parity. Using energy stocks as proxy for commodities that are already a proxy for inflation... Also, the credit charges on the swaps?

93 2018-05-16 16:31:46 They're treated like commodities that's why. No matter where and how they were raised, they will be killed violently. And because they, like us are sentient this matters greatly.
94 2018-05-16 16:22:15 Are Congress and JDS elected MLAs sheep that BJP will kill like vultures and they are taken in resort hotel. Are their elected MLAs "SALEABLE COMMODITIES" who are selling themselves?
95 2018-05-16 16:19:08 Debe ser porque cualquier cosa después de ese zafarrancho inicial no podía no ser mejor. Por otro lado, el alto precio de los commodities le apuntaló la "gestión"
96 2018-05-16 16:15:51 There’s also the fact that the regulations set in place in the 1930s that they are going on about were fAirly basic and designed to keep small market commodities (IE electricity and similar services) priced competitively
97 2018-05-16 16:12:42 From 200-2018, Africa's biggest commodities were, slaves, coffee, gold, and fraud. With British colony Uganda taking the center stage.... Thanks to Middle East open slave markets!

100 2018-05-16 16:03:01 China could simply buy $100bn in oil or any other commodities and re-sell. Deficit accounting issue solved but in reality nothing has really changed. Elevating the deficit absurdity to the infinity power.
101 2018-05-16 15:58:45 Pull the daily returns for WFRPX and run correlations to stocks, bonds, commodities. They are highly levered to bond prices. You think bonds are going to do an AMZN or FB from here?
102 2018-05-16 15:58:01 Hmm... So u r also agree to this.
That ur MLA's are commodities and are up for sale!!
We would also like to know final bidding price for ur deal with @INCIndia !!
103 2018-05-16 15:51:56 .@Robert_Aderholt: The Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission area receives $1.9 billion to promote US agricultural exports, remove barriers to trade, and provide US commodities to those in need overseas through programs like Food for Peace.
104 2018-05-16 15:50:44 Also, even if you include commodities, you'll see they have much higher leverage to bond prices, which is suicidal at this point in the rate cycle.
105 2018-05-16 15:49:09 Pull their daily returns and run correlations to stocks, bonds, commodities. You'll see they have a massive one-way bet on bond prices, which is just plain stupid.
106 2018-05-16 15:48:44 Lies......inflation has declined? As long as fuel price is N145 to a litter prices of commodities and even transportation will always be rising, I wonder where they are getting their data from,mile 2 to Oshodi is now N200 it use to be N80 before the fuel increment

108 2018-05-16 15:48:29 Every single year we facing the same issues with the price increasing in most of the commodities. In a matter of fact it's a arbitrage strategy from these products providers. 

We have two solutions:
1- call consumer protection
2- boycott these hypermarkets or these brand.
109 2018-05-16 15:45:44 @indexshow Really enjoyed your latest podcast examining commodities.  Highly informative.  You discussed USCI as a good fund, but was wondering if XLB would also work as a commodities fund?  Thanks again for all the great info from your show.
110 2018-05-16 15:43:33 Rule no 1. Avoid "illiquid" commodities. Lumber qualifies as one.
111 2018-05-16 15:35:01 A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. #NMKTRCH @lets_NEUROmkt

119 2018-05-16 15:23:16 Sim, e para commodities só dá para *controlar* a demanda...

120 2018-05-16 15:21:55 A really silly tweet Beryl fair play. You do realise that if Wales had control over its own Natural Resources we would be a very wealthy country? Unfortunately, Westminster continues to exploit all of our valuable commodities.
121 2018-05-16 15:21:03  en los próximos años Suecia pretende ser 100% independiente de combustible y ser autosostenible.  ¿A quién le van a vender ese combustible y otos commodities afectados que dejarán de consumir? Esto, en mi mente conspiradora es algo que nos trae problemas.

123 2018-05-16 15:16:22 Did anyone think there would not be a market for US crude oil? You don't have a decades long "ban" on exports of a commodity you don't think anyone would export.  ... I am not shocked that one of the most strategic commodities can find buyers.

126 2018-05-16 15:11:25 Que no es tal. Lo interesante es que la derecha critica endeudamiento (25%), el 2do menor de la OCDE, que fue tomado en plena crisis regional de commodities. Sin embargo no dicen nada del endeudamiento al que llegamos con Piñera 1 (12,8%) en tiempos de bonanza... Propaganda?
127 2018-05-16 15:04:30 Learning how to give constructive feedback and knowing how to take it when you receive one are two of the most understated skills. The first needs empathy and second needs humility - two rare commodities in current times.

135 2018-05-16 14:46:01 They're not alone on this front. A lot of RP practitioners have been stingy with implementing inflation side of RP through commodities exposure.  Tough to get breadth at scale given the liquidity of many of those futures markets. TIPS more common.
136 2018-05-16 14:43:18 Este es un tema de costo oportunidad, quieres meter dinero para ser un país netamente de commodities o un país que genera valor agregado. Por ejemplo. Si tú garantizas el precio de la producción la calidad estaría de más.

157 2018-05-16 13:26:40 Because nobody wants to be tarred with the brush they use so liberally - if you disagree with them, you are an Anti-Semite and a Racist. This is one of the best marketed commodities in recent days
158 2018-05-16 13:23:54 Our repository of market demand data also enables us tell farmers what to grow, the right variety and specifications to guarantee offtake of commodities they produce at fair prices. That's how we help farmers make more money; produce more from less land and sell all they produce.
159 2018-05-16 13:23:42 Risk Parity is a core allocation model that uses futures to get its exposure to equities, bonds, rates, commodities.

176 2018-05-16 12:36:17 That is just not true. You (generously) assume that global corporates extracting & exporting commodities do not structure their businesses optimally. They do. Among other things they minimise profits of vehicles in Aus & generate profits overseas in tax attractive jurisdictions

179 2018-05-16 12:34:07 Congress should be ever grateful to Modi who saved their ass by not bringing out a white paper. Chidamvaram Kevel statistics where expenses were kept off budget, where exports of commodities were shown as 5x of the available in India, where round tripping was called FDI
180 2018-05-16 12:33:53 I used to also look at commodities, gold, bonds, and all world market indexes; but, the last few years with Central Banks intervention (QE, 0 or - interest rates), the correlation among these are just too high.  I gave up, and the entire 2016-2017 "buy and hold" works the best.
181 2018-05-16 12:29:32 We once encountered a scenario where a young girl pointed out that she was denied commodities because of the name 'family planning' yet she had not family. This points towards the need to invest in youth friendly services.

191 2018-05-16 12:08:10 Sim. Na epoca de commodities em baixa ninguém investe nada em novos projetos, e geralmente as empresas ficam alavancadas, com alto endividamento. Essa parte do ciclo quebra as operações menos eficientes, tira oferta, e faz as sobreviventes ajustar custos p > eficiência.

198 2018-05-16 11:42:13 The Federal government's initiative on export of agricultural commodities is yielding results.

199 2018-05-16 11:39:41 The price of commodities is rising. Jeep drivers push for an increase in fare to P10. Personally, mahal ang P10 na pamasahe sa jeep. Paano pa ang mga mas mahihirap?

203 2018-05-16 11:14:41 O cenário começou a mudar a partir de 1929, com os reflexos do crash da Bolsa de Valores de Nova York. A economia mundial passou por uma forte recessão, a demanda internacional por commodities encolheu e o protecionismo passou a ganhar força no cenário internacional.

244 2018-05-16 08:05:33 It's just terrible how they're treated as disposable commodities. The average price of slaves has dropped dramatically since the 19th century.

246 2018-05-16 08:03:04 Media is discussing how much BJP is offering for rebel MLA's from Congress and JDS.Wannabe CM of JDS is making a counter offer 

No one is talking about how MLA' s have become saleable commodities with no ethics & morality

Even a red light area has some ethical code of conduct

#Commodities
248 2018-05-16 07:54:32 A #commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type - that means if we decide for one special commodity we decide for it because of the #brand and not because of the quality of the product. #NMKTRCH @lets_NEUROmkt

Congress spokesperson says we will do anything to protect democracy.

Irony died a million deaths. When people rejected @RahulGandhi yet he adamant to be part of government .
Locking MLA like commodities in a room.

This is what @INCIndia has reduced to.
 
@AmitShah
253 2018-05-16 07:08:47 When Trump was elected the two commodities that rose on the stock exchange were pharmaceuticals and securities. What's going on is shocking
254 2018-05-16 06:58:30 But the national debt is alarming yet you say nothing about it, it is only the turn around in commodities that has recently helped you. I believe now that  you are not good caretakers of our country.
255 2018-05-16 06:56:54 I fully concur with @bkerrow .@KEParliament should legislate on this and stop this senseless destruction of valuable resources.Why not auction cars or commodities where duty is not paid instead of crushing cars or dumping sugar or cereals  in ocean @KRACare ?KENYA BECOMES POORER
256 2018-05-16 06:45:48 Remember that one time during the one great Avengers movie when they allude to Black Widow's past and never ever ever explored her character again, instead making her a board support for the male cast? That's the feminist icon written by a man who sees women as commodities.
257 2018-05-16 06:39:35 Joke of the day. Congress spokesperson says we will do anything to protect democracy.

259 2018-05-16 06:33:58 How do hotels manage to differentiate their rooms when we consumers see them as commodities? The brand and how it’s perceived by customers based on experiences. #NMKTRCH @lets_NEUROmkt

265 2018-05-16 06:13:15 That's simply not taking the MLAs for real. Everyone beleives that they are commodities. We refuse to see the human side of it. One fighting tooth and nail for victory against another on some ideological platform may have reservations to embrace the other.

268 2018-05-16 06:05:04 If you're referring to corruption, the Iranian system is very corrupt. No question. Some money goes to subsidies. Almost every public commodities is subsidied in Iran. Natural gas is almost free. Some goes to infrastructure (not enough). Some goes to defense industries.
269 2018-05-16 05:57:50 IMO, it's important to separate hard commodities and energy. I don't see hard commodities making a comeback, but I could see oil prices continue to rise. I'm long. USD strength will also surely be a factor.

271 2018-05-16 05:34:10 I do believe the risk lies with the investor as this is a commodity as well as bill-&-coin. Govt cant regulate the transactional defines of crypto. Fraud, money laundering, narcotic currency, coin mining & volatility of commodities all need factoring. Traders take $$ for crypto?

280 2018-05-16 04:50:21 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.
281 2018-05-16 04:47:13 Perhaps the Cato Institute would like to comment on the role of High Frequency Trading on the price of those commodities and what volume were traded using those in the 1960s? Perhaps Julian Simon was only correct because of market manipulation and lies called statistics eg GDP
282 2018-05-16 04:27:33 Makes sense. Is there a reason you look at these particular ones, but not commodities or metals or emerging market indices, for example?
283 2018-05-16 04:04:44 Yaani @UKenyatta ,you would dare to impose VAT on Unga and basic commodities, think Kenyans should Demonstrate our disappointment.

285 2018-05-16 03:47:07 Very true, especially among the seniors, disabled, & poor in my area. They've watched healthcare go to private companies who deny a whole lot of procedures, heard about food stamp replacement w/commodities, seen meals on wheels cut, etc. They're fighting 4 their lives.

297 2018-05-16 02:26:07 Depende da cia. A BHP destrói o índice em UK. No Brasil a Vale vai muito bem vs o Ibov. Já a Paranapanema é sofrível. A MMX morreu. Itau é outstanding, enquanto o Sofisa sofre. Difícil definir o tal conjunto de "commodities". Tem commodity producer espetacular, e tem horrível.
298 2018-05-16 02:21:10 Felizmente ou infelizmente, nossa economia tem forte dependência das Commodities. Não tem como dissociar.
299 2018-05-16 02:09:24 Shameless politicians are more like commodities that can be traded.The tweet from Kerala Tourism reflects the tragic rot that has set in Indian politics.Resort politics is the name of the new game & perhaps we should invite Sotheby’s to auction these unscrupulous politicians !
300 2018-05-16 02:07:44 Step 3: Consolidate Circle-tether and make it the only stablecoin pegged only to USD, thus increasing the value of USD as the only fiat through which you buy crypto. Similar to keeping USD value through petrodollar (having to use $ to buy and sell energy and other commodities)
301 2018-05-16 02:07:19 Wow, couple of things. They compare against Bridgewater and AQR without discounting transaction costs and slippage. Secondly they are creating a “Risk Parity” Strategy that doesn’t include exposures to commodities or TIPS which anathema to true RP concept. #InflationKills

307 2018-05-16 01:43:19 Pero si un país liberaliza las importaciones con un patrón de consumo que las hace saltar, se especializa en la producción de commodities, y pretende resolver ese desequilibrio con deuda externa, eso no puede terminar bien. Y no terminó bien.
308 2018-05-16 01:38:03 Why should they reveal? When Indians buy commodities in stores, do they ask shop keepers how they arrive at the prices of those commodities? Are you asking Indian Railways or Bus companies?
309 2018-05-16 01:32:28 If you understood oil commodities, you’d know that the price of gas is dependent on two things: Cost of oil per barrel and availability of refined oil (gasoline).  Gas was high across the country due to two things. The cost oil AND the fires in multiple refineries.

316 2018-05-16 01:09:06 Too broad- the Forex and commodities markets tend more towards the Austrian school and mercantilism and largely reject Kant no matter where they're geographically located.  But when it comes to stock investments, you're largely correct.
317 2018-05-16 01:07:24 Acc. to DTI - the impact of TRAIN law on commodities should be minimal - as in centavos lang. So if there's increase in price of goods, baka hindi dahil sa TRAIN law kundi sa pananamantala ng businessmen. They jack up prices for no reason and use the TRAIN law as alibi.

324 2018-05-16 00:22:47 There are commodities (a chest x-ray). Then there are quests (“we don’t know what’s going on so we must fully investigate”). Commodity costs should be easy. Quests are, by nature, an unknown cost. All prices are opaque because individuals allow insurers to spend on our behalf.
325 2018-05-16 00:18:15 Your ignorance speaks volumes. You might try studing economics and commodities. Come to think about it, that's probably over your head.
