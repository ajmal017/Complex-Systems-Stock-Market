39 2018-04-30 23:56:37 Meanwhile, the complicit corporate US media continues to ignore the horrific slaughter of innocent Palestinians on a daily basis by Israel so that Israel can continue to steal their land, their water, and possibly their oil. US media always sides with Israel.
40 2018-04-30 23:56:37 Profitable oil companies get financial hardship waiver but GOP tries (repeatedly) to cut heating oil assistance program for struggling seniors. 

Because we’d rather help our buddies at ExxonMobil than keep old people from literally freezing to death in their homes.

44 2018-04-30 23:56:05 There is nothing responsible about the dirtiest oil on the planet from the #tarsands.  How about clean technologies instead?  Much more job opportunitues there.
45 2018-04-30 23:55:59 But I watched a documentary that claimed there wasn't anymore oil in Texas. 
46 2018-04-30 23:55:53 Now this is totally unacceptable, we have plenty of Oil and Gasoline. You All Know That This Is The Truth, and it's time to put a STOP To It. All of a sudden the price for oil and gas is going up because of government lies. It is time to put an end to all of these lies to end. – bij American Legion Post 1949

56 2018-04-30 23:55:03 All non-racing Porsches used air cooled 4 cylinder boxer engines up until 1998. Air cooled simply means the engine does not use a radiator with liquid cooling and instead used the oil and louvered cylinder walls to passively dissipate heat.
57 2018-04-30 23:54:44 Nooooooooo! You can barely enjoy the gulf as it is.  The are has not recovered from the BP oil spill.  I heard that oil drilling on land close to the beach has increased.  It's a disaster away from ruining everything worth anything in the gulf. I know what the water samples say.
58 2018-04-30 23:54:41 Canadian oil is no more harmful to the world environment and funds our local way of life.  Claiming it is good for the environment destroys your credibility.

66 2018-04-30 23:53:49 The lawn tractor spit up its oil and quit working.  Hence Katrina’s trip to the auto store for oil.  The new implement dealership in Broadway came and got it.  Hopefully they can get it fixed before the grass engulfs the house.

70 2018-04-30 23:53:24 Thanks. It’s hard to find info about this. Sometimes I want a neutral oil for a salad dressing or frying. Non virgin olive oil performs perfectly, but it is highly processed.
71 2018-04-30 23:53:17 Except it's not even an oil pipeline that we prevented. It would have been for bitumen headed straight to China. Not oil.
72 2018-04-30 23:52:52 Also the sacrifice these people make to afford a better life for their family.  If you don't agree with the oil industry give up your car, phone, hell anything that is petroleum based and see how great the education system is not to mention your life
73 2018-04-30 23:52:51 And don't get me started on the oil industry and the poisoning of natural resources and complete disregard for indigenous sacred sites. I know mothers who have seen oil workers dig up the graves of their own children. The government has no respect for the treaties they've made.
74 2018-04-30 23:52:47 How does It and oil the into this narrative?
75 2018-04-30 23:52:38 Oh, it isn't all the digging, it's all the sucking. Oil and water come out, nothing left behind but air and endlessly patient gravity. Something will inevitably fall in and fill the void. If only Humans didn't suck so much!
76 2018-04-30 23:52:22 instead of  setting up colonies on other planets they should work on saving ours like switching to safe renewable energy like solar and wind and ban GMOs and pesticides  and chemtrails and subsidize healthy organic plants and ban oil pipelines and offshore drilling and fracking

80 2018-04-30 23:52:09 You're being sued for defamation by a porn star.  The EPA just gave an environmental pass to an oil tycoon, and yes you are doing the unthinkable.  Oh and Perry wants us to bail out nuclear and coal companies.  Yup, pissing our money right down your golden toilet.
81 2018-04-30 23:52:06 ain’t never drunk thisbmhch oil before.. idk why I thought today was the day to do that 
82 2018-04-30 23:52:05 against, as are all of the Florida politicians on both sides. no one likes it. the main issue right now is changing the regulations back to pre-BP-spill for the currently existing rigs. oil lobby says they're restrictive. Florida politicians say *EYEROLL*

109 2018-04-30 23:48:23 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
110 2018-04-30 23:48:22 There is a good size oil stain in the DC driveway that says otherwise.
111 2018-04-30 23:48:13 You know what? bite me. Mushrooms taste good have protein. Sure it requires a little bit of work with like marinating with oil and garlic but what doesn't?

122 2018-04-30 23:46:25 In the last half century+ this has not happened, even with hundreds of vessels accessing the existing oil site.  That doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen, but allowing fear to cloud one’s judgement isn’t good either.

127 2018-04-30 23:45:51 This is how the @WhiteHouse runs: The EPA just granted a “financial hardship” waiver for an oil refinery owned by Carl Icahn, a former Trump adviser. Icahn donated $200,000 to Trump’s joint fundraising committee in 2016.
128 2018-04-30 23:45:43 Why do not we give up theire Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and Khood? Oil is all we want. The civilized world, we want the dictatorship.

Finally world sees the regime true color. They lied last 39 yrs & they're good at it. Look how #Zarif lies! To solve the terrorism we have to end #Iran's regime. They have oil, they support terrorists & they won't stop.

135 2018-04-30 23:44:57 Mr. Trump u opened up New oil fields for drilling and got refineries to reopen. ? Why is gas prices still going up?
136 2018-04-30 23:44:56 Just like a man should take pride in knowing how to change the oil or a flat tire....it’d be a shame if his woman knew how & he didn’t...
137 2018-04-30 23:44:55 Indices give up gains and close on the lows as oil adds to gains suffering geo-political tensions.
138 2018-04-30 23:44:55 Also: where will it go? The same people who are against pipelines, oil sands, etc have also pledged to wage war on refinery expansion. DYK one refinery has closed every year in N.A. over past 40 years?

149 2018-04-30 23:43:47 Uh Jen. A president or even the Senate has no control of the gas prices. If you want to blame someone for the high gas prices, then complain to the greedy oil companies. It’s their oil and their greedy businesses who sets the prices.
150 2018-04-30 23:43:46 Congrats. Have you considered taking cannabis oil? Medicinal mushrooms like turkey tail and reishi and shiitake?

154 2018-04-30 23:43:32 I normally go to the dealer. Got a gift card for @DobbsTireAuto so took car there for oil change. Went to pay. Can’t use gift card with promotion. Um isn’t a gift card same as CASH?!? #Dobbs #DobbsTireAuto #fail
155 2018-04-30 23:43:28 Okay!! Thanks for the advice!! They say not to use oil based makeup removers.. what kinda makeup removers did you use? And how often did you have to get them re-...filled?? Lolol dono exact term to use

157 2018-04-30 23:43:13 @RosenforNevada @DeanHeller 
Congresspersons what say you?
Dean Heller voted to confirm Pruitt
Dean ignored Pruitt's ties to big oil
Dean chose to ignore Pruitt's legal actions against the EPA
Dean is ignoring Pruitt's travel, Cone of Silence, acceptance of gifts
Why Dean???

159 2018-04-30 23:42:50 Peppermint oil on the source of the pain!
160 2018-04-30 23:42:45 LOL! Malaysian PM Najib crying to public if opposition wins coming election it will rescind contracts awarded to China causing cheating epitome to stop buying palm oil & birds nest. Con artist China owing trillions to about 71 countries. It's also debt trapping small countries.
161 2018-04-30 23:42:42 Will a water pump pump oil?  I have a rig for my pickup and could have a fun time spraying the fence.  Also, anyone got a 55 gallon drum of cooking oil?
162 2018-04-30 23:42:41 UPDATE didn’t get an oil change or my tires rotated today and I leave for Florida tomorrow. I’m trash.
163 2018-04-30 23:42:34 There is various reasons. If the good people if Scotland can get there head around the fact that we are being treated as sub human by the power's that be. I am not talking about WM it's the war Munger's  and bankers who need the  AAA credit rating from our oil & who  own us.
164 2018-04-30 23:42:31 Bundle like $20 you get the scrub you see. Toner and face oil
165 2018-04-30 23:42:28 Then you need to stay on land cause big yellowfin would be around the oil rigs and those are way out there.
166 2018-04-30 23:42:25 Not legal in SC yet. CBD Oil is, just recently. I’ve added it in to pain regimen, but am still tinkering with the dosage.
167 2018-04-30 23:42:20 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
168 2018-04-30 23:42:09 Interestingly all of western Canada has seen a massive spike in gas prices totally unrelated to carbon pricing. How is that domestic supply working out for us? 

Maybe all those oil and fuel imports out east aren't such a bad thing?
169 2018-04-30 23:42:09 Burning the midnight oil !!!!! Keep fighting the good fight

174 2018-04-30 23:41:28 in desperate need of an oil change
175 2018-04-30 23:41:28 It's soooo goood! A bit of oil and some low sodium soysauce! I do it all the time!
176 2018-04-30 23:41:13 Rent paid. Oil changed. Full tank of gas. Happy Monday
177 2018-04-30 23:41:09 As always, I tend to underprice (at least initially) out of fear of scaring people off :P

...$24 basically covers my materials and an hour labor (spread out over a day or two because a lot of it is "Wait for the dye/glue/water/wax/oil to dry...")
178 2018-04-30 23:41:08 Your right, you ARE doing the unthinkable, to our country and democracy, you’re destroying rights and rule of law, destroying the arctic with oil drilling, letting Pruitt loose on the EPA, giving Carson the opportunity to destroy lives and HUD, but in the end we will stand tall.
179 2018-04-30 23:41:06 Debating if I should take this castor oil or not  I’m kinda scared
180 2018-04-30 23:41:04 Absolutely! But I'll probably mix it with a serum/moisturizer first. I've never tried with oil!
181 2018-04-30 23:40:54 @ABCNEWS, @MSNAustralia ,@bbcworldservice : DEMOCRACY HAS INEFFICIENT OUTCOMES, FUEL PRIZES IN AUSTRALIA ARE HIGH & LEADERS ARE TELLING ITS PEOPLE TO TAKE LITTLE PAIN IN ORDER FOR OIL & GAS CORPORATIONS TO MAKE PROFITS & CREATE MILLIONAIRES WHILE RESOURCES OWNERS ARE TRASHED

187 2018-04-30 23:40:20 Also, isn't there some way that Trump is going to profit off of war in Iran? I mean why did Jared go to spend 4 days with the sultan in Saudi Arabia - & they are speaking out too against Iran? What @ Israel? @Russia? I sense some seriously sinister evil plot. Is it about oil $$$?
188 2018-04-30 23:40:16 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
189 2018-04-30 23:40:03 Nigeria  is one of top 6 oil exporters in world yet 60% + of population lives in absolute poverty! Perhaps a discussion on lowering levels of destitution would be more productive.Trillions of dollars in oil exports and this level of poverty and the focus is on alledged remarks.
190 2018-04-30 23:39:59 Resources are in focus as the deadline for temporary tariff exemptions approaches, and a rally in oil prices, despite a strengthening US dollar, demands attention. @MicMcCarthy_CMC

195 2018-04-30 23:39:17 Alaskans own 835,000 shares of BRIGHTOIL PETROLEUM HOLDINGS L, worth $239,600. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in HONG KONG.
196 2018-04-30 23:39:09 More war has been fought over religion than guns. If you wanna ban something, find causality. Oil comes in second. Ban religion and oil.
197 2018-04-30 23:38:26 do you have a gas engine? do you use any plastic, which comes from oil. Plastic bags, combs, zip-lock baggies. Are you telling us you don't use oil, every day of your life?

199 2018-04-30 23:38:19 Agree. I’ve been saying this all along we need to watch the billionaires, Mercer, Koch, Icahn, etc & Corp in healthcare, oil, pharmaceutical, outsource military & NRA.

We The People outnumber their money but we have to be informed, VOTE and demand Reverse citizens united
200 2018-04-30 23:37:51 Doesn’t Canada lose $50M a day selling oil at a low price to the States? Approve #KinderMorgan!
201 2018-04-30 23:37:37 This. Home charging is so convenient I wouldn't drive 5 minutes out of my way to charge (road trips excluded) even if it were free.  And one other perk: not spending quality time at gas stations or oil change places ;)
202 2018-04-30 23:37:31 Liah, I just recently received the Kale Lalu Yaha! This is my first chemical exfoliator EVER. I’m super excited/ nervous. I was wondering if I could mix the kale lalu yaha with something like hemp seed oil to apply it? @aboutliahyoo 

Thank you !!!!! xx
203 2018-04-30 23:37:18 1) I think I finally broke the code sick = pedophilia.  What does Iran have that EU wants? UNLIMITED supplies of children that won't be missed. EU and their Leadership are trading nuclear technology for Oil / Children. We forget that EU is Hillary & Hillary is EU/Hitler.
204 2018-04-30 23:36:59 I have a friend that uses the gummie bears (from Colorado, and her daughter gets them in Cali) for her fibromyalgia (and she’s a breast cancer survivor) has really helped her...there is also an organic gardening shop at 27th (?) and Penn that has oil
205 2018-04-30 23:36:57 I didnt know Vit C also did that although I need the non acidic gut friendly ver as normal ver inc neat lemon juice gives me a reaction? Also take Thai Basil caps & Nigella seed oil. Been taking Vit C for recommended benefits for collagen in #EDS #HSD + of course immune boost.
206 2018-04-30 23:36:54 US Presidents of both right & left have propped up many scum bags over the years, Shaw of Iran, Castro, Saddam Hussein, and others usually because of economic concerns pressured by big oil and big business. Only to have the turn on the U.S.
207 2018-04-30 23:36:33 Clean the wall with a firehouse and olive oil! This is so sick, they take their flag to the top of the wall, yell, carry signs in their language, disrespect the news reporter. They must not be allowed to overpower our great nation, or this nation will be destroyed!God help us.
208 2018-04-30 23:36:29 With the meniscus tear on my left knee I used anointing oil and prayer it went know keyhole surgery just vpa and singing
209 2018-04-30 23:36:24 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
210 2018-04-30 23:35:59 I’m cold & emotional. All I wanna do is clean & put coconut oil on everything 
211 2018-04-30 23:35:46 So Donny why is the EPA granting a financial hardship waiver to your buddy Carl Icahn the billionaire who own an oil refinery? Blatant Pay-to-Play which you maligned Hillary for! Disgusting ethics once again!
212 2018-04-30 23:35:39 No sir and no oil or butter either
213 2018-04-30 23:35:25 MJ & Pippen. Those two all-time greats were all they needed for star power, because the overall team gelled like the finest motor oil inside
214 2018-04-30 23:35:19 Once missiles start flying between Israel and Iran (hitting Saudi oilfields on the way, no doubt), even $600 oil sounds plausible.
215 2018-04-30 23:35:16 In the 1950s Britain and the USA overthrew the democratically elected president of Iran and installed The oppressive Shah to control their oil and profit greatly.  Then the Shah was overthrown for the current regime, Which was a direct result of UK/USA actions.
216 2018-04-30 23:35:08 Baby oil em' up!
217 2018-04-30 23:34:58 How does a bottle of olive oil, some chicken and some milk cost almost a tenner? In Lidl of all places? Outrageous

223 2018-04-30 23:34:07 Need to drive down the price per barrel of oil. Will further destabilize #IranMullahs and undercut their only big player ally - #Russia.

With due respect, I'm Barrister. Charles Lukas Personal Attorney to Late Engineer Michael a national of your country who was a director of an oil company in Benin Republic west Africa. My client left behind an account valued(US$10,500,000,00)
225 2018-04-30 23:33:58 Don't even try. It would be really nice if we could stop using gas and go to electric vehicles because we can use alternative fuel it's just that big oil kind of owns the country right now. That's where Trump gets a lot of his money, obviously so spare us this rhetoric.
226 2018-04-30 23:33:56 @Jabelz96 bring me home oil and a filter pls
227 2018-04-30 23:33:03 If you put pure coconut oil in your hair, leave it about 20 mins, then shampoo & condition as normal, your hair will be especially silky. It accomplishes the same thing as the expensive products I no longer buy. 
228 2018-04-30 23:33:00 Sometimes comedy is the only way to tell the truth. Do not change the dinner.  It is always different. Remember GWBush looking behind chairs for WMD's? while thousands of Iraquis died in a war for oil?  Michelle was more tasteful than that.
229 2018-04-30 23:32:43 Deja vu going on here, in that it wasn't BC residents that decided to de-commission the refineries that were in Kamloops and Taylor, then sell/ship them to interests in the UAE. Excuse used was they were too small. Refined BC produced oil in BC.

Nothing stops them without the deal. But the sanctions would still be in place not allowing oil exports or investments into the country that is funneled directly towards their military. 

Only benefit from deal is Saudi and isreal are buds

271 2018-04-30 23:26:40 And Trump screwed all of us he's letting oil companies export this oil that's why you pay more for gas  Obama would let them do it that's why are prices were only $2 Trump screwed us again you will be paying 3.00 to $4.00 within the next year this was Trump's gift oil companies

277 2018-04-30 23:25:58 I love the oil analogy! You're right that the physics of the stuff is way different. But crude and data both:
- fractionate
- run in elaborate supply chains
- feed whole industries
- have great R&D
- are transformed in elaborate ways
- create wealth
- should be tightly regulated.
278 2018-04-30 23:25:49 Go peddle your snake oil somewhere else, please.
279 2018-04-30 23:25:47 This plant blowing up made it very inconvenient . Fire marshals are restricted from even stepping inside the oil refinery right now to get the rest of their things .

281 2018-04-30 23:25:30 Hi baby you have an amazing body you are absolutely gorgeous I wish I can rub oil all over your body and kiss every inch of your body with my lips
282 2018-04-30 23:25:21 On the contrary, the job losses were caused by the oil industry itself when it developed the technologies that made tight oil a prospect. The US is now a net exporter (as is Canada) and prices have accordingly dropped thanks to the global supply glut. In such a glut.../2
283 2018-04-30 23:25:21 Legalise #Cannabis and all other drugs. Grow #Hemp for oil based products.

Fixed, no more wars. People with small appendages may then keep their guns.

All because of dirty oil, why not go live off the land free off the boogie man oil? Every time your breathe out you produce C02 polluter!
287 2018-04-30 23:25:13 IF 99% would say bad things don’t you ask yourself WHY?? He is very bad President he has undone ever law to do with environmental protection. Selling our land our oil screw the natives and Mexican who used to live here it was there home.

293 2018-04-30 23:24:26 1/Heat the oven. Gas mark 4. Use a cake baking tray and put a little oil in each cake hole. Enough to cover the bottom and stick in the overn
294 2018-04-30 23:24:25 Everyone with current basic energy knowledge knows why US no longer buy our oil. The discovery of shale gas in America. It's like Philippines president coming to ask PMB why we no longer buy their rice,we already now hv a thriving rice industry.
295 2018-04-30 23:24:16 No.... El U.S Shale oil no iba a desaparecer en 2015.... Pero tampoco es el Santo grial interminable....  Actually, el depletion rate en U.S Shale oil es bestial.... Sino se dan los precios necesarios para que se reactiven inversiones off-shore .....$200 WTI es cuestion de tiempo
296 2018-04-30 23:24:15 For the C.I.A. and oil interests, the 1953 coup was a success. In fact, it served as a model for other covert operations during the Cold War,
297 2018-04-30 23:24:02 So it is not about Human lives it is about selling oil !!! Pathetic !!!

307 2018-04-30 23:22:57  Suckers... Trade Wars and high oil prices due to Trump cancelling the Iran deal will eat through any tax benefit. Not to mention Trump overheating the economy that will drive up interest rates. Like i said before SUCKERS... 
308 2018-04-30 23:22:54 A lot of it's just sorbee lol which is yum, I've also seen a lot of coconut oil based ones since coconuts are so fatty and delicious
309 2018-04-30 23:22:34 Certainly it has nothing to do with Iran having the last top 5 crude oil reserves still not under US/OPEC control (Iraq was the last) or Israel being desperate for war against them for years or Iran being on the short list of "seven countries in five years", Gen. Wesley Clark

320 2018-04-30 23:21:01 The Shah’s government was secular, anti-communist and pro-Western. In exchange for tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid, he returned 80 percent of Iran’s oil reserves to the Americans and the British.
321 2018-04-30 23:20:51 They should be given all those jobs they never had before: garbage collector, oil rig worker, sewage, infantry soldier, construction laborer...
322 2018-04-30 23:20:41 Sad! A country that wants to use agriculture as an alternative to oil will be importing American agricultural products! Hian?

327 2018-04-30 23:20:14 Instead of empowering youth with real job programs, and fighting for a future for the many not the few, the millionaire out of touch Elite Politicians will continue to USE the youth vote to retain power for their war mongering, oil sucking, zionist agenda.
328 2018-04-30 23:20:14 So I take you would rather pay OPECS higher prices and oil supplies manipulations, then drop so low as to SUPPORT the ELECTED president and the REST of AMERICA.

344 2018-04-30 23:17:33 What did Trump say about buying our crude oil ?
All this ur grammar is not necessary, it the IS do not resume buying of our crude oil as they use to.
Your visit is fruitless with seeking oil market for Nigerian crude
345 2018-04-30 23:17:32 If Netanyahu could not spook this oil to a new high...I would seriously start thinking about the possibility of a retrace
346 2018-04-30 23:17:16 OLIVE OIL LMAO JKJK
347 2018-04-30 23:17:06 Don't worry about the Paris carbon tax, hug momma earth thing UNTIL you've got the ECONOMY roaring on all 12 cylinders and give Canadians a few year@ to recoup the losses imposed by Trudebt.
All in good turn but Canada needs r&d, exploration, oil gas etc. $$$ first & foremost! 
348 2018-04-30 23:17:05 Been at #walmart for the past 2 hours waiting on an oil change smh
349 2018-04-30 23:17:03 Gas prices going up this summer...oil prices will be higher than it has in 3 years

351 2018-04-30 23:16:45 Yea! POTUS is finally looking into the Big Oil rip-off of the consumers.
352 2018-04-30 23:16:44 @BMW customer service is trash. Took my car in for an oil change and they are trying to charge me $2,000 for things that are covered under warranty. @Channel4News time to start investigating!!
353 2018-04-30 23:16:44 Fish oil burps are the worst.
354 2018-04-30 23:16:33 It was their money in the first place. US exploited Iran through the Anglo-American Oil Company & the Shah, who James Baker asserted was the worst dictator the US ever supported. Get over fact you had a black president & stop playing dumb-ass politics with other people's lives
355 2018-04-30 23:16:30 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
356 2018-04-30 23:16:29 OIL. Any questions?
357 2018-04-30 23:16:22 Small oil producers are doing God's work, eh?
358 2018-04-30 23:16:19 Our home north of Fairbanks AK we had both windmill & solar. It dropped our electric bill to mere $$'s instead of the huge oil & electric bill both. I wish we could use it now, but when you live even in a small town people would complain about the windmill.
359 2018-04-30 23:16:08 I still can’t believe anybody expects us to believe the people protesting the pipeline would accept a GIANT OIL REFINERY (that would still need the pipeline from Alberta to feed it crude) instead. 

I think we’ve safely moved into the realm of bad faith arguments. Don’t you all?

371 2018-04-30 23:13:47 Sue, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings.     How do u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil. @MikeSmythNews @VictoriaPride
372 2018-04-30 23:13:17 a war in the Middle East. Low oil prices are hurting his economy (as are economic sanctions). War would drive up cost of oil and put him on surer footing
373 2018-04-30 23:13:16 They’re fried in olive oil
374 2018-04-30 23:13:12 The Liberals aren't on track to meet the Paris targets either, largely because of a desire to increase extraction of bitumen from the oil sands and proposing a carbon tax which is too weak and restrictive to be effective.
375 2018-04-30 23:12:56 I’ve been sitting here for FOREVER, waiting on my oil to be changed. But I’ve been talking to the sweetest old man, and just now he asked if I would excuse him for a couple of minutes,and then 10 min later he comes back from whataburger next door and brought me French fries
376 2018-04-30 23:12:55 @realDonaldTrump, Mr President Trump, ur speech praising Buhari is demoralizing to all Biafrans Nigerian in suffering. You've emboldened Buhari to continue killing bcs of trade. Have been promised oil block? You've missed d mark. You miss fired! Trump ur speech killed more pple.
377 2018-04-30 23:12:51 I've been pretty wary of C B D oil (don't wanna get targeted by bots), but on days like this where my anxiety is put into full overdrive over a bad horoscope, it starts to sound like not a bad option.
378 2018-04-30 23:12:36 Open the oil well uncap the oil well get these oil prices down. These prices shouldn't be going up we have an unlimited source of oil the prices are to be going down
379 2018-04-30 23:12:29 1.Cut the chicken into thin pieces

380 2018-04-30 23:12:22 Oh my gosh, I burned my belly with hot boiling oil while I was cooking... it hurts so so so so bad.
381 2018-04-30 23:12:18 Plus I think the current line uses a slightly darker shade than the previous line, so it might take a bit longer for patina/oil darkening to be too evident. We’ll see.
382 2018-04-30 23:12:14 Anybody take black seed oil?

389 2018-04-30 23:11:42 So far I've just been using coconut oil based body butter. I just wanted to know if you had tried anything crazy that I hadn't thought of Haha I'm not sure what to do about the texture other than what you said: accept and love them

414 2018-04-30 23:08:31 coconut oil, burt's bees mama bee belly butter, some kind of Nivea lotion, i've even tried exfoliating. mine aren't real bright in color, but the texture is there. i've just learned to accept and love them
415 2018-04-30 23:08:30 So i have an appointment to get my oil changed at 7, and i asked the guy how long he think it might take and he said he wasn’t sure...i told him i needed it done by 8 so i could get home for the Sixers game. This guy looks at me and says “say no more I’ll make sure of it”
416 2018-04-30 23:08:18 the scent of the oil when he came close, allowing memories to flood through her just at the smell. How gentle he was with moving the coat, and sweeping her hair back. It was sometimes hard to believe that such a gentle touch was capable of (3/8)
417 2018-04-30 23:08:09 K first of all. Wouldnt use olive oil. Smh 
418 2018-04-30 23:08:07 Cod liver oil for the joints 
419 2018-04-30 23:08:06 I have the firm conviction that the decision taken by Iran to use "currency" other than the dollar as regards the sale of oil is the reason for this play. I would add that any agreements between Russia China India to use their own currencies
420 2018-04-30 23:07:50 if any of u ever want silver hair pls know u’ll need gallons of purple shampoo and have to condition ur hair like 3 times + oil it or else ur gonna lose ur hair
421 2018-04-30 23:07:37 sadly I wouldn't mind seeing war in the Middle East to jack up oil prices so people stop buying fucking SUVs
422 2018-04-30 23:07:26 Yeah, it's not hugely difficult tbh. My mum used to like making it with extra virgin olive oil, which was more bitter than I liked as a kid, but beyond that it's just about keeping the bowl anchored while you whisk. Slow pouring is achievable.
423 2018-04-30 23:07:26 3-4 vidalia onions. Sauté them until soft, add a bit of kosher salt, sage, chop up three bunches of spring onions and dump them top with one diced jalapeño. Add olive oil and red wine vinager. Tastes better after it’s had a day to sit and absorb.
424 2018-04-30 23:07:06 they always pretend everyone will be fighting over oil or water when the true currency will be jazz mags

426 2018-04-30 23:06:52 In oil sector? Mr President said he cannot tell America how to spend their money when asked about crude oil. Besides Buhari emphasized more on Agricultural investment. Focus.

431 2018-04-30 23:05:48 Let's say 100k in tech is fair.
Ag/Forestry/Oil/Gas/Mining/Energy account for 345k employed.
Not to mention the ... 1.7M ... employed in manufacturing/industry/construction/transportation that rely on those resources.

Tech is great but the world turns on resources.
432 2018-04-30 23:05:39 Wish somebody would take my car to get a oil change or put some in for me 
433 2018-04-30 23:05:35 This show is ridiculous. Iran is stronger than Saudi Arabia. It sells only oil. It makes it oil. It needs to be begged.
434 2018-04-30 23:05:30 @MayorOfLA Aliso, the only gas storage facility that has crude oil in wells! Crude oil is a mixture of 5K compounds w/ different properties mixing w/ fracked gas from all over US & Toxic SCG proprietary chemicals Creating a Health Crisis in SFV INVESTIGATE SoCalGas,CPUC,AQMD

The nurse stirred the concoction, but by the time she handed it to me, it had separated out, & the orange juice went first. Blech!

515 2018-04-30 22:54:59 O that's the easiest question. it is because Britain is the leading thief imperialist country so one of the major role it has in this world is to steal other countries' threasures, wealth, oil etc..beside it creates reason to do that! @theresa_may
516 2018-04-30 22:54:58 And yet Albertans claim that our high gas prices are because of their oil not being able to be exported en masse on our coastline?

it's all BS. Our economy should be less reliant on oil and gas. Refine and use it in Canada. CANADA FIRST!

527 2018-04-30 22:52:50 France and Germany were benefiting from cheaper oil. How is the recent refinery attack on the U.S. related. Is DAd willingness to partner with Israel due to the oil market? Keep your lamps burning!
528 2018-04-30 22:52:46 Or just get you a Honda. In October it’ll make 4 years since I’ve had my car and I haven’t had any major problems. Normal maintenance such as oil change & tires and I had to get my starter and belt replaced, that’s about it

545 2018-04-30 22:50:19 I have just read a thread about a man with snake oil remedies and some dietary advice for curing HIV\AIDS and cancers. I can't abide it, people have needlessly died believing unfounded claims of charlatans and quack doctors. The conspiracists that support this are complicit too.

550 2018-04-30 22:49:23 The issue is less getting bled out (low casualty count and relatively cheap operation), but they need oil to meet export needs due to domestic limitations, which means being everyone's friend (Kurdistan in Iraq, southern Iraq, Libya, and Iran's reserves matter). Really difficult.

552 2018-04-30 22:49:11 Umm. No they don’t. Every single practicing climate scientist acknowledges AGW. There  are thousands of ideological fanatics who are not trained in the related fields who don’t believe it. Especially oil engineers in Alberta!

554 2018-04-30 22:49:06 @jjhorgan has been crystal clear about the concerns, oil spills, bitumen and our coast. There's not enough supply coming down the #TMX to keep up with demand and they won't expand the line to WA refineries unless they are allowed to expand to Burnaby to sell and ship oil to Asia.

573 2018-04-30 22:45:24 What do you expect from a govt that regularly stands by impotent while a terrorist group kidnaps young girls for the purposes of sex lavery and ransom raising. If it wasn't for oil, no one would talk to them! They are a corrupt state.
574 2018-04-30 22:45:23 And #jhorgan is right - lots of oil, not enough Canadian refineries.

577 2018-04-30 22:44:56 we already pay the highest in gas in California and we get to vote to repeal it.The prices will go down with using our own oil

585 2018-04-30 22:43:56 both tbh. kvd for full coverage and keeping ur oil at bay immediately. fenty for medium to buildable coverage while making you less oily but not in the way that kvd does but it’s fine bc it’s not as heavy if that makes sense
586 2018-04-30 22:43:55 Sometimes you have to oil the wheelsthere’s a dignified exit or there isn’t but it’s normally best if you do the right thing, it can get quite messyeither you make good or you fall. What starts as a snowball can get very much out of control and we all know where that ends up!
587 2018-04-30 22:43:51 @sunriseon7 As always when petrol prices rise, reporting is pathetic. Yes, there has been a small rise in oil prices but it's the gouging that is the problem. Call out the oil companies and retailers.
588 2018-04-30 22:43:47 What’s the salmon oil for?
589 2018-04-30 22:43:41 Of course, this administration wants this to happen. Trump says "America first", but his supporters don't know that that means one thing to him, & another to Americans who will be harmed by his actions. Money for him, oil, & coal, & environmental destruction for t/ rest of us.

594 2018-04-30 22:43:02 Let me ask you..do you drive a car that requires oil? Do you have any plasticd in your home? Any metal? ALL of these products require manufacturing processes that harm the environment and displace/kill animals. I can go on and on..but i doubt you'll get it mr. SJW Vegan.
595 2018-04-30 22:43:02 There's also the Italian mafia doing business with diluted olive oil.
596 2018-04-30 22:42:57 But England is a totally different situation! And the oil that our gasoline comes from is right below our feet! Except governments sold us out so we export oil to be refined and import back at grossly inflated prices!

598 2018-04-30 22:42:31 Over 90% of orangutan habitats have been destroyed in the last 20 years due to unsustainable palm oil production. The orangutan is vital to the existence of the ecosystem because many seeds only germinate after being passed through the gut of an orangutan. #savetheorangutans

601 2018-04-30 22:41:53 Agree with Tro that both non-fruit added HCFS and SFA are implicated in NAFLD. The problem is they track ... diets high in one are often high in the other. But I have patients who are eating lots of SFA even as vegans due to the convenience foods loaded with palm oil.

629 2018-04-30 22:38:28 Why can't they close one - do the maintenance and then close the other one. That way the oil production isn't so limited. Guess a women needs to step in and get that organized. Ahem.

653 2018-04-30 22:35:42 Look it's Oil vs Water. Israel has been an oligarchal nightmare from the beginning, and bought the U.S. long ago to sell "us" an 'American Dream'. All they've given us is a bible, a TV and social media for THEIR dream. They want to replace heterosexuals with transgender. Period.
654 2018-04-30 22:35:33 we won't.  its a veritable tinderbox over there.   Iran vs Israel vs the US.  The Russians are there in Syria as a tripwire.  Its anybody's guess as to on whose side Turkey comes in on.  They are NATO but are now tight with Putin.  China may also decide to move to protect oil

660 2018-04-30 22:35:01 Oil prices moved sharply higher Monday as Israel Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu accused Iran of nuclear deception in a televised address. This follows his meeting over the weekend with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo regarding Iran's nuclear deal.
661 2018-04-30 22:34:45 He raised tariffs on Chinese solar panels to an insane amount, delaying the deployment of clean solar energy in the US, without actually looking at the impact of those tariffs on the solar industry, though that was a boon to the oil companies who don't want solar to take over.

681 2018-04-30 22:31:58 Start with not endorsing snake oil. Homeopathy must be strictly regulated and the people who go to seminars to learn about it shouldn't be allowed to call themselves "doctors".
682 2018-04-30 22:31:55 How many earthquakes has #Iran had in the last 60 days? The mere fact that all his intelligence is 30 years old shows you he is so confident he can bait #Trump & #Putin is in this too! Their greed for #oil shouldn’t be at the price of killing American soldiersSons & daughters
683 2018-04-30 22:31:34 use baby oil and vinegar.
684 2018-04-30 22:31:31 ⠀“ ......it appears that my plan is fucked because I put in Orange oil paint instead.
Welp. ”
685 2018-04-30 22:31:25 I completely missed ole girl selling y'all faux French snake oil getting called out for being anti black AF. 

This is what happens when I try to have a life 
686 2018-04-30 22:31:16 But isn't there also a Genie Gas and Oil tie in there as well? 
Something about Syria something something standing in the way of Genie O&G and ? 
I'd have to check my notes but I am sure that I saw hints that Genie had to do with the *ME pageantry bombing* recently.

Didn't expect to be attacked and ridiculed mercilessly ?
693 2018-04-30 22:29:03 I like chicken and oriental flavors the best, especially if i can get a little sesame seed oil to put in it.
694 2018-04-30 22:28:34 Obviously wanting to scrap the Iran deal and re-impose sanctions is being driven by the Saudis wanting to sell more oil.  Want to help the World economyand stimulate growth? Stick to the deal and watch oil go in the toilet...taking oil stocks with it.
695 2018-04-30 22:28:24 FOR THE ONES WHO GET A COLD SORE ON THE LIP ON A REGULAR BASIS : I GOT ONE THIS MORNING AND I PUT TEA TREE OIL(not with bare fingers) ON IT AND IT IS GONE ALREADY IT DOES HELP!!! 
Idk if y’all knew but I just found out today okay bye
696 2018-04-30 22:28:21 Dawn, Stop spreading nonsense. Zero of your foreign funded eco zealot friends would allow a refinery. Also building a new refinery make zero economic sense. 20 years more of importing Gay killing oil is ok with you?  Guess we won’t see you at Pride. #LGBTQ
697 2018-04-30 22:28:15 As in, cahoots to get rid of Iran so Genie Oil and Gas can make them all billions? Something about Syria also being in the way of the ?
And of course there is Vlad's WDP (World Domination Plan) which relies upon Authoritarian leaders all reporting to him, yes?
698 2018-04-30 22:28:01 how is this not an oil painting
699 2018-04-30 22:28:00 We coconut oil in large cans + recycle them as 'kersene pan' to boil food or scald clothes. #HowCome
700 2018-04-30 22:27:53 Oil glut in the world. We have oil sands. Gas 30cents+ cheaper right over border. What bullshit. You and activist @AJWVictoriaBC are killing the middle class
701 2018-04-30 22:27:46 Super charged Neck Oil. BOOM!
702 2018-04-30 22:27:44 If you sell snake oil, you want people to believe snake oil is beneficial.
703 2018-04-30 22:27:39 By allowing them to leak out of the pipeline with the oil?
704 2018-04-30 22:27:17 GM is out of their damn mind. Went to dealership for my oil change (free lifetime oil changes).
Me "Hey I need new wipers"
Service Rep. "Ok, $17 plus labor, thats $45"
Me "uh nvm I'll do it myself"
Parts Rep "stock wiper blades are $77"
Me "LOL thanks but no thanks"

706 2018-04-30 22:27:04 What is an oil change? What is windshield wiper fluid? What is tire pressure? What is a car?
707 2018-04-30 22:26:57 I traded a guy a 12 pack for a gallon of motorcycle oil. I love the South.
708 2018-04-30 22:26:50 I’ve heard using olive or coconut oil hydrates then and helps with the yellowing
709 2018-04-30 22:26:43 NO nuclear! There is no safe place for radioactive waste which lasts for tens of thousands of years and accidents happen like in Japan where the radioactive several years later is still spilling into the ocean and NO ONE talks about it. That is as bad or worse as oil and gas imo.
710 2018-04-30 22:26:40 Up to today, here's what I have for this week's price changes: Heating/stove oil to increase by 1.1 cents a litre, Diesel fuel shows up by 1.9 cents a litre and Gasoline shows an increase of 1.1 cents a litre. Not as bad as other areas of the country, we should all question why..
711 2018-04-30 22:26:17 Jojoba oil and daily showers. You’ll be reflecting light with your face by mid summer.
712 2018-04-30 22:26:14 A continent like no other... I loved my time there, both work and holidays  I lived there for 3 years. And spent another 4 after, travelling there for work. All the oil hotspots! Life-changing..  You’ll have a fantastic adventure!
713 2018-04-30 22:25:59 rum oil is the most noble part of rum. you can fake esters but you can’t fake rum oil. it is hard to isolate and pre-chromatography there was only the birectifier. WWII and a few other things buried the birectifier before it could become popular, but here we are :)
714 2018-04-30 22:25:47 Oil refinery gets "business hardship" waiver from the EPA. In case anyone forgot, EPA = Environmental Protection Agency.

715 2018-04-30 22:25:39 An oil pen will release all the stress on the second puff! I’m just saying 
716 2018-04-30 22:25:38 Gas  pushing 3.00 a gallon where I’m living. 
This in a country with mass oil stores.
Oh ... and how’s that tax break working for ya?

719 2018-04-30 22:25:19 So you gain nothing w privatization.. except the opportunity for private groups to tailor their curriculum in their best interest.

"Welcome to BP highschool. Global warming is fake and there's never been a large scale oil spill in the ocean. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar"
720 2018-04-30 22:25:18 As you know, getting an oil change takes a while so I took a stroll to find food. I guess all the kids just got out of school. I already know I don’t like kids but like I really don’t like kids. That’s all.
721 2018-04-30 22:25:16 Dry skin? Coconut oil

722 2018-04-30 22:25:15 @realDonaldTrump     Giving back, Donny and Doit Pruitt give a whole new meaning to that phrase!  You two are real winners for your friends, hope you can breathe polluted air, drink oil, eat coal, and swim in polluted water because that’s what your policies are leading too.
723 2018-04-30 22:25:02 It does actually make sense if he’s removing the skin at night and soaking it in some kind of oil bath
724 2018-04-30 22:25:00 Love having a new car until it’s time for that oil change. 
725 2018-04-30 22:24:46 my love for rio mare tuna in olive oil transcends this universe
726 2018-04-30 22:24:33 If you can't vote before the age of 21 then military recruiters shouldn't be preying on high school children and you shouldn't be able to enlist until you're 21.

If they're old enough to die in a proxy war for your oil profits then they're old enough to vote.
727 2018-04-30 22:24:33 And Big Pharma, auto manufacturers, big oil,.... doesn't give money to politicians....  The National "RIFLE" Association is a firearms association!  Who should they get support from, golf club manufacturers, maybe the Hollywood elite who have made their fortune selling violence?
728 2018-04-30 22:24:10 Sen. Roger Thompson now mentions @NextEraEnergyR, an enormous energy company with more than #wind investments in #Oklahoma.

732 2018-04-30 22:23:43 Good to know Toyota is absolutely fucking useless.   Asked for them to do my 90000 maintenance and check out a noise.   And they ignored my phone calls for 3 hours and only did an oil change and tire rotation.  Spent more on gas than I did on the car.
733 2018-04-30 22:23:40 Also there's tons of oil we can start drilling everywhere.
734 2018-04-30 22:23:36 Dear Brown People,

735 2018-04-30 22:23:28 It smelled like they hadn't changed their deep fryer oil since 2004.
736 2018-04-30 22:23:22 Dont listen to him. Washing your face a lot makes your skin produce more oil n you should still moisturize pero w an oil free moisturizer 
737 2018-04-30 22:23:15 Imagine you had to buy car ins for car washes, oil changes, and window tinting. So why all inclusive health ins? Be #selfish and think NO!
738 2018-04-30 22:22:39 Plus no jumping oil casualties..
739 2018-04-30 22:22:39 in theory a fraction 5 could be strong but if fraction 4 was also strong the fusel oil would overrule and be your limiter. you’d want to do whatever you could to reduce it.
740 2018-04-30 22:22:33 Lmao but TRUE or maybe he wants to go loot more of our oil money with our president #Nigeria
741 2018-04-30 22:22:24 I feel like getting on that oil, fuck it
742 2018-04-30 22:22:22 Anyone who ever trusted a Saudi oil king is an complete idiot.
743 2018-04-30 22:22:07 Omg are those bruises or some kind of reaction to the oil? Looks horrible Bebe.

746 2018-04-30 22:21:24 Hear me out... a car is actually a living creature. It needs fuel to run but us bring shitty give it bad fuel so it runs but only for 3000 miles then it needs its stomach pumped or an oil change

751 2018-04-30 22:20:54 Even Israelis themselves don't trust you. Why should other nations? You want the USA mired in wars with your neighbours Syria and Iran. So we're going to need rather more than your word. Mind you, your announcement sent the price of oil up so someone made some money!
752 2018-04-30 22:20:47 NO, don't ruin it for every one else! Did no one tell you that commenting on historical stuff you don't know about is the oil in the twitter wheel?????? How will we ever tweet again??!!

But seriously, write that ish and I'll retweet it 101 times (give or take 100)
753 2018-04-30 22:20:32 Thanksbut any oils are good for the brain - can I be an olive oil mama?
754 2018-04-30 22:20:21 Do your own oil changes?
755 2018-04-30 22:20:12 those are the same rum. fraction 4 is 75% of the fusel oil then fraction 5 determines quality and rum oil appears as well as other long chain stuff.
756 2018-04-30 22:19:54 @KitcoNewsNOW Petro Yuan set to send gold prices into new territory as oil breaks away from the dollar. China to allow Petro Yuan to be cashed in for gold.
757 2018-04-30 22:19:54 Hey if people want to give welfare to foreign nations that hold oil, start a collection basket. I’m sick of having a gun held to my head to feed the world while I bust my ass daily.  My roads are crumbling, my brothers are dying for BS wars and my freedom is being stolen at home
758 2018-04-30 22:19:07 @liberal_party @JustinTrudeau for once in your miserable corrupt careers can you people act like you give a damn about working Canadians and address these gas prices. Let's pretend the oil companies don't own your soul.
759 2018-04-30 22:19:03 The Trump supporters seem to forget that you can draw a straight line in virtually all economic factors from Feb 2009 to today.  Nothing magic happened in Jan 2017..other than 40% of the population became snowed by a racist snake oil salesman.
760 2018-04-30 22:19:03 Yep, we posted before we have Gamblin oil paints.  But did you know we carry, two other brands as well?  Richeson and Royal Talens.
761 2018-04-30 22:19:00 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
762 2018-04-30 22:18:59 How long do you think the line is gonna be at the oil change place? AmAndd why am I airing up my tire at the gas station when they'll just do it for me? 
763 2018-04-30 22:18:59 Fnc is pointing out that restrictions on Iranian oil embargo on exchange for denuking is making cheaper oil avail in Europe and Russia and...China?
764 2018-04-30 22:18:48 Yung kakagising ko lang sabay luto egg tas na todo ko pala ung sa lutuan shet sakit ng oil HAHAHA
765 2018-04-30 22:18:37 The Prime Minister exposed the fangs of the Iranian wolf
#Israel #syria
The deal did not stop Iran, 
they continued nuclear proliferation.
The real money for Iran,
with lifted sanctions, they sell oil, because of the Obama deal,
they are able to fuel the Iranian war machine.
766 2018-04-30 22:18:34 Their midnight meat train varnished by machine oil rammed into their corporate loophole
767 2018-04-30 22:18:14 Some, perhaps including the PM, hold the view that oil and gas jobs are passe. The sooner we lose them, the better. Tech jobs, on the other hand, are the way of the future (and much more fashionable). So, yes, sunny ways for some. Tough beans for others.
768 2018-04-30 22:18:13 ~$100B-$120B of Iranian assets were frozen around the world, <$2B in the U.S. which includes real estate. About $30B of their assests, mostly from their worldwide oil revenues, released. U.S. returned $400M in cash Iran pre-paid for military equip that we sold to someone else
769 2018-04-30 22:18:07 I’d worry less about Scheer & try to explain why AB oil sands get to increase emissions by 30million tonnes while yur enviro minister crows about forcing a tax on Cdns to reduce emissions by 90 million tonnes. Doesn’t seem fair or reasonable. Maybe a reason your plan has no cred.
770 2018-04-30 22:18:01 I almost grabbed the glade that was sitting on the counter to spray my oven pan instead of the canola oil. I would’ve had very aromatic shrimp.

772 2018-04-30 22:17:54 so another politician  on a taxpayer funded vacation..how do they actually get any work done in Nova Scotia..healthcare should be his first priority...and as far as oil then the USA is not the place to be as long as Trump is in charge..he will screw Canada on oil
773 2018-04-30 22:17:53 Ate a banana 
Did yoga 
Prayed 
Talked shit to Putin 
Played with Henna 
Called my doctor 
Took a nap 
Am gonna go hiking
Need one more round of cbd oil today
Need to drink some more water
Need to stay relatively sober
Keep thinking positive 

774 2018-04-30 22:17:52 So Ctaxes will cost $35B per year to reduce emissions by 90M tonnes per year. That works out to $437.5 per year per tonne. Burning a barrel of oil produces 0.43 tonnes of CO2. The Ctax on .43 tonnes is (437.5x.43=) $188. The Ctax on burning oil is 2-3 times the value of the oil.
775 2018-04-30 22:17:39 Charlatan,Snake Oil Salesman.
Rode in on a horse named "Fuck the Poor". Dipped his feet in our drinking water and filled his pockets with our tithes and savings. 
I hope Journalism is held to a higher standard.
776 2018-04-30 22:17:34 Do tell us when Inspectors were there? You allowed Iran to make trade deals with Europe and sell their Oil which is about $68 a barrel  making them millions a month Obama created disasters everywhere,now he's trying to B.S. the Public
777 2018-04-30 22:17:32 I hate the smell of fried food/hot oil....idk why though because everyone knows fried chicken is my fave food
778 2018-04-30 22:17:00 “Take back our country”. Who is in the “our” group?Indigenous ppl? Bec we practiced genocide to steal their land, resources, oil, lumber…
779 2018-04-30 22:16:58 おはようございまいやん〜
780 2018-04-30 22:16:57 Here's a better question; What would the $CDN be worth if the price of oil were back in the $30's or $40's/bbl?  Probably about $0.70 to the USD.  As opposition, The Liberals regularly attacked our oil industry, now they're lucky to have it.
781 2018-04-30 22:16:56 Snake oil salesman
782 2018-04-30 22:16:48 Don't you have anything better to do than posting stupid Tweets?  Go get your hair oil changed!
783 2018-04-30 22:16:38 Ahhh, I know what you mean. I've gone through a lot of sample cases.   Honest Amish oil and beard balm is what I keep going back to.
784 2018-04-30 22:16:33 finally got my oil changed

789 2018-04-30 22:16:07 Perhaps people will move on to talking about coconut sensitivity after all the coconut oil, coconut flour and coconut water that's been forced into patient diets
790 2018-04-30 22:16:06 Oil, all the way!
791 2018-04-30 22:15:51 Correction to a previous post, Oil and Gas have naturally been leaking through naturally occurring seeps over hundreds of millions of years, not a billion years.
792 2018-04-30 22:15:49 The ultimate final best take re Trudeau's Amazon announcement today: "No need to build the pipeline, they'll just package the oil up at their depot and send it to the coast." @filmgoerjuan
793 2018-04-30 22:15:42 Cut the end off, put breadcrumbs in between the leaves, drizzle with olive oil and lemon and bake them in a casserole dish with a little water in the pan
794 2018-04-30 22:15:37 About money spent on wars and welfare to other countries i agree, but if you notice the nations list you provided in another thread, it seems like the higher "sponsorizations" go to countries with a lot of oil or near them, so i could state it's for national interests at end.

797 2018-04-30 22:15:32 in the tales it may be different because fusel oil is also present. those floating precipates are interesting and they were in 6,7, and 8 of the 24 year jamaica rum.

801 2018-04-30 22:14:54 I wouldn't put that much importance on the oil price. The Soviet government lost as much money from its anti-drinking campaign (tax losses from vodka sales) as it did from oil.

806 2018-04-30 22:14:19 There's no heating and dads refusing to buy more oil because 'it will get warmer in a couple weeks' yeah aight,  in the meantime we'll all just die of fucking hypothermia dw xx

813 2018-04-30 22:13:46 O, there is an oil and it never pops off

816 2018-04-30 22:13:41 So gas price hikes totally void any tax credit for working folk, while oil companies report $BILLION$ profits and tax cuts! Thanks for nothing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends and those drug price cuts you promised?

818 2018-04-30 22:13:30 cooking with palm oil worse than poison gas i swear 
819 2018-04-30 22:13:22 I just don’t understand the difference between this and a pan. Oil washes right off you just need it to cool
820 2018-04-30 22:13:17 Its going to be disastrous if the crude oil reaches this price.
821 2018-04-30 22:13:05 Take away the debt punch bowl and the rise in production  (at least in US tight oil) becomes a mirage.
822 2018-04-30 22:12:48 That’s just the beginning. Same things going to happen when trump claims victory that US is the #1 exporter of coal/oil.. other countries are going to laugh in our face and ask how we were so dumb not to move away from using natural resources & invest in solar power / tech
823 2018-04-30 22:12:48 Bullets equal profit, the US has no humanity just propaganda. Until all Americans wake up to the fact you don't live in the land of the free, you are owned and controlled by your media, the illusion "you come in peace", "control the oil" only to discover later you died for a lie!
824 2018-04-30 22:12:41 Come let me rub bio oil on your stretch marks x
825 2018-04-30 22:12:39 What I need, what I really need to get better, is about 2 weeks in Azerbaijan in the crude oil baths, and a whole lot more financial stability than I have right now. I wish I could reliably import the Baku crude.
826 2018-04-30 22:12:28 Danica...I can't even right now. I'm getting an oil change and the mechanics are starting at me now because I burst out laughing.

829 2018-04-30 22:12:18 Just how are farmers getting grain to market if trains are carrying oil?
830 2018-04-30 22:12:15 I predict trip;e digit oil by fall
831 2018-04-30 22:12:11 Ummm. So by your logic, a carbon tax would actually lower the cost of everyday necessities because we would push oil and gas investment away from Canada?
832 2018-04-30 22:11:54 In need of a new oil cartridge? Oleum is 10% OFF today! Get in here!!
833 2018-04-30 22:11:43 Actually, even the middle east is using sea water injections in their oil fields because the pressure has diminished so much, due to amount of holes drilled. Conventional oil is long long gone!
834 2018-04-30 22:11:33 Our previous prime minister was in bed with oil companies.  Hinged our whole economy on it, suppressed anything that might have went against them.
835 2018-04-30 22:11:32 Are you pretending there aren't 2 oil tankers in Vancouver harbour right now? Seven more in US waters and 1 in Juan de Fuca...
836 2018-04-30 22:11:21 I still have blank canvases and oil paints. I love painting with oil paints. I’m a huge fan of Bob Ross!  I wish he were still with us!  I don’t have much time to these days, so I focus on music which comes much easier to me. My painting buddy Alexis passed away....

847 2018-04-30 22:09:53 Why? He has nothing to do with it.. these are events that unfolded during the Olympics.. not because of Donald trump.. that’s like me saying I deserve a billion dollars because I live in Texas and know of oil fields.
848 2018-04-30 22:09:48 They are not going elsewhere, with shale oil production in US recovering over 90% of the reserve they are self sufficient but are we? 
I think if we can fix our power sector and transport infrastructure other things will just come naturally.
849 2018-04-30 22:09:44 @lewitt: "right now the most important you need to understand is that interest rates and oil prices are rising – period full stop. You can crow about earnings until the cows come home but the raw material of markets – money – is getting more expensive."

852 2018-04-30 22:09:10 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
853 2018-04-30 22:08:58 I am pleased with your compliance to Labour law providing HMO for your staff. May Power oil continue to compete favourably unlike Emperor
854 2018-04-30 22:08:50 Referring to oil/gas nonsense.

Re BP that was competitive pricing, you can see prices charged at the station advertised and can shop around. Compare that to the forced 12 cent then 10 cent excise on petrol pushing up inflation, interest rates, cost of living.
855 2018-04-30 22:08:10 mais bi oil c juste magique
856 2018-04-30 22:08:09 Took my car in for an oil change, left having to tow it somewhere else because the fuel pump died.  Sometimes life sucks.
857 2018-04-30 22:08:04 Is it possible for the Senate President to snap with all corps members present on the camp? as much as he could, he snapped with some corpers, I can confirm to you that he knows none of those corpers he snapped with
858 2018-04-30 22:08:02 No it's collusion and monopoly by the oil companies to produce less and artificially inflate the prices, check the dividends to stock holders, don't see that going down at all.. So do us a favour "John I didn't win an Election" and temporarily stop collecting the tax for now !!!
859 2018-04-30 22:07:59 I really don’t know where to start with you Flat Earther Gloria Warming nutjobs. When you stop using anything made from fossil fuels, including fire, come back and talk to me. Oh and be sure to be naked as even the cotton underwear, or hemp, is made from a machine that used  oil.
860 2018-04-30 22:07:55 India’s appetite for crude oil is leveling off, with imports lower so far this year. For the first 29 days of April 2018 they imported 3.97m bpd down from 4.05m bpd in April 2017.  
Weird, oil lobbyists said India would lead growth in global oil demand. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯#cdnpoli #bcpoli
861 2018-04-30 22:07:50 There is absolutely no proven market for dilbit. Is that what you would like to hear? None. Oil prices are dropping, KM played you, and this is not a sustainable industry.
862 2018-04-30 22:07:41 We ran pipelines and corporations keep extracting oil from Public federal lands and we have to pay more! Who made this "Fleece America Again" Policy?
863 2018-04-30 22:07:35 a bit more oil and time on the sunbed and your body will be ready to eat. xxxx
864 2018-04-30 22:07:25 Are you as vociferous in your objection to the nearly 800,000 barrels of OPEC oil we import every year? If so Energy East could have used your support.   There’s a domestic market we could have tapped, but once again transportation becomes the issue as it would be with gasoline
865 2018-04-30 22:07:23 Tried CBD oil for the first time via @AJA_Cortes recommendation and discount code.

I loved it.

Went to reorder today, but @SabaiDeeCBD  Good Vibes is sold out.

Probably because everyone loves it.

Ordered a cheaper brand from Amazon today. Hopefully it's good stuff too.

869 2018-04-30 22:06:56 Pretty smart bit overall. The antijokes and the trump being poor stuff was $.  These red hat chuckleheads will vote to bomb a brown county for oil any day of the week...then call you unpleasant.
870 2018-04-30 22:06:46 Is now an achievement 4 Nigeria president to met US president...Hmmm
For ur information the visit was fruitless, nothing serious came out it.
In fact ur husband could not even as the Trump why the US no longer buy our oil as they use to.

880 2018-04-30 22:05:28 I like to sprinle nori with different flavors of popcorn seasoning. A very short hit of sprayed oil can help the flavoring stick. I do this to a couple of nori sheets and then cut them about 5 x 5, makes about 50 seaweed chips for 20 cal give or take
881 2018-04-30 22:05:26 That’s not technically oil
882 2018-04-30 22:05:21 Sorry, but Middle East is the only one that is conventional, but you can go ahead and get your oil from that area. Go support that garbage over there. Look up the definition of Conventional, I don't think you understand what that means. Venezuela is also very heavy oil!
883 2018-04-30 22:05:19 It's that amazing unatural phenomenon as deployed by our unbiased, straight down the middle main stream media whereby the price of oil is only reported when it is low.
884 2018-04-30 22:05:15 The @maui_moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil conditioner has so much slip. I didn’t remember it being so easy to detangle with this but it makes me wanna try other conditioners!
885 2018-04-30 22:05:05 Amazon will soon announce new delivery method from Vancouver dist center, carrier pidgeons. Their champion Trudeau will have shut down oil biz by then. Sure their will be a poop problem but we’re already there.

887 2018-04-30 22:04:46 Just pointing out that CBD oil was probably a bad example.  Not aurguing with you.  I don’t want folks to think it’s illegal.  I sell it.
888 2018-04-30 22:04:40 For orchid growers whose plants get fungus, there's an excellent organic fungicide safe for kids and pets, SNS 244, made of thyme oil, smells, but very effective. Saved my Phal. violacea, spray all parts of plant above soil if on leaves, use weekly for 3 wks. Problem solved.
889 2018-04-30 22:04:30 Hmm yes I think the account claiming this is full of BS as having read through the also claim oil links to the uk Ireland amongst others.
890 2018-04-30 22:04:23 I made chili this weekend and I used grape tomatoes that I roasted on a cookie sheet with the garlic and onion and a bit of olive oil/salt/pepper at 400F for an hour before blitzing with a food processor and adding to the pot A+++ would recommend
891 2018-04-30 22:04:20 I told my parents I’ve been using castor oil to make my eye lashes stronger and they laughed in my face bc apparently it was used as a laxative? Ok cool
892 2018-04-30 22:04:13 $GM has negative free cash flow, which will only get worse as $TSLA expands production, rates rise, and oil prices surge.

Best to look at two segments separately:

Previously cash cow, but now dead, ICE

vs.

Emerging, and future cash cow, EV

Who’s the leader of the future?
893 2018-04-30 22:04:10 Ford is only going to be making gas guzzlers again going forward. And oil prices are on the rise. Good luck with that. #MAGA
894 2018-04-30 22:04:03 Ugh why won’t these places just tell me the price of an oil change 
895 2018-04-30 22:03:52 Texas buys our crude product. They refine it, and sell it back to us. Do you understand?

We are saying that Canada should NOT buy refined oil from Texas, but instead refine it here, and ship it to be used by Canadians. 

This is not hard.
896 2018-04-30 22:03:24 I’m actually going to jiffy lube now to get an oil change!!

902 2018-04-30 22:02:41 I ended up crossing a bridge I didn’t want to cross and running over a cone in the parking lot just tryna get an oil change so this is an interesting night

MN voters might've been burned over frankengate but they still deserve a reliable D vote for their altruistic values.
907 2018-04-30 22:02:24 I wonder where all this oil and gas development is. There hasn’t been a new permit issued in or around #Moab or #GrandCounty for a few years. You guys don’t do much research.
908 2018-04-30 22:02:17 I agree but it’s hard to do when so many jobs are linked to carbon. Oil companies need to become energy companies and invest, govt has to provide incentives, workers have to retrain and consumers must adapt. Asking a lot of all.
909 2018-04-30 22:02:17 Do he got oil cartridges for the low???
910 2018-04-30 22:02:12 I like it.

914 2018-04-30 22:01:50 @PnPCBC McKenna says carbon tax will reduce emissions by 90 million tonnes. But for every two tonnes of reduction via carbon taxing consumers McKenna’s permitting AB’s oil sands producers to emit an additional tonne. A nonsensical two steps forward one step back Liberal plan.
915 2018-04-30 22:01:47 You know what? Maybe we should be helping Iran. 
1. They're religious 
2. They've got oil

918 2018-04-30 22:01:35 @PnPCBC McKenna says plan to price carbon will reduce emissions by 90m tonnes. Great! Except she fails to point out that while we pay that tax to lower emissions, she’s ok w AB oil sector increasing emissions by 30 million tonnes. It’s a 2 step forward 1 step back Liberal plan.

923 2018-04-30 22:01:05 This article was a veiled story about the oil and gas sector. None of the evidence backed the premise. And fossil fuels are not the future so we really should broaden our horizons.
924 2018-04-30 22:00:55 They choose to because they don’t want to keep subsidizing oil companies and pretending manufacturing jobs that went to robots are coming “back.”
925 2018-04-30 22:00:54 I don't think it was anything sinister of weird...Wagner mercs are hired guns, professionally trained shock troops and security guards.  They were probably hired on by the Iranians for big money to assist the local tribes in attempting to take the oil fields.  Who knows though.

941 2018-04-30 21:58:42 When I heard this, I almost died laughing. Nigeria is so corrupt only an atom bomb would wipe it out. We are only there bc - you guessed it - OIL.
942 2018-04-30 21:58:40 Imagine how or countries feel about us being in there country... Stealing their oil and resources.
943 2018-04-30 21:58:23 Mike, your short-sightedness is showing. We have the demand, in Canada, for our own refined oil. Keep the exports where they are, and the rest stays in Canada, to be refined by Canadians, to be used by Canadians. We currently buy our own exported oil back at exuberant prices.

950 2018-04-30 21:57:54 How about this question. “What is the impact to the oil industry if winter is e.g. shorter by a week and most drilling in northern AB can only occur when the ground is frozen?” Is that important to AB?

970 2018-04-30 21:55:09 Huge icebergs could be towed from Antarctica to Africa -   just fill up oil tankers (many idle)... with glacier river waters.  Anchor offshore ..pump into water systems. Filters clean water etc.  Easy peezie.. no need for tugs.
971 2018-04-30 21:55:07 Cook with Avocado Oil if you can. Better than olive oil & it trounces canola, sunflower oil & all other unhealthy oils. #BetterWayToSlim

975 2018-04-30 21:54:35 We regularly change our cars oil every 300 miles on one and 5000 on the other, improves the mpg and only go to locations that publish how they recycle the oil. #GreenFelix @hotelfelix
976 2018-04-30 21:54:33 Look at all the products they make. They own the oil that makes them, too.

Say even 5M ppl boycott ALL spending, incl. saving gas, w/out suffering at all. (Contact media abt it!)

Then more begin. They feel it big time in a week. Prepare to go for months.
Buy local, no chains.
977 2018-04-30 21:54:02 And the reason Venezuela is in the state that it is today is not because of socialism, it’s because of the decrease of oil prices, which the Venezuelan economy is heavily dependent on. It has experienced similar economic troubles under the neoliberal governments of the 70s, 80s

985 2018-04-30 21:53:00 Did you see the price of gas lately?  Your tax "cut" will be going to the big oil companies back pockets.  Corporations make profit for shareholders.  They don't make jobs.  The jobs go wherever its most profitable to place them.
986 2018-04-30 21:52:51 It won't be helping supermarket plastic reduction targets by 2025. Let's not even go into the palm oil discussion...

991 2018-04-30 21:51:59 No, what he was doing was liberating Libya from the grips of the US and the IMF. He was implementing social safety net with his oil profits. He was making sure that children went to state funded schools and that his people had healthcare. That’s what he was doing.

1000 2018-04-30 21:50:50 what did olive oil ever do to deserve this hate
1001 2018-04-30 21:50:45 Trump's lack of comments on @IsraeliPM @netanyahu press conference on Iran NUCLEAR LIES speaks volumes.

Watch oil futures. They will be the early sign.

1004 2018-04-30 21:50:11 With oil prices climbing & bimbo Bogus Boy doing nothing we’ll see how much the tax cut will help. A lot a things made from oil- like plastic. A lot of items will go up in price & inflation happens the cut ain’t worth the paper it’s written on.
1005 2018-04-30 21:50:10 Why am I ranting about olive oil
1006 2018-04-30 21:49:58 All love when I say this fella's plz learn that all oil/colognes aren't for all seasons/occasions
1007 2018-04-30 21:49:48 idk why an oil change takes over an hour.. I’m ready to go.
1008 2018-04-30 21:49:38 why i'm mad today: recipes are always lying about how many "steps" something has. saying "dice the chicken, coat it in flour, put two tablespoons canola oil in a skillet, turn heat to medium, brown chicken for 10 minutes" is NOT one step. that's at least FOUR steps.
1009 2018-04-30 21:49:30 Read comics.

1015 2018-04-30 21:48:40 Today I made the horrific discovery that the 1 calorie a spray oil I had been buying was just normal oil in a spray and not some magical low fat oil. It’s 3 times the price for 1/3 the quantity. You’re just paying for the container basically. I feel duped.
1016 2018-04-30 21:48:39 Congratulations on us sinking not  further. Also congratulations to petroleum market for higher oil and gas prices.
1017 2018-04-30 21:48:38 I’ve been waiting ALL week for my @ColourPopCo highlighter to come in so I can put some in my palmers coconut oil. Thank you @iluvsarahii 
1018 2018-04-30 21:48:31 Not true sir. The @HMKemiAdeosun says specifically that Nigeria is not looking to rising oil prices but looking to continuing the diversification of the economy * that the FGN will continue to reduce waste of resources, pursue accountability, increase in tax income etc

1023 2018-04-30 21:47:49 Well those 2 things are what killed it. Indigenization of businesses should have happened naturally, not from a policy from the government. I think they never imagined the Oil boom would end. With its end came a natural drop in production due to the exodus of foreign owned biz

1028 2018-04-30 21:47:23 Someone suggested cbd oil and now I knock out forreal the moment I hit any mattress.
1029 2018-04-30 21:47:04 Haha I'm noticing that. I mean why invest in the technology industry? After all, it's not like we will need it when the oil industry goes under and we have to quickly catch up to green energy technologies.

1032 2018-04-30 21:46:48 @Budget your Cordova, TN location is crap.  Gave us a car w/oil light on, check engine light on, & fluid light on.  We had to drive across town to exchange it, PLUS fill it up with gas.
1033 2018-04-30 21:46:41 I want to massage loads oil onto your sexy Sexy body Hun but I’d never want to stop

1035 2018-04-30 21:46:30 Re read my post again. Did I say Haiti did discover oil or they could?
1036 2018-04-30 21:46:22 One more point: It's not that the Soviet Union *couldn't* have adjusted to an oil shock. They were able to adjust to Hitler! It's that they were politically incapable of adjusting, for the same reasons that Greece couldn't internally adjust, except a million times worse.
1037 2018-04-30 21:46:13 Really what Sen Marty Quinn is saying is he has raised taxes on the energy sector through the roof!  OIL, Gas, and Wind all lose with Sen Quinn in the Senate. #okleg

China’s new oil futures contract is gaining some momentum as a fixture on the global oil market, although hurdles remain before it can become a key benchmark for Asia.
1041 2018-04-30 21:45:34 There is no more "conventional oil" NONE! Those days are long long gone! Everything involves tight formations and frac, EVERYTHING. Next if you hit oil, you will have gas, and that gas, if not economical burnt off, over and over again.
1042 2018-04-30 21:45:30 Quick question: how would building a pipeline to sell oil overseas, push gas prices at the pump down in Canada? I am missing the logic behind these posts. Seems like just people ranting about the high price of fuel.

The difference couldn't be clearer. Nationalized oil led Norway to a trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund.

Privatized oil led us to a trillion dollars in national debt (with at least some of that money spent subsidizing oil!)

1065 2018-04-30 21:42:58 @jasonfenske13 Hello! I love your channel. Is there a way to clean the piston rings by adding something to the oil or into the spark plug housings? Actually, should be possible I think
1066 2018-04-30 21:42:51 facilities to remove the solvents, make the bitumen balls (ideally in AB) and refineries to convert the balls into usable oil & gas at sites of use, east and west, so they can provide energy domestically instead of relying on imports of refined products.
1067 2018-04-30 21:42:23 Every time I get an oil change those guys just add a million more things to what I “need”
1068 2018-04-30 21:42:23 Better also understand what a disposal well is or an injection well is. Tell me about the environment there. Also, you should just take out the whole mining, oil, forestry industry while you are at it. Industries that push economies!

1080 2018-04-30 21:41:13 Now you're talking about tribes; they're not even sects. It doesn't matter what such Arabs think, if indeed they do. That's just the oil talking let the oil run out, they'll be begging south Asians to be their friends. Arabs are lazy, south Asians are industrious in comparison.

1083 2018-04-30 21:41:09 I'd prefer to see the oil provincialized, actually. The best government is local government.

I disagree that we should be treating aboriginals differently based strictly on their race, as that is how race-based caste systems such as what we have, in effect, come about.
1084 2018-04-30 21:40:50 I'm talking Buhari. He isn't just saying, he's asking for weapons. Will see

1088 2018-04-30 21:40:22 Your hair doesn’t feel dry because it is over producing oil since you wash it too much; which is why yours must feel so nasty after one day

he saves oil workers &countless others on his travels
he chose earth after they give him up to Zod
he takes a life for the first time in his life to save a family &humanity itself

just admit youre a shameless mcmarvel shill
1093 2018-04-30 21:40:03 They don’t look short, but the guys who change my oil always have the seat pulled all the way forward 
1094 2018-04-30 21:39:55 Trump does not have the power to end the JCPOA agreement between Iran and six world powers.. Also the May 12th deadline is just a review of American sanctions of Iran oil exports in dollars..hardly significant in terms of the deal.the #OOTT morons are clueless:)
1095 2018-04-30 21:39:40 we all know when El Trumpo issues alternative facts, a depressed snail has brainfreeze #impeach
1096 2018-04-30 21:39:34 Dont get overboard. Numbers are about $1000 per resident. That pays for some. Would be willing to pay $2 a liter if that money would go towards cleaning up. Agree that shale is as much dirty but conventional oil rigs not as dirty ops. Methane from settling ponds are terrible

1098 2018-04-30 21:39:24 At Heartland Toyota getting an oil change 
1099 2018-04-30 21:39:20 Oh yeah dumpster fires are cool but I prefer the 55 gallon oil drum method, start a fire in it and keep throwing me peanuts so I can roast them roasted peanuts are delicious
1100 2018-04-30 21:38:55 So your job requirement of travel is ok but ppl who need to drive for their job is not acceptable to you? Alberta is O&G and agriculture and the world is demanding oil and we have it so why not be successful with our natural resources?
1101 2018-04-30 21:38:54 Lost a court case forcing the EPA to grant a financial hardship waiver to this oil refinery?
1102 2018-04-30 21:38:37 I’m only 200 miles past my oil change this time. I’m getting better
1103 2018-04-30 21:38:32 Snake oil.
1104 2018-04-30 21:38:29 The problem with oil is a 1-2% oversupply and the industry is crippled for years. Less than 10% EV car (not incl trucks etc) penetration would make this happen. It won’t happen in the next year or two but within the next 5 is the sweet spot to be invested in oil. I’ll stick to Li

1106 2018-04-30 21:38:15 Pardon my French, but most of the wave of "esports clothing" I've seen thus far looks like snake oil salesmanship to me? 

Most of it looks great, but "this hoodie/sneaker/pair of boxers will improve your Elo" is such a boosted statement, even for PR.
1107 2018-04-30 21:37:45 I read (Economist) that he also believes that oil companies are price gouging, in addition to turnarounds in the refineries and of course supply and demand due to increased driving in Spring and Summer.
1108 2018-04-30 21:37:43 Really?? Have you forgotten the revenue garnered from Scotland's oil?
1109 2018-04-30 21:37:40 Schocking,  Absolutely Schocking! Imagine, men like trump and Pruitt lack integrity and rule of law being bribed by a billionaire oil man. My, my!
1110 2018-04-30 21:37:39 Guys crude oil prices closed at $68.57 a barrel today - that’s good news for U.S. Markets and the Economy @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer @RaymondDAlfonso 
1111 2018-04-30 21:36:51 Illegal crude oil refining at fault. Unfortunately, security agents collect bribes frm the culprits so theres no one to arrest the situation
1112 2018-04-30 21:36:38 Nope. I found quite a few places that are hiring. My last tweet is almost incorrect. The short buildings with the small firms seem to be hiring. A renewable energy corp, 4 oil services corps, 2 general engineering consultant corps, and a healthcare tech firm.
1113 2018-04-30 21:36:23 #RDSB exdiv 33.51p per share Thursday 10th May and very near All Time High at 2613p. AGM 22nd May. If oil stays up this could easily breakout of ATH.

1115 2018-04-30 21:36:07 Bl*ck m*n are on one today. I’m going back to my oil of oregano pills and Dolly Parton coloring book.
1116 2018-04-30 21:35:52 And we deserve it
1117 2018-04-30 21:35:49 Instead of using ground nut oil

So tragic!
1118 2018-04-30 21:35:47 I Agree with you Jessica.  Why should Canada be exporting crude oil   just to buy it back when refined.  To whose benefit? PM Justine Trudue  should think about this seriously.
1119 2018-04-30 21:35:40 New Deal:Obliterate ALL Iran military facilities. Then afterwards, inspect them to see if they are nuke free. (Include those in Iraq,Lebanon,etc.) Then Saudi Arabia military administer the new "Territory of Iran" and France administer Iranian oil assets.
1120 2018-04-30 21:35:37 Lol d sun is no child's place
1121 2018-04-30 21:35:34 Yes I'm certain this is completely authentic and there is no ulterior motives for oil and war profits, yeah right. Lead by example and denuclearize! Join with UK and USA and lead by example!
1122 2018-04-30 21:35:29 Has Kris Kobach volunteered to pour boiling oil on the caravan..yet??? It's something Kobach would enjoy.Why aren't the rubes at the borders to protect us from these few destitute children and families seeking a better life?
1123 2018-04-30 21:35:18 The U.S. EPA (Pruitt) has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, exempting the Oklahoma facility from requirements under a federal biofuels law, saving millions
1124 2018-04-30 21:35:07 Crude oil prices highest level in 3 years. Thanks #MAGA.  What’s good good for the goose...
1125 2018-04-30 21:34:49 I’m not a prop for the oil companies. However, I tire of govts continuously finding ways to tax us. We live in a sub arctic climate 6 months of the year. I dont feel I should be taxed to heat my house or when I have to drive an hour for groceries
1126 2018-04-30 21:34:43 “That man smell like Kinta oil” 
1127 2018-04-30 21:34:40 Ouuuu I been hearing a lot of good things about tea tree oil for the face lately, I'll look into it
1128 2018-04-30 21:34:37 "conventional oil" Does not exist in NA. Understand that! This kind of garbage ticks me off. Bunch of ppl with opinions about nothing. No real understanding of how things really work, but they see a picture!
1129 2018-04-30 21:34:36 price? oil or water color?
1130 2018-04-30 21:34:34 Yeah, whatever feelings any of us have towards our nations of birth, I don’t think any of us feels anything warm towards oil companies, foreign or domestic.
1131 2018-04-30 21:34:22 Oil
1132 2018-04-30 21:34:15 Happy Birthday to me! Kicked off the festivities by burning myself on a hot pan, followed by 6 hours of restless sleep, and when I got up to make a hot beverage, I spilled the kettle! Looking forward to the next big event, maybe an oil fire?
1133 2018-04-30 21:34:06 Where the bloody hell have you been when oil was US $30 bucks per barrel. Last fricken yr . And we were still paying GFC prices . You should have been writing articles and asking bill who  exactly he was chiseling money from .
1134 2018-04-30 21:33:49 i want to be in Puta Cana soaked in tanning oil with a drink in both hands
1135 2018-04-30 21:33:45 Does anyone noticed that Buhari told Trump he doesn't need the U.S to buy Nigeria's oil because Nigeria already has other buyers? SMH!
1136 2018-04-30 21:33:34 Yeah, I have never been so confident in a holding despite having 3x more than any previous holding. Can sleep easy at night knowing the only surprises should be to the upside! Lots of drivers to come with the oil price as the bonus that could super size the returns......
1137 2018-04-30 21:33:25 KOCH to-do list if they want more KOCH$$ support, includes, not limited to:

KOCH made reminder call to 'em re ACA
Santorum wants to be back in the game
1138 2018-04-30 21:33:20 well, you remember what that oil paid for in your Province. Hospital, roads, schools, etc. Also, know the facts. Complete BS. Educate yourself how your "conventional" oil is drilled, frac'd & brought to market. # of truck loads of sand, & cubic yards of fresh water! #knowthefacts
1139 2018-04-30 21:33:15 UPDATE: I still don't have a beard trimmer. Paralysis by analysis.

The growth is completely untamed, I look homeless, you would know if you're on snapkat/instagrizzle. 

So I applied a beard oil today. It was a sample sachet I got from somewhere and I just wanted a tamed beard.
1140 2018-04-30 21:33:12 There goes your tax cuts!  Straight into the oil companies' pockets.  You can't tell me that wasn't planned.
1141 2018-04-30 21:33:10 Clark actually wanted to be Superman ever since he was a teenager; it's in his nature to help people even at the cost of his well-being such as abandoning his job to save the oil rig workers or humbling himself in front of the government.
1142 2018-04-30 21:32:55 Yes, he [Putin] wants to control the gas & oil coming out of #MiddleEast. Complete with military bases in the East Mediterranean. 

This could effectively turn #Russia & #Putin into world superpower, if he succeeded. But that’s not going to happen 
1143 2018-04-30 21:32:32 Damn, I just know it don’t take this damn long for a oil change 
1144 2018-04-30 21:32:24 He wants socialized oil refining?
1145 2018-04-30 21:32:14 Here they have pre loaded "cartridges" for some vape hardware as well as just vape oil. They also have the disposable "e-cig".  I get one and keep it in my purse for emergencies.
1146 2018-04-30 21:32:05 Coconut oil for me
1147 2018-04-30 21:31:58 This excuse was never a factor when fuel was .65/ltr here and oil was +$100 a barrel. That wasn’t even 13 years ago. The cad $ was .89 US
1148 2018-04-30 21:31:57 I just discovered that I'm in love with oil painting.
1149 2018-04-30 21:31:53 Mills, yes, but not the oil palm producers or whether the oil palm is responsibly produced. This was the equivalent of disclosing smelters/refiners. Good, but not ground-breaking.
1150 2018-04-30 21:31:50 I absolutely love my ceramic pans! If I need a little lubricant I use half a teaspoon of virgin coconut oil...delish!
1151 2018-04-30 21:31:46 Republicans in the WH. Gas will keep going up so that oil companies can get richer.
1152 2018-04-30 21:31:29 let me draw u like one of my French girls bb OOOOMPH  (no but forreal someone should be out here making oil paintings out of ur nudes pls get on this make that coinnnnnnnnn )

1159 2018-04-30 21:30:43 I personally know several soldiers who undoubtedly have PTSD but won’t seek treatment because they fear it will affect their career & think there’s a stigma.

1173 2018-04-30 21:29:16 This administration is so blatantly corrupt and evil- like a super villain's in charge of the WH. Who golfs 1/3 of the time. Give hardship wavers to oil co's.

1183 2018-04-30 21:27:58 Price to demand signal is usually pretty mediocre until you hit outer ranges of prices. A 40% oil price drop 2014-2016 was only responsible for 1-2% increase in consumption, according to EIA (and my faulty memory). $0.17 is a drop in the bucket in CA.
1184 2018-04-30 21:27:53 Neem oil it works , excellent oil

1192 2018-04-30 21:27:13 Stop wasting money on expensive products for your skincare routine bc tea tree oil is literally all you need, settles acne scaring and literally gets rid of any spot you can feel coming straight away (and helps reduce oily skin if you have it) IT SAVES LIVES

1195 2018-04-30 21:26:57 The us produces also u know that. From the golf and shale. Would be glad to buy oil from alberta from conventional oil fields. Not from the dirty tard oil business unless they clean their act with methane and co2 emissions
1196 2018-04-30 21:26:37 Tax cut. Really!!  Lost it to oil/gas prices. Nice going DT. Use reserves to cut prices. Hi ya forgot u want the oil companies to get rich u hypocritical sob. For the ppl my ass
1197 2018-04-30 21:26:35 Man feeling accomplished today changed the oil and oil filter in my car, also changed my cabin filter! I refuse to pay someone when I can do it myself!
1198 2018-04-30 21:26:29 We are dead. RT @Maybeks: Buhari said he can't force America to buy our crude oil but he signed a trade deal to import America agricultural produce that has no economic value to our country, local farmers and fragile agricultural sector.

1208 2018-04-30 21:25:35 As a result, UN sanctions were lifted on 16 January 2016:$29 billion or ~one third of Iran's foreign held reserves. The removal of sanctions against exports of Iranian oil. ... Allow Iran to trade with the rest of the world and use the global banking system such as SWIFT.
1209 2018-04-30 21:25:20 I need a new oil diffuser. Mine got the lil dick 100ml tank 
1210 2018-04-30 21:25:13 Your just trying to manipulate oil stocks to go up with empty talks. Old Wallstreet trick i believe it's illegal in the states
1211 2018-04-30 21:25:13 Try Jetty. they dont burn the oil and they stay charged forever. Pens arent too expensive either
1212 2018-04-30 21:25:08 Wow I tried this coconut oil and lemon juice mixture on my twist out yesterday because my scalp was hella drusnd flaky AND THAT SHIT WORKED
1213 2018-04-30 21:25:03 Pretty straight forward, been heavily reported. Our "friends" Russia & Saudi Arabia decided together to slash production & eat up the world oil glut. US gas prices are up 18% on the year will rise far higher.
1214 2018-04-30 21:24:58 7 big sisters of oil: Chevron, Exxon, BP, Shell, Total, ENI and Statoil will do 80 to 90% of the global long cycle development.
1215 2018-04-30 21:24:53 Of course Trump wants to sanction Iran. Oil prices will rise and that’s good for Russia.
1216 2018-04-30 21:24:52 vicks on my feet and chest and olbas oil on my pillow, surely I will sleep tonight 
1217 2018-04-30 21:24:46 Yes if there would be peace but a war that would close the Persian Gulf and control the oil would save it
1218 2018-04-30 21:24:42 Does this include all parts of Marijuana such as CBD oil? Commonly used for anxiety.
1219 2018-04-30 21:24:39 Current gasoline prices in the Lower Mainland have absolutely nothing to do with opposition to the @TransMtn pipeline. There is no evidence linking the two items. People saying otherwise are either spreading #fakenews to support the TMX or are being paid by big oil to lie!
1220 2018-04-30 21:24:26 Now that the oil field is picking up I have so much paperwork. My L-shaped desk is so full of invoices that I had to move to our 6 person dining room table 
1221 2018-04-30 21:24:23 I got my oil changed & tires rotated first thing this morning and then got in a car accident 3 hours later so today has been counterproductive
1222 2018-04-30 21:24:20 Hope the trays work well.  l like the addition of the oil to the engineer’s tray 
1223 2018-04-30 21:24:17 I dont know why some of you are so shook that some of eat rice with ketchup. Its for when you dont have stew for your rice and you have ketchup handy.. add your oil and your chilli powder. Posh garau garau!
1224 2018-04-30 21:24:16 My Pandora track is titled "Translation": all instrumental because lyrics mess up my vibe. Can I use my essential oil diffuser instead? (Some shouldn't run with scissors, I shouldn't be around open flames.)
1225 2018-04-30 21:23:39 Never know what you'll find when you move a mountain. Freedom? Knowledge? Oil? Boiling hot lava?
1226 2018-04-30 21:23:37 you can't reason with progs.  they intend to stop oil production and shipment. they will keep peoples hope alive with their lies while undermining the progress of the projects.
1227 2018-04-30 21:23:37 So Netanyahu pours oil on the mid east flames with his flipchart. US says they know; no new info there, but it softens the world for a strike. Obvious the Zionists currently in charge of Israel see peace as a toxic concept.
1228 2018-04-30 21:23:35 NOBODY DEY

1230 2018-04-30 21:23:18 I understand your skin goes through a natural peeling process after being sunburnt but I literally cannot deal. I feel like I’m sprinkling the Earth with the remains of my dead skin like its salt.

I’ve tried aloe, tea tree oil, oil with lemon seed extract & Vitamin E.

AYUDAME.
1231 2018-04-30 21:23:00 I just drank a glass of wine and ate some fresh strawberries. Then I took the longest, hottest, nicest shower, singing to myself the whole time. When I finally forced myself out the shower, I drenched myself in coconut oil. I feel amazing.
1232 2018-04-30 21:22:41 Indigenization Policy Effect, Post Yom Kippur War, Post Oil Boom.
1233 2018-04-30 21:22:25 Let’s hope.
1234 2018-04-30 21:22:19 And NO carbon tax on imported Oil and you seem ok with that, hope you’re not another stooge of the East!
1235 2018-04-30 21:22:04 @KevinLee23 If this screen were to be implemented, do you think @IndyCar would allow an extra person over the wall during pit stops to remove tyre rubber/oil/general rubbish from it? @AndersKrohn
1236 2018-04-30 21:22:00 I always feel like a little piece of popcorn after I pour tanning oil all over myself and bake in the sun all day
1237 2018-04-30 21:21:50 I'm guessing some massage oil was in said basket.
1238 2018-04-30 21:21:47 I go out and people are like “ommgggg Chlo you’re glowing” thanks it’s the oil 
1239 2018-04-30 21:21:39 Who?? You of course. Butt oil seller! Where is your snake oil shop?
1240 2018-04-30 21:21:20 I’m hypnotised by this like I was when Rihanna was rubbing oil into her shoulder 
1241 2018-04-30 21:21:20 Oil?
1242 2018-04-30 21:21:12 While Trump & Pruitt would sacrifice the entire planet for their oil & gas friends, it is essential that Congress stop them and take active steps in protecting our ocean resources, clean air & water, and soil/land needed for food growth.
1243 2018-04-30 21:21:10 After This Oil Change I’m Finna Fuck This 24 Up 
1244 2018-04-30 21:21:00 I really really wonder what’s been happening behind the scenes out of earshot of any press. Putin supplies oil to NK, China supplies other needs to NK & Pompeo meets secretly with NK. I think they all win (and IQ45 wants a Noble Prize so what the heck) but the citizens all lose.
1245 2018-04-30 21:20:47 Pretty sure they wax plus all that oil some of them rub on themselves probably keeps it soft lol.
1246 2018-04-30 21:20:38 Just doing an oil change, a supercharger is too much
1247 2018-04-30 21:20:34 You see results with that? I keep seeing that, teabags, and almond oil.
1248 2018-04-30 21:20:30 He might "end the deal" for May the 12th, but begin a process of negotiations that prevents damage to Iran's oil industry. Either way, the #OOTTmoron s are wrong (again). If for some reason Iran oil supply gets taken off the market, I'm sure Russia or SA will make that up.
1249 2018-04-30 21:20:28 3. US will not be buying Nigeria oil, President Buhari said he can't ask US to buy our oil because "you can't tell US what to do" 

4. Donald Trump said the main reason for calling the meeting is to ensure US has a better trade deal with Nigeria.

1251 2018-04-30 21:20:21 i have to get an oil change but i really just want to lay in bed for the rest of the day.

1253 2018-04-30 21:20:10 Sorry Genie oil.
1254 2018-04-30 21:19:56 Thanks for walking through hell with me:) I need stronger cbd oil, to quit smoking, spend more on food, talk to my doctors, maybe go back to the pulmonologist, see a neurologist & budget my money better. But you feel so helpless sometimes. Also I really wanna get stoned. 
1255 2018-04-30 21:19:53 Seve is getting his first oil change since I’ve had him. 
1256 2018-04-30 21:19:50 it’s just tesco’s free from one! if u can’t get that one you can just make your own with bread butter/oil and chopped up garlic!

1259 2018-04-30 21:19:38 I’m waiting for my car’s oil to get changed, and this man is CLIPPING HIS FINGERNAILS. HELP. ME.
1260 2018-04-30 21:19:31 Mr President don't need to market our fluctuating oil to U.S because we've diversified not only is the determinant of our dear economy. We have better things to market to America.
1261 2018-04-30 21:19:01 honestly you can just buy like a cheap vape pen and get thc oil and put that in there

1266 2018-04-30 21:18:24 Hey @KINDSnacks is the palm oil in your Kind minis sustainably sourced? Got a free sample today, but not trying to kill any orangutans. LMK!
1267 2018-04-30 21:18:07 Do I have to use unrefined oil?
1268 2018-04-30 21:17:38 PMB gave a very good response to that question. He emphasised the fact that our focus isn't just on oil.
1269 2018-04-30 21:17:35 Snoop dogs G pen line is the best for flower, oil is a different story tho
1270 2018-04-30 21:17:34 Oil companies or just oil companies that belong to Trump’s friends? (Trump doesn’t actually have friends. Every Trump relationship is financial.) Either way, despicable.
#TrumpsSwamp
1271 2018-04-30 21:17:33 Thorburn & Griffiths would have ended up owing Bazza money after their wages had been docked following the midnight oil burner in 83. It's a daft idea.
1272 2018-04-30 21:17:23 Will be burning the midnight oil playing catch up on a lost day of work. Suggest/send me links to your favourite Sudanese Qur'an recitations to soothe me through. Please and Thanks 
1273 2018-04-30 21:17:18 Lmao I'm gonna die here for an hour just because my car needed an oil change and inspection.
1274 2018-04-30 21:17:17 Lmfaooooooooooo guy I go soon block you..  I be oil blog worker?
1275 2018-04-30 21:17:15 OIL & RESSOURCES ...!!!

1277 2018-04-30 21:17:07 I smell like an old lady bc this airwick oil thing spilt on my at work and now I’m all itchy and i have a migraine from the smell. Fml.
1278 2018-04-30 21:16:59 My son is irked he sitting in the shop with me... sorry son our car needs a oil change 
1279 2018-04-30 21:16:58 Facts and Trumpers mix like oil and water.
1280 2018-04-30 21:16:52 Just finished that hoe ass 10 hour course for work now im boutta go pick up a new oil cartridge n get dummy high
1281 2018-04-30 21:16:44 American sawmills running 24hrs a day and our oil is shipped out then sold back to us in the form of gasoline....
1282 2018-04-30 21:16:42 What Parliament has is the power to decide the snake oil salesmen who conned them into embarking on the project in the first place should explain how their promises will be realised or to cancel the project before more money is wasted. It’s sovereign so has the power.
1283 2018-04-30 21:16:22 fish oil pills stink
1284 2018-04-30 21:16:14 America has been an oil, pharmaceutical, insurance and banking company with an army for many years.

Breath smells like Coconut Water 
1287 2018-04-30 21:16:12 Super thankful for chase and kassie they took my car to get the oil changed and cleaned it out and washed it 
1288 2018-04-30 21:16:05 It's a Shame on the Nigerian leader who suppose to protect our small industries and the non oil producing sector of the economy(especially the  agric sector)
1289 2018-04-30 21:16:03 I didn’t realize we were debating loggers? I don’t think a faller is the same as a fisher. So there are variables based on expertise (however that’s attained) and risk of course. But I don’t think that’s a blanket rule for all jobs in the oil field.
1290 2018-04-30 21:15:55 And what gives your colonialistic imperialistic govs the right to interfere in other countries business? Well I give you the answer, because of oil...
1291 2018-04-30 21:15:50 lavender oil is truly a god send
1292 2018-04-30 21:15:46 Buhari said he can't force America to buy our crude oil but he signed a trade deal to import America agricultural produce that has no economic value to our country, local farmers and fragile agricultural sector.

1293 2018-04-30 21:15:40 I’m so thankful that the State blessed us with these cars. I would be livid if I had to drive my whip to these other counties. FOH. I just got my oil changed and tires rotated too. I’ll take that key playa. Thanks.
1294 2018-04-30 21:15:30 Too faced born this way. V full coverage and lasts forever (and I have oily skin) 
Bb cream w a lot of coverage is the complexion rescue by bareminerals and I wear this all day w minimal oil.
1295 2018-04-30 21:15:05 I thought this idea was investigated by the Arabic countries decades ago and it was found to be too expensive for them. So if the oil tycoons could not aford it, how could this ever be feasible for Cape Town?
1296 2018-04-30 21:14:59 Congratulations to Wilma De Voe for receiving  Best in the Show award last weekend with her beautiful "Lotus Flowers" oil painting.

1298 2018-04-30 21:14:43 When you really like facial oils bc you have dry skin and you discover a nice jasmin oil from Chanel but it's $120...HA HA HA 
1299 2018-04-30 21:14:40 Project Amad, the secret nuclear weapon scheme of Iran was exposed by Isreali Mossad

The JCPOA will ultimately be scrapped because of Netanyahu presentation. Serious conflict in the region.

Oil will definitely be affected

How will Nig prepare for such occurrence?
1300 2018-04-30 21:14:34 It's a useful insight if you want to map geopolitical influence over oil prices. Shale producers dominate at about $60, but below that, low cost producers like Saudi are influential. Saudi decision to raise production easy to understand in that light.
1301 2018-04-30 21:14:29 And oil and coal lobbies!
1302 2018-04-30 21:14:14 No way. SA proven reserves will last 80 years, unless they find new fields. The world will stop burning oil long before Saudi wells will run dry.
1303 2018-04-30 21:14:05 i can’t wait till cars run on freaking vegetable oil so i don’t have to sell a body part every time i need to fill up
1304 2018-04-30 21:14:03 The United States Armed forces is quite simply a mercenary force used by Israel and Oil Cartel to fight proxy wars, while billing the American public in taxpayers dollars, for these disastrous interventions. We're 21 trillion dollars in debt!!!!!!! When is it going to stop?
1305 2018-04-30 21:13:55 Gas prices are higher than they've ever been since I started driving. Can someone tell the oil companies we can't afford their prices when we're #brokecollegekids?

1309 2018-04-30 21:13:17 One of the advantages to using beard oil is that in a pinch I can always grease a pan or whatever.
1310 2018-04-30 21:13:14 And now we are back to nationalism. Unless we go to war. And then we will "keep the oil" as trump suggested we shd have done after Iraq War & 'may get another chance'.
Nationalism at its finest.

1316 2018-04-30 21:12:08 Put dat coconut oil on my bald head and dat bitch gleaming like the pearly gates
1317 2018-04-30 21:11:47 Doesn’t believe @BlondeLegcnd would crush on Kaiba. Those two are water and oil. But his reaction to the rumour never fails to entertain the hell out of her. Cue the quiet snickering.
1318 2018-04-30 21:11:43 Actually, peak oil theory stands up perfectly well if, instead of oil, you bracket oil by production cost. So $10 oil, $20 oil and $30 oil are all past peak. But as cost bracket goes up, so total reserves rise rapidly.
1319 2018-04-30 21:11:36 I'm not carribean I'm not a slave still  have my surname I'm not white. Keep stealing crude oil
1320 2018-04-30 21:11:30 Just stick with the oil change

1322 2018-04-30 21:11:22 We don't want your stinking oil!
1323 2018-04-30 21:11:09 Now I'm no oil painting but if you look like that cunt you want to be going with an hairstyle that doesn't look to attract attention. If I was the barber I wouldn't have let him have that. Like when the tattooist won't let you have 'SHARON IS A CUNT' on your back.

1333 2018-04-30 21:09:57 Saying that independent countries in the middle east had full autonomy control of their resources is farce. Neo colonialism was and still is a huge issue, the British still owned the rights to drill for oil, and use the Suez canal, just as the Belgians owned the mines in the ROTC
1334 2018-04-30 21:09:54 That was the most important other"half". We freed their frozen assets.Of course trump,who maintained wealth by lying,fraud & theft,considers that a terrible deal. He also said "We shoulda' kept the oil" in reference to Iraq War. And "Who knows,maybe we will" if we go back to war.
1335 2018-04-30 21:09:51 You know what's in Northern Syria, oil, that's why Israel has claimed the northern Syrian Golan Heights. Get oil is drilling there now. Cheney's a board member.
1336 2018-04-30 21:09:40 More like stupidity & narcissism! Has no clue how much he is not even remotely qualified for this job! He sold himself well, like a Snake Oil Salesman!

1343 2018-04-30 21:08:38 Isn't there a strong argument for cutting heavy oil (includes California's) and tar sands first due to added CO2 produced in refining process?
1344 2018-04-30 21:08:29 Yep, the ale is a problem, esp if you drink socially. I have big salads at lunchtime w/ (say) smoked salmon, but I dress it with lemon juice, a little olive oil & a squirt of balsamic glaze - which is quite sweet and you only need a small drizzle of it to get some decent flavour.
1345 2018-04-30 21:08:27 Are you Putin us on? Apparently the Iran deal is bad for Russian oil exports. Is that right?
1346 2018-04-30 21:08:09 You obviously no nothing about football. Literally the best run Spurs have ever been on competing against Oil money and Russian gas money clubs. Literally half the England national team is Spurs. Stop being 12 for a moment
1347 2018-04-30 21:08:00 coconut oil to shine these waves.
1348 2018-04-30 21:07:58 I usually have to coat them in oil to choke them down haha
1349 2018-04-30 21:07:49 Gas should be $2.14 a gallon - oil was $140 = 4.40 gas $75 oil now gas sB 2.14 what’s going on .
1350 2018-04-30 21:07:48 Love our Brooklea Olive Oil!  Look forward to picking up some salt. :)
1351 2018-04-30 21:07:31 I need to get a oil change and get my tires rotated.
1352 2018-04-30 21:07:11 You're going to make Nigeria pay for it yeah? Take their oil?
1353 2018-04-30 21:06:59 Tomatoes on bread exist, in Spain they run a line of Olive oil, rub w/garlic , then rub 1/2 Tomatoe on it. I forgot name. Spaniards got tomatoes from their Mexican invasion.
1354 2018-04-30 21:06:45 Mike is lying again everyone- using a map of distribution pipelines that heat people’s homes and imply they are for oil. This is the environmental mafia at its absolute worst. #cdnpoli #ableg
1355 2018-04-30 21:06:38 It's slow  needs the oil change on it
1356 2018-04-30 21:06:38 Yes I tweeted that very topic to rick Francona yesterday. We are ginning up a war w Iran for Israel’s security . Prob want Iran oil for our oil development companies (Halliburton etc) again
1357 2018-04-30 21:06:36 ouch. Good anti-inflammatories (like turmeric, fish oil), massage, rest...just owie.

But our old man fail to ask the important questions ....just siting there & YES SIR
1361 2018-04-30 21:06:19 Best oil filters in the business!
1362 2018-04-30 21:06:12 sorry dan u have to drink motor oil or you’ll be kicked out of the place :/
1363 2018-04-30 21:06:11 A lot of state employees live in and around Jackson. All of them are getting their oil changed today.
1364 2018-04-30 21:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1365 2018-04-30 21:06:06 Which goes to show, that oil $$ doesn't benefit the people of the states that it dirties. Only the owners...
1366 2018-04-30 21:06:05 Chop red and green peppers, an onion sliced razor thin, some garlic and black pepper. Saute in jusr a wee bit of oil to get it started. When it's all nicely softened, make indents and break an egg into the indents. If you're well stocked, put a bit of sumac on top.
1367 2018-04-30 21:06:00 Politicans get made fun of and cry, then take our kids education,Medicare for elderly,and send our kids to fight for oil and land, then live in mansions and work 165 days at best, I think this nothing, they should be roasted every day 1 by 1.
1368 2018-04-30 21:06:00 MEN ONLY DRINK OIL
1369 2018-04-30 21:05:58 This girl just learned how to change her own car oil!  cannot wait for my mans to teach me more. 
1370 2018-04-30 21:05:56 if the mens doesnt have engine oil in it i dont want it
1371 2018-04-30 21:05:45 “Anoint my head with oil” indeed.
1372 2018-04-30 21:05:42 Very interesting. The article says (if i read correctly) hemp based is best. *The Peace love and pitbulls* guy on youtube "cannabis oil saved my dog" video he s saying for an illness (cancer) to def use thc based cbd and for things like arthritis can use hemp based. Thoughts?
1373 2018-04-30 21:05:41 NOOOOO
1374 2018-04-30 21:05:39 Totes. The barge that spilled that oil on the north coast plus the 29000 litres spilled a few weeks earlier in Alberta won’t clean itself up. Keep those new jobs coming. Let’s NEVER look into creating renewable energy jobs.
1375 2018-04-30 21:05:29 Awwwww /)//(\ I love that dog I would love that. Afternoon: it's so sunny! I see too many of these oil memes.

1377 2018-04-30 21:05:10 Between 1944 and 1991? 

Let's see the worlds largest superpowers competing for the largest supply of oil known to man, the isreal Arab conflict, the Syrian coup, the souz canal crisis

Quite a lot actually.
1378 2018-04-30 21:05:03 Yup - Oil n junk in jet-pipe ---> NOX, SO2, CO2 and particulates.
1379 2018-04-30 21:05:00 oil and ozone. My dentist is a naturopath and she also advocates the use of ozone. She did give me a tip and said that when I brush before I go to bed, NOT to rinse, just spit and let the ozone have its way with my gums. :-) I like that.
1380 2018-04-30 21:04:40 He smells like expired motor oil.
1381 2018-04-30 21:04:38 United States Oil Fund (USO) price at close, 2018-04-30, is 13.8.
1382 2018-04-30 21:04:33 I've been putting baby oil on my eyes to help but god they are so fucking itchy. I can't believe how bad that moisturizer fucked my eyes up lol
1383 2018-04-30 21:04:25 I wash my face with Garnier's SkinActive 3 in 1 once i wake up, then i use Garnier's light face wash, After that i use Areej's rose water and natural moisturizer but it's okay to skip the natural moisturizer step, Step 5, i use Nuxe's multi-purpose dry oil. And that's all pretty
1384 2018-04-30 21:04:16 @RXBAR SO STOKED to find a bar w/o palm oil!!! You’re literally one of two brands I found w/o it!! Please urge @KelloggsUS to make this a company-wide policy!!
1385 2018-04-30 21:04:09 You made it!!!  after complaining about the sun. God has done it for you   
1386 2018-04-30 21:03:59 CAN February GDP expected to be 2.8%. If so, must be oil. If so, March will be better. Nobody loves the greasy stuff but it's a $ maker!
1387 2018-04-30 21:03:45 Oil
Brent crude rose by US53 cents or 0.7% to US$75.17 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US47 cents or 0.7% to US$68.57 a barrel.

1388 2018-04-30 21:03:35 @BestFoods so sad to see your new ad and then check the ingredients on the sunflower and avocado mayo's. As long as they have estrogenating soy and canola #GMO oils in them, the healthier demographic you're aiming at would never buy it.  Maybe try Avocado w/Sunflower Oil or EVOO?
1389 2018-04-30 21:03:27 Ummm...I just put Young Living Lime+ oil in my Ningxia and bubbly water...it might be the smartest thing I've done in a long time. The end.
1390 2018-04-30 21:03:21 What kinda oil is good for your hair besides coconut oil?
1391 2018-04-30 21:03:05 My dog ate an entire bottle of CBD oil. Brand new bottle. I paid $40 for that shit. 
1392 2018-04-30 21:02:57 Osheey oil man .. drop the cash

1396 2018-04-30 21:02:28 That feeling when its hair washing and shaving day and you just bathed in coconut oil 
1397 2018-04-30 21:02:23 True. Iran should change its hate Israel rhetoric,and negotiate peace. Iran should never get nuclear weapons,but when is Israel giving up its atomic weapons? But why were 2 secular anti-jihadi nations- Iraq and Syria destroyed after Sep 11? Oil security for west and Israel lobby!
1398 2018-04-30 21:02:07 April 30, 2018 at 05:02PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1403 2018-04-30 21:01:37 Those trump resorts are pricey too i hear, looks a lot like payola...didnt the arabs (big oil) just book whole floors of trump properties? Didnt trumps family sell green cards as perks to millionaire chinese when they bought kushner condos?
1404 2018-04-30 21:01:27 Complete and utter snake oil.
1405 2018-04-30 21:01:24 Oil that wall!

1409 2018-04-30 21:00:50 with the price of a barrel of oil on its way through the roof again(artificially) can $4/gal for gas be far behind?? THX @GOP @realDonaldTrump Middle class and Poor fucked over again!!  while Bills and Mills get massive tax cut #Bernie2020
1410 2018-04-30 21:00:44 That's obvious,  the whole mess was America wanting oil! Just like Syria, claim it's acting for kids and human rights, but forget about Yemen or people in Saudi. Wars are fought on greed not need

1412 2018-04-30 21:00:27 I see my question was not clear. Hair products that focus on squeaky clean or thicken or reduce oil buildup and lack essential oils are typically not marketed to blacks. So it could be said those are ‘black’ hair products.
1413 2018-04-30 21:00:14 It was actually Saudi Arabia responding to OPEC countries cheating on their quotas by mass-dumping a ton of oil onto the market in the early 80's. This triggered a balance of payments crisis for the Soviets, they start taking massive loans from the west, etc.
1414 2018-04-30 21:00:10 The blue whales are large mammals  in danger of extinction because they're captured for food, oil and many more products, also the contamination and chemicals are product of a large percentage of deaths in whales

1416 2018-04-30 21:00:04 My dog follows me around trying to lick the coconut oil off of my skin because he loves the taste and I’m like excuse me how dare you interfere with my skin moisturizing routine
1417 2018-04-30 21:00:04 This is the flim-flam high-end version. The REAL Man Box contains heavily used scraps of leather, loose crude oil, and chest hair
1418 2018-04-30 20:59:47 The Baltics, Uzbekistan and Belarus are about the only former Soviet Republics doing well
And Uzbekistan only managed to do so through having one of the larger oil and gas reserves
Ukraine has been in a horrible economic state since independence. With worse corruption than Russia
1419 2018-04-30 20:59:44 $GM cash burn = mostly maintenance CapEx

$TSLA cash burn = mostly growth CapEx

The former is drifting into unsustainable losses, while the latter is growing into sustainable profits, while oil prices are surging. Place your bets accordingly.
1420 2018-04-30 20:59:41 I love when it’s time for an oil change. The guy who services my car is fineeeee 
1421 2018-04-30 20:59:15 How does Norway have a 1Trillion Dollar Oil Fund & Scotland has Food banks ?

For the May Wag Box, would y’all like a “welcome summer” box with a ball of some kind, bug essential oil spray, chew treat, cookie and bag of treats?
1424 2018-04-30 20:58:54 Nice...my ridiculously high bank charges and interest rates could be part of a bail out for the Canadian oil and gas industry and Canadian economy. Maybe this is part of the plan where the deficit will take care of itself. Interesting times we are in. Thx John
1425 2018-04-30 20:58:49 I’ve got some vitamin e oil
1426 2018-04-30 20:58:45 The British and Americans signed the Anglo American oil agreement in 1944 after the British and French split the area up in 1918 to try and control most of the areas and their resources.

The interesting thing about history is it tends to be continuous and interconnected a lot.
1427 2018-04-30 20:58:39 I use peppermint tea, ginger if feeling sick, otherwise rest and quiet, sorry but I try not to do pills and medicines so wouldn't know if any of those work. Also try lavender oil if you have a burner. Hope it goes way soon.
1428 2018-04-30 20:58:30 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1429 2018-04-30 20:58:23 In 1997 the oil burner he installed (after he was caught for the gas) low down at the back caught fire and vented into two upstairs flats.
1430 2018-04-30 20:58:23 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
1431 2018-04-30 20:58:07 I make Keto friendly protein bites for a client of mine. Almond butter,  coconut oil, melted together. Remove from heat, add in coconut flour and cocoa to taste (she has me add in a few drops of stevia.) Freeze for 15 min, then roll into 1" balls, roll in crushed pecans or cashew
1432 2018-04-30 20:58:05 An empty oil barrel, to be more precise?
1433 2018-04-30 20:58:05 Sure... Let’s see what happens to GM Financial when interest rates and oil prices surge in 2H18.
1434 2018-04-30 20:58:03 Got my oil change done tho, next clean up my room and then hang out with my friend :D
1435 2018-04-30 20:57:57 When do you add the fuel oil?
1436 2018-04-30 20:57:52 All the economic changes in the Kingdom where we are in the process of being less reliant on oil r driven from young leader ship..get ur youth in charge and Nigeria will be amongst leading countries not only in Africa
1437 2018-04-30 20:57:52 Well since I have already posed this question a very long time ago seems none of you know. The last monopoly in the United States a real monopoly was Standard Oil. We all should know how that piece of history turned out. Or have the liberal teachers stopped teaching it.
1438 2018-04-30 20:57:48 I'm honestly sooo excited for oil ranch with @katyebaker1 !!

1445 2018-04-30 20:57:05 I’ve started cooking dinners with no oil or fat - just a couple of tablespoons of water on the pan at the start before onions, garlic whatever go in. Works like a dream!
1446 2018-04-30 20:57:03 Really not sure but maybe same as getting it out of hair?? Something like olive oil?
1447 2018-04-30 20:56:59 Show me the money! Well, @SecretaryZinke just did in National Park Visitor Spending in Park gateways: $18.2 billion. Invest in Park restauration now!

1448 2018-04-30 20:56:54 So basically this is just all for the oil industry to make profit right? Thats exactly what you're pointing here
1449 2018-04-30 20:56:42 #Hemp is a high-yield crop. One acre of hemp produces twice as much oil as one acre of peanuts, and nearly four times as much fiber pulp (for paper) as an acre of #trees.

1450 2018-04-30 20:56:28 Oil is gone 
1451 2018-04-30 20:56:27 This is rich. The PLO has no economy, water, food, industry, electricity , natural resources, oil, infrastructure, education, or competent government. Why do you think a Palestinian state would have any durability to survive?
1452 2018-04-30 20:56:18 That actually looks really good considering. Have you got any Neosporin from US? Is amazing on scars... Bio Oil if not.
1453 2018-04-30 20:56:12 Slightly disagree...it's hard to say that he's "owned" by anyone...there are too many pulling on that leash!  The Gun lobby, the Oil lobby, the Drug lobby...pick your poison, Trump and the GOP have picked them all over the American People.

1455 2018-04-30 20:55:46 ended up spending $250 when really all that I wanted done was get my car oil changed 
1456 2018-04-30 20:55:32 Oil!
1457 2018-04-30 20:55:18 Getting that on my skin was...unpleasant.

While working in food service, I spilled some 350F oil from the fryer onto my pants. In less than a second, my pants were around my ankles. No way I was letting that stuff cook me.
1458 2018-04-30 20:55:18 NG should pour gallons of cooking oil on the Mexican side of wall. And have fire hoses ready to knock back anyone that reach's the top
1459 2018-04-30 20:55:09 Generally, that's because oil prices are going up. We don't have that sub 50 dollar a barrel oil anymore - it's pretty much all above 60 dollars
1460 2018-04-30 20:54:59 i think it’s so funny that whenever i’m like “feel my hair it’s so soft” han is like “did u steal more hair oil from the salon again”
1461 2018-04-30 20:54:54 But Nigeria has oil and a human-rights denying authoritarian leader - so ...

1463 2018-04-30 20:54:43 Lol. No one with power does that. Even preconditions are part of the trade. It is all about leverage. If the US does not want our oil, China or Russia have more leverage, and they'll use it to their advantage.
1464 2018-04-30 20:54:41 U gotta put oil in yo shit. Small amount can stretch.. INDOT got some more jobs open tho

1466 2018-04-30 20:54:40 Donald Trump took d opportunity to market his country's product. Buhari did not despite given the opportunity with question about crude oil. That shows mindset of both Presidents. Maybe if they asked about cows(agric product) he may have said better.
1467 2018-04-30 20:54:37 Can we just get rid of all homeopathic remedies? Citizens shouldn't be tricked into buying BS "health products" from snake oil salesmen.
1468 2018-04-30 20:54:34 Is resource demand increases or decreasing? What makes you think resource can't be technology jobs, too? Any idea how technical one must be to run a oil or mining operation? Plus, oil demand is increasing not decreasing. We should be developing responsibly along with renewables.

1481 2018-04-30 20:52:36 Oil and gas companies are make you pay more so that they can fund their propaganda campaign to tell you Carbon Taxes are bad and fill the Conservatives war chest in upcoming election(s). Y'all get played. #cdnpoli

1483 2018-04-30 20:52:30 I actually do a number of things to offset my job requirement of travel. And my personal travel. Willing to bet my carbon footprint is lower than many. But I’d also love it if AB diversified its economy even more and I don’t believe oil is the right future.
1484 2018-04-30 20:52:27 I am watching ‘The Sand’ on the horror channel. Haven’t paid attention but for some reason there is a big fat black man stuffed into an oil drum on the beach. He has a nob and bollocks drawn on his face. @Duckingbarstool @CoffeeAndGinger @SweatyTDog

1486 2018-04-30 20:52:20 Hey Jason, It's artificially high right now because of sketchy reasons by big oil and you know it. Carbon tax is a small part of this. When oil was a $100 a barrel our gas was $1.25. You just have to be more forthcoming

1488 2018-04-30 20:52:06 At the end of the day..this is all hype created as expected for oil prices.. Trump nor the republicans want higher oil prices in the midterm year and they know that..the Iran deal will not be cancelled...the #OOTT morons can take that to the bank:)
1489 2018-04-30 20:51:57 I can't speak for the dogs, but daily krill oil supplements changed my life, tbh.

1495 2018-04-30 20:51:20 Crude oil broke above the trend line I had marked last week. Will be watching to see if it breaks higher and closes higher above the line. If it closes above, the trend line could act as support and lead to a fib going to the upside.
1496 2018-04-30 20:51:08 The U.S government is gonna come for my hair there is so much oil in it...
1497 2018-04-30 20:51:04 Because the oil companies want to make some more excess profits.

1501 2018-04-30 20:50:39 The only up side is that you could probably write off the cost of the plane ticket come tax time next year, as part of your modeling business.  

But, my guess, crude oil prices is the culprit. And corporate greed.
1502 2018-04-30 20:50:35 The WHCD is like a miracle of bad twitter content, there should have been only enough oil for one day, but here we are, still burning.

1511 2018-04-30 20:49:50 Part of this is me being annoyed that people don't realize the Soviet Union fell because of an oil shock. Their "oil shock -> balance of payments/external debt crisis -> domestic economy collapse due to inability to do internal adjustment" dynamic is very similar to Venezuela.
1512 2018-04-30 20:49:43 All I wanted was an oil change sis

1521 2018-04-30 20:48:37 Absolutely brutal, it used 2 b that the oil companies would always have an excuse ready 2 tell the public, now they don't even bother. That tells me that we r suckers in their massive profits or that our government is fine with taxing us yet again beyond what's reasonable
1522 2018-04-30 20:48:29 I think oil and gas has artificially inflated salaries yes. But I certainly don’t begrudge people living wages. Not by a long shot. I just wish we’d value some other roles more than we do, teachers as one example.
1523 2018-04-30 20:48:28 This was how the genocide in Rwanda started. The world looked the other way while about a million peoole were murdered in six months. As long as oil keep flowing  innocent nigerians being murdered are abondoned to thier own faith.

1548 2018-04-30 20:45:45 It's the last 30 years that have gone nowhere/backwards. I talked to guys in the oil patch who were making $25-30 an hour in the 80's. Starting wages. That's what it is today.

1556 2018-04-30 20:43:58 These people we call independent oil marketers wanted govt to increase petrol pump price so they ensured we suffered a long period of hardship.

The president insisted that Nigerians shouldn't be made to bear more burden. Today, some of them sell it between N140 and N143.

They’re not sure how much oil spilled into the alley behind the store but crews are working to clean it up
1563 2018-04-30 20:43:03 Lots of oil-producing countries have less state capacity and about as corruption as Venezuela but handled the oil shock better than they did. In general the *brittleness* of central planning is a bigger deal than the inefficiency of central planning, but gets way less attention.

1577 2018-04-30 20:41:42 Also sort of off topic but I had to point out that the advent of widespread oil production is what put an end to whaling as a major industry worldwide, which makes your last tweet sort of ironic ;)

1617 2018-04-30 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1618 2018-04-30 20:35:05 It's always all about grabbing resources. Initially, fertile and arable lands. Later, crude oil and mineral rich lands. In all cases, dispensing with the lives of the people of those lands as if they were meant to further fertilize the grabbed lands. #Retributionawaits
1619 2018-04-30 20:34:56 OIL IT
1620 2018-04-30 20:34:46 Someone should tell her how they put out burning oil wells.
1621 2018-04-30 20:34:30 Clearly R Kelly took the Cosby PR approach to this mess, that statement is just a flaming cauldron of oil poured over everything
1622 2018-04-30 20:34:24 there's more people working in tech in BC than oil/gas, forestry, and mining combined.
1623 2018-04-30 20:34:14 Also don't forget that it was all about the U.K.'s oil interests in Iran. (DUH!)
1624 2018-04-30 20:33:56 What oil? Do you realise they probably have more oil than we do and might soon control fuel price and not OPEC and at the same time they have set targets to move away from Oil in the very near future? The world is changing and Africa has refused to catch up
1625 2018-04-30 20:33:26 Our own old man just go they do 'yes sir yes sir' Reasonable question he know ask .....
Just "sitting and saying yes sir " without reasonable input.
He asked u about CORRUPTION but u never asked him about why the US no longer purchase oil as they use to.
Old Man...come back home
1626 2018-04-30 20:33:09 Et les enfants à l'école c'était juste un exemple.

1629 2018-04-30 20:32:49 Why they wants war ? Against Russia ?
In Middle East , for cheap oil ?? 
There must be much more..
1630 2018-04-30 20:32:45 Central planning is a bad idea and everything but the real lesson from the USSR/Venezuela is more specifically that capitalist economies handle internal adjustment after oil shocks *much* better than centrally planned ones.
1631 2018-04-30 20:32:45 100% agree. They literally bought their recent success with oil money. No class about them either
1632 2018-04-30 20:32:35 You mean he's going to insult wilder then blame Wilder for the fight not taking place.A snake oil salesman who has no integrity and scared of the fight. A.J makes him money so doesn't want to lose his meal ticket.
1633 2018-04-30 20:32:31 Nah lol. I don’t need oil. That’s the problem. My engine faulty. Now I’m getting a new Benz coupe fuck them

1642 2018-04-30 20:31:37 @GhostAdventures @Zak_Bagans @BillyTolley @AaronGoodwin @jaywasley Did anyone take a sample of the oil and have it tested that was dripping from the blinds from the house in IN? Just curious.
1643 2018-04-30 20:31:33 I’m not sure how modern tech would make that happen. Unless they’re somehow developing it and selling it on the open market, which would make it little different than oil and Venezuela.
1644 2018-04-30 20:31:28 Bruh. He couldn't even get a deal for them to buy our oil. He just went there to waste time and money
1645 2018-04-30 20:31:06 Try as a peeling: olive oil and sugar or salt and as a mask healing earth (?) with water. It helps for me. Have fun on Saturday!
1646 2018-04-30 20:30:54 For all the reasons listed, I no longer teach. In TX, we do have a pension. I’ve worked for an international oil company as a marketing rep. I’ve been a consultant at Enron. I tried teaching & it’s the most difficult job I’ve ever had. Those judging on the outside, u have no idea

1650 2018-04-30 20:29:53 Why not build more refineries in Alberta? Create REAL longterm job. Factor in the jobs, lower environmental risks of shipping bitumen to Asia, political discourse, and much profits for refined oil. Please investigate longterm cost & benefits. I agree with @ElizabethMay on this.

1655 2018-04-30 20:29:03 @MadeleineOlivia been loving the oil cleansing! But do you have a recommendation for dealing with fine lines developing???
1656 2018-04-30 20:28:55 Well not quite but I would easily go through half a litre of oil and a block of butter in a week (I recipe test 5ish a day and cook for a very busy household...)
1657 2018-04-30 20:28:47 Microwave Hot Egg Free Cake - 1tsp butter, 2tsp oil, 3tsp sugar, 3tsp flour, 1tsp baking powder, glug of milk (any kind), dash of any flavouring (cocoa, vanilla, strawberry) get nice size mug, mix all ingredients, blast in micro 2-3 minutes. Finish with topping of choice
1658 2018-04-30 20:28:44 I  their lemon pepper seasoning and garlic olive oil esp for the price. And the “a pumpkin walks into a” bars
1659 2018-04-30 20:28:43 $35 billion/yr is lost from CDN economy because we sell 3 million bbl/day of oil to USA at too low prices and because we import 1 million bbl/day of foreign oil at top dollar.  On so many counts, Liberal economics is a huge failure

1661 2018-04-30 20:28:24 Making it to the oil drums, to light a fire to keep warm, was a right pain! :)
1662 2018-04-30 20:28:24 This study was filmed for TV. 450 kcal is a lot; people ate butter on bread and potatoes, whereas olive oil and coconut oil were more often taken separately.
1663 2018-04-30 20:28:18 Palm oil is used in a lot more than just food products, actually. Do your research. I'm also not going to purchase a can of palm oil. Who does that? Lol You use coconut, canola, vegetable, and olive oil. Occasionally palm oil.
1664 2018-04-30 20:28:17 @CNBCClosingBell @michaelsantoli @KellyEvansCNBC In addition, while Helima Croft plans for the worst to occur in oil market with loss of Iranian crude....something tells me that our Prez IS ALREADY PREPARING US producers/shale, allies to make up the difference
1665 2018-04-30 20:28:07 yes me to I cant spell for carp but I can draw it for U, so I know that to be true, I think I know how the first tattoos got started to, someone got a cut and had fat/oil on the hand then got charcoal in it. who really knows but its fun to fined out right.
1666 2018-04-30 20:28:04 Medieval tactics would be pouring hot oil on them, or stretching the lazy scumbags on a rack until they denounce begging. Making them mildly inconvenienced about where they walk is not enough.

1668 2018-04-30 20:27:47 Got my car inspected just in case I needed any work done while I can’t drive it anyways I was expecting maybe an oil change but no, find out my car is fucked and it’s going to cost more to repair it then get a new one. Fucking yay
1669 2018-04-30 20:27:41 You're not a realist if you don't care that blocking TMP makes a spill both more likely and more likely to be serious, or if you think we're going to run out of oil any time soon or if you think punishing domestic production helps the environment while we import OPEC oil.
1670 2018-04-30 20:27:34 WTF snake oil fake treatment is this??? Would a dentist know?

1674 2018-04-30 20:27:05 Water passages from heads flow through the intake and the gaskets being plastic will fall apart normally letting the water flow into the lifter valley thus filling the oil pan.
1675 2018-04-30 20:27:00 What's the oil for?
1676 2018-04-30 20:26:56 I saw Ms Tierney in her later years when she lived in Houston and was married to a Houston oil man. She was shopping in a dept store. Still lovely.
1677 2018-04-30 20:26:55 So far this week I’ve been:

3. Late to lunch

1684 2018-04-30 20:25:18 Surely no more diesel cars would have a huge impact on the oil companies?  #motorhour
1685 2018-04-30 20:25:10 Absurd is having Transmountain blocked while BC and Canada continue to import oil from us and Saudi Arabia and the US slowly sucking all corporate investment in Canada away to the US and  other countries.

1689 2018-04-30 20:24:13 4 weeks ago, on a Monday, I had a flat tire that I needed to get changed.  I decided to get an oil change as well.  Took 7 hours for that to happen.
1690 2018-04-30 20:23:59 A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day to the core I don’t ever open up ‘cause I know people change like the oil
1691 2018-04-30 20:23:36 I had dandruff really bad but I actually got rid of it! I put some peppermint oil in your shampoo and a little in your oil mixture and that should help get rid of it.

1693 2018-04-30 20:23:25 If pulled out of Iran deal, oil price will spike up. That’s going to help Russia. Wondering if there’s a conspiracy there. cannot lessen sanction on Putin but can help Russians earn more money from their vast holdings on oil and gas.

1696 2018-04-30 20:22:57 Of course the UK, France and Germany like the Iran deal. They are probably getting oil out the back door from Iran.
1697 2018-04-30 20:22:39 ... destroy what remains of the rainforests and population of larger animals. Life might simply become a bit of a shit. Mayer said a long time ago that we have enough oil in the ground to kill ourselves. Will that happen?

1699 2018-04-30 20:22:16 Let's just say I got out before the "unofficial" fight over oil (rather the "Cease Fire")became OFFICIAL! (1998-2002)
1700 2018-04-30 20:22:07 This is sounding more & more like a socialist govt. We need the economy (incl the biggest plus to GDP, oil/gas) to prosper so everyone has the opportunity to make their most of what Canada has to offer. We don’t need the liberal’s & NDP’s controlling opinion of what equality is
1701 2018-04-30 20:21:59 While running to answer the land line circa 2000, ran into my roommate's creepy old oil painting of a crabby-looking jerk—plumed military hat, heavy gilded frame—and broke my toe. It still hurts when I drive.
1702 2018-04-30 20:21:51 And @RoobNBCS is a statistical genius!

1708 2018-04-30 20:20:59 Palm oil is a common vegetable oil in a variety of foods that our kids love like Fruit Loops and Oreos.

1710 2018-04-30 20:20:37 For Californian’s it’s a game played between oil (tycoon)executives and State Government to bleed Californian’s dry financially. Last time I looked we didn’t design or build the vehicles we purchased. Gasoline has been used for almost two hundred years. After Kerosine.
1711 2018-04-30 20:20:31 I’m allergic to peanuts and they fried them in peanut oil
1712 2018-04-30 20:20:26 There’s a joke in there somewhere about Nigeria wanting the US to send more money after the drop in oil purchases question.

1715 2018-04-30 20:19:51 Somehow media getting, and publishing comment from the very people who make insane amounts of profit (the oil industry & associates) seems rather unfair. 
Of course they're going to say anything to ensure their huge profits remains.
1716 2018-04-30 20:19:42 先日改めて見て驚きがあったのが、イギリスの「作者不詳」のペインティング。16C初頭のものの技術が興味深い。フランドルあたりの混合技法っぽいけど、表記はOil on Woodだった。透層がすごく薄そうなので、下層は脱脂のテンペラ系だろうけど、イギリスへはどのルートで技法が渡っていたのだろうか。

1730 2018-04-30 20:17:56 This is outrageous. The oil companies and #BootPruitt have made Oklahoma the earthquake state.
1731 2018-04-30 20:17:51 Great idea! Now put your time and effort into that, but until then we need oil.
1732 2018-04-30 20:17:50 As you note, they are prescription drugs, but they all highly purified fish oils providing extremely high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. Certain fish oil supplements are also highly purified and provide comparable levels of omega-3 fatty acids.

1734 2018-04-30 20:17:42 9-11 was planned by US .Bush evaded Iraq claiming had Chemical weapons and supporting Alqaeda kill innocent Iraqis for nothing . Where are the chemical Weapons in Iraq?  Instead US was stealing Oil from Iraq through Kuwait.
1735 2018-04-30 20:17:32 Oil lamps just seem so inefficient and fragile. Nalgene bottles, bow those could trap a genie for a few millenia.
1736 2018-04-30 20:17:27 I look forward to Trump's rants against the oil companies when gasoline prices hit the roof and make him look bad.

1740 2018-04-30 20:17:12 So, U.S. is experiencing @realDonaldTrump’s ineptitude from all sides. His unwillingness to confront Russia’s interference on our election and determination to sow chaos politically in U.S. and his policy of doing away with renewable energy to lessen foreign oil dependence.

1751 2018-04-30 20:16:16 @DLHughleyRadio its 2018 mortgage is not $500 a mortgage plus 2 car notes and all the other bills that sounds like shes my child and not to mention finding a woman that cooks nowadays is like finding oil in your back yard so her buying food is almost irrelevant
1752 2018-04-30 20:16:14 Don't be so daft. Of course we still need to pump some oil for plastics and other products. Until we can fully recycle what we've already created. Burning the stuff is just outdated, inefficient, wasteful and uneconomical.
1753 2018-04-30 20:16:11 no its bomb af for your skin & coconut oil is the best for me 
1754 2018-04-30 20:16:03 This is their lie, their excuse to go to war w/Iran. 

And this time, they will carpet bomb and take the oil, just like they campaigned on.

War hungry greedy GOP will fall for this again. Weaklings.
1755 2018-04-30 20:16:03 Your hoodie is everything. Also,  have you thought about using a beard oil/balm?
1756 2018-04-30 20:15:59 Υπερβολική χρήση baby oil
1757 2018-04-30 20:15:55 “I would surely recommend it, but I would also recommend the lobster risotto with truffle and lemon oil or the carbonara.”

He said and allowed a light laughter to escape his lips before he continued.

“..actually, I wanna bet you that everything from here is good.” +
1758 2018-04-30 20:15:54 Fact! California has a lot of natural gas storage wells.
California imports most of its natural gas.
Californian’s are duped by California oil companies to pay more for gasoline by refineries producing less. How much of this is mandated by state officials?
1759 2018-04-30 20:15:50 No it aint. The question is why the oil giants spend eye watering amounts of money on exploration. Perhaps to ensure that you have no choices/alternatives in the marketplace.
1760 2018-04-30 20:15:48 Whataboutism is the integer that balances the equation.
1761 2018-04-30 20:15:30 Life lesson learned today. DO NOT mix coconut oil into your coffee. You’ll be in for a bad time 
1762 2018-04-30 20:15:27 The results that virgin coconut oil did not increase LDL-C greater than extra-virgin olive oil is interesting and warrants further studies with longer duration and cross-over design.
1763 2018-04-30 20:15:22 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1764 2018-04-30 20:15:13 What about the impact fees? You don’t get both. Do areas that ban oil and gas should benefit.  You are such a political hack. Tax and spend liberals re all the same @mrsalysonjoyce
1765 2018-04-30 20:15:10 Nope. Keep those hands free. Laser claws? Ok, now we're cooking with peanut oil.
1766 2018-04-30 20:15:07 Today I Learned: that Norwegian people (the country) own part of most of the oil and gas fields; revenues pay for many social services
1767 2018-04-30 20:15:02 If President Trump is indeed concerned about the killing of Christians in Nigeria, Biafrans, where the very crude Oil is coming from, why dealing with Nigerian corrupt terrorist governmen t? I really dont understand.

1769 2018-04-30 20:14:50 I would go, but Mondays in June is when I do my ayurvedic oil pulling. Hope they hit a triple-double!
1770 2018-04-30 20:14:49 Don't forget Obama having air force fly over targeted areas, having planes throwing out yellow paper flyers, warning ISIS of the US air attacks!  There was a video of an ISIS truck driver hauling oil or gas, stopping the truck, getting out and hauling ass.
1771 2018-04-30 20:14:46 And there’s a long-term play with stuff like $VDE (IMO) for energy... oil topping $100/bbl by year end seems more and more likely once $UUP $DXY ceases upward correction and dollar *really* starts to fall
1772 2018-04-30 20:14:36 Daily Mail - no, hatemongers. Greggs - fine with pastrymongers. Primark - no problem. I despair at 'fast fashion' and disposable clothes but they're working hard on an ethical supply chain. I doubt many would complain. That's why the focus is on oil arms, not clothes and pasties
1773 2018-04-30 20:14:35 Highest oil production in our county's history right now. Try again
1774 2018-04-30 20:14:29 At OIL!!!
1775 2018-04-30 20:14:28 But u wee not leave oil soup alone
1776 2018-04-30 20:14:27 The coolest thing about high gas prices in Western Canada is how they have nothing to do with growing demand, a bullish world oil market, refinery turnaround season, the looming Saudi Aramco IPO, and everything to do with drinking from a short straw instead of two #bcpoli
1777 2018-04-30 20:14:27 Thanks for sharing @puddleg! I had seen this article when researching for my presentation. This was a very short duration study (4-weeks), but did support previous findings that butter increases LDL-C greater than coconut oil.
1778 2018-04-30 20:14:25 Castor oil. Rub that in your scalp twice a week & then shampoo after. But mix the castor oil with another oil like avocado, almond or olive oil since castor oil is very thick & sticky.
1779 2018-04-30 20:13:50 It's nice to see the #okleg taking a break from making their donors in the oil and gas industry richer to make their donors in the private prison industry richer. Who says these guys don't know how to multitask?
1780 2018-04-30 20:13:46 I recently learned about the amazing health benefits of Black Seed Oil, so I thought I would try it. After about a week of taking 1 teaspoon per day, I imagine this is what power steering fluid must taste like.
1781 2018-04-30 20:13:33 Market IV: Interesting inter-market phenomena in this last week of April include a sharp rise in U.S.-dollar-priced crude #oil even as the USD rebounds vs both the #euro and #yen. At one point, #WTI #futures reach $69.23 a barrel today. WTI now up 13% YTD #commodities
1782 2018-04-30 20:13:32 @bcalmanac "World leading standards" for ocean #oil spill cleanup is 10-15% of the spill - in perfect conditions.  #Bitumen sinks.  #stopkm. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1783 2018-04-30 20:13:28 Millions and millions of dollars go into many media deceptions all from  oil money perhaps going up to Presidential candidates and certainly into  bogus UFO talkers videos and what not. Everyone puts in 2 cents so I'll  try for Nikola Tesla.
1784 2018-04-30 20:13:17 I have a bigwig oil man in the family in  Texas, he's a Democrat.
1785 2018-04-30 20:13:15 I love that @katyhearnFit is launching a CBD oil product line. I wish this topic got more recognition! 
1786 2018-04-30 20:13:15 I also tend to drown them in olive oil lmao

If oil & silver are linked; where do you see silver demand at $300 oil?

1789 2018-04-30 20:12:55 The petrol price is regulated by the department of energy. Also, while Secunda is a coal-to-liquids facility, natref is a traditional oil refinery. In total, both facilities account for less than a third of SA's fuel.

1797 2018-04-30 20:11:57 Because of Netanyahu ridiculous presentation oil prices are starting to go up. Trump cancel the Iran deal and watch oil prices hit 70 say goodbye American economy. #Trump #MAGA #MondayMotivation #Oil #oilandgas #cnbc @realDonaldTrump #Iran #IranDeal
1798 2018-04-30 20:11:56 Dude it taste like oil or something, I mean I will still drink it but it's so nasty!!!! Lmao I rather drink patron to!
1799 2018-04-30 20:11:53 Any idea, what is the growth rate of "Global Oil Consumption", year-on-year?
1800 2018-04-30 20:11:48 -  Yawn  -  there’s always an excuse. But, when the problem is rectified, price never drops. Question is: Why are the American Oil Companies forced to show their supply levels (on a weekly basis) but not us? Simple marketing price strategy.  btw, gas is $.89 litre in Bellingham
1801 2018-04-30 20:11:44 Put some oil on that fence
1802 2018-04-30 20:11:42 The oil industry is not suffering from a lack of capital. If there was a business case for a new Canadian refinery, someone in the private sector would be trying build one.

1807 2018-04-30 20:11:08 HOLY SHIT YES!!! Chalree's life hacks, in the nude! Mom never taught you how to pre-treat stains? If grass stains come out better in cold or hot water? Spilled car oil on your favorite shirt? Are you generally useless at taking care of yourself She's here to help. With boobs. 
1808 2018-04-30 20:11:03 Yeah that's the NTB that never has time to do my oil changes despite me having an appointment. Not going to call it what it is but........
1809 2018-04-30 20:10:59 Dear natural hair journey diary,

Last night after applying castor oil to my scalp I slept in a freebandz beanie to protect my sheets and pillows.
1810 2018-04-30 20:10:52 They are going to need liniment oil for all their current attempts to say why it's still 'ironic'. The contortions are epic.
1811 2018-04-30 20:10:37 Dude said he wouldn’t be surprised if my tire popped on the way home from this oil change  I guess that’s what I guess for putting this off for 8 months

1815 2018-04-30 20:10:21 These countries extermely rich in resources. The corruption and misuse of them is appalling.
But let's all focus on what 1 man said.

1817 2018-04-30 20:10:20 There is no monopoly. Please educate yourself on what a monopoly is. The last monopoly held in the United Stated was Standard Oil and we all know what happened there. At least we should.
1818 2018-04-30 20:10:17 Fuck them both .The circus clown we have running the country won’t do anything about it . He’s to busy defending his lawsuit and nominating shit heads.And oil companies no longer have to report there profits. So grab your ankles.

Well I guess some guy was watching me from inside the store and made a point to stop me tell me I’m “hotter than the 4th of July, fireworks and all”
1824 2018-04-30 20:09:29 Nigeria has a bunch of Oil. End of story here.
1825 2018-04-30 20:09:18 I doubt it. Money, power, oil, natural resources, have been a far bigger cause of war than religion. But you are trying hard to make it so.
1826 2018-04-30 20:09:18 Only the price of Russian oil will benefit from that mess Strange ?? I wonder who put trump up to that !!

I'm guessing it had a lot of beef grease from the hamburger grill.

1843 2018-04-30 20:07:43 The oil issue whether it's a curse or blessing to the country is subject to debate. @MBuhari is the chief markerter of Nigeria project. I expected him to market our major source of income for now to the highest consumer of fuel in the world
1844 2018-04-30 20:07:34 According to my husband, I'm supposed to tell Darrin that the oil waste is in the elevator. I don't have an elevator or know a Darrin. #text #marriage #atleastilaughed

1849 2018-04-30 20:06:34 The only reason our government is "helping Nigeria withe terrorists" is to get the troops in to secure their oil.

1855 2018-04-30 20:05:24 When asked if @MBuhari discuss the prospect of US buying more crude oil our amiable president said he can't tell US what to do but US is discussing with him how the can import their agricultural produce to Nigeria.

1872 2018-04-30 20:03:36 Your pores are clogged. You need to either steam and extract them yourself by squeezing your nose, or book in for a facial and request a therapist to do it.

1875 2018-04-30 20:03:17 Another article by a left wing columnist who has no idea about what she writes.  Her opinion is worth less than the pixels they are formed upon.   Oil is the lifeblood of a modern world,  without it hundreds of millions would go hungry,  economies collapse,  no matter to her.
1876 2018-04-30 20:03:16 He has since learned Nigeria has oil. That changes everything!
1877 2018-04-30 20:03:11 A great effort OPG! Ontario consumers are paying to reduce emissions by 17 million tonnes just as Justin Trudeau gives a green light to pipelines that will enable Alberta oil sands to emit more than 24 million tonnes. It's time Alberta started reducing, not increasing, emissions.
1878 2018-04-30 20:03:02 my sense of humor is really shit i just accidentally dumped a lot of hot oil in my soup and said out loud "she snapped ur honor!" and i /still/ find it funny as i write lmao

1884 2018-04-30 20:02:23 It might. But it also might not. Some employees may say 'Oil Company A is the greatest company on the planet and I am proud to contribute to their success'. But someone else might say 'it's a dirty business but, hey, there's not many jobs round here'...

1887 2018-04-30 20:02:10 "What if you took a stone from your hard place, took anointing oil, put it on it &  that hard place became an altar. What if it became a gate.

1888 2018-04-30 20:01:47 Thank you for that information Tony,  I can tell you that the majority of Americans want pipe lines,it’s the safest method of moving oil & gas .
1889 2018-04-30 20:01:46 People who wear specs: 

don't use those terrible cloths they give you at the optician to clean your lenses. Microfiber cloth is your best bet. Can remove dust and film/oil layers without water. It's about R35 at Pick n Pay 
1890 2018-04-30 20:01:45 So advanced they didn’t use any oil or gas.

1894 2018-04-30 20:01:07 the chain should feel oily, when you use the pedals the chain will move around in a continuous circle but without the oil it's much harder to turn. it would be pretty obvious if it was oily, it may also leave black residue on your finger after touching
1895 2018-04-30 20:01:04 Yeah we’ve picked up a few in central London, those architects drive me nuts haha but they are keeping me busy ..

1904 2018-04-30 20:00:12 Forever ANGRY that I never learned how to do an oil change
1905 2018-04-30 20:00:11 I’d usually either submerge it in brine or oil after opening - it’s amazing if you use good olive oil and oregano/chilli/garlic. Lasts for as long as you like and improves the flavour
1906 2018-04-30 20:00:04 Yes, agreed, it’s a very serious issue. More greenwashing? Like those *environmental consultancies* consulting for oil companies. #MuseumHour

1910 2018-04-30 19:59:33 Will this have any impact on the timing of some pending big employment decisions?  Janus and Murphy Oil?  Or is that work largely done?
1911 2018-04-30 19:59:28 Where are you going to get your oil to refine?
1912 2018-04-30 19:59:20 Ask mr Grady  to get me a shot and a beer then it’s off to murder olive oil.
1913 2018-04-30 19:59:09 No oil ? Seriously ? Need to cook on lower heat ?

1915 2018-04-30 19:58:44 getting my oil changed on the beast. later
1916 2018-04-30 19:58:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1917 2018-04-30 19:58:37 oooo the smell of coconut tanning oil  missed that
1918 2018-04-30 19:58:32 Besides, midnight oil is like. Late 80s. New enough for me haha.
1919 2018-04-30 19:58:11 If this oil change takes more than 30 minutes I will not be happy
1920 2018-04-30 19:57:52 In ontario we get more than half of the oil from the us. Not a big deal and its about $1.30 and cheaper at costco. Sure if BC does not want tar sand oil, they will simply get it from the us. Dont forget that alberta exports also to us via the abbotsford pipe line. Less exports
1921 2018-04-30 19:57:51 You sound like a religious extremist nut case.

You are supporting yet another war in a far off land where your military will murder hundreds of thousands of innocents on the words of this king of terror, Netanyahu. 

Wasn’t Iraq enough land, oil and  murder for you? 

Want more?
1922 2018-04-30 19:57:44 It's more than that. It was the 'numbers game' and the oil game. 
The Jews were small and poor in land and resources.
The US State Department played the same games
1923 2018-04-30 19:57:41 Agree with you Mr trump. Very filthy and vulgar. She can express her disagreement using decent words.
1924 2018-04-30 19:57:29 They're said to dislike eucalyptus , you could try the oil on used tea bags dotted about ,only useful if it stays dry though
1925 2018-04-30 19:57:29 Even if they did, could they out play big oil?
1926 2018-04-30 19:57:24 It probably is. But it is a shithole full of oil.
1927 2018-04-30 19:57:18 I dont know how they are stealing tax payer money and the oil spill causing billions is hypothetical with no real basis and you are just saying you dont trust the risk assessment that was done by professionals. Frankly the BC govt is not abiding by the law not KM
1928 2018-04-30 19:57:02 @WhiteHouse Looks like we are going to war in Syria and Iran, still in Afghanistan. What is the end game here? Oil $150p.b., global eco. melt down, migrant crises into Europe intensification,  possible ww3? This is the globalist plan.
1929 2018-04-30 19:57:02 Bitch I got a new tire, the man tell me I need a new wheel barring. I get some Freon, these niggas say I need new filters  bitch I’m tryna see why my sensor lights on, I get a new battery, now I need an oil change.

1935 2018-04-30 19:56:13 Widening trade gap, massive deficits, lower tax revenues, and rapidly rising oil prices (currently at $68.46 per barrel). Yay, Trump! 
1936 2018-04-30 19:56:04 @GovMikeHuckabee wants us to be nice to his daughter Sarah. That's honorable so I'll do my best:

1937 2018-04-30 19:56:01 I drove through Indianapolis once, and found myself on a cracked road, with barely any trace of what should be asphalt and looking up to see the entrance to a large arena.
It was the Lucas Oil Stadium, and the surrounding roads were something out of an apocalypse.
1938 2018-04-30 19:56:00 I warned you about Watford 14/1 in2horse race I am ewt house can't watch that was before kick off It wont surprise me if the Russian oil Stealers not sending brown paper bags  they stand to lose 90 m we gotta window up to 65mins before S/H kicks in then it get even more scary
1939 2018-04-30 19:55:35 I hope i feel this way when I finally get my oil changed
1940 2018-04-30 19:55:19 Trump doesn't care about his base. He's actively hurt their interests on multiple bases, unless you mean his corporate interests then higher oil prices actually aid them.
1941 2018-04-30 19:55:16 US oil production will soon offset the price of our oil and our production. But yes we have a bright fellow negotiating the future of our country
1942 2018-04-30 19:55:15 $46.99 for a Jiffy Lube oil change. Ridiculous!! Never using them again. Ever.
1943 2018-04-30 19:55:08 @Kathleen_Wynne What’s up with gas prices in Ontario at $1.37 avg and cost of oil is half it was when gas was last at 1.37?  We are getting taken for a ride literally!
1944 2018-04-30 19:55:08 Buhari: we still have oil
Trump: so all you want is to win the 2019 election, I have the best guys, they are experienced I am a stable genius, consider it done. Just sign the papers. Thank you
1945 2018-04-30 19:55:06 40 tons of fuel and oil a day on modern container ships.

Depending on usage nuclear ships can go decades with zero carbon emissions.

Hadn't looked specifically at the ice breakers though.
1946 2018-04-30 19:54:59 Not sure where they are getting in. Maybe under door seal. May spray with concentrated peppermint oil, which they don't like, apparently.
1947 2018-04-30 19:54:58 changed diet multiple times... witch hazel makes me break out, tea tree oil makes my skin more oily and i drink 8l of water a day, tried so many facials but it really doesnt help and i was keeping my routines long as possible and there was no effect 
1948 2018-04-30 19:54:53 It's a 7 person passenger van, are you able to change oil on vehicles that heavy?
1949 2018-04-30 19:54:46 Took off my semi's short hedge $SOXS. $SOXX is at a trend support here. Will re-enter if we crack. Key level here. Watching oil for a long position. hunting oil stocks. Oil is holding up very well looks poised to breakout. $USO #oilandgas #oilprice
1950 2018-04-30 19:54:43 Are u sure this man is not seeling our Oil...This one way trump day laff so..Ehhnn i talk ma own oo
1951 2018-04-30 19:54:34 Yep, I know his are small. But every $$ counts for Oil now. Highly doubt any Oilers in future hit their B bonus, which is the big one. Hard to be top-10 in G/A/PTS or PPG league wide. Well, that is assuming they don't get another top-3 pick...God help them and fans if they do.
1952 2018-04-30 19:54:32 Lemme get my ass up and go get this oil change
1953 2018-04-30 19:54:24 I think the world can cope with oil $60-$80 anything above is unsustainable in the LT
1954 2018-04-30 19:54:07 i have LEGIT so much acrylic paint, oil paint, watercolor paint, canvases big/small/mini, 30+ brushes, and multiple pallets AND I STILL FEEL NO DESIRE TO MAKE ART OR PAINT THIS IS AWFUL ITS HAUNTING ME

1957 2018-04-30 19:53:39 The only thing that interests Washington and London in Syria is money, namely gas and oil. You do not care about the Syrian people and even Christians
1958 2018-04-30 19:53:16 Our oil demand is falling precipitously though with our alt energy improvements. We may actually hit peak oil consumption in the US before global peal oil production is truly realized.
1959 2018-04-30 19:53:15 Michigan needs to turn it around or else the Great Lakes are gonna be one giant oil slick.
1960 2018-04-30 19:53:14 I think US will also gradually support higher crude price to minimise its trade deficit
Ultimately oil importers like india will be loser
1961 2018-04-30 19:53:12 Buhari was there looking like a statue while Trump do all the talking. And when place with d question of crude oil buhari said they can tell US what to do whereas US is planning wit Buhari on how they will bring their agricultural produce to Nigeria. Wtf
1962 2018-04-30 19:53:10 Ford announces it will stop making cars: trucks + SUVs only. Also, crude oil prices are at the highest level in more than three years and expected to climb higher, pushing up gasoline prices along the way. #itsfineeverthingsfine
1963 2018-04-30 19:53:04 Call me crazy but I don’t believe in taking pharmaceutical pills for pain UNLESS I absolutely have to. I stick to alternative medicine (thanks to my hoodoo roots), Mary Jane and some good ol cbd oil. Big Pharma will never pimp my system out. Fuck that.
1964 2018-04-30 19:53:03 Liquid and non Liquid (oil and gas)
1965 2018-04-30 19:53:02 How’s the snake oil.. um I mean magic elixir working? You know your response is weak. Let’s get out of our tribes and hold our leaders to a standard equal to the office. Not a reality show.
1966 2018-04-30 19:52:48 Mm, make oil prices rise? Could be true, but that would hurt his base in the US too. Russia's economy is indeed very dependent on oil, but seeing its ally's interests get hurt, esp. in Syria, is another matter. Maybe Trump will need a distraction for his domestic problems.

1969 2018-04-30 19:52:11 That’s okay. B.C doesn’t use or need any dirty oil.
1970 2018-04-30 19:52:09 It’s a huge country and also has lots of oil. Its population is more than half of ours.
1971 2018-04-30 19:52:08 Japan also has great sidewalks and train systems so that people walk more but with reliable public transportation. They spend on infrastructure for people instead of oil companies & their economic bottom lines

1983 2018-04-30 19:50:52 Thumbs Down. Angry. WTF people? Big Oil is raking in Billions, and the prices are up again.
1984 2018-04-30 19:50:35 North and South Korea make peace, Benjamin Netanyahu announces that Iran has a secret Nuclear program. @geraldcelente  says that we better buy Gold/Silver/Bitcoin because if war breaks out Oil and Gold skyrocket to the moon.
1985 2018-04-30 19:50:34 Oh you can bet the tariffs are also directed to Corporate Interest. When farmers go BK (like Trump has so often) but can't pull out  of it, you watch and see how quickly Monsanto jumps all over the bargain prices farms will be going for. Country Oil, Control Food = Control People
1986 2018-04-30 19:50:28 Here is a thought. Why don't you grow a set. And take your country back from all the corruption. How do you think the United States was formed.
1987 2018-04-30 19:50:22 I don't believe Breitbart for one thing. American had these files years ago. You can go on YouTube and find Iranian nuclear facilities everywhere. Trump cancel the deal watch oil prices hit 70 goodbye economy
1988 2018-04-30 19:50:03 Wall Street dipped on Monday afternoon, reversing gains from  earlier in the session, as healthcare stocks slid and investors worried  about rising costs for companies as oil prices rose.
1989 2018-04-30 19:49:55 I stop washing my hair weekly and started washing my hair only on the 1st and 15th. I condition it 2xs a week, I put coconut oil in it everyday. And my hair is becoming a different texture.. God is working.
1990 2018-04-30 19:49:42 Bibi is facing indictment AND Israel discovered a large oil deposit in Golan (Syria) and granted Genie Energy drilling rights. Genie Energy's Advisory Board includes Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch, James Woolsey (former Director CIA), Jacob Rothschild, L. Summers (Clinton, Obama ).
1991 2018-04-30 19:49:41 And Happy Meals cost 18$ And school and hospital bills are free. And a government that sensibly socked all its oil money away.

1998 2018-04-30 19:49:14 I'm not disagreeing that turnover would be good, I'm just saying, there is nothing stopping the next guy in line from getting a blank check for his campaign from an oil company with a promise that when it comes time to vote, their guy will vote in the oil company's favor
1999 2018-04-30 19:48:56 Is America not aware we sell oil? Bring another fault in his visit. Una no dey town? We're diversifying to non oil, Agric and tax. Pdp,  go and start to plant yam, rice, and cassava cos I don't know how you will fund your campaign. Oil money is blocked.
2000 2018-04-30 19:48:55 Tell them to stop using coconut oil on their goddamn popcorn then so I don't die in the theater.

2002 2018-04-30 19:48:47 It's about time he took care of his own country instead of conspiring with Israel to take over as many countries as possible that has oil and gas. He can just STFU. Saudi Arabia has deplorable human rights.
2003 2018-04-30 19:48:46 Present-tense - You currently have 0 proven or 0 probable oil reserves.

Past-tense - You have historically discovered 0 proven and 0 probable oil reserves.  You have generated $0 in revenue to date while wasting a ton of $$$ from poor religious people.
2004 2018-04-30 19:48:45 Baby got oil drippin down her booty crack
2005 2018-04-30 19:48:44 In other news, the criminal faction of the U.S. D.O.D. probably won`t be getting their hands on any favorable deals on #Nigerian oil...not after financing and arming political opposition for decades through the CIA.
2006 2018-04-30 19:48:44 It’s interesting that feminists are not clamoring for less masculinity in the fields of waste disposal, oil drilling and plumbing. They seem quite content to accept the benefits of masculinity when it suits them.
2007 2018-04-30 19:48:38 Does anyone else hate going to get your oil changed as much as me or am I just crazy
2008 2018-04-30 19:48:01 This semester I switched to camomile oil as my only face moisturizer and it’s made my skin better on average/more stable than ever before, helps heal popped zits and all that faster. ik this doesn’t help specifically w /breakouts but it’s srsly changed my face’s life.
2009 2018-04-30 19:48:01 The @EurasiaGroup egX team focuses on a data-driven approach to geopolitical analysis.

To share some of the charts that shape our thinking, each week we'll be sharing "Politics in Pictures" - this week, it's a visual guide to the geopolitics of oil.
2010 2018-04-30 19:47:58 Every day can't be a winning day. We all knew as the economy grew so would price of oil, it's the ebb and flow of capitralism.

2012 2018-04-30 19:47:51 By the way @Dodge why are there 22,000 people waiting on back ordered parts such as the oil cooling housing? 22,000 people should not be on back order especially when they have paid you guys these high ass prices for the pos cars. #somad

2014 2018-04-30 19:47:36 I rather panic about shale, which declines 80% for oil and 60% for gas at an exponential rate.
2015 2018-04-30 19:47:22 Freakin Indonesian Gov are all about the $$. Java, Sumatra, Papua, Timor and every island in between is in a state of destruction all for Palm Oil . The public are the ones who can halt this by demanding Palm Oil is ethically resourced

2017 2018-04-30 19:47:07 US no longer needs much oil. It has a lot in reserve
2018 2018-04-30 19:47:03 Note, works being undertaken on the Lesseru - Lokichar - Amosing Road is maintenance to facilitate transportation of crude oil from Amosing, on the Loichangamatak - Lodwar - Nadapal section, the road is being upgraded to International standard financed by the World Bank & GoK.
2019 2018-04-30 19:46:55 Everyone  knew the Iran "deal" was no deal. Bebe is desperate to keep his oil play in the Golan Heights, but we're not gonna bite. We are tired of these stupid wars. 
Sorry Bebe.
2020 2018-04-30 19:46:51 I STAN SUCH CONTENT! WHAT AN IDEA KISAN OIL HAD WOW! 
2021 2018-04-30 19:46:47 @realDonaldTrump Difficult to fathom why you are so opposed to clean air, technological innovation, economic progress and healthier citizens that you would undo effective regulations that few people, even in industry, oppose. Only industries to benefit are oil and automakers.
2022 2018-04-30 19:46:43 Nope not inventive, just facts. oil will just move by train/truck or it will be produced in other countries with little to no enviro practices. Stopping a pipeline does nothing to stop the use of oil and gas. If you want to reduce pipelines focus on regs that aim at reducing oil
2023 2018-04-30 19:46:41 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2024 2018-04-30 19:46:28 Was waiting for that pinpoint to the penny correction! I was off by .14 thank you. Either way totally criminal to be charging that much for a litre of gas! Especially when sitting on one of the largest oil reserves in the world.
2025 2018-04-30 19:46:12 my car was making noises so i took it to the shop with my grandpa and him and the mechanic just spent 20 mins laughing at me bc it just needed an oil change 
2026 2018-04-30 19:46:09 I did that but I started using cuticle oil and it has helped heal my nails and I always try to keep my hands busy so I stop biting the skin. Try it might help you

2039 2018-04-30 19:44:58 As far as crude oil exports are concerned, Nigeria's most important market is India. Thankfully, India (unlike USA) is resource poor, and it has fast growing economy & a rising population - but it is also close to the oil rich Gulf.
2040 2018-04-30 19:44:44 Yessss just got my oil changed, new transmission fluid, brake pads a few months ago. Now just gotta get it detailed 
2041 2018-04-30 19:44:40 Let us not brush over the impact of the oil fields on Native American lands and people. Crime, drugs, and environmental impacts often hit Tribes harder.

2047 2018-04-30 19:44:02 He didn't need reveal data, already known by authorities, he must think America is not up to snuff on high altitude USAF flights to not know it but he did cause a gasoline/oil pricing crisis to start as his result.

2051 2018-04-30 19:43:42 whizz up some garlic, lemon zest & juice, olive oil and a shit ton of fresh herbs (the kind that are no good dry like mint, dill, tarragon, parsley) and mix that all up with some boiled/steamed new potatoes

You can fry it in a bit of oil together with your other veg and stuff in a stir fry, or it’s great to throw in a chicken broth soup in the last couple of minutes of cooking, but u want it to be a bit crunchy, so don’t boil it for too long.

2109 2018-04-30 19:37:46 Just means our people in the oil field got work. Which means they can put food on their tables. I hate when gas prices are low bc it affects my husband and all those whom are in the oil field & their families

2149 2018-04-30 19:34:09 Niger Delta Militants threaten to blow up oil facilities over budget.

THE ABYSMAL CONSEQUENCES OF A BUCCANISED STATE. SHAME!
2150 2018-04-30 19:33:42 My baby needs an oil change 
2151 2018-04-30 19:33:29 UAE is developing Iran oil with China so war may be curbed yet. The excuse of righteousness for humanity backgrounds all though none voice concern over Sheikha Latifa, monumental abuse of humanity and no WMD bullshit needed to act.
2152 2018-04-30 19:33:25 Douse your front door in Scentsy oil or they'll steal your firstborn son
2153 2018-04-30 19:33:22 This Camilla rose growth serum oil smell good asf
2154 2018-04-30 19:33:11 The glow you get from sunbathing all day in tanning oil is what I love most about being on holiday 
2155 2018-04-30 19:33:08 SOMEONE CHANGE MY CARS OIL OR LET ME KNOW A PLACE THAT WONT CHARGE ME 90$ 
2156 2018-04-30 19:33:04 If you have massive outflows of people fleeing the country, chances are it's a shithole. 
Truth is painful
2157 2018-04-30 19:32:42 私は感想書くの諦め勢です！

二日間ありがとうございました！ちゃんとお話できてよかったです！お菓子ありがとうございました←
2158 2018-04-30 19:32:39 Be nice to think that a tourist boycott of UT could change a few minds here, perhaps just slow the oil/gas development a little. Unfortunately, as can be seen even by the responses here, Utahns don't care much about their scenic wonders and don't like tourists that much either.
2159 2018-04-30 19:32:37 You oil a beard, right? #confused #growsfacialhairlikeaboy
2160 2018-04-30 19:32:31 Learn about my oil today too 
2161 2018-04-30 19:32:19 Is Crude Oil not experiencing a shift to agriculture as our main economic sector anymore?
2162 2018-04-30 19:32:13 Yes, that and enabling Genie Energy (Cheney et al) to drill the oil discovery in Syrian Golan. Israeli-occupied Golan.
2163 2018-04-30 19:32:09 when i made soap i had a scent oil that was in a brown glass bottle with a dropper cap and i loved it!!! it got ruined in the storm tho
2164 2018-04-30 19:32:05 Yo fuck that lol I just spend $200 on my oil change next time I’m doin that shit myself
2165 2018-04-30 19:32:03 Health care stocks, industrials weighing down Wall St., while WTI oil rallies to $68.51/barrel, up +$0.41.
2166 2018-04-30 19:32:02  just a little  . Do you want something greasy & unhealthy that’s thrown together or something made in peanut oil that’s holy & made w love ?
2167 2018-04-30 19:31:57 Good question!but US got what they wanted,oil fields.
2168 2018-04-30 19:31:55 Iran is scared to death that President Trump will pull out of the Iran deal and cut them off from the oil markets, all that shit talking and Bluster wont amount to anything. This is not the Obama Administration
2169 2018-04-30 19:31:41 I think you should have a gentle oil fight.
2170 2018-04-30 19:31:32 so crazy how they believe that by taking away accolades and awards that they gave out, will ever destroy Obamas legacy. 
You all forgot who pulled America back from the brink of financial hell.
he came into mess he left with jobs created, healthcare and oil prices down
2171 2018-04-30 19:31:19 We got more than cornered. Even when the press from Nigeria tried to force the issue, our lame duck presido only commended Trump for his encouragement of Shale Oil exploitation. He didn’t even get an offer to speed up the delivery of the Tucanos to save his life. Photo op trip!
2172 2018-04-30 19:31:12 Ask if you are drilling for oil...
2173 2018-04-30 19:31:05 Kinda like Israel knew where the oil field was located ( Golan Heights) before the confrontations 
2174 2018-04-30 19:31:00 #GrillReady cleaning tip 2/3: Prevent food from sticking by applying a light coat of high-smoking-temperature oil (such as peanut oil or cooking spray) on the grate before turning on the grill.
2175 2018-04-30 19:30:50 I attended a Sanders event in Portland during the last election cycle, and they were also excluding all vape pens / devices because they "might" have CBD oil in them instead of nicotine juice.
2176 2018-04-30 19:30:46 Whip together 2 1/2 pints Danish pastry with 1 cup bisque. Mix in Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve over kale.
2177 2018-04-30 19:30:45 Aye! Wait peppermint ? How did you get a peppermint one that’s discontinued. @CTTYE203 .  I can do unscented(although you can smell the tea tree oil) and barbershop scent and almond vanilla scent
2178 2018-04-30 19:30:35 ...lock her up? That was a good thing. She violated USC 18 2071. Oil spokesman tho..nah, gtfo.

2180 2018-04-30 19:30:32 Excellent question about $0.20/Litre difference in BC. But this guest couldn’t be more of a big oil apologist. Demand in PG will be the same as demand in Lower Mainland.
2181 2018-04-30 19:30:04 Go check out your local @waitrose from today, Beavertoen core range (Neck Oil, Gamma Ray & Lupuloid) being stocked!
2182 2018-04-30 19:29:47 Yes. I have witnessed this first hand in OR and WA. The SS puts a drug sniffing dog at the front of the line and confiscates any loose weed, oil, pipes, etc. They toss it into the trash. Anyone not willing to give up their stash is excluded from the premises.
2183 2018-04-30 19:29:41 Haha, btdt, putting one of those things together is about the worst job I can think of, give me dirt, grease and oil any day........
2184 2018-04-30 19:29:32 BP have never spent more than a few percent of their turnover on renewables - it's always been, and continues to be, more than 90% an oil and gas company. Despite the lovely green sunflower logo...
2185 2018-04-30 19:29:30 So you mistook a fuel leak for an oil leak?
2186 2018-04-30 19:29:25 i just realised again how much i fucking HATE using oil pastels ugh
2187 2018-04-30 19:29:05 Carrot Seed Oil. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
2188 2018-04-30 19:28:52 If oil price/oil demand goes up, I think it would be a war in near future!
2189 2018-04-30 19:28:50 Russia's old Intel laid out plans of what is going on 20 yrs ago. Any country with oil would be advised to hav Nuclear defence. Israel makes out it is a shock and after selling Deep State Genie Syria's fields.
2190 2018-04-30 19:28:44 Guessing he doesn’t subscribe to demand destruction. $300 oil on a $15 gas crack would = $7.50/gallon wholesale pre-tax. Consumers pay $8.00-$9.00/gallon at the pumps. As they say in Vegas, “give me half your $$, I’ll kick you in the nuts and call it a day”.
2191 2018-04-30 19:28:38 A play about an American estate agent’s miraculous healing fluid? The Realtor’s Oil, opening (then closing) soon at the Theatre Royal? #roundpegyouwillgointothatsquarehole
2192 2018-04-30 19:28:28 Biko who is abdulaziz....mbok is he the owner of laziz oil
2193 2018-04-30 19:28:27 They’ve been rising for the past year, and nobody has started talking about it in Politics or the Media. Oil has gotten so expensive that I can only order 50 gallons at a time. I pay COD just to get the best price. I paid just under $3 a gallon last week. So much for tax cuts!
2194 2018-04-30 19:28:21 CEO of kinder Morgan would have called his crony’s at all the oil co’s and asked them to put the squeeze on Vancouver to help push people here. Dead simple. #bcpoli
2195 2018-04-30 19:28:16 Another creative day in the studio ... this time mixing oils and experimenting with cold pressed soap making techniques ... shea butter, olive oil and castor oil this time!
2196 2018-04-30 19:28:14 YALL I HATE BEING AN ADULT cost me like $40 to get the stuff to change my oil. Im dumb mad
2197 2018-04-30 19:28:12 No fried! Fried in oil
2198 2018-04-30 19:28:01 That doesn't matter to trump. He has lived his life taking what he wants for himself, no matter what. In his mind, that money was ours because it was here. Just like the oil he said we should have stolen from the middle east, as the conquering heroes. He. Is. A. Criminal.
2199 2018-04-30 19:27:59 I just use tea tree oil & sometimes witch hazel !! cause my skin is naturally clear
2200 2018-04-30 19:27:53 Olive oil helps a lot!
2201 2018-04-30 19:27:34 I also use black soap 3x a week and witch hazel to control my oil and mattify it
2202 2018-04-30 19:27:31 Great documentary but also very sad to see the demise of the Korowai. The Indonesian government appear to be enticing the Korowai  out of the jungle but offering no alternative source of income whilst they will undoubtedly sell off rights for Timber and Palm oil plantations.
2203 2018-04-30 19:27:27 Because apart from dates, we don’t buy much from them except oil, and when we buy petrol (or anything made of plastic) we don’t get a choice about where the oil came from.
2204 2018-04-30 19:27:25 And here $F Ford just announced they're going all in on trucks and SUVs. 

10 years ago u couldn't sell them and economy cars had a premium with $4 gas.

Oil has nearly tripled in price since early 2016
2205 2018-04-30 19:27:24 And the fuels they get from Washington,  are from refineries that get 40% of their Oil from Alberta  !
2206 2018-04-30 19:27:24 jojoba oil!!
2207 2018-04-30 19:27:20 Wow fuckin joking so wrong what going on here why our country not intervene.     Oil we earn from them
2208 2018-04-30 19:27:08 Oil = Security
2209 2018-04-30 19:27:00 I witnessed a man drink about half a little cup of garlic butter dip and chase it with a small shot glass of olive oil. Is this peak college?
2210 2018-04-30 19:26:54 With oil in Chad, look into the president Idriss Deby and more importantly First Lady Hinda Deby and their control of oil revenues, as well as the absolute monopoly on oil rights by ExxonMobil and Glencore (who bought their stake from Chevron)
2211 2018-04-30 19:26:53 I think he is studying methods of flinging boiling oil over the top
2212 2018-04-30 19:26:48 Urgent Vacancy!
Currently looking to fill an open Supply Chain Management position. The qualified candidate should have btw 8-10 years cognate experience preferably in the oil & gas sector. Interested & qualified candidate should please send their resume to eatuwaogu@hyprops.com.
2213 2018-04-30 19:26:48 More canard.

A criminal will not simply put a $4.00 oil filter on the end of the gun?
2214 2018-04-30 19:26:47 Really? I'm not convinced that is the conclusion we can draw from this. After all, it's easy to refuse funding from large multinational oil/tobacco companies when nobody is offering it in the first place #MuseumHour
2215 2018-04-30 19:26:45 I'm a 61yo,married 43 yrs. I've raised 4 kids, helped raise dozens more.I can paint a room & make a quilt for its bed,change a tire/radiator/oil pump, tile a floor/counter, install a toilet, garden, cook, sew, & read 40+ books a yr. I don't LIE or CHEAT. SHS is NOTHING like me.
2216 2018-04-30 19:26:39 But no, it's to ask if 2 helicopters can be delivered ahead of schedule and how Nigeria will survive if (when) US stops crude oil purchases from us. Too pedestrian, no rigour. Bane of Nigerian (modern) journalism
2217 2018-04-30 19:26:31 See that wicked smile trump be like mumu sign make we come pack una oil
2218 2018-04-30 19:26:25 Ain’t Nothing More Scary Then Driving In A Bay To Get An oil change wat if you don’t line up 
2219 2018-04-30 19:26:11 The YouTube servers mysteriously started leaking oil...
2220 2018-04-30 19:26:05 From what I've seen, you won't ever get "comfy" with them. The UX is similar to driving around an oil truck on fire when the highway is down to 1 lane from 3. Doable, it's easy, but there's still an oil truck on fire right there.
2221 2018-04-30 19:25:34 The intel came to him during a dream where the glory of murder-for-oil in Golan was darkened by clouds of criminal indictment.
2222 2018-04-30 19:25:25 And if I have my way that's never going to change mate. One of the first customers .. of Crush Oil.. . And not planning on going anywhere else.
2223 2018-04-30 19:25:23 Yeah really was.. but then I was left feeling at a loss as to how we even tackle it! The 2nd worst polluter after the oil industry blew me away. 
2224 2018-04-30 19:25:21 That’s exactly the order I went in. That bliss oil pisses me off so much haha
2225 2018-04-30 19:25:18 It’s anywhere. Walmart, CVS, Walgreens etc. it’s an oil. It should be in the section where the supplements and vitamins are
2226 2018-04-30 19:25:09 Tea tree oil seriously fixes everything
2227 2018-04-30 19:24:55 Lots of opportunity for oil exploration in the Arctic sea this year!
2228 2018-04-30 19:24:50 I just remember this guy doing a long spiel about how there’s no such thing as extra virgin olive oil.
2229 2018-04-30 19:24:48 the staff is cluless as ever, making it seem as if it is my fault they were not carrying £3 change and then considering just taking £20 with no apologies for not having change. The  oil on my pizza was seeping out. Not the first time the branch has failed.
2230 2018-04-30 19:24:35 Peppermint oil on your temples helps you relax and not stress while you do homework 
2231 2018-04-30 19:24:30 Spinach, onion, black olives,sauteed on olive oil and garlic with Swiss and Mozeralla.
2232 2018-04-30 19:24:23 What does the Middle East have to offer the western world? Besides oil.... We have tried to help these countries countless times... Only to have our efforts destroyed! Time to make the western world strong again.
2233 2018-04-30 19:24:21 I m seriously addicted to olive oil ! I can drink olive oil straight from the bottle & I need to stop ! 
2234 2018-04-30 19:24:13 Trump just need oil from Nigeria that’s all,He doesn’t care hence they didn’t discuss that statement he made about Africa.
2235 2018-04-30 19:24:10 Yeah Wake Forest plays at Lucas Oil right?
2236 2018-04-30 19:24:04 False.
Suppressors are banned in NYS. No exceptions.
False.
Any idiot can make a suppressor with an oil filter and some duct tape.
Or a pepsi bottle and some duct tape.
Your ban does not stop criminals.
They do not care about suppressors.

Your stance is PURE CANARD.
2237 2018-04-30 19:24:03 biore charcoal wash! it honestly feels so amazing and gets rid of blackheads and cleanses your pores! another product would be the African Black soap bar!! and if your skin feels a lil too dry after washing add like two drops of Vitamin E Oil onto your skin so it stays Hydrated!
2238 2018-04-30 19:24:02 Growth oil
2239 2018-04-30 19:23:51 Gardner’s on Johnston usually do it. I go to get a oil change and go with my windows rolled down and be like oh yeah can you inspect my car haha usually have no issues
2240 2018-04-30 19:23:33 I agree, but there has to be a drive behind the end goal of no oil.
2241 2018-04-30 19:23:31 I bought that amber paste fragrance oil u recommended and sis.... best thing ever
2242 2018-04-30 19:23:05 In honor of National Small Business Week, we are giving a shout out to some of our incredible local businesses! Lee and the crew at Rapid Lube offer oil changes, full sixteen point service inspections, and preventative maintenance.
2243 2018-04-30 19:22:58 the magic touch.... once the message was out... oil price went down..... #stunning
2244 2018-04-30 19:22:57 At the laundry mat and this gruff dude who just sat next to me can ruin my life uugghhhh. 

Arms tatted. Bearded. Definitely a “I don’t do anything with my hair” haircut. Thicc as hell. Covered in dirt and grease and oil. 

I’m   W E T.
2245 2018-04-30 19:22:51 bribery probe into illegal payments to officials at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-owned oil company, and to the then-governing political party.Unlike Telia and Keppel, the Panasonic settlement doesn’t allege actual bribing of a foreign official
2246 2018-04-30 19:22:46 That is a delicious brand of motor oil.

2248 2018-04-30 19:22:23 I have a few cans in my cupboard and some coconut oil as well as solid coconut bars!
2249 2018-04-30 19:22:16 ah, my favorite meal. hard pink sriracha oil and tofu
2250 2018-04-30 19:22:03 Makes me think of some fundraising advice I got once - 'We don't take tobacco money, why would we accept oil sponsorship?' #MuseumHour
2251 2018-04-30 19:22:01 As a nonpartisan, my views go beyond party indoctrination to members. USA can get EVERYTHING in this hemisphere ...Canada, Venezuela, and Mexico have plenty of oil. Canada has diamond, too.
2252 2018-04-30 19:22:00 Just Want To establish credibility, I love with truffle oil Embarrassing my tweets?
2253 2018-04-30 19:21:55 But is it making any difference? Renewable energy is growing. Cars and buses are going electric but not fast enough to keep the oil price rise in check. If only they could drill faster. But US won't since the seven  sisters will make more money with oil at 100.
2254 2018-04-30 19:21:36 Nope. #Millennials are into #progress, intelligence for the #future w their hands-on #revolutions in tech, medicine, energy, civic and social must haves. Old cryptic thieves and liars who hold an Almighty capitalistic god with an AK & a barrel of oil, aren’t qualified. Bye.
2255 2018-04-30 19:21:26 And that’s how they get away with bringing in TFW’s. Post the jobs for min. wage in the most expensive region in Canada and then act all surprised when they don’t get filled by Canadians. It happens all the time in the oil patch.
2256 2018-04-30 19:21:18 Why wait in line  why not have the oil change come to you 
2257 2018-04-30 19:21:07 Fine but again what is China importing from Nigeria aside oil?
2258 2018-04-30 19:21:05 It amazes me that so many people are willing to back corporations that are capeable of gouging consumers for their own gains. There should be a lot more checks put in place to control fuel prices in this country instead of these oil companies dictating the price thry can charge
2259 2018-04-30 19:21:04 The oil sanctions never worked and Babak Zanjani was selling the oil for Ayatollahs. They day after we removed the sanctions , they Iranian regime killed Zanjani, the fall guy who was a 41 old billionaire .
2260 2018-04-30 19:20:42 Thank you Lord for Eucalyptus oil.

2262 2018-04-30 19:20:21 We export leather & crude oil. Import shoes & refined petroleum. Creating jobs in countries that don't want us. Do something lazy youths we need to take our place and the time is now.
2263 2018-04-30 19:20:12 Time to break out the balsamic vinegar and olive oil!
2264 2018-04-30 19:19:59 If yall didnt tell us Happy Charter day no chicken or oil for you 
2265 2018-04-30 19:19:41 I think the war premium began in the low to mid 50s and hasn't stopped. Many factors (hurricanes, opec, long China winter, weak dollar) took oil out of the 30s.

2271 2018-04-30 19:18:35 I didn't read about any "elimination" of bitumen in Line 1. 
There's a sentence that "KM doesn't intend to transport significant amounts of heavy crude oil" with no definition of "intend", or "significant".

Some of increased throughput is due to the faster flow of light oil.
2272 2018-04-30 19:18:33 So USA plans to export agricultural produce to Nigeria. This is a shame on all our leaders who failed to invest in Agriculture but oil. #Trump #Buhari
2273 2018-04-30 19:18:30 "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, exempting the Oklahoma facility from requirements under a federal biofuels law."
2274 2018-04-30 19:18:14 30/4/18 As oil prices pick up @GeorgeKerevan says the answer is the same as it was in 1969- „put the tax revenues into a sovereign wealth fund rather than squander it“ #nationalsnippets
2275 2018-04-30 19:18:13 Only shave every couple weeks; ALWAYS use a fresh razor; splash the area with cold water immediately following the shave and then coconut oil immediately after that. Hope this helps, she did a talk on it a while ago
2276 2018-04-30 19:18:10 I told u guys that the benefits of the oil wealth won't let America and Britain support Biafra.

2282 2018-04-30 19:17:47 My oil change coupons expire today.
2283 2018-04-30 19:17:45 Ah well. Keep yourself off sugar, dairy and oil. And eat only when hungry, not when your mind feels a craving for food.
2284 2018-04-30 19:17:39 ابي طرق استخدام e oil للشعر والبشره عن تجارب شخصيه مو كلام بلوقر+كيف اخلي شعري ويفي تمام ب ليس جوسي ابير  وفيه شي طبيعي(مو كيميائي) احطه عليه يضبطه صح؟
2285 2018-04-30 19:17:36 But certain industries have a business model that is by its nature destructive and unreformable (eg fossil fuels, arms) - even if we imagine that a museum might somehow have a significant influence of the activities of an oil giant...
2286 2018-04-30 19:17:32 THATS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT DRILL FOR OIL SO MUCH

2291 2018-04-30 19:16:56 Value of porn star reputation?
Couch change should cover it.
2292 2018-04-30 19:16:38 Having lived in Nigeria for about 6 years, there are beautiful areas and beautiful, wonderful people...the southeast has been polluted by international oil cos and lovely jungles destroyed
2293 2018-04-30 19:16:30 My buddy has an essential oil for it. And it WORKS. Like. Amazing.
2294 2018-04-30 19:16:29 when it comes to the exorbitant amount of wealth spent on war
do those that ultimately "cash in" on the deaths of soldiers&any1 touched by authorized mass murder-
is there any bit of humanity still within?
R all the politicians that authorized force for oil&contracts satisfied?

2296 2018-04-30 19:16:13 Oil requires sunlight to be constructed, so what's your point?
2297 2018-04-30 19:16:00 damn thing smelled like patchouli oil
2298 2018-04-30 19:16:00 引かなきゃ！！
2299 2018-04-30 19:15:56 I dont see #oil going over ~80$ and thats IF it moves beyond 70$.
Highly doubt it.

2300 2018-04-30 19:15:53 Nope I’m covered in coconut oil.
2301 2018-04-30 19:15:51 I'm not assuming anything. I'm just looking at the price of crude oil futures
2302 2018-04-30 19:15:46 Mix 2 tablespoons venison with 4 1/2 tbsps Italian bread. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Boil. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
2303 2018-04-30 19:15:39 You can put coconut oil in hair.
2304 2018-04-30 19:15:30 We understand your concerns because the protection of the environment comes FIRST!
That's why Canada's O&G industry has the MOST Stringent regulations
It's just a shame that we continue to import foreign oil INTO Canada- imports don't have to meet the same requirements as exports
2305 2018-04-30 19:15:22 Haha exactly! The cleaning oil in that range is really good too!
2306 2018-04-30 19:15:18 Are Trump, Pompeo & Bolton stocking up on military/oil stocks as Netanyahu lies to help aid in march to war w/Iran? WHO ELSE BENEFITS? Eric Prince? Putin? Trump gets his distraction, the neo-cons get to steal more oil & kill muslims. Our GIs & innocents die. Sad.
2307 2018-04-30 19:15:13 While the US has stopped buying our crude oil,PMB is signing for more imports from the US
2308 2018-04-30 19:15:07 shredded boston butt + diced sweet potato + broccoli sauteed in butter with a dash of chili oil. i have created my masterpiece of leftovers. i'll never top this.
2309 2018-04-30 19:15:04 @Garrett_Watts : I’ll go to the flight attendant and say put oil on me  @shanedawson : and she’ll say “it’s already there” #mylife #shanedawsonsnewseries #queen
2310 2018-04-30 19:15:03 Awesome!!!!! Then take one tablespoon pour one cup hot water in it and leave it to the next day. Next day take a Nut milk bag and pour the mixture in (make sure to stir several times w/i 24 hr period) and squeeze it to remove the pulp. This conditionerbis AMAZING! Add 1 T oil.
2311 2018-04-30 19:15:01 Sad news for our oil...and our leaders are not seeing that the future is looking bleak...   but they say we are lazy
2312 2018-04-30 19:14:58 It's not real news! The secret #Fordow uranium enrichment site was discovered in 2013. It led to severe sanctions on #Iran, including an oil embargo and a freeze of State accounts abroad. #IranNuclearDeal dealt with the matter.
2313 2018-04-30 19:14:53 Iran dropped the petrodollar for Euro. EVERY single oil country to do that before was attacked by the US, over reasons of fake WMDs or chemical attacks. Wait for it - dont buy the lie 
2314 2018-04-30 19:14:50 "Both Scotland and Norway have Brent Crude oil so the oil price is the same"
Exctration costs aren't though. 
WTF do you always have to lie by omission?
2315 2018-04-30 19:14:43 The adventure continues, we get the car oil changed and breaks done
2316 2018-04-30 19:14:35 I would disagree that ISIS aren't Islamic they aren't progressive Muslims but they are still Muslims I sat in my hotel in Turkey a few years back watching army helicopters flying injured ISIS fighters into Turkey to then be sent back to keep fighting, because ISIS sold Turkey oil
2317 2018-04-30 19:14:28 Yes... and it's obvious “policing the Water Protectors at Standing Rock” is wrong. As well as, we all look at #Flint and other municipalities where other man made failures are apparent. Plus oil/gas companies whose fracking has left pollution to kill mankind just for profits.
2318 2018-04-30 19:14:27 me tw facewash dekh k khush hogya

2319 2018-04-30 19:14:18 im working on an essay that’s due tomorrow while getting my oil changed, if this isn’t adulting then i don’t know what is
2320 2018-04-30 19:13:49 He probably thinks cannabis and coconut oil cures all diseases
2321 2018-04-30 19:13:49 Like sooner or later the oil won't run out eventually anyway.  It's literally a finite resource.
2322 2018-04-30 19:13:26 All there are here are fried foods man, it's gross. I actually try not to use straws or plastics whenever I can and whenever I remember. As well as I try to remember to make the decision not to get products with palm oil since it contributes to deforestation and is...
2323 2018-04-30 19:13:19 Took that moment to turn off Shepard Smith
2324 2018-04-30 19:13:16 I feel like oil changes should be as fast as the nascar ones. I will do my best to use my platform to make this our truth.
2325 2018-04-30 19:13:13 Sooooo when you get your oil changed they want you to rev your engine, right? That’s all fine and dandy as long as you press the gas and not your brake and embarrass yourself 
2326 2018-04-30 19:13:07 It’s less than alcohol and gambling revenues.  There are more people employed making beer than work in oil too.
2327 2018-04-30 19:12:50 — my family keeps using oil in the bathtub one day — horrible, to cheer me up please send $15 paypal it would be much appreciated

2333 2018-04-30 19:12:01 2.5% for crude oil sales alone; total energy industry contribution is 9.9% GDP in 2016 according to Natural Resources Canada, and that's despite importing 760,000 barrels a day of OPEC oil.
2334 2018-04-30 19:11:55 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2335 2018-04-30 19:11:51 Taxpayers paid for his trip to Morocco with wonderful layover in Paris with woman that got paid but didn't work to talk about who's oil???   Bingo...... wasn't it THAT guy?

2338 2018-04-30 19:11:19 I was amazed when visiting Cyprus a few years ago to see ancient Byzantine handgrenades in a museum. You filled them with oil, so if you used holy oil...
2339 2018-04-30 19:11:11 Save any revealing story's you find as many web site are /may soon be censored bybthis WH.  EPA has eliminated Climate Change from their site because its against Oil& Gas and Evangelicals both who support 45.

2343 2018-04-30 19:10:50 Right now there is a worldwide glut of oil. Tankers are filled circling in the oceans. Putin working with the Kochs and Saudis cut production late last year. Oil prices are being driven by thousands of dark, high speed trades.This is theft of millions.

2351 2018-04-30 19:10:03 I'm fairly convinced that hummus is some of the best stuff on earth. It might look beige and boring in the bowl, but this blend of chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic creates a dip that is so much more than the sum of its parts.

Skip the store-bought stuff…
2352 2018-04-30 19:10:00 UK squandered it and used it to mask the negative impact of deindustrialisation and lack of investment. Both Scotland and Norway have Brent Crude oil so the oil price is the same. Norway didn't deplete its reserves as quickly hence now cheaper to extract. It has better policies.
2353 2018-04-30 19:09:53 Lobbying for oil. Follow the money, oil money.
2354 2018-04-30 19:09:52 Try trs and cbd oil 
2355 2018-04-30 19:09:25 The only answer is to invest in oil stocks.

most ng mga ofw sa middle east  ay nagtratrabaho dun sa mga oil ang gas sectors as mga engineers or mga businessman/woman. pero marami dyan ay mga skilled worker na ang mga trabaho lang na available dito sa

2363 2018-04-30 19:08:29 CNN is back slow walking America to a war with Iran for Israel and Big Oil. Even the supposed Centrist “Democrats” are agreeing with Netanyahu and the Neo Cons again.
2364 2018-04-30 19:07:53 Depends on the mission of each organisation. Can't be a fixed red line for all. Worth noting that oil/arms are only controversial with some people. Others can't understand why there is an issue (i.e. communities where arms/oil company represent biggest local employer) #MuseumHour

2367 2018-04-30 19:07:06 They get a pass because oil
2368 2018-04-30 19:07:02 That's simply not how it works for the EEA countries and they have forced the EU to climb down on issues as well, oil and gas being the large policy areas. In global bodies they decide global standards before they even reach the EU.
2369 2018-04-30 19:07:00 You're smarter than this & know more too.  It's about shifting the economy to us less oil just now, not none. What do you think of public transit and other infrastructure support for other task methods? #cycling #climatechange #canpoli we expect better than trolling from MPs

2376 2018-04-30 19:05:58 Its very clear life of africans don't matter, as long as oil continue flowing to the west.
2377 2018-04-30 19:05:54 My dad just made me go buy motor oil all by myself, so I’m officially a man now right?
2378 2018-04-30 19:05:50 Completely! It is the exportation of refined gasoline (sold at higher prices elsewhere) that drives the cost. Lower prices for oil mean more exports and only a minor reduction in domestic prices.
2379 2018-04-30 19:05:48 shii...difficult than finger picking dodo from hot oil 
2380 2018-04-30 19:05:39 That is a common - and thankfully easily controlled - fungus called powdery mildew.  If you’re ok using fungicide, spray it with Daconil or Bayer Advanced Disease Control for roses. If you prefer organic, try Neem Oil.  Try to keep water off the foliage at night too.
2381 2018-04-30 19:05:35 Wish I could ! But will be using oil for something else to these pics !!

2384 2018-04-30 19:05:10 Vinny’s is jazzin this was back when he was on the Berry’s heavy and dude was running thru the hallways ass naked covered in baby oil I just ain’t wanna but the truth on Twitter 
2385 2018-04-30 19:05:10 Gas is going back up to a buck fifty. Is that good news for Canada's oil industry? I doubt it because the drive for electric cars will go way up. Oil is not Canada's future.
2386 2018-04-30 19:05:07 Some governments serve best as an example of what not to do. When pandering to a special interest group, make sure that your decisions don’t ruin your province. Reality can be a bitch. Between carbon taxes and pipeline protests, BC well on its way to be the first post oil state.
2387 2018-04-30 19:05:04 Not in IBB's interest, because @NGRPresident will make sure that the $12b gulf War oil windfall be investigated and the fund returned. We can understand his fear

2397 2018-04-30 19:04:07 Less oil, better food. Trust me. Dry chicken is still good.
2398 2018-04-30 19:04:07 I just wrote he sold our oil well for $490 million, sitting back and waiting for wailers to run with the story lol
2399 2018-04-30 19:04:05 Also- why is an oil change in Austin $80? I swear in North Carolina I paid all of $30!
2400 2018-04-30 19:03:59 The biofuels quota system and associated waivers have become a fascinating food fight within Trumpland with the TX and OK contingent (Pruitt & Cruz) on the oil side fighting the Iowans (Grassley) on the biofuels side.  Pruitt wins this round.
2401 2018-04-30 19:03:53 Sr Bush was oil.
2402 2018-04-30 19:03:51 Went to the dealership for an oil change... two hours and four daytime talk shows later, I’m still waiting on my car to be finished with its oil change.

2405 2018-04-30 19:03:32 Yeah his account is really gross right now.... shitposting this garbage, holding up Israel as a reliable source of information, promoting propaganda to persuade people to get on board with annihilating two nations that aren't playing by the US banking standards/oil interests
2406 2018-04-30 19:03:10 this trump reason to come and exploit our oil ehn.  if u really want to protect them, Give them visa.

2408 2018-04-30 19:03:02 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=

2416 2018-04-30 19:02:24 Lol I finally got around to changing the oil and things. Cause I got to drive up to Seattle and want to head to Canada soon as well. Then I noticed the tires im like fuck. Haha
2417 2018-04-30 19:02:17 Its a fair observation but unfortunately we spent it on day to day stuff like hospitals, schools etc. Norway got a bit lucky with timing of oil prices and structurally cheaper reserves as well.
2418 2018-04-30 19:02:13 you slap off-white o anything nd it ups it
2419 2018-04-30 19:01:50 I found it interesting that she also doused her body in olive oil every morning, attributing her health to olive oil inside & out. The skin being an organ your body absorbs what you put on it. I’m looking more into that.

2421 2018-04-30 19:01:47 The dealer is a big finesse trust, an oil change takes em 15 mins at most and they charge u for 30 to 25 mins of labor anywAys. The inspection is bs i use to work at a dealer lol
2422 2018-04-30 19:01:45 “Did u discuss the US cutting down on buying ur crude oil for a possible increase”? @MBuhari No. we discussed more importation of our agricultural products to Nigeria..@realDonaldTrump #PMBinDC issoryte
2423 2018-04-30 19:01:41 The U.S. needs Nigeria's oil.
2424 2018-04-30 19:01:41 Or just spray cooking oil over those bars and they'll slide right off.

2429 2018-04-30 19:01:27 Re: the milia, I noticed coconut alkanes is #5 on the list. If coconut oil breaks you out/causes milia, this might be a contributor. Not sure about the absorption issues tho

2445 2018-04-30 18:59:53 Actually the recent rise in our gas costs in BC are not directly related to the cost per barrel of oil, otherwise the cost for gas would be increasing in Washington State and it is not. There was even a news article about the disparity.
2446 2018-04-30 18:59:32 It's not for Trump's hairstyle  but for their oil export.

Thanks
2452 2018-04-30 18:59:00 CBD oil has helped in small doses, as has ending my day with an episode of Bob Ross.

Hard to fall asleep in a shitty mood with that guy in the background.
2453 2018-04-30 18:58:54 Same here, no idea how to handle oil though.

2455 2018-04-30 18:58:30 Bad news for Assad, first since failed coup in Turkey in July '16. Iran deal near to death, sanctions could return, people in Iran are already defiant, supplies and support to Damascus can't go on at this level, Syrian gas /oil still in SDF territory, Russia can't fill the hole
2456 2018-04-30 18:58:19 I think they Louisiana has to sue itself for all the money it collected from those Oil Companies.

2471 2018-04-30 18:56:56 You raise a great question! We also find it suspicious that our government has decided to enter private negotiations with KM

2473 2018-04-30 18:56:39 My friend always said after an oil change check your driveway to make sure your shit ain't leakin'
2474 2018-04-30 18:56:33 The meeting was for a trade deal that satisfy the US and offers little or nothing for Nigeria. US didn't even make commitment to resume purchase of our oil. President Buhari was unable to list one significant of the meeting expect restating an Helicopter deal concluded
2475 2018-04-30 18:56:31 Argan Oil + My Hair = 
2476 2018-04-30 18:56:20 Here's another scary part. People buying into it like they did with Iraq having WMDs. Same old "Intel" story. Different year. Different war. US continues to be pimped out by Oil Cartel and Israel for proxy wars on your dime.

2478 2018-04-30 18:56:06 Haircare routine: literally NOTHING  I wish I had a better answer. The photo on the left was October 2016, it was the last time I cut it. I always let my air dry after the shower & I only curl/iron it once a week. Sometimes I don’t at all & wear it in a bun or natural with oil.
2479 2018-04-30 18:56:00 Dawg idc if my car is on fire I came here for an oil change, nothing else damn 
2480 2018-04-30 18:55:53 Every nigga with me been popping like hot oil or sum.
2481 2018-04-30 18:55:52 We need to be free of  Middle East oil. Oil independence.
2482 2018-04-30 18:55:39 Two reasons,  he sees it as a slight to Israel,  and the odds are it will cause global oil prices to rise. Oil prices rising is a huge need for Putin.  Russian economy is still a mess and oil is the fastest source of income.

2485 2018-04-30 18:55:14 With Vietnam it was for oil & Dow Chemical. With Libya, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, & soon with Iran it is about the banks. As soon as these countries switch from the dollar, we attack. Bring our military home! Enough war.

2495 2018-04-30 18:54:24 I have the firm conviction that the decision taken by Iran to use "currency" other than the dollar as regards the sale of oil is the reason for this play. I would add that any agreements between Russia China India to use their own currencies

2510 2018-04-30 18:52:33 Everyone has lied, why should what some israeli asshole says have had an effect on anything? or right, c-rude oil. Good for you, NWO reptilians.
2511 2018-04-30 18:52:29 Only savages wore pants. The enlightened and civilized Greek man wore a sensible chiton.

2522 2018-04-30 18:51:14 Micro dabs of a high-CBD, low-THC oil. Looks like RSO. So far, so good. I will  tell you how I feel after I attempt to a bland meal and coffee.
2523 2018-04-30 18:51:10 Would love the current rumours about #Safc to be true, but there is no way a Spanish Oil giant is involved in the take over despite the obvious naming rights, the brand has no representation over here
2524 2018-04-30 18:51:04 i have to wait her for my moms car to get an oil change so mutuals talk to me
2525 2018-04-30 18:50:46 As long as it's not oil-based, if you can't get it clean with acetone and/or isopropyl then it probably won't contaminate a new mixture. If it's oil based, idek
2526 2018-04-30 18:50:25 Perhaps Alberta might try deversifying its economy, too. Alberta's Oil Industry only contributes 2.5% to GDP.

2538 2018-04-30 18:48:59 Buhari knows that the US has so much crude of its own. And also oil is becoming nothing. He can’t really do anything about that.

2544 2018-04-30 18:48:13 Analysis
The WTI crude oil and Brendt crude average, will probably be priced around US $ 120, at second semester of 2019, taking into account that said average formed a bottom pattern between September 2017 and December 2014
2545 2018-04-30 18:48:06 The carbon tax does zero to world temperature. It helps other oil & gas producing countries to accelerate their production. 
It is economic genocide for Canada’s producing provinces, penalizes the poor of this country by raising the price of staples & steals indigenous resources!
2546 2018-04-30 18:48:00 @PowerLunch @JackieDeAngelis @MCaruso_Cabrera @MelissaLeeCNBC @SaraEisen @SullyCNBC Funny thing is, even if #Trump signs the #IranNuclearDeal waiver 12May again, despite saying last time was the last, he is also going to threaten it, so sign it or not, #wti/#oil/#brent going up

2562 2018-04-30 18:46:46 Looks ok for a first attempt. That’s homefood for me. The secret is in the high quality of olive oil. When preparing the dough in the pan make small ditches to collect the oil water mixture. Skip the pizza seasoning and go with salt and rosemary.

Trump say we discuss about Agriculture not oil
2576 2018-04-30 18:45:07 genuinely think wwe missed an opportunity not putting bob holly in the oil rumble
2577 2018-04-30 18:45:05 I am 66. I am sick & tired all my life being controlled by OIL. Oil is a Con Job because long ago we have the ability to get rid of oil for most everything. Science Please put effort to end the OIL Companies.
2578 2018-04-30 18:45:02 I saw TRUMP smiling seriously when Buhari was signing  what Trump gave to him I hope is not signing our Oil away .

2582 2018-04-30 18:44:47 Problem is we didn't invade Iraq and totally destroy the country over oil directly. We invaded Iraq I believe because Hussein had threatened to drop the cost of oil and saturate the market, which would have driven down stock values of those super rich, and reducing their wealth.
2583 2018-04-30 18:44:47 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?

2586 2018-04-30 18:44:21 My point is you can't get off fossil fuels completely, solar panels are made with oil and other resources requiring mining, wind turbines are not reliable and again require oil to be produced and maintained.
2587 2018-04-30 18:44:03 I'd prefer a hollow point but bean bag is a start i suppose
2588 2018-04-30 18:44:00 I exfoliate with a coffee/brown sugar scrub. Apply a little aloe Vera gel to my face 1-2x a day and in the spring/summer when it’s hot I moisturize with like a dab of coconut oil because my face gets oily quick which causes pimples and friends

2602 2018-04-30 18:42:34 I didn't tell President Trump to buy our crude oil, we already have steady markets, I told him to invest more in the technological aspect of oil in Nigeria.

2603 2018-04-30 18:42:34 Thanks to @Jenna_Marbles and @juliensolomita podcast for making this 8 hour road trip go faster. Specifically Snake Oil and BS.
2604 2018-04-30 18:42:20 I have a lot of friends who work for Lockheed Martin.

2607 2018-04-30 18:41:41 If Iran's oil is once again allowed to be sold, gasoline prices will drop. Right wing media pushing lies about Iran to make excuses for not lifting sanctions. Iranian oil cuts Koch brother profits.
2608 2018-04-30 18:41:41  well you need to invest in a jar of good quality thumb oil!
2609 2018-04-30 18:41:40 I think the fact that this tweet was put out over an hour ago and it has generated zero interest gives you an indication of current market feelings toward COPL

The company need to get in tune with investor sentiment which is on the floor before celebrating the current oil price
2610 2018-04-30 18:41:38 Journo... Mr President, did you talk to Trump about how America's purchase of Nigerian oil has dropped?

Buhari...I can't tell America what to do

Trump...let me add that we talked about trade & how we can export our Agric products into Nigeria.

Me...Buhari is too dumb. #PmbInDc
2611 2018-04-30 18:41:34 Oh so true, generations of politicians bought out by big oil companies.  Allowed foreign owned and monopolies and few Canadian refineries!
2612 2018-04-30 18:41:33 No big deal. Niger Delta Avengers also collected taxes from businesses especially oil companies in the Niger Delta.

2617 2018-04-30 18:41:06 It means we can go into war sooner and take the oil...
2618 2018-04-30 18:41:06 Gas prices go up it’s a fact of life - oil companies set the prices and change them daily - park the cars on days off....

2626 2018-04-30 18:40:15 One question though - how does agreeing to import America's agricultural products help our diversification plan? I thought agriculture was our next oil.
2627 2018-04-30 18:40:13 You realize that one nuclear warhead launched above our atmosphere would wipe out our automobiles and everything else with electronic circuitry?

2630 2018-04-30 18:39:58 Not sure what that has to do with greedy oil companies raising prices on speculation!
2631 2018-04-30 18:39:47 Gotta put some jerk seasoning on it. Or Lemon Pepper. And pan seared it with some olive oil. Medium heat. Both sides slightly crisp. Leave middle near raw. Let it sit. Salmon is Top 5 dishes.
2632 2018-04-30 18:39:46 I don't know, but I am willing to bet whoever it was is paid a freaking fortune. Tories: easy marks for snake oil salesmen. And may of  you want them negotiating deals on your behalf

2636 2018-04-30 18:39:28 Key difference today vs the past, the US is producing 10+ million barrels/day and rising. The void left by Iranian oil being cut from the global supply will be filled by US exports.
2637 2018-04-30 18:39:27 Don't forget the oil. LOL

2646 2018-04-30 18:38:53 Everyone talking about Buhari that he should ve ask Trump to buy crude.. Just so u know American have crude that could last them for the next 50yrs,with d invention of solar vehicles, electric vehicle etc our oil will become so useless. The world has moved only Africa is backward
2647 2018-04-30 18:38:48 The jiffy lube always does the gander at your engine walk thru thing post oil change. Even though I have no idea what they're talking about, it's reassuring. This place did not but I did save $10 over the JL. So I dunno.

2655 2018-04-30 18:37:52 At least till you sell the Parks & Public Lands to big Gas & Oil or mining.
And BTW ... who are you trying to convince about the impact on small business once you sell off the Parks & Public Lands ... 
yourself, Pruitt or Trump??!?
2656 2018-04-30 18:37:12 Would like to visit Nigeria hears its one beautiful country . Respects our Preszy alot says hes doing an amazing job. They may not buy more oil but open more business opportunities esp Agric related .
2657 2018-04-30 18:37:12 Yea... all that adds up to is like 0.45 cents which is used to build the roads and bridges we use. The remaining lion share $1.15 goes to oil company
2658 2018-04-30 18:37:03 The #EPA @ScottPruittOK has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn.

Oh right they don't have saudi king oil money.
2678 2018-04-30 18:35:20 Yes, that's right, Gaza, & of course the Golan heights suffer the same boon of underground oil. 

Legacy fuels have caused hate, destruction of the entire region since the overthrow of the Ottoman empire, & the dividing up & parcelling out of joint lands into squabbling countries
2679 2018-04-30 18:35:15 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2680 2018-04-30 18:35:11 Oil came off about 60 cents at the end.  The information Netanyahu released isn't new, its been known for years now.  Just political positioning to push Trump to pull Iran deal, even then it won't hurt production me thinks.  Nonetheless, if it happens market won't care in interim
2681 2018-04-30 18:34:50 Assurance @iam_Davido oil de your head 
2682 2018-04-30 18:34:48 Sorry to hear that. I must say some of the only things that have helped me are related to sensory memory (so a peaceful oil blend or a particular smell that can remind me of a less stressful time, sometimes even a certain song). I hope you find your peace soon! 
2683 2018-04-30 18:34:39 With American support there's a chance Boko Haram can be whittled, like ISIS, and that oil money find its way into the economy and People's pockets.

Et voila' no more $h!th01e country...

2687 2018-04-30 18:34:21 I turned the television off. I hope I don't hear later that Trump made the comment " Nobody realizes that Nigeria is an oil rich nation and is actually a member of OPEC, I did because I'm a stable genius, but hardly anyone but me knew this about Nigeria".

2689 2018-04-30 18:34:19 Wouldn’t be oil would it?
2690 2018-04-30 18:34:01 Why should US think of importing Agricultural Produce to Nigeria when we are solidly rich in that aspect. I hope there’s no agreement between them. Just increase the importation of Crude Oil to them.

2696 2018-04-30 18:33:20 Was @MBuhari afraid of @realDonaldTrump or just being modest? What other confirmation do you need to prove that he said your continent is a ****hole??? #Nigeria will not be a dumping ground for #US agri products just as  #Buhari said we can't force them to buy crude oil #period
2697 2018-04-30 18:33:02 She's talking like this because India is dependent on Gulf Oil & Money and how the Leftist Global Network including @UN & Hollywood are protecting Muslim refugees in Europe & Myanmar. If these two factors break then Bal Thackeray's wishes will be fulfilled.
2698 2018-04-30 18:32:45 Look at how Norway manages there oil. Its a Trudeau style NEP!!!!!!!

2700 2018-04-30 18:32:44 A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2701 2018-04-30 18:32:32 You really think oil prices are having a war premium built in & their rise upwards has nothing to do with improving US growth?
2702 2018-04-30 18:32:26 Here is the issue. Syria just official withdrew from both the Petro Dollar & kicked the Rothschild based banks OUT.

When Iraq did the same, they were bombed by Us at the urging of both Israel & Saudi Arabia, both big legacy fuel investors & owners of oil bearing land like Gaza.
2703 2018-04-30 18:32:19 Something that makes sense. 3 Wars are taking place simultaneously to varying HOT degrees at various times. v US; v Israel; v Turkey in Syria @vanessabeeley referencing a colleagues commentary on @21WIRE Sunday interview;  [PeteLavelle interview]. All_4_Oil
2704 2018-04-30 18:32:15 My take. We will sell you military equipment. We couldn't before but I've sorted it. We will sell you agric.  stuff so that US farmers can benefit. No we don't want your oil. We gave you a $1bn last yr and if you behave you will get something this yr. Trump is a great salesman.
2705 2018-04-30 18:32:10 Coconut or cooking oil ?

2712 2018-04-30 18:31:42 @realDonaldTrump The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, his power co does not have to buy energy credits, this is corruption Fix it..
2713 2018-04-30 18:31:40 Not so sure about that. NK has just agreed with SK to pull back. China has been putting NK under a lot of pressure to clean up their act. There's a lot of oil and gas globally now so China can get it elsewhere.
2714 2018-04-30 18:31:31 They suck for that! So ridic! Medical Medium I hope is waking people up about how bad canola oil is. Whole foods must be down with population control #wholefoodsistheilluminati
2715 2018-04-30 18:31:26 They are thieves and need to be stopped! Kinder Morgan is really Imperial Oil and Goldman Sachs! Check it out! Canada can build it's own pipline! That's what the National Energy Program was about. Doing things for ourselves NOT big businesses!
2716 2018-04-30 18:31:23 Bio Oil smells so good urghh
2717 2018-04-30 18:31:19 Before the discovery of crude oil in naija, Agric was what sustained our economy. We did more of export. Now see how @realDonaldTrump Has the interest of his own farmers at heart.

sure add some oil & you got a salad dressing
2719 2018-04-30 18:31:15 @TheRealJoCook: EPA grants ‘financial hardship’ waiver to oil refinery owned by billionaire, Icahn.  It was Icahn who vetted Pruitt for top EPA job at Trump's request. This is what quid pro quo political corruption looks like!

2724 2018-04-30 18:30:52 I could tell Trump was shocked when Buhari responded to the crude oil question. Dude basically said well since you don’t want to sell your market let me sell mine then
2725 2018-04-30 18:30:46 I'm not being sued, DHS arrested me for selling Bitcoin to their undercover agents posing as medical cannabis folks trying to buy a hash oil extraction device with Bitcoin, they found me on @LocalBitcoins to buy Bitcoin to get device. US Fed Gov charging me with money laundering.

2731 2018-04-30 18:30:20 I think it is. Just read some about it. It's got some twisted grain.. coarse and it's not happy with finishes on it. One site just said oil it, as painting and varnish goes flaky.
2732 2018-04-30 18:30:14 Have you tried an oil?

2740 2018-04-30 18:28:51 I think it is all about oil gas and pipe lines
2741 2018-04-30 18:28:48 Cutting out Iranian oil to make it "desperately necessary" to turn to our Russian "friends" for it.
2742 2018-04-30 18:28:44 Anybody else remember #trump saying he'd stop US meddling in other country's affairs and keep us out of foreign wars? I'm betting many #MAGAts and proud #Deplorables are having selective amnesia. I don't support murder, but I'm not too keen on invading oil rich countries #maga

2748 2018-04-30 18:28:22 เมื่อไหรจะวันจันทร์
2749 2018-04-30 18:28:21 I think you are twisting the response and questions, the question that was asked that prompted that answer was buying crude oil from Nigeria. I watched and heard it myself
2750 2018-04-30 18:28:20 Trump called on Nigeria to remove trade barriers to allow the importation of American agricultural produce.  Contentious issue as the Nigerian govt is trying to develop its own agriculture sector to help with mass unemployment + over reliance on oil.
2751 2018-04-30 18:28:08 Benefits of the Petrodollar System. Since the most sought after commodity in the world--oil--is priced in U.S. dollars, the petrodollar helped elevated the greenback as the world's dominant currency. ... Iran pulled away from P$. Bad deal Irán deal.
2752 2018-04-30 18:28:00 #Iran is the final piece of the oil pipeline. Once we invade #Syria we will start a war with Iran. Our Governments will tell us its because of chemical weapons and Nukes but thats just to fool the simple minded. Were gonna take the OIL!!! and conquer because that what we do!
2753 2018-04-30 18:28:00 Government of #Venezuela has offered 30% discount to #India in crude oil prices only if they make the transaction through #Petro coin .

2755 2018-04-30 18:27:54 I think at this point, Iran needs to allow the appropriate authorities to Inspect and verify these areas #Netanyahu claims are nuclear sites before the hawks overreact and get us into another bullshit conflict over oil rich real estate, again.
2756 2018-04-30 18:27:49 @Stphn_Lacey re: call for Energy Gang questions. I’m about to receive my JD and want to enter the energy industry (non oil&gas focused). What does the job market look like for new/recent grads? Where do you see the biggest need for attorneys? Thanks!
2757 2018-04-30 18:27:39 Of course, it is a façade but that is the perception for most Nigerians. They think we are awash with oil money. 

Import of Agric to Nigeria would probably not happen during PMB because that is one thing he keeps showing off so it will be hard to see him kill it off like that.
2758 2018-04-30 18:27:37 @Bin_Hamin @JeffLane22 @THEVinceRusso @TheRealDisco @bWoStevie quite a few ladys and girls in the crowd in saudi..did u notice the ladys all pop when randy orton came out.

2763 2018-04-30 18:27:17 I still can't believe Buhari's response to what he has to do about US reducing their crude oil imports from Nigeria was that he can't tell them what to do.

2766 2018-04-30 18:27:00 I have more insider info than you can imagine.

2773 2018-04-30 18:26:04 Agreed. This is a mistake by Jared. He is judging both the book and Jocko by its cover. Jocko isn’t some fraud like Gorilla Mindset Cernovich selling toxic masculinity snake oil to dweebs. Jocko has a lot of good things to say about leadership and perseverance.
2774 2018-04-30 18:26:00 Crazy.  I would've thought Malibu would be all for it. At least you have some medicinal shops close by. But then, Santa Monica's not that far to go for some weed.    I'm loving what CBD oil is doing for inflammation.

2779 2018-04-30 18:25:28 @ClevePeace @NEOSierraClub against oil (production and consumption), gas, coal & weapons subsidies too.

Small government & low taxation can't just be pathways to corporate taxation- high prices, high rents, lower wages, high profits for monopolies.
2780 2018-04-30 18:25:27 News Flash. TRUMP just had a Moronic Epiphany TRUMP's meeting with the leader of Nigeria. TRUMP's talking about the Wall & N/K again (wander). A new climbing fence. They have so much oil & resources & it goes to the Gov & leader. I smell OIL. Now he's spewing lies on Iran Treaty.
2781 2018-04-30 18:25:25 Hi, Kathy. Hope you had a wonderful Sunday. Wonderful day for us. Beside souls being saved, we paid off the last $100,000 on the church building. It had started out at 7.5 million in 2004. Always great to be debt free. Also had our semi-annual Single Moms Oil Change Saturday.
2782 2018-04-30 18:25:21 I have the olive oil shits again
2783 2018-04-30 18:25:21 You stupid phone! OHL, I typed OHL ten times. I corrected over and over and still you tweet OIL.

I hate you phone!!
2784 2018-04-30 18:25:20 You can’t slick a can of oil
2785 2018-04-30 18:25:16 Who else noticed how our president responded to question about The United States patronizing our crude oil.
#PMBinDC
2786 2018-04-30 18:25:14 Been saying that for months.  That secret phone booth is for arranging his corruption with his oil & gas paymasters.
2787 2018-04-30 18:25:14 Hate? No. Ridicule, for ridiculous positions, sure.

And you haven't answered the question. How is oil, and coal, supposed to have got miles underground in the very, very specific geological layers of rock they are found in???
2788 2018-04-30 18:25:04 Boy, I wish I could get a financial hardship waiver on *my* oil refinery. Guess ya gotta be a billionaire to qualify.
2789 2018-04-30 18:25:01 The one that can't sell oil to America, but can get American agricultural products into his country? Lol.
2790 2018-04-30 18:25:01 USA is now a oil exporter so won't be importing our oil soon.
2791 2018-04-30 18:24:45 It is saddening that the US govt reduced the purchase of crude oil from @NGRPresident,yet the US govt wants to start exporting Agricultural products to Nigeria. #trumpvisit
2792 2018-04-30 18:24:36 I still do not know if rising oil prices are good or bad. Just as I don’t know if rising interest rates are good or bad. Both can be spun either bullish or bearish. I do know when X changes what happens to Y...where Y = EPS est deltas
2793 2018-04-30 18:24:31 The reasons given for invading oil rich countries seem to be less and less convincing these days.

Syria, Yemen and now Iran is a 'legitimate target'?

I wonder if Scotland is next on the hit list for allegedly harbouring Trident nuclear weapons of mass destruction on our soil 
2794 2018-04-30 18:24:24 The EPA granted a "financial hardship waiver" to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former Trump advisor, exempting it from fuel standards that reduce air pollution. The waiver was previously denied by the Obama administration.
2795 2018-04-30 18:24:17 Sorry no time to debate, work is starting to increase in #Alberta....Getting busy out there!!!

2796 2018-04-30 18:24:17 It’s not just about charts. When trump starts tweeting next he can light a torch under oil
2797 2018-04-30 18:24:16 No, it does not contain any resin or oil, it just burns very hot.
2798 2018-04-30 18:23:59 Someone had concerns about the use of bergamot oil. Its use in the scrub is not dangerous, as the dilution of the oil used is so small that you are not applying it directly to the skin, reducing photosensitivity. There is no risk associated w/ bergamot use in my sugar scrub. +
2799 2018-04-30 18:23:48 Is it just normal vape oil?

2806 2018-04-30 18:23:21 If the #oil price is any indication: it went up more than $2 to $75.48 between the announcement of Netanyahu speech until the speech itself. Then it dropped almost $1. The market is still nervous. One thing is clear: some are crying for confrontation with #Iran.
2807 2018-04-30 18:23:12 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
2808 2018-04-30 18:23:12 Dumbest way I ever hurt myself is a toss up between driving right into a light pole (4 inch cut in my forehead) or splashing hot oil on my left arm flipping a pot roast I was browning. Hand sized 3rd degree burn

2812 2018-04-30 18:22:44 President Trump is allowed to bring any topic to the table and Buhari is allowed to do the same thing. My takeaway is that we have to get away from the mindset that portrays us as giant petrol filling station. We are more than oil and should focus on other areas.
2813 2018-04-30 18:22:14 *quiet voice* Lovely sunny day here (soz) So, to go with my cider we have Halloumi and Prosciutto and a sunny salad incorporating feta, chilli oil, avocado, sun-blush toms etc.  Also must have 80's mum's cooking stylee new potatoes dripping in butter and covered in seasalt 
2814 2018-04-30 18:22:10 By the way Carlsbad Cavern National Park is next in line for oil drilling.
2815 2018-04-30 18:22:10 Instead of flooding Nigeria’s food market with subsidized American produce while multi-national corps monopolize large portions of Nigeria’s arable land to produce cheap palm oil, cocoa, and rubber, we should be helping to build sustainable localized food systems. Just a thought.
2816 2018-04-30 18:22:03 I filled my gas tank in the US yesterday it came to $68u.s. Same amount in Canada would be$137! We are getting screwed by the oil companies but especially the governments!
2817 2018-04-30 18:21:57 Canadian companies certainly own oil wells. Federated Cooperatives own a refinery in Regina. It would appear to be more financially efficient to sell oil in one direction and buy in another. But there may be other reason to supply our own market.
2818 2018-04-30 18:21:54 *don't sell. They definitely DON'T sell avocado oil.
2819 2018-04-30 18:21:48 the economy,democracy & ofcourse with Saudi raising oil prices to close 100$ Nigeria had to come in
2820 2018-04-30 18:21:43 not sure whether im gonna burn the midnight oil or just burn myself altogether as well

2822 2018-04-30 18:21:37 The capitalist warmongers are getting ready to move on the Caspian Sea oil fields, a long-term wet dream for the Big Oil mafia. Military bases are already in position throughout the region, so now they are working on the justification to take on both Iran and Russia.
2823 2018-04-30 18:21:30 Enemies getting allies to do leg work for them...as with Oil for Food program the wheels of Iran's nuclear program greased by many so called allies making billions from the cash stolen by Obama from our Treasury...Iran turning "six party talk" scheme used w/ DPRK against us

2825 2018-04-30 18:21:19 Yes, which is why there always need to be a state of war. And people GO TO war for these things, which is also why US doesn't really drill oil in US even though we have plenty of it, we get it cheap from MENA & Global South.
2826 2018-04-30 18:21:17 I am 25 years old. I think my penis has shrunk over the past two months. It has also titled to the left. I am unable to enjoy sex, though I do get aroused by the slightest stimulation. Is there an oil or cream that can help? I also experience pain because of kidney stones.
2827 2018-04-30 18:21:16 @nads1228 @Nikii_bae_7 in two weeks, right about now our feet will be sandy and we’ll smell like tanning oil and that’s the only thing getting me through this week
2828 2018-04-30 18:21:15 Looks like....yes, Bibi......likes war, likes the Saudis too! Imagine that. MIC was a million miles away. Advance knowledge of Bibi speech today - buy oil, sell spx
2829 2018-04-30 18:21:12 The day I’ll be able to tell the mechanic to fix everything they find wrong with my car when I bring it in for a simple oil change is the day I’ll know I’ve made it.

2832 2018-04-30 18:20:55 Well, per God's revelation thru Mark Taylor, that's where the massive supply of oil will come from.
2833 2018-04-30 18:20:51 The powerful & rich are competing in things like "the great game" & economic struggles, but we common people are just pawns they use & manipulate to help them win their competitions, whether economic, war, resources, land, influence, oil. We are just means to their ends, tools.
2834 2018-04-30 18:20:50 Hers another one what happens to all the oil tax revenues ???/ EH answers on a post card addressed to Westminster. The list of monies stolen by WM over 300 years is endless
2835 2018-04-30 18:20:42 A fracking well recoups ALL construction costs in one month of production. And PA will be left with contamination, road wear, air pollution and the raping of our landscape. Oil and gas has millions to lobby with. Tax the hell out of them.
2836 2018-04-30 18:20:35 I prefer cauliflower to popcorn anyway so I'm cool with that  I tend to be very light handed with oil as I'm not a big fan of greasiness.
2837 2018-04-30 18:20:29 Exactly.

Westerners seem to have no genuine clue how much oil & other resources we are gaining from the areas that we devastated by war.

It basically defines the entire Western middle class and bourgeoisie lifestyles.

Without our wars, those lifestyles disappear instantly.
2838 2018-04-30 18:20:11 pretty amazing that oil extraction started bc a bunch of people were like “what if we rub this black rock sludge all over our bodies & try to set it on fire”
2839 2018-04-30 18:20:10 Your president cannot push for the US to buy more Nigerian oil because he can’t them what to do, but he is happy for Trump to say he is looking to push US Agricultural products into Nigeria, despite all the noise on Agriculture being focus for economic growth in Nigeria. Na wah.
2840 2018-04-30 18:20:10 Or, we could stop using oil
2841 2018-04-30 18:20:06 Nigeria has problems and a lot of oil. None better suited  than the United states to step in and cause ultimate caos.
2842 2018-04-30 18:19:58 Game or Thrones:

Macron talks to Rouhani after being at the Whit House last week.

Netanyahu hits back and ramps up with block buster presentation.

Pres Trump to decide but doesn’t want oil to sky rocket.

Saudis to cover Iranian production of new sanctions imposed?

2846 2018-04-30 18:19:29 I ordered four quarts of specialty oil online and got four boxes with 6 quarts each. But that was their error instead.
2847 2018-04-30 18:19:25 So Donny why is the EPA granting a financial hardship waiver to your buddy Carl Icahn the billionaire who own an oil refinery? Blatant Pay-to-Play which you maligned Hillary for! Disgusting ethics once again!
2848 2018-04-30 18:19:18 Oil!

2850 2018-04-30 18:19:00 However, estimate changes occur after some other event has already taken place.  For example, let's use oil.  Oil has been surging on a war talk even though production continues to increase and demand levels of.  If there is no war then oil will crash and surprise all bulls.

2854 2018-04-30 18:18:26 I have my doubts about Nigerian trade surplus with the US. Nigeria’s biggest export to the USA is oil and American oil companies benefit the most. Anything Trump says has to be  viewed skeptically.
2855 2018-04-30 18:18:24 They r minority but follow strict rules of Middle East. Because Indians r excellent workers they can’t afford to loose them. Also conversion business goes on in various south states,  r done through these people by sending oil money.

2857 2018-04-30 18:18:22 Me: Can I please own an article of clothing for more than 12 hours without getting a food-related or oil stain on it?

Universe: That's a hard nope
2858 2018-04-30 18:18:10 Add some MCT oil to it if you really want a brain boost. Onnit has emulsified MCT so the oil mixes without separating from the coffee.
2859 2018-04-30 18:18:07 If we could refine the oil here and lower gases prices I’m all for it. To ship it straight to China so we get Dollarama products back to instantly throw in a landfill, a hard no.
2860 2018-04-30 18:18:02 Cathy, can you stop tweeting about oil prices please! All of this is irrelevant until #COPL sort out what’s going with the #NNPC. As each day passes more and more investors sell out. Arthur has decimated confidence and the share price with his deceit...heads should (sausage) roll

2863 2018-04-30 18:17:55 This is also the reason why the Global North & Capitalist need unstable war torn countries so they can steal, loot, rob oil & other natural resources at rock bottom prices to feed the consumption of global north.

2873 2018-04-30 18:16:55 I read Canada's Mid-century low-GHG development strategy submitted to the UN. I am stunned the Canadian government would release a report internationally that said Canada will completely shut down coal, oil, natural gas in 30 years, except jet fuel.

2880 2018-04-30 18:16:14 It might be where I live too. We don't often get avocados out here and when we do they're pricey. They definitely sell avocado oil at the local store! Haha.
2881 2018-04-30 18:16:10 Sales pitch to international oil major this Wednesday and another one requested an introductory meeting next week. Guess who’s working tomorrow ?

2886 2018-04-30 18:15:45 Mr. Buhari has been extremely incompetent at handling various crises that has led to the death of hundreds of citizens while also incarcerating Zakzaky in defiance to court orders and you come to Washington DC to ask him if he told Donald Trump to buy Nigerian crude oil? 
2887 2018-04-30 18:15:44 And how you going to fuel the generator if you dont want #oil ?
2888 2018-04-30 18:15:41 Price of oil just jumped right in time for US esp. So Cal Memorial Day gas hike - my feeling this is just for Saudi pockets - I'm sure @eshaLegal would know more. Netanyahu makes me so sick.
2889 2018-04-30 18:15:32 I learned these terms, sadly, a few years ago reporting on the Deepwater  oil spill, learning how people were still being exposed to remnant oil trapped in the swash zone years after the spill.
2890 2018-04-30 18:15:30 The snake oil peddlers (Trump propagandists) are now trying to sell the elixir that impulsive, juvenile, smartass tweets from an inept, pathologically lying narcissist is in fact innovative foreign policy and inspired peace negotiation.

Yes Buhari. Stand there and smile.

Nigeria also needs America to use their technology to need our crude oil.

This is a joke whose punchline been lost.
2895 2018-04-30 18:15:07 THIS lefty would like to see Canada's oil refined in Canada for Canadian use. But all the pipelines are sending it out of the country to be refined there and sold back to us.

- President Trump

That’s how you sell your country to the world. Not telling people how most of your youths are sitting and waiting for oil money!
2899 2018-04-30 18:14:48 @CTVpolitics The US benefits all from the relationship, the military hardware/agric products, and Nigeria gets nothing, not even oil sales
2900 2018-04-30 18:14:48 Iraq has a nuclear bomb and Saddam Hussein is going to fire it at the West any day now... Ohh wait sorry it's #Iran this time, #WakeUpAmerica it's lies by #Israel to prompt a war with Iran over its vast oil reserves. #security #Iran #Iraq #Libya
2901 2018-04-30 18:14:47 You mean Iran dropping the USD as its foreign trading currency is putting the squeeze on oil an gold. The war drums just got a little louder.
2902 2018-04-30 18:14:43 Why so we can destroy more of Alberta and the BC coast and still be broke? The pipeline won't bring better royalty prices. Oil production is already at record highs.  TransMountain makes a mockery of any real climate strategy.

WE don't need TM, Industry wants it. Want≠Need
2903 2018-04-30 18:14:38 On the crude oil sale to the US that has reduced, Buhari said you can't tell the US what to do. Sigh

2907 2018-04-30 18:14:22 this reporter is asking if @MBuhari discussed with @realDonaldTrump  on how to increase purchase of crude oil.... what kind of dumbquestion is that...?c
2908 2018-04-30 18:14:20 True. Is it easier to use avocado oil? Has a higher smoke point than olive. But I guess you lose out on the fibre component of the fruit.

2920 2018-04-30 18:13:17 And sadly they have to die to IED's because either the us wants the oil in the area or the CIA needs someone to guard their new poppy fields for making drugs. I'd rather they stay home ready to defend us or our allies.
2921 2018-04-30 18:13:12 You'll be forgiven for thinking @realDonaldTrump got him to sign off Nigeria's remaining oil reserves.

2925 2018-04-30 18:12:48 .@realDonaldTrump POTUS44 gave Iran their OWN money back! It was not USA’s to keep! Have some1 explain it to you. The money belonged to them! They should’ve gotten it back. For some1 who wanted to TAKE Iraq’s oil, KNOW THIS, only thieves  keeps stuff that doesn’t belong to them!

2929 2018-04-30 18:12:36 Mr. Kenney comes from the Harper crew; divisive. Also Kenney took over PCs which had that Tapcal Trust Fund junk. Anti-democratic. My feeling is they are all opportunistic and captive to big oil. Best we change the pol parties at each election. This way they don't go PC entitled.
2930 2018-04-30 18:12:25 Just came to get an oil change done on my car & turns out I need a new tire 
2931 2018-04-30 18:12:20 It goes beyond this for Westerners, though.

Much of our food is imported from extremely low paid farmers.

Our electronics take a massive toll on our environment & exploited miners.

All of our oil, fuel, plastics, etc. Come from war-torn, destabilized areas.

2934 2018-04-30 18:12:05 Sure the oil is physically located in Canada, but that land is owned by foreign corporations who send it out of the country to be refined and sold back to us.  NO refineries in Canada can handle Alberta oil.
2935 2018-04-30 18:12:04 I don't know if it's any healthier but you should try olive oil on pizza instead of marinara

He was asked if he convinced America to purchase more oil from us... He replied, "we cannot tell America what to do"...

2939 2018-04-30 18:11:45 State-owned oil marketing companies like Indian Oil & Hindustan Petroleum have not revised prices of petrol & diesel in the last 7 days.
2940 2018-04-30 18:11:38 Few takeaways from @POTUS 
1) Muslim lives doesn't  matter
2) US is not interested in buying crude oil from Nigeria. 
3). President Trump intends to force US agricultural products on Nigeria.

2947 2018-04-30 18:11:21 And the Press Briefing is done.

For every Q Buhari answers, Trump had to explain in details. PMB can’t explain anything.

On Oil Trade, PMB says - I can’t tell USA what to do. He doesn’t understand Trade. He couldn’t pitch. Trump had to explain theAgricultural trade talk for him

2952 2018-04-30 18:11:11 @seunokin Seun, are you listening to your president? Asked if he can persuade America to continue buying our oil he said he can't tell the US what to do. But lobbyists perfected the sale of the Tukano aircrafts and we paid sharply.
2953 2018-04-30 18:11:06 @Papadonkee @AbangMercy @cchukudebelu Our President went to negotiate for the US to sell their agricultural products to Nigeria. So we end up buying their products yet no deal to get them to buy our crude oil! Who do us this thing? #BuhariMustGo
2954 2018-04-30 18:11:04 In the #USEmpire it's citizens pay taxes primarily so the empire's rulers can attempt to dominate & control as much of the world as possible for their own "interests", which appear to be mostly economic, resources, oil, & our corporations' "interests", which boil down to profit.
2955 2018-04-30 18:11:03 Hydrogen power is a long way off, we’ll still need oil for decades.
2956 2018-04-30 18:10:58 Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia wanted to see prices as high as $100 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: “Friday sees a host of energy ministers from some of the most influential oil producing nations meet in the Saudi city of Jeddah.
2957 2018-04-30 18:10:55 Nigerians una President say una kukuma get buyers of una crude oil so una need America to buy from una. America that’s one of the biggest buyers. Your President issa fooooollll
2958 2018-04-30 18:10:55 i love that shit. in a cheese sarnie. or just cooked in olive oil on brown rice with soy sauce. NOOOMM.
2959 2018-04-30 18:10:48 How would you ask Buhari if he asked Trump to increase the amount of crude oil America imports from Nigeria?  

Nigerian press dey learn work. What kind of question is that ? I’m pissed!
2960 2018-04-30 18:10:29 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
2961 2018-04-30 18:10:24 Don't like @MBuhari response to the question about US not buying crude oil from Nigeria again. I think he should have make a forceful case for patronage. But I think he was more interested in offending Trump. #PMBinDC

2963 2018-04-30 18:10:18 We need a government that’s willing to take on the oil industry and get Canadians back in control of our resources!
2964 2018-04-30 18:10:15 I thought it was about a poor track clean-up after an oil down in your lane.
2965 2018-04-30 18:10:12 Can yal put some oil on the edge of yals frontals? Or will it slide off? Some of yals edges be looking so dry and crusty.
2966 2018-04-30 18:10:09 Waiting for them to get done changing my oil.
2967 2018-04-30 18:10:08 Endless oil story
2968 2018-04-30 18:10:08 Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for you and for your son. For thus says the LORD #God of #Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail.

2973 2018-04-30 18:09:29 “My meeting with Buhari focused mainly on Agriculture and improving American commodity trade with Nigeria. We didn’t talk on oil.” - @realDonaldTrump
#PMBInDC
2974 2018-04-30 18:09:26 About USA increasing their importation of Nigeria crude oil. DT says he discussed with PMB about exporting USA agricultural products to Nigeria. I hope @MBuhari knows that any importation from countries that heavily subsidize their farmers will deal a serious blow to 9ja farmers.
2975 2018-04-30 18:09:25 Tiny bit of oil?
2976 2018-04-30 18:09:08 hahha. yeah cos it has fish oil so they get up in arms if you use milk also cos it's from a cow
2977 2018-04-30 18:09:07 Thank God d youths are not the reasons why America don't purchase our crude oil
2978 2018-04-30 18:09:00 Make sure the oil cap is on - my local almost cost me an engine and is spewed all over #NeverAgain
2979 2018-04-30 18:08:48 No discussion on crude oil input/output between the two country. The discussion is based on agro economy, which could be of benefit to the continent not just Nigeria. 
   #PMBinDC
2980 2018-04-30 18:08:44 Buhari was asked if he pressed trump on buying more of our crude oil and he said he can't press Trump on what to buy! But Trump is giving Nigeria a deadline on aircraft purchase. Buhari is such a fool, a big fool at that.

2983 2018-04-30 18:08:28 Well we know Nethanyahu is a corrupt,murderous piece of shit war criminal that shoots dead unarmed protestors,uses white phosporous on children,ignores UN resolutions,and acts as I$I$'s partner,steals Oil/Gas. Why should anyone listen to that liar?
2984 2018-04-30 18:08:23 But you will hail a govt official that acquires 23 houses abroad and quickly disposes when exposed. You will hail an official that embezzles $3billion in oil deals. You rage over a leader mispronouncing a name. You expose your love of fraud, but the world respects an honest ldr.
2985 2018-04-30 18:08:22 Oil perky as Netanyahu talks about secret Iran plan for nukes
2986 2018-04-30 18:08:09 The #CPC did nothing for ten years on the environment file. Oh yes. They unprotected 1000's of lakes and rivers so folks with oil spills couldn't sue the Gov. or China. That's $cheer's plan. He needs lots of time to make up some more lies!
2987 2018-04-30 18:08:05 Of course more oil is the solution presented by someone working in oil.

2992 2018-04-30 18:07:53 Reporter: President Buhari, did u discuss increasing the exportation of crude oil to US with Trump?

Buhari: No. U can't tell America what to do.
2993 2018-04-30 18:07:50 Are you denying that Trump named a CEO OF EXXON MOBIL as Secretary of State?
Are you denying that Oil has gone from $46 to $75 on a glut of supply?
Are you denying that us going after Iran is causing Oil prices to soar?
Are you denying that we found ZERO WMDs in Iraq?
2994 2018-04-30 18:07:47 Ssssssh don't tell the Scottish people or that there is still oil in Scotland
2995 2018-04-30 18:07:36 No we can't tell the United state what to do..... PMB 

About USA buying crude oil from us.

2996 2018-04-30 18:07:33 When Obama was elected, He came into a mess left by his cousin.
He had to fix that mess and bring America up from some serious financial burdens,but America forgot that because they were promised a wall and a ban
Jobs were up,oil prices down, but that wall, was all they wanted
2997 2018-04-30 18:07:26 Have you tried Cauliflower popcorn? Very good.
-Cut into 1 inch pieces
-Toss with oil

All this  questions....asking if Buhari asked Trump to increase their oil importation...

How would Buhari know that..

3000 2018-04-30 18:07:06 The 9 cents a barrel oil tax dedicated to cleaning frequent OIL SPILLS by industry, will expire at the end of 2018 or sooner. TAXPAYERS will once again be STIFFED for the costs of extensive clean up. Gas prices rising.
3001 2018-04-30 18:06:51 Buhari doesn’t understand what is going on in the oil industry. Shame.

3006 2018-04-30 18:06:32 The oil is never coming back, friend.  Solar and wind are cheaper than ever, the only thing keeping oil viable is countless unintelligable subsidies. Coal is unviable, it is costing us money and only employs 0.00015% of Americans.
3007 2018-04-30 18:06:19 Obama lied?

3012 2018-04-30 18:05:49 LMAO why was there oil already/still in it?
3013 2018-04-30 18:05:24 SASOL (fuel from coal) was developed by our previous RSA government to shield us against rising oil prices. What happened ?? Our fuel price is calculated on Brent Oil prices + lots of taxes. RSA buys oil from Africa and Middle East. The oil price is rising again. Will reach $100.

3018 2018-04-30 18:04:49 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
3019 2018-04-30 18:04:49 ."Yet, drilling into the refuge is just the tip of the iceberg. Trump is aggressively pushing Arctic drilling projects on water and land, sellingoff vast tracts of public lands and oceans, and rolling back drilling safety regulations meant to prevent catastrophic oil spills."

3022 2018-04-30 18:04:36 I switched to an oil serum/moisturizer and it's helped me a lot!! I use it only at night after I wash my face. The cream moisturizers are nice but they wouldn't help my dry skin.

3029 2018-04-30 18:04:15 They sell ONE barrel of oil not in USD, and they will be fucked! That's the only thing they can't do.

3040 2018-04-30 18:02:49 Usually when you insult folks who have worked in the oil industry you tend to come off as looking ignorant. Roy's worked in the industry and he is brave to yap about the junk there. Most of us brainwashed or too afraid to speak about the problems. Roy is bright unlike you.

3060 2018-04-30 18:00:40 Oh, I hear you. Spring is a bitch. When that hefty low pressure rolls in it makes you want to gnaw on the wall. Try CBD oil. I know it works for a lot of people. I vape it. Doesn’t do much for my pain, but it does reduce the anxiety that accompanies it.
3061 2018-04-30 18:00:33 Iran just ditched the dollar for their oil. Typically this means the US attacks them as soon as it can whomp up some excuse/false flag, whatever. Netty is just tryin' to be helpful.

But you may get other expensive failures that may tempt you to get rid. If it's not costing too much I'd say keep till 150k or so.

3077 2018-04-30 17:58:28 I agree with you. KM will lose nothing. They will sue and get their cash. We're going to pay for the entire political romp in the desert. The oil industry is so neat. I'd never realized that all the political parties were puppets to the industry. @OilGasCanada Citizens too afraid
3078 2018-04-30 17:58:27 I ain't smoking NO oil but I'm going vape daddy grace fa my next move looking at the next gen PAX they super tight truss me like NORE trust Pharell
3079 2018-04-30 17:58:21 Disappearing tweets and fake news from bibi, bulls had their day today, tomorrow reality will set in
3080 2018-04-30 17:57:59 Just realised how lucky I was it missed the oil tank! 
3081 2018-04-30 17:57:57 SS should retire to Barbados,and leave the getting oil out to the oil men,he could go fossil hunting on the beach ,after all oil price is flying now

3087 2018-04-30 17:57:07 #Trump you better get #Oil under Control immediately... You want this good Economy to keep going you better get Oil back to the 50 dollar range or say goodbye to ur booming Economy
3088 2018-04-30 17:57:04 Pas pour la majorité des gens, pour la majorité des situations.
Mais c'est la POINTE qui est dimensionnante.
Combien de personnes max ai-je besoin de transporter ?
Quelle distance max ai-je besoin de parcourir ?
Même si c'est une fois de temps en temps, c'est ça qui compte.
3089 2018-04-30 17:57:04 It makes no sense though cause Donnie said he drilled all this new oil and they he told all those stock markets ships sitting off shore to go to port and unload their oil to lower prices.
3090 2018-04-30 17:56:59 We will only get the usual boring you bought the league blah blah oil money  ha ha fuck him we are the best ever

3096 2018-04-30 17:55:33 We all have “negative impacts” Adam. But you can’t compare the destruction from oil & gas with any of the “negative impacts” of solar. That’s a false equivalence and therefore a logical fallacy.
3097 2018-04-30 17:55:31 I’m just reading craigslist missed connections in bed when I should be getting ready for work and getting an oil change 

Oops
3098 2018-04-30 17:55:26 Nothing better than sitting at Panera all day waiting to get your oil changed(:
3099 2018-04-30 17:55:21 on est d'accord, une voiturette suffirait pour la majorité des gens, mais beaucoup de personnes ne voudront pas, car ils diront, c'est bobo, je vais me ridiculiser, etc.. La réussite sociale passe en Fr par la voiture.
3100 2018-04-30 17:55:20 Any reason for oil to jump

3103 2018-04-30 17:55:14 Don't trust Bebe, don't trust the Iranians. Sneaky liars, they deserve each other. 
Huge oil play at stake here. 
Bebe will use dead American GI's to get his way. 
War is not cool with the electorate these days.

3106 2018-04-30 17:54:52  I thought the same, but I'd get cranky if he got all that oil on his back over my bed sheets
3107 2018-04-30 17:54:52 It's all about making it  easier to drill for oil. Can't have those who are raping our land and depleting our natural resources being attacked by bears & wolves, can we?
3108 2018-04-30 17:54:46 That shithole is the 6th largest produce of oil and natural gas in the world.
3109 2018-04-30 17:54:44 Beginning to think corn and carbs have been a bigger problem for this planet and it's people than oil ever was.
3110 2018-04-30 17:54:43 jess......the primer minister of Israel....and the explanation just tank the market and also Oil futures are up........from $45 per barrel to near $65.00 per barrel.......................fill up your gas tank......:0 ................:( ...................bye
3111 2018-04-30 17:54:43 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
3112 2018-04-30 17:54:41 My cousin and I went in together on a hot air (no oil) fryer. Best idea ever.
3113 2018-04-30 17:54:37 Netanyahu has lied before, he will lie again!
He just wants us to fight his wars.
Israel has Nuclear Weapons. They should leave Syria 
& they should stop helping Genie Energy with the illegal 
Oil drilling. Netanyahu should also stop helping ISIS & Al Qaeda.
3114 2018-04-30 17:54:27 this the only reason Pruitt was hired he is a pawn of the oil industry
3115 2018-04-30 17:54:23 Mine used to also! It take a bit for your scalp to get used to not being cleansed everyday, but once it does it stops producing so much oil.

3119 2018-04-30 17:54:19 Leaders from #BP, #Eni, and #Total agree with #Reuters energy analyst @JKempEnergy about the tightening the #crude oil market. What does this mean for exploration and production? Read more about this and other insights in this week's  "Worldwide Refining Business Digest Weekly.e"
3120 2018-04-30 17:54:19 You might be on to something with that ... I have no idea why Iran is considered the biggest threat.  I can only believe it has to do with oil like everything else
3121 2018-04-30 17:54:03 I can't believe how much oil spilt in the Canadian pipeline tragedy of 2019. 

Oh sorry. 

This is a couple of years too soon.
3122 2018-04-30 17:53:59 Trump edhodhi. Loving naija coz it has oil
3123 2018-04-30 17:53:48 Few things are more satisfying to leftist elites than watching others using public transportation.
3124 2018-04-30 17:53:46 Up bec of acid reflux— I drank strong zero and coffee last night, so naturally I woke up bec my stomach couldnt handle it. Currently massaging my tummy with efficascent oil while waiting for the antacids to work. Ah, the lola life.
3125 2018-04-30 17:53:31 He just found it off at the mouth with that or was he again trying to negotiate a point with an opposite side? What kind of oil does you lived in where you get your way just cuz? And again context.
3126 2018-04-30 17:53:31 I've been putting vitamin E oil on my lashes and they have been growing like crazy
3127 2018-04-30 17:53:31 An employee at this oil change place casually used the F word while entering my information into the computer. Should I be concerned for my car or him?
3128 2018-04-30 17:53:26 No wonder @realDonaldTrump is meeting with President Buhuri, Nigeria is the largest oil producer on the African continent and the 6th largest oil producer in the world.
3129 2018-04-30 17:53:25 Le problème c'est qu'on dimensionne un système sur la pointe.
Donc il faut un véhicule qui peut tout faire (y compris partir en vacances en famille...etc).
Sinon il faut plusieurs véhicules, comme le ministre de la transition écologique mais c'est cher.
3130 2018-04-30 17:53:24 80g Gram flour(chickpea flour)
70g Spinach
100ml Water
Pinch of salt
1 Tsp of oil 

I use a hand blender to wiz up the spinach otherwise it can clump up.
Then straight in a non-stick frying pan, cook both sides.
3131 2018-04-30 17:53:20 Pour a few  drops of INJIBS HOT OIL TREATMENT in your  palm, add   a   little sugar    then  rab  around  your face  gently. by   doing this,   you  get  to     exfoliate the  skin  by removing all  the  dead   skin  revealing the     fresh   smoother  beby  skin underneath.
3132 2018-04-30 17:53:07 @_tronIegacy does it tackle oil well ? Always been a battle I don’t seem to win , even in my 30’s x

3135 2018-04-30 17:52:51 INJIBS HOT OIL TREATMENT is very   good  not only to   hair, but also to    soften  facial skin,   hands  and   feet.
3136 2018-04-30 17:52:42 #WTI #CrudeOil #CL_F #OOTT Trump wants the Noble Peace prize at the expense of neocons and the oil lobby.. White House sources say...after North Korea he will meet with the Ayatollah to talk peace
3137 2018-04-30 17:52:31 Well, since you don't live here to experience the absolute destruction that is the NDP, it's pretty easy for you to say that. I didn't like the PCs, but they had enacted the most stringent environmental policies IN THE WORLD for AB oil, so how is that acting as a proxy?
3138 2018-04-30 17:52:27 Way to go, girl
3139 2018-04-30 17:52:26 It's really gripping... Much like motor oil.
3140 2018-04-30 17:52:23 @ConsumerLab 
Please note that Lovaza, Vascepa, and EPAMOVA are not fish oils.  See #goed, #USP, and #pharmacopias that defined #FishOil.  You are causing confusion when you call these #drugs fish oil.  Consumers may think that they can substitute these drugs with #FishOil.
3141 2018-04-30 17:52:22 I find this abit amusing as Australia is a major coal producer and coal, when burned, is a major source of pollution like Carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the primary greenhouse gas produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas).
3142 2018-04-30 17:52:17 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @WhiteHouse What can be done about gas prices...Do you have a plan of attack on how to get oil prices down!! #maga
3143 2018-04-30 17:52:13 Venezuela Offers India Crude Oil On 30% Discount, Only If It Agrees To Pay In Cryptocurrency
3144 2018-04-30 17:52:09 Mais les trajets SONT courts.
C'est ça l'usage quotidien réel des véhicules pour la plupart des gens.
Donc une batterie 10 fois plus petite et donc 10 fois moins chère c'est bon.
3145 2018-04-30 17:52:05 Oil prices, too...
3146 2018-04-30 17:52:00 I don"t believe that for a minute. All Iran has ever been to Netanyahu is cover for a real estate play. For Ahmadinejad regime is served as cover for kleptocracy on a heroic scale. Khomeini supplied oil to Israel via Marc Rich from 1979 til he died
3147 2018-04-30 17:51:59 This one paid though,got his arse whipped with a belt..the baby oil en all
3148 2018-04-30 17:51:52 Sounds like they are giving back to the communities they operate in Just like many oil and gas companies do. Shows how little you understand the industry gives a lot back to communities they operate in
3149 2018-04-30 17:51:47 One finger that touches the palm oil has distributed it to other fingers, people like her are vocal a d expressive but very toxic in the manner and approach! I
3150 2018-04-30 17:51:44 Here in Tuscany you pay not less than 12€ for a very good oil produced locally. The bare minimum being 8-9€ at the supermarket.

You can literally smell a good quality oil. Even police officers who combat food fraud use smell, as chemical analysis can't spot counterfeited oil.
3151 2018-04-30 17:51:36 The  INJIBS HOT OIL TREATMENT is very safe   to   use even  on  children because of  its    natural healing    properties   approved by the   health care   department.
3152 2018-04-30 17:51:36 Why not ask for half of all annual oil industry embezzlements ?
3153 2018-04-30 17:51:34 @Oil_Guns_Merica Just noticed your location now says Pa. I hope you're enjoying it here. Some great hunting here, and (mostly) friendly people.
3154 2018-04-30 17:51:30 He don’t change the oil in his car, what makes you think he give change for you ladies???
3155 2018-04-30 17:51:25 I had a tooth that needed to be taken out asap due to infection underneath. The pain wouldn't go away after tooth removal. Then I read to gargle with coconut oil. Thought it was weird but did it for a minute two times in one day. Pain gone. Mouth healthy and roots great!

3161 2018-04-30 17:51:13 The @EPA has granted a "financial hardship" waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, exempting the Oklahoma facility from requirements under a fed. biofuels law, according to two industry sources briefed on the matter.
3162 2018-04-30 17:51:04 Men's toiletries, gifts and accessories. But not shitty things. Nice beard oil, unusual gifts, braces and bow ties, hats, cufflinks, anything for men that you can't always get. 

It would be called Mr Perfect.
3163 2018-04-30 17:50:50 Those with   straight silky  hair remain   with   an  option of  shampooing INJIBS HOT OIL TREATMENT out due   to the  grease the treatment tends to  leave  behind.
3164 2018-04-30 17:50:29 Si les trajets sont trop courts, c'est trop cher car il y a une location de batterie, même à zéro km dans le mois, on paye.

3166 2018-04-30 17:50:12 Remember to fry up some chorizo then use the oil for grilled cheese.

3169 2018-04-30 17:50:08 The west created your state for its own purposes Mr Netanyahu. You survive there only through its support yet you behave like some major, independent force in the region. They only want the oil, what will you do when its gone?

3171 2018-04-30 17:50:00 I've met several vets who have told me they have even received coaching on how to respond/what to complain about to receive benefits for PTSD.
While I think it went/goes undetected/undertreated for many, it is like many other psych dx, and now overused as a diagnosis

3175 2018-04-30 17:49:53 Me with the basically bread and olive oil you get at nice italian restaurants
3176 2018-04-30 17:49:48 Surgery is like flying a plane. Except you were asked to fly the plane because something is wrong with it. And you need to fix the problem in the air. And every plane is a little different.  And every repair maneuver leaks some oil. And some parts of the pane have poop in them.
3177 2018-04-30 17:49:39 Well isn't that nice? Trump is going to help Nigeria fight terrorism. That's one way to get our military in. I smell another oil war.
3178 2018-04-30 17:49:25 Which war was Bro? US always fought in others land. #WarForProfit it's business to them. Oil, waters, strategic locations. Greed has no limit. And their allies also dance to the tune of the great master #Israel

3180 2018-04-30 17:49:22 Pouring some olive oil into my stiff slidey windows in my new Vancouver apartment to get them to slide better. Never felt so European.

3182 2018-04-30 17:49:19 What I usually get: steamed white rice, with the noodles, broccoli, mushrooms, water chestnuts, with like a few mussels and then they cook it on the grill with olive oil and I get a little sweet and sour sauce.
3183 2018-04-30 17:49:18 They own the oil
3184 2018-04-30 17:49:18 "...but the thesis was that it isn't the similar crash like Texas saw with the oil crash back in the 1980's"

We simply don't know this.  This might still happen.  But I will say there is at least a $30 premium on oil right now.
3185 2018-04-30 17:49:16 Hair is clean and I’m doing a face mask....face masks fix everything, right? Or is that coconut oil?
3186 2018-04-30 17:49:15 Yes girl same!! I’ve been using black Castro oil and that has been helping a lot.. I hope my lashes go back to the way they were before..

3191 2018-04-30 17:48:35 Oil prices say otherwise. We'll find out next week
3192 2018-04-30 17:48:30 Netanyahu is giving up his intel to the world, in order to give @realDonaldTrump an excuse to “blow up” the Iran Nuclear Deal. Iran accounts for ~5% of the worlds oil production. We are at historic inventory lows, and bottlenecks in the US transport train are lmtng supply. #OIL
3193 2018-04-30 17:48:30 The Iran deal being discussed about, crude oil is picking up and you are talking about a meme!. It's really the insane day you promised

3196 2018-04-30 17:48:20 15 years ago I partied with a truck driver in St Lucia it was one hell of a night landing up at a bar on the beach around 3am. He suddenly said he had to leave go & oil his truck. I was confused he then told me he was driving up to jhbg through pongola. Oil was on the outside

3199 2018-04-30 17:47:54 If you want to make predictions about the future of oil, recognise that EVERYTHING is cyclical: 
* investment  
* production growth 
 * consumption growth  
* efficiency/conservation  
* costs 
* prices 
* stocks  
* inventories 
* exploration 
* refining margins
3200 2018-04-30 17:47:48 La plupart des trajets en voiture sont très courts (aller au boulot, faire les courses ...)
Ils seraient faits en mode électrique.
Une petite batterie ( 1/10 des véhicules 100% électriques) suffit
3201 2018-04-30 17:47:41 Gym done, oil changed, front grass mowed and flower beds raked....

Time for a shower, fold some clothes and tweek my dowsing lesson plans.....oh yes... retirement isn't for wimps!
3202 2018-04-30 17:47:27 Oh shit do the oils cause rashes for you? Cause I got some mega bad beard rash and had to shave and I wasn’t sure if it was the trimming or the oil
3203 2018-04-30 17:47:22 Just been next to a couple on the self service checkout in Tesco. Their basket contained: 2 bottles of oil, watermelon slices, whipped cream and strawberry flavoured lube. Almost asked for an invite 
3204 2018-04-30 17:47:20 Apply a generous amount of INJIBS HOT OIL TREATMENT  on hair and   scalp,   massage the oil   generously for ten minutes the   wrap your hair in  a    steaming hot   towel for 15 minutes. This will   help lock in the    moisture.

3207 2018-04-30 17:47:14 This is an embarrassment.The U.S. E P A has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, exempting the Oklahoma facility from requirements under federal biofuels law

3221 2018-04-30 17:46:05 Honestly, was intimidated. But had I lived in a town like Petersville, you bet I would have pulled on the apron like armour and gone into battle with sticky dough and hot oil and luscious chocolate cream. Droool....
3222 2018-04-30 17:46:01 The  olive oil has several  grades depending on  how and   where it was   derived. by taking this  into  concideration, we  usually   take extra   precaution when  selecting which  grade to use when   preparing  our hair   products.
3223 2018-04-30 17:46:00 High oil and gas prices always bad for the present administration. Hmmmm?
3224 2018-04-30 17:45:57 cela réduira un peu la consommation de carburant et davantage la pollution en ville, mais restera très insuffisant pour réduire les émissions de CO2: il faut passer aux véhicules plus légers, voire 2 roues, au covoiturage et transports en commun
3225 2018-04-30 17:45:56 Saudi Arabia thanks Israel for the presentation (false flag), oil embargo against Iran which will limit oil supply in the market further, now we will have to see how much support this new ban on oil imports from Iran gets
3226 2018-04-30 17:45:53 Yup, was in Alaska when Exxon Valdez ran aground, worst oil spill from which the environmental crowd said Prince William Sound would never recover. All fisheries there now healthy, all of them, through nautral process guided by what George Washington called, "The Invisible Hand."

3249 2018-04-30 17:43:55 Do you think the entire neo-con hostility toward Iran is based on one off-the-cuff statement by an earlier Iranian president 10 years ago (which referred to Israel as a Jewish state, not physically destroying Israel)? Not banking, not oil, not control of the region, not power?
3250 2018-04-30 17:43:50 Although with OU and OSU's medical schools losing out permanently on some federal funding, "some oil man gave us money" would be pretty good news.

3263 2018-04-30 17:42:17 I’ve been wondering that for months. Trump said in January he wouldn’t recertify on May 12. Maybe Stormy is a sexier topic.

Not too late to invest in oil stocks.  Remember how this story goes?

3298 2018-04-30 17:39:32 Honestly it’s easier than you think it is. Cooking is kinda hard to fuck up (as long as it’s not burnt). If you add enough salt and use either butter or olive oil it’s going to taste just fine lol. The best way to start is to take something you already know and experiment

3303 2018-04-30 17:39:04 My husband has been screaming about this for months. Policies that are put into play here have driven up oil prices and subsequently gas prices all while we producing more oil than ever before. We will probably unseat Russia as the number #2 producer.
3304 2018-04-30 17:39:03 It's true! Fun fact, it's actually a happy tea too as natural bergamot oil contains alpha-pinene and limonene, which can uplift the spirit and increase an overall sense of well-being!

3342 2018-04-30 17:35:54 Dont tell me is going on another #WMD witch hunt again. If @POTUS @realDonaldTrump wants their oil, hell make a K.A. Deal and TAKE IT. #MondayMotivation
3343 2018-04-30 17:35:53 Half a ton of intel. That's waaaaaay more believable than incubator babies, wmds, gas attacks, 9/11 and so on.  I forgot YELLOW CAKE.  I pity the innocent Iranian citizens about to receive "freedom." Sell oil in dollars or else.
3344 2018-04-30 17:35:46 From your doc: 19T oil -> 5000 gallons of oil. 5000 gallons of oil power 3649.63 homes in Morocco per day. Noor 1 output: 370 GWh / year = 1,013,026.43 kWh/day. Daily morocco home consumes 10kWh/day. Meaning 101302.643 for 5000 gallons + sun instead of 3649.63 with 5000 oil alone
3345 2018-04-30 17:35:40 #Israel has obtained a trove of documents that officials say prove #Iran has misled the world about its nuclear program, without saying how it got the information. Oil prices gained and Israeli stocks dropped after the announcement.
3346 2018-04-30 17:35:32 First shift out on the line and I got to clean up puke, got covered in seal oil/blood, had a passenger arrested, and had a fed on board. I also got to fly planes.
3347 2018-04-30 17:35:25 Dans les graphiques de Fabien, on voit que le soucis c'est d'abord le transport routier. Tout le monde est d'accord pour isoler le logement, mais peu propose pour le transport. La Suède commence à électrifier le transport (caténaires)
3348 2018-04-30 17:35:25 there will be blood absolutely kicked my ass.... had no idea I’d enjoy a movie about white men and oil so much
3349 2018-04-30 17:35:22 @RBIPodcast Lifehacks - save for next edition - store organic peanut butter upside down. This allows the peanut oil to float up into the peanut butter & reduces messy stirring/mixing.
3350 2018-04-30 17:35:22 That's the wrong question. It's not a CTax works at $50 a tonne but not at $45/t but that a CTax should reduce emissions by X tonnes at X price given various other assumptions about economic growth, price of gas/oil, etc. @EcofiscalCanada would be the best place to look for that.
3351 2018-04-30 17:35:06 Netenyahu's stunt sends oil prices spiking and was intended for Trump consumption. Netenyahu wants Trump to kill the Iran deal. 

Iran has been in compliance with the deal, and even this latest stunt doesn't argue otherwise.
3352 2018-04-30 17:34:44 Fight me, naked and dripping in oil
3353 2018-04-30 17:34:31 Needa go get my some oil sheen & just spray that shit all on my edges !

3355 2018-04-30 17:34:15 yep reasons are always silly but was just saying the price is key what story they cook up . and cycle .stories always exist.i read a story today top crude hedge fund manager expects 300 oil in a few years. just they make up stories to justify price push
3356 2018-04-30 17:34:10 Ah yes, that comment is specific to oil prices, what's need for higher levels
3357 2018-04-30 17:34:05 I love using my Jackie aina glow powder for my shoulders since its too dark for my face but I'm gonna dump it in a bottle of body oil today because I really want the fenty body lava but the price hurts me
3358 2018-04-30 17:34:01 We’re like an oil and water, we may have the same characteristics but still we can’t be together.
3359 2018-04-30 17:33:52 @realDonaldTrump please do something about the out of control oil prices!
3360 2018-04-30 17:33:45 Oil change, new tires, inspection, taxes paid, new registration ...aye  thank you Lord

3362 2018-04-30 17:33:22 Good thing I got my oil change before buying the wiper fluid cause they filled it up for meeee. #freestuff
3363 2018-04-30 17:33:22 Saudi Arabia = oil = $$$ and I would have to guess people back Netanyahu because he is in charge of Israel and many people in power are Jewish Americans.
3364 2018-04-30 17:33:19 @AlexRoy144 the small auxiliary petrol dispensers are for the motorcycles. They usually have the two stroke oil mixers there
3365 2018-04-30 17:33:13 If anyone wants to come get from Walmart what would be sick.: oil change is going to be 2 hour wait
3366 2018-04-30 17:33:12 To the asshole who poured motor oil OVER MY FENCE AND ONTO MY DOG: know that you’re an absolute piece of shit and that we will be looking for you.
3367 2018-04-30 17:33:07 May 12th sounds like Oil will be doing well
3368 2018-04-30 17:33:06 Yet USA are the only country to have used them in the past. The West only mingling in ME for oil and everyone knows it. Why not have no nukes at all?
3369 2018-04-30 17:32:52 Anyone know lowcar friendly places for oil changes lol

"Hate each other?"
"Yeah, fair enough. I don't see any reason why not".
3375 2018-04-30 17:32:10 Big question is whether Netanyahu invested in oil this morning (jk). But seriously, if he'd continued speaking for another 10 minutes would WTI have hit $70? #OOTT
3376 2018-04-30 17:32:00 I would get the world's hardest eoc prompt :(

3378 2018-04-30 17:31:47 Most of us born in the late 80s and early 90s kept hearing how chocolates and bananas were rarities during the war and how most family pictures consisted of tapes up windows and oil laps in every room because of late night bombing runs.

3394 2018-04-30 17:30:26 Many in ROC get it. Libs killed Northern Gateway - was a Harper project. TC East was killed to save Que Lib seats. Now they must have KM to restore Alberta economy, so 60% of $20 B ripoff transfers can go to Quebec as usual. & we import $600K worth of unethical oil daily.

3395 2018-04-30 17:30:14 #Crude $oil West Texas Intermediate $WTI is trading at about $68.40 a barrel up 0.84% on Monday.
3396 2018-04-30 17:30:11 Dear believer,

You worth more than oil in a bottle!
3397 2018-04-30 17:30:07 Please Sir Can We Have More. Well I think I've found what Audi used to fit the V10 in the RS6. Came in with a oil temperature fault. To reach and change the sensor it was bumper off and head light out. There isn't a lot of room left in there!! What a car!
3398 2018-04-30 17:29:58 We are hanging on by a thread and the Democratic elite's are pouring oil on it. THEY ARE A DEAD PARTY TO ME! #thirdparty
3399 2018-04-30 17:29:57 Did the Koch boys pay for this dossier on Iran to drive up oil prices,N'yahu is a crook, just like Trump
3400 2018-04-30 17:29:40 That's it. You're putting the coconut oil on me AND THEN after tan hugs. >:3
3401 2018-04-30 17:29:35 That's a really nice polish on it then. Looks wet still. Or did you freshly oil it?
3402 2018-04-30 17:29:31 Looks like Bibi is good for $1 per bbl on Oil
3403 2018-04-30 17:29:26 Israel PM Netanyahu says he will share files on covert Iran nuclear program with international inspectors after already passing them to the US.

Crude oil gains presumably reflect prospect for Middle East supply disruption if Iran sanctions are fully reimposed

#OOTT
3404 2018-04-30 17:29:25 I know they make CBD oil for dogs that has helped in some cases. Thoughts on maybe trying it?
3405 2018-04-30 17:29:12 ok Netanyahu, I going to send you a bill later today....... #forex #trading #oil
3406 2018-04-30 17:29:05 Israel supplies evidence that Iran possessed a weapons program, it has produced thousands of files of Iranian work on developing nuclear payloads on missiles. President Trump will issue a response on Iran Deal #GasPrices #Oil #Energy #Trump #Israel
3407 2018-04-30 17:29:04 Every time that approach has been tried it leads to starvation. Venezuela is having to buy oil from the US, but the next time will work, right?
3408 2018-04-30 17:29:04 Deep breathing, diffusing or applying lavender essential oil, and listening to relaxing music helps. Also, nature is really calming so going for a walk outdoors makes a big difference. Hope this helps and feel better 
3409 2018-04-30 17:29:02 Meanwhile, as American journalists are concerned poor Sarah Huckabee got butt hurt, the #ANWR and entire Arctic circle are about to become one giant oil disaster due to the fool Trump's policies. Anyone care to take that up?
3410 2018-04-30 17:28:56 Oil rigs in Yellowstone doesn't sound too far fetched now does it?
3411 2018-04-30 17:28:56 Yes with increased local crude oil refining capacity,reduced imports from increased agric.capacity for rice etc.,increased local content dev. across major sectors like oil/gas etc..&if we heed Uncle Bill's (Gates) advice & invest in Nigerians. Improved security too. Tall order!
3412 2018-04-30 17:28:54 So, how long before John Bolton persuades Trump to attack Iran? OIL at $100 would be next.
3413 2018-04-30 17:28:54 Ugh I have to get an oil change, here’s hoping the rest of the world doesn’t need the same today, I hate waiting
3414 2018-04-30 17:28:54 I need to go get my oil changed and I need to go to the nailery there is not enough time in a day. 
3415 2018-04-30 17:28:53 I've got a cupboard full of sticky cloths  halve bottles of oil cans of unused paints since I sold the Graco ultra  and generally just a mess . This set should replace it nicely.

3417 2018-04-30 17:28:27 trump will say Nigeria manipulated oil price
3418 2018-04-30 17:28:20 James spends most of his wages on oil of Olay.....
3419 2018-04-30 17:28:17 They can go back to being Service stations. Anyone remember when they used to check the oil, wash your windshield and put air in your tires?
3420 2018-04-30 17:28:16 Oh, goodie. Arctic oil is becoming less cost-prohibitive. 
3421 2018-04-30 17:28:09 Without oil money, you'd be languishing in mid table at best. You've spent the equivalent of the US defence budget over 10yrs and are still irrelevant in Europe. Nobody knows who you are. Stop trying to manufacture rivalries with actual big clubs. Stay in your lane, kid. 
3422 2018-04-30 17:28:06 For Biggest oil deal 2016
And he’s Asshat
3423 2018-04-30 17:28:03 Any country that has a military has oil & sometimes poverty stricken people & super rich people.
3424 2018-04-30 17:28:02 you can take it to a place that you get an oil change at and they’ll change it for like $5-10
3425 2018-04-30 17:28:01 JUST IN: #Israel's Netanyahu says Israel can reveal 'new and conclusive proof' that Iran has been hiding #nuclear weapons activity - #Reuters

Now we destroy Iran.  Trump will own the Middle East and all its oil by 2020

3426 2018-04-30 17:27:59 I love these kind of stocks when we get moves in oil.....this time was weird as we got a big move in oil that was lagged by the stocks. I also like $DVN
3427 2018-04-30 17:27:51 Unionists who are pinning their hopes on oil price staying down may want to look away now.

3437 2018-04-30 17:26:38 2)Next to you condition your hair with the correct balance of moisture and protein for the specific porosity of your individual hair type?Do you add the right amount and combination of OCL( oil, cream, and leave-in)post-shampoo? Making sure u wrap it up at night? I bet you don't.

3443 2018-04-30 17:26:24 When the dollar gets weaker, prices go up. A weak dollar hurts. There is nothing more impactful to the value of a barrel of oil than the value of the USD. The value of the dollar has more weight than demand curves! I've done the math. Analysts that say otherwise are wrong
3444 2018-04-30 17:26:22 Heard the one about how #Iran was free & modern until the CIA & the Queen overthrew their democratically elected President & installed the Ayatollah to maintain control of their oil?
3445 2018-04-30 17:26:20 Oh after siphoning crude from Iraq saying same things now it’s a turn for oil mafia to attack Iran

3449 2018-04-30 17:26:07 1) Your comment shows your ignorance. You are not a woman and particularly one of color. You probably have no inkling of what women have to go through to take care of our hair. Do you do oil treatments to your hair BEFORE you wash it? Then do you pre-poo your hair?
3450 2018-04-30 17:25:56 Get ready for oil companies to experience record settings profits!
3451 2018-04-30 17:25:47 i worked at KC in norwich uk (long time ago) at the time there were only two plants, one in the usa (where the founders are from i think) it was literally quality potatoes sliced up in the roof and slid down to a hot vat of oil..mixed around (by hand) and then into packets. yum!!
3452 2018-04-30 17:25:39 D. Living with kidos forces me to record and edit after most are asleep. Burning the midnight oil.
3453 2018-04-30 17:25:35 Hell, if you’re going to invest the money for a return, invest it in the blockchain space at least. Not into treasury bonds and oil companies. 

Your investors (er, contributors) have already demonstrated a risk tolerance for blockchain tech by investing in your project.
3454 2018-04-30 17:25:30 @fkhanage do you oil your head?
3455 2018-04-30 17:25:14 There are poor countries in Africa without oil infrastructure.

3458 2018-04-30 17:24:59 My favourite oil! Lepas pakai mask suka pakai bio oil. For me dia cepat hilangkan acne scar & keringkan jerawat. Dari sekolah sampai dah tua suka pakai.

3460 2018-04-30 17:24:43 My local health co-op has CBD oil. Maybe that would help. Can't hurt.
3461 2018-04-30 17:24:42 Lesson 2: The prayer offered in faith will make the person well, not the oil...The focus is on faith and not the senses.
3462 2018-04-30 17:24:28 I love motor oil
3463 2018-04-30 17:24:28 I think what he is saying is this is NOT the next leg up on oil, dollar rally has just started. This is geopolitical BS.
3464 2018-04-30 17:24:22 INJIBS HAIR FOOD is hand made by mainly Olive Oil, which is derived from  olives and clinically approved for the effectiveness of Hair  Moisturizing.
3465 2018-04-30 17:24:22 you add bio oil to that mix too? or that’s after?
3466 2018-04-30 17:24:02 Amazon is even delivering right to people's cars now, so maybe they can take the oil right into my gas tank?
3467 2018-04-30 17:24:02 What was this asshole Oil Tanker guy thinking when he decided to go through the under pass. Now all the canal road is blocked
3468 2018-04-30 17:23:54 Fake image.
There isn't any oil painting effect here and one plus camera always has one.@getpeid
3469 2018-04-30 17:23:39 I would like to point out that when an oil refinery in Texas gets taken out by a hurricane our gas goes up but the US gas prices don't. Thats some bull that needs to stopping.
3470 2018-04-30 17:23:34 I thought you meant they didn't have oil in the ground.Don't know any country poor or rich that doesn't use oil.
3471 2018-04-30 17:23:32 I love what I’ve tried! The oil cleanser is fucking amazing. It destroys makeup but it’s super gentle and doesn’t strip the skin

3476 2018-04-30 17:23:04 Just got the oil changed the other day and thank goodness we realized before we got on the road that we were leaking oil.

3479 2018-04-30 17:22:44 Yes, it was abt oil & the petrodollar.  Always abt $/control. 

@realDonaldTrump is transforming America’s relationships with the entire world, centered around economics. 

Carbon fuels will someday be obsolete, much like the nuclear bomb (shhhh, its all abt birds in the sky now)
3480 2018-04-30 17:22:44 Crude oil prices jump 1.7% to $69.34/barrel during Israeli press conference alleging secret Iranian nuclear weapons program. #OOTT
3481 2018-04-30 17:22:37 When an oil company wants to buy your house, it's because there is oil underneath it.
3482 2018-04-30 17:22:29 We need that bump , it’s the citizen that will b stuck with the cleanup tab once the oil companies finish taping n pillaging our environment!!!
3483 2018-04-30 17:22:25 Tuxedo fitting completed. Returns to stores made, oil for truck and car purchased. Taking out meat to thaw for dinner and then starting stream. Sorry for the delay all. Gotta do other stuff for IRL occasionally.

3485 2018-04-30 17:22:14 WOW This Charles Spears comment takes the cake!  Shows how truly moronic and lost so many are.  They have forgotten what their own beloved ones did.  BTW you know it was Obama and Biden, who put Bidens kid and friend in charge of the Oil in Ukraine dum dums.  Not Trump.

3487 2018-04-30 17:21:54 Too bad Canada is importing oil and gas instead of building pipe lines and refineries eh! Oh wait our PM pretends to want this
3488 2018-04-30 17:21:48 I legit cannot contain myself to the final launch info at the oil change which...  you don’t even have to get out of your car for anymore?

Hi.
Can we move a LITTLE BIT so we don’t die? 

WTF.
3489 2018-04-30 17:21:45 thanks Chris and BTW your #PeakProsperity podcasts are among the best around. Not many others discuss finance, oil, precious metals, and urban microfarms :)
3490 2018-04-30 17:21:40 Britain should have conquered Iran back when they were making oil deals with them and setting up oil companies in Iran. Iran was the meeting place during World War II between Stalin Churchill and Roosevelt. They should have known to keep an eye on Iran.
3491 2018-04-30 17:21:38 hate that an oil change for my car cost so much
3492 2018-04-30 17:21:32 I have pretty good skin and I don't deserve it at all. I use cooking oil as a makeup remover. all I can say is drink water.
3493 2018-04-30 17:21:30  - what a snake oil salesman.
3494 2018-04-30 17:21:26 The world is watching @realDonaldTrump 's twitter after that @netanyahu speech. #oil #iran
3495 2018-04-30 17:21:22 Trump really doesn't like the U.S. or her citizens - we don't have enough money, and he only likes those he can get big money out of. That's why he's so partial to other kleptos who robbed their countries, like Putin, and oil plutocrats like whats his name in Saudi Arabia.
3496 2018-04-30 17:21:13 Crude oil prices rush higher as Israel PM Netanyahu speaks:

- Iran lying about nuclear intentions, has secret 'Ahmad' program to develop weapons

- Israel has shared intel with US, which the latter has verified

#OOTT
3497 2018-04-30 17:21:07 Shout out to BBG TV for going to talking heads quite literally while Netanyahu was making comments that are driving oil prices higher 
3498 2018-04-30 17:20:56 Thought it was a genius idea putting coconut oil in my bath but now I’m just a greasy mess sliding all over the place
3499 2018-04-30 17:20:43 Buy oil.
3500 2018-04-30 17:20:43 One hour into work and I’ve already used half of the de-stress aromatherapy oil Danelly gave me. SOS.

3504 2018-04-30 17:20:28 Use half of it as leverage for debt financing my investment properties, use 250k to invest in gold and oil and the remaining 250k seek a start up  which has potential and needs funding
3505 2018-04-30 17:20:22 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails

3507 2018-04-30 17:20:11 No. Oil has been going up even way before the best leader in the words speech.
3508 2018-04-30 17:20:04 Hey @CGilchriese a little bit of baby oil will get those tattoos right off! Or coconut oil. AND hydrate your skin :)
3509 2018-04-30 17:20:03 I emptied out the festool oil and filled my dispenser with Osmo. It worked well the one time I used it . I Always forget I have it and only ever remember once I’ve finished oiling a job.
3510 2018-04-30 17:20:03 Maybe some oil to soothe the throat?
3511 2018-04-30 17:19:49 so oil likes that iran is nuke-happy...

A ver como se nos da mayo!!!!
3513 2018-04-30 17:19:41 Saudi Arabia’s oil resources is exactly why it’s better off than other countries... while there are other factors that effect a group of people’s well-being.. the amount resources available does too.

3519 2018-04-30 17:18:43 The problem with the stagflation argument is this. Let's say oil goes up and stays high (over $80 a barrel) for a year, it acts as a tax on consumers and ultimately is very deflationary. The higher oil goes, the more bullish I become on US long bonds (TLT).
3520 2018-04-30 17:18:34 Their mjolnir covered in holy oil slithered into their puny god’s ass (loki’s butt)
3521 2018-04-30 17:18:29 Yes, sir. Crude oil prices will be steady. Demand will grow in PSF.
3522 2018-04-30 17:18:27 I’ve been wanting a guy who’s not a pretty boy bc they’re so annoying then I get one who’s not and I’m over here trynna make him into a pretty boy, talmbout “I brought you some Argan oil to put in your hair” or “did you wear your wave cap last night?”   LET. ME. STOP. Lmao
3523 2018-04-30 17:18:26 Lmao. Of course, and the amount of bloody oil... do I need to say anything else? 
3524 2018-04-30 17:18:25 Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau now taking questions following Amazon announcement in #Vancouver - talking about gas prices in Vancouver, Trudeau says part of the issue is that Canada is closely connected to what happens in the U.S. "We only have 1 market for our oil exports"

3528 2018-04-30 17:18:03 I read my first "people are starting to get worried about the price of oil" article today!   Im proud of you all
3529 2018-04-30 17:17:57 How often do you change the oil in that thing?
3530 2018-04-30 17:17:51 A transition is necessary and inevitable.  It will run out or kill us first if we keep polluting our air, oceans and soil. And solar is improving to 27/7/365 production at cheaper cost. Even economically it’s the way of the future. And biodegradable “plastic” hemp, oil, cloth,etc
3531 2018-04-30 17:17:51 CNN did an amazing report on this last night. Turley and Mike talking about how it has helped them. Its not about getting high. CBD oil helps pain relief as well as cut down on inflammation. Id rather people doing that then prescribing 40,000 pills in 10 years.
3532 2018-04-30 17:17:48 I support a truly secure national energy grid that won’t run out of power, and is better for our environment, where we live, eat, breathe. The grid built by fossil fuels during the transition must move the marker. Meanwhile, yes, refine the oil we use for jobs. Oil vs dilibit.
3533 2018-04-30 17:17:36 ‘Echos’ lolz.... more like the sound of drilling for oil.
3534 2018-04-30 17:17:27 If God were men he would have been bribed with oil wells and monies to take the life of PMB because all efforts proved abortive

3536 2018-04-30 17:17:14 Again nope it’s not a opinion it’s a fact that oil prices are low and gas prices are high. You are trying to change the subject... I don’t agree with Kenny all the time but blatantly wrong statements need to be called out for what they are
3537 2018-04-30 17:17:12 It must kill you to support oil and gas. Are you a former anti-development protestor ?
3538 2018-04-30 17:17:07 Oil on a tear

3549 2018-04-30 17:16:26 I hope the "bootstrap" crowd notices the government took yours away. What a disgrace. We're really only a few modern military massacres away form blood oil, blood diamonds, etc by apologists definition.
3550 2018-04-30 17:16:25 Not to mention huge uranium deposits in northern sask that we aren’t utilizing. Canada could definitely be nuclear powered if we had the will and ousted the oil lobby.

3553 2018-04-30 17:16:06 Tx so it is more the refining capacity than oil pipeline capacity and price of oil that is causing the higher prices?
3554 2018-04-30 17:16:04 How can u see an oil.?
3555 2018-04-30 17:16:02 Yes, you are correct, it might be more, no one knows, but why estimate, when proper accurate data could be collected, in an Independent Scotland it undoubtably would be better, oil and gas revenues are not included in GERS, also every country runs a deficit, apart from Norway
3556 2018-04-30 17:15:59 my new favorite dish is hungarian caraway soup: heat oil and 2 tbsp caraway seeds in a pot, add 3 tbsp flour to form a roux, add 8 cups water/broth and salt/pepper, peel, quarter, and score an onion and add it and a bunch of parsley to the broth, boil for five or so minutes

3558 2018-04-30 17:15:42 Yes!!! Oil is very bullish with a triangle in hourly chart. Oil doesn't like to stop in round number, for this reason is probably it will higher to 70 before a correction

3561 2018-04-30 17:15:31 Here's an idea. ....lets just get it out of the ground.....we have lots of oil there
3562 2018-04-30 17:15:27 What the hell.why don't city govt put a ban on oil tankers/trucks to pass through canal underpasses. There should be heavy fine for putting other's life in danger, disrupting traffic and creating disturbance. Every other day some tanker is struck in underpass. @CMShehbaz @smucmo
3563 2018-04-30 17:15:25 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation. #CBNDharmaPoratam #APDharmaPoratam #ChandraBabuNaidu

3576 2018-04-30 17:14:05 Was it due to the rail lines being full of oil cars because of environmentalists funded by the federal government?
3577 2018-04-30 17:14:02 Our children will be too sick to work and the oil/ energy Corp will get even richer as they die. There are regulations that can be rolled back but not at the expense of the health of our children. Read the article and do some more research, China is the new consumers.

3604 2018-04-30 17:10:19 US has the refining capacity,  US companies operating in Canada know this, canada could have been independent but have chosen not to.   Canada privatized it’s national oil company,Norway was smarter.

3614 2018-04-30 17:09:06 It should anger you as it's resulted in significant;y less revenue and quicker depletion of reserves. Norway's spending per head is twice that of Scotland's despite having invested all of its oil revenues into an oil fund since 1996. It just chooses to have different policies.
3615 2018-04-30 17:09:04 He has lied, cheated, stolen and used anybody he could along the way. There's always a lot of patsies around for him to fool.

 No reason also to see oil prices jump soon. It is hard to imagine a barrel of oil can ever go as high as USD 125 again.
3617 2018-04-30 17:08:24 Doc what's your take on moringa seed oil?
3618 2018-04-30 17:08:14 Whenever I go get an oil change these dudes have about 50 recommendations for my car
3619 2018-04-30 17:07:46 I have so much coconut oil on my face it’s ridiculous.

3621 2018-04-30 17:07:43 Taxes are the same. What’s changed is the only price is a lot lower. So you should be holding the big oil companies accountable rather than the government.
3622 2018-04-30 17:07:41 Mixing gram flour with water and a touch of oil, then blending in spinach, you can fry it in a pan to make a good Chapati which I like as a good lunch
3623 2018-04-30 17:07:39 Guess I’ll finally get ah oil change
3624 2018-04-30 17:07:27 I'm convinced that any raw food can be automatically improved by seasoning it with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper; wrapping it in foil, and throwing it in the oven.
3625 2018-04-30 17:07:24 Bio oil better
3626 2018-04-30 17:07:24 You have to oil it a lot at the start but over time that drops to around once every 2-3 months, we have quite a large kitchen and it takes less than an hour to do it all
3627 2018-04-30 17:07:22 Just had a dude hmu asking if I wanted “dabs” or “shatter” and I asked whether it was BHO or solventless etc. and he said he didn’t know what that meant. It is 20mf18 how do people like this exist still. PS. The oil looked like it hadn’t been purged even once

Y'know, if you got bored with southwest flavors, you could modify with Asian flavors pretty easily (sesame oil on salad, kimchee soup, pho w/o noodles, etc).

3685 2018-04-30 17:01:03 My friend told me about this one hair product, Mane N’ Tail. She said it makes your hair grow like crazy, but I haven’t gotten to try it yet. Tea tree oil is really good for your scalp, daily and nightly brushing which I’m sure you do. That’s all I got right now lmao

3698 2018-04-30 17:00:15 More Birn: The reality is that [heavy crude oil] can land in many, many places. And for Western Canadian producers, the value is having the tide water access. Because, once it's there, again, it will flow to the highest price point. If Asia can't run it, it'll go somewhere else.
3699 2018-04-30 17:00:10 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference.

There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

3715 2018-04-30 16:58:38 The case study reflects the ultimate corruption by the political power and business cooperates. I don't why there is no system to protect the wildlife and the situation is going worse. The only intention of palm oil industry leaders is making profit from the least investment.

3720 2018-04-30 16:57:46 Nonsense. 5 times more oil is exported than imported. Its a freely traded commodity. The only solution to any imports at all is nationalisation of the sector

Is that what you want?
3721 2018-04-30 16:57:45 Many patent owners preserved their right to appeal under Oil States, but not so many under SAS, Chief Judge Ruschke notes. If FWD issued, parties may have waived SAS issues, "particularly if Oil States was preserved and SAS wasn't." @uspto #SASmes

3723 2018-04-30 16:57:37 Some good came from Oil States.  The US will no longer be in 12th place in the Chamber's report.  The US is now 1st place in the franchise system.

3729 2018-04-30 16:56:14 Not exactly. Oil is a strong case in point. Asset bubble was sufficiently large to destabilize macro econ, as oil is a multi-trill market. These industry recessions were due to a collapse in fundamentals, w/o a collapse in credit/liquidity, as global monetary pol was trending...
3730 2018-04-30 16:55:50 “see i’m nothing like y’all cuz oil n water never mix. it only make sense, i’m talking bout pennies,nickels, dimes. i’m bringing change with every rhyme, my bloodline so divine”

Now ->one gallon of gas is US$185 & a cheeseburger is ~US$175. Teachers are brainwashing kids w/ this crap in America
3747 2018-04-30 16:54:33 We’re addicted to oil, period.
3748 2018-04-30 16:54:14 @realDonaldTrump I have to ask: with #MAGA working so well, why are the oil companies continually raising gas prices? This is another area that has a negative affect on the middle class.
3749 2018-04-30 16:54:04 coconut oil?  Fat bombs?  I've heard of this!

3769 2018-04-30 16:51:23 True, very little heavy oil, but what is shipped just goes on tankers to the US. There is no "tidewater price", otherwise those tankers would already be getting it. So that talking point needs to go away. There is no huge windfall awaiting us overseas.

3804 2018-04-30 16:47:08 Very much, being electrified means more demand for appliances, motor pumps, more demand for electicity will also pump the production of coal and oil n solar plants. But import of cheap chinese goods (electronics) should also be taxed more so as to have a better economic situation

3815 2018-04-30 16:45:36 I think asshole needs to check his facts.  As you suggest A, it was the drop in oil prices that tanked the economy.  NDP are looking to change things so their economy isn't so dependent on the price/sale of oil.

So where is money going? to the badly managed banks to bail out their NPAs, so you invented FRDI bill. Please go away

3847 2018-04-30 16:42:40 Hemp oil/seeds are not cultivated from the marijuana plant, but from the hemp plant. According to Jolene Formene, staff attorney at Drug Policy Alliance, “Hemp seeds are non-psychoactive, meaning that consumers cannot get high by eating them."

3848 2018-04-30 16:42:39 Watched your interview on @realvision trade ideas. fantastic analysis!. Thinking in the stage we're in the business cycle, wouldn't be the pro-cyclical nature for oil's demand some sort of drawback?
3849 2018-04-30 16:42:25 But the paper bills used for currency are the result of trees and 'green'  times when the silk road was accompanied by the Hyksos sheep traders that would light oil to their feet that caught fire.

3855 2018-04-30 16:41:43 Live from the #HoC Oceans Protection Plan prevents large oil tankers/ ships from traversing the BC coast. A North coast tanker ban is popular 79% supported the motion in 2011. Ban prevents creation of pipelines like Enbridge & Kinder Morgan #TransMountain
3856 2018-04-30 16:41:30 Nice word geopolitics. But Big Oil always raises gas prices in summer.
3857 2018-04-30 16:41:22 So shipping oil for money is greed, but shipping lumber for money is okay?

Please pardon my dumb question, I'm still learning.

I checked my oil yesterday, level is ok, *I think* the color is ok, but it has a burning smell on the dipstick and filler cap. Shouldn't need a change for another 1200 miles, but should I do it preemptively?

3881 2018-04-30 16:39:15 @AJNewsGrid Oil prices are mostly driven by near term fears as well as supply issues.  Fear of war with NK, Fear of War with Iran, Venezuela's oil supply is dropping, break the deal with Iran and end of oil from that source..  Lots more fears

3902 2018-04-30 16:37:28 Black castor oil works wonders. The smell overpowers EVERYTHING..SHIAT
3903 2018-04-30 16:37:20 Never understood how oil cos could justify signing those contracts direct with the KRG
3904 2018-04-30 16:37:18 You schilling for the oil corps again James - those taxes pay for infrastructure & health programmes while the $4/gallon goto the corps.

3906 2018-04-30 16:37:13 My daughter started CBD oil to help with her anxiety and depression. It was our hope that it would keep the dose of her pharmaceutical from increasing and increasing as it had been for the last two years.  It has been HUGELY successful for her.
3907 2018-04-30 16:36:55 Jimboman kicking ass on horrible "journalism". I love it. These journalists just repeat what power says in order to gain access and not piss off their bosses.

3914 2018-04-30 16:36:12 Why oil change wait so damn long today
3915 2018-04-30 16:36:11 You need to understand how much people like Bin Laden were motivated by their disgust with the presence of U.S. companies near Mecca. The U.S. has troops in half a dozen Middle East countries, and they most certainly are perceived as infidels helping rulers exploit the oil.

3918 2018-04-30 16:35:53 Absolutely agree. We work every day hard to improve performance and safety daily on a world class project with one of the best teams in the world. That being said the rising oil prices and upcoming big crew change is a valid concern to continue increasing safety performance.

3926 2018-04-30 16:35:10 Return on AIM Resource companies  been pretty weak across the board so far this year, a lot had GREAT runs last year (And subsequent crashes), appetite just isn't there at the moment. A lot of focus else where now ie. OIL AND GAS, PHARMA AND TECH.
3927 2018-04-30 16:34:59 What about in the early 1070's when I think OPEC put an oil embargo ? I vaguely remember this.. In fact, US lowered speed limits, and there was I think that year, daylight savings time to save on oil for furnaces.. Does this come close to that Oil Crisis?

3956 2018-04-30 16:31:27 CRUDE OIL

As a reminder, in 2008 and in 2017 crude oil priced dropped BY SEVENTY TO EIGHTY dollars.

WTI is right now at $68-69, and global inventory are like in 2008 or 2014, or even larger.

Five dollars oil coming.

3958 2018-04-30 16:31:16 RIGHT. it’s a highly comedogenic oil meaning it clogs pores like a bitch. idk why anyone suggests putting it directly on your face

3967 2018-04-30 16:30:01 I'm with Susan on this one Patty. Please elaborate as to how you know he is being played as you claim. Is it because the past several administrations were naive and played? You must know by now Donald Trump does not play by the same rule book as past Administrations.

3973 2018-04-30 16:29:49 Ok South South photographers, it's time to show the world how much damage oil spillage has done in the Niger Delta. Don't forget the Soot. I know it's not the kind of beauty the world wants to see but it's the kind they need to see.
So grab your Cameras.
3974 2018-04-30 16:29:44 Yes I agree, including the ones they passed on a marathon race. Baba, you and I are still here, the truth shall protect itself when let loose. Enjoy your ride
3975 2018-04-30 16:29:31 $300 for a barrel of oil is highly possible when a major war erupts in the Middle-East.
3976 2018-04-30 16:29:28 Scary reading the support comments.  People don't have a clue how pipelines work, people don't understand oil production and processing and economics, don't understand environment regulations, don't understand the critical role of CO2 for life, etc. All pretending to be experts!
3977 2018-04-30 16:29:22 That's the reason why you think the US UK Saudi Arabia AND France would want to invade Iran? Lmao. Think oil/gas.
3978 2018-04-30 16:29:12 Did the aide have to be covered in oil, light the Great Phallic Candle of Loyalty & learn the secret handshake? 

Or was that optional----?
3979 2018-04-30 16:29:04 Hey Sheila, do you have a list of all the staff NDP hired that was “from BC” (& elsewhere) that wouldn’t understand Alberta’s farmers, oil & gas cycles & have/have-not status?

3981 2018-04-30 16:28:59 I will only use a mat if I am framing art on paper. If it's oil or acrylic, I try like hell to never use a mat. It cheapens it imho.
As for frames - depends on your house. Do you have a ton of wood antiques? Do you have a lot of metal/modern? Look around first.
3982 2018-04-30 16:28:59 Respectfully, would rather an NDP in Alberta; still much better than the Conservative government which served as little more then a proxy for the oil industry. That much was obvious.

3987 2018-04-30 16:28:09 Oil is at 67ish a barrel which is not much different. Could it be refining capacity?
3988 2018-04-30 16:27:56 Defo. 

If you don’t want the palm oily taste, bleach the palm oil covered for like 8 minutes - like you’re trying to cook Ayamashe, then fry.

4031 2018-04-30 16:23:48 @mitchellreports Andrea, Trump is ramping up oil leases in the Artic. Where clean up & controling spill would be impossible. Hear is another example incompetence. This is all about billionaires in oil industry. Is this going to MAGA. No it’s going to harm the fishing industry
4032 2018-04-30 16:23:44 Guatemala 1954 coup, CIA financed and backed, at the request of the United Fruit Company
Chile 1973 coup, CIA backed and financed when president Allende natinalised the copper mines to use that wealth to invest in his own country
Iran 1953 coup, UK and US, over nationalised oil
4033 2018-04-30 16:23:42 OPEC reducing oil being pumped, to raise gas prices through the summer I guess making billions a day isn't enough.

4036 2018-04-30 16:23:21 @realDonaldTrump stopthecaravancrossings

Place water cannons at the strategic crossing points and mix a small amount of oil and pepper into the water. Slippery walls and watery, burning eyes will stop the progress without permanent injury.
4037 2018-04-30 16:23:19 As long as you can handle the amount of olive oil it calls for, it is. And not difficult either.
4038 2018-04-30 16:23:13 He changes his mind every day. Is he now long QQQ? Or long oil?

this is some spongebob shit
4045 2018-04-30 16:22:14 There’s some truth to that.  Having a strategic interest in the free trade of oil is far different than occupying & controlling a foreign nations oil supply...which was implied.

4057 2018-04-30 16:21:08 bitterness occurs with certain strong olive oils (polyphenol dispersed), but if a partial neutral oil is used, it may negate that and evoo added after blend w basil. Also pesto is pretty strong, not sure that minimal bitterness will even come up...
4058 2018-04-30 16:20:59 Just remember, 95 percent of your oil money plastic fan base can't name a player before 2005, go cry over your bus

4062 2018-04-30 16:20:42 @jakejakeny I would not count on that.  One major consequence of the Iran Deal is that Iran now has the means to manufacture and acquire more armaments.  Rising oil prices have also contributed to this.
4063 2018-04-30 16:20:38 I think we're on the same pg. I'm not making a statement about Oil States either. It did attract an inordinate amount of attention and with it a whole lot of armchair QBing and predictions about the future. Mostly USA #patent life as we know it is over. Which I beg to differ on.
4064 2018-04-30 16:20:36 I hate getting oil changes cause they inspect my whole car and I always need new filters LOL. I bet they’re like where’s this bitch going that her filters are this bad 
4065 2018-04-30 16:20:26 Whilst Trump brokers peace and nuclear disarmament in Korea he is doing the exact opposite in the Middle East....he clearly wants the oil price higher
4066 2018-04-30 16:20:14 I bought a diffuser for my desk at work that I've been SUPER excited to use. This weekend I made a lavender and peppermint essential oil mix especially for it. Only to get to work and discover the diffuser is broken. *womp womp*
4067 2018-04-30 16:19:56 And no oil companies saw this on their future?  No long term capital plans?  Maybe they did, but realized that there was more profit in controlling supply?
4068 2018-04-30 16:19:55 My friend worked at a bar where they served some fried foods like wings, fries, mozerellla cheese sticks, etc....

They never changed the oil in the fryer, a huge fryer btw that took like an hour to heat up... So if some poor idiot ordered food, it would take like 2 hours if ever
4069 2018-04-30 16:19:47 US oil demand was up 460kbpd or 2.4% y/y to 19.619mbpd in February

4083 2018-04-30 16:18:39 Congratulations Thomas! Nigeria possibly is a better test case data permitting. Small open economy with high export and fiscal dependency on oil though its share in output is small. Throw in nominal FX rate targeting. And we are so vulnerable to boom and bust cycles.

4140 2018-04-30 16:13:01 Who says this stuff? Fine to import oil from anywhere else; Iraq, Saudi Arabia; uAE, etc.; where there is an extremely low frequency if spill; pay a huge premium, raise our taxes, etc. Arrogant, naive, small minded people who will drive BC into huge debt. For their children.

4154 2018-04-30 16:11:05 Isn't one of the reasons to justify fracking and ramping up domestic pill production that it would drive down prices? Or maybe it's naive to take the word of oil companies and the politicians they lobby.

4163 2018-04-30 16:10:16 Well one is a free thinker and one reads bullet points written by CNN. Oil doesn't mix with water.
4164 2018-04-30 16:10:15 Bunch of Snake Oil Salesmen if you ask me. But I realize you didn’t.
4165 2018-04-30 16:10:12 Oh my gosh, this is *so* you.  Funny story, drove to VA with CBD oil.  Bro saw the bottle and informed us it was illegal in VA.  Oh snap!
4166 2018-04-30 16:10:10 Using stearin does mean that the melt point is raised, so we add coconut oil to counter that, and keep the candles within a safe range for play. The addition of the dyes does not adversely affect or raise the melt point into dangerous levels.

4182 2018-04-30 16:08:54 We just need to take coconut oil and oregano oil instead.
4183 2018-04-30 16:08:50 Unless you have oily skin, you only need to wash your face in the evening, with a creamy cleanser and lukewarm water. Give the cleanser time to work. Instead of scrubbing your face, let the cleanser sit on your skin for several seconds and break down the makeup, dirt, and oil.
4184 2018-04-30 16:08:47 It’s odd when there’s a conflict in the Middle East gas $ goes up(it has no effect on us), there’s a pipeline explosion or BHP incident and our price goes up. Essentially whenever there is an excuse to raise $oil co’s do.  That said when all is good they are slow to decrease it
4185 2018-04-30 16:08:44 Why is this cactus leaking oil??
4186 2018-04-30 16:08:40 I'd argue that governments have -- at least so far -- focused almost exclusively on demand-side policy for both coal and oil and gas, no? Only exception is the GHG limit on oilsands in Alberta.

4196 2018-04-30 16:07:04 Not directly, but oil is the only reason U.S. has a military presence in Middle East, and private business has a major stake. CIA has been excessively influenced in their recommendations by "what is good for oil imports to U S.?"
4197 2018-04-30 16:06:59 The article states that air pollutant concentrations increased with proximity to an oil and gas facility. If you have additional questions about the article, you can reach out to the author at david.kelly@ucdenver.edu.

4199 2018-04-30 16:06:40 I think it's important for kinksters to ask the vendor from whom they purchased their candles, what the candles contain, if they have any concerns at all about suitability.
Ours are a blend of vegetable wax, coconut oil and a small amount of stearin.

4225 2018-04-30 16:04:28 There has been a decrease in emissions attributable to the carbon tax, relative to what would have otherwise been the case. And some studies even show a carbon tax salience effect where effect of carbon price > effect of same increase due to oil prices. Next red herring?

4265 2018-04-30 16:00:14 Oil didn’t initially move on the headline. 

It moved when Israel said it was closing its airspace near the Syrian border.

4276 2018-04-30 15:59:30 In one breath Transmountain pipeline advocates are saying it is needed so that we can sell our oil to the Far East for more money than we sell it to the US, and then in the next breath they say the pipeline is needed for domestic consumption and reducing imports.

The whole premise of the tax is to make it so difficult to pay to use oil/gas dependent products (cars,furnaces,etc.) that we reduce our use and thereby consumption. It’s a punishment

4298 2018-04-30 15:57:01 Most people like dip brow cos it looks so good but any pomade waxy substance for brows can damage them. I’ve seen so many of my clients lose hair and have gaps because when they remove their makeup they aren’t careful and don’t use an oil based remover

4300 2018-04-30 15:57:00 The data is quite astonishing to me. Do we have any right to explode the depletion of this race? What is the reason behind the vast investment in palm oil industry?Can't we replace palm oil?Is that essential for our secured life?Yes I know these are all human's greed for money!!!
4301 2018-04-30 15:56:58 Yes That was supposed to say oil in it lol sorry 
4302 2018-04-30 15:56:53 It was fun because we had baby oil as well 
4303 2018-04-30 15:56:43 Is Nigeria exempt from being a shit-hole because of the oil?
4304 2018-04-30 15:56:35 Right? Goes to show that the combination of the pressure of 60,000 people, running, being slightly clumsy and baby oil don’t mix.
4305 2018-04-30 15:56:27 Trying out spot treatment with tea tree oil. Let’s see if it’ll work for my skin since it’s been dead as a dessert cause of Malaysia’s constantly changing weather patterns

4310 2018-04-30 15:55:58 TRAIN Law is structured such 
1) larger take home pay because of lower income tax
2) higher cost of consumer goods to generate revenue off of oil, sugary drinks which are bad for health anyway.
3) Net effect 1 & 2 is more money ppl's pockets
4311 2018-04-30 15:55:55 bestnyaaaaaa pakai oil cleasing ni. smooth je. i really hope its works 
4312 2018-04-30 15:55:49 I really wish we can practice true federalism. When all oil producing state keep all earnings and the rest keep what ever they produce. And send a token to central government. Won’t the idiot @GovAyoFayose and his state come with a revenue plan?!

Hey poor people of America? You hearing this?
You should be crying for the billionaire oil tycoon who's feeling a bit pressured when having to comply with energy guidelines.
His only hardship is parting with his ass-load of cash.

4322 2018-04-30 15:54:26 Trading day is over as OIL consolidates above 200MA now 1H chart. WHALES will keep it here not let it move lower. 
NATGAS sets up to move lower, but momentum is weak. All limit orders cancelled.
4323 2018-04-30 15:54:25 ...and China is the top buyer of Nigeria’s crude,.well I wish China outputs more energy cars faster, so that their oil dependence would drop to the lowest. Maybe that’s when Nigerian politicians might consider looking else where. Crude oil has made our political class crude.

4330 2018-04-30 15:53:58 Absolutely not. I see, hear and research daily. Trump wants to be a dictator he wants to silence our press his entire administration is abusing our tax dollars the EPA guy knows nothing about science or global warming they just want to turn everything into oil fields now.
4331 2018-04-30 15:53:45 Welp, just spilled like 500 gallons of gasoline on myself at the gas station, so if ur in the library && smell the bp oil spill dw it’s just me
4332 2018-04-30 15:53:35 Every day, European colonists steal our lands, our oil, and all of our natural resources. They steal our labor, our minds, our future. At some point, it becomes treasonous to remain fixated on talking abour your crotch-pleasures above our stolen heritage.
4333 2018-04-30 15:53:30 But all the investment side if you've got investments in stocks that have anything to do with oil Natural Gas you are happy that he's screwing this country up for the benefit of a dollar.
4334 2018-04-30 15:53:27 How about now? When you took office gas was dropping, since you took office it's nearly doubled and energy bills keep climbing as well, thanks for gutting our environment to double oil company profits. The proof is in the pudding
4335 2018-04-30 15:53:24 I take my power washer to everything. Then I season the grates with canola oil after drying.
4336 2018-04-30 15:53:17 I’m sitting here waiting on this Oil change and this toothless mechanic got a whole Attitude! He is about to get Cussed out
4337 2018-04-30 15:53:15 What!?
The fact that we only have one buyer of Canadian oil doesn't strike you as a problem? If we could sell to the rest of the world NAFTA wouldn't enter the conversation. This isn't a "government" problem its an "environmental opposition" problem.

4353 2018-04-30 15:51:48 Umm. Let me get that straight. The purpose of the pipeline is to get higher international prices for AB oil. Yet BC already gets much of its fuel internationally. This does not compute. Are the prices going to be higher or lower? AB is planning to subsidise BC consumers?

4378 2018-04-30 15:49:36 Alberta has this belief that if they are allowed to sell oil to Asia, the price they’re getting from Pacific North West refineries will increase to the level they’d get from Asia. If most of our RELIABLE supply comes from PNW refineries then, BC gas prices will increase with #TMX
4379 2018-04-30 15:49:34 A high oil price has got many friends, including the US.

4385 2018-04-30 15:48:52 Mayonnaise & coconut oil treatments are great, but a good damage repair/moisturizing shampoo would make a big difference too because you would be using it regularly. Doing hair treatment masks once every week or two is also good. Consistency is key!

4392 2018-04-30 15:48:29 This is so wrong. I think it’s all about money from the oil and gas industries. They don’t want to encourage renewable energy because it cuts into their profits. The politics of it are profound.

4395 2018-04-30 15:48:06 My Xantia 1.8 16v liked a bit of oil, so it's good to note that one reportedly doesn't. The stance doesn't look saggy in the rear, and it's even air conditioned. I'd say it's a decent load lugger.

4432 2018-04-30 15:43:47 Spray that nasty rusty wall with oil, we surely don't want illegals to get rust burns from climbing it, after all they hate America and our @POTUS who says we can't be kind and keep the trash out of our America, are they Mules, terrorist, disease's, ??

4439 2018-04-30 15:43:30 Does he look like he just ate a spoonful of oil?
4440 2018-04-30 15:43:29 This answer makes sense. Not answered is why US has a base(s?) at oil refinery in Syria obviously to protect it, when we have enough oil & gas domestic resources to sell overseas. Big Oil makes billion$ in profits each yr to afford own security. Instead stressed US taxpayers pay
4441 2018-04-30 15:43:26 Trump is destroying the press because they are the defense against oil companies, Putin, dishonest banks, and Amero-nazis. Stephen Miller is pleased.

4445 2018-04-30 15:43:06 1.61$?! Here in MTL we freak out when it goes over 1.40$. Oil companies are miserable!
4446 2018-04-30 15:43:06 Now we've destroyed the land with oil spills & fracking.
Poisoned the land & water with pesticides.
If that isn't bad enough we spring forward & fall back for a few months then wonder why do we feel so bad? Don't worry there's a pill for it. Should we put the Indians in DC?

4448 2018-04-30 15:42:51 I brushed a cookie sheet with olive oil and laid the salmon skin side down. In a bowl I mixed melted butter, salt, cracked pepper, old bay, dill and lemon juice. I brushed it over the fish, sprinkled fresh rosemary and thyme on it and baked it 10 min at 425.
4449 2018-04-30 15:42:37 Yes, the thicker the oil the graver the spill consequences

4466 2018-04-30 15:41:34 We investigate all reports of policy non-compliance. We have written to our suppliers about the Greenpeace report asking for additional information and reminding them that we will not take palm oil produced on peatlands.

4503 2018-04-30 15:38:32 In my view it depends strongly on the oil price. Should oil surge, shares will go up but still underperform. If oil falls, we will be seeing an huge collapse of oil companies.

4516 2018-04-30 15:36:56 Sort of. Regardless of availability of oil, there’s very limited refinery capacity in Canada and Washington state. We can buy raw flour for cheap, but we have precious few bread machines to make it into usable product.

4565 2018-04-30 15:33:19 Actually, it's the Conservatives who want to manipulate the market. They want to tell oil companies (refiners) and pipeline companies where and how to operate. Irving, for example, said that it would continue to buy Saudi oil even if EE proceeded. That's the free market.

You have to better choices

4572 2018-04-30 15:32:39 So yesterday after oil therapy, allergy medications, neti pots, face steamers, hot showers and 113 sneezes later, this morning this far I feel infinitely better. My lungs, ribs and throat are really sore and my lymph nodes a bit swollen and tender. Let's hope I keep feeling good!
4573 2018-04-30 15:32:30 I got this bomb ass body butter & some cocoa butter & coconut oil tht I use on my body every time I get out the shower & it makes my skin smooth & soft asf allllll day
4574 2018-04-30 15:32:25 El gremio se protege. Así debe ser.
4575 2018-04-30 15:32:21 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
4576 2018-04-30 15:32:13 First off that’s obviously a bad photoshop, u need glasses not to see that! Second anyone with a working brain knows oil is not sustainable in the long run so why demonize attempts at renewables? This only puts the US at a disadvantage in time as other countries forge ahead.

4578 2018-04-30 15:31:59 True, but we don’t have to give huge tax breaks to oil, megafarms, big pharma and already obscenely rich people on the backs of taxpayers either. Fox didn’t cover the trillion $ gift to the 1% did they.
4579 2018-04-30 15:31:53 Yes agreed.  Also think Zadina is going to slide down in this draft as well. He will get the pure shooter/QMJHL tag and I'm betting he moves down to 5/6. Not sure if that helps the Oil, but it might.
4580 2018-04-30 15:31:48 Kasalanan ng epicascent oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
4581 2018-04-30 15:31:43 We dont want a Canadian price for oil. We just want the ability to SUPPLY it, but the lefties think they need to manipulate the market. Let us supply it and prices will come down. Not rocket science. And dont start me on carbon taxes!!!!!
4582 2018-04-30 15:31:39 HAHA I meant deep-frying as in frying anything submerged in oil uwu like in a boiling pan or anything 

I mainly do omelettes, I think I've just been doing them for so long that I no longer screw them up every time www

(come here i will cook for u)
4583 2018-04-30 15:31:31 In northern Europe 80% of the olive oils sold are too old to be fit for human consumption... I personally eat a lot of olive oil - but I also grow my own and I never use it for cooking, only raw.
4584 2018-04-30 15:31:24 Why do Yoruba people add red oil in everything they eat except garri 

Garri even need the oil more
4585 2018-04-30 15:31:09 Every time I come across an economic report on #India #BoP & over there analyst attempts to predict CA AC based on forecasted oil prices I am reminded of a weatherman forecasting upcoming monsoon rains on the basis of forecasted reservoir levels. #oilprice
4586 2018-04-30 15:31:09 I agree with him!
They should just cut us adrift ASAP and we'll just have to get by on our own with nothing to keep us going but the oil; the gas; the Whisky; the sea foods; the beef; the lamb; all that Green Energy we get for free. Poor us
4587 2018-04-30 15:31:08 I trade both but usually XLE short-term. I'm also long oil stocks as a long-term investment

4596 2018-04-30 15:30:19 It became very clear to me sitting at the desk today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life regarding crude, has been wrong. My account is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every day of life regarding crude oil has been wrong.

4606 2018-04-30 15:29:27 I heard good things about it. How do you take it? Pill form or do you put the actual black seed oil in your food? Fill me in!
4607 2018-04-30 15:29:24 BC: don’t ship oil through our province.
Also BC: gas prices are too high so unfair.

4609 2018-04-30 15:29:09 We already have anti-trust laws to protect consumers from market that are controlled by a few providers, this is still happening in the oil & telecom industries. Cable is worst. Anti-trust laws appear out of vogue or improperly applied, maybe they’re too hard to enforce?

4611 2018-04-30 15:29:00 Allspice essential oil is a natural compound with a host of different health benefits. At various times, for various users, it's been used as an anesthetic, an antioxidant, an analgesic, a relaxant, an antiseptic, a carminative, a rubefacient, a tonic, and a stimulant.
4612 2018-04-30 15:28:53 @go_scriptor  On the side came a big dish of potatoes sautéed in olive oil with rosemary, nice enough but underseasoned to our crude tastes, there being no salt or pepper provided on the table for any such impudent correction of the kitchen.

4621 2018-04-30 15:27:38 Wait...so your source for this information is the very government that benefits from the tax dollars??

Isn't that like asking the snake oil salesman if his oil will REALLY fix all your ailments??

That is some real "interesting" journalism...
4622 2018-04-30 15:27:31 Clay Williams, CEO of National Oilwell Varco, spends much of his speech at OTC defending oil and gas. Says the industry should be proud of all it has done for mankind and standards of living. He briefly mentions issues related to carbon, climate.
4623 2018-04-30 15:27:10 I totally understand there is no correlation. I would love to see our own refineries and not more traffic in local waters. I wish I could understand why we don’t refine and process our own oil? It just doesn’t make any sense if it is a nessesary evil we must have.

4628 2018-04-30 15:26:40 If you change your oil and oil filter, don't throw the old oil and used filter in the garbage or dump the oil down the sewer drain. Take everything to your nearest designated recycling center. Many oil change places and auto parts stores accept used oil and filters.
4629 2018-04-30 15:26:39 Can you clarify that? Is it similar to No.2, No.4, or No.6 fuel oil? I assume not 2, as that's very close to diesel.
4630 2018-04-30 15:26:34 Almost time to get a oil change

4637 2018-04-30 15:25:48 The world needs 3.1 million barrels per day of new oil production every year just to meet existing demand. (IEA)

That doesn’t factor in booming global oil demand growth.

4639 2018-04-30 15:25:44 What's the point of drilling off NJ when you could drill off any other state with bigger reserves and save yourself the shipping costs? We don't want the support money. We want to not have our biggest tourist attraction get ruined by inevitable oil spills.

4695 2018-04-30 15:20:55 Even if that were true (it's not), the new pipeline wouldn't solve that, even if was finished 4 years from now.

Gas prices now are a result of oil companies gouging BC residents.

OIL 1H extends above 200MA & is pulling back now. My limit order is in sync with a CONFIRMING MOVE back below 200MA. WATCH DWT?
4708 2018-04-30 15:19:15 Small oil spills have not been well handled in BC.  It's disappointing that the talk of ocean and coastal protection hasn't been backed up with action.
4709 2018-04-30 15:19:13 But that’s my point, right? Social security, welfare, prison system, marijuana, health care, veteran care, our TAXES, oil, infrastructure and more that the government has their hands in, how good do they reaaaallly do?

4713 2018-04-30 15:18:54 I agree with the need to reduce emissions you are delusional if you think this will actually happen. The large National Oil Companies of Russia, Middle East, Nigeria, Mexico etc. depend heavily on those royalty and tax income streams. Their economies depend on it.

4714 2018-04-30 15:18:45 Exactly. It's known as "tripping pipe." They'll feed those pipes down the shaft until they hit oil.
4715 2018-04-30 15:18:38 #skincare #dermatology - #HYALURONIC acid injections will soon become much less common!  At least 1 company is developing the SKINCARE HOLY GRAIL to replace them:- An diluted oil or creme that can be rubbed on yet is able to be as effective as injections after a few uses.
4716 2018-04-30 15:18:36 .@bonappetit why on earth are you publishing listicles about crystal healing? Isn’t this a cooking magazine? Will you review different brands of snake oil in next month’s issue?

4740 2018-04-30 15:16:18 Not to mention BC’s oil and gas industry suffered the same downturns, both recent and in the big one in the 80s, which hit places like Fort St John and Dawson Creek hard. Some people need to learn about economics and history before they open their orifaces to insert things 
4741 2018-04-30 15:16:17 Because you are the only one promoting balloons as nice natural products from rubber trees that help the environment - although actually just like palm oil natural forest habitats have been destroyed for rubber production.
4742 2018-04-30 15:16:10 Thank you.... only if the doctor prescribes it for me. I have CBD oil but that doesn't do much.

4763 2018-04-30 15:14:22 Are you helping them work toward their oil clean up badge, and that's why you're okay with the penneast pipeline? Republicans like you don't care about our natural resources.

4768 2018-04-30 15:14:05 One thing is profit and the other is surveillance and making sure nothing bad is going on from their perspective. It is hard to explain to our major oil and gas clients why it does not work or why this region is having these bans...

4783 2018-04-30 15:12:25 The BC NDP and Greens didn't just start fighting the oil industry when they took power. They've been doing it for a decade. We have the LARGEST proven oil reserves in the World and we can't get oil to either coast. We import refined oil.  I see the link.

4816 2018-04-30 15:09:11 You should try to make mayo from scratch to demystify it.

Eggs and oil with an acid to act as emulsifier. It's kinda cool.

Adding a bit of water at the end makes it more creamy and less of that greasy gelatinous texture too.

4836 2018-04-30 15:06:16 "Most domestic trophies before you", "won in Europe before you"... very selective...didnt win the league 1st, never won the European Cup, will need a golden generation of continued oil funded success before you even get close to Liverpool...
4837 2018-04-30 15:06:08 Chi, Got a question. Most oil cos way upside down on OTC Hedges. If they buy Crude futures, to offset, for the purpose of COT is that a hedge or a spec posn?
4838 2018-04-30 15:06:00 And oil is half of what it was last spike. So what could possibly be driving it up? Federal government needs public support for a pipeline. #Coincidence

You can't "own" water...but you can own the rights to it! Therefore, the new oil is "information rights," and people are starting to figure that out.

4932 2018-04-30 14:59:17 Petrol is increasing because subsides have been systematically removed. The govt. spent 1.6 lakh crores of tax payer money on oil subsidy in 2012-13. Now this is directly on petrol as taxes. Remember, in the end it's money form your pocket.

4975 2018-04-30 14:53:09 ““The rise in prices is the result of temporary refinery closures and the shutdown of the Olympic pipeline in Washington State, as well as a general increase in the price of crude oil.”
Chuck I trust you read the article.
4976 2018-04-30 14:53:07 I like the relish-y effect with pork tenderloin or grilled chicken. The plain fog butter would also be good sandwiches i, say, an olive oil cake, or as a jam filling in, maybe, gingery muffins?

4980 2018-04-30 14:52:38 What is hyperinflation and why does it matter? 

Notice food prices going up? 

Notice oil and gasoline prices going up? 

How are these controlled?  
Is this predictable? 

Every market is rigged through computer algorithms. Bad guys (banksters) are still in charge.

As for that England being screwed part how much of UK GDP is from oil these days????

4991 2018-04-30 14:51:53 Alberta has more crude oil supply than it has pipeline capacity and this problem will only get worse in the near term. Both AB and CDN govts have a huge stake in more revenue from crude oil sales. Also, BC isn't being asked, it's being told.

5005 2018-04-30 14:50:52 I've done the currency & liters to gallons conversion and gas is over $4 USD a gallon in #Aruba. You can see the oil rigs from shore AND you can see Venezuela on a clear day. Make of that what you will. Luckily, it's a small island (the size of DC) & we only used $10 of gas.
5006 2018-04-30 14:50:52 Ted no one is speaking to the fact that America is responsible for this apocalypse.  Where George was only interested in Iraqi oil and took his eye off the ball. Obama cleaned up that mess too late now trump is making it worse. How much worse? We'll soon learn the hard way.

5013 2018-04-30 14:50:25 Pierre Andurand, one of oil’s most prominent hedge fund managers, said the current reluctance of energy companies to invest in new production meant $300 a barrel was “not impossible” within a few years.

5021 2018-04-30 14:49:46 Anything oil is fair game.  As much as I hate to prohibit anything it really is all about the oil.
Dabs, carts, tinctures.  (Maybe some 'shroom tea to wash it down).
5022 2018-04-30 14:49:42 He is aware of everything. The truth is that oil and gas gain in BIAFRALAND that USA gets is more important to America than the human rights of BIAFRANS. As soon as BIAFRANS take control of their resources Trump will seek them.. USA & UK support EVIL as long as it gives money.
5023 2018-04-30 14:49:38 The 1% thing is good to know, but it doesn't really change that oil traffic increases 7 fold.

5045 2018-04-30 14:48:03 Good article by Baker, but it overemphasizes the Bush-Cheney Admin's efforts and Iraq 2003 as an explanation -- and underplays the crucial British role in painstaking diplomacy, not to mention Europe's need for oil and cooperation on migration control.

5095 2018-04-30 14:42:52 I think it works for SOME people bc it's natural, but it depends on what you use as a solvent or uh ... Whatever makes your mix stick together? Obvs oil will not be good on your face

5097 2018-04-30 14:42:35 Cool! You can use that as the base of a nice salad dressing w/lemon juice and olive oil—good with bitter greens. Try as a filling pinwheeled in puff pastry or cookie dough. If you can do goat cheese, it makes nice crostini. Make into relish w/shallots, balsamic, lemon zest.

5108 2018-04-30 14:41:40 300 barrel of oil? I’m pretty sure it would have cascading effects on economy, from inflation and costs of living. We don’t even need to get to it, 2 quarters of that and we’re pretty much toast.
5109 2018-04-30 14:41:33 There is an oil/lube joke in here somewhere.

5113 2018-04-30 14:40:50 This article from 2015 says Neem Oil had been used just twice in the past 5 years by 2 Soil Association growers under special permission. Permission was given incorrectly by applying the international organic standards, without checking for domestic legislation updates. (1/3)

5115 2018-04-30 14:40:43 More Birn: Canadian crude looks a lot like Venezuela. Venezuelan crude is in vessels and it goes into Asia. It goes to the United States. So it's not like heavy crude oil is foreign to the global oil market. Crude oil in a tanker in the global oil market will find a home.

5119 2018-04-30 14:40:27 Well, those protestors want an “oil free coast” & “no pipleline” & “no tankers”.....so this should be a non-issue. 
5120 2018-04-30 14:40:27 There's no plan even for the elementary school that's a few hundred meters away from the oil tanks.  God forbid, if something happens there, those kids, teachers and staff are simply on their own in a "sacrifice zone".  School authorities know this.
5121 2018-04-30 14:40:25 300 barrel of oil? I’m pretty sure that would cause quite a few cascading effects if it held for a quarter. We don’t even need to get to it.

5127 2018-04-30 14:40:10 You are something but its not wooed. two questions for you
1) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
2) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get from Westminster?
Think carefully Jock,,no unionist has answered those
5128 2018-04-30 14:40:06 Much like her oil exploration ban, wades in without much thought. Interesting to see commerce com come out pretty quickly and say there is nothing illegal in BP’s practice and you’d think the PM would be aware of their position...except easy points hitting on oil cmps!

5130 2018-04-30 14:39:56 Coconut oil is wonderful for the hair, but it’s not instant results, you gotta do it like twice a week or so. Stay away from heat & hair products. Get some shampoo that has coconut oil in it. My fav is shampoo with honey!

5140 2018-04-30 14:38:35 Does that oil help curve your appetite?
5141 2018-04-30 14:38:12 Cancelled Northern Gateway because a Harper project. Trans Canada East was to save Que Lib seats. Now must have KM to help restore Alberta economy, so 60% of $20 B transfers can continue to go to Quebec. Thus we get $600K unethical oil imports daily.

5155 2018-04-30 14:35:53 @drvox  So I found your piece on hydrocarbons particularly silly.  As less is used for fuel, more and more are used and needed as the essential raw material for making virtually everything.  So still need oil and gas wells, pipelines and refineries or civilization stops dead.
5156 2018-04-30 14:35:52 Just about everything on your list has been going on since atleast gw bush. Smh.

Ichan’s Oklahoma oil refinery gets exemption from emission regulations due to “financial hardship”. This saves Ichan tens of millions of dollars! Tax scam  must not have been enough!
5165 2018-04-30 14:34:36 As a lay person from the perspective of oil and tarsands, I can't quibble about individual studies done. As an engineer in another resource field, I know how studies or the overall assessment can be manipulated to come put with the conclusions they want.
5166 2018-04-30 14:34:35 And reduction of quantity demanded and slowdown of the economy overall. Both, I’m told, positive for higher oil prices, or something.

5183 2018-04-30 14:32:45 After indy scots would have 100% of oil and gas revenues instead of the 8% we get at present.
Do you think England would ever accept a "deal" as bad as that for its oil and gas if it had any?
5184 2018-04-30 14:32:44 it's means that the oil business is good that side

5187 2018-04-30 14:32:26 I chased down that myth months ago. According to Prof @GK_Fellows KM never included it in NEB submissions, doesn't say it publicly. It's been politicians like @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau who have repeated it, when they shouldn't have. Oil is fungible. No magic price premium.

5189 2018-04-30 14:32:14 I think it’s the fact that the oil is so hot Its slowly but surely pulling the bad chemicals out and basically cooking with the food
5190 2018-04-30 14:32:04 omg re-discovered a girl i went to high school with is not only a hardcore anti-vaxxer but is against all medication and is an essential oil salesperson.  and she made her facebook entirely public.  i am truly blessed this morning.

5219 2018-04-30 14:29:42 I prolly eat more than most fat ppl (on average, I need ~3,500 calories to maintain weight). Fat ppl often struggle when forced to eat >120 g protein and >150 g healthy fats (i.e. no vegetable oil).

It's not uncommon for fat ppl to not eat much. They partition resources poorly.
5220 2018-04-30 14:29:32 While I can't sleep, anyone have any good alternatives to nuttelex (palm oil free) that the coconut based one and also are just like butter (same consistency/fat percentage) so I can use for baking and such? I don't wanna use palm oil products
5221 2018-04-30 14:29:26 And often would rub cooking oil on our skin to darken the damage, err I mean tan, and lemon juice in our fair to lighten it.
5222 2018-04-30 14:29:23 Pierre Trudeau tried in the 1980's and it was squashed by Alberta. Most of the oilsands + much of the oil has been sold to foreigners. Politicians: Progressive Conservatives in Alberta and federal Conservatives did most the selling. How is that for being conservative? Sad :(
5223 2018-04-30 14:29:23 People seem to forget that while the environmental impact is awful, oil companies are not in the business of losing $2 million dollars to accidents (current trade value of 6,100 m3 of bitumen). And they will do everything to prevent this.

5258 2018-04-30 14:25:56 The oil and gas industry is apparently worried that sparks from mobile device batteries could ignite fumes and blow up petrol stations. this is not based on any scientific record or experience that's why they don't strictly enforce it.
5259 2018-04-30 14:25:53 with that being said, if anyone has any recommendations for help help books—on communication, on keeping organized, etc— pls recommend. i’ve finished my oil change and now it’s time to nini
5260 2018-04-30 14:25:41 An oil and gas company contacted me and offer me a post. 

How do i react?

I just.. hate KL 
5261 2018-04-30 14:25:38 Who said there is a magical tidewater price? That hoary nonsense has been debunked long ago. Right now, US heavy imports from Mexico, Venezuela are declining, which means USGC is attractive, but so is optionality. Even AB oil CEOs don't trust Trump ;0)

5263 2018-04-30 14:25:33 Question. You take such care of animals with healthy foods, but I haven’t seen a healthy cooking episode on your show? Cooking with coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, low carb, low or no sugar (it is everything), organic meat, fruits and vegetables? Have I missed it?
5264 2018-04-30 14:25:05 There were high expectations heralded by the anti-corruption stance of the government & numerous promises made during the electoral campaigns which includes the commitment to addressing corruption in the oil & gas sector through drastic reforms @nigeriaeiti @OhMinemine @blecc27
5265 2018-04-30 14:25:03 This article from 2015 says Neem Oil had been used just twice in the past 5 years by 2 Soil Association growers under special permission. Permission was given incorrectly by applying the international organic standards, without checking for domestic legislation updates. (1/2)
5266 2018-04-30 14:25:03 april 30th? time to call my boyfriend who is in a big government mission at an oil rig and be vague about whether im pregnant or not
5267 2018-04-30 14:25:02 Wonder how these"refined products"reach other, distant places in the world distributed from countries to country, their airports etc.-The era of OIL is coming to its end, we'll need some by-products maybe forever but in time, a lot less-Why not be among the firsts to transition?
5268 2018-04-30 14:24:59 If oil was $140 a barrel in 2008 and we didn't pay $1.61 L then, why are we paying it now with oil at $67 a barrel... Collusion by the oil comp and greedy Govs that can't keep their hands out of the tax money and no spine, that's why!! How do you trust the Govs to deal with it???
5269 2018-04-30 14:24:52 As much as i don’t want to get this oil change and tune up . But I’ll rather have less money and a car than have a lot of money and no car. #priorities

5274 2018-04-30 14:24:33 It's that day! Pump day today @MorrisonABQ, bring your vacuum pump in for a free inspection, performance test and oil change and while you're waiting, enjoy some nachos on us. 10:00AM to 2:00PM.
5275 2018-04-30 14:24:09 i’m screaming at 12 in 1 body wash. y’all niggas really do take showers and wash ur hair with some shit that’s a body wash, shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, baby oil, relaxer, antiseptic, bleach, dye, spritz and cologne all in one.
5276 2018-04-30 14:24:06 Big Tobacco, Big Sugar, Big Pharma, Big Finance, Big Oil, Big Food, Big Farming, Big War... all have in common a heavy influence on the results of research they are funding. #4Corners
5277 2018-04-30 14:24:05 Problem is the refinery most likely won't. Or one of the oil companies would have done it. I know at least one of the upgraders can be converted for a low cost, and even at that price they can't make it work. Let's save our billions instead for the day we can make some money.

5280 2018-04-30 14:23:45 Physically? Or whose oil is in there? My #BigLong take is Brent was (not the first time) ramped by US financial buying from 1st July 2017 & curve supported by Saudi capital. Loss on backwardation is insignificant compared to extra $10m/day per $/barrel on the flat price #OOTT

5282 2018-04-30 14:23:25 Don't bother to do your research or anything. The bill also makes it illegal to bring oil drilled offshore into NJ ports. No point in drilling offshore in NJ if you have to ship it off to another state. Our reserves are too small, may as well drill elsewhere.
5283 2018-04-30 14:23:21 CLIMATE SOLUTIONS are MEANINGLESS: CLIMATE CHANGE IS NATURAL + SUN-DRIVEN, DESPITE FALSE, TAX-RAISING, OIL PRICE BOOSTING #ClimateCO2N !!!

5285 2018-04-30 14:22:59 How unhealthy mineral oil is for skin and hair, we all know. Had I been buying it from shop, I would’ve seen the ingredients and not bought it. But Nykaa fooled me. Total credibility is lost now.

5290 2018-04-30 14:22:19 Well just a thought or two about shells
Will there be more with in general climate change more specific number or hurricanes fluctuations in tides and pools water temps?
Do shells keep oil on them when hit by an oil slick

5294 2018-04-30 14:21:46 Return from the trip and the truck has a terrible oil leak. So dropping it off now. Cars are one of my least favorite items. Such a waste of money.
5295 2018-04-30 14:21:43 Gabriel closed his eyes. His wings hadn't felt such gentle care in so long, it almost felt foreign to him.

After some time, his oil glands finally started working again. Gabriel shook out his wings to help the oil spread around better.

5346 2018-04-30 14:17:51 I get the argument from industry types all the time: "I've worked all over the world in oil and gas, and no one can match Canada's regulatory system." But aside from that anecdotal evidence, which politicians love to repeat, it would be nice to have studies.
5347 2018-04-30 14:17:48 Pipelines - shiny, clean, economical, safe and reliable.

As Technology eventually becomes more affordable the rational market will move.

5376 2018-04-30 14:14:45 Is olive oil overhyped? Some of the vegan cooks recommend cooking veggies in only water for more heart healthiness (fats from avocados, tahini, nuts, etc.).
5377 2018-04-30 14:14:42 A misunderstanding can act as a spark to the oil spread, its better to avoid it or everything burns including yourself
5378 2018-04-30 14:14:41 2/2 If the industry grows as planned it will only hit the 100 MT mark in 2030 if no advancements are made in in-situ technology and SORs are required to grow by 10%. If recent advancements are used in new projects the oil sands still never hits 100 MT, rather about 90 MT in 2030
5379 2018-04-30 14:14:09 This article from 2015 says Neem Oil had been used just twice in the past 5 years by 2 Soil Association growers under special permission. Permission was given incorrectly by applying the international organic standards, without checking for domestic legislation updates. (1/3)

5423 2018-04-30 14:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

5426 2018-04-30 14:09:14 The just concluded CNN's analysis on #Buhari and #Trump's meeting is that oil would likely be top of the agenda considering that recently Trump called on the need to reduce oil price and Nigeria being a giant oil producer.

5429 2018-04-30 14:08:49 It goes past our coast anyways, whether on our ship to Asia or on a ship that left from a port in Washington. The oil is already going. And I trust our tugs (required to get in through the complicated waterways) and our standards more than most other places in the world.

5462 2018-04-30 14:04:12 Dropping dollar from oil trade by Iran, China, Syria and Russia with further perspective of EU being placed under the rule of  trading with Russia builds obvious anger in USA. Israel is acting as the pretext to involve USA response-protecting the petrodollar.

5474 2018-04-30 14:02:42 I’m always amazed at people like yourself who have no clue about the oil and gas industry, other than “educating” yourself by what you read. I have worked in oil and gas since 1985 and could possibly know a bit more about it, we are not out here poisoning the world.
5475 2018-04-30 14:02:37 Largely you can't. Under 50% of Canada's heavy oil production is recovered from mining, the remainder is recovered from a well head. For both processing is required before you have a product that can be used as asphalt or shipped as a solid.

5522 2018-04-30 13:58:28 You’re right! We realize that we may have only scratched the surface and are hoping that before the mid-July filings come out, we identify some more oil & gas companies and people tied to the industry.

5526 2018-04-30 13:58:05 Gabriel shifted and slowly opened his wings, wincing as they moved. Their golden glow had become dull and bloodstained. His soft feathers had become stiff from lack of oil, and his oil glands were inflamed.

Europeans (Italians) love to use it with olive oil as a salad dressing... vinaigrette.  It's yummy, and kills bugs in lettuce leaves, cucumber, tomatoes etc.

I wonder what the average usable lifespan is for a bike compared to a car.

5611 2018-04-30 13:47:37 I believe he has organized crime connections which has control of shipping in Quebec so no significant money in his pocket from an oil pipeline. Just my thoughts though I’m sure???

5623 2018-04-30 13:46:23 Less oil being produced but we are still using at a the same rate inevitably Drives prices higher.  I still believe that gas prices will continue to climb higher with a stronger economy.  If we can handle it, they’ll most certainly test it.

Never mind, #US/#AIPAC & your friendly rebel terrorists will close the gap unless #Putin elects to unleash air defences & electronic warfare systems.
5646 2018-04-30 13:43:26 Yeah beauty supplies and any health stores. Any one that’s 100% Black castor oil imma send you a picture of what my aunt uses (she has cancer) her hair is still thick as hell even thicker really

5652 2018-04-30 13:42:08 30 years ago, before they discovered oil... they were ignorant and low... 30 years later, they discover oil...they are still ignorant and low
5653 2018-04-30 13:42:04 What makes me mad about marijuana still enforced federally as a schedule 1 drug is the way the United States has lied to us since 1932 about it.  Oil companies wanting to get rid of hemp in 1932?  Big money from alcohol wanting it crushed in 1932?  Big money is what started it?

5655 2018-04-30 13:41:48 Knowledge, skills and innovation potiental are a country’s key resources for competitive advantage. It’s no longer about the oil. #Knowledge_based_economy
5656 2018-04-30 13:41:41 Oil inventories down since 2017. Mostly due to opec/Russia agreeing to produce less oil in 2016 and extending it thru 2018. USA is producing its most ever and is actually exporting oil. However, when OPEC (Saudi Arabia)and Russia decide to do produce less, it makes an impact.
5657 2018-04-30 13:41:37 "Our" oil!

5661 2018-04-30 13:41:15 because me doing anything alone won't change anything. there's too many brainwashed fools like you by the oil industry who will never change their greedy, wasteful lifestyles
5662 2018-04-30 13:41:11 I normally cut off an inch off the bottom and lightly sautee them in olive oil and fresh herbs or throw them into the oven.
5663 2018-04-30 13:41:07 Thinking of implementing a spinning wheel for #StJudePLAYLIVE donations. Thoughts?
Spin the wheel for a minimum $X.XX donation (TBD). Sections will have good or bad (subjective) things for consumption (e.g., a shot glass of hot sauce, liquor, or olive oil). Ideas? Suggestions?

5671 2018-04-30 13:40:33 Where is it coming from, what is the source because that will answer so many questions? Nigeria is a rich country filled with minerals and oil.  See the picture?
5672 2018-04-30 13:40:31 c'mon - right after a Pompeo meeting and ahead of May 12. It's a given we'd expect something like this. But in this knee-jerk headline-driven market, oil is sure to respond and erase the 1 percent drop this morning.
5673 2018-04-30 13:40:30 Israeli PM Netanyahu will hold a press conference where he will apparently reveal proof that Iran has breached the nuclear agreement. Will be interesting to see the markets reaction, especially oil. Expected in just over 3 hours.

5683 2018-04-30 13:39:45 Israel has been hitting Iranian targets in Syria lately.  Everyone in oil markets are concerned over Trump pulling out of the Iran deal, and possible sanctions affecting supply (unwarranted in that US hasn't taken Iranian oil for years)

5689 2018-04-30 13:39:01 @Morning_Joe - The push to return to coal reminds me of the 18th century uprisings by "Whalers" protesting this new fangled lamp oil that was threatening their "Jobs". Back to Whale oil and horse drawn plows! Progress! By the way the Native Americans want their country back.

Any luck getting an answer to my question? As of this morning it is still showing Ford and not Oil.
5695 2018-04-30 13:38:29 You need to start treating your face with a olive oil very thinly you’ll see the difference then .
5696 2018-04-30 13:38:22 Perhaps it's a bit like the whole "comfort animal" phenom. People exploiting it in order to bring their pig on a plane.

5703 2018-04-30 13:37:43 Saudi looks inward by Launching Qidiyya Entertainment Resort within the Kingdom, a potential $30Bn opportunity. Saudi Aramco, with $2Tr value, plans away from oil, yet Nigerian Leaders, only fix appointments with oil executives. We need youthful productivity value, not oil.
5704 2018-04-30 13:37:42 I'm a big fan of putting sriracha or chili oil in mine...but any kind of cheese is classic and I respect it
5705 2018-04-30 13:37:35 "Death of hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs"????? Sorry going to need backup for this claim with empirical evidence. The entire Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction industry employs 199,780 down by about 30K jobs from it's high point.

5732 2018-04-30 13:34:40 Honesty? A little bit of soap and water. Then I oil the crap out of it before each use. If there's gunk in the bottom, I try to remember to deglaze while it's still hot, otherwise I scrape it with a wooden spoon. Probably not ideal, but being too precious about a pan seems silly.

5795 2018-04-30 13:28:25 .@CNBCnow OMG, this must be the year of snake oil salesmanship listening to @JohnLegere pumping the #TmobileSprintMerger, almost as good as @realDonaldTrump BS :)
5796 2018-04-30 13:28:09 Literally just wanted an oil change now I’m buying tires 
5797 2018-04-30 13:27:42 Prices go down? Less competition and prices go down? If you believe that I have some special snake oil that prevents aging.... $TMUS $S #consumerslose
5798 2018-04-30 13:27:40 Good article. However, if you spend less than 8-9€ per liter to buy Italian OO, here in Italy, you're almost certainly buying a subpar product. Quality oil is expensive.
5799 2018-04-30 13:27:38 What I think the world needs to stop fighting over territory’s and oil and bullshit and start working together to further expand with the universe instead of staying on one planet. Cause usage of all resources and overpopulation is a bound to happen. So let’s avoid that as humans
5800 2018-04-30 13:27:35 There is more recoverable oil today than was known even five years ago. If we pumped 365 24/7 there is over 200 years of oil. So no, we’re not running out.
5801 2018-04-30 13:27:28 Maybe some females gotta use less cuz some be looking like they smacked baby oil their face
5802 2018-04-30 13:26:48 Only saw it now but I withdraw that comment

Me: So how’s it going? You guys busy here?

Him: Oh ya. We broke our Jan/Feb/Mar record. People are cashing out their 401ks to buy cars, the economy is good. 

Me: 
5808 2018-04-30 13:26:21 Yeah! They also should offer Blue Magic and Luster’s Pink Oil Moisturizer! WTF!
5809 2018-04-30 13:26:12 "Organic" is going to be less and less believable the more trump deregulates everything so big ag & big oil & corporations can make more $$$ with less rules & oversight.

5811 2018-04-30 13:25:34 @kairyssdal This morning I read an article about an oil hedge fund manager commenting on the market's ability to sustain $300/bbl oil. That sounds like BS, historically. Given that he would profit substantially, would that be considered market manipulation?
5812 2018-04-30 13:25:31 Very cool. Where did you get the trees and are those paintings oil?
5813 2018-04-30 13:25:22 Do these people think the president just sets the prices of oil

I for one am tired of usungbour military as a mercenary kill squad to boost sails for our military establishments. The same goes for giving big oil help.
5821 2018-04-30 13:23:53 Very good analogy. And Perfectly True. Nothing surpasses Israeli water treatment technology. Israel is rich in those things that matter, not like those others who can only sell their oil.

We were losing 6-1 and their keeper - ex-Chonburi & Thailand NT - was messing about coming out of his area. When I next got the ball, I noticed he was off his line & lobbed him from the halfway line.

I don't ever advocate violence but US tactics worldwide are dangerous.#STOP

5872 2018-04-30 13:19:35 I get that. Who wants to buy snake oil (especially you)? I think long and hard about things, but I also believe there is more than our senses alone can determine. I get called deluded etc but I can live with that. I can only share what I have found - not selling anything! 
5873 2018-04-30 13:19:28 I could care less if vancouver pays $2.00 a litre. Trouble is its going up here too. Last time gas was this high oil was $110.00 a bbl in 2008.

5945 2018-04-30 13:11:18 Russia, Iran and Syria have all now dumped the dollar, with the sanctions on Russia US will suffer as it needs titanium/steel for the space/weapons program. China has also dumped the dollar-eventually this will have dire consequences for US in oil market.

5960 2018-04-30 13:09:58 The #BJP govt had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre. India has the highest retail prices of petrol and diesel among SA nations
5961 2018-04-30 13:09:46 You make it sound hard, but all that oil and coal costs on average about 1 ct/kWh to extract, transport, proces and deliver to end use.
Wind/solar costs five times as much, and that's before you get around to storing wind/solar for use during the night or periods of low winds...

6117 2018-04-30 12:51:19 That’s not the point at all, but it’s also not gonna be cool to spill cold oil everywhere.
The danger is if you need to move it off the heat source quickly, especially w/ electric burners that don’t cool down fast enough. Pan starts to burn you’re SOL.

6274 2018-04-30 12:32:28 When I first came into the markets it was about £20 bbl. always amuses me when commentators suggest that we're not in a high oil environment
6275 2018-04-30 12:32:12 Since the carbon tax makes up for pennies of that, and gas is twice as expensive now as it was when oil was twice the cost, you better talk to your corporate oil sponsors.
6276 2018-04-30 12:32:07 If you were involved? Trust me I’ve got enough intelligence (in every sense) to discover evidence.

So how’s your aspirations as oil magnate doing? Any contracts with current Bellville, or Cape Town, administration?

Or should I make rightful application for access to that info?

6347 2018-04-30 12:22:35 They have lower human rights than the liberal west mate, and find zero problem with anti black racism. They may not bomb countries for the sake of oil but they're recolonising Africa, slowly but surely, and who doesn't like the dalai lama, preaching peace?

6349 2018-04-30 12:22:24 I think one of these days soon, the Oil will have the appetite to buyout Lucic. But this upcoming season? No way. Buyout would be crippling for them. And I’m sure they could, if they wanted, trade him and retain salary.

6382 2018-04-30 12:20:03 Lots of excitement about oil prices becoming a drag on the global economy but our team think the price boosting impact of geopolitical tensions (#Iran, #Syria) and #OPEC production restraint will be offset by rising #US production and softening #China demand
6383 2018-04-30 12:19:50 But these investments will be profitable; US domestic gas prices are much lower than oil, in energy terms. "Let's make America great again" anyone?

6398 2018-04-30 12:18:06 I hate seeing the book talkers getting free book-talking ads in major media. At least help out the readers and investors by noting that oil at $300 barrel is unlikely, has never happened, but shock value passes for news. The correspondents dinner sounds like fun. #KFC

6402 2018-04-30 12:17:51 "The most important metric for OPEC and its friends, according to Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih, is the level of investment in future oil production capacity"

If I read it right that means "every time you start to drill, we'll pump enough to make you unprofitable".
6403 2018-04-30 12:17:49 (AP) The U.S. daily national average for regular gasoline is now $2.81 per gallon. That's up from about $2.39 per gallon a year ago, according to Oil Price Information Service. And across the U.S., 13 percent of gas stations are charging $3 per gallon or more, AAA said last week.

6413 2018-04-30 12:16:30 An agent responded quickly, quoting prices for the original oil paintings (several thousend British Pounds) and reproductions (in the range of about half a thousand ₤), with ways how to obtain the art, and with a message from the artist:

6439 2018-04-30 12:14:08 Australia, due to our location in the world and lack of oil it would have been hard for Australia to continue. also considering we have the largest supply of uranium in the world it would have made us a very good target since things in fallout is run by nuclear power.

6461 2018-04-30 12:11:17 The US could convert part of its oil consumption into gas, and start exporting the saved oil, hitting world oil prices. This would reduce the spending power of Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc.

6464 2018-04-30 12:10:56 How do they look forward when they make an off the cuff decision to ban oil and gas so Cinders can make her generational speech at #CHOGM18 and don’t consider the effects of this ? As soon as the pre arranged photo op at govt with GPeace it was so obvious #shallow #lookatme

6484 2018-04-30 12:08:34 BS! In Italy they would have first looked for a cause to his condition, which was undiagnosed. The British doctors condemned him to death without even knowing what was causing his condition, one can never say never, remember Lorenzo's oil?!
6485 2018-04-30 12:08:29 Just remembered the time a kid at school told us he used olbas oil as lube when having a wank. You could tell he wasn’t lying cos he offered up this information unprompted and he was deeply weird

6571 2018-04-30 11:56:54 I like how Brooke brought up her idea that “the world and environment would be better off without oil”. Instead of talking about how losing oil would harm us, she said a different view on the situation that not many had touched on yet & how it would benefit us #RidgeoSocSem4
6572 2018-04-30 11:56:37 As we now do Oil and renewable energy we are considering a re-brand, would like some feed back?
6573 2018-04-30 11:56:23 #RidgeSocSem4 I think that if we were without oil, our environment would definitely become cleaner. Ultimately, I think we could become better off without oil.

6610 2018-04-30 11:50:30 I agree with andrea that demand for gas would rise.

6618 2018-04-30 11:49:11 In the last days of oil mass conflict would probably ensue, not only between countriea but also with the general population. Oil is a necessity in the modern world and people would do anything to keep their lives going as normal  #RidgeSocSem4

6628 2018-04-30 11:47:42 I agree with Sophia that technology might be improved with a lack of oil, but it may also be unrealistic to rely on new technology to support an entire world that revolves around the use of a single resource to support the economy.  - Jillian #RidgeSocSem4

6630 2018-04-30 11:47:32 @LushLtd random question. Are bath oils safe to use in an oil burner?
6631 2018-04-30 11:47:29 At least the world will be forced to find a less harmful option to use for fuel. Oil has become a necessity, and we really don’t have much left to use in the first place. The world is more reactive than proactive, so if we lose all the oil, we’ll see more change. #RidgeoSocSem4

6638 2018-04-30 11:46:49 don't forget, when we had TONNES of reserves a few yrs back, OPEC began to cut oil production to drive those prices back up. Looks like it's finally working.

6770 2018-04-30 11:29:00 Here we go. Looking forward to a great discussion on @SquawkCNBC this morning about the growing #political tensions around the world & their impact on #oil prices. #OOTT #TradeWar
6771 2018-04-30 11:28:56 He thinks people hurt in Tesla factories are more valuable than other people, hurt by air pollution, gasoline fires, traffic accidents, environment catastrophe like oil spills. If someone wants move society away from using fossil fuel he thinks it doesn’t matter.

6782 2018-04-30 11:26:28 It’s unmistakable when there are large moves in one direction like we have seen recently. One shouldn’t expect mean reverting, 3-5% moves to have any impact.

6841 2018-04-30 11:16:03 There is no blame to be assigned. Gasoline is a global commodity, and prices rise and fall due to a number of factors: crude oil prices, refinery capacity, increasing demand and political unrest in oil-producing areas.

6851 2018-04-30 11:14:48 A better analogy is painting. Oil paint is terrible for the environment so should it be banned? It’s fine to use for art and small quantities on hard wearing surfaces. You wouldn’t paint a whole building with it.
6852 2018-04-30 11:14:38 Out of the 7 Emirates of the UAE Dubai is the least dependent on oil revenues. Dubai was built through a diversification strategy by building on its competitive advantages, e.g. location. UAE benefited from the Oil price shocks era and Eurodollar but Dubai is from smart planning.

6859 2018-04-30 11:13:20 OK That's all well and good that you've bought electric vehicles. Do they have any plastics? Rubber? Batteries? All these items are derived from crude oil. Even though the crude may not be turned into fuels it will still be required for your day to day life.

6893 2018-04-30 11:08:06 Agreed, last time oil was $150 a barrel was 2007-2008 and you all know what happen to the US economy then. $300 a barrel will certainly spark #ww3
6894 2018-04-30 11:08:04 The same is true of Corbyn. If infantile slogans are all you have, then reality becomes meaningless. When you propagate arguments like 'It's the neo cons' or 'it's all about the oil', then don't be surprised when some people start to believe you.

7041 2018-04-30 10:36:41 Mr. Trump never ceases to amaze one.  Yes to the following, misogyny, xenophobe, narcissist, personality disorder, ‘vulgar monger’ but he is sorting out, peace with Korea, trade with China and Europe, sanctions against Putin and the world oil price. So let’s welcome him in July.

7047 2018-04-30 10:35:40 U.S. shale is reactionary to prices - will be interesting to see if management teams are disciplined in deploying capital when we see $100 oil again.

7145 2018-04-30 10:18:47 True taxes have been raised on a provincial scale, but it's mainly because the tax on gas, aka the carbon tax. Oil prices and Canadian pipeline uncertainty is also a factor and it will likely rise as well.

7203 2018-04-30 10:08:16 Climate change is a global problem. Every country can come up with excuses for doing nothing along the lines that we are too small. And then your oil industry wins and our kids lose. That is exactly why you keep making the oil industry argument.
7204 2018-04-30 10:08:11 That's grotesque.  How much is spent worldwide per day to look for oil that, if burnt, will kill us? What could it be used for instead.

7209 2018-04-30 10:07:48 Indeed & based on @sajidjavid's performance so far he's someone who could not only weather the endless storms at the Home Office but actually begin to turn around that perpetually sinking oil tanker of a department. Thus, his appointment gets a thumbs up from me.

7269 2018-04-30 09:54:40 Price caps are due to margin of profit , In the case of stents profit was artificially many times high in thousands and lakhs, tax were same, In case of Pertrol profit is largely same , and price fluctuate on input cost of crude oil price.

7505 2018-04-30 09:09:00 If international crude oil prices continue to surge, the excise tax rollback would happen before the general election. I think first we need a government which is sure what it wants to do, then we should debate about less government. Rest remains election rhetoric!

7685 2018-04-30 08:26:54 CO2 does stick around in the atmosphere. You don't have to believe me, look it up. In the natural cycle, the amount put into the atmosphere is balanced by the amount taken in by the plants and the ocean.

But we changed that balance when we started burning coal and then oil.

7725 2018-04-30 08:18:03 But we should appreciate the technological advancement of US in  devolping its own oil/shale resources in just last 10 years & doubling US oil/gas production. While on other side S.Arabia has incresed its local consumption 4-fold in 20 years.

7839 2018-04-30 07:55:04 @drvox often underscores signif. impact of fracked gas & oil on near-term climate change. "RSS policies can divide them along temporal lines..ban on new extraction or by “sub-industry” lines, say, coal from natural gas." The sub-industry approach already exists & not working.

7859 2018-04-30 07:52:08 So watch for oil prices to spike higher again following these Israeli missile strikes on Syria. @POTUS was complaining about high oil prices last week but Israel's escalation in Syria and  restarting Iran sanctions will make it twice as bad.  Get ready for gas prices close to $3.
7860 2018-04-30 07:51:43 You're right Russel. If lake Taupo turned to oil it would make oil cheaper and increase demand. Fortunately nobody wants to breath diesel or even coal particulate any more. And we know the health costs of that are high.

7909 2018-04-30 07:41:16 Russians have dumped a lot of nuclear waste, including complete reactors in the arctic already, it is one of the hazards of drilling for oil there.

7922 2018-04-30 07:39:10 Agreed. These things take time, but it's very possible. This is not just possible it's happening. In Astana a traditionally oil reliant economy they're investing in a new AIFC finance centre. It's interesting as they're facilitating green finance. A very worthy investment.

7970 2018-04-30 07:27:49 I know this isn't really as much of an issue with the Accord specifically since they can come with the 2.0, but the issues that Honda's 1.5s are having right now with gas contaminating the oil would definitely turn me off from their lineup for now

Just goes to show if its just a punt with no real backing then one shouldnt ramp it to the moon. I saw things like "$5 oil in the ground= $350 value" on twitter

8119 2018-04-30 06:58:42 They keep talking about crude oil decrease is the reason why the government is unable to perform, can You imagine? What about the budgets they borrowed trillions of Naira? Where’s the money? Where are the projects? Your children will curse y’all for being dump mark my word.

But oil likely to remain cyclical even if EVs change trajectory 
And EVs could amplify cyclicality if adoption rates speed up and slow down with oil prices
8123 2018-04-30 06:57:44 It’s fair to say the media and last energy minister Judith collins have a lot to answer for at the height of GFC we paid $2.20 odd when oil was $100 us a barrel it went back down to 1. 80 $1.90 after GFC when oil went down to $30US  we still payed $1.90  $2.00 odd dodgy dealings

Without a positive tone, your words will knock.

8238 2018-04-30 06:30:33 Just like organizing a private placement 4 a Cdn venture mining/oil 'n gas co. A few will win; many more will lose. End of the day, rich people stealing from other rich people. But does it have an effect on ordinary working folks who need affordable housing? No. Decommodify.

I missed the oil change because it is not listed in the operators manual.

8250 2018-04-30 06:28:40 Lol I’m looking at your take that the cap situation “isn’t as bad as people think for the Oilers” . All this talk from the fans about adding a top 2 dman or top 6 winger. I think the grumpy Oiler writer put it the most honest terms I’ve seen. The Oil are adding zip of value.

8285 2018-04-30 06:21:25 Both, I think.  In the Italian context, it typically means lower grade olive oil falsely labeled as higher grade, or adulterated with other (cheaper) oils.  Ironically, olive oil from elsewhere is supposedly better in this regard.

8384 2018-04-30 06:02:34 This Nuxe dry oil smells like heaven. It calms me down. I need the body wash and perfume version.
8385 2018-04-30 06:02:33 Saudi Arabia = Oil= let's bury our heads in sand.
America = wants trade deals= loves UK and employs many people here who pay taxes= mass demonstrations and redicule. You couldn't make it up.
8386 2018-04-30 06:02:29 Its not oil anymore, its data~ lol!.

8388 2018-04-30 06:02:02 Cooking is more like math, where baking is more like chemistry. Chicken + oven = roast chicken. However, a cake recipe needs to be done a certain way in order to get the right results. Cake mix + egg + oil + water + oven does not always = tasty cake.

8394 2018-04-30 06:01:17 Remember the GFC we paid 2.23 a litre of gas when oil was 100 US per barrel and when it went down to 30US a barrel we were paying only slightly less no questions asked . I. Did happen to scream the fact loudly to MSM but not interested .

8408 2018-04-30 05:59:21 My mom likes to make her on flaxseed oil. But I don't think she's tried the oil.
8409 2018-04-30 05:59:17 tbh any type of cooking oil on ur face seems odd to me, wack suggestion imo, but thank u ill try the rosehip! and the witch hazel u recommended is super gr8
8410 2018-04-30 05:59:17 I was the last carpenter on site when Suncor divorced the French lol and they shut down Voyager because rail was cheaper than rail. CNRL bought out Shell, Suncor took control of Syncrude, China will bail on Nexen lol. This all started years ago, read the price history of oil

8412 2018-04-30 05:58:24 We need to stop taking it out of the ground and stop using it. Solar and wind are already cheaper than the current price, so I guess it is just a matter of time before people realize the oil is not worth the hassle. But we need that time to be shorter, rather than longer.
8413 2018-04-30 05:58:23 they will fade!! & youll learn to love & except bc your baby girl gave them to you. but seriously bio oil is magic .

8419 2018-04-30 05:57:36 Wow Jamie Oliver cooked chicken and pesto. Christ anyone could cook that. Has anyone ever been to Jamie’s Italian? Dull overpriced food. let’s drizzle half a bottle olive oil over everything
8420 2018-04-30 05:57:22 State oil companies have not revised prices of petrol and diesel for the sixth day in a row on Monday. The government had earlier asked oil retailers to hold rates and absorb part of the hike. Really bad news for oil AMCs. Possible downside in #IOCL, #HPCL, #BPCL
8421 2018-04-30 05:57:21 I do need an oil change though 
8422 2018-04-30 05:57:13 Hey the United States are stealing Syria's oil !  I don't care if United States is up Israel's ass but if you aren't invited then you are a terrorist organization and if you give Isis and al Qaeda air support then you are a terrorist too
8423 2018-04-30 05:57:11 Putin is in favor of the USA breaking the Iran agreement. He knows it will drive up the price of oil and Russia desperately needs the price of oil to increase. Whether it's intentional or not is debatable but Trump is helping Putin if the USA drop's the agreement.
8424 2018-04-30 05:57:00 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!

8443 2018-04-30 05:53:09 depends on yr skin type!! but coconut oil is NOT good for a lot of people tbh
8444 2018-04-30 05:52:32 OIL 230.50 buy @231 sl 229
8445 2018-04-30 05:51:54 I’m not arguing with you, doesn’t work for me either. The way you said it just made it sound like the hair cracks from being trapped in solidified coconut oil. It’s probably better used in the scalp since the head provides heat to keep it fluid.

8454 2018-04-30 05:50:46 Kursk was nuclear powered, and probably had nuclear weapons when it blew up and sank. The radiological hazard is not planetarily significant. The problem here is that the reactor would work and power oil rigs to enrich Putin and harm the climate.

8459 2018-04-30 05:48:59 To delve a lil deeper, coconut oil basically is like a wax and doesn’t actually moisturize - it just sits on top of your pores. If you wanna try a new oil, try rosehip!

8480 2018-04-30 05:43:37 They have increased the maximum levy too, so even if oil comes down by any chance, it wont result in an equal decline in prices.

8509 2018-04-30 05:38:06 Looks pretty straight forward to me. Especially if that's pretty much all he does all day. He should try installing some renewables rather than sucking up out of date, polluting oil or gas. Much more rewarding, technical, better for planet and more job security in the future.

8518 2018-04-30 05:36:28 I thought I smelled my car burning oil but it turned out there was just an rx7 next to me
8519 2018-04-30 05:36:21 All I’m saying is, the world went to shit when everyone stopped buying oil from the US & the British Mandates in the ME, and started buying it from the Saudis and Iran

8521 2018-04-30 05:36:21 เบื่อว่ะ
8522 2018-04-30 05:36:12 Negative attitude is just like a burnt engine oil. The longer you keep it running through our system, the more damage it does to our drive.
8523 2018-04-30 05:35:51 We love anchovies, also, @StevenSchirripa ! Especially made in a paste with olive oil on pasta! #BeatBobbyFlay @bflay we would like Mr. Schirripa on your show a lot!

8526 2018-04-30 05:35:23 Things changing fast in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. First, women allowed to drive, then a women’s fashion week is hosted, and now our childhood favorite WWE holds one of its biggest events in the kingdom (women allowed entry). Hopefully king MBS also gets rid of the oil!
8527 2018-04-30 05:35:12 It’s unthinkable for few Indians to win over Inferiority complex about own nation, thot process/ culture wid which generation grew up 40-50 yrs back.

8528 2018-04-30 05:35:05 We have just reached the second step of my tweet, Climate change = more oil. We have many steps to go before our real "Game Over" The clock has not run out yet.
8529 2018-04-30 05:33:41 Jamaican black castor oil with rosemary is my favorite 
8530 2018-04-30 05:33:32 If you’ve ever seen the shape that oil comes out in when you go to change it, it would be a no brainer to change it in my opinion! Pretty cheap insurance vs replacing planetaries
8531 2018-04-30 05:33:28 Coconut oil doesn’t solidify hard enough to break your hair but I find it thin and oily. Just sits on the hair, makes it greasy and it’s too thin to help de tangle.
8532 2018-04-30 05:33:24 Mechanic friends or friends with mechanic friends  would anyone want a cash job to service my swift? Just the basics oil, water, fluids etc??

Why not keep jobs IN Canada by refining Alberta oil IN Alberta?

If Alberta sold jet fuel I'm sure #YVR would prefer to buy #Canadian. Sending dilbit overseas for processing seems no different than exporting raw logs

8575 2018-04-30 05:23:19 @EBRD ... what's happening with oil & gas pipeline grants, subsidies & loans for construction in Eastern Europe ...
8576 2018-04-30 05:23:18 So, a series of multinational oil companies raised the price of your gas dramatically and you blame a new government? Are you suggesting they aren't being interventionist enough?

8587 2018-04-30 05:21:10 Poorer countries have been in war far longer than our region has. Afghanistan has been in war for three decades & has no oil. Alternatively, Norway has a $1 trillion fund from selling oil, & it's one of the most peaceful countries on the planet. They even stayed neutral in WWII.

8589 2018-04-30 05:20:35 It's not about the oil. It's about the people & their ideologies. Oil is an excuse. We have to industrialize our nations & we haven't. We're missing the opportunities left & right, & blame everyone & everything except ourselves. It's on us to fix things. End of story.

To get tan quickly, you'll need to apply a lotion or oil with a low SPF, but you still want to make sure you have some protection from the sun's powerful rays. Choose between rub-on lotions, aerosol sprays, and oil rubs and mists that all contain some SPF.

But Trump and Hillary are different sides of the same coin: they both get paid by the same corporations: Big Pharma, Goldman Sachs, oil companies, weapon’s manufacturers, etc. And no matter how badly FOX or MSNBC refuses to report it’s true.
8813 2018-04-30 04:39:06 Most recpies ask for a crazy amount of oil (hence why pesto is so bad for you). Hold back on the oil and taste as you go. Also don't overdo the raw garlic. Little bit of lemon juice is nice in it. And if it's basil pesto make sure it's fresh

8948 2018-04-30 04:16:11 This is the busiest shutdown season Alberta has ever seen with seven refineries or oil sands operation on large scale shutdowns all at the same time. The prices will come back to reality in a month.
8949 2018-04-30 04:16:05 Also if you have the intelligence to understand the article you will see confirmation that there is more competition in Auckland (leads to lower prices) and possibly some unethical business practices going on by big oil. Nothing to do with Aucklanders so you can piss right off 
8950 2018-04-30 04:15:33 แกร่งแล้วจะทำอะไรก็ได้
8951 2018-04-30 04:15:16 Alberta has never found it easy to look in the mirror. Alberta's 70s economy was a high-oil-price bubble. It was bound to pop when high oil prices and demand destruction led to a supply glut. Like now, more or less, but (fortunately) accompanied by lower interest rates.
8952 2018-04-30 04:14:43 If you starve people and cut off their fuel their oil necessities. For a moment you will win. But the possible repercussions of Revenge later down the road five six years will be harsh. No wonder we want a travel ban in place. Some of these countries oh us an ass whooping

8959 2018-04-30 04:13:55 I’m not fighting/arguing that. I’m saying facts don’t lie and at this point it’s impossible to say who’s better. It’s just snake oil at this point.
8960 2018-04-30 04:13:46 End of an era of a proper football. Fergie and Wenger brought the best out of the prem league football. Now its the oil money who took over :(
8961 2018-04-30 04:13:43 I hear that. The oil industry affects my paycheques too. Indirectly. As with most people in Alberta.
8962 2018-04-30 04:13:36 Alas... the U.S. waging war for oil is complete and utter rubbish claim... if anything it was the nations opposing the action in Iraq that did so for oil. But keep trying to perpetuate promarxist lies.... There are plenty of reasons to criticise the Iraq war, but that isn't one
8963 2018-04-30 04:13:25 And that is the problem. He is only thinking and not doing it. Govt should immediately privatize all banks, Oil companies, LIC and other govt owned businesses. Just 2 stations out of thousands is nothing.

8966 2018-04-30 04:12:33 Although I will say that raw untreated sewage being dumped on a daily basis is a much bigger environmental issue than a possible oil spill that may never happen. That's my opinion and I think @jjhorgan, if he really cared for the environment, would fight the bigger problem first.

8980 2018-04-30 04:10:22 it’s based off an old af practice where you swish oil (most common is coconut oil) in your mouth for 15-20 mins. The oil pulls out toxins from your body and it can whiten your teeth too! You have to spit it out in a napkin when your done bc you’d swallow toxins which is a no!

9046 2018-04-30 03:58:38 I am also aware that Alberta is in a tough situation, because for far too long, both the oil industry and the government never bothered to plan for other markets. and now the US doesn't need as much of our oil, and we have no other markets, because we have no other pipelines.

9086 2018-04-30 03:51:00 Trump has been wrong so often that it's not even worth discussing. But 1) the practice of invading counties for natural resources has long been shelved, & 2) the price tag isn't justified. The US spent $2.4 trillion in the Iraq war. You can't make that from oil money.

9091 2018-04-30 03:50:06 If it wasn't for how bad Oil Ocean still was in Mania I could understand why one might want to see remakes of notoriously bad levels that aren't, well, terrible lol
9092 2018-04-30 03:50:04 If I was the oil company executive I would be scared as fuck, knowing it would only take a few seconds before the world pull the wool for their sleepy eyes. 
Who you know doin it like I do. I spit live like I’m AI. I promise. I don’t do it for profit. I do it for love.
9093 2018-04-30 03:49:44 Excusez-moi - the langue d'oïl northerners stole those words from us in Languedoc. Your form n'est pas valide!
9094 2018-04-30 03:49:34 What's that? North Korea has oil?
9095 2018-04-30 03:49:34 Prices are also decided by taxation ...   In International market rate of crude oil in 2014 was 110$/barrel ...  Which is now 84$/barrel ...  ..  UPA used to give subsidies on Petrol&diseal..  now there is more than 70% of tax on them ....

9097 2018-04-30 03:49:16 Refined oil might be doable, depending on the shipping.
9098 2018-04-30 03:49:14 You bake stuff in the same pans, so I assume it's as sanitary as that. I'd be more worried about spilling the oil or burning the bottom of the pan and starting a fire, but if it's single use, it might be fine.
9099 2018-04-30 03:48:58 He doesn't eat processed foods either and only uses olive oil. Apparently potatoes were never as big as they are today so it has to be the xs carbs.

9101 2018-04-30 03:48:42 Do you know what I hate?!? Cold sores I hate these bitches! Damn it peppermint oil to the rescue!

9103 2018-04-30 03:48:36 .Have you ever dipped your head in oil and rubbed it on Joy Reid?
9104 2018-04-30 03:48:22 The rare times I get a sunburn. I use lavender or rose oil on it and it helps with the sting and redness
9105 2018-04-30 03:48:01 I have two versions of my wash day routine. One where I go all out - oil treatment, pre-poo & deep conditioner. The other, what I just did, is me just washing it and two strand twists lol
9106 2018-04-30 03:47:57 You terrorist, go check oil in your truck. Twitter and blogs are public forums and i have as much right to express myself as anyone else. If she is gonna spread lies, someone has to call her out.

9109 2018-04-30 03:47:28 The irony is that foreign oil companies (mostly American) pay less than $10 a barrel royalty to Canada to extract OUR oil. No Canada is not allowed by "Big Brother" (CIA) to have our own oil company or our own car. BTW the world price for the lowest grade oil is $64 a barrel.
9110 2018-04-30 03:47:01 If it was filled with oil you would end up bombing yourself

9122 2018-04-30 03:45:31 once China got on board and imposed heavy sanctions on north korea he has no choice but to cave....so much oil and food came from China...president Xi deserves a ton of credit
9123 2018-04-30 03:45:28 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9124 2018-04-30 03:44:56 The Bay of Pigs, installing the Shah of Iran, the list goes on almost endlessly of what we have done in the last 200 years. I believe China is finally making North Korea use common sense. Be a nice guy United States will back off of us and you will get money food oil fuel.
9125 2018-04-30 03:44:53 今日で一旦帰宅してまた2日後に来ます 自分でもちょっと何言ってるかよく分からない
9126 2018-04-30 03:44:37 "Oh. Hello there. You enjoying a quiet night too?"

I tend to the blade wiping the polishing oil onto it.
9127 2018-04-30 03:44:31 The Garnier Micellar water w Argan oil smells so goooooood  and it takes off my makeup so much more smoothly than the previous ones I’ve had
9128 2018-04-30 03:44:31 Pretty hard to watch the Oilers miss the playoffs this year, then I watch games like these and think the Oil arent even close to a team that could battle like this.
9129 2018-04-30 03:44:27 I feel better after having curry for dinner but I also inhaled a small pool of chili oil oh no
9130 2018-04-30 03:44:17 まちねーまちねー！！
9131 2018-04-30 03:44:03 That should do it. A few drops of peppermint oil on a hanky helps me too. I have WHOLE pregnant girl symptoms in vehicles and I ain’t pregnant!
9132 2018-04-30 03:43:51 If making kale chips means burning kale in the oven with a light drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt then yes I did just make kale chips

9135 2018-04-30 03:43:08 Because decades of prior Admins made wall street a priority, at the expense of our working middle class.

We demonized our oil industry.  We offshored our mfg.  Executives, wall street love the margins.  

We have to expand our middle class, its been shrinking since the 70's.

9141 2018-04-30 03:41:37 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
9142 2018-04-30 03:41:37 I need a method to help grow my eyebrows. Besides castor oil. 
9143 2018-04-30 03:41:37 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9155 2018-04-30 03:40:00 Guess the prople in metro areas dont no diddly about most of canada and i would suggest that most of the oil pipeline protesters dont understand this as they never had to work.

9158 2018-04-30 03:39:17 เราไม่รู้ว่าเธอจะเป็นไง แต่ของเรายุบอยู่นะ เลยใช้แต่ยี่ห้อนี้ตลอด บางทีก็ใช้ tea tree oil ของ bodyshop
9159 2018-04-30 03:39:15 who told you an olive oil is a soup? you heretic! it's actually a kind of cocktail
9160 2018-04-30 03:38:56 As far as i know, gasoline is not brought to BC by pipeline. We are seeing the same gasoline prices as when oil was 150$+. There's more at play here.
9161 2018-04-30 03:38:53 I got this raspberry hazelnut salad dressing and a lemon olive oil herb one too lol
9162 2018-04-30 03:38:20 I'd love to oil you down, very slowly. Gorgeous body

9166 2018-04-30 03:37:34 Hmm...you should pray over your room and anoint the place with anointing/anointed oil...that should help remove the spirit and/or stop it from coming back.
Let me know how it goes.
9167 2018-04-30 03:37:32 Ugh. Vanillin condensation seems to be a failure so far. Upon recrystallizing the yellow solid formed by the addition of acid, a black oil seemed to be present which dissolved upon adding more solvent and reheating.
9168 2018-04-30 03:37:27 ethen: do u have any oil free face lotion  
me : nah, i use coconut oil on my face 
ethen: is that oi...
me: if you ask if that’s oil free imma slap you 
9169 2018-04-30 03:37:02 Sliced the fuck out of my finger then got it packed full of OBM then used dirt to get the oil base off my hands and packed it full of dirt smhhh, I should start wearing gloves
9170 2018-04-30 03:36:50 Get it together people: The deal with Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor has the wrong ticker on most of the articles tonight. $MPC $ANDV
@MarathonPetroCo is $MPC -- not $MRO which is Marathon Oil.
9171 2018-04-30 03:36:32 Can't we just create millions of new jobs in an increasingly autonomous  world & lessen our dependence on foreign oil because it's a good thing to do, & not because we have to resolve the climate change debate? I mean, just about every auto maker is rolling out alt fuel vehicles.
9172 2018-04-30 03:35:53 things i hear at work: 

"can't you just keep my car running while you change the oil?"
9173 2018-04-30 03:35:49 gusto ko na talagang mag oil painting huehue
9174 2018-04-30 03:35:44 Just got an email from someone who identified himself with one initial--I--asking if I could hook him up with some extra virgin olive oil. I was tempted to send him to Uncle Vito Corleone but thought better of it.
9175 2018-04-30 03:35:41 Flour, bread crumbs, almond milk, garlic powder, and olive oil!
9176 2018-04-30 03:35:32 しっかしウリエル人権石じゃねえか
9177 2018-04-30 03:35:13 We should have poured oil on the wall, then watched them slide down.  So tired of people coming here illegally.  If they wanted asylum, they should have gotten it from the first country they traveled to.  This is an invasion.

9180 2018-04-30 03:34:39 Yes, it’s disconnected from Mexican voters, because it’s not an article about Mexican voters. It’s an article about what the oil industry thinks about the election.
9181 2018-04-30 03:34:15 เฮ้ออออ
9182 2018-04-30 03:34:12 My bf use to laugh at me because I would use peppermint oil for headaches and would only fall asleep with my thunder noise. Now he’s asking for all those things so he can sleep 
9183 2018-04-30 03:34:09 tfw u cook in ur pjs n now ur pj shirt smells like olive oil
9184 2018-04-30 03:34:09 No, Karen, tea tree oil and some crystals will not treat mental illnesses. Do you understand that they are caused by a lack of SPECIFIC CHEMICALS in the BRAIN? Can you not understand this because you're lacking a brain entirely?
9185 2018-04-30 03:34:01 Experiment with stir-fry, baking, steaming, grating, and grilling veggies. Different cooking methods bring out rich and sweet flavors. Use a little olive oil, which is a source of good fat and helps your body better take in certain vitamins. #healthyeating
9186 2018-04-30 03:33:59 @ASMRAngel ok I have a rice tip, dont use oil, I only use oil when i fry it. Try using butter instead.
9187 2018-04-30 03:33:56 Yeah, um, an Anglo male WSJ employee's insistence to lecture us about this, w shifting points of contention (my opinion, Amlo statements, Amlo proposals) kinnnda just helps prove my overall point. #tonedeaf #misplaced #gringos #oil #mediabias #mediaelite #privilege #Mexico #bye

9190 2018-04-30 03:32:05 If you apply a little heat with a hairdryer then use a little bit of eucalyptus oil on a towel it’ll rub right off any surface 
9191 2018-04-30 03:31:46 That’s why I can’t cut it ... same dude I hate it, but just gotta remember your hair needs your natural oil.
9192 2018-04-30 03:31:15 Stop playing with me like I won’t put hot oil on your dick bitch 
9193 2018-04-30 03:31:09 I love the people of Arizona, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

9199 2018-04-30 03:30:12 When you’re dealing with the challenging demands of the daily grind, having a moment of harmony and peace is essential for your overall well-being and mental health. Sandalwood oil, with its amazing woody aroma, has a powerful therapeutic effects.
9200 2018-04-30 03:30:04 From a bullion banking default perspective, would a lack of mined physical speed up the demise ? Because I think the miners are going to make new all time lows with these oil prices and with some credit market tightness. Soon.

9203 2018-04-30 03:29:04 This weekend I changed the oil  on my mower, replaced the starter solenoid, took out the carburetor for cleaning, ran a hot wire to the fuel solenoid, cleared some blockage in the fuel line, diagnosed a problem with the vaccum tubing on the fuel pump, and hotwired the mower.
9204 2018-04-30 03:28:51 Finally bought an oil diffuser and it’s my favorite thing ever
9205 2018-04-30 03:28:17 The Democratic Party supports wars for oil. How is that being pro environment?
9206 2018-04-30 03:28:17 Fossil fuel corporates r given monopoly that they been changing price few times a day. With 20-30 yrs oil reserves left on planet these politicians should be implementing alternatives already not ranting about setting sun of fossil fuels
9207 2018-04-30 03:28:08 tryna slick a can of oil who you think you fooling?
9208 2018-04-30 03:27:50 Has anyone tried rosehip oil? What’s good?
9209 2018-04-30 03:27:47 An oil lobbyist is in charge of the EPA, an investor in predatory student loans is in charge of the Department of Education, a man who thinks he has a mainline to god is VP, and a war criminal is National Security Advisor. And you want me to get mad at a comedian? #WHCD

9217 2018-04-30 03:26:46 Mr. Fleury and many of his followers seem to be advocating for a made-in-Canada price for oil. That is what the NEP was about, but I'm guessing that the same people are still complaining about the NEP. And ridiculing Venezuela.

9226 2018-04-30 03:24:54 It's more than that. Trains are a much more hazardous way to transport oil. They somehow think if we use dirty foreign oil it's somehow better for the environment.
9227 2018-04-30 03:24:49 i’ve been using this tea tree oil on my skin w/o diluting it... and i burned my skin  i didn’t know.
9228 2018-04-30 03:24:43 Oil & gas already savaged by the reality of changing technology no matter how hard you try to pump it up?

Economies completely dependent on trade and interaction with a Western world you are trying to make war on?

9232 2018-04-30 03:23:55 I think Putin may be involved... he has been sneaking Kim oil, so it has me wondering.
9233 2018-04-30 03:23:54 I wish I am with you to spread the lotion and baby oil all over your body and especially on your amazing breast

9235 2018-04-30 03:23:28 I just watched a tear jerker on @WatchCTVNews. Sky high gasoline prices in Vancouver. Sure wish I could sympathize but there is help available. It’s called Trans Mountain Pipeline. Or you can keep driving to the US, who get their oil by, wait for it, tanker.

9237 2018-04-30 03:23:20 Who can fathom all the intersection information related to oil industry and presenting it in a way that makes sense is what I call a skillful analyst.
The part where and how to find someone is a deferent story
9238 2018-04-30 03:23:20 Now playing: Incubus - Oil And Water
9239 2018-04-30 03:23:08 Yeah we do; we are transitioning off oil/gas for cars and charging with Hydro power. Taxis are hybrid here and public transit/electric buses (not trolley) that charge in 5 mins are on trial right now+ the past years, hydro power stations have been installed on municipal lands
9240 2018-04-30 03:23:02 Small bottle of an oil of ur choice (I used almond oil) + crushed up highlighter!!!! I had a broken wet n wild one laying around so it got put to good use!! Their highlighters are so good and inexpensive so u don’t feel bad about crushing it up!!

9244 2018-04-30 03:22:43 yeah its not a big deal we just put tea tree oil on them to kill them and they fall off within a day.
9245 2018-04-30 03:22:35 You can't use the words "truth" & " @MSNBC " in the same sentence. Oil & water don't mix. IJS

9247 2018-04-30 03:22:32 Brian these are prices that we saw when oil was welcomed$100 a barrel it via currently $68 total rip off
9248 2018-04-30 03:22:30 But how do you dry up he oil without drying up the water to
9249 2018-04-30 03:22:09 It sounds cheesy and new-age but the ONLY thing that knocks out my stress induced mouth sores asap is coconut oil. I rub the virgin cold pressed coconut oil (from Trader Joe's with no added ingredients) all over those suckers and it works immediately. Instant relief.
9250 2018-04-30 03:22:06 @GasBuddyDan this is bullshit gas should be very low world wide collusion more oil in this world than they know what to do with. Go solar and electric. Stop plastics also killing this world oil is
9251 2018-04-30 03:21:50 Don't forget he has ruled before and had the oil purse under his arm pit. What happened to million dollars that got missing? Don't forget he also headed PTF oil purse under Abacha's military junta and even denied that his partner in crime did not loot the nation's treasure.

9253 2018-04-30 03:21:31 I'll never forget what one of my engineering profs. told me long ago...  we'll never run out of oil.  There will always be that last drop.  What will happen is it will become more and more expensive to recover.

9256 2018-04-30 03:20:55 For the supporters of this axis, Qatar had too long tried to broaden its influence in the changing Middle East and North Africa region. Indeed, Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo are all going through periods of instability. Beirut has lost its place as the big business and oil assets
9257 2018-04-30 03:20:50 They don't want oil. We should be finding other solutions.
9258 2018-04-30 03:20:26 Shoplifting oil from an auto parts store in Turlock? Sounds about right. When Silicon Valley mentions your hometown.
9259 2018-04-30 03:20:02 Been taking cbd oil to combat my spot growing in my chest. Am using Ginseng, retonic acid & need to go to Germany for a cure for the emphysema. Am gonna quit smoking & I read vitamin a helps heal scar tissue.  #Cigarettes #TheTruth #Quitsmoking

9261 2018-04-30 03:19:49 Sad thing is that oil is #fossilfuel that will kill the planet.
9262 2018-04-30 03:19:45 Yeah but you don't buy a car and buy a new one when you need an oil change. We as a society have forgotten that life needs maintenance.
9263 2018-04-30 03:19:38 For the fellas that might scroll thru water and extra virgin olive oil is simple and easy
9264 2018-04-30 03:19:21 I got me some new scents 4 my oil burner my house bout 2 smell lovely
9265 2018-04-30 03:19:14 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
9266 2018-04-30 03:18:59 I get having oily skin.

I get having dry skin.

bUT WHAT I *DONT* GET IS HAVING 98% OF MY SKIN PRODUCING ENOUGH OIL TO MAKE A WWE FIGHTER JEALOUS, AND THEN HAVING HANDS THAT LOOK LIKE CRACKED LEATHER AFTER 30 MIN EXPOSURE TO 45 DEGREE WEATHER
9267 2018-04-30 03:18:59 After 4 days, my hives are FINALLY almost gone. Memo to all getting massages: find out what’s in your masseuse’s oil before you let them put it on your body.  #massage #sensativeskinproblems #iblametheirish

9271 2018-04-30 03:18:04 poliitics, by its very nature is deceitful and hurtful.  I believe that righteous Jewish citizens have a responsibility to tap roots and gusher Light where others desire to gusher oil. The Light illuminates the darkness and the enlightenment to help voters make their decision.
9272 2018-04-30 03:17:52 Drink plenty of water and use coconut oil lol
9273 2018-04-30 03:17:22 I go thru a shit ton of coconut oil so I have hella jars. I use them as mason jars or to hold random things  #Reuse 
9274 2018-04-30 03:17:13 Yes! As a parent of a child who has been treated with medical cannabis since she was 3 years old, the reaction when others learn about her oil has changed drastically in the past few years.  Now they usually have great questions or ask about how to help for a loved one.
9275 2018-04-30 03:17:03 I know the oil field happy lol
9276 2018-04-30 03:17:01 Read BIBLE,pray, spread the Gospel, love one another,heart check, the word of God! Oil fill your lamps  Always keep your eyes up,and waiting 
9277 2018-04-30 03:17:00 Back on the grind tomorrow!! Clean eating and oil pulling wooo!! I gotta whitten my teeth again
9278 2018-04-30 03:17:00 My car feels like a different car after the attentive oil change it just had!! so epic haha

9281 2018-04-30 03:16:43 very helpful piece. What about mustard oil? 

Also, if peanut oil is a no-no, does that apply to peanuts as well?
9282 2018-04-30 03:16:26 Looking at the rest Horgan should wear it personally over his stance on Canadian oil.
9283 2018-04-30 03:16:18 Oil producers are always right?  Are you talking about Harold Hamm?  I do admit the seasonals I watch switched to a bearish model input to me last Friday #OOTT
9284 2018-04-30 03:16:17 Man, I was trying to figure out why gas has been so expensive lately, and then I remembered, “oh right, that oil refinery exploded.”
9285 2018-04-30 03:16:13 Just to put it in perspective, that is $6.136/gallon at 161.9/litre.   

As for blaming Governments, seriously people do a LITTLE reading... how about blaming the bloody oil companies? Or does that go against your agenda?
9286 2018-04-30 03:16:13 im really out here steaming my face, sipping tea, watching netflix and doing a hot oil hair treatment like i don’t have 3 tests and a project this week
9287 2018-04-30 03:15:50 I’ve had good luck with using vitamin C serum, and then a tinted moisturizer for day or moisturizing oil for night
9288 2018-04-30 03:15:42 "Back then, the fire had been built from wood his father had cut himself, and if it had been slow to light, they’d fed the flames with used motor oil from a five-gallon drum in the garage, which had given a healthy, carcinogenic flavor to the meal."

9292 2018-04-30 03:15:02 Bush LIED about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It was only for the greed of oil.
9293 2018-04-30 03:14:44 Unfortunately, Trich doesn't have a cure or quick cure that I know of.
Therapy can help, change your environment and try new places (a quiet library?), when you find yourself in a pulling phase, try to take a walk. 
Put oil on pulling areas to make pulling more difficult.

9295 2018-04-30 03:14:39 Oil is up $20/barrel in just 8 months. Lot of headwinds on growth of late, from the Fed rate to OPEC to inflation.

9299 2018-04-30 03:14:16 Yup, if corps own water. But as a public resource w infrastru built using tax dollars why would it cost what gouging oil co's charge for diesel. Plus, not mined or refined, so v little production cost.

Also, my understanding, once pump up over dividing range, all downhill. Free.
9300 2018-04-30 03:13:39 I know straight-up Olive oil is a good moisturizer, but WTF is up w/this woo? (says one who"s found acupuncture helpful)
9301 2018-04-30 03:13:36 This is not the case at all. The world has reached “peak oil” about once a decade since the 1930s. The malthusians predicted global mass starvation at least 3 billion people and 50 yrs ago. Africa needs 1st-world governance in order to enjoy 1st-world std of living. It’s doable.
9302 2018-04-30 03:13:27 I agree they shouldn’t be thrown on the ice. They should be rolled in corn meal and thrown in hot peanut oil. #GTFOof here
9303 2018-04-30 03:13:26 Dogs and truffle oil pizza?? This may be all I need to exist.
9304 2018-04-30 03:13:26 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

9307 2018-04-30 03:13:20 Day 1 of vegetarian diet week: Ate nothing but bagels with nutella and peanut butter until dinner, which is spaghetti with avocado pesto. Fucked up the pesto by not realizing that the bottom was screwed in wrong, oil and lemon juice oozes out. Parmesan may have been a bad idea.
9308 2018-04-30 03:13:07 I got the oil in the boat.
9309 2018-04-30 03:12:58 Wtf kind of essential oil smells like crawfish
9310 2018-04-30 03:12:54 I like to use tea tree oil since I have oil skin and I like rose hip oil. Andalou naturals has a really nice rose moisturizer that smells really good. I rlly wanna try Clare's brand Majo medicine but it's $60 including shipping KAJSJSJ
9311 2018-04-30 03:12:52 China just official gain another Big desperated customer ( North Korea).

9317 2018-04-30 03:12:07 This is an important. Also, it’s tangential to the oil majors’ worries about the reform being slowed or reversed. Mexico could have opened the upstream without removed gasoline subsidies, which would’ve avoided lots of trouble. Amlo is contemplating much bigger steps backward.
9318 2018-04-30 03:11:58 The reporters that acknowledge and make corrections to stories are much more noble than the snake oil salesman commander in chief and his house of liars. Fixing a problem the first time is a solution. Doing the same problem becomes a habit.
9319 2018-04-30 03:11:41 Damn coconut oil does wonders lol
9320 2018-04-30 03:11:17 Have you ever tried deep blue by doTERRA. It’s an essential oil rub. Like icy hot but waayyyy better.
9321 2018-04-30 03:11:02 I’ve been trying to figure out why my purse smells whack for about 2 months now (basically like boiled crawfish if ur from here) WELL my bf stuck an antibacterial essential oil mix in my purse & the whole bottle spilled in it.... aka my kate spade will forever stink
9322 2018-04-30 03:10:59 .@CBCSunday 
Chris Turner says #cdnpoli needs a clean slate regarding Canada's approach to #climatechange. Let's see massive public investments in green technology - energy, cars, homes, public transit etc, you know, like the oil industry gets from taxpayers.

9326 2018-04-30 03:10:28 Price at the pump has nothing to do with the price of oil. It’s based on consumer sentiment of the economy and what the oil companies think they can squeeze out of the consumer. Higher pump prices actually condition people into thinking the economy is better so they will pay more

9330 2018-04-30 03:10:12 Also, it’s far from clear how the energy reform has “played out.” We’re less than a year past the first deepwater auctions, and barely any of the fields awarded to foreign nationals have yielded any oil. Main results so far are gasolinazo and better gas station minimarts.

Here are two examples of resource wars:

The 1991 Gulf war was (in part) caused by disputes over oil drilling along the border.

The South China Sea conflict is (in part) over who gets the undersea resources there.

one refinery has an explosion and everyone that works for a living has to pay for it.
I will never get this oil business.
9339 2018-04-30 03:08:01 There's many different routes of administration available. I've read Patrick Stewart uses some kind of cannabis oil for his arthritis.
9340 2018-04-30 03:07:54 Just make sure to run your fingernail over your skin first (just enough to get some of your skin's oil under your fingernail.) I'm not sure why, but it's as if you're breaking a barrier over your skin. Your skin will exfoliate so much more with these rags if you do that first!

9367 2018-04-30 03:04:03 Why then, has, my dear friend, the one who is so confident of winning in 2019 #LS elections directed oil companies to keep oil prices unchanged since Tuesday last? For winning #Karnataka elections?
9368 2018-04-30 03:03:51 Happy journey......

Good to put in hot water and have a bath.....in Mumbai we don't get good quality #N.oil

9370 2018-04-30 03:03:34 Weibo Ludlow was eventually proven innocent. The oil company admitted to setting it up to look like he did it.

9377 2018-04-30 03:02:07 Us Canucleheads have to wake up and realize we are being gouged, not just by oil companies but also our governments are taxing us up to wazoo on gas. They can push electric vehicles to the masses a lot faster but oil producing nations have our politicians by the balls real hard.

9380 2018-04-30 03:01:06 Nice lying @pepsi. Saying your part of RSPO sustainable palm oil, and yet  your company was just found out to have purchased palm oil from a company that cleared 1000s of acres of Indonesia. Home to 100s of endangered species. Nice genocide..

9383 2018-04-30 03:01:02 @HotRodWidow When I get a chance, I'd like to make something from my childhood: Mom's tuna casserole: Tuna in oil, large elbow mac, sage, black pepper, and a white bechamel-like cheese sauce. That's it. So simple, so comforting, so good!
9384 2018-04-30 03:00:48 I’m an oil Prince from Arabia. I will make you this world empress if you merely become my wife.

9388 2018-04-30 03:00:25 CBD oil has been touted to work miracles & I've tried several different types for my arthritis & fibromyalgia.  I have FINALLY found one that is absolutely fantastic & the results have had me feeling great with much less pain & more energy.  It's been amazing, so I had to share!
9389 2018-04-30 03:00:21 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
9390 2018-04-30 02:59:46 We should hold a Congressional hearing on that. I’m going to start the Coalition for Authentic Olive Oil Labeling.
9391 2018-04-30 02:59:37 "Drink the moter oil rabbit "
9392 2018-04-30 02:59:35 Coconut oil is great for when you’ve stripped your hair of its natural proteins, aka me. Vitamin e, olive/grapeseed oil, & jbco are flameeee too tho
9393 2018-04-30 02:59:21 i was back home watching the series with my Mom. You were my favourite player back then even though I played as a LW in minor hockey. Loved those hard working Oil teams
9394 2018-04-30 02:59:15 Your happy with your prez selling the country to big oil ? And making money off being president? And all the lies he tells or how he treats women and minorities?
9395 2018-04-30 02:59:06 Let me tell you something.I tried with & without primer, with & without the Wake & Bake Oil. And I’m telling you, if you get the chance GET THE OIL. I didn’t experience any issues, no flaking, no patchiness and the foundation blended well with the oil.
9396 2018-04-30 02:58:58 @tomreuter76: I need help, what’s a Spanish food that I can bring to my Spanish class tomorrow? 
Me: Bread and olive oil. 

I miss Spain and the never ending amounts of bread my host family had
9397 2018-04-30 02:58:53 This hot oil treatment feels like sex
9398 2018-04-30 02:58:43 It is in the U.S.’s best interest to landlock Cdn oil, since they are investing like crazy in their own oil production and get our oil cheap. And by the way, it’s called OIL SANDS.

9400 2018-04-30 02:58:19 Tyj for a weekend with good weather because I really needed to change my oil
9401 2018-04-30 02:58:16 aj got annoyed at me asking for kisses because "i ate too much pasta and my lips are covered in olive oil and he doesn't want any second hand olive oil on his mouth"
9402 2018-04-30 02:58:09 You need my man oil
9403 2018-04-30 02:58:06 Go to motherhood maternity and get body boost. I use the oil and shower scrub. 35 weeks no stretch marks 
9404 2018-04-30 02:58:01 And it’s sadly never *real* olive oil

Why is nobody talking about the lack of olive oil regulation?
9405 2018-04-30 02:57:56 PLEASE DONT DO THIS!! Those pans aren't made to get that hot, made carcinogens in that oil 
9406 2018-04-30 02:57:49 Is olive oil the new avocado toast?
9407 2018-04-30 02:57:30 The danger of working in an industrial area is that you have to be careful where you walk, otherwise you may not see that oil slick on the ground and both your bum and your pride may get hurt
9408 2018-04-30 02:57:24 Cbd can also be used to reverse the effects of a bad weed trip I have used it many times. I find the syrup works best for me, my mom uses the cbd vape oil & she has worse chronic pain than me & it helps her cope
9409 2018-04-30 02:57:24 Sprinkled with paprika, good olive oil, and eaten with a warm pita.
9410 2018-04-30 02:57:08 "Moter oil drink that"
9411 2018-04-30 02:56:57 Me: Pseudoscience is such bullshit take a bio class you idiot. 
Also me: If my oil diffuser doesn't make my room smell like lavender in 1 minute I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown
9412 2018-04-30 02:56:57 Retinoid\retinol\retin-a creams.  It's prescription or OTC in the women's beauty section.   Salicylic acid has always made that crap worse for me, benzoyl peroxide made my skin super dry.  Tea tree oil kinda works too.  I think retinoids work best out of all of those things tho.
9413 2018-04-30 02:56:47 , I'm bout to come hop on the oil rig.
9414 2018-04-30 02:56:47 “Get ready for some tweets, folks! Just gotta do some research first, then on Monday I’m getting my oil changed. Tuesday I’m hitting Costco. But on Wednesday...”
9415 2018-04-30 02:56:26 Toyotas don’t require oil changes.
9416 2018-04-30 02:56:25 I’d say that’s reasonable for dipping olive oil. The one you want to savor. You probably don’t want to cook with that one.
9417 2018-04-30 02:56:25 It wasn’t bad! I marinated ground pork with lots of ginger (plus sugar salt fish sauce and rice vinegar), fried, added green onion & baby boy choy. And half an apple. Then added noodles, dressed with soy, rice vin and toasted sesame oil. Garnish with green onion and sesame seeds.
9418 2018-04-30 02:56:08 The fact Eastern Canada prefers oil in support of dictatorial regimes is their choice. The fact they take it a step further & deliberately stop Canada’s oil exports is the issue. Why should the oil-producing provinces remain in this oppressive Confederation?
9419 2018-04-30 02:56:02 actually, calling it 'now' is generous to the govt. The current arrangement of permits means we'll most likely have an oil and gas industry for the next 40 years. If we haven't moved past our dependency on oil and gas in 50 - we're fucked.
9420 2018-04-30 02:55:44 I keep saying drone skunk oil to the boarder and make it repulsive to get near the us line
9421 2018-04-30 02:55:36 YAS! This post make me so happy! You're flawless  Dang I should have ordered the oil too 
9422 2018-04-30 02:55:19 tonight; roast chicken
roast potatoes & carrots w/ olive oil, s & p, garlic powder & parsley
9423 2018-04-30 02:55:08 garlic is truly magical. I do mine roasted in balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, S&P. fantastic
9424 2018-04-30 02:54:58 Ditto, but in the "too many snake oil salesman" vein.  Twitternets are full of 'em.
9425 2018-04-30 02:54:57 I really gotta be more diligent with asking places if they cook with peanut oil 
9426 2018-04-30 02:54:55 My response to this was pseudo intellectual garbage so I deleted it. 

I too want to stop hearing about beard oil all the time. 

Pls

9431 2018-04-30 02:54:42 Wow my dumbass really let myself get tea tree oil in my eye
9432 2018-04-30 02:54:26 Foreign Money is paying for the Anti oil lobby causing this. Make no mistake this is an economic assault on our country
9433 2018-04-30 02:54:13 yeah I've had whanau work in oil and gas too - who hasn't in the Naki? But at some point we've got to move past it -  like, there isn't really an option there. I don't see why that time can't be now.
9434 2018-04-30 02:54:07 I’m ready for my baby to come home to me & have some baby oil time 
9435 2018-04-30 02:53:57 I’ve tried organic coconut oil but it dried my hair tbh.. I think less hair cuts is the key, unless you desperately need one & see nothin but split ends
9436 2018-04-30 02:53:55 いきて！
9437 2018-04-30 02:53:41 To tackle climate change we have to think global and act local. Restricting global supply AND demand of fossil fuels at same time is reinforcing. On supply side, if NZ found lge new oil reserves it wd add to global supply, and drive down price and undermine demand side efforts
9438 2018-04-30 02:53:30 自分も車の中でOIL！OIL！叫んでました
9439 2018-04-30 02:53:14 I’m gonna pick it up this weekend shouldn’t take to long to pull the engine. Either have a broken rocker or spun a bearing I assume it’s a bearing since my oil pressure light is on. Haven’t dug into it yet don’t really want to lol

9441 2018-04-30 02:52:57 @realDonaldTrump all the damn credit because you're a w**** a snake oil salesman a failure
9442 2018-04-30 02:52:52 really? omg is it helping? i’ve also heard bio oil works amazing but it’s so expensive.
9443 2018-04-30 02:52:39 Parmesan & herb infused olive oil for dipping bread. 
9444 2018-04-30 02:52:32 Brilliant article. Doesn't really help convince me of expanding oil production as a policy though.
9445 2018-04-30 02:51:57 It was weird but in a way we still are. Like I tweeted earlier, I hope this controversy dies down because like many topics today it’s like a bad combination of oil slick & battery acid. But what people need to do more than ever in these times is forgive each other. From a friend.

9467 2018-04-30 02:46:50 650,000. Number of barrels of oil imported into eastern Canada EVERY DAY. Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Angola, Algeria key suppliers. Human & women's rights abusers. We could instead export Cdn oil & infuse $-billions into Cdn economy for everyone's benefit. You choose foreign oil.
9468 2018-04-30 02:46:39 Chef McElroy cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with sushi.
9469 2018-04-30 02:46:38 really that's intelligent -all those goodies from china that stock your store shelves gone - the beef that Alberta exports would stop-all of that Central Canada Grain would just clog up the train tracks if it can't be shipped 2) Kinder oil goes to Wash State from BC=Reality check
9470 2018-04-30 02:46:34 Trump is so broke, how broke is he? He has to fly failed business class. Trump is so broke, how broke is he, he looks for foreign oil in Trump Jr's hair.

I was 10 years old, been die-hard Oil fan ever since...
9487 2018-04-30 02:43:53 While not as high at $1.37 per litre in Ontario. This is the same price it was when oil was $135 per barrel. The big difference is CAD down vs USD leading to inflation. This is because @bankofcanada won’t raise rates. This is the start. Food will cost a lot more next.

9490 2018-04-30 02:43:35 It’s the thing I miss most living in Florida. In Maine, I could walk down any street in springtime and inhale that glorious scent.  Now I have to make do with essential oil.
9491 2018-04-30 02:43:33 How much is too much to spend on olive oil

9496 2018-04-30 02:43:01 Hah, snap! Ouch, I can even feel that burn. Mr. Tyrmand I recommend Tea Tree and Lavender Oil for that burn you assuredly are experiencing. Your shirt is torn as well so you might wanna replace it.
9497 2018-04-30 02:42:51 Day 2 ho. Will let you know if this particular oil is any good. At all.
9498 2018-04-30 02:42:23 I see you care about oil industry consultation, yet you introduced the Anadarko Amendment banning climate protests at sea, without taking it to select committee, without a Ministry of Justice Bill of Rights vet, without any opportunity for the public to give comment....

9503 2018-04-30 02:41:37 I was just thinking this. Who will change their oil?
9504 2018-04-30 02:41:22 How do matadors keep their skin looking so youthful? Oil of ¡Olé!, of course.
9505 2018-04-30 02:41:08 Why dont they regulate the oil markets. Basically the OPEC countries make all the decisions on how much money we need to pay for gas.
9506 2018-04-30 02:41:06 It seemed to be going well until that crack about oil in Eric's hair. That fell flat. From there on out, it was a bit rocky, but there were some big laughs and a bunch of angry, uptight conservatives.
9507 2018-04-30 02:40:58 Laugh out loud. Just got a spam email from someone claiming to have bought all of his all of his olive oil from my factory. Now I have a factory too, Charlie!

9509 2018-04-30 02:40:15 I prefer to cook in butter or ghee. Traditionally, my family has cooked in ghee. Sometimes I use coconut oil (esp on skin). I prefer coconut meat/flour directly in my smoothies.
9510 2018-04-30 02:40:14 Yes, many things are made from oil, a rapidly depleting nonrenewable resource.  A good reason why burning it to generate heat is monumentally stupid.  And dangerous.  And bad for our continued survival.
9511 2018-04-30 02:40:14 get a oil

WHAT IS THIS OIL TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
9512 2018-04-30 02:40:12 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
9513 2018-04-30 02:39:58 Skin products are important, and so is watching what you put on your skin. I like dimethicone, argan oil, and nano-encapsulated retinol, all of which are incredible hydrating ingredients to give you the best look without harming your skin!
9514 2018-04-30 02:39:48 Argan Oil smells a lot like elephant poop and I rub it on my face twice a day. So thanks, dry skin :/
9515 2018-04-30 02:39:47 Once shrimp is marinated cooked in Saucepan with oil or butter etc?
9516 2018-04-30 02:39:25 400 प्रमुख Railway Station बेच दिए,,, सरकारी कंपनी Air India बेच दी,,, रक्षा क्षेत्र में 100% विदेशी निवेश की मंज़ूरी दे दी,,, Indian Oil बेच दिया,,, अब लालकिला भी बेच दिया, कुछ दिन में संसद भी बेच देंगे, आप लोग इसी विकास के तो भूखें थे, लो अब भर लो पेट!
9517 2018-04-30 02:39:15 Sana oil
9518 2018-04-30 02:39:05 I’ve never understood climate change deniers. If they’re wrong, our grandchildren slowly perish on a dying planet. Don’t listen to them and they end up being right, we’ve created millions of new jobs in an increasingly autonomous world and lessen our dependence on foreign oil.
9519 2018-04-30 02:38:57 Tomorrow morning i plan on waking up with the sun and gettin an oil change.

When God gives you one of His bright ideas, He will receive your seemingly insignificant offering, and work a mighty miracle with it.
9524 2018-04-30 02:38:39 “Did you put oil on your eyebrows,” is a thing I responded to with an affirmative just now.
9525 2018-04-30 02:38:29 What are Wars? its nothing but mass murder and destruction that should be against all countries laws! most of the time they are bankers wars for oil and control
9526 2018-04-30 02:38:12 @MadamSecretary If only this was true about oil exploration in the Arctic under Trump administration! #keepitintheground
9527 2018-04-30 02:37:22 Exactly. Mfs never had nothing nice to say about darkskins, niggas really fucked with light skins...but you throw some baby oil on a dark skin and now they appreciated

9536 2018-04-30 02:35:33 Hey Kim get educated and see how most of western Canada’s electricity is generated. While you are at it look at where Ontario gets most of its oil.
9537 2018-04-30 02:35:32 Want to have beautiful #hair - put olive or coconut oil in ur hair twice a week. Put it in, sleep in it, the next day wash it out. I have a big jar on my desk so when I work, I make sure to oil myself fm time to time. You can even put it all over ur skin. Old Indian #beauty trick
9538 2018-04-30 02:35:27 If ONE more person tells me to try yoga for my chronic back pain (I literally physically can't do it bc back and knee problems) or tells me to eat walnuts and CBD oil or "just keep in mind hallucinations/delusions aren't real"  for schizophrenia, I'm gonna beat em with my cane
9539 2018-04-30 02:35:26 I thought BC doesn't use oil? What's to worry about?
9540 2018-04-30 02:35:19 I think Kiel Oil Company is the place to start. It's where the Pence Family got their money to go into Politics till it went bankrupt under mysterious circumstances.
9541 2018-04-30 02:35:16 Incorrect.  Oil use to be $2 barrel and pack of smoke $0.25.  It’s all relative.
9542 2018-04-30 02:35:16 CBD won’t show up. “Although very rare, individuals using unusually large doses of a cannabinoid-rich hemp oil product (1000-2000 mg of hemp oil daily) could theoretically test positive during the initial urinary screen.” There’s 1/10 to 1/300th of the THC in CBD which is legal.

9545 2018-04-30 02:34:58 Most people hype up coconut oil but it’s not for everyone. My hair nor my skin loves it. However, it is perfect for when I shave my legs. Dasssit.

9548 2018-04-30 02:34:31 If we want the apparatus to be frictionless we should apply oil to as many moving parts as possible. 

That is why low fees and a low barrier to entry are essential for efficient payments networks.

9550 2018-04-30 02:34:14 Lies! Super hot water, no soap. Dry. Turn on stove, heat it up, apply butter or olive oil, rub it in and let it cool off!
9551 2018-04-30 02:34:01 are pastels and oil crayons the same type of thing or are pastels wax?
9552 2018-04-30 02:33:36 Least they keep most of the Greek nude man on man oil wrestling out of it.

The sky still is not falling and as I live and lead our family toward a cleaner future, the big oil hired troll Like you, spreads lies.

9571 2018-04-30 02:31:39 Heavy oil is not preferable to light oil and there is plenty of oil reserves in America that no one is running out for a while. I think it's a waste of our time money and resources to try to make it work and pray.

9580 2018-04-30 02:30:12 Good idea to take turmeric with black pepper,and a fat like coconut oil to help with absorption.
9581 2018-04-30 02:30:12 It's kinda funny you mention literacy is it not true that light oil is preferable to heavy oil? And that heavy oil costs more money to refine & transport via pipelines? Why would Asian business pay the surcharges on top of cost to properly turn Alberta oil into useable product hm

9596 2018-04-30 02:28:19 Accidentally amazing lunch. @laurclinn Vego, not vegan. Hard tofu fried in oil. Then I added a sauce made from tikka paste, leftover greek yoghurt and pureed spinach. Comfort food +.
9597 2018-04-30 02:28:05 The thread was about tanker spilt oil. Zero.
9598 2018-04-30 02:27:51 Avocado oil works well
9599 2018-04-30 02:27:46 Agree...but in the meantime, oil producing provinces will be devastated with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and investment capital fleeing to other jurisdictions.

9605 2018-04-30 02:27:21 RT @Will_Bunch: Paul Ryan's cruel firing of a priest who dared mention economic fairness isn't the real scandal. It's that lawmakers want to snuff any mention of their war on poor people from HUD rents to heating oil that finances their 1 Percenter tax (part 1)

9622 2018-04-30 02:25:02 @gilmcgowan Actually guys, the problem is that facts in these discussions are not persuasive. Most people are on a “team”, for or against oil, conservative or liberal, etc, and they stick to that side regardless of the facts in evidence.

9661 2018-04-30 02:19:24 “Caught in a Wewoka Switch” is an old Oklahoma phrase that refers to being lost or confused.        Originated from a train yard in the 1920’s where, during an oil boom, supplies in railroad cars would either be stolen or misplaced.

9696 2018-04-30 02:14:37 The checks are huge. This is why the US is now a vassal State to Globalist Banksters and the Oil Cartel.

9708 2018-04-30 02:12:45 Because some Corrupt Politicians looted tax payers money  and Corrupt people didn’t pay taxes.

9742 2018-04-30 02:05:43 I also asked the lead in flight, and she said the olive oil was leaking out of the bottles even when not opened due to the change in pressure on board. So you may be looking for a different kind of container.

9795 2018-04-30 01:56:28 Did you know gasoline prices in Vancouver would go down if the product came from new Oil Sands refineries instead? Canada does not need to export bitumen if it is refined in the Sands.

9803 2018-04-30 01:55:01 Yep - If salt and water mix so well, sand and oil should mix as well. You are famous but you have no brains whatsoever.

9805 2018-04-30 01:54:33 A guy who hobnobs with the most powerful people on earth, is bankrolled by heirs to a multibillion oil and petrochemical empire, is calling a standup comic who almost nobody had heard of a year ago an “elite.” Irony isn’t dead, it’s the organizing principal of humanity.
9806 2018-04-30 01:54:28 Just spent a half hour walking someone through piercing aftercare for her antieyebrow dermals acting up, because one does not spend 15 yrs in a profession and people just stop asking for help with problems.  Dr bronners tea tree oil soap is a miracle fyi

9808 2018-04-30 01:54:10 Iran is the only country that exports terrorism. So never bring the point that Saudi is supporting terrorism...  Saudi is the #1 country thats against terrorism. If Saudi Arabia was “irrelevant” .... then you wouldn’t have oil dear.

9815 2018-04-30 01:52:49 I wash my sheets and pillow cases with a few drops of lavender oil mixed in 
9816 2018-04-30 01:52:48 Sorry, FINISH the sprouts its olive oil. It burns easily, so no more than about 30 secs heat on the balsamic vinegar

9818 2018-04-30 01:52:36 I mean, most people out here had no idea people just walked away from houses because while we couldn't pay oil bills, the policy erased their livelihoods as Terry described. 

We do a bad job teaching this in Canada. Too regionally focused instead of comprehensive.
9819 2018-04-30 01:52:30 I need a place to do my oil change

9822 2018-04-30 01:51:55 And he did bob the shit out of them ISIS who Obama and Clinton created. Your guy wouldn’t even bomb the oil trucks because of the smoke. He dropped leaflets to tell people to leave before he bombed. You know ISIS remember them? No longer a threat Trump done less tha a year.
9823 2018-04-30 01:51:48 You're a special kind of stupid if you think progressing society means going backwards. ALL means of alternative energy need oil to be produced. Not to mention not all climates can sustain alternative energy year round.
9824 2018-04-30 01:51:29 But sooooo many restaurants serve mediocre fries!

9833 2018-04-30 01:49:48 Thank you for the tip @Rschooley. And personally I’ll be very glad when this controversy dies down. Yes even though I’m no fan of Michelle Wolf or flatline low-brow humor, all the complaining and retorting today feels like a bad mixture of stomach-acid and oil slick.
9834 2018-04-30 01:49:28 Exactly. When I lived in Calgary, I had an excellent chat with a politician from the time. I mentioned being put to bed in my snowsuit because my parents were struggling to pay insane oil bills. It appalled him and it humanized the other side.
9835 2018-04-30 01:49:24 Don't get me started, mine is so dry & fried, looking for a good treatment to repair the split ends. Eggs & olive oil, eat it or put it on your hair for an hour then eat it. lol

おめでとうごさいます。
9872 2018-04-30 01:44:32 Good ideas. I do have raw baby carrots as part of my snacks, so extra carrots would be a high starch addition, but tomatoes are great, especially for reducing inflammation. Idk how to cook tomatoes tho. Was also thinking to try brussel sprouts roasted w a bit of salt/pepper/oil
9873 2018-04-30 01:44:26 To be fair, it didn't backfire because of their doing (unless you truly believe the Sask Party caused the global recession, the slump in oil prices, and the slump in potash prices).
9874 2018-04-30 01:44:22 Asha, have you or Sam tried using a TFAL actifry machine. It makes great fries with one teaspoon of oil. Add whatever spices you like and makes crispy delicious fries without the oil also great for wings or stirfry
9875 2018-04-30 01:44:11 which oil is recommended?
9876 2018-04-30 01:44:05 The Athabaskan oil sands can be mined for something like another 200-300 years.

9884 2018-04-30 01:43:16 You say that as though the Sask Party caused the global recession or the slump in potash and oil prices that have dogged our economy.

The Sask Party is weathering a recession, not causing it.

If I knew in advance, I would have brought a 3oz olive oil. :) #1stworldproblems Should I buy some olive oil for my next #Mint? :)
9902 2018-04-30 01:41:28 If you look at the recent findings in Bahrain and in other places in last few years - I doubt about peak oil. Plus you have Venezuela - if the country gets stable - have massive resources in oil.

9918 2018-04-30 01:39:13 As mentioned, ~80% of oil demand in the U.S. is from transportation.
Industry decisions are almost immaterial, unless they start constructing more corporate railroads or invent anti-grav drones.

9926 2018-04-30 01:38:19 Here is a fair question, knowing the Koch’s have the largest oil sands leases and knowing they have the refining capacity for bitumen in the US, how is it in their interest to have TMX go through? Total speculation, but are they funding anti TMX protests.
9927 2018-04-30 01:38:10 I would use some olive oil with the seasoning to make a paste and put it under the skin as well to better season the meat! but it came out very moist! I used the juices to make a gravy!

9929 2018-04-30 01:37:04 I just used Salt, Pepper, Garlic, Onion Powder, and Paprika. Seared both sides for 4 minutes each with olive oil.

9930 2018-04-30 01:36:43 Idk housing and construction have more attention. #cpi both industry and services are the challenge to become less and less dependent on oil and serve also positive their own energy transition, including the 100 fuel due to road quality and distances

2. Fresh Aloe Vera leaf : Add this step to your deep conditioning or do it before you cleanse
9976 2018-04-30 01:27:39 I saw this before  I would be afraid that a major grease fire would happen cause the pans are so thin. Could you imagine picking that up and the oil spill and burn you all over? 
9977 2018-04-30 01:27:22 I had a dream that @h3h3productions moved in next door to us and kept interfering with our filming outside by running up to me and spraying me in the face with "organic baking oil spray."

9982 2018-04-30 01:25:00 Sounds real easy... if African nations stop selling the natural resources for pennies. Sweden licenses its natural gas/oil resources for damn good money. These African nations are getting raped
