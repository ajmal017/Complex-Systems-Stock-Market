0 2018-07-18 23:59:57 I get home late tonight so I will be burning the midnight oil this week watching #Suits but very soon I'm going to review it for @SpoilerTV and I want you to tell me all your favorite parts!!!!!!
1 2018-07-18 23:59:44 I want a fully body deep tissue hot stone oil flowing  massage without the person touching me part. #FibroLife
2 2018-07-18 23:59:40 I put some coconut oil into an old setting spray bottle so it would be easier to apply and Andrea still thought it was setting spray in there .. she just double sprayed her face with coconut oil 
3 2018-07-18 23:59:28 You're correct that the refugee system needs better planning and supports. But to suggest we shouldn't accept refugees because settlement is difficult is like saying we shouldn't have Albertans because oil is cyclical.
4 2018-07-18 23:59:23 That it no one that supports fossil fuels is a brother. Mental illness is believing in pipelines and oil. I don’t need much just far distance from monitors of North America . Denounce citizenship with joy.
5 2018-07-18 23:59:12 My biggest gripe with both it and beyond burger is how much coconut oil they use, which defeats a lot of the health benefits of the plant-based patty. 

Still prefer a good black bean patty over either
6 2018-07-18 23:59:10 Pulled the first Cherokee Purple off the vine tonight. As we were all standing around the island enjoying it, the 6-year-old says, “Daddy, this would be really good with the _good_ olive oil.” I nearly shed a tear.
7 2018-07-18 23:59:02 Baby soap with just a little bit of baby oil is the actual winner
8 2018-07-18 23:59:01 Warm some oil and put it in your ear with some Tampon
9 2018-07-18 23:58:59 I was unbelievably desperate to get some type of tan on my pale face and when I literally bathed myself in tanning oil today I had NO IDEA IT WOULD END LIKE THIS I LOOK LIKE DAVID HASSELHOFF
10 2018-07-18 23:58:56 Yeah cause hypotheticals are the answers! Just stop hating cause he aired out truths about people on that staff. First year 7-6 whoopy,now crowned them year two. Moral victory I with snake oil salesman coach.

12 2018-07-18 23:58:35 Germany has neither stomach nor means to comit to traditional warfare. They are taking over by stealth, the pen is mightier than the sword. Russia allegedly traded oil with Turkey who allegedly traded with ISIS, common knowledge. Yes Germany is powered by ISIS
13 2018-07-18 23:58:23 I hate to give up Tide,  oil of Olay and dawn dish soap but I JUST did and will continue to BOYCOTT all products noted. It’s time for advertisers to stop feeding FOX propaganda machine.
14 2018-07-18 23:58:22 Just realize I gotta change my oil
15 2018-07-18 23:58:17 #Trump is showing diplomacy. Any European nation that buys oil & natural gas from #Russia instead of AMERICA is bad news.  Obama's Iran Deal helped Russia, dismantling Europes missile defense systems in 2008/09 helped Russia, URANIUM & ONE deal helped RUSSIA.
16 2018-07-18 23:58:13 I believe the sharpie might've  streaked because it was oil based, but you shouldn't have that problem with acrylic paint. As long as its fully dry.. I believe there's also spray on sealer, used for wood furniture, If you wanna avoid any extra friction. :3
17 2018-07-18 23:58:04 We have some of the most strict environmental laws in the world, produce the cleanest power (from oil) and the most controlled oil production also.

37 2018-07-18 23:57:39 Kids today with their fortnite and olive oil.
38 2018-07-18 23:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
39 2018-07-18 23:57:13 like the essential oil massage i just did. im a bit skeptical on whether it is working or if it is the placebo effect working. or would there be a placebo if I am wondering if there is a placebo??? huh????
40 2018-07-18 23:57:09 Be a man? really? He's done what every former president in my recent memory has done by meeting with the Russian leader. He has placed a lot of sanctions on them and kicked russian nationals out of our country. He's put pressure on their oil exports. You're an idiot.
41 2018-07-18 23:57:08 Profiting off of Iraqi oil probably.
42 2018-07-18 23:56:56 More work to do this week on Jeep. Head seals and new serpentine belt and oil change
43 2018-07-18 23:56:54 My gma needs to get her priorities straight..I didn’t mind paying for her new tire and oil change but don’t cry to me about how broke you are and how you need me to buy groceries because you bought a Kate spade purse you didn’t need
44 2018-07-18 23:56:43 I just diced up some fresh dragon cayans, crushed some black pepper, and mixed some garlic all together in an oil and water base. I'm gonna let it sit in the sun all day tomorrow, then spray perimeter of my garden. Think this will work?
45 2018-07-18 23:56:40 33But a certain Sa·marʹi·tan traveling the road came upon him, and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.34So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.3

"I've been hurt enough!"

She was close to breaking down. Tears still flowing.

"...Im sick of it.."
48 2018-07-18 23:55:39 You have got to be kidding. Your liberal ideology is responsible for so much more death. I cannot believe you think your tears are going to come off as genuine when you killed hundreds of thousands of people for oil and bananas.
49 2018-07-18 23:55:36 生理んときなんか立ってるだけでも辛いときあるのに、こういうのってもうあがっちゃったババア教師か生理も出産も病気じゃないってのたまうジジイ教師の発想なのかしら？　＞RT
50 2018-07-18 23:55:30 OPEC. You mean the ones that control production levels coming from the largest oil producers in MidEast, which directly affects pricing worldwide via that pesky supply/demand thingy?  It’s their purpose and always has been.
51 2018-07-18 23:55:25 So, 35 dollars for an oil change isn't expensive when you compare it to a Bugatti. An oil change for a Bugatti is 21,000 dollars.

Salt/pepper 
Mix and fridge 

55 2018-07-18 23:54:25 They knew that going in because they are too.  Please don't expect them to get a conscious now.  From here on anything that comes out of their mouth is to get them russia.  To give USA to russia.  It's that simple. $$$ oil and human trafficking.
56 2018-07-18 23:54:20 You mean how Trump is pressuring Germany over their Russian gas and oil imports?

59 2018-07-18 23:53:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
60 2018-07-18 23:53:53 I got you next time. Mazola or Olive oil?

68 2018-07-18 23:53:07 Or what kind of oil you should put in your motorcycle.
69 2018-07-18 23:52:57 I was working way up north in Canada's oil patch and I happen to park my company truck next to a Halliburton truck. 
To be fair it was a hybrid it could run on gas or pure evil.
They have their tentacles everywhere.
70 2018-07-18 23:52:43 The carbon tax is a tax on the stupid
We have 37 M people
0.5% of the world's pop
Every Canadian could literal burn barrels of oil and it would make no difference

72 2018-07-18 23:52:13 Hmmm I think they’re pretty cheap here. Will check for you at some point (assuming cheap here = cheaper in the land of oil and horning)
73 2018-07-18 23:52:09 Greatest trick he did was to piss off the Kock brothers and big oil.
74 2018-07-18 23:51:59 Me estoy dando una merecida terapia facial con coconut oil (aceite de coco en inglés) y la estoy disfrutando demasiado.
75 2018-07-18 23:51:54 But is it virgin olive oil?
76 2018-07-18 23:51:46 I have practically doused myself in CBD oil and took Excedrin and my headache stillll won’t go away.

78 2018-07-18 23:51:04 The #Yorubas are complicit in the deaths in #Nigeria! For love of Oil inducements & the Lagos Port monopoly they turned their backs to the cry of other ethnic nations currently trapped in Fulani Nigeria's Jihad.
79 2018-07-18 23:50:43 Liberal conservative and one big oil pipeline bunch of fools. Include NDP Alberta
80 2018-07-18 23:50:26 Im sure an oil pipeline has something to do with it. That's what Putin wanted with Syria.
81 2018-07-18 23:50:24 @RealLifeLore1 Hello, I have a suggestions for a video: how many tankers oil spills would be needed to utterly destroy marine life on Earth.
Hope it's helpful!
82 2018-07-18 23:50:10 Currently on 2001 followers so thanks again newbies, a new milestone.2001 was a good year.I was building oil rigs by then (I had some help) but the music scene was in decline. It's one of those periods for me that I can't remember much so must have been good 
83 2018-07-18 23:49:54 Has anyone tried oil pulling ? Do you think it works or is it a waste?

88 2018-07-18 23:49:25 What if the whole DevOps movement is off track? What if we only needed to 1) figure out CD 2) figure out how to apply that CD in our stacks? Is all that other stuff snake oil?

92 2018-07-18 23:48:50 also notice he courted china, n&s korea before meeting russia.  possibly an effort to weaken russia's position before meeting?  And we we not just informed the other day how he was critical of germany for russian oil imports?
93 2018-07-18 23:48:36 ❝Response. Your talent may not have come in handy, but your natural charisma would have. You have a strange way of putting people at ease, even by being the butt of jokes. . . So you shouldn’t feel sorry for yourself! I’m sure of it. . . I’m sure you helped out a bunch!❞
94 2018-07-18 23:48:19 More importantly we now have digitally networked platform(aka cloud) “to capture and analyze” it to generate value that can be derived using #analytics,#AI #MachineLearning , as they say data is the new oil, remember though the value is derived by those who got “refineries”.
95 2018-07-18 23:48:17 Those three are the top producers I the world. Over one million BPD is actually alooooot, as compared to other countries producing way less. We are oil 'rich' though our citizens aren't rich.

100 2018-07-18 23:47:49 AJ, Nigeria is huge oil exporter yet still has an absolute poverty level of 61%! One of the problems with UN involvement as well as NGO'S is they do nothing to create capital & wealth or help countries with entrepreneurial development. Until this happens, progress is unlikely.
101 2018-07-18 23:47:45 I believe we need an Energy East project  as well.   Get our steel companies back to work and eliminate the need for foreign oil.   This needs to be done while the US has its steel tariffs in place.
102 2018-07-18 23:47:17 Yea, oil always been texas back bone..that’s why dont dont give af about anything else. Them niggas guapin over there in Jerry’s world

106 2018-07-18 23:46:55 I think a requirement to be a mechanic or work for a place that changes your oil is to be able to talk flawlessly with a cig in your mouth. They’re so good at it
107 2018-07-18 23:46:41 Not a good feeling when you get car oil blasted all over your face.. 
108 2018-07-18 23:46:40 Trump is not giving Russia anything. Wants Germany to buy oil/gas from USA. Russia is really hurting.POTUS sanctions very hard on Russia. If HRC’s emails weren’t on Weiner’s laptop (classified & illegal), the NYPD wouldn’t have pushed Comey to make the announcement.

124 2018-07-18 23:44:19 The facts support him; weapon sales to Ukraine & Georgia, expansion of US oil & gas production & exports, increased NATO presence in Baltics, sanctions on Russia, killing Russian mercs in Syria, forcing NATO members to address defense spending etc.

145 2018-07-18 23:40:27 Trump knows Pooty isn't changing nor will Russia. #Trump is using diplomacy & hopefully Europe will buy oil and natural gas from America instead of Russia. Trump will figure out who's friend or foe rather quickly.

148 2018-07-18 23:40:12 Sorry to hear about that I know how they feel being employed in the Western Oil patch! That no one else in Canada wishes to support! I’ve seen a lot of pain here in the west due to Trudeau’s dismissal of western concerns!

164 2018-07-18 23:38:10 @GasBuddyDan I guess the Catch22 would be assuming the President's concern about rapid drawdowns is correct and possible oil shortage, there won't be any need to store additional capacity because the conventional U.S. storage PADDS will not be full as there won't be enough oil

167 2018-07-18 23:37:57 He is a damn Marxist.  Renounced his American citizenship, went to Russia gamed the oil industry.  Hates Putin because he is not a Marxist.  The publicly available information on this clown is shady AF.
168 2018-07-18 23:37:55 So my mom drovemy car down the road and my oil light came on which is normal and she thought she was going to blow it up so she took it back home so moral of the story is she fuck my seat up
169 2018-07-18 23:37:36 Nope! They have it in oil form!
170 2018-07-18 23:37:08 Oil demand is growing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Obstructing Gay friendly Oil = killing #LGBTQ Please tell @uvicpride @VictoriaPride why you don’t protest #bloodoil
171 2018-07-18 23:37:02 son idk what’s wrong with my car but, i knew i shoulda went got my own oil changed 
172 2018-07-18 23:36:52 All I want in this life of sin is to plant trees, feed bees, build solar panels, and convert gas engines to vegetable oil. Is that too much to ask?!
173 2018-07-18 23:36:42 Fuck no, I line up oil & gas pipeline to send out. I’m outside all damn day lol
174 2018-07-18 23:36:35 Crashing auto piloted planes to your own towers then killings and raping millions of Iraqi people for the sake of oil seems more crooked to me tho. But we are crooked cause we help those people you keep making homeless ? Nice brain you got there dude
175 2018-07-18 23:36:22 My head was incredibly mushy most of the day. A friend suggested I try out an essential oil roller she has for Focus. Say what you will about EOs, but it sure worked! I've already almost hit my word count goal for the day in the hour since I used it. #amwriting #writerslife
176 2018-07-18 23:36:11 Adulting is hard because I have to like, do stuff. Ex. I was supposed to get an oil change about 5,000 miles ago. But because adulting is hard, I haven’t gotten around to it yet
177 2018-07-18 23:36:07 Hemp makes incredibly good Oriented Strand Board (like plywood). The big timber companies like Georgia Pacific and Weyerhaeuser don’t want farmers to be able to compete with their wood products, so they work hard to keep hemp growing illegal. Oil companies fight it, too.

179 2018-07-18 23:35:57 oh. my first guess is that it needed more oil or an oil change.
180 2018-07-18 23:35:54 Trump did not make a deal with Russia. He actually told Putin the US will be competing directly with Russia on oil and gas.
181 2018-07-18 23:35:48 And let's remember all even after Obama administration tried to quelch it thru not approving oil drilling permits & shuttering oil wells. Way to go Texas!!
182 2018-07-18 23:35:44 It's not about cuisine: if ONU and WHO talk about olive oil to be "as dangerous as smoking", while LAST YEAR Bloomberg stated that Italians' health is the best THANKS to olive oil... there's something just not working.
I've never seen anybody dead 'cause of olive oil, anyway 
183 2018-07-18 23:35:44 I actually might cry! I can no longer eat Any of my favorite foods. I'm going to have to live off of  Cauliflower and kale and mushrooms. I cant eat tomatoes or any out of season fruit or anything with gluten or tree nuts or peanuts. No vegetable oil or sunflower seed oil.

197 2018-07-18 23:34:06 Wonder if there's oil in them thar hills!
198 2018-07-18 23:34:04 Yup, Kara Sea off shore oil fields then ran out of drilling materials and ground to a halt.
Those were Obama’s sanctions.
Trump is full of crap on his “I’ve been tough on Russia “ line.
199 2018-07-18 23:33:52 I used to wax my hair when it was short.  I loved the control it gave.  It’s long now and I just use hairdresser oil and curl creme on the days I shampoo.

204 2018-07-18 23:33:17 Carnitas from a bone-in pork shoulder can be easily made in a slow cooker. The bean salad requires dicing onions & having beans plus olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Sauté the onions in a large volume of olive oil then simmer the beans with the vinegar. Even better the next day.

214 2018-07-18 23:31:56 Anyone have recommendations on air fryer vs using a convection toaster oven?

Is the tech nearly the same once u toss the food in a little oil & cooked in a convection oven?

228 2018-07-18 23:30:00 I suspect most peddlers of outrageous ideas are doing the same thing. Rational discourse dragged us out of the dark ages of superstition. But it also salted the ground for the snake oil salesmen. To get back their markets they first have to destroy rationality.

258 2018-07-18 23:25:48 “If it were a country, Texas would be the world's No. 3 oil producer, behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia...” The US is the #3 oil producer so TX must produce a bit over half of total US production to surpass Iraq (#4), I guess it then surpasses the remaining US output to be #3?

271 2018-07-18 23:24:10 Don’t dismiss the gas and oil. I learned right after the election of dozens of dirty players of various nationalities, including some Americans, who are enmeshed in a large interconnected scheme to enrich themselves. Will they be exposed? Not if Putin has his way!

276 2018-07-18 23:23:32 Exactly! It works great for benzodiazepine withdrawals though. Withdrawals can be awful for people who have been on them long term, or for people who abuse them. The CBD oil I get is a 10:1 ratio of Cannibis to THC. I can’t take it very often, otherwise it creates anxiety.

285 2018-07-18 23:22:26 I bought an oil diffuser and looked up dog,  cat and rabbit safe oils so I’m well on my way of becoming a crunchy mom.

302 2018-07-18 23:20:41 Americans would also like to thank you for your oil companies moving here as excessive regulations are making it increasingly impossible for them to make a profit in Canada. The jobs are nice but what will be nicer still is no longer relying on importing Canadian oil
303 2018-07-18 23:20:21 The turbo diesel can have a lot of mechanical issues, so make sure you budget for more frequent oil changes if you don’t want your engine to start smoking (I appraise cars for a living, so I see a lot of them that have been not maintained)

308 2018-07-18 23:19:40 Despite that Oil companies have no interest in lowering fuel prices due to Government policies with respect to taxes makes it even worse for companies to lower the prices in an economy Government should intervene and subsidies and enforce favourable taxes that will be better

346 2018-07-18 23:12:50 The lower prices of the suppliers doesn't matter to the consumer then. Oil companies have no interest in lowering the cost of petrol. Perhaps gov should import fuel.

425 2018-07-18 23:03:19 Can we please cut fuel duty too whilst we’re at it, it’s astronomical!  We blame the hike in oil per barrel, but never the amount of duty we pay!  Just sayin’

430 2018-07-18 23:02:06 There's a misconception that we're an oil rich country, oil revenue per person per annum in Nigeria in 2013 when crud oil prices were US$100 per barrel was 520$, in Qatar and Kuwait it was $31,000 and 27,000 per person annually.. There isn't much someone can do with 187k annually
431 2018-07-18 23:02:04 Now OPEC did play a part in the inflation of the 70s and 80s due to the oil embargo in retaliation for the US aiding Israel in the Yom Kippur war of 1973. The 2008 recession was caused by hyperventilating into financial and real estate bubble that was already stretched too thin

444 2018-07-18 23:00:24 Several Tax Revenue streams associated with Oil:

Extraction&Production:  Benefits mostly Source Location/Country

Processing: Benefits mostly place done

Consumption: Benefits where final Sale happens

449 2018-07-18 22:59:54 But governments are doing that all the time all over the world. They don't like upsetting a nation they have to trade with or have oil or are supporting militarily. Israel for one, Suadi Arabia another. Both these nations are committing atrocities but nothing said.

452 2018-07-18 22:59:21 One gram of fat contains 9 calories per gram, oil is basically 98% fat and butter is like 60-70% depending on which type. Protein and carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram. This means that you can eat more than twice as much carbs/protein as you can fat. Thus oil/butter bad.

Why Germany buying oil from Russia if they feel threatened?
That US should not be the only country paying the NATO dues.
That we all should raise to 4%

472 2018-07-18 22:57:36 Carter inherited the oil embargo, and the bad economy. He didn’t create it. Reagan ran up the debt of the U.S. more than ALL previous Pres combined. And actually Carter did rescue many of the hostages in his term but not all of them. Reagan was no God sorry to say.

559 2018-07-18 22:46:54 As for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sale

561 2018-07-18 22:46:45 @Ladybug_Vic loves oil and vinegar with her bread.

563 2018-07-18 22:46:06 did she put cooking oil on her face :(
564 2018-07-18 22:46:04 In 2009, the sharp fall in Real GDP (negative economic growth) was caused by:
Higher oil prices reducing living standards
Global credit crunch leading to a fall in bank lending and investment
Fall in house prices causing lower wealth and spending
Where are we today?
565 2018-07-18 22:46:02 Italian....Oil and Vin really the move tho

571 2018-07-18 22:45:28 PSA to all ladies and gents who “think” they’ll only burn in the sun! 
1.coconut oil is a sunscreen and tanning oil in one!
2.witch hazel is great for after the sun
3.jojoba oil after the sun is also great especially if u got a little wee burnt!

577 2018-07-18 22:44:46 LISTENNNN kourt...sometimes they make the chicken too oily to where I feel like I dunked my lips in oil after a bite
578 2018-07-18 22:44:45 In case you haven't connected the news dots... Putin controls the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 500 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Obama put sanctions in place which stopped that deal. Russia then hacked into our government in order to get Trump in
579 2018-07-18 22:44:09 Not! F150 all day long. You call yourself an American? No matter where it is made, itis still a Toyota. Trucks are Ford, Dodge or Chevy PERIOD end of sentence.

583 2018-07-18 22:43:14 Trump is on the side of the drug companies, of the oligarchs.  All the Republicans are, all sold out to big industry. (Big oil most bigley) And all the industries have different demands, so they're all over the map and confusing the people.  This has to stop.
584 2018-07-18 22:43:11 So I'm just now realizing, Trump went to Brussels and said the Germans were owned by Russia because of the quantities of oil they buy from them. A day or so later he goes on global TV with Putin and says he trusts Putin over US intel. He won't say he misspoke with Germany tho.
585 2018-07-18 22:42:55 One of my brothers works in the oil industry on smaller "stripper wells". Those wells can go months or years without him touching them.  Does a well stop creating value when he's finished working on it and drives away?
586 2018-07-18 22:42:51 still need to show more protest to dirty oil transportation
587 2018-07-18 22:42:37 I publicly condemned the separation of families at the border, but then voted to support ICE; I publicly opposed big oil, but then accepted thousands of contribution $$ from them; I publicly supported illegal sanctuary policies, but then voted against DACA #CA24 #CheatersWin
588 2018-07-18 22:42:33 Found a twenty minute video of a Bugatti Veyron getting an oil change.   I'm watching the whole damn thing. #summertime #andthelivingseasy
589 2018-07-18 22:42:28 I enjoy long walks to the bodega and turkey, cheese with salt, pepper, oil & vinegar sandwiches eaten on the stoop.
590 2018-07-18 22:42:16 There's NO business case for this pipeline-shown repeatedly & ignored by oil shills. There's no safety plan for the ppl of Bby, which their fire dept has voiced strenuously. There's enough infrastructure in place now to support decades of oil production. The time to evolve is now
591 2018-07-18 22:42:11 The the pot of oil Elisha told the widow to pour into the pot didn't grow. It was still in a container her own mouth said was not enough. Your eyes may tell you God didn't give you enough to win, but keep pouring! He is Jehovah Jireh! He will never fail!
592 2018-07-18 22:41:55 Oil is to water as deplorables are to facts. It's pointless.
593 2018-07-18 22:41:52 My question is regarding the election. I would like to know if you will turn off the oil flowing into B.C from Alberta?  Notley said she would and didn't.
594 2018-07-18 22:41:46 Science is the Republican's boogeyman. Always trying to paint raping the Earth as a bad thing...oil over people right Kevy?
595 2018-07-18 22:41:32 Pro tip, if you spill gas/oil mix for a two stroke motor on your jeans, then spend an hour and a half doing yard work, don't forget and leave the jeans on the floor of your bathroom with the door closed after a shower.

My bathroom reeks of chainsaw fuel :(
596 2018-07-18 22:41:21 Nothing sucks more than red/palm oil splashing on your clothes 
597 2018-07-18 22:41:15 Upwards of 50 means 0 to 50 right? Oil is 50 ♡, others are 30 ♡, others are 0 ♡. Checks out. This might be a "table" vs. "table" thing and some of us interpret upwards at 50+ and other as 50-?
598 2018-07-18 22:40:56 no lie I take Cbd oil
599 2018-07-18 22:40:50 You landed in Texas c. 1852, you know there’s millions of gallons of oil under your feet. You bought the land only to realize you can’t drill yet because the tech doesn’t exist yet to get the oil out. You’re before your time, just wait. Crypto is going to be a economic tsunami

602 2018-07-18 22:40:32 But what do oil companies do ?
603 2018-07-18 22:40:23 To care for a fresh piercing, wash with soap and water or saline solution, twice a day. Alcohol dries the piercing out. If it gets too dry, it cracks and bleeds- wound remains open. I prefer oil-based soaps. They clean the wound, and provide oil to soften up the healing tissue.
604 2018-07-18 22:40:19 The best part of being anti social is that people dont @ you with their essential oil pyramid scheme shit
605 2018-07-18 22:40:17 Can’t burn oil forever. The price of inaction is far higher. Change is scary but necessary.

646 2018-07-18 22:32:51 Tell me, in the last 100 years, when truth, or even a close facsimile there of, mattered one iota to the Democrats or the Republicans for the length of their attention span(microseconds). Politicians and the truth are like oil and water.

676 2018-07-18 22:28:21 Crocs are just so gross to begin with. They are sweat and bacteria magnets and they're made from crude oil byproduct. Buy a pair and support the downstream oil & gas industry. They embody for me much of what is wrong with consumer culture.

683 2018-07-18 22:27:29 I do agree that the price of many things are artificially low because they don't include the cost of fixing the problems they cause, especially oil. If oil costs included the cost of cleanup it'd be prohibitively expensive.
684 2018-07-18 22:27:25 Westminster will try every dirty trick in the book to keep hold of Scotland's resources, which are far more than just oil and gas of course, once out of the EU Tories can end devolution, close Scottish Parliament and sell off everything in Scotland in the interest of crappy deals
685 2018-07-18 22:27:25 Public transit is great if you have it but outside metro centres need to get to work, grow crops, transport food, produce oil etc.  We already pay way more than our fair share in tax.

Place the cooking oil in a pan and apply heat
When the oil is hot enough, put-in the marinated chicken. Cook all the sides for about 5 minutes.
689 2018-07-18 22:27:03 My dad thinks it might be my radiator. It smells like burning plastic or something :( but I figured when I got my oil check they would’ve done all that for me. Mehhhhhhhhh. Imma look later.
690 2018-07-18 22:26:55 Kale is gross. Full stop. No, don't tell me I just don't prepare it right. No, don't tell me how I have to massage it in oil to break up the fibers or whatever. No, don't tell me "oh but it's SO GOOD" for me. So is not eating stuff I hate. Kale can go away forever.
691 2018-07-18 22:26:53 The people who tell a lifelong insomniac to 'try melatonin for sleep' are the same ppl who tell you to try CBD Oil for your manic stages. BUT I'M TRYING BOTH. AGAIN. ASSHOLES.
692 2018-07-18 22:26:46 The Financial Times reported flaring of natural gas in US is rising. You can say so what. Or oil companies did it. Those consumers who care about environmental profile may find neither explanation good enough.
693 2018-07-18 22:26:44 Yes, using an moisturizing product combats oily skin, I use jojoba oil in my face routine or tea tree oil.

698 2018-07-18 22:26:16 I make less money than I did 15 years ago! Employment may be up in some sectors as the ebb and flow us natural and not your accomplishment! Wages are down overall and the “tax” cut is a joke! Reward the rich, screw the poor. Big business, banks, and oil rule!

707 2018-07-18 22:25:00 The carbon tax solves nothing. We are a massive exporter of carbon. Oil and coal. Our use is minimal. The tax avoids the oil and coal exports. We pay for asia's co2. What???

711 2018-07-18 22:24:19 8. Moisturize! Oily skin needs moisturizing and hydration. When your skin loses its moisture, the sebaceous glands produce even more oil. Use an oil-free, non-comedogenic, water-based moisturizer.

729 2018-07-18 22:21:50 Is that $70-75 on your Midland differential or WTI $75 which means West Texas oil sells for $50, lower then WCS in Canada!?
730 2018-07-18 22:21:45 1. Avoid harsh, drying ingredients. They actually make your skin produce even more oil. SD alcohol and denatured alcohol are part of the no list.
731 2018-07-18 22:21:42 Take a few of those, cut in half. Put  little olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Place in skillet adding a pinch of salt. Allow to soften, add some basil chiffonade. Turn out onto plate beside some scrambled eggs. Heaven.

734 2018-07-18 22:21:31 I simply state that CO2 amongst other things has massive effects on our habitat. Your statement that gas or oil is natural is ludicrous- I’m not after ‘most natural’ but ‘least harmful’ for our environment that we depend on for survival.

740 2018-07-18 22:20:48 I think emus - like chickens and turkeys - are farmed for their meat. The oil comes from their fat. (I thought maybe it was their preening oil but I just looked it up now and it doesn’t look like that’s the case...)

743 2018-07-18 22:20:47 Well, I can speculate.  We import commodities from Russia (oil, minerals, gems, etc.), which they have a lot of.  We export highly value-added goods like aircraft, machinery, vehicles, etc., but they're still a relatively poor country so very limited market.
744 2018-07-18 22:20:46 But why this beans oil just plenty like this ni?

825 2018-07-18 22:10:38 Leviticus 23:13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin. #HolySpirit
826 2018-07-18 22:10:31 i wonder how humans discovered that throwing food into a vat of super heated oil made things delicious
827 2018-07-18 22:10:30 I guess the problem is that Zuck confusee freedom of speech with free access to a massive unconttolled distribution. Not every free speech deserves free access to distribution. Not every fire needs oil.
828 2018-07-18 22:10:28 …ぐぅ
829 2018-07-18 22:10:17 Blame that on the crude oil  prices. Stop being a tart.
830 2018-07-18 22:10:09 When you’ve been feeling shitty all day and nothing seems to be helping you feel less shitty, I either recommend sitting in your car and crying or taking a bubble bath. If those fail, use witchcraft. Or fairy magic. Or lavender essential oil. All the same thing.
831 2018-07-18 22:10:08 It should better be ooo
832 2018-07-18 22:10:07 隣の人鼻がピーピーうっせえ

834 2018-07-18 22:10:06 It's a typing error mate
Nobody is above mistake 
will tak note next time
835 2018-07-18 22:10:01 nice 
836 2018-07-18 22:09:55 Try tea tree oil, it works really well for me!
837 2018-07-18 22:09:49 I use one from DermaDoctor. I apply it every single day, night and day time. It makes my skin so smooth and nice. It’s $95.00 but there are plenty other ones. There’s rosehip oil you can get that’s similar and way more affordable. Make sure it’s organic!
838 2018-07-18 22:09:47 I think you're right. I never comment on Trumps because there are too many crazies on his mentions
839 2018-07-18 22:09:34 Maybe you need tea tree oil.
840 2018-07-18 22:09:27 Just don’t buy the ones with vegetable oil in them! My husband was so mad he’d been doing that for years thinking it was healthy... 
841 2018-07-18 22:09:14 Well I think the USD/Pound/Yen are all artificial BS created out of thin air. I don’t give credibility to the fiat currency system.

However value is a real. Gold, silver, oil, etc does have real value.

The value of human life is not based on your net worth...
842 2018-07-18 22:09:01 I get your point.  My definition of Neo Con is war monger, military industrial complex types.  Like invading a country under the guise of WMD’s when in reality it’s about oil.
843 2018-07-18 22:08:49 CBD oil is great to help with any pain and nausea while going trough treatment and it won’t get them high like normal cannabis would because there isn’t any THC in it. Definitely helped my aunt when she was going through treatment
844 2018-07-18 22:08:46 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
845 2018-07-18 22:08:43 Big corporations, oil companies, factories, etc. yes but we have to start somewhere
846 2018-07-18 22:08:39 Fedora is a Mississippi snake oil salesmen. Like Mack Brown was. They’ll say anything to get on TV
847 2018-07-18 22:08:36 lavender essential oil really grounds me
848 2018-07-18 22:08:33 I'm going to eat a cheeseburger with a fucking egg on it for dinner. Not sure about the fish part. Maybe I'll just take a fish oil pill.
849 2018-07-18 22:08:33 Our Native American voices, and stop exports of liquefied natural gas and crude oil.
850 2018-07-18 22:08:30 I feel so grown taking my car to get oil change and all that stuff
851 2018-07-18 22:08:14 Oil pulling is a solid 0/10 from me, dawg
852 2018-07-18 22:08:07 ILLEGAL should get you NADA, ZIP, ZILCH, ZERO!!
853 2018-07-18 22:08:06 #AugustMag2018 #BudgetUG What this will do is it could at least decrease our dependence on foreign oil and begin to direct attention to other cash strapped parts of the Economy.
854 2018-07-18 22:07:53 Is it too much to ask for to have separate bottles of shampoo and conditioner?
Why does every men's hygiene product have to be like "9 in 1 shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, shaving cream, aloe vera, baking soda, motor oil, and dry wall compound... in Ocean Charge"
855 2018-07-18 22:07:47 Today I learned that canola is made from Rapeseed. Gee I wonder why they didn’t try to sell margarine as made from healthy rapeseed oil.
856 2018-07-18 22:07:33 Chad, just to be clear, it is possible to be a socialistic government and have a capitalist economy. Ask your local Norwegian oil baron billionaire. The US is already half-socialist for over 100 years.
857 2018-07-18 22:07:31 Trump sell oil to Russia as he tells Germany to stop depending on Russian oil/gas?  Remember hillary is the one who sold Uranium to Russia for a $400M campaign contribution.  Do you even follow politics?
858 2018-07-18 22:07:30 The key to all of this is the argument between ILLEGAL (meaning having NO RIGHTS to anything) vs LEGAL (meaning having rights)—why is this such a hard point for ANYONE to understand. It’s black and white, no gray areas in this argument..
859 2018-07-18 22:07:21 Is there any oil left to be extracted?
860 2018-07-18 22:07:16 Cake ne yasir
861 2018-07-18 22:07:06 Took  Alexis car to Ford for an oil change and seen this Shelby GT350, I want one so bad.
862 2018-07-18 22:07:05 PUT OIL ON THE SCALP LIKE YOU DO WITH THE AFRICAN BRAIDS
863 2018-07-18 22:07:03 Oh this tiring, oversimplifying 'big oil fueled gullible right-wingers vs. genuine smart left-wingers'-narrative.

I'm a climate skeptic (cuz I don't feed on junkscience) AND I support phasing out fossil fuels (just not head over heels) AND demand radical wealth redistribution.
864 2018-07-18 22:07:01 @Lucas_Oil sponsors alot of racing!! 
Whatcha think @Lucas_Oil??? Can you help him out?
#itworks
865 2018-07-18 22:06:56 I call his office, send tweets, and email. @LindseyGrahamSC is still sitting on his hands and is all talk.
866 2018-07-18 22:06:32 And we can probably thank Murphy Oil for this
867 2018-07-18 22:06:29 So women "have no brains by trying to get someone else to pay for birth control"? What about all the Uber Rich oil companies who need tax payer money to cover research? 
Sorry for just trying to wrap my mind around that logic, no luck so far.
868 2018-07-18 22:06:25 I has stuff to eat and mum uses her hair coconut oil spray on me paws too. Says if it’s good enough for her, it’ll be good for me.  Dad thinks she’s mad
869 2018-07-18 22:06:19 some places do have a flat rate for an oil change but if your car is a pain in the ass they will charge you more
870 2018-07-18 22:06:18 Politics and law enforcement are oil and water...
871 2018-07-18 22:06:12 We have several work trucks. Toyota tends to rust, harder to fix. 
Ford is over all a better work truck; our choice for durability, cheaper to fix and better off road. To be fair, we are very hard on trucks, and duallys are usually what we use.
872 2018-07-18 22:06:11 I’ve ran out of moisturiser recently so been using this big bottle of bio oil I have and forgot how good it is, My skins so soft but looks so dewy 
873 2018-07-18 22:06:10 He also wants oil lamps, the Telegraph, and paper checks. He’s out of touch with 21st Century and global economy. Resign or step aside @BradSherman.
874 2018-07-18 22:06:06 So interesting day today: since I developed my peanut allergy I've stayed away from all nuts & nut based sauces (IE Peanut butter, oil, etc) as I wasn't sure if all nuts would get me sick. Tried cashew butter today; it's pretty good, now just need to see if I don't get sick
875 2018-07-18 22:06:05 I'm struggling to convince my friends in the >70age group that Scotland is rich enough to 'cope' with independence. They say - why is our elec so dear if we produce so much of it? Oil is in the past. We don't make anything. Who can you believe?They're all as bad as each other...

881 2018-07-18 22:05:45 It was chipotle flavored and cooked w coconut oil. Wasn't terrible. I'm just not a fan of the texture. Cc: @didi
882 2018-07-18 22:05:27 Dropped some tea tree oil in the shower. Let it steam up and Inhaled exhaled for awhile. Nice.
883 2018-07-18 22:05:18 This why it is very SAD. Nigeria has expired. Amalgated for British oil and gas control 1914 to 2014. REFERENDUM SOLVES THIS PROBLEM. The GLOBALIST are silent so the British govt And their jihadists can steal oil and gas while committing GENOCIDE.
884 2018-07-18 22:05:09 The alternative is to be like the brain trust at the ECB that hiked rates in mid-2008 because oil prices were in a blow-off phase.
885 2018-07-18 22:05:09 Working hard to get a Drupal Commerce, EPOS integrated site able to sell CBD Oil Products throughout EU, live.  Taken bloody ages and one stalled payment method build to get to a legal working solution #Drupal #CBD #cbdoil
886 2018-07-18 22:05:05 Chevy car dealership so nice they giving out pop corn & drinks while I wait for my oil change lol
887 2018-07-18 22:05:02 Benson ran for Governor on a platform of defunding CU and selling shares to big corporations like his oil company. The huge spikes in in-state tuition, coupled with the, uh, fund-raising, all but accomplished the same goal. I’m sure he is a nice guy but not the point. Sorry.
888 2018-07-18 22:04:41 Also, how about the Body Shop tea tree face wash for future use? Or Bulldog's oil control face wash? I use both of those. Or must it be soap?
889 2018-07-18 22:04:36 It’s revenue neutral and we can’t burn oil forever. Time for change. The cost of inaction is far greater
890 2018-07-18 22:04:30 تصبح على ألف خير..ويبارك فى عمرك
891 2018-07-18 22:04:21 I woke up at 7:30 AM to take my bestie to work 40 minutes away, took my mom some food, went to work myself, got my oil changed AND I have dinner plans tonight .... WHAT A DAY
892 2018-07-18 22:04:14 Remember when #BP dumped tons of Corexit in to the Gulf to make the huge oil spill they caused sit below the oceans surface (EPA don’t see it as a problem below surface) n created the Blue Plague over thousands of square miles of land in the south east US? #PromotedFeed
893 2018-07-18 22:04:10 Eating less meat is an enabler, like riding a bike, because if we got serious about climate change, and finally decided to stop letting oil companies dictate to us, we would all have to drive less, and without tractors, farmers would not be able to export so much feed stock.
894 2018-07-18 22:04:05 That is the thing the pipelines are designed to get to the seaboards so that the gas can be exported.. The whole system is changing from when the oil crude deals were settled on delivery to Cushing..
895 2018-07-18 22:03:57 Takings law my friend. There is a net lien on revenues. PREPA should have no problem being an operation that can service its debt with a minimal increase in costs, while also attracting capital to reform its energy input away from oil. PREPA RSA should have been ok'd.
896 2018-07-18 22:03:54 You too? It’s been rough lately. I need to order that oil. Keep forgetting.
897 2018-07-18 22:03:23 Extra virgin olive oil?   Sorry. Lol
898 2018-07-18 22:03:11 Ps - I love the Haleigh’s Hope brand. I have also heard good things about Charlotte’s Web. Go to the HH brand website and you can read about all the great things their oil can do.
899 2018-07-18 22:03:10 On which note, the UKIPper I used to argue with prior to the referendum, always used to say how much better things were in the 60s and 70s. He was born in the 80s of course; never lived in a world where olive oil was hard to source.
900 2018-07-18 22:03:08 I agree, did you comment on her mentions?
901 2018-07-18 22:03:04 I’ve been waiting for an oil change for my car for literally 2 hours 
902 2018-07-18 22:02:55 My skin flaking up under my beard I think I’m having an allergic reaction to this oil I put in it
903 2018-07-18 22:02:53 Am fed up of coming out of work smelling like grease n oil can someone find me a job not in food pls
904 2018-07-18 22:02:39 Yasss girl. Our hair makes the oil for a reason 
905 2018-07-18 22:02:32 this island is rainy and grim, you can't get decent olive oil or wine for love or money, the locals don't want us here, and did i MENTION there's no decent wine?? fuck this
906 2018-07-18 22:02:28 My stepdad’s cancer was far too advanced for the CBD oil to help the prevention of his cancer from spreading, but I can say it helped with his pain and anxiety before and after chemo. Good luck to your grandma and your family through this tough time. 
907 2018-07-18 22:02:26 Well, today has truly sucked. However, I’ve just made myself a really gorgeous aromatherapy body oil with gold sparkles in it. Sniff me.
908 2018-07-18 22:02:25 So that’s where extra virgin olive oil comes from, I thought it was Waitrose!!!

915 2018-07-18 22:01:46 So negotiating with Iran by Obama, bad, groveling at the feet of Putin, good.... Okay... Not withstanding that getting out of the Iran deal increases oil prices... Which is good for GOP=Kock Bros, and Russian based economy... 
Oh and you're a dirty little coach...smh
916 2018-07-18 22:01:45 For future Twitter reference, and based too much experience (looking at you Rufus), I have discovered that hunters scent removing shampoo removes skunk smell. And the detergent works great on fabrics if your idiot dog rubs the oil onto stuff...

Get it at Cabelas or Bass Pro.
917 2018-07-18 22:01:39 I do that for no particular reason in the summer... brittle toenails from all the dusty dry stuff - mum feeds me coconut oil with me tea and that helps.
918 2018-07-18 22:01:32 So Barack Obama, the man who helped bring slavery back to Africa and destroyed it's most prosperous country to take it's oil has written a "tribute" to Nelson Mandela. How rich. #NelsonMandela #NelsonMandela100 #NelsonMandelaDay

They pay in gold coins and Oil.
933 2018-07-18 22:00:03 The source of the oil is ultimately the source of the revenue. But currently UK keeps the revenue, whether from duty, vat or company taxes even though the oil is Scotland’s. That’s why they are so determined to keep the union.

942 2018-07-18 21:58:17 The truth is if we don't work together radical Islam could take over oil producing regions if not with larger armies then by other means far worse.

949 2018-07-18 21:56:46 NS, NB, PEI were never have provinces. With Oil, NFLD is becoming a have province. I was referring more to BC, Alberta and now Saskatchewan who are now have provinces, who seem to be reluctant to help with transfer payments to the have not provinces.

China is my concern.

And despair is right around the corner-
960 2018-07-18 21:55:32 shouldn’t have stopped by my wife’s work to hit the oil pen
961 2018-07-18 21:55:24 Man, got to change oil. Got to change tires
962 2018-07-18 21:55:16 Lmao I told her she's washed up
963 2018-07-18 21:55:16 On a different note, I’ve been using  an eye cream and serum cream under my face lotion, and I’m loving the results. My skin is oily combination, but I really think I produce so much oil because my skin is thirsty af. So extra moisture is helping with the oily ness
964 2018-07-18 21:55:03 olbas oil
965 2018-07-18 21:54:56 I’ve got a 2014 in that color/package with manual transmission and I love it.
966 2018-07-18 21:54:54 What about the cos. who did stock by backs? What about the $1000 bonuses eaten up by higher gas/oil from TRUMP/WALL ST. TRAITORS? What about the provable declining hour wages? What about the 32.5 million hard working Americans who got nothing?
967 2018-07-18 21:54:47 Powdered oil?
968 2018-07-18 21:54:37 All i wanna say is men’s razors and olive oil>>>>women’s razors and shaving cream

970 2018-07-18 21:54:09 If that paint had lead in it then yes can be very bad for the kid negatively affecting intelligence & fertility later in life if not detoxed.  Parents only let your kids play in lead free paint.  For first aid after full body lead paint exposure dunk kid in a tubfull olive oil.
971 2018-07-18 21:54:07 You all are so so ignorant! Really! I can't believe how blind u all are! Good luck with your confirmed conman! Have u received your snake oil order yet?
972 2018-07-18 21:54:06 Oil change
973 2018-07-18 21:53:51 i just used an anti-cellulite oil thingy bc i thought it would soothen the pain in my thighs from running too much but nOW THIS SHIT IS BURNING
974 2018-07-18 21:53:44 Coconut oil might work. i normally use peanut though.
975 2018-07-18 21:53:44 Revenue neutral tax. Can’t burn oil forever
976 2018-07-18 21:53:30 remember that part where winwin thought he had figured it all out and then he just fucking added OIL into COLD WATER. this bitch be dumb as hell but his cuteness makes up for it sksnsnsk
977 2018-07-18 21:53:21 yes, i know (that's a scary one). meant more on oil price and market conditions in general. so many factors to consider...
978 2018-07-18 21:53:18 My grandfather used to make popcorn like that: electric burner on high, oil and kernels in a steel pan with lid on. Just leave it on there till it's mostly popped. Benefit of this method is the shells get charred and soft.

Also he put on Johnny's Salt seasoning salt. Good Stuff.
979 2018-07-18 21:52:53 Yes enough space junk up there could reduce the amount of heat from the sun getting in and then we can happily get back into burning coal and oil like there will be no tomorrow.
980 2018-07-18 21:52:47 Sitting in a body shop waiting for my oil to be changed and a woman just came in with gift cards for two workers who were super helpful and honest about her car issue. Kindness does exist 
981 2018-07-18 21:52:43 Jungle makes me want to drench myself in pomba gira oil, dance for rich foreign men, & drain their pockets 
982 2018-07-18 21:52:24 So my boyfriend was getting his oil changed and they vacuumed his car for free (????) and he said there was a tampon on the floor that fell out of my purse and it was awkward, and my inner feminist was amused
983 2018-07-18 21:52:00 Actually it’s revenue neutral. Can’t burn oil forever!
984 2018-07-18 21:51:46 All about oil.

your greens! Are you using good olive oil? A squeeze of lemon? Always a classic. Ooh, look at you with the buttermilk- how daring!

990 2018-07-18 21:51:02 Relative to Sweet crude oil...what a day!!!!! I would say that if you were on the right side of the market today...your earnings were good today; however, I feel for you if you were on the wrong side of the market today....you took a real hit today. #Oil #Commodities

992 2018-07-18 21:50:51 @CitiTVGH Mr Tsegah you are a strategist, we need to entice students with incentives to be Day students, for boarding to pay 4 boarding as an option.
The point is the fund is not there to sponsor so why kill ourselves for policy that is not viable. What of if our crude oil dips?
993 2018-07-18 21:50:41 I just took my first dose of Charlotte's Web CBD oil & applied the lotion to areas that hurt 24/7. It's an expensive leap of faith but I'm very hopeful that @CWHemp will at least help my insomnia even if it doesn't help my pain. #Fibromyalgia #ChronicPain

Yup and she might just give up on relationships-

1000 2018-07-18 21:49:27 my wife does an amazing leeks in cheese sauce, but we're trying to find contrasting textures and tastes to serve it with.

peppers cooked in olive oil and lime so far, but we need something new to add

1002 2018-07-18 21:49:21 If anyone ever needs energy ask Brenna she has an essential oil for that
1003 2018-07-18 21:49:12 Crazy Chris, the worst sanctions in America’s history are being put forth at this time? Trying to get Germany to cut the pipeline and stop buying oil from them? Damn, am I missing something???
1004 2018-07-18 21:49:08 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
1005 2018-07-18 21:49:04 Agreed on both London/mercs. I know of one instance where his “army” took over an oil production plant after his friend was removed from power. As I said, many red flags. Just not sure there’s enough yet to rightfully implicate Powell’s wife. Her donor info comes back soon. 
1006 2018-07-18 21:49:00 Thank you Minister Phillips.  Perhaps you could suggest they tax our coal and oil exports as a way of signaling thier virtue. See how that goes over.

1009 2018-07-18 21:48:42 Gotta go to the gym today but I got a 7 am oil change appointment 
1010 2018-07-18 21:48:31 The Nanny State creeps want to sanction Russian gas production, but last week they asked Russia to increase oil production to lower oil prices, I'd say a "go to hell" is in order.
1011 2018-07-18 21:48:20 Oil reservoir or pressure tank, I'm not sure. I've never disassembled a shock absorber...
1012 2018-07-18 21:48:07 Okay so we have plastic dinosaurs.  Plastic is made from oil.  Oil is made from fossils.  Fossils are made from dead dinosaurs.. sooo.. technically we are making toy dinosaurs out of dead dinosaurs 
1013 2018-07-18 21:48:00 Ahh, yes, more tiger balm and medicated oil, come at me.

1017 2018-07-18 21:47:29 Horrible news!! Anything to be done? Can we stop it? So so sad this palm oil crap.
1018 2018-07-18 21:47:22 Did you happen to hear that Angela Merkel just signed a huge contract with Russia so that Germany gets all their oil from them. Undermines your little story about Obama’s greatness a tad.
1019 2018-07-18 21:47:21 highhhhhkey, every minute “just a bit of olive oil” bro it’s too much
1020 2018-07-18 21:47:04 play snake oil coward !!!
1021 2018-07-18 21:46:52 I think this occurred bc the Obama administration was dead-set to topple Assad, so funneled guns & money to terrorist mercenaries (that Americans thought we were against) and allowed these groups to produce & transport oil to fight Assad more effectively. I'm embarrassed.

1: Beat an egg in a small bowl and then add a teaspoon each of honey, cream, and olive oil.
2: Mix well to form a smooth paste and apply it all over the hair.

worker: you need a new air filter, windshield wipers, back right rim & a new windshield 


1026 2018-07-18 21:46:33 Absolutely.  Truck drivers in the oil fields in Texas are making $75,000 and all they have to obtain is a commercial drivers license and a clean drug screening!
1027 2018-07-18 21:46:32  They aren't flipping out..It's just extremely rare this time of year or any time in L.A. unlike F5s for Midwesterners
I hated driving in LA after rain... The year old oil slick on the roads rises & sucks 
1028 2018-07-18 21:46:24 I feel sorry! In a second look I noticed was (very) wrong. The Thermax label is only for measuring the temperature in the oil reservoir.

1032 2018-07-18 21:45:54 True. The tech exists to eliminate the need for oil based conflict, or nuclear contamination risk.  The problem is the patents are confiscated and shelves by the govt. all prototypes are seized and shelves or destroyed if they’ve already got something like it.

1058 2018-07-18 21:41:49 Well everyone’s skin is different so I wouldn’t be able to give advise based on yours specifically but I can say that it is great for sensitive and acne-prone skin. Read the reviews on our site. Most complaints is that it is matte, but you just use our oil for that:)
1059 2018-07-18 21:41:40 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1060 2018-07-18 21:41:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1081 2018-07-18 21:39:38 Not to mention pushing OPEC to increase oil production, which is no favor to Russian oil interests. I've been saying for years now that if Russia paid for Trump's campaign, they got shafted on the deal royally and should demand their money back.
1082 2018-07-18 21:39:35 Then there is oil. Oh say 240,000,000 tons of oil and ng annually. About $60,000,000,000 at $50 per ton. Why not tax that. Why diddle the citizens of Canada?
1083 2018-07-18 21:39:30 You think this is the EU? You need to look at the anti-trust legislation in the US. Look at Srandard Oil. The original monopoly. I think your beliefs are overwhelming you.

1093 2018-07-18 21:38:48 The US & coalition went to the defense of Kuwait because of oil, not to preserve a democracy. Not really relevant though. The US could have protected itself better but politics gave Russia a free hand. That's the fault of the US.

1108 2018-07-18 21:36:45 Three accused Trinitarios gang members (illegals) charged with killing Bronx teen Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz...should be dropped in a vat of hot oil and burned alive!
1109 2018-07-18 21:36:35 My favorite by far is Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo...its never steered me wrong.
1110 2018-07-18 21:36:34 If someone had told me that this was an oil pan for an S4 or an R8, I would have probably believed them.
1111 2018-07-18 21:36:28 You would think the city would embrace a concept that greatly reduces fossil fuel emissions. Big Oil much?
1112 2018-07-18 21:36:22 @Google If you look at the original anti trust case against Standard Oil, that created the premise for this whole way of thinking that Europe is copying, the whole thing was a reflection of the government being out of touch with reality. 

At best a publicity stunt by politicians
1113 2018-07-18 21:36:21 Niebla Roja said that last night his brother Angel de Oro asked who his second would be in title match & Roja replied, "You!" He then claims Angel de Oro told him he had to get ready, comb his hair, oil up, etc.

1120 2018-07-18 21:35:38 In 18 mos, Trump raised hell with Merkel over Russian oil. He ejected 69 Russians, closed several consulates.

1128 2018-07-18 21:34:52 you mean that the oil prices were so high fracking became profitable, and the Saudis increased production to drive them out of business, using market forces opposite what Dems wanted, then yes. And when is Mueller going to Russia to interview the people he indicted? #MuellerTime
1129 2018-07-18 21:34:51 I'd call Trump a snake oil salesman but I fear that does a grave disservice to the many fine purveyors of reptilian-based oil products
1130 2018-07-18 21:34:44 How does a carbon tax create more jobs and enrich Canadians? Will the feds tax oil and coal exports. At $50 per ton of co2 a ton of coal generates $120. Vancouver exports 35,000,000 tons of coal annually to the far East. Call it $4,200,000,000 in revenues.

1144 2018-07-18 21:31:58 Venezuela’s state-owned oil company used to be a model. Then it became a piggy bank for a misguided socialist revolution. https://foreign

1146 2018-07-18 21:31:57 coordinated attack.  drones were delivered to Houthis via Emirates and today one of the drones was fired at Saudi Aramco refinery after Saudi intelligence gave Houthis the coordinates of the refinery.  why?  to get oil prices to rise.

1152 2018-07-18 21:31:24 It's really odd to me that when the maids came today they took down the pictures of me and my ex-gf, staked them in a pile upside down and left them on the table in the next room. They also stole 2 bottles of essential oil / half the change from the cup I empty my pockets into.

You ma'am, are clearly ignorant on the subject, and I strongly recommend moving. Lukemia, really??????
1156 2018-07-18 21:31:05 Hate frying chicken. A bitch gotta go to war with hot oil splatter
1157 2018-07-18 21:31:03 While fat isn't evil, too much trans fats & unsaturated fats might lead to health problems. Swapping oil for Greek yogurt is the perfect way to cut down on "unhealthy" fats, while improving the taste

1160 2018-07-18 21:30:55 Oh, and Leicester City winning the Premier League is a far more impressive feat than an oil backed, Pep managed City league title win.

1169 2018-07-18 21:30:13 Is it okay to put vitamin e oil on just by itself? Or should it be used with something else
1170 2018-07-18 21:29:59 But having said that, we also need to protect these areas from the worst humans - poachers, loggers, fishers, miners, palm oil. people are needed for management in that sense.
1171 2018-07-18 21:29:51 I love ramen. But frying the noodles in oil instead of boiling them is an idea I just had, and it needs to happen.
1172 2018-07-18 21:29:45 Olive oil also makes sauces stick less to your pasta, so depending on the sauce you intend to serve them with, giving the pasta a quick wash with cold water after taking them out of the pot has the same effect of them not sticking to each other.
1173 2018-07-18 21:29:42 Please remember to add towel, oil and frying pan to the list

You've just had 1 glorious league season, but great sides do much more than that, over long periods of time.

Will Pep and the oil money be around to build such a dynasty?
1184 2018-07-18 21:27:58 I just took my car to the shop to get a free oil change & ended up paying $405 for some other shit 
1185 2018-07-18 21:27:54 Its about time. Pipelines are necessary. As long as all the safeguards are in place it's the most sensible solution for getting oil to markets.

YOUR president is Not Putin's puppet.
1190 2018-07-18 21:27:02 @jesse_b_waters trump didn't talk tough to Putin in the presser but neither did  putin talk tough to trump, no backlash for interfering with Germany oil line, putting the missile shield back up, the presser was NOT the place for theatrics,
1191 2018-07-18 21:26:59 Fr. Tired of people thinking oily = strip off every ounce of oil off the face until it’s dry. I wanted less oily skin not to immediately switch to an dry, ashy face. One day they’ll learn.

1198 2018-07-18 21:26:22 Why shouldn't an oil company pay for consultancy in defense of its self interests?
1199 2018-07-18 21:26:22 Is it extra virgin olive oil

1202 2018-07-18 21:26:17 I was thinking aloud on Twitter last night but I’d be very surprised if that is not the answer as to why it’s showing no real benefit in these tests, ppl need to respect what fish oil is & how it should be taken & handled
1203 2018-07-18 21:26:15 Well several ways to redistribute public income back to the public:
Alaska takes it oil wealth gives each person a dividend on profits
North Dakota: Has a public bank, with no interest charged, profits back to the state
Local cities keep money locally and invest it
Blockchain it
1204 2018-07-18 21:26:08 It's like when the US sued Rockefeller, and he said, Hey, if it wasn't for me you guys would all be trying to run your engines on whale oil -- how did that work for you?
1205 2018-07-18 21:26:05 This oil change is taking up my whole day :c

1207 2018-07-18 21:25:34 yo i burned the fuck out of my hand with hot oil trying to flip a tortilla, is the burn supposed to hurt this much ??   
1208 2018-07-18 21:25:32 And why is that good? Europe is not oil/ng rich. North Sea is not like the Middle East. Germany agreed to the pipeline in the 2000s when Russia was,apparently, trying to make inroads in the West so the continent wouldn’t continue its reliance on the ME.
1209 2018-07-18 21:25:20 Dry brushing and coconut oil leaves the skin so dewy and soft. I like to whip together coconut oil vitamin E and either vanilla or lavender
1210 2018-07-18 21:24:51 As long as your side is painted then it’s good enough. There is also a protective gloss which helps it from the rain and snow. If you need the paint of your hands, use a bit of cooking oil and lather it like soap. It should take the majority of paint off.
1211 2018-07-18 21:24:40 #pnpcbc while there is no way I support @fordnation @Frod_Nation climate denial I also can't support the Liberal's totally inadequate climate strategy that includes pushing oil production from the world's dirtiest source. Pipelines are not a climate plan.

1213 2018-07-18 21:24:26 Three cups olive oil, one cup hydrogen-peroxide. Rinse and repeat. Do this 3 times a day. Your skin will disappear within weeks!

1215 2018-07-18 21:24:22 I think I’m about to become a crazy oil person.
1216 2018-07-18 21:24:21 delicious as always. i like to sautee onions and garlic in olive oil before browning the meat

1221 2018-07-18 21:23:55 I remember that dude. I wonder where he is now. I guess there's lots of gas stations and oil change joints to work at.

1225 2018-07-18 21:23:28 I don’t know, maybe taste like engine oil?

1228 2018-07-18 21:22:56 its amazing how many people are uneducated when it comes to oil & gas operations, specifically in Colorado. If oil & gas operations are halted by a 2500 ft setback measure come November, the Colorado economy will collapse. #oilandgasisColorado
1229 2018-07-18 21:22:54 #ukog HH all the trolls and naysayers can no longer shout there is no oil it wont be viable or commercial...well I say they can no longer say it but they will even when we are in full production and paying dividends they will still be shouting about it ..

- Maybe covered in oil

We're needing inspiration okay
1231 2018-07-18 21:22:50 I think for rice the ideal ratio is like 1.95 to one but also it really helps if you wash the rice and throw in some oil and spices. Idk. My rice cooker is extremely basic.

1238 2018-07-18 21:22:04 Sure, moderate consumption of alchohol is okay, after all, "Wine to make glad the heart of man, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart" (PS 104:15)
1239 2018-07-18 21:21:48 bullshit reak like oil leakkk
1240 2018-07-18 21:21:25 I accuse Colonel Chili oil of committing the crime in the in the ocean with the lead pipe!
1241 2018-07-18 21:20:50 In a high and not too big pan heat very little oil and brown the pancetta, then add the classic minced carrot, celery and onion cut by hand .Fry over a gentle heat stirring with a wooden spoon and making sure that the vegetables do not burn, then add the meat and raise the heat.
1242 2018-07-18 21:20:50 Maybe not, however what I have found is that you use a lot of oil funded pseudo-science to back your claims and certainly promote those involved with it. Btw, do you advertise on your blog or make any money whatsoever from your efforts or public appearances??
1243 2018-07-18 21:20:46 I was in the same one! It was amazing! The red MAGA hats, the smell of patchouli oil, the lower tax rates, and the strong beard game were so enthralling!
1244 2018-07-18 21:20:46 Un pelotudo a fuel oil venezolano!
1245 2018-07-18 21:20:36 what jokes okay so it's a oil still a scientific reason I don't I don't know what your argument is or even if it's an argument I'll reread your Tweet after this I guess

1247 2018-07-18 21:20:20 1) We agree (mostly). The article was comparing charging an EV with the current power grid in the US, which burns oil and gas for a significant portion of the power portfolio.
1248 2018-07-18 21:20:19 That's quite a non sequitur my friend.
This is about a fake vision about our energy future from incumbent oil and gas.

1251 2018-07-18 21:19:48 What are people’s thoughts on Cannabidiol (CBD)? I just saw there’s a new cannabis oil shop open in Dublin. I suppose it’s a controversial one but the list of supposed benefits is impressive 
1252 2018-07-18 21:19:48 
1253 2018-07-18 21:19:48 Geezer I know is on the cannabis oil.
Reckons it's a real health straightener............
A couple of small drops a day(the size of a grain of rice) and he feels better than ever.
Hes 42 years old......
I'm tempted.......
1254 2018-07-18 21:19:46 Extra Virgin Olive Oil... Hiyooooo!
1255 2018-07-18 21:19:46 SKYF received letters of intent from several big oil & gas companies (NGK Slavneft, PAO SIBUR Holding) and agricultural industry (Syngenta AG, Avgust Crop Protection, Rusagro Group, Prodimex), willing to use the SKYF drone services.

1256 2018-07-18 21:19:40 Secondly the oil industry you represent/chair imports crude oil; did it not feel the pinch during the cooking oil shortage due to bad currency wiping good currency on the market? I mean can we say bond notes have been good to business?
1257 2018-07-18 21:19:34 Pray for people you trust to develop the courage to speak honest truth into your life. It hurts in the moment. But it’s results are rewarding.

“Let a righteous man strike me - it is a kindness; let him rebuke me - it is oil on my head.” -Psalm 141:5
1258 2018-07-18 21:19:22 Because he’s a snake oil salesmen and says what they want to hear
1259 2018-07-18 21:19:20 Did a bitch just leave her car for an oil change, and is currently taking a Lyft to get her hair did and done??? Yes. Ya girl is making mooooves. My dad is SHAKING!
1260 2018-07-18 21:19:13 and when he came, was it used fryer oil
1261 2018-07-18 21:19:10 you know how cops beat the shit out of the water protectors at standing rock because they didn’t want a giant oil pipeline running through their land?

1264 2018-07-18 21:19:05 Pffft. That’s what we do anyway. 

BTW, barrel after barrel of oil is skimmed from the surface of the ocean off the coast of California. 

Why?

“...Up from the ground come a bubblin’ crude...”
1265 2018-07-18 21:19:01 The problem is the road has a lot of oil built up over time which doesn’t mix with water. And the oil slick is on top - very dangerous conditions.
1266 2018-07-18 21:18:57 Oh no, please give me her name again so that we may pray for her. I also have some prayer aprons/cloths that I can anoint with oil from Israel & send to you to put in her pillow.

1268 2018-07-18 21:18:38 Russia doesn't abide by N Korea sanctions, they are still selling them oil covertly by ship.
1269 2018-07-18 21:18:33 They also have an electronic diffuser which dispenses the oil scent & i hear a drop is all u need per time & the scent is ever lasting. However its pricey. Electronic diffuser 11k, oil 3-7k.
1270 2018-07-18 21:18:30 First off. oil & gas has been around in Colorado almost as long as it has been a state, secondly, oil and gas operations have ZERO links to "causing" Leukemia lol get out of here with these lies. #oilandgasISColorado

1273 2018-07-18 21:18:06 That’s good news considering your administration recently filed a complaint with the U.N. about Russia’s sale of oil and refined products in violation of the sanctions.
1274 2018-07-18 21:18:05 Hopefully the chipotle lime mayo is better than that brands regular avocado oil mayo. It definitely has a distinct taste
1275 2018-07-18 21:17:54 What happens when run out of oil and soil goes dry and we can’t turn the lights on? Then who’s going to be an icon?
1276 2018-07-18 21:17:51 Did you get that off the back of your beard oil box

1279 2018-07-18 21:16:52 No. I really took issue with the one where people winced at Pesto. FFS  it’s just ground basil and olive oil with a little bit of Parmesan. And some pine nuts.
1280 2018-07-18 21:16:48 @marcorubio @SpeakerRyan how do you like being linked to #HelinskiHumilation and being known as #helinskireoublicans?  You thought he was your puppet but Putin bought him and you! You have been played by the greatest oil salesman. Simply disgusting.
1281 2018-07-18 21:16:40 Yea that's crazy. You can $30-40 for the oil and filter.
1282 2018-07-18 21:16:40 PSA: Do NOT cook pantsless, oil burns are inevitable
1283 2018-07-18 21:16:31 Ok McKenna, anything you own with oil products, get rid of. Don’t drive, don’t jet set around the world! Stop it all. Show us how it’s done missy!

1287 2018-07-18 21:16:17 Probably used baby oil as a lubricant when it lost it's virginity.
1288 2018-07-18 21:16:17 Dick Cheney, and the Genie Oil Co. of New Jersey, along with the usual suspects, [Murdock Rothchild etc.], are pushing for a takeover of the oil rich Golan Heights in Syria, an already war torn nation. Not even the Greeks have a word to describe how evil some people are.
1289 2018-07-18 21:16:15 Not to mention they went threw with the Dakota Pipeline. Not even a year after they put it in it started to leak oil in the river, these big industries are disgusting and care nothing of POC, especially Native Americans.
1290 2018-07-18 21:16:09 Well....that's what they CALL them. LOL! Basically it's like a beignet, except the batter is thinner and you drizzle it into the hot oil.

1293 2018-07-18 21:16:01 Except it's oil, not condensation, so somebody's got jokes.
1294 2018-07-18 21:15:51 Don't forget they also fall really easily for a certain brand of snake oil phony religion too. A lethal combination for weaponizing malicious idiots.
1295 2018-07-18 21:15:44 haha I know I know!!! The only one I can understand is oil....but other than that I am like NO WAY!! I mean when it comes to sex scenes I like it to be realistic and believable.

1301 2018-07-18 21:14:30 Well maybe they should look for the person who is pouring olive oil in/ on the statue! 
1302 2018-07-18 21:14:25 In the context of the modern diet high in Omega 6 vegetable oils, I'm not surprised that supplementing with Omega 3 oil was ineffective.

1305 2018-07-18 21:14:09 They should sell her in the grocery store. Extra Virgin Mary Olive Oil. Rachael Ray would have a field day with the EVMOO acronym.
1306 2018-07-18 21:13:51 WAkE UP! If grocery items' list palm oil as an ingredient, make an alternate purchase! Also, GO VEGAN to decrease the amount of land used for growing feed for factory farm animals.
1307 2018-07-18 21:13:50 I'll bet if you wipe down a statue with olive oil and it gets very warm it'll look like it's weeping olive oil.

1330 2018-07-18 21:10:56 For what it's worth, there is a pile of evidence to support CBD oil as a viable complimentary treatment. It can do no harm to the kid and may just well be of benefit.

1337 2018-07-18 21:10:11 I seem to remember another president that promised to protect & put America first. He spied on Americans, left Americans to die in Benghazi & gave $150B to our enemies in the middle of the night. He tried to undermine oil production. He was a true traitor.

1349 2018-07-18 21:08:47 Went minin' for some gold and struck oil
1350 2018-07-18 21:08:43 When I was an oil company housewife in Houston, lots of the Chevron people lived in Sugarland.  I thought it creepy then.  Now I realize it is haunted.
1351 2018-07-18 21:08:33 Still very cheap imo. A bag or two in it yet for sure. Kim zones are key and we know they have oil. Lock and load
1352 2018-07-18 21:08:30 The lengths I go for a free oil change.
1353 2018-07-18 21:08:27 CBD oil on its own will not help he needs full spectrum from a specific strain of cannabis.
1354 2018-07-18 21:08:24 Females really call themselves “car girls” while driving an automatic & talking about “all my car needs is tints & rims” like huh sis? You make us car girls look bad. Let me see you change your oil
1355 2018-07-18 21:08:20 For those interested in buying or selling CBD Oil in Canada, it's coming very soon. Get in touch with me, and I'll get you started.
1356 2018-07-18 21:08:07 The rich ladies get laser-blasted, botoxed and filled - they dont' get that rich lady look from luxury products, which work no better than Oil of Olay. It's why the stars coo about their favorite drugstore products in magazines.
1357 2018-07-18 21:08:04 Felt like tweeting something so...YO! This is a reminder to get your oil changed cos I know some of y’all need it!!
1358 2018-07-18 21:08:01 Officially lost my mind yelling at myself about not doing enough of my to-do list only to find I don't have anything left on the list and to then go on and yell at myself to keep it down...

Neighbor is cooking with sesame oil though, so the aroma is bang on 
1359 2018-07-18 21:08:01 People are mad because Starbucks is selling a commemorative mug for Colorado. (Other states too) the mug has drawings of trees, bikes, rivers and oil rigs. People are mad at the oil rigs. It's silly. False outrage.
1360 2018-07-18 21:08:01 Depends on your roller but try 5 drops of lemon and peppermint and just 2 of pepper (if you use it) and you can always add more and then top with a carrier oil like coconut or almond 
1361 2018-07-18 21:08:00 Hope someone is responsible enough to clean, oil and maintain this equipment. Also, Nothing worse than a dead batteries in an emergency!
1362 2018-07-18 21:07:58 Indeed. Any claims like £200m to set up an Indy Scotland, a new oil boom with £8bn revenues, a currency union with UK and tariff free trade...all such lies I’m sure you will now condemn utterly-along with any claims that the loss of Fiscal Transfer isn’t deeply damaging.

1367 2018-07-18 21:07:33 Levant's been pretty consistently into it. He joined Canada's Reform Party as a teenager : like an even straighter-laced Tory party, but further right, representing the interests of western Canada (esp oil). It helped create Harper, our 10-yr Canadian experiment w dictatorship.
1368 2018-07-18 21:07:29 Best way I can put this humidity is that it’s like oil,when the heat is dry u can get indoors and essentially won’t even hot anymore (may take a min too cool off but u won’t be hot) similar to when u touch a hot coal soon as u stop it’s no longer hot, but this humidity different
1369 2018-07-18 21:07:17 . @amoshochstein tells @AtlanticCouncil that the Trump administration, despite its hawkish rhetoric, doesn't yet know if there will be waivers on #Iran 's oil exports. will be lots of tradeoffs re other issues and administration will also be sensitive to the price of oil

1373 2018-07-18 21:06:57 I can't believe Obama did nothing to stop the Mer-people from stealing your job, Julian.  I'm so sorry for you.  This never would have happened if we had just doubled down on oil spills!
1374 2018-07-18 21:06:57 Your car needs an oil change or something huh? That’s why you’re out here scamming everyone smh
1375 2018-07-18 21:06:56 Fuck how’s there no oil in this house and I already started making pupusas this some bull shit
1376 2018-07-18 21:06:45 Worse - When Obama learned of their hacks he had his people stand down and enabled it.  Pattern? Anyone remember how ISIS got started and how O was worried about collateral damage so he blocked bombing of their source of revenue, stolen oil?
1377 2018-07-18 21:06:41 Speaking and saying what? If people need to see olive oil dripping off a statue to affirm their faith, they don't have much faith.
1378 2018-07-18 21:06:23 ตื่นมาทาคาลาไม อห
1379 2018-07-18 21:06:21 I’m having my oil changed and there’s this mom and her two kids on the couch across the room and the little boy wants to watch Teletubbies. The mom, with the straighest face ever, goes “Absolutely not. You can watch Hellraiser for all I care but not Teletubbies” and I’m SCREAMING
1380 2018-07-18 21:06:19 Cucumbers + iceberg lettuce + red onions + avocado + green apple and the stars of the show—my dried tomatoes in olive oil that have been sitting in their juices for a couple weeks  and a sprinkle of some Italian cheeses. 
Oh, and a splash of red wine vinaigrette
1381 2018-07-18 21:06:11 Absolutely. Not sure about legalizing marijuana.  I know it would take a big bite, but I am on the fence with that.  I agree legalizing for medical purposes. But, the oil can be effective without the buzz.

1384 2018-07-18 21:05:49 Spilled olive oil in kitchen = #HelpMeObiWanKenobi Just when I thought I was done mopping up, an oil slick appeared under the toaster. #OhTheAgony. #amwriting despite the roadblocks!
1385 2018-07-18 21:05:49 If we ended Oil and Gas Subsidies (that we still paid for), end "Corp write offs, tax cuts and "Business write offs for loses (when they're sued for polluting us)..They might just pay a little taxes towards the roads, schools & bridges we build, for their kids, and their truck.
1386 2018-07-18 21:05:46 I bought frozen fries and since my ass is scared of hot splashing oil I'mma bake them lmao
1387 2018-07-18 21:05:36 What I would do to just dip even just my finger in ole oil 
1388 2018-07-18 21:05:19 just went and got my oil changed and afterward there was an empty pack of *confused inhale* peanut butter dingdongs on my passenger seat
1389 2018-07-18 21:05:13 I love making the checkout girl at my local shop feel awkward by going to the till with just a cucumber and a bottle of baby oil.
1390 2018-07-18 21:05:11 The African continent is a land rich with resources. See abundance in agriculture, minerals, oil, and intellectual capacity YET corrupt politicians, officials, and archaic + imperial ideologies keep our nations in the dark ages. The tables are turning, but very slowly
1391 2018-07-18 21:04:47 this was meant to rattle Canada only - Canada is not rattled - will soon turn off the oil and electricity
1392 2018-07-18 21:04:12 I really think the Koch bros. aren't getting enough credit for screwing the rest of us. Yeah, Putin had the RU army on it, and lots & lots of U.S. traitors did their part, but now look how the evil oil brothers are making out at our expense. Anything to set back the pulic good!
1393 2018-07-18 21:04:10 8000 kilometres is roughly 5000 miles. So still when you told me to change my oil every 3000 miles that wasn’t correct based on information I’ve been told my whole adult life.
1394 2018-07-18 21:03:52 If no oil is consumed in Scotland  (bought by end user) then no Duty or VAT revenue will be raised.  But if it is, then revenue value does not change based on where oil came from.
1395 2018-07-18 21:03:45 TIP OF THE DAY
Sorry but latest studies involving over 100,000 people have come to the surprising but definitive conclusion that omega 3 fish oil supplements do not protect your heart as believed.  Need to get your omega 3 from fatty fish and other food items
1396 2018-07-18 21:03:43 California's economy is not 'sustainable'.  Without the cell phone plants and automobile industry, no Uber.  Without products being produced and sold, no google.  Without oil investments, no banks. Without global supply chain no food corps. Without industry, no LinkedIN.
1397 2018-07-18 21:03:38 Running out of fish oil pills, its that time
1398 2018-07-18 21:03:26 I was wondering if he chose, vegetable, corn or olive oil.

1402 2018-07-18 21:02:53 Why did you tag me on this tweet?

Also, your point, regardless of its  merits, is a complete non-sequitur from the content of the FT article.

Also, this is an *oil* production issue. Not natural gas.
1403 2018-07-18 21:02:44 compare Denmark to Iraq or Syria. The former has zero natural resource but is judged the happiest nation on earth while the oil rich Arab countries have destroyed themselves over centuries. They don’t deserve a free pass in Europe
1404 2018-07-18 21:02:35 Maybe God is Italian and trying to tell us that Olive Oil is the key to going into heaven. GET CHUGGING
1405 2018-07-18 21:02:31 I have heard so many stories like that. Two drops CBD oil under my tongue twice a day- drastic pain reduction. There is no cure but I am functional again.

1413 2018-07-18 21:02:10 Try using coconut oil on his beard to make it softer, it shouldn’t irritate as much x
1414 2018-07-18 21:02:07 but the do have land with gas and oil - resources which our best traded with, as opposed to any sort of military interventions or raids.
1415 2018-07-18 21:02:00 Sorry you had to endure such a horrible experience. Millions, maybe billions of bbls of oil are transported.  It’s a pretty safe record overall. Reducing our reliance on oil must be done carefully, not shotgun style. Families depend on it to live, not just big oil profits.

1419 2018-07-18 21:01:09 Trump's already gotten the Russian mili8tary out of Syria, after our eradication of several hundred of his contractors, and allowing for near daily bombardment of Iranian forces. Days before the summit Russian then announced compliance with sanctions on Iranian oil exports.
1420 2018-07-18 21:01:09 Great answers and I agree 100%, this Gov has done a good job for Alberta! Given the mess things were in at the Leg when they took over and the GLOBAL (for those who don’t understand that it wasn’t an NDP or an AB thing - global means worldwide) slip in oil prices. 
1421 2018-07-18 21:00:59 Damn I need to get an oil change this weekend. Always something

Are you on meds as well? My aunt wants to try it for her epilepsy but she's worried it'll interfere with meds and she's just found a combo that works for her so it's :(

1437 2018-07-18 20:59:18 I know, right? Shouldn’t it be tears? Maybe Himalayan pink salt tears but not olive oil.
Actually, Sriracha sauce would be better.
1438 2018-07-18 20:58:59 Oh dear. More regime change. Have you discovered oil under Nicaragua, Michael old chap?

1445 2018-07-18 20:58:12 So never understood the system in the first place? In some industries (e.g. chemical/oil processing) that's unacceptable. In which industries is it acceptable to not know impacts on outcomes of every link in the chain.

1459 2018-07-18 20:55:45 ...so that we could control land, oil, ports and bases. We placed the Shah and Saddam in power. We tried to assisnate Castro. We did many egregious things in Vietnam. We are the only country to use atomic weapons...so don’t blame Trump and his morals.

1474 2018-07-18 20:53:17 Oil change on a Bugatti costs $21,000. The car's engine surround has to be disassembled. Takes 16 quarts of oil. But it's faster than an Austin :-)
1475 2018-07-18 20:53:11 the revenue the oil industry pulls in goes to the shareholders, and they want to keep it that way. Electricity is a public utility who's profits go to public programs.
1476 2018-07-18 20:52:50 Taxes will rise and it will be pumped into free shs since the oil money isn't enough

1481 2018-07-18 20:52:09 Um we all want and need change.  But in order to measure and instigate change you have to understand how the basic economics and geopolitical issues work.  If you dont, youre selling nothing more than snake oil.

1504 2018-07-18 20:48:59 Like, I still can't fathom how greyhound can't make a profit on what's a perpetually sold out oil run. There was 40+ people on it, on any of the 4+ runs a day they did, so naturally there's one late run now, before its cancelled. Eat shit.

That is when he wasn’t backing away from red lines. #Trump has armed Ukraine, increased defense spending, got allies to increase defense, implemented sanctions, added countries to NATO, increased oil and gas ...
1509 2018-07-18 20:48:31 Everytime I think I got it bad I always think there's someone who would be grateful to have my problems .. "man I'm pissed off I have to change my oil" .. "he's lucky to have a car to get to change the oil ,I have to take the bus ".. "he's lucky to have money to take the bus"

1517 2018-07-18 20:47:59 why is my oil change so expensive
1518 2018-07-18 20:47:55 What, are you shilling for Big Oil now? What about wind from Gov. Gasbag?
1519 2018-07-18 20:47:51 This guy changing my oil was yelling to the other guy my filter number, and I thought he was talking to me so I responded “yeah”. And now he keeps joking with me about it & offered me a job here. This is why I never go and get my oil changed.
1520 2018-07-18 20:47:44 #ukog #Horsehill today proved to the dodgy doubters just because SCC made UKOG shut in the well   for 2 years oil flow hasn't gone away. Far from it. Wait for the Kimmeridge to come Gushing out in huge amounts Again soon to! Viva!
1521 2018-07-18 20:47:42 Well I drive more carefully each year. Oil change every 6k. Anything that goes wrong with it will be way cheaper to fix than buying a new cab.

1524 2018-07-18 20:47:26 I'm European. The funny thing or bizarre thing is that 2/3rds of Germans see Trump as the number 1 enemy of Germany...maybe because Putin gives them Petrol oil and natural gas. Trump has to wake up and stop kissing Erdogan's and Putin's ass, the evil Duo.
1525 2018-07-18 20:47:19 I wouldn't be happy in a rainforest

1527 2018-07-18 20:47:10 You know when you put it in hot oil and it makes that shririririririri sound! Priceless!!!!
1528 2018-07-18 20:47:10 @NicolleDWallace Trump seems to believe that the American military should be a mercenary force. He wants NATO to pay us for defense. He said that we should have stayed in Iraq and "keep the oil". He wants the military to fight for profits. #Trump
1529 2018-07-18 20:47:07 I really hate how much oil they pour on your nails after they finish it. I mean it’s cute so why the oro oro?

Amy Goodman described how Chevron asked the Nigerian military to break up a protest on an oil rig. This resulted in 2 deaths. They also argued they were concerned about worker's safety
1634 2018-07-18 20:33:21 Engines as complex as Bugatti Veyron's would typically have oil extracted &/or forced out with pressure via machine specifically designed for engines with multiple oil galleries & it wouldn't be done like a simple oil change dripping from an American made vehicle etc.

1636 2018-07-18 20:32:49 If you add in North Dakota and other States we could be the number 1 producer in the world. Or was this taken into account? Sounds like the 60's thru 80's when Texas was gushing Oil! Only took 40 years for Technology to bring it back, WTG Texas!
1637 2018-07-18 20:32:46 I like fast food that oozes with twice-used oil and takes 5-7 years off my lifespan.
1638 2018-07-18 20:32:41 Yes, thank you indeed. Meanwhile, @RepStevePearce continues to embarrass his constituents. We’ve come to expect that. You can’t care about public land and the gas and oil lobby at the same time.
1639 2018-07-18 20:32:34 Jamaican castor oil  RT @Brieyonce: Are you using any serums or castor oil to help the process?
1640 2018-07-18 20:32:18 胡麻油白☆最近、離乳食にseeds oilを少し入れるといいと本で読んだので家にあったオーガニックの胡麻油白を1日1回ほんの少し離乳食に混ぜてあげる。胡麻油のあの独特な香りがないし高いのでなんとなく使わずだった胡麻油。使い道があって良かった。
1641 2018-07-18 20:32:17 Marshall’s has an organic cold pressed rosehips oil for like $6  pls hop on baby
1642 2018-07-18 20:32:10 Funny when he said he’s scared of red lights  then @EthanDolan said extra virgin olive oil just like @GraysonDolan maybe that’s why he’s scared of red lights thinks everyone’s Christian Gray 
1643 2018-07-18 20:32:06 They are following Putins orders and don’t let the orange idiot answer any questions. Makes you wonder who else in the Oval Office is in Putin’s pocket.
1644 2018-07-18 20:32:04 Never heard of that myself. Pdvsа is publishing crude oil prices in Chinese yuans but that's just Mаduro's whim.

@realDonaldTrump and his Republican stooges don't want diplomats

They don't want a State Dept

No domestic programs

1651 2018-07-18 20:31:06 The government of Uruguay has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Mindy Kaling in a wadmal wig.
1652 2018-07-18 20:30:46 Actually, there are a lot of good paying jobs, including engineering, in smaller towns in ND, TEX and other states where the oil & gas industry is growing. Production increases in the Permian are said to be held back by lack of workers.

1654 2018-07-18 20:30:42 Some of you posting that the olive oil was put there makes me wonder if you read the article. It states that there is video/cameras in the church and it shows no evidence of tapering.
1655 2018-07-18 20:30:41 I think having a black neighbour was caster oil for them. What a sacrifise wena

1664 2018-07-18 20:29:33 I made sugar scrub with coconut oil, vanilla extract and lavender oil and now I smell like a whole cupcake
1665 2018-07-18 20:29:28 Thanks babes, coconut  oil
1666 2018-07-18 20:29:02 Longest oil change I've ever had 
1667 2018-07-18 20:29:01 Speaking of which, I have olive oil from Puglia for you. And you left a book here.
1668 2018-07-18 20:28:58 "In Venezuela, for example, flaring fell 26 per cent last year, as the country’s oil production declined 12 per cent." That's wrong!
1669 2018-07-18 20:28:55 Toe wrestling... oil up
1670 2018-07-18 20:28:48 Washed my face with MY bar soap and moisturized with MY oil serum. I’m so geeked to say that lol
1671 2018-07-18 20:28:42 god probably thought we were getting towards the end of history with the roman empire and all, makes sense he would send jesus down at that time. i don't think he really anticipated we'd discover oil and television.

The prerequisites are below:
1. Must be an impulsive wave.
2. The target was in place.
3. The entry setup is pending or forming.
4. The odds of winning is close to 99.99% if not 100%.
5. The only trading that 'Bet the Farm' strategy can be applied.
1687 2018-07-18 20:26:17 Looks absolutely delicious! One suggestion perhaps( for optics) drizzling a bit of olive oil on the top of these dishes to give it more of a shine and further show off the vivacious colour of those tomatoes.
1688 2018-07-18 20:26:14 Oil money ni.
1689 2018-07-18 20:26:12 The same rules that govern oil tankers on the West Coast should apply to oil tankers on the East Coast
1690 2018-07-18 20:26:05 I took a literal minute to tweet. I’m on my way to back to back meetings with community boards that I’ve been appointed to. Tonight I’ll be writing postcards & this weekend I’ll be canvassing for local candidates. I also ran for office last year against an oil and gas employee.
1691 2018-07-18 20:26:04 As global warming continues apace water will become our new oil. Hopefully not to be squandered in the same way though

1699 2018-07-18 20:25:09 What sort of excuse is that?
1700 2018-07-18 20:24:55 Why use toxic mouthwashes when natural is so much better for you. Safe, effective and pennies per drop!

1705 2018-07-18 20:24:03 No. But Russia is helping North Korea avoid the sanctions by giving them oil transferred via freighters. #StopLying
1706 2018-07-18 20:23:57 Olive Oil < Virgin Olive Oil < Extra Virgin Olive Oil < Literal Sacred Virgin Tears.  I wanna drizzle some tears on my pizza.
1707 2018-07-18 20:23:54 Yeah, it's just another conflict with them, but the Sauids also had Clinton connections, through their foundation they worked out a $165 billion weapons deal. Obama's military also aided them against a government that functionally has nothing other than offshore oil.
1708 2018-07-18 20:23:36 Yeah I grew up with the Round Table buffet as well.  So damn good and a great value since their pizza is expensive.  (But worth it.)  Maybe I should open a franchise and bring it to TX. 

That's where we differ with PJs.  Their weird soybean oil "garlic" sauce can eat a dick.

1715 2018-07-18 20:22:46 Virgin Olive Oil ??
1716 2018-07-18 20:22:37 I brought my dog some CBD oil & if his ass don't corporate while i try to give him this .
1717 2018-07-18 20:22:29 When things get pretty hard in Nigeria, remember that there was once oil boom in the 70s and a Nigerian ruler once remarked publicly that Nigeria had so much money and the problem was how to spend it.

1730 2018-07-18 20:21:15 @TVietor08 great pod. Had a thought- if Germany is beholden to Russia because of pipelines and oil supply, does that make the US beholden to us Canadians who provide 40% of your imports?

1738 2018-07-18 20:20:03 Engines cause blow-by gases & it can be detrimental, as Oil Vapour &/or 'too much oil heated in sump' will rise via Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) System, under pressure & back through Air Intake(s) for gases/oil vapour to be recycled by engine & out through exhaust....
1739 2018-07-18 20:20:00 Is it the oil pump they put in it? I bet it’s coming from the pump.

1749 2018-07-18 20:19:04 Couldn't agree more with both of you  I know many people who crank midnight oil and don't experience burnout because they see their work being appreciated and recognized. The best way to improve #employeeadvocacy is through personal development! @tim_leake -Mike
1750 2018-07-18 20:19:03 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
1751 2018-07-18 20:18:59 I would say that the price of oil will be low for other countries that produce the oil, probably not getting much in monetary returns.
1752 2018-07-18 20:18:54 With the amount of oil on my face right now I could fry chicken

1763 2018-07-18 20:17:34  its not for everybody. I like it, only if it's cooked. It's good if add olive oil, salt, pepper, & fresh garlic (or garlic powder) & either saute or steam it (15-30 min), then add hot sauce.

1766 2018-07-18 20:17:27 More investment means more oil. But we can't produce more oil. Investment should go to other energy industries.

1776 2018-07-18 20:16:43 That is a lie. Obama cancelled the missile program (as a favor to Putin) his 1st yr in office. Until 2016 NatGas and oil sales outside the US were illegal.

1917 2018-07-18 20:04:55 Also have you seen the debt since 2010. The debt is bigger than all other governments added together. Tories are snake oil salesman
1918 2018-07-18 20:04:54 Lol ladies please note that I'm also starting out hence I try more than 1 brand.. But so far so good ..

1920 2018-07-18 20:04:43 Thx Vet says it was probably motor oil and that he checks out spared from antifreeze
1921 2018-07-18 20:04:31 Made my own herb oil lol
1922 2018-07-18 20:04:27 I’ve been scared to eat @ChickfilA my whole life cause if my peanut allergy but I just found out the peanut oil they use is so pure it doesn’t have allergens in it? Anyone know if that’s true?
1923 2018-07-18 20:04:26 The best law ever. In their countries they enjoy peace hd it not bn western interference in need of their oil thru tryin to influence their governance. No thievin, no adultery, no druggin, no prostitution,
1924 2018-07-18 20:04:19 Yeah of course, like wages are just super fucking low thanks to NAFTA, U.S. corporations are contaminating the environment in Mexico and basically destroyed national industries in here, oh and Hillary Clinton just pushed to privatize our state oil company.

1928 2018-07-18 20:04:08 You may want to spread out the shredded taters on a baking sheet & salt/towel again to let them dry out before making the cakes. The last time I tried making latkes, I didn't do that step; I had some adhesion issues (& hot oil spitting)!
1929 2018-07-18 20:04:06 Smashed my phone and poured some hot cooking oil on my arms. Brilliant day
1930 2018-07-18 20:04:02 (I know a lot of people see her as a lesbian but...)

(She warms up to Shuichi, so why can’t she with others eventually?)
1931 2018-07-18 20:04:00 we need leaders that champion the environment, support public health thru food, and take on the AG and oil industries if wE want to save our kids and our home FUCKKKKKKKKKKKK
1932 2018-07-18 20:03:53 Put oil? chfaf
1933 2018-07-18 20:03:47 Did you espouse to them that you didn't care about poor people, only the rich, especially oil barons and polluters.
1934 2018-07-18 20:03:44 Remember the Gulf oil spill and how long it burned. 40% of the Gulf was contaminated. it took a long time for obama to respond, he partied every night, took photo shoots daily. Nero fiddled while Rome burned.
1935 2018-07-18 20:03:38 ||

Oh god he answered.
She looked.

...

No response.

*...Im just scared ok?
1936 2018-07-18 20:03:37 - I then use either the @PurpulHair leave in conditioner or aunt Jackie's.
- To seal the moisture it's either I use this jaimacan hair food or shear butter from purpul hair.
- Then I finish off by either the purpul hair oil or Jamaican castor oil.
1937 2018-07-18 20:03:35 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)

1941 2018-07-18 20:03:13 Nice to have a BCer in this portfolio. Come to the west coast & meet with people in your new role. There are many issues to discuss, including the respective roles of @CoastGuardCAN & @MarineResponse re marine oil spill response. @Transport_gc @cathmckenna #OceansProtectionPlan
1942 2018-07-18 20:03:11 I just want some decent tempo...give me some vol. You can’t find some anywhere besides oil
1943 2018-07-18 20:03:08 //I ALWAYS WATCHED THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNG
1944 2018-07-18 20:02:59 Restructuring alone will not magically boost state revenues. have a look at how much the south-south states have received in oil money over the years...and they have built...what?
1945 2018-07-18 20:02:55 Well, if Batboy starts weeping olive oil, sure!
1946 2018-07-18 20:02:43 Where did you get the Jamaican castor oil?
1947 2018-07-18 20:02:37 I feels good being a dog ass nigga UNTIL you run across a dog ass female .. that shit like oil & water , but hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
1948 2018-07-18 20:02:24 i can’t walk on the beach w/o getting tar stuck to the bottom of my feet it doesn’t come off for days even with water & soap. we literally have to buy tar wipes for our skin bc of the oil rigs...this is from walking in the sand...can u imagine how marine life is being affected
1949 2018-07-18 20:02:17 For real? Rising cost of money (inflation) triggers multiple contraction. 

Standard Oil type break up forced by the state at some point down the line.

$COST going on the internet offering truly the lowest prices!!!
1950 2018-07-18 20:02:09 YOU could deny Trump's Supreme Court pick and regain a lot of your lost respect!
Besides being the one to reverse Roe V Wade,he has been going to the polluters,gas and oil and coal and all the corporations with his hand out,he is in the bag for them!
1951 2018-07-18 20:02:04 Was AT&T broken up for being successful? Standard Oil? No, they were broken up for being monopolies and misusing their pricing power. The US govt is now owned by large corporations. The EU isn't. It doesn't punish success. It regulates competition across the EU.
1952 2018-07-18 20:01:50 This reminds me of Trump's, "This time well keep the oil" sound byte, which he unbelievably kept repeating. Incredibly ignorant, but one major difference. One is somewhere in Sticksville USA. One is in the White House. Trump and his administration have to be removed from power.
1953 2018-07-18 20:01:48 Go to trading view and pull up a weekly chart of Oil. Obviously, we tanked Oil and fuel prices over an 18 month period (starting early in 2014) in retaliation to Ukraine/Crimea. That's why Putin hates Obama and HRC. We crippled the Russian economy. It's obvious.
1954 2018-07-18 20:01:37 Did Tommy work on the docks????

1970 2018-07-18 20:00:21 That midnight oil is pretty scarce. They must have literally pulled out all the stops and turned over every stone. I hope it wasn’t a literal witch hunt, though. Someone could get turned into an actual newt.
1971 2018-07-18 20:00:18 @Cartmansperiscope I think partially their largely unhedged exposure to oil as well

1979 2018-07-18 19:58:58 This may be the catalyst for a lot of UK companies that are just getting going in many different areas to have some support , I believe going fwd the UK will need to have independence with oil & gas well done everyone.

1993 2018-07-18 19:57:49 Are you on shatter? Tracks are already being lifted because there's no business case for them anymore. Sending oil by pipeline is faster, cheaper, and much safer than sending it by rail.

I realize all of this, and I like trains and would prefer to travel by them.

1995 2018-07-18 19:57:40 @MSNBC @CNBC PLEASE stop talking about oil prices. Burning fossil fuels is hurting our climate. OUR ENTIRE PLANET needs to move away from oil, natural gas and coal.
1996 2018-07-18 19:57:34 There’s this oil my mom had that helped get rid of wrinkles and also stretch marks. When she gets home I’ll ask her what it’s called!

1998 2018-07-18 19:57:28 There was virtually no gold going to Europe from what is modern day Nigeria (where I am from). The trade here was for enslaved people, and later, palm oil, which was an Industrial input.

2007 2018-07-18 19:56:18 #MandelaDay Really is that invaders conquering the white skin of Euro and Britain occupied his country and looted their wealth of gold and oil. They occupy the leadership positions, as do the imperialist West in the Third World. Are the people of these countries ashamed or proud
2008 2018-07-18 19:56:17 2/2 And the rest needs to stop being gullible idiots fighting for the USA's imperialistic foreign policy to benefit special interests (oil, military spending) That "we" got suckered by US warmongers is not Trump's problem. It's ours.
2009 2018-07-18 19:56:11 I assume these puns will be coded, disseminated and made fully interoperable with other land, oil, mining, ag and hydro-based puns across the remainder of the #OGPgeorgia agenda and subsequent report-outs. #OGP2018

2011 2018-07-18 19:55:46 20% Isn't much, France has about 28% public sector jobs, they communist now? Their failing was relying too much on their oil and not implementing many social programs, when oil fell inflation hit and people couldn't pay the rents anymore(& more nuance), not because of COMMUNISM.
2012 2018-07-18 19:55:45 til when you have stuff to do, having one of the things being an oil change is a pretty bad idea. ive been here for almost two hours now

2015 2018-07-18 19:55:33 Feeling happy about the foundation at first & then my oil starts peaking through
2016 2018-07-18 19:55:30 the times are gone, that it was possible to make good money by oil. Please understand it.
2017 2018-07-18 19:55:20 Odessa, TX (where this occurred at a Saltgrass steakhouse) is a backwater oil town 350 miles from Dallas... Stuck in 1950... inexcusable. @SaltgrassSteak - how can you allow this to happen to your employees?
2018 2018-07-18 19:55:17 i hate when recipes call for “good” olive oil or “good” vanilla..... i’m sorry ina i love you but when i can afford to have that on hand regularly i’ll let u know!
2019 2018-07-18 19:55:17 The drilling of Oil must STOP nOW! The Nations need to rely on the Sun for its energy. Mans Souls are in danger. Go Solar or the Consequence will be destruction

2021 2018-07-18 19:55:05 Also, Alberta got into the massive economic mess they are in from being over reliant on oil and economic mismanagement by the Conservative PC govt for 45 years.

2024 2018-07-18 19:54:38 @realDonaldTrump Indeed, this diet is the worst diet on earth, which one can live and survive with all this pressure. If the United States really wants to support the Iranian people, do not allow this regime to sell its oil

2027 2018-07-18 19:54:11 Same way a car engine does. A lot of heat oil and grease. I asked them if they weren't going to help why didn't they at least get the marshmallows
2028 2018-07-18 19:54:06 I mean, how you be attracted to something so different from you? Forcing their ideologies (which they think is right) on others eew!! The apocalypse is here, I'm beginning 6 shots of olive oil every four-hour for cleansing.
2029 2018-07-18 19:53:58 There were 14g of fats in the coconut oil I used. Plus fats in the ground beef.
2030 2018-07-18 19:53:47 Ooo it does look like that!

I used UV-reactive acrylic paint, along with a black light. I mix in a few ingredients, including silicone oil to create those little "cells" that form cool patterns. You can use regular acrylic paint for non-glowy versions (see my Twitter banner).
2031 2018-07-18 19:53:47 Ron are you getting into the oil business with the Russians?
2032 2018-07-18 19:53:18 @realDonaldTrump Russia has only plundered our country and has done nothing positive, our people never like Russia. My only criterion is the full implementation of sanctions, in particular the sanctions on oil, oil and oil
2033 2018-07-18 19:53:16 //There probably are.
2034 2018-07-18 19:53:11 These 2 white ppl in here where I'm getting my oil change are talking about NRA banquets.

2036 2018-07-18 19:53:00 my mans knows i ran out of CBD oil & have been having trouble sleeping so he massaged my scalp until i passed out & then woke me up by going down on me & giving me a back massage. here’s your reminder to never fucking settle bc there are people that will give you what you deserve
2037 2018-07-18 19:53:00 It’s kinda like a vape but has cannabis oil
2038 2018-07-18 19:52:50 Because, oil and water don’t mix!
2039 2018-07-18 19:52:45 Here's the correct CPI... People filing for unemployment is up compared to the last 2 months.

Energy commodity 24.3%
Fuel oil 30.8%
Gasoline 24.3%
Car insurance 7.6%

2045 2018-07-18 19:52:00 Here's my weird thought of the day. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to get to completely submerge yourself from the neck down in a tub full of body lotion? Not lotion mixed in with water or oil or mud but like off the rack moisturizing cream

2049 2018-07-18 19:51:22 Ah, man. I’m so sorry to hear that! Serenity should definitely help. 

There’s an oil blend that you can apply topically (I usually put it on the soles of my feet before bed) and they also have it in pill form now, which is AWESOME!
2050 2018-07-18 19:51:13 Just finished meeting with @corybergh & some of the leaders at NAL Resources again. Inspired by their work around digital transformation with @DeloitteCanada + others. A great case study around digital transformation + innovation in Oil & Gas. Glad to be part of this journey!!

2052 2018-07-18 19:51:01 Oh and MPL and I've just started using their Jamaican black castor oil and I'll see if it does any good to my hair.

I use sunlight green bar soap to wash my hair and extract the aloe gel and use it for moisture too.
2053 2018-07-18 19:51:01 I was going to crack an oil change joke, thought better of it
2054 2018-07-18 19:51:00 I also want to know what the SAFE number for CO2 is ? If CO2 is the main culprit for our problems , someone somewhere in the scientific community can SURELY tell me what the safe number is ?? At least then we have a target ! Right now we have a pump attached to oil money is all !

2072 2018-07-18 19:49:08 So if I follow the Left’s logic... the Russians planted a sleeper who got elected President, grew our economy, strengthened our military/NATO, secured our border, and increased oil production?

Great plan.

2077 2018-07-18 19:48:52 Babe I'm very cheap net so what I use is Jamican Black castor oil, the normal castor oil, amla oil and the conditioner from the same brand which is Mera.

I base my scalp with coconut oil, I don't apply it directly to my hair. I also use Soft and free moisturizer.

2083 2018-07-18 19:48:01 What is outrageous, was your behavior wrt to Libya. We're still dealing with the refugee flows, too.

Also, let's level - you are/were a member of the David Rockefeller (Standard Oil - ExxonMobil, Chevron, Conoco Philips, Amoco - and JPMorgan Chase) founded Trilateral Commission.
2084 2018-07-18 19:48:01 I participate in the company Barrel, the results are satisfied, the payouts come very quickly, I recommend investors not to pass by, the company is official and has a serious status, working in such a field as oil products.
2085 2018-07-18 19:47:59 I hear you, but the technology is getting there - imagine if we as a country invested more in better ways of living to save our planet. I’d rather look at windmills than oil rigs or fracking drills...just me though.

2134 2018-07-18 19:42:48 They sure are. Although ironically, in the long run I suspect they'll end up doing no better out of the chaos they're stoking than the United States will; it won't change the fact that their economy is pretty much hopelessly screwed (not least because they're too reliant on oil.)
2135 2018-07-18 19:42:47 The truth is that invaders conquering the white skin of Europe and Britain occupied his country and looted their wealth of gold and oil.

2205 2018-07-18 19:32:02 Trump is right liberals. His policies on Russia have been the toughest since the Cold War. If he gets Germany to stop the pipeline from Russia, and get their oil and natural gas from the US , he will have taken all Of Putin’s power over Europe away. Obama gave him everything.
2206 2018-07-18 19:31:58 To totally absolve them of their actions because neither is president is justifying those actions.  When you provide proof, then I'll start taking you serious.  You are more a Kremlin asset than Trump.  Not sure many assets would criticize an ally for buying oil from the Russians
2207 2018-07-18 19:31:57 Neither do convention centers.  The difference? Tourism dollars, tax dollars, jobs, etc.  But, I'm glad Karen can still book her yoga class to sell snake oil products at JUMP.  Again, props to Idaho Falls - of all places - for taking the lead on something sorely needed in Idaho
2208 2018-07-18 19:31:54 I just... I've never seen as clear an obvious of a snake oil salesman. but people are falling for it. and as more and more evidence comes out it only seems to fortify their belief. its wild. I can't even pretend to be shocked anymore.

2210 2018-07-18 19:31:27 So they *might* be able to reach what was previously a target intended to restrict output. Well, that certainly looks promising for future oil supply...
2211 2018-07-18 19:31:26 Harper's strategy - marginalizing people concerned about climate change ("eco-terrorists") - failed. I think Trudeau and Notley's strategy - use carbon pricing to cut Canadian emissions *and* continue to export oil - is a better one.
2212 2018-07-18 19:31:25 In them there olden days you had the old Snake Oil salesman, fast forward and the clothes have changed and the mode of transport  but the selling speel is the same. This guy would see no ethical problem in pyramid selling or come to that sell The Pyramids.

2216 2018-07-18 19:30:26 I bet imported oil is much cheaper (also making up for low imports last week due to 4th of july).  Also, either China was trying to absorb as much oil as possible before the trade war got worse or the Venezuela situation distorted exports in June.

2229 2018-07-18 19:28:39 The Canadian oil sands are simply too large to stay out of the spotlight. As climate change continues to get worse, the oil sands will be blamed for it. This is a problem we need to solve - again, for self-interested reasons.

2243 2018-07-18 19:25:50 My argument about Canadian self-interest isn't based on greater moral commitment at all. It's based on recognition that people tend to blame *oil companies* for climate change - in other words, they're attributing the emissions from burning oil to the *producer*, i.e. us.
2244 2018-07-18 19:25:44 Yeah....seriously....put pepper on your burgers and fries...Chewing up peppercorns or drinking pepper oil sounds like it would cause me more anxiety then it would cure. I would have to smoke a bowl just to get the taste outta my mouth! LMFAO!

Rebel-without-a-cause Alfonso mind-travels back in time to Earth's demise. Damn, his world’s going down the same path! Now rebel-WITH-a-cause, he tackles Big Oil to save the future.

2313 2018-07-18 19:18:20 As the Drive-By’s lose their minds over Russia consider: Pres. Trump has been much tougher on Russia than Obama:
• Bombed Russian ally Syria
• Expanded Oil & Gas production, drove prices down & crippled the Russian Economy 
• Increased Sanctions 
• Ramped up Military Spending

2317 2018-07-18 19:17:21 EDT is cheaper coz its not oil based while EDP is a bit more expensive coz its oil based which means its longer lasting. I didn't know this ngisizwe ukusebenza in the fragrance department
2318 2018-07-18 19:17:15 Like I said, it won't convince everyone. But it's a far better argument than "we're too small to matter." We have the world's third-largest oil reserves; we need a better answer than that.

2322 2018-07-18 19:16:50 “Barriers to growth” means eleminating laws that keep oil workers safe, but puts more money in the executives pockets. That third yacht won’t buy itself!

2325 2018-07-18 19:16:38 But our PM says, do you need a lucky PM or unlucky one. On the topic of low cost of oil in international market.

I dont think they really undsrstand, how MMS has sailed us through out whole world economic slow down, without let us know the situation outside india.
2326 2018-07-18 19:16:37 And the U.S. sells oil to other countries. 

Doesn't mean we don't also import a lot of oil.
2327 2018-07-18 19:16:32 It all started with Bale being sold for £90+m to RM. That was the oil to the ever growing . Other clubs are latching onto the concept of over pricing a player, knowing the buying club will pay it. But in a small twist, if the price is £66m, then that’s Salah & Alisson for £100m
2328 2018-07-18 19:16:25 I use smoked tofu fried in the pan with some oil as a “bacon” substitute. Also works well as bacon bits. I’m really turned off by vegan food that’s too close to meat.
2329 2018-07-18 19:16:21 The most probable explanation is that someone is putting oil on the statue.

2339 2018-07-18 19:14:46 @MarcLobliner only 1 mts fish oil capsule per day as instructed on the pack ? I feel like you’ve said to take more than that in the past?

2360 2018-07-18 19:12:40 They think peppermint oil smells bad. One student asked if I wash my hair every day which I don’t but I had literally washed my hair that night and did an oils treatment. Lmbo it’s not okay but my friend works are another school and her students do the same andbthe Asian teacher
2361 2018-07-18 19:12:37 This is a very undefined analysis. I see why you're confused. Industries, the ones that support this big cities and allow them to survive, such as Ag, oil and gas, mining, ranching, etc. (You know, the creation of what you need to survive) share costs with fed govt.

2389 2018-07-18 19:10:02 CBD is a compound found in cannabis and hemp. THC can also be found in cannabis and it’s this compound that gives marijuana its psychoactive properties. CBD oils for pets come from hemp without the THC. In short, your pet won’t get “high” from CBD oil.

2414 2018-07-18 19:07:29 He is undoubtedly in Putin’s pocket.  Russia has two thinks that project power in the world, outdated military, and huge oil reserves.

2417 2018-07-18 19:06:50 Creating a ministry for border security sounds like good long-term risk management when we have an adversary who wants northern access to the arctic for oil drilling and an ally-turned-adversary to the south who is already accosting our maritime fishermen in Cdn waters.

2437 2018-07-18 19:04:14 You have nearly six thousand followers and your bio lists your interests as oil, narcotics and human rights, how are people not CONSTANTLY SHOUTING AT YOU
2438 2018-07-18 19:04:06 I'm so glad you are promoting this product. I buy HempWorx CBD oil from hemp. I give it to my dog for seizures, and my husband and I take it for our BP. It was easier to purchase the oil made from hemp, than pot from collectives, when the law went into effect on the 1st. in CA.
2439 2018-07-18 19:04:01 All oil is not the same, there is a reason some oil producing nations both buy and sell abroad

That said I am absolutely in favor of increased energy independence 

Increasing and modernizing our refinement infrastructure should be a priority
2440 2018-07-18 19:03:51 I still call him a snake oil salesman
2441 2018-07-18 19:03:42 Tried it. Vaseline too. Powder. Oil. Bio oil. But in the cold season they are uncontrollable. Today was too cold for them.
2442 2018-07-18 19:03:35 Coconut oil.
Yes, the one you can use for cooking.
2443 2018-07-18 19:03:35 The price of an oil change at Walmart is the same as buying 5 quarts and a filter......... Lol
2444 2018-07-18 19:03:34 Others include:
Do you keep your neck hair at the Adams Apple?
Do you fold your sleeves?
Did you know how to use olive oil and avocados?
Do you now wear skinnier pants?
2445 2018-07-18 19:03:30 Just remember to start off with 1tsp MCT oil at first. Too much and you’ll be running to the toilet.
2446 2018-07-18 19:03:25 why is this oil meme going around

2448 2018-07-18 19:02:53 My favorite thing about tv show funerals is their firm belief that everyone has a 3'x4' framed oil portrait of themselves ready and on hand, no matter how unexpected the death

  Not transparent at all. The go- to guy for realistic unbiased technical assessments.
2451 2018-07-18 19:02:44 If you’re looking for a good one try the Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer! Have been using this for like three years it’s amazing  It’s a heat protectant too and it doesn’t make my hair greasy.
2452 2018-07-18 19:02:37 At the same time I know working class people with no theoretical background who have always had an accurate analysis of current events, even if it was in a kind of layman’s shorthand. When some says “we’re in Iraq for oil”, they may be oversimplifying, but also correct
2453 2018-07-18 19:02:33 Getting paid to do it  yay oil field
2454 2018-07-18 19:02:28 always a bit surprising but it turns out oil prices often have an outsized impact on real wage growth ...
2455 2018-07-18 19:02:21 those boobs look like they need some baby oil to help with moisturising them. I am happy to help with that if needed ;) xx (if not , can i watch ? ) x
2456 2018-07-18 19:02:12 Thanks for all your help finding a green alternative to engery in Alberta . That $135 rebate check really makes me feel good about the 1.35 per litre I pay in an oil rich province.
2457 2018-07-18 19:02:10 Looking at mirror every 5minutes cause I just used Coconut oil 
2458 2018-07-18 19:02:04 Too much oil field money gonna be pullin up.. y’all be careful
2459 2018-07-18 19:01:32 Fuel/oil mix is good. 
2460 2018-07-18 19:01:26 Yeah, I saw that in the shop. It’s not the organic or virgin so I just took a different one that’s a cold pressed virgin coconut oil. Has an odour but is amazing.

2462 2018-07-18 19:01:17 Retenciones al agro, algunos países africanos, y cada vez menos.
Pero si te va bien con el trigo, pagás ganancias, ingresos brutos, y ya pagaste IVA, impuesto al gas oil, inmobiliario si tenés campo, sellos si alquilás.
2463 2018-07-18 19:01:14 I haven’t used the oil directly. Just vape pens and I smoke the hell out of them and I feel absolutely fine lol.
2464 2018-07-18 19:01:03 cooking naked is all sexy, fun and games until the oil pops onto your nipple.
2465 2018-07-18 19:00:57 In the motion for pretrial detention they mention Butina's connections to oligarchs and specifically said one who is in Forbes real time 2018 list as 1.2 billion. There were 10 or 11 Russian men that met the criteria but he was only one tied to Alfa and oil.
2466 2018-07-18 19:00:46 i need a oil change 
2467 2018-07-18 19:00:32 So, instead of maybe some assistance on this messed up rock, we'll make do, with a little oil on a statue, this should start making a difference any time now...

2472 2018-07-18 19:00:13 That's because it's true. Not all land is made equal and some will never produce "enough" crops for consumption. Issue is when humans convert forests to grazing land and palm oil farms because the market demands more for cheaper.
2473 2018-07-18 19:00:12 but it evens out when i don't change my oil, put brakes on my car, fix broken things, cut grass, kill bugs, lift anything heavy. he treats me like a queen & in turn i treat him like a king. symbiosis at it's finest.
2474 2018-07-18 19:00:02 I always like to keep a tally of how many men come up and offer help/ask me if I’m okay when I’m putting oil in my car. 

Today’s count: 3 old men within the span of 15 minutes :-) 

Thanks for the concern guys, but I’m doing okay lol

2477 2018-07-18 18:59:41 Now you are resorting to the same bigoted, insult tactics that the @CPC_HQ use all because Quebec and Atlantic Canada won't vote for their reformacon party.

2502 2018-07-18 18:55:36 Having used coconut oil and ghee for centuries, people in India were coaxed to ditch them in the 1970s. My grandparents would be laughing at us from heaven. I have to find ways to avoid this discussion with my mother!

To couch this as being about "local weatherman" is wrong.

2523 2018-07-18 18:53:12 I hate getting my oil changed because the mechanics always talk down to me. Just because I don’t know a ton about cars doesn’t mean you get to make fun of me, a paying customer, when I ask for more information or for you to repeat yourself.

2577 2018-07-18 18:47:08 The $oil price will go to $100 because there is not enough new investment and production, so why are oil service stocks sold down, they will get better earnings.
2578 2018-07-18 18:47:01 THEY WORKED HARD! Now have a good life. GOOD FOR THEM!! People from around the world come here. IF it is so bad here! WHY? Can they not change there own Countries? OR is true freedom just for America? When you really want freedom. Move to a MUSLIM NATION. DRINK IN THE OIL,
2579 2018-07-18 18:46:58 Love covers, we are the Olive Tree, let our righteous branches drip fresh oil on all religious and rebellious flesh.

2581 2018-07-18 18:46:40 Competitive advantage is when you harnessed your resources to be ahead of the business  packed. Pointing a finger at Google  for dominance is like suggesting to France there need to be a second scramble of francophone Africa ,because u can't access oil that easily
2582 2018-07-18 18:46:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2583 2018-07-18 18:46:33 Who gains the most, i would still submit it's the United States/Israeli partnership. Most military bases worldwide, most oil pipelines belong to the United States. Israel only benefits if the United States intervenes, you remember that. Israel on its own cannot.
2584 2018-07-18 18:46:32 Brought my sisters car to get an oil change and he said he had to do all these things to it and I was just like....uhhhh okay? Lol it’s free so okay
2585 2018-07-18 18:46:29 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
2586 2018-07-18 18:46:16 Maybe this will finally get the Saudi royals to back off a ways in Yemen.  Saudi Arabia's oil refineries are vulnerable to airstrikes and they don't have the same level of fire fighting capabilities US refineries have.

2589 2018-07-18 18:46:11 All those things are heavily reported on...

The head of NATO has said as much re: increased spending and credits Trump. We've sent arms to Ukraine when Obama didn't.  Opposed Russia in Syria killing a few hundred Russia hired troops. We're actively damaging their oil industry
2590 2018-07-18 18:46:06 He'd have an ice pack in his hand.

2595 2018-07-18 18:45:17 Everyone saying that Trump shouldn't be trusted is like working on an oil rig next to 5000°f vats and using your line manager to stir.
2596 2018-07-18 18:45:17 You can't compare oil with the rare minerals mined in SA...only the rich few buy diamonds, gold etc...oil is used everyday,that is why the middle east is so rich
2597 2018-07-18 18:45:10 I saw the thing o.. egg of 200 naira  I will pour him hot oil that I wanted to fry the eggs with..
2598 2018-07-18 18:45:04 Exactly, if she had to publish that letter with her address, email and phone number, why does she have to send it to the #PMModi . No wonder why #AadharCard is linked to everything. "Data" is the new "Oil" in this age. Privacy breach is a serious concern. @IronyOfIndia_
2599 2018-07-18 18:45:00 GOVERNMENT says fuel levies are not going anywhere and South Africans have to accept that the price of crude oil is determined in the international market.

The month of July has seen fuel prices hit record highs in the country, reaching the R16 a litre mark for the first time.

2603 2018-07-18 18:44:50 American wars are rarely the noble fights for liberty we think they are. Mostly, they are corporate mandated conquests to secure oil fields or fill the pockets of arms industry executives. Recently both.
2604 2018-07-18 18:44:43 Having my car in the garage today has made me even more confused than ever. The diagnostic computer found no faults. My brake and clutch fluid is disappearing somewhere, but there are no holes in my cables or containers, and there is no leak or drain into the engine oil.
2605 2018-07-18 18:44:34 “Do you know that CBD OIL is capable of reducing fear and anxiety and panic response to stress?” Like and I'll invite

2606 2018-07-18 18:44:27 Texas is now the third biggest oil producer in the world behind Iraq and Iran . I can tell you it’s because of President Trump.  Getting rid of restrictive regulations imposed during the Obama administration
2607 2018-07-18 18:44:27 Solar is next.
Oil depleted.
2608 2018-07-18 18:44:18 Regular selling at $3.89 per gallon in DC

Prices rise when OPEC decides to curb its oil production and when presidents pull out of nuclear deals. And now he wants to start selling our reserves

#StableGenius
2609 2018-07-18 18:44:10 Shouldn't the CTF be pushing to have the carbon tax revenue used to reduce income taxes?

Canada has a self-interested reason to pursue carbon pricing: without a credible plan on climate change, the oil sands are being targeted as a scapegoat. That affects economic growth.

2613 2018-07-18 18:43:37 Thanks Stephen - I don’t think #fracking is the cause (could be a big issue further down the line), but UKOG were extracting oil at Horse Hill and Angus have a live injection well nearby too.

These both need looking into

Do you think they could be connected to numerous tremors?
2614 2018-07-18 18:43:35 called for empty coal train. i hope i see the day when i am no longer running coal trains. or ethanol trains. or oil trains. or sand trains...

But I didn't OD or anything weird. I was kinda anxious though, which is odd for me, but I remembered pepper.

2711 2018-07-18 18:33:26 @Gidi_Traffic @MBuhari @AkinwunmiAmbode Is it that nothing right can be done in this country?. No road anywhere. Trucks and oil Tankers every where. This is how we want to spend/loot away with over 200billion nxt year. @AkinwunmiAmbode just come out for president abeg.
2712 2018-07-18 18:33:07 God: “I should do something to give the humans hope!”

God: “Olive oil! Have the priest put olive oil on a statue!”

Angel: “Oh, sure. That’s helpful. Fuck! I need another job.”
2713 2018-07-18 18:33:03 @canada4shariah I believe oil prices should be consistent and stable for all trading.$70-$75 would be super. Services Companies are finally charging reasonable amounts so Oil can be profitable as low as $55

2717 2018-07-18 18:32:35 I just spent 30 minutes cleaning up the baby oil I spilled, only to turn around and spill olive oil all over my kitchen counter 2 minutes afterwards. so my life is going great
2718 2018-07-18 18:32:33 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
2719 2018-07-18 18:32:27 If you are concerned about future generations, consider these things.
If we neglect our infrastructure now, who will pay for the collapsed bridge later? (with lives and real resources)
If we ignore alternative energy now, who will be SOL when we run out of oil later?
Real costs.
2720 2018-07-18 18:32:18 Literally everything he cooks has lashings of olive oil, handfuls of salt and a big lump of cheese...
2721 2018-07-18 18:32:09 Something I’ve been curious about for a long time, but too lazy to google. How much crude oil = 1oz of plastic. Anyone know anything about #plastic and #oil?
2722 2018-07-18 18:32:01 Business and corporations are exempt from hose pipe bans but joe public is not and will apply whatever bans become necessaryand this to my mind with oil and gas abusing the earth's water supplies only to render them useless is criminal and blatantly unfair

2727 2018-07-18 18:31:32 Just realized now, you asked me about polenta;).. in general I prefer it very thin, but I improved the cooking method on the grill. You can leave a little bit thicker, but you need to put some oil on the grill and wait until you get the crust..then it’s amazing with the meat;)
2728 2018-07-18 18:31:31 Gotta get my oil change before work 
2729 2018-07-18 18:31:31 @Wendys are your fries currently not gluten free only because of the cooking process by sharing the frying oil with other non-GF foods (cross contamination) or are there actually gluten containing ingredients in the fries? Thanks

2733 2018-07-18 18:31:24 I do too but we overdo the oil sometimes.

2760 2018-07-18 18:28:47 Trump is a clown. A puppit on a string. Same goes for Obama and all US presidents before them.

2845 2018-07-18 18:20:40 To my "Friend" from Maine, DirtyWood, DirtyCoal & DirtyRefuse Generated, was more than the 3 largest Maine cleancombined cycle PowerPlants combined.

2850 2018-07-18 18:20:16 Sounds like wage growth is not quite keeping up with inflation. That 0.2% difference is significant. Ryan isn't as smart as ppl make him out to be. He's a snake oil salesman. Also, rising is premiums and energy costs will more than offset any wage gains.
2851 2018-07-18 18:20:11 Cultivating assets for years (decades) and training spies to extreme levels is how Russia preserves their position of power in the world. They have nothing but oil & gas; their nuclear weapons & bully tactics keep it on top of world stage unlike China, it has nukes, tech & money.
2852 2018-07-18 18:19:58 Just grilled some halloumi, toasted some tomatoes with a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper and paprika
2853 2018-07-18 18:19:52 Really, what nonsense. I said you were a scholar, after all you worked out that oil equals money. That's not bad going for someone not too bright.
2854 2018-07-18 18:19:49 Note to self : less is more with coconut oil i got some fright
2855 2018-07-18 18:19:21 You should work like a professional. When things are going down you are again putting oil to fire. Delete this, action is already taken against this threat...!
2856 2018-07-18 18:19:18 Only thing of value russer has to trade is oil

2861 2018-07-18 18:18:41 My car has been having a few mysterious issues, and I’m in the waiting room while they change my oil and do a basic check. I feel like I’m waiting for a doctor to tell me bad news
2862 2018-07-18 18:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2863 2018-07-18 18:18:38 Maybe they earn on oil...

2873 2018-07-18 18:18:12 People had way too much Hilary in their eye to fully comprehend the used car/snake oil/sham wow BS coming out of candidate Chump's mouth during the campaign.
Not sure they've fully removed it either. For pride sake they can't.
2874 2018-07-18 18:18:04 I use biore charcoal face wash and equate oil free moisturizer. It keeps any kind of breakouts at bay for the most part for me. But if I happen to get a bump or two, I just started using these St. Ives green tea  exfoliant that helps clear it up
2875 2018-07-18 18:17:44 this girl is avocado and tofu mixed with garlic lime juice oil salt
2876 2018-07-18 18:17:34 An oil change should not take an hour and a half.  I’m lookin at you @subaru_usa
2877 2018-07-18 18:17:27 A lot has changed since 2011. In 2011, US was just about getting started with shale oil and gas.

2896 2018-07-18 18:15:11 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
2897 2018-07-18 18:15:10 You add it to the water before it starts to boil. The pasta will then absorb some of the flavor. It's also important to stir the pasta often so the oil, salt, ect. doesn't just float above the pasta.

2904 2018-07-18 18:14:54 There is nothing worse than the KSA. The US no longer needs their oil so they should act accordingly. Let them and Iran kick off and that will keep both too busy to bother the West,

So you're now OK with oil, as well as oil pipelines, just not exported oil. And you're OK with anti-oil protesters operating gas stations. And you're OK with tankers in the St Lawrence or US tankers on our coast, just not ours
2910 2018-07-18 18:14:31 About coconut oil. I was watching queer eye and Jonathan was making diy exfoliant with it. Would that still clog your pores or since you're washing it off you'll be fine

2912 2018-07-18 18:14:22 Dram number 1 @TheGlenAllachie 10yo CS.
Rich on the nose. 1st I’m getting oak, vanilla, green apples and a hint of olive oil. Then it’s getting more vegetal/herbaceous. Nose changes very quickly. Probably because of the temperature (27°C right now). #GlenAllachieWhisky
2913 2018-07-18 18:14:22 If I'd not run out of characters I'd have mentioned that as well!

I think it was Antonio Carluccio who in an interview said that when he came to England he had to buy olive oil from Boots because English couldn't think of anything to do with it other than stick it in their ears.
2914 2018-07-18 18:14:19 Weren't you the one that pissed all over Germany for having an oil deal with Russia???

2924 2018-07-18 18:13:46 Yes and oil equals money
2925 2018-07-18 18:13:45 No, as they need to refine oil and don't have a proper storage network to survive on.

2934 2018-07-18 18:13:09 Hi, professional cook here. Always put salt into your water if you're cooking something. It helps the flavor. Same with adding olive oil.
2935 2018-07-18 18:13:06 I'm getting an oil change at my dealership and they got Coco playing in the waiting room and I swear to God it should be a crime to show this movie in any waiting room. Making everyone look like a bitch

2937 2018-07-18 18:13:06 Yes it is, that's because it has oil. If it had no oil It would just be another desert
2938 2018-07-18 18:13:01 What Arab states has the US colonized?
OPEC nations - set oil prices world wide - lets not talk about how exploited they are. 
With a few exceptions, the vast amount of war in the Middle East has been infighting.

2949 2018-07-18 18:12:08 And you know what they do with all that oil? They export it. MAGA.
2950 2018-07-18 18:12:07 According to the International Energy Agency, Nigeria produced about 2.53 million barrels (402,000 m3) per day, well below its oil production capacity of over 3 million barrels (480,000 m3) per day, in 2011. Nigeria is an important oil supplier to the United States.

There are lots of dry oils that don’t feel bad.

2983 2018-07-18 18:08:19 I agree went out on the oil tanker and it was fantastic
2984 2018-07-18 18:08:14 You need to read a book. Gadaffi nationalized the oil supply and spread the wealth to the citizens of Libya. Graduate college, get a free car. Get married, get a free house. Free healthcare too.

Ironic that democrats murdered the only successful socialist leader on the planet.
2985 2018-07-18 18:08:10 Hey thanks!  we will be back Saturday to get our niece’s truck aligned n stuff & possibly today to get our monthly full synthetic oil change! (Yes, we drive a lot ) Have an awesome rest of your week!

2995 2018-07-18 18:07:24 What really alarms me is the near vertical growth forecast for personal income tax revenue. And seriously $60 oil in 10 years?!  Likely much higher. We pay how many millions for a junk 10 yr forecast. Please win the election @PierrePoilievre
2996 2018-07-18 18:07:22 My dog is crying in the jiffy lube waiting room bc he thinks we’re at the vet and I can’t even call him stupid bc when they asked me what kind of oil I wanted I was like do you have extra virgin?
2997 2018-07-18 18:07:20 As a part of his fan base, I do get offended when ppl attack him. Not bc it's him but bc he is the most effective human Ive seen at propelling us in to a sustainable future. I take it personally but it is quite literally my child's future. Oil is finite, yet Im the crazy one?
2998 2018-07-18 18:07:18 Is Montenegro devoid of oil? 
Does 45 just not like countries whose leader was nearly assassinated by Russia?
Does 45 still misunderstand the concept of "deterrent" esp when one country is solidly in a pact with many others vs one often the aggressor?
2999 2018-07-18 18:07:16 Funny a bunch of oil companies are packing up and leaving Eagle Ford Shale
3000 2018-07-18 18:07:10 I can’t live in Oklahoma .. I’m moving to Miami where you (Russ) have no job and no job prospects in the oil business.  

That’s called forcing Russ to decide:  live with her or live without her.
3001 2018-07-18 18:06:58 My spirit kept telling me to take “oil of oregano” and my hard headed ass didn’t. But I did today and boy I’m happy af
3002 2018-07-18 18:06:34 It’s always amazing how those who lack credibility desperately seek the public forum to remain relevant. Comey taking notes from snake oil peddlers who relabeled their product as they moved from town to town. Historically, charlatans don’t fare well.

3005 2018-07-18 18:06:18 More Trump lies, just this week, part 4. Germany gets 70% energy from Russia= lie (it’s more like 10%). 500 billion/year trade deficit with China = lie. Said Russia didn’t want Trump to win 2016 = lie. US began exporting oil for first time under Trump = lie. US forces=4.2%GDP lie
3006 2018-07-18 18:06:10 I trust oil companies more than a group trying to privatize water. With oil you know they just want to drill, pump and leave. You SOBs want to make people pay - while getting water for a fraction of going rate - for a fundamental life requirement
3007 2018-07-18 18:05:56 oil change time
3008 2018-07-18 18:05:49 I need a oil change  I swear I hate sitting in the dealer waiting  they need give out loaners for oil changes 
3009 2018-07-18 18:05:49 I would argue that Republicans are not so much protecting Trump but protecting their own asses...Remember Russia hacked the RNC and have yet to release that intel...Republicans are also protecting Big Biz who may have and/or want to do business (oil) deals with Russia.
3010 2018-07-18 18:05:47 A very sad day! :-(
Just finished the final bottle of the awesome olive oil I was given in Puglia last summer, pressed from the olives from the trees under which I was camping.
Incredible flavour. Best I've ever tasted.

3013 2018-07-18 18:05:40 Humid weather & long thick hair (+ I’ve ran out of hail oil) is a hellish combo. I wish I had the balls for a pixie cut but I doubt it will ever happen...plus I barely have a jawline

UKOG  'most productive period producing an implied daily dry oil rate of 228 bopd over a 2hr period'

24hr period = 2700+ barrels a day   

WTF???!!!

3035 2018-07-18 18:03:56 No, NOT booming. DOW has barely moved in 7 months. Unemp went UP in June. Inflation rate is higher than wage increases. Fuel oil prices increased over 30%. Job growth is slowing down. Companies are leaving U.S. or out of business. GDP dropped in Q1 & was well below highs in 2017.

3047 2018-07-18 18:02:34 Norway’s economy is based on oil. Both Norway and Denmark the USA pays for their defense. All countries has a homogeneous Germanic ethnic society. So much for diversity is our strength. Sweden is the biggest at 10 million people and is a Monarchy. None are socialist.
3048 2018-07-18 18:02:27 He's such a snake oil salesman!

3049 2018-07-18 18:02:24 Extreme wildfire behavior began 10yrs ago as a DIRECT result of oil and gas carbon pollution creating much warmer nights, longer droughts and beetle proliferation. Some fires now burn DOWNHILL, etc. PG&E sparks sure, but this a secondary cause.

3092 2018-07-18 17:57:17 It is no more difficult to clean up a radioactive materials discharge than an oil spill. Fear-based mythology strongly suggests otherwise. But WHO and UN multi-decade studies prove that to be true.

3115 2018-07-18 17:54:00 The @TEDTalks video was truly amazing. A very impressive quantum leap from Step 1. We have identified, measured and cataloged thousands of crude oil storage tanks manually. This is a game changer.

3117 2018-07-18 17:53:50 Right, fair enough. In that case I'd say go for it or the Malibu, just make sure you can get maintenance records to see that the oil was changed enough, etc etc
3118 2018-07-18 17:53:30 Exit though the gift shop and pick up your bottle of olive oil. Only $40 a liter.
3119 2018-07-18 17:53:26 if you accept us to spend more then the oil clubs you will be disappointed....
3120 2018-07-18 17:53:24 I chose to talk only about this two topics, but Trump is also hurting Russsia unleashing the US oil and gas production,arming the Ukranians, making NATO stronger by forcing them to pay their fair-share,enforcing and expanding the Magnitsky Act, enforcing the Crimea sanctions...

3126 2018-07-18 17:53:01 You realize John Kerry and Joe Biden spoke against the pipeline as a bad deal for Europe back in 2016 right? Pretty sure American energy independence (“dominance”) is a bipartisan goal, you do realize it was Obama who lifted a 40 year ban to export crude oil in 2015 #factsarehard

3128 2018-07-18 17:52:40 tip!!

If u use smudgepot liner like me (I like it bc it lasts a long time), and it starts to dry up toward the last few amounts, use a drop of argan oil to re-moisten the pigment!

Bc the oil is one that our skin will soak up n drink, the liner won't budge after it dries!!!

- try something new with your hair; go out of your comfort zone
- always take good care of your hair; do masks with avocado,honey,eggs etc, put product in it if necessary ( curls definer, argan oil etc)
- always have your hair clean when going out but don’t overwash it!!

I'm NOT a Dr, but if you can't get them to treat you, Manuka Honey/Manuka oil is super awesome for nail infections (do your research). Btdt. Yes your nail may never be  but it should grow back. Takes time. 

Good luck!

3249 2018-07-18 17:39:25 Yeah...well, doctors also used to tell people that cocaine, cigarettes and bacon were healthy. A parenting article also suggested putting baby oil on a baby and putting them in the sun to get a "healthy" glow...AKA, future skin cancer...docs can be wrong!

3256 2018-07-18 17:38:31 More seriously I wasn’t aware that there were Ru bots doing climate change denial. Has anyone studied this particular issue?  Is it related more to sowing political division in the US or more bc Ru is protecting its oil interests?

Giving tax breaks to their millionaire/billionaire friends, lining their own pockets, getting gov't contracts for their businesses, cutting regulations on their & their friends interests and ruining the environment so oil and gas can plunder.

3. Moving the embassy? Spend $20.2 million to create more unrest.. good plan? also see item 1

3329 2018-07-18 17:28:37 So you agree that Venezuela isn't and wasn't socialist or communist, they are capitalist who were right wing for a long time and then when they tried to improve living standards and working conditions the oil prices crashed. Real lesson learned is that they should've diversified
3330 2018-07-18 17:28:22 I just love solar,  I just absolutely love solar,  why (in the long run) would we continue to dig deep holes in the ground to extract energy,  when we can collect it on the surface.   I still think oil has an extremely important short and mid term use case but not long long term
3331 2018-07-18 17:28:18 And yet you once said oil sands should be kept in the ground. Love to know what changed your opinion.

3358 2018-07-18 17:25:49 They have to buy oil and gas. Do you want them to buy it only from us? That'd sure make our firms happy, but it's not how the international energy market works and it's not very reasonable. In any case, we can sanction Russian energy exports and make other energy sources cheaper.

3386 2018-07-18 17:23:42 If it’s a limited resource, doesn’t it make sense to wait for prices to recover? PA also had an early oil boom in the 19th century ... and then ran out of oil before oil became more valuable in the 20th century.

3389 2018-07-18 17:23:29 Oil is a commodity based on world prices and when they fell they ended up affecting Alberta and Canada economies and causing a downturn. And you are still resorting to bullying I see. We have the right to stand up against big oil. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #keepitintheground

So I guess 228 bopd = 228 barrels a day.
I would've thought they collected 19 barrels over the 2 hours which was extrapolated to 228 bopd.
3510 2018-07-18 17:11:41 This is because of- a post I thought I untagged y'all in to chipwattsinterpreter about decreasing California's reliance on foreign oil by dissolving the CARB and making California abide solely by US environmental laws. It was just an alternative solution.

3512 2018-07-18 17:11:21 Yep UR right why US/Saudi/Russia alliance? And get Iran off ticket oil rallies
3513 2018-07-18 17:11:21 I should’ve changed my own oil today.
3514 2018-07-18 17:11:14 i use a leave in and moisturizer (+ maybe gel), then seal with coconut oil. coconut oil may not work for you so you’ll have to play around with some other oils.
3515 2018-07-18 17:11:13 Obama made a deal w/the Saudis to flood the market w/oil. This wrecked the Russian economy and brought the Iranians to the bargaining table. Yet Noah keeps pushing this idea that Trump has been "tougher"; as evidence cites sanctions passed by veto proof majorities in Congress.
3516 2018-07-18 17:11:06 Bush used that gold to payback the Saudi's for bailing out his failed oil company. Why you think he went to work for their gold company when he left the whitehouse
3517 2018-07-18 17:11:05 This article assumes coherence of policy, when there is no actual evidence of that. The evidence cited speaks more to the butterfly effect (oil prices) or to government employees who aren’t traitors continuing to serve this nation despite their boss (brussels decl).
3518 2018-07-18 17:10:58 What a ridiculous analogy!! I don't plan on ingesting oil/coal/gas. If you can read, I said they were natural. I didn't say all natural things were non-poisonous. However, as you believe CO2 is poison, stop breathing, as you exhale 100x the level you inhale.
3519 2018-07-18 17:10:57  . . . oh yeah.  We're not stupid or ignorant enough to overlook his actions which have been devastating on Russia.  Financial sanctions, diplomatic expulsions, missiles to Syria (TWICE), telling NATO countries not to buy Russian oil . . . actions speak louder than words!

3521 2018-07-18 17:10:43 i love when people on fb ask for skincare advice so i chime in since i’m a professional, and they overlook my advice for the dumb bitch suggesting coconut oil.
3522 2018-07-18 17:10:42 Saya pas lagi di daerah yang 4 musim, terutama pas musim dingin, hobi banget pake olive oil buat moisturizer. Cuma sedihnya dia comedogenic kan, gak diterusin deh. : " )

3524 2018-07-18 17:10:40 Eyes upon Golan Heights; I posted a while back that Genie Energy's board of advisors are a list of all that's wrong in the world, and they want that oil NOW.
3525 2018-07-18 17:10:32 Best of luck, Amy. Another great initiative pushed by you. Have you tried CBD oil, jellies or other alternatives?
3526 2018-07-18 17:10:31 So glad Megan my granddaughter came to day to help me with ministry work. She also volunteered to wash and chop all these vegetables to make sad for three days for us. She enjoyed her labor by eating her salad with 15 grain bread dipped in Olive Oil and Hommus. Thanks Znegan.
3527 2018-07-18 17:10:30 got an online ad for some oil against stretch marks. 
thank u i never want to see this again
3528 2018-07-18 17:10:29 MOOD!!! Hot oil treatments are fantastic, they have them for like $3 at Sally’s. My hair is so dry from dying it and I’ve been doin blonde for the past few months- hair masks are your friend!!! I use the ones at Walmart too and my hair colorist says she can feel a difference
3529 2018-07-18 17:10:28 Same reason why oil companies can rise when oil prices and futures fall. Labor expense news
3530 2018-07-18 17:10:20 Bs man.  That’s only part of it.  Why are we subsidizing them buying russian oil that we have to protect them from.  Why not from US?  Plus their tariffs are exceedingly high on our products. More subsidization   Plus our products get taxed high.
3531 2018-07-18 17:10:16 I'd agree, don't really match the wood TBH. Do you fancy keeping them as white pine, or using e.g. wood oil to bring out the grain?
3532 2018-07-18 17:10:10 I was caught off guard by how fun Oil Ocean was! Snosnic Mania is truly a mastapeese.

3534 2018-07-18 17:10:05 My antipasto salad is always just "surprise" salad. I don't do anything traditional because I don't eat meat for the most part, so I throw in olives and banana peppers and pickles and cherries and whatever else is small and nearly salad like and toss it with olive oil. Surprise!

3536 2018-07-18 17:10:03 Meat and dairy companies are poised to surpass the oil industry as the world’s biggest polluters. I guess the Chick-fil-A ad campaign isn't working.
3537 2018-07-18 17:09:57 Bullshit. Ill bring the bless oil on my first visit! Lol

3540 2018-07-18 17:09:50 So @SteveBakerHW, snake oil seller and #BrexitBastard, facts. The EU aerospace and science is surpassing the US, the German economy is in surplus with a manufacturing base that surpassed ours 30 years ago and our economy is financially bust. Time is up, BURN.
3541 2018-07-18 17:09:23 This year I'm having some problems with the joints in my hands hurting. What I've found helps best- rubbing on rosemary essential oil. It works better for me than any other. Takes the pain and stiffness away for hours/days.
3542 2018-07-18 17:09:22 Oil change today, doctors appointment later & then with baby 
3543 2018-07-18 17:09:19 sorry, your NYC BBQ sucks...cant have our oil either
3544 2018-07-18 17:09:09 Why, @haven , does your on-site chip shop fry in palm oil? Do you not know what palm oil is doing to the rainforests? The guy working at the chippy certainly had no idea why I was asking if it was sustainable!
3545 2018-07-18 17:09:07 It’s during cuddling my stomach loves to be “skrip pap pap” sounding like hot oil that they just threw onions into
3546 2018-07-18 17:08:53 Production day!!!  So far , Car washed. Oil changed  tires changed. Push thru procrastination!!!
3547 2018-07-18 17:08:53 And we assassinated Iran's elected president in 1953, and installed a puppet leader who gave us their oil, so they kinda had good reasons to not like us. If any other country did that to the US, you'd support bombing that country into oblivion. So don't forget history.
3548 2018-07-18 17:08:49 Just tell people its nipple oil
3549 2018-07-18 17:08:38 Go with the olive oil option and use a good one. Adds so much flavor and is very good for your innards.
3550 2018-07-18 17:08:28 Have fun spreading "oil is good"" soon it won't be around. I won't response back. I'll leave you to bath in that oil you love so much... use a good soap.

3560 2018-07-18 17:07:31 rosehip oil works amazingly well - i use that mixed with 1 drop of argan oil usually and its perfect. the key is to balance linoleic and oleic fatty acids <3
3561 2018-07-18 17:07:18 OMG I ACCIDENTALLY PUT GAS I THE OIL PART//////
3562 2018-07-18 17:07:15 My rule of thumb is everytime I get an oil change, I do a tire rotation. Most places, a tire rotation is free with an oil change.

3567 2018-07-18 17:06:43 Pretty simple. Europe likes Scotland. If they could stop laughing at the UK long enough to actively dislike them....they'd find they despised them. *typed using the last drop of oil in Scotland* *according to sir Ian wouldnt*

3580 2018-07-18 17:05:15 So I brought my car for an oil change... they say it's gonna be between 12-12:30 for it to be done. . As long as it's done before 12:30, cuz I have to drive ALL the way to work, in Santa Monica. .
3581 2018-07-18 17:05:13 Oh sure sweetie - as long as YOU DON"T FORGET:

Trump has
-lethally armed Ukraine
-blasted Syria
-very heavily sanctioned Russia
-lifted our oil export ban to harm Russia
-pushed for strengthening NATO financially

While your precious Obama refused these actions & abetted Putin
3582 2018-07-18 17:04:54 And he’s still not the richest person on earth. Not even close.
There’s families who own the central banks & oil companies & tax companies & military industrial complex that don’t even register for the Forbes list.
They pay for the TRILLIONS of dollars spent on our defense budget

Post interested and I'll send you info
3643 2018-07-18 16:58:30 I can't believe that we will be challenging man City on a even playing field with all the oil money they have its going to be a brilliant season for us #YNWA #LFC #LFCFamily
3644 2018-07-18 16:58:30 lol.. My friend.. don’t do long like you be kiddie you no know.. I make mistake sef.. Like I want talk say “to lube arses OIL is required.. so what’s your point”?
3645 2018-07-18 16:58:10 Only way out of trap is to break free from oil's monopoly on moving things. TX natgas can make ultra cheap #methanol for flex fuel vehicles
3646 2018-07-18 16:58:08 Defo rubs oil on that head as well. Blinded by the shine
3647 2018-07-18 16:58:07 have u tried joboba oil? Apparently it works wonders because it's structure is closest to sebum

3649 2018-07-18 16:58:01 Sitting at #elkgrovetoyota for nearly 3hrs. Seriously all I needed was an oil change & service.
3650 2018-07-18 16:58:00 I need one of you bearded black kings to come oil my scalp
3651 2018-07-18 16:58:00 Great! Now can we focus on opening up jobs in industries that promote clean power and more environmentally conscious practices, rather than those that only serve to reinforce our reliance on oil as global currency and line the pockets of the rich?
3652 2018-07-18 16:57:59 Not quite.  While the oil price may indeed be volatile, it's 3-5% price movements in a day are rare while Bitcoin's 5-10% price movements are much more numerous.  Bitcoin's volatility beats gold and oil by several standard deviations.
3653 2018-07-18 16:57:57 I hope it is virgin olive oil
3654 2018-07-18 16:57:56 อ้อร้อแท้
3655 2018-07-18 16:57:50 All in long crude oil futures no stop lol those were the days
3656 2018-07-18 16:57:45 I need to get my oil changed but I also want to get my nails done 
3657 2018-07-18 16:57:38 This #tcheck machines doesn't work.  IT SUCKS!!! The first generation of this machine worked fine but it's now discontinued.  This new machine that suppose to test the potency of flower doesn't work.  Can't even correctly test cannabis oil without it giving a reading of "OVER".

3660 2018-07-18 16:57:31 After they come out get some vitamin e oil, it helps with healing and lessening scarring.
3661 2018-07-18 16:57:28 @FairfaxKia over an hour and a half for an oil change? Unacceptable. Relocating to another dealer ASAP.
3662 2018-07-18 16:57:24 Did you look inside the statue for some Olive Oil?  Just saying.....
3663 2018-07-18 16:57:17 #Ihate getting an oil change.. or waiting to get an oil change
3664 2018-07-18 16:57:07 Do I really want to drive an hour away to get my oil changed
3665 2018-07-18 16:56:51 Or NY could lower their state and local taxes.
3666 2018-07-18 16:56:44 I just got hot oil in my eye lol feels ok tho

3671 2018-07-18 16:56:31 I cannot live without ground black pepper, peanut butter or olive oil.
3672 2018-07-18 16:56:30 Yup, Sam's chunky bit sweet potato wedges....rock!!! I just do the coconut oil and the HPinkSalt.....yum.
3673 2018-07-18 16:56:30 Tinfoil hats? it is amazing to see the level pro pipeline supporters will go to blame protesters and make assumptions about people who stand up to big oil. The people who are against pipelines are strong and are not going away. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet
3674 2018-07-18 16:56:27 I'm pretty sure that oil based paints make me hungry spent all day glossing and eating
3675 2018-07-18 16:56:15 Of all the mercials your god supposedly could perform he's chosen to make oil come out of a statue. A true under performer! Now, had he grown a leg back for an amputee I might raise an eyebrow!
3676 2018-07-18 16:56:11 Mideast oil remains far cheaper to extract and refine than our cheapest. Racing through the latter leaves us more vulnerable long term
3677 2018-07-18 16:56:07 You all tried to cover his statement up by using this change of one word. Your attempt fails, it changes nothing of the meaning of his whole statement. You are giving us snake oil! @realDonaldTrump
3678 2018-07-18 16:56:01 oilとsoilって語呂良すぎなんだが
3679 2018-07-18 16:56:01 need an oil masseur pool side?
3680 2018-07-18 16:56:00 Nailed by the snake oil salesman....oh well!
3681 2018-07-18 16:55:50 Police say an Iraqi teen living in Texas with her parents was beaten and burned with hot oil for resisting an arranged marriage. The parents face felony charges.
3682 2018-07-18 16:55:43 ﾋｯ　しんでる　差分やばい
3683 2018-07-18 16:55:34 Gua milk cleanser yg viva, lu pake apa kalo oil cleanser?
3684 2018-07-18 16:55:22 So you can spill Red oil all inside your car?! 
3685 2018-07-18 16:55:04 I watched an item about Japanese designers trying to do this for small apt buildings. Expensive as I recall. Almost more of a "can this be done"? Rather than "it's a good idea and everyone should do it."
3686 2018-07-18 16:55:00 Do you need a quick oil change? Schedule an appointment today! #OilChange #Richmond #AutoService
3687 2018-07-18 16:54:46 Oil is another word as well that just sounds funny in a southern accent
3688 2018-07-18 16:54:45 Us easy for USA if they tried .
Russia saved all our countries from our common enemy the Germans .
Russia is our friend and ally .
And ,not only is it biggest country in world ...
It is by any reasonable measure the richest !
Has unquantifiable oil/gas/mineral &renewable energy
3689 2018-07-18 16:54:20 Thanks.  The transformer on our property has been leaking oil from it for the last few months.  Alectra has advised it will be replaced by end of July.
3690 2018-07-18 16:54:17 What about arming Ukraine/Georgia, restarting missile defense in Poland, increasing domestic military spending and requiring NATO allies to do the same, increasing domestic oil production, showing strength in Syria, ending Iran deal.....think that’s playing into Putin’s hands?
3691 2018-07-18 16:54:17 It was really good. So simple...just a bit of avocado oil in a frying pan, the veggies, some leftover chicken.....
3692 2018-07-18 16:54:13 Not many people know that oil drilling causes natural disasters
3693 2018-07-18 16:54:02 I stopped going to frat parties that served alcohol after i witnessed oil being made. I was like oh that’s what we doing here? Ok
3694 2018-07-18 16:53:55 Monsanto, and likely tar sands oil pollution, maybe. Tar sands oil is deadly.
3695 2018-07-18 16:53:39 Why don’t you do something about it Is it because they don’t have oil or is because you selling the Arms to the Saoudi .
3696 2018-07-18 16:53:35 My dad has throat cancer stage four to late for surgery and it’s in his lymph nodes. He’s tried the CBD with THC oil that’s not a cure it’s not done one thing and he’s a Medicare patient at Vanderbilt hospital in Nashville Tennessee they do all the new immunotherapy on Medicare!
3697 2018-07-18 16:53:30 ask about homeopathic stuff, dried kombucha or liquid form and cbd oil with green tea. helps reboot the system.
3698 2018-07-18 16:53:25 Seen. Holdings seem to have changed hands severally over the years. Afren in the thick of it all. GEC claims estimated gas volume of 300 billion cubic feet and 80 million barrels oil in place from Igbariam-1 in OPL 917. Sigh. Local gas market is poor sha.
3699 2018-07-18 16:53:20 Given it's oil burning machine, not electrical, @Caltrain is a heater running train by definition, right?
3700 2018-07-18 16:53:16 Just cut my knee changing the oil in my car. Feel like I’m 12.
3701 2018-07-18 16:53:12 Sama2 mantul. Kan sama2 oil kaa hehe
3702 2018-07-18 16:53:03 自分は何でもできるｱﾆﾒｰﾀｰ目指してるから何でもやるけど、唯一ロボだけはヤダッっていってる……挑戦すべきなのかな……Σ(Ｔ▽Ｔ;)
3703 2018-07-18 16:53:03 I make a hair and scalp oil, ma. It promotes growth, helps with moisture retention, cell regeneration, treats dandruff and dry scalp. Been working on a new formulation and branding. Sending out samples in August. I'll send you some in exchange for feedback on the oil. Keen?
3704 2018-07-18 16:52:58 死体しかないんですけど…
3705 2018-07-18 16:52:57 Use BEHR Oil Deck Stain or just deck paint to stop  future rotting.
3706 2018-07-18 16:52:47 last minute dark money and a lot of it, with politician involved, Im skeptical, and I hope New @NewApproachMO is too, else it'll be another four yrs of waiting for what we want, or oil only at only state registered dispensaries. Nobody is bashing, how bout stating the damn truth,
3707 2018-07-18 16:52:42 What a stupid little man he is,always thought that anyway,i love watching yourself and Prof Alice Roberts,it's about what you know,not what you look like,besides,you look ok to me.
He's no oil painting himself!
3708 2018-07-18 16:52:41 Oil going to keep rising but apple about to hit the trillion mark so
3709 2018-07-18 16:52:18 This only goes for liverpool aswell apparently as man city only uses oil money and dont have any of these incoms
3710 2018-07-18 16:52:12 @tomfriedman says he has a motto 'whereever there's oil, there's trouble' #FortuneTech
3711 2018-07-18 16:52:12 "I have a motto in life: wherever there's oil, there's trouble." @tomfriedman @brainstormtech #FortuneTech

I just can't imagine why we ever started using steel and concrete. 
3713 2018-07-18 16:52:07 @tomfriedman “Wherever there is oil, there is trouble.”  Natural resource insulates you from need to adapt - when you don’t have it, you have to focus on adapting your people.  #FortuneTech @tableau
3714 2018-07-18 16:51:57 What's Thomas Friedman's motto in life? "Wherever there's oil there's trouble." #FortuneTech
3715 2018-07-18 16:51:53 Let's see if I can get an oil change done before work 
3716 2018-07-18 16:51:43 Lo paso a Gas Oil?
3717 2018-07-18 16:51:41 oh yeah! we need a united front to tackle the larger issue of plastics but this is just the way oil companies get to continue profiting off of the insane amount of plastic we use. idk why people don't realize you can both reduce your single use plastic AND fight corporations
3718 2018-07-18 16:51:36 I should have realised that I would have a shocker of a day when I knocked over my open bottle of @Odacite face oil and spilled half of it on the floor.  #fml
3719 2018-07-18 16:51:36 The first and most important ingredient in our habanero oil!!!!! Looks like this batch might be spicy!!!!!!!! Coming in hot!!!!!
3720 2018-07-18 16:51:33 Congratulations Chief. Great achievement, now come let's control our Oil.
3721 2018-07-18 16:51:22 Omg what . Germany is paying Russia billions for gas and oil. Imagine what You and Europe would say if trump made the same deal with Putin

3724 2018-07-18 16:51:11 If oil transport to Europe was made more difficult, oil price would rise significantly. Mullahs need ridiculously priced oil, to fund their corrupt economic model.
3725 2018-07-18 16:51:10 لا اسما oil oil بس انكتبت بالغلط
3726 2018-07-18 16:51:07 My friend : "the scented oil we bought earlier smells like yoshua what should i do-"

Me : "yoshua who."

My friend : ".... I mean yo sua."
3727 2018-07-18 16:51:07 Huh? You're the genius who thinks that america will export oil, even though we're importing it.
3728 2018-07-18 16:51:06 Without fresh water you will die in just a few days.  Plain and simple, no sugar coating, water equals life. Would you eat a fish with some weed killer marinade, or drink water with a nice motor oil sheen on top? Go Green, Save Water #WellnessWednesday @zenithbank
3729 2018-07-18 16:50:53 Trump has sanctioned Putin’s son in law. His best friend. The biggest oil oligarch. And on.
3730 2018-07-18 16:50:48 The objective is to reduce dependance on primary energy consumption from fossil fuels.

BP statistical review shows we still get 85% of our energy from oil gas and coal. Clearly renewables have failed to make any impact despite trillions $ of investment.
3731 2018-07-18 16:50:45 So then we'll be more dependent on foreign oil rather than less. Great plan- really solves the Russia problem.
3732 2018-07-18 16:50:39 The so called 51.9% couldn't agree amongst themselves as to how brexit would look and the snake oil salesman sold many different versions. So they aren't representing democracy at all just a minority of loudmouths who back a hard brexit
3733 2018-07-18 16:50:20 Is it extra virgin olive oil?
3734 2018-07-18 16:50:13 โอ้ยยยยววเนี้ยยยยยยก็ตะเเซ่บขึ้นไปทุกวี่วันนอดทนค่ะกุรอจบ
3735 2018-07-18 16:50:13 You're the genius who thinks the USA which is an importer of oil can export it.  #Enstien.
3736 2018-07-18 16:50:13 Hey @nissan how do I reset this “maintenance oil filter/engine oil” warning on my dash?  Just had my oil changed and they didn’t clear it.  2008 Altima
3737 2018-07-18 16:50:11 I have a response to Rob who called earlier. If Putin is not an enemy of the US then why did he accuse Merkel of holding Germany hostage by buying Russian oil?
3738 2018-07-18 16:50:11 at any given moment i’m PROBABLY thinking about that bread in restaurants that you dip into olive oil and herbs
3739 2018-07-18 16:50:08 City have only won things because of oil money and your fans can’t fill a stadium. You might also win a European Cup one day too 
3740 2018-07-18 16:49:55 Trump the #APPEASER subjugating the #USA in a degrading spectacle.
#magaCULT snap out of cognative dissonance Treason #Trump is antiAmerican and proPutin's Russian mafia thugs. Stop selling out American values, virtues and fellow  citizens to this snake oil peddler of lies.

3748 2018-07-18 16:48:56 Is anyone willing to share their experiences with CBD oil.  In those places where it is legal, it seems to be helping?  Should we fund a study on this?
3749 2018-07-18 16:48:53 PSA: Find the ripest summer tomatoes, pop in some boiling water, peel, chop, loosely purée, strain off a bit of juice, add a glug of olive oil, a crushed clove of garlic, salt & pepper. And for the love of god, serve on toasted crusty sourdough bread. IT’S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
3750 2018-07-18 16:48:51 When hipsters whisper in coffee shops it's called whipstering. Typically the hippest whipstering is reserved for topics like mustache oil and vegan homesteading, but after Helsinki I imagine many a coffee shop was abuzz with hip, hip Trump adulation.
3751 2018-07-18 16:48:42 Just like the $USO doesn't track Oil accurately over time. Short term it works pretty well, but you need to chart Oil futures...
3752 2018-07-18 16:48:39 Where are the cries of cultural appropriation against Rhianna for her new hair, and by calls I mean me rubbing tanning oil all over her while on a beach 
3753 2018-07-18 16:48:38 Was the oil "extra virgin"?
3754 2018-07-18 16:48:29 Increased US & NATO Defense spending, increased sanctions, increased oil production, bombing Syria, out of Iran agreement. Trump has been MUCH tougher on Russia than Obama. I think what journalists in DC should be asking is this: What did Putin have on OBAMA???
3755 2018-07-18 16:48:14 Would that be their oil reserves?
3756 2018-07-18 16:48:12 Snake oil. Snort preworkout instead.

3760 2018-07-18 16:47:54 It’s never been a secret that Jeremy Pruitt’s personality fit Mark Richt’s personality like peanut butter fits motor oil. I’m not sure why anyone is acting surprised at the comments from Pollack, Murray, etc.

There are different ways to go about your business and win.
3761 2018-07-18 16:47:51 @thecoreyholcomb said spit is motor oil for pussy lmao #5150
3762 2018-07-18 16:47:48 Bredda I shock. I swear all this time men out here collecting DNA and fingerprints to aid in investigations. 
So you mean to tell me, we didn't think to invest in this ALL along? We had big oil money all this time just for men to thief?
What is this madness?

3768 2018-07-18 16:47:19 I said I would never turn into my mom but here I am working from home, cooking everything in coconut oil, putting Lavender essential oil on, all while listening to Christian music in my headphones even though I’m here alone. Mom I am you. hope you are happy

3779 2018-07-18 16:46:13 THE PART AHERE HYOJONG AND HYUNA ARE IN THE BATHTUB OF OIL
3780 2018-07-18 16:46:08 i just cried because i got excited that i’m cooking healthy food for myself right now. like, i put coconut oil in a pan, added spinach to it and mushrooms and started crying because healthy food really is beautiful.
3781 2018-07-18 16:46:08 復活。コテンと寝たー
3782 2018-07-18 16:46:08 But they actually did. Those foreigners can from Europe. They took over economically and politically. They came with their ships; took Palm oil, Palm kernel oil,  groundnut,  cocoa,  timber etc. 
They are still here, in construction, extraction/mining industries etc.

3794 2018-07-18 16:45:07 Large areas of natural vegetation and forests have been cleared and burned to grow soybeans and palm oil trees to make biodiesel. The negative environmental impacts of land clearing may be greater than any potential benefits of using biodiesel produced from soybeans and palm oil.

3798 2018-07-18 16:44:42 Restructuring the country can't happen in one day, it will take years. It's easy for you to say restructuring because the South south has oil but you forget about the basic and technical things like health, agriculture, education.

3803 2018-07-18 16:43:55 I had a roommate of rich parents that ruined two cars because he drove them until the oil ran out. He didn’t know you were supposed to regularly change the oil.

3813 2018-07-18 16:42:41 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. We won't even miss it!
3814 2018-07-18 16:42:38 I can’t live without mountains of butter... for everything, sauces, roux, baking, oh and toast and spuds. That and... lemons (I slice and freeze if i have too many) same with ginger. Always have ginger. Soy sauce, balsamic, olive oil and a stash of tinned tomatoes
3815 2018-07-18 16:42:27 Thanks. Without putting oil on it I look like The Lorax.

3822 2018-07-18 16:41:04 yup.  I was involved (at a very low level) in some of the Oil & Gas plays.  Not a good corporate fit and literally billions of dollars were squandered. 

But hey, he's got a great parachute so all good

3839 2018-07-18 16:39:50 Gorka, you have no credibility to talk about security professionals. You are a “peddler of snake oil” with your nose deep in the trough.

You’re protecting us about as well as molested wrestlers.

3869 2018-07-18 16:36:42 America is going to limit or ban oil exports from Iran meaning you get sanctioned by the U.S if you buy oil from Iran, i think a lot of countries will end up not buying that oil

3874 2018-07-18 16:36:12 The sudden plunge in oil prices could grant the Trump administration more leeway as it tries to shut in Iranian supply. The spike in oil prices in late June seemed to cause some hesitation on the application of Iran sanctions by the U.S.; the selloff in oil prices

3892 2018-07-18 16:34:55 I track everything including olive oil or butter that I cook with excluding the very occasional “I’m going to be negative but I’m going to eat this ice cream or drink this cocktail” cheat. It’s important to track the small stuff because that’s what adds up.
3893 2018-07-18 16:34:51 Morula oil even on its own is really good for the skin especially in winter.
3894 2018-07-18 16:34:46 No, but growing what you can't combined with making coherent, informed, and ethical shopping selections can make a huge difference. Don't like what they're doing for palm oil? Don't eat anything with palm oil. Don't support the massive deforestation in South America for

3896 2018-07-18 16:34:18 You must have the oil industry in your pocket while people who have cars go outside city limits to go shopping and avoid your fake "public interest" taxes.  Maybe if you idiots in the city government didn't misplace millions, you wouldn't need the soda tax.

3901 2018-07-18 16:33:46 We are doing better, however for instance California's environmental policies see it favoring foreign oil rather than US oil. The big one's that we've really lacked the LPG export infrastructure and're now basically in need of more investment in transport for oil to export to EU.

3912 2018-07-18 16:32:37 I use a home made coffee scrub once a week or so. It’s not completely dry, it has some oil in it (grape seed or coconut) but I think I get the same affects on texture and tone as dry brushing- with same added moisturizing. I don’t use the scrub above my neck though

3914 2018-07-18 16:32:28 NPT - the best fluid connection technology the 19th century has to offer.

Seriously, the taper angle is 1 degree and 47 minutes. Why? Probably because that's the incline that pipe flowing full of whale oil requires to reach a velocity of 500 leagues per fortnight.

3929 2018-07-18 16:30:56 Well, its important for Nigeria to also have its own airline when we consider economic growth & divestment away from crude oil. 

However, its very necessary that all bottlenecks that could mitigate the progress air business should have first been address from cost of fuel, /1

3931 2018-07-18 16:30:46 I do however refuse to agree that a dictator is good for a society.That is being ignorant to the defenition thereof, be it that the west(cia) wanted to keep the oil for themselves, or they felt threatened by such strong leadership... He was a dictator withholding democracy...

3960 2018-07-18 16:28:22 And where do government get funds for building those solar fields. From revenues from oil royalties and taxes from companies using oil for production. This has to be a gradual conversion,  one needs revenue from old resources to develop new renewable ones. #DCYNOISOYF

3962 2018-07-18 16:28:05 So, you won’t answer even one question. There are many. Another, if Russsia is truly an adversary are you o.k. with Germany, in NATO, buying billions of dollars of oil and gas from them? 
Finally, what is your end-game on this? Military? Sanctions don’t work, haven’t worked.

3964 2018-07-18 16:27:47 On Africa, you have to look at Nigeria to see how absolutely right you are. Britain helped kill 3 million #Biafrans (1967-1970) for oil. Paving the way to using the vilest in their amalgamated Nigeria for their modernized colonization, and leaving the place a real sh*thole today.

3970 2018-07-18 16:27:21 Slick don’t need it. Most of the stuff that’s in oil is in the custard 
3971 2018-07-18 16:27:16 Whether that’s true or not (it isn’t: oil is actually propping up Nordic economies) - UK fishing industry is NOT one of our major industries, and it will never be. It is also likely to be traded away in the Brexit settlement, in favour of the services sector. This was inevitable.

Has anyone investigated what and how that company makes its money? What is it shipping and where anyway?  Is this why McConnell won't support the investigation?
3978 2018-07-18 16:26:25 Thank goodness we stay dependent on fossil fuels. Why would we not bless west Texas for being the worlds number one source of wind energy. Oh yeah how would the folks who pay the GOP react to that?  Where is the link between Putin and Trump. Oil!!!
3979 2018-07-18 16:26:22 The world's biggest oil traders are counting hefty losses after a surprise doubling in the price discount of U.S. light crude to benchmark Brent in just a month, as surging U.S production upends the market.

Today's economists are the modern day snake oil salesmen all claiming to have found a cure. Austerity is a nonsense.
3988 2018-07-18 16:25:30 Sounds about like my situation 83,000 miles and the engine cooler pipe was a known issue where it leaks oil. Now they replaced it, but it failed again and now i need a new engine.

4000 2018-07-18 16:24:33 Someone either designed the statue to weep olive oil, or someone keeps strategically reapplying olive oil below the statue’s eyelids.  This can be easily determined by setting up a few hidden cameras and performing an X-ray scan on the statue.

4018 2018-07-18 16:22:11 Good plan. We should make our European Union allies do the same too. We should increase oil production, LPG exports, and advice our allies they will be sanctioned if doing business with Russia or Iran. The problem now is we can't yet actually replace them entirely.

4045 2018-07-18 16:19:08 That's still a huge environmental cost compared to products that can be reused - producing things on a massive scale that are then discarded.

4119 2018-07-18 16:13:46 yeah I've been using castor oil on my hair for like a year now... I don't think it has anything to do with the growth of my hair but it's v thick and healthy considering I use heat

4129 2018-07-18 16:12:30 Of all the things Trump's said and done, giving Alaska back to Russia would be the last straw for the political establishment, but only because Alaska has oil. That said, defense contractors would love if it was suddenly decided that Alaska was a threat requiring 'regime change'.

4134 2018-07-18 16:11:26 Currency is a tool used to buy and trade goods and services. If currency used was to have a real tangible value then we would be carrying viles of crude oil or any other traded item as currency. This issue was solved with fiat (paper). Cryptos are digital fiat and more

4136 2018-07-18 16:11:08 I don't think Canada is hostile to  the oil and gas industry. I think we've been too lax with them. With Redwater dec we're stuck to pay env liabilities. I imagine that the SCC won't change this decision. Not to mention tailings ponds. @OilGasCanada What about subsidies? Amusing.

4166 2018-07-18 16:08:32 complacency is the worst thing you can do, in that sort of time congress will probably support the official annexation of the west bank and golan heights to israel so they can build an oil pipeline into europe
4167 2018-07-18 16:08:30 It's a ideal project guitar, fretboard looks like it needs a oil, I'd strip down to wood and lemon oil only, add a through body bridge checking the spacing at the widest part of neck i.e F (fender spacing) and u wld need a f type pickup.

4172 2018-07-18 16:08:04 Why are they fighting so hard about this? 

There are provisions in the law specifically to allow bendable straws for differently abled bodies.

4197 2018-07-18 16:06:00 Actually, Andrea is right. Adding olive oil is useless. If your spaghetti stick together, that means you can't cook spaghetti. Simple as that

4206 2018-07-18 16:05:11 Don’t apologise ... I just won’t  use that oil again
4207 2018-07-18 16:04:57 Yeah, like the EU deal with Japan just announced; like the TPP countries new agreement; like the 7 plus % decrease in farm income the Dept of Ag forecasts for this year. Art of the deal? Did you make a deal with Putin on snake oil? You both supply a lot of it

4211 2018-07-18 16:04:45 Please tell us what he’s done!  Oil which is Russia’s lifeline is now trading at $80/barrel when it was at $40/barrel when Trump was elected. That was the deal he made with Saudi’s on his very first foreign trip!
4212 2018-07-18 16:04:41 Absolutely recommend The Ordinary. So damn good. Went over to them after Lush stopped doing my foundation and haven’t looked back!  That and almond oil for skin, coconut for hair.
4213 2018-07-18 16:04:40 Going to the #Subaru dealer to get an oil change. Great service, but if that motherf----- says I need to replace my cabin air filter again I'm going to burn this city to the f------ ground. I am going to say this to him when I hand him my keys.
4214 2018-07-18 16:04:39 further, Trump has ended the ban of oil exports to try and compete with Russian energy.

 Trump hasn't done a thing to harm America with respect to Russia, and Obama did nothing to protect America when it came to Russia

4228 2018-07-18 16:03:14 So we have to be friends with Russia or it's WWIII, and we shouldn't be friends with Montenegro or it's WWIII. Then we find out that the Germany is owned by Russia because they buy gas and oil from them, but we should be doing many more deals with Russia. I can't keep up...
4229 2018-07-18 16:03:12 If you’ve been using castor oil for four years straight in the hope that it’ll get you a full beard but haven’t even got a goatee can you sue the company supplying it? Asking for a friend, of course.

4282 2018-07-18 15:58:57 If she can open a bottle of olive oil and pour it through her bronze eyes (...), let her work her magic elsewhere, where it's needed. She could do something about poverty and stop wars instead. Why stop at crying olive oil?
4283 2018-07-18 15:58:49 What's wrong with that? 
There is an emotional response to a 100% tax rate, but in effect its a few bucks a month on a gas bill. 
This is the same emotional tactic as Greenpeace quoting oil spills in litters.
4284 2018-07-18 15:58:44 I have no idea how EIA calculates legacy decline b/c they don't show the prod data from which is taken.

4312 2018-07-18 15:56:37 Actually, I posted a link showing you just that. But as usual, you shrug off facts while providing none yourself, declining even to give the gas mileage of your Lexus. You have have proved nothing.

And you do think oil is a good resource, since as a painter, YOU SELL IT.
4313 2018-07-18 15:56:14 you don't understand markets.  If I'm importing it means that the external sources (EMEA) in this case are cheaper than mine.  So why would anyone want my oil?

No way Satan uses something as banal as non-virgin mixed source olive oil (as it undoubtedly is).

4330 2018-07-18 15:54:34 the fact that oil is called aceite in spanish is confusing my italian ass
4331 2018-07-18 15:54:27 she is weeping olive oil for America
4332 2018-07-18 15:54:22 Excellent #Blockchain is the exciting part, the currencies #Bitcoin, #Digibyte, #Litecoin are the necessary oil of the machine for decentralised public Blockchains. By themselves they are the key to democratised global wealth distribution. Will find some videos
4333 2018-07-18 15:54:20 Realistically, City throw this at anyone who makes a signing. The reality is they have funded a 5 year player splurge with oil money. Very different story to raising your own funds and spending it wisely.
4334 2018-07-18 15:54:18 Neem oil is a mild antibacterial and immune booster, it improves gum health and is a gentler alternative to tea-tree for acne. — feeling fresh
4335 2018-07-18 15:54:17 It still shows to you that he is going against Russian interests!! Oil business is private business you can't stop oil companies from importing that would be Fascism Socialism!!
4336 2018-07-18 15:54:12 No, oil was piped from the tender to the firebox.
4337 2018-07-18 15:54:03 My Mermaid Lagoon candle from B & BW smells like my man's beard oil I got him 
4338 2018-07-18 15:53:55 And the oil stuff is actually I think 10 times more worrying - putting himself out there as a money-making to-between rather than "just" indulgent free-loader
4339 2018-07-18 15:53:50 my software developer coworker who has a bongo board at his standing desk just let out an audible grunt and said "Oil! Oil prices! Hammering my portfolio!"

4342 2018-07-18 15:53:39 The threat of climate change wasn't enough, but the cost of energy being cheaper, using renewable energy was a real motivator! Cheaper than coal, gas, and oil!
4343 2018-07-18 15:53:24 I don’t really eat white potatoes often, when I do  just a little salt & pepper or with broccoli & Parmesan . Sweet potatoes are delicious plain (a pinch of salt) or with a little coconut oil and cinnamon. #isitlunchtimeyet
4344 2018-07-18 15:53:13 Logic & faith are like oil & water. They don't mix. Choose one. Either way, the stakes are high. America is either collapsing or it's in God's hands. If America is collapsing, are you fighting to save her? If America is collapsing, R U rejoicing  Trump as God's will? You choose.

4348 2018-07-18 15:53:04 What is more important for American security and the protection of #NATO. Condemning 12 alleged hackers dumping info on Reddit, or selling arms and oil to #Ukraine and #Poland while speaking out against #nordstream2?

4350 2018-07-18 15:52:54 I thought we stole Iraq's oil
4351 2018-07-18 15:52:51 Lies come out hard from oil people. You still haven't shown us where the cost of EV is more then gas... I proved that wrong. Have another good 13 hours trying to pound oil as a good resource... #onpoli #cndpoli
4352 2018-07-18 15:52:50 It’s because she doesn’t want the health risks associated with vegetable oil but still wants more flavor than canola. Same here.
4353 2018-07-18 15:52:49 We shall fight in the oil fields. We shall fight in the Hill Country. We shall fight in San Jacinto....we won’t fight in Austin, you can have that
4354 2018-07-18 15:52:40 Doing something right? It's all because of the increase in oil revenue.
4355 2018-07-18 15:52:39 That sounds good as far as it goes. Acknowledging the fact that our oil addiction and the consequences  thereof consume so much of our military budget would go much further. The threat lies in our dependence on bloated opec nations and their oil.

4357 2018-07-18 15:52:36 She might be weeping olive oil possibly in Ital--but in New Mexico?  Are they sure are it's not chili pepper oil?

4359 2018-07-18 15:52:19 Olive oil ain’t cheap. Put a pan under that thing and start selling it.
4360 2018-07-18 15:52:04 Has anyone seen @vp Mike Pence lately? The Pence family is quite familiar with excess oil.
4361 2018-07-18 15:52:02 they don't,  they control their production output.  And since oil is a commodity,  the price reflects total output of all producers
4362 2018-07-18 15:51:56 But what I want to know is how are they so sure that it's olive oil **specifically?** also, virgin or no?

Hell, even the sound of this is hoaxy.
4363 2018-07-18 15:51:43 Oil pulling this morning 
4364 2018-07-18 15:51:43 Going to be useful. Going to move my girl’s car (street sweeping day tomorrow) and get my oil changed. My baby’s 1000 miles overdue!
4365 2018-07-18 15:51:36 False sense of hope. $Oil may plunge again and take some hedge money for another ride lol.

Let's see what happens.
4366 2018-07-18 15:51:27 I'll be charitable and say they were going off the severe service schedule on the oil. That's silly and the rest is ultrasilly.
4367 2018-07-18 15:51:20 And he still remains the “darling savior” of Houston. What a sham. Shouldn’t expect any less from a career politician and snake oil salesman like @SylvesterTurner

4371 2018-07-18 15:51:13 Too much oil = too much energy
4372 2018-07-18 15:51:13 He's a public representative and using his position as such. How can he justify accepting a very expensive luxury holiday for his family? And what's an oil deal between Sri Lanka and Nigeria got to do with N Ireland or the DUP?

4377 2018-07-18 15:50:41 Oil money.
4378 2018-07-18 15:50:31 @tatcha_v the deep cleanse is a fantastic cleanser but can you change the packaging to give it a pump like the camellia cleansing oil 
4379 2018-07-18 15:50:17 Yes cbd oil is made from hemp. Hemp is a form of marijuana, you get all the benefits except you don’t get high because of it’s very low thc count. Don’t worry it doesn’t show up in your urine or anything.

4381 2018-07-18 15:50:09 How is a carbon market a tax grab??? Companies that use less carbon benefit financially. They could use that to lower prices. It is an incentive and many companies and organizations benefit from the kind of market. Even oil and gas companies are taking advantage of it.
4382 2018-07-18 15:50:07 soooooo, why is our oil going overseas? why does our gas cost so much if we produce more oil then Iraq/Iran? Make Tx great, spread that oil around to the people who really need it.
4383 2018-07-18 15:50:02 some dude is putting olive oil on the statue. This isn't rocket science.
4384 2018-07-18 15:49:58 Hmmm.  So, olive oil eh?  Let's point a camera at the statue and I guarantee it will capture the "miracle" maker.
4385 2018-07-18 15:49:55 So, Iran has done all sorts of things just like other states have done so if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz for all transits if some countries stop buying Iranian oil then this is a pattern. There is no pattern. West wants a pattern to beat Iran with.
4386 2018-07-18 15:49:55 I do have cooking oil to pop them. Any1 wt the corn maize nd l'm ready to pop while we wait. Jehehe
4387 2018-07-18 15:49:34 I actually was just reading a book on U.S. foreign policy on my train ride this morning, which pointed out WW2-era analysis on Middle East vs US oil production capability was largely overblown.
4388 2018-07-18 15:49:26 @SKVERMA1709 @dvvnl_ce_agra1 The main cause is the absorption of the moisture in the oil. Each time the moisture is doubled in a transformer, the life of the insulation is cut by one-half. Failures due to moisture are the most common causes of transformerfailures.
4389 2018-07-18 15:49:13 Uncomfortability and growth are like water and oil, they don't go together.
4390 2018-07-18 15:49:10 Then why the secrecy? What are you hiding? Why are there no transcripts or witnesses? Did you talk about forgiving loans in exchange for oil deal? Lifting sanctions? Money laundering?How did you sell us out? The american ppl have a right to know! You are dispicable!
4391 2018-07-18 15:49:09 We are not oil independent, selling our oil is dumb.
4392 2018-07-18 15:49:08 Playing nice doesn't mean choosing Putin over our own country. Putin wants to take over as many small countries as he can and the United States pulling out of NATO helps him do that. Increasing reliance on oil also benefits Russia, Trump is a lying fool.

4405 2018-07-18 15:48:12 Came to change my oil at the ford dealership and all these old men are so surprised that Im the owner of  a new a car.
4406 2018-07-18 15:48:12 Waiting to have my oil changed. EWTRTW comes on the centers speakers, it reminds me Roland has been gone far too long. I hope you are well sunshine. 
4407 2018-07-18 15:48:11 It's perfectly normal for statues to occasionally weep olive oil.
4408 2018-07-18 15:48:10 It was the Iranians money to begin with.

And now our oil has gone up in price. 

And our word isn't worth shit.
4409 2018-07-18 15:48:10 Try sliced tempeh fried in coconut oil, himalayan rock salt and mix pepper on a bread roll with sliced tomatoes and baby spinach or baby kale(de-storked) #betterthanbacon
4410 2018-07-18 15:48:06 It's body oil from bath & body works.
4411 2018-07-18 15:47:59 My favourite part bout pumping? Applying cool coconut oil on my nipples afterwards. I can literally see that shit melt and it feels like a fire has been put out.
4412 2018-07-18 15:47:57 I don’t understand you “I don’t like cocoa butter” kneegrows—just get you a block of the pure stuff& rub directly& your skin will be gorgeous—but remember,cocoa butter even in its purest form;it’s not non comedogenic—so if you are acne prone,keep it &coconut oil off those areas
4413 2018-07-18 15:47:51 I’m so thankful Nissan don’t require 100 sum dollars for a oil change
4414 2018-07-18 15:47:50 Trump has slapped way more sanctions on Russia is trying to steal business from Russia by telling the Germans to buy our oil, he is making the USA military and NATO military strong how is any of this going to make Russia happy? Open your eyes!!
4415 2018-07-18 15:47:49 I do. I'm someone. And you're just mad because I caught you in your lies, OIL SELLER.

You gave the game away when you claimed to know a statistically improbable number of Model 3 owners, and quoted the American sticker price for a variant that isn't even shipping yet.
4416 2018-07-18 15:47:46 I think you need to read into the topic a bit further to where he was trying to broker an oil deal between Sri Lanka and Nigeria!
4417 2018-07-18 15:47:33 ''Of course! I got a whole crate!''
4418 2018-07-18 15:47:33 Putting oil on my face on a daily has really changed my life. In case anyone needs to know
4419 2018-07-18 15:47:25 tbh do it if you actually really want to but don’t do it on an impulse cause you’ll regret ruining your hair, if u do, put coconut oil on it an hour before bleaching and then bleach over that!!
4420 2018-07-18 15:47:15 Olive oil can give amazing glowing skin and it can also clog pores and lead to breakouts. It all depends on the type of skin you have.

NB: what works for others may not work for you
4421 2018-07-18 15:47:08 Idk whats wrong but i am breaking out like hell and my skin is dry af and at the same time oily. Might be because i abruptly discontinued oil cleansing????
4422 2018-07-18 15:47:04 Is it extra virgin olive oil? Hyuck-hyuck 
4423 2018-07-18 15:46:43 These niggaz that’s changing my oil are from the hood like 3 of them came to my window talmbout “you got that gas” 
4424 2018-07-18 15:46:39 I started oil on water burns with no real purpose but to write some fantasy unb crap but i have no grand plans with the story and idk what to do with it. Its getting boring and repetitive
4425 2018-07-18 15:46:34 Could they be frying with olive oil close by?
4426 2018-07-18 15:46:29 It's not all bad, I can projectile vomit these thoughts on a glorified rock that was tricked into feeling and thinking,

4428 2018-07-18 15:46:26 With oil prices low I do not see Trump backing off in the Iran story. If oil does shoot to the roof he may think differently. Trump wants to punish the Iranians.
4429 2018-07-18 15:46:10 Ouch! I feel u. I had 4 herniated discs after a car accident and made it worse after a sneeze. I'm actually going to the hospital today and being put under for a procedure to relieve the pain. Ice it good. Take it easy today. If u have peppermint oil, dab some on your neck.

4436 2018-07-18 15:45:27 Climate change is a campaign point for the left that is very true.
but only because the right won't support it.
 if they ever did Big Oil would drop them immediately and there goes all their campaign funds.

4444 2018-07-18 15:45:02 any place that is charging you more than 20-30 bucks for an oil change is straight up ROBBING you & I cannot believe people pay 80 DOLLARS to get their oil changed

4447 2018-07-18 15:44:45 Oh!  I have a theory!  Someone is putting olive oil on it so reporters will come and write stupid stories about it.  Free publicity!  Hooray!
4448 2018-07-18 15:44:38 Russian freighters off loading oil to North Korean ships in defiance of U.S. sanctions. This is all we can expect of Trump's backstabbing handelers.
4449 2018-07-18 15:44:37 Ok got you! I detangle with water and an oil before I wash and then finger detangle when I put my product in but I am going to buy a denman to see if that will cut down styling time! I just didn’t think it would go through my hair lol
4450 2018-07-18 15:44:37 About our Russian "enemy" — a third of #EU oil and natural gas imports come from #Russia, which also launches U.S. astronauts into orbit and seeks to quell, not foment #IslamicTerrorism. Ukraine was part of Russia for two centuries. Yet some define friendly talk is treason. Why?
4451 2018-07-18 15:44:34 Hahahahaha it’s fine though! I was MEANT to be raped :) It’s a CHARACTER SHAPING thing, I only have PTSD and dissociative episodes because I haven’t ~let go~! Did you know there’s an essential oil for that?

4453 2018-07-18 15:44:23 So av been blaming my recent breakout on the foundation I just started using. I'm just realizing it was actually olive oil which I also started using recently, thanks to all the ndi YouTube av been watching  (una wehdone) that caused it.
4454 2018-07-18 15:44:23 Even if it did, it’s a hard ask to tell the disabled population to take one for the team when there are so many oil companies that haven’t met the guillotine
4455 2018-07-18 15:44:23 Did Big Oil commission this article?
4456 2018-07-18 15:44:22 That's great! I would love to saute up some garlic with virgin mary olive oil

4462 2018-07-18 15:44:04 Toyota Corolla is amazing on gas. Parts don’t cost much. They’re don’t often give you problems. Just keep up with oil change every 5,000 miles and don’t hit anything.
4463 2018-07-18 15:44:03 It looks more like “snotting” olive oil. Gross.
4464 2018-07-18 15:43:54 Was there another cab at the back to be able to feed the boiler with coal/oil and water  ?
4465 2018-07-18 15:43:45 Pake jagung diparut, Klo bekasnya udh kering pake bio oil aja
4466 2018-07-18 15:43:43 It isn't olive oil. It's the oil mix used to clean the statue.
4467 2018-07-18 15:43:39 Not the best first experience with the @FirstTexasHonda service department when I show up for the oil change appointment I booked online, and there’s no record of it.  Getting scheduled maintenance on a new car should be very easy.

4469 2018-07-18 15:43:29 The first Trudeau screwed up the oil industry with the National Energy Plan. The current Trudeau clearly shows the apple does not fall far from the tree. Soy Boy is totally clueless as to the needs of the oil industry and the good citizens of Canada.
4470 2018-07-18 15:43:22 Morning! Smoothie's debuting his "Thunderstorm Popovers" at the pagoda this morning! He infused Pop Rocks into the fruit for an extra "lightning zing!" Coffee flavors are "Vortex" and "Chock Full O' Oil and Grease" !

She throws one at Sonia.
4473 2018-07-18 15:43:16 That's what I meant by the first sentence. If you add the oil right after boiling the pasta it won't stick together, in my experience it's more effective this way compared to cooking it
(also I love your profile pic)
4474 2018-07-18 15:43:11 Not me! I voted my conscience for a @GreenPartyUS Doctor @JillStein4Prez Then, it was revealed that she also had oil and gas investments!   I realize most people invest in O&G even if it’s only through their employers. #WakeUp #Divest
4475 2018-07-18 15:43:08 oh nice! bro get some coconut oil or argon oil now and your hair will feel so soft and nice.
4476 2018-07-18 15:42:56 I can explain it. Someone is putting olive oil on the statue.
4477 2018-07-18 15:42:56 —Firm skin

1/4 cup of coffee grounds
1/4 cup of brown sugar
1/2 tsp. of cinnamon 
2 tbsp. of coconut oil
(Heat slightly to turn into liq.)

Mix into bowl & use fingers to make small circular motions when applying on your face, neck, and chest for 3 min.
Rinse with warm water

4480 2018-07-18 15:42:31 I have a day off today to be am adult. I'm getting a replacement crown put on this creepy half tooth I've had for months, then I have to see my doctor because my heart did something weird during egg retrieval HAHAHA I'M AGING SO WELL and my car needs an oil change.

4482 2018-07-18 15:42:27 Both Slough appliances along with @FireGerrardsX & @WindsorFS have dealt with a serious fire involving 2 outbuildings, 2 houses & domestic oil tank that had 1500 ltrs of oil in. 6x BA 2xhr & 1 main jet was used to contain & extinguish the fire.
4483 2018-07-18 15:42:25 The epitome of extra virgin olive oil.
4484 2018-07-18 15:42:23 I’ve started putting a face oil or moisturizer on instead of a drying primer under my foundation & my foundation isn’t breaking apart anymore. 
4485 2018-07-18 15:42:22 I’ve used any of their fave washes just the face creams night and day and the oil. I wash my whole body with the sunlight green bae or dove (only when I’m visiting people)
4486 2018-07-18 15:42:17 Virgin olive oil?
4487 2018-07-18 15:42:13 They buy their oil
4488 2018-07-18 15:42:05 and even then, Vaseline works better and doesn’t smell as awful. I once took a bite of some overly vegan dessert that was basically coconut oil mixed with sugar and cocoa and I had mental images of being drowned in carbolic soap

4493 2018-07-18 15:41:44 If I have to heat my home with natural gas when it's 40 below in Alberta, I'm going to burn that gas, or oil, or coal or anything else to stay warm and alive. You goddam SJW climate freaks & Suzuki can piss-off. #cdnpoli #abpoli

4497 2018-07-18 15:41:30 Coconut oil truly changed my life. My hair is softer and I no longer have an attitude.
4498 2018-07-18 15:41:19 I expected you to be smarter than a 5 year old kindergarten graduate.

Are you telling me people who killed in war time in a place that oil tankers were target daily AND protesters and political prisoners Iran kills are the same?

4506 2018-07-18 15:40:56 With or without an abundance of natural gas people can have energy security. In fact we could have more energy security if we no longer relied on fossil fuels, because then we would have more environmental security. Don’t sell out to oil and gas companies.

4511 2018-07-18 15:40:12 I always put a cooking sheet or cardboard under the crankcase breather hose on my Shovel to avoid those oil spills on the concrete, at least for the first few cold starts of the season.

1 tbsp. of coconut oil
1 tsp. of FRESHLY squeezed lemon juice

Mix in a bowl and apply to your face, neck, and chest
Leave it on for 10-25 minutes and remove it with a warm, damp, wash cloth
4517 2018-07-18 15:39:24 Plus the cost.

4532 2018-07-18 15:37:39 For soup, cook ground leek in oil, then simmer with turkey, green curry paste, chicken broth and spinach. Top with orzo.
4533 2018-07-18 15:37:27 That is a fair point that revenue from Kirkuk oil was used to build up other parts of iraq before the pendulum swung the other way. I haven't seen the genetic test results, so not sure if the oil is Kurdish, Arab or Turkomen though.

4556 2018-07-18 15:35:56 Olive oil is optional, adding that after cooking the pasta is still fine. Cooking the oil doesn't add enough flavour to make it mandatory, and is sometimes completely unnecessary (i.e. if you add caprese)

4560 2018-07-18 15:35:45 I agree, and that's part of the problem. The focus is on building the infrastructure to get oil to the consumer. The focus should be on designing an infrastructure not dependent on oil. FYI Passive solar and wind generated electric worked well heating my house in the winter

4584 2018-07-18 15:33:43 2/ Continued to @voxdotcom, fun fact:  all of these senators have oil pipelines in their states that would allow Russia to run crude from Alaska to the Gulf.  THAT’S what that meeting was about.  If you can’t take territory, you use diplomacy.  Anyone else see the deep yogurt?

4587 2018-07-18 15:33:21 Trump did not inherit an exploding oil, gas, coal, and manufacturing job market from Obama. In fact- Obama said those jobs were never coming back (like Putin would hope so he can sell Europe fuel despite sanctions) even though the US is gaining new dominance in those respects.

Trump railed against Germany using Russian oil & natural gas. Merkel/Germany sends billions of $ to Russia. 
Trump has been very harsh on Russia. Trump wants better relations w/ nuclear power. U think it’s bad?

Yemen drones bombarded 
NOW, the headquarters of the Saudi oil company Aramco in the Saudi capital Riyadh.

This is the first time that Yemen drones attack Riyadh.

It's a new drone that can fly long distance, which is called SAMAD.

The name is after President Samad
4603 2018-07-18 15:31:41 Wow. Your parents must be proud of how much you get paid to say this for a living. To hell with the US, right? It's all about personal gain. So much winning. Putin controls est 37% of the oil co Surgutneftegaz, 4.5% of nat gas co Gazprom, & holdings in Gunvor = @ least 40 billion

4609 2018-07-18 15:31:06 and there it is, pretty much proof the genie oil pipeline through the golan heights is real... now isreal declares the heights annexed with congress support and america wont back any UN or Nato intervention because trump has turned his base against them.

4612 2018-07-18 15:30:51 Then don't oppose this legislation - at least - this levels the playing field where the 'oil lobbyist' and the 'homelessness activist' can compete, instead of the latter being silenced by an arbitrary 10% rule.

4624 2018-07-18 15:30:08 When should I get my oil changed?
You should get your oil changed every 3,000 miles or as recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. If intervals are extended, ensure you use oil that is capable of extended mileage changes. Most importantly change your engine oil often enough
4625 2018-07-18 15:29:54 Congratulations Tom!!! Kati there's no stealing 'our' oil
4626 2018-07-18 15:29:45 see the fluoride gets absorbed so you gotta keep a sheen of oil on your skin at all times
4627 2018-07-18 15:29:44 Of course! You're vegetarians. Vegetable oil is made from vegetables. Unlike baby oil.

4629 2018-07-18 15:29:23 Your service department is the worst.  We have several oil changes and tire rotations left on a service plan we purchased, but everyone we have dealt with coming in has prompted us to never, I mean never buy a @Toyota again. You lose customer satisfaction, you lose customers.

4672 2018-07-18 15:24:58 And trust the oil coming in !!! 
4673 2018-07-18 15:24:53 Regularly rotating tires extends their life and improves performance. Rotations are also a good time to check brake condition. You should have them rotated when changing the oil.
4674 2018-07-18 15:24:53 I hate getting my oil changed bc I can always here the guys laughing about how many miles are on my car
4675 2018-07-18 15:24:43 Agreed. They looked like they were plastic and soaked with oil.

4679 2018-07-18 15:24:20 I think I would try to use 80w90 gear oil if I could instead of using 75w140, I think that’s why axles pit cause it won’t mix with water... it’s synthetic
4680 2018-07-18 15:24:19 Venezuela is not a developing country it’s an oil rich country. This is socialism/ communism

4688 2018-07-18 15:23:29 Toomey: "Natural gas is a really good story for us." Now he's calling for more oil drilling in Alaska wildlife preserves and offshore. No mention of global warming. Guess he doesn't get out much
4689 2018-07-18 15:23:27 I don't think anyone is arguing the northeast is a monolith of rich liberals.  Whatever the demographics, deductible high state taxes do represent a cost shifting to states with lower state taxation at the federal level.  But the federal budget is all smoke and mirrors anyway.

4692 2018-07-18 15:23:13 The recent hike in fuel prices was attributed largely to the effects of the exchange rate rather than any hike in international oil prices. This has cascading inflationary consequences for the economy, which eats away whatever income gains people might have experienced #lka

4695 2018-07-18 15:23:02 Just stop subsidizing oil sector.  That would be a good start to begin with.  Pretty sure that if oil is scarce, plastic will have more value, so we won't waste it as much... (instead of buying a pipeline to ease the oil sector)
4696 2018-07-18 15:23:01 Have you had it looked at? My older car used to do this if it was overdue for an oil change, you should wait until the engine is cool and add radiator fluid or water to the radiator.  Don't do it when it's hot or it might boil out on you.

4711 2018-07-18 15:21:29 If I was the president I would decrease military spending by half. Give 100 billion to fund public education

Hell, there have been joint uranium ventures w US companies/Russia in Mongolia pre-1991! No one has ever raised a finger until trying to pin Clinton w nothing burger

4741 2018-07-18 15:18:24 I’m thinking about getting some cookout while I get my oil changed this evening since I didn’t pack lunch lol
4742 2018-07-18 15:18:17 My point was not about the policy (tho I think it’s misguided). Rather, the northeast isn’t a monolith of rich liberals. You make it harder to defeat them when you turn northeastern conservatives into culture war enemies instead of allies

4746 2018-07-18 15:17:55 Damn dude. Just too many nerves in the hand. Years ago I had an "oil change" of the fluid under my kneecap. It was painless, without a local. But sitting on the table with a 4" 10ga needle sticking out of my leg freaked me out a little. Hope you feel better soon

4749 2018-07-18 15:17:38 I add salt and olive oil to the boiling water so the pasta won't stick together, even after adding the sauce for the taste. All people do it.
4750 2018-07-18 15:17:28 Big Oil actively can combats solid evidence of climate change.
Big tobacco fights evidence that it's detrimental to human health.
And the NRA fight any law that might help protect Americans from gun violence. 
They all do what they do just so that they don't stop making money.

4768 2018-07-18 15:16:18 We've had Presidents who start wars over oil (Bush 41), who start wars over false intelligence about WMDs (Bush 43), and who start land wars in Asia (Johnson).  Have we ever had a President who doesn't start wars anywhere?

4785 2018-07-18 15:15:12 Dairy markets are more volatile than oil when it comes to ups and downs. This current down trend has been going on since before trump took office. However, mention his name, his policy and a "might have an affect", and is his fault. Even though it's gone on for years.

4805 2018-07-18 15:13:21 when was the last time you changed it's oil? 

probably isn't related to the heat, just that it's something that needs to be done. the last time i had a clue about the condition of your car was in October 2010 when the oil change sticker said the next due date was 2009.

4822 2018-07-18 15:11:03 I actually need to read extensively about John D. Rockefeller and how he found Standard Oil with Henry Flagler. 

If you don't know, Standard Oil gave birth to (ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron). 
4823 2018-07-18 15:11:03 The longer we give this Russia  story legs the more negative the impact.  
As an energy consumer, I say
let's welcome Russia as a competitor to global energy markets.

This should have been done 25 years ago.  Instead we opted for higher oil prices and a destabilized Middle East.

4825 2018-07-18 15:10:51 If you ask many Democrats why they are against using our oil instead of importing they will tell you they want to conserve for future generations.

If renewables are the future isn't that like saying I want to hoard milk for future generations and I don't care if it spoils?

4857 2018-07-18 15:07:27 They do when they fuck with major oil producers like Iran. Stop pretending you know what you're talking about. The commodities market drastically moved after Trump's stupid Iran games (he was tricked into it by Netanyahu btw who just got caught admitting it).

4875 2018-07-18 15:05:41 I just started using this dry oil that smells like a funeral home but god...I look like a glowing ball of light. I am So. Moisturized.
4876 2018-07-18 15:05:37 I use the LOC method, spray your hair with liquid (preferred spray/water), oil(coconut oil is bad for my hair,I use castor/sweet almond oils)   and then leave in conditioner. I have natural hair, the water bit is not an issue for me.
4877 2018-07-18 15:05:35 Agreed, also interested in developments regarding China and more recently Russia and their involvement with Iran Oil.
4878 2018-07-18 15:05:34 “I think that we as a major oil and gas power, and the United States as a major oil and gas power, as well, we could work together on regulation of international markets,” Putin said. “We do have space for cooperation here.”
4879 2018-07-18 15:05:34 ひどいひどい。とりあえずスキンケアはしてね・・
4880 2018-07-18 15:05:32 Have any European central banks actually agreed to process Iranian oil sales in euros? I remember the idea getting thrown around but most of the banks were pretty wary of it
4881 2018-07-18 15:05:32 Finally got some oil soap for my wood floors. Like look so much better
4882 2018-07-18 15:05:12 Also, is there anything I can do to get my beard to fill in these two patches? A vitamin, a oil, a prayer to the underworld? What’s up
4883 2018-07-18 15:05:09 Nope. 
47% of CT electricity comes from Nat Gas, 49% from nuclear, & 4% from hydro/renewables.  
35% of Connecticut households use natural gas for home heating & 45% use oil.
We don't need more expensive & dangerous pipelines, we need more competition from cheaper #solar & #wind
4884 2018-07-18 15:04:59 I need a THC oil cartridge connect.
4885 2018-07-18 15:04:58 はげ〜〜？
4886 2018-07-18 15:04:56 Let’s not forget his support of Erdogan  regime as well as taking a trip paid for by Erdogan son in law who has made millions from illegal Isis oil trade
4887 2018-07-18 15:04:56 Can't we limit the qty of sugar, salt and oil in packed foods ?
4888 2018-07-18 15:04:54 I seen some turbines in the newspaper catching fire and leaking oil. We need the correct people to take care of climate. When all you do is gouge and we dont see results or employment, we kinda stop trusting you. All your cabinet does is call us names and demean us.
4889 2018-07-18 15:04:46 Made churros bec hungry, pero also got hot oil in my eye lmao aha i succ

4891 2018-07-18 15:04:35 It's odd how medically fragile kids needing cannabis oil are ignored by Georgia republican governor candidates until it's down to the wire for a neck and neck runoff. @CaseyCagle @BrianKempGA #gapol

4894 2018-07-18 15:04:04 sorry mon sa totoo lang si papa talaga dumekwat ng yero nyo, binenta nya yun para may pangbili kami ng white flower at efficascent oil kasi di namin kaya bumili ng food mas okay na yung white flower at efficascent pahid pahid na lang pang pawala ng gutom

4897 2018-07-18 15:03:36 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
4898 2018-07-18 15:03:28 #TerribleTedTalks

Why dumping used motor oil in your alley is the best choice.
4899 2018-07-18 15:03:25 1. Scrub ketiak. Bilas bersih2. 
2. Rendam microfiber cloth dalam air panas/suam, perah & tuam kat ketiak. Repeat a few times. Keringkan. 
3. Sapu extra virgin coconut oil
4. Lap minyak dgn warm washcloth tadi. Repeat sampai puas hati. Keringkan.
5. Sapu whitening lotion.
4900 2018-07-18 15:03:11 Religion and science/logic is like water and oil.
But our beliefs should not discountenance what science has graciously and validly explain.

4906 2018-07-18 15:02:43 Does anyone think Trump doesn’t want any animosity with Russia because of one very important thing:  Oil?
4907 2018-07-18 15:02:31 someone in my public speaking class just did a speech on why u should coconut oil on ur skin i cringed
4908 2018-07-18 15:02:31 Why is that lady from

4912 2018-07-18 15:02:10 I got my oil changed yesterday and today I got a call from the auto shop telling me to bring back my car because they left a tool in it.
4913 2018-07-18 15:02:08 Not our fault their SALT taxes so high
4914 2018-07-18 15:02:06 Coconut oil does!! It takes off all makeup including waterproof makeup! And it’s really good for your skin!

4919 2018-07-18 15:01:28 Again, I believe it is only the immense profitability of Norway’s oil & gas industry (which is fading) that makes this possible. If, for example, an automated workforce produced similar levels of profitability, it could also make sense to nationalize.
4920 2018-07-18 15:01:27 sbb scalp ku oily so if ku cuci belama im gonna lose all that natural oil and my scalp will produce more oil to compensate the oil loss
4921 2018-07-18 15:01:23 Africa is poor because their leaders are connected and controlled by foreign indirect looting rule and oil corporations who owns the media such #BBC #CNN #Washingtonpost #NewspapersOfLies #NewYorkTimes & substations refused&freeze to pronounce the evil activities of their boss.
4922 2018-07-18 15:01:13 Every time he’s on the TV he whacks salt and oil on everything...
4923 2018-07-18 15:01:12 it's good to also recognise what you're putting in WITH a carb, chips have more calories from fat than carbohydrate but are SEEN as a "carb", it's soaking a potato in 9kcal pergram oil and coming to the conclusion that potatoes must be fattening (they're 0.77kcal per gram)
4924 2018-07-18 15:01:08 I can’t stand the smell of tea tree oil.

So oil is you. With that, I say good-bye to you. Enjoy the evolving world of new energy coming your way
4929 2018-07-18 15:00:27 お、よい子はハンターさんに任せて寝る時間だぞ！
4930 2018-07-18 15:00:26 Hubs and I have been discussing this, and can't figure out why the police believe him.
4931 2018-07-18 15:00:15 No Oil Can Boyd?!?!?
4932 2018-07-18 15:00:07 Nice to know one can still find a gusher in Texas.  Not of oil anymore though. Just of bullshit.
4933 2018-07-18 15:00:01 He publicly encouraged Europe to prooduce more tanks and fighter planes and aim them east.  He told them to stop buying Russian gas and oil to take the resources out of the Russian economy so that they can't afford to produce tanks and fighter planes and aim them west.
4934 2018-07-18 15:00:00 I have a SQL backup on hand, Spread the oil it or something?

4938 2018-07-18 14:59:44 L.A. Girl Pro-Matte or NYX total control drop foundation they’re both awesome coverage and don’t leave me oily.. if you’re looking to avoid oil, anything with a matte finish or matte coverage will be your best option..
4939 2018-07-18 14:59:42 Woohoo we made it to 11! Now onto 12 and beyond!
4940 2018-07-18 14:59:31 I don't even bake them with olive oil.
Maybe I just love squash and yams and sweet potatoes, they really don't need any seasoning to me. 
But try it steamed, so good!
4941 2018-07-18 14:59:24 殺伐としてるなぁ
4942 2018-07-18 14:59:21 Put a significant position into $SDRL during the 2014 oil crash w/o a stop loss 
4943 2018-07-18 14:59:13 Yesterday Iran asked the United Nations' International Court of Justice to force the U.S. to roll back trade sanctions, including on oil, imposed after President Trump pulled out of an Obama-era pact meant to curtail Tehran's nuclear ambitions, the court said.
4944 2018-07-18 14:59:12 More downside likely in oil prices
4945 2018-07-18 14:58:44 Come and bite these shell cases like a lawyer nigga find out where you stay and act like we found some oil nigga

4948 2018-07-18 14:58:15 Here is one of your retweets from gross ann navarro

Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
4949 2018-07-18 14:58:09 Show them a way they can make as much money off of conservation of our environment as coal and oil and they might start actually caring about our planet.  Until that happens or all the old congressman/senate die, we are in a uphill battle.
4950 2018-07-18 14:58:08 @JFTVQVC hi Jill could u tell me which  base and top coat u use ? And any other advice ie nail oil etc your nails r amazing many thanks x

4953 2018-07-18 14:57:56 I'm more than a bit dismayed that my boy Ranger Rick is now in cahoots with Big Oil.

4955 2018-07-18 14:57:51 Chelsea would be bankrupt without the dirty russian oil money. I used to love you man but now you are just talking crap.

4957 2018-07-18 14:57:33 Why can you not get over the fact I use a £2.50 jar of coconut oil and healed my kids eczema? You are extreme........it worked and for the sake of £2.50 where is the harm. If it does not work then cook with it, or make a body scrub.seriously you need to get a life.
4958 2018-07-18 14:57:28 Lol I don't cook with butter that often. But I do bake my squash with olive oil. I keep hearing about the steam thing. I also only ever eat it with some tomatoes, mushrooms and parmesan.

Thanks for sharing 
4959 2018-07-18 14:57:28 I just read a tweet by @angelababicz that her dog has seizures and has been out on medication. I just want to share some of my knowledge! Frankincense oil can help support neurological health in dogs!! I can share some more info with you if you'd like!! #knowledgeispower #ithelps
4960 2018-07-18 14:57:27 Not to mention the global damage to every industrial sector (metals, oil, autos, aircraft, farming) if we “win” the trade war with China.  China is finally (perhaps) seeing the credit crunch people have been wrongly predicting for 10 years.
4961 2018-07-18 14:57:06 All the States (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, Ondo, Cross River, Imo, Edo &amp; Abia) in the Niger Delta in Nigeria have crude oil reserves
4962 2018-07-18 14:57:01 *sans rubs his chin* maybe. gotta be some dry storage stuff. having a cooler fulla ice is probably a recipe for disaster and I /really/ don't wanna build a fridge. heh.

4968 2018-07-18 14:56:44 He is a good guy. You guys should really stop trying to bait him. If all this were true he would have Been gone by now. And he is smart not to talk about it during the heat, cause it will just add oil to a small burning flame.
4969 2018-07-18 14:56:43 Kinda surprised as a change of business is in motion but they wanna use their oil and gas revs to build their cannabis business without further adding dilution to their bloated 220 + million share count, could be a unique situation for shareholders
4970 2018-07-18 14:56:31 I love having my brain consist of mainly olive oil

4978 2018-07-18 14:55:46 By far, the worst part of getting an oil change, is being subjected to daytime television.
4979 2018-07-18 14:55:45 Right after he kills Clark people dying is okay. He says Clark will save the world some day until then he needs to hide. 

By saving do you mean the poorly edited beginning at the oil refinery. The one that should have been edited where Jonathan tells Clark to let people die.

4988 2018-07-18 14:54:20 Elizabeth Warren voted to give Trump tens of billions more for the Pentagon war profiteers than Trump even requested. She's dead to me. A militarist society will never end racism or poverty, and it sure as hell can't lead on climate when the Pentagon is world's #1 buyer of oil.
4989 2018-07-18 14:54:01 £:$ rate slid again today. New low of $1.30. Mind you, slid against the € too. Makes exports cheaper to USA & EU but imports more expensive - oil in particular. Expect more price rises soon.

4997 2018-07-18 14:53:35 Just wait until next week when President Yrump rolls out free energy, the democrats will then switch to opposing this because it will hurt oil producing countries.
4998 2018-07-18 14:53:35 Unless someone can prove me wrong with actual proof, I'm beginning to believe that the US Customs clearance for crude oil imports is done at the country of origin before it even boards the tanker. #OOTT

5006 2018-07-18 14:52:02 Car oil change, the aforementioned sweet bun (for me), cigar bar (for him), pick up the kid from Jedi Camp, and hibachi dinner as prepared by our favorite French Canadian Vietnamese chef.

@StopBigMoney It's a NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.

5053 2018-07-18 14:48:07 Ways to box in Putin: (1) introducing the Magnitsky Act in as many nations as possible; (2) lower the price of oil. The Russians are heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues; (3) Protect the Mueller investigation; (4) The Democrats take control of the House; maybe the Senate.

5089 2018-07-18 14:43:22 Also, the American Journal of Cardiology supports the use of olive oil & they probably know more about heart health than you or me. But, I do agree it’s high in calories, but also satiating so you may eat less.

5102 2018-07-18 14:42:10 Also, why is the one guy holding pizza? Why is one drop of oil leaking off, and is there any significance to the fact that there is a bite out of the sode, rather than the top, as is customary???

5115 2018-07-18 14:40:59 So what you're saying is that you value scientific research into seemingly fraudulent cures? I'm glad you have that attitude. Now let's apply it to coconut oil, instead of using logical fallacies to justify a belief that it works without understanding it.
5116 2018-07-18 14:40:57 So how do we counter Kochs?

5135 2018-07-18 14:39:26 We had a really interesting training day at Winsor & Newton talking about lightfasness in inks and a tour of the archives before a session on oils and oil mediums.
5136 2018-07-18 14:39:23 Trump is calling on the rest of NATO to do their part. Trump called out Germany for buying massive amounts of oil from Russia. Obama knew about the meddling and did nothing. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014. We can go on, but your points just flat out stink
5137 2018-07-18 14:39:22 1807199 093920 || ٣٤٥- The oil down the desert way
5138 2018-07-18 14:39:21 This seems very superficial analysis. No mention of the UK's massive war debt burden post 45, the benefit of NS oil or the growth in trade with the US. It also runs counter to recent Cambridge research that argues that membership of the EEC/EU was of marginal benfit 1/2
5139 2018-07-18 14:39:18 Correct. And, "The U.S. is likely to overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2023" boasts Trump.

Probably because he's all appeasin' and stuff.
5140 2018-07-18 14:39:12 Wow ur kinda slow.  He ripped Germany because they were pairing up with Russia and giving them Billions for their oil and then claim they r the enemy. Gave Russia Billions but want US to spend to protect them from Russia!!!   He called out Russia!!!!

5142 2018-07-18 14:39:08 .Isn't it true that the same people who own Monsanto--the wealthiest shareholders--also own the (unlawful, unconstitutional) federal courts?  Remember the dismantling of the entire electric vehicle system in the early 1900s? Indivs got a $1 fine/giant oil corps got $5000 fine.

5149 2018-07-18 14:38:02 Right. That's why they opposed changes after Exxon-Valdez, the BP oil spills, want to bring coal back, etc. Don't make me laugh.

5152 2018-07-18 14:37:40 This thread about to be long af lol but I been watching videos and I watched one for an oil infused shea butter moisturizer and I made it and it works really good if I make a video before you get back I’ll send it to you
5153 2018-07-18 14:37:32 I have been a fan of yours for so many yrs, and was shocked to read that you were going to not sing anymore. I just knew it was one if those ads for skin cream. I was wrong.  It is for cannibus oil.......
5154 2018-07-18 14:37:29 People seem to be angry I don't work a day job, when you have shattered bones it can be hard sustaining a job ,I would rather use cannabis than have pins installed, so my job is innovating hemp carbon tech so your kids have jobs for the next 100 after the oil shit is over...
5155 2018-07-18 14:37:19 Best place to get an oil change? #carmaintenance
5156 2018-07-18 14:37:19 I would have loved to see Dick Pole and Rusty Kuntz go at it. Although, you may have needed to throw Oil Can Boyd in there just to keep things moving.

5166 2018-07-18 14:36:50 Did you misspeak again, you old charlatan? First you say Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election, then you backtrack and say you misspoke and that you believe our government intel. So which one is it you snake oil salesman?!?
5167 2018-07-18 14:36:48 Watching a guy painting walls with oil base, windows sealed, no mask, and smoking a cigarette is asking for an early death. I instantly got a headache and walked in for 5 min
5168 2018-07-18 14:36:46 There was never a threat of war, nor would he dare. Russia's GDP is $2 trillion as compared to our $20T. If our allies could be persuaded to support us after your insults, Russia would be crushed by not only arms but they'd never recover economically. They rely on oil exports.

5170 2018-07-18 14:36:33 @HHShkMohd @kbsalsaud Eventual war against Qatar will last for next 100 years, also high oil prices.

5172 2018-07-18 14:36:29 Then On Coming Europe&amrkica Deals,they Will Go To The Account Of oil Deals
5173 2018-07-18 14:36:12 I think you should practice what you preach and give up all oil products. That includes all synthetics and all plastics, as well as all products delivered by planes, trains, trucks, or modern ships. Only products delivered by draft horses and wooden sailing ships may be used.
5174 2018-07-18 14:36:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
5175 2018-07-18 14:35:58 But long story short my natural hair is really wavy and it’s just demosturiZed because I don’t take care of it. & she told me if I wanna restore my 4A pattern don’t use any products just water, oil and shea butter and I’m like interesting.

5178 2018-07-18 14:35:49 Will you answer a questionnaire about how much the gas and oil industry controls you ? Also do you support Trump's plans to further slash Medicare and Social Security ? The seniors who built this state would like to know ?
5179 2018-07-18 14:35:42 Nothing wrong with that, but it’s a far cry from complete government control, & the oil industry’s contribution to GDP is important to highlight.
5180 2018-07-18 14:35:41 Anyone know any good places i can go get a oil change?
5181 2018-07-18 14:35:36 Agreed. If they had given up OG and another 1st as well, that's to steep for  a one yr shot that may not even work. This is more than reasonable.
5182 2018-07-18 14:35:33 #EIAReport: U.S. crude oil imports averaged 9.1 million bpd last week, +1,635,000 bpd vs previous week; last 4 weeks crude oil imports

5185 2018-07-18 14:35:22 Right ...... there is enough food for everyone. It’s not equitably distribute. Not sure what you disagree with me about here. We don’t have to life in a world where you have to have oil to eat.
5186 2018-07-18 14:35:21 I always need a oil change at the most inconvenient times . 
5187 2018-07-18 14:35:20 Fats, including olive oil, not healthy.

Some caveats:
--EIA has been rounding off last sev weeks. So we went from 10.9 for lots of weeks to 11.
--Weekly figs are *very* shaky - and get revised dramatically when monthly figs come out.

5195 2018-07-18 14:34:33 It was a Standard Oil cartoon reference. The octopus is a longtime symbol of monopoly.
5196 2018-07-18 14:34:32 Those countries in Scandinavia are literally living off oil money through capitalism. They can only redistribute for so long. That’s why they are on a downward trend and their debt is skyrocketing.

5199 2018-07-18 14:34:08 The small % is VERY vocal, while, as my dad used to say the squeaky wheel get's the oil.  Most of the majority are busy with their lives so they have not paid attention to the agitators' victories.  Now, it's too much so they try to fight back, but it's also a lot to overturn.

I guess this is obvious.  Just a random thought.  Carry on...

5284 2018-07-18 14:29:26 @SecretaryPerry You are correct about proper SPR use.  Ineffective for mogas price drop. We are still overstored to the 10 yr avg for oil.  You want to cut gasoline prices?

5410 2018-07-18 14:17:01 @FixMyHog Harley seems to have a history of weak oil pumps. I hear horror stories of engines freezing up... I'm worried about my 2017 Street Glide Special. What are the early symptoms? What should I do to fix it before I suffer $$ engine failure?

5412 2018-07-18 14:16:54 I just slathered tea tree oil all over my face
5413 2018-07-18 14:16:50 @StuartMaconie Oil is a chemical. Oil refinery is a specific kind of chemical plant. You are correct, sir  :)
5414 2018-07-18 14:16:44 mist is just a spray bottle lol not an oil
5415 2018-07-18 14:16:43 EXACTLY.  These poor people who think Trump gives 2 sh*ts about anything other then his own self promotion. He would sell every single one of his followers (and the U.S.) out to make $5. Snake oil salesman of the highest order #PutinsPuppet #TraitorTrump
5416 2018-07-18 14:16:28 うさぎが首をフリフリしながら走って私のところに来る姿が本当に可愛いんだけど、そういう時はたいがい何か悪さしてごまかそうとしてるのでうさぎ、侮れない。
5417 2018-07-18 14:16:28 Had a great interview with Amanda Brock of Solaris Midstream, talking about #ProducedWater Management at the @UnconventOilGas Water Sourcing Conference for the @OfficialOGGN Oil and Gas #HSE Poscast. #OilandGas
5418 2018-07-18 14:16:13 @BBCRadMac Stanlow is both a chemical plant and an oil refinery. So you're both right.
5419 2018-07-18 14:16:12 sunflower oil = 45 % vita E and heals better in one day than og cocoanut oil had in 8 weeks its 4 bucks!! bc the demand isso down im glad that the orginal brand i buy of co oil was out or else i never woulda got it
5420 2018-07-18 14:16:12 Public figure do me a favour sit on a comic programme next to olive oil think that gives you some cred  pop. Eye ???
5421 2018-07-18 14:16:03 We are not forcing you to be here? Pull the troops home? Will be difficult though to get all the oil etc in the Middle East. 
5422 2018-07-18 14:15:42 That's true for the Russian elite who have become wealthy beyond all expectations. But avg Russian hasn't seen much improvement - more goods on the shelves, less repression. But economy is still not good and based largely on oil & gas. Putin appeals to their national pride.
5423 2018-07-18 14:15:39 We wouldn't want to forget the Highland clearances, the North Sea oil border being moved south so that Scottish oil falls into English territory, industry in Scotland being closed down and sold off by Thatcher Scotland being used as a Guinea pig for the poll tax

5424 2018-07-18 14:15:38 Try super moringa oil. Malamig pramis mahamot. 
5425 2018-07-18 14:15:28 I guess that takes 'burning eyes out with hot oil' off the menu then.
5426 2018-07-18 14:15:27 Well we have our own oil to deal with and when we can’t clear it we are subject to the same economics as others - it’s not a joy to deal with right now
5427 2018-07-18 14:15:25 Oil fried kebabs? Only bangalore has that :(
5428 2018-07-18 14:15:22 Wake up....Russia has been providing NK with the technology to build missiles and nukes, plus they are providing oil and gas to them on the side?  Put sanction on Russia for attacking our election!
5429 2018-07-18 14:15:21 I'm sure Qatar will set you up with some quality stuff as long as you keep pushing their oil.
5430 2018-07-18 14:15:09 ほしい！
5431 2018-07-18 14:15:08 The oil company threatened competitors. And they made sure they were in control of the entire production chain
5432 2018-07-18 14:15:06 but I don’t see saturated fat to be something to worry *too* much about. A tablespoon of olive oil has more satfat than 100g of pork chop and all my V friends go through a helluva lot of EVOL (and avos  2% satfat. Same as some lean beef cuts)
5433 2018-07-18 14:14:45 Not really. The emissions from the the trains Diesel engines is replaced by the emissions from the turbine engines that pump the oil through the pipeline. 

Pipelines are only slightly safer than trains.
5434 2018-07-18 14:14:40 U dont hv to be petty bout it.... That just shows tje level of her maturity.... Just luck up n chop ur life dey go.

5437 2018-07-18 14:14:22 Ya'll funny man. lol. Bimmers are hella reliable, its just that more kids who wanna drift and not maintain buy them then sell them busted. Or some rich lady who just graduated and became a paralegal and didn't bother to change the oil or put premium gas in it.
5438 2018-07-18 14:14:10 You can't pump solar panels out of the ground. The oil companies killed the solar industry through Trump and against Obama. Big oil is concerned like big coal. They don't want to feel the pain Trump is inflicting upon farmers and businesses tied in with his tariffs.
5439 2018-07-18 14:14:04 Of course he got a long well he's trading American foreign policy for oil money.
5440 2018-07-18 14:14:01 That is more a reflection of ‘Dutch disease’ (concentration of wealth in specific industries, in this case, oil) than much else.
5441 2018-07-18 14:13:59 i make rosewater in a mist form and spray it on my face... but i never heard of rose hip oil. gotta check it out
5442 2018-07-18 14:13:55 I use to put a curling smoothie on my hair then use the gel but I figured it just wasn’t a good combination but this time I just sprayed my hair with water & blackcastor oil & then applied the gel & it started flaking.

5450 2018-07-18 14:13:07 Promised myself I would spend no more money this week. Then my gas light and oil change light comes on this morning 
5451 2018-07-18 14:13:07 Bit dewy-eyed of you given that oil and gas production including fracking come with a huge amount of waste and environmental cost and so does nuclear. To this day we don’t know how to store tired reactors safely.
5452 2018-07-18 14:13:04 Why coconut oil explains steamed cauliflower
5453 2018-07-18 14:12:58 Wonder if Chelsea, back when they first started spending rubles, or City, with flowing oil money, counted the net spend? I know we nearly were bankrupt but times have changed. Don’t care about net spend anymore just trophies and points, looks like loads of both ahead for LFC!
5454 2018-07-18 14:12:44 Thanks Jamie.

With UKOG tankering oil off site at Horse Hill today and potentially Angus re-injecting waste water nearby too this is starting to look a bit worrying.

I think it certainly warrants  further scrutiny by regulators and all works stopped until review is completed

5457 2018-07-18 14:12:07 The idea the USA has to talk with Putin because to controls 45% of the global nuclear arsenal is hogwash....unless he wants to see Russia and everyone else destroyed. What Russia has is a lot of nuclear waste, oil and gas....a an economy smaller than Spain's.  
5458 2018-07-18 14:12:06 Shite #Stainlesssteel oil tank removed from #Sportster chop. We're not lucky enough for the replacement oil tank to bolt straight in of course. I'll look to sort out some mount for this tomorrow.

The second gulf of Tonin incident (leading to the Vietnam war wasting a whole generation of young people) was made up, and the Pearl Harbor attacks are self-afflicted by invading their oil embassy within their terrain.

5464 2018-07-18 14:11:25 They are really trying to get the most out of this "Real Wages" chart... it has become a political talking point and showing up all over the place.  

There is no context given with the chart...  but make no mistake, the 2015/2016 surge of real incomes was due to the oil crash.
5465 2018-07-18 14:11:16 Still sent arms to Ukraine, wants Germany to buy Texas oil, etc..

5479 2018-07-18 14:09:48 Correct! Instead the oil business cartels of the West helped the Shah to take control. Our Western intelligence services replaced a democracy with a monarchy. The Shah repressed and killed 1M Iranians and there came the Islamic revolution, the Ayatollah and rest is history!

It's not the purest product.
and just because we found it in hemp first doesn't make hemp the best source.
5494 2018-07-18 14:09:00 Ever done business in Russia? I have it's a nightmare to get a visa let alone a trade deal. Plus their economy is tanking (look it up) all they have is gas & oil. They have nothing else to offer. This is level of wishful thinking that got us into this position

5513 2018-07-18 14:06:21 1. Montenegro has no oil assets.

5520 2018-07-18 14:05:57 So when wipe it with olive oil, do you have a separate place you keep it so the olive oil doesn't get on other things?

5533 2018-07-18 14:04:52 You should try using grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil helps get rid of acne and there are other many benefits about using grapeseed oil as well!
5534 2018-07-18 14:04:49 I've always used organic argan oil or organic olive oil in my hair after washing it (sometimes I also do a hair mask with those oils). The results are always impressive,

5546 2018-07-18 14:03:36 No, people lost their minds when Trump pushed NATO countries to meet their 2% agreed upon obligation for their own defense spending, while also pointing out how stupid it is to pay billions to Russia & becoming dependent on Russian oil & gas.

Honestly, why is that an issue?
5547 2018-07-18 14:03:35 So I just wash it sans soap when the skillet is slightly warm (and if shit is caked on, I use salt as a scrub to get it off). Then I heat up the skillet to get rid of excess water and wipe it down with olive oil once the water is dried up to make sure the pan doesn’t dry out!

5550 2018-07-18 14:03:23 Damn,  I learned gun safety as a small child. Stories like this should never happen. Never point at something you do not intend to shoot. Treat pistols, rifles and shotguns like they are always loaded. My brother was shot with an “unloaded rifle”.
5551 2018-07-18 14:03:12 The people that could set up Niger Delta Avengers to destroy the Oil pipelines, you can't put anything pass them. PDP and their sympathisers are hardened criminals, nothing patriotic about them.

5566 2018-07-18 14:01:54 I'm against tariffs, but how much of these proposed car price hikes are actually the manufacturers being opportunistic?
Every time there is a story about Middle East oil prices going up, gas prices go up the very next day. Later oil companies announce record profits!

5603 2018-07-18 13:57:34 Still trying to understand what is wrong with pushing the richest NATO countries to increase defense spending, while also criticizing them for paying billions to the Russians & being dependent on their oil & gas.

 It's like pushing your kids to eat their veggies... Tough love.
5604 2018-07-18 13:57:20 Trailblazers are sweet! Let’s compare... my windshield leaked every time it rained, it burned oil religiously... and the floorboard on the passenger side would get so hot the carpet would start steaming (ya know, from the rain...inside ) omg I loved it!
5605 2018-07-18 13:57:17 Industrial hemp CBD oil is the same thing as psychoactive cannabis (marijuana) CBD oil, and it's federally legal - although CA recently banned (wtg CA ). It's legal because industrial hemp has only trace amounts of THC where marijuana  has high concentrations.
5606 2018-07-18 13:57:12 I have no complaints.  The Oil and Gas industry has provided me the opportunity to spend time on every continent but Antarctica, filled a lot of passport pages and introduced some fantastic friends. That's the benefit of working in L&D - you have to get right into the mix.

5632 2018-07-18 13:54:15 Thanks Steven - any idea what might be causing them?

5633 2018-07-18 13:54:13 City would be in the Championship without oil money.
Liverpool have been a massive club for 60-70 years.

City can’t even sell out their home games.
City buy players with dirty oil money.
Liverpool sell to buy
5634 2018-07-18 13:54:05 If the who climate change issue & debate was co-opted and taken over by oil & gas and industrial monopolists long ago, wouldn't that increase your skepticism about what is truth vs. deception?

Muka berminyak yang even hydration doesn't help much, try astringent toner. Usually ada label 'oil control' or 'astringent'. Aku suka toner yg ada witch hazel.

5648 2018-07-18 13:53:20 Big moves are followed by long periods of consolidation. I would stay away from oil for a while.
5649 2018-07-18 13:53:12 I think he’s working out debt problems for one thing, Eric Trump has admitted that. Kushner also needs help financially.  Putin wants Sanctions lifted, oil is Russia’s principle resource.  Maybe Putin will put on a Parade for Trump

5674 2018-07-18 13:50:45 Ive been using the Garnier whole blend Olive Oil. Wow was my hair soft after it. Amazing. I use castor oil on my eyelashes and eyelids. Ive seen that Shea Moisture line. I think I tried a product or two. I liked it.
5675 2018-07-18 13:50:44 @PlanetRockRadio @DarrenPRedick Stone Temple Pilots took their name from the STP oil brand apparently and looked to find a suitable phrase to fit the letters.

5679 2018-07-18 13:50:38 India is already buying oil from US & trimming trade surplus will help India win a possible exemption on US tariffs on some products. Must discuss throughly on US, has a long term relations with Israel. Can't avoid old frnd Russia. Hot & very hot line discussion with top brass.
5680 2018-07-18 13:50:37 Hows he doing that? Just this past week he encouraged NATO members to stop buying Russian oil and to bolster their militaries to ward off any potential Russian advances in Eastern Europe. I'm failing to see how that's handing Russia anything

5686 2018-07-18 13:50:12 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings.   Opposing Energy East and Transmountain = killing #LGBTQ. @HalifaxPride

5816 2018-07-18 13:36:08 I know quite a bit of people who've had success in using CBD oil. It's great for anyone needing pain relief without the psychoactivity of THC. So if someone needed the pain relief but didn't want to test positive for THC during a job hiring drug test, then CBD is your go-to.

5824 2018-07-18 13:35:30 Saudi Royalty emails me every other day begging me to take their oil for free but the drums must take forever to ship. They’re sure I’ll have it soon they tell me, after I give them my social security number for postage.
5825 2018-07-18 13:35:30 Without doubt #UKOG will be well worth buying now for new highs. Great news more oil, light sweet and gorgeous.

5827 2018-07-18 13:35:28 Pearl Harbor was not even an attack. It was a retaliation  attack  because the U.S.A. put an oil embargo on Japan so they attacked back. Let's get History straight and not play so innocent all of the tiime.
5828 2018-07-18 13:35:26 I’d like to see evidence of that as well. Union membership was actually understated (in Norway  it’s close to 80%), but the 50% state ownership makes no sense, unless it’s industry-specific (as in Norway’s oil industry).
5829 2018-07-18 13:35:22 Your argument is fallacious. No one pro oil and gas supports damaging the environment.  In fact the mines that provide the materials for Prius batteries are an environmental disaster. Oil and gas sites can be remediated.  Anti-oil dillusionally believe we can stop using oil now.

5840 2018-07-18 13:34:17 Sis complaining about waiting for 30mins on an oil change.. I’ve been here for almost two hours waiting to change the bulb on my headlights 
5841 2018-07-18 13:34:11 #MagnitskyAct and #Oil are the two issues to watch.
5842 2018-07-18 13:34:03 We can’t get our oil across Canada, our PM made a mockery out of us in India and then they pissed of japan and Australia by showing up late and now you make this kind of statement, time for your party to smarten up I would say, I don’t think you’d have the smarts to do it
5843 2018-07-18 13:33:57 This olive oil has really helped with my hair growth 
5844 2018-07-18 13:33:53 “Trump & Republicans gave huge tax cuts to big drug companies, big oil and other corporations, but corporations are giving back little—if anything—to working families. In fact, 433 corporations out of the Fortune 500 have no plans to share their tax cuts with employees.”
5845 2018-07-18 13:33:53 I personally have had 4 engineers who worked for me get oil and gas jobs again after they we laid off. 
Low skill work may be hard to find and may never come back but skilled oil and gas workers are doing better.

By next summer that pipeline will be half done.
5846 2018-07-18 13:33:51 Yup. And now its shifted back east just as quickly after force majeure on Zawiya yesterday and lifting it in oil crescent. And round we go.
5847 2018-07-18 13:33:34 We don't have oil but we have other minerals,how do you think motsepe and Ramaphosa got rich? And FYI ramaphosa may not be the one who pulled the trigger but we know he ordered the hit...we've seen the emails it's public information  he's Cyril killer
5848 2018-07-18 13:33:32 You don't really need to change the oil in your car. Runs fine if you don't.

Now if you'll excuse me I need to find what that clicking sound is.

5854 2018-07-18 13:33:05 Agree coal and oil are finite energy resources wastful and destructive to the land with no hope of repaiation afterwards. Wind, solar, and water if done with mindful ethics can sustain the native American people with jobs energy and a sound economy.
5855 2018-07-18 13:33:03 Oil it all over with EVOO and rub it in well then stick it in your oven for an hour at like 400 and bake it. Then let it sit and cool before you touch it. Cleaning is as simple as wiping it down with a towel since the oil made it non stick. Use water sparingly; NO SOAP!
5856 2018-07-18 13:32:51 First of all, Tucker, your son isn't going to war any more than you or Trump went to war. Secondly, America only goes  to war to defend oil fields and corporate interests.

5861 2018-07-18 13:32:17 Russia has wanted the breakup of the EU, wants to dissolve the WTO and United Nations.  Wanted the Iran Deal done, torn up,why? Because it would raise oil prices, this give them hard cash that they desperately need because of sanctions.

5871 2018-07-18 13:30:45 So they discussed how US and Russian businesses could work around the Magnisky Act (the sanctions) so the US oil exploration companies can transfer experience and technology and extract Russian oil from the Arctic...

5874 2018-07-18 13:30:24 We just need to diversify the economy and stop depending  on oil, Nigeria is blessed with alot of mineral resources and we have very fertile soil to farm on, everybody want easy money and we so much depend on government instead of being creative for sustainability.
5875 2018-07-18 13:30:17 Difficult to reconcile with much of the debate in the 70s.  Odd not to see a reference to North Sea oil which was the great facilitator and disruptor too...

5880 2018-07-18 13:30:07 Westminster get more from Scotland's oil than is given back to Scotland and a lot of Scottish exports go as English exports as the goods go out via English ports. Personally I would suggest you check your facts before chatting crap.
5881 2018-07-18 13:30:06 Yeah i does happen. Just give them water, remind them you are there with them and give them something minty, sea tea, the candy, or an essential oil

5888 2018-07-18 13:29:33 Cheryl. You are spreading lies.  My spouse who worked in remediation, included spills and leaks stated that bitumen is easier to clean up than most other petroleum products.  Straight oil is the worst.
5889 2018-07-18 13:29:31 Or you can believe his actions of the last 19 months :   arming Ukraine, sanctions, calling Crimea annexation illegitimate, killing Russian soldiers in Syria, increasing oil/gas production. Open your eyes, Joe. His actions a far more important than his words!
5890 2018-07-18 13:29:31 Way to go, John! You represent a state that just happens to have a lot of oil underneath it. You did absolutely nothing for this to happen, but don’t let that stand in the way of bragging about it!

5924 2018-07-18 13:25:16 In Australia at the moment. Government here still trying to muscle through new coal mines – and on a huge scale; backslapping each other over new oil off WA. Now *that's* crazy.

5932 2018-07-18 13:24:20 @JillWineBanks No one seems to have listened to Putin's words regarding oil. Said Trump and he agreed that oil prices should not be allowed to plummet. Why should it be pumped if they could not make a profit? Was this evidence of collusion as U.S. has no interest in Russian oil?
5933 2018-07-18 13:24:18 Idk where all of Pennsylvania’s tax revenue goes, but it’s definitely not into fixing the roads I almost gashed my oil pan open on this bum ass shit

It should develop.

This leaves 85% to 90% of the oil to devastate and kill wildlife. It will render the area completely inhabitable.

6077 2018-07-18 13:09:56 I’ve discovered another great use for my TLC Manuka whipped cream - Cleg bites! Clegs are horrendous this year and I’m being bitten alive when with my horses. I applied a drop of tea tree oil into bite followed by 2 applications of cream and you would never know if herb bitten.
6078 2018-07-18 13:09:52 Can't have anything to do with shooting down an #airliner, poisoning people with #Novichok, or propping up Assad and murdering women and children to prop up the price of oil, or even mocking us for his Winning the #RUSSpublicanPresidency.

6082 2018-07-18 13:09:39 Take the oil pipeline from Germany to Russia for example.  By opposing it. . . Trump is severely harming Russia AND Germany also.  But you have given Trump a license to do this because it hurts Russia and puts America first (not Germany first).

6207 2018-07-18 12:57:28 That’s an interesting question. Why did Jesus ask his disciples to stay awake. Proper hermeneutic on this one needed as the theology also important (the watchman... oil lamps are comparative passages). It was it just Jesus humanity and he needed his friends?

6209 2018-07-18 12:57:15 Why are gasoline prices increasing when we have plenty of both oil and natural gas. We should have a government program to switch a number of current vehicles to natural gas. Perhaps start with trucks or buses.

6358 2018-07-18 12:42:49 Especially when you note that there are few petrol stations in much  much of anglophone region. Limbe, which hosts the oil refinery SONARA, pays higher gas prices than Yaounde. Management of these oil resources are a very significant factor in this crisis.

6383 2018-07-18 12:40:57 @ShashiTharoor Do you seriously believe that you are so important that the PM of this country is answerable to you for some miscreants pouring oil on the name board of your office, even if they are bjp workers?

6495 2018-07-18 12:30:03 I’ve been going to that particular one since I was a child, with my dad. I went there several years ago again with my dad and there was an elderly Greek man there selling olive oil and cucumbers who told me he remembered me as a child at the market. I’m going off track now

6498 2018-07-18 12:29:41 Yeah just what the planet needs right now.  A fkn oil pipeline from the tar sands of Alberta.  Let's just run the planet into the ground like a $500 Datsun.
6499 2018-07-18 12:29:32 Exactly! Even if they "have control," they don't have the knowledge to match Exxon, Conoco, Chevron, BP or any of the other  Heavy Crude processors, they've pretending to replace in the Orinoco Oil Belt -much less "sobar una burra" Jaja!

6501 2018-07-18 12:29:26 That didn't look like the US & Russia getting along. That looked  like .@realDonaldTrump carrying Putin's water.  Trump policy has helped Russian econ as they have incr. soybean production 2 replace the US farmer. US oil consumption has risen since 2017 which helps Russian econ

6507 2018-07-18 12:28:52 Getting my oil changed and the guy started my car inside the garage and everyone in the waiting room jumped because it was so loud

6517 2018-07-18 12:27:53 For five long formative years I had a spoonful of cod liver oil inflicted upon me every day. Now they say it's no use and doesn't work.

6521 2018-07-18 12:27:26 @NewDay  let's make it clear first off the oil deal was done in a better time with Russia, and Trump did not make NATO step up to pay more they are and continue to follow the arrangements in the deal towards 2024!

6524 2018-07-18 12:26:44 Is that why his family leaving us Indiana taxpayers with over a 21 million dollar cleanup of their oil company?
6525 2018-07-18 12:26:40 Turns out cod liver oil isn't good for you after all! Always thought something smelt fishy...

6537 2018-07-18 12:25:30 Even that doesn’t work! Our pup was on one when he was bite by a tick & got Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever this year. Luckily he is okay, but we’ve started spraying him with something made with peppermint essential oil, I’ve heard it helps keep them off people too!
6538 2018-07-18 12:25:26 Interesting. Quite a number of my patients have been advised by their Ophthalmologist or Optometrist to take Fish Oil supplements for dry eyes. It appears this practice has seeped into eye health without significant evidence 
6539 2018-07-18 12:25:15 tomorrow i’m gonna do a fat fast to get into ketosis quickly so that means only 2 avocados and one tbsp of coconut oil
6540 2018-07-18 12:25:06 @andalounaturals Do you use palm oil or any of it's derivatives in your products?
6541 2018-07-18 12:25:06 1/ Why do I think that? Because of the irrational nonsense spouted here. Not ready to believe people are actually this clueless. My denial strategy is to prefer to believe this is nonsense paid by the oil and weapons cartels to continue the misogynist, racist division plan.
6542 2018-07-18 12:24:58 Use oils like almond oil, olive oil and jojoba oil to balance the oil on your skin , sounds insane but it seriously works and mosturizes your skin really well

6556 2018-07-18 12:23:45 Honestly if I don't reply you,then just know you're stupid and dont warrant my reply.
6557 2018-07-18 12:23:33 Stand firm on Iranian sanctions! Let US oil exports fill the needs of Europe, China and India.  It helps the US economy, helps the US trade deficit and stops Iran oil sales money  killing US soldiers and  Israel's citizens.

6562 2018-07-18 12:22:49 I wanna be able to just put coconut oil on my face in the morning and that's it
6563 2018-07-18 12:22:47 Oil cleanser, simple face wash, gycolic pads, some salycylic or retinol serum, eye cream and then a 50 SPF and honestly doesn’t make a difference.
6564 2018-07-18 12:22:44 You think buffalos bad with big trucks? Wait until you get into the oil and gas capital of the world
6565 2018-07-18 12:22:42 2267 is for Dimethyl Thiophosphoryl Chloride, which is an additive for oil and gas
6566 2018-07-18 12:22:31 that should get that oil leak sorted 
6567 2018-07-18 12:22:19 Same tankers as on UKOG website from when oil left last time 
6568 2018-07-18 12:22:14 where  can i get the oil?
6569 2018-07-18 12:21:57 Just got told to get off my phone and actually talk by 2 complete strangers. I am in a waiting room. Ladies I’m sorry but I’m not here to make friends I just want my oil changed.

6572 2018-07-18 12:21:52 All happened under Obama, what did Obama do to Russia? He thought  Hillary would win, so he did NOTHING! He never supplied Ukraine w/  needed weapons, Trump did. He pulled missiles from Poland, Trump put  them in. Shut down oil exports helping Russia, Trump opened them all up.

6577 2018-07-18 12:21:26 I especially like how he sent tanks to Ukraine (instead of blankets like Obama) or how he bombed and killed 100’s of Russian mercenaries in Syria..or how he pressured OPEC to ramp up oil production to hurt Russia’ economy..yeah..real asskisser!
6578 2018-07-18 12:21:11 The world should try to be less addicted to plastics... One day we'll have no oil any more. I think it's very important to be independent in most regards. Elektrical power, transportation (Germany needing oil from for example Russia...) and many others.
6579 2018-07-18 12:21:03 Guess which country is about to pass Iraq and Iran in oil production? Actually it's not a country at all, but a state that used to be its own country -- Texas.

6588 2018-07-18 12:20:05 Going 4ward, the oil revenue will only be enough for maintaining the office of the President and 5VPs, pay war debts, army, cabinet members; very few tenderpreneurs. There will be nothing left to pay 4 you and me, build the roads,schools,hospitals,clean drinking water #SouthSudan
6589 2018-07-18 12:19:59 I thought you said you had a talk with the Saudi’s to increase oil production, why haven’t gas prices come down? Blah Blah Blah is all that comes out ofyour mouth!

The US embargo on Iran oil shipments has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a quandary. If he plays along, India could find itself on the right side of President Donald Trump on trade but lose cheap supplies and precious foreign exchange.

6600 2018-07-18 12:18:01 Chop everything for about 1 minute and when the mixture starts to be homogeneous, add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and add salt. Help yourself with a spatula to mix the sauce and then continue to blend until you obtain a homogeneous mixture of light and bright green
6601 2018-07-18 12:17:39 BKP took the oil from the original HH flow tests.
6602 2018-07-18 12:17:32 All ppl has to do was listen - I mean really listen and not vote with their bias because a snake oil salesman said what they wanted to here - they’re great and the victims and everyone is bad and to blame

I’m a fan of oil pulling(google it)& nasal cleansing(neti pots) However somethings are not meant to be multitasked. Suffice to say the ensuing sneezing fit & spewing of coconut oil on the bathroom mirror tells the full story #justsaying #HomeopathyWorks #whoiscleaningthisup
6605 2018-07-18 12:17:07 . That sounds like trump. Coal is a dead issue. Robotics is doing the jobs people do. Solar has more jobs than oil and coal combined. Now, the orange clown has added a 30% tariff on solar panels. #ConMan #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
6606 2018-07-18 12:16:59 I come to get an oil change at 7 am so that it doesn’t affect my work hours and it’s going to affect my work hours. 
6607 2018-07-18 12:16:44 He's a character.  You can still see him out and about at the local crab houses.

I'll oil the mitt up tonight. 
6608 2018-07-18 12:16:40 Diplomacy. Trump's not going to go full Bulldog on Pooty right off the bat. The sooner we find out what countries in #Europe will buy oil & natural gas from #USA vs. #Russia the better. Europe should buy from us. We'll find out who's friend or foe. #maga #trump #RussiaSummit
6609 2018-07-18 12:16:35 Did you read the article and not understand it or are you just spreading propaganda for the oil lobby? The cars don’t pollute more the way we generate electricity is the culprit. This is a great argument for renewable energy Not gasoline engines LOL
6610 2018-07-18 12:16:34 Well.. if you’d explained it was a cream and not an oil then maybe I would of took the advice
6611 2018-07-18 12:16:34 Oil just dropped more than 10%
6612 2018-07-18 12:16:32 Real wages are not increasing. Layoffs are taking place at companies that will be impacted by tariffs. Yield curve is giving pause. 

You’re a snake oil salesman, not an economic genius. Too bad your pawns over at State TV aren’t calling you out.

6635 2018-07-18 12:14:55 I mean boom. Literally, boom.
6636 2018-07-18 12:14:45 No. Only part of the Trump-infused Republican party (albeit a large part) believes a “deep state” exists. The far leftward Chomskyite fringes of the Dems, Green Party, etc are more of the belief that foreign policy is controlled by corporate interests (ie “no blood for oil”).
6637 2018-07-18 12:14:35 #MSMN as from both RNS’s today and yesterday here is what to expect in next 2-4 weeks .. Arkoma Oil and Gas flow rates .. Welch workover wells ..

6650 2018-07-18 12:13:16 Good stuff.  There is an ordinance in our town I believe that says cars have to parked on non-permeable, which makes no sense.  Probably did when cars leaked oil everywhere but that is no longer the case.

That’s what annoyed me. CBD is CBD. It doesn’t matter what plant it comes from, what it’s meant to achieve is the same.
6659 2018-07-18 12:11:47 Has cooking oil got an alchol content?

6708 2018-07-18 12:05:38 Trump must have something on and in Syria, because Putin has been slavering for control of that state for a LONG time. Most likely the oil fields.

6760 2018-07-18 11:58:24 It is preferable to the interests of Western Gov'ts to leave Assad in power.

6779 2018-07-18 11:56:07 You cannot refute @realDonaldTrump has done more to the Russians than anyone in placing sanctions on Russia & closing Consulates, extending the NATO missile defense to Poland, and addressing EU's dependence on Russian Oil & Gas, giving them needed capital. This sound ship sails.

6791 2018-07-18 11:53:57 If he’s our enemy, why is Germany Doing business with them & some other NATO country’s also, so let me get this straight, We pay money to NATO to defend from Russian aggression, BUT Germany buys 70% Oil from them, Looks like Germany is #Putins Puppet #MAGA
6792 2018-07-18 11:53:54 Saddam was a US agent. You do know the CIA paid him a salary? That he followed what the US told him. The US saw a chance to make a profit by attacking Iraq and stealing its oil. And it was Kuwait and SA who made Saddam attack Iran. Without them he would not have had the resources

6831 2018-07-18 11:49:07 during the military offensive, the dam sustained heavy damage from coalition airstrikes. 

Syrian government should let the curds starve! They depleted all the water reserves to steal the oil in DZ and the dam is barely working.
6832 2018-07-18 11:48:43 I promise you I love food more but it’s small tweaks like thin crust instead of deep dish pizza, bake instead of fry. Water instead of juice. Less oil in everything. And small small it all adds up.

6843 2018-07-18 11:46:35 @Ianjohns3839 regarding your fish oil study- do you realize that there is a FDA approved Omega 3, EPA only drug, called Vascepa?

Your study is very misleading, as it groups OTC fish oil (crap) with high grade EPA, like Vascepa, for which there is evidence of success - JELIS.

6915 2018-07-18 11:38:54 Comply with oil and chemical storage regulations - use spill pallets to save spills  and prevent clean ups

6918 2018-07-18 11:38:28 The oil will not dry, it may just become worthless and we would be forced to diversify, hopefully our diversification would not be all dependent on government but the ordinary citizens finding out new ways to use common natural resources to create huge wealth for themselves.

6922 2018-07-18 11:37:46 Nobody has said you are using oil money, but buying players at this inflated cost may eventually leave you wanting oil sheikhs to buy your club eventually. You need a goalkeeper, that we agree but spending 75m for one surely is too much. My only prayer is that he saves you 20pts
6923 2018-07-18 11:37:42 I’ve been investing in the OTC for more than 10yrs. I have every right to help hold a publicly traded startup accountable. My fortune came in 2010 when I owned tens of millions in EVXA and MOPN and were contracted by govt to clean oil spill. I’m more patient than you think. 
6924 2018-07-18 11:37:39 Gareth with a silly shirt, is asking if I'm smoking...when he's sweating marijuana oil from pot smoking...

No I have not been smoking... that's an insult

6935 2018-07-18 11:36:33 Interesting; there is a lot of discussion on Omega 3/6 ratio & how it is getting out of wack with increasing amounts of processed seed oils in the diet, a lot of ppl try & boast Omega 3 via fish oil but there is probably no substitute for cutting the inflammatory Omega 6s
6936 2018-07-18 11:36:31 Fry it with olive oil still it's light brown and use for your hair... It works

6944 2018-07-18 11:35:52 Can't we assumed the oil has dried and find the bearing?
6945 2018-07-18 11:35:50 There's a busker singing 'All You Need Is Love' and I can say with some certainty that John Lennon is spinning so fast in his grave that he might as well be boring for oil.
6946 2018-07-18 11:35:48 No,we hate the fact that our so called president is a liar who tells lie upon lie and makes up facts to stroke his fragile ego. Let’s see how successful your bullsh*t tax cut is when folks start paying more for food, oil and get kicked off health care. You WILL die in jail.
6947 2018-07-18 11:35:27 i would guess the chemical weapons were from the chemical plants built by the british government, whilst there was an Oil for Food embargo..HIGHLY ILLEGAL..and only admitted to, when the directors of the companies were standing in the dock at the old baily..MI6 M'lord..

6963 2018-07-18 11:33:07 Few outside the US are aware the type of people who sit in America’s congress, their level of ignorance and corruption, both parties but in particular almost all Republicans, owned by the Israel lobby, owned by Wall Street, owned by big oil and defence.
6964 2018-07-18 11:33:04 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President: If Russia can cut-of interest in U.S. Treasuries as it has done it can as easily cut-off German oil/gas to control U.

6999 2018-07-18 11:29:13 Did you know that the oil industry is heavily subsidized? Billions/year of tax dollars are given out and they still charge $1.3/L at the pump. We should not be supporting these oil companies it's not just about a car, it's about using green energy and living sustainably.

7067 2018-07-18 11:21:44 Majority contraband goods entering the country are unfit for human consumption, Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) confirms. KAM says the illegal imports make up 52% of the market share. Most affected goods include spirits & other fast moving goods like cooking oil & sugar.
7068 2018-07-18 11:21:38 Olive oil is produced in mainly temperate arid climates, not the tropics. Coconut oil has far inferior yields, which would lead to greater impact on forested areas. Don't know much about Jojoba. Given that palm oil is here to stay, we must do all we can to produce it responsibly.
7069 2018-07-18 11:21:23 Russia needs something other than oil to depend on for economic growth.
7070 2018-07-18 11:21:11 Starts at 15.36 for anyone else who wants to listen :) peak demand for oil in 2036! So at least another 20 years of rising demand before other sources of energy stabilise demand for oil! Crazy!

7084 2018-07-18 11:18:35 Why are you concerned about subsidies for renewables and not those to coal, gas, oil? Investment in lowest cost renewables lowers prices for all.
7085 2018-07-18 11:18:22 The smooth sweet creamy taste of hydrogenated oil in @MiracleWhip does it for me.
7086 2018-07-18 11:18:07 Wait, you are saying the US is has been innocent over the last 300 yrs of not destroying countries for oil, overthrowing govts to establish a central banking system the US controls and lobbying against regimes the US didn't agree with?

7089 2018-07-18 11:17:30 There was no oversight of pricing on contracts for sale of Australian minerals, gas, oil etc, there should have been a huge bounty recovered on every $ of product exported, to support Australia into the future.

7121 2018-07-18 11:14:05 It’s arguable though because the vat we cook chicken in is the same as the one we cook fish in. When the vat is filtered all the oil all goes to the same drain pan so all the oil is mixed together, making it potentially haram as all the oil is used again

7187 2018-07-18 11:05:44 Increases in oil (because you pulled out of Iran deal) and increases in manufactured goods like cars (because you pulled out of trade deals) - so middle class and poor are paying for the tax cuts for the rich. Middle class can't afford your tax cuts.

7189 2018-07-18 11:05:41 I wonder how many people take it just for heart health though and there is some evidence that cod liver oil is good for other things. Also, for those that don't like fish, it's a very cheap way of getting some good fats into your system.

7204 2018-07-18 11:04:33 And if we'd voted for "independence" we would have oil at $28/barrel so no oil income, no currency, no reserves, no central bank, no Barnett fiscal transfers, inherited share of UK debt and out of the EU. Brexi, which I agree is a disaster, is a picnic by comparison.

7210 2018-07-18 11:02:54 I was wondering the same thing!! Dr. Bronner’s replied to one of my tweets and said the palm oil they use is produced on a farm that doesn’t cut down any new land, they just keep reusing the land they’ve been using, but it’s definitely something to think about and look into

7246 2018-07-18 10:56:42 The first leg of the move is probably the ETF, part of the second leg was IMO the TARP and QE in 2009-2010. 
I think the start of trading in OIL contracts had a similar effect.
7247 2018-07-18 10:56:21 And when did westerners learn to be moderate?  LOL.  Another reason I say just avoid oil.  All you have to do is go on a couple FB vegan recipe groups and watch the videos.  MASSIVE amounts of oil.  Better to avoid.

7265 2018-07-18 10:54:00 Obama's leg work did wonders.  The oil industry is another unsung hero.  We should dump the strategic oil reserve down the pipeline.  Our whole country is a strategic oil reserve.  Putting hundreds of billions of soybean in reserve ,corn too.   grain corn into ethanol is nutz.

7269 2018-07-18 10:53:10 Bullshit! Money is money. That's why the sellers of City players accepted the money. Stop having a diminished capacity brain still talking of the old phrase of oil money. You cannot buy a goalkeeper for 66m yet you have a shity defense.

7308 2018-07-18 10:46:08 I feel like the real reason we don't invest into renewable energy is because we like having interests in the middle east for oil, and so we have "official" personal reasons to jump into war and regulate other nations.

7618 2018-07-18 09:55:40 I guess @realDonaldTrump arming Ukraine against Russia (something obama wouldn’t do) means he’s controlled by Putin? 

Or maybe 

Trump exposing the corrupt multi billion dollar oil deal between Germany/Russia means he loves Putin? 

Facts > propaganda
7619 2018-07-18 09:55:00 Tehran wants the German Bundesbank to transfer billions of euros to Iran to help it sell oil to India. The EU also wants European central banks to wire euros to Iran to keep the nuclear deal alive. #Iran #nuclear #EU #Germany #Trump #deal #Bundesbank #financing #euros #oil #India
7620 2018-07-18 09:54:54 I'm sure the oil on my face will be enough to fry the 4 eggs

7622 2018-07-18 09:54:35 For example the Brexit. Trump is putting oil on it all. If there would be re-election now in the UK with main topic the Brexit, I know for sure 90% of the citizen of the UK wants to stay within the EU. People like Trump have reaon to fuck up the EU. Bad for world peace!!!

7654 2018-07-18 09:49:00 I rather surprised myself with the way that I painted this last oil. I didn’t deliberately change my style, but it’s just the way it went. The paint and brushes just rather took over. I’m not displeased with the outcome, it’s just not what I expected

7659 2018-07-18 09:48:18 Thanks, hadn’t seen it yet. Inflation has been trending down since Nov 2017 so it was to be expected. I would have waited a bit longer though, oil price is trending down at the moment and that may impact the Kwanza which could affect inflation. Still, local economy needs help.

7676 2018-07-18 09:45:40 we use imported fresh potatoes, we use expensive centrifugal Fryers that reduce fat, and low cholesterol oil. In my opinion our Fries cannot be compared with theirs. Finally they are a giant franchise. That’s why Mcdonalds can sell a burger for 3 riyals.

7899 2018-07-18 09:03:41 If data is the new oil, locking it in a safe and pretending it is gold isn't going to realise any value for anyone. It needs to be liberated from silos and flow freely. #NHS #GDPR #DataProtection #OurNhsOurData
7900 2018-07-18 09:03:29 yes, this is very true. Potentially a little leftover oil. In ours, we used to cook legends less regularly so they were always super fresh and hot. Loved working on chicken sides. Just sang about snack wraps to the tune of Akon's Smack That.
7901 2018-07-18 09:03:18 There's a lot to be hopeful about when you zero in on the human potentials that we have not yet unlocked. NE, SE, NC, NW, SW, SS...Each with a unique set of capabilities and comparative advantages. OIL is not the decisive currency. It is HUMAN CAPITAL.

This is how they used their freedom and western aid: to have a huge number of child and to save them from a certain death. Colonialism is the reason why so many black and arab people are alive.

When we learn to walk onr two feet as our 'grandfathers' did and some of our 'fathers', then we will reap far more than what was lost from destruction

8162 2018-07-18 08:16:27 #oott  will wti going to tank bottoms and potential for persistent backwardation spike incentivise producers to use the new proposed houston oil contract ?
8163 2018-07-18 08:16:08 Hipsters never deny themselves. In Denmark, there is now a hipster trend to inject oil into the body to get bigger muscles, with major health consequences. Just stereotypical that these hipsters have tattoos over large parts of the body #stupidity
8164 2018-07-18 08:16:06 Why does pouring olive oil sound like someone is masturbating with too much lube?? Because I can’t work out if this is a cooking show or porn. And Martha sure looks young
8165 2018-07-18 08:16:06 Its so weird that we have still not gotten an official report from the oil company or anybody concerning the tanker that blew and took lives.
8166 2018-07-18 08:15:43 I absolutely have. Go back and read the revised gers figures where they reclassified off shore oil from 'other' to 'Scotland' they don't do this for current years. Only past years, its better for the papers that way...
8167 2018-07-18 08:15:35 Vidi se ako te ne mrzi da tražiš ali jasno je i bez toga. Linkovan je NYT koji na tom mestu kaže: "But his father, who worked for the state-owned oil company, and his mother went into exile after running afoul of the regime". Radio na pumpi a onda se suprostavio režimu.

8172 2018-07-18 08:14:52 Jul 18 - Global economic slowdown is likely and necessary later in 2018 ... No one likes to predict recession, but the global economy is likely to experience a significant slowdown before the end of 2019, and the slowdown may be necessary to relieve upward pressure on oil prices.

8300 2018-07-18 07:48:36 Only God knows how much of our sweet oil has melted to bribe these shameless gathering called @IntlCrimCourt @USEmbassyAbuja for hosting a mass murderer who killed 1000+ of Nigerian Shia Muslims, women children,buried alive in a mass grave @Amaka_Ekwo @UN @hrw @zinadabo @Qamvar
8301 2018-07-18 07:48:31 I think this qualifies as drilling for oil in a national park.
8302 2018-07-18 07:48:22 Have to wonder about the 'Two Lives of Dali Mpofu'

And the one who will willingly give away this entitlement and live on Government land.

8303 2018-07-18 07:48:12 So day three of only washing my hair weekly with sulfate free products and it’s not too greasy still to be honest. Less so than when I used to add oil after washing to reduce the frizz. Still 4 days until I wash it again though so could still get gross!
8304 2018-07-18 07:47:54 this is the simple reason I don't oil my face

The middle man is not happy with Russia or Trump.

8313 2018-07-18 07:46:31 no so true, with trade wars it s reversing slowly . And contrary to some thinkers. Low price of crude oil  is not good for the economy. And since lotus mingles with crude oil price   not good.
8314 2018-07-18 07:46:25 ใครเปนอะไร ?
8315 2018-07-18 07:46:12 Sad, but a vegan menu restricts your clientele.  And vegan cheese is full of coconut oil- so unhealthy.
8316 2018-07-18 07:46:12 Russia is slowly imploding due to its chronic economic mismanagement and outright theft, and the only thing that's propping up its economy is decent price for crude oil. 

We all know what dictators are prone to doing when their domestic support begins to waver.

8332 2018-07-18 07:42:40 Thanks @talygarntom. What I want is a gently rising oil price. This tends to favour efficient, low cost operators with newer fleets eg RYA, EZJ and slowly ramps up the pressure on legacy fleets eg Alitalia, Swiss etc
RYA is my 2nd largest holding

The only reason it didn't completely bury Alberta is the price of oil out-paced their stupidity. They are responsible for fucking up the province, but not fixing it.

8368 2018-07-18 07:36:02 These protests about things which no one actually has much control over really perplexes me. I suppose the end goal is to be featured on Al Jazeera and hope that OPEC lower the price of crude oil?

8436 2018-07-18 07:22:34 Iraq has time and again in its history as oil producer been a modern Venezuela or how would you call the time of Saddam earning billions from oil sales while the rest of country plummeting into poverty?!

8458 2018-07-18 07:17:54 You’d checked the oil, it was just the sensor.
Yet, what if you’d lost oil while driving? You’d not know of the new problem, because of the faulty sensor. So, he was right!

On a lighter note, are you looking for more things he can tell you off over?

8552 2018-07-18 06:59:56 Absolutely. 
Data like oil, can vary in quality. 
And quality is often affected by the pipes through which it flows. 
And we have a lot of legacy pipes in the NHS which compromise every drop.

8555 2018-07-18 06:59:02 I wanna share this for girls who feel like their skin needs some love or a change of skincare routine.

8559 2018-07-18 06:57:46 @KaakakionAIT Good morning, please tell your speaker, thanks guy from the Niger Delta and APC claiming that the south south governors are making money from taxes of oil companies. He needs to know that company income taxes are paid to FIRS  and not the individual state
8560 2018-07-18 06:57:42 I added some oil to my soap and used an exfoliating glove on my sore muscles and the aching started disappearing instantly #IDoesThis #Herbalist
8561 2018-07-18 06:57:12 I want to make some edible butter, and oil, and cook with that shit.
8562 2018-07-18 06:57:07 Coconut oil can actually be drying for some people
8563 2018-07-18 06:57:00 Seems quite cruel as I'm drinking my morning marijuana tee extracted/decarboxylated to coconut oil.
8564 2018-07-18 06:56:44 I recommend you read Ale-Ahmad’s Gharzadeghi, or Westification as it translates I think.  You may learn something about the world, and your overpriced, useless weaponry which you guys spend your oil money on.
8565 2018-07-18 06:56:22 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
8566 2018-07-18 06:56:20 Not at all. It’s a light oil but if you’re worried just apply to the tips.
8567 2018-07-18 06:55:35 I always worry coconut oil will make my hair greasy  I have oily roots and  dry lengths. Do you find it makes yours feel heavy/oily?

8570 2018-07-18 06:54:07 Well, I am sure it is more complicated than that. But it is worthwhile asking: who benefits from these wars? America? Okay, who in America? Steel workers? Teachers? Who? So far as I can tell it is the shareholders of oil companies and weapons manufacturers like Lockheed-Martin.

8574 2018-07-18 06:53:45 Coconut oil works well on mine (fine, wavy)
8575 2018-07-18 06:53:40 No. If the oil windfall had happened under Yeltsin, the energy oligarchs would have kept it, offshores it, leveraged it 30-1for global business empire-building, and lost all in The Crash. And Russia would have been destitute, just like in 1998-99

8581 2018-07-18 06:52:07 Today’s Thought For The Day #r4today. Water is good. If there was more water in the Middle East and less oil, people would be happier. Don’t ablute near a river. Don’t hose your lawn thoughtlessly.
8582 2018-07-18 06:51:59 my scalp itches but the only oil i have is supposed to be used to help thicken hair & God knows that the last thing my hair needs to do

8588 2018-07-18 06:51:22 I think the issue is not our inability to exploit our resources but the barriers of entry to high value commodity markets like oil & minerals. The bulk of graduates in Africa are either looking for blue & white collar jobs and entrepreneurship is for tech or agriculture (easier).

8597 2018-07-18 06:49:52 I showed the jiffy oil in the new pss video too. I am obsessed w/it & the pencils, and the ink index. I genuinely love working w/all of them and they helped me achieve results I’ve always hoped to get in digital. Can’t go w/out
8598 2018-07-18 06:49:47 Just listened. Well done you! You made a lot of really good points in a short time. Best one about the oil/petrol import from the middle east. Ppl need reminding of that one.
8599 2018-07-18 06:49:44 Yes, in the same way that used motor oil is an alternative to margarine.

8605 2018-07-18 06:48:02 Add that to the fact that oil and gas are not part of our future and Russia has very little to fall back on. While the US and Russia are playing  their power games, the rest of the world is moving on. I already don't use fossil fuels for transport or electricity.

8616 2018-07-18 06:46:41 We should also be building nuclear power plants, clearly superior to gas / oil / coal. 

Climatologists are largely in agreement about that, I do think wind and solar are scaling pretty quickly, although government subsidies would help a lot in parts of the West.

8630 2018-07-18 06:43:27 You really sound like a jack leg preacher selling fish oil. There’s no way, ABSOLUTELY NO WAY you actually feel the way you speak. Stop with the propaganda.
8631 2018-07-18 06:43:24 Agree let's get something to work with for now; something that brings a degree of certainty for business. Bear in mind that Norway is oil rich. That's how they manage such high levels of prosperity with so few people.

Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

8663 2018-07-18 06:37:12 If we are getting oil from Saudi Arabia it comes in ships. Why would it be put in a pipeline in the US when it could just be shipped to Russia..... I don't get it.
8664 2018-07-18 06:37:08 As long as the UK is one of the highest donor to the ICC there will be selective justice because it is UK that has been a cover for the genocide and mass murder happening especially in Nigeria. As long as the oil keep flowing they don't care what happens to the indigenous people
8665 2018-07-18 06:36:48 That is because of our commitment to global climate change policies. And because some of us feel we don’t need to sell our resources ASAP. The oil will still be there in the future and most likely we can sell it for a better price. Patience is a virtue. HaHa. #cdnpoli

8705 2018-07-18 06:29:07 Right! It'll take a while longer than that to phase oil relevance out globally. But the competition for what's left of the oil market share will not support the entity called Nigeria.
8706 2018-07-18 06:28:53 Oil price drop will pi$$ Putin off ...
8707 2018-07-18 06:28:47 I’m solidly on the fence. I don’t want to punish Alberta as it’s my own country but I don’t trust oil companies will do right by the environment. I want to create jobs and have Canada prosper but not at the expense of land and ecosystem.

8719 2018-07-18 06:26:50 Russian oil is also purchased by the UK and other NATO countries. Your focus on Germany is what threw me because it carries the significant burden of being *our* front line. The US isn't in a posit'n to replace Russian oil in Europe. Tankers crossing the Atlantic wouldn't cut it.

1) If you power your EV from solar it changes everything the article states
2)Many power Cos benefit from aux solar production. That means less reliance on fuel to power the grid.
3)No smog checks on EVs. Why do new gas powered vehicles need that?
4)No oil change

8748 2018-07-18 06:20:01 I read somewhere that the wealthy & powerful deniers know perfectly well that climate change is happening & that humans are causing it, but that they are pleased because the melting polar ice caps mean that they can drill for oil more easily in the north.

8751 2018-07-18 06:19:31 I am with you on your thoughts. Cut off their manhood in full glare of public, fry their manhood in oil and show the rapists of their manhood being fed to dog's. Will be a big lesson for anyone who gets such thoughts of playing with a female's vanity.

8779 2018-07-18 06:13:45 #peaceistheprize Syrians are returning. Oil is being pumped by US, Saudis, and Russia to collapse oil prices for Iran and let's keep our eyes on Venezuela. Shipping pollutes. Tariffs are arguably sustainable.

8837 2018-07-18 06:03:32 Also, I hate how people say africa is poor, it isn't poor, the land is fertile and has tons of oil, diamonds, gold, silver, copper, uranium, platinum, iron, ect.  The only poor thing about it is the people who cant manage it, it's like giving a 2  year old a BMW, he can't use it.

8883 2018-07-18 05:53:17 Yeah it seems. Palm oil one of good oil of India. Olive oil is not based Indian climate and it cannot be suitable for all climate. This is all business strategy to fill asian market. We use groundnet oil, coconut oil, palm oil as appropriate for receipe. Thats it.

9021 2018-07-18 05:28:26 Thank you ! & Jamaican Black castor oil works pretty good ! When I first went natural , I was doing a lot to my hair simply because I felt as though it was extremely short and I didn’t like it. But once you obtain some length, it’s best to do protective styles.

9099 2018-07-18 05:14:25 I think we need a heartbreaking picture of a turtle that has been poisoned by a mix of motor oil, tire and brake pad residue, salt, and whatever else is washing into our waterways from highways & cars.

9102 2018-07-18 05:13:35 My defense I told my dad when the first oil light came on and he just said okay so figured if he wasn’t worried i wasn’t.. but don’t worry Papa Karhoff fixed everything car didn’t blow up 
9103 2018-07-18 05:13:34 we are fast approaching hyperinflation.
our economic system is a dinosaur.
oil has to go the way of the dodo or we die.
it is as simple as that.

Exfoliating is very crucial to making your lips super soft. It gets rid of dead skin and cells. You can use a new tooothbrush to gently exfoliate in a circular motion or you can make a lip scrub. Mix sugar and oil. You can also buy one if you want.

9115 2018-07-18 05:11:25 Personal opinions aside regarding certain general aspects of Saudi regime/history, I can unbiasedly state my support for recent progressive changes, albeit certain controversial methods. Shifting away from oil based economy and granting increased personal freedoms is refreshing.
9116 2018-07-18 05:11:03 Putin is in effect ANOTHER oil cartel.  His resources that can take away from our trade revenue in many ways financially and otherwise I think are more volatile.

9126 2018-07-18 05:10:11 do u think there’s a facebook group for oil rig workers with posts like “advice for when ur just not feeling the vibe?”
9127 2018-07-18 05:10:10 Why should we pay to protect Germany when they do not pay; do not invest in military and make deals with Russia as only source for oil?
9128 2018-07-18 05:10:00 Is olive oil olive oil
9129 2018-07-18 05:09:49 Weird logic by opposition parties and Muulas against TT bill do not criminalise it as ex Husband goes 2 jail &Who would take care ex wife. How it is in case of Hindu men arrested in dowry act?Why apply oil on Muslim's dump wife? @rsprasad @Swamy39
9130 2018-07-18 05:09:24 Why not build Canadian refining capacity rather than billions to build a pipeline that will do nothing to increase our domestic supply of oil?
9131 2018-07-18 05:09:19 To be fair: who the fuck cares about the opinion of an oil industry robber-baron?

9139 2018-07-18 05:07:31 I agree times are changing but not yet unfortunately.  Oil is still a valuable commodity.  And if you think your govt give a damn about ISIS or 'brown people' you're deluded.  Look at who you elected!

9143 2018-07-18 05:07:05 Start with an oil cleanser on dry skin to melt away makeup, then a low ph foam cleanser to clean your skin. After that a hydrating toner with hyaluronic acid and other Humectants to attract moisture.

9146 2018-07-18 05:06:37 K. So. Town of 700. Two hours drive away is a bustling metropolis of 15,000, which also has a collapsed oil economy. 3 hours away is a boom town of 30,000, but they're the oil hub for ND and aren't hiring because there's like one job for every 10 people.

9148 2018-07-18 05:06:20 Of course, but you see times are changing oil and coal companies are laying off even crude oil is collapsing. Times are changing, your excuses are invalid, we will eradicate ISIS regardless of your outcry.

9230 2018-07-18 04:53:50 If the exfoliating wash has those beads in it that might be the culprit, or if the clean and clear moisturizer is “oil free” that could be taking a toll too. Also the heat been heavy lately

9257 2018-07-18 04:49:26 I gotta disagree.  The libs have made terrible decisions.  They aren’t planning on expanding oil production.  They are decreasing it.  They are increasing taxes or passing legislation that hinders growth.  America is projected to be exporting huge amounts of oil.  We aren’t.

We are quite deserbingly reliant of the U. S. in BC for our refined oil needs.

Why are American funded ENGO'S fighting to landlock OUR resources?  
Why is America emerging as the top exporter?

Why we all pay the price for the SAudi to isolate Iran?!!

9387 2018-07-18 04:25:53 I hate the oil based heat protectant I have been using the last few months. I feel like it just cooks my hair and I hate how it feels when I spray it on. But I hate wasting products.
9388 2018-07-18 04:25:38 If why reduce our whole Body by the 70% of Water,
it only takes Pressure and Time and why become Mineral Oil, and we could serve the next Species.

I knew "oil" fires did this. But 12year old me, didn't think wax did.. Yup. It does. Just. Like. This.

to consume every day!
InshaAllah we can do it!
9417 2018-07-18 04:21:16 Those that can, do. Those that can't, teach. Right? Unfortunately "learning" from these snake oil salesmen is to a founders detriment.

9422 2018-07-18 04:20:50 I think any one would have predicted this. The USA acted alone. Such a deal Trump is going to get us. Iran will sell lots of oil, the price will drop- sounds good-but the stock market does not like oil too cheap, nor too expensive-even Putin acknowledged this fact at the Summit.

Trump told Germany that it’s not a good idea to buy Russian oil and gas.
He has sold Ukraine 60 billion in arms.
He got NATO to put in 70 Billion more in their defence.

Actions speak louder than words and his actions have shown us exactly who he cares about. Think about pushing Germany to not use Russian Oil, or pushing EU to better their troops against Russia. Or the Sanctions. THIS is what you look at. Not his flubs.
9567 2018-07-18 03:57:55 My 5 year-old son, changing the oil in the Yak this morning, stopped, cursed that he'd left a cylinder drain open, and then turned to me with a Pall Mall dangling from his lips: "Dad, this is the last time I'm changing the oil in this Commie heap. You're as bad as Trump."

Pale light seeps in through the window above my bed. Cool sheets drape the body and a dog paws at the door to venture out. 
A delicate and albino layer secrets the ground away while the trees enjoy their naked form.

9576 2018-07-18 03:56:10 The government shouldn't "support" renewables in the first place. They should just tax carbon to internalize costs.

The point of a carbon tax is to make the playing field fair so that an oil corp can't try to compete by not paying for the handling of their emissions

9592 2018-07-18 03:53:52 December 7, 1941—a date which we should blame both on both sides. I mean, what were we thinking with those oil embargoes? Tojo was very strong and extremely powerful when he says they didn't do it. Could have been a 400 lb. guy with an aircraft carrier, how can we ever know?
9593 2018-07-18 03:53:44 i just styled it while wet & i put motions styling foam in it then did the bantu knots and then i separated it with oil on my hands

9656 2018-07-18 03:46:50 Russia is only kept afloat by high oil prices.  At $30 oil, they would be bankrupt, couldn't afford their military, and the Russian people would be in revolt.
9657 2018-07-18 03:46:43 A long and bright future for oil sands production over the next decade according to IHS Markit. Kevin Birn will be joining us on the Oil Sands Conference Main Stage in Sept. It will good to hear about this report first hand!

9670 2018-07-18 03:45:18 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9671 2018-07-18 03:45:12 ウナギの養殖って確立してんの？？
絶滅危険度でいうとかなり低いランクらしいじゃんね。
9672 2018-07-18 03:45:03 Yeah but it's magical olive oil.
9673 2018-07-18 03:44:59 how do u get eyelash extensions off?? ive tried baby oil, coconut oil, steaming them and nothing works
9674 2018-07-18 03:44:55 I think we had like 4 but we don't usually use them because we always use salonpas or some random Asian oil pain killers

9677 2018-07-18 03:44:34 Trump's team met to collude with Russia at Trump Tower, hid the multiple contacts, lied about their purpose, then tried to say they were nothing once their lies were again exposed.
For an old lady, you certainly need to grow up & stop believing the snake oil salesman is honest.
9678 2018-07-18 03:44:33 I'm sure it is a distinction in the culinary world that I am simply too plebeian to understand, but it genuinely cracks me up when recipes call for "good" olive oil
9679 2018-07-18 03:44:31 Yes! Olive oil is such a versatile cooking oil and can be used with just about any cooking method. Doesn't hurt that it makes dishes a hundred times yummier, too! 
9680 2018-07-18 03:44:25 But we are not the problem when Germany is importing 70% of their oil from Russia. This is a global problem. We can do some things and I agree on some of what I say except for food because then you are hurting innocent ppl
9681 2018-07-18 03:44:10 No.

Not, just, olive oil . . .

Extra  Virgin  Olive  Oil !!!
9682 2018-07-18 03:44:02 In Buffalo Ny the smoke shops sell the CBD oil.
9683 2018-07-18 03:44:01 I don't know what it is, I just hate when people try to sell me stuff. Like all this self business oil/wellness/skincare crap. All of it. Just makes me mad. Lol. I just feel like people aren't really doing it out of good intentions. They just want to money.
9684 2018-07-18 03:43:55 わかります、わかります( ´∀｀ )
9685 2018-07-18 03:43:53 Acrylic? Use a gloss medium. Oil, no freakin' clue.
9686 2018-07-18 03:43:53 Oil ready to get hammered
9687 2018-07-18 03:43:53 I've gotten mine to be less cranky by finding a moisturizer my skin likes. Over cleansing dries it out which makes it also produce more oil. Or, the quick solution is to just remove it altogether. Skin is overrated.

9695 2018-07-18 03:43:12 So clever. Spot oil would be >$100 were it not for US production.
9696 2018-07-18 03:43:11 個人的には、完全養殖できるまで待てないんかーってのはある

完全養殖できたら、うなぎ食えるしうなぎ取れなくなっても放流できて保全の面でも上手く行くやもしれんし

うなぎという食材を消し去りたいように見えるのも何か気になる
9697 2018-07-18 03:42:57 Why do my toes smell like lavender lemon oil only when I remove them from my feet
9698 2018-07-18 03:42:55 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
9699 2018-07-18 03:42:54 Someone sent me a snap of an Alaskan Oil Spill shot tonight...instantly got a headache, hangover, and vomited in my mouth a little...

9701 2018-07-18 03:42:42 Putin wants his oil money is why. Browder is responsible for the Magnitsky (sic) act. And Pootie is pissed.
9702 2018-07-18 03:42:40 Also the sheer idiocy of her being married to my uncle (who is not white) and yet being a raging racist....he's rich from his job in the oil industry and once he got his he completely abdicated from any responsibility as a citizen. So they're a perfect match.
9703 2018-07-18 03:42:36 I’m sitting here trying to do a google search on how I can get paid to put oil on models but it keeps bringing up cars.
9704 2018-07-18 03:42:32 Commercial breaks on Hulu ain’t all that bad. It gives my mind a break to think about other things like when I need to change my oil, and why is the sky blue

9710 2018-07-18 03:41:07 My dad’s coworkers at the LSU Vet School many years ago would recommend summers eve douche. Which still entertains me. I think the acid in the vinegar helps break down the scent oil.
9711 2018-07-18 03:40:58 this might be weird, but what about a cookie with:
semi-sweet chocolate (chunks)

9712 2018-07-18 03:40:56 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
9713 2018-07-18 03:40:56 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9714 2018-07-18 03:40:42 Guess #Putin instructed #Trump to tell #Germany to stop buying #oil from #Russia and start buying oil from #America. Very curious.
9715 2018-07-18 03:40:29 Too much oil in yo throat

Who are you to talk shit to anyone about anything?
9722 2018-07-18 03:39:27 You’re already in a globalize country. It’s too late. Be as sovereign as you want you still depend on other countries and vice versa, there’s no getting around that. Stop accepting oil from Canada and the Middle East and see what happens to you inside of a month LOL
9723 2018-07-18 03:39:25 And he was gonna get back at us when we asked the Saudis to lower the cost of their oil to break Putin after he invaded Crimea.
9724 2018-07-18 03:39:23 人間の消費、河川沿岸の環境の変化、海流の変化あたりよねー

9734 2018-07-18 03:38:32 It was the entrepreneurs who made America great, not progressive gov't.  The founders of the internet and tech companies, men like Tesla (electric power), Vanderbilt (trains), Rockefeller (oil), Carnegie (steel), J.P. Morgan (banking and finance), and the Snyders ( In&out Burger)
9735 2018-07-18 03:38:26 Look not only at the UCP but look at your own performance. It's lacking. Why else do we have disabled Albertans on Twitter and Facebook asking for help? The AISH stipend is barely sufficient and yet y'all have money for oil orphan well program. Nice. Where did y'all go wrong?

9748 2018-07-18 03:35:42 Putin’s has lot more to hide. He took so much from the Russian oil cartels that even CIA has lost track. Putin obviously begged Trump not to lower down oil & gas prices so much bc his main assets are in there. When a news outlet becomes political toys they are no longer credible
9749 2018-07-18 03:35:39 39k a nominal amount lol. I wish most Americans today were able to say the same. Maintaining dialogue with Republicans who deny climate change, are in bed with oil companies, pulling out of the Paris deal destroying any environmental protections etc. Cmon really? GL with that.
9750 2018-07-18 03:35:38 Venezuela was doing just fine until our sanction regime destroyed them after they wouldn’t privitize their oil for our oil companies
9751 2018-07-18 03:35:25 His lack of ass in the background makes me sad. But also he has his twic card...  why isn’t he out on the oil rigs...? So much more money to be made there, but they don’t take people with assault charges on their records.

9760 2018-07-18 03:34:45 I was thinking they're right across the street, there's no Infiniti dealer in town, and it's a friggin' oil change. How the hell do you forget to put the cap back on?

9764 2018-07-18 03:33:49 @camanpour Ms. Amanpour, I enjoyed your interview with David Graeber. I would like to clarify, though, that Alaska does not pay a "basic income" to its residents. They pay a small annual dividend ($1100 in 2017) that comes investments of oil and mineral profits.
9765 2018-07-18 03:33:47 If you really cared about immigration you'd be all over climate change. How much immigration is climate related? Oil company/nation states can't burn the world down then be surprised when people run away from the fire.
9766 2018-07-18 03:33:46 Less concern for inflation, as crude oil prices fall.
Hopefully sooner than later, eliminate all Tarrifs.
9767 2018-07-18 03:33:41 It’s not hard! Sauté with oil and garlic and ginger and soy sauce and it’s 
9768 2018-07-18 03:33:28 I made samosas and tried to eat one straight out of the oil... I now have a huge blister on my lip from the burn. My face is a monument to hubris.
9769 2018-07-18 03:33:20 Soooo I sprayed my patio with cedarwood oil today in hopes of having some alone time outside without the frequent visits from all of Tennessee’s creatures as guests...and, as we speak, I have some frog looking thing with wings staring at me right now. #CallForHelp 
9770 2018-07-18 03:33:06 If Russia owns Trump, who owns the rest of his party? I'm guessing dark money 1%ers and a couple oil barons?
9771 2018-07-18 03:33:04 I'm in the middle of a brief Twitter vacation, but I did want to say that I think your essay is insightful about some aspects of how social media gatekeepers work. At the same time, I think that the fear of big pharma & much of the snake oil you promote is harmful & disproven.
9772 2018-07-18 03:33:02 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying

David Graeber is a fool. You were hoodwinked re Alaska; citizens receive a stipend due to the OIL/Energy generated by the Industry/State alliance, Not because they live in cold weather. He's a fool / liar.  he know the real reason. 
His Book and entire concept- BS.

9787 2018-07-18 03:31:32 These oil folks thought they were going to intimidate the people of Arvin with scare tactics about all the money we’d lost and jobs lost, but little did they know we got facts. No sob stories here, the residents were prepared with facts and cited laws and regulations. I love it!!
9788 2018-07-18 03:31:25 Harper silenced all scientists in Canada in regards to groundwater and environmental effects... LOLLZ you were good until that presentation. Show me a conservative who talks about specifically “responsible oil drilling” as their platform
9789 2018-07-18 03:31:18 You ever just look at a pic of someone and wanna wipe the oil out the crevice of they nose
9790 2018-07-18 03:31:02 The only chip bag that has so much grease in it that you are legally required to dispose of it in one of those nonflammable steel barrels where mechanics throw away their oil soaked shop rags.

9801 2018-07-18 03:30:23 me to me: for the hundredth time drowning your body with coconut oil is not a shower replacement pls wash your hair for once
9802 2018-07-18 03:30:19 Inspecting where you send Nigeria’s oil to refine. The dumbest decision any government in the world has done.
9803 2018-07-18 03:30:17 Why not use olive oil more...I read that olive trees need little water, also jojoba? Coconut??? So many of these oil producers can be grown in areas that are tropical...where so many developing nations are

9808 2018-07-18 03:29:34 It all comes down to the oil-pipeline in Syria. Trump may have promised Putin control of the world's oil ... look at the oil connections among key Republicans who surround trump.  Trump is simply a pawn.
9809 2018-07-18 03:29:27 threw half a bottle of orange essential oil in my diffuser and let me tell you it was totally worth it my room is fruity  AF.

9811 2018-07-18 03:29:19 @realDonaldTrump I just heard Obama describe his philosophy. It encouraged entrepreneurship and universal income. Those ideas are oil and water to me. Could you please describe the utopia in which he lives?
9812 2018-07-18 03:28:37 Banks make big profits, Monsanto, Wal-Mart, airlines, coal, chemicals, ships, railways. Why is oil always the pariah? It creates jobs & supports families. Got gasoline?  is regulated far greater than USA. Take care of your own country please.

cooking a simple ham.
9818 2018-07-18 03:27:54 Plus I have to get an oil change 
9819 2018-07-18 03:27:52 I would add coconut oil, eggs and avocodo 
9820 2018-07-18 03:27:48 I rub my belly with Shea butter, coconut oil, and olive oil mixed
9821 2018-07-18 03:27:48 when everybody telling you to take castor oil 
9822 2018-07-18 03:27:36 You could do OIL ON as well if we’re trying to keep it sexy.
9823 2018-07-18 03:27:32 a great (and refreshingly) critical read. though there are some bizarre causalities stated such as " The Syrian refugee crisis...is largely responsible for...Brexit.".

#Brexit was its own snake oil crazy, & needed an excuse.

regardless, more balanced article than most.
9824 2018-07-18 03:27:31 You are really lucky you are running in a state where people actually believe your BS. Conservative approach to education, would actually kill public education you damn snake oil salesmen.
9825 2018-07-18 03:27:22 Not a review account but I just did a tree oil sheet mask and GUYS never in my life have I been so satisfied with a face mask 100/10 highly recommend that shit was rediculous it was so good
9826 2018-07-18 03:27:16 wowwwwwwww I’ll be greasing my shit with coca butter and baby oil!! Me and Lil one gone shine
9827 2018-07-18 03:27:10 Eeek! My scalp is itchy just reading that. We use this natural essential oil spray that is supposed to discourage the little bastards. Brand is Fairytails and it’s called “Rosemary Repel”
9828 2018-07-18 03:27:10 Coconut oil isn’t the best thing there is in the world all that shit you see on twitter to use coconut oil on your body isn’t true
9829 2018-07-18 03:27:04 We do. I am a little drained tonight after dealing with that accident and the oil change becoming a 'need to replace all brakes and the front roters' as well visit. I missed my crossfit class but still did 3 sets of sit ups and push ups while there! They likely thought me crazy!
9830 2018-07-18 03:27:04 True we like European union and voted to remain in way a SEAT not a half arsed whatever England having way nae seat less wealth plus they lose the oil gas water renewables financial passport rights. suppose putin and trump will make sure there ok
9831 2018-07-18 03:27:04 If olive oil is made of olives then what is baby oil made of ?
9832 2018-07-18 03:27:03 You know it was like that with Obama too? We've always bought large amounts of oil from Russia
9833 2018-07-18 03:26:46 Yeah, that's about what his minions are buying... and he's selling. He truly is a remarkable Carnival Barker... in the 20s he could have sold a ton of snake oil too!
9834 2018-07-18 03:26:21 You are calling snake oil on the wrong man.
9835 2018-07-18 03:26:20 Not as fun but..Unemployment down, black unemployment lowest ever,Hispanic unemployment almost lowest ever,Hispanic approval up 10%,stock market up ,North Korea giving up nukes ,ISIS destroyed,tax cut,NATO paying 38B,called Merkle out on 400B Russian oil deal,Gorsuch,Kavanough
9836 2018-07-18 03:26:18 Come to Saudi will give you oil
9837 2018-07-18 03:25:59 Indeed, and the oil / coal so useful today comes from this period and before. Magnetosphere was 3x stronger (MUCH LESS GCRs) in the Mesozoic 100 million years ago. No cryosphere and a flourishing biodiversity. But today brainwashed people think hot times are a threat.

9840 2018-07-18 03:25:38 Proud of my little city today. City council came through. But most important the people of not only Arvin, but Lamont, Delano, Shafter, Lost Hills, Bakersfield, McFarland and many others that came out to tonight’s meeting in support. Damn those oil people were pissed!!

9843 2018-07-18 03:24:45 Looks great! Good way to avoid succumbing to last minute Amazon Prime Day temptations. Definitely better than waiting for an oil change and tire rotation on my car to be finished this afternoon. 
9844 2018-07-18 03:24:36 Everyone keeps saying PUTIN has something on Trump. Yeah 500 BILLION $$ in North Sea Oil. The only way to a warm water port is through the Ukraine. Get rid of the sanctions for a 10% cut? 50 BILLION to a moron imbicile who won't admit he cheated his way into office. That's it.
9845 2018-07-18 03:24:30 Makes sense. A repeat of the Nazi offensive in summer 1942 with the objective of capturing the oil fields of the Caucuses. So, can we assume then that Donald Trump is the EU's "Stalingrad"?

And apparently I have to CHANGE MY CAR'S OIL? AND put gas in it? I don't care if it works 99% of the time, I'm gonna set that shit on fire over the 1% of the time it doesn't!
9850 2018-07-18 03:23:39 Brent to retest $80/ barrel by end-2018 – Goldman Sachs.

Persist..., 
I had earlier predicted oil prices would go trend up to $90/barrel.
9851 2018-07-18 03:23:26 HAHAHHAHA taas pa ni nga kaso
9852 2018-07-18 03:23:22 it's super easy! just equal parts shea butter and baking soda and like 5 drops of an essential oil of choice (i used lavendar) and then like 2 drops of tea tree oil! mix it together and voilà
9853 2018-07-18 03:23:04 and then I may add an oil on top of that, I use @SolanaLuxe garden fairy if it’s before I’m doing my makeup or @BahiCosmetics sunflower sweets serum if I’m going to bed!
9854 2018-07-18 03:22:18 saw the cutest pup while getting an oil change but it was a service animal aka no petting

9856 2018-07-18 03:22:01 Didn’t hear him say that to Putin! However, I do know that all sanctions are still in place, he took care of Russia in Syria when they crossed that red line, and if the NATO countries buy their oil and gas from us, we can wreck Russia’s economy in less than 6 months.
9857 2018-07-18 03:21:48 What the heck @TheRealTriscuit, I picked up a box of my favorite crackers (fire roasted tomato & oil) and got PLAIN TRISCUITS. You guys put the wrong crackers in the box and now I'm just eating cream cheese.

9870 2018-07-18 03:20:48 will someone take my car to get an oil change for me tomorrow so I don’t get attacked by all the mechanics telling me everything that’s wrong with my car

9880 2018-07-18 03:20:01 Also I think kids won't do the oil and gas route. Already kids in geology having no jobs. It's a desert for them. I doubt the activity will come back; Calgary has to diversify. I'm curious how UCP will turn this page. Big debt, C tax revenue needed for paying GOA bills= problem.
9881 2018-07-18 03:19:48 Right on, Ricardo. We all need Peace in the World ..not WW3 Nuclear Holocaust that both parties majority wants. First destroy their economy (NGC/LNG/Oil sales to EU) when there are at least half of EU buys them from other countries (OPEC, EU, US, Canada). We can sell our LNG toEU
9882 2018-07-18 03:19:39 It's all crap. Fox news is big oil and preserving the dollar. MSNBC is socialism and population control. CNN is straight up deep state propaganda. I look at numbers and direct quotes. And the ones I quoted were real.

9893 2018-07-18 03:18:44 Maybe they will  come  back. But this downturn seems different than all the others. It's prolonged and there isn't the money being invested in the oil industry. The tailings won't get remediated IMO. The bankrupt oil companies won't do their orphan well remediation. We're stuck.

9906 2018-07-18 03:17:06 Why doesnt trump talk about the big trade deficit with Russia, the US is about 15 billion in the hole with Russia, we buy lots of oil from Russia. Now I get why it was so important to get gas prices back up, to give to Russia.

9933 2018-07-18 03:13:10 In addition, Trump’s actions have been quite anti-Russian: specifically targeting Russian soldiers in Syria, doing everything to lower oil prices, calling for Germany to stop buying natural gas from Russia. All bad for Russia.

9936 2018-07-18 03:12:45 unsa nga position imong ganahan sa imong mga igsuon? HAHAHA
9937 2018-07-18 03:12:43 What’s the best oil for lubing up a muscular boy?
9938 2018-07-18 03:12:35 Yes, and suspending the STCA might be the way to go. But there is no use dividing opinion and using scaremonger tactics to exacerbate the situation. Which is what the CPC is doing. Come up with a viable solution rather than pouring oil on the fire.
9939 2018-07-18 03:12:32 That’s just an excuse to justify the low oil production due to the destruction of PDVSA
9940 2018-07-18 03:12:30 Argan oil is all fun and games till you obliviously use too much and drip like a soul glo ad
9941 2018-07-18 03:12:13 if i lived close to you i could just change your oil for you in like 15 mins welp 
9942 2018-07-18 03:12:07 There are plenty of people all over North America who are helpless to big oil and big gas... due to the economy. They can’t move, they don’t have the means, and a lot are right leaning conservatives. And they can’t drink their own water because of fracking and oil refuge.
9943 2018-07-18 03:11:56 I was SO excited for the Lush foundation to drop but it's literally just tinted coconut oil and I'm ready to dive head first into the void
9944 2018-07-18 03:11:41 But tonight, I'm prototypical poet, nursing bourbon, journaling, burning midnight oil 
9945 2018-07-18 03:11:37 I gave myself first degree burns on my wrist with cooking oil and they look like fish 
9946 2018-07-18 03:11:34 Easy!Why do some of these Countries buy oil from Russia.  Who we are is a Country that must put our Country first. Who they are, are Countries who put themselves first. If they need us, we will be there and you must know that or are you just a Trump Hater!
9947 2018-07-18 03:11:28 my mom bought me this moisturizing oil yesterday, i feel so beautiful
9948 2018-07-18 03:11:27 how come that a tvl strand student doesn't even know how to cook dishes and is definitely afraid of popping oil
9949 2018-07-18 03:11:19 What position you like with your siblings?...
9950 2018-07-18 03:11:16 If I just roll around this party with baby oil in hand will I be arrested?
9951 2018-07-18 03:11:14 โปสบพ.น่าจะได้เสาร์นี้ไม่ก็อาทิตย์หน้าเลย ถถถถ ได้โปรดมาตอนอยู่บ้านเถิด
9952 2018-07-18 03:11:10 It was irans money for oil we bought? :
Uranium ws to go to first breeder reactor for poor starving to feed and educate. :
Etc
9953 2018-07-18 03:11:02 Yes, I agree it's a bad plan on many levels but "expand oil production to fund climate action" is their plan.
9954 2018-07-18 03:10:52 HAHAHAHHA lisod kaayo
9955 2018-07-18 03:10:46 using tea tree oil to treat acne >>>
9956 2018-07-18 03:10:45 My daughter had an all over body Psoriasis for a few years. Docs tried steroid creams. Per my suggestion she took 1 TBS Nordic Natural cod liver oil and Great Lakes Collagen. It’s 95% gone. Might be worth a try.
9957 2018-07-18 03:10:23 โอ้โหหหห ฮืออออออออ พูดละเศร้าจังค่ะ
9958 2018-07-18 03:10:22 So...uh...microwaves and olive oil.  

Yeah.

I guess they don't play nice with each other.
9959 2018-07-18 03:10:18 Aku yang apply bio oil tiap tiap hari pun macam malas jaa inikan pulak gegadis yg follow skincare pakai mcm mcm product.
9960 2018-07-18 03:10:18 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
9961 2018-07-18 03:10:00 Is there a more noxious mix of horseshit and snake oil to be found anywhere than the "profession" of "body-language expert?"
9962 2018-07-18 03:09:58 nice try!
9963 2018-07-18 03:09:46 para maka hitch tayo kuys

9966 2018-07-18 03:09:15 If it tastes anything like olive oil cake, I’m in
9967 2018-07-18 03:09:08 剛力彩芽似も・・・
9968 2018-07-18 03:09:07 บ้านเราการ์ดไร้มารยาทจริงค่ะ จำจนถึงวันนี้โดนเอาตูดชนหน้า
9969 2018-07-18 03:09:00 @GermanyinUSA Why is it the German people believe the US should pay for their protection while Germany slays US in tariffs. And then goes suicidal and pays the wolf at the door with oil and gas purchases??
9970 2018-07-18 03:08:46 What position are you in your siblings? idk HAHAHHA

9973 2018-07-18 03:08:34 STOP ROBBING AND DESTROYING MOTHER EARTH TO SATISFY PATHETIC UNSATISFIABLE “NEEDS” FOR OIL AND OTHER CAPITALISTIC GOODS
9974 2018-07-18 03:07:52 Possibly the downturn was inevitable. Fracking boom in the USA. No pipeline expansion. The resistance to Kalamazoo type events impeding oil devel. @OilGasCanada Redwater decision makes us liable. The poor record of remediation tells us the future major liability. No more booms.
9975 2018-07-18 03:07:50 Just had coffee with him. Valero is hugeee. Fortune 50 independent oil refiner. Last year their revenue was over USD90b 

And I’ve never heard about them 
9976 2018-07-18 03:07:48 hey @jbbudgor they are basically a tiny convection oven, so it all comes down to the oil you put in them and the food you are trying to cook with them.  airfry an Avocado in avocado oil, @VinnieTortorich will approve it.
9977 2018-07-18 03:07:37 In fact he discussed adding more Russian sanctions, and he's trying to steal the Russian oil Business lol

9981 2018-07-18 03:07:15 Commodities Trading Results (A) - WTI oil:-

1. [18.07.18 - 18.07.18] - Long 67.50, TS 68.06, Gain 0.83% x20
9982 2018-07-18 03:07:02 Your oil and gas petitions that claim “local control” actually lessen the very limited control localities have over the oil and gas invasion force. Colorado registered voters, ONLY sign petitions for 97, the safer setback initiative.
9983 2018-07-18 03:06:54 By day I provide Lone Worker tech solutions to keep employees safe, and other cool tech, driver behavior app to reduce distracted driving.  When not working I'm glamping in Drumheller, walking a cute dog, oil painting or crocheting .. mixed bag of interests! Love @crackmacs
9984 2018-07-18 03:06:35 If we go behind our ally to do business with an enemy of our ally, we'll probably get sanctioned. E.g American plans to increase sanctions on China if it's buys Iranian oil.
9985 2018-07-18 03:06:35 Nothing to do with the Paris Accord...its a fraud like other trade deals. We're not using as much coal and oil for energy as more cleaner resources are being used more often, that's why its going down. 
Sadly, China dgaf...they allow people to breathe in that shit.
9986 2018-07-18 03:06:28 kailan alis ng mga taga NASA kasi sabay na tayo sa kanila

9988 2018-07-18 03:06:25 Avg lease = 3 yrs x 200=$7200. You can get a decent car for $7200. If you drive it 5 years you can save $4800 minus routine maintenance (tires, brakes, battery, oil, wipers) = $4000. Plus, it will have residual value, say $3-4K. Quite a turn around. But, a new car is nice too.
9989 2018-07-18 03:06:23 Vegetarians and Vegans: don’t forget to take Algae oil (which is high in DHA/EPA Omega 3 acids) and natural B vitamins (no synthetic shit). SUPPLEMENT
9990 2018-07-18 03:06:12 Current solar and wind technology was obsolete 30 years ago- fact.
There is abundance of free energy available but the oil industry is too murderous and greedy.
Fossil fuels r the TRUE answer to preserving our regional towns and cheap power atm, until disclosure
9991 2018-07-18 03:06:07 No Karen, we’re supposed to use petroleum jelly, not oil...
9992 2018-07-18 03:06:02 Walay translate2... Hihihi
9993 2018-07-18 03:05:45 You may need to do something like cornhusker’s lotion with a glove on overnight. Even just coconut oil with a glove on is really helpful. But dry patches of skin can also mean you’re not drinking enough water. Could be anything really. I’ll stop talking now.
9994 2018-07-18 03:05:40 I just need a plug so I can make some butter or oil...
9995 2018-07-18 03:05:32 Tara...

9997 2018-07-18 03:05:24 James 5 verse 14: Is any among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the lord.
9998 2018-07-18 03:05:23 Mr. Trump is right. MSM is real enemy of this country. These ppl want to trouble a true patriot President. @realDonaldTrump has many flaws and has done embarrassing things, but they were all done when he was ordinary American and NOT a politician. Mr. Trump loves his country.
9999 2018-07-18 03:05:17 Bill Nelson at 55% seems fair. Although he’s leaking oil it seems. He better hope those Pasco county Trump voters back him or he’s in trouble.

10006 2018-07-18 03:04:39 MLB #AllStarGame rarely if ever disappoints and this year has been no different. That said, highlight of the night has unquestionably been the Expos themed caps 
10007 2018-07-18 03:04:29 Mending pake baby oil aja nder, aku pake minyak zaitun lah malah breakout :(

10009 2018-07-18 03:04:14 Tomorrow is 31st wedding anniversary. We'll hit the gym, get my hair cut, have the oil changed in the car and weigh in. Ah! Romance! I did get a dozen roses and a new wedding band (lost the old one at the aforementioned gym.), so it's not all domestic glamour.
