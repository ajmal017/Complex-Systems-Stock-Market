Reality is all commodities have swings, but long term demand is key.

36 2018-08-07 21:32:25 Hey there, New Followers! I was mostly offline this weekend but just fair warning that I tweet old books and old commodities, especially stuff traded from India, Indonesia, and Africa to England. I'm your coconut history go-to, but also wander past coral, parrots, monkeys, etc.
37 2018-08-07 21:29:02 “The  Industrial Revolution was merely the beginning of a revolution as  extreme and radical as ever inflamed the mind of sectarians, but the  problems could be resolved given an unlimited amount of material  commodities.” --- Karl Polanyi
38 2018-08-07 21:25:51 It is shocking the way that living animals are treated as ‘commodities’ not flesh & blood, bone & sinew with a nervous system and a brain. It’s 2018 and we’re treating our fellow creatures worse than shit!
39 2018-08-07 21:19:12 We are entering a golden age of commodities, take the helm and educate a generation of investors the vast implications of the 'EV revolution' and battery storage sector.  

Of all the technology innovations of tomorrow, the key ingredient of each comes via mining. Mining builds.

45 2018-08-07 20:56:46 Trade agreements specified what % would be paid in goods (like oil and East German radios and Romanian nose rings :-) and how much in hard currency. But over time the terms shifted in favour of hard currency and 'harder' commodities like oil, so Cuba could resell oil

58 2018-08-07 19:19:53 These young gals have horrible stories to tell and they have no one to tell.  Fact is a woman's life is made cheap in this country.  Music videos show them as commodities that gyrate their bums in bikinis and that's all.  This translates to blessers
59 2018-08-07 19:12:00 In other words Melissa Harris-Perry, (one of my favorite tv personalities) you'd have to pay me to go to Princeton or any Ivy League school today--it is a Commodities Brokerage Company that peddles in Entitlement, the basis of all discrimination and bigotry and, White Supremacy
60 2018-08-07 19:09:50 Commodities may be physical goods such as oil or gold as in this case that are traded whereas futures are contracts to buy and sell things in the future usually at agreed prices but delivered and paid for later. There is a difference .
61 2018-08-07 19:06:41 Check the ACT mentioned by Jerome. There's an explicit mention of commodities (of which gold is included).

Futures can be based on commodities or other financial instruments so need to confuse yourself with the terminologies. It's just a contract to buy/sell @ predetermined px

68 2018-08-07 18:54:11 i am curios, you do understand that stopping climate change will require 1) the limitation of car ownership only to those who have to travel as part of their job, and 2) limiting jobs to only hose directly involved in production and sale of physical commodities, right?
69 2018-08-07 18:46:31 About that. Cost of commodities are a function of availability. A tuber of yam on Amazon costs 22 dollars. Does that mean naira is stronger.

113 2018-08-07 14:44:01 Bueno, un resumen detallado de las últimas tres semanas de los commodities por favor
114 2018-08-07 14:43:23 DIJE COMMODITIES NO TICKERS!!! >:(
115 2018-08-07 14:43:20 Happy birthday to commodities trader Ed Seykota (August 7,1946), author of “The Trading Tribe” (2005).
116 2018-08-07 14:42:51 Probably the reason for abducting the children of fleeing refugees & immigrants on the south border of USA. The girls taken for prostitution, the boys for slave labor, & the babies for Black Market adoptions. Just commodities.
117 2018-08-07 14:40:07 Otra cosa es sin súper ciclo de los commodities!!!
118 2018-08-07 14:32:45 Harvest Regional Food Bank will be in Waldo to distribute USDA commodities directly from the truck from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Wednesday August 8th.
The truck will be parked at the C.W. Easter Recreation Center located at 902 E. McKissack St.
119 2018-08-07 14:29:43 I hate every single one of those forex/commodities groups that gets commission for getting ppl to sign up for some BS package, subscription, or membership .

Can y'all even trade ?
120 2018-08-07 14:29:15 “2,800 of those aircraft were delivered across the world. 8,000 commodities, all under Gen. Levy’s leadership.” #AFSCCoC
121 2018-08-07 14:29:02 TRABAJO 16 HORAS DIARIAS. TENGAN PIEDAD DE MIIIII. TE PUEDO RECITAR EL MARKET PRICE DE LOS COMMODITIES MÁS IMPORTANTES DEL MUNDO.

PERDÓN NETA PERDÓN. 
122 2018-08-07 14:15:25 Wish I could read it. Im reviewing a policy paper that repeatedly assumes charter schools are in a market that is like any other commodities market.
123 2018-08-07 14:10:29 Moody's estima que el crecimiento de mediano plazo de #Chile será cerca de 3%, por debajo de la tasa anual de crecimiento de 3,7% prevista para 2018, y muy por debajo de las tasas de crecimiento reportadas con anterioridad al shock de commodities de 2014 #MDYChile2018
124 2018-08-07 14:08:59 En Colombia, dependemos de materias primas y nuestro crecimiento económico está condicionado a las mismas.

Debemos estar atentos a la guerra comercial que ya está empezando a afectar a algunos "commodities" y a quienes dependen de ellos.

Ejemplo el Cobre en Chile.
125 2018-08-07 14:06:22 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
126 2018-08-07 14:00:01 Commodities: Rice -2.35%, Platinum +1.64%
127 2018-08-07 13:59:46 I am fully aware of that and the history of how they got there. Nuts and bolts didn't start as commodities and even when they became so, it took time to stabilise with Whitworth standards.
128 2018-08-07 13:57:29 Doing very well in commodities - coal, LNG records
129 2018-08-07 13:36:08 Trading their own kids as “commodities”?  This is the lowest I’ve heard of in my life. 
I don’t know what kind of punishment can exist for this aberration but I’d see execution as too generous and easy.
130 2018-08-07 13:21:31 Economies are being hammered as commodities priced in $, global trade - letters of credit / banks priced in $.
Riddle me this, Airbus sells planes in USD, pays sub contractors in USD who then must convert into host currency. Now project this out globally.

Over 11 trillion $ debt
131 2018-08-07 13:10:30 Bottom line: non market economies do not invest in and avoid scarce or expensive technologies and commodities because there is no price incentive to pursue them. Non market medicine will always eschew costly treatment in favor of cheaper, easily distributed treatments.

133 2018-08-07 12:48:24 Will deal with the basics 
The higher the volatility the higher the returns. Commodities pegged with fixed income is no news. If you play your long and short positions in commodity and forex you could make more than what’s promised.
NB:
It’s possible it’s a scam or not
134 2018-08-07 12:47:02 1) Chavez/Maduro expanded the social safety net by redirecting profits from the state oil company.  There wasn't a dramatic rise in taxes on the rich and, in fact, this reliance on the commodities market rather than taxes is partially to blame for the crisis.
135 2018-08-07 12:46:05 Cual es el reto Venezolano? Devolver las instituciones y la Republica...para lograr monetizar esos commodities. Incentivar el retorno del recurso humano con estabilidad y garantias. Desarrollar el mercado interno .. expandir el mercado externo. Identificar competitive advantages
136 2018-08-07 12:39:08 #KalaignarHealth very shameful of #aavin milk shops. They were the first ones to close their shops n flee.

142 2018-08-07 12:16:40 When securities are being traded in a regulated market, there can be no ambiguity to fundamental issues that could affect market prices.  The players/competitors are commodities to be bought and sold based on supply and demand so total transparency on injuries, etc is imperative

151 2018-08-07 11:54:31 This big 2018 your country doesn’t have an established commodities trading regulatory body. Out of 10 commodities traded, this country can boast of 4 or more. It’s sad.
152 2018-08-07 11:45:05 Whoever breaks away, go ... this isn't about Corbyn...it's a grassroots movement understanding trickle down economics, elite struggling to maintain their privilege so others are commodities to be used to maintain them, must end.

154 2018-08-07 11:31:43 So bleak that while smaller commodities that serve as class markers have become more accessible, the trade off has been "never buy your own home and die in debt anyway"
155 2018-08-07 11:25:30 There is an immense power in being able to recognise one's traits as commodities and employ them to produce the desired results #girlpower
156 2018-08-07 11:18:41 The mantra about choice positions parents and their children as consumers and schools as commodities, when education is and should be seen as a common good. Please @tanya_plibersek see sense, understand true Labor values! @ALeighMP Let's get it right #Gonski #auspol
157 2018-08-07 11:10:37 Not a big deal to you #PDuterteLiarLiar because everything to you is a joke even the Presidency! Look at what's happening to our dear country! Drugs worth billions of pesos continue to enter the Philippines. Prices of basic commodities are rising! China takes over our EEZ waters!
158 2018-08-07 11:00:51 Drugs make you a slave to capitalism and an enemy of the community sober up, get rid of these filthy commodities.
159 2018-08-07 10:59:35 Well, once these athletes start to become commodities, they learn real f-ing fast how to become smart, or they get taken advantage of by everyone, agents, friends, media, owners, advertisers, etc.
160 2018-08-07 10:56:52 @AhmedabadPolice @vnehra, your recent drive against haphazard parking is welcome, please suggest how to deliver essential commodities and daily need stuffs to Shops, this has lead to increase in bribes collected in addition to the challans - paldi area - sad a situation
161 2018-08-07 10:54:06 Transferred from leveraged fixed income to commodities — will tweet news and critical market related stuff
162 2018-08-07 10:42:52 Globalisation treats workers as commodities.
Best way to protect workers is to protect them from being undercut. Overseas markets should look to grow organically. Not be exploited for their cheap labour. The planet is being murdered at altar of GDP growth at any cost.
163 2018-08-07 10:38:34 As real innovation & development fade smartphones are becoming commodities but this is not where the industry wants to be. 

Smartphones are tangled up with fashion & status - people will pay for the status of premium & the industry makes more profit too.

167 2018-08-07 10:21:50 Are football players commodities or employees to the club? By the way it looks to us, they are simply a commodity. So, don't compare a normal employee to a footballer.
168 2018-08-07 10:20:11 #Accessibility
Countries must ensure that #familyplanning commodities and services  are accessible to everyone. This means services and information must be physically accessible, as well as affordable. @HDIRwanda @ICFP2018
169 2018-08-07 10:12:05 So then what is the basis for arguing that humans are the only species of animal who should never be treated like property or farmed for commodities? Is it as arbitrary as them simply being part of the same group/tribe as us? Isn't that the logic underpinning most prejudice?
170 2018-08-07 10:11:46 With 'differing' standards in beef or crops or other commodities like that, what does the US export that the EU actually want / need? Genuine question.
171 2018-08-07 10:10:35 I don’t do conspiracy theories but this one is pretty good. Russia and China fast + furiously exiting their USD-denominated assets + buying up much physical Gold (plus other hard assets/commodities). Ya kinda have to base local currency on something if it’s not a trusted CB...
172 2018-08-07 10:06:42 What about plastic bags and diesel oil? Surely these commodities are subversive?

Of the 144 banks that trade OTC London, just 7 of them represent Chinese interests. So is a Chinese led suppression of the global price likely or even possible? In my view No.

221 2018-08-07 05:19:57 What you're observing is an across the board trend in all commodities (yes it's tighter in Gold but that doesn't prove anything).

232 2018-08-07 04:20:37 Websites like pornhub are primarily used as commodities; distractions to keep people from paying attention to social unrest. Not to mention that leftists have monopolies on media companies and other forms of info dump The real issue is this mass hysteria and paranoia about speech
233 2018-08-07 04:18:42 If the Govt is really serious in selling chana at MSP, then why not Govt freeze trade price on exchange to be not below MSP and there should be some dmat account for commodities, so we can have only genuine traders.
This will automatically solve the problem.....

235 2018-08-07 04:10:01 A questao nao é o haddad ai, qlqr outro fantoche teria feito um trabalho de destaque pq nesse periodo o Brasil cresceu! E nao foi so por causa do Lula tbm, teve crescimento pq o trabalho do Plano Real foi bem feito, ciclo de alta das commodities e crescimento forte dos emergentes
236 2018-08-07 04:04:32 But for me, it's the other way around: products made for sale (w/ restricted licensing & laws to make digital work into commodities not freely shared) often lack important/useful attributes. What to do when sellers shirk responsibility?
237 2018-08-07 03:46:43 Is it just me or hinahayaan lang ng gobyerno natin na tumaas lahat ng presyo ng mga bilihin para mas konti ang makaaccess sa basic commodities to solve overpopulation? Kind of what they do in the Purge? Lesser people to feed, lesser budget. More budget for their pockets.

242 2018-08-07 03:07:08 She didn't steal any votes. If you are under the impression Jill voters would have voted for someone who touted Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, CTPA, TPP, TIPP, TiSA, 96 crime bill, then I have a bridge to sell you
243 2018-08-07 02:58:45 Blockchains don't create incentives beyond monetary. Medicine isn't about money because people aren't commodities.
244 2018-08-07 02:52:26 Prices of commodities at sky-high touches, wait for "sahhe" din, no controlling mechanism as of now under Modiji

246 2018-08-07 02:44:44 ....it’s what happens when energy (I’ll take is mostly the run-up in oil) is taken out: The CRB index comprises a basket of 19 commodities, with 39% allocated to energy contracts, 41% to agriculture, 7% to precious metals and 13% to industrial metals
247 2018-08-07 02:32:58 I hope it takes them...well forever, to get a rail line in to haul commodities out.
248 2018-08-07 02:26:21 Fuck the space-murderer you can HAUL SOME COMMODITIES.
249 2018-08-07 02:18:05 Commodities index, CRB
250 2018-08-07 02:10:03 muy superficial opinion. Alfonsin heredo alzamientos militares ,inflacion , deficit fiscal , pais sin reservas, tasas internacionales por las nubes , precios de los commodities por el piso , no tenia mayoria en el congreso , le hicieron 13 paros y ni el divorcio le votaron.....

252 2018-08-07 01:58:33 I have to disagree. Athletes should definitely use their platform to promote good causes that they care about. They're people too, not commodities for our entertainment.
253 2018-08-07 01:22:34 I beg to differ about your figures: 170,000 billio-REALLY?
California's top-10 valued commodities for the 2016 crop year are:
Dairy Products, Milk — $6.07 billion.
Grapes — $5.58 billion.
Almonds — $5.16 billion.
Cattle and Calves — $2.53 billion.
Lettuce — $1.96 billion.
254 2018-08-07 00:55:25 Entre Dinero y @ELTIEMPO están en una campaña maquilla políticos impresionante. Colombia tuvo crecimientos pobres en PIB durante la era Santos, reformas tributarias Mal diseñadas y somos dependientes de commodities. Cual desarrollo? Las 4G no son realidad.

257 2018-08-07 00:43:26 I agree BUT when companies become so large &popular to the point where they become used like utilities or commodities, they need to be regulated to make sure they're not practicing illegal or unethical practices that abuse or hinder anyone's rights. Think of it as if
258 2018-08-07 00:42:28 The idea is to have your money work for you. You have to save money to invest it, rather spend it.

There are 7 investment vehicles you can invest in 
1. Real Estate.
2. Stocks 
3. Bonds.
4 . Funds.
5. Mortgages.
6. Currency Exchange. 
7. Commodities and precious metals.
259 2018-08-07 00:34:38 Commodities sure services not so much.The idle rich make their living off the surplus value produced by the workers. Call it redistribution or guillotine insurance either way "mob rule" as you like to call it, is and will take back that surplus value to insure basic needs are met
260 2018-08-07 00:33:51 The Brexiteers are ludicrous fantasists rolling back trading evolution into an imperial past where human beings were dispensable commodities in robber baron ecological monstrosities.

They are idiots.

Economies revolve around regulatory alignment within powerful economic blocks
261 2018-08-07 00:32:02 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.
262 2018-08-07 00:31:17 Me: I believe animals are not commodities and should not be slaughtered or abused in any way_
Nonvegans: OMG WTF STOP FORCING YOUR OPINION ON ME
263 2018-08-07 00:31:15 A8 Injustice is good but sometimes hard for ss to bring nuance. Commodities are surprisingly good for my 9th graders in world - tea and cotton. #sschat
264 2018-08-07 00:21:53 dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all commodities, but the other side, but it's certainly not my wish In lean unlovely English. The 2/5
265 2018-08-07 00:20:48 Ciro "coroné" Gomes falou que irá taxar impostos sobre commodities pq o agro tem muito poder político. PIADA.
266 2018-08-07 00:10:38 You speak my language Steve I like your style  I believe dignity & integrity are our most precious commodities & I am tired of hate filled rhetoric. I really hope @Flotus #BeBest picks this up & Katy can spread her message far and wide 
267 2018-08-07 00:05:03 3189: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
