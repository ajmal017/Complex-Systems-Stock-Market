2 2018-11-14 23:59:39 Mmmm... Could we see a repeat of December 2017 is what I'm thinking?

There's pro's and con's to what's happening right now, will be interesting to see how this plays out. Hang tight!

6 2018-11-14 23:59:30 Famous words by andreas antonopoulos come to mind here - "Not your keys not your Crypto". As if I would trust a bank to hold my private keys. Psssh
7 2018-11-14 23:59:27 Discovered that in six months ive spent over a grand at starbucks getting coffee... 

If I wouldve put that into crypto I’d have tens of dollars by now.

The creator of BTC try to survive in a Fork of a Forked coin of his own creation. Too much ofs and ifs to be true. Finally it will disappear from the spotlights.

Trying to kill his creation? A father that kills her son. A freak...

12 2018-11-14 23:58:56 I dont know why but when I started buying crypto paper money lost its value. Haha for me paper money is just paper printed.
13 2018-11-14 23:58:48 Tried so hard to buy the ETH dip and just kept getting stoped out and all I accomplished today was giving coinbase $50 in fees...

17 2018-11-14 23:58:36 It may go down further. But I buy the dips and hodl. That is the best strategy for the average crypto investor. This is a good dip.

56 2018-11-14 23:56:33 You're on the wrong chain.

BTC is no longer Bitcoin.
57 2018-11-14 23:56:23 Yeah, I shut my rigs down 1mth ago. Not profitable after electricity
58 2018-11-14 23:56:15 Cool, you are super square. I’m surprised you trade crypto.

66 2018-11-14 23:55:28 Since I stopped 'partying' and started meditating 'going out of my mind' has gotten a whole different meaning.
67 2018-11-14 23:55:25 Right? Man... it’s like today, everyone is a noob.
68 2018-11-14 23:55:25 @Zavakrayn
69 2018-11-14 23:55:23 I’m buying #maxcoin
70 2018-11-14 23:55:20 This is one of those coins that I don’t see retrace any significant amount with other market moves and is making announcements almost daily of different partnerships. I’ve made a respectable amount money with the things I’ve learned from you...let’s keep it goin, let it ride!
71 2018-11-14 23:55:14 I wasn't aware there was news.  Always funny when you go to the crypto subreddits and the suicide prevention hotline it pinned though
72 2018-11-14 23:55:13 ぁああぁああぁああMikiミキ三木ぃいいいぃいいいぁああぁああぁああギッギィィィイクッイクイクイクイクッイクハヤぁああぁああーーーー！！！！！
73 2018-11-14 23:54:58 It always was though.
74 2018-11-14 23:54:49 Think of this way too. Let’s say hypothetically BTC moons from here, capital will flee from alts into it generally. We dump from here.... capital flees from it ALL at this point.
75 2018-11-14 23:54:49 Those who do it for the $$ and not the tech and doesnt fully understand what crypto mean to the society gonna get rekt ofc
76 2018-11-14 23:54:39 f
77 2018-11-14 23:54:33 10k brah
78 2018-11-14 23:54:17 Seems like it’s xrp time... 
wouldn’t surprise me if everything @haydentiff has been saying all along about xrp/crypto is comes into fruition...
79 2018-11-14 23:54:11 How much they paying you for this shit?
80 2018-11-14 23:54:06 The language in crypto is ridonkulous! I can't understand what half the people are saying LOL
81 2018-11-14 23:54:05 @CoderCrypto  you working on a new header photo?
82 2018-11-14 23:53:58 ギッ…
83 2018-11-14 23:53:46 @ApolloCurrency look at tweet . Clearing missing crypto trending marketing. You guys are good but  without marketing nothing , community is full of airdrop people already cleaned by 45k , make single community and see how it grows. Bring it to real exchanges
84 2018-11-14 23:53:45 イクッ？あぁぁぁぁぁぃぃいぃいいイクイクッイクイクイクイクッイクハヤぁぁああぁぁああーーー！！！

87 2018-11-14 23:53:25 I'm buying both in anticipation of Bakkt...knowing this very well could go into next spring as a bear...

98 2018-11-14 23:52:37 So more and more industrial players are now in #crypto? All these new hedge funds, custody solutions, you name it it's been said.  So how come We had a 20k #Bitcoin before all these 'players' got involved? And why now they are dose the price keep going lower? 
Hmmmmmmm 
#BTC
99 2018-11-14 23:52:36 How about "Crypto is dead, teach me forex, Sensei" 
100 2018-11-14 23:52:33 損失がとまらない（Crypto）
101 2018-11-14 23:52:09 Exactly!
102 2018-11-14 23:52:05 Other option, nice bounce but big drop late December.
103 2018-11-14 23:52:01 I love how strong XRP is recovering compared to the rest of the crypto market. It just goes to show that the #XRPcommunity knows how to HODL strong because we truly believe in #XRP changing the world by creating the internet of value. #XRPTheStandard

105 2018-11-14 23:51:54 Again....I called this in your discord room and was ridiculed and kicked out. Haha. There doesn't have to be a reason. BTC is just dead right now. It will live again but not now.
106 2018-11-14 23:51:53 I’m a long term bull. I’ve been saying we will stick in this range for awhile.... which we have been. We just went under it (barely). I’m still a long term bull. It’s not worth the risk to me to reduce my crypto beta
107 2018-11-14 23:51:52 50 sahte rlinde kaldı 35 tllik çikolata gitti 15 tlde para üstü verdi 100tl göte girdi. Geçmiş olsun bakkala.
108 2018-11-14 23:51:45 I PM’d you
109 2018-11-14 23:51:41 I’ve been investing in crypto since 2012, and this has been one of the most interesting years..Yet boring for new investors. It’s never just about the price, but always the technology and the people backing and believing in it. I’m so excited for nxt few yrs!
110 2018-11-14 23:51:38 XRP強くないですか？

114 2018-11-14 23:51:19 I mean is it a good move to sell now? I think so on a majority of them
115 2018-11-14 23:51:17 He manages a few billions $ of crypto, so he can actually help his tweet to be accurate. Keep this in mind...
116 2018-11-14 23:51:14 またゲイの話をしている
117 2018-11-14 23:51:09 I also appreciate the design aesthetic. This is the kind of thing we need more of in crypto: a marriage of form, function, and usability.
118 2018-11-14 23:50:48 Smart ppl learn from other ppl mistakes.Ppl who make mistakes...well,shouldnt we support them,encourage them,be thankful to them...specially if they are new in crypto?If you can Kiyoshi,send them Safex again...just my opinion:)
119 2018-11-14 23:50:46 This will help with mass adoption and education . Btw DM , I’m putting on crypto and blockchain Meetup in Santa Monica . Love see if you can talk at this for a bit
120 2018-11-14 23:50:38 Been saying this for months crypto died along with the etherium scammers
121 2018-11-14 23:50:25 BTC潰すってマジかな

136 2018-11-14 23:49:21 Dear @fidentiaX - will you consider listing XRP as one of your base currencies in addition to fiat? It would create opportunities for crypto owners to join your platform and trade insurance policies. Thanks!
137 2018-11-14 23:49:07 Then u arent doing ur job lol
138 2018-11-14 23:49:07 Is anyone else excited to have something interesting to talk about today but still totally unfazed by the price action?
139 2018-11-14 23:49:03 I buy at the bottom like .01888
140 2018-11-14 23:49:01 Missed Dero too lmao.

Reeeek
141 2018-11-14 23:48:54 Bought more $BIS today
142 2018-11-14 23:48:52 Is there a web site where you can check the "one year ago today" price for most crypto coins?
143 2018-11-14 23:48:49 new financial technology time, great project
144 2018-11-14 23:48:47 Still haven’t seen one yet, amirite?
145 2018-11-14 23:48:39 Honestly given how hilariously elaborate the ceremony was, I felt pretty confident things were secure; if it turns out the key still got leaked somehow it might genuinely push me further in the paranoid-opsec-motherfucker direction.

 Waddup crypto twitter.
146 2018-11-14 23:48:35 今回のbtc下落の原因は？
147 2018-11-14 23:48:18 難しいですよね…
148 2018-11-14 23:48:15 Bro, this happened to me with Dero too.

I necc'd
149 2018-11-14 23:48:07 I think people in crypto make excuses of every thing. Can wait until the market dips in January (like it does every year) and hear the ridiculous reasons why
150 2018-11-14 23:47:50 Let's go with the 1st puzzle :) 5000ILCs come on...
151 2018-11-14 23:47:47 Also missed his Dero call.

165 2018-11-14 23:46:51 Yo Craig why do we have to wait a year to hear the explanation? Is this a suspense move? It's working. If Crypto doesn't work out, consider a job in Thriller Movies.
166 2018-11-14 23:46:43 Nothing is more annoying than someone who gloats when they're right and hides when they're wrong. You were calling for 4.5k last time BTC pumped to 7k. Stop acting like you have some sort of unique insight. You dont.
167 2018-11-14 23:46:42 ずっと思ってたんだけど電気代理論って過去に掘られたビットコインが今よりずっと安い電気代で掘られてたってことが計算から抜けてるよね。

それらは成り行きで売り浴びせても余裕でプラスなんだよね。

しかもハッカーに盗まれたりICO詐欺師の手に渡った分は実質電気代0円コインと化す。欠陥理論だよ

177 2018-11-14 23:46:02 @HandsomeJesus do you have Duff on suicide watch after the crypto news today
178 2018-11-14 23:45:59 Ok
179 2018-11-14 23:45:58 あれ？BTCもしかして今年最安値？
180 2018-11-14 23:45:58 音も全部鮮明に覚えてます。
181 2018-11-14 23:45:48 Oh true. I'll still eat the fries.
182 2018-11-14 23:45:48 Crypto?! Whoever is providing internet, can manipulate the crypto market. Crypto is nothing.
183 2018-11-14 23:45:47 Ok
184 2018-11-14 23:45:45 This line written by yourself:

"Everyone looks at the board differently. I don’t believe anyone can chart $BTC. I do believe that at any moment, it can go nuts in either directions and that’s why people love #crypto."

makes all your other statements worthless.
185 2018-11-14 23:45:42 Anyone holding crypto should be laughed at. This whole year has been a slow bleed of value. Many opportunities to get out and anyone who's stayed in deserve to lose all their wealth
186 2018-11-14 23:45:31 Thanks bro
187 2018-11-14 23:45:25 I agree however that 99.5% of crypto is worthless. No need for 99.5% of it, but tremendous need for gold 2.0.

192 2018-11-14 23:44:55 i am of the opinion that we have turned the corner and that crypto's are slowly getting acceptance as a form of derivative. With that of course comes all of the regulations but i can live with that

197 2018-11-14 23:44:45 Nel darkweb non si usano i bitcoin, sono rintracciabili, la blockchain del bitcoin è leggibile, indelebile e inviolabile. Per rendere le transazioni anonime si usano altri tipi di crypto, non è da poco la notizia che una donna ha pagato un killer in bitcoin e l'hanno presa.

213 2018-11-14 23:43:22 I thought it was supposed to replace money? Now it's become a hedge? Not to mention highly speculative, with the block chain run by who? Nerds, geeks, and crooks.  Crypto currency is nonsense.
214 2018-11-14 23:43:09 u will never see 4800 usd
215 2018-11-14 23:43:05 Judging by how bad the stock market has been doing since last month most of the smart Wall Street investors have already pulled out their money. The next bull run will reflect the OTC crypto buys they have been doing the entire year.

223 2018-11-14 23:42:13 NCASH - this being crypto I can see it moving 40-50% again, outside of that the market has spoken here and doesn't really show anything of value but very focused trading opportunities

245 2018-11-14 23:39:54 Lol. Not sure exactly what this means, but his content is always totally different from any other on any of the "sides" in crypto. It's just weird and interesting and sometimes challenging and very wry and layered.
246 2018-11-14 23:39:40 I beg to differ
247 2018-11-14 23:39:32 It’s hard to bruise those things.  I’ve tried for years.
248 2018-11-14 23:39:29 It will survive. The problem is people are trying to be rich just buy owning crypto. It can’t happen. I want to put my dollar in and I want to put my dollar out crypticly. I dont want to put a dollar in and take 50 cents out.

257 2018-11-14 23:38:37 35 TL lik çikolata ve paraüstü olarak  verdiği 15 tl. Toplam 50 TL. Bozdurduğu komşu hesaba katılmaz çünkü 50 tl aldı, 50 TL verdi. Ha, bu arada elinde kalan sahte 50 liği başka birisine çakmazsa tabi :)
258 2018-11-14 23:38:18 Has crypto fear set in? I wouldn't worry about fake satoshi dumping the largest Bitcoin addresses in the world only hold 100,000 BTC an most of them are exchanges none of them are his, sure he may have 50 to 100k BTC as an early miner but sure as shiz doesn't have 1 million #BTC

264 2018-11-14 23:38:05 Maybe if Ethereum could at least handle crypto kitties without coming to a halt there would be a 1% chance of sticking around. Mass adoption is literally only possible with more centralized chains for the foreseeable future.
265 2018-11-14 23:37:46 This is the path to the development and mass growth of crypto-currencies

267 2018-11-14 23:37:01 Taxes are taxes, whether it is fiat or crypto. Fees will come down as there become other options for crypto. An internet connection? It’s almost 2019 and very few places don’t have one. The list isn’t very long lol
268 2018-11-14 23:36:52 Crypto was not to be used in this manner, although it can be. There will always be bad actors in any financial environment, Time ALWAYS eliminates them. Cryptocurrency remains flawless. It is only bad when mixed with Fiat/Shit. Mix Gold with Shit and it will smell like Shit.

311 2018-11-14 23:32:54 Better is a bad word. To me at least it’s a step to more data integration and that’s positive. Not perfect, positive
312 2018-11-14 23:32:53 crypto関連のリスト見ると騒いでるけどその他じゃあんまりだからまだまだなのでは
313 2018-11-14 23:32:45 Thanks giving you say
314 2018-11-14 23:32:44 Hey Crypto Friends! Remember when we’ve heard in the past Buy when people are Fearful and sell when people are greedy? This IS the Fearful Time so you SHOULD BE BUYING!  Just my advice but jump in on this Fire Sale! $btc $neo $eth $xrp $icx $xlm $zrx $gas $dash $doge $wan $ada
315 2018-11-14 23:32:37 $NPXS all the way. They have a working product ready for mass adoption. Not most of the tokens on the top 10 with almost nothing but thin air.
316 2018-11-14 23:32:37 If crypto dies,

I'll at least have time to learn minecraft... And that other game called Fortnite

322 2018-11-14 23:31:59 Bitcoin 1000$ I hope but dont think it gonna go ! #btc #bitcoin #crypto just buy your own dip. Dont Buy high and Sell Low lol
323 2018-11-14 23:31:58 They are not wrong-diversification is a great thing. I slow load and own different crypto assets on MAJOR breaks but you wont ever see me screaming about how bullish something is without a technical confirmation or trend confirmation lol nor will I dump my account in shitcoins.
324 2018-11-14 23:31:57 SLT ON THE MOVE
325 2018-11-14 23:31:53 Sure - crypto data isn’t something WE (as in everyone involved) is getting right. I would ask, do you think a product like this is better than purely price-based crypto asset tools?
326 2018-11-14 23:31:27 So exactly the same as now but with crypto in the name. Still able to block and censor transactions as you control the supply. 
Exactly what Bitcoin and other decentralised currencies are aiming to circumvent.
327 2018-11-14 23:31:19 He's back crypto fam...
328 2018-11-14 23:31:11 This kind of behaviour is unacceptable only shows how manipulated and centralized is crypto space - where cpl of people pulling the strings.
329 2018-11-14 23:31:02 When can I pass this affliction on to another?
330 2018-11-14 23:30:57 CNBC Fast Money doesn’t recommend XRP fast money? I’ll let the Irony wash over you in an awesome wave  Why doesn’t @CNBCFastMoney just launch its own crypto called corruptasfuckcoin that way CNBC can look even more shameless when it’s promoted.

337 2018-11-14 23:30:20 Attention pro traders:

My good friend Jon Smith has lost everything in the #CampFire in Paradise, CA. His tools, cars, and all his personal belongings burned in his house leaving him with nothing.

Join me donate a trade to help Jon get back on his feet.

341 2018-11-14 23:30:03 but but the crypto blogs,
342 2018-11-14 23:29:55 İşte neden zarardayım görüyorsunuz 50 diyorum şuan :))
343 2018-11-14 23:29:51 Remember when Coinbase triggered this entire crypto slump by supporting fucking BCH
344 2018-11-14 23:29:31 Fml phon 
345 2018-11-14 23:29:14 So is a centralized database... which has the benefit of being easy to administer, easy to serialize (ignoring MongoDB), and just as easy to trust as a decentralized database when both are administered by the same IT staff. Outside of crypto$ it's a solution looking for a problem
346 2018-11-14 23:29:08 But where do you see the price at 5460? it's 5600 on Bitmex and was not but 3 score below that but 3 minutes ago.
347 2018-11-14 23:29:07 Not much upside after that massacre. Waiting for a retrace, but will gladly re enter there.
348 2018-11-14 23:29:06 Yeah lets get back to mentioning XHV in every single tweet.
349 2018-11-14 23:29:06 We will all be dead by 2067
350 2018-11-14 23:29:04 Things to remember: 

- Bakkt
- Fidelity
- Wall Street
- SEC 
- Bank of America
- Yale

- IMF
- Goldman Sachs

-Venture Capitalists 

Plus many more going all in on Crypto. And you think this crash is bad?  Well guess what, it's very inviting 
#bitcoin #crypto
351 2018-11-14 23:29:02 I've been in crypto for almost two years now and still have no idea what in the world the Bitcoin Core developers are working on or what the roadmap looks like. 

I'm sure the information is out there but I'm surprised it isn't made a little more public.
352 2018-11-14 23:28:50 Lol
353 2018-11-14 23:28:44 It’s not a lie

356 2018-11-14 23:28:36 THIS DAY LAST YEAR. BTC dropped over 2,000$ and then BOOM. #cryptoking

358 2018-11-14 23:28:25 Wonderful project I'm glad that I joined you! will succeed and achieve what was planned. Opening new doors, great business I am happy to have the opportunity to be part of this project!
359 2018-11-14 23:28:24 Heard of $dig? 3 billion tokens, each backed by 1$ worth of gold, and the market cap is 30 million. Ronnie Moas shills it and gives money to charity so this cannot be a scam
360 2018-11-14 23:28:17 Get rich quick? Nope, get crypto slowly as the market goes up and down. Minimizing your risk while diversifying you're holding across multiple platforms. #BTC #dogecoin #LTC #Dash #cryptocurrency
361 2018-11-14 23:28:10 最初の絵なんなのwww
362 2018-11-14 23:28:05 Damage was already done. Free riding in crypto lately so the down swings let me get into some good entries with new fiat.
363 2018-11-14 23:28:01 But everyone was sick of $btc going sideways.... 
364 2018-11-14 23:27:58 ホームステイしてたからね！
365 2018-11-14 23:27:58 とりあえず年末年始である程度上がって欲しい
366 2018-11-14 23:27:51 Believe that adult man has previously suggested he has 90% of his net worth in crypto. Also claims to be a ‘fund manager.’ Hard to tell where the lies stop and the incineration of cash begins.

370 2018-11-14 23:27:18 There are many crisis’s around the world..

375 2018-11-14 23:26:44 Crypto-Tulips are going to zero, listen to great investors like Ray Dalio
376 2018-11-14 23:26:44 本気で欲しいですわし‼︎‼︎‼︎
377 2018-11-14 23:26:39 High vol after relatively low vol will always get people talking, since single digit Bitcoin this is the case,  how do you not grasp that?
378 2018-11-14 23:26:32 Damn what kinda wing man are you
379 2018-11-14 23:26:29 peopl should buy lots of bch by now to gain big after the fork... it isn't
380 2018-11-14 23:26:08 i haven't heard of a such thing? Where they have talked about their own crypto
381 2018-11-14 23:26:07 Cevap 50 tl arkadaşlar. Bu hali yeni türemiş. Normalde bu soru 100 tl üzerindendi. İnanmayan aksini iddia eden gerçek paralarla yapsın, denesin. Sahte paranın gidip gelmesi kafa karıştırıyor.
382 2018-11-14 23:25:55 Gotta get back on that $LINK train man. Trust me brother
383 2018-11-14 23:25:49 Surely
384 2018-11-14 23:25:49 SFP on November lows working out well!
385 2018-11-14 23:25:44 you just can't compare crypto with dotcom
completely different
dotcom used internet as a magic wand for selling vaporware
crypto use internet to generate welfare and real engagement
think about it dotcom owned the entire internet
now internet is the fuel of tokens owned by people
386 2018-11-14 23:25:30 My boy!
387 2018-11-14 23:25:18 What technicals of price action are different in #crypto compared to other commodities? I do quite fine with technicals, sure you can't factor in fundamental changes to the market but generally it the charts show the way.  That is why risk management is so important.
388 2018-11-14 23:25:14 I see this as a massive buying opportunity for loading up on March futures.

Can't predict the future, but 4x back to ATHs? Count me in.

*Price of BTC at time of writing $5,460
389 2018-11-14 23:25:11 Contracts expired today.  Banks manipulate the exchanges, but crypto is still very healthy.  Criminal banks are trying to shake out the small guy. Hodl.
390 2018-11-14 23:25:09 Haha looser :) absolute bottom hey? @ToneVays look at this guy :)
391 2018-11-14 23:25:01 The fight between Jihan Wu and Csw has infected the crypto market apparently especially Csw threatens if people switch to mine Bch , he is gonna dump bitcoin.... Bitcoin 1000 doesn’t phase him ...lol
392 2018-11-14 23:24:54 BCH #Hashwar could help read the relationships and boundaries of the multiple de-facto powers that influence a bitcoin implementation and crypto ecosystem, Devs, PRs, Miners, Exchanges, Hardware MFG, Markets and Users. Hope someone is tracking that. @derose @vinarmani

410 2018-11-14 23:23:09 Idc how good you are at trading everyone that holds and accumulates throughout long periods of time will always be successful! Clearly your investment has to be into something solid, but if you aren’t accumulating in times of panic you will fail! Dont @ me #OnlyTheStrongSurvive
411 2018-11-14 23:23:09 Nice projek
412 2018-11-14 23:23:05 Lol yup
413 2018-11-14 23:22:52 People always want a reason other than the fact that nobody is interested in crypto now other than us people who spend all day every day watching it. I've said that for months.
414 2018-11-14 23:22:35 Any visually tangible innovation (drones, VR) will be overrated compared with non visual (eg crypto)
415 2018-11-14 23:22:33 It's pretty efficient to move money around quickly. Just convert crypto payment to cash right away to bypass volatility issue. Skip PayPal.
416 2018-11-14 23:22:31 Yes, bitpay wants far too much KYC from retailers and limits your tx processing accordingly. Major pita. As a consumer I love it though. Didn't know pundix had p.o.s. capabilities?
417 2018-11-14 23:22:20 You’ll be regretting that $AURA removal in due time.
418 2018-11-14 23:22:19 Lmao girl bye
419 2018-11-14 23:22:09 It might, after the fork.
420 2018-11-14 23:22:07 Y'all are my favorite gurus :)
421 2018-11-14 23:21:56 Hes cuteeeee slide the digits
422 2018-11-14 23:21:55 The market is weak. The only thing coordinated has been the moves up to take out shorts. Shorts are low now. Room for downside.
423 2018-11-14 23:21:46 Bruh...1% of his portfolio is more than most all of these fools on CT.
424 2018-11-14 23:21:36 wave 3 coming
425 2018-11-14 23:21:27 Not a big $xrp holder, but I think it’s smashing $BTC , same utility just faster and less manipulated. #crypto

430 2018-11-14 23:21:01 Crypto made a tragic  decrease because it went public so then these niggas decided jus to pump and dump
431 2018-11-14 23:20:59 Puh! Me done with my pet project? Get real man, I have no pet project in crypto, you do. 
If it is your actual title, speak like you earned it (like you say), sour loser!
432 2018-11-14 23:20:57 Whales simply executed everyone's STOPS.  It is part of accumulation.
433 2018-11-14 23:20:55 I was at alts. went to visit dad playing poker while all this happens

437 2018-11-14 23:20:23 CBOE futures expire with headlines : Btc and crypto are doomed for a dump. 

BAKKT launches on December 12th. 

The way they play the game is in plain sight.

These price fluctuations don't delegitimize blockchain in the slightest.  Adoption has always been a long-term play.

439 2018-11-14 23:19:33 The problem with Bitcoin is Humans. Especially toxic self centred ones like CSW. With this behaviour I am doubting the future of crypto. Mainstream will never take us seriously. It's like a playground of spoilt kids.
440 2018-11-14 23:19:31 Lol
441 2018-11-14 23:19:29 @crypto_jh Thanks for like my crypto brother:)
442 2018-11-14 23:19:27 #Blockchain #Crypto Big news:

South Korea's Financial Services Commission commissioner Choi Jong-goo said there is no issue with Korea's banks working with crypto exchanges to issue virtual accounts.

In short: Korea's crypto exchanges will no longer face banking issues
443 2018-11-14 23:19:25 All the "#Bitcoin will reach $30000+ by year's end" people really need to just count their losses and move on. #BTC #BitcoinTalk #Crypto

446 2018-11-14 23:19:19 Your positive sentiment is good for the long haul.  This crypto market is hard to predict.
447 2018-11-14 23:19:19 アルトの10%ダウンとか当たり前だけどBTCの10%って結構久々だよね。知らんけど。
448 2018-11-14 23:19:18 What have they said about #Carillion?
449 2018-11-14 23:19:05 For those watching the excitement in crypto markets right now.

Here comes the reverse pump. Hopefully you all have your positions and longs ready.

We could be in for a wild swing
450 2018-11-14 23:19:00 Nothing ever happens in Crypto! Boring.
451 2018-11-14 23:18:55 Jesus Christ! What sort of bullshit can I expect from a $250 phonecall? You're like a poor man's Suppoman or Ian Ballina
452 2018-11-14 23:18:52 That’s why everyone needs to start using crypto to buy porn. This is a no brainer. Free yourself!
453 2018-11-14 23:18:51 I got into this space because the mining aspect using cryptography fascinated me as well as the opportunity to create with it. I love what #cryptocurrency has taught me, challenged me, and allowed me to discover a passion that excites me every day. These are still the early days!
454 2018-11-14 23:18:48 One thing I love about the crypto community is how it draws in people from so many different professional backgrounds, personal backgrounds, and walks of life, and welcomes all contributions - can't say that about many industries (some positivity amid this slump )
455 2018-11-14 23:18:39 私の7万円返してくれませんか？
456 2018-11-14 23:18:33 Çikolata satılıp karşılığında 35 tl alındı o para cepte giden sadece 50 tl komşuya sahte paradan ötürü ödenecek para.
457 2018-11-14 23:18:29 What about binance makes it the best crypto exchange in your opinion? Are you interested in being an early user, helping to shape the trading interface of a new decentralized exchange: @merkleXOfficial ? #decentralized #merkleX
458 2018-11-14 23:18:27 wow. This defeats the so called "decentralisation" of crypto when three individuals have all this power to move the markets to these magnitude. This is scary and would have been criminal in traditional markets.
459 2018-11-14 23:18:18 Roger , Jihan , Craig and other big whales are in war for BCH hash rate. Basically they triggered this because they need to fight for their shit right now even if that means selling tons of BTC and switching miners to their forked coin
460 2018-11-14 23:18:12 I'm down to that! :)
461 2018-11-14 23:18:07 If you need a Gov to enforce your crypto dominance then your crypto is already worthless.
462 2018-11-14 23:17:56 How do you buy?

470 2018-11-14 23:17:29 If you are logical and can figure out mathematical equations you can make alot of money in the #crypto market regardless of your experience with technical analysis or studying a projects fundamentals
471 2018-11-14 23:17:27 I don't think it's about being bullish or bearish, it's about volatility and how much money is in even a 500$ dump. Long-term almost all crypto involved are bullish, but buying in at a lower price means a lot of profit in a couple of years.

476 2018-11-14 23:17:07 It kills me how dramatically bitcoin cash has effected XRP 20% Especially after seeing XRP rise while bitcoin fell last week. Feels like this shit will never end or until XRP takes the lead. It never made sense to me why crypto’s (XRP) are coupled when they have diff uses.
477 2018-11-14 23:17:05 The #crypto crowd doesn’t know how to cope or come to grips with the STO crowd, it’s really fun to watch
478 2018-11-14 23:16:53 how do you see cryptos in a short term? still buying alts?

LESSON: You are either IN crypto or you are OUT of crypto.
521 2018-11-14 23:13:07 Yes I was following the trendline of bouncing higher-lows @ 6.2ish -> 6.5ish.  Easy trade range even though everyone was complaining about it.  

Something to do with the BCH fork IMHO but I doubt we'll get back over 6 now that we broke down so hard .. 
522 2018-11-14 23:13:04 Lol, all they'll do is create a demand for alternate banking options. Crypto's already a thing, I don't see it going well for them to keep deplatforming like this.
523 2018-11-14 23:12:55 here we go...sensing a rebound effort. if you’re buying crypto now, i suggest selling any short term rally.

539 2018-11-14 23:11:44 I understand, let's see how $3K reacts first, of importance is time. Still people are talking about 'the next bullrun' but cycles last longer each time, so be prepared for a 3yr bearmarket with the option of seeing $1K BTC. Zoom out and be patient

611 2018-11-14 23:06:37 Maybe because in the grand scheme of things losing 10% from a $112B marketcap is a little different than losing $1B from a $10B marketcap
612 2018-11-14 23:06:23 I mean the alternate volumes

615 2018-11-14 23:06:16 The smashing pumpkins do the best version of landslide...

Don't @ me
616 2018-11-14 23:06:15 Hes right. Fiat ppr money holds its value because it's backed by the government that issued it. Crypto without sovereign backing remains a ponzi scheme hyped by millennials in pursuit of their crackpot dream to become rich in a day. You can't buy shit with coin. Instead buy gold.
617 2018-11-14 23:06:03 Thanks God you didnt say 2019 bear market
618 2018-11-14 23:05:48 That's my actual title. I earned it the hard way. It doesn't get quotes. 

Let's talk in a few weeks when emotions aren't running as high. I'll still be working on conquering the world with crypto, and you guys will be done with your pet project involving infighting. I'll be nice

621 2018-11-14 23:05:28 There's a $XHV whale placing and removing a 9 $BTC sell wall on #Bittrex. Makes me even more comfortable about this bag. Will keep buying down to 37k sats. Wish some of my crypto twitter friends would have DM'd me about this gem last month.... @crypto_Tyrion

630 2018-11-14 23:04:57 it looks like many TA got it wrong for Crypto for the short duration. Not a slow bleed now to the 4k range.
631 2018-11-14 23:04:50 Good morning crypto.
Wonderful plunge. Dig deeper for the prosper.
632 2018-11-14 23:04:46 Step 1: scan #Crypto Twitter for sentiment and see what scenario majority believes is most likely.
Step 2: counter trade.
Step 3: profit.
633 2018-11-14 23:04:43 Best, solid deal in crypto!!!!!
634 2018-11-14 23:04:39 You havent enough money?
You are on the way to destroy others with your war but for you it doesnt matter or not?
Think about the small piece Bitcoin holders, think about the small investors or that the whole crypto community wants a serious thing (acceptance of the masses)
635 2018-11-14 23:04:22 This dip has shaken everyone up. 2 prominent crypto twitter influencers had long on bitmex. Both liquidated. Trust your gut folks. I should have shorted. $eth $btc $trx $xlm $ada #crypto #cryptocurrency #blockchain #bitcoin #ethereum #altcoins #altcoin #hodl #hodlgang

665 2018-11-14 23:01:43 Captain is up to date on crypto , no need to advise
666 2018-11-14 23:01:38 Stated reasons are:

1. Environmental consequences of mining BTC.
2. The gambling and lambo mentality has taken over from the vague world changing promises of early crypto.

They've give the date of January 9th as the fall.
667 2018-11-14 23:01:38 ん？(・∀・)
668 2018-11-14 23:01:34 Great
669 2018-11-14 23:01:33 Multi-coin world now, and this is not just a miner, but a general purpose crypto device that just happens to include a gpu miner.  Also a super simple and beautiful mobile experience
670 2018-11-14 23:01:30 perhaps banks and institutions are escaping the big bubble economi, and running to crypto, thats what i believe. The are bying into a new system so they can leave all dept behind?
671 2018-11-14 23:01:28 Nice
672 2018-11-14 23:01:27 Did the rich Wall-Street boys received their bonuses yet?

696 2018-11-14 22:59:01 I’m sure the trader of $BTC $gxbt_f futures today who went short 5K contracts just minutes before massive block sales were launched on all major exchanges was pure coincidence.  Wake up people the big players can easily manipulate this stuff.  #bitcoin #crypto #xrp
697 2018-11-14 22:58:59 How to save crypto

1) Everyone make 10 sock puppet accounts
2) Tweet about how you're rage quitting crypto
3) ????
4) BTC to $50k
698 2018-11-14 22:58:58 For real though it's all good. I like to think I'm fairly honest when it comes to crypto. Obviously I'm not without bias though.

710 2018-11-14 22:57:25 My point also
711 2018-11-14 22:57:24 It was obvious that the end was nigh when CNBC added crypto prices to its front webpage and took out FX or bond yields or something like that. They no longer have the crypto prices there, naturally.

715 2018-11-14 22:57:04 Good news. I follow.
716 2018-11-14 22:56:54 States should not regulate crypto to clarify crypto legal status.  We explain why in our piece Against "Smart Contracts" -- worth a read to anyone in this space.

737 2018-11-14 22:54:20 Why?

755 2018-11-14 22:51:36 did you short?
756 2018-11-14 22:51:12 You honestly think all crypto projects will go to zero?? Not even 1 will survive?
757 2018-11-14 22:51:11 also, in go, you usually want to accept interfaces and return types. This is where Go shines IMO.

However, accepting interfaces for crypto operations is insecure, so there is a bit of awkward dance here.

Reading up on the Go way of thinking is interesting. @roasbeef

764 2018-11-14 22:50:28 Müşterinin yaptığı kar (attığı kazık) kadardır zararı. çikolata + 15 TL. Yani 50 TL zarar etmiştir.
765 2018-11-14 22:50:23 Mine was originally built to do something that’s not crypto mining that requires shitloads of parallel processing 
Then when I finished doing whatever that was that I daren’t do with cloud processing, ironically I jumped across to crypto as the cloud banned me. Spoilsports

768 2018-11-14 22:50:09 Read about imusify project. Nice idea that you already put into action. I like the facts about backing up NEO that needs to get worldwide attention as does imusify.

771 2018-11-14 22:49:49 HF前に利確して正解でした

やはり、仕上げに取り掛かってますねー

今まで色々と規制がありましたが、今回は毛色が違いますね。

マイナーが居ないこの世界は、無価値ですよ

今回は正直なところ、、底が分かりませんね

788 2018-11-14 22:48:08 XRP seems to perform well considering the crypto market status today. XRP shorts charts are def interesting at this time. XRPBTC chart (daily) has that disastrous candle pretty much erased (only wick left). All of this with rising vol and few indicators getting rdy for a pump

809 2018-11-14 22:46:41 BREXIT is scheduled for Spring, 2019. Because of this there is talk of transferring wealth into crypto. Then, there is the U.S. economy...The longest America's stock market has functioned in a "boom" cycle (atleast since circa 1846) is ten (10) years. that is up in Spring, 2019.
810 2018-11-14 22:46:40 Invest in #XLM , there’s a reason it has held up in the bearish market, research what their doing, what companies they are involved with. In order for mainstream adoption which is coming, the shit coins will evaporate. This needs to happen for most crypto to be legitimate.

822 2018-11-14 22:45:34 I've been taking a break from #crypto #twitter as the market has been nonexistent, #volatility wise.

Seems though that there's been a bunch of drama unfolding in my absence.

I keep seeing some bald dude name Tony Vag popping up on my feed.

824 2018-11-14 22:45:16 What you fail to see is that crypto does have an underlying asset, the ability to create enforceable smart contracts.

Still love you work and I do invest with Europac, but I think you’re wrong about crypto (not necessarily btc though).

831 2018-11-14 22:44:50 I agree @fomosaurus  Everyone will quit also, it will be a crypto exodus.
832 2018-11-14 22:44:49 Did anyone actually watch the video ? The person doesn’t say anything about crypto being in financial crisis LOL

834 2018-11-14 22:44:36 Nope, if btc down due bch hardfork then bch should rise by now..it isn't
835 2018-11-14 22:44:33 It comes down to a function of hardware and computational efficiency - not to mention energy crypto prices. But yeah, the avg consumer is priced out of mining.

862 2018-11-14 22:42:46 Who the fuck will be willing to spend tokens to get informations on the goods they buy ? Nobody. Plus you don’t need blockchain for this

902 2018-11-14 22:39:42 I don't think tech stocks are anything to do with crypto selloff. I think main reason was not having much volatility in prior weeks, which always ends with a huge volatility. BCH mining issues (some mine BTC as well). And of course stop losses were sitting there for months

907 2018-11-14 22:39:27 Not possible 
908 2018-11-14 22:39:24 Yuf ayaginda da ayakkabi varmis :) 
Ama cocugun kiyafetleri cicekleri ve kendisini carpiyor musun topluyormusun. Ben carpma aldim sen toplama yapiyorsun
909 2018-11-14 22:39:18 meant 75,000* XRP.  Need further distribution from that top 0.01%.... .heavily.
910 2018-11-14 22:39:16 おは新一
911 2018-11-14 22:39:14 Even in the face of what appears to be a $btc catastrophe, I don’t hear BK saying sell. Instead he pitches another crypto which performed almost as bad as $btc today. That is what he does every time he talks about $btc decline. Let’s get real, guys. Go back and chk what you have.
912 2018-11-14 22:39:13 いいか？
913 2018-11-14 22:39:12 Abi dur zaten ortalık karışık 
914 2018-11-14 22:39:12 Yes and no. Not surpassed, just less selloff.
915 2018-11-14 22:39:10 Yeah i saw, i'm happy with stocks and crypto for now, that's enough for me 
916 2018-11-14 22:39:09 ザハとShogunのOTC？
917 2018-11-14 22:39:02 ノリで入ってきて欲しいね！
高齢者の大口喜んで受け入れるぞ
918 2018-11-14 22:38:59 Ya tamam dışarıya verdiği para ve çikolata toplamı 100 tl. Ama yanında da komşusundan aldığı 35 tl var. 100-35=65tl.
919 2018-11-14 22:38:57 めっちゃ納得。形を変えて続くだけですな…
920 2018-11-14 22:38:55 Respect bro .. you called it all along!!
921 2018-11-14 22:38:52 Het is onzin, huidige eid's kunnen niet 100% nagemaakt worden as is, de crypto op de chip zorgt daarvoor. Fake eId herkennen kan door chip uit te lezen (bevat ook de foto). Als deze niet overeen komen heb je een valse. Enkel look-alikes zijn mogelijk. Vingerafdruk? #ikweiger
922 2018-11-14 22:38:51 Who's going to tell him that this is like the 6th crypto market cycle in 10 years?
923 2018-11-14 22:38:46 Oui ce fork n'est vraiment pas un événement si banal que cela. Il sera intéressant d'en faire le bilan dans une semaine et de retracer toutes ses incidences quand nous y verrons clair.
924 2018-11-14 22:38:42 Crypto bleeds today.
925 2018-11-14 22:38:40 All I could take was bla, bla, "dead". Bla, bla, "manipulated". Come on my friend. Don't be a sheep, be water. :) - Just kidding mate, this is me just sharing an idea. So I can come back in two months and say "I TOLD YOU SUCKERS". 
926 2018-11-14 22:38:38 おはぎゃぎゃぎゃです！
927 2018-11-14 22:38:38 What’s your advice on transaction aggregation? What system software do you use?
928 2018-11-14 22:38:36 How’s that gonna happen when they both block crypto purchase. ESP Visa I know for sure.
929 2018-11-14 22:38:36 that looks very nice
930 2018-11-14 22:38:34 Of of of  yapma gözünü seveyim.. :((((
931 2018-11-14 22:38:33 イーサリアムめたくそ買っていいか？
932 2018-11-14 22:38:23 I thought Q4 was suppose to be good for crypto
933 2018-11-14 22:38:21 No one knows, however, $4K is possible. We’re not that far from the recovery phase of the cycle.  My point is bailing out now from crypto space considering it‘s a scam is the dummest thing to do.

935 2018-11-14 22:38:19 The sheer immaturity and ego of few influential crypto community members are embarassing for the rest. The idiotic few, ruins it for the rest. These type of immaturity give the world and govt  ammunition to point fingers and question crypto.
936 2018-11-14 22:38:15 Necro cevabı biliyorsan yaz da millet rahat bi uyku uyusun
937 2018-11-14 22:38:09 @mappopk_crypto Not that you've asked but - music is the only thing I don't like about Aelf's content; only weakness in an otherwise great project & publicity effort. Sorry, had to say - as I am gonna explode if I don't give real feedback.
938 2018-11-14 22:38:09 I lost 15% of my trade thanks to that BS error. It's so nice to see the price falling down a cliff and you can't sell. Never trusting this site again and it's so convenient errors.
939 2018-11-14 22:38:07 Merchants will only have one terminal and it needs to be handheld for all their possible payments options, like now they accept all debit and major cc, apple pay,G pay, other mobile pay solutions apps like Danske Bank mobile pay, next is crypto payments like UTRUST, but how?
940 2018-11-14 22:38:04 Haha. Applicable to both in and outside of crypto 
941 2018-11-14 22:37:53 Standing project, you need to join

943 2018-11-14 22:37:35 わけわからん場末のERC-20トークンICOが、わけわからん場末のERC-721ゲームトークンプレセールになって氾濫しつつある
944 2018-11-14 22:37:32 @c_storry we  the podcasts
945 2018-11-14 22:37:20 Is the rest of the world having as hard a time as us Canadians are, trying to buy in??? I feel this is the biggest issue in crypto right now.  I want to throw 3k at TRX and XRP right now, but actually have NO WAY to do it.  Coinbase and Quadriga don’t work for me anymore.
946 2018-11-14 22:37:19 We know that they take the market wherever they want it.  They want the crypto market down.  They might never allow it to rise.
947 2018-11-14 22:37:18 Love you more 
948 2018-11-14 22:37:14 So you‘re a Nakamoto? 
949 2018-11-14 22:37:11 En 2017, pendant quelques jours BTC plongeait aussi et BCH éclatait tout. A ce que je vois l’histoire d’aujdh y ressemble avec l’équipe de BCH qui menace de dumper tous leurs BTC la veille de son fork. Je ne crois pas au hasard après avoir vu autant de manipulations de marché.

まあ値が軽くなったと言えなくもない。
952 2018-11-14 22:36:54 You can't price anyone out of using xrp as a bridge asset. There is more than likely lots of other ways large banking instituations can gain advantages over smaller ones, in crypto, but that's nothing new.
953 2018-11-14 22:36:49 @StaceyDooley you literally had me ready to pay for Josh's deposit...screaming at the TV for his bank account number and sort code. Great job bringing this to our attention. Hopefully, when I become crypto rich, I'll be able to help.
954 2018-11-14 22:36:42 Airtime extension will help @bitchute but these guys haven't really realized the oppoturnities of crypto and they keep believing in these bad Fiat companies who keep failing them
955 2018-11-14 22:36:40 lol good one. Bitcoin is dead right now. We need some huge volume of people that simply isnt there. It's going to take at least a year IMO to reach 9500 usd again... such depressing markets being manipulated by the whales. And to think that we thought this was decentrilized :(
956 2018-11-14 22:36:40 His sister
957 2018-11-14 22:36:39 Bana animasyon yaptırıp anlattırma şimdi gece gece :)
958 2018-11-14 22:36:38 Hani ekran görüntüsü 
959 2018-11-14 22:36:38 @CharlieCarrel Where do you think the crypto market is headed?
960 2018-11-14 22:36:36 大暴落
961 2018-11-14 22:36:35 You can thank the Bcrash team for bringing Bitcoin down with it. If it wasn't for Bcrash, we'd still be above. Bcrash killed crypto. Thanks Faketoshi and Bitcoin Judas.
962 2018-11-14 22:36:25 I find it so much easier to buy drugs with cash.   But than again , I don’t buy drugs :)
963 2018-11-14 22:36:07 Everyone needs to relax and hodl, the building going on with #Bitcoin is great, and no one is paying any attention to it. It's all about the price, or Crypto Drama.
964 2018-11-14 22:36:06 @ProfFaustus, you are a strong player and personality in the crypto world. Could you financially support our project of creating the History of Bitcoin and building a global Crypto-Encyclopedia?
965 2018-11-14 22:36:02 $186B market cap! Why with all of the recent positive news? I find nothing indicating this downturn. Must be whale manipulation before the pump!
966 2018-11-14 22:36:00 So if Lisa is the real deal, Craig can‘t be Fake(toshi) right? Just connecting the dots 
967 2018-11-14 22:35:57 Hahaha iyi guldum
968 2018-11-14 22:35:51 today in ''only in crypto''
969 2018-11-14 22:35:47 Hedge funds always had the ability but tomorrow is last call..... Then the slow influx of money into crypto
970 2018-11-14 22:35:41 90% of twitter should not be in crypto...listening to the feeds today.  If you lose it all it should not matter, its high risk high rewards, so I agree, people get int expecting to be rich in 6 days.... GREED will be tehir downfall usually.
971 2018-11-14 22:35:35 Invest in crypto
972 2018-11-14 22:35:30 I bought the dip, 72 timesso far.
973 2018-11-14 22:35:30 Same. I remember the same happened on 5th Feb 2018
974 2018-11-14 22:35:30 Bitcoin will light my @Trezor :)
975 2018-11-14 22:35:14 Definitely worth preparing for next year Bro!  I sat on the side lines with Canadian MJ, but they made crypto 2017 level gains 
976 2018-11-14 22:35:14 I also was hesitant but gave in right beofre first 1b airdrop. So so glad I did 
977 2018-11-14 22:35:11 Today I lost more money in crypto by selling the bottom! Soon i will buy the top!!

987 2018-11-14 22:34:27 [Turns on television]

990 2018-11-14 22:34:24 People are hilarious. Huge crypto sell off because, bitcoin cash is splitting tomorrow. It like an auto sell-off due to a Maytag split.
991 2018-11-14 22:34:21 Im actually happy crypto went down 
992 2018-11-14 22:34:20 bu adam iyiymiş...:)
993 2018-11-14 22:34:17 Ama para bozdururken komşusundan aldığı gerçek 35 tl halen adamın yanında
994 2018-11-14 22:34:12 So the Hodlers, the people who believe in the future legitimacy of BTC and crypto as whole and who decrease supply and increase demand by buying and holding those coins are the problem?

998 2018-11-14 22:33:39 Omg here come the dumbass xrp fan boys.  I have them both showing a little over 9% down in the last 24 hours.  Let me guess xrp to $600 right?
999 2018-11-14 22:33:34 i give it ten years lol
1000 2018-11-14 22:33:32 She is Lisa the real macoy!!! ( it’s a saying in the US, so you might not get it) meaning she is the real deal!!

1004 2018-11-14 22:33:18 J'imagine ! Merci pour ce témoignage ! C'est super intéressant et plein d'apprentissage. La maîtrise de ses émotions passe parfois par couper le lien avec ces émotions justement.
Merci. 
1005 2018-11-14 22:33:12 #Crypto-currencies including #BITCOIN were massacred today. Lack of liquidity. We will now  see many of these fictitious "stores of value" go to ZERO as I predicted one year ago. It was a  con from the beginning and now the support has been removed as the scam  is up.
1006 2018-11-14 22:33:08 I could Flip A quarter and Be Right More Times than You.
1007 2018-11-14 22:32:56 Never liked it, just grab another basket, coming to long term again 
1008 2018-11-14 22:32:48 Hiç birşey karşılığında müşteriye 35 tl'lik çikolata ve 15 lira para vermiş. Öbür adama da 50 verdi. Toplam zarar 65 tl + 35 TL'lik çikolata = 100 TL
1009 2018-11-14 22:32:45 Great to have finally met you guys too!!   And thanks for all your tools and strong work supporting the network!  
1010 2018-11-14 22:32:37 Glad to finally see some life on $crypto Twitter!

1014 2018-11-14 22:32:24 Crypto is in financial crisis?  There is no crisis. Just reverting to real value. Zero. Is she implying Bitcoin is like Amazon more like Pets dot com.
1015 2018-11-14 22:32:21 he is botting... I used to do it too - mass unfollow, mas follow, he keeps no memory of who he followed before
1016 2018-11-14 22:32:07 Bitcoin dump makes absolutely no sense but there again this is crypto & the opposite of what you expect usually happens. Maybe we should all play to lose, probably end up rich 
1017 2018-11-14 22:32:04 @tcrypto94 I want to know why it’s a bad idea...
1018 2018-11-14 22:32:04 @mappopk_crypto more great events coming our way; thank you
1019 2018-11-14 22:31:54 Is $XRP pumping to $589?

1022 2018-11-14 22:31:38 In learning theory, to use dotcom bubble as an analog to crypto bubble amounts to an one trial learning, absolutely unscientific at all
1023 2018-11-14 22:31:36 What news Irish girl? To get you riled up to buy crypto.
1024 2018-11-14 22:31:34 So if Craig is Satoshi Nakamoto, who is Lisa? 
1025 2018-11-14 22:31:34 Wow.  Only 70,000 XRP to be in top 1%!?  Crazy.
1026 2018-11-14 22:31:33 Hey birb! Longtime fan and follower. How high do you think the bounce is going to be?
1027 2018-11-14 22:31:29 You quit your job before you started being profitable?
1028 2018-11-14 22:31:29 senerの件でも話題になってたましたが。
ビットコインは金融商品じゃないから

今後もビットコイン含め仮想通貨の取引が無くなることはありません。
金融商品として認め取締りを強化する方が良いのです

1031 2018-11-14 22:31:21 Since July, I have took a hard stance on @coinbase, they have not and will not be getting any commission off my crypto purchases until they list XRP. Once they do, I’ll surely forgive them, it’s a great app.

1035 2018-11-14 22:30:59 What the fuck are we doing ?
1036 2018-11-14 22:30:57 @EthereumAddict come back bro we miss you
1037 2018-11-14 22:30:52 Well I hope not
1038 2018-11-14 22:30:49 This one never gets old..
1039 2018-11-14 22:30:41 Wow that is great to know
1040 2018-11-14 22:30:41 When @kazonomics warned you about crypto being in a fractal version of the dot com bubble you said he was crazy... Turns out he was 100% right including dates and %s. He kept nailing his calls during the entire 2018. You are just salty cause you were on the wrong side of his TA!
1041 2018-11-14 22:30:40 ben farklı bir boyut kazandırıp 85 Tl diyorum :D
1042 2018-11-14 22:30:31 No wonder he doesn't like Bitcoin
1043 2018-11-14 22:30:31 Live now on @CNBC - tune in to watch @Melt_Dem talk crypto markets and where we go from here with the @CNBCFastMoney crew.
1044 2018-11-14 22:30:28 I can show you plenty of mine that don’t work out....
1045 2018-11-14 22:30:18 J’ai arrêté de checker les courbes constamment au bureau. On avait pas d’app mobile, donc une petite boule au ventre en ouvrant Paymium.
J’ai vendu une partie de mon portefeuille à perte et je suis revenu quelques mois plus tard. Passage quasi obligatoire pour réussir.

1049 2018-11-14 22:29:55 That's it Udi - every single person in crypto that isn't working on Bitcoin is attempting to commit fraud.

This is the type of thought leading I come on Twitter for.
1050 2018-11-14 22:29:54 If you are a long term investor in #cryptos and you belive in cryptocurrencies you do not have  fear in these moments. 
That's the market. A market in his early stage.

The ongoing war in Yemen:
"If we use the official Saudi narrative about crypto-Persians, then what’s happening in #Yemen is #genocide against #Persians."
1054 2018-11-14 22:29:39 It's a judgement day, not crypto combustion! let's see who has the strong pegs.. $btc / $xrp / $bch / $eth or ...?
1055 2018-11-14 22:29:39 ヒュー⤵︎⤵︎⤵︎
1056 2018-11-14 22:29:27 It’s not an issue because we setup systems that lock the LTC/BTC payment in when it’s processed at the US Dollar amount and fund US Dollar to the bank account. Me personally I keep all the crypto I get for Payments, but I can set it up either way for the business.
1057 2018-11-14 22:29:25 You know what they say about eggs in a basket.  Never hurts to play multiple angles. It’s like a portfolio... diversification is key.
1058 2018-11-14 22:29:19 If one man has that much power to destroy bitcoin then we should all go back to sleep.

1065 2018-11-14 22:28:46 Well... Big hands have been holding for some time now. So maybe more logical than we think? Just saying that whales control this unfortunately and I don't see it changing. Until it changes, crypto isn't going anywhere.

1083 2018-11-14 22:27:03 Definition of trust: „If you trust someone, you believe that they are honest and sincere and will not deliberately do anything to harm you.“ What are examples taken from your daily life in which you need to trust someone? #crypto #cryptocurrencies
1084 2018-11-14 22:27:01 It reminds me of a Universal Basic Income via crypto.  That is my first take on it...registration is seemingly required for UBI services globally.  I have to assume it runs on a blockchain or other similar very hard to hack ledger that maintains the balances properly.

1088 2018-11-14 22:26:37 Thank you
1089 2018-11-14 22:26:34 So ETH is under pre-bubble levels. The price has been dancing around the last level of the retracement, on a downtrend since the dollar rise began. 
The stock market is showing signs of forming an iH&S, and I can't really fathom going any longer at this point.
1090 2018-11-14 22:26:28 Hey man I'm not trying to be cheeky or anything, I just don't understand what you are measuring as down 20% when you just write 'crypto'. Market cap?
1091 2018-11-14 22:26:27 @koheitokumasu hey Mister Tokumasu, I'd like to get in touch with you regarding your participation in the Viva La Crypto conference in Mexico next week.

1094 2018-11-14 22:25:52 I'm only down 200 so far, and none of it is in stable coins. However if bch replaces btc I'm jumping off a high building. Every time I sell, my shit pops leaving only regret. Crypto is not my job so loss affects me a lot less than traders. A better investment may have been drugs.

1098 2018-11-14 22:25:25 $btc price goes up: cool, my BTC is worth more now. Btc price goes down: cool, BTC is cheap now and I can buy more. I don't see the problem? #Crypto
1099 2018-11-14 22:25:24 No, while this was a bad move, it shouldn’t be held over their heads for life.

But how do u sell the volatility issue to merchants who are thinking about accepting crypto payments?

1115 2018-11-14 22:23:38 After that dip today, it was the first time since march, that i traded in a (for me) bigger scale. Just transferred some Fiat money into btc. Unfortunately i don't have more to put in, but i bought some of my favorite longterms & some highly speculative coins as ZER, TRTL, RSTER
1116 2018-11-14 22:23:35 Yes. The equal weighted liquid crypto universe

1147 2018-11-14 22:20:12 What is his problem? Did BTC hurt his feelings or what?
1148 2018-11-14 22:20:09 I admire #crypto bulls. Facing immense losses, they've got it totally wrong all year, another 15% loss in just a few hours & they are still bullish, still calling the market higher on Twitter.  #goingbankrupt
1149 2018-11-14 22:20:05 This is all Craig Wright. He's threatened to dump on the market if miners support BCH. That's litterally extortion.

1153 2018-11-14 22:19:39 On the one end, investigative journalism like @amaBhungane is incredibly valuable to society, but needs a new business model. Crypto-patronage? On the other end of the spectrum the @Medium monetisation model is awesome, but proof would be in the scaling.
1154 2018-11-14 22:19:37 Funny how crypto twitter went “no Bitcoin is fine no scams here” to “Bitcoin ded, RSI ded, crypto ded, capitulation”. 

Just be patient and stay off twitter. Dont forget these are the same morons who bought the 20k top.

1158 2018-11-14 22:19:17 econoar People have a tough time comparing different metrics across different cryptocurrencies. We thought by making BTC a benchmark it allows people to have a gauge to measure against.

If coins have scored above BTC, they will be shown as larger than 100%. #crypto #cryptoc…

1165 2018-11-14 22:18:49 My play was to convert my remaining BTC to BCH when it reaches 4800 or lower because the market is correlated and so it would be a good opportunity. This fork complicates matters a little.
1166 2018-11-14 22:18:47 I don't know who recommended u, but I definitely follow too many hopium dealers 
1167 2018-11-14 22:18:41 Thats's the famous #PoW ?

Hopefully this is the day, the #crypto world realizes LPoS
(Liquid Proof of Stake) is the way to go.

1169 2018-11-14 22:18:38 The revolution is here yet, as @CryptoBridge is operating very well. The next step imo are decentralized privatly exchanges like @zdexexchange where you will be trading against the untracable / unlinked #zpiv coins by the @_pivx network. And that milestone is only weeks away.

1172 2018-11-14 22:18:06 To be fair, @Nouriel is a fish out of the water on twitter. I think his grudge with the crypto community has more to do with hate vs systems similar to those that adhere to the gold standard, or commodity backed currencies, sound money etc. He should stick to books and lookers.

1206 2018-11-14 22:15:04 @Ripple #XRP is now the Number 2 Crypto Currency in the world. I've got a feeling this time, it will stick longer as one of the only currencies with a real world use case
1207 2018-11-14 22:14:46 You don’t advertise your full time job cause you work a 9-5 clearly

1215 2018-11-14 22:13:50 To be quite honest, I'm glad there's finally a bit of drama in #Bitcoin...

I was getting tired of positive #news on #Crypto in 2018 not affecting price.. 

Back in the day: good #BTC news = movement and bad #BTC news = more movement.

1236 2018-11-14 22:11:57 Once upon a time ... 1999 ... crypto was still a "munition" according to the NSA.  No wonder Satoshi and Hal worked underground.

1238 2018-11-14 22:11:34 So a hashwar is the best way to determine things? No concern about community and users who can't take part? Where is the nuance in discussion and negotiation? Unless you're saying none of that is worthwhile.

1253 2018-11-14 22:10:16 1: @ProfFaustus Craig didn’t cause this.
2: If BTC fails, all crypto fails. But who cares about the actual use cases of helping people oppressed by their governments and banks.
3: Who wants to do business with someone responsible for wiping away billions.
1254 2018-11-14 22:10:10 it is possible the best #AI was created by biology though natural selection. At least for sure the best at surviving and reproducing. But who is best at #dance and #crypto trading?
1255 2018-11-14 22:10:03 Agreed. I saw a headline somewhere earlier about a “crypto bloodbath.” As a long-term investor, I prefer to look at it as a “marketwide sale.” It’s a great opportunity to accumulate some solid, yet undervalued coins.
1256 2018-11-14 22:09:59 Sooner or later we will need to test $6k range to confirm a S/R flip. Would be funny, yet not surprising if that happens before the daily close. $BTC #cryptoconfessions #crypto #REKT

1259 2018-11-14 22:09:56 Asin, if investors decide to cut their losses on crypto because of fears over the continuous downtrend, it is infact more likely to continue dropping.
1260 2018-11-14 22:09:54 Sure, but most of this year was odd. We usually see tons of moves up and down like this when things are hot. Just another day in crypto prior to the past 3 months.
1261 2018-11-14 22:09:50 Yaşlılık işte 
1262 2018-11-14 22:09:46 I've been into crypto since before #bitcoin even existed.  Alas, I'm still not rich because I spent more than I saved.  But I still am happy to have participated pretty early on.  Thanks to #TheCreatureFromJekyllIsland @redpillexpo
1263 2018-11-14 22:09:40 1) is definitely happening right now. They cant push the peg to 1. The only way to do that is to buy/redeem USDT with USD. They don't have any USD. They have to sell crypto to raise USD which crashes crypto prices. Eventually they'll probably tell everyone their USDT is worthless

1279 2018-11-14 22:08:45 I felt recently you would leave since you had so much interest in crypto and other projects. I am a bit disturbed now by this departure on top of that problematic dividended that seemed out of place.

1295 2018-11-14 22:07:14 Unfortunately, like crypto, it's going to take a lot of people to get on board with this idea before it's viable and effective.
1296 2018-11-14 22:07:13 Right but this isn’t even crypto so what is it?
1297 2018-11-14 22:07:07 I've been doing a crypto review of ProgPOW.
Definitely "ASIC-able". Will send details and suggested fixes to the ifdefelse team shortly...
1298 2018-11-14 22:07:05 I love @elonmusk's ideas and I genuinely want him to succeed, but he needs more butt-whoopins. He's not owed a gold-laden path to success. He should fight and fight hard for what he wants to build. Right now, everyone is bending over backwards and forwards for him. No crying.
1299 2018-11-14 22:06:54 Tu as raison mais je pense les enjeux que la crypto sont maintenant sont assez "importante". Un btc qui continue a chuté beaucoup trop bas, je ne pense pas que c'est quel que chose de positif. Comment prendre au sérieux un marché aussi instable alors que alors que pour beaucoup

1350 2018-11-14 22:03:08 That's a load of crap, nChain filed a dozen of patents and want to control the closed source software. I don't want to be permissioned to develop.
1351 2018-11-14 22:03:04 @Crypto_Kane4 bro you saved my skin telling me to sell up everything 3 days ago as a huge dump was coming. How did you know? Should i buy back in now and get like 20% more or wait?

1360 2018-11-14 22:02:47 @BitcoinBirch , @Cryptonary_  any suggestions for crypto integrated payment for my website ??
1361 2018-11-14 22:02:46 Yes.  Early crypto giveaways turned into some serious money.  This is an interesting one because it has big backers.  If it becomes worth something, I'll pay some taxes on it and use it, maybe they'll partner with TaxAct and it'll be automatic. lol.
1362 2018-11-14 22:02:42 Dear Faketoshi you have just proved that BTC and its variaties are shitcoin and please do sell whatever you have AND dump all of us. Yet, Crypto will survive and be stronger without a school-bullied kid like you! You think your shitcoin is the only crytpo? no use case no adoption

1367 2018-11-14 22:02:16 очень хороший проект
1368 2018-11-14 22:02:11 Maybe big bcash players like Craig Wright dumped their remaining BTC to weaken it, before the bcash fork. It‘s all about building a narrative.
1369 2018-11-14 22:02:03 Great meeting w/ Ty. Definitely ahead of the game as a WM asset manager who see’s the future of crypto assets and tech.

1372 2018-11-14 22:01:52 That's why crypto never would be regulated and accepted . countries wouldn't let some fuckers to play with world economy .Everything is like a game to this people and that's because they control so many coins and so much money. crypto is turning to a joke.
1373 2018-11-14 22:01:50 Relax, all I see is @crypto_son bot tweeting about people buying $XRP

1415 2018-11-14 21:58:30 the risk that 4 of 5 coins go to zero ? if you picking your bags that bad maybe you should switch to shorting.
1416 2018-11-14 21:58:28 Think about it this way, if you had only been watching the chart for a whole year and not reading crypto-twitter, and you knew how to trade a triangle, there is no way you didn't see this coming.
1417 2018-11-14 21:58:25 $BTC dump more than 800usd in one day and i only missed 3 followers?

1418 2018-11-14 21:58:22 I don’t care about this drop. $btc dominance will drop sooner or later and alts will pump your portfolio’s btc value.

1470 2018-11-14 21:54:25 I feel that as more stable coins get pairings with ALTs, we'll see less and less selloff of ALT_X with Bitcoin drops. There are so many fanatics of certain coins that refuse to let go of their preciously held shitcoins. That sort of cult holding might lead to less selloffs.

1474 2018-11-14 21:54:14 It's mostly $XRP that looks bullish and has the appropriate fundamentals to start the bull.
1475 2018-11-14 21:54:12 just waiting for tomorrow's dump on big caps
1476 2018-11-14 21:54:10 I like lending platforms for the long term. #Lend #Salt and #Nexo are my top picks. Now which one is going to go or are all of them that remains to be seen.
1477 2018-11-14 21:54:05 Good luck!
1478 2018-11-14 21:54:01 I rely on @ummjackson for my crypto analysis but so far he's not offered any explanation, how lazy of him :-p
1479 2018-11-14 21:53:58 PSA: you're never going to understand anything in the crypto space until you stop letting yourself be trolled and triggered by @ProfFaustus. The info you need is all there but you can't absorb it when you're running in circles with your hair on fire.
1480 2018-11-14 21:53:51 Same mate. I did not like the KYC part too and that was the only reason i did not buy to begin with. I think @Official_IGG are doing a fantastic job so i submitted my KYC yesterday and picked up some $IGG a little while ago 
1481 2018-11-14 21:53:49 Provavelmente. O que te posso dizer e que "em princípio" quem se chibou lá dentro nem e sócio da juve e nem sequer do Sporting. Tanto pro musta como pro Bdc. Podem portanto serem simples adeptos do SCP. Ou de outros.nao tomes esta informação como garantida.
1482 2018-11-14 21:53:42 there's a lot of crypto money of people who don't *quite* understand crypto. So this could just be simple panic / conservativism.
1483 2018-11-14 21:53:41 My crypto portfolio is getting dangerously close to my original investment. Why didn't I take some profit in January?
1484 2018-11-14 21:53:39 Somebody for the love of God explain to me what happened while i was out studying? What is this carnage? 14% drop in mere hours? Also whats good with binance? I SHOULD HAVE MADE A STOP LOSS ORDER!!!! But binance doesn't work per CT #btc #bitcoin #crypto

1489 2018-11-14 21:53:01 is there a upper bound of how much losses of crypto that can offsets other gains in a year
1490 2018-11-14 21:52:57 Despite the carnage across crypto markets and oil, great to see the iron ore price consistently hit higher lows and higher highs.
1491 2018-11-14 21:52:54 This is great theater. BTC wins and will continue to win as all true believers knew/know. The big crypto implosion may be upon us sooner than I thought. Can't happen soon enough as far as I'm concerned.

1512 2018-11-14 21:51:10 Come on man. It was to show how their strategy is shifting from crypto-to-crypto to unaffiliated fiat-to-crypto exchanges combined with DEX. And now as they comply more than before and start shifting into the new strategy, they will be tougher to chase by regulators/authorities
1513 2018-11-14 21:51:06 well, in that case, let us hope everything goes as planned
1514 2018-11-14 21:51:00 Will be sub $3k before the bears are done.
1515 2018-11-14 21:50:58 I’m glad I sold ETH @ 850.00 and LTC @ $300.  But I believe LTC goes under $30. Poor crypto souls  Biggest Organized Ponzi Scheme of All Time..

1517 2018-11-14 21:50:43 can crypto losses offset gains from stock or salary income
1518 2018-11-14 21:50:37 Haha 1/3, 1/3, 1,3 seems about right

1520 2018-11-14 21:50:36 Lmao.
1521 2018-11-14 21:50:34 The crypto market will continue to be lackluster for bulls until May 2019 (at the latest). Bullish uptrend into the "disbelief" phase roughly ~12months before the 2020 block reward halving. Same as 2011&  2015.

1538 2018-11-14 21:49:39 Honestly I think people in crypto like to hide behind Medium posts instead of sticking their neck out there in real time where responses can't be managed and pre-planned. I don't think many crypto people are good w/ confrontation, thinking on their feet, or shooting from the hip.

Sidebar: We both agreed it’s still very early. For example, $AAPL’s cash is greater than the whole crypto market.

1545 2018-11-14 21:49:22 My only regret about this dip is that I don't have any extra resources to buy more XRP, when something like this happens where the whole crypto space suffers I can only think of price manipulation for new players to come in

We better be OVER $BTC $6K by Sunday, on the Weekly close, or we will continue down for sure.

1556 2018-11-14 21:48:46 That xrp part just turned me off 
1557 2018-11-14 21:48:45 sry i can't read
1558 2018-11-14 21:48:36 Yeah I suspect all of crypto will be paying close attention, for a large variety of reasons. 

Mostly I'm looking forward to seeing if the original Bitcoin will ever reach its true potential in the face of such adversary.

Feels like last chance saloon and high noon approaching.
1559 2018-11-14 21:48:34 On the state of the market from lessons learnt today I can only say one thing: 

There is massive interest in crypto from traditional markets - IMO people with a low time preference, who invested in long term real life utility will be profitable - today’s prices are irrelevant.
1560 2018-11-14 21:48:29 Awesome project

1588 2018-11-14 21:46:40 Out of almost all $alts, too much uncertainty. Letting the dust settle at least until daily close, more likely until weekly close. Close above 5450 for $btc makes it look less awful, close above 5850 and I may actually be a buyer. Generally my area of interest is >5850 or <4800.

1632 2018-11-14 21:44:38 How is possible that crypto can depend on some dirty little rat
1633 2018-11-14 21:44:37 Unless you actually LOST it playing the Bitmex Videogame
1634 2018-11-14 21:44:37 Knock on wood, but I think today's sell-off was necessary and may be the catalyst (or 1 of the main catalysts) to get the momentum necessary for a bull run... $btc $eth #crypto

1651 2018-11-14 21:43:29 I am however loving the strong fight #xrp is putting up. Recovering faster than any other crypto it seems.

1658 2018-11-14 21:42:55 By "backing" a coin with social network activity, you'd solve the main problem of the social network (ad-support makes toxic administration inevitable) and the main problem of crypto. (no practical way to connect mundane activity and stored value)
1659 2018-11-14 21:42:49 OMG - I'm trying to figure out all the crypto I'm going to buy! #XRP, that's for sure.

1664 2018-11-14 21:42:23 This is the first day in a long time that $crypto twitter has been decent.

1669 2018-11-14 21:41:56 The discussion was about the traditional markets not crypto

Getting emotional about todays drop means U Have too much invested
1674 2018-11-14 21:41:16 I don’t trust rsi when crypto is crashing like this
1675 2018-11-14 21:41:11 Seeing a lot of the same chart analysis on twitter re #bitcoin #btc #xtb #Crypto . Strange.
1676 2018-11-14 21:40:53 If these guys dont care about the average Joe in the space and fight, crash the market, do what the establishment hasn't done to the crypto space..

1687 2018-11-14 21:39:56 Paypal doesn't like anythinf related to crypto. Seen this happen a lot now. @Nickfost_
1688 2018-11-14 21:39:53 No excuse to not get into the crypto of your choice after the bitcoin sell off. This could help spark that Bull Run we've been waiting for. 
  Great time to get some #xlm. With the possibility still for a coinbase add, you may have the opportunity to make a little extra!

1691 2018-11-14 21:39:37 Oh i bought the dip with some voting rewards within a couple hours of  people were saying it was a scam as  I couldn't see any proof, flipped it for a nice 250%...  Ok with gambling on something like that but i want a foundation if I'm going to "invest" .
1692 2018-11-14 21:39:35 The flippening just happened. #XRP replaces #ETH as the #2 market cap crypto. #XRP holds it value relative to #BTC today. #XRP is looking strong on the chart too.

1697 2018-11-14 21:39:14 1/ I have people panicking and emailing me, and saying all things about crypto, and emotional. These are people with too much money invested in crypto. If you are panicked and emotional about today's drop I would say get out and find a hobby.

1700 2018-11-14 21:38:57 The value added by cryptocurrency as a concept is meaningless to the public unless you find a way to introduce a coin that they are *already somehow using.* This is why a twitter-like in a crypto-blockchain seems interesting.
1701 2018-11-14 21:38:49 Crypto dead? JOE, c'mon man. You know that is NOT possible. Digital Assetts are the NEW assetts and they will become the norm. The ETF approval is probably the reason for this massive dip. The whales are communicating and they know the SEC is going to approve it. (Guessing)
1702 2018-11-14 21:38:48 How does a tsunami begin? From what I can see there was similar activity prior to last years bull run, which I got into too late I’m ready this time
1703 2018-11-14 21:38:47 Naah bruh, just quit job, rented crazy expensive apartment and office plus starting a company with funda I don't have bu hey... Ordinary life of a crypto ropewalker right? :)
1704 2018-11-14 21:38:47 Seriously. Undress from speculator|visionaire (as we all are) and wear some economic style clothes. Whats the reason behind holding $btc or any other #crypto?
1705 2018-11-14 21:38:37 i personally find the bitcoind code is easy to understand in terms of *implementation*, but not *intent*

1708 2018-11-14 21:38:17 All the fighting in #crypto is dust in the wind if the result of the war is not new consensus but superfluous forks supported by ever more disgust towards one another. On-chain governance is both the answer and the solution. In the digital age we ALL ought to have a say. #XTZ

1711 2018-11-14 21:38:02 Yes every crypto community member and coin have a different speciality but we need to understand that we all have the same goal, mass adoption of crypto and thus FREEDOM. Together we are stronger so stop throwing mud at each other #bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #Cryptocurrency
1712 2018-11-14 21:37:56 Well guess that was crypto...sad day. I guess it’s back to the chequebook.

1713 2018-11-14 21:37:46 as someone who is not proficient in Go (and had never written any when i read btcd), i found the intent of the btcd code more clear

1718 2018-11-14 21:37:22 Same thing happened with the coinbase bch listing.
1719 2018-11-14 21:37:19 You are probably right. I am not talking about price though, I am talking about attitude, spirit of crypto, treating people correctly, and not letting your ego harm what should be everybody's mission in crypto and that is adoption. These people do not care.

1726 2018-11-14 21:36:39 The fall is more related to time dynamic and news are retro explanations,  but it's fall because bottom was not in and it's has to fall,  it's just starting...

With the growth of tron, the transaction rates and the dex fees the #TRX block rewards are going to run themselves and provide plenty to burn in the future.

1764 2018-11-14 21:32:21 There is too much utility in crypto currencies for them to go away. And global fiat is being abused to extraordinary degrees. 

A flight from fiat is coming. Economist mag cover in 1988 predicted 2018. Looks like 2019 will be the year of new currencies.

1777 2018-11-14 21:30:56 Yes we are  Even tho I hold limited BTC it affects the whole market still hurts. The only reason I commented in the first place was because crypto macro called him delusional. So called him out.
1778 2018-11-14 21:30:54 Caelum is finally starting to establish a price. Buy and sell orders are starting to meet at $0.17. Great start for an easily mineable token. However it's too low to tempt me to sell. The potential is too great! #caelumproject #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #crypto #cryptotrading #eth
1779 2018-11-14 21:30:52 Millions getting moved from wallets yesterday then this dump today! 
Manipulation at its best! The quicker institutional money comes into crypto and real use the better. 
1780 2018-11-14 21:30:51 That's because XRP hodlers know how to HODL strong. This war between Craig and Roger Ver over control of hash rate power will most likely make people see that premined crypto are the future lol
1781 2018-11-14 21:30:50 I will DAB to that..

What's the best crypto conference you've been to this year so far?
1815 2018-11-14 21:27:44 I’m fine with crypto that rewards users. But to reward user, this crypto should have real monetary value. If you token model is “well, people just buy crypto”, then you’re doomed in the long-run.
1816 2018-11-14 21:27:41 lol. i got in Nov last year.  im still here.  But the dumb money is lonnnnnng gone.
1817 2018-11-14 21:27:28 hope dies last! #Bullswillrunagain
1818 2018-11-14 21:27:24 I definitely think this is a shake out. 

Big buy orders out numbering sell orders. 

Debating on deleting my crypto apps and just holding. Maybe I will open them on Christmas Day. Could be the best or worst present ever 
1819 2018-11-14 21:27:20 Double whammy!!!

1821 2018-11-14 21:27:14 Ze willen ons bang maken of het is hun tactiek om weer goedkoper in te kopen. Dit is naar mij idéé  afgesproken alles zakt in nu, sommige crypto,s staan op -23%. We overleven dit ook wel weer. Ik zeg maar zo riemen vast en gaan.
1822 2018-11-14 21:27:00 Lol. From your mouth to the god of crypto. He will answer in due time.
1823 2018-11-14 21:26:56 Yes, it's a flaw. Today, we're only using the dominant repo for each crypto asset. 

This has to do with just the overall dev time investment and wanting a simple V1 launch. It's important to note Lightning is also excluded.

Which repos would you add for ethereum?
1824 2018-11-14 21:26:53 Whoa, crypto taking a bath today.

1827 2018-11-14 21:26:33 Lets FINALLY mature this #crypto market and decouple #alts from #BTC.. let the BTC independent real use cases flourish!! Stop the suffering and BTC suppression..

1836 2018-11-14 21:25:53 Governments in capitalist countries are super-reluctant to *completely* shut down anything that might be a new financial instrument. But they do act against blatant crooks. So we see the slow and gradual regulation of the crypto economy.
1837 2018-11-14 21:25:50 The impact of aging on society at large is considered to be negative, I think, mainly because no one really wants to grow old. To realize positives of an aging population, we may need to come to terms with our own fading youth. #populationhealth #healthcare

1852 2018-11-14 21:24:01 For the 10000000”th time and last time.. where do you think the volume is coming from before EOY. Answer 1 question just 1
1853 2018-11-14 21:24:01 This narrative makes me cringe. There are so many moving parts to this. And there is also a lot of foresight regards the way Dave Kleiman feels about Craig’s motives and management style.
1854 2018-11-14 21:23:57 Are you gonna clean up CCTL as well? That has a huge opportunity because it is involved in crypto.

1857 2018-11-14 21:23:31 The abc/sv #HashWar is being funded by liquidating #Crypto to #BTC to fiat to pay for more hash power. Traders follow the trend. If support is broken, you can accumulate and #hodl more #bitcoin

1887 2018-11-14 21:20:51 It does to the extend people believe it. In the short term at least. Until people realize that it does not. But people a clueless about crypto so that might take a while.

1894 2018-11-14 21:19:58 A fairly common concern for investors in projects outside of the US is that SEC has not ruled in either direction as to whether a given crypto asset is a security. Could you give some insight as to what power (if any) the SEC has over them?
1895 2018-11-14 21:19:57 Well she should use the Delta app to track crypto and not rely on your text. That’s what my wife does. Anyway, great time to buy more bitcoin.

1904 2018-11-14 21:19:25 Source?
1905 2018-11-14 21:19:22 That’s a great point. People over rely on these metrics that are vulnerable to distortion and that works just fine in most markets but often break under the pressure of crypto swings.
1906 2018-11-14 21:19:11 Remember this time last year when everyone in the world turned into a crypto day trader and now it isn't worth more than a used subway ticket. That was fun.

1912 2018-11-14 21:18:49 Ok. Say you have $100 and loses 95%. Now you have 5dolla. Now you can lose 10% of that value = 4.5dolla. it not mean you got negative 5doh, the sad part bull is what massive percentage increase you need to get back to 100 dolls. Being a bull u above the laws of cryptophysics tho
1913 2018-11-14 21:18:47 Yeah I've just been very pessimistic lately b/c it really seems like the moment you do anything fun, someone has to come fuck you into the dirt.

I just wish a company could come by and offer a not-lame social media experience without the logical conclusion being crypto-exclusive

1918 2018-11-14 21:18:25 One of the things I've learned in crypto is those people are not looking for truths. They are looking for someone to tell them what they want to hear. I had a friend not talk to me for a month because when he said Bitcoin would be 40,000 by EOY, I laughed and said maybe Peso"s

1925 2018-11-14 21:18:02 you can probably make 0.04 cents on the dollar if you buy tethers right now
1926 2018-11-14 21:17:50 Crypto can stay irrational longer then you can stay sane in the membrane? I remember there was a quote like this. Aylmao. $btc

Centralized framed brains 
No one of you (BTC-BCH-and some others 2) will not survive in future cryptpspace(s).
Most of the current known cryptos will break her own neck just for one simple failure. so keep cool and enjoy the show

1932 2018-11-14 21:17:27 I saw that too & it's a "yes but no" my friend because technically the daily candle hasn't closed yet. 
1933 2018-11-14 21:17:25 #ProjectDELTA #Blockchain #Crypto
Very high quality and reliable project. The team is working efficiently. Responsible for the task. There is a great prospect in the draft
1934 2018-11-14 21:17:20 fair enough
1935 2018-11-14 21:17:20 The thing is, the price is up 300percent  so nobody should've lost money because you can simply sell right now. If you hold and loose at this point, it's on you. I've not seen proof either but i sold mine and bought #IGG which i know is good and i'm up 120% , so why take chance?

1941 2018-11-14 21:16:51 More than money, if crypto dies, my biggest loss would be the time I spent on it each and everyday for the last year. The thing is, the time I spent doing my own research made me sure that crypto will never die. #BTC #BITCOIN #cryptocurrencies

1944 2018-11-14 21:16:25 We entered the crypto to be further away from a corrupt banking and government machine. What did we get? We got a few bastards with dictator ambitions. PS Apparently they have small penises.

2013 2018-11-14 21:11:55 Prediction: You will only take two more L's in your entire career. Both will happen 3 years from now. The first is Barkley over Darnold, after the Giants find a good QB. The second one is your stance on Crypto!

2023 2018-11-14 21:11:12 Holding crypto has been brutal.

2041 2018-11-14 21:09:56 In that case that’s the function of every single large or medium cap crypto. The founders/early miners all get rich, as they hold large bags and dump them whenever they feel like it.

Друзья, на рынке чрезмерная паника (FUD), у многих стратегии нарушены и послетали стопы, объемы торгов низкие, мы это видим, поэтому за этим panic sell стоят конкретные люди, которые идут к своец цели таким вот образом.

2100 2018-11-14 21:04:59 One of the things that I think is important is sharing honestly what works and what doesn't about crypto.  

And for the record I want to say that I have a ton of respect for each and every crypto team that is building a product with real users.  So much work goes into it. 
2101 2018-11-14 21:04:56 At this point of time I don’t even care I’ve survived all the crashes of 2018 and I’m still HODLing! Crypto and blockchain are here to stay! And I’ll be locked and loaded for the next bull run (IF and When it comes) till then HODL!! #BTC $BTC #ETH $ETH

2105 2018-11-14 21:04:42 The Fatherland Card is yesterday's news.

Now its all about that fake crypto-currency called Petro. 

To put it simple, it is a bond for future oil extractions, used as a fiat currency for daily transcations to ease the use of US dollars within the government.
2106 2018-11-14 21:04:29 Love the volatility of crypto market. Nice move. Expect the same in coming days but upwards only. Again, only those with solid project and mission will survive. All other coins will be gone.

2108 2018-11-14 21:04:17 in times like these people used to "normal" investing are like throwing hands up wondering what they can do. Crypto exchanges are instant, low trading fees and open 24/7. Crack that redbull and get scalping son. Sometimes you actually have to do work as a #crypto trader :P

2139 2018-11-14 21:01:47 Yeh, my friends were getting sick of me saying we had more downward pain to come, they were convinced we had bottomed. Nobody wants to hear what they don't want to hear.

You know why HODL is used right?

Hold On for Dear Life describes a very emotional grueling long term battle of grit, might, and intestinal fortitude. HODLing isn't for the week... so be strong. Hang in there and keep the faith!

Optimizing for value extraction via trading -> Path to fragility.

Optimizing for value creation via building tools to solve real problems -> Path to anti-fragility.

This culture’s health requires a higher capacity to resist low time-preference actors.

2219 2018-11-14 20:55:35 He's a true disciple, eat your words people of little faith, there is only one crypto with true utility XRP. Easy to crab when there's a bump in the road, sell your XRP and buy Shitcoin, whichever one is in vogue right now.God Bless DAI.
2220 2018-11-14 20:55:32 General uncertainty in the market is causing people to exit crypto.

2222 2018-11-14 20:55:28 Was thinking the same, only in crypto...
2223 2018-11-14 20:55:25 Maybe he missed a dot, 3.3k, and July next year ^^'
2224 2018-11-14 20:55:24 He ded by now
2225 2018-11-14 20:55:20 Always a possibility. That’s why you don’t invest what you can’t lose. But we’re long term crypto bulls, which is why we’re still here.

2232 2018-11-14 20:54:36 They knew they can't dump #bitcoin, so they started pumping TUSD/USDT instead.
2233 2018-11-14 20:54:30 Probably the last flushing out of crypto from all those weak hands, then (hopefully) the next bull run! If this is the precursor to the next bull run, I believe we are in for VERY exciting times - VERY exciting indeed!!!

2234 2018-11-14 20:54:21 Big surprise! You don't understand crypto or blockchain either. I can't help you. Sorry for your loss.
2235 2018-11-14 20:54:08 Nice way to twist my words. No. I said CinemaScore is out of date, multiple open forums for rating technology are superior & proven by crypto's value based on the same foundation. Pointed out that the other films had better audiences scores & that multiple sources reflect this.
2236 2018-11-14 20:54:07 You can blame today's selloff on the BCH fork.  That is what so many people are saying right now.  Craig wants to do a 51% attack on the BTC network and take it down.
2237 2018-11-14 20:54:03 God damn, I hope BTC continues the dump. Memes are getting stronger on crypto twitter.

2239 2018-11-14 20:53:53 Can you please say Bitcoin will never recover, so we can start a bull market again ?
2240 2018-11-14 20:53:53 Is this the last big dip before BAKKT launches and the crypto space starts to recover or are we in for a ride?

2244 2018-11-14 20:53:39 It actually investigates aspects of AI, machine learning, ethics and "pre-crime" in ways that you might not expect a TV show to, though there are like six million episodes a season so the gems are scattered thinly.
2245 2018-11-14 20:53:35 I love and support #XRP but I might have to buy some #OMG just in case now. @Coinbase loves #ERC20 tokens and #OMG fits the bill. Its my belief that some diversity in crypto portfolio is best.
2246 2018-11-14 20:53:27 Dare we say it?  The bottom is in? Again.... $KUBO $RPM holding steady.  $QUAN & $XBI now is your chance to BTFD.  $XRP - can I full time crypto yet?

2261 2018-11-14 20:52:28 @econoar @coindesk Having one giant centralized repository is an achilles heel of any crypto project. That's the irony of that metric.

2265 2018-11-14 20:51:50 Funny how I've always been sceptical of AI replacing lawyers but now I am on the receiving end of scepticism when I say that cryptoassets are law-proof. Which if true will end lawyers as mass flight to crypto makes adjudicative interpretation of facts and rules impractical.

2273 2018-11-14 20:51:13 They can have all they want, if people decide not to adopt something, it won't go anywhere. Crypto is still very small
2274 2018-11-14 20:51:12 Os fundamentais deixaram de fazer sentido há muito tempo no mundo crypto.
2275 2018-11-14 20:51:11 Where did I say nobody. I said Ripple won’t allow volume to go up quickly enough from their clients to get to 589 EOY. They will slowly increase volume. All current Xrapid partners have all confirmed they are doing a small percentage now and are slowly increasing volume.
2276 2018-11-14 20:51:11 IGT-CRYPTO is complex of platforms united in one resource, which is allowing to live in real world by using new currency. This is a unique opportunity to buy goods, to use different services by using cryptocurrency. #igt #igtcrypto #igt_crypto #blockchain #exchange #bitcoin

2286 2018-11-14 20:49:33 People like @ProfFaustus, @rogerkver literally show how crypto is controlled by a handful few too. After the next run, I am going all in on projects who actually admit they’re centralized, rather than this #decentralized #noCentralAuthority #PowerToThePeople bullshit 
2287 2018-11-14 20:49:27 400 to go and you are safe.
2288 2018-11-14 20:49:24 The most sensible tweet of the day!
2289 2018-11-14 20:49:23 It's a great project but there was always uncertainty about how success would translate into token appreciation. When the usage comes we'll know for sure. But it's likely the price will be underwhelming sadly

2299 2018-11-14 20:48:34 So @coinbase only looks after it’s rich investors allowingthem #xrp (coinbase custody requires $10M minimum). The average crypto investor is locked out from #xrp @coinbase - sounds anti crypto to me
2300 2018-11-14 20:48:34 Gotta buy a new one for work and one for crypto
2301 2018-11-14 20:48:28 In crypto 13 months still down 90% ...trying to survive..
 I put my  life saving of 3,000 in crypto now its  down to 300 ..and I'm still in the game.
2302 2018-11-14 20:48:28 This boils down to two philosophically opposing ideas fighting for the soul of crypto.  When you understand what those ideas are then the tweets make sense.
2303 2018-11-14 20:48:26 Looks like i might buy more crypto, might reach a bottom soon
2304 2018-11-14 20:48:24 75 years!

2356 2018-11-14 20:45:29 it looks great. but the main issue with crypto stats is that almost all of them are easily manipulated. for example, someone recently did some research that revealed a lot of xrp social activity was just bots, which likely applies to a lot of overall crypto activity.

IMO that time was 3-5yrs ago. He is no longer a high dollar big ticket player. He's an incredible business man but no NBA star.

2386 2018-11-14 20:43:52 Wrong. No one is using BCH for the same reason as most crypto. Everyone hopes it will increase in value so the can make (fiat) money. Dollar was immediate MOE as it represented the gold no one wanted to carry around.
2387 2018-11-14 20:43:46 Would love to do a livestream with some crypto company and give away like $75 on it by using @eth2io .  We could see how many people showed up. Any takers?  Could be a lot of fun.

2397 2018-11-14 20:43:04 I would highly advise 
@JihanWu @ProfFaustus @rogerkver you guys to stop this war right away. 
Every person you will meet at events or at an airport security cue for example are crypto holders. Ask yourself, what's gonna happen in the long grass? Dangerous game guys.
2398 2018-11-14 20:42:56 Wow never knew you been sabi crypto too boss..surest time to buy Is now
2399 2018-11-14 20:42:52 You can view crypto as a security as well. You are essentially a shareholder of a network, which its value changes based on network’s size and activity. We shouldn’t have labeled crypto as a currency from the start.

Ne kadar çok düşersek 2017 sonundaki 20k'nın köpüğünü almış oluruz ve çok daha yukarıları hedefleyebiliriz.

Mr. Antonopoulos,
We would love to have an interview with you for our new global media news site focusing on crypto-economics, NEWconomy.

We would love to hear your thoughts and have you as a regular expert to help our readers navigate this quickly-changing market.
2425 2018-11-14 20:41:34 That’s what new comers in crypto gonna say...how didn’t they see that coming...
2426 2018-11-14 20:41:28 I wonder if the manipulation that is happening right now is effecting the SEC’s decision on the upcoming ETF dates..
2427 2018-11-14 20:41:25 You did not just threaten to bring the entire crypto market to ruin over a petty squabble.

Get out of this market you absolute manchild.

2515 2018-11-14 20:34:58 FYI - I now offer PRIVATE MENTORING to people who are new to the crypto trading space or those who have been in it for a while but can't seem to stop losing money (in which case it also private counseling  ). DM me for the details.
2516 2018-11-14 20:34:48 Crypto just called to say, “Enjoy the play Mr. Lincoln.”

2527 2018-11-14 20:33:58 Damn fucking right. 

Enough “social justice” cry babies in this crypto realm. 

Being the true reasoners and forget the emotional pleaders for attention.

This should motivate us to build better Blockchain products and focus on its use cases than just creating crypto coins that doesn't have a value as such.

2563 2018-11-14 20:31:46 I am. The bank card colors look silly. Why not add a luxury design to it? And also make it possible to send crypto (xrp) to a different wallet?
2564 2018-11-14 20:31:28 Financial advisors who have allocated client money to #crypto (in a meaningful way, not just buying powerball tickets with spare change): what is the tone around this allocation in client interactions?

2587 2018-11-14 20:29:52 Yes, this is a V1 version of a project. No one has ever tried to succinctly visualize whole crypto asset networks before and we had dev limitations in the initial launch 

This is something we'll consider as it's very valid

2608 2018-11-14 20:28:25 Crypto is manipulated garbage, true story
2609 2018-11-14 20:28:23 Bitcoin is down over 13% today, and has lost about 70% of its value since December 2018. #crypto #bitcoin
2610 2018-11-14 20:28:15 Old support becomes new resistance.   Will be a few days before we can re test 5.8-6k.  imo
2611 2018-11-14 20:28:08 exit all crypto markets
2612 2018-11-14 20:28:07 #crypto is certainly taking part in #ReclamationDay

2618 2018-11-14 20:27:52 or we can see the market never recover and crypto is the biggest pump and dump/ponzi the world has ever seen
2619 2018-11-14 20:27:43 Eger bu gercek bir dip olsaydi, panik satislara ile beraber $5000 e dokunan bir wick gorurduk, ve altlar hizlica dipten geri yukseldiler. Dolayisi ile bu dusus tamamen manipulasyon, organik bir dip degil

2632 2018-11-14 20:26:41 Looks like a good time to sell all of your #Crypto
2633 2018-11-14 20:26:36 Or that there is a lot of morons.
2634 2018-11-14 20:26:26 You hear that ? No worries  @BouSalman
2635 2018-11-14 20:26:16 This will be a real test of the $6k line. Price has not dipped below $6k for more than 18 consecutive hours all year.
2636 2018-11-14 20:26:15 Are we crashing like 2015 or like we still good? Looks all amazing too me but crypto must be measured from your personal entry point and methods. Unless your a day trader hehe ummmm enjoy the carnage I know the "Kraken" will come for your BTC in prolonged bear trading times.
2637 2018-11-14 20:26:11 Just means more room on the upside.
2638 2018-11-14 20:26:10 @StellarOrg  is one of the best and serious crypto, i belive in all team.

2640 2018-11-14 20:26:04 please list #FabricTokenEcosystem its highly undervalued
2641 2018-11-14 20:26:03 I hope @rogerkver, @JihanWu & @ProfFaustus know that their idiocy is causing a ridiculous amount of damage to the crypto currency space with their petty in-fighting.
2642 2018-11-14 20:26:02 FYI:

passive income with Masternodes $DKPC
passive income with Exchange mining $APOT $BTMX
#masternodes
#passiveincome 
other suggestions?
2643 2018-11-14 20:25:29 When i teach people about crypto i tell them to buckle up because 10% a day is the norm, up or down doesn't matter.  These last few months have been weird
2644 2018-11-14 20:25:22 A total beatdown of crypto
2645 2018-11-14 20:25:17 Crypto market is not matured yet everything is over HYPE more correction on the way
2646 2018-11-14 20:25:12 Why is everyone freaking out lol
2647 2018-11-14 20:25:05 Back to the earth?
2648 2018-11-14 20:25:02 Ha! Welcome to Crypto, where manipulation is the name of the game.
2649 2018-11-14 20:24:57 That’s why I don’t surround myself with crypto twitter.

2652 2018-11-14 20:24:40 Using trader terms/charts/etc is so funny to me. Crypto is the EZ Bake Oven of financial trading
2653 2018-11-14 20:24:32 We have to hit 5200 for the true bottom to be in $BTC $ETH $XRP #Crypto #Crapto
2654 2018-11-14 20:24:32 
2655 2018-11-14 20:24:28 Pretty much, prob a bit worse on the volatility, except most of us have more money now so the numbers can be scary on the losses even though the % is not that different
2656 2018-11-14 20:24:19 Same scenario repeating last year. $bch was the main focus,  causing miners to abandon $btc mining, hence crashing the btc price in 2017. After that,  we went on one of the biggest bull run so far.
2657 2018-11-14 20:24:13 Read the thread of @galgitron and @XRPTrump I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.
2658 2018-11-14 20:24:01 Well iam selling my cars for btc if we go under 3k
2659 2018-11-14 20:24:00 Satoshi??? Da hell you do to the market...
2660 2018-11-14 20:23:53 You sell with a loss to the big guys and exit frustrated. In 3 years the big guys sell to your parents via banks and institutions packed as bonds. They lose their savings and exit frustrated. In 10 years you blame everyone except yourself. Think about it #BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin
2661 2018-11-14 20:23:50 Great perspective.  Thanks for sharing, people definitely need to hear that optimism during the current crypto downtrend thats currently underway!
2662 2018-11-14 20:23:37 Crypto just needs to become every day. Once grandma is using it - it’ll be here to stay
2663 2018-11-14 20:23:34 #Blockchain #Crypto Trading like the flash boys: Reading order flow
2664 2018-11-14 20:23:29 The ironic thing is that a lot of people I have met in crypto live a minimalist lifestlye. They don’t value wealth on the same level that most of society does. They’d be just find if $BTC went to beginning 2017 levels.
2665 2018-11-14 20:23:28 #CentralBanks are going to issue their own #Crypto. Regulators are going to set out rules. Those massive bureaucracies will just tangle themselves up....the builders in Crypto will keep our heads down and build a better version of money.
2666 2018-11-14 20:23:26 On 2015 yeah
2667 2018-11-14 20:23:23 plz crypto gods give me an entry
2668 2018-11-14 20:23:21 Just a reminder that watching all the poker player crypto experts over the last 2 years reminds me of children playing with toy trucks

2676 2018-11-14 20:22:52 Where am I using cmc?? Again. Why do you think Ripple is going to open up all that volume at once before EOY? Last time I’m going to ask.
2677 2018-11-14 20:22:50 Is it just me or is this guy the biggest tool in crypto??
2678 2018-11-14 20:22:42 More than that tho, with the fork, who knows what Coinbase will do with ABC vs SV. When BCH formed from BTC it took months to finally get your BCH
2679 2018-11-14 20:22:42 They fooled everyone so good,tether sneaked up in 4 days slowly to confuse everyone when market felled today,different prices on exchanges makes everyone confused
2680 2018-11-14 20:22:35 And, also, the only reason why some crypto have not been deemed securities is because they were thought to be decentralized. If a couple of bad actors can cause the price to crash, then that flies in the face of the intended interpretation of the ruling, at the very least for bch

2700 2018-11-14 20:20:41 Fernando, people like Craig Wright and Roger Ver are toxic to the crypto community. They are clearly and openly manipulating the market. Miners should stop mining BCH and let these guys talk to themselves for good. #BCHisFRAUD

2760 2018-11-14 20:16:26 go's ugly parts are usually deliberate tradeoffs in the language design that I actually think is one of go's strong suites, its language features are very orthogonal from each other, composing well, easy to learn. and the bad is usually easy to contain in a single lexical scope.
2761 2018-11-14 20:16:18 It can happen. Two big powerhouses going to fight for dominance. And the good thing is we reap the benefits of the battle

2771 2018-11-14 20:15:17 Look at the prices for BAT, ZRX, and ETC. They have lost all the gains they made from the pre-Coinbase "pump." This was before the price drop of all crypto today.
Coinbase has turned into a pump and dump scheme.
2772 2018-11-14 20:15:13 starting an online schism in the Armenian community by insisting Anna khachiyan is a "crypto-Turk"
2773 2018-11-14 20:15:10 just as it's easy to pick on go for stringly typed functions or for its relative verbosity, just as easy to pick on C++ for plethora of redundant language features, or any OO language for the composition vs. inheritance headache.

2783 2018-11-14 20:14:32 but it's easy to pick on any project, they all have warts, and it's easy to pick on any language, they all have warts too, in this case go *is* more verbose and does quite often make use of stringly typed functions because of design choices.
2784 2018-11-14 20:14:30 Very interesting project with smart concept. A mind blowing project for your investment. I believe that this project is worthy of your attention. #crypto #oppopenwifi

2787 2018-11-14 20:14:21 Most recent “how did I get here” moment: eating waffle chicken bites at a crypto brunch in Chicago. Never gets old!
2788 2018-11-14 20:14:15 i would say though that IMHO that both btcd and lnds' code bases don't make as good use of go as they could in terms of separating code into packages, with flatter packge dependencies, smaller files, and also make use of more shared global state than i would have liked.
2789 2018-11-14 20:14:04 there is literally not one crypto person of value who believes he is satoshi....
2790 2018-11-14 20:14:02 Intrinsic value of these currencies should be the value on electricity spent in minning these coins and that too is high as no-one asked them to create these...crypto is a fad which will pass leaving millions poorer.
2791 2018-11-14 20:13:59 sorry that was a shitpost, not meant to be taken seriously.

i've read a reasonable sample of both, personally i find btcd easier to read, but i'm biased since i am much more proficient in go, so i'm not sure how valid that is

2845 2018-11-14 20:09:48 Yes I agree that if you push 200 billion through Xrapid then you need a higher price.. but you are still avoiding my question. Why do you think Ripple will allow that all that volume to go on the ledger before EOY. Has not been their strategy and I don’t see them chance it now.

2850 2018-11-14 20:09:33 Maximalists and shitcoiners are both the NPCs of crypto. @Nouriel is mostly right. We need a new crypto wave

2858 2018-11-14 20:08:57 It would be very unlike CSW to talk a big game and then not be able to back it up

2860 2018-11-14 20:08:52 The Hash lords are going to battle tomorrow.  If Shark Pool is successful the demise of low cap pow coins is around the corner. CSW vs J WU, the crypto world at its core is about political philosophy that boils down to how much control is the individual willing to give others.

2865 2018-11-14 20:08:28 Good catch, that's insightful yo.
2866 2018-11-14 20:08:26 $CHX #Ownmarket are obviously not paying them for Twitter shills. But once anybody do his/her research, he/she will find out how much more further Own is in all aspects
2867 2018-11-14 20:08:22 So if I'm correct, US citizens cannot short crypto?
2868 2018-11-14 20:08:14 Fake it till you make it in action.
2869 2018-11-14 20:08:11 and crusty it is (tho getting better), Mr. Krabs would feel at home 

refactors are discouraged as there're sections of the code that almost NO ONE understands, sane thing to do is not touch code you don't understand
2870 2018-11-14 20:08:09 CRYPTO"S BTC a breakdown thru the $5400 levels opens up to the $3600 levels. Other Crypto's are Toast major breakdowns
2871 2018-11-14 20:08:08 So it's the equivalent of one overclocked 200$ GPU...for $800? People interested in crypto just aren't that stupid...right?
2872 2018-11-14 20:08:06 Thank you brother

I think most people who follow me whether they agreed with me or not remember me sticking to my $5800 call. I maintain that stance because thats what my TA was pointing to. Always trust your TA!
2876 2018-11-14 20:07:18 Developing a theory that twitter is actually responsible for the #bitcoin dip.

2883 2018-11-14 20:06:56 For those of you that are scared, or only new to crypto this year, please look at this time last year. We had two very specific periods of $2k+ losses in price before last year's bullrun. You have to have a massive move down, relatively quickly, to capitulate. That's how it works
2884 2018-11-14 20:06:45 The 2014 #crypto bear market dropped by ~$12billion vs the 2018 #crypto bear market which has dropped ~$640billion ... many more regular people will have lost money this year and that loss of trust will take time to repair #bitcoin
2885 2018-11-14 20:06:41 Aaaa

2887 2018-11-14 20:06:31 State backed crypto will never have scarcity and limited supply
2888 2018-11-14 20:06:31 I don't believe this is the 'real' drop.

If we would breach through $5,800, normally we see a panic wick towards $5,000.We didn't.

Some altcoins are bouncing really hard. $ONT +23%. $ETH +9% (in $BTC pairs) and so on ( $ADA, $NEO).

This move down = manipulation.

2921 2018-11-14 20:03:44 You shouldn’t equate utility with value. One is usefulness and another is regard. 

There will always be a boom and bust in a nascent technology.The idea of digital currencies or stores of value will outlast all of us.Our networks have just grown for them to be feasible recently.

2935 2018-11-14 20:02:23 Mining Bitcoin is expensive. Two people feuding over Bitcoin Cash can only destroy both of them. While the near term looks terrible and the long term effects of what is occurring will make crypto currency space undesirable to most. Bitcoin Cash isn’t BTC, ETH, or LTC.

3008 2018-11-14 19:57:11 Secular markets can last decades in equities (so years in crypto). But we are still in a secular bull market in crypto. Cyclical markets are short, years in equities and months in crypto.

3011 2018-11-14 19:56:53 And to all people who lost money in Crypto, don't give up!

- I lost more than 90% last year
- Learned FA, TA and made 15x back
- Cashed out and left 10%
- Then made 50x again
- Then got hacked and lost 70%
- Then made 2x again

And now this $BTC dump. Lol I don't give a damn.

3029 2018-11-14 19:56:00 I'm guessing it has so much technical debt because refactor prs are discouraged, which is good and bad. Good in the sense it's harder to introduce refactor bugs, bad in the sense it's doomed to be crusty.
3030 2018-11-14 19:55:59 Bitcoin will go as low as it has to shake even them.

3041 2018-11-14 19:55:28 The incompetence and/or the corruption of #crypto is devastating for the people that invest money they cannot afford to lose. A war is brewing and it isn’t the bitcoin cash printing press war, far more is at stake.

3059 2018-11-14 19:53:44 RT Nicholas_Merten: emkik101 I worked at a restaurant for two years washing dishes, I'm not making fun of their efforts. It's a meme tied to crypto being down due to a crypto having a higher attraction with a younger audience. Not everything is meant to be an insult.

3065 2018-11-14 19:53:24 Everyone is stunned about the $BTC price dropping. Those who have been in crypto long enough shrug their shoulders, later investors are in a panic.
3066 2018-11-14 19:53:21 we’re in a long term bear market in crypto. going to take years to turn around. every new bottom just brings more sideways action for months.

3070 2018-11-14 19:53:10 "Experts." Don't know how many times they told me, condescendingly, "you don't understand hashrate".  Just yesterday: "I’ll make sure to respond back to this thread once we begin pumping to prove to you i was right."

3080 2018-11-14 19:52:09 BTC'nin hareketinin hızına bağlı altların durumu. Onay haberi gelse ve tek kalemde 1000 dolarlık bir yükseliş mumu gelse altlar yine çöker, 1000 dolarlık düşüşte de bugün yaşadıklarımız oluyor. Ne kadar sakin sakin yükselirse o kadar rahat nefes alır altlar.

3094 2018-11-14 19:50:46 Interesting. CBs care about 1. financial integrity (~AML), 2. financial stability, and 3. monetary policy effectiveness.  If crypto gets big and less volatile, it will still worry CBs on all three.  (except maybe 1)  Hmm.  How to get crypto folded into public policy framework?

3146 2018-11-14 19:47:29 You guys need to stop asking him questions like he actually knows something. He hasn't made a right call in a decade. In 10 years gold will still exist (it won't be 5k an ounce), crypto will still be a thing and have adoption value, fiat will still exist
3147 2018-11-14 19:47:25 you think it's the primary reason for the dump today?
3148 2018-11-14 19:47:18 Just printed one on Kraken as well. Currently ranging in the 5.6k’s

3155 2018-11-14 19:47:02 I believe this has to do with the Bitcoin Cash drama going on.  Could be wrong.
3156 2018-11-14 19:46:59 Le marché des crypto-monnaies vient de connaître une secousse hors norme en raison des reventes et des changes bitcoin/bitcoincash en préparation au hard fork du bitcoin cash de demain.

3189 2018-11-14 19:45:24 Trolling? You need to learn the def of trolling. What you are doing is trolling like talking about my crypto holdings. What I’m doing is bringing up sensible points of debate on a public platform.
3190 2018-11-14 19:45:23 Hey so I haven't been on crypto twitter much for a few months now but $BTC really got rekt huh

I'm not fucking selling
3191 2018-11-14 19:45:23 Lol!! What an idiot . It's not all POW out there you know . So many projects in crypto close to their utility phase.
3192 2018-11-14 19:45:20 To clarify, most bull runs in crypto (& stocks) occur only after major selloff happens. I know many of you are scared, but you should realize things like this usually have to happen to result in a massive bounce back. This is the capitulation catalyst we need. Nothing more. #btc
3193 2018-11-14 19:45:15 You mean Crypto-cliff
3194 2018-11-14 19:45:15 Its about to either get really ugly, or really pretty with crypto. either way I'm not selling until I'm 25

3200 2018-11-14 19:44:54 I honestly have no idea what's causing this crypto dump. If I had to speculate or "develop a theory", it would be that insiders know of some regulations coming down. Hearing Tone cry about his bitmex acct makes me think the crypto casino for US residents may be coming to an end.

3226 2018-11-14 19:43:14 Yesterday I replied to a public post that I didn’t like the global economic markets having a downward effect on crypto. 

Today’s results, crashed

I think the best time to buy is when the bottom is confirmed and you buy near the bottom, instead of trying to predict the bottom.

Fair but consider that for 10 years an open system has kept billions secure, in time where everything gets hacked. Time and layer 2 is all that is required to realize programmable money.

3281 2018-11-14 19:39:55 Damn, Crypto is hurting right now lol
3282 2018-11-14 19:39:51 pamp it
3283 2018-11-14 19:39:44 I’m buying up big. About to soar
3284 2018-11-14 19:39:40 They call Straubel for "Strobel", and Musk for "Mask" lol. They use Franz' real name though. The whole crypto space is just one scam after the other.
3285 2018-11-14 19:39:38 We can discuss tomorrow my friend. See you at 10:00am
3286 2018-11-14 19:39:33 Thank you!
3287 2018-11-14 19:39:32 Your app sucks 
@binance most probably I will switch to another exchange now cause every time when some bad is happening in crypto space you guys just stop us from cutting our losses.
3288 2018-11-14 19:39:31 The bear is still alive. Just another day in crypto land 
3289 2018-11-14 19:39:27 Online gift cards to a specific spot I ask for, crypto currency or make a clip account on somewhere like manyvids or iwantclips (I don’t exactly remember the name but it’s something like that) and make them tribute the account.

3298 2018-11-14 19:38:52 Hahah ok you cant explain why they would activate them all at once?? History has shown they are very careful in increasing the volume on the ledger.
3299 2018-11-14 19:38:46 I love these quiet crypto days...all the experts go back into hiding...
3300 2018-11-14 19:38:45 Fun fact:

Majority of current traders hasn’t seen BTC this low while trading crypto

Should be scary
3301 2018-11-14 19:38:42 The best time to get into crypto this year was a year ago. The second best day is today until it’s tomorrow.
3302 2018-11-14 19:38:40 $ETH $130ish looks tasty. Will hold out for that and lower. Expected this drop a long, long time ago. It took a while to be comfortable being 100% out of crypto but it feels good now.
3303 2018-11-14 19:38:40 This isnt “Cryptoeconomics”, the name will garner confusion being “crypto-economics” - why not just Crypto-Asset Explorer?
3304 2018-11-14 19:38:37 is crypto currency dying?
3305 2018-11-14 19:38:37 Kullandiysan sevindim. Stop olduysa coinlerin
3306 2018-11-14 19:38:37 This is a good one
3307 2018-11-14 19:38:29 U lost nothing until u sell. So dont care about this shit, I ve got big balls. Huge balls. Crypto cant scare me.
3308 2018-11-14 19:38:25 Doesn’t it get removed as a product from #CME now its under $100bn...
3309 2018-11-14 19:38:20 Thank you for the nice feedback! Very happy with all the positive vibes!

3323 2018-11-14 19:37:40 do you feel the same for crypto hodlers?

3330 2018-11-14 19:37:10 I hope that's not his real name and people don't know where he lives because now he's playing with people's livelihoods and not even trying to hide it. In the crypto world that might just be "bad", but in the real world, it's worse than that......
3331 2018-11-14 19:37:07 ouch, I think you're speaking from purely familiarity there, many areas of bitcoind are just plain eye sores

give a brand new bitcoin programmer btcd, then bitcoind, I'd throw coins that the btcd fragment would be more easily grokable, even if they don't know Go tbh

3333 2018-11-14 19:37:00 BFX BTC 4H RSI is 9. It has been this low two other times in BFX history, going back to 2014. 
That is it. Twice. Aug 2015 and Jan 2016.
This isn't someone selling off supply. This is a killshot. Now, is this a fundamentals shifting exit all crypto move? Or is it just a spring.

3339 2018-11-14 19:36:24 I am % sure that I am not a #trader. But is it just me or does it look that the $3.72B volume on #BITMEX could have been multiple #OTC trades that went through the exchange?

3352 2018-11-14 19:35:30 Right, agree, when you are starting out, & if you got some budget, some paid articles can nudge you some investor attention.
Crypto startups don't listen. This advice is for adults only ;)
3353 2018-11-14 19:35:29 Apologize for repeating, the 30 day period (what you call wash sale), does not apply to crypto because it's considered property?

3358 2018-11-14 19:34:57 Consensus is an interesting concept. Technology has always trailed biology in sophistication and biology (RNA/DNA) has taught us that consensus is overrated. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. Although I'm struggling to put my finger on it.

3379 2018-11-14 19:33:11 Did a TA on @CryptoTutor followers count.

65.6k looks strong support.
70k-70.2k is a proven resistance zone.

I'll open a short around 70k-ish range & long around 65k-ish.

High risk trade. 
Do not use stop-loss

3380 2018-11-14 19:33:09 Out of all positions other than small caps and what's in cold storage. At some point I expect this to re-test 5.8k but there's very little sign of buying volume and Asia hasn't even really woken up yet.

3429 2018-11-14 19:30:37 One reason is.... crypto is overpriced... look at it. Eos is priced at the same level as easyJet (who actually have a product that more than 300 people a day use) and have assets (thousands of airplanes)
3430 2018-11-14 19:30:31 So you’re telling me the one time largest crypto exchange is saying that listing XRP is too difficult however every other exchange out there even the small ones don’t have a single problem listing it, it makes you question there capabilities

3432 2018-11-14 19:30:31 Closed Sell 0.1 Lots $EURUSD 1.1293 for -2.4 pips, total for today +34.8 pips $FOREX $USDX $FX $BTC #v4zzy #Bitcoin #Risk #Crypto
3433 2018-11-14 19:30:25 People are looking to top coins to dictate the market, but when you see absolute BS like what is happening with BCH, no wonder people loose trust.
3434 2018-11-14 19:30:25 ı liked platform exchange
3435 2018-11-14 19:30:24 The Crypto Industry in a nutshell: the earlier you got in, the smarter (and richer) you are.

3439 2018-11-14 19:30:11 Çılgınlık öncesi yükselen trendin alt bandı bende aynı fikirdeyim 
3440 2018-11-14 19:30:10  logic my friend. Ripple is not going to dump them all at once on the ledger. They will gradually build it up.
3441 2018-11-14 19:30:10 wow crypto is ded  jk

watsup my friends, Did you see that I already followed u, please! follow me back for crypto signals, thanks you 
3455 2018-11-14 19:29:14 It’s getting really mlm now. People will want crypto. You can move out of your parents basement. It’s a positive human endeavor. Like putting a man on the moon.
3456 2018-11-14 19:29:02 @rosonaon It is nice piece of work. It always great to see that new projects are emerging.  hopefully, I think this will help to expand crypto currency market.
3457 2018-11-14 19:29:00 you are not counting all the xrps that are locked away. ripple's supply is released, but used for strategic purposes to build the rails. and this "dumping" has not affected the price. But for sure, you shouldnt be investing in crypto if you are scared ar have no faith.
3458 2018-11-14 19:28:57 Wait, wait...let me ask again, you realllly think that this drop (we get many big drops, welcome to crypto) affects the bigger, overall picture? LOL!! Oh dear god, I'm so glad you replied again. This was good! Holy shit you have no grasp of short term and long term. 
3459 2018-11-14 19:28:55 @ProfFaustus You've got a doppelganger in Glasgow. Honestly thought it was you for a second on the train today until he spoke. Unless you're good at a Scottish accent...
3460 2018-11-14 19:28:47 I'm honestly just trying to make it through the site and can't get past the first video.  They say STRC aren't required to make progress, soooo why buy them?  I'm very confused.  Guess I'll deposit mine and see if it does anything.
3461 2018-11-14 19:28:38 @Coingarden_news 
Als xrp-er wil ik jullie attenderen op het volgende.
Ripple is een bedrijf en XRP is de cryptocurrency.
Btw goed initiatief om crypto currency bij een breder publiek onder de aandacht te brengen.

This is what crypto does to you 
3469 2018-11-14 19:27:41 Everyone like why is #Bitcoin dumping!!! 

Stop trying to understand and take advantage of the rare opportunity again!!! #Crypto
3470 2018-11-14 19:27:38 Was wondering where you went lol
3471 2018-11-14 19:27:27 There are very few crypto coins made to change the life like ldoge or Pandämonium pnd
Most are only for speculation especially bitcoin
3472 2018-11-14 19:27:07 Stay away from these guys, they steal from you on crypto/fiat exchanges.  You have been warned.
3473 2018-11-14 19:27:07 Chinese new year, or US Tax season or some crap about disruption. Maybe top it with something about the big investors coming into the market .
3474 2018-11-14 19:27:05 indeed
3475 2018-11-14 19:27:02 It’s the crypto equivalent of the French Revolution. They start off trying to overthrow the king, then they turn on each other.

3480 2018-11-14 19:26:41 Or they're chimpanzees who try catching falling knives and scream "alt season" in a bear market
3481 2018-11-14 19:26:40 Now that we got that out of the way, we can find the bottom. The start of the crypto bull market could be closer than you think.

3491 2018-11-14 19:25:51 Do you expect the absolute bottom to be reached soon in one downwave over the next 1-2 months. Or a bigger bounce between two downwaves until we reach 3.7-4k. This area is also my absolute bottom and I expect it to be reached in mid 2019. Means a bigger bounce from mid 4k
3492 2018-11-14 19:25:41 Good
3493 2018-11-14 19:25:41 Bitcoin’s market cap has dropped below $100bn and continues to fall - is the next resistance level $5,000 or less? I’d love your opinion if you have one!

3514 2018-11-14 19:24:24 This is final backpull of crypto loin before the big run to put fiat into dust...
3515 2018-11-14 19:24:22 There has been a massive crypto drop today. But there has been much worse capitulation in the market. In late 2013 litecoin rose to £29.91 & fell to £0.9. A 96% decrease that remained until March 2015
The market atm has fallen 89% & isn’t even a year on from the high of this year

3522 2018-11-14 19:23:47 Attempting to solve a crypto puzzle left over from a previous college. Work partner just says to me, "Can we just sent to @_llzes?"


3523 2018-11-14 19:23:40 LOLz best advice 2018 - thx mate
3524 2018-11-14 19:23:37 I’m sure you are working hard at a solution. Needless to say, this is all rather frustrating.
3525 2018-11-14 19:23:31 all tokens are good 
3526 2018-11-14 19:23:29 Can reveral happens very suddenly Mr birb?
3527 2018-11-14 19:23:28 Crypto Twitter is a funny place. On the way down, everyone is at each others throats, on the way up everyone is god's gift to trading and full of arrogance. At what point do we all just step back, put our differences aside, light up a fire and sing Kumbaya trading war stories?
3528 2018-11-14 19:23:26   Today sucks. Buuuuuuuut I'm in it for the long haul. Could be the-dump-before-the-pump, could be the last dip ever for all time. Keep your head high & your chin up  #crypto $BTC #cryptotwitter

3546 2018-11-14 19:22:27 Of course I'm aware - but the whales who bought and held $USDT to trade $crypto most likely did not buy at $0.97, they did at $1.00, and I'm sure they intend to redeem at $1. 

An overwhelming majority of $crypto / fiat liquidity is in that camp.
3547 2018-11-14 19:22:26 
3548 2018-11-14 19:22:21 I am openly problematizing crypto thought as much of 'head in the clouds + toy thinking' which gets too much social 'approval' from social media likes.. 

A mis-informed hermetic culture is a brewing.
3549 2018-11-14 19:22:15 Crypto with a crash today... ive been looking at buying lite coin for the past month... happy i didnt buy yet. Might be a good spot to buy at the low point today though
3550 2018-11-14 19:22:06 About 75-80% of my #crypto feed are talking about going long and knife catching. Not saying there won‘t be a bounce, just kinda thinking that won‘t be the case at the bottom. Not advice. #bitcoin

3565 2018-11-14 19:20:57 Hopefully I'll catch up to you OG guys one day but its hard trading part time. Today went well but would have been epic if I was full time trading.
3566 2018-11-14 19:20:56 Thats what I was thinking as well since all cashbacks are "often" considered rebates, just that with crypto-asset-class, this may be a grey area yet. Card rewards in some cases are but thats points-to-cash conversion/valuation. Appreciate the response! Thanks and Godspeed!
3567 2018-11-14 19:20:51 At the end of a solo I was 1 on 1, pulled my balloons out, found the guy, switched to rocket and launched at him, expecting to deploy glider and float away. Ended up falling to my death next to him
3568 2018-11-14 19:20:51 Lets wait and see. It can happen
3569 2018-11-14 19:20:23 Inderdaad, komt goed!
3570 2018-11-14 19:20:13 This should nearly cover the losses of today's crypto dip, right?
3571 2018-11-14 19:20:10 Now the wait and see ha

3573 2018-11-14 19:20:01 Yeeee my girl bought at 6.2k bc I told her it’s a good entry long term. She’s not amused right now 
3574 2018-11-14 19:19:58 Timing is just as important as being right.

If you think it's 2012 in crypto you're probably going bankrupt.

If you think it's 1972 in crypto, you're probably going to end up being one of the richest people in the world.

3593 2018-11-14 19:18:29 That level would completely damage trust in crypto for years.

3602 2018-11-14 19:18:04 Improving liquidity on crypto trading platforms is one way to encourage  mainstream adoption. To make it one of the priority solutions, we will  dedicate 10% share from profit generated from trading fee and put that  in a reserve liquidity pool.  #xera

literally the last time you can buy ... most likely because you'll be broke if shit dumps further

3615 2018-11-14 19:17:03 Most #BTC maximalists believe governments will be inclined to fight the spread of an independent hard money crypto that interferes with their money printing (a hidden tax on savings).  Please explain why you think this idea is incorrect.

3620 2018-11-14 19:16:29 Is there an economist (not crypto-) in the house for me to run something past? I've just quickly written a blog post on the IMF thing and I think it's correct, but I have the nagging feeling I've written something dumbly wrong about the real-world economy ...
3621 2018-11-14 19:16:19 Setting some ATL bids on $Alts just in case. They aren't dumping quite as hard as I thought they would.
3622 2018-11-14 19:16:18 Not nearly enough.
3623 2018-11-14 19:15:58 ...and once again I was proved right anyway. #crypto bulls getting battered again. They just won't listen to me.
3624 2018-11-14 19:15:58 おっと、monapartyもまだ持ってたか。これはCounterPartyを模造してモナコイン上で独自トークンのやり取りを行えるようにしたトークンだ。一瞬だけ加熱してその後はすっかり誰も使ってないな。燃やしたモナをそのまま売ったらいくらになったか考えるだけで頭が痛くなる…
3625 2018-11-14 19:15:53 Now @BFerguson01 doesn't even want to scam your crypto. Not worth the effort. I hear Hot Pockets are a delicious and great trading commodity though.
3626 2018-11-14 19:15:49 'Economy': a collaborative game where players compete to facilitate the global society to thrive. Scores are maintained in #crypto ledgers and represent every player's share to the global wealth.

3629 2018-11-14 19:15:37 2011, when that tweet had 1 like, your neighbour didn’t know what bitcoin was, talk at the bakery wasn’t about crypto, blockchain was somekind of jewelery and when  10000% profit could happen... people now laugh with 100%. When 95% wants to make fiat with it you get this. #wakeup
3630 2018-11-14 19:15:37 I don’t really trade, I buy when it is at a reasonable price and sometimes will sell a little and buy back lower. But mostly I’m a squirrel and I just buy low nuts and store away for the winter.

3653 2018-11-14 19:13:06 Limited supply is effectively a myth if the actual number of currencies is unlimited. So you have limited coins in each crypto, but there are apparently infinite cryptos.

3661 2018-11-14 19:12:11 $4.8k-$5.2k should be a better support
3662 2018-11-14 19:12:11 We are all the winners, if you still thinking is about sides, you missed about what crypto is, is not about a winner side, is when all of us, wins.
3663 2018-11-14 19:12:09 For real.  I wish I had the patience to sit around and short the drama.
3664 2018-11-14 19:12:06 This is the kinda stuff that makes me smile during all the red...Crypto Twitter is the funniest during crashes.

3673 2018-11-14 19:11:25 Yeah I’m just holding through the tough times and buying whenever it dips. I didn’t sell any. Probably not the most lucrative, but I’m more of a long term type of person.
3674 2018-11-14 19:11:20 Hahaha. You basically just tried to tell me centralization is how crypto works. That's clowning at its finest bro.

3707 2018-11-14 19:09:01 People see a sea of red in the crypto market. I see an opportunity to buy more, and proof that the bear will hibernate and the bull charge. I see it dip below $5000 before it rockets but who knows I could be wrong.
3708 2018-11-14 19:09:00 Trading crypto is about barking dogs. When they bark together, they all bark!

3740 2018-11-14 19:06:26 Just another dip. No need buying any more. 
 Unless it gets cut in half. Best to just swing trade to accumulate more. Any new money will just be paying for someone else’s exit from crypto.
3741 2018-11-14 19:06:17 For many weeks, people have complaining about the crypto market being so boring and flat.  Now that there is this sudden drop, people are panicking and realise they don't have all their ducks in a row.  Funny how humans are attracted to drama.  #drama #cryptocurrencies #bitcoin
3742 2018-11-14 19:06:12 check my DM, Sir
3743 2018-11-14 19:06:07 even with the dip in the crypto market, the @dentcoin Juggernaut will keep going !!! 
3744 2018-11-14 19:05:57 Way to sound like a homophobe just to try and make a point.
3745 2018-11-14 19:05:50 Actually that narrative is still plausible RN. Hash war
3746 2018-11-14 19:05:47 Is this the “1-click buy” patent of crypto?
3747 2018-11-14 19:05:43 Microsoft and Ubisoft currently have a royalties PoC. Smart contracts will definitely be the preferred payment method for royalties in the future.

3785 2018-11-14 19:02:54 Crypto is the most fun finance class for millennials.

In crypto, millennials willingly build knowledge about futures market, ETF, market growth, infrastructure, and startup ecosystem.

Better than any university course in the market...
3786 2018-11-14 19:02:50 Good

Blockchain has many uses that can make a real difference to people's lives. Let's just move on from the crypto currency con.

3805 2018-11-14 19:02:09 I have never bought or sold $BTC with fiat through an exchange.

I actually haven't put any of my own fiat into $crypto since 2015/2016. When I convert profits to fiat, I always sell OTC and receive cash.
3806 2018-11-14 19:02:07 I dont know what you mean, but i will say to you: within a small period you will have a ABN account incl crypto next to your Euro account! I am sure of it!
3807 2018-11-14 19:02:05 LOL so excited to see who between you guys will win the "shortest and useless dick in crypto" war.

3808 2018-11-14 19:02:03 Just curious, who on Earth is expected to support the SV monstrosity - especially after the massive damage its madman dictator  just inflicted on the entire crypto community?
3809 2018-11-14 19:02:01 What the feck has happened to my crypto? 
3810 2018-11-14 19:01:49 I honestly hope blockchain and the crypto-industry is stronger of these 3. All this is supposed to be a sort of revolution, isn't it?
3811 2018-11-14 19:01:46 @USAA  i would like to have @Ripple #xrp in my bank account please. can you make a section for crypto at your bank and also use #Xrapid so tranactions and settlesments and all that good stuff can go faster come on get with the program dont fall behind and become a 80's nintendo

3816 2018-11-14 19:01:20 Gotta be patient with crypto.  It is going to take years and years for this stuff to be smoothened and well operating.
3817 2018-11-14 19:01:17 If this were manipulation preceding institutional inflow, you wouldn't just sell the price down and buy it back up that would be zero sum. The point of selling would be to catalyze a bigger sell-off, i.e. below a strong support. Not saying it is.  I'm not buying or selling yet.
3818 2018-11-14 19:01:07 If you’re strictly relying on crypto funds to pay the bills, you are doing it all wrong. Sorry man, that’s how people get rekt’d.

3830 2018-11-14 19:00:13 Part of why $LINK is performing so well, despite no crypto euphoria, is that it works within the current system. While much of crypto is about upending the system entirely like a money populism, LINK works with the current financial system, just better. It's not a pipe dream.
3831 2018-11-14 19:00:09 When the market reacts like yesterday & today I feel like there are few individual traders holding and a lot of botz and pro traders dumping. 

Regardless my bet is two days of big red means big buy signal.

I'm curious if the recession coming on now will dump crypto further...

3837 2018-11-14 18:59:43 Today has been such a bad day for crypto. The markets have taken such a huge dip that I'm scared to look at what my portfolio rn.
3838 2018-11-14 18:59:43 @Craig show us your wallet.
3839 2018-11-14 18:59:21 How is that crypto-related?
3840 2018-11-14 18:59:17 Yeah I mean I pulled the trigger at $6k and more at $5.7k. I’ve got trigger fingers. But I’ll get more if it continues to drop etc. Does suck that it’s going down, but it is more exciting then sideways. We have been wanting some action for some time.
3841 2018-11-14 18:59:16 20 billion plus has just left the crypto market in less than 12 hours!  The whole manipulated market looks pretty quick....

3868 2018-11-14 18:56:40 We can protest many things with our words and marching and meming. The use of crypto is a much more tangible form of resistance. "I don't like your policy. I don't like your money. I am moving on."

3892 2018-11-14 18:54:45 Waiting for the business news article trying to tie this entire crypto market bloodbath to a single news event which has nothing to do with it.

"Crypto markets plummet after Trump tweets to French President"

"Altcoins reach new lows upon tragic news of Stan Lee's passing"
3893 2018-11-14 18:54:43 Feel free. Not worth buying until it gets cut in half. No need paying for someone else’s exit out of crypto
3894 2018-11-14 18:54:41 Market value of crypto must trace back to the point when crypto was not a medium of exchange. Pre-medium of exchange value would sit where mc=mp. With a lot of assumptions, one can claim a crypto is as valuable as the cost of electricity and computing power needed to produce it

3898 2018-11-14 18:54:20 That's skin in the game that you feel. It's also what keeps evolving our skills. I will probably hold some crypto until judgement day.

3901 2018-11-14 18:54:15 I believe that crypto adoption is an active form of resistance and a measure of the shifting paradigm.

3906 2018-11-14 18:53:52 This dip is pretty similar to last years just before the 2017 bull run. Is this the start of a 2018 bullrun?

3998 2018-11-14 18:47:51 Probably by the end of the month. When bitcoin recovers after it's done doing this capitulation, the uncertainty around where the crypto bottom is should be gone, and then we can finally go up for real.

4040 2018-11-14 18:44:42 I'm a firm believer that there won't be just one crypto to rule them all. If there was would that not just be more centralized nonsense? I think with chain swaps and interoperability btw networks there is a good chance that lighter cryptos could be mined...
4041 2018-11-14 18:44:26 but i did tho 
4042 2018-11-14 18:44:23 No Kenia e Uganda particularmente ganham cada vez mais espaço mainstream. Diria que as crypto hoje nesses países sao como o mobilemoney a 10 anos atrás, da para perceber que serão parte importante do futuro do dinheiro

4055 2018-11-14 18:43:36 Good @mappopk_crypto
4056 2018-11-14 18:43:34 Might some part - or most? - of that amount be what’s washing through from fiat->crypto->fiat as part of a big money laundering operation (hard stare at Bitfinex)?
4057 2018-11-14 18:43:31 Keep thoose informative comments comming 
4058 2018-11-14 18:43:23 We're not intending to fearmonger at all. Our questions are valid - we have concerns about centralization (also Stellar, btw) and we don't accept Ripple's declaration of independence from XRP as Gospel truth. That's all. Otherwise, they're doing great!
4059 2018-11-14 18:43:23 @Crypto_Talk1 Cheers for the follow. I'm looking forward to reading your tweets. I hope your Wednesday is a good one!
4060 2018-11-14 18:43:14 When and how can XRP decouple from Bitcoin? One should have nothing to do with the other. When Apple stock prices tumble, McDonald's stock is not affected. Why must crypto be subjected to this? Something must be done! The madness must stop! @JoelKatz #xrp @LeeR91
4061 2018-11-14 18:43:08 Buy the dip - no matter how large
4062 2018-11-14 18:43:04 크게 변화는 없는데 조금 붙긴한것 같습니다.
그래도 SV가 워낙 압도하니 지켜보자구요.

4069 2018-11-14 18:42:38 #XRPthestandard It is clearly as day light that @crypto_briefing is anti $XRP community by spreading FUDs.
4070 2018-11-14 18:42:32 Great buying opportunity.  Might add to my bags a little bit.
4071 2018-11-14 18:42:28 
4072 2018-11-14 18:42:22 Great stuff keep it up
4073 2018-11-14 18:42:21 2014 was worse because no one was sure if crypto would survive. I don’t think that’s really an issue now. That said we could be in for an extended bear market like 2014 if $5800 really breaks down.
4074 2018-11-14 18:42:21 I personally invested during the wildest BTC bullrun a year ago in November. My last BTC purchase took place when it was around 16,000$. So I know what HODL means, I've been doing that since January... As long as you don't invest more than you can lose, you're fine. Patience...

4096 2018-11-14 18:41:16 We could do that. Malware comes after their first crypto course. I've got a couple samples that might work for that :)
4097 2018-11-14 18:41:06 Crypto is into me, so I am just me.
4098 2018-11-14 18:41:06 How can we all claim $BTC to be the liberating decentralised currency when a few guys control the majority mining, and can dictate a crash as and when they see fit. #disillusioned #crypto

4101 2018-11-14 18:41:01 out of curisoity - isnt the coinbase phenoma over? it seems all the coins that listed on CB are worst off after CB listed them - in value at least.
4102 2018-11-14 18:40:56 Good good luck
4103 2018-11-14 18:40:55 Why in the hell would you store crypto in a bank? These people are hopeless
4104 2018-11-14 18:40:48 Off to do some mundane stuff for a while...pay bills, balance checkbook. Then back to crypto stuff. TTYS. Stay Safe.

4111 2018-11-14 18:40:43 This is not crypto capitulation yet.  We would have to get significantly below $180B market cap.

4115 2018-11-14 18:40:09 You obviously have never had major depressive disorder. It's a self fulfilling cycle and it was the only thing that helped me break out of that.
4116 2018-11-14 18:40:09 As long as I stop buying lol. Having a difficult time finding the balance between investing and trading and between work and life. Pretty sure I still have nothing to worry about as long as I lie low for a while.
4117 2018-11-14 18:40:09 5% down here. Not bad. Also, i am used to pain and starting to like it.
4118 2018-11-14 18:40:06 Nice 7 pages of buy orders got filled for me last night, mostly the upcoming Coinbase coins. Nice (:
4119 2018-11-14 18:40:06 Yeah. Smart money knows and they are investors not traders, which is why no one is selling.

4136 2018-11-14 18:38:45 Binance was down, $bch people are fucking with $btc, cboe futures expiry... Easy to latch onto events as causes for this dump but fact is no one gives a shit about crypto right now and we've probably got months if not years more of churn before new money takes notice again
4137 2018-11-14 18:38:45 So, in the long-term, the sooner this happens, the better IMO. It's sort of like Central Banks shooting themselves in the foot. 

Either way way I believe majority of global transaction will be crypto, but time-scale is the big question. This just speeds that up IMO.
4138 2018-11-14 18:38:44 I don't think so... more blood will be spilled...

Satmışlarsa o aralıkta satmış bu da bir zayıflığa sebep olmuş olabilir. Diğer bir durum Bitmain bugüne kadar sessizdi eğer atılan fotoğraf sahte değilse elindeki BTC hashini+
4142 2018-11-14 18:38:12 This happened in August.....hope we bounce...
4143 2018-11-14 18:38:11 Funny how EOS gets criticized for having too many whales controlling all the supply & voting power. But at least EOS whales won't cause EOS and 1000 other cryptocurrencies to all crash as well.
4144 2018-11-14 18:38:11 Thanks for the information, will review it carefully.
4145 2018-11-14 18:38:10 There has been efforts to correct misperception  & is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  There is 0 official ruling from the SEC (except some employer who said it so) that $ETH is not a security.  $XRP has been around long enough & SEC still has not touched $XRP. FUD < TRUTH
4146 2018-11-14 18:38:09 Rage quitting crypto
4147 2018-11-14 18:38:03 Wheel out of crypto into natty gas?

4149 2018-11-14 18:37:54 Is this the part where crypto experts come out of hiding and say “see i told you so! We going down like i said 5 decades ago!
4150 2018-11-14 18:37:53 WOW good
4151 2018-11-14 18:37:52 Hope everyone is doing okay. The good news is, we will be losing a lot of the $Crypto 'experts' after this.

4159 2018-11-14 18:37:07 Can't wait to buy those coins that people will sell to harvest those losses but the problem is that from today till the end of the year is a long time in #crypto.

4167 2018-11-14 18:36:30 still-overcollateralized-but-below-margin loan is high, then those authorized to liquidate (which may be some special party, or may be open to arbitrary third parties) have a strong incentive to monitor for breaches and liquidated (which in crypto just means setting up a server).
4168 2018-11-14 18:36:19 Unfortunately there's no time for patience in crypto, it's kill or be killed and alot of bodies are piling up.
4169 2018-11-14 18:36:18 Thanks  
4170 2018-11-14 18:36:03 Of course it is @nathanielpopper wrote it !
4171 2018-11-14 18:35:57 But still comments on tokens owed to customers from forks?
4172 2018-11-14 18:35:48 Reminds me of the Soros quote, “I’m only rich because I know when I’m wrong…I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes.” I wholeheartedly agree and LINK's PA on this BTC dump tells me the market is finally starting to see what it is. May even be a new trendline.
4173 2018-11-14 18:35:24 Scale transaction fees below 2 dollars. Especially since bitcoin is transacted in fractional amounts(satoshis). Eth allows transactions less than .09 USD. Majoritity of tokens are ERC-20 tokens.
4174 2018-11-14 18:35:21 Congrats!! I actually recently reshorted ETH. Down we go :)
4175 2018-11-14 18:35:16 ciekawe

4177 2018-11-14 18:35:15 It's not about being bulltards, it about understanding where you are in the cycle. Clearly you just learned about crypto a few months ago. Calling us dumb & broke makes you look like a chump.
4178 2018-11-14 18:35:14 Correct... we all learned from last year

4182 2018-11-14 18:34:52 @binance having trouble placing sells. Sells are not going through and moving to the buy section. Can cancel because it says order already placed.
4183 2018-11-14 18:34:44 great team guys
4184 2018-11-14 18:34:43 The deep integration of the banking system is sort of the most defensible aspect for fiat. Eliminating that friction for people would truly put fiat into direct competition with #crypto.

Then I think it becomes inevitable that people move towards sounder money, likely #Bitcoin.
4185 2018-11-14 18:34:42 calling it now, the low for BTC is $750 by early 2020
4186 2018-11-14 18:34:39

4190 2018-11-14 18:34:21 That is the real risk to any longer term investor. All this noise and short time frame trades are the different between a mega yacht and simply a solid yacht. Crypto succeeding is the difference between bust and a yacht.

No, this is totally different at the macro level. Crypto becoming a mainstream idea has succeeded and now adoption feels pretty inevitable, just tough to guess how long.
Kind of similar market setup tho - we still haven't hit despair yet.

4340 2018-11-14 18:21:30 Exactly, pattern so obvious then why now 
4341 2018-11-14 18:21:25 It's hard to predict what exactly will happen in this scenario, but we surely will notify our community. So stay tuned for updates.
4342 2018-11-14 18:21:24 IMO late Dec-Feb was Bitcoin bear. Feb-now was a neutral market. If we legit trade in 5500 and below then it is another bear. IMO crypto volatility is so high that market cycles are compressed. 9 months (Feb-now) w/o a real push south is equivalent to years in equities
4343 2018-11-14 18:21:21 Using the word crypto and investment in the same sentence... 
4344 2018-11-14 18:21:19 So... Tones forecast was pretty accurate.... @ToneVays
4345 2018-11-14 18:21:11 Is anyone seriously surprised an almost year-long textbook descending triangle finally reached apex? It's been a pressure cooker since the summer. $btc $crypto

4349 2018-11-14 18:21:04 Just because someone is in the #crypto space doesn't exempt them from being as dumb, gullible and as easily manipulated as the rest of humanity.
4350 2018-11-14 18:21:02 Wooaahh and dayyuuummm #bitcoin!  

I knew we would see $5k before $10k. I honestly believe we’re getting close to the bottom.   Black Friday came in early. 
Final weak hand rinse! 

Do not panic and sell!
#BTC will roar back!
4351 2018-11-14 18:20:59  Beak does not take kindly to shoddy journalism.
4352 2018-11-14 18:20:59 I find you very depressing because CBDCs could actually complement crypto-currencies and everyone would be better off. But no, you're just backward and see everything as a zero-sum game.

4360 2018-11-14 18:20:17 Cool
4361 2018-11-14 18:20:14 If you got good ones, i hope Austria dont need the "always 10 years to catch up to Germany" time :-D
4362 2018-11-14 18:20:13 But that doesn't mean they are similar risks. 

1. Stable-cryptocoin: best 
2. Stable-surveil-coin: has risks you just identified
3. Unstable-crypto-coin: has collateral risk unlike stablecoin
4. Unstable-surveil-coin: bad.

Shouldn't conflate 1-3 just bc 1 doesn't exist yet
4363 2018-11-14 18:20:13 #Crypto wreckage this morning. Stopped out of all trades last night and bought most back at 10-15% discount this morning. Anyone else out there crazy enough to buy the dip? 
4364 2018-11-14 18:20:12 Lmao ... That's pretty numb . 
4365 2018-11-14 18:20:09 I just thought the same today. What if the whole BCH bullshit is staged just to have a reason for breaking the market down. „Decentralized“ 
4366 2018-11-14 18:20:09 "......."

So whales dumping? I think my crypto days are over..

4379 2018-11-14 18:19:26 I think we have a dead cat bounce coming! By the time the dust settles a lot of ppl in crypto will be bitter and exit with a huge loss... that’s the bottom I’m going to add to my stack at that point.
4380 2018-11-14 18:19:19 Orders not cancelling on @binance @cz_binance What's up?

4404 2018-11-14 18:17:39 Have a functional model of a crypto-stablecoin where the fiat backing isn't subject to backdoor control by the fiat issuer (this idea - anonymous fiat cash wallets not controlled by central issuer-is a big part of my dissertation fwiw, I view it as a first order social priority)
4405 2018-11-14 18:17:38 SCREW PAYPAL and their useless money system- where’s BitChutes crypto wallet? I’ll gladly start paying a subscription in any blockchain denomination they offer. Silicon Tyrants deserve to starve.
4406 2018-11-14 18:17:31 I see traders try to buy the dip on some $alts expecting $BTC price quick rebounce. It can work out well but seems too risky now.
4407 2018-11-14 18:17:31 such exciting times for crypto and BTC,finally some moves,lets go and accumulate or be prepared 4 it at least
4408 2018-11-14 18:17:17 Nice! Good adds

The market experienced the same in February
4415 2018-11-14 18:16:46 That is where I am. In 3-5 years I'll either have made a shit ton of money, or lost it all. What has happened today (and for the last 8 months) is all noise in the grand scheme of things. Crypto/bitcoin will either make it, or it wont

4520 2018-11-14 18:11:10 In fact, @nChainGlobal is opposed to patents in the base protocol which is yet another reason why they do not want additions to it that could contain patented ideas.  Keep the patents out of the base layer and use them as defense for apps on top.

4557 2018-11-14 18:08:52 It's a choice that is forced on people. You cant get a 'real job' unless you go to college. I agree with you that it's not the truth but that is what the economy is built on. Go to school then get a job then buy a house and a car. All the while digging yourself deeper into debt.

4564 2018-11-14 18:08:33 It increases the risk of the entire crypto space, plus hash power can be diverted. IMHO the dump probably started due to $BCH and then it became a herd trade for retail which pushed it further down.
4565 2018-11-14 18:08:31 Well, if there was a way to have one global currency, crypto would be a way to do just that.

4568 2018-11-14 18:08:21 i think the right way to think about this is they have very different risk profiles. the price of an audited, credible backing in fiat has, so far, been issuers building in blacklists by which they can freeze accounts. crypto-backed stablecoins need not include this. so,

4676 2018-11-14 18:01:27 just curious. there’s probably always one gap below to fill? or they were all filled during the bull run?
4677 2018-11-14 18:01:26 Henry, is a gift card at Target or a voucher for movie tickets at a theatre worth only "what someone else will pay for them"? If no, then your statement is not true for all crypto coins.

4731 2018-11-14 17:58:17 There's only one secure and usable way to store crypto assets, with a hardware wallet. The rule of thumb is to get one before your holdings are worth more than your monthly salary.

As exchanges step up their game, so will the hackers, the lowest hanging fruit = software wallets.
4732 2018-11-14 17:58:09 There are no patents in the Bitcoin protocol and there never will be.  It is all prior art and un-patentable.  

Any app can be built on top.  Go for it.

Patents are for defense.

4734 2018-11-14 17:58:01 Just like countries, most crypto coins won't disintegrate due to external forces (i.e trolls in crypto), but rather from within due to disagreeing factions. External opposition tends to strengthen unity within a group

4740 2018-11-14 17:57:37 Moved final btc to cash first thing this morning (uk time). Ada short from last night and eos short from this morning. Lucky I guess.
4741 2018-11-14 17:57:35 Yep totally agree, that's why you shouldn't leave your crypto in a exchange..

Remember! 

If it freezes going down, what do you think will happen when it shoots up??
4742 2018-11-14 17:57:35 Crypto has eliminated all my emotion.   I feel nothing.   Had some low bids that had been sitting get filled.  Wasn’t expecting every one to hit at once though 
4743 2018-11-14 17:57:28 I dont want to throw my reputation out of the window but it could be quite possible that this dump, with no real correlating news, could be caused by the 'crypto mafia'. Big people scamming others. Just a sell for them. They dont care.
4744 2018-11-14 17:57:27 Yes because of the  current drop we have 10-15% less if you calculate in dollar, but the positive is that we still have the same amount of Bitcoin and other crypto . Relax and look at it with a longterm view. #bitcoin #cryptolife #Blockchain #cryptocurrencies #cryptonews

4755 2018-11-14 17:57:01 That was because of bitcoin cash “flippening” BS. This is because of literally nothing which is a terrible sign.

4763 2018-11-14 17:56:16 Hey Alexa,
Can crypto go negative?
4764 2018-11-14 17:56:14 The influencers that haven’t been preaching to create & follow a plan should have no voice when the market sells off like this. They are fair weather fans & should not be trusted. Focus on those that keep you accountable and remind you of what’s important in times like these.
4765 2018-11-14 17:56:11 You still see tons of crypto investors on the TL hyping up different names or commodities plays.

Most have no edge and often don’t understand portfolio construction or risk management given how much concentration has dominated crypto returns.

4795 2018-11-14 17:55:01 I want to clarify what "Filling the gap" means. This does not mean that we are turning around. Its simply means that there was an unresolved gap in the price action that can now be put to rest. There is another however at $4800 dollar range. I will try to find it and post it.
4796 2018-11-14 17:54:56 Where is crypto wild west? Somebody check in on him

4830 2018-11-14 17:53:31 The problem is peter that you are measuring its success by the current financial instruments (fiat valuation) That is what makes it correlated asset. Crypto shouldn’t be looked at as the the recipe for success today, it’s a hedge against the failure of tomorrow.

4843 2018-11-14 17:52:52 Arbitrage, (the French seem to have a lot of great words) trading the same crypto from one exchange to another for profit. Arbitragers help steady the market prices between exchanges. Times like this can be the perfect storm for profitable arbitrage.

4930 2018-11-14 17:47:22 The big problem with institutional players and traders getting into crypto is they will sell to cover their asses in the fiat markets  

So a bloodbath in fiat will knock-on into crypto - as is happening right  now.  

Before we were separate - now we are linked - good or not?
4931 2018-11-14 17:47:21 Be safe if you’re buying this dip, a death cross is forming on 3-days chart letting us know that it could go even lower during the next weeks or months.



Last time it crossed was in 2014.

We’re well under 200 and 50 EMA and still in a death cross on 1-day chart.

4944 2018-11-14 17:46:59 Good news
4945 2018-11-14 17:46:51 When you register, the game automatically creates an ethereum wallet for you... So once you buy the BRN it is automatically stored in that wallet. Good thing is that you also have the private keys to your wallet too
4946 2018-11-14 17:46:43 time to buy #crypto
4947 2018-11-14 17:46:40 Yes I am, but crypto is non my whole life, it's just part of my life.

4953 2018-11-14 17:46:11 Isn't daily close a pretty arbitrary concept for an asset traded 24/7?
4954 2018-11-14 17:46:04 "Never invest more than you can afford to lose"....Tell me ONE freakin true-blooded #Crypto "Investor" who follows this, and, I'll show you a white blue whale.
4955 2018-11-14 17:46:02 Historically every Fiat currecncy in history has gravitated towards you guessed it zero. Not just crypto.
4956 2018-11-14 17:46:01 Easy, you click the link to get started.  All you need is little crypto to get started.  #cryptocurrency #crypto #recycle #growth
4957 2018-11-14 17:46:00 それはCounterPartyだな。最近だとあんまり見かけない珍しいトークンだが、独自のトークンをビットコインの通貨に乗せて作れる便利なトークンだ。一個試しに作ってみるか？今だとだいたい700円くらいで発行できるぞ。俺も昔20個くらい作って友達に配ってたっけな…もう昔のことだ。
4958 2018-11-14 17:45:58 Crypto is still a 100% speculative market at a measly $200 bil "market cap". This is Goldman Sachs and their kin, once again, market manipulation, shaking down the weak hands so they can rob the casino. Who cares if it's down a nickel, 50 cents to 45 cents don't mean nothin'.
4959 2018-11-14 17:45:39 great work

4961 2018-11-14 17:45:23 @CryptoMichNL lol
4962 2018-11-14 17:45:18 Very unpopular opinion: for crypto to succeed, #Bitcoin ultimately needs to die (or become irrelevant)
4963 2018-11-14 17:45:17 If there’s one thing I’ve learned from crypto twitter it’s that predictions don’t mean shit bc things change too quick in a market like this. It is funny when the big dogs try to cover it up tho
4964 2018-11-14 17:45:12 Crypto callapso!

Past caring. I'll probably check back in 2021 and be very rich, until then I'm holding, come what may.

4974 2018-11-14 17:45:04 With a market cap as small as crypto, the whole market could be easily manipulated I’d say. Best to let the whales shake everyone out and wait for solid indicators before my buy ins start up again. Though I’m nobody, so who knows.

4986 2018-11-14 17:44:28 Idk, but you can see who took a big loss v/s who was not in any position v/s who shorted! Those who are silence are probably mourning about their losses
4987 2018-11-14 17:44:27 @binance Wah Wah Crypto plummeting and all my orders are frozen?!?! How can I buy the dip when it don't work???

His charting strategy does NOT mess around. The man knows wtf he's doing
4992 2018-11-14 17:44:13 We re going to 4800
4993 2018-11-14 17:44:09 It's clear at this point the problem with the market is that it's dependent on slowest coin with the worst tech. To get a true sustainable bull run, someone will have to replace BTC as the market leader. Whether it's EOS or another cryptocurrency.
4994 2018-11-14 17:44:06 Gotta tweet lots about crypto so you can get more twitter followers to sell to

5041 2018-11-14 17:42:05 Of course bugs should be removed as it is the original idea and incentives that are fundamental and should be secured.

ANYONE can build on top of that and nChain has said that you are free to use any of their IP for BCH tools (which protects us all in the future.)

5045 2018-11-14 17:41:51 Unfortunately, too many younger crypto investors are perma-bulls with boundless optimism, especially when it comes to technology names.
5046 2018-11-14 17:41:46 At this point I’m giving up on crypto gonna stop caring. Shit is fucking up my moods on the daily now. Uninstalling all the price stat apps

5048 2018-11-14 17:41:34 Mark my words !! If 5800 holds then this will the last dip of the year

5071 2018-11-14 17:39:50 So BG123 predicted 589$+. So possible 589$ - 5889$, otherwise it would had another 0. My thoughts are going to this: We will see an complete and gnashing change of value between the top crypto assets till the end of the year, they will be determined by their utility as Brad said.

5090 2018-11-14 17:39:12 The protocol changed and had additions with Satoshi still there, should we erase them and bring old bugs back or what
5091 2018-11-14 17:39:09 That's good. My chart predictor for the next year said buy under $5980, sell above $12K. When difficulty increases prices should too next year.
5092 2018-11-14 17:39:07 I’ll do it! But who’s going to like it?
5093 2018-11-14 17:39:06 Thankfully Binance has the dust option to clean up all my crypto.
5094 2018-11-14 17:39:05 I learn a lot from you too mate!
One of the best content on CT! 
Cheers! 
5095 2018-11-14 17:39:05 I am using mercatox too! That's a good choice!

5098 2018-11-14 17:39:00 Totally agree
5099 2018-11-14 17:38:58 nice
5100 2018-11-14 17:38:57 People said similar things about ipo’s. I didn’t buy eth in the beginning because I thought,surely the market isn’t that stupid. Now, I’m past underestimating crypto crowd intelligence. I’ll ride anything that pumps, and right now people seem to be waiting for an sto platform

5117 2018-11-14 17:38:10 Perfect
5118 2018-11-14 17:38:08 So, does all the new/dumb money rush back into crypto before or after their homes get foreclosed, their 401ks are wiped out, and cutbacks and redundancies force them into FEMA camps...? 

Not sure you can trade foodstamps on any existing exchanges but, hey, maybe that's an idea?!
5119 2018-11-14 17:38:07 Also going back to yesterday and BCH, this move could be the most brilliant move I’ve ever have yet to see in crypto. Period. If you pay attention to the market as a whole, you know what I mean. That question should be answered by November 17th.
5120 2018-11-14 17:38:06 @mappopk_crypto fine
5121 2018-11-14 17:38:06 Sort it out @binance I can't place any orders while Crypto is on the dip. Winding me up.
5122 2018-11-14 17:38:01 Pivotal advice right here.  Thank you
5123 2018-11-14 17:38:00 @binance @cz_binance #binance is #fucked right now. nothing loading, won't let me create orders. what's going on, I thought this was the #besteexchange in #crypto?
5124 2018-11-14 17:37:59 early CT was like a few hundred people knew anything about crypto and everyone else followed them.
5125 2018-11-14 17:37:58 Bah j'espère pas que tu les auras, sinon ce n'est pas bon pour moi 
5126 2018-11-14 17:37:57 @mappopk_crypto amazing
5127 2018-11-14 17:37:57 Hi, sorry for the trouble! We knew this problem and we are working on it now, your patience would be much appreciated.
5128 2018-11-14 17:37:56 Call the bullpen... Hope there's no extra inning after the 9th...
5129 2018-11-14 17:37:49 It is a great tool but I never ever use it on its own, remember it is just a measure of momentum. Price Action will trump all. Use indicators cautiously

5136 2018-11-14 17:37:24 #Bitcoin under 6k is scary. Bears have been asking for this, let's see where they takes us. My guess is the bear market got a lot longer. In the end, we still don't have the volume we need, this move is only going to make it worse. #blockchain #crypto #cryptocurrency $BTC $ETH
5137 2018-11-14 17:37:24 Wow, the crypto market has just taken a huge nose dive in the last few hours.
5138 2018-11-14 17:37:23 We both were bearish about $BTC will hit below $5800 when $BTC was around $6500s.
5139 2018-11-14 17:37:12 Hi, sorry for the trouble! We knew this problem and we are working on it now, your patience would be much appreciated.

A little light Kraftwerk, some Underworld, not sure how minimalist you're looking to go but some Satoshi (Tomiie, this time) might be nice for a dark beat. Good luck :)
5165 2018-11-14 17:35:54 Can someone tell Bitcoin its pumping in the wrong direction !!!! Wtf

5171 2018-11-14 17:35:29 Major respect for the materials you have been producing  Heres a question that has been baffling me for a long time - is there a reason to why the RSI indicator is almost never reliable during big moves?
5172 2018-11-14 17:35:18 same

5175 2018-11-14 17:35:04 anyone else actually read the patent linked in that article? It is the exact procedure (‘system’) of how a standard bitcoin or crypto wallet is algorithmically coded under the hood... I would love to hear some thoughts and speculation after realizing that.
5176 2018-11-14 17:35:03 In 10 hours, #Crypto lost about 30 BILLION in market cap.

You were right all along

5181 2018-11-14 17:34:53 Ya now what though
5182 2018-11-14 17:34:52 Your methods have been questioned a lot. BUT - More often than not your accuracy is something masterful. Gotta respect that. Well done!

5190 2018-11-14 17:34:19 Before you talk big to people on Twitter just remember that you don't know who they really are or what they're really capable of. The passionate tech guy you disagree w/ online and call a fgt kid may be fully capable of slapping you about irl. Keep that in mind at #crypto events.
5191 2018-11-14 17:34:00 One thing is not clear: why would smb need an expensive bank service for crypto storing? Address+private key, written on a piece of paper is more than enough. And absolutely free.

5208 2018-11-14 17:33:14 Is this a paid shill 
5209 2018-11-14 17:33:11 The fact that two "camps" of an alt coin can cause such a major disruption in the crypto markets is a major reason why crypto has not gained mainstream (institutional appeal). There is tremendous risk putting capital at risk when it can be manipulated by Bitmain and Faketoshi
5210 2018-11-14 17:33:09 I like this one.
5211 2018-11-14 17:33:02 Wow, bold move! Interesting!

5238 2018-11-14 17:31:33 I just woke up, why is crypto crashing this time?
5239 2018-11-14 17:31:20 Nice 
5240 2018-11-14 17:31:19 Am so excited
5241 2018-11-14 17:31:15 If Bitcoin dies (for whatever reason, such as regulation)... it won't matter if you longed 20,000 or 5600 or 3000. We all lose roughly the same amount. Since (most) we are long term crypto bulls then figuring out which dip to buy is just a matter of opportunity cost.
5242 2018-11-14 17:31:13 1:33のリバ吹上、
550枚平均61万で売って、631500からロスカ発動、65万まで引き上げてる。
5243 2018-11-14 17:31:12 If anyone understands it is you... whether or not you care is a different question, but you have said many times over you are doing it to bring attention to crypto... what is the problem ppl are having??
5244 2018-11-14 17:31:06 Who cares if it’s coordinated or not , all that matters is that money was lost and made
5245 2018-11-14 17:31:05 great well i loaded up more btc just above 5550 <3

5262 2018-11-14 17:30:24 Best of luck out there CT. It’s a bloodbath and there is not end in sight. Fundamentals, IMO, are what truly matter. Revisit your positions and do a deep dive into each projects background. Happy hunting.
5263 2018-11-14 17:30:23 this looks like final capitulation to me. I hope it ends fast.
5264 2018-11-14 17:30:18 Been speaking about this for months. They simply will not let us go up without massive pain first. People have me so much hate for that. 
Wall Street was founded on greed. Will the elites all the sudden start giving hand outs overnight?
5265 2018-11-14 17:30:08 A lot of experts in the field who are used to seeing APT will chime in and give 10 ways to bypass such things — well mom and pop aren’t going to be hit by such things to begin with (unless they’re into dark web or crypto or etc.) My mom has been using a Mac for 14 years. Nothing.
5266 2018-11-14 17:30:07 What is @KaasyAi ? Knowledge as a Service. 
 The plan is to make rigs more profitable by making use of their full capabilities. Mining crypto and doing other processing tasks like machine learning at the same time!
Let’s unlock the full potential of blockchain.
5267 2018-11-14 17:30:05 Yeah i hope so!! I will buy everything!
5268 2018-11-14 17:30:01 Just always had a bad feeling about #Futures...still do, even more so. I liked pre-futures natural ups-downs. Anytime big money is makeable, the scalpers move in for the kill. Tainted now, #BTC has lost it's virginity, off to having 11 kids now. :(

Any coin that wishes to have a long lasting future needs to unpair from this slow, outdated & forking digital storage of value.

5324 2018-11-14 17:27:37 This is actually very plausible and makes sense. There is no other reason for $BTC to crash like this today (once it starting dropping then some retail herd behavior kicks in). Good call.

5416 2018-11-14 17:23:23 REKT PORTFOLIO : Crypto Market Wipes Out $8B, Bitcoin Cash Down 24.4% in 1 Week #cryptoking
5417 2018-11-14 17:23:22 Market red across the charts. $8B Market cap burned in less than 5 min. #cryptoking
5418 2018-11-14 17:23:22 What a bloodbath #cryptoking
5419 2018-11-14 17:23:22 In Mr. Robot (s3) the 1% tries to establish control with a digital centralized currency, but their only problem is... Bitcoin. #cryptoking
5420 2018-11-14 17:23:21 LAToken demands payment from Delta to list their ticker, then bans users asking about it. #cryptoking
5421 2018-11-14 17:23:20 check ETH/LTC/XRP vs BTC, not that dramatic and nice bounces. 
They might end in the green today
5422 2018-11-14 17:23:15 Serious money to be made now in crypto!! Buy this dip! #btc #bitcoin #eth #xrp #etc #zen #eos #crypto #bch
5423 2018-11-14 17:23:06 maybe this is just the beginning of the next big crash !?
another 90% down from this point ?
at least it is possible.
5424 2018-11-14 17:22:55 As REKT as @BitmexRekt 
5425 2018-11-14 17:22:53 just imagine when DR Doom.... sees this tweets....he's gonna have a field day in CT
5426 2018-11-14 17:22:51 @IvanOnTech Could one say that the crypto market crash happening right now is associated with a mining hash power shift in the bcash fork to an ASIC resistant mining algorithm, Sirs? @boxmining
5427 2018-11-14 17:22:49 TLの盛り上がりが退場話でまた界隈が寂しくなる予感(ノーポジでした)
5428 2018-11-14 17:22:49 It's still lol for you buddy? Still averaging down? 
5429 2018-11-14 17:22:49 This is a long term game for me. I want to make a lot of money (and help others) in the long term (think 3-5 years). Dips are blips on the radar. I'm very confident that my model will dramatically outperform. The main risk is crypto effectively dies (regulation, hack, etc)
5430 2018-11-14 17:22:47 J'ose pas...
5431 2018-11-14 17:22:44 It’s ok.  The #crypto market is just exhaling to rid itself of dirty air.  Prepare for a deep inhale shortly.....

5433 2018-11-14 17:22:41 I never expected to make any money, it was just to learn about how crypto worked but i invested in a mining contract right as BTC had a boom
5434 2018-11-14 17:22:39 Shoutout to @Crypto_Bitlord for saying shit was gonna be crazy. Don’t know about $4k homie but shit is really weird right now. I’m buying blood because I think the rebound will be swift and savage.
5435 2018-11-14 17:22:35 XRP is holding strong at 0.45 support. It's gonna take the 2nd place from ETH. 
It's time to change the No1. crypto as well. #XRP
5436 2018-11-14 17:22:34 ''it's a provable fact''
~proceeds to ignore actual ''provable'' part and fails to deliver proof~

Nah, the Q stuff is a huge troll by a bunch of Hackers and Remote Viewers on 8chan. 8chan is a weird place, a satanic dude on a board there started his personal #crypto army there.
5437 2018-11-14 17:22:26 Risk management plan has to be done in advance.

When you have been caught in the middle of the storm, the best you can do is to be patient and emotionless. 

Afterwards, learn from your mistakes and become stronger.
5438 2018-11-14 17:22:25 Yup, crypto is dead.
5439 2018-11-14 17:22:22 それは困ります。

5441 2018-11-14 17:22:14 Imagination can be tricky. Not that long ago people wondered why would anyone want a computer in their home, even Paul Krugman thought the Internet would have no impact on the economy. He's not a crypto currency fan, is he correct? #agiletd

5455 2018-11-14 17:21:49 Pro Tip: You can’t see how bad your crypto portfolio is doing if you don’t look at it.

5468 2018-11-14 17:21:11 #crypto is still so immature. a few hours wait on binance, a meaningless fork on btcash, and the market crashes like a teenager. i shorted the shit outta everything. it's nice to be old and wise.
5469 2018-11-14 17:21:06 There are only three Crypto God in entire universe

5475 2018-11-14 17:20:40 Отлично.
5476 2018-11-14 17:20:37 Don’t listen to the sheep. Bitcoin & Crypto is falling, just as we have predicted. Stay calm & remove emotions. Don’t panic, this is simply a normal market cycle. The Bear market still has some legs.  Video to come!

5486 2018-11-14 17:20:15 This is why retail buyers left crypto in droves in 2018. Whales and miners are cutting off their noses to spite their faces. You can only dump on people so many times.
5487 2018-11-14 17:20:14 The  Point  of  Crypto  isn’t  to  make  money  off  of  it  but  rather  a  means  of  transacting  privately

5500 2018-11-14 17:19:47 Are you laddering in once we hit 30 on the weekly RSI?
5501 2018-11-14 17:19:46 Futures expire today. #Tether premium is rising. Entire crypto is falling. BCH is engaging in a #HashWar.

We're making history, for better or worse.
5502 2018-11-14 17:19:43 In order for it to be a scam coin, there has to be malice.  There is none.
5503 2018-11-14 17:19:41 Crypto investors will do well mentally in the next recession.

Not because bitcoin is a hedge against macro instability (at least, today), but because bitcoiners are the only under 35 investors that have lived through multiple (crypto) recessions.

5507 2018-11-14 17:19:34 Noice. Thanks sir
5508 2018-11-14 17:19:34 Hello 5500? $BTC
5509 2018-11-14 17:19:29 Ummmm... You missed the 1st Hash War ever!!

BCH is using "Nakamoto Consensus" tomorrow to decide which software more closely follows the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto.

This will effect ALL of crypto as #Bitcoin (BCH) is the real Bitcoin.
5510 2018-11-14 17:19:28 As a minor panic takes hold amongst the crypto herd, a thought came to mind - what's the collective noun for crypto-nerds? So far we have: A Reddit of Crypto-Numpties; A Consensus of The Deluded; A Decentralisation of Fools. Feel free to add:)
5511 2018-11-14 17:19:23 Don’t worry too much about #Bitcoin sell off today because #Apple has also entered in a bear market today

5518 2018-11-14 17:18:52 Nice!!!!!
5519 2018-11-14 17:18:39 Havent really tweeted about crypto in a while, so i might as well go on a little crypto spree.

Ehhh, not really surprised. But didnt really call this. Have just left Bitcoin alone.

After it hits $5500 even lets see what it does from there. Could bounce, or... die

5535 2018-11-14 17:17:46 Finally!! The crash we have all been waiting for. Soak it in guys. THIS is the final dip before we hit the start of the bull run.

Let's see how low we go.

5536 2018-11-14 17:17:42 The real crypto currency is bitcoin,etherum and few coins whose demand and supply is created by people and can be exchange anytime anywhere! But these so called crypto coins in Uganda are total scam and fake! A real coin should be exchanged for other virtual money anytime!

5546 2018-11-14 17:17:17 2017: massive BTC bullrun leading up to CBOE & CME futures so the big fish can short it to hell.

2018: BTC tanks to yearly lows so that the big fish can buy back all the BTC cheap.

5559 2018-11-14 17:16:29 1) I'd also like to elaborate on my previous statement. This whole debacle is obviously being caused by that shit show bch that was spawned out of the fact that btc can't scale. This is nothing to do with xrp we're just being dragged down with the rest of the market. #XRP #crypto
5560 2018-11-14 17:16:25 If your invested in Crypto or AAPL, you're probably having a REALLY bad day, unless you had a short position open.  Buying APPL on dips, but being VERY conservative.
5561 2018-11-14 17:16:24 Stay calm, it is the BCH fork that's making the dip

5581 2018-11-14 17:15:19 You know, you can simply say that you were Wrong.

5629 2018-11-14 17:12:33 When I started trading #crypto I put in an amount of money I felt I could afford to lose. Then it balloned into an amount I don't feel OK about losing all of. Well its still just that seed I didn't care about, only now it's a big tree. Go ahead dump all my coins to zero. no cry!
5630 2018-11-14 17:12:32 Would you choose Lafite over Mouton?

5632 2018-11-14 17:12:26 i wouldn’t buy bitcoin yet. Asia is asleep. expect more panic when they wake up and realize crypto is crashing to new lows. $4900 would be a good buy area.
5633 2018-11-14 17:12:22 #Crypto Sell off

What next?

If you are a leverage trader, you can make money either ways by going long & short against key levels later in the day. Plenty of scalp opportunities to play retest of the low and bounce

If you are a LONG only Trader, it’s best to wait for stability

5741 2018-11-14 17:06:10 It definitely implies a problem. Means that Crypto is technically no different than Fiat currencies because its speculative.

5760 2018-11-14 17:05:21 Stock market taking a beating, too. Most people’s investments are down across the board — they just don’t know it yet because they don’t tend to look at the numbers as often as crypto folks do (for better or worse)
5761 2018-11-14 17:05:20 @visa is speaking at our conference and will highlight how they’ll use “crypto currency” for higher education. 

I assume it’ll be some bs but I’ll let ya know

5775 2018-11-14 17:04:42 I'm still in disbelief and not able to stay logged-in into Binance, so I really don't know what my account looks like and don't know what to do... Think I just have to wait, check my balance and reset stop losses in case of worse situation.
5776 2018-11-14 17:04:36 yeah thats true they do but when btc drops so do all related plays, sucks...i love crypto plays, but thats the market and reaction
5777 2018-11-14 17:04:27 Faxs.
5778 2018-11-14 17:04:22 Remember they said $5,000 Bitcoin before the bull run #crypto $BTC
5779 2018-11-14 17:04:21 Meh... manipulating the price down to 40-45 cents from where it was will save them what... like $100k when they start to buy out the sell orders? I think it’s just another random day in crypto.

5906 2018-11-14 16:59:42 You guys just screwed up my crypto plan. If you guys are not confident enough technically then just do not run the exchange.
5907 2018-11-14 16:59:37 lol had a crypto convo w/ uber driver a few weeks ago, is this a common theme with them? i only take uber maybe a couple times a month so small sample size for me and in Sac not SF
5908 2018-11-14 16:59:34 If you are stressing and can't handle these bigger price moves, close all your charts and everything else crypto related for a moment. Go and do something productive or something relaxing. Otherwise you'll do things you will regret later.

5954 2018-11-14 16:57:59 I can only dream of a 6k retest right now
5955 2018-11-14 16:57:56 Bug? Or server overload? It's quite common for Binance to freeze during high site traffic periods. Which makes sense considering crypto just crashed hard.
5956 2018-11-14 16:57:48 Ironic meme, but we still can get back old times and stimulate price growing, all that we need - adaptation. We need to support more projects like #MFChain making progress in globalization and $crypto adaptation.
5957 2018-11-14 16:57:45 Because I am very bullish on BTC and crypto and holding this 6k mark was important! I was sure we had a bottom! Yesterday I was doing a fibs lesson to my boys, I was talking about a lower bottom ha ha
5958 2018-11-14 16:57:41 @CryptoBrekkie would it be scam if crypto and iron-clad user control of data? Serious question. Or define scam. :)

5973 2018-11-14 16:57:06 It looks like all the other containers were blocked off and it would eventually overfill all the way over into 7
5974 2018-11-14 16:57:06 This has been a huge rotation out of momo #stocks and assets like #crypto and into value names. The question is will this continue? Some of the risk assets that are getting crushed are very difficult to value based on traditional measures. So no text book way to predict a bottom!
5975 2018-11-14 16:57:00 So how everyone in Crypto doing lmao we surviving
5976 2018-11-14 16:56:59 Once again... let’s see if #btc $btc is still in the toilet on, or after November 16th. This dump looks all too familiar #crypto

6035 2018-11-14 16:54:08 I haven’t talked a lot about #crypto but I will mention today they are all down big. Basically the riskier the asset class, the more it is down today. All the big coins are down 10% or more. Bitcoin $BTC now trading about $5,700, which would be a new 52-week low

6041 2018-11-14 16:53:59 There’s one upside crypto peeps have something to talk about now 
6042 2018-11-14 16:53:51 Nobody who is keen on crypto should ever miss out on this innovational project! @orvium
6043 2018-11-14 16:53:51 All the great news out everyday, every week in Crypto lately and the markets falling. Manipulation at its Finest.
6044 2018-11-14 16:53:42 is there such a thing as panic buying?
6045 2018-11-14 16:53:40 Everyone has had death threats who dares put these creepy crypto-Nazis in their place: Blasey Ford, Rick Wilson, etc...
6046 2018-11-14 16:53:39 Crypto harapan ni ala-ala macam 1mdb 2.0 ke?

6050 2018-11-14 16:53:26 Fuck the crypto markets.
6051 2018-11-14 16:53:26 It's unreal how many people are willing to take an insane risk right now.  Don't long this, don't buy BTC in a huge amount (just tiny amounts), don't short this.  Just relax and wait for CONFIRMATION of the price action.  This is why crypto people lose so much money.

6063 2018-11-14 16:52:48 Don't think it's a promising crypto project, for example, #MFChain is making a simple app for accepting and paying with ANY $crypto, multi blockchain ICO platform and etc. What about "Temco" voting platform with token rewards?  - Probably another shit token.
6064 2018-11-14 16:52:44 Is there any way we can ban the word PLUMMET from Crypto Twitter? Geez! Are there any others, that need to go?? #Tron $Trx

6066 2018-11-14 16:52:41 Down 10% today. Up 750% in two years, far less time than most traditional investments are held, and with a much higher return. As always, keep it perspective. It’ll pass.
6067 2018-11-14 16:52:40 Just interesting to me that it had been so quiet for so long...those crypto prices were pretty much in snooze mode for couple months now...hard fork for Bitcoin Cash taking its toll on entire ecosystem

6072 2018-11-14 16:52:26 "capitulation" So you think this is approximtely bottom ?
6073 2018-11-14 16:52:25 The #aim Market this year is so low on liquidity i do not see a rally before Xmas or early Q1, ppl pumping & selling on pre news!

6087 2018-11-14 16:51:46 risk: if the price of the backing crypto falls sharply enough, the “stablecoin” can become undercollateralized before it is liquidated, and lose its peg. this is exacerbated by operational and liquidity risks: enforcing the margin requires a price feed, which could become

6090 2018-11-14 16:51:37 I know - the BBC stands for Bitterite Broadcasting Corporation. That's why we need root and branch reform of it once JC wins. We can't let the media be controlled by crypto Tories and Blairite neoliberals. It must be by the people and for the people.

6099 2018-11-14 16:51:08 Market cap is still a silly measurement for crypto.

6106 2018-11-14 16:50:55 Looking at $BTCEUR, we do not have a lower low.
6107 2018-11-14 16:50:54 yes i did plenty of time still havent received the ignis

6109 2018-11-14 16:50:44 Well, now everyone owes @ToneVays  a slight apology for shorting the non bottom. Seems him and @crypto_birb we’re correct on their bearishness. Always pays off to have an open mind and prep for all scenarios.

6115 2018-11-14 16:50:16 Exactly, they're further distancing themselves from what makes BTC & all crypto special: decentralization. The inability to run nodes on their network will render them useless and no different from other payment networks—even the main advocates for BCH are 'realizing' this now
6116 2018-11-14 16:50:15 Say good btw to crypto twitter
6117 2018-11-14 16:50:14 Just needed a quick refresher
6118 2018-11-14 16:50:13 #Etheera (#ETA), #Ethereum-based real estate token project, gains 80,000% in 14 days. Caution. This is pump and dump that’s bound to fail. Pro tip: how to spot a pump-and-dump? It only trades on one exchange and has a very low volume.  #WeissRatings #crypto #altcoins

Crude Crashing.
Crypto Crashing.

Tomorrow = Dollar Crashing
Friday = E-mini S&P Crashing

That's how it works, right? Markets collapse in alphabetical order, right?
6128 2018-11-14 16:49:40 Each new node on a crypto network has a delay between the time when it joins the network and the time where it can validate.

6157 2018-11-14 16:48:13 Seems one more #Hopium (expectation of 2017 bull run reiteration in Nov-Dec'18) is about to crash finally with $BTC panic selling.

It was a nice small cap alts season tho. Excellent profits.

6173 2018-11-14 16:47:39 $LTC is the least exciting crypto from top 20. No smell, no taste. If it remains there until end of 2019 I'm going to eat my own... vegetables!

6194 2018-11-14 16:46:41 Finally a move breaking the range for $BTC, things will get interesting soon . Not entering any long until bitcoin can find a support. Not knife catching a move like this.
6195 2018-11-14 16:46:36 BTW i appreciate you reporting from the front lines, all other crypto "traders" from my feed are loud mouths, always beating their chests but when the real action hits... silence....  COWARDS.
6196 2018-11-14 16:46:35 i think btc will b ded by then bruh
6197 2018-11-14 16:46:34 The total market cap decline at the moment makes nervous. But okay, fingers crossed for a quick bounce then.

6207 2018-11-14 16:45:58 そっちはオーガーだな。賭け事と保険を綯い交ぜにした実験トークンだ。来年の作物は今年より豊作かどうかなど、投票して賭けていく。農家は凶作に賭け続けるだけで、勝っても負けても美味しいとこ取りになる。リスクを分散できる優れものだ。予測市場なので凶作予想なら素直に畑を休ませるのも良いぞ。

6243 2018-11-14 16:44:28 Ngl it's fucking hilarious The way people freak out when their investment slightly decreases in value. If you aren't confident in the future why are you invested in the first place? This is crypto, it's not like you weren't warned. #XRPcommunity #cryptocurrency #XRP #Crypto

This is what competitors don't realize. A large, passionate community on top of an already functioning platform is extremely difficult to disrupt.

6321 2018-11-14 16:40:19 Now, I'm not a trader myself, so I may be wrong, but such possibilities were in the cards for quite a while already. Going long on BCH was imho a bad move at any point in the past half year, if not longer... Sure people will be pissed at all of crypto, doesn't mean they're right.
6322 2018-11-14 16:40:19 Crude crashed yesterday, Crypto crashed today -- maybe it is a sign that liquidity in global markets is very thin.
6323 2018-11-14 16:40:19 I rarely make a great decision. I make a lot of terrible ones. But my great one in the last couple of years has been to stay out of #Bitcoin. It was a great decision not because of price movement, but the overwhelming fixation it seems to elicit. #Crypto #Bitcoin

Or

Or something else?

That's gotta be the worst value proposition I've ever seen
6352 2018-11-14 16:39:24 Today , the #crypto market is as red as me!!!
6353 2018-11-14 16:39:23 Interesting sight, watching my entire watchlist flashing in dire, desperate red. 

Strong, extreme emotions are reduced to red flickering numbers.

6361 2018-11-14 16:39:10 "Capitulation is when investors give up any previous gains in a market by selling their positions during periods of declines. Capitulation can happen at any time, but typically happens during high volume trading and extended declines for securities."

Any positive side to it?

6366 2018-11-14 16:38:59 This is all caused by @BitMEXdotcom if you want me to be honest. They got the masses opening longs/shorts vs owning physical crypto. Sad sad

6368 2018-11-14 16:38:55 That will put an end to Roger and Jihan. When we get rid off Roger and Jihan, there will be pure rise of crypto and justice
6369 2018-11-14 16:38:50 Legal and regulated loses any value when inspections are halted for fear of being cast as crypto anti-choice. See Gosnell's not being inspected for years.

6384 2018-11-14 16:38:16 Whether the big bounce comes here or not, crypto needed this volume capitulation to create some action for a reversal. We shall see.
6385 2018-11-14 16:38:13 That was a fucking mega dump
6386 2018-11-14 16:38:08 and @binance would not let me stay logged in let only sell  Cost me a couple thousand XRP!Fuck crypto for 2018 I’ll get back to this in 2019

6389 2018-11-14 16:37:43 This is true..I swear it's like the crypto market was set up to have BTC manipulate the market..The bags I'm holding I'm not worried about..sitting in a cold wallet and if BTC goes to 0 I know they will be the few that survive.
6390 2018-11-14 16:37:28 Friendly reminder that $BTC is king and will fuck up your alt positions 

Why am I enjoying this dump so much?
Probably because we’ve been sideways forever now and I’ve been starved of action

6396 2018-11-14 16:37:12 What just happened in the crypto market was the final straw to weed out the weak. I'm not selling anything that I have as our timeline(1/2)

6415 2018-11-14 16:36:22 Did you see all the crypto?! WTF?!
6416 2018-11-14 16:36:14 Saw some bitcoin and crypto talk a couple of days ago. I recall someone posting they were waiting for BTC to go over $7,000 before buying. The community allows brief snippets of crypto, ES, NQ & NG commentary before raging at those participants to get back on message with oil.
6417 2018-11-14 16:36:09 good offer
6418 2018-11-14 16:36:05 Did you think this was going to be easy? Hopefully this is the last bloodbath before we soar.  #Cryptocurrency #crypto #bitcoin

6444 2018-11-14 16:35:07 Ratios are very important to take into account when modelling out crypto valuations. I hardly look at fiat pairing - anyone who is long term bullish shouldn't care for present prices. We're in profit on all our portfolios, in BTC and USD. Up 5x since Jan 18

6474 2018-11-14 16:34:04 Is this related to crypto crash?
6475 2018-11-14 16:34:03 And why it happened? Because everyone saying "crypto need adaptation" but no one doing anything for that. Only a few projects like #MFChain, but that's not enough.
6476 2018-11-14 16:34:01 It's not just because some people disagree.  It's because he's a crypto-fascist.
6477 2018-11-14 16:34:00 gotta drop so institutional buyers can get in cheap :)

6492 2018-11-14 16:33:29 Complete mayhem has hit the crypto market. Where is the volatility you said ?
6493 2018-11-14 16:33:29 These are centralized.
6494 2018-11-14 16:33:24 Crypto market is a mess 
6495 2018-11-14 16:33:24 Don't check crypto prices right now if you're long. Crypto is getting whacked! $BTC $ETH $LTC. Selloff seems to have been triggered by $BCH impending fork.
6496 2018-11-14 16:33:23 Thankyou

6508 2018-11-14 16:32:54 How about the irony of the new face of crypto evil being the Fake Satoshi?  Causing damage like Roger Ver, but during a bear market environment.  The crypto community will AGAIN be forced to band together.  Only this time, the enemy is FAR weaker.  Absolutely NUTS!
6509 2018-11-14 16:32:53 s/o to all the delusional perma-bulls that can’t see past trend and continue to shill crypto and $BTC like we are on the rocket ship in 2017...news flash: it’s 2018...and who are you to honestly say price will *never* reach a certain territory again—no one knows wtf btc will do
6510 2018-11-14 16:32:50 Wow here is the drop  Only in #crypto can you watch your money bleed and still feel excitement for what’s next

6526 2018-11-14 16:32:19 If Id get 1 #bitcoin everytime I hear/read that #cryptos are going to be #bulish soon, the #bitcoins I would have gotten would be a lot less worth now. #Crypto #blockchain #altcoins
6527 2018-11-14 16:32:19 This has been the 2nd time that I know of that she has said this.
Hope someone is listening to her this time.

Yet I fear it has something more to do with a "stable coin" that is not $BTC and looks more like freaking Tether.

6533 2018-11-14 16:32:08 Thanks TA! Always appreciate being on your list of mentors, honored to be with this all star group.
6534 2018-11-14 16:32:05 
6535 2018-11-14 16:32:05 Good luck
6536 2018-11-14 16:32:02 This is when your plan comes in to play. You might be wanting to panick. I encourage you to instead be joyful because volatility is what we want. Movement is what we want. If it moves down fast that means the upwards movement is coming soon after. What are you buying today?
6537 2018-11-14 16:32:00 This action taken by Probit Exchange is one of its kind in the crypto space...truly innovative and congratulations to the winners.

6608 2018-11-14 16:29:25 If I thought more people would get the pun I would definitely use 'Hard Tines' in a headline
6609 2018-11-14 16:29:23 there's nothing like that sinking feeling watching the whole #crypto market dump simultaneously
6610 2018-11-14 16:29:22 "Crypto leaders"? They lead what exactly?
6611 2018-11-14 16:29:21 You should be back at work.

6686 2018-11-14 16:26:07 What other markets are looking at now besides crypto?
6687 2018-11-14 16:26:06 If your judgement leads you to this, then make your decisions to avoid what you dislike quietly. If you don't like something in a capitalistic state, you cast your vote by not paying for it. Don't hate on other's business model, clearly its meeting a demand that others value.
6688 2018-11-14 16:26:04 I never would want folks to agree with everything I say. What fun would that be!

6713 2018-11-14 16:24:38 When Bitcoin dies, be sure all other crypto coins die with him! Thats a fact!

6718 2018-11-14 16:24:28 nicee
6719 2018-11-14 16:24:27 So much for #Bitcoin stability.  As I expected, the crypto currency has finally broken to the downside.  Lots of crypto cheerleaders confidently proclaimed that a bottom had been forming.  With Bitcoin breaking below $5800, it seems that the bottom was actually a trap door!
6720 2018-11-14 16:24:26 Solche Einbrüche habe ich schon viele gesehen. Aber btc ist trotzdem erstaunlich resilent, obwohl der crypto space fast nur noch aus Tradern und Betrügern besteht. Es bleibt spannend..
6721 2018-11-14 16:24:24 I was in a room filled with corporate executives today, brainstorming about building a full fledged crypto based on blockchain for charity.

6724 2018-11-14 16:24:16 I almost panicked today after seeing how #crypto twitter reacted to a dump. Then I opened the $btc chart to find a 3% loss... if that’s the new volatility standard I am back to trading currencies.

6748 2018-11-14 16:23:27 The universe does seem to have a sense of humor...     I will say, however, that the internals of the crypto market looked pretty bad to me yesterday, and I said that during a couple of Coinroutes demos...

6751 2018-11-14 16:23:20 Why would Bitcoin be considered money? Even crypto leaders have abandoned the thought of it as a means of payment.

6779 2018-11-14 16:22:03 What!? Please explain
6780 2018-11-14 16:22:01 Because in other markets you don't deal with kids wannabe investors. In crypto, the bar is pretty low, basically non-existing.
6781 2018-11-14 16:22:01 While hacking on memory protection for integrity+privacy I realized that for keys to be leak free there are several integrity properties required, which I find to be an odd asymmetry, and wondered if there was some type of crypto theory/conversation on the topic.

Sorry for calling out facts. Normally that’s a good thing.
6800 2018-11-14 16:20:30 Any idea why crypto is tanking right now? Several of the top cryptos have dropped 10% in the past 24 hours. #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #blockchain
6801 2018-11-14 16:20:27 I still don’t get how these stable coins equal $1usd yet they will go above & under that
6802 2018-11-14 16:20:25 Agreed. Blockchain concept is hard to grasp, it’s either used without any real understanding or applied in models that don’t make sense. Everyone has a different idea of “crypto” & “blockchain”, but an easy way to spot someone’s credibility is ask them what they think of Bitcoin

7111 2018-11-14 15:56:06 That is so sick. I love it. An interesting aspect of this could be evaluating GPU stats as well - assuming there's a good benchmark for it - which would give crypto miners a leg up (I mean, you could charge them for that and they'd pay for it). This was fantastic.

7164 2018-11-14 15:51:32 @WilliamShatner with regards to crypto: I would recommend following @jchervinsky @Crypto_Macro @woonomic @RamenofBinance @MatiGreenspan and @CryptoShillNye they will help you keep your head on. Have a beautiful day!
7165 2018-11-14 15:51:26 By the way all you Twitter idiots.... @ToneVays would be in profit right now. Bow down to a crypto OG and stop following these December 2018 dickheads!
7166 2018-11-14 15:51:20 Partnerships Hype is dead in 2017  just look at ICON  ..Next wave of hype will be mass adoption hype
7167 2018-11-14 15:51:17 I have high limits as well.. but still. I learned from @haydentiff 16 months ago following her on Twitter: if you don’t own your keys you don’t own your crypto! Thanks Tiffany! 
7168 2018-11-14 15:51:13 Or try another exchange service :)

7177 2018-11-14 15:50:25 My biggest problem is that right now it’s only value is speculative. Nobody actually transacts with bitcoin. Will it eventually become the new gold? Maybe, but there’s so many different coins and crypto currencies out there now that it’s hard to say bitcoin will be the main one

When mass adoption hits there will be PLENTY of tx to mine. Fees do not need to be high W/ billions of tx per day

7298 2018-11-14 15:39:19 great news
7299 2018-11-14 15:39:14 it's just people taking money to buy xmas gifts. we'll be at ATH in January when wall street put their Bonus's in to crypto.
7300 2018-11-14 15:39:07 Muzika has attracted key advisors at the forefront of the Korean technology and music entertainment industries to its advisory board. 
Such an excellent project!

7301 2018-11-14 15:39:03 Very good
7302 2018-11-14 15:39:03 If Bitcoin goes down, it would take all the smart contract platforms with it and in this case Chainlink would be useless.
7303 2018-11-14 15:39:01 $TLRY a lot of people are baggin on this stock but in my eyes its pretty simple. just like crypto theres very little competitors and its a relatively new market. over time this stock will re-adjust but in the meantime its going to fluctuate a lot so dont be quick to throw it away
7304 2018-11-14 15:38:52 Oh lord , crypto is such an enticing buy these days.
7305 2018-11-14 15:38:48 Bittikçe ambale oluyorum
7306 2018-11-14 15:38:37 ビビって買い戻しちゃった笑
7307 2018-11-14 15:38:36 Did we skyrocket on 5th november?

Emi yoshikawa @emy_wng tweeted about this but since everything after 24h in crypto is considered old news

I just want to remind people that BG is having another talk on m2020china 

I know nothing about price actions ever

7313 2018-11-14 15:38:14 yeah i know but this still looks shitty
7314 2018-11-14 15:37:47 Low volume on these sell offs, so far...
7315 2018-11-14 15:37:39 here in twitter crypto space, everyone is specialist ...
7316 2018-11-14 15:37:20 That was probably a connectivity issue on your end, can you try refreshing the page? If it still doesn't work, hit up support. :D
7317 2018-11-14 15:37:15 You don't have to agree but if it is the leader in oracles and off-chain computation, then yes, i trust it more than Bitcoin. It would have way way more functionality and use at that point.
7318 2018-11-14 15:37:13 Als ik naar mijn crypto kijk
7319 2018-11-14 15:37:12 @Stillman_Crypto wish i did that thread 2 months ago already...imagine the clout hahahahha
7320 2018-11-14 15:37:12 Agreed. I'm very concerned for the future of crypto.
My prediction:
Gov takes the crypto space and enslaves all until AI takes over gov and frees those worth freeing.
The fascists and warmongers will be eliminated.
The rest of us will live in a utopia loved by AI like pets.
7321 2018-11-14 15:36:53 
7322 2018-11-14 15:36:48 They are separate issues.  Where are the use cases?  What’s the problem with real world payment systems that crypto somehow solves?
7323 2018-11-14 15:36:43 Great!!!

7326 2018-11-14 15:36:36 75% $XRP, well, guys, this is why we are dumping. Still too much dumb money in $crypto.
7327 2018-11-14 15:36:34 Is it a confirmed short? If it is, he really faked it
7328 2018-11-14 15:36:21 @LeeR912 do you know why this crypto dump happening? Thanks
7329 2018-11-14 15:36:13 Crypto>Education system!
7330 2018-11-14 15:36:08 Not true.  Sec has been granted oversight over crypto.  They are already pursuing ICO's for example

7355 2018-11-14 15:34:21 Plus all of the problems in the crypto market - exit scams, market manipulation, most ICOs are total frauds, lack of legal protection and market regulation.  Problems that are extremely rare in the real stock market are prevalent in crypto.

7370 2018-11-14 15:33:29 1 $TRX per $WIN would ONLY imply a market cap of $20M USD.

$20M is potatoes in the #Crypto industry. It's baby food.

1:1 on WIN would fetch ~800%+ R.O.I.

7381 2018-11-14 15:32:52 We went from $500 billion market cap to $200 billion in one year.  And that’s highly inflated - no one thinks there’s enough depth to support mass cash outs without prices tanking.  There’s no real world adoption of crypto at all.  It was a bubble and now it’s popping.

7416 2018-11-14 15:30:23 Well I think that I very well do understand #crypto & #blockchain . And the significance it may have some day.
And that's probably a very good reason why I, and many others within the #XRPcommunity , just own #XRP and not #Bitcoin ?

7441 2018-11-14 15:28:19 Scott Nelson w SweetBridge has some interesting YouTube videos discussing how massive global trade / supply chains are and how woefully inefficient they are.

7464 2018-11-14 15:26:24 A lot of ideas many of them shot down by the Est Dems who have been saying oh that’s too much we can’t do that now. That incrementalism is why the crypto fascists were able to come into power. You don’t go to war with a bitter knife against a relentless adversary.

Let me tell you the story on this one. It’s a doozy. 

So, I met this guy via the Internet, in a random crypto chat. He legit said “looking for salesman”

Boy, was I the first one to hop on.

7469 2018-11-14 15:26:03 After you have a few bear markets experiences like me, you tend to be less scared and see the final outcome clearer.  The final outcome will be a multi trillion dollar crypto industry but it takes decades and not years.  Amazon took 9 yrs to come back to ATH after the 2001 crash.

7477 2018-11-14 15:25:40 Herding is the most dangerous thing in crypto. People pile into trades creating major overreaction causing major price distortions. Usually the herd loses

1. Disciplined traders have to be very very patient. 

2. Tactical traders can front run the herd... very hard but doable

7482 2018-11-14 15:25:18 Interesting concept, but the initial price point for Coinmine hardware could be prohibitive for the majority of the population. Any mom-and-pops can use their existing desktop/laptops for mining the most profitable coins by installing @TeamWinMiner on their OS - better ROI.

7486 2018-11-14 15:24:34 Whether or not people move from saving cash to gold or from cash to crypto is neither a matter of concern for me, the importance is that people become aware that saving paper is not the most effective means to preserve wealth.

7512 2018-11-14 15:21:54 Nope. Neither. Most big co.s aren't interested in enforcing patents. They file them *defensively*

If BoA wants to move into crypto in future (and doesn't have its own patents), they will be vulnerable to competitors with patents in the space.

See Yahoo v. (pre-IPO) FB in 2012

7598 2018-11-14 15:12:23 It does seem like something is about to happen in the crypto space. Been too quiet for sometime now. $BTC triangle range getting narrower too.
7599 2018-11-14 15:12:18 i use chrome and it works fine :D i can drive anything including elliot waves.
7600 2018-11-14 15:12:17 It's a great pleasure, to be able to donate the enormous computing power of today’s gaming graphic cards, and home PC processors to science projects. Folks, don't waste it for crypto coins, science is what makes the world a better place! #Beacon4Science @team_csf

7602 2018-11-14 15:12:11 I’ve also heard about some #crypto #dfs websites, but I forget the website I heard about. Can anyone shill me some links? #btc #nfl #dfs
7603 2018-11-14 15:12:08 I probably wouldn't show up anyway
7604 2018-11-14 15:12:06 It impacts the overall risk of the crypto space when childish antics like what is happening with $BCH can actually happen
7605 2018-11-14 15:11:58 If @binance or @UpholdInc where ever to be hacked, they would do everything possible to get your crypto back. If not, im told you would be reimbursed if it was found to not be your own fault.

7626 2018-11-14 15:09:41 In my very humble opinion only concerning this one thing, I would agree with @galgitron. Although I enjoy watching Susie's videos, this crypto field is a totally new animal and years of experience in any financial market doesn't necessarily translate. Tech understanding prevails
7627 2018-11-14 15:09:39 Technically that's what using crypto would look like for them. At this point it's not different from magical spacebux, except you'll easily find someone to trade it for real money.
7628 2018-11-14 15:09:35 Crypto-mining is like installing solar panels, why wouldn't you do it? Well it was too expensive and used up too much electricity. @coinmine launches today and sips power like a Playstation. Why wouldn't you now? @farbood @BrianNorgard

7651 2018-11-14 15:08:16 @mappopk_crypto nice
7652 2018-11-14 15:08:16 i like this forward development of crypto
7653 2018-11-14 15:08:13 I really think that part of this downward trend has to do with the nonsense that is going on with BCH and the threat to mine empty blocks all of that is really scaring the people that are new to crypto and I think that they are pulling money out

7681 2018-11-14 15:05:22 Do not use SMS for 2-factor-authentication. It is not safe.

Use an app like Google Authenticator instead, especially when it involves crypto assets / exchange accounts.

Furthermore, do not store your crypto on an exchange, unless it is absolutely necessary.

What do you think?:)
7690 2018-11-14 15:04:34 Again, this isn't good news, C.banks issuing their own crypto means they'll employ the same dirty monetary policies with their own crypto (CBDC's), what will happen to existing ones?

7707 2018-11-14 15:03:13 Yeah they could even get seismic data to trigger house insurance for an earthquake. Or even a police report could trigger that. Maybe it's not plausible but an interesting idea.
7708 2018-11-14 15:03:08 The market needs to understand if crypto starts to move in the next 45 days there will be a slight stock market "crash" as investors sell stocks to raise cash to buy crypto. They will be inversely related as stock investors also lock in their gains and losses for tax purposes

Because  all what I see they just do "giveaways".  We need something, that will bring $crypto in masses like $MFX.

We know they're the leader in dec oracles, but teams are also viewing them as the leader in secure smart contracts (off-chain computation). This is huge and maybe a bigger market than oracles.

7860 2018-11-14 14:47:14 IMO With the proposed tax cuts and trade wars trump admin have made,  for the first time in a long time it puts to much pressure on t he feds to print money in recession. Also let’s not forget all the warning signs of a massive US treasury sell off when it hits the fan.

7921 2018-11-14 14:41:24 You are also asking members of a coin who have it because of the anonymity to register to vote here, thus losing some of their anonymity. I am sure each coin has its people who will do the tricks as you outlined for that 1 or 2 extra votes. Important thing is keeping bots away.

If they actually understood the significance crypto, they would obviously own Bitc…
7938 2018-11-14 14:39:48 @Azure and @kubernetesio too
7939 2018-11-14 14:39:47 Because fundamentally crypto is moving forward on a daily basis. We are reaching make or break point where if the right big players don't jump on board and we break yearly support, we will most likely face a cold few years. Its hard to be bearish with so much progress being made.
7940 2018-11-14 14:39:44 はい！！
7941 2018-11-14 14:39:33 Problem is Crypto in and of itself has no fundamental value aside from its practical use. Plus its value is prospective, only worth as much as people are willing to perceive it as. Same as paper. Addition, u need paper money to invest in it (Fiat currency).

8024 2018-11-14 14:31:48 Digital currencies exist already and have existed for 40 years. Dollar has been digital since the 80s. Crypto digital currencies is what is looked at today based on fiat not a mathematical formula like bitcoin.
8025 2018-11-14 14:31:37 Your underrated , Crypto’s hidden Gem .
8026 2018-11-14 14:31:33 Do you post similar stuff everyday?
8027 2018-11-14 14:31:31 Bir fud da BTC'ye atayım o zaman. Bu adamlar hash kazanmak için paralarını harcarken olay Bitcoinlerin bozulması noktasına gelirse

लेकिन फिर भी वह बार बार एक चीज पर अटक जाते है. 

कुछ वही हाल देश में #Crypto को लेकर भी है.

8031 2018-11-14 14:30:59 $crypto?
8032 2018-11-14 14:30:57 yes.. they are about to launch their product in coming month #cashaa
8033 2018-11-14 14:30:57 Maybe I will restart my mining rig this weekend and see if its profitable. Might mine bch abc, thier hashrate seems to be pretty low 
8034 2018-11-14 14:30:49 Come on now, it wasn't totally an inaccurate piece. This quote is spot on: "Since the most contentious (from a philosophical perspective) part of the community amputated itself into Bitcoin Cash, it should not be a surprise that they are capable of further self-mutilation"
8035 2018-11-14 14:30:32 He’s not answering you because he’s already responded to the exact same accusations time and time again. It’s boring at this point.
8036 2018-11-14 14:30:31 Thats stupid
8037 2018-11-14 14:30:25 $LTC volume spike. 1699 coin print at $48.00.  $LTCUSD #LTCUSD #LTC #Litecoin #coinbase #gdax
8038 2018-11-14 14:30:22 Soon another platform #Cashaa is going to be lauch and this will easily surpass #coinbase because of their less #fee and inbuilt #IBAN account #cashaa #cas #blockchain #bitcoin

8040 2018-11-14 14:30:20 Well I am following only those who I am good friends with. But that doesn’t mean cryptocred is any less. I have mentioned him several times in past. He is fantastic so yes for sure follow him @CryptoCred
8041 2018-11-14 14:30:18 やろう！
8042 2018-11-14 14:30:12 3. I have seen some startups from Tanzania around blockchain Belfrics and the other, which they are yet in beta or pilot. An overall understanding of blockchain is poor and we are not structured to have support systems for such innovations. After all crypto is threat to govts
8043 2018-11-14 14:30:10 Was wondering the same...so basically like elons "not a flamethrower"... conversation piece
8044 2018-11-14 14:30:01 本当ですか！！じゃあこのタッチでいかせてもらいます！！
8045 2018-11-14 14:29:43 でも要点纏めるのうまいですね！さすがです！
ところでウィムやりませんか？
8046 2018-11-14 14:29:37 Faketoshi idiot
8047 2018-11-14 14:29:32 ya i agree its pretty redic & most of these ICOs prob should have hedged their crypto exposure & sold to fiat to secure longer runway

(2) kind of makes sense tho -- w all the lack of delivering pls do spend some $$ recruiting smart devs to actually launch some of these networks
8048 2018-11-14 14:29:30 vechain is the best crypto company with huge partnerships, if you really cannot see the potential and you only care about the price  ,you really should not be in crypto
I am actually hoping it goes way lower so I can buy more
8049 2018-11-14 14:29:30 Is it indian??
8050 2018-11-14 14:29:29 Voodoman Y so bad tho?

8056 2018-11-14 14:28:56 Looking at the IMF coming on board with crypto. 100 B moved around the globe with a click of a mouse makes sense without spending so much dollars. 

Bitcoin is increasing in adoption not because of speed but because of its reconciliation features.

8061 2018-11-14 14:28:32 @mappopk_crypto nice
8062 2018-11-14 14:28:28 surprisingly @CryptoCred didn't make this list maybe he's not a mentor just the best fucking educator out there 
8063 2018-11-14 14:28:26 @mappopk_crypto good
8064 2018-11-14 14:28:24 I didn’t say anything against capitalism or in-favor of post-modernism. I’m merely pointing out that the tendency of middle America to attack liberals as somehow evil incarnate, and to frame them all as crypto-communists, is pathetic, self-pitying and baseless.

8072 2018-11-14 14:27:33 You can’t ignore someone who promotes Blockchain/Crypto more than top 10 crypto twitter accounts combined. He helps bring new investors. Need to learn how he does that. This asset class won’t grow without addition of new investors

Exposing #crypto is absolutely essential

8074 2018-11-14 14:27:27 Yes he's contributing a lot,but maybe he isn't the best person to be the face of crypto

8083 2018-11-14 14:26:50 What proof do you have that he is not? BTW I’m not saying he is. But you are making statements that you can’t back up. Is it possible he is Satoshi? Yes. At some point I think we will find out who Satishi is because there is no way his wallet will stay inactive forever.

8088 2018-11-14 14:26:27 2. I think there is trouble in focus and how truly people takes the blockchain and crypto industry, you may recall during blockchain event one lady asked about the main agenda being around crypto while there are many other use cases.
8089 2018-11-14 14:26:25 this war will bring down BTC, because both sides will sell BTC to hold their positions, very bad for crypto and it will bring BTC under 6k
8090 2018-11-14 14:26:20 Wow!! Fantastic

8104 2018-11-14 14:25:00 hopefully you'll delete your account.. But i know the guys as you.. Probably you won't do anything if btc continue over 6k. Maximum you'll change your username and avatar, and continue to speculate, manipulate people cheekily!

8110 2018-11-14 14:24:47 Internet stocks, Crypto, FAANG, Pot - trend continues. Reverting to mean is real.
8111 2018-11-14 14:24:40 It may be the same with TF, as long as other are using it, it can be useful... also, I think many pro traders have "working hours" and volume spikes can be spotted based on that
8112 2018-11-14 14:24:39 Thank you  I hope everything is good! 
8113 2018-11-14 14:24:36 and the crazy thing is: this wasn't even a crash
after a crash we see BTC below USD 1'000
in the crazy crypto world this is just a healthy correction 
8114 2018-11-14 14:24:18 Nope. That’s the down side to crypto

8123 2018-11-14 14:23:28 I wonder how much of a boost this will provide to crypto currencies, if they sort their shit out that is.
8124 2018-11-14 14:23:23 Don't you make income from trading? 
8125 2018-11-14 14:23:05 Hahahahahaahhaha a onda pacovi kolo vode
8126 2018-11-14 14:23:01 Charlie Munger, the Vice Chairman of Warren Buffett's investment titan, Berkshire Hathaway, has compared crypto trading to the sale of harvested baby brains.

But what does he actually mean by this?

8139 2018-11-14 14:22:09 Thoughts on testing (smart contract) design with ML agents before deploying to real users.
One of the biggest values in simulating (crypto)economic systems is probably the ability to *put a number* on intuitions and qualitative assumptions, e.g.:
8140 2018-11-14 14:21:51 @Thrillmex show us the chart for oil $$$ dumping

8142 2018-11-14 14:21:37 Why would a Hindu rashtra require a foreign made fighter aircraft ?

Shouldn't Interstellar Pushpak Vimana be more than enough ? 

Why is this sanskari Hindu guy even working with a non-hindu crypto Christian company?

...
And many more questions lie unanswered.

8150 2018-11-14 14:20:59 True. This is why marketing is so critical. Crypto missing to complete ‘whole’ to be real success. To much focus on ideology not enough w/ customer experience.

8204 2018-11-14 14:15:01 I'd have to agree with Bambou. Your downside is certainly not limited in this scenario. It's also not impossible, however unlikely, that BCHABC reclaims the majority of BCH.
8205 2018-11-14 14:14:58 1D n 12Hrs to go for BCH fork. Eager to see the post fork reaulta of war between   BCHABC and BCHSV. This is the first Fork war of its kind. 
Will Roger Ver and Bitmain be bankrupt post BCH fork?

8207 2018-11-14 14:14:49 Yes, but why? If you're doing KYC, why bother? Just use a big fat database and go crazy. Why crypto? And harmonized regulations just means there's no room to maneuver. Allright, I'm going to go do some work now. I'm bumming myself out.

8221 2018-11-14 14:13:10 BTC'ye karşı olay baya sonrası için bir teori, şuan birbirleriyle uğraşıyorlar. Bitmain hash taşırsa kendini SV'ye karşı korumak için olur. Mesele şirket içi sıkıntı çıkmadan yapıp yapamayacakları. Bence aslında o kadar da zor bir olay değil onlar için. Hash savaşını kaybetmeleri

8237 2018-11-14 14:12:35 @mappopk_crypto Hello
8238 2018-11-14 14:12:29 I think your video and subsequent podcast brought home the potential impact i.e. existential threat for all of crypto.

Something central banks would love - at least while they roll out unfree competing digital currencies.
8239 2018-11-14 14:12:26 So it's buying time 
8240 2018-11-14 14:12:22 All crypto must be a scam by this logic...

8250 2018-11-14 14:11:12 Tether is not backed by USD or has regular audits like thier website claims. It's backed by Crypto currency portfolio. There are so many alts paired with tether now that they seem to be able to manipulate those markets with ease.

They're always seeking the jurisdiction offering the best laws & regulations for crypto assets.

thats a compliment btw as you know.

8335 2018-11-14 14:03:38 It will take a long time until mainstream media will understand crypto. Probably never.

8339 2018-11-14 14:03:16 This is one of the projects that should get more attention from the public. They are doing hard work on an actual real world business. And good work to. So people keep an eye out for them.

8361 2018-11-14 14:01:08 If crypto is used no 1 is avoiding tax. It's full control. It's the entire point of this. Faster settlements is of course a bonus

8371 2018-11-14 13:59:20 People forget that all of the (legitimate, aka didn't open after 2018 bull run and suddenly get hundreds of millions of $ volume a day)  crypto exchanges have hundreds of millions of dollars in capital and every reason imaginable to not get on the bad side of regulators

8383 2018-11-14 13:57:38 So sad: too many people in our industry actually don’t understand #crypto. 

How can I tell? Because they don’t own #Bitcoin! (They’re all just blabbering about #Blockchain...)

If they actually understood the significance crypto, they would obviously own Bitcoin by now. Too bad!

8388 2018-11-14 13:57:08 What matters in terms of governance is “what software will the community run?”. As in, do they run software that supports big blocks or not, segwit, etc. The Electric Coin Company is nothing but a *provider of software*. We can't decide for anyone else whether they'll run it.
8389 2018-11-14 13:57:06 I think what you mean is that they haven't mooned yet like they did in 2017. You bet your butt if we get to several trillion or more total market cap we will have idiots making fortunes on shitcoins just like 2017 and before.
8390 2018-11-14 13:56:39 This is the exact reason more people are not in crypto. It’s a fault not a feature.
8391 2018-11-14 13:56:25 I think this article is lie. 
8392 2018-11-14 13:56:21 Because Hitbtc is a real thief. Hitbtc gave my PRGs 8 months later after I made my support request. Ridiculous!!!
8393 2018-11-14 13:56:01 I agree with you. But a few billion is not much in the bigger picture.
We are in peak position. The transition of fiat to crypto. The stepping stone. 
They will have to take a hit for us 1 percent to pump the price up, then they will get the 99 other percent in for adoption. $$$
8394 2018-11-14 13:55:48 +1 for $CHX

8465 2018-11-14 13:49:16 I agree that this is something the majority of people or financial institutions will use as oppose to securing their crypto in a nano ledger.The banks would also charge security fees to make some money.thats how things work and am fine with that,we need these solutions 1/2
8466 2018-11-14 13:49:13 Bitcoin Air off chaining feature makes it very unique and different from other payment Crypto tokens. With this feature we can preserve the USD value of coin, this protects from market fluctuations so that small businesses will not hesitate to accept it.

As you say they have better insight than most and can use media to manipulate. We are all just pawns in this game

8478 2018-11-14 13:48:34 well, i am old skool. all the way back to run dmc/ll cool j (i am 44) but to me 90's NYC hip hop will always be king.

but i am a massive @therealelp fan and have been with Def Jux ish since it all came out. 

I think el will agree with me that 90's hip hop was amazing.

8480 2018-11-14 13:48:02 @APompliano I love your enthusiasm in all things crypto. In this case I think your observation is incorrect. IMF’s position here is to confound crypto space through deception. This is their version of “not Bitcoin but blockchain” nonsense.
8481 2018-11-14 13:48:02 last year it helped. This year non-factor. I wouldnt highlight the fund if it were all just one lucky crypto bet.
8482 2018-11-14 13:48:01 Yeah but that's how people start down the rabbit-hole though. Arguably, the plebs shouting nonsense on the internet are responsible for a large part of crypto's insane network effect reach over the last decade.

8485 2018-11-14 13:47:53 good good very good, nice
8486 2018-11-14 13:47:45 At this point crypto is just boring...still love it...but bears are just boring... 
8487 2018-11-14 13:47:43 I actually despised finance growing up. Mostly because I associates it with my accounting class, and thought that was what it was all about. If it wasn't for $BTC I probably would not have discovered how interesting the field actually is. Thanks Obama... I mean Bitcoin
8488 2018-11-14 13:47:43 1) The funny thing about those numbers is most reporters fail to compare the environmental footprint of crypto mining to anything at all. The better question might be what is the environmental impact of the way money is moved using traditional means, and which is worse?

8493 2018-11-14 13:47:12 One of the biggest problems in crypto is that people want free money easy, this means that the same people are easily scammed.
8494 2018-11-14 13:47:04 nice project

8538 2018-11-14 13:41:25 If you research blockchain technology you will understand that it cannot be manipulated.  It is the technology behind the creation of crypto coins but it is far more than that. The technology is being used by banks and the major credit card companies because of the safety factor.

8590 2018-11-14 13:35:49 I think the data is more isolated to Finex rather than an indicator for the whole market like it was in previous instances.

8626 2018-11-14 13:31:49 I think the research you've done is great, but the actions of the regulators speak greater. I have 0 faith in the ability of crypto to succeed in the US now. Which is frankly, depressing.
8627 2018-11-14 13:31:34 Nice one 
8628 2018-11-14 13:31:30 Of to reading then! Btw really appreciate your and the @TheBlock__ s work, a breath of fresh air in the crypto journalism departament.
8629 2018-11-14 13:31:25 Je suis impressionné qu'autant de gens se passionnent pour des sujets hors de leurs compétences. La finance, macro économie, la technologie, la Supply chain. Avec la #crypto on se rattrape sur une tonne de sujets. Même si on Moon pas. On a déjà gagner.
8630 2018-11-14 13:31:16 mercatox! a great exchange for a great project!
8631 2018-11-14 13:30:37 @WilliamShatner nice to see you in the crypto space.

8634 2018-11-14 13:30:16 @cosscrypto its a shame coss aint having much activities for their coins. I heard gatcoin is having a trading competition out there.

8737 2018-11-14 13:20:51 Agree for reference point but I mean the form of a candle.  In traditional markets traders trade on close or hopening moments and that specific candle gives you intel.

8744 2018-11-14 13:19:59 let’s face it. crypto bears own the market. they’ve easily kept it down all year. they could do it for 10yrs straight and not blink an eye. there are no crypto bulls. it’s all shorters.

8746 2018-11-14 13:19:46 Man! whenever I mention anything about crypto, all I ever hear is; bitcoin...its just a scam. If only people would wake up, smell the roses and realise the global financial system as it stands is corrupt and out to screw the average individual. Glad I'm in early

8749 2018-11-14 13:19:30 #Bitcoin is your private property, it's a denomination of how much value you have in a market set up to be permissionless under trustless verification, backed by an immutable blockchain. This way forward will cut down on theft by governments to pay for endless wars

8780 2018-11-14 13:16:39 Yeah, we all know who Satoshi really is..
8781 2018-11-14 13:16:21 "Satoshi" lol. This guy is a scammer.
8782 2018-11-14 13:16:11 Continuously printing the money is theft, creating money out of nowhere & charging interest is theft, therefore taxation is theft. Especially the part where they still tax regular people & ease the burden of major corps & the wealthy all that is theft.
8783 2018-11-14 13:16:10 Maybe they simply enjoy forking each other in the shitcoin hole?

8786 2018-11-14 13:16:01 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。

8826 2018-11-14 13:11:33 I think the current environment is a smoke screen. If the regulators get their way (and it looks like they will), then crypto really isn't needed or wanted. With full KYC/AML, regulator "protection" and etc, why bother using crypto? Just use fiat and databases.

8882 2018-11-14 13:05:04 When traditional markets crash people start panicking and liquidating all kinds of assets, including precious metals like silver and gold.

8885 2018-11-14 13:04:41 "This contract is a put on Bitcoin Cash ABC"
I think you are wrong on two counts.
1. It is a future not an option
2. The underlying of the BCHZ18 future is Bitcoin Cash ABC, so when you Long it you are Long BCHABC; you are effectively Short BCHSV.
8886 2018-11-14 13:04:38 Both have two opposing views.

Both are successful traders.

There is a deep lesson in there.
8887 2018-11-14 13:04:30 Most everyone who has been involved in crypto knows that there are many dead coins. They are called alt coins because they're not bitcoin. There's no trouble getting people to read a list that everyone knows about. Their demise has been predicted by bitcoin maximalists.

Bu sabır değil, s..gidin kriptodan diyorlar  Soya soya doymadılar. 5800$ altına inerse. 2000$ a kadar kripto piyasasından çıkarım.Kendileri kaybeder. Mining biter

8926 2018-11-14 13:01:17 Nice to see a bigger account putting out this truth. Most are afraid to lose followers by being too bearish. 

I thought we might be bottoming as of recent. I now think we have another wave down. Still too frothy.
8927 2018-11-14 13:01:15 It worked well on my last trades, I see here just some S/R flip on previous resistance at a higher time frame would have given me a perfect signal to buy on a small pullback. Pity I missed it. Probably wont play now as the 2014 high looks choppy. Happy trading :)
8928 2018-11-14 13:01:10 good morning crypto crew, we all started somewhere., I have a question...What was your first job and how much did you get paid. ??????? how old were you when you got your first job...
8929 2018-11-14 13:01:09 Many traders look at daily/weekly/monthly close but does it really make sense? 
Crypto is 24/7 and "daily close" is for traditional markets which really close for a certain time and traders act because of that closing candle and the shut down period.  
Just wondering.
8930 2018-11-14 13:01:04 by crypto trading floor do they mean zero?

8932 2018-11-14 13:01:03 Serious question: where is the most legitimate source of information on crypto I can educate myself with? I am truly interested, but have read some contradictory arguments(which is fine!) I just want educated properly. Thanks in advance (::)
8933 2018-11-14 13:00:53 3hrs later and still waiting on my BTC confirmation..... SO SLOW #btc #bitcoin #blockchain #crypto
8934 2018-11-14 13:00:52 Of course not. Crypto is about free choice and having options. It's all a big experiment and we're figuring out how it all works in practice, not just theory. So far we agree that users seem to have the upper hand, but it's about having a balanced system.

8939 2018-11-14 13:00:38 Tu pense que cet hardfork pourrait decridibiliser  le BCH (bien que je trouve cet crypto merdique)?
8940 2018-11-14 13:00:34 That's actually correct. Transferring a few million dollars without slippage is really hard using crypto. 
You may be able to transfer billions of dollars worth crypto but it's very difficult to convert it to local currency

8952 2018-11-14 12:59:26 Same. I actually tried to sell and buy back lower to increase my holding, it started going up instead, I lost some link, now I'm just holding!
8953 2018-11-14 12:59:23 This is why I think Apple will win: their dedication to privacy has made iOS the only, generally accessible, secure computing platform. In a crypto future of fake news and cloned Facebook profiles, a secure, cryptographically signed (prove-able) identity with bioID is valuable.

8962 2018-11-14 12:58:34 Did you see anyone call BCH dumping this hard before the fork?
8963 2018-11-14 12:58:19 The Bitcoin Cash upcoming fork, much like $BCH itself forking from Bitcoin $BTC, really shows that crypto has all the politics and people problems the 'normal' world has. "New paradigm" maybe, but same ol' people 
8964 2018-11-14 12:58:16 a warning to my students - today's class covers #Tokenlot, #Coburn/EtherDelta, #McDonnell, #Hinman's Speech, (&Clayton's response), the #NYDFS Virtual Currency Integrity Report, a few guest appearances by #crypto luminaries, & explain how the #SEC are clearly fans of @DUALIPA .
8965 2018-11-14 12:58:15 I haven’t kept up to date with the $BCH fork bonanza.

It’s such a shitcoin to me.

That’s like wondering if Craig is still giving Roger that dick.

No thanks 
8966 2018-11-14 12:58:09 Honestly surprised I’ve haven’t seen physical violence in crypto.
8967 2018-11-14 12:57:54 You're perfectly entitled to blindly follow whatever prophet you choose, based on credentials of a self-proclaimed single discipline that in no way transfers over to a very technical multi-disciplined paradigm such as crypto. Her math is provably nuts, but why should that matter?
8968 2018-11-14 12:57:42 I'm so pissed of cause of all the scam ICOs that come nowadays. God, bless guys that do projects that give me back a hope that cryptoindustry is a mankind future. Turn your attention to this #crypto #oppopenwifi @oppopenwifi

9003 2018-11-14 12:52:52 I haven't really had a bunch of time to look into it.  What I do see, is that it is trying to do the same thing that so many other coins are doing....it looks just like alot of other crypto websites... blockchain transactions blah blah blah....not sure what sets them apart.

9023 2018-11-14 12:51:13 “Cryptos” is way to broad of a category to be put next to Gold and Silver. The majority of Crypto’s are simply start up companies that are making no money. The Crypto’s that stand alone and have a decentralized nature are worthy to sit next to Gold and Silver.

IT just seems like stars are aligning for an upward trend now.
9119 2018-11-14 12:37:57 I'll hold my breath. Crypto in the US is dead. Even "anon" crypto, with the CFTC arguing for prosecution of developers.

9214 2018-11-14 12:24:00 hello guys
Have you ever seen the word bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the most valuable virtual currency in the world, with a current price of $ 6,400...
Now I'll introduce you the way to get free bitcoin

[ crypto tab ]
9215 2018-11-14 12:23:53 Today it's around .05 two yrs maybe $10 to $20 each . How much of a gain is that ? 
Now you've taking out a loan against the crypto you have in the app and it's time to start paying it back but instead of using fiat your using your CEL that you purchased @.05 but worth $20 then.

9352 2018-11-14 12:07:22 ETH is collateral. If price of ETH is high you get more DAI if low you get less. Collateral min I think is 150%. If 1 ETH=150$, than you can "print" max 100 Dai.

9473 2018-11-14 11:52:23 crypto-enabled extraterritoriality only makes sense in the original meaning of crypto.

Coin mining operations are still very accessible to the state with a thermal camera, and at the same time a hard sell to the general public.

This problem is not solved yet.

9510 2018-11-14 11:46:30 It's more of a vicious circle than that. For example there wasn't nearly any comparable Fad happening during 2010-2013, but money came into the crypto space. Fad started happening towards the end of 2013 and then the bubble popped. Similar stuff happened in the .com bubble too.

9555 2018-11-14 11:41:50 crypto-currency is a digital currency that is decentralized - there is no owner as bank or government; it is owned by the people. The advantage is zero fees and, in most cases, instant transactions from anywhere in the world. #SportsFix #TokenSale #gamechanger

9617 2018-11-14 11:34:48 It is difficult if you have cryptos that are very correlated with the price of Bitcoin. The best strategy is to buy projects that are cheaper than other similar projects (hopefully supply or even less). Like Cred, Pareto, Origintrail, Utrust, NKN, etc.

9627 2018-11-14 11:34:16 $btc goes down and people come out to troll those that were in longs. At least they had stop losses like good traders would. Can't say the same for 95% of crypto traders who don't know what they're doing half the time

9630 2018-11-14 11:33:55 The official account of @gsuite was hacked or "compromised" as Google describe it.

The hackers promoted a #Bitcoin Scam where they promised to share 10,000 units of $BTC to those who sent them 0.1 BTC first.

We in the $Crypto Community have an obligation to raise scam awareness

9650 2018-11-14 11:31:42 Maybe it won't collapse but it's pretty clear Tether is a shitty stablecoin and people don't trust it, which is totally fine.

9778 2018-11-14 11:14:19 Tips6：The Chinise name of TRON CEO Justin Sun is "孙宇晨（sūnyǔchén）". His family name, Sun, is rather pronounced "Suen" than "Sun."
豆知識⑥：TRONのCEOの本名は孙宇晨（sūnyǔchén）といいます。通称のJustinは英語名、苗字のSunは中国語で「すぇん」と読みます。

9780 2018-11-14 11:14:09 I'm convinced crypto is a woman at this point having a very long period.
9781 2018-11-14 11:14:08 Crypto feels  a bit like the „red wedding“ episode of GOT right now.
9782 2018-11-14 11:14:07 Maybe the IMF is signaling the cancellation of the worlds fiat debt with digital currencies? It doesn't matter though. The ppl want freedom and decentralization means freedom. The world governments need to recognize this and accept it. #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrencies

9789 2018-11-14 11:13:11 @haydentiff after seeing what happened to ZRX and BAT maybe it’s a blessing that @coinbase won’t list XRP. The hate of @Ripple just makes me want to accumulate more XRP
9790 2018-11-14 11:13:11 Vanuit dat perspectief zou de euro ook een goede oplossing zijn voor het scaling probleem

But oh well... it really depends which government and how strong they are...
China won't end up like this and they already have a solid blockchain/crypto plan to execute.

9832 2018-11-14 11:08:14 How will they take a financial hit? They’ll be getting the forked coin by holding BCH. I’m guessing if they want to crash SV they can dump heavy on the market with their stash. It will be an enjoyable ride no doubt

9887 2018-11-14 11:00:14 Market is confused about the fork. Bitmain is heavily involved in #BCH - owns 5% of the total supply - and this could have implications for the #crypto market overall.

9920 2018-11-14 10:56:35 Despite the good news in #crypto we're still in a bloodbath for 11 months, what a year to buy so many promising projects in the future with #xrp as the pack leader #xrp #strat #dcr #bat #lsk #waves
9921 2018-11-14 10:56:33 Is it realistic to ladder between 6000 and 6080 ?
9922 2018-11-14 10:56:32 And there’s the dump!
9923 2018-11-14 10:56:26 High-risk bets are becoming more similar in nature to lotteries/ luck-based gambling, turning away from the original nature of sports betting. #DESICO #DESI #Crypto
9924 2018-11-14 10:56:22 つい…
9925 2018-11-14 10:56:19 Just be careful to monitor the price at launch time. Could see a dump if the market conditions are healthy. Buy the rumour, sell the news. I'm in it for the long term with NEX though ;) @neonexchange

9927 2018-11-14 10:56:15 This is why #aXpire excites me:

> Current $24 billion dollar AUM hedge fund client.
> Worked with Intel, IBM, Nike, the NFL, and Coca-Cola.
> Family office partners, $8 trillion dollars AUM ++.
> $AXPR's burn function, decreasing token supply.

9951 2018-11-14 10:53:22 People who support crypto currency say its benefitsare no central bank or control to it. Do you subscribe to this or see any benifits Godfrey? Always value your opinion
9952 2018-11-14 10:53:17 thats how humay psychology works.. if i will say you check out @CashaaLtd now.. you won't but you will notice only when its too late to get on board #truth #bitcoin #blockchain #cashaa
9953 2018-11-14 10:53:11 If the market plummets, some of these projects will get under a heavy liquidity pressure. Then it’s super important to follow their activity on social media, channels, marketing, development and if they are delivering whats promised. At least you can get a few hints there.

9962 2018-11-14 10:51:49 So, $BCHSV is now trading at a higher price and has majority of the hash power. Is $BCHABC doomed?
What unexpected surprise could cause the most pain for the masses shorting BCH(ABC) on #Bitmex right now?
Baring this, could @rogerkver fade into obscurity?

9965 2018-11-14 10:50:58 A lot of $crypto coins seem to be preparing for the sell-off. VET is already dumping. Unfortenately for the holders, this is the point of maximum pain, where majority will probably sell.
