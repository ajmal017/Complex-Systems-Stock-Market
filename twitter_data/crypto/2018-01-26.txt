11 2018-01-27 23:59:08 VitalikButerin: But with full blocks, we don't have that luxury, and we see how txfee markets actually are quite volatile. For expenses that are not in-the-moment in nature, like filling storage, there's no reason why they should cost $0.01 on Tuesday and $3 on Friday.
12 2018-01-27 23:59:07 VitalikButerin: Before, I discounted this, because what were essentially political pressures (but which I didn't recognize as such at the time) were successfully keeping fees in the $0.01-0.1 range, lobbying miners' mingasprices down every time ETH (or BTC) went up.
13 2018-01-27 23:59:07 VitalikButerin: If ETH went up by 10x, that would make the system less affordable sure, but then *interest* in ethereum going up by 10x would make fees less affordable by a similar amount anway.

15 2018-01-27 23:59:06 VitalikButerin: For example, suppose that we claimed that the Ethereum state was "the world hard drive" with a maximum theoretical capacity of 120 terabytes (assume no sharding); you would need to lock up 0.001 ETH to fill up 1 KB of state (now ~$5 for a medium-sized contract).

85 2018-01-27 23:51:13 VitalikButerin: Things we learned in 2017: in the full-blocks equilibrium, transaction fee prices are even more volatile than cryptocurrency prices. This suggests that for costs incurred over time rather than immediately (eg. storage space), setting a fixed fee may actually …

100 2018-01-27 23:50:02 If #TRX #tron becomes $5 this is what is it would mean mathematically. It would have a market cap of close to $320 Billion which is worth slightly more than 57% of the entire Crypto market cap as a whole. $320 Billion is approximately the total of the top 10 currencies combined.

105 2018-01-27 23:49:32 Yes at $12.34 and then it exploded. $LUN is going to get back to $50+ soon enough. They have they Beta happening very soon.
106 2018-01-27 23:49:31 Those small caps should take off later on this year and be next in line for big take off. At least, that what they predict since the futures. Smart money will be keep shaking crypto tree until the last coin falls off ..

121 2018-01-27 23:47:31 I reckon by the time the theft was noticed, they had transferred it to other currencies and then transferred again. Crypto currency is preference of dark net cause it easy to launder and had to trace.
122 2018-01-27 23:47:23 Yeah market will go to shit if/when it happens, but you can't say you didn't warn everyone 
123 2018-01-27 23:47:20 I don't see a problem here. All stocks & crypto are succeptible to fuquery. If your coin or stock is chosen, sell high & buy back low. If you fomo over a tweet, you're to blame. #DYOR
124 2018-01-27 23:47:10 Not sure whether I block all these crypto spammer bots because I think it will actually help, or if it's just because I can stop to read their ridiculous bios during the process. #cryptocurrency

153 2018-01-27 23:43:30 If USDT dissolves, fiat would be the safest most likely? I think crypto would tank across the board.

155 2018-01-27 23:43:13 Vinnie Lingham is the new David Seaman indicator
156 2018-01-27 23:42:52 Love this description of Bitcoin on The Screen Savers show on @TWiT 
Bitcoin is a crypto stock, not a currency. Much high fluctuations. 
@leolaporte
157 2018-01-27 23:42:38 Exciting news coming from @justinsuntron and the #TRX project! Don’t expect #Tron to instantly moon but gain confidence knowing this #crypto is accomplishing strong feats. I can’t wait to see how #GTO will fit into this equation as well. #Gifto
158 2018-01-27 23:42:37 Can’t wait to see all these robo-advisors and trading platforms start offering low-fee crypto trading. #livetoseetheday
159 2018-01-27 23:42:33 I only want Bitdong. I'm very into crypto.
160 2018-01-27 23:42:25 Trx
161 2018-01-27 23:42:22 Maybe if they shifted from Fiat to crypto as well more would fly and they would actually have a bigger budget to fix things to pamper the passengers like they should. Oh wait..forgot..they don't care.
162 2018-01-27 23:42:17 LOL, looks like someone missed out on the one sat price. Sad!
163 2018-01-27 23:42:08 Let's hope the new month starts better for the crypto market. It's been really tyring wathing the ....dead pool. Also let's hope XRP is moving up!! I mean come on a lott of positive news came out
164 2018-01-27 23:42:02 And $trx Tron also a major scam token.
165 2018-01-27 23:41:58 Tron will 100% hit $0.30 in February or March  #TRX #TRON #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoinnews #etherium #Bitcoin #cryptocurrencynews @davidgokhshtein @CryptoCriedWolf

168 2018-01-27 23:41:46 Plz one more pump
169 2018-01-27 23:41:42 @Haejin_Crypto is the truth
170 2018-01-27 23:41:42 ヤフー掲示板だともっと酷いです。
171 2018-01-27 23:41:40 tfw someone replies to you and gets 5 retweets within 3 seconds of posting.

Check their profile and it's a 2 month old account but they've "been in crypto for years". Only 1-2 people I follow follow them.

Definitely 100% legit... Be careful who you're following/listening to.
172 2018-01-27 23:41:36 You're correct. I was aware the App had a Crypto buying option, but I wasn't aware that it was just a Buy option.  They do not have the facility to transfer the bought Crypto anywhere.   So, it's not great for Crypto so far.  I hope they improve it, as I like the App itself.
173 2018-01-27 23:41:25 It’s very well know that this will happen if you leave your coins on an online exchange just like history repeats itself in the stock market and housing markets, it does so with crypto too, that’s why it’s critical to learn from past mistakes and keep your coins offline
174 2018-01-27 23:41:15 Bitcoin wastes too much energy to be a crypto-currency. The sooner #bitcoin fails the sooner we can move to future viable currencies
175 2018-01-27 23:41:12 I'm interested!
176 2018-01-27 23:40:56 I now have a large hate for crypto currency miners...
177 2018-01-27 23:40:55 強制利確からの18年度は税金発生ですかね。でも対応の速さには感心しています。
178 2018-01-27 23:40:51 All because of people mining crypto currency lmao. No idea when it will deflate. But yeah they are OD pricey.

182 2018-01-27 23:40:12 Fantastic list. Thank you!
183 2018-01-27 23:40:09 These women overs are worth taking a break from crypto!
184 2018-01-27 23:40:07 Blockchain, crypto and Offshore? Any synergies tapping into those industries?

188 2018-01-27 23:39:32 I read your tweets now a while and you gave my days allways often a hallarius start.
I have an idea since my first day of a hardcore neerd and cast out. the the transcended hardware and isp fees was the limit. By the way, no internet at all (1991) but was neither a problem  (t1)

191 2018-01-27 23:39:20 I have heard some people say government bonds as they are very stable and balances the high risk of crypto
192 2018-01-27 23:39:17 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。
193 2018-01-27 23:39:12 3 big reasons for a Jackpot 2018:

2) Best investments aren't yielding

3) Bitcoin is the v disruptive Global currency after USD & Euro

194 2018-01-27 23:39:02 Look at VEN that you're holding. I'm sure you didn't know that it was going to drop all the way down to 0.006 btc today.
195 2018-01-27 23:39:02 Haven't read Man in the High Castle, is that another recommendation?

Re "It doesn't", not sure whether you're saying it "doesn't portray both sides as monsters" or "it does portray both sides as monsters"
196 2018-01-27 23:38:59 ???
197 2018-01-27 23:38:54 Amen! Crypto currency doesn't sit well with me. Regulation should be required. I think will see new alternatives; believe or not w BB leading the way in this tech. :)
198 2018-01-27 23:38:44 I started off in this living paycheck-to- paycheck, and nothing sitting in savings. Knowledge and understanding of crypto and fundamentals of projects always helps for making a sound investment in such a volatile space.
199 2018-01-27 23:38:44 Valuable technical analysis on $Aion coming up soon! Who's pumped?

200 2018-01-27 23:38:44 One of the main points (drawing points for me) is its potential to be decentralized, I have no desire to trade one central bank for another. I could throw a couple others in there with Bcash too.
201 2018-01-27 23:38:35 Thanks for such a solid explanation once more bro! Ur my kinda crypto dude - been reading your TL & its deffo my vibe! Will keep an eye! Check out $INT btw that's my recent tip 
202 2018-01-27 23:38:19 Almost at a 24 hour low on very low vol for $XLM. WAIT FOR THE BOUNCE! Too much going on with this one for it to continue the down trend.

206 2018-01-27 23:37:14 @AwesomeMinerApp I downloaded your free app and noticed it only reports PCB temps, and not chip temps. PCB temps are not critical like chip temps. Can this report chip temps and autoshutdown after 85?

208 2018-01-27 23:36:52 Crypto currency is of the devil
209 2018-01-27 23:36:52 It will suck in a newbie or two, then roger might scare them away too.
210 2018-01-27 23:36:44 1 Million Transactions Per Second. Say it with me...1 Million TPS...yes, this team has the very best and the brightest, building a monster platform that's designed to SMOKE the competition.
211 2018-01-27 23:36:43 Do you have crypto exposure ? Or are you completely out bc you realize the liquidity effect $USDT collapse will have on exchanges ?
212 2018-01-27 23:36:42 The markets is getting bored of it, bigger blocks aren't a selling point when all the cool innovation is on $BTC. LN is gaining a lot of traction and were only in January! Fees are dropping by the day and Roger is still FUDing. He's looking desperate.
213 2018-01-27 23:36:18 Team seems solid, Telegram also very active, fresh idea and they've been giving some sneak peeks of their platform so it looks like they have an actual product being worked on. Considering some invest in projects w/o a whitepaper, I think it looks promising.
214 2018-01-27 23:36:14 I see alot of people doing the typical human act of mob mentality when it comes to crypto they see FUD about a certain coin on twitter and grab there pitchforks. Heres an idea research the technology and make your own mind up.

217 2018-01-27 23:35:42 You should notice, my last two additions:  $ADA and $VEN were added because they are positioned to whether the storm that will sweep away many of these #crypto currency's.  Among other reasons, but I wanted to highlight that!

225 2018-01-27 23:34:42 how could this destroy the crypto market?
226 2018-01-27 23:34:41 Please pick my broke ass 19Ncrh5dyZiEgkGqoTLSiUxT6g8GFPYBLK
227 2018-01-27 23:34:36 Wow! You are so funny! You would probably be better in comedy with that lame response than anything to do with crypto! Like I said, go sit down!
228 2018-01-27 23:34:33 I still have not made my mind but I tend to lean into this direction too.
229 2018-01-27 23:34:28 Be a good month if we get the #BCC #USDT #XRP and #BCASH scam coins all to unwind in January.  Would be super bullish for crypto as a whole.  Get rid of the scam coins would be a bullish event.
230 2018-01-27 23:34:26 1/3にGMOからcoinExchangeに送って届いてない0.5ETHのサポートの状況見たら、処理中になってた。春ごろに高騰してそうだからそのころに解決されると良いな。

232 2018-01-27 23:34:13 Dude it’s literally the same thing from Big Short. Brad Pitt’s character summed it up best
233 2018-01-27 23:34:10 No, u can't time it perfect to know the exact highest price to sell or the exact lowest price to buy.
234 2018-01-27 23:34:00 Moon? There you go again, hyping the hell out of something that is so insignificant. There are 1.3 billion people in India and about 1,000-2,000 are into crypto. This is like you open shops to sell bacon in the Middle East. And your 10000000000000 prediction was unethical.
235 2018-01-27 23:33:52 How much to invest in crypto: 

A percentage of your wealth that is equivalent to your understanding of how the technology works and your ability to absorb the risk it entails.
236 2018-01-27 23:33:51 Just messing with ya, good catch on Friedman!
237 2018-01-27 23:33:45 You mean the slimy, smarmy, ever-so-grateful-he-is-gone Wm. Buckley, of course--or as, Gore Vidal so perfectly called him, the "crypto-nazi."
238 2018-01-27 23:33:38 I pinned it on my Twitter
239 2018-01-27 23:33:32 What’s b-cash..? Is that like a shitty dogecoin?
240 2018-01-27 23:33:28 And almost at that point where Bitcoin Private will be respected.
241 2018-01-27 23:33:20 Y’all need to check out @raiblocks it’s an instant and feeless crypto.
242 2018-01-27 23:33:19 That's some good stuff! How is crypto currency supposed to bring good? I like investing in companies that will change the world. Thanks for sharing Jean.
243 2018-01-27 23:33:14 損失額が多い人は納得いかないだろうね。僕は大した額じゃないから返金無くても諦めてたから、返金あるだけ良かったし、返金という判断したコインチェックを応援します〜
244 2018-01-27 23:33:14 おっしゃる通りです。おそらく経験があったのでよくご存知だったんでしょうね(笑)
245 2018-01-27 23:33:14 $MAN is going to crush it. Best buy in the market right now, self adapting AI, no forks needed, because as technology changes, this project will self evolve, so it will never be less competitive, & it's utility design is for the masses of asses who are consumers not programmers.
246 2018-01-27 23:33:13 Or play with #crypto
247 2018-01-27 23:33:12 Should have said cryptocurrency because crypto is somthing else. you are correct to lol
248 2018-01-27 23:33:07 I was really hoping that Jihan and Rog would kick BTC while it was down from futures by pumping BCH... that didn't happen and now I have this turd crypto making a mess of my portfolio.
249 2018-01-27 23:33:03 I just like chicken nuggets a bit too much!
250 2018-01-27 23:33:00 It doesn't always work that way in crypto.
251 2018-01-27 23:32:54 Pretty much anything else  the crypto realm is a better project than bitconnect.
252 2018-01-27 23:32:50 Get some tron! You will not regret it! I am seeing 2k a coin in a month? #tron #trx $trx #crypto #bitcoin $btc
253 2018-01-27 23:32:41 Its really amazing
254 2018-01-27 23:32:27 290million is circulating supply. Just been released from ICO so guess it will update soon..
255 2018-01-27 23:32:15 Best crypto to invest in this year is .........
256 2018-01-27 23:32:10 There are no issues - nobody forbids women to interact with crypto. Remember: you and only you yourself are responsible for your actions - not men/patriarchy/[put your random “offensive institution”].
257 2018-01-27 23:31:59 
258 2018-01-27 23:31:55 I'm just sort of waiting for growth and using my time wisely rather than watching a boring barely moving market.
259 2018-01-27 23:31:38 えええええええ！
260 2018-01-27 23:31:38 Considering it has yet to be listed on any big exchanges, yea, I would say now is a great time to get in. It was 2nd place on  Binance's community coin last month and I can't think of any real competition for this months CC listing vote. Gonna go through the roof.
261 2018-01-27 23:31:33 Digibyte is the best choice as a crypto payment method !! Fast , cheap fees and safe !! What do you  waithing for ..Digibyte is the future !
262 2018-01-27 23:31:33 そうですよね、選べるのがベストなんですが、ちょっと腑に落ちない人も多いのかなと感じてしまいます。
利確では無く保証金扱いなのでは？という声もありますが、どうなるのか
263 2018-01-27 23:31:31 Are we? I've seen many people still saying to stock up on it.  I think it's a joke but not sure about the rest of the  #cryptocurrency peeps
264 2018-01-27 23:31:29 East, or easy?? PC or Mac? We have and use both, so either/or cuts it. I can probably build a more powerful PC for the same price, but the price of video cards has shot up due to crypto-currency miners.
265 2018-01-27 23:31:28 No! Only $bcc! Fuck those other coins; I'm steadfastly sticking to coin that has been proven to be, without a doubt, a scam!

272 2018-01-27 23:30:47 Taking someone's advice and muting the words "blockchain", "crypto" , and  "cryptocurrency". Let's see how this works out.
273 2018-01-27 23:30:45 You are more confused than a nun doing squats in a cucumber farm.
274 2018-01-27 23:30:43 @crypto_bobby @VinnyLingham
275 2018-01-27 23:30:36 Was more looking fore announcements of partnerships, updates on wallets/apps, etc that would show company growth and development.  But nothing.  Usually i cut a loss at 40%, currently sitting at 37% with ripple based on last buy in.  Time to move on.
276 2018-01-27 23:30:30 My man!!!!

279 2018-01-27 23:30:04 If you ever hear the words pump and HODL out of anyone's mouth avoid that shit like the plague $crypto $btc if you can't understand that have fun getting dumped on
280 2018-01-27 23:30:01 Once you get all your crypto stolen, FDIC insurance at your bank doesn’t sound so stupid does it? $BTC $ETH
281 2018-01-27 23:29:58 The question wasn't about the volatilty of Litecoin. If you dont believe that Litecoin will surpass the $200 mark by the end of the year, thats you. So, yes, why dont you sell me your litecoin for $200 later this year. Have a seat!
282 2018-01-27 23:29:55 Dude I just can tell you if you want to go on Crypto and HODL you just need to have even 10$ of #BTC and follow people like @DougPolkPoker who are true people, I really hope all will go back good for you, but if you're US just go to authorities about Trevon James to get justice
283 2018-01-27 23:29:53 Do not sell a token. The price can grow up to 3 $
284 2018-01-27 23:29:38 Why no market cap?
285 2018-01-27 23:29:32 I hope your right Archer, it’s almost time for a turn, want to pick up $50k of Litecoin, just been waiting for a bottom, we’ve all had a string of bad news so crypto has def been volatile at mo!

291 2018-01-27 23:28:57 Bitpay was my first selection but at the moment they are trying to finish  the migration process of allowing us to use other crypto that's not #BTC to get started. #BTC takes to long and cost too much for me to send it. But thanks for the input.

301 2018-01-27 23:27:34 I do not see why not. First cyphercon Steve, Dave and I drank and completed the crypto challeneges.

303 2018-01-27 23:27:23 Icx, ven, neo, lisk, OMG, Eos, ark, kmd.. and let's be honest, IOTA will be the next bitcoin if it works. Everyone must own some iota, it's definitely the biggest gamble, but if it works will come with the biggest reward.
304 2018-01-27 23:27:15 Someone needs to take the trash out!!!!
305 2018-01-27 23:27:08 DVD！！

308 2018-01-27 23:26:42 for me ethereum in crypto is like android in mobiles. There are others mobile OS, like tizen from Samsung, Firefox OS, Ubuntu OS, Windows mobile, but android is the king. Rest only disappear . In crypto, when someone wants to do one ico, they use ERC-20 token.
309 2018-01-27 23:26:38 Check out TRAC 
310 2018-01-27 23:26:14 what is your crypto portfolio lookin like?  you gonna be richer than your brother soon
311 2018-01-27 23:26:09 Be cool if @Joeingram1 showed up though. Tell him you got a lead on a new crypto???
312 2018-01-27 23:26:04 I’ve heard for a more than a few people “in the know” that think Tron $TRX is not much more than a pump and dump with good marketing and a big name in Justin Sun...thoughts?
313 2018-01-27 23:26:02 you'll find that there is no reasoning behind such comments.
314 2018-01-27 23:26:00 if you can about crypto! then you should  to know about @electroneum petantial !? read a little bit and listen to Mr. Richarld Ells so you will understand what is #ETN! good luck!
315 2018-01-27 23:25:32 @creativeeng do you offer crypto trade coaching?
316 2018-01-27 23:25:28 フォロー開始！
317 2018-01-27 23:25:27 まあそんな金は補填できないから時間稼ぎでしかないんだけどねw
318 2018-01-27 23:25:11 Mr.@Eric_Gu you have lots of connections in the crypto space, why don't you use them to list Metaverse (ETP) on @binance_2017, @OKEx_  or even @Huobi_Pro? Thanks for your eventual response.
319 2018-01-27 23:25:10 期日が決まってない、他の通貨の出金制限が解けてないから予断を許さないっていうのは真だと思うけどな
320 2018-01-27 23:25:09 Who broke up with whom
321 2018-01-27 23:25:04 Fijn @johncrombez, ik zou willen weten wat dhr. De Leeuw, alias notionele Rudy, gaat vangen aan pensioen. En welke bijverdiensten heeft deze crypto-socialist nog? @sp_a
322 2018-01-27 23:24:57 こんなことあるの？ここ2,3日でなんか凄いことになってる。もう今年はお腹いっぱいだわ。
323 2018-01-27 23:24:55 i ubnno what?
324 2018-01-27 23:24:55 What should be done about crypto regulation is “looking at it” first, according to both the US and UK officials
325 2018-01-27 23:24:47 Lol I knew it hahahha
326 2018-01-27 23:24:45 What time does the stream start my man? Can't find it
327 2018-01-27 23:24:44 That's a good criticism. I should have added that victims were too greedy.

At the same time, did you watch the 3 videos in the section "Bitconnect victims" of the article? I can't really blame them. They are just simple trustful people who are not that crypto savvy, aren't they?
328 2018-01-27 23:24:28 Been holding since October.
329 2018-01-27 23:24:14 How did you buy your crypto currency? Did you use a bank account?
330 2018-01-27 23:24:03 選べると良いですよね。
返還期間は短いが円で返すのと、期間は長くなるがXEMで戻ってくる。
確かにガチホの人は期間が長くてもいいからXEMで返してほしそう。
でも数百億円XEM買うって宣言したとしたら私も全力で買いそうｗ
331 2018-01-27 23:24:01 Obvious answer is litecoin lmfao.....yeah because extreme volatility is healthy.
332 2018-01-27 23:24:01 Good article
333 2018-01-27 23:23:53 will land like a bomb ;)
334 2018-01-27 23:23:50 Hi Steven, how come?  Sounds decent to me?
335 2018-01-27 23:23:09 @LuxCrypto interested to know how much of your time you dedicate to crypto seen as you have plenty of other shizz going on? Also congrats on 10k in advance 
336 2018-01-27 23:23:01 Super
337 2018-01-27 23:22:56 Crypterium has stolen my token and are refusing to give them to me unless I buy more tokens why would I give them more money when they haven’t even held up their end of the deal  they want people to store crypto in their bank yet they are already scamming beware of this company
338 2018-01-27 23:22:51 Is there any startups trying to do a multi-Crypto paperwallet project for the alt-coins?

351 2018-01-27 23:21:44 IOT Chain $ITC was just given the Blockchain Excellence award at Davos World Economic Forum. The Davos economic forum is a major event attended by world leaders including the US president. I believe this project is criminally undervalued. #iotchain #Crypto #cryptocurrency

354 2018-01-27 23:21:23 @aelfblockchain Where can I read the whitepaper?
355 2018-01-27 23:21:12 @aelfblockchain Do you guys ever respond?
356 2018-01-27 23:21:10 Fingers crossed for a strong level by the end of Feb, and a trillion dollar market cap before June.
357 2018-01-27 23:21:07 They’re so far behind crypto I wouldn’t even worry
358 2018-01-27 23:21:05 @AwesomeMinerApp Can I use your app to auto-shutdown individual miners if overheating? Like.. "If temp > 85 then shutdown" I'm scared to leave my house with my A3 running cause it has no shutdown..
359 2018-01-27 23:21:05 なんだったか。5月にリップルの高騰予想した人工知能のやつ。
360 2018-01-27 23:20:53 今アメリカ保守の間では「秘密結社」が壮大にやり玉に上がっている。
しかもそれは「ピューリタン革命」まで遡って裏の歴史を探るという作業に発展…
表向きはプロテスタントやカトリックの「クリスチャン」でも「crypto jew」が多いと言う隠された実態の暴露が始まっています。
一度お調べ下さい。

363 2018-01-27 23:20:17 @UtopyaTech what if  Utopya phones actually incorporated a self contained hardware crypto wallet (like Trezor) and an app that allowed people to pay each other person-to-person,  no centralized regulated exchanges, no way for third world governments to even track it. ??
364 2018-01-27 23:20:12 let me know bro...i will tell you as soon as i know as well
365 2018-01-27 23:20:11 Atiq why don't you grow up and learn to be more tolerant and welcoming of people regardless of where they are from?? Your pathetic and I guarantee you will have zero success in crypto with that mindset.
366 2018-01-27 23:20:03 Being an Australian myself, this comes as no surprise. Sentiment and narrative from the gov’t has been positive regarding crypto. They view it as an opportunity to enhance their global presence. Why resist the inevitable when you can embrace it
367 2018-01-27 23:19:50 1000XEM利確されるってことか
18円だったからこの枚数買えてた訳で…お金無いからもう買えない笑
368 2018-01-27 23:19:43 I approved this meesage.
369 2018-01-27 23:19:41 I would agree with you.  There was a ripple conference yesterday, value still went  down.  It’s one of the few coins still going down after the crash earlier this month, yes still has lots of volume. Small investments with more money leaving.  Been debating to cut out at a loss..
370 2018-01-27 23:19:29 favorite crypto use case is paying my bills haha
371 2018-01-27 23:19:26 おはようございます(´･ω･`)(´-ω-`)) ﾍﾟｺﾘ

追加のところにKUCOINのOCNが記載されておりますが、反映されてない様に思われます(たぶん…)

373 2018-01-27 23:19:09 @DarrylVGreen1 what if  Utopya phones actually incorporated a self contained hardware crypto wallet (like Trezor) and an app that allowed people to pay each other person-to-person,  no centralized regulated exchanges, no way for third world governments to even track it.
374 2018-01-27 23:19:07 Haha if you say so. Maybe check out a project like EOS... I think you might find a little more depth than simply a blockchain.

Also, to be clear, I feel 95% of the crypto out there have great potential of losing a lot of value while the other 5% will soar and tap every market
375 2018-01-27 23:19:05 That traditional trader guy that doesn't like crypto called this a head and shoulders a day or so ago... Tether is the only thing holding the market up atm. 

...When is America going to get on the whole "counterfeiting" thing exactly?

380 2018-01-27 23:18:38 If you follow Matt and actually think he’s providing good info you need to completely reevaluate your strategy in this space. He’s a proven fraud that’s been in crypto for 2 months and has not the slightest clue what he’s doing. He also partipates/organizes pump and dumps #fraud

383 2018-01-27 23:18:17 Get your university involved . I am starting a crypto org at my HBCU this semester that helps with explaining it to others as well as investment strategies .
384 2018-01-27 23:18:06 yup, that's partialy correct (my personal opinion). personally, i'm doing price averaging when purchasing crypto coins that I believe. let's just use money that we can afford to lose
385 2018-01-27 23:17:49 コインチェックにいる税理士とかが優秀なのでは？相当お金払ってるだろうし、優秀そう
386 2018-01-27 23:17:37 take responsibility for whatever you do in the crypto space, and life in general. don’t expect others to dance with your tune. that’s called maturity. it’s more priceless than the quick profit that you seek in this thread.
387 2018-01-27 23:17:34 If you think it's too late to get in on crypto currencies and you don't have the funds to invest anyhow, click my links! Free mining, gambling, and compound interest!
388 2018-01-27 23:17:27 what's the tax rate on a crypto-crypyto trade? Not clear and haven't seen IRS guidance
389 2018-01-27 23:17:21 It's amazing. People are scrambling the put "#blockchain enthusiast" next to their name on their #ICO #whitepaper.  Who here have 5+ years blockchain or 20+ years #fintech experience?  Like writing 10 yrs #DataScientist exp 5 years ago...#BraveNewWorld #Crypto

399 2018-01-27 23:16:19 Buying any crypto from an "ATM" is stupid. The fees are absurd. However, if there's a way to pay for an item or cash out your crypto there it makes sense. Haven't seen data on trying to use it in the latter sense
400 2018-01-27 23:16:03 ってか、NEMがすごい！

410 2018-01-27 23:15:10 Still trying to figure out how people support both XRP and BCH...seem like very opposite ends of the crypto spectrum to me.  Almost like having one foot in the space and one foot out?!? Am I missing something???

421 2018-01-27 23:13:53 もう、今年はエキサイティングすぎる、いろんな意味で。
422 2018-01-27 23:13:51 And wouldn't it be nice if we can time it perfect but we can't. Hence, we lose, we win if u trade.

433 2018-01-27 23:12:54 Ironically he could say the same thing about you except you only seem to talk negatively about TRX. At least he’s promoting something he’s invested in and believes in. You’re just wasting your time bashing something for the sake of causIng FUD.
434 2018-01-27 23:12:38 Absolutely.  If the information is accurate and includes approaches to reduce taxes.  I'm sure there are loopholes.
435 2018-01-27 23:12:18 That's whales playing. It's back up now.
436 2018-01-27 23:12:06 Ripple has already planned for regulation from the onset so I would say if any crypto/token is prepared to weather that storm, there's no better than xrp.

438 2018-01-27 23:12:00 It is the centralized nature of ALT’s what will protect them (as governments know who’s door to knock at night). Any acces provider to Crypto (exchanges) that does not conform to global regulations and to AML and ATF will be persecuted by governments and closed down as criminals.

444 2018-01-27 23:11:33 Getting caught up on Hawaii Five-O and noticed a patch for crypto currency.  Anybody else catch it?
445 2018-01-27 23:11:31 Check out @laurashin Unchained podcast from 1/23. Interview with a tax lawyer and CPA that have extensive crypto knowledge.
446 2018-01-27 23:11:26 Why don't we give @stacyherbert a helping hand and report both the hack and the matter of Karl to the authorities. She seems quite busy travelling around the world and exposing fraud and talking about crypto. We might be making things easier...  #Startjoin
447 2018-01-27 23:11:25 News like this enforces the use case for cryptos. I don't think this is like the VR days of of the 90s. Crypto will prevail on its first run. We have the hardware. We have the blockchain. Lets go.

コインチェック良かったなぁー！
1番悪いシナリオしか想像できなかったけど、思っていた以上にコインチェックの資金力が強かったということだなぁ。
しかし、強制利確からの税金問題は気になる。
451 2018-01-27 23:11:15 I'll send a small donation in the morning. I'll also happily donate 5 or 10% of profits to you every time a tip pays off. I'm a crypto newbie so your input is appreciated!
452 2018-01-27 23:11:03 Which type of digital Wallet do you prefer?
453 2018-01-27 23:11:02 You guys better get your pricing right! We all moving to robinhood for this rip off. Not only the fees, the actual prices of crypto, we aren’t dumb.
454 2018-01-27 23:10:51 Half a billion dollars stolen by hackers from a crypto currency despite the use of block chains should be a rather big problem for other crypto currencies that use block chains you would think.
455 2018-01-27 23:10:40 I would happily take 0.20!  I think it will take time to continue up past that, but who knows!
456 2018-01-27 23:10:40 I would! Hoping you could look at projects like @thekeyvip @APEXnetworkCPX @QlinkMobi 2018 is the year of $NEO
457 2018-01-27 23:10:37 And when is it going to hit other exchanges?
458 2018-01-27 23:10:27 You guys better get your pricing right! We all moving to robinhood for this rip off. Not only the fees, the actual prices of crypto, we aren’t dumb.
459 2018-01-27 23:10:22 Of course. And this guy sees himself as some sort of crypto hedge fund expert but has no idea how wiping an absolutely huge amount of liquidity of the face of the earth will affect this market. Sad.

463 2018-01-27 23:09:26 Robinhood now has crypto trading, whos interested?
464 2018-01-27 23:09:20 Nice!
465 2018-01-27 23:09:01 I really want you guys to start partnering up with some American names. This would REALLY jump start this crypto. Visa/Snapchat/Steam etc!!!
466 2018-01-27 23:08:51 But you’re only mad that you sold early.  Now that someone invested in crypto tells the world, we can believe them. /s
467 2018-01-27 23:08:44 How this is a partnership? You just invested in them!?
468 2018-01-27 23:08:12 I think it’s successful because people keep hoping they might get lucky enough to catch sight of some balls

487 2018-01-27 23:06:33 dear every crypto pump group, please pump $INS. I tried to ride that initial binance wave and am dying a slow and painful death. love, your friend and epically terrible daytrader alex

489 2018-01-27 23:05:48 How is that even a solution?

Why do they THINK that is a solution? No, that is not a solution, the crypto miners will STILL buy them for that price, and gamers will not.

AKA they are jewing on the crypto miners knowing they will spend the dosh for their "investment".
490 2018-01-27 23:05:31 I genuinely feel like the crypto wave is over and its no longer "get rich" profitable unless your hosting the servers or creating the currency
491 2018-01-27 23:05:29 @Crypto_Brahma WHAT IS YOUR TARGET PRICE FOR $TRAC?

497 2018-01-27 23:04:59 You know what really annoys me right now?

That retailers are being forced to raise their prices to keep crypto miners from buying all their cards.

501 2018-01-27 23:04:27 Governance is not talked about enough in the crypto space. Fiat does not mean bills and coins, it means a currency that is backed by the faith of its users. Without thoughtful governance, we have every ability to repeat the sins of the past ~ blockchain or not.
502 2018-01-27 23:04:26 It would make privacy in all crypto a reality, without having to jump through hoops such as moving coins after exchanging or using a mixer. It would be huge and could launch any involved coins to the moon.

514 2018-01-27 23:03:58 The Ripple wallet itself is brilliant and very easy to use, compared to other crypto wallets. I try to avoid exchanges asking me for my passport. All depends what you want to do in that crypto space.
515 2018-01-27 23:03:52 Reading the #US government has programs that specifically track #Bitcoin payments, literally a waste of money imo

If you look up stats of Legit Crypto Usage vs Illicit Crypto Usage today its like 99% to 1%  ... spend money on #ICO regulation in the US, to prevent possible scams
516 2018-01-27 23:03:32 Extremely Delusional. The amount of liquidity that $USDT provides is tremendous. Can’t simply replace without feeling the effect

522 2018-01-27 23:02:43 Bitcoin has been taking a beating in January, not just in terms of value but also tech-wise.  If it never goes back to Dec 2017 levels will be interesting to see what happens. Could Ethereum become the new “USD” for the crypto world?
523 2018-01-27 23:02:41 Man,  wish I knew wtf y'all are talking about
524 2018-01-27 23:02:41 ハッカーは、既にマーキングされていて、動けない状態。もし少額を強制的にユーザーへばら撒き、その送りつけられた人は何で？って取引所へクレームが殺到して仕方なく取引できるようにする事でそこにハッカーも紛れて結局ハッカーのものになってしまう可能性があり只今監視され中。かなり勉強になる。

530 2018-01-27 23:02:00 A big turning point for me In $Crypto was when I actually wanted to find my own coins, doing my own thorough research and making my own decisions, rather than following Crypto Twitter and then doing a bit of research. 

You become much more knowledgeable about the space this way.

583 2018-01-27 22:54:42 just good parents :).The problem in crypto is that the big rises have seen people expect every project to boom, they need to do is read the team's roadmap and see that they follow it. I am sorry you were offended as you have an Indian brother, I dont think he meant it honestly.

622 2018-01-27 22:49:42 To run a node you have to be "trusted" which takes away one of the tenants of crypto which is trustless. Also, it has a central issuer. From a philosophical standpoint, bitcoin was made to fight against the banks, ripple serves the banks.
623 2018-01-27 22:49:32 Wrong... crypto is much more real than you guys think...just ask my landlord
624 2018-01-27 22:49:30 I bet Gold Bitches is really happy with all those gold price appreciation returns since 2009. man those crypto guys are suckers.
625 2018-01-27 22:49:30 Can we come together as #ICO Lending platforms community to stand up against scams in this industry?
626 2018-01-27 22:49:28 Crypto currency is a future, it’s meant to stay, but not meant to replace Fiat money.

Actual is still great than Virtual.

Put this into perspective:
Handwritten mail still appeals than Email.

646 2018-01-27 22:46:27 There's a #branding play here to allow #cryptocurrencies to coexist with #government currencies.

649 2018-01-27 22:46:20 Welcome to crypto land everything is new and how about a thanks Bittrex for helping get a revolutionary Blockchain tech integrated with their systems. Lots of coins want on Bittrex. Gratitude to Bittrex for their efforts 
650 2018-01-27 22:46:16 I mean mixing Orbit, The Phanatic and Shrek in to a mascot is a pretty bold move. We will have to see if that pays off for them.

655 2018-01-27 22:45:44 @VentureCoinist - Yo dude, have you studied the application of sentiment indicators for crypto? Keen to understand more about it if you have.
656 2018-01-27 22:45:30 Further addendum: I know this bc I'm working in the field of scientific computing/performance engineering and the amount of computing power that's being wasted for this crypto-shit instead of, e.g. drug design/science is extremely aggravating.
657 2018-01-27 22:45:16 @Starbucksnews I like ur company but seriously, don’t talk about something u clearly do not know about. Crypto is more than blockchain. If u want to be on front line, need to look into lightening network
658 2018-01-27 22:44:53 Tether is a USD token that people sell their BTC, ETH, etc for when they think coin prices will go down. So if there's no Tether. people have to leave their money in coins or cash all the way out.
659 2018-01-27 22:44:50 It’s funny we were thinking about avoiding captchas with a proof of work based on crypto but then damnit I know what that would look like to the normal user.
660 2018-01-27 22:44:38 yep, I'll write instructions... great time to learn some #cryptogramming :) (desperately trying to coin the hashtag lol) ... make crypto fun, by consuming financial data ... Data is king :)
661 2018-01-27 22:44:36 There are examples of ANY cryptocurrency where users lost coins because they did not secure their seed well enough. In crypto there are no banks, no helpdesks, no state, who can return your funds.

667 2018-01-27 22:44:13 Holy shit! People do not send your #crypto to people who claim to 20X your investment or the first 20 people to deposit $LTC to an account get a chance to win more #litecoin. This is a scam! If you want a real lottery, follow @LTC_lottery They do live video drawings.

680 2018-01-27 22:42:50 Mining is a great way to start. There are several ASIC-resistant coins out there to start accumulating some crypto without any additional investment. Vertcoin has a very simple miner that you can run on a computer you already have. Start the miner, then learn TA/FA. Then invest.
681 2018-01-27 22:42:48 So @raiblocks only has four team members, and the top 10 accounts hold 81% of the voting power.... On top of that, there was no ico, the tokens were all given out for free from a faucet. To all the investors, be careful!

687 2018-01-27 22:42:19 Very good analysis of the DeepOnion project. The only point I must add  is that the DeepOnion mobile wallet is ready to be released and will allow everyone on this planet to stake crypto on smartphone 24/7. It's a  pretty innovative feature in terms of energy efficiency

742 2018-01-27 22:34:58 Off the bottom, but I was better off a week ago. Keep getting "Zcash is at an all-time low" from Delta. Would be nice if ADA would move up...even a little bit.
743 2018-01-27 22:34:57 I'm wouldn't assume this means new money though. Its most likely made up of a large number of people already in crypto that have accounts on all the other exchanges

747 2018-01-27 22:34:42 You're not alone. I'm in a similar situation. I almost gave up crypto trading today :(
748 2018-01-27 22:34:37 Huge News! Thanks for sharing!
749 2018-01-27 22:34:33 There are enough terrible bitcoin stories now that you could literally make a TALES FROM THE CRYPTO horror-comedy show.
750 2018-01-27 22:34:32 @CryptoGat look at $CAG. 20 Mill marketcap. Partnership with Kyber, Estonia, ETHLend. Consolidating nicely.

751 2018-01-27 22:34:26 I have no idea on the profitability here regarding difficulty, electricity cost, set up cost etc for it being worth the investment? VS say buying 5K Bitbean and get your 40% a year which is a good average of possibilities out there? Thanks
752 2018-01-27 22:34:23 @Socal_crypto @notsofast  mine any @Garliccoin ? Been years since I spec mined. Feels good man.

754 2018-01-27 22:34:15 Cool stuff
755 2018-01-27 22:34:12 I’m sure the government will do whatever is best for crypto....
756 2018-01-27 22:34:12 I'm not holding my breath. I gave them my details for the free sub t-shirt promo ages ago. 

That never arrived either....
757 2018-01-27 22:34:11 I am very excited about the airdrop!!!!  I need more coins.......... :)
758 2018-01-27 22:33:58 Can you share a dimension of "packed"?
759 2018-01-27 22:33:56 We agree, no one should be using credit cards to buy crypto. Debit cards are okay.

763 2018-01-27 22:33:38 Don't try using the Chart Scanner or Social Scanner... they're either not "yet" available. Crypto Ticker doesn't work. No iOS/Android app, either... "Yet". Trading is only available on a few exchanges, but not 45+. Maybe I should'nt have bought the subscription "yet"...

765 2018-01-27 22:33:19 Thanks much for response. I appreciate your focus on decentralization. That feature will be very important to people in future. I have really good feeling about $DGB. I suspect it will be significant part of the new crypto financial system that is coming. Keep up the great work!

767 2018-01-27 22:32:51 The issue you are hinting at is that there is no _direct_ incentive to run a node. With btc and eth, you can run a node yourself to verify the network and be sure that everything is valid. With iota, you can run a node privately to make sure that a.o. your own txs are faster.

774 2018-01-27 22:31:56 Likely still classified. And anyhow, if it is indeed crypto, that would be on a separate module/board, what is in the phone would be only an interface for it.
775 2018-01-27 22:31:56 Always about it!

Ive been in one telegram group for a while but some of these guys really know what theyre talking about regarding trading and none of them are those 25k+ crypto accounts that have a bunch of followers and all they post is random banter for seeks lol
776 2018-01-27 22:31:50 Until it doesn’t scale lol
777 2018-01-27 22:31:37 And I thought U were talking about some crypto currency block number and a hard fork of that currency...

803 2018-01-27 22:29:17 I agree with you, but the beauty of crypto is that you don’t have to use an extra layer of tech in order to be transparent. And more important, thanks to blockchain it’s not corruptible.

836 2018-01-27 22:26:54 Speaking of health care. One of my main motivators for getting into crypto was/is to try and off set the ridiculous cost to insure my family of four in CA.

Each node still has the choice to keep (or load) the transaction data from before the snapshot. It has nothing to do with scaling in terms of CTPS (confirmed transactions per second).

849 2018-01-27 22:25:57 It's easy to say you're focused on your work instead of profits when you've already bagged millions.  I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's common sense.  A lot of people talk about being in crypto to change the world..
850 2018-01-27 22:25:49 Bloomberg.. the one source that hates the idea of crypto currency says this... and we actually print it?!?
851 2018-01-27 22:25:44 Took my nephew to work on his bball skills, some other kids there wanted me to teach them too.

Gonna have to start charging crypto currency for my hoop sessions. Where's these kids dads?
852 2018-01-27 22:25:42 @officialmcafee has a huge followership on twitter and uses his tweets to pump specific cryptocurrency coins. He is the most sort after crypto whale.
853 2018-01-27 22:25:37 Yeah, that would be my guess too. It looks like military hw, so either some kind of scrambler/crypto or a data modem.

860 2018-01-27 22:24:58 Man at bar asks me about crypto because I look like a nerd I guess?
861 2018-01-27 22:24:49 Thanks for the reply.  Even if this is common in patent law, I am just curious as to the reasoning. I am an attorney myself, and am wondering why you would not want to name the firm that is representing you?
862 2018-01-27 22:24:33 je l'ai acheté ATH mais on se sent trader
863 2018-01-27 22:24:30 I know plenty about crypto and I have several coins. I’ve lost literally a few dollars and my main portfolio is up around 1000%. Kinda hard to google translate a picture genius. So maybe you should do your own research first before opening your mouth and being so negative twat.
864 2018-01-27 22:24:25 I very much believe in and expect so. #Ethereum is the best thing after the crypto world got since #bitcoin.

868 2018-01-27 22:23:45 Ok thank you mate all I can do now is hope the bcc does raise a little more so I can cash out my 7.7 bcc coins as now they worth around 70$ which cost me around 200$ for 7.7 bcc a week and half ago  thanks for all you’re help we need more people like yourself. Very helpful.

973 2018-01-27 22:10:14 The team has put out a bounty for miners to exchange their zcl for 1.25 btcp so they can sell the mined zcl, and get an exchange listing.

1034 2018-01-27 22:04:15 Buying crypto (or stock) on credit is maybe not the best idea anyways? I do think it should be your own choice but some do need the protection I guess.

I really feel for the people who have given them hundreds of BTC. Bit connect needs to pay for what they have done
1050 2018-01-27 22:02:35 wish you best of luck in crypto success.

1054 2018-01-27 22:02:19 It may be worth reaching out to Cryptobud @CryptoLeung as I know he studies and covers NEO and related projects. This project would be one he’d be a fan of I’m sure! He’s really good at doing his homework on the tech and would see the value and huge potential of $ELA!

1059 2018-01-27 22:01:28 Could be, or maybe not. They’re saying it’s a huge announcement. It’s worth the upside imo.
1060 2018-01-27 22:01:16 There are a few but I am keeping my eye on the privacy niche in crypto. It has been in the spotlight more and more and I believe it could be a big thing in 2018! Projects like @monerocurrency and @DeepOnionx look like solid projects! #privacy #TOR

1062 2018-01-27 22:01:01 That $580m theft of crypto is really worrying. $650m is a lot of money. How do you compensate people for the $430m that’s lost?
1063 2018-01-27 22:01:01 #DAVORCOIN is the next bitconnect. Still falling in value and they are keeping people from selling.

1107 2018-01-27 21:57:05 Not Arcblock or any other ICO that demands a minimum purchase amount. That is not what crypto is about.

1112 2018-01-27 21:56:27 Bitcoin has the most volume is most popular and is still the standard that all other Cryptocurrency is compared to and "pegged" to still. Meaning if Bitcoin is up other Crypto currencies will too but if it goes down most others will follow.
1113 2018-01-27 21:56:22 Interesting read

1119 2018-01-27 21:55:35 Dude if you want long term buy any other cryptos #Bitconnect #BitconnectX are scams that use people need of money to get more money, just buy Bitcoin for your children even if it's 0.01 ! They can control BCC and BCCX they can't BTC that's why they ask you your #BTC !
1120 2018-01-27 21:55:25 Sent...!   Hopefully I was fast enough?
1121 2018-01-27 21:55:20 that would be a 5B valuation with current supply, very possible. Considering that youtube has a 75B valuation and LBC is much more than a video streamer. Bullish on LBC
1122 2018-01-27 21:55:16 tZero !! What do you guys think of that ICO? Their whitepaper is coming out tomorrow! I get updates so ican post a link here when it comes out

1124 2018-01-27 21:55:02 I've updated the giveaway.
1125 2018-01-27 21:54:47 really sucks to see Bitcoin and most crypto like he isn't poor is the funniest thing in the world he's so dumb looking for bitch
1126 2018-01-27 21:54:42 but this kind of platform is only useful for big payments like if you'd want to buy a house. Because when credit or debit crypto card will be out and working. SALT lending will not be of use for anything else.
1127 2018-01-27 21:54:41 I do agree with your statement. Crypto exchanges are slowly morphing into banks as more and more crypto/USD is store on exchanges.

1129 2018-01-27 21:54:34 People who  truly beleive in crypto also have to have a moral compass  in the old days if a bad man walked into a bar people would turn there back on that person thrives and scammers  we need to turn our backs on  don't trade speak or watch or subscribe to there iTunes channel

1137 2018-01-27 21:53:45 Keep a watchful eye out on $Qwark over the next few weeks. Outstanding dev team led by Ubiq’s Luke Williams @iquidus. Based on my research, I believe that it will be the best crypto payment service available. I loaded up on this dip.
1138 2018-01-27 21:53:33 Looks like this on other coins too. I'm waiting to see what happens. I'm looking the daily on TRX and everything is showing upside potential..We'll see if it plays out, I've already made my gains on TRX though and I'm just looking to flip the profits haha
1139 2018-01-27 21:53:28 It is a shitcoin which will get dumped when profits have been made. Take profits and put it in a good project. Nothing bad about it
1140 2018-01-27 21:53:19 For sure! Was a confusion with exchanges the last weeks but anything to do about it... Has to be done. I found really good the Reaktion of the Team. The problem is the Devs are too fast and the exchanges to lazy
1141 2018-01-27 21:53:15 Pretty Sure that people will be in shock and awe when thy witness $SC , $DGB , and $FUN all hit $1 a coin.

1143 2018-01-27 21:53:06 I still have a long way to go. No losses in avarage, but still 40% down from ATH.
1144 2018-01-27 21:53:05 If security is the central benefit to many crypto use cases, then it should be relatively simple to compare cost of insuring centralized data liability vs decentralized, ledger-secured liability to see if there's a compelling business reason to switch. Has anyone done this?

1153 2018-01-27 21:52:13 What a wanker I have only lost around 200$ yes that was to purchase 4 bccx 1 for each of my children and 1 for me and my wife to hopefully help in the future. To now realise I have 7,7 bcc worth around 70$. I feel for the others who have lost much more than I have 
1154 2018-01-27 21:52:10 Cheers I'll check it out

1157 2018-01-27 21:51:42 Awesome. Slowly people are realizing that crypto isn’t a one trick pony that is just trying to replace fiat.

1161 2018-01-27 21:51:21 Crypto or GTFO
1162 2018-01-27 21:51:21 The FAQ is nothing major. I wouldn't worry about a copy & paste man. The white paper appears to be solid and 100% original. I wouldn't spread FUD since its common for foreign companies to copy other policies.Most popular cryptos are forks of another crypto when you think about it

1170 2018-01-27 21:50:31 Cheers for the TA! Logical, no bs, and on-point as always. I'm as sick of the bearishness as anyone else in crypto right now, but it is what it is.
1171 2018-01-27 21:50:24 Was just thinking earlier today where the hell is she, im brand new to twitter and crypto you were my first follow keep us posted
1172 2018-01-27 21:50:24 Such a short-term mindset.  If you think xrp is doomed you truly do not understand global banking.  Xrp isn’t a get rich quick pick. You cannot convince the global banking system to change how they operate overnight.

1176 2018-01-27 21:49:51 I think the revealing thing here is that 5 percent say buy Tzero.

The short case is that Tzero is a total flop. Shorts should be scared. 

(I think incidentally that is a highly probable long-term. Short term it's a crypto and can do anything...)

1214 2018-01-26 23:57:35 To be fair technically they are giving 100% bonus. Price was previously 25cents per token and is now 12.5cents.
1215 2018-01-26 23:57:24 Really this is embarrassing you got @davidgokhshtein who has no proper knowledge of crypto ... caused so many people financial loss trying to promote coins he’s only invested in , he also can’t draw a chart ... calls everything hodl and long term.... embarrassing!

1218 2018-01-26 23:56:09 What is it? A witches coven?
1219 2018-01-26 23:56:04 please stop doing this every time they make any announcement. Its ridiculous. I'm pretty sure that any crypto developers are aware that it would be advantageous to be listed on large exchanges like Binance and I would be shocked if they aren't trying to make that happen
1220 2018-01-26 23:55:58 Holy shit. Robin hood is now on the crypto wave.... commission-free
1221 2018-01-26 23:55:57 Is it free?

Crackpot theory, they don’t have the system set up to transact yet, just a growth hacking scheme to grow signups. 

Same with desktop app, and options trading.

1238 2018-01-26 23:53:53 As of Friday afternoon, more than half a million people were waiting to get early access to Robinhood's crypto trading platform.
1239 2018-01-26 23:53:52 CNBC is the banks megaphone, they are giving Bitcoin oxygen at the moment because they fear if BTC dives it will undermine XRP before it gets established as a Bitcoin competitor. Make no mistake the banks want a crypto they control.
1240 2018-01-26 23:53:52 Yeah, Bitcoin Cash was supposed to go to zero a few months ago too.

Core rushed LN onto mainnet without a routing algorithm. They're scared because Bitcoin Cash works as intended and they might not be able to pay back the 75mil in Blockstream investors.

1254 2018-01-26 23:52:01 i honestly fear for these people who've made crypto their whole identity...so many have adopted this crypto-genius persona amongst their friends/family; it will be devastating when it all goes away. the ego is what will destroy people, not the monetary loss.

Normalde bütün icolar da satılmayan tokenler yakılır. Cobinhood bunu reddetti. Şirkete kalır dedi. Ico tokenleri etherdelta da ico boyunca daha ucuza satıldı.
Şimdi şirketin elinde çok token var ve fiyatı baskiliyor.

1276 2018-01-26 23:48:54 It has a real purpose, a good team, and already partners with major company’s. Sub penny prices now means you can get a lot of coins, once price hits even low levels in comparison it’s huge gains.
1277 2018-01-26 23:48:48 I believe the rewards are given in % usd. So if ur reward is $5 and the coin is $5, u would get 1 proc...so doesn't matter what the price of the coin is.
1278 2018-01-26 23:48:45 So far 630k people are signed up for early access to Robinhood crypto. Coinbase best check itself.
1279 2018-01-26 23:48:42 Is that directed at me? I'm in my 50's I hate my life and will be thankful when it ends. In the mean time until it does I get by. I plan ahead for others. All of my crypto will be left to my nephew if mass adoption does not happen in my life.

1319 2018-01-26 23:44:49 XRP will lose 95% of its market cap. From 50 Billion market cap to 250 million. XRP=biggest pile hype bullshit so far in the history of crypto.  When the rats really start abandoning ship, this will be a spectacular crash.  Save this tweet. #XRP #Ripple #cryptocurrency #crypto
1320 2018-01-26 23:44:38 افضل نقطة دخول عدت قبل كم يوم ولكن الدخول الان مش سيئ أبدا لان الهدف على مدى متوسط ٢٠٠ والآن وبعد البريك أوت ١٢٠+ يعني ممكن تدخل على عدة دخلات وحاول كل مرة تدخل بسعر اقل. بالتوفيق
1321 2018-01-26 23:44:37 This great crypto depression needs to end soon like
1322 2018-01-26 23:44:18 That’s the start of a sociopath. First you start spooning, before you know it you’ll be forking people!
1323 2018-01-26 23:44:07 Yeah, but you can only trade crypto from like 4 states in the US.
1324 2018-01-26 23:44:07 Only if other people accept it's value though. How can you not see it's still on faith? Gold or Silver still has value even if it's artificial "scarcity" value is high and crashes, it still has value. Crypto holds ZERO value without it's network.
1325 2018-01-26 23:44:02 仮想通貨という名前が良くない。暗号通貨ということは、暗号が解読されると取られちゃうという事ですよね。取引所のセキュリティとしては、最低限のことですよね。いくらコールドWalletに保管しても、取引する時は、取引所に預けなきゃいけない？安心できないよね。
1326 2018-01-26 23:43:49 China (and others) already tried this multiple times, yet people there still find ways to purchase crypto.

And there'll always be states that don't ban. Nobody's going to convince every nation in the world that banning a multi-trillion dollar market is in their self-interest.
1327 2018-01-26 23:43:38 今回のcoincheckの件ですが…私も資産の半分を預けていました。暴落後取引停止になる前にXRPをJPYにしましたが、その後取引も出金もでぎず。。
このまま出せなくなるか、出せるとしても、JPY化したあとに値上がりしていくのを見ているのは辛いですね。。

1333 2018-01-26 23:42:55 Who is ready to join one of the FOURTY MILLION EXPERTS these days popping up in the crypto market, say I
1334 2018-01-26 23:42:50 Marrying a man who has #crypto will solve the problem.
1335 2018-01-26 23:42:48 Close friends who btw knows little about crypto currencies advice not to invest due to their past experiences which reminds them of something similar in resemblance but quite different. 
1336 2018-01-26 23:42:45 So, you assume that everyone who puts $100 on Crypto are there to get rich overnight, if that was the case wouldn't the IOTA be stole from the exchange not in the wallet. I would imagine for someone to leave IOTA on the wallet would be leaving it there for Long run......
1337 2018-01-26 23:42:44 Well said. #VergeFam $XVG $crypto
1338 2018-01-26 23:42:44 We called President Obama by his last name. Maybe you're triggered too easily? I'll bite, though. MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP and the @GOP are stealing thousands of acres of public lands that BELONG TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. (Caps for emphasis!) How's that, Crypto?
1339 2018-01-26 23:42:31 Bittrex is dead to me. Still no #Ignis after a month. Had #BTC in YoBit and got #BCA hours after the fork. How hard is it #Bittrex??? #Crypto
1340 2018-01-26 23:42:20 Stealing $XRP or $NEM is like eating that one thing on the food table that nobody wants or likes. #crypto
1341 2018-01-26 23:42:17 @realDonaldTrump The Crypto market is rsltng in a severe misallocation of resources. All that money would otherwise be flowing in the US markets. Blkchain tech is good but tons of scams being run. Bitcoin and Crypto bubble must be deflated before Tax Fraud and alt think to Dollar
1342 2018-01-26 23:42:15 @IOHK_Charles Actually I would be really interested to hear from an investment standpoint (besides ADA and Cardano) what would you put money into within crypto? BTC? ETH? anything jump out as an awesome project to you? You have such a depth of understanding I am interested.
1343 2018-01-26 23:42:11 Anybody notice how quickly this fake @iSatoshiLite account blocked me? That's cause he's been reported by several people as soon as I tweeted it. Scammers get crushed that fast. #Crypto
1344 2018-01-26 23:42:04 How do you trade without coins in the exchange ?
1345 2018-01-26 23:42:02 ニュースの拡散を感じる
1346 2018-01-26 23:42:00 @PhilakoneCrypto Just started with crypto. Your videos/info are a real lifeline. THANK YOU!!! Quick question. I see that you work on Bitfinex. I am in the US and can't work with Bitfinex. What program can you recommend? Thanks
1347 2018-01-26 23:41:57 Moved 75% of my $TRX holdings to $OCN a few days ago. Still a good time to enter, just wait for a dip first if you are scared buying at ATH. I will be taking profits off the table to move back into $TRX as price increases. 

Might post an analysis later.

1349 2018-01-26 23:41:39 @aelfblockchain super excited to be part of the crypto revolution!
1350 2018-01-26 23:41:27 Specific date ?
1351 2018-01-26 23:41:26 k eat a snicker.
1352 2018-01-26 23:41:25 今こそ、自分の働き方改革。ある程度のスペック搭載のパソコン一台と電話さえあれば、どこでも仕事にはなる。
1353 2018-01-26 23:41:18 One that doesn't require to be an investor, one that want sellout instantly and one that doesn't reward its pre buyers with so many tokens they get dumped to the floor in the first day on exchange )
1354 2018-01-26 23:41:14 I sometimes wonder, albeit ignorant, why @Visa and @Mastercard are so obstructive to #cryptocurrency? They already have a platform, which I assume that they could quite easily integrate with #crypto? #Monopoly #bitcoin #COINBASE
1355 2018-01-26 23:41:13 Crypto uses more electricity to create than a small country. It may be a potential new source of currency but not in our lifetime or with our resources; not in its current guise at least.
1356 2018-01-26 23:41:10 Oo.. I wish betterment support it. RT @entiCyn: Robinhood now supports crypto investing, nice
1357 2018-01-26 23:41:07 明日は我が身
投資にしろ何にしろホント大事な言葉だと思う
1358 2018-01-26 23:41:03 @aelfblockchain about out to the best team in crypto #ELF
1359 2018-01-26 23:41:03 Looking like $1.09 USD at the moment.  Great entry price.
1360 2018-01-26 23:40:49 You cannot believe in #crypto and not hodl some #BTC in your portfolio. Try and apply logic to the chaos. #hodl #moonchain
1361 2018-01-26 23:40:49 Probably because every one is Hodling. We need some new investors :)
1362 2018-01-26 23:40:49 That’s reminds me, can I have some free crypto?
1363 2018-01-26 23:40:32 Go make another fake account, Crypto. How many do you have now? 200?
1364 2018-01-26 23:40:24 Reason why they are charging extra: Visa& MC credit & debit cards come with a no liability guarantee. Ppl can go 2 their bank & dispute charges. Recently ppl have been disputing exchange purchases, after they lose money in crypto.
1365 2018-01-26 23:40:22 Well at least crypto-fascists like Phares are getting their’s
1366 2018-01-26 23:40:20 I’ve been slackin on crypto this week
1367 2018-01-26 23:40:16 What is the best crypto you think of these
1368 2018-01-26 23:40:10 Oh my god, I sold out and got some crypto currency.. Talked all that shit, did my research, changed my mind.. 
1369 2018-01-26 23:40:06 追いエイムとリコイル制御がまるでだめ
1370 2018-01-26 23:39:55 I see it as Crypto over Cash
1371 2018-01-26 23:39:47 Get going!
1372 2018-01-26 23:39:43 Robinhood will have no fee Options AND Crypto currencies soon. Happy Days
1373 2018-01-26 23:39:43 What are you using to see the price? What is now.  Thanks!

1376 2018-01-26 23:39:36 Seems like everyone in crypto nowadays calls him/herself "Crypto X". @Cryptobully, @crypto_rand @crypto_capone @crypto_bobby @nondualnelly. 
Not me though, I'm a born rebel. 
I go against the grain. 

p.s. not gonna lie, I'm very bullish on crypto though.
1377 2018-01-26 23:39:33 Your name says it all. You need more!!!
1378 2018-01-26 23:39:27 倒産して投資家保護発動かな…
コインチェックに沢山入れてた人の金で保証ってのが現実的な気が…
言い方悪くて嫌だけど
1379 2018-01-26 23:39:24 What you trying to find out? I’m a Software Engineer at USC doing research on crypto currency 
1380 2018-01-26 23:39:23 Looking good! $DRGN $crypto
1381 2018-01-26 23:39:17 Why don’t you change your name to bitcoin cash your always trying to pump it yeah btc fee’s are higher and bch are lower but a Ferrari is also more expensive to service than a ford what would you rather have a cheap knockoff or the real thing
1382 2018-01-26 23:39:17 ビットクラブのシミュレーション：
1シェアー当たりの採掘量は，これまで一定値で近似できましたが，9月15日から減って来ています。2018-01現在は以前の1/6ぐらいに。採掘量の変動を考慮した形に改良してみてその減少ぶりにびっくり。
1383 2018-01-26 23:39:10 Yes it is
1384 2018-01-26 23:39:09 So many greats news about crypto, but explain to me why my blockfolio looking like 2008 recession?? #btc #bitcoin #ltc #litecoin #xrp #ripple #xlm #stellar #doge #dgb #Coinbase #robinhoodapp #nyc #pac #telcoin #Lend #ETHLEND #eth #bch

1386 2018-01-26 23:38:48 I was in a meeting today and the topic came up about how fintech companies are chipping away at banks. For sure crypto is a hit on the banks.
1387 2018-01-26 23:38:44 ridiculous
1388 2018-01-26 23:38:31 Lightning Network was supposed to be a couple of years away just a few months ago... By the way remember #BCash and jokecoin #doge do a similar number of transactions every day. Either doge is undervalued or #BCash is trading in the clouds...
1389 2018-01-26 23:38:22 Like I said. It will be a success Dude.
1390 2018-01-26 23:38:20 Interested
1391 2018-01-26 23:38:19 When? Not for a while
1392 2018-01-26 23:38:19 ... duuuude. Come on.
1393 2018-01-26 23:38:19 @1190cs
1394 2018-01-26 23:38:06 仮想通貨のランキングもいいけど、取引所のランキングが必要と言うことですね。取引量だけでは、安全とは言えないことがわかりました！
1395 2018-01-26 23:38:04 How long till @coinbase  and @coinspotau reduce their fees with @RobinhoodApp taking most of their business.
1396 2018-01-26 23:38:04 You are truly doing us a favour. There are a lot of people who have incredible insights in Crypto and I am balls deep in research but it means nothing if you fundamentally don’t have a clue about the financial market and trading. So thank you for all to come.
1397 2018-01-26 23:37:56 People on the right love to conceal their actual ideas behind different names like "alt-right" and "classical liberalism". Leftists wear their ideals on their sleeve, commies will tell you their ideas. But you still see people thinking "crypto-Marxists" are a thing.
1398 2018-01-26 23:37:46 I don't think crypto is for everyone. people dream of investing 100$ and get rich over night. and even don't know/care how the tech works or what they invest in. I feel for everyone who was scammed but they clearly "didn't read/care "! In crypto you loose instant!
1399 2018-01-26 23:37:42 I’m constantly amazed at how few people have a long term view in crypto & lack the patience to see projects come to fruition. It’s as if they think they can get rich quick in crypto.
1400 2018-01-26 23:37:35 I’ve been wanting to do this for awhile!! Time to give back to the Crypto Community which has treated me so well!! 

Give me a follow!!
1401 2018-01-26 23:37:30 But for example I will never support a crypto like Monero, because of its criminal aspect with anonymity. But maybe I’m wrong, just a feeling
1402 2018-01-26 23:37:24 %80 dusmesini.bekliyorsa yukselecek diyorsun yaniliyormuyum.
1403 2018-01-26 23:37:22 Indeed. What worries me more though is all the people complaining about GPU prices and people saying it's good if it crashes cause crypto isn't real currency. What do they think those pieces of paper they use are? Or the "money" they use to pay for stuff with on their credit card
1404 2018-01-26 23:37:13 Now, now, don't belittle yourself!  oddly familiar...
1405 2018-01-26 23:37:10 コインに落ち目はないのに叩く人が多く出そうで困るよ〜
1406 2018-01-26 23:37:08 cuck
1407 2018-01-26 23:36:59 This is why i wish the crypto market would just crash. We'd get flooded with high end GPU's on clist, ebay, amazon, and NewEgg.

1410 2018-01-26 23:36:41 Consejo para trading ahorita que está atorado el mercado, metan mini órdenes entre $BTC - $LTC y siempre vendan en ganancia de ida y vuelta, incrementando cualquiera de los dos saldos, de esta forma si comienza la subida no se quedan en FIAT y los dos van a irse juntos #crypto
1411 2018-01-26 23:36:39 Who do I know that is an active swing trader? Stocks. Not crypto. Starting my journey and looking to see who else is out there
1412 2018-01-26 23:36:35 @crypto_fred finally testing a potential breakout. Watch BTC/USD pairing closely as well
1413 2018-01-26 23:36:31 #crypto #cryptocurrency #altcoins freshers..Dunno run any code/model you find on any datasets. There is a theoretical background behind every model. Not hard but need sometime to get confident.
1414 2018-01-26 23:36:30 Followed all,  there can never be too much knowledge
1415 2018-01-26 23:36:26 Crypto is pure speculation,not driven by fundamentals;the gatekeepers are unknown, unregulated and unaccountable. A public that has rallied  against banks& bankers are happy to put their trust in a synthetic invention for imagined wealth that may be a fools gold.
1416 2018-01-26 23:36:21 What do you think of the dibbs ico?

1422 2018-01-26 23:35:49 みずなしりん氏の活躍と #XEM の仕様により、「仮想通貨は盗難に遭っても追跡できる」ことの認知が広がるっていうポジティブな影響も考えられる。金は鋳潰したら追えないことは誰でもわかるから、希望はあるんじゃなかろうか。 #XEM #NEM #crypto

1435 2018-01-26 23:33:59 When bitcoin was at 20k the market cap for crypto was 380BN. The market cap is currently 550BN with an all time high of 850BN. It’s shitcoin season. Happens every time bitcoin cools off, plenty of money being made don’t worry.
1436 2018-01-26 23:33:59 Crypto = crypto zoology. Bigfoot is real!
1437 2018-01-26 23:33:57 さすがスポーツトレーナー！＾＾時間をあけると落ち着いて考えられるものもありますからね＾＾
1438 2018-01-26 23:33:48 3/ Look, I was just as opposed to Ripple as anyone in crypto, but I see now that I would like XRP to succeed much more than I would like it to fail & banks and VISA succeed instead. We all lose in that scenario. This is why I just invested in it. Many more will follow.

1453 2018-01-26 23:31:55 Many of my coworkers use @RobinhoodApp. I think this will drive new people (and therefore volume) into crypto. 0 fees was a pretty big reason to move my trading away from @TDAmeritrade
1454 2018-01-26 23:31:54 What is Verge #XVG?
Verge is freedom from the system, an idea and a work in progress. It is light years ahead of its challengers but like anything new. It is yet to be understood. When the masses see the true potential it will be too late for them to invest, keep hodling vergefam
1455 2018-01-26 23:31:49 We're just as excited! Looking forward to it!
1456 2018-01-26 23:31:49 この対応はBTC GOXにはない神対応ですよね。月曜日の取引所再開からNEXどうなるか見ものですね！
1457 2018-01-26 23:31:45 Agreed. I actually listen to the speech/live stream. There were no boos.
1458 2018-01-26 23:31:43 4 times my investment but for a coin that was once top three its lost a lot of investors and during this crypto black Friday sale it shed 60% from ATH compared to BTC and ETH its getting beat up.
1459 2018-01-26 23:31:40 Too bad only 5 states will be able to use the crypto functionality of the app to start...
1460 2018-01-26 23:31:39 Thanks for all the #FF
1461 2018-01-26 23:31:35 Joe, do you personally own crypto coins of some sort?  Do you think it will survive?

1463 2018-01-26 23:31:33 You say but have you looked into what a proper routing algorithm will require?

Last I saw that tech might be a decade away...

1465 2018-01-26 23:31:22 You did a great job representing the crypto. Suppoman Could of done a better job of interviewing you instead of acting like a teenager who just discovered girls..geez..looking forward to your ico.. cheers
1466 2018-01-26 23:31:13 I wish, but too far away :-( But I do like HILA5 so far :) I was just curious about the extreme speed of decapsulation (in comp. to Frodo/kyber/Sike/ntru)
1467 2018-01-26 23:31:10 @CryptoMessiah Question: I did my own research on ARD, concept ok but pls give few arguments why this crypto is solid? Many other coins offering platforms and also childchains. Serious question, please assist
1468 2018-01-26 23:30:47 The Pirate Bay probably does not get much BTC donations these days with the fees and stuck transactions. Hardly a barometer of crypto sentiments when they have clearly been delusional about hating BCH. Bitpay is actually a big deal.
1469 2018-01-26 23:30:46 It doesn't seem that I can DM you. But I'm interested.

1474 2018-01-26 23:30:17 This is brilliant news, should help ease both $DRGN holders and LifeID's future investors minds. im guessing the airdrop bit means it will be for kyc registered $DRGN holders ?

1477 2018-01-26 23:29:53 I agree. I'm glad he addressed it and the manner in which he did. Respect to you @MichaelSuppo I think everyone can and should be more respectful to any woman and also man entering the crypto community. It takes alot of courage and determination to do so. #respecttoall

1496 2018-01-26 23:28:16 #Robinhood is adding crypto currency pretty cool stuff as far as valuation goes. They need to use #StellarLumens and #Litecoin. Also all of those need a more so Daytradding platform so hopefully they don’t hold the same 25k limit for
1497 2018-01-26 23:27:45 Md5 is totally fine to uniquely represent a file in a none crypto situation. 4 billion files has a 1 in 2.7x10^-20 chance of a collision. (Ignore the crypto police)
1498 2018-01-26 23:27:45 Trusted third-parties may be security holes, but how come most hacks overwhelmingly happen in crypto? Is it because hacking, say Wells Fargo is next to impossible or is it because crypto hacks are unpunishable/untraceable as of yet? cc @NickSzabo4 @devilscompiler @eiaine
1499 2018-01-26 23:27:44 That is awesome.  $LRC should follow suit soon.
1500 2018-01-26 23:27:35 Agreed. People need to stop that shit unless they want crypto to die a violent death

1504 2018-01-26 23:27:12 Sheree! You did a great job holding yourself in a very professional manner in spite of the awkward distractions that played out. My name is “Cheree” also! Great to see a woman rep for crypto! Right on!

1522 2018-01-26 23:25:22 信用を完全に失ったコインチェックが単独で復活するのは無理だと思う。やはり、まずは買い取ってもらって、顧客にお金を返す。そして親が糞なシステムを改修して、リブランディングして、悪いイメージを払拭して…のパターンしか現実的にないんじゃないかな。

1583 2018-01-26 23:20:00 Got banned aswell! This is such a scam... Avoid at all cost people!
1584 2018-01-26 23:19:58 What about $IC ?
1585 2018-01-26 23:19:55 I’m awaiting the redefinition of “cc payment” to mean crypto currency payment

1589 2018-01-26 23:19:30 While it depends on the specific facts of the transaction, being paid in crypto seems like it presents fewer potential ethical issues than being paid with an ownership stake in the client (a practice that’s allowed in eg California if certain conditions are met).

1594 2018-01-26 23:19:02 I don't know much about RailBlocks tbh. Still haven't researched it.

1598 2018-01-26 23:18:28 Yes agreed. It's very achievable.

1603 2018-01-26 23:17:55 Are you against Crypto? Why?

1606 2018-01-26 23:17:38 This is awesome, kudos! See gold bugs and crypto fans can be friends. I've been saying this for a year.
1607 2018-01-26 23:17:36 This is a great reason to move to decentralized exchanges.  0x (#ZRX) is creating a platform for decentralized exchanges to run on top of Ethereum and share liquidity.  Great concept that could solve some of the biggest problems in crypto.

1617 2018-01-26 23:16:43 But we are supposed to HODL  these crypto gurus that employ hodl theory while you could be taking advantage of our opportunities delight me
1618 2018-01-26 23:16:34 Why will a state ever need crypto in cashless? Once all things are centralized,there may even no need to banks beside a CB. If crypto stuff finds its place as a complementary one similar to other alt.currencies being used today, then the war against it will probably be dirty.
1619 2018-01-26 23:16:27 Hey Brother, can u pls recommend any book  about crypto currency or Blockchain?  It will be much appreciated man . I’m waiting for ur reply Boss all the way from Australia @DiaryofaMadeMan
1620 2018-01-26 23:16:20 I hope you're all right? I wanted to talk about HILA5 to you for quite some time, but I wasn't sure if you're up to it. :-/
1621 2018-01-26 23:16:15 Sorry you have to deal with this, clearly people are ignorant baffoons. Great work on NEM's part to do everything in their power to alleviate the situation. The NEM situation is at the heart of crypto's survivability and public perception. The crypto community supports you.
1622 2018-01-26 23:16:15 Stop shilling it. I got into the crypto a few days ago and I've been doing nothing but losing money since then.
1623 2018-01-26 23:16:09 Crypto is not going anywhere.
1624 2018-01-26 23:16:05 Do you think he would be interested in writing whitepaper reviews?
1625 2018-01-26 23:15:45 Just getting a little preview of the crypto space in 10-15 years.
1626 2018-01-26 23:15:45 How the postal services is doing since email?
1627 2018-01-26 23:15:43 yes they will
1628 2018-01-26 23:15:43 lol jesus christ i could resell my gpu that ive used for like 2 years for double what i bought it because of crypto mining
1629 2018-01-26 23:15:38 Coinbase is MySpace Robinhood Crypto is Facebook???

Idk who mentioned it but damn it all starting to make sense now.
1630 2018-01-26 23:15:37 自己責任という人もいるが、これだけの資金を預かり企業として運営している以上、CMで顧客を増やす前に、セキュリティ強固が優先されるべき。でなければ、新規受付をすべきでなかった。やはり経営者として未熟としか言えない。
1631 2018-01-26 23:15:34 It's fascinating to think about the different options available with crypto. With regular fiat the only money that's hard to track is physical cash. Credit/debit cards, ACH, PayPal, Venmo, etc. are all very trackable. Crypto lets us have digital money that's hard to track, easy

1640 2018-01-26 23:14:11 Not quite, during the Taurus fiasco they were still hiring contractors in the week before the plug was pulled. Management were in the process of spending another £1.2M. LN is an example of Escalation of Commitment - poor design causes huge technical debt.

1642 2018-01-26 23:13:59 Do you think Nba totals/spreads are still beatable or is it a matter of it not being as exciting/worth your time or just crypto being more lucrative? I always find it fascinating when successful people reinvent themselves & pivot to another path.
1643 2018-01-26 23:13:54 昨日はCCの衝撃的なニュースが印象的でしたぉ。良くも悪くもNEMの名前が広がった事件。そして、やっぱりNEMは買いだぉ。
1644 2018-01-26 23:13:47 I hear you.. Just promoting a bit
1645 2018-01-26 23:13:46 Dollars and fiat monies in general are used way more than any #crypto is to fund "Illicit activities'. Imho This is just well scripted fudd as #bitcoin is a better,more usefull store of value than the dollar is. Basically it's their competition so he is just creating fudd

1652 2018-01-26 23:13:09 Actually crypto can mean cryptosexual too. If they're talking about animals like here then crypto always means crpytosexual.
1653 2018-01-26 23:12:47 Maybe mine... I got it with these words 
1654 2018-01-26 23:12:41 Gotta wait, RAM prices up, Intel fucked up big time, and Crypto mining is shitting on GPU prices. AMD stuff is the only reasonable thing right now, aside from their GPUs.
1655 2018-01-26 23:12:24 i didn't laugh about the people who got scammed. Never! the community tried to help everyone and it was heartbreaking how money people couldn't be safed in time. Whilst others use the situation to spread FUD and point fingers or write it was a hack and other nonsense ...

1667 2018-01-26 23:10:21 Thank you for sharing! I was going to ask but wasn’t sure if you would share. You’re the best, thanks!!
1668 2018-01-26 23:10:16 Who needs hackers when people can just listen to you, buy the Ripple scam, and lose their crypto that way.
1669 2018-01-26 23:09:57 Merci frere , thanks bro
1670 2018-01-26 23:09:49 I said most lol.
Clear exception, or should I say exceptional token.
1671 2018-01-26 23:09:48      Yeah emojis. And what. #Crypto 
1672 2018-01-26 23:09:45 $AMD back to 13$. Hopefully for good this time. HUGE Q should be out next week. Amd gpu cards are being sold faster than they can make them thanks to crypto mining.
1673 2018-01-26 23:09:42 Still comes back to crypto. They wouldn't need so much if so many weren't being sold. Saw one guy with over 200 of them. Ridiculous.
1674 2018-01-26 23:09:31 "Governments are going to destroy cryptocurrencies"

All the power in the world cant destroy cryptos. Crypto is an idea. Ideas are:

- Reproducible 
- Universialy distributable 
- Industructable 
- Maliable 

The only way to overcome an idea, is with a superior idea.
1675 2018-01-26 23:09:25 Heard someone today say that crypto currency wasn’t “real money”  
1676 2018-01-26 23:09:21 So if you're an adult and you legitimately lost money because of advice that a 17 year old named "Crypto Nick" gave you ... let's just say that blaming Nick is not your best litigation strategy.
1677 2018-01-26 23:09:20 Lol true
1678 2018-01-26 23:09:17 BCHの取り出し完了。Electron Cashをインストールすると，Electrumに入っているウォレットが全部見え，BCHが動かせるので，用意しておいた別のBCHウォレットにすぐに送金。送金手数料もBTCよりずっと安かった。private keyでの移動よりずっと楽。
1679 2018-01-26 23:09:03 If things are too calm in crypto you know it's time to either put money in or tether up, I'm bearish for the next couple of days so $USDT it is
1680 2018-01-26 23:09:02 It's still on standby, boring market
1681 2018-01-26 23:08:56 I was just typing something similar as I had an identical discussion here on Twitter the other day with someone regarding DTA. Circulating supply is far more relevant here than totals.

1686 2018-01-26 23:08:21 The price of @nvidia and @AMD video cards is nuts thanks to the damned crypto miners. So bad to the point that I have given up on my idea of @AMDRyzen system. It's a shame manufactuers can't keep up and everyone involved are greedy jerks. Back to consoles I go.
1687 2018-01-26 23:08:14 Look this IS a good story, but unverified sources and such, msm shows that’s a slippery slope for journalism.
1688 2018-01-26 23:08:14 People don’t realise there are massive forces at play throughout the entire crypto space splitting the community and creating tribal wars. We are being divided so that we can be conquered. The whole crypto space needs to wise up to this.
1689 2018-01-26 23:08:11 Names like PWC that most lambo boys don't know.
1690 2018-01-26 23:07:49 TBH Revolut truly has brought Crypto to the mainstream - the Rev. rate & other exchanges rates does vary slightly, but the ease of use / reliability def. makes up for it. @coinbase tend to 'close' when the market turns, Revolut hasn't done that to me yet

1697 2018-01-26 23:07:02 The Crypto thing is poison for AMD only from a media perspective - they have never made money on GPU's. AMD has made money on CPU's. In 2018 AMD is shipping Pro GPU's that have PROFITS$$ in them  - 5% of a revenue base on crypto that makes no money is vapor.

1719 2018-01-26 23:04:42 I prefer slow and steady like this every day! A massive breakout causes massive dumps and weak hands make it worst. Stellar is currently the most solid crypto right now on paper. Chart may not look great  but watch it go to 9000 sats inch by inch.

1755 2018-01-26 23:00:21 Hopefully this becomes the norm in the future. Fuck going back to fiat just cause BTC is correcting, would much rather capital keep flowing from fiat to crypto and just back and forth between BTC and alts.

1762 2018-01-26 23:00:01 I think of #litecoin as the nightly builds where the latest ideas are tested on whereas #bitcoin is the "stable" version to fall back on. #btc and #ltc can co-exist. However, $ltc can become more than $btc in the long run. We won't know exact answer until it happens...or not.

1764 2018-01-26 23:00:00 Hi Ben, its nice to see you back in the US. I would love to support you in this but I have one question. Can I join and vote on your posts without purchasing crypto currency?
1765 2018-01-26 22:59:57 Great question. If Twitter had more of these questions, we'd all be better off.

1768 2018-01-26 22:59:32 I literally didn’t see any crypto as active as Oyster. They have several telegrams where they are very active and always responding on any questions. So stop FUDding around and take your loss as a man
1769 2018-01-26 22:59:25 Noticing a growing trend with ICOs whereby they are running neverending registrations to build up HYPE. 

Then they secure high private sale funding or slap the community in the face with a poor tokensale structure/low caps.

1770 2018-01-26 22:59:22 I went to the Crypto Meetup yesterday, really nice people, soon had mooned, some were just starting, but the crazy thing was, I knew more about Alts than anyone and that let me know. it really let me know
1771 2018-01-26 22:59:22 Wow, can we have more of these questions on Twitter please? No one knows when XXX is going on Binance and no one knows when moon, but this, THIS is the good kind of question
1772 2018-01-26 22:59:22 Don't depend on luck.. if you are genuine and your intention is to do good to the society and to the people who invested in #ETP ..Luck is byproduct .. all the best!
1773 2018-01-26 22:59:18 The next wave up is starting and should result in some significant gains in the next hours. One way you can confirm the motive wave is because the volume is so low and the buy orders are still being consumed.

1781 2018-01-26 22:58:53 Also, also, accepting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum as payment for fees is not the same thing as accepting tokens. But obvi you should not take retainers in crypto - retainers must be held in trust accounts at a bank. I hate retainers anyway.
1782 2018-01-26 22:58:44 Another day of sideways movement , Consolidation and acquisition is the name of the game. There is a lot of investors and money sitting on the sidelines right now.

1832 2018-01-26 22:53:18 You do know the definition of an investment right? Putting money in to expect profit in return? So yes it’s an investment. Am I 100% invested in it? No. Do I hold btc/eth/eos/powr and many others, yes. People get just as burnt “investing” in ICO’s.

1839 2018-01-26 22:52:56 Bearish Bitcoin now in intermediate downtrend. $BTC now at $10,882 is below support level ($11,284).

1840 2018-01-26 22:52:45 Haha. Dude. Take 1000 and divide it by 0.06 and then multiply that number by 3.75. Give a man a fish he’ll eat for a day, teach a man to fish.....
1841 2018-01-26 22:52:41 Sounds fun. I can’t do much until crypto’s save me from my job. No time. I do see it coming. 
1842 2018-01-26 22:52:36 January hasn’t been to good for my crypto holdings, the whole market seems to be stuck. Decided to start investing in ICOs again. Need a break from trading.
1843 2018-01-26 22:52:35 I'm kind of there, but crypto exist right at the edge of math and engineering. That means there will be more gaps that 'innovation' as we think of it can't fix.

1908 2018-01-26 22:46:53 Thank you for letting me know  showing some love and appreciation to the wrong peeps. Will fix 
1909 2018-01-26 22:46:51 Sounds great guys! I am new to the crypto market. Can I make money while the market stays red? If so can you recommend a site and strategy to do this?
Thanks Stu
1910 2018-01-26 22:46:51 The first report is incredible. It's straight forward & accessible (if you want it to be widely adopted you'll need to keep making it as simple as possible). However, I am curious about your current portfolio; will BTC simply outperform the collection  of alts in the long run?
1911 2018-01-26 22:46:48 Uh oh. . Incoming follower wave! Thanks!
1912 2018-01-26 22:46:44 Not the last line
1913 2018-01-26 22:46:39 Rivers go downstream, just like crypto prices. You reassured how shitty crypto investing is.

1918 2018-01-26 22:46:25 Did you hear the one about the crypto day trader who got struck by lightning? He'd read the weather forecast and heard the thunder, but scoffed and said "It's all FUD."
1919 2018-01-26 22:46:18 
1920 2018-01-26 22:46:14 Yes we are, if you remove the word “typically” that is, since it is a fact
1921 2018-01-26 22:46:07 I find it silly to criticize, as it would be equally legit by extension to have criticized the FIRST devs to have "rolled their own crypto". We're to believe they got it awesomely correct the first time, and the only way to play going forward is with side chains?

Rejected.
1922 2018-01-26 22:45:57 I do as I'm told.

1924 2018-01-26 22:45:38 He wasn't even able to predict the market crash and it happens at this time each year. How did he miss that? I don't know...I'm getting grumpy 
1925 2018-01-26 22:45:36 Love the specificity. $ADA won't be $7... no no.. it will be $7.05!
1926 2018-01-26 22:45:36 #CryptocurrencyNews #ven I bought this coin a couple of days ago - see the previous tweet. It now has finished going down: macd has now crossed positive on the 3-month chart; see the crypto master app on iPhone. 10 - 20% increase the next few days.
1927 2018-01-26 22:45:25 Dude if the Church funds aspect is just a meme and everything is just "blown out of proportion" then stop having Athene act like a fucking scammer personality on stream. It still doesn't explain the "donate" to receive crypto angle to avoid Athene from selling his for fiat.

1935 2018-01-26 22:44:50 I use robinhood, but I'm not too sure of crypto stability, so I'll just wait n watch.

1944 2018-01-26 22:43:54 Crypto currencies are just digital fiat. I'm not sure how you see it otherwise. 

Maybe you could explain your understanding of fiat.

1951 2018-01-26 22:43:13 Ah yes... Gullible non thinking public, radical reform, predator scoundrel leadership... Crypto politics!
1952 2018-01-26 22:43:10 Exactly when the crypto craze starter :) Profitability is going down now so it should lower the demand and prices. Endure a bit more
1953 2018-01-26 22:43:09 We now live in a world of over 65 million refugees.If crypto has any utility, it is to enable the displaced and marginalized to send funds to loved ones whilst avoiding theft,persecution & corruption.Forget the stupid “but I can’t buy a  analogy”!#BTC #ETH #XRP #DASH #Refugees

一刻も早く解決することを願ってますが、2018年の1月にこんな大事件が起こったのは今年はDEXが加速するために起こるべきして起こった出来事だったのでは？とか考えてしまったまあ今回はCCのセキュリティの問題も大きいですが。
1978 2018-01-26 22:40:43 @TurnerHal my understanding is that teum has a service that enables payment by crypto currency - am I correct and do you have others block chain solutions??
1979 2018-01-26 22:40:36 It's not that #crypto is worth so much, it's that the dollar now buys so little.   It's about to fall off the tracks completely imo. Let's see...
1980 2018-01-26 22:40:34 The story is based on facts, this much I can say. He mentioned red rooms, dark web, crypto currency. All of these factors are standard procedures used by pedos to remain anonymous. What I don`t know is how he plans to prove this.
1981 2018-01-26 22:40:13 It's still fiat, it's worthless unless someone accepts it AS money. It has NO VALUE otherwise.

It's as valuable as downloaded imaginary Armor for your Pokemon. 

Gold, Silver, Stone, Corn, etc .etc... have value, crypto is useless. I think you've been mislead about what fiat is.
1982 2018-01-26 22:40:03 i never said to fix your stupid show. i asked about your technical background as advised by the SEC crypto statement. maybe you really believe u are clever sidestepping "missed the btc boat" with ur channel response. i think ur insults are a real eye opener about u tho .
1983 2018-01-26 22:40:00 This is exceptionally well done. I've read @JamesAltucher 's Crypto Insider; this looks 100X better. Feel free to quote me on that.
1984 2018-01-26 22:39:56 $ETC is proof that all the crypto OG's united in shilling a coin does not make it pump lol
1985 2018-01-26 22:39:56 Appreciate you considering $STRAT. But crypto isn't about fast money. It's about smart money. #Stratis is smart. No pump n dump.
1986 2018-01-26 22:39:50 I can't for the life of me figure out why some people have such a powerful conviction. We might see a prolonged slump in prices. We may see another blockchain currency become more sought after. We may well never see sub 10k again but anyone who is sure of anything is deluded.
1987 2018-01-26 22:39:34 Existe un BOT que analiza los comentarios de twitter y determina el sentimiento general de la gente hacia cada criptomoneda. Este análisis social permite revelar el sentimiento del mercado el cual es muy considerado por los grandes inversores de crypto.
1988 2018-01-26 22:39:32 Yes good riddance to them. The constant fear of having one of your coins randomly delisted, of course after they get all their insiders to sell first before announcing it.

2009 2018-01-26 22:37:49 My favorite part of downtrends is that after people freak out about the price dropping, they start talking about why crypto and blockchain matter, and what it means for the future. That's what this should all be about.

2023 2018-01-26 22:36:46 You are all such good people - you've helped so many.  My only regret is not getting into crypto a year or two (or four) ago and learning what you already know so I could help ppl also.  I hope this works out and you all become huge, you deserve it!  Thanks for all you do.

2037 2018-01-26 22:35:26 imo odds are high we never see sub 10k btc after today. although i know each and every piece of fiat i posses is wasted if not in sweet cryptos, i just cant put  them all in 
2038 2018-01-26 22:35:17 That would be a great crypto currency name now! 
2039 2018-01-26 22:35:12 I looks like you're working at CBOE, and didn't think you'd be allowed to share info like that. So assuming it's public record.. Unless I'm mistaking?
2040 2018-01-26 22:34:58 Using Binance, what is the general consensus on the best (on exchange) stored value?  $BTC $ETH $BNB ??? #binance #crypto #bitcoin #ethereum
2041 2018-01-26 22:34:57 I really dont see what gender has to do with  making investments into crypto. But I guess thats how the world works now. Find someone to blame your problems on.  Crypto is a open community for EVERYONE.

2064 2018-01-26 22:32:56 I don't have much skin in that game, so a debate among the most qualified from those respective fields would be entertaining for me. haha

This is how crypto pragmatists view vitriolic bitcoin/shitcoin debates.

2068 2018-01-26 22:32:31 Two days ago I was complaining about @marca's web page, but if even @YouTube allows crypto-miner ads...
2069 2018-01-26 22:32:30 360M now and 510M after 3 months when the presale tokens get released.
2070 2018-01-26 22:32:27 We can do that as well. 
2071 2018-01-26 22:32:21 Did a search for crypto daytrading you came up.

2073 2018-01-26 22:32:14 Just bought your spreadsheet, looks great...been deep into Crypto research myself since May. you should add Omisego to your Long term list immediately. 

Quick question for you: where do you see the Total Market Cap for crypto by June?
2074 2018-01-26 22:32:12 Aside from exchange points that convert legal tender to crypto, cryptocurrencies (esp. Bitcoin) are near impossible to regulate.
2075 2018-01-26 22:31:56 bitflux is the best crypto currency we need to support because they have the shared capacity of integrating the crypto market and will give investors huge return on investment. so dear friends let's support bitflux with all our hearts and spirit.

2080 2018-01-26 22:31:12 Would love to be the winner.
2081 2018-01-26 22:31:11 This is why I love crypto twitter. it was an eth/zrx buy. Would I see those charts on the exchange where i bought it?
2082 2018-01-26 22:31:05 I've been thinking the same thing about twitter; you can literally oberserve & participate in dialogue with some of the brightest minds in the world. When else have we ever been able to sit down with an industry leader and get their opinion? Such and underrated tool.
2083 2018-01-26 22:30:51 Hopefully at least crypto gains mainstream adoption because of the cme & cboe, nyse is next. They are all lifetime experts in markets its gonna get crazy
2084 2018-01-26 22:30:48 If the crypto market could get back on track since BTC futures has expired that would be great. These trust fund Wall Street clowns have fucked with my money enough. $btc
2085 2018-01-26 22:30:45 One of the biggest things we will see this year is the launch of #tZero @tzeroblockchain. It will use #blockchain tech to change #WallSt forever. @medici_ventures will take De Soto's ideas and bank the unbanked, give property rights to people who have no means to do so. #crypto
2086 2018-01-26 22:30:39 Oh God can something please happen with the #CRYPTO market I'm bored as hell.
2087 2018-01-26 22:30:31 Sucks these guys bring unwanted attention from the Goverment, IRS and other agencies. They already have a bad image of crypto.
2088 2018-01-26 22:30:22 Bitshares has not been on my radar that often- Im really liking what i'm reading lately.  They seem to have their S$%! together - I like it - will plan a long entry as well - #bitshares $bts #blockchain $bts $btc #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency
2089 2018-01-26 22:29:55 Keep the Crypto tips coming!! 

can I get a follow?
2090 2018-01-26 22:29:54 Why?? The coin will be locked down and unable to withdraw like most POS on cryptopia
2091 2018-01-26 22:29:48 Good news. I hear alot of good things about it!
2092 2018-01-26 22:29:44 ill have someone who is searching for that term mad at me but the jokes on them, even if i invested in crypto and it wasnt a huge scam i'd still find a way to lose money
2093 2018-01-26 22:29:23 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Plateformes Crypto - Comment ça marche? - Partie 1 : ordres d'achat

Ethereum: €831.05
Litecoin: €139.79
2095 2018-01-26 22:28:58 It's only natural that with huge demand of their cards in #Crypto community they will hire someone with actual experience in this field to make their products more adjusted to new application in mining.

2099 2018-01-26 22:28:39 And everybody said crypto would have the blowoff top.

2106 2018-01-26 22:27:54 Name the “7 large banks” you talked to. You are chastising Ripple for not releasing the names of the banks, but you just did the same. Can’t believe how uneducated that guy sounded. One second he says no banks are going to use it then “banks could run with it”. FUD

2113 2018-01-26 22:27:22 Hopefully soon. I think once crypto moves off GPU mining it will be good. Btw do you still play league?
2114 2018-01-26 22:27:21 Than you everyone for the support and feedback. Without you spreading the awareness, these scammers would still be taking $ from those in #crypto. Together, we will expose them & hopefully save people from falling for their scams.

2121 2018-01-26 22:26:54 Crypto has a lot more to offer than people who are good at TA/FA/Signals/etc.  That stuff makes money but it doesn't make crypto.  Give yourself more credit!
2122 2018-01-26 22:26:49 Nahhhh he's right. A rising tide raises all ships; never forget that Bitcoin is the tide.
2123 2018-01-26 22:26:47 Don't be that #crypto noob who Tweets objectively insane predictions based solely on the fact that you purchased the same coin as an OG.

Twitter Shills + Confirmation Bias - DYOR = REKT
2124 2018-01-26 22:26:44 This idea that "noobs" buy cheap coins like $XVG. Because every "noob" is cashed strapped. So many bareass assumptions in #Crypto atm. My older brother is a "noob" yet he's got PLENTY of cash to kick around, when he's damn ready.
2125 2018-01-26 22:26:36 any translation? 
2126 2018-01-26 22:26:16 Conflating 2 different things. Mobile payment infrastructure is behind the curve in the US. Urban Chinese colleagues basically never use cash. But it's all tied to traditional banks & currency. Crypto is another beast.

2132 2018-01-26 22:25:43 A fan of Lightning Network who told me any activity of mine in Bitcoin Cash was going to get me "rekt" also told me how very important it is that we get government officials and banking executives to own cryptocurrencies. Crypto isn't just for smart people anymore.
2133 2018-01-26 22:25:41 Or me lol
2134 2018-01-26 22:25:39 What are your thoughts on buying into ICA now and doing maybe a quick swing?

2137 2018-01-26 22:25:22 Much of the hype around crypto is a result of the little guy tired of being forced out of all the best opportunities due to 'regulations'.

2146 2018-01-26 22:24:38 Same goes with our crypto project: everyone is able to trade their DUBI for Ether right now and see enormous returns (even though we never promised this or are liable if it would not happen) as we assumed would happen. Because we put all the budget we get out of it back in.
2147 2018-01-26 22:24:36 The Bob Ross of crypto strikes again with an amazing piece.
2148 2018-01-26 22:24:31 I like your style 
2149 2018-01-26 22:24:30 Its not unlikely you will be able to set that yourself in a future update :)
2150 2018-01-26 22:24:26 PSA: Be aware of FUD based on the opinions of others in the crypto-space, always DYOR, and base your research off facts.

2151 2018-01-26 22:24:26 正直なところ、今回のコインチェック騒動で新規参入は減少するだろうし仮想通貨への不安感から買いも減る。残念なことに伸び代が減ってしまったかもしれない。だってあんなことが起きると不安だもの。

2153 2018-01-26 22:24:21 Download Robin Hood or invest it in bonds. Don’t be stupid, invest your first hits into actual growth. Unless you know what you doing with crypto, it’s a foolish investment.
2154 2018-01-26 22:24:14 I doubt 5-6% of men even own any crypto.

2156 2018-01-26 22:24:05 You'd love crypto then
2157 2018-01-26 22:23:33 Man if the prices reach this in 2018, I will be rolling. Probably still in my GTI, just for the sake of putting my money away for smarter things but I will drink to this.
2158 2018-01-26 22:23:23 From my roofer to my taxi driver, all discussing #bitcoin and #altcoins. Love this #crypto stuff until they will regulate this as well. Enjoy it while it lasts. $btc
2159 2018-01-26 22:23:22 but I always think it's funny guys having all these thesis about why women are not into computers. Also I don't see that many guys into nursing or public relations and don't see women bitching about it.
2160 2018-01-26 22:23:19 Next big ICO should be for stupid predictions made online, linked to users on the blockchain, and a specific set deadline so we can openly mock fools talking mad ish online. 
Immutability would be really useful here :)
We would use distributed consensus to maximize the mocking.

2170 2018-01-26 22:22:42 I'm sorry but you lose credibility by calling this a P&D coin.  Plz do some research.  One of the only coins with a legit product already on the market.  Not to mention the terrific team, partnerships, and backers.
2171 2018-01-26 22:22:34 Ah yes, I remember the times well. Yes, back in those days when ZRX was but a mere 6000 sats. I'm sure you too, remember the days fondly old friend.

It seems like eons ago... Yet here we are with a 300% return in less than a month from this very call. Crypto is dead. RIP crypto.

2176 2018-01-26 22:22:07 A major hack involving a substantial amount of crypto (as much as %6 of NEM may have been stolen today) means one group can significantly destabilize the currency. A small group holding so much power significantly increases volatility.

2184 2018-01-26 22:21:30 With all due respect you are the one who elected to continue this "exercise of futility" as you call it, when you responded numerous times to my initial comment.

2186 2018-01-26 22:21:23 Stock market is about to crash.. where are they gonna go to make up that money. Gold & Crypto!
2187 2018-01-26 22:21:18 I knew it was inevitable for hackers to take advantage of the untraceable crypto currencies. They’re too vulnerable for someone to invest real money because of the risks involved

2192 2018-01-26 22:20:55 The surge of interest in Robinhood Crypto has brought out skeptics of bitcoin's skyrocketing price and the start-up…

2196 2018-01-26 22:20:41 #TEL can hit the $1 mark. The circulation supply isn’t as high as people think it is due to allocation of coin break down. This will explode.

2198 2018-01-26 22:20:37 What do you think the final outcome here will be? Huge crypto crash?

>500 mil just disappeared from a Japanese exchange and the market didn't even notice.

Tether will be worse?

I'm not disagreeing with you, just wanna hear your take.

2215 2018-01-26 22:19:16 I've got a bag, I was a Ico buyer. I just like that text update
2216 2018-01-26 22:18:59 Hook me up with a follow too.  Big fan and crypto enthusiast.
2217 2018-01-26 22:18:58 My [limited] understanding is that the $38m is the current total of US-only CASH-only transactions. No foreign Cash or crypto - no US crypto
2218 2018-01-26 22:18:57 Sure. Why would you believe in a available product that already works and is being adopted like $XVG? Smh....When people can get past their emotions #Crypto will truly take off.
2219 2018-01-26 22:18:40 Right there with you.. ;)

2225 2018-01-26 22:18:14 Thanks man! Have your posts on alert.
2226 2018-01-26 22:18:09 You dun good professor. But my momma said crypto is always correcting cause they got all those bull runs and no bears to slow em down

2229 2018-01-26 22:18:03 Hey guys I heard #crypto is the next big thing.   should I go all in?
2230 2018-01-26 22:17:50 Ats killed btc. Instead of feeding the market maker we bought trash coins. Money is spread to thin.
2231 2018-01-26 22:17:44 Crypto is pretty unstable.  If you were looking to learn about investing I’d suggest looking into starting a traditional stock portfolio
2232 2018-01-26 22:17:17 Is this recent rise due to cryptopia sorting out their wallets? I thought this coin was dead and buried?
2233 2018-01-26 22:17:13 I’m promoting this to everyone I know that is into crypto.
2234 2018-01-26 22:17:12 And that’s why I won’t be investing my 12 bucks in crypto currencies 
2235 2018-01-26 22:17:09 Coincheck confirmed the theft of $ 532 million
According to official representatives Coin Check, more than $ 532 million was stolen from their trading platform. in the NEM crypto currency.
2236 2018-01-26 22:16:57 @Gramatik ps @iampaulcampbell is trying to throw a crypto panel together for wmc you should probably be in that matrix

2240 2018-01-26 22:16:37 one of the only ones in your portfolio I didn't buy, fabulous lol
2241 2018-01-26 22:16:29 Bank and bank executives keep talking about about how #bitcoin and #crypto can be used in money laundering, fraud and terrorism... Arn't banks and cash the traditional, and most common method to perform these illegal activities?
2242 2018-01-26 22:16:29 Done
2243 2018-01-26 22:16:29 You are listing these women as if I have argued that they don't exist. I have clearly stated my position on more than one occasion now, and not once have I questioned that there are prominent and valued females in the crypto movement. You are baiting.
2244 2018-01-26 22:16:20 史上最大の盗難であっても、史上最大の回収なり、追跡ないし使用不能状態に出来れば、お金の歴史に残る出来事になるかと。

2246 2018-01-26 22:16:17 *utterly disregarding feasibility of market cap and talking out of their a$$*
2247 2018-01-26 22:16:14 If you have to choose between buying #NXT or #ARDR for profit, which one would you go for? Short-Midterm. 

#Crypto
2248 2018-01-26 22:16:09 Yes. So long as you retain your private key (which you should always keep a paper copy of) you can always access your crypto.
2249 2018-01-26 22:16:05 Damm im gonna be a millionaire
2250 2018-01-26 22:15:59 For those who say crypto transaction fees are high. I just paid $75 to transfer $2.5k to a country in Central America. All those opinions are US focused and are missing the ROW opportunity #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #crypto @APompliano
2251 2018-01-26 22:15:55 ? i have Kucoin sorry still pretty noobies do you the api or is there a setting some where on the site?
2252 2018-01-26 22:15:54 Didn’t get it
2253 2018-01-26 22:15:52 @SmartTipps @crypto_rand @CryptoBully  Hey guys, have a look at INS ecosystem. Tokens dropped in on several exchanges including binance over the last few days. This seems like a solid project. Could be a winner.
2254 2018-01-26 22:15:47 You are correct. My tweet however was directed towards Doug who we all understand is brand new to the "community" of Crypto. I could have been more clear to the Twitter audience. The context of my use of the word "community" was in relation to the crypto community as a whole.
2255 2018-01-26 22:15:47 Mm I'd have to agree my fellow Rick

2258 2018-01-26 22:15:36 @RobinhoodApp, will this crypto exchange work outside of the US? Asking because I've always wanted to use Robinhood but I couldn't because I don't have a SS number. Will new users need to have one in order to trade cryptocurrencies?
2259 2018-01-26 22:15:35 It would be good for crypto as a whole if figure heads like you Vinny worked on your own projects and encouraged collaboration in the market as a whole not putting stuff like this damaging the market cap - we all need to work together to get public wide adoption in 2018 onwards
2260 2018-01-26 22:15:31 This isn't anything to do with time allocation nor my own gender. Nor am I debating against the inclusiveness of males or females in crypto. All are free to invest, trade, generate wealth. All who produce wealthy content will be respected in the community. Male or female.
2261 2018-01-26 22:15:24 some great work here
2262 2018-01-26 22:15:22 いくで、やるで、フルレバショートで補填や。
2263 2018-01-26 22:15:19 Just put some ETH into @Moozicore #moozicore I love the idea, great potential. You should look it up! #ico #alts #altcoins #crypto
2264 2018-01-26 22:15:14 $400 million worth of crypto currency stolen? Seriously?

Surprised there is even that much crypto in total.
2265 2018-01-26 22:15:11 :Lol

2267 2018-01-26 22:14:51 Until you can buy crypto through the app this is just testing phase.....but good work so far...
2268 2018-01-26 22:14:48 Het verschil met chartaal geld (waar ik gemakshalve dus giraal onder vat) is dat chartaal geld een min of meer stabiele waarde heeft. Banken kennen het deposito garantiestelsel.. crypto valuta niet, om wat te noemen..
2269 2018-01-26 22:14:46 It would be good for crypto as a whole if figure heads like you Vinny worked on your own projects and encouraged collaboration in the market as a whole not putting stuff like this damaging the market cap - we all need to work together to get public wide adoption in 2018 onwards
2270 2018-01-26 22:14:44 Not exactly. Forward looking bank CEOs could offer #bitcoin & #crypto to their clients and benefit.
2271 2018-01-26 22:14:44 Thanks @CocoXcrypto 
2272 2018-01-26 22:14:37 @crypto_bobby so with all the moves vechain has been making, and the fact that you have increased your position in vechain, it's time to make a vechain video, no?
2273 2018-01-26 22:14:35 Hi Patrick! I've tried to reach you via mail! I'm on the board of a liberal student group in Sweden, and we'd love to have you as a speaker this spring to talk about the impact that blockchain and crypto could have on liberty and the citizen-state relationship. Could we talk?
2274 2018-01-26 22:14:31 Dank je! Ik handel in crypto, maar zal PM eens goed gaan onderzoeken, klinkt interessant!
2275 2018-01-26 22:14:31 Fuego! Hit me up the next time your in town for a show. Seen you at least a half dozen times. 

Come check out the Crypto Castle— last time @datsik was here we geeked out until 7am 
2276 2018-01-26 22:14:30 I think I might have to start a #Crypto account 
2277 2018-01-26 22:13:57 so impressive how people dont understand how outstanding shares, price, and marketcap all relate
2278 2018-01-26 22:13:57 Cheers buddy.  AIM been flat since NY. People chasing crypto. Next week I am expecting  #hyr #vrs #sdx to all be materially higher..fundamentals solid on all three and think they will bag this quarter
2279 2018-01-26 22:13:48 Same as you but only drive one car at the same time, so i just wonder why do you need so many cars? Very pathetic way of spending money.
2280 2018-01-26 22:13:36 My sister has crypto, my girlfriend has crypto, my friend, a girl photographer has crypto, but they're outliers. 

Generally, women are less interested than men in complex technology, economics, financial politics, investing, and gambling.  They are holding themselves back.
2281 2018-01-26 22:13:36 Hahahaha. Mooooonnnn!!
2282 2018-01-26 22:13:33 What about crypto currencies for corruption and siphoning off stolen public money into places and in formats judges will never find, and that the public will never understand if it ever comes to light?
2283 2018-01-26 22:13:31 To the people asking for free crypto:
Never expect something to come from doing nothing.

Coming from a guy that started out by selling phone cases on eBay with less than $100.
2284 2018-01-26 22:13:31 Any suggestions? I use the Robinhood app. Not even sure what all crypto is on there. Ik the have BC, BC cash, BC gold, etc.

2305 2018-01-26 22:11:41 Multinational corporate and political powers thrive on centralization and regulatory management of distrust. How do you see real industry and governmental adoption of decentralized public blockchains and crypto playing out? Can Internet2.0 significantly lift economic freedom?
2306 2018-01-26 22:11:36 btc goes up=alts go down. btc goes down=alts go down. btc holds position=alts go up. variables non shitcoin alts providing ROI and those used for ICO purchases. Keeping making them $$$$$$$$$
2307 2018-01-26 22:11:26 Half a billion dollars lost in crypto  a moment of silence for the people that got hacked
2308 2018-01-26 22:11:18 Yet, there are ways to be smart in this space about what you’re investing into.  I bought #bitcoin 5 years ago, and I go to the right people and places to educate myself in crypto. My advise is to always go to the people who habe been in this the longest. - #Cryptocurrency

2314 2018-01-26 22:10:33 2018 should be a big year for crypto in general, so no doubt we'll see more volume. Normally January is a terrible month for everything, retail, economics, crypto. So going in to later this year, no doubt we'll see it back.
2315 2018-01-26 22:10:33 Or aaap jo crypto currency ka keh rhy ho i'm IT person and i know what is crypto currency...cryptocurrency is a biggest way of corruption ..simply buy bitcoin, xrp, eth and xmr etc and withdraw from other country simply
2316 2018-01-26 22:10:17 Yeah, such a joke that you have it as your pinned tweet come on
2317 2018-01-26 22:10:05 People are envious of those who get ahead, and if you're doing it with crypto, people are even more jealous, watch out!

2326 2018-01-26 22:09:17 That gif hit the nail right in the head when it comes to new crypto investors 
2327 2018-01-26 22:09:09 PC Mastercard here in Canada stopped crypto purchases outright. I found out the hard way when trying to buy the big dip a couple weeks ago.
2328 2018-01-26 22:09:06 But not because they are women. Gender has nothing to do with it.
2329 2018-01-26 22:08:55 If I have learned anything, it is that TA for crypto is bullshit. BTC will keep going down until it’s done going down.

2332 2018-01-26 22:08:41 Thanks for the tag!!!!Great stuff lawrence!!
2333 2018-01-26 22:08:18 Man... crypto is just getting started. Not even close the o being too late. The crypto market is way down right now too. Good time to get in.
2334 2018-01-26 22:08:13 ここはシンプルに ハッキングにあっちゃったね！よくあるよ…

なんで死んでも言えない。

ホットウォレットしてました は同情の余地なし。
2335 2018-01-26 22:08:11 So crypto space unicorn CEO has senior staff try to set up dates for him with female candidates even as senior staff try to set up dates for themselves with same candidates?
2336 2018-01-26 22:08:08 lmao, good one!
2337 2018-01-26 22:07:53 If America is broke its b/c republican tried break it. gov shutdowns entirely their engineering akin to crypto  coup de tat. ; Its reasonable the work of cultivating Cannabis should have a bit of profit but please don't see it as industry first.   #EthnicAmericanStoners
2338 2018-01-26 22:07:38 Of course there are, you think I was arguing that there aren't valued women in this community? You have deliberately missed my point.
2339 2018-01-26 22:07:23 What’s going on? No increase or positive movement yet. Dev please do something, we need to make TER best crypto for 2018, we need the Market
2340 2018-01-26 22:07:01 Further to that there is a huge Asian female presence in advisory roles ,CMO roles, Cco roles etc in many cryptos and icos. Men have a head start as many women didn't use the dark net to buy drugs back in the day. Im sure with effort and willingnes to learn theyl have their place
2341 2018-01-26 22:06:48 Feel weird tweeting this but... #zrx may actually go to the moon. $zrx #jesus #crypto #cryptocurrency #cryptobae
2342 2018-01-26 22:06:45 @CNBCFastMoney - tell Mr crypto he’s in timeout- he’s not aloud to give his opinion until #Crypto picks up lol!
2343 2018-01-26 22:06:37 Really enjoying these twitter polls! How about another one?

WORST trade for Jan 26th is...? (not saying any of these are bad coins)

2345 2018-01-26 22:06:27 So you don't find me sexy 
Maybe I should use my real photo as profile pic. 
2346 2018-01-26 22:06:21 What happens when you have listed every crypto as coin of the week?
2347 2018-01-26 22:06:18 You only have yourself to top. SN is my favorite crypto banger. Though @realytcracker’s “Bitcoin Baron” is a very close second.
2348 2018-01-26 22:06:14 there are no small or big coincidences. there are just coincidences. the timing of this hack seems coincidental.  but one could argue every day is significant in the crypto arena.
2349 2018-01-26 22:06:12 crypto
2350 2018-01-26 22:05:50 If these were equities, it would be an obvious sign of a bubble, but in this case signals a network effect which would make one more bullish on crypto, not less.
2351 2018-01-26 22:05:35 Just bought myself some $BTO. Sometimes you have to try new things out. Anticipating the future with bright optimism. Smells like a sleeping dragon ... Thanks @Crypto_Brahma :) #altcoins
2352 2018-01-26 22:05:29 Thanks, i had to search what that mean :) still learning this TW.
2353 2018-01-26 22:05:24 About?
2354 2018-01-26 22:05:04 it’s better if he leaves crypto and concentrate on something
2355 2018-01-26 22:04:54 They managed to track down the account with the hacked funds and told the exchanges.
2356 2018-01-26 22:04:47 THANKS MR PHILANTHROPIST @bitcoinbegger
2357 2018-01-26 22:04:37 Great news! Best crypto news I've heard all week

2360 2018-01-28 23:59:50 Person who says they have similar views on things had a disagreement with me so they must be lying crypto liberals
2361 2018-01-28 23:59:38 Why do you think $axq is a great entry? Not bashing just curious. What do you know about value they will create? All I see is a generic change of business intentions, not action, to blockchain and crypto. Are you just speculating based on technicals?
2362 2018-01-28 23:59:28 im gonna have to downvote this one. centralized exchanges go against the decentralized vision for crypto. No need for 3rd parties.
2363 2018-01-28 23:59:25 XRP.... more like RIP haha, this is centralised.. And it totally goes against the purpose of cryptocurrency and blockchain tech. it shouldn’t even be on coinmarketcap.. it will fail in the end along with all its gullible investors.
2364 2018-01-28 23:59:22 3) Met a trader today low 30’s is practically set for life 6 figures via Crypto. No way he gets there via Stocks that quick. Ready for your responses...
2365 2018-01-28 23:59:18 What about making almost every company tokenized ( crypto equity ) so you can have new incentives mechanisms for companies?
2366 2018-01-28 23:59:12 Will be pretty funny when $etc starts pumping for the march airdrop and noobs go "Oh No! Why didn't I see this!? Crypto is a scam!"

2392 2018-01-28 23:57:49 No. SCI is a new term. The term was not even invented in 1968. The term was CRYPTO. When *DID* you serve? Can you take a quick shot of YOUR DD-214 with your phone and post it?

Option: Crypto Currencies was NEVER an option before allows anyone to invest $5 and up fractional level.
2399 2018-01-28 23:55:55 I respect you so much. I just got into crypto about 2 months ago and haven't made much recently because of my noob moves. I'm learning slowly but your passion for your coins inspired me so much! I'm ready to make some money by holding coins I believe in no matter what!
2400 2018-01-28 23:55:55 Crypto hipster here, I run a full node just for fun. Come at me bro
2401 2018-01-28 23:55:36 某氏は解決前に自社トークン発行も案として挙げていました。それならばまずは損はしなかったです。
詳しくないので実現可能だったかはわかりませんが、それが可能だったなら顧客に損をさせて金で解決したってことになります。努力は何もありません。
2402 2018-01-28 23:55:33 The fact that Youtube has a gray zone about banning these people and a "no second chances" clause with people who talk about religion should be enough for us to create an alternative
2403 2018-01-28 23:55:25 Peeps are in love with their crypto and they're afraid of their lives if $XRP runs then it'll swallow up the whole pie. It won't. There's a few big winners in this market. But $XRP is a monster.

2407 2018-01-28 23:54:27 No worries..Hold it.  It will get your money back plus profit.. Just hold it ..maybe 2-3 weeks.
2408 2018-01-28 23:54:24 how do you think I'm doing, 12 hours into a crypto binge

any confusing bits, please ask, i'll do my best to clarify!

this post literally came from @charlesarthur asking why what I'd just tweeted was important
2409 2018-01-28 23:54:11 One concern is that by valuing bitcoin in USD and saying whether bitcoin is 'up or down' based on the daily price chart reinforces how much USD matters. How many would go into crypto without the possibility of fiat accumulation? forgive my naivete and thanks for posting.
2410 2018-01-28 23:54:09 Друзья, серьезно, советую присмотреться к #OAX. У @Oax_foundation крутая команда и они, действительно, очень активно работают. Я не Ванга, но думаю, что в течение этого года у монеты может быть серьезный рост.
2411 2018-01-28 23:54:02 Xrp works with the quadrillion dollar market and improves it. People don’t quite understand ripple and XRP until they really take the time to learn. They just reel off all of what others say and take as gospel. They will be the ones that lose out big time.
2412 2018-01-28 23:54:02 Appreciate the breakdown it'll help many to understand how crypto actually works ........

2414 2018-01-28 23:53:50 No, they won't because the crypto markets are already packed with currencies aiming to be the main use. Amazon, Facebook, Starbucks coins would be stupid. They would fail, why invest money pushing a shit-coin when you could adopt a trusted one.
2415 2018-01-28 23:53:39 Might be annoying for a lot of people like yourself because you are already aware of the problems, but many people aren't. I believe he keeps posting stuff, new or redundant, to make sure everyone gets to know that too.
2416 2018-01-28 23:52:03 Burdan girilir mi? Girilmezse nereden girilir? Nereden çıkılır? Ne kadar sürede olur ? Gvt takip eder mi? Hsr böyle düşmeyi nereden öğrendi?
2417 2018-01-28 23:52:00 You're right Rand, I looked like a real beggar tonight when I payed for my 9 course meal of my IOST airdrop munniez.
2418 2018-01-28 23:51:56 ですね。今朝の上げの原因はこれかも知れないです
2419 2018-01-28 23:51:45 We have never watched 1 Trevon James video since we started Crypto. By the title of his videos, just seemed like a materialistic shady guy. Not surprised with the entire Bitconnect scandal he was (probably) involved in.
2420 2018-01-28 23:51:36 It can 50x this 2018
2421 2018-01-28 23:51:24 Or Starbucks wants to make their own crypto. Which would have much more exposure than Litecoin. I’m a Litecoin fan, but, big companies are going to start making their own.... #starcoin haha
2422 2018-01-28 23:51:22 3) Crypto is another option that is mostly not controlled by traditional investors or banks. Freedom to invest $1,000 or a kid in Uganda investing $5. This levels the investing playing fields. Similar to poker except you can’t directly outbid someone to force them out of game.
2423 2018-01-28 23:51:20 Yaya I know.  But still.  He's constant yammering and redundancy is annoying.
2424 2018-01-28 23:51:12 Thanks- regarding Crypto, it seems a bit of a minefield . Take ITC as mentioned- do you have to transfer BTC from Coinbase say to Huobi (few exchanges sell it)  to then purchase ITC there and then store on a wallet and not on an exchange? 
Is this a long term hold?
2425 2018-01-28 23:51:09 #pincoin Community from London, England is poised to become one of the  largest community in the crypto space to that develops advanced  technologies to promote the Sharing Economy 2.0, providing higher  efficiency, speed, less costs, and more values to their users.
2426 2018-01-28 23:50:45 I think bitfinexed has some valid points on the whole Tether case and I haven't been using it since a long time ago. I think Tether could end up badly someday. I won't risk it.
2427 2018-01-28 23:50:39 1月は厳しい闘いだった。
年始に全て一度円に変えておけばというのは、かなり多くの人が思っていることだろう。私にも十分すぎるほどの利益があった。

2430 2018-01-28 23:50:30 What where you expecting up there? A presidential candidate? A football coach? Kim Kardashian? Its crypto and tech geeks, its not movie porn in the making people, its information thats it, not trained public speakers or actors! $btcp
2431 2018-01-28 23:50:13 I’m hoping for a 200x on this one....a lot of news, crypto numbers increasing because of @RobinhoodApp, releases, etc!  #moon 
2432 2018-01-28 23:50:11 Depends on your definition of "out in the open". In the case of every coin I listed , the "pop" was never due to an influx of new adopters to crypto.
2433 2018-01-28 23:49:55 250 $BWK minimum. I’m not sure I’m comfortable trusting other people with my coins. Cool idea idea though

2438 2018-01-28 23:49:40 The MC and Coin supply is INSANE I rather spent the money on ST great projects like $GVT then to throw money in Ripple which goes AGAINST what this market is about. You blood suckers don't care, you just want profits lol
2439 2018-01-28 23:49:38 If anyone gives X amount of ANY crypto hoping to get back XXX amount of crypto, then you realise you were cheated, well then it’s your own damn fault. No such thing as free lunch, that’s life. #xrp #ripple

2443 2018-01-28 23:48:39 I think its safe to say you have your wish. Financial institutions buying and selling #Crypto via ETF's / xRapid and other entry point will not change the intent, they are just another participant - good luck to them x
2444 2018-01-28 23:48:33 Same here. I keep buying. Never bought over .07. Our day will come.
2445 2018-01-28 23:48:30 Thank you for your honest approach when you are analyzing the crypto market. I am not fan of any coins and I don’t get emotional when I invest. Please keep up the good work. We need to go for excellent projects... that’s it.

2457 2018-01-28 23:46:58 It’s a solid asset solving real world problems. It will still get the trillions but huge profits can be made without them.
2458 2018-01-28 23:46:46 There is enough room to grow. Very promising team. I'm expecting top 40 marketcap on mid term and top 25 longer term.

2465 2018-01-28 23:45:49 I do ... @OddStockTrader is my Chief Crypto Monitoring Officer ... I'm on his premium text alerts for top and bottom calls
2466 2018-01-28 23:45:34 Soooo @Wendys very clever.. trying to advertise the Spicy Chicken and 4for4 separately to increase revenue. Just combine and make crypto numbers!! If this tweet gets retweeted 44,000 times put the spicy chicken in the 4for4!! Thanks #wendys #4for4
2467 2018-01-28 23:45:34 1) The original intent of Crypto Currencies was to not be controlled and operate for the most part by itself aka Blockchain Distributed Ledger. The only items I and many agree with is voting for soft/ hard forks and security updates via the DAO.
2468 2018-01-28 23:45:33 Ah ok. Pepe is generally just used by trolls, which as you know have a large overlap with Crypto, so those that get offended at anything picked up on him as a symbol of alt right as it gives them something to attack in their own meme wars.
2469 2018-01-28 23:45:32 Yes of course! I have sent messages to government officials about the Petro Crypto Currency but no reply! This ship will sink!
2470 2018-01-28 23:45:23 $idh は昨日だいぶ下げていたので結局購入してしまったが、さらに下げている。底で拾いたかったが、とりあえずしばらくは放置して上がるのを待つ。
2471 2018-01-28 23:45:20 Its a mindset that crypto attracts to and spreads from there. :)
You are amongst similar minded people to yourself
2472 2018-01-28 23:45:10 Exactly right crypto bear, UNBELIEVABLY PATHETIC.

2480 2018-01-28 23:44:24 I hope you feel better brother!
2481 2018-01-28 23:44:15 BULLS ARE COMING
2482 2018-01-28 23:43:46 Wow. Horrific way to judge basketball talent. Just like crypto, id suggest you DYOR!! Only games that they are getting stats are a side schedule of hand picked games by LaVar. The reason he is able to coach some. It’s not impressive if you’ve done any bit of research.
2483 2018-01-28 23:43:44 You have your opinion. I have mine. Your dgb is good. Xvg is also good. Its your right to shill dgb. But its wrong for attacking others coz we are all in same crypto boat. At least both are not bitconnect. If you still dont agree, then its still our choice.
2484 2018-01-28 23:43:42 cba to buy more crypto tonight , need sleep $ICX (please don't lift off tonight)

2491 2018-01-28 23:43:01 #Crypto community is the best what Internet has to offer. We can give ourselves a round of an applause
2492 2018-01-28 23:42:57 Thinking about crypto in terms of the price/marketing as opposed to the technology is the same as voting for politicians for their personalities over policies. 

Bitconnect and Donald Trump are one in the same.
2493 2018-01-28 23:42:50 It is hard to think of a better metaphor for an abundance-centric financial system than the decentralized nature of Crypto. 

And yet it is being chased and hyped by a scarcity World still attempting to hold onto Power. 

The perfect example of the transition of our time.
2494 2018-01-28 23:42:46 Look into $ETC. A huge event coming up at the start of March called an airdrop of tokens for a new chain the devs have been building. It's a 4-5 week hold but is likely to do a x2. Patience is needed, crypto is usually short term sighted so get in a month earlier with this 1!
2495 2018-01-28 23:42:23 Secure Compartmented Information (SCI) is the current term for what was, in 1968, CRYPTO. Just to be in a room with the encryption/decryption machines you had to have a CRYPTO clearance, whether you touched them or not.

2514 2018-01-28 23:39:56 small world, I litterally started following @naval yesterday after finding him in crypto discussion threads and 1/2 way through listening to his latest podcast interview :)
2515 2018-01-28 23:39:50 Yeah thought the same thing.... Oh wow you can send crypto across the world in a few minutes? Wait people can see how much money I have in my wallet?
2516 2018-01-28 23:39:49 yes i know Pepe is a crypto thing, I didn't think it was an alt right thing
2517 2018-01-28 23:39:49 No confirmation of 20%. Total supply burn? Yes that’s true. I’m hoping for wayyy higher than 20%. It has to be higher.
2518 2018-01-28 23:39:42 Lame. It has to be a vape pen that hacks other vape pens in the area via the vapor and then infiltrates the owners' laptops by the USB charging cable and makes them mine crypto for you.

2523 2018-01-28 23:39:11 Listen, $Crypto traders, I'm not saying you should dump your significant other. All I'm saying is that I've been single for a month and my portfolio has 30x'ed

2544 2018-01-28 23:36:03 #Bcash all paid propaganda shows how desperate Roger is.  #Bcash is not even a good Alt coin, so many other Alt's are used more then the #BCASH scam in the amount of real transactions.  #Bcash scam will collapse soon like #bitconnect scam did.

2547 2018-01-28 23:35:59 The conference just started.  The panic was caused by false rumors that the big announcement wasn't actually big.  Whales cleaning up today.

2600 2018-01-28 23:28:34 Well if all goes the way people are talking this will be the Crypto/Iron capital of NL ;)
2601 2018-01-28 23:28:31 You are into CRYPTO? (CRYPTOCurrency, that is)
2602 2018-01-28 23:28:30 Funny, hardly hear people in crypto support trump, if they are,to scared to admit it cause they would lose followers
2603 2018-01-28 23:28:28 Xrp has pretty good chances to become first global accepted crypto asset (currency). Bitcoin has problems with obscurity of protocol and centralization. LN is just patch on a broken system and it won't heal it, not in the real sense. The rest is just dust in the wind.
2604 2018-01-28 23:28:27 oh so nice to see that the crypto markets are settling again after the flushing out of the last 2 weeks. nice bottom formed  now off we go

2616 2018-01-28 23:26:58 Some people wait weeks and others are checked in a few days. You should set out your verification policy. Communication lacking clarity! I've never met a company that did not care about that much dissatisfied customer. Crypto exchange has really became a better biz than banks!

2623 2018-01-28 23:26:20 True considering I'd just get 1 entry per referral and they could get more when they do the tasks, therefore making my odds actually smaller despite having more entries. But no problem, just sharing the love :)

2648 2018-01-28 23:23:40 The point was to introduce $BTCP to businesses, most who are likely completely new to crypto in general. So you're annoyed the conference is doing exactly what it was intended to be?
2649 2018-01-28 23:23:39 At least i can rest for 3 weeks while i let $ICX do it’s thing.  Get in now, weeks of growth to go!  #Crypto #cryptocurrency #BTC
2650 2018-01-28 23:23:17 Tron? Best technology on the planet? Most partnerships in a decade...only crypto not moving in top 35 cryptos. Matter of fact down 4%. Losing faith quickly.
2651 2018-01-28 23:23:06 Just like the best Google people joined Google once search was "saturated", the best crypto people may join once things mature on the product side. They'll be joining to build *the company* leveraging a specific breakthrough (a-la-page rank algorithm).

2721 2018-01-28 23:14:55 "They just launched!" But thats the point. A bunch of people are acting like they have a product when there is no evidence.

If you watch the youtube interview with the CEO he makes some pretty ridiculous claims. Some are either unverifiable or verifiably false.

2730 2018-01-28 23:13:59 I do not compare both products. Products are not the subject. The fact is, if people would be interested in products, in general in crypto, there should be a lot more good coins that would succed. And there is a big chance that ocn will not please them fast enough.

2739 2018-01-28 23:13:19 What data? Most of us gave DOB, Name, Phone # 
Unless you're a bot or gave false information, they already have that

2743 2018-01-28 23:13:00 @stephendpalley interested in your legal opinion. I know in advertising there is such a thing as "puffery" but is it legal for any crypto to make the claim #Monetas does without any evidence? "Monetas — the world's most advanced transaction platform" - seems questionable to me
2744 2018-01-28 23:12:56 I agree, I mean look at one of the biggest hack last here with Equifax. Hmmm.

2754 2018-01-28 23:12:05 @oxfina are not scammers. CRYPTOPIA paused the LTC market. How is that @oxfina fault? Crypto community love to point the finger. @oxfina to the moon!!!!
2755 2018-01-28 23:11:50 Go to What to mine. they stay up on market rates NH is alway lagging on market rate.
2756 2018-01-28 23:11:50 Icon has no product. Their is no evidence to support that they actually have a product. The mainnet launch is not their product. It is just the backbone.

Their ChainID app is a lie so far. It does not work. Even though it "launched" in October.

2758 2018-01-28 23:11:47 Everyone laughed when I talked about crypto. Then it bought me a car and made me more money then I have had in my entire life and now people want to know how they can get in on it. Life is funny like that
2759 2018-01-28 23:11:31 $LTC.X finally some movement in crypto!
2760 2018-01-28 23:11:24 Legitimate question not trying to FUD but I thought pay does not have a functional card anymore because of wave crest?

2779 2018-01-28 23:09:28 And! The way it happened with Trump was posts that helped him were boosted hundreds of thousands of times by bots which is why we need to verify there's real people behind each account, you're making my argument for me

2781 2018-01-28 23:09:22 $ETH at 6 month high against $BTC. Again, these two you need to hold as a significant % of your portfolio, and probably in equal proportion. #Crypto

2787 2018-01-28 23:08:48 "It's still inning two for decentralized protocol, smart contract enabled innovation." — Agree fully with this! 

[Ethereum ⊆ SmartContractPlatforms ⊆ Blockchain/Crypto ⊆ Tech] ...is eating the world.
2788 2018-01-28 23:08:33 That looks like Bitcoin profits rather than hashpower.  If your talking about bitcoin profits, you should only be making .00141 based on todays difficulty.  Next week that should be less.  Nature of crypto.  Otherwise we would be printing monopoly money :).
2789 2018-01-28 23:08:24 Latest one I can think of that had most of those covered was BIS. I’m guessing BCO may have been a candidate too. XBY actually nailed all of them.

2797 2018-01-28 23:07:23 Hmm. He's President. And Twitter didn't elect him

Korea is coming back online & the U.S. is finally going to get some more exchanges for buying and selling crypto like Robinhood & Coinsquare. Goldman Sachs coming online in summer 18 may blow the lid off crypto.

2816 2018-01-28 23:05:43 I must say, I owe the head start on #crypto to DPR making the deep web hit the news
2817 2018-01-28 23:05:33 How to make a BILLION in crypto in 12 months.
1. Go full legit alternative to tether.
2. Have fast AF gateway to buy/sell it from/to fiat only.
3. Keep fees as close to 0 as possible.
3. Full transparency (lifestream account balances).
4. Safely leverage TF out of that account.
2818 2018-01-28 23:05:32 BTC will never be less then the top of the crypto charts BUT BCH is the way forward in my opinion.
2819 2018-01-28 23:05:26 Selling!? One of the only crypto coins with an actual working product?? Lol well... They must be noobs
2820 2018-01-28 23:05:10 Languages are decentralized. The meaning of "crypto" can be expanded as long as the majority agrees on it.
2821 2018-01-28 23:05:06 The top 30 on coinmarketcap is just depressing. #shitcoins
2822 2018-01-28 23:05:02 If the news is a fully baked white paper, shit I’m excited about it, that way it’s open to the public exactly why $BTCP should be worth more than $BCH.

2827 2018-01-28 23:04:37 Also, what happens when someone steals anothers identity and then tweets the wrong thing to get the real person in trouble?

2834 2018-01-28 23:03:51 By which mechanism do you suggest that this be done?  Should people send in photos of their ID?  Maybe birth certificate?  What about people that don't have ID's?

2840 2018-01-28 23:03:29 How to win more in crypto:
 Practice patience... trade less
 Realize your profits
 Let the trade come to you
 Pay attention to volume
 Zoom out! Spend less time looking at the 1H..
 Always have spare BTC or fiat. You want to be ready when the market takes a dip

2854 2018-01-28 23:01:56 Don't worry. Robinhood will take their business soon.

2883 2018-01-28 22:59:46 Because the key is people volunteer to be on Twitter or any social media and most use their real info so literally billions of people are already at risk, it's up to them to protect themselves, tell us all how that changes?

2892 2018-01-28 22:59:21 Hi Mr. Charlie lee . Question here. what do you think about the possible rise of quantum computers and do they pose a security risk to crypto currencies. Would you invest in quantum coins like QRL?
2893 2018-01-28 22:59:21 This

2897 2018-01-28 22:59:00 Excellent idea
2898 2018-01-28 22:58:56 I should make Lambocoin
2899 2018-01-28 22:58:56 This whole line of reasoning is Bullshit. All he was saying is that accounts need to have a person behind them, not a computer bot pretending to be a person, skewing numbers and shaping peoples thoughts. Next thing you’ll be telling us is that bots are people.
2900 2018-01-28 22:58:55 I think the tech advances could be v.good for TRX.
Justin is battling hard for his crypto baby, fair play to him.
A new generation of hot new game changing cryptos are just emerging and I can only see that expanding. Everything evolves.

2903 2018-01-28 22:58:25 It’s hard to fault that logic. And so it’s a damn shame that faulty logic hasn’t averted one crypto currency launch so far.
2904 2018-01-28 22:58:25 Great
2905 2018-01-28 22:58:19 YESSS.
2906 2018-01-28 22:58:18 Every crypto tweet I see in Twitter search is about a "giveaway" if you follow/retweet. Seems legit.
2907 2018-01-28 22:58:17 Sounds puffectly rational to me.  However I am a madman and over-tired.  Let's go deeper.  @RichardGarriott is a huge crypto advocate.  Cinnabons are huge in #UDIC. Now it doesn't sound like this will make any money or be a good marketing campaign, but it seems so right to me!

2920 2018-01-28 22:57:22 What exactly is the problem with verifying that every account belongs to a human being? And not allowing "bot accounts"? Or at least TRYING to do that. If you choose to be on social media, you pretty much are giving up a modicum of privacy.
2921 2018-01-28 22:57:04 Bought some more $DRGN
2922 2018-01-28 22:56:56 Don’t matter what BTC is to fiat BTC is equal to 1 it only matters how much BTC your alt coin is worth .  Why cash out when everyone will use crypto and they need a set currency to be world wide with the same value anywhere and that will be BTC
2923 2018-01-28 22:56:51 Terrible crypto
2924 2018-01-28 22:56:49 most alts don't trade in USD pairs so giving the % change in USD doesn't make any sense. most of that change is due to $BTC being down over 30% during that time
2925 2018-01-28 22:56:41 It’s Easy just to keep issuing Tether out thin air !!
2926 2018-01-28 22:56:40 If you can logically compel me to believe or empirically prove 1 life is put at risk by what @mcuban or I suggested anywhere in this thread, dude I'm on your side

To repeat: Twitter should verify a human being is behind each account

Smart people will always win upon stupid in power, it just takes time and strategy as the dumb are instant
2938 2018-01-28 22:54:36 This seems like the year that a ton of celebrities will get in on crypto.
2939 2018-01-28 22:54:29 Fundamental analysis is best for those that want to just invest their $money into $crypto and forget about it, because even if the market is volatile, in the end only the coins with real value will survive.
2940 2018-01-28 22:54:18 That’s what i been saying BTC is like gold and BCH is how u spend like cash the name says it all ! Bitcoin for HOLDING BCH for SPENDING .  People don’t go around spending gold they spend cash . Even when cash was backed by gold .  It just like all crypto should be backed by BTC
2941 2018-01-28 22:54:18 I saw it creeping up slowly, but it was in the red so probably didn’t catch people attention

2950 2018-01-28 22:53:11 Watch for videos like this at every Bitcoin conf across the globe in 2018. Millionaire crypto nerds with no sense of opsec getting blackbagged and tossed into vans to extract coins from their hot wallets.
2951 2018-01-28 22:53:09 Sorry, what exactly is that implication??
2952 2018-01-28 22:53:08 Shit, I was thinking about getting some crypto logos tattooed all over my arms..... 
2953 2018-01-28 22:53:07 Say No? Fine, but it is illogical to conclude:
-info will be unprotected
-info will be public
-info will be stolen
-info will be used w mal intent
So trying to use the worst possible result from any of that--somenody will be killed for what they tweeted--is a horrible argument...
2954 2018-01-28 22:52:24 I'm pretty sure that between my location, my email address, my phone number, my birthdate AND my gender, they could pretty much figure out if I'm a real person or not. It's right there on my account. No gathering necessary. They could verify it at any time, and may have already.
2955 2018-01-28 22:52:18 You a hater, because your life is going nowhere. You're  just a clown who thinks he knows about crypto currency.

2960 2018-01-28 22:51:58 I cant control what twitter and facebook do with my info. If they store any of the info on their server its now a liability as people can now get access to that info. Also no one built a strawman argument against you, but you just called someone a bot.

2986 2018-01-28 22:48:44 So what's your answer to when China legally demands the identities of state-critical accounts?  Or when Lèse majesté is invoked in Thailand?  Twitter is beholden to the shareholder, not the individual user.  They will comply.  Vetting will lead to censorship.
2987 2018-01-28 22:48:26 Well what do you mean by a Crypto mining Series? Like just a update on the whole scenario or like a how to..? Either way I think I’ll be fine with it

0 Yes
1 No
2994 2018-01-28 22:47:44 TRX has the biggest unsubstantiated hype, but XRP is the biggest threat to crypto's philosophy, no doubt.
2995 2018-01-28 22:47:43 Looks pretty good. I've been away. Going to look at charts shortly.
2996 2018-01-28 22:47:37 No, just install a news app on your phone and you will get your daily information.
2997 2018-01-28 22:47:36 TRX is still very young compared to other coins. This coin will grow exponentially once China adopts crypto. @justinsuntron has the right connections to make this coin huge!! Just wait for web 4.0.

3000 2018-01-28 22:47:32 There's nothing more cool in whole world. #Crypto is the only money allowing you, as its owner, to have full control over it. Without watchful eye of third parties.
3001 2018-01-28 22:47:24 In a normal world yes. This crypto thing is a whole a new world. Ripple has established themselves and their services while Visa will need to spend quite some time creating a ripple like service.

3036 2018-01-28 22:42:07 Actually watched yesterday for the first time. Loved it!
3037 2018-01-28 22:41:59 If I only knew what I know now
3038 2018-01-28 22:41:52 
3039 2018-01-28 22:41:45 Exactly, and nobody is saying they want Twitter to share personal information, it's simply a discussion of whether or not they should verify
3040 2018-01-28 22:41:43 Im also really trying to understand those strong emotions. Many ppl in the crypto space dont think that XRP earns a place here, because its not following the Satoshi principles of decentralisation “enough”. So What, Whats the Big deal?
3041 2018-01-28 22:41:24 too right.. there are too many critics who dont understand what ripple is about. its the only crypto with a defined real life use.  with the backing and team they have they will prove every doubter wrong!
3042 2018-01-28 22:41:17 No, they don’t. Not for crypto. They are only insured for 2%-3% of their cold wallet storage. That’s practically nothing.
3043 2018-01-28 22:41:12 haha, just trying to raise awareness on a project that I personally find really innovative and that the crypto community is not really aware of. There are projects that are worth nothing from a tech perspective and get more attention. But if you want I edit and delete your name
3044 2018-01-28 22:41:08 Robinhood app to sell crypto without fees!  Yes!
3045 2018-01-28 22:41:05 Btw it's easier to stay with both feet on the ground. Or do you feel yourself this up side down after one week crypto? :-)
3046 2018-01-28 22:40:44 why aren't more talking about the fact that @ethereum has separated itself from the pack and has quietly held its value when everything else was bleeding? if I had to bet on any #crypto in the next few weeks/months/years, its #ETH all the way!!!
3047 2018-01-28 22:40:43 Some interesting price action going on here before the $ZCL announcement..... its going to be interesting to see if more than just the fork date comes out of this and how that impacts the price.  Popcorn ready!  #Altcoins #crypto
3048 2018-01-28 22:40:30 #Tether $usdt is the scariest thing since MT Gox
3049 2018-01-28 22:40:10 If I send the 0.1 ETH but missed the first 20, what will you do? I hope you'll pay back my 0.1 ETH ?
3050 2018-01-28 22:40:01 Be pretty cool if someone says bitcoin at the Grammys tonight
3051 2018-01-28 22:40:00 Your tweets can be private. As long as you aren’t threatening anybody or using your account for criminal activity you shouldn’t fear voicing your opinions. Now, hiding behind fake profiles to disseminate hate needs to stop.

3055 2018-01-28 22:39:20 Legit exciting to see a strong southern girl thats honest, down to earth and, greatly involved in crypto.
Hats off to ya!
3056 2018-01-28 22:39:19 Crypto could be in a bubble - BUT - what if it's not? What if it's really just starting? Tax bonuses could lift millions out of poverty.

3058 2018-01-28 22:38:11 Using the word 'bitcoin' is a marketing mistake made by the bitcoin Cash team . The fondamentals are great but they divise the crypto world
3059 2018-01-28 22:38:03 CRYPTO-monnaie donc par logique oui mais ...
3060 2018-01-28 22:38:03 I mean if the news is terrible realistically sub 900k sats is possible
3061 2018-01-28 22:37:55 I'll go down fighting if you call $btc and $eth "crypto". They're "altcoin" if you must be brief.
3062 2018-01-28 22:37:42 I am talking about the instant buy limit (2k). People who have signed up more recently don't even have my limit level yet. Takes time and usage / activity it seems. I assume you were in before June last year? Otherwise might be because you are in the US.
3063 2018-01-28 22:37:30 I'm back in at 6k sats
3064 2018-01-28 22:37:27 Great to see LTC on Robin Hood, I am really interested in following this next phase of crypto currencies, it would be worth considering Digibyte. 5 algorithms and its own fully functioning blockchain. Huge supply still to be mined. Years in creation with a young educated team.
3065 2018-01-28 22:37:27 The one where Apple refused to comply?
Hey for anyone here, I don't advocate sharing your information everywhere, or minimize any dangers of it being stored online

I just happen to agree that social media should have a way to verify a real person is behind an account
3066 2018-01-28 22:37:26 What's everyone's top 3 ICO picks for Q1/Q2?

#Crypto #Blockchain #ICO $ETH
3067 2018-01-28 22:37:06 1.11$ don't recall sats lol
3068 2018-01-28 22:37:04 What price is that? $0.04?
3069 2018-01-28 22:37:03 What are your thoughts on Robinhood adding crypto soon?
3070 2018-01-28 22:37:03 END THIS NONSENSE OF CALLING CRYPTOCURRENCIES #crypto!
3071 2018-01-28 22:37:01 With the strong price action (especially in Ethereum), the Robin Hood announcement, and some other bits, it really would be hilarious IF the top was NOT in, for crypto.
3072 2018-01-28 22:37:01 If you think that dump is bad you will be shocked if the announcement is bad
3073 2018-01-28 22:37:00 A promising project ! Interesting project for investment ! Quickly ! #PORNX #PORN_coin #ICO #Blockchain #cryptocurrency #Crypto
3074 2018-01-28 22:37:00 I will never recommend someone to enter the crypto space just because they want to double their money in the next six months. This is a very long-term game, and there is a lot of effort to put in and a very long learning curve as well.
3075 2018-01-28 22:36:39 What was your entry point?
3076 2018-01-28 22:36:32 It has never been at its true value. $LTC
3077 2018-01-28 22:36:29 It’s already begun, but one of the major narratives in 2018 will be start ups losing talent to newly minted crypto millionaires.
3078 2018-01-28 22:36:09 @mikojava Woah blast from the past!  I see you've done very well in the world of Crypto.  Havent seen you since Okemos High days... Hope things are well!
3079 2018-01-28 22:35:43 @eToro are developing a wallet...
3080 2018-01-28 22:35:41 Great article like Ripple’s approach and strategy. In Aust. I have noted how our Reserve Bank and all the major Aussie Banks have been developing better faster payment systems over past 4/5 yrs. cost multi $milns. But Ripple have already done it. Aust. mint 4 crypto gold as well!
3081 2018-01-28 22:35:41 @RTRamdath Hope see people keep buying PAC. It seems the future will hold tremendous value in PAC seeing new avenues to grow in use within the crypto community and for everyday purchasing, etc.
3082 2018-01-28 22:35:37 I wouldn't mess with crypto expert here ice he's a big deal..
3083 2018-01-28 22:35:37 
3084 2018-01-28 22:35:32 Yes, definitely. In crypto especially the ones that offer free coins to get there name out there must pay for these coins from somewhere! It won’t come from thin air. I Expect a pump to 20 cents still. I feel very confident.

3093 2018-01-28 22:34:26 I get that, I am not arguing that, what you don't get is gathering that data and sharing that data are different things, also someone hacking that data is illegal, and also YOU AND ALL OF US ALREADY HAVE DATA STORED SOMEWHERE ONLINE
3094 2018-01-28 22:34:19 My theory-LiteCoin holders started selling hearing he had sold all his. So he caused, not timed, the top. 
Other Crypto holders then started repricing 'whale sale risk' pushing down prices across crypto complex.
3095 2018-01-28 22:34:17 2000 is really low that would be 10x on binance and the price doesn't jump around. You actually have time to think.
3096 2018-01-28 22:34:03 How can I get started with crypto?
3097 2018-01-28 22:34:01 That article contains some nonsense.  All futures contracts MUST have an EQUAL number of short contracts vs. long contracts.
3098 2018-01-28 22:33:48 You're only going to disappoint yourself with this kind of limited outlook... 2018 is going to make 2017 look like 2013.... lolz
3099 2018-01-28 22:33:47 How does the 50% annual reward rate work?
3100 2018-01-28 22:33:46 It’s cuz they all seeing “overnight millionaires” on twitter forgetting the years of horizontal movement.
3101 2018-01-28 22:33:41 I don't think it was the same dude... Seems more like the FUD was used from whale to pop some stop loss orders... And then they filled their bags cheap up again...
3102 2018-01-28 22:33:23 Interested
3103 2018-01-28 22:33:17 Seriously people don't you have better things to do than to spread fud around? Do you have such tiny dicks that you feel the need to attack others? get your shit together, get help if necessary and get your shit together. Spread love not fud! $btc $crypto $alts
3104 2018-01-28 22:33:17 Thank you so much for the kind words Derek! I am looking for opportunities in the crypto sphere, for the moment with side projects.
3105 2018-01-28 22:33:13 Dgb yes
3106 2018-01-28 22:33:05 I just love the crypto future. The old generation is sceptical anout it but I think, No, I know crypto will be The payment of the younger generation. You can say I’m bullish about the future!

3114 2018-01-28 22:32:32 I’ve been trying to talk my fellow Jackbox Games staffers into launching our own crypto currency. It’s not going well. Somehow, “Bidiot Coin” isn’t capturing the imagination.  What would you call it?

3121 2018-01-28 22:32:16 I don't know if countries were founded on 19 year old kids telling people to buy Tron and Paccoin at ATH's tho 
3122 2018-01-28 22:32:07 Seriously, Im not all a fan of hype. But this coin is really undervalued. I am into crypto a long time now and I'venever seen transaction so fast like this one! It is the most non-cancerous community I have ever seen, it is almost scary how positive everyone is! Bought 10 million

3129 2018-01-28 22:30:50 Do you not think that #crypto has a role as an enhancer of customer loyalty for big brands if tokens were issued to allow the fungibility of reward points?

3131 2018-01-28 22:30:24 Honest question: is crypto about the technology or the outsized returns?

Thought exercise: take your favorite technology, now give the coin to everyone in the world pro rata. would it be successfully adopted?
3132 2018-01-28 22:30:15 Thank you @JennyQTa9 for all the truth bombs you dropped today.

3133 2018-01-28 22:30:01 Because on my planet, we take measures to protect our personal info and how much we can be harmed...meanwhile Google search "logical fallacy straw man" but he warned, Google might use what are called "cookies"
Still: verifying a real person is different than sharing the info
3134 2018-01-28 22:29:47 There is the bit I do not understand. Why should I deleverage if my position is no longer in danger of liquidation? Do I pay less funding fee then?

3164 2018-01-28 22:27:19 @justinsuntron is very smart and very well connected. The more companies he gets involved the more demand for this coin. I see this coin as one of the few cryptos that will be approved for trading once new crypto trading regulations in China are released this year.
3165 2018-01-28 22:27:06 Kucoin is looking like my new go to for everything crypto, I invested small amounts on binance & it’s pretty much stuck on the exchange. If it’s too small to trade why was I even allowed to buy in?
3166 2018-01-28 22:26:52 Countries were founded on the sweat/work/knowledge of others.  It’s called capitalism.

3182 2018-01-28 22:25:28 Okay so in reality do you use false information for everything you do on the internet? Your email address? Smartphone things? Your accounts? Is literally zero of that verifiable to see if you are an actual person? Tell me more about reality on your planet
3183 2018-01-28 22:25:00 Bitcoin and Ethereum is a great crypto to invest in!!! Look up one year gains on these it will blow your mind i promise you.  Media does not want people to know this it could disrupt stock market and banks!!
3184 2018-01-28 22:25:00 Weird. You think there's still time to cash in on crypto events? I prefer the picks and shovels game lol
3185 2018-01-28 22:24:53 Most people don't know what "the work is" or how to do it. 
Even if they did read the whitepaper it wouldn't mean much. 
I've ordered my Lambo already, just tell me how to get rich so I can keep up with payments!!!!
3186 2018-01-28 22:24:53 Anyone who has been in crypto for awhile knows that that wasn't a dump not even close

3191 2018-01-28 22:23:57 Crypto market cap got a lot more coins than all forex pairs or stock market shares, anyone can invest in crypto unlike in forex or stocks. Your analysis doesn't take in consideration a lot of variables. Basically it seems good for a comparison but lacks too much things.

3203 2018-01-28 22:22:49 I haven’t been following this crypto but please explain what makes it “on fire”? Trying to learn here. And thanks
3204 2018-01-28 22:22:49 So assuming you're a real person, you put fake information in your account? A fake name? I didn't, and I realize that someone may be able to obtain my name. Oh no! 
That doesn't get us to people A)taking that info B)using it against us
3205 2018-01-28 22:22:49 Why is crypto the ‘most beautiful bubble ever’?  Personally I’d reserve such a phrase for the asset bubbles created by a decade-long, simultaneous, ‘orgiastic’ worldwide QE, courtesy of the world’s Central Banks.

3235 2018-01-28 22:20:02 What is your thoughts about doge and ada and pac in 2018
3236 2018-01-28 22:20:01 This silence is awkward.... LOL
3237 2018-01-28 22:20:01 Crypto is a Russian bot...I hope. If not the US is in big trouble with wackadoodles like her.
3238 2018-01-28 22:19:59 It absolutely amazes me how many people in #crypto think TA does not work. As long as we have people like that investing in this space, there will be a lot of money to be made. Hope all my followers are learning, using it to their advantage and seeing results! $btc #alts
3239 2018-01-28 22:19:57 The exchanges are not run like trading platforms. There are no rules or regulations governing the protection around crypto funds in the UK or the US. I haven’t assumed anything. What I’m saying is development here has to happen - disruption leads to change.
3240 2018-01-28 22:19:52 Crypto for the win! Honestly, given the hype around coins I'd say a few months of 1 crypto video a week and you'd probably earn a good wedge from clueless investors.

3244 2018-01-28 22:19:36 Apparently there is a string of cryptojackers in YouTube ads, forcing your cpu to mine for crypto while watching YouTube. This is all mitigated with a fucking adblocker. Who the hell watches YouTube with ads LOL
3245 2018-01-28 22:19:25 it was originally intended for stocks and etfs, back when the crypto markets you see today were just a gleam in daddy's eye. $SPY = S and P 500 . owning $SPY put options is a short position (betting it goes down).
3246 2018-01-28 22:19:17 ikr!
3247 2018-01-28 22:19:11 And LinkedIn
3248 2018-01-28 22:19:10 Fair enough. Thanks for the responses! You are #1 in the crypto game hands down!
3249 2018-01-28 22:19:06 Been seeing a lot of debate about TA (technical analysis) vs FA (fundamental analysis) lately on my timeline. 

Here's what I do:
-Use FA to identify WHAT to buy
-Use TA to identify WHEN to buy

Imo, the best #crypto traders are the ones that appreciate and utilize both
3250 2018-01-28 22:19:05 I still want it listed >.< but you are correct
3251 2018-01-28 22:18:57 Already been following them all. You got good taste in the crypto world.
3252 2018-01-28 22:18:54 Anything is possible but those kinds of predictions are impossible to make because no one really knows. I do believe we will do 100-200% by the end of the week. IMHO
3253 2018-01-28 22:18:47 Lol...I clicked “it’s legit” as a joke and see it’s the largest response...of this is a true reflection then fucking bailing on this market right now!

3256 2018-01-28 22:17:54 And here I thought crypto Twitter was for sarcastically giving people shit.. Message received, Ill tone it down for you Mr.  #whysoserious
3257 2018-01-28 22:17:44 I hope and believe the bitcoin is not ruined. Some speculators entered, others will eventually be kicked out, but I still believe we're going to see great things being done with crypto.
3258 2018-01-28 22:17:43 Spreadsheet is asking to request permission.
3259 2018-01-28 22:17:39 “The internet enabled the free flow of information, terrifying those who wanted to control communication. #Bitcoin enables the free flow of value, terrifying those who want to control your money.

Generations to come will see it as normal.” @aantonop
3260 2018-01-28 22:17:35 If Robinhood is going to send crypto on another ride up, wouldn’t we have seen Bitcoin react a little more favorably? It’s been flat (relatively speaking) for a while. Wouldn’t current HODLers want to buy more in preparation for the RH users?
3261 2018-01-28 22:17:33 True
3262 2018-01-28 22:17:32 I still don't get why anyone would invest a significant amount of money in a cryptocurrency. Theft is common place and hardly any businesses accept crypto as payment. Why not buy real estate? Start a small business?
3263 2018-01-28 22:17:29 Oi oi oi! Just fuckin with ya. Tell me to gfm but do you have any recommendations for crypto community groups? I’m in Melb? Have acouple of online forums that are good but looking for face to face crypto meet ups.
3264 2018-01-28 22:17:19 You’re taking that to an unrealistic extreme. Just cause crypto and block chain is now a thing does not mean the world will become decentralized, nor should it
3265 2018-01-28 22:17:17 Copy of people asking me my thoughts on RobinHood:

Any competition to current exchanges is good. There's a lot of $crypto exchanges that need a kick up the arse to be incentivized to improve, they've had it easy.

Plus it's another on-ramp into the deep world of #cryptocurrency.
3266 2018-01-28 22:17:14 Looks like Crypto has gotten exciting over the past year, maybe time to start tweeting again :-p

Now they have lost half their value. Keep em or sell and cut my losses?

3272 2018-01-28 22:16:33 Huh? Are we talking crypto mining or real mining? 3-phase makes perfect sense for the latter but hard to think why for the former. In any event, I've built phase converters for running 3-phase machine tools, but really hard to imagine why necessary for a computer.
3273 2018-01-28 22:16:32 Damn may have to cash out on my crypto currency early if I want my Z to be +800 WHP... I think I'll settle for 700+ >.>

"At this time, we don’t allow transfers of your existing cryptocurrency assets into your Robinhood Crypto account."
3296 2018-01-28 22:13:49 I went with the third option: Do other things while crypto is dumping and relax
3297 2018-01-28 22:13:43 No, but we haven't seen multiple tens and hundred million dollar thefts from the likes of online brokerage firms in the past year unlike crypto. Are these platforms willing to insure it? Probably not... Too costly based on recent history of hacking. Your assumptions are flawed.

3303 2018-01-28 22:13:09 I dont think thats a good analogy, hard to see any threat to bankers from cryptos. 

I dont think there is a "hatred' towards crypto, just an awareness from many that its a ponzi, i dont think there is a fear either.
3304 2018-01-28 22:12:59 Yeah, competition is good for 'consumers.' Coinbase has had a monopoly basically for a while.

3326 2018-01-28 22:11:40 Patience young man... these things take time... do you invest regularly?  Nothing goes up continuously bud... price has to reset, find a higher base line support level and then increase again... happens with stocks, forex, crypto, gold, silver, oil etc. another spike will come

3333 2018-01-28 22:10:58 Here is a tip of 2018 that will get your #trading a boost.
Pick your main coin (that you love or want to #HODL 4ever). Play all other coins (as pairs) against it i.e. gas/eth bch/eth eth/btc. Ride their momentums.

3348 2018-01-28 22:09:28 All while blaming it on regulators, why put it on an exchange if thats the case, perfectly content to hold an investment until product is developed.

3362 2018-01-28 22:07:47 Those that want to make illegal kiddie transactions without paying cap gains tax can. The vendors are probably still based in usd anyways. An exchange handling trans is not a true crypto trans. Does bch have a white paper onthe 1000 year plan or is on some Moore's law hope.

3369 2018-01-28 22:07:14 When I hear the likes of May want to tax crypto, its not the tax that bothers me. It's the fact that they won't talk about positive disruption & nurturing a new sector to the global economy. Everything is a threat to these buffoons with no vision or foresight.

3397 2018-01-28 22:04:35 Manufacturers of smart TV's should have crypto mining hidden in their sets, my TV is on all the time and it's connected to the internet. Maybe they already do?
3398 2018-01-28 22:04:33 In the same time, nobody trades in a vacuum chamber, to avoid any influence of external factors. There is an obvious difference between managing the risks and creating the risks.

3401 2018-01-28 22:04:24 My crypto portfolio today though
3402 2018-01-28 22:04:24 And these risks are ALREADY present, if you don't want to take the risk, don't get on Twitter. It's not like the government comes and makes you register
3403 2018-01-28 22:04:19 I am not a Ripple fan at all, but obviously Ripple is the clearest winner. Maybe not to us crypto nerds but its the only coin most normies heard of
3404 2018-01-28 22:04:16 Shut up with your ripple bs

3413 2018-01-28 22:03:48 This is what I said in that tweet: 
 “if $ETC doesn't hit $50 by 20th January, I will give one special person, a lovely bag of crypto from Cryptopia, with a 10-100x potential, who retweets this!” 

Notice the use of “one special person” 
3414 2018-01-28 22:03:45 I'm fine with that as long as it gets rid of you, Russian troll.
3415 2018-01-28 22:03:43 One last thing on this topic (for anyone else reading this other than yourself)... Make sure to pick a coin that has a product you like and believe will succeed. If you are jumping into low volume coins blindly just for quick profits your asking to get #REKT

3418 2018-01-28 22:03:30 First thing I do when people ask me about Bitcoin or crypto is for them to study it before they get into it. Only put in what you don't mind losing. @aantonop explains it the best, so is the best place to start, has many playlists on his youtube account from beginner to advanced.

3454 2018-01-28 22:00:48 Yes. Like everything in crypto: there are highs & lows, which moment would you buy? Think long term.
3455 2018-01-28 22:00:26 Tethers “market cap” is supposed to be solid. Other cryptos are notional value. 

If half of Tether supply is dumped price should be same as now.

3463 2018-01-28 22:00:00 Lets clarify — I did my purchases around 3 PM.
3464 2018-01-28 21:59:52 That was my thoughts aswell although I was on the fence as gains haven’t been too great this month but overall it’s been a pretty bad month for crypto
3465 2018-01-28 21:59:47 are you still into crypto mining, would love to chat more about it
3466 2018-01-28 21:59:46 #airdrop #ico #presale #crypto #airdropalert #freetokens #BIX Awesome!
3467 2018-01-28 21:59:43 Noob spotted
3468 2018-01-28 21:59:43 Didn’t mention ripple at all. JP Morgan has been just about the most anti crypto
3469 2018-01-28 21:59:30 Find the sweetspot. "Top X" video titles filled with fundamental white paper, team, and concept research coupled with technical analysis. Best of both worlds.
3470 2018-01-28 21:59:27 Is Twitter you main way of communicating via social media?
3471 2018-01-28 21:59:25 What’s your opinion on $ xvg  ever going to move or what? Gez

3473 2018-01-28 21:59:16 LOL
3474 2018-01-28 21:59:15 Sure it is possible 
3475 2018-01-28 21:59:10 @AriDavidPaul First - thanks for all the updates, most helpful. For an average retail investor is there any simple way of taking a position on the total crypto market cap in say 12 months time?
3476 2018-01-28 21:59:08 Free market at its best and finest. Don't fix what isn't broken. #Crypto will adapt to changing conditions and demand.
3477 2018-01-28 21:58:48 The Arsenal soccer team organization is now in crypto
3478 2018-01-28 21:58:47 It’s all a scam, am I right? At least until you dump on some unsuspecting plebes and make mad money.
3479 2018-01-28 21:58:46 No way is real estate more risky than crypto. Maybe my thinking is skewed being based in London.
3480 2018-01-28 21:58:45 Hi Litecoin queen. Which week in February it go wild ride ath. Iam new to crypto..I love LITECOIN.waiting for  another dip before buy LTC
3481 2018-01-28 21:58:44 It’s such an I insane project with an insanely awesome team! It’s a guaranteed mooner
3482 2018-01-28 21:58:31 He didn’t run Bitcoin did he. He bought a lot of businesses to do with bitcoin but he didn’t run it or have influence over the core of it. With bcash, he’s all with and wants to bring down bitcoin. He’s a fraud. Seriously don’t ask me what I think of people that defend him
3483 2018-01-28 21:58:30 I do dropshipping, Local Business marketing, air bnb subleasing, mentor entrepreneurs, forex/crypto trading and social media marketing
3484 2018-01-28 21:58:30 Crypto miners. They are killing Everything including the environment.

The raw electricity they use is ridiculous.
3485 2018-01-28 21:58:13 It’s called “aging” you must be over 40!
3486 2018-01-28 21:58:11 @ThetaToken has hit its target of $0.30. A very nice 30% return. This is also a long coin so as we always say, hold long wherever possible! #crypto #cryptocurreny
3487 2018-01-28 21:58:05 I'm still a newbie in the crypto world but if futures came out for ltc would it shoot up like btc did when their futures were opened? Futures would open up a safe guard for business accepting ltc. They'd be able to use their accepted payments to buy a futures contract.
3488 2018-01-28 21:57:57 Crypto ready to breakout again.  Moon inc. leveraged long $btc #crypto
3489 2018-01-28 21:57:57 It's about time
3490 2018-01-28 21:57:50 Some nice volume kicking in for $BTC. Seriously think we have seen the bottom of this correction. I think we will test the 11.7k resistence in the next hour and proceed from there.
3491 2018-01-28 21:57:49 hot chicks
3492 2018-01-28 21:57:37 Please add #Verge ($XVG), The #1 privacy coin in #crypto. Privacy is optional with #WraithProtocol. Smart contracts are also coming with #RSK, stealth smart contracts! And secure messaging through #VISP. The. People want this coin. 

Please consider! 

Thank you @RobinhoodApp
3493 2018-01-28 21:57:33 I love @RobinhoodApp for what they're doing in the crypto space. They've been known to start industry trends (lower fees, etc). Just imagine when @etrade @Fidelity jump on board to compete. Those who think we are in a bubble haven't seen anything yet.
3494 2018-01-28 21:57:31 If my kid decides to hate someone I try and help them learn not to blindly hate. I teach them to keep an eye on the proposed threat and only engage when they are safe and sure they have proof of wrong doing. This way they can be really efficient with time and energy.
3495 2018-01-28 21:57:26 eh mais fácil a gente usar a dado lager como meio de troca do que crypto

3498 2018-01-28 21:57:16 I’m dumbfounded by the amount of lazy, child like noob investors there are in this space. Every telegram channel, every tweet. I’m at the point where I’m just like serves em right to lose all their money.

3508 2018-01-28 21:56:35 It was XRP that motivated me to look at other cryptos that would also already be compliant with regs before they happen. Japan is going to be a safe haven for crypto currencies during the uncertain times to come. I'm also going in on the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange ICO
3509 2018-01-28 21:56:33 You have just made your chances to win a lot smaller...
3510 2018-01-28 21:56:31 Disappointing to hear your opinion on this.
3511 2018-01-28 21:56:31 Good thing you don't know anything about logical arguments, got any more straw men to march out?
3512 2018-01-28 21:56:18 Yep- so what's relevant for your white paper is a)how much of crypto is going into human trafficking rel to cash, b)whether amount in crypto is substitution or in addition & c)traceability of crypto vs cash =>actually better for women?
3513 2018-01-28 21:56:17 Honestly I think it will take a while. Sia is far from ready for user adoption! However I think its one of the coolest projects in the crypto space. And the sia team is full of talented people who I believe will be able to create a good product in the end!
3514 2018-01-28 21:56:16 Diving super deep into #cryptocurrency and #blockchain technology. It has changed my life for the better. Crypto is for everyone. Great sharing #crypto stories and philosophies with @Roni_Rose_ and @G_Rak. Listen for the @Crypto__101 podcast!
3515 2018-01-28 21:56:12 Bc crypto is so new, throwing money into an ico without doing proper individual research can get u worked. This right here is an example. This shit is roulette. Gotta be prepared to lose what u put on the table #nomorebets

3518 2018-01-28 21:55:40 You are one of few that has been transparent in this crazy crypto world.  Keep up the transparency and be speculative bc it’s fun and all will be fine.
3519 2018-01-28 21:55:24 Look at the RoboInvestors like Betterment and Wealthfront.. it's not a zero sum game and the increased competition has led to lower fees and greater incentives for new customers
3520 2018-01-28 21:55:22 You are so so so adorable! Loved the interview  Keep it up 
3521 2018-01-28 21:54:59 Rofl
3522 2018-01-28 21:54:57 Thats cool that #Ripple thinks that they're good.   Good luck selling that shit to a bankasaurus tho.   Those people feel death when they think about #crypto.  I think about Jed McCaleb every time I think about ripple and stellar and that keeps me from buying.
