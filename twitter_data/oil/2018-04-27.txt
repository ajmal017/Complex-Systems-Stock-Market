Your tax cuts were great.
But now, they are been eat up by gas going up close to a dollar a gallon in a month. These OPEC CROOKS need to be held accountable. Also our own oil companies take advantage of the consumer. There is no shortage, and gas should be 2.00 GAL.

During boom years why did they revamp south Instead of an oil fund?
2 2018-04-27 23:59:35 Were you aware that the biggest investors in renewable energy and cleaner technologies are the oil and gas companies?

52 2018-04-27 23:54:54 This is the easiest question in the world to answer. Bankers, oil companies and defense contractors took over control of the CIA and the State department and decided to overthrow every government that would not follow their orders.

59 2018-04-27 23:53:48 Considering the outside countries that would likely be drawn into that conflict, the price of oil could be the least of your concerns.
60 2018-04-27 23:53:39 I see the oil companies already price gouging. It's 2.93 at some gas stations.

72 2018-04-27 23:51:49 Cause they think cars are the only reason why oil is needed. Like planes don't need it

127 2018-04-27 23:44:58 Not really, 5 gallons of oil per tire. Oil in all the plastics, it uses as much energy as a house to charge. Paint, metals and batteries. Where does the energy come from to charge it?

129 2018-04-27 23:44:54 The dollar's value comes from the very firm bid made by the debtors. Every farmer who owes, works hard to dump wheat on the bid. Every oil producers, etc. There is no evidence that they're all ready to allow foreclosure this summer.

155 2018-04-27 23:41:34 Then also ask him to prohibit ALL foreign oil being tanked in, AND to penalize the cities that dump their garbage and sewage into their harbours.  Hypocrisy is a wonderful thing if you’re an soncalled environmentalist.

157 2018-04-27 23:41:25 Can I be your personal oil man 
158 2018-04-27 23:41:18 However oil will remain in dollars and food -I guess - will be in euros.
As we devalue, oil and food will become more expensive.
Interest rates will rise.
Wages will need to rise.
Costs will be cut back, unemployment will rise.
Etc.
We can't devalue much more than we have?

185 2018-04-27 23:36:48 You can never go wrong with oil.
186 2018-04-27 23:36:43 I usually throw them in the pan with a bunch of seasoning and a light spray of oil. Garlic and onions will make a nice addition.
187 2018-04-27 23:36:33 Soooo if anyone is having problems with their car or needs like oil changes tire rotations etc etc. I can hook you up !
188 2018-04-27 23:36:14 That's how it appears. The recession is over and the state's oil companies are making loads of money and they don't want to pay their teachers a living wage.
189 2018-04-27 23:36:13 i’ve saved so many girls lives in the past few months, at a rave i had a tampon in my fanny pack and at the gas station yesterday some girl needed car oil and asked me for change but i actually had the same car oil she needed

191 2018-04-27 23:35:53 Thanks! It really was. I also put olive oil and the reduced juice/fond mixture around it for an added bit of flavor while eating
192 2018-04-27 23:35:53 Probably because it is a bunch of oil companies lol.
193 2018-04-27 23:35:53 Having a car is cool until you need to get an oil change..or an inspection...or a registration sticker...or new breaks...or pay for gas··
194 2018-04-27 23:35:45 My cousin looking for oil to dip his bread in, while we’re out for a family dinner: “Oh. There’s the oil. I was using butter like an AMERICAN.”

We should whine about every preferential idiosyncrasy, yes?
198 2018-04-27 23:35:00 Why no mention of the Governor's Oil & Gas Safety Commission?
199 2018-04-27 23:34:47 An oil change should not take two hours.

201 2018-04-27 23:34:33 You think the oil industry is going to disappear overnight and Canada is saving the environment by not competing with other countries for market share. Not developing our energy sector will not save the world you are the one who believes in fairy tales.

205 2018-04-27 23:34:00 What a stupid, ignorant comment. We want wind and solar power, not oil from anywhere. If anything, it’s the oligarchs like the Koch bros who want the oil. You should have fins and gills, because you fall for that bs hook, line and sinker.
206 2018-04-27 23:33:49 @Valvoline A mechanic in one of your Express Care stores hit on my wife.  Unacceptable behavior.  I’ll be going to a different oil change place from now on.

260 2018-04-27 23:28:01 Attention Rex Manning fans.  To your left you will notice a shoplifter being chased by night manager Lucas.  This young man will be caught, derp fried in a vat of oil and served to our first 100 customers.  Just another tasty trest from the gang at Empire Records
261 2018-04-27 23:27:59 You ever heard of ALEC? The folks who writes laws to be implemented by republicans in Red States funded by Koch’s. Oil companies billionaires. Rights To Work, union killing laws.  Lots of others. Ike warned the people in 1954. Happen now. #Butta
262 2018-04-27 23:27:52 Its because our political leaders of the past 25yrs  have been getting a cut of alllll that oil money by way of foundations; much like planned parenthood recycle 40% of federal funds back to polticians... so too does middleastern oil regimes.

277 2018-04-27 23:24:49 Good point. And also she said that she couldn’t use “watered down white people shampoo” ..neither can I and most people at hotels can’t regardless of their race. The shampoo strips every oil, makes it dry, crunchy. I don’t use it. Easy fix.
278 2018-04-27 23:24:45 Of course the PKK deals in drugs, guns and oil. Standard protocol for terrorists.

Why does PKK terrorize Turkey? Because Turkey is innocent and never hurt any Kurds while their kids watched?

Call out US and Turkey or your anger is hypocritical.

281 2018-04-27 23:24:20 Ain’t that the truth!! I truly believe that the swampiest of the swampiness started when the got to DC! They’d already started in Arkansas and intensified in Washington! Pure SCUM!

 For years, PepsiCo has failed to take the necessary actions to stop exploitative practices in its supply chain. Coming up at PepsiCo’s annual shareholder meeting: demands of Indonesian palm oil workers re ongoing human rights abuses in its associated business operations

302 2018-04-27 23:21:13 No, Vlad is responsible for bribing the North Koreans. Remember the Chinese and Russian ships that delivered oil to North Korea despite any and all sanctions?
303 2018-04-27 23:21:06 Totally how I feel, changed my perspective. It does really feel like I left a very ugly past behind. When I walk across a parking lot, I now notice the oil stains all over the place and am appalled and wonder how we let it go that far.

306 2018-04-27 23:20:44 @atiku I’ve always said oil is not Nigeria’s greatest asset. Our greatest asset is our youth who created Nollywood out of nothing and an entertainment industry that is second to none in Africa.@MBuhari

363 2018-04-27 23:13:15 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
364 2018-04-27 23:13:15 Instead of denying and completely dismissing my statement prove me wrong. Which leaves a higher Carbon footprint importing oil frombhalfway across the globe or refining oil and transporting through pipelines in country. I think you know the answer but just doesnt fit.
365 2018-04-27 23:12:53 I'm from Bakersfield, and it's the Basque food "setup" that baffles me. I mean some components are ok, it's just makes no sense all together: cabbage soup, french fries, spaghetti, oil and vinegar salad AND pickled cow tongue? Random randomness.

380 2018-04-27 23:11:31 Yes, it was a political point ploy.  We don't need to end up as a dead coast in order for oil barons to obtain bigger bank accounts
381 2018-04-27 23:11:21 if been using the granactive before it was renamed to that, tried the new squalane retinoid and I cannot deal with how it feels on my face. It's an oil, almost like a dry pop but it just takes forever to sink into my face. The granactive is an emulsion.
382 2018-04-27 23:10:41 The proportionality clause can be invoked if a government in Canada reduces US access to Canadian oil, natural gas, coal, electricity & refined petroleum products without a corresponding reduction in domestic access to those products. - too bad Ab you are stuck with US discounts.

384 2018-04-27 23:10:29 It will "work the same" by stripping the oils, which is bad for black hair and good/intended for white hair. Damaging my hair by stripping it off the few oils it produces and literally just making yours clean of excess oil is not "the same."
385 2018-04-27 23:10:27 No, supporting “regime change” is supporting terrorists. Ur the dipshit who conflates being against regime change as being “pro Assad”.  Assad being a “dictator” is none of ur business. Or the US gov’s. It’s about the oil pipeline, Dupe. Ur a know-nothing propaganda parrot.

443 2018-04-27 23:00:06 No! Sexual and gender are different !! You can't mix them together it's like water and oil- homosexuality is based on biology- gender is based in the patriarchy- fancy marryvlove who you wish- it's beautiful but don't bastardized the language
444 2018-04-27 23:00:00 Mine is coconut oil and done.
445 2018-04-27 22:59:55 Okay, so like when the lady at the store said my oil change was finished, and I finished my shopping, and it wasn't, I could've said "What an empty bag of nuts!"?
446 2018-04-27 22:59:44 nothing is more astounding than oil paintings. preferably really old. Vermeer to be exact
447 2018-04-27 22:59:32 I’ll come home for Sunday dinners with my pasta oil and garlic
448 2018-04-27 22:59:21 Would the sequel be "I cut it into small slices, drizzled it with olive oil, and toasted it with mozzarella and tomato slices"?
449 2018-04-27 22:59:19 It took long enough. Make sure you do an oil change before your physical. Congrats Bro beans. Haha
450 2018-04-27 22:59:04 It looks like it's smeared in oil haha
451 2018-04-27 22:59:00 Yo I’ve been taking CBD oil for a week now and I’ve noticed how much I’ve changed. Lmao
452 2018-04-27 22:58:54 What kind of oil is that?... Me too I want oil oo, I want to fry fish 
453 2018-04-27 22:58:51 To all of you all studying and trying to get the best out of yourself for your exams, burn that midnight oil.
Your success is around the corner.

454 2018-04-27 22:58:42 Trust. Plantain is like 20x more attractive when it just comes out of the oil.
455 2018-04-27 22:58:37 While the graph gives the date for when the #EU import ban came into effect, EU countries had already cut back their oil from Iran well before then (as shown in the graph)!
456 2018-04-27 22:58:35 Water, air, land will be poisoned, DT is already selling off land that was National Forests and Monuments for Oil Fracking, (destroys water tables). We will be like Flint, Michigan.  All the things that Trump is reversing, is for his hate for Obama.
457 2018-04-27 22:58:20 Too much salt?

We do a mean stir fry at B Towers. Sesame oil, veg, some spices, noodles. No side effects.
458 2018-04-27 22:58:10 Oil.
459 2018-04-27 22:57:57 Does not matter if you are from AB, NL, NS, ON or BC. The current @liberal_party of #Canada would rather put protesters to work than you. By funding jobs for anti oil and gas activists they are telling you activists are more important than you. @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts
460 2018-04-27 22:57:37 Then I use African Pride's Olive Miracle leave in cocktailed with Jamaican Castor Oil to seal it.
461 2018-04-27 22:56:58 Nope, not at all familiar. I did some googling and reading the past few days and then got a Lodge pan from Target. Good reviews, great price, and pre-seasoned. You just have to coat it with oil after every use. I was intimidated before, too, but the desire for good steak won out.
462 2018-04-27 22:56:54 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and Putin can frame Trump as well as his  sourcing, I don't know who the others are.
463 2018-04-27 22:56:29 We the tax payers as Aneurin Bevan envisaged. We would rain in tax dodgers, friends of the Tories. That’s where the big financial hole exists. Then we would charge imperialist nations for our natural resources, water in particular. More essential than oil, precious metals.
464 2018-04-27 22:56:27 Kirkland olive oil and spices. So good, and so much of it for cheap. And, duh. Go at lunch and get a pizza slice and churro.

467 2018-04-27 22:56:17 USA oil companies are still exporting vs keeping it hone and our prices lower.  Don't believe their crap that they can't make money with lower prices, same companies making BILLIONS per quarter in profits,

484 2018-04-27 22:52:57 Y’all it really just took me an hour to drive 4 miles to get an oil change. AN HOUR.
485 2018-04-27 22:52:54 We will continue to need fossil fuels for decades to come. Planes, ships, trains need oil. Canada is a huge cold country and renewables in no way fill our needs. Leaving our oil in the ground doesn't mean we need it less.
486 2018-04-27 22:52:52 I was oil pulling on the drive and spit it out when I got to the bank parking lot. It was... a lot more "spit" than I thought it would be. Did not pull it off as smoothly as I thought I would.

Seriously do you have an oil painting of yourself in your attic slowly aging?
491 2018-04-27 22:52:07 Two UN reporteurs resigned during the sanctions period saying genocide was occurring.  Halladay, von Sponeck resigned in protest as did Burghartd, head of the World Food program. Hallady said the Oil/Food program was inadequate. The post hoc justifications are hollow.

495 2018-04-27 22:51:39 Not a troll.  I'm waiting for you to comment on all the tankers passing by your coastline full of oil.  Heading south.  Your type never mention those.
496 2018-04-27 22:51:31 Yeah, pretty much. A couple more things, the sun rises in the east and drinking motor oil is bad for your health.
497 2018-04-27 22:51:27 The west was quick to act on Assad when he killed his people, why the deafening silence when it comes to Israel, they don’t even have oil.
498 2018-04-27 22:51:21 If it's that much travel, is it really 35k more? That's a lot of gas, miles, tires, oil changes, etc. Maybe not 17500 worth of all that, but just another way to look at it.
499 2018-04-27 22:50:53 Get a cucumber mask that cleans your pores and witch hazel and coco butter oil or coconut oil

510 2018-04-27 22:49:54 @JockCollins immigrants moving to the regions? I've just seen the impact automation has had and continues to have on the US agricultural sector. I guess new settlers could dust and oil robots!

515 2018-04-27 22:49:14 Imagine oil and farming communities filled with Okies, Mexicans, and meth. Yet we live under the thumb of the Bay Area and LA who have all the political power in the state. It's like a cross between Mad Max and Hunger Games. It's awesome.

519 2018-04-27 22:48:53 Thai cucumber salad, yes? Will check it out and make it next time! I've only ever made Japanese style cucumber salad, and am now obsessed with the simple Chinese version, with just salt, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Perfect with a glass of wine on a warm day like today :)
520 2018-04-27 22:48:48 I take an Apple Cider Vinegar with ginger shot with a dash of cayenne pepper. Also eat a spoonful of good quality coconut oil - don’t know why this works but it does...

524 2018-04-27 22:48:07 I need my wisdom teeth out and I feel like if I just gargle with tea tree oil and sage my room this might all go away
525 2018-04-27 22:48:06 The point is not just the financial cost to the oil company for lost product, clean up costs etc, but the costs the environment pays and those living around the spill, the immediate AND long term affects of oil spills on humans, animals, the food we eat and water we drink.
526 2018-04-27 22:47:52 Collins this, #collins that, if collins is a worker in an oil company or a relative to otedola nw,the Nina won't take him as a "negative vibe" money is the key bro!

530 2018-04-27 22:47:19 She said it came like oil spillage.
531 2018-04-27 22:47:05 I'd much prefer to see us develop our oil & gas and other raw resources here, and sell the finished product at premium prices. That's where the jobs and prosperity is, in producing something with what we extract.

541 2018-04-27 22:45:06 Former Pres Adviser for Foreign Affairs Lozada jr. stated the gravity of the diplomatic row with Kuwait; first we lose protection (whatever is left) for the rest of our OFWs, but what he fears more is Kuwait cutting our oil supply...which could trigger an economic crisis.

586 2018-04-27 22:39:16 Son Ladrones porque si cargaste nafta en Oil se quedaban con una parte de la guita. Eso es robar(te)
587 2018-04-27 22:39:12 The problem with a party and its candidates that is so cozy with Wall Street is this: how can banking houses support Democrats and justice issues with one hand, while they can fund investments into weapons, oil, private prisons, etc, with the other?

593 2018-04-27 22:38:05 calculate gas, tolls, time spent, and an oil change. I'll bet it's about the same.

602 2018-04-27 22:37:10 I haven't yet unfollowed the @Interior twitter feed, so I see him sometimes and even on their official channel it seems like his entire job consists only of wearing incongruous hats incorrectly, and razing the west to bare soil for oil.
603 2018-04-27 22:37:07 @edufeiok Lopez podria haber hecho lo que hizo en Oil sin Echegaray?
604 2018-04-27 22:37:02 Disgree. Bolton will start a war, likely with Iran (but NK or any place else will do). War cranks up the price of oil, Putin's #1 need. Warhawks and protectionists in the US play in to Putin's hand.

609 2018-04-27 22:36:15 14 barrels of oil?
610 2018-04-27 22:36:10 Honestly, that looks like something out of Fern Gully. Or maybe the Neverending Story. Those tokens have some Phyrexian Oil or Eldrazi corruption on them...
611 2018-04-27 22:35:55 Oil..if we are so poor then why try to keep us? You claim we are a drain. Isn't it better to let go then?
612 2018-04-27 22:35:51 Perdón...los ordenan detener por haberse robado miles de millones de pesos con Oil, después también son dueños de C5n pero este no es delito, no mientan

618 2018-04-27 22:35:07 Thank you for acknowledging old white men are the problem, heoi ano, isn't it great that our new PM has grabbed them by the balls & said no more oil drilling in Taranaki..woohoo 
619 2018-04-27 22:34:57 I’m just gonna blow my transmission bc no shops I go to can change my oil because they don’t have a lift for lowered cars and my apartment complex doesn’t allow you to work on your car or I’d change it myself at this point
620 2018-04-27 22:34:20 Don’t comb it. Buy that oil and that foam.
621 2018-04-27 22:34:15 To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified. - Isaiah 61:3 NKJV
622 2018-04-27 22:33:49 When are we going to start extracting crude oil from oil sands in Nigeria? Seems like a pretty decent idea.
623 2018-04-27 22:33:48 Remember too, that the oil shipments are competing with grain issues for rail transport which are both western prairie provincial issues.

625 2018-04-27 22:33:13 Social commitments meant I had to bail early on the Oil Rumble and now my feed is 90% Titus gifs and I am furious that I missed that live
626 2018-04-27 22:33:12 Bullshit !!! Xi & Trump work very well together . President Trump leverage trade against China to force them to get on board with North Korea. Trump called MORE Sanctions when China was caught selling oil to North Korea.

627 2018-04-27 22:33:06 #pnpcbc it doesn't really matter if AB/SK oil law is constitutional, 2 weeks without fuel deliveries will cause havoc for B.C, industry, tourism, fuel shortages and runaway prices!! top it off with 2 years for the SC to hear the case and rule
628 2018-04-27 22:32:58 The initial movement of oil by deep sea tanker depends upon a port's shoreline contour and its hydrographic characteristics e.g. depth. If these characteristics cannot be changed or modified, then the size of the oil tanker depends entirely upon a harbor's hydrographic reality.

631 2018-04-27 22:32:41 Now I’m drinking a beer while my dad changes my oil.
632 2018-04-27 22:32:40 Look ahead.. the states clinging to coal, gas and oil will run out and then won't have the capacity to switch to wind and solar. The states that do now will completely destroy them economically. Every use of fossil already hurts the economy #fossilrisks
633 2018-04-27 22:32:26 Who wants to oil me up????
634 2018-04-27 22:32:15 Pike river re-entered? No oil strategy at all just an announcement and another committee to figure out the consequences! Unitec unfunded and no studies done regarding infrastructure etc etc etc This is all just policies with no structure and no timeframes #nzpol #emptypromises
635 2018-04-27 22:31:57 Ever try using CBD oil for that? My friend had lots of attacks and he rarely gets them now if ever.
636 2018-04-27 22:31:54 that plus flax seeds are the best known plant-based source of omega-3 (ALA) not as good as fish oil, but it's an added benefit
637 2018-04-27 22:31:52 How much are you financing oil business now?
638 2018-04-27 22:31:49 Never where the stuff....lots of oil!!!
639 2018-04-27 22:31:47 Just had a completely mindless moment. I put olive oil instead of soap on my dishes while cleaning them and now I have to do it again..
640 2018-04-27 22:31:37 I thought it was peppermint oil?
641 2018-04-27 22:31:36 coconut oil kills fleas, ticks, mites and soothes skin> lauric acid.
642 2018-04-27 22:31:36 Tamanu oil smells fucking weeeeird but this shit is amazing on my skin. 
643 2018-04-27 22:31:14 If I were to become president I would immediately ban the consumption of olives. No reason for those devil balls to exist besides olive oil
644 2018-04-27 22:31:06 ありがとうございます！
645 2018-04-27 22:30:59 To add some flavor to your greens, sauté spinach and kale in olive oil &amp; fresh squeezed orange &amp; lemon juice. Serve with berries &amp; chicken.

650 2018-04-27 22:30:09 Bach flower therapy.. Really good results. I know, I know, it's snake oil.

657 2018-04-27 22:29:12 Isso me lembra uma música do Midnight Oil, Power and the Passion, que retrata a sociedade de consumo em suas várias facetas como o padrão de beleza por exemplo ou o clipe de Eighties, da Banda Killing Joke
658 2018-04-27 22:29:06 I believe advertising had a lot to do with that. And government interference on behalf of oil.

666 2018-04-27 22:27:53 We aren’t transitioning fast enough. And we are so capable of doing so. Scandinavia is ahead of us.

What if there was an oil spill on your land, your farm, affecting your livilyhood, or seeping into your drinking water poisoning you and your family, would you care then?
667 2018-04-27 22:27:44 Good point, but unilateral #sanctions by U.S. for many decades have had very limited effects. #Iranian oil exports only fell sharply with the multilateral sanctions in 2012. 

Also #Trump might offer waivers and exemptions...

675 2018-04-27 22:26:18 That says about as much as we can expect do alone.
As we know, Oil is coming to an end, and we need to be thinking about living without North Sea Oil. Space tech is one way to plug the gap
& to get a good slice in the global economy requires an EU-team effort. Brexit excludes us.

681 2018-04-27 22:25:27 Is the issue the honorary degree or that Suzuki is against oil. If it's about Suzuki getting the degree he would take the "out". If it's about the oil and he doesn't take the "out" then more negativity can continue to be said about him.The people support oil.
682 2018-04-27 22:25:17 Fats are the way to go if you want to cultivate mass. Peanut butter, coconut oil, avocados, nuts and seeds. Just pour some flax seeds and chia seeds into your shake.
683 2018-04-27 22:25:08 @JustinTrudeau This is EXACTLY the reason why BC is so hell bent on your Kinder Morgan "baby". They don't want OUR IRREPLACABLE WATER ruined with spilled oil for the sake of nothing more than PROFIT!!! Elections, elections, elections.

712 2018-04-27 22:20:33 So, you'd rather have mile long freight trains of oil passing through towns and cities throughout the land?  Ask the people of Gogama Ontario how much fun an oil train derailment is.
713 2018-04-27 22:20:30 These evil serpents, owe Syria competition for its destruction due to their illegal regime-change agenda, plus return of all stolen oil revenues.
714 2018-04-27 22:20:23 the nausea was bad yesterday. I could barely walk. I had headaches too but like I said, I've been having reactions to certain meds so I think I had a reaction to the anesthesia. I will look up CBD oil. I feel better today but my face is a bit swollen and my jaw hurts.
715 2018-04-27 22:20:16 during last Friday's OPEC meeting, the cartel suggested it might ease oil output cuts earlier than expected
716 2018-04-27 22:20:15 AZ has a lot of space though its public lands are wanted by cattlemen & mining & oil ventures.  They want to chase out the wild horses from their homes on those lands too!  So the *BLM lies about actual horse pop. numbers in order to place the horses either in kill buyer pens or
717 2018-04-27 22:20:15 I live in there are two large refineries, and have heard that the reason we don't do it is because our oil is twice as volatile as the oil from the desert therefore twice as hard to refine
718 2018-04-27 22:20:07 @PnPCBC one pipeline solution is not to send bitumen to BC. Invest in refinery in Alberta and send cleaner refined oil to BC. Why is this not an option? Someone please explain. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM #NoPipeline
719 2018-04-27 22:20:04 Yeah super short-sighted.. when oil goes up and it will.. they will find themselves caught without models people will want.
720 2018-04-27 22:19:49 When things go bust, big oil puts the squeeze on costs... then when prices rise, profits rise faster during first phase of the cycle.  Profits slow as mgt. relaxes on spending until next downturn (External factors being = ) 30 yr insider observation
721 2018-04-27 22:19:39 Simple solution...support REFERENDUM and immigration disappears. EU. Steals so much oil from Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa that they prefer immigration and support jihadists.

725 2018-04-27 22:19:27 It is a difficult thing to be both rich and weak . Initial extortion of new oil resources was UK air base. Now,the attack helicopters are the extortion of USA. The others are coming soon... I will closely follow this issue. Let’s see what happens...
726 2018-04-27 22:19:17 Just had the lovely surprise of bringing my 2014 Jeep Wrangler in for a state inspection/oil change only to roll out $864.60 poorer due to a crap, plastic, leaking factory radiator.
No off-roading
Only 54k miles!
WTH @Jeep?
Found out it’s a known issue for 2012-17!
That’s crap.
727 2018-04-27 22:19:16 He’s referring to Obama, right? 
728 2018-04-27 22:19:10 Yeah.  Please don’t cut them down to make way for oil drilling or whatever.
729 2018-04-27 22:19:10 I'll make a note of that: @Dennis_Kucinich  REFUSES 2 take Fossil Fuel money in Ohio race, BUT, his opponent is swimming in OIL & UTILITY MONEY. good 2 know
730 2018-04-27 22:19:01 And it’s worse for the planet if we are drilling for more oil overseas and then spending yet more fuel to ship it over here!
731 2018-04-27 22:19:01 No, olive oil... M
732 2018-04-27 22:19:01 logging in 2 let everyone know that witch hazel and tea tree oil are the most underrated summer products!!! both of them are very very good for skin damaged due to sun exposure! use them instead of aloe they literally rebuild ur skin. bye enjoy ur day kiss the sun

735 2018-04-27 22:18:31 Of course, but if US #Congress #reimpose #sanctions on the Central Bank and Oil sector then it has broken.
If US doesn't sanction only these two but make many more, then Iran wouldn't restart its program.
736 2018-04-27 22:18:22 We have been finding and capping oil well since 1976. You're right it's time to start using our oil!

738 2018-04-27 22:17:51 The environment DOES suffer and so do people. For example, they started fracking to get oil out in Oklahoma and now they’re having record earthquakes they never had before because of it.
739 2018-04-27 22:17:32 Also, sniff a little nasiya oil afterwards. Otherwise the nostrils dry out. Banyan Botanicals makes a great one.

754 2018-04-27 22:15:30 Cage plays a former crusader who owns a car dealership and helps Louisiana recover from the BP oil spill. In the end, he is killed in a shootout near a church. A Golden Globe nominated performance.
755 2018-04-27 22:15:13 I get it. God has a predestined, firstfruit system of church building in His timeline of salvation. But as per Jesus' parables, some fall by the wayside, lack oil in their lamps, etc. Other believers are therefore grafted into the branch to replace them.
756 2018-04-27 22:15:05 Every US corporate lobbyist who meets with Russian officials must be charged with aiding the enemy, if all it takes is having considerable "influence" on government officials. I recall Exxon had an Arctic Oil deal with Russia, didn't they? Or can CEOs do it, but pols can't?
757 2018-04-27 22:15:03 Yesterday I broke a $40 bottle of olive oil and today I cracked my phone screen... I guess you could say my track record with glass this week isn’t stellar.
758 2018-04-27 22:14:55 I think the reason I hate the idea of heaven and hell (or a war being waged for your soul) is it reduces the value of a life to a commodity like oil. It turns us into the product where success looks like how many heads are counted in a building rather than an indiscernible truth.
759 2018-04-27 22:14:25 More than the Oil in the US..
760 2018-04-27 22:14:15 @JustinTrudeau  I’m a Canadian that has had to shelve a potentially lucrative renewable energy venture to return to the struggling oil patch.

761 2018-04-27 22:14:14 besides our product, if you're looking for a simple remedy, a drop of olive oil goes a long way (sounds weird, but it works)
762 2018-04-27 22:14:08 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
763 2018-04-27 22:13:49 Sell Canadian oil ?  the only one that will prosper is BIG oil and the Politicians .
764 2018-04-27 22:13:46 Would that be the case we will have oil drilling in Florida till the dawn of XXII century. You’ll never be elected governor of Florida. Thanks  God (I should add) 
765 2018-04-27 22:13:45 Mint oil. Pour steaming water into a bowl with a few drops of mint oil. Hold your face over the bowl and cover your head with a towel.
766 2018-04-27 22:13:26 There were two pollution incidents at the Singleton Oil Field and Horndean in Hampshire has been acid-fracked
767 2018-04-27 22:13:03 Who said Ryan Shazier was walking like the Tinman before he got some oil?? 
768 2018-04-27 22:12:40 Is that happening? Is that more efficient than organizing against politicians of both parties addicted to cash from weapons manufacturers, oil and coal interests, pharma, insurance companies, and the banks/Wall Street who bankroll it all? Some accountability must take place.
769 2018-04-27 22:12:13 It's about how fast and hard the federal government acts!! Aero space/aluminum Que industries, Trudeau was right on that!! AB/SK oil or grain shipments... no so much
770 2018-04-27 22:11:48 When do you think the number of electric vehicles will begin to impact oil prices?
771 2018-04-27 22:11:40 You guys are beating a drum and just hoping to get one little tiny drop of oil out. I never thought I would say this to someone I looked up to as a kid watching Star Wars but get a life Mark and move on. It’s not healthy

773 2018-04-27 22:11:01 I notice differences when I stop taking certain vitamins, even when I forgot I stopped taking them (example: ran out of fish oil, couldn’t figure why my knees hurt, realized it had been two months, started taking them again, no knee pain). Anecdotal but pain/no pain matters.

785 2018-04-27 22:08:58 How does this affects us Economically? picture is not economic policy, Crude oil is $75usd, and no effect on any citizen, then a picture with the guy who complains that oil priceis too high is what we will celebrate?
786 2018-04-27 22:08:57 @PnPCBC clinging to old resource economics (big oil) will start to destroy us in 25 yrs once Global avg temp rises 2 degrees over the pre-industrial ave. In the last 135 yrs that global temps have been taken 8 OF THE HOTTEST TEMPS ON RECORD were in the last 10 years. Sobering.
787 2018-04-27 22:08:53 I also did a nice thing for myself and bought a really nice hairbrush and argan oil and brushed out and oiled my hair, and ohmigawd it's the little things that make all the difference, y'know?

You are an engineer. Which means you are smart! Why not take that great intelligence and create some renewal engery innovations. 

We need to move away from oil & ppl still need jobs.

The Ford Store San Leandro  CA accepted my coupon but charged me $78.88 for a 6 qt oil change. The oil alone was > "The Works" $39.95!
831 2018-04-27 22:02:38 Unfortunately we'll never be able to change the minds of people like @GregTaylor100. Even when presented with fact, they choose to believe fiction. Greg thinks that purchasing oil from dictatorships and supporting terrorism is going to save the planet. You speak of lunacy bud?
832 2018-04-27 22:02:28 Bought a Bunch of new clothes today.

Got an oil and filter change for less than 35$.

Instead of paying 200+ a rim for my damaged ones on my car, only gonna have to pay 85.

All bills paid.

Adulting successful.
833 2018-04-27 22:02:13 China, the worlds largest oil importer recently made significant investments in oil & gas.

839 2018-04-27 22:01:43 Sex trafficking is more lucrative long-term than drugs or oil. We need to reject benign intent in policies that teach girls “refusal skills” and criminalize birth control and abortions: they want sex to be fungible.
840 2018-04-27 22:01:23 Most shampoos that white ppl use have ingredients that SERIOUSLY damage PoC hair.
White hair is oily, so their shampoo is made with the intention of STRIPPING as MUCH oil as possible away (cause y'all produce more)
PoCs do NOT produce oil, so that shampoo will dry hair out BAD

845 2018-04-27 22:00:20 Reducing net greenhouse emissions is a good thing (on its own).

But for countries that currently have a comparative advantage because of their oil reserves, a decrease in dependence on oil/coal is a bad thing.
846 2018-04-27 21:59:59 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

855 2018-04-27 21:58:27 If @BarackObama allowed BP to clean up the spill while it was still localized it would have been no big deal. But he waited until the oil was on the coast. It would help you if you got your news from reliable sources and not fake news. @marcorubio @FLGovScott #ampfw

858 2018-04-27 21:58:15 Always this-

Check for leaks
Balance slide lift
Float heights
Petrol mix - too much oil = weak 
Only then play with settings

859 2018-04-27 21:58:05 White people hair is finer and naturally greasier than black people and other ethnicities with thicker, coarser hair that doest produce as much oil - that's a start in having knowledge abt hair care. Not gonna write a book for you to read. Do research. Google is free.

861 2018-04-27 21:57:46 Some would disagree but I'm glad you noticed 
862 2018-04-27 21:57:45 Ouch. If you've got some Clove Oil that can help.
863 2018-04-27 21:57:30 Dumb logic would be to equate a bunker oil spill that happens all the time to a crude oil spill that has never happened on the BC coast, dumb logic would be to force trains to haul crude oil to tide water exponentially increasing the chances of a catastrophic spill
864 2018-04-27 21:57:15 I'm white with thick long hair and can't use the hotel shampoo.
I also use an oil in my hair if I plan on getting a comb through it.
I have absolutely no expectations of any hotel catering to my hair needs.
I take my own.
I DO take theirs and donate them to a women's shelter.

866 2018-04-27 21:56:43 Será que dá tempo de ouvir a discografia inteira do Midnight Oil ainda hoje (já que não dormi e portanto hoje é dia de ficar olhando a timeline descer sem o cérebro funcionar)
867 2018-04-27 21:56:40 Our society is centered around it. We have 3 times more empty houses then the entire homeless population. We give welfare to weapon manufacturers, oil companies, airline companies and etc. Then cut education, health, and wages.  These are symptoms of a morally bankrupt society.
868 2018-04-27 21:56:36 @souljah... my people say that you can only tell the blind there's no oil in the soup but you can't tell him about the salt... good things speak for themselves,  such that even the devil wouldn't see any excuse to good.. but here its unfortunate we ve got weekly mass burials
869 2018-04-27 21:56:15 Yes, the oil industry takes a world view of the problem, knowing that demand will continue to grow.  They want to be part of the solution, believing a price on carbon will stimulate more innovation, and efficiencies.
870 2018-04-27 21:55:35 Everyone says that but tbh idk what kind I’m supposed to be buying? I went to the store and there was so many different forms of coco oil I wasn’t sure what to buy  do you have a specific brand?
871 2018-04-27 21:55:21 As we have all agreed, bitcoin (or at least other cryptos) should rise in a long time. I always tell myself that I should buy Bytecoin but I keep putting it off.
872 2018-04-27 21:55:18 @charlesmurray out of curiosity, how can you claim that the "narrow elite" r comprised of journalists while not mentioning -- banks, media company owners, oil and gas conglomerates and dark money donors (both D and R). Journos r not the problem. They don't have independent power
873 2018-04-27 21:55:15 Who know how to change oil in a car ??

877 2018-04-27 21:54:49 Ladies, if you’re trying to lock me down I would advise you to get me tickets to Taylor Swift’s show at Lucas Oil.
878 2018-04-27 21:54:34 If Kevin Durant had an endorsement deal from #ExxonMobil or #Chevron, he'd be a literal snake oil salesman.
879 2018-04-27 21:54:34 @realDonaldTrump where are you on oil Mr. President? Gasoline over $3.00 diesel over $3.00 and the crickets are chirping.  Please give us small businesses relief ASAP!
880 2018-04-27 21:54:33 The American auto industry will destroy themselves if they stop developing more fuel efficient engines and vehicles. Ford is killing off all of its sedans to just make SUVs. They will be one oil shock away from bankruptcy. Why don’t people learn from history?
881 2018-04-27 21:54:32 Let me end with these words: Some Nigerian states are poor not because they are not receiving a fair share of oil money but because they are not receiving a fair shot at true federalism. Only restructuring can correct that.
882 2018-04-27 21:54:06 Change my oil so I know it’s real
883 2018-04-27 21:54:02 I had the most INCREDIBLE brocolli the other day. Apparently smothered with za'atar and olive oil, seared then gently steamed. I haven't tried recreating it yet (but can't wait to)
884 2018-04-27 21:53:55 Final: Titusville 14, Oil City 1, 6 innings. Kierstan Wheeling caps off the Rockets win with a game-ending Grand Slam! @TitusvilleSD
885 2018-04-27 21:53:53 Don’t be sanctimonious, the provincial government gave oil sands developers sweetheart tax deals ( not subsidy) to spur development until profitability was reached. Laffer Curve theory is not part of this discussion.
886 2018-04-27 21:53:43 I have eye drops in, alevert medicine in my system, tissues & essential oil on deck, shades on...And I STILL feel like death. Pollen, why do you this!? 
887 2018-04-27 21:53:17 Euro less dependent on RU oil ?  Because if Trump , how.?   No Trump is an abscess. Dragging US down on the world stage
888 2018-04-27 21:53:05 Palpak sa Kuwait. Palpak sa WPS. Hindi kinokontra ang ang joint oil exploration. Hindi tayo tinuturing ng Intsek na may pag aari ng WPS.
Di dapat makikipag joint exploration. Kasi kung mag umpisa nang pumatak ang langis,magkano lang ang parte ng itinuturing na hindi may pag aari
889 2018-04-27 21:52:53 It would probably be called the Greatest WarGames. Anyways, I swear McMahon is getting paid in oil money.
890 2018-04-27 21:52:34 Why don't we start burning 100 dollar bills instead of oil to keep warm. 
What?
Oh, yeah, the Liberals are already doing that.
891 2018-04-27 21:52:18 Not only that but MD, VA stand to lose their famous Blue Crabs, oysters..etc..should not allow oil drilling on East coast at all.  These people have no idea or just do not care if their is a spill.  Taken over 40yrs to get the Chesapeake to its good condition now.
892 2018-04-27 21:52:12 Exactly so. 
Enemy occupier Israel is working hard to provoke the Palestinian resistance. That way they can finally get rid of the original people. Then they get the oil offshore Gaza and much space for parking lots and other BS.
They will not succeed!
893 2018-04-27 21:52:08 US shale > Oil sands.
894 2018-04-27 21:51:58 This one gal went to Amsterdam & smoked an entire cigarette sized joint in one sitting and thought weed was dangerous, not knowing one’s supposed to take one puff off of it to start since strength varies as well as personal chemistry ◎◡◎;

896 2018-04-27 21:51:44 It’s so bad the Saudis aren’t giving us any more oil
897 2018-04-27 21:51:41 Those products dry the fuck out of curly hair... period. They are essentially oil strippers. Those are made to help cater to the "standard" straight white people hair beauty model. 

:/
898 2018-04-27 21:51:36 This article reminds me of when bitcoin hit 20k and the news of it going to 50k were everywhere before it headed downwards, seems like they are tying to lure money into oil any way they can
899 2018-04-27 21:51:36 Kenney's guys are the real men. The construction workers, pipefitters, righands, like Barnard, & the managerial/exec petro-class.  I have work life experience pre and post my enviro work among blue-collar oil/construction crowd. this works: urban lazy socialists=enviro's=commies.
900 2018-04-27 21:51:25 Yup. 

Oil and gas industry in West Virginia became huge over the last decade or so. Curiously, a lot of business overlap between West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Texas. We've gotten to know winners like Don Blankenship and Pruitt because of it.

903 2018-04-27 21:51:01 2018 KSA runs 150 rigs to produce at 9.9MMbd, draws 100+kbd from inventories. 2012 9.73 MMbd with 113 rigs and storing oil at 100kbd. KSA needs 30 more rigs to maintain production compared to 2012. I haven't seen any evidence of 600-1000 wells drilled and kept as spare.
904 2018-04-27 21:51:00 U.S. seeks revision of rule on offshore oil wells made after BP disaster
905 2018-04-27 21:50:51 I'd usually correct a spelling mistake, but in this context it would be like turning up to an oil spill with a packet of wet wipes.
906 2018-04-27 21:50:48 excuse me mothers of the world, ya tea tree oil doesn’t fucking fix everything. stop telling me to use tea tree oil
907 2018-04-27 21:50:46 I still do not see the #abbamedix oil license that was disclosed on the HC website
908 2018-04-27 21:50:35 It’s a good thing we have oil coming in through the KM pipeline to insure our prices are kept low.

916 2018-04-27 21:49:49 My idea is to keep the oil sands but get rid of Alberta
917 2018-04-27 21:49:39 I’m so stressed that I just put a crazy amount of my lavender essential oil on... like an excessive amount of it... I probably smell ridiculous but I’m on the verge of crying
918 2018-04-27 21:49:37 Jungle is so weird for me! Sometimes it works great and sometimes it feels like putting glue in my hair.

931 2018-04-27 21:47:23 Those two were not singled out to be banned no more than the millions of others who have had issues with FB and had to get it corrected. The Democrats are not threatened by blacks leaving nor are blks influenced by D&S. No, D&S looked silly, ignorant & like snake oil salesmen.
932 2018-04-27 21:47:12 The 17% from the oil revenue that’s been constitutionalized but never honored by Baghdad? Also, as far as I’m concerned, the deal was made between the central govt and the KRG.

935 2018-04-27 21:46:50 We should be insuring Canada has all the fuel we need before importing or exporting 1 litre.
Other then that, I honestly don’t care what other countries are doing to their populace. We should be working our way off oil, you know, climate change and all.

940 2018-04-27 21:45:10 I don't think that really qualifies you to say on whether you're well-regulated or not. I've never met anyone in oil&gas who said "we could use more enforcement of regulations".

948 2018-04-27 21:43:28 After the Neti pot, try some coconut oil on a q-tip. It has a mild antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties that help prevent or clear up a sinus infection, and it helps keep things moist.
949 2018-04-27 21:43:26 If you have access to pure a essential oil’s, Eucalyptus oil works well. Put the eucalyptus oil in bowl of boiling water and lean your head over with a towel over your head. Make sure it is real-  not a fragrance oil... Hope you feel better soon.
950 2018-04-27 21:43:18 How in the world are activists clearly winning if the vast majority of Canada’s energy still comes from non-renewable resources and fossil fuels? Are we not still net exporters of oil and other fuels?

970 2018-04-27 21:41:30 Jerry Jones got a shit ton of oil stocks in a new deal and y'all say he is racist. Trump as said racist is deeply tied to oil..

990 2018-04-27 21:39:24 Stop trying to claim credit & make  comment on stuff you had no involvement in. Maybe focus on why Canadians are getting screwed by oil companies while Americans enjoy cheaper gas due govt policies despite oil being at $67 a barrel  & Canada being a major oil reserve holder.
991 2018-04-27 21:39:17 Oh, ok! The recipe I saw added some oil I think? Lemme investigate
992 2018-04-27 21:39:17 Yeah, damages the hair :(  will cause it to dry out and then fall out. It's not this simple but twitter is limited. "black people hair" needs to keep the oils in "white people hair" tries to keep the oil out. Black people 'typically' wash their hair far less than white people.
993 2018-04-27 21:38:47 Talk about getting rid of something. Drink a cup of olive oil and see if how it comes out the other side...pretty much the same
994 2018-04-27 21:38:37 Or we'll hang all oil execs
995 2018-04-27 21:38:34 COCONUT OIL HAS MADE MY SKIN FEEL LUSCIOUS LATELY.
996 2018-04-27 21:38:29 I’m not afraid to speak up about what I truly believe in & I believe we as a whole should stop putting truffle oil in fucking everything
997 2018-04-27 21:38:20 I'm saddened to hear about your diagnosis Elric. Please stay strong man. Also, you should check in to taking CBD oil. I hear that it has helped a lot of people with that and similar conditions.
998 2018-04-27 21:38:18 I only pay $5 to get my oil changed 
999 2018-04-27 21:38:15 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
1000 2018-04-27 21:38:06 I let the boy cut my hair and now I kinda look like olive oil but it’s cute he’s cute
1001 2018-04-27 21:38:06 Grated. Rinsed. Drained all moisture. Added a finely diced onion, some flour, an egg and seasoning. Shaped into chips and pan fried in oil.

1006 2018-04-27 21:37:44 Oil never runs out..
1007 2018-04-27 21:37:40 I agree w/Lance's view of massive QE, but neither I nor he sees it happening imminently. It will require a deflationary bust for that to happen. Ironically, a dollar surge could help trigger that bust (higher dollar creates crude oil bust, etc.).
1008 2018-04-27 21:37:28 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part white wine vinegar and 1 part cashew butter. Add ginger and brown sugar to taste.
1009 2018-04-27 21:37:25 argan oil is very nice. I am already at least 5% more reflective
1010 2018-04-27 21:37:11 It was an oil rig I remember it very clearly stood out like a sore thumb
1011 2018-04-27 21:36:47 There is no fucking technology solution. Everyone with a brain knows that. So why bother asking tech companies? They will sell snake oil but never deliver. 
It's political ffs.
1012 2018-04-27 21:36:46 The only non-mechanical part is a portion of its face. Only eats raw meat soaked in machine oil.
1013 2018-04-27 21:36:38 It is bought in bulk and may not even be bought at the hotel itself but at Corporate headquarters. I know. I have to bring my own because it strips the oil out of my scalp and such. Call ahead and might get you some for next stay. Use your loyalty programs to help you.
1014 2018-04-27 21:36:38 Yo my room smells like tangerines and peppermint, oil diffusers are amazing and a gift from God

1024 2018-04-27 21:35:48 I’m just slicker than niggas like olive oil
1025 2018-04-27 21:35:41 It’s medicine. Some women are prescribed it for morning sickness. Usually it’s just CBD oil bc it doesn’t have the same psychoactive ingredients as the thc is removed.

1029 2018-04-27 21:35:22 i feel like you can tell a lot about a person by they way they review a product on amazon. i’ve never heard of anyone being so outraged by a bottle of fractionated coconut oil in my life.

1032 2018-04-27 21:35:03 Where can I get these in oil, framed for the walls of a motel I’m now inspired to purchase just so that I can decorate the rooms with these great works of art?
1033 2018-04-27 21:34:53 (also: salads. Srsly. How is it that every salad dressing except fat free italian has soybean oil in it here. How?!?)
1034 2018-04-27 21:34:52 Ignore the oil paint!
1035 2018-04-27 21:34:51 Yes, they will take it over. I'd expect a message like this: "any oil shortfalls from (Iran) sanctions will be replaced by OPEC"
1036 2018-04-27 21:34:49 My dumbass threw the food on the pan not realizing the oil was sizzling and now i have burns all over my arms

1041 2018-04-27 21:34:32 try gently brushing the blades with a bit of olive oil before and after you trim. helps loosen up the hairs that get stuck inside and slow down rust buildup. for scissors, I find it matters less what kind they are and more how you cut.

The fish oil diet leads to the highest oxidative stress in cardiac mitochondria...”
1051 2018-04-27 21:33:45 Overall, I felt that #WWEGRR cheapened the Royal Rumble - one of WWE's finest brands. Three Rumble matches in 3 months is too many. 50 men is too many, and it was done for the wrong reasons too (Middle East oil money). Disappointed in the McMahon family for allowing it.
1052 2018-04-27 21:33:35 Today on #droz studies show that "#cannabis could relive certain kinds of pain"   Cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two most prominent cannabinoids found in Cannabis. They BOTH block pain & inflammation. Organic, non-GMO CBD Oil is a MUST! Buy link in bio.

More likely, you'd get on camera to show your loyalty. He's as bad as our Saudi and Israeli allies. The West is after his oil/gas.

1079 2018-04-27 21:30:27 My understanding is that no matter how many times any oil company says that it’s pipelines, fracking etc are safe, they’re lying & paying off the ppl who are affected & making them sign NDIs. My understanding is that they don’t car about endangering ppl’s drinking water.

1096 2018-04-27 21:28:18 No, by blocking energy east you are supporting non ethical oil that could potentially be linked to terrorism. No oil is "clean".

Our "dirty oil" label is a smear campaign to keep our resources land locked.

You support blood diamonds instead of Canadian diamonds also?
1097 2018-04-27 21:28:04 Final? You break me up @cathmckenna You won't stop until you kill the oil industry in Canada leaving us to import all oil.
1098 2018-04-27 21:27:49 Yes. Wish it was a bit clearer to me than it is. I see opportunities but oil politics....
1099 2018-04-27 21:27:43 Oh dude literally no doubt, a few “speculators,” the people that predict the future change in oil prices but make them change today, got thrown in jail when gas was up around $5 a gallon because t was proven that their speculations were based on absolutely no evidence
1100 2018-04-27 21:27:38 Huh, did they say that the Oil Rumble winner had a title shot? I mean, Lesnar/Lashley is a match that folks’ve wanted to see for years, and Braun lost his last two UC matches, so...

1121 2018-04-27 21:24:45 My understanding is that the tar sands make more population and aren’t  cost effective to be properly extracted to send for profit for Canada to the USA.

1134 2018-04-27 21:22:40 I think about what suits profiteering, pedophile globalists. War, obviously, because it is so profitable (oil, arms manufacturing, trafficking of sex slaves, children and body parts). But chaos and fear in western countries also creates a great smokescreen.

1138 2018-04-27 21:22:07 Agree 100% that oil, gas, and coal must quickly go to zero.

This plot is on an energy basis. On a carbon basis the recent rise of oil & gas has cut CO2 emissions more than the rise of renewables.

Of course locking oil & gas is also a huge problem for the future.
1139 2018-04-27 21:22:00 Believe it or not, the oil in this little bottle continues to give me the kick in the pants I need to make it through the day. No crash, no jitters. #itsamattjesticlife
1140 2018-04-27 21:21:58 No were just standing up against oil and gas expansion where we have the right to protest. That's lacking in Saudi Arabia and if Canada and the world went away from fossil fuels they would become irrelevant. You starting to see how it's all connected?
1141 2018-04-27 21:21:51 Maybe you could rinse with an essential oil solution kinda thing? Could help with the smell?
1142 2018-04-27 21:21:46 Saw it with my mother and step-father when it came out (I was 14). My step-father worked on oil rigs, hard macho man. He shat himself at the sunken boat/head bit.
1143 2018-04-27 21:21:44 I went and got my oil changed and they said they don’t carry my oil filter for my car but two months ago I got my oil changed the SAME place and they never mentioned anything about not carrying my oil filter

1146 2018-04-27 21:21:27 @unovana did you know the Navy is using solar on their new battleships.(the new ones)? They want to wean off oil and fossils, and do their part. More is going on in this direction than people are aware of. The healthcare costs alone saved by switching is a savings.
1147 2018-04-27 21:21:20 Becoming more so every year. Chatting with our oil supplier they say it is a constant job of research and dev to ensure they supply us with the right stuff

1161 2018-04-27 21:19:29 Such nonsense that energy east was stopped due to downstream ghg emissions. Did they compare energy east emissions to dirty oil tankers burning their barely regulated gas to sail all the way from Saudi Arabia?

"I'd say"

You're wrong. Our hair has the same basic property (lack of oil production). It only varies depending on how mixed you are.
1210 2018-04-27 21:13:19 I don't know how these girls/women go 2, 3, or sometimes 4 days without washing their hair.... Sometimes I wake up in the morning, or by the end of the day, & my hair looks like I washed it with vegetable oil!

1219 2018-04-27 21:12:16 Exactly! Greenies argument = fossil fuel bad, pipelines bad. 

Then they oppose projects like energy east that would have replaced huge volumes of ocean shipped oil with a zero emissions pipeline.

Just a bunch of American hand puppets.

1273 2018-04-27 21:04:06 Man-made climate change is a red herring. We need to use clean energy to stop the reliance on fossil fuels for many more relevant reasons than possible man-made global warming. Coal/Oil is poisonous on many levels.

Mind made up & he knew best. Isolated episode & sure he had his beliefs based on prev PT, but memorable 
1277 2018-04-27 21:03:55 @realDonaldTrump @VP @SebGorka @newtgingrich @StevenKBannon GAS prices too high ridiculous, WE didn't lower taxes to pay higher gas prices. We r trying to spend in economy not gas. Take the Oil from Iran & lower these prices.
1278 2018-04-27 21:03:54 Ok sooo make sure you thank @halsey when your hotel has shea butter hair oil and other black folk essentials
1279 2018-04-27 21:03:54 the cost of oil is barely over half that though. so oil companies are making a killing jacking up the prices over time but not the cost of their raw products.
1280 2018-04-27 21:03:52  what’s daily oil consumption currently??
1281 2018-04-27 21:03:42 Data is the new oil is the general vibe, but I think the real commodity at play is trust.
1282 2018-04-27 21:03:32 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.

1289 2018-04-27 21:02:49 U do realize waste plastic is also a form of oil pollution.
1290 2018-04-27 21:02:47 This time you are at least half-right Neil. But ask yourself, why exactly is Saudi Arabia so untouchable? Strategic yes but also the pure and simple reliance on oil. Embrace 'clean' energy and the global balance-of-power will change. China too.

1297 2018-04-27 21:02:10 Thank you!!! But it’s jamacan Black castor oil that did the trick 
1298 2018-04-27 21:01:34 I thought after college I’d see a day where my t-zone didn’t gather so much oil. I was wrong.
1299 2018-04-27 21:01:33 Devils advocate here. The price of fuel is more than just direct correlation to oil prices.

There are a plethora of other costs associated with the refinement, transportation and handling of fuel. And they all increase along with the rest of the economy.

1304 2018-04-27 21:00:34 You can’t out slick a can of oil.
1305 2018-04-27 21:00:25 except i was slightly wrong in that its colder countries which has less oil. But thats why they need different shampoo because i think if it dries out the oils in their hair (due to the way its structured) it becomes brittle and breaks

1310 2018-04-27 21:00:03 PurO3 oils are made when ozone is bubbled through raw organic oil. The ozone is captured and preserved and the oil becomes a gel or cream, making it easy to apply to the skin.

1314 2018-04-27 20:59:47 Oil got me numb to it
1315 2018-04-27 20:59:36 Merkel knows Trump is bought and paid for by the international oil industry and won't be persuaded to shut down development of renewable energy in order to raise oil revenues for Putin.
1316 2018-04-27 20:59:29 Lashley almost made that happen, there was baby oil everywhere.
1317 2018-04-27 20:59:26 I just look at the skin oil ratio tbh.

1319 2018-04-27 20:59:19 Higher prices are great for our industry but only so high.
When they reach a level that slows economic growth, that can drive us into a
downturn and slow or stop the development of new sources.
Stable sustainable prices are the best.
1320 2018-04-27 20:59:11 Lmfao I’m here man, also I need some more oil bro I’ll dm

1322 2018-04-27 20:58:56 Our present economic policy subsidizes oil and gas, the Military-Industrial Complex and all over state capitalism drains on our economy. This is a holistic shift that's not purely energy. The status quo of enriching corporations and the wealthy is what's really expensive

1326 2018-04-27 20:58:16 Ruled over.They stopped putting figures out in 1921 because Scotland was subsidising the UK. Before oil was landed we were paying more into the kitty. It’s ignorance like this that is embarrassing. We virtually single-handedly invented the modern world. Westminster is stealing!

1328 2018-04-27 20:57:58 maybelline 24 hour foundation is a decent dupe for the price but my skin is dry as fuck so in order to use it, i have to apply my oil primer/moisturizer, and then mix it with No. 7 airbrush away foundation so the formula isn’t as thick/cakey on any dry patches.

1342 2018-04-27 20:56:34 @MelissaLeeCNBC Please explain on your show why the oil price went up so much in a couple of months? Thanks.
1343 2018-04-27 20:56:34 Yeah, you got the family discount for sure on that one, for whatever reason when I had my explorer, it drank up lemon oil on the fret board, so I'm sure you'll need to do that at some point.
1344 2018-04-27 20:56:33 And a better perspective, how much oil does the port of Vancouver ship in a day currently? Or a month even
1345 2018-04-27 20:56:24 Do you re use the oil or is one and done?
1346 2018-04-27 20:56:22 I do like it! But if you're combo you might like something that controls your oil too. But that's up to you, i would try them out!!
1347 2018-04-27 20:55:28 All my niggas popping... must be oil or sumn. 
1348 2018-04-27 20:55:19 (1/2) These are real improvements Alexa needs, I really liked the Skills Arbitration part!, Finding a relevant skill is step 1 however this shouldn't put the user through a process of enabling a skill again. The end goal of the user is "removing an oil stain".
1349 2018-04-27 20:55:18 @Bubbles8301 there was a hissing sound from your car right? sounds like you may have a radiator or hose problem! btw shouldn't spray the engine compartment with a hose like that. to many electrical stuff in there to ruin! or it could get in w/ the oil! that can damage the motor!
1350 2018-04-27 20:55:06 Sounds fun!   I'm surprised that the regular drama shows arent burning the midnight oil to show this on today or tomorrow.  sigh.
1351 2018-04-27 20:55:03 Hmm..Really? When did O band 34 Muslim nations together to fight terrorism? Did he require NATO to pay their bills? Did he make it easier to develop oil wells ? What’s up with those pipelines? Did O renegotiate trade deals to benefit the US more?
1352 2018-04-27 20:55:03 Its all the baby oil..
1353 2018-04-27 20:54:38 Nelson represents the largest polluter in the world, airspace, govt cut funding for inspectors, Nelson himself uses more oil than the avg person bc of his traveling for photo ops, unless you live off grid you really can't say much

1359 2018-04-27 20:54:13 The minute I read coconut oil I click off
1360 2018-04-27 20:54:08 It's best to use canola oil when you're frying/browning at high temperatures. I suspect culinary experts would agree. But don't tell Tom ;-)
1361 2018-04-27 20:54:05 Weigh out two grams of olive oil then lower the temperature.
1362 2018-04-27 20:54:00 I made roasted chicken (whole) the other night with potatoes, carrot and onion. Trick is to insert garlic, lemon, salt, pepper and thyme then put some butter under skin and cover with olive oil.
1363 2018-04-27 20:53:12 Because Saddam wanted Kuwait's oil and seized it; the Saudis felt they were next; and being from the Nejd, the lacked the savvy and foresight in understanding how that would inure to Iran's advantage.  The Persians are smarter than they are and MbS is particularly dim witted.
1364 2018-04-27 20:53:08 John Woodcock has strong ties to the oil minister of a regime which stands accused of buying oil from ISIS. He is a lobbyist for BAE systems and has lent his support to Saudi Arabia in their bombing of Yemen back to the dark ages.

1377 2018-04-27 20:51:30 hot oil treatment you can make at home. Just get Shea butter, coconut oil (organic), and olive oil then heat it up and let it sit in your head with a shower cap on. (Don’t have to rinse it out). I use all doo grow products for like shampoos and conditioner
1378 2018-04-27 20:51:30 I mean. I get it. Not having shampoo specifically for. Hair with dandruff, white hair, black hair, oil for bald folks. Wtf are these hotels thinkin? Such a fucking ridiculous way to look at the world. Theres no hope for humanity left my dude
1379 2018-04-27 20:51:22 1) Heat the oil in the pans to oven temperature before putting the batter anywhere near it. 
2) Let the batter rest for at least 2 hours before adding at room temperature.
3)Make sure enough eggs are added to the flour to make it semi-liquid consistency before adding milk.

1380 2018-04-27 20:51:13 I left my car at Josh’s today, his grandpa checked my oil for me, while I was at school they had taken my car to get an oil change. I love this family so much
1381 2018-04-27 20:50:55 What are you doing in Houston for a few months?  Oil stuff?
1382 2018-04-27 20:50:28 You do realize the Alberta oil and gas industry is one of the heaviest regulated industries in all of Canada, likely one of the most stringent in oil and gas in the world?
1383 2018-04-27 20:50:26 exactly!  why do they keep making the same mistake over & over again....thereby causing crashes & recessions....& then allow the price of oil to rise when the economy is bad & people least can afford it..but not when supply & demand drive it up in boom times.
1384 2018-04-27 20:50:10 Una vez digan la verdad, a Cristóbal López no ordenaron detenerlo de nuevo por Oil Combustibles, lo hacen porque es el dueño de @C5N y porque Macri lo ordenó, en su desesperación de acallar al canal de noticias.

1389 2018-04-27 20:49:36 I'll ask you one simple question.

Norway has been putting its oil revenues into a national Sovereign Wealth Fund since the early 1980s. They have no national debt, and the SWF is worth 330 years' worth of current NWG Govt expenditure.

So, where's the UK's N Sea oil SWF? 
1390 2018-04-27 20:49:35 I'd say if you look at our inability to expand pipeline capacity and get more Canadian oil to the market, the environmental activists have surely had the upper hand.

1398 2018-04-27 20:48:49 A bit wordy and the catalyst point is not so accurate "The president has set a May 12 deadline".
POTUS Trump has set nothing on a years old deal. The deal also has a 60+day reconciliation window from 05/12. There is more but I guess its easier to mention every angle for $100 oil.

1407 2018-04-27 20:47:34 Got off work and decided to go thrifting, I walked up to the register to check out and this lady said OMG you smell so good, what is that you got on?  I think this oil is going to be my signature smell! Everyone likes it!!
1408 2018-04-27 20:47:17 Actually, there is a ton of science about running marathons and running in general. I can see and touch cosmetics, which are made using science (materials science, chemistry, etc.). The other things are all basically snake oil.

1416 2018-04-27 20:45:51 guys don’t use wipes to remove your makeup. rubbing your skin is really bad and can cause wrinkles. instead massage your face with an oil such as almond oil for a few mins and then wash it off with your preferred cleanser.

1426 2018-04-27 20:44:31 Okay so I'm pretty sure you don't use hair moisturizer or hair oil. Instead your shampoo is meant to make your hair *less* oily, not more oily. Do you think it's a coincidence that shampoo not labeled ethnic as well as shampoo at hotels strips oils?

1541 2018-04-27 20:26:52 Unfortunately, there’d be plenty companies that would employ them... I’m thinking Murdoch, oil companies, LNP, etc...
1542 2018-04-27 20:26:48 Umm... It was red with Aragon oil. I can't remember the brand.
1543 2018-04-27 20:26:42 That's what I use in my 2017 Polaris Turbo 1000 XP4 RZR & am extremely satisfied with the results. The additive pack in this oil works realy well with the extreme conditions I have put my rig through & the oil sample results prove it. No gimmicks, the oil advertises itself.
1544 2018-04-27 20:26:29 Hate getting my oil changed at Walmart
1545 2018-04-27 20:26:26 can't ruin host's towels but I think I accidentally just got face cream and oil in my eye?

1548 2018-04-27 20:26:05 Cause Trump has business there and their oil is too important, not to mention we need Saudi Arabia on good terms with us
1549 2018-04-27 20:25:47 my phones at 30% and they haven’t even began my oil change yet
1550 2018-04-27 20:25:43 Thnx for sharing! Love using avocado oil!
1551 2018-04-27 20:25:43 Yeah!!  The TMX pipeline will bring our cheap crude to port to sell it overseas for processing, so we can  IMPORT OUR OWN OIL AT HIGHER PRICES FROM FOREIGN  COUNTRIES!!! ..Why put Canadians to work when we can subsidize KM for 2 Billion with our taxes AND keep importing $$$ fuel?
1552 2018-04-27 20:25:39 When you go get your oil change and the find about five things wrong with your car.  i just came to get my oil change and that’s it 
1553 2018-04-27 20:25:29 thank you! I was considering going back & pointing out many of the things on his list can be made from cannabis(and unlike oil products, cannabis products ARE BIO DEGRADABLE). but, still, thanks 4 the competent assist

1573 2018-04-27 20:23:37 Despite the lack of coverage on DAPL, this issue persists to this day as an oil spill scare occurred only weeks ago. Even though is was a false alarm, this is still a constant worry for inhabitants living on the land. #NoDAPL #39CSustain

1578 2018-04-27 20:23:16 I'm using a bit of shea butter mixed with coconut, almod and rose (just for the smell) oil. I mainly use it bc I have terribly dry skin but I did noticed that my 1yo red (they were itchy af) stretch marks started to disappear with it.  Recommend 10/10!
1579 2018-04-27 20:22:58 no idea but im sure it wasn’t their fault :/ like we had a car that caught on fire a couple years back and it was bc we had an oil leak but my mom took it to get it checked often and they never said anything so im thinking it could be the same thing that happened
1580 2018-04-27 20:22:50 In his evidence to the Lords Committee on the Economic Implications of Scottish Independence in 2012, Professor McCrone stated that Scotland's GDP would increase by around 20% if North Sea oil were counted as part of it.

1582 2018-04-27 20:22:38 Other oil rich countries have that same problem...wonder why...
1583 2018-04-27 20:22:37 Cheaper prices at the pumps aren't coming folks. This just means richer oil-and-gas execs until climate refugees bring the whole thing down (hint: you are the climate refugees).
1584 2018-04-27 20:22:32 Sending my man to get my oil changed next time, because this verbal abuse 
1585 2018-04-27 20:22:28 Yeah interesting situation - they are the first people to be charged under the ‘Anadarko Amendment’ , to the Crown Minerals Act, they were charged by @MBIEgovtnz (not police) and it was a change in law made by the National Govt to protect the oil industry from peaceful protest...

1590 2018-04-27 20:22:07 Neville Chamberlain got more things right than Ben Rhodes.
1591 2018-04-27 20:21:50 That is a very sketchy article w/ essentially just hand waving.  It still doesn't change the fact that we will need oil for decades to come, that BC is too spread out for electric vehicles, & that until Canada can find an alternate income source we need to sell it or go broke
1592 2018-04-27 20:21:34 Leaving work to get an oil changed .... peak adult
1593 2018-04-27 20:21:32 Slyly like the burn of the little bit of oil that sizzles and pops over you when frying
1594 2018-04-27 20:21:17 Twitter is starting to sound like the 1950s. Margarine is good. Fat is bad. Supplements like fish oil, vitamin D3, and green vegetables are bad.

1595 2018-04-27 20:20:51 I only use coconut oil
1596 2018-04-27 20:20:48 I swear by Olbas oil.
1597 2018-04-27 20:20:43 Energy business - Canada down, USA booming! Canada pipelines blocked, USA pipeline bottlenecks addressed. Canada,(LNG) ports not built, USA LNG ports being built. Canada oil & gas investment down 40%, USA oil& gas investment up 40%. Figure it out for yourselves!
1598 2018-04-27 20:20:17 Bones do not become oil. Fossil fuels were made up in order to create the idea of scaricity and limited supply
1599 2018-04-27 20:19:58 Yeah black/white here. But shampoo meant for black people is way better for my hair. Shampoo meant for white people dries my hair out and I have to spray olive oil on the ends so they don't split.

1603 2018-04-27 20:19:44 idek i was getting a oil change actually and the window came with it so i don’t what they did
1604 2018-04-27 20:19:43 Justice from whom (oil users or drillers) and for what (a focus on murky increment of loss related to CO2 lets growth-focused politicians and developers building in flood and fire danger zones off the hook)?
1605 2018-04-27 20:19:23 I’m so disappointed in my allergy to tea tree oil. It smells so good and I just want to put it on everything 
1606 2018-04-27 20:19:13 No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil.
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero.

1610 2018-04-27 20:17:58 I have all Jamies books as I like his cooking what I don't like is the hypocrisy of him chucking tons of salt and olive oil in excess and then starting a national campaign about the same things in other companies food. Also not all his books do that.

1619 2018-04-27 20:16:19 They saw it. They also saw it as a way to thumb their nose at the oil industry in a subtle way.  What they didn’t count on was the piling on from their own staff due to the fact that Suzuki is a word class jerk.
1620 2018-04-27 20:16:15 I prefer oil but balm works just as well.  It's great if you don't like to rip your face off whenever you comb your beard.
1621 2018-04-27 20:16:15 Have never understood the point of honorary degrees, they’re nothing more than inventions of lobbying groups. Neither pro-anything nor anti-anything should be associated with actual degree holders of the institution. That said, big oil is behinds furor through its lobbying.

1638 2018-04-27 20:14:40 But I bet you didn't need to buy first. My hair is enjoying some coconut oil treatment…
1639 2018-04-27 20:14:34 If i ever have kids, sons or daughters, they will not only have cool cars but they will also at least know how to change their oil and change to a spare tire
1640 2018-04-27 20:14:26 Black hair does not produce the same amount of oil that white hair does. Shampoo’s job is to strip oil. The wrong kind of shampoo for black women can dry their hair/scalp horribly.
1641 2018-04-27 20:14:07 [Decamp-33-66] Waiting at the gate since 3:45 for the 4:00 66. Still waiting. It must be raining motor oil again.
1642 2018-04-27 20:13:43 -of a concert and I couldn’t hear ANYTHING. It helps in the long run but the olive oil will make your ears even more blocked for at least a day before they start clearing. I know how annoying it is, I hope it goes away!

1645 2018-04-27 20:13:07 do you have a towel you can ruin? i cleanse with oil pretty often and just rub the towel, then use a regular cleanser or soap or whatever next. as long as you wash your face after, no worries

1647 2018-04-27 20:12:40 I constantly have this problem. You can unblock them with olive oil (doctor said that kitchen olive oil works or you can buy drops) but I would only recommend doing this if you don’t particularly need your hearing ie you’re gonna be at home. I did it earlier this year on the day-
1648 2018-04-27 20:12:38 shows the difference. Unkinky, straight hair that is fine usually has quite a lot of oil in it, needing less oil and moisture in shampoo/conditioner, and more clarifying (stripping of those oils). Hair that’s wavier and coarser (like black hair) needs more moisture.

1658 2018-04-27 20:11:26 Why do I get the sinking feeling that there’s some Putin in this mix behind the scenes? Russian Oil tanker helping out NK sanctions & the bravado to which Trump handled the Rocket Man provocation/escalation.  Production value high.  Yes, cynical, but we are dealing w/ reality TV.

1678 2018-04-27 20:09:25 Perfectly rational given the fact that it is only Canadian fossil fuels that are deemed by the federal government to have an upstream GHG impact. So we can save the planet by importing ALL our oil and gas products from foreign counties - woo hoo!

1680 2018-04-27 20:09:11 A good trick we did when that happened to us is taking a paper plate, spraying it with oil, then as you see any flies you smack them with the oiled plate and there they stay!
1681 2018-04-27 20:09:01 so i bought a Groupon to get my oil changed and they didn’t accept it but still got the same amount off

It is like precious oil upon the head *

It is like the dew of Hermon which falls *

1694 2018-04-27 20:07:11 150 for the oil change 600 for the windshield  I shoulda bought a Prius
1695 2018-04-27 20:06:55 That’s so true. I love a good oil mix. If you’re looking into Ayurveda I’d suggest soaking fenugreek seeds in a few oils of your choice. I’ve also heard great things about amla oil.

1699 2018-04-27 20:06:22 I brought my car to get an oil change and they telling me I need completely new brakes and shit 
1700 2018-04-27 20:06:13 But we need oil. Would you rather import it or put Americans to work to produce it? BTW I'm all for renewable energy but we're not there yet.
1701 2018-04-27 20:06:12 Irag was not an article 5 issue, going to war over oil is not what Nato does,  In Afghanistan, all 28 countries were in Afghanistan, because of article 5

1703 2018-04-27 20:06:06 I support higher paying (resource sector) jobs for Canada. The US & China can have the lower-pay, capital & labour intensive jobs. 
Saudi Arabia's national income (GDP & overall Export) would drop like a rock if they decide not to export oil, but just plastics & fertilizers.

1707 2018-04-27 20:05:33 I didn’t even need my oil changed 
1708 2018-04-27 20:05:32 i’m literally staying by the kitchen door until this oil decide to calm tf down
1709 2018-04-27 20:05:26 And yet nobody says anything about Rex Tillerson. Is that all the sudden that if you insult the president calling him a “Moron” that you get off the hook? I’m surprised that his home hasn’t been raided to see what ties his oil company has so we know if he wanted to lift sanctions
1710 2018-04-27 20:05:19 Por qué no atraen a la quiebra de OIL el negocio del juego de López, que "vendió" con una truchada?

1713 2018-04-27 20:05:13 it's gas, and part of my wolf range. you can get an electric table top one at a restaurant supply store. 

cleaning it is pretty simple...I use a bench scraper to clean the solids off, then use a wet dish rag to get the grease etc off...then wipe with a paper towel a little oil.

World demand is growing, we are the  most environmentally responsible producer.
We would be doing more for the environment to continue to market oil
in a responsible manner.

1719 2018-04-27 20:04:01 Like there's some CT pizza where they dump spicy oil on it. It's fantastic
1720 2018-04-27 20:03:58 They might feel that way because they had 2 sell their collective tax cut loving souls 2 get the control over women's bodies and science denying oil profits that they so desired. It can't feel great knowing that U got what U wanted but... @realDonaldTrump is what he is.
1721 2018-04-27 20:03:55 I saw someone selling bleached palm oil for ayamase and I laughed. Was wondering if there was a market for it.

1725 2018-04-27 20:03:21 The administration just unveiled their plan to roll back several key offshore drilling safety regulations put in place after the BP oil spill. They’re turning a blind eye to history and putting FL at risk just to help their friends in the oil industry. We can’t let that happen.
1726 2018-04-27 20:03:16 past that, certain elements of the venezuelan state are sympathetic to oil barons like Rex Tillerson, and in that relationship these crooked politicians capitulate to whatever will line their pockets best, quality of life of venezuelan people be damned.

1733 2018-04-27 20:02:01 They could bomb out entire country on the back of any reason, flimsy or serious, and the UN wouldn't lift a finger. We all know this because we need their oil and they want the Dollars.
1734 2018-04-27 20:02:00 How bout we take down big oil n pharma while we're at it so we can finally grow hemp like a civilized country that's more about helping the human race than the humans than run everything get all the money...one can wish I guess

1772 2018-04-27 19:57:32 I do think that layering it with the oil will help. The problem with a lot of the dual use products is that it claims the SPF benefits, but it really doesn't have enough SPF in it to actually give you them.
1773 2018-04-27 19:57:17 It’s almost as if when crazy people want to kill people, they will find a way.

1796 2018-04-27 19:55:01 Revenues from oil are getting smaller in real terms while our population balloons.

MAYBE SOME FORM OF COMPANY STRONGLY REGULATED WITH SET WAGE CEILINGS
1818 2018-04-27 19:52:39 @LeonardKemplin thanks for the great oil change.
1819 2018-04-27 19:52:34 see i told my mom i should’ve went to the doctors yesterday but nope “tea tree oil will heal it!!!!!!”
1820 2018-04-27 19:52:02 Get extra pair panty I can oil the guns  rub down good
1821 2018-04-27 19:51:53 I hope to God Terry Pegula didn't pull the strings in the background and make the final call on Allen.. It would be like Bean and McDermott giving advice on where to dig the next oil well...
1822 2018-04-27 19:51:47 So I would recommend using an oil and then a moisturizer with SPF if you're having itchiness right now. Try The Ordinary's Rose Hip or Squalene Oil - see if Teegan wants to go in on an order with you to get free shipping. I recommended the same to her.
1823 2018-04-27 19:51:43 oil and stock
1824 2018-04-27 19:51:42 I've been practicing some spanish lately, I learned these words:

Industria - industry
Mago - magician

Vámonos - lets go
Elaborado - elaborate
Galaxia - Galaxy
Aceite - oil
Naranja - orange 

Such a great language, really excited to learn more so I can speak fluently soon :)
1825 2018-04-27 19:51:31 The oil rumble is an amazing name for this.
1826 2018-04-27 19:51:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1827 2018-04-27 19:51:22 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1828 2018-04-27 19:51:19 really? russian babushka moonlighting as oil trader?:) looks more like troll doing the bidding for putin  or selling her or daughter's  pussy for peepee tapes
1829 2018-04-27 19:51:16 Canola oil stinks. Butter, sunflower, olive, and toasted sesame (depending on what you’re cooking). All else is a fail.
1830 2018-04-27 19:51:15 1/2 Kinder Morgan doesn't profit from oil prices, they are insulated from them. And Canada already net exports refined products. We can't produce them at a low enough price to capture more market. There are companies who get to a refinery for less capital than the government can
1831 2018-04-27 19:51:08 The vegetable oil on some ladies lips is enough to fry a bunch of plantain.
1832 2018-04-27 19:50:50 Let me oil your walls while we listen to Pony by Ginuwine
1833 2018-04-27 19:50:45 Not alone. They were complicit but big oil bankrolled the operation. And some people believe America is a democracy! It began with the genocide of the Native Americans and may end with the genocide of mankind
1834 2018-04-27 19:50:36 Thanks for the shout out @kyoilgas! We are proud to support Kentucky's Oil & Gas Industry! #ergon
1835 2018-04-27 19:50:24 Started a new position in $MDR at 6.80, will add more on strength. This will continue to benefit from higher oil.
1836 2018-04-27 19:50:16 Tony Neese been rubbing baby oil on his lil muscles since 10am in preparation for the #WWEGRR
1837 2018-04-27 19:50:05 Do you know think it’s time to legalise Cannabis in Scotland..the amount of money the economy would get, and the health benefits of oil! #Power ofScotland #TimeToChsnge
1838 2018-04-27 19:50:03 Fantastic Mike! I’m well aware of the upgrades to the YVR fuel delivery plan, but that has absolutely nothing to do with Aframax Oil Tankers sailing out of the Westridge Terminal more than once a day will it? That’s the true story here, not YVR and not Tofino Beaches!
1839 2018-04-27 19:50:02 they used an entire got damn spot in the anti-LGBT oil rumble to put in a big fat dude for me to love, wwe is woke
1840 2018-04-27 19:49:59 Did we run out of oil? Diesel fuel works in a pinch. #NewEnglandLiving
1841 2018-04-27 19:49:55 Why not call it what it is: Economic war is being fought against Alberta's oil patch, by @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan @MikeHudema @Tzeporah and similar ilk.
1842 2018-04-27 19:49:51 Need to start the electrical train across country look at polution we are picking up the front putting in the ozone gas  and oil going into ozone killing future generations oil is there for a reason why is water in the car why is there gas pretty elementary is the sun yellow no
1843 2018-04-27 19:49:39 This wider view of immigration issues minus the emotional aspects just using rational and practical thought is not popular topic.
1844 2018-04-27 19:49:31 Is this where Russia somehow differentiates itself from USA and Golden Iraqi oil or something?
1845 2018-04-27 19:49:27 I take it that you'll be happy to pay more tax to send to Alberta to make up for lost resource royalties then... 
(even that doesn't fix everything, as my friends, colleagues, and clients work for the oil industry in a variety of jobs)
1846 2018-04-27 19:49:18 Upped my quality of life 15% this week by getting light filtering curtains and an essential oil diffuser.. why did I wait so long?!??
1847 2018-04-27 19:49:15 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
1848 2018-04-27 19:49:14 Pure snake oil with no good science behind it. Lots of anecdotes, but the good science shows crummy results.
1849 2018-04-27 19:49:06 Oil say it once and oil say it no more Androy.
1850 2018-04-27 19:49:00 Thoughts on Oil Rumble so far: push Hunicara, maybe let Viktor have some screen time solo, fire Ziggler.
1851 2018-04-27 19:48:49 bahahahahahah oh yeah theyre getting some sweet stuff but the oil daddies get to watch
1852 2018-04-27 19:48:39 I need to get some more rose hip oil........ I basically have baths in that stuff at this point..........
1853 2018-04-27 19:48:35 Someone hit me up on Instagram asking me to model.....biiiiitch  I’m hella short and my thighs are not the business. Hit me up once my coconut oil comes in and my life changes 
1854 2018-04-27 19:48:34 Unpopular Opinion: Drug, Oil, and Insurance companies aren't the evil ones...tech is.
1855 2018-04-27 19:48:33 maybe i can stand the oil. i don't know. do you just put it on your face/body?
1856 2018-04-27 19:48:28 Wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man's heart. Psalm 104:15 (ESV)
1857 2018-04-27 19:48:16 Oil changes are easy
1858 2018-04-27 19:48:04 CHRISTINA THINKS ITS SMARTER TO GET A WHOLE NEW CAR BECAUSE SHE NEEDS AN OIL CHANGE AND NEW TIRES 
1859 2018-04-27 19:47:52 Hot oil?  Colony?
1860 2018-04-27 19:47:48 Was just having a conversation w/ a colleague about the intersection of climate change & other government policies. If we eliminate the need for oil, trillions would be saved by removing military from the Middle East, allowing that money to fund health care, infrastructure, etc.
1861 2018-04-27 19:47:47 Passenger: Why your music so loud? 
Me *internally*: It drowns out the low fuel alert, low oil ding, the breaks screeching, and my internal screaming.
Me: I like to bump, foh.
1862 2018-04-27 19:47:46 My oil change just cost me $100  fuck !
1863 2018-04-27 19:47:36 If you don't know how to do an oil change I can't be friends with you
1864 2018-04-27 19:47:28 So I do NOT like coconut, but coconut milk (and coconut oil) I find rather palatable on cereal, in food, etc.
1865 2018-04-27 19:47:23 has 4 dependants and works at a gas station. With the changing econ, talk of basic income, and displacement of labor, system needs fixing
1866 2018-04-27 19:47:17 *Overheard at while getting the oil changed for Shelby*

Receptionist:”Hi, thank you for calling Lubrication Station. What can I do for you?”

Caller:*inaudible*

Receptionist:”No, sir. This is an oil change place.”

*click*

Receptionist:”Hello?”

1868 2018-04-27 19:46:43 as I was cooking the oil splashed up and hit my face and it hurts so bad. the entire area right under my lower lip is in pain fjfkaksk
1869 2018-04-27 19:46:32 I fucking did it again.

I bought tuna in oil instead of in water
1870 2018-04-27 19:46:04 No. It was red oil 
1871 2018-04-27 19:45:56 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
1872 2018-04-27 19:45:47 We should shut down the Alberta oilpatch for 1 week, shut it all down. Turn off the pumps to the pipelines, everyone from drilling rigs to completions take a week off. No oil or gas moves for a week. Let's see how the country does without us.
1873 2018-04-27 19:45:46 They have a line called "Healthy Sexy Hair" that works wonders on dry hair! And the oil treatment that they have can be used every day, even if you don't wash it daily, without it getting greasy. It's like magic!
1874 2018-04-27 19:45:35 I make no judgement on daughters case here. But it does highlight prob in immigration system of who we admit. He has been in country 21 yrs
1875 2018-04-27 19:45:20 The only thing Horgan is a defender of, in effect, is foreign oil production.
1876 2018-04-27 19:45:18 Just wonder what figure that would be for England without Oil from Scotland
1877 2018-04-27 19:45:16 WTI Crude Oil  -0.2% to 68.04 bbl $USO
Gold +0.4% at 1323.30 oz  $GLD
Copper -1.9% to 3.05 lb  $CU
1878 2018-04-27 19:45:12 Welligence — I love that a company that sounds like it should be part of the @Goop empire actually does oil & gas research.
1879 2018-04-27 19:45:11 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1880 2018-04-27 19:44:52 Naturalistas, whats the best oil you’ve used for hair growth? Right now im using Alma oil and coconut oil
1881 2018-04-27 19:44:33 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they spank
1882 2018-04-27 19:44:32 Oil and vinegar with a dash of pepper
1883 2018-04-27 19:44:22 Did u see his previous teeet to me earlier about rubbing me in Sun oil !
1884 2018-04-27 19:44:05 Question: Does #Gambia really have oil? 
1885 2018-04-27 19:44:02 Great day to break out the tanning oil
1886 2018-04-27 19:44:00 The human version of coconut oil
1887 2018-04-27 19:43:50 Says a lot about a nation and it’s vision when it’s  only hope is in an oil rich nation with zero democracy and in  rolling out the red carpet for a right wing egomaniac POTUS. How did we get here? #BrexitBritain
1888 2018-04-27 19:43:47 I had the worst luck with @stiiizy, the last three carts leaked from the top and I tasted the excellent oil, I won’t stop buying but damn it sucks, I returned one because it was a gram, I just love #stiiizy so much
1889 2018-04-27 19:43:42 #GDP US 1stQTR GDP worries: delete aircraft sales, & core capital spending almost flat (despite Trump tax cuts). Consumer spending only 1.1%, as autos and housing now affected by interest rate hikes + Oil, health & rent prices to take further bite in 2018. Net trade to worsen.

1891 2018-04-27 19:43:37 Amen. Anoint with the Oil of Joy --- honor that worshipers and evangelists experience depression though excitable ministry, however different than prophets who may spend lifetimes mourning back the dead, souls to Christ, not depressed.
1892 2018-04-27 19:43:29 Excellent question. While we're at it:
- Why does he want to continue to use a 65 yr old pipeline until it fails?
- Why does he want more oil products by train/truck due to capping dilbit and pipeline expansion?
- Why does he want to reject funds to improve marine spill response?
1893 2018-04-27 19:43:18 We should shut down the Alberta oilpatch for 1 week, shut it all down. Turn off the pumps to the pipelines, everyone from drilling rigs to completions take a week off. No oil or gas moves for a week. Let's see who the country does without us.

1896 2018-04-27 19:42:26 Hey @MisterRedMcGhee what are you doing with all that Wesson Oil?   Fish fry??
1897 2018-04-27 19:42:07 At the recent Sammamish Spring Recycling Collection Event, we collected 48,268 pounds of electronics, 18,300 pounds of shredded paper, 532 TV sets, 605 gallons of used motor oil and petroleum-based products, 31,240 household batteries, and 12,112 pounds of cardboard!
1898 2018-04-27 19:42:04 I used a pic off of google for reference & used oil on an unusable drum head
1899 2018-04-27 19:42:04 Today has been the best and most productive day I’ve had in a while. Got a haircut, got my oil changed, spent an hour in the gym, got tickets for #AvengersInfinityWar tomorrow, picked up an Xbox game, just got a cold brew on draft, and now I’m about to go drum for an hour.
1900 2018-04-27 19:41:56 We went to Belize last year and they did an amazing rice cooked with coconut oil.
1901 2018-04-27 19:41:48 He was a submariner, then oil field, now a shipridder.
1902 2018-04-27 19:41:42 I’d oil your hood anytime 
1903 2018-04-27 19:41:32 So I'm sitting here calmly waiting for my oil change and this fat bitch starts talking about I'm giving her a bad look....wow being pretty around ugly women is wild. I didn't even look at her fat ass .
1904 2018-04-27 19:41:30 rub down my body with oil and give me a nice massage
1905 2018-04-27 19:41:25 Homeopathy as complementary to medicine isn’t harmful . It’s when it replaces medicine completely or it’s promoted by snake oil salesmen touting fake & offensive “cures”.
1906 2018-04-27 19:41:23 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
1907 2018-04-27 19:41:16 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1908 2018-04-27 19:41:07 What about burning down Indonesia’s rainforest in the name of palm oil?
1909 2018-04-27 19:40:52 How did I get to be my age and never have cooked with coconut oil before. It makes everything so yummy!  #keto
1910 2018-04-27 19:40:33 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
1911 2018-04-27 19:40:33 To build wind turbines & solar panels, you need vast amounts of coal, oil, gas & rare earth metals mined using fossil fuels - so it will be pretty impossible to achieve & maintain without the petroleum industry, don't you think?
1912 2018-04-27 19:40:27 At least have truffle oil on the eggs if you're going to have three meals on one plate.
1913 2018-04-27 19:40:23 Rupert Murdoch and Jacob Rothschild have a company called genie oil that has been given all rights in Israeli occupied Golan heights in Syria. It's all about making people scared of condemning Israel's actions. Somehow when we condemn our own we're not anti Saxon.
1914 2018-04-27 19:40:22 If Kanye West was Nigerian by now he’s family members  will be at house with a pastor and army of prayer warriors . Whole house will be drenched in holy water & olive oil .

PS IF (and I stress IF) I dare to use hotel shampoo, I add my all-purpose coconut or grapeseed oil to it so it doesn’t dry me out :)

1934 2018-04-27 19:37:44 Bones don't turn into oil
1935 2018-04-27 19:37:33 The cbd oil helps i use that. It usually takes the pain away for quite a while actually. I’ll prolly make an appointment at a massage parlor too. That might help some as well

1938 2018-04-27 19:36:35 1/2 Oil and cereal for Canadians only correlate on a transportation basis, reflect in the net revenue not the unit price. We are only around 20% of the global export market so unless we completely stop delivering we are not the driver for the market.
1939 2018-04-27 19:36:31 Then you sir are a typical Brexiter. Much more concerned with emotive sound bytes than anything of any practical or financial benefit. You had a problem and because of an opportunist bellend like Farage, you bought his snake oil because it was easy and didn’t require thinking any
1940 2018-04-27 19:36:26 I just read an article about this today! Trump and his minions seem to want to deregulate everything regardless if it does good or bad. I believe that this same rule would make it so they can override the local laws to force the oil rigs on them even if it can ruin the economy.
1941 2018-04-27 19:36:21 Men should have very little soy.  Fish oil, preferably from fish they’ve caught and cooked over campfire. Or eaten raw.
1942 2018-04-27 19:36:12 Sir just olive oil nostrils me dalain 2-2 drops aur phir muu ander kar k so jaien. In Sha ALLAH aram aa jae ga aur sath me anti allergy zarur lain.
1943 2018-04-27 19:36:10 my brother............. try to understand there are two aspects in a commodity world  demand &supply .......... right now supply of oil may be huge  but there is much bigger pent up demand all over the world that will just drive oil higher
1944 2018-04-27 19:36:10 Bismid + coconut oil
1945 2018-04-27 19:36:07 Taking my car for an oil change is like taking my car to the doctor. The entire time they are like timing in and out like in an OR. ‘Oils in’ ‘closing hood’ ‘brakes checked’ ‘all clear’
1946 2018-04-27 19:36:06 A total psycho just walked into Midas and wanted an oil change. Then cussed out the attendant because he didn’t want to give out his address or phone number for a customer profile.

1956 2018-04-27 19:34:24 Are you really that DUMB? Months ago Trump was  starting World War III with North Korea. He calls it PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.  He also cut off all oil, and froze Billions of dollars from North Korea. Very few goods are coming into their country. Wake up snowflake.

1963 2018-04-27 19:33:27 1.Economically choked amd isolated the regime (wich Obama could have done)
2. Forced china to stop supplying nk with food, gas, gas oil. Thefore forcing kim to come to the table to prevent a domestic revolution against his own regime.
3.Supplying sk with patriot sam air defense
1964 2018-04-27 19:33:12 Car places really do try to get over on women. This man didn’t tell me all of the oil change options they had, he just said we’re gonna go ahead and do the preferred. I’m like no, the basic is just fine thanks

1985 2018-04-27 19:31:35 Brilliant work!  We love all you do and already support and encourage the use of only sustainable palm oil... Can our local theatre company do any more to help out at all?  create a performance, etc?  We're based at @NWMuseum, Ellesmere Port.  :-)

1987 2018-04-27 19:31:30 It's too early to be calling out the haters. The road ahead is a long one. However, I think WT may just find a way out if oil prices remain elevated.

1992 2018-04-27 19:30:48 Can we not stop this alternative medicine bullshit? Snake oil keeps getting renamed by modern charlatans that profit off the families of dying patients. There ought to be a law. Oh - there is a law against fraud already!
1993 2018-04-27 19:30:36 I smell a new CBB character!!..... Oh no, wait, that's my sweatshirt that I wore two days in a row after cooking with sesame oil...
1994 2018-04-27 19:30:25 Shaq’s just doing some dollar cost averaging and riding fluctuations in gas prices over regions and oil prices. Clearly.
1995 2018-04-27 19:30:15  you know we like water and they oil... So we don't mix
1996 2018-04-27 19:30:14 Covergirl Matte worked really good for mine. Try using translucent powder on top! It really helps with oil!

2012 2018-04-27 19:27:43 Liberal policies are driving Oil & Gas investment out of Canada and to the USA.

So, if putting Canadians out of work and then forcing us to buy imported oil & gas was all part of your master plan - Congratulations!

2018 2018-04-27 19:26:46 If you really think Kim jong Un is for real in peace talks let me tell you about this new thing called snake oil. Feigning peace has gotta be his play, North Korea hasn’t gotten this far without having some semblance have tactical wherewithal.

2026 2018-04-27 19:25:43 The oil rumble!
2027 2018-04-27 19:25:42 My beard is naturally luxuriant without oil. If I don't need oil, what am I going to be compensated with? I want equal resources allocated for me. Free booze seems acceptable.
2028 2018-04-27 19:25:39 @realDonaldTrump WHY THE RISING COST OF OIL/FUEL!? We know that the price of oil effects EVERYTHING! Tap into our reserves NOW! People are being severely effected by this. Knock it off, OPEC!
2029 2018-04-27 19:25:31 Is it ok that their economy is based on oil? Or does that make them bad?

2034 2018-04-27 19:24:58 @Shell you are doing fraud with customers . Received remaining balance in SMS are totally different with available remaining balance & also more consumption as other oil company. Worst Customer service.
2035 2018-04-27 19:24:43 You get your oil changed when the sticker from the last on says you should or when the light come on in he car?
2036 2018-04-27 19:24:35 Just ask yourself one question, why do westminster fight tooth and nail to hold onto Scotland. If we dont pay our way, if we need English pounds to sustain us .... why not say .. cheerio, and save all those English pounds .... here's a clue, oil, gas, wind, wave and hydro power.

2042 2018-04-27 19:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
2043 2018-04-27 19:23:55 And make sure you check your car after they assure you that they’ve repaired the vehicle. Apparently, ensuring that your oil is NEW and WILL NOT LEAK OUT the vehicle is not part of their job requirement  #MEINEKE
2044 2018-04-27 19:23:46 An oil spill is less slimy than these two.
2045 2018-04-27 19:23:11 I believe a naturalized citizen is treated the same as citizen by birth. Both are governed by rules that have several variables—in or out of wedlock, residence of citizen.
2046 2018-04-27 19:23:08 I can tell it's almost summer because all my coconut oil products have turned to mush.

2051 2018-04-27 19:22:38 One more shampoo. I tried a shampoo from a Paris salon. The stylist was Japanese. It had camellia oil in it and smelled divine. I took it on a short trip. By the third day, I was trying to figure out what had happened to my hair.
2052 2018-04-27 19:22:38 Why does dominos smell like congealed grease shaved off a fat man's ass fried in rapeseed oil?
2053 2018-04-27 19:22:21 ...what if "OIL" was out of the equation, out of your bank account...opinion possibly different...
2054 2018-04-27 19:21:14 Nah man, the furthest I’ve been is Spain. I’ve got it planned for my 30th and American Road trip. So save for 2 years and come to Indy, Lucas oil and hopefully the Indy 500 as well

2057 2018-04-27 19:20:47 We citizens of Nigeria need to be upright to be able to demand for right things to be done.I am a Nigerian and I don't support visionless charade.Rwanda is not selling crude oil but in d last 3 years they've become no 1 biz destination in Africa.we should be leading
2058 2018-04-27 19:20:47 Money, greed and power. Why did G Bush bomb Iraq when most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi?  Because oil, money and greed.
2059 2018-04-27 19:20:20 @SpeakerRyan what do you think of the oil storage tank damage that is causing the residents of your state (and close to mine) to evacuate. This could have been prevented under your watch but you’ve chosen to side with major oil companies that hurt the planet!

2065 2018-04-27 19:19:10 #Axthetax  There needs to be major push back against Peter Pan PM Justin (soon to be Just Out) Carbon Tax and the choking of our oil industry.

2069 2018-04-27 19:18:55 They’re with him because they also feed at the same trough of gas and oil industry campaign financing. If they deny climate change is it any wonder that they see Pruitt as the victim, not the thief?

2071 2018-04-27 19:18:47 There is no oil shortage. 

Saudi Arabia could adjust production by ~500k in short order & have done so 4 times since 2015. They are the Federal Reserve of the oil market.

SA wants Iran marginalized. Trump can do this. Trump doesn’t want high oil prices. Not hard to connect dots
2072 2018-04-27 19:18:45 Cutrin blonde fucking rules. Sooo efficient! Don't have to towel dry (as the instructions say to do) and 2 minutes is enough. Best I've tried.

2076 2018-04-27 19:18:17 Our gov needs to make medical cannibus oil legal and let doctors prescribe it and insurance cover it, like any other drug. There's no need for people to suffer constantly. It's just common sense, & it's time to end pharma's reign over what we treat pain with.

2092 2018-04-27 19:16:22 To paraphrase Midnight Oil’s Peter Garrett... how can you sleep while your hair is burning?
2093 2018-04-27 19:16:21 These car dealers try to get me to do a trade in everytime i get my oil changed
2094 2018-04-27 19:16:10 I’m not an Oil Company and I’m speaking of the illegal immigrants crossing our border daily. You keep voting for your Libs and we’ll see how much you love Canada in 5 years time.

2098 2018-04-27 19:15:28 Don't mind me, I'm just over here pouring tea tree oil onto my BLEEDING SCALP. Ahhhh, dry Colorado is not treating me well at the moment.
2099 2018-04-27 19:15:23 I can't really use that stuff either. Ginger hair is very specific in its needs. I would stay exclusively at any hotel that promised to stock their rooms with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil line.
2100 2018-04-27 19:15:20 Student called it crud oil instead of crude oil throughout her entire presentation & you know what? It should be crud oil.
2101 2018-04-27 19:15:01 Oii.. enna coconut oil?? 
2102 2018-04-27 19:14:56 There are a lot of good things you can do with ramen if you just have a hot water. I highly recommend Nissin Raoh, they're like 2$ per but they have really good oil sachets and with some chopped green onions, jerky, and an egg are a pretty complete meal.
2103 2018-04-27 19:14:53 True! Snake oil salesmen want us to think that adding their latest health product to our standard protocol will make it healthier. Nothing could be further from the truth. Eliminating (the "wrong" things) is the proper strategy. There r no magical additives.
2104 2018-04-27 19:14:53 Hi. I don't know what it is going to take to get big oil to agree time's up and announce big step-by-step rapid action to  shift to renewables. I really don't know.  It seems all so clear. Even the future of those corps is at risk, shareholders at risk. Oh, and life.

2107 2018-04-27 19:14:42 In this debate Raju Dhruv said loudly that prices of commodity like oil, vegetable, etc reduced but he must accept that princes have gone down because of the less demand a common men have not enough money to survive family life if he purchase in quantity.
2108 2018-04-27 19:14:41 @ThinkAtheist I like those @GBerlanti shows, but mixing positive gay stereotypes with insulting christian beliefs is contradictory, like rubbing oil and water. That’s the flaw of the shows.
2109 2018-04-27 19:14:38 To put in perspective, Saudi Arabia have 2 trillion of oil. North Korea could afford to buy Saudi Arabia. It hurts the brain how rich they could be
2110 2018-04-27 19:14:26 Uses for Tea Tree Oil
Fleas, ticks, mosquitos, all external pet parasites.
Lice,mosquitos, etc on people. Add to shampoos, make strong, wash skin daily. Easy Peasy. Been working for us for more than 40 yrs 3 gens.
2111 2018-04-27 19:14:24 What does a hug from each @NeoScum character smell like? I'd say a hug from Z is sharp and smells like doritos and gun oil.

2116 2018-04-27 19:13:59 Thanks for the info! I do wonder what the law is for minor dependents of naturalized citizens.
2117 2018-04-27 19:13:57 Regular oil changes. Transmission is fine at such low miles. Look how clean interior is. Worn seats, steering wheel, etc tell how well it was cared for as a whole. Brake rotors should be smooth and not like a record with ridges.
2118 2018-04-27 19:13:56 money speaks volumes, wait until the vultures and hyenas feel it, more money than oil, more money than plastics, more money than anything else if allowed, just not more money for the people that are making it now on all those other things
2119 2018-04-27 19:13:51 I'm so illlllll.

And for some reason in my nap I dreamt I was painting a new 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop blue with oil paints... on the touch screen.

I was dissatisfied with how it was going.

I don't know???

2124 2018-04-27 19:12:34 "It is..." He murmured and moved the oil lamp closer to his face, beneath it to lighten it up in a more creepy way. Then he turned around to face her with his free hand raised, palm  curled like in a bear and he murmured really huskily. "A mummy!"

2127 2018-04-27 19:12:06 Best product for repelling ALL parasites on people and pets is Tea Tree Oil. Put it in shampoo to repel lice, fleas, mosquitos, etc. Wash with it daily. Been working for us for 40 years, no fail.
2128 2018-04-27 19:11:49 Need an air filter, breaks, and oil change.
2129 2018-04-27 19:11:46 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2130 2018-04-27 19:11:39 Not necessarily. In Ireland the main risk crop these were used on is Oil Seed Rape, and quite a few farmers actually wanted to stop using them, but the seed companies (owned by the agrochemical companies) would only sell seed already treated with these chemicals.
2131 2018-04-27 19:11:35 Plain green tea is the best thing I've ever found for controlling the oil and redness in my face. I don't care how weird I look squeezing out my teabag and rubbing it on my face. I will do this till the day I die. #psa #yourewelcome #skincare
2132 2018-04-27 19:11:27 They will never be carbon neutral. The carbon produced harvesting, processing and shipping them is never recovered.
If they are made from lumber mill and logging waste it is much better.
Probably better than oil, but lets not lie about it.
2133 2018-04-27 19:11:26 You need more information regarding distributed solar & batteries cost, technology, growth cycles. Once you understand that even if nuclear/ gas/ coal / oil were free they could not compete with distributed solar & batteries due to their distribution grid transmission loss.
2134 2018-04-27 19:11:21 I need a hair cut, an oil change, gas, a car wash, and some tree...

2145 2018-04-27 19:09:52 Ooh bummer. I just tossed it w a little salt,  pepper, oil, and minced garlic pre-roast and a touch of fresh squoze lemon juice after. Delish! (Doesn’t need the lemon IMHO but my wife liked it with.)
2146 2018-04-27 19:09:51 I still haven’t taken my messy bun out from when I woke up & I’m currently sitting a car shop waiting for the oil to be changed. That’s the kind of day it is

2150 2018-04-27 19:09:13 Empty cars do nothing to help revenue even if the per unit price rises, I don't take the revenue until the unit is purchased. And the price of cars this year wasn't the issue it was getting them to arrive, because oil pays better than grain.

2157 2018-04-27 19:07:09 Wait..... Those of you all that bought #Bambeautyoil. Can you tell us what you use the oil for? A friend just told me some of you use it as anointing Oil.

2164 2018-04-27 19:06:19 i’m making pasta and went to put hot water into the pot which had oil in it and set it on fire almost burning the house down in the process which set off the fire alarms
2165 2018-04-27 19:06:11 homeopathy is the worst snake oil crap, isn’t it?!
2166 2018-04-27 19:06:00 Things you learn while painting a house: oil based primers don’t come off with water, and when you panic and try to rub the paint off harder it just gets everywhere and looks like you’re wearing lotion  but thanks to the internet I finally removed it with baby oil 
2167 2018-04-27 19:05:36 It stretches the imagination to try to label these acts as anything but malicious. They go beyond kowtowing to the oil/gas lobby and enter the realm of nihilism.

2177 2018-04-27 19:03:21 You are indeed beggars.

Blacks go to the negotiating table with two things.. 1.) Begging or 2.) Complaining. “Can I work for you?”, “Can you educate me?”, “Can you feed me?”, “Can you be fair?”.

You bring nothing, no wealth, no oil, no gold, no trade, no power and no influence.

2241 2018-04-27 18:55:25 #45 did the easy thing: loosened up a few enviro regs allowing the oil taps to be turned on. that’s easy. he's banking on bluster, threats & blame hoping it creates momentum. so far the only winners are the rich & they are NOT reinvesting what he needs to make this work. #deficit

2266 2018-04-27 18:50:54 I guess you don't look at the little signs on the pump that show the massive amount of the price is taxes. I guess you also don't use heat for your home,have anything using plastic... much of the oil isn't for fuel it's for manufacturing. But virtue signaling doesn't need facts.
2267 2018-04-27 18:50:42 Again $cad showing solid strength even as oil weakens watch both the dxy/eur$ on the daily closes dxy/bearish pinbar vs eur$ bullish pinbar+gold holding it's own. Gl g/w:)

2272 2018-04-27 18:50:07 Of course they did... Oil goes up, gas goes up... but the cost to Exxon to get the oil stays the same...
2273 2018-04-27 18:49:40 Getting my oil changed currently and the guy working on the car next to me is talking about how he is sick of buying crickets for his lizard. 
2274 2018-04-27 18:49:30 Additional this is a University that was (maybe still is) known for producing high quality heavy oil reservoir engineers. Certainly does not honour a university that was fundamental to bringing training for this profession to Alberta.
2275 2018-04-27 18:49:25 Best petroleum minister who still thinks that till today when our oil prices at all time high is not the right time to interfere in controlling the oil prices

2278 2018-04-27 18:49:09 For example, most hotel shampoos contain certain types oil. I get acne breakouts if the shampoo has oil in it. Hotels can’t cater to everyone. I don’t feel marginalized, oppressed, or aggressed because a hotel doesn’t carry oil-free shampoo.
2279 2018-04-27 18:49:09 Dismay in dad's voice as I told him of the oil vadapavs.

2281 2018-04-27 18:49:05 Thanks. I’ve been taking citrate 400mg morning with no tummy issues but still getting muscle twitches and restless legs. Was going to try another 400mg evening and perhaps try 200mg topical oil on legs before bed. Think I’ll just start adding the topical and see first.
2282 2018-04-27 18:48:47 The dollar is a factor in the price of oil to the world outside of the US. But it’s not the only factor. The low dollar last fall helped accelerate inventory draws for sure
2283 2018-04-27 18:48:41 We want good ports that has 12-hour TAT time. We want smooth, non-congestion, controlled access roads, we want good airports, trains, but we dont want to pay for them.

2293 2018-04-27 18:47:51 You're on CRACK! Banks and the Fed set those interest rates amidst global oil glut (caused by Carter too, right?). BHO inherited worst economy in history. NAFTA is massively profitable. Tech crash was caused by overvalued tech stocks, and the housing bubble was Bush (again)

2369 2018-04-27 18:39:13 @NPR - Could you do a story on the judge's reversal regarding oil and gas development in/near Chaco Canyon? I'd like to better understand how this potentially impacts the ancient sites as well as the current native residents of this region.
2370 2018-04-27 18:39:09 I got one 2nd hand. 
Bought a service kit for the Kawasaki engine, changed the hydraulic oil and put a new set of blades on and it seems to be doing the trick.

2376 2018-04-27 18:38:37 Are you arguing that because oil has been spilled in the past, there can be no objection to future spills?
2377 2018-04-27 18:38:33 I have a salt lamp.. I got some essential oil last night!

2395 2018-04-27 18:37:06 They use it in fracking too, that is why guar or motikayala price in India fluctuates in sync with global crude oil prices.

2405 2018-04-27 18:35:51 Horrifying stats. I have tried to avoid palm oil since I watched a documentary a year or so ago. I never realized how many products have palm oil.

2417 2018-04-27 18:34:26 This is true only if demand exceeds supply. Oil is bought and stored for months. Any price rise is for profit not demand

2419 2018-04-27 18:33:58 Fact; keeping oil on the rails also means not being able to transport other goods to market.  
I worked for a farmer a few weeks back that was just getting his canola shipped, it was supposed to go in January.  This pipeline fight is screwing more than just oil jobs

2466 2018-04-27 18:28:32 Read your history about the US and UK occupation of Iranian land and our theft of their oil. Not to mention us installing a corrupt govt and ruining their sovereignty. If that happened to us, we’d be pissed too
2467 2018-04-27 18:28:20 That can only last so long!  I'd suggest hand washing with olive oil then soap
2468 2018-04-27 18:28:20 just drank some olive oil

2474 2018-04-27 18:27:48 Nice! Your fluid posts have reminded me of cinematic Vfx for water and splashing in film. I'm thinking about how this could "flood a room " with liquid, then be substituted with a softbody rectangle when the room is "ankle deep" in water, oil, paint, etc

2479 2018-04-27 18:27:00 We can help you in removing your old oil tank. Call us today.
2480 2018-04-27 18:26:44 I skimmed but I should wait until I’m off the clock to read. I’m still worried about the overall impact of the spill. One of those tankers going down isn’t going to be the same as the oops, oil-off-the-deck spills we have now…
2481 2018-04-27 18:26:25 I'm sure you will be very successful with your short position on oil... Demand keeps rising at a rate of +1mn barrels per day annually. That does not mean I pro-fossil. It's just a fact.
2482 2018-04-27 18:26:09 You don't real understand but in a way I feel sorry for you. Why then do you have military bases in most oil/resource rich countries and  wage war/covert war in those oil/resource rich countries where you have no  military bases? Defending your freedoms?
2483 2018-04-27 18:26:00 Yes, you just crap fat/oil 
2484 2018-04-27 18:25:58 im excited for yall because I dont actually hate Liverpool like United/City/Chelsea so im hoping you get the job done since Arsenal will probably not win it. Rather yall then oil money or SAF history FC

2486 2018-04-27 18:25:43 @smhosglobal talking about creativity, a high sense of creativity is exhibited in the youths of Niger delta who go a long way to refine oil without the use of standard equipment s, yet they are being arrested instead of being trained for better utilization, how do we stop this?
2487 2018-04-27 18:25:35  but does the soy sauce have palm oil inside?

2495 2018-04-27 18:24:48 What is really shameful is what you are doing to the Department of Interior--proposed cutting budgets for all major conservation aspects. You never even mention conservation unless coupled with getting revenues from oil-gas-coal. You are shameless so don't talk about "shameful."
2496 2018-04-27 18:24:38 Yup. A shitty year to be sure but his history suggests It's a one-off and not the norm.
2497 2018-04-27 18:24:22 Things i hate:
1- waiting for an oil change
2- being forced to watch extremely low-budget talk shows on competing broadcast channels

So, clearly, i am currently waiting to get my oil changed and guess what's on in the waiting room?
2498 2018-04-27 18:24:16 I would like to congratulate the two lovely 8 year old boys in my sons class at school who read the ingredients of their ice cream one lunchtime and have now written to our school meal provider to ask them to stop serving ice-cream with #palm oil in. #readlabels

2501 2018-04-27 18:23:58 That's nice but I followed the US carpetbombing Raqqa when Syrian forces were nowhere near it. I also followed the US destruction of  Balkan, Iraq and Libyan infrastructure when neither Russia nor Assad was involved. 
I noted the Coalition's inability to stop ISIS oil flow...

2512 2018-04-27 18:22:00 Yep.I mentored a graduate mechanical engineer who wanted to get into Safety.
I advised him,although on a MPDS of IMechE to get Chartered,he would best join IChemE or Inst of Energy.
He would probably have to leave present company.  He did very well in Oil Ind. Company sold itself

Okay. Unpacked:
Anyone with more recent African roots may have curlier, more coarse hair which a) may not produce as much oil and b) may not spread oil as quickly. This means that the hair either does not need shampoo as often or requires sulfate-free.

2541 2018-04-27 18:18:16 I don't think it is a trend correlation, rather an "of the moment" impact. Similar to a risk premium.  Can raise/lower the $ of crude, without ever any real impact on s/d dynamics. A low DXY does not create expensive oil, but it makes expensive oil more expensive.

2572 2018-04-27 18:15:00 The technology to reduce or eliminate the use of petroleum for transportation already exists and the higher prices for oil will push that technology into common use
2573 2018-04-27 18:14:50 Dumb strategy from oil price makers. If it goes down it is sure bad, if it goes up it's even worse as it invites new producers to invest, gives alternatives more punch, and constrains growth and dependance. They have nowhere to run. It will be funny when the big short comes

2638 2018-04-27 18:05:47 I accidentally put too much oil in the food and now I know the marines will be here any minute.

2641 2018-04-27 18:05:25 is essential oil a personality
2642 2018-04-27 18:05:18 Getting off work early, bout to wash my hair and hit that bitch with all the coconut oil. #DreadProblems
2643 2018-04-27 18:05:13 how are you mad because i don’t want to put oil in my car 
2644 2018-04-27 18:04:56 They are not just going by tho but coming in & unloading non motorized barges filled with Oil, etc in the Port of Vancouver. I worked for CN Rail there for 5 years. They ship tons of coal out.  YVR is building a pipeline from the US to the airport to ship jet fuel. Its hypocrisy
2645 2018-04-27 18:04:41 I'm just gonna leave this here: putting baby oil in your hair (ends only) wasn't a very good idea. Mistakes were made. #IRegretEverything

2647 2018-04-27 18:04:33 LOL i don’t even own a brush, i hate them. And i am all about dirty hair, but not stringy greasy strands hanging in face and looks like an oil spill  can’t do it. Especially in a professional setting 
2648 2018-04-27 18:04:18 At the Auto Shop getting my oil changed debating if I should call off or not.
2649 2018-04-27 18:04:16 You should buy a big cowboy hat and travel around Ireland pretending to be a Texas oil magnate
2650 2018-04-27 18:04:09 You turn chemist . Which other cold press oil did you use? Olive? Coconut?
2651 2018-04-27 18:04:08 North Shore Atlantic oil that’s how.
2652 2018-04-27 18:04:06 A masters level research social work student did a presentation and said you can buy cbd oil at every gas station in Texas and also that weed is worse than heroin for fetuses and when I asked for his references he said he “heard someone say it” and 
2653 2018-04-27 18:04:05 Plus C60, CBD oil, bring the herbs my friend!
2654 2018-04-27 18:03:57 every time i go to get an oil change it’s always some other shit
2655 2018-04-27 18:03:39 Dont remind us of the disgraceful act.  Not for the people or by the people.   This will be your legacy.  Opening up public lands to the oil and mining corporations.   Teddy Roosevelt is very sad and ashamed of his party.
2656 2018-04-27 18:03:38 Were it actually "Canada's oil" Canada would enact regs. that ensured "our oil" was used to supply Canadians gas at a reasonable price first before selling bitumen to US at a 30% discount - but it's only "Canada's oil when we want to get it to market "for the good of the country"
2657 2018-04-27 18:03:32 just woke up at 2am bc i forgot to put castor oil on my lashes. if these lashes dont reach the ceiling when i wake up........

DID SOMEBODY SAY OIL? #WWEGRR
2659 2018-04-27 18:03:25 Car insurance,               house insurance, power bill, flea/tick meds for 3 canines plus an oil change & air filter for the truck and “POOF” my  is gone
2660 2018-04-27 18:03:24 Moove Oil is a 2017 Afriqia subsidiary that is supposed to be "low cost" and destined for the rural world. -- but that's low
2661 2018-04-27 18:02:57 starting one of my final projects ......a cursed art nouveau oil painting..... with real oil paints that ive never used so im scared

R/Aslam...
2663 2018-04-27 18:02:27 Such a flawed premise that if you are concerned about this pipeline then you must love coal and love oil by rail.  Maybe you can connect also that BCers love Hitler too.
2664 2018-04-27 18:02:24 "Got me a Chrysler. Big as a whale. Belches smoke and oil. Grease where it shouldn't be in the floormat. The whores cry out to their johns in false pleasure. Mother. I remember. Spit out another tooth and throw another fist."
2665 2018-04-27 18:02:01 And this oil will travel along that coast on the way to Asia whether it leaves through Burnaby, where at least Canada can control the shipping standards of the vessels. Or through another port. That ocean is connected to the rest. I trust Canadian standards more than most.
2666 2018-04-27 18:02:00 @Citizen_Cate Exactly my point. With so much sun it allows them to export heavily subsidized domestic oil to be burnt in someone else’s backyard. Therefore meeting their phony Paris Accord agreement! Total scam! It’s no wonder Trump got us out. That is a #climatefact
2667 2018-04-27 18:01:58 2 boiled eggs, green olives, feta cheese, tomatoes, pasta, peppers, falafel. Bit of olive oil.
2668 2018-04-27 18:01:53 It annoys me that the UK has been crying out for a ppv of any sort for years and it’s just oil money that talks it would appear….

2670 2018-04-27 18:01:40 Come on now David. Unbalanced? All the major oil companies are knuckle deep in each major college and university and trade school in this province. This isn’t going to cause any issues on the ground or their messaging. Does the “Big” in Big Oil refer to insecurity? #RollsEyes

2675 2018-04-27 18:01:30 So now you gonna mansplain rapeseed oil to us?
2676 2018-04-27 18:01:19 If i were this Jimy Fallon character, i'd grow magnificent jet black wings, each feather more sinewy & oil slathe….
2677 2018-04-27 18:00:54 Transmission fluid is the special oil used in the hydraulic transmission unit of your vehicle.
2678 2018-04-27 18:00:43 An unholy alliance of the economic incompetent and luddite little englanders all whipped into a frenzy by a racist snake oil salesman. What could possibly go wrong?
2679 2018-04-27 18:00:40 Again net to Canada this project reduces emissions per barrel right now. It takes the oil off rail cars and out of trucks using a more carbon efficient method to get it to market.
2680 2018-04-27 18:00:38 I don’t know know why people assume that all women don’t take care of their vehicles. In a week I have put brand new tires on my 300, oil change, alignment, detailed, new policy, and registration with time still before my birthday.  You will know when I pull up 
2681 2018-04-27 18:00:33 Who r u calling ignorant? This is not because of chemtrails, it's oil and grease in our atmosphere(think oilspill in the sunshine) because there is another planet between us and our Sun.
2682 2018-04-27 18:00:25 Sad spectacle: 

Question:  What about out of work oil workers?
PM:  We stand behind a woman's right to choose!
Question:  Why are our tax dollars funding anti-pipeline activists?
PM:  Um, reproductive rights.  Yeah, that's it, and we'll never apologize. Never!
#cdnpoli #ableg
2683 2018-04-27 18:00:15 If (when) KM pipeline is expanded. Metro Vancouver will pay more for gas. KM
has permission to double their toll charge on the bitumen/oil they pipe to BC & tanker to the US. US will of course, raise gas prices, & we'll all blame Premier Horgan & enviros - perfect scam.
2684 2018-04-27 18:00:12 Hi, where do you see Crude Oil heading to in the near term? Whether the charts r bright for the crude oil?
2685 2018-04-27 18:00:09 Crude Oil Prices (04-27-2018)
WTI: $68.27 (+0.08) 
Brent: $74.89 (+0.15)

2686 2018-04-27 18:00:01 Thank you Oil.
2687 2018-04-27 17:59:44 edibles that are made with rick simpson oil are honestly the best ever
2688 2018-04-27 17:59:42 Your mcm don’t even know how to check his oil
2689 2018-04-27 17:59:38 All players wanted a higher oil prices except the poor consumers 
They have to adjust and ride the wave
2690 2018-04-27 17:59:33 If you read the information that was submitted and reviewed I am certain your trust level would switch. And just to be clear I neither work for an oil company, nor are are any of my current contracts associated with work for one. I am a purely unbiased 3rd party who has read it.
2691 2018-04-27 17:59:31 Well hello, oil drill dude. Pardon me if I don't friend you. Good on you for graduating uni in 1953 and going to Oxford and whatnot #facebook
2692 2018-04-27 17:59:14 "Perspective."
2693 2018-04-27 17:59:09 Your mumu done do are you going to vote for that person that called you lazy people only waiting for oil produce hahaha If your mumu never do think very well
2694 2018-04-27 17:58:49 I've been told that gas prices always go up around this time because due to EPA regulations, oil companies have to switch over to a different gas "blend" due to the seasons changing. I live in AZ tho so we don't have seasons
2695 2018-04-27 17:58:48 The only type of Highlight I got on me is the sun reflecting off the oil from my face.

2697 2018-04-27 17:58:32 #ArborDay celebrates trees' vital role in our planet's environment. At the state pension fund, we’re convincing corporations to only use products, like palm oil, that are certified free from #deforestation, which is a major contributor to climate change
2698 2018-04-27 17:58:31 I can't wait, especially after how smooth and accident-free the above-ground oil pipelines have been. 
2699 2018-04-27 17:58:26 Saba nalayak v's oil??? Yuck.... 
2700 2018-04-27 17:58:21 Of course, the 2 party system is basically a 1 party system who works for the arms industry, Big Oil, & other special interests that bribe them with "donations"...not for the American people. We desperately need more people to wake up and break out of this system.
2701 2018-04-27 17:58:11 What is there with oil better than cement from Tororo how has cement worked for us for 1000s of years of mining?

2705 2018-04-27 17:57:24 Helium 3 is on the moon I think. Isn’t that a potential energy source for fusion reactors. Anything that could eliminate fossil fuels is a big No no. It’s about money. We can’t lose the dependency of oil IMO.
2706 2018-04-27 17:57:24 When I was in high school it became about the oil.
2707 2018-04-27 17:57:22 Most were snake oil salesmen. Although cool costumes. Most died of the plague. Which by the way, is curable now with antibiotics. Have you been tested for allergies? I used to be sick all the time, didn't know most was caused by being allergic to many things.
2708 2018-04-27 17:57:17 Fun fact: my grandpa worked for the state department during the time where the US was moving away from using whale oil. He helped draft regulating laws that are still in use today so that whales aren’t over harvested.
2709 2018-04-27 17:57:12 Only if we raise the draft age
2710 2018-04-27 17:56:50 Of course. It’s what Putin wants, because it would drive the price of oil up to $100 a barrel. That’s the magic number.
2711 2018-04-27 17:56:26 @GrantMBeasley Grant mentioned buy side PM's had meeting in April to determine new allocation. Sure looks based on. Oil and gas sector price appreciation and bids is where those funds went in Canada. You could see the buildup. Metals are next but might need 2 mths
2712 2018-04-27 17:56:24 Wait is the Oil Rumble seriously happening on world women's wrestling day? That's fucked up
2713 2018-04-27 17:56:03 The worstall that oil
2714 2018-04-27 17:56:03 Oh I eat any can of tuna that wanders into my field of vision, assuming it’s solid white albacore in water. I have fought multiple cans of chunk light in oil so don’t even test me
2715 2018-04-27 17:56:02 Gorgeous and sexy, but I hate baby oil. It is so fricken sticky and slimy afterwards.
2716 2018-04-27 17:55:51 Also. IRAN has arguably the LARGEST OIL DEPOSITS left in the world.
2717 2018-04-27 17:55:44 Listen, they're named for the spermaceti, the stuff inside their head, that was used to make whale oil which was used in many many products until it fell out of fashion.

Also they thought spermaceti was sperm.
2718 2018-04-27 17:55:27 @CharlieBerens still coming to town after the crazy corporate oil explosion yesterday?
2719 2018-04-27 17:55:19 should I pull my diapers down and bend over?  There is plenty of baby oil, Vaseline to help it easily go in.
2720 2018-04-27 17:55:16 Inside the bear trap that is USD. Which is in a bull trap of gold? Or oil? I dunno. I’m going long on fools for the next year or so.
2721 2018-04-27 17:55:14 Who said I wasn’t? I’m not a supply sider. Of course I worry about deficits. Especially when money that could be invested in education to lift everyone up is instead handed to corporate fat cats and on wars for oil. I think you need to read more closely.
2722 2018-04-27 17:55:14 let’s talk about how in the month of April my car got totaled, my brothers car broke down, my dads car completely ran out of oil, and my moms care got hit in a parking lot
2723 2018-04-27 17:55:08 The company discussed in the article is EOG. From their history page:

1999:
EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), formerly Enron Oil & Gas Company, adopted a new name and declared its independence from Enron Corp
2724 2018-04-27 17:54:55 some truths must remain unspoken 
2725 2018-04-27 17:54:54 1/2 Currently the Oil Sands projects only use 75% of their allowed carbon as you refer to it. And not accounting for projects underway to further reduce it we can increase production by 75% before it hits 100%. So other industries are using the carbon from these projects now
2726 2018-04-27 17:54:51 Offering a scientific panel on oil spills, but the liberal’s own minister of natural resource still cant answer if bitumen sinks in water
2727 2018-04-27 17:54:44 @mariannaparraga chavez and kennedy got a lot of publicity when Venez shipped several cargoes of free (!) heating oil to the northeast usa. why doesn't anyone remember or mention this?  it was shameful and fraudulent on both of their part!  chavez stole from the Venezuelan people
2728 2018-04-27 17:54:25 But kenapa ramai dermatologist ckp lain? Yg oily xperlu moisturizer.. why?? Cos they said, ada research yg mengatakan if you terlalu depends on moisturizer, smpai bila2 kulit u kena pakai moisturizer,if tak pakai jd kering. Sbb skin kita dh xnk produce natural oil. Ahh pening..
2729 2018-04-27 17:54:17 ... white! and it ain't rubbing off!  ;-)

2732 2018-04-27 17:54:08 spending has gone up and down. oil has been a small part of the UK economy

2747 2018-04-27 17:52:26 That's like saying that because there is no specific study saying that eating a combination of cheese, basil, tomato, and olive oil is safe, then I should not eat Caprese salad.
2748 2018-04-27 17:52:25 Metal in the oil, damage from shipping/transport  are real events - not saying it’s the issue but there are possibilities beyond Alan just mailing it in.
2749 2018-04-27 17:52:21 Coal probably has more of a need. I do not think with hundreds of billions in profit that oil company’s need them. I would be a proponent for ending those. Coal, to keep Americans mining it instead of buying abroad. I could stand behind that.
2750 2018-04-27 17:52:21 Please understand everything you said is what the Green Party already knows. The reason for focusing on oil right now is because of the Kinder Morgan expansion.
2751 2018-04-27 17:52:20 take out the oil price decrease and Dat and ll sighted mega projects and international deals killed us

2754 2018-04-27 17:51:41 No one believe the mainstream fakenews which we all are confronted with. The really interesting fact is that the( oil and water fields) are still kept and its no IS anymore to shoot down.
2755 2018-04-27 17:51:33 Y’all really need to stop giving these snake oil salesmen and fake deep cats any country.
2756 2018-04-27 17:51:12 Exactly!! Sounds like an advocacy group that gets supported by big oil 
2757 2018-04-27 17:51:06 So, trump prolly wants 1) any association with Obama erased from it, 2) large $ and fame for him, 3) all of Iran’s oil, and 4) bombing as much of Iran as possible.  

That would be his “mission accomplished.”
2758 2018-04-27 17:50:56 By all means. I'll buy the oil. 
2759 2018-04-27 17:50:39 Don’t know if you noticed, but oil prices on the international market crashed. That wasn’t Trudeau's doing.

2768 2018-04-27 17:49:49 Despite capex of USD 10 bn per quarter, production is falling at around 5%. And cash flow from operation did not improve from last year despite strong oil. Depletion is huge for XOM.
2769 2018-04-27 17:49:44 I use cinnamon essential oil.  I put three drops in a veggie capsule & take it every morn. Black pepper essential oil is great too. I use doTERRA oils. If U check them out & want 2 buy w/a 25% discount, I can set U up a Wholesale Account. It isn’t 4 “selling” just paying less.

2773 2018-04-27 17:49:15 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
2774 2018-04-27 17:49:03 Apply almond oil before sleeping
2775 2018-04-27 17:48:54 would have left an oil slick. 
2776 2018-04-27 17:48:30 My app will create a new oil market 
2777 2018-04-27 17:48:11 Coconut oil has melted, we have officially entered the good times.
2778 2018-04-27 17:47:54 Occupy Nigeria was more about a lack of trust in the government of the day than economics of oil subsidy
2779 2018-04-27 17:47:48 Even when your partner drops a 45 on your foot?
2780 2018-04-27 17:47:43 :( I didn't see this yet. Imma have to get more details. Sad how another oil spill seems so common that we don't even bother to splash it on the national news....smh.
2781 2018-04-27 17:47:40 Hi James - our ultimate fries are indeed gluten free but we cannot gaurantee there is no cross contamination because they share cooking oil with our onion rings and tempura zucchini. Hope this helps!
2782 2018-04-27 17:47:31 i hate that my short ass gay to climb on the counter in order to reach the vegetable oil
2783 2018-04-27 17:47:22 Ladies you have $5 to build the perfect man:

$300 - handsome
$200 - educated
$400 - wealthy
$1 - chickpeas
$1 - tahini
$1 - olive oil
$1 - garlic
$1 - lemon juice
$500 - strong
2784 2018-04-27 17:47:16 Maffew is calling this the "Oil Rumble" and that's perfect IMO
2785 2018-04-27 17:47:13 Oil Rumble is the greatest thing ever said about this Saudi PPV event. Classic. #WWEGRR
2786 2018-04-27 17:47:11 I see now Salamanca and Tula tar also for mex means all of them - shud keep a bid for Mogas along with all that is going on gulf coast. #gasoline #Oil
2787 2018-04-27 17:46:56 No matter how much oil/how many cotton pads you used you’d still have glitter everywhere
2788 2018-04-27 17:46:46 “...to hold in the mind two opposing ideas, believing them both...”-Orwell
2789 2018-04-27 17:46:31 I'll be going with 4 packs, oil sheen, mango butter, and luxurious edges. 
2790 2018-04-27 17:46:30 You know what's fundamentally unfair? Destroying our planet for profits, Flint Mich, manipulating markets for profits ie pharmaceutical and Oil companies all for the greedy get richer and us consumers suffer for it. All with no wage increases= dollar doesn't buy what it use to
2791 2018-04-27 17:46:26 Noo choćby  i był indiańskiego pochodzenia, to PRAWDA człowieku o tej katastrofie MUSI być przedstawiona Polakom i odpowiedzialni jej MUSZA ponieść KONSEKWENCJE!!! Tak samo jakby to był Twój ulubiony prezydent. BO BYL POLSKIM PREZYDENTEM czy Ci się to podoba lub nie. Pozdrawiam.
2792 2018-04-27 17:46:22 Canola oil is only used by people who don’t wear shoes on airplanes.
2793 2018-04-27 17:46:13 Just saw someone refer to Greatest Royal Rumble as the Oil Rumble and yeah, that's the winner.
2794 2018-04-27 17:46:07 @Rajendr76194898 
 राज तुमने देखा की नही कनॉटक मे मोदीजी का पुतला जलाने गया स्टाइल मार रहा था इन के हाथ मे oil की शीशी हाथ मे थी  इनके ही दोस्त ने आग लगा दी  देखो चौधरी जी ने भेजा हे विडियो
2795 2018-04-27 17:46:05 Washing less and morocaan oil is whats saving me !! Haha
2796 2018-04-27 17:46:03 how is the show going? Considering that fact that it is probably being booked by oil money. Wonder if the guy is a Rusev fan
2797 2018-04-27 17:45:44 He’s probably in pain, that scream is real
2798 2018-04-27 17:45:42 I'll let you read up on the placebo effect. I don't have time to tutor someone on the internet who claims to be a doctor. A good start would be the book "snake oil science" by R. Barker Bausell. Very good introduction to the issue in the context of clinical studies.
2799 2018-04-27 17:45:41 So tired of Nigerians selling Shea butter. We can do sooooooo much more in that natural/organic air space. Sick of coconut oil too.

2802 2018-04-27 17:45:24 (Cont'ing from previous reply)
PS: ur pimp must be fried in oil regardless of whether u got educated or not. Any pimp. It takes a devilish cruelty to sell a girl's/woman's flesh like that, not to mention pocketing the lion's share of the blood money.
2803 2018-04-27 17:45:24 McNaughton's rendirion of the pee tape will be Trump anointing prostitutes with oil and slaying them in the spirit
2804 2018-04-27 17:45:14 Thanks @astoldbypatra for putting me on the EcoStyler argan oil gel.....sooooooo much better than the olive oil one. I'm mad I'm just getting around to it lol
2805 2018-04-27 17:45:02 True you can't trade charged batteries like you trade oil. But (renewable) electric power can be traded over HVDC links, and BEV's and many other loads can provide demand response. Renewable energy is a distributed recource in contrast to oil.
2806 2018-04-27 17:44:55 You just need to address your palm oil and deforestation issues now then.
2807 2018-04-27 17:44:51 NNPC to spend more on subsidy as rising oil price increases petrol landing costs

The expected open market price (EOMP) of Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) being imported into Nigeria may have risen above N190 as crude oil prices climbed towards a four-year high of $75 per barrel
2808 2018-04-27 17:44:45 Any difference between"raising of oil prices"by oil producing countries including US shale oil lobby from"royalties/charges"fixed by technology&other IPrights holders over their consumers?Both impose prices unconnected with cost of production free market prices robbing consumers?
2809 2018-04-27 17:44:42 Poor some baby oil by the door so they slip
2810 2018-04-27 17:44:41 Not watching the Oil Rumble b/c I’m waiting for Fallout 4 to install on @LonLonKitty’s PS4 and they have these wee films that are probably a lot more entertaining than the Fed’s love letter to Saudi Arabia
2811 2018-04-27 17:44:37 Detox your body like you change the oil in your car!
Ask me about my 30 day body cleanse 
2812 2018-04-27 17:44:28 Oil Rumble. Beautiful stuff sir
2813 2018-04-27 17:44:27 It's like a greek amphorae for olive oil..
2814 2018-04-27 17:44:20 just lube up tbh. we've got a jar of coconut oil on the bedside table and it comes in handy, no pun intended
2815 2018-04-27 17:44:10 Guh I’m just really scared. I put wild growth oil and coconut oil on my hair
2816 2018-04-27 17:44:10 If you like a lot of olive oil on your biscuit, join our club!
2817 2018-04-27 17:44:09 …should people notice, though? Or do I want to go to bed at a reasonable hour?

Do you have an "immanetization/impending nap" oil that could accomplished such a thing? Maybe put it in my shampoo?
2818 2018-04-27 17:44:06 sorry you get oil next time not to day
2819 2018-04-27 17:43:57 COCONUT OIL IS L I F E

2825 2018-04-27 17:43:25 How many consumers asked for palm oil to be included in products? It as been foisted on us by manufacturers. It should be banned.
2826 2018-04-27 17:43:20 Anyone else in Pgh bummed aht gas is $3.09 a gallon? All this winning is kinda tough. My tax break was spent on a fill up. I guess that happens when the ex Sec of State was an oil guy. The 1% is looking out for you, ask Pruitt. #trumpersyouwerebamboozled #
2827 2018-04-27 17:42:40 Where are we going to get the money for @BernieSanders proposals? Let's ask the oil companies and the banks. They have all your money. #thornycroftdiatribe #MedicareForAll #Bernie2020 @TulsiGabbard
2828 2018-04-27 17:42:38 Maybe give up on the green one. My hair use to look like a hot MESS with that green one, but you see the argan oil one? LAID. I would snap or do a video to send on whatsapp and show how i do my hair

2830 2018-04-27 17:42:15 @caveofbeauty @LaBeautyologist can carrot oil be used on oily skin ? During the daytime ? Can oils in general be used during the daytime? I also read that oil should be the last step because if not it will create a barrier and won’t allow the other products sink in. Is this true?
2831 2018-04-27 17:42:11 So my oil changes are 80 dollars with this car instead of like 35 lmao

2833 2018-04-27 17:41:59 Oil is like wine because it’s fermentation but dinosaurs instead of grapes
2834 2018-04-27 17:41:59 Why are ppl adding shitty drawn shapes on their insta pictures why are ppl adding rainbow oil spills on their insta pictures why are ppl
2835 2018-04-27 17:41:54 You really don't understand what a sweetheart deal oil & Gas companies get when it comes to tax breaks and subsidies, do you?
2836 2018-04-27 17:41:46 i can’t even smell tea tree oil
2837 2018-04-27 17:41:45 Controls the valve that lets a little oil flow for burning?
2838 2018-04-27 17:41:38 What should be investigated is the left's collusion with Russia to spread Climate Change and Global Warming propaganda to derail the U.S.'s efforts to produce our own oil.
2839 2018-04-27 17:41:09 one time i slept with coconut oil in my hair and a shower cap on and in the morning my dad saw and told me he liked my cool hat
2840 2018-04-27 17:40:58 puf puf has too much oil...
2841 2018-04-27 17:40:54 Life hack: When the pollen won't let you be great..... eucalyptus, lemon, and peppermint essential oil in a steaming pot works wonders. If you have it bad invest in an oil diffuser so it can run while you sleep. Thanks Kia Weaver Byrd for the info!
2842 2018-04-27 17:40:49 Their switching too solar because of cheap bid by Sakaka. Allowing them to export all their subsidized oil they would have used at home for full export market value. Reducing their carbon, but increasing world carbon per Paris accord. Total BS Jeffie! #climatefaux
2843 2018-04-27 17:40:47 Not sure how you come up with the 50% calculation.

2846 2018-04-27 17:40:05 Having Anxiety is no joke... I've been off work since Monday and it's now Friday and i just finished my last errand which was car wash/oil change. The day before I got a hair cut/shopping 2nd time. Shopping the first time wasn't until Tuesday... having to live 1 day at a time
2847 2018-04-27 17:39:53 I see...So keep coal, don't worry about emissions. Moneys good. Oil through pipelines and sealed tankers bad....but by rail, ok. BC large export good regardless. Alberta oil bad...regardless. I see your point
2848 2018-04-27 17:39:42 Between Big Oil and Ethanol companies Americans are being ripped off at the pump  by these scumbags , If you live in one of the 12 major cities buy a Electric Car , no pollution 150 miles per charge less than 3 bucks . Look at all the fuel and pollution by cars stuck in traffic
2849 2018-04-27 17:39:36 Autocorrect, stop changing lil to oil. I meant what I said.
2850 2018-04-27 17:39:32 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
2851 2018-04-27 17:39:24 Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated, they only want to sit down and enjoy oil money, I think this is a hate speech from PMB to Nigerian youths. What is the penalty for that offence again?
2852 2018-04-27 17:39:23 ok I bought the package of pre cut extra firm cubes then u drain, press w/ a paper towel to get the extra water out then toss em with soy sauce. then pre heat a pan w/ vegetable oil cook for 7 mins on the first side then 4 on the other !!!
2853 2018-04-27 17:39:18 Oil finish!

2856 2018-04-27 17:39:04 SOS. Need peppermint oil 
2857 2018-04-27 17:39:01 I used almond flour (lol no flour either), salt, lemon juice, ricotta cheese, honey, stevia (sweetener), xylitol (another sweetener), oil, butter flavor extract (hahaha no butter), egg yolks, and almond milk. + v+)9

Mix it all up and bake, then refrigerate till dense.
2858 2018-04-27 17:38:56 Maybe: Add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil, next add the Sea Cucumbers and cook for 2 minutes, drain, set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a wok/pan until hot, add the 4 spring onions , 6 slices ginger and stir-fry until it starts to release its fragrance. Lots of Wasabi!
2859 2018-04-27 17:38:54 The amount of folks that won't do even the slightest amount of research is amazing.  Iran got access to their own oil revenue money that the US locked down. There were also other provisions that the US is getting ready to back out on while Iran remains compliant.

2865 2018-04-27 17:38:21 Don’t oil bro

2872 2018-04-27 17:37:33 A) It WAS a participation trophy; his Oval Office seat was still cold. B) No doubt Pres. Trump was instrumental in any strides made with NK, yet Dems, MSM, and Judas Republicans still looking for ways to take him down. Swamp needs to be covered in oil and set afire.

2880 2018-04-27 17:36:51 This is very good. This will free India from clutches of oil economy. We need them more in India. Hope Ashok Leyland & Tata Motors are listening.
2881 2018-04-27 17:36:48 i turned abbachios wine into olive oil. thats for the piss you dick
2882 2018-04-27 17:36:27 Between Big Oil and Ethanol companies americans are getting ripped off at the pump . If you live in one of the 12 major cities drive less than 150 miles a day no reason to not buy a Electric car .The Nissan Leaf get 150 miles on a charge that cost less than 3 dollars in electric
2883 2018-04-27 17:36:17 So we just encourage the use of more oil?
2884 2018-04-27 17:36:01 I'm writing a story about a guy who, whilst endeavoring to exact revenge on those who wrongfully had him imprisoned, dies in a tragic hot oil incident. I'm calling it: The Count of Molten Crisco.
2885 2018-04-27 17:35:54 I am not against batteries. But I m trying to bring some balance and logics. Of course it will be both, but batteries aren’t like oil. You can’t trade energy across oceans world wide with batteries really. Like you can with oil and hydrogen.
2886 2018-04-27 17:35:51 Tell Loop Putin supports Assad because he wants to put a pipeline for oil through Syria
2887 2018-04-27 17:35:37 and he also continued the war for oil in the middle-east because sees them as "shit hole" countries & is on the verge of starting World War 3 now. Oh yeah and he also thinks US "needs more nuclear weapons". He is just going to accelerate things to Armageddon. 
2888 2018-04-27 17:35:26 Playing with fire: Iran deal looms over rising oil price...
2889 2018-04-27 17:35:22 The captain of the MV Ever Judger, a Chinese national identified only as ZD, 50, has been named a suspect in the Balikpapan oil spill.

2891 2018-04-27 17:35:12 I don’t know where the erudite midday guys on The Score guys think water comes from. Roquan clearly wasn’t out in a pasture drilling for oil.
2892 2018-04-27 17:35:06 me, someone whose oil glands were being murdered for six months straight by medication: wow my face is glowing accutane really came thru
my face: it’s the grease

my face: the GREASE
2893 2018-04-27 17:35:05 As far as I know, the people who hate on truffle oil are the same people who looooove coconut water & I don’t have time for their negativity in my life
2894 2018-04-27 17:34:54 Here’s the thing, if we end the Iran deal it makes it tougher for them to sell their oil, as they would immediately restart their nuclear program and Trump would then immediately re-impose the old sanctions against them.Reneging on the Iran deal is one more way Trump serves Putin
2895 2018-04-27 17:34:41 @JimIrsay could you do us firefighters a huge favor and open Lucas Oil Stadium roof for our climb today?
2896 2018-04-27 17:34:37 It's a very interesting hypothesis. Not quite sure how much I buy into it yet, tho, since oil is still used so ubiquitously.
2897 2018-04-27 17:34:27 ตอนที่ไม่มีใครก็อยู่ได้ ไม่เห็นตาย
2898 2018-04-27 17:34:18 Yes but do they have Palm Oil in them? I would be prepared to pay that bit more so there is no Palm Oil in the products. The rainforests are going along with wildlife all for this Palm Oil.
2899 2018-04-27 17:34:08 I asked a store assoCIAte at PUBIX today if they sold PUSSY ENERGY DRINK like on AMAzon!  She sent me to the NUTZ aisle!   @Publix I WANT PUSSY in PUBUX!  HEMP OIL is legal in all 50 states & pubLICKs don't have THC 0.03% OIL!
2900 2018-04-27 17:34:06 heaven forbid the oil industry even be slightly hampered in their ability to print money. Fuck the ocean amirite?
2901 2018-04-27 17:33:41 A grace period on Chinese loans to Venezuela has lapsed, according to two Venezuelan sources with knowledge of the matter, potentially depriving the cash-strapped OPEC nation of billions of dollars in desperately needed oil revenue this year.
2902 2018-04-27 17:33:40 I love how people like you, who live their daily lives consuming oil, scrutinize everything that happens in Alberta. No wildlife affected but that doesn't matter. There was a spill. World is ending. Continue to view life through your rose-coloured, hypocritical glasses :)
2903 2018-04-27 17:33:36 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2904 2018-04-27 17:33:31 A grace period on Chinese loans to Venezuela has lapsed, according to two Venezuelan sources with knowledge of the matter, potentially depriving the cash-strapped OPEC nation of billions of dollars in desperately needed oil revenue this year.
2905 2018-04-27 17:33:29 NO No NO NOOO!

I'v tired this model ?

I'm To Tall at 6'2" to get legs under steering Wheel, Bum not reach seat !

2906 2018-04-27 17:33:28 Get a Electric car , The New Nissan Leaf is really nice even though you limited to 150 miles on a charge , its less than 3 bucks to charge and if your a local or city driver this will pay in the end your not getting ripped off at the pump between big oil and Ethanol rip off scum
2907 2018-04-27 17:33:28 it is. Feel so much for those parents making decisions none of us parents would ever wish to make. 

And so I have nothing but bitterness and bile for people using tragedy in a completely ill-informed manner to peddle their own snake oil
2908 2018-04-27 17:33:25 Only if the USD keeps weakening.  See my chart earlier today of oil v inverted USD.
2909 2018-04-27 17:33:22 You sell “Annointing Oil?”  By any chance do you sell “Do-It-Yourself Home Exorcism Kits?”  Asking for a friend...  (also do you buy slightly used books, like “DIY Demon Summoning for Fun & Profit?”  Again, for a friend...)
2910 2018-04-27 17:33:19 Not a fan of coal but ecological and economical damage from coal spills on the coast is not even in the same league as a heavy oil spill.
2911 2018-04-27 17:33:08 @PaulBurstow thanks for the letter. Not convinced you wrote to me personally. Would rather boil my bollocks in oil than vote for your three. #suttonbinshame people don't forget.
2912 2018-04-27 17:33:04 Not watching #WWEGRR because Saudi oil money isn't anything to be celebrated. The fact some WWE employees can't attend because they'd be arrested on the spot, and none of the women are allowed to appear at all, should be all the warning you need to know to not support this event.
2913 2018-04-27 17:33:01 just my luck that I’m tanning while studying and my tanning oil spilt all over my notes. lo mf l

2916 2018-04-27 17:32:52 How about changing your own oil? Is that out, too?
2917 2018-04-27 17:32:48 A DOCUMENT, ALL RIGHT, IT IS SMALL POTATOES. It IS RIGHT NOW. Can't BE ANY WORSE. But I ALWAYS SAID KEEP THE OIL. You LEAVE, YOU KEEP THE OIL. So WHO HAS THE OIL IS HAD BY ISIS.
2918 2018-04-27 17:32:48 And my oil is changed 
2919 2018-04-27 17:32:17 what kind of oil pattern are they using?
2920 2018-04-27 17:32:15 @Wrenchmasters what brand of synthetic oil do you use? Can it be purchased in a 4 l container somewhere?
2921 2018-04-27 17:31:35 I don't think I've ever felt like such a Californian than at this moment. I have never seen a live Turkey in real life. They've always been from the freezer. 
2922 2018-04-27 17:31:29 You mean oil based economies. When you say resource, it sounds like you're talking about fish, lumber, gold, etc etc.
2923 2018-04-27 17:31:16 I’m tired AF and these guys at the oil change place communicate by SCREAMING at each other. I’m hangry & feeling real crabby #nottodaysatan
2924 2018-04-27 17:31:12 What shall I do to atone this big error? What kinda sacrifice shall I make to appease the gods? How many goats, drums of palm oil and yards of white clothes will it require?

2926 2018-04-27 17:30:57 WRONG!! CFR Tittle 21 section 501.22 sub 3 The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or vegetable.

2933 2018-04-27 17:30:33 Olive oil edge control reminds me of hall parties in the East and 10th grade.
2934 2018-04-27 17:30:24 the hypocrisy of the BC government & environmental alarmists position is that the Oilsands bitumen and Alberta heavy oil is an issue, yet they totally ignore all the tanker, barge and rail traffic with all the oil & petroleum from the USA etc in the strait of Juan de Fuca.

can you not read vip
2937 2018-04-27 17:30:15 But "oil imperialism" has no place in the excerpt. The excerpt is strictly islamophobic, claiming "they would kill us if they could". So somehow for you the preface changes this excerpt into a commentary on imperialism. I still don't see it.
2938 2018-04-27 17:30:07 Hilary is a lesser evil than Trump for sure tho. Both would have continued the war for oil in the Middle-East but at least Hilary would have had more humanitarian social policies inside the state. Thats just how it is man. Trump is just a complete dumbass & thats very dangerous.

2943 2018-04-27 17:29:13 Disagree.  If we keep #oil as the present, there will not be a future.  @bcliberals remain in denial, mainly to please big donors.  This must stop.  #kindermorgan #bcpoli
2944 2018-04-27 17:29:09 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

2951 2018-04-27 17:28:05 like a spa, basically they put u a steam room for a while then scrub you real good with black soap & then wash you & rub you with scented oil, and u can actually see dead skin coming out while they scrub u its really good you come out fresh and clean w skin like a new born baby

2959 2018-04-27 17:27:25 Noble sentiment Greg. I forsee some issues.
Who do you imagine will supply the armaments? Upgrades? Maintenance? Ammunition? Why would they do this if we refuse to participate? 
Why are we in ME? We are stealing oil and securing the trade route. It was never abt WMD's.
2960 2018-04-27 17:27:12 We spend that much money in wars for oil, not freedom.
2961 2018-04-27 17:26:59 I'm losing my mind...
2962 2018-04-27 17:26:54 Weird misquote...

I think the original should be taught to children in life skills classes, right beside doing taxes, changing your own oil, and growing something edible.  It's definitely in the "quotable ideas" book I've started for my grandchildren.
2963 2018-04-27 17:26:33 นอนก็นอนไม่หลับ อยากจะข่มตาหลับ..
2964 2018-04-27 17:26:33 Intersectional social justice (aka; "PoC") is so fucking useless and annoying. We out here getting executed and you think the Marriott not having olive oil shampoo is a real issue?
2965 2018-04-27 17:26:27 It’s probably criminal. They’re taking our kids money and giving it to oil companies and high earners- sounds like theft to me

2968 2018-04-27 17:25:43 If China can pay for oil in CNY, how many UST's do they need to hold going forward?  Don't know the answer, but I do know China has 26% of GDP in FX reserves while the only other nation that can print ccy for oil (the US) holds 0.6% of GDP in FX rsvs.  ie watch LIBOR, US rates...
2969 2018-04-27 17:25:40 Please understand that oil is not the only fossil fuel ,let us stop the backyard fire pits, the campground fires and the wood burning fireplaces and stoves that look so nice. Lakes created by damming rivers also contribute to change @CanadianGreens @ElizabethMay #UuseOil2
2970 2018-04-27 17:25:39 You just described scotlands position in the union where scots oil and gas has propped up the UK for decades.
WM has turned an oil rich UK into a debt mess
Can you imagine the state WM would have UK in if there was no Scottish resources to plunder?

2973 2018-04-27 17:25:04 These are like oil paintings of The Onion's satirical op-ed cartoons except completely earnest.
2974 2018-04-27 17:24:55 Try mineral oil.
2975 2018-04-27 17:24:54 Facctsss, bitch can ask me bout an oil change and I’ll reference head 
2976 2018-04-27 17:24:36 I do a full scoop of vega sport vanilla protein with a banana, a handful of baby spinach, almond milk, and and a tablespoon of flax seed oil. with whey protein I just do it with almond milk bc it doesn't mix well with anything else
2977 2018-04-27 17:24:32 Gettin an oil change. This officer looks like a young Kevin Bacon.
2978 2018-04-27 17:24:31 Btw, have you noticed that as soon as we elect A GOP president, gas goes up to $4 a gallon? They didn’t even wait for an excuse this time. They said, “Oh, Syria.” Syria isn’t an oil producing state. They did blow up a refinery, though, so we’ll be hitting $4 by July.
2979 2018-04-27 17:24:29 We'd stay clear of the face oil due to multiple irritants (lavender, clove, jasmine, etc.) but the eye version looks decent! Tomato extract has a small potential for irritation, but in such a low amount, you'd probably be OK. Patch test just in case! :)

2982 2018-04-27 17:24:19 And the corporations that in the oil & gas industry that is destroying our planet is also tax free...
2983 2018-04-27 17:24:07 Because they get some amount of free oil from Saudi Arabia and some at subsidised price in return Saudi can use their nukes because they invested in paks's nukes
2984 2018-04-27 17:23:30 OMG! Now infrastructure planning is going to tank. Everything @HillaryClinton touches goes down in flames.

2987 2018-04-27 17:23:21 The Colorado Oil and Gas Act has never been challenged in court on a constitutional basis.

2991 2018-04-27 17:23:06 RT StandingRockST: “An oil spill would be devastating for our culture and traditions. Our prayers, plants, and water are all tied together.

- Iran doesn't have nukes.
- Iran is in ME.
- Iran has a lot of oil & gas.
- Israel wants unchallenged.
- Saudi Arabia paying off the US.
- US wants obedience from all.
- US preparing for future war with China.

3011 2018-04-27 17:20:13 Tip for ladies and people often assumed to be ladies:
When you're adding anything to your car (oil, washer fluid, etc) and a man asks if you need help, say, "nah, just topping off the headlight fluid, thanks."
3012 2018-04-27 17:20:08 #HairTipFriday ! Give yourself an oil hair massage from time to time with any kind of oil, coconut, almond, olive, etc.,

3019 2018-04-27 17:19:32 Yeah, of course it was. Public spending cuts started not long after the oil was discovered, but keep telling yourself Thatcherism and its descendants are better for Scotland.

3072 2018-04-27 17:14:50 When pipeline access to quebec became available for suncor, they brought in oil from the tar sands. I'm sure Valero did the same with their oil from the US. before that most oil was imported via tanker. The infrastructure @DavidSuzuki is fighting has allowed CN use its own oil.
3073 2018-04-27 17:14:49 @SusanSarandon why are you so antagonistic sometimes, yet you voted for Jill Stein = big oil= Russia?? You went to Standing Rock! Explain that, when you voted for big oil. Love you, just don’t agree with your thinking.

3103 2018-04-27 17:11:44 Good comments. $XOM Exxon Mobil is down for 2 wrong reasons. 
1. Investors believe gas acquisition makes it exceptionally dependent on gas. Even 100% oil plays are 25% gas
2. Investors cheer up pure play refiner but oddly see XOM as not leveraged to oil

3110 2018-04-27 17:11:17 Seemingly, we're supposed to keep quiet about our issues. As for the trade wars, it has nothing to do with us. Same with petrol, Saudi Arabia is controlling opec output with some cut and pushing the US to attack Syria and Iran so the price of oil can increase.

If you have itchy, irritated, or inflamed skin, smother yourself in coconut oil to provide relief. 

It’s hydrating components will penetrate the skin and bring ease to your skin. This is great if you catch a case of chicken pox or poison ivy.

3140 2018-04-27 17:09:16 I guess it would be when I turned 17.  My parents said they would get me a cheap used car.  It ended up being a 71 Oldsmobile Cutlas S.  A rust bucket that had holes in the floorboard, a speedo that did not work, and leaked and burned enough oil that I never had to change the oil
3141 2018-04-27 17:09:14 Best thing I ever did was volunteering! I got my current job off the back of several years volunteering in seabird rehab; I learned a huge amount about oil spill response and chemistry, veterinary care, and had amazing mentors.
3142 2018-04-27 17:08:57 Niiice!! I make my own balms because I am too poor to purchase. Looks great tho. I can't even afford my CBD oil, so maybe I will grow some hemp and press it. Sigh.
3143 2018-04-27 17:08:29 Details on the sanctions... look that up...but it consisted of...oil...not buying food(fish) from them ...bank related stuff as well. In the 90s Bill C. gave them money and reactor technology not to build nukes. They did anyways.
3144 2018-04-27 17:08:27 I'm sure many American companies don't pay taxes. TRUMP alone took a $970M loss so he wouldn't have to either.  And then there are companies, like big oil, who get subsidized ON TOP OF IT.

3189 2018-04-27 17:03:39 Low taxes for banks and big oil? Trilllions in debt for the rest to pay off?  Poor people don’t pay taxes. They have no income.
3190 2018-04-27 17:03:24 Russia kept up oil delivery. Prob food. But I’m sure not enough for the whole country.
3191 2018-04-27 17:03:20 Kudos to the Fireman checking my apartment smoke detectors who, after I show him to my room, realize I left out my coconut oil and other normally hidden away items. He then immediately starts talking rapidly about "those famous kids" in my FREAKS AND GEEKS poster.

3204 2018-04-27 17:02:16 Definitely. When I stopped straightening my hair I hit Costco and Trader Joe's and bought literally every oil I could and tried them all! Oils are one of those super personal things you must try to know how your hair likes it!
3205 2018-04-27 17:02:12 Oil free moisturizer! Also products that are designs for oily skin. I used to have really oily skin but when I found the right moisturizer, it actually helped control the oil since my skin didn’t have to make its own oil
3206 2018-04-27 17:02:00 I had a guy say “I love that you don’t wear makeup!” When I was wearing cat-eye eyeliner & fake lashes. Yes, my lips were natural or nude (60s style) but...srsly? Thank goodness for those sweet little dummies with their heads full of fluff and motor oil. Makes my job real easy.

3208 2018-04-27 17:01:47 I’ve never been able to walk away from getting my car serviced for something as simple as an oil change and tire rotation without them coming up to me with “issues” racking up to 600 dollars in charges. Lol no thanks

Why $XOM hasn’t risen with oil? It’s at the same level when oil was >$90 and EPS was significantly higher. Maybe it didn’t go down enough...???

We should NOT be allies with Russia until they change what they represent.

3278 2018-04-27 16:56:14 US oil prod. forecasts are reliant on shale.  It is feasible that those predictions exclude real mkt forces such as T/A cap, frac-cap, labor and geo decline. CAFE std's are at risk, and consumer fleet selection does not favor fuel efficiency. EV is greenfield predictions. IMO.
3279 2018-04-27 16:56:13 Challenge no doubt exacerbated by the ironic fact that Dubai's current prosperity, and grievous car-dependence, are founded entirely on oil.

3283 2018-04-27 16:55:37 Canada, at 1.6% of global emissions, is the wrong place to protest. Your time would be better spent elsewhere. Furthermore, across Canada and the world oil demand/consumption is up. Stopping local infrastructure like energy east and tmx only means foreign oil wins. Canada loses.

3288 2018-04-27 16:55:04 Macron says Libya has worked out fantastic for French Colonialism.  Had DC Warlords kick out the Chinese Oil companies and turned over wells and production to French company Total and Italian Eni.  War is a Racket. Colonial Imperialism lives on

3297 2018-04-27 16:53:41 Just as well the UK invested the income from the oil, like Norway did, eh? Oh. 
And meanwhile, Brexit looms, and the UK cuts its deficit by victimising disabled people and others living in poverty. Your choice maybe. Not mine.
3298 2018-04-27 16:53:12 Sure you do, up in Scotland.... and added benefit BP - which has the contract for the biggest oil fields in Iraq.
3299 2018-04-27 16:53:12 Oi, just cause I live near Aberdeen and smell of OIL!

3307 2018-04-27 16:52:08 You CONS need to realise that there are dissenting views, we do not all support Alberta's oil gluttony and people have to be prepared for a post fossil fuel world. Good on Trudeau for recognising that debate is essential and difference is beautiful.
3308 2018-04-27 16:51:59 Got my oil change finally
3309 2018-04-27 16:51:58 Current equity mkt obsession with all things tech, too, has a role in this. As few are invested in oil, few wish to hear about, promote, or even acknowledge higher fuel prices. There is a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil dystopia at play, in managed money, at the moment.
3310 2018-04-27 16:51:54 Wind and solar are the future, not dirty oil, gas, and coal. Get with the program, the Tesla has left the station and it’s not turning around.

3316 2018-04-27 16:50:46 Superb idea. They are great for doing an engine oil change.
3317 2018-04-27 16:50:39 Getting an oil change like an adult!
3318 2018-04-27 16:50:37 これ気になってて、ちょっと見たいと思ってる。
3319 2018-04-27 16:50:27 Reminds me a lot of appartheid in South Africa. I guess the reason why one is ok and one isn't is something to do with money and oil. Sad that society ignores morals when money talks
3320 2018-04-27 16:50:20 Great read. Snake oil peddlers
Sad but true
3321 2018-04-27 16:50:17 These people are acting like Bill Cosby the Sun of Ra drugged a bunch of KKK women with Shea Butter pills and impregnated them with his Black seed oil as punishment for  lynchings and cross burnings.
3322 2018-04-27 16:49:52 and the oil companies subsidies because they are in need...and the electric comapnies and of course walmart.
3323 2018-04-27 16:49:43 Hey @RealCanuck  Coal production currently represents over half of the total mineral production revenues in the province. Coal is B.C.'s largest single export commodity. Between 70-90 per cent of coal produced in B.C. is metallurgical coal. yeah oil coal. clean coal exports..
3324 2018-04-27 16:49:36 Have you ever been to a hotel casino in miss. The hotel shampoo years back was a oil made by three flowers.
3325 2018-04-27 16:49:35 I had to take my car to get an oil change today and I told my mom I’d get a lyft to work, and she bitched me out and said she’d take me and told me to pay her, smh
3326 2018-04-27 16:49:35 My grandma telling me she wants cannabis oil lol okay

3332 2018-04-27 16:48:46 There is an oil refinery about 35 miles from where I grew up. At night I could see the flame from the "waste gas" (methane and natural gas)  burn-off. 
Yrs, the EPA works for us.
3333 2018-04-27 16:48:42 @RachelNotley #ndp what is the timeline to either activate a provincial export tariff to cover demands for refineries insisted on or restriction on oil exports to BC? They show no signs of slowing. AB wants a timeline.  #ableg #abgov #cdnpoli
3334 2018-04-27 16:48:41 Breakfast TIP 101: When making Potatoes O Brien always use oil and a pan with no ridges! If you would like a video on how to make Fluffy scrambled eggs, potatoes o brien, bacon and toast in under 30 min COMMENT BELOW.  TAKES A FEW SECONDS TO LIKE AND COMMENT GO!!!!!! 
3335 2018-04-27 16:48:36 “Trying to find the courage to ask her out was like trying to get oil from a water spout.” 

Now trying to get a man to ask you on a real date is about like trying to get oil from a water spout. 
3336 2018-04-27 16:48:30  joked. Oh and I ran out of oil last night. Prolly 2 beard washew left in the shampoo.
3337 2018-04-27 16:48:29 Wow,for real...incredibly authentic, with the artwork and the paravent.. DAMN, this is going to be so epic p.s. are these stickers on the wall? ...and was it the oil wrestle pit ,you were waiting for to be delivered?
3338 2018-04-27 16:48:21 We should let Oil Princes hold wrestling events weekly
3339 2018-04-27 16:48:16 nice the big companies greedy groups get to pay off their debt with dollar that =less while we struggle to pay for the game of fake increase in oil prices and all that is tied to that. No wage increases etc. Sick of winning yet.
3340 2018-04-27 16:48:03 Story with @WendyWilliams “fat shaming” Kanye West? Cmere Love you’re no oil painting yourself. In face you have a face like a melted welly. Have a nice day x
3341 2018-04-27 16:47:57 I and many other progressives who protested the Bush family oil wars were well aware of what they did to NatSec and opposed the Patriot Act from the get, but sadly couldn't convince your ilk back then to climb aboard.  Guess we shoulda played up the race card more.

3342 2018-04-27 16:47:55 Sorry Fraser, doctors do not take these decisions lightly and Alfie's parents were delighted at the care he got. They listened to too many snake oil peddlers promising things they could not provide. #leave the child alone
3343 2018-04-28 23:59:53 Burned alive, incinerated. Yes that's what happens when you are forced to work in the largest German oil refinery in 1944-45, and the Allies reluctantly bomb it heavily, multiple times.  You get incinerated, burned whole the dictionary calls it.

3346 2018-04-28 23:59:29 He is totally right that it isn't investing. Like buying any currency or commodity, it's speculation. Bitcoin, on its own, and unlike a business, creates no value.

3350 2018-04-28 23:58:52 I hate getting my oil changed or anything fixed in my car because you always have to be on the defense for all of the other things they offer you. If I want to break down in the middle of the freeway that is my choice, now stop pressuring me dammit.
3351 2018-04-28 23:58:47 Didn’t Cheney get us oil contracts?
3352 2018-04-28 23:58:47 With the #10 Overall Pick Oil should move it for something that will help us now (Top 4 D, Top 6 F). If no deal makes sense keep it, but #Oilers need to have a win now mentality. #2018NHLDraft
3353 2018-04-28 23:58:42 I didn't expect them to win given their odds this year, but it would have been great to see the Oil pull it off one more time.

3360 2018-04-28 23:57:52 Having said that, one does have to wonder why the gas price in Calgary now is about the same as it is on Ontario, considering that theirs is made from more expensive imported oil, they have higher sales taxes, higher gas taxes, etc? Inquiring minds what to know.

3388 2018-04-28 23:56:27 4. Coconut oil is good for your skin
Coconut oil is often recommended, but for some skin types (especially acne prone) coconut oil can clog pore even more and create worse breakouts  

5. If it's cloudy you don't need sunscreen
Sunscreen can stop wrinkles, dark spots and damage

3417 2018-04-28 23:50:42 Put them in cold water for 10 minutes. Then dry well. Cover with as little oil as you can get away with, coat well with your hands. Put any spices now but NOT SALT. Then bake (temperature will depend on the size you cut them). Salt after they're done :)
3418 2018-04-28 23:50:36 Saying there’s no demand in Asia for BC oil because we ship most of it to California is *exactly* like saying foreign demand cannot drive up house prices because most of the houses are being sold to people who live here. 

It’s the same bloody argument.

3444 2018-04-28 23:44:43 Except it’s not because they don’t want the oil. Oil is booming elsewhere. Check texas , saudi, bahrain, etc. It’s because the prov ndp and fed libs have made it nearly impossible to do business in alberta. Very big difference.

3453 2018-04-28 23:42:55 How a 2000 year old book describes womens behavior today
:for the lips of a loose woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword

3454 2018-04-28 23:42:16 She learned from her mistake by claiming she didn’t remember writing those things? I don’t see that as learning. I see that as possibly a mental health problem or pathological lying.

3458 2018-04-28 23:41:20 Same looking at oil prices & how gone I think the US fed is if either china’s currency backed by gold becomes the standard for oil trade or the many possible bubbles regarding the fed like student loan or social security I have been in a sizeable long positon on gold for 2yrs.
3459 2018-04-28 23:41:05 Put Coconut oil in over night!
3460 2018-04-28 23:40:39 Aaaaaaaand another quack that doesn't know how work schedules in research and clinical medicine work.

3463 2018-04-28 23:40:16 I find what works best for me is straight up THC oil and straight uo CBD. Its still 1:1 but 1 ml up to 2ml at a times. Hemp CBD is shit. I gotta use Cannabis lol. What company are you througg?
3464 2018-04-28 23:40:16 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。

3467 2018-04-28 23:39:42 Alberta ff  economy is being abandoned by banks and larger oil companies.

HSBC just announced it's not funding anymore oilsands projects.

She'll & BP r pulling out.

It's time ppl recognize that GW has to be addressed. Some r.
3468 2018-04-28 23:39:17 The process is NOT well-known, it's never been done.  Right now we're burning ca. 100 million barrels of oil/liquids PER DAY (not including coal).  In 30 years that's probably going to double.  

Do the math on a replacement production and distribution system.  Mind-boggling.
3469 2018-04-28 23:39:11 I like coconut oil for cooking, light and adds a sweetness. We use a lot of peppers and say making fajita style dinner, it really adds a light nice flavor to things.
3470 2018-04-28 23:39:03 You like oil based better than water? I have an oil I've been wanting to use but I love my water based so much I can't stray
3471 2018-04-28 23:39:00 1st tri and filing season is like oil and water
3472 2018-04-28 23:38:49 Oil pulling works amazing too. Leave coconut oil in your mouth for 20 minutes
3473 2018-04-28 23:38:41 Do you remember your Econ 101 classes? How oil is a fungible commodity, the price is basically the same across the global market except for transportation and quality discounts? Stop repeating the nonsense about an Asian premium. And why don't you like California?
3474 2018-04-28 23:38:37 I'm in Paris (Canada) watching the 1st season of @GreysABC, slowly organizing my stuff for tomorrow's race.
Someone remind me to oil my chain when I'm reunited with my car.
3475 2018-04-28 23:38:24 TJs  old man promised non oil dependency from outside sorses. But later fell on a compromise. That compromise is still in place and should have been gone long ago. We sneeze to the petroleum industry chill. An now everyone wants a cut of the pie. Hurting the population.
3476 2018-04-28 23:38:23 Have you tried the 1:20 THC to hemp oil yet?
3477 2018-04-28 23:37:49 I have a spare oil heater somewhere but I don’t trust those boys not to burn theyselfs on it

3490 2018-04-28 23:36:07 Big Oil is a Big Bully... don't let them destroy the beautiful country we have... we don't want any greasy spills into our clean rivers, killing our wildlife and ruining our chances to spend quality time with fresh air and spiritual uplifting #cleanenergy

3493 2018-04-28 23:35:53  sorry dumbshit you cant have it both ways - YOU DONT CHERISH LIFE AS A NATION dont you get it - you fire missiles for oil , shoot schoolchildren for money and dont protect anyone

3511 2018-04-28 23:32:40 mane and tail always worked for me + massaging your scalp with coconut oil while upside down for a good 10-15 minutes(i know it sounds ridiculous) at night and the rinsing it the next morning too!
3512 2018-04-28 23:32:34 Yes... instead of listening to those offers... we get the best player in the  #NFLDraft 

Man we should have taken the snake oil sales offered to us, that way we could not have @saquon and perhaps the cure for cancer right?

Right.

3518 2018-04-28 23:31:57 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
3519 2018-04-28 23:31:46 Good old Greenpeace, thanks to this finding they will have to stop the oil drilling
3520 2018-04-28 23:31:43 But it's weird cause Castile oil is harsh too. I'm no scientist tho lol

3522 2018-04-28 23:31:37 I just bought another tea tree oil bottle knowing that it will still clear my skin
3523 2018-04-28 23:31:35 The government of Slovakia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Andy Samberg in a toile wig.
3524 2018-04-28 23:31:26 I am a Wen man. I love all the men products, especially the oil and çologne. I can't pick. All of them are great. I am allergic to many products but I have never had a problem with Wen. Still waiting on you to make a pumpkin çologne, wink wink. 
3525 2018-04-28 23:31:11 Wrong, it’s good for oil companies and commodity traders when prices are high. The economy does worse since so many industries, almost every sector and company out there spends on gasoline in some shape or form. Consumer prices rise also because delivery is more expensive
3526 2018-04-28 23:31:08 Oh shoot I need an oil change
3527 2018-04-28 23:30:36 Vitamin E oil helps prevent aging, reduces wrinkles and fine lines and help with dark spots and under-eye circles, all while hydrating and healing damaged skin!!!
3528 2018-04-28 23:30:36 I make a really nice salad with spring mix, orange sections, beet slices, walnuts, with a balsamic vinaigrette (really just extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar)
3529 2018-04-28 23:30:25 Thanks big rick
3530 2018-04-28 23:30:18 Snake oil
3531 2018-04-28 23:30:14 It is a compound found only in the marijuana plant. Hemp is a different plant altogether. Hemp does produce hemp oil by pressing the seeds. CDB oil is from the marijuana. And and and it is extremely effective for many deceases. Big pharma is the reason it’s outlawed
3532 2018-04-28 23:30:11 coconut oil fixes everything
3533 2018-04-28 23:29:53 KT tape is amazing. I would suggest considering shaving the area you want to tape first and having some oil on hand when you go to remove it. It can be quite painful and difficult to get off; the adhesive is strong. Definitely worth it, though!
3534 2018-04-28 23:29:42 That would be great-have a step-son that is 26 & is GENIUS level & doesn't know how to change a tire or oil in his car-still calls "daddy" when he gets a flat tire or wants his oil changed-can't stand on his two feet-I put a stop to that-kicked him out at 20 & lives with Grandma
3535 2018-04-28 23:29:29 Not much. Only in avocado oil mayo that I buy in the store.
3536 2018-04-28 23:29:18 To me, olive oil is essential.
3537 2018-04-28 23:29:12 Oil Country should be thrilled if they win any of the lottery draws!

3540 2018-04-28 23:28:59 Milo trying to get back into the public eye with the taped mouth nonsense is pretty amusing. I'm kinda surprised Alex and Paul let him off the leash to take part in something that doesn't involve shilling snake oil.
3541 2018-04-28 23:28:53 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
3542 2018-04-28 23:28:51 Y’all Mfs was FOOLING at the Oil Leakage last night...where were y’all friends?! 
3543 2018-04-28 23:28:46 I set a 20 minute timer. It helps my brain shut up and not worry about oversleeping or wasting too much time. CBD oil also helps.
3544 2018-04-28 23:28:45 Why is  NBC showing this idiot.on tv. Pushing his snake oil!!?? Dayummm!! Are u serious MSNBC??

3547 2018-04-28 23:27:47 The US is a bad actor in the world stage pretending not to be. Inside the US the pretense works abusing Americans Patriotism but outside the US, the Emperor wears no clothes. Iran calls the US 'the Great Satan' for a reason. America is a predator willing to murder Syria for oil.

3552 2018-04-28 23:27:09 Don't waste your money going to get an oil change. It's so easy and I love doing it, just buy the oil and filter and I'll do it for you, shiiii

3563 2018-04-28 23:25:42 Forgetting to have my oil changed really grinds my gears.
3564 2018-04-28 23:25:40 Remuve the subsidies to the richest oil companies. They don't pay any taxes.
3565 2018-04-28 23:25:30 Yes the oil is lovely too.... for night
3566 2018-04-28 23:25:30 zach...........

3572 2018-04-28 23:24:36 Lol.  I don’t need a dog nose and ears, but a litte smoothing out of the wrinkles and oil would be nice.  
3573 2018-04-28 23:24:28 I’ve never heard of this. I must investigate. Though we’ve cut out the “inappropriate butterings”: on fried eggs (using avocado oil instead), oatmeal (using nothing but cane sugar or honey because SERIOUSLY?!)... we’ll see how it goes. 
3574 2018-04-28 23:24:26 There’s already conflicts with our province (ab vs. Bc, ab vs. Que, ab vs. Ott) the trickle down effect pipeline access has effects everyone in the west. Rail access, dominated now by oil, cause no pipelines. Farmers can’t move grain, 1200 potash workers in sk laid off too.

3583 2018-04-28 23:23:24 maybe it’s just my skin, but i have generally have dry, clear skin, no way acne-prone! there’s tons of other oils and makeup remover balms so I would stay away from coconut oil, no matter what others say!
3584 2018-04-28 23:23:24 I don't have much to say here but the truth remains that PMB is better than GEJ.. Don't ague with me, tell urself the truth. Someone who sold oil for $150 per barrel and someone who is selling for $65 / 70 per barrel. are we expecting the same thing from them?
3585 2018-04-28 23:22:56 And gas prices are rising, have you noticed?  The  $5 a week tax break is going straight to the oil industry pockets. #MAGA
3586 2018-04-28 23:22:29 Nope
3587 2018-04-28 23:22:16 Who controls the #GPS satellites? The #Oil companies most likely.

2 separate GPS systems have taken me out the way for no reason this week.
3588 2018-04-28 23:22:15 general advice: i saw tons of posts reccomending coconut oil as a makeup remover because it melts it away and is simultanioudly great for the skin so I tried it. At first it was great, until a few weeks ago when I had a breakout with multiple blind pimples!:(

3592 2018-04-28 23:21:25 You definitely shouldn’t use “boiled” linseed oil, as it contains toxic hardening agents. As far as I know, hardware grade raw linseed oil should be OK, but always best to check the packaging etc.

3736 2018-04-28 22:57:01 #Big Oil is back to making billions#HERE WE GO AMERICAN PEOPLE,,, THIS WILL PROVE THAT BIG CORPORATIONS WILL BE GETTING LOTS OF MONEY FOR OIL AND WHAT DOES THE AMERICAN CITIZENS GET?? A BIG JUMP IN GASOLINE PRICES! SAY THAT YOU TRUMP AND THANK YOU REPUBLICANS 
3737 2018-04-28 22:56:45 Samrah You should try fish oil and gurh
3738 2018-04-28 22:56:41 Was gonna give myself an oil change and I realized I don’t have a fucking bucket to drain the oil into
3739 2018-04-28 22:56:18 Nothing like taking 6 showers in an attempt to wash off poison ivy oil only to have the hubby confirm it was a harmless weed.  .   But I’m beyond squeaky clean!
3740 2018-04-28 22:56:17 Excellent.  Well I am taking my Olbas oil soaked hankie and heading for bed. Enjoy!
3741 2018-04-28 22:56:16 I know how to change the oil in my car and I can throw around the phrase "catalytic converter" with some air of knowing what I'm talking about so basically I'm a car guy now
3742 2018-04-28 22:56:06 How can one person own an oil block in this country ?? Something God blessed us given to one person.. help me understand please

3744 2018-04-28 22:55:36 Absolutely. Clueless individual. This is not at all what is happening in alberta. Rest of the world is clamouring for oil and the demand grows all the time. We are hanging ourselves from our own branch, while the rest of the world laughs.
3745 2018-04-28 22:55:32 I am sure my dog is happy I am not at home for the draft lottery.  When Oil got McDavid I jumped out of my chair when we won...while he was on my lap.  Thankfully I caught him in mid air. #MakeItFive
3746 2018-04-28 22:55:08 He waters... the earth is satisfied...
He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate – bringing forth food from the earth:
wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts.

Psalm 104:13-15 NIV
3747 2018-04-28 22:54:32 How do you do your hot oil treatment? Do you just heat the oil and apply on hair ?
3748 2018-04-28 22:54:30 @KarrieFleetwood thanks for the support, hun 
3749 2018-04-28 22:54:26 extra-virgin olive oil. Sorry, but it's such a faff to type.
3750 2018-04-28 22:54:19 Find the nearest deliverance church and bring anointing oil
3751 2018-04-28 22:53:55 Olive oil, holy wata..
3752 2018-04-28 22:53:24 Economy is still growing 2.3 gdp that’s good, gas is going up because OPEC countries are cutting supply to record low numbers. The US is pumping more oil to keep prices low but OPEC is to blame
3753 2018-04-28 22:53:03 Oil slick shoes on me , so you could neva catch me slippin.
3754 2018-04-28 22:52:56 The world economy is tied to the Dollar (both ways). The Dollar is the Petro-Dollar. We stop using foreign oil they will lean away from the Dollar.
You went to skool, you should be able to figure it out from there.
3755 2018-04-28 22:52:53 Right how do u get Cdns to embrace it? Simple you create a financial crisis with debt drive out investment with carbon tax get gas at 2$/l then u lift restrictions on Saudi oil while destroying ur own energy sector. Saudi oil , Sharia & money is embraced

I wished the kurds to be FREE, but now they're reliant to the US. Kurds will have to pay that US invoice in triplicate, not only with oil.
And oil is by far not the only gain (geopolitical) 4 the US.
3758 2018-04-28 22:51:59 Cheers to the freaking weekend. Wow, first a scary oil refinery fire across the lake two days ago, then just an hour ago a fire in our apartment complex! My #PTSD is angry! Off to a mental health concert fundraiser next! First a stiff drink. #irony
3759 2018-04-28 22:51:38 @realDonaldTrump Why are gas prices going back up?  Don’t be like Bush! Republicans love that oil money #greedyba$tard$
3760 2018-04-28 22:51:34 @ra_oil 今日あたりちょっとお話できればな、って思ってます。昨日はちょっとバタバタしてしまって無理だったんですが。お互い時間が合えば、ですけどね

3762 2018-04-28 22:51:13 Are you sweaty or covered in oil?
3763 2018-04-28 22:51:08 Instead of an oil pipeline Canada should invest in a water pipeline for the almost 100 reserves without access to clean water
3764 2018-04-28 22:51:05 He needs oil for his theme park
3765 2018-04-28 22:50:43 Without doubt Russia's absolute absence in #Korea historic unfolding is momentous and directly linked to the moment it was made public a few months ago that Putin sells oil to Kim (at sea!) despite UN sanctions. Huge Russian brides population in #NorthKorea not a joke
3766 2018-04-28 22:50:18 It's almost worth the extra $15-$20 it costs to have someone else do your oil change. I think about this every time I'm midway through doing one, yet I end up doing it myself the next time anyways.
3767 2018-04-28 22:50:05 Yeah like “Hey native Americans you don’t have the same right Bismarck has in not wanting an oil pipeline running through your land” 
3768 2018-04-28 22:49:55 Who do you pay to provide power and what products do you buy that cause abject harm to the planet? Do you buy products containing palm oil? 
To change a corporation we have to change our consumption habits.  That affects supply and demand. It's up to us. Put simply.
3769 2018-04-28 22:49:46 Snake oil brings all the productivity hacks to the yard
3770 2018-04-28 22:49:40 aqueous cream!!! doubles as moisturiser and face/hand wash bc it’s so pure and doesn’t cause spots or excess oil, about £6 for a huge tub i believe
3771 2018-04-28 22:49:35 Pass!  I would rather dress in a white shirt and tie and craw under my car, change the oil, while it runs down the arms of my clean starched white shirt. But thanks!
3772 2018-04-28 22:49:29 I alternate nightly between .5mm and the following night with my frozen steel plate face roller. I find the cold reduces the redness from the night prior while also helping cell turnover. At first my skin was NOT having it but I use rosehip oil after every night after.
3773 2018-04-28 22:49:27 By stirring the wars in the middle east,the Rep's are driving up the price of American oil,so the American oil barons get more money,but soak the American people. Get hybrids/electric cars instead of being polluters. How's your weather there, eh? G.W.Bush smirked when twrs fell.
3774 2018-04-28 22:49:23 Ok.  Do you want to know the results of Oil Rumble?
3775 2018-04-28 22:49:13 Doesn't Canada have oil in the north?

3778 2018-04-28 22:47:55 That adds to my point, clubs like your lot can spend without the fear of transfers not working. You can just spend more next window. Chelas, Utd and Citeh have done it, not worked, ship him out. As I say, you’re lucky to get that oil money l. Acknowledge it and we can move on 
3779 2018-04-28 22:47:45 thank you! ive tried peppermint oil and it seemed to help a little bit i might have to get me some of that
3780 2018-04-28 22:47:43 It is happening with the oil sector now but due to the favorable business environment in the USA look for this to happen to other sectors.
3781 2018-04-28 22:47:42 You're completely correct Osteen is just another snake oil sales man
3782 2018-04-28 22:47:34 @potus do something about these oil prices!! You're getting into Bush JR prices this year!!
3783 2018-04-28 22:47:05 Is it because your oil is more refined or your BS factor is more acute? 
3784 2018-04-28 22:46:58 , glad I didn’t go to the oil spill
3785 2018-04-28 22:46:41 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

3788 2018-04-28 22:46:21 Awww thank you, thats very kind, but I'll find something I can buy here so I can get more after. Currently trying almond oil and not sure about that one yet...
3789 2018-04-28 22:46:07 Comparing a worldly country that’s acts politically to keep nations at peace to a private business that only sees a huge money making opportunity. #WWEGRR could’ve been in Australia, Europe, Africa, South America. But instead it went to the highest bidder, Saudi Oil Money. (Cont)
3790 2018-04-28 22:46:05 Yeah, I get there's a difference for what people wanted in Oil States, but otherwise the difference won't have many practical differences
3791 2018-04-28 22:46:03 @Emeka Gift thank you for this video on how the British govt perfected genocide in 1967 till date b/c of oil & gas#it's Biafra or we all die
3792 2018-04-28 22:45:58 I was going to say that any other oil/moisturiser etc would be fine  Thanks again, I really do appreciate your work and effort in these videos! 
3793 2018-04-28 22:45:50 lemme change this oil before it get dark

Tons of feed per year, that, if you’re lucky, your horse will eat willingly. Otherwise you have to search the different brands for what they will eat and won’t kill them. Hay: itchy, scratchy BS that I’m sure lies the halls of Hell, that could kill ‘em

3808 2018-04-28 22:42:08 Come to think of it, China are truly an ascendant Oreo flavour superpower. They've got a green tea ice-cream flavour Oreo that has mint oil in it to make your mouth feel cold.
3809 2018-04-28 22:42:02 I don’t believe he’s a spokesman for oil, more like a spokesman for the province. Most know in Alberta, that if oil suffers, the province suffers and It’s taken the ndp way too long to figure this out.

3812 2018-04-28 22:41:20 I was there. No forgetting that (even if some of it I can’t remember)

Here’s to the oil cans my friend.

3816 2018-04-28 22:40:51 New oil money. We educated them. They saw we were ripe for the taking in 40 short years. Many wars have ensued.. but it's all about power.. we know who has the upper hand on that.. I'm a follower of @simonharris and I don't agree with all.. but I'm  aware of power hungry people.
3817 2018-04-28 22:40:47 y el jean MOTOR OIL , yo tambien soy de esa época , la mejor época jaja
3818 2018-04-28 22:40:28 It’s still heavy oil filth.

3826 2018-04-28 22:39:16 I've got an oil. I need a leave in conditioner/ everyday moisturiser and a gel. Think I wanna try aunt jackies
3827 2018-04-28 22:39:05 no I'm sorry coffee mate creamer is super disgusting, it's like dunkin donuts flavor syrup diluted in pure vegetable oil
3828 2018-04-28 22:38:57 so..the verdict on the homemade coconut oil sugar scrub is a 10. It left my skin feeling super soft and smelling really good. It’s perfect.
3829 2018-04-28 22:38:55 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

3830 2018-04-28 22:38:40 You had already won the league before KDB came. You’re transfixed on transfers. For the third time I am on about your whole infrastructure. The financial aid you received massively, massively overhauled your club, from he bottom up. You were lucky to get oil backing money.
3831 2018-04-28 22:38:20 Been collecting oil from my face so I can rub "me" oil back into my face for an anti-inflammatory.
3832 2018-04-28 22:38:17 So Canada imports approximately 650000 barrels of oil a day. All comes by tanker. Why are there no protesters. The oil comes from countries with poor respect for basic human rights. Why not sell our oil and make money
3833 2018-04-28 22:38:08 So?  Expanding over the objections of at least some First Nations, while some First Nations support the jobs and income while some are so desperately poor they're throwing in with an oil company rather than our worthless federal government!
3834 2018-04-28 22:37:54 No longer able to provide adequate, politically motivated leaks, he leaks oil, causing no end of mess in the Embassy’s halls. Nevertheless, he seeks the truth about a ‘Rimmer’ in an effort to discover why this being has trashed his good name by labelling him ‘Captain Bog-bot’...

3837 2018-04-28 22:36:10 The Russian Govt contracts Mercenaries to overtake oil refineries in Syria. 
They got away with it this one time using plausible deniability.
But if they try it again it will be an act of War.

3843 2018-04-28 22:35:06 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President, the key to Iran is to broker a truce between the Shi-ites and Sunis. This is a civil war. We need to work with China and Russia to broker this peace. China buys alot of Iran's oil and Russia is a main ally of Iran. We can threaten to re-impose
3844 2018-04-28 22:34:44 It does.

3845 2018-04-28 22:34:28 I use this every day in the shower to comb out my hair. Add a little olive oil and curl enhancer or leave in once I’m out and my hair be amazing. Or use it for a over night deep condition and comb through it with a small tooth comb then cover with plastic = amazing

3848 2018-04-28 22:33:45 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
3849 2018-04-28 22:33:42 If a Middle East country (with oil resources) had a totalitarian government as corrupt as the UK, the US would have invaded and killed its leader. UK Tory government would join them. Time for serious thought about what 'terrorist' actually means. 'My enemy's enemy is my friend'.
3850 2018-04-28 22:33:33 Sell a bunch of oil on the global market, open some new hospitals and schools

3858 2018-04-28 22:31:52 I wouldn't but straight balsamic on garlic bread, it'd make the bread too soggy. Keep oil and vinegar for plain bread. Also very yummy.
3859 2018-04-28 22:31:47 No no no no no no.
Why do you want to import people whose values spit in the face of ours?
There are Muslim countries that could resettle the Rogingyas. And Saudi has oil money coming out of its ears. 
Why is it so difficult to get bleeding heart SJWs to THINK with moral clarity?
3860 2018-04-28 22:31:31 Depends on what you want, some got body oil, some are moisturizing, exfoliating, then there’s the dumb ones with glitter.

3863 2018-04-28 22:30:47 He has no choice. He has NO ideas, no platform, nothing to offer other than everything other than oil is bad. The man is devoid of any substance or character
3864 2018-04-28 22:30:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
3865 2018-04-28 22:29:44 My skin is dry too, but I have it covered now.
Double-cleanse to get make-up off, oil + dry face first, then a gentle foaming cleanser (I like the Cosrx Low PH cleanser). Avoid products with alcohol and high alkalinity, especially soaps.

3868 2018-04-28 22:28:59 I'm with you on the fresh basil but olive oil would be too greasy. How about a balsamic reduction?
3869 2018-04-28 22:27:59 Have you heard of networking Amy ??? Obviously not there are many possibilities out there maybe a new avenue for our oil & gas . Plus we need all the allies we can get. Try to stretch your mind Amy instead of stunting it.
3870 2018-04-28 22:27:49 And the best part is if something happens to the car they fix it for free!!! Northtown gives you free oil changes for life stuff like that adds up. You won't believe how many people lease cars. Esp those look luxury joints.
3871 2018-04-28 22:27:33 Top it all off with a basil leaf and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic

3874 2018-04-28 22:27:06 デメリットは確認が大変だった
3875 2018-04-28 22:27:04 Oil should be phased out altogether, the only ones keeping it around are the corporate czars making money from it and politicians who take their bribes.

3878 2018-04-28 22:25:11 #CadetBoneSpurs on Faux & Feinds said "There is no collusion with me and Russia and everyone knows it". Who's everyone. I don't know it & I don't believe it. What everyone does know is absolutely nothing out of this traitor's mouth is true. He's a snake oil salesman & we know it.
3879 2018-04-28 22:25:10 Look at them, they "sit and do nothing" expecting to benefit from oil money 
3880 2018-04-28 22:25:08 My Uber co-rider just jumped in with Mc Donald’s fries , and omg the smell.  I am dying! Why does it smell so good? No potatoes and no type oil has that smell! Wtf do they sprinkle on it?

3883 2018-04-28 22:24:15 Great song. Always reminds me of the Oil Wrestling scene in Stripes
3884 2018-04-28 22:23:47 Ever heard of networking Amy ??  Obviously not we need all the allies we can get & maybe a new avenue for our oil. Don’t stunt you thinking try real hard to look at the possibilities!!
3885 2018-04-28 22:23:17 Eleyin shovel hope you bought her oil oo,don't just love alone buy oil
3886 2018-04-28 22:23:12 For the #Mommytobe. Evening primrose oil softens you cervix.  It comes recommended by Dr and mid wives.  But you should be no less than 34 weeks before you start taking this....
3887 2018-04-28 22:22:17 Just changed my oil at Advanced Auto and ended up dumping $40 of brand new oil out on the fucking parking lot.
3888 2018-04-28 22:22:13 @wwe hope that oil money was worth it to side step the #womensrevolution. How bad did @VinceMcMahon need the fund for the #xfl?
3889 2018-04-28 22:21:48 We have 180 billion barrels of proven reserves of oil in this country, the 2nd most in the world.  This price is all because of government greed, and it is going to get worse (11 cents per litre) when the carbon tax is implemented.
3890 2018-04-28 22:21:46 Personally we should just twin the keystone. As soon as it’s out of the ground 75% of that oil goes to the US. It’s not going to China. We could be freezing in the cold, but that oil isn’t ours anymore. Ruining BC coast is not in BC interest.

3893 2018-04-28 22:21:22 Hydrogenated oil and bla bla. These guys are delirious already.
3894 2018-04-28 22:20:12 Neck oil, brain salve.
3895 2018-04-28 22:20:10 mixed more lavender oil, less sandalwood oil, argan oil from Trader Joes, sweet almond oil for a scalp and hair oil blend massage oil, it gives shine and strengthens hair, smells good
3896 2018-04-28 22:19:46 Coconut oil really is a life saver when you have a cold and the skin around your nose and lips is all dry
3897 2018-04-28 22:19:43 Russia was based in the city of Tartus, and attached to Khmeimim to guard 10.38 trillion m3 of gas in Syrian territorial waters. The outlaws of Wagner dreamed of carrying out the order of their masters in Russia to lay their hands on oil and gas wells east of the Euphrates

3911 2018-04-28 22:17:09 It's all about MONEY & OIL - MONEY & OIL - MONEY & OIL! The richest 1 percent can never get enough MONEY & OIL! It doesn't matter to them how many women & children they kill! It doesn't matter to them that they're killing the planet! It's all about MONEY & OIL!
3912 2018-04-28 22:17:04 The @NRA is not a business, such as oil & gas, that would benefit from such a meeting. From the email, it sounds like they were just going to use the convention as a meeting place. It’s squirrelly that this is coming out now w/gun control being such a big issue.
3913 2018-04-28 22:17:00 What’s so great about hummus?
It’s just bean dip with seasoning.

Mmm, garlic.
Pass the hummus please.

3922 2018-04-28 22:16:08 Roxanna Cawley has goats and runs Dale's Oil Company. Reuben describes her as not lovely. She feeds and takes care of them though and they grow to love her. Her grandfather has a theatre and her uncle knew Butch Cassidy.
3923 2018-04-28 22:15:59 Hydrogenated oils are when they blast an oil with hydrogen to solidify it. Aka trans fats, really unhealthy. Good on you @MelKiperESPN @espn
3924 2018-04-28 22:15:54 Do they really? Until OPEC they were pricetakers. They organized. OPEC is not effective now but it gave them some control while it lasted. The international and domestic politics of oil are full of intrigue but we must nevertheless demand our fair share of what is primarily ours.
3925 2018-04-28 22:15:51 Hot oil treatments guuurl!!

3927 2018-04-28 22:15:38 I honestly can’t disagree with your assessment of Lay’s. Their taste is almost purely salt and grease/oil, I think that’s what I like about them. Ruffles feel too opposite though. Like they don’t have the right crunch to them.
BONUS: Ms. Vickie’s are good.

3932 2018-04-28 22:14:55 Even “Olive Oil Mayonnaise” is made with Soybean Oil...they put a little olive oil in it so they can market it as such. 

Best to stay away from condiments all together (or make your own).

3934 2018-04-28 22:14:53 What's the point of owning olive oil if it's not extra virgin

3940 2018-04-28 22:14:02 I almost poured olive oil into my washer, so yes, I would say that the laundry being in my kitchen is weird sometimes.
3941 2018-04-28 22:14:01 I made a carrot salad w chickpeas, lentils, dried apricots and figs, an entire thing of dill, balsamic and red wine vin, olive oil, paprika, mustard seed, salt, and pepper, and put it over coconut rice, and it's danker than I expected.

3944 2018-04-28 22:13:17 Mine hit late last night, so I figured I'd take some medicine and slather on peppermint oil before bed. It was still there in the morning, but I made the mistake of waiting to take meds. By 4 I could actually stay out of bed but ugh I hate this

3950 2018-04-28 22:12:20 My state just recently made CBD oil legal. I'm interested in it but I want to know quality CBD from street vendor knock-offs. It will mainly be used for pain relief. What should I look out for and what questions should I ask? #CBD #cbdoil

That's what happens when all the oil rises to the surface of a water world  (maybe pumping was a good thing?).
3966 2018-04-28 22:10:02 According to @BlairKing_ca it does. Some of the oil is apparently for the Washington refineries, which will sell back to us in BC cheaper because of simple supply and demand I assume. True or not? Still looking for the facts...

Meadow saying it as it is.

Thanks to our leaders and their desire for oil money they sold out Europe to the Barcelona Agreement and chose to ruin our continent just to keep their big fat snouts in the trough.

We need a strong leadership not fudged rubbish

3980 2018-04-28 22:08:17 @RachelNotley @GlobalBC @jjhorgan How to end the oil crises QUICKLY.  It is actually quit simply - have the producers declare a ban on selling to BC.  We can only produce 25% of our gas but if there is no crude from the suppliers.,.....  Before this BC is destroyed we need to end
3981 2018-04-28 22:08:16 Sabotage of oil and lubrication will slow production or stop work entirely at strategic points in industrial processes.

4003 2018-04-28 22:05:02 It's good that they have taken feedback on diya into consideration, and not gone for the generic "oil lamp".

4010 2018-04-28 22:04:23 Environmental benefits of hemp McGill.  USA, Canada, China, etc could obtain most of electricity needs, other energy needs fuel from hemp.  Pollution from coal, oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  IMF Externalities:  Prices Do Not Capture All Costs
4011 2018-04-28 22:04:00 a steam of trucks on hyways is an evironmental nightmare of great magnitude no less than an endless line of steamers on the seas are getting it here. And that is happening now. You can more inordinate amounts of oil in lines with by comparision with less eco damage in the end.

4013 2018-04-28 22:03:57 @BuckSexton pointed out that the ME has diminished in value to the US, as it relates to oil. Not as much of it is moving thru the Gulf of Hormuz, as a % of US needs. US is an energy exporting nation. So the premise of the CFR piece is spot on: US Nat’l interests must be defined.
4014 2018-04-28 22:03:47 I thought it would be Fuzz, oil!
4015 2018-04-28 22:03:40 TFW you realize you're not blind you just had specs of oil all over your glasses from cooking a few hours ago

4017 2018-04-28 22:03:35 Road signs have no cost (it's a famous hoary myth that they do, a sort of bampot unionist version of zoomer nat theories about secret oil fields). Education is the main cost so you'll tend to see kids get educated where there are viable concentrations, like Glasgow.

4023 2018-04-28 22:01:49 In five years, China has upped its annual crude oil imports by an amount equal to total Canadian output. Who in their right mind would expect our small, 1950s pipe to be up to the task of serving this demand plus do all its other work? Hence TMX.

4029 2018-04-28 22:00:59 @jacquelineMjos In regards to your instastory babe - def would recommend bio oil or a vitamin e oil for scars! If they are super noticeable, see if your doctor will prescribe something!

4035 2018-04-28 21:59:45 700,000  barrels a day are imported into Eastern Canada because we could not get Trans Canada built to feed them western Canadian oil.  The risk to get that there through it's transportation cycle far outwieghts either  economic adavantages it;s eco footprint.

4037 2018-04-28 21:58:59 Much is fair in love or war, but killing your opponents in stealthy, demonic fashion, stabbing them in the back, particularly after making friends with them to obtain oil benefits, is not a strategy any decent person would follow.
4038 2018-04-28 21:58:44 good luck with that National the Party that killed rivers, promotes big oil and tried to mine National Parks
4039 2018-04-28 21:58:43 @jkenney why hasn't this government stopped the flow of oil to BC's refinery and turn that tap off from the pipeline that comes from the US and ties into the Kinder Morgan pipeline An also you haven't turn the tap off from northern BC. The Nat Gas pipeline that runs through AB
4040 2018-04-28 21:58:19 I would like to read that book. Is it available on Amazon? The thing about Nigeria is not giving history its rightful place. Try reading Oil, Politics and Violence and you keep wondering if the book was written in 2018.

4047 2018-04-28 21:57:28 The entire story about Saudi Arabia chasing marketshare is outdated because it only covered crude oil. The country cares more about the revenue than the market share right now, and refined products keeps them flexible to play the market however they like. More ref capacity now.

4058 2018-04-28 21:55:59 Yep, Everytime.  But absolutely big oil will suffer.  Renewable energy, creative tech that reduces environmental impact is big money, good jobs and tax revenue.
4059 2018-04-28 21:55:59 @RachelNotley  why hasn't this government stopped the of oil to BC's refinery and turn that tap off from the pipeline that comes from the US and ties into the Kinder Morgan pipeline An also you haven't turn the tap off from northern BC.

4060 2018-04-28 21:55:22 Seriously @MonroMB
I'm here for an oil change and inspection, but have been here since 3pm...y'all couldve at least told me it might be 3 hours...smh
4061 2018-04-28 21:55:20 Valve oil was so gross, but playing communal public school trumpets were the valves were stuck no matter what you did to them was probably worse! I don't own a trumpet because I just used the awful ones in my junior high and high school
4062 2018-04-28 21:55:00 The pipeline Expansion should have been done a long time ago, Canada with its massive oil and gas reserves SHOULD have been leading the world with its ethical  supply of fossil fuels, yet here we are over 1 Trillion in debt....just saying

4067 2018-04-28 21:54:49 Actually, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia do very well. Better than Russia. Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine all try for western-like reforms, but guess what? Russia has invaded all three countries and stole their lands. I wonder why? Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have oil. Nothing else.

4074 2018-04-28 21:53:46 Big mood. Also, I remember hating valve oil and it getting on everything and then I stopped playing for a few years. Now, when I want to start again the valves are all sticky and there is no oil to be found!
4075 2018-04-28 21:53:35 Good plan by Ballard. Build badass offensive and defensive lines. Then, some ball card hack like Conrad Brunner shits all over it and calls him a snake oil salesman. What a fuck that guy is.

4078 2018-04-28 21:53:32 Trump's economy worse than GW Bush/Cheney's. Both saved their own oil and gas and real estate businesses but no other sectors. Banks are a heart best away from closures. Watch and wait or veto Trump/Cheney out of office.

4106 2018-04-28 21:48:14 OK, maybe you misunderstood me. What I'm saying is, when I make my full plant cbd oil, and take the amount that has 50mg of CBD in it, I'll end up with maybe 10mg of CBD in my blood. You're saying that when you make yours you end up with 40-45mg. That's a huge difference
4107 2018-04-28 21:48:04 Feelings and thinking. Water and oil. What holds more substance? Your reasoning to your answer suggests a state of living or choice that best suits who? You of course lol, what if you tried it the other way around?
4108 2018-04-28 21:48:03 No. I don't care if she won the lottery and was offering me half. No way in hell will I get back with my ex wife.

4110 2018-04-28 21:48:00 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
4111 2018-04-28 21:47:23 So let me get this right: @PremierScottMoe doesn’t like carbon tax on Saskatchewan, going to court vs criticism of #bcpoli @jjhorgan for wanting to know if BC is allowed to manage oil flow through out land. Moe is a hypocrite. @PattyOLimerick
4112 2018-04-28 21:47:20 There's also the point that the more money you put into the oil fund the less money you have to spend elsewhere—so what are you proposing gets cut? Or would you—like Norway—opt for increased taxation and foreign borrowing?
4113 2018-04-28 21:47:19 Looked at a few houses, cut the dogs hairs, gave them baths, replaced the plug-in oil smell goodness in the house. #productiveaf
4114 2018-04-28 21:46:47 Fortunately for some clubs a new mentality can be purchased for the bargain price of a billion pounds of oil money though, eh?
4115 2018-04-28 21:46:36 He will be with his base. Lets bring back building the Model T. and use clean used oil. He can't stand being picked on so nope he will be with the Jobless  American Car Markers in MI. winning bigly
4116 2018-04-28 21:46:34 Chef Skinner cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with Play-Doh.
4117 2018-04-28 21:46:31 Why? There's not much revenue from oil taxation to make a significant fund, and—'second oil boom!' not withstanding—the best years of NS output (in terms of taxation revenue) are in the past.
4118 2018-04-28 21:46:29 @strangermiracle I've been using the DE TLC and Marula oil this week and my skin already looks better! It's crazy.
4119 2018-04-28 21:46:14 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but government benefits.

4124 2018-04-28 21:45:16 I recommend you using NATURAL stuff like aloe Vera plant , african black soap or dove bar soap as cleanser , tea tree toner or rose water toner , and RAW Shea butter or Jojoba oil as moisturizer !! Also water is really important as body cleanser !!! 
4125 2018-04-28 21:45:15 Gross. The oil tastes weird on the chips and the fake meat is chewy awful
4126 2018-04-28 21:45:09 I'm not a Real Man! Only cuz I checked the cars oil level. And it looked full.
4127 2018-04-28 21:44:51 Hey, but it’s not oil from Alberta and that is the only oil @jjhorgan, @gmbutts and Weaver oppose.
4128 2018-04-28 21:44:45 This oil had wanted to punch your observation near her minute.
4129 2018-04-28 21:44:35 I didn't want too dark a stain for this project so I added just a touch of iron acetate to the tea/turmeric/hibiscus. Next time, I'd skip the iron for this kind of light pine and simply add another coat of the tea mix. I'll share a final pix once I oil the board. Good times. 
4130 2018-04-28 21:44:34 Found out I'm allergic to bottle of oil
4131 2018-04-28 21:43:57 Y’all don’t understand the fun I had last night with all that ass, baby oil and whip cream  I’m about to lose it just thinking about it

4138 2018-04-28 21:43:23 Because they are rushing. Why? Because the system is overloaded. Why? Because oil cars are dominating the tracks. Why? Because we can't build a pipeline. Why? Because our federal and provincial government can't find their butts with both hands.
4139 2018-04-28 21:43:08 *Rocket chortles again, hardly able to believe she just drank motor oil.* Do you need a chaser with that, hun?
4140 2018-04-28 21:43:04 My clutch master cylinder just went out fifth gear has a problem where is grinding really bad doing around 50 mph and my brake booster went out also there is a leak in the radiator and it leaks oil

4142 2018-04-28 21:42:21 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4143 2018-04-28 21:42:20 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4144 2018-04-28 21:42:19 I think Venezuela's oil is not as superior. One has to spend more money to refined than others oil .

4147 2018-04-28 21:41:55 Hi everyone! Anyone going out tonight besides me and my group? It's been so long since I've been out dancing since I had had surgery. Which seems like a life time ago. Got my nails done, hair cut and oil changed lol strange combo. I'm going dancing and I'm going to have fun!
4148 2018-04-28 21:41:54 Well cause the drugs are in the oil that she massaged Willow with. It goes through the skin and I guess she doesnt wanna get it haha
4149 2018-04-28 21:41:43 That’s fucked up. I would’ve jumped outta the window a beat a hoe with a fry basket straight out of the hot oil  ya’ll would’ve had to come bail me out of prison 
4150 2018-04-28 21:41:42 Blush Double Dry Hopped, Hop Oil Infused, NE IPA by Hi-Wire Brewing found at Hi-Wire Brewing - South Slope. Get it, got it, good.
4151 2018-04-28 21:41:40 Now you have got the rant off your chest can you explain why you believe Prof Walter Willets @HarvardChanSPH is so wrong?  After all he has been largely effectively promoting the med diet (you know, the original, well tested, version with the carbs but without the coconut oil...)
4152 2018-04-28 21:41:36 Some argue Japan entered WW2 because they were nervous about access to oil and other resources not available on their islands. Hitler wanted land. Lots of war has been about land control. Now wars are often about water. See Golan Heights.
4153 2018-04-28 21:41:29 most infuriating thing is the likelihood that there’s not a single person in the huge NHS bureaucracy that thinks this is their responsibility.  Huge governmental organizations allow evil actions because every member just shrugs their shoulders and thinks it’s not their fault.
4154 2018-04-28 21:41:23 Saddam stopped selling Iraqi oil in $USD in 2001. Didn't take long for the US to invade to protect the global capitalist order. And who originally put Saddam in charge when he was willing to do business?
4155 2018-04-28 21:41:23 Had WM decided to keep all the NS oil and gas taxation revenue in an oil fund, while keeping personal and business taxes high (and borrowing heavily into the bargain) wouldn't you now be whining about WM keeping all the oil revenue in an oil fund?

4157 2018-04-28 21:40:57 Micellar water in a bowl then a glass of water with baby oil in. Squeeze all makeup off in micellar water then soak in the water and oil before drying
4158 2018-04-28 21:40:57 Imagine a Man City fan before the oil money
4159 2018-04-28 21:40:55 I just did.
4160 2018-04-28 21:40:50 my fav part about being in college is that ur told from like day 1 of school that when ur writing a paper u don't acknowledge that ur writing a paper but in college ur like "HELLO THIS PAPER IS ABOUT OIL. SECTION 1 IS OIL. SECTION 2 IS ANALYSIS. SECTION 3 IS MORE OIL"
4161 2018-04-28 21:40:48 ...the third clear case of US political terrorism after the assassinations of King Faisal, and General Murtala in the aftermath of the oil crisis.

4164 2018-04-28 21:40:25 Mass deforestation, Damming, oil spills, road heat. Smog. Ocean plastic pollution. Waste management. Radiated no go zones. Overfishing. Sea drying water management. That's before you even get to coal and oil use, which is what I think your suggesting about no evidence. Explain

4168 2018-04-28 21:40:11 When you come back to nz, land in what seems to be a paddock, and note how poor everyone looks, you realise that our MPs are delusional. Lead the world in reducing env impacts? Will a single major oil producer stop production? Yeh, right.

4174 2018-04-28 21:39:33 You're a snake oil salesman.
4175 2018-04-28 21:39:18 No, they chose to see NS oil and gas as a reliable and cheap source of power for UK consumers and businesses, particularly industry; they chose to lower taxes for individuals and businesses to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.

4177 2018-04-28 21:38:53 I think they'd be less war if the world economy didn't run on oil. If only it ran on ocean water.

4182 2018-04-28 21:38:12 さりげなく同人活動してる！
4183 2018-04-28 21:37:46 I think it would be good if the oil system gets crippled world wide.
4184 2018-04-28 21:37:42 Oh god  my mom told me a story from when I was little and I got scurvy from a hotel 6. 
It might be bed bugs, possible a spider? Usually spider bites get puffy and hard (and itchy)
4185 2018-04-28 21:37:34 Agreed. To be young again, haha.
4186 2018-04-28 21:37:25 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts avocado oil with 1 part lime juice and 1 part tomato paste. Add ginger and molasses to taste.
4187 2018-04-28 21:37:07 Ramen with an avocado oil vinaigrette just to add flavor. Only thing I'm cooking today period.
4188 2018-04-28 21:36:53 Trillions of dollars will be added to national debt via trillions of dollars in welfare to corporate welfare queens - Nestle, banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, Comcast, etc
4189 2018-04-28 21:36:43 Was expecting to spend like $50 to get my oil changed..  My dumbass thought the fuck wrong!
4190 2018-04-28 21:36:39 @jred5562 Hi, thank you for the film on renewable energy, it makes it very understandable.  You don't mention that end of oil, and how that will impact not only energy but our food system - another movie perhaps?  thanks again
4191 2018-04-28 21:36:35 Oby, ur oil will never run dry, enemy will never trace ur track, kip the gud work
4192 2018-04-28 21:36:34 @ThompsonKaydean I have a connect for you in Oil. W. Edmonds. Hmmmmmmm.  Hmmmmmmm. Global Business.
4193 2018-04-28 21:36:34 Took my car to the dealer for an oil change.. $400 later 
4194 2018-04-28 21:36:06 finally washing my car and tryi. to remove this oil stain in my seat 
4195 2018-04-28 21:35:45 If you like berries, you can make a fat bomb with berries, cream cheese and coconut oil in the middle instead of peanut butter
4196 2018-04-28 21:35:33 .@pmagn I saw a 'climate / oil discussion' you weighed in on and was really impressed at how much of a twat you are. (The word twat is widely used as a derogatory epithet, especially in British English, referring to a person considered obnoxious or stupid )
4197 2018-04-28 21:35:15 *Rocket snorts down a laugh, trying to stay serious.* Yeah. It’s in that big white bottle. I think there’s a whole quart of it there. *Pointing to the drawer with the motor oil.*
4198 2018-04-28 21:35:04 A soothing facial mask, vivid red, with cochineal, neem oil, and exfoliating diamond dust. It's sold as a clay wrapped in paper.
4199 2018-04-28 21:34:57 I burned those in a massive vat of oil so they haven't been available for a while
4200 2018-04-28 21:34:54 Lol it runs on the sale of oil ?
4201 2018-04-28 21:34:49 that shit was a bunch of oil . You don't know good seafood , absolutely no flavor, couldn't even taste the seasoning
4202 2018-04-28 21:34:48 Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever reach platinum level adulting... Where I wake up at 4 a.m. to exercise and make appts. for stuff like haircuts, nail fills and oil changes. Today however is not that day
4203 2018-04-28 21:34:43 Wow what sorcery is this oil mask thing
4204 2018-04-28 21:34:33 I usually steam them until the hearts are fork tender, cut them in half, then mix some dijon with olive oil, drizzle it over them, and let marinate for a few hours.  Then we grill them for about five minutes and serve with a mustard aioli (mustard, garlic, mayo).
4205 2018-04-28 21:34:02 Take a oil with you and test it.. show her and then say it may need a lot of coats and rubbing back.. tho I have done this before and you could sand the top layer off and expose the wood underneath and that should darken like walnut should.. think of of it like skin.
4206 2018-04-28 21:33:59 How much do y’all pay for an oil change ?!
4207 2018-04-28 21:33:39 Thank you so much for your kindness. I am very grateful for good people and good medicines such as is CBD oil. God bless you my friend
4208 2018-04-28 21:33:34 Curry is the best food, but it's even better with chili oil.
4209 2018-04-28 21:33:27 How much olive oil spills to the floor after ringing your hair out? #MobBossInterviewQuestions
4210 2018-04-28 21:33:24  is this supposed to hell control oil? If so I gotta get it too 
4211 2018-04-28 21:33:19 This is wrong, bad and good vagina’s should be working their problems out with warm oil and massage, not guns.
4212 2018-04-28 21:33:17 The answer is gearing. He is concern about his personal profits from our oil money
4213 2018-04-28 21:33:11 I really don’t care for my sisters 12 year old step daughter but today she looks at me and says “Kammy you’re really pretty” (I just put my face oil on) I said thank but not with this oil on my face. She said “that doesn’t matter, you’re still the prettiest girl I know”
4214 2018-04-28 21:33:10 Egusi 
Palm oil 
Pepper 
Crayfish

4215 2018-04-28 21:33:09 Yes
4216 2018-04-28 21:33:00 Ohh I see
Maybe try some oil masks?
I'm doing them and my hair's healthy af although I bleach it
4217 2018-04-28 21:32:50 Every person with a dietitian background I know does not eat vegan. They recommend a diet that includes everything in moderation. They tend to recommend lean means, veggies, fruits and nuts, with some oil and sweets.
4218 2018-04-28 21:32:35 3 showers & this blue oil pant
refuses to budge. It’s fine. I’m indigo, anyway.
4219 2018-04-28 21:32:31 Happy birthday anniversary ma'am @obyezeks  
May your head not lack oil, nor your garment be stained.
Continue to enjoy God's grace and glory.
Cheers ma'am
4220 2018-04-28 21:32:25 It is both possible and advisable to separate the art from the artist. If we don't, then we have to reject artists like Caravaggio (who created some of the loveliest oil paintings, but murdered a man) and Hemingway (who wrote incredible novels, but abandoned multiple wives).
4221 2018-04-28 21:32:12 يارب
4222 2018-04-28 21:31:53 And for oil skin ???
4223 2018-04-28 21:31:47 Following all of these patroits
4224 2018-04-28 21:31:41 Say oil again
4225 2018-04-28 21:31:18 Have to wonder, if given a chance to try CBD oil, how effective it would have been. Such a disgrace by the UK medical community & the UK courts as well as government.
4226 2018-04-28 21:31:08 I made a chocolate peanut butter one with coconut oil
4227 2018-04-28 21:31:02 Oil? That sounds yucky lol
4228 2018-04-28 21:30:56 Along with deep conditioning make sure you do a protein treatment at least once a month or every other month a good one is mixing mayo an egg and olive oil together. It smells bad but works really good

4232 2018-04-28 21:30:07 i go to change my oil and i have a stripped bolt this sucks
4233 2018-04-28 21:29:47 Dude 'u alarmist' now includes 10s of 1000s of scientists across all fields across all nations. 

Health, military religious business even oil gas corporations

You need to wake up.

Plant will survive. Not our society.
4234 2018-04-28 21:29:25 Trump is having his rich friends take over the US. He's selling public lands & oil rights to them. He's replacing education so his rich friends control schools. Ditto banks & transportation, as well as the VA. Stop watching FOX, read! We're becoming a Mafia State just like Russia
4235 2018-04-28 21:29:16 More oil spills more job cleaning oil spills.  Such a great idea
4236 2018-04-28 21:29:08 Dab some peppermint oil on your back, and lift your legs around his waist as he enters you.
4237 2018-04-28 21:29:01 We had these on offshore oil drilling rigs known as " lifeboats"
4238 2018-04-28 21:28:58 Years ago if someone was murdered 100 miles away, we never knew. We weren't any more or less safe, didn't worry. Maybe ignorance beneficial
4239 2018-04-28 21:28:54 I have chronic pain and a chronic illness that is slowly killing me but I will say three weeks ago I started my CBD oil in the morning and in the evening. It has provided another layer of helping and I'm so grateful for it
4240 2018-04-28 21:28:43 Can direct action and democratic process coexist? This wealthy oil baron says "no." 

More at 7.
4241 2018-04-28 21:27:53 Oil Barron says no
4242 2018-04-28 21:27:36 I live to watch Kenney whine and pearl clutch and feign outrage when people dare to question his big oil overlords. 

And don't bother trying to tell him about academic freedom. He's not interested in anything academic at all.
#gohome #neverucp
4243 2018-04-28 21:27:28 He is a free agent now, so maybe he's transitioned to being an oil analyst and this all works.
4244 2018-04-28 21:27:25 なるほどむずかしいですねえ
4245 2018-04-28 21:27:24 Dealership took longer to reset the oil change warning than it took for the oil change. I should have just looked it up online and done it myself. Gahhhhhhh mad fox.
4246 2018-04-28 21:27:23 Oil Barron is the littlest Trump
4247 2018-04-28 21:27:14 That's beautiful...you enjoy every moment with him.

4250 2018-04-28 21:26:22 So that's what knocked over my oil painting last night...
4251 2018-04-28 21:26:03 Aussie conditions, coconut/castor oil, and Cantu leave in conditioner.
4252 2018-04-28 21:26:00 threat intelligence is snake oil
4253 2018-04-28 21:25:58 The CNN that started from nothing and gained respect during the first Iraqi war is now 100% biased. Biased and reporting the news are like oil and water. As such, they are no longer a news network.
4254 2018-04-28 21:25:51 I think my home's tredition of oil wesling is pretty cool, but this obsession is a bit odd, i don't quite understand it.
4255 2018-04-28 21:25:36 i use mint/tea tree oil shampoo from cvs
4256 2018-04-28 21:25:35 I mix castor oil (Amazon) and coconut oil and olive oil (Big Lots) and vitamin e oil (Walmart) and my hair has grown so much since January, I’ve stopped doing it as much since i got my tattoo bc I didn’t wanna get the oil on it, but it helped w my splits and with length
4257 2018-04-28 21:25:14 olive oil works on removing tar from skin (feet after walking on a beach), perhaps it will also work on the shoes...but maybe ruin them:)
4258 2018-04-28 21:25:08 Olive oil Yum! Lol
4259 2018-04-28 21:24:58 in other circumstances, I may have some common ground with you, but keeping a brain dead child alive, just to tote around all the snake oil hospitals who are corrupt enough to extract their 30 pieces of silver is fucked up beyond belief!
4260 2018-04-28 21:24:49 Am I conservative? Yeahhhh Do I believe in guns? Yeahhhhh Am I logical? Yeahhhhh
4261 2018-04-28 21:24:48 Umm... I'm not sure Independence can change the geology of the North Sea; nor do I think it can summon up a time machine to go back and nationalize the oil companies and create an oil fund.
4262 2018-04-28 21:24:40 The Saudis are playing hard ball to crash the industry that has been plaguing their desires for 100$ a barrel oil so they are sand bagging the shipments......
4263 2018-04-28 21:24:17 Doing shoulders and back today pics later #OIL
4264 2018-04-28 21:24:11 This state is crawling with ticks. They’re here. Don’t go in nature ever.
*bathes in tea tree oil*
4265 2018-04-28 21:23:56 It's genuinely very good though. It's engineered oil I believe so fingerprints don't pass through unlike natural oils. It's not for worktops, just furniture. I've never tried Rubio which by the sounds of it is the bees knees.
4266 2018-04-28 21:23:53 Your old man in the WH subsidizes every large corporation under the sun from Oil and Gas, to mining and financial with taxpayers money! Why the double standard???
4267 2018-04-28 21:23:44 just gave my dog cannabis oil and she calmed down from her seizure so quickly
4268 2018-04-28 21:23:32 Mind, Cod Liver Oil is good for a knees up!
4269 2018-04-28 21:23:29 Well, it’s Popeye, and Olive Oil 
4270 2018-04-28 21:23:29 u r the worst that’s not how it works. i made u some oil blend to sniff but now i guess i won’t give it to u
4271 2018-04-28 21:23:15 But this natural oil I use will boost the growth, just have to stop forgetting to put it on w/ my busy a$$ 
4272 2018-04-28 21:22:58 I put my broken highlighter in coconut oil and baby oil so whenever I tshas with them I sparkle nyana.
4273 2018-04-28 21:22:51 After viewing a historical documentary where the Nazis were able to develop a way to produce synthetic oil from coal early on in Nazi Germany, my question is why haven't we done the same thing? We have tons of coal. Are we doing it today, and if not, why not?
4274 2018-04-28 21:22:34 They need some actually policies before the election though, and it’s hard to reconcile their stance on oil and gas, public transport etc with their rhetoric on the environment?
4275 2018-04-28 21:22:32 The only thing that sucks about being in an interracial relationship aside from old white people scowling at you is that my bf sprays his hair with oil before bed which makes my thin ass white girl hair extremely greasy every morning :-)

4277 2018-04-28 21:22:21 I want to drive my 240 to Norman tonight but I should probably change the oil first and I’m too lazy
4278 2018-04-28 21:21:32 He unscrewed my radiator cap and dumped out all the oil I'd just poured in there AND screwed everything back on. Shoutout to Mike, man. I really appreciated that.
4279 2018-04-28 21:21:16 I just use 3 in 1 oil and I dab it around with a toothpick.

4282 2018-04-28 21:20:38 Most "news" is crisis driven, always warning, alerting on something to BOLO, take a stand on,or beware of. Negativity is amplified greatly
4283 2018-04-28 21:20:20 I used cbd for a while but it stopped having much of an effect. But gonna do some coco oil mix and see if that helps.
I’m determined to have fewer headaches
4284 2018-04-28 21:20:19 As I tell people who try the coal argument- ‘you can green a grid but you can’t green oil’
4285 2018-04-28 21:20:15 Not sure what they did before, but I know they started rewarming limbs during the early 1800s after experience in battles with Napoleon.  Whether this was relearned or new knowledge, don't know.  Heard lavender oil works though.
4286 2018-04-28 21:20:11 Que usan a los pobres y nuestra guita, para bajar un mensaje político. No les importa el comedor, les chupa un huev0. Así como no les importó fundir todas las empresas dejando miles de trabajadores en la calle. La semana que viene quiebra Oil, más gente sin trabajo.
4287 2018-04-28 21:19:57 That’s all he’s been screaming about  in the campaign. “we should have kept the oil”!  Remember?
4288 2018-04-28 21:19:48 Took my car in at 7:30 to get an oil change. They just called me and said it’s done. Then they said we’ll see you around 5:30. Bitch if it’s done I’m coming to get it now.
4289 2018-04-28 21:19:36 I have combo skin and I’m honestly bias against coconut oil products, feel like it doesn’t penetrate.. but I totally agree with you.
4290 2018-04-28 21:19:18 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
4291 2018-04-28 21:19:17 I can’t keep up with your busy lifestyle. I thought you were still getting an oil change

4293 2018-04-28 21:18:57 witch hazel rose water tea tree oil and vitamin e oil and make sure ur moisturizing and drinking lots of water but this routine cleared tf out of my skin
4294 2018-04-28 21:18:45 It's an oil, so usual ways.... old pants 
4295 2018-04-28 21:18:28 Just as I thought today was going quite well... I spilt my Kiehl’s midnight recovery oil
4296 2018-04-28 21:18:13 Yeah, this is wrong on many levels. As someone who tries to live as green a life as possible, just the the thought of gun oil in my vagina is horrifying. Never mind an accidental discharge.
4297 2018-04-28 21:17:19 Really want to straighten my hair but also want to lather it up in some coconut oil... hmmm
4298 2018-04-28 21:17:19 Confirmed: @DamianDaniello did the BP oil spill
4299 2018-04-28 21:17:17 Who knew getting an oil change at this time would take an hour.
4300 2018-04-28 21:17:11 and never really fought to keep tech jobs here. Now, even the county would sell itself out to bring oil and gas drilling jobs and never even gives a glance at expanding green tech or wind...it is gas, gas, gas, and more gas.
4301 2018-04-28 21:17:08 Y’all really into guys that can’t change tires and oil huh?
4302 2018-04-28 21:17:07 You gotta wear Jezebel oil. It attracts wealthy suitors.
4303 2018-04-28 21:17:05 s/o to the guy who gave me some oil for my photo shoot
4304 2018-04-28 21:17:02 I put mint and tea tree oil in this bentonite clay mask and my face is THROBBING.
4305 2018-04-28 21:16:49 It depends.
4306 2018-04-28 21:16:48 You can try this out too:
Take fine chopped onions and green chillies, fry a bit in oil along with few mustards and mix with the floor. You get amazing taste!
4307 2018-04-28 21:16:46 Definitely doing the highlighter in baby oil Body Lava dupe with this Gold Deposit.
4308 2018-04-28 21:16:37 This isn't a question.
4309 2018-04-28 21:16:35 キッコーマンで。
4310 2018-04-28 21:16:34 Am I original?
4311 2018-04-28 21:16:32 That won't happen. They are both on  their last legs if it doesn't go well
4312 2018-04-28 21:16:24 now.......
4313 2018-04-28 21:16:23 Frustrating as fuck but this to me is a club on the upwards trajectory & that's  without the injection of oil or stolen money.
How far we can go with the current set up is a moot point.
4314 2018-04-28 21:16:11 The community here is small, the entire county has only 15000 people. so the loss of over 2500 tech jobs, most of which paid a decent middle class wage was devastating.

The state sold out to oil and gas drilling as it's done so many times before as a gap fill
4315 2018-04-28 21:16:09 振り付け力入ってて 尊いの、、
4316 2018-04-28 21:16:08 Takin my day off to get back to myself. Haircut, oil change, all of it.
4317 2018-04-28 21:16:08 We will expand, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

4319 2018-04-28 21:15:41 I’m so down. Gonna turn what I have into an oil and see if that works.
4320 2018-04-28 21:15:41 Currently hanging out in an auto shop while I get an oil change & my summer tires put on.

4327 2018-04-28 21:15:06 I would like to hear about a successful communist country where people is happy and freeChavez was just another clown from Cuba, his legacy now is poverty and hunger. Having the biggest oil and gas reservoir today is under the worst economic disaster after 20 years of “Socialism”

4333 2018-04-28 21:14:16 wow. no spot on the beach on Aruba?  This is over-capitalization of tourist dollars.  Jeeezz, gimmie the old days when the beaches were sparsely populated and there was no oil in the water.
4334 2018-04-28 21:14:03 I’m going to turn what I got from the dispensary into a coco oil blend. See if that helps. I tried CBd oils and they didn’t help for long. Curse my headaches
4335 2018-04-28 21:13:50 Shamra and I were out shopping, getting ready for our Honeymoon Vacation. I love the those Bloomin' Onions, so we popped in at Outback Steakhouse. I had a couple of those Foster's Oil Cans!!

4341 2018-04-28 21:13:25 Thieves! Oil is 65 dollars a barrel. At 150 dollars a barrel in 2008 it was 1.50 a litre. Government don't care. They collect GST off the top.The .U.S.price after exchange and volume adjust is1.19 a litre canadian. RIP OFF
4342 2018-04-28 21:13:23 Due to time restraints and unforeseen oil spills, heat 2 will conclude after 1 additional run.  Heats 3 and 4 will receive 2 afternoon competition runs only.  Pitt race Match Tour
4343 2018-04-28 21:13:07 it depends on how damaged your hair is, i’ve done it again after 2 days but just put a lot of oil in your hair (don’t wash it out) before you apply the bleach
4344 2018-04-28 21:12:50 International REFERENDUM solves this problem. People get to live the way they want. British and EU stealing of oil will not allow Peace to Prevail.

4347 2018-04-28 21:11:49 And you are probably scouting out projected oil well sites for your big oil friends who want to drop in them in there... how can you sell off our natural beauty like you do?
4348 2018-04-28 21:11:47 my car burns so much oil it smells like a two stroke
4349 2018-04-28 21:11:44 "oil rumble" lmao.

and yeah, the event ended up being nothing special. the only title that changed hands was the vacant one, and none of the matches were really anything to write about.
4350 2018-04-28 21:11:28 Literally why i hate getting my oil changed 
4351 2018-04-28 21:11:27 Our whole flat smells like olbus oil Jamie having man flu is an experience
4352 2018-04-28 21:11:11 This almost happened to me today, but my barber actually encouraged me to kick back and zone out a bit. Especially during the shampoo and oil.

4354 2018-04-28 21:11:02 Exactly right. Per capita standard of living have risen substantially. Even ppl on welfare totally have higher standards and live longer
4355 2018-04-28 21:11:02 You’ll also want to shut down all the ferries which have spilled more oil and caused more death than all the tanker traffic combined.

4358 2018-04-28 21:10:53 kinda glad that I didn't watch the Oil Rumble now, seeing as it was always super brazen Saudi propaganda
4359 2018-04-28 21:10:30 There is no different in what he says and call Nigeria youth lazy depending on oil money,where did power bike money gotten from,same oil, treatment also oil money,so who is now the lazy youth,I stand with Nigeria youth cos any condition they adapt,God bless d youth.
4360 2018-04-28 21:10:30 That is not the cause! Its caused by artisan refining of crude oil. And partly by the refinery. In addition to setting ablaze of tankers loaded with condescent (illegally refined diesel). It's really bad
4361 2018-04-28 21:10:27 Uhm, bro they're #entrepenuers who rack up inconceivable follower counts on the back of "Confucianism, but for Free Market" sort of snake oil. That's like the lifeblood of this place.

4368 2018-04-28 21:09:21 If it wasn't Saturday evening...

Could compare [joules served from a fuel pump per day * number of pumps] to [capacity of charging point * number of] at service stations to get an idea.

There's a reason we use oil fuel - it's high density energy - and the change won't be easy.

4392 2018-04-28 21:05:02 we use suppositories because they give you intake up to 70-75% , orally that number doesn't cross 25%. in both cases the same oil is used. What you're saying is that your product, passes through the liver and you have almost ~90% intake. That's amazing

4396 2018-04-28 21:03:45 Important to remember that dream placebo olive oil was REFINED - not extra virgin. This means no meaningful levels of anti-inflammatory polyphenols associated with health benefits in Mediterranean diet. Still leaves question of why it helped ...

4424 2018-04-28 20:58:23 My Outback loved leaking oil and local stealership are arseholes for warranty claims for said leaking oil.  4 door Jeeps are nice and with longer wheel base a better ride on the highway.  The new 2lt turbo should give not bad mileage.
4425 2018-04-28 20:58:21 Tonight we have wild mushroom ravioli sautéed with onions, garlic, white beans and basil in tomato sauce with a light spice finished with a ramp oil.

Or try grilled flank steak over garlic spinach and roasted fingerling potatoes topped with a jalapeño-lime crema.
4426 2018-04-28 20:58:09 I really need to oil my scalp cause my head is itching so crazy
4427 2018-04-28 20:58:05 A TASTY chkn & bcn recipe: white meat chkn strips pounded flat, then spread crm cheese (pln, or flavored), roll, wrap with bacon strips (use toothpicks to hold tog, line baking dish or pan (opt), lightly spray with cking oil and bake @350° for 20mins or until ckd thru
4428 2018-04-28 20:58:05 Excellent move by the Oil
4429 2018-04-28 20:57:35 make sure you’re using a non-pasteurized all natural oil or else it won’t really do anything except make it unnecessarily oily, also castor oil and shea butter works wonders
4430 2018-04-28 20:57:30 Add castor oil to your shampoo
4431 2018-04-28 20:57:16 If oil is abiotic and naturally replenishes itself and the idea of it being a scarce "fossil fuel" is false and is just to drive up demand and therefore prices then why do we fight so hard for it compared to other resources?
4432 2018-04-28 20:57:09 Even once we have competitive ev vehicles it's going to be a long long time before enough are adopted to affect oil consumption.
4433 2018-04-28 20:57:08 Yeah.

I mean, apart from some of the Sandopolis gimmicks and the fact that those green platforms can squish you, Oil Ocean is a little better.

And it's snazzy that you can go inside some of the submarines.
4434 2018-04-28 20:56:59 They also want Mid east oil. That is why America started the war in #Iraq in 2003, despite not finding WMDs that they claimed were there. #Imperialism #AmericanImperialism #Syria #Yemen #SaudiArabia #NoWar
4435 2018-04-28 20:56:41 Living in Montgomery Place in Saskatoon means waiting for trains often. I'm happy to wait today because it's a GRAIN train and not an oil train!
4436 2018-04-28 20:56:18 Mum used to put lavender oil next to my pillow when I was anxious as a kid. I still do it sometimes and it really relaxes and gives me good memories. 
4437 2018-04-28 20:55:57 Never buy for what theyre asking. Civics are amazing cars if you keep the oil changes on time
4438 2018-04-28 20:55:51 Oil consumption data. One can lecture Polman about his pessimism all one wants but should temper one’s optimism with reality.
4439 2018-04-28 20:55:48 Science put out by companies founded and run by owners of chemical & oil companies etc for the sole purpose of corporate fraud is not science. Skewing science for profit & zero responsibility for poisoning citizens is not science. Pretend 'alternative facts' are exactly that.
4440 2018-04-28 20:55:45 え、2周おじさんすごいw

4442 2018-04-28 20:55:19 Oooo never tried almond oil!
4443 2018-04-28 20:55:06 I like the Sonic Mania version of Oil Ocean Zone, the seventh Zone of the video game Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive.
4444 2018-04-28 20:55:03 Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for you and for your son. For thus says the LORD #God of #Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail.
4445 2018-04-28 20:54:52 Hands are now clean from the synthetic oil change complete by me 
I am good with my hands
4446 2018-04-28 20:54:49 tea tree oil does magic on my face, i love it
4447 2018-04-28 20:54:24 Olive oil mate
4448 2018-04-28 20:54:08 What’s the best solution to give that look of sweating during a live performance even though I don’t sweat a lot?  Spray bottles?  Baby oil?
4449 2018-04-28 20:54:00 your mcm dont know how to check his oil
4450 2018-04-28 20:53:57 So what besides MCT oil and ketones did they eat?
4451 2018-04-28 20:53:34 I was so excited to have this weekend off and then my tire pressure light turns, my oil light goes off for an oil change, and then on top of that I swerved in someone else’s lane to avoid a huge plank wood from hitting my car and avoided an accident
4452 2018-04-28 20:53:32 Did they ever calculate the GHG emissions from tankers burning their dirty barely regulated gas while  transporting their (also dirty) oil half way around the world?
4453 2018-04-28 20:53:17 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
4454 2018-04-28 20:53:14 Where there is gas there is oil.
4455 2018-04-28 20:53:05 A fair few Australian musicians would blink at that claim - not least Peter Garrett, who went from fronting Midnight Oil to serving an 11-year tenure as an MP with a handful of portfolios under Gillard and Rudd.
4456 2018-04-28 20:53:01 I put Rituals shower oil in my bath and my skin is so soft now 
4457 2018-04-28 20:52:57 Box of Queretaro, Mexico City
Yves Tanguy, André Masson
Pen and ballpoint pen, oil, and ballpoint pen on verso of wallpaper leaves
4458 2018-04-28 20:52:53 But not coconut  oil right?
4459 2018-04-28 20:52:52 Well, olive oil also not a bad choice for a roll. But disappointing when you're thinking honey!
4460 2018-04-28 20:52:32 Hair Tip: For one night out of the week, spend some time giving your curls some uninterrupted attention. Fully massaging your favorite oil and moisturizer into your strands by hand (no combs). #curllove #delux_hair

4462 2018-04-28 20:52:28 Wars for banks not oil then, huh?
4463 2018-04-28 20:52:05 Oil Ocean was annoying in Sonic 2, but I kinda like it in Mania.

I also like how funky the music is, and how hard the boss in Act 2 is (though it's fun to cheese it with Super Sonic).
4464 2018-04-28 20:51:52 @RosenforNevada@DeanHeller
Congress persons What say you?
Republicans can look forward to a win
Sanctions imposed.on North Korea brought Kim to negotiations
Sanctions work
Why aren't Russian espionage sanctions enforced?
Make oligarchs hit gold reserves
Enforce sanction Oil banks
4465 2018-04-28 20:51:49 But first I must rub the bosses hips with some body oil #wifechores
4466 2018-04-28 20:51:31 I work in energy industry my whole life. You are ill-informed about the oil&gas industry & economics as is @DavidSuzuki. You might want to look into who is funding his foundation & his motives $$$. You would be shocked. We all want whats best for our children. A healthy #Economy
4467 2018-04-28 20:51:30 Nothin like shooting the shit with a good ok boy. Talkin cars and racing while I'm gettin bossed around to check the oil on his daughters car 
4468 2018-04-28 20:51:18 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
4469 2018-04-28 20:51:11 i just made cheesy scrambled eggs with olive oil sautéed bell peppers
4470 2018-04-28 20:51:07 You have to keep up the fight. If you quit, then polluters and big oil like #KinderMorgan win. We cannot allow the coast to be destropyed or tarnished by dirty oil. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet #NoPipelines #JustinCrudeau #CPCBigots
4471 2018-04-28 20:50:54 And their fries are really crisp and dipped in vegetable oil
4472 2018-04-28 20:50:48 Ok question we went to this really nice restaurant to get burgers and the waiter asked us if we wanted oil on our burgers. When did this become a thing it sounds gross
4473 2018-04-28 20:50:35 ...And it just squirted all over the place. Got on my hands, saturated my roll...

Turns out my mother was using an old honey bottle to keep olive oil in, as she’s been adding it to some drinks in the morning and it was perfect for her.
4474 2018-04-28 20:50:17 Well that was an interesting day! Blowups galore, oil spills all round, not least at Lodge and the start/finish straight, a few spills, one quite significant on in the run into Shell, hopefully not as bad as first thought - all this resulting in a loss of nearly ninety minutes.
4475 2018-04-28 20:50:11 Wow I love getting burned with hot oil 
4476 2018-04-28 20:50:04 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
4477 2018-04-28 20:49:52 I didn't want to say it but this is exactly what I was thinking when I realized Oil Ocean was in Mania XD just "why" XD
4478 2018-04-28 20:49:46 Ni la jadinya bila dah biasa tidur lambat... lavender oil pun tak jalan
4479 2018-04-28 20:49:22 Did she drain the old oil?
4480 2018-04-28 20:49:20 Lol I gotta do an oil change as well so don’t wanna chance it 
4481 2018-04-28 20:49:09 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
4482 2018-04-28 20:49:06 I love almond oil and aloe vera. + vitamin c serums.
4483 2018-04-28 20:49:02 पहले Indian Oil बेचा 
फिर Air India को बेचा, 
Railway station को भी लटका दिया,
Defence Sector भी सिर्फ दिखवे का 100% FDI 

अब बारी आई है एक था "लाल किला"

फिर बारी आएगी गाँव, शहर, प्रदेश, फिर पूरे देश को बेच देगी ये सरकार 

बचेगी सिर्फ ग़ुलामी ।
4484 2018-04-28 20:48:36 I read Howard Hughes biography years ago. Their oil drill bit cost £100000 in 1910. Ish.
4485 2018-04-28 20:48:34 And he poured upon it a libation. Water or wine. And the reason is that he washed it, and afterward he soaked it in oil. In Beit El Jacob fulfilled his vow and gave a tenth of his wealth to honor God so that a person living in that generation could see fit to learn a lesson #God
4486 2018-04-28 20:48:22 Congress & indians r responsible who used to give votes for free 1kg rice ,oil ,blanket ... #have seen old days when voters r dumped in trucks
4487 2018-04-28 20:48:02 No to the damage by oil/gas!
4488 2018-04-28 20:47:51 Nothing SHADY going on here! 

Hive Games seems disturbing?! 

Good ole Oil and gas!
4489 2018-04-28 20:47:45 Thanks Brett for defending the province and our oil industry. It seems to me a lot of people who have had similar success would like to identify with the trendy celebrity left. No one should call you a hypocrite.
4490 2018-04-28 20:47:24 De dónde salen esos costos de la térmica a fuel oil? Pregunto
4491 2018-04-28 20:47:21 momma mckinley slathered me in coconut oil and sat me by the pool...happy to announce im eggshell white and no longer transparent
4492 2018-04-28 20:47:18 I really hate the sound of fake phone calls, which are especially common in radio ads for snake oil.
4493 2018-04-28 20:47:14 While still having the oil industry but slowly phasing them out. Would that not be a worthy venture? Or is the status quo of the same way we’ve done things for the past century good enough?
4494 2018-04-28 20:47:12 La Central Batlle andaba a fuel oil o sea petróleo y además de dejar negra la ropa colgada del barrio era más cara.
4495 2018-04-28 20:47:10 New tires 
New brakes 
New air filter
Oil changed
Clean car
Feels like I have a brand new car! Thanks to my little brother, super thankful I have someone in my family who can do the maintenance on my car and enjoy it! Love you @jesse_stadler
4496 2018-04-28 20:46:51 Coconut oil and Vaseline are my 2 favorites way to keep my skin soft and moisturize! Also when I have a natural look with no makeup on makes you glow 
4497 2018-04-28 20:46:47 Gee, I wonder why Shell would prefer a carbon tax paid by all, instead of a tax targeted at the people profiting from the activity government seeks to discourage?

We should nationalize our oil. We should extract it with ALL costs of doing so paid up front. Profits go to us.
4498 2018-04-28 20:46:44 we reject him, Arsenal pisses on PSG in every single away apart from oil money
4499 2018-04-28 20:46:43 I'm quite happy with my snake oil. Think I will order more in 2020!
4500 2018-04-28 20:46:33 No EVADIO, robo porque él era un agente de retención y debía pagarlo a la AFIP pero como Echegaray se lo permitía, el se lo quedaba todo era un complot entre Estado,AFIP y su empresa Oil
4501 2018-04-28 20:46:32 can liquids turn into gas in this engine? like if I teleported a really hot ball to the bottom of the oil pit would it start boiling and a gas bubble form and launch all the oil out?
4502 2018-04-28 20:45:53 AND THE PLAGUE VIRUS IS LEE TOXIN MADE FROM BURNT SUGAR
ASPHALT IS MADE FROM BURNT SUGAR TAR N OIL IS BURNT  SUGAR
DO THE MATH
4503 2018-04-28 20:45:50 My mother got me cbd oil to help w my anxiety but it makes my drinks taste like weed
4504 2018-04-28 20:45:44 When you suddenly realize that the pan you are cooking meat on isn't a  non stick pan so you low-key add oil to suffice.
4505 2018-04-28 20:45:29 *squirts pure chili oil into my mouth* Hi I'm Alice and this is Jackass
4506 2018-04-28 20:45:19 What if we matched the total gifts to the oil economy, to the solar or other green techs.  Imagine if we could lead the world in solar tech and have everyone buy from us that tech.
4507 2018-04-28 20:45:16 Price of Tapis oil rising in Asia 75.57 US Dollars a barrel on Friday 27 April . Expect this to be reflected in next two weeks at the petrol pump. 29 March price was 70.79 US Dollars a barrel. #tapis #oil more active and electric transport required!!
4508 2018-04-28 20:45:13 I need an oil change
4509 2018-04-28 20:45:04 Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,
4510 2018-04-28 20:44:59 Jake "the deflector" tapper. We know you're mad, but it was the ppl you pull for, that put you and your employer under the proverbial bus. Check the oil while you're down there, won't you?
4511 2018-04-28 20:44:50 @SimonMiller316 and @HammerSysum having an oil up and a pose-off... I have reached my peak. #NoRegrets #WeAreDefiant
4512 2018-04-28 20:44:48 Hurry in for our special Corncob Carla's Iced Road Soda Meat Pie! Coming in hot slick with Schlitz Artichoke Oil and beaten with the flavor stick! Rock on!
4513 2018-04-28 20:44:47 Hot water is better at stripping oil. Oil protects bacteria from soap.
4514 2018-04-28 20:44:41 Yes just Maduro. Sanctions are on persons not the country. Oil price is stil high.
4515 2018-04-28 20:44:40 Falta poco para estar en el quinto mes del año y yo ya me mande 293890 cagadas

4517 2018-04-28 20:44:15 It better not cut CO2, makes your job a whole more difficult. Besides they would still explore for oil and gas like they have done before with nuclear or without. The world need natgas, especially Germany in the future...I wonder why? Somebody has to meet that demand.
4518 2018-04-28 20:43:53 Superior's HUSKY Oil Refinery is shutdown, I think. I drove past there this morning; I drove to Nemadji Golf Course from East End neighborhood. I viewed mouth of Newton Creek. I saw evidence of oil & foam on surface of the water. It's on DNR list for chronic toxicity as a result.
4519 2018-04-28 20:43:41 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

4522 2018-04-28 20:43:22 Hence, its not just the oil.
4523 2018-04-28 20:43:14 If, like me you’re a worrier, you’re anxious or foggy headed; us no eucalyptus oil in the shower is THE BEST. So soothing and refreshing 
4524 2018-04-28 20:43:13 hey black people w natural hair how good is coconut oil for ur hair?
4525 2018-04-28 20:43:11 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
4526 2018-04-28 20:42:55 Gli spaccherei la faccia a uno a uno
Dopo oil 3-2 comunque
4527 2018-04-28 20:42:51 Killing us all over oil, keeping us from addressing the climate. It's overwhelmingly batshit to kill life on earth and break the food chain in a single lifetime. We gotta bring them down for the sake of all life - fast. 
4528 2018-04-28 20:42:43 You’re just super sexxxy perfect girl! The sexiest girl alive ....and ohhhhhh those curls make those curves worth kissing all over! Free hot oil massage for you! 
4529 2018-04-28 20:42:41 The bunch by Rain Oil in Gwarimpa won't take this downgrading please
4530 2018-04-28 20:42:26 Or rather, "Let's be okay with Stalin because when this all settles, he'll give Koch Inc. a practical monopoly on Soviet oil logistics." [Then we can use the legacy cash to back Trump & the Tea Party]

In a way, this whole toxic Russian situation has been ongoing for generations.
4531 2018-04-28 20:42:15 ooh that looks very good, excellent crust and good pocketed centre

9/10 would dip in oil again
4532 2018-04-28 20:42:11 Can't really say what he was thinking. What had always fascinated me are these parallels (along with spice being oil): Shaddom = Saddam
Arrakis = Iraq
And of course the dozens of Arabic words which make me wonder what his source was.
4533 2018-04-28 20:41:58 their oil works great too, couple drops under the tongue and you're in business. Really helped with my back spasms too, I couldn't believe it. Especially that I had been on opiates for ages prior to that and nothing ever really worked unless you want to zombie it all the way.
4534 2018-04-28 20:41:52 @pitbull can you send me an oil painting of yourself? Need it for the new apartment #dale
4535 2018-04-28 20:41:44 Oil is much easier to infuse but it’s worth the work for sure
4536 2018-04-28 20:41:24 You can use flower to make edibles too. You don’t need the oil
4537 2018-04-28 20:41:16 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
4538 2018-04-28 20:41:08 Si estan esperando que la Porota ponga la guita para salvarlo... no se olviden de algo...
Si la pone, se queda con Oil. Sería solo una inversión ..
4539 2018-04-28 20:40:40 It's the truth man. I could make some YouTube gold with all the tweakers doing stupid shit here. Watching some guy tweaked out of his mind yelling at a chevron sign in the middle of an oil field. It's comedy.

4545 2018-04-28 20:39:54 I literally wash my face with tone soap, and moisturize with a few drops of tea tree oil mixed with rosehip seed oil. For really bad spots I use benzoyl peroxide gel, helps bring oxygen to the spots to kill bacteria + dry them out
4546 2018-04-28 20:39:43 #Egusi soup. You need grinded melon(egusi), meat/stock fish/fresh fish, seasoning/salt,red oil and ugu leaf.
4547 2018-04-28 20:39:37 l'huile / oil
4548 2018-04-28 20:39:11 I use tea tree oil and it works pretty well
4549 2018-04-28 20:38:58 Chilli oil is a close 2nd but I can’t slap that all over my body & hair as well as cook with it  :)
4550 2018-04-28 20:38:55 Of course. We are a team 
4551 2018-04-28 20:38:48 Did you read, Hans? It said "sustainable biomass". Apart from that, it is not likely Akademik Lomonosov will reduce any local CO2 emissions. The planned fleet of floating NPPs is to power oil, gas and coal exploitation to into the 22nd century. You support that?
4552 2018-04-28 20:38:41 wow coconut oil is amazinggg

4555 2018-04-28 20:38:19 I am happy you said one of, and not the most heavily regulated. How many of the other heavily regulated industries have @jkenney spoke of? Zero. Electing Kenny is tantamount to electing a spokesperson for big oil. The Alberta government is going used as oil instrument.
4556 2018-04-28 20:38:16 The oil will run out.
4557 2018-04-28 20:38:12 homemade sugar scrub with coconut oil and brown sugar. that sounds perfect. 
4558 2018-04-28 20:38:07 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
4559 2018-04-28 20:38:06 I'm depending on Oil & Gas supplies which are at the same time contra-effective to to the climate by its pollution. At the same time I'm in for a better climate regulation by applying alternative energy like solar and wind.

4563 2018-04-28 20:37:30 Final: conservative "philosophy" is snake oil. It sounds good. But until our country can be honest about the power structure, and how it's maintained and for whose benefit, any type of equality or true freedom is impossible. The system is built to exploit and self-perpetuate.

4565 2018-04-28 20:37:23 My car died in the driveway :)
I’m thinking battery since it’s trying to turn over and really seems like it’s dying but the indicator light never came on?
Also I’ve never changed the oil bc I’m too lazy
4566 2018-04-28 20:37:20 I think CBD oil will work for uptight vaginas

4569 2018-04-28 20:37:19 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
4570 2018-04-28 20:37:07 @DeptofDefense Inviting Kim to the Olympic Games worked wonders.  How about loosening 2 sanctions on Russia and sharing some oil with China?  Making friends works wonders.
4571 2018-04-28 20:37:04 Don't think it's poor judgement. More like a delibrate dirty political moves for immediate and long term putrid benefits. Look at the dastard terrorist/jihadist they cavort with in Nigeria, for oil. The more things change, the more they remain the same.
4572 2018-04-28 20:36:46 Good shout, it’s dangerous though! Chilli oil is my favourite

4575 2018-04-28 20:36:22 Like it or not, the Canadian oil sands are now a target for the worldwide environmental movement. (See Chris Turner's "The Patch.") Pressure to act will increase as global warming continues. Saying "why should we do anything?" is, with all due respect, tone-deaf.
4576 2018-04-28 20:36:18 Based off oil income and a small population.
4577 2018-04-28 20:36:17 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
4578 2018-04-28 20:36:14 If you thought the far back part of the lot was slippery before,  a Miata has added about 4-5 quarts of oil to the corner for additional difficulty,  and left a trail of carnage into the finish line.   Second heat currently at a standstill for cleanup in Pittsburgh.
4579 2018-04-28 20:36:14 @DiamondandSilk  Two black women with a legitimate business opportunity brought before congress because they make money. Think about all of WH Book deals$$$ speeches for $$$ Gov family Oil co set up from stilling confiscated materials $$$. Jealousy!
4580 2018-04-28 20:35:59 Good points. They care about offshore oil drilling, but not the plastic bags that said oil is turned into. It's not like we expect voters to be consistent.

4584 2018-04-28 20:35:32 Poor Pruitt.  He is being attacked by the radical proponents of clean air & water.  That just makes oil & gasoline more expensive.  What's wrong with those people? We know human activity doesn't cause the problem.  God is doing it.  So it's Gods will.  Damn Democratic atheists.
4585 2018-04-28 20:35:24 They’re always upselling shit when you get an oil change 
4586 2018-04-28 20:35:17 The FDA has approved THC based medications. CBD oil is a promising therapy for Parkinson's. Most drugs we use today are synthesized from plants. Alcohol actively destroys your liver. Your comparison is poor and information about marijuana very limited.
4587 2018-04-28 20:35:09 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
4588 2018-04-28 20:35:08 Welp, the mower has an oil leak (as suspected) and will have to go in for service, but it started and ran, which was more than I was expecting.

4599 2018-04-28 20:34:21 If the US wants to invade a country, I can name a couple of candidates in Africa. There’s no oil in it for you though but maybe they could use their military might for something other than personal gain.
4600 2018-04-28 20:33:18 Periodically the windshield wipers on my car are changed and the oil is changed.  I've never done either of these things in my life, or even thought about them or discussed that perhaps they ought to be done.
4601 2018-04-28 20:33:08 I just want to lay in the sun & be rubbed in oil by my man, then finish the night off with some juicy crab for dinner, followed by my head in his lap .... but the way this work schedule set up though.

4619 2018-04-28 20:30:11 Send help please cuz I can't deal with my little nugget today she's OUT OF CONTROL. I need anointed oil for her.
4620 2018-04-28 20:29:58 There are people who get genuine benefit from CBD oil.  Are you including that under the general heading of "pot"?  These are people who don't smoke anything, who don't get high.
4621 2018-04-28 20:29:58 And if you haven't yet, you best see it soon, because Trump & the My Little Crony crew aim to sell off everything we have to oil and mining interests in cooperation with the new American Tsar, Putin as they build a Global Energy Oligarchy...
4622 2018-04-28 20:29:53 If we really can't do anything to stop global warming for a while, then we need to plan for mitigation and drastic GHG reductions. There are thousands of gas and oil wells leaking methane, and the industry is complaining about having to cap them properly.

4631 2018-04-28 20:29:09 If the #Pentagon can help dissolve the British colony in Africa called “Nigeria”, that would be a welcome development.
I hope that forms part of  @realDonaldTrump policy in Africa. Nigeria remains a haven for Islamic terrorists & their funding comes from the oil sales in N. Delta

4640 2018-04-28 20:27:30 So destroying ISIS, causing peace in the NK peninsula is bad? Tax cuts that lit a fire under the economy is bad? People keeping more of their own money is bad?

4651 2018-04-28 20:24:33 We think a short term correction in crude oil is likely. The market remains overbought and is approaching a strong resistance. Nevertheless, we are bullish in the medium/long term.
4652 2018-04-28 20:24:30 There is a surplus of light crude available, Saudi Arabia is having a fire sale, Shale Oil means that the USA and Canada need no imports of Oil. It's simply stupid to mine Bitumen and is only being done because the Oil Companies leases are expiring.

4700 2018-04-28 20:18:20 Your mixing up your Moore's. Littleswoods owner was John Moores, EVERTON chairman. Lol. Pumped fuck all into them either. 
£2billion in oil money has been pumped into Man City by a Country. Abu Dhabi own you.
4701 2018-04-28 20:17:48 ***Gets car back from collision shop***
***one day later oil change light turns on***
4702 2018-04-28 20:17:42 I’m afraid you may be right. World Water shortage. oil running out. Mass migration of millions. Mass starvation. All the money gone to the 5%. Middle East crisis. Manipulation of people. Big brother. It’s not good
4703 2018-04-28 20:17:28 "Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me. It shall be as excellent oil; let my head not refuse it." Ps. 141:5.
4704 2018-04-28 20:17:20 Why use tax evasion as an example to hide the fact that you needed aid, whilst being Africa’s top oil producer? You should be helping other countries with aid! Not getting it! Then it gets stolen at that.
4705 2018-04-28 20:17:10 EVERY question about CARCINOGENS IN AIR & WATER & THEIR AFFECT ON KIDS, AGED, SICK, asked by Legislators, EPA Scott Pruitt said, “I’ll have to get back to you”.  His audacity is glaring—20 in Security 24/7, $43,000 Phone Booth, $100,000 in Tax Payer Travel, Oil Lobbyist gifts
4706 2018-04-28 20:17:01 All the money in the oil not the tree. U ain’t hear that from me #NoRalo
4707 2018-04-28 20:16:49 Oh, you mean like how Trump did it on the poor American's dollar, while screwing around on the backs of the miners and oil workers and oh let's see, the migrant workers he's so against???

4709 2018-04-28 20:16:46 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for internalized misogyny, and put some sex essential oil in my diffuser.
4710 2018-04-28 20:16:44 ran out of oil. spring can come at any time 
4711 2018-04-28 20:16:31 “You can’t advocate against the use and expansion of fossil fuels because you use oil”. The worst argument ever.
4712 2018-04-28 20:16:28 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.
4713 2018-04-28 20:16:18 #ThoughtOfTheDay If olive oil is made of olives, what is baby oil made of?
4714 2018-04-28 20:15:21 @DietCoke  you make me fucking sick you sad sacks of shit. Take your oil elsewhere and cry

4720 2018-04-28 20:13:04 So why did the Nats not concentrate more on all of that AND the environment instead of leaving a tanking economy, broken Chch + transport +hospitals + MPI + DOC, power +housing crises, debt, fiscal holes, filthy lakes and rivers, oil spill risks fewer #mauidolphins etc etc
4721 2018-04-28 20:13:01 not oil
4722 2018-04-28 20:12:34 How come every time I go to get my oil changed, they insist that my car is hot garbage on wheels and refuse to service it bc it’s dangerous  #someonebuymeacar #itbelongsinthetrash
4723 2018-04-28 20:12:31 You hit nail on the head Roy! Every on ponders how stupid Canadian policy is regarding this. USA has killed a big oil competitor by makng us go after envirent issues like blinds!!
4724 2018-04-28 20:12:24 Must be mostly minimum wage earners cashing in on the spike in oil prices..
4725 2018-04-28 20:12:16 cbd oil tastes like lemongrass
4726 2018-04-28 20:12:15 Spilled tea tree oil in my room and now I can breathe too good. 
4727 2018-04-28 20:12:04 Every 2nd or 3rd day I’ll use the OleHenriksen Pore Balance Facial Sauna Scrub. And then spot treat acne w Melaleuca Oil from DoTerra!
4728 2018-04-28 20:11:55 Yes, a good place for chicken bully .@POTUS to run & get adulation, critically needed by #PIN_Head_POTUS (insecure child), from Trump snake- oil punch drunks! P.S. For some reason most Americans can't believe hyperbolic #ZERO_Credible_POTUS as #LyingPOTUS or #SpinnerPOTUS
4729 2018-04-28 20:11:47 You would think #HNR having a number of wells funded and having a top 3% find for the area and a higher oil price would protect against the funding 'hamster wheel'.

Explorer NPVs and timescales are super sketchy and dubious to me. e.g. #AST and #URU and #UKOG and #88e etc
4730 2018-04-28 20:11:45 my little green machine is looking so good today. full tank of gas, vacuumed out, washed, and got the oil changed 
4731 2018-04-28 20:11:40 Zo is burning that midnight oil...

4733 2018-04-28 20:11:30 Dry Body Oil w/SPF will be released very very soon! You ready?
4734 2018-04-28 20:11:12 Lads. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. I am gonna have to bail.
4735 2018-04-28 20:10:40 No, palm oil sucks
4736 2018-04-28 20:10:28 Our government only pay lip service to industrialization. It only comes up during recession or campaigns.
In their twisted minds since there's oil money why bother with industries. The falling exchange rate should have profited us if we were an industrialized nation.
4737 2018-04-28 20:10:20 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
4738 2018-04-28 20:10:20 The answer is to leave the Bitumen where it has always been. To get awful stuff that nobody wants, It takes 3 barrels of water to produce 1 barrel of bitumen. The land it's mined from is destroyed. Refining bitumen is whole orders more expensive than refining normal crude oil.
4739 2018-04-28 20:10:14 That's amazing, if true. "true" or true full spectrum has nothing to do with it, you're saying that your CBD is absorbed 4x more than any other full spectrum oil when eaten. I've never seen results like that, got any blood work to back it up?

4743 2018-04-28 20:09:29 i wish someone loved me enough to take my car to get an oil change & a wash since i work all day lollollol wishful thinking
4744 2018-04-28 20:09:29 black seed oil does wonders for some people and nothing for others, i think it depends on if your anxiety comes or is related to certain types of physical stuff. also goes by black cumin
4745 2018-04-28 20:09:28 FB appreciated 
4746 2018-04-28 20:09:19 Night: Kiehls Midnight Recovery Oil, Lush Tea Tree Water, Youth to the People Superfood Cream, and then an eye cream.

4749 2018-04-28 20:08:47 Well, changed the oil, filter, air filter and spark plug on my mower. It promptly threw a pulley.

4752 2018-04-28 20:08:14 Without an airbrush, what are your thoughts on which paint to use to colour faux fur? Any cons to using oil paint over acrylic? No matter how thinned I make acrylic it always makes the fur seem "crispy", whereas oil seemingly stays soft.
4753 2018-04-28 20:07:48 Does my sassiness upset you?

Why are you beset with gloom?

’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

Pumping in my living room.

फिर Air India को बेचा, 
Railway station को भी लटका दिया,

अब बारी आई है एक था "लाल किला"

फिर बारी आएगी गाँव, शहर, प्रदेश, फिर पूरे देश को बेच देगी ये सरकार 

बचेगी सिर्फ ग़ुलामी ।
4761 2018-04-28 20:06:52 This floating plant is *not* replacing coal, but the Bilibino nuclear plant. It in fact will power also coal mining and the fleet of floating NPPs planned in the Arctic is to power oil, gas and coal exploitation. Apart from the nuclear risk, this is a climate disaster.
4762 2018-04-28 20:06:52 I have a question for ya. Why was Saudi Arabia not put onto this list. They fund extremist across the world. Also 9/11 members were predominantly from SA. I'll tell u why because of OIL and FINANCIAL interests 
4763 2018-04-28 20:06:50 Seldom use in small doses results in greater creativity and energy. But yes, heavy use is bad for almost everyone. Restricts blood flow to the cortex (temporary “brain holes”), poor memory, less productivity, distortion of reality. Cbd oil is legal to drive on in 50 states.
4764 2018-04-28 20:06:45 How about the security implications of using vegetable oil to fuel your jet fighters FFS derp.

4769 2018-04-28 20:05:56 Between 2014 and 2016, Mark Carney and the BOC devalued our currency by 30%, in order to appease Canadian exporters! Furthermore, I was just in Edmonton, the oil companies main efficiency has been cutting labour costs significantly! So yes, the oil companies are doing well!
4770 2018-04-28 20:05:43 Is a driver in an oil company different from an uber or danfo driver? My sister your friend is just a repackaged olosho 
4771 2018-04-28 20:05:22 Oil prices are skyrocketing. In order to grow the regular joes need to spend money. When healthcare, gas and rent shoots up. That spending is no there.

4773 2018-04-28 20:05:05 *raise one hand, while putting the oil down
4774 2018-04-28 20:05:01 Oh god same! It was the worst, plus all the oil in the air ruined all of my pants. I have never felt more exploited and used and dirty than I felt working in fast food
4775 2018-04-28 20:04:58 @autozone thank u for always having great customer service my car would have probably exploded if sherry from the elkhart, indiana store on Main St didn’t show me how to add oil shout-out to her she’s my hero
4776 2018-04-28 20:04:50 I forgot I had a brand new quart of oil in the back of my car

4782 2018-04-28 20:03:34 Haha. I try not to buy products with shitty sustainability sourcing. My cat would be diving into the orangic, fair trade, non-palm oil, meat based equivalent. 
4783 2018-04-28 20:03:25  oil & cocoa butter lotion 
4784 2018-04-28 20:03:22 Save your money... just osmo quick dry satin matt and a lint free rag.... wait to dry and rub back.. one coat is all you need, too much oil and you may run the risk of damaging the adhesive that bonds the walnut to the sheet.. #bubble
4785 2018-04-28 20:02:37 Yeah plus it would mean the oil pump stops running so when you accelerate the engine has no oil on the top end which wears that stuff faster I would think
4786 2018-04-28 20:02:37 Oil of oregano is saving my life 
4787 2018-04-28 20:02:24 1. Olive Oil

New sharp blade on mower
Found the rake
Bought allergy medicine
4789 2018-04-28 20:02:17 But, the Trumpian Govt has so much more coal and oil to extract. That Solar stuff is just a hoax. #snark

4791 2018-04-28 20:01:48 Does this include sunflower  seed oil?

4799 2018-04-28 20:00:44 OK, well that's not as bad as true immortality, but it could be a deal breaker for me. I can imagine circumstance in which I'd like to die, but couldn't. Like being boiled in oil for a few decades. :-)
4800 2018-04-28 20:00:04 Now in 1859, way out in western Pennsylvania,
A man had built a rig that got some laughs from folks who came there.
But suddenly, a mighty roar came up from under the ground.
And soon a gusher, gushin' oil, soaked all who stood around.

4802 2018-04-28 19:59:30 My mom and I have severe muscle pain CBD oil and MJ work like magic on and have no side effects, it has been a life changer for us...Plus the anti-cancer benefits..
4803 2018-04-28 19:59:16 By "big oil" do you mean OPEC?  They are the reason oil prices are going up.  When oil prices go up, the price of the finished product goes up as well.  Since you get you gas from the States where the refineries are how can the prices have anything to do with KM or Alberta?
4804 2018-04-28 19:58:46 Lol nope... it's just an oil rig.... hanging out on the side of the road..
4805 2018-04-28 19:58:40 The only oil that anyone hates is the oil that washes up on shore, destroys the environment where we live and raise our families, risks the coast that provides food, and jobs. Expanding the TMX is about selling oil to Asia, not about domestic demand.
4806 2018-04-28 19:58:35 Pero Cárdenas, expropió maquinaria, instalaciones, edificios, refinerías, estaciones de distribución, embarcaciones, oleoductos y, cosas de ese tipo en general, todos los bienes muebles e inmuebles de empresas privadas como Standard Oil, Sinclair Oil y muchas otras... suena igual
4807 2018-04-28 19:58:24 Justice Alito has always struck me as the snake oil salesman of the SCOTUS justices.

Better at selling specious arguments than actually making ground breaking law.
4808 2018-04-28 19:58:09 Put the beans on fire, slice onions and let it get soft. When it's soft, add the Ata gungun, salt, Maggi and palm oil. Lobatan. Ounje ti de le.
4809 2018-04-28 19:57:59 @kissthegroundCA How the hell can you sell a tee shirt made with 50% polyester, a chemical made from petroleum (with toxic byproducts) by Big Oil??  You should be selling 100% *organic* cotton tee shirts.  @soilnotoil

And for $32.. Are you kidding?!

4816 2018-04-28 19:56:46 if you have olive oil it should be fine!
4817 2018-04-28 19:56:43 Did I tell you about the spreadable butter one? "I used less oil to cut down on the fat" - the two (2) ingredients were vegetable oil (20%) and butter (80%).

4822 2018-04-28 19:55:44 There is no shampoo specifically for white or black people's hair.  There are shampoos for oily, dry, curly, straight, frizzy hair.  If you want argan, coconut oil, or other moisturizing agents that do well on African American & other races hair, bring your own. It's expensive.
4823 2018-04-28 19:54:43 Not realy "for free". For military bases, and control over most of Syria's oil wells. Wait for the US companies to get "licenses" for exploitation.

4826 2018-04-28 19:53:37 1980-90s: Norway run by Corbyn style Socialists. 
9 of the 20 years between 1980 and 2000 was run by conservatives.
Corbyn policies would not work within the framework the oil fund operates.

4832 2018-04-28 19:52:47 The Iraq war came from silly neoconservative pseudo-intellectuals that had this idea that they were going to remake the Middle East from top to bottom to spread democracy.

To be clear I'm not defending them at all, but I actually don't think it was motivated to seize Iraq's oil.
4833 2018-04-28 19:52:46 Here comes the sad side show antics and vocal spew points for his rally tonight. Trump is nothing but a modern day snake oil salesman and a bad one at that...
4834 2018-04-28 19:52:43 Cool beans!!! I may just change the oil in the Gato-mobile and head up from San Antonio...
4835 2018-04-28 19:52:42 that is also a factor. but this is a problem across the globe according to this tread. for sure oil companies are doing well.

4840 2018-04-28 19:51:45 But you need a little snake oil to ease agile and scrum to an illogical inflexible business

No wait. That can't be. The US would have beaten you to the punch.
4847 2018-04-28 19:50:20 I'll be intellectually honest. As someone with rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, AND osteoarthritis, medical marijuana and especially CBD water and oil has kept my pain manageable and kept me working and OFF disability.

4862 2018-04-28 19:48:27 Fuel prices go up throughout North America at this time of year, they’re even complaining in Edmonton. With well over 50 cents a litre here going toward gas tax, you can see it has nothing to do with a pipeline and absolutely nothing to do with selling heavy oil to Asia.

4868 2018-04-28 19:47:34 @foxandfriends @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  What ever happened to Drill Baby Drill???  Why are gas prices so high if we have more oil than anybody on the planet?  How about cutting OUR oil companies down a peg?? MAKE A DEAL THEY CAN'T REFUSE for us  BOSS....errr Sir!

4874 2018-04-28 19:46:53 It is true that all the oil wealth in the Middle East is an aggravating factor thats contributed to the conflicts there.

But, IMO, what you're doing again is broadening the definition of resource war beyond the point of usefulness.

It wasn't a war to seize control of resources.
4875 2018-04-28 19:46:42 Got them both :)
4876 2018-04-28 19:46:36 I firmly believe there are some who are that psychopathic, they want people to get cancer, so they can manipulate them into believing their brand of snake oil has "cured" their victims.

4879 2018-04-28 19:46:10 I don’t like getting my oil changed because they ask if I want them to replace or do other things and I know it’s coming but it’s hard to say no
4880 2018-04-28 19:46:08 Sure did. If you want to sell snake oil, sell it to Americans.  Not only will they buy it all. They’ll pay twice the price.
4881 2018-04-28 19:45:57 Don’t buy products using palm oil. It’s an ecological disaster to support that market.
4882 2018-04-28 19:45:56 Just apply it on the areas waxed and where you usually break out! You can find that oil almost anywhere!
4883 2018-04-28 19:45:55 "suckle at the teat of the oil industry" is a phrase I'd never imagine reading and I'm SO glad I did
4884 2018-04-28 19:45:39 Just read in bio they can help people be 500% more effective. I'm pretty sure I've commented on same thing before. That's just not a thing that can be done.

And this person is apparently a high profile L&D person of some sort.

On a separate note, I'm selling snake oil tomorrow.
4885 2018-04-28 19:45:35 Olive oil is the best ingredient. Fight anyone who disagrees.
4886 2018-04-28 19:45:33 Driven by the snake oil people I suspect. The endless "alternative/natural medicine" products they have to sell need people to be sick. So they prey on the easily manipulated, deluded, ignorant and desperate.

4908 2018-04-28 19:42:37 Agree with you 1000000%. Social media has given a voice to the ignorant and hateful people that would’ve never voted otherwise. He advertised snake oil, Sat back and watched people spread it on SM.
4909 2018-04-28 19:42:36 Thanks for the 1st clip! Looking forward to the 2nd one already. Though not having oil readily available is a rookie mistake

4914 2018-04-28 19:42:06 But none of it would have happened unless 
1) control of oil resources leads to power on the world stage
2) this country is located in a major locus of control of that resource

Moral outrages all over the world, and worse terrorist threats. Why here? Seems to me it's resources.
4915 2018-04-28 19:42:04 Rick is showing people how to cook the oil at home, ofc there are numerous ways in which it can be improved, just not in every household

4922 2018-04-28 19:40:55 By the way, I'd add that you could argue that very recently, resource wars have been rising again:

The conflict over control of the South China Sea is motivated in part by desire to control all the oil & gas under it. And in the Congo, the blood diamond business continues.

Does water come up from a well and connects to your home's plumbing system solely by the force of nature.
Does oil come free? Iron? Copper?

4944 2018-04-28 19:39:06 Why would @realDonaldTrump @EPA & @GOP freeze fuel economy standards? Higher gas mileage saves oil AND saves people money filling up their vehicles, possibly more that “tax cut” did. Isn’t our goal to be energy independent or is the real goal to make us oil dependent?
4945 2018-04-28 19:39:04 Guy, Sope dipped his forehead in vegetable oil 
4946 2018-04-28 19:38:55 Ever wonder why their oil might be cheaper? Could it be they do not have to live up to the same environmental, labor standards that the companies here do?
4947 2018-04-28 19:38:49 Oil change & inspection time. If new wipers is all they saw today, I’m good. Otherwise, the “come out here so we can point out how your engine block needs to be rotated” speech is lame.
4948 2018-04-28 19:38:46 Nope. Oil companies are now paying tax. You realise that north sea exploration would have required investment then? If it didn't work out we would be left with the bill. This way oil companies shared the risk

4959 2018-04-28 19:37:53 Even more importantly, AB could be selling Canadian oil to Canada rather than shipping it to the US at a huge discount. What the insane activists fail to realize is that oil WILL be produced, sold, and consumed - regardless of Country of origin. Canada is losing billions.
4960 2018-04-28 19:37:37 Who is Andrew Leach? Is he a neutral 3rd party without bias? Does he have an axe to grind with Suzuki? David has been pretty hard on oil proponents, economists, and corporate / university leadership particularly in Alberta. If he is free from bias in this talk, sound good.

4974 2018-04-28 19:34:37 His thesis is based on the assumption that those with cars will give them up and those that want cars will stop wanting cars. Americans are actually buying bigger vehicles today trucks SUVs etc than they were when oil was $25 a barrel. More cars are sold than less.
4975 2018-04-28 19:34:35 In Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, oil is cheaper than water
4976 2018-04-28 19:34:30 I’m out of black seed oil. Can I substitute turmeric until I can get more? They do the same thing, right??? #FitnessTwitter

4980 2018-04-28 19:33:49 If you take in, 1. Low range. 2. No plan past Smolensk (no, really), 3. Hitler knew it was the oil stupid, but high command ignored him and planned for taking cities anyway (halo Halder!). I'm amazed they lasted as long as they did.
I mean...
4981 2018-04-28 19:33:48 No it certainly wouldn't hurt to try RSO.
 (but I did read a letter to Mr Simpson from a neurologist in Holland saying that his oil, although very good, could be better isvhe just slightly changed his extraction method.  I'll try to find that n send you details....)

4989 2018-04-28 19:32:07 Natural gas/oil production on PRIVATE land increased IN-SPITE of obama denying access to government lands...again effects tons of energy jobs AND all the support services like bakeries and dry cleaners and hardware store and our UTILITY PRICES AT HOME..
Gah. So many bad policies

4991 2018-04-28 19:32:02 Miracle Whip actually isn’t mayonnaise. It’s salad dressing made from mostly soybean oil, vinegar, eggs, mustard flower, paprika, and garlic.
4992 2018-04-28 19:31:37 JT tied with Bezos of Amazon. That guy whose workers have to attend food banks to eat b/c he doesn't pay adequately. Rest is so bogus b/c we know differently the real lack of leadership on local rights and UNDRIP avoidance from our oil czar.

5005 2018-04-28 19:29:53 Wrote about it last week. It’s the most visible and recurring of all household budget items. Will hit confidence and spending if oil stays where it is.

5018 2018-04-28 19:26:44 My parents made me learn how to change a tire, change my oil, and do basic car maintenance before they allowed me to get my license and a car. So when I say I don’t need you I literally mean it 
5019 2018-04-28 19:26:38 That was the first thing they were planning. Cannabis oil THC stops all seizures unlike the drugs on the NHS. In Italy they don’t criminalise it. Then the operation to stop seizures. But Alfie sadly died this morning at 2:30am. NHS done it’s job as intended.

5023 2018-04-28 19:26:06 Syria has a much larger surface area than Israel, it has a Med coast, and it has oil.

But it is a shithole like Gaza. What are the common denominators?

5030 2018-04-28 19:24:52 We need an administration that prizes renewable energy and efficiency incentives rather than pushing coal and oil. It's no longer 1900.
5031 2018-04-28 19:24:41 well honey I certainly do need them. Keep it up  and keep it coming!!

5040 2018-04-28 19:23:09 I’ve had photo printed cake (ate a bit of my mum, felt very wrong), and there are colourful icing things all over. Not the same as a thick oil painting somehow.
5041 2018-04-28 19:22:54 Lockheed Martin spends millions each year lobbying the US congress to oil the military machine with more funding.
5042 2018-04-28 19:21:43 Trump takes credit for anything he feels benefits him. Anything negative will be aggressively denied. He is a snake oil salesman that can’t peddle any products.

5047 2018-04-28 19:21:18 @pulpmx @PulpmxShow Which series is a better pay day MXGP or Lucas Oil Motocross ? 
Why wouldn't MXGP Redbull KTM release a rider to their US team for 2018 Lucas Oil Motocross? 
I believe Redbull KTM has a 3 rider MXGP field? So i'de think they could spare a rider no ?
5048 2018-04-28 19:21:15 Yes but just because they work in the oil chaging lot doesnt mean they will work out on the road. This is a proven fact! 
5049 2018-04-28 19:21:10 As do I, apart from what I grow myself. I’m still eating potatoes and beetroot from last year along with preserved tomatoes, green beans in Provençal sauce, raspberries, stewed apples and herbs blitzed with oil to snap off and put in cooking.
5050 2018-04-28 19:21:05 okay well you and aj can get together and change my oil next time. 
5051 2018-04-28 19:21:04 No correction chad, some jackass oil tech cranked the filter on too tight and i couldn't get it off with my adjustable filter wrench. I told her next time she had Grampy pay to get it changed to ask the guys what the specific size was. Didn't want to strip your filter threads

5053 2018-04-28 19:20:16 i’m in Autozone and this old man comes up to me asking about what oil he should buy .. i’m like sir, I have no clue. I don’t know why they even sent me. He talkin bout some “I know you don’t. I just wanted to tell you you got my eyes poppin and mouth droppin” 
5054 2018-04-28 19:19:41 The tool to get your oil filter out? You can rent them from Advance. Fools.

5063 2018-04-28 19:18:31 Finite natural resource are a unique circumstance.  

Every other major oil exporting nation on earth has nationalized the industry to some extent.
5064 2018-04-28 19:18:30 @MotoJonesy won’t change my oil because he doesn’t have the thingy to take the thingy out
5065 2018-04-28 19:18:29 LOL.  The whole cult is based on vaporware sold by a snake oil salesman to a bunch of clueless dipshits.
5066 2018-04-28 19:18:00 Productive Saturday .. cleaned  laundry  oil change  gym  & now going back home to shower, make a grilled chicken salad, Netflix and Chill by myself 
5067 2018-04-28 19:17:59 One can fit about three full broken down AR style weapons in a 4 inch wide 4 foot long pvc pipe filled with oil.  One only has to bury them off their property for a decent amount of time.

Good luck with you fantasy,  asshole.
5068 2018-04-28 19:17:51 Funny how people can flex their cars but can’t do an oil change 
5069 2018-04-28 19:17:43 I'd end up using that for painting and oil paint when I made and decorated a cake.
5070 2018-04-28 19:17:41 True...but what has sgr achieved with no linkage to Uganda.... jubilee is just using projects to swidle public cash..if she had reached turkana we'd b exp oil now
5071 2018-04-28 19:17:14 Lmao I feel bad for anyone that actually pays to have their oil changed.

5073 2018-04-28 19:16:37 US going back in Iran deal solely because trump wants to. Why? His friends in Russia rely on a high oil price. Iranian oil ruins this
5074 2018-04-28 19:16:35 LMAO--well that's some drift, Doc, haha. I know you struggle to keep up, but your practice of helping the rural people in your area? It's a God send for sure. Hope you know you are in our hearts and prayers. Angels on earth do exist.

5076 2018-04-28 19:16:07 So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for –, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
5077 2018-04-28 19:16:03 @NTB At which point he said 'we checked and your tires didn't need rotated', and said something about corporate policy states tires with most tread have to stay at the back. The tech wasn't honest. I'm very worried. Were my tires were rotated the past 3 oil changes with NTB?
5078 2018-04-28 19:15:55 You like it ? I loveeee peppermint oil that’s good too

5082 2018-04-28 19:15:35 No they're oil based
5083 2018-04-28 19:15:15 @NTB Very disappointed in NTB in Monaca PA. Tire rotation is supposed to be included with oil change. I had marked the front right tire with black marker. After I paid, I noticed the same tire was still on the front right wheel.
5084 2018-04-28 19:15:13 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
5085 2018-04-28 19:15:13 That would just introduce an additional arbitrage opportunity into the global oil market, and bump Canadian petroleum prices slightly. I'm all for measures that improve human rights in those countries, but this idea isn't sound.
5086 2018-04-28 19:14:54 i use coconut oil religiously
5087 2018-04-28 19:14:50 I just got an oil change last month. But, I’m currently 971 miles over from the time which I was to get my truck serviced again. And, I’m not scheduled to return until August.
5088 2018-04-28 19:14:41 Besides their preference for plutocratic forms of government, the main source of revenue for the Kochs comes from their petrochemical industries, which means they share Putins determination to maintain oil dependence and fight to suppress renewable energy-Koch states penalize it
5089 2018-04-28 19:14:41 I use it about every other month.. I made some shit wit Peppermint oil, castor oil, argan oil..

5098 2018-04-28 19:12:22 Halt for maintenance “could last for one more week”, Platts reported on April 23rd, quoting sources close to the project. Delays are reportedly due to issues connecting new Bahr Essalam development and are said to be unrelated to attack Sunday on oil pipeline to Es Sider
5099 2018-04-28 19:12:17 The use of almond butter and coconut oil made the cost a little pricy for my bike industry paycheque so I made a batch with PB and honey instead. A tasty budget alternative.
5100 2018-04-28 19:12:13 My dad has become the official #CBD oil expert in his circle of family and life-long friends, who all get their disinformation from the mass media. Today his 93yo aunt called inquiring about it. It took me 10mos to get him to try it and now he could have his own brand.

5106 2018-04-28 19:10:52 More electricity means more coal where I’m from. Trading oil for coal.  And I don’t have statistics. But I’ve seen miners destroy whole mountains for coal. Power plants don’t even run at 50% usage. Over half energy wasted. We can do better. Solar power is the future.
5107 2018-04-28 19:10:45 Yea for about 10 to 15 minutes. It’s some great benefits, but u have to do it quite a few times. I would suggest doing it and then applying the almond oil as well.
5108 2018-04-28 19:10:42 Indian Oil बेच दिया 
Air India बेच दिया 
Railway station भी पट्टे पर लगा दिया

अब लाल किला भी पट्टे पर दे दिया 

तो आप क्या घंटा बजाने और अंडे देने लिए सरकार मे आये हो?
5109 2018-04-28 19:10:37 those Frenden brushes will offer you all sorts of paint options--once you get them, be sure to organize them into different "folders". I have mine set as Inkers (w/ subsets of Nibs, Brushes, Rapidographs, Microns, Sumi) and Paint (Watercolor, Wash, Oil, Pastels).
5110 2018-04-28 19:10:30 I wonder how the Sephora oil cleanser compares to the loccitane 5% shea one...I love the loccitane one but I'm almost out and my skin LOVES oil cleansing
5111 2018-04-28 19:10:28 Wish my granny could understand the pros of marijuana, not even a blunt necessarily. Discreet oil pulls whenever can help her with pain and things like sleep smh

5113 2018-04-28 19:10:18 >Wake up.
Immediately cough up blood mixed with oil. Great start.
They're,,, really tired, but they're stiff and are awake anyway.
5114 2018-04-28 19:10:17 This is the oil industry which was going to prop up indy Scot is it? $133 a barrel? The snp shouted for tax cuts to keep the NS going remember. Was that wrong? NS oil is expensive to extract and in case you didn't know. Oil price crash was considered 'scaremongering' remember?
5115 2018-04-28 19:10:12 @FordService I travel to Mexico often, I can't even get an oil change, what happens if my car breaks down?
5116 2018-04-28 19:10:07 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
5117 2018-04-28 19:10:03 So annoying when the little people defend poisoning their children so oil execs and other fat cats can make more money.
5118 2018-04-28 19:09:45 I need an oil change though

5121 2018-04-28 19:08:59 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
5122 2018-04-28 19:08:55 His doctor is working on it.There are great RA groups on FB & where I initially heard of the CBD oil. I too am pro life and hate the disregard for life in the womb. To me, this is a core pillar of humanity. Statements like Trudeau made will have far reaching, destructive effects.
5123 2018-04-28 19:08:50 Oil is a commodity,  we can survive without it, history has proved it possible.
5124 2018-04-28 19:08:39 I really enjoy getting oil changes. Did I wait an hour for one? Yes. Did I pay too much for it? Probably. Did the mechanic actually change my oil? Who knows. But man am I glad I didn’t miss round 4 of the NFL draft while I was there, would’ve been truly devastating.
5125 2018-04-28 19:08:34 @WholeFoods just noticed your house brand Cold Pressed Evening Primrose Oil (120 capsules) says it contains gelatin in it. Does this gelatin have pork ingredients in it?
5126 2018-04-28 19:08:33 They literally do, like sex is crude oil or a vein of copper, and every sex-having man is out there building a derrick or swinging a pickaxe, and they are going through the motions and pissed they haven’t “struck gold” yet. They fundamentally don’t get being human.
5127 2018-04-28 19:08:30 I love how Mr. "Man of the People" thinks they don't make oil based paints anymore
5128 2018-04-28 19:08:29 You post a link to a place funded by oil companies that pushed the Vince Foster murder conspiracy and think anyone will take you or your opinion seriously?

The one beauty product I never leave home without is my Black Opal True Colour Soft Velvet Finishing Powder. I have oily/combination skin so using a powder throughout the day to control oil is a must and this one really works well for me.

5141 2018-04-28 19:06:29 Canada refused to be self sufficient long ago....no refinery, no government has wanted it on both sides - Federal and Provincial govts could care less about fuel prices going up, people reducing their dependence is the only answer oil companies collude pricing

5145 2018-04-28 19:06:21 Or, if there is a market let’s see! Where’s the proof! Or is this just about ramming through this oil to tide water dream, no matter what the financial or political costs, just so we in Alberta have this ability to do this to Vancouver whenever we need cash!
5146 2018-04-28 19:06:06 Natural gas and oil
5147 2018-04-28 19:05:54 and said something about corporate policy states tires with most tread have to stay at the back. Your tech wasn't honest. I'm very worried. How do I know my tires were rotated the past 3 oil changes with NTB? I'm spreading the word on social media to stay away from NTB.
5148 2018-04-28 19:05:37 Unless you want oil and energy to lead... Then you'll get a correction after inflation gets out of control. Tech leading means increased productivity. There are other tech stocks growing $MSFT $SQ $CRM $TWTR $SHOP
5149 2018-04-28 19:05:29 Very disappointed in NTB in Monaca PA.  brought my car here the past 3 oil changes. Tire rotation is supposed to be included with oil change. I was assured tires were rotated. I marked the front right tire with black marker.  I saw the same tire was still on the front right wheel
5150 2018-04-28 19:05:04 Popped in coconut oil? When I pop mine in bacon fat it's amaaaaaazing.
5151 2018-04-28 19:05:02 Depends what you think it is, I guess. Also, don't do the oil if you're a massive giggler like me. I kept thinking about Medieval poisonings.
5152 2018-04-28 19:05:01 So should the government do something to stop the Oil companies from buying foreign oil? Taxes? Tariffs?
5153 2018-04-28 19:05:00 Only AB and SK care about pipelines. I'd venture eastern Canada can buy oil cheaper from the Middle East once the pipeline cost is factored into the price.  Hence, Trudeau only needs to provide lip service.  National interest be damned.

5167 2018-04-28 19:02:41 Yes. The whole oil argument is hogwash. Prior to the war it was predicted oil prices would rise if we went to war, and they then did. Indeed Chirac said the reason he opposed the Iraq War was because it would be bad for France’s oil supply.
5168 2018-04-28 19:02:26 Just had the most amazing bath. I can’t even get off of my bed. That lavender oil messed me up for real. I’m ready to sleep
5169 2018-04-28 19:02:22 Depends on how the Canadian government passes laws. They shot down the one to make Canada self sufficient with oil and gas. Would have cut prices at the pump about 70%

5201 2018-04-28 18:58:44 It has nothing to do with a president for oil prices, it’s about the oil industry and the economy. It’s better if gas prices are high because the oil industry is doing good during that time. It actually sucks behind the scenes when gas prices are low.
5202 2018-04-28 18:58:37 Got this project started. Only ran for it for a few seconds. Started taking parts off. Lots of water and coolant in the oil. New parts on the way to bring it back to life again.

5236 2018-04-28 18:52:17 पहले Indian Oil बेचा 
फिर Air India को बेचा, 
Railway station को भी लटका दिया,
Defence Sector भी सिर्फ दिखवे का 100% FDI 

अब बारी आई है एक था "लाल किला"

फिर बारी आएगी गाँव, शहर, प्रदेश, फिर पूरे देश को बेच देगी ये सरकार 

बचेगी सिर्फ ग़ुलामी ।

5239 2018-04-28 18:52:08 But you can't be Christian and support Trump. It's like oil and water. They don't mix. You can lie and say you're Christian and support him, but you'll just be one of the hypocrites Jesus warns of over and over.
5240 2018-04-28 18:51:57 Why doesn't oil from Nfld supply eastern Canada?

And no province or govt imports oil. Its purely a private enterprise market driven decision. 

The market does whatever is most profitable. 

The only solution is nationalization. 

I'm in if you are :)
5241 2018-04-28 18:51:49 The tiny island city of Alameda is still covered with the now-unused streetcar tracks that represent a working public-transit system from the past. A system that would be so useful today. The oil industry's reach is strong and pervasive. And it's killing us.
5242 2018-04-28 18:51:37 Thse ppl don't even bother to investigate 1st before throwing out crap. Truth is irrelevant and media doesn't investigate, just parrots.

5247 2018-04-28 18:50:14 Seems to Americans especially the blacks, we all live in huts down here and use oil lanterns. And it’s these people that were sold into slavery and are second class citizens in America that disrespect Africans a lot.

5249 2018-04-28 18:49:49 Nonsense! Trump is a fine figure of a man! He should double, TRIPLE, the amount of Big Macs, FREEDOM fries, and milk shakes he consumes, daily! And instead of these people going on about coconut oil, Trump should do lard on an IV drip. #RESISTANCE

5252 2018-04-28 18:49:13 Churches do less good work than every average citizen does. Most church money goes to ultraconservative whims, politicking, money-laundered to political campaigns, big mansions, jewellery, luxuries and vacations for church's ultraconservtive so-called "leaders" snake oil salesmen

5280 2018-04-28 18:44:29 So I’ve given Deciem/The Ordinary a lot of chances but antisemitism is over the line. Anyone know of good skincare in the same price range as The Ordinary? I need to replace my Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and facial oil.
5281 2018-04-28 18:44:29 If the typewriter industry had a lobby like big oil, computers would cost $20,000 and we'd still be purchasing "white out.”
5282 2018-04-28 18:44:14 2.5 hours later and my oil change is done...
5283 2018-04-28 18:44:12 I used to watch guys do oil changes over a storm water drains at LeJeune.  Add that to the stuff we burned overseas and it is no wonder why my life insurance policy is 6 times what my wife's is...

5308 2018-04-28 18:40:27 I love Honda small engines, but the one thing I wish their lawnmower-sized ones had was an oil drain plug on the bottom. Tipping the mower on its side to drain the oil out the fill tube sucks. Oil goes everywhere.

5315 2018-04-28 18:39:39 It's not an upsell. The oil filter was out of stock so they are getting it from O'Reilly's.
5316 2018-04-28 18:39:37 I am nervous about Trump's grasp on reality.  He is oblivious to foreign cyber attacks on our elections, businesses, and infrastructure. 
He hasn't said a word about the attack by hundreds of Russian mercenaries on our troops guarding the oil refinery in Syria.
Does he even care?

5320 2018-04-28 18:38:58 Tbh I think everyone should know how to change their own headlights, oil & tire on their car
5321 2018-04-28 18:38:58 Maybe so, but how many cities have electric buses?  There is no reason to demonize oil. Oil is used in soany products besides gasoline.
5322 2018-04-28 18:38:34 Baker Hughes is the benchmarket for rotary rig counts.  I have no idea where the IHS Markit folks obtain their data but it conflicts with the trusted and true Baker Hughes numbers.

5326 2018-04-28 18:38:18 Sometimes I wonder who first thought, "You know what? I'm going to take these unfertilized chicken eggs and mix them with oil and lemon juice! I bet that would be swell! OH, and then I'll cook this fish I caught and mix that with it!"

And yet, delicious.

5335 2018-04-28 18:36:50 It's free oil money that the britons thought them how to use to the detriment of the oil owners. Yet Niger Deltans are living in abject poverty while d parasites live in affluence. When will this injustice STOP?
5336 2018-04-28 18:36:39 bobby got an oil change in our car for $16
5337 2018-04-28 18:36:39 i went for a oil change. then they was like my front brakes was scrubbing together and my car wasn’t gone be able  stop nomore.
5338 2018-04-28 18:36:34 My suggestion to @INCIndia and @RahulGandhi ji will be that they should take up high rise in petroleum products, that too when crude oil is at much lower price, which is resulting in increase in all essential items.

This is hurting common man the most
Hope somebody takes notice.

5344 2018-04-28 18:36:08 When we sell crude oil any item outside NG, any money gotten from there is in $, but we don't use $ in NG so the CBN will print out Naira equivalent to the amount and give the federal government. Automatically the foreign reserved belong to the CBN
5345 2018-04-28 18:36:01 Pharisees therefore Eli perceived that rest, and wonder, and pour oil for her husband, which is without a winebibber, a furnace
5346 2018-04-28 18:35:58 why are people missing this concept it’s so simple oh my god. certain people need certain things for them. if you have oily skin you don’t want oil based facial cleanser right? dry skin? you need products that don’t dehydrate. it’s the same for hair. what’s so complicated???
5347 2018-04-28 18:35:52 It was a good episode... but your holding back, you didn't explain how you always get the price of oil right.
You did mention what the price of oil will be at the end of the year, and the major influence on the price... chiefly yourself
5348 2018-04-28 18:35:51 Es verdad que Derwick Oil & Gas ya entro en las sanciones de la OFAC?
5349 2018-04-28 18:35:39 They subsidize oil companies, tobacco companies, corporate ag, etc. I’m not asking them to open a government operated early childhood facility I’m arguing that subsidizing childcare increases the labor market by allowing a parent/s to go back work. Who argue against that?

5375 2018-04-28 18:31:12 No I understood what you said.....20, 30, 40 years etc.  Which is basically exactly what I said....oil will be still be around for the next few generations.  We both said the same thing....only differently.

5386 2018-04-28 18:29:16 Crude oil $ can decrease due to: USA tight oil production ( lower break even prices due to corporation tax reduction )+Trade war between China–US. The impact of renewables depends on the price of crude oil. The substitution slows down wi low crude oil $ .Lot of possible scenarios
5387 2018-04-28 18:29:09 Debt is the new oil for China economy as it is for G20 and its enterprises to remain "profitable".
5388 2018-04-28 18:29:05 Nigeria has rejected a preferential trade agreement with EU, because, as an oil export country, it doesn’t feel the need for it
5389 2018-04-28 18:28:59 Iraq dropped the dollar and wouldn't use it to buy and sell it's oil...made up WMD scare gave cover for another bankers war..
5390 2018-04-28 18:28:44 Got an oil change this morning. The mechanic recognized my Jeep from having seen it driving around on the Mesa.
5391 2018-04-28 18:28:31 Dear Summer 

I need a man to rub oil on me while I tan & then leave right after.

5394 2018-04-28 18:27:33 I can't explain the difference (different ingredients?) and I've never fried tortillas. I have a strong aversion to lots of hot oil. Good luck!
5395 2018-04-28 18:27:31 @Halfords_uk how come your engine oils for different cars even though same grade in fact exactly same info on front of container for different manufacturers ie the more expensive model bmw oil compared to a Vauxhall oil same info different price

5397 2018-04-28 18:27:05 My girlfriend's dad walked into my living room full of empty Lionshead cans and a smell that he claims was "hash oil."

At least it wasn't Nattys and mids.
5398 2018-04-28 18:26:58 Right.
Except in the US they are against public healthcare and women making choices over their bodies with they doctor.

But a fetus, babies on life support, terry shivo or similar on life support and sending young men to fight over oil all good.
5399 2018-04-28 18:26:54 The only answer for Americans who act like they don't know african countries is to ask they're president where the gold, silver, bauxite, timber, oil and diamond comes from..The african Americans who will contribute in this matter di333 only God knows
5400 2018-04-28 18:26:50 Yes you did! Can’t wait for your prediction of DJT aka crook in chief, 45 the liar, snake oil salesmen, the racist orange agent ending up in jail along with family to come true very soon.. keep it up you’re the MAN!!! Respect 
5401 2018-04-28 18:26:44 Also obama has investments in the oil industry so...he would be the one to raise prices, not trump 
5402 2018-04-28 18:26:37 Gonna see if I can get a medicinal script next week. Since I've been assessed and approved for mental disability last month I don't have to pay for my prescriptions, I still have to pay for recreational weed so a CBD oil script would be savin' me.
5403 2018-04-28 18:26:02 Iraq, iran, africa, he had troops deployed at every single oil depot to make sure that nobody fucks with it.  that was the whole reason we went back to iraq. Because they took his oil supply away.
5404 2018-04-28 18:25:55 They're growing hemp in OK? That's awesome. It's as good a paper as trees, as good a cloth as cotton (for less water) and produces a decent multi-use oil. Great news, thanks for sharing!

5408 2018-04-28 18:25:17 Woke up and my dad went and put gas in my car, car wash, oil change and new wind shield wipers. God is good 
5409 2018-04-28 18:25:03 I work at an oil mine & refinery. OH&S have a rule where you're required to shave if wearing respiratory protection, so the plant areas make shaving mandatory in case of a gas leak
5410 2018-04-28 18:25:02 Lmao I came to get my oil change and the guy is trying so hard to find out if I have a man
5411 2018-04-28 18:24:41 This is @realDonaldTrump selling Snake Oil to a Snake Oil Distributor about Tax benefits DJT would "make happen" for KW...Don't think for a second either of these buffoons have any common thread other than that of greed

5415 2018-04-28 18:23:44 Oil is not going anywhere for a while.  Trucks, trains, planes & ships don’t run on feelings.  If you want to totally get rid of oil at this moment you would have to give up every item you own including home & sleep outside naked & hunt your own food.

5419 2018-04-28 18:22:53 yes Id like to see more research done to find natural cures & then expand the use of those remedies when find they exist. I was happy when mj oil was ok'd to be used to treat kids with cancer and when farmers  were approved to grow hemp in OKlahoma

5433 2018-04-28 18:20:25 I actually don't want the Oil to win the lottery tonight. Enough. We need to be able to build a competent team off of proficient prospect development, non-lopsided trades, and even better free agency signings like every other damn good team. We can't keep relying on anomalies.

5443 2018-04-28 18:19:25 Crude oil $ increased in 2017 due to: 3 pipelines w problems (North Sea, Canada& Libya)+A northern hemisphere w a very rough winter+ Bad weather in the Gulf (hurricane season) + Low production of Venezuela (worse in 2018?)+OPEC cut. Punish to Iran(?) will increase the price a lot

5446 2018-04-28 18:18:52 why are you & others drawing illogical conclusions? I've suggested putting all the eggs in the oil basket is foolish & I've also suggested Rebel Media tactics used by the #CPC are objectionable to many.  BTW peak oil won't be 50 yrs away, it'll be 20 or 30 tops or we're doomed.
5447 2018-04-28 18:18:44 I think March will be negative too. Oil rebound likely not enough to offset the housing slowdown. Housing is a greater component of GDP than energy, but likely they will tamper with the numbers.

5449 2018-04-28 18:18:35 Non esattamente corretto. La rigidità della moneta impone deflazione salariale in presenza di assenza di controlli a merci e capitali.

Venezuela was the wealthiest nation in South America in the early 90s.
Now, people are killing zoo animals for food, despite having the worlds largest oil reserves.
That's what I know. And Jones defended the regime as wonderful revolutionaries.
5455 2018-04-28 18:18:11 What would be environmentally safe?
By rail or truck is safer. Preferably over short distances. There are spills, but they're smaller and easier to contain.
There is no method of transportation for oil that is 100% environmentally safe tho.
5456 2018-04-28 18:17:42 So appreciative of @CanadianTire  in #portalberni allowing pets to wait inside while getting an oil change.  #pets #petfriendly #canadiantire

5492 2018-04-28 18:13:15 If you look at Cheney's theory of governance - war profiteering, using US policy to enrich oil interests, selling out key US values (public torture program), etc, it is only different from Trump by a few degrees.
5493 2018-04-28 18:13:14 @POTUS please help us ask Mr President @MBuhari What he meant by "Nigerian youth just like to sit down and do nothing claiming that they are oil producing nation, and so they should get free healthcare, free housing, free education" @realDonaldTrump

5495 2018-04-28 18:13:03 That's another thing. Is the wife the one reminding her husband that the cars need an oil change or that the gutters need to be cleaned or that he promised to fix a certain toy the kid is asking for? Because then the role of project manager is still the job of the wife.

5531 2018-04-28 18:08:41 I have a friend that shared so I could try it. The edibles did nothing, the smoke was great but the oil I rubbed on my knee took away all the pain. I wouldn't need opiates if I could just have that oil to use.

5534 2018-04-28 18:08:23 Don’t disagree. The resto I worked at (years ago) did a French-fried ice cream that was dandy. Roll balls of ice cream in fine crumbs, freeze on a pan. Fry fast on demand in hot oil. Chocolate sauce. Boom. I’d incorporate  into crust.
5535 2018-04-28 18:08:16 A leftie? What the fuck is that? I’ve been in business my whole life and now I live down in the most beautiful spot in Vancouver, where these oil tankers will be passing by. Caught saying something dumb? Not likely!

5628 2018-04-28 17:52:20 You are both right to an extent. Presidents do not directly choose gas prices, however foreign/domestic policy dictates how easily and how much oil we recieve from other nations and drilling in our own which dictated price due to supply.
5629 2018-04-28 17:52:20 Greg why are you always hating on the oil? It's weird.

5649 2018-04-28 17:50:11 Unbelievable Jeff!!!!! US Bombs bombing weddings in Yemen, of coarse it’s where the Saudis buy there weapons British as well, maybe it because the Saudis have oil, just saying
5650 2018-04-28 17:50:10 I have spinal stenosis Diane and just discovered CBD oil this week. Amazing!!! I may need to take a cupful for the march but will be there!!!!!!!!!!!
5651 2018-04-28 17:49:41 No more than any other part of the world, add in oil though & you have a reason for intervention. As before try a Google of "Sykes–Picot".
5652 2018-04-28 17:49:38 Sexy oil body love you with your fuck toy hot 
5653 2018-04-28 17:49:22 I’m grown sis  a oil change and some pampers is the perfect birthday gift

5655 2018-04-28 17:49:09 Like an oil lamp, our lives can only survive certain winds.  #RIPAkhumzi my heart bleed! Sincere condolences to his friends, family and the film and television industry at large. Mzansi ra lla!
5656 2018-04-28 17:49:06 If your hair is dry and your curls aren’t as tight as you want them mix mayo, castor, and olive oil, sit it in your hair for like 30 minutes. Thank me later 
5657 2018-04-28 17:49:03 i love pouring oil into my hand just to see what happens
5658 2018-04-28 17:49:01 Debating rubbing coconut oil all over me in case I end up having plans, jokes I never get invited anywhere
5659 2018-04-28 17:48:48 myth: milk causes acne. Busted: This is another misinterpretation: milkdoesn't trigger acne or breakouts. It's the hormones produced by cows that are found in milk that can actually overstimulate oil glands and causeoverproduction of oil.
5660 2018-04-28 17:48:39 my high ass lathered myself up in avocado oil n knocked out.. now everything's ruined in oil
5661 2018-04-28 17:48:23 To add to that, I was involved in screening companies for subcontracting expertise we lacked in-house and was stunned by the number of snake oil salesmen we reviewed. Real eye opener.
5662 2018-04-28 17:48:22 This CBD oil is doing wonders for me.
5663 2018-04-28 17:48:13 Or, and I have witnessed this, make cannabis pesto with garlic and extra virgin olive oil
5664 2018-04-28 17:48:12 RT if your mom believes essential oils can literally cure anything. Sinus infection? “Get you some oils”. Bad grades? “There’s an oil for that”. Can’t get a win on Fortnite? “Let me see what I can mix up”.

5672 2018-04-28 17:47:14 Who was the camera man at that Oil spill party on Gramby lastnight?
5673 2018-04-28 17:46:57 Yeah same hahah. I just thought it was interesting and hella true. But imma keep using this tea tree oil and that’s that. 
5674 2018-04-28 17:46:48 I once put ten times more oil than required into muffin dough because it was too damn early for me lol. But I had something to talk and laugh about with @smolpancake 
5675 2018-04-28 17:46:40 try getting some CBD oil online boo! and you can vape it, so you won’t actually be smoking 
5676 2018-04-28 17:46:03 P3 Trollblood Base, P3 Frostbite, P3 Morrow White. Then adjust with glazes of Citadel Reikland Fleshshade (elbows, knuckles and chin) and Nuln Oil

He’s dangerous as a personality. I don’t disagree with all policies he has but disagreements outweigh the agreements here
5679 2018-04-28 17:45:48 add oil!
5680 2018-04-28 17:45:28 ““If we lose the LWCF and Antiquities Act, we’re much more likely to see oil and gas leases on our public lands,” Coghlan stressed. Fund money has been used to purchase buffer areas around parks to prevent different types of development from encroaching on natural areas.“
5681 2018-04-28 17:45:20 I never thought to put "painful" next to "cognitive dissonance," but I think it's an accurate description. It's better than trying to force together "President" with the word "Trump." Those are oil & water. They just won't go together!
5682 2018-04-28 17:45:16 Drove past the dealership and there was NO WAIT at the service bay - UNHEARD OF on a Saturday - so here we are getting an oil change.
5683 2018-04-28 17:44:56 No, Nancy, Spotify is not an essential oil that helps remove sun spots on your skin.

5689 2018-04-28 17:44:12 Just an oil change or tire rotation 
5690 2018-04-28 17:44:03 Well thats what they say. But i mean we were suppisedly in iraq to free the people.. But we went for oil. We were in afghanastan for revenge.. But they went after the lithium. Religion is a good excuse but currency i feel is a powerful motivation for war.

5692 2018-04-28 17:43:36 How about hazelnut oil
5693 2018-04-28 17:43:34 Breakfast was a hard boiled egg, a cup of sliced strawberries, a cup of spinach w/two table spoons of olive oil & 58g of nitrate free bacon. 

HIT. THOSE. MACROS. 
5694 2018-04-28 17:43:23 Here is a true thought. Oil tankers in BC have a perfect safety record while BC Ferries on the other hand have spilled more oil, diesel and hydraulic fluid plus lost more lives. Horgan will call for an end to BC Ferries right? #bcpoli
5695 2018-04-28 17:43:20 People with facial hair need to use grease/oil to seal their skin with the gas mask.

5697 2018-04-28 17:43:00 Is it fiscal consolidation and monetary stability policies that are hampering Russia's growth prospect or low oil prices plus FDI uncertainties? I would say the latter.
5698 2018-04-28 17:42:58 It also raises a question of how positive are biofuels using palm oil in the whole concept of environmentally friendly
5699 2018-04-28 17:42:40 Put oil in my car 
5700 2018-04-28 17:42:32 #Fakenews First: 1lb of coal/50 mi is absolutely ridiculous even in a 100% coal fired power grid. 2nd: the Best gasoline car has a larger lifetime Carbon footprint than typical EV. 3rd: this admin is only out to pocket money from Oil n gas. 4th, Oil n Gas take more tax subsidies
5701 2018-04-28 17:42:14 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil.
5702 2018-04-28 17:41:46 So I just read that olive oil is considered a vegetable oil.  Do you consider it a vegetable oil and does it have these same characteristics?  Thank
5703 2018-04-28 17:41:06 Its about time the world told Saudi Arabia if they do not implement human rights for both men and women then the world should place an oil embargo on them.
5704 2018-04-28 17:41:04 For me it’s either that or Sandopolis. At least you can set oil ocean on fire with the flame shield in Mania. I had a little too much fun doing that when I first reached it.
5705 2018-04-28 17:41:00 shea butter and baby oil all summer 18.
5706 2018-04-28 17:40:49 They say you should never wish away time in your life. However, the time to election 2019 cannot get here soon enough. We need a government that boasts our world class ecological oil/gas develop’t & production. One that will attract investment & make Canada a leading supplier.

5712 2018-04-28 17:40:08 Russia’s Oligarchs have a $500 Trillion Dollar Oil Deal with Trump if only he could get those pesky Sanctions dismissed, but look he can’t. Just like Tillerson Trump should be fired.

5715 2018-04-28 17:39:50 I've used this beautiful day to change the oil on the pool-area push mower and to sharpen the blades.  Got a little oil and grease nice clean bandage, but I'll live.  The ride-on mower is next, but probably not today.  That damned pool lawn is already growing.  Crazy.
5716 2018-04-28 17:39:33 だいじょぶかーーー！
5717 2018-04-28 17:39:19 2/2: If you have a permanent bearing or material impact such as hike in fuel levy, then transportation costs rise, but if it's a fluctuation of oil price or currency, then transportation don't necessarily have to increase.

5726 2018-04-28 17:38:25 That oil snuck up on me lastnight Frll
5727 2018-04-28 17:38:19 The Romans used to clean themselves with olive oil since they did not have any soap. They would pour the oil on their bodies, and then use a strigil, which is type of blade, to scrape off any dirt along with the oil
5728 2018-04-28 17:37:59 already brainstorming with hubby about this. Make sunomono with the rest of the cucumber, type of tomatoes (love heirlooms), types of oil, etc
5729 2018-04-28 17:37:47 That was the quickest oil change I’ve ever gotten
5730 2018-04-28 17:37:47 It’s always about resources. Land, oil, minerals, money. The religion and ethnic stuff is just there to facilitate the pillaging by keeping people riled up against one another.

5734 2018-04-28 17:37:18 Shale gas is already significantly cleaner than oil, coal and wood. Why impose arbitrary taxes on what is already a clean energy source?
5735 2018-04-28 17:37:03 I GOTTA quit Hellman's. I like to make my own sauces and dressings out of it. I have tried a few homemade recipes for mayo (even w/avocado oil), but they never taste as good as Hellman's! It's the only thing I still eat that has soybean oil in it. HALP!

5737 2018-04-28 17:35:51 Are you saying you’re an Oil Tanker pilot / captain? Is this really about sailing?
5738 2018-04-28 17:35:51 Question: Do you support or oppose a severance tax on gas? @summerforpa "I would support a 6.5% severance tax on oil and gas, but before I would support that, I would support a moratorium on fracking" #summeriscoming @pghdsa

5749 2018-04-28 17:33:41 BIG OIL still gets subsidies.  Let's stop THOSE, and help the poorest and the neediest in this country.  Some people are NOT lazy, they are sick, disabled, or have something wrong with them that they cannot make enough to live.  Not their fault.

5751 2018-04-28 17:33:28 @TCHarrisonFord - after having my Fiesta ST serviced at the derby branch, I certainly won’t be going back again! This is the 2nd year that the car has been overfilled with oil and required 0.5L removing. This time round, oil was removed and it is still way over maximum.
5752 2018-04-28 17:33:22 Its a business and you don’t own it bud, Trump is selling us weapons, big Americans companies investing in Saudi, we own a lot of oil and power in the region so you guys need us. Again its a business for a free country, you don’t get to decide!
5753 2018-04-28 17:33:01 So far at the psychic expo, I've had an uncle (who is not dead) talk to me from the spirit world and that I won't have any chronic health issues.
But I've also been getting free CBD oil dabs, so it evens out.
5754 2018-04-28 17:32:57 We are looking for safe ways to support a sustainable future & in this case want to keep dialogue open. Even in the case of renewables, mining & extraction are still factors. The green shift must not make the same mistakes as the oil industry does w/ selective facts.

5759 2018-04-28 17:32:26 Maybe because Norway may actually own the oil, whereas Scotland doesn't. It belongs to (foreign)oil companies!
5760 2018-04-28 17:32:21 Yep and lets not mention that the oil price per barrel was standing at $75 ....Yet still they have a go these disgracefully biased media yoons.
5761 2018-04-28 17:32:19 A Huuuuuuge well done to team Olive Oil who’s tenancity, ruthlessness and hysteria meant they completed with 00:01 on the clock! Winners!!!  In the rainbow syndicate game none have played it with more passion  - Agent Dahling is going for a lie down #escapegame
5762 2018-04-28 17:32:11 I was thinking "damn, I wish I had some infused olive oil or something..."
5763 2018-04-28 17:32:05 You read in the news that oil prices are down but no, you wouldn't know it from the gas stations. And also, I have seen 20-30¢ differences at stations that are just a block apart.
5764 2018-04-28 17:31:57 Factors included giant oil reserves, Libyan nationalism against Western imperialism,  and Chinese presence in developing Libya....etc.
5765 2018-04-28 17:31:53 I haven't really got acne but witch hazel is really good for it and then bio oil afterwards to remove scars
5766 2018-04-28 17:31:31 My pet peeve is that the wealthiest BIG OIL companies are still being subsidized.  I wish they would publish the amounts given to each so we could boycott and put a stop to it.  Somehow, I can't find it.  Can anyone else???
5767 2018-04-28 17:31:30 omg  just micellar water and argan oil!! i also use korean sheet masks a few times a week and exfoliate with lush's cup o coffee scrub
5768 2018-04-28 17:30:22 Let me know how you like it.
And by the way,  I use Extra Virgin Olive oil not regular. If you don't like the flavor of EVO just use regular or any other neutral vegetable oil you like.
5769 2018-04-28 17:30:16 Just wanted to let y’all know that my day after drinking shits are solid, and yes I still plan to go to the pool and get tanning oil all over this borrowed book 
5770 2018-04-28 17:30:01 Followed all I wasn’t! 
5771 2018-04-28 17:29:56 What we wonder about is that the USA and their slave states made a big deal about Crimea, but are quit as a mouse about the Russian allowed annexation of Eastern Syria which leaves Syria without 90% oil and gas.and the USA with 90%, The West+Russia are quit.
5772 2018-04-28 17:29:51 @UAlberta awarding honorary Doctor of Science to #Suzuki is an insult to Albertans and a discredit to the university. Suzuki abandoned science and any kind of objectivity a long time ago in his campaign to bring down Alberta's Oil industry.

5781 2018-04-28 17:28:02 2) Until we have come up with a better way to stop spills & clean them up, no more pipelines should be built. No we won't be in the dark if KM expansion doesnt get built, the oil is being sent to China Its funny how many people think the oil is staying in Canada.

5785 2018-04-28 17:27:29 Dear God he’s like an oil spill.....can’t be contained, destruction that touches everything and everyone, vile and frightening. We are so sorry that it is reaching other shores. Thank you for your sympathy. We are doing our best to get a “cleanup” underway.
5786 2018-04-28 17:27:26 Funny enough, I feel where you're coming from. This was a "big" show for the Saudis, but in the grand scheme of WWE, this show could have not happened. The production was great though. Oil money was well spent.
5787 2018-04-28 17:27:13 Dude - it’s fresh pasta.  We’re starting with eggs, flour and olive oil.  Making it from scratch.  It’s so good, this ain’t fuckin Gia Russa
5788 2018-04-28 17:27:02 Alaskans own 74,600 shares of DENBURY RESOURCES INC, worth $192,468. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
5789 2018-04-28 17:26:29 Heads would explode all over the NHL if Oil bumbled their way into yet another #1 pick

5792 2018-04-28 17:26:10 @MavisTire I have been in your building waiting for an hour and a half for an OIL CHANGE. My car has been up on the lift for more than a half hour. The people sitting next to me have been here for almost 3 hours. The employees are sitting down relaxing.

5797 2018-04-28 17:25:40 Don't forget injecting used motor oil into the wombs of Christians.

The South Korean tabloids make the WW1 fictions of Germans cutting off the hands of every Belgian baby they could find seem quaint and plausible.

5803 2018-04-28 17:25:09 Lovely. Just can’t beat thick oil paint.
5804 2018-04-28 17:24:51 if you can’t fry chicken or anything else oil needed in your underwear then maybe cooking isn’t for you
5805 2018-04-28 17:24:36 YOU miss the point
The real victims: children/students attending under-funded schools w/dec funding every yr since 2008.
We have booming economy yet @dougducey/GOP leg give tax cuts to banks,oil,mining while cutting ed funding.

5808 2018-04-28 17:23:46 When the head of Imperial Oil says this: "Market access  constraints are already impacting the company & will force it to take a  hard look at future oilsands investments", it's a signal to resurrect the Energy east pipeline with Govt incentives AND guarantees to Transcanada Corp
5809 2018-04-28 17:23:38 There's nothing better than running that peppermint oil through your scalp lol
5810 2018-04-28 17:23:30 Still no answers on how much it will cost canadians bearing in mind we are already greener than the countries we buy dirty oil from ?
5811 2018-04-28 17:23:10 A fair point. To say South Africa was "most prosperous" also leaves out Libya, which had mad oil bux, and the former French-owned Ivory Coast.

But it does the populace little good when 99% of the wealth is hoarded by an African Big Man who doesn't believe in sharing the goodies.
5812 2018-04-28 17:23:09 Tea tree oil also works wonders for break outs! I can’t live without it lol

5814 2018-04-28 17:22:55 A report that raises awareness.I don't agree w blaming offshore platforms: a)There isn't a large number in Pacific b)Oil workers had trained in waste policy 10-30 years,before society start classifying waste(depending upon the country)People have the poorest education:see beaches
5815 2018-04-28 17:22:36 Look just because you snagged your leisure suit on the end cap isle at the drug store doesn’t give you a pass

Yes, everyone knows you went to buy mineral oil, fleet items, and the April issue of Old Farts Monthly. Big deal. Go back to yelling at grass and telemarketers.
5816 2018-04-28 17:22:34 Didn’t the great people of Montana get pepper sprayed and forced off their lands for an oil pipeline? What a shame that Mr. Jackson is having to face his demons without the torture.
5817 2018-04-28 17:22:32 I had the same kind of super fluffy nonsense response about palm oil with Lidl
5818 2018-04-28 17:22:11 I know there are environmental reasons why we shouldn't release balloons, but the professional clown side of me still loves to see this. How about we stop drilling for oil, enforce recycling in more states, subsidize electric cars, promote solar power.... and keep the balloons?

In the 90's, when the world wanted to #boycott BC forest products, #Albertans stood with you because we knew #jobs were at stake.

Now, some in BC are opposing #pipelines, essential to #oil jobs in #Alberta.

5840 2018-04-28 17:19:59 A reduction in per barrel emmisions is pointless if we just keep using that to increase production and create the same net pollution

It's a shell game.

And no, energy east was 90% for export the other 10% would have just displaced oil by rail. No net increase in domestic supply
5841 2018-04-28 17:19:59 @AliYoungBeauty is the superfood oil quite greasy in texture as especially during summer I would not want anything greasy on my skin ? And how would you advice using it ?

5860 2018-04-28 17:16:59 My husband has used CBD oil for RA flares (it did not help him but has helped others).  My point, that I realize was poorly made, was the trade off of cannabis legalization with PM Trudeau’s prioritizing abortion rights over free speech rights.

5864 2018-04-28 17:15:39 Your resource based economy was spiked when Putin broke up Wall's potash cartel and world oil prices tumbled. 
Canada's national deficit has produced an economy that is doing very well and is focused on long-term growth.
Sask's deficit not so much.
5865 2018-04-28 17:15:25 i started freezing chopped garlic and olive oil in ice trays to make starting a meal quicker and it's hella helpful but right now I have the urge to just toss one of those in a pan and let it melt it just smells so good
5866 2018-04-28 17:15:01 Good. Let them stay and make loans to non oil businesses. Alberta needs to diversify its economy, and the more investment other industries get in the province, the less succeptible it will be to oil price shocks.
5867 2018-04-28 17:15:01 Are you in oil?

5898 2018-04-28 17:11:07 But the premier may have to make room on the bill for another fossil fuel — thanks mainly to a Calgary-based company drilling in the northeastern part of the province, B.C.'s daily crude oil production is at a nine-year high and expected to steadily increase.

Depends on thickness of steak how long. If it’s a thick piece might b 10 mins. Cut into it thro middle make sure done enough

5944 2018-04-28 17:04:46 Here's an answer:  Canadians will start producing oil for themselves, instead of buying it for prices that were artificially lowered, to drive us out as a global oil market competitor. Please retweet if you agree.

5989 2018-04-28 16:59:52 Don't be a baby, baby.  Toss veggies with a  little extra virgin olive oil and roast in a hot 425°-450°F oven. Spritz with fresh lime or lemon juice. They taste entirely different because their sugars start to carmelise. Even younger kids than you love them. Honest.

6020 2018-04-28 16:55:41 Umm... Norway also has lower extraction and production costs for oil; companies are largely state-owned; and had a policy of high taxation and high borrowing to protect its oil fund. You're not comparing like-with-like.

6030 2018-04-28 16:54:45 “the science is often lacking or highly uncertain due to the large number of variables that affect oil behaviour, fate and effects.

6033 2018-04-28 16:54:24 This is a fantastic idea!  Just a reminder that if the oil from your skin can gets on a bulb, the bulb will burn out more quickly (weird but true).  Wearing exam gloves while changing bulbs gives them the longest possible life.

6056 2018-04-28 16:50:15 Omg do you have any oil based cleansers... that'll take it off rly easily
6057 2018-04-28 16:50:14 せやで〜
6058 2018-04-28 16:50:11 Venezuela was a 1 trick pony economy, oil. Price of oil went down. Trump doesn't want to help diversify economy in the U.S. with alt-energy development. We could be developing & patenting the most amazing alt-energy, benefiting U.S. economy & world.Trump puts tax dollars into oil
6059 2018-04-28 16:49:57 Not to mention all the filthy oil they use to keep the moving parts moving
6060 2018-04-28 16:49:49 votre avis @ericvidalenc  ?
6061 2018-04-28 16:49:36 Me when I asked my boyfriend to grease my scalp & he put waaaaay to much oil in my hair! 
6062 2018-04-28 16:49:36 All of the sudden Lucas Oil Stadium is gonna start feeling like Carter-Finley, Midwest.
6063 2018-04-28 16:49:26 Tea Tree oil is magic

6066 2018-04-28 16:49:08 It’s not as bad as the guy who looks like olive oil
6067 2018-04-28 16:49:05 No because Jiffy Lube broke some type of tube when they changed my oil and it leaked out.
6068 2018-04-28 16:48:49 In another 2m years, octopus geologists will identify a thin layer of plastics accompanied by oestrogen deposits. They'll conclude that a sex-hormone-producing microbe converted oil into solids, then died off after eating all the oil!
6069 2018-04-28 16:48:46 God will punish you. You know what you are doing. Leaving these posts broad enough for people to assume that you are referring to Nicki so that you can get some extra publicity to boost your lackluster single. Take it back to the drawing board and bring your coconut oil with you

6077 2018-04-28 16:48:07 The Wayne National Forest- oh that’s right it’s being leased for fracking. The only National Park in Ohio is being leased to oil and gas. Shame, shame, shame
6078 2018-04-28 16:48:07 THIS LENNY WAN IS JUST CAUSING A STIR
HOPING TO GET SOME WHO ARE NOT CONVINCED
THAT LABOUR AND TORIES ARE THE SAME
THEY WANT SCOTS OIL, POWER,FOODS,DRINKS,WIND POWER
THE WILL TAKECALL FROM SCOTLAND (again) AND THEN CAL US SPONGERS FOR GETTING OUR OWN MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
6079 2018-04-28 16:48:05 when ever there is any kind of spill all oil execs should be forced to drink water with whatever spilled, maybe then things will change for the bryter
6080 2018-04-28 16:47:55 The only way we know that the fix is not in is for the Oil to win the lottery.
6081 2018-04-28 16:47:53 Butter oil ah  I sweat myself
6082 2018-04-28 16:47:31 The oil was reported to Race Control just before the Ginetta went off.
6083 2018-04-28 16:47:31 For long term maintenance and prevention try Banyan’s Nasya oil. It has changed my life.
6084 2018-04-28 16:47:30 Here's the thing about that and it's this. 'We have the oil and they want it and have been doing this business for a very long time. You think KM failure would kill the established industry?
6085 2018-04-28 16:47:30 Oh I forgot one thing wanted to pass on. This is the first time I ever gave a puppy a bath with Dawn dish liquid.
My vet said that it will kill the fleas but you have to get the kind with the little rubber ducky on it. That’s what they use for all the oil bird babies guess.
6086 2018-04-28 16:47:22 
You always did crack me up.
6087 2018-04-28 16:47:17 Oil diffuser are lifeeeee
6088 2018-04-28 16:47:10 Time for an investigation into oil & gasoline futures trading. Being manipulated. Conspiracy, Collusion etc.
6089 2018-04-28 16:46:57 The oil Turkey was stealing out of Syria using convoys which Russian began bombing starting September 2015. Gasoline prices are "the most expensive in the world." Ok, so more reason to steal then? So dude, put down the crack pipe.
6090 2018-04-28 16:46:44 Woman: I started off as an secretary in oil & gas, but my boss saw more in me. He mentored me.
Me: Really? And now you build hospital landing pads? How cool!
Woman: Yeah I was like okay I like this. I'm away from catty women, and work with strong men who invest in me.
Me: ...oh.
6091 2018-04-28 16:46:42 I think EVERYONE got those ads for cannabiol oil.  Usually they falsely claimed to have been endorsed by this or that celebrity. SCAMS.
Don't understand your not getting "pro-GOP" stuff. I got truly outrageously distorted anti-HRC, Obama & ESP. Michelle content and images!!
6092 2018-04-28 16:46:42 Could the oil companies be deliberately trying to make KM support rise in BC? Just wondering...
6093 2018-04-28 16:46:42 SKDJKDSJK oil is Literally the only thing ive found that gets it off without hurting but i dont have The Fancy Oils™ so i used vegetable oil  THATS WHY I HATE WEARING LIPSTICK like liquid lipsticks just.  dont come off and normal lipsticks stain the fuck out of my lips
6094 2018-04-28 16:46:24 No I’ve never waxed anyone to give them a ride , but y’all gotta understand for the ones who does HAVE THEIR OWN CAR .... NOBODY WILL BE PAYING FOR SHIT BUT ME , I HAVE TO PAY FOR TIRES, TUNE UPS, OIL CHANGES NOT y’all 
6095 2018-04-28 16:46:21 ほんじゃ2万円になります
6096 2018-04-28 16:46:18 Just hangin out waiting for that right guy to apply a lil oil to those spots that will leave those pesky marks..lol Brazilian looks good though.
6097 2018-04-28 16:46:17 Gherbo-Slide
6098 2018-04-28 16:46:07 don’t mind me I’m just naked in the kitchen slathering myself in coconut oil. I’m now aerodynamic.
6099 2018-04-28 16:46:05 Why do Republicans choose corporations over people?  Why do conservatives choose selfishness over altruism?  Why do right-wingers choose oil companies over the environment?  Could these all be false dichotomies, just like your dumb little sign?
6100 2018-04-28 16:45:59 been getting less attention from woke girls  guess I have to start pouring tea tree oil directly into my dickhole
6101 2018-04-28 16:45:55  That’s Black Seed Oil shorty !!
6102 2018-04-28 16:45:55 The companies in the #oilsands are  developing new technologies everyday and our current government certainly isn’t promoting that fact. Oil will be sold whether we do it or someone else. Until fossil fuel is phased out whose would you rather buy??
6103 2018-04-28 16:45:54  coconut oil hunny. I repeat. COCONUT OIL.

Thank me later
6104 2018-04-28 16:45:53 Wow, that's so unfair -- the Oil & Gas industry probably doesn't have *any* lobbyists in Ottawa, 'cause they've scarcely got any money to pay them I guess
6105 2018-04-28 16:45:45 This is a good thing people. In SK a worker was killed when he inhaled methane near an oil well. We can still have oil wells and use clean technology. Do you guys just complain because because @ec_minister wants it? I receive royalties from oil and I'm in favour of this.
6106 2018-04-28 16:45:41 I had to leave the convo after engine oil. You don’t need to drive if you let a new car get low on oil lol.
6107 2018-04-28 16:45:40 We are still at war in Afghanistan- winning nothing - killing American Troops - Troops in Iraq no value - we protect a corrupt government there while they sell oil rights to China -
6108 2018-04-28 16:45:38 After this oil change I’m going to sleep it’s cold n I’m tired
6109 2018-04-28 16:45:19 Trying to cut the grass but my old ass lawnmower doesn't want to start. I suppose that's what I get for never changing the oil or maintaining it in any way for the past 10 years.
6110 2018-04-28 16:45:11 I have oil in my backyard
6111 2018-04-28 16:45:10 With the five year experience drivers have in BC, pricing per minute is most effective for #EV turnover. On the backlash of taxpayer $, people need to realize that trading ~$300 monthly pyts to oil co.s outside BC to paying BCHydro $50 is actually GOOD for our local economy.
6112 2018-04-28 16:45:05 the only place in UK with economic problems is SCOTLAND and it's because constant uncertainty due to threats of Indy refs have destabilised Scottish business with some company's moving to other parts of the UK & also because of the low oil prices hitting hard
6113 2018-04-28 16:44:59 i think i have some coconut oil somewhere kfndjsbs I MADE A BIG MISS STEAK
6114 2018-04-28 16:44:58 Back! For a limited time—  Magic School Bus Crabapple-marinated Limburger Boneless Ribs. It's blessed by a flavor priest and bathed in Oyster Oil!
6115 2018-04-28 16:44:55 -cut off damaged nails down and file to start fresh
-soak nails in warm water for 5 minutes to soften cuticles
-soak nails in oils (olive oil, caster oil, coconut oil)
-NEVER use nail hardeners they cause nails to crack and break
-moisturize your hand and fingers
6116 2018-04-28 16:44:54 @FoodNetwork How can a person make nice grilled chiken with only water and oil at your disposal ?

6125 2018-04-28 16:44:11 i put vegetable oil on it....? and last time i buttered the pan it only worked once
6126 2018-04-28 16:43:56 I will NEVER buy oil again
6127 2018-04-28 16:43:51 It’s basically pancake batter that is baked in oil in the oven and is traditionally served with roast beef. It’s a staple in the British diet.
6128 2018-04-28 16:43:48 India need minimum 10 lakh cr money every year budget to build Road water railway power station gas pipe line in cities port's mordanization etc still govt hardly able to spend only 4 lakh cr and it's due to govt got 2 lakh cr extra money from oil prices and it's wise decision

6133 2018-04-28 16:43:30 Gas was only cheap under Obama because ISIS was taking over middle eastern refineries then flooding the market with their stolen oil. Also, Obama suspended drilling for our own oil in the Gulf of Mexico, forcing us to purchase from over seas.

6139 2018-04-28 16:42:57 I think I disagree with that. I don’t believe that pipeline expansion is about ships to Asia at all but expanding the pipeline to Washington state cherry point refinery, and making it easier to ship oil to California.

6151 2018-04-28 16:41:53 One wonders how the strategic value of Armenia compares to the one of a major regional power (Turkey) and an oil power (Azerbaijan), both actively courted by Russia.

Couldn't it be that, at some point, Russia drops Armenia rather than the other way around?
6152 2018-04-28 16:41:53 @doug_faulkner Most people in BC want TransMountain. The line has loaded marine vessels with oil at the Westridge Marine Terminal since 1956 without a single spill. With the expansion, tanker traffic to Westridge Marine Terminal will grow to one vessel a day. @BlanchardSL

6158 2018-04-28 16:41:18 What about the poor oil executives?  Won’t no one think of them?
6159 2018-04-28 16:41:10 You can adjust this with fill level, viscosity (water, oil, both), hole geometry, # of bulkheads, add randomized ribbing to the inside to further prevent oscillations, etc :) you can make its floor slope towards the center, too
6160 2018-04-28 16:41:07 Compounds = snake oil at a really high price

6166 2018-04-28 16:40:37 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.
6167 2018-04-28 16:40:36 Hmm. Someone's not being truthful. Either the dealer where I've gotten my oil change or the shop where I had an alignment done. Shop said they couldn't do a rear alignment due to damage. Front is aligned. Dealer says the front isn't aligned, no damage in rear and rear is aligned.

6196 2018-04-28 16:37:37 Have you ever tried green clay as face masks?  Sometimes mixing a little of oil (olive oil) with the clay prevents the skin to get dry. 
It usually works well. 
There's also white clay to be used as face masks.
6197 2018-04-28 16:37:36 Wow! He’s a chip off the oil’ block! #SpittingImage
6198 2018-04-28 16:37:27 As long as all of Mr Suzuki’s ardent followers fill the $ gap. You don’t have to worry about the price of oil or how much of a deficit the U runs. You keep getting your $ while grads you pump out can’t get meaningful work.
6199 2018-04-28 16:37:11 I would love to, but where too? 
1. He is British.
2. I couldn’t be so cruel as to inflict him upon any other nation.
3. They would only send him back.
4. They might kill him, then send him back.
5. It still wouldn’t stop his rants.
Perhaps a disused offshore oil rig might work.
6200 2018-04-28 16:36:59 I mi fi tell yuh! Watch your hands, have to get some gloves: rubber palm and cotton back. And invest in Shea and virgin coconut oil.
6201 2018-04-28 16:36:51  I was busy evacuating town with my family on ur bday due to an explosion and fires at our local oil refinery. I won't forget the date that it happened! Scary day but thank goodness for minimal injuries.

6203 2018-04-28 16:36:02 Even though I’m studying to be a pharmacist I’m a fan of natural “cures” or in this case pain relief. I don’t know if clove oil is something most people have on hand but gargling with it will help with the throat pain. Also helpful when kids have sore mouths from braces 
6204 2018-04-28 16:35:59 Well I making oil dong. We go see.

6207 2018-04-28 16:35:44 Go to Bet Nija & see crowds of youths 90% below 30yrs. Go to the North & see a lot of  Uneducated and jobless youths. Go to Niger-Delta, some will tell you the oil is theirs, and as such they deserve every share of revenue from it. Perhaps he was refering to these set of youths

6210 2018-04-28 16:35:28 Just been for the first time to @blowLTD. The lady who did my nails was friendly, however my nails on the other hand wasn’t done that great. She put way too much oil on my nails after they were finished that a few of my nails are left looking matte and rather dull 
6211 2018-04-28 16:35:25 This change is inevitable. The colour of oil economy will change in next 5yrs
6212 2018-04-28 16:35:23 Also if I get a van or food truck I would make it so it runs on French fry oil or something instead of fossil fuels

6223 2018-04-28 16:34:06 I see the jobs disappearing - every day - the oil/gas workers and the businesses that surround them - service providers, restaurants, grocery stores etc.  The province is becoming a ghost.
6224 2018-04-28 16:34:04 Back then tankers were single-hull ships. Today they're double hull. Trans Mountain has loaded marine vessels with oil at the Westridge Marine Terminal since 1956 without a single spill from tanker operations. @BlanchardSL

6230 2018-04-28 16:33:27 But they have a reason. They want control of Syrian oil like they got in Libya and they want the oil pipeline from Arabian peninsula through Syria.
I expected more humanity especially from French.

6233 2018-04-28 16:33:00 Sorry, the ethical oil argument carries no weight with me. De-carbonized heavy crude is a different animal, however, because competitors (eg Mexico, Venezuela) are giving up market share and the spread of carbon pricing will give AB heavy a competitive advantage.
6234 2018-04-28 16:32:27 We’ve been some version of ‘Oil Wars’ since the ‘70’s when Carter ID’d the strategic importance of foreign oil. Also 911 and the ‘16 election w/ Russian need to lift sanctions. If reunification of the Korea’s is a byproduct, that’s great - it doesn’t change political motivation

6249 2018-04-28 16:31:18 No. The risk of a leak is nearly zero. TransMountain has loaded marine vessels with oil at the Westridge Marine Terminal since 1956 without a single spill from tanker operations. Most people in BC support the pipeline. @BlanchardSL
6250 2018-04-28 16:31:00 WHATS THE ANSWER? The most important part of the car is the engine, the most important part of the engine is the oil...so tell me WHY are we still using a DIP STICK to check oil levels.

6268 2018-04-28 16:29:02 @my_bijutsu TransMountain has loaded marine vessels with oil at the Westridge Marine Terminal since 1956 without a single spill. With the expansion, tanker traffic to Westridge Marine Terminal is expected to grow from five tankers per month to only one per day. @BlanchardSL
6269 2018-04-28 16:29:00 The way I see it, we're on a precipice. If we keep going on this path that is entrenched in big oil, we're going to fall off so we have to reverse course asap. Stopping this pipeline would be a step in the right direction.

6275 2018-04-28 16:28:44 Also, why are we we exporting it? So it can be transported to China to be refined? Why bother? Let's build a refinery in Alberta then infuse the refined oil into our market.

There's an alternate universe where the worlds oil supply is concentrated under Germany. I wonder if the German's are so enlightened about solar in that universe?

6283 2018-04-28 16:28:27 More importantly that oil from Syria should be used to finance rebuilding of Syria.

Incomprehensibly stupid far left ideological policies always costs EVERYONE! Only it will be too late to do anything about it when reality dawns on them!
6286 2018-04-28 16:27:59 They are pulling out for the same reason oil companies are pulling out. Don’t kid yourself. They aren’t in the oil business they are in the money business. They’ll go wherever there is opportunity. This isn’t about anything else. You know it. I know it. You choose not to see it.

6317 2018-04-28 16:23:38 BS!  Was in Florida for 2 Months and the price NEVER changed. Left Georgia March 18. Paid $2.16/gal got into Michigan and it was $2.59/gal. Less than 1hour after the price increase of oil was announced the price of gas went up. In Michigan the price changes every day. Ridiculous!
6318 2018-04-28 16:23:30 When you have an appointment it shouldn’t take over an hour for an oil change and to put a new tire on.
6319 2018-04-28 16:23:21 You know you’re a proper #Punjabi woman when you oil your hair after a proper workout and think about sitting in the sun with a hot cup of chai and some #Bhangra beats... Uff  #desiwoman
6320 2018-04-28 16:23:17 Yeah, I would not and did not suggest doing so. 

Socialized medicine: Problem. Needs to be removed. 

Symptom: The idiots who are brainwashed into supporting it. 

If you remove the socialized medicine and brainwashing, no longer do you have useful idiots to support it.

Its all the usual bland generalisations, like a pitch from a Miss World contestant.
All you have is vacuous unsubstantiated drivel.
6325 2018-04-28 16:22:34 Nigeria is not worried of future because the oil is a privilege to them, tell if Biafra comes who is the rightful owner of the oil will never abuse the right, the abuse is for British interest that created Nigeria problems till date
6326 2018-04-28 16:22:26 @JimCarrey what medium do you primarily work in - oil, acrylic, watercolor?
6327 2018-04-28 16:21:34 I think the only time a tariff is a good idea, or keeping a product made domestically. Is when it could impact our military capabilities,  such as, oil. If we lost the abilities to produce enough oil during a war time. We would lose , or could lose a war due to lack of resources.
6328 2018-04-28 16:21:27 @DavidSuzuki Just curious, how much #Alberta produced #JetA fuel will you be burning to fly to the @UAIberta, or have you already departed from your oil company shard island on your horse and wagon? #Hypocrite
6329 2018-04-28 16:21:13 That headline says they are just losing their grip, period.
6330 2018-04-28 16:21:07 80% of the earths population has relatively similar hair as white people so it's a majority privilege, not white. 

Hotel shampoo does the same job no matter what hair you have. It removes dirt and oil while inducing temporary psoriasis.
6331 2018-04-28 16:21:04 Tommy just put hair oil in his hair in the middle of Walmart then got mad at me when it spilled all over the ground and he had to clean it up with his hands 
6332 2018-04-28 16:21:03 Did you know the essential oil OREGANO is a natural antibiotic??? The purer the better and ours is great !!
6333 2018-04-28 16:20:49 I need you two in my life daily haha  but I still mean it, I mean kim k could put chip pan oil on her face and look beautiful and glowy and hey I'd probably buy it 
6334 2018-04-28 16:20:38 The cover reads 5W 20, meaning that's the oil specification why fill the car with 20W 50? Any justification?
6335 2018-04-28 16:20:38 Maybe Olive oil!
6336 2018-04-28 16:20:36 I’ve been using cbd oil and cream for months now it does help.

6338 2018-04-28 16:20:17 Its pretty simply really, JT wants Sharia law in . Best way to get us to embrace it is via Saudi oil. But he first has to destroy our own energy sector with regulations and make room for Saudi money by driving investment from  . 1/2

6342 2018-04-28 16:19:52 What will your party do to help them adapt? The oil industry is going the way of the coal industry....and the blacksmith industry
6343 2018-04-28 16:19:41 I support the Canadian oil industry, I question why we are the world's 2nd  largest exporter yet this industry drags Canada down, maybe because we sell out to foreign interests called USA and China. Refinery before pipelines. World glut of cheaper oil.
6344 2018-04-28 16:19:31 It’s been noted before that the fact that Canadian produced oil, produced and transported to Canadian standards and supporting Canadian programs, lifestyles and freedoms, should be the preferred oil - and that some Canadians believe otherwise is an epic PR failure.
6345 2018-04-28 16:19:29 He also doesn't seem to realise what peer review standards are, which is... concerning.

Have you ever looked at his website? I recommend a private browser to avoid polluting your search history, but TL;DR, it reads like a snake oil salesman exclusively pitching himself.

6351 2018-04-28 16:18:39 The Russian's refer to this as #GreyTerror, technique used to sew discord. It is done both abroad and nationally. Oil refinery explosions, grid outages, crashing Navy ships, etc. But I don't think #Russia is behind it. #DeepState reindeer games.

6355 2018-04-28 16:18:05 I can't stop crying. Alfie is in heaven and he can play with my Nathan, who has been in heaven since 1982. Grief is just as fresh now as then. You don't get over this.
6356 2018-04-28 16:18:05 Oil you! I was chewing a choc chip biscuit when I read that!
6357 2018-04-28 16:18:01 @cathmckenna Liar and hypocrite: you cannot fight climate change AND build pipelines, esp those that transport dirty oil that NO ONE WANTS. How can you look your kids in the eye??
6358 2018-04-28 16:17:56 2/To your second point. Funny, I'm just this minute working on my book about Alberta energy policy, which will argue that we should be preparing so that when the last drop of oil is consumed many decades in the future, Alberta is the jurisdiction that produced it.
6359 2018-04-28 16:17:51 Sad to hear. Sometimes feel they struggle at home with weight of expectation. They have to be up for a big game!
6360 2018-04-28 16:17:26 Oil industry finds fraking isn't causing the dozens of earthquakes in areas where fraking is done. Cling to the lies of the republican syncophants Dishonest Donald.
6361 2018-04-28 16:17:16 Argan oil and olive oil hair lotion and hair masks are awesome. I may get some dry shampoo today.
6362 2018-04-28 16:17:15 Mind games from the most experienced defender in Europe, which worked on our young squad!  So before oil money were you the perennial bottlers?
6363 2018-04-28 16:17:06 The exact same thing happened at Fox during the Ailes scandal. Women vouched for him... but then after the truth came out, all those same women left Fox.

The lack of self awareness here is amazing.
6364 2018-04-28 16:16:48 Man this Saturday is LIT! Going to get the lawn mower out, change the blades, oil, and the filters. This is what your 30s are all about!
6365 2018-04-28 16:16:41 Draft day three coverage is only for people who would watch literally anything the NFL produced, watch Matt Birk change his oil viewed through a knothole across the street, so why include production values?
6366 2018-04-28 16:16:32 Being more aware of your footprint is the first step to aiding these people being stripped of their basic needs. To avoid buying the palm oil used, check the packaging ingredients before you buy your products. #NatureMW
6367 2018-04-28 16:16:30 I’m only here for an oil change, I got want to here shit about anything else. I ain’t got the time today
6368 2018-04-28 16:16:30 The birds were my first venture with oil pastels. I usually just use wall paint. True story. Lol it’s cheap.
6369 2018-04-28 16:16:29 Fuel oil ? O no
6370 2018-04-28 16:16:28 Yay!! It’s so upsetting when they screw up my eyebrows ): coconut oil helps to make them grow faster!
6371 2018-04-28 16:16:28 Worth bearing in mind that - as well as Venezuela’s oil - US has kept Ortega in business. Takes 50%+ of exports (coffee, gold, clothes) in return for Ortega sealing the border to migrants. This crisis was doubtless forseen but Nicaragua’s slide into dictatorship was expedient.

6374 2018-04-28 16:15:56 TransMountain has loaded marine vessels with oil at the Westridge Marine Terminal since 1956 without a single spill from tanker operations.

6388 2018-04-28 16:14:25 Palm oil is used in nearly half of all food and household supplies.  Companies often clear entire forests of trees in Indonesia and Cameroon in order to harvest palm oil, destroying homes and animal habitats. #NatureMW
6389 2018-04-28 16:14:23 In other words keeping supply down we can charge greedy amounts for oil and gas which screws the working slaves and will lead to another recession!

6400 2018-04-28 16:13:09 Obama was President during the domestic oil boom. The row crop bonanza. And the bullet sales explosion. That's not part of GOP narrative history. But they had their hayday, fake outrage and all.
6401 2018-04-28 16:13:08 If  BC/Canada  sells oil, gas mining products today, they are denying future generations from profiting from those resources. Shouldn't a percentage be put "in the bank" for those future citizens??
6402 2018-04-28 16:13:03 The free oil money at the disposal of government and its operators makes them to use power recklessly. We all need true federalism in Nigeria.
6403 2018-04-28 16:13:01 Oil is used to make plastic. Credit cards are made of plastic, so you need oil to shop! How about that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

6405 2018-04-28 16:12:50 Unlike many western economy countries Norway has LOADS OF OIL. As a net oil exporter Norway had a cushion against the 2008 recession. Australia had mineral exports for China which kept going at 7% using debt to build infrastructure. China now has huge debt.
6406 2018-04-28 16:12:46 We need to revisit the concept of fossil fuels as an addiction. When George W. Bush said "America is addicted to oil" he was right; even a broken clock gets it right once in a while. Addiction can lead to permanent disability and death. This must be taken seriously. #climate

6411 2018-04-28 16:12:09 The nation's controlling the oil still determine the price. Are you lost or something ? What's so hard to understand about that simple fact. Our trading prices with a nation make a slight difference. And I'm talking 10 to 20 cents. But the big increase is OPEC at work
6412 2018-04-28 16:11:16 I'm pretty sure the sample "watercolor" one of them posted is oil on canvas.  Watercolor doesn't have the same depth and way of revealing brushstrokes that oil paint does.

6457 2018-04-28 16:07:05 well really the pipeline is part of energy independence. The ability to move LNG safely into VA from in the US is great for getting us off foreign oil. If it benefits ratepayers with better, more reliable, cheaper energy, and I believe it will, then it's very worth it.
6458 2018-04-28 16:07:03 So, na to steal one of the mineral resources in the South West dey your mind now? We no follow una drag crude oil in the Niger delta region o. Be warned!

6463 2018-04-28 16:06:25 Do you really think you can threaten Dogwood because it refuses to bow down to Alberta's oil greed?  You and people like you have turned northern Alberta into an unfixable ecological nightmare.  Not here!  Keep your poison in your own backyard.  You are disgusting!

6465 2018-04-28 16:06:12 For sure, my friend. Could add the 1974 Regina Pats or the great Edmonton Oil Kings teams from the mid-1960s who helped fuel the idea of Major Junior Hockey in Canada!

6472 2018-04-28 16:05:23 If one person wanted to drive their car to closest star, it would literally take 25,000,000,000 barrels of oil. #insane
6473 2018-04-28 16:05:03 Remember when gasoline prices were exploding in 2008 and it was because oil was nearly $150/barrel?

Why are we paying the same amount now when oil is half price, other than we’re gullible and have no choice?
6474 2018-04-28 16:04:44 पहले Indian Oil बेचा

6482 2018-04-28 16:03:54 @BurgerKingUK V poor experience at Manchester Airport T1 - Dirty tables everywhere. Oil needs changing for cooking your chicken. No coke. Other (fizzy) drinks flat. Such a disappointment.

#Hypocrite
6486 2018-04-28 16:03:35 I think Cheney got his oil and gas buddies every relaxed rule that Potus O put back in effect-Pruitt and Zenke as a tag team destroy and sell everything that isn't nailed down as if they own the parks- they dont it belongs to us- WE the people not oil cos, coal cos,logging cos.

6491 2018-04-28 16:02:38 That's the plan. Many of Canada's political leaders see this as a sign of success. The whole point of the carbon tax, and the pipeline fight, is to make gas so expensive people won't use it. Canadian oil is the new tobacco.

6498 2018-04-28 16:02:05 Seeing our tax dollars wasted on a pipeline is even worse, downturn is because there is a world glut of cheaper oil, Canada needs refinery before pipeline. Refinery generates real $$$$$$'.
6499 2018-04-28 16:02:00 Nobody in the future cares about the oil industry. When are the greedy, self-serving troglodytes going to catch up? The only thing petrol is good for is making solar panels. #irony

6513 2018-04-28 16:00:29 Honestly, you should. The Elites want common people divided, distracted, and pitted against one another - when in reality we're brothers and sisters.

You can lead - or help the true enemy.

6521 2018-04-28 15:59:41 Remember World Markets that every cent that is taken out from oil prices equates to one billion dollars of business in economic activities, which means Goldman & Morgan are the catalysts that fuel world economies into being setup for recessionary conditions, by jacking up prices.

6542 2018-04-28 15:56:12 I can agree with Dr. @anasalhajji because drivers will buy #gasoline to get to work even while they stop paying rent/mortgage & for other things. After other sectors contract dramatically, then #oil demand will be vulnerable (c.f. 2008 financial crisis). #oil #demand #Valero
6543 2018-04-28 15:56:10 Petrol had reached Rs. 86/- and never came down though international rates had gone down. Now with NDA government with reduction in crude oil price fuel rate had decreased and passed to the consumer. Gas cylinder subsidy goes into bank account of the holder

6593 2018-04-28 15:52:15 That's nice but also, British Columbia really needs a GigaFactory.  Our government is currently under tremendous pressure to allow the expansion of an oil pipeline.  
We can help stop this by showing people that an alternative is realistic.

6617 2018-04-28 15:50:32 OK, describe yourself as'esteemed troublemaker'. Looking at yr Twitter I'd describe you as someone who's all over the place, playing devil's advocate in anything even slightly controversial. The opposite of someone who throws oil on troubled waters. An expert on everything?
6618 2018-04-28 15:50:23 For the length/thickness of my hair i cant believe i can get it dry in 10 mins with oil in it. Like it used to take me about 20 minutes when it was like half the length only a few years ago
6619 2018-04-28 15:50:15 It's why #Fluffy so desperately needs KM. He chose unethical oil from the Mid-East & Francophone Quebec Liberal seats over doing the right thing for Canada. & if there's another rail disaster, it's on him & LPC.

6657 2018-04-28 15:46:42 Goldman & Morgan, stop playing with oil prices by hiding oil & bringing it to market. Let nature takes its course. A $2.49 per gal should equate to the $4.50 that we saw recently, especially w/ the technological advancements that are in place. $68 barrel should be < $34-maximum.

6728 2018-04-29 23:53:26 He did it because he's a spiteful little twat taking revenge on Canada for Alberta's oil sands woes. He'd rather see you drunk with liver damage than sleeping pain-free from marijuana.
6729 2018-04-29 23:53:19 It’s actually not bad, but you need it blended. I made it with butter, coconut oil, and cinnamon. It was exactly like a cappuccino to me.
6730 2018-04-29 23:53:18 1)Homemade Honey Lip Scrub   Honey locks moisture in to your skin. Honey combined with sugar (to exfoliate) and almond oil rubbed gently onto the lips will moisturize and slough off dead skin.
6731 2018-04-29 23:52:52 olive oil is the best oil of all time
6732 2018-04-29 23:52:47 Hmmmm....introducing honesty into the oil market 
6733 2018-04-29 23:52:03 Noah fence why do ppl care if things r fried in the same oil bye
6734 2018-04-29 23:51:55 .....the biggest,worst hypocrite in Canadian history, a snake oil salesman of the first magnitude. 

Literally destroyed by an actual Australian scientist.

You will be embarassed to be Canadian with this CBC four and charlatan speaking girl Canada.
6735 2018-04-29 23:51:54 Yes, the universities that preach the climate disruption religion. How easy to keep Russian oil and gas at sustainable prices.
6736 2018-04-29 23:51:45 Thanks. I had it towed just to be safe but they say it’s going to be ok. You’re right, it was low oil. I luckily caught it before it went dry. 
6737 2018-04-29 23:51:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
6738 2018-04-29 23:51:19 The recipe is on the Bisquick box. The only difference is the vanilla, sugar, and baking powder. I add melted butter instead of oil. I love pancakes

6741 2018-04-29 23:50:51 Kids came to me with the doctor kit. My temperature is both high and low. Diagnosis: “you just eat bread most of the time”. Treatment: nail oil, 6 shots, “don’t just eat bread most the time”, “stay in the bed until 10 o’clock”.
6742 2018-04-29 23:50:45 If they sprayed that wall with 90 weight oil no one would be on it. These people need to think if they want to keep people out, do things to keep them out the East Germans used to paint the Berlin wall with blister agent.
6743 2018-04-29 23:50:36 Si Maduro no cae ahorita EEUU le va a seguir comprando Oil si produc claro y mientras el guevon pasando trabajo... Ya t quiero ver como en la inmortal  del manifestant haciendo frent al tanq con las manos alzada... Creo q fue en china... Buscala abstencionista pajuo...
6744 2018-04-29 23:50:30 Ish. It’s not going to be the gloriously fried chicken of the oil variety. But it’s a decent proximily.
6745 2018-04-29 23:50:18 Statistics prove that #oil prices have been historically higher with a Democrat as President then Republican, Google it!
6746 2018-04-29 23:50:17 Any tips on getting turmeric oil off of my kitchen wall? @joliekerr

6749 2018-04-29 23:49:52 EPS for Contango Oil & Gas Company (MCF) Expected At $-0....
6750 2018-04-29 23:49:35 Go buy a couple of 4oz Jars preferably the kind you’d use for candle making.  

Ingredients: 
¾ cup brown sugar
¼ cup honey
2 Tbs olive oil

Mix until well combined and keep it closed so air doesn’t get in. It’s exfoliating so don’t use it every day.
6751 2018-04-29 23:49:34 so the 1% royalty rate on bitumin ( until capital costs are recovered) is not considered a subsidy to Alberta oil production?
#ABLeg
6752 2018-04-29 23:49:29 I got off work and hit my oil pen like 70 times while driving and now I’m high AS FUCK
6753 2018-04-29 23:49:22 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
6754 2018-04-29 23:49:19 Compra futuro de oil. Único hedge perfeito.
6755 2018-04-29 23:49:15 #CaravanOfIllegalls why aren't they spraying that wall with 90 weight oil? Y-90 weight because it stinks and you know it's there.
6756 2018-04-29 23:49:04 you realize fuel is significantly cheaper in the US, right? and that fuel in the US is based on the same futures contracts? You also realize we're a resource based economy? With some of the largest oil reserves in the world? Gasoline contracts have 0 to do with the gap in price
6757 2018-04-29 23:48:46 Likenjust reg tea tree oil ??????
6758 2018-04-29 23:48:43 Look at those mountains. Like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, those mountains will soon be dotted with oil exploration equipment.

6761 2018-04-29 23:48:20 Things I do on the night of a full moon:
- a healing bath with herbs like rosemary or lavender & your favorite essential oil with Epsom salt to relieve stress & pain.  
If you don’t have any herbs I use orange & lemon slices to make a citrus bath!
6762 2018-04-29 23:48:14 i've just found it to be super valuable to trigger combo and push a lot of damage in both aggressive and miracle-style builds. it is a way cheaper version of oil a lot of the time
6763 2018-04-29 23:48:06 The oil smell so good & it last longer 
6764 2018-04-29 23:48:01 Like subsidizing oil companies for exploration.  They don't pay it back on a oil strike
6765 2018-04-29 23:47:34 I ain’t eat crabs  in so long these bout to be oil 
6766 2018-04-29 23:47:23 To hell with the environment????? Big oil rules???
6767 2018-04-29 23:47:17 It's a personal thing, I want the Oil to be the team to break Canada's cup drought.
6768 2018-04-29 23:47:09 If American Pyscho were written today, would there be beard oil?
6769 2018-04-29 23:46:50 Try lotion and body oil after to seal it in. Tapos look for a hydrating lotion?
6770 2018-04-29 23:46:42 So last night I was watching on TVNZ news programing. It turned out to basically be propaganda for the oil companies who are very upset they won't be able to drill in any new locations.

6778 2018-04-29 23:45:15 It’s a fun but frustrating process. You’ll learn a lot about your hair. YouTube videos are really helpful! Also natural organic oil will be your Bestfriend.
6779 2018-04-29 23:45:04 Chie that wild growth oil really does work! I’ve been using it since December and my hair been flourish since!
6780 2018-04-29 23:44:51 どれフェスのはっぴは着なれてますからね！！！ よろしくです
6781 2018-04-29 23:44:33 I have the intense urge to oil paint right now but haven’t had it in me to do so for years...probably since my little brother died. I picked up oils when my eldest brother died and then dropped them when someone I considered my youngest passed in an accident...
6782 2018-04-29 23:44:25 I only use three products but they’re amaaazing: the tony moly chok chok green tea watery cream at night and then the YTTP Macai/superberry glow oil and the Japanese Biore UV sunscreen/moisturizer in the morning

6788 2018-04-29 23:43:27 .@drsanjaygupta What about cannabinoids w/o THC, like CBD oil or in already available pill form? Cannabis can be used to help people without the associated high. We don’t need more impaired drivers & the increase in ER visits for cannabis-induced paranoia & psychosis like in CO
6789 2018-04-29 23:43:15 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
6790 2018-04-29 23:43:14 I like my oil pan tho
6791 2018-04-29 23:43:05 Die hair products van healing oil zijn zoooo goed he..1 nadeel..t vervalt best snel
6792 2018-04-29 23:43:04 once again, it is laughable to have you guys talking about safety. Remember how you guys ignored alarms on the Kalamazoo River and then stupidly sent MORE oil down the line making things even worse? Shut down Line 5 before you have an even worse disaster! #ShutDownLine5
6793 2018-04-29 23:42:48 Chick peas. Sautéed in olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, lil red wine vinegar, lil balsamic glaze then finish with some butter and greens.
6794 2018-04-29 23:42:45 I’m not crying there’s just castor oil in my eye
6795 2018-04-29 23:42:44 Go, kaya mo yan! *Add Oil!* HAHAHA
6796 2018-04-29 23:42:41 Jonas Brodin. Oil would take him.
6797 2018-04-29 23:42:03 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

6800 2018-04-29 23:41:34 I’m cooking top less, midway done blowing out my hair and the oil is popping my nips 
6801 2018-04-29 23:41:15 No the bottom is much easier to work on. Check oil and service from ground or ladders I will take ground every time!
6802 2018-04-29 23:41:14 Now, who's the best oil wrestler????
6803 2018-04-29 23:40:53 Exactly. If you consume big ag, you are the problem, period. Animals are killed/maimed by huge farm equip. Shot/poisoned by plant farmers. Habitats destroyed (ie soy/palm oil), and processed on the labor of slaves (often also native ppl). Vegan is NO EXCEPTION. (Pt 1)
6804 2018-04-29 23:40:50 What i really want is for that fucked up regime to mind its business and not think they have a right to dictate what palestinians should or should not do. Let them enjoy their wealth.. 30 years and their oil will be depleted. Thank God
6805 2018-04-29 23:40:47 No word yet on the biopsy. Nothing for pain. Just doing CBD oil and OTC meds. Thanks for all the encouragement.
6806 2018-04-29 23:40:39 Notice how US is occupying the part of Syria where the most valuable oil and gas reserves are located.
6807 2018-04-29 23:40:36 If you don’t want Venezuelans  running away as refugees in you country why you didn’t vote against Maduro in OAS 2017 meeting? You abstained .. in exchange for what? Free oil ? Did you ever get free oil from Maduro? I am asking cus I don’t know

6809 2018-04-29 23:40:21 Oilfractals has been bearish oil since $42 with no educated basis, never been in a boardroom and is definitely not a shot caller. Auto ignore

6811 2018-04-29 23:40:14 Sautéed them in olive oil and garlic and a healthy splash of manzanilla and o m g my tastebuds have never been more satisfied
6812 2018-04-29 23:40:11 Dude, Jimboman just punked out Andurand (well......that is assuming that the Twitter account with Andurand's name is really him) online and turned Andurand into his bitch. Lol. I'm having a NERDGASM!!!!! LMAO
6813 2018-04-29 23:39:29 Any @FoodNetwork show with kids makes me feel really bad about my cooking skills. Like I've never even seen truffle oil in my life like what do you do with that??
6814 2018-04-29 23:39:22 *Shelby got her legs waxed and then covered with oil* 
Shelby: wow my pants will just slide right on me now 
*meanwhile complains and tries to pull her thighs apart from sticking*
6815 2018-04-29 23:38:59 I use the tee tree oil line from the body shop, and it works wonders!
6816 2018-04-29 23:38:58 They deport Kiwi crims back to NZ, why doesnt NZ deport this clown back to Australia? And "End Oil"?? I bet he drives a car that uses petrol and the boat that took him out there. Theyre all hypocrites.
6817 2018-04-29 23:38:42 I worked with Abia State Ministry of Agriculture as a field agent and a consultant under the Small Holder Oil Palm Unit, visited and established oil plans in 10 out of the 17 local governments of Abia state. This is a welcome development. If you need my services Chinese pipu call
6818 2018-04-29 23:38:39 I want to take sun-drenched, almond oil moisturized pictures by the pool or beach with someone’s daughter this summer.
6819 2018-04-29 23:38:17 Nice! It's butter, MTC oil, heavy whipping cream, vanilla syrup & then I mix it with a milk frothy thingie. 

It tastes like a latte and helps me to get enough fat in for this keto journey.
6820 2018-04-29 23:38:17 Ohhh I’ve never heard of anyone using oil for the eggs, butter yes, oil no lmao. You look beautiful tho sugar
6821 2018-04-29 23:38:03 Driving Bernie after an oil change is my absolute favorite 
6822 2018-04-29 23:37:47 I was talking to a customer and I said truffle butter instead of truffle oil and I nearly evaporated on the spot
6823 2018-04-29 23:37:38 Wow! She's really reaching.. Liz Mair's mind is full of maga gunk..Needs an oil change!
6824 2018-04-29 23:37:32 You need oil!!!! Can you get some from a garage/gas station?
6825 2018-04-29 23:37:20 “you anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows”
6826 2018-04-29 23:37:16 Tom I think you mean "our oil".
6827 2018-04-29 23:37:03 as long as you dont "oil the mit" to it.
6828 2018-04-29 23:36:48 Add tea tree oil and jojoba oil to your skin care routine. Thank me later
6829 2018-04-29 23:36:45 It's probably like OKC, the oil/energy companies own the majority if the seats, different ppl sit in them, every game!
6830 2018-04-29 23:36:37 Cuffing him in the deputy’s cuffs isn’t near enough. #dirtbag #oxygenbandit
6831 2018-04-29 23:36:32 Does anyone else use coconut oil or a lotion w/ coconut oil and their dog is constantly trying to lick it off your legs/arms? 
6832 2018-04-29 23:36:24 Why the hell would you need oil for your eggs?
6833 2018-04-29 23:36:16 おはよお！
6834 2018-04-29 23:36:14 Is that adorable little guy going to throw his life away in a war over oil in the Middle East?
6835 2018-04-29 23:36:08 she prob had castor oil in it
6836 2018-04-29 23:36:06 Not an expert, but refineries are also switching from heating oil to summer gas, which has special additives to decrease evaporation in warm weather.
6837 2018-04-29 23:36:00 Kalo gue pake sedikit olive oil campur sabun, pertamanya rendem di air hangat, terus di cuci pake olive oil+sabun, abis itu bilas deh
6838 2018-04-29 23:35:40 Should I ask them to do an oil change?
6839 2018-04-29 23:35:38 Our price increases by the litre is = to gallon increase in USA. Boycott USA gas, chevron  and esso. Exactly why we need refineries over pipeline. These increases are foreign oil  cash grabs.
6840 2018-04-29 23:35:37 Castor oil really helps my brows to grow. 
6841 2018-04-29 23:35:37 Jane stayed with Tarzan and became an ape for him. They had real love. I don’t remember that 50’s movie,, what was it called???? Oil?????
6842 2018-04-29 23:35:29 My hair hates shea butter and olive oil but ppl swear it’s the shit

6846 2018-04-29 23:34:43 I have 150K miles on waste veg oil/biodiesel. I have solar PV and solar/wood heat. I know very little ... waiting to see where the hydrogen comes from and the $/kW-hr.
6847 2018-04-29 23:34:38 When people make assumptions and dumb posts about politics...I don’t Bar an eye. When people make assumptions and dumb posts about the oil and gasoline industry, I will send them a dissertation picking apart their points.  Educate yourself!!!!
6848 2018-04-29 23:34:38 Eliminate the competition? Pretty much Putin's entire foreign policy strategy centers around raising oil/gas prices for GAZPROM's benefit.
6849 2018-04-29 23:34:35 tea tree oil, witch hazel, aloe vera, rose hip oil, etc
6850 2018-04-29 23:34:27 We can buy electric and hybrid vehicles.  If everyone did that the oil companies would be screwed.  Right now we’re powerless but they are driving their clients away.
6851 2018-04-29 23:34:16 changing your own oil has to be one of the most therapeutic things you can do
6852 2018-04-29 23:34:14 Pro tip: if you mix coconut oil in with your kale it makes it easier to scrap off into the trash.
6853 2018-04-29 23:34:13 the warehouse on wheels requires lots of cheap oil, not really a possibility in the age of #peakoil
6854 2018-04-29 23:33:52 So according to my son my job is easy to tomorrow I'll be going to the first grade and he'll be climbing 73 foot oil tankers
6855 2018-04-29 23:33:50 Most oil companies have themselves switched to alternative green energy in their day to day operations of extraction, even they are aware of the benefits of green energy ! He can cancel everything but modern industry for the most part will adhere to green energy philosophy
6856 2018-04-29 23:33:46 The enemy will convince us we have plenty of oil in our lamps.  

It's a trap !  Ready yourselves !
6857 2018-04-29 23:33:38 I checked Louis CK’s oil at a gas station I used to work at

6859 2018-04-29 23:33:26 The "Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health" should be renamed "Harvard School of Industrial Seed Oil Promotion"

6871 2018-04-29 23:31:30 Thanks! Very simple.... sautéed shallots, Serrano peppers, garlic, shrimp and basil. Sauce is fish sauce, lime juice, and soy sauce. I used chili infused olive oil. Served over brown basmati rice.
6872 2018-04-29 23:31:27 Producers cut the Thanos background because the movie was too long but here goes jerk off with olive oil Twitter telling you you’re wrong for noticing the gap.
6873 2018-04-29 23:31:26 Y’all gotta stop putting oil y’all body and making a caption saying “my skin clear” “my skin glowing”..Cut it out..
6874 2018-04-29 23:31:25 And to those who want to let them in, take them home with you and you support them
6875 2018-04-29 23:31:15 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.
6876 2018-04-29 23:31:12 How else do you propose Alberta transports oil? On a fucking unicorn? Think of the big picture. Let's not use old pipelines, or use trains right next to the ocean. Trains have more accidents than pipelines, pick the lesser evil

6878 2018-04-29 23:30:13 That’s where I go for oil changes. They don’t try to upsell me. (The two times I  went to Speedee, they tried to convince me I needed transmission or brakes service and refer me to someone. They are shady, not speedy. )
6879 2018-04-29 23:29:46 Good thing about cooking with coconut oil is if I get some on my hands I can rub it in my beard or hair
6880 2018-04-29 23:29:43 investment favours established companies over innovative companies. Investment favours old technology over new and necessary technology. The Markets favor oil over solar and wind. The Markets favor oil stocks over water stocks. Invest and destroy the earth!
6881 2018-04-29 23:29:30 I love sesame oil, it gives everything a little kick.
6882 2018-04-29 23:29:13 Yeahh, so the establishments are actually easing burden of the island's STP by tapping into public sewer canals, throwing their sewage, laundry, oil, and sh!t
6883 2018-04-29 23:28:45 I never considered not wanting to see one of them, or all of them get bean bags, or any old projectile right between the eyes as they invade my country.
6884 2018-04-29 23:28:44 That "living legend" doesn't have an official twitter verification (meaning there is plenty of reason to doubt it's really Andurand's twitter). And let's talk about Andurand for a second. His claims in late 2016 about oil for 2017 did not happen. So far, it's a bust for Pierre.
6885 2018-04-29 23:28:33 I changed my oil today and my old filter tightened counterclockwise and this one tightened clockwise and let me tell you, Lesley has never seen me so frustrated.
6886 2018-04-29 23:28:29 BC, like Indigenous people, are divided.  In Alberta, we really don't think that PMJT is onboard. The conversation should be about protecting the BC Coastline with this pipeline. Maybe upgrade the oil in Canada? Maybe making plastics in BC while recycling old plastics?
6887 2018-04-29 23:28:28 I just wanted to change the oil in my car but now I got oil all in my hair and I might need an AC compressor 
6888 2018-04-29 23:28:14 I'm sorry this happened.  Whoever trained this fellow,  set him up for disaster.  Almost cost him his life.  Always have food,  water, a map,  oil, antifreeze,  kitty litter, etc.
I feel terrible for those who aren't trained to be prepared.
6889 2018-04-29 23:28:13 Why are people still choosing to die when CANNABIS OIL CURES CANCER?
6890 2018-04-29 23:27:59 But they got all that oil!
6891 2018-04-29 23:27:57 Should we drain the oil now? Or should we do it last night?
6892 2018-04-29 23:27:53 Some gremlin stuffing their face with chicken fried in a vat of oil: Carrots are worse!
6893 2018-04-29 23:27:47 this castor oil really rejuvenated the baby hairs I didn’t even know I had
6894 2018-04-29 23:27:47 No worries. And happy to debate oil with @prpl8 whenever he likes
6895 2018-04-29 23:27:41 And Mr Trump will stop Oman and Iran oil profits from financing Hamas and Isis ! There will be peace in this world !
6896 2018-04-29 23:27:30 Alberta oil must find new markets as diversification is key to extracting the best price, which in turn drives those dependent to look at alternatives to drive a new economy.  Oil is now & will always be part of the energy equation IMO.
6897 2018-04-29 23:27:16 Oil and greasy unhealthy foods clog your pores. Eating healthy clears your face. Drink lots of water. Stop switching face products that can make it worse just let your face clear up on its own.  Give your face a break
6898 2018-04-29 23:27:16 one time my dad went into the dealership to pay for an oil change and he drove home a brand new mustang just cause. can i be on that level yet or what
6899 2018-04-29 23:27:08 Oil changed in all 4 vehicles. Also changed checked all fluids in the front loader and skid steer. Bailer looks great, and front loader is ready to go. Strum later?
6900 2018-04-29 23:27:02 Trial sizes are in! See for yourself what all the talk about CBD Oil from HempWorx is all about. #hemp #cbd #cbdoil #cbdforpets #hempworx
6901 2018-04-29 23:26:56 If the Arabic gulf countries would be not main shareholders by German car manufacturers, the electric cars would be much much more.

6902 2018-04-29 23:26:54 And Canada is concerned about oil travelling British Columbia. Go figure!
6903 2018-04-29 23:26:51 I want to go to Disneyland this week but I hve been putting off my oil change for a while
6904 2018-04-29 23:26:30 Avocado toast with a fried egg. *uaa coconut oil*
6905 2018-04-29 23:26:25 CBD oil a game changer
6906 2018-04-29 23:26:19 Like an oil painting! #Humanity is just not fair.
6907 2018-04-29 23:26:15 And just found a oil leak and my power steering leaking some where too 
6908 2018-04-29 23:26:11 We definitely need this...a lot of this,,,I don't know if it can use to oil spill in balikpapan
6909 2018-04-29 23:25:48 You give a lot of credit to @bcndp. I didn't realize they influence global oil prices... or federal tax policy put in place before our last provincial election...

6911 2018-04-29 23:25:25 When you see this is basically means to check your oil...could be low oil pressure...which literally means it’s not building enough pressure in the crankcase...check the oil levels, check to oil cap, the drain plug as well....if all those are good you may have a leak somewhere
6912 2018-04-29 23:25:15 I heard it. It gave me the strength and conviction to use random vegoil instead of olive oil (out of stock) for making pizza. Also the fancy artworks provoked floury fingers to soil my tablet .
6913 2018-04-29 23:25:05 "olive oil" I'm assuming.
6914 2018-04-29 23:25:02 はじめてお会いできてよかったです！お疲れ様でした
6915 2018-04-29 23:24:53 if you have any mint oil laying around lmao rub it on your stomach if not drink lots of water or something minty
6916 2018-04-29 23:24:43 The Trump administration is concerned about a volitile stock market. Another word, they want cheap oil period!

6919 2018-04-29 23:24:10 I'm gonna start a COOL FACTS thread. Welcome to Austen's COOL FACTS thread!

1. Razors dull over time but the main reason disposable razors die so fast is because, by design, they can't properly dry, making them rust. Put them in mineral oil when not in use to extend their lives!

6921 2018-04-29 23:23:52 I bet you also believed the BP oil spill was cleaned up in a few weeks too (still not cleaned up).
6922 2018-04-29 23:23:50 Very good point.
6923 2018-04-29 23:23:46 Coconut Oil Hair Mask , Nice Cold Drink , Topped with Nice HOT bath with a Plumeria COCO M bath Bomb! #FullMoonParty for 1 cause they fuck with me.!!
6924 2018-04-29 23:23:33 Syria has been an ally of Russia since the end of WW2. It is not Russian Imperalism. The CIA has been trying to incite insurgencies against their Ba’ath party, since 1949. This is a well known fact. It’s all about geopolitical dominance & oil & natural gas...
6925 2018-04-29 23:23:16 I need to bathe in Japanese mint oil ... everything hurts

Any SS that criticises PMB is an ungrateful human being! @1vitalsplash
6928 2018-04-29 23:22:37 Can't an asexual guy change another asexual guy's oil, as it were? ;)
6929 2018-04-29 23:22:20 And pour some oil on it
6930 2018-04-29 23:22:13 The symbol means low oil
6931 2018-04-29 23:22:12 Yup, overdid the oil and vinegar and gave me a mountain of lettuce
6932 2018-04-29 23:22:11 YOU, AN IMBECILE: Buying oil because it will keep going up
ME, A BRAIN GENIOUS: Putting 100% of my account short oil calls at $80 because blowup risk isn't a thing
6933 2018-04-29 23:22:07 Sanction Mexico and tariff the hell out of their oil, coffee, fruit TVs etc . We buy more than 80% of all of Mexico’s exports. Too many countries want our business to put up with their sh%t.  Build the wall and go oil independent. To hell with them.
6934 2018-04-29 23:21:59 oil pressure (I think).

6937 2018-04-29 23:21:39 I use the Vitamen E Oil and used the tea tree. They both work wonders.
6938 2018-04-29 23:21:26 Low oil
6939 2018-04-29 23:21:20 Absolutely, Iran too
3 hours ago somebody  (Israel) strike Syrian Army in Hama and Aleppo,  not ISIS not terrorist
Syria and Iran don't respond that because they know this region hasn't capacity for a new war
Also we know about increasing oil price if Iran enter to any war.

6941 2018-04-29 23:21:13 @ngotranslations  do you mean his "Harvard specialization" which lasted 5 days! don't make laugh! Moreover, the one that wants to keep Maduro's oil dependency is Mr. Piggy. Let's read buddy!
6942 2018-04-29 23:21:10 Absolutely! I actually have a diffuser at home and a necklace that I can put oil on and wear all day  that’s been helping! I haven’t had a cig for a couple weeks but the cravings still linger!
6943 2018-04-29 23:20:57 the military industrial complex?
Conservatives are the very best
at raising oil prices during a glut.
y'all gonna need to bomb Iran
to get OPEC to $100 a barrel tho.
I have faith y'all can do it.

6946 2018-04-29 23:20:12 What goggles, the proof is in the pudding, the worst countries in the world are islamic. Islamic world produces very little in the way of technology or science. It creates so much misery it doesn't create a thriving economy, the richest Islamic countries are rich because of oil.
6947 2018-04-29 23:19:52 i used to think i would love oil paint but u know what i fucking hate it!! it’s toxic, messy, and you get paint on your hands and clothes constantly because the paint is always wet

6952 2018-04-29 23:18:41 Keep thinking that. A memorable Kodak moment. Indeed. Hopefully you realize the first oil to go is the most expensive/dirty (meaning Canadian). But still, have a nice day!
6953 2018-04-29 23:18:33 Lol was that before the oil spill 
6954 2018-04-29 23:18:32 Housing ? What about it? Selling out to big oil? He's the first one to criticize the cartels and let USA drill frack and get USA energy independent

6957 2018-04-29 23:18:18 Oh okay I just got some that they had by the strawberries. I think I didn’t have enough but I was just trying to test it and I don’t have any oil to put. Rookie mistake lol

6960 2018-04-29 23:17:44 How is giving Suzuki going to help? Suzuki has called economists idiots and Oil Industry - slavery.  Giving him an honorary platform to push an agenda that should be discussing how to ensure the safety of BC coastline.
6961 2018-04-29 23:17:43 When did Americans get so gullible that we vote only for snake oil salesmen?
6962 2018-04-29 23:17:21 @jimmykimmel Tell us, what was the 1 joke that you were like “Damn I wish I wrote that one!”  The oil in Trump Jrs Hair? Was that the one #askingforafriend
6963 2018-04-29 23:17:16 oil paints suck and i spent one (1) hour crying about them
6964 2018-04-29 23:17:13 Oil is always how I did it. Just seen a bbq show that used mustard and I said... what the hell.  I'll go back to oil for next round of ribs.  Porkshoulder will get the mustard for a try tho
6965 2018-04-29 23:17:07 Yes the body in oil not the temple itself dear
6966 2018-04-29 23:16:50 Bit hard not to when he filmed himself doing it!

How did he survive being in the water so close to the boat doing "explosive" oil surveying? 

Was he proving that the testing he bleats about is actually benign?

6968 2018-04-29 23:16:40 mom gave me rosé and homemade lemon olive oil ice cream and i’m still sick but i feel better and i don’t wanna go home
6969 2018-04-29 23:16:31 @NTAGMN I will sincerely like our President to focus on strategic partnership aimed at deepening mutually beneficial relations b/w  Nig & USA. Discusions should center on security, agriculture, imigration, investments,transport , aviation & wealth creations. USA shuld buy our Oil
6970 2018-04-29 23:16:17 1) how cheap can a la carte toast get in a high rent city for a non-chain restaurant?
2) *house* made. no hydrogenated oil means won't keep as long
6971 2018-04-29 23:16:04 Hannity, cernovich, and Alex jones advertise snake oil supplements for money. Glenn beck advocated people trade gold for no reason. Evangelical con artists get paid to sell anointed rags and get-rich prayer. One journalist gets angry about his ex and somehow she’s the monster.
6972 2018-04-29 23:16:01 or how reliant our governments have been on resources and haven't diversified government revenue. The precipitous drop in the price of oil and the inability of the government to diversify revenue have contributed to where we are, 2/
6973 2018-04-29 23:15:56 I can relate. Naligo talaga ako sa oil. Hahaha.
6974 2018-04-29 23:15:51 Is the best thing...drizzle it with olive oil salt and paprika and stick in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 or until crispy is so so so good!
6975 2018-04-29 23:15:27 Oof. CBD oil is rough. Beer chaser tastes better.

6988 2018-04-29 23:14:04 Well, Page isn't appearing on TV any more, particularly since it's been verified that despite his denial to Anderson Cooper and Chris Hayes, Page did meet in Moscow with senior officials of Russia's state oil company in July 2016 and discussed with them the lifting of sanctions.

6990 2018-04-29 23:13:54 see the way they would defend their "hustle".. as if its one better oil company job...they dont even see anything at all wrong in it again
6991 2018-04-29 23:13:53 Did you see me type anything that says the market runs on oil ? Your seeing things or your Delusional. Oil is a microcosm of the economy. But when it comes to the Auto makers its a bad . It will cause inflation in the long run .
6992 2018-04-29 23:13:35 But I'm not drilling for oil Abi i look like nnpc or shell
6993 2018-04-29 23:13:25 Entered guilty pleas today.  Hoping to get discharge without conviction at our sentencing on July 6th. We took a stand against new oil and the government listened. No new offshore permits. Big ups to everyone who has been involved in this movement. Feeling proud xxx
6994 2018-04-29 23:13:24 Just arrived home from a great weekend of BTCC. Catching up with #C4F1.. Baku has F1 cos of oil money, apparently. Why did we never get a Hull/Aberdeen/Morecambe GP?  
6995 2018-04-29 23:13:00 I use soap. I don't use coconut oil soap BTW. I'm thinking about switching soap.
6996 2018-04-29 23:12:58 One minute it is helping you serve cabbage in your bowl. And then the next minute it flings oil onto your favourite cat shirt.

7005 2018-04-29 23:11:17 Tea tree oil itself I use for inflammation so instead of picking at a bump I put the oil on it overnight and in the morning it’s almost non existent
7006 2018-04-29 23:10:39 Why? Because Gaddafi was looking to trade oil outside of the US dollar. We will take down anyone who threatens the Petrodollar.

7008 2018-04-29 23:10:35 The versatility of it is amazing. People at my work are now telling me about using CBD oil for ailments. Hemp for clothing/paper and a zillion other things. It's fun to smoke, of course. In the next 50 years, the weed industry will be worth untold billions.
7009 2018-04-29 23:10:24 Oh, Malcolm. Now you've lost me. XXXX is the most vile thing I've ever tasted - and my mum gave me cod liver oil as a kid!

7014 2018-04-29 23:09:50 We need to get as many ppl as possible responding to the BC govt's 4 proposals for Oil Spill Regulations improvement - as well as expressing their support for the reference case. Deadline for submitting to the spill review is tomorrow. #bcpoli #SalishSea
7015 2018-04-29 23:09:30 Brent oil has been trading $73-$75 range. In order for a break to the upside will need either the EIA 914 Report or weekly numbers to show something positive. Early look on crude seems that we might see a crude BUILD this week. Price action to pause or reverse this week #OOTT

7019 2018-04-29 23:08:57 You would think that it would be cheaper since Canada is an oil producing nation.

7021 2018-04-29 23:08:39 Do you know the difference between a subsidy and a loan?
A subsidy is something windwill and solar companies get so they don’t go out of business. A loan is something an oil company will get because O&G makes up 19% of the Canadian economy.

7024 2018-04-29 23:07:29 Exam season got me day dreaming bout making onion rings. I don't know how to make onion rings. I'm not day dreaming bout ordering them but making them. Just slapping them onions in batter with them sexy breadcrumbs and slowly dunking them in sizzling oil 
7025 2018-04-29 23:07:10 Remember when Obama got gas prices from over $4 gal down to $2. With gas climbing again, who will Trump blame? Trump wont tweet about his big oil and gas buddies fleecing Americans. There goes the xtra $20 in your check Trumpsters, enjoy it, the balloon payment is still looming!

7040 2018-04-29 23:03:34 Oh, Aggro Rogue and Cold Blood is sweet and I’m happy to concede that use case. I’d also agree it’s pretty solid in this meta, I think I’m just lukewarm to it because I always liked non-CB Miracle builds and miss Oil Rogue.

7043 2018-04-29 23:03:05 Well the company notes they’ll use the pipeline to ship a variety of products, including gasoline.

I’d be inclined to trust them, rather than environmental groups that are funded by U.S. groups to keep Canadian oil landlocked.

7064 2018-04-29 22:59:35 They aren't in any way socialist. And they have tiny populations. And most have vast oil reserves. There's no comparison.
7065 2018-04-29 22:59:34 I burnt myself at work with oil and it made a nasty mark on my arm

7070 2018-04-29 22:58:34 If you don't have oil you don't have gas, heat, diesel, electricity not to mention the jobs it creates which helps citizens. I do however agree with having meteorological  instruments on oil rigs
7071 2018-04-29 22:58:26 @SimplyyLee I used a natural tea tree cleanser followed by vitamin e oil and I exfoliate with a black seed scrub which I got from a natural store downtown.... it isn’t a fast process but I’ve seen a Lot of progress
7072 2018-04-29 22:58:05 LOL. You mean like Australia banned iron ore exports and shipped steel? Saudi banned oil exports?  Never gonna happen. Ever.

7080 2018-04-29 22:56:51 I guess the question on everyone's mind is how do you campaign against oil exploration while being covered in oil-based products?
7081 2018-04-29 22:56:00 I currently smell like coconut oil, you currently smell like shit
7082 2018-04-29 22:55:59 The only countries without oil are third world ones where children die because they don't have basic needs met that you take for granted.
7083 2018-04-29 22:55:40 Sadly our oil industry isn’t run by Canadians or for Canadians.
7084 2018-04-29 22:55:40 No but oil from Alberta pays for a part of your medical your old age security for your infrastructure projects etc so if you don’t want any of these services block the pipeline
7085 2018-04-29 22:55:34 I honestly get so upset when watching my uncles wedding film. I was sunburnt to another level. I was that idiot that wore baby oil in summer. 
7086 2018-04-29 22:55:32 Because you never lose. Even when it appears you should. They don't understand why God has gifted you with so much talent, way beyond anything ever seen. But they don't know the cost of the oil in your alabaster box. The price you paid to carry so many women's deliverance in you.

7096 2018-04-29 22:54:39 tea tree oil has such a strong scent what the fuck
7097 2018-04-29 22:54:19 Small tankers up the East Coast from the States. And big tankers from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Norway, Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Ivory Coast...for no particularly good reason other than Mayor Coderre apparently prefers importing oil to using Canadian oil.
7098 2018-04-29 22:54:02 Maybe you know this, but Genndy Tartakovsky was storyboard artist on Iron Man 2. There's a very quick shot of oil splattering onto War Machine that's a clear Samurai Jack reference.

IIRC his other confirmed contribution to IM2 was the car alarm gag.

7102 2018-04-29 22:53:26 To be clear: I do not support XRP

And to answer your question broadly:

No, cryptocurrencies are not being used to prop up inefficient, corrupt subsidy programs for Big Oil/Retail/Auto (roads) and arms manufacturers, or pay to kill other people (many times civilians).

7110 2018-04-29 22:51:49 Kansas actually failed due to a 50% drop in crude oil price. Trump's tax cut has been undeniably successful. However, feel free to voluntarily pay more on your CT or Fed returns...we all thank you!

7112 2018-04-29 22:51:45 No.  Just a little country being bullied by bigger countries who want their oil...again.
7113 2018-04-29 22:51:39 It's quite obvious to the world that the Oil Rich Arab states had led a worldwide bullying campaign against Israel.  Which is why all the small countries and Euroweenies have to vote against Israel, or the Arabs cut off their oil.  That, however, is changing.
7114 2018-04-29 22:51:34 It's simple. Wages were rising, then the Brexit vote happened, the pound fell, inflation rose causing real wages to fall. Growth is slowing which will also slow wage growth. Our only chance is inflation falling, but the pound will remain weak and oil prices high so unlikely.

7142 2018-04-29 22:46:39 9/11 brought everyone together, it was what "The Powers That Be" did w/ the world wide empathy, selling a bill of false goods that started the war for oil was when you started seeing the divide, claiming those who were against the war were against 'the troops' :P
7143 2018-04-29 22:46:33 I had a 64 Corvair, worse auto I ever owned. O rings leaked oil by the quarts, repaired that leak and then it blew oil out the top. Ran hot continually. I hated that car and sold it at a loss. Rather ride the street car. Other than that nice car.
7144 2018-04-29 22:46:26 Favourite thing, Seth was like “oh, the film about oil”?!?
7145 2018-04-29 22:46:23 Bout to buy myself a big bag of Sichuan peppercorns & gonna try to make some chili oil this weekend also 
7146 2018-04-29 22:46:22 I make Extreme oil which is cannabis oil concentrated about 28:1. One dose breaks addiction  to opioids immediately. The desire and need are just gone. The Holy oil is given to them as well as it gets rid of pain from withdraw. (Amongst the many miracles it performs).
7147 2018-04-29 22:46:19 If science does not have a roadmap, then what does? The book Drawdown listed a number of best practices. Personally, I think some milestones are called for. Oil company bankruptcy should be an early goal. Followed by regional food and energy independence.
7148 2018-04-29 22:46:14 #OOTT please only tweet about Oil or Oil Related......
7149 2018-04-29 22:45:28 If you pour 1 litre of water into 10 litre of oil?
Will it be 11 litre of oil in one year?
Think...
If you pour 1 litre of oil...
7150 2018-04-29 22:45:28 Shit mum, danilo died after drink oil
7151 2018-04-29 22:45:27 62 for the lulz
7152 2018-04-29 22:45:17 No pity, it's a $154.9 where I live in Ontario.  BC doesn't like pipelines, it's on them.  In Ontario I am forced to use blood oil because Energy East was canceled.  Thank you eco-terrorists for making the worst countries on earth rich, still emissions and driving us into poverty
7153 2018-04-29 22:45:15 No shit. 

Also, it's not Vancouver blocking oil. It's the BC Govt, aka John Horgan, blocking the Pipeline. 

And one more thing, why do you assume that because I live in Metro Van, I support the protesters? cause I don't. Not if it's going to plunge more people into poverty.
7154 2018-04-29 22:45:03 Dude it was the cheap “vegetable “ oil that all restaurants use.
7155 2018-04-29 22:44:39 ぺれらんくんお疲れ様でした 打ち上げでいつも以上に楽しそうにしてましたね^^
M3会場でぺれらんくん探そうと思ったら現れたのなんでですか？？
7156 2018-04-29 22:44:13 Ya! I live in oil country and we rely on it big time but fuck that noise. 1.80 for premium is bonkers! Wait I’ll we cut you off. It’ll be three bucks then!
7157 2018-04-29 22:43:57 You would have to think they have had plenty of looks at Ty Smith as a group. Would be interesting to see what oil do if he's there @ 10
7158 2018-04-29 22:43:54 You're busy taking selfies while 2018 budget is still unattended to more than six months since it's presentation by the President...You will be alright at last.
7159 2018-04-29 22:43:49 So pleased you like yours, it’s just pure pleasure for me to make them, waking up at sunrise to activate them, the whole thing - Made a love oil for someone 3 weeks ago and she met someone on Saturday 
7160 2018-04-29 22:43:43 Indeed! Samurai Jack especially did these VERY well. And the "they're just robots" thing allowed the animators to push the limits for the type of violence they could show. They could get away with so much by replacing the blood with oil!

7162 2018-04-29 22:43:23 You are doing oil painting
7163 2018-04-29 22:43:20 So I just ordered the @beautybakerie oil cause I’m gonna do a retry of my initial review video and see what we can do! 
7164 2018-04-29 22:43:20 Donald J. Trump is a great man! He is one who stands out among the many sheep of lobbyists & the snake oil salesmen who call themselves Democrats. As for the RINO, since it will be hard to multiply during the "Trump Age" they will go extinct like their brethern the do-do bird.
7165 2018-04-29 22:43:18 Tea tree oil soap or shampoo might help :)
7166 2018-04-29 22:43:04 I apologize I totally forgot! I use the Shea Moisture 10-in-1 Renewal System Hair Masque and the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque. What I usually do is I’ll mix the Masque with Argan and Coconut oil.
7167 2018-04-29 22:43:04 Macleans's Magazine is great for starting camp fires. I also line my bird cage with it. I also put it under my drain pan when I change my car oil.
7168 2018-04-29 22:42:57 4 tbsp Olive oil,  1 tbsp paprika, 2 tbsp dijon mustard, 1 tbsp garlic, 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper. I do that after microwaving them 3 or so minutes.  Marinnate, and throw on the grill.
7169 2018-04-29 22:42:54 My fav part about watching the boys prep for Haka is seeing them doin pull ups on the windows and rubbing baby oil on each other’s bodies
7170 2018-04-29 22:42:48 Trump is humor impaired. He doesn't understand a joke he can't leverage in a way that flatters him, reflects his shallow views or satisfies his insecurities. I'm going to be looking for foreign oil every time Don Jr. on TV..LOL
7171 2018-04-29 22:42:45 .@beautybakerie can you use the Cake Mix foundation without the Wake & Bake Face Oil if you have oily skin?
7172 2018-04-29 22:42:44 Pretty sure his eyes are open. Ontario has a tax on the tax charged on fuel. Carbon taxes and all the other rediculous "environmental" add ons won't help...being forced to ship oil to the US for refining is also rediculous as well....
7173 2018-04-29 22:42:43 - baking soda 
- aloe vera 
- sugar scrub
- almond oil 
- papaya 
- honey and lemon juice 
- tomatoes

7174 2018-04-29 22:42:40 In this situation that we find ourselves,  is rare to find such people who will saw your money felt down and return it back to you..
7175 2018-04-29 22:42:36 Mmm peanut butter, sesame oil & Frank's hot sauce is great to fry #tofu in. #vegetarian #veggies #vegan
7176 2018-04-29 22:42:20 Reuse old sriracha bottles for cooking oil!
7177 2018-04-29 22:42:12 ambi fading cream, vitamin e oil, shea butter
7178 2018-04-29 22:41:57 Anyone interested in THC oil extraction get at me. DM Only! 

Machine press your dry herb into oil! So easy lmk
7179 2018-04-29 22:41:51 Changed my oil today and it made me wonder why businesses charge so damn much, it’s legit so easy
7180 2018-04-29 22:41:40 Another snake oil salesman, but, on a very grand scale. Pray hard enough and God will line your pockets with gold? He's preying all right (notice the spelling). Sounds a lot like brainwashing to me, as well.
7181 2018-04-29 22:41:35 Wait for Big Oil to finish..... Yes I mean that finish.
7182 2018-04-29 22:41:28 Tea tree oil
7183 2018-04-29 22:41:19 Perpetual failure Lewis finally coming under close scruntiny this just adding to the list of the failed snake oil salesman
7184 2018-04-29 22:40:43 Wow...great job harli..keep it going in pa next week
7185 2018-04-29 22:40:43 I’m watching a yacht pass by the rig everybodies drinking and fishing tuna having the time of their life , I’m in a jumper covered in oil and grease in places you never knew it could go with 2nd degree wind burn... my level of desperation to gtf is off the chart rn lmao
7186 2018-04-29 22:40:27 I have worked in every western province as well as two continents. I have found other employment in other industries while oil prices crashed and there was no work in the oilfield. Not as exciting as putting up signs or mentally taxing I am sure but it is what it is.
7187 2018-04-29 22:40:27 I’m already knowing but that shit smell like men ion want that. This oil spray I got be working just gotta spray a lot 
7188 2018-04-29 22:40:15 And you might get your head blown off in a war about oil and money.
7189 2018-04-29 22:40:11 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
7190 2018-04-29 22:39:55 Why should they. The U.S. is importing their poor & Mexico's revenues, via money transfers from the U.S., has surpassed their oil revenues. It's a win win for Mexico.
7191 2018-04-29 22:39:50 I was finally able to get my oil change with the correct amount of oil and my damn money back for my dipstick!
7192 2018-04-29 22:39:39 Obama was the perfect choice for Americans to project all their hopes & dreams onto. It worked. Obama increased drone strikes, took oil $.
7193 2018-04-29 22:39:31 @NZNationalParty promises to repeal the charter school ban, the oil exploration ban, and the regional fuel tax. Is anyone keeping a list? Do they plan any policies at all?
7194 2018-04-29 22:39:18 I wouldn’t lose sleep over it.
7195 2018-04-29 22:38:57 Grandson loves Zamboni the best still !
7196 2018-04-29 22:38:50 Is rosehip oil okay for oily skin?
7197 2018-04-29 22:38:33 So no one likes coconut oil anymore ? I need answers #teamnaturalhair
7198 2018-04-29 22:38:32 Thank god for CBD oil #amirightoramiright
7199 2018-04-29 22:38:20 My patent-attorney ‘friends’ are from 20-plus years ago in Houston TX where I had long career in downhole oil & gas equipment... no longer have contact (some are dead)... Surely Affimed filed for US Patents as well (one would think/hope)
7200 2018-04-29 22:37:57 Also the woman in front for me at the store bought mango and I'm now terrified the oil is on my food so we'll find out if I have a reaction I guess

7205 2018-04-29 22:36:52 I bought huile de ricin from Paris coz apparently that stuff is better then castor oil and works magic in terms of hair growth  so if it doesn’t I’m gonna bottle the shop on Château rouge x Apparently huile de serpent from new organic is good as well so I’ll try that too
7206 2018-04-29 22:36:40 It doesn't make sense to you because you do not know what you are talking about. BC Hydro is clean energy and electric cars in the lower mainland are charged by BC Hydro stations, and taxis and transit are electric here, we are transitioning off oil. BC Hydro is publicly owned.
7207 2018-04-29 22:36:34 Dunno what that was supposed to mean do U need some eucalyptus oil and a hug
7208 2018-04-29 22:35:39 dreamt that iiml was stressing me out  so much i ran away to our friend’s place where he makes (waiheke gold) olive oil (buy it) for a shower

7217 2018-04-29 22:34:31 You were already dealing with it because @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP have sold their snake oil “fake news” to the ignorant misguided masses. A comedian’s routine didn’t make it worse.
7218 2018-04-29 22:34:22 I will speaker phone anybody in a heart beat because I don’t like my phone getting makeup/face oil on it

7232 2018-04-29 22:31:45 I am highly versed with reports. #SiteC will power electric cars of which hydro power stations are already built and used. You want alberta oil and gas owned by offshore and Texas, that's really ignorant. #bcpoli
7233 2018-04-29 22:31:43 @drvox if oil goes over 100 again how much will battery bus demand change?

7239 2018-04-29 22:30:41 I hope you cooled your hand down immediately. If you have, please use cocnut oil on your hand, I SWEAR it works wonders. I once poured boiling hot espresso over my hand, used coconut oil and the pain was gone SO fast. Feel better soon.

7243 2018-04-29 22:30:26 Florida sinking.
Governor sold state to oil fracking.
Results are clear Florida sinking.
7244 2018-04-29 22:30:20 This is also what happens when oil money is drying up due to new leaders emerging on the market and alt fuels. Shoot if they wait longer we should offer nothing and they will take it.

7250 2018-04-29 22:28:41 So I put tanning oil everywhere besides my feet and now I have white feet and some what tan legs rip
7251 2018-04-29 22:28:26 Olive oil was the placebo in this case. As I understand it, this is a major point of contention for a lot of doctors who are parsing the data. Why not use a true placebo, rather than olive oil?
7252 2018-04-29 22:28:18 one more room to pack the Kitchen ugg its the worse one.  Oil change this week and digging out my bed boards in his messy garage is a nightmare

7254 2018-04-29 22:27:54 Dropped my car off for an oil change at 11, got a call at 515 (they close at 5) saying it was done and they could wait TEN more mins for me to get there to pick it up. I live 20 mins away.

7259 2018-04-29 22:27:22 LITTLE PLEA FROM ME
If you want to make predictions about the future of oil, recognise that EVERYTHING is cyclical:
* investment 
* production growth 
* consumption growth 
* efficiency/conservation 
* costs
* prices
* stocks 
* inventories
* exploration
* refining margins

7263 2018-04-29 22:26:47 Not sure re: FH and you may be aware already but increasing good chol (HDL) [more olives, olive oil etc] mops up the bad cholesterol (LDL) [animal fats, butters] so you can have a two pronged approach to reducing chol pre-statins.

Not.
7273 2018-04-29 22:24:56 Trump leased the land to an oil company, who removed the tree to make way for drilling equipment.  Naturally, Trump gets a cut of the profits.

7278 2018-04-29 22:24:45 Why does anyone want the appearance of strength, but no ability to go with it? Injecting oil is a shortcut. If you use anabolic steroids, you still have to train hard.
7279 2018-04-29 22:24:39 Assad flags say it's a fire in oil depots

7291 2018-04-29 22:22:49 Take care, better be authentic than just voicing what you think that wanna's be heard. Never put oil on fire.
7292 2018-04-29 22:22:45 Try lavender oil it has helped my sleep so much.
7293 2018-04-29 22:22:04 Every oil well in the Middle East and most in Africa are part of the guns-for-oil economy. And we who buy the oil -- we are funding the wars and propping up the the regimes that arise from the control of resources. #Iraq #Kurdistan #ISIS #Alqaeda #Syria #SoSudan #Libya #Nigeria

7302 2018-04-29 22:20:04 I spent a weekend immersed in bike culture and this is what I learned: 1) beer people fun 2) consultant groups lame 3) oil & energy bossy 4) olds are far more athletic that you’d think. #BPMS150

Me: Are these oil wars?
You: No
Me: Explain.
You:These conflicts arose from soviet intervention and attempts to create proxy conflicts in the area during the cold war. 
Me: Wow... your actually THIS wrong about basic history.
The indoctrination is strong in this one.
7312 2018-04-29 22:18:49 We use hemp seeds and hemp oil as a part of our regular diet, hemp seeds in oatmeal on salads burgers macaroni etc. Hemp oil can be incorporated into salads easily. Superfood.

7317 2018-04-29 22:18:17 Tell us, Abu - what did your people ever do before the West discovered oil ?
7318 2018-04-29 22:18:08 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together.

7326 2018-04-29 22:17:32 Yoooo @beyondwrestling clean up that oil on the outside.  Someone is going to die.  And not in the good way.
7327 2018-04-29 22:17:26 It’s my habit to use examples in discussions, and I meant nothing by it. I just don’t think £54 for a case of Neck Oil is “expensive” based on the quality of the product.
7328 2018-04-29 22:17:26 This ain’t smart, it’s dumb and dangerous. Let me know what happens when the foil pan burns or the she don’t realise it got a hole and that oil leaks into a fire. They made pans FOR. A. REASON.

7338 2018-04-29 22:15:22 We can lay one old wives tale to rest; Drinking a shot of all of oil does not in anyway shape or form reduce the effects of alcohol. You will still get drunk This is been a public service announcement.
7339 2018-04-29 22:14:49 US forces are currently fighting Iranian & Syrian government forces over an oil field which has the potential to fund local fighters for years to come.  It is a fight for the money to keep on fighting: nothing more, nothing less.

7344 2018-04-29 22:13:41 Sections so the British/French etc can exploit their bits. Dividing Nigeria  up in such a way that will forever cause issues.. Certain countries are geographically blessed (coastal) + natural resources (oil). The West must always interfere & destabilise: Libya, Iran, Nigeria

7351 2018-04-29 22:11:41 Surely there can be no one in this category. However, if you go to the factory I hear that the chocolate there is more pure. But still, it's mostly hydrogenated oil these days.
7352 2018-04-29 22:11:23 As well as oil etc.. it's a complete package..
7353 2018-04-29 22:11:19 BRAVO!
7354 2018-04-29 22:11:15 Foreign oil company Kinder Morgan must not be allowed to build a huge, high pressure pipeline through Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley drinking water sources! Sevenfold increase in supertankers off Vancouver Coast disastrous!

7360 2018-04-29 22:10:13 Conservatives  2019 will kill the Carbon tax, get our oil to market.They also will never say we are not part of society. Never call all Canadians racist. Never say we are Nazi's and Neanderthals! We will once again be treated with respect and a valued part of Canada.

7378 2018-04-29 22:07:51 Sounds like oil price is ultimately a function of KSA + Russia.  Has it ever been otherwise in recent history?

7383 2018-04-29 22:07:24 Scotland is one of the richest countries in the world. Our problem is one of expenditure. Take out oil and we’ve ran a deficit every year since 1980.

7402 2018-04-29 22:04:46 It’s not based on oil. It’s based on the fiscal transfer. I thought you would have known that.
7403 2018-04-29 22:04:46 Has anyone mentioned to them that lots of people have founded their own micro-nations? Granted, a few are literally abandoned oil rigs in the middle of an ocean... but then, they might like that.

7429 2018-04-29 22:00:18 Yea I heard of them today and was like... what is this thing, must find out... so confused. All the websites for them feel like snake oil. So I went on amazon to find real reviews about these things and was like wtf?
7430 2018-04-29 22:00:10 I still have that leftover flat beer from last week's soap, so I'm going to do one where I just use a bunch of stuff and see what happens. Coconut and olive oil base because I'm trying to finish those out. Egg additive. Swirled brown mica/cocoa powder for color. Cedarwood/lemon.
7431 2018-04-29 22:00:08 Did You Know:
There is a myth that once you switch to synthetic oil you can never switch back. This is completely untrue. You can switch back and forth at any time. In fact, synthetic blends are simply a mixture of synthetic and conventional oils.
7432 2018-04-29 21:59:48 one morning I woke up after getting blackout and realized I managed to put jamaican black castor oil on my lashes.... in the moment I realized drunk me really was That Bitch
7433 2018-04-29 21:59:45 Speculation is not knowledge...deflecting is a tactic

He's simply throwing oil on the fire to aggrandize his (useless) position
I so dislike slimy politicians who act always for their own gain, never the nation's
7434 2018-04-29 21:59:38 It sucks. Used to be able to eat it. Now, it’s so bad, I can tell it somethin has been fried in the same oil as shrimp or if shrimp was grilled on the same part of a grill.

7437 2018-04-29 21:58:57 That Feel the Love Go video got me thinking about the almost humorous duality of cults and snake oil types... painted to look nice on stage but melting under the bright lights, held together on pills and adrenaline. Totally sparked a story idea that I've been playing around with.
7438 2018-04-29 21:58:56 I landed in Ottawa at 5pm.

I picked up Cayde at 545.

One block from my apartment my truck decides that was a good place for a serious oil pressure fault to happen.

So I parked it and ordered an Uber. I've got Avengers tickets. The truck is Tomorrow Katze's problem.
7439 2018-04-29 21:58:30 Told the mother I’d a sore throat, so she gave me holy oil and said I’d be better in the morning.. #dontevengotomass
7440 2018-04-29 21:58:23 So oil is now running out in 2023. Who would’ve thought 
7441 2018-04-29 21:58:20 Well yeah if Trump were to threaten to bomb Israel or Russia oil prices globally would rise because they’re traded on future markets and speculators would push up prices because the potential future demand
7442 2018-04-29 21:58:18 Lol they said it was nice. They have a CBD oil u drop in your mouth too and it gets you so crazy high. I assume u could put in a drink or food or something too.
7443 2018-04-29 21:58:15 If oil could save a nation then surely it would have saved Venezuela, the nation with the largest proven reserves of oil in the world. But you and I know what is up with Venezuela and if oil has not saved her, it will not save Nigeria-ATIKU ABUBAKAR

7446 2018-04-29 21:57:47 Great series, but, parsimony. Panicking about eater getting into panels or drive motors, why weren't they sealed (panels) or positive air pressure (drive motors). I'm an ex Chief Elec, then offshore oil, these things are there, and not expensive
7447 2018-04-29 21:57:47 We must undertake far reachin economic reforms 2  atract private resources, includin financial resources n build biger, stronger n more dynamic subnational economies. W must expand d frontier of private sector activity beyon d realm of d oil sector n build a new Nija without oil
7448 2018-04-29 21:57:45 Absolutely not safe. Actual aluminum stock pots fall apart mid cooking. The heat of the burner combined with the heat of the oil, will degrade the pan. My fear is that it degraded before the food was done.

7463 2018-04-29 21:56:00 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7464 2018-04-29 21:55:52 @msnbc When media talks about trump base, angry old white men & their families, stop making it sound like these ppl know what’s what.n I wish you’d ask them about policies not trump! Do they want to sell national parks to oil co.s?
7465 2018-04-29 21:55:45 Those mirrors can be scary things when you work at the #NationalPetroleumNetwork. Have you checked for the blood in the money supporting them? Oil tycoons like you!  And having the nerve to talk about a state owned Propaganda Network? #SMDH

7469 2018-04-29 21:55:32 3. There is indeed over-dependence on oil taxes right now. So what? Most countries will show an over-dependence on some item or the other. Such 'high' taxes being collected are presumably being used in building infrastructure, social welfare, defence expenditure, etc.
7470 2018-04-29 21:55:30 Who drafted this wish list? Chia??  This makes no sense! Does not solve any major problems with the Oil! Faulk...maybe, but expensive, Maroon...love to see him return, but doubtful as son is on the east! The rest of list contains too much unproven/dead weight!
7471 2018-04-29 21:55:21 Oh i love Indian foods especially the mega hot curries 
I always bake my potato chips oil free, using either baking paper or a oven rack over a baking tray so no turning required. Sweet potato cubes are my fav atm so quick and so delicious as cold leftovers

7481 2018-04-29 21:54:11 Once again @TalladegaSuperS has not been kind to @Brendan62 and the Beard Oil Team, we got caught up in wreck and then cut a RF on the last lap to finish 22nd.  See you all in July @DISupdates #nascar #geico500 #talladega

7483 2018-04-29 21:53:51 Uhhhh, I slice them into fours or quarter them, and toss that in my cast iron with other ingredients and either oil or water depending on what I want.
7484 2018-04-29 21:53:46 2. I've seen India take some revolutionary steps of late to reduce dependence on oil. In fact I already see India taking centre-stage in leading the alternate energy revolution worldwide.
7485 2018-04-29 21:53:23 Beard oil! That sounds like it could be fun. Like, you could take him to an Ulta and talk shea butter versus coconut oil etc.

I'm mostly a baker at heart but i can pan boil a good steak from a roast so... isn't there a weed oil like vegetable oil but with the essence of weed
7493 2018-04-29 21:52:04 Boiling in oil.
7494 2018-04-29 21:52:03 There is nothing as addictive as states that are dependent on their monthly share of revenue from crude oil sales and the only way to get them to manage their economies in an economically viable way is to cure them off that addiction. Nigeria needs to be restructured.
7495 2018-04-29 21:51:54 no cheese, extra oil 
7496 2018-04-29 21:51:50 Obviously only Obama’s fault.. Obama had the oil checked on the limo, why should I have my people check it again?
7497 2018-04-29 21:51:37 West Africa sold humans, the same way its sold minerals and oil. If theres a demand somewhere, theres a supply somewhere elsw. Slave trade was practiced as far as bible times. There was no pan africanism or african identity. It was just business.
7498 2018-04-29 21:51:32 That’s true but only because of the period from 1980-1990. Since then we’re a massive debit. Even that will run out in about 5 years. Overall we’re in debit going back over a century despite oil.

7506 2018-04-29 21:50:17 Sorry I was in process of settling down to burn midnight oil
7507 2018-04-29 21:50:15 The NPV came to about $5m/well.With 4-6 wells funded that'd be $20m-$30m, a lot -forget the hamster wheel, just patience.And those numbers don't take into account the above av. oil find & higher price of oil

How much'll the new deal make.Something feels off,my guess the NPV

7515 2018-04-29 21:48:28 Why is it that people who suck on the end of oil pipelines always believe they should be allowed to destroy land and water while the rest of the world should be happy they are doing so. All so you can buy a bigger shiny object than your neighbour has.

7520 2018-04-29 21:47:46 Dear Prateek, 
In general, according to the Egyptian P.S.C.s, profit oil is split in this way: 20% to 30% to the contractor and 70% to 80% to the Egyptian company that is part of the P.S.C., for instance the Egypt General Petroleum Corporation (E.G.P.C.). 
Thank you.
Kind regards
7521 2018-04-29 21:47:35 BC says it’s primary concern is the threat of #TransMountain marine oil spills, but then excludes tankers from the reference. Makes no sense whatsoever to me.

7523 2018-04-29 21:47:22 It's Scotlands Oil......Professor McCrone's main criticism of their analysis was that their forecasts were "far too low". He put the sum at about £3 billion.

7526 2018-04-29 21:46:53 The three snacks that I would recommend would be 1.carrots with hummus, 2. apple slices with almond butter or 3.popcorn but instead of using butter try olive oil or try adding seasoning instead of butter. Best of luck.

7530 2018-04-29 21:46:15 What's pathetic is how Conservatives resort to childish insults and how scared they are of #FreedomOfSpeech and new ideas like #RenewableEnergy. Instead they want to keep using coal and oil which pollute the environment. #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet #AlbertaWhine
7531 2018-04-29 21:46:10 Don't worry, by the time most oil reserves are depleted, we'll have efficient battery tech to make switch less painful. Until then, DRILL BABY DRILL
7532 2018-04-29 21:46:03 He acts like Harper so much it's scary. Oil workers don't care for them. I know many from the Maritimes out there. They think he's a flake with no knowledge of what they went through during and after that fire. Jason Kenney has little chance to get power.

7539 2018-04-29 21:44:34 The article doesn't really touch on France serking preferential access to Libyan oil in exchange for supporting rebels and preventing the creation of a gold-backed pan-African currency based on the Libyan Dinar to replace the French franc in former colonies.

7560 2018-04-29 21:40:56 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7584 2018-04-29 21:37:45 The flaw in your logic is that while Alberta supplies middle America  with cheaper oil, its doing so allows for the export via the Gulf States  of their oil onto the Global market@ a global price. Reduce the oil glut in middle America & the $ will soon reflect supply & demand.

7588 2018-04-29 21:36:53 Were you there when she sold her oil? My order was rejected yet you write alternative facts. She sold 5000 pieces, period.  And if you don't like it, produce your's. Now Teddy is the one following her. Thought you guys said he was going to leave her. Focus on your life #BBNaija
7589 2018-04-29 21:36:40 I had a dream I was taking a real hot bath with some bath salts and lavender oil.. woke up feeling relaxed as fuck.
7590 2018-04-29 21:36:33 I use coconut oil for literally everything! Best product... EVER!
7591 2018-04-29 21:36:26 Probably. May have used informal hotline today to tell Assad/Russians to back the eff off or risk another Feb. 8. AFP reports 9 pro-Assad troops, 6 anti-Assad troops dead. Unleash hell Feb. 8. Light touch today. Both worked, it seems, to keep the oil fields in US-friendly hands.
7592 2018-04-29 21:36:11 Bill Maher did a bit "Liberal Fake news" yeah its called "Assad gassed his own people so we must stop him but totally not because we want to build an oil pipeline"
7593 2018-04-29 21:36:07 Oil, inelegance cooperation, lot of investments, education and list goes on. But if I took all day to explain and give you true info, you still won’t believe or don’t want to just because we have a religion and you’re an atheist.

Drugs-immuno or otherwise, juice, oil, sugar, salt or anything else in excess like alcohol ect.

intoxicate and inflamme the body

Most cancer-99% is caused by concentrates, so are all inflammitory deases

That is the TRUTH
7605 2018-04-29 21:32:50 Thinking about topics for Oil Class this week at Editions : )
7606 2018-04-29 21:32:42 That's the best part. Full tank every day and rarely ever think about finding a place to refuel, no more oil changes or keeping track of them, no tune ups, no weasle service managers...
7607 2018-04-29 21:32:30 it’s good! the oil is amazing

7610 2018-04-29 21:32:13 It wasn't.

Because if it was we would have actually gotten oil.

It was about Saddam throwing women and children into wood chippers, which I guess is something you're into

That's not my scene.
7611 2018-04-29 21:31:49 @DunelmService how many heart oil burners do you have in your warehouse stock? I'm trying to order a bulk on the website but it won't let me do it :( and my local stores don't have any or very minimum in stock...
7612 2018-04-29 21:31:43 Tell the neocons they have oil.
7613 2018-04-29 21:31:40 People should know that nothing os free and you have to work for what you want. Snake oil salesmen can sell you that you are entitled and it sounds great.  At this point, people should know better.
7614 2018-04-29 21:31:37 That @oil_shaeikh guys was here recently ranting about how soldiers are forcing him to stay in the sun because of saraki, now that the picture of him taking a selfie joyfully with saraki is out, he deleted the tweet and pretend like nothing happened... 
we know what you are
7615 2018-04-29 21:31:30 For me I feel graduate school would be a living nightmare.  For me it's more just studying to do commercial or studio career art, while being in all these classes where they treat you like you're going to go and become an oil painter presenting work in galleries lol
7616 2018-04-29 21:30:49 That's true.. I've seen customers drop off their used oil jugs by the auto parts counter for disposal. Why did it make to floor I haven't a foggy clue lol.
7617 2018-04-29 21:30:48 #Oil is a complicated commodity-you need someone who knows the business to successfully invest in oil.

7627 2018-04-29 21:29:21 My poor sister was half out of her mind at the pain and itching of the stubble. I had no idea until she went through it. She didn't shave or wax; she just massaged in coconut oil every hour or so. I'll keep waxing in mind if she ever goes through it again.
7628 2018-04-29 21:29:06 Did you drill holes and soak the log in oil for a couple days? Really cool way to keep it contained
7629 2018-04-29 21:28:37 It’s a same thing.. save environment by stop using oil.

7655 2018-04-29 21:24:51 If it's anything like my plan, you won't like it very much Sir. 

Carbon is an advantage and we look forward to using it to liberate even more valuable Oil & Gas resources.

Much more. Millions of barrels per day more! 
7656 2018-04-29 21:24:43 100% Joe. Everyone thinks it won;t get any worse until BOOM, crazy shit happens.....again. The tinders are smoldering. All it takes is someone or something to throw oil on them instead of water. Sleepwalking to disaster. #rememberthepast

7658 2018-04-29 21:24:30 Btw I'm sure Saudi Arabia also has a lot of sun and they still drill and USE oil.

Here's the catch: You can't store and/or sell sunlight. Not in the same way.
7659 2018-04-29 21:24:25 Ohhhh nice! I’ll tell her  maybe she’ll have some luck. Any particular type of oil?
7660 2018-04-29 21:24:17 And Canada has sold out to foreign companies, have to give away oil to USA refineries who sell it back to Canadians at greedy inflated price!
7661 2018-04-29 21:24:08 One of my customers today builds wind turbines. We all got to talking about how green they are. Apparently each one requires a massive amount of oil to keep running properly, and maintenance requires frequent oil changes. He wasn’t impressed with how green they are, FWIW.
7662 2018-04-29 21:23:46 Yes. They're orchestrating an NK win for Trump in return 4 a commitment 2 look the other way when Putin exploits the national resources in Syria. We know Trump thinks we missed an opportunity 2 take the oil in Iraq. It won't happen again.  And Assad- he gets to remain head clown.
7663 2018-04-29 21:23:43 What is your favorite Essential Oil? How about we turn that frown upside-down wit ... #Aromatherapy #thecuring
7664 2018-04-29 21:23:27 I think Trump pulled the old Nixon trick where he appeared unbalanced (he could be of course) and capable of ordering NK to be nuc'd. This persuaded the Chinese to stop oil sales to NK and push them into the open arms of South Korea. So a combination of all three.

7675 2018-04-29 21:21:59 Silly regulations! Now we are “free” to once again dump effluvium from coal mines into our streams! Yay, what a win for oil/gas/chemical companies. Oh and we can now use the pesticide that was banned cause it causes cancer on our crops again! Yay, what a win for agribusiness!
7676 2018-04-29 21:21:56 No doubt there will be chaos.  This is not like when Britain went down.  Much bigger war machines.  And the fantasy that oil is going out of style at the same time kills me.  Governments and unfettered CB’s have created giant Ponzi schemes and left the kids the bills.

Got it from Redbubble(.com) - they have all kinds of random Peterson designs. This one says "Dr. Peterson's Sort Yourself Out Syrup" like a snake oil salesmen type thing lol
7685 2018-04-29 21:20:01 Apparently they forgot to put the oil cap back on after changing my oil so my car’s fucked up now.
7686 2018-04-29 21:19:58 I just had to mix some cold coconut oil with my dogs food using my hands. Worse experience of my life

7692 2018-04-29 21:19:18 Once you’ve had real 100% olive oil, you will be able to know how bad most olive oil really is. If it smells like crayons and has an oily mouth feel, throw it out.
7693 2018-04-29 21:19:15 If you people in government would build Gas Refineries in Canada, you would not have to send the oil South and bringing gas back. Taxes could be lowered and therefore lower gas prices.

7696 2018-04-29 21:19:05 Sorry to disagree with you, but I lived and worked through the 1970s.

The 'sick man of Europe' thing came AFTER we joined the EU, it was the oil crisis & the unions that nearly brought the UK to its knees.

We had inflation of 20%+ & 10%+ interest rates AFTER we'd joined.

7699 2018-04-29 21:18:57 Hi Guru --- Indian here. Just my 2 cents.

I *wish* I grew up on ghee and coconut oil. My mother, like most Indians since the late 70's, used various "healthy" PUF oriented "vegetable" oils. Ghee was always in the house, but only used as garnish on top of daal.
7700 2018-04-29 21:18:41 broke hamilton is the best band ever !! Love a mirror van  Marylin Manson  Maddie Champs  Kelvin Abs  Jojoba oil  Dum  I love the other 69 of them !! 
7701 2018-04-29 21:18:39 Sorry do you have any olive oil? Thanks
7702 2018-04-29 21:18:18 Can I volunteer to be your shared foxtailed oil boy? 
7703 2018-04-29 21:17:54 While this is true, i think it would be prudent to think of dose response. Technological advances in production/distribution have resulted in abundance of ghee, coconut oil etc. resulting in exponential increase in consumption vs say 100 years ago.
7704 2018-04-29 21:17:41 And Horgan can’t bring up concerns without being attacked by the oil lobby and their media about pipelines.

7709 2018-04-29 21:17:24 The only olive oil I will buy is from the olive oil store where they have a reputation for freshness and have the olive oil on tap to taste. It costs more but the taste is amazing. Nothing like REAL 100% olive oil.
7710 2018-04-29 21:17:19 Read my past post if you have cancer or want to avoid it

God said do not eat the FAT-trim it, because heated it turns to OIL

Hamburger contains about 20% fat called 80/20

If you went to my resturant and asked for a 10 oz steak

and I gave you an 8oz steakk and 2oz of fat ????
7711 2018-04-29 21:17:08 I go to do an oil change on me Impala, have everything ready, can't find my oil filter wrench fml.
7712 2018-04-29 21:17:01 That's ridiculous. Take a course in logic. Or economics. Or history. Successive governments have invested billions to help Alberta's oil and gas industry. Stop listening to proven liars. You know who I mean.
7713 2018-04-29 21:16:57 Yeah maybe ! The girls lost a lot of it though as only Benny and Bjorn get the songwriter credits and they dabbled in oil and lost a fortune allegedly so who knows prob down to last £60m!
7714 2018-04-29 21:16:48 What's the oil for? 
7715 2018-04-29 21:16:40 Astoria’s MARS portfolio remains heavily exposed to #Commodities (#Energy, #Oil, #Aggs, #Metals) and late cycle equities (#EM Equities & #FX, International #Value (mainly via Japan & Europe), International #Momentum, US Large Cap Banks, Energy Equities, & MLPs). #factors
7716 2018-04-29 21:16:35 Well said Lorrie, I support that too, but the government has other plans, gas was $140 a litre. Gas hasn't been that high in many years. Our own oil is trapped in the ground by fools like Justin, who thing we can save the air, while China pumps out 25% of the total, ours is 1.5%.
7717 2018-04-29 21:16:19 Well, that's May's human shield gone, then. But then considering the heinous scum waiting in the wings to replace her, we might be better with the devil we know than letting Mirror Universe Adam Adamant oil his way in. #Rudderless

7743 2018-04-29 21:12:12 Bullshit. This is paid for by the palm oil companies who are destroying forests, animals, habitats, ecosystems and people. Palm oil is not fit for human consumption
7744 2018-04-29 21:12:11 This happens all the time on our dirt road... mattresses, TVs, furniture, lumber and milk bottles full of oil. Either they’re to poor to take it to the dump or they just figure the county will pick it up, which they do sooner or later. Everyone pays for their garbage.

7753 2018-04-29 21:10:46 It is better for you to use matte foundations because your face won’t look as oily but you should try and find an oil control primer and setting spray that works for you and just powder your face all over x

7765 2018-04-29 21:09:16 Coal lost price advantage to natural gas, but eventually oil and gas prices will increase, and coal will retain a slice of the energy market. However, it's evident the global warming prediction used by the IPCC for "business as usual" case was bullshit

7817 2018-04-29 21:01:45 Lol leave her,its a family affair
7818 2018-04-29 21:01:37 Also, we know for sure, that crude oil makers, aluminum makers, iron ore makers, are doing that.
7819 2018-04-29 21:01:30 I think of Heiligenstafthafen with Oil rations for years.
7820 2018-04-29 21:01:20 Olive oil, always
7821 2018-04-29 21:01:01 Hahahaha! I just get so confused. Like I’m no oil painting but ffs. Then I see someone in a shit outfit get like over 100 and it infuriates me. #likemypics
7822 2018-04-29 21:00:52 I could have sworn you said you needed flax-seed oil.
7823 2018-04-29 21:00:50 I agree and have said so in my last 2 federal lawsuits against Gov. Butch Otter (ID). Otter is a most cruel cabal member that got into office by saying he was cannabis friendly. He lied of course and we were stuck with him for 3 terms. He won't even allow CBD oil so I sued him.
7824 2018-04-29 21:00:48 Religion claims God exists in order to get your money & power over you.

You make the same Claim, by saying God is snake oil.. tho you have no proof that's true. 

So what is the difference between you, & religion? None.

Atheism is fine, but bad atheist arguments are not.
7825 2018-04-29 21:00:42 Alberta needs to shut the oil supply off!  Drive the price up higher!
7826 2018-04-29 21:00:41 @mitch__lowe @moviepass @MoviePass_CS Mitch Lowe is a snake oil salesman. He won’t face the angry subscribers beyond the lame company line he has CS send out over and over. Coward.
7827 2018-04-29 21:00:40 In 2017 alone, we imported 10.1 million barrels per DAY of petroleum from 84 other countries. In petroleum is crude oil. Which is used to make gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, etc. The US needs oil, no? So, if the price of petroleum (crude oil) increases, we have to pay more (1)

7832 2018-04-29 21:00:09 "what do you have in your hand?" the prophet asked • "Just a little oil..." the woman replied.  • "A little oil is all it takes," says @DrHeidiBaker  "It changes everything!" #LTFA18

7834 2018-04-29 21:00:03 April 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7835 2018-04-29 20:59:43 if you find yourself at an art show don't lean against someone's art :)) fr ppl were leaning against all my art and it's all colored pencil/oil pastel so if there's any smudges I'll be pissed
7836 2018-04-29 20:59:25 Become a chef to use tea tree oil for warts.
7837 2018-04-29 20:59:21 As an adult period you should keep up with your car maintenance but if you’re a woman that has a whole nigga, no reason why your tires should be balding or ya oil change out of date...
7838 2018-04-29 20:59:19 this is a pathetic . Kutengwa ne cooking oil ne rice reku China risinga ibve.
7839 2018-04-29 20:59:07 I mix my nivea lotion with either olive oil or coconut oil to prevent my skin from drying up
7840 2018-04-29 20:59:04 miss playing Sunday football out at West Indies oil
7841 2018-04-29 20:59:01 Yeah well, we won't see it until big oil dries up. Then *poof* it will magically appear
 (back from Tesla's documents).
7842 2018-04-29 20:58:31 Hahahah look very young her sir
7843 2018-04-29 20:58:30 Not gonna lie. 
But I would be low key trying to sniff you because I love the smell of citronella oil.
Its my favorite smell of spring/summer.
7844 2018-04-29 20:58:20 Also. Aussie leave in condition is really good. And eco styler gel the flax seed and castor oil one
7845 2018-04-29 20:58:18 There are so many non- pure olive oils out there.  Our olive oil is certified organic and is extra virgin olive oil!  #acropolisorganics
7846 2018-04-29 20:58:12 Use bio oil x
7847 2018-04-29 20:58:00 hoping the Trump/Tesla connection is a real thing and this stuff gets released.  He's already got a bullseye on his back, might as well REALLY piss off the global oil/pharma gouging cabal
7848 2018-04-29 20:57:55 I think I'm right in saying that the EU allows the smaller countries on Russia's borders to buy Russian gas and oil at one fixed price throughout the EU. This is important, because as we know, Moscow is quite prepared to use energy prices as a weapon (just ask Ukraine).

7851 2018-04-29 20:57:37 First attempt at roasted cauliflower steaks. I'm not into trendy food per se, but it was an interesting way to use a 10p cauliflower from supermarket reductions. Actually it worked very well, sprinkled with olive oil and homemade curry powder, and a splodge of mango chutney. 
7852 2018-04-29 20:57:28 Like what?? Trump wants to bring oil/coal jobs back when every other country is moving toward solar power. They won’t have a care in the world if we are #1 export in oil/coal & laugh at us & tell us they don’t need it. They’re working toward jobs of the future.. we’re not!
7853 2018-04-29 20:57:06 Want a free cab Tucson? LYFT is giving promo code for up 2 $50 bucks. Enter XX4 as LYFT code. Skip Uber. Super coup. oil
7854 2018-04-29 20:57:03 Been getting a oil change since forever , they take to long bruh.

7856 2018-04-29 20:56:40 Breakout the flaming arrow & boiling oil!
7857 2018-04-29 20:56:28 Always baffles me some of the recipes that come up when you search for ‘healthy meals’ - carbonaras and sauces made from 90% oil are not the one!
7858 2018-04-29 20:56:26 Please ask Daddy Dragon if he is the voice of KIPPER the Dog   (cartoon) lol   412 use coconut oil on yr gorgeous hair each month! 
7859 2018-04-29 20:56:23 Oh look. Little oil squirt is finally piping up again.
7860 2018-04-29 20:56:17 I've run back-to-back prints that fail w/o oil & succeed w/ it. How that affects material properties would be interesting to know, but hardly matters if you can't finish a print w/o oil. This was a special case & I don't typically find oiling necessary with proper HW/settings.
7861 2018-04-29 20:56:10 Anyone know where I can get an oil change from on this hot Sunday??
7862 2018-04-29 20:56:08 And then we called the President names when he said some youths are lazy but expecting to feed on oil money without works.
7863 2018-04-29 20:55:49 Argan oil shampoo and conditioner is my favourite thing ever, my hair feels and smells AMAZING
7864 2018-04-29 20:55:48 2.5 weeks.... I’ll bring the oil!
7865 2018-04-29 20:55:46 I’m dumb smacked off the oil
7866 2018-04-29 20:54:59 So I just poured 300ml of Olive Oil into my glass instead of ice tea.
7867 2018-04-29 20:54:44 COT DATA TO PRICE DIVERGENCE

AUD price lower but net short decreased

OIL(WTI) net long decreased but price held highs
NATGAS same as oil

Interestingly GOLD net longs at Dec ‘17 levels but price barely dropped,there is catching up to do
Higher interest rates killing long basket
7868 2018-04-29 20:54:42 Oil, you are the fag who is causing  dissension, Tracy works harder than any of you Lot to find truth for us, I wonder what you have ever done except complain?
7869 2018-04-29 20:54:41 $3.2 Billion in subsidies to the oil industry in Canada every year (plus untold millions more for KMX) versus a few summer jobs?  Don't worry, I think the balance sheet is still in your favour.  #stopkm #kindermorgan #line3
7870 2018-04-29 20:54:36 I suppose that makes things more complicated.
Me and my father are oil and water so we don't fight but we don't mix. Guess if he caught cancer I would be rather unshaken by the news.
7871 2018-04-29 20:54:21 Good bread makes good olive oil amazing.
7872 2018-04-29 20:53:52 Time to endorse "middies", meet with Kanye and Snoop Dog...and Rihanna...and begin plans for more oil wells and refineries.
Talk about a whirl of a couple of years.
All of the above should be icing on the cake.
I would like to be in the backgrnd of those pics, with you & the abov
7873 2018-04-29 20:53:34 We heard there is oil in your hair. 
7874 2018-04-29 20:53:30 Cooking It With Some Hot Avacado & Olive Oil With Chilis For A Bit Of Added Flavor!!! :)

YIIIIIIPPPPEEEEE!!! :)
7875 2018-04-29 20:53:26 It's a little softer. It's cotton from an old broken hammock that was bleached and dyed and had mink oil worked into it.  The right is new hemp rope from @twistedmonk getting its first outing.
7876 2018-04-29 20:53:20 I wanna be your oil bitch again
7877 2018-04-29 20:53:19 You can’t compare something like Neck Oil to say, Carlsberg, though. It costs about 5x as much to make and that’s before you bring the economy of scale into play.
7878 2018-04-29 20:53:12 It’s some Peanut oil in the pantry .
7879 2018-04-29 20:53:00 Yes, they want oil and power by any means. Truly Mafia
7880 2018-04-29 20:52:54 Does anyone want to go w me to get my oil changed on Tuesday at like 7am cause I'm a lonely boy who misses his friendos
7881 2018-04-29 20:52:52 If you have tried CBD oil, drop us a comment below and tell us how it's helped you
7882 2018-04-29 20:52:49 Wow I’ve been doing my hot oil treatment wrong for months 
7883 2018-04-29 20:52:45 I will be receiving my cbd oil tomorrow. I'm so tired of getting ripped off from all these other suppliers selling snake oil. Looking forward to a long and lasting relationship with u guys.
7884 2018-04-29 20:52:39 
7885 2018-04-29 20:52:39 Not sure what this squaline oil is about but baby my skin did a 360 in texture 
7886 2018-04-29 20:52:38 If the oil/gas industry had any brains they’d push for natgas/bi fuel setup for automakers(like Saudi Arabia does) and argue they are better for the environment than lithium, cobalt, etc mining and battery manufacturing/disposal
7887 2018-04-29 20:52:04 F is not an easy person. She is not one to be happy or please others. She is radical and sharp. Some people here question my loyalty to her. We are water and oil. But I love her to bits.
7888 2018-04-29 20:52:01 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
7889 2018-04-29 20:51:55 My favorite episode of Parks & Rec is “Two Parties” and I love it but the fact that it takes them so long to drive from Lucas Oil Stadium to St Elmo’s Steak House is ridiculous.
7890 2018-04-29 20:51:53 Oh it is only attached when oil price goes up 
7891 2018-04-29 20:51:52 A plastic sign, polyester clothing, rubber rain jackets, and how do you get to where your protesting? All because of oil. But take the money given to you by Buffet to block a pipeline so he can line his pockets by shipping the product on rail. Smart
7892 2018-04-29 20:51:33 Because the Russians were paying so much to government and paying Tory mps to socialise I think something happened that the Tories didn't like, so they turned on them, it was highly likely to do with money or oil, or both
7893 2018-04-29 20:51:24 “Comedy” is quite a stretch. Telling anti Trump jokes to a room full of Trump haters = it doesn’t get any lower, vibrationally speaking. Plus she just wasn’t funny. “Getting oil from Don Jr’s hair”(seriously??) Womp womp. #MichelleWolfe
7894 2018-04-29 20:51:10 I can’t even imagine. Prices appear to be completely or at least partially detached from oil prices.
7895 2018-04-29 20:51:09 I used holistic mosquito repellant which turned out to just be 100% citronella oil and now I smell like the a cookout in the seventies.
7896 2018-04-29 20:50:49 Maxim knows I had to go get my oil changed and tire fixed so I've been out all morning / day 
7897 2018-04-29 20:50:39 Great Ambassador Rep of Biafra Love you. Your support for Israel is Biafra power and  Biafra love you. Biafra promise Israel free oil and gas for ever from May 30 2018 when we shall be free. Biafra Love you Ambassador and need your support sir Shalom
7898 2018-04-29 20:49:54 I like how this guy was flirting with me when i was giving him my info for the oil change and out popped my dad like, "oh this is my daughter...*blah blah blah*" thanksssss
7899 2018-04-29 20:49:50 Okay corporate news sources don't take the bait This Time cover important subjects like, I don't know, global warming, acidification of the oceans, obliteration of our nation's wildlife for greed and oil, trampling on Native Americans' religious beliefs, shit like that!
7900 2018-04-29 20:49:46 What are your thoughts on oil cleansers?

7903 2018-04-29 20:49:21 @RichardBertinet DOUGH is the best book by a country mile, & I’ve got a few bread books. It comes with a DVD too, which is a brilliant teaching aid. Mr Bertinet is Premier League to Paul Hollywood’s Sunday League! Paul Hollywood puts olive oil in his baguette recipe!! Case Closed

7907 2018-04-29 20:48:47 @ketodietitian what would be a good substitute for almond flour and coconut oil/flour? I see a lot of recipes for "bread" or "waffles" for example, that call for almond/coconut flour. Unfortunately, I am allergic and would love to make some of these recipes. thank you in advance.
7908 2018-04-29 20:48:45 Can you imagine what the pump price will be if oil goes back to $100/barrel?

7911 2018-04-29 20:48:13 Even with stories such as #slaveryinthegulf it is quite unfortunate that people wil still go to these countries, just like people who still scoop oil when a tanker rolls.
7912 2018-04-29 20:47:51 Its coated with a omniphobic layer that repeals oil and dirt. But even still she could use a bath

7914 2018-04-29 20:47:46 Do you oil your garage door chain at least 3 times a year? And in our climate how often do we need to replace the door’s weatherstripping?
7915 2018-04-29 20:47:45 How about you quit this wizard and warlock shit? How about you tell the TRUTH about caner CURES? Cannabis for one. The Holy oil of Christ and Extreme oil.
7916 2018-04-29 20:47:33 i'm definitely going to do this. b/c i already know the next batch i make will be too much. the plant is a good size, at this point. i just wouldn't have thought the oil would allow it to freeze (which, in retrospect, is dumb).
7917 2018-04-29 20:47:20 Everything I own is covered in coconut oil
7918 2018-04-29 20:47:19 I lose my lip oil at least 3 times a month but this time I just can't find it

7920 2018-04-29 20:46:16 And they turned the lights off for the oil during practice lol. I literally couldn't give a crap about water bottles being thrown at your garbage team. They deserve it after the years of crap you guys pulled.
7921 2018-04-29 20:46:00 I wipe oil off dishes after use and discard it for compost, rather than washing oil down the drain. #ProtectTheOcean 
7922 2018-04-29 20:45:58 Olive oil & wine seem to be good lubricants as well.. to slide in that civilization bit ))

7925 2018-04-29 20:45:20 Demand mostly, about 1.5 million barrel is the annual increment of oil demand plus other factors such as wars, world economy, & weather.

It is not Saudi Arabia nor other oil producing countries who control the oil prices but rather the world and how much oil we need to utilize.

7929 2018-04-29 20:44:02 yuuuup, luckily i got it fixed but metal came out with it and now i have to get my oil changed more often than i was before

7937 2018-04-29 20:42:59 Essential oils shouldn't be applied directly to skin. Always dilute with carrier oil. Essential oils are very concentrated.
7938 2018-04-29 20:42:53 Your are talking about crude oil, right? 
7939 2018-04-29 20:42:51 The US LOOP is a light oil system that in no way competes with Alberta's heavy oil. You need to read a bit more before commenting.
7940 2018-04-29 20:42:39 Saudi Royals are starting a political power game as their Oil reserves decline. The lightly reported war in Yemen is the start of it. Saudi/Israeli pact against Iran could be next.

7944 2018-04-29 20:41:31 My “carpet slippers” are a £100 pair of running shoes I bought specifically to be slippers, but I’ve spent the day in a pair of jeans that are 40% frayed hole and 5% engine oil. I do not make sense.

7948 2018-04-29 20:41:00 1972 oil was $8. What odds would you geniuses have put on $40 within 8 years? My money on @AndurandPierre as a better handicapper.
7949 2018-04-29 20:40:59 1. I wouldn’t call it socialism either, and much less “perfect”. It is true, and unfortunate that Chávez took control of the main means of production (oil) in #VZLA, but social ideals were very early put aside and corruption instead rapidly spread like cancer across all fields
7950 2018-04-29 20:40:38 What is a Miya!? Is that a new cooking oil brand?
7951 2018-04-29 20:40:37 Trump lies ALL the time. (Well documented FACT.) 

Sanders repeats his lies. ALL THE TIME. She considers that her job. 
She comes from a very corrupt family of liars. She has never known integrity and honesty her whole life. Hard to grow up that way.

7955 2018-04-29 20:40:22 You’re lucky because most probably a manager of an equity fund holding oil company stocks has nominated you to receive 70% of the wealth after the owner of the fund died. All you need to do is to transfer USD 200 to the fund manager to make the transfer possible.
7956 2018-04-29 20:40:12 I think it’s more than 50%, they probably think your talking about oil
7957 2018-04-29 20:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？

7960 2018-04-29 20:39:21 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
7961 2018-04-29 20:39:16 I know you'll say this is impossible but it happened. Bought two 4.4 castrol synthetic jugs of oil one 5w-20 the other 0w-20 changed the oil in one two days ago. Just went to change the 0w-20 opened it and it was a jug of black used oil. I bought it form @CanadianTire #beware

7966 2018-04-29 20:38:14 Dagnabbit, #Braves !  You guys aren't even letting me get my oil dirty between all these high scoring games ! :-D
7967 2018-04-29 20:38:11 There are a refreshing few areas the bulldozers have missed. No doubt someone in an office somewhere is plotting to turn it into a yard full of oil barrels and machine parts.
7968 2018-04-29 20:38:09 Also promises to replace ndp carbon tax with carbon levy (tax) on big polluters (oil, gas, agriculture) which will be passed on to consumers. (Albertans) But all carbon levy $ (tax) will go to the tech industry (corporate welfare). No rebates for low income folks in Kenneys AB.
7969 2018-04-29 20:38:00 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7970 2018-04-29 20:37:43 Oil pumpinggggg
7971 2018-04-29 20:37:40 Interesting how oil prices have increased by 11.9% since January 2018 and gas prices have increased by 14.8% (not including the cost of chemicals added to fuel during the warmer months) over the same time period. Could the industry be punishing us for Trans Mountain?
7972 2018-04-29 20:37:23 I coulda sworn I wore it last when we went to go get an oil change lol

7978 2018-04-29 20:36:45 I hate watching product reviews and they just disregard the instructions. “Oh it says use an oil but I’m just gonna use what I want instead” ... 

“Omg it DOESNT WORK FOR ME! Don’t buy!” 

Well of course it doesn’t work. You didn’t follow instructions. 
7979 2018-04-29 20:36:36 Good place for the next proxy war. China manages many of S. Sudan's oil fields!

7991 2018-04-29 20:35:15 And they have been ever since then. Oh how the rock heads on my dorm floor HATED the 1st l.p. when it first came out. But we had to respond to everyone else blasting out that horrid Stones disco album. Freshman year, Fall'78. Good times. Now excuse me plz, I have to oil my walker
7992 2018-04-29 20:35:10 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7993 2018-04-29 20:34:30 Ignore this Kushingoro economics about states that can’t survive without federal allocation. Nigeria as a whole depends on sharing of oil revenue (aka federal allocation). It’s therefore an oxymoron to talk about states not surviving without federal allocation.
7994 2018-04-29 20:34:24 I love them! And you can make your own oil mix. I have oils all around this house lmao.
7995 2018-04-29 20:34:14 You looked and acted like a big goofball, a big orange goofball. I can’t wait until your base realizes what a snake oil salesman you are. You were playing them.
7996 2018-04-29 20:34:05 I got oil in my eyes and it burned
7997 2018-04-29 20:34:04 Are you so brain damaged that you actually posted those items and didn’t think any of them through?
China is on board because of Trump. Sanctions by the world are because of Trump. Economy is in final collapse because US found China cheating on Oil shipments so China quit. And on
7998 2018-04-29 20:34:03 Saudis used to go around Muslim world begging for funds until Oil was discovered. But now they are working against the Muslim interest. Time is round the corner. They were never in debt but now they are paying interest to the very countries who wanted Muslim countries destroyed.
7999 2018-04-29 20:33:54 GENUINE question. Does Vaping oil work in seuthe smoke generators? They seem to be very smoky and I would prefer to smell blackcurrant flavour than smoke oil!! Lol.

8011 2018-04-29 20:30:07 For some reason today I had a profoundly epiphanic moment when I was hungover and at a McDonald’s in Oshawa when I realized, surrounded by screaming kids and hot fryer oil, that I’m honestly living my Best Life and don’t know how I arrived at this conclusion but I know its truth.
8012 2018-04-29 20:30:02 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
8013 2018-04-29 20:29:57 You are an incredible woman @StormyDaniels, the best about you, is that oil that covers you from head to toes, making possible that all of these low lives talking shit about who is ruining the country, slide out and fall off of you face down into the ground. #basta

8020 2018-04-29 20:29:07 Some of the factors affecting our economy are out of the provincial government's control. Someone in this discussion earlier alluded to the collapse in potash prices. Consistently low oil prices have been an issue too, and now that they're high, we're having trouble moving it.
8021 2018-04-29 20:29:04 1-is a #scam 2-anyone can make a similar Token in Nem or Ethereum 3- it's not backed by Oil (nobody can trade it for Oil ) 4-best case scenario: it Will be a token for internal paiments. 5- it's premined.  #elpetro #scam

8024 2018-04-29 20:28:58 Frenchie isolated the issue.  We have been depleting reserves faster than replenishing for what 1-2 decades now I forget.  We take this tight oil non major field investing ideal into 2020’s and forget it.  Actually it’s already too late.
8025 2018-04-29 20:28:40 A shower, feeling fresh, coconut oil on my face and skin , gonna soak up the sun rays. Life is good. Self care Sunday. Get wit it
8026 2018-04-29 20:28:34 It looks great! I’ve always wanted to make an olive oil cake. I’ve never even tasted one. Not sure I’d know if I even made it right.
8027 2018-04-29 20:27:55 Yes I don’t know where they sell anything so y’all please tell me where I can find coconut oil here
8028 2018-04-29 20:27:50 Gabe must have applied a little coconut  oil to that butt. Or more likely that cat is hammered drunk.

maybe, can't tell where tho (should hurt, it's sugar and oil, but the part of my brain responsible for feeling pain is apparently on vacation)

8047 2018-04-29 20:25:06 Paid $130 for oil filter for NH TG215. First one I bought was $60 and just kept going up. They claim it's a 300hr filter. Bought a Wix for $83. Still stupid expensive.

8050 2018-04-29 20:24:43 Correct, they’ll sell oil so you could make your own but you won’t be able to buy pot brownies or cannibis gummy bears off the shelf

8053 2018-04-29 20:24:11 Going to give acrylics a go. I think they'll suit the subject quite well as I can use oil painting technique. Kieth Rocco style. Nice loose brushstrokes. If I was doing a uniform study then I'd use watercolour I think.
8054 2018-04-29 20:23:49 For reasons that I am oblivious to, I have a new follower who is offering me 10% off beard oil or beard comb. Can someone please pass me the Gillette?
8055 2018-04-29 20:23:31 Oil isn't the answer alone, yet that's literally the only leg conservatives, and their staunch supporters, seem to stand on.

Oh, and systematic discrimination against anyone not hetero-white*.

8057 2018-04-29 20:23:09 I don’t know about the argument today, BUT interestingly, early Casoc geologists explored Qatar peninsula for oil under concession between Casoc & King Ibn Saud. (Barger specifically mentioned it in letter it his wife in 1938)
8058 2018-04-29 20:23:08 NOOOO!!! It most definitely IS one of the prettiest areas in the state of Nevada. Worst idea ever to allow oil and gas development in the Rubys!

8076 2018-04-29 20:20:03 Michael, I don’t see it just that way. If you follow the money it all leads to the oil. Muslems in Middle East are distributed through out the world. UN is run by them they have infiltrated all governments. My imagination scares me, so I’ll let you take it from there.
8077 2018-04-29 20:19:59 Oil money took over 
8078 2018-04-29 20:19:53 That doesn't affect the price it sells for on the open market.

It may affect profit margins but not market prices.

A product like a car is not the same as a commodity like oil.

8096 2018-04-29 20:17:52 Our yummy lip scrubs are formulated with castor sugar and jojoba oil making them totally edible. So, you lick it off without guilt!

8098 2018-04-29 20:17:47 I changed my oil and did a couple things on my car I've been meaning to for like ever so I'm feeling pretty productive today
8099 2018-04-29 20:17:43 It’s called cupping. Helps bring the oil and other fluid out of the muscles.
8100 2018-04-29 20:17:39 74.39 Brent Oil. Kjekt at partier med velgermasse på det sentrale austland enno ikkje har klart å ta arbeidet frå oss.
8101 2018-04-29 20:17:39 Jajaja re si jajajaj
8102 2018-04-29 20:17:25 Fan should not slow down when slowing, mine is on a 415 with much less oil flow than 724. I have fan spool set as priority and run engine revs at 1800 to have enough oil flow the lift/lower coulters reasonably quickly.
8103 2018-04-29 20:17:01 “US forces have established a strong presence in eastern Syria, where much of the country's oil and gas reserves are located.” #lol

8105 2018-04-29 20:16:46 Need to buy a fire extinguisher pronto. Too many close calls in the blacksmith. Plastic, wood, paper, oil and spray cans, boxes everywhere. Lost a tiny red hot pellet today, flew in to a box with motor oil and spray cans. Absolutely lethal. ://////
8106 2018-04-29 20:16:38 Looks like an oil painting ! Beautiful !

8112 2018-04-29 20:14:17 Ramp butter, oil, pesto or just freeze them
8113 2018-04-29 20:13:58 The more I read about oil, the more I realize how much potential we're giving up by digging it up and shipping it our.  Thar's gold in that thar sludge!  We just have to process it in Canada to get the most value from it.
8114 2018-04-29 20:13:17 You are dreaming that a pert and brilliant messy-haired auburn ESFP oil heiress, flipping her long and silky tresses over a wisteria blue beret, makes an earth offering to Hnoss under the watchful eyes of a knowingly phenomenal palomino Shire horse.
8115 2018-04-29 20:13:14 Really? His nukes are why we have not invaded? How about that it's next door to China? What do they have that US monied interests want? They don't have oil. Maybe mining tho. Worth a war?
8116 2018-04-29 20:13:04 ... cast iron fryingpan filled with hot cooking oil...
8117 2018-04-29 20:12:55 I hope you are setting aside some funds to retrain some workers in the coal mining and oil drilling industries. 
Not like US Steel and International Harvester who abandoned the coal miners of South Eastern Kentucky. And left a poverty stricken landscape.
Go see Lynch, Benham, KY
8118 2018-04-29 20:12:47 bumpy little corn in my family keeps using oil in the bathtub one day im gonna take the fattest nap the next chance i get
8119 2018-04-29 20:12:45 Why ship away any more of our oil of any kind we need to process it here in Canada it irks me in the deepest part of my person to be paying $1.62 a leader which is over seven dollars a gallon come on you political people
8120 2018-04-29 20:12:27 Wow gorgeous pic.....looks like an oil painting
8121 2018-04-29 20:12:23 In the previous match, @IndyEleven KO'd @yennek_reklaw. Is Indy 11 planning on doing this again? 

Clearly, they scouted well... Kenny showed what he's capable of in Ottawa. A leg that powerful hasn't been in Lucas Oil Stadium since @PatMcAfeeShow.
8122 2018-04-29 20:11:53 Mamá me preguntó porque llegué más temprano de lo normal y le tuve que decir que fue porque estaba media pasada pero en realidad si no me sacaban mis amigas ayer yo seguía bailando hasta ahora en fuel oil y mandándome cagadas 
8123 2018-04-29 20:11:46 He's taking a page out of Jim Comey's playbook: Lie and misdirect. "The Godfather gets his money selling olive oil".
8124 2018-04-29 20:11:45 Oil imported to Canada is not subjected to the same rules and regulations as our oil is. Would you have the same view if we could import cars cheaper but these cars were not subject to the same safety and emissions standards as cars produced here?
8125 2018-04-29 20:11:42 My dad took my car to get an oil change AND he put gas and new blades for my windshield wipers on and YES I’m crying.
8126 2018-04-29 20:11:41 They shot 90 missiles, non of them reached its target. They can even pass the borders. So yeah they can’t even dream of hitting KSA let alone hitting oil facilities.
8127 2018-04-29 20:11:30 Oil is heading back up. Calgary and Edmonton will come around. Alberta  will be the center of Canada very soon once again!

8129 2018-04-29 20:11:21 The guy in Flint who is in charge and caused the problem

Is the same guy who cancelled the water bottles and the water is still polluted 

Yup, that guy is a GREEDY REPUBLICAN

He has probably used lots of the $50 million for himself

That's an "R" trait
8130 2018-04-29 20:11:21 You problee shave down the calve, oil er up and wear capris for the off chance of a good lipstick lunge from buddies goldy.
8131 2018-04-29 20:11:18 Ok, I use foam wrap first and basically mold my hair into whatever direction I want it to go in, put a scarf on, blow dry & then add some oil and flat iron it w/ a comb and it’s gone be sooo silky. I promise! I have 4C too.
8132 2018-04-29 20:11:12 Lads. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a absolute dickfest. I can't come to poker tonight.
8133 2018-04-29 20:11:08 That's true. A group of fucking nutritionists decided they were bad a couple decades back, and doctors kept restricting them for people with cholesterol or some such problems. Now, everyone's like: let's do ghee, coconut oil, millets!! Like they came up with it first
8134 2018-04-29 20:10:41 El presente esta en el litio, atómica, mareomotriz. Al oil le quedan 50-pirulos. El futuro es el hidrógeno.
8135 2018-04-29 20:10:34 Peppermint oil tablets are my new best mates
8136 2018-04-29 20:10:33 Oh yeah. It's great. Coal ash flowing, dirty air, dirty oil filled oceans, less access to medical, divisive racist language, corruption on a grand scale, porn stars, developing/enabling plutocracy and on and on. You don't want this. Australia is already great.
8137 2018-04-29 20:10:21 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
8138 2018-04-29 20:10:20 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
8139 2018-04-29 20:10:20 It’s still not at 3 % , because of a unstable stock market , and future tariffs. Oil is over $ 60.00 a barrel, this alone will derail the market .           $3.00 a gallon, and $4.00 in California. This causes a domino effect.
8140 2018-04-29 20:10:16 She's referring to the oil company itself, not us.

She's complimenting us. She should clear that up.

8146 2018-04-29 20:09:43 Marge always gives a lighter bake ( same as using oil ) 
8147 2018-04-29 20:09:42 It was neither about control (US/Coalition forces left, too soon in fact) nor about oil (US pumped in billions, took out not one penny). It was about regime change, preemptive defense and Sadaam's abuses, as stated all along.
Sometimes the stated truth is also the actual truth.

8157 2018-04-29 20:07:11 I like them because in 2013, I was given months to live stage 4 cancer. Chemo had not worked in 2011 so I tried cannabis oil. Not only am I alive, I am cancer free and the oil should be legally available,  this policy is only enriching drug dealers
8158 2018-04-29 20:07:09 Yep
I picked up a few. Spent some time in and oura there. Going back one day to catch some steelheads. Was in cleveland about 16 months ago. At the VA. Worked all over it buying right of way for those oil companies a few years back.
8159 2018-04-29 20:07:06 @DrGundry I am so confused!  In The Plant Paradox you said Olive Oil is ok in phase 1 but in the cookbook you said to avoid it for phase 1 and 2 week of phase 2.  I didn't avoid it in phase 1, should I start over?

8161 2018-04-29 20:06:41 It is CBD oil that is pain relieving. It doesn't work right away. Smoking a joint is not anything like CBD oil. My cannabis doctor advised 3 months of daily CBD oil is needed to see if it helps. I get great results. Not a cure but manages my dystonia.

8166 2018-04-29 20:06:11 i burned my skin off with tea tree oil. how’s your sunday going?
8167 2018-04-29 20:05:58 Less popular opinion: Kuwait was wrong to take Iraq's oil, and, intentionally or not, Bush 1's administration gave Saddam the green light to invade.
8168 2018-04-29 20:05:54 What’s happened to @TGIFridays ?..My wife’s potato skins turned up burnt (only for the waitress to tell her ‘it’s like that it’s the oil’ & a different waitress dropped the top off Daughters burger on an unclean table only to pick it up and slap it back on top won’t be going back

8170 2018-04-29 20:05:50 Vitamin E oil is the perfect moisturizer. No it doesn’t make you break out and no it doesn’t make you extra oily if you’re already oily. Not only is it good for your skin (anti-aging) but it gives such a nice glow!

8172 2018-04-29 20:04:56 Greg, I know you are an intelligent person. None of this makes sense. I have read so many articles from the left that insist that bitumen has no future with nothing to substantiate their claims. Yet oil producers are buying land at bargain prices for future production. Why?

8175 2018-04-29 20:03:54 My favorite customers are those who come into Alex and Ani asking if we were an olive oil store almost TWO YEARS AGO
8176 2018-04-29 20:03:52 Love whole slices (thinly cut), olive oil and roasted garlic as a first layer instead of sauce.
8177 2018-04-29 20:03:42 It wouldn’t kill higher end hotels to leave small bottles of something like coconut oil in each room. It’s not that expensive and likely of some general use for everyone as well as being considerate to non white guests.
8178 2018-04-29 20:03:40 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
8179 2018-04-29 20:03:31 Today’s service = fresh fire and fresh oil for the next level
8180 2018-04-29 20:03:05 Ooh. That sounds nice! Oil has a movement to it that doesn't completely dry out in a session making it easy to blend out and build upon afterwards (after waiting). It can be thinned out like watercolor tho. Does gouache dry kinda quick like acrylic and watercolor can?
8181 2018-04-29 20:03:04 Doubt It,but I bet she and others will be burning the midnight oil discussing how to spin It in her favour.IMO If Rudd does go then so will Thresa the Eton boys will make sure of that.
8182 2018-04-29 20:03:02 First real @amazon screwup. I ordered notebooks and essential oil and received 3 Boston Terrier Brewing Company posters. Interesting substitution.
8183 2018-04-29 20:02:39 Agriculture is a permanent oil and an important economic and livelihood resource
If we compare it with China and some countries whose economy relies on agricultural resources as well as industry and mining
8184 2018-04-29 20:02:37 So a bunch of liberals were at a party hosted by a company that objectifies women? Hmmm.

8186 2018-04-29 20:02:24 Epic fail! The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to save the economy from collapsing even further. Also oil prices hit lows thanks to fracking. Obama's legacy? Worst GDP in history.
8187 2018-04-29 20:02:07 Thouse idiots does not understand that USA has spent more money in Irak and Syria than it can earn from the oil...

It is more about to isolate China, Rusia and Iran economicaly..

8192 2018-04-29 20:01:37 There's a South Park episode around the BP oil spill which shows Tony Hayward having to make repeated insincere PR apologies. Kind of feels like that with Amber Rudd.

8222 2018-04-29 19:58:34 OK, but I'm not talking about the vegan part, I'm talking about the demand part. The dinosaur connection is irrelevant; oil extraction, production, and refining, are harmful to animals on a macroscale, for which you are creating demand; further demand exists regardless at macro.

8224 2018-04-29 19:58:29 And leaking oil
8225 2018-04-29 19:58:06 B. NM's coupling of healthcare funding with oil revenues is a matter of NM policy, not a force of nature. They can fix it anytime, and should, if they honor their responsibility to protecting the safety of their citizens. So, my point stands.

8228 2018-04-29 19:57:52 my new snack obsession boasts that they have "Ony 4 Ingredients"  
Too bad they're Starch, Oil, Sugar, & Salt
8229 2018-04-29 19:57:47 My 85 yr old mom uses the CBD oil for her chronic pain, she can't take opiates because she's allergic. The oil has been a life saver. I'm a firm believer in it.
8230 2018-04-29 19:57:28 They keep threatening to oust #TheresaMay so why don’t they?  Because they know there is no stomach in the HoC for the hard Brexit these snake oil salesmen have sold to the  country. They would hate to have real power because then who would they blame?  #fbpe #PeoplesVote
8231 2018-04-29 19:57:23 Oil change 
8232 2018-04-29 19:57:21 On the subject of fake tan. I am trying a new dry oil spray one from Superdrug which I applied with a tan roller. Its the way forward. Much easier and faster application. Hope this tan works better than the last one I have been using.
8233 2018-04-29 19:57:16 And guess the religion of those folks who commanded the invasion of oil rich Venezuela, Libya, Iraq and Syria? Haha.

Hopefully, you're now one step closer to understanding your part of the world has been getting fucked by jews while you sing kumbaya, rejoice and hate on Russians
8234 2018-04-29 19:57:08 I need to get an oil change and wash my car 
8235 2018-04-29 19:56:57 Not sure why @Pupsky had macadamia oil in his bathroom but it did well as a make-up remover, and that's my pro tip for the day
8236 2018-04-29 19:56:53 Jetpack technology exists, but the reptiles hoard it for themselves!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

8239 2018-04-29 19:56:29 *My* country provided oil refinery equipment to Syria and taught otherwise uneducated Syrians how to use it. For a percentage of the refined oil, we have blessed Syria with development. The US, on the other hand, attempted to steal oil from Syria and use it as a transport hub.
8240 2018-04-29 19:56:27 Verb ghost oil is really light weight and works well on wet or dry hair. Helps with friziness and dryness!
8241 2018-04-29 19:56:08 Thanks again Tim JONES Oil and Gas for the update
8242 2018-04-29 19:56:05 So I forgot to change the oil in my car and now we have to do it in some small town  #ayleslie

8244 2018-04-29 19:55:57 Damascus was once an oasis of fields fruit trees and crops in a beautiful landscape for over two million people who lived a peaceful life. 

Was. Until they found oil and the American monsters saw it and grinned and rubbed their wicked hands together.
8245 2018-04-29 19:55:40 Just wait until the US discovers oil in North Korea
8246 2018-04-29 19:55:38 Wisdom tooth coming through, clove oil is a saviour, but I smell like Christmas/ orange pomander ball

8250 2018-04-29 19:55:25 I was only able to clean the kitchen and mop the first floor before we had to head out to look at dishwashers. Maybe next weekend I'll get to change the mower blades and oil, and then tackle the basement.

Because having this hanging over my head is pissing me off right now.

It is actually true that you get Baby Oil from babies. All of the people that tell you different are #FakeNews
8253 2018-04-29 19:55:05 "Prospecting for oil is a dynamic art... The greatest single element in all prospecting, past, present and future, is the man willing to take a chance." -Everett DeGolyer
8254 2018-04-29 19:55:05 @RayHC2 got any answers?  

"Where are the Asian contracts to buy vastly more raw bitumen for decades? What price have they promised to pay? How does that square up with competing, global oil supply rivals? Who has prepared a serious global oil market analysis?"
8255 2018-04-29 19:55:01 The philosophy behind the ECA is that we should not consume all we earn. The ECA helped us survive when oil prices crashed - Festus Keyamo
8256 2018-04-29 19:55:01 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
8257 2018-04-29 19:54:56 WTF did Chucky Collins do when she conducted oil company pricing Inquiry I suggest she did SFA but grandstand and show faux concern <>NO action
National raised petrol excise tax six times in office. Speaking of broken pipeline no one was ever found responsible/charged funny that

8259 2018-04-29 19:54:54 Replaced my whole headlight plus all the bulbs, picked up Bay, put together Bays playhouse & rearranged her room, went grocery shopping, went to work & I'm about to start dinner while Chaze does the oil changes on the cars.
8260 2018-04-29 19:54:52 Somegow this looks kind of like an oil painting
8261 2018-04-29 19:54:42 Yep. It's possible it was the petrol and oil fumes from the 2hp Stuart engine that collected in the bilges too.
8262 2018-04-29 19:53:37 Yeah, I live in the midst of the oil industry- it’s still abundant although most companies have paid off employees & rehired them on zero hours contracts, but that’s Corps for you!

8264 2018-04-29 19:53:24 The HoL should under no circumstances be elected, that would ruin our constitutional checks and balances. A revising chamber needs experts not more mealy mouthed politicians selling snake oil.
8265 2018-04-29 19:53:04 Thank you Margaret I'm learning. I paint actually modern oil painting. I'm still not so much exercise in drawing people
8266 2018-04-29 19:53:02 Tells us Thorp was more of a math guy more than a gambler. Eg. Aristotle story of Greek Philosophers of Thales and olive oil contracts. You make a good point.
8267 2018-04-29 19:52:54 Well I’m currently on the pussy juice lmfaoo but ima get that joba and agon oil 
8268 2018-04-29 19:52:43 Actually, U.S doesnt need syiria's Oil. They have Saudi. That is the EU's interest.
8269 2018-04-29 19:52:24 I realised, a long time ago, that I and romantic relationships go as well as water and oil.

8276 2018-04-29 19:50:49 Wish I could share assessment of a fmr state department attaché here but it’s too long. Basically it would so hard for anyone to incapacitate Aramco’s oil industry through terrorism because it’s so spread out & that the bigger threat would be cutting off Riyadh’s water
8277 2018-04-29 19:50:41 Haha doubt it but it was interesting to see the supply ship which is servicing Saipem drillship next to the oil tanker
8278 2018-04-29 19:50:40 @realDonaldTrump  pls don't shake Buhari's hand due 2 his hands are filled with d blood of d innocent Nigerians he killed  especially Biafrans. If u must shake his hand get prayer warriors 2 pray for u afterward & wash ur hands in blessed olive oil to avoid his curses following u
8279 2018-04-29 19:50:24 Look at it this way. As long as the jihadists control the area, The British Govt can steal as much oil as they can.If Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa control their land the COST changes. REFERENDUM solves the problem.
8280 2018-04-29 19:50:19 USA and the West gave our country to the mollas. Now 40 years later still backing mollas bc. they want our oil and gas. Guess what USA?? Putin having pj. Party in  Iran! NO WONDER THEY LOVE MOLLAS. SHAME ON YOU
8281 2018-04-29 19:50:07 @dickstrawbridge #EscapeToTheChateau is perfect escapism. Brought a tear to my eye watching you convert oil tank to pig spit. Reminded me of my poor Dad who converted a used washingmachine motor to make a chicken plucker, made my dolls house & pram, built family home, etc
8282 2018-04-29 19:50:06 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
8283 2018-04-29 19:49:56 Search for ‘LA Beast Olive Oil’ on YouTube, good luck not throwing up watching it

8289 2018-04-29 19:49:24 This was an interesting article Zylie. Especially the comments on CBD oil.
8290 2018-04-29 19:49:21 Dan it goes to show when the greedy oil companies get greedy all they are doing is hurting themselves as it shows we are heading to Blaine to fill up. Think of the lost business up here! Global TV interviewed people in the border line up & they are willing to wait in the line ups

8296 2018-04-29 19:48:14 Who’s really thinking that Trump wishes Nigeria well. Trump can only criticise Buhari If he does anything that affects Nigeria’s oil flowing to USA. If the change APC promised is contrary to PMB’s performance, Nigerians shld sack him.  #Use ur vote wisely. Vote out any bad govt.
8297 2018-04-29 19:48:09 Thanks. It’s the cost outlay that worries me. I worry I’ll have spent quite a bit and still be stuck with them. I did some prints of oil landscapes a few yrs ago - still got some.
8298 2018-04-29 19:48:06 trying out the Mane Choice hair pills and oil. hopefully it works 
8299 2018-04-29 19:47:39 I am painting in oil, a portrait of a man

8300 2018-04-29 19:47:24 The only common interests are oil and keeping Iran under their boots.
8301 2018-04-29 19:47:20 why tf is my car drinking so much oil 
8302 2018-04-29 19:47:20 $550 just for that alone plus 2 front tires $225 plus front brake work $250 plus a transmission oil leak I been had. No I'm not about to invest $1500-2000 in a car that has 172k miles on it and is 14 years old. That'd be ridiculous.

8308 2018-04-29 19:46:24 I dip my finger in olive oil then dip it in sugar
8309 2018-04-29 19:46:22 Thank the Lord for BIO oil. 
8310 2018-04-29 19:46:10 Then drop it. Iran is using conventional warfare to expand its influence. They don't need nukes with friends like Russia in the region. Oil is what's driving Macron as previously stated.
8311 2018-04-29 19:46:09 maybe he's speaking from arresting decline rather than growth phase we envisage.... 
opportunities exist, everyone is watching but the real issues impacting FAAC seems deeper!
In oil, chasing the next barrel more difficult than your first! Brownfield development philosophy!
8312 2018-04-29 19:45:59 It is the quality Sir. Peugeot Cars requires Total Activa. We dont have it in Nigeria. PAN knows that we dont have it here but the sticker is still on the car. There is no oil for 2012 cars in Nigeria from those oil companies in Nigeria
8313 2018-04-29 19:45:41 Yes. @AndurandPierre claim that demand is inelastic needs to add the temporal dimension. Energy (incl. oil) demand tends to be (very) inelastic in short/medium term, but not so much in the long run.

Sustained +$100 crude would intensify the push for efficiency & electrification.

8330 2018-04-29 19:43:11 I have an irrational fear of burning my place down, so I was nervous to leave my new slow cooker on (while a pot of cold oil was across the room) to go to the gym. So seeing  in my driveway when I got home was  but it was not for me

8334 2018-04-29 19:42:27 Just to clarify, it It says right in there that they're still funding oil sands and will remain engaged in the energy sector. Second and third paragraph of the story.
8335 2018-04-29 19:42:24 About $800 billion to $2 trillion is laundered worldwide every year.
Money laundry is the 3rd largest economic activity in the world after oil and foreign exchange.
8336 2018-04-29 19:42:17 I’m in my 4th year in Saudi Arabia and we are gallo. We are treated like royalty with the salaries they pay us, that’s our primary focus. Asijiki, oil money’s lekker hey.
8337 2018-04-29 19:42:05 Please look into making Shell oil change plans instead of adding more pollution to an already overly saturated polluted airway
8338 2018-04-29 19:41:59 You’ve BENEFITED from a trump policy? Really? How do you feel about clean air and drinkable water? Do you like drilling for oil in national parks? How about allowing poison pesticides that damage kids? Killing endangered species? I hope you enjoy that extra $1.50 in your paycheck

8340 2018-04-29 19:41:51 Not especially! I like Body Shop's overnight Vitamen E mask, but it's more like a night cream tbh. And I like doing an acid/oil/clay combo, and my skin feels super clean, but the glowy effect only lasts minutes really!
8341 2018-04-29 19:41:25 This tattoo is peeling harder than any tat I've had. It hurts so bad and I'm straining EVERYTHING with coconut oil. 

Do I regret anything? No.
8342 2018-04-29 19:41:23 I just wanna know why no one has recommended baby oil sex to me before. 10/10. Sensational.
8343 2018-04-29 19:41:19 It's starting to look like Trudeau is owned by big oil.
8344 2018-04-29 19:41:16 protecting the environment by selling more oil ......   oxymoron    tax Canadians  while  permitting a private company to pollute at a multiple ....
8345 2018-04-29 19:41:13 Not dependent on foreign countries for our oil prices?  Fracking has freed us from the shackles of foreign countries?   If you believe this, you haven’t looked at oil prices at the pump lately and the reasons for their rise.   Russia and other countries still hold sway here!
8346 2018-04-29 19:41:05 Welcome to the world of oil money
8347 2018-04-29 19:41:04 There’s one scene in Ertugrul where he’s combing Halime’s hair and I’m thinking Dave can oil my hair because if he combed it, the knots would be never ending. 
8348 2018-04-29 19:40:57 Absolutely correct. I’m in Tennessee and this is the first I’ve heard of this gathering. Hate groups need attention more than anything. Don’t give it to them

8358 2018-04-29 19:39:16 That is demonstrably not true. Remember the oil sands were initially developed in a world where oil was $30-$40/barrel they can make a tidy profit in a $70/b world of today.
8359 2018-04-29 19:38:54 Oh thanks, I love this suggestion. Will do it with olive oil too. Big fan of EVOO!!
8360 2018-04-29 19:38:54 Another grown man saying oil money city bingo time
8361 2018-04-29 19:38:48 If you actually go 30 on Packard I hope you need a fully synthetic oil change every single month

8365 2018-04-29 19:38:12 @NeilClark66 This is legitimate line of questioning  and U might go to ask if industries like North Seal oil workers are subject to mandatory  dope tests  as are contrast  workers for Call Centres in Banks .U might ask why are not News International employees & Management subject
8366 2018-04-29 19:38:07 Millions of years from now Lagos will be the centre of crude oil. Waste plenty for here. Mushin might be the next Niger delta
8367 2018-04-29 19:38:03 Standard and legal way? Laughs. Is gas flaring "standard"? Is it "legal" to award oil blocs to individuals?

Artisanal Refineries arose out of SEVERE economic deprivation and is being sustained by Supply Gaps in the Petroleum Downstream sector. Offshoots of a dysfunctional system

8371 2018-04-29 19:37:30 Pretty sure it got down to like 2 dollars deff remember it being 1.98 at express mart  I’m just sayin u r blaming the wrong person n bush had gas prices high af without an oil spill but no  one ever wants to mention that either  it’s rlly all good tho bby 
8372 2018-04-29 19:37:30 It’s too cold for oil paints outside so I thought I’d do *just a little study* inside, and instead spilled turpentine so now every window is open and it smells like poison anyway 
8373 2018-04-29 19:37:27 The whole? Jesus, you're so blinkered it's unreal. By that reckoning, the whole of Scotland voted for indy because "it's oor oil!".
8374 2018-04-29 19:37:27 Though,after my 1st,not a mark,but the2nd...left his mark!I think fate has the bigger hand over moisturiser!
My2nd is now mid teens&has grown so fast he's got stretch marks across his back!

8375 2018-04-29 19:37:21 @WSJ "The world's biggest oil companies are awash in cash...". So I wonder why U.S. oil companies still need welfare/subsidies from the federal government?
8376 2018-04-29 19:36:45 I used a body scrub that had olive oil in it and then it wouldnt wash off no matter what i tried so i had do use dish soap on my fucking body to get it off anyways hows your night going

8380 2018-04-29 19:36:21 hahaah.. ah..the flatbed journey.. :)
I only had one real biggie on a track day.. came in hot, on the inside on the first turn, held my line ok, but bloke in front popped oil... I hit it..and took out the 2 guys to my right, who then took out another 3 behind them...
8381 2018-04-29 19:36:04 all of oil
8382 2018-04-29 19:36:02 Very.
8383 2018-04-29 19:35:52 @oil_shaeikh you that was angry when you got posted to kwara
8384 2018-04-29 19:35:38 Ditto. I'll take a candle, soap, oil, and lotion. But nothing edible

8386 2018-04-29 19:35:21 Wow, truly shocking that International Atomic Energy Association finds ... wait for it... atomic energy is the greatest shit on Earth.

What next an article by Exxon on how good for environment oil spills and burning fossil fuels are?

You are tedious. Go away.
8387 2018-04-29 19:35:10 True! Legislation all the way back to Deregulation Of Media Ownership, Banks etc has been w/Koch's $$ behind them, Heritage, all of them are Koch Oil. Koch's ran for Pres. on anti Soc. Sec., anti anything for people, but more tax cuts for 1%, back to 1850 when white men ruled.
8388 2018-04-29 19:34:54 Give her your most prized possession (but cover it in coconut oil first, they love that shit)

8395 2018-04-29 19:33:56 We would be glad to have you! It would be fantastic for our young people to hear your story. Private message me and I will get your contact details 
8396 2018-04-29 19:33:51 We shoul bank our oil so that future generations can have the security of knowing there are energy options and if it's ever needed we will have much much better ways of using it than we do now. But I digress we'll never actually need it...

8405 2018-04-29 19:33:08 My kids are my life and I will do anything for them. I started all of this bc of HER not me. I am a cannabis advocate, helped legalize CBD oil here and fight every day for her future. This is America, it shouldn't be this way. 
8406 2018-04-29 19:33:07 ENIC decided to spend less on a new stadium, and a leading training facility, than the oil men did on their squad.

No one will compete with that, Levy knows it, Poch knows it and last week Jose and Zidane said it.

8409 2018-04-29 19:32:41 Castor oil also works! Especially for hairline
8410 2018-04-29 19:32:39 Interesting factor here: can anyone even say for sure what Trump's policy is anymore? If ever there's been a lick-finger-feel-wind decision-maker, it's our current president. And his decision-making is so perilously tied to his pride. Trump runs on flattery, rage, & fryer oil.
8411 2018-04-29 19:32:29 
8412 2018-04-29 19:32:28 "Zero emission"? Not if the electricity is generated by burning coal, oil or gas. Depending on the relative efficiency,  the emissions of these "zero emission" buses might actually be higher than conventional ones..
8413 2018-04-29 19:32:26 Burned my hand with hot oil so I guess I'm done cooking for awhile. Anyone wanna go to Denny's?
8414 2018-04-29 19:32:18 I’m not talking about rescinding previous pledges—I agree that would be dishonorable.  I’m talking about oil & gas related alumni & businesses that are completely justified in withholding future support. Actions have consequences, and a drop in financial support may well be one.

8416 2018-04-29 19:31:56 In Spain is well known that Italian brands buy olive cheap oil here (and in other countries) and they resell it more expensive for export as "Made in Italy"
There's also the rumor (urban legend?) that Spanish companies that tried to sell oil directly in the USA were threatened
8417 2018-04-29 19:31:50 Why? I would imagine that more shale production --> lower oil price
8418 2018-04-29 19:31:35 Saudis have never respected Blacks... Ever! I wonder why America keeps on supporting the tyrannical rule - selling arms to Saudis, arms used to kill Yemenis. But again, its all about interests..... OIL. #SlaveryInTheGulf
8419 2018-04-29 19:31:28 Very
8420 2018-04-29 19:31:03 even if we get our product to market via pipelines no one will buy it at the cost it requires to make profits because there is cheaper alternative more easily accessible thanks to the Gulf states, and countries. The only answer for Alberta is to get OFF oil.

8432 2018-04-29 19:30:01 To borrow the alliteration of the loony left commenter.. Sooner than later, ridiculous right'ers will realize that hinging all their bets on pipelines is a losing strategy. Alberta oil is more expensive to refine and reproduce. Alberta oil cannot compete with the US LOOP highway.
8433 2018-04-29 19:29:59 A sort of Portuguese chorizo, on a skewer over a dish of oil that they set alight. It's amazing.

If a place of worship is what he deemed fit for the state, then let his honourably resign, and with his feelings too!

Mike Huckabee's Salary. Mike Huckabee  has an estimated net worth of $9 million dollars.
8447 2018-04-29 19:27:25 I thought she was hysterical.  What’s the matter, can’t take a joke? Ha!  “Looking for foreign oil in @DonaldJTrumpJr ‘s hair.”
8448 2018-04-29 19:27:18 Its for medical and scientific purposes and not for recreational. Pple are confusing the two. The oil is used for cancer treatment. Just google medical uses of mbanje

8451 2018-04-29 19:26:56 “Any entity transporting oil through BC shall post a bond equal to the full cost of economic damage and cleanup for a worst-case spill. In the event any spill occurs and such a bond was not posted, the entity shall be liable for treble damages.” Seems enforceable to me.
8452 2018-04-29 19:26:50 law enforcement is doing nothing 2 stop it.

You're FIRED! Set the damn wall on fire with oil. To hell with environment, what do you think the illegals are doing to the environment? Rhetorical question.
8453 2018-04-29 19:25:52 Anglo Zionist pirates trying to steal Syrian oil wealth using SDF.

8461 2018-04-29 19:24:32 A good dose of castor oil would help too!
8462 2018-04-29 19:24:31 It’s more mechanical because you’ve got the oil smell you get from an old car, but without the leather that usually comes with it. HMS Belfast was similar...
8463 2018-04-29 19:24:29 Ehm the SNP based the entire set up of a country, in the White Paper, predicated on an over inflated oil price and expected everyone to believe them. Then when found out 'och it was just a bonus ken' #shystets
8464 2018-04-29 19:24:26 Two types air and oil 
8465 2018-04-29 19:24:21 It will be built and no she will not receive credit because she doesn't deserve it. She 'may' receive 'some' credit for her half hearted attempts to correct the damage done by her #NDP anti oil zelots as the previous opposition and now as government. Other than that Good riddance
8466 2018-04-29 19:23:59 You know that you've truly become a study abroad student when you start saying things like "It's time to drink my olive oil again"
8467 2018-04-29 19:23:49 Gosh, that looks good. Pork recipe very simple, actually. Dry pork skin (kitchen roll followed by salt for an hour). Rub flesh with mixture of crushed fennel, garlic, olive oil...

8471 2018-04-29 19:23:28 It seems all the OPEC countries are once again fixing the oil prices so they can pay for all the bombs they purchase to slaughter the people of Yemen and Syria

8473 2018-04-29 19:23:21 Ya no I get what ur saying but I’m saying that obama didn’t spill the oil and create a massive gas shortage that raised the gas prices for so long - BP did

8482 2018-04-29 19:22:43 Time to fire or recall these poorly run governments that line there pocket with our taxes increase there salary without the citizens approval, hike up taxes whenever they want. Cooperate with the oil companies increasing there profits and banks increasing there profits.
8483 2018-04-29 19:22:38 What do you want, haven't you stolen enough oil already?
8484 2018-04-29 19:22:29 Coconut oil is literally great for everything!
Acne/breakouts? Use coconut oil!
Stretch marks? Use coconut oil!
Damaged hair? Use coconut oil!
Mental breakdown? Use coconut oil!
8485 2018-04-29 19:22:27 Used Avon oil spray on hol to keep mozzies off. Dreamt the woman cleaning my room slipped on the oil and we found her body in the shower. Instead of telling anyone, I hid the body and scrubbed the room so no one would blame me. Really hoping this isn't what I would actually do!

8493 2018-04-29 19:21:04 I’ve never painted with oil but! imo they’re somewhere between aquarelles and acrylics!

8495 2018-04-29 19:20:48 Also, bots have both energon and coolant lines, oil circulates in both. Coolant lines are deeper so only bleed in case of serious injury.

8498 2018-04-29 19:20:09 Lmao. Lucky win against our B team. I didn't know you'd brag about that too.
Next season... If you repeat this 'win'... Lemme cry oil.
8499 2018-04-29 19:20:03 1. Cut off oil to BC  2. Build pipeline through US or the Territories  3. The Nation of Alberta

8501 2018-04-29 19:19:38 The original one is tomato sauce, oregano, garlic, olive oil and anchovies. But nowadays anchovies are not so common anymore.
8502 2018-04-29 19:19:32 Water and oil don't mix.
8503 2018-04-29 19:19:32 Best service I ever get is at the five minute oil change place on Claiborne. Do recommend
8504 2018-04-29 19:19:13 Guy was suppose to start at 12 I call him at 12:15 and he says he’s at his house putting oil in his car because it got messed up when he ran oout gas trying to get here two weeks ago
8505 2018-04-29 19:19:12 ...ND govs and elites need to I) increase local ownership of oil rights - only thing NASS members need to harp on endlessly. 2) Diverisfy local economy into agriculture and services - become import subsitiution capital of Nigeria 3) Start saving for the future

robot pee is made up of used coolant, processed energon and waste oil. It’s a faint pinky brown. It glows very slightly.

8511 2018-04-29 19:18:33 Wet sanded to 2000 grit, now I need to figure out what finish to use.  I think I want oil first and then eventually a gloss like lacquer or something.

8513 2018-04-29 19:18:23 I am sure you know very well that inflation lags. Whether you accept it or not, Ted injected a huge dose of inflation into the economy with his 'Dash for Growth' was stiched up by OPEC.  Oil price went through the roof. The inflation hit under Wilson, who managed to get it down.
8514 2018-04-29 19:18:18 It’s lazy syntax: we’ll be *flying* to a destination, not “servicing” it like an oil change or a blowjob.
8515 2018-04-29 19:18:06 AGAIN WITH THE PRUNES! Also, it looks like an oil spill.
8516 2018-04-29 19:18:04 I love the Trader Joe’s oil cleanser! The first time I used it, later the same day I caught half a glimpse of myself in the mirror of a grimy basement bathroom and did a double take bc of how glowy my skin looked.
8517 2018-04-29 19:18:00 I love the hypocrisy of critics like you. When the economy contracts it's because of the FG under PMB and not falling oil price, when those same oil prices rise, u claim it's base effects. Why not stick to one narrative
8518 2018-04-29 19:17:58 One may conclude that OIL is a primary objective rather than the eradication of dictators as claimed

Particularly when similar atrocities that occur in countries such as Rwanda & Myanmar fail to mobilise USA, UK troops to bring about democracy
8519 2018-04-29 19:17:56 @ChadPawson your intersting story on religious protesters at Kinder Morgan did not say their reasons for protesting pipeline. Is it that they do not want Canadians or the world to ever use oil products again and so all production and shipment should stop across the world?
8520 2018-04-29 19:17:51 Diet for a small planet, Silent Spring, etc etc. The 70s oil crisis too.
8521 2018-04-29 19:17:49 thank you @parn123

those Cavafy translations are like votive candles, or oil lamps lit within a quiet chapel set apart from the rest of the Quartet, making sense of the larger whole

be well!
8522 2018-04-29 19:17:49 I've heard that using products that are too matte will just make your face produce more excess oil but I don't know if that's 100% true. I know loreal pro matte is pretty good & it's not EXTREMELY matte so maybe that would work?
8523 2018-04-29 19:17:46 I feel like i can’t trust any mechanic at any auto shop. They’re always lying to me about shit I need done. Gtfo all i need is an oil change
8524 2018-04-29 19:17:40 Ah, but we've made it so that they can ship the oil out of our country to markets where they can make more money. Guess who pushed for that rule change.
8525 2018-04-29 19:17:37 Somebody better stop selling that dude fuel oil and fertilizer.
8526 2018-04-29 19:17:36 Guys which oil best for hair?
8527 2018-04-29 19:17:34 Haha! Well let this be a lesson to you - if it does need oil, don’t add too much!!
8528 2018-04-29 19:17:30 I wish someone at the #WHCD would’ve served the CNN table bananas and apples.
8529 2018-04-29 19:17:15 So the fact that refining costs are rising, and my big oil stock is sucking at the moment while my clean energy stocks rise is his fault? So.... you hate clean energy?

8533 2018-04-29 19:16:16 We have discovered enough oil and fossil fuel in America to make Saudi Arabia unnecessary. They shouldn’t be worried but they have had their hooks in our government so long they will find ways to keep us attached
8534 2018-04-29 19:16:04 Damn oil companies.
8535 2018-04-29 19:16:00 Common Bolanle, while we try to make constructive critism of this administration, I'd implore us not to use false information to do so. Even OPEC would find it hard to stabilize oil price globally then, whose PMB? HE NEVER SAID THAT

8539 2018-04-29 19:15:32 Electrifying railroads (worldwide 20% of km are electrified, US < 1%) and shifting freight to rail by ending truck subsidies could reduce US oil demand by @ 2 million b/day.

8545 2018-04-29 19:14:58 Rockefeller talked about this in the late 1800's as well. No one at the time knew if meaningful amounts of oil existed outside Northwestern Pennsylvania.

8548 2018-04-29 19:14:50 Lemme guess, this video was made by the same woman who revolutionized blood tests? 

Snake oil sales are through the roof if you make a catchy commercial on the web.
8549 2018-04-29 19:14:44 Lol! So it's 250B this week, per old Lt. Bonespurs? There was $100B of Iran's own money, payment for oil, held in foreign banks. The deal released it. It wasn't yours. It wasn't $250B. He's lying, yet again.
8550 2018-04-29 19:14:15 The sad thing is u lied, conned, overworked, more 100% only fate will judge these agents and the so called holy than thou Saudis,

8551 2018-04-29 19:13:59 I have given my son the news that he won't be able to apply to #UAlberta I'm a proud #OilPatch worker and refuse to contribute to anywhere that wants to destroy it. It's now obvious the the Oil sector has better ethics than you. #AlbertaBuilt #AlbertaStrong
8552 2018-04-29 19:13:58 Russia is suffering from the low cost of oil not the sanctions.Saudi is in financial trouble too.The US has a glut of oil due to fracking.Canada's bitumen cost more to produce than sale price.oil is actually artificially high due to Saudi & Russia agreeing to a price and amt sold
8553 2018-04-29 19:13:55 Wow...disappointing tweet sir. Gasoline is ~50% of total oil demand. The other 50% demand impacts price as well - and dont even get me started on taxes.

One might also want to look at currency - oil priced in  $US ...

You can do better.
8554 2018-04-29 19:13:49 sadly true - but not all are that stupid...
situation is changing. And you have to admit that there are also a lot of stubborn Kurdish fanboys who put oil into that burning house...
Road to peace means to come together...
8555 2018-04-29 19:13:48 But yet, the FG and other states stopping their dependence on oil is nigh impossible to happen without a war. ND has to be more strategic, become the bastion of diversification. Insist on more local ownership of oil wells i.e. support Ogoni ownership of OML11.
8556 2018-04-29 19:13:32 Ay as much as I shittalk people for their pizza choices as far as I'm concerned I couldn't care less if anyone eats their pizza with cardboard and motor oil, as long as I get mine with salami. Think most people don't actually care, it's mostly just banter :>

8563 2018-04-29 19:12:19 US thugs are using SDF bitches to squat on Syrian oil wealth illegally, while bribing these corrupt Kurds to do their bidding. You KNOW these Yankee imperialists are in the wrong. This is a cancer inside Syria that will be FOUGHT.
8564 2018-04-29 19:12:13 They can make jokes about the #oil.. though they try a bit to hard on that front.. thr TRUTH remains.. no matter what the Per-Barrel price of oil.. Scotlands oil is a massive benefit to the UK #CreditRating and lowers the cost of borrowing for HMG.
8565 2018-04-29 19:12:10 I’m craving chilli oil. That’s not normal 
8566 2018-04-29 19:11:57 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

8568 2018-04-29 19:11:20 Rare for me to disagree with Lorrie, but seems to me we should not be threatening upset to an already shaky economy which is so dependent upon the oil & gas industry. Let's just do what we can without taxes. Let technology rule! Let's see how China/India do before we go nuts here

He took one look at it, said “nah I look horrible” and never hung it up

8585 2018-04-29 19:09:32 Israel Grants Illegal Oil Rights inside Syria to Murdoch and Rothschild.

The US plan behind the pipeline was to use Qatari gas to wean Europeans off their reliance on Russian gas, undermining the Russian economy.

None of this geopolitical context is given to readers of the MSM.
8586 2018-04-29 19:09:26 Somebody gone say since I work at Chrysler I should know how to change my oil myself. Well guess what? They don’t teach us that! Especially the high seniority department I’m in.. I work where the car is nothing but sheet metal and pieces!!
8587 2018-04-29 19:09:08 exactly ! Some people just want you to fuel their hate deny them the oil. Embargo against hate

8623 2018-04-29 19:02:57 The PM could care less on oil. His only main concern is how to squeeze every penny out of every individual until the country collapses on its own economy. It's starting and will only get worse.  Maybe it's time to rethink what is the true value of energy.
8624 2018-04-29 19:02:52 just needs an oil change
8625 2018-04-29 19:02:44 The reason is simple. Like other new destinations such as Sochi, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and China, which replaced more traditional European races such as Imola and Nurburgring off the calendar, Azerbaijan pays FOM rather a lot of money to host a GP in their oil rich country.

8635 2018-04-29 19:02:04 Welcome to the neighbourhood Greek Table!
Fresh olive oil bar, olives, hummus and loukoumades for dessert!
#greektable  @ Markham Village, Ontario
8636 2018-04-29 19:01:58 its a burnt out oil rig lol , student town over flooded student flats , nothing fun , council terrible decisions (money spending), no future job wise due to closures of shops and factorys
8637 2018-04-29 19:01:53 Yeahhhj bingooo!!soooo beauty..
Heredia un Spain Andalucía oil supperpose them!!?
8638 2018-04-29 19:01:50 I rolled a big truck 5 times end over end and walked away so I can relate! I was going 70 mph with 51000 lbs of oil ina tanker. Lost trailer on 1st turn. Don’t want to do it again! Good luck!
8639 2018-04-29 19:01:49 The US fracking supply was not a factor back then. We had a big customer in the US. THEY NO LONGER NEED AS MUCH OF OUR OIL. Our leadership has been weak on both sides.
8640 2018-04-29 19:01:48 Argan oil  most people recommend it 
Inshallah it will show great results
8641 2018-04-29 19:01:43 Oil tanker starter buttons
8642 2018-04-29 19:01:42 North Sea Fisherman or a Oil Well worker job move for Scotland Coastal Part of the world. Ice cold North Sea..
8643 2018-04-29 19:01:31 Fine .. you get the oil & I’ll pop round. I can go Tesco afterwards 
8644 2018-04-29 19:01:26 I read your time line & as I said you don’t seem to understand the petrodollar. When gas prices dropped last year, NM gross receipts fell & matching funds for Medicare/Medicaid programs dropped, resulting in some health programs having to be cut.  Low oil prices are good & bad!!
8645 2018-04-29 19:01:18 I agree. Iraq never had WMD. But it was a fake rhetoric used by US and UK to attack Iraq. It was all about control and oil. Saddam was not ready to dance to US tunes, so eliminated. Gaddafi similarly eliminated. Sadly for US, Assad has Russian support, so still alive.

8648 2018-04-29 19:01:05 Here in Georgia (US) we have a relatively new olive oil industry that produces some of the best I've ever had. Same area where the Visalia onions come from.
8649 2018-04-29 19:00:56 Dried apricots, oranges and peaches, ancient grain & super seed oatmeal, lemon & elderflower sparkling water, yogurt, hand & body lotion (the best), olive oil, canned beans, & these little snacks made from puffed brown rice, cranberries & pistachios
8650 2018-04-29 19:00:55 Lmao I kno excatly how you feel mfs gotta dropped $60 on a oil change I damn near want to cry 
8651 2018-04-29 19:00:54  Ask your government to support drug traffickers in Americalatina. Why does that leave more money than oil?

8660 2018-04-29 19:00:13 And it was at a public speaking event, plenty of people around. The dossier tried 2 say it was about getting a 19% share in Russian oil if Page could get sanctions lifted. Funny thing: 1) even had the conversation occurred, it’s not a conspiracy to do anything until it’s tried,
8661 2018-04-29 19:00:03 for making fun of someone? seems a bit much tbh. let em make jokes
8662 2018-04-29 19:00:01 He must be a Youth? Does He seat down and wait for oil money? Did He not go to school by his parents money?

8663 2018-04-29 18:59:45 Chilling with my new oil diffuser gushing out @doterra BASIL  ... excellent for anxiety 
8664 2018-04-29 18:59:17 Can’t wait to get this oil change done and out the way tomor
8665 2018-04-29 18:59:14 try cbd oil. no thc but has the other stuff in weed that makes people feel better
8666 2018-04-29 18:59:09 Had to double up on the bubble bath, the bath oil and the epsom salt 
8667 2018-04-29 18:59:06 I got some omega oil to add to my cats food because they are Persians and I feel like it would be good for their fur but they just sniffed their food and gave me the longest death stare lmao  

And it wasn’t cheap! I guess I’m having omega oil for breakfast..
8668 2018-04-29 18:58:47 Oil spill 2010-2013
8669 2018-04-29 18:58:43 I know there is some sort of higher power looking out for me because there was JUST enough canola oil to fill the deep fryer.
8670 2018-04-29 18:58:40 Only if you now turn to the lady sitting right next to you & attack everything about her
8671 2018-04-29 18:58:40 it's about oil. anyway if we didnt keep backing future fascist disctatoes and colluding with terrorist groups I might feel differently about it but at this point, i think we should keep oir nosed (and forces) out of foreign wars.
8672 2018-04-29 18:58:25 I’m not sure what “not impossible” means — what probability should we assign to $300 oil?
 @PTetlock
8673 2018-04-29 18:57:53 What if it ain’t oil based
8674 2018-04-29 18:57:49 Your plan wont meet targets either both the red and blue parties provide no hope to future generations because the oil industry owns both parties
8675 2018-04-29 18:57:46 My penis tastes like white truffle oil
8676 2018-04-29 18:57:13 finding nemo but it's a melodrama during the bp oil spill
8677 2018-04-29 18:57:01 Interesting to see John Bolton talk sense. He's not going to be able to drive a nuking of North Korea, and now he's for an independent Kurdish state (to buy it's oil no doubt).. Are we moving to the #roboeconomic world in which the waste of war is permanently avoided?
8678 2018-04-29 18:56:55 In today's world I understand it's almost impossible to avoid oil. The only oils I would use would be the cold pressed oils as the nutrients would remain most intact during the extraction. Seed, nut and avocado oils would be the best in my opinion.
8679 2018-04-29 18:56:55 Exactly. Plentiful oil & natural gas, likely multiple centuries of reserves. More about the process of extracting it. Thanks to horizontal drilling and fracking its both plentiful and cheap, with a continuum of innovation continually driving up efficiencies. Game changer for USA!
8680 2018-04-29 18:56:53 Maybe you need lavender oil
8681 2018-04-29 18:56:53 To let him speak like this is the atrocity. He's a snake oil salesmen
8682 2018-04-29 18:56:50 Very different beast, your cheddar.  American cheddar just turns to a puddle of oil.  I like a nice Red Leicester, myself.
8683 2018-04-29 18:56:48 i don't believe so. im 99% sure that would cause a yeast infection too bc it's oil based and it's also for external use only lol
8684 2018-04-29 18:56:25 The Marula oil has been my fave since I started using the glowpot. I have been using it every night and I wake up with my skin feeling so soft
8685 2018-04-29 18:56:14 @jimmyfallon caution: Manuel Petersmarck is not Jewish. Not Israeli. Spoke west German at 10 th grade level. I told him no I was not going to move with him to dry Oklahoma from elite western Pennsylvania farm, thoroughbred,aqha. Oil reserves in ok. Fix  , could he?
8686 2018-04-29 18:55:59 Ang hirap mag diet! daming bawal yung oil bawal pork bawal yung maasin or maalat lalo na yung Ice cream and fries and yung favorite ko na burger
8687 2018-04-29 18:55:53 Why can't we do this everyday? Why can't I walk into a pharmacy and hand in my old medicine anytime? I can dispose of old batteries, oil, paint, plastic any day of the week, why not pharmaceuticals?
8688 2018-04-29 18:55:22 Baby oil? That’s it?? Noted! Thank you! Lol
8689 2018-04-29 18:55:20 Infected person should rub coconut oil against the infected part and drink some
8690 2018-04-29 18:55:07 Unilaterally withdrawing from the Iranian nuke deal would put the US at in a weaker position. We should work with the Europeans and China to put pressure on Iran to expand the scope of the deal. Iran's main export is oil, which goes to the EU and China giving them more Leverage
8691 2018-04-29 18:55:04 Oh? Is he going to shut down all of the resource industries of Canada? No more coal, oil, diamond mines, peat, molybdenum, etc...  wonder how his industry donors feel about that?
8692 2018-04-29 18:54:52 Feeling rather peckish now Nah, mine get covered in coconut oil 
8693 2018-04-29 18:54:52 I couldn't believe someone could be so callus and call it humor.
8694 2018-04-29 18:54:46 I need to oil my hair
8695 2018-04-29 18:54:41 Have you seen the @exxonmobil commercial of how smart their scientists are for creating what would be fuel for our cars? It is messy. Can you smell the fear big oil must have from #ElectricCars and of course #tesla. Your time has come #bigoilcompanies. #ev
8696 2018-04-29 18:54:41 ( swishing) Kind of taper that land off like it's recessed, or any type of oil that's nice.
8697 2018-04-29 18:54:34 I just started trying. In some messed up order. It is pretty good stuff though eh
8698 2018-04-29 18:54:33 Coconut oil mask twice a week. Massage it into your scalp and ends, leave it for an hour, wash it out with conditioner, then wash your hair normally with shampoo. Jojoba and castor oil is also really good for hair growth.
8699 2018-04-29 18:54:28 LMAO because it’s true I’m not gonna say anything but you know those knees need some oil
8700 2018-04-29 18:54:19 #pakodanomics was for upsell the Lala Ramdev's product like besan and refine oil. now is #PanKiDukan  to upsell the lost business of drugs after @INCIndia punjab victory?
8701 2018-04-29 18:54:17 Clean air, water protection for the elderly in nursing homes, protecting us from future Russian involvement in our elections enforcing sanctions against the Russians-his oil deregs place our water in further danger along with the oil rigs/wildlife Let god judge/we don't need wall
8702 2018-04-29 18:54:07 We actually have a doctor (yes MD) in town, who have taken the role of health and diet Guru along the low carb avenue. And she’s actively advocating coconut oil. Problem is: she’s impervious to scientific arguments. But she DOES make money!
8703 2018-04-29 18:53:58 You prepare a table before me in the Presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows Psalms23v5  #VerseThatTouchedMe
8704 2018-04-29 18:53:36 Oil pipeline through Korea's also.
8705 2018-04-29 18:53:27 For what will Atiku probe President Mohammadu Buhari? Is it because of the oil block licence revoked?
8706 2018-04-29 18:53:24 Yes.

Yes, you are.

Please pass the ketchup.
8707 2018-04-29 18:53:23 This pair of second rate snake oil salesmen. Don't bother.
8708 2018-04-29 18:53:10 I wish they were still that price.!!! Funny year that 1.. Oil Crisis & and loads of great timeless Xmas songs first released.. Who knew..
8709 2018-04-29 18:52:35 So invading other countries for the oil industries is fighting for our "freedom"? How does that work again?
8710 2018-04-29 18:52:31 my dad has had a whole family of saabs. owns three now. only severe failure was when the shop forgot to put oil in the gearbox. mom's volvo, otoh, threw a rod. she drives a honda now. if you wanted a reliable saab, i would NOT have picked volvo... i've got an '11 mx5 and '01 S600
8711 2018-04-29 18:52:19 I had vegetable oil, onions and pepper in a wok.
8712 2018-04-29 18:52:19 If Mitt can sue Harry for claims he made of not paying taxes
Admiral Jackson can sue Jon Tester for claim that now will never be adjudicated
8713 2018-04-29 18:52:16 Sorry to hear that. The other option is clove oil, use it sparingly though! x
8714 2018-04-29 18:52:12 “He’s so broke, he looked for foreign oil in Don Jr.’s hair.”
8715 2018-04-29 18:52:02 Just paid $64 for an oil change.. my dad could’ve did that shit for free 
8716 2018-04-29 18:51:59 Nowhere else on this planet can a country have such wealth and yet exist in such abject poverty. In less than 70 years, Saudi Arabia grew from a barren desert to one of the leading powers in the Middle East because of their oil. You wonder why that isn't happening here
8717 2018-04-29 18:51:49 Religion claims god exists.
God is snake oil
8718 2018-04-29 18:51:44 Did you know that if you sautee diced onions in a small amount of vegetable oil you get the exact smell of fish? 

I swear!! My hands smell like sweet fish. Like I've been handling high grade salmon or river fish. This is weird. :/
8719 2018-04-29 18:51:36 i mean, you got enough oil on that forehead to grease my bicycle chain
8720 2018-04-29 18:51:26 IT HAD MORE OIL THAN SOME GULF EMIRATES
8721 2018-04-29 18:50:49 i'm waiting for the moment when my mom stops using a ton of oil for her cooking
8722 2018-04-29 18:50:42 Cold Cream from Boots for your skin!! And mix some olive oil with conditioner, massage into your scalp and leave overnight!
8723 2018-04-29 18:50:39 Lol, you said awesome sauce..
8724 2018-04-29 18:50:34 what oil cleanser you using? I tried but wasn’t impressed - probably my product.
8725 2018-04-29 18:50:28 But the bragging rights for upper west side IYIs who buy expensive olive oil like fine wines!
8726 2018-04-29 18:50:08 funding of father of eugenic sexual revolutionaries perv AlfredKinsey Soros/Gates critics describe @ financing govt-controlled social change Heffner, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil helped HitlerThird Reich, HarryTruman, D-Mo., described the Rockefeller involvement as treason
8727 2018-04-29 18:50:01 Tell that to the cancer survivors that were saved by CBD oil, not chemotherapy. Marijuana was deemed illegal for 4 reasons: 1) hemp oil competes with fossil fuels. 2) propaganda isn't as effective with light use. 3) CBD has medicinal purposes. 4) hard to regulate and tax.
8728 2018-04-29 18:50:00 Y'all come out to the tire fire tonight and see ya boi BiG DoG chug motor oil and burn donuts in the Trans Am awooooooooooo

8732 2018-04-29 18:49:09 I have hemp shampoo and I don’t care for it much. Feels course. I’m sure it has many many other useful benefits but not on my hair . My favorite hair products right now are tea tree oil conditioner and Carol’s Daughters  products.
8733 2018-04-29 18:49:06 Beautiful selection of oil burners available here at Gifts and Glitz in Nelson Market. All at affordable prices.
8734 2018-04-29 18:48:47 MCT Oil and straight black coffee with no food in my stomach TERRIBLE IDEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

8736 2018-04-29 18:48:28 Screw on oil filters are the worst why can’t everyone just have an easy to reach housing near the top of the engine
8737 2018-04-29 18:48:22 Well nearly 50% inc in emissions cap for Alberta's oil sands sector (From 70 to 100 MtCO2) is clearly quantifiable. Just who has to work harder to make that up is unclear and maybe the reason Mckenna is pushing NB to adopt an incremental carbon tax even though NB has met targets
8738 2018-04-29 18:48:22 Won't be long pal before were using the carrot oil 
8739 2018-04-29 18:48:21 Watch the documentary. Then start looking into other international mining ventures within Africa. Like gold mining in Burkina Faso, oil in Chad, uranium in Niger. Then look at the respective economies and watch reality stop making sense.
8740 2018-04-29 18:48:19 Niggggaaa you do not need oil for burgers
8741 2018-04-29 18:48:02 can stop him.

8742 2018-04-29 18:47:46 The cure is “COCONUT OIL “
8743 2018-04-29 18:47:30 I lack the self control it takes to not get full off of the bread and olive oil
8744 2018-04-29 18:47:18 Glide capable sections, capable of water landings (ocean, river, lake, canal, artificial liquid runways of oil, artificial runways covered w/ rolling tires like newer guard rails but horizontal) vaguely like the shuttle landers in Interstellar ??

Healthy, hearty and so friggin good!!
8748 2018-04-29 18:46:55 Coconut oil and olive oil helped my sister.
8749 2018-04-29 18:46:51 You could have just put a period after “Confused.”
8750 2018-04-29 18:46:51 U cannot do a damn thing about it.  Oil companies charge for oil not yet in refinery but it is rip-off of consumers. Will never change because too much money & corruption involved. Need alt energy like solar, wind & electric cars. Wake up but you will not.
8751 2018-04-29 18:46:48 Who's got the oil boiling?
8752 2018-04-29 18:46:29 Prescribe turmeric and fish oil?
8753 2018-04-29 18:46:28 Yep... definitely put too much oil in the diffuser. At least the house smells nice. Even if I am chocking to death.

8757 2018-04-29 18:45:52 @ProfTimNoakes - Hi Tim please can you help ? If microbes absorb calories from fat and I eat a diet made up of 70% fat, what does this mean for microbiome? Apparently I should avoid high fat food except olive oil?!! #lchf#   #notgivingupthefat# #healthygut#
8758 2018-04-29 18:45:52 ...
8759 2018-04-29 18:45:36 Can we add clean energy to the list and not living in fear of when there will be an oil spill that will leave people devastated?
8760 2018-04-29 18:45:31 Wow come up with something original. The "oil money" argument is as stale as (Bill) Clinton's presidency.
8761 2018-04-29 18:45:28 A roast is never done with hatred. She doesn't understand that because much like "journalists" of today, comedians have forgotten how to do their chosen profession.
8762 2018-04-29 18:45:18 Yes! I need me a bottle from a booth! They can’t be using regular oil!
8763 2018-04-29 18:45:14 If I was prime minister, there would be no gorier oil bright in,, PERIOD!!!
8764 2018-04-29 18:45:08 Pescatarian - Vegetarian - fruititarian - raw vegan - Junk food vegan - homegrown vegan - pure organic olive oil vegan
8765 2018-04-29 18:44:59 Using economics to oppose independence is a false argument. No-one correctly estimated UK's future 20 years ago. UK just increased debt to cover the shortfall in oil revenues. The UK relies on the broad shoulders of bond investors because its shoulders have eroded away.
8766 2018-04-29 18:44:52 Need some carnival oil to go back wid
8767 2018-04-29 18:44:50 Bio oil we use over here. That will moisturise it and help the scar to fade.

8769 2018-04-29 18:44:41 Aw! KP. *brings tub of just barely hot water and a good amount of epsom salt and two drops of tea tree oil for good measure.*
8770 2018-04-29 18:44:37 @Short_Squeeze_ Markets yes, Oil with the news coming out of Iran, may catch a bid with the Nuclear deal taking focus.
8771 2018-04-29 18:44:34 In hindsight you can now see how the cards were against us to begin with. 2 young strikers, one that's never played in Italy and the other with little experience. Kalinic was supposed to be the boost but turned out to be the oil in the water.
8772 2018-04-29 18:44:32 Fire zone. Put oil at the base of wall and set it afire.

Of course, it will probably kill us, so.
8776 2018-04-29 18:44:08 If you mix the coconut oil with a little baking soda it makes a great oral toothpaste for dogs as well." These people are insane.

8780 2018-04-29 18:43:31 Amazing how today's generation thinks today. It's no wonder our kids of today are so disrespectful. The coconut oil can be used as a digestive lubricant for dogs and at the same time it has anti bacterial properties and anti fungal.
8781 2018-04-29 18:43:25 Getty founded the Getty Oil Company, and in 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American.

8786 2018-04-29 18:43:02 My fav: "Wow all these comments don't coincide with the question. I don't get it. What does a rubber dildo have to do with the type of coconut oil she uses for her dog. Just because someone misspelled a word or two
Just threw the actual question right out the ball park.
8787 2018-04-29 18:42:59 so i put a lil mental clarity oil on my forehead and NOW IT BURNS WTF DO I DO

8790 2018-04-29 18:42:15 I feel so bad for these ppl who had to put an oil change on my broke ass car lmao
8791 2018-04-29 18:42:05 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
8792 2018-04-29 18:42:04 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8796 2018-04-29 18:41:32 But then that would leave the door open for us to have another referendum "See when you said you didn't want to be independent with your whisky and oil and good sense about caring for each other? Do you want another crack at the whip?"
I want both or either but it won't happen
8797 2018-04-29 18:41:20 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
8798 2018-04-29 18:41:17 No. Not exactly. But orange is a bit of the general "citrus" flavor. The use of brominated vegetable oil to stop the orange juice from separating (requiring shaking) is why you can't get it in Europe.
8799 2018-04-29 18:41:09 I'm in the oil business.  I'm not against tracking, just urban fracking.

8807 2018-04-29 18:40:45 Fatuous reasoning.  Another 6 - 12 months and you’d’ve been routed because of the oil price.
8808 2018-04-29 18:40:35 How does it feel? Like does it feel more like working with acrylic or oil? I'll be painting over the summer and I was recommended gouache since I can't continue oil in my home.
8809 2018-04-29 18:40:35 Yes, resources like our oil and gas industries that many First Nations are trying to capitalize on.

8817 2018-04-29 18:39:51 You’re losing a lot more than just the argument here Stewart! Who will read your “Citizens Guide To Oil Spills” now?
8818 2018-04-29 18:39:42 20 years will not be needed. They will have made progress the Arabic culture, all those who will have made it will have grown rich without doing anything, watered(sprayed) by the money of the oil, and all the Westerners and not Arabic of cultures will be eliminated on their path.
8819 2018-04-29 18:39:37 I hear sey u chop 69years.. Happy birthday @Dat_ChiqS3dinam.. Age in the oil of God's grace 
8820 2018-04-29 18:39:36 This is bearish for me. Market is too long on the short term of the curve and oil producers are shorting the long end for hedging. Oil producers are always right.
8821 2018-04-29 18:39:36 おっはよぉいる！
8822 2018-04-29 18:39:15 Got the prettiest oil lamps today. Can't wait to figure out where to put them all. God, I'm old  getting excited over oil lamps
8823 2018-04-29 18:39:13 IDK about veganism, but Say's Law indicates that your demand theory is incorrect, because crude oil is a fungible commodity.
8824 2018-04-29 18:39:06 I know but damnnnnn looking at that HURT lol. Castor oil will be my bff for the next few months.

8828 2018-04-29 18:38:28 In the Lower Mainland local and provincial politicians are against the pipeline because they have been elected to be that way. In the North things are not this way. Most people vote for oil and gas development. Its a different world up there.
8829 2018-04-29 18:38:26 A bottle, large size, of oilve oil poured over said trash mouth with a call for Deliverance in Jesus's MIGHTY Name would take care of it in the blink of an eye.

8832 2018-04-29 18:38:00 My step dad works his butt off those 9 months!! He even thought about quitting at one point and working in the oil field cause it might be easier. That’s how you know teaching is hard, when you think oil field work is easier than teaching!
8833 2018-04-29 18:37:59 Calgary's whole economic model is real estate and oil and gas head offices.
8834 2018-04-29 18:37:54 Does anyone know if there’s any real serious studies being done on the claims that cannabis oil can cure cancer? Excluding any funded by people who make money from the disease.
8835 2018-04-29 18:37:54 all i wanted is hotsauce, nacho cheese doritos & canola oil to make my buffalo chicken ......
8836 2018-04-29 18:37:46 @darrenk814 Trader Joe's didn't have the Zhoug sauce so I bought the ingredients and made it at home. It's so good. Cilantro, parsley, jalapenos, garlic, dried coriander, salt, pepper, olive oil. I can give you the recipe if you want.
8837 2018-04-29 18:37:46 So much friggin oil they cant even release into the market with Venezuela drama, Permian transport weaknesses,build up in Alberta reserves, growing rig count by the month... & this deal has until July to truly be an issue? 15/1 long Brent and 10/1 long WTI are the topic not this.
8838 2018-04-29 18:37:36 Ah, the contrast between differences of opinion and unbridled hate.
8839 2018-04-29 18:37:30 I'm wondering how much longer $DCR can fly under the radar. Must be all the silver tongue snake oil salesmen hypnotizing newbs these days...will take awhile for cream to rise to the top, with the current vaporware fest going on.

8851 2018-04-29 18:35:41 Oil prices depends on international market so mr. Chidamram do not give data which certain people can not understand...another thing in 60 years your congress made system(corruption and dynasty rajnity) thats why certain states is neglected..so now stop deviding politics..

8876 2018-04-29 18:31:33 Bout to try this cannibus oil out
8877 2018-04-29 18:31:27 It was a little mind bending recently to see the American petroleum institute promoting natural gas. The oil industry is now very active in nat. gas exploration production distribution & marketing. LNG has helped create a global market which the oil majors like. Is hydrogen next?
8878 2018-04-29 18:31:18 The US doesn't need oil. We, the West, want a peaceful, democratic and multicultural region that supports minorities and all the religions. Not only Islam!
8879 2018-04-29 18:31:18 That'll do it... Hope the weather stays nice for a spot of pottering around... A nice run out to oil can cafe maybe... See if @battowl fancies a run too, he's on that recovery roller coaster as well and out your way

Why no computers in the 900s?
Why no GMOs in the 1200s?
Why is there oil in the Earth but no gasoline?
Wouldn't that b more intelligent design?
And is God laughing at us as we destroy His planet by digging and burning fossils when there's actually a better way?
8922 2018-04-29 18:26:24 Thanks for the tip! That looks perfect. I like the sound of those essential oil blends and always wanted to try a beard balm @BalboBeardCo
8923 2018-04-29 18:26:22 Greedy oil companies are behind the jump  at the pump. They make excuses it is this or that causing the hike. But it is BULLYING the public. They can get away with it so why not raise the price and line their pockets.
8924 2018-04-29 18:26:18 Swampland and snake oil sales slickers could learn much from them.
8925 2018-04-29 18:25:44 C was a slime making machine yesterday. Unfortunately, she fell asleep playing with it & woke up with a big glob in her hair. I hate slime. Oil works! My cuticles look fabulous now! #Oil2TheRescue #DIYMani #IHateSlime #4thGradeCrafter

8927 2018-04-29 18:25:34 I actually think it is more a case of not understanding the physical oil market, hearing some points and then putting 2and 2 together and getting 50. Everything I have read appears to have been written by people that have not actually read the contract.

8929 2018-04-29 18:25:28 Took my car to the shop to get my headlamp replaced, and the mechanic said that I desperately needed an oil change because he's never seen oil so black. Ha. You fool. I put vegetable oil in my car last week. You can't fool me. I've seen Initial D twice now. #cantupselldisguy #hah
8930 2018-04-29 18:25:13 I feel like an old getting an oil change on a Sunday afternoon.
8931 2018-04-29 18:24:48 But the thing is that Syria is in the way for potential oil and gas pipe lines to Europe, so NATO countries are unlikely to leave Syria alone. I doubt smear campaigns are going to stop, not until Syria turned into Iraq.
8932 2018-04-29 18:24:39 If only fish was as plentiful and demanded as oil, mngejua wajaluo. You've got nothing on them.
8933 2018-04-29 18:24:30 You served your country? Lol. Also known as you failed your GCSE’s and has fuck all else to do. As we haven’t actually had a just war since WW2, that means you were either thieving oil off brown people or shooting at Irish civilians. So you’ve done fuck all then.

8936 2018-04-29 18:24:22 Hey, may I ask you in this tweet which probably won't generate a big thread, do you know a site that gives the good dosage for fish oil? You mentioned that some time back, and I don't know the magic number. Or just tell me the recommended dosage?
8937 2018-04-29 18:24:13 The Amazonification of Big Oil is Blockchain Technology.  What will oil use as Benchmark currency?

8955 2018-04-29 18:21:40 Hypocrisy or what:
So, as Horgan tries to stop more Canadian oil from coming into B.C., Vancouver is building a pipeline to bring in imported oil – supporting jobs in Asia instead of jobs here in Canada.

8968 2018-04-29 18:20:12 I'm not sure that certainty is possible with any climate policy.  We know that the Paris Agreement requires ratcheting up of ambition.  Given the life expectancy of most oil and gas projects I don't think any one could predict carbon pricing or regulations over the timeframe.
8969 2018-04-29 18:20:08 Syria is in the way of potential oil pipe lines to Europe so I doubt the Syria civil war is ever going to end. Syria could become the second Iraq.
8970 2018-04-29 18:20:08 2 - The other option is to sell the crude oil to Dangote’s refinery. He pays us a billion dollars in Naira equivalent. 

We now take the same Naira in our account and buy the PMS from him - a billion dollars worth. 

At the end of the day, there is also no money in the account.

8984 2018-04-29 18:17:50 It's the ingredient that makes shampoo foam up. Bear in mind it can become a vicious cycle - the shampoo strips the oil so your scalp makes more oil and on and on
8985 2018-04-29 18:17:50 @SKODAUK we have just got our new 1.5tsi DSG #karoq and I was wondering what the service intervals are? Is says inspection in 19,400 miles, 700 days but is it due oil service in 12 months, 10,000? Not sure if the service and maintenance plan is worthwhile. Thanks
8986 2018-04-29 18:17:46 I called my mom over this and she says you're both fools
wash them, cut them lengthwise, fry them in a bit of olive oil mixed with butter (only a couple minutes on each side, don't overfry them) and then put them on soft toast and eat

8991 2018-04-29 18:16:47 Tofu I’m pretty sure the oil he conjures normally is flammable. Zabi uses his sacred artifact and it instantly all burns up-wait I’m pretty sure that’s what it was supposed to do does that make it an outlier?
8992 2018-04-29 18:16:47 So there are 2 ways we can get the PMS we need. 

1. We sell a billion dollars worth of crude oil to a foreigner. Put the money in our bank account. Buy a billion dollars worth of PMS and pay with the money in our account.

At the end of the day, there is no money in the account.
8993 2018-04-29 18:16:44 Am I the only person out here who's on Iran's side?? I've had the pleasure of knowing a number of Iranians over the years and they're really great people. We've screwed their country over and over again, for oil and Israel.

8995 2018-04-29 18:16:32 Ha. I often wear coconut perfume oil, that would have scared you off 
8996 2018-04-29 18:16:21 That is what I used to do with my kids and grandkids. Another option is giving fractious baby a bath and lotioning them with some lavender baby oil, lavender is super soothing.
8997 2018-04-29 18:16:20 I used to have bad hay fever and started using ownsworths rapeseed oil and it has done us a power of good. Apparently if you have local honey it is supposed to help too :)
8998 2018-04-29 18:16:19 The EU didnt reduce an oil rich country to bankrupt ,or whatever you call it when you dont want to use the word bankrupt.
Maybe the other RUPT that UK media never mentions was responsible

9013 2018-04-29 18:14:06 The most Important thing is to use an oil that is NOT petrol based, as petrol based oils will react with your filament (especially ABS and PETG) and PTFE tubes, and degrade them making them sticky.

9019 2018-04-29 18:13:09 Doesn’t really imply anything really. 

Let me use a very simplified version to explain.

Imagine we consume a billion dollars worth of PMS everyday. 

Also imagine that from a billion dollars worth of crude oil, you can get a billion dollars worth of PMS.
9020 2018-04-29 18:13:04 I wonder if King Arslan's sword can also conjure up flammable oils, but he doesn't do so out of principal. Then again, he can conjure an oil so horrible it was used as a chemical weapon, and all he used it for was to dress up as Frankenstein.

9026 2018-04-29 18:12:38 It was mainly a using up leftovers kind of thing but still yummy! I had pasta with olive oil and added fried onion, yellow pepper, courgette, garlic, cherry tomatoes, dwarf beans and kale. 100% recommend even if it just an easy one.
9027 2018-04-29 18:12:20 I did try this at the Wendy's near Cleveland's Westside market. It was good. The nuggets were cooked in oil a bit too hot (air pockets), but the cheeseburger deluxe was perfect, and the fries were nice & fresh! It was a quick stop between appointments: worth it! Good service!

9035 2018-04-29 18:10:10 that is why I stick with 3-1 oil it should not go rancid  i think it maybe highly refined mineral oil or similar . Usually the glycerine in oils/fats gets them sticky etc.

9041 2018-04-29 18:09:21 The laughable thing is they obviously have no idea how much of their lives are because of oil.

9043 2018-04-29 18:09:11 The degree to which no one thinks about the price of oil is shocking, and it would take very little to lead to social calls for change.

9046 2018-04-29 18:08:35 Fascinating. Missing an important input, however. Crude.  Once oil rises in price, to accommodate these higher prod costs, they will impact the cost stream of renewables, raising their input costs accordingly. R.E. has enjoyed an input discount that crude producers have suffered.
9047 2018-04-29 18:08:33 Good read, but good luck getting any oil company going anywhere near B.C. in the next decade, and with federal Liberal support you can make that two decades!

9062 2018-04-29 18:06:03 Good point and it boils to your question, “What is the /bbl cost?” and then profitability after that. The figure I’ve heard from pro oil is 30% more, before the costs are factored in after transport and before we even get past any of the political costs most of us are aware of.

9072 2018-04-29 18:04:10 Buying crude oil directly is speculation, not investing. People *invest* to explore and produce reserves that can be distributed at a margin

9076 2018-04-29 18:03:03 Uhh, cost per barrel is at a low, cost at the pump is alltime high. More ((extremely expensive and hard to process)) oil sands getting to the market is not going to help your costs one bit. Driving less will tho.
9077 2018-04-29 18:02:51 I found oil on wood filament was a MUST to reduce friction in my bowden drive & nozzle buildup too. That said it helps.
9078 2018-04-29 18:02:48 Aye! Westminster and their big biz pals certainly have been the proximate cause of misery around the globe. Though I am a Scot and not a Brit. Norway’s approach to NS oil & gas sure shows how corrupt the political establishment have been down the decades.
9079 2018-04-29 18:02:44 I’ve been doing large chunks of Yukon golds cooked through in alkaline water, then roasted in garlic-chili infused olive oil at 450 for an hour. Crispy and fluffy. One day I’ll get tired of it, but it hasn’t happened yet.

9112 2018-04-29 17:59:45 The US is paying the same price for oil, pipelines or not.  It is well head that is suffering, due to transport cost recapture and pre-delivery storage costs. It could be argued that tidewater access will increase price, due to competition, but that remains theoretical.

9123 2018-04-29 17:57:49 We don't have to do the same for oil and gas extraction which do far more damage to all of what you mentioned. Why are you not asking that put a moratorium on oil and gas extraction?

9195 2018-04-29 17:49:14 Enemies getting allies to do leg work for them...as with Oil for Food program the wheels of Iran's nuclear program greased by many so called allies making billions from the cash stolen by Obama from our Treasury...Iran turning "six party talk" scheme used w/ DPRK against us
9196 2018-04-29 17:49:10 I need to go get an oil change ASAP  my ass keep procrastinating and my car gone stop on my Dumbass
9197 2018-04-29 17:49:01 How about: 1) there are no plans to fire...  2) we’ve already addressed that. (you haven’t); 3) that’s not what he meant when he said...
9198 2018-04-29 17:48:59 I agree with you, MIB. Although it is genetic.  She got it from her father. She nursed on snake oil.  From his beefy teat.
9199 2018-04-29 17:48:47 Interesting, I've always heard use vegetable oil. And with that comes the array of household cooking oils... Is avacado oil better or worse because of its higher temperature? What about the other cooking oils, how do their temperatures play into things?
9200 2018-04-29 17:48:40 I’ve been in the oil patch this week
9201 2018-04-29 17:48:37 Secondly, I personally have almost straight hair; yet I cannot use hotel shampoo (even though, as you claim, it’s for white people) because my hair is OILY. If I used that thing, my hair would be compared to olive oil. So, don’t just be ignorant about something as small as that.
9202 2018-04-29 17:48:34 And then the snake oil adverts ceased.

9205 2018-04-29 17:48:14 At a show we went to last year, there was a stall saying they could cure chronic pain with......

Emu oil

9206 2018-04-29 17:48:04 Decimal 3 points in general, plus I believe that the businesses that take from our lands (freely (?) Like coal, gas,oil, water, chemicals being dumped in the sky etc. Or do those companies load a Gluttens pockets up!
9207 2018-04-29 17:47:59 And we won’t forget those Republicans that receive $ from the NRA, those destroying our lands because of oil, special interest groups (banks, pharmaceutical companies, etc), we haven’t forgotten our citizens in PR, I could go on!
9208 2018-04-29 17:47:49 @BarRefaeli with that said i dont really understand people who just need to be busy. like if thats the case why not just squeeze tomato ketchup all over ur kitchen floor & add olive oil & the clean it up. thats definitely being busy lol
9209 2018-04-29 17:47:41 @oil_shaeikh did you delete the tweet you were saying you are out here in the sun force to receive Bukola Saraki? Cos I just saw your picture with him smiling. Doesn't look like you are being force to
9210 2018-04-29 17:47:18 Also note that BC Ctax is an "allowable expense" for crude oil & nat gas producers & processors, i.e. 100% deductible from royalties payable at current & foreseeable gas prices.
9211 2018-04-29 17:47:16 I agree what the hell,, all the oil asswipes are raking it in. Every day that bastard does something that screws normal American people..But there are more of us ! Everyone needs to get out the vote!! Mueller needs our help....

9213 2018-04-29 17:46:58 i have used 3-1 oil on my filament with a sponge
9214 2018-04-29 17:46:57 maybe a bit of that and some veg oil to cook in, I could see it. You really use the grease to make the sauce outside of the cheese, it sticks and coats everything.
9215 2018-04-29 17:46:55 Saddam announced he would only trade oil for Euro’s and not Dollars a couple months before we had him strung up...   de-dollarization is real, it happening, and it dangerous as fuck!
9216 2018-04-29 17:46:45 With the appending World Cup approaching, clubs and agents are going wait until after then and pump players  to the highest bidder. We can’t compete with oil or money laundering clubs. We like to sell before we buy, which will leave us panic buying before the window closes.
9217 2018-04-29 17:46:44 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9218 2018-04-29 17:46:44 happy birthday to my son!
 8 years ago he was about 12 hours old and i was amazed he chose to come to a planet where thousands of gallons of oil were spewing into the gulf of mexico every minute.
he knows to respect nature is deep
9219 2018-04-29 17:46:38 To be fair Big Lots would let Sadam Hussein shop at their store. I’d give them 2 years before they’re insolvent
9220 2018-04-29 17:46:29 *Puts castor oil on my bank account*
9221 2018-04-29 17:46:08 Except HSBC didn't bail on the oil sands. In fact, in my interview with Ms. Wilks she emphasized just now much HSBC wants to continue financing the oil sands, but only projects with a declining carbon-intensity...which is just about all of them. HuffPo got it wrong. Surprised?
9222 2018-04-29 17:46:06 Pretty good I use it as a replacement for mince. Basically it’s the same but needs a little more water/oil/butter due to it not having its own fat. I do sauces with it where I cook the sauce for a long time on a low heat.
9223 2018-04-29 17:46:06 A lot of ingredients like Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil  and many other are very good at maintaining natural coarse hair as well  growing it healthy.
9224 2018-04-29 17:46:01 I require a functional homemade vegan butter recipe! The ones I've tried have failed me, and Earth balance is so $$$ (and palm oil etc.). HMPH
9225 2018-04-29 17:46:00 i spilled vegetable oil on the kitchen floor and accidentally cut myself. what a day its gonna be.

9230 2018-04-29 17:45:05 Orangatangs are critically endangered because of the ubiquitous use of palm oil. They may go extinct in the next 10 years. Gorillas are endangered because of wars, poaching, and habitat loss.

9234 2018-04-29 17:44:42 What is looking the US army in a sovereign country 8,000 miles away home? Gas or oil? Is it just stating a beach head for the Iran war or what? What is clear is the steadfastness to destroy another country in the Bush list for seven in five yrs. Syrians have right to fight back!
9235 2018-04-29 17:44:31 “Oil & water don’t mix.” 

Incredible relationship wisdom from @cjharrisone at @crossover813 today.
9236 2018-04-29 17:44:29 If you have a very good relationship with your Md yes, usually they won’t   even say the word. My epileptiologist tells me keep taking what you have home .   as it relates to oil always start little by little, is one of the strongest delivery methods .

9246 2018-04-29 17:43:23 The ski sequence! The parachute! The theme song! The Lotus! Jaws! The movie pastiches! The oil tanker set! The sad deletion of "bulls eye, fishmonger". Safari suits! It has it all.
9247 2018-04-29 17:43:18 Oil money have ruined football
9248 2018-04-29 17:43:16 Not entirely true, Annie, but you're close.
It's not about the oil  or pipelines per se, more to do with what currency it has to be bought in.
When a middle-Eastern nation drops the #PetroDollar, it's not long before US military is knocking on the door.
Video on it tomorrow.
9249 2018-04-29 17:43:16 Never using oil paints again. This shit dries forever

9251 2018-04-29 17:43:00 Realized thanks to the new job, I am about to roll up on my next oil change due date and am still 2k miles from needing it. Compare that to the old job when I had to get an oil change every 6-7 weeks. Lmao
9252 2018-04-29 17:42:55 @Channel4News If Myanmar had lots of minerals or oil you can be sure that the U.S. UK and the French would be in like a ferret down a rabbit hole.

9257 2018-04-29 17:42:12 noooo, let's smash the transfer window, don't let the bandwagon of 'oil money FC' to stop
9258 2018-04-29 17:42:11 I learnt some interesting facts about UK fossil fuel subsidies last week, apparently there's quite a lot of support for those looking to extract oil and gas around the world in the form of Government underwriting risk....I'm gonna keep this thread going with other gas examples

Don't tell me castor oil pls. It's thick.
9262 2018-04-29 17:41:44 Thank you for the tips - mum is using clove oil - and lots of painkillers . She has got some aspirin so may try that. 
9263 2018-04-29 17:41:29 Thank you. It's one of those things I feel I shouldn't like yet somehow do. It's certainly uplifting and more ethical than palm oil!
9264 2018-04-29 17:40:57 Thank you for this. Thank you for sharing his story. Pray for the people of Syria. pawns in oligarch oil wars.
9265 2018-04-29 17:40:49 Oil changes are simple.
9266 2018-04-29 17:40:44 I didn't. And "apologies for big oil" failed to convey the spirit of open inquiry you were shooting for
9267 2018-04-29 17:40:42 Go for it !! Go run for office, get the funding and watch how fast the Big Oil and Big Corps want that money for other things.

9273 2018-04-29 17:40:02 @caveofbeauty when using direct acides from the Ordinary, specifically lactic and salicylic, do you apply them after toning and hydrating but before moisturizing and sealing w/oil? Or do you apply then wash off?
9274 2018-04-29 17:39:56 Others agree w/ indexes near YTD lows on stellar earnings & news flows. Add in a tax & stimulus plan to boot, higher initial gdp print. Subtract low consumer spend & import #, higher oil and rates. Someone is selling equities.

9278 2018-04-29 17:38:14 It is nice to know that some people that voted leave were not racist the man should be selling snake oil that's what you get for your money if you vote liberal democrat 
9279 2018-04-29 17:38:13 BP's chief economist Spencer Date on @POLITICOEurope EU Confidential: "We're never going to run out of oil, we're never going to run out of gas" ...?!
9280 2018-04-29 17:38:08 You a Yinzer?
9281 2018-04-29 17:38:08 It’s a hot oil treatment! I’m not home so I can’t look at the name but you just heat it up, put it in your hair while it’s dry and you wrap your hair to keep the warm moist in, and then rinse it out after like 20-30 minutes
9282 2018-04-29 17:38:03 This lady ordered a chicken teriyaki sandwich, with a handful of black olives and a shit ton of salt & mayo/ oil/vinegar on it.. 5 min later she comes back and says my kid refuses to eat it.... well lady would you eat it? Lmfaoo
9283 2018-04-29 17:37:56 This is what an invasion of a foreign land to steal their oil looks like
9284 2018-04-29 17:37:47 More than Brussels sprout & cod liver oil flavored ice cream?!  Wow.

9288 2018-04-29 17:37:28 They were good, considering I forgot to add olive oil to the dough and I haven’t got any semolina flour for dusting. I’m hit and miss with typical  bread dough, but I’m fine when it comes to making pizza and pasta dough.

9290 2018-04-29 17:37:21 Girls olive oil is a gift from God use it lol
9291 2018-04-29 17:37:19 Westminster are trying to cheat cos they cant beat the snp fairly at the ballot box,,when its clear that half of scots voters wont stand for it,they will move on to their plans to keep scots oil.
They wont accept the will of the majority of Scottish voters that`s for sure

9312 2018-04-29 17:34:40 I fear that after the yes vote Westminster wont accept it and work to be two indy nations working side by side.
Instead they will make enemies of scots to keep our oil,scots don't want this,but is England mature enough to accept the result?,I would say not!
9313 2018-04-29 17:34:26 I just find it infuriating that our tax dollars are being used to help stop a huge project that not only has been approved at the federal level, but will create tax revenues and jobs for many and will also eliminate the need to import oil from inhuman regimes.
9314 2018-04-29 17:34:20 My preference would be oil dropper amount to put in my tea at night.      Do I need talk to my pcp to try it?

9338 2018-04-29 17:31:12 I am not saying you wrote it, I read the article in punch but I saw Wale Tinubu and Asiwaju's Picture was used. To me that's misleading. Whether Asiwaju has oil Bloc directly or by proxies that's not my problem. I am complaining base on the information given in the punch.

9343 2018-04-29 17:30:23 In Alberta too, there are rebates for lower income and money is to be invested in green industries.  Make sense to me.  We do need to grab the opportunity on the ground floor to develop alternative energy industries. Oil is a finite resource.
9344 2018-04-29 17:30:23 Insightful, but would you please establish the link between oil prices and the equity indices?
9345 2018-04-29 17:30:10 On a serious note though, JamaicanBlack Castor Oil works wonders
9346 2018-04-29 17:30:06 I think you can blame the 1% 
superrich, Wall Street, corporate America- those co’s who had no sense of ethics (think Enron), Oil & Gas industry, as some of the worst offenders. To target all Boomers is BS. We were the first gen to address issues destroying the environment...

9371 2018-04-29 17:25:59 Depends what they're for but I'd recommend new rather than reclaimed in a garden, no oil, creosote etc. on them. Manningham concrete and estate sawmill in Bradford do them for approx £15 each & deliver. Or can get 2nds from a place at thorp arch which are perfectly fine for £13
9372 2018-04-29 17:25:51 I love putting coconut oil in my coffee because it doubles as a chapstick for my dehydrated hungover dead flaky lips  #itsthelittlebasicbitchthings
9373 2018-04-29 17:25:40 .@theturner I heard you speak in Kitchener apx 7 yrs ago about your new book The Leap. I remember you saying, "You can only cross a chasm in one leap!" All in with renewable energy.
Didn't recognize you today on @CBCSunday. What changed, that you became an apologist for big oil?
9374 2018-04-29 17:25:40 Oh iya pake Shea Butter aja atau lip balm yg mengandung Shea butter. Bs jg pake lip oil.

9379 2018-04-29 17:25:18 Why is it so hot yet my oil paint doesnt dry a single bit :) i fucking hate it :)
9380 2018-04-29 17:25:03 You were out fighting against gas and oil companies? Sounds like at most you were punching the fuel pump at a filling station.
9381 2018-04-29 17:24:58 Basta beh dapat kahit anong product bilhin mo mapa facial wash, mask or gel lagi mong tingnan kung for lightening at pampawala ng pimple scars then pangminimize ng oil. Magtutulong-tulong na mga yan pero sa totoo lang kojic soap talaga pinaka effective (para sakin)
9382 2018-04-29 17:24:52 Yea, because listening to his ramblings are like nails across the black board, what is it you hear when that degenerate talks ?? Everyone hears obsession of grandeur and a snake oil saleman. I know i live in NY !! WE all know him as a Conman.

9384 2018-04-29 17:24:47 do you think a party that accepts money from private prisons and the NRA, drains funding from the public education system while spending millions on a “war” (that’s really about stealing oil from the middle east) and denies women their reproductive rights is much better?
9385 2018-04-29 17:24:39 What has been accomplished exactly? Roll back green initiatives to help oil and gas barons continue to make money while fucking up the planet?    cut taxes for your rich friends   allow racists to feel comfortable   lie so much that it desensitized this nation 
9386 2018-04-29 17:24:37 I was recently given a jar of ozone infused olive oil to heal wounds. You can't make this up!
9387 2018-04-29 17:24:33 I just learned that the calamus mentioned in the Bible was actually cannabis that was used to infuse the anonting oil that was used in the temple.

9390 2018-04-29 17:24:11 It seems like the news has become more focused on making money and entertaining that reporting real news the Western Media did not report that China started selling oil on the Shanghai Futurers Market March 25th 2018 which is why we are paying more for Gas in Canada.

9394 2018-04-29 17:23:51 Of course. But at the same time, we can't stay on fossil fuels which will ultimately destroy all life on the planet. Offshore oil extraction is killing off fish and polluting shrimp at an alarming rate.

9398 2018-04-29 17:23:39 I agree. Also add a class called auto ec so people will have some level of changing oil, tires, spark plugs.
9399 2018-04-29 17:23:35 Teach them basic automotive maintenance before the start driving; check & refill fluids, change the oil, check tire pressure and change a flat, replace filters, use jumper cables, etc.

9410 2018-04-29 17:22:48 I didn’t write the article. It was something I shared from punch for all interests. Asiwaju owns Oil Blocs directly and via proxies. But that’s a story for another day. References to this article however will made in due course thus the share.

9461 2018-04-29 17:16:10 I believe the correlation is stronger against oil exporting smaller economies like the Colombian Peso. With higher oil prices more dollars enter in their economy demanding more pesos and viveversa

9474 2018-04-29 17:13:40 We are fish  floating peacefully down a river, tigers clawing at us up and down the banks. Snake charmers and snake oil salesmen with greasy hair and demonic gleams in their eyes, are the sun light stinging our eyes  when we rise
9475 2018-04-29 17:13:32 Hear it from a long-time $TSLA bull: I agree with @AndurandPierre that Peak Oil Demand due to EV’s is 10+ years away.
9476 2018-04-29 17:13:31 So my brother gave me some cannibus oil and i been jy scared to use it lls but I Smoke everyday lls can u imagine
9477 2018-04-29 17:13:25 Alberta is a captive colony of the Oil Deep State. When in control of the Federal Government the Albertans infected every level of public service with Oil Deep State operatives. Canadians don't hate Albertans, they hate the Oil Deep State. It's hard to tell them apart.
9478 2018-04-29 17:13:07 Ray, I'm looking at the top 15 draft picks on tsn website, wondering who the oil should take at 10. The names I see around 10 are Dobson, Hughes, Hayton, Veleno, Smith, Kotkaniemi. Either centremen or dmen......you think Dobson or Hughes could be around at 10 as a dman pick?
9479 2018-04-29 17:13:04 None of the above. Just moving on because the whole thing had been a joke for years
9480 2018-04-29 17:12:57 Pretty sure im due for an oil change inno
9481 2018-04-29 17:12:51 Yo, spraying tea tree oil in water on your scalp when you’ve got dreads is soooooo refreshing, like damn, that felt good

I only use it on the boundary fencing. Use organic linseed oil on my house, deck and shed.
9487 2018-04-29 17:11:17 Protestors seem oblivious to 700,000 barrels a DAY coming down St Lawrence with oil from Saudi and   Venezuela..as does Trudeau and Climate Barbie
9488 2018-04-29 17:11:14 Keep it classy, it will piss them off even more.
9489 2018-04-29 17:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: day-old crust with wet coconut oil and cheese.
9490 2018-04-29 17:10:41 Looks like an oil painting.  (One I'd hang on my wall...)

9492 2018-04-29 17:10:28 @RRD_Davao With respect It seems you're a great leader though I implore you please consider utilizing cannabis as medicine if even regulated; it has many great benefits even aside from medicine such as oil , paper, and textiles. You have the recognition and support of a demi-god

9497 2018-04-29 17:10:01 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
9498 2018-04-29 17:10:01 visiting @POTUS  can only mean something to us if you makedecisions that will improve our economy positively. We need foreign investors and expertise to venture into agriculture and technology. This is what we need cos we cannot keep depending on cruel oil.

9505 2018-04-29 17:09:29 This is going to be a very intriguing draft with the Oil being where they are in the order. A part of me is excited, a bigger part of me is scared as to what PC does.
9506 2018-04-29 17:09:04 He is a leftist as so many from Norway are, but they are a population of just over 5 million. 5 MILLION! That’s the size of half the state of Virginia. I’m certain if our nation was so small and had the natural resources of oil in N Sea that Norway has, things would be dif.
9507 2018-04-29 17:09:03 The price of a gallon of gas and heating oil has gone up 10 cents in the past 2 weeks. Thanks a lot for the giant tax cut, #GOP. Fat lot of good that extra $100 does when I have to fill my tanks.
9508 2018-04-29 17:09:00 Car inspected 
Full oil change 
Car washed and vacuumed  

All before work yesssss
9509 2018-04-29 17:09:00 Seeming that I don’t think you understand what I’m saying I shall be frank. You joined and stared wars for the wrong reason money, end of, you chocked japan, a county that had done you no wrong of its oil and other supplies just so it would attack another county
9510 2018-04-29 17:08:54 As the third Gulf War (Iran/Saudi) is becoming more realistic, Nigeria needs to have a comprehensive strategy of negotiation with clear-cut takeaways that can navigate our economy away from oil dependence. It is important we use the available advantage to get the best for Nigeria

9516 2018-04-29 17:08:28 flying cars will never be commercial. people dont even get oil changes and regular maintenance on their cars right now.. if this shit ever went mainstream people would be running out of gas and crashing and chopping dudes like that helicopter that got Cpt. MacMillan in cod4

9520 2018-04-29 17:08:18 Olive oil cleanses for gallstones. Ice baths for ME/CFS. Homeopathy and oddly socialism for PTSD. Long walks  for agoraphobia. The usual yoga-veganism-exercise-prayer stuff I barely register now. None of it worked obviously…
9521 2018-04-29 17:08:13 @dominos_india My whole family loves your pizza & we order oftenly. Recently I saw a video circulated on social media which shows that you use some oil based thing instead of real cheese in order to offer low cost pizzas. I am surprised. Can you clarify?
9522 2018-04-29 17:08:10 Canada loses $10,000/yr for every man woman and child by selling our oil to the USA at a discount imagine how that could help all Canadians if politicians had a backbone

9529 2018-04-29 17:07:03 MCT oil is seriously the best pre workout.  I have tons of energy but I don’t feel cracked out.
9530 2018-04-29 17:07:01 It’s my own fault. LOL Plus, I forgot that # 1 was taking the car in to get tires & oil changed, so I’m on solo Bamm-Bamm duty for a few hours.
9531 2018-04-29 17:06:56 Well, I picked up candy, put on my comfy clothes, used some lavender oil for my headache, and am about to get a little bit stoned (medicinally, leave me alone!) so I'm ready to go see #InfinityWar with my siblings. I'm ready to get heartbroken in many ways. Let's get it!
9532 2018-04-29 17:06:52 Bellaire.  They are both out.  Was told oil & gas company cut a line in the mountains .  Bellaire is actually pretty good since they upgraded to faster speeds.
9533 2018-04-29 17:06:37 s their oil income. 
Mexico has some of toughest immigration laws in world, yet offer complete access to those traversing their country to illegally enter US.

9535 2018-04-29 17:06:00 I hate asking my grandma how to she makes her food. She’ll say sesame oil and I’ll ask how much and she will reply with “ much” 
9536 2018-04-29 17:05:55 In my opinion is only with smaller currencies like the Colombian peso to USD as their demand increases when the oil price increases and viceversa having a positive correlation
9537 2018-04-29 17:05:53 acnes face wash,toner clear and clear,scrub himalaya,bio oil(optional buat ngilangin bekas jerawat ampuh banget),acnol
9538 2018-04-29 17:05:53 It’s easier to convince people with taste. There’s a reason why fast food places advertise they fry with peanut oil and why that’s worth mentioning.

9542 2018-04-29 17:05:00 I went to get a massage and they asked if I wanted a happy ending. I said sure. But I had to ask for a refund afterwards because they didn’t shoot me in the head while I was blissed out on tea tree oil
9543 2018-04-29 17:04:59 It's $1.30 here too. WTF IS going on with the price of gas if the price of a barrel of oil has been constant? #PriceFixin
9544 2018-04-29 17:04:43 So we capitalize by spending millions more on top of all current oil subsidies so we can run unprocessed tar through pipes to our coast where large tankers will take this crud through some of the most dangerous waters on earth? Then we'll sell to an imaginary buyer? Seriously?
9545 2018-04-29 17:04:34 So a career in oil and world currencies makes you an expert?  we should just throw college away then, you’re right we don’t learn anything.

9628 2018-04-29 16:55:32 The squeaky wheel doesn’t always choose the oil. Sometimes you get a clear backpack and learn to enjoy it.
9629 2018-04-29 16:55:32 A European lady's van broke down and I troubleshooted that it could be her starter (battery was fine so it wasn't that or the alternator. Oil was low). Gave her and her elderly dog a ride to her sister's. I wanted so badly to ask what she thought of #Brexit #ImDyingToKnow

How can that not influence their output?
I'm done.
9633 2018-04-29 16:54:59 This day in history, April 29, 1976: The first cargo of North Sea oil was exported.
9634 2018-04-29 16:54:56 Yes!! They have a couple different brands but this brand is a clear bag with red writing! The ingredients are basically just flour, oil, salt lmao!
9635 2018-04-29 16:54:55 I'm 20 minutes in and it's reassuring to know I'm following the right trends. I've been trying to reach out to friends and family to educate them without sounding like a salesman with the latest snake oil product so I think this vid may do the trick!

9641 2018-04-29 16:54:42 All that I can say is that I am horrified. This snake oil salesman is preying upon the people who are vulnerable (just like the liar in chief at the WH). There should be a law against this. He will get his just dessert some day.

9649 2018-04-29 16:53:47 Five years ago price of gas was under 1$ a litre -- a barrel of oil over $120 USD.  Today it's $1.60 a litre and $68 USD a barrel.  What a joke -- and we're supposed to be happy that, actually, we have it Cheap compared to Europe - #SickOfTheScam!

9663 2018-04-29 16:52:03 With Trump in the WH, expect gas to get close to $5.00 gallon. It wont be long before he starts manipulating the oil prices for his buddies to get richer and the Americans get screwed harder. The theme with Trump : The harder you screw America the more you make and don't repay.
9664 2018-04-29 16:52:01 I liked getting called Redneck when I lived in Texas. Here in Illinois, they just look at me sideways.
9665 2018-04-29 16:51:46 There are more important things than $$.like destruction of this planet! We should be investing in solar & wind, alternatives to oil! Jesus dont these people ever learn! We've done enough damage, it's probably irreversible at this point, but we should b trying! Fuckers!
9666 2018-04-29 16:51:44 Difference is quite simple. Despite private companies existing. NHS exists as a right. It's an efficient (not perfect) important lifeline which is free at point of need. USA views the sick as a natural resource, which like oil, private companies can tap into to profit from upon.

9670 2018-04-29 16:51:05 Enough of repubs, allowing trump to ruin health care for young elderly. Giving away public lands, destroying environment, gutting epa/state dept, wildlife habitat, oil drilling the waters, wasting money to fly to FL, lying, not protecting mueller

9678 2018-04-29 16:49:57 The real threat is this insidious Davosian ploy to make #oil off-limits to institutional savngs pools, whether thru the chimaera of ‘Peak Demand’ or the Green Taliban ‘leave it in the ground’ schtick. #Carney heads the move to build this latter ‘financial stability’ Trojan Horse

9695 2018-04-29 16:48:23 It may not escalate to that level but the protesters better not act surprised if and when enough unemployed oil workers remove their sponsored blockades so that work can progress.
9696 2018-04-29 16:48:22 avoid using coconut hair oil

9698 2018-04-29 16:48:11 So would I, but I still know enough about an oil change to avoid getting scammed.
9699 2018-04-29 16:47:56 Technically, like I said gandoosha to be done is fr preventive aspect, n if you see the procedure of oil pulling it involves swishing of oil which is kavala in #Ayurveda gandoosha doesnt involve any movement, hence should be considered safer if done correctly

9709 2018-04-29 16:46:29 That's the “real” emission rate, of course. The fact that it's not the marginal rate is the reason I can justify to myself the financial decision to burn oil in my current accommodation, rather than use more electric heating.

9827 2018-04-29 16:33:43 "but they also pay high tax rates" is always left out by politicians here when comparing 'us' to 'them'. Norway sells their oil, has high taxes and provides " free college classes". If only everyone in US paid $7/gal for gas and 40% income tax, we too could have "free college".
9828 2018-04-29 16:33:31 One of the things that drives me nuts about politics is how the uneducated masses blame/praise governments for things out of said govt's control. Ie: the PCs drove the AB econ into ground, with the help of low oil prices and yet so many people blame the NDP govt for where...
9829 2018-04-29 16:33:30 for example. Based on positioning we should short the hell outta oil.

Is Genie Energy, which is operating in Golan Heights, giving the outcome of oil to Syrians?

9835 2018-04-29 16:32:49 You may be correct but the price received for Canadian oil will be much higher if we have markets other than the USA to ship to. The only difference will be the additional shipping cost using Aframax tankers which is much less than current discount. Do the math it’s basic. 1+1.
9836 2018-04-29 16:32:47 1/Well, Dave, you're the expert in that regard. But the context here is energy journalism, specifically reporting about TMX/AB oil sands. I've followed up on several of McKay's stories w/experts. Not just bad reporting, completely fallacious. The LOOP piece, for instance.

The costs of shipping smaller loads is more expensive and not competitive with tankers carrying 2M barrels.

9891 2018-04-29 16:26:13 He has obviously bad taste.
9892 2018-04-29 16:25:58 @iwight Waste disposal. Where can I dispose of oil from garden bamboo lights/lamps/flambo's please?  Lynbottom wouldn't accept.

9898 2018-04-29 16:25:30 The point is: ...All surplus countries are located on EuroAsia - EU, China, Russia, S.Korea, Oil producers...
...let it sink...
There are 3 trade giants: EU, USA, China who compete...
...Q...
Would you as US want EuroAsia to integrate and flourish?

9918 2018-04-29 16:23:23 Which Palestinians were doing in Palestine, long before Zionists turned their covetous eyes on Palestine and began the terrorization and murder of Palestinians for the homes,their land, their water and oil. Too bad the Int'l Community was so ineffective at protecting Palestinians

9920 2018-04-29 16:22:52 #sundayscrum  Damaging the environment w bitumen is NOT the way to make $$ properly.  @JustinTrudeau please apologize & adopt the environmentally correct choice of decreasing the use of the tar sands, not increasing the use.  Canadians have changed their feelings about oil.

9934 2018-04-29 16:21:42 I have been rejected three times this week by the fairer gender. The first one was in a petrol station. She was in newly done braids. Newly done braids always have that glow appeal about them. Like they have been dipped in oil for a lifetime. They are zesty and full of life.
9935 2018-04-29 16:21:33 Just don't put money into U.S.A, infested Canada, like Unions, or P.C. Party, or box stores, or pipelines, oil projects, mines. Time to push U.S.A. interest out of Canada and into Mexico! North America needs balance an equality, and that's what its going to take! PEACE 
9936 2018-04-29 16:21:30 Why? Because Goldman kept recommending short Oil when indeed price kept rising.

9941 2018-04-29 16:20:59 Hahaha...My brother I pray to leave and leave for good. This your country is being held up by oil. The change that was to set things right is tolling the same path as the previous. Everywhere is self interest, no nationalism.

9949 2018-04-29 16:20:11 No matter how many records they break and how beautiful their football is, city fans aside, people won't really care. Everything City do has a massive oil money asterisks beside it, whether thats fair or not.
9950 2018-04-29 16:20:09 Just stopped in at Northern Tool to pick up some 3:1 oil and they were playing The Cure’s Boys Don’t Cry. 

Help me out, what sort of woke-ass intersectionality is this?
9951 2018-04-29 16:20:04 Shameful, and yet there is always a program, an article, or a new book written in the US on the Holocaust, while this terrible ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by the apartheid state, Israel, operates with impunity, while it steals and murders for land, water and OIL.  Hypocrisy?

9983 2018-04-29 16:14:03 It is a very inexpensive place to live, a hard place to make a living. Farming and ranching was old model. Some oil activity made it a lot more viable. That is growing some, Texas oil production further West is really growing. Some huge production from very deep wells.

9986 2018-04-29 16:13:44 By the way - the KML expansion is a no-brainer, following essentially the same route as the existing pipeline. Energy East also used an existing pipeline to move oil East, which would have opened up markets & allowed use of Cdn oil instead of imported overseas oil by supertanker.
