38 2018-07-06 23:58:29 I’m still unsure if it’s just a total acceptance of mediocrity. Or Total delusion that the squad as constructed is as good as the elite teams. Or just content/happy with the idea of cheering on home team and don’t care enough to bother questioning irrational moves
39 2018-07-06 23:58:24 I am ashamed of all of these racist comments.Syria is not a free democratic country. It is ruled by a despot dictator. What parent would want to return his family to that terrible place?It was American foreign policy that destroyed the Middle East. All in an effort to secure oil.

57 2018-07-06 23:56:41 Nigel Lawson is such a cynical fucker. Created a mini-economic boom just for the 87 election, gave away North Sea Oil cash in tax breaks and poisoned any conversation about raising tax after that. Oh, and applying for European citizenship now too.

78 2018-07-06 23:53:25 I am glad to hear you will be voting conservative in the next election, to allow us to build Energy East so that the east coast refineries no longer need to import Saudi Arabian, Nigerian, Venezuelan, and Iranian Oil then.
79 2018-07-06 23:52:52 I fully recognize that it was the right move, but I have regrets around putting maze elements in this painting.

Look, painting straight lines free hand in oil is hard, y'all. Hard and time consuming. And my hand hurts. And I'm done whining.

84 2018-07-06 23:52:24 I asked u to put me in touch with someone you know personally.

99 2018-07-06 23:50:56 Sigh. Girl...it would be wise to wash & oil your hair then wash and set your wigs. Instead, you are sitting up here watching the @Indians and making light work of this bottle of Chardonnay. 

Lemme go wash Oprah, Nadia & Nina before I regret it.

102 2018-07-06 23:50:42 Pruitt was Teflon when he was carrying out Trump's policies and "owning the libs and environmentalists." Scandals piled up and it didn't matter. He stepped out of bounds once he gave oil refiners a break at the expense of farmers and ethanol producers.

104 2018-07-06 23:50:20 So we get rid of an oil industry shill lobbyist only to have him replaced by a coal industry shill lobbyist. Talk about marching back in time. That’s the Trump administration in a nut-ball shell.
105 2018-07-06 23:50:01 Q107: Appropriate behaviour for environmentalist breaking into oil storage facility (7)
106 2018-07-06 23:49:45 Yeah, apparently the oil available on prescription (but not the PBS, naturally) costs approx. $300 per day (for someone with minimal tolerance, BTW). So fair!

Second, sorry, I wasn't clear. She applies essential peppermint oil to her temples and forehead.
113 2018-07-06 23:48:54 Manufacturing jobs, in Ontario at least, were lost primarily because of the higher Canadian dollar which was due to rising oil prices. Over 10 years period we lost over 300000 manufacturing jobs.
114 2018-07-06 23:48:40 Funny how atheists become Christian in their expectations of fair and equal treatment. When they're wronged, they may lie about it, but they practice Christian laws regarding right and wrong, claiming it's just them being morally good, demanding every one else follow suit.

122 2018-07-06 23:46:57 Who cares what HR McMaster says, he's a war hawk. 

The sanctions on Russia aren't friendly, the 200-plus Russians killed in Syria isn't friendly, arming Ukraine opposition isn't friendly and increased shale oil production isn't friendly.
123 2018-07-06 23:46:44 Chef Gusteau cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with Silly Putty.
124 2018-07-06 23:46:40 You live in a country where hundreds of women lives  were not considered important enough to inform them of their own smear test results. You live in a country where the health service is a shambles while we make drugs worth billions from Cork yet don't allow a sick kid thc oil.
125 2018-07-06 23:46:32 Not just by itself...It did help remove dirt & excess oil. Basically just helped clear up anything blocking my pores causing breakouts.

132 2018-07-06 23:45:24 Gonna sound gross, but use something super moisturizing like coconut butter or olive oil, put it on your scalp and leave it for at least 15 mins.

Then wash it out with your standard shampoo, you might have to wash twice. While rinsing it out rub your scalp well to loosen flakes!
133 2018-07-06 23:44:36 These Senators are all from oil pipeline states. They all have an interest in propping up oil production to the detriment of solar, wind or other clean energy. So does Russia

144 2018-07-06 23:41:47 about 15 drops of peppermint oil mixed in water then spray around windowsill. Change to tea tree, lavender, cinnamon every so often to keep it effective.

Sorry to butt in, but my best friend suffers from migraines, and she uses peppermint oil--both for the aroma and the physical sensation. Seems to help her out quite a bit. =]
148 2018-07-06 23:41:14 These people are being paid for their anti-pipeline activities by the tides Foundation. Us oil companies who stand to lose billions are among the main donors to the tides Foundation. These people are literally paid shills us oil companies doing their dirty work. #moreyouknow

156 2018-07-06 23:40:03 After a year of stealing millions from us Pruitt resigns. @SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley supported this criminal. Now his coal lobbyists assistant in charge. More oil spills and polluted water destroying Iowa. Chuck and Joni are immoral corrupted scum @DMRegister
157 2018-07-06 23:39:59 On July 4 2018 China threw Venezuela a life line for their oil industry $5billion let's see where this goes

161 2018-07-06 23:38:15 It’s ok if you cook it until it dies and cover it in oil/butter/some kind of fat
162 2018-07-06 23:38:10 It is really the new oil ooohhh, the apps just dey chop all the money
163 2018-07-06 23:38:00 Very diversified. One thing is I don’t buy overpriced gold advertised on Fox. A better hedge against inflation is oil. Now yes you can invest and still be concerned that corporations in certain industries have too much control.
164 2018-07-06 23:37:55 Money and Zionism is the evil. Oil ... gold ... land... find peace take a deep breath  and know god will right their wrongs
165 2018-07-06 23:37:30 I don't mind sharing my car with Jeremy, but it's put so many miles, oil/filter changes, and a full new set of tires on my car the last six months

167 2018-07-06 23:37:29 Agreed, the tariffs will hurt. But the optics between the two are very different. Trump's tariffs = America First, whereas Waivers for refiners = oil and gas shill.
168 2018-07-06 23:37:29 Yes- in peanut oil

174 2018-07-06 23:35:48 Microwave first, cut into thinner slices, olive oil with salt and cayenne pepper then bake.  Timmy doesn’t like sweet potatoes but likes them this way.
175 2018-07-06 23:35:46 I’m in Utah. We have coal, uranium, natural gas, oil, solar and wind.
Most coal and uranium is shut down, just dealing with tailings (in the Colorado R. for example), and depositories for uranium waste (shipped by rail thru SLC, oh joy) Gas is going strong as is wind, solar.
176 2018-07-06 23:35:43 I made a kale salad with blackberries, peaches, almonds and feta cheese with olive oil & apple cider vinegar. Matt proceeded to say, “This is the best kale salad I’ve ever had in my life.” I’m so, so incredibly happy right now.

178 2018-07-06 23:35:35 is there an essential oil that evokes big dick energy? asking for a friend
179 2018-07-06 23:35:33 - add tea tree oil to your cleanser to help with acne
- don’t wear your hair in a ponytail when you have a headache
- shave with coconut oil
- use olive oil and sugar to make a lip scrub
- put tea bags in your bath
- use coconut oil as a hair mask
180 2018-07-06 23:35:23 The problem with the modern day snake oil salesman is that he actually believes in his product. A con man used to know he was a con man. Now he’s just crazy.
181 2018-07-06 23:35:07 Fun fact. Greenpeace & almost every other environmental organization receives $ from the tides Foundation. US Oil companies that stand to lose billions from Pipelines are some of the largest contributors to the tides Foundation. These people are literally paid Shills for us oil.
182 2018-07-06 23:34:30 "The Alberta Energy Regulator has internal estimates that the cost of cleaning up all Alberta’s oil industry will run to $260 billion, which could crush the finances of Alberta’s government." Will #taxpayers have to bail them out again? #abpoli #cdnpoli

184 2018-07-06 23:34:18 “Just tell us of any major project that is financed by the tax you collect?Karuma is funded on loan, Entebbe Highway is funded on loan, Jinja Bridge is funded on loan,Tororo - Mbale-Kumi-Soroti -Lira road is funded  by World Bank still on loan, Oil pipeline on loan from Total”
185 2018-07-06 23:34:06 Trump’s Tariffs have moved Chinese purchases of Soy from America to Russia. Also moving will be Chinese purchases of US exports of Oil and Gas over to purchasing from Russia. Putin benefits greatly! Did he ask his friend President Trump to start the Trade War to help Russia?

188 2018-07-06 23:33:50 Went to get my nails done, came back home with a bag full of essential oil samples 
189 2018-07-06 23:33:29 You really need to get your facts straight before you post something. These things live forever on the internet. Maybe you need more snake oil. Our repugnant President is selling a boatload. And I hear it’s really cheap. Although I’m sure he pays no sales tax.
190 2018-07-06 23:33:28 Faith: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness-Gal 5:22

The manifestation of the Holy Spirit in our lives is the oil that must keep the lamp of God burning within us until Christ return
191 2018-07-06 23:33:16 Lol nothing really. But for a guy who was so hot it was pretty much annoying, he never really capitalized like other dudes did outside of a few commercials... or unless his name is somewhere on that random oil field somewhere.
192 2018-07-06 23:32:52 I will likely go another direction with the Olive Oil. In Bentonville there is a shop that is all gourmet olive oils. I'll likely go there and get them to recommend one for those ingredients.
193 2018-07-06 23:32:50 Castor oil is the best oil bitch
194 2018-07-06 23:32:43 Those are MEN who knows their onions, tomatoes, pepper and vegetable oil when it comes to political stew!

201 2018-07-06 23:31:42 I’m so proud myself I dedicated 30 long minutes to sitting at this fuckinggggg dealership for a oil change wtf
202 2018-07-06 23:31:10 I use Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating wash and their oil free moisturizer. Every once in a while I’ll use their alcohol free toner to keep my skin clear but not too often bc I’ll get dry patches.
203 2018-07-06 23:31:06 mama got her castor oil mhmmmmm
204 2018-07-06 23:31:03 The government of El Salvador has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Kristen Wiig in a cheesecloth wig.
205 2018-07-06 23:30:53 Oh kalau night routine ni aku tak discipline sangat  semalam bio oil je. Yess
206 2018-07-06 23:30:36 I wonder why a 3pack of microwave popcorn (300 grams) is 12 NOK, while a bag of normal unpopped (400 grams) is 24 NOK. I am not getting twice the corns, and have to supply oil and salt myself.
207 2018-07-06 23:30:10 I just learned how to change a tire and do an oil change by myself and I've never felt more accomplished
208 2018-07-06 23:30:04 Nothing like paying 150 for a oil change because you have a foreign
209 2018-07-06 23:29:57 Watermelon, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, mint, lime, feta cheese. You’re welcome 
210 2018-07-06 23:29:52 I thought Pruitt drank motor oil.
211 2018-07-06 23:29:43 You mean diversification of project A into project B is a bad thing? Is this why oil companies buy each other’s stocks? Your example is more than extreme. Also I have not seen ICOs do this.. it against the money grab culture.. also poor game theory
212 2018-07-06 23:29:43 They’re a lot of fun to make and set off!  I still have a lot of material, I want to do it again!  Just remember, I don’t think you can use wax crayons, so use oil based crayons, or you can use fabric dye.  Any stump remover from any hardware store, and baking soda!

218 2018-07-06 23:29:08 so very sorry, I am praying for your son. The FDA just approved a CBC oil that is very promising for seizures, I hope they are able to help your son. Godspeed
219 2018-07-06 23:29:00 Some beautiful wood. I was wondering what does hemp oil smell like? I know a great many of the oils used on wood finishing have rich comforting smells
220 2018-07-06 23:28:54 They even have a distinct NZ accent in their song. Yet oil industry bombards them with underwater sonic booms looking for oil that will cause catastrophic climate change if burnt
221 2018-07-06 23:28:39 yes I know my car has 500 problems but I have no money so please just change my oil and leave me alone 
222 2018-07-06 23:28:33 Really ?
Where is your PSA about the thousands of bird species who fly to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to breed ????????

You & Trump got the law passed that allows oil and gas cos( Trumps big $$ election donors) to drill in the Refuge.
223 2018-07-06 23:28:21 I read all about australia try j ng to deny Timor at time! It was disgraceful Timor was so poor Australia rich country but Howard fought tooth & nail to retain that oil but in end had to give in! How disgraceful was he to sanction all of this disgrace?
224 2018-07-06 23:28:09 I live in the countryside. I have a wood burner in the sitting room, it just hurts every time i gave to buy oil to burn
225 2018-07-06 23:28:08 And his pockets deeper than an oil well.

228 2018-07-06 23:27:55 The guy succeeding Pruitt is a coal lobbyist who will most likely continue Trump's theme of rolling back environmental protections in favor of big oil, gas & coal, thereby further enriching the 1℅, while discouraging investment in clean tech.

The environment is still screwed.
229 2018-07-06 23:27:52 Fellas your lady oil up her feet, you fuckin her feet or naw?
230 2018-07-06 23:27:44 1) Wall Not started. 2) trump promised total Muslim ban, not just 5 countries.   5) nafta not done until it’s done 6) Obamacare lives, no new plan 7) promised to renegotiate w/ Iran. Didn’t do it. 10) promised to get isis oil. That’s in Russia’s hands now.  Almost a total bust.
231 2018-07-06 23:27:41 Oil is the product of dead dinosaurs, I believe. Sinclair, marketing their earthly remains, chose a dinosaur for its logo.
232 2018-07-06 23:27:13 He's been doing this for ages now in an attempt to seem "refined". If only the oil that oozes from his every pore were so. Very bathetic.
233 2018-07-06 23:27:03 FG Seeks for downward review of Crude Oil Production Cost
234 2018-07-06 23:26:08 High dose of CBD OIL. The FDA just approved for epilepsy. Many have found dramatic results
235 2018-07-06 23:26:05 Whats worse: Hot oil sparkling on ur hand or stabbin ur toe on the edge of the table  #relatable
236 2018-07-06 23:25:57 FYI we dont need foreign Oil.  We export oil, we produce so much. If Trump was concerned with prices he would demand oil and gas produced on US Soil, which is what we use, prices be held steady & Not  increase with the prices of international oil and gas
237 2018-07-06 23:25:45 I got lavender oil to get rid of my spider problem. I put that shit everywhere. It smells lovely. If I see one fucking spider I’m suing the color lavender
238 2018-07-06 23:25:36 im so happy because i used to come home smelling like garlic and oil but now i smell like coffee beans and its a beautiful thing really
239 2018-07-06 23:25:25 Dude really drove from san Leandro to get oil change at my work in cupertino. Then he said be careful its a lil hot ..
240 2018-07-06 23:25:24 トイレで聞いた驚愕な台詞:｢ヒール履かない女は女に非ず｣…でも、実験はハイヒール不可。oil bathひっくりかえしたり、硫酸どばぁしたら危ないでしょ。お洒落よりも安全第一です。
241 2018-07-06 23:25:23 Today was pay day, and a car payment, speeding ticket, phone bill, insurance, a full tank of gas and oil change later I have $32.57 to my name.... so uh Unless your plans involve digging through my couch cousins with me for spare change, I’m busy.
242 2018-07-06 23:25:08 Nutox cleansing oil and Muji cleansing oil. Right after you gonyoh oil tu kat muka terus guna cloth tu. then cuci muka macam biasa guna cleanser.
243 2018-07-06 23:25:07 This is one of those times I get immense satisfaction out of making a normally off-limits food friendly for those with food allergies. Rice milk, palm shortening, and canola oil were easy substitutes.

251 2018-07-06 23:23:52 Change of subject. What should  Bashar al-Assad do?
Go back to London and continue his studies in Ophthalmology. 
What to do about the Middle East? Solar power. When no one needs oil, no one will want that useless piece of desert. Go Elon Musk, keep up your good work.

254 2018-07-06 23:23:22 Great post echoes with insights from Recent freedom from big oil. Would love to connect ping?
255 2018-07-06 23:23:20 *stares at oil paints* ...I need Kings Blue...

Do i get the amazon prime Williamsburg for $20, the Old Holland that's $3 more, or that $37 set with lots of 11ml mini bottles...

257 2018-07-06 23:23:15 Followed all I didn't have.
258 2018-07-06 23:23:13 An overwhelming number of commodities, like oil and metals, are priced in greenbacks. If China sold off a batch of Treasury, it would find plenty of buyers
259 2018-07-06 23:23:05 I’m afraid there’s more trump’s headed toward doing. Like creating a massive depression while Putin licks his chops in glee and trots off to his private bank with Xi and their oil pipelines everywhere including our public lands and reservations. New world order? Ya think?
260 2018-07-06 23:22:50 I once watched a guy lick a loyalty card clean so I was able to scan it... It was caped in oil n god knows what else. Literally gagged at the till.

If you say “raise up lights” you just said “razor blades” in an Australian accent. Now try saying “Well Oil Beef Hooked”.

270 2018-07-06 23:21:19 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
271 2018-07-06 23:20:56 It's meatballs, cheese and olive oil soaked bread. If you can't see the appeal of that on some base, instinctual level, I can't help you.
272 2018-07-06 23:20:52 are bananas really going extinct or is it just us going bananas about it. Oil rising, heat rising, article says truck melts in England due to heat, did not see the article, but is it the only truck, is it the tires? could it be the tires are not that resistant and worn out,Articl

275 2018-07-06 23:20:29 Their wealth is filthy with oil.
276 2018-07-06 23:20:15 because in america, the current party in control doesn't believe it is a thing that exists. they're coincidentally also funded largely by coal and oil. just look up the guy from the EPA that just resigned, and all the shit they were doing to dismantle regulations
277 2018-07-06 23:20:01 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
278 2018-07-06 23:19:55 Piddling amounts of online sales taxes versus the oil companies paying nothing. Bull crap.
279 2018-07-06 23:19:45 When you have over time in your check and you’re like sweet, then your suv needs a new belt tensioner,oil change & tire rotation, your water bill is due and your puppy gets spayed next week  *jamaican voice this is bullshit mon

284 2018-07-06 23:19:19 Sounds like the lemmings who followed Jim Jones back in the day. The only difference is today it's a grifter selling snake oil.
285 2018-07-06 23:19:09 Those people who eat up your lies and listen to you insulting other people will one day opening up their eyes. Maybe not all but some will. Then they will see you for the snake oil salesman you really are. And that you don't care about them. They will feel like Puerto Rico.

290 2018-07-06 23:18:38 Dude, your party cheers oil in all forms all the time and wants to deregulate anything to do with it, including rail safety, so perhaps spare us your "thoughts" - you sound like the GOP after a gun massacre. #cdnpoli
291 2018-07-06 23:18:31 Haha. Toss a little Oil Can Boyd in there for good measure!
292 2018-07-06 23:18:29 Baby oil
293 2018-07-06 23:17:59 Right?! You would think a company that just does oil changes could, you know, do it correctly.
294 2018-07-06 23:17:52 Cod liver oil caps?
295 2018-07-06 23:17:40 The Mullahs would have the IRG shut down shipping lanes themselves JUST to raise oil prices & zcrew-over 'The Great Satan'. Even though it would (further) screw over OWN people. The ones not already dead or in prison or starving. Wouldn't be the 1st time they've done that.

301 2018-07-06 23:16:19 I don't consume anything with soy beans, oil, etc......VERY sure not to.  If men keep doing it, they will grow moobs.  Think I'm nuts?  Look it up.  "Too much soy men".  If not, it's on you.  Say anything negative, F you anyway!
302 2018-07-06 23:15:53 Yeah! Any salad dressing. I like a simple white balsamic + olive oil dressing, sometimes adding dijon mustard or black pepper
303 2018-07-06 23:15:44 You should be able to get both types of tomatoes there! The olive oil I order from PennMac in Pgh. If you find paesano brand at Home Goods get that!! It’s close! Great also for dipping!!
304 2018-07-06 23:15:03 try almond oil for moisture. then clean it with Dickinson’s.
305 2018-07-06 23:14:25 Don’t forget tomatoes in the sauce, olive oil. Pizza is a well rounded food!
306 2018-07-06 23:14:18 First of all, I should not be getting my oil change! This what my nigga should be doing 
307 2018-07-06 23:13:54 Oil fans chirping about JT making  too much money. I’d rather have a single JT than a Lucic, 4x4 and Ryan Strome all locked up for 13.5. Worry about McMuffin staying healthy cause without that you go from 27th to 31st, plugs

319 2018-07-06 23:11:35 Trick question. Cod Liver Oil has done wonders for @ThisisLukeOwen and @OliDavis 
This is evident to anyone with open eyes.
320 2018-07-06 23:11:22 How much is the oil industry paying you to write this? Do you understand how expensive gas would be if we included the full cost of environmental damage in the price?
321 2018-07-06 23:11:21 He'll continue trumps apocalyptic merica view, and make sure his big money interests in the coal, oil, and pesticide industries are handsomely rewarded in exchange for lots of taxpayer money, polluted air, and un-drinkable water for many generations to come...

327 2018-07-06 23:10:44 Come on big fella, how much further do we go in debt each year as a result of these unbalanced trade arrangements? We may not feel it now, but someday our kids or theirs will. As for gas prices, drill baby drill. Last I checked, we’re not buying any oil from China, Mexico or EU.

331 2018-07-06 23:10:19 Does this one burn a quart of oil every 1,000 miles like my '14 CR-V does?? And if I purchase it, when something breaks under warranty, am I responsible for paying the entire repair cost or just most of it? #AskingForAFriend #NotReally

335 2018-07-06 23:09:42 I found some leftover soy mix in the fridge which I used as a base for a pork sauce and made a dirty wrap... But it had kale and kohlrabi in it so that makes it healthy. If you think about it, almost vegan... Garlic, chilli and oil are also vegetables...
336 2018-07-06 23:09:32 The US being paid by Saudis and Emaratis for the services rendered. SA and UAE are buying 100's of $billions in arms, buying many $billions in US bonds, increasing oil production,  etc. Trump does not care about human rights.Just $. Sad and shameful!! #Yemen

340 2018-07-06 23:08:53 Most UK and Scottish companies in the oil/gas sector are service providers.  Signing up to a goods-only Brexit plan as May is proposing is completely barking. It will do enormous damage to the NE of Scotland.

347 2018-07-06 23:07:47 Oh yeah I know, this was an indirect to those who say that. Coconut oil for acne is soooo baaaad 
348 2018-07-06 23:07:34 @SenatorCollins How many people's lives will be affected by trusting a Trump nominee for SCOTUS. Check how many lies Trump tells in a week, what his "best people" hire "Pruitt did to the EPA all for $$ for oil,gas,coal industries regardless of effects on our environment.

351 2018-07-06 23:06:58 Tell me, why do YOU think Pruitt's Trump-picked replacement is a former oil lobbyist?

Is that "draining the swamp"?   Is that not a direct and obvious conflict of interest?  I'm fascinated how you manage to twist your brain to justify open corruption.
352 2018-07-06 23:06:55 Other people’s marriages and feminism are oil and water. When it’s all said and done, that man promised you, not me.
353 2018-07-06 23:06:40 My face oil is just outta control
354 2018-07-06 23:06:39 6/n Unlike commodities required by industries (e.g. Crude Oil) there is very limited "intrinsic" demand for bitcoin. Most demand is for speculative purposes. That makes demand very elastic to supply changes. The more elastic demand is, the less influential supply shocks are.
355 2018-07-06 23:06:39 Facial oil is the greatest thing you can literally feel your skin go yaaaaaaaaaas
356 2018-07-06 23:06:30 They have more oil than anyone and they do this to their people!

364 2018-07-06 23:04:34 That is wrong on so many levels.  How many AFVs do you think are sold in the US vs gasoline vehicles? LOL  Has nothing to do with the price of gas - which is related to the price & quantity of oil - WORLDWIDE.  LOL  Read some before you reply back please.
365 2018-07-06 23:04:21 That’s an idea. Drill more drainage holes. I wonder how well they know the cave. Is there sonar equipment that can “see” through rock? There are services in Oil & Gas that use technology to find where to drill...
366 2018-07-06 23:04:17 After the 34 million in tariffs from China on Soybeans, oil and car manufacturing Trump Supporters will still blame:

373 2018-07-06 23:01:43 Kenneth when you try to proselytize me, you insult my intelligence. It's not impressive or any more legitimate than a 19th century snake oil salesman on the back of a buckboard.

Don’t throw food onto heated oil in the pan

378 2018-07-06 23:01:18 Cuz all they care about is building his  buildings from Russia to Venezuela, wherever the oil money is, because that’s why he is there. He’s wasting taxpayer money pretending to be for coal. OMG. Where is my milk delivered to my porch by horse, on this hot day?
379 2018-07-06 23:01:10 Have you ever thought about trying CBD oil?

383 2018-07-06 23:00:21 1. Okay remember that peak oil narrative for years?  Remember the narratives of China eclipsing the USA economy pushed for the last decade or two?  Yeah see these are examples of the media having their head up their ass.
384 2018-07-06 23:00:21 Eventually, real technology like fusion will replace oil efficiently but right now that technology is an illusion
385 2018-07-06 23:00:01 There are a few similar stories re automobile advancements over the years being suppressed by big oil etc and I oft wondered if there was any truth in the stories. Perhaps there is.
386 2018-07-06 22:59:30 Fucking oil popped on my foot 
387 2018-07-06 22:59:25 Does anybody else always feel like they have no idea what is going on during an oil change. What is my mileage? Do I want my lights checked? What is my name? I don’t know!

391 2018-07-06 22:59:00 if you pull up 10 minutes before we close and the only thing you say to me is "oil change" you arent getting that shit changed here boy 
392 2018-07-06 22:58:49 Remember how Ezra Levant’s “Ethical Oil” changed how we all talk about the tar sands?

His racist Rebel Media has been campaigning non-stop against refugees & asylum seekers for years, and I guarantee you that it is shaping the @OntarioPCParty & @CPC_HQ rhetoric on this issue.
393 2018-07-06 22:58:45 @MarkDohner did you use oil for the eggs
394 2018-07-06 22:58:38 Stop using creams with chemicals. Make a face mask 1tsp cinnamon & 2tsp honey. 
You can apply teatree oil on the pimples with cotton bud, not too much. And aloe vera gel is good too, you can leave it on the skin overnight.
395 2018-07-06 22:58:15 President Donald Trump said on August 11, 2017 that he was "not going to rule out a military option" in Venezuela, but the idea was one Trump had already mentioned to advisers #trump #venezuela #crude #oil #southamerica #invade #colonel #refugees #mkt

397 2018-07-06 22:57:37 Hi @realDonaldTrump . They are right! The more you pushing #Iran, the higher #oil prices will be! Stop it, you are businessman! Just do business! Trade, work, create, innovate!
398 2018-07-06 22:56:52 The oil industry,including Koch bros, need to be sued.
399 2018-07-06 22:56:51 The olive oil snob has logged on.

401 2018-07-06 22:56:38 I had a dream that my dad threw me into an open pit oil pond and then somebody lit it on fire. I had to crawl out and water bend all of the snow surrounding it to put out the fire. Then forest elves got mad and chased us until they trapped us and started poking my feet with forks
402 2018-07-06 22:56:37 To those that might happen know; what is this oil that you find people using in porn movies/videos/ clips?
403 2018-07-06 22:56:31 Lol... Same same... But the diesel one you can give benefit of the doubt... In many countries, crude oil actually springs from the ground... But it's crude oil not diesel...
404 2018-07-06 22:56:22 I am so happy to see there are children's books for this!  Its not always easy to explain certain things to my kids..especially since we recently moved from CO to MO. They see it as adult medicine, and they respect that; but they do take hemp CBD oil. 
405 2018-07-06 22:55:50 I have heard cbd oil is very helpful!
406 2018-07-06 22:55:30 I am campaigning for the US Presidency, oil Wells are always under pressure since the oil is a hydraulic ballast to support the Earth's surface and sub surface lands. Hydraulic fracturing weakens the customer and Its ability to support structures.
407 2018-07-06 22:55:13 Snake oil can often be an invoiceable commodity...
408 2018-07-06 22:55:06 Some light oil can fix that too.
409 2018-07-06 22:55:05 But you know what? Her “oil tycoon” friend is totally right. The super wealthy are going to town under this admin. He&his cabinet members totally upcharging taxpayers &trying to sell off all the public lands/schools/roads/prisons to his buddies.
410 2018-07-06 22:55:02 should've used some castor oil... cause he's fulla 
411 2018-07-06 22:55:02 Ummm, oil receives 100+ year-old tax subsidies. Ending that BS would be a good start, electric cars still have 70 or so years to catch up to oil subsidies.
412 2018-07-06 22:54:55 #tytlive The Trump administration have convinced his supporters that coal & oil are "renewable" resources making wind & solar unneeded...
413 2018-07-06 22:54:42 I love making my kids popcorn at home. About 1/3 cup of good popping corn and some quality oil and I can feed them for a weekend!
414 2018-07-06 22:54:34 A) Venezuela isn’t socialist. It’s a form of state capitalism. More specific, it’s a a petro state that has suffered over recent years from the reduction in oil prices (half its economic output is based on oil exports). As for the USSR, its form of socialism is not the
415 2018-07-06 22:54:30 I once heard a white person give the utterly ridiculous excuse for not swimming in the public pool with black folks: the use lots of coconut oil on their skin and it makes the water oily...

425 2018-07-06 22:53:19 I believe in climate change, but I don't believe in taxing the poorest people to fix it. It come be solved long  ago. we have put people on the moon robots explore mars land a robot on a comet but we can't get oil lmao you all just want to bleed us dry.
426 2018-07-06 22:53:17 Meanwhile, in Russia, 8 senators are continuing to conspire with Russia to lift sanctions and make the biggest oil deal in history, and Trump will get his next orders from Putin in Helsinki soon.
427 2018-07-06 22:52:41 Calendula. You could make calendula salve. Take a look at Practical Self Sufficiency by @dickstrawbridge and @eco_boy, it has a good recipe. It's medicinal, uses bees wax and olive oil.

431 2018-07-06 22:52:21 I just read that sea buckthorn solidifies at room temp so it’s a thicker oil which is good for locking in moisture especially with hyaluronic acid bc it’s a humectant but if your skin is already combo to oily I’d say using less is a good idea
432 2018-07-06 22:52:00 I have a somewhat loose tooth happening. But really, it's barely loose. It has some issues, obviously, but I think I can get away with a few more years on this thing if I change its oil every few thousand chews.
433 2018-07-06 22:51:36 He eats coal for breakfast and poops oil but how is he going to get Federal Employees to wash his balls and put lotion on them now that he quit ?

443 2018-07-06 22:49:39 Don’t take credit for tourism. Back then there was a massive oil spill and a worldwide Financial Crisis. You consistently gave tourism massive funding without oversight. You funded tourism advertising with zero accountability. You made sure all new jobs were minimum wage.

451 2018-07-06 22:48:59 A big part of people don't eat fish and don't eat flax or walnuts either so they don't get enough. Some of them take fish oil. Why not just take algae instead of fish and skip the bad stuff?
452 2018-07-06 22:48:38 got the water drained out of my truck box too bad I still have winter oil... I'll be camping in style this year since I haven't camped in several years it ought to be fun 
453 2018-07-06 22:48:36 My son also suffers from epilepsy and I also am fighting to get him the oil to replace the awful 12 pills a day he must take to control them. Unfortunately North Carolina prevents it. Bless him and may God wrap his healing arms around him and all others who suffer. 
454 2018-07-06 22:48:30 Like oil and water. Noles always rise to the top!

458 2018-07-06 22:47:42 yea, I use it to moisturize my scalp mixed with some drops of tea tree oil, I love the smell of lavender + olive oil
459 2018-07-06 22:47:41 I buy metal parts. I own an oil company. Every Taiwan piece of crap connectors fail after a month or so. Fittings degrade and fall apart. The structured ears to hold in place gets worse, and start to leak since they are not real steel. My American ones I’ve had for years

461 2018-07-06 22:47:24 if the baking soda dont work...add vinegar... or use a lil bleach but make sure to thoroughly rinse your hands afterwards then moisturise with oil
462 2018-07-06 22:47:21 @realDonaldTrump I'm comfortable with the sanctions and I know that you will not be exempted from any sanctions on oil, and I'm sure that Iran's oil will be cut 100% by November. President Trump Some people in the United States say about the opposition
463 2018-07-06 22:47:15 White Christians evangelicals are haters and killers, thats what they did to Native Americans and others in their way. Puritans came to America over persecution than drown ed, filled w/hot oil and burned at the stack women accused of witchcraft.

473 2018-07-06 22:46:10 ok this sounds weird but try making your own!!!! use orange essential oil & an unscented carrier oil!!!!!!!
474 2018-07-06 22:46:02 But like maybe not smoking it like u can just use the oil in tablets n stuff
475 2018-07-06 22:45:47 That's a joke. Oil prices started to rise months ago & anyway Iran is far to be one of the main producers of Oil. It's just the perfect scapegoat for Trump's electorate who don't get a shit about world geostrategie.

481 2018-07-06 22:44:34 It’s all about oil... and greed.

483 2018-07-06 22:44:10 I never had any of these symptoms. 
But excess MCT oil creates some pretty sporty tummy issues. 

I fast as well! Love it. What’s your schedule?
484 2018-07-06 22:44:07 Well have you checked your oil or coolant levels?
485 2018-07-06 22:43:55 Rah jsjsjsjjsjsjsjsjsjs. I don’t want to argue with you - I’ve just put my scalp through an intensive 3 months castor oil rehab. You can’t be snatching my wig like this again. Bye.
486 2018-07-06 22:43:20 Some personal news: I’ve rejoined the oil industry as a geologist for CalFrac here in Houston! I’ll be training in Calgary for the rest of the month. Real Estate has been fun and I’ll still do it on the side — but after 2 years it’s exciting to be back in the oil patch.

490 2018-07-06 22:42:51 Oil refineries?
491 2018-07-06 22:42:50 Its National Fried Chicken Day. In order to make it, chicken is usually cut at the joints into smaller pieces. Skin and bones are left on, them coated in batter, which is made of ingredients such as eggs, milk, flour, and seasoning then its fried in oil.
492 2018-07-06 22:42:37 I am pretty sure must be a lot of patents acquired by oil industry bigwigs and basically buried.
493 2018-07-06 22:42:08 Lol I think it’s oil. To be honest tho....I don’t remember.

Jesus I’ve taken my shirt off a lot on TV....I’m a dink.
494 2018-07-06 22:41:59 They done offered a new person to braid his hair, they changing his oil on that Tahoe for him, they doing whatever lol
495 2018-07-06 22:41:34 #OOTT #Oil 
As mentioned last Sunday, holding #WTI long positions during current uncertainty is akin to a suicidal action. #US Oil has been moving in a very volatile style. A daily trading range of more than 100 pt each way has become the norm of oil markets now.
496 2018-07-06 22:41:30 Saudi Arabia slashing prices on barrel of oil and Germany open to lowering the tariffs on US imported cars but damn does this country suck with Trump as our president. Libs stay mad at nothing
497 2018-07-06 22:41:26 Actually it converts good enough for our needs. When you eat plenty of nuts and seeds, get enough other nutrients (which vegans get more of), don't use sunflower oil the body gets better at converting LNA into EPA, into DHA. The few people that can't, can have algae supplements.
498 2018-07-06 22:41:26 My UK mobile is on PPI & car accident sucker list, I keep chatting & agreeing to buy their snake oil. I use algorithm to generate credit card detail that is accepted by them.

Yes it is.

523 2018-07-06 22:37:59 recipes. Vodka sauce..add 1-2 lbs Italian sausage. 1/2-1 c of vodka at the end let it cook off. Add 1 c of 1/2 & 1/2. Toss pasta in romano cheese and then toss in sauce. I use San Guiliano Alghero Olive Oil!!
524 2018-07-06 22:37:59 Just found a random ass eyelash that i grew, so looks like the castor oil is working 
525 2018-07-06 22:37:36 Re the oil and gas decision, there was not mention of this in the election campaign, and on thrity six percent of the voter, there is no mandate for it. Huge decision without the majority on board. Shows the dangers of the numpty MMP system.

This doesn't excuse the millions of people killed directly / indirectly through various terrorists created to serve the agenda...you have outdated Western ideas, the world knows
527 2018-07-06 22:36:48 It’s like taking yer car 2 a retarded mechanic 4 an oil change & them replacing yer brakes (incorrectly); changing yer timing belt (incorrectly); breaking yer entire stereo/electronics systems; denting & scratching yer car; removing your transmission; and then TIPPING THEM.

533 2018-07-06 22:36:16 Another option is 1/2-2/3 c good olive oil...crushed garlic and red pepper flakes. Warm and add 3-5 c Cento crushed tomatoes or Pomi strained. Add a can of paste if necessary to thicken. Kosher salt. I cook for an hour or over night. I use this as base for other
534 2018-07-06 22:36:13 me: olive oil

544 2018-07-06 22:35:40 I love this portable car oil diffuser i have  it’s amazing & makes my truck smell so good!
545 2018-07-06 22:35:31 I would too, true CBD does not have any High effect. It's probably Rick Simpson Oil that you're smoking, not true CBD
546 2018-07-06 22:35:22 And all we get out of it is less dependence on foreign oil markets and gasoline  price-fixing and clean air.

560 2018-07-06 22:32:40 Haha tbf drowning in oil sounds worse than drowning in water!
561 2018-07-06 22:32:40 Saudi Aramco the largest energy company in the world worth $2trillion is selling 5% shares for $100billion to diversify from oil the biggest ipo in history. NNPC should be ashamed
562 2018-07-06 22:32:40 I have a somewhat loose tooth happening. But really, it's barely loose. It has some issues, obviously, but I think I can get away with a few more years on this thing if I change its oil every few thousand chews.

583 2018-07-06 22:29:30 Benn was right in the 70s. That's half a lifetime away. We have grown from sick man of europe to top dog and we're rapidly getting sick. not because of EU or Germany, but because of some unicorn fantasy the country got flogged by snake oil salesmen
584 2018-07-06 22:29:09 I am looking for a marijuana company that has all connections for venue of different aspects. Land, growers, distribution,  oil for regular but especially for CBD oil. The. next accounts will be pharmacies and grocery stores and 7/11 type stores when they pass the farm bill.

588 2018-07-06 22:28:21 Short week is over. It was a good week overall. Short small sp position over the weekend from 2755. Using a 2770 stop out. Oil trade was good this week. Expect the same in the week to come. Watching for news over the weekend. Will be back Sunday night. Enjoy your weekend !
589 2018-07-06 22:28:12 Their oil ? As long as they pay their share of the debt
590 2018-07-06 22:27:59 They aren't even using new tactics. If Republicans pulled similar tactics the MSM would fry them in oil!
591 2018-07-06 22:27:56 the slip n slide broke so they made one and this child goes down with olive oil
592 2018-07-06 22:27:47 bout to mini spa it up with the good scents, an Indian clay mask,  and warm coconut oil to moisturize with after

598 2018-07-06 22:26:50 That’s funny! I happen to live in the country, wow, a gravel road right past my driveway. Yields and stop signs at every intersection. Saw I sign yesterday, said “slow fresh oil” that’s to stop some of the dust, in case you didn’t know.

603 2018-07-06 22:26:00 You know it’s hot when the coconut oil melts and becomes full liquid in a glass jar
604 2018-07-06 22:25:20 Not really, as the middle eastern oil barons not considered. Ps. @MarkZuckerbe1rg only worth that on paper because of all the idiots buying fakebook worthless stocks.........
605 2018-07-06 22:25:13 35 year old brake check employee, please stop flirting with me and asking me to give you a back rub im just trying to get my oil changed for fucks sake
606 2018-07-06 22:25:07 Trade war, diplomacy, N. Korea, Iran, sex scandals, cabinet appointments, immigration, taxes, coal, offshore oil drilling...even spelling.
607 2018-07-06 22:24:54 Government own the industry like mexico and the oil company.
608 2018-07-06 22:24:41 It’s all of them. The whole system. Their flawed political ideologies. Their political parties. They rely on federal funds like the US relies in crude oil. And that’s the only game in town.

611 2018-07-06 22:23:38 Certain Birth controls help. My acne has gotten better with the Sunday Riley miracle oil (so expensive) and i use differin.
612 2018-07-06 22:23:31 No matter who rules, the bloodshed will still continue. Some elites in the north are behind these killings, that is their own oil well.
613 2018-07-06 22:23:24 Give them their own medicine!! Castor oil!!
614 2018-07-06 22:23:17 @TheKitchenista I think I learned something. Up north. BBQ. Roast loin of pork and lamb. Standard roast prep - salt, pepper, oil, tons of rub. I put them back in the fridge for a few hours. Cooked on indirect/direct heat. Beautiful. The fridge stage is unexpectedly important.
615 2018-07-06 22:23:12 @VP Tell Trump he can stop the coal fire in Pennsylvania by fracking it,like on oil rig holes,pump it with water
616 2018-07-06 22:22:24 I have coconut oil and shampoo/conditioner with coconut oil... 
617 2018-07-06 22:22:23 Or when you pay money to eat raw seeds and gargle oil for a week while walking barefoot in the grass

(my mum did that)
618 2018-07-06 22:22:22 My brother’s teaching me how to grow my hair out and I’m honestly thinking of flying to Morocco to get pure Argan oil. It brings out all my curls it’s the God of oils
619 2018-07-06 22:21:50 Yep.  Pruitt did a great job--for Big Oil!
620 2018-07-06 22:21:38 @FirestoneAuto store #29483 has had my 2017 Passat going on for 5.5hrs on two separate days for an oil change and alignment and it's still not correct. What's wrong with this picture?
621 2018-07-06 22:21:20 If you're wearing a gray shirt and you spill olive oil on it, it's going to stain. Oh, and no one will know what the hell kind of stain it is... 
#whatever
622 2018-07-06 22:21:18 I think if it's an oil based fuel  water can actually make the fire more volatile and spread. At least that's what I gathered from some quick research.
623 2018-07-06 22:21:15 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪

628 2018-07-06 22:20:32 It's totally goth to go out smelling like liniment, right?

"Hey baby, is that wok lok oil or have you just been recently embalmed?"
629 2018-07-06 22:20:15 The "bleating" (as you call it) isn't the end, but the beginning of policy change. I can't understand people like you:
We: "Stop subsidizing fossil fuel burning."
You: "Stop using oil if you don't like it."
We: "We'd love an alternative, let's invest to develop it."
You: "STFU!"
630 2018-07-06 22:20:12 Going to try my hand at making my own lavender oil.
631 2018-07-06 22:20:09 hint - Nintendo + 3rd parties mix as well as water and oil
632 2018-07-06 22:19:45 I don’t want to lecture, but if someone tells you to use coconut oil on your face don’t, please dont. Because coconut oil may clog your pores and that’s gonna a disaster
633 2018-07-06 22:19:40 My, my. It seems the more they protest, the more I get to learn about clean oil, the advantages of the pipeline over rail, the many hulled ships we use, the repressive societies of other oil producing nations, etc. The more I learn, the more I am onside with Alberta oil.
634 2018-07-06 22:19:37 My car has been on the road all week from Killeen to Dallas to BR now to Wisner. I need a oil change btw
635 2018-07-06 22:19:25 Prayers for your son,Henry. Yes,try the CBD OIL,I hear it works wonders! God Bless
636 2018-07-06 22:19:14 @tedcruz stop coal fire in Pennsylvania by doing like oil locations,frack it,pump it with water
637 2018-07-06 22:19:05 Moriel: + oil, where she had been in contact with the floor. If she had ever wanted something that would jar her from her grim thoughts, this might as well be it.

639 2018-07-06 22:18:49 How about you stop drilling for oil and ruining ecosystems/the environment in the process?
640 2018-07-06 22:18:30 i tweet selfies too much . i deserve to be drowned in virgin olive oil
641 2018-07-06 22:18:12 The greedy EDF crooks  are at it again, the price of oil is going DOWN but they are charging more for energy to their victims that can not switch suppliers.
642 2018-07-06 22:17:53 Does this go back to Trump saying Oil companies and pipeline companies should be using American steel?
643 2018-07-06 22:17:42 As an executive in the male-dominated oil and gas industry, Fern rarely shared details about her personal life, family, or love for Christ. Read how she learned to integrate the most important aspects of her life with LeaderImpact in this article from our latest #P2CMagazine.
644 2018-07-06 22:17:28 Erik, this might be a dumb question but I thought Syncrude takes the bitumen it produces and upgrades it to a lighter oil which is why the WCS spread should tighten as there is more room for WCS oil to be shipped and why WTI would lift due to less light oil being available.
645 2018-07-06 22:17:09 The elephant in the room is oil companies are depreciating assets. You will not find institutional takers as the oil age is coming to an end.
646 2018-07-06 22:16:49 @realDonaldTrump try to stop the coal fire in Pennsylvania by doing like fracking a oil well,pump it with water
647 2018-07-06 22:16:44 Her dad was an OIL TYCOON
648 2018-07-06 22:16:28 Now you can go do some wrestling. Can't let a good oil spread go to waste.

651 2018-07-06 22:15:28 Problem is ARAMCO does not release its reserve figures frequently  like other oil companies do, and there are question marks on the what is considered proven reserve by ARAMCO. This makes using  valuations.
652 2018-07-06 22:15:24 Woah - coconut oil and shea butter I swear by them for my hair, my hair has grown so much since I started using them 2 years ago.
653 2018-07-06 22:15:17 Oil, referree ...
654 2018-07-06 22:15:06 ive made it my life’s mission to scrëme at people who put coconut oil on their god damn faces
655 2018-07-06 22:14:59 everyone else fills up on BLTs traditional white toast, toast discounted whole wheat buns. while everyone has traditional mac/cheese, boil whole wheat pasta with brown rice with sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, broccoli. yum. dessert yogurt/fresh blackberries.
656 2018-07-06 22:14:33 “Maybe you should stop using toner, I never used it”
“I only wash my face with soap and water”
“You should moisturise with coconut oil”
Wow congratulations on your naturally clear skin. Please stop acting like acne can be cured by soap and water tho thanks.
657 2018-07-06 22:14:20 Finally getting an oil change after being 2 months overdue.. 
658 2018-07-06 22:14:13 Facts!! Joffrey would light Tariq ass on fire and pour hot oil on him and him family all while eating his dinner 
659 2018-07-06 22:13:52 Ah right so you dont want Scotland products ? No Scottish meat , fish , soft drinks , spring water, whisky , gin ok fine will take else where. No money tax no more revenue no more Scottish oil is that want you seriously want ? I want England as neighbors not rulers
660 2018-07-06 22:13:48 As when oil dropped last decade and hurt cellulosic biofuel startups, this is going to hurt startups working on alternative proteins - less investment with new price disparity.
661 2018-07-06 22:13:45 bread ephor tatters an olive oil
662 2018-07-06 22:13:38 also you can make some good teriyaki chicken don by making some rice and sweet teriyaki sauce by condensing: brown sugar, teriyaki sauce, and water. alternately you can also add some onion powder or sesame seed oil to taste before adding a little corn starch (careful with it)
663 2018-07-06 22:13:36 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
664 2018-07-06 22:13:31 Grew up in @PointPleasantCC NJ home of The Original @jerseymikes I will go with The Ol' Standard #2 Ham Capicola and cheese with oil and vinegar and sometimes "Scoop the Bread"
665 2018-07-06 22:13:20 the place where I get my oil change always quickly vacuums my car too. the guy opened my backseat, saw all of the random shit I have everywhere and just quickly closed it.. lmao
666 2018-07-06 22:13:18 Rubbish.  We knew people voted because they wanted better and had dreams for what the country could be and we knew that the Brexit campaign was selling snake oil.  We need to accept that the EU is here to stay and our rightful place is at the top table.
667 2018-07-06 22:13:12 Humboldt Creamery Vanilla Ice Cream Half Gallon, Kirkland Fresh Goat Cheese, Kirkland Organic Coconut Water, Kirkland Organic Coconut Oil
668 2018-07-06 22:13:07 And with the Tariff War there will be Job loss like we have never seen when Toyota and all the other foreign car makers leave the Job losses will ricochet from parts makers too. The only jobs left coal mining maybe some gas station if anyone is buying gas these days. Sad Oil MEN
669 2018-07-06 22:13:07 Damn right, that top ring is upside down, you’ll get terrible oil consumption and a 3% loss of compression. Other than that, though, looks ok...
670 2018-07-06 22:13:05 Curious as to why the Oil aren’t looking for bounce backs from guys like Ennis and Duclair? At $650k he can only improve. If they bust we didn’t overpay long term if not we add skill and speed.
671 2018-07-06 22:13:03 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
672 2018-07-06 22:12:51 I’m at Jiffy Lube waiting on my oil change and there’s a woman in the waiting room who, while in the process of changing her infant’s diaper, has removed most of her clothing and is now bent over in front of everybody with her naked buttocks fully exposed. #usecondoms

675 2018-07-06 22:12:18 this from the man that wanted to go after terrorist's families, who said 'take the oil'...so 'take the babies' is not a surprise- what surprises me is we aren't in their faces 24/7/365 till they are GONE!
676 2018-07-06 22:12:09 I’m about to start applying castor oil to my hair every day & see how long my hair is in like 3 months.

679 2018-07-06 22:11:44 There was a bearish rig count. This is why oil is up.
680 2018-07-06 22:11:42 Not ISIS. BAM is still in Sirte, and ISIS wouldn't be able to mobilize on a large scale in a city without AFRICOM knowing. The article suggests that it's BDB gathering for another push at the Oil Crescent. I'm skeptical; LNA has been spoiling for a fight in the west
681 2018-07-06 22:11:19 @dunkindonuts they weren’t good, mostly tasted like fried oil with very little sugar and no cinnamon - disappointed 
682 2018-07-06 22:11:03 Picked baby oil over the universal title I see?
683 2018-07-06 22:11:03 Venezuela has a dictatorship, I support the US removing maduro's regime to free my country and allow to have fair elections. 

I know they would "help" just for the oil , either way so be it. It's been 20 years. Not intervention allows the suffering to go on, look at Cuba.
684 2018-07-06 22:10:51 whoever is suffering from acne, get tea tree oil. Don’t waste time.

689 2018-07-06 22:10:05 let me guess. Baby oil
690 2018-07-06 22:09:58 Hey fantastic. Two nails in both left side tires found during my oil change/tire rotation appointment. Thankfully, the service tech apparently made a deal and I got out with just a $40 bill. Thank you super nice dude! (Oil changes are covered for the first three years for me.)
691 2018-07-06 22:09:54 How do you feel about Northern Oil and Gas?
692 2018-07-06 22:09:32 Happy birthday Mark Kwakye I appreciate you brother. More grace!
693 2018-07-06 22:09:26 When your dad offers to pay your oil change and you go and get it done but it cost 93 dollars like why did I get a car that requires synthetic oil 
694 2018-07-06 22:09:21 Other hint: As much as we love @ThadMoffitt and all the fine people at @pettysgarage who use our oil, I'm looking for Monster Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck drivers for this question.
695 2018-07-06 22:09:16 I remember a good few yrs ago someone was selling a small oil painting of jock stein by peter Howson for £1200 and I would hav3 had to borrow money for so I didn’t which I obviously regret!

*paints toenails*
*shaves entire body* 
*applies shiny oil to skin*
*finds most revealing bikini*
*takes a thousand selfies*

Getting ready for the beach at 30:
*shaves toes*
*cries*
704 2018-07-06 22:07:52 Also bentonite clay masks absorb the hell out of oil. Wet n Wild matte primer does a great job of hiding oil even on my forehead which is SO shiny
705 2018-07-06 22:07:46 I'm saying this as someone who had to take care of another person who had extensive burns on their hands from an oil fire.

No creams, no salves, nothing. It needs to be cooled off and kept clean, full stop.
706 2018-07-06 22:07:42 adding some white onions will add a good kick if you wanted one. Also if you ever do want to add some meat, marinating chicken with: sake, teriyaki sauce, a little bit of sesame oil, garlic powder, onion powder, and brown sugar makes for some good tender chicken
707 2018-07-06 22:07:40 Little oil
708 2018-07-06 22:07:33 Coffee, my car, good Indian food, sex, coconut oil, music, phone, a job I like.
709 2018-07-06 22:07:17 I have patches that continually fall out. But I am able to hide it. I use (and swear by olive oil with lavender and coconut oil).
I also rarely use shampoo my hair; I just cowash it. When I get too much build up, I use apple cidar vinegar.
Overall, the rest of my hair is better.
710 2018-07-06 22:07:16 Stuchel said it still had oil dick idk what the problem was
711 2018-07-06 22:07:07 Good spaghetti in Greece with olive oil & some mizithra cheese, nai? That is unless they didn't leave any olive oil for you.

715 2018-07-06 22:06:38 “Frankie” was written by Denise Rich, then wife of billionaire commodities trader Marc Rich (!). In 1983, the couple fled to Switzerland to avoid Mark Rich being prosecuted on charges including tax evasion and violating sanctions by trading oil with Iran. #TOTP

718 2018-07-06 22:06:30 Talking to a cute guy with long, gorgeous hair, and I'm hoping we get close enough that I get to oil it and comb/brush it. I love playing in long hair.
719 2018-07-06 22:06:28 The Cthulhu/Oil Industry convergence was probably inevitable
720 2018-07-06 22:06:01 It has oil. And bananas. Hidden in different places obviously.
721 2018-07-06 22:05:43 Why u like this na, u are too soft. Such death too fast,rub oil used in frying chicken or fish,tie him well to a chair n place him where those big rats are.
722 2018-07-06 22:05:36 ハス is the name of plant/flower. What you got is called 蓮根（れんこん）. It is nice to make it into crunchy きんぴら. I don't really know the definition of きんぴら but stir fry it till cooked, add soy sauce, mirin and a bit of chilli and pour some sesame oil at the very end.
723 2018-07-06 22:05:35 #RT @Oded121351: #Libya- pro-#LNA sources reporting on "spy plane" that was shot down over the Oil Crescent, with conflicting reports attributing the aircraft to either #Misrata or #Italy.
724 2018-07-06 22:05:25 I prefer oil.

730 2018-07-06 22:04:41 Lean ground Turkey with no oil
731 2018-07-06 22:04:41 Seems like some shit that would just piss you off because it's so much like the real thing but doesn't have THC. At least vaping CBD oil is a completely different experience.
732 2018-07-06 22:04:36 maybe there's some abandoned offshore oil platform he can just stay on
733 2018-07-06 22:04:16 Can't wait for my auntie to get off probation so I can put her on these oil pens
734 2018-07-06 22:04:10 Dropped my lunch on the ground, been at this oil change place for over an hour and a half, but John Tavares is a Toronto Maple Leaf so idgaf
735 2018-07-06 22:03:58 Im so so happy! I got my nails done today, got my ring replaced, my baby got an oil change, had some chipotle &my lashes are back in stock!!! #tgif 
736 2018-07-06 22:03:55 In Yachats taking an oil and cold wax painting workshop w Serena Barton. Day one is only making backgrounds for future painting. Tomorrow I’ll add more layers of paint, collage, and or drawing and see what wants to emerge. Lots of fun and inquiry.
737 2018-07-06 22:03:48 And worse, as more alternatives come into use, demand for oil drops, reducing it's price. This means we'll use literally *all* of it if I civilization lasts long enough.
738 2018-07-06 22:03:46 When my hair is dry virg. olive oil and water does miraclesssss
739 2018-07-06 22:03:38 Just took my blood pressure and it was 115/51  lol told ya cbd oil worked to mellow me out

742 2018-07-06 22:03:26 They are starting to work things out. Last I heard the SDF and the government did agree on one oil field and that the government will get 65% of the oil from those pumps and SDF will take 35%. Hopefully they'll make more agreements on them all in SDF areas.
743 2018-07-06 22:03:01 おはようございます
744 2018-07-06 22:02:54 Thieves oil.
745 2018-07-06 22:02:35 waiting three hours for the next oil change cuz you’re ahead, sucks absolute ass
746 2018-07-06 22:02:33 Shah got oil and diamond money. So that’s light to him. Me on the other hand, I went to jersey the other day.
747 2018-07-06 22:02:33 Cheer on @IndyEleven tonight as they play against Charlotte Independence tomorrow at 7 p.m. at Lucas Oil Stadium!
748 2018-07-06 22:02:16 Outrageous. Some ppl’s OT > Base Pay, top end salaries & to top it off - Bonuses. Close to 20 years in oil field & in that time I haven’t totalled the bonus amounts paid by a crown corp. to some of the people for a year. Just disgusted.
749 2018-07-06 22:02:13 @kenjilopezalt Looking at your fried chick recipe in Food Lab and wondering about the oil selection vs. target oil temp (stated to be 425°F). Skipping peanut oil due to allergy, but thinking the recommended alt (veg shortening) will smoke at that temp? Am I missing something?
750 2018-07-06 22:01:44 You really can’t see that Bush & Everyone since Reagan shipped jobs away while raising taxes?
Stopped Nuclear from increasing? Stopped Oil exploration? Increased size of Government?

Your either Blind or completely misinformed.
EPA was taking over all Water rights to harm USA
751 2018-07-06 22:01:36 When you drive so much you have to spend money on tires twice as often as the average driver. Breaks & oil change coming up too.  #coachingproblems
752 2018-07-06 22:01:35 Hey don’t sit in the sun for 5.5 hours wearing only spf 8 sun oil. You’ll get pretty burnt 
753 2018-07-06 22:01:22 Andrew Wheeler is a climate change denier and a coal lobbyist. He lobbied for chemical and big oil companies. He is worse than Pruitt and doesn’t have the baggage. He might as well wear a sign they says “fuck the environment”.
754 2018-07-06 22:01:22 I never met Chavez, but I get the vibe that he was a dickhead who wanted the right things but couldn't pull it off for want of well-developed infrastructure. Venezuela's great sin is that its infrastructure is entirely built around a  single-source extractive industry (oil).
755 2018-07-06 22:01:19 How will the UK survive with out the EU *looks to Norway* idk trade and Oil?
756 2018-07-06 22:01:18 All about the oil
757 2018-07-06 22:01:06 The US is in these countries mostly with the approval of the government. Ergo, no invasion.

Furthermore, the US does not need the oil. We have plenty already and have had so for decades. War for oil is a tired and inaccurate argument.
758 2018-07-06 22:01:05 Co's accepting #AKoil credit subsidies agreed when they did that AK could reduce payments if $$oil dropped. But when that happened in 2015, the co's whined about the cuts. This past session the #AKgov & these #AKleg relented, in a way that INCREASES COSTS to future #AKs. WTH
759 2018-07-06 22:01:05 @PeterAttiaMD can you share with me your thoughts on MCT oil ?

763 2018-07-06 22:00:42 I think that this will happen, but not in the way we would want it to. As oil runs out, alternative sources will look better and better, but the actual price paid for energy will be ever-increasing. Oil has to become the more expensive option before we stop using it.
764 2018-07-06 22:00:36 Georgia LIED through her teeth. Ellie needs a box she's no oil painting herself. Laura is going through it every minute someone's tryna steal her man #loveisland
765 2018-07-06 22:00:34 I have a update to my first Tweet regarding the New Albany Firestone. The Manager Kevin Conkle covered the installation charges and gave me two free oil changes. Next time I'll hold off before I prematurely judge a business. They are the best!
766 2018-07-06 22:00:27 left work to drop off my car to get an oil change, met up with some friends for a quick farewell din picking up my car now then headed to the beach. whew talk about having to be at many places at ONCE. 
767 2018-07-06 22:00:26 Oil market has very little rationale. Bearish API so it drops and bearish  BH Rig count today and it spikes . #OOTT So I must ask:

781 2018-07-06 21:58:47 Things were going smooth, but on my way to another camp the heat killed my truck. It overheated and burned out all my oil....hopefully it’s a quick fix...DAMN ITS HOT!! 
782 2018-07-06 21:58:40 A successful Canadian petroleum industry competes against conflict oil, both domestically and in new export markets. Maybe you are benefiting somehow when a Saudi sheikh buys another gold-plated commode, but on this point I’m taking a stand.
783 2018-07-06 21:58:39 Keep in mind that although Icahn is no longer in any official position he - and Perry and Zinke and other Big Oil boys - is still certainly whispering in POTUS's ear.

785 2018-07-06 21:58:31 I get my car back today. They apparently replaced the wipers for free because the driver side one that has been fucked up for months was triggering them lmao ....I promise I was gonna get it replaced the next time I got my oil changed

790 2018-07-06 21:58:01 Maybe I should have mixed it with a carrier oil or something? It was a bottle of vitamin E oil I bought from Fred's on a teary pregnant whim. Nothing high dollar. I think there's a couple of different forms of it and some are better than others?

792 2018-07-06 21:57:54 “Probably the single biggest influencer of oil prices is OPEC, made up of 13 countries (Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela); collectively, OPEC controls 40% of the world's supply of oil.”

798 2018-07-06 21:56:57 Here I only can to thank @realDonaldTrump for the truth: the U.S. protects Germany from Russia but Germans pay billions and billions of dollars to Russia for gas and oil.  Who is a dupe? Germany should pay for all.

807 2018-07-06 21:55:59 Let me guess cover them in oil maybe some salt or butter and shove in an oven for 10 minutes?
808 2018-07-06 21:55:42 If it’s allergies try some stahist- it’s over the counter and works well. But you have to ask a pharmacist for it. Peppermint oil is good too!
809 2018-07-06 21:55:37 Opec watch and listen. America actually has a leader so play nice or we'll make our own oil and gas production. #TRUMP
810 2018-07-06 21:55:35 “$6 FOR A QUART OF OIL??? IM NEVER COMING HERE FOR THAT AGAIN” ......okay, go to Autozone then?????
811 2018-07-06 21:55:25 I didn't then, no. My routine was coconut oil before shower with the water already going to make it humid and slightly unbearable, wash it off, and after wards pat dry and slather straight out vitamin E oil on all stretch mark vulnerable areas. Then lotion.
812 2018-07-06 21:55:21 Hey all! Groom Keepers all organic beard oil to be available on Amazon in mid-late July! New formula is 100% certified USDA organic, made in USA!
813 2018-07-06 21:54:21 Great.
I read somewhere abt a study where they gave 1/2 the patients (mild depression) anti-depressants, the other 1/2, oily fish (the oil in which has a beneficial effect on the brain), & the fish eaters made better progress. Oily fish is easy to get in tinned salmon or mackerel
814 2018-07-06 21:54:20 If Iran is forced in to such a position, the world will come to understand the power Iran resonates across the globe; reaching every sector relying on Oil / Gas & much more!
815 2018-07-06 21:54:09 Oil Rigs WERE Aberdeen, it was unthinkable....
816 2018-07-06 21:54:08 Stir in two scoops of olive oil then raise the temperature.
817 2018-07-06 21:53:56 Not only do we have to drill more we need more refineries to process the crude oil. That's how you drive OPEC prices down.
818 2018-07-06 21:53:31 I like Maroon, but I think it’s pretty safe to say if the Oilers are shedding space it’s either Sekera or Lucic. Can’t see them shedding a ton of space. Cap will have to come back to the Oil to make a deal happen.
819 2018-07-06 21:53:30 Now you know like I do niggas will ride their car till it dies with the check engine light on and it be some as simple as needing an oil change but they didn't wanna spend bread on that oil change at the moment
820 2018-07-06 21:53:27 I know this is not the answer you're looking for but I'd kill for that hair so I'd say embrace it  (also I guess coconut oil?)
821 2018-07-06 21:53:14 Sorry darling it's better u found food inside I used to find ice or fat(oil) that was left when Mon was making wors..

831 2018-07-06 21:52:04 Some oil drilling company must go drill down and rescue those kids.  It’s an EMERGENCY!
832 2018-07-06 21:51:52 Haha. Yes Neroli oil is lush. Must get myself some more 
833 2018-07-06 21:51:52 That’s a slippery slope... 

I did not back down, poured a bit of caster sugar on there and ate them as if I was Jamie Oliver eating some “lovely” modern food all covered with olive oil... 

There is con in conundrum, never forget that...?
834 2018-07-06 21:51:51 You might also try massaging with castor oil once I week! I heard it does wonders c:
835 2018-07-06 21:51:51 WTF!!!! Okay, explain this: We have the largest oil reserves in the world AND WE STILL HAVE THE HIGHEST INFLATION IN THE WORLD! Making food and medicine INACCESSIBLE. If you came, you'll see people eating in the GARBAGE.
836 2018-07-06 21:51:46 I would suggest Rick Simpson oil in addition to the CBD.
837 2018-07-06 21:51:36 Cheap excuse for running away from hot oil splashing on you

842 2018-07-06 21:51:03 You could substitute oil for cobalt/coltan/lanthanum etc and the equation still holds for the EV revolution; a marginalised community is left behind while the resources they didn't have the means to exploit make a few insanely rich. Sustainable practices do matter
843 2018-07-06 21:50:48 US doesn’t want to end this war either. They only care about oil.
844 2018-07-06 21:50:40 This is why I take and prefer transit to and from work. I am sick of Big oil and that jackass 45 #cdnpoli oh yeah I do own a car that I enjoy driving on the weekends
845 2018-07-06 21:50:35 But seriously he gives me “I stare at myself in the mirror while I oil myself” vibes
846 2018-07-06 21:50:22 Been an eventful day. Got an oil change, drove around to make sure everything else was okay but instead my car died bc the belt broke, making me coolant leak, battery died, had it towed, got a Lyft back home. Im not even mad tbh LOL
847 2018-07-06 21:50:14 That is indeed a pretty shitty state of affairs! May i suggest if not already you check they havent filed in USA too? Happened to a client of mine but it was oil tools
848 2018-07-06 21:50:00 Maybe a good time to shut off the oil refineries and the smelter which pump out enough smoke daily to rival a wildfire.
849 2018-07-06 21:49:48 Problem is none of this globalized wisdom got us anywhere but taken advantage of. Give Trump the support he needs - Maxine Waters and her ilk on CNN are bad enough

853 2018-07-06 21:49:37 The movie, "Backstabbing For Beginners" great movie. A must see for all. Corruption in high places. Iraqi oil for food program a "cash cow" of corruption. Godless, greedy diplomacy. It's all about the kick backs. #DrainTheSwamp

858 2018-07-06 21:49:05 i wish i enjoyed the taste of cbd oil ya girl over here chasin that ish
859 2018-07-06 21:48:57 People would only be okay with that if it were as cheap or cheaper than fossil fuels. If it wasn't (and it looks like it's never going to be), they'd vote for politicians who will make oil the go-to again.
860 2018-07-06 21:48:52 Why can’t we develop our economy with new energy sources?! Because oil money has corrupted so many governments   That is where Putin gets much of his dirty money   Why destroy our planet so these grifters can get even richer ?
861 2018-07-06 21:48:48 What you put in it? Butter or MCT OIL?
862 2018-07-06 21:48:47 ICE doesn't liberate communities. U just make up shit to sell your snake oil. U shouldn't be allowed to run a realty office, far less a country. Amnesty for all separated family members. #ReuniteFamiliesNow by flying all 3,000 children & their families to 1 place immediately!
863 2018-07-06 21:48:35 @chrissyteigen x Becca Body Oil is heaven sent 
864 2018-07-06 21:48:33 Idk, I just don’t think that lemon essential oil can fix the fact that you’re a dumb hoe
865 2018-07-06 21:48:15 Just changed my oil in my car myself for the first time. Ya boi feelin like I should be on west coast customs. Fuck wit me.
866 2018-07-06 21:48:15 During shower
—Wet your skin & exfoliate with a sugar scrub (white sugar+coconut oil)
—Rinse off the scrub then shave (using a shaving cream w aloe vera in it)
—Use your fav body wash
—Finish off wish a in shower body lotion (Nivea has a cocoa butter one that smells so good)
867 2018-07-06 21:47:39 @NYBakeryCo I bought your cinnamon bagels for the first time purely because they were the only sweet fruity bread product I could find with no palm oil in them, added bonus is the whole family love them so please don't change your recipe they are our new breakfast favourites!!!
868 2018-07-06 21:47:37 I use bringadhi ayurvedic oil castor oil coconut oil and it's calm
869 2018-07-06 21:47:19 Next bodybuild show later this year. Finishing touches going on the “oil girl” application. Job description includes: rubbing my entire body down w oil. Abdominal glance allowed every 2 mins. Will pay in trident gum. *request trident payment on app* #thatisall
870 2018-07-06 21:47:09 While others groan, you will grow & like Asher dip ur feet in oil for grace & prosperity. Ur feet shall be as iron to crush Satan's head
871 2018-07-06 21:46:54 Ah! I once boarded a plane, that had just landed, only to be escorted off again 15 minutes later: “we have a hydraulic problem....... in fact, the oil is spraying out”
872 2018-07-06 21:46:49 Do you really think the reason the US didn't get any 'Med oil deals' (How about Noble?) had anything to do with Popo? What oil deals has he ever cut?

A big reason is, by law, US companies can't pay bribes.Makes it tough to get deals in 3rd world where bribery is standard.
873 2018-07-06 21:46:47 Niggas worried about the mileage on a bitch pussy, but don't get their car's oil changed according to the schedule mileage intervals, now you can't figure out why your car making weird noises. I'm so sick of you niggas.
874 2018-07-06 21:46:45 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
875 2018-07-06 21:46:35 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
876 2018-07-06 21:46:32 Oligarch training? Each one gets his own oil/gas company.
877 2018-07-06 21:46:27 Very interesting , wasn’t sure Oil would even offer him anything
878 2018-07-06 21:46:06 Welp doctor prescribed me CBD oil 
879 2018-07-06 21:46:03 There is not just one contributor to climate change. The rich and oil companies make it hard for political reform on energy due to lobbying and political power. The middle class sucks for helping vote these people in to office and by buying fossil fuel. Also farm animals fart.
880 2018-07-06 21:46:00 Saudi family is exporting lots of oil and purchasing weapons against Yemenis innocent children , then they presume that their people are idiots, making idiotic justification for their the poor Hijaz people!!!
881 2018-07-06 21:45:59 Stop coming to get your oil changed. You’re killing my employees and myself with heat exhaustion.
882 2018-07-06 21:45:56 Yep...that is why Pruitt stayed on for so long. The rich Trump donors like Big Oil wanted all the deregs that Pruitt did one after the other very quickly.
883 2018-07-06 21:45:56 And don't forget they have the largest oil reserves in the world and I love your comments also thank you

890 2018-07-06 21:45:03 Have any of my friends on here tried cbd oil for cystic acne/anxiety?
891 2018-07-06 21:44:59 It is the middle class, but would we still be using oil if more effort had been made to make more electric/alternative energy vehicles and further make those easily available to the public at large?
892 2018-07-06 21:44:47 Do I have any male friends on here that would change my oil for me if I buy the shit ya girl needs help
893 2018-07-06 21:44:45 23/ We share our medical marijuana with them and catch up on the Fake News.

No sign of the Tower of Fox's evil wizard, Sean Hannity, or his familiar, Bill Wormtongue O'Reilly.  Buried under the lawsuits, no doubt.

Man, I really need a hot oil massage!

896 2018-07-06 21:44:11 1.The whole of my childhood was in communist Bulgaria. You had to wait for many years on a waiting list to buy a shitty car. I've been on a day long queue for vegetable oil. If you were  lucky and someone visited the capital in December you might get to eat a banana or an orange.
897 2018-07-06 21:44:09 I don't remember the last time my coconut oil was solid..
898 2018-07-06 21:44:08 When an artist does an actual oil painting as a fanart: nut
899 2018-07-06 21:44:06 Yes bro, I stop buying it... just buying olive & safflower oil. God bless you! 
#brotherhoodInChrist
900 2018-07-06 21:44:02 You want a good one?
This morning at the hotel, I took 2 pancakes and there was a nice metallic jar next to them so I assumed it was maple syrup and started pouring 
Turns out it was olive oil
Well it really wasn’t very good
901 2018-07-06 21:43:56 all the so called celebrities looking like floor cleaners.... LOL
902 2018-07-06 21:43:47 Golden generations are just oil to lubricate the hard work of building a better player production pipeline. And the better your pipeline, the greater the likelihood of another golden generation down the line. Virtuous cycle if done right.
903 2018-07-06 21:43:40 Deep faith? You’re a democrat, that’s like oil and water, won’t mix! MAGA
904 2018-07-06 21:43:33 Exactly... And then their dependence on oil crushed their ability to fund social programs. Socialism doesn't inherently mean socializing the enegery industry.
905 2018-07-06 21:43:31 Only wash it like 2x a week it sounds gross but eventually the oil production slows and it’s made my hair grow way faster and healthier
906 2018-07-06 21:43:05 All those U.S. based wells we recently opened during Obama years are idle because they want to manipulate supply side of chain. Guess they got spoiled on $100 a barrel oil.
907 2018-07-06 21:43:03 The mini-hood will go to:

The first person who can name every NASCAR series driver who uses Performance Plus Oil. 

Reeeeeeaddy.........GO!
908 2018-07-06 21:42:57 if you can't control you borders in Que. keep the problem to yourself . Ont new sheriff. Boycott Que. dairy the cause of NAFTA failure.

911 2018-07-06 21:41:56 I assumed this tweet would have solved the oil markets. Why didn't gas prices change?

913 2018-07-06 21:41:34 Wow Gaga as a mermaid was so legendary and also a political statement being covered in oil when that whole BP mess covered the ocean like wow queen of the sea and politics
914 2018-07-06 21:41:17 And didn't you vote YES on this thief's nomination? The gutting of our natural resources to the highest oil/coal bidder is ON YOU Rubio! I hope that your ass is voted out for good.
915 2018-07-06 21:41:12 طبعا الoil نوع منlipids وبتتكون من جزيء غليسرايد وثلاثه من سلسلة هايدرو كاربون غير ذائبه من الماء والها نوعين مشبعه وغير مشبعه وفي عدة انواع من الlipids منها :phospholipids sphingolipids
916 2018-07-06 21:41:12 I would if it was an urgent item but it’s just an oil diffuser and a broom . They’re usually really great I’ll live
917 2018-07-06 21:41:00 Before you splash hot oil on me
918 2018-07-06 21:40:56 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
919 2018-07-06 21:40:55 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
920 2018-07-06 21:40:43 Assad had to know this was pending since he banned the U.S. dollar. Iran and Venezuela also considering the same. Syria has struck an oil export deal with Pakistan.

926 2018-07-06 21:40:08 James 5:13,14
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

933 2018-07-06 21:39:33 I found out how much it will cost to replace windows in my house and it's less than I thought so I'm doing it one window at a time. This was big for us. No cracks in Windows makes for a much warmer winter, with oil continuing to go up this was a necessity.
934 2018-07-06 21:39:23 SHAME ON TV THE DOCTORS SHOW channel 2 promotingPoisonCanola oil.CanolaOil isDangerousAvoid it.Its cheapOil,burnsTooHigh,&UsedForCar engines
935 2018-07-06 21:39:18 ND owns a successful state bank and grain elevators, and is working on an oil refinery.  Corporate farming is not allowed per the constitution.
The hard working people of ND go for the practical.  Maybe you should stop trying to repeat outdated cliches.
936 2018-07-06 21:39:10 Nah, I just look at Drumheller, Alberta, Canada, where they find dinosaur bones close to the surface, but, hot diggity dog, no oil or gas.  Didn’t know there were that many dinosaurs all over the earth, that oil keeps coming back, into wells that quit producing 20 or 30years ago
937 2018-07-06 21:39:04 So now your premise is that the Blue Zones are on a refined carb, seed oil, junk food diet? Prove it.
938 2018-07-06 21:38:53 The #ScottPruitt resignation baffles me. Why? For being corrupt?! Show me a climate-denier who ISN'T taking money to promote/allow earth-destroying policies #EPA @EPA? Anyone Trump appoints will already be making millions off big oil, just like the R's that approve the pick.
939 2018-07-06 21:38:46 Went to local John Deere dealership to pick up some parts. 

Took the kids for a drive past the tractors before we left. 

5 year old sees a John Deere 4020 (with a puddle of oil underneath) in the lineup. 

“That looks like one in our price range” he says. 

Damn.  He’s right.

942 2018-07-06 21:38:20 The Happy Meal is just the 1960s standard McD's hamburger and the original size fries a small coke with a box & toy thrown in. Believe it or not, in 1963 that hamburger actually was real meat! And grilled in front of you. And the fries were cooked to browned in the good oil
943 2018-07-06 21:38:17 this is IFS level jobthey should be doing this. you should work on something higher like getting malya and nirav modi back, like getting italian marines back....

946 2018-07-06 21:38:09 Not loyal to any technology that hasn’t developed into a fiscally reliant alternative!Why not use our Canadian oil resources to help develop that new technology?What the heck is wrong with that?
947 2018-07-06 21:38:02 I watched that Colonel Sanders episode of General Hospital today on TV while getting my oil changed and boy was that weird!
948 2018-07-06 21:37:46 Anyway, I find it amusing coz in 30 years the oil may not be as valuable as fuel and then back to the status quo! The huge strides being made by the Chinese and Tesla in EVs and batteries may make the combustion engine = horse and buggy
949 2018-07-06 21:37:17 @RowdyScarlett  World stunned, Planes from Orbit strike every Oil well on Planet except ones in GOON CONTROL.
950 2018-07-06 21:37:05 “Follow the money”. And the oil stains.
951 2018-07-06 21:36:55 USA and Canada are now net exporters of oil. Only California still imports Middle East oil because they won't build a pipeline to Texas

957 2018-07-06 21:36:24 Chicken breast = dry. So in this case I would make a quick marinade. 1/2 cup olive oil mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of grub rub in a Ziploc. Stab breasts with fork lots. Put meat in ziploc. Swish & let sit for a while in the fridge. Then BBQ and dust with more rub at the end #moist
958 2018-07-06 21:36:12 Class 8 orders recently peaked at 48k in January at levels a little higher than the 45k in Summer ‘14 before oil blew up from $110 down to sub $30. Now specs all time highs at another peak. Last 2 business cycle peaks we had the exact same problems. $PCAR stock tells the rt. tail
959 2018-07-06 21:36:10 Too bad, so sad. It’s their own fucking fault. They believed a con man selling snake oil at the fair over the facts that were right in front of their faces. You made your bed, you lay in it.
960 2018-07-06 21:35:58 Really affordable and my makeup sits way nicer on top than so many more expensive things I've tried. Also bog standard rosehip oil at night. Beautiful stuff.

966 2018-07-06 21:34:44 Proof that he’s not doing what exactly? What do u imagine is happening? I’m sorry, but until u have some kind of proof about this oil oligarchy conspiracy of yours, I will continue to believe that u r just making stuff up.

971 2018-07-06 21:33:50 20 years since Venezuela went socialist, the economy of the most beautiful,  most oil rich country collapsed. How many Venezuelans do you know? I have a 100 working for me.They left, they were starving.  When the socialists take over and can't run anything it all turns to crap.
972 2018-07-06 21:33:49 I have made lots of new FB friends in the past 6 months so anyone here who is interested in trying CBD oil pls feel free to message . Some day soon CBD  will be a household name .
973 2018-07-06 21:33:37 The whole argument is ridiculous.  We have hundreds of inventions on file to completely eliminate the need for oil.  We live in an electric universe.  I don't feel it's right to withhold that tech, then try to charge carbon credits to use the old tech because it's harmful
974 2018-07-06 21:33:33 i took my car in to get an oil change and ended up spending $900 on new tires and brakes
975 2018-07-06 21:33:17 It's his specialty: gosh gallop. He doesn't know what any of those mean, as if any of those apply to snake oil homeopathy (no, they don't).
976 2018-07-06 21:33:15 At Jiffy Lube
So, yesterday knight we drop off our bus for oil service. Next day we in the morning we called them to let them know what we need to get done. They told us that they requested to tow our vehicle away. And that's after using them for over 6 years.

978 2018-07-06 21:33:05 Oil is obsolete. Anything you say is biased.
979 2018-07-06 21:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.

984 2018-07-06 21:32:30 Oh the Clyde?  Usually all the SNP care about.   Never mind North Sea Fishing.  How the hell does that matter? Or Oil.  Just reminding you of Aberdeen on this anniversary of the #PiperAlpha disaster, like the SNP could give a monkeys about The Granite City or the North East?
985 2018-07-06 21:32:25 I was  excited to try this.I tried your fried chicken last week and was so disappointed. It was borderline inedible. I could not even bite the edges it was so hard & the batter was completely tasteless save for the taste of oil. We had a roll that couldn't be cut with a knife!
986 2018-07-06 21:32:17 #FunFactFriday: one ton of #recycled #cardboard saves:
390 kWh hours of electricity
46 gallons of oil
6.6 million Btu’s of energy
9 cubic yards of landfill space
987 2018-07-06 21:31:19 I'm for coal and oil production. Half my family is in the oilfield
988 2018-07-06 21:31:12 I am also not a hypocrite who thinks he's entitled, while out of the other side of my mouth telling others how they aren't entitled to the same things because they didn't choose to fight corporate wars for Halliburton & the oil companies. 1/
989 2018-07-06 21:31:01 I was sleeping on extra virgin olive oil as a salad dressing. It’s all about those healthy fats 
990 2018-07-06 21:30:49 U shouldn't waste so much time, get to work, or wash dishes in Ur kitchen or help Ur wife wash clothes, do something productive. I already have enough with my job (oil industry) and the things of my home! Go, baby, do something for Ur miserable life! 
991 2018-07-06 21:30:45 i burn the top of my fingers while cooking 2 fucking eggs & 5 small pieces of meat with lots of oil all dump in one, I'm a chaotic lazy.
992 2018-07-06 21:30:44 I'm not one for greenery in my drinks but that looks that good it takes away that the table could do with a little rub of linseed oil.
993 2018-07-06 21:30:29 Yeah, because everyone knows that burning oil and coal and breathing In smog is much healthier for everyone
994 2018-07-06 21:30:24 Getting my car oil change and wash.
A wash car is a happy car. 
995 2018-07-06 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
996 2018-07-06 21:30:05 @DrGundry Mr. Gundry-Now you're attacking toothpaste giving out your home made formula and guess what Coconut oil is your base. You're making the same mistakes Oz made. Soon doctors will be outing you as a (some already do) snake oil salesman that can smell $$$ everywhere.
997 2018-07-06 21:30:05 At least you weren't naked and covered in oil.
998 2018-07-06 21:29:49 Scolding hot coconut oil season is upon us. I'm sorry in advance for fucking up your couch through November. Godbless
999 2018-07-06 21:29:12 It’s hard to make a profit when you’re not receiving Govt subsidies... Mr AlBaker should try to run a business the old fashion way instead of w subsidies from oil sales in his country. @WeAreALPA @AFLCIO
1000 2018-07-06 21:29:07 If anyone tries to deny climate change hit them with the pollution facts. They can't deny toxic algea, oil slicks, and toxic run off. They can't deny smog, a rise in autism and cancer, nor birth defects in certain towns. Don't let them focus on climate change as the only thing.
1001 2018-07-06 21:28:47 Trump urges Saudis to raise oil output 'by two million barrels'

The US president says he asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production due to "turmoil in Iran".
1002 2018-07-06 21:28:40 Bitches be like “drink water” “put coconut oil on your face” naaah bitch what’s the full recipe 
1003 2018-07-06 21:28:39 Thank God for Inuka tissue oil 
1004 2018-07-06 21:28:17 Oil? Cream creamer etc suggests dairy to me.  Oil and sugar are not healthy.
1005 2018-07-06 21:28:15 I’m getting an oil change it’s FOR SURE over
1006 2018-07-06 21:28:11 Got some @CloudN9neSyrup CBD oil comin my way :) goodbye chronic pain
1007 2018-07-06 21:28:09 He's no oil painting that's for sure
1008 2018-07-06 21:28:06 We are here for that changing oil and opening stuck pickle jars
1009 2018-07-06 21:27:59 If Greenpeace had any viable alternatives, it might help, they don't, just bleating about sustainable energy, whilst turning a blind eye to countries that supply our oil & have appalling human rights records, especially women's human rights, it's just convenient to target Canada.
1010 2018-07-06 21:27:52 “When you put palm oil on a white plate and you clean it off” 
ffs Nedum
1011 2018-07-06 21:27:42 You’re the golden goose of shorting oil! I was too early so I just made back losses...I’ll add if you add! 
1012 2018-07-06 21:27:34 Pathetic green nutters. Earthquakes are common and there are usually follow-on quakes. Hope they get that oil out soon. Sick of paying your benefits.
1013 2018-07-06 21:27:22 Friendship and money is like

Don't mix.

1014 2018-07-06 21:27:09 @oil_shaeikh no
1015 2018-07-06 21:27:08 Think about where countries other than the US get their oil from, then this starts to make sense...  As does other things such as Chinese investments in Nigeria and Venezuela.  Fusion will be a paradigm shift in so many ways!
1016 2018-07-06 21:27:03 At the time Duke was the governor. Things were flouririshing. But during Imoke's regime, they lost oil wells to both Cameroon and Akwa Ibom. It was all downhill from there
1017 2018-07-06 21:27:00 Actually Animal Agriculture accounts for 91% of Amazon deforestation, palm oil is destructive, but not as destructive as Animal Ag. You don’t have to eat palm oil though, I eat a Whole Foods Plant Based diet, which includes no oil, so I don’t have to worry about that either. :)
1018 2018-07-06 21:26:58 That looks like a platform for selling incredibly overpriced maintenance and parts, tbh
"$500 for an oil change?!?!"
"We need special laser-forged beryllium alloy sockets to be able to remove the bomb-proof undercarriage plates..."
1019 2018-07-06 21:26:48 Before the time of wheel and gear
We took the beast's oil in yesteryear
Then oil came as the blood of land
Paid and secured by the blood of man
1020 2018-07-06 21:26:39 Hash oil موافق علي ايه هو اي حاجه وخلاص 
1021 2018-07-06 21:26:30 Try castor oil
1022 2018-07-06 21:26:18 That, or similar variations of the same theme: Independence Day when the rest of the world is waiting on the US for a solution, or Armageddon when the oil diggers have to learn to be astronauts because astronauts can't possibly learn how to dig. All about massaging delicate egos.
1023 2018-07-06 21:26:17 Zarif wants the guarantee. the EU wants a supplement to the Iran deal, is not going to go anywhere as Iran wants to sell oil and banking sanction lifted totally.
1024 2018-07-06 21:26:16 Just buy 40litres of oil and fry the officer like chicken..
1025 2018-07-06 21:26:08 Just saw a Tesla with an “LOL OIL” license plate. #HeavyFlex
1026 2018-07-06 21:25:58 I’m finna do a hot oil treatment on my hair :)
1027 2018-07-06 21:25:37 Actually, the Americans have 4MM b/d of heavy crude refining capacity and with Venezuela imploding, they need Canadian oil. I hear India is also suffering from the drop in Venezuelan exports.
1028 2018-07-06 21:25:29 Norway is unreformed. Sweden, Denmark and Finland had to do harsh reforms in the 90s to cure the malaise Nordic Third-Way Socialism had caused in the 70-80s. Norway didn't have to because of oil revenue, still have the same underlying dysfunction hidden bc of the oil revenue.
1029 2018-07-06 21:25:19 Can y’all fight in the war too and change the oil work on the car do any manual labor jobs. And if y’all hit us we can square up cause equality
1030 2018-07-06 21:25:14 So. Packed shopping like an idiot. Glass olive oil bottle thrown out of bike basket, hit concrete.

Bounced; didn't break.

And as evidence goes, based on one occasion, my "Olive oil bottle didn't break" is as equally (in)valid as "Cycle helmet saved my life."


1031 2018-07-06 21:25:09 @GulfOilIndia where I can buy gulf powertrac 4t engine oil in Hyderabad, please mention me your outlet and authorized shop
1032 2018-07-06 21:25:03 today was wash day haha. but I use moisturizing conditioner and a clarifying shampoo. then Bella Curls and Aunt Jackie’s products work best for me personally. anything from them tbh. and I use argon oil on wash days. I’m still trying to research products and such though.
1033 2018-07-06 21:24:54 I haven't made that yet, I want to next. How long does it take you and how long did it last? Coconut oil lasted me foreeever..

1039 2018-07-06 21:24:30 Oil base mud and heat. Worse combination ever. Don’t @me.

1046 2018-07-06 21:23:17 If you win the election, will you and @coalitionavenir give the oil and gas industry a chance to show what they can do for the economy and for the residents in Quebec?
1047 2018-07-06 21:23:11 why would I ever coconut oil my body down like this, knowing damn well I’m going back outside.
1048 2018-07-06 21:23:09 Oh no! If you have oregano oil (best if applied immediately) place it gently on the burn area. You can mix it with olive or coconut oil as well. Hope it heals soon!
1049 2018-07-06 21:22:56 Got so many hangnails that I'm having to rub coconut oil on them, I now smell like a Bounty bar.
1050 2018-07-06 21:22:50 This oil burn makes it look like I have a hickey smh

1052 2018-07-06 21:22:42 It's been so warm this week that my coconut oil has been in liquid form for the last 6 days straight. So basically I've discovered the most millennial harbinger of the apocalypse imaginable...
1053 2018-07-06 21:22:35 How many countries would we have to invade to take their solar power instead of oil? How many wars would we start over access to photons?
1054 2018-07-06 21:22:13 My oil pen likes to play this game with me in where it hides for 3-5 days and then it appears out of nowhere
1055 2018-07-06 21:22:11 starting oil short again LOL
1056 2018-07-06 21:22:08 So why have you been suspended from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil?

1058 2018-07-06 21:21:53 Use Gentle majic products to remove the dark spot and for oil control
1059 2018-07-06 21:21:47 I think about you every night before I take my prune juice and fish oil pills.
1060 2018-07-06 21:21:45 I can change the oil and give it a wipe with a cloth, will that do!

1063 2018-07-06 21:21:15 @RaptorPolitics Having  just return from the Somme, I wonder how I saw up to 5 Hen/Marsh Harriers a day in probably 10 square miles of wheat/grain/oil seed farm land besides the same in Buzzards. How many in my native county of Lincolnshire on the similar Wolds?

1066 2018-07-06 21:20:53 Thanks, but let's wait and see whether the rulers of Iran can raise one finger against the flow of oil from the Arab Gulf states.

1070 2018-07-06 21:20:11 How about hepatitis? Do you think you could manage hepatitis at home? Gosh...you might need to take your kid to the big bad hospital for that  
How about pneumonia, is there an essential oil for that one, or a superfood that would cure it? Damn, that might require medicine.
1071 2018-07-06 21:19:57 @habitburger Love your burgers, but it’s a real shame that you only offer American “cheese“. Vegetable oil paste with food coloring is a shabby way to top a good burger.
1072 2018-07-06 21:19:57 As Americans spend more to fill up their vehicles, ask how much money @realDonaldTrump is making? The Saudi's need oil prices to increase.
1073 2018-07-06 21:19:55 She needs inflatables and baby oil  or her ugly betty glasses, sexy secretary!

1123 2018-07-06 21:14:17 I doubt they would add oil unless your tires needed it. Lol. I think most tires today are maintainence free and do not ever require additional oil. Haha

1125 2018-07-06 21:13:54 Why are those who are Anti Devil also pro drilling for oil?
1126 2018-07-06 21:13:53 "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness." What part of the "all-American way" has been proven wrong?
1127 2018-07-06 21:13:43 we might be making progress y’all because the oil change place had female mechanics, everyone was so nice to me, they didn’t overcharge me AND they didn’t make me feel stupid
1128 2018-07-06 21:13:43 Second that, why not ship them off to the middle east so they can protest oil production their.
1129 2018-07-06 21:13:42 stop killing babies to make baby oil
1130 2018-07-06 21:13:16 Burner flame doesn’t ignite pan oil is impressive.  #DefiningBlackCommunity
1131 2018-07-06 21:13:14 It depends if sales of oil goes done they lose their patient
1132 2018-07-06 21:13:14 They need to give you more time. The Canadian dollar is held hostage to the US dollar and oil prices. It can escape the gravity of either.

1134 2018-07-06 21:12:57 The elite Dems have turned the two parties into one.  Watched them align themselves with Netanyahu which is a player in this oil coup. If I mention it I’m accused of being anti blue-why else did Nancy chuck and Harris lull Americans into a state of inaction?
1135 2018-07-06 21:12:52 Trying out MCT oil and I think I can smell color. Good lord what is this stuff.
1136 2018-07-06 21:12:51 Done
1137 2018-07-06 21:12:41 like wtf I went in for an oil change! If they were gonna do this shit they should’ve done it for free
1138 2018-07-06 21:12:40 So sorry to hear that. Have you all tried Marijuana? I hear that the oil, is helping tremendously with seizures. I will pray for your family.
1139 2018-07-06 21:12:32 VAT and petrol going up to put money in the coffers stolen by the govt.also the Rand is weak and oil is expensive.Eskom is bankrupt and therefore can’t give above inflation increases,it can’t afford to offer anything.Cant reason with people who won’t listen.

1145 2018-07-06 21:11:32 Not a good idea. Rather people should use naturally available brain boosters like Walnuts, Almonds, Cod liver Oil, Mackeral, Salmon, Spinach, Berries, etc.

1147 2018-07-06 21:11:18 Are you working hard to stop using palm oil from destroyed forests which should be sequestering carbon AND providing a habitat for numerous wild creatures that have been pushed to the brink
1148 2018-07-06 21:10:53 Piper Alpha disaster was 30 years ago today. 167 people lost their lives in the drive for oil profits. My first academic job was looking at offshore safety.

1149 2018-07-06 21:10:48 V for vitamins as in you can still get all of them w/o dairy consumption.
P for palm oil as in I have done research but I'm curious as to your opinion on it!
I for inclusive as in you don't have to be 1) wealthy or 2) white to be vegan.

1154 2018-07-06 21:10:19 Yeah i read about him a while back and it's sad that he's gone now. There was also 2 men who created their own engines. One ran on water  and one man made an engine that could extend the use of gas. They were both killed because they were a threat to the oil industry

1161 2018-07-06 21:09:38 i do not deserve the anxiety of getting an oil change
1162 2018-07-06 21:09:25 (2) So what you're really saying is that Obama worked MORE time working, but couldn't accomplish anything.

Plus you're inaccurate - Trump worked over 24 hours straight on live TV, and last Sat he was working before 8 am on oil prices, just some examples.

1173 2018-07-06 21:07:41 Question would y'all like to watch a glitter oil show with me? Should I buy the glitter?
1174 2018-07-06 21:07:27 It boils my blood that CNN used to run a counter at the bottom of the screen for how long it took Obama to "fix" the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, yet this story -- entirely of #IQ45's making -- is already disappearing in to the news cycle memory hole.
1175 2018-07-06 21:07:25 So nobody in Houston got no oil ?
1176 2018-07-06 21:07:21 Please do, I got burned with the oil the first time and i don’t want to go through that again 
1177 2018-07-06 21:07:07 When you wait 2 months to get ya oil changed I guess it takes them 2 hours to fix it /:
1178 2018-07-06 21:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1179 2018-07-06 21:06:35 what about the USA friends buying zero oil from Iran in future as S Korea already said.won't buy?
1180 2018-07-06 21:06:26 @BurtsBees makes a bug repellant. You do spray it, but it's more of an oil so it feels nice on your skin and smells great. It's the only thing that works for me and I'm allergic, so of course they come after my hardcore.
1181 2018-07-06 21:06:25 Megan the former stripper was out-performed by Georgia. Megan needed those blow up ducks and a bit of baby oil didn’t she #LoveIsland
1182 2018-07-06 21:06:19 You are advocating for palm oil. Very unvegan. But of course cattle are not the only option to farm land after deforestation. Soy crops are also common. If you pay more for plant foods, those things become the motivators.  Lack of regulation is to blame.  Not cattle farming.
1183 2018-07-06 21:05:59 Ppl worry abt plastic bags, straws, recycling cups. Few worry about or do anything about rampant consumerism, throwaway appliance stuff, deforestation globally, oil sands ecosystem devastation, overfishing, soil loss, water toxicity. We need celebs, leaders to express urgency now

1185 2018-07-06 21:05:49 but having them with some oil and a bit of salt is the shit
1186 2018-07-06 21:05:46 Eg I've been involved in incrementally adding to knowledge of N. Australian geological history through one of my former company's oil exploration activities, to social science through early work in online community formation & across a few other areas. Am not a scientist though!
1187 2018-07-06 21:05:43 I heard it suuuuuper thick and cakey. And you gotta use it with the matching face oil they made seperately. Even then, it clings onto dry patches and sinks into pores  :(
1188 2018-07-06 21:05:34 Done!  Thank you..
1189 2018-07-06 21:05:31 Related, why are all the European countries agreeing to not buy oil from Iran as Trump has dictated? Because they are afraid of what U S would do if they did. Same as to China trying to force them to go against U S on trade. Same conclusion!
1190 2018-07-06 21:05:27 @adamcarolla Ace, I’m looking at buying some MCT oil.  Is there a specific type or brand you recommend?
1191 2018-07-06 21:05:17 Got everyone and retweeted! 

1192 2018-07-06 21:05:07 So @tylerperry bought @TiffanyHaddish a brand new Tesla!  Clearly I need some new friends!  Hell I just want my a/c, my windshield oil & coolant leak fixed on my 02 Tahoe! 
1193 2018-07-06 21:05:05 "And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out." ~Matthew 25:8 #Jesus #God #Bible
1194 2018-07-06 21:05:04 The amount of oil artists on YouTube/Instagram who follow/give out bad safety info or don't touch on safety at all, is kinda scary. FLAMES NEAR SOLVENTS & OIL RAG HELL - THAT'S A HAPPY LITTLE ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN
1195 2018-07-06 21:05:01 @RootingBranches had an idea. Coconut oil as a butter sub for the bananas foster. Also, shes not sure if the Kahlua is vegan because some liquors arent vegan.
1196 2018-07-06 21:05:00 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
1197 2018-07-06 21:04:58 Um, I'm pretty sure that has mostly been OPEC! And we wouldn't have to deal with them if the idiotic tree huggers would stop handcuffing our country's oil producers & let them drill where our own oil supplies are!
Be nice with that "screw you" stuff. Ever hear of karma?
1198 2018-07-06 21:04:51 hahahaha  I use MTC oil and butter for my coffee  .. but thanks for the heads up
1199 2018-07-06 21:04:51 Would be nice for more government control on these oil tycoons.  There is no reason for gas prices to be going up other then corporate greed.    What happened to all the gas reserves they had from fracking?  There’s no way to cry for a fuel shortage.
1200 2018-07-06 21:04:46 I'm a fan but it would be useful to be specific. Big Oil is a special interest, but arguably so is a group that advocates for equal education access for poor kids. Do you see a difference? Does it matter whether the "special interest" in question is spending to enrich itself?
1201 2018-07-06 21:04:45 Cbd oil helps a lot I swear
1202 2018-07-06 21:04:29 @JenBriney in your recent episode on Venezuela I believe you claimed that a strike caused significant damage to the oil infrastructure there, however I cannot find a corresponding link in the show notes. Could you pllllllease clarify for me. <3
1203 2018-07-06 21:04:11 Martinez was a winner at Wigan because he didn’t achieve much success at @Everton doesn’t make him less of a gud coach and he is proving dat at d highest level now
1204 2018-07-06 21:03:55 China has none to speak of, running over your civilians with tanks don't count. What would they do for oil, food, trade, the list goes on and on. Sorry just not buying it.    
2 of 2
1205 2018-07-06 21:03:45 You realize that is part of the plan. Instead oil from OPEC you will now get it from Russia. Their takeover begins and Republicans are too blind and stupid to see it happening. Too late once it has started. So much for sanctions
1206 2018-07-06 21:03:40 Hylaronic acid serum helps balance out the moisture in your face and keeps your skin from over producing oils. I have very acne prone skin and also use mineral oil cream at night. The extended wear let's it soak up and gives good hydration without the residue
1207 2018-07-06 21:03:34 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?

1213 2018-07-06 21:02:15 Any crop that can be processed into cooking oil (soy beans etc.) can be, and has been, made into biodegradable plastic.
1214 2018-07-06 21:02:12 Ugh. Too much oil... Oh, that's great. Yeah, take a few hundred dollars' worth if you want me to individually engrave your names on each of my other enemy.
1215 2018-07-06 21:01:55 I thought Sonoco was a oil company?   oops.  on face
1216 2018-07-06 21:01:53 Oh lort. Now I'm picturing the dwarves at a beauty salon a la Oz. Oil their beards, sharpen their axes. Elves. Elves are involved I swear.
1217 2018-07-06 21:01:34 Did I prevent a white dude from cutting in line for an oil change? Yes, thanks, no regrets.

1223 2018-07-06 21:00:48 cucumbers, ice cold black/green tea bags, almond oil, ice cold spoons might help but it might be possible that the dark cicles are in your genetics and you cant really get rid of then but just try it out
1224 2018-07-06 21:00:43 Trump wants to destroy it for an oil refinery I'm sure your okay with that
1225 2018-07-06 21:00:42 Got them all! Thx!
1226 2018-07-06 21:00:40 Don't you just love going to you're get oil changed and the mechanic tells you, you need new breaks, tires etc.... lmao fuck me
1227 2018-07-06 21:00:37 WHY DO THEY NEED PALM OIL? Bc it’s cheaper for companies!!! What happens when they burn down these forests??? Thousands of species lose their homes, their lives!!!! When these trees burn down the carbon dioxide they were trying to clear for us is once again up in the air
1228 2018-07-06 21:00:20 Hmm  olive oil as a coating before flouring should honestly work as well.
1229 2018-07-06 21:00:19 if i don’t go get this oil change my ass will be in the house tomorrow

1235 2018-07-06 20:59:57 dump must have promised each GOPer in Congress some percentage of the Rosneft oil deal--they are all traitors, sellouts, and compromised.

1239 2018-07-06 20:59:36 today i used my oil change receipt to write comments on from an elected official in an interview while I was digging for a adapter in my car so I could plug in borrowed headphones to my stupid iphone. What I am saying is Apple you really screwed me with taking the jack away
1240 2018-07-06 20:59:21 Oh boy. We're going to have to agree to disagree. You can believe conspiracy theorists and oil&gas execs who pay politicians to feed you lies. I'm sticking with the scientific experts out there!
1241 2018-07-06 20:59:04 I’ve had a sample of the oil and the night serum. And I do like them. 
1242 2018-07-06 20:59:01 How much for beard oil?
1243 2018-07-06 20:58:58 I would love to see oil and gas go away. Only pollutants to our environment and it’s already destroying the planet. Hemp is the way to go, more focus needs to be put on it .
1244 2018-07-06 20:58:55 water ways into toxic dumping grounds, not to mention putting together shady deals & kickbacks like the White Fish deal in Puerto Rico & the Italian/Russian oil deal off coast of Alaska.
1245 2018-07-06 20:58:37 Kai Mallam
1246 2018-07-06 20:58:34 And how much of a mark up does America pay on the oil it buys from Canada? Oh that's right the US pays less for Canadian oil then Canadians do. Sounds fair
1247 2018-07-06 20:58:31 Don’t give up! It’s what you put on before your makeup so it can stay all day..mattifying primers gone keep your oil under control
1248 2018-07-06 20:58:23 and the idiots clap and cheer just how dumb are these people who go to his rallies he is nothing more than a snake oil salesman who needs to be rode out of town on a rail...
1249 2018-07-06 20:58:14 Love my chiropractor for my scoliosis but i would say there’s a v strong correlation between essential oil enthusiasts and anti vaccine peeps! OnGuard will ward of measles right??
1250 2018-07-06 20:57:58 My dad changed my oil, put gas in my car, cleaned it, changed my blinker that went out, and changed my tail light.... wwuutt
1251 2018-07-06 20:57:44 You forgot about Mexican tariffs. Libs always forget about Mexico unless it's the tearing children out of arms bit. Fighting for fair trade is the correct thing to do. Oil prices?What drives oil prices? Supply & demand. Lastly, the election *results were not compromised. #ICallBS
1252 2018-07-06 20:57:35 Yes you have to try!! It’s coconut oil mixed with essential oils for the muscles. And the scent

1255 2018-07-06 20:57:23 Where can i get a oil change ?
1256 2018-07-06 20:57:16 Nothing puts this girl in a more sour mood than seeing gas prices increase by $0.14/L in an hour. Seriously? You've got to be kidding. The price of oil does not justify this. #taxgreed #EnoughIsEnough

1263 2018-07-06 20:55:47 found a Nissan dealer able to service my car, but not entirely at ease: service advisor asks me “so what do you need done on your Leaf today? Oil change?” .... I say ”uh, nope, it’s electric...” he stared profoundly empty at me  - @ElectricJen @bonnienorman @She_sElectric
1264 2018-07-06 20:55:39 Carpeted apartments that dont allow ANYTHING stored outside... had one, sucked to have to put the dirty wheels on the carpet every day.
1265 2018-07-06 20:55:00 The biggest failure of our current federal govt @liberal_party @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna is they have $12B for an oil pipeline but no money for a nationwide EV/Solar program.
1266 2018-07-06 20:54:44 Well, we're in CA. Shit out here is POTENT! We make THC oil and then bake with it.

1269 2018-07-06 20:54:40 When, oh Lord, when are you going to strike these men down? It'd be so much more satisfying to the watching world, as opposed to assuming that after death they will boil in oil for eternity. I'll trade a lightning strike now, and forget about an eternity of punishment.
1270 2018-07-06 20:54:29 Are you advocating for palm oil?
1271 2018-07-06 20:54:26 oh yeah cod liver oil tablets with milk at school!
1272 2018-07-06 20:54:15 She's right though. Sliced onions with just a little bit of salt and olive oil over night in the crockpot is the way to go.
1273 2018-07-06 20:54:05 @JennaJulien podcast idea: segue off but using the snake oil products. belt candy we are cops
1274 2018-07-06 20:53:59 Even new stuff needs preventative maintenance. Just like a new car, you  have to change the oil, tires, and brakes or you will not get the most  out of your investment, and in a gyms case, you members will suffer as  well.

With what do you want to replace palm oil?

And as already said, grazing causes much more deforestation than palm oil, despite the fact that most meat comes from factory farms.

1313 2018-07-06 20:49:00 I take beta blockers, blood pressure pills, Pregabalin, many supplements 

Would CBD oil interact with any of those? I thought I remembered being told my beta blockers and BP pills might.?

1315 2018-07-06 20:48:37 We don't lose.  Neither does any one else.    That's preposterous.

China is not the only supplier.

It's just nonsense.

And frankly, if YOU believe we are SO dependent on China, then that's all the more reason to break from it.  Maybe you weren't around for the oil embargo.

1369 2018-07-06 20:41:24 Yeah, I think so.  That wasn't the exciting part.  Meeting Tommy Hearns was more exciting than checking the oil on his car.
1370 2018-07-06 20:41:20 I like it lol. Well not the fact that u are swishing bacteria around in your mouth but the taste of the coconut oil lol
1371 2018-07-06 20:41:06 I don’t blame them, I was just hoping for someone Less skilled in protecting the oil and gas industry and more incompetent than Pruitt. Oh well here we go again

1379 2018-07-06 20:39:57 Totally agree with @Evan_McMullin. Doesn’t matter that Pruitt was corrupt as long as he was producing output coveted by oil industries et al, ie, undo everything Obama administration had done to protect the environment. @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH
1380 2018-07-06 20:39:57 I don't really believe that of course. But you get the idea. POC and thise marginalized by today's bay area are priority #1. But as a serviced base economy I worry about anyone who, cuts lawns, changes oil, builders, maintenance workers. How do they live?
1381 2018-07-06 20:39:57 From what I can find, Norway is heavily reliant on oil exports for the prosperity of its economy, and has extensive social programs. Basically Venezuela right before its collapse.
1382 2018-07-06 20:39:55 I had a similar problem last year. Fixed by stopping at my local oil change place and paying $20 to have them put Freon in the car. That help?

1389 2018-07-06 20:39:20 A trade war with most other countries doesn't hurt the rich, Agriculture (farmers) is taking the hit from China, your national parks are being fired in to just to make oil companies more profit at the expense of clean water and air due to rollbacks at the EPA...
1390 2018-07-06 20:39:14 To rescue those soccer team boys, how about oil drilling equipment to make a hole to pump oxygen down there?
1391 2018-07-06 20:39:11 You’ll note that is simplistic thinking. There are many motivations for deforestation. Societal wealth is the main one.   It is why I don’t counter your point with palm oil deforestation  and blame on plant foods. If it was not cattle in the Amazon it would be something else.
1392 2018-07-06 20:39:10 But it would be in eastern Canada and of course that wld never do. Unlike the oil industry Mr Trudeau will cover it.

1394 2018-07-06 20:38:58 They’re unrelated. Gas prices are up because the economy is expanding and demand is high. Iran sells no oil to the United States. Also, most of the oil consumed by America is actually from America.
1395 2018-07-06 20:38:55 You know, they could start using American oil and gas instead of their own refineries, pass a $1 gas tax, and Californians would still come out ahead.

1401 2018-07-06 20:37:55 You should give in pretty quickly....the tenders are good...especially if the oil is fresh....I'm all about the Popeyes blackened tenders too though...either way you're doing it right
1402 2018-07-06 20:37:37 Too bad that some people are so idiotic, they can't see the obvious. Taken by a snake oil salesman. Truly pathetic
1403 2018-07-06 20:37:27 Vote for this Okie at the top. I didn't vote for him, but still had to put up with his tax money-wasting, big oil ass-kissing, good-old boy shenanigans. Now my only concern is that he'll want to move back and go back to f*cking things up (more) in Oklahoma.

It simply didn't occur to them that they should do the same with their (almost entirely) unearned windfalls

If you don't have almond oil or if you have nut allergy's then you could use coconut oil. Apply on your hair focusing on the ends. Leave it for about 1 hour and remove with shampoo.

1444 2018-07-06 20:32:23 I’d maybe dial back my estimation of the boomer take over to ‘92 (coincidentally, the time that they took over in the states, hello Bill). But I think blaming them for the 80s, not to mention the North Sea oil debacle, is pushing it.

1536 2018-07-06 20:21:52 Well, you're right but the issue here is sustainability. You can't demand peace from the Turkana in the advent of oil exploration when the very concept of it is simply unknown to them. There has to be a way in which the oil can benefit them, even though they've had nothing to do

1539 2018-07-06 20:21:08 @NaturesBounty I used the Ultra Man multi pack but you discontinued it. Did you also get rid of Dual Spectrum Coq10 with Krill Oil? Also why do you do that? 
1540 2018-07-06 20:21:07 Yea you right. 
He is a sneaky, mean minded and wicked old man who should be sitting somewhere spending the money he got from all those oil deals h’es been involved in over the years.

1546 2018-07-06 20:20:40 CBD or just hemp oil (Nutiva etc) - all nutrients play a role, magnesium in particular. B vitamins, other minerals, fatty acids, vitamins C and  E. Avoid chemicals, processed foods, fluoride.
1547 2018-07-06 20:20:36 History lesson dummy. King idris was a puppet of Britain when Ghadaffi came to power in 1969 he nationalize libyas oil sector as a result the country has no external debt. Now you do the math
1548 2018-07-06 20:20:18 Payload Pruitt is off to a high paying job with the oil companies.
1549 2018-07-06 20:20:10 Oh, I almost forgot - on the 19th June 2018 Tilray introduced a new high CBD medicinal cannabis oil - not a bit like skunk.
1550 2018-07-06 20:20:03 I don’t know. You need to mix the chocolate with oil to use it with the fountain. 
1551 2018-07-06 20:19:55 Someone teach me to do an oil change lol
1552 2018-07-06 20:19:43 Popcorns are prepared with the same pot, under the same heat, with the same oil but they don’t pop out the same time dont compare urself with others
1553 2018-07-06 20:19:43 Do you know how much oil it takes to go green?
1554 2018-07-06 20:19:40 Japanese curry is good, but it's more like a gravy. It has ketchup, oil, and flour in it. I still enjoy it.

1556 2018-07-06 20:19:34 I’m at the Toyota dealership getting my oil changed and Fox News is on the tv, but I feel like I couldn’t change it bc I’d then be the girl in the flowery dress and heart shaped sunglasses who turned of Fox News.
1557 2018-07-06 20:19:14 Dilute the citronella oil in water and buy a cheap spray yoke from body shop or Penney’s the blitz it all over after your shower - don’t use any other deodorant or perfume - works for @Mister_DW

1559 2018-07-06 20:19:12 Last question for a hat:

@SafetyKleen collects used oil and re-refines it into Performance Plus Motor Oil. How many gallons of oil do we recycle per year? 

(Closest guess in the next 30 minutes wins)
1560 2018-07-06 20:19:05 In fairness the Oilers, with possible exception of Kassian, do not handle fragile projects well. Columbus does much better in that regard. If I am Duclair I choose CBJ, too, if the money is in the ballpark. Saw him play in Tucson. Don't think Oil could salvage that player.
1561 2018-07-06 20:19:03 a few years ago Lady and I bought a kitchen table and chairs at Goodwill for $80 total. Its a great table but was covered in horrible oil paint. Today I started refinishing it. I found the makers stamp under the paint. Looked up the retail cost. $10,500. !!!!!!!!!

1565 2018-07-06 20:18:49 thank you @aquariaofficial for being the cause of that oil slick @ladygaga photoshoot back on my feed
1566 2018-07-06 20:18:49 There is approx $500 Billion untapped Russian oil. To hard for con artist trump to pass and will lift sanctions to allow  drilling. In return trump collects “fee” and gets his Moscow trump hotel.
1567 2018-07-06 20:18:43 No, they don’t - what’s worse is that whistleblowing & unsafe acts reporting are still frowned upon, & anything that happens is “settled” quickly. But, on the plus, health&safety in industrial operations (process safety) was started by the oil&gas industry and  leading the way
1568 2018-07-06 20:18:34 Lastly one recently I found thats bomb is called blonde obsession by devoted creations. Oil and gluten free and has skin firming and cellulite fighting agents in it. I recommend all I listed lol. Great tan extenders are the hempz sea salt and sandlewood scent or BOOST by norvell
1569 2018-07-06 20:18:33 Oil? Wait, no, something non-flammable that works like oil.

1585 2018-07-06 20:15:40 I’m surprised he hasn’t turned that “counter-terrorism” jet into a “counter-capitalism” jet, to take him to all those great socialist places in the world! I’m sure the jet runs on peanut oil, wouldn’t want to harm the environment!
1586 2018-07-06 20:15:33 Either all or nobody could export oil and gas through Hormoz Strait!
1587 2018-07-06 20:15:30 Make it, like, oil wrestling and you can have another Trump Gender Watch.
1588 2018-07-06 20:15:28 That's OK. After all, Rome was not built in a day. It's private money. These communities have had oil under their feet for millennia yet cry exploitation when others come to drill for it using tech they innovated and invented.
1589 2018-07-06 20:15:25 LNA omega-3 acids are found in plants yes. EPA and DHA are only found in fish oil and LNA must be converted to EPA for biological effects and the human body doesn't convert it very well.

1591 2018-07-06 20:15:16 I don’t use coconut oil bc I don’t like how oily it makes my hair lol. I use shea moisture leave in conditioner every here and there, and regular shea moisture conditioner whenever I wash my hair.
1592 2018-07-06 20:15:01 Over 2 hours for an oil change but I'm glad I just got it done...

1600 2018-07-06 20:13:55 Very concerning, as is pipeline issue and domestic oil usuage. Hopefully this brings Canadians together for a made in Canada strategy.

1606 2018-07-06 20:13:22 Ah i see Alberta is still practicing 'regulation theatre' - establishing regs they have no intention of enforcing... 

As proof:
- regs on tailing ponds
- regs on land reclamation 
- regs on abandoned wells

Lax enforcement is just another subsidy for big oil...
1607 2018-07-06 20:13:21 Ha ha - well dinner was a mussels & prawns  in a lemon cream coconut oil sauce, followed by ribeye steak with a stilton butter topping.  I did manage one cauli florette, 1/4 carrot and half an onion and 3 mushrooms as well though :) Jolly nice it was too (my first food in 24 hrs)
1608 2018-07-06 20:13:17 The different colours suggest that the soil was extensively disturbed. The creatures must have been extraordinary diggers. There’s also a kind of oil completely different to earlier deposits. It’s almost like something took the earlier deposits and changed them.

1613 2018-07-06 20:12:41 The only impact Morata would have made would be to put up a miss of the season contender and to pour 50 Goya oil bottle contents on his head

1620 2018-07-06 20:11:33 what essential oil do I use to quit saying “I feel that” in response to everything
1621 2018-07-06 20:11:30 Where is the tooth paste?
Is this the right oil for popping popcorn?

Perhaps I just naturally look like one of those "helpful smiles in every aisle"?
1622 2018-07-06 20:11:29 With a big difference, Trump supporters are angry against the liberal US media because they are biased against Trump. I'm criticising the media because the US military industrial complex and the oil industry owns it and they tried to overthrow the Venezuelan gov for decades
1623 2018-07-06 20:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a pain in the ass. So brutal.

Just tried @costcocanada Kirkland Hazelnut Spread
Can't walk by jar without sticking spoon of it in my mouth. Also NO Palm Oil!
A lot looser, but so tasty.
1626 2018-07-06 20:10:33 Ok but it works! You can do it all over too if they seem itchy; just wash well after. Tumeric, olive oil, and hot water make a great anti inflammatory “gravy” too. Yeah, I’m THAT dog mom
1627 2018-07-06 20:10:27 Epsom salt. And essential oil or scented body wash if you like your baths to be scented.

1631 2018-07-06 20:10:09 Are you allergic to CBD oil? It's amazing.

1634 2018-07-06 20:10:01 Because it won’t be profitable soon enough. The economics don’t make sense. We forget the oil pipeline was built during rising oil prices, gas prices are declining to steady (meaning additional supply will likely diminish price)

1637 2018-07-06 20:09:35 It depends. You have to look at a miner's feasibility study and then take an average from a few miners. I've heard the all-in sustaining cost for most miners is in the $14s for silver. But with oil prices up, that metric changes.
1638 2018-07-06 20:09:11 coconut oil is a scam
1639 2018-07-06 20:09:02 Probably got a bottle of baby oil on
1640 2018-07-06 20:08:53 The brightest! Just like an oil derrick on fire.
1641 2018-07-06 20:08:45 Not allowing Iran to export oil is already a form of warfare, their economy heavily depends on oil and gas trade.
1642 2018-07-06 20:08:39 Try cannabis oil.
1643 2018-07-06 20:08:32 Oh, I'm sure they had 'good' reasons & I'll bet they're all going to walk away from this a lot richer. Start following the oil & gas money.
1644 2018-07-06 20:08:30 Oloshi go drink oil
1645 2018-07-06 20:08:25 Yep, and there are plenty of vape/oil ways (non-fire) to get thc into your lungs now.

1650 2018-07-06 20:07:41 Arrogant ignorant fool.
You people don't understand the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. The west made Iranian deal without asking approval from countries like Israel Saudi Egypt Jordan etc. You only think: we need oil. Let them kill each other.
1651 2018-07-06 20:07:15 I did an olive oil rinse and condition today. My hair is so freaking soft

1656 2018-07-06 20:06:44 Glad you found the post helpful! CBD oil is one of the best canine solutions we’ve found for both pain and anxiety. It really deserves its own entire blog post so keep an eye out for a cbd post in the future.

1660 2018-07-06 20:06:02 *cough cough cough* 

Me: all night I had to hear that. Any more of that and you'll hack up oil!!


1661 2018-07-06 20:06:01 The worst is that only those who didn’t follow the evacuation procedures survived. It’s a fact that #PiperAlpha30 completely changed the oil&gas safety procedures across the world, partially thanks to an incredible man I’ve had the honour to meet - Lord Cullen
1662 2018-07-06 20:05:54 Finally got my oil 
1663 2018-07-06 20:05:49 I first purchased face wash to check if it won't have any side effect on my face instead it treated me well. So I now use toner, oil and day cream.
1664 2018-07-06 20:05:46 When I come for you now, you'll be doing like there's engine oil in your brain.

Let me just Kpim.

1669 2018-07-06 20:05:19 True, however sabotaging Iran's oil trade is already a form of declaration of oil. Iran's economy heavily depends on oil and gas exports,
1670 2018-07-06 20:05:08 It's just been hell the last couple of days for no reason! Peppermint oil capsules have been my friend! x

1673 2018-07-06 20:05:04 Companies need to invest in the much-needed transformation of the palm oil sector by achieving third-party verification of their supply chains instead of second-party alternatives that lack the independence, oversight and transparency...1/2

1687 2018-07-06 20:03:10 Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness; let him rebuke me—it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds.

1692 2018-07-06 20:02:27 "A lot of good was done" for oil, gas, chemical executives and other corporations that pollute the earth.  For the rest of us, not so much.
1693 2018-07-06 20:02:08 Cynicism aside - Yes, agreed. Let's hope others follow. I've been wondering why coal and oil companies haven't done this earlier. Strategically, they should want to diversify their revenue streams. Maybe they are just now realizing the bulk of that fight is over.
1694 2018-07-06 20:02:07 Watch for oil leaking after.
1695 2018-07-06 20:01:52 Imagine being somewhere far from home, unrescuable, hundreds of feet above a freezing ocean that is on fire, where condensate has exploded through an oil platform. 165 out of 220 crew were killed. God forgive those that allowed  #PiperAlpha30 to happen. #oil #OOTT #energy #gas
1696 2018-07-06 20:01:46 bush was a puppet for the oil industry. it wasn't much better. he was evil beyond evil.
1697 2018-07-06 20:01:35 Isn't that the usual US dirty trick procedure: starve them with sanctions then steal their oil.
1698 2018-07-06 20:01:15 I'm a free speech absolutist. People shouldn't use force (aka "Laws") to influence what sounds come from my mouth. What's your stance on boiling people alive in vats of oil?

1702 2018-07-06 20:00:47 @BirchboxUK Hi, I have a yearly subscription that I got for my daughter. She has a nut allergy so can’t have products with almond oil or any other nuts. Cocunut is fine as it’s not a nut. She got my box today but the scrub has walnut and almond oil in so can’t use it.

1705 2018-07-06 20:00:22 Rifle season is right around the corner. Make sure you keep your guns nice and clean by oiling them every once in a while and running a patch with oil down the barrel. This will prevent rust and keep your gun moving smoothly.

1707 2018-07-06 19:59:26 A little salt in with the oil helps the ‘massage’ work better as well

But I’ve only done it a couple of times (to get my mom to endure eating it), personally, I like the bitterness.
1708 2018-07-06 19:59:18 @JLR_News 5 hours later finally got back to work - was charged over £400 to regenerate DPF and oil and filter change as this was driver error. Despite dozens of calls to JLR customer services and sheer ineptitude on their part - they finally told me today that i was liable

1736 2018-07-06 19:54:13 Celebrated Lilli's 9th birthday by coming to #OneStoneIsland. The place is teeming with ticks so unfortunately I had to put the tick repellent oil on her neck and she loathes it. Poor lil buddy...
1737 2018-07-06 19:54:04 ALSO if you have an aloe vera plant try and squeeze the gel from a couple of leaves into a mould & add some lavender oil then freeze!! rub it onto any burned areas and it can help promote healing and cool the area!!
1738 2018-07-06 19:53:57 I am all for it, New York not happy with oil, just don’t send them anymore.
1739 2018-07-06 19:53:46 Tue, but overall, I still think the picture's pretty crap where the boomers are concerned, not least with the gargantuan free cash they got on privatisation, selling council homes and North sea oil (as well as massive increased debt) which they basically splurged.
1740 2018-07-06 19:53:43 Alright so I got like a 2 hour wait time for an oil change  somebody entertain me please

1751 2018-07-06 19:52:52 So I'm getting my car serviced for an oil change and I have my no flags up. When the guy pulls up with my car and gets out he asks me what country is the flag from? 
1752 2018-07-06 19:52:28 Obviously (see previous comment). Size restriction of Tweets force a lack of detail. We need more Canadian Oil & Gas distributed on the planet as we work our way down the enviro.Chain over the coming decades.
1753 2018-07-06 19:52:18 I did my first oil painting and I’m actually really proud of it
1754 2018-07-06 19:52:18 absolutely agree with WWII- nothing justified since. its about oil, protecting poppy fields, or whatever they make up.
you miss the point of the story... after serving he got educated and now wouldnt recommend to anyone.

1757 2018-07-06 19:51:53 @ValentineShow I still haven’t heard him say our gas prices would go down with us pumping our own oil, but we would SELL the oil to others and make a good profit being $10 cheaper a barrel!  When are we going to take care of our consumers in this country?
1758 2018-07-06 19:51:49 Wonder why they are shit scared of us.Oil ?
1759 2018-07-06 19:51:44 Oooooo. So I’m at valvoline getting an oil change... This beautiful chocolate man just asked for my number ........ I’m shoooookkkkkk

1766 2018-07-06 19:50:44 Oh no :(  I would imagine vegetable oil or similar would be your best bet.

1786 2018-07-06 19:47:21 And suddenly there was a Tory MP at my daughters first orchestra performance. To give a thank you speech. I cannot look at him and not see a slimey little Tory snake oil salesman.

1791 2018-07-06 19:46:22 Sorry for your loss.Cannabis oil is the key for a cure but it’s not in the best interests for the greedy immoral soulless bastards in power. One day health will come before wealth.
1792 2018-07-06 19:46:18 Oil companies? Tech giants? De-foresters?
1793 2018-07-06 19:45:41 10% OFF Blue Roots Oil Cartridges!
1794 2018-07-06 19:45:40 I know this feeling. I've been having them since I was 6. When I was in Haiti they used to prescribe me SupraB and Dolo neurobion(something like that). When I came to the states I used to take excedrin a lot but then stop. Now Peppermint oil is my best friend.
1795 2018-07-06 19:45:24 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1796 2018-07-06 19:44:51 i’m getting my oil changed i hear nigga say “man we needa get time and half on our birthday, that’ll be fire”

1799 2018-07-06 19:44:16 Simply put this is NOT sound Christian teaching nor anything even close. This man is a 'snake oil' salesman.
1800 2018-07-06 19:44:13 he looks like an ecstatic saint from the badly lit studio of an aspiring baroque painter who decided to experiment and now he wishes he didn't but the eggyolk-mixed-with-oil paint already dried and he has to deliver this piece to the pub tomorrow bc he owes the owner
1801 2018-07-06 19:44:00 Hmmmm, my gas and oil.  I'm loving all these gas/oil connections.

Glencore was founded by Marc Rich, right?
1802 2018-07-06 19:43:50 You sure did drive it... till ya ran out of oil and blew er up 
1803 2018-07-06 19:43:47 Think of the end product ... olives, a sweet red wine, fine selection of breads and olive oil
1804 2018-07-06 19:43:46 Most food (including most fries) still have some water and sometimes microbial in them after cooking. With McDonald's fries they are so thin that the oil easily kills off any microbes and pulls out most of the water. It's hard to grow bacteria in a dry sterile place.

-Supporters of Ocasio are those who know your Russiagate conspiracy is Alex Jones level nonsense

and

-Ocasio won

Doesn't that mean you're just some fringe psycho peddling snake oil to a tiny Twitter echo chamber?
1813 2018-07-06 19:42:06 Francis’s oil is being changed rn because apparently that’s what you have to do or else the “check engine light goes on” and you’re “an adult now and should be on top of this” and you “shouldn’t have waited this long” hey watch it buddy I’m doing my best
1814 2018-07-06 19:42:06 Hey, @jiffylube, just went and got my oil changed and the techs weren't able to check and reset my engine light. They said it was 'illegal' to and when pressed they made an excuse that they didn't have the right thing to even check my codes. It's got a standard plug. WTF, guys?
1815 2018-07-06 19:42:02  Mate, my new thing (new to me/ apparently what they do in Spain) is the wrap the iberico ham around the picos de pan (bread sticks, made with salt and olive oil) it’s amazing, glass of (new) house recommended wine (Anjou blanc) X

Topple oil dictatorships
1817 2018-07-06 19:41:35 *pours a bucket of oil all over the beefy owl stud and rubs the oil in with my strong leathery eagle hands*.
1818 2018-07-06 19:41:21 If you are using anything that has a relationship to oil or gas in any way, you are complicit, so admitting that, you should also be charged?
1819 2018-07-06 19:41:10 If one makes from a little extra cooking oil.
1820 2018-07-06 19:41:03 could it have been cooked in coconut oil? not sure if that would cause it. I'm glad that you are okay
1821 2018-07-06 19:41:01 Go go kart racing, get oil for my car (whatever mobil1 he wants me to use), talk about nascar and his time with RCR and SHR. I would definitely ask about Sr. Talk about kids and give him something for his kids.
1822 2018-07-06 19:41:01 I dont kniw her, but you do
1823 2018-07-06 19:40:43 I gotta go get my oil change 
1824 2018-07-06 19:40:30 見回り行ってきまーす！
1825 2018-07-06 19:40:27 I go to the @LALGBTCenter four times a week for free treatment and I'm uninsured!  Takes a while to get in, and you got to be a squeaky wheel to get the oil, but life saving for me
1826 2018-07-06 19:40:26 Have you tried semi deep frying it in coconut oil with salt and turmeric?
1827 2018-07-06 19:40:24 my hair suck up oil so fast it’s ridiculous 
1828 2018-07-06 19:40:20 On top of that the region lacks energy (oil/lithium/cobalt) and other resources vs LatAm, Aussie, Africa, ME for source of wealth/income. Instead, we have million of low skilled population and no resources. I'd the the future is who ever controls food + water + energy. 2/2
1829 2018-07-06 19:40:15 2) Ok folks, here goes nothing:  back in the 70's we had oil embargoes, farmer and dairy bailouts, and trade wars.  Apparently history does repeat itself when people don't read.  But the dumbing down of America isn't from Dems/Progressives.  Those with money figure they are
1830 2018-07-06 19:40:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1831 2018-07-06 19:40:00 This GENTLEMAN-not even goin call him a nigga, changed my oil, gave me food money, bought me a pillow for his crib, fills my tank, and told me what the fuck it is and ain't!! 

I'm basically engaged now. Don't talk to me
1832 2018-07-06 19:39:48 I hate oil so much...
1833 2018-07-06 19:39:36 This hoe ass Walmart still don’t have that black seed oil I been looking for
1834 2018-07-06 19:39:28 En el directo de ayer en Sonic Mania, Tails estaba muy potente jajajajaja, derroto al Death Egg Robot, derroto a Metal, Presiono la capsula apenas salio en pantalla en Hydrocity y se cargo un tentaculo en el jefe de Oil Ocean sin parar de golpearle y q ni siquiera le habia pegado
1835 2018-07-06 19:39:25 Wowwwuuu! when you leave your natural hair alone and give it constant oil and water it really flourishes
1836 2018-07-06 19:39:17 1) Ok folks here goes nothing:  back in the 70's we had oil embargoes, farmer and dairy bailouts, and trade wars.  Apparently, history does repeat itself when people don't read.  But the dumbing down of America isn't from Dems/Progressives.  Those with money figure they
1837 2018-07-06 19:39:17 Yo who knows how to check the oil in ur car
1838 2018-07-06 19:39:16 Idk if you've heard of the "hot/cold" food concept, but essentially if im breaking out i avoid a lot of "hot" food that causes hormone spikes, i.e. chicken, dairy, nuts like peanuts and pistachios. Product wise, for hormonal acne tea tree oil and charcoal masks really work for me
1839 2018-07-06 19:39:16 You missed the point. This president does these rallies like a snake oil salesman wanting to only entertain and humiliate people. What does that have to do with conducting legitimate business for our country?
1840 2018-07-06 19:39:14 Belgium leaking oil all over the damn place
1841 2018-07-06 19:39:13 There’s an old Jackie Mason routine which has the punchline something like “typical Jewish luck, if we had turned left, we’d have got the oil, we turned right and got the oranges”
1842 2018-07-06 19:38:56 Gas tank is full
Oil changed
Inspection is done 
Car washed 
1843 2018-07-06 19:38:14 I’ve heard midnight oil’s “beds are burning”’ twice already. #iamhome
1844 2018-07-06 19:38:12 @janisfrayer other jet engines could be fixed on a tank and they can put the tank there by helicopter. the same way they "blowed away" the burning oil in Iraq too.

1850 2018-07-06 19:37:26 I was like wrong place to be racist... in the oil... 
1851 2018-07-06 19:37:16 That’s Tyrella Beach, unfortunately due to @thealso Panda leaking oil that day all cars are banned.  Fun fact, I lost my virginity on that beach in a DAF 66.  Which is what I am sexually aroused by elastic bands even to this day.
1852 2018-07-06 19:36:56 Ah, yes, the famous Israeli oil fields.
1853 2018-07-06 19:36:53 There is no scientific basis whatsoever for determining "ancestry" through somatic DNA in any manner resembling this. It's completely subjective interpretation and snake oil.
1854 2018-07-06 19:36:43 Brazil wan kill Belgium, this coach needs to make a change
1855 2018-07-06 19:36:17 Stop by Ampersand Oil & Vinegar Tap House Lewiston to grab a delicious boxed dinner before heading over to Sound Downtown with Shiloh Sherrard & The Young Guns tonight!
1856 2018-07-06 19:36:16 Tanning oil, pineapple slices and cute life guards. Summmer the way it was meant to be.
1857 2018-07-06 19:36:15 hate eating all this damn oil 
1858 2018-07-06 19:36:06 No wonder with all the oil money aso lol xx

1861 2018-07-06 19:36:01 and the shortage of food and medicines began in 2007, with de oil price in 90$, so invent another excuse please.
1862 2018-07-06 19:36:01 @realDonaldTrump Help please, in Venezuela there is no food, there are no medicines, the oil industry is ruined. The communist plague of Maduro kills Venezuelans with hunger, please help, communism is death.
1863 2018-07-06 19:35:27 Why aren't we buying American Oil?
1864 2018-07-06 19:35:25 Thoughts I have getting an oil change:
Does anyone else like the smell of tires or is that just me.
1865 2018-07-06 19:35:24 Declan MacManus says: Check! Check! Check! 
Please look into taking iodine supplements and CBD oil... both kill cancer and are necessary for cell energy. Get Well NOW!
1866 2018-07-06 19:35:08 Some stuff I don't understand so can't really explain either, and an oil change and the motor that moves the driver's seat has to be replaced
1867 2018-07-06 19:34:54 I use Eucerin intensive repair (contains AHA) mixed with my favorite body oil. I love it

1870 2018-07-06 19:34:03 There should be a backstage vending machine filled with replacement mutes, pencils, valve oil, slide cream, strings, rosin, key pads, bow ties, socks and stockings. #Supplies #convenience
1871 2018-07-06 19:33:56 Isn’t Sunoco like gas/oil?
1872 2018-07-06 19:33:46 Donald Trump is an ignoramus and a serial liar. He has flim flamed middle America and the Deep South with his #MAGA snake oil and because he is inarticulate they think he is “one of us.” How uniformed is that?  Well done racist Rep Steve King. Iowa soy bean farmers? Burn crops.
1873 2018-07-06 19:33:28 Love when an oil change turns into a reality check on how much is actually wrong with my car 
1874 2018-07-06 19:33:23 Let’s all raise a glass to the departure of Scott Prushit from government service.  May his return to OK be welcomed by the oil and gas industry so they can, with his assistance, continue to maintain OK as the state with the most earthquakes.  
Good luck OK. You’re gonna need it.
1875 2018-07-06 19:32:47 Aye last day of my sale for Pure Romance products! All you river goers check out Body Dew it’s on sale for $10, a natural mosquito repellents with leaving a light oil on your skin (perfect for tanning) and great on tattoos!
1876 2018-07-06 19:32:38 tea tree oil. use pure tea tree oil. most people say to dilute it but that shit doesn’t work unless it’s pure.

1878 2018-07-06 19:32:06 Cheney wanted to steal Iraq's oil before Bush was even elected.
The war was one of theft and conquest.
The place is riven by conflict. "strength to strength" - when the contractors rebuilding the infrastructure banked the $ and did nothing?
What b.s.
I think I insulted walruses.
1879 2018-07-06 19:32:02 Our Small Batch this week is Et Tu Caprese!

A swirl of three sweet cream ice creams to emulate the flavors of a Caprese Salad! Burrata and Pink Peppercorns, Basil and Olive Oil and Orange scented candied Sun-dried Tomato!
1880 2018-07-06 19:32:01 Chocolate oil cake is in the oven!! 
1881 2018-07-06 19:31:47 Same happening here in Scotland. We've lost several coal plants in recent years with nothing to replace them. Not even a carbon-scrubbed oil plant, despite all the oil Scotland has.
1882 2018-07-06 19:31:39 tbh my best facial feature is my oil . like my face oil hits the perfect spots. people keep complimenting my “glowy” face but i’m really just oily .
1883 2018-07-06 19:31:30 He’s a snake oil salesman and the people who believe in him have been duped. I always remained true to who I was however you were the one who switched. You went from fighting aginas a corrupt govt, to believe in a corrupt man who promised he would fix the corrupt government.
1884 2018-07-06 19:31:22 Lieutenant Matt.
1885 2018-07-06 19:31:14 Again, oil burner will do 50mpg at 70mph, on 1100rpm
1886 2018-07-06 19:31:14 Those denigrating Canadian oil in favour of conflict oil from nations that reject carbon action plans and enviro regs like Canada has should hang their heads in shame. That means you.
1887 2018-07-06 19:31:12 The Miracle moist shampoo and conditioner is a lifesaver and they also do an oil aswell! I would put the oil on before you dry your hair and also after you straighten/curl your hair to give it moisture and gloss! 
1888 2018-07-06 19:31:06 I followed the recipe closely but added sawdust and motor oil. this recipe is terrible. one star
1889 2018-07-06 19:31:05 I chopped my eyebrow off and the end by accident & i can’t tell if genetics or this castor oil helped it grow back faster 
1890 2018-07-06 19:30:32 No more engine oil
1891 2018-07-06 19:30:21 No. And can you name the people that said “communism is good”?? The subsidies that American corporations should be spent on the citizens! If an oil company makes $32 billion ur then why should we subsidize it to the tune of $23bil. That’s unAmerican!!
1892 2018-07-06 19:29:59 The alternative isn’t plausible
1893 2018-07-06 19:29:48 @senatormikelee @MitchMcConnell @SenPatRoberts

1894 2018-07-06 19:29:08 I rotate between vitamin E oil, the Burt’s bees belly rub, and pure coco butter and so far so good!
1895 2018-07-06 19:29:01 US judge throws out climate change lawsuits against big oil
1896 2018-07-06 19:28:55 Oil is in the east and it should stay there ! The east had enough injustice so as the south ,we won't be ruled by Tripoli or Muslimbrotherhood or militias? We fight to the last man ! We are not Tripolitans? We don't bend over as they did woth Italy !
1897 2018-07-06 19:28:49 correct order of skincare products:
- cleanser (with salicylic acid)
- toner (with AHA or/and BHA)
- serum (vitamin c or hyaluronic acid)
- eye cream
- moisturizer (to repair skin barrier)
- face oil (rosehip seed or marula oil)
- spot treatment (tea tree oil or benzoyl peroxide)
1898 2018-07-06 19:28:45 Yumega oil is good too
1899 2018-07-06 19:28:42 It’s just that we disagree with the silly binary posited and don’t trust the snake oil salesmen and their stupid solutions.
1900 2018-07-06 19:28:40 Disgrace? No. I’ll leave that to the Prime Minister. A sellout shill paid by foreign oil interests? Definitely
1901 2018-07-06 19:28:37 Suppose just pissed the league so yeh.  But where would we be without the oil laaar
1902 2018-07-06 19:28:21 Sweet oil works every time.
1903 2018-07-06 19:28:17 Glances at the computer screen. . .
Squirts some oil in the pan.
1904 2018-07-06 19:28:14 We cannot continue to depend on crude oil alone for survival. It is high time we start thinking of how to invest heavily in agriculture. Our land is still fertile, cocoa will fetch us a fortune. Let whoever will govern this country in 2019 take note. @MBuhari @GarShehu @atiku
1905 2018-07-06 19:28:04 I think Olive oil is better
1906 2018-07-06 19:27:56 Ughhhh, seriously need to learn to change my own oil. I hate waiting and I'm paying them so I CAN WAIT ON THEMMM
1907 2018-07-06 19:27:54 Excellent thought provoking decision! We must make a stand against the use of palm oil

1910 2018-07-06 19:27:30 That’s exactly why I got it  that oil is no joke
1911 2018-07-06 19:27:16 What no beard oil?
1912 2018-07-06 19:27:14 Nor paid any of his workers. Trump is nothing more than a snake oil salesman. And people guzzle it down by the barrel.
1913 2018-07-06 19:26:47 He knows our practice area as it's been in use for 12 years or so. I've been letting local pilots know where our box is at so they are vigilant when near it. But the non-locals are the issue and not much I can do besides invest in smoke oil & hope they see me!
1914 2018-07-06 19:26:44 @POTUS time to release some oil reserves before it effects Americans to badly
1915 2018-07-06 19:26:39 Calling it now: Eventually some Federal District Court is gonna throw up its hands and decide Afghanistan is basically the 51st state.
1916 2018-07-06 19:26:18 Wow Veteran in a oil war and fake claims of weapons of mass destruction still pretending the military was fighting for “freedom” in Afghanistan. Just goes to show you in the military they break you down just to build you brain washed
1917 2018-07-06 19:26:16 Screw up for decades then try to fix in two weeks?  Tina sold our oil reserves, the whole ANC are hell bent on getting us to junk status and a sliding rand. Corruption and mismagement at SOEs.  Sorry Abuti, a knee-jerk reaction is not leadership

1920 2018-07-06 19:25:51 He wants their oil. He also just wants to play war games. What could go wrong?
1921 2018-07-06 19:25:44 any make up remover oil is so much better for your skin than make up wipes and it (in my opinion) also makes it easier to actually get it all off
1922 2018-07-06 19:25:31 ONE finger was greasy with cooking oil. guess which finger I used to unlock my phone
1923 2018-07-06 19:25:31 Now you are just trolling to own the libs. The 1953 Iranian coup overthrew of Iran’s elected PM Mosaddegh and installed the tyrannical rule of the Shah. The UK and US orchestrated the coup to protect BP’s oil concessions. Iranian society still suffers from our meddling
1924 2018-07-06 19:25:23 I love the flavors at salt and straw. Weird, Wild and Artsy Fartsy. Super hipster vibes but I mean that in the best way possible. Their olive oil ice cream is  same for that weird goat cheese brittle one
1925 2018-07-06 19:25:19 i’m creasing, tell me why yesterday night i come downstairs to see that my dad ate half a cake to himself, only to realise he was high as shit on weed oil he gotten from someone to help his cancer (trying to self medicate) and his eyes were red as shit, couldn’t sleep either,
1926 2018-07-06 19:25:11 Neither’s great, but I grew up w the former in Houston and get the latter here in Amarillo and prefer the dry heat. It gets down to the 60s by morning even on triple digit heat summer days, and that cool lasts until about 9-10 a.m.
1927 2018-07-06 19:25:03 No the economic blockade has started slowly from 2015, not as violent as it is now. It was triggered by the oil collapse: a good opportunity for the US and right wing countries in Latin America to destroy Venezuela. Venezuelans are like mice in a cage, sadly
1928 2018-07-06 19:25:01 Is that the same Thatcher that signed the single European act in 1986 to set up the SM? The same thatcher that used the oil money to fund the current account deficit rather than build up a sovereign wealth fund like Norway did? Which is now worth just under a trillion euro?

1936 2018-07-06 19:24:05 Increasing oil prices might have had something to do with that growth. That and companies needing to rebuild reserves thru drilling. Main thing though, the economy was so gutted, it could only grow. #NotleyCountdown

1939 2018-07-06 19:23:24 To suggest the gravity of the topic, we may give a Latin title to our next report: “Sicut Talos VII adunationem proprietas vadit, sic est futurum Mexicanus oleum reformare” (“As goes the unitization of Talos 7 property, so goes the future of the Mexican [upstream] oil reform").
1940 2018-07-06 19:23:15 Why don’t oil companies just stop selling New York oil. Problem solved. Then we can see how many hours it takes them to start kicking in screaming for oil.

1944 2018-07-06 19:22:58 How did you get to that conclusion? Were you aware that the $ was going to recover the way it did, or crude oil price was going to be where it is, or Trumps’ policies were going to have this impact, etc...and how to finance free education????
1945 2018-07-06 19:22:51 High key don’t want to go get my oil changed

Happy Friday.
1948 2018-07-06 19:22:15 I don’t care if we EVER legalize marijuana, but for God’s sake, make the non psychoactive CBD Oil legal for anyone and everyone. It could be so helpful in pain control and avoid use of opioids. @glennbeck @JohnStossel
1949 2018-07-06 19:21:51 Looks like "Oil Tot" had a beautiful week because he has a beautiful soul! You really are loved! 
1950 2018-07-06 19:21:44 And they gave the fox a frying pan, some breadcrumbs, and a bottle of olive oil.
1951 2018-07-06 19:21:42 Abusive is exactly the right word, Peter.  This IS abuse.  Contemtable treatment from those who should be protecting him n his health.  Truly shocked by this.  His Mum is more than capable of giving him a few drops of oil every day.  This terrible situation must be resolved asap
1952 2018-07-06 19:21:19 Not me.  @SeamusTheKing is making my fried chicken today.  Cast iron and hot high smoke point oil is what he'd suggest, I think...
1953 2018-07-06 19:21:15 As much as most people seem good with Strome signing for 2 x $3.1 excuse me if im not all that stoked when I see Athanasiou sign for 2 x $3m. A player that would actually move the needle for the Oil on wing.
1954 2018-07-06 19:21:12 Agree on Iran. I see it as Putin, the chess master, ordered Trump to cancel Iran deal to turn EU against US causing intense friction. Iran's compliant knowing it can sell oil to thirsty China which can't be sanctioned like French Total Oil can be. No net loss to Putin+Iran+China
1955 2018-07-06 19:20:36 did you not use any oil

1958 2018-07-06 19:19:45 They were all like hyens together. Bloody shame. None of them wanted to wind it there infact puting more oil in fire. Disgusting to see. Ek akeli aurat aur itni sari not dogs but BITCHES.

1964 2018-07-06 19:18:54 oil producers will fill the gap in the oil market. Iran exports only above 2million barrels a day. Thanks for giving credit to the Saudi foreign policy & influence. Do you also think Japan, South Korea and India’s decisions 2 reduce importing Iranian oil due to Saudi influence?
1965 2018-07-06 19:18:51 Well Canada ships more oil to the US
1966 2018-07-06 19:18:42 We also buy oil from MX. Wonder how that's going to go.

1973 2018-07-06 19:17:43 It's also very funny that the initial reaction to the oil company's proposal to buy up their town isn't "oh no, our traditional way of life" but "hot damn, we're gonna be rich!"
1974 2018-07-06 19:17:23 information from inside Sirte about presence of armed groupings of battalions in Sirte was not yet confirmed, army aware of existence of movements to try to control Crescent oil again,  fortified construction forces of GNA, battalions of Saraya Benghazi,+some who fled from Derna

Absolutely NOT! They strip skin of necessary healing oils. The body reacts by secreting more oil, which can lead to breakouts. They also dry out pores, creating the opposite of a juicy, #hydrated & #healthy glow! #SavorBeauty

2022 2018-07-06 19:11:58 Yes, I know. And not just in India. And not just coal. For example (fracked) oil & gas in the USA. That's my point. Nuclear has to be cheaper than fossil fuel if humanity is to have any hope of getting off fossil fuels.
IMO nuclear professionals are complacent.
A real pity.
2023 2018-07-06 19:11:56 Don't get too excited. We had enough people willing to swallow the snake oil of the (Mercer/Putin funded) Brexit campaign and MPs issuing billows of bullshit and waffle in support of it.

2056 2018-07-06 19:07:54 I don't suppose there's a way I can boycott Oklahoma Oil&Gas and still work for OU and have electricity?
2057 2018-07-06 19:07:51 But you don’t have to be as strict or religious about it, just reducing salt intake, refined and added sugars, and oil with slowly start to affect how you taste food and enjoy it. Meal delivery kits can help too, sometimes. Their recipes can blow sometime.
2058 2018-07-06 19:07:35 Hate when there's too much oil in anything I'm eating.
2059 2018-07-06 19:07:19 Just so we all understand this right. We have a trade war, high oil $, min wage growth, goods pricing increase, tax deduct's removed or capped, student debt in the TT'$S, --shall i go on? And the market is enjoying this. What are we all missing @RayDalio ?
2060 2018-07-06 19:07:04 Karmic debt will come full circle & cash in no matter how much folks will pray for or love someone.

2061 2018-07-06 19:07:01 Well, America had the excellent Baker electric cars at the turn of the (20th) century. Remember, your car does not exist to transport you: it exists to consume the product the oil companies have to sell.
2062 2018-07-06 19:06:59 my car battery started acting up right before my scheduled oil change so I told them when I came in but they don’t have time for that today so now I just have to hope my car will start one more time to drive it in tomorrow

Respected Sir, 
Our company stand on product base. I'm very frustrated from our management which is not maintaining their stocks. Eg. one product i.e. KRILL OIL out of stock from a week from mini& DLCP (Ramesh ngr). Your comment please.
2066 2018-07-06 19:06:36 Great point. Add to that the gas & oil used to wage war to get more gas & oil. There is not reason for anyone in this nation to be homeless or hungry or without medical care except for greed & MIC & a government that's been bought
2067 2018-07-06 19:06:31 knock knock do you have oil
2068 2018-07-06 19:06:28 Then tell America to stay out of their business and let them run their own country. Oh..right... we want their oil
2069 2018-07-06 19:06:24 Amazon is too big for its own good. They are fast becoming the next standard oil company.
2070 2018-07-06 19:06:09 That’s nice especially when consider where he’s from water is more expensive than oil.

2076 2018-07-06 19:05:16 I bought my ex a car for 21st bday. 3 days later she never came home one night. I found the car I poured kitty litter down the throttle body, and into the oil fill. She was with my best friend.

2078 2018-07-06 19:05:00 Preparing noodles with my coconut oil  come to think of it, indomie coconut flavor won’t be a bad idea 
2079 2018-07-06 19:04:51 We have got barbecue food from M&S and it is OFF THE HOOK. Chicken fillets with mango and coconut? Herby falafels with humous layered with chilli oil? Chocolate covered popcorn! 
2080 2018-07-06 19:04:47 Watched a driver in an SUV tailgate an oil truck for about 6 miles on a road that had absolutely no other traffic for miles...except me....why?????
2081 2018-07-06 19:04:45 i bought an oil for this, when i get it ill give you some to try out .
2082 2018-07-06 19:04:32 That’s a really positive thing the zoo has done in removing all @Nestle products. Hope @Nestle see sense and rejoin the RSPO in supporting sustainable palm oil production, in the hope of helping save so many animals and birds from extinction.
2083 2018-07-06 19:04:29 I’ve had my KA mixer for 20 years and it still spins like a top. I don’t use it that often but I will turn it on periodically to make sure the oil stays distributed. I’ve never checked the bowl adjustment, but I will today! Thanks!

2093 2018-07-06 19:02:40 If #Haftar's intention was to trigger any type of #Libya-wide economic reform, it is neither the time (elex planned) nor the way (#oil blockade) to do it.

Acknowledging #Haftar's approach is usually that of a strategist, the only conclusion is this was meant to be a flashpoint.

2095 2018-07-06 19:02:34 Yea oil prices went up and there was a minimum wage hike, so we had to... Haha any excuse in order to gouge us.
2096 2018-07-06 19:02:25 Let's just drop some bombs and take their oil. Show them what some real nukes look like.
2097 2018-07-06 19:02:16 I feel like a grown up doing my first oil change and shit
2098 2018-07-06 19:02:12 Funny i used to actually believe that oil comes from dino fossils
2099 2018-07-06 19:01:51 When was Labour 'decent'? When we were secretly supporting torture, starting illegal wars for oil and flogging weapons to Saudi perhaps? Im glad that Labour is dead. And may its corpse never be exhumed

2102 2018-07-06 19:01:29 ah ok, mine is in similar place but have rose bush climbing up wall  so leaves from that provide a little shade. you'll have to let us know if someone moves in. dad painted mine with some oil to protect the wood
2103 2018-07-06 19:01:28 Because oil was $45 a barrel .
2104 2018-07-06 19:01:24 got some soaking in olive oil for like some months now lol
2105 2018-07-06 19:01:15 What @BenJealous doesn't tell you about his "Medicare for all" idea is that as a federally administered program he would have zero say in expanding it.

This are false hopes being peddled as realities by a snake oil salesman who belongs nowhere near any sort of public office.
2106 2018-07-06 19:01:13 $ANW someone predict end of month price with these oil prices

2109 2018-07-06 19:00:54 Canada would be foolish to leave this in the ground. We can’t stop oil demand globally regardless of what we do on pipelines, but we can lead the world in green energy while taking advantage of the profits and creating an environment that promotes the shift.
2110 2018-07-06 19:00:50 Regular toothbrushes were assumed, so the electric ones are a step up if everything else really isn't working. And there isn't enough research to officially recommend oil pulling.
2111 2018-07-06 19:00:45 China and Russia are mad. Venezuela has been sanctioned as a member of OPEC. The Saudis are using more of their own oil. China and Russia had investments in Iran too as did other non signatories. Oil is a global market. Taking out Iran hurts everyone
2112 2018-07-06 19:00:38 Y’all done got paid, got oil changes, getting cute for GHerbo tonight and y’all don’t know how to act rn AND it’s a nice Friday?!  Be safe if y’all are on the road man lmao

2120 2018-07-06 18:59:59 The left loves to cite Norway as the benchmark for all things good in the world.  Norway has been extracting and selling oil for years to shore up their sovereign wealth fund and pay for services.  They have an electric car mandate coming, yet still sell tons of oil.
2121 2018-07-06 18:59:49 Et dans ces cas là, on ne parle pas de pollution atmosphérique......Gas oil; essences, plastique....chaleur....les feux de la St. jean avec un peu de retard et la destruction par le feu.
2122 2018-07-06 18:59:44 I think he means Blue States subsidizes the economically idiotic Red States. Alaska and Dallas are exceptions bc they have oil. Otherwise, very backward.

2125 2018-07-06 18:58:59 I use CBD oil on my cats.  One has serious asthma and the other is an antisocial spaz.  Noticed a HUGE difference in both of them.  I will pray for your child.  Highly recommend at least trying the CBD oil.
2126 2018-07-06 18:58:56 If the banks do anything positive on their releases we probably see new ATHs on SPX, finally. NQ names never build downside momentum after initial drop, and oil will prevent XLE from dropping.

2128 2018-07-06 18:58:08 Don’t be impressed by “new”. Every car on the road today was new at one point. What sustains them isn’t their outward design but well maintained engine. Worshipers: what’s sustaining you? New songs? Or fresh oil? #worship
2129 2018-07-06 18:58:04 I changed my oil, mowed my grass, did all my laundry and cleaned my whole house... now what

2133 2018-07-06 18:57:40 When the rand was R14 or R15 to the dollar, what was the price of oil?
2134 2018-07-06 18:57:26 Can they return palm oil? 
2135 2018-07-06 18:57:26 Socialization of the oil industry is what is destroying Venezuela, as well as price caps on necessities. Which private industry can you point to that is significantly responsible for the mess there?

2138 2018-07-06 18:57:09 because oil goes through parts account and they cant deal with service departments. Both need to sacrifice margin
2139 2018-07-06 18:57:05 Frying is/was also a cooking method that saved power - in the past fish and chips was a staple for miners' and workers' families because a single pot of oil could cook a whole town's worth of fish dinners for a few pennies worth of coal in a cooker.
2140 2018-07-06 18:56:59 In addition, the veg oil industry was born.  While preparing the soy meal for animals, the oil could be removed and used for myriad purposes.  Part of this was driven by war time needs for oil (which I think came first, before the soy meal protein part).
2141 2018-07-06 18:56:58 Especially capitalism driven by perpetual wars so the defense and oil industries can prosper. We have an “Oil”-garchy.

2152 2018-07-06 18:54:27 For those not following the thread. This is from a report that was superseded and only includes data to 2009 which ignores the jump in oil-by-rail in 2010 onwards. A newer report exists and is the one I rely on.
2153 2018-07-06 18:54:27 Jo Malone French Lime Blossom. Why? Introduced to it as bath oil, beside my brother’s tub in SF. I’d come to see/help him not knowing he would die 2 weeks later. It remains one of the most powerful associations I have of him.
2154 2018-07-06 18:54:23 Your right. Many people say that BC have passed laws when they haven’t. I think we should be building one east instead so other Canadians don’t have to import expensive foreign oil

2173 2018-07-06 18:52:02 Honestly, I love the Palmers Cocoa butter or Palmers cocoa oil formula but if you don’t like drug store stuff use Clinique dramatically different moisturizing cream. It’s the best

2175 2018-07-06 18:51:58 I've seen 3 different people use a jar of melted coconut oil to demonstrate how hot it is, as if the melting point of coconut oil is common knowledge.

2205 2018-07-06 18:49:05 It's the exact opposite. Venezuela had a sustainable public debt under Chavez and public investments led the growth, not oil that represented an important revenue of course. Before the 70s V. was the first oil exporter in the world, and yet poverty was off the charts

Try to do this every 2-3 days while the roads are so hot. And an oil check/top up, too once a week would be good. Now go and rest!

2264 2018-07-06 18:41:51 China is the #1 producer of both solar panels and wind turbines. And China is a mostly coal powered economy. Then, these wares need to be transported all over the world using oil. Finally, they need pairing power plants usually natural gas driven.

2276 2018-07-06 18:40:09 Nah, calling @MaryamNSharif Nihatti larki is not misogynistic. Instead, calling her 45 sala burhiya is ageist bullcrap, as Tazeen puts it.

2286 2018-07-06 18:39:23 The oil decline cycle took about two years to complete. Not a short amount of time. It took place during both a GOP and DNC administration. Presidents have at best very minor influence (via rhetoric) over markets, commodities or the pricing of them.

2360 2018-07-06 18:28:43 What reason do people have to fake global warming? Is renewable energy not a good idea? Do you think ever that you’re being conned by gas and oil lobbyists?
2361 2018-07-06 18:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2362 2018-07-06 18:28:34 How can you be living in 2018 and not understand that we need to transition to clean energy. Rail vs pipeline is a bogus choice. Keep it in the ground. Get out of the pocket of Big Oil.
2363 2018-07-06 18:28:24 I HOPE SO! And like lotion? Just oil. And since I have very sensitive skin I use baby oil.

2367 2018-07-06 18:28:16 Adding coconut oil to the food and brushing regularly with the paws pamper undercoat rake works like magic for my husky- worth a try :)
2368 2018-07-06 18:28:08 wonder how much longer we gone be stealing oil before they tell us that we stealing it
2369 2018-07-06 18:28:07 So the place I usually get my oil changed at has new owners....
2370 2018-07-06 18:27:58 You gotta keep it fun. There’s a show on Netflix where they cook with bud, and I mean they make some shit that sounds amazing using Cana oil, and cana butter.
2371 2018-07-06 18:27:57 People need to stop with these FADs. There is no special drink, pill, tea, fucken plant you eat the roots of or magic oil that you rub on your belly.

2375 2018-07-06 18:27:24 can’t talk about selling neymar without analyzing the volatility of global oil prices and lamenting the market’s downturn

2377 2018-07-06 18:27:06 What prosperity? Tariffs are hurting our agricultural exports, and companies are moving factories overseas to get around manufacturing tariffs. GDP was revised down to 2%, not the "4, 5, even 6%" Trump promised. Oil prices and inflation are rising. DOW's down 2k over past 6mos.
2378 2018-07-06 18:26:57 Because it's a colossal Flim Flam, Snake Oil sale by the GOP'S, to appease their greedy, avarice infested MasterBase. ECON 101 & Adam Smith's Mantra is their Gospel; F*ck everyone else, & look out for #1 FIRST.
2379 2018-07-06 18:26:56 Came here for a oil change they tryna run it up. Noooope, thanks for the extra ish tho lmao
2380 2018-07-06 18:26:44 Yeah it's annoying.. I feel you! You try applying some cold yogurt I'm sure it'll cool down your skin, after that apply some coconut oil. I hope you'll get better, love you tons 
2381 2018-07-06 18:26:41 They forget we buy oil in $ , pound down fuel prices up, less buses

*pops to the toolbox *
2393 2018-07-06 18:24:59 I'M DROWNING IN BABY OIL BUT BELGIUM SCORED. THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO COME BACK TO.
2394 2018-07-06 18:24:48 Sorry, I am unclear what you mean? Heavy crude oil and diluted bitumen share most of their major spill characteristics and the rail lines cross far more fish-bearing streams than the pipelines. Moreover the pipeline is designed to survive over an 8.0 earthquake unlike the rails.
2395 2018-07-06 18:24:23 Do you get your “news” only from Fox? Hannity? Bannon? Brietbart? Infowars?

Cause you’re buying what they’re selling. Snake oil.
2396 2018-07-06 18:24:00 Not as much as you without the glasses.
2397 2018-07-06 18:23:50 Witsel is an average player #facts
2398 2018-07-06 18:23:38 I took my car in for an oil change and the guy helping complimented my shoes and he made my day.
2399 2018-07-06 18:23:24 Say it isn’t so @potus. Hire Americans. . Snake oil salesman through and through
2400 2018-07-06 18:23:06 She needs to hire me to be her oil boy
2401 2018-07-06 18:22:40 Trumpsters - he’s lying. Again.  Decision not based on merits. Was dismissed WITHOUT prejudice meaning it can be filed again.  The DNC isn’t a party.  The court specifically says that it isn’t addressing the merits.   Wake the f up.  He’s a snake oil salesman.
2402 2018-07-06 18:22:26 Chillies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, rice vinegar, fish sauce and sesame oil. Will be adding to a mixed green salad with roast cashews and mushrooms. #c4news
2403 2018-07-06 18:22:24 You keep proving me right. The LOOP issue has been de-bunked, the sulfer (shipping oil) will actually benefit Suncor in the oil sands. Your China info is incorrect - we shipped 600 000 barrels in 2017. You know I work closely in this industry right?
2404 2018-07-06 18:22:23 He’s a thief and a grifter who set to work destroying the environment so his oil buddies could get another 1/2% growth

2408 2018-07-06 18:21:27 We need a Twitter-wide book club to promote a reading culture among all of us.. cause the level of ignorance, specially bout the oil price and land, has been appalling 
2409 2018-07-06 18:21:20 bitches want a baby so bad and when they get one they don’t know how to use it, like “what oil does it take regular or diesel”
2410 2018-07-06 18:21:17 I'm going to be a lot more careful the next time I use chili oil while cooking… Now, how do I stop breathing fire? 
2411 2018-07-06 18:21:16 Oil Prices slipped below $77 a barrel under pressure from higher Saudi production and trade tensions between the United States and China, despite support from oil supply disruptions
2412 2018-07-06 18:21:11 Unless you have a lot of $ to spend, you'll need a fossil-fuel furnace (oil/propane). I recommend adding a heat pump that will suffice until the temps get very cold. The cost of electricity to operate it is less than the cost of fossil fuel.
2413 2018-07-06 18:21:07 Of course will be replaced by someone who doesn't have a clue for the environment but has money in the game of oil/natural gas/coal
2414 2018-07-06 18:20:55 The government has seized plenty of the means of production there, most notably oil assets which are core of the economy there.
2415 2018-07-06 18:20:49 My cars oil, gas, and low tire pressure lights are on. And honestly same.
2416 2018-07-06 18:20:47 Sound like someone dont like their false news being confronted!
2417 2018-07-06 18:20:44 Don't agree that's the reason. Its just an American thingy, 

The war on oil and gas is a stable crop in the political schemes. Mueller or no Mueller aluta continua
2418 2018-07-06 18:20:38 Detox him before you ask for Information... Cannibus Oil
2419 2018-07-06 18:20:33 Lmfao jokes on you Nigga I been running everyday but you still looking like a oil slick 
2420 2018-07-06 18:20:10 There’s a slim chance I fall, Olive oil

2423 2018-07-06 18:20:02 the smell okay tk? Ke busuk? cs i use tea tree oil Aiken busuk :(
2424 2018-07-06 18:19:56 The reason for my poll. Speaking to a close relative who said:
1. Scotland shouldn’t be Independent because we “all” need to stick together (doesn’t get irony)
2. The SNHS is “rubbish”
3. We don’t have any oil or any money.
4. The SNP is going to tax us to the hilt.
2425 2018-07-06 18:19:41 So tonight, small whole potatoes (don't ask me what kind that requires getting up to look) onion, mushrooms, olive oil, spices, in the oven. Aka my first non frozen meal in quite some time. Yay for sales.

2427 2018-07-06 18:19:05 Either you don't understand what you're talking about or you simply like to lie. In 2014 the Venezuelan oil price was reduced by HALF!!!! Do you understand that 95% of exports are based on oil, so Venezuela lost 50% of its export only in 2014
2428 2018-07-06 18:19:02 Its not that they think, but you have.

2430 2018-07-06 18:18:58 Careful Ted.  Minnesota sports teams and high expectations go together like oil and water.
2431 2018-07-06 18:18:54 thank you dude,, i appreciate it a lot
2432 2018-07-06 18:18:47 But even given the numbers they provide it still doesn't prove that the meat industry is worse than the oil industry, Even though they claim it does.
2433 2018-07-06 18:18:41 Oh look...bike panties
2434 2018-07-06 18:18:29 It's science. Oil and other debris accumulates on roads and it mixes with water when it rains. First rain in awhile means lots of oil to mix. So they were probably more slippery than usual.
2435 2018-07-06 18:18:28 It's prob the salty Italian oil 
2436 2018-07-06 18:18:03 There is no way for me to know that. Look for oil leaks into the compressor housing. That's often an indication that the bushing or support for the shaft is worn out.
2437 2018-07-06 18:18:01 Uh Ghandi, we got a little oil spill situation we dealing with right now
2438 2018-07-06 18:17:59 No...he's a #politicalopportunist! Every time I hear him talk I feel like I have been rubbed down in snake oil!
2439 2018-07-06 18:17:50 McDonald’s milkshakes is so oil 
2440 2018-07-06 18:17:48 a wristwatch fuelled by coconut oil
2441 2018-07-06 18:17:48 I'm sure it was a great interview, but will have to take your word for it. Won't listen to anything sponsored by Neurohacker or similar purveyors of snake oil.
2442 2018-07-06 18:17:48 Bio oil is good
2443 2018-07-06 18:17:47 Wow, hope this "brave" GOP clown remembered to say, "pretty please don't hack our election again". I bet the GOP traitors then did a wink wink,  & collected their rubles & percentage of their oil deal money & rec'd their new Kremlin orders.
2444 2018-07-06 18:17:40 How come nobody ever told me coconut oil was magical?
2445 2018-07-06 18:17:31 Venezuela had reserves and had very sustainable public debt, but the oil price collapse and the isolation from international baking system made it impossible to support production and exports
2446 2018-07-06 18:17:23 CBD oil tentures would be effective in helping with the seizures new studies have found. Good luck!
2447 2018-07-06 18:17:17 Naked and leather couch ? Umm 
Baby oil lots of it 
2448 2018-07-06 18:17:15 Norway supports is people from oil! Just like Venezuela supposedly does! Sweden and Denmark are pulling back because it isn't working well!!!! And the USA military keeps them all safe! Thanks GI's!
2449 2018-07-06 18:17:09 Those turtles will be swimming in oil soon thanks to you.
2450 2018-07-06 18:17:09 I keep trying to tell you, you're not a smart man. What would you call VA benefits, oil & farm subsidies, social security, medicare, medicaid, public schools? 1/2
2451 2018-07-06 18:17:06 u said it earlier because allah has given us oil and resources and this is the reason u hate Saudi Arabia u r just envying us for that and u wish could have it but we will fight for our country and people and would never bow to any one until the last drop of our blood

2454 2018-07-06 18:16:49 What would be seen as a more politically consequential success, refugees moving back into Syria and infrastructure rebuilding or 10 bucks lower oil?
2455 2018-07-06 18:16:43 And there better be some oil or other liquid in there besides baby piss
2456 2018-07-06 18:16:31 Gaga Over Putin, Greedy Oil Pigs, Gentle On Pedophiles, Greed Over People, there are so many possibilities...
2457 2018-07-06 18:16:25 Usually youadd the olive oil on top of whatever you're making. Like when you eat pasta, and then drizzle a bunch of olive oil and cheese right before you eat. same goes for salads, etc. You can also cook veggies with olive oil, but do it on low heat to avoid the smoking point.

2459 2018-07-06 18:16:15 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2460 2018-07-06 18:16:14 Try using some products from lush and argan oil. And get your haircut regularly helps. And try not to use heat on it  yeah I could imagine you wouldn’t be allowed :(
2461 2018-07-06 18:16:12 People: “omg your baby smells so good! What oil is that?”

Me: *Panicked, remembering she threw up 3 times on herself and not sure if I even put an oil on her to mask the smell*

Also me: “...Oh, probably just lavender or something.”
2462 2018-07-06 18:16:10 Comical. The new person will be worse. Likely an uncontrolled oil leak with a mustache.
2463 2018-07-06 18:15:59 Oh yeah you can buy pure cbd oil at health stores now lol
2464 2018-07-06 18:15:56 False, again. You basically lie systematically. Oil price in 2017 was around 40$.
2465 2018-07-06 18:15:54 Uber, but for oil heaters.

2468 2018-07-06 18:15:39 Going to Einstein's for an oil change is one of my favorite things to do. #justordinaryshit
2469 2018-07-06 18:15:22 Damn first you become a huge oil baron and now you're a nationalist!!
2470 2018-07-06 18:15:05 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
2471 2018-07-06 18:14:57 You keep mixing numbers creatively. Oil price dropped of more than 50% in 2014 and another 50% in 2015. Of course the impact on Venezuelan exports and GDP was massive
2472 2018-07-06 18:14:54 A coal lobbyist is like a large lobbyist for the whale oil lighting industry-19th century technology where the jobs are gone and they aren’t ever coming back
2473 2018-07-06 18:14:51 We STILL deserve someone better than Pruitt's immediate replacement. An attorney who worked for big oil and coal... he may not have the same lack of ethics, but he will still not be representing the environment or the American people's needs.

2475 2018-07-06 18:14:47 Tea tree oil on cold sores works amazing as well.
2476 2018-07-06 18:14:45 I can't keep up with all the batshitery - shush, my brain in receiving oil from the Tesla coil in my spine.
2477 2018-07-06 18:14:45 I prefer to rub the clove on crusty toast, rub a tomato on toast, sprinkle with salt and olive oil.  Makes an excellent lunch or starter.  Spanish treat.
2478 2018-07-06 18:14:32 oil can definitely be involved, and don’t you worry, i’m a very skilled mechanic
2479 2018-07-06 18:14:25 How does oil keep every color in murk, water in semblance, and snow in light, when flame makes everything shifting and shady to the eyes?
2480 2018-07-06 18:14:15 Olive Oil ain't gon' be able to sting a gemini like your one night stand will.

2483 2018-07-06 18:13:51 This is beneath even you, if possible.  You just might remember for a moment that you are a president and not a snake oil salesman....but maybe to you they are one in the same.
2484 2018-07-06 18:13:46 @realDonaldTrump You’re an Lying snake oil salesman, he did an awful job that’s why he’s no longer there...
2485 2018-07-06 18:13:40 as long as there is oil involved the rust is pretty bad i may be irreparable
2486 2018-07-06 18:13:28 I hate when I forget to use beard butter/oil 
2487 2018-07-06 18:13:20 I got one more sickening attribute to it, everyday flooding the timeline showing off how they are awarded with this special fucking limited oil that costs my monthly car payment for that stupid 5ml cos ya know I reached my sales wow I'm so blessed yada yada shit
2488 2018-07-06 18:13:15 That little skunk Ryan Zinke has not been in the news lately. Meanwhile he most likely has been selling off as much public land as he can to the oil, gas and coal vultures.

2495 2018-07-06 18:12:32 You want to ignore what does not fit your narrative: in 2014 oil price collapses, basically killing a good 10% or more in GDP. The US start sanctioning and sabotaging Venezuelan economy in 2015, the currency manipulation was triggered by oil price collapse
2496 2018-07-06 18:12:23 Nope. I wish! It’s super expensive, plus I heard it’s kinda sticky. The Sol de Janeiro is a dry oil so it’s not supposed to be sticky.

2507 2018-07-06 18:11:08 These people don’t worry about being employed in #Canada or the entire country that survives from the Oil and gas industry. I good economy runs from these companies. Put things into perspective! Canada is Oil, gas, agriculture and mining. If you don’t like it LEAVE!

2515 2018-07-06 18:10:11 @elonmusk I heard a report that said the 13 largest ships, produce more carbon pollution, than all the cars, on the planet. Most if not all are oil tankers. I invite you to figure out another way to power those ships! Interested?

In relative prosperity? However another Socialist leader/govt has destroyed their country and people are starving or fleeing?
Socialists never learn or admit
"Socialism doesn't work"
2522 2018-07-06 18:09:29 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America

2541 2018-07-06 18:07:16 Seriously? Individuals don't determine the price of oil

2546 2018-07-06 18:06:51 Intellectually lazy we don’t read stories about the environment and how companies like nestle have no moral conscience.

2566 2018-07-06 18:04:28 So now you're against hydro, nuclear, coal and oil...

Plus you make up these claims about Wood Buffalo...

Greenpeace is the Brig. General Jack Ripper of our day, wishing deep misfortune for many on the planet, but they don't have the honesty to admit their central goal.
2567 2018-07-06 18:04:18 If oil prices are up, its good for oil producers in the US (and Brazil) because it is more expensive to pull out of the earth here. If oil prices are down...its not so good. So if soy prices are up, how is it bad for farmers?

2575 2018-07-06 18:02:40 Chipotle’s rice bran oil (I think that was the source, but who knows what else is in there) gave me GI issues for 2 days, & theyre touted as one of the “good chains”. I dont think there are any good chain restaurants, they all go through a “Shark Tank” cheapening filter now.

2635 2018-07-06 17:56:28 The BP oil rig explosion and subsequent oil spill was definitely not an accident.  That wasn't the fault of the US Government.  It was solely due to the negligence of BP Oil and its contractor executives.
2636 2018-07-06 17:56:18 Well you’re going to find out after some cbd oil 
2637 2018-07-06 17:56:06 I don't use the leave in often. I run my hair through the shower every morning, shake dry, then coconut oil and my shae butter whip. All this happens with my hair in twists, which I undo and detangle weekly.
2638 2018-07-06 17:55:57 I just had fryer oil explode on my face. WHAT A GREAT FUCKING START TO MY DAY 
2639 2018-07-06 17:55:50 Citronella, peppermint, eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, & geranium are all essential oils that help repel mosquitoes. Use melaleuca oil to put on any insect bites to help them heal faster & not itch 
2640 2018-07-06 17:55:46 Y’all really need to try corn dogs but instead of ketchup,  you put mf Hellmanns mayo with olive oil on it. 
2641 2018-07-06 17:55:43 From what I could see the oil price dropping to record lows were the problem. Venezuela got caught with the hand in the cookie jar.
2642 2018-07-06 17:55:43 About to make palm oil jollof rice.. been craving that for a min now.
2643 2018-07-06 17:55:43 I understand everyone has a job to do but I’m here for an oil change nothing else so stop trying to add extra sh*t on. The answer will always be NO!
2644 2018-07-06 17:55:30 Eyɛ asɛm oil. Hmmm. "Hello, is this GJA office? You've been so laid back on the attack on the Multimedia reporter. Keep sleeping. But we punish ourselves for wronging you. Read the full report on social media, byebye wai. Over and out" Ajenkoti. Hahahaaa
2645 2018-07-06 17:55:22 Time for Oil change. #oilchange #maintence – bij Long Hyundai
2646 2018-07-06 17:55:14 Cheese is a decent source of protein and contains a good amount of calcium, while Cooking oil's calories come almost entirely from fat.

Not doing Keto, so for me it makes more sense to go for the one that's nutritionally dense. Again, personal choices.
2647 2018-07-06 17:55:14 Context does matter. 
Given that current descendants from another country are being labeled as "aliens" and an "infestation" and corporations are using the US Gov't to put leaking pipelines on their land and drilling for oil on sacred lands, quoting the Declaration is not enough.
2648 2018-07-06 17:55:08 Use Cannabis oil. Find it wherever you can. It's the miracle plant
2649 2018-07-06 17:55:07 tHey SHouLd bE iN ThE W1lD, yeah b but don't k ow if you've noticed how much of the "wild" is being destroyed to provide shit like palm oil that you use on a daily basis
2650 2018-07-06 17:55:00 Lol make hot oil go splash for my nipple 
2651 2018-07-06 17:54:55 エレシスを見守って、眠りにつこう・・・ｚｚZ
2652 2018-07-06 17:54:33 @Nestle it really is about  one that you started to be held accountable for the lack of moral conscience you have as a company. It is time that you supported sustainable palm oil instead of continually thinking of your bottom line @chesterzoo no longer stock your products 1/2
2653 2018-07-06 17:54:23 Best healthcare: Premiums going up!
WALL: It's a fence!
Trade wars: Countries won't back down!
Oil: Prices rising!
Tired of "WINNING"?
2654 2018-07-06 17:54:22 Oil change $60 but what you need is gonna be $180 sir. #hoed
2655 2018-07-06 17:54:08 So explain to me. We don't have oil and we don't have these difficulties economically?
2656 2018-07-06 17:54:07 Because the dumb fuck has destroyed any alliance you have with my country we may shut off the 40 percent of the oil you use and the electricity that powers your state we supply almost half want to live with bower or fuel

2658 2018-07-06 17:53:54 Uranium found its way out of the us?  Source?  
And,again, you completely miss the point of the article if you think it’s about Russians getting oil out of the US or blaming Trump for a company’s debt.
2659 2018-07-06 17:53:48 Si en eso estamos de acuerdo mi precio para el oil es de 110. China está comprando mucho oil a usa (incremento el pedido para disminuir el déficit de usa) pero si se desata guerra comercial le van a sobrar los stocks en usa.
2660 2018-07-06 17:53:35 Boat
2661 2018-07-06 17:53:35 ご連絡ありがとうございます今回の件ですが世間一般で言うところの「ふきんしん」に値するため、お見送りの形をとらせて頂きたいと思います。誠にごめん
2662 2018-07-06 17:53:31 If Iran blocks oil shipments to World, US will suffer little. US is almost self sufficient in oil. China, Iran's friend, will likely suffer much more. Other victims will be JP& SK, and that's not good.
2663 2018-07-06 17:53:20 For data WTO has a data it doesn't show tariff rate but does show% import duty free and virtually anything they make is 0% tariff free. 
Canada owns all oil and other natural resources in that country of which has been imported tariff free kinda balances out.
2664 2018-07-06 17:53:16 I don’t have time for unannounced guests, listen I don’t wear clothes unless I’m cooking so oil don’t pop on my titties
2665 2018-07-06 17:53:14 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
2666 2018-07-06 17:53:10 worse yet lack of any meaningful narrative leaves one susceptible to buying whatever worldview the next snake oil salesman is selling
2667 2018-07-06 17:53:08 Please whenever I say my name is OLIVE don't say asin OLIVE OIL that isn't funny... I find it very stale and annoying.. Thank you
2668 2018-07-06 17:53:02 They're kissing the frogs to safeguard their positions at the expense of our own oil w/c is an irredeemable act of betrayal and treachery. Letting the enemy we're still technically at war with to decide & own the fate of our oil is selling off our country at best. #SouthSudan
2669 2018-07-06 17:53:00 lots of cactus, made into chips, smoothies, juices, paper, somewhat gross massage oil that might still be on my back, and other things
2670 2018-07-06 17:52:42 I wasn't talking about oil. I was talking about the rivers Obama turned orange.
2671 2018-07-06 17:52:38 Really? So the biggest and oldest nail company in the U.S. goes out of business, soy bean prices drop like a rock and Americans pay more for cars, gasoline, heating oil just to mention a few, all to save the steel industry in Ohio? Seriously?
2672 2018-07-06 17:52:35 I use loreal’s color protectant shampoo, some moroccan oil, and then there’s this loreal professional protein treatment that I use once a week and you can get it online at Walmart because it’s a better deal. I’m not sure what it’s called but it’s round and in a yellow container
2673 2018-07-06 17:52:31 land oil and corruption
2674 2018-07-06 17:52:17 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
2675 2018-07-06 17:51:59 THEM BLOODY OIL CULTS ARE FUCKING ANNOYING AF I WAS HAPPY AND MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS TEASING MY SIS ABT HOW I'M ALL HER NOW USING HOME CANDLES AND THAT BITCH STARTS TO BOMBARD MY POST LIKE UGH MENTALLY SLAPPING HER
2676 2018-07-06 17:51:35 Nothing "pushed" people to vote for Trump. Plenty of voters were willing to swallow his snake oil, they would have voted for him no matter what, and they still excuse his obvious lies and failings.
2677 2018-07-06 17:51:17 Frankly, I think "Big Oil Toady" is way too kind. He is much worse than that.
2678 2018-07-06 17:51:07 That’s when the USD was managed to be as good as gold for oil.  Post-04, not so much.  Didn’t matter then bc no one else had the power to do anything about it.  They do now, and they’re doing it
2679 2018-07-06 17:51:07 why'd I let a man who smelled like motor oil 85% of the time ruin my life?
2680 2018-07-06 17:51:04 Coconut oil vitemin e oil foolie 
2681 2018-07-06 17:50:59 Come work in the oil field 
2682 2018-07-06 17:50:59 Baking olive oil zucchini bread tonight. Probably one of my favourite homemade cakes.
2683 2018-07-06 17:50:57 July 6 1988 – The Piper Alpha drilling platform in the North Sea is destroyed by explosions and fires 167 oil workers are killed
2684 2018-07-06 17:50:51 @JustinTrudeau Look, get China and CETA groups together and get the trade flowing around USA. Then finish the pipeline to west coast. Then we can redirect the million plus barrels per day of oil from USA. Maybe also get market rate for our oil as well.

2686 2018-07-06 17:50:38 if you're a high school teacher at Edgewood, come get your oil changed at Meniecke and have an awkward encounter with me. so far there has been two.
2687 2018-07-06 17:50:25 Of the 32 million people in Saudi Arabia an astonishing 62% are under the age of 25 & learning there is no replacement for displacement. This along with other problems in Saudi oil production (over 80% of oil comes from 5 ancient fields) leaves less oil for export #DrivelikeAGirl
2688 2018-07-06 17:50:24 Your world soccer comparison chart
MLS = double A baseball
English premier league = SEC Football
Juventus = Yankees
PSG if the warriors were owned by oil shieks
Bayern Munich = Patriots
Real Madrid/ Barca your sons franchise in NBA 2k18 
Philadelphia Union = soul 2nd string
2689 2018-07-06 17:50:19 The funny thing is that you don't, off the top of your head, know whether Tom Swift and His Great Oil Gusher is an actual 1924 book or a shockingly filthy piece of slash fiction.
2690 2018-07-06 17:50:14 My niece and nephew (from Alberta) call canola fields “oil fields”
2691 2018-07-06 17:50:10 The NWO conspiracy theory is put forward by the church, to take down any organized global leadership during peak oil to maintain the churches power.
2692 2018-07-06 17:49:59 He’s a texture person, but only with his hands. He doesn’t like lotion, beard oil, or chalk either lol
2693 2018-07-06 17:49:43 You can't compare Dubai and Zim never ever. Oil money and cotton money can never be compared. If we had Oil @nelsonchamisa could have met Donald Trump for real.
2694 2018-07-06 17:49:40 nothing more frustrating then tanning and then breaking out from all the tanning oil that’s put on your face 
2695 2018-07-06 17:49:35 “If data is the new oil, what is the new climate change?”

My favorite quote from the #GIForum2018 #AGIT30 panel on location privacy, by @supermaschine.
2696 2018-07-06 17:49:34 I just pulled into oil stop in Petaluma and I ad to admit to the guy that I had no idea how to pop my hood...
2697 2018-07-06 17:49:23 You can literally find anything on YouTube. A good workout, how to cook, how to change your car oil, how to cut your own hair, how to play the cello, how to save money. Thank God for these helpful people.
2698 2018-07-06 17:49:22 And can I reuse the oil to fry?
2699 2018-07-06 17:49:20 @Valvoline Hey ! What could be the negative effects in using conventional oil and not changin it until 6500 miles. I was wondering due to someone putting conventional in my vehicle when synthetic was supposed to be in it!

2701 2018-07-06 17:49:05 Lol so a main point of yours is that oil spills occurred so any regulation/protection of environment is a bad thing. I don't care about your challenge bc you went into this already having made your mind up. I can read/understand the data for myself. It's a shame you refuse to.
2702 2018-07-06 17:48:57 todo lo que está pasando son drivers positivos para el oil. Este año llegará a los 80 dolares el barril y 2019 seguro a los 100
2703 2018-07-06 17:48:50 It's like a Who's Who of Hollywood caricatures ...

The Oil Executive Who Would Be King
The Femme Fatale
The Mafia Enforcer
The Evil Agency Head
The Lying Little Toadie

Trump doesn't fill positions, he casts parts in The Reality President Show.

2704 2018-07-06 17:48:45 These bastards can’t talk and change oil at the same time??
2705 2018-07-06 17:48:37 Money managers increased bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 4,170 net-long positions to 457,388, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show.

2706 2018-07-06 17:48:34 The major style difference between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump is Ronald Reagan was a Salesman for the Best hopes and aspirations of what we could be I do not always agree with him but I knew he believed it. Trump is a sideshow Barker and snake oil salesman at best
2707 2018-07-06 17:48:28 Right because the uranium ain't supposed to leave the US. Newsflash! It's already found it's way out. The article you showed me said even less about the Russians getting oil out of America. Which they would not btw. You need to work on your reading comprehension. You blamed Trump
2708 2018-07-06 17:48:14 親から「死ぬな。生きろ」ってメールが来たんやがもうちょっと具体的なアドバイスなかったんか？
2709 2018-07-06 17:48:10 Came to get my oil changed and I’m sitting in a very tiny room with a tv playing Ancient Aliens and two dude bros who don’t know each other and are standing around instead of sitting in the chairs in said tiny room. Well this is uncomfortable.
2710 2018-07-06 17:48:06 So I posted on fb talking about the candles & this annoying person one of those I know from animal rescue but we're not chummy close or anything & has gotten into the essential oil business lately, started to spam on my status, ON HER OILS. BITCH I CLEARLY WAS TALKING ABT MY OWN
2711 2018-07-06 17:48:04 Do y’all put coconut oil on y’all face??
2712 2018-07-06 17:47:50 Clearly you are from the east. Drain is the best player in that deal. No way the Oil make that deal

2714 2018-07-06 17:47:42 u have to put oil paint directly on the screen its the only way digital will have that traditional feel :/

2716 2018-07-06 17:47:39 Yes! We give our boy Hemp-Works CBD oil for his autism. Its a game changer!
2717 2018-07-06 17:47:37 Oil change $40, differential $50, radiator flush $70. #FirebirdGoVroom PRICELESS 
2718 2018-07-06 17:47:37 @scratchingpost  digging the beard.  How long did it take to get that length?  Do you use balm or oil?  Trim yourself?
2719 2018-07-06 17:47:24 if you had a french lé arteest come to a @PReedGolf golf round, he could do a fantastic oil on canvas that usually takes one hour....just one swing
2720 2018-07-06 17:47:23 Prayers for your son! 
Have you tried CBD OIL for your son's seizures? It's helping a lot of people manage their seizures!
2721 2018-07-06 17:47:23 The difference between the olive oil and the cheese is where those calories come from.  This is why I pay more attention to calories, not to count them, but to determine where they come from.
2722 2018-07-06 17:47:18 We get our oil money back !!!
If the price goes up do we get more ???? Do we fuck ! There is no correlation between the oil money and the money we receive via Barnet - simple even for a Unionist
2723 2018-07-06 17:47:17 Oil bar seketul lima ploh hengget
2724 2018-07-06 17:47:16 like we spent loads on Ozil, Mustafi, Xhaka, Auba, Laca. They'll all contribute. We can't have a whole squad worth 40m+ players. It's not sustainable at a club like Arsenal without oil/russian money
2725 2018-07-06 17:47:11 I have clear skin, but when I was on birth control I had hormonal acne. I started using rose based products then. Andalou naturals 1000 roses line + I make a serum/moisturizer with rose hip oil
2726 2018-07-06 17:47:05 Even funded by, the 2nd largest oil reserves on the planet they went broke!  Maybe Hollywood should make a movie! Maybe get a few of our politicians to put in a cameo!
2727 2018-07-06 17:46:59 He is the epitome of an evil narcissist. I’m still stunned that people buy his snake oil. They all can’t be naive or rage addicts.
2728 2018-07-06 17:46:54 Heck they have enough oil money to buy fans.
2729 2018-07-06 17:46:51 guna ptik kapas letak olive oil
2730 2018-07-06 17:46:48 Pero al precio del oil como va a reaccionar
2731 2018-07-06 17:46:41 Oh god, I can't explain why but now I have Midnight Oil stuck in my head. HOW CAN WE TWEET WHILE OUR BEDS ARE BURNING 
2732 2018-07-06 17:46:20 never had such a bad outbreak. at work we get aphids on our orchids a lot. if I catch it early the soap water works. but when it gets as bad as yours I use neem oil. most of the time u have to mix it but I found a ready to use spray. I'll take a pic of the bottle when I get home
2733 2018-07-06 17:46:00 wow...that is really cool to watch.
2734 2018-07-06 17:45:52 I’m only spending on my car inspection and oil change this week. I can dooo it lol
2735 2018-07-06 17:45:45 That oil money man they tryna buy that CL
2736 2018-07-06 17:45:37 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2737 2018-07-06 17:45:30 Not to mention oil prices doubled since he took office. Higher gas prices also a tax on Americans designed to help Putin, his master
2738 2018-07-06 17:45:19 Yes. Good and bad. If produced in a nuetral environment. Our Internet of Things is created in a Debt Slave environment. Ruling Elite are wickedly selfish and control 80% of all capital on Earth currently. All it takes is a few mnths Oil at $150/brl to tank dollar and take 100%.
2739 2018-07-06 17:45:06 Here is some oil, so you could derust a little bit.
2740 2018-07-06 17:45:00 ma bro why? somtyms you dey bath dirty oil anaa eiish

I’m just mad they don’t come in bigger sizes 
2743 2018-07-06 17:44:47 Trump sees Venezuela as an opportunity to correct what he sees was biggest mistake of Iraq war.  Seize the oil!
2744 2018-07-06 17:44:17 Sesame oil
2745 2018-07-06 17:44:16 What did you have to give up to get this far? Oil at half price? Free water to Iraq? 50 Years contract given to western oil companies?
2746 2018-07-06 17:44:11 Oxy 10 mayan sih bikin kering gt trs lg coba face oil purivera
2747 2018-07-06 17:44:02 CBD oil for breakfast
2748 2018-07-06 17:43:56 I was one of those in the 1970's - we actually pumped the gas, and while that was going on, cleaned the windshields, checked tire pressure, oil, transmission fluid, air filter, etc. Got yelled at a lot when gas went over $1 for the first time. Good times. LOL!
2749 2018-07-06 17:43:27 It’s the same, here in Venezuela. People living under bridges, scavenging garbage daily to eat. The same,as we’re also over the world’s largest oil reserves. The same, as we suffer a corrupt and cleptocratic dictatorship.
2750 2018-07-06 17:43:19 Or oil maybe
2751 2018-07-06 17:43:13 Y lo que puede complicar es el tema comercial entre usa y China al oil
2752 2018-07-06 17:43:02 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
2753 2018-07-06 17:42:56 so you all kill each others by tens of millions for the benefit of the white who wanted your oil and your land

suddan is better than western for agriculture
beware of WHO vaccine or nobody will left alive
2754 2018-07-06 17:42:55 My Mum just likes to invent chores for herself. She went out to get smoked fish and came home with a bag of palm nuts. Suddenly she wants to make palm oil from scratch  Beht why?
2755 2018-07-06 17:42:44 There was a wasp in my kitchen so I did the only necessary thing: Sprayed him with 0 Calorie-0 Trans Fat-Canola Oil and ground him up in the garbage disposal
2756 2018-07-06 17:42:34 SO THATS STEAMED SALMON SEASONED WITH THYME . SCOTCH BONNIE PEPPERS . GINGER . OLIVE OIL AND SESAME OIL (OBVS FISH SEASONING TOO) WITH STEAMED VEGETABLES IN OLIVE OIL, LIME AND SALT + PEPPER . AND SPAGHETTI .
2757 2018-07-06 17:42:30 Boycott Esso (Imperial Oil ) American oil company.

2759 2018-07-06 17:42:16 If you can’t change your own brakes let alone oil on your car then move along you’re not qualified to comment on automotive companies.  #dipshits
2760 2018-07-06 17:42:11 If those people hadn’t blown our oil money on Danny’s Muskrat, we would have a new HMP and a new Waterford by now for sure. Shameful mismanagement of OUR money.

2762 2018-07-06 17:42:05 Then why did Trump hire the worst swamp rats there are?   Putting oil and gas executives in charge of the EPA is the most swamp thing I can think of.   I would happily vote for a republican if they were pro-science and made decisions based on analytical data.
2763 2018-07-06 17:41:56 I feel like such a grownup. My car needs an oil change so I’m actually having it done instead of running out of town to start my camping weekend right away.
2764 2018-07-06 17:41:50 First Impression: If you squint a little, you'll also see 'OLIVE' in the mix, and it's an easy progression to 'I LOVE OLIVE OIL', so let's break out the ingredients for a fresh salad, I'll bring the croutons.
2765 2018-07-06 17:41:32 I got a foot rub w. lavender oil *drooling*
2766 2018-07-06 17:41:32 Sauté onion, garlic, ginger in oil with cinnamon stick, green chili & kadi patta. Add pre-marinated chicken & beaten yogurt. Once the oil begins to leave the sides & the chicken appears cooked add coconut milk simmer and it’s ready to be eaten with parantha or steamed rice.
2767 2018-07-06 17:41:27 The only way to truly save this planet is to bioengineer small monsters that do shit like breath fire & generate electricity but can be trained like pets & kept in small ball-like structures so that we can eliminate oil use & run entire cities on Pika-Power & Slugma-Slime alone

2769 2018-07-06 17:41:10 You infuse a little olive oil with hash add when you make your brine it will separate but you just shake it up when you take it out of the fridge and it’s all 
2770 2018-07-06 17:41:10 I really don’t want to have to get an oil change. I’m poor.

2774 2018-07-06 17:40:29 Just used a new salt scrub in the shower with so much oil in it, it literally made me waterproof. Water just beaded up and rolled off my skin 
2775 2018-07-06 17:40:18 I'm relatively anxiety-free but MAN any stranger, even an oil change mechanic driving my car freaks me out.
2776 2018-07-06 17:40:17 The money Scotland gets is NOT dependant on oil any more than it is on Jam production in Kent - that was the point from the very first tweet. I understand economics very well.
2777 2018-07-06 17:40:12 Drill...
If we can drill deep water wells and oil wells in 2-5 days then surely it can be done to get underground flooding released...

2796 2018-07-06 17:38:13 A tablespoon of olive oil is 120 calories! I can add a quarter cup of cheese to whatever I'm cooking for less than that

Cooking in actual oil provides a lot of flavor though. It really comes down to how you want to spend your Kilocalorie Funbucks

2813 2018-07-06 17:36:38 You made it about Trump cause you said he is taking away rights. And protected the free flow of oil is protecting Americans and other countries. If control of oil gets in the wrong hands, we all lose. Not that difficult to understand.

2816 2018-07-06 17:36:27 To me, I see each one of these potential systems to be a "practice drill" for everyone. and it looks like we might get hit with a few more before people start to take Hurricanes & the weather more seriously than the idea that the EPA ever won battles against the oil industry.
2817 2018-07-06 17:36:22 tremendous progress in destroying our environment and leaving nothing for future generations, all because you lack the spine to stand up to old crooks in the oil industry

2823 2018-07-06 17:35:31 Pruitt handing out waivers to oil refiners so they can bypass buying ethanol didn't help. You don't mess with a farmer's bottom-line, especially if they voted for Trump.
2824 2018-07-06 17:35:27 If oil goes to $150.00 a barrel then #tariffs and all of the #humptytrumpies plans will have been for not since it will cause a recession and every country will pull back and start licking their wounds and the #midterms will be a slaughter.
2825 2018-07-06 17:35:26 I don't understand why anybody would think an essential oil would help with that?????

2842 2018-07-06 17:34:12 in my CALM class c.1999 the oil industry gave presentations urging us to abandon post secondary and go straight to oil patch
2843 2018-07-06 17:34:11 Almost paid to get an oil change, just to find out that I have a free oil change at my dealership  I know it seems small, but I needed that news
2844 2018-07-06 17:34:05 Despite total lack of specifics in the statement today, officials telling me there is some real work and genuine ideas being looked at which could help on the Iran banking/oil payments front. We’ll have to see. But not impossible.
2845 2018-07-06 17:34:04 Banyak yang bilang, please try essential oil for stress. Orang ga tau aja daya penciuman gue kayaknya cuma tinggal 1/4  dari kecil keseringan radang tht.
2846 2018-07-06 17:34:02 I think the Iranian leader just accused The Great Frump of raising oil prices by 10 dollars a barrel with his tweets.

2852 2018-07-06 17:33:25 I love making pizza tortillas etc. I do the exact same thing. I’m careful and use an oil substitute. Don’t want the extras calories.

In the morning I just crave straight up carbs. No trick works. After 11 am I’m fine and get through my diet just fine.
2853 2018-07-06 17:33:15 The engine was aluminum. I used to pull over halfway through my 33-mile commute at least 3x/week to add a quart of oil.
2854 2018-07-06 17:33:06 There was no "controversy" @EPAScottPruitt was and is on cahoots with big oil to damage our Earth. Pruitt's blatant unchecked corruption
was his downfall. He was held accountable for his own actions by "the people". America is not his piggy bank.
2855 2018-07-06 17:33:03 So as I was sayin’ I was about to pop a fuse this morning. Tension headache coming on so I took about 2 eye droppers of CBD oil. That’s about 10drops. I’m stable now. #BehindTheGreenCurtain #LEGALIZECANNABIS #CBDHEALS

2864 2018-07-06 17:32:15 We leave as much oil as possible in the ground --> Less supply of oil --> higher prices of oil --> Increased demand for renewables... yes other oil exporters benefit, but so eventually will the renewables sector. The sooner it does the better.
2865 2018-07-06 17:32:15 No wounder that a natural gas and oil development province Alberta is number one on the list and Quebec is on the way down. @LiberalQuebec and @pierremoreauplq has just said "NO thanks" to 55K jobs from the gas industry and well paid jobs.

2869 2018-07-06 17:31:24 @grisdon3911 It's a pity that our brownish gov has granted c230 offshore @consumerwatch01 oil leases.
2870 2018-07-06 17:31:21 I should've known better since the time I went before and was getting a recall done and a simple oil change, they tried to sell me a $500 package before even looking at the car yet missed the 7 year old battery which died and left me stranded two months later.
2871 2018-07-06 17:31:20 what did you say the other day ? KIng Salmon was going to release additional oil ? I guess you found out that its Opec that controls the prices and the King aint leaving Opec for you.
2872 2018-07-06 17:31:15 I will!  Sounds like you have unsubstantiated theories. Here's some facts: Trump expelled diplomats, killed Russian oil, imposed sanctions, bombed one Russian ally, broke a bad deal with another, sold weapons to Putin's enemy. So what kind of deal is this?  Comment?

2880 2018-07-06 17:30:30 We can reprocess nuclear waste and use it in reactors multiple times, but nobody is doing that except france iirc. A lot of people in suits are like "oh no if we process the nuclear fuel someone could get it and make a dirty bomb" or something. Or they've got oil money i guess.
2881 2018-07-06 17:30:21 I’m a vet, but NOBODY has to join up to support oil cartels to know the military is like a religion - it’s ONLY ever cared about itself. And that is ALL militaries, EVER.
2882 2018-07-06 17:30:20 It has spiked up but only when the oil companies decided it was time to make more profits. Remember Exon/ Mobile 35 billion a quarter?

2899 2018-07-06 17:28:12 Do you have some type of facial oil that you might be able to mix in with it? I haven't tried that specific foundation and I don't know if that will do the trick, but I've heard of people with dry skin doing that with super matte foundations?

2905 2018-07-06 17:27:02 Alberta Oil and Gas is heavily invested in North East BC. Alberta helps out he BC economy. Love or hate any provincial government,end of the day we all need each other. Wish politicians would see this.
2906 2018-07-06 17:27:00 @CNN @wolfblitzer @AmbLocke @StephenMoore Now that @EPAScottPruitt has been ousted for failure to do job within ethics. Like china ,can the @EPA do their job finally and hold oil companies accountable for fracking/injection wells damaging local communities?
2907 2018-07-06 17:26:52 Oh I was wondering had you had a chance. I still feel greatly improved but keep forgetting to take it! It it CBD oil.. expect the ‘suppliers’ to start following 
2908 2018-07-06 17:26:37 On vacation last week:

Mom: looks like there's going to be a vegan coconut oil vendor at the farmer's market.

My daughters: oooh! 

Me: you kids and your fancy smancy skin products! Look at me! I don't use any products and my skin turned out fin-- oh wait, no it didn't. 
2909 2018-07-06 17:26:36 Again, actually—the second series of Tom Swifts was Victor Appleton II, whereas here we've apparently returned to the writer of such classics as Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle and Tom Swift and His Great Oil Gusher.
2910 2018-07-06 17:26:25 I am pleased to have eaten Global Guacamole during a portion of the #URUFRA match. Avacados from Mexico, tomatoes with sriracha (invented in Thailand), olive oil from Turkey, onions from, er, uh, America.

2918 2018-07-06 17:25:32 @Joshuathehippie Am currently listening to The Story in Stone and am absolutely loving it. Loved your description of the forging in the class. If you wan't just a tiny bit more accuracy in your description metal is typically quenched in oil as water will cause microfractures.

2920 2018-07-06 17:25:23 Is there really a choice!!?? I supply only the most exquisite Virgin Icelandic Cod Liver Oil    Discerning conquerors of the mortal plane are very aware! #thefishmonger
2921 2018-07-06 17:25:15 Yes Mr. Pruitt. It was not given to big oil which could care less about our environment. Your effort to clean the environment by stuffing trashbags full of big oil money into the trunk of your car is duly noted.
2922 2018-07-06 17:25:01 getting back rubs w baby oil at the beach 
2923 2018-07-06 17:24:55 no impact if not near the pipeline? really - landslide would carry + bury the pipe- spills leak n2 ground waters +flows of rainwater-carrying oil + toxic soup (chemicals) 'down' to nearby residents- keep on believing Man has control over acts of God + be zero contaminated-sure
2924 2018-07-06 17:24:51 Bt too much oil.y?
2925 2018-07-06 17:24:48 There is a simple way for our Great US President to fix this problem with "illegal" aliens from crossing our border. Place a 100% tax on all remittances going to all countries south of the border. Then, an embargo on all oil an gas from Mexico. That will pucker em up real tight..
2926 2018-07-06 17:24:46 Finally had time to get my baby an oil change today. About to go through the car wash too. She's way overdue
2927 2018-07-06 17:24:28 Bill do you own any oil stocks? If so you should get rid of them immediately

2929 2018-07-06 17:24:20 This post is anti-consumer: are you consumer watchdog or climate watchdog? You want higher oil prices with less supply?
2930 2018-07-06 17:24:19 Dude... its all abt lack of gov't revenue from that oil and gas revenue... 

Your big oil overlords won't allow proper royalties to be charged.

2933 2018-07-06 17:24:04 In the summer we like to go to the farmers market and buy tomatoes, and eat those with olive oil and sea salt, that's it! #FoodFri
2934 2018-07-06 17:23:58 Pen pushers making life or death decisions. It's oil made from a plant for crying out loud, the chemicals in prescription medication for epilepsy can leave you like a zombie. This is just cruel.

- a bag of trailmix with all the m&m's eaten out of it

- a box of lucky charms with no marshmallows

- cactus massage oil
2941 2018-07-06 17:23:00 My mom is a hairstylist and here’s a quick Hair growth tip: 
Mayonnaise
Avocado
Eggs
Olive oil
Fresh garlic 
Mix a little amount and put it in your hair and leave it for about an hour do this every 2 weeks for 2-3 months and you will see a big difference.

2943 2018-07-06 17:22:55 You’ve all missed the most important AudioPhoolery... the actual sort of Mains Power the Phoolery equipment is powered off. I’ve been informed there’s a hearable difference, whether it was generated by Hydro, Geothermal or natural gas, methane gas, coal or oil.... I KID YOU NOT!
2944 2018-07-06 17:22:52 As my grandmother used to say about food: just add a little more olive oil on there.

(Meaning add some extra love cause it can’t hurt!)

2949 2018-07-06 17:22:40 I use Avon dry oil spray. The original its the green one.
2950 2018-07-06 17:22:37 in the oil field with my momma
2951 2018-07-06 17:22:37 Indeed but pipe lines aren't worry free either.  Much safer than rail and we do need to get the oil to markets that will pay fair prices instead of selling at a discount.
2952 2018-07-06 17:22:29 But oil is a global market. Oil is fungible, just like soybeans. @TeamCavuto
2953 2018-07-06 17:22:26 All you need is some onions on your feet and some worm wood essential oil

2955 2018-07-06 17:22:13 Pour is the correct spelling to describe the action. Pore it's an orifice in your skin that excretes sweat and oil... This time the education systems failure showcases the critics
2956 2018-07-06 17:22:07 We need to add oil refineries to move to energy independence. Average build time = 5-7 years, but maybe a businessman and master negotiator can improve on that. What about expansion of existing refinery capacity?
2957 2018-07-06 17:22:06 Oil and Gas Commission keeps records of all poets, the white button under the B.C. Liberals in changing and shifting away from children 2/5
2958 2018-07-06 17:21:47 What about skin oil?
2959 2018-07-06 17:21:47 Without Oil you could not produce Wind or Solar.

2962 2018-07-06 17:21:43 pretty sure we dont go around stealing house pet pigs, and cooking them alive in the streets with burning oil by the thousands
2963 2018-07-06 17:21:41 I would second Jason and the Argan Oil as it is great for bringing moisture to the hair which helps it to retain colour from dye. ~Keilly
2964 2018-07-06 17:21:40 Hope, schools, streets have improved immensely in 20 years. Of course they’ve been deteriorating in the last 4-5 years of increased economic war and oil price drop. You just refuse reality to accept it and struggle to find a childish solution that is not a solution

2966 2018-07-06 17:21:19 When will north norfolk realise we don't give a rat's ass whether they are interested or not. But they WILL when we leave the union and they need our oil, energy and FRESH WATER. Have a good day.  #DissolveTheUnion
2967 2018-07-06 17:21:17 Lmao. Like they have to fry fish in separate oil
2968 2018-07-06 17:21:08 Bad precedent.Any time they hv issues,they will be blockading the road and the oil facility.
They may have had a point,but the method has serious implications for national security.
2969 2018-07-06 17:21:03 Agreed! When Sundial sold to Unilever, quality clearly changed. I mean, my Jamaican black castor oil conditioner went from brown to white and smelled totally different.
2970 2018-07-06 17:21:03 I will not be applying lotion to my body this summer. It’s too damn hot! I will rub some oil on my foot so it doesn’t get hard like big stone. Other than that...call me Ashy Krissy

2985 2018-07-06 17:19:31 Non oil exports are just 10%. Just $23.3b. Every foreigner knows what saudi product will sell in their home country. Why not take a chance and make this figure turn into $40b in 2-3 years? It is achievable and in line with #Vision2030. We have whole KAEC & KAFD to utilize!

2995 2018-07-06 17:18:38 Neither. USD acts as a value asset agianst domestic currency plus an inflation indicator for Iran's economy.
US dropout & looming sanctions on Iran's oil export decreases USD supply and escalates its exchange price.
Such speculations also fueled capital flight and demand for USD.

3000 2018-07-06 17:18:13 The Neocons would try but a destroyed Iran would be an acceptable second prize. They will station their mercenaries on the oil, like in Libya and Syria .... job done.
3001 2018-07-06 17:17:59 Some Tariffs? 14,000 according to what I've read. Obama unleashed the EPA to destroy coal, oil & natural gas while pouring 100's of millions of dollars into failures like Solyndra. Trump is looking to get rid of all tariffs & government subsidies.
3002 2018-07-06 17:17:58 I can respect leaders in the community who willed to separate.
Too many things being mixed together these days, things that don't mix like oil and water.
3003 2018-07-06 17:17:46 You associate the economic crisis to the government. But you’re wrong. People suffer because the country has been isolated and sabotaged, on top of the oil price collapse in 2014 (also driven by the US). People suffer from a war hidden by propaganda and that many refuse to see
3004 2018-07-06 17:17:37 Bullish for Oil and Petrol
3005 2018-07-06 17:17:34 The EU. ..have the fix for this trade deal turmoil. Eliminate all trade tariffs with the U.S. stop buying gas and oil from Russia, who will feel it economically..and stop China's dumping and cheating practices in their territory.
3006 2018-07-06 17:17:26 When I got to work 2 olive oil bottles and a six pack of beer was broken and had to clean it up. So off to a bad start but the I did a delivery &  the woman called one of the store managers and said I’m the best thing since sliced bread 
3007 2018-07-06 17:17:17 No. The current young generation and their deplorable work ethic, I would trust them to add oil to my tires.
3008 2018-07-06 17:17:11 @ScottPruittOK is a thief who ripped off American taxpayers of their money and robbed the Environmental Protection Agency of its hard earned reputation.

3016 2018-07-06 17:16:14 Please! ALL of you knew Pruitt was appointed because of his disdain for the EPA & his desire to roll back regulations to hurt the environment & help the oil & gas industry. You're also fully aware his successor is of the same mind. Don't pretend to care while you vote to confirm.
3017 2018-07-06 17:16:08 But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3018 2018-07-06 17:16:07 4 seasons.

To describe it any other way is a falsehood forced upon us all.
Remember these same experts in the 70’s said by the 90’s we would run of oil and the wells would come up empty.
Seasons that’s all it is.

3033 2018-07-06 17:13:53 So is oil.
3034 2018-07-06 17:13:47 Also Wyoming and Montana are beautiful vast wildlife areas. This man probably hunts and lives in the wilderness so hes afraid of having guns taken. He doesn’t seem to understand that this Administration plans to destroy as much of Fed. land,water and animals as possible For Oil.
3035 2018-07-06 17:13:46 Agree. It doesn't make us stop but refining our own oil (as much as possible) and increasing our exports is good for the country. On another note we should be more cynical in trade agreements with countries with appalling human rights violations.
3036 2018-07-06 17:13:31 Is the only vegetable at McDonald's the oil?
3037 2018-07-06 17:13:30 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! null
3038 2018-07-06 17:13:29 Were weapons found in Iraq? No!
How did they react?
Who cares!
For them its just about the oil and the dollars.
KACHING! 
3039 2018-07-06 17:13:28 This is not a smart decision. It's matter of public record that under Bush the US threatened Venezuela over Chávez increasing oil exports to China and China just said, "OK. The vig on your loan goes up." Washington backed down.
3040 2018-07-06 17:13:20 Best #LovettorLeaveIt moments this week: @joseiswriting being awesome as always (one of our best humans) and @jonlovett ranting about truffle oil WHICH IS DISGUSTING and he’s right about everything as usual.

3044 2018-07-06 17:12:47 We just got some new *Cloud Nine Massage Oil*
3045 2018-07-06 17:12:44 I honestly dont see the appeal of Starbucks.

Their coffee tastes like burnt motor oil & is disgusting.

I had it once, never again & I drink a ton of coffee every day.

I wouldnt drink that overpriced garbage even if it was free.
3046 2018-07-06 17:12:40 I mean with something like an oil drilling rig? Some should be able to drill 200-300 meters per day?
3047 2018-07-06 17:12:35 But...

My Oil of Olay 
Has negative effects on
My signs of ageing!

3049 2018-07-06 17:12:32 ใช้ดี เราทาแค่ตอนเช้านะ ไม่แพ้ ก็ผิวแข็งแรงทั่วๆไปค่ะ
สิวผดน้อยลง เลี้ยงแมวแล้วแพ้ขนมัน
แต่ไม่เห็นคุมมันได้เลย สำหรับเราอะไรก็คุมไม่ได้
สุดท้ายจบด้วยน้ำมันhemp seed oilทาหน้า(ลองกูเกิ้ลดู) ก็ค่อยๆชุ่มชื้น แบบไม่มัน

สรุป ในภาพไบโอเดิม คือเดอะเบสของเรานะ แต่หน้าเยิ้มมากค่ะ 555
3050 2018-07-06 17:12:24 If you actually understood economics 101, then you would fully know  the subtleties of the dismal science. It like moving an oil tanker. You would have to have an understanding of macro and micro economics to know that Trump is not responsible now for the economy. #wait2years
3051 2018-07-06 17:12:17 Chips, Ahoy could be the name of one of the dishes. But either way, don't get too excited. I'm opening up a competitor store right next door called Fry By Night. And then another across the road called Midnight Oil. I'm a doos like that.
3052 2018-07-06 17:12:16 Just blew one of my co-workers minds when I told him we about using rapeseed oil in the popcorn. Mainly because he didn't realise rapeseed was a thing
3053 2018-07-06 17:12:13 Gee, I thought they were there to monitor oil production levels, not the state of Middle East affairs. Who knew? #OOTT And thank you @chigrl for sparing us the pain of reading the whole thing!
3054 2018-07-06 17:12:02 Oil revenues are tiny percentage of UK exchequer inflows.   

Enjoy the game and thanks for the gas.
3055 2018-07-06 17:11:54 U.S. Onshore Oil Producers Facing ‘Reckoning’ as Prices Rise
3056 2018-07-06 17:11:42 Reversed the clean air act. No testing of drinking water.Oil pipe lines running through lakes(which leaking has already Happend),open up coal mines that pollute the air.Drumpf should close those mines and pay the miners their salaries they are making now to go to school.Any More?
3057 2018-07-06 17:11:38 Sweet oil on a cotton ball , put it in your ear and lay on your side with your ear down on pillow , the water will drain .works everytime
3058 2018-07-06 17:11:32 How can you advocate for increased rail safety (oil by rail) and release statement attacking pipeline construction? Reducing oil by rail would go a lot farther in safe guarding Canadians. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. Pick one or the other and lead.
3059 2018-07-06 17:11:26 I rather starve to death then kill children and take money from an oil rich man!
3060 2018-07-06 17:11:12 -1 box brownie mix/cake mix/cookie mix

3061 2018-07-06 17:11:11 I always hated ‘agile’ because to me it seemed like snake oil salesman selling common sense, boy my recent experiences made me reconsider that. so, maybe... leave ‘agile’ to scammers and call it ‘common sense’? :)
3062 2018-07-06 17:10:41 Then you don't know the facts boy. It's a dying country. It produces nothing the rest of the world wants, except oil. It's population is crashing, it's health care system is a joke and it's economy is in shambles. A true shit hole country.
3063 2018-07-06 17:10:31 About as mobile as an oil tanker Fabregas.
3064 2018-07-06 17:10:13 I was so determined to get tan yesterday I ditched the sunscreen for tanning oil and rubbed a gallon of it on and now I’m Clifford the big red dog

3066 2018-07-06 17:10:06 Thanks. Current trade is not fair to Americans. Been taken advantage of. Must act to get partners to open their closed markets.   Long term much better for USA.

3069 2018-07-06 17:10:01 getting my oil changed .
3070 2018-07-06 17:09:55 Pruitt's unrelenting attacks on our environment - which we was sworn to *protect*, not sellout to coal and oil lobbyists, while enriching himself with illegal perks - will take a "sizable toll on all of us" for years to come. Good riddance!
3071 2018-07-06 17:09:49 @350 As the EROI (Energy input to get output e.g. Tar Sands 5:1 1 barrel gets 5, Wind Turbine 20:1) descends for oil and the EROI for renewables climbs will we see a faster transition to renewables as the economic impacts of lower EROI were highlighted in 2008?
3072 2018-07-06 17:09:45 No wonder Libya is having such problems exporting,  they are using container ships vs oil tankers!!!!  #oott
3073 2018-07-06 17:09:43 Hot oil treatment? What’s that? Dm please
3074 2018-07-06 17:09:40 Good stuff. But the ones he missed are biggies - proportional representation and oil pipelines. His inaction on the plight of Sears employees losing their pensions is unconscionable.
3075 2018-07-06 17:09:31 Saudi Arabia’s oil company Saudi Arameco reduced the price for a barrel of oil by only 10 cent for the USA but 20 cent for Asia and 45 cent(!) for EU countries. What’s up with that @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #Oilprice

3083 2018-07-06 17:09:05 Y’all I rarely go out or do anything that would suggest I should wear a body glow oil, but I caved and bought some Sol de Janeiro body glow. Now I guess I have to start leaving my house  that ish was expensive. They sold out on their website, but thank god for Sephora.
3084 2018-07-06 17:09:04 I have euphemism for it - called ‘notes’.
3085 2018-07-06 17:09:03 Someone installed one of those incredible gas mileage gadgets on your car but the oil companies had him taken out before he could tell you.
3086 2018-07-06 17:09:00 Getting an oil change over my lunch break. Fuck, I'd forgotten how expensive these were. $86, even with a $10 coupon.

3090 2018-07-06 17:08:49 Off topic, but just trying to connect dots...maybe I’m totally off base, but is this all ultimately going to come down to oil/gas associations between Putin-trump and associates?
3091 2018-07-06 17:08:43 dingin, udara kayak gini bikin kulit kering. gw suka gatel sndr saking keringnya. jd gak jauh2 dari body oil. kalo kering kulitnya bersisik, enggak bgt dah~
3092 2018-07-06 17:08:39 The dialogue that will take place when Trump/Putin meeting happens: 

Trump: "I want to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Will you approve it & back me?"
Putin: "Only if you lift the oil sanctions."
Trump: "Done! No problem."

And the GOP cheers & claims the meeting is a success.

Laziness will ruin your life. You can’t  be lazy concerning your family life, your friendships, career, side hustles, your classes, your bills, your skin care regimen, your oil changes, your taxes... anything. Laziness will ruin your life.
3095 2018-07-06 17:08:20 Bayleigh is playing this chick with "I'm gonna put on an oil" #BB20
3096 2018-07-06 17:08:20 On 6th  July 1988 the production log of the Piper Alpha platform recorded an export of 138 294 barrels. of oil. Worth (then) $1 936 116. That was the final entry, by next morning 167 men were dead. Figures to bear in mind   when  Health and safety is described as 'red tape'

3118 2018-07-06 17:06:17 Yes, ORC was the Oil Runtime Compiler. OIL is the Optimized Inner Loop, or Intermediate Language, or something. But it's the same project.
3119 2018-07-06 17:06:16 Suing oil companies for pollution is like suing gun manufacturers for crime.  No one is forcing you to buy the oil.  All the commiefornians can ride their bicycles / electric scooters to work.

3126 2018-07-06 17:05:27 I didn't claim that symbolic patriotism was some sort of ginseng-like snake oil that will cure everything that ails us. I simply claimed that publicly expressing a shared identity early and often could help create the social trust necessary for a better politics.
3127 2018-07-06 17:05:25 Oil prices are stock market driven (i.e. speculators) has little or nothing to do with the hallowed supply and demand bullshit.

3131 2018-07-06 17:04:56 We create tens of Millions of Refugees. It's our thing. Central Bank wants control of oil or currency.

3132 2018-07-06 17:04:44 Nothing a well-placed oil slick can’t handle!
3133 2018-07-06 17:04:43 Means I need to be there to take care of that itch. Where the hell I'd my aloe vera or maybe just some baby oil lol.
3134 2018-07-06 17:04:42 In Russia, we used to do this: pour a little sunflower oil on black bread, cut garlic and eat. That's really cool! hah wtf why I say this
3135 2018-07-06 17:04:38 Because you must really understand how politics works, and then you’ll get the message.  The bottom line is that the Elites of both countries are in bed together,how do you think ExxonMobil drills and invests in Russia oil and gas,and then we want to sanction them. SmokeScreen!
3136 2018-07-06 17:04:29 Anytime baby!
If you plan on keeping it, do a hot oil treatment. It'll make your hair completely softer and easier to comb.
Good luck!

3138 2018-07-06 17:04:10 I try avoid oil as well. I have very oily hair
3139 2018-07-06 17:04:01 This is a terrible and foolish plan. We need to stop using fossil fuel.  Our environment is being ruined, we are losing jobs we could have, oil spill would ruin our coastal area. It’s a stupid idea perpetrated by fossil fuel industry. Renewables: that’s our future!

3161 2018-07-06 17:02:15 So much propaganda.. it’s no wonder people believe big oil and energy companies. It’s a good way to cover up oil spills pipeline explosions and avoid the whole accountability thingy. #learnthefactsaboutoil
3162 2018-07-06 17:02:10 When CBD oil was legalized and marketed as a cure all hahah - water chilled me out and made me sleep like a babyyyy
3163 2018-07-06 17:02:10 Love this! So delicious. A good amount of sesame oil and soy sauce on it is a MUST!
3164 2018-07-06 17:02:09 When you go to get your oil changed and you have to pretend like you understand the issues they say your car is having. 

And then they say the cost and you have to act like you're not worried but then leave stressed bc wtf are spark plugs. #cars #imanurse #callingdad

3167 2018-07-06 17:02:03 Snake oil.
3168 2018-07-06 17:02:03 Yet you are okay with Pruitt wasting tax payer dollars on his personal expenses, my tax payer dollars should not be squandered by a lazy EPA Administrator who is deregulating environmental protections so greedy oil, coal and energy companies...
3169 2018-07-06 17:02:00 Teething essentials:

- Set of bib bandanas. 
- Variety of textures for baby to chew on.
- Soft wet rag to massage baby’s gums.
- Lots of snuggles.
- Do NOT buy any drops or homeopathic potions. It’s all snake oil.

3174 2018-07-06 17:01:39 What awful news. I also remember that the loco in the picture was written off in a horrific crash near Eccles when it ran into the back of an oil train.

3181 2018-07-06 17:00:55 @MaranelloBMW you guys are ripping people off.  Your service department charges $5 disposal of waste oil when we get oil change done. That is against the law. You have to recycle old oil for free by law.  Go read people.  I will be calling BBB.

3187 2018-07-06 17:00:18 I’m such a good daughter. I brought my mom’s car to the dealer to get checked and the oil changed... you are welcome mommmm!!! I try to do at least half of what you do for me, u amazing human
3188 2018-07-06 16:59:37 Exactly . We can be as responsible as possible but changing light bulbs won't slow the growth of big oil's emissions (amongst other risks). There is such a thing as government responsibility. Instead we have oil & state as indistinguishable from one another. I blame them 100%
3189 2018-07-06 16:59:23 Beauty Oil nya 60.000, Blacksoap nya 70.000. 
3190 2018-07-06 16:59:21 Oily skin ke?  Better use tea tree oil ingredients..  Aku dah guna nano white fresh hampir setahun.  Alhamdulillah kulit makin okay..  Apa2pun must consistent usage
3191 2018-07-06 16:59:20 I'm not sure about the kind of waiver, but Haley's interview in India seems that they are not considering to sanction India for its activities in Chabahar. Her main focus was on oil.
3192 2018-07-06 16:59:17 Ha ha ha! No, seriously... Trump & Friends have investments in oil; no interests in protecting the environment. Clean air and water don’t matter.
3193 2018-07-06 16:59:10 ここで働けば・・
3194 2018-07-06 16:58:55 Where are the jobs? No coal jobs. Oil is getting the mining push. 22K jobs lost in retail. Medical jobs are up but these are skilled worker jobs. Jobs in Finance are up but again skilled college educated workers. Where are the jobs u promised for the average American? Wages?
3195 2018-07-06 16:58:51 When negotiating for an economic change or shift, it similar to turning an oil tanker, slow and constant.  At what point do we continue to have trade deficits? Our debt is linked to unfunded mandates, and our revenue is linked to tax revenue and other revenue generating assets.
3196 2018-07-06 16:58:43 @LindsayGrahamSC please come into the 21st century and insist upon an EPA chief who will actually protect our environment. I want clean air and water, not lead and oil, for my grandchildren. #ClimateChangeIsReal
3197 2018-07-06 16:58:32 Hm, do you mean not the same as what the Rdio guy worked on? "Oil Runtime Compiler" appears in a lot of places in that TF code, the source matches, as does commit  history, so I'm fairly sure it's the same ORC project @gnuradio used.
3198 2018-07-06 16:58:29 Hope we see that to see some other oil names move.

3205 2018-07-06 16:57:48 Real easy tendies: get thin boneless skinless cutlets, coat them in olive oil, coat them in seasoned bread crumbs, bake on 350 for 30 minutes. You can skip flour, eggs, a fryer, etc. on a day when you don't have a lot of time between bombing job interviews and arguing on 4Chan

3208 2018-07-06 16:57:14 I really only been wearing this little oil for perfume cause I gotta buy more and I get so much compliments on it 
3209 2018-07-06 16:57:11 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating Fat cakes instead of rubbing the oil on his head.!
3210 2018-07-06 16:57:07 You do. It's called oil.
3211 2018-07-06 16:56:59 I guess we just have to wait it out till the Oil get themselves in the category of "Good Team".  With the disappointment of the last # of years, I can understand the negativity but I sure as hell don't like it.  Anyways, GO OIL GO!
3212 2018-07-06 16:56:57 got castor oil into my eyes, suddenly that shit turn evil 
3213 2018-07-06 16:56:31 When you eat home cooked food you are sure of good quality oil. Do ask such posh restaurants which cooking oil do they use. Most of the time you will be surprised to know that they use cheap quality cooking oil.

3215 2018-07-06 16:56:13 Pro choice alone puts me at odds with Trump and his supporters. Protecting the environment...not allowing my state to have anymore oil rigs killing our coastline.

3231 2018-07-06 16:54:23 India has a waiver for its Chabahar port which is more important to them than the oil, so it makes sense that they are out of Iran's oil business.

3233 2018-07-06 16:54:19 They first flooded the market to under cut the shale oil industry now they are raising prices to hurt our economy. This is why we need to be energy independent.
3234 2018-07-06 16:54:14 Stephen is making me get my own oil changed today... What is this nonsense.
3235 2018-07-06 16:53:57 I just sold 2 $1000 jobs back to back 2 different cars with the same oil leak

3286 2018-07-06 16:48:12 You know full well the replacement of Pruitt is a former coal advocate & lobbyist. His leadership will be for coal & Big Oil before environment. He's dedicated to rolling back all Obama era decisions about protecting the environment. He's bad news.

3292 2018-07-06 16:47:51 Yes....potatoes and oil,but i couldn't remember the shape so it's chunks not chips
3293 2018-07-06 16:47:49 The current prices of carbon credits is a manifestation of the world unwillingness to tackle climate change...carbon credit prices should be pegged to the oil prices or even more. Lets safe planet Earth and pay us for our renewable energy projects #10MWSolar
3294 2018-07-06 16:47:46 this is about the pimping of a brokerage that hails current high oil prices to the possibility over the next dozen years of other price spikes higher.  The stark reality is that for most of the next dozen years oil prices will be mostly influenced by any inflation of the dollar
3295 2018-07-06 16:47:45 Getting closer and closer to my December 31, 2017 Inversion call but still needs oil to fade to bring down global PMI data. Look for this to happen August 31st and on until the years end. Big take away No Recession in 2019 if yield invert
3296 2018-07-06 16:47:40 Racist fever! Everything @realDonaldTrump does is because of a deep seed of racism and anger planted in him by his father! 
He has offered up our democracy to dictators who fancy nothing but land, oil, air space and oppressing groups of people #TraitorPotus #TraitorGOP

3298 2018-07-06 16:47:28 It's paradoxically a sign that Big Oil knows it's a declining industry. It has cut reserves from 15 to 10 years, worrying oil demand could peak by 2030.
3299 2018-07-06 16:47:21 "No, thank you. I'll take a basic oil change." He low-key started giving me a full-service treatment. It at least had a happy ending, bc my Gramps called him out, and he lied, saying he did that to all the cars. So, he had to do all three of my Papa's cars just like mine, lol.

3460 2018-07-08 23:40:18 How you apply the oil is not so critical, but use sparingly. I'd start with a dab on the filament end or a thin coat in the first couple inches of filament. It's easy to put too much. A little does go a long way but also makes all the difference.

3468 2018-07-08 23:39:37 Agreed. China spends more on renewables than Europe & US combined. China leads in electrification of rail, buses, cars, e-bikes, you name it. China is becoming the pivotal country in New Energy transition. Meanwhile US hides behind near oil independence & tariffs on solar panels.

3472 2018-07-08 23:38:51 For PHYSICAL THINGS which are in limited supply and difficult or time consuming to produce, this is true. (e.g. crude oil, to a lesser extent, money)

Rights however, are not physical things. They're freedoms and (legally speaking) entitlements. Not even close to physical things.

3479 2018-07-08 23:38:26 Nice try. Wait till more people know it is a ploy to get off Saudia Arabia oil.  The War machine we are needs for it to happen. That’s why “Liberal News” lets the poisonous process continue.
3480 2018-07-08 23:38:24 boil some pasta and toss it in a pan with olive oil, lots of garlic, chopped parsley, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes

3482 2018-07-08 23:37:22 That feels like it's still halfway to my theory. (I love Sunny D, but part of me thinks the oil would be healthier.)
3483 2018-07-08 23:37:21 "Cutting government programs" is shorthand for inflicting suffering on the vulnerable. I'll believe people are serious about reducing government spending when the defense budget gets cut and we stop subsidising big oil.
3484 2018-07-08 23:36:57 I’ve left it without refrigeration for about 6 weeks without issues. Add more of the other flavors if you like. I like it on pizzas, grilled cheese, Vegan garlic bread (just add margarine and more garlic), ALL pastas and it’s probably excellent on olive oil misted popcorn too!

3490 2018-07-08 23:36:16 Crude price is going to be very crude shortly. Start cutting your fuel consumption by at least 10 percentage. Oil companies won't talk as they can't think and ink beyond rule books.

3500 2018-07-08 23:34:38 Got up one fine Sunday morning and decided I'd do a good, and cook my younger siblings breakfast so the folks could sleep in.  All went well, got the bacon and scrambled eggs done and they looked great.  Only problem was I mistook karo syrup for oil.  The eggs were...sweet.

3504 2018-07-08 23:33:22 Chavez's "Bolivarian Revolution" was a watershed change that ended the looting of Venezuelan oil for outside interests and ensured oil revenues would be used to benefit average people. That's when the real socialist model was instituted.

3515 2018-07-08 23:31:19 1) Oil and Lucic decide a move would be best for all parties.
2) Pre-draft lots of balls in the air, looked like something was going to happen.
3) All palatable deals fell through.
4) Parties decide best course "now" is to quash all rumors.
5) For Sale sign remains on front yard.
3516 2018-07-08 23:31:11 People who trash big government are often the first to line up when they need help (Alaskan oils spills, gulf shore oil leak, Katrina). It’s more they only like THEIR big government assistance. But others are freeloaders.

3531 2018-07-08 23:29:34 It's always about oil and petrodollar.  Since Iran has decided to forego the petrodollar, the oligarchs  running the US are pissed and they want their vengeance.

3540 2018-07-08 23:27:50 Nope, experience is a must. The second you remove it as a measurement of fitness you open the door for the first snake oil salesman who is willing to say whatever it takes without a record to measure it against.

That's *exactly* how Trump happened.
3541 2018-07-08 23:27:50 You got my vote.

3562 2018-07-08 23:23:38 A lot. Which is why they shouldn’t get any more money from us anyways. We need oil because it essential. We should never gave them any money for them to use on terrorism.

3565 2018-07-08 23:23:05 All Keto 

It's about 90% of what I need for 15 days of meals. Still need to get sesame seed oil and avocados. Plus I'll need more veggies next week. The supplements will obviously last longer, but I'm thinking this is a $200+/person/month diet.

3568 2018-07-08 23:22:53 Now that I think about it, the Glassmen Alumni Ensemble was one of the inaugural SoundSport teams in 2013. We performed with Star United and Jersey Surf's Surftones outside of Lucas Oil that year.

I seem to be a SoundSport guy. :D
3569 2018-07-08 23:22:49 Oil pastels are my jammmm in that area
3570 2018-07-08 23:22:25 Soon. Electricity won't. Be a problem
Have an induction boiler rather than gas get rid of gas altergether and oil  just go electric
3571 2018-07-08 23:22:19 My mom did the same thing they just want us to value our time and labor I gues jekslspxoccooc
3572 2018-07-08 23:22:19 This argument is absurd. You know where the money is? DENYING climate change. Can you imagine how much oil companies would pay to find evidence that climate change was false? The problem is, they knew it was happening 30 years ago.
3573 2018-07-08 23:22:18 Hot pepper, preferably ghost or italian, mix with oil and water and spread on tomato plant has worked for us.
3574 2018-07-08 23:22:11 This guy is an oil block
3575 2018-07-08 23:21:28 Wait. That's two errands. Gotta change my oil too 
3576 2018-07-08 23:21:24 just like, heat some garlic and onion and spices in oil, then throw in some thin slices of chicken, and it's probably good
3577 2018-07-08 23:21:17 I need time
no heroin
No alcohol
 no nicotine
Do not ask for help
 no caffeine
But dynamite and turpentine
I need oil for gasoline
Explosive like kerosene
With a lot of octane and free of lead
A fuel like gasoline
3578 2018-07-08 23:21:15 We do watermelon, basil, and feta with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Great summer salad!
3579 2018-07-08 23:21:04 Every time Cub goes running in the tall wet grass or sage he has deer ticks on his neck and underbelly. We do a tick check like clock work every night before the sun goes down. They are really bad this year. Rubbing alcohol works better than olive oil.

3601 2018-07-08 23:17:37 @carrotsun probable a daft question but I am a tan accelerator virgin lol, I have the watermelon spray (omg it smells amazing) when I spray the oil on do I need to rub it into the skin or is just spraying it on ok? Does it make a difference?
3602 2018-07-08 23:17:36 when you’re doing a hot oil treatment & it’s sooo hot outside that you just sit under the sun instead of a dryer 
3603 2018-07-08 23:17:34 I have no idea but my mouth tastes like oil and pepsi combines
3604 2018-07-08 23:17:34 On Sundays I do coconut oil hair masks

3611 2018-07-08 23:16:21 I’d go with drinking and ask Aunt Sherree for venison! You have to add oil to cook, it’s so lean. Maybe 50 lbs I need to get rid of until oct 1, when season begins
3612 2018-07-08 23:16:09 Don’t forget the Millennial act. Abolishing them from everything.
3613 2018-07-08 23:15:59 Yes I agree with that. Maybe If there was no oil no one would care about saddam Hussein or khamenei torturing people or ruining young people's lives.
3614 2018-07-08 23:15:52 No outrage only praise 4 Putin. There are many more paramount issues 2 discuss. For example, canceling all sanctions, leaving the NATO alliance & how 2 ensure Republicans are re-elected in the midterm elections & of course how 2 win in 2020. It's all about Russian Oil & wealth.
3615 2018-07-08 23:15:37 #Oil #oilprices #SaudiArabia #mbs #aramco Conspiracy theory coming true. Why is the price of a barrel of oil being forced to rise.  Cause Aramco couldn’t go public at $45/barrel. Consumers end up holding the bag again.

3625 2018-07-08 23:13:57 In 2011, Scott Pruitt, then AG of Oklahoma got a letter from Devon Energy (an oil company),  They were asking foor regulations to be lifted.  He then copied and pasted it to his State letterhead and sent it to the EPA.

That is worse then plagerism.
3626 2018-07-08 23:13:52 Drizzled my sweet potatoes in coconut oil  instead of extra virgin oil this time
3627 2018-07-08 23:13:51 It's a little pricey but it's worth it if u tryna go cheap use coconut oil & water
3628 2018-07-08 23:13:48 one of my favourite unhealthy but super tasty amalgams:

fry bacon bits
add chicken bits and fry them too
take it off the heat and drain the oil
grate a lot of cheese over it
grill it all in the pan
probably have some fruit too to offset the lack of healthiness

Who paid for the Wall Street bailouts? 
Who paid for the automobile industry bailouts?
Who continues to pay for Big Oil subsidies?
Democrats & Republicans are both to blame.

3676 2018-07-08 23:07:27 I just don’t want oil to spike too high too fast to kill demand and accelerate economic downturn. Stay high enough for E&P/svc etc to generate nice profits and keep worldwide growth moving forward for longer. Diesel could be an issue if we can’t get enough heavy crude to refine

3707 2018-07-08 23:02:25 work, cuman tea tree oil di aku jatuhnya dia mempercepat proses jerawatnya, jadi kaya jerawatnya cepet keluar. gitu si di aku
3708 2018-07-08 23:02:09 Vg and Pg are extracted thinner oils used in vape juices because they can combust easier. Actual CBD oil is usually extracted from the seed or a cbd rich cannabis plant
3709 2018-07-08 23:02:02 Wondering what makes an "Inspirational Talk"? It's a researcher's work and what they think the future of supramolecular chemistry would be. Prime example - Prof. Wooley's work on a potential solution to oil spills using the supramolecular chemistry of bottle-brush polymers.
3710 2018-07-08 23:01:42 The thought of oil spills across that glorious land and waterways makes me ache all over. All the so-called 'liberals' approving these pipelines need to be voted out. Yes, oily pretty boy @JustinTrudeau, I do mean you, you oil-soaked sellout.
3711 2018-07-08 23:01:32 Can’t wait for mine to arrive. My favourite balm and marine cream but 2 firsts in eye cream and oil. X
3712 2018-07-08 23:01:21 RTing that propagandist and snake oil salesman map guy shows your lack of credibility.
3713 2018-07-08 23:01:15 هههههههه
3714 2018-07-08 23:01:14 Yes oil y? HAHAHAHA 
3715 2018-07-08 23:01:04 I also know someone that concentrated a big chunk of his portfolio in oil and gas pipeline MLP stocks because they were tax efficient and ignored sector weighting, commodity prices, & other issues. He ended with significant losses because he wasn't focused on the right issues.
3716 2018-07-08 23:00:57 No war for oil man
3717 2018-07-08 23:00:50 "Can Do" is fine... but Snake Oil Salesmen Carpetbaggers and Holy Rollers are bad news in anybodies country Americans have an inflated sense of their own abilities usually steal others ideas  apply large resources and re-sell them as their own...#BSdetector on +10
3718 2018-07-08 23:00:34 once we sprayed canola oil on the pole to the bird feeder. Um...the squirrels didn’t like that very much.  But boy was it funny to watch!

3720 2018-07-08 23:00:17 I just spent $80 on an oil change for my car. Being an adult is hard 
3721 2018-07-08 23:00:15 I've heard this argument before.  As if all these people can benefit anywhere close to the money big oil and the rest stand to to lose.  People are dumb.
3722 2018-07-08 23:00:03 @lucylou87 I really think that CBD Oil Topical Cream Would Help Your Skin. I saw a video of it helping a child with extremely bad scaley skin. I hope it helps. I’m a mother of a 5yr old. It breaks my heart seeing people go threw stuff like that.

3724 2018-07-08 23:00:01 A cucumber salad with Italian dressing or with oil and vinaigrette sounds so good right now 
3725 2018-07-08 22:59:48 I'm fully aware that coconut oil has a low melting point but it's been in my room all day as is 100% liquid. That makes application a little more awkward.
3726 2018-07-08 22:59:39 Regretting that I haven't tried the coconut oil hair treatments before today. Smooth and silky  Jumping, and staying, on that #kimkardashian #bandwagon
3727 2018-07-08 22:59:29 Lesson learned: don’t get tipsy and decide to make pierogies. Especially leaving a pan of oil to get too hot so it spits like crazy when you add the pierogies
3728 2018-07-08 22:59:19 Because the super wealthy control the government and shape public perception through propaganda without us knowing it, and because wars are waged for resources like oil though in the name of spreading "freedom" and "democracy" or deterring an amped-up threat, so Orwellian.
3729 2018-07-08 22:59:10 First : Get rid of all the workers (Somalians & others) that came to Alberta to work  when they need workforce so badly. Second: The somaliens street gangs in Surrey BC) who moved from Alberta after Oil rush.
3730 2018-07-08 22:59:06 Black seed oil for the face. Pretty much anything with coconut oil or cocoa butter for the body.
3731 2018-07-08 22:58:58 He was an awful human for 70 years before running for President. He clearly broke laws his whole business life. There’s solid evidence he worked with Russia. He is a snake oil salesmen...and you went all in on it.
3732 2018-07-08 22:58:30 うー、どうにも気だるい……
3733 2018-07-08 22:58:28 I love how all these people who want to ship dirty oil to China are so concerned about human waste being dumped in the ocean. SMH

3739 2018-07-08 22:57:42 Monica is the popular girl who was in good with the drug dealers and Brandy is the church girl who you knew could sing because she wouldn’t stop ever telling you she could. Both are oil and water... a friendship could never work.
3740 2018-07-08 22:57:27 When our shit runs out, you won’t have any oil uno, so you’ll be back to your old carriage days. You’ve always been a great country? If you mean the wars, king Henry the eighth then SUREE what an awesome country
3741 2018-07-08 22:57:22 Who changes their own oil?
3742 2018-07-08 22:57:08 A big thank you to all those who visited us yesterday. 
Top sellers were surprising...coci & oil soaps- relaxi & peppermint essential oils. Think we can guarantee that if we diffuse a blend on the day, that's what we'll sell!
3743 2018-07-08 22:56:48 My wife had this happen 3 times. Twice for a house and once for land. They are drilling for gas and oil around us and they get houses for guys to live in. They use cash in full for houses. It really sucks. I feel your pain.
3744 2018-07-08 22:56:44 How to make the best fuckin’ lamb chops on the block : 
Marinade chops in olive oil,pepper,lemon rind,garlic
Pan sear those fuckers for 3 minutes per side in a cast iron skillet
Pop them in the oven at 375 F for 8-10 minutes
Let them finish cooking/cool for 5 minutes on a plate
3745 2018-07-08 22:56:38 Red Ken must have done, he was doing deal Chavez for oil. And he has now resigned from the Labour Party for some comments about Hitler supporting Zionism, so I'd be surprised if he didn't upset George W.
3746 2018-07-08 22:56:20 When will get the money back from the incompetent and frankly indecent use of oil revenues? No fund set up. Bleed us dry then moan. Pompous
3747 2018-07-08 22:56:08 Be ready, apply some oil before arrival.
3748 2018-07-08 22:56:06 Se posso darti un consiglio compra bio oil: lo metti tutti i giorni al mattino e alla sera e dopo un mese va tutto meglio
3749 2018-07-08 22:55:41 I’m not saying that Saudis are bad people. Not at all. But the leaders knew about and have financial ties to those terrorists. And Trump sucks up to them because of oil money. It’s an example of his limitless hypocrisy.
3750 2018-07-08 22:55:39 Wow. Winning. Wow. NK. Russia. Crimea. Trade war. China. 3,000 Missing children. Oil prices. EU. NATO. Manafort. Flynn. Cohen. Papa. Gates. Jared Mideast peace plan. Infrastructure. Health care for everyone said trump.
3751 2018-07-08 22:55:38 This is why you should use oil based lube instead
3752 2018-07-08 22:55:29 I asked.  He's too busy selling snake oil.
3753 2018-07-08 22:55:15 Get rid of Zinke. We need a secretary who wants to expand and improve the parks, not sell them off to the mining, gas and oil companies.

3756 2018-07-08 22:54:11 Sicily is top of my list. I can store my sun creams,shower oil,hair goodies & perfume
3757 2018-07-08 22:54:08 It was a few letters away from 'Bonkers', which is what we always called it.

I remember the scene where Adrian Lester finds a Roman oil lamp lying on the ground in a tunnel; it's not what they're looking for, so he chucks it over his shoulder. Yeah, you're an archaeologist.
3758 2018-07-08 22:53:55 Yes, oil :) the oil that you suckers buy, and we evolved in fifty years to what we are now- one of the most evolved cities when the UK took hundreds of years to evolve :)
3759 2018-07-08 22:53:53 Omg I just the most odd and weird phone ever. It was an automated voice that said don’t hang up it’s the profit that want to sell me this amazing oil.
3760 2018-07-08 22:53:35 Life is good. My sister-in-law tonight just gave me the latest @ScottAdamsSays "Dilbert Gets Re-accommodated". As an oil company research mathematician once told me, it's not until one retires that one again looks at Dilbert as a comic rather than as a documentary.
3761 2018-07-08 22:53:32 Yea, well you obviously don’t know that Pres. Trump had already spoken with Saudi Arabia to counterbalance Iran’s response in which they already agreed to send more oil our way.
3762 2018-07-08 22:53:13 I discovered recently that Bertolli Light  has some palm oil in it so I am finishing up last tub of their margarine

Had always thought it was made with Olive oil but Palm oil is part of 22% other vegetable oils 
Next shop have to look for replacement 

#stoppingpalmoil
3763 2018-07-08 22:53:11 Let's get our #oilrefineries up and working, then #drillbabydrill @SarahPalinUSA and become even more independent! Stop relying on #muslims to refine our oil. Or at least let #Israel do it for us! 
3764 2018-07-08 22:53:06 Best Snake Oil on the market!  Guaranteed you live to be 100!
3765 2018-07-08 22:52:45 what really hurts is that for 1400 years, they have beaten woman into submission and brainwashed them to think they are inferior, to say nothing of the physical violence and that males can do no wrong....and the west deals with for their oil. #stupidity @FreeSecular
3766 2018-07-08 22:52:45 i know... baby oil is made out of material oil 
3767 2018-07-08 22:52:32 Welcome to Oregon:

If you don't drive a Jeep and have a beard while smelling like Patchouli oil you'll be asked to leave.
3768 2018-07-08 22:52:07 I want to know. Exact amounts, quite frankly! Squelching scientific facts in order to push business agendas is getting to be our MO. This is just one more swamp deal along with denying climate change to promote coal and oil business! Morally and ethically bankrupt!
3769 2018-07-08 22:51:52 Gonna mess up the Tues Right & Righter report for sure.
3770 2018-07-08 22:51:52 Where’s the place(s)to buy CBD Oil?
3771 2018-07-08 22:51:35 58 looks like this! No filters. No botox. 36 years in the sun with baby oil roof top tanning.   I look like Jeffrey sister I'll take it.
3772 2018-07-08 22:51:17 Were uprooted around me. Oil socked tree roots  saturated with gooey oil stuff. We got wet me and my boyfriend . He got deathly sick me too kind ok went into hospital told where we were staying they went into freak out Mose called code red quarantined us gave him like 15 antibiot
3773 2018-07-08 22:51:04 When I drive 45 miles to get olive oil and walk 2 miles to the store. If you know me, you know... #anythingforfood
3774 2018-07-08 22:50:54 *grins and gives your arse a slap* all done, ele *reaches over and grabs a towel, wiping the excess oil off your body*
3775 2018-07-08 22:50:53 Stewart, was the Puget Sound bound tanker traffic all from Alaska? In the past I also recall some foreign oil, including small amounts from Russia.
3776 2018-07-08 22:50:46 I'll give you most of that, but Lenny is damn fine. * waves from Gitmo

3778 2018-07-08 22:50:21 Trying to find ways to relieve my general anxiety. Burning sandalwood oil, making a regimented schedule to follow. Forcing myself to engage in periods of relaxation and meditation throughout the day.
3779 2018-07-08 22:50:20 use a little bit of coconut oil after washing your hair
3780 2018-07-08 22:50:08 Grudges, keeping grudges brings Oil to your soul. All it causes is destruction and pettiness to the world around you.

3784 2018-07-08 22:49:30 Nobe today Joe Igbokwe has been doing "Work no Pay" for APC. He is the gift that keeps on giving. The kin pesin you go ask, "did they send you?"

3787 2018-07-08 22:49:05 Wouldn't it be ironic if Popeye's Chicken was cooked in Olive Oil?
3788 2018-07-08 22:49:02 I have realised after my 3rd time using castor oil I am definitely allergic to it - my scalp is on fire
3789 2018-07-08 22:48:48 I love how people talk about ‘well funded speculation’ like the oil lobby is some Mom and Pop store front. Did you read the Mother Jones article or too many big words?
3790 2018-07-08 22:48:45 Yehi tu mushkil Hai; AWP maybe but too small.
3791 2018-07-08 22:48:22 This is of course in no way scientific, but I do feel better overall after taking CBD oil for the past 7 days. I’ve had the mental energy I’ve been lacking and have been able to get outside and walk/bike 5 days this week (thanks to the milder temps the last few days too).
3792 2018-07-08 22:47:31 That article doesn’t mention anything about oil being used to make solar panels.
3793 2018-07-08 22:47:24 Lmao! It was something about the oil flowin and get to hoein

3799 2018-07-08 22:45:30 Call it your home all you want. But if we Americans find some oil over there. It’s boutta be our home .
3800 2018-07-08 22:45:18 DJT sounds Looney tunes but he's crazy like a fox- he knows exactly what he's doing-adjusts spiel to audience then sells himself compare relatively sober Fox interviews to foaming at mouth rallies - it's a snake oil salesman con job @realDonaldTrump is  disgusting, a traitor!
3801 2018-07-08 22:45:15 Not anymore. Pouring the old oil in the gutter is frowned upon now.
3802 2018-07-08 22:45:12 As far as I know it’s good for all types but you might want to google that. According to the Sephora skin machine thingy I have dry skin so I over produce oil. The soap is great. It helps the bumps on my upper arms too
3803 2018-07-08 22:45:05 Then maybe you ought understand that sanctions on Russia stay, and it’s not always about the bottom line. Do you think we don’t know about the oil drilling That those sanctions are preventing. Grow a set, you have enough, integrity counts for more.
3804 2018-07-08 22:44:45 Oreos aren't totally vegan. They contain palm oil.
3805 2018-07-08 22:44:42 olive oil and sea salt, or a similar scrub also
3806 2018-07-08 22:44:25 So if your son doesn't know how to use a drill gun, is that on you?  I mean, I get that you need to show him how to change the oil in a car. But I didn't show him how to play Fortnite, and he's pretty good at that! #parentfail
3807 2018-07-08 22:44:14 I do not oil the beard.
3808 2018-07-08 22:44:05 Announcing The Texas Alliance of Energy Producers White Paper on Produced Water in Texas. This proposal will build on a previous White Paper by Lyons and Tintera (2014)
The working title is "A Fresh Look at Produced Water: Policy and Regulations in Texas, view from the oil field
3809 2018-07-08 22:44:04 By late summer 2018, oil futures will flip from "contango" into "backwardation", ushering in sharper inventory drawdowns and higher oil prices.
3810 2018-07-08 22:43:27 It actually is almost as bad at the late 70's with the oil pipeline,  crime increased horribly then. (Same time as Robert Hansen was operating,  the "butcher baker" I think the numbers are high, but our population has tripled since then as well...
3811 2018-07-08 22:43:16 All my coconut oil is liquid how does the saying go @_donniiiii ? 
3812 2018-07-08 22:43:06 Anyone know anything that genuinely works for damaged hair?? Tried coconut, argan and Moroccan oil and none of them help 
3813 2018-07-08 22:43:01 Game 11 between Best Chevrolet and Southland Hogs will begin at 6:00. Retif Oil/Gauthier Amedee will immediately follow at @KRStadium.
3814 2018-07-08 22:42:06 I have the body oil!
3815 2018-07-08 22:41:59 Oil crisis 1973, End of Bretton Woods System, Steel Crisis, stockmarket Crash, monetary policies, recessions, shocking high energy Prices, Iranian Revolution triggering a load of cost-effective measures on labour and production.
3816 2018-07-08 22:41:57 Just left the biggest cult of @younglivingeo users on my last assignment- “I’m stressed &  need some oil, I’ve got a cold give me thieves”.  I think they ask management for a diffuser and got refused.
3817 2018-07-08 22:41:56 I think my first neck oil was at End of the Road when you first supplied the artist riders. Must have had a gamma ray too right?...
3818 2018-07-08 22:41:44 That Saudi Arabia has something on us and it is more than just oil. 

Literally every president kowtows to them like no other country in the world.
3819 2018-07-08 22:41:40 Ibin abdulwahab lived long before Britain was involved in saudi arabia when oil was discovered. Read history again.
3820 2018-07-08 22:41:35 The “shale oil price hike” was a one and done thing. That will not - or better yet - shall not happen again. Because the reverse effect of it, well that doesn’t need to be brought up. 
At $70-75 is profitable and suitable for all parties.
3821 2018-07-08 22:41:30 Girl I feel you I’m oily AF lol. I’ve been using Cover FX mattifying primer, and their mattifying setting spray too. I use Laura Mercier silk creme oil free foundation and I really love it. I heard Estée Lauder double wear foundation is good too!
3822 2018-07-08 22:41:28 It's quite obvious the Skripal poisoning and latest follow-up poisoning were the work of UK intelligence to get rid of Putin so UK/US can control Russian resources and stop oil trading in the petro-yuan.
3823 2018-07-08 22:40:46 Coba pake bio oil nderr
3824 2018-07-08 22:40:45 I just feel like rubbing some oil and shea butter through a full beard. That’s my mood.
3825 2018-07-08 22:40:42 In 1990, when Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait took one-tenth of the global oil supply off the market, raising prices. The Mexican government then accurately predicted that the high oil prices wouldn’t last, betting on a decline w/ PUT options.
3826 2018-07-08 22:40:33 And I'm never gonna do it again because to hell with Oil Ocean and Metropolis zones. I hate those levels.
3827 2018-07-08 22:40:30 That boy brow and cloud paint is NOT a scam and my sunshine tint oil keeps me MOISTURIZED

3829 2018-07-08 22:40:21 So get ready for oil drilling in the Grand Canyon, trees cut down in the redwood national forest, land cleared at Yellowstone for condos and hotels. Protected animals no longer protected, our nations beauty destroyed for money.
3830 2018-07-08 22:40:12 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
3831 2018-07-08 22:40:00 @realDonaldTrump says climate change is fake and we need to allow businesses to earn more for the economy to grow, but the people say no to pollution so now the gas and oil companies want to fight this initiative in Washington State!
Interesting story!
3832 2018-07-08 22:39:56 I’m slathered I’m coconut oil and I feel like Gene when he takes a bean bath and wants people to chase bean boy around
3833 2018-07-08 22:39:26 One thing I definitely do not kiss about twitter, all of the super cringey accounts that are always acting like they're slick as oil when trying to slide into my dms. =_= Like, no. Ew.
3834 2018-07-08 22:39:16 I think those numbers are inflated or reflect spending in some parts of the Country only. With oil boom out here spending is high. I’m not convinced it’s an accurate representation.
3835 2018-07-08 22:39:13 Sara tell ur friend that tell him my oil has finished i’m not able to bema nama   
3836 2018-07-08 22:39:12 Wappen your waist need oil?

3838 2018-07-08 22:39:03 Please oh PLEASE use coal for this beauty, I’m always sad when I learn that an engine has been converted to oil.
3839 2018-07-08 22:38:47 Watching @ABarber904 play with nerf guns after changing his oil.... a kid in an adult’s body ... 
3840 2018-07-08 22:38:42 Mexico buys put options from investment banks and typically hedges a whopping 200-300 million barrels of oil a year. With the put options, it has the right, but not the obligation, to sell oil at a previously set price and timing.
3841 2018-07-08 22:38:36 Nightly, but I have recurrent periodontitis and it hurts like a mofo if i let it get out of hand. Brush, floss, rinse every night.  In the morning I trade out oil pulling before brushing, then rinse.

3844 2018-07-08 22:38:04 @TomSteyer Mother Nature set off killawaya the day you took money from big oil. You just ignore that FACT So I ask once more ! What do you know of Mother Nature ? I'm the only man to get her between the sheets and live 
3845 2018-07-08 22:37:56 got an oil change. let the bender begin
3846 2018-07-08 22:37:47 Microwaved 4 min in a ceramic bowl covered with a plate then toasted them in a frypan with salt & olive oil. Parsley goes in very last after heat is turned off.

3848 2018-07-08 22:37:37 No, we don’t “get it”.  I still can’t figure out how a modern snake oil salesman conned so many people.  I thought Americans were smarter than that.
3849 2018-07-08 22:37:13 The only one whose hair looks clean and healthy is freaking Echo!!! Raven's hair looks like she hasn't washed it in months. Oil slick!! And Lindsey has beautiful hair!
3850 2018-07-08 22:37:03 It’s not like you used the best oil or anything right?
3851 2018-07-08 22:36:50 you ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil
3852 2018-07-08 22:36:31 The supreme Court should be reading the Constitution as it was written not as the progressive left wishes it was laws need to met constitutional muster not the Constitution reinterpretated to fit the law. I'm pro drilling offshore and the artic we need oil net neutrality is
3853 2018-07-08 22:36:23 I don’t think anybody has told you that the oil in the North Sea isn’t viable to extract and refine thus the large redundancy’s in the oil industry so no bonus there buddy.
3854 2018-07-08 22:36:22 Without a doubt Hussein was a psychopath but if there was no oil underneath Iraq, Kuwait or Iran the US would never have bothered. Your English is just fine.
3855 2018-07-08 22:36:11 How many Fox News employees has trump hired?
3856 2018-07-08 22:36:05 You certainly didn't have to ask if it was Portlandia OR Maine. That awareness alone deems you worthy of notification! ;-)
3857 2018-07-08 22:36:04 1/I mean, LCHF should be as valid an option as the curent 50-60-% carbs. Left to me we would get rid of procesed food at all, but that ain't gonna happen.  I would prefer all foods to at least have a " natural " start ie butter lard not industrial seed oil.

3860 2018-07-08 22:35:53 @ChefStellino hi Chef Nick, I have dear friends who are sharing family olive oil from Crete, besides salad maybe on roasted vegetables what else can I use it with? Grazie!
3861 2018-07-08 22:35:50 I thought ur favorite part was explaining to taxpayers how you LIED and conned them about voter fraud. I’m sure explaining your Contempt of court fines is right up there too! #HonorMatters even in Kansas. Selling snake oil!

3863 2018-07-08 22:35:24 Post the oil wars, water world wars are coming. Inland due to drought like conditions in almost all countries. And on the oceans, due to protectionism, trade wars and route domination. Hopefully innovators get there first and solve the former. Latter more complex.
3864 2018-07-08 22:35:20 Only half my sub had oil and vinegar 
3865 2018-07-08 22:35:10 It’s awesome! You gotta have it with fresh lemon juice and olive oil! Oh and sprinkle sea salt on the top!
3866 2018-07-08 22:35:08 To be fair using the actual money instead of heating oil is about as efficient as the way it is spent here.
3867 2018-07-08 22:34:56 Now ur cooking w peanut oil
3868 2018-07-08 22:34:54 Hello mr dumb, doing anything to tackle oil price.
3869 2018-07-08 22:34:40 Therefore. Catholicism and Islam are both the “gold standard” of religions.  Sheer capitalism and oil money allow for the best most exclusive collections of art and real estate
3870 2018-07-08 22:34:30 Its about oil.
3871 2018-07-08 22:34:27 With Venezuela, it has systemic problems which don't help, but it's problem has been massive spending on a (wasteful) social programme with the rest expectation that they'll "pay for it" using oil revenue - then the price of oil collapsed.
3872 2018-07-08 22:34:18 I'll tell you, the ND thing I felt bad for. Met folks that lived there prior, and when the oil boom happened on the folks with money moved in, rents skyrocketed and priced the poor locals out.
3873 2018-07-08 22:34:16 Do you oil ur beard
3874 2018-07-08 22:34:09 Because it's all about land locking Alberta oil and forcing them to sell to only the USA at huge discounts.  Nor do we hear about the barges of jet fuel that will be heading to Richmond or anything about the possible LNG terminal in northern BC #bcpoli
3875 2018-07-08 22:34:03 Some argan oil would be good

3879 2018-07-08 22:32:48  i went to that five min oil change place it ended up being 60 dollars 
3880 2018-07-08 22:32:31 The discussion that @POTUS had with the Saudis really worked. Gas in my town just went up 50 cents a gal. Thank you big oil for sharing all that money in taxes the @realDonaldTrump saved you and don't forget the deregs.
3881 2018-07-08 22:32:23 Where are all those aunties that would ignore your greeting and go and tell your mother you passed them without greeting them? Hope they all have oil blocks now 
3882 2018-07-08 22:32:09 just start chugging olive oil
3883 2018-07-08 22:31:43 Today I got drinks, food, face masques, hair masques, and vitamin E oil. I’m thriving. 
3884 2018-07-08 22:31:36 Hahaha!! Is he still "recycling" full bottles of olive oil etc??  Sorry, I know I shouldn't laugh! Greg just started 2 weeks' holiday, so I have it all ahead of me!  xxx

3889 2018-07-08 22:30:47 People are sick of feeling sick. They get better cutting "entries good groups" if those are grain, sugar, oil, sometimes dairy. Very nutritious diets exist with zero of those foods, so why cry about their choices?

3899 2018-07-08 22:29:09 I think I could have done it in my 20s, but my hair seems more fragile now. When I had that blue chunk in it the other year, I used to just pour the coconut oil on it so it wouldn’t dry out.
3900 2018-07-08 22:28:48 Delicious with a must need for oil.....and toys

3905 2018-07-08 22:28:00 #Zueitina and #Hariga are ports controlled by the Libyan National Army and they hust stopped pumping oil (loading onto seaborn tankers for delivery to world markets). The divide in Libya between East and West is deepening.
3906 2018-07-08 22:27:57 thanks for the RT Nic. I appreciate it & will never short oil on Friday LOL :)

3908 2018-07-08 22:27:16 Kapler is a strange bird,  I like my mangers who smell like Old Spice & Red Man not posing oil and Paco Rabanne.
3909 2018-07-08 22:27:11 1/yup not surprised.  hence my submission to the Australian obesity commission, though veg oil consumption also drives appetite & thus inc carbs as well. ( cant see the australian one though
3910 2018-07-08 22:27:08 What’s the name of that oil tanker? Can I track it to the South Pole?
3911 2018-07-08 22:26:30 C-P-C has increased gasoline and diesel prices at the pump from this morning following a hike in international crude oil prices.
3912 2018-07-08 22:26:20 Oil and aiding Putin is probably the reason Trump floated the idea of invading Venezuela.
3913 2018-07-08 22:26:10 Wouldn't want folks home to worry about the oil..
3914 2018-07-08 22:25:35 Better still let’s step away from oil instead

3918 2018-07-08 22:25:09 What oiler and oil did you use?  I've been having the same issues on my MK3 with the Metallics and would love a solution that worked on an MK3 already.  I thought I was going crazy and the only person to have trouble with ProtoPasta.
3919 2018-07-08 22:24:57 If you promise to frac all the things and a pumpjack in every back yard, you'll have my vote, sir!
3920 2018-07-08 22:24:44 Detoxifying? What did you drink crude oil or something...what toxins? It's just tea....nice kimono though...
3921 2018-07-08 22:24:40 Funny - my pastor made a very off-the-cuff remark 10 years ago about how secrets become declassified many years later. The very thing he said was (and again, said in jest) that we may discover that Australia was in East Timor for the gas and the oil rather than for their freedom

3932 2018-07-08 22:23:36 As a society we need to use hemp plastic vs. oil based plastics. Hemp is both biodegradable & non toxic... but what do I know 
3933 2018-07-08 22:23:34 Libya’s National Oil Corporation has declared "force majeure" on crude oil loadings from two oil terminals, which effectively just removed -850,000 bpd from production.
3934 2018-07-08 22:23:14 Easy to find all this info about oil extraction costs and revenue rises from oil - if you want to. Also easy to ignore if it doesn't support your case; because none of it is reported in the MSM. Oil & Gas industry news is full of this kind of stuff; obviously.
3935 2018-07-08 22:23:02 Ah, my soros check didnt arrive so I had no money for used french fry oil to run my converted subaru to the battlefield.  Dang nabit
3936 2018-07-08 22:22:57 I used to put damp towels in fridge then hang them over front of fan. Now I have 2 misting fans that I had a little peppermint oil to (the menthol helps trick the brain into believing it’s colder); works a treat. But peppermint oil in water sprayed onto fan blades works too.
3937 2018-07-08 22:22:23 well I am not sure how long you have been involved with economics. But I know for a fact that Obama did those things. It was the entire way he structured all of the deals for foreign aid, for Obama care for the deals on oil he made. If businesses can't compete in our economy.

3941 2018-07-08 22:22:03 Oh good I suppose you're also against the oil lobby, the pharmaceutical lobby, agribusiness, etc since we give those industries such sizable tax breaks. Wow we agree for once.
3942 2018-07-08 22:22:01 If only China had implemented this 'green sword' policy when oil & gas prices were high & recycled polymer cheaper than virgin material.

Fuel efficiency gasoline vehicles ca 20%

Electrical Vehicles convert ca 60 % of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. If the electricity on the grid is produced from oil or coal, fuel efficiency for electrical generators is around 33%
60 % * 33 % = 20%

3987 2018-07-08 22:15:06 Anyone ever realize that ever since the War On Oil- my bad the "War On Terror" started there have been MORE terrorist attacks on U.S. soil......it's like invading other countries that MIGHT have extremists and interfering with their elections might anger the populous

Who knew?
3988 2018-07-08 22:15:02 thats good, however, of real concern is , seed oil consumption went up 1,000 fold int he last century its more closely correlated with the  current crisis than anything else . It got put in to replace sat fat alongside sugar, that last thing we need is even more seed oils.
3989 2018-07-08 22:15:00 ホントそれw
一言ごとに感情が爆発しててあんまり理不尽だと会話終わっても呆然としちゃう
3990 2018-07-08 22:14:59 If Fat Olives pizza had any more oil, I could deep fry an egg roll.
3991 2018-07-08 22:14:43  they found the oil how tf sheesh
3992 2018-07-08 22:14:38 Send me with them if you're going to do that. Or at least deport me to Spain or somewhere gorgeous and fun like that
3993 2018-07-08 22:14:32 Switch to electric cars. Don't have to deal with oil then. Less money to Saudi and Iran, cleaner air, where's the down side?

3996 2018-07-08 22:14:27 Ay boy you don't need no more of that oil boy, that's another lick for you boy.
3997 2018-07-08 22:14:24 I put some salmon oil in Hayley’s dinner because she deserves it! She’s such a good cat.
3998 2018-07-08 22:14:20 Donald don’t keep us in suspense, you tease! I don’t know if I’ll be able to sleep tonight. Hint? Will it be male or female? While you’re at it, will your daughter be announcing a new fansion line? You’re such a snake oil salesman.
3999 2018-07-08 22:14:19 What kind of oil? Is beard oil a thing?
4000 2018-07-08 22:14:16 Wasting time You still love Russia too much to do something. Until Europe cuts its links with Russian oil and natural gas, nothing will happen. Money is more important to you than democracy.
4001 2018-07-08 22:14:14 Not a chance. Putin's destruction of American democracy is not complete and sanctions have yet to be lifted by tRump. (Putin's wish)

Also, @POTUS has not yet earned the 19% of the untapped Rosneft oil reserves. (@realDonaldTrump's wish)
 But it's still fun to have hope.
4002 2018-07-08 22:14:08 This the tastiest oil pen i have ever had god damn
4003 2018-07-08 22:14:01 We’re Drowning in Seas of Plastic
The fossil fuel era must end, or it will spell humanity's end. Rapid, exploitation of these valuable resources has also led to a world choked in plastic= plastics are made from fossil fuels, often by the same companies that produce oil and gas.

4006 2018-07-08 22:13:24 Look them right in the eyes & say: You knew about the pollution too.
As big oil we know that you burned your share, so pay your part of the price.....
4007 2018-07-08 22:13:16 There are real issues facing the world.

4011 2018-07-08 22:12:51 Can’t wait to be able to rob banks after my finger print changes from the repeated soaking of my fingers in doughnut frying oil
4012 2018-07-08 22:12:28 Liberals only read two types of books:  YA books about all-guuurl Chosen Ones who save the world, or unoriginal character studies about depressed people with drug problems.
4013 2018-07-08 22:12:17 He got blue cheese and oil the shit looked like it could feed 5 people
4014 2018-07-08 22:12:17 That will probably change when they start more sanctions. It also doesn't seem to benefit Saudi Arabia or Russia to increase oil production if they can keep the prices higher.
4015 2018-07-08 22:12:17 What about people that drive around with their high beams on? Can you take care of them?
4016 2018-07-08 22:12:05 Check out a game called Oil. Pretty simple, but well-made and fun to play.
4017 2018-07-08 22:12:05 You forgot nuke Cali, Seattle and most of Manhattan.
4018 2018-07-08 22:12:03 In a similar theme, the global warming Narrative of 2005-2008, was largely about the up coming "Peak Oil" for many countries and their search for energy independence. Even China & India are not immune to their "Peak Oil" and oil price shocks. [like UK in 2000, net importer 2007]

4024 2018-07-08 22:10:49 1)Will get a pledge from Putin ‘to do something’  if Mueller finds  % Proof Of Conspiracy against USA?

2)Intensive election rigging in 2018 & 2020 for GOP?

3)Safe defection to Russia?

4)Future real estate/oil & gas deals?

6)None of the above

7)Only Has Pure USA Interest
4025 2018-07-08 22:10:46 The media are angry,why? There is no more free money from the government.

- The Ex generals are murmuring, Why? There is no sign President Buhari will renew their oil blocks contract.

- Social cultural groups are grumbling, Why? No more Ghana must go bags of money to support

4029 2018-07-08 22:10:25 He lost the “people’s vote” by millions. He won the “electoral vote” because of foreign interference during the campaign & the backing of many oil + coal billionaires (+ Wall Street bankers) hoping to profit from his policies to help the rich get richer. He fooled regular folk...
4030 2018-07-08 22:10:23 Reagan was too liberal for the GOP in 1976, the convention was chaotic with all of his "ideas" while the GOP was holding onto oil taxes to limit demand and wage and price controls for any industry that went openly anti-consumer.  Today it's no taxes and helping screw consumers.
4031 2018-07-08 22:10:22 それだとお互いどちらか選ぶってなりそうですねw

4032 2018-07-08 22:10:18 I'd not heard that about coconut.
As with most things, it sometimes depends on where & how produced.  

I saw an article that said  stopping palm oil production would lead to worse habitat loss to grow alternatives. Suggested stopping further growth & push for sustainable.

4034 2018-07-08 22:10:05 Jeremy Corbyn is just a snake oil salesman.

He is on video as saying to a group of muslims “you have strength in unity” and to a non muslim group, “diversity is your strength”.

He will say, and promise anything if it garners him votes.

Duties will be imposed on some U.S. goods, which are produced in Russia cover some types of road construction equipment, oil and gas equipment, metalworking machines, rock drilling equipment, optical fiber
4039 2018-07-08 22:09:01 National interest and Mann ki baat, whenever we get international situation pressurizing Indian Goverenment, the PM should immediately connect with Janta, for 70 years we appeal to vote, but can't involve, masses to reduce oil consumption by sharing travel, alternate meanings.

4041 2018-07-08 22:08:22 Masturbating keep you from earning extra miles until ya next oil change
4042 2018-07-08 22:08:19 When Ralph was holding the reins he had no debt levels like we have today. The NDP regardless if oil was at 95 a barrel would still be in debt up to 50 billion since they can not fathom reduced size of government.
4043 2018-07-08 22:08:18 Vinegar is next to the cooking oil..... Same colour, obviously! 
4044 2018-07-08 22:08:16 Oil changed on my four wheel box...this Sunday couldn’t be going any better.

4045 2018-07-08 22:08:11 cant use oil either, just pure skill. forget grill marks
4046 2018-07-08 22:07:58 Pros of heat waves in LA: coconut oil stays melted which cuts down your cooking time by a whole 10 seconds
4047 2018-07-08 22:07:56 I am not saying that oil must be abandoned altogether, but we should look for alternatives to use as little as possible. I'm 49, I think I will not suffer too much by my death but I think that those who follow will not find it funny.
4048 2018-07-08 22:07:44 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

4052 2018-07-08 22:07:28 Might be 30 more minutes. Went to go pick up my car for it’s oil change and it’s still not ready.

4054 2018-07-08 22:07:13 Meet #Alrosa CEO Ivanov, son of a Vladimir Putin's advisor in administration or like that. So, did we invest money in Brexit? Russian fields are so rich with oil, gas, jewels...
4055 2018-07-08 22:06:38 You want to allow oil drilling and allow corporations to exploit public lands to pay for this bill. That is a hard NO. It will poison water and destroy wildlife. How about using that $25 BILLION  wall money? Keep your grimy hands off public lands. #lyingrob #VoteRepublicansOut
4056 2018-07-08 22:06:36 Okay...here’s the breakout. Using olive oil, butter and @PERFECTBITEBBQ Cajun Q rub on the blackening.
4057 2018-07-08 22:06:26 I took my car to Walmart when i got my oil changed and they talkin bout ur tire can’t be fixed I’m like whats wrong with it the girl say she don’t know they aint say ....what
4058 2018-07-08 22:05:58 The TRUTH....so British Govt and their jihadists can steal oil and gas from Hebrew Biafra the origin of most African Americans. AMALGAMATION of Nigeria by the British govt 1914 to 2014 expired. REFERENDUM SOLVES THE PROBLEM. Lookup Eri kingdom son of GAD.
4059 2018-07-08 22:05:49 What a disaster it has been. Children in cages, high oil and gas prices, Scott Pruitt, so many lies and a president that doesn’t care about others, just himself.
4060 2018-07-08 22:05:47 I ended up drinking garri oh, who has time to crack egg, whisk it, slice vegetables, on gas, pour oil, fry egg, dish it, boil water make tea, then sit down an eat? I mean who has that time?
4061 2018-07-08 22:05:34 I just slathered my body including my face in almond oil and now I’m laying on my bed but can’t rest my face on my hand cos it keeps sliding off. Man the things we take for granted.
4062 2018-07-08 22:05:33 Folic acid for methotrexate, vitamin d and fish oil.
4063 2018-07-08 22:05:26 Honestly I’ll get so overwhelmed I might cry the whole time hahaha! Yeah I seen that, because of palm oil. I love that they’ve taken a stand, hopefully other places will follow suit!
4064 2018-07-08 22:04:53 BS. Tax the rich to pay for it.  Clean energy only!  Don’t try to pull this on Ohio.  No one wants polluters to supply our energy. (Except for you, of course.) Big bucks to your from oil and gas lobbyists.
4065 2018-07-08 22:04:48 I find a little handful like that to spice the oil is fine, but the same amount needed chopped up at the end thrown in raw for taste.
4066 2018-07-08 22:04:47 face pr itna oil koi lanat bhi dy wo bhi slip ho jati...
4067 2018-07-08 22:04:43 Yeah, but there's an oil painting in his attic where he looks like CRAP.
4068 2018-07-08 22:04:39 Here is a scenario oil is about to be blown up the guys getting into the Escape pod jumping into the ocean automatic release into the ocean easy to recover them afterwards

4071 2018-07-08 22:04:20 That's not how you drill for oil...
4072 2018-07-08 22:04:17 Totally bizaire behavior for Ex-head of KGB & newly created FSB+ RT Media?
Putins many motives:
1) Lift sanctions for invading Ukraine 
2) Left alone to continue expanding lost Russian territory. 
3) Destabalize Western Democracies
4) Weaken NATO
5) Exon Mobil Oil Deal revived.
4073 2018-07-08 22:04:10 itna oil saudia me nh hona jtna mre face or hairs m hai...
4074 2018-07-08 22:03:54 The US still imports oil hence why prices are rising

There were never death panels. Ever. 

2000 dollars over 12 months is 166 bucks a month for a family of 4. That’s $41 per member a month. 

Businesses were making RECORD profits before tax cut.
4075 2018-07-08 22:03:54 Came to a cookout with the Bruhz and told them I liked the Alphas and they was finna get me outta here. 

Snatched my cup of oil and my plate.
4076 2018-07-08 22:03:48 You know what that cabinet is a cesspool people are  leaving left and right it’s so dysfunctional running 
Like a well oil machine huh
4077 2018-07-08 22:03:35 Strangely, the common link between all of those GOP Senators is the Keystone Pipeline, that would run through their states or their states would receive profit from the movement and refinement of the transported 'oil.'
4078 2018-07-08 22:03:08 Pretty girl privilege is when you go in for an oil change and they fix your broken bumper, inflate your tires, and give your car a wash all for free 
4079 2018-07-08 22:02:11 i beat myself up for not stanning or going to shows like come on girl what was wrong wit u like i passed soldier field and lucas oil and cried bc i knew they performed there and i didn’t go
4080 2018-07-08 22:02:09 Being drunk and trying to sleep on your stomach is like mixing oil with water.
4081 2018-07-08 22:01:49 Oil is a commodity set and traded on the exchange.
4082 2018-07-08 22:01:36 Bought oil controlling face wash... pls control my face

4084 2018-07-08 22:01:24 Give your hair a break from shampooing everyday and use a treatment oil every so often.
4085 2018-07-08 22:01:21 Trump is rebuilding the military reducing the trade deficit eliminating the need for foreign oil. How is that betraying anything.

4098 2018-07-08 21:59:45 I'm not trying to be negative at all. I just think six laps for debris was a little much. I could understand if they had a wrecked car to remove or oil to cleanup!
4099 2018-07-08 21:59:32 rt if ya know someone who sells oil im tryna buy
4100 2018-07-08 21:59:19 While at work Matthew came and got my keys to take my car to get cleaned inside and out and oil changed  I don’t deserve him 
4101 2018-07-08 21:59:10 best product to use for tanning? (other than a regular lotion or oil) I usually use baby oil, but I was wondering if anything else works better!
4102 2018-07-08 21:58:53 (Will also need to find something new to put the bottles of oil and vinegar and various seasonings on because I tossed that box lid in the trash and they can’t stand independently)
4103 2018-07-08 21:58:52 @lucyismycat hey there sorry it's been a wild day in the oil patch!!  I had a guy get injured on a rig and had to rush out there and check on him and call someone to come replace him!!  He broke his arm!!  It's always busy in my job lol!!! Hope to hear back from you!!
4104 2018-07-08 21:58:48 That's the power grid. The website I quoted is talking about the industry, not the grid. We're talking all the way from upstream drilling oil, to gas stations.
4105 2018-07-08 21:58:31 For the first time in decades the agenda of left being not just stalled but dismantled/ rolled back. 
Something R's never do. Back in power again,  left picks up where they left off.
This is what they really hate, actually losing ground on prior gains. #MAGA
4106 2018-07-08 21:58:25 A coal mine in every backyard, and an oil rig in every front yard. Praise White Republican Jesus
4107 2018-07-08 21:57:46 Exactly! When I was in school our Dept. Chair told us his modest salary so we had accurate expectations of what we might earn, even with a PhD. 80K in the Bay Area is poverty level in some cities. Nobody becomes a geologist to get rich, unless you plan to work for big oil.
4108 2018-07-08 21:57:35 “time to burn the midnight oil haha” i say as i clock into my 5 hour shift at 3:00 in the afternoon
4109 2018-07-08 21:57:35 Oil money. Keystone pipeline is the common link between all of the senators that went to Russia for Independence Day.
4110 2018-07-08 21:57:13 Games like them against Kilkenny and coming out on top is better than Drinking COD LIVER OIL!
4111 2018-07-08 21:56:57 Difference is: Syria called russia to help them, USA invited itself when successfully starting a rebellion (FSA) against syria and its people.
+ sponsoring ISIS and other terror organisations. Russia doesn't claim oil nor gas since it was called for help.
4112 2018-07-08 21:56:52 Nope on the resources, Fed never helped alberta,Sask  a drop for our oil NG, and coal.we own our oil gas and coal and its infrastructure, sorry can’t budge.Your other ideas are pretty good though.still waiting for Quebec to payback alberta for 11billion we loaned for JB Hydro Prj

4115 2018-07-08 21:56:28 Lol, Jimmy Kimmel writer in the house. Putin is an evil SOB and Russia needs to be sanctioned heavily by the US AND THE EU. Germany's response? Build a massive pipeline to import RUSSIAN oil. The hypocrisy is just too rich.
4116 2018-07-08 21:56:24 I think you would need a Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion for that group 
4117 2018-07-08 21:56:21 Slather me in oil like a monkey.
4118 2018-07-08 21:56:13 It is! Coconut oil is magic, you can literally find it anywhere. I get mine at wal mart lol
4119 2018-07-08 21:55:57 My biggest pet peeve is when someone has their child out with their hair a mess all dried up and shit if y’all don’t put some oil or sum in that mf hair. Including my niece I go in on my sister every day. Y’all doing my babies bad
4120 2018-07-08 21:55:34 How hot is it in the house? The coconut oil never lies. (Solid = You’re fine; stop complaining. Liquid = Help!!!)  #heatwave
4121 2018-07-08 21:55:33 So why are gas prices at levels of 2008 and oil is half the price.. Do you think we are being gouged? Good for the tax man higher the price higher the tax load.. Suck it up taxpayers.. Or bitch to your local mla..
4122 2018-07-08 21:55:33 I think you will find that a national debt not just England’s, but how convenient to your argument, as it stands right now Scotland economically would not meet EU requirements for re joining the EU. Deficit of 9% including NS oil to England 2% , be real ..
4123 2018-07-08 21:55:32 Palm oil , electronics equipment etc should get high import levies  let them enjoy the company of our criminals.
4124 2018-07-08 21:55:31 Perfect timing! My 11yo daughter is suddenly an oil slick...taking after mom and big sis. Gotta love genes! Can't wait to try it out, and thanks so much for sharing! 
4125 2018-07-08 21:55:09 Because other countries depend on it and the crude prices are set based on production and the international oil cartel, its called leadership
4126 2018-07-08 21:55:06 @nate4stall @steveODeee
4127 2018-07-08 21:55:02 Not sure why you say that.

 If removing subsidies causes such collapse, imagine if oil goes to $100 from where it is now, then $200, then $300 as calls are now being for that price as .... normal.
4128 2018-07-08 21:54:55 ah, this must be the extra virgin olive oil I ordered

4131 2018-07-08 21:54:20 1) the “average family” doesn’t earn 70,000 a year

2) there is no death panel

3) trump didn’t make US energy independent - in fact he’s tweeting threats to OPEC demanding they export more oil... meaning he’s hurting those who make money working in the oil patch.
4132 2018-07-08 21:54:11 Someone gotta write a thinkpiece about braam boy culture and how they're continuously pressured to keep up with strenuous fashion demands. I can't do it though because I don't own enough coconut oil to have my own blog.

4134 2018-07-08 21:53:42 Why are oil prices so High?  Your Iran policy?
4135 2018-07-08 21:53:37 Most can’t read Trump is a snake oil dealer for the illiterate a tv evangelical that uses guilt for the poor to send money A car salesman with white shoes belt and leisure suit A true con man from the fifties

4139 2018-07-08 21:52:46 I wonder if CBD oil would do the same for you?

4141 2018-07-08 21:52:35 STOP KILLING BABIES FOR BABY OIL!
4142 2018-07-08 21:52:32 Cheers sir! No doubt he'll come back and say it was pure luck. I've had "snake oil" and "darts" from him so far this week :)
4143 2018-07-08 21:52:31 my mom is discovering cbd oil this could be THE game changer
4144 2018-07-08 21:52:30 Does he have stock in any other oil company? Follow the money!
4145 2018-07-08 21:52:23 drink lots of water, i like mine with lemon. dial soap with coconut, shea moisture hydrating face mask, tea tree oil.
4146 2018-07-08 21:52:00 If you’re out golfing this Sunday, be sure to thank oil and natural gas for the golf balls you are playing with! ‍

4148 2018-07-08 21:51:48 Your god is literally Gold Oil and Drugs
4149 2018-07-08 21:51:38 All my balms are now oil soup 
4150 2018-07-08 21:51:38 I'm sure they will do fine. Problem will be that the US wouldn't have anything to say about Iranian oil and gas! You know? The American God (Gold, Oil, Dollars)! That is the only reason why America is desatabilizing Middle East for deccades now. What do you know? Ever been in ME?
4151 2018-07-08 21:51:29 Fake news there is no oil shortage. A Hedge fund mgr told me, the world could own 5 Cadillac SUV per family and we would never have a shortage, it’s all manipulated. If we cut back, there is a glut. It’s a game. Once the globalist are in prison, it will all stabilizes. Soon!
4152 2018-07-08 21:51:19 Just Go comr.
4153 2018-07-08 21:51:13 Changing your own oil is not worth it
4154 2018-07-08 21:51:10 Aloe Vera and vitamin e oil are absolute must haves for your skin care regime. 
4155 2018-07-08 21:51:05 Dude the earth is flat man and lead gas was not dangerous the oil companies told us it was perfectly safe! They should bring it back! And, they told us global warming is totally fake man!! :) Miami and Venice are don’t no fine they are not under water!
4156 2018-07-08 21:50:46 Very nice, I can almost smell the oil 
4157 2018-07-08 21:50:41 In a robot World ravaged by rust, one young Robo boy stands to help out all those in need with his trusty oil can and wire brush by his side. Along the way he'll meet many friends as he continues his amazing adventure to save his grandfather from the rust King.
4158 2018-07-08 21:50:35 yeah. You either get used to it, find the right shampoo/conditioner/oil or shave it.
4159 2018-07-08 21:50:15 @cbdoil11  Where can I get CDB oil that's affordable?
4160 2018-07-08 21:50:14 Why The Coming Oil Crunch Will Shock The World..??
4161 2018-07-08 21:50:06 so I stared oil pulling my teeth today and I’m curious to know if others who have tried it have seen a result n if it’s worth the icky swishing!
4162 2018-07-08 21:49:15 All I need is my tea tree oil face wash, glycolic acid face wash, witch hazel, and an unscented moisturizer.

4165 2018-07-08 21:49:02 Canada's oil makes sense to most countries, it's cheaper and the perfect product for road surfaces, numerous roofing materials etc. Those countries do not want to use a premium product for those applications. So yes our product is in huge demand.
4166 2018-07-08 21:48:58 I love it “Don the Con”. @realDonaldTrump you can sell your snake oil elsewhere.  Oh yea North Korean is no longer buying it.
4167 2018-07-08 21:48:53 Why not have free trade if it means people get cheaper groceries was their line - to hell with quality - and to hell with Scottish food and drink industry which is more valuable than our oil and gas!
4168 2018-07-08 21:48:52 Yeah, I could definitely use one of those. Oil change, that is. If I had strip club money I’d spend it on records, instead!
4169 2018-07-08 21:48:47 Haven't used it with roses, but some neem oil is a great all-around repellant and fungicide. Bummer.
4170 2018-07-08 21:48:37 I'm from a small town in Texas and I thought that tattoo was an oil rig...
4171 2018-07-08 21:48:34 black castor oil my love. rub it in every night
4172 2018-07-08 21:48:17 Stomp, Yell and a bunch of protesting and/or rioting even though it won’t change anything...you know the same stuff they’ve been doing for a year and a half 

4173 2018-07-08 21:48:13 Well it’s nothing to do with vast oil reserves because those are worthless
4174 2018-07-08 21:47:17 North side, FTW
4175 2018-07-08 21:47:12 Why is a snake oil salesman and peddler of historical fiction an NRO contributor? How can you decry a fraudulent conservative organization while working for one that employs fraudulent conservative contributors?
4176 2018-07-08 21:47:06 The human head weighs eight pounds on average. My shoes are black. My car needs an oil change.

This is fun!
4177 2018-07-08 21:47:01 Not convinced the oil is rebranded 
4178 2018-07-08 21:46:39 And ?  What ?  Yes, you break a good deal with Iran & now they’ve found new ways to harass YOU. Oil prices ?  Nuclear build up ?  Don’t get all smug ‘cause they’re not harassing our ships #MangoMonster The American people will pay for your bully tactics & doing Putin’s bidding.
4179 2018-07-08 21:46:05 me, furiously buying biotin vitamins & castor oil: i need chest-length hair STAT
4180 2018-07-08 21:45:49 I’ve recently started using CBD oil for my MS symptoms and I’ve gotta say it has greatly reduced my nerve pain 
4181 2018-07-08 21:45:21 Little urn looks like it once poured oil? Looks like it had a little handle on one side. Great finds 
4182 2018-07-08 21:45:18 big hooters, big oil, big toe
4183 2018-07-08 21:45:13 oil is key to locking in moisture or some kind of heavy cream!
4184 2018-07-08 21:44:56 Why would machines need to eat? Am I missing something? Maybe they might rob a petrol station  or mechanics workshop for oil? 
4185 2018-07-08 21:44:53 Makes sense. So does drinking motor oil to lubricate our joints.
4186 2018-07-08 21:44:50 And Trump is determined to blow up the economy!!  The gutting of ACA, the increase in oil prices, and the trade wars are inflicting pain on Americans.
4187 2018-07-08 21:44:27 Before sex I like to rub my woman and myself down with coconut oil and Shea Butter....is that weird?
4188 2018-07-08 21:44:22 He looks a little scared!
4189 2018-07-08 21:44:04 So what you’re saying is, you’re worried about upsetting your Russian & Muslim friends who make billions off coal & oil every day?

You really don’t care if your great great grandchildren suffocate from too much Co2, because, screw them.
Thanks grandpa.

pre-sear (hot pan, ~4 mins each side) 
skip trivet
use 1/4 - 1/2 cup beef broth & go lighter on the salt. maybe quarter an onion, too
you can drain oil/juice as you shred but save it; once it’s out it can’t go back in, but you can use it as dip/sauce.
4194 2018-07-08 21:43:39 I’m with you! My husband died 11/12010, due to complications from burning oil fields in Iraq, 11 months after retiring from 35 years service to his country. When he mocked McCain and Gold Star families I felt the pain. I will protest until my bones are dust!!
4195 2018-07-08 21:43:33 استغفرالله
4196 2018-07-08 21:43:02 Yes! Give it a try. I also use it for oil treatment scalp massages.
4197 2018-07-08 21:43:00 Who got oil cartridge deals! I neeeedd
4198 2018-07-08 21:42:55 Threatening to block oil shipments via Strait of Hormuz if accommodations refused on Iran deal. Should get permission to drill canal/tunnel thru UAE and Oman. But trade war with China liable to switch currency to Yuan--several BRICS nations.
4199 2018-07-08 21:42:33 I totally agree but there are no hero's or Nazis in this story.
4200 2018-07-08 21:42:10 I was too generous with kraft. He likely prefers cheap off brand slices with extra hydrogenated oil and therefore felt right at home with whatever passes for cheese in DPRK.
4201 2018-07-08 21:42:04 Oil change car wash beautiful ass weather for a road trip... ain’t going nowhere tho lol
4202 2018-07-08 21:42:03 The President should slash Regulations, start producing our own oil.
4203 2018-07-08 21:41:46 had to learn oil painting in my junior year of hs so i started making a chart for reference and never finished

4210 2018-07-08 21:40:59 I've also been told that I look much younger than my actual age. I usually just attribute it to all that gay sex...and Oil of Olay, of course.
4211 2018-07-08 21:40:58 Ok, let me put it this way. People were at work doing their jobs so things and places can still function. 
Yes, some jobs require you to be there 16 hrs which leave you your 8 hrs to sleep. Fire fighters are 24-48 on and 2-3 days on call. Oil rig, your on there weeks at a time.
4212 2018-07-08 21:40:52 I think if you wash your face too much, your body starts to overproduce oil and you’ll break out more. The irony :/
4213 2018-07-08 21:40:33 Did you have an opportunity to confront the Police officer in charge?
4214 2018-07-08 21:40:30  i’ve done everything but castor oil ... I don’t want to throw up

4220 2018-07-08 21:39:45 No they actually went down when that happened they went over $3 a gallon under Obama. The price of crude oil skyrocketed under Obama. Where are you getting your Intel. Are you listening to college professors. I don't mean that in a despraging way. I'm genuinely curious.
4221 2018-07-08 21:39:43 You're no oil painting
4222 2018-07-08 21:39:31 independent research states that once the 45th president opens his mouth, Mitch Mcconnell writes a song about #love
4223 2018-07-08 21:38:53 Huh...Bowser is Bluto. I can totally see it. Although I understand them fighting over Peach way more than Olive Oil.
4224 2018-07-08 21:38:47 We didn't take the oil from and any Middle East Country and you think we are going to take Venezuelan oil? You must know you're wrong bc even Sean Penn isint supporting the current dictator.
4225 2018-07-08 21:38:45 Could this be modified and used for underwater repairs on oil rigs?

4227 2018-07-08 21:38:21 Your actions speak much louder than your snake oil words Jason. Your entire #ucp caucus voted against increased funding and officers for rural policing. You don’t actually care about rural Albertans. #abpoli
4228 2018-07-08 21:38:20 Absolutely. I was vegetarian for years so I've no issue with it as a dietary approach but I'm watching this explosion of highly processed vegan food with dismay. Nutritionally inferior products like "cheese" made from modified starch and oil, etc.

4232 2018-07-08 21:37:51 Same. Was fortunate enough to be anointed with oil from a myrrh-streaming icon today
4233 2018-07-08 21:37:48 If you're in uniform its your job to be objective and fair. If you show that you have an issue with race, age, disability and or religion etc. then all of your work/investigation as a police officer is questionable & brings the whole system in disrepute.

4239 2018-07-08 21:37:13 What we must rather do is have workers from various fields, including the fields these fine, bright, young students of the Ivy League but also from the oil refineries and manufacturing plants, choose councilmen to control our land! It's happening in Rojava.

4246 2018-07-08 21:36:05 Very true! I would like to ramp BPC! You don’t sanction building a oil refinery without oil! Seen the geo surveyed area! Classic faulted anticlines! Just call me an old geologist! DYOR.

4249 2018-07-08 21:35:28 THEY WHERE GIVING THE UN UNTILL AMERICA RENEIGHED ON THE DEAL. NOW THEY ARE WITHHOLDING OIL SUPPLY TO PISH UP PRICES AND PUNISH AMERICA. LOL. BIGLY SMART

4265 2018-07-08 21:33:35 That a great white shark  in a pool of toxic oil caused by the marine disaster of oil tankers breaking up in the beautiful ocean  The message here is to save the environment.
4266 2018-07-08 21:33:33 Lol, I’m just levelheaded, no right winger not a lefty, not big oil, not a tree hugger, but when you spit things out like this, it’s just silly. The truth is we don’t know
4267 2018-07-08 21:33:18 I've only ever gotten massages through grindr. Stones rubbing crock-pot-heated Caribbean oil on my back? I'll never forget it

4269 2018-07-08 21:33:00 If you watch the replay closely you’ll see Brady rubbing oil on the ball before Joe threw it......amazing pass considering

4273 2018-07-08 21:32:32 Someone gave me beard oil. I smell more manly than ever. Please don’t sniff me tho.
4274 2018-07-08 21:31:44 As these events happen, oil prices do not fall.

4277 2018-07-08 21:31:21 And while we fight over right vs. left policies outside forces, such as Russia and China, are winning. Having a President in office who openly supports Putin adds oil to the fire in place.

4286 2018-07-08 21:30:29 Jerome, the fact that there is even more used snake oil in $grat should turn lots of heads. They already have to deal with Sheldon, now your in charge of Montreal, reminds me of $gen and $ip. Pump it!
4287 2018-07-08 21:30:21 If Argon Oil will get me in that shape I will order 10 litres of it.
4288 2018-07-08 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4289 2018-07-08 21:30:17 linda thats disgusting , il bring the oil 
4290 2018-07-08 21:30:02 Pour les vergetures apparement Bi Oil ça marche bien (strech marks veut bien dire ça ?) de ce qu'on m'a dit ! Sinon apparement acheter une brassière de sport un peu trop petite ça peut aider, mais ça dépend de la taille de ta poitrine (ça marche pas pour tout le monde) !
4291 2018-07-08 21:29:54 Goddamnit! I lost my oil pen 

Again
4292 2018-07-08 21:29:35 I use Clinique dramatically different moisturizing GEL (different from the lotion) and use a lil coconut oil on my dry spots!
4293 2018-07-08 21:29:20 Peppermint tea definitely or just breathing in peppermint essential oil
4294 2018-07-08 21:28:55 Shout out to coconut oil
4295 2018-07-08 21:28:50 Poor people are paying for all EV and also all of the ridiculous and even bigger oil industry subsidies, that favors a very small bunch of company owners. Why don’t you raise against the second kind too?
4296 2018-07-08 21:28:38 My hair will prob be up soaked in coconut oil for a while since I want to do my hair in the middle of this month so gotta make it smooth! Lol
4297 2018-07-08 21:28:30 "I'm 6" 3' do not test me."

FUCKING YEETS HIM INTO THE POOL
4298 2018-07-08 21:28:28 If I could only bottle the scent of a lit and well seasoned grill combined with just a hint of chainsaw oil.

I'd have generational wealth.

Pretty sure.
4299 2018-07-08 21:28:26 where did you buy the jojoba oil?
4300 2018-07-08 21:28:22 ChadCo, Braun and DAlone Oil?
4301 2018-07-08 21:28:11 Global economic growth highest in 11years.  US vehicle miles travelled rising again and!of new vehicles falling. Demand for oil is real but US summer gasoline rules don't help.

4306 2018-07-08 21:27:18 *Stop that!"
4307 2018-07-08 21:27:16 This is a return to gangster racket capitalism of a hundred years ago.  Threaten extort, and invade as necessary for business interests.  Instead of fruit, sugar and oil, it's baby food and supplements.  Hell, we just heard two days ago Trump wanted to invade Venezuela....
4308 2018-07-08 21:27:14 Sorry to interrupt but have you guys looked into CBD oil? I have a friend who suffers from arthritis and Joint issues after taking CBD oil he is pain-free!!!! 
You must take the high mg1 though and it's not very cheap but it works!!
4309 2018-07-08 21:26:43 the government of alberta is airing regular ads on tv to promote oil pipelines as good climate policy lol
4310 2018-07-08 21:26:35 I'm ok with a race ending under caution if it happens that way. My problem with what happened today is they had enough time to get the race restarted. They didn't have to remove a car or cleanup oil. Just had to pickup a couple of pieces of debris!
4311 2018-07-08 21:26:30 Since recently I use the eden bodyworks hair masque. Always use castor oil as well, when it was very low I just use to wash it everyday lol can't do that now

That's WHY I'm VOTING for @Morse4America 
Jess cares about protecting our LOCAL treasures and the LOCAL economies
4317 2018-07-08 21:25:44 I think the promise or how trump is paying Russia for the help.  Is the GAS merger with Exxon.  It will make them the largest oil company in the world.  Pres O stopped this.  All Putin wants is control of the world's oil.  This is treason!
4318 2018-07-08 21:25:22 I have a coffee flavored beard oil...  love it
4319 2018-07-08 21:25:16 If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from? #Showerthoughts
4320 2018-07-08 21:25:13 Oil isn't 150 a barrel anymore. Why is price still high? Taxes haven't increased 120%. Maybe the CEOs are liberals. Dare I say the name.
4321 2018-07-08 21:25:05 Jus cooked a grilled cheese with coconut oil so if you see me looking skinny don’t be alarmed
4322 2018-07-08 21:25:03 So far the best thing about my CBD oil is that it tastes of peppermint.
4323 2018-07-08 21:24:29 mate even tho it’s shit for your hair the best thing I’ve found is going in the pool with your hair down then immediately using a wide tooth comb to brush it as soon as u get out then drench it in Argan oil after washing it lol x
4324 2018-07-08 21:24:25 Palm oil 
4325 2018-07-08 21:24:23 Gosh. I thought it was the UK Government.  The Government that is reluctant to let go of Scotland and its many resources – working hand in glove with the media to promote the anti-S.N.P. message. Just as well we've got social media. Only way we know the oil fields are booming.
4326 2018-07-08 21:24:03 i just vaped cbd oil and i don’t feel shit

4334 2018-07-08 21:22:47 Lots accomplished and plenty of Sunday to go. Front yard garden watering and trimming done. Farmers market. Brunch. Olive oil run to Placerville. Now headed home. Laundry to do.
4335 2018-07-08 21:22:25 .@ChrissyCostanza just wanna say thanks for recommending the oil cleansing method girl!!! started using jojoba oil and MY SKIN IS GLOWING and it didn't caused any breakouts. a true life saver.
4336 2018-07-08 21:22:22 Wow. Dropping hot oil onto your foot is NOT the one
4337 2018-07-08 21:22:21 First mistake was that 550, leaks oil like nobody’s business
4338 2018-07-08 21:22:12 Oh shit those do look killer. Ive bleashed my own hair before and do the coconut oil thing too which helps, but fiding a good powder was always hella baffling. Thanks dude!!
4339 2018-07-08 21:21:39 Big ups to @KedarPavgi for letting me do a Costco run with him. My supply of extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and Windex was running dangerously low.
4340 2018-07-08 21:21:29 Liberators((tools)) for the central banks and oil and natural resource thieves...spreading our degeneracy
4341 2018-07-08 21:21:01 What's clear is, Pres Obama put it on to stop R's oil company from merging with Exxon, that would make them the largest oil companies in the World. A monopoly.  Pres O stopped this.  Now we know what trump paid Russia for the help they gave him Criminal!
4342 2018-07-08 21:20:48 Location wo?
4343 2018-07-08 21:20:42 Good candidate to be boiled in oil.
4344 2018-07-08 21:20:24 Hopefully you’re grilling the asparagus with olive oil, garlic, and Parmesan!!!!

4347 2018-07-08 21:19:56 Why is it that one grocery store just has their whole ethnic aisle as Mexican food and nothing else, but I go down the street to the older, smaller store in a.... Less savroy area, and the ethnic aisle is fucking amazing. I just want sesame oil that is reasonably priced damnit.
4348 2018-07-08 21:19:49 "I'm a man quite clearly! God you're dumb!"
4349 2018-07-08 21:19:42 Guys remind me again who was interested in CBD Oil please?
4350 2018-07-08 21:19:29 I wrote FORTRAN code forever ago that monitors pressure through valves in crude oil pipelines. I bet/fear it’s still in use somewhere.
4351 2018-07-08 21:19:24 I didn’t really like The Brothers Karamazov, thought the The Gambler, The Idiot and Crime and Punishment were better

4356 2018-07-08 21:18:46 ...Yea, what @AdamGrossTX said. You don't even need a chimney starter, I use a paper towel dipped in canola oil to light my fuel, other wise known as Lump charcoal.

4359 2018-07-08 21:18:23 Good idea! Let's use the $$$ from sale of oil in the pipelines to TRANSITION to solar panels!! Both ideas!
4360 2018-07-08 21:18:18 Gotta praise dem thig-- shadow! Shading looks so soft(in terms of colors) but makes it look so damn good, by any chance did you use pastel or oil color brush?

4362 2018-07-08 21:17:42 They see and know and exploit for personal gain.  Melt the permafrost, then they can drill for oil up by the Arctic circle.
4363 2018-07-08 21:17:40 use butter. instead of oil, and a little bit of saurkraut with the onions is good. Don't forget to make gravy and put it over mashed potatoes or fried potatoes or potato knishes or tornado potatoes or baked potatoes or boiled new potatoes or all of the above
4364 2018-07-08 21:17:22 foolishly ran nearly a mile on pavement that had been in the sun all day, applying coconut oil to my feet
4365 2018-07-08 21:17:12 My man is out getting my car an oil change and running errands while I clean up our apartment. There's always teamwork in our marriage 
4366 2018-07-08 21:17:00 I’m a tan shinning ball of coconut oil
4367 2018-07-08 21:16:47 "Stop it. You're being rude-"
4368 2018-07-08 21:16:43 It’s almost like, as soon as we stopped holding them to a verifiable anti-nuke deal, they stopped harassing our ships. Hmmm, is there a Trump hotel getting built in Tehran? Iranian oil money bailing out 666 Fifth Avenue? Only the #LiarInChief knows #TraitorTrump
4369 2018-07-08 21:16:43 Tell me: Where would England be if not for its cheap oil and gas in Scotland, as well as it's naval bases. Where would they be without water from Wales, sent from reservoirs that indigenous communities were flooded to build? What about the coal historically mined from Wales?
4370 2018-07-08 21:16:09 This is what trump has been waiting 4.   The trade to b lifted.  Now he will allow Exxon to Merge with Russian oil making them the largest oil companies in the World.  Now we know what Russias price was 4 helping trump. DT will now pay R.  Criminal
4371 2018-07-08 21:15:54 I love and use the oil vertiver.
4372 2018-07-08 21:15:49 Suntan lotion is a scam. It’s literally just mayo and olive oil mixed with chemical X, ammonia, and banana coconut flavoring.
4373 2018-07-08 21:15:34 I need to change the oil in my life.

4376 2018-07-08 21:14:28 Olive Oil for lube... nice
4377 2018-07-08 21:14:15 He huffed a little. 

"Even someone of my preference knows that calling a woman babe despite your lack of a connection is improper!"
4378 2018-07-08 21:14:07 That’s bullshit - “combating climate change” is going to be money into engineering solutions, new power sources (building wind turbines and solar plants), CO2 sequestration in old oil and gas wells and new vehicles with electric motors.
4379 2018-07-08 21:13:55 That sounds fair, but I wouldn’t worry about coming off as a snake oil salesman. Microbiome dysbiosis and a growing range of bacteria, viruses fungi etc are now tied to an increasing number of inflammatory disease states. It’s just reality
4380 2018-07-08 21:13:55 Everybody’s after the oil.
4381 2018-07-08 21:13:50 Changed the oil in my motorcycle and put in new spark plugs. We think the carborator may need cleaning. So still no riding for Rainbows 
4382 2018-07-08 21:13:49 Right... it's a conspiracy driven by all those billionaire bully scientists.  Golly, my heart just BREAKS for the oil and gas guys!  They're helpless and weak against such propaganda, I heard some of them may have to consider selling their private towns.  I'm broken.

4384 2018-07-08 21:13:29 you can use coconut oil for damn near anything. shit even toothpaste, mix it in wit food, deodarant too. etc
4385 2018-07-08 21:13:23 Oil field has best service companies how can drill with auto tracking and placement of the well. They had drill many relief wells with success. Just we need Expert Directional Driller & MWDs and they will do great job. @elonmusk #ThaiCaveRescue

4389 2018-07-08 21:12:46 They can print their daily savings and tie that to saving trees, barrels of oil, showing investors or the community around schools how they are changing the game. But big union facilities corps also don't like that.

4395 2018-07-08 21:11:04 When my kids were little they gave lessons to adult hotel guests on how to correctly operate the waffle-maker. Points included “spray with oil first” and “flip it over half way through cooking”.

4401 2018-07-08 21:10:34 that would make sense, they know oil wont last forever and will want a good interest\control of what comes next.
4402 2018-07-08 21:10:32 It's almost like he doesn't realize that the destabilization of Syria was caused by the US in order to gain access to an untapped oil reserve while also giving Israel more land to oppress by their border.

...but that's none of my business.

4412 2018-07-08 21:09:14 MSM, it’s about time. Just a snake oil side show with Lie after Lie
4413 2018-07-08 21:09:12 No.they are up to no good. They have assets all over the world. Remember these two are the ultimate carpetbagging, snake oil salesmen. Or persons. I don’t think of Hillary as female.
4414 2018-07-08 21:09:01 Did no-one inform Lord Digby that 100% of our money goes South before 8% of it comes back North.
So thank you Westminster for taking 92% of our money and keeping it for yourselves, not to mention our oil money! 
4415 2018-07-08 21:09:00 Why are we told we are obliged to these agreements? I never signed it.
Also, we should propose a Cesium 137 tax and use it to clean up Russia and Japan.
That should get France off our back re: oil.
4416 2018-07-08 21:08:50 Well, currently the Ford dealership next to me is hiring oil change techs with no experience starting at 20$ an hour. California central coast. This is how desperate they are to find young people that aren’t afraid to get dirty. No reminiscing here.
4417 2018-07-08 21:08:32 I’ve heard so many good things about CBD oil. It’s mad that it isn’t prescribed by medical practitioners, considering the extent to which it has repeatedly been shown to benefit various ailments in research

4437 2018-07-08 21:05:37 Agreed, we need more lead in our water, more toxins in the air, oil free flowing on the ground.
4438 2018-07-08 21:05:36 All good suggestions, open windows a must in heatwave. Bucket of boiling oil? Street lighting already set to blinding stadium level by city council, another reason to lose sleep around here 
4439 2018-07-08 21:05:06 bro so last week i made a hair growth oil and one of the ingredients was flaxseed oil using some of the capsules i take daily. after i popped them, i put them aside and then added boiling water to get the leftover oil out and put it in the fridge.
4440 2018-07-08 21:05:03 Oil price jump might "Drag gas along with it"?  Who wrote this stupid headline?  CNBC doesn't have anybody on the payroll that knows that gasoline is made from oil?
4441 2018-07-08 21:05:00 @steve_sedgwick I’m watching your Interview with Jim O’Neill in December last year. Where he predicted that the oil price would be between $60-80 a barrel. It would be in his opinion closer to $80. Who knew?

4444 2018-07-08 21:03:55 If you want to get into the philosophy of money that is a diff topic. Countries value the US dollar b/c of what oil is priced in and in the reliability that entails. 

Making the $ sought after does exactly what I described, only it fit in a tweet.
4445 2018-07-08 21:03:53 My hunch is:  we will find out more when Trump returns after his tete-en-tete with Putin.  Trump's actions will tell us what they talked about.  I hear tell that Putin desires to be the Emperor of World Oil.... ?? Others probably know a lot more than me.
4446 2018-07-08 21:03:24 I mean Colombia’s main export is oil and its derivatives. Read into my tweet how you want.

4456 2018-07-08 21:01:43 Dude, stop it with the sycophantic electronic drool. It’s embarrassing to even read it. Just go get yourself an inflatable Trump doll, and every time he tweets, oil it up and exhaust yourself. It’s a win-win. We don’t read your  and you don’t show your condition to the world.

4490 2018-07-08 20:56:01 Ditto Wales. The British Empire depended on Welsh coal and steel. We produced far more than we needed and were  never paid for the surplus. We subsidised England. Now it is water - more essential than gold, coal or oil. The latter, of course, supplied in abundance by Scots.

4498 2018-07-08 20:54:51 My girlfriend brought me back oils from her trip to Morocco they have a scent to them because some are derived from goat droppings. But def some of the best oils I ever used. She knows I’m a oil snob.
4499 2018-07-08 20:54:41 Please use regardless rather tha irregardless in the future and remember we are the only living mammals hell bent in destroying the planet, which this statement proves: ‘No more apologies. We produce fair trade oil to the best environmental standards on earth.’.

4502 2018-07-08 20:54:04 No, we’re not overthrowing Assad.  Russia is in Syria for one thing - Oil.  Iran is in Syria for one thing - annihilate Israel - but wil never happen. Israel is bombing Iranian military bases with Russia’s blessings as long as Israel doesn’t overthrow Assad’s regime.

4505 2018-07-08 20:53:53 Ever wonder why other countries always use the US dollar over pretty much anything else?

B/c globally countries have agreed to value oil barrels in US dollars. It maintains the value of the currency over anything else.
4506 2018-07-08 20:53:31 We all do the same thing.When you buy a car, put on a new roof, change your furnance. You look at quality,etc but cost is a factor. .you want a deal.

the rest is just "dressing"
4509 2018-07-08 20:53:17 What! You probably intend to scour the Moon for oil. Then build an oil pipeline from the Moon to the Earth! Obviously impossible. But not in your mind.

4511 2018-07-08 20:53:04 But the Shah of Iran was imposed on Iran on the basis of a British/American backed coup, to replace a democratically elected leader who was too idealistic to bend to UK/US demands over cheap oil.

This basically set up the whole terrible situation.
And you want the US in again?

4514 2018-07-08 20:52:36 But at least film incentives have caps. Some states have unlimited tax incentives.

Texas has one that mostly gives incentives to oil and gas companies (who were going to be here anyway). And the cost will go up to $1 billion a year in a few years.

Lying in the dark waiting for sleep is counterproductive (for me at least). there are natural pills as well, maybe those could help you?
4520 2018-07-08 20:50:33 The exact year in which the trend begins to change is not even "the middle of the 70s", as the graph states, but 1973, which is when the oil crisis bursted. This and the abandon of gold standard to shift from productive economy to financial economy could explain most of the graph

4538 2018-07-08 20:48:48 Doing nothing will also put more money in rich people's pockets.  Who do you think owns the oil companies and makes private jets?
4539 2018-07-08 20:48:24 Tanning oil!!!!
4540 2018-07-08 20:48:16 Coconut oil as a mask will save me!
4541 2018-07-08 20:48:14 @sussex_police I appreciate your not on this contantly however there's a large oil spill on a road in Newhaven. Who would I contact about this?
4542 2018-07-08 20:47:58 Iranian officials now are threatening to block the Strait oh Hormuz where 30% of the worlds oil transits each day. Will start if Trump keeps up his threats and will raise gas prices even higher.
4543 2018-07-08 20:47:44 Who are the groups that stand to benefit from the denial of climate change? Those with all the money and power right now! That’s the big oil and energy companies that dont want to change. But you just keep believing what they pay Fox News & Republican politicians to tell you.
4544 2018-07-08 20:47:42 The Koch Bros' father Fred built oil refineries for Joseph Stalin. No reason to disbelieve that the Koch Bros' current ties to Putin and the oligarchs is really messing with our political system.

Pan-fried Uncured Black Forest Ham, Seared Peaches & Gorgonzola crumbs .. topped w/ fresh Thyme, extra virgin olive oil drizzle over Thai Wide Rice Noodles

4550 2018-07-08 20:47:00 Words and chants pale in comparison to the hurt that Senate NRA Leader McConnel has done to Americans. He's all in for the wealthy, big corporations, insurance, pharmaceutical, and oil companies. He's taken away benefits, safety nets, environmental protection, and he's not done.
4551 2018-07-08 20:46:44 homicides go unsolved because people protect the "innocent babies" doing the shootings.
besides... when Mr and Mrs good citizen are the only ones disarmed, why would they feel safe ratting out the neighbor and his gang?
4552 2018-07-08 20:46:30 Ok, the fresh Sage, Rosemary and Parsley are taking over the garden. I’m taking seasoned olive oil orders. Let me know if you want some.

4558 2018-07-08 20:45:26 Nah, some real-world equivalent of Harry King in the Terry Pratchett novels is, right now, building a boat to skim the ocean and turn all that plastic into oil, which he'll then sell back to us.

4563 2018-07-08 20:44:43 Watching the violence unfold in Haiti as a result of oil price hikes and I want people to remember:
1. Haiti was once France's wealthiest colony.
2. Haiti has been in debt since independence because we were forced to pay reparations to slaveowners.
3. Poverty breeds violence.

4568 2018-07-08 20:43:47 So, as part of the UK, there is no such thing as ‘Scottish Oil’ but there is ‘English Shale Gas’. Go figure.
4569 2018-07-08 20:43:40 Mangan are you opposed to olive oil as well?
4570 2018-07-08 20:43:26 Looking into CBD Oil. A local place had some for purchase but holy cow! So expensive! Is that generally what happens? Am I gonna have to have a funeral for my wallet?
4571 2018-07-08 20:42:52 I just shaved with coconut oil and exfoliated my whole body with that St. Ives apricot scrub. Honeyyyyyy I’m so smooth.

4581 2018-07-08 20:41:51 I just need a bitch to oil my scalp THATS IT
4582 2018-07-08 20:41:41 Dotard, do you realize that EPA stands for Environmental Protection Agency.  The purpose of this agency is to protect the environment.  It is not supposed to be the lobbying arm of the coal and oil industries.
4583 2018-07-08 20:41:40 Maybe he needs a dose of II Peter 3 and Revelation 6- 20. Yes, it will be destroyed by fire, not climate change. Due to the righteous wrath of God, not the oil companies. Humankind, though it believes is a god, cannot escape the judgment of God for its disrespect of Him.
4584 2018-07-08 20:41:32 Man, i was there Last August, the only thing that helps is good beardoil to prevent itching, cedar oil helps a lot, aside from that, drink a lot,...
4585 2018-07-08 20:41:25 So I need to brush it but once I finished I put some oil in it and it seems okay now
4586 2018-07-08 20:41:06 JUST A REMINDER.....DID YOU ORDER YOUR CBD OIL?
4587 2018-07-08 20:41:03 We support NATO so WWII doesn’t happen again. It’s happening already, Russia is dismantling every alliance it can in order to grab the oil using this stable genius.

4600 2018-07-08 20:38:59 Travis' many glands have been bloated and filled with oil thanks to his time in Oklahoma and can fetch a high price on the black market.
4601 2018-07-08 20:38:40 The only way I could see 80 being hit is if the rebound from 26 is wave D of a descending triangle from peak oil rather than a wave 4/C. 100 is crazy thinking.
4602 2018-07-08 20:38:38 Straight dipped in the finest holy oil 
4603 2018-07-08 20:38:34 Seriously craving panla stew with boiled egg soaked in the oil, from that popular buka on Allen avenue (can't remember the name).

4606 2018-07-08 20:37:57 You keep loosing like the immature kid you are with your lame post and your President, Donald J Trump will keep working even for you. Have you noticed the booming economy? Unemployment lowest in more than 2 decades? America on its way from relying on foreign oil etc?
4607 2018-07-08 20:37:44 I love it up everything still poppin on a sunday nigga i just got my oil changed on a sunday..!!

4609 2018-07-08 20:37:31 Stay away from the cheese if it taste like an oil slick.
4610 2018-07-08 20:37:18 We don’t need to control the population, technology always takes care of that problem.  See the Mathusians and their ilk from the 1960s-80s on topics like Peak Oil.  We need to invest in tech to solve pop. Problems.
4611 2018-07-08 20:37:13 Ohhh no no no. Do a bit of research and you will realise its not the answer - it's being pushed as the solution by the big oil companies and anyone with vested interest in the technology.
4612 2018-07-08 20:37:12 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q

4614 2018-07-08 20:36:58 There is NO innocent authors on the other side. Only scam artist sock puppets. Trying to sell snake oil to the villagers. Only they didn’t expect guardians at the post!
4615 2018-07-08 20:36:57 But data is NOT the new oil - and when we say that we help persist the fallacy that bits are like bread (and hence that intellectual "property" rights are like property rights rather than the monopoly rights they are - we need #RemunerationRights)
4616 2018-07-08 20:36:49 bicho como assim você é daqui e não conhece o oil man knjxkskdj
4617 2018-07-08 20:36:46 1. Parsing Fox News article, but leaving out the best part:
Iranian officials, though, now are threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz, where 30 percent of the world’s oil transits each day in and out of the Persian Gulf, something that could jeopardize the suspension
4618 2018-07-08 20:36:36 It will sit well in the lane beside a 2015 commitment to the environment and then trying to ram oil tankers through Metro Vancouver and with his UN speech on FN’s and lack of action after that. Like bowling pins  !

4630 2018-07-08 20:34:55 I dumped an entire economy sized tin of olive oil on the couch  I don’t remember this, but it feels like something toddler-me would be into
4631 2018-07-08 20:34:47 Which means he agrees with war for oil and an insane death toll for profit

4642 2018-07-08 20:33:11 Oh I don’t think that’s so at all. If they had oil in any significant quantity, their government could have fended off the taliban. They don’t. I expect you know more about it than I do!
4643 2018-07-08 20:33:11 Thanks for calling BS on this Jess.  I’m in that field. We all could have made much more in careers with Big Oil!

4650 2018-07-08 20:32:21 I'll have to read up about them. Sounds like it's immigration that worrying you guys. Plus you really want to sell oil which we all know great for the planet!
4651 2018-07-08 20:32:19 Since I am a shill for oil/coal/monacled villains with top hats, I hope someone can set this straight for me... When production numbers objectively suck and orders are met earlier than expected, what does that say about demand?
4652 2018-07-08 20:32:13 Mr. President, the higher price of oil goes, the faster the inflation reaches. Hence, recession is reality; thus, job losses.
4653 2018-07-08 20:31:57 Cbd oil basically gets you high

4657 2018-07-08 20:31:40 NOV 4th When Iran sells oil to China, Turkey & Europe? We go to war with Iran? I guess Israel is gonna take the hit for false evidence of WMD this time? The USD is on a fast track to devalue. Todays tough trade talk is panic our allies wont defend the USD$  4 false flag attacks
4658 2018-07-08 20:31:13 Total coincidence. That is like saying the Chinese govt. bans guns to have power over its people.

4676 2018-07-08 20:28:23 no... I’m speaking in regards to deep conditioning , oil treatments , etc
4677 2018-07-08 20:28:16 So they can use the money to pay their gasoline bills because oil went up.
4678 2018-07-08 20:27:55 Repealing Obamacare would boost the heck out of an already thriving economy. It would be better than the 1980s. Honestly, here in Texas, it already feels like the 80’s, with all the oil, and gas production going on. Great thread, btw.
4679 2018-07-08 20:27:46 Having Oil Costs You That You Have Surrendered Your Right To Be Right!
4680 2018-07-08 20:27:30 He did all that to not change my oil lol he looked tired anyways :
4681 2018-07-08 20:27:25 There are several U.S. oil companies with interest in the sand oil deposits in Canada. I wonder if Russia is a silent partner with one of them.
4682 2018-07-08 20:27:15 They would want to enforce the cave border

4685 2018-07-08 20:26:56 Unless there’s been a large oil find in Londonland you’ll not see yanks with guns anytime soon I’m thinking. 

What an absolute fuckwit you are. Even by Tory standards.
4686 2018-07-08 20:26:37 Like seriously Femi Fani-Kayode insults and curses alone is enough reason for them to react but no, their oil wells are under threat they must safeguard that by all means.
4687 2018-07-08 20:26:18 Try CBD oil, that’s what I use to help with my pain from MS and it was life changing honestly
4688 2018-07-08 20:26:15 You so greasy you probably bleed oil.

4692 2018-07-08 20:25:44 CBD oil is literally like gold oil. There seems to be very little it doesn’t have a positive influence on.
4693 2018-07-08 20:25:20 Apply lotion or body oil while your body is still damp. This will make your skin softer and smoother.
4694 2018-07-08 20:25:08 
It woulda been something else
4695 2018-07-08 20:25:06 that's great! i have chronic pain but i didn't find CBD oil helpful. i'm so thrilled it worked for you!  #BPDChat
4696 2018-07-08 20:24:57 I use Luna sleeping night oil by Sunday Riley at night also!

4700 2018-07-08 20:24:30 Once done you can use a drop (DROP) of sewing machine oil on a few of the points (don't know which ones without looking).  There might be grease points too, but those need to be seen too.
4701 2018-07-08 20:24:23 Needa change my oil after work
4702 2018-07-08 20:24:19 And the oil and coal industry IS clearly driven by money and have the most to lose if people believe in climate change and most to gain if people believe climate change is a hoax
4703 2018-07-08 20:24:19 Seriously! you stare bad strategic management in the face and you call it elasticity. There was a very good reason for the strategic oil and it was for this very reason. But government wanted to stick it to white people and show they know better. What a victory ne’
4704 2018-07-08 20:24:02 @JuliaDavisNews Julia, as someone who knows: why did they go? Kissing up to Trump? Doesn't seem like enough. A way of saying "hey don't meddle in elections!" (But actually, please do, wink wink)
Oil interests? How does this help?
4705 2018-07-08 20:24:00 All of them.
4706 2018-07-08 20:23:55 #BPDChat slightly off topic but I just had some CBD Oil and I actually think it has helped

Fish. In fudge bars.

4723 2018-07-08 20:21:38 Yes, I agree.That needs 2 happen but also w/compassion. CA is booming now. Unfortunately 1 of the downsides of a boom economy is homelessness simply because it’s become unaffordable & also lots of ppl want 2 move here. North Dakota is going thru a similar challenge w/its oil boom

4726 2018-07-08 20:20:41 The return of Lukoil!  It was precisely Lukoil that Cambridge Analytica was pitching its services to in 2015 (I think it was).  Chris Wylie kept asking Alexander Nix, "So why are we pitching an oil company with our powers to control democratic elections?"  He never got an answer.
4727 2018-07-08 20:20:30 Both sides were taking money from the oil companies. That's completely standard practice in the U.S. If we applied the same rules here all of congress would be in jail, lol.

4735 2018-07-08 20:20:01 Is this because of oil and gas advertisers?
4736 2018-07-08 20:19:50 You steal oil from Brazil. Learn how to compete fairly or go home.

4741 2018-07-08 20:19:25 Great but for who?
Trump is just a snake oil salesman.
His sales pitch is that all NATO members should have 2% MIL spending /GDP. 
On this I agree.
My only concern is, considering NATO vs. Russia's military might, I wouldn't be too surprised if he suggests to pull out of it.

4751 2018-07-08 20:18:31 Brazil is very corrupt and their oil is difficult to extract. W/out the RU effort to kill to other sources of energy, Brazil oil would stay deep underground where it belongs. Not surprised RU started its corruption around here.

I’m part Mexican - I rarely eat in mex restaurants bc most are gross & dumbed down for the gringos.
I still go to bookstores in hopes of finding older editions that haven’t been dumbed down for SJW language hoops.
I’m a conservative. 
Stop telling me what to do.

4784 2018-07-08 20:12:39 Obviously, the higher the price of oil, the faster the inflation goes.  Then the faster the recession becomes reality. President Trump is right to call for lower price of oil.

4809 2018-07-08 20:09:34 You are naive as EU has absolute power to implode Russia without firing a shot. By simply erasing 10% of Russian GDP by banning oil sales from RU to EU. It would be a repeat of USSR defection when they cant afford to pay their own military.
4810 2018-07-08 20:09:34 Good afternoon DaddyBear! Based on the following "Statement from the Joint Commission" it would seem to me that some of the upward pressure due to Iran supply constraints is now off the table for crude oil (statement to follow)...
4811 2018-07-08 20:09:28 Great post. When I was an IT tech, virtually every PC I opened to service was full of dust balls. Blowing out dust should be considered routine-but-critical maintenance, like changing a car’s oil.
4812 2018-07-08 20:09:18 Coconut oil helps if you want longer eyelashes. Just apply the coconut oil on your eyelashes.
4813 2018-07-08 20:09:13 My poor son has shimmer all over him from my body oil lol. I feel like a bad mom
4814 2018-07-08 20:08:45 And if you elected him mayor of Chicago you might have a case. But he represents diffent people than Chitown, so its really not his problem. Unless do you hold Trump responsible for getting Russians more oil jobs?
4815 2018-07-08 20:08:36 A2: A couple drops oregano oil in warm water, sipped, can stop strep throat for me. Tea tree oil is part of my haircare routine to manage seborrheic dermatitis. #LupusChat

4821 2018-07-08 20:07:30 You got the bottle of patron? If so that's bless oil to the cadets.
4822 2018-07-08 20:07:05 Go look at what the oil prices have been doing for the last two months, while at it look at the strength of the dollar and lastly read on what OPEC have agreed on the same period. If you know how to make use of the elasticity in economics, then you'll understand.
4823 2018-07-08 20:06:43 Yup.  Oil spots in the garage.  Exactly what I was thinking.
4824 2018-07-08 20:06:35 Well that's a few more oil wars we'll be left out of, yay
4825 2018-07-08 20:06:10 I got bloobs, mozza, arugula, basil, hemp seeds, garlic pan-seared chicken, lemon+olive oil dressing all in a bowl and i am happy!!
4826 2018-07-08 20:05:15 But he sure knows how to get a big old bag of Rubles! 
He is working awful hard for them though! Giving Russia ultimate control over oil with his latest move! He is alienating US allies, so they are without a superpower, and will open the door for Russia to do what they want!
4827 2018-07-08 20:05:12 There’s a shopping centre in Devon called Trago Mills where all of it is like that. Found a display case with trumpets, air rifles and drumsticks in. Motor oil next to Easter eggs. Genuinely had a mild panic attack first time I went.
4828 2018-07-08 20:05:09 All those SOB need 2 B boil in oil at the least
4829 2018-07-08 20:05:02 Josh Tomlin was one of your favorite shirts and now he’s the rag you use to clean up oil spots in the garage.
4830 2018-07-08 20:04:37 The dark side of wrestling.  We called it getting your oil checked.
4831 2018-07-08 20:04:14 Today I learned how to change oil for a car (and by learn I mean watch my dad do it and explain things that make absolutely no sense to me).

4840 2018-07-08 20:03:00 Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content, for example oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.

4841 2018-07-08 20:02:35 When @coburnnews teaches you how to change your oil in 90 degree, Florida heat  #friendshipgoals
4842 2018-07-08 20:02:23 I'm super bullish oil and can't disagree. Still think it will go higher this driving season then pull back a bit on seasonal weakness. Will likely be next summer when we see $100 oil.
4843 2018-07-08 20:02:23 You can probably sub any gentle exfoliant and vitamin c serum for similar results, but I would swear by their cleanser and their marula oil.
4844 2018-07-08 20:02:22 Not at all - at least PPP has good gender rhetoric while PTI shamelessly peddles religion- but we need so much better Pakistan is beautiful
4845 2018-07-08 20:02:09 You fucking legend! That’s one of my fap parts of the movie! Clothes burnt off on the oil rig .... 
4846 2018-07-08 20:01:49 So you view oil sold by a dictatorship where the profits are used to bomb civilians as being the same as oil sold by a democracy and used to fund social services? Gotta love the moral relativism underlying your position
4847 2018-07-08 20:01:47 Yeah, that’s always good except I know very little about folk, I grew up with glam and punk. We had a great time @ChippFolk last year though and met some super sides 
4848 2018-07-08 20:01:43 I'm so turnt off this essential oil diffuser dont tell mom 
4849 2018-07-08 20:01:27 Even if they greased you down with a vat of oil you still wouldn’t fit
4850 2018-07-08 20:01:23 Their so-called 'knowledge' is confined to a knife's edge of focus.  Get them out of their comfort zone and they crumble into little pieces.  In order to be educated, you MUST read that which makes you uncomfortable.  You have to expose yourself to differing philosophies.
4851 2018-07-08 20:01:20 I’m brining baby oil to the beach tomorrow because I was trying to bake for an hour and I see no changes in my skin tone. My tryna get chocolate!
4852 2018-07-08 20:01:20 If we are so dependent on England why don’t you cut us loose and let us be independent? - oh wait, without whisky, gas, oil, financial services, fishing, shellfish exports, gaming industry, tourism & life sciences the UK economy would go down the tubes!
4853 2018-07-08 20:01:15 When enough money is at stake ANY politician or corporate officer is corruptible.

4877 2018-07-08 19:58:09 The Drunk Elephant line completely changed my skin. I think the key is less cleansing (only at night), more moisture (all of their moisturizers are good but my skin soaks up the oil that preps it for serum and top layer of moisture), and tons of gentle exfoliation.
4878 2018-07-08 19:58:09 ok storytime: ive been @ the beach n applying wht i thot was tanning oil the whole time n abt 3 hrs in my mom offered to help get my back n she goes wait liv this is dry styling oil wtf I WAS USIN F*ING HAIR OIL INSTEAD OF TANNING OIL FOR THE PAST 3 HRS I grAbbEd tHe WRonG bOttLE

4884 2018-07-08 19:57:04 Trump’s blasting away ignorantly about Iran hasn’t helped keep the global oil market stable. 

His strangely deciding our allies are the bad guys keeps all commerce unsteady. 

So he shares some of the blame for higher gas prices.
4885 2018-07-08 19:56:42 Respecting rule of law and following the Constitution is now right-wing and reactionary?

4886 2018-07-08 19:56:41 -in the shower while it has conditioner in it every so often, and i do an overnight castor oil scalp massage every week, using the inversion method(its rly good for hair growth and overall hair health but it might leave ur hair oily in the morning if u dont shampoo good enough)

4889 2018-07-08 19:55:45 Some of what you say is wrong but here’s the most important point: He won WW2.  At least this was a legit war unlike the gulf wars which were about oil and money.
4890 2018-07-08 19:55:44 They've got us beat though with books on the occult, transgender issues, LBGT issues, anti-Trump tomes, etc.  Anything worth reading, though, heck no, they don't have time for it.  Like the Constitution or any of the classics written by old white men (mainly).
4891 2018-07-08 19:55:21 Don’t forget the French didn’t fight when we were attacked on 9/11. The bastards let us down, we had 9/11 because of Europe dragging us to solve the Middle East problem. At that time America only got 3% of the oil from there while Europe gets 60%
4892 2018-07-08 19:55:16 Did your experience involve sitting in the asshat salesman’s office while he supposedly “conferred” with his manager to see if he could give you such a “great deal”, only to be offered free car mats and an oil change instead?

4897 2018-07-08 19:54:50 Chi what do you think of Chris cooks comments regarding the USD and oil now being correlated?  Since April it sure seems like it but if it continues will devastate EM's if it hasn't already.

4902 2018-07-08 19:53:43 It's not.

I know there are too many factors involved. Just like what's happening in Turkey and Venezuela, some POWERFUL people don't want Iran to be the wealthy, democratic country it used to be.

So MANY things are involved, even the price of crude oil.

CHANGE will come. 
4903 2018-07-08 19:53:26 It’s so maddening. I’ve even tried putting cooking oil and covering everything else up. Nope, still undercooked and white

- apply olive oil and pad with a cotton ball !
- stay hydrated many liquids water is recommended  !
- try new fruits and veggies such as fresher fruit and vegetables  !
4906 2018-07-08 19:52:56 because the issue is wrongly called a " muslim issue.
Violent extremism emerged as a result of illegal sanctions and wars.  These factors were a prelude to regime changes , all cooked up. There was going to be a reaction , this time by isis. Dress it as one way. For oil and gas
4907 2018-07-08 19:52:54 He's full of shit. He will get a job with an oil company as a lobbyist.

4913 2018-07-08 19:51:12 With the rise in oil prices, it's time to switch to an alternative
4914 2018-07-08 19:50:58 Why is he still talking to me...let's see I need to pick up my laundry, get my oil changed and oh yeah I need to pick up milk on the way home

4930 2018-07-08 19:48:53 That must bother you. Solar is infinite and gas and oil are a commodity that you can control.
4931 2018-07-08 19:48:47 The increase in gas prices started with the hurricanes. President Trump didn't have anything to do with that. And oil prices have risen.  Not his fault either

4939 2018-07-08 19:47:43 What someone #divest others will #invest. The demand for gas, oil and coal is increasing globally whatever moral level you are on. To produce windmills and solar panel fossil fuels have a near monopoly.
4940 2018-07-08 19:47:30 Need to do this oil change but it’s too fkn hot 
4941 2018-07-08 19:47:29 Let me look them up specifically- but the EPA regulations on drilling, coal mining, the oil lines. Allowing gaming restrictions to be lifted on endangered species, allowing access to our National parks for these things as well.
4942 2018-07-08 19:47:22 Okay so here's the pumpkin coffee one (comes out more like a latte).

-12oz coffee
-1Tbsp pumpkin puree
-2Tbsp coconut milk
-1/4tsp pumpkin spice
-1/4tsp cinnamon
-1Tbsp unsalted butter
-1/2Tbsp coconut oil
-1Tbsp stevia

Throw it in a blender. Mix on high. Enjoy that shit.
4943 2018-07-08 19:47:18 Βρήκα ένα ξεχασμένο baby oil απ´την εποχή που δεν ξόδευα μια περιουσία σε λάδια σώματος και το έβαλα και νιώθω ότι θα ανοίξει η πόρτα και θα πεταχτεί ο Rocco Siffredi να κάνουμε γύρισμα
4944 2018-07-08 19:47:17 Ah, the fab Beltane 
4945 2018-07-08 19:47:03 I'm glad you had fun!  I haven't had any in a while, I might need to make a batch of oil.
4946 2018-07-08 19:46:54 1. Groom your eyebrows!
if you want to get thick eyebrows, put castor oil on your eyebrows every night for 2 weeks and watch them grow
4947 2018-07-08 19:46:40 this just screams "I don't know how science works". Even if you don't believe in climate change, wouldn't switching to renewable energy be more cost efficient in the long run? You know, considering that oil and coal are limited resources? there's so much wrong with what you said.
4948 2018-07-08 19:46:32 I put melatonin oil on my face thinking it was my serum
4949 2018-07-08 19:46:31 Tunaofanya shopping, Shakira vegetable cooking oil has been banned.
4950 2018-07-08 19:46:31 I was told in a qucikstudies painting class (20 minute oil paintings) that it’s not about painting fast. It’s about making the right decision first. From what I can see, your decision making is purtty gooooood.
4951 2018-07-08 19:46:30 I’m not sure why you don’t consider @WesternWireNet a new site, other than your opposition to oil and gas. Does your argument apply to wealthy foundations that fund anti-fossil fuel outlets too?
4952 2018-07-08 19:46:30 Its really shocking. Does  @TimesNow has started recruiting jihadi minded people as anchors just for the sake of oil money as funding. Really shameful.. @TimesNow must sack such jihadi minded people operating under the garb of journalism..

4955 2018-07-08 19:45:58 I woke up this morning to go to church and my car was washed, vacuumed and had it’s oil changed. Then as I was leaving my parents gave me money to go eat after. I’m never moving out... 
4956 2018-07-08 19:45:50 I looked after my mum as her 24 hour a day carer for 6 years until she died, I needed to get something for my nerve damage and he scammed me out of my last £600, took my money and I didn't get my cannabis oil
4957 2018-07-08 19:45:39 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
4958 2018-07-08 19:45:33 *Right, then. A deep breath, and Merlin's bending to kiss him again. He can't hesitate. He's riding a wave of exhilarated courage and mustn't lose it. It takes him only seconds to slather the oil on himself. Too much perhaps, it's dripping messily, but that's better than too >
4959 2018-07-08 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4960 2018-07-08 19:45:16 That's classic Alaskan art and classic mobile home panelling. 

My brother decided to use his mechanical skills to drill for oil in the Arctic ocean which is a loss for the banking sector.

4966 2018-07-08 19:44:29 Try substituting using butter with olive oil if you can! Way less intense and healthier
4967 2018-07-08 19:44:24 Who cares.  We have more oil that anywhere in the world!
4968 2018-07-08 19:44:14 There is no ICU in our district hospital, my nephew accidentally drank kerosene oil and they referred him to RWP Head Quarter hospital, he died on his way to the hospital near Mandra, took his last breath in the arms of his mother. Imagine the pain we have to go through.
4969 2018-07-08 19:43:50 The other day I found out that @ChickfilA cooks with peanut oil and I’ve eaten there and haven’t died yet 
4970 2018-07-08 19:43:42 update: i am not making fry bread today, because i reached for the jug of oil and it was almost empty, and no other oil in the house should be used for frying. woops.
4971 2018-07-08 19:43:42 That decentralization is a myth. Just a few states who can boast of IGRs devoid of crude oil revenue. Tribalism, yea
4972 2018-07-08 19:43:24 I’ll give u one *puts on some romantic music to listen to to relax u a bit then puts oil on ur back and rubs it on ur shoulders to ur feet and back up deeply from ur butt up to ur back u like that*

4975 2018-07-08 19:42:32 @Cath_Kidston i had a bag bought me as a present,it has a rust coloured mark right round the zipper on the oil cloth,its 12 months old but surely it shouldnt do it?
4976 2018-07-08 19:42:24 fish isn't an essential food item as marine omega 3's can be obtained from algal oil (for about 20cents a day), and we can convert some ALA (land/plant omega 3's) into marine omega 3s. Although I would greatly welcome lab grown meats as no animal would need to be harmed for taste
4977 2018-07-08 19:42:16 You’d probably get an oil like High almost I assume but prob lit as hell tbh
4978 2018-07-08 19:41:58 Today's achievements include getting a trailer hitch installed, oil change and tire rotation, quick in-and-out at Target, and a hair cut. Adulting level: high.

4980 2018-07-08 19:41:41 Noooooooo  sorry Eccles Reds. Hope you get home soon. Can I help? Admittedly if it’s not a tyre change or oil refill, I’m probably out on the mechanics front (and even on those, not sure I’m equipped beyond a basic car!!) but anything else I can do, let me know?
4981 2018-07-08 19:41:39 the box does not specify all ingredients properly Oreo has officially stated on their site that oreos are not vegan just a heads up if any of you are vegan. also they are made with palm oil whose harvesting is destroying animal habitats and contributing to major deforestation.

4985 2018-07-08 19:41:28 Anyone ever consider where illegal aliens are actually living? Could not these dwellings be used for Americans? 
Conclusion is illegals displace Americans driving up cost/availability of housing.
4986 2018-07-08 19:41:06 Slice it & cook in a frying pan with a bit of olive oil.
4987 2018-07-08 19:40:58 Unfortunately, Ned, I have to agree. Slick snake oil triumphs again - until we are confronted with the inevitable chaos that is following.
4988 2018-07-08 19:40:39 Frying with peanut oil is the best
4989 2018-07-08 19:40:38 On one side, we have people racking up decades worth of non-dischargeable debt in the pursuit of a job in academia.

In the other, we have the oil industry.

I wonder which of these groups is more profit-motivated.

4994 2018-07-08 19:40:04 From my lonely side of the aisle I think the much larger and tangible risk is a major disruption in the oil market, such as a Saudi rebellion or civil war. Climate change is a secondary issue which can be handled with some energy system changes, adaptation, and geoengineering

Friday got an oil change and an inspection. The car is still in good condition but there is a developing issue I intend to avoid by buying a new(er) car next year. I can’t decide on what I want though. The cause of much of my life’s struggle is analysis paralysis.

Currently in Malta I can meet you for 10 minutes. There are many facts that are absent from your government on the issue of immigration and oil smuggling.
5000 2018-07-08 19:39:20 Wasn't dark of night unless you had a bag over your head. I remember why they gave them their own money back. Nothing hidden. However, The art of the deal is Trump gets 19% of Rosneft Russian state oil co. for lifting sanctions. It lines 45's pocket.
5001 2018-07-08 19:39:19 and change the oil on the goddamn car when we get back from the strip club!
5002 2018-07-08 19:39:18 ;-) i knew that was ur moroccan oil shampoo

5004 2018-07-08 19:39:03 My husband made a mixture of white vinegar and olive oil mixed together in a blender
5005 2018-07-08 19:39:01 Yeah eucalyptus, peppermint, and lemongrass essential oil mixed together works like a charm. I’ve hardly had any mosquito bites this summer. Normally I’m covered in them

5034 2018-07-08 19:35:09 Now, by contrast, my colleagues working for the oil industry have lots of money and all the coolest equipment. Wonder why that is? (Not really)
5035 2018-07-08 19:35:06 Ladies ok ok men too you wanna get a awwwww reaction from your significant other get some hot stones & lotion or oil and massage the bottom of their feet!!!! OMG that feels absolutely hands down AMAZING!!!!! #inlalaland #OMGossshhhhh

5039 2018-07-08 19:34:29 That's fine a lot do assume, there are a few of us lady investors on here.
5040 2018-07-08 19:34:26 But you are good with oil companies getting billions per year just for existing right?
5041 2018-07-08 19:34:23 Since when did @elfcosmetics stop selling the oil blot sheets ? Those were the best and great price too
5042 2018-07-08 19:34:04 i just used coconut oil to take my makeup off bc i ran out of my usual stuff and i fORGOT IM ALLERGIC TO IT

5045 2018-07-08 19:33:30 I love the look in a boomer's eye and that cute shudder that travels down its spine when I whisper "I prefer healthcare and education to war and oil subsidies"
5046 2018-07-08 19:33:29 Burn the midnight oil bro hahaha 
5047 2018-07-08 19:33:19 Ke olive oil.
5048 2018-07-08 19:33:12 Try a teaspoon of olive oil in your water and a table spoon of salt. After it comes to a full rolling boil bring the heat down and cook down the water. Should help some
5049 2018-07-08 19:33:11 Get yourself a good can of two-layer sardines in olive oil.  Minimal risk of mercury, etc.
5050 2018-07-08 19:33:09 Why is it the right wing like dirty air? or is it just that they like rich oil barons?
5051 2018-07-08 19:33:08 Maybe it’s me, but can someone help me understand what this tweet means. Cigarettes = Oil. Air pollution? Are tobacco industries shipping food and other materials now? Does smoking cure cancer? 
5052 2018-07-08 19:33:03 J'aimerais que Mr Oil reparte d'où il vient. Twitter etait mieux sans lui.
5053 2018-07-08 19:32:49 Oil gets subsidies, but the for profit prisons that we are paying millions to house the stolen babies had to bribe POTUS first.  A little something for the effort Padre.
5054 2018-07-08 19:32:49 The Scottish govt 'seeing'the UKs 2040 and (predictably) 'raising it' to 2030 on a diesel/petrol ban ...... While STILL baking in oil numbers to their SGC report (this despite saying mad numbers were baked into 2014) is a *mad* we have a name for:

 Schizophrenia.......
5055 2018-07-08 19:32:36 If you want to know how your boyfriend/husband feels when you ask him to get make up or tampons, go get oil and an oil filter for him. 

I swear I stared at the shelves for 20 minutes trying to figure out which 5w-30 and S2808 oil filter I should get. 
5056 2018-07-08 19:32:22 might chug a bottle of olive oil, idk
5057 2018-07-08 19:32:19 Still just bewildered that we as a society once called something “rapeseed” and had “rapeseed oil”. 

How the fuck do you even get to naming something that?

5065 2018-07-08 19:31:22 Due to the exponential increase of the human population, palm oil plantations need to be set up at the cost of the destruction of virgin forests and these few remaining Orangutan, becoming "no-habitat" exiles.

5074 2018-07-08 19:29:28 this is hella true my dad was ij the army for ten years and to this day says he learned how crooked the government is/was. he fought in desert storm to look for “weapons of mass destruction” he learned that it was a disguise for a reason to steal oil and push dominance lmaoo

5079 2018-07-08 19:28:33 Also: Griddled baby gem, peas, fresh mint oil and burata. Not so much a salad but light, cool and fresh.
5080 2018-07-08 19:28:32 And on the other side is the oil & gas biz that literally rake in billions in profit.

Analyzing who profits is good critical thinking...but if you conclude the low paid public scientist is the one profiting compared to the oil & gas biz, then you failed at critical thinking.
5081 2018-07-08 19:28:26 Palm oil is unsustainable and destructive to animals and humans full stop, why not choose another healthier less destructive option altogether?
5082 2018-07-08 19:28:26 Ha ha you should seriously take a look at #Lvcg tiny FF big things coming there every kid loves Lego
5083 2018-07-08 19:28:24 @DollarShaveClub what happened to preshave oil?

5089 2018-07-08 19:27:40 I’ve been putting coconut oil and aloe Vera on my face and omg it feels so smooth like a baby’s butt lol
5090 2018-07-08 19:27:32 The moral is that you’re already prepared with your questions like the women with oil in their lamps. Well done my faithful servant sister.
5091 2018-07-08 19:27:29 i ran out of olive oil and am using the same coconut oil that i use to moisturize my body to cook my meals. donate to the cause—venmo me @rebeccavines
5092 2018-07-08 19:27:29 I had Avocado on toast today, splash of Olive oil and sea salt with some black pepper. Side of Humous #Bringhimhome
5093 2018-07-08 19:27:29 It'll go up in next 3 to 3 yr look back numbers..but the long term trend is  deline and accelerating.

Most oil predictions are nowhere near handling the rapidly changing situation where l govts are bidding up the timetable for the electric changeover.......

5096 2018-07-08 19:27:16 His presidency wasn't perfect, and there were things I certainly disagreed with. But, on the whole, his legacy stands pretty well.  As for selling us to the Saudi's for oil, that may actually have been Nixon.
5097 2018-07-08 19:26:59 Oil check
5098 2018-07-08 19:26:59 @AliYoungBeauty I've ordered the tsv, do I apply the eye treatment before or after the oil and how close to the eye do I go with the oil and does the eye treatment go directly on the eyelid and up to lash line?
5099 2018-07-08 19:26:46 I am on the winning side remember.
It's the liberals who have to convince the massive MAGA party to vote for the left.  This is what your selling so far;
anti-Trump
Anti-MAGA
Kill the Tax Cut law
Open borders, no wall
Pro illegal immigration
Pro carbon tax
Anti-coal/oil
Anti-jobs
5100 2018-07-08 19:26:45 Good advice. Also make sure your doctor, nurse, midwife massages your perineum with olive oil during birth. It reduces the chance of tearing as well, and is great on babys newly exposed skin in the months after birth...

5102 2018-07-08 19:26:24 But @lisamurkowski will vote based on what trump and the GOP offers to give the ppl in Alaska, perhaps a weekly spa visit to all Alaskans? They bought her vote on healthcare with a bill opening up ANWR for oil drilling, pmts shared with alaskans..she has NO integrity!
5103 2018-07-08 19:26:23 @jjz1600 
Considering how polling & statistical analysis have been gamed, historically, to empower the CIA/Oil Cabal by managing populations & manipulating their common sense, I'm pretty sure the mere identification of corrupt practice will fall on deaf ears w/ Zogby.

5110 2018-07-08 19:25:21 Soaked my hair in argan oil and now hunting retreat venues in Morocco again - coincidence? 
5111 2018-07-08 19:24:42 Is it just me or has anyone else noticed besides these senators silence no one from the administration or Republican party is defending their trip to Russia on the 4th of July that was to drop sanctions, and for money and oil.
5112 2018-07-08 19:24:37 Think of the next 15 months, are they  a repeat of 1997-1998 or 2012-2013?

5127 2018-07-08 19:21:07 Most Nigerians are been brain watch. I don't know if this brain washing chemical has been injected into our food, fruits, or vegetable oil.? The way we reason why these days is terrible.
5128 2018-07-08 19:21:03 Went to put sun in in my hair and grabbed tanning oil instead so im not happy
5129 2018-07-08 19:21:01 then you’re fine!! you probably have a normal skin type where you nothing really effects your skin. but there are better alternatives. a lot of people just don’t like the coconut oil hype bc it’s really not the absolute best. there’s other ones that are better!
5130 2018-07-08 19:20:56 Lord I’m sleeping with coconut oil on my face tonight , may I please wake up glowing. 
I’ve got a confrontation tomorrow so I need to look cute when I argue w that bitch.

5132 2018-07-08 19:20:43 Normal sunflower oil perhaps? I havn't tried olive oil.
5133 2018-07-08 19:20:08 AriPaz20 Nutrient rich sweet potatoes plus a little oil. Damned healthy, and a far better snack than what most people consume. Orthorexia is bad.
5134 2018-07-08 19:19:58 Hey guys! Just a reminder that the US uses 12 million barrels of oil just to produce plastic bags! Don’t forget to bring your reusable bags and help reduce the use of plastic!! #PlasticFreeJuly
5135 2018-07-08 19:19:45 people with acne prone skin or oil skin should only use a few drops if they want to add it into their skin care routine or find a lighter oil to mix in like jojoba or rose hip seed oil!

5144 2018-07-08 19:18:39 I found experts to identify best companies ..say multispectral cameras.. then appealed to life saving aspect plus publicity benefit if their tech was successful in well known search. One diverted plane and crew for days from paid oil survey to search for fossett.
5145 2018-07-08 19:18:39 Oil and gas too
5146 2018-07-08 19:18:30 My cousin boyfriend gone change my oil for me, not to mention he had all the shits to wash a car. S/o to him, saving me my moneysssss 
5147 2018-07-08 19:18:25 maybe he will be so distraught he will pour gas all over himself and light a match, after all he is just a flaming asshole ,who was bought and paid for by big oil
5148 2018-07-08 19:18:19 2 hrs. And 20 minutes later my oil is changed.

BIG OIL AND GAS were financing and giving birth to climate change denial

Get out of your mental disneyland !
5159 2018-07-08 19:16:54 Nothing like dumping corn syrup solids, trans fat oil, sodium caseinate, and dipotassium phosphate into one's morning coffee. Not to mention that sourcing palm oil spawns deforestation, habitat degradation, climate change, animal cruelty and indigenous rights abuses.
5160 2018-07-08 19:16:45 got you! in a tweet she said that oils clog your pores, but not all oils soak into the skin some stay on the surface. but the reason people should stay away from coconut oil is bc it is one of the oils that can clog your pores and break you out really badly!

5176 2018-07-08 19:14:45 I remember the summer of ‘78. Everyone was poor (pre recession inflation) and there was no gas for the car because of the oil crises. Of course being 7, I didn’t know why we were poor and the car wouldn’t go.
5177 2018-07-08 19:14:34 I’m needing an oil change soon!
5178 2018-07-08 19:14:14 No, virgin coconut oil is a solid. It melts around body temperature

5180 2018-07-08 19:13:34 Oil change Ranger style?
5181 2018-07-08 19:13:20 It's more connected to the dwindling oil supply & the inability of our leaders to hold the oil industry accountable for their responsibility in making us unprepared for the coming crisis it will lead to.

5192 2018-07-08 19:11:45 The oil industry has literally ADMITTED that they knew about global warming from their OWN research back in the 70's, but kept their knowledge hidden to protect their business model. So if you really don't believe in climate change,  take it up with Shell, because they do.

5194 2018-07-08 19:11:38 The TransMountain pipeline is a huge waste of money and resources on old energy when at the G7 the PM promised to get out of oil by 2050 that is in just 30 yrs/ and at the same time the project is touted to pay for itself in 40 yrs.

5206 2018-07-08 19:10:38 Only thing that will slowdown oil price will be reduction in demand IMO. Worldwide demand fundamentals are driving this increase coupled with Permian pipeline constraints, supply issues in certain OPEC countries like Venezuela and Iran, among other issues affecting supply/demand

They sure dont make them like that anymore.

Just keep oil in that slant6 motor & it just kept going.
5209 2018-07-08 19:10:07 All your points are factually FALSE, let’s see:
1. The agreement expired, it wasn’t renewed.

5248 2018-07-08 19:02:24 My unscientific observation is that leaderless organizations respond to existential threats. Just speculating, but NPR fears for its existence because of what happened to EPA. Personally, I do not fear the sudden demise of big oil.

5255 2018-07-08 19:01:36 Water is Wales’ oil/gold/zinc/iron. It is ours. We should have complete control over our water. Sell it at an oil like price to those nations that can afford it but ensure we export it to third world countries free. The rich should defend the poor.

Food that is strongly coloured, acidic or oily e.g. red wine, lemon juice and cooking oil can stain the surface. 

Clean any such spillages as soon as they occur.

5258 2018-07-08 19:01:18 It's not just tax, and we have to consider the wider implications of the term "worth". Obviously things like mineral rights (inc oil, coal, gas), fresh water, land (a lot of that is *not* in Scottish hands), fish stocks, renewable energy potential,  etc etc.
5259 2018-07-08 19:00:58  or something like "the difference is the oil,  the oil is the difference " kolo!

5268 2018-07-08 19:00:01 I never go shopping with my husband. Well, I shouldn't say never. I rarely shop with him and if it happens we do shop together, half the time we split up and agree to meet back somewhere at a specific place, otherwise it's not fun for either of us.
5269 2018-07-08 18:59:56 I read the oil pessimists are forcasting 150 a barrel if anything goes awry. Gee seems like the kingdom and Putin would love that infusion of cash. 

Oh BTW guess who is selling all those soybeans to china now? Yep, russian farmers. trump just can't help putun enough. Almost like
5270 2018-07-08 18:59:52 I had a whole week of intersex appropriation from TRAs with snake oil science.

5272 2018-07-08 18:59:22 I make an avocado chocolate pudding with CBD oil added (we’re not fully legal in Fl, yet) It’s really good & I don’t get the sugar crash after cuz the fats and fibers in the avocado slow the glycemic spike.

5277 2018-07-08 18:58:12 Evan. Is this about Trump wanting a piece of Putin’s oil?  Drilling in the arctic?  We get no oil from Iran and Trump will drop sanctions and make money and import oil from Russia?  I need to figure this out.  Money & power is always the motive
5278 2018-07-08 18:58:08 @gretchenrubin So disappointed to hear Dr. Oz advertising on Happier podcast. He hawks snake oil! It really isn't compatible with the research-based ethic of Happier.

5289 2018-07-08 18:56:24 This is about selling oil to Asia @sjmuir , nothing more. If you’re lobbying for it, you must be benefiting by it.
5290 2018-07-08 18:56:13 Forgot oil pulling, but I guess that doesn't allow for product placement. 
5291 2018-07-08 18:55:49 No bf loving next wkend. I need to get my hair done, oil change and go see my brother.
5292 2018-07-08 18:55:39 And GOVT wants taxes and taxes and taxes ! You must remember when the crude oil reached all time low - the common citizens at that time also did not get respite , understood smarty pants  ?
5293 2018-07-08 18:55:34 I will never understand why ppl use public forums to get terms themselves into trouble. I work for an oil company and if I was saying embarrassing stuff and they found out, I would accept responsibility. That's why i stick to games & sports on twitter

5298 2018-07-08 18:55:14 Truth is like oil no matter how much water you pour it will always float.

5300 2018-07-08 18:54:53 I got some smooth shit. But I have so much cologne and I don’t wear it anymore cuz I started with the oil some time back.
5301 2018-07-08 18:54:28 Compromised & beholden. Like many Reps & Dems in red states are beholden to big money donors & Trump supporters. One stray move & they’ll be replaced. Jefferson was to the slaveocracy as Bush was to big oil.

5305 2018-07-08 18:54:16 This can happen for oil but for a short time period. Even the ERC will not allow for the whole market to sell at a loss even if the market has knowledge of a price drop
5306 2018-07-08 18:54:02 idk it’s jus weird to me To not have the water clear before cooking it... and not for me since I put the rice in the water and boil it then later put in the oil I guess it’s all about dif traditions and how u cook it LOL
5307 2018-07-08 18:53:57 Wasn’t the first oil of Saudi Arabia discovered by the Americans in 1938? And used to be a subcontinent of Asia? Please excuse my ignorance it’s not somewhere I know much about. :)

5309 2018-07-08 18:53:24 Is it natural oil? Where is the outlet?
5310 2018-07-08 18:52:59 Best advice for college students: do the random jobs you don’t expect to enjoy. If you’d have told me last year that I’d be spending my Sunday afternoon cutting up 8 lbs of coconut oil to make soap and having the time of my life, I’d say somethings wrong with you, but here we are

5322 2018-07-08 18:51:44 "Ok, but only if you go and buy me tissues, baby oil, and a cucumber" and remain serious while searching for change in your wallet.
5323 2018-07-08 18:51:25 Thanks! I got back into oil lately but at wrong time, got spooked and got out again. Too risky for me now. I also have conflicts but thats just me. Actually the BofA stock I got in recession doing very well lol. Just glad I'm not poor anymore. Currently haha.

5342 2018-07-08 18:49:03 No. The EU hasn't stood with us on our Russian sanctions (check out how much LPG and oil they get from Russia)- and have nearly single-handedly propped up Russia's fuel sector. The EU is incapable of standing with us and often stands in our way and tries to screw us- like always.
5343 2018-07-08 18:49:02 Headache & im out of tea tree oil 
5344 2018-07-08 18:48:49 A woman enlightened me about being able to get your vagina high so I looked it up and basically....i need dealers who sell Foria oil to make themselves known ASAP
5345 2018-07-08 18:48:45 Is that a ten gallon oil barron hat?
5346 2018-07-08 18:48:44 "Big Oil" spends more money on alternative energy research than the federal govt ever did, even under Obama. They know what consumers want & they'll deliver it w/o wasting taxpayer $. Your 60yo letter is moot at this point, but you can change your personal energy consumption.
5347 2018-07-08 18:48:36 Standard home-alone dinner: sauteed whatever-vegetables-were-sitting-in-the-fridge, and baked potatoes with olive oil and hot sauce.
5348 2018-07-08 18:48:29 Well because every time you would hit me up to hang out, it would be like 2 in the morning when I’m already showered, in bed with my coconut oil on lol. After all that, I ain’t leaving the house  matter of fact, I ain’t leaving the house at 2 am 
5349 2018-07-08 18:48:26 "She's relaxing for a bit really. I went with her and Hina to get donuts the other day."
5350 2018-07-08 18:48:25 I hate coconut oil for my hair , black castor oil is where it’s at 
5351 2018-07-08 18:47:09 “Don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears
And I dry them with my hair
You weren't there the night He found me
You did not feel what I felt
When He wrapped His loving arms around me
And you don't know the cost
Of the oil in my Alabaster box...” 
5352 2018-07-08 18:47:08 I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)

LOL
5353 2018-07-08 18:47:06 The entire world knows why AR is in the economic situation.  By the way AZ with all its oil wealth and open borders has a GDP per capital that is only 8% higher than what you call a poor AR and rich AZ.
5354 2018-07-08 18:47:06 The best sunscreen is olive oil. Rub your kids with olive oil on the beach.

5356 2018-07-08 18:47:01 He was far ahead of everyone else in lobbying on behalf of the regime way before Trita started his internship in the US and collected millions in donations from the oil companies. He was specially influential on the Republicans and had some access to the Bush adm
5357 2018-07-08 18:46:59 "an oil model? Well, you certainly do your job well! I think I might just buy that type of oil... " ^\\\^
5358 2018-07-08 18:46:56 in my household there'll always be Castor Oil or Mist Alba .. sebedisa your mala and respect us smh
5359 2018-07-08 18:46:13 Mexican incoming president proposes to address problems driving migrants.  Read more Aid. Dont be surprised if extortion tactics are used, just like Turkey is doing to EU. Pay or else the floodgates will be opened up.
5360 2018-07-08 18:46:03 Not that brand but was small tubs of coconut oil. But doesn't protect like sun cream but skin goes very brown
5361 2018-07-08 18:45:57 "Yeah. I was actually going to see Sonia for a bit."

5363 2018-07-08 18:45:47 pregnant mom is spraying some kind of essential oil that smells like menthol and the ENTIRE building smells like it. its giving me a headache
5364 2018-07-08 18:45:42 I gather the box on it is particularly tight till the oil warms it up. 
They also get very thirsty for fuel, but luckily really easy to fill them up, sometimes too quick.
5365 2018-07-08 18:45:38 The art of the deal is Trump gets 19% of Rosneft Russian state oil co. for lifting sanctions. It lines 45's pocket.
5366 2018-07-08 18:45:30 Things to do tomorrow: Gym, change oil my baby and piano practice... No-work-Mondays is the best way to kick-off the week... 
5367 2018-07-08 18:45:27 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Canada has no problems compared to the US..all Canada has to do is cut of oil , steel and aluminum, lumber exports  to the US..watch the US economy struggle. The US cannot meet it's own raw resourse needs.
5368 2018-07-08 18:45:22 Biotin 5000 mg and a table spoon of coconut oil a day
5369 2018-07-08 18:45:06 I was at Walmart yesterday getting oil for my car and while I was walking some dude yelled “QUIT COCKBLOCKING ME!” really loud to his friend and I nearly busted out laughing I was so caught off guard by that
5370 2018-07-08 18:44:53 Pachuli oil and body Oder. It amazes me how ignorant people are.  But I guess if you don’t work and pay taxes you don’t care where my tax dollars go.
5371 2018-07-08 18:44:52 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
5372 2018-07-08 18:44:24 #WR: Iran is trying to build a good link with EU to protect itself against US. @Reuters wrote “Iran says it needs more help from Europe to keep alive an agreement with world powers to curb its nuclear program. Washington has ordered all countries to stop buying Iranian oil...”
5373 2018-07-08 18:44:24 Only Cbd oil...but that may change. My state is in the process of getting medical marijuana up and going.
5374 2018-07-08 18:44:17 I've never understood why women want men there. I prefer to go by myself or with friends.
5375 2018-07-08 18:44:09 The art of the deal is Trump gets 19% of Rosneft Russian state oil co. for lifting sanctions. It lines 45's pocket.
5376 2018-07-08 18:44:06 Ok then, more oil for me I guess. Have fun driving your Prius.
5377 2018-07-08 18:43:53 Haha okay but I won't use Johnson's baby oil that was made for babies

5380 2018-07-08 18:43:13 In 2018 alone, the double hulled #sanchi burned and sank south of Japan and then there was the spill and fire in Borneo in early April... but if you think selling oil to Asia is worth it for it to happen here, keep lobbying for it @sjmuir !
5381 2018-07-08 18:43:11 And noone said to over mediciate, they said not to trust naturopathy which promotes debunked nonsense like homeopathy, the exact opposite of over medicating, cos you are lucky to get a molecule of anything but water and sugar from it. Over priced water/ sugar pills. snake oil.

5383 2018-07-08 18:42:59 Canadians are entitled to Best Life on the earth, just because of their Natural Resources Richness.
Be reminded protagonists of Obstructionism, Alberta Oil Operations are cleanest in the world.
5384 2018-07-08 18:42:52 See this one. Why? So oil the spoilers you’ve seen didn’t spoil it for you - it’s my not watching that’s the main spoiler?
5385 2018-07-08 18:42:34 Pure propaganda
5386 2018-07-08 18:42:29 I’d go for a fan spitting oil from the bearings? Either way it’s best to keep it turned off. :-)
5387 2018-07-08 18:42:13 I ran out of oil :) They seem to be doing ok. Non-wheat flour which I think is preventing them from puffing up. I have a leftover vegetable curry to go alongside.
5388 2018-07-08 18:42:12 She let go as well.
5389 2018-07-08 18:42:11 Agora tá tocando uma música gospel chupinhada de Midnight Oil.
5390 2018-07-08 18:42:07 Oil money? NRA money? There is no other reason for this contemptible boot licking.
5391 2018-07-08 18:42:03 American citizens dont have a right to an attorney in civil court. I still know of no cases where children are tried without a parent or guardian. A minor could not enter a plea, or a contract if you like, with the court.
5392 2018-07-08 18:41:53 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
5393 2018-07-08 18:41:53 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5394 2018-07-08 18:41:31 Hi Gertrude. Your pizza with green pepper and motor oil will be delivered in 28 min via air balloon.
5395 2018-07-08 18:41:24 Internet: Eating two pieces of pizza is equivalent to swallowing 3 tablespoons of oil

Me: Goes on my break and B lines it to the cafeteria for pizza
5396 2018-07-08 18:41:13 ^retinol serum and rosehip oil!!!
5397 2018-07-08 18:40:55 It's hi time to realize that countries like malsysia will never cooperate with us - and never extradite criminals; we should cut our dependence on Palm oil - a product thrust on innocent people by pure marketing gimmicks;that's where it will hurt them
5398 2018-07-08 18:40:55 Lol will pray for it. Do u prefer to use water or oil anoint.
5399 2018-07-08 18:40:53 The way mom used to do this was with a lot more oil. Like a few inches worth. What did you make to have with it?
5400 2018-07-08 18:40:44 Daghighan. This guy is a genius though. He probably has financial ties with the Sepah and he may even be actually doing the bidding of global oil companies. He is a mercenary fro oil companies.
5401 2018-07-08 18:40:33 Please don't tell me you like that hippie cologne oil called patchouli oil
5402 2018-07-08 18:40:22 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
5403 2018-07-08 18:40:22 Sewing does not constitute marriage material! How well does she was your car!? How often does she clean the gutters!? How quickly does she get the oil change on your car done!? These are the questions you need to answer when finding a mate.
5404 2018-07-08 18:40:21 That’s right Evangelicals...Trump knows better than God what babies should drink.  We were probably one kickback away from declaring that babies should drink crude oil.
5405 2018-07-08 18:40:19 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

5407 2018-07-08 18:40:06 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
5408 2018-07-08 18:39:59 @33yearsaslave Hi there sorry for the late reply you asked about how to cook tofu The easiest way I do it is gently press as much water out as possible and cut into cubes. I add some seasonings and a tiny bit of oil and then 2 tbs of corn flour and coat the pieces well.
5409 2018-07-08 18:39:56 Listen Doug, u got my vote in recent provincial election with just one claim: No, not with the 10-cent drop in gas prices. The oil barons will just raise their prices by 10 cents. Not even with ur promise to cut taxes. When u cut taxes, another cut elsewhere is needed to make up.
5410 2018-07-08 18:39:53 Neem oil I’ve heard that’s a very good garden friend I’m going to get some have you used it before 
5411 2018-07-08 18:39:49 Leaning towards to the facts is not "bias",it's presenting reality.This "debate" has been settled in legitimate scientific communities decades ago. The only reason it continues is b/c the right is being paid by companies to deny its existence & prevent regulations of big oil etc.
5412 2018-07-08 18:39:45 Bruce Lee once said that every time The Donald spews nonsense, a depressed snail dies a slow emotional death
5413 2018-07-08 18:39:38 Me too. The whole group is as slimy as an oil spill.
5414 2018-07-08 18:39:33 Oil spills from tar sands are occurring in Iowa. A mess! Ppl downriver drink this water. Its toxic, animals, ppl are going to get sick.
Not a word in the press. The rich & greedy are killing this country. This Earth.

5416 2018-07-08 18:39:22 Digby-Jones! Can Scotland have its £325 billion back in oil revenues? By the way, who have I been paying my taxes to for the past forty years? Hey! Digby-Jones! Is it true that the UK is £2 trillion in debt?
5417 2018-07-08 18:39:11 I just wanted to let all the men who see this know that last week I bought lavender oil for myself and that it's not going to go by itself. My DMs are open.
5418 2018-07-08 18:39:04 You think you own whatever land you land and earth is just a dead thing you can claim.  How about just break dependence on oil with new technology?
5419 2018-07-08 18:39:02 okay the only products i started using is the rosken oil & maybelline fit me foundation so it's either the two of them i guess .. hopefully la since cleanser dah second bottle tkde breakout ke apa before ni
5420 2018-07-08 18:38:44 Health policy consultants promoted managed care and HMOs, with all their snake oil promises of coordinating and optimizing care which is a lie and fraud. Politico reporters should cover the false promises by the hypsters and hucksters who got rich telling lies about "care."

5422 2018-07-08 18:38:33 Heck, I think you are both right.
The Russians do what they've always done ... except this time, they've gotten support from some folks that decided that they liked the Russians and their oil, more than they like Democrats.
The Union is swirling away in solvent.
5423 2018-07-08 18:38:22 Some days, you just need that vat of boiling oil, archers and a small castle...

Amirite?!
5424 2018-07-08 18:38:17 Good! Piece of shit. They are talking about him here in Oklahoma running for office. Apparently the oil Barrons in this state think he is a great guy.
5425 2018-07-08 18:38:17 potatoes, chopped green chilis, chopped red onions, capers, chopped black olives with some salt/pepper/oil/vinegar mix on top is just a wonderful mix.
5426 2018-07-08 18:38:01 I always loved them boiled in salty water, chilled, and served as a salad with salt, oil, and lemon.  Broccoli and spinach are absolutely delicious this way.

Broccoli Rabe boiled in salty water, chilled, water squeezed out, tossed with salt and olive oil, on bread, is heaven.

5429 2018-07-08 18:37:49 And to pick me up some oil for my car, schedule my doctor appointment, etc. Is this not a great idea?

5432 2018-07-08 18:36:58 And most of the regulations that the EPA got rid of under Pruitt were designed to ease  the burden on big oil and energy corporations so that they could have carts Blanche to pollute the planet and reap the profits.
5433 2018-07-08 18:36:51 I'm thinking flea beetles.  Apparently, they don't like soapy water or neem oil. I enjoyed spraying with garlic water though: pre-flavoured veggies!
5434 2018-07-08 18:36:35 I'm getting my oil changed.  I forgot my earbuds.  And the manager just caught me playing with snap chat flitters...  My life. #oilchange #nooneishere #boring

5437 2018-07-08 18:35:44 You have a miscomprehension and incivility problem. Snake oil salesmen don't believe their product cures the ills they say it does, but that doesn't stop them from selling their product to cheat the suckers. @algore is cynically profiteering from a lie he doesn't believe. Get it?
5438 2018-07-08 18:35:41 If I’m going to continue to apply coconut oil in the shower I need to buy a shower mat. I almost lose my life everyday.

5441 2018-07-08 18:34:52 Neera blocked me over a year ago for calling out her email regarding Libyan oil. She and the rest of the Democratic strategy elite act out this incredible farce where they deny Wikileaks, while acknowledging the content therein. They know they've been caught, but won't cop to it.
5442 2018-07-08 18:34:43 My first 3 acts as President would be:
-Sell Hollywood to Mexico then build a huge wall around it
-Deporting Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi 
-Putting Antifa and any Hollywood stars who promote violence and anti-American rhetoric on a desert island.
5443 2018-07-08 18:34:42 Climate change is real.  The only people denying it are morons, and people invested financially in the fossil fuel industry.  We have a responsibility to our children to do everything in our power to stop climate change.  

Get rid of politicians owned by oil/coal businesses.

5445 2018-07-08 18:34:24 Trump has taken many actions that harm Russia (like persuading the Saudis to increase oil output). You leftists have not been paying attention. Pay attention to what Trump does, not what he says.

5448 2018-07-08 18:34:03 Think how much Scotland would gain if independent? 
Non payment towards Westminster services, 
Funds from Oil and gas, water, plus tax from companies extracting it, instead of tax cuts. Shout all you want Scotland is rich enough, trouble is, is England?
5449 2018-07-08 18:33:50 Calgarians don’t want any Liberals or NDP they just tax everything and send the oil & gas jobs into a recession! Times up vote Conservative!

5453 2018-07-08 18:33:08 Nifty laundry trick for those who love essential oils:  add drops of your favorite essential oil to your laundry detergent and/or to a small cloth you add to the dryer when you dry your laundry.
5454 2018-07-08 18:32:48 I flushed a bottle of coconut oil down the toilet today. How’s your Sunday?
5455 2018-07-08 18:32:17 because of their high oil / fat content, you can use crushed up peanuts as a lubricant in difficult machinery
5456 2018-07-08 18:31:46 Canola oil too. Motor grade rapeseed oil.  Terrible stuff!
5457 2018-07-08 18:31:40 Very important oil and big biz interests most probably want the Mueller investigation shut down then. I don't want to sound conspiratorial but if Mueller comes up with nothing or he gets shut down, that will be too coinkydinky for me. And I don't know where we would go from there
5458 2018-07-08 18:31:31 get a portable electric griddle...follow instructions on back of pancake mix box or recipe, use butter not oil and you'll have pancakes in 30 minutes :) :)

5461 2018-07-08 18:30:49 OT, but hope you do have a chance to go on Joe Rogan, (& Oprah &...).  It will be helpful if the world sees you without the funhouse mirror of people with massive oil/$ habits tossing fake nonsense all over your public image via pay-to-play media

5469 2018-07-08 18:29:52 Attention you numpty! I have paid my way since I was 16 years old- just like the rest of my fellow Scots. Our oil has been used by WM for years- we pay our way and then some. We can't wait to be independent and we won't look back

5476 2018-07-08 18:29:05 Castor oil para sa nasunog ko pilik mata. 
 Kaya ayaw ko gumamit ng mumurahing lighter eh. *wow!* Pahamak yung may adjustment. Hahahaha!

PARADOJA la 3a guerra se precipita,hasta fin mataràn, acà y allà
5478 2018-07-08 18:27:59 I ran out of my fav cologne oil man. I thought I had a back up 
5479 2018-07-08 18:27:49 Maybe oil production ramps up and our small car gm and ancillary jobs lay off the rest of these murder culture gangs. Not needed.
5480 2018-07-08 18:27:48 I'm curious: How do you measure your inflammation to say it's under control with cannabis oil?
5481 2018-07-08 18:27:35 Where do they get this garbage?? Been hearing this since 2014.
They steal our oil, our water...all rubbish.
5482 2018-07-08 18:27:27 #WeThePeople need to take back this country and elevate it to what we've branded it to be, a beacon of hope. We need to end senseless wars, reliance on oil, corruption and get our priorities & shit straight. People & country above greed & ignorance.
5483 2018-07-08 18:27:18 Relax.  Trump called Saudis and told them to cut oil prices.  The cuts should be taking place any year now.  It’s handled!  MAGA!
5484 2018-07-08 18:27:13 Oil Slick eyeshadow back in the early 2000s xx
5485 2018-07-08 18:26:38 I'll run your PAC.
5486 2018-07-08 18:26:32 lol I did a hot oil treatment once and burned the hell outta my scalp and haven’t did one since but Im all ears for tips
5487 2018-07-08 18:26:20 somebody oil my scalp
5488 2018-07-08 18:25:56 Trump covets Putin's absolute power and riches. Sadly, Trump lacks the intelligence required to dictate as forcefully as Putin, no matter how much dirty RUS oil $$ he collects and no matter how complicit his administration is. To lift RUS sanctions would be absolute madness.
5489 2018-07-08 18:25:55 You mean Romeo Blue, not Lenny Kravitz.

You don't get to change your name to Romeo Blue and THEN change back.

Also, repeating the same line over and over again, does not make a song (see "Are you gunna go my way", "Fly away, fly away...")
5490 2018-07-08 18:25:53 #LeaveNoTrace  That said, @Interior @BLMNational @SecretaryZinke @GOP are responsible for selling/leasing our public lands to oil/gas/mining which is far more destructive and criminal, IMHO.
5491 2018-07-08 18:25:43 Message from a cool, dark sanctuary somewhere in E7/E12: So sorry to have missed it! Hot weather & me are like oil & water - we just don’t mix!!
5492 2018-07-08 18:25:39 Wait, I don't see 'invade Baja California' anywhere. This list is bullsh*t.
5493 2018-07-08 18:25:35 Lemon rind, lemon juice, garlic mashed up, olive oil and parsley on chicken thighs all day then BBQ is delishus.
5494 2018-07-08 18:25:14 Git the palm oil reet intya
5495 2018-07-08 18:25:11 dont u have some wild growth oil to be rubbing in ya scalp
5496 2018-07-08 18:25:02 A surge in electric vehicles is coming the next few years. How big a threat is this to the oil industry? #OPEC, #OOTT
5497 2018-07-08 18:25:01 I practiced a few times. Along with stuff like checking the oil. When I got my license my grandfather (who never took an interest in me before or since) had me practice changing tires until I could do it efficiently. 
But yeah, I have forgotten because I’m 40 now.
5498 2018-07-08 18:24:53 just ordered @chrissyteigen x Becca Cosmetics sunset glow body oil - one for me and one for my kit, because i already know i'm about to be obsessed 
5499 2018-07-08 18:24:46 Have you tried linseed oil to help with skin. The omega 3 anti inflammatory helped my horse as well as I used to wash him off in medivet
5500 2018-07-08 18:24:42 my mom ordered cbd oil so every day i ask her if her weed juice came in yet
5501 2018-07-08 18:24:40 “thirst for profit that surreptitiously exploits oil and gas fields without regard for our common home, with no scruples about the fact that the energy market now dictates the law of co-existence among peoples.”
5502 2018-07-08 18:24:39 Ban import of palm.oil from Malaysia. It is anyway very bad for environment and ecology. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @sureshpprabhu @RadhamohanBJP @drharshvardhan
5503 2018-07-08 18:24:32 Me and my cousin were trying to tan at the beach so we put a bunch of tanning oil on and now I’m soooo dark 
5504 2018-07-08 18:24:24 Oil and water never mix.
5505 2018-07-08 18:24:21 Girl you need kiehls ultra facial oil free cream it is the bomb the best I’ve ever tried!
5506 2018-07-08 18:24:17 Well... actually you can get one with a Diesel engine... then switch your fuel system over to vegetable oil and pick up your fuel free from local businesses... I think it’s better for the environment that way too...
5507 2018-07-08 18:24:05 Then you get a oromo mind which can’t classify oil and water.
Shut your mouth up and don’t argue with me . Poor Ethiopian can’t argue with somali person shit oromo
5508 2018-07-08 18:24:02 To  the oil companies it's not a subsidy, it's money they are entitled to as a thank you from their employees aka politicians.
5509 2018-07-08 18:23:58 1.9 billion to house 119 thousand captured illegals. 
A wall would cut down on that number alone.
5510 2018-07-08 18:23:52 Why did God institute tithe? He did it so that the Levites that never got lands can still feed. There's no need for tithing today. tithing was one of the old laws that Jesus death and resurrection abolished. Yet today's pastors preach it because it's their own oil well.
5511 2018-07-08 18:23:50 I’m finally getting an oil change after driving 5,000 miles over 
5512 2018-07-08 18:23:22 Rinse your hair in rice water, do a hot oil treatment with castor oil, it’s plenty of things I can tell you lol
5513 2018-07-08 18:23:18 schizofrenia nie mniejsza jak tankowanie na Orlenie i wspieranie rosyjskiego państwowego koncernu Rosnieft Oil Company.
5514 2018-07-08 18:23:09 It was so hot in my room yesterday that my jar of coconut oil completely melted
5515 2018-07-08 18:23:05 OT, but hope you do have a chance to go on Joe Rogan, (& Oprah &...).  It will be helpful if the world sees you without the funhouse mirror of people with massive oil/$ habits tossing fake nonsense all over your public image via pay-to-play media
5516 2018-07-08 18:22:59 Is this an add sponsored by OIL INDUSTRY?
5517 2018-07-08 18:22:44 Bc large welfare states bring their own problems even when propped up by sovereign oil funds.
5518 2018-07-08 18:22:37 I use @kyletwebster Photoshop brushes, mainly the 'ultimate oil flat wonky' brush,  they are great to use. 
5519 2018-07-08 18:22:36 I just spent $106 at Walmart  $36 for an oil change and the rest on swimsuits and shorts that o found waiting for my car to be done someone please take my debit card away before I’m a broke bitch again
5520 2018-07-08 18:22:25 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
5521 2018-07-08 18:22:10 @realDonaldTrump what about oil prices Mr President?
5522 2018-07-08 18:22:06 I've been trying to take better care of it bc I've never had it this long before, I found out that dandruff shampoo/conditioner is really good for reducing oil though the conditioner is only like every other day or so? and I've been not blow drying or towel drying it much
5523 2018-07-08 18:21:50 It’s out of @chrissyteigen book. But, soy sauce, worchestier, mustard, garlic, red pepper flakes, sugar, basil, lemon, olive oil,pepper.
5524 2018-07-08 18:21:48 Time to siphon some of the extraneous oil I put in the lawnmower last weekend.
5525 2018-07-08 18:21:40 طبعا طبعا وزي ما انت عارف oil and alcohol don't mix 
5526 2018-07-08 18:21:37 Comparing Norway to Canada is a Norwegian red herring.
Completely different tax regimes and oil play types with different pay out times and capital investment numbers.
Apples and Oranges.
5527 2018-07-08 18:21:29 I actually have some cinnamon oil.  You just put it right on the bites?  I tried rubbing with lemon wedges. Kinda worked.
5528 2018-07-08 18:21:27 Pretty much, yes.

As long as you’re safe around the hot oil!
5529 2018-07-08 18:21:22 Now I just need some damn coconut oil
5530 2018-07-08 18:21:07 My mom gets very bad headaches and migraines very often- have you tried excedrin migraine or peppermint oil on your temples? Even just squashing your head with a pillow can help. I hope you get to feeling better soon. 
5531 2018-07-08 18:20:38 Stinky is up and running with front brake pads decontaminated from fork oil

5532 2018-07-08 18:20:36 To provide for those who grieve in Zion-- to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, & a garment of praise for of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for his splendor.

5533 2018-07-08 18:20:15 Every time a Socialist is confronted on this, the answer is, it just hasn't been perfected yet. 
I prefer to be left out of that process. #justsayno
5534 2018-07-08 18:20:03 Yes, and the capital of Israel is Jerusalem, damn it! So, like instead of cooperation, we are spreading dissension because Turkey even sold oil for ISIS, but we don't believe in pictures 'round these parts.
5535 2018-07-08 18:19:49 Interestingly,  some supposed eco friendly groups operating here in Canada are funded by U.S. big oil.
5536 2018-07-08 18:19:39 face oils + essential oil: roseship + jojoba (kleveru) & grapeseed + tea tree oil (purivera)
moisturizer: sukin yg oil control
5537 2018-07-08 18:19:28 Basically you sub out the oil for mayo. It makes it really rich and moist.
5538 2018-07-08 18:19:25 Heard you like oil pressure. I'm gonna guess this is beyond a snake oil fix. Hopefully case vacuum will keep your engine bay clean.
5539 2018-07-08 18:19:24 Her parents were probably like “drive carefully! Don’t park it somewhere were it will get scratched, don’t smoke in it, check the oil before you leave” and she was probably like “YES DAD! ”. And now she has a flat tire.

5543 2018-07-08 18:18:41 South Sudan may not need it too.Bashir helped broker the cease-fire and offered to secure rehabilitation the oil infrastructure in SSD so Port Sudan can resume business
5544 2018-07-08 18:18:37 My concern is the harm to the young confused. You can see it as an intellectual argument, but the harm is real and now. Girls are turning to oil snake sellers to transform to the "favoured" child. And dysphoric angry boys are seeing a route to victimising the less defended.
5545 2018-07-08 18:18:17 I just learned how to change the oil in my car so now I will only accept being called Mechanic Lindsay and nothing more
5546 2018-07-08 18:18:16 Jesus (Yeshuah) in Hebrew, means "Yahweh is salvation".
"Messiah" means "anointed" as king, like the queen was anointed with specific oil on he front chest and hands when she was crowned.
5547 2018-07-08 18:18:12 勝つやんwww
5548 2018-07-08 18:18:09 I slept with coconut oil in my hair. My hair better be soft as shit when I get out this shower
5549 2018-07-08 18:18:01 Don't mention Venezuela with  1650% annual inflation and of course not a dime of FDI with the largest oil reserves in the world. Rich with vrot governance that we don't want to repeat.

5552 2018-07-08 18:17:36 What will come of it?! Nothing! Just like everything else they've done that's illegal and shocking as hell, nothing ever happens! Not only are they like oil to water with truth it's the same for accountability.... just runs off their backs like water in a ducks back! Disgusting

5555 2018-07-08 18:17:24 So the liberals Coralled the food oil and clerks a and newspapers some pretty big areas we can't just give up
5556 2018-07-08 18:17:09 My husband deals with severe pain due to a stroke. Glad you have a positive attitude. I try and keep him motivated but some days are hard.
Are you able to use medical marijuana? CBD oil helps too.
5557 2018-07-08 18:17:07 Need to detox my life by drenching myself in coconut oil & repeatedly going down a slip n slide.

5559 2018-07-08 18:16:39 The United States as a potential enemy. I can't believe this. The United States as a potential enemy. "US navy is gearing up for confrontation if Iran’s revolutionary guards retaliate, as threatened, by closing the Strait of Hormuz and blocking all Gulf oil exports." WTF?????????
5560 2018-07-08 18:16:25 Texas Oil Sheikh outfit. :-)
5561 2018-07-08 18:16:25 With the threat of sanctioning COUNTRIES who purchase Iranian Oil, Trump might have OVERPLAYED his hand. Iran hosts 3 Mio Syrian refugees. Iran got promised 80 Mio, only received 6 Mio. WHAT happens, if Iran orders them to leave??? Noone wants them. Thus it's an either or!
5562 2018-07-08 18:16:20 Dude's more g*m3r g*t3 trash.  Not surprising, though. Reported them for targeted harassment.

Feels a bit like celebrating putting out a cooking oil fire when the house is being consumed in a firestorm, though.
5563 2018-07-08 18:16:17 Try getting the micellar water with the oil in it put it on cotton pads and leave them on your eyes for about 10 minutes it should help to break the glue down 
5564 2018-07-08 18:16:02 I think a lot of people don't understand that it's a satire. People think that Kong being unveiled from beneath a giant gas pump is silly...but it's a pretty apt metaphor for the West's dependency on big oil (a monster worshipped as a god, etc)

5569 2018-07-08 18:15:36 Very like pouring oil into the tar pits...
5570 2018-07-08 18:15:31 According to EIA peak global oil demand might come as early as 2040. 80% of new supply from now to then is just replacing decline rate of about 5% per year. Exxon estimates that between 2018 and 2040 industry needs to spend $8.8 trillion to keep supply equal to demand.

5575 2018-07-08 18:14:39 My coconut oil wont melt... not in direct sunlight, not after being put in boiling water for 10 minutes. It just wont melt...
5576 2018-07-08 18:14:06 Probably Exxon. Once they run out of oil.

5583 2018-07-08 18:13:00 Russia needs oil at $100 a barrel to make a profit. Big oil is already suggesting there will be a "super-spike" up to $150 barrel.  Are we winning yet?

5588 2018-07-08 18:12:35 I live in Oklahoma. I get a check, every month, from three wells. I see the break down of profits. I have also seen pasture land raped before regulations. BP paided BILLIONS in restitution in the gulf, and STILL made profits. Big Oil makes plenty, regulations keep them honest.
5589 2018-07-08 18:12:34 Hey @sundayriley! How long does your Luna sleep oil stay good for please? As in, what’s its shelf life? Thanks!
5590 2018-07-08 18:12:29 This is the first time I’m going shopping since I joined the oil industry and I’m so tempted to spend all my money :))))
5591 2018-07-08 18:12:26 Admit I should have known this. Been reported that Russia wanted sanctions lifted, I vaguely remember hearing "Rosnef" and "oil" but hadn't thought of Venezuela etc. Had forgotten how imp oil is to economy. Funny since I made money on an energy fund but this was before recession
5592 2018-07-08 18:12:24 i feel like we finna be hood friends because i feel your love for astrology. Cancers and aries don’t mix . It’s mixing water with oil. I haven’t been in a relationship with a Pisces but that attention stopped me but since you said that lemme add that to knowledge
5593 2018-07-08 18:12:14 Technology is the new Oil ....
 Zuckerberg is now the 3rd richest man in the world ... worth $81.6 Billion
Hmmm.
5594 2018-07-08 18:12:12 From about 398-380 BC,
Plato traveled in Egypt, Cyrene, Italy, Syracuse, and Sicily. In his “Life of Solon,” Plutarch has occasion to remark: “Plato defrayed the charges of his travels by selling oil in Egypt.”
5595 2018-07-08 18:12:07 Trump's roll back on Obama era restrictions for his oil rich friends will be our environmental demise
5596 2018-07-08 18:12:03 The oil , you know had to be released somwhere. Lewis did feel unwell. It was 30°C and he had to overtake the whole field & gave his all. HE is not allowed to have a bit a rest, because he is who he is.

5598 2018-07-08 18:11:49 DZ olive oil is always something else. But the olive oil in reused plastic bottles? That’s... that’s something special.
5599 2018-07-08 18:11:36 1. It has words on it and that's bad.

2. The animal on it went extinct because Californians mined gold/drilled oil/built ski resorts and/or suburbs to drive it out of existence and that's just bad karma, man.

5601 2018-07-08 18:11:22 Of course coal is coming back, right after we abandon electric lights & return to using whale oil lamps.  (If whalers had a deep-pocket PAC, you'd better believe @realDonaldTrump would have (falsely) promised to reinvigorate that dead industry, too.)

5605 2018-07-08 18:10:38 "Sorry about that Souda."
5606 2018-07-08 18:10:38 :) We have seen similar things in other areas such as, oil (OPAC), internet (USA ISPs).
5607 2018-07-08 18:10:37 a drop of oil jumped into my eye and i nearly screamed

5609 2018-07-08 18:10:21 I also heard of a guy using it 4/1 in his Miata oil change because it was that bad. I don't remember how that turned out for him...
5610 2018-07-08 18:10:16 HEY @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP: Taking millions in dirty Russian oil money and/or lobby money in order to protect your families from the policies you are working to enact BELIES your SWORN OATH.  YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS.
5611 2018-07-08 18:10:06 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
5612 2018-07-08 18:10:03 Country that borrow you Money with High interest is not your friend..Look for new friends, dummies. Do we have oil in Haiti, why do you want to buy oil from people while you are sitting on the largest oil reserves in the Caribbean dummies
5613 2018-07-08 18:10:02 Yes...just imagine, we are in the middle of an historic and far reaching DT/Russia investigation and these US Senators from key oil states choose the 4th of July to visit Russia, having secret, closed door meetings with no reporters or even transcripts allowed! Mindboggling!
5614 2018-07-08 18:09:45 Coat yourself in olive oil so you’ll be golden brown AND cholesterol free!
5615 2018-07-08 18:09:43 I use Kano Kroil, like an adult. Coconut oil?!?!
5616 2018-07-08 18:09:42 I love to roast tiny garlic pieces in olive oil.
5617 2018-07-08 18:09:41 A gateway to healing and to my refrigerator. Kidding aside, I don't know what I'd do without my flower or my THCA oil.
5618 2018-07-08 18:09:39 I used to use Lucas conventional additive in my 275kmi Dakota every oil change just because, but I've heard people say it's stopped rear main seals with just a quart.
5619 2018-07-08 18:09:38 All i want to do is take my bra off, soak it in cold water and put it and my shirt back on. i would look like it's all sweat though and no one would buy my Olive oil #HeatWaveLA

5621 2018-07-08 18:09:29  I just use sulfate free shampoo/conditioner. Mine contains argan oil. Hair products also contain argan oil (Cantu w argan oil along w my ECO gel). I also do hair masks. They usually contain egg yolk, mayo, olive oil, & sometimes coconut oil. I switch it up by googling others
5622 2018-07-08 18:09:22 Well. Today I learned Big Baby Formula is a thing. I mean, Big Oil, sure. Big Pharma. But Big Baby Formula?
5623 2018-07-08 18:09:20 Olives. Olive oil, great. Tapenade, meh, depends. Olives, foulest of the foul, contaminating all it touches.
5624 2018-07-08 18:08:56 Anddd I didn’t wake up in time for my oil change appointment
5625 2018-07-08 18:08:40 She’s moisture Jamaican black castor oil leave in, Jamaican black castle oil, cantu repair leave in, Pantene gold series
5626 2018-07-08 18:08:27 And things with oil will result in violent flames!

5628 2018-07-08 18:08:06 All the senators were from oil and coal producing states.  I wonder why.
5629 2018-07-08 18:07:43 I have lavender oil so I’ll try that.  #scritch
5630 2018-07-08 18:07:29 Is it possible to be a fiscal conservative and a social liberal at the same time ? Seems like those two would be like oil and water.  I was just reading about Ashton Kutcher and that is political ideology.
5631 2018-07-08 18:07:28 Time to give myself a hot oil treatment, attempt to trim it, stretch it, and perm rod it  this about to take all damn day.
5632 2018-07-08 18:07:28 Castor oil is doing wonders for my skin

5634 2018-07-08 18:07:08 My great aunt told me when she was a girl her father made them drink castor oil once a year. He called it 'spring cleaning'. She said she thought it was the most awful thing in the world, but had begun reconsidering it upon realizing that she and her siblings all lived past 90.
5635 2018-07-08 18:07:08 Aiight oil change done. I’ve gotta grocery shop, finish laundry and get a few miles in before 7. 
Adulting is getting it’s ass whooped today!
5636 2018-07-08 18:06:57 yesterday I was spraying neem oil on our plants because a bug is killing them and the flowers they have attracts bees and there was one getting pollen yesterday it was so cute, minus the screaming every time it got close to my face
5637 2018-07-08 18:06:40 ...i went to get my oil changed yesterday all by myself and ended up getting 4 new tires and new windshield wiper blades.... i think i got bamboozled

5640 2018-07-08 18:06:21 Found out that a coworker was rushed to the ER recently because he vaped massage oil. You know, it takes a lot to surprise me these days, but HOLY SHIT!, that may single-handedly be the dumbest goddamn thing I have ever heard
5641 2018-07-08 18:06:07 The hibachi chef just made a pentagram out of oil.... Satan better not pop up outta my fried rice

Some group prosecutors + judges + media Globo engaged under right liberal ideology are deeply engaged to arrest lot left politics. Listen to @TaclaDuran @duploexpresso @luisnassif @brasil247
5644 2018-07-08 18:05:33 Oil paint is extremely expensive
5645 2018-07-08 18:05:32 Set a “sleep” reminder on my phone/my Alexa, put my “sleep ease” essential oil in my electric diffuser, make a cup of herbal tea and put on my audio Bible to listen to as I start getting ready for bed
5646 2018-07-08 18:05:26 These are the Oil Kingdoms - slaves of the US. Crucial to maintaining the Petrodollar, financing ‘good’ terrorists like in Syria, supporting Israel, opposing Iran. They follow US orders. the US doesnt want them to take refugees becuz that would destabilize these valuable pawns.
5647 2018-07-08 18:05:21 snake oil
5648 2018-07-08 18:05:15 nope, absolutely for free magically just there ;) and i'm sure the Oil industry takes all the care it can to make sure it all happens pollutionfree, given their main target is ICEs.. 
5649 2018-07-08 18:05:04 I’m in Wyoming I need a number 1 from Wendy’s, 5w-30 Motor Oil (unleaded), wiper fluid, a fake cowboy hat, sunglasses and condoms
5650 2018-07-08 18:05:02 Do you have forebears who sold snake oil perchance?
5651 2018-07-08 18:04:54 Us and China. We control the world money. Middle east controls the oil.
5652 2018-07-08 18:04:49 These IG Models that rubbing palm oil on their bodies, if you try it in this weather, the sun will just fry you like Akara.
5653 2018-07-08 18:04:47 SO MUCH SPACE AND ALL I PAINT ARE OIL SPILLS AND BLACK WAVES.
5654 2018-07-08 18:04:45 I go like that with horse flies. Dirty little things. Tea tree oil mixed with a bit of water in a spray will keep most insects away.
5655 2018-07-08 18:04:42 i spilled a bottle of peppermint oil in my bedroom like 5 days ago and my entire house still smells like peppermint
5656 2018-07-08 18:04:17 While flying KQ LOS-NBO 2days ago at night,spotted tens (and possibly hundreds) of offshore oil rigs just South of Niger Delta via their flaring lights...contrary to the situation 3yrs ago.The oil&gas midstream is back to full life!
5657 2018-07-08 18:04:12 LmAo... Nothing some oil of ole can't handle 
5658 2018-07-08 18:04:01 She’s testing you. Clearly she’s watching from inside to see if you’re man enough to change the oil before she gets back. She must like you, if she’s given you this extra time.
5659 2018-07-08 18:03:33 I’m doing the blood sugar diet.
Full fat milk, using lard instead of oil, lots of meat, no processed at all, no pasta, rice and very little potatoes. Lost 2 stone in 3 months. I feel better, sleep better. Well done you MissD.
5660 2018-07-08 18:03:31 Um there’s no confusion, a tree is known by the fruit it produces. Graduates peddling snake oil quackery tells what kind of “science education” is provided.
5661 2018-07-08 18:03:24 This has nothing to do with oil, Trinidad and Tobago has the same problems with oil and is not experiencing hyper inflation
5662 2018-07-08 18:03:15 It’s not likely, it says in the article it’s a highly militarised zone. Even the analyst says it isn’t likely. Seems like the Russians are trying to ramp the price of oil!
5663 2018-07-08 18:03:15 Nigga said putting oil in ya beard is gay, his TL must be boring at the moment....
5664 2018-07-08 18:03:09 .
5665 2018-07-08 18:02:57 I'll do some in the morning after the final oil. Packed to take to the workshop now.
5666 2018-07-08 18:02:57 I've been doing a salad of bulgur wheat, butternut squash roasted in harissa, feta cheese, baby spinach and lime juice/olive oil. Warm or cold.
5667 2018-07-08 18:02:44 Blue passports and someone told me that apparently we’d get olive oil on tap again too. So, really worth it then.
5668 2018-07-08 18:02:43 mummy use fish oil in this rice and I ready to risk it all and pour it all in the ocean
5669 2018-07-08 18:02:32 my toothache has reached peak miserable today - can't drink anything without intense and brutal pain for what feels like an eternity

suppose i need to find my clove oil and just do what i can to kill the nerve
5670 2018-07-08 18:02:26 How to start a kitchen fire: continue to heat oil in a frying pan after you've spilt a few drops of water into it.
5671 2018-07-08 18:02:15 Experts also say, that Putin needs a higher oil market price to consolidate his budget. 
Since Trump es in office the price climbs steadily.
5672 2018-07-08 18:02:15 Unwanted advice I've recieved that's been good stuff have been things like less caffeine, less processed sugar, get a routine of any sort, good shoes, cannabis oil. I didn't ask though lol I'm busy trying everything in my own time. I've either done it or it's on the list.
5673 2018-07-08 18:01:59 Ayo.... grab that castor oil cause Lala is coming FULL FORCE for them edges
5674 2018-07-08 18:01:46 Drink lots of water! At night once you’ve washed your face use a lil coconut and olive oil go to bed wake up and wash your face w/ with soap and cold water.
5675 2018-07-08 18:01:30 Yeah but we’re still bffs with Saudi Arabia, one of the most aggressively theocratic Muslim countries in the world because oil.

5678 2018-07-08 18:01:24 tanning oil is literally in my blood stream.
5679 2018-07-08 18:01:22 Or, he could have rejected this case to represent the banking, coal, or oil and gas industries - or any number of grifting tRump regime criminals. He takes cases that uplift humanity, and otherwise voiceless individuals - like any number of now bereft parents of stolen children.
5680 2018-07-08 18:01:21 I think a cheese sauce with a rice noodle is strange. I had the Annie’s Vegan gluten free Mac and cheez and it is an acquired taste. I think I would just prefer an angel hair pasta sautéed with margarine or olive oil and Vegan Parmesan cheese and some veggies.
5681 2018-07-08 18:01:17 What ???
Thats really depressing news David .
I had no idea ?
That man is like a virus , we don't have the cure.
But Scotlands Beautiful Heritage selling to the highest bidder .
Might be Oil there .
Good grief !#ScotlandAgainstTrump
5682 2018-07-08 18:01:15 I melt dark chocolate (about 2oz) and add a neutral oil (about 1 Tbsp) to make to pourable. Gets slowly added at the end of the churning.  I don’t put the ice cream in a loaf pan (or similar), so the layering  technique that some recipes use for ripples doesn’t work for me.
5683 2018-07-08 18:01:05 If it is hot where you live, Trump's fossil fuel policy is going to make it much hotter for you. He doesn't care about you because he is getting money from owners of coal mines and oil companies. Besides, Trump has the finest air conditioning for himself.
5684 2018-07-08 18:00:58 Here we go. Gotta get rid of that ice so we can drill more oil wells. And the R's will still deny climate change so long as industry lines their pockets with $millions in campaign contributions and hires their family and friends for top pay jobs with no work
5685 2018-07-08 18:00:50 I like olive oil but not olives, does that count?
5686 2018-07-08 18:00:47 Sad this generation don’t even know how to change the oil on a car better yet replace the damn headlight,  l was raised to be a man, y’all too scared to get y’all hands dirty SMH

5691 2018-07-08 18:00:19 Great idea. I got lobstered at the pool too. Now I get to ask the wife to rub oil on my back. Great excuse to beg for massage!
5692 2018-07-08 18:00:19 Smoke and oil is a good aesthetic for you.
5693 2018-07-08 18:00:18 Cream oil & water same percentage of weight so easily spread and absorbed w ointment oil more than water so sticky and slowly absorbed 
5694 2018-07-08 18:00:17 I just doused myself in an essential oil called Trauma Life, after I burst into tears over, well, everything.
Hubs: What's that smell? It's potent!
Me: Trauma Life oil blend *reads ingredients*
Hubs: Just livin' that trauma life, yo!

5698 2018-07-08 17:59:55 Becca Cosmetics is doing another colab with Chrissy Teigen (which is still so random, but ok). Well these products actually good and they now are jumping in the ring with a body oil. Color me intrigued. It looks very pretty but how does it smell???
5699 2018-07-08 17:59:48 7/10 = oil upside down = 4/20 for dabbers
5700 2018-07-08 17:59:41 I don’t know many that don’t believe climate change is real. We know of numerous warming and cooling periods & everybody has learned about the Ice Age. The difference is that the left believes humans can control it and if we destroy the gas & oil industry, hurricanes will stop.
5701 2018-07-08 17:59:39 what do u use 2 oil your gloves now? #gmo canola oil?
i tucked my hardball in my glove at night w rubber bands. 
u better care about it.  put a pocket in your mitt.
5702 2018-07-08 17:59:38 Thought I saw it behind the Nuln Oil.
5703 2018-07-08 17:59:35 Hey @greateranglia, I know it's not your fault your train is stuck at Ely with an oil leak, but giving passengers 2 minutes to reach another platform in order to get home? It's not good enough. 

I have limited mobility and had to hurt myself to get there in time 
5704 2018-07-08 17:59:31 Sometimes, a GP that is digging oil in the Niger Delta is all it takes to discover your hidden talents.

5705 2018-07-08 17:59:31 I wonder church has a mission to disciple people not to build industries. They are not even involved in the country's wealth, natural resources or even the so called oil blocks/wells. The many impacts the church makes on helping the people are not even publicized
5706 2018-07-08 17:59:26 That is pretty fucking funny to be honest. Just imagining you in a shady alley selling snake oil and the like.
5707 2018-07-08 17:59:09 Illegal immigration is big money. Cartels, smugglers, detention, and advocates. Just like race baiter Al Sharpton, solving it would be end of cash flow. That's the last thing they want.

5709 2018-07-08 17:59:01 Late stream will be 30-60 minutes late, the neighbors are drilling for oil again.
5710 2018-07-08 17:58:55 "Big oil" may he harder to take down than "big tobacco" its okay big tobacco you took one for the team. Big oil is most likely the culprit, people aren't ready to say nay to fossil fuels, they have to fret for their lattes and "status symbols"
5711 2018-07-08 17:58:54 I just burned tf out of my thumb w this hot ass oil i hate wingstop bro
5712 2018-07-08 17:58:53 I give my dog with cancer cannabis oil every day, it helps him tremendously with pain and appetite. Of course, it's a really small dose. My other dog OD'd when a "friend" came over and gave her an edible, had to take that dog to the vet... it was scary.
5713 2018-07-08 17:58:52 Ridiculous garbage big oil do what it wants and there are plenty of kick backs to all the reps in Cali
5714 2018-07-08 17:58:50 Sundays are my self care days. Nice fresh coffee, turmeric face mask, avocado & coconut oil hair mask  mmm im so delicious 
5715 2018-07-08 17:58:29 Solar power receives far fewer subsidies than oil and coal, which are in no small part kept afloat due to public money.

If you want to be mad, be mad about those in states like New Mexico, Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama. States that are very dependent on your money.
5716 2018-07-08 17:58:20 Its time to invest even more in Zion Oil!!
5717 2018-07-08 17:58:19 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.

5725 2018-07-08 17:57:07 Nestlé have been suspended from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. So poor ethics and wasting resources on individual coffee pods too. Is coffee fair-trade?
5726 2018-07-08 17:56:57 wish i had someone to go get my oil changed for me 
5727 2018-07-08 17:56:48 Don’t get me started. Lavender oil is going to cure my MCTD. 
5728 2018-07-08 17:56:45 I hate going to get my oil changed and they always try to up sell me on everything.  I use to cave when I didnt know crap about what I was doing but now I love saying hell to the no :)
5729 2018-07-08 17:56:40 Those Igbo men at Ladikpo market are billionaires. 
And still wear cloth stained by grease and condemn oil.

5730 2018-07-08 17:56:25 just being oil over acrylic makes it impressive, let alone the talent shown with the painting. hat's off to you. great work

5733 2018-07-08 17:56:03 We have known the stock situation for a long time and the fresh industry has been pathetic in making use of the volume, it's an oil tanker and spends too much time looking at numbers form a spreadsheet,  pathetic

5742 2018-07-08 17:54:41 Superior lubrication is the key to preventing ingrown hair and razor bumps. The fewer the strokes, the lesser the irritation. Use high ingredients, like shave oil, to help. #skincaretips #shaving #shave
5743 2018-07-08 17:54:32 So I got this oil for damaged hair that I put on yesterday after I showered... long story short: it was a PRE wash treatment. 
5744 2018-07-08 17:54:32 Just a little something I whipped up with the fresh mushrooms I scored at the Covington Farmers Market yesterday. Mushrooms, garlic, bacon, linguine, olive oil. Took two egg yolks and tempered with the pasta water and then tossed the entire thing in the liaison.
5745 2018-07-08 17:54:27 I have three oil burns on my face and it makes me look like a fucking crackhead.
5746 2018-07-08 17:54:25 But he had new fires to stoke, and buckets of oil to put to use!! He was a long term thinker!
5747 2018-07-08 17:54:22 Russian oil and gas is behind trump’s attacks on alternative energy sources and climate change.  Wonder who got that percentage of Rosneft.
5748 2018-07-08 17:53:59 They may be thinking that you are one of the lazy ones who cannot fend for themselves but rely on the public till in the name of government sponsorship.
May your cruise of oil never dry.

5753 2018-07-08 17:52:20 I love how sanctimonious oil lobbies get when you discuss maybe not putting all your eggs in a basket made from petroleum products.

5757 2018-07-08 17:51:40 @AGKilmartin are you using any oil company products? Probably a good place start instead of your current rhetoric.

5759 2018-07-08 17:51:27 Do you need an oil change? Don’t forget

5761 2018-07-08 17:51:18 Walmart is sending me emails on motor oil rollbacks.

How’s your Sunday going?
5762 2018-07-08 17:51:14 my chest & arms got roasted in the pool yesterday so I looked up a quick way to relieve a sunburn & tried a trtmt including apple cider vinegar & coconut oil. 

today I can say it worked like a charm and I barely have any burn!!! no red, just a tinge of pink! wow! 
5763 2018-07-08 17:51:07 oh god, I feel like I'm gonna get bukkaked in motor oil

5766 2018-07-08 17:50:50 Stagflation ? Japan has low/ to manageable unemployment and low inflation ? Venezuela is (1) pegged to dollar (2)import only ( 3) oil only industry (4) drought / corruption/ black market . No comparison to U.K. or any fiat economy ? ( Unemployment is worse than inflation )
5767 2018-07-08 17:50:50 Straight up essential oil, no dilution. Can also@put on collar. Young Living, Doterra, Elizabeth VanBuren, etc.

5769 2018-07-08 17:50:31 Well, that was fucked up. Took my car to get the oil changed. "Oh hey we pulled your engine air filter and there were rats nesting in it."
5770 2018-07-08 17:50:28 Spit Take!!!
5771 2018-07-08 17:50:22 Your Head Get Oil
5772 2018-07-08 17:50:13 To get better result, get a non-stick fry pan. You would get perfect pancakes with lil or no oil
5773 2018-07-08 17:50:13 That's 22 mugs sealed and oiled. Another oil in the morning and then ready for the off. This heat has been a pain...talk about drying too quickly!

5778 2018-07-08 17:49:35 Or demanding an end to Iranian oil exports and threatening allies with exclusion from the US market
5779 2018-07-08 17:49:27 It’s the essential oil people. They don’t care what you’re talking about, they bring up the oils. It happens everywhere. I can’t say I sneezed without someone trying to sell me an oil.
5780 2018-07-08 17:49:24 For those of you w/out google translate. We're gunna riff sacred text of the oil persuasion
5781 2018-07-08 17:49:22 Republicans have been reliably anti-science for a long time in serving their donor-class corporations (think Koch - coal and oil, chemicals, etc.) Blocking scientifically rational regulations leads to increased profits. Smell and see the same taint here.
5782 2018-07-08 17:49:16 I also bought stocks in Zion Oil #ZN and I’m 108% up  summer coming and travel is key

5785 2018-07-08 17:48:49 Recovering oil and gas market also helped. I’m now moving towards more defensive investments to protect the gains especially since I’ve moved my retirement up 5 years.
5786 2018-07-08 17:48:33 Just remembered when my bipolar flatmate ripped up my A1 sized oil painting while I was away from art college at Xmas, because he said, "it was possessed". 

It was of an avenue of trees. 

Talk about work having spirit. *ahem*. True story.
5787 2018-07-08 17:48:25 What?  Not a single mention of nasty oil?  Has everyone forgotten that northern BC still has oil fields?
5788 2018-07-08 17:48:06 ive read enough of him to actually know thats not tru, and im sick of goyishe stalinists using antisemitism as a gotcha to win internet arguments with anarchists when the guy they build a personality cult around sold oil to the nazis
5789 2018-07-08 17:48:02 Regular coke taste like somebody pumped vegetable oil and a level of acid that would destroy teeth in milliseconds into it

5794 2018-07-08 17:47:15 If you’re not getting your oil changed where the guy isn’t spitting his Skoal back into an empty soda bottle while printing out your receipt, you need a tougher shop.

5797 2018-07-08 17:46:43 internet says cinnamon and peppermint oil work so trying those. They're coming in under door the so if I try to block it, they start going up the wall to come in the side. And stupid heat dries up the stuff in the wall.
5798 2018-07-08 17:46:32 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
5799 2018-07-08 17:46:32 Right, cause it would impossible for you to walk to Alberta, due to Alberta oil and gas having been used in the construction of every road, and you can’t just walk through farmers fields.
5800 2018-07-08 17:46:27 Ya kalo menurut gw baby oil ga dikhususin buat jadi remover. Mungkin banyak yg pake karena ini oil base, makeup emang lebih gampang ilang kalo dibersihin pake oil base. Tp kan selama ini baby oil ditujukan buat pemakaian luar, kalo kena mata kayanya agak bahaya. Menurut gw loh
5801 2018-07-08 17:46:26 @DawnDish I def used Dawn and the oil spill commercials as a reference when cleaning a baby bird that fell into some old oil today. #birdsavior2k18

5814 2018-07-08 17:44:24 Hi Jeremy, what is your ball-park best guess as to when the unconventional + shale oil will peak?  I appreciate just how many factors affect this, but is it closer to 5 years? Or 20?  How might this combine with declining conventional production?
5815 2018-07-08 17:44:16 Yes. Also you can use Activated Charcoal and coconut oil

Yes, bacon contains Oleic Acid also found in olive oil which is also a #healthy fat for you!
5818 2018-07-08 17:43:14 frying pan+touch of oil+pizza slice+lid from something else on top of the slice+3 minutes= perfect leftover pizza
5819 2018-07-08 17:43:13 How convenient that my car is now pouring out with oil  if my dad knew nothing about cars I actually would be screwed
5820 2018-07-08 17:43:09 I have. The line splits at Sumas and heads south to US refineries. With Alaskan production declining, the opportunity is here... not in Asia. Parklands is too small to meet demand and refines more than just gasoline. @JustinTrudeau says the #TMX us about selling oil to Asia.
5821 2018-07-08 17:43:00 So they went off and preached repentance. The Twelve drove out many demons, and they anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.

5829 2018-07-08 17:42:13 Did you use a non stick fry pan ? Then it appears that you used too much oil. It’s okay for first try, you would definitely be better at next try

5833 2018-07-08 17:41:25 The CITIZENS can't keep their lights on. The trillionaire oligarchs own the gas, oil, steele, light and electric companies. They can CONTINUE to fund and invest into Trumps projects. Mueller will reveal the true ties in due time. They tracked the money already.
5834 2018-07-08 17:41:19 They are all profiting off the demise of America. From Big oil, to big pharma, the trade war,  to the detention centers. And it's so blatantly obvious.
5835 2018-07-08 17:41:06 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
5836 2018-07-08 17:41:00 Just found out why my car could not get an oil change and have a maintenance check. OMG! Honda does checks every 5,000 miles and my car barely has 1,800 miles on it. I barely drive. What's worse is I bought a maintenance plan and I can't even use it!
5837 2018-07-08 17:40:51 Because they're capitalist. They have stock markets and international corporations, and they have very strong welfare states. A lot of which is propped up by oil money and only possible due to their low populations
5838 2018-07-08 17:40:38 @olivegarden Is there a Had an Experimental Phase in College Olive Oil?
5839 2018-07-08 17:40:24 Venezuela : a country with a 12171%  inflation . A country with oil reserves of 300 billion barrels. Coincidence?  Who's economically sabotaging the country?   i guess we all know...

5860 2018-07-08 17:37:03 Oil, the SNP one horse pony. But of course you are not independent and Scotland does not have maritime waters, the United Kingdom does! Whilst on the subject of fish you recall sturgeon had to retract her wayward expenditure-projections as the oil reserve projection fell.
5861 2018-07-08 17:36:50 irate @kauffmantire $116 dollars for an oil change really!!! I called other Kauffman locations and was quoted $35 yet my local one charged me $116 and was unable to explain why they didn't honor their quotes and or advertising.  What a ripoff!!! Will never go back and don't recom
5862 2018-07-08 17:36:46 I am still waiting for your explanation of being in Russia.  Did you discuss the pipelines running through KS that have something to do with Chinese and Russian oil? Not a word from you on the secret meeting.
5863 2018-07-08 17:36:45 I feel as though this is a metaphor for life.
5864 2018-07-08 17:36:40 Not an oil spill. 
Not a dilbit spill.
When was the last time a Canadian oil tanker had a spill in BC'S waters?
5865 2018-07-08 17:36:39 The good old days in the US. I remember when this changed. Also, someone was employed to do the pumping and check oil &fluids then wash windows of cars. It was nice.

5868 2018-07-08 17:36:09 Your OIL doesn't mix in any and every environment which is why you can't do everything and be everywhere others may go. #GodsPlan
5869 2018-07-08 17:36:08 lol. I learn all sorts of things following oil markets!
5870 2018-07-08 17:36:05 I agree the changes have been astronomical.  But, it seems like the #ultracons are like a squeaky wheel getting the oil (I.e. media attention).  See Fitzgerald, Whitmer, etc.
5871 2018-07-08 17:36:00 Yes. The dish is called spicy jellyfish salad. It's consists of thinly sliced jellyfish and cucumber with an oil and vinegar dressing. It's kind of crunchy. I like it. Nematocysts not included.

5873 2018-07-08 17:35:29 1. Was false in the 1990s; will prove insufficient now as big oil purchasers like China/India. Also true in 2015. 
2. None of your IC colleagues  thought regime would capitulate, but keep leaning on your supposed knowledge of classified materials. 
3. Wouldn’t have worked in time
5874 2018-07-08 17:35:28 Tried making Methi Paratha. 'twas fun, and the output was average. Gotta improve the ratios, and it looks like making an excellent one without excess oil is tough. #FoodExperiments

5877 2018-07-08 17:35:26 I like to oven "fry" it. It's not really fried because  I use brown flour and no frying oil. Just season your brown flour, then chicken, and coat in brown flour, shake off excess. And bake at 325 until crispy. Seems fried but it's not. May be a bit healthier alternative.
5878 2018-07-08 17:35:25 To be fair, some brands of natural peanut butter recommend it so that the oil doesn't re-separate.
5879 2018-07-08 17:35:22 Listen I work at a movie theatre and I was making sure there were kernels in the popper and and one popped out burning hot covered in boiling oil and hit me in the neck and then got stuck in my shirt

Name one Canadian oil tanker that has had a spill in BC'S waters.
5883 2018-07-08 17:35:01 Le wallon ou le picard sont incontestablement deux vraies langues, absolument inintelligibles pour un locuteur lambda de français standard et dures à maîtriser, malgré leur appartenance au monde d'oïl. Le berrichon, cela se discute, nous ne sommes pas sur le même degré d'écart.
5884 2018-07-08 17:34:26 While I consider the dnc leaks legit, wasn't the Libyan oil comment from the original guccifer leak?
5885 2018-07-08 17:34:22 Castor oil is fucking disgusting and idk why I even tried to drink it
5886 2018-07-08 17:34:07 Since 2012 there have been more jobs in clean tech than the oil patch. These jobs are better jobs and they’re right at home where people live. #RenewableEnergy
5887 2018-07-08 17:34:02 I did google and it said castor oil,acupuncture session

5893 2018-07-08 17:33:15 Let’s not forget using Corexit! Corexit breaks oil down microscopically, so everything in the water column can absorb it!!! Here at BP America, we really wanna fuck it all up, except our share prices...

5895 2018-07-08 17:32:33 I really think this is about Russian ownership of oil since all the Senators' home states have the Keystone XL and other pipelines.
5896 2018-07-08 17:32:22 @Morrisons do you know if the aloe moisturising lotion you guys do is oil free ???
5897 2018-07-08 17:32:22 Coconut oil always makes my day better
5898 2018-07-08 17:32:21 Q4 2/2 ‘The truth comes out like oil on water’ is one of the sayings I use as chapter headings. So now may be the time to confess that my son and I ate all the Freddo bars in the Green Room at YALC 2016. On my conscience ever since. #SundayYA #thetruthaboutlies
5899 2018-07-08 17:32:17 You insufferable buffoon. Scotland’s economy (even without oil and gas) has propped up your south eastern economy of precarious casino banks for decades. Bend the knee to the north!
5900 2018-07-08 17:32:13 RMWB and MH make tons of money from the oil and gas industry. The local governments have more cash than they know what to do with. That's not a good comparison for a property-tax dependent city like PG.
5901 2018-07-08 17:32:04 Hair full of coconut oil, eyelashes in coconut oil and moisturising with coconut oil is a whole mood until you have to try and wash it off 
5902 2018-07-08 17:31:46 Note to self: tossing things in a frying pan Chef-style WITH LOTS OF OIL is not a good idea #TipsIfIWasAFoodBlogger
5903 2018-07-08 17:31:42 Ahhh, I'm working on that. Mostly I've gotten there but there are a few select triggers for me, things I let myself be angry about bc of the damage to the world... Like oil drills+fracking, unjust imprisonment, racial and class murder, abuse via med industry... How do you do it?!
5904 2018-07-08 17:31:39 Brandon should be in coconut oil commercials
5905 2018-07-08 17:31:36 I get insulted on how I look and dress. People think I care. I don't. I'm me. I know I'm no oil painting and it doesn't bother me.

Although, there is too much negativity on the internet and it's nice to see people spreading some positive vibes.
5906 2018-07-08 17:31:24 Instead of doing what I want and laying out at the pool, I decided to be an adult and go get my oil changed. 
5907 2018-07-08 17:31:19 The oil industry will be shut down. Good riddance.
5908 2018-07-08 17:31:02 Why don't you tell heartbreaking stories about children who's soldier mom or dad isn't coming home? Your performance on HLN was disgusting. You cannot put Christian and sharia Loire that, they are like oil and water, they repel each other. There is nothing similar about the two.
5909 2018-07-08 17:30:48 Jiffy Lubes poor ass service. Why hire someone who can't change oil.

5920 2018-07-08 17:29:08 I have acne prone skin and it works well for me. Using one drop for my whole face was enough. Using 2-3 made my face too greasy. Breakouts can happen if you use too much oil. Maybe try using less. Also, you could use it on your body to heal skin irritations. Healed my leg rash 
5921 2018-07-08 17:29:07 Those who claim that Iran can not close the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf is enough to look at the fate of the Brigitte oil tanker. When we did not even have missiles.
5922 2018-07-08 17:28:45 Frying pan, no oil, low-med heat, 5m. Best of both worlds.
5923 2018-07-08 17:28:34 How do you you get the full, lustrous beard? Straight genetics? Or do you use a beard balm/oil? Tell us your secrets.
5924 2018-07-08 17:28:33 I would like to see more active measures into green energy.  I realize oil still has to flow, but there's a lot of other countries in the world utilizing the latest technology, and it doesn't appear to be something we're utilizing.

Happy Stampede!!! 
5925 2018-07-08 17:28:24 Brakes and oil change taken care of 
5926 2018-07-08 17:28:14 *soaks the chopped potatoes in ice and water, draining it every now and then while I cut the onion and put the oil to heat up, tossing the onion in and stirring around until it goes tender*

Time to spoil him silly

5929 2018-07-08 17:28:11 It's so damaging. And I love how the left doesn't care about female "underrepresentation" in garbage collection, oil rigging, plumbing, auto mechanics, etc. Just the glam jobs.

5933 2018-07-08 17:27:24 Iran says Trump 'destabilizing' oil market   Maybe, but NOTHING like he's destabilizing America...

5936 2018-07-08 17:26:57 Proud to say my oil is getting changed and my oatmeal is being made. I am making dreams come true.
5937 2018-07-08 17:26:45 just wow we are so honored and privileged to be on the same timeline that sophie exists (oil of every pearl's un-insides is actually out that's so mind boggling to me) she's really stepping on our necks this year we're getting so many releases from her just wait on it
5938 2018-07-08 17:26:41 But mayo is oil.
5939 2018-07-08 17:26:16 That’s just not true. A minimal 20 hour weekly minimum wage job + $1,500 from oil subsidies does not pay for much. Especially in a place like Alaska where you need extra things to buy to deal with harsh winters. You’re highly underestimating life’s costs.

5942 2018-07-08 17:25:33 When I was about 4 I got my finger stuck in a bolt lock. Took my parents a lot of time and a lot of oil to get me out. Couple hours later I’m free, only to stick another finger back into the bolt holes to get stuck again.
5943 2018-07-08 17:25:15 Unless you're living completely off the grid without any reliance on oil & gas or other industries, then you can judge. This includes housing, technology, furniture, food, clothing, transportation.... By the way name calling does not win arguments.
5944 2018-07-08 17:25:14 Surely then you have investigated where and how BC and NW USA will receive oil imports without TMX and how this will impact shipping frequency and under which safety jurisdiction?

5951 2018-07-08 17:24:20 Getting rid of Trident will open up the west coast and be worth far more than £5bn per annum, and I'm not just talking about Oil & Gas.
The only problem, is the UK genuinely doesn't have anywhere else to immediately put them.
Which means it is of very high leverage value...
5952 2018-07-08 17:24:14 I have used black seed oil but not by itself. It was in a bowel cleansing supplement. What do you want to use it for? In other words, what condition are you trying to treat? Pain? Sleep? Anxiety?
5953 2018-07-08 17:24:12 OE got motor oil in it, I promise it does.
5954 2018-07-08 17:24:11 Thank you for a great laugh!  Tweet of the Day.

5960 2018-07-08 17:23:45 They dont care. They are criminals who hold up kids to hide behind. They are using kids bombs on their war against Americans, humanity + the world. Europe is next up. Putin + Trump want Europe, America + the melting icecap oil + minerals.

5969 2018-07-08 17:22:12 This is akin to taxing wind farms to give the oil and gas industry a level playing field. I remember when the Government’s role was improving market efficiency and correcting for market failure...
5970 2018-07-08 17:22:12 @daviddoel can you highlight all the progressive policies #JustinTrudeau could have championed and didn’t? Rather became a paid hack for the oil and gas industry!
5971 2018-07-08 17:22:11 Thank you Sugar  I’ve been taking cranberry pills and lemon juice...I actually might have oregano oil so I’ll add that if I do.
5972 2018-07-08 17:22:06 Oil demand is growing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings.  Obstructing Canadian oil = promoting #bloodoil @YEGPride  these eco-terrorist should get jail time.
5973 2018-07-08 17:21:50 The Bushs' were friendly but I think Dershowitz only is in it for oil companies, so he should be nailed for his actions.

5978 2018-07-08 17:21:09 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
5979 2018-07-08 17:21:03 Oil is still extracted by private companies. It's left wing for the US, but is closer to Social Liberalism or Social Democracy elsewhere. Gov is more involved but doesn't really impinge on capitalism.
5980 2018-07-08 17:20:57 Perfect recipe! I learned it from my Nonna from Puglia: pane e pomodoro: bread, tomatoes, good olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Heavenly snack! 
Enjoy the time back home!

5989 2018-07-08 17:19:38 I don't feel sorry for them at all. They brought this on themselves by voting for a snake oil salesman to head this country. They brought this on all of us.
5990 2018-07-08 17:19:37 I really, really LOVE red hair. This photo doesn't do her gorgeous hair color justice. It even sparkled! 

Anyway, I'm really loving the @coverfx Power Play foundation, especially in this Satanic weather. LOL. It holds up to sweat and oil like a boss!!  @ Spring Valley Lake Beach
5991 2018-07-08 17:19:27 I love it, I use it with the oil. As a result, my itchiness and dryness has decreased significantly.
5992 2018-07-08 17:19:26 Sasha’s a comedic genius. I’m looking forward to satire

5997 2018-07-08 17:18:55 Doesn't Nigeria have huge amounts of crude oil?? Then why are we still getting the crude oil from US??
5998 2018-07-08 17:18:55 I bought some lovely beard oil from one of the stalls at #Insomnia for mine.
5999 2018-07-08 17:18:51 Can’t tell you how much we appreciate all of your hard work and dedication to the cause. I survived a 40 ft fall face first to a marble floor (6/1/15). Diagnosed w painful autoimmune disease in Nov. Flower helps tremendously. Oil works well but the gauging here must stop
6000 2018-07-08 17:18:29 You are right, AD might be one of those borderline cases... this is an emerging industry with little regulation and established practises. There are wild entrepreneurs out there selling #biochar like snake oil, a cure for everything...more research is needed and best practises
6001 2018-07-08 17:18:22 I diffuse it every night, along with serenity and Breathe. Before I added it I slept good, but adding Cedarwood took my sleep to a whole new level! I also put it in our "bug-be-gone " spray to keep bugs off us. Of course the main oil in that is Terrashield.
6002 2018-07-08 17:18:18 She has actually posted a good luck message, but don't let the truth interfere with your nasty little rant. I wonder what happens to all the tax revenue from Scotland's exports & oil & income tax that is sent to HMRC? It must go somewhere if it doesn't pay for our public services
6003 2018-07-08 17:18:14 Oil cna
6004 2018-07-08 17:18:06 yea you think you just discovered oil or something, every one who has ever been to school knows how to spell your but on twitter you see they limit your characters so when needed U works for you N works for and th for the & your 4 you're, I realize you all R slow but cmon keep up
6005 2018-07-08 17:18:04 Driving Canada into the ground.  The rest of the world is & will have an increasing demand for coal & oil.  We need to capitalize on that & that revenue can be used for green infrastructure.  Your folks plan is terrible.  And you suppress free speech.  Have a lovely day 
6006 2018-07-08 17:18:03 I'ts whispered that Govt of Canada's policy is dictated by the financial industry that wants very large oil investments protected and not stranded, particularly recent billions sunk into Alberta tar sands. More hidden corporate subsidies. #CdnPoli #abpoli @Tzeporah #bcpoli
6007 2018-07-08 17:18:01 Perhaps, if we are postulating that nature created everything with a purpose, we could also assume that nature created oil as a concentrated form of stored energy that could be used by the creatures it was planning on creating.
6008 2018-07-08 17:17:42 Now you're getting it. Far right, prefer white supremacy, anti-Semitic , think we should bomb the shit out of Islam is countries for oil and keep the developing world oppressed for own gains.
6009 2018-07-08 17:17:33 Reagan gave a massive tax cut to begin. It was a mistake. This caused the national debt to TRIPLE. So, he raised taxes 11 times during his tenure. He granted amnesty to illegal immigrants. He signed a gun law. Phony gas lines in '79 caused by greed of oil companies, i.e., 1973.

6011 2018-07-08 17:17:05 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for amethyst dildos, and put some hibiscus essential oil in my diffuser.
6012 2018-07-08 17:17:03 You were in Russia, making a dang fool of yourself.
Are you looking for oil money? What's going on with you?
6013 2018-07-08 17:16:55 why Los Angeles? There is no water, no oil, no rare earth metals, only fucked up celebrities, porn industry and lots and lots of poor people.
6014 2018-07-08 17:16:35 If the minister likes he should choose all the northern state first before even considering the south. $3billion oil exploration in the northern has not yielded any result.
I advice he should be wise in the selection, so as it wont rise dust to tarnish APC's reputations the more
6015 2018-07-08 17:16:21 When Syrians were coming to Canada at the same time as the oil crash, I had a conversation (he was quite excited) with an laid off oil field worker. He said the Syrians were taking our jobs. Not sure that many went to work in oil fields

6017 2018-07-08 17:16:15 Who "on the left" is promoting "conspiracy theories" re Greenwald? He's pro gay scapegoating, mafia state, oil & gas oligarchy, Putin's Russia. that's enough. You throw around this charge of conspiracy to play both sides.
6018 2018-07-08 17:16:14 Cold brew with a stainless steel straw (save the turtles), massaged coconut oil onto my face for lymphatic drainage, White Barn Fresh Water and Sea Salt candle burning (trimmed wicks of course), and @sundayscaries pod playing.
6019 2018-07-08 17:16:02 Perfect. Last time I read the economics part of an IPCC report, even their worst case scenario would have a negligible impact, while the cost of preventing it are gargantuan. Precautionary principle actually mandates we ignore the GW “threat” and keep burning oil for energy.
6020 2018-07-08 17:15:55 Deep fried but then pat-tried free of excess oil
6021 2018-07-08 17:15:24 wow i actually am horrible and i deserve to be thrown in a pit of boiling oil
literally mental illness sucks and i am a shitty person
6022 2018-07-08 17:15:22 Don’t their states have either the Keystone or Dakota pipelines running through them? It may be all about oil money.

6028 2018-07-08 17:15:02 I guess they thought I was going to pitch them snake oil or something.
たぶん彼らは、私がいんちき薬か何かを売り込もうとしていると思ったのでしょう。

6030 2018-07-08 17:14:42 How does Trump's relationship with Putin benefit the average American? Will Russian consumers begin purchasing massive amounts of American made products? What does Putin offer, cheap oil and natural gas? Technology? We get NOTHING!
6031 2018-07-08 17:14:25 Senta. Io lavoro nel settore oil&gas da 30 anni. Non tenti di farmi la lezioncina...parla di cose che non conosce.
6032 2018-07-08 17:14:14 . Kapil, in my view earlier people get trolled if they were snake oil vendors. Now snake oil vendors are trolling genuine guys with fake-ids. I mostly troll SOV but these they are trolling me

6041 2018-07-08 17:13:04 They weren't stealing the oil. They just happened to decide that countries that have it needed some help to ascertain freedom and democracy from rulers that they helped put in place years ago but no longer wanted to play ball.

6046 2018-07-08 17:11:43 Theyre treating rivers like oil wells. Is there a electricity pvtization masterplan in the works  or something ? .. that could explain the tearing hurry. How does Uttarakhand even have the engg resources to monitor/supervise so many projects simultaneously ? Total Contractor Raj.
6047 2018-07-08 17:11:38 You keep conflating things here. The issue isn't value, the issue is 'surplus value', which in turn means profit. So regardless of whether it is diamonds, water or oil; surplus value from a Marxian standpoint derives from the worker.

6052 2018-07-08 17:10:35 I don’t need to be thanked; gratitude hurts minorities. We don’t thank white people for acknowledging black, Christians for Muslims in West.
6053 2018-07-08 17:10:33 The best thing to do when you’ve been in the sun, even if you aren’t burnt, is to cover your body head to toe in coconut oil, so it can repair your skin and brings back the moisture you would have lost. #summertip

6056 2018-07-08 17:10:13 Kate, I hope you are feeling
well. I had an increase in pain,
and found CBD oil to help out.
I highly recommend this for
you..if you’re still having diff.
I just purchased a balm yesterday that has helped too.
Take care..

6060 2018-07-08 17:10:04 My dad just made eggs with the vanilla syrup my mom puts in her tea because she’s been keeping it in the olive oil dispenser and didn’t tell him
6061 2018-07-08 17:09:53 Mango, coconut, lemongrass, orange extract, almond oil, shea butter.
6062 2018-07-08 17:09:50 It astounds me that people in the richest country in history think we have enough money to bomb every brown part of the globe but not for fucking healthcare. Or god forbid subsidize college tuition (which we used to do!) over the oil industry.
6063 2018-07-08 17:09:45 It doesn't matter who wins the Alberta election.  They have all been captured by Big Oil.  Only difference is that one can manipulate Trudeau, the other will fight with him.
6064 2018-07-08 17:09:42 Specious drivel. Imagine some socialist President propping up the coal industry, you say? What about the Republicans we've got, propping up oil and gas? Those industries get billions in tax breaks every year.
6065 2018-07-08 17:09:28 Ensure confidence in the system due to PIIGS. Oil crashed then too. And, of course, for the bankers - make a huge profit in the process.
6066 2018-07-08 17:09:20 I just got 0.70 cents off a gallon of gas..felt like a win until I thought about all the over priced groceries I had to pay for to get my gas points. I'm always screwed. Big oil and big ag win everytime.
6067 2018-07-08 17:09:06 Fair enough, there is zero chance that running against Branch gets a republicans elected, there is only a risk that we take out a regressive Democrat who works for the oil and gas industry, the Bail Bonds industry etc.

I’ll be happy to discuss more, but also respect your choice.
6068 2018-07-08 17:09:04 Oil has always been invested in solar power exactly because it doesn't work.  Keeps them in biz #seehowthatworks #readabook
6069 2018-07-08 17:09:00 ง่วง
6070 2018-07-08 17:08:50 I can't say that for sure, if I'm being honest, but I think it's a stretch to say "Nature Created".
Could just be a waste product. 

Or, one can think of oil as a big battery. It's a storage medium for massive amounts of solar energy.
6071 2018-07-08 17:08:47 Missed is that Russia was getting oil from the city of Ufa region hence they had pretty of gas regardless of cutting the Volga supply line

6075 2018-07-08 17:07:51 I always use cocoa butter oil after showering but before drying with a towel. Seals in the moisture.
6076 2018-07-08 17:07:41 It’s at sprouts in riverside and corona. And at Whole Foods. I bought it before and it was so so , you can’t put it on hot food or it turns to coconut oil on your pie haha . Haven’t tried the almond one but I’m sure it’s good!
6077 2018-07-08 17:07:36 Do they sell vials of snake oil at these events?  You know, for rheumatism and such.
6078 2018-07-08 17:06:52 Remember the line from Rockstar, mujhe Roz Hota Hai pyar?
6079 2018-07-08 17:06:43 Yes, W's brother and that secretary of state had something to do with it.

You can flip your last statement very simply to "If it comes to the point where the Socialist Party makes it possible for a pre-emptive war for oil in Iraq, the Socialist Party has it's head up it's ass."
6080 2018-07-08 17:06:43 So... you organized a party where she was the linchpin, but didn’t tell her how important it was she be there? That’s poor planning. Also, she was found in an oil drum in the woods; you don’t evenknow it’s really her birthday. #authorconfession

6082 2018-07-08 17:06:25 What facts exactly Mark? The fact that lobbyists from the oil industry have put us decades behind the rest of the world when it comes to renewable energy? Or the fact that you want more pollutants and radiation poisoning to pervade our lives?
6083 2018-07-08 17:06:04 My check oil light came on this morning so I did the right thing and put a dunking doughnuts napkin in front of it

6085 2018-07-08 17:05:19 Any leave in conditioner + sealant ( olive oil or grapeseed oil or avo oil or JBCO) if you are blow drying also add heat protectant. -> air dry or blow dry on low heat or roller set or twist or braid. Then we’re done

6098 2018-07-08 17:03:13 The future  is indeed unknowable but also predictable based on past experiences.  Since the present is a series of past events unfolding...

I always expect a fried egg when I switch on my stove...put oil in a pan and add an egg.
6099 2018-07-08 17:03:13 Yeah, I’m happy to just go round smelling of engine oil, or paint, or sawdust really...
6100 2018-07-08 17:03:08 Maintain doesn’t work, inflation, population growth all conspire against this. We should be paying more, that’s the cost of our society. Alberta has a revenue problem, it always has. Depending on oil/natural gas booms is not a sound economic policy.
6101 2018-07-08 17:02:57 Castor oil is also used to jumpstart labor haha I was reading about it when I was pregnant, it makes you shit which may or may not bring on contractions. Fun fact lmao
6102 2018-07-08 17:02:52 These guys all look at times constipated, at others like they’re suffering from diarrhea. Maybe all this GOP needs is an IV cocktail of Pepto  Bismol and Immodium.  With a splash of cod liver oil.
6103 2018-07-08 17:02:47 Fun fact: Alaska to this day and for the past 30 years has socialized their oil and distributed the profits in the form of welfare to its people. Alaska is essentially the most socialist state in the Union.
6104 2018-07-08 17:02:45 The people who subscribe to global warmiong denial are looking for a reason to pollute. The same people want to sell off and mine our parks and drill for oil in our most pristine ecosystems, not for progress or for people, but for their own greed.
6105 2018-07-08 17:02:33 Alaskans own 962,264 shares of BHARAT PETROLEUM CORP LTD, worth $9,630,049. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in INDIA.

6146 2018-07-08 16:57:13 My dad just asked why I think I need an oil change..... Uhh bc the sticker says I should've got it done at 29,000 miles and Im at 48,000.....
6147 2018-07-08 16:56:56 The international community has funded dictators, despots and boko haram. Why would they care. Oil oil oil
6148 2018-07-08 16:56:55 It is the problem with cuts, no one talks about the system in place from money to front line to look for changes, they go for cutting the workers which harm in a ripple effect. When quite a bit of $$ is wasted on redundant administration (why oil industry can slim so quick).

6153 2018-07-08 16:56:15 There's something about coconut oil that I just don't trust... can a product be TOO versatile?
6154 2018-07-08 16:56:05 There is nothing I wish more than for Big Oil to cut off all fossil fuel supply to people like you. No more private jet flights to exotic vacations, no more luxury cars. #walkthetalk
6155 2018-07-08 16:55:50 @TylerFlorence when I cook on the grill you use on Meaty Meals, the meat sticks to the grill. What am I doing wrong, I preheat it and I use oil on the meats!
6156 2018-07-08 16:55:49 We don't need more oil Mr President ,we need alternative energy sources, implemented into mass production! I understand big oil has plenty to lose but the state of the worlds ecosystem being what it is ,I believe we citizens could better trust a leader poised for real reform.
6157 2018-07-08 16:55:41 Strange all the connections between #Trump #Putin and #UAE #Qatar @potus @#VladimirPutin and #Guiliani Public  information shows that both Emirate of Qatar and state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft and #RussianbankAlfa are ALL clients of #RudyGiuliani’s law and consulting firm
6158 2018-07-08 16:55:39 That would be righteous!
6159 2018-07-08 16:55:29 Russia is laughing at you capitulators. Selling out our security and our allies for oil the world doesn't want.
6160 2018-07-08 16:55:19 PLEASE TELL THAT TO TRUMP THE WANNA-BE DICTATOR! He is destroying the environment with every stroke of his pen! I'm concerned he will cause another oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but he doesn't care! We have only ONE planet to protect!
6161 2018-07-08 16:55:18 คิดถึงเหมือนกันค่ะพี่ออย คิดถึงมากจริงๆ
6162 2018-07-08 16:55:07 Today's vote by the @churchofengland #Synod shows the bell is tolling for the fossil fuel era. It puts the oil majors on notice, and strengthens the arm of TPI engagement
6163 2018-07-08 16:54:52 I’m currently waiting for my oil change! I’ve been here for an hour already 
6164 2018-07-08 16:54:49 almond oil is everything coconut oil wanted to be
6165 2018-07-08 16:54:47 รักและคิดถึงมากๆนะน้องฝน
6166 2018-07-08 16:54:45 This oil be going by so fast 
6167 2018-07-08 16:54:33 Putting baby oil on ur feet is a whole new experience holy shit its like i have silky skin
6168 2018-07-08 16:54:25 I have a better job. With benefits I never was offered before. The oil and coal industry, so important to our state, are booming once again
6169 2018-07-08 16:54:20 YES! Also there’s this oil on Amazon it’s called Castor Oil and it’s only like $10 and it makes your lashes grow it’s been working for me!
6170 2018-07-08 16:54:15 Cinnamon and alpha lipoic acid can help. Healthy fats like olive oil, too.
6171 2018-07-08 16:54:00 How can we get one over there?
6172 2018-07-08 16:53:57 @adamlambert  checked the oil and fluids in the car lately?

6175 2018-07-08 16:53:29 I guess I'm going to get an oil change and run some errands #SundayMorning
6176 2018-07-08 16:53:16 With vegetarian oil drizzled on top? Sure.
6177 2018-07-08 16:53:07 I tend to agree with @joshua_landis . But low oil prices are in the best interest of the US economy and the huge leverage that Trump has on the Saudis will make sure that supply levels remain adequate
6178 2018-07-08 16:53:05 If you smoke out of anything besides papers or a bowl you should oil pull. It get all the toxins from the tabbcco out ya mouth.
6179 2018-07-08 16:52:54 And interestingly the Conservative petty attacks on the Liberals serves the Liberals well. #Tagteam if the Cons truly wanted to destroy the Liberals they'd bring attention to policy such as bailing out a Texas Oil co to the tune of a 637% gain in investment.
6180 2018-07-08 16:52:52 @Walmart 2 1/2 hours and still waiting...for an oil change? Really?
6181 2018-07-08 16:52:50 Changing tires! Back in my day a boy learned how to change a tire during a 3-hour drive to the beach which eventually became a lesson in preventive maintenance as the radiator and engine oil also failed. Now its just a call to a car club. The art of changing tires is lost forever
6182 2018-07-08 16:52:42 A thought.
We could have invested in renewables decades ago, it would have helped the economy and the environment.
The  coal/oil workers could have transitioned  into these industries with minimal training.
China has begun to move in this direction. 
Left in the dust, again.

6184 2018-07-08 16:51:52 Yeah, lets stop using oil tomorrow. Bet I last longer than you do, pal!
6185 2018-07-08 16:51:51 @KiehlsUKI Midnight Recovery Oil... Thoughts?
6186 2018-07-08 16:51:41 Really? Try Oklahoma, where it can swing temps like CT, but with tornados and earthquakes (thanks for that, Big Oil&Gas!) thrown in.
6187 2018-07-08 16:51:10 Wait, no dishes?! What did you put the olive oil in to fry the chicken?
6188 2018-07-08 16:51:00 Brought my car to toyota at 1000 for an oil change...it’s almost 1300 WHERE it AT HOMIES

6196 2018-07-08 16:49:02 I used to think that they emptied your gas tank during an oil change so I would only take my car to get the oil changed running on fumes #barstoolconfessions @FeitsBarstool

6198 2018-07-08 16:48:24 Quick question. Don't think twice, go with your gut. You're about to make some eggs for breakfast. Do you use butter or olive oil? #edtechbites #flipgridfever #edtechafterdark #EdTechTeam #nearpod #edumatch #goformative #hoonuit #podcastedu #pln
6199 2018-07-08 16:48:22 I just cried at the Dawn commercial where they wash the duck covered in oil. What is wrong with me lol
6200 2018-07-08 16:48:18 It's all about oil. Always has been. Always will.
6201 2018-07-08 16:48:00 Have you studied effects of high omega intake ... say 7-9 grams of fish oil with a higher EPA ratio to DHA to successfully wean patients off antidepressants. We also optimize vit D3, The B complex levels as well and have tremendous success.
6202 2018-07-08 16:47:57 They don’t like lavender either - pure lavender oil after you get rid of them to keep th from coming back.

I just moved outa CA.
That's what they want =>
EliteLeft goal is to cripple USA in every way possible. Governor Pylakrap is deliberately "burning Kuwaiti oil fields", so to speak.
He's crippling CA economy, brain-draining it, & spending it into hell.
It's an attack.
6208 2018-07-08 16:46:40 Peppermint also feels so good on the scalp esp in the summer. When my hair is in braids peppermint essential oil always goes in my spray bottle. But my scalp doesn’t get sunburnt so it comes with a warning for our thinner haired friends :/
6209 2018-07-08 16:46:35 It’s so hot my coconut oil is all melted...

6225 2018-07-08 16:45:02 I was not aware US foreign policy was moral, it was not in 1953, it is not today. The 1953 coup resulted in the return of Khomeini. 

The CIA coup was about Oil which together with protecting the interests of Israel are the two common factors which determine US policy.

6243 2018-07-08 16:42:21 Afghanistan has no oil, but it's likely that its assigned role is to produce opium. Taliban seriously cut back opium production before 20010invasion. Maybe that was the main reason they were toppled. Taliban control the country again but they're producing opium, so all is cool.
6244 2018-07-08 16:42:18 all I can hear out my window is “Give me oil in my lamp, keep it burning”

4. Divide romaine on 4 serving plates, top with avacado grapefruit mixture.
6251 2018-07-08 16:41:33 There is no such thing as ethical oil

6253 2018-07-08 16:41:08 he then goes on to give the guy making his sub the hardest time ever about how much lettuce he put on and how much to shake the oil and vinegar with seasoning so hes still insufferable

6255 2018-07-08 16:40:55 Did you know? Canola oil was originally called rapeseed oil, but rechristened by the Canadian oil industry in 1978 to avoid negative connotations. "Canola" is short for "Canadian oil." #funfoodfactoftheday

6267 2018-07-08 16:39:15 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
6268 2018-07-08 16:39:05 absolutely. h2 missed their spot. their only way now is to bruteforce with raw powerplay. the oil industry wants h2 to keep users locked in, and try to get gasstations to install it while blocking ev-chargers.. it's so sad to watch.

6287 2018-07-08 16:36:21 CBC won’t be happy until there is no economic activity in Alberta, no oil produced in Canada, and everyone is poor, cold, and in the dark. This federal government and any action plan or Paris agreement should work for Canadians, not the other way around.

6296 2018-07-08 16:35:21 If we form a cartel, and able to control prices, we will gain more but still have only 5% of the market value. Same with other commodities, oil inclusive. We need to look beyond commodity export and start building industries to gain from the value chain

6303 2018-07-08 16:33:58 So you would rather the oil come from Venezuela? Iran? Saudi Arabia? You'd prefer those countries to benefit from filling the demand?
6304 2018-07-08 16:33:49 Also, Venezuela’s fiscal problems are related to the drop in oil prices during the last 5 years.

6319 2018-07-08 16:31:22 Ridiculous! You’re linking selling oil to Asia to Human Rights? What does “environmental responsibility” even mean in the context of selling oil to Asia for money? Who cares where China gets their oil, compared with the Canadians mowed down to get it there!

The president does control prices to a large extent with reckless tweets about missiles flying and sanctions against 2 of the top 10 oil producers. Iran and Venezuela. Supply and demand. If he threaten war with Iran oil would spike.

6351 2018-07-08 16:28:46 Have you seen the state of the city of Glasgow? You still fly the Union Jack? Take a look around the dilapidated state Scotland is left in. Inquire why the UK gov controls Scotland's oil
6352 2018-07-08 16:28:43 True, but Truman signed the National Security Act in 1947 that created the CIA and while he was still president we backed the coup in Syria in 1949 that put in power a guy who approved construction for the Trans-Arabian Pipeline built and operated by American oil companies.
6353 2018-07-08 16:28:28 working with oil ain't the business .  I always had nice skin and now it's braking out all the time .  I hate it lmao .
6354 2018-07-08 16:28:26 I have, & am loving it. We should all be purchasing only
what we need. No extras. Saving at the same time. I expect to see rising prices soon. Especially gas, & oil prices on the rise. Thanks Baby Blimp.

6358 2018-07-08 16:27:55 Baby oil or coconut oil with that rub?
6359 2018-07-08 16:27:44 If you buy anything in a store, it got there by using oil or gas, but that knowledge seems to be way over your pay grade.
6360 2018-07-08 16:27:38 Thanks Juan. I remain skeptical. World demand for oil grows by about 1.5 million barrels a year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects increased world consumption of marketed energy from ALL fuel sources—except coal from now until 2040.
6361 2018-07-08 16:27:27 It’s not rocket surgery... bisquick water bit of oil in a hot pan cook eat enjoy
6362 2018-07-08 16:27:22 Cocoa butter or coconut oil. Worked wonders with my three pregnancies
6363 2018-07-08 16:27:15 Lettuce, roasted beetroot and pumpkin cubes, goats cheese and simple lemonjuice/olive oil dressing. I'm also really getting into yoghurt dressings made with a bit of natural yoghurt, lemon juice and herbs or flavours e.g. mustard.
6364 2018-07-08 16:26:51 I do appreciate the classic " don't like oil, don't use it" cache of photos  To back up the argument nobody is proposing.
6365 2018-07-08 16:26:50 He needs some #CBD OIL He will feel great after@worldhempire
6366 2018-07-08 16:26:46 This is the scam Tar Sands tries to use: Gee, if you use anything that has any oil involved, that somehow justifies Tar Sand. I don’t fall for your scam and the world shouldn’t either
6367 2018-07-08 16:26:32 In short. Yes. Because oil production is required, period. Producing it from a jurisdiction with the best human rights and environmental responsibility minimizes the impact. Where would you prefer the oil production to be?
6368 2018-07-08 16:26:30 The intersection we want to achieve is where alternative clean energy meets environmental protection.  We wouldn't need to drill for oil in Alaska , if we obtained our energy 100% from solar, wind, fuel cell, and yes, natural gas.

6375 2018-07-08 16:25:45 So I shaved my legs with coconut oil the other night. Idk how y’all do it
6376 2018-07-08 16:25:32 Careful while you wait on your oil change, Theodore.  Things tend to jump into your cart when you're browsing. You could make it home with fresh oil and some good deals! 
6377 2018-07-08 16:25:29 Keep hydrate and moisturise your skin. Will regulate sebum production. Skin often produces too much oil if not hydrated and moisturised

6385 2018-07-08 16:24:55 No oil slick...........
6386 2018-07-08 16:24:49 "Could one day be used for bridge inspections and oil spill monitoring" -- the video failed to mention the multi-trillion dollar markets of puppy rescue and rainbow observation. Neat vehicle though.
6387 2018-07-08 16:24:45 I'm curious, what medium do you use to create these preliminary images? Oil, or ???
6388 2018-07-08 16:24:38 Yes. Ppl are misled by bad or no reporting. Gas prices go up not because of supply but because of the inability to get oil to refineries. Younger ppl took no interest in skilled trades...we need ppl there too.
6389 2018-07-08 16:24:28 Here you go again! Just because someone anywhere in the world uses anything that is plastic does NOT justify Tar Sands. The world doesn’t need your oil. I could tell you the 10 things I do (solar, bicycle etc) but I won’t bother. I don’t use your dirty oil
6390 2018-07-08 16:24:27 Right. You're supposed to use a bit of regular "vegetable oil" for this one.
6391 2018-07-08 16:24:20 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
6392 2018-07-08 16:24:06 @MaryQVC I see those oil drizzling skills you have! Beautiful! Clearly not the first time you've done that.
6393 2018-07-08 16:23:53 And the light from the flash almost obscures the palm oil! Imagine all of this being poorer into a huge industrial vat!

6403 2018-07-08 16:22:32 We have so much of solar energy here in India but still having huge oil import bills and 50+% tax on fuel prices. Govt. is happily importing oil as they gain with taxes. We seriously need some solar companies here....and solar powered machines!
6404 2018-07-08 16:22:31 Forget complaining about KM it's now PM holding the reigns. 4.5 B for a  fossil fuel pipe and more than 3 x that for expansion. We elected a world environmental leader and got an oil baron instead. Will the carbon tax be enough or will CPP be gambled too
6405 2018-07-08 16:22:11 The Venus of Urbino is an oil painting by the Italian painter Titian, which seems to have been begun in 1532 or 1534, and was perhaps completed in 1534, but not sold until 1538.

6409 2018-07-08 16:21:40 So he and his corporate goonies can pillage marine territories governed by the U.S. for oil under the guise of “helping” the economy.
If previous oil spills and drilling events are to teach us anything, it’s that stuff like this never ends well for the wildlife.
6410 2018-07-08 16:21:40 nonsense. the man is a snake oil salesman, he should be labeled for what he is.
numbers dwindling... wtf are you on about?
6411 2018-07-08 16:21:39 Every time I read one of these stories and get down to the maths & volumes it just seems the new “innovation” comes down to being somewhere between snake oil reinventing an inefficient dehumidifier not practical with solar power.
6412 2018-07-08 16:21:28 And if they want to keep going, they will need to.  See, the left over here is pushing for fossil fuel reduction, which affects oil prices, and on top of that with gas prices going up that hurts OPEC.

It is in their best interest to listen to Trump on this.

6428 2018-07-08 16:19:04 You budgeted money from oil (not your own), next you want ancestral lands (not your own) just to build ranches for those you say are from Libya.

6440 2018-07-08 16:17:57 My uncle once told me about Doctors friend abroad that told him that organs are like oil money he said the man told him they got supplies from Africa but how he didn't explain the source , ppl are missing everyday guys stay safe and pray for God protection
6441 2018-07-08 16:17:41 You can also make your own halal mouth rinse, and of course don’t swallow it. Coconut oil, aloe vera juice, peppermint oil and cinnamon oil. Or just aloe vera juice and coconut oil.

6446 2018-07-08 16:17:11 Politicians often create subsidies for what is in their interests (corn, oil, gas, solar, wind, etc.)

But what is in everyone's best interest is that children are raised well...

So I favor subsidizing children, but in a reasonable, ethical, accountable manner

6480 2018-07-08 16:11:46 I started using essential oils about a year ago (I got a therapeutic grade oil not store bought) anyways maybe look into that? I inhale, diffuse & wear them now~especially when anxiety hits~but it’s less & less now. My son has less “melt downs” now too (not ASD diagnosed..yet)

6485 2018-07-08 16:11:19 You can almost smell the burning oil and hear the crunches from 4th to 3rd on the gearboxes 
6486 2018-07-08 16:11:16 These are crunchier. They are cooked in peanut oil instead of other, cut-rate, low-quality oils. They have just a hint of sea salt so that the peanut flavor shines.

6502 2018-07-08 16:08:52 2/2 So I vote we bring in surface supplied deep sea oil diving crews to see if they can widen the shafts.

And explore Elon Musk's plan for child sized mini-subs.

It will certainly give us something to talk about while we're waiting for the pumps to do their job.
6503 2018-07-08 16:08:34 It's a long time since we've had temperatures like this, it is waaaaay to hot! And yes, Norway is a quite expensive country.. Wonder how it would've been today if we hadn't discovered all the oil back in 1969 :b

6509 2018-07-08 16:07:43 Sounds like a bunch of hootenanny; US dollar ws backed by something real yet now aligned with Oil. Is there a healthier incentive than this currency?
6510 2018-07-08 16:07:40 been at work for 2 hours, ive billed out 4 oil changes and watch an hour and a half of fortnite streams.

6513 2018-07-08 16:07:13 Some coaches, post WW2, would put oil in a pool, set it on fire, and demand players swim under it

6534 2018-07-08 16:04:18 You can shallow fry as long as the oil is hot. You need to use a tempura style batter.

6538 2018-07-08 16:04:03 27 is not hard.  I get 23. If you’re eating free foods like chicken breast, seafood, fruits & vegetables, it’s easy. On a typical day, I spend my points on Siggi’s, iced coffee, salad dressing, avocado, crackers or popcorn, and olive oil. Maybe Halo Top.
6539 2018-07-08 16:03:58 you may need to use a hydrator AND a moisturizer (i use hyaluronic acid & rosehip seed oil). truly a game changer for my dry skin

6541 2018-07-08 16:03:45 Always oil, there’s no comparison. Use a cure if you want it dry by the same day.
6542 2018-07-08 16:03:42 Yes we need to diversify. No crude oil will not become obsolete. For many reasons including petrochemicals, bitumen kerosine. Jet fuel.
6543 2018-07-08 16:03:27 So why didn't we build a dam and fly in a pump that could pump 15000 gal an hour and let them walk out. Oh that right we only use that technology to get oil gold ect... Have a karma day.

6550 2018-07-08 16:02:59 New meal plan for days I cant be bothered to cook/figure out anything interesting: slice up a brick of tofu, add some frozen veggies, roast in the oven with some oil and seasoning ->  Good to go
6551 2018-07-08 16:02:59 How does electric anything lower energy bills? The electricity has to come from someplace, ie power plant! Power plants are power by coal, oil, or nuclear!
6552 2018-07-08 16:02:57 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?
6553 2018-07-08 16:02:51 None of that is true, idiot.  You could say the same thing about motor oil.
6554 2018-07-08 16:02:36 I live in Brazil and here I usually find a lot of good brands, you just have to make sure it's pure. When reading the ingredients/composition you must look for the ones that have exclusively castor oil (sometimes it comes w its scientific name)
6555 2018-07-08 16:02:35 俺もいつかなるんだろうな
6556 2018-07-08 16:02:33 I expect even a lay man would say the same. But these aren't a good days to be thinking solely oil. Tax should be no1. for any thriving economy in the world

6561 2018-07-08 16:02:09 Data is certainly more ecofriendly than oil or other types of assets. It takes up less space/energy to store, and is often used to reduce reliance on other assets/resources. E.g. UPS's ORION system saves 10m gal of fuel and 100k tons of CO2 by optimizing routes.

6569 2018-07-08 16:01:14 Same. My car is embarrassingly overdue for an oil change. For me it's the 'need to get up early enough in order to get to a state of being prepared to be away from the house for a few hours and actually get there with enough time to get in the queue' that keeps holding me back.

6585 2018-07-08 15:59:50 switchを買う理由にオクトパストラベラーが加わったが
6586 2018-07-08 15:59:48 All the Ferrari engines do that every race. It definitely doesn't seem right when there's a strict limit on oil comsumption. How are they complying unless this oil is coming from a concealed source
6587 2018-07-08 15:59:44 Akara, so I can use d oil as cream
6588 2018-07-08 15:59:27 หล่อมากค่ะ

6590 2018-07-08 15:59:12 I have him on seraquin at the moment but I’ve read that fish oil and butter is good
6591 2018-07-08 15:59:00 @rareseeds Advice, please. Spotted cucumber beetles. Will organic neem oil help?

6596 2018-07-08 15:58:27 Also stuff like salmon oil helps joints :-)
6597 2018-07-08 15:58:22 ヽ(´▽｀)/へへっ
6598 2018-07-08 15:58:19 Don’t mind me, just planning where to get my oil changed based on the coffee shop that has amazing oatmeal that I can get while I wait. Food is important.

6600 2018-07-08 15:58:13 Dry ok lagi dari oil.  Oily senang nak naik jerawat..  
6601 2018-07-08 15:58:05 And if Google is threatening the sanctity of the government's then it's time for the government's to give Google the old standard oil smash
6602 2018-07-08 15:57:47 Why are you ignoring what I say? Here’s another tactic trolls typically use to avoid the difficult questions: study my misdirection, ignore facts and talk exclusively within my frame of reference, they plead. No thanks. There is only one kind of “ethical oil.” #LeaveItInTheGround
6603 2018-07-08 15:57:45 Also, countries like Venanzuala with terrible govt leadership and high oild reserves ruin the country, due to greed. So the embargo on Pakastan another rich source of oil is really causing economic instability worldwide.
6604 2018-07-08 15:57:43 Is increasing oil sands activity, doubling up the #TMX for the purpose of increasing capacity to load oil tankers part of that “what needs to be done to fight climate change” @BlairKing_ca ? How does selling oil to Asia, which is what you’re lobbying for, fight climate change?
6605 2018-07-08 15:57:42 Its pity to have  engineer who is foolish.Yes its true that cash was siphoned to pay imports but calling them unnecessary is total wrong.Tell me which company was producing cooking oil and tissues in 2008.vaita kuti tishandise maguri echibage here kupisika.
6606 2018-07-08 15:57:42 Not only is US threatening every one to cut off oil supplies from Iran including its own allay EU but also india and threatning Iran with Sanctions and War for no fault of Iran , If Iran closes Straits of Hormuz as retaliation and Oil price goes to $150 then no one benefits
6607 2018-07-08 15:57:41 I don’t think it’s confusion but a well oil propaganda machine that has its roots in there education and upbringing. Turn on BBC on a Sunday night at 7pm and there’s always some program on that “confuses” the two.
6608 2018-07-08 15:57:39 If he's lucky, oil prices will rise; and he can get out of the whole Vision 2030 fantasy.
6609 2018-07-08 15:57:33 ''Good. I should tell you something.

I laced my lipstick with poison''
6610 2018-07-08 15:57:29 Depa almost consider time oil crash dulu
6611 2018-07-08 15:57:17 Number of air passengers will double in next couple of years/decades (if there is no peak oil). Even climatologists (not climate scientists!) in the Czech Republic were defending the "neccesity" of flying (and airport expansion). Am I desperate? You bet!
6612 2018-07-08 15:57:12 Mota ta yi - amma zan hada da phone, da charger & the code din..
6613 2018-07-08 15:57:07 So i washed my hair 2 days ago and since then i have dropped avocado dip, alcohol, hash browns and oil on it #clumsyashell
6614 2018-07-08 15:57:06 Mechanic: “You need brakes, tires, new engine.” 

I just want an oil change. PERIODT.
6615 2018-07-08 15:57:00 Holy shit! Literally laughed out loud! Goddam, Will.
6616 2018-07-08 15:56:55 This is seriously one of the most bizarre and hypocritical rants I’ve ever seen. A curse to your nation? Cancerous? Wow. Give your head a wobble lad. 29 years of ‘failure’...check your cabinet pre oil money and see what success you had then...unbelievable, Ken. Sterling 
6617 2018-07-08 15:56:44 The Way Nigerian Girls Like Guys With Cars Ehn,

6618 2018-07-08 15:56:40 わたしは間違っていない(๑• ̀ω•́๑)✧
6619 2018-07-08 15:56:35 In a country like India where wages are pathetic 30% direct tax is damn high. It is sheer extortion. Zero services are provided against these. 

Indirect #taxes r far more. Super High Duty on crude oil is to keep everything inflated.

Regimes are lavishing just by mining ppl.
6620 2018-07-08 15:56:06 9 diamond  oil trunk tv
6621 2018-07-08 15:56:01 Oil? Hmm well Hispaniola had volcanic rock activity. But oil isnt the route now, it doesnt have a future when most are changing towards alternative energies and may cause more future tremors.
6622 2018-07-08 15:55:57 I need to get my hands on some legit CBD oil!
6623 2018-07-08 15:55:52 Lol oil duh
6624 2018-07-08 15:55:39 สั่งไรมะรู้ ที่รู้คือสั่งขี้มูกอ่ะ แน่ๆ
6625 2018-07-08 15:55:39 Banana oil?
6626 2018-07-08 15:55:29 Never mind the bullshit where is Sotlands oil money
6627 2018-07-08 15:55:19 Somehow thought it would fine to wear oil all day sunbathing in 40 degree heat honestly mortified at how red I am 
6628 2018-07-08 15:55:18 There was one crust from a place that sears it in olive oil. I needed time alone with that one. 
6629 2018-07-08 15:55:04 Sir please talk about oil price.. people are laughing at you.. Except your own subject you always talk about others...
6630 2018-07-08 15:55:01 Oil money
6631 2018-07-08 15:54:53 ''Hmm..''

She soon pulled away.

''Like that?''
6632 2018-07-08 15:54:31 You’ve convinced me. I must try this face oil thingamy
6633 2018-07-08 15:54:11 Think of humanity as a Rubik's cube..
Each color is a different layer of vibration. 
The misplacement of energy creates an oil & vinegar effect in the human experience. 
#chaoskind
6634 2018-07-08 15:54:01 I am not interested in Norways oil money I want to know where Scotlands oil money went our weans are relying on food banks WHY
6635 2018-07-08 15:53:45 Oil dey your head jare
6636 2018-07-08 15:53:42 "It is but all in all I can't really change it. I'm an experiment."
6637 2018-07-08 15:53:34 I see in your bio, your a feminist. Can you change a tire, or oil in your car? Change a Electrical socket? Or do you delegate that to someone beneath you? Usually a man...
6638 2018-07-08 15:53:17 Unlike your reply though,  mine was not funded by  oil companies or peer-reviewed by sham scientists
6639 2018-07-08 15:53:11 Procedure it simple...

-Every night apply Vaseline to your eyelashes (and brows too if you want to grow those as well) 

-If you don’t have Vaseline you can apply coconut oil instead 

-Don’t apply too much or it will get in your eyes. Make sure to apply RIGHT BEFORE bed. 
6640 2018-07-08 15:52:55 Coconut oil.
6641 2018-07-08 15:52:48 The finest snake oil money can buy.
6642 2018-07-08 15:52:39 Yes she was.

She pressed her lips on his.
6643 2018-07-08 15:52:32 Aye, the NRA are assholes; alongside the oil companies, a huge reason why political lobbying should be outlawed. You shouldn't be able to buy politicians.
Unfortunately, whilst gun control quickly and easily took effect in most other western nations, the US is a bit too deep in
6644 2018-07-08 15:52:30 Our low carb brunch: sauteed kale in avocado oil and garlic. Cooked eggs in about a tbsp of butter (3 for Travis and 2 for me) then set them on the kale when they were done. Also pork sausage links.
6645 2018-07-08 15:52:29 Honor and trudeau is like OIL and water
6646 2018-07-08 15:52:24 I read something a while ago that basically said when we try to dry up our oily skin, it's all AWW HELL, WE NEED MORE OIL, whereas when we moisturize and hydrate the heck out of it, it calms down a bit on the oil production.

... they used more science based words though
6647 2018-07-08 15:52:02 “[Americans] are hostages to their lobbyists, to the mainstream media, to the huge corporations: financial, oil, armaments, etc. So they can tell you whatever you want to hear, but they will do the opposite.” - Bashar al-Assad
6648 2018-07-08 15:52:01 NOOOOOOOOOOOO I spilled a half bottle of beard oil on my Vapormax Plus 
6649 2018-07-08 15:51:57 There's a lot of oil I hear, among other things
6650 2018-07-08 15:51:55 When exactly will be a good time Gary? After ALL of the children in Flint die from cancer? After we help starve EVERYONE in Yemen? After we bring Venezuela to it's knees by glutting the oil market? After the ENTIRE Bill of Rights is cancelled? After We invade Syria? Iran?
6651 2018-07-08 15:51:48 who knows when am i gonna try and put this sketches on like clear canvas or sth. i wish i could paint, i bet theyd like awesome in oil paint
6652 2018-07-08 15:51:42 Something tells me that the sanctions will be lifted & the Rofsnet oil deal will happen. Too many corrupt players. Too much money....but we can make it right. Ultimately. 
6653 2018-07-08 15:51:15 Learn to change my cars oil 
6654 2018-07-08 15:51:04 Baby oil or lotion? S/O 2 @jnjcomm Love the Baby  Creamy oil with Aloe Vera! Wait ,I should have asked or said BOTH, haha
6655 2018-07-08 15:50:52 ... and olive oil, of course.
6656 2018-07-08 15:50:44 I didn’t know that the navy was contributing, link?
6657 2018-07-08 15:50:40 There is nothing like agenda here. The non oil sector development everyone is saying will open the economy is all dependent on the north. This is no Islamic agenda at all.
6658 2018-07-08 15:50:39 Where is Scotlands oil money
6659 2018-07-08 15:50:27 I actually wanted to write in Marathi but I have an English heart .. Let BB go to get oil.
6660 2018-07-08 15:50:01 @elicrafra when can I see you
6661 2018-07-08 15:49:56 #TheMancaveSmellsLike a high school boys locker room. So hubby makes sure he has those oil burners burning with that smell good.
6662 2018-07-08 15:49:52 She brought her face closer to his.
6663 2018-07-08 15:49:48 The root cause is izlam. 

No one forced iran and saudi to have governments 100% based on izlamic law, they did that on their volition; and were able to do it specifically because izlam is overly terrestrial in that sense.

The fact that they have oil, and sell it, is irrelevant.
6664 2018-07-08 15:49:44 My urine came back positive for pot about 8 weeks ago & new laws require Drs take you off benzos now when that happens!  So it was all a shock. 10 week taper. Already down to .5 mg a day until done. I feel great the last few days &work ft & only missed 1 day. Oil helps SO much.
6665 2018-07-08 15:49:33 Forgot I gotta get an oil change dang
6666 2018-07-08 15:49:31 I  ask Gordn Brown as the chancellor of the excheor how much money did scottish oil make during his time and where the fuk is the money
6667 2018-07-08 15:49:26 @elonmusk
6668 2018-07-08 15:49:24 Ok. I assume that there are kind o manipulation of western countries. Obviously with the intention to assure the supply of oil and resources. Do I got it right?
6669 2018-07-08 15:49:09 Don’t ever go there for an oil change it’s always forever. I used to take mine to Permian ford. You can Call and make an appt and they get you in & out.
6670 2018-07-08 15:49:08 Yes MMA's govt delivered! 
Exploration and then production of Oil and Gas in karak, hangu and bannu etc was initiated by MMA government through the agreements with well known companies such as MOL groups. 
KPK gets 37 Billion per year from it.

6676 2018-07-08 15:48:36 She placed a hand on his cheek.

''Hmm~''

6678 2018-07-08 15:48:14 Am having two pizzas made from tortilla wraps with ketchup, Extra Mature Cheddar, Stilton, Feta, green olives & pineapple on. With potato wedges and a salad of nowt but lettuce, onion, garlic olive oil and 'Salbamic' vinegar. #MeTea #eatingbitsandpieces
6679 2018-07-08 15:48:11 WANT KO PO NG PIZZA AND THEN BABY POTATOES IN OLIVE OIL THEN PASTA ESPAÑOLA OR MEATBALLS
6680 2018-07-08 15:47:58 With the rate at which sardine is reducing inside the tin, I won't be shocked if I open the next tin and just see oil & a note with the words "Sardine was here" inside 
6681 2018-07-08 15:47:35 Smell is a very powerful sense, the interior smell of an old mini & the old engine oil smell of an elderly Land Rover took me right back to my youth. #happydays #classiccars
6682 2018-07-08 15:47:26 And we'll never know the impact of some random Brit, Aussie, Canuck poster either. I'm betting some Canadian oil pipeline company probably had far more impact on the election than Russia, but that would hit too close to the wallet of the US MSM's sugar daddies.
6683 2018-07-08 15:47:26 Who else can relate? Waking up with aches and pains all over sucks Almost feels like 100 needles shooting down my neck, back, and knees. Trying out #CBD oil. Any thoughts on this stuff?
@FlyRts #healthylifestyle #HealthyLiving #FitnessChallenge #herbs #herbalifenutrition #Health
6684 2018-07-08 15:47:19 I always felt Xanax moreso just numbed me but with cbd oil I actually feel better.  I startee going to therapy also and that's  been a big help for my mental health as well! Np at all.  :)
6685 2018-07-08 15:47:19 At least I got my norco, CBD oil, and Tension Tamer is extremely good.
6686 2018-07-08 15:47:07 Oil pump alternatively water pump

6688 2018-07-08 15:46:55 Chef McElroy cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with grass.
6689 2018-07-08 15:46:37 Slow oven dried tomatoes tossed with thyme and garlic and olive oil.
6690 2018-07-08 15:46:27 Debatable, GDP growth didn't rise (see previous chart), real wage growth plummeted, our deficits doubled but unemployment did go down. Most economists actually believe the constriction in the money supply and oil prices were the drivers during that period.
6691 2018-07-08 15:46:26 Bay oil and shower 
6692 2018-07-07 23:59:59 Those are excellent sliced thin with a touch of oil and baked as crisps. But cake? Hmmm... *pondering thoughtful ears*
6693 2018-07-07 23:59:26 Yeah once my mum had a jug of olive oil sitting on the kitchen bench, I was really young and thought it was apple juice so poured a glass, puking ensued shortly after.

6728 2018-07-07 23:57:31 @Walmart the employees at y’all McCart location in Fort Worth Texas bout lazy as hell man. Why the hell is the mechanic that’s working on my car takin a break every 2 minutes. It don’t take an hour and a half to change no oil man!
6729 2018-07-07 23:57:29 That drives the market entirely..hence @POTUS asking for more oil to be produced..they are inflating the price of gas
6730 2018-07-07 23:57:13 roses used to be a less used one. both flowers oil and wood
6731 2018-07-07 23:57:10 To the extent that I see where you're coming from. It isn't as clear a choice, as I see it. If you let them go, even with the best of intentions, it empowers the corrupt political elite, and reinforces the notion that the rich are beyond the law. Corruption wins.
6732 2018-07-07 23:56:47 Oooooo ooo oil on the road
6733 2018-07-07 23:56:31 #VASC (Townsville) TCM (Race 2 of 3) policina done an oil pump hes out
6734 2018-07-07 23:56:28 If that’s the way to your heart I work in the oil rigs now
6735 2018-07-07 23:56:19 Islam attacking Christians ……. It's only their lifelong ambition.....
Born to do it...… Yet, our politicians love Islam...… 
Or is it oil they love.... I keep forgetting....
6736 2018-07-07 23:56:00 John D. Rockafeller, the oil tycoon, was the richest man in the modern world, who had a worth of what could be almost $660 Billion today.
6737 2018-07-07 23:55:36 Here I am thinking I bought coconut oil for my hair, but it's a fuckin Hair coat. Is it the same???
6738 2018-07-07 23:55:22 omg i love timothy the oil burning engine so excited
6739 2018-07-07 23:55:13 Vet said they were so insignificant that there was no need for any meds at the time, we used the oil and it greatly reduced how often they happened
6740 2018-07-07 23:54:59 Amen brother!  I never get tired of getting excited about Jesus!  He is coming soon for His Bride. I checked my oil and it is full. Lamp is ready.  Looking up daily.
6741 2018-07-07 23:54:56 What's not about oil or arms trade? US foreign policy.  LOL
6742 2018-07-07 23:54:51 Lol. Well I certainly won’t hire you as a lawyer. You clearly know nothing about evidence. By the way Africa is red like the rest of the world. Your corrupt oil baron sugar daddy will soon leave you and you’ll be a pub team again #plank
6743 2018-07-07 23:54:29 Yes, ours has petite maul seizures, CBD oil has worked wonders for her.
6744 2018-07-07 23:54:12 I am so passionate about kale put some pepper, fresh garlic, a little olive oil & lemon juice hooooooomygod
6745 2018-07-07 23:53:44 Yeah? Or you’re just agreeing ?
6746 2018-07-07 23:53:43 That of course contributes, but we have one province that holds 1/3 of the total population.  It doesn't have an oil industry, a fishing industry or a lumber industry.  We have to start thinking about redistributing the humans.
6747 2018-07-07 23:53:39 A corn dog is just an undercover weenie.
6748 2018-07-07 23:53:35 It moght be a problem that his predecessor allowed TX drillers to buy blocks that were currently owned by Mexico.....See US federal oil and gas leases 2014-2017 @ENERGY
6749 2018-07-07 23:53:32 Man, I heard some bs but "lower quality of life" from wind turbines, is absolutely nuts. Sounds like a survey by the oil and gas industry.
6750 2018-07-07 23:53:21 Except that's not really an available option here. You're either going to get the sidekick and strengthen the bully, or you're going to let the sidekick get away with her stealing and deal the bully a blow. Holding the bully accountable isn't an available option at this time.
6751 2018-07-07 23:52:58 I can't wait to turn 18 honestly

6754 2018-07-07 23:52:19 The shilling is receiving a consistent pounding from devalutation after rate hike from foreign lending and all time high of the crude oil prices, with the current budget 2018/19, could lead to an a year of slow economic growth and cut back of losses from local lenders to sustain
6755 2018-07-07 23:52:18 don’t you love going to get an oil change and finding out there are a myriad of other problems with your car 
6756 2018-07-07 23:51:59 Oil is money and that rules the World.
6757 2018-07-07 23:51:53 This is our second spot and both places are out of oil
6758 2018-07-07 23:51:35 That's a part of it, I'm talking about the extra military that keeps our oil supply safe.

6762 2018-07-07 23:50:27 Sucker!  Believed the snake oil salesman.
6763 2018-07-07 23:49:52 Every time, I always bring  oil after giving my  a . #ItMeltedMy  as it becomes clarified
6764 2018-07-07 23:49:43 Oh this is with the vape oil pods instead. I would get annoyed with that too!
6765 2018-07-07 23:49:37 Cute that you follow studies funded by oil/gas corporations.
6766 2018-07-07 23:49:37 Oh yea......it’s here.......so I looked on YouTube to see how to replace my oil pan and there was no video .....so I’m going to create and upload one Sunday  ........#beremembered#leavealegacy
6767 2018-07-07 23:49:23 They're one coconut oil tweet away from being blocked
6768 2018-07-07 23:49:16 what did young adults do before cell phones? figure out what oil to buy for their cars WITHOUT panic calling their parents??? sounds fake
6769 2018-07-07 23:49:13 I just spent all but $0.66 of my birthday bonus on an oil change and new windshield wipers
…and I’m PUMPED because that means none of my actual hard-earned money was spent YEAH WOO-HOO lolololololol who have I become

6771 2018-07-07 23:49:08 Right in keeping with repealing reforms to regulate and oversee offshore oil and gas drilling.  Apparently Deepwater Horizon didn't do enough damage.
6772 2018-07-07 23:48:56 pressure them for concessions, such as oh, Iunno, forcing them to accept our oil companies. They would be on their own with Latin America, and uh-oh! You know what THAAAAT means! We could sell them so much weaponry and expertise, while inspecting them. Foreign aid and prop. 2/
6773 2018-07-07 23:48:51 Granted we have meddled in other governments insisting on human rights and liberty. Sadly it was usually because they also had oil or other resources instead of simply being because of morality. Now though we are a caliphate of sorts just based on the Bible instead of the Quran.
6774 2018-07-07 23:48:38 In other words, they are the 5 unwise virgins. They lack oil. 
The devil makes us keep believing we are alright cos we've answered the altar call, meanwhile we ain't. And like the unwise virgins, we'd be shot out into outer darkness on the day of bridegroom's coming.
6775 2018-07-07 23:48:28 So some human beings actually eat yam and groundout oil......
6776 2018-07-07 23:48:10 The government believes in GOD: Guns, Oil, and Drugs.
6777 2018-07-07 23:47:45 Kiir also is in a desperate need for the oil, at least to pay for his militias! On the other hand, Machar wanted to be freed from his 2 years house arrest in S. Africa &reach deal before it's too late! The regional&international players cannot afford a failed state in S. Sudan!
6778 2018-07-07 23:47:06 Get the kingpin; put mule on probation. Country wins.
6779 2018-07-07 23:47:01 i get this all the time because i have sensitive skin and the way i manage is with loooots of unperfumed lotion. if you don’t have lotion, olive oil will work in a pinch if you have access to that? honestly the only thing you can do, to my knowledge, is moisturize :/

6781 2018-07-07 23:46:17 It's not about oil or arms trade.
6782 2018-07-07 23:45:59 He cancelled a crucial meeting scheduled  with Indian counterpart over Iran oil. Imagine the urgency and the outcome is zero. Trump is finally realised people are watching him. His magical tricks are failing him.
6783 2018-07-07 23:45:57 Tough choices. I'd give the mule a plea, sure. Would I let him go scot free, though, if I knew I had enough to send him down? Even if not doing that may mean the kingpin walks for now?  That's a tougher decision.
6784 2018-07-07 23:45:52 If the body is a temple, the tattoos are the frescos, the sculptures, the engravings and gold leafed frames on masterwork oil painted saints lovingly cultivated by the temple's wealthy patron.

Above all and before all else, the Oil teaches you how to continue in intimacy with Christ.

6804 2018-07-07 23:42:00 Look if you were in the DA’s office you’d give the mule a plea bargain to get the kingpin? These are choices we make in an imperfect world.
6805 2018-07-07 23:41:40 The Venezuelan government fucked up oil management so hard they literally don’t have the economic stability to even find people to drill enough oil out to pay off their debts- not even the other anti-West nations like China and Russia don’t wanna help them out of their debt
6806 2018-07-07 23:41:27 Freedom? Well we prefer freely breathing clean air, freely walking down the street, freely listening to all points of view, freely expressing my point of view, looking at untouched wilderness freely without oil rigs and mining, freely looking across the Rio Grande. How's that?
6807 2018-07-07 23:41:19 @BingingWBabish video for gumbo says 1/2 cup flour but recipe online says 1 cup. What's the right amount? I think 2:1 flour to oil?

6815 2018-07-07 23:39:57 They didn’t stop highlighting the fact we paid more in the kitty for many years for no reason & enjoy highlighting it for the last few years. As an economist friend from the Treasury told me the economy goes up & down just like the UK. Oil is worth $100 now with production halved
6816 2018-07-07 23:39:39 I literally have no idea how we go through Hellmann's so fast. Yeah, real mayo. Don't @ me. If you don't like delicious soybean oil, eggs, vinegar, lemon and of course salt you can unfollow me right off here.

6823 2018-07-07 23:38:14 When my dad was dying, CBD oil was the only thing that gave him an appetite and eased his nausea. It’s a great medicine for many.

6828 2018-07-07 23:37:10 Just curious, Omar, but you don't look like someone rolling in the dough. Why do you defend US imperialism? You got stock in the arms industry, how about oil. Boeing, MIC? You probably aren't earning minimum wage? How much does trolling pay?
6829 2018-07-07 23:37:07 What about you and your car  no oil.
6830 2018-07-07 23:36:55 i can’t flip pancakes for shit so the oil splashed onto my leg oof
6831 2018-07-07 23:36:53 I can’t comprehend people who are vegan and consume products containing palm oil (or other devastating ingredient(s)). That’s totally paradoxical. I mean,  too many species die because of this oil, and “that” should be a preoccupation for those vegans...

6840 2018-07-07 23:35:06 I use Copaiba oil instead. It's 40% stronger and works on the same receptors in the endocannabinoid System as CBD. Quality matters tremendously to effectiveness. Plus no legal issues to worry about.
6841 2018-07-07 23:35:01 I put lavender and eucalyptus oil on the bottom of my feet after my shower... my mind and soul is at ease right now

6850 2018-07-07 23:32:50 Sounds lovely. I like the idea of using the oil from the tomatoes to brush on the filo!
6851 2018-07-07 23:32:19 Even if, in the meantime, she consolidates her hold on power, disposes exposed assets, hides wealth? And what if she wins again? By hook or by crook. Wait to complete tenure again?

6862 2018-07-07 23:30:34 There will be no further operations in the Europe Russia just lost their window to do anything this year the only viable option for them is dig in and try to collect as much oil revenue as possible.

6865 2018-07-07 23:29:38 Even prosecutors exercise discretion as to when and what to prosecute based on the public interest. Why do I need so much metaphor, Ahmer?
6866 2018-07-07 23:29:36 Know it’s hot when the coconut oil is 100% liquid in the jar
6867 2018-07-07 23:29:35 Pruitt was too soft and green, I had to let him go.  Wheeler is much,  much tougher on environment and climate. I don't have to pay him, he is already on Big Oil payroll.
6868 2018-07-07 23:28:43 hold sidekick accountable after tenure; possession is a crime but it need not come at expense of understanding criminal justice system.
6869 2018-07-07 23:28:41 you’d be lying if you said taking a shower, then putting coconut oil all over your body, after a long day of laying out at the pool isn’t the greatest feeling ever.

6875 2018-07-07 23:27:47 when a trashfire burns long enough you have to wonder if it's actually a cleverly disguised oil well
6876 2018-07-07 23:27:42 This Burberry fragrance for men I just got in the mail. Man...men been asking me for a oil for them and a new beard balm scent.
6877 2018-07-07 23:27:40 That's good.
6878 2018-07-07 23:27:38 Bit worrying. They've probably found some other way of burning oil seen as all Ferrari powered cars found the speed.
6879 2018-07-07 23:27:31 i've always said the only thing a fighter of any gender should have to wear is a healthy coating of body oil
6880 2018-07-07 23:27:29 I got this oil diffuser cranking. @HeyFranHey I’m coming for you sis 
6881 2018-07-07 23:27:07 la MUD es la responsable junto con todas las mesas de dialogo en venezuela y fuera de ella de el inmenso desastre que vive ese pais en manos de los narcocastrochavistas.
6882 2018-07-07 23:26:55 Yes,same company and position.
6883 2018-07-07 23:26:17 Girl! I’ve got this oil that I put on mine and in a month they were so much better!
6884 2018-07-07 23:26:12 Mashallah.
6885 2018-07-07 23:26:09 Yall only like dark skinned girls when they're covered in baby oil or in bright colors.
6886 2018-07-07 23:25:47 Life lessons learned from things that have spilled in my suitcase: tea tree oil and coffee beans mixed together is not a good fragrance.
6887 2018-07-07 23:25:36 "Hooray for good old fashioned oil"
6888 2018-07-07 23:25:33 the fossils of animals that lived millions years ago becomes oil
6889 2018-07-07 23:25:19 Even if that means the sidekick gets away with her crimes?
6890 2018-07-07 23:25:09 I’ll put my hair into 8 braids or twists after washing. After two days, I’ll wear it out, then moisturize with Elasta QP Mango Olive Oil butter or moisturizer then do 4 braids. I’ll either wear it out again which gives me hair like in my avi or just wash after 2-3 days.
6891 2018-07-07 23:24:57 and of course like the oil meme going around
6892 2018-07-07 23:24:27 Mine was pure hubris and seafood cooked in thc oil.
6893 2018-07-07 23:24:11 si el gobierno de venezuela negocia pdvsa con china se pedira un referendum consultivo de interes nacional.
6894 2018-07-07 23:24:07 Anno jamaica dat love .. pay attention to the products in the background( such as the cooking oil) m.. dem de nuh sell a yard !
6895 2018-07-07 23:23:59 I hear they put highlights in a  Big Mac box laced with oil the fries were cooked in. They think he’ll digest the highlights by eating the paper.
6896 2018-07-07 23:23:55 This guy is just a pseudo intellectual snake oil salesman, he's sees racism everywhere because without it he's out of a job. Cultures cater to their dominant demographics, there's no supremacy involved it's just statistics. If we're so oppressive why does he have a platform?
6897 2018-07-07 23:23:52 My aunt was into natural and vitamins and all that stuff while I was growing up. She had me drinking sesame oil, COD liver oil and all sorts of things. Bothersome but compliments were my thing during high school. 

So i stuck with it. When I tell people I’ve never had a pimple 
6898 2018-07-07 23:23:40 It’s not like essential oil salts like I thought cuz it had no smell to it before or after water mixed with it.
6899 2018-07-07 23:23:30 Fresh oil change.....let’s ride baby

6901 2018-07-07 23:23:11 Suggestion... Did you try Cannabis oil ?  or just CDB oil...  Depending on your state you might try the Cannabis oil as the active ingredient THC is the one that is more of a pain control compound ..  I have had several surgeries to my face >>>>
6902 2018-07-07 23:23:04 Beard oil 
6903 2018-07-07 23:23:02 I'll pay you to change my oil 
6904 2018-07-07 23:22:52 Once he’s done with Ukraine, maybe Putin will turn his attention to Croatia. Surely Luka Modrić is worth more than all the oil in Crimea. If Putin succeeds in his takeover bid (and Croatia wins the World Cup), Putin will certainly want to claim the Cup for Russia retroactively.
6905 2018-07-07 23:22:37 Add beans, fiber, fish (instead of meat), nuts, grains and soy to your diet to lower cholesterol. You can also get omega-3 fish oil otc supplement. If you put them in the freezer you’ll avoid the aftertaste.
6906 2018-07-07 23:22:32 Trying to force through a super non-eco oil pipeline, and now trying to get into the weed game. Corporations are really coming hard for vancouver culture rn
6907 2018-07-07 23:22:28 Aye. We always bomb for nothing. Well... oil and minerals and colonial expansion... just not the made up stories about nasty dictators they peddle.
6908 2018-07-07 23:21:55 1970s was a combo of things - oil price shocks, union wage demands, US Vietnam war spending rippling through the fixed exchange rate era of Bretton Woods. 1970s was the last period for mature, stable democratic nations seeing high rates of inflation.

6913 2018-07-07 23:20:48 ? Um not sure what your point is.  I was just relying to you assertion that 3% are funded by petroleum.  Really though the 97% isn’t an actual number it’s just what people say.  And agriculture probably would also be in the anti side as well but easier to say big oil
6914 2018-07-07 23:20:47 I put this peppermint oil on my scalp and it feels like my scalp done raised off my head
6915 2018-07-07 23:20:38 Imagine thinking that the most powerful country on Earth and its environmental agency have nothing to do with the fate of the earth.  Imagine being that nuts.
6916 2018-07-07 23:20:25 bitch I can change my oil 
6917 2018-07-07 23:20:18 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
6918 2018-07-07 23:20:09 This lady at work asked me what kind foundation do I have on today.. I said I don’t have no face makeup  on just oil on my face she said wow your skin is so beautiful 
6919 2018-07-07 23:20:09 The Stass is handing out sass like a mailman handing out letter coupons for half off an oil change.
6920 2018-07-07 23:20:07 Sure!//
6921 2018-07-07 23:20:04 I did a lot of research on things before taking the plunge. Water, oil, sugar and flour make the dough. Fried in oil, with cinnamon and sugar after. All vegan!!!

6926 2018-07-07 23:19:48 exactly. I knew about coconut oil but it never crossed my mind to use olive oil too. I use coconut oil on my hair too, as a pre-poo. It sort of protects the hair. It’s awesome too. I love natural stuff.
6927 2018-07-07 23:19:46 is the world that hard up for oil n gas?

6934 2018-07-07 23:19:08 American's trapped in hotel amid rioting and violence in Haiti
Why? Because of High Oil prices (Gas) 45 has run up the price of oil from $45 to $75 for Russia and Saudi Arabia and put through a $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy. He did the 2 things he was HIRED to do BY PUTIN
6935 2018-07-07 23:18:54 Trumps Iran sanctions caused world oil prices to rise. Major beneficiaries are Russia and Saudi’s. Haiti riots protesting rising oil prices. Americans trapped in hotel(100+) by riots. Trumps brain farts cause destruction world wide. He should realize his stupidity costs lives
6936 2018-07-07 23:18:37 Yes my child when he said"I didn't do nothing, I promise Penny did it"after I found him with a gallon of vegetable oil dumped on him with the jug next to him&the dog laying just far enough away to not get oily.

6938 2018-07-07 23:17:47 Mike CBD oil is great for body aches for joint aches for pain in your back and it also stops seizures calms people down but it doesn't make you high it makes your body high so you can still function as  A regular person!
6939 2018-07-07 23:17:38 I use coconut oil to take off my makeup and olive oil to detangle and moisturize my hair. 

If you use makeup remover you be there forever wanting to cry cus you just wanna go to sleep.
6940 2018-07-07 23:17:35 Yes, the Deal is largely  about Bashir’s own personal survival; it is about exploiting S.Sudan's oil to save himself from  an imminent " hungry uprising.” Therefore, the prime responsibility of saving S. Sudan from total failure lies with the S.Sudanese people.
6941 2018-07-07 23:17:24 Luckily the 3-in-1 oil is nearby.

Sigh. She requires probiotic gravy, coconut oil, salmon oil ea morning;  can only eat salmon, tuna, rabbit or duck, ($4-5/can), and she insists on having weekly laser treatments, ($40/pop.)

6951 2018-07-07 23:15:24 I sell cbd oil in my shop in Texas. I don't make it so I'm not off the charts knowledgeable on it but I'm very familiar with it. It is extremely helpful to tons of people for tons of different symptoms.
6952 2018-07-07 23:15:21 I take CBD oil on a regular basis I'm 50, I was extremely sick and I hurt all over. It's the only thing that works no percocet for me know thank you!
 It never ceases to amaze me that marijuana should be legal for medical purposes only.

6961 2018-07-07 23:13:57 Yet TRUMP Fossil Fuel expansion agenda along with Putin puts tens of thousands of pipelines and oil platforms across our coastlines , Natl . Parks , Public Lands  , Alaskan Tundra ignoring devastation from extreme weather and denying climate change .

6973 2018-07-07 23:12:15 Every good detective& anyone smarter than a stone..knows, first place to look is motive.

What's Big Oil's motive?  Tens of billions $$

What are motives of those who believe there's climate change, including most scientists?

Being a liberal?
Just because..
Or fact-based concern
6974 2018-07-07 23:12:12 i just use jamaican black castor oil, i heat it up then apply to my scalp then on my hair and sit with a plastic bag for about 35-40 minutes (i have 4c hair so i sit longer cuz my shit thick)
6975 2018-07-07 23:11:54 I just used olive oil to take off my makeup and lemme tell you it’s awesome. My skin is so smooth, it doesn’t clog the pores plus, it’s actually good for the skin. I’m never again spending money on makeup remover. Sign in to my beauty channel for more tips. 
6976 2018-07-07 23:11:53 Um mm...no coconut oil is for tanning (ahem burning). Seriously do I need to buy you all sunscreen?  Don't tempt me. I will

6980 2018-07-07 23:11:14 Yup, it’s all about the oil. There’s a reason the GOP is full of climate change deniers.
6981 2018-07-07 23:11:09 I really hope we get to the outdoor naked oil wrestling show toniiiiiight oh my god I AM TOO HYPED FOR THIS
6982 2018-07-07 23:11:08 Yep, no expensive offshore drilling for quite a while. But very easy to frak at right price—geology is known, directional radial drilling hits 100%. Problem is transport of oil: rail & truck expensive & limited capacity. Not enough pipelines in ND or TX. Will read Bloomberg

6985 2018-07-07 23:10:57 Oh it’s more technique then recipie, I use it for fridge clearing. Oil/fat, protein, seasoning, acid, base. 

You basically cook everything separately and combine them at the end while you make rice - it makes a good long lasting pot o’ stew.
6986 2018-07-07 23:10:55 affecting: 55% of vegetable oil is made from soybean oil,almost every margarine& shortening. mayonnaise, salad dressings,& preservatives.important role in production of biofuels.represents 2/3 of the protein in livestock grain around world.plant-based replacement of dairy or meat
6987 2018-07-07 23:10:44 Nah, they need dem exogenous ketones and mct to oil to access them 
6988 2018-07-07 23:10:40 It's nearly perfect in the winter too, but switches to burning oil when the price of gas is high. In both cases, Millstone just keeps chugging away.

6995 2018-07-07 23:09:12 @beautyandplanet I recently used the argan oil & lavender and had an allergic. I sent a customer service request via website last week and haven't heard anything back. I've used both argan oil and lavender before. Wonder why your brand gave me an allergic reaction?? 
6996 2018-07-07 23:08:50 and “data is the new oil”

your personal data (incl social media) and
business data (in the cloud and on-premise)

those who have the data can predict and manipulate the future like
results of elections
up and down of share prices 
immigration, wars, ...

follow the data & money

7002 2018-07-07 23:08:17 Big oil contribute more to Hillary!
7003 2018-07-07 23:07:42 Doesn’t make sense from an economic perspective for two reasons:
1- Price of oil is completely related to international markets and can go up (costing treasury) or down (costing citizens)
2- exchange rate can vary (likely get worse) and oil is denominated in dollars.

7005 2018-07-07 23:07:28 is it actually like oil or is it grease?
7006 2018-07-07 23:07:23 I put oil on my face. Why would I think this was ok. Literally a dumb ass
7007 2018-07-07 23:07:08 That $15B a year figure has been debunked. It was from a Scotiabank report that had several false assumptions. 

The money is there. If we can funnel $3.5B a year to big oil and continue to pay the health costs from fossil fuel pollution, we can fund a renewable revolution.
7008 2018-07-07 23:07:01 I really dislike business who have shady practices. Getting swindled on an oil change is a way to make me really mad fast!

7011 2018-07-07 23:06:45 I voted out pure hemp oil lip balm because it goes rancid too quickly. I use the hemp oil in my smoothies instead.

7012 2018-07-07 23:06:43 Well got daam how much oil yall putting
7013 2018-07-07 23:06:37 Scalp oil
7014 2018-07-07 23:05:57 Why are Oreos made with bone char sugar and palm oil it’s so easy to use plain cane sugar and a different type of oil
7015 2018-07-07 23:05:49 Baby potatoes, tossed in oil and salt, roasted in the air fryer. Clean simple food, boring as dirt, and I will kill you with a smile on my face if you try to take it away from me.
7016 2018-07-07 23:05:39 Lol. I laugh in fat & oil
7017 2018-07-07 23:05:29 For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey. Deuteronomy 8:7-8
7018 2018-07-07 23:05:24 Just picked up the @Elemis @qvcuk TSV. Cannot pass up a marine cream! Looking forward to trying the oil @keeleyelemis
7019 2018-07-07 23:04:46 I am getting tired of all the hugot like... kailangan mo ba talaga isingit yang hugot mo sa usapan natin about oil price hike??? Come on kArEn
7020 2018-07-07 23:04:13 Olive oil contains healing properties, 
Holy water is made from olive oil
7021 2018-07-07 23:04:01 I know people are sceptical but look into Rick simpson oil , or Thc & Cbd oil for cancer, get past the mainstream media and look online. Thoughts & prayers 
7022 2018-07-07 23:03:54 Sad but true. We have to vote them out in November. If you have been to Russia, you know. It is no way close to our democracy to how we all enjoy life here. Pray it won’t take too many years to clean up from trade wars, brain drain, and pollutions. It’s all about oil.
7023 2018-07-07 23:03:44 ridiculous. Oil is oil and sugar is sugar. Genetically modified sugarbeets have significantly increased yields, allowed for reduced tillage, and improved soil health practices. #personalexperience #techisyourfriend
7024 2018-07-07 23:03:11 Interesting. Do I have this right, that the biggest US growth is in oil-free, renewable-resource-reliant, environmentally conscious Washington State? Well, they do have an oil refinery, and a pipeline, I think. Still, this does put Washington's resistance to #TMX in context.
7025 2018-07-07 23:03:05 I had thoughts of both "bring your book" and "bring your laptop" but "oil changes are quick" was the voice that prevailed.
7026 2018-07-07 23:03:01 Teatree Oil!!! Sorry girly!
7027 2018-07-07 23:02:56 DJT and Putin plus our EPA want us at one very dependent on oil. Could it be that Russia has a large untapped oil reserve. As long as fossil fuel is king, they get richer.
7028 2018-07-07 23:02:54 @Techno_Oil I am a licensed petroleum wholesaler here in South Africa interested to resell your products.
7029 2018-07-07 23:02:40 FOOLS, I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED COCONUT OIL ANALYTICS

7031 2018-07-07 23:02:34 I’ll never forget the first time I saw that oil painting and thought, is that @Vajayjayabrams grandfather? Or Barry from storage wars?
7032 2018-07-07 23:02:26 If oil and gas prices come back, NDP will look like heroes. Not sure that's a good bet, and Klein already sold the farm, so we could be in tough times for awhile if their bet is wrong.
7033 2018-07-07 23:02:20 yeah  however  other countries have other options to buy oil or gas , that is the summary
7034 2018-07-07 23:02:15 Spent a part of the afternoon starting Cities Skylines with @anya_fennec. We were derping around, but I think the city ended up pretty okay so far...except the southern reaches connected by a perilous bridge and filled with oil fields and a prison right across from a cemetery.
7035 2018-07-07 23:02:04 Baby oil is so ironic cause it smells like anal...
7036 2018-07-07 23:01:57 I swear I'm not grimy I just accidentally put too much coconut oil in my hair don't look at me
7037 2018-07-07 23:01:51 Guy at Walmart: do you know what hair serum is?
Me: like hair oil?
Him: *shows picture of biosilk * my gf wants this
Me: oh yea that’s right here...oo they only sell the pack they don’t have the singles
Him: I’ll just have to get the pack, can’t go home empty handed
Me: 
7038 2018-07-07 23:01:37 Looks good. FYI most fried food is cooked in fryers that share oil with meat products i.e. not vegan.
7039 2018-07-07 23:01:35 Oil change and a smog check for 19 dollars. Can’t believe the deals you can find in Vegas for almost anything.
7040 2018-07-07 23:01:34 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
7041 2018-07-07 23:01:20 I bought an essential oil diffuser and now im broke ayyyy
7042 2018-07-07 23:01:10 Good luck he is a fucking snake oil salesman.
7043 2018-07-07 23:00:57 For once oil spill and petrotrin  is not to blame. Thank God
7044 2018-07-07 23:00:39 Dept of Trans estimates at an avg mileage of 25 mpg,  a single #EV can displace about 468 gallons of gas per yr, or 25 Barrels of #oil
With our #EV I think I calculated we displace 32 barrels of oil!
7045 2018-07-07 23:00:38 Palm oil?   Never would have associated the two.
7046 2018-07-07 23:00:36 2

A criminal regime based on fascism, 

A criminal regime who denies basic Human Rights from women.

A criminal regime which killed students in 1999 by @rouhani_ir order.

7047 2018-07-07 23:00:32 Try surprising enemies with a bucket full of boiling-hot oil as soon as it exceeds 100%.

7049 2018-07-07 22:58:55 y’all need CBD oil in your lives it’s some big brain shit
7050 2018-07-07 22:58:22 How many climate deniers have their own fallout shelters and food reserves for when the oil dries up ?  #InterestingMetric
7051 2018-07-07 22:58:21 I'm gonna bless this oil blend that I'm about to make up from some Jezebel oil, patchouli, prosperity oil and some none of your business. Then I'm going to do my makeup. I'm painting a Picasso on this mug tonight. I'm playing no games.
7052 2018-07-07 22:58:19 Wrong. It’s space oil this time.
7053 2018-07-07 22:58:09 Whatever your past and however tainted your halo, if you expose the bully, even inadvertently, the bully will digress; make it about bully.
7054 2018-07-07 22:58:06 I’ve never tried CBD oil but I’ve heard tons about it!
7055 2018-07-07 22:57:56 I call on sudanese belligerants.  Stop this in insane waste of energy and spill of blood. Lets use the NRG of the youth in noble cause such as mega civil engineering prjects like railways and oil pipelines to indian ocean with countless for former rebels and soldiers

7058 2018-07-07 22:57:38 Kalamata olive oil is truly the superior olive oil
7059 2018-07-07 22:57:31 ..politics is the art of the snake-oil-salesman..always has been and always will be..who and how many will bite and buy in to your wares..?
..Trump is doing nothing that hasn't been tried before,maybe the latest perfection..
..medicine never tastes good..
7060 2018-07-07 22:57:22 Scenario: your chain saw needs a 40:1 mixture of gas to oil. If you put .9 gallon in the gas can, how much oil goes in the mix?  How many recent non-STEM college graduates with or without a calculator can solve the problem? How many even own a chain saw?
7061 2018-07-07 22:56:42 Lmao barely  My hair really curly so it’ll be like 3 more months bf it get there lol but I use castor oil too. I just hate that I can’t wash my hair like I used to bc they might unravel
7062 2018-07-07 22:56:40 In this crazy time I force my will on the world I live in to make sense to me.
Never give in never back down.
7063 2018-07-07 22:56:39 I made the trip to Indianapolis to watch an @IndyEleven match against the Charlotte Independence at Lucas Oil Stadium. They are expecting 9,000 at tonight's contest with the roof open.
7064 2018-07-07 22:56:18 I bought Mason a really nice Grunt Style sweatshirt for Christmas and while in Cali I found out he cut the sleeves off to wipe his butt while he was in the field...now he uses it as a rag to wipe motor oil on  no more nice things for him.
7065 2018-07-07 22:56:17 Well, we could shut off oil. Jason Kenney thought that's how to teach BC a lesson. And the dippers joined that bandwagon. You think that'll work with the US? I don't.
7066 2018-07-07 22:56:10 Yeah, i realise. In this instance i was trying to see if could do it by eye as I've been doing a bunch of oil painting. I'm experimenting with how the discipline translates over to digital.
7067 2018-07-07 22:56:06 It’s doesn’t give your decisions. Oil and water can’t be in same position/label
7068 2018-07-07 22:56:05 Keystone Vapors’s “Island” flavor CBD oil tastes like ass sweat filtered through a pineapple rind, do not recommend.
7069 2018-07-07 22:55:47 Not really,  they were picky about getting oil in there fur and matting it down. 
7070 2018-07-07 22:55:46 Most of them seem to believe Dave King wrote that statement.....   FFS, if we could find a way to turn stupidity into energy, we could dispense with North Sea oil altogether...
7071 2018-07-07 22:55:37 Also big big fan of fresh squid ink pasta, sauce w garlic and olive oil and herbs
7072 2018-07-07 22:55:36 Shorter hair also traps less steam engine oil, which is an advantage, though if I died my hair green I guess it would be less noticeable.
7073 2018-07-07 22:55:22 sex toys and hot oil yea I'm fucking with all that
7074 2018-07-07 22:55:11 And he still want to get that oil rig painting for her damn

7078 2018-07-07 22:54:40 Hurt my soul to go get this oil change and have to pay for it 
7079 2018-07-07 22:54:05 Weigh out nine scoops of olive oil and allow to simmer.

7081 2018-07-07 22:53:51 There's no sustainable peace for S. Sudan people and nobody care about that, it's all about the oil.
7082 2018-07-07 22:53:35 So were you vocal when multiple conservative governments ran deficits while oil was high and services were cut?
7083 2018-07-07 22:53:34 มีดราม่าให้เสือกโว้ยยยยย
7084 2018-07-07 22:53:20 “There’s oil in that suppository.”

“No, i made it up.”
Tori: “Well a suppository is a pill you put up your butt.”
“Oh.”
7085 2018-07-07 22:53:05 Oh yea you almost at ya full locking point. Might have to add that to the routine cause that Cantu & Castor oil come in clutch

7091 2018-07-07 22:51:50 Conservative here- we need to be doing more to help protect our environment. While I don’t agree with most of @ChicoState political values I do agree with them on this! So unfortunate about oil companies moving into Alaska. One spill and it’s over.  smh
7092 2018-07-07 22:51:49 Stop using palm oil.
7093 2018-07-07 22:51:48 Because Mexico doesn’t have oil?
7094 2018-07-07 22:51:30 I did that last year and still have oil burns.

7097 2018-07-07 22:50:31 You Donnie are the one peddling Fake News in order to distract from the truth. Sell your snake oil to your loverboy Putin.
7098 2018-07-07 22:50:17 Or dig out a deep deep channel and bring in oil drilling teams to make a drain...if they can dig in the ocean they can dig in water logged terrain
7099 2018-07-07 22:50:05 I like to rub it on the skin of my roast chicken before I put the chicken in the oven. Usually olive oil first, then the paprika, then sprinkle it with some oregano.
7100 2018-07-07 22:50:04 Someone explain this to me, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was 8yrs ago yet Dawn is still using oily af animals to promote their soap???
7101 2018-07-07 22:49:43 Remove sanctions. Then RU can reignite their oil economy. Make a lot of cash, but a lot of military offense. Take over Baltics, as a start. What’s in it for the congressmen/woman? Check their links to oil. Or they need help in the next election.
7102 2018-07-07 22:49:42 Extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil on a cotton pad
7103 2018-07-07 22:49:42 That page says she has gone america because the waiting list is too long. That makes no sense, she had the oil in London.

7106 2018-07-07 22:49:09 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
7107 2018-07-07 22:48:56 Chi what do you think of Chris cooks comments regarding the USD and oil now being correlated?  Since April it sure seems like it but if it continues will devastate EM's if it hasn't already.
7108 2018-07-07 22:48:42 It shows that the small and corrupt volume of oil does not mix with honest and simple water. Leave them alone by themselves, and they will lose in their own game.
7109 2018-07-07 22:48:34 Totally, last windfall during 2003-2008 is a major evidence of China's oil demand as a key driver in boosting oil prices.

7116 2018-07-07 22:47:37 We have identical plays in Alberta, that are locally better than much of the Permian, Gainesville etc. & with the Canadian peso they would be wildly economic. They are not synthetic!!! Light oil!
But for bad governments’ regulations,taxation,royalties, they are “unreachable”
7117 2018-07-07 22:47:26 Seriously that was heart rending stuff.   It’s when you think about all of those “hairy *rsed oil rig workers“ in my world guys like that don’t cry.   It shouldn’t have happened #PiperAlpha

7125 2018-07-07 22:45:35 Seravalli has already reported oil shopping lucic & were willing to “sweeten the pot” in early June. 

If he’s concerned about the Lucic situation, I would think it’d be a valid concern.

7132 2018-07-07 22:44:19 One media says "ordered" and another says "asked"  and there is a big difference between the two  One will result in oil and the other a f**k off

7150 2018-07-07 22:41:49 I'm gonna put more CBD and less vape oil next time I fill it. Experiment a bit for best results. Got 2 different vape oils too. One with nicotine and one without (trying to cut back on the cigs a bit as well)
7151 2018-07-07 22:41:43 Yep, only advantage of using a high PUFA content oil is lower viscosity at lower temp.  Purely mechanical in effect, does not poison the insects.
7152 2018-07-07 22:41:15 Trump appeases PUTIN with every policy  . The tax plan lifted bans for oil drilling in Arctic , allowing PUTIN to proceed w his Fossil Fuel expansion agenda . Trade tariffs benefit PUTIN ECONOMY where sales of steel & aluminum will increase for Russia economy
7153 2018-07-07 22:41:02 The oil.  It’s all about the oil in the Artic.
7154 2018-07-07 22:40:47 They'll just complain about global warming once the buildings are, literally, under water! Then they'll sue the oil industry for their losses.

7158 2018-07-07 22:40:10 Wash ur leg, dry it, rub baby oil on it, shave how u regularly would, wash w soap and water again, dry, do the other leg, then do as u please babe I usually dry them off when I’m done and then run a lil bit of baby oil for the road Yanno?
7159 2018-07-07 22:39:57 You don’t see how our income taxes pay for it — it’s a big part of our military budget to protect our supply of oil for vehicles
7160 2018-07-07 22:39:56 IMO it is do to the fact they are lied to about the wars. I would be upset if I thought I was committing my life to a noble cause only to discover I am committing #CrimesAgainstHumanity for Dick Cheney's Genie Oil investments aka "US interests in the ME"
7161 2018-07-07 22:39:55 try coconut oil

7165 2018-07-07 22:39:22 He sale weed & do oil changes on the side.... but I guess I understand what she’s asking.... you wash ya hands b4 sex but not ya whole body(penis)... that is a lul odd
7166 2018-07-07 22:39:19 Keto makes you do weird things. Like drink olive oil and eat butter.
7167 2018-07-07 22:39:05 Have you researched how they get the palm oil for some vegan foods? No vegan can tell me what they are eating has done no harm to any animal unless they grow and harvest their own food. You don’t know how your food got to you, and what damage it could have caused.
7168 2018-07-07 22:39:04 Ah that sounds like my routine but I never have tried coconut oil before! Did you do the oil while your hair was still wet or wait for it to dry? 
7169 2018-07-07 22:38:47 @Valvoline Apopka, FL store incorrectly entered my Groupon & overcharged me for oil change. Manager wouldn't adjust. Had to call corporate for adjustment & they didn't offer anything other than adjustment. You lost two 25+ year customers today with your poor treatment & service.
7170 2018-07-07 22:38:33 You see I always just thought they were trying to reduce the population of Nigerians so there would be fewer resistance to the Islamisation but this makes a lot more sense. At least with the oil drinking cows they can be rich too
7171 2018-07-07 22:38:33 Now  Bella this is where I go off the range, if you want to tackle oil drilling deal with the source like Elon Musk at Tesla @elonmusk alternative energy anything else is histrionics. Make a change move like Elon or shut up! You are probably driving s petrol fueled car. Elon

7185 2018-07-07 22:36:42 I wouldn't dream of making a white sauce.  
Zucchini chopped, fried, garlic, olive oil; drop of water and cook to pulp. Finally melt Gorgonzola (pref aged) into it and then whip it around the boiled pasta. Plate.
7186 2018-07-07 22:36:34 That happened to me when I was 18 years old and instead of a concealed weapon I used a 5 qt pot of boiling oil. He quickly changed his mind.
7187 2018-07-07 22:36:09 Fries are naturally vegan. The oil is an additive.
7188 2018-07-07 22:36:08 Was it 3 oil masks/applications at once? 3 in a row in the same sitting? 3 in a week? i must know the secrets!
7189 2018-07-07 22:36:00 I've never been particular. Just regular old coconut oil. They have the same properties
7190 2018-07-07 22:36:00 It’s cause Twitter knows you’ve secretly been doing dabs even while you mock them, see, I can write oil and nothing happens, cause I haven’t. Only possible explanation.
7191 2018-07-07 22:35:51 We did have these things called treaties where we agreed that certain land would belong to a tribe for all time...or until gold, silver, copper, oil, natural gas or some other item that is worth money is found there. Then get off, it isn't your land anymore.
7192 2018-07-07 22:35:12 I used 9 shower products and coco butter with a pinch of coconut oil, don’t even look at me with ur nasty ass yellow smoker skin and eyes. 
7193 2018-07-07 22:34:57 I love a good romance/chick flick.  The evil witch ends up getting what they deserve and the prince and the princess and all the good animals in the kingdom, you know, as opposed to the filthy animals are happy that he is boiled in oil .

7200 2018-07-07 22:34:00 I would have preferred that, but I tried forms of CBD oil, which is probably what your friend uses, & it didn't work for me. I think I needed the THC! It's amazing. I know now why people want it legal.

7206 2018-07-07 22:32:54 The biggest impediment to nation-wide adoption of reverse osmosis water filters?

Filters.

Why?

It's a bitch to change filters.

Doesn't matter if it's oil filters, air filters, or water filters.

It's a pain in the ass to have to keep buying filters.

7208 2018-07-07 22:32:28 Sorry to hear of your frustration. You can pour off a little of the oil if you feel like its too much for your taste. You can also store upside down before you stir, that sometimes helps!

Now, if dinner could appear, and my laundry would be automatically done when I get home that would be great.
7212 2018-07-07 22:31:46 "substitute coconut oil in the same form at the same temperature for butter" mmhmm well they have different melting points so

7226 2018-07-07 22:27:21 I’m confused. Ur TPPF, Empower Texans & the TLR Rall funded primarily by those who hav benefited frm tax breaks & subsidizing in 1 form or another. Oil/gas gets all sorts of breaks; the TLR’s Big Insurance buds get protected guaranteed profit margins. U biting hand that feeds u?
7227 2018-07-07 22:27:01 No chance of settlement because of the ridiculous nature of the claim. Finger pointing back to oil company’s, are they also going to sue the fires which emit Co2? Or the camels that fart in Egypt? Lol... crazy lawyers. Oil company’s won’t settle for anything but a win.

7233 2018-07-07 22:25:35 No.  It's an emulsion of egg yolks, oil, & vinegar. Used as a dressing and condiment for salads and sandwiches. You may know it by the nickname "Mayo".

7237 2018-07-07 22:24:40 Right. Another BS Essential Oil “Cure” for migraines. I wish you people would stop pushing this crap off on sufferers who don’t know any better.  It’s certain to be a waste of money to any numbers above a placebo effect and another disappointment.
7238 2018-07-07 22:24:35 Dropping a hundred on supplements knowing I need an oil change...I wanna do better y’all.
7239 2018-07-07 22:24:17 Change your surroundings. Do something daring. Try something new. Drink more water. Use more coconut oil. Read more books. Learn a new hobby. Talk to yourself. MOTIVATE OTHERS.
7240 2018-07-07 22:24:12 I got new tires and an oil change today, washed my car and got a new air freshener so basically today I am a new person
7241 2018-07-07 22:23:55 Presumably until his skin is clear of the infection. He’s on antibiotics, so we just have to get rid of the oil and gunk on his skin so it heals up properly and doesn’t take hold again before finishing his meds.
7242 2018-07-07 22:23:51 I have been looking into CBD oil and want to buy some, especially for the cancer fighting properties. I have found many sites that offer a non-THC product. In your opinion, is it worth investing in?

7246 2018-07-07 22:23:07 That's why you need him! Just pass a regulation that oil spills will only be investigated if a properly filed complaint is submitted directly by affected wildlife in both English and French.
7247 2018-07-07 22:23:06 I should probably go get a oil change Monday.
7248 2018-07-07 22:23:01 Sadly there is zero need for low skilled workers in high tech mfg countries. Better would of been putting them in available areas rich in oil that can be turned into farm land . Over 1 billion sq miles are available in saudi oil fields.

7263 2018-07-07 22:20:43 Yeah no, pls show me a source. If we stopped using oil, gas, electricity, fuel, etc. all together, we would still exceed our carbon equvelant green house gass emissions of 565 GT by 2030 JUST from livestock alone. Animal ag accounts for more CO2 than all transportation combined.
7264 2018-07-07 22:20:39 Is it pure CBD or is it a blend of CBD and THC? CBD alone does nothing for me - I feel no physical effects. I use a 25:1 CBD/THC oil blend & it eradicates most of my neuropathy symptoms. Anything higher in the THC and it gives me a head change which I hate.

7299 2018-07-07 22:16:00 im so mad bc i dyed my hair pink so obviously i have to treat it. the lady who did my hair said to use coconut oil so i did. my mom says “oh i didn’t say anything but you shouldn’t have done that i knew if other ways” LIKE I PAYED 200$ OF MY MONEY AND NOW I THINK MY HAKRS RUINED
7300 2018-07-07 22:15:58 Corporations can spill poison they will get away but working class one spoon of motor oil end up in jail for years
7301 2018-07-07 22:15:37 ぎええ気づいたら指から血出てて困惑
7302 2018-07-07 22:15:35 Hahahahaha ni I was surprised ne ma 
7303 2018-07-07 22:15:35 It's always been about needing that oil reserve drilled.

Hillary sanctioned them, they cudnt let her win, they needed to blackmail a pawn to lift sanctions, get Rex in as Sec State & get the deal done. 

They need it to save their economy & keep oligarchs happy.
7304 2018-07-07 22:15:31 The tariffs are a tiny fraction of the economy. They're not going to touch the real money-makers in banking and pharma and oil.
7305 2018-07-07 22:15:20 Freud to draw the government The Big arrows Triangle numbers could use oil Oil and meaning of others is reality.
7306 2018-07-07 22:15:15 Girl I ran over something last nite and hit my oil Pan and now my car don't work smh 
7307 2018-07-07 22:15:04 Where I hear they have vast oil reserves.
7308 2018-07-07 22:14:53 Waterboarding? They be okay with hot oil, the rack, and a public flogging with a cat o’nine tails. I seriously worry for his safety the more Mueller case slides down the poop chute...
7309 2018-07-07 22:14:45 Cable of Putin to Kolinda: Congratulations. Stop. Great game. Stop. You were better. Stop. Gas. Stop. Oil. Stop. Agrokor. Stop.
7310 2018-07-07 22:14:41 BUT HAVE YOU RUBBED YOURSELF DOWN WITH COCONUT OIL AND PRAISED THE DEMIGOD OF THE ISLANDS AND SEAS
7311 2018-07-07 22:14:30 I’m just gonna tell all y’all right now: coconut oil potato chips are the only kind of chip I wanna eat for the rest of my existence @JacksonsHonest
7312 2018-07-07 22:14:06 My 2 weeks of holidays (I know, unheard of in retail!) start today. Day 1 starts with @beausallnatural Full Time IPA and Snake Oil IPA from @StalwartBrewing. Who knows where I go from there!
7313 2018-07-07 22:14:03 Fires. Hurricanes. We have to take climate change seriously. Let's get solar panels on every roof. Let's make way for renewables and stop subsidizing big oil.
7314 2018-07-07 22:13:37 The only reason I really even want a man is so I’ll have someone to rub my CBD oil on my back, knees, and hips. Because I’m 95.  any volunteers? Hahaha.
7315 2018-07-07 22:13:20 Additionally we are very good at finding / substuting resources. Rare earths just had a price collapse due to new deposit discoveries and increased efficiency and better alternatives have kept oil costs down, benefitting everyone.
7316 2018-07-07 22:13:09 I got to buy 4 new tires  and it’s time for a oil change man
7317 2018-07-07 22:13:04 im at my mom house for the weekend and i spilled coconut oil in the bathroom. i cleaned it up but i still called my mom to tell her and she said “Wait until i get home.” im 27 and that phrase gave me PTSD.  #GrowingUpBlack
7318 2018-07-07 22:12:58 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
7319 2018-07-07 22:12:29 Lmfao she wanted some bright pink one and everywhere I went it was either spicy, sweet or in soybean oil and it wasn’t right 
7320 2018-07-07 22:12:24 Well the talks were about "energy"?

Like a half trillion dollar deal with Ex-Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson to drill RU oil w/Rosneft?

The one they cant do now cuz sanctions? 

The same Rosneft that sold 19% of its stake to who? Quatar?

The same Quatar bailing out Kushner?
7321 2018-07-07 22:12:24 @jasonzweigwsj fun column today. A few more: airlines are up, oil is down, papers and pencils are stationary; when in doubt, shell it out; my sex life is like the stock market, standard and poor.
7322 2018-07-07 22:12:21 Dale gas oil
7323 2018-07-07 22:12:17 Get the fuck up and put all the stolen oil under his pillow.
7324 2018-07-07 22:12:06 Congrats "Oil Tot"! Sending you the best of hugs for our favorite British! You deserve all the happiness in the world.
7325 2018-07-07 22:12:05 Dick said, "Father, I am squeaking. It is time for you to oil my servo motors."
7326 2018-07-07 22:11:57 I can’t wait to put this peppermint oil in my hair 
7327 2018-07-07 22:11:57 I wonder if they fry Popeye's Chicken in Olive oil?
#unclejokes #dadjokes
7328 2018-07-07 22:11:55 Fact is, for years US was an oil importer because before recent tech dvpts the cost to reach US oil was too high, because "dry" or unreachable economically.
7329 2018-07-07 22:11:29 Good oil and 
7330 2018-07-07 22:11:23 Should I use an oil based cleanser or is that unnecessary since I don’t rly wear makeup
7331 2018-07-07 22:11:16 My first day trying my CBD oil during the day. Anxiety down. Pretty level emotionally. Which is bad.
7332 2018-07-07 22:11:13 Iran dropped the US dollar as oil buys. US is pissed as the dollar dropped. STOP trading with the US!
7333 2018-07-07 22:11:05 Sure is the biggest taxpayers drain of all ... through so many channels, not just $30million handouts but wrecking broadcasting, war, oil, fake news, phone-hacking. Costs us a fortune in producing misery alone
7334 2018-07-07 22:10:59 Mofo got olive oil on deck
7335 2018-07-07 22:10:39 There are many verses that speak of using “medical treatments” such as applying bandages (Isaiah 1:6), oil (James 5:14), oil and wine (Luke 10:34), leaves (Ezekiel 47:12), wine (1 Timothy 5:23), and salves, particularly the “balm of Gilead” (Jeremiah 8:22). 1 of 3
7336 2018-07-07 22:10:35 Any tips on how to get a double extra dark spray tan off been scrubbing my skin for a week and I still look like a tiger loaf, tried the baby oil took some off and used fakebake tan removal and body scrub some tips ASAP please since it’s shorts weather n I look like a tiger loafx

7340 2018-07-07 22:10:06 Just saw the aftermath of a car wrecking into an oil tank by the BP on Dual Highway. Please send your prayers to whoever was in the car and the rescue teams at the accident because the oil tank was leaking when I last saw it. 
7341 2018-07-07 22:10:03 Having eaten nothing all day but crisps and hummous, I just made giant croutons from stale baguette. Bread. Oil. Salt. Garlic.  MOAR.
7342 2018-07-07 22:09:57 Clearly you are incorrect. Even the oil funnel is in the same place. Also ESTUARIES do not naturally occur in landlocked areas you dweeb
7343 2018-07-07 22:09:56 It is tricky. I'm trying to get my head around it. What if you've always sucked up to the bully to be able to snatch lunch from other students and are only standing up to them because your college application lies have been exposed by someone and they're not supporting you?
7344 2018-07-07 22:09:55 “Niggas getting raped, you still getting oil base”
7345 2018-07-07 22:09:54 This is the ugliest Presidency ever, 
and President too. It's bad enough he openly pledges allegiance to foreign chaotic thuggery, but the moron scuttles long held relationships. Leaving a mess behind. 
Coal and oil do this on an extinction scale, ignoring cost and consequences.
7346 2018-07-07 22:09:42 Also adulting today and gettin my oil changed
7347 2018-07-07 22:09:25 It was also the first time i had fries with truffle oil and it tasted weird

7349 2018-07-07 22:08:54 A reader is looking for recommendations for a local oil boiler service engineer? Thanks
7350 2018-07-07 22:08:31 Great town!
7351 2018-07-07 22:08:09 That’s very true!
7352 2018-07-07 22:08:08 Baloney, on all counts. The effective tax rate for US business is much lower because they get so many breaks already. Denmark, Norway, etc are doing just fine. 
And every Congress and Admin, incl. Trump and current Republicans, are still giving subsidies to farms, big oil, etc.
7353 2018-07-07 22:08:00 Coconut oil ?

7356 2018-07-07 22:07:21 It would make sense that anybody who sells the US oil wouldn’t want the US to become independent or sell oil.
7357 2018-07-07 22:07:18 So can you tell me what's the power of 3 families? In near past and now present. Is it money, religious power, magic power, oil, guns?
7358 2018-07-07 22:07:14 wait coconut oil is bad? that’s all i use for cooking. and chase oil pulling works for you?

7367 2018-07-07 22:05:30 You know it’s too hot in your house when your whole pot of coconut oil has completely melted. 
7368 2018-07-07 22:05:07 Our problems more transportation than taxes or royalties. Pipelines. Back to bad planning by Alberta PC govts. So let's elect those same morons again. Their philosophy is to sell a dollar's worth of oil for 50 cents. Not very smart for most Albertans.
7369 2018-07-07 22:05:00 Shebi her oil sold out
7370 2018-07-07 22:04:45 Truly.  At this point you wonder how long and how deep the USA has been infiltrated while @GOP sold us for oil and greed~
7371 2018-07-07 22:04:33 Its a tragedy that the EPA is been systemically dismantled as a protector of the environment people animals health to a protector of the polluters Big Oil King Coal

7382 2018-07-07 22:02:21 It’s okay!! It look good either way and it can always grow back!! (Massage Castor oil for 15 minutes and then rinse it out for growth also kpak joico restorative serum has been nominated by allure for 3 years I think and it’s v good)
7383 2018-07-07 22:02:10 Magnesium oil is also good - for aches as well 
7384 2018-07-07 22:01:46 i've literally been getting sunburnt every time i go to the beach so i look down at my sunscreen and it's actually tanning oil....

7391 2018-07-07 22:00:53 Dispute you on the $100 oil, would take some major event to crimp supply. Perps in Bakken (ND) will freak more, ez profit. Now only TX frak oil is cheap enough to drill more.
7392 2018-07-07 22:00:50 Do y’all pronounce it oil or oil?
7393 2018-07-07 22:00:47 This problem was caused by Iran and Saudi Arabia with oil money. It’s very sad that the poor and weak are the ones that always suffer!
America should do more and so should the rich Arab neighbors around. Everyone please urge the World’s media to bring this to everyone’s conscious
7394 2018-07-07 22:00:40 They soft shell, pan seared 'em, little bit of panko, butter/oil salt and pepper.
7395 2018-07-07 22:00:30 Yes, we now are an exporter of oil and no longer dependent on imported oil. Just need a pipeline to California so we don't have the 2nd highest prices in the nation or maybe some electric car charging stations???
7396 2018-07-07 22:00:27 Sea of oil. I agree hamcat.
7397 2018-07-07 22:00:26 I know we have population problems down here in Puget Sound, I'd hate to see that happen elsewhere. I get that oil is a thing, I just wish we'd hurry up and push on something better already

7401 2018-07-07 21:59:38 Me: "Oh crap I didn't check these sweets for gelatine before I shoved them in my face. Okay no, I'm good."

Also me, eight hours ago: "Maybe if I buy some fish oil supplements that will help these intense cravings for fish which I have never eaten."

7410 2018-07-07 21:56:46 @realDonaldTrump Go back military exercise right way,oil embargo against North Korea,sanction any banks that deal with North Korea, and let North Korea that the military option is now on the table.

7419 2018-07-07 21:54:53 Totally agree, except the oil part
you are an engineer from a very good university with huge knowledge of solar energy, can this be the inspiration ;)
7420 2018-07-07 21:54:48 Ben why do you like big Oil?
7421 2018-07-07 21:54:05 CNN does have an audience.  Some times when I'm having my oil changed the TV in the waiting area will be set on CNN.  There's a lot of Jiffy Lubes!  Don't laugh!
7422 2018-07-07 21:53:56 Now dab on that Irania oil.

7426 2018-07-07 21:53:14 Float fest is only 2 weeks away. I haven’t even begun thinking about camping gear that I need, the money I need, gotta get my oil changed for this drive. Does anyone have a canopy I can borrow?
7427 2018-07-07 21:53:06 Live tweeting my oil getting changed
7428 2018-07-07 21:52:48 Looks like another great choice. Lol
7429 2018-07-07 21:51:47 Wait, but this is Day 4 of the #SecondCivilWar. I mowed the yard and trimmed the driveway edges. Thankfully encountered no Red Hats. Tomorrow I weed the garden and use Neem Oil to rid them of Trump Grasshoppers.
7430 2018-07-07 21:51:38 one more drunk man screams it’s coming home at me i’m throwing hot oil in their face
7431 2018-07-07 21:51:24 This bridge was part of my community. Damaged 25 Oct 1960 by 2 oil barges striking pier in fog, dislodging two spans and fracturing gas main. Huge fire. Train just missed the incident.  BR decided greater value in selling for scrap than mending for diverted Severn Tunnel traffic.
7432 2018-07-07 21:51:21 Alt. meds are a $30b industry in the US. FDA not allowed to require companies to prove efficacy.  Huge lobbying effort & massive support to politicians who bless unregulated snake oil. According to recent studies, >50% of their products do not even contain what's claimed.

7435 2018-07-07 21:51:09 What are we supposed to do when every single one of our moisturisers has melted into some sort of weird oil??
7436 2018-07-07 21:50:57 It took millions of years for the climate of the Holocene to stabilize – and the oil companies eviscerated it in a flash.

7440 2018-07-07 21:49:48 People still believe there’s oil money in alberta
7441 2018-07-07 21:49:30 I have a huhuge dry patch on my face and I’ve been putting oil on it but I literally have no idea what else to doooo
7442 2018-07-07 21:49:27 Non sequitur and ad hominem. Actually Canada's economy has been doing well, overall. Alberta has also been doing better of late. Trump's tariffs might put a wrench in that, especially cars and steel. Our problem is workers who only have skills to work in oil industry.
7443 2018-07-07 21:49:11 The revenue from oil pays for those social programs

7445 2018-07-07 21:49:02 The words "canvas" and "canvass" sound alike but have different meanings. "Canvas" refers to a closely woven cloth used for such things as tents, sails, and oil paintings. "Canvass" means to look over carefully or to solicit votes, orders, or opinions. You're welcome.
7446 2018-07-07 21:48:57 With some oil and polish, you can bring back tickets to its previous prestige and glamour. #BringBackTickets
7447 2018-07-07 21:48:57 80% of energy in a gas car goes out the tailpipe... so coal is still way way better than oil. SOLAR is the long term answer.
7448 2018-07-07 21:48:52 Got the oil changed still haven’t stopped to get food, now driving again still deciding what to get? Any recommendations? 

P.s. Michael doesn’t eat vegetables
7449 2018-07-07 21:48:29 “You should put oil on your cuticles”
“...Like... eat fried chicken with my hands???”
7450 2018-07-07 21:48:27 Except for in this term of NS govt., his politics was never anti establishment. And i believe all of us should not hate political parties because they are integral for a  strong democratic system.
7451 2018-07-07 21:48:24 Castor Oil Nasty ASFFF 
7452 2018-07-07 21:48:22 Guess I’ll go get me a oil change
7453 2018-07-07 21:48:08 The fact that this man has a national platform really shows the deep cultural cancer that permeates the country. He is a ‘performance clown’ and snake oil disinformation conman in it for the clicks and the big big $$$

The pain he inflicts on the culture is simply unbearable
7454 2018-07-07 21:47:55 Making Parmesan Crusted Chicken with roasted veggies. Baby reds,sweet poatoes,onions,garlic,carrots,zucchini,squash in olive oil.
7455 2018-07-07 21:47:38 that's your 'going to get my car's oil changed' outfit?  i don't think i could handle your 'going to pick up some chinese food' outfit
7456 2018-07-07 21:47:35 Here only CBD oil no thc is legal.
7457 2018-07-07 21:47:17 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
7458 2018-07-07 21:47:07 Some dude replied to a tweet with something about "quim oil" and I'm banning men forever for making me read that phrase.
7459 2018-07-07 21:46:55 i can't find my essential oil and im getting anxious :( help :(

7461 2018-07-07 21:46:40 I used too much olive oil in my hair now it look like I got a Jheri curl
7462 2018-07-07 21:46:35 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?

7464 2018-07-07 21:46:03 Got this new beard oil. It smells so so good

Apparently it’s supposed help patches and growth. Let’s see
7465 2018-07-07 21:45:49 This is literally the worst fucking feeling and why I started using CBD oil on my hair& skin. It stopped my hair from falling out in CLUMPS &kept my eyebrows/ lashes from shedding. I put some on a lash/brow brush and comb. I wasn't on the same kind of chemo, but it may help
7466 2018-07-07 21:45:39 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
7467 2018-07-07 21:45:29 Who suffers from anxiety? Chronic pain? Insomnia? Migraines? Etc.. I’ve discovered and used CBD oil which has drastically helped my anxiety & migraines. I can’t wait to start again once once i have the baby but if you’re interested in the products I’ve used DM me for info!
7468 2018-07-07 21:45:20 They still bled (?), Not bled, not bleeding. How can you bleed something that very clearly isn't blood. A viscous dark liquid, like oil but thicker, and more disgusting, conveniently.
7469 2018-07-07 21:45:13 I agree but at $300 as it would be all over and we would be living like Mad Max - funny with commodities greed blinds those specs that come in all those banker comments about 100/150 oil with those big green eyes have no link with the downside
7470 2018-07-07 21:45:09 If your man can’t change oil or change a tire is he really a man 
7471 2018-07-07 21:45:07 This is why I have a Nigerian oil minister on speed dial.
7472 2018-07-07 21:44:49 If the US had qualified they would have just invaded all the other countries for their own good, took their oil, antiques, fresh water and minerals for Apple products.
7473 2018-07-07 21:44:44 From time to time I always deep how chafia uses castor oil for her lashes like they’re eye drops ffs
7474 2018-07-07 21:44:39 yeah it will work, use water an oil and do it in small sections combing from the ends up to the root
7475 2018-07-07 21:44:35 It’s so hot in SoCal that my entire jar of coconut oil melted to liquid

7477 2018-07-07 21:44:23 SOS can someone check my oil and anti freeze 
7478 2018-07-07 21:44:23 are there oil pipelines going or plan to be going thru any of the states where these senators are from?  Could be a Russia connection.
7479 2018-07-07 21:44:18 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
7480 2018-07-07 21:44:11 Yes. That’s true to an extent. Tho oil was always a big issue for them on that attempt tho. That worked out very well for them. Economic nationalism leads to war while also failing to boost prosperity. Part of why it’s a terrible idea.
7481 2018-07-07 21:44:09 Bi oil
7482 2018-07-07 21:44:02 nagising ng maaga dahil nagulantang sa sobrang lakas ng buhos ng ulan ...babangon na at para maaga makapila...mitsubishi balintawak later para sa change oil...buti pa sasakyan ko mapa change oil ulit...ako kaya hahahaha...
7483 2018-07-07 21:43:55 May salary adjustment din naman ang employees ng Meralco at sa mga oil companies kaya let's expect na babawiin din nila yun sa mga products at services nila. Same with workers sa mga manufacturing ng goods and basic commodities.
7484 2018-07-07 21:43:54 Agree as more solar comes online less need for coal and oil..
7485 2018-07-07 21:43:50 Moriel: *the Maia was more than greatful, very much wishing to wash away the oil, preferably as soon as possible* Thank you so much. I won't be long. *now the tricky part would be keeping Mairon in the dark about the whole thing* @Silvian_
7486 2018-07-07 21:43:47 Also carry a ramp.  Like the $20 red oil change ones.  Flat trailer tire on tandem axle?  Whip out the ramp and pull trailer’s good tire up on it and the flat will dangle there to change.
7487 2018-07-07 21:43:15 With Brexit you’ll get your independence.

England without Scotland, Wales, NI & Gib.

England without a world finance hub, without oil revenue, without a car or aerospace industry..

The only things you’ll get to keep are Austerity and xenophobia.
7488 2018-07-07 21:42:44 Oil companies have been advised to put their shareholders before the environment and the future of our species! 
Seems silly, but that fossil fuel for you!
Dollar is now fixed to Brent, so US will do anything to force price!
This is the end game!
7489 2018-07-07 21:42:39 Gracias. Although, World Cup and betting is like oil and water. 
7490 2018-07-07 21:42:38 There is nothing that makes me feel clean like peppermint, I especially love peppermint oil in my hair 
7491 2018-07-07 21:42:37 my skin is so clear and soft right now all thanks to coconut oil & water
7492 2018-07-07 21:42:37 We don't have a new cabinet yet. But when we do, I'm fairly sure it won't be long before some bits of silver land in it. If not, I'm happy just to watch very good football. If it was all about trophies we'd all support whoever the oil industry supports. Fuck that.
7493 2018-07-07 21:42:23 And you are just FINE with drilling for oil off the Florida coastline. Be sure to include that,
7494 2018-07-07 21:42:01 Medium to full. Works much better than any high end I’ve had.  I prime with a rosehip oil or just moisturizer and I’m good to go.
7495 2018-07-07 21:41:54 I could get oil and it has no thc. then I have no interest.
7496 2018-07-07 21:41:53 Agree #coherence is paramount! #purposewashing is serious even if there is not an oil spill. Would be good to know more about actions.
7497 2018-07-07 21:41:39 You argument makes no sense. Do you have any idea how much funding and money a scientist could make from coal and oil companies if they could prove global warming is a scam?
7498 2018-07-07 21:41:33 Just one drop of the glistening oil can eventually stain even a soul as stalwart as a loxodon's beyond redemption.　《Loxodon Convert》[NPH]
7499 2018-07-07 21:41:17 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

7503 2018-07-07 21:40:35 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
7504 2018-07-07 21:40:35 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7511 2018-07-07 21:40:07 A Croatian joke from my mate: "I just heard that our President got a cable from Putin. It said: Congratulations. Stop. Awesome game. Stop. You were really better. Stop. Natural gas. Stop. Oil. Stop. Agrokor. Stop."

7513 2018-07-07 21:40:06 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since March? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!
7514 2018-07-07 21:40:03 Last week I read many ways to have lower oil prices, will they be true? I do not know, but I wonder, would not it be easier for Iran to accept US conditions? Maybe the president should think a little more about his people and not about nuclear weapons. #OOTT #nomorehighoilprice
7515 2018-07-07 21:39:53 is ranch dressing an essential oil

7520 2018-07-07 21:39:08 Surely not for the Carbon Dioxide in the air that had been there before and during millions of years have slowly been soaked up by plants that died and formed oil.  Offcourse burning this oil and putting this CO2 back in the atmosfere in a few decades couldn’t make a difference!
7521 2018-07-07 21:39:05 More of a practical move by oil companies.
They have they money, retail locations and facilities to produce, transport, store & sell liquids & gasses already...whats one more?
As opposed to the calculated 4 trillion to add enough charging stations to the world?

7528 2018-07-07 21:37:40 For soup, cook minced garlic in oil, then simmer with lamb, cumin, coconut milk and celery. Top with chopped peanuts.
7529 2018-07-07 21:37:40 Sure beats working on that North Sea oil rig.
7530 2018-07-07 21:37:31 Aesee hee star feminist @oil_is_opium bhi hein. Not the same argument but Blocked me for saying that let everyone have their own opinion about Ali Zafar and don’t impose yours.

7534 2018-07-07 21:37:13 No,better asking WM why Scotland aren't allowed corporation/oil revenue tax,let's leave the working man alone,isn't tory austerity enough to cope with?
7535 2018-07-07 21:37:01 Put olive oil on them with salt and pepper then pop them in the oven. They’re good like that.
7536 2018-07-07 21:36:42 Also fries are vegan if made with vegetable oil, and that’s the hangover cure nr. 2, right?? (Nr. 1 is not drinking at all)
7537 2018-07-07 21:36:40 Thanks you sir. No one nation is has two Reno Omokris, You are another resource, a crude oil Nigeria is blessed with.
7538 2018-07-07 21:36:37 What are you afraid of, Davie? How much is caging children & DNA testing them costing us, & how much will it cost us in lawsuits? How much are you being paid, by failing oil & coal corporations, to dismantle sustainable & clean energy regulation? Crooked Davie.
7539 2018-07-07 21:36:33 Because the eggs and the oil become consubstantial?
7540 2018-07-07 21:36:29 Literally..I do not care if oil goes to $30 or $300 trading wise..as a trader, I can make $ upside or downside ..Macro wise EM economies are so fragile now...oil won't see triple digits ..if it does..it will surely send the global markets into a place you do not want to see

7543 2018-07-07 21:36:11 The Trump administration allowed American oil moguls to intentionally create an oil shortage to jack up prices, eroding the tax cuts and disposable income.
7544 2018-07-07 21:35:59 people that don't wear suncream / lather themselves in baby oil because they think it helps them tan better are foooools cant wait to see that rawww pasty skin when your burn peels off hun lololol xoxo
7545 2018-07-07 21:35:52 Your'e shifting the discussion. We aren't talking about oil or the environment right now. We are talking about the human rights violations that the Saudi Arabian Regime commits.
7546 2018-07-07 21:35:37 I watching an Interview with #SebastianStan #AnthonyMackie and Winston Duke and Sebastian said that Bucky Washes his Hair with Coconut Oil From Wakanda 
7547 2018-07-07 21:35:32 A freshening facial mask, sultry yellow, with carrot, rosewood oil, and exfoliating brown sugar. It's sold as a chunk wrapped in paper.
7548 2018-07-07 21:35:23 Of course you know as a well educated businessman that prices are determined by supply/demand.  Blocking Iran from selling oil decreases supply - and raises cost.  Blocking solar and wind energy increases oil demand - and raises cost.  So Trump policies are increasing cost?
7549 2018-07-07 21:34:58 Southwest Key opened its doors in 1987, it didn't  just pop up since Trump was elected, they've been housing illegal immigrant children for years.  Owned by Dr. Juan Sanchez, former director/board member of La Raza (now UnidosUS a new neutral facade. lol)
7550 2018-07-07 21:34:54 So great!!
7551 2018-07-07 21:34:25 I was referring toxic waste not oil.

7553 2018-07-07 21:34:11 So long as you are not there to greet it, you wanton chancher, real football fans will be able to celebrate, Bullingdon snake oil seller.
7554 2018-07-07 21:33:54 I'm very patient... but can Alberta be? in a year when output was up and prices unexpectedly high the gov't ran an $8B deficit. 

with oil prices likely to drop in the long term, pipelines delayed or killed off, how will AB pay the bills? GDP is only part of the story, agree?
7555 2018-07-07 21:33:49 I'm very much aware what he was discussing.  It was a snarky comment because he was insulting a great country. Oil is actually Colombia's #1 export btw. I'm from the United States but thanks for thinking I was from Colombia! What a compliment.
7556 2018-07-07 21:33:35 The same ppl that are racist and hate brown folks? 
That's really dumb statement
7557 2018-07-07 21:33:29 Doing a garage sale and some guy just asked if he could buy me and then offered to pay me to help clean his semi truck and change the oil and stuff
7558 2018-07-07 21:33:27 Some questions though, comparing simple flour and cooking oil with meat is treasonous
7559 2018-07-07 21:33:15 Rub baby oil on your fingers and massage your lashes... that will loosen them up. But I didn’t like them either 
7560 2018-07-07 21:33:03 It bothers me when a US president disrespects... Everything. Treaties, G7, trade, and most importantly env/climate change issues where he's willing to make a mockery of his own EPA by selecting coal+oil lobbyists to run the thing. This guy is destructive and deserves no respect.
7561 2018-07-07 21:33:02 I prefer the oil to the fish, any problem ?

7577 2018-07-07 21:31:01 Reading the sub-headline, we're already facing rising costs--a previously two or three dollar bottle of sesame oil blend is five dollars, and tofu, poor food, is no longer available under 99 cents a block anywhere. Of course, they like keeping AAs from our foods.
7578 2018-07-07 21:30:49 [10:22PM] @yippykayyee: No near there o! Was on Awolowo for over an hour... Forte Oil to the roundabout pere ??? #TrafficChief
7579 2018-07-07 21:30:48 It's not about US oil, but financially rigged sell-side prices supporting Brent for >15 yrs to extract XS profit. China now has 1/Deliverable buy-side benchmark; 2/ >700m bbl oil war chest stashed; 3/ Asia Buyers club coming. We will soon see market power has shifted to buy-side
7580 2018-07-07 21:30:35 I have begun experimenting with Beard Oil. Look out world, here I come?
7581 2018-07-07 21:30:35 There's an oil for that 
7582 2018-07-07 21:30:25 Thanks for the reply, I’ll give that a shot. Will olive oil work or just canola? Love your guys’ filament, looking forward to getting this working :)
7583 2018-07-07 21:30:16 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
7584 2018-07-07 21:30:13 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since March? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!

7587 2018-07-07 21:30:03 lucas oil series at woodburn dragstrip next weekend hope to see everyone there
7588 2018-07-07 21:29:42 I am a huge critic of the parties n wish them dead; it hurts me to stand up for Maryam because corruption, but we have to see thru politics
7589 2018-07-07 21:29:34 Dreadful plug for MCT-Oil though, and the example meals make it much too complicated. Steak and eggs works best, supplementing with veggies is also ok, lots of butter and oil on top - doubtful.
7590 2018-07-07 21:29:30 us as much water, conditioner and oil as possible on your roots
7591 2018-07-07 21:29:21 Looks like someone selling epilepsy snake oil to me...
7592 2018-07-07 21:28:56 Could someone please invent instandry for oil and acrylic paints. 
Please!
7593 2018-07-07 21:28:53 An oil company with an army would be anarcho-cspitslism. I'd be OK with that so long as they didn't make me pay for it (taxation).
7594 2018-07-07 21:28:53 I am not at all convinced that "most modern diseases are really just symptoms of the same problem" and I suspect anyone saying that is selling snake oil.
7595 2018-07-07 21:28:49 Nixon was bad—ultimately the Southern Strategy gave us Trump, no argument.

But GWB doubled-down on the whole oil thing, just as climate change was becoming inarguable and tech alternatives were becoming viable. Potentially blew trillions on the Iraq fiasco. Right before 2007/08.
7596 2018-07-07 21:28:48 Sardine Oil >>> the fish
7597 2018-07-07 21:28:45 You should never wear belts with suspenders.

7598 2018-07-07 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
7599 2018-07-07 21:28:22 that’s exactly why it gets tricky. Suppose you stand up to a huge bully but they get/discredit you coz you lied on your college app.
7600 2018-07-07 21:28:11 Damn, oil reserves
7601 2018-07-07 21:27:57 The idea is that purple (Touch O. S.) takes out the brassy tones - if you like the red, don't. I always went for The Monroe so I did not like Brass.

If your hair is dry, I recommend shit tons of coconut oil. Like metric shittons of coconut.wash it less often, oil it, mask it,
7602 2018-07-07 21:27:47 Corporation tax/north sea oil tax receipts,well,that's a differant story.
7603 2018-07-07 21:27:38 Modern day thermometer is having your coconut oil turn into liquid
7604 2018-07-07 21:27:35 Great cast who were able to show that underneath all the disfunction, schemes & lies was a family who loved each other. And oil, they loved oil too... 
7605 2018-07-07 21:27:33 Back from the mountains. Time to grill some yardbird on the Egg. Olive oil and three different @PERFECTBITEBBQ seasonings. Chicken rub, Twisted Dixie rub, and Cajun Q rub. Pics to follow!
7606 2018-07-07 21:27:10 That is stunning! Looks like an oil painting.
7607 2018-07-07 21:27:05 For some reason I thought putting baby oil on me then sitting at the beach was a good idea... #lobster
7608 2018-07-07 21:27:03 Sarah Sanders says Canada has taken advantage of America. We ship more oil to US than any other country. We paid Michigan to take our surplus hydro. And who the fuck wants your dairy products that are full of growth hormones. Feed the milk to Trump it may enlarge his brain.

7611 2018-07-07 21:25:10 < can agree on this. Without applying either/or approach, it is not justified to absolve or even glorify one criminal because there's one bigger criminal in our political scenario.
7612 2018-07-07 21:25:08 Hey Chris so let me see....to be honest I don’t really know why the garlic bread is considered Italian. At maximum we have bruschetta with olive oil and garlic but we eat it not like we eat garlic bread here! ...
7613 2018-07-07 21:24:52 I’m gonna marry someone in the oil field 
7614 2018-07-07 21:24:51 If this didn't have such dark impacts on our nation. Most times this level of hypocrisy would simply be laughable.
Not forgetting tRump and facts work as well as oil and water.
7615 2018-07-07 21:24:51 Weirdness. Feel your pain. Water, baby oil, dry, apply scientific chemical might help...
7616 2018-07-07 21:24:35 my skin looks so ugly im so damn ashy but my face is dripping from oil 
7617 2018-07-07 21:24:04 Yeah lol Azerbaijan in the Olympics is basically anybody they throw oil money at
7618 2018-07-07 21:23:46 I'm allergic to life!!! I use baby oil after showering as a moisturizer. Insects all over the world want to eat me. Cold showers, 100% cotton, calamine, ice packs, anti itch cream, white toothpaste, etc etc antihistamine in all it's forms. If skin had a simple answer to its
7619 2018-07-07 21:23:45 Asi y todo es mas barata que en uruguay jajajajajaja y ahora les llega ute con aumento y 26 de julio pin para arriba en el gas oil
7620 2018-07-07 21:23:41 Having hurt feelings because something is rude is much better than selling snake oil to the vulnerable resulting in worsening sickness or even death.
7621 2018-07-07 21:23:40 Eat more fat. Then what you want to do is eat more fat. Cook everything in butter or oil, eat macadamia nuts. Also the diet can make you shed water so you can be dehydrated OR your salt intake is too low.
7622 2018-07-07 21:23:24 @reno
Pls save us in Nigeria non oil export sector, previous government awarded d contract to us but we started under dis administration, the minister of finance has refused to sign our invoices, we are owed almost 20 months salaries pls do something pls. When u talk pple listen
7623 2018-07-07 21:23:20 Home girl had me try cinnamon milk with a few drops of cannibas oil. Its not bad
7624 2018-07-07 21:23:12 And electric cars should recharge themselves or run off water fuck the oil cost and damage on the impact of the world, we will not be able to live if we stay with the current forms of transportation we need a ban on gasoline cars with a government care package to help
7625 2018-07-07 21:22:59 No near there o! Was on Awolowo for over an hour... Forte Oil to the roundabout pere

7629 2018-07-07 21:22:39 try olive oil. it might lift it out.
7630 2018-07-07 21:22:36 Rice bran oil is too processed imho for regular use. Most vegetable oils are . Unrefined EVOO, coconut oil, and a couple others are ok. Most vegetable oils are heavily processed with chemicals and are basically industrial waste.

7632 2018-07-07 21:22:09 All self delusion if you think those tests “go further”. They only go further in emptying people’s wallets into “NDs” pockets. Snake oil is still snake oil no matter how you package it.
7633 2018-07-07 21:21:46 IMO Roe will not stand and cannot be constitutional once the unborn attain personhood under Fed Law.
Dred Scott could not stand after emancipation and passage of 14th amendment when blacks attained full personhood. 
Leftists fear this and deny science here.
7634 2018-07-07 21:21:46 Should fit right in with the other grifting, ethically vacuous, lieing, snake oil salesman GOP criminals !
7635 2018-07-07 21:21:37 So confusingly all religious warfare Christians do against Satan is inside his Egyptian white magic unless it’s the wine and oil of Christ, the cup of the new covenant! 
7636 2018-07-07 21:21:36 Try reading a book called "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair? You may get a sense of what industry does without government regulations. 

Food safety
Drug safety
Asbestos
Oil leaks
Sewage leakage
Agricultural run-off
Well water contamination

Etc.

Do you live in a ping pong ball?
7637 2018-07-07 21:21:33 Also heating, cooling, cooking, manufacturing, and the gajillion things made out of oil (like all plastic, fertilizer, etc)
7638 2018-07-07 21:21:14 They both love oil and coal and hate Obama's protectionist regulations. No difference...

7640 2018-07-07 21:20:58 she's great at what she does, selling snake oil.
7641 2018-07-07 21:20:13 Ridiculous. Insurance does not pay for unproven remedies. State doesnt care what you take but does prosecute if someone markets snake oil as a cure for cancer etc.
7642 2018-07-07 21:20:06 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since March? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!

If in previous 5 years, only discrete funds were used honestly, Kohat would have been a better place, yet leave alone the royalty of Oil & gas of Kohat. Law minster hatched his eggs 7 begone, never listened him

7645 2018-07-07 21:19:50 Trump does Mueller have you connected to those foreign banks and money laundering?
Too bad you couldn't get to the Russian/Exxon oil. Or did u? I don't know. We're u going to get a cut? And you still haven't enforced Congress approved sanctions.

7649 2018-07-07 21:19:09 It is not strange from a country who helped destroying neighborhood country and stole their factories and oil and also is the pathway for isis to Syrian lands to do such a report as Egypt destroyed their dream to role the Middle East area .. #erdogan_oil_thief

7651 2018-07-07 21:18:59 Here’s a tip for the summer:
Chlorine can dry your hair out, after you get out of the pool put some coconut oil in. I have oily hair but after getting out of the pool my hair feels super dry. This is what worked for me!
7652 2018-07-07 21:18:43 Girls be all into cars but can’t even change their own oil. Come on now.
7653 2018-07-07 21:18:38 I miss my childhood days. My mom would force me to sit with her & oil my hair & massage my head & I would tell her about my day, but now, we barely converse, & even if we do converse, it ends up in a fight & i hate it.
*Sigh* I never thought life would turn like this.
7654 2018-07-07 21:18:34 I hope Canadians can see that Trudeau is a snake oil salesman
7655 2018-07-07 21:18:34 Jiffy lube didn’t even tell me the other fluids i need changed in my car. Just gave me the oil change. Precision was like where u been goin? Lol
7656 2018-07-07 21:18:33 What a great election win - where’s your map again?
Sanctions aren’t necessary. 
You have great taste in women. 
Nerve agents are fake news
Want to borrow some hookers?
Increase oil prices
Have you lost weight again?
Shut down NATO
7657 2018-07-07 21:18:28 why "inflatable" for some parts you can also use metal transport-tubes from the oil industry.. easy to cut to size and weld or bold together
7658 2018-07-07 21:18:11 
7659 2018-07-07 21:17:58 Jiffy Lube, idk what kind of oil I have.. just give me the cheapest shit you got.
7660 2018-07-07 21:17:35 Trump made sure oil price went up to fill Russian coffers. Now we pay 1.00 more a gallon. And the idiots who voted for Trump can’t seem to add together 1+1=2
7661 2018-07-07 21:17:23 Incredible biodiversity. I can’t believe Virunga has been opened to oil drilling. Did you see much devastation from mining? I’ll have to read through more of your blog 
7662 2018-07-07 21:17:11 Hahaha touché touché. I just think a lot of it is a crock of shit. People think there’s an oil for everything imaginable. I will agree some have legitimate uses, but I’d take modern medicine for my problems over some extremely concentrated chemical mélange.
7663 2018-07-07 21:17:04 Been in the studio for 4 hours have managed to make nothing but I’ve smoked 2 grams of oil 
7664 2018-07-07 21:17:00 I caved and bought cbd oil to see if it helps with my anxiety...the guy at the shop could tell I have Issues lmao
I’m that easy to read?!? Weeps
I got anxiety just asking if they’re had it though so 
7665 2018-07-07 21:16:49 Yes put a bit of olive oil on the dough so it doesn't stick to the grill, also the charcoals should be on mid heat not high, and close the lid
7666 2018-07-07 21:16:26 I have done my outdoor adulting for today, so I hereby absolve myself of pants.

Battle with Mothra’s Closet remains, but I have a vacuum, lavender oil and pheromone traps for armour.
7667 2018-07-07 21:16:16 That’s easy let’s drop all ties to America like Cuba we will survive with an embargo. Who the hell needs that amount of racism. Tell air head Saunders we export more oil to America than any other country and we have sent a surplus of electricity and actually paid Michigan 2 tk it
7668 2018-07-07 21:15:56 Clinton Gave tanker after tanker of fuel oil. We received nothing in return. Do these people live under a rock?
7669 2018-07-07 21:15:52 The person that just applied that oil to your body is lucky! 
7670 2018-07-07 21:15:44 I use coconut oil a lot. Its helped grow out my hair.
7671 2018-07-07 21:15:28 Oh man this is like looking at wrapped up presents and wondering whats inside

Hey lets make a sativa strain for you. Your strain, you name it. You write music, I own a legal cannabis farm. I make the oil and vape and fuck around with genetics. Fun shit. Lets roll
7672 2018-07-07 21:15:19 Easiest way to ensure it stays in good condition is to put the cake in the freezer for a few hours then cover it in tin foil once out of the freezer. Spray the tin foil with olive oil so heat is kept at bay. Hope this helps.
7673 2018-07-07 21:15:10 Supporting what is virtually a one party system to achieve your independence borders on totalitarianism! Scotland has neither the economic power, nor the ability to stand on its own feet, even considering "your" oil! It will always need help from others!
7674 2018-07-07 21:14:52 Which line? I’ve been using the coconut oil and hibiscus one but I’m looking at the 100% coconut oil one.
7675 2018-07-07 21:14:34 Clearly iron age beasts you can tell by the rust and the chains
and by the oil that they bleed the crew and crows fly the skulls and bones
7676 2018-07-07 21:14:28 Where's Croatia get oil from now?
7677 2018-07-07 21:14:27 @IanKarmel, as usual, pulling out TRUTHS on @AllFantasyPod. Nutritional Yeast on popcorn is clutch. 
Throw in some salt, pepper, dill, olive oil, and onion/garlic powder to make a killllller popcorn seasoning!
7678 2018-07-07 21:14:18 Sudden oil shortage.
7679 2018-07-07 21:14:10 They wanted oil pipeline going through Syria to Europe but failed. They then resorted to arming rebels and terrorists to turn Syria into another Libya.  Look what is happening in Libya, it is ridden by slave-selling jihadists and no oil is sold legally.
7680 2018-07-07 21:14:09 By all means, continue explaining oil markets to me.

7682 2018-07-07 21:13:33 WTI OIL next week
7683 2018-07-07 21:13:24 Impressions of Norway - a country that works well and is consciously modern. Virtually cashless, going all electric, clean, well organised, and good public services. The odd spot of poverty or homelessness. Didn't waste their oil income as the UK did. Shame about the winters.
7684 2018-07-07 21:13:02 Yeah but still working our ashes off in nasty ass oil moving heavy ass equipment!
7685 2018-07-07 21:13:00 They were delicious but the chili oil wasn't spicy enough. :-/
7686 2018-07-07 21:13:00 Fracking techniques developed right here in the Lone Star State have unlocked an unimaginable wealth of oil and natural gas, turning the U.S. from an energy importer into a muscular exporter!
7687 2018-07-07 21:12:39 Oh BS. Sanctions will lifted, OPEC excoriated by Supreme Leader, who is meeting with Putin...  It’s all about OIL.
7688 2018-07-07 21:12:36 Stuff happening in the 70s was right out of national control - Oil and OPEC in particular.
7689 2018-07-07 21:12:27 When the mechanic curved a lady so you can get your oil changed first >  he said “there’s a wait”
7690 2018-07-07 21:12:04 Try making an aquamarine tachism work with sesame oil!
7691 2018-07-07 21:11:45 It is sickening when people, especially Africans support the USA whenever they bomb countries into poverty, and arm rebels and terrorists to stage regime change for oil and ensuring loyalty to the west.

7695 2018-07-07 21:11:16 This probably means our oil/ gas connection is gone, if anyone wants to support Croatian heating and transportation we would really appreciate it #RUSCRO
7696 2018-07-07 21:11:13 Seconding the baby food--sardines (the oil as well flakes of the fish) and high-calorie gel have also helped when ours have had appetite / low weight issues in the past
7697 2018-07-07 21:11:07 Trying out the oil I got as part of my medical marijuana prescription.
7698 2018-07-07 21:10:46 Pretty sure clean water & clean air have a lot to do with climate change, fracking, fossil fuel emissions, oil pipelines & coal that contaminate local water supplies, CO2 levels, toxic waste. It’s all connected, do u need a diagram brainy? As in basic learning comprehension.

7700 2018-07-07 21:10:19 Yes- I use CBD and Turmeric oil for chronic auto immune (RA) related pain and swelling. I have virtually no symptoms and off all RX meds.
7701 2018-07-07 21:10:10 Ooo once saw this dog at Janblo 3rd gate,I even snapped it in my former phone
7702 2018-07-07 21:10:10 I need to go to the rich to get my oil changed  but I’m so tired  can’t get shit done off These bananas

7704 2018-07-07 21:09:51 I am  DICTATOR Trump launches tradewar and dictates 0 Iranian oil to be bought . is strongly for Iran deal. Trump keeps making demands, but offers nth in return apart from american market size. Trump acts overly greedy, without sense of win-win. WILL WE FOLD? I HOPE NOT
7705 2018-07-07 21:09:31 i will but it wouldnt be oil i rub on her
7706 2018-07-07 21:09:16 Lol it won't be nice when you're forced to drink castor oil.
7707 2018-07-07 21:09:11 Absolutely! China controls NK. Watch and see oil start flowing back into NK from China. Kim is a puppet.
7708 2018-07-07 21:09:11 4 year program sounds like it is more like a bachelor degree majoring in marketing snake oil.
7709 2018-07-07 21:09:01 I really hate putting on lotion I prefer coconut oil
7710 2018-07-07 21:08:51 Oil and cold wax workshop. First to second layer. More to go...
7711 2018-07-07 21:08:42 U kno it's hot when your coconut oil is soup 
7712 2018-07-07 21:08:41 It is really sickening to see people, especially Africans supporting countries like USA who will bomb any country into a shithole for oil in the guise of regime change.
7713 2018-07-07 21:08:35 Idiots. Reactionaries. In Florida, the feds took over Lake Okeechobee. They’ve turned the 2 rivers they hooked into it to toxic poisonous killers & are ruining our pristine beaches & tourism. This was done years ago & Trump is working to fix it.
7714 2018-07-07 21:08:35 For people with acne: DO NOT use random shit shown in commercials and ads and similar stuff, as they do rely in chemicals which are too harsh on your skin; that precisely will trigger more oil production on your skin, and give you way more pimples and shit
7715 2018-07-07 21:08:28 Where is our alawee
7716 2018-07-07 21:08:25 @CanadianTire how is it that after an oil change my car now has inspection warning lights going off?how can no one there know what is wrong or how to fix it? Why was my tripometer reset? Why was my radio station changed? Why TF were my keys left in it sitting in the parking lot??
7717 2018-07-07 21:07:52 Imagine being too dense to understand an article and then tweeting about it.
7718 2018-07-07 21:07:04 Not only do I know how to Check my Oil, and Change a Tire. But now I know how to Change my Headlights!

7719 2018-07-07 21:07:04 All im saying is wheres funding to make these plastics common,commercialy seaweed and hemp can fit the bill,millions on gm research, token spending on cellulose is one if the most organic compounds on planet(it can replace oil)...where is the huge push(billions) in development
7720 2018-07-07 21:06:56 The oil's origin is the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. BOTAS, the state-owned oil company of Turkey owns that port and is a beneficiary of the export revenue.
7721 2018-07-07 21:06:47 Fry it with palm oil
7722 2018-07-07 21:06:36 If your mum never gave you Olive oil to drink, then she's not an African woman. 
7723 2018-07-07 21:06:33 Which part(s) are you disagreeing with? That we've started wars for oil, that it's fucked up to just dump it on the ground, or both?
7724 2018-07-07 21:06:30 How much did you pay though? That's just a bad apple, not regular maintenance like oil changes and brakes and on and on.

Added tbsp coconut oil, cinnamin, and tumeric to my preworkout coffee today, fasted(coconut oil allows you to stay in state of autophogy).  Had awesome pump and more energy than usual.

Will try this for a week.  Thoughts?

7728 2018-07-07 21:05:24 Here's a combination idea: Strawberry Dark Balsamic Vinegar and Basil Infused Olive Oil! Herby and fruity all at the same time. Highly recommended salad: spinach, walnuts, and feta. #salad #dressing #saladdressing #combo #chefmichelle
7729 2018-07-07 21:05:19 Sure oil is still in demand. The less costly is in greater demand. Basic economics. We are hampered by interprovincial spats. US has more delivery options. Bad planning by past Alberta govts. Should have gotten on pipelines much earlier.

7733 2018-07-07 21:04:22 i was tryna put the oil away and i find i incorporate gneiss and coal and long-threaded moss and fruits and grains and esculent roots
7734 2018-07-07 21:04:08 only after extra oil.
7735 2018-07-07 21:04:07 Have been on a #BiggBossTamil cleanse for 2 days. Finally caught up on Friday’s show. Janani = Paratta is hence proved. All she does is pour more oil into burning flames. #Biggbosstamil2 #Biggbosstamil2 @vijaytelevision
7736 2018-07-07 21:03:54 @cenkuygur any idea on the odds of Russia cutting Croatia's oil or natural gas this winter? Putin's PIIIIIIIIISED.  #RUSCRO
7737 2018-07-07 21:03:51 why do I feel like tea tree oil will fix all my problems
7738 2018-07-07 21:03:42 Oil change, gas and clean car make me happy 
7739 2018-07-07 21:03:36 As long as Flo doesn't use motor oil to cook it in, she can keep the secret. ;)
7740 2018-07-07 21:03:31 Literally: to sell oil
7741 2018-07-07 21:03:28 I did actually order CBD oil the other day for my anxiety and I’m lowkey hoping it’ll help with my migraines too
7742 2018-07-07 21:03:12 We must force the industries to find alternativs to vegetable oil, to stop the production of any vegetable oil.
7743 2018-07-07 21:03:09 I accept your opinion but it’s also my duty to remind you that one can’t be neutral on a moving train (Zinn); one has to know hegemony.
7744 2018-07-07 21:03:02 Tramadol also super addictive.. Try cbd oil, edibles... Sucks not covered by insurance but no tch, legal all 50 states, order online...
7745 2018-07-07 21:02:33 Apple cider vinegar diluted with water and use as you would a toner, an aloe Vera facial and leave it on until it's no longer wet, and then vitamin e oil overnight. Completely changed my skin
7746 2018-07-07 21:02:22 Chris so you think the Chinese might stop buying usa oil as a trade retaliation? Or even possibly just cut purchases substantially. What did you mean when you said "there is going to be some buy side action in 6 months to a year" thanks.
7747 2018-07-07 21:02:16 Exactly true, Saudi is happy to increase oil production but they want to make sure they dont increase production until factories ask them so oil prices stay the same. If they raise while Iran still sell, the prices will go down.

7750 2018-07-07 21:01:36 Some species are protected before life begins. example birds.
And its illegal to kill protected rocks. Stalactites/stalagmites. Yes its true. According to environmentalists, oil from your hands kills further growth and it takes centuries for the rock to die.

7752 2018-07-07 21:01:29 Lol yeah i think oil is useless for them xD
7753 2018-07-07 21:01:28 why is my skin so greasy it feels like i took a bath in oil
7754 2018-07-07 21:01:28 I'll look into that. I dated a few billionaire oil CEOs & Execs in Houston while in law school & after, was engaged (briefly) to one - captains of industry are not nice ppl. They slit throats for a living. But I learned a lot about the industry.

7757 2018-07-07 21:01:07 Within a year we will find out all the russian players were robots taking synthetic oil based steroids
7758 2018-07-07 21:01:03 The work is to get the different users of Palmoil/vegetableoil to find alternativs to the use of vegetable oil.
7759 2018-07-07 21:00:49 The Liberals would rather have Arab, and Venezuelan oil than Canadian oil. Canada could be self sufficient but weak kneed politicos who bow to ecoterrorists are the problem. The U.S. nixed Paris & lowered their Carb footprint at the same time.

7766 2018-07-07 20:59:27 LOL, This is so true. And it is oil, so it doesn't really wash off.
7767 2018-07-07 20:59:19 yo @realDonaldTrump anything on #oil prices this weekend? cheers
7768 2018-07-07 20:58:57 I'm not a dipper. Just not sucked in by oil company propaganda. Alberta's problems stem from going "all in" on petroleum and relying on royalties to fund govt, benefiting current generation over future generations. We  gorge now, then ask "why" when tomorrow comes. Stupid.

7770 2018-07-07 20:58:35 All oil supplies disappear tommorrow
7771 2018-07-07 20:58:16 I love coconut oil
7772 2018-07-07 20:58:11 If the @TSN or @Sportsnet boys are talking about it, theres a lot of validity behind it and their track record kinda speaks for it. 

Of Course if its coming from a hockeybuzz or insiderrrrrr or a treenas oil or anyone who says theyre a head junior scout and in the know its BS
7773 2018-07-07 20:58:01 The 2 tail risk here is a spike in oil prices which would invert the yield curve.

There would be a spike in VIX but the market averages would adjust by moving assets to IYE, IDU, IYR and to a lesser extent XLP.  The EDV:TIP ratio favors TIP.  

Gives leverage to US v. China.
7774 2018-07-07 20:58:00 Uh...our entire oil sector is also a fraction of the value of such tech giants.

So...?
7775 2018-07-07 20:57:40 You’re still trying & still all mixed up. 
Synthetic crude is a heavy oil derivative. It’s in demand worldwide, as a result of Venezuela’s problems.... but our “fienly” liberal/NDP neighbours like to use oil without transporting it. Ask Quebec

7784 2018-07-07 20:56:51 Oil, coal, these are totally natural. That's the nature Rubio and the GOP care about.
7785 2018-07-07 20:56:45 Ok that is a little bit positiv, but im still in for a world wide ban of Palmoil together with Coco-nut oil and soya
7786 2018-07-07 20:56:42 Then, EVEN WITH the tremendous economic influence of oil, it still collapsed as they couldn’t compete. Socialism is the textbook case of the road to Hell being paved with good intentions.

7792 2018-07-07 20:55:59 Yes and different people can disagree with different interpretations. Like maybe for me n mehar Maryam Nawaz is anything but "nihati" which means akeli, helpless. So I rather use this particular couplet to describe the bravery of malala than a filthy rich n influential heiress.
7793 2018-07-07 20:55:46 "Permanent green"  First of all lol.  Second of all the grave tragedy is apparently that our planet might not be destroyed by oil companies.
7794 2018-07-07 20:55:31 Can’t go wrong with olive oil
7795 2018-07-07 20:55:17 The wind is blowing out here and all I smell is the coconut oil and dove soap I put on my skin

7797 2018-07-07 20:54:33 They do tend to shut up when shamed with someone who actually survived it. 

The only times socialism works are for brief moments when supported by unusual outside factors. 

Like Venuzela when oil supported it and then it collapsed under the weight without investment.
7798 2018-07-07 20:54:23 While Whole Foods marches into cyberspace, it is still a gorgeous day to go wildcrafting for herbs in the forest outside my door.  Got my castile soap with lavender and tea tree oil ready to wash off any brushes with poison ivy.  Mother Nature still wins.
7799 2018-07-07 20:54:06 The price of petrol has been decreased by Rs4.26 per litre, that of high-speed diesel by Rs6.37 per litre, kerosene oil by Rs3.36 per litre and the price of light diesel oil has been decreased by Rs5.54 per litre.
While it was increased Rs.20 just a weak ago.
7800 2018-07-07 20:54:05 Finally getting my oil changed LUUUULLLLLL. Should of asked my dad to do it but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ story of life
7801 2018-07-07 20:53:46 Because you don’t use cbd oil
7802 2018-07-07 20:53:35 Because oil companies and arms manufacturers own congress?
7803 2018-07-07 20:53:04 Some herbal products, such as peppermint oil, are included in orthodox medicines, then there are remedies such as Artemisia annua or artemisinin for malaria.

7805 2018-07-07 20:52:49 Thank you. It’s a one-time $10 to me and one-time $10 off for you. So nice to pair a Vitality oil with each one, too. Go with the recommended or choose your own.
7806 2018-07-07 20:52:45 I gotta let my shit grow and us coconut oil
7807 2018-07-07 20:52:43 We do a TON of work out of Houston. Our largest client is Exxon Mobil,  rather their purchasing arm. Business booms when oil prices are high. Not when production flows. I'm 100% serious.

7851 2018-07-07 20:47:44 I don't know why but it being in that metal container makes it look even dodgier right? It's actually for precisely measuring olive oil though
7852 2018-07-07 20:47:40 Cbd oil is expensive
7853 2018-07-07 20:47:29 I wonder if the eco styling gel with flaxseed oil and castor oil works.
7854 2018-07-07 20:47:20 The price of petrol has been decreased by Rs4.26 per litre, that of high-speed diesel by Rs6.37 per litre, kerosene oil by Rs3.36 per litre and the price of light diesel oil has been decreased by Rs5.54 per litre.

7856 2018-07-07 20:46:51 I got a phone screen protector from Kendall & Kylie and I didn’t realize that it was sparkly until after I bought it and now it looks like a bunch of oil and dirt is all over my screen fuck the Kardashians
7857 2018-07-07 20:46:44 Olive oil with break it down and the gum will come.right out. Lime some sort of miracle. Discovered that lime 2 years ago!
7858 2018-07-07 20:46:40 Pls tell something about oil price!:)

7860 2018-07-07 20:46:37 Autobots need a oil change
7861 2018-07-07 20:46:30 Texas is a bossy thinks they own their residence state. I thought it was too. Put it this way. The only resource in Texas is oil and I think they realize in years to come we won’t need it anymore. When oil goes so does many other businesses.
7862 2018-07-07 20:46:20 How much do you rely on petroleum products Dawn? I understand your environmental position and am all for less reliance on oil however it is not realistic for everyone and costly.
7863 2018-07-07 20:46:18 Cmon Russia  #RUSCRO
7864 2018-07-07 20:46:15 Ahh. yes.. all Oil Pipeline states. I wonder - oh wonder if OIL PIPELINES has anything to do with connections with Russia and doing Trump's bidding in trying to minimize the Russian issue.
7865 2018-07-07 20:46:13 Teas tree oil will be best friend
7866 2018-07-07 20:46:08 Mentioned the very same thing a couple of hours ago.....that was an oil barge.

7872 2018-07-07 20:44:30  This is a reminder to clean your phone! The oil and bacteria could clog your pores and cause breakouts!  
7873 2018-07-07 20:44:24 Aweomse! I like balm more than oil, myself.

7876 2018-07-07 20:43:40 If your chart shows the decline of drum corps, @DCI is partly at fault. Who bankrupt Blue Rock? Who bankrupt The Muchachos? Oil prices certainly didn't help. Corporate sponsorship was a fad. A lot of corps just couldn't compete any more. But some have come back successfully.
7877 2018-07-07 20:43:26 Changing oil and air filters is not a good idea in 130F heat in my garage.........
7878 2018-07-07 20:43:20 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
7879 2018-07-07 20:43:02 You must think big oil is in the oil business,

7882 2018-07-07 20:42:43 Oil companies are the most regulated industry in the United States. Name one thing that you do in your day-to-day life that doesn’t require oil, besides ranting and Raven about our president.

7892 2018-07-07 20:41:10 You ever heard of a snake oil salesman
7893 2018-07-07 20:40:53 Maybe, but it's 2018. The Tax Cut is being eaten away by rising oil prices and, likely, cancelled out by the price increases due to tariffs. The mid-terms are shaping up to be a referendum on court choices v. domestic impact of tariffs. Should be interesting.
7894 2018-07-07 20:40:43 traffic jams are just a conspiracy created by oil companies to waste fuel
7895 2018-07-07 20:40:34 sitting in jiffy lube for 2 hours on your only day off to pay $300 for registration and an oil change has got to be the epitome of how shitty adulthood can be.

7897 2018-07-07 20:40:18 I know!! They even have avocado oil for cooking too. Like I’ve tried eating it once & it didn’t go too well. Maybe I should try again on a different dish or something maybe.

7901 2018-07-07 20:40:07 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7902 2018-07-07 20:39:56 I don't think so because they only such blood from Middle Eastern Oil wells such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lybia etc
7903 2018-07-07 20:39:56 Oil a cooking sheet, cook on top rack (if available), 650-700 for around 5 minutes
7904 2018-07-07 20:39:53 Spilled coconut oil all over my kitchen floor. My funeral will be tomorrow afternoon
7905 2018-07-07 20:39:49 We have an MD with a #2 engine oil issue and I joked about bringing extra and refilling in-flight. Maint. Controller said “in the Air Force we actually would service the oil in-flight on the Pave Low.”

7909 2018-07-07 20:38:42 I'm thinking it's the other way round.  Israel dances to a tune played by the US oil industry.  They need continuous instability to justify military options, to make sure they get the oil.
7910 2018-07-07 20:38:40 Dogshit article. Nice to see pro oil propganda columns alive and well. You do know the death that oil companies themselves bring? The massive income inequality that is from them, war profiteers and banks? The fact you go against the people with no money or power is laughable.
7911 2018-07-07 20:38:40 too slick. they should call me can of oil. westside
7912 2018-07-07 20:38:35 How is your great relationship with Kim Jon-un?  Does this mean, @realDonaldTrump, that the provocative & costly war games are back on?  Still thinking about pulling troops out of S Korea? You aren’t going to let Russia provide N Korea oil, are you? Another Art of the No Deal!
7913 2018-07-07 20:38:30 Because of Russia's aggression on Ukraine Merkel said Germany should increase defence's spendings. Spendings for Russia's oil and gas purchases, as it's seen, Germany is not planning to decrease.
7914 2018-07-07 20:38:27 Last day smoking just gone be on that oil for now on
7915 2018-07-07 20:38:11 Oh yeah.. I warm up my popcorn oil for 3 minutes instead of 2..
7916 2018-07-07 20:38:01 Oil the runways?
7917 2018-07-07 20:37:56 Yeah, I had a prescription for two different oils.  They did not work for my pain.  I was up to 6ml of the yellow strand and it did nothing.  I took 3 ml of the blue oil and I was stoned out of my face.  I could move my legs.  So I stoped that one as well.
7918 2018-07-07 20:37:33 People take forever to do an oil change.

When he takes my car and fill up the tank, gets an oil change, vacuum and wash all in the same day 
7922 2018-07-07 20:36:37 What costs so damn much? Are they drizzling truffle oil on the kids? They couldn't possibly justify this with faux-fanciness.
All kids need are wooden blocks, some board-books, and a kind caregiver.
7923 2018-07-07 20:36:00 Blow drying bad for it brodie, but throw some beard oil in before hand to help.
7924 2018-07-07 20:35:38 Bro a simple oil change from my dad turns into let me check the transmission fluid to let me check the tire pressure to let me clean the windows  dad all I neede was a oil change 
7925 2018-07-07 20:35:32 No, these are Aframax oil tankers and very little of this activity involving ships this large has been happening through the Burrard Inlet so far...let alone daily.
7926 2018-07-07 20:35:30 What in the hell is a "zero-sum understanding?"

Would you like some oil and vinegar with that word salad?
7927 2018-07-07 20:35:29 Fact remains that america successfully contained the USSR and allies after ww2 forcing them to spent all its money on defense, making sure to cut everyone out who refused to be on their side so they cant sell. The last nail wasn't collectivization it was the collapsing oil market

7937 2018-07-07 20:33:43 es el ultimo mundial que vemos en rusia ese mundial esta comprado croacia hace faltas con el codo y se agacha para meter el codo y no la pierna. es una verguenza. y ahora a penalty y modric y raquitich fallaran sus penalty.
7938 2018-07-07 20:33:38 Those dishwashing detergent commercials where they clean up the fallout of oil spills are so damn sad.
7939 2018-07-07 20:33:29 I make mine with avocado oil. My wife hates mayo but makes an exception for mine.
7940 2018-07-07 20:33:14 Its sold as a Cure but I see it as say 4 extra litres of oil that go to recycling that may as well be used on the next service. Why waste it
7941 2018-07-07 20:32:52 THAT was a thing. Russia ties it with a header near the end of 2nd overtime. Home crowd goes berserk, Putin applies oil to torso. #WorldCup2018

It deserves investigating what American Blx played was first to play baseball in college? That's more important
7948 2018-07-07 20:31:43 Also I might end up in a&e tonight cause I touched coconut oil and I'm allergic...I can feel it in my waters
7949 2018-07-07 20:31:27 I woke up early today to get my oil changed before 8:30 AM because I am today's #SaturdayLibrarian and I am started to regret it. It has been a fast day up until now which is the perfect combo to induce naptime.

4. Don’t be afraid of being wrong
7952 2018-07-07 20:31:01 @iamsamkeller for your birthday i am watching an episode of survivor where they literally oil up the contestants

7954 2018-07-07 20:30:21 Mexico has oil, you moron.
7955 2018-07-07 20:30:13 Their point was countries will limit selling. I have never seen such desperate attempt to justify their oil long position
7956 2018-07-07 20:30:09 Stop by our nearby Wetzone Car Wash and let us help you get ready for your upcoming road trip. Regular maintenance such as oil & lube changes help keep your vehicle road trip ready.
7957 2018-07-07 20:30:05 I logged on just for this today. Thank you.
7958 2018-07-07 20:30:00 Norway also has the North Sea oil reserves.  When those reserves fail the government will collapse.
7959 2018-07-07 20:29:57 Just as I see it. A marketing ploy. There will always be some old oil lurking around but a low percentage.
7960 2018-07-07 20:29:43 Not like it’s effective sef 
7961 2018-07-07 20:29:33 Ontario ppl think all ppl in Alberta do in wear coveralls & drill for oil

I guess it was only a matter of time 
7966 2018-07-07 20:28:37 None :( sweaty upper lips and oil highlighted cheekbones are in!
7967 2018-07-07 20:28:35 Well I know critical thinking is hard for the faithful, but if RF was so cost effective you would have to fight off investors with a stick. Here’s a clue. Exxon wants to sell you something, right now they sell oil, but Exxon didn’t care to sell oil Exxon just wants to sell.
7968 2018-07-07 20:28:33 Also, any climate scientist that conducted a rigorous study that refuted the concensus view would a) get high impact publications and b) have a bunch of oil money funding further studies.

7973 2018-07-07 20:27:47 Finally got my oil changed 
7974 2018-07-07 20:27:28 I know the English ain't oil paintings but the Croatian and Russian teams are flippin' butt-ugly....
7975 2018-07-07 20:27:03 Tofurky is alright.  I prefer Field Roast Products.  Gardein had a great Vegan Roast for a few years though I haven't seen this in awhile.  If I use a Tofurky Roast, I glaze with balsamic vinegrette and use garlic, olive oil and Italian Seasoning. 
7976 2018-07-07 20:27:01 I always feel so independent after changing my oil 
7977 2018-07-07 20:27:00 Also, everyone has the RIGHT to any action which only they have to handle the consequences of. We have every right in the world to eat strictly cookies, and drink olive oil, and smoke cigarettes and crack and sit on our ass all day. That's nobody's "problem" but their own.
7978 2018-07-07 20:26:39 Need to oil my scalp, it’s dry & itchy 
7979 2018-07-07 20:26:21 When you have a problem, the solution is coconut oil

7981 2018-07-07 20:25:59 Get some of that oil I used to fix ur dip brow and then brush it
7982 2018-07-07 20:25:55 Yeah apparently when they first started talking he would call her but (and get ready for how obvious this is) he had to call using some sort of voice box telephone thing because he was offshore on some oil rigs in Scotland. 
7983 2018-07-07 20:25:52 Oil change light comes on the same day its 100 out...yeah I’ll do my Uber thing today
7984 2018-07-07 20:25:29 It is an issue of science but you might want to have words with Al Gore if you think it was just the oil industry that politicized it.

7991 2018-07-07 20:24:20 Gosh, I will never understand you Americans. You say oil and lobster equals wealth, corn on the cob equals poverty and you idolise guns.  Also you think telling your kids that "You noped the fuck out of there" makes them think you're cool, "I shat my pants" makes you seem awesome
7992 2018-07-07 20:24:18 I figured it was only right to celebrate a @KazGrala @FuryRaceCars top 5 by ordering a bottle of @TheOliveFruit Extra Virgin Olive Oil!
7993 2018-07-07 20:24:12 The reduction of Bill Cosby to a nobody was inspired by middle class American blx preachers and evangelist because Bill Cosby fix for American blx went against the snake oil they were peddling on spitful summit.written on stone. Bill Cosby is/was the right person for the job.
7994 2018-07-07 20:24:03 Lol, I work in the oil field, we work just about every day 12 to 14 hours a day that is a lot harder work than picking strawberries! Yes they get shitty pay and not taking anything away from the work they do! But working your ass off for 30 to 40 days straight on a rig is harder

7996 2018-07-07 20:23:27 Russia’s number one export is natural gas and oil. Second largest coal reserves. 

Senators w/pipeline running through their states meet with Putin. It’s about oil, gas, coal & money. 

If these Senators propose removing sanctions against Russia, this will be abuse of power @GOP
7997 2018-07-07 20:23:09 Well they placed the fate of the world on Obama and now are placing it on the new socialist primary winner in NY  so I guess in their mind it's feasible one guy can bring it down.
7998 2018-07-07 20:23:04 I still can't see the oil and gas companies suddenly behaving ethically when we disinvest. They won't. We need rigor, clarity and courage these are critical times. Withdrawing from the situation isn't what The TPI nor the Oxford amendment is about. Let's make a different together
7999 2018-07-07 20:23:04 Russia should hav bought this match with oil money
8000 2018-07-07 20:22:33 *standing ovation* 
Try coconut oil with two vitamin E capsules after every two days. Then tell me about results 
8001 2018-07-07 20:22:23 Sounds perfect. My favorite simple meal is zucchini noodles sauteed in olive oil with freshly minced garlic.

8003 2018-07-07 20:22:13 Yes! I once or twice used good hand lotion. But coconut oil sounds genius.

8005 2018-07-07 20:21:40 Lol!! Took my husband's truck for an oil change and he recommended a new cabin filter. I said "oh really?? That's funny since this truck doesn't HAVE a cabin filter. He was like oh, sorry!! 
8006 2018-07-07 20:21:34 We can’t be emotional and blame petrol rise to Pres Ramaphosa. He does not control oil producing countries and oil markets that’s has increased crude oil.  All economies has experience increased in petrol what makes us different?
8007 2018-07-07 20:21:22 No. I'm using cbd oil
8008 2018-07-07 20:21:15 Totally am.
8009 2018-07-07 20:21:09 Wen mineral oil sir?
8010 2018-07-07 20:21:08 The US Republican Party is the only political party in the civilized world denying climate change. They are also the recipients of HUGE donations from Big Oil. Not hard to connect the dots. Even if climate change we’re not real, it is to the USA benefit to wean off oil.
8011 2018-07-07 20:21:01 The moment I don’t have tea tree oil smh
8012 2018-07-07 20:20:58 I've made some rosemary essential oil room spray in the hour of Jupiter so I guess I'm that person now
8013 2018-07-07 20:20:51 Poorly. You could always eat vegan protein powder, coconut oil and a ton of dark leafy greens.
8014 2018-07-07 20:20:34 This baby oil got my hair hella soft
8015 2018-07-07 20:20:28 the most i put in my hair is oil but that’s like once every week.
8016 2018-07-07 20:20:27 Dude would you use engine flush? I just warm it up a tad and run the old stuff out, and change the oil filter.
8017 2018-07-07 20:20:24 Dude, we KNOW you're usin' engine oil for lube and typing one handed.... just give up, MAGAt.

8019 2018-07-07 20:20:11 Did you use aromatherapy massage oil? It's always help me to relaxed my muscle and my mind :)
8020 2018-07-07 20:20:10 What about coconut oil? I put some in my coffee every morning.
8021 2018-07-07 20:20:10 "...."

Pulls it out.

8026 2018-07-07 20:19:39 The USA no longer has the international clout to stop, or cause Iran to sell less oil. Bullying as a foreign policy is not without consequences.
8027 2018-07-07 20:19:35 @PrimalKitchenCo avocado mayo is the bomb! Fck Kraft sugar added seed oil laden garbage.

8030 2018-07-07 20:19:26 lately i’ve been liking soft makeup, glossy lips & smelling like vanilla (vanilla essential oil + citrus oil).

8032 2018-07-07 20:19:14 Try it - with high quality olive oil, that’s the key.
8033 2018-07-07 20:19:08 [1/2] Not 100% sure of the exact science, but the idea is that cotton pillow cases absorb sebum from your skin and oil from your hair and can cause friction, oil build up, etc. + since they absorb it, your skin and hair might want to produce more of it...

8042 2018-07-07 20:17:30 I do believe that the UK grows the most legal medical cannabis in the world, yet only one person has a licence to use it & that's CBD oil with 2% THC. A lack of patients is null and void. 
8043 2018-07-07 20:17:27 Whats the benefit of taking castor oil? Been seeing people recommend it
8044 2018-07-07 20:17:20 That's a lie, access to goods only, not services.

Leaves science & research, banking, legal, IT, renewables research, oil & gas advisory, video games etc etc etc to suffer under tariffs. 
All because London wants to launder dirty money from around the world it couldn't do in EU

8060 2018-07-07 20:14:55 The other question is why up until this administration, oil prices were regularly talked about and attached to the President (good or bad)?
8061 2018-07-07 20:14:47 Just because you can find propaganda this huge oil state puts out doesn’t make it so.  Wake up.  Again - I was there. Indigenous led compost area cleaner than most campgrounds.  Strict clean up rules.

8064 2018-07-07 20:14:16 You have my vote if you deny ALL drilling for oil, off the coast of Florida.   Many feel the same.

8071 2018-07-07 20:13:37 If an oil company brings you back as an expat, no NYSC needed. But when you leave the oil company and want to work for a bank, you will need a certificate.

8086 2018-07-07 20:09:30 @SecretaryPerry Mr. Secretary:
When will US separate from foreign oil and rely upon our own reserves? 
With our great state, and others, the independence decision should be a favored position. OPEN has been oppressing USA and robbing USA for long enough.
8087 2018-07-07 20:09:09 How do other countries control the United States? 

Answer: Oil

We have to get over 50% of our oil supply from other countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia. On top of that, Other countries also hold ownership stock in our chemical plants. Imagine that! #Aramco

8095 2018-07-07 20:07:35 Idk why Randy thought it was a good idea to drop me off at the mall while he got his oil changed #Ivespenttoomuchalready #itbelikethatsometimes
8096 2018-07-07 20:07:18 went to a dealership today that offers free oil changes for life and free manicures while you wait
8097 2018-07-07 20:07:06 Something else she said while she was pointing on the oil pipes. She said Iran’s gov can easily run oil pips from this lands for the interest of inner cities but can not bring water pipes for people who live in Arab region SW Iran. Discrimination and racism.

8103 2018-07-07 20:05:53 Had a good time last night none but good vibes  but the oil did me so dirty 
8104 2018-07-07 20:05:30 Our better crude sells at a higher price but bitumen is sold at a lower price because Canada does not refine it. If we refined it here we would get better prices. The oil companies don’t build the refineries so who you bitching about
8105 2018-07-07 20:05:29 Rose water and tea tree oil work wonderssssss on my skin omg 
8106 2018-07-07 20:05:25 I think Trump and Putin will take the tack that they don't really hurt Russia (oil price is a killer though) but hurt America by not allowing cooperation on big oil deals, Arctic exploitation

Trump expected to cancel sanctions long ago which is why Tillerson was Sec of State.
8107 2018-07-07 20:05:23 someone teach me about cars and how to change my own damn oil.
8108 2018-07-07 20:05:18 I need another alternative to wild growth oil, I hate the smell and it seeps through my head scarf.
8109 2018-07-07 20:05:14 @FamosoPizzeria did all store change their recipes lately or just the GP store after they closed down for a bit? The flat bread olive oil topping is awful now. The kitchen say they made “minor tweaks”...
8110 2018-07-07 20:05:06 And the GMB has promised to do what exactly? I've worked in the offshore oil industry for 27yrs and can't remember pay and conditions being worse. Where are the GMB, UNITE, RMT?
8111 2018-07-07 20:04:59 You're right. They aren't. But they are exploiting the American people for personal gain. Whether I buy into it, someone else is. Just like every other snake oil salesman. I'll keep calling them out just as long as they keep trying.
8112 2018-07-07 20:04:56 Depends on the gum - oil may help, or alchohol.
8113 2018-07-07 20:04:55 "Oil Tot" your braver then I am. Even with me enjoying horror including Japanese horror which the Japanese knows how to scare the hell out of you I still don't want clowns in my life.
8114 2018-07-07 20:04:49 Bad math. What counts is the % of sunshine not reflected or absorbed by plant life etc. Only that "net" actually heats the planet. Oil consumption is a much more significant % of that.
8115 2018-07-07 20:04:35 They say if you leave in the pit then store it in the fridge in an air tight container with a chopped onion, or coat it with olive oil.
8116 2018-07-07 20:04:33 Impossible. He was raised by wolves. Or radical leftists. Not sure which is worse.
8117 2018-07-07 20:04:31 People cry about the wage gap, but I don't see any women applying to work on the 110 degree factory floor or covered in oil on a drilling rig alongside me. They're teaching and being nannies. Of course there's gonna be a gap between those.
8118 2018-07-07 20:04:25 You mean, the dinosaurs are responsible for processing crude oil into the fuel that they then ignite and burn into the engines they designed that pollute the atmosphere?
8119 2018-07-07 20:04:22 The vacuum was created when they hung hussein period. And it was no jv. Let me reiterate, iraq was sitting on 2nd largest oil reserve in the world and iraqi army was no joke. When secular leadership was killed, the sunni stepped up. Sunnis blew up the twins in ny. NOT JV ever.
8120 2018-07-07 20:04:20 Harp oil (for the strings)
8121 2018-07-07 20:04:00 Don’t know why but I just love getting my oil changed.
8122 2018-07-07 20:04:00 I swear this orange-scented essential oil I'm running in a diffuser right now is so potent I feel like I've snorted a citrus grove.

Might need to use a lot less next time. Or just dilute this with some more water.
8123 2018-07-07 20:03:54 I need someone to give my car an oil change so I don't waste my time and i can continue to paint sos serious inquiriez ONLY

8125 2018-07-07 20:03:40 That would be fascism, which I would argue this country already is. An oil company with an army.
8126 2018-07-07 20:03:36 Maybe big oil, the shorts and FUDers are playing the really long game, both sides and all that stuff 
8127 2018-07-07 20:03:36 Natural Flavor

The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.
8128 2018-07-07 20:03:24 Except for @Patootys coconut oil, i'm not sure of anyone. 
8129 2018-07-07 20:03:14 Double Russia's... even with oil bring up 2x.
8130 2018-07-07 20:03:08 Curious which other oil patch corporations should not advertise in the petroleum research and production center of the entire planet, to help sustain the local baseball club. I don't know which ones I'm supposed to be upset about. We need more politics in baseball, obviously.
8131 2018-07-07 20:02:55 Gotta go change my cars oil then the stream will be live!
8132 2018-07-07 20:02:33 wanna talk about pretty girl privileges?

8133 2018-07-07 20:02:11 I just sat in oil with my new shorts </3
8134 2018-07-07 20:01:53 What I'm learning today is that the equestrian crowd and soccer crowd are VERY different...like oil and water.
8135 2018-07-07 20:01:51 It's part of the golan Heights oil deal probably.
8136 2018-07-07 20:01:51 One polluter benefit of global warming:  heavy crude oil, warmed past boiling by murderous heat, will flow very quickly through the patched-up leaky pipelines.

8141 2018-07-07 20:01:12 Kind of makes sense if you ignore reality. Obama red line enforced.  NATO pressured to spend more.  USA military budget increased.  Oil drilling and Canadian pipeline approved.  All things your supposed puppet master would not want.
8142 2018-07-07 20:01:05 try using castor oil i hear it works wonders for growing hair, this shampoo ive been using also gives me hella volume my hair was getting so thin at one point :/ its the Joico Kpak gold bottles for color treated hair at Ulta
8143 2018-07-07 20:01:05 Dad asked me what avocado oil was. I told him, "oil from an avocado." He got fussy cause apparently that's not a satisfactory answer. 
8144 2018-07-07 20:00:57 Oribe or Moroccan Oil
8145 2018-07-07 20:00:47 A drop or two of baby oil will help your rabbit stop scratching at his ears.
8146 2018-07-07 20:00:44 Penn east is moving crude oil or nat gas????  Hasnt this penn east project been in the works since obama???

Please give me money!
8148 2018-07-07 20:00:07 Absolutely. Especially when it's profit over people like #land, #religion, #silk, #pepper, #slaves, #furs, #whaleblubber, #coal, #oil, #data, #debt, ad nauseum.
8149 2018-07-07 20:00:00 I’ve started using a sulfate- and paraben free shampoo, a silicone free moisturizer, a microfiber hair towel and a diluted lavender oil blend on my face (for skin! Don’t use reg esstential oils). I only eat pescatarian and cut down sugar and dairy. My skin and hair look awesome!!
8150 2018-07-07 19:59:57 Follow the oil money.

8153 2018-07-07 19:59:20 Isis was formed by the murder of Hussein, they were his generals bankrolled by oil revenue (iraq at the time was #2 producer in the world. They sold it to turkey and really anyone who would turn a blind eye. Demon Cheney created isis not obama. As bad as isis is, they are more
8154 2018-07-07 19:59:14 On her third shot of lemon oil already.  I have to cut ol' Beatrice off soon.
8155 2018-07-07 19:59:01 try a fucking oil tanker lad fully loaded
8156 2018-07-07 19:58:58 Malthus believed there was a sustainable population level and many politicians seem to think the same thing. The competition for natural resources, like water, land and the almighty drops of oil and chunks of coal are some of the greatest challenges of the last 100 years.
8157 2018-07-07 19:58:53 I would suggest only lightly bbq’ing it.  Maybe with drizzle of olive oil....
8158 2018-07-07 19:58:10 malas dah nak kerja sebenarnya. elok jadi bos diri sendiri ja. takda apa yang indah pun oil and gas ni
8159 2018-07-07 19:58:09 Enjoy! I barbecued salmon and chicken. And sweet peppers. It was nice. Forgot to oil the fish so then skin stuck though 
8160 2018-07-07 19:57:57 R they different strains or do some have that canna oil stuff on it? Either way I’m jealous af im out until my husband gets home from work
8161 2018-07-07 19:57:56 - The word is that government of certain African country will not give license to Exxon for major oil findings, you should get rid of their stock and short them as soon as possible.
- Is that true?
- Trust me, I have it on good authority.
8162 2018-07-07 19:57:33 GOT ENOUGH OLIVE OIL THERE BIG DOG?!
8163 2018-07-07 19:57:19 GOP are now Russian agents! Want to lift sanctions so they can get CA ching! Russian oil money!
8164 2018-07-07 19:56:51 Look – Russia is a dirt poor oil nation. Billionaires there run the country like a Mafia. Donald Trump couldn't get money anywhere else because he's bad at business, so he had to go to Deutche Bank, which launders Russian money. He owes them billions. It's that dumb. #TrumpRussia
8165 2018-07-07 19:56:31 Voluntarily consumed a teaspoon of castor oil. On my own, with no supervision.
I win the adulting olympics.
8166 2018-07-07 19:56:28 well. that will be my life. can't use sun cream cause of allergies. so coconut oil is all I have 
8167 2018-07-07 19:56:21 I just changed the oil in my car by myself. im my own boyfriend now
8168 2018-07-07 19:55:29 No it's not--this guy clearly doesn't get the connection between a healthy oil industry and his paycheck but then again...what public employee does?
8169 2018-07-07 19:55:22 GOP are now Russian agents! Want to lift sanctions so they can get CA ching! Russian oil money!
8170 2018-07-07 19:55:20 i use coconut oil for taking them off and that helps mine grow
8171 2018-07-07 19:55:13 I still think you should reassess the snake oil sales people on the left and #WalkAway. They are pushing falsehoods wrapped in emotion.
8172 2018-07-07 19:54:18 It is, our car just broke down on the bridge, I came out and I could feel it shaking
8173 2018-07-07 19:54:18 Went to get an oil change today and it came with a regular car wash but the guy remembered me and gave me a $30 car wash instead for free
8174 2018-07-07 19:54:09 Adrian: babe i hear racers!!!
Me: dont even think about it. Still needs an oil change
Adrian: what?! I gave you a whole week
Me: yeah n you wasted a whole ass week you said you’re payin for it. 
8175 2018-07-07 19:53:59 Yeah but my car isn’t :( my front bumper is fucked and it’s leaking since last night. I think it’s the radiator and hopefully my oil pan isn’t cracked
8176 2018-07-07 19:53:56 Have you thought about moonlighting as a stand-up comedienne in oil city?
8177 2018-07-07 19:53:56 caster oil.
8178 2018-07-07 19:53:28 To look at the guy you would never believe that he is only 50 years old. Sounds like he needs the money so he will find a job in the private sector with his buddies in oil and gas.
He will never get into trouble for anything he did while in the Cabinet.
8179 2018-07-07 19:53:28 If I could have only put a wager "@yekvat" had God somewhere in their profile. God and Trump go together like oil and water. Well, maybe not the best analogy, but you get my point.
8180 2018-07-07 19:53:27 Wetin dey pain me be say, with this your history, there's no where you can't work. Oil company, engineering comp, hospital, telecoms, no where.

As long as the TLs hold strong we'll get out of this rut in the green. #really4myownsanity

The Federal Republic of Nigeria will now have oil in the south south and cattle in the north east. What a lovely country it will be.
8191 2018-07-07 19:52:00 The oceans absorb co2. They are literally a carbon sink. The more co2 the more acidic. As to where the money is... Its in carbon fuels like oil and gas. In the trillions; not so much climate science.

8231 2018-07-07 19:46:29 Zarif didn’t wait for joint statement because he wanted to show he was satisfied with it (risk it would be seen as underwhelming given its general nature). China chided Iran b/c they hate oil price volatility. They did not seek to withdraw a package—there was no package.

8241 2018-07-07 19:44:33 That's so cool! One of my favorite moments:
We were trapped in a hallway filled w/ lizard monsters & we hatched a crazy plan: dip a chain in oil, set in on fire, & have our orc friend throw it.
IT WORKED & we cleared the entire hall w/ a flaming buzzsaw of death! RPGs are so wild

8260 2018-07-07 19:42:23 Speculative thesis: We've reached an inflection point where renewables and energy efficiency tech mean rising oil prices are a net good both for the environment and for long-term economic growth.
8261 2018-07-07 19:42:22 @realDonaldTrump Please move to have CBD oil changed from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II drug at the FEDERAL level. With the push to curb opioid prescriptions, it is leaving millions of legitimate chronic pain sufferers with no alternative medications. CBD oil would help.

8278 2018-07-07 19:40:10 Could you also fill this thing with oil and increase the fires instead?

8281 2018-07-07 19:40:04 Instead of having oil wars.  And immigration is way down as compared to previous years.  Most are seeking asylum.  Be human.  They took babies away from their mothers.  That’s just wrong.

8284 2018-07-07 19:39:35 What a stupid question. Oil is a finite resource. Either electric or some other technology or back to bikes.

8292 2018-07-07 19:38:07 I’ve never worried overly much about the product vs headphones but I am allergic to a common ingredient in a lot of products and oils. So I guess I am more concerned w/ me. I often use Moroccan Oil products & haven’t witnessed any issues. My headphones have velvety fabric pads.

I’ll do anything not to use bug spray.
8331 2018-07-07 19:34:04 why not just write oil?

8351 2018-07-07 19:30:32 No man... this was ages ago... the price recently increased due to the fluctuating rand and oil price... the solution to our problems lies way beyond a decrease in a levy... there is major infrasture needed in the industry to lesson the dependence on the oil price.

8357 2018-07-07 19:29:59 Water not Oil is going to be the prize to have. Ask Nestlé who have already worked out "its" interpretation of the average household needs and I believe are trying to have water reclassified as a commodity thus allow Corporations like them to buy rivers etc domestic or foreign.

8392 2018-07-07 19:24:42 Would you rather profiteering or profit, or revenue or income? All these terms would be termed corruption when a certain threshold is crossed. But in actual fact corruption is that oil that greases the wheel of most businesses achieve by subterfuge.
8393 2018-07-07 19:24:25 Through an #OilStandard lens I would say energy (oil) cost & dollar cost (debt-based on capitalised US location/land rental/use value via mortgage loans which create $) diverged at the #OilStandard launch @ErikSTownsend @chigrl

Oil became $$$$ in 1973, shell corporations fm tax havens used as consortia. In 87 Regan made Pravda possible. All coming together under  Putin

8401 2018-07-07 19:22:59 Such propaganda with #zero details,how-to,what-after,full only of blind emotions like this one always reminds me nazi schema of propaganda by Goebels.

8410 2018-07-07 19:20:01 Crystal, go get clove oil. You can buy it alone or it comes in the “tooth ache kit” at drug stores. It smells and tastes awful, but it works amazing!! It numbs really fast and works much better than orajel. I hope this will help a little. I feel your pain!
8411 2018-07-07 19:19:38 I was tryna put the oil away and it slipped outta my hand  long story short everything in the kitchen is oily #fml
8412 2018-07-07 19:19:34 Unfortunately Nigeria bring a Cocoa producing nation has focused mainly on oil.
8413 2018-07-07 19:19:28 No Assad.he did not kill any of his people your brainwashed.
That was total lie given out by western media.All a set-up to steal oil.and land
Wake up man.
Am not going to educate you”
Go find out both sides” of the story’
Not western press.
You don’t talk fact” just rhetoric.
8414 2018-07-07 19:19:12 I desperately need to go get an oil change, but I also need a nap... what order shall I do this in??
8415 2018-07-07 19:19:08 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
8416 2018-07-07 19:19:08 Lovely new jumpsuit on today, so far I’ve managed to pluck and rip my left leg and get bbq oil all over it all in the space of 30 minutes! 
8417 2018-07-07 19:19:06 Blunt weather but all I got is oil
8418 2018-07-07 19:18:57 I agree that one must protest against democracy being undermined, but it’s disingenuous when most commentators believe that army the only one undermining democracy. civilian rulers equally culpable
8419 2018-07-07 19:18:50 Oh dear wolf ! I was wondering earlier if Im naive and too nice overall.
or whether I am  right..will I ever know. Probably not.
8420 2018-07-07 19:18:49 Well as most of them appear to be sub-Arthur Daley second hand snake oil purveyors it shouldn't be to much of a challenge for the slimy wretches. #StopBrexit
8421 2018-07-07 19:18:17 And the same with it’s oil
8422 2018-07-07 19:18:06 During my internship at Tenneco Inc. last summer, I compiled a list of oil consumption
8423 2018-07-07 19:18:00 Yo, I’ll give someone $30 if they can change my oil for me today please
8424 2018-07-07 19:17:38 American oil companies are running the show.
8425 2018-07-07 19:17:21 I have rekindled my love of chinese pepper oil.
8426 2018-07-07 19:17:18 Got to my oil change early, and I’m being treated like the biggest inconvenience they have ever had. 
8427 2018-07-07 19:17:12 Not angry or full rage; most of us are just disappointed that many of our fellow citizens are so gullible as to buy the snack oil, too stupid to see it and/or so lacking in empathy, compassion or patriotic concern to say something.
8428 2018-07-07 19:17:05 We invaded Iraq for the oil.  Check black market sales numbers.  Taxpayers paid to make rich elitists richer.  That no doubt included the traitor Bush regime.  We still pay for those invasions.  Tax dollars that could help America.
8429 2018-07-07 19:17:00 Texas A&M have hired the biggest bust in coaching.Ego and oil money aren't the answer.
8430 2018-07-07 19:16:54 I work in the oil and gas industry and I once heard someone say, if it only affects an area and but benefits the nation let’s do it. They don’t care about one state, they care about profit. It’s sad
8431 2018-07-07 19:16:46 I kinda miss using oil pastels for coloring
8432 2018-07-07 19:16:39 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
8433 2018-07-07 19:16:33 So happy I got an oil pen
8434 2018-07-07 19:16:33 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
8435 2018-07-07 19:16:29 Just found out my Toro mower never needs the oil changed.....why can’t they make vehicles like that?? #fortsask
8436 2018-07-07 19:16:17 Looks like OIL is well
8437 2018-07-07 19:16:12 Surprised at the pushback on the plastic straw ban from putative progressives. Big Oil's plastic subsidiaries are getting a whole lot of help from people who claim to oppose Big Oil.
8438 2018-07-07 19:15:56 Yes, because the @GOP works for the Russians and the goal is to destroy America so they can get their share of the Rosneft Oil Deal.  The only one saying this publicly is Aunt Maxine so of course they smear her.
8439 2018-07-07 19:15:45 Data is the new Oil. Don't sleep on how data is being collected, harvested and then repackage in the form of a new service or product.
8440 2018-07-07 19:15:37 Lmao... Boss
8441 2018-07-07 19:15:26 it’s not Nawaz’s corruption I condone, it’s a system that systematically undermines democracy I condemn. Accountability even selective is ok
8442 2018-07-07 19:15:16 my sekrit plan to take over the world with MCT coconat oil!
8443 2018-07-07 19:15:14 I use Jamaican black castor oil and eating pums don’t help for me 
8444 2018-07-07 19:15:02 The art of the deal Putin gets oil, trump gets the 2018 election to keep him in power. Better watch for a fixed election.
8445 2018-07-07 19:14:26 They are Hyundai. So don't buy a Hyundai. They raised $20m through an ICO with, I believe, a lot of S Korean individual investors. Snake oil the lot of it.
8446 2018-07-07 19:14:22 getting ur oil change hella irritatin
8447 2018-07-07 19:14:21 Not in any way at all, thankfully. Although I do have very strong opinions on the snake oil he sells.

8449 2018-07-07 19:14:13 Scottish oil has been subsidising Westminster for over 40 years!!!
8450 2018-07-07 19:14:10 I am there but i cannot give up fish and mayonnaise so far. Mayo alternatives seem to incorporate lots of rapeseed oil which is bad. I just need to learn about other options.  Chick peas kill my stomach. Thanks for your encouragement though. Suggestions welcome.
8451 2018-07-07 19:14:05 Obviously the Well was not abandoned properly. Welcome to the world of oil and gas, offshore and onshore.
8452 2018-07-07 19:13:43 When two guys with suits ring my front door bell, I wonder if they are cult members, politicians, or snake oil salesmen.

Then I think, Is there really a difference?
8453 2018-07-07 19:13:42 After I complained about my oily face my BF called me a beautiful oil painting 
8454 2018-07-07 19:13:41 Oil has accelerated our progress. CO2 has built trees. Can't we all just get along? If you want to help go after real pollution.
8455 2018-07-07 19:13:40 Gold...
8456 2018-07-07 19:13:05 Um, these are percentages. Population size is irrelevant. Oil prices, however, are super pertinent.
8457 2018-07-07 19:13:00 #oott if no @realDonaldTrump  tweet this weekend, oil price will fall next week.
8458 2018-07-07 19:12:35 Sounds like a great time...
Next time try baby oil..

8461 2018-07-07 19:12:00 Don’t put factor 8 oil on your face or you’ll leave an English beach looking like a mf tomato ;P
8462 2018-07-07 19:12:00 More Brussels sprouts ?!?! Or cod liver oil 
8463 2018-07-07 19:11:56 That is extremely unfortunate.

Maybe if the oil industry wasn't such a total loss, and the death of advancement, we would have something nice to trade to Kim, but thanks to all the JP Morgans and Rockefellers etc out there, we are caught in nuclear stalemate over obsolete shit.
8464 2018-07-07 19:11:51 I'm just an oil mogul down from Dallas, and, well, I'm itching like a hound to give you a-something you want

8472 2018-07-07 19:11:04 We want to pollute the air, promote coal and oil while hamstringing renewables, expand fracking, ignore science and deny global warming is a thing during an unprecedented string of heat-record-breaking years, but it should be done by honest people.
8473 2018-07-07 19:10:57 That a lot of US oil development takes place on land with freehold mineral rights while most in AB takes place on crown land?
8474 2018-07-07 19:10:55 Coal & oil are dead ends
8475 2018-07-07 19:10:40 These oil companies you speak of. Are these the public companies that everyone is free to invest in?  Including civil servant police fire and teacher pensions (which invest heavily)?  It's more complicated than 6 oil barons all getting rich, too much Disney in your youth!
8476 2018-07-07 19:10:29 If you use No Toil filters, their cleaner and oil works great.  I always noticed an increase in power also with No Toil.
8477 2018-07-07 19:10:26 Okay so. I wing the measurements but this is what I use: Sashimi grade tuna or salmon cut into small cubes, sesame oil, sesame seeds, soy sauce, finely chopped ginger (normal or pickled, pickled makes it sweeter), finely chopped garlic, chives, cubed avocado...

8481 2018-07-07 19:10:02 Don't fill up on the cheddar bay biscuits.  Even though they are delicious, they're loaded with fat and oil, and therefore delicious but bad for you.  Save your appetite for the seafood!
8482 2018-07-07 19:09:54 I have an idea: what about a map that shows oil and gas royalties collected for AB vs US states. What would we learn?

8486 2018-07-07 19:09:28 They are. It just reminded me of when we used to miss oil and one grass like that in the village
8487 2018-07-07 19:09:01 My Patagonia shirt got an oil stain on it but ima still wear it 
8488 2018-07-07 19:08:53 Why are we not using our reserves to flood the market? We always hear boasting of how much oil and gas we have. Whatever happened to energy independence?
I'm a Trump Supporter but my questions are legitimate @realDonaldTrump
8489 2018-07-07 19:08:47 It's a very interesting time to be alive, because the cogs in the machine that make the world's leading money making businesses progress (war, weapons & oil) are being exposed as contrived, deceptive & very fake. It's getting so sloppy it's ridiculous, and they don't seem to care
8490 2018-07-07 19:08:45 Cleaned my car. Got the oil changed and tires rotated. One week till vacation. I can't freaking wait.

8497 2018-07-07 19:07:47 give trade some teatree oil.
8498 2018-07-07 19:07:37 Whatever the technique, US was better able to access US-located sources, formerly unreachable. During Obama's tenure. Has nothing to do with regulations. Canadian oil less accessible, so big oil went for more easily accessible sources. Economics.

8501 2018-07-07 19:07:17 Truth, Trump? He's a cheap snake oil salesman, con artist that consistently contradicts himself and you know it.
8502 2018-07-07 19:07:14 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
8503 2018-07-07 19:07:03 do you believe there is an infinite amount of oil?

8506 2018-07-07 19:06:05 We haven't gotten there yet.  Venezuela was too heavily invested in oil proceeds, and when Obama encouraged US domestic production, he tanked the price of oil around the world, thus leaving Venezuela and several other producer countries in bad shape.
8507 2018-07-07 19:05:52 It's a great city if you enjoy sitting in traffic for 3hrs to go 1/2 mile
8508 2018-07-07 19:05:40 They're doping. A story came out about it. Fifa doesn't care. Still they should be ousted today.
8509 2018-07-07 19:05:31 Those big companies also knew their products were harmful and actively suppressed their own studies that showed they were. If dumb Repub voters are dumb enough to believe rich people who made their $$$ in oil that it is harmless to the planet, then let them die in ignorance 2/2

8518 2018-07-07 19:03:48 but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom was delayed, they all lingered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out now to meet him.’ Then all those virgins arose, and made ready their lamps.

8521 2018-07-07 19:02:41 Coal is on the decline worldwide so why invest in a dying industry? There are more US workers in solar than coal, gas & oil COMBINED. But Conservatives want to cling to the last rather than move forward. Kevin sounds like a bot. Who cares what he thinks.

8525 2018-07-07 19:02:19 Germany has traditionally a very good relationship to Arabs. Our Emperor Wilhelm II INVENTED their "holy war" (in the hope it motivates them to drive the Brits from the oil fields). But shouldn't our politicians first of all protect our society?

8532 2018-07-07 19:01:57 Cottonseed oil is not edible.  Humans can't eat it.  Consumption causes vomiting, diarrhea, hives/blisters, joint pain, and headaches and even death for those allergic.  Corporations push it on consumers because it is basically a free, industrial by product.

8540 2018-07-07 19:00:26 I get what you’re saying. In the Mid East can we agree that the wars going on are for control of oil by large oil companies? And for profits? If so then it’s the capitalists are initiating these wars and like you said, not capitalism directly.

8545 2018-07-07 18:59:51 I would imagine an oil such as olive oil may loosen it up.
8546 2018-07-07 18:59:47 He thinks he can give his presidential orders to the demand and supply in the oil market. If the price of oil goes up and remains high for a while we may witness another financial crisis as the current level of household debt and public debt are very high.
8547 2018-07-07 18:59:44 I don't think that there are any furanocoumarins in the essential oil. It is mostly limonene.
"The main chemical components are a-pinene, sabinene, myrcene, limonene, geraniol, linalool, citronellal, decyl acetate, neryl acetate and terpinen-4-ol"
Harmless really.

8549 2018-07-07 18:59:34 I wonder how much of a military presence we would have there if not for the oil. I mean 19 Saudi Arabians attacked America and we then attacked Iraq and Afghanistan. What’s up Doc?
8550 2018-07-07 18:59:21 It's like perming your eyelashes! So it takes about an hour for lifting and tinting. I'll put a perming solution, a setting solution, an oil to restore the lashes and then tinting them black!
8551 2018-07-07 18:59:05 The world cannot consume all of its oil, gas, and coal reserves without catastrophic climate consequences. To limit the increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius more than two-thirds of current known reserves, must remain in the ground.

8555 2018-07-07 18:58:39  I don't know how to control myself anyway. I had too much peanut butter cup and sauteed some veggies in olive oil yesterday. Slept from 5 pm to 9:30 am. 
8556 2018-07-07 18:58:15 Venezuela's economy was radically mishandled, BUT in the near term the majority of its problems come down to "insufficiently diversified petro economy when oil prices fall too much."

Let me give you a heads up. Same thing will happen to Saudi Arabia in 10 to 20 at the outside.
8557 2018-07-07 18:58:14 But then we had the oil crisis, the stagflation and this massively impacted the EEC plans for European Union established in 1972 on the understanding we would have it by 1980. Instead the European Union got pushed back, and the monetary union pushed back even further.

8559 2018-07-07 18:58:02 and HH prices are expected to remain low & range bound as long as the Oil/Gas price ratio is high. a ratio above 25 is very bullish for US LNG
- Higher oil prices brings a at of associated gas: dumped at any price
- Higher oil prices encourage wet gas drilling, dry gas is dumped

8564 2018-07-07 18:57:07 Are you saying that they're no women who like to get their hands dirty and change their own oil?
8565 2018-07-07 18:56:57 The Shah of Iran. WE propped him up because he was more willing to sell us cheap oil. That’s just straight up FACT, John.
8566 2018-07-07 18:56:55 The world cannot consume all of its oil, gas, and coal reserves without catastrophic climate consequences. To limit the increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius more than two-thirds of current known reserves, must remain in the ground.
8567 2018-07-07 18:56:51 Oil companies need to be regulated. They need to be responsible. And, trust me, they can afford it.

8573 2018-07-07 18:55:43 Cottonseed oil is poison.
8574 2018-07-07 18:55:25 Cottonseed oil causes vomiting, diarrhea, hives/blisters, joint pain, migraine and in extreme cases even death.  Humans can't and do not eat cotton plants, so why would anyone think the oil from a cottonseed plant is edible?  Corporations use it because it's a cheap byproduct.
8575 2018-07-07 18:55:25 How does Sipho or anyone else feature on the price increase of petrol? Is petrol no longer an internationally traded commodity where SA is only a price taker? Even Mandela could have done nothing about escalation of crude oil prices

8580 2018-07-07 18:54:35 Or MAYBE... reduce our dependence on foreign oil so their prices become irrelevant. That would be like @Maga or America First. That would also be like actually doing something rather than simply ranting with empty rhetoric. Can't have that, can we?
8581 2018-07-07 18:54:00 I’ve been told by strong people that gloves aren’t good for lifting. Calluses are just what happens. For joints I take fish oil, surprisingly helped me a ton
8582 2018-07-07 18:53:57 It is going too far, isn't it ? Without talking about revolution, why there's not 25 millions Americans on Pennsylvania Ave. ??? In any other country there's justified manifestations for the increase in the price of oil or milk. But here we are talking about humanity !!!!!!!!!!!

8585 2018-07-07 18:53:41 Tesla is doing amazing things to develop technology that will free us from oil dependence. However “48 states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.” The liberals are calling for regulations that hurt progress in the private sector

8595 2018-07-07 18:51:34 Oil would have benifited all of us. It was way more sinister than that. It was to boost the private war & security firms that key govt leaders were invested in.

8606 2018-07-07 18:49:16 Of course, our economy is affected when you steal our oil, our petroleum from the islands (sorry, I made a mistake, because petrol is gasolina, and oil is Petróleo... that's what I meant)
8607 2018-07-07 18:49:14 Well, not quite..... Kim Jong Un has still NOT met a “legitimate” American president. He did (however) meet with a real estate agent, snake oil salesman, con artist, and a disturbed narcissist. So, the USA is still on the side with the angels.

8612 2018-07-07 18:48:37 Oil prices fell yesterday: Yesterday, EUR/USD profited from the debate/rumors that the ECB kept the door open for a September 2019 rate hike, earlier than what the market ...

8615 2018-07-07 18:48:30 ...which is good considering the higher prices we’re all paying due to increasing oil prices (much higher than Obama), tariffs and Trump’s trade wars.
8616 2018-07-07 18:48:13 Too deep US will never find oil here

8634 2018-07-07 18:45:39 The oil example in the article is backwards. 5W-30 is “thinner/more efficient” than 10W-30.
8635 2018-07-07 18:45:35 @drunkenwood Dave I really like your new office desktop and it fits perfectly for my next project. I want to copy your material ideas but my only concern is if the walnut plywood can last? Is linseed oil enough protection? Have you ever used resin on plywood?

8650 2018-07-07 18:43:27 i tried coconut oil for my skin and BOY my shit broke out sooooo bad. come to find out it’s rated fairly high as a comedogenic.
8651 2018-07-07 18:43:23 In basic ideology I agree with you but I’m also realistic. NY is a melting pot & we’re largely a more progressive state. In Texas guns, Christianity, oil & Republicans rule. Sometimes it takes baby steps to effect change.

8654 2018-07-07 18:42:48 A jet engine pump like the one they used in Baghdad on the oil wills.
8655 2018-07-07 18:42:44 The sticky side of a tape can be used to pull the residue off the surface of a product. 4. Treat the area with mineral oil. After a few moments, wipe away the oil using a clean cloth. If the sticker residue is still present, use a pencil eraser to rub off remaining sticker

8678 2018-07-07 18:40:05 Are you SURE??? That looks like a file photo I've seen before. While others show photos of areas that are clearly desolate and have no wildlife, or even water ways. And I've seen those same pictures showing oil oozing from the ground! Be sure before you assume.
8679 2018-07-07 18:39:46 We should stop pumping fossil waters of the south to the north.
This is a crime towards the people of the south.
Use the oil to desalinate sea water, less head aches and more secure.

8697 2018-07-07 18:37:33 Dirty bastards are also into teabagging. And not just for pride, but every day of the year. We have to keep the children away from the tea bags... As long as they drink nothing but virgin olive oil, they'll be fine.
8698 2018-07-07 18:37:25 Help me understand how a nation with so much potential for #WindFarm #SolarEnergy #WavePower #GeothermalEnergy #HydroEnergy is clinging on the price of #oil... #Haiti #Ayiti #KeepItHaitian #KeepingItHaitian #Haitian #CaptainHaiti
8699 2018-07-07 18:37:06 How about d solution to millitacy/pipeline vandalism being giving d oil back to d host state/community

Will d FG ever consider this as a solution in an area they ve mismanaged since independent

Cattle raring is a private biz
8700 2018-07-07 18:36:48 You try using tea tree oil ?

8702 2018-07-07 18:36:38 Zinke is human garbage and a whore for Oil, Gas, Coal and Mining. He doesn’t give a shit about protecting public lands.
8703 2018-07-07 18:36:35 Looking at a one year spread is misleading. 2014 pre-recession 313B, 2016 is 290B & now back up to 305B in 2017. Of course the increase is impressive given how far it had fallen. 2015-16 -3.7% & 2016-17 4.9%. Positive sign sure but not the whole story and correlates to oil prices

8707 2018-07-07 18:36:03 Documentation is the castor oil of programming. Managers know it must be good because the programmers hate it so much. #fortune
8708 2018-07-07 18:36:00 Actually...I find you all so vacuous in this game you play..."I am sooo powerful in #business." Really, darlings? So sordid of you! Let's fix the #market! We all pay way too much for #diamonds and #oil.
8709 2018-07-07 18:35:54 Just put coconut oil on my dogs paws and he's walking funny trying to lick it
8710 2018-07-07 18:35:52 I'm sorry but this Russia run at #WorldCup is now beyond the point of absurdity. Didn't buy from the outburst in the opener and still don't...something smells

8712 2018-07-07 18:35:43 Over time it will also turn slightly brownish if you put oil on it
8713 2018-07-07 18:35:37 Obviously without examining him, I can’t offer much. CBD oil in children has been a wonder for seizures, it’s only now being tried in animals. You may want to buy a Guardzilla home security cam, about 75.00 then you can monitor when not home it sends motion alerts
8714 2018-07-07 18:35:33 A foaming facial mask, light white, with coconut oil, peacock oil, and exfoliating amber dust. It comes as a liquid in a beautiful bottle.
8715 2018-07-07 18:35:27 Hey Hey! Sorry this is late. I make a DIY one. I mix glycerine, Organics conditioner and water. Then I seal with Shea butter or castor oil (chemist ones work just as good as the expensive ones). Makes my hair feel really moisturised. Good luck!
8716 2018-07-07 18:35:21 Bih aint no makeup no body butter no coconut oil almond oil NONE OF THAT TODAY
8717 2018-07-07 18:35:17 CBD oil helps also - but I get stupid.
8718 2018-07-07 18:35:11 Yes the tar sands variety not olive oil...
8719 2018-07-07 18:35:08 Now how will those who depend on kadogo economy ( Mavuta Apima) know safety of cooking oil they are purchasing.
8720 2018-07-07 18:35:04 Happy to have introduced you to something new! It was an oil barge that hit it.

8724 2018-07-07 18:34:32 Well no matter how much oil cash you have you can't buy a finish like that.
8725 2018-07-07 18:34:22 Ok,when should I be expecting my salary from you?
8726 2018-07-07 18:34:20 As it is explained above oil was exported from KRG, which is not an offical county, though Turkish Republic port of Ceyhan. To emphasize a land belongs Turkey and there is no official kurdistan existing is not racism, It is the fact.
8727 2018-07-07 18:34:19 okay I get it. Republican senators went to Russia on behalf of US oil companies. Now it all makes sense.

8732 2018-07-07 18:33:57 What about medecinal marijuana not cbd oil .where are the dispensaries.
8733 2018-07-07 18:33:51 Last I saw, BEVs still needed economic incentives, but go ahead, make an oil company argument. We need to make sure that all these zero emission technologies make it. The Air Resources Board and local air agencies all agree that we can’t meet air quality standards w/o them.

8735 2018-07-07 18:33:17 Does a olive oil and lemon juice and black forest ham sandwich sound good?
8736 2018-07-07 18:33:07 They approach it all wrong. The Old testament and the Holy oil of Christ. The Holy oil is made from 5 ingredients one of which is cannabis buds.
8737 2018-07-07 18:32:58 My point is the dictators at least make the oil companies pay their fair share. The opposite happens in the US. Why? BC corporations run america, not the people.
8738 2018-07-07 18:32:37 Do wot Rach did when I said "don't have the baby this wk end I'm knackered"
Took castor oil,the rest is history
8739 2018-07-07 18:32:22 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
8740 2018-07-07 18:32:05 Judges were looking for 'Lose with dignity?', but will award partial credit for this reply.
8741 2018-07-07 18:32:03 I made cookies , brownies, Rice Krispies treats, and pretty much anything else that you would use butter or oil in. It’s a whole different kind of high.
8742 2018-07-07 18:31:54 Pipeline hasnt been built yet. But yes, we sell our oil to you at a 20 percent discount and then buy it back at a 50 mark up and a 30% exchange rate on the dollar. Make fucking sense hey? 5.20 a gallon today. And the govt taxes the shit out it too. Brilliant. 
8743 2018-07-07 18:31:47 Esta bueno para la previa Fuel oil
8744 2018-07-07 18:31:41 Well i hope someone cleaned up the oil slick after they got out of the pool.

8747 2018-07-07 18:31:39 They are normally £150 once fully finished. I don't have any oil with me but I can flick over it with the blow torch and leave it with someone in the BBC tent if that helps? You can paint some oil on it yourself 
8748 2018-07-07 18:31:37 My “healthy” KFC recipe.
Oven @ 200c 

Use boneless chicken thighs

Make rub, equal parts garlic salt, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper. Half part black pepper.

Rub oil over chicken, then rub the rub all over chicken

Bake for 30 mins.

Tastes just like original recipe KFC

8750 2018-07-07 18:31:24 Not black/white, works great in Norway. Dictatorial regimes at least get ridiculously rich, in America we subsidize all of those dictators by subsidizing the oil industry. If Nigerian gov gets a 60% cut of all oil profits and American gov pays oil companies something is not right
8751 2018-07-07 18:31:21 We go broke because of our people. 
Low to non-existent business ethics and trade morals 
They are so entitled to our money 
All to appease they world. As if they can sit in a oil or gas price deciding meeting
8752 2018-07-07 18:31:19 Was an evidentiary issue. Gotta get those masks off for adequate identification.
8753 2018-07-07 18:31:15 Nope clearly whipped cream. I don't eat regular candy bars anymore. They are all full of palm oil and it is the Devil's grease. My chocolate has to be fair trade, vegan, kosher, ethically grown, and no GMO. 70%-72% cocoa fats.

8767 2018-07-07 18:29:20 You were being equally vicious to stranger as a matter of fact. And I actually did ask how this was misogynistic. I am still all ears! And I’d call this intellectual courage, it’s an epistemic virtue. Look it up maybe?

8771 2018-07-07 18:28:39 Are the puzzles now fitting? The offensive exploitation of oil and gas deposits in the destruction of the environment will provide unlimited cash for them. Perhaps the people can survive in a poisoned environment, but who cares such "side costs of operation"? At the same time,yo
8772 2018-07-07 18:28:37 Flavored olive oils have changed salads for me forever. I used to hate salad dressings, mostly because of the vinegar. I decided to skip the vinegar and just try roasted garlic infused olive oil with a sprinkle of salt on top of a salad and it was DELICIOUS
8773 2018-07-07 18:28:34 Oil and politics go hand in hand. When the price dropped down, crisis were all over the world. Oil price should bring stability to the world and shouldn't follow what people or companies from certain countries want

8775 2018-07-07 18:28:17 The interim government reduced the petroleum prices on Saturday after two times increment in last month.
The new price of petrol will be Rs95.24 per liter, light diesel Rs75.37 per liter and carnosine oil Rs83.96 per liter.
8776 2018-07-07 18:28:03 There is no common sense here. We are talking about spending billions, risking a 14B$/yr coastal economy to another oil spill, pouring carbon into our bubble of an atmosphere, and making an oil company rich to give raw resources to China
8777 2018-07-07 18:27:49 Saw an interesting post yesterday about the fact that the 6 who visited Moscow are from oil industry states.
Maybe not blackmail but a bribe?

8779 2018-07-07 18:27:12 AIDS can be cured by the Extreme oil and the Holy oil of Christ. There was more than one reason that the illuminati made cannabis illegal.
8780 2018-07-07 18:26:50 My mom would make tacos and soften them in oil, then bake them. They were the best. The ONLY way I’ll eat corn tortillas.

Sleep with coconut oil on your face 

A lot of the stuff we do for acne dries out our whole face and the. We try to produce more oil so our skin isn't sandpaper but then the acne lives. use lotion after a toner

8792 2018-07-07 18:25:34 The idea is you win things, the success bring you financial rewards and you use that to buy big. United, Spurs, Liverpool, Barca & Real have earned that sucsess over decades, not bought it with Arab oil money, there is a huge difference.

India poised to be of pivotal interest for American #Oil producers due to #TradeWar between #USA & #China. Refiners in China were the top buyers of American crude oil in May but sales bound to slow now. India being wooed -- a happy position which it should milk.

8815 2018-07-07 18:22:40 Correct. We overthrew a democratically elected government because they were going to nationalize oil. Our corporations could not have that.
8816 2018-07-07 18:22:21 Good question Mr. Weaver.  My question is how much do OPEC kings and oligarchs spend on their weapons to kill and oppress?  The world needs a strong  and our democratic Oil!

If you intend on spreading lies through twitter, I'll just make a suggestion to your readers to bypass you and instead watch FoxNews.
8837 2018-07-07 18:19:02 Isn't it true that we should focus on cutting our *demand* for fossil fuels, using carbon pricing, rather than trying to withhold *supply*? Global emissions won't fall if we block Cdn oil exports - importing countries will buy oil elsewhere, and price won't rise because of OPEC.
8838 2018-07-07 18:18:58 I swear these people put half a bottle of oil in this curry!!!! Issa lot
8839 2018-07-07 18:18:58 @hickforco is a geologist and has worked in the oil and gas industry. Hickenlooper 2020, the President we deserve.

8844 2018-07-07 18:18:03 And that's what we call *field corn*, all you city-folk. (Not sweet corn like in your grocery store.) Can't eat it... but it's processed to make your corn oil, corn syrup, corn chips, etc.... Oh, and the ethanol in your gasoline. #AmericanFarmers
8845 2018-07-07 18:17:58 Hot oil is supposed to go in the pan and not your face. Room temperature oil however can be used on your face to remove makeup xoxoxo

8849 2018-07-07 18:17:12 As an oceanographer, all I can think about is, all the pollution in the oceans, all the plastic, the depleting fish stocks, the bleaching corals, CO2 mixing with H2O to make carbonic acid reducing the pH, the oil spills and all the other insults humans have brought.
8850 2018-07-07 18:17:08 Maybe because we paid for it when Obama sent pallets of cash to Iran.  You think oil is free?

Cars are not the only source of risk to cyclists and fatalities are vastly outnumbered by serious injuries.

8867 2018-07-07 18:14:37 when our bun was sick the bet told us they put rose oil in a lot of rabbit medication because they love the taste of it and it made me so happy
8868 2018-07-07 18:14:25 EV cars, vans, trucks, elec trains no problem; ships will gradually switch to biofuels & hydrogen from renewables; planes probably biofuels, maybe short-range planes will go electric. Buildings solar/wind/geothermal/battery. High oil/gas price will spur these exciting changes
8869 2018-07-07 18:14:18 I WAS WONDERING WHY THIS NOODLES DIDN'T TASTE LIKE IT USED TO BUT HALFWAY THROUGH EATING IT I REALIZED I FORGOT TO OPEN THE OIL PACKET

8872 2018-07-07 18:13:56 Is there anywhere that someone should wear patchouli oil?
8873 2018-07-07 18:13:53 Factor 6 tanning oil really wasn’t a good idea considering how pale I am. Like a wee tomato 
8874 2018-07-07 18:13:38 I took my car to an impromptu oil change place and they all start screaming “STANDARD. WE GOT A STANDARD. PREPARE FOR ROLL BACK. READY?” And there’s 6 guys doing my oil change because they aren’t used to Fiats lmao
8875 2018-07-07 18:13:24 Speaking of full of shit; guy who worked for big oil and guy who works for an organization funded by big oil, neither of which have any background in science. I’ve said it before, you’re either lying or dumb.

8883 2018-07-07 18:12:02 Are vegans allowed to use oil and gasoline? I don't think they should be. Also, no retaliation against bedbugs and other infestations, or the fleas on their dogs. And if they catch crabs, they better nurture them.
8884 2018-07-07 18:11:54 Yes, and that would have had nothing to do with an oil recession that the NDP didn't cause, would it have?

Fact is, after 45 years of PC rule, this province was so ill-prepared for a small oil recession it's embarrassing. That's on the Conservatives, NOT the NDP.

8888 2018-07-07 18:11:29 Does this perspective undercut others?: "wood fuel accounts for as much of the world’s renewable energy supply as solar, hydroelectric & wind power, & #forests contain the equivalent of 142 billion tons of oil – roughly 10 times the annual global primary energy consumption." 1/
8889 2018-07-07 18:11:20 @SethMacFarlane the sheer ignorance of people is what is horrifying. It is easier for them to believe to snake oil salesman and his bunch of blaggards than look around, read and think for themselves.

8904 2018-07-07 18:09:58 Good luck on the puts. Short squeeze will make them worthless for a while, regardless of strike price. Per @S3Partners shares borrowed and sold short are worth close to $11 billion, soon to triple. There is only so much tax subsidy the oil industry can divert into backing that

8934 2018-07-07 18:07:47 You know we could just call it olive oil. You don't have to shame it with the "extra virgin" label. We already know olives don't fuck nor does anyone reasonably expect them to.
8935 2018-07-07 18:07:42 I think oil has been phased out to some extent here. It's common in my grandfather's neighborhood, but mostly gas here.

8952 2018-07-07 18:05:13 CO², with understanding few positive roles in our atmosphere, is generally a pollutant. To imply otherwise is merely a play in semantics. 

CO² also plays a role in oceanic acidification from the absorption of CO² in the atmosphere and falling into our oceans through rain water.

8965 2018-07-07 18:03:34 I would use latex instead of oil, just for easier clean up. Water soluble so makes things easier. Other than that you can pretty much pick your color/finish/brand.

8981 2018-07-07 18:01:51 I'm not a scholar, but I don't think ancient Egyptians were burning 1,428 billion gallons of oil every year so it may not be a perfect apples-to-apples comparison.
8982 2018-07-07 18:01:49 Come to New York instead. Honestly better city.
8983 2018-07-07 18:01:42 Or use a cheese grater & grate up fresh potatoes & shape them like a pancake fry them in a lil bit of oil

8985 2018-07-07 18:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and powerful politicians.
8986 2018-07-07 18:01:01 I’m looking forward to the day when republican money comes from renewable energy companies rather than oil. Maybe then they will get serious about solutions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

8993 2018-07-07 17:59:51 I gotta get an oil change before work today...#ugh
8994 2018-07-07 17:59:48 I had a dream some girl was coming over cus she wanted to try my homemade aloe vera & tea tree oil face mask, but then when I was considering using store bought aloe gel instead of cutting my aloe plant to extract gel she said nvm. & I was like no no nvm I’ll cut the aloe for u!

9000 2018-07-07 17:58:51 At the dealership gettin a standard oil change. They come back and tell me i have $5000 worth of work needed. Sincerely wondering how much work i would need if my dad came with me 
9001 2018-07-07 17:58:44 I don't know what the temperature is in Oakland, but I know it's hot because the coconut oil is liquefying.
9002 2018-07-07 17:58:44 Ha #pointsoflight what a joke. Corrupt & greedy #potus @GeorgeHWBush said "hes happy" oh yeah AFTER u got presidency & AFTER ur oil swindles

9004 2018-07-07 17:58:32 Cocunut oil help with so much
9005 2018-07-07 17:58:28 Yet you allow Sunoco to come in and wrecklessly and willfully destroy my middle class community, putting the profits of oil & gas industry above the safety of Pennsylvanians, including our right to clean air and water for future generations.
9006 2018-07-07 17:58:04 This “Chinese SDR-gold peg” is the new “gold-backed-oil-yuan futures contract”. A myth.
9007 2018-07-07 17:57:57 I hope I have cleared myself. I raise this issue w/ anyone who uses the words boy or girl for young men & women. No one should refer to people over 19 as girls or boys. I believe growing old is natural, and a wonderful phenomenon. I just have an issue w/ larka/larki obsession

9009 2018-07-07 17:57:45 Then the EIA states: "However, regardless of the ultimate mode of transport, most of Russia’s crude oil exports must traverse Transneft’s pipeline system, either as a direct route to reach bordering countries or to reach Russian ports."
9010 2018-07-07 17:57:40 These ppl voted for Obama and Rahm. They keep voting corrupt politicians. Sounds like Einstein's definition of insanity
9011 2018-07-07 17:57:32 I remember 2 years ago today when I  was homeless my boy asked me if he could borrow my car while I finally got to sleep on a bed.. he came back with the car clean, full tank of gas and oil change.. now I’m his daughters god father. Bless my circle
9012 2018-07-07 17:57:27 Some metal lyrics this morning:
Give us reason for the coming of war
Fighting for Jesus through prices of oil
See how your demons are forming a wall
Burning, beating, and raping them all
9013 2018-07-07 17:57:20 i predict the weather using coconut oil
9014 2018-07-07 17:57:08 No, the deal is alive and well. Iran is still earning billions through their sales of crude oil. And China will do everything to keep this going. Sorry, mate :-)

9018 2018-07-07 17:56:55 So a #croatian  oil man came to Cork late 70s to work the oilfields. Charmer from Zagreb. Auntie was teller in Citibank on the South Mall. They fell in love across the counter and married - now two kids in Texas. They’ve got my shout tonight #rusvcro #worldcup

9022 2018-07-07 17:56:29 We’ll see how his term affects all before judging just like Obama’s term. How’d his term go for the oil field ? Many jobs lost.
9023 2018-07-07 17:56:12 True! So to that I say:
1. Fresh clean house
2. Lilacs in the wild
3. Old school sun oil
4. Pipe tobacco 
5. The inside of an old church

9026 2018-07-07 17:55:54 I am liberal on some matters as well such as energy issues (coal and oil need to go away - focus on nuclear), I agree with right to die/euthanasia, I support legalization of weed.

9028 2018-07-07 17:55:45 Jeremy and a strong delegation of real @UKLabour party peace makers should attend England’s semifinal match in Moscow. Time to lance the Blairite ZioCon continuous war boil. We should be campaigning against the build up to war in Iran. Not for bombing Syria for Israel & Oil

9039 2018-07-07 17:54:24 My update on junk email intended for 60 year old casino goers is lots of ads for cannabis oil for joint pain, hip replacement quotes and double the amount of life insurance ads. Asian dating is still regular but less 50+ dating sites.
9040 2018-07-07 17:54:09 @Oil_Guns_Merica I don’t care what someone’s position is, but when you do things like this I no longer will support you if I agree with your stance. In this case it was a no from the get go.

9049 2018-07-07 17:52:59 Di talaga nakakahelp si neutro magbawas ng oil (based sa dalawang nagamit ko). Pang deep cleanse lang sya. Pero helpful pa din cos linis talaga si fez. Just avoid using cleansers na may beads. Mas nakakatagyawat yun kasi napasok si beads sa pores. Huhu.

9056 2018-07-07 17:52:05 Hey Chris what was Trump talking about Germany buying oil from RUSSIA?
9057 2018-07-07 17:51:21 Well oil is always changing regardless of who is in charge. I can not attest to the other two because I haven’t truly taken the time to look into them, but yeah he should definitely not ever be allowed to be in the public eye or to say/tweet a word.

Trump will do anything Putin asks to get his share.

Putin will do anything he can to help Trump lift those sanctions, including offering visiting Republicans a piece of the action upon the lifting of those sanctions.
9068 2018-07-07 17:49:57 idk what it is about going down the shore - any other day I legit build a second layer of skin with sunscreen, but the minute I step on the beach I’m dowsing myself with olive oil 
9069 2018-07-07 17:49:53 Lol, that simply shows how wonderfully liberal you are. Instead of asking me you've to be vicious, so enlightened of you.
I've NO desire to make sense to a person who's so nasty about a stranger. Your "intellectual arrogance" is laughable, whoever you are. Stop reading my tweets
9070 2018-07-07 17:49:27 Soo fucking annoying when corporatists try  to coopt our movements.Especially with this guy who was a big monied interest, and worked/works for the oil industry,while having a green-energy company at the same time,serving as a front,49th dems should have voted for doug appellate
9071 2018-07-07 17:49:22 Came in for an oil change, might be leaving with a new car. Why do I do these things?!
9072 2018-07-07 17:49:13 Turks, most likely, unless they're captures. Turks have been allied with, or at least funding, most - if not all - Islamist groups in Syria. Erdogan was also the guy who bought most of Daesh' oil, so there's that.

9074 2018-07-07 17:48:51 Yes, Trump's not conjuring this up on his own. He's delivering wishlists of the Kochs, CNP, Big Oil, China, Ru, Saudi, global far right, etc. My guess is: He targets "lobster" to kill 2 birds with 1 stone: to hurt "NE liberal middle-class businesses" & % of lobster goes to China?
9075 2018-07-07 17:48:49 Yet, al shabaab are funded by oil money....

9080 2018-07-07 17:46:53 I enjoy mixing some mozzarella with basil and tomato and olive oil and having a little caprese picnic. It’s much cheaper and I did it myself!
9081 2018-07-07 17:46:50 That feeling when you get your oil changed and your car washed 
9082 2018-07-07 17:46:50 You won't.
9083 2018-07-07 17:46:37 Scott Pruitt said he resigned to spend more time with the money the oil companies gave him.
9084 2018-07-07 17:46:32 In addition, these oil companies consist of a work force that are scientifically literate. Until engineers/scientists muster the courage to find jobs in other industries, we are not just fighting the executives but also their employees.
9085 2018-07-07 17:46:25 My car annoying...asking for an oil change when I could use that money for food
9086 2018-07-07 17:46:25 This oil change got me irritated.
9087 2018-07-07 17:46:23 Oil is still essentially, for everyone. About 144 products are made with #oil. Plastic, for example. Is there any way to manufacture #plastic without #petroleum?
9088 2018-07-07 17:46:22 Next shape-coal/oil industry lobbyist. 
So not much of a shift.
9089 2018-07-07 17:46:18 The only Saturday dishes in my household that are acceptable (other than soup) are brown down or oil down.
9090 2018-07-07 17:46:17 Classic: you take your car to a simple oil change to the service center, and the mechanic came to you whit a list of a lot of part what you need to change. But the cars is new and runs great.
9091 2018-07-07 17:45:58 With out taking sides, how did U say Karnataka ppl accepted  hike just bcoz it's for farmers and what central guvt hiked is Anti farmer,? Centre increased it due to Intl oil prices hike and here it's to keep up it's political goal.Time will tell whats hidden.

9093 2018-07-07 17:45:51 Good night friend doctor atanas I love eat olive oil because olive oil is healthy food
9094 2018-07-07 17:45:41 Good point! Exactly why its about time to move past oil, coal and gas to renewable energy. The damages to America is another matter but can be partially resolved to via voting! . o O ( #protip )
9095 2018-07-07 17:45:33 Check your Engine oil this morning.
9096 2018-07-07 17:45:29 I’m the worst at remembering to get my oil changed 
9097 2018-07-07 17:45:21 “I never have time to get my oil changed” is what I tell myself over and over again as I sit in my bed watching TV
9098 2018-07-07 17:45:11 Oil change on the car done, was supposed to do it about 600 miles ago as breaking-in service for the replacement engine ^^;
Put the expensive oil in though! IM GOOD SOMETIMES.
9099 2018-07-07 17:45:10 Bokap gw sampe nanya "itu muka kamu kenapa?" Nangis :((( gw baru semingguan sih pakenya dan kalopun jerawat pada muncul tapi kulit gw jadi lebih dewy, nggak kusem gitu makanya gw putusin buat lanjut pake.

Facial oil tuh kek gimana, Mik? Berarti sering pake sheet mask jga bisa ya
9100 2018-07-07 17:45:10 #DYK - #Alberta isn't home to just private multinational energy companies - @CoopAlberta members @CoopFCL have owned oil refineries for more than 80 years with a long tradition of serving #farmers and rural areas

#CoopsDay #TCCB #TakingCareofCoopBusiness
9101 2018-07-07 17:45:10 Way I see the whole Iran sanctions, very little oil of any, comes off the market.  China will buy what Europe doesn't at a steep discount.  And since Rosneft has a stake in a big Indian refinery, they do an oil swap and get it into India that way.
9102 2018-07-07 17:45:04 Ingredient Watch: Eating mayonnaise this July? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
9103 2018-07-07 17:45:01 A fella I know has one in same condition, gets ridden everywhere, throws more oil than anything I've ever seen and he's always smiling when on it 
9104 2018-07-07 17:44:49 it’s so bad lol

“What type of oil would you like sir?”

me: uhh does it make a big difference?

“Yes it does”

me: uhh I’ll take the cheapest one please

9107 2018-07-07 17:44:42 The EPA is an acronym for the Environmental Protection Agency. Those at that federal government agency are responsible to help ensure they're doing what they can to help make drinking water safe, our air breathable, while cutting back on our carbon footprint.

9109 2018-07-07 17:44:30 Not unless my son leaves it sitting with water in it overnight. Then I just heat it up, rub it with a little olive oil, let it sit, then wipe it out. Bob’s your uncle, nonstick again.
9110 2018-07-07 17:44:29 How they put the wrong oil in my shit n tell me days later
9111 2018-07-07 17:44:25 Eniwei, gue abis cek sabunnya alamzempol, beberapa masi pake palm oil cuy.. 
9112 2018-07-07 17:43:46 Likely going to happen. Russian market will rally hard work easing tensions, high oil price and it's very very cheap.
9113 2018-07-07 17:43:29 yass it’s the best and with coconut oil as a moisturizer skin is gonna flourish
9114 2018-07-07 17:43:27 Also 30 years since the worst oil rig disaster, Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea went on fire killing 167 men. Very sad. Mx

Every night I dream about chasing an old car and wake up overly exhausted from it.

I'm guessing the car needed an oil change or had an exhaust leak or something like that. I don't know much about cars.

9120 2018-07-07 17:42:07 Emissions controls on diesel trucks decreases the fuel efficiency of the vehicles by 25-30%.  So they use more oil pumped out of the ground.  Actual difference in emissions is negligible.  Coming from a diesel mechanic.  It also makes the truck less reliable and cost more.
9121 2018-07-07 17:42:06 My bow leg..... But mumsy use cod liver oil wan kee me
9122 2018-07-07 17:41:58 Causing the departure of University Professors, Technicians, Master Teachers, Highly trained workforce and our Youth. all exodus of qualified people who lose Venezuela and obtain another country. As at the time the oil exodus where to name some beneficiaries. Like Colombia Mexico
9123 2018-07-07 17:41:54 Looks like a care on fire. Oil burning.
9124 2018-07-07 17:41:37 Recently, @Pontifex invited oil executives and investors to the Vatican for a closed-door conference where he urged them to find alternatives to fossil fuels. He warned climate change was a challenge of “epochal proportions”.
9125 2018-07-07 17:41:33 I'm sure DJT had a cordial mtg w/KJU. But DJT is incapable of seeing past himself. His reality is only how it relates to him. Those believing he will save them from their ills have gladly bathed in the snake oil & willingly consumed the koolaid.

9126 2018-07-07 17:41:25 It’s absolutely excellent. I enjoy it with a pesto, tomato sauce and infused olive oil!
9127 2018-07-07 17:41:23 Well said!  The fact is that over 70% of Americans believe climate change is happening.  It’s a matter of igniting change and building a cleaner future.  It would be more feasible if the issue wasn’t blocked by big oil money in the pockets of politicians (..Trump).
9128 2018-07-07 17:41:23 So, are you able to come and join me for the two semi-finals on the oil rig in the North Sea I am working on until Thursday, or shall we take a rain check until the Belgium v England final instead?! 
9129 2018-07-07 17:41:11 Who knew that the easiest way to get back into your mother's good books is to volunteer your head to be reacquainted with castor oil through her hands?
9130 2018-07-07 17:41:08 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
9131 2018-07-07 17:41:02 How do people without interests in the oil and gas industry actually convince themselves that climate change is a hoax? How decidedly stupid can you really be?
9132 2018-07-07 17:40:52 What if Obama had similarly ignored the BP oil disaster (or ebola, or well any crisis) and tried to pass the buck? And he did nothing to cause it! (Maybe a tired game, but useful for framing purposes.) #ImmigrantChildren #disaster #vacationmode cc: @JamesFallows @RonaldKlain

9134 2018-07-07 17:40:47 I’m now thinking that getting more tattoo work done wasn’t such a good idea after sunbathing for few hours with tanning oil.....
9135 2018-07-07 17:40:40 You know data is the new oil when Mukesh Ambani dedicates 40 minutes of the Reliance AGM  to talk Jio, Digital & industry
9136 2018-07-07 17:40:27 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
9137 2018-07-07 17:40:23 All he talked about was how Obama failed when this negotiation has never worked. Snake oil that this man is such a negotiator when much better people (anyone other than Dotard) have failed at this.

He is fueled by jealousy and rage, and that is LOSING!!!
9138 2018-07-07 17:40:19 Exactly. THAT is the silly and unnecessary innovation. Olive oil and garlic is the original and the best. Adding eggs to it is like adding coffee to beer.
9139 2018-07-07 17:40:17 Actually he did... No more AC freon and he did put a lot of regulations on big Oil and Gas and hello COAL... I can remember more but, Then again you would call it FAKE...
9140 2018-07-07 17:40:17 Not to mention his tariff tantrums are helping Putin collect hard currency for soy, corn and oil as the rest of the world turns to Russia for supply and zero tariff issues.  All part of the conman's plan and deal with Vlad.
9141 2018-07-07 17:40:17 And the foolish said to the prudent, ‘Give us of your oil. For our lamps have gone out.’ But the prudent answered, saying, ‘We may not give you because there will not be enough for both us and you. Go rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.’
9142 2018-07-07 17:40:06 We buy the olive oil mayo but I'm sure it's got chemicals to preserve it as well
9143 2018-07-07 17:40:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
9144 2018-07-07 17:40:03 Eastern Montana is an empty land of sagebrush prairies and hills. In most of the counties there were less people there in 2000 than in 1920. Oil might have changed that for some. Used to live there.
9145 2018-07-07 17:39:57 men... please fucking moisturize your dicks with your fav plant oil... I am tired of dusty dick pics...
9146 2018-07-07 17:39:52 Not sure. I think the last time he worked was at a fast food joint when he spat in someone’s burger.
9147 2018-07-07 17:39:48 Fave vegetable is asparagus. I can eat it for the rest of my life.  drizzled in olive oil, salt and pepper!
9148 2018-07-07 17:39:38 @willesonsports Edmonton has been used as a bad example, look at Nuck management structure, almost identical with similar results but the Oil had other issues to deal with. The team will suffer up to the CBA and expansion, if a stoppage standings may help in draft. 3 more top 5
9149 2018-07-07 17:39:10 Yeah but he was still cool. Suave and sophisticated, and actually his reasoning was quite legitimate. I mean, how many of his kind are left now? King Louie 100% would have torn him in half if he knew about palm oil.
9150 2018-07-07 17:38:55 Even with a broken global market, there'd still be some sort of global oil price outside the US (& Canada, Mexico?) affecting some US imports; good for Russia as you say & Venezuala, Nigeria, Angola +? But bad for Gulf, China, Japan, Korea, India, Phillipines, Europe, Turkey etc?
9151 2018-07-07 17:38:50 @marktcameron California freely allocates >10× more free CO2 quota to "thermal" oil producers (>GHG
GHG footprint than AB oilsands) than less GHG-intensive conventional oil producers. If AB, SK & NFLD&LAB adopt exact replicates of the California allowance supply & free ...2
9152 2018-07-07 17:38:35 Try being 55 & having gut reactions to 60’s tunes your ma thrashed when you were a kid.... radio is a minefield.

REM & Midnite Oil give me flashbacks to my own shenanigans!
9153 2018-07-07 17:38:31 I note the landing deck appears to be drenched in oil.... :)

Also I have just discovered that while CVN lifts look like great practice landing spots, they don't, for some reason, have collision physics....

9156 2018-07-07 17:38:18 Just brought my car in for an oil change and they informed me that my car did, in fact, eat the bunny I hit a few weeks ago 
9157 2018-07-07 17:38:16 To many lobbyist paying big $ to make real change. Hemp clothing, paper, building materials, hell even plastic bottles would change the world. We have been duped about oil [like diamonds] there are other ways

9159 2018-07-07 17:37:38 No, I mean, since he took office the stock market is at a record high, oil is coming back, and generally speaking, the economy is doing better than it has in a very long time. I just wish he would stop talking. 
9160 2018-07-07 17:37:38 Yep
9161 2018-07-07 17:37:35 I woke up this morning and my dad told me he got me a car wash, oil change and filled my gas tank. What did i do to deserve this man?????
9162 2018-07-07 17:37:32 If they don’t hurry up wih this oil change

9167 2018-07-07 17:36:48 The politicians in Utah are amazingly terrible--want to hand over their land to mining-drilling--welfare ranchers.  What do people visit Utah for? See oil-coal-cows? When will the New West show up?
9168 2018-07-07 17:36:45 The ooops remover works best but any oil based makeup remover should work.  Let it sit for a bit before wiping off with a warm washclo
9169 2018-07-07 17:36:41 @HDKumaraswamy1  Sir, you thanked yr officers from toiling hard for scripting d Budget by burning the midnight oil. It appears this s d reason Bellandur soap nut trees, Elevated/ Flyover ideas, Antargange schemes etc cropped up. Experts call all Idiotic Thots
9170 2018-07-07 17:36:36 Does he think Global Warming is like a Big Microwave out of control?  It takes a bit longer than your popcorn.  It is like a Big Wood and Oil Fired Oven takes a bit longer to heat up but when it Does.. It won't cool off.
9171 2018-07-07 17:36:29 Oil gente
9172 2018-07-07 17:36:20 Oil change cost damn near 100 now 
9173 2018-07-07 17:36:00 I figure olive oil and salt is gonna be a suitable replacement for the prosciutto, the umami is tricky tho! 
& extreme sympathy for the tmj disorder, I was starting to have tmj problems and managed to mostly cut it off w/ a nightguard but jfc, I was like “nobody warned me? Why?”
9174 2018-07-07 17:35:37 oh wait

what if I *am* the horse?

this might be an olive oil vs baby oil type situation...
9175 2018-07-07 17:35:07 It’s a 97 Honda Accord 195 k miles. Just did an oil change and new brakes.
9176 2018-07-07 17:35:02 I want oil biko. 
9177 2018-07-07 17:34:53 Does the label *expert* have any meaning when it comes to all these *snake oil* salesmen -women?

Kinda like considering a street hustler selling knock-off watches on 8th Avenue being an *expert* on Swiss watches.
9178 2018-07-07 17:34:49 Trade wars, rising oil prices, alienating allies,....sure, that's gonna help.
9179 2018-07-07 17:34:42 I add a little CDB oil in mine just for good measure.
9180 2018-07-07 17:34:25 Not in my family:

"Aioli or aïoli is a Mediterranean sauce made of garlic and olive oil; some regions use other emulsifiers such as eggs..."

Smells like novelty and unnecessary innovation.
9181 2018-07-07 17:34:03 The problem with Venezuela was over-reliance on Oil.  They might have tat same mistake in a capitalist system, but a socialist system it was much easier to make the mistake.
9182 2018-07-07 17:34:02 Mmmmmm, whipped oil. Just like mom used to make lmao

9185 2018-07-07 17:33:25 Now that Pruitt is out at the EPA don't be surprised if the next time you go to a Chick-fil-A, the salad is wilted, there's motor oil in the mashed potatoes, & the manager asks you to run out for lotion. #Pruitt
9186 2018-07-07 17:33:11 In Vegan oil?
9187 2018-07-07 17:32:44 Water and Oil don’t mix for a reason . One commands you to be baptized in his name

9190 2018-07-07 17:32:23 Shea butter mixed with almond oil on the affected area two times a day for about 6 months should do it.

9197 2018-07-07 17:31:57 Got my car cleaned in and out, an oil change, and tire rotation. I deserve a nap 
9198 2018-07-07 17:31:50 I love babysitting. It reminds me how little I know. Case in point- I just googled “can I pop popcorn in olive oil?” Good news is that there’s now a big pot of popcorn ready, popped in olive oil and tasting lovelt.

9206 2018-07-07 17:30:57 Yes, anything abrasive will work—steel wool, even a scrubbing sponge. Just don’t bother with chemical abrasives. Use hot water. Then liiightly oil all over and put in an oven upside down—should be so lightly oil that you won’t get any smoke at all. Might have to repeat.
9207 2018-07-07 17:30:44 Unite U Oil is a Argon oil that moisturizes and naturally protects the hair from heat. Great for summer in the pool or beach.
9208 2018-07-07 17:30:43 U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Flat but Oil Count Nudges Higher
9209 2018-07-07 17:30:40 Is gun oil good....never used any you called 
9210 2018-07-07 17:30:34 Oil burners are pipes for doing dabs or something?
9211 2018-07-07 17:30:27 When the oil is all gone it'll be gone forever as far as the lifetime of the human race is concerned so alternate sources must be developed before that happens. I guess we could go back to horses and oxen.
9212 2018-07-07 17:30:21 Many people who use this Doterra Oil , call it their happy oil. It lifts and soothes emotions . If you would like to know more about this oil , I have made a video about it , I could forward to you . #naturalhealing #orangeoil #essential #oils #TeresaSwann #orange #healing
9213 2018-07-07 17:30:20 She means shot down.

No, really, she means shot down.
9214 2018-07-07 17:30:18 Yeah they run and hide in a barrel of oil and coal
9215 2018-07-07 17:30:17 I hope no emergency vehicles need to get through that mess! WTF is wrong with those people
9216 2018-07-07 17:29:50 Thinking about the oil industry economist talk I had to attend last week, when he said "We're for completely free trade!" and feeling conflicted about Trump administration tariffs.
9217 2018-07-07 17:29:36 ขอบคุณค่ะ
9218 2018-07-07 17:29:35 Margins in Italy and worker layoffs.  All the auto cos, except Toyota, will be badly hurt by higher oil prices. Common sense.
9219 2018-07-07 17:29:13 You mean you agree people dont need happy coffee, mood pills, brain creamer, vitamin patches, mct oil? Whats bad is a lot of newbies think this is the foundation and the key to being successful
9220 2018-07-07 17:29:09 Can’t have a pool day without oil
9221 2018-07-07 17:29:05 Social Security is also an example of how governments wreck the 'business' - the SS trust fund *should* have a $2+trillion surplus, but congress has skimmed all that off and spent it on stuff like tax cuts for the rich and oil/coal subsidies.
9222 2018-07-07 17:28:58 You know how much delicious oil would be wasted by using the land as a race course?
9223 2018-07-07 17:28:57 Omg thank you!! Do you use the oil? Or another product?
9224 2018-07-07 17:28:51 ใช่ นานมาก5555555
9225 2018-07-07 17:28:51 The GOP oligarchs are hell bent on teaming with Putin to grab as of the world’s oil as possible. They’re building personal dynasties and to hell with everything else including the United States of America.
9226 2018-07-07 17:28:32 My coconut oil is completely liquified and it ain't even noon yet 
9227 2018-07-07 17:28:19 But, in the end, that matters very little for both oil price and the dollar. Both have been tied for directly for 40+yrs, nothing new there, and will end up where their respective supply/demand balance takes them.
9228 2018-07-07 17:28:16 well no Nazis[germans] live in Nicaragua . but lots went to Venezuela. so trump is protecting his blood lines.  and oil
9229 2018-07-07 17:28:13 I will never stop obsessing over my job. I just ate penni pesto virgin olive oil with chicken for lunch. That they provide. They provide breakfast and lunch. My stomach and heart are full & happy. 
9230 2018-07-07 17:28:11 Should of sprinkled holy oil on box...
9231 2018-07-07 17:27:29 Perfectly said, it boggles my mind how people don’t see this, why do poor republicans still side for big oil? It doesn’t benefit them.
9232 2018-07-07 17:27:24 The country is a mess. Currupt as fuck, over dependence on oil, political turmoil, nonsensical currency control systems has made their dollar basically worthless, really a whole mess of economic and humanitarian crises currently
9233 2018-07-07 17:27:12 Also with all these GOP retiring! We must replace them with Democrats! No third party this time or in 2020!GOP has proven again that they are incapable of governing anything! They work for Koch's Network & just follow orders!Do you want the oil industry to rule America? Well?
9234 2018-07-07 17:26:56 The moisturizing cream & then I put castor oil in it
9235 2018-07-07 17:26:45 Why ppl obsess over avocado so much.......it's not even that tasty......unless u smash it with some olive oil and salt..
9236 2018-07-07 17:26:14 Oil filter mounted on top?
Yes! Yes it is.
How awesome is that!!!?!
9237 2018-07-07 17:26:06 Yeah yeah yeah they had oil and we needed it
9238 2018-07-07 17:26:03 ดูจากไหนหรอค่ะ
9239 2018-07-07 17:25:50 Not sure my #peyronies is improving yet still continue to pump and use traction.  I’ve just ordered some Castor Oil and waiting patiently to hear if the NHS have accepted my consultants recommendation for the use of XIAFLEX.  In the meantime any advise would be appreciative
9240 2018-07-07 17:25:45 I typically use just a regular conditioner and occasionally miss Jessie’s curling custard. I use the Moroccan oil conditioner and it’s in a blue bottle with a gold lid (that’s my styling product) and that’s it :)
9241 2018-07-07 17:25:31 The smell of the oil paint

9243 2018-07-07 17:25:03 It's a perfect day to get your errands done.   Ask your relatives when the last time they had their oil changed.  
Remember we close at 5:00p.m. every Saturday.  
Thank you,

9244 2018-07-07 17:24:58 Elect a Republican Mayor and the gun violence will end!!!
9245 2018-07-07 17:24:56 Well unfortunately it comes.q the national security concerns when Venezuela is using oil $ to prop regimes that pose a threat to us. Have u heard of link between Islamic terror and drug cartels down there?
9246 2018-07-07 17:24:44 How about CBD oil for psychosis?
9247 2018-07-07 17:24:41 You have to wash your face first..apply it like a moisturizer and then actually put a moisturizer on over it..it helps all your pores become hella small, controls the oil  in your face and you skin be helllllla soft and supple

9250 2018-07-07 17:23:56 Peppermint oil 

-Take a few drops of peppermint oil and a tablespoon of vitamin E oil. Mix and apply to pimple, use daily to see reduction of pimples!
9251 2018-07-07 17:23:54 True only in US where land & oil is in plenty. Long Flyovers  needs acres of costly land and will cause disruption for years. Owning pvt vehicles is ok but public space like parking can't be free. Mobility of large numbers is key to our cities. Pvt vehicles are crowding out buses
9252 2018-07-07 17:23:52 I hear whale oil is pretty costly.
9253 2018-07-07 17:23:50 It really gives an aroma to the oil 
9254 2018-07-07 17:23:30 I had a "lite" recipe from the '60s or '70s for mayonnaise using mineral oil. MINERAL OIL
9255 2018-07-07 17:23:29 Just more premature “ejubilation”. Perhaps the Nobel Prize Trumpets ought to keep the lid on that anointing oil after all. This has started and ended in typical Trump fashion. The art of the disappearing deal.
9256 2018-07-07 17:23:18 The way I see @POTUS, he isn't spitting mad all the time so much as putting on the show his fans want to see.  He's a racist ignoramus, and a snake oil salesman who knows a crowd of suckers when he sees one.
9257 2018-07-07 17:23:16 Ahh thank you Chitty, lovely to hear from you. xx
9258 2018-07-07 17:23:08 Care for a wager? On the oil Crunch? I will take the under and will lay odds.
9259 2018-07-07 17:23:05 I don’t sell oil for fuck sake THE OIL CASH doesn’t go to my wallet. 
9260 2018-07-07 17:23:04 We do need environmental protection or we will all die, as the oceans and it creatures go so do we and the same goes for our rivers and forests.  It’s shown to be true that we can’t drink oil, breathe polluted air or eat coal.
9261 2018-07-07 17:23:04 Mix it with an essential oil rather than use it on its own.
9262 2018-07-07 17:22:38 How much for synthetic oil change
9263 2018-07-07 17:22:35 @GordonRamsay Hey Chef Ramsay, last week I had Eggs Benedict at a place where the hollandaise was made with olive oil. It was overly lemony with no richness to it at all. Is olive oil a proper substitute for butter in hollandaise or is the restaurant filled with idiot sandwiches?
9264 2018-07-07 17:22:32 Very sad for his loss, Fuck palm oil
9265 2018-07-07 17:22:30 Feeling productive today since I got my oil change at 9am when I got work at 11.
9266 2018-07-07 17:22:27 1hr and 30 minutes for a oil change but i only take my car to the dealer I’m sorry
9267 2018-07-07 17:22:19 Meaghan you’ve never gotten your oil changed by yourself!??
9268 2018-07-07 17:22:13 And PLEASE throw in some serious wing-kink with black, oil-slick-iridescent feathers, b/c reasons.
9269 2018-07-07 17:21:56 As I said here during the Opec Meeting the IPO of #Aramco was in doubt because 1) Oil px should be higher and more sustainable aka over 75 with low vola 2) WACC still too high due to GCC contrasts (Qatar, Iran and Yemen) 3) the Stock Exchange unclear 4) Reserves not clarified yet
9270 2018-07-07 17:21:55 Man they really sold you that snake oil didn’t they?
9271 2018-07-07 17:21:55 my favourite oil blotting sheets from daiso ran out im panicking what if they discontinued it
9272 2018-07-07 17:21:55 My friend is saying i should buy glow oil... 
9273 2018-07-07 17:21:45 @TPP_live Globalism is dead. The world will come to us as we will become independent of their oil and buying their junk to defeat Communism...(which succeeded..)

Everyone wants to trade with us...

Trade barriers only hurt the consumer and the workers...

9276 2018-07-07 17:21:31 Kevin here loves corporations running the country.  If a politician came to him and spoke to him about his economic issues and didn't take money from Oil Companies and Wall Street... well fuck that person. Kevin fancies himself a corporate whore.
9277 2018-07-07 17:21:31 I couldn't afford both the condoms and the lube so I thought it would work it didn't

I bought some Cbd oil for dogs. It’s in a dog treat I bought. So I have been giving him that every day. So maybe that will help? Thx U!
9288 2018-07-07 17:19:32 For decades we have called it thiwan and we bought oil from Iran.
9289 2018-07-07 17:19:28 My entire pot of coconut oil is now fully liquid. My children are also melting. Send help.
9290 2018-07-07 17:19:23 Btw...this stuff is great for after all the meds your baby is on.  It's a great everyday...a little goes a long way & since it's an oil you can just mix it in food. For longevity & a pain free existence!

9295 2018-07-07 17:18:37 Maybe? If it’s not oil that’s a good thing. The coolant has that sweet smell to it.
9296 2018-07-07 17:18:16 Dinner idea: chicken breast seasoned w black pepper, garlic salt, &amp; bread crumbs. Squash & broccoli, light olive oil. Bake 415 ~35min.
9297 2018-07-07 17:18:14 For our church fete tomorrow, we will be making a melon salad: four different melons chopped into small chunks, add small cubes of feta cheese, flavour with classic vinaigrette (honey, olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper). Recommended!

9302 2018-07-07 17:17:38 What about 1000’s of children’s getting injured, oh I forgot Yemen don’t have oil.
9303 2018-07-07 17:17:35 詰め込みすぎかもしれない
9304 2018-07-07 17:17:28 I hate the smell of olive oil so much but my friends told me it makes your curls healthier so here I'm with a plastic bag over my head dying to wash my hair from the awful smell

9306 2018-07-07 17:17:06 Supposed to be clocked in. But this oil change is taking forever. Probably cuz they go above and beyond and clean the car out and gives a car wash
9307 2018-07-07 17:17:03 Ofcourse i know:

Commoners like myself
Ppl who hv been deprived of their rights for better lives for last 50 years.
Young ppl who were losing hope in Pakistan n taking the trips in high seas or inside an oil container to better their lives

People of Pakistan r behind him
9308 2018-07-07 17:16:59 I will never take my vehicle to @chevrolet ever again. STILL sitting waiting (3 hours later) FOR AN OIL CHANGE... even WITH an appointment.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Garbage service.

9313 2018-07-07 17:16:19 Close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria

9316 2018-07-07 17:15:48 I just don't get why it turned into a debate? Who could possibly benefit from climate change? The only people that can benefit from lying is big oil. Perhaps the ones who benefit from a lie are the true liars.
9317 2018-07-07 17:15:26 They don't want us to play by their rules.
9318 2018-07-07 17:15:15 That's so funny. And yet sad? With so much oil , and there governments have screwed it all up.
9319 2018-07-07 17:15:11 lol the earth is going to run out of oil and die in heat death because ppl like me were perfectly willing to spend $20 of gas on a Waffle House trip
9320 2018-07-07 17:15:00 We will just switch another source of income
We have taxes and other means to get money 

Keeo buying our oil Because it seems you niggas can't live without that oil providing dick
9321 2018-07-07 17:14:55 Can't give away all our secrets... But its a blend of soft soothing essential oils and coconut oil. Its a popular seller and everyone who has used it says it works wonders for them.
9322 2018-07-07 17:14:45 No. The oil/planet deprecating industries are suppose to become wealthy callously striping the Earth & it's inhabitants. (That's their job.)

The dissent, the opposition, just folks who aren't megalomaniacal sociopaths are not. 

Further engage if you can do so without vulgarity.

9331 2018-07-07 17:13:21 Getting an oil change
9332 2018-07-07 17:13:19 realize that this creature is nothing but a Snake Oil salesman. He is despicable.
9333 2018-07-07 17:13:06 Yes. There were international climate change accords agreed and further plans were being made before the Narcissist in Chief scuppered them in the interests of his fellow billionaires in the oil and coal industries.
9334 2018-07-07 17:12:43  Be gentle on your lashes — Although it is important to maintain your lashes and keep them clean, avoiding your eye area is key to long-lasting lashes! When removing eye makeup or cleansing your lashes be sure to use a gentle, oil free remover!

2. How does olive oil make acne better? Isn't oil bad for acne?
3. Do u apply aloe vera every day & if so what time & for how long?
9343 2018-07-07 17:10:43 More like oil and bad tanning cream
9344 2018-07-07 17:10:34 2015 feels and 2018 Twitter mix like water and oil. Nobody can tweet in peace anymore
9345 2018-07-07 17:10:32 That's how France sees Africa, too. Wonder what Emanuel Macron did in Nigeria? Some fun at Africa Shrine, but mainly lots of oil business meetings.
9346 2018-07-07 17:10:20 No, it was a really simple recipe, flour eggs oil and water but without a mixer it’s so hard to get the right consistency

9353 2018-07-07 17:09:24 Oil and water.
9354 2018-07-07 17:09:06 The sheer amount of oil you'd need to add to my face for me to get pimples would be STAGGERING, I'm so fuckin dry it's terrible.
9355 2018-07-07 17:08:51 I feel it should be ILLEGAL for government officials to lie to the public. There need to be consequences immediately. This isn’t a joke. Older folks are buying snake oil every day. They still believe to trust their President 
9356 2018-07-07 17:08:48 ...Winter is coming...

Or, at least another ice age.  Maybe stop facilitating it, Big Oil.
9357 2018-07-07 17:08:29 Yea jst don't use Johnsons baby oil as lube use their lube rather.
9358 2018-07-07 17:08:28 It’s basically eggs and oil. That way you don’t need eggs :) You’d never know it’s in there.
9359 2018-07-07 17:08:18 Even big oil doesn't deny it anymore. From the Exxon website:

"The risk of climate change is clear...Increasing carbon emissions in the atmosphere are having a warming effect. There is a broad scientific and policy consensus...."
9360 2018-07-07 17:08:14 The guy who normally changes my oil asked me how old I was and I totally forgot and had to do the math for it lmao
9361 2018-07-07 17:08:06 I believe we are of like minds, so I decided to follow you.

Why not free at-home car oil change and in-home haircuts. Free child laundry pickup!!! Now! 4 t/ kids! @jasonrantz
9365 2018-07-07 17:07:55 I had a quick weekend hike with oil prices?
9366 2018-07-07 17:07:41 Exactly, would be interesting to track month to month oil price, R/$ and fuel portion of all in petrol price.

9370 2018-07-07 17:07:03 As trade wars begin because of Trump - and gas prices go up 50% because of Trump's moving us away from clean energy and vehicle efficiency standards and back into last century to our dependence on foreign oil again.
9371 2018-07-07 17:07:02 There have been multiple ice ages and periods of warming, most well before humans became a dominant species.  Oil comes from decomposed Dinosaurs, dinosaurs were around for the ice ages therefore dinosaurs are the cause of global warming
9372 2018-07-07 17:06:54 That’s one trick the Muskrat missed in his snake oil promotion: should have fitted a graphics chip in his jalopies so you could ‘mine’#crypto while the auto-pilot drives you into the Armco.

9374 2018-07-07 17:06:21 you think Jovenel's the one that sets the oil prices? the world markets set the price, not him. Tout les pays ont augmente leur prix quand ils fallaient meme quand ils ne voulaient pas. Erreu Jovenel fe c rete ap repoussel epi kounyan lap fe peup la subit rattrapage la.
9375 2018-07-07 17:06:16 What type of oil painting art speaks to your inner self? Classic, modern, landscape, portraiture, none?
9376 2018-07-07 17:05:58 Democracy is under attack, little children are being put in cages, Putin's puppet, aka Trump, has also started a trade war in addition to committing human rights abuses. Toxic oil pipelines are getting tax dollars. But yeah, let's inflate a questionable issue from 20 years ago 
9377 2018-07-07 17:05:47 My lovely wife declares no more Nutella and threw out the jar we had after hearing palm oil kills orangutans. She thought it was the oil from their tiny crushed hands. I kid you not.
9378 2018-07-07 17:05:31 You mean countries that are muslim and have unlimited oil income  bcuz that would make no sense

9380 2018-07-07 17:05:23 When one of these oil tankers that’s being loaded up at Westridge has an incident, a collision, a fire or sinks all of this and the marine looks for that depends on it will be lost...so come and see it soon, before it’s gone!

9384 2018-07-07 17:04:57 We have had the technology to produce sources of clean safe and nearly unlimited energy for many years now. However the @GOP and the oil companies have worked together to suppress this technology.
9385 2018-07-07 17:04:49 Alaskans own 151,594 shares of SBM OFFSHORE NV, worth $2,492,862. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in NETHERLANDS.
9386 2018-07-07 17:04:42 It absolutely is political when your trying to defund your opponents donors and enrich your own by taxing oil companies and giving the money to bureaucrats in the EPA. Sending money to either won't do to help the environment. 10 years since the first alarms and nothing happened.
9387 2018-07-07 17:04:21 Holy oil
9388 2018-07-07 17:04:12 Lol Norway has health care, social security, free education, paid leave, sick leave and lotsa holidays a year. Your military is invading for oil and hardly ever to help ppl and y’all leave a bunch of refugees behind you wherever you go. So yeah, better hush dude

"Bek, the lawnmower needs oil and gas, it's turning hard and needs to be greased and the blade's wheels are too tight."

9397 2018-07-07 17:02:35 dissolveing the liberal mantra that we invaded countries for oil. Our country would expand growth and consumer confidence while lifting up the less fortunate with a subsidy on gas instead of gas taxes and lowering of gas prices...I am confident in my prognostication.
9398 2018-07-07 17:02:30 MIL ka hai  she is an expert in fish items  they had farm of prawns and fish.  I place two big leaves of curry leaves at the bottom once the oil is hot and then place the fish.

9407 2018-07-07 17:01:30 Take away the oil and gas subsidies along with the EV subsidies and suddenly EVs will be even more appealing.
9408 2018-07-07 17:01:24 The other thing that a realist needs to account for is that not all known oil can be extracted and burned. Most agree that climate disaster lies at +2C global temperatures. I grew up in a farming community and cringe at the thought of droughts/pests etc... and MB lower risk.

9417 2018-07-07 17:00:22 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

Oil moves in pipelines or on trains. 
Which of those two options is the safer?

9425 2018-07-07 16:59:29 @elonmusk Elon, I had an idea about a super long escape tube yesterday, yay glad you are working on one. Watertight, and in the tight areas, something to help them slide thru like oil, and lights along the way so they can see. Pump air thru it, but watertight so no tanks needed.
9426 2018-07-07 16:59:17 You're welcome!  haha I think we've all done that! But like I said, I do use Tom's natural lavender deodorant prior to powdering. Walmart sells it. It helps the powder stick a bit better. I've read argan oil is another alternative to the powder too.
9427 2018-07-07 16:59:16 Really? We were promised a world class spill response for BC before they started shipping oil tankers loaded down with 650 000 barrels of toxic and highly flammable Bitumen. On the anniversary of Lac-Mégantic, the first tanker sailed through the Burrard Inlet. @MarcGarneau

9441 2018-07-07 16:57:17 Well Chris, u seem to know a lot about the economy.  The GDP is actually close to 3%, but not there now. The price of a barrel of oil has risen almost $30 in 2 months. Unemployment has risen. But if $$$ is all it's about, then watch carefully over the next 3 mths. Seat belt time.

9460 2018-07-07 16:54:16 Which might yet B their undoing. Many municipalities ordering cops 2 stand down, avoid arrests. This is emboldening rioters, who are already prone 2 attacking cops. At some point cops likely 2 snap. Once one does, they all do. Watch out.

9469 2018-07-07 16:53:10 Russias economy is a 3 trick pony. Oil/gas, high end metals, and arms are about it. Putin makes his cash from oil. Europe must have Russia oil and gas. We can sanction it the live long day but Europe simply can not meaningfully sanction Russian energy. Not yet.
9470 2018-07-07 16:53:03 Picked up my car from the shop (after getting an oil change) and now something from under my hood is emitting smoke. I can’t. Fucking deal with this.

9474 2018-07-07 16:52:45 they can't produce Oil anymore, because the money that was destine to the maintenance of the equipment & the modernization of the Industry was stolen!!!

Treat asylum seekers humanely according to international law? Take care of vets instead of the oil industry?

9484 2018-07-07 16:51:30 Re Norway yes that seems like a better model to have adopted. Perhaps we thought our oil was too expensive to extract or that it was not prudent to tax the corporate profits higher. Maybe CTF argued for higher oil corp taxes I don’t know.
9485 2018-07-07 16:51:27 And those protestors are the same ones telling us to disarm.....F&$K THEM!! 
9486 2018-07-07 16:51:21 Anyone getting an oil change at the dealership should double check their engine's dip stick to make sure new oil is a honey color and not black which indicates reclaimed oil.
9487 2018-07-07 16:51:08 It's all I use, too. I do go to You Tube for stuff, but it's just to listen, not interact. Heck, I don't even leave comments there. 
9488 2018-07-07 16:50:56 Peroxide values and acid values higher than the recommended standards in a brand of cooking oil doesn’t necessarily mean that the manufacturer or someone else has been adding peroxide or an acid to the cooking oil.
9489 2018-07-07 16:50:35 Hell, even Nikola Tesla was pushing to move away from oil. J.P Morgan brought the hammer down on his alternatives. That is soooo 19th century.

9513 2018-07-07 16:47:59 Big oil and fracking got started before he took office and grew while he was in office... he never regulated it because he didn't have that authority.. even congressional democrats who were from oil states wouldn't let him.. do some research.

9526 2018-07-07 16:47:12 Chef Gusteau cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with gravy.
9527 2018-07-07 16:47:09 All I have in plain salad (kale, chopped egg, salt & pepper, olive oil) and a gas pill for lunch so I can make it through the afternoon 
9528 2018-07-07 16:47:05 Gotta go get this oil change but Idk might drive out with a new car lol
9529 2018-07-07 16:46:58 Sarah, Trump is working with Russia in mideast to formulate a peace deal with Israel. In order to assure compliance with Russias member states and oil nations. At Israels interests not US
9530 2018-07-07 16:46:54 Not with you there, I'm afraid. I don't have your knowledge & experience of the oil market
9531 2018-07-07 16:46:50 I slept through my oil change appt fml
9532 2018-07-07 16:46:45 Crack some raw rice in the oil before you put the fish to fry. It helps not to get stuck in the bottom.
9533 2018-07-07 16:46:44 These days it's so easy for customer to get fooled by any dealership. Have to watch when getting oil change that oil isn't reclaimed. Parts are not refurbished or after market. I always like to purchase my parts adhead of time so I know what I'm getting.

I’m into special FX trading too
9538 2018-07-07 16:46:10 After eating puff puff i use the oil on my hand as hair cream
9539 2018-07-07 16:46:09 I got an oil change a month ago and I'm almost due for one again and I'd be mad but it's because me and Lucas keep going on adventures and I can't be mad at that

9543 2018-07-07 16:45:45 The fries have to be a certain cut and fried in a specific oil that has been used for at least 1-2 weeks. You then need premium and pure Quebec cheese curds. Gravy can be whatever but generally it needs to be thick, dark brown and not too sweet
9544 2018-07-07 16:45:34 But that wouldn’t fit the narrative Trump and his minions, not to mention oil and coal, have been pushing. You are such a kidder, Greta.
9545 2018-07-07 16:45:13 Until she needs a oil change lol
9546 2018-07-07 16:45:05 Obviously shows then broken dawn & our of commission. Kistblook at puddle of oil on the ground
9547 2018-07-07 16:44:56 I could clean my car in the mean time butttttt no I’ll just wait to get this oil change
9548 2018-07-07 16:44:50 Good choice regardless of #NSNG or not.  Hope it was grilled whole with olive oil and lemon.  A favorite fish dish.

9552 2018-07-07 16:44:20 I hate when it’s time to get a oil change! why can’t it be like once a year 
9553 2018-07-07 16:44:04 So what are we looking at here? Inflation rate of EU against crude oil...? So what does this have anything to do with PH inflation rate?
9554 2018-07-07 16:44:03 @SethAbramson When all is said and done, and if there's anything left that we can recognize, history will show everything being done is about oil and every lie being told about Trump & Putin being "Godly" was about the Artic oil find.
9555 2018-07-07 16:43:45 Yet oil prices are climbing.
9556 2018-07-07 16:43:44 This old dude is just staring at me while I'm waiting for my oil change. I'm uncomfortable af.
9557 2018-07-07 16:43:44 @lhmauto Riddle me this Larry H Miller Honda Service Center: what exactly is the point of offering weekend appointments for oil changes if when I show up at my appointment time, I still have to wait 2 hours for an oil change?
9558 2018-07-07 16:43:35 I'm out in Buchanan today for the Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship series' annual mid-season stop at RedBud. I'll have a few updates throughout the day on both motos in the 250 and 450 classes. Racing gets started just a little after 1!
9559 2018-07-07 16:43:28 You can start with CBD oil, edibles, they even come in topical lotions etc. i notice that if I take some oil before I go to bed, I don’t wake up every hour like I usually do. I actually sleep throughout the entire night without being disturbed. It’s worth a shot

9562 2018-07-07 16:43:22 Have you tried pressing it down in a towel or paper towel to soak up some of the oil before eating it? I always over cook mine and do that and it’s so much better. They are bomb idk how to help y’all 
9563 2018-07-07 16:43:05 And opening up the two pipelines not only created jobs, but having access to local oil makes the US less dependent on mid Easter oil.  That’s a double benefit.  IMHO

9571 2018-07-07 16:42:25 I think you’ll find most of the fishing grounds belong to Scotland - and oil - and gas- and we’ll be taking them with us if  (England) goes hard Brexit.
9572 2018-07-07 16:42:23 When people really hate Trump the scion of the 1% and his looting of America - you can always count on bootlickers like @MalcolmNance  to divert our anger towards an Oil Companies target instead
9573 2018-07-07 16:42:15 I was watching a vegan cooking show and the chef said “we gonna season between each layer”... the seasoning was olive oil and flaked salt......
9574 2018-07-07 16:42:14 I'm not rich and I'm saving about 3000/year on tax liability. Which is about 250 a month. Beats seeing my taxes go up like they did with Obama.
And gas prices aren't even very high. They were 3.60-3.80 most of Obama's years, they went down because oil market crashed in 2014.
9575 2018-07-07 16:42:13 Went to Jasper to get a rental car and came back with motor oil, a filter, Freon, a paintbrush, and Chickfila.  Guess what we don’t have?
9576 2018-07-07 16:42:06 I don't see why Venezuela  can't just start producing oil. The gold is right there at their fingertips.  and of course the Kellogg factory is still there. 
9577 2018-07-07 16:41:41 Hey @larryhmillerhon riddle me this: what exactly is the point of offering weekend appointments for oil changes if when I show up at my appointment time, I still have to wait 2 hours for an oil change?

9582 2018-07-07 16:41:07 One of my exes was into pain. She liked biting, scratching, and slapping. One night she said, tonight I want you to really hurt me.

I said, “All that astrology bullshit you believe in holds no bearing on anything in this world. It’s snake oil.”

9595 2018-07-07 16:39:46 You should definitely wash them first. But in general, gloves do more damage than skin oil (to paper—photographs, for example, are another matter.)

That’s a barrel of oil...which is old dinosaurs...

9598 2018-07-07 16:39:14 Not that different.  The economy was changing. The liberal agenda was running into a lot of headway. Vietnam, rising oil prices, economic stagnation would have still impacted the Civil Rights movement.

9607 2018-07-07 16:38:37 They’re really hungry for that Russian oil. Pure greed mixed with being compromised & maybe blackmailed? Exxon Mobile must be anxious.
9608 2018-07-07 16:38:21 Awesome, so many of them have palm oil. Will have to look for this.
9609 2018-07-07 16:38:19 CBD oil helps so much, and it’s legal in all states. It doesn’t get you high either, which is great. It comes in many different forms.
9610 2018-07-07 16:38:17 That looks like an oil burner
9611 2018-07-07 16:38:11 It’s a spectacular bloom. When I first started oil painting an experienced artist once advised, “nothing in nature is contrived”. I’ve looked at life differently since then.

9645 2018-07-07 16:33:34 Of course they do, but storage/insurance is the greater cost & commercial players don't borrow from banks at LIBOR. In any case my thesis that Saudi accesses liquidity via T-Bill repos swapped for oil reserve repos (aka prepay) thereby putting the $ on #OilStandard

9649 2018-07-07 16:32:56 @realDonaldTrump  I think   "Big Oil" is really happy  with the tax cuts you got passed,  I say that because most of the money I am getting via the cuts is going to buy gasoline.  We the public are getting screwed by the Oil Companies.
9650 2018-07-07 16:32:52 If you struggle with depression/anxiety, I highly suggest trying CBD oil.

9653 2018-07-07 16:32:08 Yeah I think to an extent every politician is trying to sell a little bit of snake oil
9654 2018-07-07 16:32:00 Venezuela is a monoproductive country, focused on oil. Most of the products consumed by the population are imported. Its economy worked quite well until 2012, but the fall in oil prices and the sanctions from the US government created a kind of blockade...

9676 2018-07-07 16:29:09 Dunkin brand doesn't use oil as it's base, it uses milk and cream. Would you consider doing that?
9677 2018-07-07 16:29:02 I think that the government's regulations on fixed priced oil should be removed and a competitive market introduced #petrolpricehike @OUTASA
9678 2018-07-07 16:29:01 I forgot to mention oil field workers... even entry level pays a great wage. How do I know all this? My family and myself are involved in each an every one of those business. We cant find enough workers.
9679 2018-07-07 16:29:01 I didn’t notice much of a change when I took cbd oil. I recently switched to Kratom and that shit works so well!
9680 2018-07-07 16:28:43 He was effective just last season, still skates well for a big guy.  Kept up to McD, and he was basically the player Oil wanted when they signed Lucic.  We could use a player like that on the Leafs, as long as the deal is short.
9681 2018-07-07 16:28:39 We've used the CBD oil since yesterday for Morgan-Allen's fits and tantrums. He's been up for 3 hours and only had 2 fits for 30 seconds each! 3 hours of peace! God is great!

9689 2018-07-07 16:27:40 This is great news. Of course...actions will tell what words cannot. Will the U.S. no longer bend over for Saudi Arabia when they get rid of dependence on oil? Is this a sign that the U.S. is willing to evolve our free energy tech and dethrone our corrupt "oil owning" elite?

9711 2018-07-07 16:24:07 I don't even eat tomatoes but that looks tasty. I'd munch right down with some fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. #yummy
9712 2018-07-07 16:24:04 Make sure that you try to eat foods that are known for their protein content and also take supplements to help keep up with your protein. I’d recommend maca root, fish oil pills, spirulina, and turmeric as a few options
9713 2018-07-07 16:24:02 Sitting at the dealership waiting for my car to be finished having an oil change — so far two hours. A little awhile ago I was told I needed new brake pads. I can never leave here without additional costs 
9714 2018-07-07 16:23:53 3. The deal for Reinhart was abhorrent to Chia's tenure so far as well. He went on the advice of Bob Green, who knew Reinhart from his days with the Oil Kings, and knew what kind of player he was. But there's a big jump between juniors and pro...case in point for the big cat.
9715 2018-07-07 16:23:52 My mother is one othe MAGA and trust me trying to get a sense of compassion for this policy is like getting oil from water. It is completely useless. You would be better off focusing your energy on November. To get him out.
9716 2018-07-07 16:23:41 Exactly Venezuela, think about it, it is the perfect bloody example. It has some of the biggest oil reserves in the world and yet since a socialist regime came into power it was suddenly blockaded, one of its major resources had its price gouged on the global market....
9717 2018-07-07 16:23:33 If you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
9718 2018-07-07 16:23:17 Study is a jerk to people when they come over. There has been lots of CBD oil passed around lately.
9719 2018-07-07 16:23:10 Do you have an exit target for $TDNM?

$HAL Cs seem extraordinarily inexpensive right now. China tariffs are a risk to $XOIs but they will just switch to another supplier at current oil prices.

9722 2018-07-07 16:22:59 The only reason these enviro tactics are performed is they are staged in democratic countries. Try this in other oil producing nations such as Iran and Venezuela and results would’ve much different.
9723 2018-07-07 16:22:58 So I work downwind of the Alberta oil sands in Saskatchewan. They pump megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Why can’t we see any temperature effects? Shouldn’t it be warmer with the CO2? Is there any research into this massive real time experiment? You must know.
9724 2018-07-07 16:22:56 It's one half to one year out of phase, as it's based on 2017 income tax revenues. Regulations didn't kill oil production, it was a low oil price rigged by the Saudis. Also SAGD, as it let US ramp up their own production.

9758 2018-07-07 16:19:42 I think that comment is spot on. Chia has been steady on fixing the problems that stemmed from last season. There's three things that oil fans will always whine about: 1. It is seems as Oiler fans, we need a whipping boy, whether it was Eberle, Hall, etc etc. Ppl are never happy.

9788 2018-07-07 16:16:24 Silly is to suggest that a spill (if it happens) is a benefit due to jobs. 
But you know that, which is why it's a silly comment. 
Oil (anywhere) can spill. Tankers can spill. At least this way we are using Canadian oil, and benefiting Canadians.

9817 2018-07-07 16:13:43 In my opinion, your opinion is pure propaganda and rife w/ divisive rhetoric. Your name will be cast in the annals of history as a truly fake-full leader who stole a presidency from the American people by misleading your base with fear, bigotry, and snake oil. #thatlonesomevalley
9818 2018-07-07 16:13:43 What a crock! Tariffs and high oil prices will wipe out everything anybody got. Chumps way. Low income, high expenses.

9826 2018-07-07 16:13:05 So Barnett? We drill the oil, we blend the whisky, we generate and produce hydro and renewable power! Westminster/London take all the tax from that and our hard working population and squander it on wars, tax perks for the rich, and we have to beg for the leftovers! Fair? Nope!
9827 2018-07-07 16:13:00 OwO whats this? *notices your oil*
9828 2018-07-07 16:12:58 Even with a new pipeline we would still buy as much oil as right now. The new pipeline is exclusively for oilsand export. It is not for Canadian markets. Of all organisations, oil sands action should bit have to be corrected on this point.

9840 2018-07-07 16:11:52 castor oil! You can warm up the castor oil a little bit and mix it with any other oil like sunflower/olive and apply it to your scalp and massage it into your skin. Do it once a week and new, "baby hair" will grow. I done that after i ruined my hair by dying it a lot
9841 2018-07-07 16:11:52 If there is one place where time doesn't exist it's the chevy service center. Swear they think I have ALL DAY to get an oil change and new break pads 
9842 2018-07-07 16:11:45 It’s amazing how I can read 1000 comments on these fires and it’s all “hopes and prayers” or “sorry” but nobody says the word Climate change.  It’s as if it’s mass delusion. The OIL companies hypnosis is working ”your getting sleepy, consume, don’t think”
9843 2018-07-07 16:11:27 Since you have absolutely no clue about anything...  
Did you know that the oil industry publishes their sales numbers?  
Did you also know that you can use chemistry and math to find out what burning the fuel that they sell creates as a byproduct?  
9844 2018-07-07 16:11:13 Why @JustinTrudeau jointly funding a rail bypass line for Lac-Mégantic while pushing for oil tankers to pass through Metro Vancouver with oil tankers loaded down with 659 000 barrels of flammable sludge with Vancouver being one of North America’s most densely populated cities?

9864 2018-07-07 16:09:57 Gas easily $40 every 2 or 3 days which is about $80/$100 a week on pure gas depending on how much you drive. Tires gone cost you easily $200 a tire x4 about $800 assuming you don't get no deal on tires. Oil change gone run you a good $75-$100 if you go to a shop

9871 2018-07-07 16:09:03 Ha..A war with Venezuela will be another feather onto America's imperialist history like Grenada, bombings in African countries, Iraq(..long list). No big deal.

9883 2018-07-07 16:07:59 I saw a video on Facebook talking about the different names that palm oil is called on nutritional facts labels. It's ridiculous that companies can completely hide the fact that they use palm oil and deceive consumers without facing any legal repercussions. :(

9887 2018-07-07 16:07:31 Yes Jovenel doesn’t control the oil prices. However , he could have increased the gas prices gradually, not HTG85 at once. Sa pa fè sense. Also he could have increased the minimum salary from HTG300/day to HTG500/day. That would have been smarter.

9897 2018-07-07 16:06:07 Auto companies, oil companies and energy companies have spent billions and upon billions on political influence, supporting sham scientists and creating "phantom" doubt.

Why you’ve never lied to me before!?

9903 2018-07-07 16:05:27 I’ve been doing lots of research about it lately because it’s SO harmful to the environment and SO unregulated. They often hide palm oil as “vegetable oil” in products— you can barely track it

9905 2018-07-07 16:05:17 And some of them, the likes of oil companies, then use those initiatives to advertise as well. Elegant community projects as brand ads, while their actual drilling could be destabilising whole ecosystems.

9908 2018-07-07 16:04:35 Yet the country the 9/11 attackers came from get the red carpet, a guided missile system to attack us with next and oil contacts
9909 2018-07-07 16:04:34 That’s one in and one out each day. More, as the figure is 400. A seven fold increase in oil tanker traffic in Burrard Inlet and along our coast.
9910 2018-07-07 16:04:15 Absolutely! Every little bit helps and I completely agree. I had no idea about the Nutella brand using palm oil, so thank you so much for educating me about that. 
9911 2018-07-07 16:04:12 Churchill arbitrarily created the country of Iraq after ww1 cobbling together factions that don't get along well bcz he had in mind access to the oil there. He tried to reshape the middle East. How has that worked out?

9920 2018-07-07 16:03:15 So you don’t understand simple economics either. Unlike our oil rich friends, we sell to a huge degree before we can buy. I wouldn’t expect you to understand that
9921 2018-07-07 16:03:12 @ShahRezaPahlavi 
Country so rich with natural gas, oil, 2 major water source hot desert for solar energy should be among world leaders
9922 2018-07-07 16:02:58 The rise of oil prices is a bad omen for the economy. It has curtailed my travel this summer.
9923 2018-07-07 16:02:51 One of this week's many discoveries: leftover clams in black bean sauce and pea shoots sauteed in tons of garlic (now chopped) makes a pretty good sauce for spaghetti, with a little added olive oil
9924 2018-07-07 16:02:42 No caffeine after 4:30. Water before bed. No high action video games/ tv shows right before bed. One of those fancy oil infusers.
9925 2018-07-07 16:02:41 When I say who cares, I don't downplay the informational content of those positions. I just say they don't determine where we're heading. If your theory is true, it validates the view some expect the price to keep going up. And I believe that is the case. We'll see a $100+ oil
9926 2018-07-07 16:02:28 I hate getting oil changes

That, I can do.
9930 2018-07-07 16:02:17  oil change ain’t even help

9933 2018-07-07 16:02:03 Somebody got a whole ass Jesus oil painting out there. #DanRyanProtest
9934 2018-07-07 16:02:02 then had to figure gas, oil changes, insurance, repair, etc). They needed to budget for food (we figured a weekly average grocery list that I shopped to figure a baseline cost), clothing, personal care items
9935 2018-07-07 16:01:59 Why aren't you protesting the transportation of oil by rail?  Is that a conflict with your funders? Also, why are you anti-nuclear?  You should be for thorium nuclear reactors.  That's viable #green energy

Fear factor but all the contestants have severe allergies.

"What oil did you use? Cuz like, I'll do it, but im not about to die because you fried this in soy bean oil"
9937 2018-07-07 16:01:45 U r still spinning the oil production by 2020 line?  Unbelievable!
9938 2018-07-07 16:01:44 popcorn with manchego olive oil and parmesan oHGH
9939 2018-07-07 16:01:40 Mining oil & going bust and 50+year “free ride” isn’t normal
9940 2018-07-07 16:01:29 Whilst great to see women upsetting the status quo in terms of science and engineering, is Shell Oil really a company that you wish to endorse?
9941 2018-07-07 16:01:13 this may be basic but i feel so accomplished bc I’ve changing my engine oil on my own, changing my break lights on my own, paying my own bills, and driving to different cities alone. just a whole lotta other things on my damn own!
9942 2018-07-07 16:01:02 yeah bro most bmw’s instead of needing oil changes need oil added to the car because they basically eat the oil... i can’t speak on the porsche though but most cars like that are a waste right now since we young...

9946 2018-07-07 16:00:53 Outside of Oil & gas, they have no industries of note to accomodate refugees.
9947 2018-07-07 16:00:52 Well.  Ignoring your unreasonable accusation.  Alberta went from about second highest income tax & no sales tax early ‘70 s to lowest taxes in country (by mining oil) “called Alberta advantage”.  We pay about 2/3 of other provinces (due to low inc tax & no sales tax)
9948 2018-07-07 16:00:44 Scotland is underselling itself by remaining tied to U.K.  Ireland is a lot smaller country, economy & population with no oil or gas ....Scotland would thrive!
9949 2018-07-07 16:00:31 Do you prefer oil finish to the other alternatives? I've tried a few and can never make up my mind which is best

9955 2018-07-07 15:59:50 明智がシータクでもなく誰かのよこした？運転手付きの車に乗ってたのすごい薄い本み感じる…でもイケメェンだったぁ…
9956 2018-07-07 15:59:49 Yeah...notice how many of the records were set nearly a hundred years ago?  Was it global warming then or just weather? Can’t blame SUV’s for that. It’s been hotter and colder through out history. Long before industry and the oil era.  Follow the grant money Seth.
9957 2018-07-07 15:59:33 懐メロ感じますね
9958 2018-07-07 15:59:10 If the trade tariffs on German vehicles stays in place for a while the US will make more cars. If Iran causes Oil to spike, the numbers will be lower.
9959 2018-07-07 15:59:08 ありがとうございます！
9960 2018-07-07 15:59:01 The consistency of my coconut oil tells me everything I need to know about the temp outside.
9961 2018-07-07 15:58:45 My coworker pulled a muscle so my other coworker gave him THC infused coconut oil, he took too much and now he’s stoned and won’t take off these disposable gloves because they’re “too comfortable.”
9962 2018-07-07 15:58:38 hot pan, cold oil, food wont stick. so called non stick pans aren't healthy for you.
9963 2018-07-07 15:58:17 Gunplay jus got his oil changed and bath but to feed him next putting him on full #MyCar
9964 2018-07-07 15:58:16 Kerosene illa.. crude oil
9965 2018-07-07 15:58:15 I never used patchouli oil, I hated the smell of it even then. My biker jacket was sold in the early nineties with all my hand drawn graffiti painting still on it.
9966 2018-07-07 15:58:10 In some regard, soft commodity prices follow the price of oil..which is up..
9967 2018-07-07 15:58:02 Oil Tip of the Day

Remember that overnight success usually takes many years to accomplish!
9968 2018-07-07 15:57:52 Burnt myself with hot oil today how’s your day going?
9969 2018-07-07 15:57:49 The problem is plastic is a byproduct of oil refining. Looking at how much plastic there is, how much waste will produced at a refinery?
9970 2018-07-07 15:57:49  Guess that’s one way to do an oil change on a Honda...seems kind of expensive tho...
9971 2018-07-07 15:57:47 lumaklak ka ng el shaddai oil tas sumama ka sa maraming padasal pati na rin sa cell group ni pastor gelo  AHAHHAHAHA
9972 2018-07-07 15:57:43 True enough. We need to switch from veg oil to healthier alternatives like coconut oil.  And reduce our carb intake through less grains, potatoes, and sugar.
9973 2018-07-07 15:57:42 อ่ะอีผี รีกันทั้งทล.
9974 2018-07-07 15:57:24 Not "mad" just kinda bored with an at least a 3 hour wait for an oil change lol, so yes:-D
9975 2018-07-07 15:57:12 I need my oil changed and my car washed
9976 2018-07-07 15:57:04 @realDonaldTrump-No need to worry about higher gas prices. DARPA, the MILITARY COMPLEX, DEEP STATE, etc. has free energy technology. Time to implement. Oil has already destroyed our environment,stolen our money,etc. Time for us to move on.
9977 2018-07-07 15:57:03 Now days a lot of women learning how to change tire, change oil in their cars, I mean that’s how soft they got my beloved brothers....... it’s ok once in a while, but constantly doing the men role.
9978 2018-07-07 15:56:54 70 dollar oil changes. I don't want to live on Earth anymore.
9979 2018-07-07 15:56:46 Sames. Plus, I’ll put a little oil on them.
9980 2018-07-07 15:56:39 This is about oil and money going into rich peoples pockets
9981 2018-07-07 15:56:23 The year is 2055. The oil wars are over and the world is now run on big dick energy

9987 2018-07-07 15:55:49 Why is my oil change 71 fucking dollars tho
9988 2018-07-07 15:55:47 If it's just oil they need howz about having Spanky call his Saudi friends? Or his coal pals. Maybe they could come up with automobiles that run on coal? Think of all the jobs created in West Virginia.
9989 2018-07-07 15:55:36 And unlike snake  oil seller Sven he gets them playing from the back
9990 2018-07-07 15:55:28 A friend of mine made a medicated lotion using bees wax, coconut oil and cannabis concentrates. It smells great and works fast. My trigger points don't feel like I have anything pressing into them anymore. #MedicalMarijuana #YouDontHaveToSmokeIt
9991 2018-07-07 15:55:06 Oops, missed the growth in mining. 

Plenty of jobs if you want to drill for oil, cut down trees or mine coal. These were yuge industries in the 1950’s
9992 2018-07-07 15:54:49 Like how do I go get my oil change 
9993 2018-07-07 15:54:35 I’ve been using Woodoc these last couple of weeks. Danish oil was sweating out and wouldn’t cure enough to buff 
9994 2018-07-07 15:54:32 Have to say I was some what of a skeptic when it came to CBD oil, I first started noticing a reduction in pain after only three days, I have now been on it for two weeks and the pain is literally gone... I am now a believer ..
9995 2018-07-07 15:54:26 No! Democracy and Freedom have absolutely nothing to do with selling oil to China. This is about “expanding” oil patch activity, doubling up the pipeline so we can burn more fossil fuels and expedite the poisoning of the air you’re currently breathing! #Hypocrite
9996 2018-07-07 15:54:22 My mom has screws and metal plates in both her knees. She was hurting after her flight to see me - I put some CBD oil on her knees and she felt the pain go away! It’s truly a miracle.
9997 2018-07-07 15:54:20 Thanks!!! I also use Jamaican Black castor oil and aloe vera as a leave in
9998 2018-07-07 15:53:53 The only nail varnish remover i can get here contains oil, in fact it seems to be more oil than solvents. It has to be just about the worst thing for surface degreasing ever. Don't know whether it's the same for you some 1000km away.
9999 2018-07-07 15:53:49 -Spray perfume to the areas where your skin is thin (e.g. wrist, neck, behind your ears etc)
-Moisturize first and then use perfume
-Apply vasline/oil/lotion or anything oily and then spray perfume.
10000 2018-07-07 15:53:30 32さいおめでとう
10001 2018-07-07 15:53:29 By Nov. folks are going to realize Trump's tariff war hurt the red states. Gas and heating oil costs going to spike. We could be worried about war in N Korea again because Trump gave up power, didn't gain any. Jobs going overseas. 2019 Trump's impeachment, indictments will start.
10002 2018-07-07 15:53:25 Ok! 
10003 2018-07-07 15:53:24 Nae doubt m8
Was probably walking doon the High St waving a saltire a few weeks ago singing Tory scum out & screaming about WM stealing North Sea oil, but that’s all right in SNP Scotland, in fact, it’s encouraged & applauded
Bigotry’s allowed if it’s the right kind of bigotry 
10004 2018-07-07 15:53:20 Oooo like this pharmaceutical corporations, the oil corporations who have more hold than anything yet where are you all protecsting these.... Oh wait your not because the media hasn't told you to lol

10008 2018-07-07 15:52:49 His shit look like one of boosie kids lmao he definitely need the coconut oil and like 2 more weeks of wolfin
10009 2018-07-07 15:52:34 Oh I wish, but the entrenched fetishism of oil and gas in this state means that *even here* the break even point for solar on this place is ~20 years. #CrimeAgainstHumanity
10010 2018-07-07 15:52:29 We hope an honorable man emerges, someone that would be business oriented, put a lot of oil money into other sectors and grow them. So young men can think out ideas and become billionaires. I want to own a helicopter and go from Amaifeke to my business premises all over Nigeria.
10011 2018-07-07 15:52:11 Wasn’t that Moller-Maersk that announced previously that it was no longer handling Iranian oil because of US sanctions?

10018 2018-07-07 15:51:25 As this pipeline will carry oil to the USA and not tide-water...
Watch for the complete lack of opposition to it's construction.

10024 2018-07-07 15:50:30 the types of fat which make me ill are soybean oil, walnut oil, something to do with omega3/omega6 ratios, (guessing) perhaps similar going on with fats in meat. there are very few bacons I can eat, I don’t eat chicken, turkey, not most lamb 
10025 2018-07-07 15:49:57 @WeCanCureCancer  Hello nice profil! Maybe you can put more information about hemp oil, thc vs cancer sure if you want.. Videos, articles.. I live in Turkey, in my country only CBD oil has just legalised. But you know it should also contain THC to fight with cancer.
10026 2018-07-07 15:49:52 Those confusing Elly Karuhanga with Gen Kayihura's lawyer Ellison Karuhanga should note that the former is the father of the latter. Elly Karuhanga is one of Uganda's most respected Senior lawyers. Also a former MP for Nyabushozi, Elly Karuhanga is an Oil & Gas Law Expert.

10030 2018-07-07 15:49:33 4 whole eggs, spinach,celery, peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Cooked with coconut oil and, apple cider vinegar. Pink salt, black pepper, turmeric, and cayenne. Even on low carb diets, it’s important to get that fiber, and healthy benefits from spices.
10031 2018-07-07 15:49:29 Alcohol and gambling (combined) in this province make up a bigger percentage of Alberta's GDP than oil does. What % do you think oil is on Canada's GDP? It's becoming less significant every year.
