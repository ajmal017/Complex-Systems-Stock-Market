2 2019-06-17 23:58:08 Yes! Also, Pomp I have a question. Maybe you can do a podcast episode on it. What happens to stocks if we see crypto currencies start to take over? Does wall street switch to Satoshi’s? Do they become worthless? If crypto is the future, does owning stocks still make sense?
3 2019-06-17 23:57:24 Canada is Doomed ... Doomed I say.... Doomed. Just stay stoned bro. Buy the Cannabis stocks. Get rich quick man.
4 2019-06-17 23:57:02 Support ban on bump stocks 
Limit mag capacity 
Training should be mandatory..like in hunters course
5 2019-06-17 23:56:31 That's how I roll? In the South we chase Women not Stocks!

7 2019-06-17 23:54:09 So, your failure to accomplish this as promised when you were “elected” by only the electoral college itself, is a the same reason you want to be re-elected!!!???? Because you failed the first time around making us “great”??? great laughing stocks to the entire rest of the world?
8 2019-06-17 23:52:32 Jim your stance on oil stocks is dumb and lazy. Oil is still the engine of the economy.  $mro $hal $slb $xom
9 2019-06-17 23:52:31 Is this an economic stimulus plan? BRB, investing in shoe stocks.
10 2019-06-17 23:52:04 You say that and the stocks go up
11 2019-06-17 23:50:41 I was being sarcastic. IT DOES MATTER but apparently for now the idea is bonds rally and stocks rally. Maybe the opposite will also be true when bonds soon take a break maybe stocks do too
12 2019-06-17 23:50:34 I'm going to check my stocks. #SixWordHorror
13 2019-06-17 23:50:07 $bynd if @sec disallows algos from trading certain crazy stocks like this one, I bet it would regain some sanity and restore a bit of normality in the markets.
14 2019-06-17 23:49:28 Very much so. What is the ROI you would like on the land? Most stocks and normal ROI’s run in that 5-10%.
A lot of investments are a lot less.
15 2019-06-17 23:48:10 In other words: Feinstein and her husband went long on gun and ammo stocks expecting price to skyrocket after Hillary's "sure thing" victory.

Now they wanna create fear and speculation in the markets to get their money's worth
16 2019-06-17 23:47:15 $CGC $CRON $ACB $TLRY etc. Cannabis stocks. A bounce is just a bounce. Even if they do happen to go higher form here, there are much easier and likely much more profitable trades in this market to take advantage of.
