45 2018-02-07 22:10:07 Simply put if you measure any commodity (for example) against anything else other than US Dollars overtime (say 100 years) you will see what value really is. Prices of most commodities are generally stable....the dollar has collapsed (as has most all fiat currencies).

59 2018-02-07 21:28:05 Many countries are in poverty, such as Africa because of the EU custom union, keeping them in poverty by placing protectionist high.tariffs on agriculture produce with 100 percent Tariffs on processed goods.

63 2018-02-07 21:15:57 BC residents should think twice about boycotting this countries number 1 commodity. How about those BC ferries and all the ships in ports distributing commodities across the province via  tractor trailer more so where does all the fuel used in BC's 54 mines come from?

71 2018-02-07 20:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
72 2018-02-07 20:30:42 Why does everyone talk about gas prices and house prices even though they are not lion's share of most Americans spending? Because both crystallize inflation w/o government adjustments. (Gas = one of very few commodities directly purchased by consumers, almost same wrt land)
73 2018-02-07 20:29:46 THerfore the lots of forces which are "fighting"  in "forming" the mass habits in every detail:

thr print etc..
74 2018-02-07 20:15:32 Imo there is a rotation going into commodities. This is not a day trade  theme. This theme is macro.

81 2018-02-07 19:53:23 Every single asset, all the securities and commodities will be tokenized, plus add 5 more billion people from developing countries that now with their cellphone and internet can have access to global financial instruments. F*ck man, Im so excited.

83 2018-02-07 19:42:17 Since it’s a USDA report... the logical answer would be all commodities will be down.  Maybe not limit... but down.
Think of it as a ‘buying opportunity’...for some.

178 2018-02-07 15:16:27 All commodities should be deforestation free. When buyers demand deforestation free veg oil, avoiding deforestation is competitive advantage for producers.
179 2018-02-07 15:11:56 I think the USD token will not be useful to pay for services, I see a world where tokens will be able to exchange between them in markets as commodities, companies will transform to netwoks and Netflix, Spotify, Uber will issue their own token. That ends in a true democratization
180 2018-02-07 15:09:45 Agreed. That’s the problem when trying to turn products into commodities (eg 80% of features at 10% of price).

264 2018-02-07 09:17:17 Slavery was not the central cause for the civil war and anyone who teaches that is wrong. When the south succeeded the north lost access to numerous agricultural items such as cotton,tobacco etc. which means commodities was the actual cause of the civil war not slavery.

266 2018-02-07 09:13:35 Value is subjective. To claim otherwise, and to then presume that you are cabal of asserting the value of any and all commodities, is the height of arrogance.

348 2018-02-07 03:15:48 No it doesn’t. That is just Marxist claptrap. The City grew up organically from coffee shop meetings of people. Why? Because they satisfied a need. What is the real economy? It is millions of people buying and selling things. That’s all. Commodities are not notional they are real
349 2018-02-07 03:08:06 No. It removes money from the real economy that could create jobs and industries and income for people in favour of financial speculation and algorithms about the fluctuations in value of notional commodities.
350 2018-02-07 03:03:05 Trade Set Up: Markets Set For a Positive Start Due To Rebound In Global Equities & Commodities
351 2018-02-07 02:51:56 #CPI and #PPI next week is where things get interesting. If we see #Inflation, yields are going to continue to pressure the #Fed to raise rates as #Bonds continue to sell-off, pressuring the stock markets. That's if the markets don't unravel first. #Hyperinflation #Commodities
352 2018-02-07 02:44:24 Moving oil via rail as opposed to pipeline is not only less safe, but also takes precious rail time from moving other commodities that can't be moved via pipeline.
353 2018-02-07 02:43:59 Trade Setup
Markets set for a positive start due to rebound in global #equities and #commodities

Spike in Copper, Zinc is positive for metal stocks and high beta sentiments

After a rout in last few sessions, Bulls will face hesitation so, volatility could remain high this week

355 2018-02-07 02:37:05 I am full time Trader since 2004, earlier I trade stocks, Forex and Commodities now only Crypto.
356 2018-02-07 02:33:34 Capitalists became PUNTERS on the VOLATILE stock markets to get richer, instead of profiteering from their produced commodities.
357 2018-02-07 02:31:33 I feel like I’m in crazy land. McDaniels failed in Denver and crawled back to NE, Jon Gruden had a worse coaching record than Jim Caldwell, and both Gruden and McDaniels were the hottest offseason commodities.
358 2018-02-07 02:17:11 The only thing that dictates prices of commodities is: the OPINION of people and not oil prices.
359 2018-02-07 01:45:59 Good point. It’s not a few bad apples, it’s a culture of rape where women and girls are treated like commodities for men’s gratification. All men are complicit and must come to terms with that first and foremost. It’s time for introspection and listening, not speaking.
360 2018-02-07 01:39:10 Sen Neufeld - This is not about pitting those who support resource development & pipelines against those who don’t. The point is that we have a premier within the federation who wants to have final say on exports of one of our most valuable commodities./9
361 2018-02-07 01:33:21 In the last one year we have done what we call export improvement initiative for so many commodities. That means we are bringing those commodities that were lying low to ensure that they are properly positioned for export...

364 2018-02-07 01:26:36 Disruption creates profit by driving down costs which it almost ALWAYS does by removing jobs or paying people less. As long as we treat people like commodities automation will always mean more poverty

367 2018-02-07 01:01:05 I was thinking the exact same thing. Gotta be. I'd rather have Brady and known commodities for a couple of years and then maybe look again... Or maybe BB said, hey, you want these guys after Brady retires?
368 2018-02-07 00:51:10 Trading Places isn’t about the stock market. It’s about the commodities market.
369 2018-02-07 00:27:57 Si Duterte pa rin. Those 16 million trusted him. The least he could do is to forward pro-people laws and projects. But what did we get? Thousands killed in the drug war, yet drug problem still not solved. Anti-poor tax reform leading to increased prices of basic commodities
370 2018-02-07 00:26:04 Los “logros” duraron mientras la soja valió. Con el alza en las commodities se pudieron sostener también los populismos de Correa, Lula y Chávez. Luego todo se derrumbó
371 2018-02-07 00:17:06 SHCOMP will provideimpetus to metals countries producer and select commodities currencies such  as Aussie, chilean peso and loonie
372 2018-02-07 00:00:48 El alza de tasas en EE.UU., además de encarecer el financiamiento externo para Argentina, también llevaría a un fortalecimiento del dólar y a una baja del precio de las commodities que exporta el país.
 
No es tan fácil reducir la inflación, ni revertir la situación bananera
