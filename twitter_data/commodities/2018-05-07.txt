39 2018-05-07 21:20:16 Kikikiki. Sure! The price of commodities are not rising, it means common man is still able to buy. If prices go up it affects common man. It means commodities in the market are available because the country is able to pay for imported goods. Has fuel gone up? No.!
40 2018-05-07 21:18:18 I agree completely, I wouldn’t either! But that is a personal preference. So long as it doesn’t contribute to the demand of more animals being used as commodities, I see it as a non issue
41 2018-05-07 21:15:44 That being said, i dont think it's vegan to wear even used leather, as it still treats dead animals as commodities.
42 2018-05-07 21:15:37 I agree. How dare anyone question a former player. Anyone want some commodities investment tips from Dave Snuggerud?
43 2018-05-07 21:14:44 2. Commoditising & Distribution Strategy: To attain such scale. The product must be commoditised, and should be readily available. Yes clothes are a commodity. But view this brand in terms of the following commodities “Instant noodles, fuel, recharge card, and coke”
44 2018-05-07 21:12:50 Exchange prices determine-by-measurement the value of commodities.  Note that, because the same exchange may be subject to more than one measurement, this also means that values are indeterminate -- there is a kind of uncertainty principle at work -- but ....
45 2018-05-07 21:09:33 Thank you EK for taking the time to provide your expertise.  Oil is a challenging sector as are all commodities.  It's simply amazing how you navigate all the turns - I haven't read anyone on twitter yet who does what you do.

57 2018-05-07 20:16:46 reduced to the status of products/commodities whose value is measured in lbs and £s. So it's not so much that tree-planting is the end in itself. I've just been led to believe that this would be a beneficial, worthwhile and perhaps even essential replacement. As for replacing
58 2018-05-07 20:03:58 The means of financial transaction in global markets is a very complex paradigm. You’re going to need to ask “why” more than once to get any insight, as per usual.

Cryptocurrencies are not just mere commodities, and people in power currently are not just shit-talking to buy.
59 2018-05-07 20:02:24 market. My position is just that care and respect aren't philosophically consistent with treating animals like products, commodities and economic resources, or killing them in scenarios where doing so is unnecessary and avoidable. (2)
60 2018-05-07 20:02:09 He isn't saying that. I think you could earn money throwing your waste away properly! Most commodities have a value.
61 2018-05-07 20:00:50 In large part because the cost of commodities has outpaced wage growth, though. two incomes, or an extremely well paying job, are needed to avoid abject poverty.

69 2018-05-07 19:24:13 Agree they will pull out the 2008 playbook but the result will be hyperinflation. Inflation first, then hyper. Minsky melt up in commodities and stuff. Then hyper.
70 2018-05-07 19:18:15 The structural, cultural change we need is one that eliminates the climate of toxic masculinity that causes some to think they are entitled to the physical and emotional attention of others.  Love, affection and sex are not commodities to be distributed.
71 2018-05-07 19:16:30 I suspect it’s because they are traded like you would train commodities in a stock market. Like, you charge it higher during times when demand is expected to be higher and lower charges when the demand is expected to be lower
72 2018-05-07 19:15:23 Jesus, y e s. The whole 'sex and body parts as mouldable commodities' thing is where TRAs and Incels intersect.
73 2018-05-07 19:11:44 Buying or selling stocks or commodities based upon what you believe @realdonaldtrump will say or actually says is a fool's game.

He will make a statement with so many holes that he can walk through it in both directions and exercise deniability or feign victory.
74 2018-05-07 19:09:46 Your professor of mathematics can answer that question since he also knows about assets management and commodities. 
That global oil prices plummeted in the last 3yrs surely isn't strange to any of U but that most oil dependent nations including NGR suffered may be strange to u
75 2018-05-07 19:05:48 'Thou shall not kill' (OT). Human embryos are human beings at an early stage of development -as you once were. IVF involves making 'spare' embryos, killing some & experimenting on others. Is that how you would want your early-stage offspring treated? As commodities & rubbish?
76 2018-05-07 19:04:55 Agreed. But we are also needlessly dependent on Russian trade and commodities. This are not the best sets of policies to nurture an open and competitive economy. At some point, like all small states, Armenia will need to choose to align to the EU or Russia but not both.

82 2018-05-07 18:38:59 I see the overall message of humanity attempting to set up a peaceful, weapon free, money free eutopia and failing miserably on a routine basis. They were constantly having to kill with weapons and trade commodities despite their stated values. Like Orwell's Animal Farm.
83 2018-05-07 18:36:16 Stick to the stock bond currency and commodities markets please & spare us the political propaganda.
84 2018-05-07 18:34:25 That’s how it works. People get jealous of the rich because of their wealth and their futuristic commodities. But capitalism creates cheaper and better products over time through the incentive of profit. Could everyone in the past afford a cellphone? No. Now everyone can.

89 2018-05-07 18:21:26 So now I look for 197ly potential runs...now I'm thinking of doing 150t to 197ly (refuel), then 150t from 197ly to 394ly  Pick up 2 commodities that you can make profit on at 2 different economy systems

114 2018-05-07 16:48:09 Unless the finance minister cut short the GST and other taxes on many commodities, commonly used by our people ‘drastically’ and bring the prices of these items considerably low, the present BJP govt. will face adverse set backs in the next elections!.

120 2018-05-07 16:26:15 That’s interesting. I think he shows the hypocrisy of America. The history of violence(native Americans, slaves) continuing to this day while America benefits and exports its culture, But America’s culture is black culture. So black entertainers become commodities

126 2018-05-07 15:57:13 (1 of 2) In regards to consumerism, consumption itself is not "evil." Rather, the evil results when the elements of life are reduced to mere commodities...
127 2018-05-07 15:56:51 (2 of 2) ...The geochemical, biological, social, and spiritual relationships that make the elements of life thrive are ignored and not appreciated when they are only viewed as commodities. (Wirzba, Living the Sabbath)
128 2018-05-07 15:56:36 Hablando cosas contradictorias y apelando como siempre al populismo, dice que va a proteger el ambiente pero todas sus propuestas son minería y petróleo. ¿Duque de sus cursos en Harvard no le explicaron que productos primarios y commodities no generan riquezas ni desarrollo?
129 2018-05-07 15:44:20 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
130 2018-05-07 15:44:09 The labor theory of value was not a prescription, it was a descriptive theory about the value of commodities, and it was false.  Despite that, the basic logic of capitalism--that it must replace human labor power with technology to reduce costs--has held true.
131 2018-05-07 15:43:28 No porque la tendencia de los últimos dos gobiernos era hacia la estanflación/hiper con deuda interna, estatismo, tipo de cambio congelado y déficit fiscal. Pero mientras tuvieron superávits gemelos y commodities altos sin duda fue todo para arriba.

The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general."
135 2018-05-07 15:29:55 I'm sure that by lunchtime the "Molliefuscation Blog" will be up and running with a hot take about sausage making in the 1920's and the "immeasurable price of freedom and commodities"
136 2018-05-07 15:24:38 And to all of you who bother to read these tweets the issue for many was not about access to abortion @ the time. It was access to support, empathy & acceptance. But backs were turned & we & the infants were used as commodities.
137 2018-05-07 15:23:45 @RahulGandhi Dead children in Govt. hospitals for lack of Basic facilities, Costly Daily-use Commodities, soaring fuel prise, Media spin and Corporate Governance? Reference: BJP ruled states.

139 2018-05-07 15:05:13 I doubt he will ever answer you. 

People who publicly promote pseudoscience rarely admit defeat. They lose money and credibility, commodities they value.

141 2018-05-07 15:03:14 Interesting idea from @dvhankerson for PPP to have #ArtificialIntelligence invest in labor needs. Get industry commitment for putting profits into a fund for public benefit, like how egg, beef, milk & other commodities fund ads & PR #ETDC
142 2018-05-07 15:01:46 Estoy pensando en eso sí, esencialmente casos Brasil y Argentina vs Chile, Perú, Bolivia... todos apreciaron después del boom de las commodities, no sin conflictos (nacionalizaciones de Evo), pero con menos complejidad que en Argentina y Brasil (según mi opinón). La pregunta es..
143 2018-05-07 15:01:39 Rare commodities are worth more than good
144 2018-05-07 14:59:44 Ever since "activist" became a "job description", there's been a scramble to turn resistance movements into commodities and their leaders caricatures - to be bought, sold, licensed and merchandised to the highest bidder.

It's not authentic.
We have to be aware of who we applaud.
145 2018-05-07 14:55:56 Let's just say it and get it out there, most able-bodied people support disabled verbally, but don't give a flying fig newton about our socio-economic degradation. We are seen as expendable commodities
146 2018-05-07 14:55:31 Algunas personas aceptan que el petroleo cambie su valor día con día, la plata, el oro, el dólar, se llaman commodities y cotizan en bolsas, también la gasolina, en el mundo real no existen los precios controlados...

148 2018-05-07 14:50:24 @ModernInvest I called the office SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, who is suppose to be meeting with the CFTC today. They told me they don't have anything on his schedule regarding digital commodities or any other meeting for that matter. What do you think? #Ethereum
149 2018-05-07 14:46:05 2. Announced Minimum support prices of different commodities and Subsidies Agriculture outputs as compare to neighbouring countries. 
3. Focused on primary education In existing system, Stop new building construction. Solarised all schools & Colleges @BBhuttoZardari @ShahNafisa
150 2018-05-07 14:44:39 With informal markets absorbing most of agriculture produce from farmers what can be addressed to make this markets work for small scale farmers who need to get good value for their commodities.
151 2018-05-07 14:36:05 "Tokenizing stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities will literally put 0 trillions of dollars into cryptocurrencies." Tokenizing them will probably bring new money into buying them -> more speculation -> more liquidity -> more value
152 2018-05-07 14:28:08 Indigenous people of Assam staying in hills and waters are not getting Land pattas, have to buy livelihood commodities at costly price,inflation is always at high rate. Rather deporting those foreigners to their country y Govt is trying to increase the burden on its own people
153 2018-05-07 14:24:51 Las retenciones parecen tener q ver con el precio de los commodities en el mercado mundial. Cuando suben mucho se aplican retenciones para corregir desbalances. Los commodities están en general en baja. Esa sería una explicación económica y no ideológica como Ud plantea
154 2018-05-07 14:20:30 Now the justification Will be spending for bullet train or some social projects. No idea doing wrong with justification. GST and demonization have really affected common people livelihood. When will all prices and commodities prices be lowest and help common people to survive.
155 2018-05-07 14:19:41 Pronostic ? XRP = ETH = Commodities ?
156 2018-05-07 14:16:57 Minister of environment should also intervene in Protea Glen protests . Waste tire burning contributes in the environmental pollution inparticular air pollution. I have sent numerous proposals to her office with intentions to reprocess waste tires to valuable commodities.
157 2018-05-07 14:14:22 No wage growth, weaker $USD and higher commodities price: perfect recipe for #stagflation!
158 2018-05-07 14:13:42 When I signed up for commodities I told them no PB. Guess what I STILL GET every time I p/u commodities? PEANUT BUTTER! They give you a shopping cart of food & you get what they have to give you.

164 2018-05-07 13:45:45 The question is not only middlemen.Perishable commodities  when over supplied to demand tend to downward value.Non corrupt administration in MSP can alleviate  some misery.Import of agri produce shud be banned which has been doubled in Modi govt.
165 2018-05-07 13:43:42 Ah, I see why you are confused. Y'see, women are commodities, much like food and wealth. We simply assign one woman to each man, after ensuring she is of sufficient value of course, and then he can rape her as much as he wants, and that is the easiest way to stop violence forever
166 2018-05-07 13:42:54 Yes... No hotels rate & pathetic food ... soaring prices of hotels rooms & commodities
167 2018-05-07 13:31:00 The issue of oil prices should not be taken lightly.With the spread of City areas, better connectivity of villages and interstate transport of commodities,the oils have almost become an essential commodity.Whatever crude prices, we must Maintain our prices at a reasonable level.
168 2018-05-07 13:27:28 When will we stop treating children like commodities to be picked, packaged and bagged and start thinking about them in terms of their needs and how our education system might work best for them.
169 2018-05-07 13:23:08 Fully agree. And yet, this primacy of monetary valuations is nothing but a constructed way of looking at goods. Slavery abolishment was just a change of valuation of humans: from commodities 2 equal entities. We can do likewise with food, if we reject the absolute commodification

172 2018-05-07 13:19:22 Vanguard commoditized indexing, and turned it into a fee battle (because that's what happens to commodities).

Advice not conducive to commoditization. Hard to replicate & systematize, varies by advisor, etc.

Competitors more easily value-add their way to differentiate.

183 2018-05-07 12:30:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
184 2018-05-07 12:27:44 I understand skepticism for sure, but as of now bitcoin is just dictated by math as opposed to whims of government and printing press. A recession like 2008 hits again, people will be looking for commodities both ‘worthless’ and actual lol.

188 2018-05-07 12:03:39 Just because petrol, diesel and gas prices are high, prices of all commodities - rice,pulses,vegetables, fruits, all other necessaries are also of high cost. Every section of the population is affected. And Modi ji is not answering the people on these issues.
189 2018-05-07 11:57:38 The line in ‘this is america’ “we just wanna party, party just for you” refers to black people as commodities and fetishized entertainment.

192 2018-05-07 11:27:38 Narendra Modiji, which modern India you are talking about?
India where:
Farmers are neglected 
Rich &  poor gap widening 
Dalits & minority's more insecure 
Women treated as commodities 

Or just bad mouthing Congress & Gandhi family and rest of the opposition?

Old India better?
193 2018-05-07 11:21:33 Not many have positive experiences with the Justice System. It costs a lot of money to be a member where in most cases it is unaffordable. A plutocracy running on it’s own economy of marauding Lawyers. “Victims are commodities,& the crims are the engine room,Judges CEO’s.”

198 2018-05-07 10:51:49 See chapter 1, section II of the Principles, titled "Labour of different qualities differently rewarded. This no cause of variation in the relative value of commodities."

231 2018-05-07 07:24:27 Really? Then why when ppl get commodities are they given beef stew? Hindus can't eat beef. Plus the meat in it is not grade A beef. When I had my church I saw what ppl got from commodities because they used my annex to distribute from. All fruits in corn syrup. Bad for diabetics!
232 2018-05-07 07:12:46 Correct, price for f commodities has sky rocketed since BJP era and the everything has gone from best to wrost. They are loading all the money in Swiss bank no where else...

235 2018-05-07 07:02:39 Sorry if I was sharp . . . I spent years of my life trying to understand the fetishization of commodities and whst lay behind M-C-M' and eventually concluded there was nothing there that couldn't be stated more usefully in other terms
236 2018-05-07 07:00:54 Rattle bjp like how AAP demolished them in Delhi using the price issues of essential commodities

238 2018-05-07 06:58:43 How you can defend this kind of reasoning is beyond me. This is making women commodities to pay off bets etc. Cry my beloved country.

241 2018-05-07 06:44:43 I'd like to see this done with more world commodities!
242 2018-05-07 06:38:11 "What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.…. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man – and turns them into commodities…." Karl Marx
243 2018-05-07 06:37:36 He thinks women are commodities and property. His patriarchal mentality will definitely cost him. EDpfeee
244 2018-05-07 06:31:01 Still some people support the price rise, be it a any govt. It has to think of common man. Rise in petrol rise will affect price rise in many essential commodities, our PM said this before he was PM. Now he forgot. Acche Din Kaha hai. Khwabo khayaloe ki govt.
245 2018-05-07 06:27:43 I am wondering and investing the origin of the term 'Zoo'. I believe, somebody had chosen the Zoo a place for entertainment and treating animals as commodities in typical business strategy. I don't believe the intention of Zoo is for serving animals.
246 2018-05-07 06:18:58 @cnbcKaren God Less your guest host for announcing Commodities are “a good bet,” “Buy on the Dip” has done me well. #thankyoukaren #thankyocnbc
247 2018-05-07 05:54:10 Nationalize healthcare, education, energy, public urban housing, and critical telecom infrastructure. There will still be a free market for innovators who want to get rich by selling commodities and services that aren't necessary for basic survival. This…isn't that complicated.
248 2018-05-07 05:54:10 So @nelsonchamisa wants to give ED his 18 yr old sister for a Presidential win? Are women now commodities? Why not giving him say a house maybe?

NSEL Traders!!

Biggest Joke of the day! LOL!

You want payment in commodities?
Go talk to EOW post auctions!
251 2018-05-07 05:23:27 #VanRE is merely another form of commodities trading; if you see that say gold or oil is falling out of favour you exit your positions in them, especially if you'd rather be on the sidelines while some external turmoil works itself out. Like Victor Adair on MoneyTalks.
252 2018-05-07 05:17:48 Ha! If not for China pushing up commodities prices for natural rubber, copper Indon wudnt be able 2 pay down IMF debt Camdessus/Soeharto.
253 2018-05-07 05:16:23 Money is created out of nothing, all commodities are ultimately shaped out of nature, but money artificially affects the presence of absence of all commodities.
254 2018-05-07 05:04:31 @narendramodi @RSSorg Demand for Cash will go up Rapidly as Banks Charging Abnormally  Account Holders for there Own Earned Money....Govt shall focus on #lesscash Transactions not #Cashless
Cash Requirement also going up due to High #GST Rates Mostly Commodities falling under 18%
255 2018-05-07 05:02:58 Or maybe he's merely taking profits so he can reinvest in other venues, much like a commodities trader or day trader does
256 2018-05-07 05:00:01 Commodities: Wheat -1.66%, Cotton +1.55%

259 2018-05-07 04:36:43 I respect your opinion but I politely disagree. Sell as we might, our valuable commodities at lower prices than they deserve, China still sets itself out to make money at the expense of any and everything else which, in the long run, doesn’t do much.
260 2018-05-07 04:30:47 Women have agency. Women are not commodities. Trading women is not our culture.
261 2018-05-07 04:30:45 Zinc Prices in China increase further today. This is looking good for Vedanta, HIndustan Zinc.

263 2018-05-07 04:24:39 ...there is a difference between China dominating the markets by signing good deals which favor them more and modern colonialism. If you and I do business together and you undervalue your commodities & I buy them & resell at thrice the price, it’s your fault not mine.
264 2018-05-07 04:19:40 Below 10720, Nifty looks sell for 10640. 

Around 10620-640, Nifty looks buy for 10680-700.

265 2018-05-07 03:57:05 i don't see how it could finance any meaningful UBI

the only place that has enough money for that is high personal incomes (aka the rich) and maybe corporate profits

cryptos are not even real money, more like commodities (e. g. precious metals, etc)

270 2018-05-07 02:43:28 yeah but what is produced & how it’s distributed is so important that calling corps proto socialist j bc they practice command but also produce extractive useless commodities & distribute along class lines isn’t rly fair. command isn’t a synonym for socialism
271 2018-05-07 02:26:22 Because Truth is the best weapon in Re 10000 crore fraud in #NSEL, which is promoted by Jignesh Shah and FTIL. How was 13000 investor money given to defaulters without any collaterals? What happened to commodities in #NSEL warehouse, for which contract notes issued to investors?

277 2018-05-07 02:04:31 In today's reputation economy where everyone is a brand, the truth and facts have become expendable commodities! The key reason for this is Social media!
278 2018-05-07 02:02:47 True, not ethanol by itself, but the other addatives too....  Use to buy bulk fuel and it would last for months or more... Now stabilizers are hot commodities...
279 2018-05-07 01:49:25 The mere fact that the prices of your basic goods and commodities, services have gone up - driven by the additional taxes of implementated by TRAIN, cannot be remedied by the “higher” take home pay. The burden is passed to the consumers, most of which are the average Pinoy.
280 2018-05-07 01:43:50 If they will not sale the essential commodities, then how they will buy votes in the election? It's a money rotation policy of the company.

I had no idea that the Canadian government had so much influence on oil futures in the commodities market!
289 2018-05-07 00:46:11 In Tripura cost of living is high. In W B due to communication, supply of essential commodities, foods etc are huge so prices are low. If such a situation can be created in Tripura the tension to run a family will get lower resulting less disputes. CM should think over it.
290 2018-05-07 00:44:44 commodities all gearing up for take off? metals to follow?
291 2018-05-07 00:43:56 I'm not even sure where to begin here because you're so heavily indoctrinated with marxist propaganda. So I guess i will start at the beginning. First of all, when people voluntarily trade, they are not trading commodities of "equal value", as Marx put it in Das Kapital.
