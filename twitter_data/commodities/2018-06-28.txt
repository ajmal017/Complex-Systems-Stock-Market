36 2018-06-28 21:20:47 To trade something YOU would have to be the owner of the said property so in this case, the trade was humans exchanged for commodities instead of currency. IF you charge someone a car to fuck them you'll get charged with prostitution... trade, cash same thing...
37 2018-06-28 21:14:21 We got a President clearly not interested in bringing the people (yeah, even the ones who voted for him) together, but dividing them.  That’s what a businessman he is.  We are all commodities to be sold off and traded for his pocketbook.  If you are for that, you’re as broken.
38 2018-06-28 21:13:39 Buying precious metals or other nonperishable commodities is a decent way of acting on non-confidence in financial instruments and currencies.

40 2018-06-28 21:05:11  but we've had the wettest year so far! The Victorians wouldn't be spouting such rubbish - they'd say ooo the population has increase by c20m people; come on everyone let's build some reservoirs; instead of relying on the water table! Idiocy of privatisation of commodities!
41 2018-06-28 21:04:24 Enough is never enough if drastic actions are not taken by citizens. Rather than talk, talk and talk (Those in the corridors of power are immune to that) can't we show our disgust by boycotting  commodities produced by the perpetrators.
42 2018-06-28 21:02:42 That's it!  You got it! "you suddenly have twice as much of it"

That's exactly what happens when you print enough money to double the supply. It falls in value and all prices for good are driven higher because of all the extra dollars floating around bidding for commodities.
43 2018-06-28 20:48:55 Great point—bringing liquidity to a market that needs it is the secret value-add of many of the best middlemen models, e.g. Marc Rich in commodities trading back in the day. He basically invented a spot market and then became its main market-maker.

70 2018-06-28 18:16:10 I would posit that the weak dollar was a result of the point in the cycle where Row is growing strongly and investors seek higher yields/commodities. Also, low rates were coincident with a pick up in activity as QE short circuited the behavioral doom loop.

98 2018-06-28 17:07:16 Bitcoin "ETFs" are, in most cases, not investment companies.  When we think of Bitcoin ETFs, we're thinking usually of S-1 filers, which are exchange traded commodities or exchange traded commodity pools.  The ETF Rule won't impact them.

111 2018-06-28 16:36:38 Provavelmente aumentar a participação chinesa na compra de commodities brasileira. Eles têm investido pesado também no setor energético do país.Mais isso só saberemos se for noticiando nos meios de comunicação, afinal eu não trabalho no Itamaraty.

128 2018-06-28 15:32:43 China is procuring commodities at non-market prices. Others will follow. Commodity prices will not surge as some expect. @AndrewBellBNN
129 2018-06-28 15:22:14 Ah- actually there's no mistake. Commodities move 365 days a year for various reasons, generally supply/demand driven, and that's the case here too.
130 2018-06-28 15:15:36 Maybe short term.  I don't think energy is anywhere close to being solved. Oil and commodity futures were down 83% at one point (lots of reverse splits). I use commodities/oil, health care and real estate as hedges on major expenditures.

146 2018-06-28 14:16:57 What you're describing is half right. Commodities are not luxury items, and TVs have become commoditized. Smartphones have not... yet.

225 2018-06-28 04:59:54 Yep. You can model this as the stock-to-flow ratio of the staking resource (e.g., hashing power). BTC's incredible stock-to-flow ratio vs. natural commodities is misleading: capping the quantity of the resource shifts inflation up 1-level of abstraction to the meta resource.

227 2018-06-28 03:58:43 Technically, I like the bounce off the 200 day. But I go back to the, commodities prices affect oil and gas companies too much and I think violates my expectations on risk and rate of return.
228 2018-06-28 03:57:06 #gold has dropped 8% in the since early April.
Risk reversals still show rising demand for #XAU put options (bearish bets), i.e. investors are likely expecting a further drop in prices

229 2018-06-28 03:45:39 Using commodities as a hedge against inflation is  an age old practice. What's the problem?
230 2018-06-28 03:41:04 All fake news and bullshit. They don’t invest in an emerging asset class until the volatility is the same as commodities (less than 1.87% volatility a day)
231 2018-06-28 03:37:45 I’m not Muslim, but you know what Dutton et al “I hate you also”...and yes this mother is right ‘you are not human’! By your degrading treatment & making refugees beg for normal existential commodities you have intentionally dehumanised these refugees for your own sick reasons.
232 2018-06-28 03:28:28 Interested in buying your commodities newsletter, but I live in another country plus I’ve never bought a stock in my life
Is your commodities newsletter suitable for me?
233 2018-06-28 03:24:54 You’re apologizing for a group which calls for the death of Jews, drags gays through the streets, and thinks women are commodities. Congratulations.

235 2018-06-28 03:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
236 2018-06-28 03:12:24 Commodities Trading Results (B) - Brent oil:-

1. [14.06.18 - 28.06.18] - Long 76.71, TS 77.54, (Gain 1.08% -Int) x20
237 2018-06-28 03:11:12 When, in the future, we have access to unlimited resources of such valuable Earthly commodities, what will become of our Global economies, I wonder.

239 2018-06-28 02:57:00 Alice the sad truth that I would accept is we are not complete as a family. My dad has already left us and we would take up the cudgels and learn the art of survival in our everyday living while the price of commodities are rising up plus the price of medicines.
240 2018-06-28 02:47:26 Thanks for the follow @CrudeAdventures @CrudeAdventures looking forward to rich #Commodities insight  #OOTT

242 2018-06-28 02:18:49 Zito that is low blow and short sight. The US has petroleum reserves but it’s a net importer.Export and import of commodities is determined by demand and supply we would still import cooking oil from everywhere. Trade wars are won  only on paper. Think out the box! CCM shortage!
243 2018-06-28 02:16:23 It’s never as easy & romantic as it seems.  Like life itself, ag commodities move in cycles & usually when one segment of ag is rising it’s because another is falling.  Many of us make a living via non-farm income letting the ag receipts cover taxes & overhead for the land.
244 2018-06-28 02:06:40 We’re all just commodities to you & your ilk, aren’t we Daniel? Like sex slaves at an ISIS auction.
245 2018-06-28 02:06:23 Trump doesn’t know Jack Shit about commodities. Nothing. Zip.

Don't you have some oil commodities to trade in your mom's basement?
247 2018-06-28 01:25:01 meu pai tava me explicando o que é commodities e ele simplesmente DORMIU no meio da explicação e eu nao sei o que é
248 2018-06-28 01:15:44 Hottest commodities. Water, meat, & drugs.
249 2018-06-28 01:09:43 World reserver currency comes at a price the paradigm is stuck. Weaker dollar = rising rates on a dept ridden globe is a catastrophe strong dollar = commodities and EM no bueno. Something is got to give
250 2018-06-28 00:57:25 It's an option, but should Crawford/Veteran Backup go down, I'd think that Forsberg is an emergency safety net. Without him, there are two unproven commodities at the NHL level.
251 2018-06-28 00:54:31 Saw that WSJ article how commodity oriented funds have been shutting down. Last time we saw this it was close to a bull in commodities. Seen them wash out before as AUM dries up.
252 2018-06-28 00:48:24 Automation is a different beast than benefits. But it does stem from the same issue:

Employers looking at employees as commodities, not people.
253 2018-06-28 00:38:38 Marx would be turning in his grave if he became a GIF fetishism of commodities.

257 2018-06-28 00:15:52 The evidence in the US turned negative and so did shares. Industrial commodities largely followed suit, although oil was a notable exception. The strengthening US dollar dominated currency markets @MicMcCarthy_CMC
258 2018-06-28 00:15:47 "going on ...except the usual money laundering and trafficking in human commodities especially with suture materials and yet the economy, global economy had to grow and grew it did at a GPA of 2.5% globally.  yet at Oriental in Vegas, RJ and Bach drank too much and the Jones town
259 2018-06-28 00:08:42 besides, many commodities have gone below the cost of production.
260 2018-06-28 00:06:42 No, the real luxury is consuming animal products. The real privilege is the system of human privilege which underpins people's beliefs that they're entitled to use other sentient beings as though they were mere commodities.
261 2018-06-28 00:02:15 What about commodities exposure to western financial firms? Investment capital? 

Agriculture industry and automakers would be decimated.
262 2018-06-28 00:01:47 Depreciating peso, rising inflation, rising prices of commodities, alienation of foreign allies, loss of territory, and a president who seems hell-bent on breaking every standard of morality and decency.

Move forward? Funny. That's not how the country seems to be going,
