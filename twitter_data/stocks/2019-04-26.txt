5 2019-04-28 23:53:13 Not interested as investment and I agree with your concern. Also not considering XPO, but I have followed $SPOT since IPO and I have written an article on $XPO. I am intrigued by its CEO Brad Jacobs. The rest of the stocks: invested or interested.

13 2019-04-28 23:42:02 A further shift to socialist government in Spain tempered market enthusiasm spurred by fresh all-time highs for US shares on Friday night. Rising expectations of a US rate cut saw investors pile into North American stocks. @MicMcCarthy_CMC

16 2019-04-28 23:40:15 Sunday thought: Stocks go up and stocks go down but time is constantly ticking away. There has never been a better day to call up your parents, children, siblings, or a friend just to remind them that you love them. Cherish each day! Hope everyone had a blessed weekend.

19 2019-04-26 23:58:42 The @CramerClub isn’t about picking the same stocks as Jim

Jim’s investment club is about learning the tools and tips on why he buys certain stocks and the lessons from wins or losses

Also, comparing it to an index fund isn’t accurate since Jim has 3 day restriction before buys
20 2019-04-26 23:58:19 Shareholders cannot be banned. When money is involved, you cannot just smash the ban hammer. There are contracts in play. If there is not a sinkhole to push the shareholder to sell his stocks, he wont or at least does not have to.
21 2019-04-26 23:57:43 Basically took a cash advance out on America and gave it to those who hold the most stocks. And guess what happens next? The middle class tax breaks END in 2025 While Corps get their Cuts forever!! You know what that means? WE SLOWLY PAY BACK THE CASH ADVANCE FOR THE RICH!!

26 2019-04-26 23:53:59 He already did. Bump stocks.
27 2019-04-26 23:53:39 I think he said 45% of stocks are up 20% or more for the year?
28 2019-04-26 23:53:36 Is it true that the NRA hosted a man who:
   wants to take the guns early, wants to raise the age to buy guns to 21, and has banned bump stocks, in a gun-free room,
   on the same day a foreign agent working for a life member gets 18 months in prison.
Is all this actually true?

I don’t get it.

At this point, you may as well head over to the casino because that’s basically what you’re doing...

Gambling.

Make some realistic cash and THEN choose to invest in something.
38 2019-04-27 23:57:32 Except of course your legally purchased bump stocks. Those you must turn in or risk 10 year in jail. This happened directly from Trump!

44 2019-04-27 23:53:27 Speaking of “federal gun control,” Trump has imposed a federal regulation which bans and confiscates bump stocks from all Americans who legally purchased one. Why hasn’t the 2AF spoken out against this?

76 2019-04-27 23:42:47 for me to believe any (potential even) bear thesis I need to see bonds squeeze and transports and durable goods start declining materially.  Housing stocks are the new Netflix /momo catnip so totally unreliable at this point IMO

82 2019-04-27 23:35:52 Everyone loves a crash as that’s where the most money is made. Buy stocks when the prices hit rock bottom with panic sellers losing out then when the stocks rise they earn a fortune.

2. As far as I understand it is your thesis there is something extraordinary here. So, you tell me.

93 2019-04-27 23:26:48 Berkshire was a tax avoidance scheme which bought dividend-paying stocks then reinvested the earnings.  This converted dividend income taxed at 50-92% since 1936 into capital gains taxed at 12.5-28% (aside from 1936-37 and 1976-77). Buffett hated Bush's low tax on dividends.
