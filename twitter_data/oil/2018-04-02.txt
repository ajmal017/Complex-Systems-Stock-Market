45 2018-04-02 23:56:35 Since most of the billionaires who support the sitting president have investments in oil, this is not surprising!

60 2018-04-02 23:55:23 obviously know nothing about Alberta or the money that we sent to have not provs. You know shit about the oil industry the ppl and what we have achieved. If we didn’t have divisive assholes like your self in our gov with shit policies we would of faired better in the downturn

63 2018-04-02 23:55:02 yeah, i use micellar water to remove really heavy make up!

oil cleanser is for remaining make up, sweat, dirt, sebum, etc. 

water-based cleanser is for the actual cleaning.

65 2018-04-02 23:54:22 depends on which oil you talking about
66 2018-04-02 23:54:17 Makes perfect sense. Removes individuals authority to pass judgement and gives authority to tribunal of elders, judges.
67 2018-04-02 23:54:14 People drench their face in coconut oil and think they have some intellectual insight. Get on with your greasy ass face.

71 2018-04-02 23:53:24 tell her "okay woman. first, get a pan. Next, put some veggie oil on it. Now you put what you want to cook into the pan and then put the burner on to cook it. Next you watch it and season it while it cooks. When it looks yummy you turn off the burner"
72 2018-04-02 23:53:13 It was tasty, and I was able to cut sugar and oil down by using unsweetened applesauce.
73 2018-04-02 23:53:09 And olive oil?

87 2018-04-02 23:51:05 Passover rolls, aka Passover bagels or Passover popovers. (They're like a paté choux, only with oil & matzah meal instead of butter and flour.) You can also make pancakes with matzah meal.
88 2018-04-02 23:50:53 I would imagine MOST of BC aren’t eco-terrorists, but yet somehow government all seem to pander to them. Canada is losing about $15 Billion/ year because we can’t ship oil to the world market, that is begging for it. Just wish most Vancouverites understood that...

92 2018-04-02 23:50:35 Brake into my mouth with a hand of rusty nails, tied up by the neck just to peal at another smile. Breaking my hand into a cage made of rust, breaking my bones.  Crippled bones sticking out of arms, set aflame with motor oil and kerosene. Take to the blood like a wild dog would.

100 2018-04-02 23:49:59 There was a treaty in the 1990s to share expenses and revenue from oil drilling.  Argentina under the first Kirchner administration tore it up because they wanted it as a means to an end: to control the islands.
101 2018-04-02 23:49:34 Trader Joe’s Tea Tree Oil Pure Vegetable Soap! It comes in a package with two bars and I just rub it on the areas that need the most lovin’ twice (maybe three times) a day and it seriously feels amazinggg

107 2018-04-02 23:48:45 Pruitt allowed lawyers at Devon Energy Corporation, oil/gas giant, to write a complaint to the EPA under his Oklahoma AG letterhead, which he signed and sent as his own.

 When you are elected can you write a law making this illegal?

112 2018-04-02 23:47:39 By lowering the price of oil duh...
113 2018-04-02 23:47:34 Alaskans own 1,179,762 shares of JXTG HOLDINGS INC, worth $5,788,171. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in JAPAN.
114 2018-04-02 23:47:31 The US has screwed itself by running deficits to spend on a military it can’t afford and to secure cheap oil on which its economy depends. China holds US$3T in reserves - watch it buy US stocks as the DOW falls and the $ falls while the US continues to buy Chinese goods #MAGA
115 2018-04-02 23:46:36 We vote with our wallets. The vehicles we need are here now. It’s largely a matter of helping folks understand the score in order to make the most prudent purchase. The less money that lands in the oil companies pockets, the faster we move forward.
116 2018-04-02 23:46:30 It’s not just Trump, this is the Koch Bros and other oil rich Oligarchs doing.

Pruitt allowed lawyers at Devon Energy Corporation, oil/gas giant, to write a complaint to the EPA under his letterhead, which he signed and sent as his own.
119 2018-04-02 23:46:24 Wtf was that tub of white goo Crisco used for? Was it just congealed oil or was it some other unhealthy product.
120 2018-04-02 23:46:20 As a fellow Oklahoman, I'm appalled at his behavior, however, I'm not surprised. He has spent his time in the pockets of oil companies (like almost every politician in this state) and he has forgotten he serves people, not money.
121 2018-04-02 23:46:05 Silver 500. Gold 10k. Oil 1k. And of course, BTC 1,000,000.
122 2018-04-02 23:46:00 Tea tree oil reduces acne literally OVERNIGHT!
123 2018-04-02 23:45:57 Awful & takes a long time. I had so many expensive wool based fabrics- hand-wash-they couldn't take the temperatures needed. Also any wardrobes/chests with slightest gaps/keyholes. Fill, even if blu tak. Bought big bottle of cedar aromath oil & used on interior of same. Took 3 yr

126 2018-04-02 23:45:50 Smart move on Cenovus’ part. They buy their oil at cheap WCS price and sell the refined products at WTI price, smart business, good hedge. Hence the need for another market other than the USA. Or maybe our Canadian companies should be looking at buying US refiners?
127 2018-04-02 23:45:38 Gold and bonds rallied and oil plummeted as growth fears plagued markets. Currency market reactions were more measured, but the safe haven Yen outperformed commodity exposed currencies like the Australian dollar @MicMcCarthy_CMC

134 2018-04-02 23:45:13 I need to stop procrastinating on this oil change
135 2018-04-02 23:44:46 I forgot to clean the dick off my car and went to get my oil changed and the guy laughed at me

138 2018-04-02 23:44:31 I was told peppermint oil will help turn a baby. I have used it all day & so far all I can tell is that I smell like a candy cane!
139 2018-04-02 23:44:19 Especially since most of the manufactures have already updated their production lines to comply with the rules. This @POTUS is just trying to help his buddies in the oil industry. #corruption
140 2018-04-02 23:44:08 I finally get this insane clown posse administration. It's all about undo, not do. No ideas. No dreams. No vision. Just undo everything possible so the country seizes up like an engine without oil. Putin's master plan is reality.
141 2018-04-02 23:43:49 What about the previous debt on oil which is left off.
142 2018-04-02 23:43:46 yes saturated is fine, i was referring to how coconut oil does not have any EFAs that makes it less of a choice but of course, everyone has a choice to follow/consume what they want.

144 2018-04-02 23:43:37 Have you actually read the SEC filing for $ZN The warrants are exercisable at 3.00 and the subscription rights are effectively a 10/1 split (each share is worth .10 of the value of $5.00) This is not a good situation for longs at all combined with the fact they've never found oil

146 2018-04-02 23:43:23 استاذ ابوحامد, أغلب التطور السريع والهائل في عملية حفر الابار لكن الكومبليشن ماتغير فيه الا القليل. سرعة نضوب البئر هي المشكلة الاساسية ف معها عمليات الحفر في دوامة مستمرة.
147 2018-04-02 23:43:22 Maybe. But I can't count the bearish tweets I've read on oil all the way up. I don't get the hate for this asset.
148 2018-04-02 23:42:47 Ulta has this fruit juice infused lip oil and bitch. I’m obsessed.
149 2018-04-02 23:42:22 When church speakers say things only lawyers say: "unconcentual immorality"

I probably misspelled their godly rape-phrase. 

Probably because this is snake oil 101 for protecting your risk liability.

152 2018-04-02 23:41:57 From Oklahoma--oil producers control everything. Truly very few in state government care about anything outside of fossil fuel production/tax breaks.  State is too red to vote them out.  Very disheartening.

154 2018-04-02 23:41:24 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?
155 2018-04-02 23:41:14 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
156 2018-04-02 23:41:06 I love that I started Bae’s locs and I’m the only person who does his hair, he went from waves to shoulder length. I love that after I oil my family’s hair he oils my hair and massages my scalp.

162 2018-04-02 23:40:09 Always best to put a pic like this into context. 2 freighters had collided in Burrard Inlet & bunker oil escaped as result. What is bunker oil? It's fuel for a ship's "gas tank" - ya know... so their engines can operate. Nothing to do with any oil tanker.
163 2018-04-02 23:40:03 Buying oil rn
164 2018-04-02 23:39:29 Yeah but you want those same kids to go fight in a war that the worst president this country has ever seen BUSH STARTED FOR OIL
165 2018-04-02 23:39:10 Your MCM goes to the dealership to get his oil change 
166 2018-04-02 23:39:01 OK let's start with mismanagement, giving away our resources, not getting true value which on its own could pay us all a minimum wage, like they're experimenting with in Norwegian countries and do in Arabic oil nations. You realise the dole is so low you can't even pay rent.
167 2018-04-02 23:38:53 You're right on the money. I'm willing to bet many of those teachers voted for the Republican legislators who would rather subsidize oil companies than pay them. 
Fear of immigrants trumped getting paid.  
168 2018-04-02 23:38:52 This clown Pruitt is on the oil lobby payroll,has been for years fighting for oil companies. He is the swamp ,with no regard to safety,and clear air and water. Blaming Obama is horse shit, we demand clean air ,water, soil,and safe working conditions i.e. coal mines.
169 2018-04-02 23:38:39 @miaokuancha once upon in Africa, i was walking with a friend of mine, several other Americans & a handful of Africans

the Africans asked about Iraq, it was early February 2004, ~11 months after invasion, still no WMD
there was plenty of stolen oil though
170 2018-04-02 23:38:34 If you talk to economists, they're unanimous (left, right, or centre) that a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions. The Trudeau-Notley compromise is based on (a) reducing demand, using carbon pricing, while (b) continuing to ship AB oil.
171 2018-04-02 23:38:33 Must @MBuhari borrow? He's recovered trillions from looters,  saved trillions from TSA, oil revenue has increased, more trillions raked in by customs, etc Why is he still borrowing?

174 2018-04-02 23:37:38 Oil? Really?
175 2018-04-02 23:37:07 EPA and WaPo ignored President Obama’s failure to act decisively during the Gulf Oil Spill, because they run cover for their allies and are unconcerned about impropriety.

185 2018-04-02 23:34:56 So black people kept side eyeing me every time I told them that my scalp doesn’t react well to oil. I tell my mother that and boom she’s massaging glycerin in my scalp and all my issues vanished.
186 2018-04-02 23:34:52 The increased duty makes the price go higher, when the crude oil price also increases. The govt. has changed the tax rates for petrol a lot of time last year.
187 2018-04-02 23:34:51 It's all to make the oil billionaires even richer, and control the people.

193 2018-04-02 23:34:18 @AlexHolleyFOX29 What type of thermal protectant or oil do you put in your hair after blowdrying and before flat ironing it? It always looks so shiny but not oily or greasy. Thanks.
194 2018-04-02 23:34:16 I gave them the benefit of the doubt last summer and they failed yet again. It's april and we still haven't replaced Emenalo. Clearly evident nothing will change with these clueless oil sippers

196 2018-04-02 23:34:14 RAF Tornadoes specifically targetted ISIS oil installations in Syria. Going back to the original topic , @hilarybennmp was right.
197 2018-04-02 23:34:13 Nothing like some lavender essential oil in my humidifier to get my testosterone flowing. 
198 2018-04-02 23:34:03 Right?! My oil company wanted to show up in the afternoon to inspect the tank. She's like it's only going to be 15 minutes. Like ok... I'm going to be sleeping lol
199 2018-04-02 23:34:01 the woman at bath&bodyworks had me try all these things and put oil in my hair and i bought everything she showed me so i think it's safe to say I should be carefully watched when I'm around salespeople
200 2018-04-02 23:34:00 Saudi Crown Prince says Israelis have the right to live peacefully on their own land. The new Saudi Crown Prince is becoming the Mid East Change Agent in attempt to diversify the economy away from oil.
201 2018-04-02 23:34:00 It costs more for safety too so we shouldn't do that?Markets dictate progress until the don t have to. Like when Reagan told us we have unlimited oil, we don't need cafe standards raised. That set us back 20 years,we would be driving electric and even higher mileage cars already.
202 2018-04-02 23:33:54 Get a rubi. They’re more environmentally friendly! And USB rechargeable. And you can fill them with CBD oil.

205 2018-04-02 23:33:34 you are right but NOT coconut, people really dont know it here in US and its a new fad. But Coconut oil is 99% saturated fat with NO essential fatty acids. You need fats with EFA

211 2018-04-02 23:32:51 Also
You're destroying public education, depriving the poor of food & medical care, selling public lands to oil companies, allowing corporations to pollute air & water, encouraging banks to crash the economy again.
212 2018-04-02 23:32:51 えっへん
213 2018-04-02 23:32:41 Identification and enforcement can be addressed with changes to the law. Just like NY and Oregon, and others, just did. Plus, they fixed the Fed law problem that fails to capture all DV cases. Do you have a problem with making those state laws federal?
214 2018-04-02 23:32:30 Then you are still woefully misinformed. The simple act of not bombing their oil Instillation and routes allowed ISIS to build an $8 billion economy across 3 nations.
215 2018-04-02 23:32:16 a select few scientists (the ones that side with oil, natural gas, and chemical manufacturers, some making well over 200k a year) with dodgy credentials are taking very large gratuities to lie through their teeth to the public? Which seems more logical to you?
216 2018-04-02 23:32:04 #oklahomateacherwalkout Stand strong Oklahoma teachers. Your profession makes every other profession possible. Oklahoma is being ravaged by fracking. Make the gas and oil companies put money into education.
217 2018-04-02 23:32:01 You might be pregnant if you didn’t have them before. Bumps are normal, they are glands that create oil for your nipples and get slightly larger or bigger when pregnant/breastfeeding

225 2018-04-02 23:31:00 Talking out of both sides of your mouth depending on what "Herr leader"/big business wants..how much $$ do you have personally invested in oil and gas? The curious want to know. Can't say states have rights under some circumstances but not others if they don't suit YOU'RE agenda
226 2018-04-02 23:30:48 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed & given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator! Obama gave a speech at the Paris accord, about climate change, then went back to Washington DC & signed permits for big oil to drill in the Arctic!

247 2018-04-02 23:28:36 Yes, it will. It is now up to individual oil companies to do the right thing and exercise great CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). Their mandate, to do that, has to come from their own environmentally sound commitment to their shareholders as well as their stakeholders

272 2018-04-02 23:24:53 So raiding other countries for oil, gold and all their weathly resources they can get their hand on is fine. Raping them of their wealth and calling it help is fine. Wise up. Starting wars. Blowing you country's then charging them to rebuild. Well done you.

281 2018-04-02 23:23:28 It's not Trump.  The bankers have had this crash coming for a long time.  They may even keep things afloat and ride the crude oil crest...but I wouldn't count on it.  They don't like Trump and he's about to expose them.  So, they may just pull the plug, literally. #lightsout
282 2018-04-02 23:23:26 Not only did Jesus provide free healthcare, but there are a number of experts who believe he used cannabidiol oil as part of his anointing oil. Suck on that, @GOP!

287 2018-04-02 23:22:38 The oil-industry-sponsored press has a lot to answer for.
288 2018-04-02 23:22:35 Yeah he is nice, definitely proved to be the best hs player. Its a shame he bought snake oil from Coach K, unless they get help inside,  teams will just zone them. Bully ball won't work next year against experienced wings
289 2018-04-02 23:22:22 Exactly. We have medium income and property taxes nationally, pretty high sales tax (9% in my county), toll roads, casinos and oil but totally crap infrastructure and services.
290 2018-04-02 23:22:13 kung kinsa nag kawat sa akong walet sa work, malumos unta ka sa frying oil piste
291 2018-04-02 23:21:37 Well the liberals do want to destroy the oilsands. After all we know what Gerald Butts’ agenda is. He helped destroy Ontario and his sights are now focused on the oil industry in AB.
292 2018-04-02 23:21:33 Even the oil is there for a reason,and they wonder why the earth is detariating .
293 2018-04-02 23:21:32 I asked Moe to rub bio oil on my belly, and since he always wants to do shit his way, he spilled oil on my brand new CK panties!!!!!
294 2018-04-02 23:21:25 We need a strong economy and a clean environment. Who doubts that? Leaving valuable resources in the ground is utter stupidity as other nations will supply them. World needs 250+ M BOE of energy DAILY. 1/3 of it is oil. The vast majority of the remainder is coal, nuclear or hydro
295 2018-04-02 23:21:23 BP projects that we will be out of oil in 53 years...why is that not commonly known. Also we are expected to run out of trees in 300 years. TREES PEOPLE!

302 2018-04-02 23:20:21 hey @EPAScottPruitt you’re a genuine scumbag. why do you want hard working Americans to pay more to drive their cars? I bet it’s because you live in a house paid by oil lobbyists. you’re a terrible piece of shit, glad to know the @WhiteHouse hates America
303 2018-04-02 23:19:59 And NO... DAP was not Canadian oil. It is DAKOTA shale oil. 

"The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) or Bakken pipeline is a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline in the United States. It begins in the Bakken shale oil fields in northwest North Dakota"

309 2018-04-02 23:19:37 Yes, quite unnecessary. The British Foreign Office had been trying to get rid of the Falklands for years. Argentina has also lost the potential benefits of oil and gas exploration in the islands.

322 2018-04-02 23:18:18 It would have to be good at dissolving and then combining with immersion oil for my objective cleaning purposes. I think this might be good for removing residue left be impure solvents used for cleaning, but not for the initial cleaning of (dry) objectives with oil contamination

324 2018-04-02 23:17:49 Remember Sinclair Oil? Remember the mascot of Sinclair Oil--the brontosaurus (I even had a blow-up bronto from the chain as a kid)? The similarity in name is not the important point. But the dinosaurs are now extinct. With any luck, Sinclair Broadcasting will follow that path.
325 2018-04-02 23:17:32 Oil/gas companies have the lowest tax rate here in OK. It’s around 5% where every other state is 15% +. Hard to feel sympathy for Republican voters.
326 2018-04-02 23:17:30 Didnt the british invaded them for oil and reserves? The islands were argentines before british invasion.
327 2018-04-02 23:17:02 With your grammar, I doubt you you teach, let change oil in a car...but, thanks, honey.
328 2018-04-02 23:16:49 Bill signed raised gas prices by .03 diesel .06, increase rates on oil and gas from 2% to 5% then to 7% in 2 yrs. $1.00 per pack cigs. tax little cigars same as cigs, and increase the hotel tax by $5.00 but that was taken away. This is an awful bill that our Governor signed.
329 2018-04-02 23:16:32 Why would anyone do that? Regardless of gender? Oil isn't cheap!
330 2018-04-02 23:16:30 I don’t have stats but I bet oil workers have been making 3x the national average for years and years. Not sure how much sympathy were supposed to have.
331 2018-04-02 23:16:21 wait i don't have olive oil will it still work
332 2018-04-02 23:16:14 Never mind that oil companies may their profit off of volume. And if Oklahoma raises its taxes, another well and jobs will be shuttered to move to lower tax states.
And when teachers want more pay again, where will their raise come?

Doesn't count.

352 2018-04-02 23:12:32 No, fracking causing earthquakes is from the myth that oil lubricates the faults.
North America is atop lots of fault lines, some we’ve mapped, others surprise us.

I changed the oil to ma car, then I had to push the car to start it (the ignition gave out but good thing we have a manual car so we can just pop the clutch to start it)
THE CAR IS LIGHT BUT PUSHING FOR A LONG PERIOD AT A TIME IS HARD!
388 2018-04-02 23:08:54 Love it to look like the Lucas Oil Stadium. Still think the images we’re seeing from tonight are concepts for the forum. They’re going to be a far cry from what it’ll end up looking like. I mean, Dan said it’s a game changer and these are.. well basic

395 2018-04-02 23:07:36 So this statement agrees with the protesters.
Oil industry just like raw sewage is hazardous or toxic to the environment.
396 2018-04-02 23:07:14 The EPA rollback of car emission standards is horrible and short sighted. It shows @realDonaldTrump and Pruitt and their love affair with oil. We have a right to clean air and smart people know this is bad for climate.

401 2018-04-02 23:05:01 That world does exist. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Employers don't give raises based on just how good an employee is, they give raises on how much an employee annoys them about their pay.

I agree the system is the problem, your complaints are the employer of the teachers...
402 2018-04-02 23:04:50 The free market raised its invisible middle finger to a Fox darling, so conservatives are trying not to break eye contact for the first time.  Maybe now you'll defy the market when it's making people sick, or driving species to extinction, or spilling oil on burial grounds

409 2018-04-02 23:03:54 Most common engines don’t actually require to have synthetic, only high performance/horsepower engines do I believe. Conventional oil will do no harm to the average engine, but they say synthetic will “make it last longer”

419 2018-04-02 23:02:39 ++ This is where the rubber hits the road with us disagreeing, I am sure, but our tax rates on oil and natural gas are really low compared to national averages, and they are a sacred cow special interest here. . . 

We can either invest in ed or give tax breaks to oil.

423 2018-04-02 23:02:18 We use @HowardProducts mineral oil which is enriched with vitamin E, then finish with their butcher block wax. It’s food grade and seems to work great! Also about the music. That wasn’t intentional lol.
424 2018-04-02 23:02:07 Someone should let you in on a bit of state history - that oil well has been dry and plugged for decades...
425 2018-04-02 23:02:04 OIL DIFF: 5.03 -> 5.04
426 2018-04-02 23:01:49 New foundation to match my skin, my oil & inspection sticker changed, new bathing suit bottoms.. yeah I think that’s about it 
427 2018-04-02 23:01:22 I’m laughing... RT @LifeByCharsha: Walnut oil is good for regrowing your edges, brows and lashes ladies. It smell like fried rice but the results are amazing.
428 2018-04-02 23:01:21 Where's the sells pitch? I only had a question, here it is again... "Is Spring / Summer MR time in oil? @chigrl"
429 2018-04-02 23:00:49 It would be a win-win, plus already have southern boarder wall to Honduras, and Mexico has alot of oil...extra win
430 2018-04-02 23:00:46 Just like in fall 2013, when months after Russian incursion into Ukraine the Saudis just suddenly decided to open the taps and drive down the price of oil.
431 2018-04-02 23:00:40 All of you greenpeacers are the biggest Hippocrates in the world. Practice what you preach. I'm hoping for $3.00 gas in BC soon. I hope you all rode your bikes there. Maybe BOYCOTT Microsoft for all the oil Gates is shipping.

433 2018-04-02 23:00:11 California thinks they can stop oil drilling by taking over federal lands ; forgot SUPREMACY CLAUSE IN CONSTITUTION
434 2018-04-02 23:00:07 "nagjujump na oil"
435 2018-04-02 22:59:54 Moisturize every night in cocoa butter and coconut oil mixed, and every morning, moisturize in shea butter (a natural sunscreen). No need to thank me.  I just wanna see y’all glow
436 2018-04-02 22:59:53 My mom has a oil face and she told me if you ever forget the sheets, you can use the toilet covers :)
437 2018-04-02 22:59:42 Lmfaoooooooooo son said it look greasy!! Somebody rubbed this shit down with coconut oil bruh i would work place violence whoever “made” this shit
438 2018-04-02 22:59:36 Anyone got links to an organization or assembly, petition to join on ceasing oil drilling off the coast of South Carolina?  I think NC and Florida are safe. Do not destroy our coastlines!
439 2018-04-02 22:59:36 You'd think Israel was building an oil pipeline underneath Gaza with all that oppression and violence. #TYTLive
440 2018-04-02 22:59:29 Is this the start of the Oil Wars?
441 2018-04-02 22:59:19 MBS is moving too fast. Clearly with blessings from his father and the power players in SA. 

1. Oil may be running out faster than forecast 
2. Jihadi threats have reached the crown itself
442 2018-04-02 22:59:00 Monday night's dinner. Spaghetti con Calamari.  Al dente DeCecco Spaghetti tossed with lightly sautéed calamari in Sicilian extra virgin olive oil and garlic then mixed with Sugo di Pomodoro e Basilico.  Peperoncino. Used a jar of Passata for 1 lb of Dry spaghetti.
443 2018-04-02 22:58:50 Yeah, you know Standard Oil didn’t fare so well for a little bit either.

446 2018-04-02 22:58:24 I love it. It squeaks now but i think I gotta oil it
447 2018-04-02 22:58:21 why don’t more restaurants have vegan options i’m fucking tired as shit of eating olive oil covered noodles and whatever nasty ass vegetables they’ve had freezer burnt in the back for months
448 2018-04-02 22:57:53 Oui c’est comme l’huile de ricin qu’ils appellent castor oil !
449 2018-04-02 22:57:41 @planetmoney the dollar fell today and the price of crude oil is also declining. I thought those things typically had a strong inverse relationship. I know the economy is complex and anything can happen in a given day but why might these two indicators be tracking?
450 2018-04-02 22:57:30 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
451 2018-04-02 22:57:25 Most of this was the agency charged with not only providing permits, but also enforcing laws governing oil drilling.
452 2018-04-02 22:57:25 " Its obvious your country only wants them for its oil and other reserves...." and why do you think your country has conquered them illegally?? They were not thinking about people...
453 2018-04-02 22:57:22 I thought he said we were getting out and musing about oil.
454 2018-04-02 22:57:20 When the article you link to has a running head picture of an oil refinery ablaze that has nothing to do with #Fukushima...maybe it is time to find better information #misinformation #clickbait
455 2018-04-02 22:57:17 SMALL GOVERNMENT?? No. Profits for oil industry
456 2018-04-02 22:57:13 @MaryFallin Our corrections department really??!!! You need inmates to fill your new 800 million dollar prisons. You're in bed with the oil people and don't care about the people of Oklahoma. FUCK YOU.
457 2018-04-02 22:57:10 I really need an oil change
458 2018-04-02 22:56:56 i just got to my car and my daddy got its oil changed washed and detailed for me , he’s the best 
459 2018-04-02 22:56:50 hahaha this dude had a lil yorkie in his truck getting his oil changed and homie didn’t wanna get in the truck talkin about there’s a dog in here and then the owner pulls him out and it’s the cutest little yorkie with his hair in a ponytail lmfaooo
460 2018-04-02 22:56:42 Can you tell me how you use it? Like how many times a day/week? Cause I switched to argan oil but I still have dry patches
461 2018-04-02 22:56:07 This Cherry Pie oil tastes like sex.
462 2018-04-02 22:56:03 I think they way he sold out the people of his own state to gas and oil companies might have given us a clue about how he would behave, but honestly he seems kind of paranoid and unable to accept responsibility for his own actions.
463 2018-04-02 22:55:59 Dear Elon Musk, What if you gave every car owner in America an electric car. That would solve the gas milage problem. We’d all buy your batteries & you would really be messing with the oil companies. That would be fun, right?
Ok. Just give all the democrats electric cars 
464 2018-04-02 22:55:49 You're a dance queen. Don't forget your protein and healthy fats, a lot of vitamins and minerals don't get absorbed without them. Fry less, bake more. That doesn't mean "less oil", I'm actually for LCHF. It just means don't burn your oils, as it might produce harmful compounds.
465 2018-04-02 22:55:42 does big oil not understand when the worm turns....and it will...there will be hell to pay by the complicit folks?
466 2018-04-02 22:55:40 Unfortunately it is because WTI is dropping, more than WCS rising.  It is the "5 yr. average" of oil price spreads!
467 2018-04-02 22:55:24 No no, biggest oil discovery in Bahrain, not in the Middle East
468 2018-04-02 22:54:45 Every time I see this oil & gas industry bullshit in my feed I will post to cost you money. #polluters #corporatescum #sodoff
469 2018-04-02 22:54:45 Astoria giggled opening the bag and getting the chicken out putting into a pan with some oil and turning the cooker on she searched the pantry for sons potatoes and veggies. 

"hope everyone's hungry cause it's going to be delicious for you both I promise I'll not burn a thing."+
470 2018-04-02 22:54:39 im going to sleep with coconut oil on my face and it feels so disgusting
471 2018-04-02 22:54:37 No it didn't they forced the country (with the largest proven oil reserves) into abject poverty.

It temporarily boosted the living standards of his supporters but by taking wealth not creating it.
472 2018-04-02 22:54:30 where is so i use really i am going oil
473 2018-04-02 22:54:01 I reallt wanna play Snake Oil, also need friends to play it with
IM BAD AT BULLSHITTING THOUGH SO I WILL BE TERRIBLE
474 2018-04-02 22:54:00 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
475 2018-04-02 22:53:52 No, but it buys us time to work on alternative energy infrastructure, re-training, etc. 

In addition to which, it allows us to stop buying oil from countries whom we disagree with on things like human rights.

It's not a long-term plan; if plotted well, it's a stopgap measure.
476 2018-04-02 22:53:52 Amazon is clutch too that’s where I get mine. Is amazing as hair oil too!
477 2018-04-02 22:53:48 Didn’t get my free oil change but this guy might change my air filters ayyyy

479 2018-04-02 22:53:41 CBD Oil is going to be a billion dollar industry by 2020! Who wants in on making good money helping people & pets?
480 2018-04-02 22:53:37 Might want to look into some history of anti trust actions - Standard Oil, AT&T, Bell system, IBM, etc.
481 2018-04-02 22:53:36 He’s a real POS who only cares about enriching himself as well as his benefactors in the oil industry.
482 2018-04-02 22:53:33 Germany's butt is always to hang with the normal to make shoes help me!! Are you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
483 2018-04-02 22:53:32 Jamaican black castor oil, peppermint oil and some other one I can't remember.
484 2018-04-02 22:53:25 Hell yeah. I just get anything that will foam up as a cleanser. If I'm spending money it's on DHC oil cleanser, Natural Aqua Gel Cure for a gentle exfoliant, and moisturizers.

487 2018-04-02 22:53:17 That moment when you need to get the oil changed and you do it in an O'Reilly's auto parts store...don't make a mess. And leave the parking space spotless haha
488 2018-04-02 22:53:16 @hughhewitt @RWPUSA  Scott Pruitt Should not head the EPA, period.  Look what he did as AG in Oklahoma.  He allowed lawyers at Devon Energy Corporation a gas/oil giant, to write a three-page complaint to the EPA under his AG letterhead, which he signed and sent as his own.
489 2018-04-02 22:53:05 Skip that replace it with some other oil you like.

493 2018-04-02 22:52:22 Who puts lemon ESSENTIAL OIL in their water????  Lemon JUICE people! The oils are concentrated, very concentrated. You can over-do anything but especially the essential oils of plants #medicine #moderately #awareness #heals
494 2018-04-02 22:52:15 BOYCOTT the Birkshirehathaway/ Microsoft OIL CARTEL!!! All of the green people should take note the two companies have major plays in the oil gas industry as shippers. A few more towns blown up should get some attention. So be truely green and boycott the companies and products.
495 2018-04-02 22:52:12 I mean, Daniel Day Lewis doing the voice and crazy eyes is fun for a while, but it just feels like a film that has nothing to say apart from "oil, eh?"

500 2018-04-02 22:51:18 My rabbit got sick. My car needs gas and an oil change. I dont get paid for 2 more weeks but literally NOTHING can stop me from becoming a #MaxFunDrive donor. What's your excuse?
501 2018-04-02 22:51:14 If a recession comes to Canada, you guys are FUBAR.  Canada is walking an economic tightrope.  Interest rates, trade disputes, housing downturn, oil downturn.  Something is going to bite you.
502 2018-04-02 22:51:14 Yep Attention Pipeline Protestors. ..Just imagine shangra la  your dream come true a life without oil ... No iPhone no iPads no running shoes no heat no electricity no Starbucks no fast food no slow food ahh yep no oil the ultimate no tide pods
503 2018-04-02 22:51:12 China is into dictatorship, Russia will joint a oil agreement with Saudi Arabia, CNN is still busy doing divide this country! Nice job CNN, nice!
504 2018-04-02 22:51:07 Layoffs, closings, jobs are down. Yes, Russia is taking our oil. We knew they would.
505 2018-04-02 22:50:51 My oil pan all types of messed up too 
506 2018-04-02 22:50:47 I wish someone would have brought up the fact that Pruitt took a taxpayer-funded trip to Morocco for the same Lobbyist that rents him a "room" in D.C. Pruitt is EPA, NOT oil & gas industry. @RWPUSA @SRuhle @hughhewitt
507 2018-04-02 22:50:20 got my oil changed after years 
508 2018-04-02 22:50:15 The point is there is no proven link between US big oil, US big enviro foundations and Canadian enviros. If you're pushing that conspiracy theory you're as wacky as Crause.
509 2018-04-02 22:49:54 えっ、クソ謎事案
510 2018-04-02 22:49:49 Honda Civic! best car I’ve ever had! such good gas mileage and as long as you keep up with oil changes they run like a dream.
511 2018-04-02 22:49:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
512 2018-04-02 22:49:07 As always, the truth lies in the middle.

We may not like it, but we need oil still, and I'd much rather we didn't buy it from places like Saudi Arabia.

One day, we can wean ourselves off of our dependence on fossil fuels; in the meantime, we should carefully use what we have.
513 2018-04-02 22:49:05 I’ve been using the Neutrogena Hydroboost cleansing gel recently. I remove makeup with the Simple cleansing oil then use the gel with my Clarisonic. The MUAC Pomegranate and Green Tea face wash is also excellent.  I use the toner in that line to remove the last of my makeup.

515 2018-04-02 22:48:57 Not really. If you'd been paying attention, you'd know that the EPA was hollowed out and corrupted many years ago. They're in the pocket of Big Oil and other Corporate Iinterests.
516 2018-04-02 22:48:39 It annoys me on how shitty our state representatives are. They're all money towards oil and that's not doing too hot either. Complete scumbags
517 2018-04-02 22:48:36 @HughHewitt Ryan Zinke has lobbyists & Industry Reps calling the shots at Interior. TeaPot Dome has nothing on him. Pruitt is the oil,gas,pesticide darling, Menuhin can fly on his golden chariots at our expense & you don’t see corruption? #November2018 Shame

525 2018-04-02 22:47:10 I didn’t do primrose oil but tried to have sex every day (same idea) and I think it helped me progress from a 2 last week to a 4 this week! Looking back I wish I had taken primrose oil bc my husband is tired a lot and wasn’t always in the mood lol
526 2018-04-02 22:46:56 i love the smell of cooked sesame oil
527 2018-04-02 22:46:54 Some got gold and oil and diamonds, all we've got is Mary Jane.
528 2018-04-02 22:46:30 Crude oil prices fell about 3% today to $63 a barrel. Wonder if we’ll see a drop at the pumps?  Funny, when oil goes up we see a price increase almost immediately but when it goes down it takes about 3 weeks to lower gas prices. See how that works?  What a racket.
529 2018-04-02 22:46:26 Whether we accept it or not, oil will soon be obsolete sha, plus renewable energy is coming to stay (forever) so there's that also.
530 2018-04-02 22:46:26 @hughhewitt is a slick talking conservative snake oil salesman. Secretary Pruitt is an ethical nightmare, and Mr. Hewitt knows it. @RWPUSA knows what he is talking about. @SRuhle

532 2018-04-02 22:46:07 I think the oil is supposed to go in the car, but when you have a body like that who cares where it goes.

537 2018-04-02 22:45:36 "Big oil" doesn't have anything to do with this.....this was requested by motor vehicle manufacturers who changed their position from the time when President Obama pushed these GHG emission standards and CAFE improvements through.
538 2018-04-02 22:45:27 So a truck come and puts oil in a tank at your house? And you buy it by the gallon?
539 2018-04-02 22:45:19 thanks - appreciate this change (ie no longer using palm oil), and the quick response.
540 2018-04-02 22:44:56 This is a favor for their Saudi friends. Keep that sweet sweet crude flowing for another decade. Billions and billions to be made before oil goes out of vogue.
541 2018-04-02 22:44:54 Join us @MarriottPitts (Pittsburgh Marriott North) for a summer event focused on Pennsylvania Oil & Gas law practice. Reserve your seat now.
542 2018-04-02 22:44:44 same way that some motor oil brands in XV are called Junon and Pyrefly. There are also a huge amount of references (Eiko, YRP, among others) within Insomnia, though most of those signs aren't connected to any material product within the game.
543 2018-04-02 22:44:39 Big oil is taxed at 3.2% in Oklahoma
8.3% in Texas
12% in Arkansas
13.3% in Louisiana 
Raise that 3.2% to a nice round 8% and everything teacher/classroom gets better, and still leaves us at the lowest tax rate for oil vs our neighbors
544 2018-04-02 22:44:37 mix rice instead of fried rice, its a special order where the cook mix the rice with few drops of oil, a bit salt an pepper and wallaa you get what we called nowadays 'nasi goreng biasa, kurang minyak x nak msg'
545 2018-04-02 22:44:18 The second piece is if CA starts exporting fruit to the Midwest during winter what would be the export tax or tariffs since CA can impose it has its own oil, seaport and various international airports 
546 2018-04-02 22:44:11 No oh...that's not true. U see what oil marketers did to us in December, if it were a socialist economy that wouldn't have happened. Pros and cons
547 2018-04-02 22:43:58 When all the oil and gas are extracted wherever they are being mined.What happens to the space left behind.

549 2018-04-02 22:43:35 For a couple of the richest people in the world that preach about health care, sure are Hippocrates. I think wheat is more important than hauling oil. The two have cornered the shipping market after lobbying against pipelines. Pipelines are proven to be the safest.

561 2018-04-02 22:41:16 Oh, sure. You don´t  want the oil ... you´re so nice ... You are and will always be pirates. Colonizing lands thousands of miles from your  small and "always" gray island. Please read history sir and learn a little.

566 2018-04-02 22:40:27 Serious answer—some Eastern European oil billionaire bought every table @ Tao Beach multiple bottles a couple of yrs ago.Waitress came to our cabana w/ a bottle of Grey Goose, Cristal, & Patron & told us it was on some dude named "Joey." She said it's normal for him to drop 750K.
567 2018-04-02 22:40:24 1000 liters = 264 US gallons = 6 barrels, therefore 1000 liter fuel spill sounds pretty bad but is only about the fuel capacity of a tractor trailor, never great but we can take it from there for proportions; free range bobbing oil pumps average 15 liters per stroke

574 2018-04-02 22:40:00 Actually if you’re oily, it’s typically because your face is dehydrated; so using oils actually tricks your body into slowing down the oil production. I was 100% oily, started using Tatcha oil at night and my face is so much better off. I don’t look greasy ever anymore.
575 2018-04-02 22:39:59 Name one pipeline that was protested in the U.S. by professional engo's that wasn't oil coming from Canada.
576 2018-04-02 22:39:44 I can list just one. Oil. Obama by depressing the price of oil was the single most crippling thing done to Russia. Rosneft which was a piggy bank for Putin and his oligarchs has been crippled with oil ppb being halved. That along with the sanctioning of Putin’s.....
577 2018-04-02 22:39:42 LRT:

Never had a colonoscopy before, but I did get my oil checked once.

I proposed to the nurse immediately, and she laughed it off. I was serious.

Katie, if you’re out there, my love remains true.
578 2018-04-02 22:39:11 So,  I guess the Hydraulic Oil,  didn't work?
579 2018-04-02 22:39:07 My question is why are we exporting most of our oil ? Why do we not build more refineries in say BC so we do not have to pay the high cost ?
580 2018-04-02 22:39:01 Yea you’re not supposed to use coconut oil on your face  it does more harm than good tbh.
581 2018-04-02 22:39:00 The Clean & Clear oil absorbing ones! But whenever I can find the knock off brand of those ones I get them bc they work just as good :)
582 2018-04-02 22:38:55 China also needs to provide oil to citizens to keep them moving. If not?

584 2018-04-02 22:38:38 Shame on you, Oklahoma, putting your teachers and your kids' educations after "other considerations," when there is an oil well sitting in front of your capital building. Very sad priorities! #oklahomateacherwalkout
585 2018-04-02 22:38:30 Yes!! I LOVE using tea tree oil. Especially on acne that’s open. It really helps reduce redness and clear it out
586 2018-04-02 22:38:22 Need new tires :( need a new battery :( just got an oil change :( considering setting my car on fire at this point bc that’s what it’s doing to my bank account :(
587 2018-04-02 22:38:11 @theoilprice It's hardly a coincidence that America has doubled it's oil production & sales of crude oil while #OPEC countries along with #Canada #Russia #Venezuela #Libya & other producing countries are all having troubles selling their oil & production has been cut in half.
588 2018-04-02 22:37:48 The requirements should be greater. No need for an 18mpg vehicle when it could be doubled with ease. Just smart for the environment. Oil will time out within the next 30 years
589 2018-04-02 22:37:48 Why in the heck would anyone, other than oil companies, feel this is a good thing to do? Automobile makers are on track to meet these guidelines.
590 2018-04-02 22:37:43 @EPAScottPruitt  When he was AG of Oklahoma, allowed lawyers at Devon Energy Corporation, an oil and gas giant, to write a three-page complaint to the EPA under his Letterhead which he signed and sent as his own.  He should never have been confirmed.
591 2018-04-02 22:37:40 Exactly!!  Oil companies don’t get subsidies.
592 2018-04-02 22:37:32 it’s funny that iraq was gonna stop oil to the usa then all of a sudden they had wmd which turned out they were none
593 2018-04-02 22:37:31 This beard oil I bought from the beauty supply
594 2018-04-02 22:37:28 Absolutely! And of course destroying the skin's protective layer or dehydrating the skin can cause more oil production, so I'd almost argue it's more important for oily/combo skin.
595 2018-04-02 22:37:12 There's oil money & there's roubles, City & Chelsea, the rest of the PL are pretty much run similar to Spurs, operating within their means.
596 2018-04-02 22:37:06 The West could just over produce oil and gas and flood the market, driving the market price of oil below 40.00 puts the Russian economy in serious, serious, financial trouble.
597 2018-04-02 22:37:05 "Centuries" were primarily talking about commodities in general. China needs more of everything in order to produce products. Just like US. I think China oil contract will put them in the position of giving up their gold.
598 2018-04-02 22:37:03 Stop buying foreign oil ! Canada first !
599 2018-04-02 22:37:00 Full tank of gas, car washed, oil changed, storage paid. I call today a productive day.
600 2018-04-02 22:36:59 And the baking oil!
601 2018-04-02 22:36:46 Tried to be productive and change the oil in mom's jeep, but I stripped the drain plug bolt instead and now idk if it will come off. Fuck!

603 2018-04-02 22:36:34 I wondered who might be the first to mention it. That's average for this oil change, so it includes winter time warm up / idling, in a pickup truck.
604 2018-04-02 22:36:33 honey apply ur lipbalm, coat ur lashes with castor oil, spray ur face with rose water, drink water, eat ur fruits and veggies, and love urself
605 2018-04-02 22:36:28 Tweeps, another request - who is tracking First Nations and Metis legal actions related to oil sands?  Is there an up-to-date annotated list? Including lawsuits related to companies, govts and pipelines? @ErielTD? @reporteremma? @ghoberg?
606 2018-04-02 22:36:19 
607 2018-04-02 22:36:12 And the monthly bill for the heating oil arrived. $0. helps make up for how expensive March was. not the oil in March, that's the same every month but all around expensive.
608 2018-04-02 22:35:50 Oil change, check.....groceries, check.....laundry, check.....bathing dogs????? Maybe today
609 2018-04-02 22:35:39 nooo, i’m talking about oil cleanser + water based cleanser. although that does serve the same purpose

625 2018-04-02 22:32:01 Canadian taxpayers spent $13M on CRA audits to corroborate this theory, & got zip.

It’s time to take enviros at their word that their priority really is stopping climate change, not helping US oil.
626 2018-04-02 22:31:59 Conspiracy theorists like me believe they are giving Coconut Oil Kapler time to rest his pitchers.
627 2018-04-02 22:31:56 Right, so you need to dry them first. Then warm some oil, add the dried chillies, not too hot as you don't want to cook them, stir about, add more oil, warm through them allow to cool.
628 2018-04-02 22:31:53 Start with a dry face. Massage the oil in for a few minutes (you can do it up to 10-15, but no one ever really has time for that.)
To remove: you can use a warm damp towel or slowly add water & cleanser to your face & wash it off that way
629 2018-04-02 22:31:46 They say the invasion of Iraq was for oil, so I can't understand their logic of "we kill you for your oil". Nations make trades you buy oil we buy goods.
630 2018-04-02 22:31:46 Seattle, @CMMikeOBrien notes, has committed to dramatically reducing its climate impact; that includes not just protesting oil rigs and pipelines but making hard decisions that impact people in Seattle directly.
631 2018-04-02 22:31:34 Of course he does he`s got Oil and Gas Billionairs to keep happy......
632 2018-04-02 22:31:34 You know I haven’t done shit at work when I barely find out that my oil bucket is missing and it’s 4 
633 2018-04-02 22:31:33 “may have” what kind of advocacy work are you doing? Lol who cares? Stop urging people to side with oil. It’s bad for us.

635 2018-04-02 22:31:24 Oh, yeah, and buy oil by the truckload, you'll need to change it add to it all the time.  And fiberglass protectant after every use, seat cover protectors, well, you get the idea  LOL  AND, you'll have a boat load of fun with the age your children are.  Pricele$$ memories.
636 2018-04-02 22:31:15 I had a bottle of straight up jajoba oil and it felt like I had a jerry curl hours later running my hands through my beard.

638 2018-04-02 22:31:12 This works, actually. You just have to find the right oil for your skin type. I’m oily skinned and I double cleanse with a cleansing oil at night to remove all makeup and have used certain oils and serums with oils to excellent effect (NOT coconut oil, though).

651 2018-04-02 22:28:55 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

654 2018-04-02 22:28:10 .@EPAScottPruitt’s decision to roll back fuel economy standards is a victory for big oil and major corporations at the expense of American consumers and clean air for our kids.
655 2018-04-02 22:28:05 no..not in centuries, China has been buying oil since it was at 70 (brent) they don't like high oil prices, they will use this contract to sink it
656 2018-04-02 22:28:04 I make a mix of beeswax, Vegetable Oil and a bit of honey as a balm for dry lips and it is great on dry fingertips,  inflamed cuticles etc., too. Maybe it is possible to buy lanolin and then try a mixture with oil/beeswax? Just not too much heat on a stove, better in a water bath

661 2018-04-02 22:27:08 The thing is that this won't increase auto manufacturers profits. They'd have to redesign engines & retool factories with tech that is over 20 yrs. old. That costs a lot $$ & Big Oil's not going to give it to them.

706 2018-04-02 22:20:28 That is true.  My comment was more directed at Utah who is trying to force the return of public lands.   However, CA does have say so on how public lands are used when it comes to issues such as oil drilling and mining.
707 2018-04-02 22:20:20 I could go on & on Jacquie, BTW 2 of the biggest oil field ever discovered in Scottish waters were discovered in a new field west of the Shetland isle last year.
708 2018-04-02 22:20:16 How many tax breaks your state gov give the oil industry? Why? They can't take it anywhere. It's in the ground. Maybe they bought somebody.
709 2018-04-02 22:20:13 He and @realDonaldTrump love Oil Oligarchs here and abroad.  Hell, they probably even stand behind the Pig Harold Hamm and bid to stop the OK teachers raises.  Oligarchs are running this country.  Call for a sell off of @ContinentalOil stocks and make them poor.

718 2018-04-02 22:19:25 #beard oil is an absolute con. Beard hair is pretty much the same as pube hair, I've never oiled my pubes and they are glorious.
719 2018-04-02 22:19:24 It is incredibly easy to prove that what comes out of tail pipes is poisonous. So all the city has to do is start arresting people for spreading poison. fighting climate change like they did will be oil companies worst nightmare.

736 2018-04-02 22:17:41 The National Parks belong to the people, leave the animals there alone, keep the oil companies out of there & just because you cut billions of tax revenues from the top 1% doesn’t give you the right to raise entry fees.

738 2018-04-02 22:17:21 Skip the castor. Go sunflower, hemp & 3 drops of tea tree (test on your inner elbow or behind ear). 

You can also just start with 1 oil (sunflower) and then add & mix as you get more familiar

750 2018-04-02 22:16:05 The person who said to breathe in steam has the right idea. Add menthol, Vicks, olbas oil,  eucalyptus or tea tree oil for added benefit but even just steam will sort you out. Kettle, big bowl, tent made from a towel over your head and the bowl. Job done.
751 2018-04-02 22:16:02 You can pan fry chickpeas so they stay together. It just takes some oil because unlike beef they don’t come with their own fat. Drain them well (on a paper towel even) season them, then add them to a few tablespoons of hot oil and they’ll get crispier

756 2018-04-02 22:14:55 I know! I think we can tackle the energy part of the equation, especially in country like NZ, and that electricity can cover a lo of our present oil usage. 

OTOH, the plastic issue just seems overwhelming...

759 2018-04-02 22:14:38 As well Norway's modern manufacturing and welfare system rely on a financial reserve produced by exploitation of natural resources particularly North Sea oil. 
Our biggest export is money. Our currency is the world currency. If that changes. It's over. (2)

761 2018-04-02 22:14:08 Our oil and gas has not ever come from Russia.

764 2018-04-02 22:13:37 Actually none. I use an olive oil cream after I shower and a leave in conditioner as needed. But no sprays or gels.
765 2018-04-02 22:13:21 The trump tariff on solar was to slow down renewables creating less assistance in the climate accord to take the pressure off of fossil fuel for trump & putins profit in a huge oil scam !?!

768 2018-04-02 22:13:02 The reason why marijuana is forbidden is because it is a threat to the chemical, oil, pharmaceutical and paper industries among other imperialist reasons. Governments forbid it because of expanding awareness, people with an own mind are dangerous to their absolutists agenda.

Even GEJ didn't pay most Federal workers in December 2014 for Xmas. By September 2014 Federal Government was borrowing to pay salaries, oil slumped in July
776 2018-04-02 22:11:40 Geez the amount of time these people take for a simple oil change is ridiculous

782 2018-04-02 22:11:20 Pay attention:

Scott Pruitt, head of the EPA and known for siding with -and taking cash from- big oil and coal industries, is now lowering the standard of fuel efficiency in vehicles. Head of the EPA and you want us to use MORE FUEL? Bought by oilers much?

791 2018-04-02 22:10:37 Good thing president Trump took decisive action against Russia. He squeezed them tremendously by fully supporting the oil and gas industry and approving key Pipelines, he has built up our military and funded it properly, and he just expelled over 60 diplomats, the most in history

Most of them agree that the Ottoman caliphate was better for them than what they’ve got now: dominion by Western secular democracies for oil and cheap labor. Under the Turks, they would never be treated by the West as now.

804 2018-04-02 22:08:50 That's my main beef with the "transition" between oil & gas and renewables: a fundamental problem is that a really slow transition clearly benefits some specific actors.

817 2018-04-02 22:07:37 Yep, there's this feeling that some countries are more comfortable supporting traditional options (oil & gas) than investing in emerging ones (but hey, I'm not an insider, so I don't really know I guess).

You use a leave in, oil and a curling cream. This is perfect for twist out and other styles like that. Do this on wash day, wash and go or cowash. This keeps hair styled for about a week. I suggest 3 days of fro and 2 days of ponytail retwist over the weekend

835 2018-04-02 22:05:47 #dacccoll This is a very sad article. The future shouldn't be based on oil corporations, but rather on the future of the next generations. It's mind blowing to see people with doctorate degrees and masters make the income of a person with a bachelor's.  This needs attention.

843 2018-04-02 22:05:19 Yes, they are. Thanks for the GIF. I think it will be tough to coax people out of their cars though. The movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the sad tale of the demise of the LA street car system. Big oil  been screwing the country for a long time. It’s also about cartoons.

868 2018-04-02 22:02:36 It seems the continuous exclusion of importers of crude palm oil from accessing the foreign exchange at the official window has led to price increases in local rubber and crude palm oil.  This has led to significant gains for Okomu Oil Palm.
869 2018-04-02 22:02:33 Taxes will be one of Muellers charges I'm sure. Just think the decades of the Saudis buying American Companies through multi ways. They could crush the market if they want. They know oil is limited so they bought the U.S.A. Companies. Why not we are Selling Them.

916 2018-04-02 21:57:54 Yes I guess. But maybe simpler than that. I’m just making sure I don’t buy a kilo of steak or use a cup of olive oil because I’m being careless.

925 2018-04-02 21:56:34 Of course not. This car also has brake pads at 2mm remaining front and rear and rotors are also shot. The oil cooler leaks pretty bad too. Fancy car, fancy bill.
926 2018-04-02 21:56:27 I have a blessed bidaar. I use coconut oil to salaax the bidaar. I also eat alot of hilib ari which helps trigger my bidaar pores which allows my bidaar to shine during the summer.
927 2018-04-02 21:56:15 So Oklahoma can sell more fracked oil.

936 2018-04-02 21:55:40 China's selling of treasuries, creation of a non-dollar oil currency, purchases of gold and natural resources will help to put the nails in the US coffin. Navarro will come up with some lame explanation of what happened and create more messes.

941 2018-04-02 21:55:13 I think my life would be very different if I could afford to take CBD oil every day. The days I get to use it I always end up shocked at how not-terrible I feel.
942 2018-04-02 21:55:08 That is irrelevant because there are major American oil interests (refiners and rail companies) that benefit tremendously from our land-locked crude, which is the argument not addressed in the article
943 2018-04-02 21:55:06 wait or do u mean cooking oil
944 2018-04-02 21:54:57 The Bitumen deposit in Ondo State is the 2nd largest in the world after Venuezala, &we have 4 Bitumen bearing states in Nigeria, of which 3(Ondo, Ogun&Lagos) are in the S/W, yet, we are all fixed on oil proceeds mostly from S/S! God pls help us think straight.

948 2018-04-02 21:54:25 @EPAScottPruitt @ActualEPAFacts 
increased regs have drove fuel efficient tech/spurred renewal of electric/hybrids. 

Is your aim to have less efficient and more expensive tech for Americans, less competitive in the global market and worse on the environment? 

Or just oil $$$$$?
949 2018-04-02 21:54:24 In other words, "please don't cut back on using fuel because our oil tycoon buddies don't like that".
Oh, and "screw the future generations because I'm living large and that's all that matters".
950 2018-04-02 21:54:23 I mean I tip my hat off to you. You are going up against big oil and whatever media conglomerates they have their tentancle around.

953 2018-04-02 21:54:08 Droids gotta stay away from the oil.
954 2018-04-02 21:53:35 Cheap oil won't last long. US companies need to be in position to deal with that reality. Or the Japanese and Koreans will put them out of business.
955 2018-04-02 21:53:14 Uh. California can do WTF they want to about their own air quality you EPA oil loving ecotards!
956 2018-04-02 21:53:09 Oil

961 2018-04-02 21:52:29 I agree Saudis are abhorrent in rights abuses. But, because of their immense wealth & oil reserves, we like the US have no choice but to deal with them. Harper sold our Wheat Board to them. Again another fact you are ignoring.
962 2018-04-02 21:52:25 Olive oil. Best bet!!
963 2018-04-02 21:52:12 and perhaps noting that 70% of the oil sands production is from Canadian companies and 10% from a "Canadian headquartered" company (70% foreign 30% Canadian owned). So when you say "shifting...somewhat" you mean from 29% to greater than 70% - others might say that was a lot 1/
964 2018-04-02 21:52:10 Aw fuck I think I put to much MCT oil in my shake 
965 2018-04-02 21:52:07 'Can't say anything about you. But tax breaks for most & for corps pay raises & bonuses, stock market mostly up, jobs jobs jobs, we now export oil, consumer confidence up, unemployment down. &the Socialists are screaming, "Russian collusion!" Well if true we need more COLLUSION!
966 2018-04-02 21:51:59 As @politicalham has pointed out at length, US oil & gas does not compete with the oilsands.

The idea that the world’s most influential environmentalists oppose Kinder Morgan because they secretly want to benefit US Big Oil makes zero sense.
967 2018-04-02 21:51:58 oooo where did you get the growth oil from?
968 2018-04-02 21:51:53 Olbas Oil in a bowl of boiling water, towel over head to keep the steam and vapours inside, breathe deeply
969 2018-04-02 21:51:46 Agreed.  It's not oil by pipeline or rail--it's neither.

973 2018-04-02 21:51:04 As an idiot in oil, wanted to know your opinion on why crude sank mid day (as if you were talking to a golden retriever). Either way I love your insight!
974 2018-04-02 21:50:44 We must fight against the EPA rollbacks it’s bad for American, bad for fossil fuel consumption, turns back the clock for automotive manufacturers to produce cars that require more fuel..... oh ya great for oil companies.

976 2018-04-02 21:50:33 Possession is undeniably illegal. People getting away with possession doesn't magically make it legal, it means identification and enforcement is poor, which is what the pro gun side continually argues.
977 2018-04-02 21:50:12 Teachers are using their power to survive: The Oklahoma Senate has passed a bill to raise taxes on items like cigarettes and oil to raise pay for the states’ teachers, avoiding a statewide teachers strike over low wages. BRAVO! #VoteThemOut

980 2018-04-02 21:49:43 Being an adult and finally getting my car’s oil changed 
981 2018-04-02 21:49:42 He didn't design the Lucas oil and the 2 tier end is a disaster . Just my opinion but I can't see what's unique about this stadium
982 2018-04-02 21:49:42 Sparkly body oil I’m guessing
983 2018-04-02 21:49:37 If he doesn’t do the basics like fix my car and change my oil, he’s probably not a prospect.
984 2018-04-02 21:49:36 I need to learn to change my own oil because getting it changed while awkwardly listening to mechanics talk is uncomfortable.
985 2018-04-02 21:49:35 word 2 tha wise
if you have nipple rings and you decide to get fucc’d up and nakedly roll around in coconut oil.... tape those fuckers down....
986 2018-04-02 21:49:25 The white mechanic who is changing my oil today just asked me if I speak English Ok.... 
987 2018-04-02 21:49:24 Godspeed, Oil God.
988 2018-04-02 21:49:18 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
989 2018-04-02 21:49:07 This why ion come to Walmart to get my oil changed because they take too fucking long  should’ve just taken my ass to delta sonic but I wanna be lazy 
990 2018-04-02 21:49:07 Matzoh is made of flour and water, so it doesn't have that much flavor. You can get matzoh crackers with spices though. And we eat a lot of food made with ground up matzoh, oil, and eggs.
991 2018-04-02 21:48:58 Trump coming to JA after oil discovery is like these bitches that will finally text me back when i make money
992 2018-04-02 21:48:51 Now you are on truly slippery ground. 
Hmm, made me think... do you think olive oil will become more expensive after glorious #brexitshambles
993 2018-04-02 21:48:38 Joeys telling me "omg Celeste and Zoe bought a while new bottle of oil and left it here!!! Thats so noce of them i cant believe it" And im all like bitch i fucking bought that one month ago because you used all of mine

997 2018-04-02 21:48:04 You spilled oil that you slipped on and bust your head. Move.
998 2018-04-02 21:48:00 #CleanerCars standards are reducing oil dependence, saving us money and reducing pollution. 

We can’t let @EPAScottPruitt put us in reverse.
999 2018-04-02 21:47:52 I don’t know, I’ve read that immortality and oil paintings don’t mix well...
1000 2018-04-02 21:47:49 @andygoldstein05 100% right Andy it was a terribly boring fight. The fight before AJ with Russian and British fellow what a knock out #AJParker
1001 2018-04-02 21:47:31 you can get chocolate without soy in them but they can be really hard to find. I eat soy so I don't mind that even tho I don't eat chocolate. a huge amount of foods have palm oil in it and I can't go there. never touching that.
1002 2018-04-02 21:47:30 I gotta take my baby to get its first oil change tomorrow 
1003 2018-04-02 21:47:30 Hey, the Russians export lots of oil. Surely a coincidence. Right?
1004 2018-04-02 21:46:59 its never wrong to have oil in the lamp, we shall allways be prepared
1005 2018-04-02 21:46:56 Best thing I ever did!! You will look a wee bit kooky for a couple weeks as the pigment oxides but it will be 100% worth it!  After the dry healing I recommend light coconut oil
1006 2018-04-02 21:46:49 My lab group is working on creating drugs that could literally cure some cancers one day. We are cramped in the jankiest old labs in Science B with terrible equipment and broken glassware. No oil and gas interest = no money
1007 2018-04-02 21:46:48 Just pop someone in the head, say oops we were just playing around or I was trying to clean it, throw a rag and cleaning oil on a table, etc and it's a #GunFAIL where charges are rarely pressed.
1008 2018-04-02 21:46:42 If you cannot handle me at my distressingly large nightmare oil paintings, you don't deserve me at my homoerotic triptychs.
1009 2018-04-02 21:46:39 Also Trump is siding with big oil against big auto who have already planned to meet those standards and will have to anyway in CA #MoronsAreGoverningAmerica
1010 2018-04-02 21:46:33 When mine got blocked with wax I was told to soften the wax with olive oil (applied via cotton bud, then keep your head sideways for a few mins). Did that a couple of times a day for a few then had them syringed.
1011 2018-04-02 21:46:32 Clients in #China also concerned about a steeper trajectory of #FOMC rate hikes; a surge in oil prices to levels above $80/bbl; and a bear market in equity and credit markets: StanChart's Eric Robertsen
1012 2018-04-02 21:46:17 All you want, I wish I could get someone maintain my car for me - oil change, tire rotations, all with Whole Foods bags.
1013 2018-04-02 21:46:16 To remain competitive, Alberta's oil sector had to lower production costs and that meant increasing efficiencies which is, by definition, 'doing more with less'. Plain and simple. But what will those who don't return to the oilfield do? Perhaps they'll start new tech companies.
1014 2018-04-02 21:46:16 I got two jugs of the most authentic lavender oil you can find on the market. Hmu if you need some flame oil 20 dollar ounces this week only!

1017 2018-04-02 21:45:54 It was, but I have a hard time squaring Zulauf’s Dollar bullishness with the CNY-Oil developments and the work that folks like @LukeGromen and @tfmetals have been doing. The parallel Sino-Russian oil network seems like a sea-change that everyone is missing.

1022 2018-04-02 21:45:00 There is a vast salary chasm between an attorney and an Oklahoma school teacher. Pushing teachers toward poverty is what you do when you want a poor economy. If it were not for the accident of oil, Oklahoma would be Mississippi.
1023 2018-04-02 21:44:50 Thankfully I’m in my hometown to vote in tomorrow’s #CA special election. Doing my homework and saw that @JesseForASM45 took $8,000 from an oil company. Think I’m going to pass and go with #AnkurPatel who opposes #fracking in #AlisoCanyon. #CAspecialelection @NPR @CAdemocrats
1024 2018-04-02 21:44:48 The shower after laying out where you wash the oil off and are tan is the best shower
1025 2018-04-02 21:44:44 Us used pkk and isis for controlling oil fields in syria. US is the biggest terrorist ever!
1026 2018-04-02 21:44:40 Gallagher bleeds red blue and white but I think he'd be such a PHENOMINAL addition to the oil. Never see him give less than 110 percent. Marchand however... Pass.

1028 2018-04-02 21:44:12 I won't even lie, I'm bitter as oil. If you don't ask for forgiveness, I won't forgive you.

1033 2018-04-02 21:43:34 Sent you a Step by Step DM on how to make Fried Chicken the long (but very easy) way. @maglin2 

Once you do it that way once or twice you will know how to cook fried chicken. The "HEAT" is the key....start on very high for oil and then go to medium for cooking. See DM 4 tips
1034 2018-04-02 21:43:24 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
1035 2018-04-02 21:43:12 Oil rigs are freaking creepy!!
1036 2018-04-02 21:43:08 As C.B.D Oil saves more lives every day I hope to god you all begin to realize how insane the war on drugs is and anyone who supports or enforces it.
These people are the problem and causing pain and harm to so many normal people who deserve to be left alone.
1037 2018-04-02 21:43:01 Good handwriting for a little one....
And what a smart kid to know about oil and guns as a priority
1038 2018-04-02 21:42:56 Remember that time Rodney replaced everybody’s lube with chicken oil? Damnit Rodney.

Make up anything about Rodney and he will turn it into fact
1039 2018-04-02 21:42:55 All's well that ends well.
Also, inspired by streams, decided to try painting Widow (oil on blackened canvas). Will post you the result when its done.
1040 2018-04-02 21:42:53 What is happening in South Africa is terrible Wrong but Worst is the GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa for oil by British govt and their jihadists.Let us solve both based on TRUTH.
1041 2018-04-02 21:42:53 All the dark words pouring from my throat
Sound like an oil slick coating the wings we’ve grown
1042 2018-04-02 21:42:51 South South states can be our oil and gas "industrial complex", the North can thrive on mostly agriculture and solid minerals while we use the proceeds to build our educational, health and infrastructural system now to secure the future of generations yet unborn.
1043 2018-04-02 21:42:42 Tomorrow it could be olive oil 
1044 2018-04-02 21:42:37 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1045 2018-04-02 21:42:36 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1046 2018-04-02 21:42:33 Youre being fooled by a snake oil salesman. He’s playing a character and playing you in the process.
1047 2018-04-02 21:42:17 Do u clean ur ear with ear buds? If so u may be impacted your ear wax and they need syringing. 
Perhaps buy some olive oil ear drops warm it and insert and book an appt with ur practice nurse. 

If u feel dizzy could be inner ear / larbrynthitis.

1061 2018-04-02 21:41:20 Today’s decision by the EPA to weaken vehicle emissions standards is another example of the Trump Administration siding with big oil at the expense of the American people. In this country, we have a right to breathe clean air. We will keep fighting for that right.
1062 2018-04-02 21:41:19 Except it applies to all domestic violence charges. Your issue is a state one regarding state definitions of DV.

GCA applied to felonies.

Lautenberg applies to misdemeanor.

DV convicts are prohibited possessors. They cannot own and are breaking the law if they do.

1066 2018-04-02 21:40:54 Trump's "talent" is conning  gullible ignorant predominently white Americans who are receptive to his bigotted racist rhetoric. He's a narcissistic snake oil salesman deeply racist who hated a black man manifestly superior to him & tapped into that sentiment in Tea Party America

1085 2018-04-02 21:38:21 He’ll have to sell a whole bunch more of his snake oil to cover that
1086 2018-04-02 21:38:20 In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has.

1088 2018-04-02 21:37:57 For soup, cook minced onion in oil, then simmer with pork, rosemary, mushroom broth and mushrooms. Top with parmesan.
1089 2018-04-02 21:37:53 This article sends me mad. I have hundreds of customers and it happened twice and with oil it does not even stop the boiler just makes a bit of a mess! We should all be praised for how many people we got warm again over the phone to , for FREE!!
1090 2018-04-02 21:37:51 How much drilling has happened in the region?  Also, Argentina had a treaty that would have given them a share of the oil profits.  Kirchner tore it it up because he demanded the British enter talks about the region.  So instead of getting something  you get nothing.
1091 2018-04-02 21:37:46 You can do it with just a drizzle of olive oil and no butter. Just as good.
1092 2018-04-02 21:37:19 @jerome_corsi I take 1 tablespoon of cold pressed organic coconut oil in my coffee with some almond milk every day.  It will help you from getting a cold or the flu. If you do get sick, it will greatly minimize the symptoms. Take care and God Bless you and everything you do.

1096 2018-04-02 21:37:13 Yeah we don't quite have the same resources as the oil & gas sector  spreading misleading info.

Plus mainstream media owned basically by their owners so they have not been helpful either. The opposite mostly.

Plus many policy makers r frn that grp or pander 2them eg Harper
1097 2018-04-02 21:37:02 @JulesJordan Hey Jules is there another Oil overload movie in the works!? I hope to dear god there is!
1098 2018-04-02 21:36:57 My grandmother always said use 3/4 cup of olive oil for every cup of butter if ur out
1099 2018-04-02 21:36:55 Thats why they want to overturn.  Trumps friends in oil are not making enough money.  The Country is screwed and the end is near.

1103 2018-04-02 21:36:24 @RepCicilline Please stop oil drilling on our coast. The CRAZY in the WH just said it was ok----what a disaster that could be.  Also we need to stop channel 10 in Providence from putting their Sinclair propaganda out there.
1104 2018-04-02 21:36:15 Put coconut oil in my hair to leave in for the da and it’s making my head cold. 
1105 2018-04-02 21:36:00 How about because oil is an internationally traded commodity that no single (or even group) of governments can fully control because too many different gov'ts with differing governmental systems have a stake in it
1106 2018-04-02 21:36:00 You like the oil though you said
1107 2018-04-02 21:35:56 So now it’s the Oil & Gas & Auto industry lobbyists turn

1115 2018-04-02 21:34:58 No.

Cuz your electric car used lots of oil to be produced up front.

And your charging it uses some fossil fuel in the mix. Or at least in the panels used to charge it with.
1116 2018-04-02 21:34:35 Update: it's been an hour and they've looked at everything BUT the oil. I also have about $1000 worth of "problems."

1118 2018-04-02 21:34:07 Personally I mostly alternate between cooking everything in either a bunch of grass fed butter and garlic or bacon grease. However avocado and peanut oil are both excellent choices
1119 2018-04-02 21:33:55 Is he also going to ease the subsidies and tax breaks that go to the oil and fuel industries so there is insensitive to look at the alternatives?
1120 2018-04-02 21:33:36 my vegetables were dripping in so much oil it was gross
1121 2018-04-02 21:33:29 EPA Sec. Pruitt is officially rolling back car emission standards to make the air we breathe dirtier &
keep oil & gas industry happy. I’ll bet that rollback in violation of EPA standards & the EPA mandate enriches him personally, while at the same time putting our health at risk
1122 2018-04-02 21:33:25 Bad guy. Any woman that you follow i know issa fine sama!!

1130 2018-04-02 21:32:27 @JimLangevin Hi Congressman, please stop any  oil drilling on our coast if possible. Also let us know what we can do to stop any propaganda Sinclair tries to send up on Channel 10 in Providence.
1131 2018-04-02 21:32:14 Mmm, oil....  Happy Birthday!!! 
1132 2018-04-02 21:32:09 But it is not only plastic. Look around you. Almost everything you see (including food) was transported (possibly halfway around the world) in oil powered vehicles.
1133 2018-04-02 21:32:06 Why? Really Why? The auto makers will continue to increase mileage because they know TRUMP's rules are Temporary. The oil companies know the same thing so their not going to do anything different. This is Distraction, Confusion. This is TRUMP. Plus TRUMP's at War With CA.
1134 2018-04-02 21:31:47 I can smell rain in the air and the moon is red,
I will wait a little more for the storm, 
And will put oil on already burning flame, 
It will attract more moths,
If they do not die in storm why they are born then, right?
My good, my good...
1135 2018-04-02 21:31:38 ほんと、だいぶ暖かいなー
1136 2018-04-02 21:31:33 1. It was a confidence trick, with the snake oil not even defined.
2. However big problem is the snake oil doesn't work. There is no '#Breakit solution'
3. How cannot Corbyn and others see this? They are dying for a dead cause.
1137 2018-04-02 21:31:22 This is why we should invade and finish conquering Mexico, we will already have a southern boarder wall built-in. Win Win. Plus alot of oil
1138 2018-04-02 21:31:22 It’s all about trump and not solving the problem, ALl politicians take money from big oil, energy, auto!! So why restrict when you can eliminate? Should be the question
1139 2018-04-02 21:31:20 Hey @elonmusk @Tesla . Cruise / Cargo ships. Insane amount of oil use per year per ship. Battery powered? Automated? How feasible could that be?

1144 2018-04-02 21:30:31 I was at glasgow green on the first anti poll tax march, they still do what they want & were still poor, & the oil flowed then & still flows now 30 years on.

1149 2018-04-02 21:29:47 The fact is we do not need fossil fuels period, until every politician stops taking money from big oil, big auto and big energy it don’t matter what is passed, there is technology so we can abandon oil let’s  see @RepAdamSchiff @nytimes @latimes be the leaders in a real solution
1150 2018-04-02 21:29:41 Thanks for the tag @PIRATEDANTRAIN !!
1151 2018-04-02 21:29:41 Tesla is the more popular company that people want to fail because it'll help their ego to show they "were right". Also, oil is magical fairy fuel; never talk bad about it.
1152 2018-04-02 21:29:36 I doubt 1.2 cents a liter makes much difference after other taxes and greedy oil company profits!
1153 2018-04-02 21:29:20 The amount of bullshit in this statement is just another day ending in Y for @GovMaryFallin  and she'll probably wash the stink off having to write this by bathing in a tub of oil and spritzing with natural gas compliments of  the industries that bought her off.
1154 2018-04-02 21:29:17 It’s simple, less environmental regs equals higher emissions leading to more gasoline consumption. Yep, you guessed it, larger profits for “Big Oil”. And destroying our ecosystem at the same time.
1155 2018-04-02 21:29:16 Let me sit here with coconut oil in my hair as I binge watch Netflix and try not to cry out of frustration 
1156 2018-04-02 21:29:15 @SenJackReed Hi Senator, if it's true that Sinclair owns channel 10 in Pro. we need to stop their propaganda. We also need to stop Trump from oil drilling on our coast. What a disaster that could be.
1157 2018-04-02 21:29:13 Wanna talk about the cost of oil? Ask an olive!
1158 2018-04-02 21:29:00 In the context of the thread you responded to No NO no no! I said yes yes. To NDP who are for people than businesses Not Jason kenney who is strictly for big oil businesses! Are you following? Tweet and thread!!
1159 2018-04-02 21:28:53 Also, UK is a world leader in drilling. Aberdeen full of ex North Sea oil people highly qualified and many looking for a job. We have seriously dropped the ball on geothermal. Shallow<->mid depth for heating (huge CO2 reductions) and deep for energy generation. = baseload.
1160 2018-04-02 21:28:50 No baby... keep that forest organic for me  put some coconut oil for me

1165 2018-04-02 21:27:55 Right now I would gladly take the opportunity to punch a relative in the throat. Also my dogs cannabis oil arrived.

1167 2018-04-02 21:27:33 My gmom told me to use virgin olive oil since my baby was an infant and it cleared up her break outs and eczema. Try it for a few days and see if it helps u can get it at the market
1168 2018-04-02 21:27:24 Paid for by the oil lobbyists that seem to control California. Over 800 million in funding and where are we? Fuel prices and taxes so high people and businesses are leaving and taking great knowledge with them. The train to nowhere is no answer.
1169 2018-04-02 21:27:20 The auto industry and oil companies benefit-the consumer gets screwed.
1170 2018-04-02 21:27:05 Have you actually biked in suit? I want to try but I’m worried that the feet are too big and I’ll just get bike grime and oil on my suit!
1171 2018-04-02 21:26:42 Anyone know someone in large scale soyabean oil production? It's urgent!!
1172 2018-04-02 21:26:37 Tylenol doesn't help with swelling unfortunately. Get thee to thy chemist and get clove oil  - or call around and see if a dentist can see you at a discount rate. You don't want infection settling in. Just a concerned dad 
1173 2018-04-02 21:26:26 And there’s still the weirdness of thinking someone like Tom Steyer is really a Trojan horse for Big Oil.

How anyone could fall for this is stupefying. #bcpoli #ableg #cdnpoli
1174 2018-04-02 21:26:11 @SenWhitehouse Hi, is it true channel 10 in Providence is owned by Sinclair?  If so what can we do to stop them from putting their false news out there? Also we need to stop the CRAZY in the WH from allowing oil drilling on our RI coast.
1175 2018-04-02 21:26:09 Alex Jones is being sued again. That's what you get for selling snake oil theories ("conspiracy theories" implies that he believes what his divorce lawyer admitted is an act).
1176 2018-04-02 21:26:00 @elonmusk Some people want to see Tesla burn, my gut tells me oil companies are pushing this bs agenda. Greed truly will be our end. You keep fighting the good fight.

1188 2018-04-02 21:24:05 Big Oil should fund the switchover to clean renewables. Also they took natural resources from Earth for pennies, while profiting trillions $, which technically belongs to ALL Earthlings; so Big Oil should also fund Basic Income, Healthcare & Education to eradicate global poverty.
1189 2018-04-02 21:23:59 Palm Oil needs to be banned globally. It's in a lot of things and it's bad for you. It's also destroying the Rain Forest.

1198 2018-04-02 21:22:36 Dear Dr. Obasanjo, revamping FX reserve from $28 Billion to $48 Billion in less than 3 years at a record low oil price era does not sound like failure to me. Your desperation for political relevance will only lead you to a miserable end.

1203 2018-04-02 21:22:09 Yeah, we have the same argument daily over the words for and gor. Since I never write about "gas  oil relationships," I'm at a loss as to why  auto correct repeatedly changes "for" to "gor."
1204 2018-04-02 21:22:03 Well is it not the Canadian government that manipulated our dollar? I always thought the government manipulated our dollar so it was worth less so we could give our stuff away no? Or if we want a strong economy let the oil field fire up that’s the money maker in Canada

- have you caned the arse off it? 
- any more pics available?

Very interested if the answers are good!
1251 2018-04-02 21:15:46 Nfld already exports oil via the Atlantic Ocean. 

Ever asked why that oil doesn't go to eastern Canada instead of suggesting a horribly expensive 5000Km pipeline?

1254 2018-04-02 21:15:29 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1255 2018-04-02 21:15:25 1.  Ok try again... So after a brief exchange w an educator/ref/whatever, I went out to the oil patch, where I work. I saw men & women working in the rain, asking for extra hours, and trying their best to make a good living for their families. After reflection, I thought about
1256 2018-04-02 21:15:25 I wanna go rub down in coconut oil and lay out and tan my legs 
1257 2018-04-02 21:15:20 What was holiday oil thinking when they did that?!?
1258 2018-04-02 21:15:13 When you’re just trying to get your oil changed but all the workers keep screaming “yee yee” get me out of here 
1259 2018-04-02 21:14:55 Rolling back #CleanerCars standards forces us to spend more money on gas, increases our oil consumption and boosts pollution that endangers our health and drives climate change. #saveepacarlab
1260 2018-04-02 21:14:49 been away for a while and just catching up. Feel a lot more nervous about meal/beans than oil tho...
1261 2018-04-02 21:14:46 @isntthatbeatriz it’s Castro oil if you say it is
1262 2018-04-02 21:14:36 @LushLtd hi there, when will Oatifix be back in stock online? Its been off for a couple months? Quite a few others eg vanishing cream, imperialis, kerbside violet, bbseaweed, enchanted eye cream, marilyn hot oil out of stock too, all on wishlist, am trying to place order soon.Ta!
1263 2018-04-02 21:14:26 Will, see my response to Sin.
1264 2018-04-02 21:14:10 Yes, true!Religious ppl w/out HolySpirit,love&intimacy w the Lord. The Maccabees rededication of the defiled Holy Temple requiered a miracle of much extra oil 4 the lampstand. But IHVH Jaire, provided. Hope His grace is sufficiant 4 us, so our oil never runs out!
1265 2018-04-02 21:13:59 Perhaps I misread. I thought you were implying that Alexa Tsoulis-Reay was the woman in this story, when the intro says that it was "as told to." Sorry for any confusion; I will have my algorithm's oil changed and tires rotated.
1266 2018-04-02 21:13:56 Thanks Gary. Makes sense. Haven't crawled under yet. Still soaking up the oil spill. Maybe time to retire the old buggy. May have a protest her though - the favorite of the Mrs. - Drives beautifully.
1267 2018-04-02 21:13:49 Oil paint flat brush、PCのクリスタにも入れておこ～と思ったら削除されてしまってる。かなしい
1268 2018-04-02 21:13:40 As I said in the other tweet, you're the only one talking about arrests. Try to stay with the group.
1269 2018-04-02 21:13:36 I should get tanning oil since it takes me longer to get tanned
1270 2018-04-02 21:13:29 Get you some beard oil and find a loyal girl to eat her ass on the daily lmfao
1271 2018-04-02 21:13:22 To burn more Russian oil
1272 2018-04-02 21:13:16 Gun oil tears are the saltiest tears.
1273 2018-04-02 21:13:16 ((Also oil of oregano. Tastes gross but works Everytime))
1274 2018-04-02 21:13:09 @GOP Your brand is now the anti-environment party. Why? This literally helps NOBODY except oil companies.

1276 2018-04-02 21:13:08 Kelly, how did I ignore due process? You're the only one talking about arrests. The rest of us are discussing convictions where due process is covered.
1277 2018-04-02 21:13:03 Got out of class early so I came to get a much needed oil change. They playing Despicable Me in the waiting room. I’m lit.
1278 2018-04-02 21:12:49 Back to the 50’s Putin’s only Money maker is Oil Rosnef will be fed by Trump and Pruitt’s Conspiracy This is well planned
1279 2018-04-02 21:12:43 dumb oil heater makes you tore up
1280 2018-04-02 21:12:39 If I understand tRumpy’s business message properly, he’s saying American workers must no longer be slaves to high tech. They must be slaves to oil and gas.
1281 2018-04-02 21:12:33 And after oil money?
1282 2018-04-02 21:12:10 That is the new oil.
1283 2018-04-02 21:12:10 Coconut oil for everything
1284 2018-04-02 21:12:07 di naman ata oil pastel gamit nung hayup na yun e
1285 2018-04-02 21:12:06 WRONG!! AMAZON is the new STANDARD OIL  or MA BELL--NEEDS to be broken up!!
1286 2018-04-02 21:12:06 For almost 100 years, we put oil in cars by using a messy spout and funnel before some genius invented the plastic bottle with its own spout. Then, some genius invented the upside-down squeeze bottle for condiments. Now, we await the genius who puts a Zip-lock on a bag of chips.
1287 2018-04-02 21:11:57 Kelly, see my response to Sin.

1289 2018-04-02 21:11:41 My dad just spent $31 on olive oil...
1290 2018-04-02 21:11:36 Getting my oil changed. It's been 40 mins in a mall. I've read the entire internet. Send help
1291 2018-04-02 21:11:34 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump US controls Syria's oil reserves. Not only would pulling an Obama lead to a power vacuum in Syria only to be filled by Iran, it would also hand Iran Syria's oil on a silver platter which would then be used to fund further Iranian terrorism
1292 2018-04-02 21:11:32 The Liberals do not like Alberta. They are will to shut it down to help the Russian,  Saudi Arabia and Venezuela oil industries. No carbon tax on Saudi oil going into Quebec.

1294 2018-04-02 21:11:03 15cm diameter and about 13cm deep. Oil and bake for an hour before using. Line with plenty of baking paper... As I learnt the hard way first time!
1295 2018-04-02 21:11:01 Sin, one problem with that law is it doesn't apply to all convicted DV. Also "relinquish" law needed and "interstate commerce" limits application; results in posession not illegal. This fed laws fails to acheive goal of no guns for convicted DV perps.
1296 2018-04-02 21:10:54 I’m using this oil repair n it helps with the process of regrowth it’s helps a lot
1297 2018-04-02 21:10:53 Just found out I’ve been over paying for oil changes basically since I could drive  #dontbelievethe10minutesign

1299 2018-04-02 21:10:47 We need to gel as a team for when things get hectic.

But if gel's no good for you, we can use lotion or oil too.
1300 2018-04-02 21:10:35 Castor oil!!!
1301 2018-04-02 21:10:25 @Jenna_Marbles @juliensolomita Snake Oil is always the best stuff on the webs. Thanks for the laughs.

1304 2018-04-02 21:10:20 Some are oil free, use those techniques in other recipes. Most use a 1/2 to 1 tsp to saute, which can easily be omitted. saute in water or broth. Baked recipes use oil spray, which also can be omitted. Just keep an eye on the bake time, so the food doesnt dry out too much.
1305 2018-04-02 21:10:20 D'aww!!!! Dat face!!!!
1306 2018-04-02 21:10:15 Who wants to own this jem? 2006 Jeep Commander. 220,000 miles. Great vehicle. $3,900 Every couple thousand miles it needs some oil added.
1307 2018-04-02 21:10:13 I’ve lived in MidEast for 7 years. What this guy is doing might be small steps to us, but huge strides for his people. Older shaibani clerics disagree, but women-only universities, driving and without chaperones is a BIG deal. His reliance on oil is ending. Needs to woo the West
1308 2018-04-02 21:10:10 more likely something to do with raising funds via energy deals. Russia cut oil deals with Italy.
1309 2018-04-02 21:10:10 i should’ve brought a snack to get my oil changed 
1310 2018-04-02 21:10:08 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1311 2018-04-02 21:10:02 My legs are about to cook I have vitamin E oil on lmao
1312 2018-04-02 21:09:56 Agree

Also how could they Possibly Object to CBD OIL ?
It does NoT have THC
Thus No "Head High"

1313 2018-04-02 21:09:54 I just got my first oil change since i got the car last August 
1314 2018-04-02 21:09:52 It's not coconut oil?
1315 2018-04-02 21:09:46 What type of oil? Sunflower? Olive? Coconut? Toasted sesame? The people want to know...
1316 2018-04-02 21:09:34 In a pan with oil... how my family has always done it.. gets the edges crispy and sooo good
1317 2018-04-02 21:09:29 Thanks, I have too much and and it’s too thick haha but I used 30vol for 35 minutes so it’s not too fried, and it’s been marinating in coconut oil for hours now
1318 2018-04-02 21:09:13 Real story: Trump goon and oil shill to destroy an intelligent and reasoned approach to fixing an existential threat to our Country to line the pockets of the psychotically greedy pigs behind the Right Wing machine who’s propaganda arm is reporting this story.
1319 2018-04-02 21:09:01 Go for the lowest calorie-dense foods: vegetables & fruits. You can eat a lot of food and still lose body fat. Vegetables are #1. Avoid animal products completely. Severely limit or eliminate oil and other processed foods.
1320 2018-04-02 21:08:43 So what you really need to do is, get dish soap/antibacterial soap & put a cap full of olive oil/vegetable oil in a plastic Tupperware & mix your beauty blender in there & rub all that nastyness off & run it under cool water. Repeat till looking brand new 
1321 2018-04-02 21:08:31 "... I don't even thing we have oil... meant for machines that is..." A sweat drop moment from Rachnera as she simply didn't have any response to that... there was synthetic oil though from the auto-parts directory but... was it enough for >
1322 2018-04-02 21:08:21 Oil and T. Mo don’t mix.
1323 2018-04-02 21:08:15 We really have people come in here going 20 thousand miles since their last oil change... How is your car still moving bruh
1324 2018-04-02 21:08:14 Form + consist angle of release > speed > personal bowl > oil thickness of lane
1325 2018-04-02 21:08:13 coconut oil, castor oil and almond oil are the only things I need in my life rn I swear
1326 2018-04-02 21:07:58 As the rest of the world reigns in carbon pollution, this country will soon see people wearing gas masks just like we saw in China before they curtailed the pollution.  All because Koch and other big oil  bought the @GOP. #EndCitizensUnited
1327 2018-04-02 21:07:52 so while I was at work my grandpa filled my car up with gas, changed the oil in my car, and washed it. y'all 
1328 2018-04-02 21:07:35 Nice, you still get to choose the topics you discuss with others. Alexa won't let me talk about that brand any more. She'll cut me off if I even mention Halo T
1329 2018-04-02 21:07:15 Americans ruined Cadbury's with palm oil in the chocolate
1330 2018-04-02 21:07:01 Motor Oil chases down the Tide Pods SO well though!
1331 2018-04-02 21:06:51 I also don’t have much of a diet. I generally stay away from fatty foods & my sugar intake has also gone down. Even at restaurants, I change my chips for hot veg, the less oil the better.
1332 2018-04-02 21:06:46 Than no she can’t have a refund it’s a part of a routine not a miracle oil tbh not oil takes 2-3 months and should be used after washing and toning and than add a moisturizer to get good results
1333 2018-04-02 21:06:38 With massive natural resources available in Nigeria, it is unfortunate that we aren't exporting ANY to complement oil revenue!

We are like a fish in the ocean that keeps screaming "I am thirsty"!

What a nation!

1334 2018-04-02 21:06:35 Is there any #oil in there?
1335 2018-04-02 21:06:18 For my sister! Merry Christmas! She sent me these photos and I did small oil paintings. (I have’t painted in years and am in thrilled to be back in the flow!
1336 2018-04-02 21:06:14 Nabasa ng oil or ulan?

To 'em you're yet another oil well
1339 2018-04-02 21:05:59 For those of you that take fish oil every morning... God Bless ya cause that stuff is nasty.
1340 2018-04-02 21:05:37 You approach the armchair, and notice a mysterious man looming by it who has placed a large hand on it. He appears to be guarding it, as his companion searches for a trolley. There is a dirty oil stain on the leg. You read the price tag - £35 from £129.
1341 2018-04-02 21:05:24 My car takes 12-14q of oil  expensive oil change 
1342 2018-04-02 21:05:20 The reason is to sell more gasoline for gas guzzling vehicles to enrich Trump and his oil tycoon friends....plain and simple.
1343 2018-04-02 21:05:12 The swamp is full of oil.
1344 2018-04-02 21:05:09 Didn’t realize how much more expensive synthetic oil changes are
1345 2018-04-02 21:05:08 Anthony just FaceTimed me & he’s COVERED in oil
1346 2018-04-02 21:05:05 Plastic is made from a toxic, non-renewable resource. The pollution resulting from oil extraction, plastic manufacture and transport is devastating. Half of the plastic made each year is for disposable products, stuff we use for moments. It's an extraordinary and avoidable waste.
1347 2018-04-02 21:05:01 Surely there is a market for beautiful oil paintings of all my favorite dumb Pokemon.
1348 2018-04-02 21:05:00 I'd forgotten how much of a drama my last heating oil delivery was! My Sainsbury's delivery driver just asked if it had arrived yet! #nodramas
1349 2018-04-02 21:04:42 OK. Managed 3 minutes. Elements of Monty Don coming out of foliage in a Japanese garden at Hampton Court, elements of aforementioned escalator needing oil #14mins
1350 2018-04-02 21:04:41 The BEST 7 HEMP CBD OIL ON THE MARKET!  1OZ / 30ML  { WATER SOLUBLE!! } IS THE KEY! ABSORBS so QWIK!!! 0.25-1 ml daily helps all your pain/anxiety for ever!! This has been the best thing for me!!! Most bottles this size last a month or more!! Cinnamon or Berry
1351 2018-04-02 21:04:23 This whole 10 minute oil change business is in fact not only 10 minutes 
1352 2018-04-02 21:04:18 coconut oil all on this melanin brightens up the galaxy in my skin.
1353 2018-04-02 21:04:11 Smoking expansion rode that wave up too - but sugar 'n' veg oil drove it home as the cigs faded... 
1354 2018-04-02 21:04:10 How else will Big Russian Oil make more money?
1355 2018-04-02 21:03:52 I think we will give away a FREE OIL CHANGE this week. Keep an eye out, the person who is on their toes will be the winner!
1356 2018-04-02 21:03:28 And I’m Finna Get Sum More Oil
1357 2018-04-02 21:03:13 Just for starters with his new fashion oil. Contract is OK, it like trading gold but with cny, isn't?
1358 2018-04-02 21:03:06 I doubt MFAT was privy to the oil protest that far in advance. But if @audreyNZH has been told by a political source that MFAT proposed a PC and that is not true, then this is pretty serious.
1359 2018-04-02 21:03:01 They are on the perimeter of the building that #HowardStudentStrong seized, and patrol throughout the campus. Student safety is assured.  Additionally, backup units from @DCPoliceDept are available on a moments notice. #HUresist

1365 2018-04-02 21:02:08 As a club, we are in the best state in living memory but Russian and Saudi oil money still stand in the way it’s near impossible to compete with. A lot of our fans are just very angry and probably rather jealous as city and Chelsea were basically the same club as us.
1366 2018-04-02 21:02:06 Except that it will hurt #oil, something you will find our president is invested in via “offshore development.”
1367 2018-04-02 21:02:06 OIL DIFF: 5.09 -> 5.12
1368 2018-04-02 21:02:04 Pl don't consider only crude oil prices? Lots of problem in whole india last many many years. Contract system, less salary, all prices r hikes, 24 hours all leaders tweet on social site but no probkems solve middle n poor class pples. We r not happy frm Congress n bjp Govt.
1369 2018-04-02 21:01:49 Olive Oil - FREE SHIPPING - This Week Only!
1370 2018-04-02 21:01:46 This is ridiculous.  Focusing on coal and oil when we need to increase solar use and cleaner energy
1371 2018-04-02 21:01:43 Gas goes up about 25 cents a gallon in past week+ which PO’s the heck out of me but worse is Okla Gas & Oil Industry playing a fiddle while screwing public overall with their product pricing & their own teachers in refusing to pay them! Where does the money go? #Strike #RedForEd
1372 2018-04-02 21:01:29 If @JeffBezos buys an oil refinery maybe we’ll get some common sense environmental regulations from this @WhiteHouse...
1373 2018-04-02 21:01:26 A single quart (946 mL) of motor oil dumped on the ground or in the trash, can contaminate up to 2 million gallons (7.6 million litres) of fresh water #environment
1374 2018-04-02 21:01:22 Well let’s see if this stops my oil leak 
1375 2018-04-02 21:01:17 I guess all those products that are made from oil weren't such a bad thing after all!
1376 2018-04-02 21:01:04 Kima I finally bought a dry brush and almond oil and it feels so great and my skin is so soft and THANK YOU.
1377 2018-04-02 21:00:51 He's ever scored 3 past your oil moneycity
1378 2018-04-02 21:00:16 Tell Mexico we're going to stop buying their oil if they don't stop these illegals from entering our country
1379 2018-04-02 21:00:16 April 02, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1380 2018-04-02 21:00:02 Bad idea for us peons, but good for giant auto mfgs., big oil, and billionaires. Leave it alone and let auto mfgs. innovate a solution.
1381 2018-04-02 21:00:00 Let's be honest... Dems and security are like oil and water. Time after time, from Clinton (both of them), to Wasserman-Schultz, to illegal immigration, there is a blatant disregard for the security of our Country. You could easily come up with 1,000 examples. 
1382 2018-04-02 20:59:58 Lol. Couldn’t because those cars all run on oil could it? 
1383 2018-04-02 20:59:54 I love you so much  well rub that oil on your muscles tonight baby I’m sorry you hurt. I love you
1384 2018-04-02 20:59:50 Life changing. Also, just be more aware of what you’re putting on your skin. Some products will dry you out so hard. I use Burt’s Bees Apricot Face Scrub, tone with Thayer’s, moisturize with a rosehip oil in morning and a lavender night cream.
1385 2018-04-02 20:59:48 That’s real bro I ain’t took one off since January smh but im probably bout to go get an oil change and go 2 da west see where @SneakBFinessin at
1386 2018-04-02 20:59:43 Because the state of Israel is the oil/resource hungry US and globalist´s foot in the door, to the middle east. OIL! The US funded the massive air base in Israel. It is rather, the 51st state.
1387 2018-04-02 20:59:26 i want to try it so bad !!!!! it’s just pricy for the nice oil (i’ve only ever looked at health food stores) so i’ve never gotten it cuz i have thc lol  what kind of vape pen do u have because i kinda want one but i know nothing about them

1392 2018-04-02 20:59:10 coming to the Australian Bite if #LNP , Big Oil Mates get their way
1393 2018-04-02 20:59:07 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.
1394 2018-04-02 20:58:49 I just made my own lavender linen spray. Because I'm not gonna let big-apothecary charge me $25 for oil and witch hazel. #YogaMomResistence
1395 2018-04-02 20:58:43 Those last 2 episodes were intense guys! I cannot imagine what the final episode will bring! Lavender oil might be needed for the final!

Oil and text and cork
1397 2018-04-02 20:58:06 "could accept" seems like pointing at the NZ govt. Maybe they didn't want to host a PC and have it sidetracked by Q's about meeting with oil protesters etc, which was always going to happen when you delay the meeting for it
1398 2018-04-02 20:58:01 good news for major oil exporter Putin
1399 2018-04-02 20:57:21 But the finest quality Madagascan peanut butter with delicate hint of truffle oil from Waitrose
1400 2018-04-02 20:57:04 @DawnDish soap was hailed as a wildlife rescue hero for cleaning hundreds of birds after the Gulf Coast oil spill in 2010. Consumers viewed the brand with pride for being part of the overall humanitarian response to this ecological disaster
1401 2018-04-02 20:56:57 A bug flew onto my face while I was getting my oil changed, and I have never caused a bigger scene. Gonna have to find a new place to get my oil changed from now on.
1402 2018-04-02 20:56:49 Is that why he fired Tillerson to go back into the oil business?
1403 2018-04-02 20:56:47 I have been waiting to see how the higher yield CEF's hold up with what is happening in bond and stock land.  When oil was crushed, there were some attractive opportunities in high-yield and related area as long as you were willing to wade through the holdings and pick/choose.
1404 2018-04-02 20:56:32 Start funding schools. Oklahoma must tax oil & gas industry that destroying its land and water.
1405 2018-04-02 20:56:30 I saw the same report.  @AliVelshi should have also have delved into WHY OK's GOP run state legislature has passed huge budget cuts to education (due to corporate tax breaks to oil industry)  We already know these teachers work hard & are underpaid.
1406 2018-04-02 20:56:16 Bro i hate taking my oil somewhere to get it changed these niggas take forever
1407 2018-04-02 20:56:12 Olive oil, garlic powder, S&P and roast 'em at 400.
1408 2018-04-02 20:56:10 I don't use a body scrub. I just make my own diy lip scrubs. Olive oil and sugar.
1409 2018-04-02 20:56:10 I think I like the oil most 
1410 2018-04-02 20:55:55 @askMollyReardon
told me long time ago )after I wrecked my Easter Ham by cooking it with a layer of plastic still on it) “Shaina you aren’t here to bake bread” 
Totally true. Most recently I decided to pan fry chicken. it was awful. I submerged it in the oil..Trying again now
1411 2018-04-02 20:55:49 I worked for an oil company for 33 1/2 years and sometimes I wanted to quit and sometimes it was because I thought the company was wrong. I was stuck financially so I stayed through those times and I'm not proud of that. "Life happens while we make other plans"--John Lennon
1412 2018-04-02 20:55:41 I LOVE LOVE my Essential Oil Starter Kit. I use everyone of them for one reason or another. Peace and Calming at night for my son! Joy for me in the morning. Lemon for an itchy throat. Lavender for cuts or dry skin!~!!! $20 rebate for YOU to get started ! PM me
1413 2018-04-02 20:55:38 @AdariusBowman @KuntryKane205 Vegas is in town to play @EdmontonOilers on Thursday. Come cheer on the Oil one last time, what dya say?
1414 2018-04-02 20:55:26 Rolling back fuel economy benefits only the oil companies. The technological advances and manufacturing required to improve fuel efficiency creates new jobs and promotes American leadership, not to mention the benefits at the gas pump, cleaner air, and our climate future
1415 2018-04-02 20:55:23 Auto pieces, oil leaking, dripping gasoline
Door is open, windows broken, glass shattered dreams
Holy bibles, open beer bottles at the scene
1416 2018-04-02 20:55:22 no :( the only one ive done is the one she said to mix coconut and castor oil in my hair. I think i’m gonna go darker in the full, I want to get my time/money’s worth of being blonde lol
1417 2018-04-02 20:55:22 @jakequery I think the biggest issue with soccer at Lucas Oil Stadium is turf vs. actual grass. I was reading wear some players refuse to play on artificial surfaces.
1418 2018-04-02 20:55:12 propaganda?  -  #tofu #oil  would seem more of an exporter situation
1419 2018-04-02 20:55:10 The coconut oil was solid like ice that was a decapitated head in the last scene of star trek ffs.
1420 2018-04-02 20:54:53 The car people always wanna tell you 10 things is wrong with your whip when you come for an oil change .  Lol I'm appreciative but look sir , One check at a time. Jeez
1421 2018-04-02 20:54:51 This fucking art dealer on #TheIsland is horrendous. Making fat remarks when he's no oil painting. #cunt
1422 2018-04-02 20:54:37 Is the canola oil really safe?? Otherwise, send me a lifetime supply! Cost is no issue!
1423 2018-04-02 20:54:13 He suported them since 2008  thats when the oil money started lol he plastic fan and dont like fact
1424 2018-04-02 20:54:11 Coconut oil fixes everything but my bank account
1425 2018-04-02 20:54:10 i swear they had released the oil slick hat ages ago i remember seeing it on the site
1426 2018-04-02 20:54:04 Measure three pounds of olive oil and lower the temperature.
1427 2018-04-02 20:53:55 If the wall runs at $50 billiom, how much for the whole country? Why doesn't Trump just take the seized assets and buy it ? I'd figure it for a Trillion, Lotta oil and good agriculture, they have to throw in the Mayan ruins though.
1428 2018-04-02 20:53:44 NOoooooooooo. I love the NBA arenas.  Such better basketball venues. Sitting in Lucas Oil is not a good way to watch a game.
1429 2018-04-02 20:53:36 My Monday:

Go to work 

Made a bowl of cereal just to spill it all into my lap

Found out somehow my dipstick tube decided to come loose? Or somethin but my truck leaks oil until I figure it out 

Nash got into a porcupine and I had to pick 30 quills out 

Now it’s back to work
1430 2018-04-02 20:53:34 thanks man. No planer, (i think my wife would kill me if i got more wood working tools) just sanded it down. filled the cracks with epoxy and the stone, danish oil then the general finishes.
1431 2018-04-02 20:53:25 Actually yes they can. #statesrights And don’t be surprised when other states follow CAs lead to help protect our environment. Someone has to bc we know you won’t. We all know your pockets are lined by oil and mining company lobbyists. #corruptionhill #polluter #RESIGN
1432 2018-04-02 20:53:18 I saw a really awful painting in Cecil court the other day. It was this brown muddy-looking Hill. Dark olive green. The oil paint was applied with a pallet knife that made it look like a frosted cake. I think the price reflected the cost of the paint 
1433 2018-04-02 20:53:17 @BOCMadaki  na one dope ass brutha on the beat.
1434 2018-04-02 20:53:11 Desirable ASAP but assess Brexit developments and be flexible if required. Date between  Oct18 - Mar19, depending on Brexit outcomes. That covers majority in poll so far. Need EU single mkt & custom union agreed, strategy / Plan on: Border, currency/fish&agri/oil/defence &EU asap
1435 2018-04-02 20:53:10 Stuck on stupid ignorant amateur climate experts.
Too hot
Too cold
Just right, except 10,000 years ago the northern US was under a mile of ice.
No oil, no gas, no nothing.
What caused it ?
1436 2018-04-02 20:52:50 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @HighwayRock365
1437 2018-04-02 20:52:48 @natboltt has me looking at ingrediance lists on candy...  I realize now how much of it has palm oil and I found anything I had bought previously that has palm oil seems to be really oily feeling,  I think I may start paying more attention to the ingredients in my food now.
1438 2018-04-02 20:52:46 I can’t change a tire or even my oil for that matter, but I can damn sure make my car stay as perfect as the day I got it. That is all. 
1439 2018-04-02 20:52:17 If she transfered, she would have been because I wanted to know more about oil than let her wrap round and round?
1440 2018-04-02 20:52:10 beach, tanning oil, and ice cream. a perfect spring break 
1441 2018-04-02 20:52:03 I know the meanings of the individual words.  What the hell are you trying to say about Tea Tree oil?
1442 2018-04-02 20:51:55 this news of an oil transaction on the blockchain has nothing to do with $sx... in fact $btl has been beta testing its Interbit blockchain tech with a few multi billion oil companies.. sx hasn't done anything but yammer on about how great its tech is...
1443 2018-04-02 20:51:41 Need more coconut oil soon.
1444 2018-04-02 20:51:39 This was true prior to LED shoeboxes.  The DDR used low pressure sodium lamps, and West-Berlin metal halide.  Until you tear out fixture wiring, you can't change it.
The UK and much of the US also used low pressure sodium. Cops hate it, because motor oil looks just like blood
1445 2018-04-02 20:51:39 2008 ye thats when the oil money started point proven
1446 2018-04-02 20:51:37 oil had a rough day
1447 2018-04-02 20:51:23 I just get mine on amazon. Came in capsules. Found they didn’t do much but if I bit into them and let oil desolve and sit in mouth for a min they worked great!
1448 2018-04-02 20:51:21 Bank Holiday Weekend did not go to plan. I spent most of it sick, but I did get to spend some quality time with @JamesRenhard which we don’t prioritise enough. Sorry if I’ve spent most of it moaning and smelling like Olbas oil. You are a good nurse and all round good human. 
1449 2018-04-02 20:50:42 sexy tasty oil rig.
1450 2018-04-02 20:50:24 I also believe we get a bounce......before the inevitable fall into the depths of hell......and of course.....oil will find it's way to being destroyed. As the wise elephant stated, you just have to wait :)
1451 2018-04-02 20:50:13 Switch to olive oil =P
1452 2018-04-02 20:49:56 Also helpful to countries that rely heavily on oil for their economy. Like, say, Russia.
1453 2018-04-02 20:49:50 If you had the choice of Cardiff getting promoted or giving Donald Trump a massage...would you use baby or coconut oil?
1454 2018-04-02 20:49:43 The Donald obviously doesn’t care what kind of future he leaves for our children.  He prefers to dump the Clean Air standards, sell our public lands and open the CA coast and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Who do you suppose benefits from these changes?$?
1455 2018-04-02 20:49:23 My car just fucking died getting an oil change!!!! Hahahahahahahahahaha im embarrassed
1456 2018-04-02 20:49:23 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
1457 2018-04-02 20:49:14 This terrorist group has been created by France for oil interest in Nigeria ! A unstable Nigeria is better for oil business ! Wake up guys !
1458 2018-04-02 20:49:13 Omg what would u market it as would it b like a skin care product or a cooking oil or..?? Imagine beauty gurus reviewing ur slick
1459 2018-04-02 20:48:59 This weather tryna set me up knowing damn well I had oil to change
1460 2018-04-02 20:48:55 When you are a fraud and snake oil salesman used to blathering shareholder adoration, I guess you do!
1461 2018-04-02 20:48:46 People seem to be thinking it’s like the Lucas oil as it’s in keeping with area . Though as you say we won’t know until more images get released. Let’s hope it’s over 60k as well
1462 2018-04-02 20:48:41 i really want to know what happened here but i feel like its just going to be something stupid like someone blew up a oil barrel of lube
1463 2018-04-02 20:48:37 Smokin’ Gas, got my Tank on 93 supreme... Smokin’ Gas, Drinkin’ Oil no Kerosene  #WhenVulturesCry
1464 2018-04-02 20:48:27 here’s the plan, I don’t wash it for at least three days, THEN I shampoo lightly and condition deeply, then put a hair mask on/coconut oil depending, and then after a week I bleach it again (all the while wearing hats to hide the ginger)
1465 2018-04-02 20:48:22 Also @CadburyUK what are you doing about palm oil in your products, are you looking for alternatives?
1466 2018-04-02 20:48:12 Notice also the tax breaks they've been giving the oil industry during that time...
1467 2018-04-02 20:48:05 Sounds like the bypass line. Prepare the fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads.
1468 2018-04-02 20:47:57 Follow the petrochemicals. You’ll find all roads lead from Trump to our American oil overlords.
1469 2018-04-02 20:47:47 ugh yes!! that’s the worst, there’s always the few of us that has to deal with that shit bad like, none of my friends get their periods bad like that and i’m just like you’re so lucky! you should also use peppermint oil on your abdomen to relieve some cramps i used to do that 
1470 2018-04-02 20:47:41 Olive Oil - FREE SHIPPING - This week only!
1471 2018-04-02 20:47:39 Better oil dey this guy @MisturBets head. May your head never lack oil 
1472 2018-04-02 20:47:31 Yeah I’m suing it pure. I have heard if you have sensitive skin that you should use it with a carrier oil. But I never had that issue.
1473 2018-04-02 20:47:30 Somebody get me some oil pastels
1474 2018-04-02 20:47:30 Yeah they on Facebook putting baby oil and water on they pussy lol... mfs so lucky I’m blocked rn 
1475 2018-04-02 20:47:25 Is that regular mineral oil you are putting on the boards? Nice background music also
1476 2018-04-02 20:47:11 Yummy yum yum, can't wait to join you in the shower and all that hot oil off your gorgeous body
1477 2018-04-02 20:46:56 Preach motherfucker preach
1478 2018-04-02 20:46:55 Of course it has to be cold pressed, I put the addition of it having to be pressed by female feet. Maybe why my olive oil bill is sky high
1479 2018-04-02 20:46:55 i don’t get why they don’t just start refining different types of oil into car juice. like yeah we’ll run out of fossils but are we really gonna run out of olives??
1480 2018-04-02 20:46:48 I hate changing my oil. Fully capable, got all the shit, know how to do forwards and backwards...but, I'd gladly pay someone else to do it. 
1481 2018-04-02 20:46:46 Y’all putting baby oil and water on y’all  now?
1482 2018-04-02 20:46:43 Thanks lovely - that bath oil sounds gorgeous!
1483 2018-04-02 20:46:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
1484 2018-04-02 20:46:37 Monash group calls for govt to build coal plants cos community & private sector has moved on to newer tech. Why drop there? How about whale oil street lights? @RNBreakfast
1485 2018-04-02 20:46:34 “I’ve been shot. I’m bleeding too much and I’m currently dying. Someone please call 911”

Twitter: Drink water, exfoliate and use vitamin e oil
1486 2018-04-02 20:46:27 I think I'll rub palm oil this night it's a remedy for so many things, why not
1487 2018-04-02 20:46:06 @JudgeJeanine  Why can't the President ask Brazil and Mexico for the 2 Billion Loans given to them by Obama for "oil drilling".   We need that money to build the WALL.
1488 2018-04-02 20:45:58 The only company her comment applies to is Imperial Oil (majority owner Exxon). Most of the rest are Canadian-owned as well...that is jut a red herring
1489 2018-04-02 20:45:49 Strat with Iraqi Kurdistan almost one Billion $$$ per day, cut the oil supply
1490 2018-04-02 20:45:43 Yes, you are correct. Line 3 serves Minnesota which, as the map clearly shows, does not have a saltwater port. 

Line 3 will not export to overseas markets but will allow oil to be exported to a market where there is demand for it.
1491 2018-04-02 20:45:40 NO I HAVE A WAY BETTER TIP: coconut oil right after a shower. @theames came up with this & is a genius.
1492 2018-04-02 20:45:38 My Moroccan oil came in and yo girl happy af 
1493 2018-04-02 20:45:28 Exactly! Just added lemon and olive oil, salt n pepper. It’s quite full on mind!
1494 2018-04-02 20:45:27 Oil change & full interior detail on the girlfriends car. Hope she love me, my services ain’t cheap 
1495 2018-04-02 20:45:26 The place I get my oil changed has Rich the Kid playing so you know they do quality work 
1496 2018-04-02 20:45:18 Gotta make the oil companies richer. EPA, what EPA? These people are trading pollution for more money.
1497 2018-04-02 20:45:12 Say this very fast in a row like 10 times. and break your tongue ... "Oil Drilling".
1498 2018-04-02 20:45:09 Hella snitching . Getting my oil change for the free
1499 2018-04-02 20:44:58 okay ive been seeing this a lot and i wanted to add my opinion on it. DONT do the whole "no pumping gas on April 15th" thing. you will need to get gas either the day before or after which will actually benefit oil companies due to an influx of revenue on those days
1500 2018-04-02 20:44:42 Watching The Good Life and Richard Briers is just trying to siphon the oil when Felicity Kendal says, "Suck harder!" 
They don't make 'em like that any more.
1501 2018-04-02 20:44:41 @hismaryJAYNE Oof! Have you taken care of the oil change?
1502 2018-04-02 20:44:34 They said olive oil and dish soap and I did :(
1503 2018-04-02 20:44:34 States will do anything for the oil industry, EXCEPT provide local school districts with the $ needed to educate the kids of oil industry employees. No immediate profit in educating workers' families, so let's give more tax breaks to the corporations and the already rich. Fools!
1504 2018-04-02 20:44:18 last free oil change today 
1505 2018-04-02 20:44:16 Oil, deep water harbour close to Antarctic for exploitation.
1506 2018-04-02 20:44:14 Afghanistan has no oil.
1507 2018-04-02 20:43:53 He's silent because he shares the same goals as Israel. He wants to join the club that is warring for Syria's oil pipeline. The same one that Murdoch and Cheney have interests in.
Murdoch has the Tories by the short & curlies. It's called blackmail imho.
1508 2018-04-02 20:43:51 Thank you!! Teatree oil, I have that.
1509 2018-04-02 20:43:49 no wow! follow the money, this is all a play. SA, Israel and US are making deals behind the scenes to counter Iran. This is more about oil $ than anything. Israel is making a very dangerous play though; making deals with the devil are usually short sighted and tend to bite back.
1510 2018-04-02 20:43:48 The normal ones have orange oil in. Is my favourite thing about smarties. But the mini ones don’t. Lame
1511 2018-04-02 20:43:37 Huh. We got subsidies when we went from oil to mini split 5 years ago (in Seattle), but maybe that program ended.
1512 2018-04-02 20:43:34 Cbd oil you do me wonders
1513 2018-04-02 20:43:32 Coconut oil or Kuza
1514 2018-04-02 20:43:31 All I got out of the replies are block knj and peppermint oil. What did you end up doing?
1515 2018-04-02 20:43:30 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

1518 2018-04-02 20:43:22 I put wild growth oil in my shampoo and conditioner idk why I just be experimenting when it come to my natural hair but bitchhh for some reason I feel like my hair growing so fast right now.
1519 2018-04-02 20:43:19 Wasn’t ethanol the original fuel of cars until the oil industry bullied the migration to fossil fuel
1520 2018-04-02 20:42:58 yeah definitely! your skin is just trying to maintain it’s pH level &if you wash your face without moisturizing it makes more oil to try and fix itself. skin has what’s called an “acid mantle” that protects us from a lot of bacteria and such and it’s important to take care of it.
1521 2018-04-02 20:42:57 The bigset feeder to #Turkish Economy is Iraqi #Kurdistan more that one billion $$ per month plus Turkey get oil with 1/5 the world price. so first start With Kurdistan cut the oil supply.
1522 2018-04-02 20:42:52 @EPAScottPruitt must go. He must go soon. Scott Pruitt is the most dangerous Cabinet member out there...and he's a crook. Look at his disgraceful record of wasteful spending and environmental negligence. In bed with oil pimps. He must go. Spread the word! @RWPUSA @SteveSchmidtSES
1523 2018-04-02 20:42:49 2/ Using your breathtakingly tortured logic, oil & plastic are just as “natural” an archaeo-“biofuel” but no oil apologist is so duplicitous as to claim that all its derivative petrochemical distillates, polymers, and waste byproducts are “natural” “safe” or “organic.”
1524 2018-04-02 20:42:38 oil cleansing + dr bronner soap is all your face needs in this life!!!
1525 2018-04-02 20:42:33 I didnt even know the difference between oil for your car until after I bought it and made my appt at Midas. I know for next time 
1526 2018-04-02 20:42:25 I don’t think the olive oil is specific it said just for comfort 
1527 2018-04-02 20:42:24 POR EL AMOR DE CRISTO! OIL! QUE HACES?!
1528 2018-04-02 20:42:12 Fred says, "I am quite happy that my knee and hip pain has reduced almost to zero, taking 6 drops of the 500mg oil twice a day!"
1529 2018-04-02 20:42:05 Reasons my oil light is constantly on 
1530 2018-04-02 20:41:55 But, if not purchased already seasoned... the coating is layers of oil baked on over time. 
All of my pots were inherited and require reseasoning after every use
1531 2018-04-02 20:41:55 USING CANOLA OIL IN YOUR HOT BAR IS NOT ALIGNED WITH YOUR VALUES 
1532 2018-04-02 20:41:30 went for a simple oil change and this nigga gonna try to tell me that my car got all these problems. nigga I know, just change my damn oil.
1533 2018-04-02 20:41:28 use tanning oil every 2 hrs :)
1534 2018-04-02 20:41:28 You can also add about 10-20 drops of tea tree oil to your shampoo or conditioner(if you’re doing a cowash) another option is to dilute the tea tree oil with coconut oil and massage your scalp with that..it shld stop the itching in a week or two
1535 2018-04-02 20:41:11 So I’m getting my oil changed right now and I’m in the waiting room and this dad and son came in... little did I know that they both have about 15 different personalities and accents to match with them.
1536 2018-04-02 20:41:04 I love how everybody admits we got the oil in syrian
1537 2018-04-02 20:41:01 5-10mins then apply the coconut oil before going to bed 
1538 2018-04-02 20:40:52 Essential oil peeps — what are you go-to brands? I’m trying to find one that’s relatively affordable but still good quality.
1539 2018-04-02 20:40:43 This article Is about what happened but not the reasons to secure that territory. The reason was to secure the southest piece of land for the then empire that gives the right to own the south pole in that particular meridian and the huge reserves of oil discovered there.
1540 2018-04-02 20:40:36 It’s always so satisfying getting your oil changed lol #adulting
1541 2018-04-02 20:40:31 Paid rent and got an oil change.... adulting.
1542 2018-04-02 20:40:26 たらこって美味いよな！
1543 2018-04-02 20:40:23 That 200 is heavily biased upward due to the 417 data point. The 417 is almost exclusively due to the oil slump
1544 2018-04-02 20:40:22 I didn’t buy his snake oil
1545 2018-04-02 20:40:16 Ok PSA!!! I found the best way to get rid of those annoying ass piercing bumps. Tea tree oil!!!!! Put a TINY amount on a q tip and then run water on the q tip for 5 seconds. Do it twice a day and you’ll see results

1550 2018-04-02 20:39:41 My Dad worked for an oil company so we moved a lot and I continued the trend.
1551 2018-04-02 20:39:37 honestly you don't even need to dress it up, you can steam it then grill it with some garlic, olive oil and parsley. You don't even need the garlic and parsley shit just tastes good lmao

1561 2018-04-02 20:37:47 Amazing!
1562 2018-04-02 20:37:44 It's really alot simpler: Trump wants to keep oil prices as high as possible for his sponsors in Russia and Texas.
1563 2018-04-02 20:37:44 I would argue, as an argumentative lay man and not an expert, olive oil would be as 'beneficial' and 'essential' as coconut?
1564 2018-04-02 20:37:39 احترقت شقه وهم نايمين فيها
1565 2018-04-02 20:37:39 Haters gonna hate. Oil hates you. Oil owns everything. Oil writes disparagement about you and not themselves.
1566 2018-04-02 20:37:28 JASHSHZGSGXHSD JINS USED OIL PAPER
1567 2018-04-02 20:37:26 Did you ever notice the that the only job you forgot to do is always described by your partner as ‘the one job you had to do’ no matter how many jobs you did that day?

Unrelated note : We’re out of oil.
1568 2018-04-02 20:37:13 Instead of Greek Yogurt, use 1 cup water + 2 Tbsp. coconut oil or 1 cup coconut water in your Green Smoothie. #lesscalories #nomucous #vegan
1569 2018-04-02 20:37:12 Between @JasonMaline and I, you have two well-versed oil experts. Ask away.
1570 2018-04-02 20:37:06 Is this what @therealroseanne wanted from Trump?  That we all drive dirtier cars making more pollution and end up paying a good chunk of our wages to the oil companies so they own us and are especially hard on the working class?  Just askin because it sounds self destructive.
1571 2018-04-02 20:37:04 Didn’t buy the oil painting of a sad clown leaning against a street lamp from the garage sale and now deeply regretting my decision
1572 2018-04-02 20:36:53 I walked into my old Jeep store to get my oil changed and my GM saw me and said “aww you see that boomerang I threw last month is about to come back, when are you starting again” fuck I missed that place.
1573 2018-04-02 20:36:43 I can't believe I'm stranded in George West trying to change my oil for the first time ever the same week I had to deal with a flat tire. I'm in hell
1574 2018-04-02 20:36:38 just as well, ethanol is a net energy loser that uses oil and natural gas to create it while damaging the soil
1575 2018-04-02 20:36:31 That's exciting news. I'm excited to see John Noble tonight. Who could forget him as the Steward of Gondor. "Bring wood and oil."
1576 2018-04-02 20:36:23 Pruitt, one of the most dishonest members of the Trump Admin, was hired for that very reason. A head of the EPA, who is KNOWN to be on the payroll of Big Oil, is the very height of cynicism and hypocrisy. Trump knew just what he was getting when he picked Pruitt, a CRIMINAL!
1577 2018-04-02 20:36:16 just read in the paper that Legalizing CBD OIL for medical never received a Senate Commite hearing. Passed the House 59-11 but Health and welfare chairman Lee Heider declined to schedule Senate Commite hearing.
1578 2018-04-02 20:36:15 One more thing so treason trump can benefit from oil! Ruin our environment for the almighty dollar!
1579 2018-04-02 20:36:13 TY.
1580 2018-04-02 20:36:11 I make Margherita pizzas at home. The basil is too expensive; the flours (!?), tomato sauce, olive oil, and cheese too cheap. They're clearly not using San Marzano -- and why no Parmesan or Romano?
So, besides everything else, it's not going to be a very good pizza.
1581 2018-04-02 20:36:09 Yeah I was hearing that too :( I'm excited to try the hemp oil!
1582 2018-04-02 20:36:02 1) They brand themselves as “dressing” and 2) Apparently it doesn’t have a high enough oil content to count as mayonnaise
1583 2018-04-02 20:35:53 My guess is that Scott wants to prop up the flagging oil companies with less fuel efficiency. Pay more at the pumps!

1586 2018-04-02 20:35:13 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1587 2018-04-02 20:34:56 And its snake oil time to pretend anyone disbelieves it. The £ reduces as the market decided we're diminishing ourselves.

1600 2018-04-02 20:33:06 You're living proof that in this day and age snake oil sales people can still make a living!
1601 2018-04-02 20:32:57 Add some sunflower oil and a bit of emulsifier to the water and you basically have milk.
1602 2018-04-02 20:32:46 i need a massage i got the coconut oil too 
1603 2018-04-02 20:32:38 *add Into the Badlands to my list*
1604 2018-04-02 20:32:30 I’m still short Oil, but closed out all my equity shorts today at close. I’m not thinking long quite yet but now open to the idea.
1605 2018-04-02 20:32:21 I googled some stuff and it said stimulate your nipples with olive oil 
1606 2018-04-02 20:32:16 Lol no please no oil. The butter is just to make the skin crispy. It's good you can cook though, congratulations 
1607 2018-04-02 20:32:14 But crude oil was over 100 dollar per barrrel under GEJ and he depleted our reserves to 29billion and still borrowed to pay salaries na. There is nothing wrong in borrowing for infrastructure.  Our debt to GDP ratio is still good
1608 2018-04-02 20:32:11 I live in WY. They are trying to compete with Puerto Rico.
Oil and coal revenues going down, so they are looking for alternatives.
1609 2018-04-02 20:32:04 np  & me too they always irritate my eyes & face!  i used coconut oil forever & then i found out it's really heavy/clogs your pores 
1610 2018-04-02 20:32:00 another mushroom stir fry with onion, cashews, garlic, pineapple, yellow pepper and jalapeno. oil, veges, salt, black pepper, soy sauce and brown sugar, cooked on high till it all reduces.. tangy sweet with a mild spice
1611 2018-04-02 20:32:00 It won't have been a miracle, it will have been the 1:2:4 ratio of tea tree, lavender, and olive oil that you bathe in.
1612 2018-04-02 20:31:51 ~3cups self rising flour
~1 teaspoon baking powder
~1 teaspoon salt
~4 teaspoon sugar 
~2 Tablespoons room tempature butter
~1 cup water 
Take all those ingredients above and mix that ish in a bowl until you have a nice dough ball, dry ingredients first, then wet.
~oil for frying
1613 2018-04-02 20:31:33 what’s the point in making an appointment for an oil change if i’m still gonna sit here for an hour 
1614 2018-04-02 20:31:24 Who has tried CBD oil either in a vape pen, ingesting it or any other method for recovery?
If so where from and what brand?
1615 2018-04-02 20:31:07 Pruitt is an Oklahoman seeped in the religious belief that God gave man dominion over the earth and its destruction hastens the arrival of the rapture, he's also been in pocket of the oil and gas industry since his first days in politics, he's basically a corrupt bible thumper
1616 2018-04-02 20:31:05 It baffles me that some people pay $60 to get their oil changed  but I’m the dumb one for not going to college my bad
1617 2018-04-02 20:31:02 Hey uh no big deal but my essential oil diffuser is possibly the most amazing thing ever and also my room smells like Catholic Church now oops
1618 2018-04-02 20:31:00 Don’t feel like getting an oil change today, but I also probably shouldn’t put it off any longer.
1619 2018-04-02 20:30:34 Yessss girl!!!!! Oil free and longwear lipsticks you are SET!
1620 2018-04-02 20:30:33 Misclicking on the Decemberists instead of an oil change.
1621 2018-04-02 20:30:20 Are pipelines bucking up over the oil being too light? 90° gravity is pretty gassy in my book

1623 2018-04-02 20:30:02 Yes I support the teachers and more funds for public education but most of these people voted Republican who then gave our tax money to the oil companies. No excuse. We should be a rich state with all this oil. Shame!
1624 2018-04-02 20:29:57 Yep...we always back down!
Sickening bunch of pussys we are! The left knows we don’t have the balls to push back. The squeaky wheel gets the oil!...especially when a cowardly republican is the grease-monkey.
1625 2018-04-02 20:29:50 When the plug as an oil cart waiting for you when you leave the office 
1626 2018-04-02 20:29:39 so thats the one you picked , i await the people rising against the cuts THEIR Government will implement on them . Then a Terrorist army to fight you .
Here we go again who has the most oil for us then Boris , will they need a military army soon
1627 2018-04-02 20:29:33 No greedy oil companies are doing that
1628 2018-04-02 20:29:32 Whale oil sales are down because of Amazon
1629 2018-04-02 20:29:23 You should! Just use a lot of coconut oil so it doesn’t get damaged
1630 2018-04-02 20:29:21 Gane okay fish oil keh 
1631 2018-04-02 20:29:17 You are on the ground there. Do you think anyone - whether named Notley or not - can turn that oil tanker around in less than one term? Dreamer!
1632 2018-04-02 20:29:09 All of the technology that is needed to transition to being less dependent on oil exists and is in production, much by Canadian companies. If the Liberals actually cared, Cath would have been sending out feelers from day one to implement pilot projects. What has she done? Whine.
1633 2018-04-02 20:29:00 See, the butter takes place of the oil, right ? Girl i kno my way around a kitchen too hehehe .  just thought putting shit in the oven was simpler for any female. And i loooove garlic! Grind a lil ginger too
1634 2018-04-02 20:28:44 Im tryin’ to get an oil change.. my sister told me hit the e-way and go to the one off whatever exit. Whyyyy is this muthafucka packed!!
1635 2018-04-02 20:28:20 Who is "Us"?  You & me?  Perhaps.  Other nuclear-armed powers that supply the world with goods & oil?  Perhaps they have a say in the game's outcome, no?
1636 2018-04-02 20:27:52 GDP "contracted 0.1 per cent during the month... after leading the Group of Seven in growth last year." Statistics Canada cited a 7.1% reduction in oil sands production due to unscheduled maintenance shutdowns & falling real estate activity... #Context
1637 2018-04-02 20:27:44 Usually a side effect of too much MCT oil
1638 2018-04-02 20:27:40 Not one of them was profitable, led by the liar scargill the miners priced themselves out of work .btw in 1981 thatcher paid british industries a subsidy of £50 million to use the more expensive coal , over cheap north sea oil and still they failed.
1639 2018-04-02 20:27:36 Putin wants to control as much Middle Eastern oil and gas reserves as Trump is able to help him acquire.
1640 2018-04-02 20:27:20 Anything that encourages higher oil prices is good for Putin's exports.

1642 2018-04-02 20:27:11 I’ve heard there has been research proving that using gloves is typically less sanitary because people don’t change gloves often enough and even when they do they don’t wash their hands before the new pair. This causes oil to come through the gloves. But I haven’t researched.
1643 2018-04-02 20:27:10 You hate government? You must own your own backroads. You must not have sent your kids to the public school where you went. You must have well water too. (remember not to dump the motor oil in the yard!)

1674 2018-04-02 20:23:01 Because, killing kids protects us all. Not. This warring over oil needs to end.
1675 2018-04-02 20:22:48 Would you rather have Oil consumption or A steering system for a work machine having a hydrostatic transmission is disclosed?

1677 2018-04-02 20:22:42 Ja , put the oil in de lamp...:)
1678 2018-04-02 20:22:40 Shout outs to @Uncle_Malik. His beard butter & oil is the double truth ruth
1679 2018-04-02 20:22:35 #Bahrain Hey thanks for telling us about that oil, America will be right over to collect what is rightfully ours!
1680 2018-04-02 20:22:15 Then when trunp hands over Syria, Iraq et al to Russia - more big ruble deposits off-shore. Rexxon/Russia oil deal - $billions in bribes!
1681 2018-04-02 20:22:14 Would you happen to know if the public practice at Lucas Oil Stadium is returning this year? My son and I love driving from Cincy for it.
1682 2018-04-02 20:22:05 Day off work, so I did some of the winter/spring necesaries. Swapped the snow tires off my wife's old car; changed the oil, drained the gas out of the snowblower, and gave the external moving parts a shot of WD40. 

Pretty good chance we'll get a dump of snow now.
1683 2018-04-02 20:22:01 ooh so that's the brand name, alright
I was wondering about... oil for ACTUAL axes for whatever reason lol
1684 2018-04-02 20:21:47 for anyone who cares/doesn’t know after you shave your legs rub some light sesame oil or olive oil or coconut oil whatever tf on your freshly shaved legs, get one of them cheap ass razors and shave again. all that dead skin come off and yo legs be softer than baby jesus
1685 2018-04-02 20:21:40 Well-regulated= gun control. You can’t own lawn darts. You can’t paint kids toys with lead paint. You ain’t supposed to dump your used motor oil in your yard or you’ll be drinking it later... regulation. Regulation. Regulation. 2A mentions no AR-15s. Bc they weren’t invented yet.
1686 2018-04-02 20:21:38 Keep driving and take Lankford with you.  He could care less about OK small business. All he cares about are his oil/gas buddy's & robbing OK blind with tax breaks. Why does OK continue to give away our main resource, for practically nothing. OK, when is gone its gone & for 2%?

1691 2018-04-02 20:21:01 Mobile Oil responded by stating that the CEO was having a mental breakdown at the time, but it was kept secret for the sake of the shareholders.
1692 2018-04-02 20:20:59 Nah same my hair used to get very oily but that’s what washing your hair too often does to it! If you slowly start washing it less it’ll begin to produce less oil trust me x
1693 2018-04-02 20:20:58 Bruh I got transmission oil all over my clothes and face!! I’m HOT !!
1694 2018-04-02 20:20:46 In the beginning they did not have oil nor gas, check out now, thing have changed a bit, who controls the biz??
1695 2018-04-02 20:20:38 I lived in So ILL for a few years when my old man was drilling oil wells there. That’s where I discovered the joy of porkburgers. My man @franksskintags knows the score on that delicacy.

1. Cook the onions, carrots and celery in oil until softened. Add the spices. Let cook 5-8 minutes. 

2. Add tomatoes and juice. Let cook for 12 minutes till you get a thick sauce.

1698 2018-04-02 20:19:51 He’s a great fable: an Okie icon and exemplar of the working class who was swiftly emasculated (literally, with chisel and belt sander) by scandalized moral majoritarians that rely on his ilk to prop up the oil economy and their own privilege
1699 2018-04-02 20:19:36 It's not a bad thing , it means we're going in the right direction , but what was asked for , is what will be given . Which one will you rather have , oil industries GPT 5% or livable wages for teachers , higher education funding , and raises for support staff ?
1700 2018-04-02 20:19:31 Ok thank you!! I definitely want to try. I hate makeup removers. I try and use coconut oil.
1701 2018-04-02 20:19:31 I don't like the term "baby oil"
Sounds gross.
1702 2018-04-02 20:19:28 Yes! I use it too my skin is clearer and feels amazing. I love the serum and oil. You look lovely babe.
1703 2018-04-02 20:19:13 Come to think of it, I think the West and the East fighting over oil reserves in the Middle east may play a key role in the battle of the Religions.
1704 2018-04-02 20:19:11 How about when a recipe says to fry something in 1 Tbsp oil when it always takes much more...
1705 2018-04-02 20:19:07 OH, I HAVE VIEWS (imagine your surprise). Short pastry does not need to be rolled out or indeed rested at all. No point in caramelising meat for stews. You don't need oil to fry salmon fillets. Don't salt roasting veg.

1707 2018-04-02 20:18:56 Does it contain oil? Or possibly oils ?
1708 2018-04-02 20:18:53 I remember growing up poor in Louisiana during the oil crises. We all packed our lunches and had reusable thermoses and we refilled them all the time at school. And today I struggle to keep that mindset.

1718 2018-04-02 20:16:49 Non! Cher bon Dieu!

1725 2018-04-02 20:16:16 coconut oil is comedogenic & will actually attract bacteria to your skin. It’s the same reason why people do coconut oil pulls for mouth bacteria (but they rinse it out) You’re skin may not be prone to breakouts which is why you’re fine but it’s very very bad for sensitive skin

1727 2018-04-02 20:15:57 favourite Oliver Reed quote:

I’d much rather end up a fertiliser under a sunflower which is eventually made into sunflower seed oil so that instead of nibbling me in her prawn cocktail, the pretty girl will rub me on her bristols as she suns herself on a beach in the Caribbean
1728 2018-04-02 20:15:45 Pretty good. It's like a thicker and tastier cottage cheese. I put salt and oilive oil and spread it on toast
1729 2018-04-02 20:14:48 Absolutely! Ghee is a fantastic substitute for butter/ coconut oil when cooking or baking  Higher smoke point & delicious buttery nutty flavour 
1730 2018-04-02 20:14:39 Because becoming a net oil exporter is too good. Lets become reliant on OPEC again. Mema the good ol' days?
1731 2018-04-02 20:14:29 “rise in earthquakes can be attributed to injection of large quantities of wastewater into wells deep below Earth's surface. Per USGS, most wastewater comes from oil/gas operations-created when clean water mixes w/dirt, metals & other toxins during extraction operations.”
1732 2018-04-02 20:14:17 As long as it doesn't turn into a debate. I have little trust for antis/SAS who align w big oil $ to end demand.
1733 2018-04-02 20:14:13 Nice to know you have an electric car. I can't afford one!  

Oil consumption reached a new high in 2017 at 100,000,000 barrels a day!
1734 2018-04-02 20:14:10 i mean if you really want to preserve the integrity of the whiskey's bouquet you want to use an extra virgin olive oil of equivalent cost

1738 2018-04-02 20:13:49 So, as I'm on 115,000 miles, you can imagine the number of oil changes I've had, all under the caring and watchful gaze of the kind folks at International Autos. Still, at the moment, there's some funky funk going on so they suggested I give it some oil meself.
1739 2018-04-02 20:13:38 I agree with you, here in NY we do have medical marijuana (CBD Oil) however there is a push to set up safe locations to provide clean needles etc to shoot up, thus continuing enabling the addiction of Heroin use along with handing  Narcan to family members to reverse the overdose
1740 2018-04-02 20:13:29 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

1749 2018-04-02 20:12:52 You're out touch. The pull back in gold was a reflection of Trump and policy to support a stronger dollar. People have stopped buying the    story and the BS with it.

1756 2018-04-02 20:12:02 It was. And we have watched McDavid eat slashes like that uncalled all year. I get the frustration too. Flames have no one to keep other team in line. Oil were like that for years
1757 2018-04-02 20:11:30 Girl, that's like the main rule of curls  your hair gets dry and frizzy right after washing! The oil production over a couple days brings down the frizz and gives it shine!
1758 2018-04-02 20:11:19 Well, I'm good overall, on the car. It's very well tended to, but, on the MINI, made by BMW, oil changes are only required every 15,000 miles. At the moment, I am very much in between on that cycle, one to which I have adhered all these 16 years.
1759 2018-04-02 20:11:17 Too bad the teachers didn't get huge tax cuts like the wealthiest people in their state. Maybe the oil co execs, who made a killing on corporate & personal tax cuts, could help the teachers out. Or is it that a well educated populace represents a danger to the GOP agenda?

1802 2018-04-02 20:06:41 quote My wife is one of those teachers that are walking out today and will be at the Capitol with sign in hand.

1803 2018-04-02 20:06:39 high-efficiency machines use less fuel. Less fuel sales = loss of oil money. 
Low-efficiency machines will use more fuel. they reap the rewards from more oil product sales. also costs money to test and regulate. All the tiny cuts are what they’re adding up to cover the tax bill
1804 2018-04-02 20:06:33 Tweeps, I need an up-to-date oil sands tailings volume estimate. Latest AER or AB Govt, please. Link?
1805 2018-04-02 20:06:28 roasted sausages with quartered red onions and Gala apples.Toss the best links you can find with olive oil, the apples and onions, some mustard seeds, dried thyme and a little flaky salt, then roast it all at 400 for around an hour. “Serves four.”

1819 2018-04-02 20:04:10 When you’re just waiting to get your oil changed & some girl in the waiting room is on the phone with it on speaker , WHY
1820 2018-04-02 20:04:09 Nope. That’s not ingenuity. Breaking down human habits and emotions into demographics to sell them shit they don’t need is what snake oil salesman did through instinct years ago.
1821 2018-04-02 20:04:09 Oil can be burned and produce valuable things like energy and heat. That shitcoin can only operate a contrived system specifically made for it to look like it is needed, but can actually run on any centralized token. Pointless.

1824 2018-04-02 20:03:57 was there not a bill passed this or last year that puts some portion of GPT into a kind of rainy day fund to be used on leaner oil years?
1825 2018-04-02 20:03:55 Here in Massachusetts we pay $640,000 a year to be independently ranked internationally from the United States. We always land in the top 10 and often in the top five. We need talent here, we don't have oil wells..
1826 2018-04-02 20:03:51 This isn’t new either. In the 60s we lost ground to the Europeans. During the oil crisis, big American cars lost tremendous ground to much more efficient and better built Japanese cars.
1827 2018-04-02 20:03:48 Well, the piece is metal (bonds to a magnet) yet cannot locate source (still soaking up the oil - too messy to crawl under). You may be correct though. Not much else it could be.

Ahhh, if so, the ancient dilemma, swap it out or scrap. Is clean but an 03. Wife's favorite.
1828 2018-04-02 20:03:47 Oh in a baking tray in the oven, innit............. Goose fat, butter and olive oil.

1864 2018-04-02 20:00:30 @gravybote This attack is a result of Western Media spreading hate for muslims & Islam for oil quest in the muslim countries, it is easy to blame it on Islam for genocide U.S, British doing for oil quest.  How many people know the true cause of conflicts or know Islam? not many.

1872 2018-04-02 19:59:26 Valid point Don, I respect your opinion.

What if, a year from now, Oil end up where they were this time a year ago and Kessler is to old, broken and slow to get to Talbot’s pad in time?

I’m sure you would agree that too would be on Nicholson, Chiarelli and McLellan!

1894 2018-04-02 19:58:12 What do you think about a commodity appcoin like safecoin, created by proof of resource: bandwidth and decentralized cloud storage?

1938 2018-04-02 19:51:55 Largely because US unconventional oil is ultra light and had to be either blended or exported for refining.
1939 2018-04-02 19:51:31 Ah that's not to difficult then. I suggest using kale as your base (roughly sliced) tossed in a little oil and salt, along with some brown rice to bulk it up (has a decent amount of fibre), let's go with black beans and then some red pepper. if you like you can add a protein
1940 2018-04-02 19:51:29 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
1941 2018-04-02 19:51:14 And a 7.5% GPT on gas, and 4.5% on oil (which brought in a combined $3B in FY '17). Sales tax represents 26% of their budget. Plus, they make up for all of those other missing taxes by hitting all 268,000 square miles of land with a stiff property tax.
1942 2018-04-02 19:51:11 Is Trump burning the OIL FIELDS before Impeachment?

1945 2018-04-02 19:51:00 Orange essential oil and sunshine. These people acting crazy because of this full blue moon will not damper my day

1947 2018-04-02 19:50:50 You’re a tool and the world is laughing at you and will judge you harshly - enjoy your last week on the job at your cheap apartment. You are supposed to protect the environment, not your oil and gas buddies.
1948 2018-04-02 19:50:43 ي حظك لو انا منك نزلت اصور فهد ال حركان
1949 2018-04-02 19:50:42 Why do you hate the environment you are supposed to protect? Everyday is opposite day in Trump's swamp. Do you drink oil with your meals? Gasoline? Do you pump your exhaust into your home? Do you spray glyphosate on your food just for kicks?
1950 2018-04-02 19:50:40 Oklahoma, an oil state gives huge tax breaks to oil companies. Take some of that and FULLY fund teachers salaries and students.
1951 2018-04-02 19:50:27 It is a snake oil. Don't buy it.
1952 2018-04-02 19:50:25 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
1953 2018-04-02 19:50:24 I will still buy based on economy as gas and oil is a finite resource and will spike greatly soon. Think of the taxes to run school busses alone in 20 years. Financially unsustainable.
1954 2018-04-02 19:50:14 To be honest it already was dangerous !! as until 2020 it is still legal for ships to wash out their cargo bay of Palm Oil in Liverpool Bay/ Irish Sea after unloading at Liverpool !!!
1955 2018-04-02 19:50:09 bio oil
1956 2018-04-02 19:50:08 Vicious cycle of bio oil helping my acne scars but the oil making me spotty :( can’t win
1957 2018-04-02 19:50:07 I goes hot oil is the next treatment?  Wow some fellas never learn.
1958 2018-04-02 19:49:54 Near-monopoly: industrial testing (oil on tank ships, for example): SGS Societe Generale de Surveillance, 70-90% market share in some areas
1959 2018-04-02 19:49:45 People who lived there. Minerals and oil under its territories &  gateway/outpost to the southern hemisphere. 
Do you need any other reason?
1960 2018-04-02 19:49:43 On them? How is this on those workers im the mountains? Both parties have failed my state for the last 100 years. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have sold snake oil to us for too long. It is on them not our people.
1961 2018-04-02 19:49:27 Watching a 30 minute YouTube video of a bloke in Nottingham change the oil filter on a 2004 CBR600f is a new low for me.
1962 2018-04-02 19:49:27 اسالي وش يرجعون
1963 2018-04-02 19:49:26 I mean... I think the president should be allowed to claim oil companies are going to kill us all with global warming. Not all companies deserve to exist, and politics should be allowed to reflect on that
1964 2018-04-02 19:49:17 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
1965 2018-04-02 19:49:08 Platinum oil..best tan lotion on planet..
1966 2018-04-02 19:49:06 Apparently so-seems he’s deep in the pocket of big oil companies
1967 2018-04-02 19:49:04 Some people aren't very happy with the oil pumps & war machines idling for so long.
1968 2018-04-02 19:49:01 My mom sends me to get her oil change and wheels rotation when I could save 120$ and do it my self 
1969 2018-04-02 19:48:59 How may litres of oil you use cook stew....chei
1970 2018-04-02 19:48:37 Leftover Easter eggs? Make California deviled eggs: whip hard-boiled egg yolk with avo, olive oil, sea salt & sriracha. Fill hard-boiled egg white with mix & sprinkle with chilito (lime/chile mix - @RanchoGordo makes a tasty one). Enjoy!

1975 2018-04-02 19:47:58 I heard olive oil is good? 
1976 2018-04-02 19:47:52 My styrofoam got more oil than Dubai
1977 2018-04-02 19:47:49 All the politicians care about in Oklahoma is getting the oil out of the ground!
1978 2018-04-02 19:47:49 These news reporters from Sinclair broadcasting are only the messages from that disgraceful pod Miller who guides trumpy on his immigration ignorance. You want democracy? Get these snake oil salesmen out of office.
1979 2018-04-02 19:47:43 There is only one thing that makes this world go round: GOD. (Guns, Oil, Dollars)
1980 2018-04-02 19:47:42 We’re for sure on drc. It’s where I go to get info after the race that I might have missed. We’re going to have a site up soon as well. We get a lot of great coverage on the @Lucas_Oil show and the announcers know our class better than the pro announcers. And of course @WFORadio!
1981 2018-04-02 19:47:36 The oil and gas industry loves the idea of "deliverables." Everything starts with a list of deliverables. Then the deliverables are delivered in the 200 pages after that. It's just a fuckin table of contents.
1982 2018-04-02 19:47:29 Point taken - I actually own an older motorhome with a 400 cubic inch Dodge big block that I use for dirt road fishing  trips, so I'm actually familiar with these motors. (I loved the external oil pump location when I had to replace it!)
Hemi powered just sounds better 
1983 2018-04-02 19:47:16 It's still KFC. All of that fat and oil is VERY BAD for your arteries. It doesn't matter at that point. Any benefit from a meatless option is null and void.

Dear vegans, 

Don't eat fried foods. They are bad for you.
1984 2018-04-02 19:46:52 Lmaoo when they’re dirty or it’s been a while since moisturized. Tea tree oil and a good dread detox will have them soft as poodle fur 
1985 2018-04-02 19:46:46 add oil but dont sleep TOO late la (as if it isnt too late already loll)

1989 2018-04-02 19:46:23 Al Gore can kiss my ass. Why aren’t you talking about the civil suit that Cain filed against 5 oil co’s?
1990 2018-04-02 19:46:07 Regulation can destroy good cos..Indian eg..Bharti airtel..Latest eg.. Amazon....My take..Stay with good businesses..Mkt will remain downwards..As $ firm..Oil up..Also politicial risk and global slowdown can come due to trade war and high int rates..Most factors negative
1991 2018-04-02 19:46:01 I'm proud of myself. We stopped at Taco Bell after I got my oil changed to see babe and to get drinks and I didn't even get food 
1992 2018-04-02 19:46:01 Water, Aloe Vera, coconut oil...repeat 
1993 2018-04-02 19:45:59 Tax the rich and oil companies. They won't lay anyone off.record profits and tax breaks- bs.
1994 2018-04-02 19:45:49 What do oil company profits, a boycott of the NRA, and the #oklahomateacherwalkout have to do with one another?  Where's the link?  No wonder student test scores are so low in OK.
1995 2018-04-02 19:45:43 I am not sure I would call you independent.... NO ONE associated with the Oil Business is truly independent... right boys and girls ...
1996 2018-04-02 19:45:34 Take small steps, don’t try to do it all at once! Plastics, palm oil, non ethical fashion - it’s hard to avoid everything, so pick the one you’re most passionate about and tackle that first! #EthicalHour
1997 2018-04-02 19:45:33 Castor oil can do that?? Thank you !

1999 2018-04-02 19:45:24 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2000 2018-04-02 19:45:23 Check your Engine oil today.
2001 2018-04-02 19:45:21 Do you know the technique to use a piece of bread to finish all the gravy?
You can do it with the plastic too. Nuln oil only.

2003 2018-04-02 19:45:15 Baby oil, hair conditioner, soap
2004 2018-04-02 19:45:11 Hot oil treatments are great for moisturizing hair, controlling frizz, and smoothing. I usually do mine with castor oil, avocado oil, coconut oil and olive oil
2005 2018-04-02 19:44:52 This hurts consumers, the environment, and even the carmakers as they won't be able to sell their cars overseas anymore (just like what happened in 2007-08). It helps oil companies though, so theres that...
2006 2018-04-02 19:44:40 @PierrePoilievre the snake oil salesman, how much will your plan cost? if you have any. And by way quit the school boy economics. They paint you in really bad light leaving your readers and listeners who not conservative baffled about your sanity.
2007 2018-04-02 19:44:40 sunflower oil works too

Cooking for youke tswafa so nna!!
2008 2018-04-02 19:44:35 I know about the US cutting Japan’s oil. 

Did u support the war because u thought Iraq were a future threat? What  was your reason?

What does this mean “should leave the government in place because it's  the government privileges the state in a really weird way”?
2009 2018-04-02 19:44:34 And I was responding to your post. If you exclude the oil-rich and the low-population-with-exceptional-sector countries, you're left with... nothing. And the UK's oil is reducing and we have a massive population.
2010 2018-04-02 19:44:34 I tend to use castor oil, then I wear a durag for the the night, then I use my hands to press my hair down a couple of times
2011 2018-04-02 19:44:25 So i purchased a bottle of CBD oil- lets see if this stuff helps me calm tf down lol
2012 2018-04-02 19:44:23 Lol go ahead and rack up on more coco butter and baby oil so that melanin can be popping
2013 2018-04-02 19:44:20 It’s just chick peas with olive oil and salt so it should be. Read the ingredients. I’m not vegan but trying to incorporate more plant based foods and finding that reading the labels is key.
2014 2018-04-02 19:44:16 But you have time for Montreal to dump raw sewage in the St. Lawrence ? And you have time for Middle East oil to be imported in from countries with no climate targets ? I’d say their is a growing number of Canadians that are tired of being dictated to by this govt.
2015 2018-04-02 19:44:14 Serious ooh.. We would have to even pour a gallon of anointing oil on you
2016 2018-04-02 19:44:07 The brand is “Lighlife,” and it’s ground “Mexican crumbles” basically fake ground beef. I browned it in the skillet for like 5 mins w olive oil. Popped a (little) cheese on it. Added lettuce and verde salsa...straight fire. Tastes really close to real ground beef!
2017 2018-04-02 19:43:58 Without oil money, you wouldnt be a top 6 side and that's a fact. Without oil money, we wouldn't be a top 10 side. So let us all gather and praise oil. All hail oil, I'll let you lead the rituals big brother
2018 2018-04-02 19:43:45 I support pipelines, Canada's oil & gas industry's ethically and environmentally responsible products to open market (which is now controlled by their only customer: USA), rights for all individuals, including those who are different than me... But, I don't support dogmatic bs.
2019 2018-04-02 19:43:42 There is no "low oil price". W. Canadian Select is cheaper than WTI because it's sticky, mucky, low api tar that has to be processed before it can be used for anything other than paving roads.
If the "job creators" wanted to do  you a solid, they'd build a refinery, not a pipe.

2022 2018-04-02 19:43:21 the kettle calling the pot black...what do you call the American policy in the middle east for oil? Sainthood?
2023 2018-04-02 19:43:16 We hope so..not only our schools are suffering so is our State Troopers. They are only allowed to drive a set number of miles per shift, and a set amount of gas..we are an oil and gas rich state. They are not allowed to hire more troopers..Not in the budget. Short staffed longhrs
2024 2018-04-02 19:43:04 I walked to Sjs while I got my oil changed, & when I went to get my car Tuki came with me.Tuki sat next to me the entire time, till the man approached her so she tried to “puppy hug” he was like that’s bad manners.Well fam saying 1 hour when it took 2 is also bad manners
2025 2018-04-02 19:42:59 Thats roughly $1.15 B a year

$23.2 B. a year SENT TO MEXICO from US
2026 2018-04-02 19:42:56 These standards are beneficial to the consumer.  Who doesn't want a car that gets better gas mileage? All this does is help the oil and gas industry. Lower gas mileage is the future. Nothing this administration does makes any sense!

2029 2018-04-02 19:42:22 use them all the time to mark bolts when torquing them, write oil change stickers, write on boxes etc.
2030 2018-04-02 19:42:21 They are afraid of Tesla and the future.. Big oil companies have a monopoly on society including media
2031 2018-04-02 19:41:40 ...oil take that! 
2032 2018-04-02 19:41:22 Because they are snakes with big oil interests
2033 2018-04-02 19:41:13 (2 of 3)  Tesla does not advertise. The other automakers and the oil industry advertise heavily. Yet stories about innovative Tesla and its visionary CEO are sure to draw many clicks (eyeballs that buy advertised products).

The oil tycoon Koch brothers pay the media to publish
2034 2018-04-02 19:41:03 U.S. crude oil falls most in seven weeks
2035 2018-04-02 19:40:51 I used the Serious Eats cod pieces batter. 1:1:1 flour, cornstarch, milk. Baking powder, salt, spices; let rest 20min before use. Hotter oil than we used (leftover bacon + beef burger grease).
2036 2018-04-02 19:40:47 means to improve fuel efficiency and help oil revenues.
2037 2018-04-02 19:40:42 Oil on moleskin?
2038 2018-04-02 19:40:33 The Ayatollah’s have culture, class, and intellect. Wahhabists have oil and weapons. Guess which one the west favours more.

Most of religios people don't bother themselves with thinking .
The middle east situation is an exact proof of @jokraniareflex1 's word .
If they didn't have Oil they would have been starving now .
2041 2018-04-02 19:40:27 Being a natural who can’t use coconut oil is a TRUE struggle.

2043 2018-04-02 19:39:58 I'm sure it has nothing to do with the owners and financiers of the news outlets being oil giants...
2044 2018-04-02 19:39:58 part 14 American Greed could discuss how pollution from coal, oil has increased by trillions of dollars over time the costs  of Medicare, Medicaid, health insurance companies, Social Security, Social Security disability, food stamps, etc
2045 2018-04-02 19:39:52 Garlic and olive oil then? Then dip bread in it?

2049 2018-04-02 19:39:26 The poster formerly known as Oil Baron?
2050 2018-04-02 19:39:16 And oil and gas.
2051 2018-04-02 19:38:58 
2052 2018-04-02 19:38:54 Lmao I was going to get his oil changed for him while he was at work
2053 2018-04-02 19:38:49 They are jealous of you. And with Tesla being on top, you are an easy target. Like oil companies in canada.
2054 2018-04-02 19:38:46 "DUDES" that wear leggings at the gym probably can't drive a stick shift or change their own oil! Wonder if their string irritates them while working out?
2055 2018-04-02 19:38:40 Lies. Everything out of this snake oil salesman’s mouth is a lie.

2057 2018-04-02 19:38:34 Oh... I’m so sorry your Mum is in pain. I’m sure you have, but if not, have you investigated CBD oil? [legal cannibinoid]. Many have remarkable results for pain. I found out too late for my darling Mum or I’d have had her on it like a shot, tbh. Can email info if interested. x

2066 2018-04-02 19:36:52 Same reason that you only hear about a auto crash death in a tesla. The media and its big oil supporters are trying to stop Tesla. I can’t wait to get a Tesla and show my support!
2067 2018-04-02 19:36:49 Bank account looks mighty rn but unfortunately you know, bills, tires, and oil are going to do some damage.
2068 2018-04-02 19:36:43 Just like you would do Spring maintenance around your house - don't forget your vehicle and equipment!  As the weather gets warmer it gets more and more important to have a tank full of clean, fresh oil.
2069 2018-04-02 19:36:42 Where's the coconut oil?
2070 2018-04-02 19:36:34 *OIL and gas
2071 2018-04-02 19:36:30 I have a friend who was on hospice more than 4 years. They only thought he had 6 months, but he still got the help when his tumor growth subsided.
 His long period of remission started and ended with a supply of whole plant cannibis oil. Went downhill as soon as he ran out.
2072 2018-04-02 19:36:18 There must be oil there or something.
2073 2018-04-02 19:36:17 Smart  the oil is one of the worst things I’ve tasted lmao
2074 2018-04-02 19:36:04 Put some Olive oil on his head like 2-3 drops my baby has the same and that helps him a lot

2077 2018-04-02 19:35:20 Well I'll give them one thing! I cant remember the last time I saw a volt meter & an oil temperature gauge in the main instrument cluster on a modern car - I guess with it being digital you can choose different readouts there?

2084 2018-04-02 19:34:23 It's open source. I encourage you to take a look. Look to their baseline assumptions on Elec and oil output (and source). Ask yourself if federal and provincial policies are all there.  That baseline is like no forecast every produced (well 2007 NEB). Why so high?
2085 2018-04-02 19:34:12 imagine life without olive oil

2097 2018-04-02 19:33:01 There're some protected sectors. Banking, telecoms(Telus), & aviation (WestJet operates in a protected market) to name a few. Unfortunately problem with oil is a lot more complicated than simply saying you should buy our oil. Alberta is producing more of oil that we can't use.
2098 2018-04-02 19:33:00 the answer is simple. OIL
2099 2018-04-02 19:32:55 I am working in Indian oil as an officer and serving my nation 24*7 and I've earned this job through hard work . I don't want my children in future to open their eyes in a country which provides freebies to ppl on the basis of caste rather than talent.

2104 2018-04-02 19:32:41 Oklahoma is run by big oil.  It pays by far the lowest tax rate (3.2%) of the oil producing states.  Florida is much better by comparison having moved to Oklahoma from Florida. Consider yourselves blessed.

2116 2018-04-02 19:30:38 Your people get blamed for everything @benshapiro. Might as well go nuts and do whatever since they're already blaming you.
2117 2018-04-02 19:30:37 They are still in business with and supported by private oil companies who aided in their acquiring power. The oil biz is run by the state...which is run by private corporations

2147 2018-04-02 19:26:58 Well it seems I'm not the one who wants it both ways. Free markets + less government intervention except when it comes to expectation that the East must buy expensive oil that we can't use in our refineries. Your own industry doesn't even believe that. Pipelines are for export...

2188 2018-04-02 19:22:59 .@AliVelshi Oil companies own congress teachers don't. That's why oil companies get the perks in #Oklahoma & teachers are under paid. Bottom line.

2212 2018-04-02 19:19:26 I’m not sure what you mean by draining the swamp .. Scott Pruitt and interior dude(can’t recall his name) the list goes on .. again we’re talking about two different views. Deregulated the banks and made our national parks oil fields. That’s not draining in my opinion.
2213 2018-04-02 19:19:17 Stash the ones you really can’t part with eg at work, donate the rest, thank your wife for decluttering by buying her a large bottle of Penhaligon’s bath oil. ( I’m not on their payroll; I just happen to like it).
2214 2018-04-02 19:19:17 Gotta get an oil change tomorrow
2215 2018-04-02 19:19:13 Khabib vs. Whoever won the last Kırkpınar. Oil included.
2216 2018-04-02 19:19:09 If bmw is that sorry, give each owner a coupon for 2 Free oil changes.
2217 2018-04-02 19:19:08 To cure impotence, dab marshmallow oil directly to the genitals.
2218 2018-04-02 19:19:08 Turns out, all the hype our parents and grandparents gave lwil Maskriti is real. I thought I’d be on the operating table again since last Friday. That castor oil compress+using my heating pad on top just took care of the pain & stomach we significantly down.
2219 2018-04-02 19:19:01 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
2220 2018-04-02 19:18:53 I drop a cod liver oil when I'm out in the club.
2221 2018-04-02 19:18:52 Tax payers pay the bills for wars. The oil companies and weapons makers get the benefits. Iraq is the best example. Tax payers are about the dumbest ever. Plain ass stupid.
2222 2018-04-02 19:18:52 @mmccdenier 

What most people don't realize is that plastics are made with oil

These days not much isn't made with at least some components made of plastic

2224 2018-04-02 19:18:38 Teachers.  Vote @GOP and get screwed!  We and oil companies need to pay MORE taxes to support our future!  The rich elite like Koch brothers and Mercer’s want to wreck our education system!  @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems @krassenstein @TeaPainUSA @missb62 @BillKristol @FoxNews
2225 2018-04-02 19:18:37 such a hot photo
2226 2018-04-02 19:18:34 Their reawakened dragon varnished by rose oil / anointed rose oil slithered into their flesh mitten
2227 2018-04-02 19:18:33 Well not quite since the people benefiting from our low oil price and lack of pipeline capacity are the US refiners and rail companies.
2228 2018-04-02 19:18:31 He should send US combat troops to protect Southern Border & Alaska as Russia is eyeing those oil reserves in northern Alaska. @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse

Productive day!!
2230 2018-04-02 19:18:13 what is best...killing inocent Iraqis for oil or using your box of match to fight against apartheid....holy americans.
2231 2018-04-02 19:18:09 Interesting spin boss but without the oil money City would be at best a mid table club.
2232 2018-04-02 19:17:58 Been changing oil since 12,for the plug you have tried,a lot infact.
I am honestly impressed.
2233 2018-04-02 19:17:50 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @KellyannePolls March quarter lowest in 2 years,growth in manufacturing slowing.Oil& farmers,your supporters getting hurt by tariffs. Markets hate uncertainty,& what next tweet might bring is uncertainty

2235 2018-04-02 19:17:21 JacksofAmerica "OverBoredGaming yay!!! I am one of the drops of oil causing that zit lol"
2236 2018-04-02 19:17:21 I don’t like trump either snowflake! There is no difference between your democrats & Republicans! They are bother the party of war, Wall Street and big oil.
2237 2018-04-02 19:17:19 I told this man at NTB that I have to be at PV today so he could move my car up in line to get an oil change & he looked at me like...wtf does that have to do w/ me... wow so inconsiderate
2238 2018-04-02 19:17:04 Meanwhile in Syria, we set entire cities on fire just for oil and power...
2239 2018-04-02 19:17:02 Thank you so much to everyone who tuned in and to the 7 new followers today! Sorry about my initial delay. Tomorrow's Stream should be on time! (Getting my oil changed in the morning) Tekken 7 Training is tomorrow! #CrescentRises @CrescentsGG
2240 2018-04-02 19:16:51 I just bought a cool new Xbox One The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Most clowns are just NSA spies in disguise! Never speak secrets to clowns!
2241 2018-04-02 19:16:46 5 more days and Ima be in a bikini  asking some random honey to spread some tanning oil on my backside like scuze meeee heyyyyy
2242 2018-04-02 19:16:41 Ukog will be the new BP by then!
2243 2018-04-02 19:16:39 Wondering about teachers married to or otherwise related to oil industry employees.  Paradoxical..
2244 2018-04-02 19:16:38 I’ve been taking the oil form but I’m switching to the pill form today lol
2245 2018-04-02 19:16:37 But also can’t change his oil, do his laundry or cook anything more sophisticated than a hot pocket, #millenialproblems
2246 2018-04-02 19:16:36 Check your advertising budget for WSJ and compare that with not other car companies but with oil companies
2247 2018-04-02 19:16:31 You're smarter than that, Steve. Income tax cuts we're mostly at the tail end of Gov. Henry, and current collections are up since then. Revenue cratered because of gas and then oil prices tanking. Not that complicated.
2248 2018-04-02 19:16:29 From the article you kindly shared: "Plus Costa Rica's primary industries are tourism and agriculture,"

Without oil the Costa Rican economy would implode overnight.
2249 2018-04-02 19:16:29 At least IRP(Lucas Oil Raceway) hosts the NHRA US Nationals and Gateway hosts Trucks still
2250 2018-04-02 19:16:27 The problem you have not addressed is government control of distribution of goods and services and the exchange of currency.  E.g. there was never a shortage of oil.
2251 2018-04-02 19:16:19 You still aren't making an argument you're just restating your opinion. I blame capitalism cuz like I've said, these regimes were implemented by private oil companies to boost their profit. So unless you can explain to me how oil companies are not capitalists, then I stand by it.
2252 2018-04-02 19:16:17 If you have some peppermint essential oil, you can rub that on your temple or wherever it hurts. Try to stay away from your eyes. It's going to burn for a while, but then it will get better.

2254 2018-04-02 19:16:00 How about increasing the proceeds from the lottery that goes to education to be higher than 35 percent?  Or increasing the gross production tax on oil and gas wells to be at levels of other states?  Or becoming more diversified in other industries other than oil?
2255 2018-04-02 19:15:56 Happy Monday!

2256 2018-04-02 19:15:53 Yep. 

It’s not the trade war that matters, it’s China buying oil with Yuan that matters.

2258 2018-04-02 19:15:41 I like it when she fires the machine gun in her bikini and falls off the oil rig #realism
2259 2018-04-02 19:15:12 I’m not seeing where the poster says they fund guns? I believe it says “we only love our oil and our guns”  don’t use my child to fuel your ignorance.
2260 2018-04-02 19:15:09 That shit be Necessary  RT @LesIzMore: @DatzMyDJ @CiciBettaCCMe I wonder how much baby oil they go through
2261 2018-04-02 19:15:08 Oil changed , car wash & my windows tinted #ILOVEMYBABY 
2262 2018-04-02 19:15:03 Coz its no longer holiday.. 

2 things i am grateful today. 

1. Workload is just 'enough' 
2. White tea + ginger essential oil on my humidifier 
3. I got a crush- a fictional character HAHHA
2263 2018-04-02 19:15:01 I believe you could be one step away from imitating your heroine!  You know all her good qualities not the murder, torture, embezzlement and just being a greedy snake oil saleswoman. But don't let that get in the way of story time
2264 2018-04-02 19:14:51 a scandalized bottle of oil is confirmed for secretary of Department of Education. Selfish!
2265 2018-04-02 19:14:49 Bit of danish oil on the handle... no?....
2266 2018-04-02 19:14:49 Dab marshmallow oil when you are journeying into the astral and wish some extra protection.
2267 2018-04-02 19:14:42 Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
2268 2018-04-02 19:14:39 I hate coming to get my oil changed bc then they find all these other things wrong with my car
2269 2018-04-02 19:14:37 US crude sinks 3%, settling at $63.01, as geopolitical anxiety that fueled a rally fades #energy #oil
2270 2018-04-02 19:14:34 Professor talking about assets traded on market: “whatever the asset is, whether it be oil or... uh... pork bellies”
2271 2018-04-02 19:14:33 UKSA were to facilitate the resupply of the UK with Food and Oil. The formation of the UKSA who, like PYTHON Groups, would relocate to separate highly classified wartime sites, enabled the PYTHON Groups to concentrate on the prosecution of the war & leave UKSA to resupply the UK.
2272 2018-04-02 19:14:32 The state actually gains tax money from this because the oil company can't afford to charge the full tax amount they pay to the consumer or they wouldnt be able to sell enough oil. The purpose of excise tax is to force corporations to internalize external costs.
2273 2018-04-02 19:14:09 @love_prezzo hello, have you stopped putting the roquito pearls on the seabass? Wasn't as good without them!! Chilli oil helped though. Would advise you to bring it back :)
2274 2018-04-02 19:14:06 well fuck
2275 2018-04-02 19:14:06 That’s what I fear haha waking up with more oil then usual in the morning. I use kbeauty steps and products and include serum in my routine and moisturizer at the end for sure so I’m like what more will they do for me. Thanks for the insight! 
2276 2018-04-02 19:14:03 You know that foreign oil is not subject to the same environmental regulations as well as the new guidelines for up and downstream emissions imposed by the NEB for CDN oil projects? How could we compete, it’s not a level playing field.
2277 2018-04-02 19:14:03 Been putting black castor oil on my eyebrow lol anything that will help them grow
2278 2018-04-02 19:13:59 My sister is currently mixing hot sauce and vegetable oil together and I am extremely confused.
2279 2018-04-02 19:13:57 yay!!! I am one of the drops of oil causing that zit lol
2280 2018-04-02 19:13:52 @republic I suggest in 2019 we need a #FederalFront so that no Single party can fleece its own people in the name of taxes; the Govt is sheer sleeping @dpradhanbjp @BJP4India on Oil Prices; 35-40% taxes; just misuse of being elected !! Very annoying
2281 2018-04-02 19:13:48 This Deserves a #Retweet in the Age of Coal  @scottwesterfield Plot idea: 97% of the world's scientists contrive an environmental crisis, but are exposed by a plucky band of billionaires & oil companies.
2282 2018-04-02 19:13:26 I wonder how much baby oil they go through
2283 2018-04-02 19:13:07 Burn marshmallow to cleanse an area. Steep the leaves and flowers in oil and use the oil to anoint yourself when you feel the need to be protected from demons or spells cast against you.
2284 2018-04-02 19:13:01 Great outlook! But, I was in oil business over 40 yrs & nobody ever refused to take my money.
2285 2018-04-02 19:12:44 Is this why Trump "hires the best" taking private planes and cushy hotels on tax payer dime ?? But wait werent these swamp monsters really rich ?? Oh, boy what a CON by the biggest snake oil salesman around.
2286 2018-04-02 19:12:40 DUDE - You got MORE money? WTAF
2287 2018-04-02 19:12:34 Ah, she's keeping it from grease and oil stains is all. Can't blame her.
2288 2018-04-02 19:12:31 LRT yes there is an oil derrick in the front yard of the Oklahoma capital building
2289 2018-04-02 19:12:31 Give me the highlights. Why was there truffle oil?
2290 2018-04-02 19:12:18 Yes, but that is mostly hydro. Paraguay and Albania have also achieved that feat. However, that is only their electricity. In Costa Rica, as in every other country,  almost all transport is oil powered.
2291 2018-04-02 19:12:16 Again, are your oil buddies given you crap? Crying? Its not fair boohoo #IQ45
2292 2018-04-02 19:12:12 We've destroyed entire countries & killed millions for the sake of oil & money. We hired terrorist headchoppers to rape & butcher their way through Syria, killing 1000s of innocent people. We need a LOT of improvement, & hiding behind American exceptionalism won't get us there.
2293 2018-04-02 19:12:08 let the #Left keep going. They are showing their true colors and pushing everyone over to the sane side. It’s fun to watch them unravel.
2294 2018-04-02 19:12:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2295 2018-04-02 19:11:18 2/ This mind-set is now having difficulties squaring with yet another oil glut. All of a sudden, Alberta isn't awash with oil money and big projects and Jason Kenney is campaigning on some kind of fantasy return to Leduc and Ozzie and Harriet.
2296 2018-04-02 19:11:10 because they are funded by the rich who also own oil companies.
2297 2018-04-02 19:11:03 this shit look like a Renaissance Oil painting
2298 2018-04-02 19:11:00 New Zealand-based Logan Distribution now has the rights to distribute Lucas Oil products in Australia and New Zealand.  @Lucas_Oil
2299 2018-04-02 19:10:51 Once the oil barons and human rights deniers pull ot you'll be playing Stockport again
2300 2018-04-02 19:10:40 the dumbest stuff happens to me. the last vitamin E oil i purchased busted in my bag. so that pissed me off and i haven’t purchased more ever since.
2301 2018-04-02 19:10:31 Big oil and you left the Trump/WSJ commission on making him look good.
2302 2018-04-02 19:10:23 Oil
2303 2018-04-02 19:10:16 Maybe Okies should also stop voting for the republicans whose backward economic policies handed out money to oil companies while defunding/underfunding education. Hmm?
2304 2018-04-02 19:10:08 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
2305 2018-04-02 19:09:57 With this oil sell-off the Russian market will get crushed tmrw.
2306 2018-04-02 19:09:53 Big oil lobbyism, that's what it is
2307 2018-04-02 19:09:47 Your ideas have far reaching impact I'm sure.

2308 2018-04-02 19:09:43 *kisses you back gently* Ok... *I walk into the bathroom and start the bath. Adding some lavender bubble oil that was there before coming into the bedroom and stripping out of my clothes*
2309 2018-04-02 19:09:41 It’s like heeey Monday! Be good to me! —checks oil on car— wind slams hood on my hand 5 minutes in... gotcha! That’s how we wanna play huh? All good, not gonna ruin my day
2310 2018-04-02 19:09:24 People should have the common sense to understand that snake oil peddlers like Marius et al are full of shit, OR learn the hard way IMO.
2311 2018-04-02 19:09:22 It's been my view from Alberta that AB's oil wealth seemed to fuel an attitude that political power should be about money and not people. It didn't matter how many people were in central Canada, Alberta's oil money should buy power. /2
2312 2018-04-02 19:09:15 In Unprecedented Move, China Plans To Pay For Oil Imports With Yuan Instead Of Dollars #preppers #prepping #survival
2313 2018-04-02 19:09:07 I solve most health and life concerns with various coconut products: coconut water, coconut oil, trips to places with coconuts, coconut milk, etc. 
2314 2018-04-02 19:08:48 Oklahoma teachers are the lowest paid in the country!! Oil rich Oklahoma... trailer and mobile home court captial of world shows how financially corrupt is this state!!!! I once drove through Tulsa for miles of trailers courts lol... they need to wise up and OUST POLITICIANS!!!
2315 2018-04-02 19:08:45 big oil, that's why
2316 2018-04-02 19:08:40 Wrong - he is in cahoots with the “Jewish people” if you consider the Jewish State is wholly owned and controlled by the House of Rothschild. The House of Saud owe their position, wealth and allegiance to the House of Rothschild, and the Rothschilds want the Iranian oil.
2317 2018-04-02 19:08:39 in replace for egg and oil/fat source
2318 2018-04-02 19:08:38 Leeches are corporate welfare oil companies and Albertans who want to decimate BC and Canada’s coast for the enrichment of Texans.
2319 2018-04-02 19:08:31 Harold Hamm is rich enough.  No more raping OK on oil and gas.  It’s time!  To collect what’s due to OK and the kids.
2320 2018-04-02 19:08:29 CBD oil!!!!!!! every day i am thankful that i found this miracle for my anxiety and stomach issues. life was so much more stressful before I started using it :)
2321 2018-04-02 19:08:25 Oil lobby hates EV thats only thing I can come up with....
2322 2018-04-02 19:08:16 I believe 100% that cannabis was part of the holy anointment oil. It's heals the blind (glucoma) it's heals leprasy. Casts out demons (those who had siezures and epelepsy). Messiah means the annointed one. Christ means to annointed.
2323 2018-04-02 19:08:13 Tasted it once in my life. E bitter pass kernel oil.
2324 2018-04-02 19:08:08 Reason number 1 would be greedy oil companies, and reason number 2 would be because no other car company would generate the same amount of clicks.
2325 2018-04-02 19:08:06 does this include almond oil??
2326 2018-04-02 19:08:03 ROBOTSCUMOIL
2327 2018-04-02 19:07:59 It’s called a monopoly! Standard oil didn’t win and neither should Amazon. Amazon use’s the Post Office to its benefit, never understood why PO was delivering packages on a Sunday time to make them pay
2328 2018-04-02 19:07:51 hang in there bud, hope the oil works!
2329 2018-04-02 19:07:28 That's exactly right. Russia's interest in Syria has to do with keeping control of Syrian oil. They had a contract with Assads dad so it's in their interest to keep him in power. They couldnt care less about stopping ISIS.
2330 2018-04-02 19:07:18 Because big oil probably own shares in the paper.
2331 2018-04-02 19:07:15 things you can never own enough of, in my expert opinion: underwear, candles, olive oil, table coasters, toilet paper, lip balm
2332 2018-04-02 19:07:02 Motor oil does not wear out—it just gets dirty—so recycling it saves a valuable resource
2333 2018-04-02 19:06:58 Alienating millions of potential customers probably doesnt help. #IngrahamAngle
2334 2018-04-02 19:06:45 i use a cotton swab to dab tea tree oil on any new pimples/marks. pixi glow tonic is also really helpful & helped me fall in love with my skin. a good vitamin C cleanser or rosehip oil would help as well! (i use a vitamin c cleanser that has aloe & rosehip)
2335 2018-04-02 19:06:35 Do you take the pill or the oil form
2336 2018-04-02 19:06:26 > 10% chance to spew a cloud of hot oil when attacked for the next hour
2337 2018-04-02 19:06:17 It becomes political when our Gov cut school funding , so they can cut taxes on the Oil industries . Which the heavy cuts came in about 2-3 years ago
2338 2018-04-02 19:06:16 i use argan oil and warm water:)
2339 2018-04-02 19:06:12 Aquel video de Midnight Oil (Beds are burnin') podría ser de un paisaje de Oklahoma, o Mato Grosso do Sul, o la mezcla de ambos.

2341 2018-04-02 19:06:08 3/29/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = -2 to 993, Oil -7 to 797, Gas +4 to 194, DIR = 60, HZ = 870, Vert = 63 (#RT)
2342 2018-04-02 19:06:07 That’s just fine with me. Time to redirect Canada’s enormous subsidies from oil and gas to renewables. Oil and gas belong to Canadians, not corporations.
2343 2018-04-02 19:06:05 Actually we neither have capacity nor the will to excavate and utilize e.g Rekodeq, karak oil and gas reserves with several mining potentials in FATA to name few
2344 2018-04-02 19:06:01 What of civil engineering
2345 2018-04-02 19:05:55 It was an almost, thankfully! But then when I grabbed the olive oil I opened a cabinet first (it’s kept on the counter), then forgot to put the lid back on it when I put it away. #magicalmondaymorning
2346 2018-04-02 19:05:54 i guess it would depend on the type of oil you’re talking about, but even oily skin can see benefits from face oils/serums. the reason your skin is oily is because it thinks it isn’t producing enough oil. if you give it oil eventually it’ll cut back on its own
2347 2018-04-02 19:05:46 Justice to me last night *leans in super serious* yo... key... your face is real oily
Me: yeah cause I just put oil on it 
 the concern was so genuine and real lmao
2348 2018-04-02 19:05:44 hmmm oil and gas sediments....wonder where those came from.......;P
2349 2018-04-02 19:05:43 Today your UAE is protected its only because of Pakistan remember that. Idiot before selling oil your ancestors were miser and begger idiots @sabena_siddiqi
2350 2018-04-02 19:05:42 They better be rubbing up with coconut oil to stay loose
2351 2018-04-02 19:05:33 This Honda dealership is playing the Cash version of Hurt, which I'm fine with but it seems a little heavy for getting my oil changed.
2352 2018-04-02 19:05:30 We don't put oil on birds or sea life in order to film for advertising. We use already-captured footage of oiled wildlife that our partners International Bird Rescue & The Marine Mammal Center capture when saving an animal from an oil spill.
2353 2018-04-02 19:05:27 The smell of peppermint oil is so comforting, it reminds me of my dad

US equities tanking at present (to the tune of -3%) as the double-whammy of tech and China concerns continue to weigh on sentiment - Monday not a holiday in the US; declining oil adding to equity woes; NZD charged toward 0.7250, but was unable to maintain altitude.

2380 2018-04-02 19:02:43 I don't think that's the argument. Polling data shows that CDN oil/gas has lost political legitimacy over past 10-15 yrs. Industry needs to regain that legitimacy by engaging public and selling many advances it has made re. environment, GHG emissions. Engagement, not PR, is key.

2399 2018-04-02 19:00:53 It doesn’t make stretch marks or scars go away like magic, but for your face, if you use warm water/steam to open your pores and apply as a sleeping oil, I find it helps. It’s best to use at night because won’t work as well if you tone, which you should be doing for daytime.

2415 2018-04-02 18:59:39 We do not use Neem oil on the plants. Ever. Neem is an anti-feedant and after drying the neem oil becomes more of a repellant to the insect. That is why we only treat with soaps and mineral oils. That is our policy.

2484 2018-04-02 18:50:50 Your position here is nonsensical, because it suggests that oil companies are operating on a razor thin profit margin in PA currently.

They are not. 

Beyond that is the fact that in many cases the wells are already there, and taxing the production isn't going to force them out.

2493 2018-04-02 18:49:50 I always go to the Home Depot - or get my oil changed - when I want to feel like I don’t know anything #Sarcasm
2494 2018-04-02 18:49:50 It's yet a challenge for Brazil to attract more local firms, but in Mexico they have a good number of newborn Mexican oil firms and other Latin American companies participating in auctions

2496 2018-04-02 18:49:39 In a society where people are free to make decisions for themselves you'll never achieve parity. It's not desirable to force individuals to insure all positions are "equally" filled. 

Doubting there will ever be a real push for "equality" in plumbing/sewer/coal/oil etc. fields.
2497 2018-04-02 18:49:34 I know we don’t but your argument is that importing oil is cheaper than using our own, so my point is that if you use that logic why not import everything that we could get elsewhere cheaper? To hell with CDN jobs and business, it’s all about getting things cheaper, right?
2498 2018-04-02 18:49:32 Telling ppl where police WON'T BE is a good idea?
2499 2018-04-02 18:49:31 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you’re killing us with this trade war business. Steps to calm the markets would be nice. Oil is down $2 bucks.
2500 2018-04-02 18:49:29 Did you lather it in olive oil?
2501 2018-04-02 18:49:12 Also cookies in the shape of oil rigs seemed ... not so appetizing

and after that I grab my fork and wisk till it's not forkable anymore
2507 2018-04-02 18:48:48 Pruitt did this kinda crap when he worked in Oklahoma ! He protected nobody,no thing ! Just big oil and big business ! He’s as crooked as our OK Gov Mary Fallin ! She and the OK GOP have torn state apart !! Cole and Langford and Inhoffe are No better !!

2509 2018-04-02 18:48:42 You assume I support Obama's war campaign. American intervention in the middle East for oil has been nothing short of disastrous

2511 2018-04-02 18:48:41 Teachers are at the OK capitol, where if you've never seen it, there's a giant oil derrick to remind you who owns the state. Energy companies pay no taxes, and teachers starve.
2512 2018-04-02 18:48:33 Most of our genetic code evolved @ a period when we ate 20tsp of sugar/year, as well as over 40g of Omega-3(fish oil)/day.

Today, we can easily eat that dose of sugar in 1 day (avg consumption of 158lbs sugar/yr) & the avg American takes 60+ days to get that dose of Omega-3s.

2516 2018-04-02 18:48:00 All the top 20 are either oil rich or low-population with high financial services dependencies.

The only exception I can find is Iceland, and they have massive geothermal energy supply, a tiny population and do over 70% of their trade with EU countries.

Try harder.

2522 2018-04-02 18:46:24 politics, involved in oil block scandals, introduced monumental bribing of legislators & engineered the third term agenda.
2523 2018-04-02 18:46:13 Here is a thought:  Maybe if Brit police dialed back on investigating hurtful words and spent more resources working on the part of protecting people from physical harm?
2524 2018-04-02 18:46:12 Moisturize those lips! Lips dry out faster as they have fewer oil glands. Apply lip balm with sunscreen. Keep them moist and sun protected.

2532 2018-04-02 18:45:26 You combust LOTS of oil indirectly. Just like any of us. Again, go to your fridge and also make an inventory of everything you have that was not made in the UK. 
Also, you never travel by plane?
2533 2018-04-02 18:45:25 I’ve always had horrible skin issues and for the last 6 months I’ve been using the Clinique Clarifying Lotion (liquid exfoliator) and then using the Sunday Riley UFO oil and I’ve seen a DRAMATIC improvement.

2540 2018-04-02 18:44:40 I mix this oil myself. Tea tree oil kills bacteria and protects new skin and open pours while almond or coco ut oil mixed with it moisturizes and protects as well. I avoid red bumps entirely this way and then I apply my nornal lotions once skin is dry and no longer oily.
2541 2018-04-02 18:44:37 oil paints r so satisfying... my eyes have been opened

2548 2018-04-02 18:43:33 That I smoothe over with my hands. And then gently washing that off. 

The key here is: be gentle. Whether you use nair or magic powder. Depilators eat hair and top layer of skin. 

After any shaving or exfoliating, I always quickly apply a mix of tea tree oil and almond oil.

2561 2018-04-02 18:41:58 Hey Katie, thanks for reaching out! No plans to bring them back at this time, but we’d suggest trying our Almond Oil Fiery Thai – it has hints of lemongrass and ginger that might suit your fancy.
2562 2018-04-02 18:41:56 Letting them in only encourages more to come.
They get In, have children or just disappear and we never get rid of them. Beyond absurd

2568 2018-04-02 18:41:20 I honestly don't blame the Palestinians as much as other people I also dont blame the Isralies. I think that the other oil rich Muslim nations would help the Palestinians live better but then there would be no reason for them to bitch at the Isralies.
2569 2018-04-02 18:41:12 Running for President they tell you that Nigeria is oil rich and our problem is corruption. So they boast about gradiose socialist spending plans with no idea how to fund them. But Nigeria is oil poor per capita!

2580 2018-04-02 18:39:56 Finally got an oil change today and the guy actually lectured me about how low it was. Listen Greg, I already know. That’s why I’m here.
2581 2018-04-02 18:39:44 At this rate we should hit 50 in 30-60 days
2582 2018-04-02 18:39:42 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts sesame oil with 1 part balsamic vinegar and 1 part mustard. Add thyme and brown sugar to taste.

2584 2018-04-02 18:39:13 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

2588 2018-04-02 18:38:50 Regular oil changes are one of the best things you can do for your engines longevity. Come on in and get 20% off your spring time oil change through April 15th.

2592 2018-04-02 18:38:14 It has to bounce but it feels very broken to me. No volume up days, lots on down days. Broken levels. Led up by tech - FANG in trouble technically and equity risk premium rises on trade wars. Also think price action oil very bearish so net net yours!
2593 2018-04-02 18:38:12 Don't run from GOOD fats! Raw almonds, olive oil and avocado... Its necessary to help absorb the nutrients from other foods you eat!!!

2595 2018-04-02 18:37:48 Not using your car for a day would achieve significantly more than not pumping gas as this actually affects your overall consumption. And then again, 1 of 365 days without consuming gas is hardly significant. #gas #oil #april15
2596 2018-04-02 18:37:47 #Thorium:  With Thorium, oil is preserved for the value it brings to the globe without burning it for energy production, in the form of clothing, plastics, medicine, fertilizer, and endless chemical uses, including lubricants. Why are we burning such a precious resource?

2600 2018-04-02 18:37:29 The only point at which it becomes an issue is if you actually tax them so much that it is no longer profitable to pull the gas from the ground.

You can easily impose a severance tax and have the gas extraction still turn a tidy profit for the oil companies.
2601 2018-04-02 18:37:14 lol my car was 2000 miles past an oil change 
2602 2018-04-02 18:37:10 Some days I wish I could grab my managers by their hair and push them into the oil vats. #mcdonaldsproblems
2603 2018-04-02 18:37:07 There is no logic in "boycotting" big oil by not pumping gas for a day if your overall gas consumption doesn't decrease. #oil #april15 #gas

2605 2018-04-02 18:37:02 I love when kids sell their builds after something bad happens to them like a cracked oil pan on an e36 and then you sell the entire car for the price of every penny you put into it like you’ve never heard of the term “depreciation” daddy’s money won’t go that far kid.
2606 2018-04-02 18:36:55 While bringing in Saudi oil.. a country which supports Shariah Law still for now.

2607 2018-04-02 18:36:44 Are you advocating that eastern refineries should be made to spend billions to add coking capacity to enable their use of heaviest WC crude? Who is going to pay for that? Btw we don't buy oil from China.

2627 2018-04-02 18:35:12 It’s like trespassing or someone making off with your oil or gas. You’re not going to sue to enforce that? Even if you might have a questionable claim. IP is property.
2628 2018-04-02 18:35:11 It's obvious, Trump & Barr have no culture,  grace or sense of decorum. They represent the lowest of our culture. He's a snake oil salesman & she obviously has no grace, culture or manners of which she is proud. They both represent the lowest in culture & standards.
2629 2018-04-02 18:35:03 It’ll help heal as well, instead of simply removing the top layers of your skin like most treatments. Vitamin C, lemon, tea tree oil, etc is good but alone will ultimately be weaking the barrier of your skin.
2630 2018-04-02 18:34:48 I do not combust any petroleum products directly. Plastic isn’t produced by combusting oil products.

2632 2018-04-02 18:34:40 #Hotseat oil #money is round the corner. The big question is; Are #CrimePreventers ,a body provided for by the constitution of #Uganda or not?. How about their metamorphosing into #UPDF Reserve Force ? How comes #crime has been on the rise, irrespective of such 12M strong force?

2634 2018-04-02 18:34:22 Oil is good, but before oil and all that. Cattle is everything. And farming but that's woman stuff for the soft ass aggies.
2635 2018-04-02 18:34:21 @RyanZinke Guess what! You are an idiot! Native Americans have the right to keep your money grubbing minions off their property to prevent drilling for oil. You are an #idiot
2636 2018-04-02 18:34:20 I need like every essential oil that they make. #help #addicted
2637 2018-04-02 18:33:59 Hmm, the oil rig part of Diamonds. Would have been a good mashup with North Sea Hijack.
2638 2018-04-02 18:33:46 i use it as well and my skin is clear and oil free
2639 2018-04-02 18:33:46 It's about reducing the carbon-intensity of the crude oil. The lower the carbon-intensity, the fewer the emissions during combustion.
2640 2018-04-02 18:33:24 I have really dry skin in the winter too, to the point where it literally flakes off my forehead lmao i started using St Ives Coconut oil scrub once a week and i switched my moisturizer to an all natural clear Aloe gel, it doesn’t make your skin greasy at all it’s amazing !
2641 2018-04-02 18:33:08 Do not take it out(unless you want it to close up) Apply tea tree oil twice a day until it’s gone. I’ve had those on my tragus and nose piercing.
2642 2018-04-02 18:33:05 @weratoolsuk on oil  my oil tool box is the hand me down tools from the gas box it’s where my tools go to finally 
2643 2018-04-02 18:32:59 had to show the mechanic just how to open my car door.. so i’ve got a lot of confidence in their ability to change my oil 
2644 2018-04-02 18:32:57 I hate the smell of creme of nature argan oil products. I bought their edge control and I’m taking it right back. Don’t care that’s it’s $5. This smell is God awful.
2645 2018-04-02 18:32:54 Dry fry 1 tbsp coriander seed, 1 tbsp cumin seed, 12 black peppercorns, 4 dried chillies, 5 cardamom pods. Blitz to a paste with a little water. Add 5 tbsp olive oil and juice of one lemon. Coat lamb. Cook on 150c for 4 hours. Rest. Very easy.
2646 2018-04-02 18:32:50 Bio oil at night and chemical exfoliation 2-3 times a week. The vitamin E will help skin cell turnover.

2662 2018-04-02 18:31:05 Who funded oil subsidy during UPA regime...
2663 2018-04-02 18:31:04 Yup.  I tutor 2x a week to make an extra $150/week for groceries.  I write online articles for $100 a pop to pay for heating oil.  I’ll even buy yard sale furniture to paint & resell.  I never have enough to make ends meet.  11 yrs = $37,000.  Sad.
2664 2018-04-02 18:30:59 Monday’s aren’t so bad when you’re done with work before 12. Now I have to get my oil changed, go to Costco, get office supplies, and finally do my taxes. #productivemonday
2665 2018-04-02 18:30:58 Wrong! The increase in the costs of any steel pipeline will increase gas/oil prices and utility prices.

2674 2018-04-02 18:29:38 I don’t think we’re on the same page habibi rayan. Saudi Arabia is an energy superpower. That’s a fact. The opinion is that we should continue to lead through the focus on energy the formless, rather than in the form of oil or sun per se.

2676 2018-04-02 18:29:25 Oilers wont miss them. They killed the oil over the years
2677 2018-04-02 18:29:21 My extended family is from Mexico. We all know about the oil, but there are also vast mineral resources plus great climate for growing. Much of northen Mexico is high desert and requires irrigation, but they produce much of fruit and vegetables coming into U.S.
2678 2018-04-02 18:28:57 My favourite is hot and spicy chicken, red onion, jalapeños, chilli cheese and chilli oil to finish from Asda. Just awesome!
2679 2018-04-02 18:28:45 I'm in if I'm home! Don't think there has ever been a streamed oil change before!

2687 2018-04-02 18:27:26 Absolutely agree that the U.S. isn't taking the humanitarian crisis as seriously as it should (especially in context of oil sanctions). But the $2.5m figure is just aid to Colombia. U.S. is weighing $9m for region-wide aid to UNHCR (20% of UNHCR's estimated cost of VZ crisis)
2688 2018-04-02 18:27:10 bi oil! und dry brushing... und nach ein paar monaten verblassen sie so sehr dass man sie nur noch ein bisschen sehen kann <3

2690 2018-04-02 18:27:00 Bought biscuits are just about the most unhealthy product on earth. See also sand eel oil and damage to puffins, palm oil and damage to orangutans. etc. Not the ones I gave Sean though.
2691 2018-04-02 18:26:59 Your car runs so much better after getting an oil change
2692 2018-04-02 18:26:57 Probably. Tribes get several tax breaks through various compacts with the state. One of the increases that has happened twice in the last couple of years is car tags.  Hard to take that break and then grip about wind, oil, and others taxes.  Point is everyone pay or no one pay.
2693 2018-04-02 18:26:50 rip to another oil pan!!!!
2694 2018-04-02 18:26:48 massive assumption I know. but im going of the angles sloping down from the sides. love lucas oil. would be made up with sometjing resembling that
2695 2018-04-02 18:26:45 Yes the oil company pays the tax and then they charge it to whoever they sell it to. Then the school gets reimbursed later. You might want to call the oklahoma tax commission for more information.

2699 2018-04-02 18:25:58 More than 2% isn't "no measurable impact".
But you know that, you just don't care to reduce oil use.
2700 2018-04-02 18:25:54 Have just looked up East Texas, it is nothing like I imagined! I thought desert with oil rigs (too much Dalas as a child) it looks like somewhere I would love to visit.

2703 2018-04-02 18:25:42 Never forget the oil.
2704 2018-04-02 18:25:29 The USA should convert some of their consumption from oil to gas, and export the oil saved.
2705 2018-04-02 18:25:21 Baby oil jenama Johnson ke
2706 2018-04-02 18:25:20 Of course there is leakage into the Athabasca River. That's because the oil is literally RIGHT THERE in the river banks. I won't pretend that everything is perfect. Nothing is. However, to paraphrase your words, the mess isn't as bad as your lot claims either
2707 2018-04-02 18:25:18 Holy Oil was like 25% marijuana, too. When the priest went in annually to receive a message from God, he basically stood in a smoked out room until he got said message.
2708 2018-04-02 18:25:10 Runs in all of our minds Sweetheart, it does. Nothing speaks of seriousness than an all out parade, most legal countries did it to oil the rust.

2733 2018-04-02 18:20:25 You think a carbon tax will squeeze more than oil companies fighting for their lives?
They impose 9% hikes in price, overnight, yet consumers live with that apparently.
2734 2018-04-02 18:20:20 A clever article that leaves it to its readers to determine that illegal immigration is necessary if we want to keep on BORROWING ! No we don't want to keep on BORROWING and no we don't want to increase our tax base through illegal immigration. PS we import half our oil.
2735 2018-04-02 18:20:00 @ABDanielleSmith and on the subject of Ontario Bill 21 claiming the oil and coal companies are liable - the obvious point is they have millions of co-conspirators called consumers

2740 2018-04-02 18:19:24 Me too!!! Also the oil machines ????
2741 2018-04-02 18:19:21 My husband says that bc the economy is doing well and new construction is up, the demand for oil & gas is also up. Makes sense to me.
2742 2018-04-02 18:19:18 It’s a one day boycott to try and fight price gouging because gas prices been real crazy lately and if enough people don’t buy gas for one day it will affect oil companies in the middle east so much that prices will go down overnight

2747 2018-04-02 18:18:43 I had responded to a tweet earlier about who #MUFC fans would rather go out of CL, #MCFC or #LFC, I made the point that #MUFC should have more respect for #LFC given they are established on history and passion, not oil. Boy did I get it in the neck.

2757 2018-04-02 18:16:53 It's actually not great for everyone's hair; makes it feel dry. I'd say it works better as a pre-shampoo conditioner. As for skin, it works when used as an oil cleanser, but imo, leaving it on is asking for a breakout

-Crude oil down almost 3%.
-Uncertainty about US trade policy remains.

2770 2018-04-02 18:15:15 With no hurricanes, war, refinery disasters, oil rig fires, gas prices remain at all time highs but we can't find any excuse why.

2772 2018-04-02 18:15:10 Oklahoma legislature spends more money sending people to prison and giving tax cuts to oil companies than education. Their priorities are just messed-up! #oklahomateacherwalkout
2773 2018-04-02 18:15:04 If every exporter in Russia’s class would build storage the way their data implies it, there would be swimming pools in Houston and Dhahran packed with oil.
2774 2018-04-02 18:15:02 Oil changes are dangerous....
2775 2018-04-02 18:14:59 I'm sure the other 5% of the oil was galling for Rockefeller as well.
2776 2018-04-02 18:14:56 I saw an anti-vax thread on here recently and realised it had been started by a woman who, on Facebook, told me that my dad could easily be cured of Parkinson’s if he just ate a different diet and took coconut oil supplements.
2777 2018-04-02 18:14:49 @WolfBearPig69 @Heatemup because of the longer term trend line but if indices continue correction, and they seem to, oil will not go up
2778 2018-04-02 18:14:41 While the picture you have shared does indeed show the oilsands, what it does not show is the reclamation that is done after the oil has been removed. That reclamation is the real legacy of the oilsands.
2779 2018-04-02 18:14:34 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018...

2780 2018-04-02 18:14:11 Are we still in a downward fractal cycle with oil? Hope it bounces back up to reenter a short. Today many U.S. and European traders were still in holiday if I'm not mistaken? So maybe we'll see them buy tomorrow before we sweep the rug under them. Stocks could retest 2018 lows.
2781 2018-04-02 18:14:05 Pressure our PM to force the pipeline through, he has the power. Pipelines are the cheapest, fastest & safest way of transporting oil.

Я сегодня на больничном, но меня должны были заменить.

На что она отвечает, что те отказались заниматься с другим преподавателем и ждут только меня.
Хоть где-то я незаменима.

2787 2018-04-02 18:13:27 Nice little salad for lunch today. And by little, I mean: 200g of broiled/crispy bacon slices, 3 hard boiled eggs, 100g of real Italian Parmigiano, 150g of black olives and yeah, actual leafy greens and cucumber slices. Olive oil, lemon juice, salt+pepper. 10g of carbs. #lchf
2788 2018-04-02 18:13:25 So I get beautiful rashes from bounce sheets, and the problem is more from the hair stylist I went to choosing to double wash my hair due to its natural oil levels. So I just need to let my oils repopulate and I'm over it already 
2789 2018-04-02 18:13:18 And if you knew anything about Iranian history you would know that Iran’s struggles with the Russian Empire were territorial, while the bulk of the imperialism it faced and faces came from Britain and the US, who were keen to exploit its oil resources.
2790 2018-04-02 18:13:18 It’s clear that Saudi Arabia wasn’t going to fund this forever...besides, the price of oil is way down and SA has had to make some cutbacks.
2791 2018-04-02 18:13:18 I'm not saying this is what you are doing, but weed will never be deatigmatized as long as supporters keep acting like pot is some kind of cure-all or snake oil. It has legitimate medical benefits that need exploring, but it is not all powerful and innocuous.

2793 2018-04-02 18:13:08 I do listen to all sides it's just i feel like most of it is distraction, the main resource is oil, so for me just following speaks volumes of truth, cause statistically whoever has the most revenue that does 'arms' or 'natural resources' are gonna be the ones funding warfare.
2794 2018-04-02 18:13:05 I get a lot of questions and compliments on my teeth, specifically how I keep them so white. 

I oil pull with coconut oil. 

Also, I use organic toothpaste. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY, I polish my teeth. I see too many people brush their teeth for 30 seconds, brush their tongue and go..

2814 2018-04-02 18:11:04 #Fracking is "injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks, boreholes, etc., so as to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas."  

If you tried to design a technology that triggers earthquakes and pollutes groundwater it would be difficult to improve on.

2820 2018-04-02 18:10:38 PP/PK rests entirely on the coaching staff, and should be reason for their dismissal. Give Chia one more chance to tweak the roster and hire a top-notch coach. If Oil still fail to improve in 18-19, out with Chia.

2836 2018-04-02 18:09:06 Well, as things stand, the data they present implies a storage build of half a BILLION barrels since 2013, but they only have around 20M storage capacity. In March they “added” 9M oil to it.  

They’re consistently overstating production. It’s TOO easy to manipulate that data.
2837 2018-04-02 18:09:03 i like that jin thought about how much money he could make if he sold his oil blotting papers soaked with his face oil
2838 2018-04-02 18:08:59 If Talbot's sv pct was average (.916) instead of awful (0.906), Oil would have allowed 20 fewer GA, and would be in playoff hunt. If PP/PK was just mediocre instead of horrendous, Oil would in playoffs. Oil are not far off.
2839 2018-04-02 18:08:57 Oh I just throw them right next to the egg onto the pan. You have to cut them thin and better smaller but not in cubes. They will get small later anyway and you don't even have to mix them very much. Or you can let them be alone on oil for 3 mins and add the egg above
2840 2018-04-02 18:08:56 Do you know countries that depends on oil as main economic driver suffers same fate e.g Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar .dats reason Buhari guvment policies r geared toward diversifying d economy which is on point...same happen to mexico 1984 and it diversified its economy

2884 2018-04-02 18:02:45 Presumably the oil sands are currently a money-making venture, otherwise no one would be working there; the bitumen is selling & moving. We shouldn’t, by way of national policy and investment, be encouraging an extended reliance on that flow.

2902 2018-04-02 18:00:33 How does adding taxes to alternative energies but giving tax breaks to Big Oil “a level playing ground”? You puppet!
2903 2018-04-02 18:00:20 I don't know about that i have many friends who where now in Bangalore and they didn't support BJP. Pls note the fact that in 2014 we are hardly managed to pay the fuel price. So we have to face it Now and ever. if the current scenario goes crude oil rate increasing then.?
2904 2018-04-02 18:00:19 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2905 2018-04-02 18:00:19 @25rohit18 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014? Is maximum revenue going to Nagpur and New Headquarters building?
2906 2018-04-02 18:00:15 I’d say, in my non-expert but born and bred Okie opinion, that most of Oklahoma seems fed up by how poorly the local R government has been and how much it has just given to the Oil Gods
2907 2018-04-02 18:00:02 Just because olive oil is part of the Mediterranean diet doesn't mean you have to get it from there!

2912 2018-04-02 17:59:06 whoops, i was supposed to get my oil changed 3,000 miles ago..
2913 2018-04-02 17:59:02 Can't see how #oil co's will entice investors to entertain the idea of capex for new fields if prices show no stability ! At one point there will be the mother of all imbalances as shale does not replace conventional fields & has high depletion rates. #Brent #OOTT #WTI
2914 2018-04-02 17:58:55 He is from Oklahoma where the republicans in the House and Senate are refusing to properly fund education while giving big oil & gas companies tax breaks. I know you don't expect anything other than a corrupt idiot when referring to Pruitt. #VoteBlue #VoteThemOut

thanks, aunts
2923 2018-04-02 17:57:39 And how is Biden's son doing in Ukraine supervising oil shipments to/from Russia?  Appearance of impropriety?  Fruit of a colored revolution?  Fake concern for rule of law as witness to illegal intervention by Dems in '16 election?  Over-the-hill bully?  Wait!  There's more!
2924 2018-04-02 17:57:35 Everyone. Germany is considering leaving 100 years of 20% of electricity supply at 3 cents/kWh in the ground for sake of climate? Any others that are comparable? UK & NL ran out of gas, Canada poised to extract oil, etc. I don't see another country planning "leave in the ground"

2928 2018-04-02 17:57:04 Good afternoon Adam. Thanks for your great work. I'm fortunate enough to be short oil via DWT. With oil now at $63, does this increase your confidence that we are heading to $61 & possibly to $50's?
2929 2018-04-02 17:57:04 If a country doesn’t give the USA their oil in 15 minutes we’re legally allowed to invade.

2935 2018-04-02 17:56:16 It can but it adds shine and I just use a moisturizer of oil to add more shine and moisture
2936 2018-04-02 17:56:12 Wings are for birds matei'm way past wings when both do deals with terrorist states like SA, which in case people don't know flew 15 people into the twin towers to invade iraq and take the oil, 2002: Exxon mobil richest oil company 2018: Saudi Aramco - 2+2=4 it's actually simple.
2937 2018-04-02 17:55:59 Well, good news is...my delayed shipment of molds came in. Bad news is, it was delayed because they didn't package the free fragrance oil samples good enough, so one of the caps was shattered and it leaked all over the box and the molds. 
2938 2018-04-02 17:55:53 Yesterday's Appetizers....Insalata Caprese....Sausage stuffed Mushrooms in White wine and olive oil, Breaded fried meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, antipasto with homemade roasted red peppers...my sister Joann made it all...fantastic.

2941 2018-04-02 17:55:04 He should have been clearer, he is talking in term of monopoly a la Standard Oil, that doesn't apply to tech companies i.e consumers aren't being hurt in the wallet by goog or facebook. There would have to be a massive change in a antitrust doctrine to go after them in the US.
2942 2018-04-02 17:55:03 If these people want to buy America, let these businessmen fly to that country to do business.
They are selling America off, bit by bit.
On the other hand, remember when American oil companies built all those oil wells in the Middle East then got tossed out. The $$ tide turned

3002 2018-04-02 17:48:17 Is this one of those "the bigger the lie" things?
1400 years?  Middle ages? Medieval England?  

So the US invasion to destabilize oil countries in the Middle East (Wolfowitz doctrine) can be conflated with religious conflicts and traced back to the fall of the Roman Empire?
3003 2018-04-02 17:48:03 Yaass please do And upload themm. Honestly once these boards finish I'll focus on sketching too. All that canvas painting has made me lose touch with oil pastels and charcoal pencils. (I'll go back to school during exhibitions though will You)
3004 2018-04-02 17:47:46 Hurt ? You mean like America has been hurt by China Free Riding! They enjoy the benefits of buying oil without paying the price of endless wars! Then they pay us back with attempts to displace the US dollar as the worlds reserve currency.   Oh and they block their markets!

3034 2018-04-02 17:44:15 Wow i just took the best shower , oil my whole body down wish I can just lay in bed all day 
3035 2018-04-02 17:44:04 @hol_ingredientdo you promote cbd hemp oil products?
3036 2018-04-02 17:43:58 Looks to me like a mix of the Dortmund Stadium and the outside of the Lucas Oil Stadium ..... even though I haven’t seen any outside pics I’ve always thought that they would go that way with the Heritage site and all that
3037 2018-04-02 17:43:58 Love the uniqueness of the Lucas Oil Stadium..
3038 2018-04-02 17:43:57 Coconut oil is a scam but I agree on the black soap
3039 2018-04-02 17:43:49 i forgot all about my oil change  maybe tomorrow
3040 2018-04-02 17:43:43 @AmazingPhil you should really oil your door it kept squeaking everytime you went inside during pigeon fest

3042 2018-04-02 17:43:27 Lol first of all the economic change led by MBS only started a couple of years ago. Second of all, there are a ton of un-opened oil fields, along with UNTOUCHED natural gas sources. So we'll pretty much be still rich when your grandkids are starving because of Erdogans messups.
3043 2018-04-02 17:43:21 Oil is based on the dollar. Returning the dollar to gold may strengthen oil as well
3044 2018-04-02 17:43:09 @brainouty Remember RBT mentioning the Protcols of Zion? They were forged & published by Sergei Nilus in 1903. Big surprise, Nilus was a Russian Orthodox Mystic. In the meter, 1903 is 1873, foolish seeking oil from wise. Nilus was trying to muster up anti-Semitism from believers.
3045 2018-04-02 17:42:35 I know those US invading for oil memes are funny but none of them can top the fact that the US is using corn to create a small amount of oil while millions starve to death every year.
3046 2018-04-02 17:42:32 Those threats sounds like castor oil with orange 
3047 2018-04-02 17:42:31 What is this new "lip oil" shit I've seen it around and been too suspicious to try it
3048 2018-04-02 17:42:27 This take sucks. Coal owns both parties in WV (Gov. Justice, the villain here, ran and won as a Democrat, then went back to GOP), and oil owns both parties in Oklahoma. Instead of blaming "red" voters, look at patterns of exploitation.
3049 2018-04-02 17:42:27 Metadata is the new oil, per these conference presenters. Can’t wait for the US army to invade my library for “freedom”
3050 2018-04-02 17:42:12 yes. i approve of this oil on canvas masterpiece
3051 2018-04-02 17:42:11 Additionally, iron oxidizes fish oil so we couldn't include both into 1 formula. We are planning on including iron into a new pill formula in the future so stay tuned!
3052 2018-04-02 17:42:08 It would mean less oil needed so no #fracking - but our @govuk is in the pocket of big companies so nothing will change until it's too fracking late and our planet is ruined
3053 2018-04-02 17:41:59 @narendramodi Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?
3054 2018-04-02 17:41:51 Lol. No ooo. Jamaica castor oil is one of the best out there especially the black one. It saved my edges
3055 2018-04-02 17:41:49 Debates can rumble on with who, where and when of past glories but nobody can deny Man City are the team to beat in the present. Numpties mentioning oil money I ask you to prove that you’re club since it’s establishment has not had a rich benefactor to create the foundations 
3056 2018-04-02 17:41:43 the lady said 20 minutes for my oil change i been in this bitch for a hour now 
3057 2018-04-02 17:41:43 It seems It's gunna have the look of the Lucas oil stadium which I'm sure is one he designed an if it was made like that stadium wud fit perfect on the docks
3058 2018-04-02 17:41:42 Can we get some funding, they said only partly, We only love our guns and our oil we're sorry. #TeacherWalkout

3063 2018-04-02 17:41:28 i’ve already tried tea tree oil and i think that’s what has made my skin so much worse :( but thank you
3064 2018-04-02 17:41:28 Having a debate: how often do you get the oil changed in your car?
3065 2018-04-02 17:41:20 @AHarmonyHealing  do you promote cbd hemp oil products?
3066 2018-04-02 17:41:20 Any oil is fine. Sesame oil just gives mild Chinese feels
3067 2018-04-02 17:41:15 Good lord, you look like a 2-bit snake oil salesman.
3068 2018-04-02 17:41:08 I think you meant oil money
3069 2018-04-02 17:40:45 Im also going to cosign Kashmir and bath & body glow on shimmer body oil is nice too
3070 2018-04-02 17:40:42 It’s important that Native Americans remain in the Dept. Of the Interior and have voices in changes involving public lands. 
No to shrinking public lands and national monuments for the sake of drilling for oil and gas. No to running pipelines across these lands.
3071 2018-04-02 17:40:41 Getting an oil change and my phone is on 4% ... awesome.
3072 2018-04-02 17:40:35 I use sweet almond oil or avocado oil or grape seed oil they’re all lightweight oils that have small particles that will be able to penetrate your skin and give it moisture
3073 2018-04-02 17:40:33 Oooohhhhh, torture with long term benefits, lol. Vegan chocolate is delicious! Not sure how accessible it is where you are, but it's easy to make at home if you're inclined. I think coconut oil is a key ingredient. 
3074 2018-04-02 17:40:26 oil on canvas who wants to paint me xx  pls
3075 2018-04-02 17:40:20 Well worded boss. His deliverance starts right here, if he gets it right, he would bow for your anointing so he gets baptised in the dam of wisdom & get some oil pored on his head. If he doesn't, he would misyarn in respobse to this and he would be shown a roadmap to wisdom land.

3082 2018-04-02 17:39:30 You should have offered services.
3083 2018-04-02 17:39:28 Nope RT.

As you said abt Kodak on that topic the day before,

NOTHING IS ABT "KŌDA KUMI" WHO HIRED "TUK ARIYA RATANAVIRAKUL" TO DEFAMED EBERYBODY IT HATES JUST BC IT SHARE THE SAME BD AS "OIL" A 100%THAI BLOODED SLUT HO LIED EVERYTHING ONLINE.

*You can google IT's name.
3084 2018-04-02 17:39:27 That’s their goal. With gas prices going up every day, that’s the same as artificially boosting demand for oil.
3085 2018-04-02 17:39:25 Coconut oil

3092 2018-04-02 17:38:42 If we are playing this game, how much does cutting the EPA (as Harper did) helps the environment?  Explain how cutting regulations on environmental protections so his oil buddies could avoid taxes helps the environment?
3093 2018-04-02 17:38:20 I love snake oil. That or more creepy stuff tbh.

3095 2018-04-02 17:38:09 Can a common man expect 10-15% reduction in Oil/Gas prices now from this income or can  farmers expect 50%+MSP for their corps. Any plan for this money on real ground ?
3096 2018-04-02 17:38:07 Consequently, we should annex the Baja Penninsula as well. Easier to defend as we would then deploy sharks with lasers.

Mexico has oil!
3097 2018-04-02 17:38:03 Coconut oil everywhere has to be the biggest one.
3098 2018-04-02 17:38:01 Monopolies are fun for everyone, bring back standard oil
3099 2018-04-02 17:38:01 Coconut oil and black soap. We need legitimate suppliers for that in Harare.

3121 2018-04-02 17:35:30 coconut oil in your hot brewed coffee is life changing
3122 2018-04-02 17:35:29 Naturally at the end of the day the only solution is the avoid just in case. It was a real eye opener for me when I heard it's a commonly used oil. I wish it weren't.
3123 2018-04-02 17:35:25 The answer is to let them figure it out.If USA wants to stop buying oil from them, that is their right. Venezuela was a democracy until 2015 and they voted for these criminals.
3124 2018-04-02 17:35:19 Battery is fine and got my oil changed

3126 2018-04-02 17:34:52 Coconut oil is so heavy and thick that it just sits on top of your skin so your skin will not absorb it no srsly put some coconut oil one side of your face and then put a light oil on the other leave it on for 8 hours and tell me that coconut oil actually absorbed ILL EAT MY HAT

3134 2018-04-02 17:34:09 Try castor oil at night, it dries up oily skin! I know it sounds weird given it’s oil but it completely dries up oily skin.

3139 2018-04-02 17:33:03 Kat Von D and Fenty Beauty foundation are both super easy to remove, and pairing them with ELF poreless primer (which is very gentle and is made with saylic acid and tea tree oil) has cleared me up a lot
3140 2018-04-02 17:33:03 More of a line marketed for men . I noticed and use an oil by a company called Cremo . I like the bourbon scented . It says it use the Argon oil and it made me think of you .You definitely need manly fragrances .
3141 2018-04-02 17:32:38 the other oil boys need more love and attention cuz I don’t know much about them and I would like to get to see more of Jujhar and Oskar specifically

3145 2018-04-02 17:32:21 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
3146 2018-04-02 17:32:18 Jamaican castor oil again? I tot castor oil was castor oil?
3147 2018-04-02 17:32:17 And we’re off and running with phase one of the monodiet.   14 straight days of plain potatoes.  No salt, butter, cheese, pepper, oil... any additives.   And no being prepared any other way than boiled or baked.  Only drinking water as well.
3148 2018-04-02 17:32:12 no, semua org memang patut guna oil cleanser sebab face cleanser just remove sweat and dirt, tapi oil cleanser utk remove oil essence kat muka, good to minimise the pores also, sunscreen jangan lupa pakai, utk elak pigmentation sebelum masanya
3149 2018-04-02 17:32:03 Oh that’s without a doubt and I will get a chance against you at some point hun and that is also without a doubt 
3150 2018-04-02 17:31:59 LOVE this game. Julien always sells awesomely. I can never get tired of Snake Oil podcasts.
3151 2018-04-02 17:31:58 Sesame oil in particular or olive oil will work too ?
3152 2018-04-02 17:31:47 The worst of snake oil preaching!

3157 2018-04-02 17:31:18 My hair is unhappy thanks to not feeding it with coconut oil. Does anyone have a reliable coconut oil supplier?
3158 2018-04-02 17:31:15 That’s because coconut oil is actually drying and the more you use it over time it’ll make your skin dryer there’s many articles online about it, i stopped using it on my skin now i use sweet almond oil and my dry patches went away with in a week
3159 2018-04-02 17:31:10 I had to put baby powder in it to absorb some of the oil 
3160 2018-04-02 17:31:10 So proud of all my teacher friends here in Oklahoma who said "enough is enough". The tax "gifts" to the oil industry have robbed our kids of a proper education for too damn long! Remember in November, fellow Okies. #oklahomateacherwalkout
3161 2018-04-02 17:30:50 This is the slowest damn oil change I’ve ever gotten
3162 2018-04-02 17:30:40 If putting warm oil in doesn’t clear yr ear then you need to get it syringed at yr medical centre
3163 2018-04-02 17:30:37 Any true hockey fan can appreciate these two gems. Even tho I bleed oil through and through they were fun to watch. #LovedtoHate

3165 2018-04-02 17:30:35 Sorry tweeted the wrong person- however we still haven’t received our@heating oil delivery ... and should came on Friday??? Nr256qr please can you check why??
3166 2018-04-02 17:30:28 When you understand how the real world works... give me a tweet. The "Coalition" troops are not in Syria or any other country because they give a rat's azz about the syrians. If Syria did not have oil deposits no one would care.
3167 2018-04-02 17:30:27 just got word from Teac that I must ad more with and keep my Brush in a cup op tirps if oil and water if water paint
3168 2018-04-02 17:30:11 Dang, blast from the past with Alkaline Trio - I remember seeing them headline a few shows way back... Time to listen to snake oil tanker

3170 2018-04-02 17:30:01 as we noted to clients last week on #OIL,

whadyya thunk was gonna happen when a sell off is triggered? 

#OOTT
3171 2018-04-02 17:29:56 It's a scary thing. From what I've read a regular restaurant will use peanut oil that's refined, it's cheap to use, high smoke point and the bad protein is removed. It would be a very unusual and probably a little more exclusive place using gormet/pure peanut. AFAIK.
3172 2018-04-02 17:29:52 Says the shirtless guy flexing in his profile pic...
3173 2018-04-02 17:29:50 Listen. I love using straws. And while I'm sad about straws getting stuck in animals, I am not going to stop using straws until boats and oil rigs stop emitting dangerous chemicals into the water. Bc that's the true killer. Not a damn straw.
3174 2018-04-02 17:29:39 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.

3177 2018-04-02 17:28:57 That wild hair growth oil smells so bad. I washed my hair today and I can still smell it. 

Gonna wash my hair AGAIN tonight.

3179 2018-04-02 17:28:48 Cost are different per state. New York might spend 13,000 per student, which makes the average 10,000 per student. They don't take the extra and give it to "oil barons". Besides education is a state issue not federal.

3184 2018-04-02 17:27:15 it’s my first time to do the oil cleansing method. i hope it works well with my problematic skin
3185 2018-04-02 17:27:14 Who is using this oil though? Are BS-6 compliant vehicles out on Delhi roads?
3186 2018-04-02 17:27:10 Sorry if you don’t want tips from people who aren’t in the same position as you (bc I def get annoyed by people who present cure-all’s for my mental health) but have you ever tried CBD oil?
3187 2018-04-02 17:27:09 Yuuuz argan oil conditioner, shampoo, and hair oil :)

3189 2018-04-02 17:26:43 I also think we will see some sort of glass window where the screen is like the Lucas oil stadium
3190 2018-04-02 17:26:42 Only smelt flower bread from Hastings will do with truffle oil

3194 2018-04-02 17:26:06 I really could give a rats ass who you do or don’t bow to. In looking back at this thread you’re making assumptions based on you own internal dialogue. I have an oil well to drill     The liberals need the tax revenue. You have a good day.

As a life long Oiler fan I’m perfectly positioned to assess temporary slips.

Oil will be back with vicious vengeance next year!

Oilers will be next Canadian team to win Stanley Cup!

3202 2018-04-02 17:25:03 Can @theSNP please tell the people of Scotland if Westminster intend to  allow military services into schools in deprived areas to enlist children? If so we need to stop this. Our children are not cannon fodder for rich men's wars over oil.
3203 2018-04-02 17:24:59 Always contested this assertion. Know of countries with oil/resource billionaires;govts dont provide in terms of social protection/public services/free amenities at level of Botswana. How can they be less unequal?  Long lobbied for study on this falsehood.
3204 2018-04-02 17:24:49 My city has ever paid me for a gas or oil connection / furnace. That's false.  Per kilowatt of power generated, the subsidies given to the green energy scams is astronomical AND they provide ZERO benefit to anyone.  They result in no measurable reduction in global atmospheric CO2
3205 2018-04-02 17:24:48 By oil and gas "types" you mean the industry itself, mostly foreign owned and taxed at a fraction of what these corporations pay elsewhere, costing Canadians billions while leaving billions in pollution for us to deal with. Who cares about their opinions on the NDP?
3206 2018-04-02 17:24:46 This dude literally fried the damn rice in a skillet and some oil 
3207 2018-04-02 17:24:46 You guys are missing out it has the goodness of mashed potatoes but the crispy ness of a good French fry and if you olive oil+salt the peel before you cook it it comes out so crunchy and good
3208 2018-04-02 17:24:36 This is an urgent requirement for a an upstream oil & gas company with office in Abuja. 
Please note that deadline for submission is 12noon Tuesday(3rd April 2018) as shortlisted candidates would be contacted for interview at Abuja on Wednesday 04/04/2018.

3210 2018-04-02 17:24:32 I want all of their arms to fall off just to see what the Coconut oil salesman does.
3211 2018-04-02 17:24:16 If only you actually knew, what the hell you were talking about, even once!  Republicans love the free market. I guess this tweet proves that you are NO REPUBLICAN!!! Didn't oil companies get a massive tax cut recently? Gas prices sure have been going way up lately.  #GOPTaxScam
3212 2018-04-02 17:24:00 I love it when im downwind of someone who starts vaping phat clouds of what I can only assume is shit flavored oil
3213 2018-04-02 17:23:58 PS. Why are you obsessed with Vlad? Arctic oil? Real estate? What other schemes do you have for self-enrichment from your presidency?
3214 2018-04-02 17:23:52 I do not think so. The shale oil physical particularities makes oil and gas extraction interlinked. For Russia, Gazprom treats its oil biz like a cash cow used to finance its gas biz. For Lukoil/Rosneft it is the contrary... (Rosneft being more ambitious for the gas market)
3215 2018-04-02 17:23:48 £1.99 for coconut oil that lasts you months
3216 2018-04-02 17:23:45 It smells better than Jamaican black castor oil
3217 2018-04-02 17:23:45 @atxvapeandsmoke Help settle a debate on the show: We see CBD Oil available for sale on your site, but is there a definitive answer on the legality of CBD Oil in Texas? Thanks! #herewego
3218 2018-04-02 17:23:44 CeCe's voters, more oil to una fingers.
3219 2018-04-02 17:23:28 Awe. Hope there's a game left between the Oil and the 'Nucks. Would be awesome to have the whole team line up for handshakes afterwards like they did for Smytty. #madrespect #sportsmanship
3220 2018-04-02 17:23:27 Europe is willing to let Iran go nuclear so long as Iranian oil flows into Europe. 

Imagine the price of oil, Europe, once Iran invades Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE, and no one can stop Iran because it bristles with tactical nuclear weapons. 

Insanity.
3221 2018-04-02 17:23:15 Let's see I've spilled oil on my self, olive juice, got yelled at and cussed at and 3 pairs of gloves with holes whilst I was touching nasty stuff. All in a Mondays work.
3222 2018-04-02 17:23:12 soooo in love with Kemiri Oil!!! They're like my second Holy Grail after Lord Lip Kits 
3223 2018-04-02 17:23:11 What I don’t understand is why would you make the budget more dependent on oil?  We are in this mess because oil went from over $100 to the $20’s.  So we raise taxes on it even more.  Do the honest thing and raise income tax.  We are all going to pay for it anyway.
3224 2018-04-02 17:22:45 they can use it to drill for more oil
3225 2018-04-02 17:22:33 I was running low on oil and just reached into my mountain of empty flower containers trying to get lucky and pulled out a bong pack of Platinum GSC.  I feel very wook today

3227 2018-04-02 17:22:13 We can provide a little bit of housing stipend for them to get places. Maybe if our oil ceos didn’t make millions and billions

3235 2018-04-02 17:21:00 Sometimes you gotta take things out of context and west-wash what happened so it'll fit your virtue-signaling white guilt needs. Smh Western people suck. All you people want is to have others pat you on the back and say how progressive you are, as you pour oil over a fire 
3236 2018-04-02 17:20:59 Looking at the early inner stadium concepts, very happy with the home end, pitch proximity, safe standing, enclosed nature, Dan clearly gets it, the outer will be interesting to see, though it’s looking like the Lucas Oil stadium which I love on the inside  #EvertonStadium

3246 2018-04-02 17:20:07 Branching out and taking an oil painting class but didn’t have time to finish getting all my supplies together, so Ernest finished the shopping for me. I basically feel like Angela did when Dwight went to corporate for her.

3251 2018-04-02 17:19:45 @narendramodi @PMOIndia putting my thinking cap on, I can't think of a relief you have given in these 4 years to middle class.

3262 2018-04-02 17:18:43 @PMOIndia @narendramodi instead of sending spokesperson on tv channels to defend oil prices, why can't the oil prices be reduced.
Why can't you come out with a solution.
3263 2018-04-02 17:18:41 Spending half your day off running errands is so meh. Oil change, car inspection, renew registration, blah blah blah.

3265 2018-04-02 17:18:06 is the oil pure vitamin E? if so, maybe test out using it every other day at night and see how your skin reacts. it should be fine! vitamin E is so good for your skin when used in a way your skin likes, and it usually won’t cause any acne or clogged pores

3272 2018-04-02 17:17:35 Ah, no worries. Technically if you pressed the whole cod it Would be an essential oil. 
3273 2018-04-02 17:17:22 Today right now God exists, I know.

3274 2018-04-02 17:17:19 Government deregulated saying selling price will be determined by market forces vis a vis crude oil prices. What is happening now? Cruel joke.
3275 2018-04-02 17:17:03 @PMOIndia @narendramodi don't you think that the oil prices are way too much for us?
First poorly made finance budget with no relief for middle class. Now such high fuel prices.

3283 2018-04-02 17:15:59 When the price for oil tanked a couple of years ago, did Oklahoma have any money it could use to continue to fund education at levels that are needed? No, because @GovMaryFallin and the #okleg didn’t have the foresight to imagine the price of oil ever tanking.
3284 2018-04-02 17:15:57 He's not interested in facts, it's all about allowing pollution so the almighty oil buck remains unscathed.

3286 2018-04-02 17:15:48 Russia is a massive country with GDP of Spain. They have no exports aside from oil. They have declining birth rate. They are failing.

Trump treats Russia like an economic equal, wants to give Putin perception of power. 

Trump refuses to punish Russia for their crimes.

Why?

3310 2018-04-02 17:13:18 Global crude oil prices had plummeted between mid-2014 to mid-2016 but since july 2017 prices shot up by 47% which resulted in your fuel bills soaring. Our dependency on fuel imports has swelled over the years. Naturally, imports edging up, our import bill is set to rise #lka
3311 2018-04-02 17:13:09 Thank god Scott Foster played in Chicago and not Edmonton. If a beer league goalie played 14 NHL minutes in Oil Country, you can guarantee that dude would spend the rest of his life circling The Pint downtown telling as many girls as he can about his NHL career.
3312 2018-04-02 17:13:04 อืมมมเราคิดว่าเทใจให้ไปทาง oil ค่ะ

3314 2018-04-02 17:13:03 Also you Oklahoma voters, make note who supports our great Oklahoma teachers! Make a note of those legislators who choose big oil over our teachers and kids education. #oklahomateacherwalkout
3315 2018-04-02 17:12:55 During the most recent oil & gas production boom Oklahoma kept slashing the state education budget year after year after year. The #okleg & @GovMaryFallin cut the education budget even though the state had adequate money coming in. Does that make sense to anyone?
3316 2018-04-02 17:12:53 Something have to be real wrong I just got my oil changed and it’s telling me to change oil

3320 2018-04-02 17:12:24 Oil companies are the something-for-nothing socialists.   They get everything they want from the state house.  Enough.

3325 2018-04-02 17:11:49 Yes.  His father Pierre was also PM years ago and absolutely destroyed Alberta's oil economy.  So you can imagine how popular his son is in the Conservative west.  The main difference between the two is that Pierre's IQ was 'above' 100.

I'd start with two and work your way up. Ibuprofen can be rough on your body.  Best to call dentist though.

3350 2018-04-02 17:09:32 Might be because Canadian oil can not reliably be shipped to world markets! The Trudeau government and the left hypocrites that think sewage in our waterways is fine but oil pipelines are not, have destroyed the Canadian energy market! Absolutely sickening!

3354 2018-04-02 17:09:12 Finally some realism setting in. Trump might have other faults, but some of his hunches are right, and good for Americans, middle east, Arab-Israeli relationships. Bad news for Wahabis, war mongers who have never been to a war, short sighted oil barons and some Israeli lobbyists.

3356 2018-04-02 17:08:38 Trudeau has no intention of building that pipeline and his pathetic attempts to fake sincerity are doing nothing for the fast sinking economy, only makes our leader look guilty of intentionally sabotaging our oil industry so the US interests can benefit

3384 2018-04-02 17:05:15 disagreements don't mean we arguing . but wealthy people have been using "philanthropy " to not pay taxes on their oil rigs and politics.  churches ( all though some) are the least to worry about , because so many ppl are tax exempt.  but real churches,  preachers don't make $$

3389 2018-04-02 17:04:20 Ok i agree, My point is that in 2014 Average of 98 Per Barrel for crude oil that comes to 64 Now. Why the common Man not getting benefit of That.

3401 2018-04-02 17:02:55 This isn’t primarily because of climate change, though. It’s because the Army Corps of Engineers built the levees on the Mississippi River to stop flooding and sediment didn’t keep flowing. And, the oil lines to the Gulf. Everyone in Louisiana knows this.

3429 2018-04-02 17:00:11 Um no. My point is you're saying tough gun laws will benefit criminals. I'm showing that criminals love your current gun laws as they purchase many guns legally.

3450 2018-04-02 16:56:48 Coconut oil can do right by you if you use it right. Pink Oil is completely useless
3451 2018-04-02 16:56:39 I lied about nothing.  I’m producing 90K+ bbl oil per day, along with 145MW power generation from “dirty” fossil fuels.  I’m willing to debate you and look at your “evidence”, but call me a liar once more and we’re done
3452 2018-04-02 16:56:20 But we've got a manager who needs to show off how smart he is and how advanced they are with analytics.  He's an idiot who is being exposed and so is the GM who hired him.  This is the reason they cleaned out the staff, so coconut oil could do his thing

3471 2018-04-02 16:54:21 Washington Post Josh Rogin, after Trump's announcement of leaving Syria lamented, “We took the oil. We’ve got to keep the oil!” The mask of pseudo-humanitarian high-minded noble ideals comes off (the Josh Rogins of the world care nothing about actual Syrians). Oil! Oil! Iran!
3472 2018-04-02 16:54:14 Place the rice flakes in a bowl and rinse them with cold water. Soak them in fresh cold water and set aside.
Heat a pan on a medium heat and add the oil. Tip in a few of the mustard seeds. If they sizzle, the oil is ready. Add the remaining seeds and sauté for a few seconds.

3475 2018-04-02 16:53:58 exactly,I accede to this. If there was none, men and women will begin to exploit more Oil from that Organ up there(brain)
3476 2018-04-02 16:53:55 Cod liver oil is not an essential oil. 

This newsletter was more a warning about cats having the inability to metabolize most concentrated plant essential oils and why it could be bad for them.
3477 2018-04-02 16:53:53 Not much oil in Syria.
3478 2018-04-02 16:53:52 No, denying nuclear power’s benefits is ludicrous. Denying that oil pollutes, cars kill, and there’s no evidence that AVs solve for either - THAT’S ludicrous.

Paisley changes her mind often.
3493 2018-04-02 16:51:15 She had to lick up all the oil just to get out

3495 2018-04-02 16:51:13 Tried to sleep tonight without it, but my minds still awake. Gave up and put a bit of HN lavender oil, and my eyes are now closing 
3496 2018-04-02 16:51:02 I think the oil may be something else tbh, cow milk doesn’t have oil in it lol

3518 2018-04-02 16:49:00 Have you researched what Rockefeller did? It's quite far reaching as is the reach of of Google. I don't take these things lightly. Standard Oil is at the root of most of our problems today. Google is now the purveyor of censorship and mind control.

3523 2018-04-02 16:48:17 What she tweeted is just some western ideology, If you take away the part she talk about rape and child molestation and we are all aware you are referring to those that lost it on moral ground.

3532 2018-04-02 16:47:50 If your income depends on peddling solar panels and/or wind turbines I won't bug you anymore. You have the right to provide for your family. But please, be sincere.
MY income does not depend on any type of energy company except that I travel a LOT and thus I need loads of oil.
3533 2018-04-02 16:47:34 The best way to make food taste better is to drizzle olive oil.

Brownie? Olive oil.

It’s ALL good. Unless you’re allergic to olives... then don’t eat any food I give you.

3541 2018-04-02 16:47:04 Under Thomas' logic, grocery store clerks are salespeople. The Associate at Home Depot would also be a salesperson. No car service provider had ever come up to me and tried to sell me an oil change. No store clerk has ever tried to sell me milk. This is a BS ruling.

3561 2018-04-02 16:45:11 Sure. I wasn't trying to make any comment on that. Meta point is that could watch Black Panther and wonder what our society would be like if we had vibranium. We do, and it is this black liquid (or tar sands) we get (also) from the ground. Not a pro oil statement.

3571 2018-04-02 16:43:43 It was Carter not Reagan who battled for two years to pass legislation that gradually expanded competition in natural gas, oil, and electricity. U.S. inflation was fueled by rising energy prices between 1972 & 1979 linked to OPEC & instability in the Middle East.

3580 2018-04-02 16:42:13 Races to the bottom are good things.    You know what the real bottom is?  Venezuela had free healthcare and they couldn’t maintain it because oil prices went south.  Now you have doctors digging through garbage piles to find food.
3581 2018-04-02 16:42:02 it’s not the oil execs, it’s the legislators in the capitol. those businesses are private, they have nothing to do with the funding coming out of the capitol. this is all the legislatures fault for cutting the budget for over a decade
3582 2018-04-02 16:41:57 How can you claim an anti-imperialist character for "Rojava" when Yankee propogandists are openly gloating about "owning" Syrian oil fields through their YPG/SDF proxies. The Yanks are proud to be occupiers & thieves while throwing scraps to their lap dogs.
3583 2018-04-02 16:41:54 "signs of fear abounded. The VIX (VIX) volatility index jumped more than 15%. Crude oil plunged about 3%. Gold, which tends to do well when investors are worried, climbed more than 1%"

Nearly every single driver in Dubai hails from Pakistan.

3586 2018-04-02 16:41:33 On the risk side, there are global risks. However, for the moment global oil prices are increasing. This will have 3 outcomes for Sri Lanka (1) remittances from the gulf will stabilise (2) the import cost will rise and (3) cost of production will increase #lka
3587 2018-04-02 16:41:27 I'm thinking that this must mean you lament the lack of horse carriage dealerships, and you can't buy whale oil for your lamps, and you can't treat your spouse like a slave? I am hopeful we'll find meaningful work for all the unemployed because of technology/change. 
3588 2018-04-02 16:41:22 They want your children, to fight and die for their oil.
3589 2018-04-02 16:41:15 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?

3602 2018-04-02 16:39:35 @dpradhanbjp1. If you are telling international markets are responsible for fuel prices rising then y did Modi tell before elections he will decrease the petrol prices Ohhh this is also jumla of your pm. Even though the crude oil prices are low.
3603 2018-04-02 16:39:21 Shorted oil at 65 this morning per your weekend post. Moving stops to b/e. Let’s see if this can turn into a nice swing trade. Specs massively long for quite some time now too
3604 2018-04-02 16:39:20 Needa get an oil change rn ..... before I end up stressing lol
3605 2018-04-02 16:39:16 definitely a puzzle.  think a big part of the answer was that underlying pace of demand growth in 14 before the oil shock was very very strong (unsustainably so).   were looking for a rise off a very high base when in reality the base was too high so to speak
3606 2018-04-02 16:39:14 Petrol m diesel prices are highest in USA also and around the world. Guess the pappu gang is unaware of global oil price rise...

3618 2018-04-02 16:37:54 Excellent point. They can put their money where their mouths are, and Resist. 

I work in solar. We call it the "solar coaster". We're used to having big oil mess with us constantly, but we always find a way to stand up for what we believe in, and turn that into real power.

3634 2018-04-02 16:35:42 Decaying forests give off as much greenhouse gasses as car exhaust. Its the wasteful process of removing the oil, shipping it to be refined, then shipping it back. To make the already rich, more rich and hurtful towards earth. Thats where you start
3635 2018-04-02 16:35:23 And now big oil is objecting to tax hike , so add oil to guns and bibles as more important than teachers. How about adding football as well
3636 2018-04-02 16:35:00 Peep the trend. Anywhere where there’s a lot of natural resources and lots of oil the people there will always be poor and left for dead because of greed.

3653 2018-04-02 16:33:56 Your right in principle. In practice, the big puzzle in 2014/5 was that the oil price drop didn’t translate into stronger household consumption, so the net impact in that instance was negative. Interesting question is why of course. Perhaps still households fixing balance sheets.
3654 2018-04-02 16:33:48 Interest rate rise threats, inflation, oil prices.. all these also have a huge influence on spending and are nothing to do with Brexit. Keep grasping.

3685 2018-04-02 16:29:57 I still talk about a cycle of increasing subsidies when oil prices go up and reduced revenues when they go down.

3714 2018-04-02 16:25:54 Argan oil on my face 
3715 2018-04-02 16:25:45 My dad just checked my oil, filled my tires, and vacuumed and dusted the inside of my car because I'm driving to Omaha with DSP this weekend. He takes such good care of me. 
3716 2018-04-02 16:25:22 the problem is to reposition the thousands of people and companies that gravitate around the oil .... it's not easy it takes its time ..
3717 2018-04-02 16:25:21 I'm with you, had a conversation with my brother about this new type of phone company, never looked it up, nothing... just a verbal conversation. About 4 hours later the exact company we were discussing came up in ad. Scared the crap out of me. Our phones are listening
3718 2018-04-02 16:25:15 The might want more money but they definitely don’t need more money with all the oil tycoons in their alumni base-so we will have to agree to disagree!

3721 2018-04-02 16:25:07 KC, you're almost right. Purchase after DV conviction is illegal BUT possession after DV conviction is not (except in some states). The difference is subtle, but the result is DV perps keeping their guns.

3725 2018-04-02 16:24:52 I’ve been cleansed by a Shaman twice, in 2 different locations & still have ‘returnees’.
I protect myself w/ Saging, Cedar oil & a lot of ‘back off’s!’ ~ it is a constant dance...
3726 2018-04-02 16:24:38 uhh when did oil changes get so expensive my bank account is offended
3727 2018-04-02 16:24:30 Don't disrespect one of your former teams you mug. Just remember before the Russian oil man's money came in, your lot were irrelevant and nearly folded.
3728 2018-04-02 16:24:25 Can you put oil deficit figures along with these??
3729 2018-04-02 16:23:37 [Chuckling as some of the flour puffs up, I lean over and gently rub her nose clean, nodding my head as I hand her the whisk.] Now you need to use this to mix it all together. [I lean against the counter and drop a small amount of oil in to the bowl, quickly >

3731 2018-04-02 16:23:10 First oil change for the @Honda Odyssey. Love how dealers go out of their way to make it as painful as the buying process.

Her gloves were dirtied with motor oil, ash, and other dried up chemical substances that couldn't be quite washed off. A cloth bandage was around her ankle where she'd been -
3734 2018-04-02 16:22:49 I hate going to get my oil changed
3735 2018-04-02 16:22:48 "Data is the new oil!" ~Clive Humby
3736 2018-04-02 16:22:45 Lol, so what did I say that was wrong?

DV conviction prohibits possession. There is no grandfather clause.

Restraining orders also, temporarily, prohibit possession.

You want to restrict rights based on an arrest, not a conviction. That violates due process.

3743 2018-04-02 16:21:41 I never even inquired about an oil change! After they told me the prices for them tires i pretended they didnt exist anymore totally deleted them from my life
3744 2018-04-02 16:21:25 Bruh like a month or so ago i hit something in a construction zone it was pouring and i blew my tire on the back passenger side. But apparently it fucked up all this other stuff. Mind you i’ve had an oil change and multipoint inspection since then

3748 2018-04-02 16:21:17 Hey, remember the other day when I was shouting about how screwed up #Oklahoma is w/r/t prioritizing oil companies over all else? I should clarify that Oklahomans themselves are good people. The politicians and millionaires should all be fired and guillotined. #OklaEd

3781 2018-04-02 16:18:10 isn't the net impact of the oil shock close to zero?  negative on investment, positive for consumption?  would argue that it isn't linear, and that from say $100 to $70 the consumption side is dominant given US breakeven prices, and from $70 to $40 it might be slightly negative

3793 2018-04-02 16:16:48 I am trying to cook macaroni/spaghetti here alone. The pot filled half with cooking oil and onions is already boiling. 

Do I now put the macaroni and mince meat in the pot at the same time or which one comes first? Those who can cook?

Shortage of USD, tightning of financial conditions, as this “recovery” gets long in it’s tooth. Oil will drop imo - USD soar - and inflation bounce will be done.

3809 2018-04-02 16:14:15 yes...and the people hurt would also include China.
World oil markets would go insane and need to immediately be priced against??? The EUR... but they'd be effected too.

3857 2018-04-02 16:10:03 My last avocado toast was very simple. Goat cheese (I blended it with a bit of milk to be able to spread it like I would with cream cheese) avocado (this time in slices). Pepper. A bit of olive oil. That's it. Very dairy friendly but could always find vegan options

3861 2018-04-02 16:09:48 I’ll never understand why people pay for an oil change...do you realize how easy it is just to do it yourself?
3862 2018-04-02 16:09:26 The waiting room at the Honda dealership is playing fox and honestly this has been the longest oil change of my life
3863 2018-04-02 16:09:26 Bout to go get a oil change

3866 2018-04-02 16:08:37 I have lived and worked in the uae, it is thanks to the 80% imported labour & the oil that uae is so well built.
3867 2018-04-02 16:08:33 I know..D has a well paid job but struggles with 2 growing toddlers..shoes are a fortune. We mind & feed them 2 days a week..which helps out. Things were much cheaper in the 1950s when I was growing up, and we had free orange juice & cod liver oil

3870 2018-04-02 16:08:08 Hi Henrik its a game of sequencing. Yes if the $ explodes and oil implodes inflation collapses. But what's the driver of that move? My bet is rate hikes. Don't forget that with inflation its the YoY change in oil that's key. At around current levels the YoY rate hits 50% in June.
3871 2018-04-02 16:08:01 And THIS neanderthal approach is how Trump businesses go bankrupt and fail. Is this a budding awareness of how the government can be used to be pro-business? Unlikely. Whataboutisms: min wage subsidies, oil subsidies, etc.

3875 2018-04-02 16:07:44 I’ve heard of people massaging castor oil into their scalp. I’ve only used it for my eyelashes and eyebrows but I noticed a difference there.

3881 2018-04-02 16:07:14 Maybe they put coconut water in it or oil that’s why it has a film over the top. If it had cow milk it wouldn’t have that

3893 2018-04-02 16:06:02 It takes 10,000 roses to fill a single 5 ml bottle, equals to 60 roses for a drop of essential oil.

Once you inhale the aroma, it takes few seconds for your brain to sense and alter your emotional state rapidly.

3901 2018-04-02 16:05:03 Oil extraction of any kind will be harmful- time to revive @FFFernhurst ?
3902 2018-04-02 16:04:54 Exactly. I am not even saying refund. At least exchange.Compensate somehow and fast too. My sis asked me to buy coconut oil for my mum. When I got it, it was like they dipped it in fuel. I called and just explained/Washed the bottle thinking I could manage it.

3906 2018-04-02 16:04:16 The trick to getting restaurant style non-sticky separation is

2. Immediately run it under cold water till room temperature 
3. Pour sesame oil generously to keep them from sticking

3953 2018-04-02 15:59:52 Daniel, you have proof of Amazon bribes? Who was bribed? How much did they pay? I think you are confusing bribes with lobbyist. All big businesses lobby (AKA "bribes"). All the big businesses got a huge tax break from the GOP. You are just a squeaky wheel wanting some oil.
3954 2018-04-02 15:59:43 Time for Oil Change
3955 2018-04-02 15:59:41 @lilianaytx Unfortunately, that's not in our wheelhouse. We do oil changes and tires. We hope it gets fixed soon though!
3956 2018-04-02 15:59:40 Yes. The move to prevent safety regulations from applying to AVs is a part of the oil industry’s strategy of “predatory delay.” Rather than focus on proven safety interventions, they’re trying to distract us with unproven statements such as “AVs will be safer.”
3957 2018-04-02 15:59:35 มาแล้ววว
3958 2018-04-02 15:59:34 @MaryFallin Maybe you keep children from quality education so that they have no choice but to go to work in the oil fields. Maybe you do it because you know those without a college degree are more likely to vote for your party. We all see through you.
3959 2018-04-02 15:59:32 Impressed you had the filters in stock for it.  Those cars were so easy to change oil and filters back in the day.
3960 2018-04-02 15:59:30 You ever take castor oil, Big Ray?
3961 2018-04-02 15:59:29 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
3962 2018-04-02 15:59:24 @jasoncundy05 only after being bankrolled by a corrupt Russian oil tycoon - I wouldn’t shout about it too much in the current climate. You may have more trophies but you have far far less class - As Poch said if we win a trophy we will have earned it not bought it 
3963 2018-04-02 15:59:21 Sandy, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride @gayvancouver how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil.
3964 2018-04-02 15:59:14 so, oklahoma teachers earn the same amount as I did fueling aircraft.

For an oil state, this is absurd, insane, and a sign that some company or ten is avoiding taxes. So, mass theft.

3973 2018-04-02 15:58:00 supporting oil pipelines through native lands, dismantling the epa, cutting benefits for our most needy, suppressing clean energy, cutting education funding, using taxpayer $$$ to pay for vacations and dining room tables, etc. etc. etc. i really could go on for days...

3978 2018-04-02 15:56:59 Bringing like me back in this, eh? Carbon Tax is just that realizing that in killing the planet we should invest in ways to right our wrongs. The future needs to be green. Yes We need oil in the next 50 years but after that we will need to have harnessed other renewable sources.
3979 2018-04-02 15:56:49 This oil change taking forever dawggg
3980 2018-04-02 15:56:35 Using 00 flour, making it from scratch, with EVOO olive oil on base, semolina, sea salt, roma tomato mashed and sieved for pizza sauce, Buffala mozzerella or hand made if you can get it, fresh basil and make yourself a good ol margherita pizza.

3989 2018-04-02 15:55:42 Why is everything soaked in so much oil? And how is this considered healthy?
3990 2018-04-02 15:55:39 Except it's illegal to possess them. Do you understand words?

The law isn't "well you can't have them but feel free to keep them."
3991 2018-04-02 15:55:39 I became convinced of medical uses when I watched a documentary of a little girl with seizures, sometimes hundreds a day. Her parents had to move the family across the country, to a state where they can get the oil legally. Such a change, she now has a normal life.
3992 2018-04-02 15:55:24 .@lampidicsparrow Oil is leaking.
3993 2018-04-02 15:55:20 @MaryFallin Why don’t you tax your oil buddies the original 7% to help fund education instead of taxing everyone else so the teachers can keep their raises? Why don’t you use that extra revenue to help invest in Oklahoma childrens’ futures instead of putting them in prison?
3994 2018-04-02 15:55:07 So many times excise duties hike , Bt there is no reason at all . Fault formula implemented in oil sector.

4000 2018-04-02 15:54:33 Oh yeah. There was a time when oil companies paid subsidies to schools and colleges so they could train the people that would work for there companies. It was a win-win situation.

That stopped in the 80s.
4001 2018-04-02 15:54:21 Funny but he is showing leadership; unlike our current governments in power. If you don’t think we need pipelines and oil and jobs and the services it pays for, you are just as delusional as Notley and Trudeau

I believe they are purposely melting the ice caps to get to the oil. They are allowing people to believe #ClimateChange is caused by something we are doing.
4034 2018-04-02 15:51:07 It's the Man City wages that are daft though. It's a bit depressing imo. A club that has so much money (due to oil) that they can throw whatever they like at an English football club. I'm sorry, but it's absolutely ridiculous, and spoils my enjoyment of football tbh.

4067 2018-04-02 15:47:57 They recommend 'lean meats' and 'small portions of red meat'. I think they're missing something: It's the fat (olive oil, butter, fatty animal proteins) that helps avert/reduce depression.

4109 2018-04-02 15:42:58 Lower tariffs also reduced import prices. America's largest import is oil. The U.S. imported $144.2 billion in oil from Mexico and Canada. This figure was down from $157.8 billion in 2007. NAFTA reduced U.S. reliance on oil imports from the Middle East and Venezuela.

4129 2018-04-02 15:41:09 @BPCLimited in manmohan Singh regime cruid oil was on average 105 dollars/barrel and petrol price was avg 75 rs / lit but in Modi regime cruid oil avg 60 dollar/barrel and petrol is at avg 77 /lit. Dollar conversion rate almost same. Why...? #LootLo
4130 2018-04-02 15:40:51 Y r u not reducing high fuel prices,instead of increasing oil taxes & burdening common people,u could have privatised Oil PSUs & raised resources.Oil prices will be a key factor in defeat of Modi in 2019
4131 2018-04-02 15:40:49 Yup. It's obnoxious. And the worst part is that's not the only way to create additional revenue. Specialized taxes is one - Oil, marijuana, alcohol, etc. Hell, Colorado could probably live off of marijuana taxes alone right now. Need the state to think outside the box here.

4134 2018-04-02 15:40:43 No. They said the snow and that they don't pull in driveways. There was 2 inches of snow & an oil truck had no problem as well as our family car. & now they can't come back until Wednesday? When it is on the truck driving around today.

4139 2018-04-02 15:40:03 The chemical structure of jojoba oil resembles sebum, the natural skin oil produced by the sebaceous glands. Sebum moisturizes the scalp and helps reduce hair loss. Jojoba oil readily penetrates the hair follicles, dissolves the build ups and frees the follicle for further growth

4144 2018-04-02 15:39:41 Completely agree, it's snake oil sold by con men acting as pseudo-psychologists. Supposedly designed to 'make people feel better about themselves'. Oh sure, what's not to like about being labelled 'introverted and judging' - such a positive stereotype don't  you think?

4148 2018-04-02 15:39:32 They clearly only drove here to get paid for work, they didn't do & they can't blame the snow because 2 minutes later we had an oil delivery with no problem. They also said they don't pull in driveways! The man didn't know how to drive & destroyed our yard too.
4149 2018-04-02 15:39:31 I need to get my oil changed before I head back to LC
4150 2018-04-02 15:39:28 Increase in oil prices= increase in ALL prices.
4151 2018-04-02 15:39:28 Also, the whole proposition that the general public thinks the same dude who calls you with the estimate is also the guy who installs your new break pads and changes the oil is a little bit silly IMO.

4158 2018-04-02 15:38:49 Snake oil vendors are typically pretty good at selling their products LOL but in all seriousness, value in the tech might not translate directly into the value of a token in some cases.
4159 2018-04-02 15:38:38 He's probably thinking of the old oil company with the dinosaur logo.
4160 2018-04-02 15:38:29 So he seems to be increasing the oil prices daily 
4161 2018-04-02 15:38:26 Then how else do you explain the ctax and divestment away from oil in Canada and into renewables?
4162 2018-04-02 15:38:24 You know these days when you wake up and see a message from an old business partner saying. "Hey, I need 200 ton of sunflower oil, can you arrange that for me?" 
Those days doesnt even feel odd anymore, just another day in #Ukraine
4163 2018-04-02 15:38:18 It's a good think the oil isn't going to run out anytime soon.
4164 2018-04-02 15:38:10 Oil is free from GST..then the price is increasing which pinches the pocket of customers..

4172 2018-04-02 15:37:36 Their actions as a minority government managed to minimize the impacts of the global recession, but they really lost the plot when they got a majority and made Canada ridiculously sensitive to global oil price drops that barely impacted more diverse economies

4188 2018-04-02 15:36:08 Or are you high on oil fumes? Or maybe the scent off plastic seats that have never been sat on.
4189 2018-04-02 15:36:06 With all respect, but I really don't see how you get to that conclusion. I agree, that secular inflation might be bottoming - but on a shorter/medium term I would argue that we are seeing the contrary. Dis-inflation. Inflation will dip as oil drops and USD soars imo. All best :)

4193 2018-04-02 15:35:16 Sir your observation is totally political, international oil & gas industry doesn't work as your describing, we are still buying Oil & Gas from Iran on instalment payment options and credit lines despite low oil prices, it's not only with Iran with whom we have this facility.

4260 2018-04-02 15:28:56 Especially if they fail due to shady tactics.  That’s a FREE market.  Not what we have now.  For instance, if OIL and Elec Utilities crush TESLA using the government’s help in the coming years, we’ve got major issues.
4261 2018-04-02 15:28:53 So first day of spring quarter is going swell: I got up for an 8am that ended at 8:08. I attempted to pump up my flat bike tire and flattened it more. And got oil all over my hands which won't come off.
4262 2018-04-02 15:28:32 In 2014 dharmendra babu planned to reserve the crude oil to avoid any crisis and control over prices but still not implemented
4263 2018-04-02 15:28:22 だわね。(やべぇネタ切れした)
4264 2018-04-02 15:28:22 The reason for the spike is GREED, plain & simple !!! Gas prices have gone up over 40 cents in the past month - doesn't matter when oil prices fluctuate !!! I think it's time for another letter to the A.G. to look into this price gouging !!!
4265 2018-04-02 15:28:19 It will be a strange sort of a book, I fear; blubber is blubber you know; though you may get oil out of it, the poetry runs as hard as sap from a frozen maple tree...

4275 2018-04-02 15:27:28 @LilyNicholsRDN Most reliable indicator for quality olive oil is not "native/extra/virgin" etc., it`s the price. You don`t get quality - pure - oil below 40 Euro/l (Germany)
That also means ... no quality olive oil in supermarkets!
Cheap oils ARE imposters, you can count on that.

4281 2018-04-02 15:26:41 What's not healthy about it? Eggs, oil, and the chicken broth gives me some trace protein and nutrients, and all the electrolytes I need! It's great! Tastes a little funky, especially together, but you get used to it.
4282 2018-04-02 15:26:37 If the oil is adulterated, likely the nutrition label is fraudulent. How can the consumer tell good olive oil before buying it?
4283 2018-04-02 15:26:34 Unaware of the #FuelPriceBomb my neighbour was flaunting his new car today. Little does he know about the fuel prices being high despite a fall in crude oil price. #ModiGovernment 's impact you see.  #FuelPriceHike #betrayedagain #aamaadmibudget
4284 2018-04-02 15:26:31 Hey hey hey!!!!

Education is a right and it is a cruel thing that teachers have to work 2 jobs because the state of Oklahoma cares more about oil companies than it does about its educators.
4285 2018-04-02 15:26:28 With Gold going upstairs whilst oil & indices fall deep after (Bitcoin) afterall... ‘If enough participants trade in a comodity it gains indication potential’, gold, as it stands, right now trades in a little panic.

4287 2018-04-02 15:26:14 Pep is coward thats why he choose city. City at that time got de bruyne, silva, aguero, sterling, otamendi & oil wells. On the other side united needs a full overhaul that will take time.
4288 2018-04-02 15:26:12 Yes and particularly for Alberta. What amazes me is the upstream and DOWNSTREAM emissions testing.  Really?  No one could sell oil under those circumstances.
4289 2018-04-02 15:26:09 I just want to cover myself in coconut oil and lay on a beach for the rest of my life

4299 2018-04-02 15:25:16 Good Morning, dear. It was lovely, hope yours was the same!
I love to cook so I made a lot of favorite Spring dishes which disappeared in record time. I'm now hoping a small plate I hid of crackled ham w/maple syrup squash & black sesame asparagus seared in walnut oil survived.

4301 2018-04-02 15:24:54 Got my lashes soaked in olive oil...need them off like right now!!
4302 2018-04-02 15:24:46 All political parties says something when in opposition and does the alternate when in power about oil.
4303 2018-04-02 15:24:46 China plans 700 new coal plants. US will surpass 10 million BPD oil production. China and India oil imports up substantially in 2017. Paris what?
4304 2018-04-02 15:24:43 ช้ำใจขอเหล้าเข้มๆค่ะ
4305 2018-04-02 15:24:41 We were in the midst of the global meltdown, true. The last recession here started because of CPC policy and their entire platform relying on oil money. The US was booming, we should have been too. Bad fiscal management and policy just came to light because of the drop in oil.
4306 2018-04-02 15:24:36 Now BJP & BJD are in a logger heads to find out each other'faultto make an issue so oil politics emerged
4307 2018-04-02 15:24:33 Govt of Odisha & India- both should be serious on this oil price/ it's becoming more confusing day by day for common people- the mechanism should be transparent
4308 2018-04-02 15:24:32 Honestly when I got my NYY shirt I wore the CRAP out of it. Got oil on it while cooking, and now it’s a workout shirt
4309 2018-04-02 15:24:25 I twitted trump to keep oil in his pocket when he arrives.

4317 2018-04-02 15:23:40 I honestly don't know why people vote Republican in Oklahoma. They are ruining my state by giving oil companies billions.
4318 2018-04-02 15:23:39 I think I’m pretty much made of coconut oil at this point
4319 2018-04-02 15:23:37 I will forever go to Meineke for an oil change
4320 2018-04-02 15:23:32 Taxes on oil contribute to significant amount of revenue for state and central govt... it might be more apt if while proposing for reduction in taxes on these items, panel may also recommend the head under which the expenses could be reduced.  It will make more sense.
4321 2018-04-02 15:23:22 That was the 'practice' one on 14 Feb! This time, it's for real!

If you had no OIL, you'd be safe and secure, today. I pray for your comfort and deliverance. I pray that abusers get what they've earned.
4324 2018-04-02 15:23:13 It's still not as transparent as what the libs are trying to do to our 2nd Amendment rights.
4325 2018-04-02 15:23:08 Norway’s oil and gas sector is only 12% of GDP (US is around 8%). But it does help maintain Norway’s generous welfare state, due to the fact that Statoil is govt founded and reaps profits. It’s more (not less) evidence of a Nordic system socialist/capitalist compromise.

4328 2018-04-02 15:22:29 Yes! 

Our country is being stolen. 

The people's parks and lands are being turned over to private enterprise and the waters and shores are being set up to be fouled by the oil industry.

4329 2018-04-02 15:22:28 @ZeeBusiness #SwatiRaina @tehseenp @PMOIndia Kindly stop playing politics on OIL Prices. 1) Use Methanol/Ethanol & improve SugarCane Price
2) Promote EV's
3) Use Hedging Mechanism
4) Mileage of Cars/Scooters are good. A 10% rise in the fuel price doesn't bring a major change.

All you care about is steel, oil and tech that's been outdated for 40 years. How about supporting real American businesses?
4334 2018-04-02 15:21:58 You are only "willing" to negotiate if the US says negotiate - Otherwise Israel always finds a problem, continues with the illegal occupation and builds on occupied land, stealing water, gas and oil!

4405 2018-04-02 15:14:32 You have properties sitting empty that coal mines or gas and oil industries are buying up that either they let become ransacked falling down or they give it to the state for gamelands so they don't have to pay taxes seems this could be less expensive way
4406 2018-04-02 15:14:31 They voted for low taxes, tax breaks. 
The Oil and Fracking industry pays less tax than teachers and is subsidized by the state.
Its the Republican way.

4438 2018-04-02 15:11:34 For some, not all, rising oil prices don’t help, but inflation’s on a downward curve.

You’re blaming everything on Brexit, but oil prices can be more of a driver than anything. 

Brexit isn’t the only game in the world that effects economies.

And the £ didn’t collapse.

4461 2018-04-02 15:09:02 Just a follow up we are about to submerge all of our miners in mineral oil. Submerging the miners in mineral oil allows the miners to lose heat five times faster than air cooled. Other benefits also reduce noise and we can over clock the miners slightly to increase efficiency.
4462 2018-04-02 15:08:59 May also have a bit to do with Legislatures in multiple states who are given money by Oil Companies making difficult to impossible for Tesla to actually sell cars in those states because it's mandated u have a "dealership" which takes its own convoluted process. Maybe

4474 2018-04-02 15:07:33 Please this is a serious issue,  the international crude oil price is less compared to UPA rule and more costly in BJP rule. For technical terms we can argue, but do you really think middle class understand that, for them petrol is costlier now as compared to UPA

4551 2018-04-02 15:01:42 I would still stick with micellar water tbh, or cold cream maybe...  cold cream is a little more on the oily side, but any specific mascara or eye makeup remover will most likely be oil based and have that similar effect that you don’t like

Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?
4627 2018-04-02 14:53:39 Standard Oil got hit after a lot of illegal behavior involving price fixing and other activities. AT&T got hit for restricting devices that could be connected to their network, blocking competitors, etc. MS has a long history of bad behavior, they didn't get broken up.

4648 2018-04-02 14:51:09 How long does it take for CBD to take effect? CBD chocolate or our high-CBD hemp oil takes longer, from 20 minutes to an hour, depending on how much you ate before and how long ago your last meal was. It is best to take #CBD oil on an empty stomach for faster effect.
4649 2018-04-02 14:50:51 There's literally no reason for PA to avoid a severance tax.

It's not like applying a severance tax is going to reduce the amount of drilling in PA. The oil companies are still gonna want the gas.

4769 2018-04-02 14:39:16 It'd be better for the DRC government to focus on a more manageable fiscal regime. So higher royalty rates do make sense, but the strangely worded windfall profit tax probably doesn't.

4821 2018-04-02 14:33:51 The IPPR report claims that had the UK’s revenues from North Sea oil been invested in a sovereign wealth fund in the 1980s, such a fund would have been worth more than £500bn today......if only
4822 2018-04-02 14:33:47 Independence? More like Norway's oil money and Iceland's self-sufficiency of energy. (Denmark's also ranking well, but still a part of the EU.)
4823 2018-04-02 14:33:45 We have oil but the falling world price of the commodity will make it have very little significance to our economy.

4859 2018-04-02 14:30:06 I haven't heard oil companies say anything about autonomous cars. Also haven't seen anyone promise they will be all electric-it'll come down to battery costs
4860 2018-04-02 14:29:57 You mean smaller companies like the 47% of business that’s done on amazon by 3rd party vendors?
Again, amazon is a marketplace that enables small businesses to grow. Is there a fee? Sure! Why should it be free?
Not quite the same as an oil company.

4862 2018-04-02 14:29:45 This is sure to get some hate but I’m at my car dealer and I noticed they send a female out to show you your bill for oil change etc.   Is that to soften the blow or just so people don’t get pissed off?

4871 2018-04-02 14:29:12 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?

4991 2018-04-02 14:15:12 One of my LEAST favorite phrases, "Car-b-q." Our vehicle caught on fire from spilled oil back in the early 90s. It was terrifying. Luckily, the fire was put out very quickly, but the fumes were nauseating. 

"Vehicle fire" is a good enough description for an event like that. TYVM
4992 2018-04-02 14:15:08 You gotta admit: It’s pretty funny. ARAMCO is just across the bridge. One of the worlds most fastest supercomputers for oil and gas exploration is there, and this discovery was right under their noses this entire time.

4994 2018-04-02 14:15:01 This Oklahoma teachers strike shows the embarrassing level of control the oil lobby has over many red states. Oil execs are pressured the state to not raise taxes to even give teachers a living wage while they rake in record profits. This is shameful #OklaEd #OKleg

5027 2018-04-02 14:10:08 Oklahoma’s future is not oil and natural gas. I don’t know how much clearer to make that. The kids growing up today won’t be able to ‘work in the oildfield’ & make livable wages. Those days are gone. Giving corporate welfare to Oil/Gas in lieu of investing in our future is folly.
5028 2018-04-02 14:10:07 Thinking of buying an old Enduro, a set of old oil skins and just enjoy the mud n shit, Its either that or cry
5029 2018-04-02 14:10:03 Inflation is directly related to petrol/diesel prices. Ask common people if its in control.  In UPA regime crude oil was $115/barrel and petrol prices were Rs. 80 now its $66/barrel and still we are paying same amt for pertrol. Transportation has bcome expensive.

5077 2018-04-02 14:03:41 It also seems to be a theme of people in places like this to think that the "other" thinks in the same f'd up way they do.

5093 2018-04-02 14:02:22 We don’t. But we do subsidize the agricultural, banking, medical, telecoms, steel, and oil industries (to name only a few). You against those as well?
5094 2018-04-02 14:02:20 Do you know the why of our huge oil revenue waste?

Have we fixed those things e.g a weird subsidy regime, recurrent expenditure, currency pegs? Are we asking the right questions? Never mind.

5101 2018-04-02 14:01:43 ...Russia would be a 3rd world nation except for oil and gas reserves.

Meanwhile China is building nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines at a faster rate that the US.

5110 2018-04-02 14:00:56 Nah bruh, I just recognize Peterson's snake oil for what it is.  Like I said, there's nothing new about it, or about your devotion to him.  Hero worship is a common reaction in people who have a hard time coping with reality.
5111 2018-04-02 14:00:52 Teachers walk out, 9:44 AM, Oil executives say the tax hike is too much. But it's still not enough for Oklahoma's teachers, who are staying away from school in protest today.

5115 2018-04-02 14:00:46 I thought we had anti-monopoly laws in this country. I guess they all went away with the break up of Standard Oil. If I want to buy anything on the Internet my searches seem to somehow end up at Amazon or eBay.

5133 2018-04-02 13:57:59 BC depends on oil/gas - they just don't know it - you can't climb mountain passes or supply island communities without gasoline, diesel or propane.  When they test drive a Tesla across the Coquihalla Hwy in a winter storm and live to tell the tale - then I will b/c a believer.
5134 2018-04-02 13:57:29 probably but not with the lifelong artists running studios and “factories” because there was so much grueling work to make the tempura or even with oil the demand to grind out copies of a painting to get maximum money. I bet most of them were desensitized after awhile (not all)
5135 2018-04-02 13:57:00 Kak Mai, kalau guna wet tissue untuk remove sunscreen instead of cleansing oil okay tak?
5136 2018-04-02 13:56:57 It was only 2 days of vacation and I like, got an oil change. And re-potted a plant. It was very exciting.

Still better than some of the intensely stupid ways I wasted my vacation last year.
5137 2018-04-02 13:56:57 I can never take my car in for just an oil change. They always want to tell me I need all 4 tires replaced, every filter replaced, and my engine crusty. BOY IF U DONT CHANGE THIS OIL

5160 2018-04-02 13:53:28 Gas prices at 3 year high.....  

Maybe we'd be better off importing cheaper oil.
5161 2018-04-02 13:53:26 I put so much oil on my third eye I know people at work wonder why I’m so oily all the time

5164 2018-04-02 13:52:37 Note also that the commitments for corporate sponsorship happened in 1979 (when oil at a peak). Corps sponsored with cash & donated employee volunteer time (less likely under present situation)
5165 2018-04-02 13:52:36 Currently the goal of the this administration is to create a kleptocracy. Stealing federal lands for oil, privatized everything. Which is great, if you're a billionaire buddy like devos or prince.

5221 2018-04-02 13:45:20 As Prime Minister, maybe, but his career up until Suez was actually regarded as a success, he resigned at appeasement of Mussolini and was FM throughout the war.
The fear of losing access to oil and Indian trade and his hatred of Nasser led to Suez and resignation.

Standard Oil trust streamlined production and logistics, lowered costs, and undercut competitors.

5247 2018-04-02 13:42:03 Still think for all the oil money they've had to spend winning only 3 league titles and no Champions League's in 10 yrs (they won't win it this year imo) is a poor return for Man City and Sheikh Mansour. Abramovich won more in his first 10 yrs at Chelsea with less money

5251 2018-04-02 13:41:05 @Ford leaking oil pan. Replaced alternator. Invoice says. “ Customer found leak in oil pan”. No! You guys screwed up the drain plug and charged it to Ford as warranty. Wrong!
No more Ford products. No more Atchinson Ford, worst dealership ever!
5252 2018-04-02 13:41:01 Is there any reason why India is not investing in the emerging Guyanese oil and gas sector?
5253 2018-04-02 13:40:58 Speaking out would mean more than not speaking out though. Their silence means agreement. Of course, they could always repeat the actions of 1967 and impose an oil embargo. However, the leaders in that time had a spine more so than the illegitimate leaders you mentioned now.
5254 2018-04-02 13:40:51 Talk of the devil quoting scripture...chidambaram asks a question  he will not have answered in power too RTPChidambaram_IN: Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?
5255 2018-04-02 13:40:32 I don't know about whether oil will be found in commercial quantities in the Chad Basin or not, but I am in complete agreement with your first paragraph. I am very wary when people say publicly or to strangers "I have personal knowledge..." without citing references.

5274 2018-04-02 13:37:50 Sir, all these prices are fairly cheaper compared to what it is now. The global crude oil price at that time was $109/barrel whereas now it is around $50-$60/barrel...but still we are paying same fuel prices as before

He says to me. “Find me some decent techs and it will get done quicker”. 8 Day’s later the car is done. Replaced oil pan.
5288 2018-04-02 13:36:20 2peso increase in oil prices, 2 peso increase in jeepney fares, 2 years of this 2 timing government...are the stars finally aligning?

That @elonmusk scammer is (1) basically running the US space program because we screwed it up, (2) leading the world in renewable/ battery tech, and (3) trying to mass produce an EV for the first time in history.

5520 2018-04-02 13:08:22 Sandberg and Zuck better open a history book and look up "trustbusting" and study how and why Standard Oil for example was broken up in 23 separate entities in 1913.

5523 2018-04-02 13:07:49 Olive oil is a healthy monounsaturated fat. To keep your olive oil fresh, store it in a tinted-glass bottle with an airtight lid and place it in a dark, dry cool cupboard.
5524 2018-04-02 13:07:45 The oil money was well spent on young,talented, versatile players who can switch positions and play different styles. I know it kills u to see us running away with the so-called most competitive league in the  which has at least five title contenders

5526 2018-04-02 13:07:40 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014?

5570 2018-04-02 13:02:15 Should have zero bearing on the price of gas raising in the morning and lowering each evening. Taxes are a separate issue but the price fluctuations are horribly unreasonable. What would happen if oil ever goes back to $100+ a barrel?

5596 2018-04-02 12:58:27 My family, through the generations, starting with WW1, did not fight in 'every war' protecting & defending our country, to have these despicable thieves and cowards sell our country to Big Oil, by parting out our Public Lands, to greedy profiteers & giving our Democracy away!

5624 2018-04-02 12:54:41 Tis the reason for the jump in #gasprices season: still switching to summer gasoline (yeah, it takes far longer than the normal MLB game) coupled with high #oil prices and refinery maintenance. We're in about the 5th inning of the game and hoping there's no extra innings.

5628 2018-04-02 12:53:48 Yes, the state owns the oil industry. That is why Norway has a good social net, because a bigger portion of its GDP goes back to the people instead of into the pocket of some randos.
5629 2018-04-02 12:53:45 Petrol prices were high even when crude oil in internal national market was well below $50 , govt made fortune then, not sure where this money vanished

5654 2018-04-02 12:49:29 Obviously You didn't it get what I meant

The US empire has no legality on squatting in Syria for the oil. Pack up, you're going HOME!

In contrast, oil major #IOC is to step up its solar power portfolio from just 188 MW to only about 260 MW, by 2020. Latter surely can do more.

5788 2018-04-02 12:28:41 Who took out the subsidy on Petrol and diesal ...... if I remember correctly it was a world famous robot economist...... who gave the control of the price to the oil companies.... most probably his masters were getting a commission out of it.

5796 2018-04-02 12:27:15 Exactly. I often think that logic is how essential things like the wheel, oil paints and HP sauce got invented.
5797 2018-04-02 12:27:08 I remember external application of flaxseed oil and meal, and there were a handful of other things that got more than a few positive reports, but I'm forgetting them now, unfortunately. If I remember any, I'll let you know.

5812 2018-04-02 12:24:30 Hot take: weakening fuel economy standards will have a worse effect than nixing the Clean Power Plan. Higher fuel economy means more domestic oil use, which blunts U.S. ability to export oil and mitigate its exposure to oil market volatility (1/2)

Same way use of little mustard oil & olive oil add different flavor to idli

6018 2018-04-02 11:58:35 "Letting U.S. automakers produce cars with inferior mileage performance will lead  consumers to favor countries with tighterstandards — especially since the price of oil is rising again. Eventually, that shift could spell a third round of Detroit bailouts." -- AXIOS GENERATE

6023 2018-04-02 11:57:32 Great question! Oily skin is very oily in the T-zone and on cheeks; pores are enlarged. Normal/Combination is generally oily or normal in the T-zone and normal or slightly dry on the cheeks. Dry skin doesn't have any oil in the T-zone and cheeks are dry and tight.
6024 2018-04-02 11:57:29 .@RochdaleHornets vs @FevRovers for me today at the Crown Oil Arena. Both teams looking to bounce back from Friday’s defeats. Believe Luke Briscoe could break history for the away side too if he scores. #rugbyleague

6027 2018-04-02 11:56:40 Usually recipes use sunflower because it's relatively tasteless. Olive oil has more of a flavour. If your baking flavour will outdo the taste of the olive oil, go for it. Properties won't be an issue, just taste preferences!
6028 2018-04-02 11:56:36 It’s mandatory I get a oil change today!!
6029 2018-04-02 11:56:30 Does anyone else on this planet besides me have greasy eyelids?
Like, your skin produces so much oil that when you squeeze your eyes shut they start to BURN becuz the oil got in? Then you rub 'em and it gets WORSE?

6034 2018-04-02 11:56:00 I'd even go as far as saying that all the pressure on Iran is designed to hold the country back & in servitude. They removed democracy with  Mossadegh. They took opportunity of revolution to start a war from Iraq. Now they've ruined Syria too because it's in Iran's camp. Why? Oil

6227 2018-04-02 11:25:02 It has nothing to do with oil other than keeping the Regime from getting it.
MbS is now touring US with his checkbook to make sure KSA is not abandoned by USA.

6230 2018-04-02 11:24:44 You want to know how much that costs ? The nearest home from you that’s powdered by solar energy isn’t even in the same continent. The ratio of oil & gas being used to solar energy being used is 1:100000 ! It doesn’t make a dent to the amount we’re burning as we speak !

6238 2018-04-02 11:23:14 Russia and Iran are in Syria because the government requested their assistance. They didn’t invade like Turkey, US, Saudi etc. Russia and Iran aren’t occupying only the oil rich areas either.
6239 2018-04-02 11:23:13 Key Things to Know in the Market on Monday:
- Trade spat between U.S. and China continues in high gear
- Global stocks drop over trade worries
- Oil gains support from drop in U.S. production
- Focus on U.S. manufacturing after downbeat data in Asia

6242 2018-04-02 11:22:25 First stop on the day off to do list.....oil change for 7am 
6243 2018-04-02 11:22:25 Plus the article states that *before* the war, annual oil production in Syria was only around 150k barrels. Take that meagre amount away and they become more reliant on Iran, not less.
6244 2018-04-02 11:22:15 I try to, but Imtrained as a scientist and an engineer’s daughter. It’s in my soul to be sceptical, to look for evidence& to try and find solutions based on the possible not snake oil.
6245 2018-04-02 11:21:45 also try some steamy water and karvol or olbas oil in bowl near bed. Great for coughs. Or Vicks on feet xx

6248 2018-04-02 11:21:18 I honestly thought that we were going to wake up to the news of Conte's sacking. It's clearly not the solution. Overhaul of the whole club is needed Asap. Management,board god forbid even ownership. 

 oil money needed like yesterday.
6249 2018-04-02 11:21:15 India has HIGHEST petrol & diesel retail prices among South Asian nations.Taxes account for half of pump rates. FM @arunjetlybjp raised excise 9times between Nov14 &Jan16 to shore up finances as global oil price fell & cut tax just once in Oct 2017 by Rs 2 a litre @PMOIndia

6253 2018-04-02 11:20:46 Its a common Joke in Korea
He doesn't mean that he's gonna sell his oil paper coz he's a superstar and ppl would buy it.
He means he's so oily if he sells oil (expensive cos its is not a natural resource in Korea) he would be rich 
Jimin said  'Jin would be oil-rich' after that
6254 2018-04-02 11:20:26 The quest for oil will kill us all. The US is now occupying the oil rich desert in Syria. So much for fighting ISIS.

6256 2018-04-02 11:20:15 It’s the Tory way. Promise for the cameras, do nothing. Cameron came to Aberdeen & promised to appoint an O&G ambassador to help oil industry then promptly went back to London & forgot all about it when the cameras turned off.
6257 2018-04-02 11:20:12 During UPA crude oil price was 3 times of what is now. So peak petrol price at 82 during UPA was comparatively lower than the now.

As for Chelsea owner, the oil market is no more booming like it use to in Russia 

The owners of Monaco and Chelsea are also best pals (irrelevant)
6264 2018-04-02 11:19:40 big oil was paying 3% tax..plus with the huge tax breaks and subsidies a whole 5% woo hoo..jeez
6265 2018-04-02 11:19:34 Realistically, we're now looking at an oil burner.

6269 2018-04-02 11:19:18 At present, large-scale oil exploration and development in North Korea will lead to an explosive increase in demand for automobiles.
6270 2018-04-02 11:19:11 @975Mornings I’m not a Gabe fan at all. I’ll watch cause it’s a reason to drink beer and to see what mistakes he will make next. I’m going to enjoy every time he slips on the coconut oil.
6271 2018-04-02 11:19:10 I think most expresses got a clear run(dis and home off) and it was only because of a TC failure that the oil train was being held at the next signal,after S&T said that the routine work being done would not affect TCs.This did not go without comment in the report!
6272 2018-04-02 11:19:02 We started that war by invading Syria in the form of extremist proxies. It was all because Assad would not cooperate with Western oil pipelines and monetary control. We do not belong there and have continued our murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people based on lies.

6274 2018-04-02 11:18:59 Me: The 5yo seems busy drawing. I’m going to have a bath.

(Runs hot bath, nice bath oil, face mask applied. Get in.)

5yo: Where are you? (Comes upstairs). Oh, I want a bath. (Gets in). It’s too hot. Let’s put more cold in. And why do you look like a zombie? Let me wash it off.
6275 2018-04-02 11:18:46 Instead of raising taxes on big oil and gas they are raising taxes on people oil and gas production tax will increase five percent, cigarette tax will increase by $1.00, gasoline tax will increase by 3-cents, diesel tax will increase by 6-cents, and lodging tax by $5.
6276 2018-04-02 11:18:41 Let them pay but not with our oil money
6277 2018-04-02 11:18:25 Additionally, I’ve never known a man so ignorant as @realDonaldTrump His only talent?  A snake oil salesman. A con man. 

The only people who follow him are weak and unaware
6278 2018-04-02 11:18:22 Spooks is licking the jar of Marmite. I mean I know I'm veggie but how did I end up with a cat that likes olive oil and Marmite?! Oh, & pastry. No, I do not feed her this stuff before anyone complains - she steals from my plate given the chance. (She actually eats better than me)

6280 2018-04-02 11:18:10 Yup. Even the mammoth solar project is all about addressing the rising domestic consumption. They will not export a single kilowatt hour. Instead, they will free up half a million barrels a day of oil for that; either as crude or into refined products. Doesn’t matter which.
6281 2018-04-02 11:17:40 Oil creeps up towards $70 on lower U.S. Market Rasen, Iran sanctions concern
6282 2018-04-02 11:17:33 Private pike on the look out for anything that will win the love of people with oil paintings of spitfires above the gas fire, he's not subtle the lad.
6283 2018-04-02 11:17:31 Depends. If it's then pinko Chinese, what's the point. If it's one of those religious oil countries, like the united States or Saudi Arabia...
6284 2018-04-02 11:17:30 Nationalise oil companies after that government can sell petrol at much lesser price.
6285 2018-04-02 11:17:29 Very interesting:
. Giga factories are showing up
. Car show reports says: electric cars make the show
..but no "analyst" open a mouth about the "futur" of the oil Co!

(Instead they are "talking" about Tesla & @elonmusk, ..who own already a gigafactory !)
6286 2018-04-02 11:17:10 Low MSP but higher pricing for consumers... Low oil pricing but higher cost of fuel... Squeeze and collect taxes but unemployment is touching sky... Jobs are there but will be given to those who buy leaked papers...lies..cover ups... Go on... Story is long without end..
6287 2018-04-02 11:17:02 Isn't it-how could I forget the 1974 OPEC oil 'crisis'-used to double the price of a barrel of oil overnight-and everything dependent on it,resulting in that least charming of non-Keynesian conditions-Stagflation-high unemployment in harness with high inflation.
6288 2018-04-02 11:16:56 Holland&Barrett sell CBD oil.
I don't know if that would help?
6289 2018-04-02 11:16:53 Liberals actually care what happens to children after they come into this world. Conservatives don't give a fuck about them until they can fight in their wars for oil.

6327 2018-04-02 11:10:28 Reuse: think of you can reuse Hard Density plastic bottles to store oil, detergent, etc.  Reuse allows you to use a product again & again after you've ideally exhausted the actual purpose of the product. So, using a cotton or sac bag to shop continuously is an act of reuse.

6497 2018-04-02 10:43:56 Oil prices suffered a hit to the mid-section last week. A stronger dollar across the board and data released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing that stockpiles rose by more than 1.6 million barrels, weighed on the commodity.

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

6804 2018-04-02 09:54:52 As you may know America has a bee in its bonnet about socialism - they've been militarily and economically attacking Cuba for 60 years now. They can't quite attack Venezuela in the same way - they need the oil - but they're trying their best to bring the government down.

6828 2018-04-02 09:52:11 I don't think it will be realized in a short time. Maybe never for civil use. Lots of problems for example nuclear garbage and nuclear pollution. It seems to me part of propaganda against #Russia to get a lower price of oil

6845 2018-04-02 09:49:10 Heat some dry spices in a skillet. Once aromatic, add oil. Add minced onions. Brown them. Add minced tomatoes. Season it and cook. Add chicken pieces and give 3 whistles in a pressure cooker(if using bone wala chicken. Less if boneless). 
Goes great with rice.
6846 2018-04-02 09:48:56 Amy your a very patient woman. Havin Muslims in the country is the problem. This is down to the Barcelona agreement.

6864 2018-04-02 09:45:06 Snake oil springs to mind. It also unfortunately undermines (in terms of funding available, public perceptions and press coverage) genuinely interesting combinations of those technologies by those more in the know.
6865 2018-04-02 09:45:05 ...and taking money out of the hands of those who need it.  Is this your answer to an. Inbalance of wealth?  The only way to take down the oil companies is to protest the GOVERNMENT to take action,and limit the support towards these oligopolies like OPEC. (2)
6866 2018-04-02 09:44:59 Even if you are being dragged into the cauldron boiling with oil like Daniel,Shadrack, Meshack n Abednego you just humbly enter while clapping!
6867 2018-04-02 09:44:40 It is from GERS. So no it doesn’t exclude oil and gas. That is our GDP. Which is woeful and shows you haw badly this country’s economy has been managed. Even Ireland’s economy without vast natural resources is 40% larger than ours. Imagine that extra wealth every year.
6868 2018-04-02 09:44:29 Another excuse to remain in oil rich Syrian desert. Trump is talking about pulling out, big corporations are thinking of their pockets.

6944 2018-04-02 09:31:34 ADVISORY: Petron will implement the following price increases (VAT incl) effective 6 a.m. tomorrow, April 3: P0.90/li for gasoline, P1.00/li for diesel, and P1.00/li for kerosene. These reflect movements in the international oil market.

6954 2018-04-02 09:29:59 Oh that’s my favorite! Just like when restaurants tell me the pan or oil gets so hot that it destroys all the shellfish cross-contamination.

6958 2018-04-02 09:29:09 It was no mistake. They wanted the oil and strategic territory. Civilians’ only hope for stability is proxy Govt like Egypt where dictator allows Western allies to drain resources for a pittance, dissent violently crushed, Western responsibility deflected.

6971 2018-04-02 09:27:17 Alberta has sold its oil south since days of Leduc because it couldn’t compete in the east with waterborne imports. That is still true today. Surely you don’t expect easterners to pay more for WSB oil than imports? If that was mandated by policy, that would bejust be another NEP?

Thankfully it isn’t to bad. Just a little red..

7049 2018-04-02 09:10:11 Not to forget, in 2014 May, oil PSUs were under a debt of 4 lakh crores. Modi sarkar slowly filled that huge huge hold later when the oil prices fell. Also spending on infra increased, so they did not correspondingly transfer the cheaper prices to people.
7050 2018-04-02 09:10:11 This is assembly and sell in India , not make in India, 100% fdi in retail which modi ji opposed as CM he did U-turn. Crude oil is lowest but still we are paying huge tax for the luxury of politicians and their z security.
7051 2018-04-02 09:09:45 While most are focused just on Crude Oil prices they fail to notice that most other commodities have corrected 10-15% from the top of few months back. Only Oil is not inflation, however expect #RBI and #MPC to focus on that only as usual.

7069 2018-04-02 09:05:20 So, I don't know what your using, but as a mechanic, farmer, and industrial worker, I recommend starting with odorless mineral oil, followed by either "fast orange" or "goop."

Moisturize after, "Aveeno" is good for dryness, "Aquafor" or "O'Keefe's" for cracked fingertips/knucks.

7376 2018-04-02 07:55:13 Give me suggestions of toys to bring to bed! So far I’m thinking a paddle, whipped cream, & oil.

7384 2018-04-02 07:52:01 I haven’t tweeted anything about the square @Sethrogen in awhile. Still bummed you didn’t show for the dance off but I’m digging the beard. Need some beard oil let me know I gots you. Make that man scruff into an enchanted facial forest!

7388 2018-04-02 07:50:51 Petrol is become so expensive even the USA won't invade India for oil.
7389 2018-04-02 07:50:34 Ingt nk grab oil cleanser atau moisturiser dlu. Tapi harga dia boleh tahan tapi grab body shop mahal rasa oke pula. I dont know whyyyyyy. Tapi nasib addict skincare product ja klu makeup sekali mau rabak poket. Hahaha
7390 2018-04-02 07:50:32 This is probably a safety net because SA is going to start trading the petroyuan. Decoupling the dollar and oil trading as being primarily exclusive.
7391 2018-04-02 07:50:21 Currency always fluctuates. The prices of oil always change. You cannot blame the current state on the fall in the GBP because it's not significantly different enough to cause any issue.
7392 2018-04-02 07:50:12 if you can’t get any prescription from a doctor for a good sleeping aid try to put some lavender essential oil on your bed sheets and pillows. it’s a calming scent and helping to sleep  also if it’s only these days maybe astrology has to do something with it? hope you’re okay
7393 2018-04-02 07:50:03 Bio oil ASAP twice a day, it really works
7394 2018-04-02 07:50:00 - pour a drop of olive oil on your fingertip and massage it on your eyebrows. Keep it on for a couple of hours and wash it off with face wash and water. 
- massage almond oil into your eyebrows in circular motions. Keep it over night and wash off in the morning.
7395 2018-04-02 07:49:58 Not really. Solar belongs on rooftops and where it isn't being driven on. This is an inefficient gimmick with a huge cost. Maintenance, power loss from dirt and oil (less with EVs) and shadow are three obvious flaws. The efficiency loss from having to strengthen it will be huge

7398 2018-04-02 07:49:23 Oil is not derived from fossils, nor from decomposing matter. A certain oil Tycoon coined it "the term fossil fuels" in order to induce the idea of scarcity, to ramp up prices not only is oil self replenishing(cabiotic)but in fact, it is the second most prevalent liquid on Earth

7417 2018-04-02 07:45:52 @FionaDecleorUK Hi Fiona sadly I am allergic to the new lavendula iris oil. Will I still be able to get the original iris oil please? X
7418 2018-04-02 07:45:40 Phoning VM is like pouring boiling oil on a broken leg to fix it, so, no, I haven't done that. Your service is so poor I can't even open the link. It's in BS7.
7419 2018-04-02 07:45:35 Same. Domestic oil delivery around Christmas holidays must be the ultimate in surge pricing.

7424 2018-04-02 07:45:21 This is NICE.wen prices increase during MMS tenure...its Cong fault despite the fact crude oil was high. N when crude is on all time low n still the prices are all time high..the BJP govt needs to look for alternative means. Sahi hai boss. MODI JI n BJP can never be at fault.
7425 2018-04-02 07:45:14 ง
7426 2018-04-02 07:45:03 International oil prices are far from all time highs. They are not even close to 2013 highs. It is retail petrol and diesel prices in India that are near all time highs. The problem is nothing to do with luck of the PM and everything to do with his stupidity
7427 2018-04-02 07:44:50 Really good .. my sister in law used to mix black seed oil with milk and drink for soar throat

7444 2018-04-02 07:40:49 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!

7451 2018-04-02 07:39:22 @EPAScottPruitt It is obvious that lowering fuel efficiency standards will take us backwards, not forwards. CA has the 11th largest GDP in the world. When CA talks, the USA listens. Old oil money is about to be extinct. Get used to it. The future is here, and you can't stop it.
7452 2018-04-02 07:38:55 Cui bono? Who benefits when 45 rolls back fuel efficiency requirements for autos?  Hmm?

His pals in oil & gas, that's who!
7453 2018-04-02 07:38:50 I’m too worried about them cooking stuff in the same oil as meat stuff but also worried about them putting something in that isn’t vegan or giving me a meat spring roll by mistake 
7454 2018-04-02 07:38:40 Zimbos and the world were fooled by ED's speeches. Zanu pf's game plan since the coup was always to maintain the status quo while hoping to gain international support. Zanu pf and reform are like oil and water,they don't mix! A leopard will never change its spots.

7462 2018-04-02 07:36:01 Oil firms will raise the price of diesel by P1/L, gasoline by P0.90/L, and kerosene by P1/L effective on Tuesday morning.
7463 2018-04-02 07:35:49 So I was making fried bananas just now and the oil splashed onto my finger WHEN I WAS COOKING THE LAST ONE. How sad.
7464 2018-04-02 07:35:46 @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia  Enough with contributing for so called "Nation building". Oil prices will determine your future in power. Don't want to see the currupt Congress in power but you guys prove that you can't do anything  #FuelPriceHike

7466 2018-04-02 07:35:10 Well for one thing, we know there is no oil on the moon or on the asteroids.

7472 2018-04-02 07:33:55 PBN, it is articles formulated like this, that push people towards the fallacy of adding olive oil and coconut oil to their diets.  We know from studies on monkeys that these processed plant fats also cause CVD. Eat whole plants not isolated mono.sat.fat for god's sake.

7479 2018-04-02 07:33:20 Hell to acche din - give us our bure din back where atleast we had paid high due to soaring crude oil prices and not to fund any loot for election expenses
7480 2018-04-02 07:32:25 Testing the heat of the oil by waving the hand you’ve just had solidly tattooed over it was a whole new level of ridiculous.
7481 2018-04-02 07:31:36 Raisins are better anyway! They're dried naturally while sultanas are dipped in vegetable oil and acid and then dried (thank you Google). It's the same grape. I don't think using the raisins would be a problem. :) Also I made a cherry cake yesterday lol

7493 2018-04-02 07:30:12 But one thing I want to make it clear that you didn't include the global crude oil prices which are the main determining factor of petrol prices which is nearly half of what it used to be in upa era
7494 2018-04-02 07:29:57 Ashe kuwa za ka dade ba ka yi are ba!
7495 2018-04-02 07:29:49 Petrol revenue increased from Rs.99000 cr to Rs.242000 cr in 2016 says statistics. But where did the money go? Govt. is asking oil companies to increase price now.
7496 2018-04-02 07:29:25 I agree with you 100% on that. A couple of pictures of the guy, often in uniform, a picture with a kid, and a car or house. And their all widowers who either are military or work in the oil industry.
7497 2018-04-02 07:29:19 setau saya oil based cleanser ga akan bikin muka kalian tambah oily kok, kenapa? karena setelahnya kalian bakal cuci muka lagi pake sabun cuci muka biasa  jadi semua oil nya bakalan larut bareng sabun cuci muka kamuu
7498 2018-04-02 07:29:15 Makeup remover wipes never worked well with my skin but now that I use straight coconut oil I realize the wipes didn't even remove makeup quick or smoothly!

7519 2018-04-02 07:22:51 Not really. Peak oil is an economic fallacy.
7520 2018-04-02 07:22:40 Hahaha U.S. and control of oil goes together like Ernie and Bert, check the weapons in the hands of ISIS .made in the good old USA. Turkey is protecting its borders where attacks have caused 1000s of deaths in TR. You're just trying to stop migrants! If the Mexicans used weapons?
7521 2018-04-02 07:22:32 I suppose if you can figure out a way not to deep fry them in oil. Maybe bake them with a little bit olive oil(?) instead and lightly seasoned.
7522 2018-04-02 07:22:20 Oil prices rose on Monday, lifted by a drop in drilling activity in the United States as well as by expectations that Washington could re-introduce sanctions against Iran.

7530 2018-04-02 07:21:05 @sapinker Also strange that we can distribute 99 million barrels of oil a day and 10 billions tons of coal a year, but building solar and wind is an “impossible” task, although wind alone supplies more than 12% of electricity in Europe right now!

7666 2018-04-02 06:52:29 @ShopMedMen what's your return policy? because you sold me some CBD oil that literally doesn't do anything no matter how much I take. I haven't used CBD for 5mo prior, so I doubt it has anything to do with tolerance.
7667 2018-04-02 06:52:16 Global crude oil price is  $65-70 /barrel & we r forced 2pay prices of 2008-2014 wen crude oil price was $140-100. Highest petrol price in Chennai was Rs 79.55 during 2013 wen crude oil was at its peak. Now oil companies r looting our hard earned money fr NO reason @dpradhanbjp

And who created ONGC ?

Both are ok with:

Bank bailouts
Unending wars
Tax cuts for rich
Deregulation
Corporate/SuperPacs
Oil pipelines/fracking
Surveillance/spying
Private health ins
Cutting SS (BHO tried cutting SS in 2011)

That’s off the top of my head

7963 2018-04-02 05:52:38 Here in Connecticut we have no oil wells.   

Is your state still littered with tens of thousands of fossil-fuel oil wells, Jerry?

It sure is.  @JerryBrownGov , tell the truth.

even tho Standard Oil had 10,000 oil rigs in Venezuela in 1934.
Explain how a "Socialist Country" gives up its national resources
for pennies on the dollar? The political instability is a product of design.
7967 2018-04-02 05:51:44 Greed lead the invasion. The WMD were a lie. Saddam was compliant in all requests from the US, and we rewarded him by destroying his country, leaving his people at the mercy of extremists and taking over the resources, oil fields and poppy fields for ourselves. It is a sad state.
7968 2018-04-02 05:51:43 You're missing (1) oil workers bussed in to serve bbq & tell everyone funding schools will shut down the state (2) someone saying "you don't have to work in the summer, whiners!"

8087 2018-04-02 05:28:44 During the UPA rule , crude oil price was 120 Dollar per barrel. Now it is not even half. But still Petrol & Diesel prices reached the peak when compared to last 10 years @narendramodi 
On the other hand @AmitShah is busy in making false promises in Karnataka for coming election
8088 2018-04-02 05:27:52 When it's not oil
8089 2018-04-02 05:27:51 It's high time GOI looked into oil prices  it is definitely high very high.
8090 2018-04-02 05:27:23 OMG SIS!!! we in the same boat! i can’t get these mfs off (i’ve tried coconut oil & NOTHING)
8091 2018-04-02 05:27:15 It depends on if you get oil or powdered based. Oil eye liner works better for me; it looks fine and doesn’t take TOO much effort to get off
8092 2018-04-02 05:27:12 Because of our stupid, and pointless, trade war with China there are now a ton of items more expensive cause China put tariffs on these specific items:

Nuts
Avocados
Oranges
Lemons
Limes
Apples
Pears
Cherries
Berries
Wine
Ethanol
Oil
Pork
8093 2018-04-02 05:27:07 Aren’t you more concerned with China initiating payments for oil in yuan instead of US$ or the tariffs they’re imposing and how we can counter them
or the forecasts for the 2Q w/more movement towards gold these will affect our economy more than Mexico

8201 2018-04-02 05:04:33 Even though crude oil rates are lower than earlier why the hell fuel rates increased like this. Govt should keep an eye on this first. Fuel rates will effect most of the markets in the country. Who is going to be responsible for this @PMOIndia @arunjaitley ?
8202 2018-04-02 05:04:20 Their influence is small relative to others, their more interested in controlling the supply, remember they have refineries in Kansas that need that oil., cheap oil, a steady supply

8241 2018-04-02 04:56:13 The environmental consulting industry employs tens of thousands of engineers and geologists. It’s all funded by big oil companies to clean up polluted sites. So in that way, I am funded almost exclusively by Exxon.
8242 2018-04-02 04:56:09 Obama is an imperialist but with a nice smile.Trump is an imperialist but he's openly imperialist. At least Trump is being honest , for example Trump openly said we need to "take the oil"

8245 2018-04-02 04:55:48 @namo_office Government should realise a few things happening in our country.
Sc/St people are being alienated in all the spheres of life. Some are from PSU's like oil companies are terminated even after serving 25 years in the organization for a flimsy reasons.
8246 2018-04-02 04:55:42 If the conservatives talk Pipelines to Tide water,  the Kochs will give more money to Sierra and Tides to fight it and elect a different govt. So will Warren Buffet- however Buffet wants no Pipelines AT ALL so he can keep making billions hauling oil in his trains. Makes sense?

4.Allowing beastiality as long as no penetration
5.Carbon Tax
6.Tanker moratorium on west coat that stop int’l movement of LNG and oil
8253 2018-04-02 04:54:02 I think it’s cool as long as every time you do anything involving the oils you say “oil yeah, baby” or “oil, Suzy!”

8255 2018-04-02 04:53:10 Or if you check gas prices, a carbon tax price difference is like Friday.

8277 2018-04-02 04:48:55 I have pipelines on my mind, I guess! I'm in Alberta & BC is trying to block a much needed pipeline to the coast. Instead of importing oil from countries w/no environmental standards, we need to use our own & keep improving our environmental standards.

8290 2018-04-02 04:46:22 Chef Kawasaki cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with cheese.
8291 2018-04-02 04:45:43 tweekster is false they have nothing to do with free speech, only #censorship and promotion of a false #globalist narrative. you can not mix oil and water.
8292 2018-04-02 04:45:39 brush your teeth

8293 2018-04-02 04:44:56 It depends on your skin type tbh. I’m super oily. I make my base matte AF even with acne but if I do a dewy look it makes my acne worse bc of all the oil build up slipping around.
8294 2018-04-02 04:44:55 Seriously wish they would get locked up until the oil is flowing thru the new line. Won’t happen. But nice to think about.

8297 2018-04-02 04:44:15 Indeed a game changer and a huge risk for USA who mints dollars.
I could be wrong, but I thought major oil producer Saudi Arabia can only value and sell oil in USD because of an agreement signed during Nixon presidency?
8298 2018-04-02 04:44:09 The wife bought some Talenti ice cream at Walgreens, and the next day I'm seeing Talenti ads on Twitter.

Big brother is watching.  And apparently he really wants us to eat ice cream.
8299 2018-04-02 04:43:59 Trump’s election victory was orchestrated by big oil so they could slowly re-raise gas prices and we’d all be too distracted to cause a huff—-I’m willing to discuss my new theory on Joe Rogan’s podcast any time.
8300 2018-04-02 04:43:34 The Psy Spa in San Leandro was . 80 minutes of brutal scrubbing ALL OVER (all over, seriously), most of my skin sloughed onto the table in ribbons. Buckets of hot water, so much oil, absolute heaven.

8310 2018-04-02 04:40:59 Solar & wind have limited capacity in certain climates & drawbacks of their own. Nothing wrong w/diversification, but at a realistic pace. Like it or not, the world is still dependent on oil. Better to keep improving environmental responsibility than to block pipelines altogether
8311 2018-04-02 04:40:38 Get lost wt your stupid language. BTW,the petrol prices are depends on crude oil prices first know where it is increasing. People need the developement without paying anything. Even after paying the money goes to your favourite corrupting leaders What the stupid system built-in

McLellan gets short leash in 18-19, if they stumble, he’s gone in-season. Miss playoffs = both gone. Playoffs or bust.

8345 2018-04-02 04:34:30 @geography_411 .In recent years of Russia oil prices have drastically fallen it’s an extreme blow to the economy.
8346 2018-04-02 04:34:24 I think we need a free market push towards alternatives, which is happening to an extent, but right now what we need MOST is energy independence to shake the NWO off our backs. Unfortunately, technology has not reached the point where we can be independent of both coal and oil.

8358 2018-04-02 04:31:59 @realDonaldTrump Molten Salt Reactors, Heat, Static, Hydro, Solar...anything is better than oil. Make jobs in those areas instead and you will gain the support of most of your people. Be the President that is needed.

8523 2018-04-02 04:01:40 Turmeric, CBD (capsules or edibles, and there's also lotion and oil), and paraffin wax applied hot where it's bad - brings relief like nothing else. (Just test a bit to make sure your skin doesn't go mad.) 
8524 2018-04-02 04:01:40 Soak cashews in water for 24 hours. Process till smooth like peanut butter add some coconut oil and a pinch of salt. I use it for a cream cheese substitute.

8534 2018-04-02 04:00:47 Budget increases asked for but not approved = savings? Don't think so. User-fee increases = savings? Don't think so. Drawing on reserves = savings? Don't think so. Spending less on diesel for buses because of lower oil prices = an accidental saving.

8545 2018-04-02 03:59:23 What could be wrong with me announcing an upcoming date to do a proposed Facebook Live broadcast about CBD oil? I just tried to post that idea, but Facebook stopped me dead in my tracks.

8556 2018-04-02 03:57:19 China pays for imported crude oil in yuan instead of US dollars.. Gadkari's initiation of highway construction debentures in MASALA BOND is appreciable, but the private firms listed in NASDAQ &NIKKEI also hv to do this, . This will improve rupees liquidity in global market.

8582 2018-04-02 03:53:34 I do agree the leash is shorter for McLellan, and with a slow start he would be the 1st to go (even in season). That said, Chiarelli’s going to have to pull a rabbit out of a hat to save his job heading into next season though.
8583 2018-04-02 03:53:22 Is Indian economy  depending too much on Oil revenue or is it the "ani s" alone are deciding our fate?????

In both cases, it is undoubtedly the failure of Ministry of Finance to generate revenue from other means.

Hope you can understand the" anis"

8585 2018-04-02 03:53:12 It’s not the fuel tax that raises prices it’s the oil industry greed. 1.5 cents tax means over .50 cents a litre increase?  BC is being gouged.

8587 2018-04-02 03:52:48 Sir where our money has been going since 3.5 years. While other south Asian countries have shown sufficient amount of decrease in costs of petrol and diesel because International crude oil prices are at its low cost. While India has been charging 10 to 15 rupees extra from public

8664 2018-04-02 03:40:56 @BalzerGrandma hi gramz!
Happy you are on twitter.

Things to watch this week is to see if DXY (the dollar) will reverse it's downtrend and head back up causing gold and oil to fall (for sure gold down)

Also keep your eye on VIX.  If it stays above 18 while stocks rally,

8674 2018-04-02 03:39:24 Last week, our colleague visited Nigeria for more business cooperation with local businessman in the fields of oil processing and pellet making. It was a wonderful trip for local people.
8675 2018-04-02 03:39:14 Petrol at 4yr high, diesel touched an all time high. 

Mr Jatlie had raised excise duty 9 times between 2014 and 2016, as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once on 2017.

8691 2018-04-02 03:36:25 It appears the model man who supply crude may be allowed to Côte higher price so that the oil company's get pacunary benefit shared by Politecians. This will be exposed once the Government not in power my be after 2019 election. Otherwise all are honest.

8717 2018-04-02 03:30:47 My holy grail is rosehip oil, if you have pigmentation or scars it will leave your skin so smooth, one day I cut my pinky cutting veggies & I put the oil and the next day the wound was closed. I would use the oil maybe once a week or whenever I feel that my skin needs some glow
8718 2018-04-02 03:30:39 Been waiting for 30 years - nkt a SINGLE ONE of the AGW cultists came true.

8723 2018-04-02 03:29:56 Ok once and for all, price is high because of world oil price. It has nothing to do with who is in power at Center, the price in Vancouver Canada today in $ 1.45, which = about 90 RS and Canada is a oil producing country!

Just lather up in coconut oil and BAM now they're whipped
8730 2018-04-02 03:28:40 Remember the #Kochs were already well off when their ancestors immigrated here. Not one of them has had to struggle. Note in book how Charles orchestrated the theft of oil from tribal lands. Rich ppl are the biggest thieves. #Irony

8752 2018-04-02 03:24:31 I agree they haven’t had direct face to face, on the other hand I look also from economic perspective. Particularly, oil industry depends on their oil drilling. Prices on fuels must be staying low.

8833 2018-04-02 03:08:56 That’s a deceptive graph. Doesn’t account for capex/lease spend to drill wells currently operating or continuous need to drill aggressively to maintain production (more capex). No, oil companies are generally not profiting $20+ $/bbl at $60 WTI. CFFO vs. Net Cashflow

8835 2018-04-02 03:08:46 Brilliant.  Looks like the oil discovery brought out the misogynist in some men in power.

8840 2018-04-02 03:08:03 Flour
Keep whole wheat flour chilled. High oil levels in the wheat germ can  make this baking staple go rancid if kept in the pantry too long. If you use it infrequently, store in an airtight container in the fridge, where it can last two to six months.

8847 2018-04-02 03:06:35 Just another distraction by Trump to keep the nation worried about China and our economic problems (he is creating) rather than focus on him and the mess he is making for us, while he makes a paradise for the super rich.

Remember Saddam Hussein? He burned his own oil fields.

8860 2018-04-02 03:05:19 Before #Trump is done he's going to try to privatize the US military by selling it to Erik Prince's latest venture.  Can't wait until he sells the sponsorship of America: Welcome to the United States of America, brought to you by Rosneft, Russia's top oil producer.

8899 2018-04-02 03:00:31 The Koch Brothers had a father, ... who taught the Soviet Bloc to drill for oil. These kids from Kansas were the spawn of a man that was a Globalist of the most perverse sort. Ain't they a hoot?

8930 2018-04-02 02:55:50 Okay but in JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, Judas gets thirty pieces of silver to betray Jesus while accusing Mary of using oil on Jesus's feet that cost three HUNDRED silver pieces. So did he sell out Jesus for almost nothing or was Mary's foot oil actually insanely luxe?

8945 2018-04-02 02:53:19 My skin is pretty shitty at the moment but I use Aloe Vera, Tea Tree oil, and then some actual products by like Neutrogena. But I typically don’t follow an actual routine and that’s why my skin tends to vary in it being clear of acne/dark spots.

8949 2018-04-02 02:52:52 I’m w Rob on this one. I think both McLellan & Chiarelli will get a vote of confidence, one more kick at the can (whether fans like it or not) to right the ship. David I know you’re hoping for Quenneville, that situation in CHI could go either way. I’m leaning that he stays tho.
8950 2018-04-02 02:52:40 What if the husband happens to be a victim?
8951 2018-04-02 02:52:30 Not for money. Not for oil!
8952 2018-04-02 02:52:23 U are. Try baby oil at night. Theirs even baby oil body wash by Johnson and Johnson. It helps a lot. It gives u're skin more hydration. Plus Vaseline lotion helps too. They even have a spray on kind now. I know that's what she said...
8953 2018-04-02 02:52:12 Better than the time my sister discovered her nephew raturously watching a gallon of vegetable oil spread over her floor as he poured it out.
8954 2018-04-02 02:51:59 Anyone from Jamaica wanna hook me up with some castor oil?
8955 2018-04-02 02:51:51 Ahhh, you must be one of the aforementioned 26. Tell me, before the oil money, what team did you support?
8956 2018-04-02 02:51:36 so, I guess you don't want to hear about us in the DFW area laying out the backyard covered with baby oil a few days ago, sipping on ice tea.

8959 2018-04-02 02:50:48 BJP government ne diesel petrol ka rate badhakar 6 lakh crore kamaya.

Jabki es government k time me crude oil sasta hai
8960 2018-04-02 02:50:41 Not all vegans get enough protein or enough fiber -- but all whole food plant based no oil dieters do. The point is protein fixation and fiber avoidance are meat industry narratives. @vegan is a meat industry shill hawking fake meat for a processed food company.
8961 2018-04-02 02:50:27 Got it. Seems unfair.  What baffles me in SA is the monuments for the Dutch who stole land, diamonds, oil, etc. .  I’ve seen locals and tourists taking pictures with them.  Time to remove that shit.  
8962 2018-04-02 02:50:21 Omg that’s the one I need I’m a oil silk, do you prime & set ????
8963 2018-04-02 02:50:03 april glow up challenge  drink as much water as you can, oil your skin every night, take junk food out your diet, cut off toxic people, stop wasting money on unnecessary items, hit the gym honey, stick to that skincare routine and continue to spread positive 
8964 2018-04-02 02:49:28 I need an oil change and I don’t have time until the weekend after next.
8965 2018-04-02 02:49:28 Afterwards, a dark cool room, peppermint oil behind your ears and on your temples, and an ice pack on your head will help loosen the tension. You don’t have to sleep, just rest.

8971 2018-04-02 02:48:41 Lavender really helps with my anxiety. I use this soap when I take my bath at night & oil for my diffuser. It helps so much.
8972 2018-04-02 02:48:26 Finally picked up Sonic Mania recently and... I can see why people hate the Oil Ocean boss.

Oh! U were not allowed to leave with them in 2015? Hahaha

8976 2018-04-02 02:47:39 Why? Are there oil leases you'd like to sell there?

8982 2018-04-02 02:46:29 McLellan seems like such a deeply loyal guy. If the cuts include Woodcroft who McLellan has been together with since the Red Wings days. I am not so sure he does not say screw it I am out too if Jay goes. You can bring another PP coach in but Jay stays I could see him doing that.
8983 2018-04-02 02:46:28 I must say it’s a rookie mistake to use oil without a nice tan before
8984 2018-04-02 02:45:48 More important is who is accepting yuan for oil?
8985 2018-04-02 02:45:42 My dinner turned out quite good, with enough left for tomorrow. I added Olive oil, turmeric, black pepper, kubabas, and a bay leave....

8988 2018-04-02 02:45:29 In this Rohingya issue, @UN is breeding refugees as their cash cow but pretends as they care. Pumping in $ cash money by abusing Myanmar in most notorious way. Talking about oil, 4409 is correct. As gas from Myanmar go to China, US is destructing as part of its Asia pivot policy.

8990 2018-04-02 02:45:17 They just paid a coach 75 million,so I don't think A&M needs the money from the SEC-they got plenty of money and always will long as oil is flowing through the city of Houston!
8991 2018-04-02 02:45:07 Please do! And report back on why it's impossible to find an unsweetened non-dairy coffee creamer that's not some kind of powdered edible oil product.
8992 2018-04-02 02:45:01 voting on the mexican treatment suggested for the others but the broccoli, onion, potatoes and peppers would be great roasted together (add garlic, lemon -  jalapeno and the tomatoes even?) 400°, oil, herbs (paprika!) and then use that for the ricotta pasta sauce. Good stuff
8993 2018-04-02 02:45:01 3 pieces of quick advice for the oil

1) Store away from light
2) Store away from a heat source
3) Heat limit is 385, then it smokes and loses flavor and health benefits

hope you enjoy! those two make a fantastic bread dipper! The oil is good for all sorts of cooking too!
8994 2018-04-02 02:44:44 Same dude! You prob already have olive oil in your house — try that!! I just did for the first time today and I didn’t know my hair could be this soft

9019 2018-04-02 02:40:40 You are right, it comes from fossil fuels but not oil! 5% world #electricity is generated by oil which means shifting to #electricalcars will decrease oil demand.  Now the world electricity comes from the following sources: 
Coal 39%
Gas 22%
Hydro 17%
Nuclear 11%
Oil 5%
Others 7%

    GAIL (India) remains preferred gas play.
9067 2018-04-02 02:32:16 In fact the linked article is very professional and objective (), by just stating what really happened. 'Russian oil refinery' was not mentioned at all, because this was not caused by them, but by completely different company ... U think little Russophobic hype helps?

9156 2018-04-02 02:18:42 Isn't it ironic that it's the Libtards who don't recognize Putin as the enemy while Trump is increasing pressure on them in a leveraged way. Watch what happens when we replace Russia as a supplier of petroleum to European countries. Russia's economy has a single source: Oil.

9161 2018-04-02 02:18:12 Is hot cooking oil sizzling on a pan and burning the fuck out of you with its vapors a valid phobia?
9162 2018-04-02 02:18:12 I hate when I say I’m interested in skincare and the person doesn’t even ask me about my routine/favorite products and then just immediately suggest things that break me out like coconut oil and apple cider vinegar

9184 2018-04-02 02:15:27 OMG! Because raw sewage is being spewed into Canada's river and oceans, no one should do a thing about pollution and GHG emissions from the oil sands. Like that makes sense.
9185 2018-04-02 02:15:22 And now @sagarikaghose leave Rahul Gandhi for some days and start scratching Lalu Yadav’s ass.. in between rajdeep must be buying oil to bend it like ghodi for lalu..

9202 2018-04-02 02:12:59 Just think about that, a profession that dresses people in ridiculous costumes, the men cover themselves in body oil, and portray characters that even superhero writers find odd, has more fucking responsibility to their athletes than the NFL.

9236 2018-04-02 02:07:54 A prime example was yesterdays analysis on OIL. Despite of institutions having heavg net long positions and almost a 10th of shorts..u still had a slight bias towards a long trade. Yet you are patient. Thats what experience does! Thats why you are COT FATHER

9245 2018-04-02 02:06:08 Here are some storage tricks to make your Foods last Longer!

Olive oil
Stick to small bottles unless you're heavy-handed. Once opened, olive oil can go rancid in as little as three months (even though the bottle might say it will last longer).
9246 2018-04-02 02:05:54 As long as it's a brown or yellow onion, sautéed properly with oil with dash of soy sauce so it carriers over that yumminess
9247 2018-04-02 02:05:43 This is you. A club bought leagues success by spending billions and still failed in Europe. Just enjoy while oil last.
9248 2018-04-02 02:05:12 Justin Welby was an oil executive before he decided to pursue his calling in the Church. I think if his motivation in life was money, rather than Jesus, then he made a bad career move.
Say what you like about the Anglican Church but I do believe that JW’s faith is wholly genuine.
9249 2018-04-02 02:05:08 Nope. But some effects are allergic like if you but peanut oil in the vaccince at birth, the body will violently react to peanuts it's whole life. That shows they are bad for the body.
9250 2018-04-02 02:05:06 We went with lobster and a basil salad. I used the shells to make a lobster infused olive oil.
9251 2018-04-02 02:04:57 We love our oil money hopefully we get some more 
9252 2018-04-02 02:04:56 Thanks to my toddler I'm covered in vaseline and lavender oil but...uh, not hating it
9253 2018-04-02 02:04:55 I put oil or butter, herbs, cloves of garlic S&P whatever you like I think the butter or oil more for flavor. After its done, you have to pat dry and brown.  I even done hamburgers.  No more fights with the hubby that's it over done, we finished in BQ!
9254 2018-04-02 02:04:51 I need olive oil, fresh green beans, whitening fish, sugar, syrup and a lemon

9262 2018-04-02 02:04:05 Holidays have been overwhelming lately, so today after the kids found their baskets we headed to #Galveston #beach to chill out. Other than the spots of oil? Tar? and dead fish, it was fun. #HappyEaster2018

9309 2018-04-02 01:55:14 Pipelines don't emit any emissions.   So you are protesting the pipeline to have the oil shipped to the coast by train.   KinderMorgan doesn't produce oil.  If people want to stop the flow get up to fort mac and protest there that would make more sense.

9320 2018-04-02 01:54:14 That perspective is quite off Centre. The Koch's like many other activist billionaires like the Rockefellers support these groups to help box the Oil Sands out of international markets where it can fetch more money.  Highly orchestrated.

9378 2018-04-02 01:42:37 Frying up the perfect flap jack takes:
1) a good batter
2) the right oil
3) patience
4) understanding the optimal amount of batter per pancake.

9388 2018-04-02 01:41:24 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
9389 2018-04-02 01:41:19 finalmente criei coragem e comprei o protetor solar e o cleansing oil que to precisando ha um ano agora so falta a passagem pra recife
9390 2018-04-02 01:41:18 In Nov-13, PBOC announced it would no longer stockpile FX reserves.  In plain English, this meant from then on, they would immediately exchange any USD's in trade into "other assets" - equities, gold, real estate, oil fields, etc.  IOW, "ABT" = Anything But Treasuries
9391 2018-04-02 01:41:14 They only withdrew application because Justin added more requirements that he didn't require for other projects. Liberals killed Energy East. Atlantic Canada would happily welcome AB oil and create jobs in the region.
9392 2018-04-02 01:41:13 I recently heard the the average Ontario govt worker has a $400,000 pension on retirement, ask what an oil workers pension looks like.
9393 2018-04-02 01:41:09 I see y'all stop crying about that Snapchat update
9394 2018-04-02 01:40:48 Interest Rates are Still Very Low. As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—The Dollar & Bond Yields will Also—As Bond Prices & Commodities ( Gold, Oil, Corn Etc.) Fall.  Just a Matter Of Time.  #EconomicCycle

9396 2018-04-02 01:40:26 i was heavy with some regular castor oil for a good while then i chilled and was basically wearing my natural hair that was when i had my twist outs for like a month
9397 2018-04-02 01:40:21 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
9398 2018-04-02 01:40:15 Damn John is glistening. Is that a mix of sweat and baby oil? I don't want any smoke @chrissyteigen it's just an observation #JesusChristSuperstarLive
9399 2018-04-02 01:40:05 I heard The Cure's "Just Like Heaven" on the car dealership's PA system the last time I got an oil change.
9400 2018-04-02 01:40:02 So I got shampoo and rosemary essential oil in my eye while showering. I’m probably gonna lose my eyesight but atleast I have more little hairs growing from my head
9401 2018-04-02 01:39:59 China may well buy oil in Yuan but will oil providers stay in Yuan or buy something else?

9404 2018-04-02 01:39:46 @DeanHeller @RosenforNevada 
Russian sanctions for espionage
Dean Heller voted to sanction Russian Oil, Banks, criminals, & spies
What happened Dean?
You know that Comrade President will be indicted for money laundering, obstruction of justice & treason
Support Russian sanctions
9405 2018-04-02 01:39:39 there is no answer from any govt for this,its global problem,oil is natural resource which is getting consume  fast & india having too much vehicle,requirement is huge,this will keep increasing by passing years, only option is reduce consumption or switch to alternate source "EV"

9407 2018-04-02 01:39:03 After selling us out #PresidentChump, a.k.a. @realDonaldTrump, tries to recover his base by saying that there will now be no deal with #DACA. Personally, I’m not not buying any more of your snake oil. #TrumpSellOut #TrumpTheLiar #TrumpTheWeasel
9408 2018-04-02 01:38:57 Why you stupid #GodiMedia playing games 
Modi got control in #ECI #CBI #RBI #CJI #ED #Media  he don't have control in oil  prices    you mean #Ambani control oil  prices 
All Indians knows international Crude Oil  prices and it's processing charges including tax
9409 2018-04-02 01:38:35 That could actually be because you wash it everyday. It's drying your scalp out, forcing it to produce more oils. Less washing = healthier scalp = less oil produced. It takes a bit to get it to stop looking so gross, but it really does make a difference.
9410 2018-04-02 01:38:17 CBD oil does not contain THC, so should be a problem for nurses. Plus, please fight to have to double standard for doctors changed, it’s outrageous that a nurse can lose their license for something a doctor cannot!
9411 2018-04-02 01:38:05 my The Ordinary order is never gonna ship i'll never get my rosehip seed oil...
9412 2018-04-02 01:37:59 Nothing says Yankees have to maintain that courtesy. Salient point being, it is a COURTESY. If one isn't a citizen, s/he is not in a position to dictate what a country can and can't do w/its assets, such as water, oil, lumber, real estate, labour laws, broadcasting standards, etc
9413 2018-04-02 01:37:58 The Allies won WW2, and the Axis lost it.  To take it down to country level is absurd reductionism.  If the flight school at Habbaniya in 1943 had lost the oil fields in Iraq, the war would have been lost.  And there were countless examples like that.
9414 2018-04-02 01:37:53 Tea tree oil is really helping with the dark spots on my face, Trader Joe’s have some bomb facial products low key.

9418 2018-04-02 01:37:20 I was gonna say I put too much coconut oil in my bath, but there’s no such thing as too much coconut oil.
9419 2018-04-02 01:37:05 A6: Our teachers are better than average. Our funding is worse than average. And teachers are finished being second best to oil and gas and tourism. You won’t shut our mouths. It’s up to you how long it takes to make us as competitive in every area—before you lose what you have.
9420 2018-04-02 01:36:52 Then the oil lobby will get it off the air
9421 2018-04-02 01:36:44 a rat got in the cooking oil bottle this morning.

9424 2018-04-02 01:35:55 you ever thought about jumping into a boiling hot oil fryer bc me too
9425 2018-04-02 01:35:53 Taylor Hall...MVP!!!
9426 2018-04-02 01:35:46 If you’re ever in #Phoenix #Arizona you’ve got to visit the fantastic @QCOliveMill  A must see .The  food is fantastic , the products are great and you’ve got to buy the award winning Extra virgin olive oil ..
9427 2018-04-02 01:35:42 After a hole life making a name and a career in Oil industry, Rex-T went down bigly just for being associated with DT (just like everyone around him). SAD.
9428 2018-04-02 01:35:28 TransCanada withdrew the application. Can't approve a withdrawn application. With KXL approved, they don't need Energy East. Albertans forget that QC and the maritimes are not dependent on AB oil - having Hydro and Hibernia, and ports for foreign tankers.
9429 2018-04-02 01:35:27 Hey Negan, will you check to see where that oil leak is coming from while you're done there.  #TWD @hardwick @JDMorgan @TheWalkingDead
9430 2018-04-02 01:34:58 Rosehip seed oil from the ordinary is where I started. It's amazinggggg
9431 2018-04-02 01:34:46 I don’t know any routines... but Indian healing clay  a miracle worker. For detox, whole body or face, clay baths, insect bites, blackheads, acne, oil, clogged pores, etc etc
9432 2018-04-02 01:34:38 Don’t be distracted and thirsty. I almost swallowed castor oil 
9433 2018-04-02 01:34:24 Being afraid of the hot comb is how I ended up begging my mama for my first relaxer. Bc fuckkkk that. And then the pressing grease/oil used to heat up and melt down to sizzle ya scalp? Bruhhhhh.
9434 2018-04-02 01:34:07 Where’s my oil?
9435 2018-04-02 01:34:00 #TheWalkingDead Kids & Carol just do mix well.....oil & water!! 
9436 2018-04-02 01:33:51 In 1973 the Arab oil producers held the world hostage by embargo. This caused massive lines at supermarket to get basics, energy use cuts, protests & changed Japanese foreign policy for decades to come.
9437 2018-04-02 01:33:39 When I went to church a 8 year old little girl took out a essential oil from inside her little purse. She opened it and started waving it around her face to smell it then put it back in her purse. WTF IS UP WITH THESE KIDS. I HAD TAMAGACHIS IN MY PURSE WHEN I WAS 8!!!
9438 2018-04-02 01:33:36 I’m taking flax seed omega 3 oil, prenatal with literally every health factor the baby needs, spirulina for my digestion, and a probiotic to balance my ph. Lmao this baby better come out a super hero or some shit

9444 2018-04-02 01:32:19 Ur girls out w some random that begged her to scoop so she could get free dunkin
I’m home rubbing coconut oil on all my household appliances and googling how to do black magic
9445 2018-04-02 01:32:19 LoL , I think car oil.
9446 2018-04-02 01:31:42 Yep. Love it. I hate all the oil. I often make it at home instead  oily food is just too much

9449 2018-04-02 01:31:27 A6) We need to send the message that our kids are worth more. Education funding needs to be priority one! Oil could afford a 7% GPT, the gas taxes are still low, hotels will not lose business if they know how to structure the fees within their costs. More can be done! #oklaed
9450 2018-04-02 01:31:19 Mme gone. Why would you buy the tuna ya vegetable oil?

No man. Nooo
9451 2018-04-02 01:31:18 A6: It’s time for #okleg to bring in big businesses that aren’t oil and gas related. Time to let the oil and gas industry know that they don’t own them. It’s time for those men and women to understand that teachers are becoming “woke”. #oklaed

9456 2018-04-02 01:31:04 Better than an idiot who said in the 70s we were running out of oil, I remember watching you say that and thinking, dang what are we going to do?  I was 12 at the time.
9457 2018-04-02 01:31:04 A few weeks ago my guy-pal gave some home-made chili oil to our neighbours who own the store across the street and today they rang our doorbell and gave us a pork-chop. I love it here in this pocket of the world.
9458 2018-04-02 01:31:00 You haven’t seen my beard lately b I got the castor oil on my shit
9459 2018-04-02 01:30:59 kalo mau gampang nyerep coba kamu campur oilnya sama moist kamu. Kaya gue kalo pagi selalu campur aloe gel+1-2 tetes oil biar dia gampang nyerap
9460 2018-04-02 01:30:55 From a fiction perspective, I've always found Nigerian fiction to grapple so well with identity in a colonial society. Books like "Nervous Conditions", "Joys of Motherhood" and "Oil on Water" do so well to articulate the cruel irony of telling your own story in a forced language.
9461 2018-04-02 01:30:39 thank >×< i don't have one...i do have an oil diffuser but that made my throat dry up for some reason so i only use it when I'm well orz. it's been like 15 minutes but i can vouch for cider vinegar tho

9463 2018-04-02 01:30:32 das dat oil for yo ass
9464 2018-04-02 01:30:07 Try Aussie moist it’s like $5 a bottle and some Olive oil brands. Just try them out. For dry scalp you can just use olive oil or tea tree 
9465 2018-04-02 01:30:06 No gruel yet... Maybe tomorrow. K tried to sneak oil in it to "grease the skids" which pissed me off...
9466 2018-04-02 01:29:57 Kismit.
Or karma.
She's the one.
9467 2018-04-02 01:29:50 I know exactly who I am. What I believe & there isn't a SINGLE woman I know from the Ranchers wives out here to the wives of the men who KILL themselves every day out in the hot sun to bring you GAS and OIL! FARMERS wives.  to A ONE! they would LOOK YOU RIGHT IN THE EYE!
9468 2018-04-02 01:29:42 Eveything is marinated is sesame oil
9469 2018-04-02 01:29:19 First of all your stupid because oil never went anywhere but up in production under obama second coal is dirty there is no such thing as clean coal that’s why it’s not really coming back since plants are being replaced with natural gas which was also way up in production
9470 2018-04-02 01:29:02 Cbd oil truly does work.
9471 2018-04-02 01:29:02 Can we perhaps get it to the level of referring to it as a dossier, Re: the use of oil by Gabe Kapler, and effective communication thereafter?
9472 2018-04-02 01:28:52 Splitting hairs and burning midnight oil, presstitutes are getting ready for 2019
9473 2018-04-02 01:28:47 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
9474 2018-04-02 01:28:47 You know your brother doesn't like you when he buys tuna ya vegetable oil and not the other one 

Ugh.

9478 2018-04-02 01:28:38 My oil heater turned on at the same time I turned the lights on to that room and I jumped and hid like a bomb was about to go off I was so scared!
9479 2018-04-02 01:27:59 Reminded me of the time she made a cake & accidentally used garlic flavored veg oil. 
She still frosted it & served it. 
9480 2018-04-02 01:27:45 We’ve all been going about peanut oil the wrong way.
9481 2018-04-02 01:27:37 すまんな…
9482 2018-04-02 01:27:29 pls pls snake oil pt 3 they make me laugh sooooooooool goddamn hard every time
9483 2018-04-02 01:27:26 Canada isn't at all shy about shedding blood for oil elsewhere in the world. That Indigenous men and women participate in this boggles the mind.
9484 2018-04-02 01:27:17 A well reasoned argument?
9485 2018-04-02 01:27:05 Try worrying about yourself and your idiot manager Mr Coconut Oil
9486 2018-04-02 01:27:04 If anything, their case is weaker now than it was in 2014. In addition to the demise of the oil industry there's also the inept performance of the SNP government.
9487 2018-04-02 01:26:35 Israel was on-selling Iranian Oil to EU market but the Mullahs pulled out. The bunch of crooks still owes Iran $$$$ unpaid invoices. Israel PowerPlant provided with Iranian JVC, yet Israel charges the Palestinian at the highest possible tariff rates.
9488 2018-04-02 01:26:33 It was an odd Easter break.

My mom is a blessing. She let me hang out, drink her beer, eat her food, and she packed an Easter dinner for someone else when I mentioned it without asking.

My dad changed the oil in my car.
9489 2018-04-02 01:26:26 Over here with my feet kicked up, drinking freshly brewed coffee and eating some rich, chocolate cake. Essential oil candles burning. Black cat and black dog on the couch to my left. Well rested and ready for my work week to start. 

I. Am. Living. My. Best. Life. 
9490 2018-04-02 01:26:15 i ditched fish oil, calcium supplements,  after watching your podcast and hearing your thoughts on it, drinking milk daily for calcium, vitamin D ,eat kale for Vit K , eat fair healthy amount salt&sugar as well, my TSH is 3.4 now but it was 2.5 in last August. You think im good??
9491 2018-04-02 01:26:15 I have oily skin so I can’t do the serum and oil cleanser every day, I alternate. I’m waiting for my Banila  cleansing balm to come in hopefully I can replace that step!
9492 2018-04-02 01:26:06 This is my son James Petroski, he serves as a Volunteer Fire Fighter for Cooks Point and the Fire Department responded to an Oil Well Fire on 3/29/18. I am so proud of him.
9493 2018-04-02 01:26:04 The only comparison to watching as it occurred ? Observing a Snake Oil salesmen unfold his carnie tent.
9494 2018-04-02 01:25:57 I think this is a strongly worded letter regarding the excessive use of coconut oil while preparing to communicate the plan to make the #playoffs
9495 2018-04-02 01:25:53 No sewing machine oil. But I do have an air duster. I’ll try that. Thank you! 
Did you have a nice Easter?
9496 2018-04-02 01:25:49 coconut oil by @lizzo is A++++++
9497 2018-04-02 01:25:20 definitely need to stop playin and get my oil change done..
9498 2018-04-02 01:25:02 $60 for baby oil with ground up killawatt, no ma’am.
9499 2018-04-02 01:24:49 It's cheap and maintenance is sparsely needed and easy. You just need to clean and oil most pistols after 2,000-5,000 rounds or for excessive period of inactivity. A lot of pistols, if bought new, come w/ everything you need to clean outside of gun oil and rags which are cheap.
9500 2018-04-02 01:24:33 It's pretty hilarious that when it comes to defending Harper's disastrous mismanagement of the economy, it's 'b-b-ut the recession!', yet no mention of the oil crash when it comes to Trudeau's mandate.
9501 2018-04-02 01:24:20 Natural light, south facing or a skylight. Cedar walls. Lavender oil. Small white lights--or small candles (battery ones are certainly safe). A plushy Tibetan rug. Succulents and ivy. Well rounded beach stones of various weights to hold in the hands. A singing bowl. Air. A smile.
9502 2018-04-02 01:24:14 can't wait to spend literally 30$ on Uber tomorrow for a mandatory trip to a fuckin olive oil specialty store

9504 2018-04-02 01:24:06 It was round three that really seemed to matter, but I’m also eating one meal a day and soylent for the rest, taking some supplements, using a magnesium oil spray- I got a typewriter??? Maybe I should try drinking water.
9505 2018-04-02 01:23:41 Not very good after the first game. I did not transition well. I’m going to practice the delivery on practice although I know I cannot simulate that oil pattern. Thank You for asking.
9506 2018-04-02 01:23:30 there's gotta be a solution pero like i use benefit matte rescue a beauty blender laura mercier setting powder i even bake my nose pero no it's an ocean of oil on there smh i need the beauty guru tricks

9512 2018-04-02 01:21:57 Coconut oil
9513 2018-04-02 01:21:32 Thats the trick.  Also, get a pizza stone, or at least, a pan with holes.
550 if you can do it.

If you start to put too many toppings, drizzle with olive oil, helps the top cook before the crust burns.
9514 2018-04-02 01:21:21 Or when (not if) the price of oil falls...
9515 2018-04-02 01:21:00 If you have sewing machine oil (yeah I know my age is showing) or an air duster for a computer to get dust and dirt off of the internal parts.
9516 2018-04-02 01:20:58 Prime News: Canadian Economy Shrinks in January: The Canadian economy shrank in January amid a sharp decline in oil production, which implies that first-quarter growth is likely to underwhelm after surging in 2017. Gross domestic product contracted 0.1 percent in January from…
9517 2018-04-02 01:20:53 When the grease from your pizza takes off your long-wear lipstick, that counts as oil cleansing, right? #skincare #myskincareroutine
9518 2018-04-02 01:20:51 That would please the Liberals. No oil and no cars.
9519 2018-04-02 01:20:42 yeah, for instance, the left doesn't want to debate facts like climate change with dipshit oil industry yahoos
9520 2018-04-02 01:20:41 Yupp, it's actually #Oil.

9521 2018-04-02 01:20:38 #FanBite #TalkingDead When she’s had enough of “I’ll change the oil next weekend.”
9522 2018-04-02 01:20:28 I need a hot oil treatment bad
9523 2018-04-02 01:20:19 John Legend was also the best part of "La La Land". Wear that like anointment oil. #JCSLive #JCS #JCSunday #JesusChristSuperstarLive #JesusChristSuperstar
9524 2018-04-02 01:20:16 Ok seriously folks, this is Jim Matheson we are talking about... he hasn’t had anything intelligent to say about the oilers for years... he’s making his own shit up
9525 2018-04-02 01:20:14 Allergic to coconut ... can you use a different oil? How much oil?
9526 2018-04-02 01:20:06 Need my oil changed too
9527 2018-04-02 01:19:59 SNAKE OIL PLEASE
9528 2018-04-02 01:19:54 So @seriousschmidt mixed some hickory liquid smoke into olive oil and then rolled some cut up fingerling potatoes around in that junk and roasted them and i am here to say ROASTED POTATOES ARE SO GOOD. THEY ARE LIKE BITE-SIZED BAKED POTATOES.
9529 2018-04-02 01:19:50 Make sure you're adding a light coat of oil before storing it
9530 2018-04-02 01:19:48 Drench yourself in coconut oil
9531 2018-04-02 01:19:44 The @Phillies are the laughing stock of @MLB. They should do us a favor and suspend Mr. Coconut oil for the season after this past weekend. He SUCKS! Look like another #MacPhailure #FireKlentak
9532 2018-04-02 01:19:31 The boom over the last several years in American energy production has turned the country into a significant exporter of oil and natural gas, which has bolstered the economy.
9533 2018-04-02 01:19:30 Really? Where can I get jojoba oil at?
9534 2018-04-02 01:19:18 While Michelle's speech therapy is having positive results it turns some phrases into tongue twisters.  "Olive oil" for some reason is nearly impossible to get out.  She's trying so hard and you can see the strain she's under trying to get it out.

Galbanum essential oil!
9548 2018-04-02 01:16:56 A fine piece, sprinkling real concerns shared by most rational Canadians with false claims. Leaving oil in Alberta does not mean others with less environmental concern will too. A pipeline through a forest does not require the forest to be removed. Pipelines don’t kill Salmon
9549 2018-04-02 01:16:55 Had to go back to using my vitamin-E oil

9558 2018-04-02 01:14:52 I think the snake oil ones are hilarious. I could definitely go for a third.
9559 2018-04-02 01:14:40 Jesus sacrificed his own life for you. He did not leave us with nothing but a few miracles. He left us with the Holy oil so that we can heal ourselves after he was gone. If anyone wants the miracle left to us by Jesus I will give you the recipe. Amen.
9560 2018-04-02 01:14:21 Have oil the Americans and Europeans lust over controlling? #petrodollar
9561 2018-04-02 01:13:54 Possibly the lands had already been cleared quite some time ago in Java and were already being utilized for mainly rice, also fruit, vegetable, coffee and spice production. Palm oil came later. Indonesia the worlds largest exporter of palm oil. Plenty of plantations elsewhere.
9562 2018-04-02 01:13:51 the ordinary has a lot of nice stuff (retinoid, vit c, exfoliants, etc) but also tamanu oil is great!! like mixed in w moisturizer
9563 2018-04-02 01:13:34 With oil it'll become too expensive to drill. At least in crypto the difficulty can be lowered...
9564 2018-04-02 01:13:34 It is kind of fascinating that speculative long positions are high in crude oil (trumpeted by bears as to why the oil price should go down) but the same speculation does seem to exist in the equities (trumpeted by bulls as to why equities should outperform).
9565 2018-04-02 01:13:31 Okay. 1 is a senior undergrad thesis. 2. "economic policies of socialism of the 21st century have worsened the crisis of the oil‐rent‐based development model." Another stinging indictment of socialism. 3. the mises institute: a right-wing capitalist apologist org.
9566 2018-04-02 01:13:29 the oil i put on my face for my acne literally smells so strong and makes me cry

9568 2018-04-02 01:13:16 YES SNAKE OIL PLEASE OMGG
9569 2018-04-02 01:13:07 e.g. not expanding the Kinder Morgan trans mountain pipeline as a matter of national policy.  The cost of such a policy would be lost incremental oil revenue against the avoided emissions associated with increases in shipped diluted bitumen and finished fuels ~ $178/tonne GHG
9570 2018-04-02 01:12:59 Now, now. We all know ESPN and hockey go together as well as oil and water.
9571 2018-04-02 01:12:59 ‘For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall; sharp as a double edge sword.’ The Bible makes me laugh sometimes.
9572 2018-04-02 01:12:53 Remember, don’t pour oil down the kitchen sink. They’ll do it, but the US military HATES liberating Kohlers.

9580 2018-04-02 01:10:55 We have been advocating for our students from a classroom for more than a decade. We must show up. We must hold our representatives accountable, we must run for office where our representatives are beholden to the oil magnates (my district has the great @Walkefor87 ).

9588 2018-04-02 01:09:38 There are also trails from the Champlain Heights Irving side if you park at Silver Falls church. I always thought that Irving Oil should put a walking trail through there as they like to promote their wetland, and Loch Lomond Rd has no sidewalk in that area.
9589 2018-04-02 01:09:36 snake oil is never a bad idea

9603 2018-04-02 01:06:21 It was the British who wanted the oil, The British convinced Eisenhower that Mossadegh supported the Soviets and would turn Iran communist. Hence, Kermit Roosevelt led the overthrow of Mossadegh, But I agree Mossadegh was a good man and his overthrow was wrong
9604 2018-04-02 01:06:20 How about the Americans you have stolen Social Security from or our environment you are allowing to be polluted by the oil companies or the poor and needy, people you are taking healthcare from?   You sanctimonious words ring hollow
9605 2018-04-02 01:06:02 I’m gon regret putting this coconut oil on
9606 2018-04-02 01:05:43 I live in Trump country, and I think their hatred of Obama was based on lies and propaganda from sources like Fox News, so they bought what Trump the snake oil salesmen was selling, no longer feeling they have to be politically correct, a what about me altitude.
9607 2018-04-02 01:05:38 I use it on spots the drycleaners don't get out and it gets them out. Amazing stuff. Even on oil marks

9612 2018-04-02 01:05:06 Long weekend brunching... yes, please! Be sure to head into Pave Cafe for their 'Slashed Avocado.' Think toasted sourdough rye with olive oil, sliced avocado, Danish fetta, lemon, radish and mint. 
9613 2018-04-02 01:05:01 “I know right? It was hot motor oil.”
9614 2018-04-02 01:04:57 I find lavender oil is the best thing for burns on your hand from cooking, but not for cuts
9615 2018-04-02 01:04:44 CBD oil works great for me. Some autistic people refuse to entertain the idea that there are treatments out there, and some of them help. I don't understand why people don't try stuff. Don't dismiss things just because GPs don't know about them.

9620 2018-04-02 01:04:00 Bleeding a furnace is done in order to remove air from the fuel lines in the event that the furnace runs out of oil to burn. This is best done by a professional. Understanding why it’s important will help you determine when you need to call Fuel Services.
9621 2018-04-02 01:03:54 Anyone have any experience with compression socks and foot pain relief? Does it work or is it another snake oil scam? Thanks.
9622 2018-04-02 01:03:49 coconut oil is undefeated for best makeup remover for mascara
9623 2018-04-02 01:03:47 This will sound odd, but I find rinsing my mouth with coconut oil seems to be soothing. Really weird to be swishing that around, but I notice a difference in healing speed and pain level when I stop using coco oil. Especially w newly broken teerh.
9624 2018-04-02 01:03:41 My hairdresser tells me to put shampoo in my hair before I get it wet as apparently it lifts more of the dirt and oil off of your hair. Maybe try that?

9628 2018-04-02 01:02:58 There are a few things you should ask for before you purchase and CBD product. Is it a "Full-Spectrum" or "Isolate"? It’s called full spectrum because all of the cannabinoids are present, minus THC. Many researchers believe full spectrum oil is needed... http://cbdbiocare.inf/

9640 2018-04-02 01:01:48 I disagree David. Assistant Coaches should have been let go in November, when it was obvious they failed at Special Teams. Not sure I'd let Tmac go just yet. #Oilers

9644 2018-04-02 01:01:14 being dirty is so liberating tho. brush ur teeth with coconut oil. wash ur hair twice a month with baking soda. trash the deodorant. bask in the glory
9645 2018-04-02 01:01:13 Oh, used oil pastels to outline, then pic uploaded and opened in Photoshop.
9646 2018-04-02 01:01:09 I use it after toning before moisturizing so it soaks in quicker. I seal with vitamin e oil.
9647 2018-04-02 01:00:59 Why would you want to fit into your bras, just don't wear them ... 
You should also look into Bulletproof coffee. Coffee, grassfed butter, MCT Oil. You have this in the morning before actually eating. I lost 23kg on this a while ago
9648 2018-04-02 01:00:57 I haven’t touched oil in months that shit take too long to dry but yeah ima have to do dat to em tonight
9649 2018-04-02 01:00:47 You're wrong about both.  The more oil infrastructure is produced, the more oil will be produced.  And any leader that won't even stand up for the Paris agreement (which is far too weak) can't be considered progressive from an environmental standpoint.
9650 2018-04-02 01:00:39 Ben Carson went out Standard Oil. They're just say "perspective"?
9651 2018-04-02 01:00:34 Snake oil and nuclear winter/space survivor!!
9652 2018-04-02 01:00:27 Her logic is totally flawed. 7 billion people on the planet and only 36 million in Canada will have no influence in emissions versus Russia and China's population. Yet we import oil from the most sadistic countries and keep our own people out of great jobs.
9653 2018-04-02 01:00:20 Love those Gulf oil spills too, I’m sure those have been great for the economy in Louisiana. And boy those storms because of climate change are super awesome in New Orleans. BUT THE JOBS. Ignorant GOP base.

9661 2018-04-02 00:59:36  Depends on the level of grit on the scrubbing device and use of sufficient oil to leave a nice sheen after?
9662 2018-04-02 00:59:14 What is a good brand of pen that heats oil fer pleasure smokin?
9663 2018-04-02 00:59:00 Tomorrow bro, gotta get my oil changed
9664 2018-04-02 00:58:58 Its 6 yrs im here,studied here& worked in biggest oil&gas projects in Alberta as Eng & paying the same tax as a citizen but because my PR is delayed I dont benefit from,
This unfair trend in #DelayedIranianApplications doesnt fit in with Canada with all values we know
9665 2018-04-02 00:58:56 ジー
9666 2018-04-02 00:58:40 Strange, as it was Blair that opened the door to privatisation of the NHS and the education system, as well as the starting of the oil wars, and wars without end. What 'moderate' genuine socialist can sensibly support anything like that, and still ask to be taken seriously #JC4PM
9667 2018-04-02 00:58:32 So snake oil? Yikes.

9669 2018-04-02 00:58:07 No Randy, a big part of the problem is the pipeline.  As a former resident of Nebraska, the risk to the huge underground water source from spills, as well as eminent domain for foreign gain against landowners is just wrong.  We also don’t need this dirty oil. @janekleeb
9670 2018-04-02 00:57:27 @hallmarkchannel The @NatureMade Fish Oil product placement in Home by Spring was a little too obvious for my liking.  Please file this with the complaint department. #marketing
9671 2018-04-02 00:57:16 We won't have the Bight for much longer if we don't protect it properly.
We'll have The Great Australian Oil Slick if we're not careful.
Yet AGAIN money outweighs the National Interest.
9672 2018-04-02 00:57:02 Use Bentonite clay as a face mask and Coconut oil for a moisturizer .
9673 2018-04-02 00:56:53 Conservative ones for sure but the majority wanted JT, will be the same in 2019.  Sounds like YOU get it but the rest won't.  That pipeline should have been approved and Alberta oil all the way to the east coast, can't fathom how the squares with folks out your way.
9674 2018-04-02 00:56:40 Today my Victoria’s Secret very sexy bra leaked oil!  Why the hell does a bra have oil in it...  @VictoriasSecret maybe you can share what styles have this risk so I don’t ruin more clothing?  Terrible design flaw and very disappointing.

9681 2018-04-02 00:55:52 Are those oil based? There's a perfume shop at the Pavillion that used to sell oil based perfumes in the roll-on bottles. I don't remember the name but they were on the first floor.
9682 2018-04-02 00:55:46 You missed some fun! Some of your fellow Oil fans were even questioning my Hart trophy voting credentials

9685 2018-04-02 00:55:07 Red 40 is made from crude oil. So are some other food products. Why even use junk like that. I bet natural soda would taste better and nobody would mind if soda was clear.
9686 2018-04-02 00:55:07 Huxley unknowingly reveals he himself was duped by the very propaganda mechanism he was warning about, vis: his reference to "oil & coal running out". Oh, the irony.

9701 2018-04-02 00:52:06 Oh yes because Iraq isn't a statist state where the gov owns majority of the oil.Iran is also a state where gov have very much power and owns resources.Yemen was a dictatorship, and so was Afghanistan which is in shambles sinceit was a communist state in the 60s.

9753 2018-04-02 00:42:15 Yes and no! Dry shampoo helps to absorb the oil so it’s perfectly fine to use when your hair has excess oil. It can sometimes cause more build up though. That’s why some dry shampoos from salon brands are more expensive, they’re formulated to break down the oil, odor, and buildup

9760 2018-04-02 00:41:43 The problem isn't dependency on the fuels.  We out produce our needs.  The problem is we subsidize big oil to overproduce and export for profit.  We pay them to strip national resources.

Look at Norway, look at their sovereign wealth fund, look at their standard of living.
9761 2018-04-02 00:41:20 I was my face with Black african soap and use the shea moisture hydrating oil at night so it doesn’t get dried out and 3 days a week I use the peter thomas roth gel exfoliant. works. wonders. plus drink lots of water !!

9778 2018-04-02 00:38:09 Deficit isn’t losing money, we grew our exports to more than $1.3 trillion which means we created jobs. Those jobs are income and buying power. 
Most of our deficit is with oil. 

If Donald cares about America ask him why his businesses are excluded tariff attacks.

9783 2018-04-02 00:37:26 Israel is not being threatened by Syria and can handle itself, and we’re not getting oil that’s near Syria. Unnecessarily flexing military muscles at Russia is how you can turn a regional conflict into a clash of superpowers.
9784 2018-04-02 00:37:12 Marijuana itself is still illegal in my area, so I use hemp-based CBD oil in a few diff forms. Helps with anxiety and unwinding when I get stuck on something.

9789 2018-04-02 00:35:27 We don't hate trump. We hate his actions. We love America and see him sell it to foreigners under the guise of business. Bears Ears selling for mining, Infrastructure selling for toll roads and bridges, keystone oil spill, offshoredrilling-foreign companies.. you are blind.

9799 2018-04-02 00:33:20 The future of oil sands will be decided by market forces. If markets return to prices that can sustain growth, we need honesty about what that means for the rest of Canada and our national emissions targets & prospects for economic growth outside the WSB.

9803 2018-04-02 00:32:46 What's is freedom, Is this a Persia controlled by the US/UK to exploit the resources. How was BP created, by buying oil for a nickle from Ahwaz and selling for a dollar. Another huge thought is the Iran/Iraq war. 

Britain and Germany supplied works for gas

9804 2018-04-02 00:32:35 snake oil is dope but have you considered just sitting in a make-shift library and just shushing each other and saying welcome for and hour
9805 2018-04-02 00:32:35 Bisa.. Pada dasarnya semua carrier oil bisa buat cleansing maupun moisturizing. Btw kalo cuka apelnya bikin terlalu kering mungkin harus di adjust, apakah harus dicampur/diencerin sebelum pakai atau frekuensinya agak lebih jarang..
9806 2018-04-02 00:32:28 I just put too much peppermint oil in my diffuser.   fhis maybe death my aromatherapy.  yikes.
9807 2018-04-02 00:32:14 snake oil is lame
9808 2018-04-02 00:32:14 This is a for instance, and it's not a local news station, but the antithesis of Trumplandia, in many people's minds: MSNBC. Well, it's ultimately owned by General Electric, which makes aircraft engines & trains, drills for oil & gas, and its CEO went to Wharton.

9810 2018-04-02 00:31:25 Use coconut oil & it will help your burn!
9811 2018-04-02 00:31:23 Is it just me or does Mark Emmert look like a trying-too-hard snake oil salesman?
9812 2018-04-02 00:30:58 Yesss I like the snake oil podcasts!
9813 2018-04-02 00:30:38 yes pls snake oil
9814 2018-04-02 00:30:34 Agree with your take on Indian restaurants. They use the formula proven successful - use salt, oil and sugar - to attract customers.  It is hazardous to eat out in general anywhere these days.
9815 2018-04-02 00:30:13 i just want to be studying at sam houston already and i want to be doing the dcp and i want to be living a nice independent life and i just wanna like get all the bad stuff off bc its like oil and its suffocating and the worst type of black that comes with immense dread and yuck

9817 2018-04-02 00:30:10 Twitter and other politicians are not that of the opponents of abortion rights by suggesting that the NSA is setting up an oil well leaks in
9818 2018-04-02 00:30:09 I would too. Other countries are making substantial moves while Canada remains beholden to the oil and gas industry. None of the parties offers much in the way of hope.
9819 2018-04-02 00:29:57 The exon valdez is legendary as well.
Which is ironic as it & British cars are legends for the same thing. Being mobile oil slicks 
Hey I drive a Mini. Real one, it's major feature being it does its own oil changes.

9823 2018-04-02 00:28:59 Do you have the microphone turned off for Facebook?
9824 2018-04-02 00:28:28 Really the solar industry employs more people than oil and gas ? I get installers but are they made here? I kind of have my doubts on that statement
9825 2018-04-02 00:27:44 The Nigerian media has been so fair to IBB and unfair to PMB. The reasons are simple. IBB is corrupt,has oil blocks via proxy,lives in a 50bedroom mansion,owns a lots of business via proxy and makes a lot of money to bribe the media. PMB does not posses any of it. PMB only Sin

9832 2018-04-02 00:25:52 Oh no!! Yeah sometimes we get munching bugs too... water with neem oil & dish soap in it sprayed on the leaves and undersides seemed to help prior. I dunno what “real gardeners” or whatever do, but this was for a UFO squash so I didn’t want to put anything super gross on it
9833 2018-04-02 00:25:19 Oil is great for my knees and the plant itself is very easy to grow, drought and pest resistant, and makes a biodegradable plastic wood and paper

9843 2018-04-02 00:22:32 Also, it wouldn't be our oil anyway, so our depending on it is irrelevant. I like you. I just don't get this comment. 
The pipeline IS a problem.
9844 2018-04-02 00:22:28 They shouldn't drill ANYWHERE unsafely. Insanity is to ruin natural resources to pull dirty oil. Need regulations, not tax breaks.

9847 2018-04-02 00:22:14 Snake oil podcasts are the best!!! Yes please
9848 2018-04-02 00:21:48 Yeah, the US usually thinks more about its use of oil; Canada, Norway, and Qatar are very much big oil suppliers. That's also why I don't like trade surpluses: imagine if we decided Indonesia manufactures better than China…or moved to solar-wind and stopped buying from OPEC.
9849 2018-04-02 00:21:48 Snake oil pt 3 pizza party or a podcast talking about possible libraries across the country for your upcoming tour 2019
9850 2018-04-02 00:21:43 There is not now nor has there ever been any peanut oil in vaccines, & certainly not allergenic peanut proteins. You have taken a general lie, & then built your own personal lie on top of it. This seems to be a pattern with you, to draw more sympathy to your thirsty self.

God gave you a brain and common sense, what happened again? Check your head, it's low on oil...
9862 2018-04-02 00:20:27 "To the massive detriment of all, very likely leading to my early pointless death, I will fight and even die to remain cucked by snake oil salesman and sociopaths"

9873 2018-04-02 00:18:35 I am getting bored with you kids.

ICYMI: Last week the oil companies told in court, that they agree with IPCC; the climate is warming because of human actions.

Why not get into 2018's you two denier clowns ?
9874 2018-04-02 00:18:35 How man go do,Assemble by so so so hours,dismiss parade sososo,light out by sososo into ur dorm.
9875 2018-04-02 00:18:32 -agreed on this one again? Oh yeah it was big, and Simon felt spoiled and you know it was big. Room for them both, comfortably. 

Simon let it fill up, pouring in the lavender oil into it and mixing it in before leaving it and peeking his head-
9876 2018-04-02 00:18:27 And alot of Russian $ now embedded in the GOP as well. Mercer's, Dark Money all connected to the Russian mob oligarchs, legal under RU laws, alot of that is also connected w Big Oil $ btw USA & Russia...thus deregs of EPA to favor as well. This is epitome of corruption.
9877 2018-04-02 00:18:20 Without the pipeline, we expect they'll just build refineries up in or near Canada. Don't forget, we—and many nations—don't depend on oil for just energy, but massive export income. US forests are being destroyed to export biomass to Europe, too.
9878 2018-04-02 00:18:13 First oil trade alert of the week just went out #boom Here we go.
9879 2018-04-02 00:18:08 You should do a conspiracy theory pt 5 of not snake oil is always good
9880 2018-04-02 00:17:55 It's a tough problem, especially since many of us support the working class, and lots of pipeworkers/steelworkers are employed by the oil industry these days. Similar issue to coal industry, collapse is just further off.
9881 2018-04-02 00:17:47 @KatRamsland I picked up a Oil Field Water Truck Hauler at the Rest Stop.  He drove us to that border.  He went home to his family in Mexico.  I drove on to my hotel.
9882 2018-04-02 00:17:42 Oil and water.
9883 2018-04-02 00:17:39 Chanel Misia makes me smell like I fell into a vat of baby oil and I honestly can’t complain about that
9884 2018-04-02 00:17:29 The "full service" stations here in Oregon just have an attendant fill your tank. They *might* occasionally wash your windshield if the attendant feels like it. No oil or air checks.
9885 2018-04-02 00:17:22 No worries! Slightly less olive oil than butter, and if you like slightly spicy tats you can dust some paprika on them too ;D.
9886 2018-04-02 00:17:09 Ya I really don’t know what snake oil is but I would watch you guys stare at the camera in silence for an hour straight while the dogs go wild
9887 2018-04-02 00:17:08 Wow! I see
9888 2018-04-02 00:16:52 Do you prefer the long, thick ones from Idaho, the crocked carrot shaped sweet ones or the short bulbous red ones that go well with rosemary and olive oil?
9889 2018-04-02 00:16:52 If the environmentalist are concerned about Crude Oil, they could make a good start by moving away from styrofoam and plastics, instead of protesting a needed pipeline
9890 2018-04-02 00:16:45 Getcha a girl who can change her own oil
9891 2018-04-02 00:16:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9892 2018-04-02 00:16:26 If they invest now into CSSP, reform TSC contracts & establish a modern NOC. Bear in mind my comment was about diversification, that is harder than increasing oil production. That's macro economic reform. Nothing has been done other than fancy words & pledges to that end. /fin
9893 2018-04-02 00:16:16 And everything all put together for the Easter - Birthday Basket for the kiddo. I even included one of my salt dough oil diffuser ornaments .. he’s 7 he won’t care  but I’m all about packaging  he wanted his own little bug balm stick too so I couldn’t resist 
9894 2018-04-02 00:16:08 Snake oil baby.....or a cooking show....
9895 2018-04-02 00:16:00 Plus i need a oil change and I’m broke  one step at a time lord.
9896 2018-04-02 00:15:59 Snake oil is great! (I also love the conspiracy/spooky casts you guys do!)
9897 2018-04-02 00:15:45 Creepy, isn’t it? 
9898 2018-04-02 00:15:43 Oil leaks are a bad argument: we pretty much ship the oil anyway, but run it through old pipelines at well-above design pressure, and then declare a Federal Superfund site where leaks show up. The leaks would be smaller with a modern pipeline. Other arguments are mostly correct.
9899 2018-04-02 00:15:42 Pelicans with a totally unispiring, listless performance tonight. This team's lacksidasicle play at home is mind-giggling. Pels leaking oil down the stretch. When both AD&Jrue are off this team has no chance. Niko Mirotic has played like shit for going on a month.
9900 2018-04-02 00:15:34 dreaming is like a bottle of oil repulsing bronze
9901 2018-04-02 00:15:34 Wait till they see the Tornados gently turning on the glistening oil coated steel cuisine pipes.
9902 2018-04-02 00:15:23 oil me down ling ling
9903 2018-04-02 00:15:22 I also use witch hazel as toner, an oil free moisturizer, vitamin E oil on my scars, the Aztec healing clay mask, and I was my face twice a day with gentle cleanser
9904 2018-04-02 00:15:21 It has nothing to do with trying to prove we’re safer. I’m not saying we are or aren’t. You also can’t try and use deaths by country to prove guns are the reason, as the US has less deaths per gun, is the point.
9905 2018-04-02 00:15:15 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
9906 2018-04-02 00:14:59 Yessss please. Snake Oil 1&2 literally made me laugh until I cried

9910 2018-04-02 00:13:36 I’ve been putting jojoba oil on my nails for two days and my fingernail has the AUDACITY to break?????? Oils are fake.
9911 2018-04-02 00:13:30 In the church now that's all kinds of disrespectful... Better throw some holy oil around afterwards #RHOA
9912 2018-04-02 00:13:29 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
9913 2018-04-02 00:13:12 I really hoped we could get to this point. Been thinking about it since @gracewiles mentioned the midnight oil.
9914 2018-04-02 00:12:53 Because we pay more into the pot than we take out. Most of it is from oil. Do you want us to take more than we put in? We can all sit on our lazy asses and complain. It worked elsewhere.
9915 2018-04-02 00:12:52 More snake oil please. I need a little laugh for this rough week.
9916 2018-04-02 00:12:45 I can answer that cause the potatoes are my babies. Boil until they are cooked through but not to the point that they will break upon skewer impact. Melt a mix of butter and olive oil with liberal amounts of salt and baste, then roast for over an hr at 200c. Remember to turn!
9917 2018-04-02 00:12:43 Does olive oil come from green or black olives?
9918 2018-04-02 00:12:41 あとでチェックしとこ
9919 2018-04-02 00:12:37 What?  OPEC has lowered total production from 2016- today.  With USA production doing nothing but rising a reversal of OPEC cut agreement would send the 95% crude oil positioning by managed money unwinding like 2014. History would be repeating itself once again.
9920 2018-04-02 00:12:30 At your service Mr. President.
9921 2018-04-02 00:12:26 We need to look after our own backyard and economic interests. Yes we need to be (and are) a leader in resource technology but it's economic suicide to cripple our oil industry by playing climate cop to the rest of the world.
9922 2018-04-02 00:12:19 Gadzooks! You find an alluring Scribbler who's interested in purchasing this oil painting depicting a taxidermist.
9923 2018-04-02 00:12:18 I was super productive today though! Decluttered and packed more of my apartment! Went grocery shopping, made a bomb ass dinner... paid some bills, did a coconut oil skin treatment.... living my best life right now.

9925 2018-04-02 00:11:30 an oil spill but it isnt oil & it isnt a spill its just a ~feeling~
9926 2018-04-02 00:11:27 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9927 2018-04-02 00:11:12 Of course! I recommend using this after applying an oil or other skin moisturizer 
9928 2018-04-02 00:10:58 The problem with Venezuela is that government has control over the oil industry, which is their only resource. After the price of oil fell in 2015 they could no longer afford food for their citizens

Leftists arent advocating for the government to take control over every industry
9929 2018-04-02 00:10:54 That sweet life body oil thooo. If I wasn’t broke I’d buy it

9932 2018-04-02 00:09:50 When I was little, I touched the stove door when my yiayia was baking something. It was hot. I never touched it again. I've also been burned by boiling oil spatter. Didn't like that too much either. Decided stoves are bad & I haven't been near one since 
9933 2018-04-02 00:09:49 PPG Paints arena probably smells like armpits and motor oil.

9935 2018-04-02 00:09:02 And u believe there is such a term as "alternative facts". Thnx to ppl like you who keep buying the snake oil out country is just going down the snake whole. Pls wake up.

9937 2018-04-02 00:08:21 Required? All all teens required to burn the midnight oil on school projects? Could this be bypassed by proper planning or are all teachers sadists, expecting midnight oil to be burned? Should I change my approach AND invest in midnight oil?

9940 2018-04-02 00:07:30 If I’m wrong then the world overall temperature increases by .02 degrees F in the next 100 years and we’d still not even be close to the warmest levels the earth has seen. If I’m wrong we should all stop burning oil and driving cars and flying planes tomorrow.
9941 2018-04-02 00:07:24 moisturising hair masks work wonders, specifically ones with argan oil!

9943 2018-04-02 00:07:12 Birth tourism, abortion tourism, both need to be ended.

Me, in a blanket, smothered in coconut oil, speaking out of crusty eczema lips: Everything south of Campbelltown is bullshit

9959 2018-04-02 00:05:00 We love snake oil!!!
9960 2018-04-02 00:04:38 Yes, olive oil is not a rich source of omega-3. Hopefully Women's Health can correct that point for their online version.
9961 2018-04-02 00:04:34 CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A SNAKE OIL 3 with @JCyrus!?!?!?
9962 2018-04-02 00:04:31 新学期おにぎり生活で始めるしかなかろうて！！！
9963 2018-04-02 00:04:24 Without border security all our futures are imperiled. DACA or not, changing econ and workplace demands tight immigration control
9964 2018-04-02 00:04:14 The domestic stock market had a short roller-coaster month. However, the macros pose a huge challenge in terms of rising yields, a jump in crude oil prices have created headwinds for our indices but the offshoots of recovery were visible in some of the sectors this month #lka
9965 2018-04-02 00:04:14 Bergamot oil is what I've got on me tonight, I'm amazed at what this is doing for me.

Anxiety and depression seem to be mere memories, but, is this down to me having a good day, or is this oil really the miracle I've needed?
9966 2018-04-02 00:04:11 totally down for another snake oil
9967 2018-04-02 00:04:08 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
9968 2018-04-02 00:04:07 Snake oil 3 is what the world needs to welcome April
9969 2018-04-02 00:04:01 That’s where I can get oil real cheap
9970 2018-04-02 00:03:58 Gracias fuel oil por otro nochon 
9971 2018-04-02 00:03:58 Trabajo en petróleo, en plataformas, tugs, jack ups, suezmax oil carriers ... soy culpable, Axel ?
9972 2018-04-02 00:03:54 Carter was a disaster as a potus. Did nothing for hostages, or economy. Interest rates or oil prices. Done better as x president.
9973 2018-04-02 00:03:52 Yess I really enjoyed snake oil! I'd also love it if you guys played obama llama again, that episode was so much fun
9974 2018-04-02 00:03:51 SNAKE OIL
9975 2018-04-02 00:03:41 Not seed oil?
9976 2018-04-02 00:03:34 snake oil is fine by me im down for anything that'll be either aries nonsense or virgo long talk or a mix
9977 2018-04-02 00:03:28 nor does he infuse his cooking oil, both of which are thoughtful evolutions in the recipe. Heston’s approach to a “perfect” steak or roast chicken both utilize a forebear to the reverse sear you developed, tho obviously done a bit differently. In my mind (and not knowing if ...
9978 2018-04-02 00:03:25 I would volunteer but I’m also lazy and busy with work so lazy and work are like oil and water so I’m already conflicted with my own personal issues lol.
9979 2018-04-02 00:03:13 SNAKE OIL
9980 2018-04-02 00:02:54 What kind of wasps? Most are beneficial and not aggressive. If they need to die, try orange oil. Calloway’s and Lowe’s will usually have. Mix a few ounces with water in a spray bottle and you have kill-on-contact organic bug killer. Works on ants, roaches, etc. Smells good. 
9981 2018-04-02 00:02:54 I can't believe it's getting harder and harder to find full service gasoline stations. Why back in the day you just pulled up to the gas station and the attendant would ask you how much gasoline and what type you needed and he or she would also check your engine oil and belts.
9982 2018-04-02 00:02:31 Coconut oil!! but u gotta wash it out really well cos sometimes there’s still residue :/

9985 2018-04-02 00:02:24 SKYF is the world’s first industrial grade heavy cargo drone. We partner with our current clients in oil&gas, agriculture and logistics to make SKYFchain reliable and easy to integrate into today's supply-chain. #Skyfchain
9986 2018-04-02 00:02:22 Yup. Even just oils like coconut oil (hate it) and Aegean oils. They just sit on my hair and don’t absorb at all or as quickly as others.
9987 2018-04-02 00:02:19 snake oil 3!!!!
9988 2018-04-02 00:02:19 or i'd be down for another snake oil

9993 2018-04-02 00:02:03 Social security is not an Entitlement.
We have invested our hard earned money in it for years on end.
Entitlements are giving tax breaks to oil companies, corporations and the mega rich...now we are talking entitlements!
9994 2018-04-02 00:02:02 yes, snake oil is my fave
9995 2018-04-02 00:02:01 Chelsea is only fake oil money, roman Abramovich literally schemed the russian government out of 13 billion dollars. Im not at all mad about that fact, thats an alll time finesse, but also not a joke. Look up the "russian loan for shares scheme"

10002 2018-04-02 00:01:28 The tankers there are what 10 times more going into Washington with more expected.  But I guess it's the whole it's not Canadian oil so it's ok.
10003 2018-04-02 00:01:09 Yes. So not the workers and the people, like in socialism. And they are connected to big oil. This is called fascism
