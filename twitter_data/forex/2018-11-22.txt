153 2018-11-22 20:57:41 The funny thing is that the same person paid thru RTGS will end up having money to buy those things using USD but still is surprised if asked to pay duty in forex. Let's not promote the parallel market
154 2018-11-22 20:54:00 Only people without forex in the first celebrate this announcement  and it also confirms that bond and US are not 1:1

156 2018-11-22 20:51:31 And you will get the money formally. It's one way of getting read of forex dealings. I would ask how one who does not work outside Zim or export would get the USDs if he does not get it from the bank. Definitely you will have to do it the formal way. Things need to be formalized
157 2018-11-22 20:50:43 Fair for the public interest, economic interest and national interest. If you have forex to buy luxuries or consumption you should pay for the privilege in forex as the nation needs forex. A nation is permitted to raise taxes and duty is a tax.

159 2018-11-22 20:49:04 As long an individual is able to import a motor vehicle, it becomes obvious that he/she have used hard forex to buy the vehicle out there. So if that individual is taking the hard forex out of the country what's wrong if she/he is asked to pay same currency here ?

If that's the case then faze the"paper" out
163 2018-11-22 20:45:58 With regards to car imports, we underestimate the amount of forex that was being allowed to go out only for car dealers to sell the cars make a profit and resell the forex on the BM.

Duty in forex for car imports is e same as duty increase by 300%
165 2018-11-22 20:42:12 Import Duty for cars to be paid in US Dollars imagine a Gvt that pays Civil servants in RTGS /Bonds ,where do you expect them to get Forex at the same time you refute RTGS as payment for duty as Gvt -Zimra whilst salaries come in that.Where is the sense in this ?

250 2018-11-22 19:39:16 If you purchase it using forex, then pay duty in forex surely you are going to sell it in forex. To buy the products people  will need to have the forex meaning sooner or later labour  will demand to be paid in forex.

Mthuli Ncube said duty on cars should be paid in forex yet they are paying salaries in bond.
What did we do to deserve such...

260 2018-11-22 19:33:10 The fact that one is importing means they have the forex. Similarly, if you are paying for local goods in forex, it simply means you have it. That’s a no brainer.
261 2018-11-22 19:32:04 So Mr president all civil servants can't buy cars because they are paid these RTGS. Why should govt demand duty in forex yet we have the RTGS which they say it's the same as USD?
262 2018-11-22 19:31:45 @MthuliNcube congratulations on the budget but what are the recommendations for the short term insurance industry that insure products that have been imported & duty paid in us$? eg cars 
Are premiums to be in us$?
or there will be a guarantee from gvt to provide forex @1:1?
263 2018-11-22 19:30:43 Tell me something #Zimbudget 

" cars to be cleared in forex"
" salary is in Bond currency"
" money changing is a crime"

Where will the forex come from?
264 2018-11-22 19:30:40 With forex which might not be enough to cover for duty as well.
Even the gvt now know that the Bond is a joke so they need to get rid of it completely

286 2018-11-22 19:20:32 Fuel is bought using forex by the government. Since most of us earn RTGS money, therefore we cant fund the fuel. So government has to scrounge for that forex somewhere else to pay the fuel bill. The net effect is @MthuliNcube has far less forex to spend on other essentials

290 2018-11-22 19:16:28 Arbitrage. The extent of the price differential is linked to the difference between inflation in the US and real inflation in Zimbabwe. Something forex traders won’t tell you, but in all fairness they trade intuitively & don’t know.
291 2018-11-22 19:15:38 People and trade unions taking civil servants as enemies to progress.  If u buy forex  in black market why will u not buy forex to pay duty.

296 2018-11-22 19:13:41 It's ok to pay duty in forex yet 10years if caught trading in forex. Question is where will the duty payers get the forex coz it's not in the banks and chances it's not from the diaspora neither are the bulk of employers paying in USD.

328 2018-11-22 19:00:41 Dude. Its just managing the public. I am sure he would love to say USD now sole currency but the truth of the matter is there is none. Hypocrisy will continue. Eg their cars get in duty free, you pay the forex. Hospital, they fly out, you go to Gomo!
329 2018-11-22 19:00:19 Where will you get forex to buy the car with?

333 2018-11-22 18:58:35 My question would be if people who pay in forex will be required to provide evidence to how they came in position of the forex to be paid towards the duty, because I don't know if banks will issue forex to those with US dollar duty required products???
334 2018-11-22 18:58:18 Gotta keep that forex moving somehow
335 2018-11-22 18:57:21 So I particularly dislike the sleight of hand here. They keep rate at 1:1 yet there is no forex available at that rate, so if you import a car you must buy the forex on the black market and pay your duty, yet they have criminalised that. Rock and hard place.

343 2018-11-22 18:53:12 Duty to be paid in forex  l wonder were people will get those forex from when you have rtgs  to worsen of the situation rating is considered a crime
344 2018-11-22 18:53:09 Policy inconsistency  they collect duty in usd.. Then force the trade to sale is bond or rtgs..
They pay civil servant in rtgs and expect them to pay usd wgen imorting cars.

376 2018-11-22 18:45:38 You missing the point... the value is the same but the government needs hard cash forex to import things we need like fuel and medicine.. the other is for local transacting
377 2018-11-22 18:45:12 What about Japan’s FOREX savings if it were able to restart more nuclear @MLiebreich ?

379 2018-11-22 18:44:01 Zim Govt: Bond & US$ are equal. 

Zim Govt: illegal to refuse to accept Bond 

Same Zim Govt: import duty to be paid in forex only

 
380 2018-11-22 18:43:58 Bondnotes have failed, there is no cash in banks. Forex dealing is a crime but Zimra wants USD. Fines are now x2 salaries. Bond is not gedye. I propose Panonetsa resigns & scarfists admit they are clueless and let those who can LEAD the country. I repeat LEAD not Rule

391 2018-11-22 18:38:40 Me thinks Gvt should announce an official US /Bond exchange rate. Them demanding car import duty in forex is evident enough there is a discord in currency value.

401 2018-11-22 18:33:53 The mindset is similar to the one they had when they launched Murambatsvina. Remember the “everyone came from somewhere and should go back to where they came from.” Here it’s get the forex from the same source that gave you the money to buy the car in USD.
402 2018-11-22 18:33:01 Its never one is to one and has never been. when the bonds were originally introduced, they had a 5% devalution as it was an export incentive that added a 5% bonds to any forex remittance. It was = 95 usd :$1bond from day one. We are dealing with a bigger crisis sis.
403 2018-11-22 18:32:56 Hahaha but an individual usong forex has nothing to do with ur business. As that forex is not with government its with people and not in banks. This is a cobra effect

405 2018-11-22 18:32:40 Now it all makes sense why the Gvt had to pass a law lifting importing restrictions on certain food and grocery items coz they wanted to tax y’all in forex. Well played Mthuli you bespectacled ‘genius’. Like a python you had em excited then got em in trance and bam constricted em
406 2018-11-22 18:31:46 It was a good try. I loved the duty in forex on car imports. In fact it should have been a blanket on all imports. I give him 25%. If it antony ndingadai ndati 5%.

433 2018-11-22 18:19:08 So Government of #Zimbabwe is the first to reject bond notes and RTGS balances. Motor vehicles and a whole lot of consumables now attract duty in foreign currency. Yet the same govt is refusing to pay civil servants in forex, but wants them to pay govt in Forex. Very unfair!

471 2018-11-22 17:59:23 The problem is us is we dont understand how bond note is equivalent to USD but duty is only charged in USD/forex and not bond/rtgs
472 2018-11-22 17:59:06 U have 1 million per annum discretionary allowance and a 10 million life time for individuals . The 1 million doesnt need SARB approval. U can buy forex currency at your bank and invest offshore but over a 1 million a SARB application will be required

475 2018-11-22 17:58:36 I foresee people’s savings being smashed off!! How can someone announce a budget without defining the currency in use. How can we pay forex on imports yet we earn bond through RTGS? Where are we going to buy forex? When caught 10 years in prison 
476 2018-11-22 17:58:04 Strangely, it’s a crime to trade in forex. But the Govt wants duties and taxes for several items paid in forex. Salaries are paid in RTGS. There is no cash in the banks.

No amount of fancy quotations will mask the irrationality of these policies.
477 2018-11-22 17:56:06 Hey people. Whats your take on the budget presented today. I just saw the highlights. What l have observed is that the govt want forex from the import of vehicles and reject its bond notes.
478 2018-11-22 17:55:27 It's 10yrs for dealing in forex, duty for cars is now in forex, banks have no forex. Clearly people will buy money in the streets to pay duty. #Asakhe
479 2018-11-22 17:55:15 Because cars are paid for in forex so their duty must be the same. The intent is to discourage use of forex on consumption of a scarce resource.

484 2018-11-22 17:48:35 Measures are in place if you need forex to important raw materials for production.

Mind you.even if you are selling locally, you must also work on exporting produce so you generate forex income that way as well.
How i wish we could stop looking at barriers and focus on solutions
485 2018-11-22 17:48:19 The same source you used to get money to buy your vehicle in forex outside  Zimbabwe is the same source you should use to access money to pay for duty. Unless we think other countries deserve our forex , we don’t deserve it!!!

526 2018-11-22 17:30:09 By saying pay duty in forex @MthuliNcube is simply saying we are going to limit what you import. Using SI64 creates problems with our neighbors coz of trade agreements. This is the biggest if not only austerity measure that he has put in place.

688 2018-11-22 15:58:22 HSBC: $USDJPY: We believe #USDJPY is caught  between cyclical and structural forces. The cyclical forces in the form  of US yields are pushing the pair higher, whilst the structural force of  “risk-off” sentiment is pushing the exchange rate lower.
689 2018-11-22 15:58:00 HSBC 1/2: after challenging market conditions in many asset classes and  regions during October, we have seen a resurgence of “risk on-risk off” behavior,  where changes in global risk sentiment are the dominant driver of returns. #forex #fx #currencies #forexmarket #fxmarket

699 2018-11-22 15:52:09 So the response is to punish us by hiking fuel prices, that excise duty of 7/6 cents have a maximum bearing on the poor man and woman on the road not those foreign trucks, the monetary policy dealt with that when they said the foreign trucks shall buy fuel using FOREX!
700 2018-11-22 15:51:43 The imposition of duty on forex on 216 products by Govt is a new wave of protection. Govt knows that those importing those products were sourcing their forex on the black market and the new move will increase their tax obligation. We see smuggling of these goods rising.

1380 2018-11-22 06:58:46 In a sense the forex rates are a distraction. Our concern should be a measure such as GDP at constant cost which will identify changes in output and the output per capita will tell us if the growth was meaningful.

1406 2018-11-22 06:20:30 That's true @DumisaniSiziba3, the farmers have to put a strong case to justify an increase in their retention of the forex earned to RBZ.
