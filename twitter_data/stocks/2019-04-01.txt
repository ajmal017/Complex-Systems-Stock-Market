2 2019-04-01 23:58:19 In any given year, stocks will go 50% too low and 50% too high. The best time to invest in great companies, is when others are selling!

5 2019-04-01 23:53:12 Mr Market: "I'm up 22% in 3 months and show no signs of slowing down. Why don't you buy more stocks before you miss out on all this easy money." You opened a bunch of trades. "April fools you sucker"…and then the market will go into a 10% correction. What I "think" will happen.
6 2019-04-01 23:52:15 We are in a bull market for sure. We were also in a bull market in 1999 and 2007. If the market, balance sheets & economic fundamentals support growth in free cash flow we should all be fully invested in stocks. If all you do is Tom DeMark TA, debt & systemic risk doesn't matter
7 2019-04-01 23:50:48 I need to educate myself & invest into stocks 
8 2019-04-01 23:49:35 One of the Original Big 3 Company will turn down on sales and stocks.

9 2019-04-01 23:49:32 I'm not so sure about this one Colin. Average Joe's aren't out there playing with stocks and flipping real estate.
10 2019-04-01 23:49:24 I personally love this, I have done similar moves with juggling promo/low interest rates to purchase stocks. It's a game of hot potato, if their willing to lend at little to no interest fee in a hot market I'm all for it. Great job bud 
11 2019-04-01 23:47:24 We don't have an expected timeframe for when this maintenance will be complete, but we're happy to let you know once you can transfer stocks into Robinhood again.
