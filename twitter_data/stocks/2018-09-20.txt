3 2018-09-20 23:57:43 I'd happily say allocating more than market cap to US stocks is a bet, yes.
4 2018-09-20 23:57:17 US stocks rose to record highs last night due to decreasing worries about trade tensions. This has led to ASX Futures pointing higher. Positive household wealth data contributed, OECD forecasts the US economoy to expand by 2.9% (fastest rate of growth 05')

10 2018-09-20 23:53:47 Yup.  you can run ta on crypto and all the patterns and indications will tell you it’s very likely something is about to play out how it’s suppose to and completely breaks pattern.  With stocks most people on the same ta consensus so they all trade accordingly and the patterns
11 2018-09-20 23:53:30 if anyone actually wants to get into investing then hmu bc i started i can already see that this is the wave. it’s hella easy money and i can set you up. and you can invest in marijuana stocks too if you’re into that kind of thing.
12 2018-09-20 23:53:28 To late, it is now guilty until proven innocent. Testify Monday or vote. Obviously a delay tactic shamefully weakening the #MeToo movement
13 2018-09-20 23:52:21 Keep buying back your own stocks to inflate the market, Wall Street!  Get rich and then let it crash and leave it for the Dems to have to clean up!  I see you!  Way to go!  Go celebrate w that tax cut money handout you got, too

17 2018-09-20 23:51:52 I gotta tell you...if retail investors fueled that run today (no fuggin way did they) I feel bad for their ass. They got suckered. I stick to my word....stocks are giving you a false spike b4 a crash. Good luck to anyone buying over there. Like buying bitcoin at 18k day it hit 19
18 2018-09-20 23:51:10 regular people don't have stocks or shares- only your wealthy buddies get wealthier..
19 2018-09-20 23:50:22 This movie is the junk that @Fandango + @Twitter promote+applaud. Stocks at all time highs. Unemployment at all time lows(even for Latinos + African Americans).

41 2018-09-20 23:49:19 You keep referring to bloated stocks as a sign in a thriving economy, which just isn’t the case, my guy.
42 2018-09-20 23:48:55 Trump's wild card is that the BOJ buys any stock market weakness. I think that's the quid pro quo no one talks about. Japan is not listed as an unfair trader in exchange for buying US stocks... look at USD/JPY ramped hard at the US open today!
43 2018-09-20 23:48:52 Actually didnt start to buy stocks yet, but been reading various materials for 4/5months. Started with The Snowball Effect, then found various youtubers on the subject + investopedia. In fact, the main reason why I dont own stocks yet is because Robinhood is unavailable in EU 1/2
44 2018-09-20 23:48:44 I should have bought stocks in @Hallmark cards... sheesh!

47 2018-09-20 23:46:37 put this shit bag in the stocks and lets see his poker face
48 2018-09-20 23:46:30 I too am hoping it’s $APH. They are keeping pretty quiet. I thought they had a meeting yesterday but have heard nothing. The news today didn’t move the stock at all. Looking like $CRON may overtake $APH share price the way it’s going.
49 2018-09-20 23:46:04 Yet GDP is up, stocks are at record numbers and unemployment is lowest in years.....yeah he has no clue what hes doing
50 2018-09-20 23:44:51 Goodmorning!!!! Expecting my stocks to arrive today hehe  TYL!!
51 2018-09-20 23:44:36 Or prison uniforms because a whole lot of traitors are going to go down for their illegal crimes. Stocks in manufacturing prison clothing hillary orange would be a good investment
52 2018-09-20 23:43:46 Asda stocks fall 90% as twitter dot com user granit jacka steals precisely two packets of smartprice smoked bacon
53 2018-09-20 23:43:41 The stock market grows from the buying and selling of stocks. The big spenders are the rich. The stock buyers are mostly the rich with small participation of everyday workers to their 401K accounts.
54 2018-09-20 23:42:41 We have waited for a long time.There should be an increase in production of Maine's lipstick.We are expecting more stocks.Knowing how PHENOMENAL your endorser @mainedcm people don't care much about the price.Hoping there will be more lippies available online for moms like me..
55 2018-09-20 23:42:37 The brown line is so weird. Saw one guy checking stocks on his phone, another wearing a LinkedIn shirt.

57 2018-09-20 23:41:37 Are you implying that only reach people can own stocks?
58 2018-09-20 23:38:07 Wages are broadly flat when adjusted for inflation ! Sorry!
Only roughly 50% of Americans own stocks!! A booming stock market skews towards the wealthiest 10%. Not a broad indicator of the health of the overall economy. Sorry!

$TLRY $NBEV
60 2018-09-20 23:36:41 In some $PTX at .80 for a gamble play. Needs more volume but looking for .85-1.00 to sell.
61 2018-09-20 23:36:25 Out of stock. New stock coming in next month. Advanced booking fee $499.99. Colours come in shit brown and diarrhoea green. Whilst stocks last.

64 2018-09-20 23:32:40 Trade-sensitive industrial stocks led the Dow Jones to a record closing high, the last of Wall Street's main indexes to fully regain ground since a correction that began in January. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 22 points higher at 6,165. #ausshares #stockmarket
65 2018-09-20 23:32:31 @JBPritzker calls for additional gun control measures - bump stocks, gun dealer licensing
66 2018-09-20 23:32:28 When the top 10% own 84% of the stocks it is not a representation of how the average American is doing. The fact that over 50% of Americans make 30k or less is representative of the average American
67 2018-09-20 23:31:13 Yup. I hear ya. I do also have about top 15 TSX stocks. I can easily pick top 5 among them though as the top 5 accounts for about 65% of my total portfolio. Let’s exchange our watchlist some day?

69 2018-09-20 23:30:17 You can open a mutual fund account with next to nothing. Tens of millions of Americans who aren't rich have equities -- stocks, mutuals, 401Ks or market-invested pension funds.
70 2018-09-20 23:30:07 U-CAR racing up next, then Any Car.  There will be a brief intermission after that for track cleanup, then Late Model Stocks. #NWAAS
71 2018-09-20 23:29:23 Trump and his cronies like Ross and Mnuchin are all shorting stocks based on what is getting tariffed... they all know aforehand.  That’s the big grift.
72 2018-09-20 23:29:22 #Cryptocurrency was all hyped and the value skyrocketed until it came crashing. #Cannabis stocks have been on the rise but could it be promising and better then crypto? #JustAsking #StockWatch #Investment #MillennialInvesting
73 2018-09-20 23:29:15 That fat paycheck is coming any day now. And Jesus knows that the price for the stock market rise is obviously defined by hours spent in cages by children. We know all you unheard blue collar workers have tons of money invested in stocks.
74 2018-09-20 23:27:18 Market will let us know. I don't try to think too much into these things. And as always, I'm not out to win the stock, just out to win. Plenty of great setups on other stocks. :)
75 2018-09-20 23:25:36 Now you are just stating your opinion on stocks. Since I refuted your point, I see you have nothing to come back with. Have fun

79 2018-09-20 23:24:09 People have short (no pun intended) memories.  Clearly there are bubbles here, however having personal experience with hemp oil, cancer, and pain I am high ahem on Cannabis stocks.  Real companies with sales, marketing and products.
80 2018-09-20 23:23:21 Well no.

trump is doing the exact same thing Reagan and George W. Bush did.

Both lead to economic disasters. And in George W. Bush's case it was historic.

What's happening now is yet another stock market bubble is being created. And the companies not buying up their stocks...
81 2018-09-20 23:23:18 Stocks are bloated with corporate buy backs...
82 2018-09-20 23:23:11 Fuck that!! Yes! The stock market is doing well. Years of work went into that. Like Reagan taking credit for the freeing of the hostages. That's great for the people who can afford stocks! What about everyone else busting their asses everyday?
83 2018-09-20 23:22:55 That's not true. Many working class put money in 401k, investing in the market through funds, not buy particular stocks. The rising market floats all boats, get it?
84 2018-09-20 23:22:54 “I think it’s almost impossible if you’re to do well in equities over a period of time if you go to bed every night thinking about the price of them. I mean, Charlie and I, we think about the value of them.”  Warren Buffett

85 2018-09-20 23:22:43 He is into self preservation not principles and trade is where a president has tons of autonomy - regardless go read the ustr exclusion requests and short those names if you think this escalates because there is no way those stocks don’t get hurt badly
86 2018-09-20 23:22:37 So I know the pain but also I think through my thesis on stocks often. It's also why I rarely buy individual stocks (last 4 before this I sold at 100%+ gains but it was a strong market). Investing sucks basically :)

92 2018-09-20 23:19:48 Overall a very productive day in which I was able to complete 3 separate projects, get several invoices delivered, make a few stocks trades that I am optimistic about, and communicate with over 60 friends, colleagues, and clients. I will continue this trend into the evening.
93 2018-09-20 23:19:12 $NBEV up 80% today and 20% after hours . Some will get rich, more will get burned #stocks #options #cannabis $TLRY
94 2018-09-20 23:18:53 If you watch his 1hr interview with @cthagod Kanye spoke fully about how America forces us to always focus on the past to point where we (blacks) are completely out of the loop on the shit that can forward us....technology, economics, stocks etc. Shit these white peoples know now
95 2018-09-20 23:18:18 $cann wait is going to result in no sleep tonight.  #stocks
96 2018-09-20 23:18:08 Buying stocks actually fun lol
97 2018-09-20 23:17:45 never been so bored in my life
98 2018-09-20 23:17:40 I made $20 from stocks
99 2018-09-20 23:16:52 The stocks calling my name Bro.. we gon talk
100 2018-09-20 23:16:49 But also senate hearing wasn't atJuly 25 peak. Stocks were weak before on bad earnings while google earnings were good. It would be nice if more fact checking was done
101 2018-09-20 23:16:24 Comicbookrealm(dot)com is basically a stocks profile for just about any book out there. They price skyrocketed on there when that news was released

103 2018-09-20 23:14:47 Some perspective: the market cap of TLRY is 20B. If just 10% of that were put into $CRON, it would almost double the current price. Lots of money out there in #MJ stocks.
104 2018-09-20 23:14:26 #Wall Street delivered another set of milestones Thursday as a wave of buying sent U.S. stocks solidly higher, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the all-time high it closed at in January. The S&P 500, the benchmark for many index funds, also hit a new high, eclipsing
105 2018-09-20 23:12:12 No hace falta que actualices (aunque le dieron una lavadita de cara), es la misma app de stocks que esta desde hace 10 años
Respecto del precio, yo considero que ya estoy en el baile, vamos a bailar. Las compre más para long term pero lpm haberme imaginado que iban a bajar tanto
106 2018-09-20 23:10:54 All taxes and paid by labor and capital, and most taxes on corporate capital are paid by individual income taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains on corporate stocks and bonds.  Legal decision about filing as C & S-Corps are a distraction which the tax code created.
107 2018-09-20 23:10:09 Weed stocks are the new crypto
108 2018-09-20 23:10:05 That's terrific for the 1% that owns the vast majority of stocks.
109 2018-09-20 23:10:00 How is this different from cash? Any created currency would favor those who adopt and horde. That could be said about cash, stocks, real estate, etc. get in early and convince others to buy.
110 2018-09-20 23:09:28 People talking about pot stocks going beast mode right now and comparing it to the crypto craze in Dec of last year obviously weren’t paying attention. Pot stocks blew up last December too and crashed in late Jan. Just like crypto. Am I the only one noticing this?
111 2018-09-20 23:08:22 @thecatoutofthehat1 inverted hammer is the day candle and JHook is a groups of candle that make the pattern I am updating all my 189  stocks
112 2018-09-20 23:06:10 Any idea why DPWW is not following other marijuana stocks.
113 2018-09-20 23:05:59 US Stocks are at an all time high, along with job opportunities. Lowest unemployment for African Americans, Hispanics, teens, and women ever recorded. 

Why do Democrats hate @realDonaldTrump?
114 2018-09-20 23:05:45 Trade stocks
115 2018-09-20 23:05:11 Stat: 8 New Common Stocks made a new 52 week low today on the NYSE
116 2018-09-20 23:04:41 Congratulations to all the wealthy people buying those stocks.
117 2018-09-20 23:04:08 You might want to analyze bank stocks.  Biotechs don't trade on book value....
118 2018-09-20 23:03:25 The local government is corrupt plan and simple- be a journalist and dig I dare you. You’ll be dead in a week.
119 2018-09-20 23:03:12 Starting to feel a lot like '99. More S&P stocks making 52 week lows than highs
120 2018-09-20 23:02:46 Maybe Trump being president is his karmic punishment. Before he ran for the presidency, he was just another annoying celebrity who was on WWE that one time. Now he's one of the biggest laughing stocks and will probably end up in prison or dead sooner than expected. #Trump
121 2018-09-20 23:01:43 Okay, you mean I can learn about investing but not about  buying and selling stocks?
122 2018-09-20 23:01:03 @cvpayne  Hey Charles, I ordinarily like to stick with solid dividend paying stocks, but an OTCBB stock caught my eye & I wondered what you thought about Generation Next Franchise Brands, Inc. (VEND). Price: $1.60. Recent 52 week low was: $1.55 & it appears to be a solid company.
123 2018-09-20 23:00:46 I'm now a proud owner of stocks!
124 2018-09-20 23:00:31 Mr Payne, how do you feel about investing in real estate,  rather than stocks?

130 2018-09-20 22:57:20 This is a great post with the surge of weed stocks, but what's up with the picture of spruce tips 
131 2018-09-20 22:57:18 If you want to know how this ends check the charts for all the "crypto stocks" like $OSTK, $MARA, and $DPW. This will end the same way I guarantee it.
132 2018-09-20 22:57:12 “.. For the sizable portion of Americans who don't own homes or a substantial amount of stocks, the report only illustrates, yet again, that asset price inflation mostly benefits people who already own a sizable amount of assets..”

This was back in April and we still haven't got anything. Our stock with EPGL just disappeared w/TD Am. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks Rachelle Freda
144 2018-09-20 22:51:50 Did you not read what I tweeted? We’re not talking about shareholders. No one owns the stock market. Stocks are bought and traded everyday by the millions of transactions of non wealthy people.

151 2018-09-20 22:48:53 @cvpayne : bottom fishing...sounds good Charles.  Looking great tonight.  Any thoughts on Cannabis stocks?
152 2018-09-20 22:47:56 Buy stocks and mutual funds that are American.  Stay away from foreign emerging markets etc. Trump is pro American biz and will be here 6 more years.
153 2018-09-20 22:47:55 Yeah I mean. Without a percentage I can't tell you. However crypto went up 16x last year before people sold, stocks go up 10-12% a year, commodities, in the past, bonds and businesses and coin colllections. 
Your not adding value. The demand relative to the currency has increased

161 2018-09-20 22:42:31 Pot stocks running like crypto stocks did a while ago. Remember RIOT exploded to 30s. This is the sector to keep focus on for coming weeks and months.
162 2018-09-20 22:42:21 I think the unfortunate thing is that a lot of people(small new traders)are stuck over $200 in this pig, and now are hoping to get some of their loses back on another rally Experienced traders @CitronResearch know that's 99.9% unlikely and it will like other stocks continue down
163 2018-09-20 22:42:18 Stock market hits record highs on strong economy and earnings. US in a great place and the SandP 500 isn't overvalued. Hard not to like stocks in here.
164 2018-09-20 22:42:12 $NVCN The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend @Neovasc #Dow
165 2018-09-20 22:41:51 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? You have done nothing to make anyone safe. Three separate shootings in 24 hours. Are you afraid of the @NRA?”

180 2018-09-20 22:35:43 Stocks are high cause all the rich are buying back stocks because of the tax breaks Trump gave them and himself! Stocks always rise when tax breaks come into play!! But look how it’s adding onto the deficit and national debt!

200 2018-09-20 22:26:29 During the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. #HIST12007F18

Patience a virtue, especially now in markets that simply have no concept of the word.  


223 2018-09-20 22:19:54 There are people that still have bump stocks - that was an act of terrorism. No one likes you, this will be poorly attended and you will lie about how many people are there.
224 2018-09-20 22:18:39 We’ve been losing since January. We just clawed back through Trump’s war on stocks.
225 2018-09-20 22:18:17 I’m mostly just gonna be investing into index funds for now, just because I don’t feel confident doing individual stocks, and I don’t have a whole lotta money to invest in individual stocks. Index funds will be less risk, less return, but still light years better than banks.

231 2018-09-20 22:15:59 Get some cannabis stocks before they're all gone.  I was fortunate enough to pick up a stake in #auroracannabis on #RobinHood while they were still available.   $ACBFF $CRON $CGC
232 2018-09-20 22:15:58 When you both grew up together and conversations went from being about matching outfits to which stocks we’re investing in >>>
233 2018-09-20 22:15:45 $mu we should ahve done this. short 3000 stocks above 48 as anyway it would have consolidated after move from 40. add to more short another 3000 when it went red 44.9 and cover all 6000 at 42.8 = close to 25000 profits in 10 minutes @GarySMorrow
234 2018-09-20 22:15:17 Not at all, since there is a direct correlation between wages and hiring. If businesses are forced to pay higher wages, they hire fewer workers. If money is so readily available bc stocks rise, as you alleged, why stop wage increases that benefit groups who are not the top 10%?
235 2018-09-20 22:14:29 The headline suggests that is not normal......People with more money tend to invest more in stocks and therefore get the benefits of a market rise and conversely lose money in a market downturn if stocks are sold.
236 2018-09-20 22:13:54 It's a penny stock... They will perpetually lose money and dilute shareholders like 99% of penny stocks. It's not a "scam" per say, it's just a garbage company.

242 2018-09-20 22:12:20 You are still wrong, since your claim was "when stocks drop, companies lay off, but when they flourish, they hire". That sounds like an absolute statement. I stay consistent, and on message, which benefits my students, and now you. Try again.
243 2018-09-20 22:12:14 His only real team comp is with Fox. Ness' role is to play support and tank stocks. Against floaties you can find lots of heal setups, but against spacies it's important the Ness plays disruptively and cycles their recoveries offstage for 2v1's.
244 2018-09-20 22:11:54 weed stocks will be some of the greatest shorts of our time..most who have invested will not realize their bulk shares in time & let human emotions overwhelm discipline, as someone w/ interests still in the space i feel the time will come sooner than later, invest accordingly

247 2018-09-20 22:10:28 I think a money contraction would hit Tesla stronger than other stocks. First, they don't have profits but lots of debt that has to be refinanced. Second, the bagholders. When those sheeps will start panicking, they'll do it all at once. They are "weak hands"

258 2018-09-20 22:06:05 I should have bought stocks in @Kleenex 
259 2018-09-20 22:06:00 @MadMoneyOnCNBC has their screaming gearshift of a host orgating over big bank stocks. I'm trying not to punch things. 

Cc @rhcm123
260 2018-09-20 22:05:57 @stocks_n_blondes @TurnerTime 1.94 average on the strangle
261 2018-09-20 22:05:28 There's a reason Trump is so calm about this. Kavanaugh has a big surprise waiting for the #Pedocrats when it's his turn to talk. They will have so much egg on their faces. They'll be laughing stocks throughout this country.
262 2018-09-20 22:05:16 Weed stocks
263 2018-09-20 22:05:06 Canadian marijuana stocks are overvalued, because they are still just commodities, Sean Stiefel, founder and cannabis portfolio manager of Navy Capital, told CNBC on Wednesday.
264 2018-09-20 22:04:55 @stocks_n_blondes @TurnerTime should make a descent gain if this holds but that was the only safe way I knew to play this
265 2018-09-20 22:04:22 @stocks_n_blondes @TurnerTime I bought 10 45.5 puts and 10 48calls both expiring tomorrow total spent was 1900$
266 2018-09-20 22:03:59 You're an idiot if you only think people who own stock are benefiting. 
When stocks drop. Companies lay off. When they flourish... they hire.
Stock market does NOT mean "only good for people with stocks".
267 2018-09-20 22:03:58 nbev ah 8.62 was 3.35 yesterday
268 2018-09-20 22:01:40 Donte I missed he part when you became a mexican that grew up in mexico and tried to to use your pesos and flip them to make US dollars by investing in stocks without coming to the states and getting deported. Because if you did all that you need a movie
269 2018-09-20 21:59:56 i bought many cannabis stocks months ago but ignored tilray because it has risen quickly after the İPO thought it would go cheaper
270 2018-09-20 21:59:53 My Canadian weed stocks are boomin

277 2018-09-20 21:58:16 I'm gonna start investing in stocks and drive for uber. .
278 2018-09-20 21:58:13 Has he also shared how much he benefits from the rise in those stocks?
279 2018-09-20 21:57:33 Funny! Just saw that on TV regarding marijuana stocks.
280 2018-09-20 21:57:28 Except, you know, stocks, bonds, real estate, an education, etc., etc. What a dopey tag line.
281 2018-09-20 21:56:41 Yes...getting there. U stocks always lag U spot price. John Quakes charts show continuous upward movement in that parameter. The bigger private investors will start to pile in followed by hedge funds then the pension funds and folks will all wonder why U is increasing.
282 2018-09-20 21:56:15 I gave random Reddit users a real $20 of my own money to invest in the stock market (penny stocks) and they've already turned my $20 into $30.51 in just a month. That is an insane ROI in a little amount of time. Might be onto something there. #MarbleExperiment
283 2018-09-20 21:56:08 @stocks_n_blondes also computers are becoming a necessity. The device ur using right now probably has a micron chip in it. Don’t b ignorant
284 2018-09-20 21:55:51 And thats great news for the minority of the country who own stocks; now, how about addressing the flat (when compared with inflation) rate of wage growth that affects the overwhelming majority of the country. Oh, I forgot, you only care for the top 1%; my apologies.
285 2018-09-20 21:54:01 Comme le sang contaminé la priorité étant d'écouler les stocks !
286 2018-09-20 21:53:53 @stocks_n_blondes you don’t know much about electronics do you... nearly Every electronic “commodity” you own uses micron chips FYI
287 2018-09-20 21:53:01 MaxVal-u specials available in stores....starting today until Monday 24/09/18 or while stocks last!!
288 2018-09-20 21:52:56 There’s no denying Blake’s mechanics aren’t good. Ask Greg cosell. He’s a football guy. He will tell you the same. But it’s just like stocks. One above scenario it wouldn’t be automatically a or c. Much more to it than that. I watch more football because of Fantasy.
289 2018-09-20 21:52:32 The guy who stocks the vending machine at my office. You can’t just put Grippos in A3 for 4 years and then one day just switch them to A7. I got Baked Lays. Awful.

291 2018-09-20 21:51:46 Konti lang stocks nyo... Gone in 60 seconds...  Ang tagal ng availability ng MAC lipstick ni Maine kasi na-delay pa ang launching... We are expecting more stocks sana... 
292 2018-09-20 21:51:42 Why do they make it seem so crazy that you’ve been bullish stocks when they’ve been in uptrends. Wouldn’t it be crazy if you haven’t been bullish?
293 2018-09-20 21:51:19 I mean.. just buy anything and it just goes up right?  ETF’s just pumping more money into stocks daily and people just adding on when they can. Trade wars maybe a concern but people love trends more. Rinse. Wash. Repeat.
294 2018-09-20 21:51:07 Thank you, yes.  And they wonder why we closed our accounts, sold our stocks, and started protesting. #CultureOfCorruption

296 2018-09-20 21:49:18 Jyp gotta increase those stocks somehow i guess 
297 2018-09-20 21:48:39 Are you adding any more stocks?
298 2018-09-20 21:48:28 Target actually stocks this?
299 2018-09-20 21:47:33 @stocks_n_blondes because it is not just a commodity it is a necessity for electronics. Arguably the most important component.
300 2018-09-20 21:47:13 @DSStockTrader im not great at analyzing penny stocks, i look for over extended stocks and base the price vs fair value.
301 2018-09-20 21:45:45 thanks--im also at a record High today if my calculations are correct--Experts say to stick with stocks is the best way to grow assets--  market timers often lose--Black rock Larry Fink says to stay in stocks and dont time
302 2018-09-20 21:45:11 Additionally, ICOs are raising far less and far fewer ICOs are being raised than in the last 18 months. Coins are being found out. Investors realising its a bubble when they see cannabis stocks
303 2018-09-20 21:44:46 Just thinking there was actually a lengthy period from when Amazon was shutting down bookstores left and right to the point where they are now (sneezing in a direction and stocks lose 5% of value). 

Lots of execution in there.
304 2018-09-20 21:43:59 Enjoy your tax cuts enjoy your jobs enjoy your freedom's cause if democrats take back the house and the Senate they are going to raise are taxes take away jobs and open the border stocks Will plumit so vote republican so we can keep things I track
305 2018-09-20 21:43:48 stocks rise by 1%.
306 2018-09-20 21:43:28 lol. What percentage of your idiotic worshippers even own stocks? #FoolishDon
307 2018-09-20 21:43:13 FACTS: Democrats did NOT add $77B to the deficit within ONE year. Democrats did NOT offer farmers $12B bailout for trade wars. Democrats did NOT offer big tax cuts to corporations who laid off workers, relocated, or reinvested into their stocks. GOP did.

#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
308 2018-09-20 21:42:44 My understanding is that you divided the stocks for each days, so we have chance to get it yet. Is it correct?
309 2018-09-20 21:41:57 There's an adjustment coming. Or, November could send stocks tumbling if #BlueWave2018 takes over!
310 2018-09-20 21:40:52 Need something to be happy about? 

It's been 7 days since Cube announced that Hyuna and Hyojong would be kicked out of the company, the Cube's stocks are still dropping today. :)

312 2018-09-20 21:40:31 That’s just great. Too bad my fucking taxes went up and I can no longer afford to buy stocks like I did under Obama, Bush, and Clinton.
313 2018-09-20 21:40:26 Shit thing popped on good #s now dn 1.5 on guide dn. Most stocks are tough rides we make money but the rides seem treacherous. Example ABBV, BABA, Gild, MU, FB

319 2018-09-20 21:36:31 Nobody knows if the stocks going to go up, down, sideways or in fucking circles, least of all stockbrokers.

329 2018-09-20 21:30:31 A question for all experts...

If situation is getting better as they shows:
- Stocks
- EM situation (TRY, ZAR, MXN... far away from the lows)
- Yields near highs
- Italy getting better
- Brexit headlines suggesting a final deal
- Safe heaven as JPY being sold
Why is CHF so bid??

331 2018-09-20 21:30:09 I agree.  But largely unfettered access by most people to a very large variety of weapons will never help either.  The NRA wont even agree to the banning of bump stocks.  There is a huge divide here with no one willing to compromise at any level.
332 2018-09-20 21:29:23 And the top 10% own more than 84% of the stocks.

 STOCKS RECORD HIGH     #Winning
336 2018-09-20 21:27:56 MIRACLE MARKET;  Stocks at record highs is odd. Historically when  there was a big increase in oil prices, or a big increase in interest rates, or a big decline in China stock market (down almost 20% since 1/1/18), stocks in USA declined.  We have all three.  What happens next?

338 2018-09-20 21:25:13 DOW  up 251,,,NAZ 78, a wonderful day, stocks pretty much across the board were bought, a positive signal for more gains ahead. Trade War anxiety seems to have cooled somewhat, warranted or not. When money is put in my hand, I say thank you.
339 2018-09-20 21:24:16 @shaunattwood what books did you read which helped you learn about stocks in the beginning?
340 2018-09-20 21:24:14 I very much doubt folks making minimum wage own any stocks.
341 2018-09-20 21:23:33 My stocks have been tripping all week.
342 2018-09-20 21:22:29 Well-to-do people don't buy low risk stocks. Why? Because they are too above us
343 2018-09-20 21:22:17 Nike stocks at all time high 
344 2018-09-20 21:21:51 Upward pressure on stocks seems to have grown as more and more credit has been created, float has decreased, and bonds continue to perform poorly. Seems unlikely any of these will be changing soon. Trump's distractions create a useful source of headwinds in this environment, imo.
345 2018-09-20 21:20:54 New higs/new low:  the focus could be shifting away from previous leaders? Beaten down stocks comming back at the front lines?
346 2018-09-20 21:20:51 Lol. Its easy maths.... stocks fall for the visionaries to aquire as many as possible and for the panicked to sell as quickly as possible.... equation balanced.

352 2018-09-20 21:19:57 When I used to trade penny stocks in the early 1800’s, we had an old saying, “SEC this dick” then we dumped are holdings and cashed out to go fishing in the sewers of NYC!
353 2018-09-20 21:19:43 Index funds and Target retirement funds. Picking individual stocks is a fool's game
354 2018-09-20 21:19:42 Scientists have revealed bass mortality in U.K. waters was not 15% in 2017 but 5%. As a result bass stocks increased. Good old scientists. Almost goosed a recreation industry because the can't do decimals.
355 2018-09-20 21:18:19 Top 10% by wealth own 80%+ of all stocks via various vehicles.  So if they get caught in a correction it's no more Trumps fault than the rise is all Trump's doing.  Blame the advisors that are chasing the market.

359 2018-09-20 21:15:41 At least drunk me put money into my stocks instead of buying something stupid... 
360 2018-09-20 21:15:16 I think a lot of people have some buy into the stock markets with their IRA's, 401ks and their company retirement programs. Many individuals do not invest in particular stocks but they do invest in mutual funds and those mutual funds are invested in stocks.

369 2018-09-20 21:09:42 i'm still neutral on the USD here.  I could see US stocks, EM, and commodities all go up. For the short term, I think that's how it will play out.  For 2019, idk.
370 2018-09-20 21:09:28 I’m not knocking crypto or weed stocks in this post. Anything could be an amazing or awful investment it’s mainly about the timing.
371 2018-09-20 21:08:41 I know a total 2 people on the entire planet who own stocks.  One is worth $9 mil, the other worth $20 mil.  So, thanks.  Idiot.
372 2018-09-20 21:08:24 Today's Market = Gas on the Fire

Markets kept up positive momentum today, with green numbers across the board, and a fresh new all time high on the S&P. Tech stocks charged ahead with investors hungry for more risk. Is this the start of another big run?

S&P 500: 2,930.75

431 2018-09-20 20:45:06 Not a Bernie guy.  Never have been.  The socialism I’m talking about is the gift for the 1% to buy back stocks.  What about the socialism gift to farmers that Trump hurt with his tariffs.  I know it’s the new buzz word the GOP is trying to use because they have nothing else.
432 2018-09-20 20:44:15 Nah... that’s a targeted 0 correlation fund. I like beta. There are some new ETFs based on the concept. $PTLC is one that’s plain vanilla US stocks. $VMOT (shout out) is one that will have higher T.E. I think basic 12 month trend vs 60/40 is the cleanest for comparison reasons.

439 2018-09-20 20:41:12 I doubt weed stocks will trigger a depression, it depends on how many have invested, but in a few weeks or months when profits don't roll in folks will start to sell and the price will collapse to its natural value. Likely by year end. Definitely within a few months.

Stocks were higher on Thursday with investors waving off trade war threats and focusing on the latest, positive economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 climbed to all-time highs. #Cities929
452 2018-09-20 20:34:12 World stocks generally surged higher: US +.8%; Europe +.7%. Investors hopes for easing trade tensions combined with expected strong 3Q earnings put them in a buying mood. Market getting expensive again but if smooth sailing on all fronts it could continue moving up for some time.

476 2018-09-20 20:24:11 I was thinking that might be a possibility too, but then didn't see same thing happening in other GCL held stocks so don't think so.  GCL doesn't hold much Cameco and they were strong today too.  Cheers!
477 2018-09-20 20:24:01 Listened to recent @RBIPodcast, and decided to test the goal of 60% stocks beating the market...of the 57 companies in which I invest, I have beaten the market with 32 of them. Thanks @DavidGFool! Been a SA member since I was 16, and the annual fee pales to the gains I've made!
478 2018-09-20 20:23:40 Okay @AppleSupport I have an iPad. Why does the update treat my iPad like an iPhone X with gestures? I don't have a notch so why is my time and weirdly, date in the top left corner of my screen? Stop treating iPads like an iPhone. I don't need a stocks app I need a calculator.
479 2018-09-20 20:23:27 Yea their stocks are still going up even though they haven’t made profit. Investors are pulling for the company to succeed
480 2018-09-20 20:23:23 It wasn’t a coincidence that the next bubble was in seemingly safe assets (mortgages, CDOs, banks). Lesson was learned about risky tech stocks, but there is always a blind spot.

485 2018-09-20 20:20:47 With Dow and S&P 500 at new highs, here are YTD index gains:

Nasdaq 100  +18.3%
Nasdaq +16.3
Russell 2000 +12.0
S&P 500 +9.6
Dow transports +8.5
Dow 30 +7.8
S&P midcap +7.6

So non-tech blue chips still have some catching-up to do. Midcap stocks, too.
486 2018-09-20 20:20:37 No pro portfolio manager should buy stocks with sales of $28 million just because they are in a sexy industry. We tell our clients that we will miss 100% of stocks like this; in exchange, we don't have things like crypto that lose 98% of their value in 6 months. It's a trade off.

491 2018-09-20 20:19:05 More and more I’m coming to realize the main thing many lack and the hardest to master is patience. Stocks will do what they want when they are ready to, can’t force your will on the price so why agonize over range bound action. Wait for a breakout or stop out on a breakdown.

521 2018-09-20 20:09:04 Dear CT,

I know where the dumb money went. Dumb money is in pot stocks right now. It’s your job to convince them to come back.

522 2018-09-20 20:08:31 Dow leaps 251 points to close at an all-time high. It’s the first record for the Dow in eight months and the 100th since President Donald Trump’s election, reports CNN.  Nasdaq jumps 1% as tech stocks rally. GE falls 3% after disclosing a glitch with a major gas turbine.
523 2018-09-20 20:07:57 Hope that 4% bought stocks then with their bonus... sounds like that would be the smart idea
524 2018-09-20 20:07:33 Waste to energy plants to deal with the huge stocks of plastics and rubber tires could be set up and run to generate power. When I say we can be a renewable energy superpower, it means we would be the hub of technology development to advance these opportunities on a massive scale
525 2018-09-20 20:07:01 So why did it go up so fast? stocks were normal, the weather is normal,..... I don't understand.

Hi Timothy,

There's been a lot of hype around big pot stocks like Tilray and Canopy recently but some of this surge has trickled down to smaller but notable players.

---they almost all start like that before making their pitch
530 2018-09-20 20:05:45 @StockGodd I have been finding a little time to trade at work and after work.  I am always looking for stocks that fit the One cent spread strategy. How are you guys doing?

547 2018-09-20 20:00:07 Bummer. Presumably you’ve tried wide/narrow/soft footbed variations? (Or maybe not worth it. I don’t even know who in Seattle stocks a good selection after MJ Feet closed.)

550 2018-09-20 19:59:43 Do think that China's stocks down 20% this year has anything to do with their now reversal (remains to be seen, but is the current belief) on the tariff war with US? @mungowitz
551 2018-09-20 19:59:06 This move in $VIX is quite eye catching...if you can't can't bring yourself to chase cannabis stocks, might as well buy up OTM index calls and push up implieds via the spec buying route
552 2018-09-20 19:58:16 From @themotleyfool -- AT&T CEO Randall L. Stephenson says Netflix is the Walmart of video streaming, while his company's HBO is the Tiffany's. Sounds like a sore loser to me. #stocks
553 2018-09-20 19:58:14 Cash flow. Results are still lousy. Wait until Q3 when some bigger numbers show up. Although Canada producers gushed FCF in Q2 and you can't give our shares away. At least we have cannabis stocks to support our market- our version of tech. Also, who is in the index?

558 2018-09-20 19:56:32 I have the same view. Most stocks will make you money when Uranium starts to move but some will make you ALOT of money....just like Paladin did in the last run up.
559 2018-09-20 19:56:05 tax breaks for the wealthy locked up in stocks, not trickling down to low income.if u really want to fire the economy give tax breaks to low income earners and raise min Wage.

664 2018-09-20 19:18:01 It does happen really quickly. Producers and potential producers are highly leveraged to the price of U3O8 so when it goes up the related stocks experience explosive gains. U3O8 goes up fast because paying a high price beats running out and shutting down your plant.

671 2018-09-20 19:15:06 It doesn't take much money to profit from stocks though. People are just intimidated about playing the stock market and were never taught how to do it.
672 2018-09-20 19:14:56 Go into the details of the crazy valuations these stocks are trading at.
673 2018-09-20 19:14:52 Have to be impressed with how well these #MJ stocks are holding up in spite of some strong selling in $TLRY. Lots of green out there! VERY impressive.
674 2018-09-20 19:14:46 Agreed. Trumps rising tide is raising all boats. Lowest unemployment ever for latinos, blacks, and women. Stocks are going up. Consumer confidence is soaring.

677 2018-09-20 19:13:34 What's happening today is not new. Extreme monetary policy (such as 15 trillion QE), pushes up all assets (RE, bonds, stocks..) -> the rich own these -> increases inequality -> increases social unrest -> increases populism -> prepares next disaster. #crisis #policies #prudence
678 2018-09-20 19:13:26 When you're learning about #trading & have some wins, you will probably feel euphoric & invincible. 
Don't let those feelings affect your judgement for the next trade.

715 2018-09-20 18:57:28 Sam I’m curious if you’ve looked at cannabis stocks? Some of them are just overvalued. Other I’ve looked at might have a fake product or they are simply a blank check company. Wondering what your experience might tell about these new companies with fat valuations with no revenue

788 2018-09-20 18:27:41 My TJX calls went south, is it still a good buy resetting my trade to long stocks ?
789 2018-09-20 18:27:29 There is news. The world middle class (mostly China and India) is growing for many years now. They are both a market to many companies and it also means they have retirement accounts which hold US stocks mostly indirectly. This trend alone expands P/E
790 2018-09-20 18:26:57 If you don't understand how the wealthy benefits drastically more from the stock market than you don't know the game. As a former Broker, I can tell you first hand on how the sheep gets swindled out of hard earned money buying stocks and funds recommended by their Advisors
791 2018-09-20 18:25:59 There are always traders who believe some stocks can escape gravity. We call them bagholders. Lol
792 2018-09-20 18:24:54 I'm more interested in trading stocks, options and forex. I also got into investing in cryptocurrencies last year. 

Unfortunately I've had a very emotionally rough year and my attention/focus has been on getting through this rough patch.
793 2018-09-20 18:24:50 My wife asked me to buy some pot stocks on Monday. I asked why and she said they are shooting up so fast we could make money. I laughed and said that it's time to sell. She looked at me weird and I said if you have noticed anything about a stock its to late to buy. Lol
794 2018-09-20 18:24:43 I heard QE is coming from ECB from other fintweeters. But stocks can be safer than bonds or fiat currency without any policy changes, so I can’t own puts w/o owning puts on the dollar & 30yr as well.

801 2018-09-20 18:21:46 Hey, I actually have a consultation service for a small one-time fee of $15 if you’re interested.

Included is an introduction to the stock market, what and when to buy/sell particular stocks, effective ways to manage your stock portfolio as well as budget plans.

811 2018-09-20 18:17:10 What dim bulb Wendy doesn't realize is that the top 1% own 81% of all stocks, so the stock market is a false measure of growth for the average American.  Oh, and Wendy dear, sorry you're so sensitive...too bad assault and rape don't push your buttons.

821 2018-09-20 18:13:50 Tons of new smart-crap from Amazon and their stock still isn't getting up to where it was an hour before the announcements. No where near where it was beginning of the month, either. I have no idea how stocks work lol
822 2018-09-20 18:13:47 apple stocks rise by 30%.
823 2018-09-20 18:13:28 Stocks will certainly sink in 6 months. Every illegal dispensary is going underground with online purchasing. If the price is any higher than 6$ per gram you’ll loose big time and all the criminals will gain a foothold. Good luck!
824 2018-09-20 18:13:01 I agree ..I think this market is difficult to play but it does tend to reward lowly rated stocks with growth catalysts ...rather than highly rated well documented growth stories

829 2018-09-20 18:11:44 The irony of Americans making money off Canadian cannabis stocks but still don't want Universal Health Care in their own country...

835 2018-09-20 18:07:41 gas prices are manipulated and not by supply and demand, interest rates are going up as wage inflation goes up, housing, stocks, the value of our dollar all up, the gov’t $50B/mo. subsidy for Mtg.securities down to $10B under this administration...these are all significant
836 2018-09-20 18:07:18 261 mass shootings this year! GOP & Trump do nothing! No gun control, no stoppage of bump stocks, no limits on repeat of guns, no change in age, no national registration for guns or ammunition! Prayers- r too easy! Vote GOP out of office!

841 2018-09-20 18:06:21 Stock market looks great after corporate buy backs.  All stocks prove is hedge fund manages and CEOs r getting richer.  Jobs haven’t “come back” folks are having to settle for less due to lack of high paying jobs.
842 2018-09-20 18:05:49 Trump is too young to be @POTUS 

Extremely inexperienced!

He doesn't understand ordinary Americans don't hold many stocks but they need to drive to work so high oil price is worse for them. Trump never needs to drive to work. He lives in the same building as his workplace.
843 2018-09-20 18:05:47 Why do you think he’s going to roll it back.  So you are playing the “What if” too.  What exactly, within text, did he say that references that?  I watch all the hearing and can’t seem to remember it.  And BTW, what Nancy Pelossi and Maxine Watters did regarding stocks was illega

846 2018-09-20 18:04:36 Up $70 from last week. Still -370 overall. Hoping for a big run in December again so I can sell and allocate that $800 to actual stocks. 
847 2018-09-20 18:04:17 Yes this will be true post-hyperbitcoinization. It will make sense to invest in companies which stocks are denominated in btc and produce btc dividends.

In the meantime it makes more sense to buy btc to benefit from the hyperbitcoinization singularity.
848 2018-09-20 18:03:51 Marijuana Stocks! Have stock in Aurora, & since Coke announced they may buy or partner with them, it’s up $10+ in a week!

851 2018-09-20 18:02:31 "These jobs won't came back folks, Trump will need a magic wand for them to come back."

"you can't expect more of a growth than 2%" 

"The stocks will crash once Trump is elected"

"Trump's economy will leave people dead"

879 2018-09-20 17:52:18 So stocks may not fall immediately but won't go high too much. Tariffs and inflation will be real. Interest rate will go high. Debt will go high. Oil goes high too if economy and stocks don't fall. So we r stuck. I don't know how Trump can get reelected in this mess.

952 2018-09-20 17:25:44 @APompliano In 2008 economic crisis, while all investors were selling stocks @WarrenBuffett was buying hard, because he said "A simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful". Cryptohaters that's why we say #HODL.

965 2018-09-20 17:21:46 I don't think anyone wants a total ban, but tighter regulations on how to legally buy and sell guns, tighter regs on the type of gun that can be legally bought, and tighter regs on how guns can be modified with eg bump stocks.

993 2018-09-20 17:14:15 Actually, last February, Donald Trump stated the Congress was scared of the NRA, and there was no reason we needed bump stocks. The following week, he met with the NRA, and the subject was dropped and never brought up again.

1025 2018-09-20 17:05:16 One shooting was done with a bump stock, but just so you know the NRA and Trump have agreed bump stocks should be banned.
1026 2018-09-20 17:04:21 I mean pot stocks!!! 
1027 2018-09-20 17:03:54 Perhaps no single person has ever said those words out loud in that order... but based on the actions of groups like the NRA, that is clearly the goal. Bump-stocks turn semi-automatics into guns that mimic automatic weapons. People will break laws.

لكن لا أحد يتحدث عن إنهيار
.
ملاحظة
التراجع إذا تخطى 30% يعد إنهيار جزئي
1037 2018-09-20 17:01:18 @kurteichenwald with stocks hitting yet another record high today, how huge of a mistake was it to sell all the stocks in your childrens college funds when @POTUS was elected?
1038 2018-09-20 17:01:17 And while we’re on this subject. We need to ban bump stocks. There is absolutely no use for them.
1039 2018-09-20 17:01:11 Time to check your stocks. #ncpol

1048 2018-09-20 16:59:33 That helps you. I could use a hand with my prescriptions. $1,200 a month, and I have "good insurance." Since your stocks are doing so well, want to help a commoner out?

1050 2018-09-20 16:59:29 With the stocks hitting another record high today, I'd ask @kurteichenwald if selling all his childrens stock in their college funds when Trump won was a good idea.  But being a coward leftist, he has me blocked.  #MAGA
1051 2018-09-20 16:59:23 Yes, I'm in it for the long haul. Some of us got in for speculation and then they were forced to hodl or capitulate. I know this is akin to the stocks in the 90's, so I really don't mind holding for a decade or so.
1052 2018-09-20 16:59:18 I don't think investors realize that $IBM just addressed the biggest problem in modern AI! Which is to "check for and mitigate bias in AI". #stocks $IBM #investing #stocktwits
1053 2018-09-20 16:58:58 Just had an epiphany and realized that I’ve treated all my past relationships like stocks...I’d invest into them, until they started to drop and did more harm than benefit...then I’d just cash out and look for a new one to invest into...I need help...or do I?

1061 2018-09-20 16:58:04 Not sure I understand the question. Is it that if I thought stocks wouldn’t relatively frequently (i.e. in my lifetime) have the potential to have 20% drawdowns (let alone 30-50%+ drawdowns) would I no longer bother with trend? If so, then yes. Much less likely.

1065 2018-09-20 16:56:49 That moment when you do real stock but you can only sell stocks 3 times a week. Rip money.
1066 2018-09-20 16:55:34 I feel your pain. Finding that I'm in the right stocks that soar on updates only to give most back over the following weeks. Last year prices would kick on following good updates. It's a strange market atm with low volumes not helping
1067 2018-09-20 16:55:27 The way crude related stocks have sold off... don't think oil is coming down sooner n y wud America want oil prices to come down...they themselves r pumping it big time n exporting

1072 2018-09-20 16:53:23 How will you survive without the new version of the Stocks app and all the news it fills the screen with instead of showing me more of the tickers I want to see?
1073 2018-09-20 16:53:18 Dow jumps 250 points today while the S&P 500 gains .78% to 2930, easily moving above and past the 2900 level. Stocks are gaining strength while bonds are weakening and you can read that as “risk on!” Best ideas for the next few months: Industrials, Finance & Health Care
1074 2018-09-20 16:53:11 @ScottWapnerCNBC last week Jon  said the only stock he owned was AAPL now you he says he owns the pot stocks what gives
1075 2018-09-20 16:52:52 Some people who don't invest their money in stocks seem to care very little that the market is booming. They have to be reminded that their Union pensions and their 401K's ARE invested in the market and their richness depends on it growing.

1080 2018-09-20 16:51:11 Are members of the NRA considered mainstream gun owners, because that is certainly their platform. Everyone who wants a gun has a right to one w/o restriction. Mythical laws? Ban the sale of bump-stocks/weapons modifications? Closing the gun-show loophole.
1081 2018-09-20 16:50:55 My stocks headed in the right path
1082 2018-09-20 16:50:21 Yeah, that’s a general market risk for all stocks, particularly high growth multiple tech valuations but not specific to Tesla and I “hope” not as near-term as the Tesla specific risk factors. You’re right, though. It would have the same effect

1087 2018-09-20 16:49:33 A significant proportion of these vendors carry trading stocks worth more than $5k, sold from car trunks. These grocery items or clothing are sold in front of supermarkets, boutiques, etc. This class of people can afford to rent a shop if they want

1094 2018-09-20 16:47:18 Trump impacts us in many ways, which is why we are justified in expressing our feelings about him. E.g. his tariffs will cost Canadians their jobs, anyone holding U.S. stocks in their RRSPs are impacted (positively) by his Corp tax cuts, etc.

1101 2018-09-20 16:45:11 Stock buybacks to hit $1T this year, the highest ever by far! Companies (who were already at record profits) got a $2T debt funded tax cut and used it all to juice their stocks, rather than reward their workers. Sad!
1102 2018-09-20 16:44:45 "nearly all of the stock ownership in the U.S. is concentrated among  the richest. The top 20 percent of Americans  owned 92 percent of the stocks in 2013.   Put another way: Eighty percent of Americans together owned just 8 percent of all stocks."
1103 2018-09-20 16:43:40 When the "magic wand" you've used to juice stocks and
GDP numbers is HUGE NEW DEFICITS from the party of "fiscal responsibility". That's how much they hated Obama, they forced huge
deficit reductions which slowed recovery (hurt people), until Trump gets credit.

1115 2018-09-20 16:40:00 #Stocks are getting a boost after news broke that #China may be reducing its average tariffs on trading partners. They want to lower costs for Chinese consumers. There is pressure for China to come back and settle a deal with the US.
1116 2018-09-20 16:39:29 AAPL TSLA MSFT GOOGL AMZN are all good stocks to trade they have good movement. TSLA I think in a good case is going to be bought but more likely going out of business. GM and F I know first hand are putting up resources and capital to bring in automation. TSLA can’t survive
1117 2018-09-20 16:39:03 He mean that EOD there r top gainer and top looser stocks which moves the best rite? If we trade those from start of the day we will gain the most. So is it possible to check in preopen or one day earlier which will be tmros top gainer and looser stock of the day ?
1118 2018-09-20 16:38:37 Im not touching $TLRY till that hits a 23 or more % sell off for the day! $160 - $150 looks pretty good. These shares are hot people BE CAREFUL. Don't get burned !  #economics #finances #stocks

Border security? NOKO talks? MSM obfuscates successes
1128 2018-09-20 16:36:20 There are a lot of Wall street experts, such as Jeff Gundlach & Carl Icahn saying the same thing. Also, Trump has said he isn't into stocks. I am not an expert, that's why others manage my investments, this is just MHO. Hopefully it won't happen, took me years to recoup from 2008

1152 2018-09-20 16:29:36 Bank stocks are waking up after hibernating this year. With leading banks like $JPM and $BAC overcapitalized and repatriating capital with massive stock buybacks and sharp dividend increases, they stand to be positive contributors through year end. We own $JPM and $BAC.

1155 2018-09-20 16:29:11 Right, casino stocks down when economy is doing well. There's no consensus as to why business is in a slump, but expect Q3 to be a doozy. Except for Circus Circus, which is making money hand over fist (because value).

1158 2018-09-20 16:28:19 I'm up for the old fashioned methods.

Tower Hill, in the stocks, fresh fruit thrown etc. etc. etc.

Once a week until nobody turns up should just about cover it.
1159 2018-09-20 16:27:59 j'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,

Que tu me dises que c'est rien

I'm always weary of chat rooms pumping penny stocks, to only see them crash after

1179 2018-09-20 16:21:55 Isn’t this the play book for beginning stages of inflation? Stocks rise as hedge and rates rise. At some point the will be negatively correlated but probably not until we at least get to 3.5% Fed rates.
1180 2018-09-20 16:21:53 how many is your limited stocks? exactly 12midnight nasa cart na ako tapos unavailable na agad?

1182 2018-09-20 16:21:32 Ilan lang ba stocks nyo bakit out of stock agad in just a few minutes? Lima lng po b? Sabi nyo ready kayo? Tsk...
1183 2018-09-20 16:21:31 Agree... though many institutions have (in theory) decreased strategic  % weight to stocks and/or US stocks
1184 2018-09-20 16:21:26 I’m always delighted when it happens as it feels like I’ve got a free lunch

Next month is looking like a monster month for incoming dividends..nearly 1% of portfolio value...I still think the market habitually undervalues smaller hefty dividend paying stocks..which is nice
1185 2018-09-20 16:21:22 Hay, yung iba yung inis ko n nde ako nakabili ng lipstick @lazadaPH ilan lang b stocks nyo? #mainedcmMACLazada
1186 2018-09-20 16:21:21 Burbuja, lamentablemente. Después de 10 años de inyecciones al sistema a tasa 0, ahora tenemos burbujas por todos lados, bitcoin, shitcoins, ahora potstocks, stocks tocando límites absurdos... la caída va a ser fuerte :S
1187 2018-09-20 16:21:16 Aren't you the one who said "It's  Bubble" regarding the stock market?  So it's a bubble when Obama was in office but NOT when you are?  Hypocrite.  FYI.....MOST Americans do NOT own stocks.  #VoteThemOut #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #MAGA
1188 2018-09-20 16:21:07 @SaraEisen @carlquintanilla @jonfortt I would like to see a montage tape of all the talking heads the so called experts who predicted the Trump tariffs were going to be bad for stocks and the economy .. they deserve a little publicity for being dead wrong don't cha think ?
1189 2018-09-20 16:20:40 Makes it all the more easier to be patient with Dividend growth stocks. DGI has certainly helped me hold onto my winners in ACN, V, MA, UNH, ROST, TJX, NKE over the past few years.

1193 2018-09-20 16:20:00 #Stocks are getting a boost after news broke that #China may be reducing its average tariffs on trading partners. They want to lower costs for Chinese consumers. There is pressure for China to come back and settle a deal with the US.
1194 2018-09-20 16:19:50 Breaking news. Regular trading hours changed from 4pm to 4:20 to allow markets more room to run and accomadate all the people smoking marijuana while purchasing stocks. #ridiculous

1208 2018-09-20 16:16:17 exactly, that's why an extension doesn't mean anything, and if you go through extensions announcements and effects on stock the results are minimal at best, however most of the time the stocks below $1 by then, which I thought was interesting.

1237 2018-09-20 16:11:41 But I was still recommending/advocating a very "long" market stance because I felt other forces (Trump policies, tax cuts, etc.) would outweigh those concerns and continue to send stocks higher. It's only since Jan/Feb that I've been flying the caution flag

1241 2018-09-20 16:10:26 I tested out a couple trading chatroom early this year. They never said 'go buy' or 'go all in'. All they say is "try it out. I think it should happen". All vague as fuk $mu $amd $tlry #stocks
1242 2018-09-20 16:10:25 Don’t feel bad about missing top ticking $TLRY at $300, most likely this will create some great over head and trapped longs for when all this noise fades away and these stocks get pumped
1243 2018-09-20 16:10:16 Agreed, but the rationale of ban bump stocks ban high capacity mags is nonsense. Anyone with ANY gun knowledge can replicate the outcome of having both. If one can drop and load a mag, the only issue it causes is carrying more or being more accurate. These are knee jerk reactions
1244 2018-09-20 16:10:11 Buti naka order anak ko !!!!pag balik nya to place another order nagulat kami Out of stocks agad !!! @mainedcm ibang klaseng ka

1250 2018-09-20 16:09:28 you know when in stocks we hit RSI above 80 then we go in float mode there it just keeps on hitting it again and again ..in upper range of 65-75 .. i call it the cream ..
1251 2018-09-20 16:09:11 Agreed. Serious question. Need to do some big changes. I know NVDA is great but thinking of selling 45 of 70 & SHOP 25 of 125 & several small things & buying 10 AMZN. Will b 60 next mo trying to get big caps & decrease the amt of stocks in $108K profile? Wisdom please
1252 2018-09-20 16:09:04 @LazadaPH how many stocks of Maine Mac Lipstick do u have???

1258 2018-09-20 16:07:49 Helps you right? How many folks have a 401k or are able to buy stocks? My guess is not many. Many companies do not offer pensions, sick time, nor vacation time. Especially those that work part time. you tell me who benefits?  The wealth - i wouldn't brag to much.

1262 2018-09-20 16:05:53 I often talk about the FANG stocks  and I have talked about a lot of companies all morning. Can’t hit all of them all the time, but I try to mention the ones hitting new highs
1263 2018-09-20 16:05:52 Bump stocks? People worry about these and I laugh. The very same outcome can be achieved with a rubber band. Are going to ban those too? I’m not blind to the fact people are using guns for bad things but the issue here is people not guns. we need to hold PEOPLE more accountable
1264 2018-09-20 16:05:18 The non-profit distinction ends up not mattering much. Dividends are rent on capital. In a non-profit structure you pay the same rent, you just call them bonds and loans instead of stocks. Very unlike schools, where the govt provides the capital so they don't have to pay rent
1265 2018-09-20 16:05:08 I’m not bearish at all right now #natgas.. we will fell some more pain with a high 50s low 60s injection next week with this very low stocks.. waiting for red maps to show up mid October to short it..if any..
1266 2018-09-20 16:05:07 Yes, the volatility is high and the stocks are increasingly disconnected from any sustainable valuations.
1267 2018-09-20 16:05:01 Stocks for Cronos Group Inc. have been getting bought up at a noticeable rate at near 30% gains, insiders anticipating a big deal with a pharmaceutical firm soon that could result in a huge stock price surge.

1270 2018-09-20 16:04:45 No. My reasoning is that cash is the worst investment to sit on - I always want my money invested. Therefore, my decision is not 'should I invest?' but 'where should I invest?'. Stocks, Bonds and Housing looks to me like a bubble so I'm not keen on any of them (cont')
1271 2018-09-20 16:04:43 I still don't own it :( I haven't gotten to buying tech stocks yet but it's on the horizon.

Having this one private as well as in Millionærklubben
1277 2018-09-20 16:02:51 It's also law abiding citizens who buy high capacity round magazines and bump stocks then turn into criminals when they shoot up crowds of people to murder as many as they can. perhaps there needs to be a ban on certain accessories. Gun Control doesn't mean no guns.

1283 2018-09-20 16:01:11 Yes, I saw the meme.  The NRA is two entities.  The actual organization and then the members.  Standing up for gun rights is fine.  Using millions of dollars to coerce law makers to not ban bump stocks or AR-styled weapons is not.  Just two examples.

I guess the mobile app doesn't work for volitle stocks.

With that said I agree on some cannabis crypto that just doesn't have a valid use case rather than being marketed to the cannabis crowd.

1330 2018-09-20 15:46:57 Similarly, the stock market stalled for much of 2016 on Trump fears. When he was elected the market regained stronger growth. The stocks that would be negatively impacted by Trump had already been depressed. Those that could benefit, though, had not yet fully grown

1393 2018-09-20 15:23:23 Pot stocks are not as widely owned as internet stocks. Individual stock ownership was at record highs in 1999/2000. Not today. We've had pops in crypto, country funds, theme restaurants, etc., that were only "tiny bubbles" that burst on their own without killing whole market
1394 2018-09-20 15:23:11 So here’s the plan: dump my cash into #CryptoCurrency, wait for Trump’s trade wars to plunge us into the next great recession which will undoubtedly pump crypto, sell crypto at the top to buy stocks at the bottom, wait for the economy to recover and retire.

1403 2018-09-20 15:20:43 Legally congress and the president could only make it harder to get guns, they can't remove the 2A. This is a fact, not some fairy tale. And I could agree Trump isn't trying to do much, but he got bump stocks banned, and thats at least something.

1415 2018-09-20 15:19:04 Opened that high? Wtf! Who decided that? It’s coming back down like Australis did. I’m waiting until $7 or less. Damn Tilray bs is causing all other pot stocks to tank.

1419 2018-09-20 15:18:08 Of course the sec is going ot be all over pot stocks now, just like they were with Elon's tweet as that is where institutions have their money, and once again Ted gets away with theft of retail.
1420 2018-09-20 15:18:00 Yes Tom there are. I feel confident that I have timed my return from a break quite well as I see lots of value out there and cheap stocks just waiting to be bought and multi-bagged and #BHRD is just one of those such stocks along with many others

1426 2018-09-20 15:16:13 Retail stocks $KSS and $JWN are getting hammered today. Day traders can watch $KSS around the $74.85 area for intra-day support. That level looks solid right now should it get down there. I'm still working on a $JWN level.

1441 2018-09-20 15:11:12 How Robinhood Emphasizes Design to Make Stock Trading More Accessible 

The idea of trading stocks, for many people, triggers a porcupine-like reaction. It’s too complicated, too expensive, and the platforms that allow you do it feel straight out of the early 2000s.

That’s …

1447 2018-09-20 15:10:36 The stock market is not a measure of the wealth of all the people.  Only a very small fraction of the people own any stocks and most are owned by the already very rich.  So basically, you are hailing the increase is the disparity in wealth between the 99% and the 1%.

1458 2018-09-20 15:07:53 The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. Corporations are buying back stocks vs putting their tax scam windfall into employees. Deficit has exploded. Massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid & social safety nets are being proposed. A recession is in our future.

1464 2018-09-20 15:06:59 watch the high beta stocks trying to break out above this consolidation since January. To me, a monster breakout in $SPHB is still the higher probability outcome with target of 57. No reason to be overly bullish unless we're above 46 imo
1465 2018-09-20 15:06:25 Sell your shitty $RIOT stock and forget bitcoin rallying this year. Buy $MMNFF as pot stocks are going to run up a lot with hype and demand.

1468 2018-09-20 15:04:56 @carlquintanilla Blodget is a fool. Tons of stocks are undervalued. Only a few techs are way overpriced.
1469 2018-09-20 15:04:40 Bro we would sell so many more stocks and a whole new demographic would be attracted. All of the ppl that wear jeans at the gym would love us
1470 2018-09-20 15:04:38 @IGClientHelp I follow mostly SETSqx stocks (AIM) on one watchlist, and find it odd that I can view the charts by "LT" (Last Traded) up to 3 hour candles, but anything larger only lets me view by the closing spread (eg Mid/Ask/Bid). This wasn't always the case - can you fix it?
1471 2018-09-20 15:04:32 One of my stocks (I picked my damn self) is up 74% since I bought it. Go me.

1479 2018-09-20 15:03:44 So what. Most citizens don't own stocks. It is no indicator of the state of the nation. The .01% keep winning while you burden the rest of us with debt. Zero days being presidential.
1480 2018-09-20 15:03:36 I was thinking more along the lines of putting the miscreants in Stocks in the market Square, pelting them with the fruits of their irresponsibility...
1481 2018-09-20 15:03:21 Does everyone remember that short two month time period when everyone thought ICO’s were the next big thing? Maybe the same with cannabis stocks now perhaps. Thoughts?
1482 2018-09-20 15:03:20 @Moet_UK Where have these little bottles been all my life!!! I cant find a sigle bar that stocks them :(
1483 2018-09-20 15:02:56 One reason that I find compelling, but I haven't seen used, to justify higher valuations - stocks are now about 25% less volatile than much older history (pre-WWII). Using the same expected Sharpe Ratio, one can justify a higher valuation due to the lower volatility.
1484 2018-09-20 15:02:53 But it's also bullish for stocks when rates go down...weird!

1509 2018-09-20 14:54:50 Hi David. We're unable to check a specific store's stock, unfortunately. Our promotional offers are subject to availability while stocks last, and stocks can vary between stores. Our store staff will be best placed to let you know which products they have available.
1510 2018-09-20 14:54:06 You can't own a land, a house, a bank account, a company or even stocks without a third party (bank, government...). You could own physical gold but you will still have to store it somewhere. If you own Bitcoin with private keys, you don't rely on any 3rd party. Safest asset.

1512 2018-09-20 14:53:40 Just looked over at the kid sitting next me in class who was trading stocks instead of taking notes and he saw me looking and instantly slammed his laptop closed so I think I might’ve just stumbled upon some insider trading taking place
1513 2018-09-20 14:53:27 I want to get into penny stocks so badly but I don't know where to start. Everything looks so complicated.
1514 2018-09-20 14:53:18 Guess @geeheezy can't trade NQ or ES with the big boys.  stick to stocks.  more your speed.
1515 2018-09-20 14:52:59 Obviously QE has somewhat diluted the relationship between the market and the economy but QE is over, we are finally shrinking our balance sheet, and raising interest rates. These things suck liquidity out of the economy, yet stocks continue to go up. And all you say is NOPE!
1516 2018-09-20 14:52:49 so are you shorting cannabis stocks on October 17? That would kind of be like the same day bitcoin started trading on futures exchanges.

1519 2018-09-20 14:51:30 Because bump stocks weren't considered firearms, there are no records kept of who purchased them. Gun stores can’t comb through 4473s and look for who bought them so they can hand this information over to law enforcement. There’s no way for to know just who bought what and when.

1546 2018-09-20 14:45:12 The volume is significant.  If stocks like #CCO ever get moving it will decrease the weighting %s of smaller equities.  This in turn will reduce the selling pressure and possibly trigger buying.

1552 2018-09-20 14:43:27 For those confused, companies are adapting to operate in spite of presidential policies. The world market has vastly changed since World War 2 and international mergers and buy outs have allowed for economies to grow and for stocks to reach all time highs. #nobullyeconomics

1554 2018-09-20 14:43:20 The Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to its all-time high on Thursday, while the S&P 500 hit a fresh record. Stocks are gaining momentum as manufacturing rebounds and the job market strengthens, fueling the U.S. economic rebound.

1555 2018-09-20 14:42:51 To the bottom 50% of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck , those who would struggle to come up with $500 cash, those drowning in credit card debit or student loans, those not in stocks....well hell ..fuck them.
1556 2018-09-20 14:42:45 What's going on with Bank of America? Top 5 US banks all share the same Board of Directors so going from 1 to the other won't help. Protect yourself!

1650 2018-09-20 14:13:13 And NBC- just like CBS’s MoonLess who bragged “Trump is bad 4 America but GREAt 4 CBS’s stocks!” Yet no one mentions how they (yes including H.Stern) enabled this ‘previously’ known racist monster/ultimately propelled to t-most powerful position!

1654 2018-09-20 14:11:35 Has to do with banking stocks on the index. Book value is higher, but earning is still depressed. 
As RJ said in his last tv appearance, turnaround for banking is around the corner.
1655 2018-09-20 14:11:18 When I started my sip, it went up for 8 months. Then it went down for 3 months. (A bunch of stocks in fund was going down)

1656 2018-09-20 14:11:08 The US Stocks are designed to always be going up at about the rate of inflation.   "Cash Growth".
Companies that are not doing well are regularly removed from the lists and replaced by newer higher performing companies.

1774 2018-09-20 13:45:09 Some of the best investment opportunities are companies that don't screen very well. Their stocks remain untouched and unloved while the qualitative factors boil below the surface of the financials. Dig below the surface. Find them before others. This is the art of investing.

1839 2018-09-20 13:29:12 Challenge away! Agreed - stocks are appealing for investors beyond their earnings yield, especially post tax cuts. Some argue this is a flawed metric. That said, the rise in yields challenges the idea of yield-less savers scouring the earth for something that provides income.
1840 2018-09-20 13:28:53 Paul, I believe so many of these stocks are trapped at ridiculous lows/valuations cos of the Beaufort situation and the loose shares that are out there, or shorts that are being held, which they need to buy back next week

1847 2018-09-20 13:26:26 I hope so - I guess gotta weigh up piling Risk on Risk. Ignoring Mine operating problems you got huge Commodity Price exposure and then Political Risk on top etc. Just gotta be careful and not put all your money in such Stocks.

1870 2018-09-20 13:17:26 Gas prices up 50cents over last year. Food prices up. My economy isn’t better. Maybe your stocks are up.
1871 2018-09-20 13:16:41 This is a solid strategy. The problem is that a lot of these stocks aren't undiscovered and most always trade at a premium multiple because they are high-quality businesses. You have to ignore the multiple or wait for the overall market to dive before buying.
1872 2018-09-20 13:16:39 Let me know when they have:

1929 2018-09-20 12:57:17 Guys is there a shop that stocks board games and such in Ghana??? Scrabble, Jenga, Four in a row...
1930 2018-09-20 12:56:44 He’s literally said this every year since I first started looking at $tsla in 2014. What people don’t understand is that it’s the easiest it’s ever been to invest in stocks thru apps. Millennial have never seen a recession as an adult, so “hodl” is a real thing. Go Tesla!
1931 2018-09-20 12:56:36 @andrewrsorkin for your panel. The difference between tobacco stocks and pot stocks is that tobacco stocks/companies deceived the public and  knowingly chemically enhanced a naturally grown plant to create a product that was harmful to the body. Pot's being applied for cures.

1933 2018-09-20 12:55:58 As U.S. government debt yields fell to record lows in the wake of the crisis, investors who wanted more than a 0-1% return were forced to take more risk. Many saw junk bonds and stocks, etc., as the ONLY alternatives if they wanted any real yield at all. (thread)
1934 2018-09-20 12:55:12 Price to sales ratio for weeds stocks. $tlry 970. $cron 512. $cgc 142
1935 2018-09-20 12:55:03 I wouldn't be surprised if Japan has been selling bonds and buying stocks; just saying.
1936 2018-09-20 12:54:56 That was a classic moment on #CNBC w/ Ken Langone rendering a guy speechless. Sputtering to answer his question about has he thought that the cannabis stocks (1 of which he was pumping madly) had the same problem as tobacco stocks. Classic $SPX $NDX $IWM
1937 2018-09-20 12:54:25 The bill says you can't REGULATE & lobby.

Or own stocks & "regulate"

So no that is why Republicans aren't passing it.

1938 2018-09-20 12:54:17 Ken can roll out a turd bomb better than anyone because he is wealthy and doesn't care!  Love you Ken!! Greed is the reason for pot stocks. Very simple and great question.
1939 2018-09-20 12:54:14 Well, @WallandBroad I’ve been holding for >3 years & will continue to hold. $XXII is into nicotine reduction & industrial hemp/medicinal marijuana. Why do you say it is a pump and dump?  Based on what exactly? IMHO some MJ stocks are overpriced but XXII is actually undervalued.
1940 2018-09-20 12:53:57 Not all trades have to be with big positions - Solid $50-100 wins will add up.  I'm a fan of having two brokers #robinhood and #etrade.  When I go smaller; I utilize Robinhood so there are no commissions.   Takeaways - it's ok and I highly suggest 2+ brokers. #stocks $NIO $nbev

1942 2018-09-20 12:52:52 I’m thinking about getting in on some of these weed stocks but I think the way to play it is to buy Cronos, they invest in different companies so you get the diversification without single stock risk
1943 2018-09-20 12:52:34 These pot stocks are soaring after speculations around marijuana-infused drinks. Tilray went up to $300 at some point yesterday.
1944 2018-09-20 12:52:17 "Antes de arrancar un programa anti inflacionario tenés que sacarte de encima los stocks indeseables” Jc De Pablo.
1945 2018-09-20 12:52:07 That’s crazy. Question. Is Halting trading on stocks to prevent speculation from driving the price out of control or are there different reasons to halt trading?
1946 2018-09-20 12:51:50 Cash moving from bonds to stocks?
1947 2018-09-20 12:51:26 - @nike is the perfect example of you’re rewarded when you do the right thing. They boycotted you, & your sales and stocks are at its highest. 
1948 2018-09-20 12:51:21 Pot stocks such as $TLRY will perform in a largely volatile manner, and investors begin to learn about the benefits of investing in #Marijuanastocks. 

Movement of #Tilray yesterday shows the level of volatility that these stocks will show on the slightest news.
1949 2018-09-20 12:50:25 Nike stocks are going up.   Boys keep taking the knee
1950 2018-09-20 12:50:14 se dollaro fa un nuovo giro a 88, anche con tassi sopra 3,25, necessari visto debito US e svalutazione $, la volatilità non dovrebbe essere colpita perché in questo caso gli algos vanno a comprare direttamente stocks per coprirsi dalla perdita di valore nominale della moneta..
1951 2018-09-20 12:49:55 If you are interested investing in weed stocks, there are plenty of other companies to do so with. I would stay far away from $TLRY
1952 2018-09-20 12:49:50 My cat picks stocks for me. As a result my portfolio is heavily weighted toward pet food manufacturers. Is there something wrong here?
1953 2018-09-20 12:49:29 To me it's all the same. US stocks are attractive because of growth and RoW because of value. The tech crash in 2000 was the beginning of a shift towards ex-US stocks and value stocks.
1954 2018-09-20 12:49:14 First off where are my stocks if you put me on bae? Secondly don’t be trying to play me in these streets
1955 2018-09-20 12:49:00 It is math.  Exponential functions.  The cost of carry verwhelns the asset values.  Then we crash as human nature does not act linearly in a panic.  Watch the weed stocks, as the next example.
1956 2018-09-20 12:48:57 Is @CNBC Calling everyone with any relationship to weed stocks to come on the air and complain about why their Company isn't getting the same insane valuation as $TLRY ?
1957 2018-09-20 12:48:33 They will not leave because they have nowhere to go. Stocks can always be replenished. Those familiar with the trade know that only a few items are on display whilst the rest is under safekeeping. Vending can't just be wished away in this economy
1958 2018-09-20 12:48:16 Great call on china stocks
1959 2018-09-20 12:48:05 Morning Market Update: stocks trade higher as trade fears ease
1960 2018-09-20 12:47:54 Missed most of yesterday outside of the weed stocks, but I assume the teevee guys love the banks again?
1961 2018-09-20 12:47:11 imo it's less interesting than smash's equivalent in crew battles because there's not much you can immediately quantify someone who did really well

like it's "holy shit this dude took off ten stocks" vs. "he won a round and then did about 50% the next??? around that number?????"
1962 2018-09-20 12:47:09 Vermont's new gun law goes into effect on October 1, and VPR is running police-sponsored PSAs about dropping off your bump stocks but not bringing your gun along when you do so. Welcome to concealed carry-land, that's not gonna change.
1963 2018-09-20 12:47:02 #potstocks are the new internet stocks of the 90’s.
1964 2018-09-20 12:45:45 If you are having fun, adulting can be ok.  Be sure you “pay yourself” first: 401k; savings plan; dividend reinvestment stocks.
1965 2018-09-20 12:45:32 and failure (related) to understand the difference between problem of flows and problem of stocks (depletion) and absorption capacity.  Focus on C02 and GDP feeds into this.  Basically, we're wilfully stupidifying ourselves, and it will end very very badly. Quite soon, imo.
1966 2018-09-20 12:45:16 I would not be surprised in the least if two stocks fell 50% in one day: 

$TLRY and $TIS.
1967 2018-09-20 12:45:10 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 7 stocks Wednesday including $AXTA, $ESV and  $GS.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 71% in $FEYE where September 16.5 calls bought for $0.36 closed at $0.61.
1968 2018-09-20 12:45:09 Niggas really be out here on 18x7.5 2-piece Works talking bout #realwheelgang. Like ok so were your weak ass stocks, sit your ass back down.

1970 2018-09-20 12:44:32 notato oggi che lavoro di "fino" gli algos!??!
colpiscono il dollaro, che spinge s gli stocks che vanno in recupero verso i miei 3.180, contemporaneamente gestiscono la curva tassi sulla linea maginot di 3.25, vol. compressa e liquidità fortissima,ambiente perfetto per i bull
1971 2018-09-20 12:44:11 I'm curious got hit from Amazon News yesterday but $KR didn't get low much. How about today????? anyone seen Amazon power?? I have $Amzn shares I'm just worrying stocks down cause no experience stores.
1972 2018-09-20 12:43:46 More drive by hits please! About TLRY, people acting like there’s no other names to own. There’s dozens of established stocks, especially in Canada (no crypto wallet needed). The only scarcity is TLRY float.
1973 2018-09-20 12:43:40 Here we go again CNBC talking about pot stocks again-- Great market Bernanke and Yellen developed.  BTW Peter Thiel should be ashamed of himself for being involved in pump and dump like TLRY
1974 2018-09-20 12:43:06 I am not shorting any cannabis stocks. I do not short meme stocks $TLRY
1975 2018-09-20 12:40:51 I wish Bob Marley was around to see how many millionaires have been made investing in weed stocks.
1976 2018-09-20 12:40:15 Good Morning $NBEV the gift that keeps on giving $$$ as well as other pot stocks ... while extremely over extended should give plenty of scalps again today. $GALT $ADVM on watch back burner reverse split plays after $ALT yesterday $MBOT & $JONE

1980 2018-09-20 12:39:31 Inflation has been brewing for a while and looks like its kicking in. Bottoming patterns in gas wheat metals. Oil still bullish. Will stocks rally together with gold? No more ratehikes 2018? Or will dollar join the party?

1983 2018-09-20 12:38:17 VUL - Done

1985 2018-09-20 12:37:10 India Globalization Capital, Inc. $IGC - As cannabis-related stocks continue to see strong upward volatility, shares of this cannabis-based therapy developer are trading up 6.6 percent in the pre-market session. Watch for continued sector-wide movement throughout the session.

1987 2018-09-20 12:36:51 MUFG with Akamai created a block chain faster than xrp. You can buy stocks in both companies.
1988 2018-09-20 12:36:46 Knew I should've bought cannabis stocks.
1989 2018-09-20 12:36:12 Stocks are not crypto. The management of these companies are given stocks out of thin air. Charlie had to mine or buy all the litecoin he had.
1990 2018-09-20 12:36:11 You mean like the blockchain stocks last year ?
1991 2018-09-20 12:35:52 Darn, they're out of stocks.  l:

1992 2018-09-20 12:35:36 Viagra stocks tumble, hospitals inundated with Bond fans and male cinephiles in a permanent state of arousal - “I’ve tried Doc, it just won’t go down.  Think of the potential opening sequence tracking shot Doc"
1993 2018-09-20 12:34:57 @jimcramer watched the tips you gave yesterday. Thx!!
But Seeing stocks go up after I sell them still makes me CRAZY!!!
1994 2018-09-20 12:33:36 Looking at the US equity market is always a great reminder that I love trading currencies. My views re stocks hurt me in 2017 and I committed to staying away this year. Currencies make a whole lot more sense to me. I like that there is always some kind of demand for any currency.
1995 2018-09-20 12:33:36 And $TLRY margin req got jacked, however $TLRY is still a rigged play it's always been on my no-fucking-way fly list, these rigged stocks with story and future catalysts can find a range and trade sideways for a long time
1996 2018-09-20 12:33:15 Stocks going down. Huhuhu
1997 2018-09-20 12:33:07 someone brought up weed stocks in my 8 am class & we all had a whole discussion about how it works, & the prof was like "you guys are all experts in this field, i wonder how" & i looked at the dude sitting next to me and he was fuucking stoned, BRO L FOR L LEGGGGGGO
1998 2018-09-20 12:32:50 “my daughter loves @Starbucks so much, that i invested in their stocks” dad goals or ??????
1999 2018-09-20 12:32:46 I've been in the camp consistently that we've needed to be buying stocks and people have been getting mad at me for it. Almost like if I was doing something wrong for buying stocks in uptrends. It's crazy
2000 2018-09-20 12:31:05 Hey Hannah, I am so sorry but our delivery drivers don't cover U.S.A. But I would suggest a good search on a popular web search engine that rhymes with noodle and i'm sure you will find a store that stocks them there. Thanks, Gordon.
2001 2018-09-20 12:30:19 some movement stocks/ gappers im watching on the side today are $ROCK $LXFR $NEO  .. hope everyone has a great day.. have a few things to tackle with the business then trainig more jiu jitsu and yoga tonight! lets do our best and be honorable!
2002 2018-09-20 12:30:01 I think that the 'Beggar Row' was called St Ninian's Row. That whole area - St Ninian's Row, Scottis Clois, St Mary's Wynd, Leith Wynd and the 'Flesh Stocks'(houses listed as 'behind the...' or 'at the...') accounted for large proportion of evictions. Life must have been grim 
2003 2018-09-20 12:29:50 @jimcramer Why is Tilray making the most ridiculous move up compared to other marijuana stocks? Thanks!
2004 2018-09-20 12:29:31 cube prioritising money over their artists, being disloyal af. breaks at the slightest criticism over hyuna and e'dawn dating, god forbid. breaks again when they saw their stocks drop like hoe what'd you expect?? get yourself a new team cube cuz yall fucking up  #CubeIsOverParty
2005 2018-09-20 12:29:18 PBAY you have had all loser stocks this year. Your trend will continue. I can name 40 serious ppl on here that all think your a big joke. #pbayguarantee 
2006 2018-09-20 12:28:29 @salomondrin yo i need some help on stocks.. what do u think of tilray do you think it has more potential to grow or it’s a dud because it went from 117 to 300 in one day then went back down to 220! Help!!!
2007 2018-09-20 12:28:14 just had a thought that probably the worst thing longer term for the cannabis stocks is this huge move in $TLRY. This probably leads to many startups trying to get into the industry and there are no barriers to entry just need some land a bit of farming experience.
2008 2018-09-20 12:27:50 People came here because we pillage their resources. West African migrants come because we've sent factory trawlers all the way to Angola. These ships leave NOTHING behind. No future stocks, destroying livelihoods on the way. WE are responsible.
2009 2018-09-20 12:27:03 Somewhere between 3.5%-4% on the 10-year, my guess is lots of people will be waking up to reality of pricier capital and more serious competition for stocks (not to mention interest expense for gov’t)
2010 2018-09-20 12:26:59 @LifesDecOfCards have you invested or looked into in any weed stocks?
2011 2018-09-20 12:24:08 No wonder VIX is down. Bonds are selling off (yields up) while USD is going down too. Wait for it, upon correction from this situation, stocks are going to go down HARD.

2016 2018-09-20 12:21:38 @option_snipper Please add me to your private twitter feed. Coincidently, I was day trading options on the same stocks as you when I first followed you on your public feed. Your comments on these stock and their options have helped me immensely. Thank you.
2017 2018-09-20 12:21:16 Discovering that stocks have a market-determined borrow fee is only next to discovering that options have expiry dates and time value in terms of the amount of generated excitement. (When discovered the hard way)
2018 2018-09-20 12:21:08 This is a bubble in Tilray. It's not a bubble in pot stocks (yet). Big, big difference.

2020 2018-09-20 12:20:07 So before, rising $DXY+rising $TLT was bullish $SPY because U.S. was attracting bond+stock inflows while foreign stocks were tanking. Now, a falling $$+falling bonds are bullish stocks because it's good for multinationals & cuz $$ rotating out of bonds, into stocks. Got it. LOL

2089 2018-09-20 11:43:46 Dave I agree it is very interesting to hear how the more experienced traders handle bad news on one of their stocks. Do you jump out straight away and take the hit or wait and see if it levels out. Shit happens to all of us. It’s all about learning how to be a better trader.
2090 2018-09-20 11:43:27 I would say this is about 5-10% of the fervor, at best. Almost no one cares. In ’99 the nation was rooting for stocks like they were college football teams.

2093 2018-09-20 11:42:57 How is democracy being limited by the EU?

Which rules don't you like?

At 24 months after Nintendo has this holiday coming, the switch will likely outpace it. That’s huge for them.

2109 2018-09-20 11:32:20 It'll be worth zero when the financial system collapses. Buy gold or silver, much more reliable than trusting fraudster banks with your cash. There's a reason why countries are stocking up their gold stocks and banks quietly investing into mining gold and silver.

2115 2018-09-20 11:25:55 I gave my opinion, its not told you so or from a genius but small cap biotech stocks are v risky, often binary outcomes from trials. The best way to mitigate risk is get in early and de-risk early.
2116 2018-09-20 11:25:44 To what extent can the current breath divergence be attributed to global weakness vs. US? Lots of international stocks listed on NYSE. GM suggests the HO gives clearer signals when using Nasdaq - may be a contributing factor..

2118 2018-09-20 11:25:06 Not in the US no - using the BAML survey as a proxy you could argue it’s the very strength in the US economy which is driving both this lift in rates and a massive allocation AND overweight to US stocks from discretionary money managers

I'm more comfortable with the former
2131 2018-09-20 11:17:39 If you take what those two (Mike & Rob) are saying and take the games Cramer says is done on manipulation of stocks then the average investor is really in a tough spot on having confidence.

2137 2018-09-20 11:12:34 You’re welcome. We’ll see. At a juncture here, where bond prices appear poised to lose that support; but we can keep an eye out if conditions shift and set up another rally instead. Likelihood appears smaller but if stocks weaken off, if the dollar declines, things might shift.

Increase speed of light boom a little, make upside down kick harder to bait throws or it gets thrown. Guile v skill stocks up, twice gives 2 hits, once gives one hit. I’d add Menat 3 bar
2170 2018-09-20 10:52:23 Then I would not use economic growth as the metric at all. Returns are on a bond or an index or a set of stocks. I understand the underlying point being made, and it may even be a good one. But I think it's not well served by an incorrect metric.
2171 2018-09-20 10:52:19 @jimcramer Jim, every day #MadMoney watcher, pod cast listener. Can you talk on your show about selling shares #profit? Sell first stocks purchased, or last stocks purchased? Thanks
2172 2018-09-20 10:51:27 Jobs, stocks, ended war taxes, vets, security etc.... They want what exactly?
2173 2018-09-20 10:51:24 Sample portfolio 1Y performance: Random tech stocks +17%, A Passive global fund +9%, Bank's own actively managed growth fund +5%. Guess in which order the bank advices these options.
2174 2018-09-20 10:51:15 True, but now bonds selling off with a bit more earnest. Will get to stocks at some point. May not have perfect symmetry with stocks, but will impact over intermediate-term.

2202 2018-09-20 10:26:19 On Friday, It  will be interesting to trade in Yes Bank.

Best way to trade is wait till 10.00 am and the all euphoria will evaporate . Mark high and low of the time and see the stock is moving up or moving down .

Trade in the same direction and we may make profitable trade.

2226 2018-09-20 10:08:46 So it may be a case that buying Legal Weed stocks is analogous to buying Standard Oil in 1870 prior to the building of their 1st pipeline in 1873, (which crashed the railroads and US economy), in that the Legal Weed Market is still underdeveloped - but major players will emerge.

2233 2018-09-20 10:04:20 So far, my investments are all in stocks (so I’m basically screwed if it crashes... keeping my fingers crossed that it doesn’t). Hoping to be able to get into real estate soon though! It’s always much better to be diversified, after all.
2234 2018-09-20 10:04:07 Conservative Party Conference starts Sunday 30th September (end of next week) and goes on to Wednesday. I can't see this going well and could cause lot of volatility on Pound and Stocks.

2236 2018-09-20 10:00:52 Marc, good luck to you in the next two decades. I wish you provided solid arguments for your case of stock growth instead of just percentage changes of gold and global stocks...which is just way to simple. I provided arguments from different parameters. You are not convinced.
2237 2018-09-20 10:00:28 Yesterday when I was looking there were several times that the chart would blank or and I would get a message of data not available. No other stocks though.

2243 2018-09-20 09:59:04 On a separate rant, went out for dinner last night at a chain restaurant that stocks BrewDog.
Or rather used to stock them. This was a major thing, instead of crappy, badly kept ale or over priced Guinness I could get a bottle of decent IPA. /1
2244 2018-09-20 09:59:00 I'm sure the Ad division is an entirely different topic than the FC workers.  Just saying.  BUT, since you brought it up, I have no need of public assistance.  I make a living wage and full benefits. (monthly bonuses and stocks too)   Me and mine are living just fine.

2253 2018-09-20 09:52:34 Weed stocks in general should continue their speculation rise at least until October when weed becomes legal in Canada. 

Market Replacement Theory suggests that Legal Weed is about a $150 billion per year market as that is 10% of the $1.5 trillion Alcohol Market.
2254 2018-09-20 09:51:57 What scares me more though is that Trump is now taking full ownership of the stock bubble that he denounced so strongly in 2016. Stocks aren't the real economy, the buyback mania going on right now (withholding investment) will only benefit those at the top, 0 benefit to most

2273 2018-09-20 09:35:05 Confusion: How to decide which stocks to trade when there are more than 10 Squeeze breakout stocks. (4/4)
2274 2018-09-20 09:34:07 Still you haven't learned me anything, other than Ray Dalio disagrees. Why does he disagree? No counterargument you made why stocks are unlikely to have another 1 to 2 decades of bull market. Wasting my time with you.
2275 2018-09-20 09:34:02 Mistake: Traded all the stocks for the day with Squeeze breakouts. Did this for 7 trading days. There were days when I had place 30+ breaket orders and out of them 20+ had got triggered. (2/n)
2276 2018-09-20 09:34:02 I figured it out: Monsanto had a setback and now weed stocks soar!  #TLRY

2294 2018-09-20 09:15:55 Much appreciated. Hopefully the stocks will fill up soon again!
2295 2018-09-20 09:13:27 I think it depends on if it is trading or investing. Those stocks are not for investing but maybe OK for trading. Any technical weakness would be a sell.

2548 2018-09-20 04:42:17 No.. thats not the reason.. public is smart to not fall for bullshit from agenda driven media (though there may be an interim scare) 
Bank deposits could be low due to ppl shifting towards mutual funds (look at surge in SIP inflows), stocks n spending too..
2549 2018-09-20 04:41:58 The Stocks app is visually too distracting for me. I don’t like that I can’t completely hide the news pane. Apple seems to really want me to see news AND market info.
2550 2018-09-20 04:40:22 Asian stocks followed global indexes higher on Thursday, as investors took a less bearish view on the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on markets, a sharp contrast to dim expectations economists had on U.S. growth amid the worsening tensions.
2551 2018-09-20 04:39:57 Investors are flocking to cannabis stocks. 

They're buying low and selling really high.

2553 2018-09-20 04:39:08 When you play Super Smash Bros, how many stocks do you play with? I feel like 3 stocks is for very skilled people, like I fuck around too much with my first life. 5 stocks is kinda just too many lives. And while 4 stocks is a decent intermediary, it doesn't feel right.

2555 2018-09-20 04:37:17 Honestly, if you guys wanna get a better chance at getting your B.A. , health insurance, vacation hours, 401k/stocks , even discounts at many places, work for Starbucks! They legit love their partners so so much! So so many benefits we get.

2564 2018-09-20 04:29:44 I’m up looking at stocks 
2565 2018-09-20 04:28:59 This market has me shook tbh. Difficult to make comfortable decisions. All/most logical (personal) parameters say yes. You're getting a quasi FMCG play at 21x TTM.
Management being a quack I can't comment. Price action worrying but most stocks are falling

2566 2018-09-20 04:28:03 Soon enough I wanna start buying stocks, any advice?
2567 2018-09-20 04:27:05 Also avoid stocks that r dependent on govt policies
2568 2018-09-20 04:26:25 Past experience a la the failure of Danica Patrick, Lyn St. James, Shawna Robinson, Patty Moise, even Sara Fisher in Indycars.   Also at local level I've seen Stacy Botticello and more recently Melissa Fifield.   Botticello won in DARE stocks at Stafford Speedway but that was it
2569 2018-09-20 04:25:20 Then Fox is doing a really good job. GDP up. Stocks up. Unemployment down. Those jobs Obama said weren't coming back are coming back! So suck on it. MAGA.

2574 2018-09-20 04:19:46 @MariaC82 no moral qualms about promoting pot stocks? (In the sense they are overvalued)
2575 2018-09-20 04:18:58 mi presentación de hoy fue sobre el cannabis market, stocks, investments y todo  sobre eso , A MI PROFE LE ENCANTÓ
2576 2018-09-20 04:16:51 Opportunistic investors are buying the dip. Don't give a crap about Colin or his "politics". Stocks 52 week low triggered automated buys. KAPERNICK can suck donkey weenie for all the investors care, knowing Nike still employs child labor at a fraction of the cost!

2582 2018-09-20 04:12:19 Stocks plunged as Health Net, Inc. unveiled a moronic bidet today.
2583 2018-09-20 04:11:08 good one buddy. TA and finding good stocks to trade on chart is not that easy, as people think. I am trying from past many years, yet not succesful
2584 2018-09-20 04:09:40 Cramer you have to educate yourself about Cannabis stocks, I know you went to the green conference, and that’s cute, but people are clowning on you man. 1/2 trillion $ industry, learn Indica vs Sativa applications. Both medical my dude!
2585 2018-09-20 04:09:32 Do you all think this is the only guy that had done no good to WOMEN? Every Company, Big and small business around the world, has their own bad guys who did this! What if all those women starts suing their ex-bosses & co-workers? Big Problem for the Stocks Markets!

2587 2018-09-20 04:08:15 If you guys want to purchase an iPhone and save some portion of your money, purchase the iPhone X while stocks last. In my opinion, X and XS not much difference, and that’s why they stopped selling iPhone X.
2588 2018-09-20 04:06:42 So. My Dad is my “Market chatter indicator, through limited media. He seems to be able to “channel the message” being pumped out by the “powers that be.” He was all about “cannabis stocks,” and $TLRY THREE DAYS AGO. We all need to have such a ‘market indicator’ to see ‘everything
2589 2018-09-20 04:06:29 Endgame. That's what stocks for me. Who knows.
2590 2018-09-20 04:06:06 Their stocks, sales, whatever, rose slightly cuz all ultra liberals went out and bought anything Nike. Maybe out of spite...maybe knock out some early Xmas shopping while supporting their cause. Whatever the case, ya can’t sustain a profit after insulting half the country
2591 2018-09-20 04:05:50 Its v hard to long these stocks because it goes against every good trading instinct a trader might have. It's so overvalued and so overextended, but its one of my goals to be able to play these in the long. Its tough because you never know when they will drop support and drop 50%

If it wasn’t for daddy’s money he would be in the gutter as the loser he really is.
He would have been richer if he left all his daddy’s money on stocks, which say it all. Please, don’t be stupid!
2601 2018-09-20 03:56:16 One of the first stocks I ever bought was JDSU. It was ~$100/sh. In Feb 1999 (i believe) it went up so much it had 2, 2 for 1 splits that month and ended at $200/sh. I thought I would be rich within months...LOL!

2605 2018-09-20 03:52:38 The pun in the last question makes me unsure if you’re serious. If you are than IDK. I’m sure money could be made in quick trades but long term this seems to be a bubble, but I know 0 about these stocks other than the parabolic move up.

2694 2018-09-20 02:52:14 Ms. Blackburn, I know you took $800,000 from Opioid companies, how much did you take from the NRA? The NRA is a terrorist organization that doesn’t care how many people are killed with assault weapons. Bump Stocks still legal, why?

2697 2018-09-20 02:51:22 Don’t get excited dummy, u obviously misread my tweet. The majority meaning 46% plus the unempl,people in poverty that do not get counted in the work force as well as the retired senior citizens on social security. Well over the majority of Americans don’t get affected by stocks!
2698 2018-09-20 02:50:32 While it appears there is a gender gap, I am a single, 30s male, that has a long past of poor financial habits, and I don't really know a whole lot about financial planning. I put money into stocks a couple times, and I've lost like $1500 in a matter of months. Ha!

2703 2018-09-20 02:49:19 This is very easy to do in US where you are allowed to short any stock and hold it for many days, while on margin. Regulations in India allow only F&O listed stocks to be shorted via Futures. If they allow short selling in stocks in India, the game will change

2712 2018-09-20 02:44:52 Everything is still overvalued. The animal instinct of the crowd to pile up on few tech stocks is wearing off. It’s almost October and the election uncertainty is another wrench tossed in the engine. So, the participants are jittery and will look for any reason to sell. Risk off.

2721 2018-09-20 02:37:51 There were just hundreds of absolute frauds. I became a short seller because I was fascinated by frauds, not stocks that are just overvalued. Even today, 35 years later, I hate to short an overvalued stock. - Tom Barton in @barronsonline
2722 2018-09-20 02:37:34 Our stocks have gone down and we lost money every month for the last year. I suppose I should talk to our investor. We have several accounts. Unemployment is down, there is no doubt. But wages are stagnant and have been. Inflation is up, and that isn't good with no wage gains.
2723 2018-09-20 02:36:55 I just can’t trust Chinese stocks. I love your expertise and I’m looking at possibly adding $VALE, $OFG, and $EC to my mix, but I need value and dividends to hold my interest at this point.

2731 2018-09-20 02:30:23 That being said, I think avg investors should be in funds, much like I think the avg person just shouldn’t hold only 5-10 individual stocks.  Investing in early stage startups outside at least a 25 company portfolio is pretty stupid.

2737 2018-09-20 02:26:03 It is ironic that the loudest proponents of AMC stocks were PMS managers with no skin in the AMC game. You want smart money to come to you and idiot money to go to the AMC. 

Smart money turned into idiot money by the way we invest it. Good to remember that.

2743 2018-09-20 02:22:49 How hard was it to avoid “their stocks are getting high” in the title?
2744 2018-09-20 02:22:04 For everyone trading $TLRY i would advise to not short the backside of the move, regardless of how tempting it is. Stocks with a large retail fan base tend to hold a ton of short traps when its in a mania phase because all first dips are looked at as buying opportunities.
2745 2018-09-20 02:21:06 Thank you Hannah!!

2753 2018-09-20 02:15:32 Agreed and thats why I'm going to keep each contract around $2.50 to 3.50 bc in most cases on a daily basis w/ the right stocks e.g $nflx, $baba, $bidu, $googl, $TSLA & etc, 80%-200% is consistent.

2758 2018-09-20 02:13:24 Great. I am very much willing to learn. I do understand that it’s definitely not easy money. There is a lot of hard work.

To begin with
What is the set up for RSI and MACD that you feeling follow or you have diff setup for diff stocks?

2763 2018-09-20 02:08:39 It won’t last, stocks starting to go down and it may last a few more months.
2764 2018-09-20 02:08:31 It’s still insane to me that marijuana stocks are being traded but you still catch a case for a ounce of mid.
2765 2018-09-20 02:08:09 I like the pairing, but I think a nice Sancerre may be even better, especially with the lemon chicken stocks.

2779 2018-09-20 01:54:41 I feel that cheaper stocks carry more risk then expensive stocks. Do you buy all 100%+ position at once or build the position over time?
2780 2018-09-20 01:54:12 The key to trading stocks successfully & financially is patience. Come to terms with the fact that you or NO ONE can predict or time drops and raises in stock prices. But if the fundamentals checl out, you just buy and hold. It could be for 3 days, 3 weeks or even a year.
2781 2018-09-20 01:53:26 it would be cool if we make it that far
2782 2018-09-20 01:52:07 You mean you can finally afford to short the POT stocks

2809 2018-09-20 01:31:43 I wouldn’t. I’d probably look for a pullback to the 21MA on the daily at around $97-$100 before thinking on buying. I’ve never traded stocks before so i am just guessing.

2813 2018-09-20 01:29:43 Stocks trade at approx 5 mill annually while forex trades at 13-14 trillion annually 
2814 2018-09-20 01:29:18 Thank you so much!
2815 2018-09-20 01:27:38 have to see if it'll hold around that 20MA, either way, I dont care because my average is around $2 sooooo whatever.
2816 2018-09-20 01:26:41 I liked Reilly too, had a quick peek at other hockey forums and fans are trashing Reilly and think Oulette is an option.  I'll just stick with twitter, at least I know the fans I'm associated with aren't smoking dirty turnip stocks.  
2817 2018-09-20 01:26:33 Crypto peeps that started dabbling in pot stocks, I beg of you, please sell while you can

2819 2018-09-20 01:23:55 I went and bought shoes for the family last week, which I do once or twice a year. Bought adidas. Never bought anything other than Nike. We’ll see if their stocks go down or not. I won’t pay money into a race baiting political company who makes their front man a scam artist.

2822 2018-09-20 01:22:49 alright what kinda stocks are you invested in .. I wanna get in on this :D
2823 2018-09-20 01:22:43 That’s why you’re the best. My stocks will double in value by Wednesday guaranteed
2824 2018-09-20 01:22:27 The things that Star Wars blasters tend to have in common that I notice are being based around mid-to-early 20th century firearms with extra scopes, stocks & greeble attached to them, all of it gunmetal grey & weathered. @roger_christian can probably speak better to this than I.
2825 2018-09-20 01:21:38 Seriously, how many average or low income folks really invest in the stock market? Many families live paycheck to paycheck....not a recipe for stock market success. Rich folks got serious tax breaks and are buying stocks to make money for themselves, not improve the economy
2826 2018-09-20 01:21:24 Clearly you don’t understand how important the cod stocks are to the east coast. There actually is a cod fishing season. Just like moose,deer,bird,duck,seal and every other anaimal we can legally hunt.
2827 2018-09-20 01:20:04 Well, I'm still standing. There's too much private stuff to discuss in the public sphere of twitter dot com but overall I'm okay.

also tell the weed stocks to chill tf out for like 5 seconds
2828 2018-09-20 01:18:59 stocks rise in Elon's world.
2829 2018-09-20 01:18:29 $TLRY is something else. That's what happens when you bring speculative weed stocks to Wall Street. Shit was trading like a GD crypto
2830 2018-09-20 01:17:47 My Mom just called me to ask what pot stocks she should buy.

SELL!
2831 2018-09-20 01:17:28 The leftist Dem whackos are literally treasonous. In past times their sorry asses would be in stocks in the public square for ppl to spit on.
2832 2018-09-20 01:17:11 Why's announce these things way before they were in the app? At the end of the day, I am willing to see if Snap can pull this off. I have been here before and it pays to hold through the pain. (Bombardier, Alibaba). Some stocks get sooooo bad that investors throw up their shares.
2833 2018-09-20 01:16:42 Chart looks like hell
2834 2018-09-20 01:16:18 Here is a plug for my friend @KickoStocks . If want to learn more about OTC penny stocks and have a price of a cup of cheap coffee laying around, go see him. He has a fantastic mentor program, complete with all past sessions. He'll even throw in a free pic of his mug!
2835 2018-09-20 01:15:48 The founder and manager of a cannabis portfolio says there's "no branding" in Canadian pot stocks. Lazy, terrible reporting, scaring people into selling. #TLRY #MarleyNaturals #Onelove
2836 2018-09-20 01:15:04 No date no time no place just an obvious delay tactic thats weakening the #MeToo movement shame. Had the letter and a 1-1 meeting and said nothing- take the vote Dems are voting no anyways
2837 2018-09-20 01:14:48 Weed stocks went crazy today
2838 2018-09-20 01:14:12 I like stocks that are above major moving averages.  I also don't like to buy an IPO on the first day. With IPOs you have to expect a lot of selling right off the bat by people who bought off the market so they can be very risky.
2839 2018-09-20 01:13:39 I ever remain PLO, slam like rollerblades 'cross your toenails dreams through the trunk with stocks, wail on the Gods and

2845 2018-09-20 01:11:08 Yes as a country we are safer.  I can now feed my kids.  Crime in our area is down.  The stocks are booming.  My pay is finally getting better instead of worse.  There are jobs & good job offers.  Taxes are strangling my ability to provide basic necessities for my kids.
2846 2018-09-20 01:11:05 That comment was directed at @joebarnoske. He can’t recognize a sinking ship when he sees one. Probably has stocks in the coal industry as well.
2847 2018-09-20 01:10:38 stocks to short or play both ways?
2848 2018-09-20 01:10:19 @kfliptrader. @realsheepwolf. Should find a lot of MMJ and a variety of other OCT stocks floating around these two. If you got a FB I can turn you on to a few good MJ groups that been running for a while.
2849 2018-09-20 01:07:53 Everyone is getting FOMO on cannabis stocks  crypto currency type hype all over again, or maybe there’s really something we don’t know about cannabis to come. Who’s the real ?
2850 2018-09-20 01:07:42 A collective of seniors homes just coordinated the tipping of a tanker of cream of wheat outside of the local shopping mall so they could tag and replenish their resident stocks.
2851 2018-09-20 01:07:36 Long term charts point to this not being true. That being said, I'm not a fan of FAANG companies for how they operate, but as stocks they are admirable.
2852 2018-09-20 01:07:09 I only take risks with my stocks and at the casino
2853 2018-09-20 01:04:34 /me starts buying stocks in drones that can lift 10 people 1/8th of a mile over a 20 foot wall.
2854 2018-09-20 01:03:57 Lol have you seen marijuana stocks. This is nothing.
2855 2018-09-20 01:03:36 If you have a habit of spending to emotionally deal keep a list of stocks or mutual funds that interest you. When the urge hits, buy them. #brokeonpurpose
2856 2018-09-20 01:03:21 Stocks are doing well. So that proves the rich are prospering, but why is overall income at its lowest point in over a decade?
If you’re going to speak the truth speak the whole truth. Don’t be fake news.

2859 2018-09-20 01:01:03 Oh, and bump stocks are still legal. 

Will it take another Vegas-style shooting for legislators to finally do something about it?

How’s that common sense working out for ya?

2863 2018-09-20 00:59:24 What I “needed” was to hold $TLRY during the “right” 5 minutes.  But I stay away from pot stocks.
2864 2018-09-20 00:57:55 @CocaCola considering Cannabidiol #CBD 
CBD a component of the marijuana plant that doesn’t make you high or intoxicated....

Stocks up!
2865 2018-09-20 00:56:50 I regret not buying Netflix, Twitter stocks. 
2866 2018-09-20 00:56:50 No time no place no date no collaborating witnesses just Guilty till proven innocent. Obviously delay tactic shame for weakening the #MeToo movement
2867 2018-09-20 00:55:01 Voilà les stocks de weed qui se sont enflammé comme jamais, des barres
2868 2018-09-20 00:55:00 It was also at 300 today, last week this same thing happen where all the marijuana stocks had a little bit of a pull back $CGC , $CRON .. I don’t see any of them slowing down in the month of September , I bet by Friday, to close, $TLRY touches 300 again
2869 2018-09-20 00:54:44 I can’t accept that algo driven liquidity induced value which exists in every index linked U.S stock today is going to last much longer.  I just can’t.  We’re on the verge of a February redux or worse as every asset across the globe bleeds value other than U.S stocks for months.
2870 2018-09-20 00:54:40 For subscribers of my morning note...

2872 2018-09-20 00:52:47 Try to change the subject? Your delay tactic failed. A complete embarrassment and weakening the #MeToo movement shameful even for a Chinese spy
2873 2018-09-20 00:51:47 If you're trying to beat the market, stocks that are not doing it this late in the year are not your best bet . 
Stocks down ytd in September are there for a reason.
2874 2018-09-20 00:51:20 my style is best described as “didn’t plan to get out of the car”
2875 2018-09-20 00:51:01 And 3 stocks
2876 2018-09-20 00:51:01 $TLRY ‘s tanking would do zilch to the market.

I totally agree with you - but the sideliners who missed the possible 1688% move are fuming  day in and night and trying to put every wrong on $TLRY - I think now they psychologist more than stocks 
2877 2018-09-20 00:49:52 Uranium stocks definitely part of the @CryptoDonAlt hype playbook category. 

Totally agree on e-sports, if you get the right one, investments have potential for huge returns.
2878 2018-09-20 00:49:39 Nra is so excited to announce that it is school shooting season!!!! they will be pushing guns with bump stocks and plenty of ammo. Join the NRA now, and you too can be complicit in thousands of deaths this year!!
2879 2018-09-20 00:48:37 Oh unnie, Ikr how lovable I’m teheee. LOL. I still have a bunch stocks of it. Thankies unnie, welcome to Jennie’s world. Once you get in, you can’t ever escape!
2880 2018-09-20 00:46:44 Heck, why not stocks in the town square?

2884 2018-09-20 00:44:58 That’s all his base focus on, and really, the wealthy, the 10% who own 90% of the stocks, for them, it is the same. The rest of us know better, but get shouted down.
2885 2018-09-20 00:44:29 I have an IRA account that I'm adding stocks like this too, just for the performance and dividends.
2886 2018-09-20 00:43:47 Uranium stocks
2887 2018-09-20 00:42:44 okay but if cube still decides to do this after their stockholders protested it, after stocks fell, after worldwide bad press, and i'm sure dissent from their other idols....then it's unsalvageably stupid as well as petty and cruel.
2888 2018-09-20 00:42:42 Yup that’s pot stocks

2890 2018-09-20 00:40:19 Cannabis stocks like Tilray have skyrocketed, fueled in part by a surge in news coverage & social media posts, according to Bloomberg. Coverage of medical #marijuana has increased from virtually nothing a year ago to more than 6,000 posts a day on #bloomberg.

2892 2018-09-20 00:38:46 I'll take a picture of a graduated student's comment to me on FB, so when I get down or think about getting out ... it will help reinforce why I'm here. Sometimes what we do it like buying stocks - you have to hang in there for the long run in order to "profit" #INeededThat
2893 2018-09-20 00:38:16 Dow climbs, weed stocks go haywire.
Yea! You read it right.

They catching gains on weed on Wall Street but still throwing kids in jail for selling weed on Main Street?
Okay!
2894 2018-09-20 00:38:07 Everyone bought pot stocks on speculation, wait till they need revenues to validate the value.. that's when the "huge pot stock crash" will take effect.
2895 2018-09-20 00:37:57 Eye opener. I have seen tonight’s segment b4 but I learned a LOT more. I have to many stocks, I panic when I have great co’s but they r all down especially with all the sell sell nay sayers & I don’t know when to take profits when it’s doing well. Need a total portfolio scramble
2896 2018-09-20 00:36:04 Careful on MJ stocks. Showing signs of weakness at the moment.
2897 2018-09-20 00:35:24 Pot stocks are higher than American Airlines, Clorox, and CBS. What a fuckin country 
2898 2018-09-20 00:33:15 Dude, you’re never gonna win any beauty pageants yourself — oh but I forgot, you’re a man. Still you’d look great in stocks!
2899 2018-09-20 00:31:37 Great sense of humor Curzio.  Obviously the UFC a few years away.  But you do a fantastic job researching and presenting industries, companies, stocks.
2900 2018-09-20 00:31:24 I wish I had bought stock in @tilray - the cannabis company stocks are up 900%!!!!  Michael Campbell weighs in on that next on @CKNW
2901 2018-09-20 00:30:21 I don't spend my time searching for MA crosses. I buy winners above the 20,50,and 200. 
Great performing stocks can stay above all 3 for a long time.

2905 2018-09-20 00:27:36 Yeah if only I learned how to value stocks better.. then I wouldn't have been in AMD all year.
2906 2018-09-20 00:26:58 EVERY. MORNING. 30 stocks gapped higher.
2907 2018-09-20 00:25:50 Hmm. I read some of the finer print on these gab tokens as well, and something doesn't seem right.. There is a Board of Directors but not A board, and buying Type B Common stocks gives you no rights to anything..

Why not do a Donation? Something seems fishy now.
2908 2018-09-20 00:25:37 'Global Industry Classification Standard' comes into force on Monday. Expect price movements on the massive reclassification of stocks, esp due to passive ETFs.

2912 2018-09-20 00:23:02 Not the only ones ladies. Haven’t seen you on FB in forever then again FB won’t let me even see my own family and friends. Only see you on tweeter. Told FB I hope your stocks tank.

2915 2018-09-20 00:21:59 We should definitely apply the presumption of guilt to EVERY govt employee for every accusation about everything.  Line the mall with pillory stocks.  Break out the tar and feathers. Former gov’t employees too.  Can’t let them escape our wrath!
2916 2018-09-20 00:21:43 Most likely 2020. Increasing global interest rate divergence coupled with overweighting of select few stocks in indexing and ETF illiquidity seem like the obvious culprits.
2917 2018-09-20 00:21:18 You mean it took 2Trillion American taxpayers money to give the Corps & Wall Street big bonuses to buy back their stocks.... that tax cut??
Obama could have spent our money like that & the gdp would have been higher but @ a cost to the taxpayers
2918 2018-09-20 00:21:09 Maybe they dont make money off their subscribers... People that pay them on the other side of the trade... And their expertise in china stocks with his dad connections in china?
2919 2018-09-20 00:20:34 European stocks rose on Wednesday as markets shrugged off concerns over persistent trade spats between the world's two largest economies.
2920 2018-09-20 00:20:29 Idk about that... As @traderstewie pointed out imagine 100 stocks doing this for an entire year. That was the dotcom bubble. This is just 1 psycho IPO with a low float and little competition. I meant personally, more so.
2921 2018-09-20 00:20:06 through which exchange can you short weed stocks or stocks in general and is that with leverage?

2923 2018-09-20 00:19:16 @CryptoSwagy Hi fellow AoT member, which pot stocks you are in or consider yo buy?
2924 2018-09-20 00:17:09 Types of earnings trades:  For many stocks, earnings events cause increased volatility. 1. 2 or  3 weeks prior to earnings announcement look for trade entry points. 2. You can play through earnings using a hedging strategy.  3. You can trade after the event.
2925 2018-09-20 00:16:48 time to short pot stocks. 

am i missing anything in my analysis?
2926 2018-09-20 00:16:34 But with the world and Mexico, RSA, and US stocks, it is hard to get terribly bullish premiums without a massive break in freight (and I’m not sure that even does it).
2927 2018-09-20 00:15:46 US stocks mostly rose Wednesday, led by banks as bond yields hit their highest levels since May amid growing expectations of an acceleration in the pace of interest rate increases, and as markets took a more sanguine view of ongoing global trade conflicts.

2934 2018-09-20 00:12:50 Final trim in #ShortTreasuries (for now) & 2nd run from 1.6% to 3% w/a smaller run btwn is looking damn good. 40% or so in the pocket. 10s bid & rates back down .02%. Let's tank stocks temporarily&let $VIX rip w/ bonds back under 3%. We'll ride vs the #DebtPig again. Biding time
2935 2018-09-20 00:12:18 I'm not sure about the big3 big part because I heard jyp's stocks raised significantly after their tour? but yeah skz is underperforming even more than them in the beginning despite having a whole predebut reality show behind them.

2938 2018-09-20 00:11:34 It is a manipulated short squeeze. There are other weed stocks in the universe, all much cheaper on any relative valuation, but this stock has been cornered. Check out all the deep in the money calls that have been bot and executed in the last 2 weeks. Millions of shares.
