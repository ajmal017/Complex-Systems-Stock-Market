15 2018-05-22 21:55:00 Yes, it is driven by fear. Corporations have done an excellent job of teaching people that as workers they are commodities that can be easily replaced at a better price.
This is harmful to the corporations too, as people who work long hours w/ fractured breaks do shoddy work.

36 2018-05-22 21:04:39 Siempre lo digo. Hay una parte del "pastru" que es inevitable: Los transables que hay dentro del IPC. En particular, commodities agrícolas e industriales. El BCRA puede pelear el traslado a precio a los no transables en CP/MP y TCRM amortiguar en transables no commodities.
37 2018-05-22 21:03:52 Know enough to know they've been confiscating people's wealth via inflation &low deposit rates, forcing them to hide in a rotation of vacant apartments, commodities, stocks, and crypto (or get it out via Macao).

40 2018-05-22 20:40:54 I trade feed commodities and therefore spend a lot of time working with truck drivers.  It's a highly cyclical business.  Fleets/labor expand, rates go down. fleets contract and so on.  One thing that is very much less cyclical...the narrative from the drivers.

43 2018-05-22 20:16:00 We need to change our approach in Africa...we need to stop selling commodities and start manufacturing finished products; cocoa to chocolates, cotton to garments etc...Commodity sales will make us remain the poorest of the poor.

45 2018-05-22 20:01:08 I agree. It is a very slow change, tho. In the meantime, commodities such as wheat and potash sit to make way for trains to carry oil and coal. Oil could easily go by pipe. Coal should be shut down.  And on, and...

54 2018-05-22 19:17:40 Stunning!  There were exceptionally skilled engineers, craftsmen, and metalworkers across Europe, but because Spain had important overland trading routes from the Med to the North Sea it was a place to exchange ideas and skills as much as commodities.
55 2018-05-22 19:11:05 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food

65 2018-05-22 18:27:16 The graph is not known to everybody. Common people paid price for voting BJP in the center. Prices of all commodities will up due to hike in Petrol, Diesel prices. Hope Govt will reduce the tax on petrol & diesel to save common people.
66 2018-05-22 18:19:18 Can’t think of a logical response to a civil conversation so you resort to “jokes” that only you think are funny.  Pst...I’m an analyst in a commodities market, but do go on...
67 2018-05-22 18:15:05 Didn't even get 2.5l fuel in 200 bucks. How the hell is a salaried individual expected to live a decent sustainable life at such price-points of basic commodities? Except for fake assurances and being 'sensitive' to the crisis, what is this regime doing to control the situation?
68 2018-05-22 18:11:05 Golds lack of productivity is in fact reflected in its long term returns whuch underperform 10 year treasuries since gold became free floating. The only thing gold is useful for is a hedge against inflation, much like other commodities.
69 2018-05-22 18:06:04 Why cant the centre take the lead and call a meeting of the states to arrive at some consensus? Oil prices affect the prices of all the commodities throughout the country and the states can not make major changes individually, in isolation. And, this is vox-populi.

74 2018-05-22 17:34:45 Coincido. Igual a todos países les pego igual nada más que algunos habían hecho reformas y tenían colchón fiscal para activar políticas prociclicas (si te bajo el precio de tus commodities aumenta la producción)

86 2018-05-22 17:00:35 Its the culture of the country it is allowed to take place in. Any culture that see people as commodities and at the same time, fails to protect children, can expect to see children exploited and abused. It says how little that culture values childhood and children.

88 2018-05-22 16:52:26 Gas price spikes in 2008-2009 were caused by a massive speculative push by Goldman Sachs in the commodities markets; basically a self fulfilling prophecy they created when the country could afford it least.

90 2018-05-22 16:45:09 The big oil companies raped the land of it's commodity and left. Disgusting way to treat many of these countries who are rich in commodities...the government's politicians who are corrupt make the money...it the same with mining 
91 2018-05-22 16:40:45 a product to empower redistribution of commodities(tangible/intangible) across the globe!
92 2018-05-22 16:40:00 2 proven commodities that will be free agents next year. The above package has 22 years of control. IMO, Moose won't go for much as most contenders will be set at 3B and most not contending will be selling at 3B.
93 2018-05-22 16:39:53 Why are they not bringing petrol under GST.

Why are they levying some ten different taxes. They simply know it will cause big loss to the Exchequer. However this is unfair. When we have GST one single rate on other commodities why not petrol.
94 2018-05-22 16:38:09 I think like essential commodities government also should established a oil prices stability fund to kept at affordable level when it's cheap money that saved should into it but at hike time it should be utilized
95 2018-05-22 16:37:56 That's exactly the point YOUR values & YOUR union

We're your colonial commodities to be used & traded away as YOU see fit & we have no say in the matter
96 2018-05-22 16:37:52 Maybe we are too close but I see Wisler as (God forgive me) the center piece of that deal. Rio stinks, DPete is on DL again & no idea how well he plays when he returns. I just don’t see that being enough for 2 proven commodities.
97 2018-05-22 16:37:13 Why isn't the Congress on the streets protesting against the petrol/diesel prices?Remember how the BJP created havoc with every price rise across commodities??
98 2018-05-22 16:35:16 Tudo isso porque na época da bonança, durante os anos de Lula, qdo as commodities estavam lá em cima e entrava dinheiro a rodo no Brasil, só se preocupavam em roubar para manter seu projeto de poder perene. Não foi feito uma reforma, seja trabalhista, previdenciária ou fiscal.
99 2018-05-22 16:30:44 #BurningBengal ??? really BJP IT cell, really? The only thing that is burning is our pockets & savings due to high petrol pricing that will surely increase prices of daily commodities as well. Wake up bhakts!

Justifican el precio? Esta es la pregunta
107 2018-05-22 16:04:45 You need to understand the principles governing human behaviors. Defined supply and steady demand creates a market for speculators to corner the commodities. And any scarcity, real or rigged, will create more demand and vice a versa. Which in turn impacts price & spiral effects.

125 2018-05-22 15:31:21 I’m a 3rd generation Lonshoreman. We see first hand the cyclical nature of commodities. I believe oil is another that will slowly diminish as new and improved renewable energy comes about. We should be focused on being leaders in that.
126 2018-05-22 15:30:09 Is the commodity era over? Read @WorldCocoa Board Chairman Barry Parkin's five indicators that the era is over as we've known it in @TriplePundithttp://bit.ly/2IFsXwr #SustainableCocoa #Cocoa #Commodities #Procurement
127 2018-05-22 15:28:04 This position aligns with our views about how invaluable women are as people. They are not commodities. Any attempt to put a price on a woman's body is far too cheap. However, my conversations with @AmyDentata would suggest another take on this issue completely.

139 2018-05-22 14:53:23 @prchovanec - Mr. Chovanec. You might like JS Mill on prices.  “If one-half of the commodities in the market rise in exchange value, the very terms imply a fall of the other half; and reciprocally, the fall implies a rise.” Supply constraints balance. It's money value that matter
140 2018-05-22 14:53:01 Is the Government aware of the implications and consequences of the unbridled hike of petrol and diesel prices? Prices of daily commodities have gone beyond the reach of the common people. Even petrol pump owners now feel the pinch and are reported to be on war path.

147 2018-05-22 14:18:11 Apply that thinking to name brands or fetishised commodities in general:  those are products not so much of brainwashing as they are of ideology.  Then there's the rational irrationality of the immense energies wasted on advertisement, instead of better products/services.

You don't ask "enforced how?"

You ask why the fuck they think life can be dictated? Why people can be worked around like chattel again? 

People fought, killed, and died to get beyond this.

151 2018-05-22 14:11:25 Commodities don't just derive value from scarcity, they are also used in the economy to build goods and services. A currency is used to purchase these goods and services. Currencies are also bought and sold depending on the real rate of return being offered.
152 2018-05-22 14:10:25 Only the stupid or infantile or selfish or economic illiterates believe that govt can or should control prices of commodities including petrol and diesel. A society of such mediocre people is condemned to be always abjectly poor. #PetrolPrice

China agreed to buy food & energy at a higher rate. The joint statement has no commits. 

Both are commodities, so the economic value of exports vs consuming in the US is negligible.

And as both are perishable, they only bought what they would have always bought.
200 2018-05-22 11:49:24 price hike of fuel directly influnce all other commodities. If it is a short term event, we are ready to bear the cost, but as it seems that the crude oil price will increase more, then clearly this is not a good arrangement to get the funding. Need to be more innovative.

219 2018-05-22 10:13:30 People shouldnt then forget that they are commodities. Once money is exchanged, there is no say from the purchase.

221 2018-05-22 10:06:28 @AmitShah People still do not have the hope that the price of essential commodities will come down after GST. It is either a mistake or misunderstanding of the state governments, or that the proper intervention of the center does not exist.
222 2018-05-22 10:05:04 Petrobras alega que alta nos combustíveis está 100% ligada ao valor do barril do petróleo, uma vez que são commodities com preços atrelados ao mercado internacional.

229 2018-05-22 09:12:06 Thanks to the TRAIN law, cost of living in Metro Manila has increased to a point where that incremental 4K you’re getting to your wage means nothing, while corrupt officials get to keep that tax you’re giving them on these commodities 
230 2018-05-22 09:06:59 Dr Maxwell Mudhara, Director of @UKZN's Farmer Support Group #Ukulinga: The dismantling of SA's agricultural commodities marketing boards was prejudicial to small-scale farmers. They now struggle to compete against larger-scale farmers & imports.
231 2018-05-22 08:54:00 Only on papers not on ground , I am a big fan of modi ji , he is doing incredible job on many fronts but I bet and challenge you he did nothing as for as price rises of common commodities are concern . GST was a flop move , give me one example where GST is proven beneficial .
232 2018-05-22 08:52:03 On the directions of Deputy Commissioner Mardan Muhammad Usman Mahsud, Assistant Commissioner Mardan Imran Khan continued crack down against the butchers and Meat shops,food stuffs rate List and other commodities in Beijli gar... 3 offenders arrested ...
233 2018-05-22 08:46:50 That's before you consider Bauer who's been a revelation, along with Pieters who has stepped his game back up. Veterans like Grant, Johnson & Adam. Due to poor form, I can't see too many leaving, and we can replace players with known commodities like a Gayle or Afobe.
234 2018-05-22 08:39:45 now the country gets self sufficient in both commodities should export surplus yield n earn foreign exchange desperately needed to ex checker

239 2018-05-22 08:09:31 Not only that think of transportation cost of goods. It will lead to increase in price of all commodities. Bus ticket prices will go up. As you said today bike is not a luxury. But any amount logic will not convince bhakts.
240 2018-05-22 08:08:39 In a funny sort of way I think it *has* become more welcoming to *migration* as people are sold this idea of only having the people the country wants. But it has become *less* welcoming to *migrants* as in this model they are just commodities here to serve their nativist masters.
241 2018-05-22 08:08:18 MLAs are not commodities to buy or take in if they are free! That’s called Inducement, the so called crime Right wingers accuse of religious conversions! @SreenivasanJain
242 2018-05-22 08:05:47 Sierra Leone is facing a years-long slump in commodities prices that has held up development of large-scale iron ore mining projects. The #Ebola crisis paralyzed the country in 2014 & 2015.

The economy contracted by more than 20 percent in 2015 and is yet to fully recover.

#Commodities
244 2018-05-22 07:54:22 In a volatile market one must invest in commodities sure to increase in value, such as silly plastic eyes.
245 2018-05-22 07:51:07 Though plastic is biggest pollutant of the environment but majority of eatables are packed in the plastic bags .The gen public , vendors  & shopkeepers also use polythene bags to bring vegetables,fruits and other commodities .  Ban  manufacturing  of such bags world wide.
246 2018-05-22 07:50:15 At the core of this idea is the idea that women are commodities to be given to men who’re so awful they can’t get laid on their own and might go on a killing spree because of it. There’s no way around that. No matter what angle you’re approaching it from.
247 2018-05-22 07:45:35 The philosopher doesn't sell services as commodities.
248 2018-05-22 07:39:42 RANCHI: #FuelPricesHike in the state are set to touch an all-time high and a hike in prices of all other commodities as a cascading effect is bound to follow soon with the Union petroleum ministry hinting at an increase of Rs 4 per litre on existing petrol and diesel prices.
249 2018-05-22 07:04:19 Within four days,,,,second time increase.......Petrol bomb is killing all of us, as it is related with the prices of all essential commodities.... Lets us pray and wish some state elections are declared today....then only we can be sure from Petrol Bomb.....
250 2018-05-22 07:03:56 hahha. no problems. Looks like it has played its hand. Best way to see where commodities are going is to technical analysis. fundamentals follow technicals here since numbers are reported with a lag
251 2018-05-22 06:52:47 RANCHI: Fuel prices in the state are set to touch an all-time high and a hike in prices of all other commodities as a cascading effect is bound to follow soon with the Union petroleum ministry hinting at an increase of Rs 4 per litre on existing petrol and diesel prices.
252 2018-05-22 06:45:59 Oh for gods sake you sound like Trump and his ridiculous boasting. All you're going to do is make fossil commodities a luxury that the poor can't afford - you're already partway there thanks to the DWP.
253 2018-05-22 06:44:03 The common man is the one at loss increased fuel prices is directly proportional to the rise in price of daily commodities and needs. Is this the ACHE DIN promised to us? #FuelLootBySuitBoot @divyaspandana @JebiMather @HasibaAmin @Allavaru @chandruthiru @chand_dr @ThiruArasarINC
254 2018-05-22 06:39:43 and that's the problem isn't it. If you're selling commodities you're a price taker at the mercy of large corporations who will drive down the farm gate price. If you're marketing branded product you're a price maker and the world is your oyster :)
255 2018-05-22 06:38:34 Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality 
256 2018-05-22 06:34:08 Been a lil over a yr and I’ve flipped multiple homes in Texas. Haven’t quite got on the list I want with roadside. Psychology track is going great and doing good with trading commodities now. The +\- have been crazy this last 16 mo or so.  Bless up!
257 2018-05-22 06:32:51 It doesn’t apply to commodities. The majority of people will never buy wheat or other grains from the farm gate. Milk is not allowed to be sold raw in many places.
258 2018-05-22 06:31:43 No it isn’t a punishment when they can sell to another customer/country. That’s my point. You said China has influence because of its economy but a lot of the “influence” is in commodities trade. Therefore I think you overstate the influence
259 2018-05-22 06:26:51 Some well educated people from abroad are prepared 2 do jobs they’re overqualified for due 2 there being no jobs in their own country or their qualifications aren’t recognised in the UK. But speaking about them as if they’re commodities 4 immigration purposes dehumanises them.
260 2018-05-22 06:17:37 Hence it’s hard to punish a country in commodities trade as the markets will just shuffle.
261 2018-05-22 06:12:31 COMMODITIES ROUND-UP : METALS AND OIL #SFX #Forex2018 May 22, 2018 at 07:12AM #ForexMay
262 2018-05-22 06:07:08 That’s doesn’t address my point that lot of trade with China is in commodities and it’s hard to punish a trade partner if you’re only trading in commodities. USA historical embargo’s on Iran is a case in point in that for many years Iran would just sell to India and Japan instead
263 2018-05-22 05:54:51 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the mines which produce them. #TuesdayThoughts @NSEIndia
264 2018-05-22 05:54:34 I find quite a bit of China economic trade to be as important to China as to the trade partners. A lot is straight commodities. Yes you can go by the iron ore or soy from another country but it all just becomes a global market shuffle where the price will stay similar.
265 2018-05-22 05:49:03 Hindus must start similar protests everywhere Hindu temples are under government control. Hindu temples are not mere properties or commodities to be exploited.
266 2018-05-22 05:45:06 I mean, that’s nice and all, but more and more of the backend will prove to be commodities. Doesn’t matter, you won’t need 70% of your existing staff at that point no matter whether you’re paying Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or whoever. (The humans lose, as always.)
267 2018-05-22 05:41:51 Everything at a all time high.
With the rising prices of petrol,  diesel, cooking gas, vegetables and all essential commodities 
The aam aadmi is feeling the pinch and struggling to stabilize the monthly budget. 
@INCIndia @RahulGandhi
@rssurjewala @SinghRPN
268 2018-05-22 05:38:55 Yep. The only hope for property investors is that the world takes a sudden downturn where commodities and everything falls. RBA and other central banks would immediately drop rates to 0 or negative and print money which would probably save property again.
269 2018-05-22 05:36:34 I mean I think the problem starts when you transform games into commodities. Lootboxes are just an extension of that. The mechanisms for producing profit are more transparent, but it's same underlying logic.
270 2018-05-22 05:35:28 Kuch bhi  Daal chawal rate atleast google karlo agar grocery shopping nahi karte ho toh. Aur yeh tweet ka ya matlab yeh tha ki pehle petrol ke hisab commodities prices badh jaate the ab nahi ho raha 
271 2018-05-22 05:31:17 The very reasons Germany runs trade surpluses with China are: 

1. They don’t sell commodities, they sell engineered solutions. Hence hard to copy by the Chinese. Must tighter licensing agreement. 

2. German MNCs tend to favor German suppliers, unlike the American counterparts.
272 2018-05-22 05:28:56 Indeed, per US IRS, SARS, MFČR, ..., bitcoin is an intangible asset. Per US CFTC, bitcoin is a commodity. It seems that you are also right it is the first one, since older intangibles such as patents, copyrights, etc. are not commodities.
273 2018-05-22 05:27:58 Raising prices of all essential commodities is not the best solution for fuel price hikes.
Governments better think!!!
274 2018-05-22 05:14:15 @RahulGandhi Rahulji, what are your plans for  2019, and how r v planning 2 tackle the concern of price rise of fuel and other essential commodities. These r the concerns of the common man when we promote our party. I hope v will have a real solution for it when v come to power

279 2018-05-22 04:38:14 @narendramodi  petrol price 84.70 RS . is this are acche din? It is been said India is the 6th Richest country in the world so is this the reason your government is continuously hiking price  on all commodities. We don't want bullet train we want peace and safety traveling.
280 2018-05-22 04:37:13 The increase in petroleum tax provision of the TRAIN Law is helping the rise of inflation on basic goods and commodities. That provision should be eased out of the law as it is not helpful to the country, in reality.
281 2018-05-22 04:19:36 @narendramodi sir common man are started suffering because of Petrol Price . why cant intervene  in petrol prices.. it may cause rise in commodities
282 2018-05-22 04:14:02 MERCADO DE BIENES BÁSICOS: En los commodities, el oro bajó 0.25% a ($1,288.10dpb); el Brent subió 0.04% ($78.54dpb), mientras que el WTI subió 0.56% ($71.68dpb).
283 2018-05-22 04:09:54 Economic terminology does not at all imply human relationships are *just* commodities, or that women are objects. That being said, sex and relationships are market-based to such a degree that they overlap significantly with the actual market economy.
284 2018-05-22 04:07:15 Where have you read that prices of basic commodities didn't rose? Price of an commodity is highly dependant on Oil Prices and when Modi came in power crude oil price decreased due to shale gas discovery in USA , despite low crude oil price ,price of commodities increased.(1/2)
285 2018-05-22 04:01:18 And if fuel costs low commodities will be cheaper 
That is it
286 2018-05-22 03:59:36 Não é só isso, o petróleo é uma commodities, o preço flutua de acordo com o preço no mercado internacional. Não tem como controlar, o que pode ajudar e muito é a reforma fiscal, fora isso não tem como dar novos subsídios, foi o que a Dilma fez e todos nós conheceremos o final!
287 2018-05-22 03:59:21 The last one (administrative mark-ups) are fundamentally unpredictable. As we learned in the 1970s, the demand-pull channel (commodities) is also unpredictable & heavily influenced by political events. The wage-cost channel has been written about for decades (read: Philips Curve)
288 2018-05-22 03:52:03 That’s good logic .. the producer has an asset that can be priced well .. and commodities fetch maximum price at maximum demand ..
289 2018-05-22 03:50:53 My dad left when I was 14. I was raised by my mother and two sisters. I never for a second wish that he had come back to raise me. They taught me valuable lessons. The only thing they taught me about “navigating the sexual marketplace” was that women are people. Not commodities.
290 2018-05-22 03:40:53 @TokenZnx are not stocks, commodities or investment, #ZNC is the use of the token in the domestic markets. Items worldwide can buy using cryptocurrency and token #ZNC. #zcnox
291 2018-05-22 03:31:25 Crip does have the potential to change this in a big way allowing the common folk access to the commodities exchange for elite is not something that should never be taken away even if they can lose everything

293 2018-05-22 03:14:01 Russia was providing Germany with commodities right up to German invasion of Poland.

Gold was steady at $1,292.76 an ounce.

LME copper rose 0.2 percent to $6,890 a metric ton
295 2018-05-22 03:05:23 Is that the only way to prove our patriotism?? Have you bothered about the unemployment and rising prices of petrol which in turn will affect other commodities... Get your priorities right.. If the citizens are suffering from basic needs, thrust nationalism in.. Wah 
296 2018-05-22 03:04:11 SEBI may make it difficult for retail investors to bet on commodities.
297 2018-05-22 02:57:23 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
298 2018-05-22 02:54:39 The government is devaluing us as a nation, other countries by our commodities because we supply high quality goods. If we dont stand up for the Australian way we risk loosing our moral compass.
299 2018-05-22 02:45:36 Except muslim women, who understand he makes life easier for them by keeping the prices of essential commodities under check and preventing men from using them as mere children producing machines, cook, baby sitter and a house maid
300 2018-05-22 02:38:37 INSPIRED WORDS are the most precious commodities ever known...They convey divine energies...They ignite the hope of the hopeless and inject faith into the faithless. #WisdomMakesTheDifference #KeepAdvancing! #drIykeNwambie
301 2018-05-22 02:33:01 Dominguez: tax package has been unfairly blamed for elevated inflation; April’s 4.5% inflation is typical of rapidly expanding economy, the rest due to sharp increases in key imported commodities like oil, realignment of currency exchange rates @ANCALERTS
302 2018-05-22 02:26:56 Healthcare isn't like other commodities.  People.seldom get to comparison shop and they don't question their providers about costs before getting services. Lack of choices and the real worries about quality make for captive consumers.  Medicare for all, please!
303 2018-05-22 02:23:00 Thanks EK - I very much appreciate your thoughts on $JNUG.  Are you expecting $5.50 as the final low for $DRIP before a significant bounce?  It's really gotten killed.  I suppose commodities are on a rise finally.
304 2018-05-22 02:22:06 @dpradhanbjp & @narendramodi , sir just want to know if the increase in #petrol price is after effect of #KarnatakaElectionResults .
