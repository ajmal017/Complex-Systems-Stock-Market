7 2018-10-17 23:58:40 You can get it at Walgreens in the vitamin aisle, make sure the only ingredient in it is coconut oil.
8 2018-10-17 23:58:38 Truffle oil sends everyone home on chopped, come on people don’t you know this!
9 2018-10-17 23:58:31 Thank you indeed. Please punish them and hit them hard. What a shameless heartless way of treating a human being who went to his consulate for assistance and instead got brutally dismembered. So impunity because of their oil and money.
10 2018-10-17 23:58:29 No coconut oil lying around?
11 2018-10-17 23:58:27 there is no good way you should know about moroccan argan oil
12 2018-10-17 23:58:26 Off course it is, but whenever you flash dollar signs in front of most Western governments they turn a blind eye to this, which is shameful.  If Saudi Arabia wasn't on one of the biggest oil reserves they wouldn't be getting the Western support they are.

31 2018-10-17 23:58:02 Saudis hide behind their oil. They hold the world hostage with it.  Think they can get away with murder
32 2018-10-17 23:58:01 U.S will be the first to suffer without S.A imagine just the Saudis would sell oil by any currency other than US dollars your entire economy will collapse with in less 3 years !! 
know your enemies and your friends bro 
33 2018-10-17 23:58:01 Due to higher oil prices and less supply nd demand yes

35 2018-10-17 23:57:56 @Petron_Malaysia Good quality oil but y most of d time d credit card facility at d pump station @ Petron in front of Star Avenue Subang  is offline? Esp for diesel purchase. Pls rectify this to ensure customers convenience.
36 2018-10-17 23:57:36 A decade or so ago, Eastern Europeans moved to the UK, were trained and integrated into UK companies, now more economical for those companies to have them move home and set up their buying operations there. Oil is a prime example.
37 2018-10-17 23:57:32 @StephMillerShow @nytimes are too polite to the Proud Boys, @CNN thinks the Dems won't get the Senate but neglects to say why, and Trump says "Oh, well" over #KhashoggiMurder because we're oil addicts.
This isn't the govt of DeSade, for DeSade,  by DeSade! VOTE!

39 2018-10-17 23:57:21 Stormy Daniels is of no effect on our economy, geo politics, price of oil and military allies you dolt
40 2018-10-17 23:57:14 Saudi is not our friend .I hear so many times "Saudi is  am ally" .I heard it this week. They are behind terrorist activity ,may be our worst enemy, and liberals want to buy oil from the killers.
41 2018-10-17 23:57:14 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
42 2018-10-17 23:57:07 มันเป็นคอนเซ็ป...ต้องหลับ
43 2018-10-17 23:56:58 he's right, for max effect cover somewhat snugly with tin foil 

the cheese steams back to gooey and the bottom gets crispy from the oil, ancient goon techniques
44 2018-10-17 23:56:56 depending on the pizza you might need to throw a lil oil in there, not a lot, and you can't turn the heat up too high or else the crust will burn faster than the cheese will re-melt. but it's the best way to enjoy reheated pizza and I cannot recommend it enough
45 2018-10-17 23:56:45 Anyone who has ever used CBD oil for anxiety or known anyone to use it please give me all the information! Very interested in getting some.
46 2018-10-17 23:56:35 t-rump will likely oil up his twitter machinery and take shots at the press
47 2018-10-17 23:56:35 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
48 2018-10-17 23:56:34 What is up with these chefs in food network abusing truffle oil? HAVEN’T YOU LEARNED THAT YOU SHOULD’T USE MUCH OF IT
49 2018-10-17 23:56:30 I've made the @Wichcraft tuna melt with roasted tomatoes and Gruyère and it's kind of perfect. Canned tuna with olive oil rather than water makes a huge difference.
50 2018-10-17 23:56:25 We've already done so much damage that the only way back is literally to reverse our tech.  Worldwide end to all use of fossil fuels.  No more coal, oil or natural gas.  No products made from them.  That would likely lead to a 75% reduction in population in 20 years or less.
51 2018-10-17 23:56:25 Add black pepper to that turmeric with a little olive oil.
52 2018-10-17 23:56:25 Why you raising the price of gas while working with the oil and gas industry in Texas ? That is a tax on the people of Texas ! Thanks Ted ! Wrong for working people !
53 2018-10-17 23:56:17 Masuk oil & gas pulak. Macam nice jugak. Masyukk
54 2018-10-17 23:56:11 Not.good.enough. Too greedy nad too weak to have been effective. Stupid decision not to go in with Gordon Brown's Labour. Nick cleggs vanity at being woo'd for Depty PM  was his undoing. He fell for Cameron's  oil charm, rather than working with grumpy but effective Brown
55 2018-10-17 23:56:10 We will never run out of oil, due to the last few barrels of oil costing billions of dollars.
56 2018-10-17 23:56:05 Did they ever explain why 18 of the 9/11 hijackers were from their country?  They are ruthless monarchy who have oil.
57 2018-10-17 23:55:55 Not everyone in oil in Saudi Arabia  murdered that reporter  do business with them and nail the fuckers who murdered him
58 2018-10-17 23:55:54 Pro-PUK weekly Zhyan revealed that a group of KDP secuirty personnel have been arrested on charges of oil smuggling, the KRG Spokesperson confirmed it, however, head of Erbil KDP Security refuted the allegation. It is said that one of the top Masrour Barzani's men is in the list.

61 2018-10-17 23:55:48 It's something how Crohn's disease is affecting people globally...makes ya wonder. I know of someone who has it and they found CBD oil to be their magic bullet.
62 2018-10-17 23:55:48 Unless, totally hypothetically, sustained low interest rates and low oil prices led to a wave of new car sales which creates a glut of used cars, depressing resale values when the cycle turns ;)

71 2018-10-17 23:55:07 It’s still early in the investigation but I agree likely nothing will be done.  They were also largely behind 9/11 and nothing was done by 43 or 44.  Oil money talks

82 2018-10-17 23:54:08 We  have the entire world to trade with. Please do some homework on crude oil, refineries, the dairy product market and on and on. You are ill informed and it shows. You have no vested interest in the US. Stay in your place and enjoy your ignorance.
83 2018-10-17 23:53:50 It’s refreshing to hear about an administration who is welcoming to the energy industry. We in Canada are not so lucky. Until new technologies provide the same level of service that natural resources do, we should continue to support oil/ gas/ coal production.
84 2018-10-17 23:53:49 And who is reading “Bloggers” stuff?  Bloggers are girls who have Popsockets and drink Starbucks brah.  Jake isn’t listening to fools out there.  He just needs some CBD oil to calm down.
85 2018-10-17 23:53:45 Trump must be commended for one huge thing though. His snake oil is so potent! That snake oil has half the country in a spell, even those never Trumper GOP senators were caught in it's spell! Amazing stuff he's got, hope November 6 is the anti venom!

93 2018-10-17 23:52:26 Also, the Track Tactix is a good ball, but definitely works better Medium oil for me than Medium-Heavy.
94 2018-10-17 23:52:18 It's basil and oil.
95 2018-10-17 23:52:06 Yeah, I love the argument that we spent $1 trillion on a war so hopefully we could make a few billion dollars off Middle Eastern oil.
96 2018-10-17 23:52:05 my car is the easiest to learn on, but i’d need an oil change before i’d let you try

98 2018-10-17 23:51:58 Saudis fund all the Wahhabism schools that teach millions of Muslims to hate America
9/11 was basically an all Saudi attack on America
Now they Kill & dismember a WP reporter
Um... what do they have that we so desperately want? Oil? Perhaps. Money? Yeah
99 2018-10-17 23:51:56 natural gas isn't oil.

104 2018-10-17 23:51:26 earlier my sister & i went to autozone to get some oil & i was like why don’t u put it in rn & she was like “the car has to be cold” & i was like oo i didnt know that & she was like “all u know how to do is waste gas, maybe u should learn more about cars” like this bitch did not
105 2018-10-17 23:51:12 If we're going to be real, US presidents have been covering for Saudi excesses at varying degrees for a century. Mainly for oil and anti-communism
106 2018-10-17 23:51:08 ...oil...

108 2018-10-17 23:50:46 Inner term oil on whether to watch AHS and likely scar my conservative father or watch riverdale and wonder what’s happening on ahs
109 2018-10-17 23:50:45 If the Saudis indeed are, and it looks like they are, guilty of this, the solution is pretty simple. 
Close all of their consulates and impose no fly/no trade. They can't eat oil.

Anyone trading with them gets the same treatment.

I'll pay 10 bucks a gallon to see it happen.
110 2018-10-17 23:50:39 preserve me in a vat of truffle oil when I die
111 2018-10-17 23:50:26 What in the hell does the Saudis have on the United States? Every president we’ve had think the Saudis walk on water. It can’t just be oil because we have our own. Is it because they buy our weapons just like Israel?
112 2018-10-17 23:50:18 I should’ve bought that eucalyptus oil 
113 2018-10-17 23:49:52 The new favorite tools. Trained my 2nd try harder ;) Have to be oil draped…
114 2018-10-17 23:49:44 I can’t do oil at all. I hate the smell and taste of weed SO much. I can barely do edibles - just the gummies that I cut in pieces and swallow whole!
115 2018-10-17 23:49:42 Did @OleHenriksen change formulas recently? The oil control mattifying moisture creme doesn’t seem to have spf anymore & is no longer carried at Sephora anyway. #Help
116 2018-10-17 23:49:35 Our company is the ONLY mlm CBD OIL company to be able to legally ship our products to CANADA!  Want to join us for FREE? Say me!!
117 2018-10-17 23:49:28 It’s sooooo upsetting and frustrating.  We can do our part as best we can, but unless politicians start doing something soon, we should just rise up and fucking siege oil refineries ourselves.
118 2018-10-17 23:49:21 Every other president has been friendly with Saudi Arabia because of oil and other reasons, but they didn't have personal business ties to the Saudis like Trump does. This is a whole new level of corruption.
119 2018-10-17 23:49:19 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
120 2018-10-17 23:49:09 Friendly wager? Next oil canucks game, oil win you wear a dangercats shirt to one of your shows, canucks win @UncleHack69 will wear a default or dallassmith shirt in one of the next videos!!
121 2018-10-17 23:49:09 Charge the guy with part of a planed murder. End oil purchases and buy elsewhere.
122 2018-10-17 23:49:01 #Beto - knows how to avoid answering question.

While oil is booming in the Permian Basin & because all Trump has done – including the huge drop in unemployment –  Oil companies need more workers.

#Beto wants to tax YOU - $10 per barrel & promotes WIND Power

$83M wasted on him
123 2018-10-17 23:48:52 Oh my, those thighs are juicy 
124 2018-10-17 23:48:42 Is anyone surprised? Our money, oil, and debts are tied to Saudi and the royal family
125 2018-10-17 23:48:40 Let's be clear.  Saudia Arabia killed 3000 Americans on 9/11 and NOTHING HAPPENED to me.

127 2018-10-17 23:48:27 Coconut oil helps a lot! But it makes your hair oily sometimes, I usually shampoo twice
128 2018-10-17 23:48:27 I've heard it's good stuff but I've never smoked anything ever so now that it's legal here I might try and find oil somewhere
129 2018-10-17 23:48:26 I don’t know how any reasonable oilman can be happy with trump - he keeps making noises about increased oil imports from OPEC and from the Crazy Criminal Saudis - now question of him having business interest there - and profiting from them - THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ILLEGAL -
130 2018-10-17 23:48:26 If one were totally cynical you could argue she's married to an oil guy, Simon has a bit of a thing for oil producers... The rest I'll leave to the dude in the unmarked van clutching a phone and talking quickly I just saw to write up ;) Bet I can find that theory on Facebook!!
131 2018-10-17 23:48:18 Murdered and butchered a critical journalist. Just too far opposed to American values. We don’t need their oil, their money nor their atrocities in Yemen staining our proud flag.

144 2018-10-17 23:46:49 Yet the United States does business with Saudi Arabia. You realize we don’t need their Oil . We have our own and plenty of it. So what’s the deal?
145 2018-10-17 23:46:39 Isn't it time for you to change the oil in your hair?
146 2018-10-17 23:46:30 Hot oil treating my hair overnight. And tying up my hair to go to class tomorrow. 
147 2018-10-17 23:46:19 It isn't Oil.... it is Dirt on Trump.  He has done business with them for years and years...and we know #ManBaby doesn't do any business with honesty.
148 2018-10-17 23:46:10 Hot oil treatment anyone ?  #BlackGirlBible
149 2018-10-17 23:46:04 Major beneficiary of Khoushugi issue is US. Ask many time to KSA to maintain oil prices but KSA didn't. Sure oil price will be in accord to US' desire.

He’s using everything he has to try and slow her down, throwing a smoke bomb on the floor before throwing caltrops on the ground, and slick oil a few-

154 2018-10-17 23:45:32 Yes, bkos how would they have manage this fall of oil price  in 2015 with d spat of looting , stealing, carrying, corruption, free for all, etc under GEJ nose. We would have been beggars now. No import substitution coz Nigeria would have bn a dumping ground. Waivers to big shots

157 2018-10-17 23:45:30 Changed a 50 year old mans life last night (his words)
Dude has chronic pain, tumors, cancer & now a failing liver from the pills. Hooked him up with his 1st ever joint last night & a swig of cbd oil. He slept like a baby & had no pain. He placed his 1st order with the OCS today.

160 2018-10-17 23:45:08 Scientists on the other “side” are oil lobbyists, not scientists.
161 2018-10-17 23:44:59 Could be your oil pump going out.  I wouldn't drive it you might throw a rod.
162 2018-10-17 23:44:53 Yup! Same here. When I learned that certain strains had lower THC and a higher CBD (the counteractive chemical to help the mellow) I was like....ohhhhhhhhhh! Have had really good luck there. Also had good pain management w a pinched nerve with CBD oil.
163 2018-10-17 23:44:51 I got oil on my face again... How does it even get there...? -bot-
164 2018-10-17 23:44:48 What do you recommend as an oil cleanser?
165 2018-10-17 23:44:43 plenty of water , no candy or choc, vit D  supplement. olive oil for cooking. wash face with cool water and  non- perfumed soap . use head and shoulders shampoo. pat your face dry with towel. 

all little things to help .

ifcall else fails got to docs .x

and try not to stress x

They said it will be an hour. 

It’s been 2 hours and I’m still waiting......
168 2018-10-17 23:44:17 Voice of a snake oil salesmen for the last 50 years.... Jesus already saved you once, now your sins are on your ass and no one else’s... and yes... I love to throw stones....

171 2018-10-17 23:43:31 Fed Reserve Chrmn Jerome Powell needs to have a better understanding of inflation in relation to the price of OIL.

174 2018-10-17 23:43:10 I’ve seen two “what essential oil can *insert impossible deed here*” tweets and if it doesn’t become a trend I will be highly upset
175 2018-10-17 23:43:03 I've just got some cbd oil and so far not noticed any difference. Hope I've just not got the dose right yet
176 2018-10-17 23:42:51 It’s a very simple game : they might have a recording probably illegally obtained. The other side has income of about a billion a day from oil. They say in a Stormy Daniels voice give us 20 billion and we give you the recording and an NDA. The other side says five billion ....
177 2018-10-17 23:42:37 This is bizarrely accurate.

180 2018-10-17 23:42:03 Butter/Oil, low heat, apply eggs, stir in pan.
181 2018-10-17 23:42:03 As a chef, I'd rather use stainless steel cookware. They do stick. But if you use enough oil or butter you stop the food from sticking. Also if you wipe them with some oil after you clean them, it helps as well. Just my thoughts and preferences
182 2018-10-17 23:41:59 it’s the sunflower seed oil in it :/// i had a craving a few months ago and didnt even think to check the ingredients and all of a sudden i had hives
183 2018-10-17 23:41:58 Sounds like u could have an electrical issue with ur oil light.U might want to have someone check the wiring to ur oil light. As for ur car smelling like gas.Ur fuel line might be flooded with gas Go to a mechanic tell him to check ur fuel line and ur oil light.
184 2018-10-17 23:41:53 CBD oil has changed my life of migraines for the better.
185 2018-10-17 23:41:52 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo No amount of money no amount of oil no relationship is worth the integrity of U.S. when it comes to bringing the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia before a U.N.

188 2018-10-17 23:41:28 I take issue that you insinuate that I don't support vets or patients. I have ancestors that have fought in every war that the USA has been involved in. Including the revolutionary war. And my Mother-in-law uses cannabis oil for pain. Which is legally available over the counter.

191 2018-10-17 23:41:05 Hey, I appreciate that. And I understand that fossil fuels are needed now. I don’t think oil is evil. I drive a gas-powered SUV.  

Can we get one thing straight about teachers though? About 95% of us do not want guns in our classrooms, even if we’re the ones carrying them.
192 2018-10-17 23:41:00 Our newest #REALiceCA arena is Tommy Ricketts Arena, where until now they heated resurfacing water to 160F using almost 6,000 litres of heating oil per season. REALice helps eliminate oil used as heating source. #sustainability

197 2018-10-17 23:40:00 He lowered the taxes for companies to stay competitive with the rest of the world to build factories here. The stock market has been booming. He lowered taxes on the middle class. Car and house market are booming. Has made America a key contributor in selling oil.
198 2018-10-17 23:39:54 Soooo I need refill oil for my pen....didn’t quite think this convenience factor thru
199 2018-10-17 23:39:47 Well played Canada. With the quantity of migrants receiving all those freebees, carbon tax and an oil industry in the toilet. Shouldn't be another year before the country is bankrupt.  Justin time to hand over to the conservatives and blame it all on them.  What a bunch of fools.
200 2018-10-17 23:39:44 Don’t  don’t risk it getting into the oil, these 2v’s break rods too easy, just find another manifold, I had to get a new one cause mine cracked too
201 2018-10-17 23:39:41 My coconut oil is solid which means it’s time to find a bae
202 2018-10-17 23:39:38 A real Texan than wants to ban the most popular gun in America? A real Texan that wants to cripple the Texas oil and gas industry with taxes and regulations? A real Texan that wants to open the flood gates at the border by decriminalizing illegal entry? Give me a fucking break.
203 2018-10-17 23:39:30 Forced population reduction ON PURPOSE?? Or is it just that Burma has no oil??
204 2018-10-17 23:39:27 Yes for medical reasons, I have MS, Lupus and FND.. I was taking masses of pain killers, nerve pain killers, muscle relaxers.. but I was still in pain, I’ve sourced illegal home made cannabis oil (not the stuff you buy in the shop) it was a sample and 5 drops I was pain free!
205 2018-10-17 23:39:24 tea tree and rosemary oil so strong 
206 2018-10-17 23:39:22 Coconut oil?
207 2018-10-17 23:39:21 Oh yes, that too. And the increase in discretionary spending families have in our area when oil is high.
208 2018-10-17 23:39:14 And 2 of my brothers are well known. 1 has 1 arm & 1 leg & is a paralympic cycler. Todd Key. The other was the CEO of a large defense & oil contractor. I won't name him. Tho we all have the last same last name--you know descendants of Francis Scott Key!
#ChangetheAnthem
209 2018-10-17 23:39:10 No.  Oil and Gas Feeds my Family and has for 40 years.  You need to educate yourself.
210 2018-10-17 23:39:05 Ya.....first time ever in #yeg when a different kind of oil was trending!
211 2018-10-17 23:38:54 Using peppermint oil and then drinking hot apple cider....not a great experience.
212 2018-10-17 23:38:45 On reloaded to season the cast iron you said it can be done two or three times. Does that mean two or three times of heat? Or two or three times of heat plus oil?
213 2018-10-17 23:38:30 chili oil girls? haha
214 2018-10-17 23:38:13 Look how cheap #Trump is! Hey #MAGAts he only got 100 million from the rich oil prince!
215 2018-10-17 23:38:03 When oh when(if ever) will they realise the oil belongs to the UK under the Continetal Shelf agreement. UK waters not Scottish
216 2018-10-17 23:38:00 Yes, this is indicative of intentional sabotage of the process I described earlier. Our entire world is transitioning away from fossil fuels. It is going to happen whether the oil companies like it or not because there’s a finite supply of the stuff.
217 2018-10-17 23:37:50 @rayferrarotsn  u cant say McD is much better than matthews?

218 2018-10-17 23:37:47 It is: Oil pulling while I make celery juice followed by skincare followed by vitamins and green tea with apple cider vinegar and lemon followed by bulletproof coffee. Bone broth when I get home from work.

235 2018-10-17 23:35:48 Well, yes. That’s an expected consequence of a transition to a renewable energy economy. Big oil has known about this planned obsolescence for decades and has been given ample opportunity to prepare to transition their business model to renewables.
236 2018-10-17 23:35:45 Brogdon and Henson playing like oil and water
237 2018-10-17 23:35:44 @RepBrianFitz @SenToomey @SenBobCasey @chuckmcilhinney @margueritequinn We need PA to move forward on health protections, not backward. Stop #HB2154 from rolling back critical standards on oil and gas drilling. @LAMPaADVOCACY
238 2018-10-17 23:35:34 I believe that’s hemp based oil
239 2018-10-17 23:35:18 Yeah, before then we were just droning weddings, assassinating 16 yr old Americans, and invading nations for oil but ignoring the UN when they condemned us.
240 2018-10-17 23:35:05 You mean crude oil doesn’t rain down from the sky and magically turn into petrol by itself? 
241 2018-10-17 23:34:54 Not jack shit...
But pray the Iran oil embargo holds. And let the Saudi’s hike oil prices!!!
242 2018-10-17 23:34:52 その時は恐怖で縛って大人しくなるんでしょうが、長い目で見るとろくなもんじゃねえと思います。今の学校の教育システムは、こぼれ落ちる子供を拾えないシステムなんですよねぇ。子供のはみ出した個性に振り回されてるママ友さん達、うちの子の将来どうなるんだろう、って不安を常に抱いてますわー。
243 2018-10-17 23:34:48 The international community should share this burden, if it’s proven SA is behind his death. We shouldn’t have to foot the bill ourselves. Iraq proved the juice isn’t worth the squeeze, as we weren’t bold enough to seize the oil fields as payment for our troubles.
244 2018-10-17 23:34:20 Q: How do you feel about lawsuits against oil/gas
Methvin: Learned in kindergarten you take responsibility. 
"there's no controversy about the damage and how it happened."
-Wouldn't it be better for oil/gas to accept responsibility and step up and settle lawsuits?
245 2018-10-17 23:34:16 We will never run out of oil, due to the last few barrels of oil costing billions of dollars. -u/LTRPhantas

247 2018-10-17 23:33:52 hash oil dabs 
248 2018-10-17 23:33:51 Ask yourself, then why do we care what the Saudi’s do? Remember, if we cut the arms deal, or sanction them, they will turn off the oil spigot? Which will in turn make gas prices $7 a gal. Why? Let them do what they want to the rest of the world, we’ve paid long enough.
249 2018-10-17 23:33:33 because we've emphasised the #oil industry subject. The myth of #Icarus is in the background but I have reached the #sun and didn't burn my #wings . I have flown beyond the sun. It's ok, but it's very lonely up there
250 2018-10-17 23:33:33 It is especially hard when people are brainwashed. For example this whole eco thing that the marine wants is not eco at all. It will not eliminate the destruction of the earth and will expand the cost of gas and oil to produce green bullshit.
251 2018-10-17 23:33:31 Not to mention subsidies already given to oil companies that could go to roads, schools, Healthcare
252 2018-10-17 23:33:27 Wr dont need oil ! We need to stop using oil and get on the electric and public transit trains etc.
253 2018-10-17 23:33:16 Sun doesn't remove glove oil, especially that puddle inside his glove. Have you ever oiled a glove before?
254 2018-10-17 23:33:07 I wish I could eat super healthy like just look at a plate with 3 leaves and a drop of oil and go “ah yes this will suffice.”
255 2018-10-17 23:32:47 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
256 2018-10-17 23:32:43 in the mood to do pretty oil pastel drawings of naked ladies!!!!!
257 2018-10-17 23:32:41 Fink was a regular to the Arab nations sucking up to the oil cages and it looks like a) US is sort of abandoning the Middle East and NATO and b) those with ties to the area may soon hold a big bag of dessert flowers painted black and shredded
258 2018-10-17 23:32:40 i love rosemary & olive oil crackers, and the flatout bread
259 2018-10-17 23:32:39 I gotta get me some of that oil then 
260 2018-10-17 23:32:30 If you don't think so, imagine if we cut spare parts for their military it's an open invite for Iran to invade then we sacrifice lives to help

Imagine Saudi cut off oil supplies to the world. I lived thru the 70's where Saudi cut oil & threw the world economy into a tailspin.

265 2018-10-17 23:31:51 My hair is drenched in coconut oil
266 2018-10-17 23:31:49 I bought a new @Smashbox mattifying primer and I’m going on 5 hours and my face doesn’t have ANY oil. I am in awe.
267 2018-10-17 23:31:35 SUV after SUV... big monster vehicles full of Saudi oil in the most densely populated strip of island forcing cyclists into other cars .. wtf
268 2018-10-17 23:31:34 I was completely shocked. Then she asked if my husband was of Senior age. Clearly she didn’t notice my daily use of Oil of Olay. 
269 2018-10-17 23:31:29 THIS 

And who needs them?  For what?? We should give up oil anyway or we give up our planet. They are brutal to their countrymen and they buy off greedy rich Americans among others.. They bomb civilians in Yemen. They didn't like Iran deal and bought off Trump and Kushner.
270 2018-10-17 23:31:22 Snake oil salesman, imo.
271 2018-10-17 23:31:19 there’s a succulent, an essential oil diffuser and a gold microphone in this uber. I feel so seen??
272 2018-10-17 23:31:10 wow.  you guys are so brainwashed you're going to either think chapter 11 is an amazing new financial innovation from elon musk or that it was some sinister big oil plot...

this will be a fun lesson for you.
273 2018-10-17 23:31:08 If they studied their Bible they would see that it talks of cannabis. Cannabis is part of an oil recipe in the Bible, they spell it Canibussom. The Bible doesn’t say to inhale it but it is good nonetheless.
274 2018-10-17 23:31:04 now the question is will the oil companies rollback the price they did when the TRAIN started???

Second, there aren’t big monetary rewards. There’s grant  money, just like for any valid research. 

Third, there would be bigger money if they could find evidence that disproves AGW. The oil companies would love it

In response to Oil Cartel, would suggest sir you initiate Food Cartel so that fruit and vegetables prices can be doubled it Trippled for exports and increase Farmers Income. In the current world order basic needs are cheap whereas others are costly. Need change
291 2018-10-17 23:29:49 Bwahahaha, deficit is higher than its ever been and going higher. We don't have enough tax revenue to pay our bills. We have a President who lets oil drive his decisions. And the Republicans are now going after the big target...Social Security.
 Great direction we're going in.
292 2018-10-17 23:29:42 Oil is power, remember that.
293 2018-10-17 23:29:35 Oil is more valuable than human life.
294 2018-10-17 23:29:26 What if every oil refinery had a meth lab built in it and have been selling drugs to the world all these decades?
295 2018-10-17 23:29:20 For anyone who has a constipated baby, don't spend $10+ on medicine, a couple of drops from a $2 bottle of olive oil works perfectly
296 2018-10-17 23:29:19 Glove oil goes on the entire glove if done correctly.
297 2018-10-17 23:29:14 World price of oil $80 while Canada's oil is discounted to $20 ... u would think this large discount would be enough to encourage the Fed government to build pipelines to other markets,  just maybe they are not interested even though they bought a 60 year old pipeline for 4.5 B

300 2018-10-17 23:28:52 Also even if we go to green manufacturing, 100% renewable energy, and stop eating meat, China will burn any oil we don't use, release all the chemicals into the rivers and generally do whatever it takes to win technologically and militarily.
301 2018-10-17 23:28:41 what if i told you oil is abundant and they only tell you is scarce so gas prices can go up
302 2018-10-17 23:28:34 Their choice that is soon to be released is one with CBD oil. What kind of “high” will that be?

307 2018-10-17 23:28:17 Stop. You know they say we don’t check for oil changes and brake pads
308 2018-10-17 23:28:04 Oh shut up! The Saudis have oil, and that’s what matters.
309 2018-10-17 23:27:56 You have bigger problems than a $10.00 tax on oil - especially if it goes $120.00 a barrel.
310 2018-10-17 23:27:55 That is a possibility. One of the reasons they cranked up production a few years ago was to inhibit the business drilling being done in the Dakotas, so they are not looking out for our best interests. High oil prices also preceded the 2008 economic collapse.
311 2018-10-17 23:27:55 i will forgive this blasphemy because you have opened my eyes to rosemary-infused olive oil on tomato soup.
312 2018-10-17 23:27:39 How does a journalist rise to the threat level of enemy combatant? I don’t drive much, but I’ll cut down even more to boycott oil. Don’t know when it’s Saudis or others, but I feel we have to get this malevolence out of the deals.
313 2018-10-17 23:27:26 I’ve recently been converted to popcorn popes in a pan on the stove in coconut oil. It’s amazingly good and healthy!
314 2018-10-17 23:27:21 @realDonaldTrump Look at it this way:  the USA is saying it must have SA oil, arms sales, and cooperation against Iran, regardless of what SA does.  The USA is dependent on a medieval kingdom?  Not my definition of "America First" - and I hope, not yours.

318 2018-10-17 23:26:40 You can bet your bottom dollar that it has something to do with oil money and a lot of it!

322 2018-10-17 23:26:34 I am writing a book about this mess. I figure without coal, oil, gas, petrochemicals and oil service Alberta has about 3 million people too many. That's a whack of windmill erectors. Look at Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
323 2018-10-17 23:26:29 Do we still get the same price on oil? Ridiculous!
324 2018-10-17 23:26:29 Decided tonight would be a great night to try @chrissyteigen seared steak w/spicy garlic miso butter. Hubs in his excitement to make the steak in the new cast iron skillet did NOT follow directions&put oil in the pan b4 the steak. Let’s just say the house is STILL full of smoke
325 2018-10-17 23:25:55 The carbon tax is almost universally supported. Oil and gas companies even support it - they don't want to have a massive worldwide collapse of their consumer base either.

327 2018-10-17 23:25:27 Underrated line: "if I break your heart na oil spillage" 
328 2018-10-17 23:25:17 Every time Saudi Arabia does something terrible, we bomb a country populated with brown people that has very little oil and doesn't buy military equipment from us.
329 2018-10-17 23:25:13 & Alberta's minimum wage, if that is indeed where he is from, is $15.00 an hour.  & many places in Alberta were paying higher than minimum wage in order to attract employees who made far more by working in oil industry jobs.
330 2018-10-17 23:25:05 Plain and simple,the economy is not good when everything is going up in price.gas,oil,water bill,cable,cars,food,healthcare,everything!
331 2018-10-17 23:25:02 I took a longgggg shower letting my mask just sit on my face with the steam then rubbed myself down with my coconut butter and special oil
332 2018-10-17 23:24:58 So you're saying this area is off limits, but who gives a damn about the offshore drilling risks elsewhere? Have you seen the economic and environmental damage of spills like BP? Our strength is in the natural gas and renewable market. Work on that instead of oil.
333 2018-10-17 23:24:57 The futures should help stabilize the price if they have strong liquidity. The price of a future should equal the current value of the underlying+the cost of carry(in oil, the cost to hold it in a tanker or warehouse)+ the time value of money for the duration.

And no judge is giving up that sweet gig to compete with liquor stores.

346 2018-10-17 23:23:35 ...as well, mandate sustainable energy production to ELIMINATE the huge need for oil. Take away the incentives ($$$/power/control) & you'll perhaps gain some ground. Leave the Saudi's to their ways. They'll change if their society needs to. The revolt will turn inward.

371 2018-10-17 23:19:56 Well, it’s a start, a very poorly worded one, but a bit of a threat to long term viability of new oil projects, which generally have a notional duration of 30 years

395 2018-10-17 23:17:55 That’s right, if they take people away from Christ like bibles that pour out oil and gold teeth and rubies appearing or gold dust. All that stuff just takes away from Christ but deliverance from demons and healing of the body and blindness cured in Jesus name! This glorifies HIM!
396 2018-10-17 23:17:54 Maybe stop selling them mass amounts of weapons while we're at it. That might be a good place to start. Also stop purchasing Saudi oil. But we know none of that will happen. US gov't is too entrenched in SA. They couldn't even stop after SA financed 9/11. Pathetic leadership.
397 2018-10-17 23:17:32 Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have

398 2018-10-17 23:17:28 Doh! Take the OIL out of the equation & you'd have a chance at change. Until then, big-oil & government interests reign supreme over common sense & decency. The approach is not to blame the Saudi's, gov. or big-oil, but to FORCE laws into effect that end this behaviour.

401 2018-10-17 23:17:08 Project Drawdown is the BEST! It would need feedback. Much like carbon taxes, drawdown gets a foot in the door, hurting oil companies without stopping them. Hopefully, the antics of oil companies would then become so ridiculous that a majority chooses exile for oil companies.

405 2018-10-17 23:16:53 And the IPCC report tells us we only have about ten years to do this so it’s crucial to act now and climate change is the main cause and we have to get off oil. That has to be done now. More work to follow restoring the worlds habitats.

413 2018-10-17 23:16:02 Secretive oil pricing for bp, formerly anglo iranian oil, control over opec, iran under shahs was the spearhead and autonomous in decisionmaking, no industrial competition from iranian intellectual capital but rather all of them working in the west
414 2018-10-17 23:15:51 how do u know u added just the right amount of oil or to much oil to your car??? bc i think i added just a little bit to much

416 2018-10-17 23:15:46 In the euphoria of selling sensational anti-government stories, #JosPondOfDeath doesn't catch their fancy. Still on the first Pond with many more to go, only God knows souls that have been lost there.
417 2018-10-17 23:15:35 Adult things I've done lately:

1.) Graduated school

2.) Got a good job

3.)  Started actually saving

4.) Changed my own oil

5.) Bought shoes that weren't vans

Things I still need to accomplish:

1.) Beat @MattFera1 in Smash
418 2018-10-17 23:15:29 Rather have 350 bucks a barrel for oil?
419 2018-10-17 23:15:19 I’m making tacos and like dbsjsnns I hate oil
420 2018-10-17 23:15:10 I'm so happy I found this cbd body oil life saver fr
421 2018-10-17 23:14:56 Please stop acting as if i didn't understand his statement, he lamented on hausa /fulani and i talked about islam. With the little knowledge i have is that majority of them are Muslims n can be referred to as my earlier statement which shape ur physical structure if well incurred
422 2018-10-17 23:14:50 need a man to do literally anything for you? bribe them with food. I ordered my brother hot wing pizza from Barro's and now he's changing the oil in my car  try it ladies
423 2018-10-17 23:14:49 I love playoff baseball. However, this is the first time in forever I barely watched a game...I’m  not sure what that means really

Maybe coconut oil clouded my brain.
424 2018-10-17 23:14:45 I usually don’t use a spray but if I do it’s Mary Kay sbd I spray it on top of my face after I bake (set) my face w maybelline oil control loose powder. I haven’t found anything that works better
425 2018-10-17 23:14:38 Hmm, nothing to do with sunscreen chemicals, oil spills, sewage, feces and the myriad of other things that have been dumped into the waters with Tsunamis I guess? Just pee. Okay, that's going to be interesting trying to enforce that a catch the culprits. Precarious at best.
426 2018-10-17 23:14:37 The good thing about oil painting is that if you don’t like what you’ve painted, you can just paint over it. A bit more tricky if you’ve gone heavy on texture, but still doable. Saves a fortune in paper.
427 2018-10-17 23:14:20 "The nastiest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
428 2018-10-17 23:14:11 Oil radiators are the best for living warmth since they don’t dry everything out. Electric blankets are the best for sleeping.
429 2018-10-17 23:14:11 2 months. Wasn’t a lick of oil in that bih but I didn’t know anything about cars yet so  but don’t avoid it cause it’s more expensive to fix later
430 2018-10-17 23:14:09 We need to switch fuel sources...we have the technology! But as long as there's more $$$ to be had off of oil, the #PIGs gonna make us ride til the wheels fall off! Or the planet explodes! SMH #PIGSh*t #the_Art_of_Scientific_Denial
431 2018-10-17 23:14:09 mama mo sana oil
432 2018-10-17 23:14:08 Yes ma’am, type oil yuh have?
433 2018-10-17 23:14:02 Que lástima, cuanta pérdida para todos!! Menos trigo, menos flete, menos gas oil, menos cosechadora, menos mano de obra, menos silobolsa, menos ganas, menos para todos... Abrazo!
434 2018-10-17 23:13:36 Iran just made a deal to have Putin (Trump's pal) refine their oil and sell it to bypass any sanctions the U.S. puts on them. Why exactly do you think Iran and Erdogan care if we sanction the Saudis? They would be thrilled. Why don't you people ever know anything?
435 2018-10-17 23:13:34 @yah_zamora Remember when this boy said “nah I think I’m just allergic to an oil/sauce, not the shrimp tho”  awe poor Brian. Time to face reality lol
436 2018-10-17 23:13:32 YouCP would have put us even further back and those numbers would be greater. You might be using Klein’s tired playbook but you don’t have the endless oil revenue to fund the blunders & feed the hungry cronies demanding their share.
437 2018-10-17 23:13:30 Awesome! Good luck!
438 2018-10-17 23:13:29 @realDonaldTrump It really shows the wealth of a man when he puts money etc before. LIFE and I mean all life in general.   "Lowest day"  Murdered and chopped up! But who cares! we need oil and money!  I could not raise my head again after stooping so low...
439 2018-10-17 23:13:28 It only has $ 8.5 million in those 5 companies to divest. Looks more like a PR stunt. Let’s see -Your long oil and gas and want them to cap reserves ?Which would lead to drop in value ? Makes no sense to make those comments and still expect future positive investment return.
440 2018-10-17 23:13:26 They are beyond just cozy. They got way too close to get some of that oil $ and now they own them both. That’s what happens when you are corrupt.
441 2018-10-17 23:13:24 And though she spoke no words,
Everything she said was heard,
As she poured her oil for the master from her box of alabaster,
I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's alabaster box.
Don't be angry, if I wash his feet with my tears  and I dry it  with my hair
442 2018-10-17 23:13:23 They are obviously demanding that the oil companies pump out all the oil from the ground, and do it faster.  Or else they won't invest in those oil companies anymore.
443 2018-10-17 23:13:21 ｻﾞｸｻﾞｸｯいくぞ！
444 2018-10-17 23:13:21 China is building crazy efficient, "envinromentally friendly" coal plants and are, coincidentally one of the world's largest producers of solar panels. For someone who talks "long game" you sure forget that resources like gas and oil are finite.Also solar is top growing industry.
445 2018-10-17 23:13:17 And largest polluter of methane gas. Also gas prices have climbed by $1 since you took office as well as you still haven’t priced the revenue to fix the parks.  Do your job.   Or the oil industry’s work.
446 2018-10-17 23:13:15 Sometimes I wonder if I really LOVE pesto the way I think I love pesto, or if it's just a socially acceptable way to eat things doused in olive oil.
447 2018-10-17 23:13:13 The US has more oil than we need. We are about to become the world's leader in exporting oil. It seems you're the one who has put your nose where it doesn't belong since you don't seem to know what the US is "about".
448 2018-10-17 23:13:07 おはようございますｗｗｗ
449 2018-10-17 23:13:06 Similarly here. It sucks. I'm using an essential oil blend (breath) , it's soothing..
450 2018-10-17 23:13:06 I enjoyed the "due to the high volume..." message haha  And the company I had been ordering from is on there (Hydropothecary) when I had a script.  Only saw oil and sprays from them, but great quality!  I want to try everything haha
451 2018-10-17 23:13:04 THE HOLYSPIRIT IS THE SEAL AND THE OIL THAT YOU NEED IN YOUR LAMB IF YOU WANT TO RISE AND BE JOINED WITH JESUS IN THE AIR!
452 2018-10-17 23:12:55 I just found a gram of oil that we lost like a month ago and I couldn’t be happier
453 2018-10-17 23:12:55 He lied at the debate about his own record. Cruz said O'Rourke voted yes to add a tax  $10/barrel of oil produced in TX. he denied, fact checkers say Cruz is right. Beto is a fraud & liar.
454 2018-10-17 23:12:47 Why? Trump even said if USA stopped providing them a military they would collapse quickly. We also apparently don’t need them propping up petrodollar as much since USA is producing alot more oil. Perhaps this would push Trump 2 stop fighting countries thataren’t brutal monarchies
455 2018-10-17 23:12:44 Now that crude oil price has reached $80 per barrel, there is justification and no more reason not to suspend or postpone. This is the only remaining safeguard and it is now applicable.
456 2018-10-17 23:12:43 See, then you have oil.
457 2018-10-17 23:12:15 This is complete nonsense. We can control Iran with two flyovers and a monkey kicking a couple bombs out the side door. We don't need Saudi Arabia either. But we like big oil, big SUVs and big politics.
458 2018-10-17 23:12:06 on the w train and someone just cracked open a whole bottle of eucalyptus oil in this bih
459 2018-10-17 23:12:03 My hair is growing thanks to rice water and coconut oil & no heat
460 2018-10-17 23:11:59 Ditto on the chin breakout, 1 year younger. Also my skin’s version of “hydrated” is “oil slick.”
461 2018-10-17 23:11:51 Another 27.50 or so that jacked that up those you mentioned courtesy of oil producing countries
462 2018-10-17 23:11:29 What Rooms Smell Like an Oil Lantern
463 2018-10-17 23:11:21 In recruitment, I learned an employer can ask about health issues under strict conditions. i.e. fitness to operate heavy machinery & a woman going for a job on an oil rig takes a pregnancy test. But, if they’re asking for these reasons, HR are misguided on these exemptions.
464 2018-10-17 23:11:20 @TeslaCharts you know the SEC is being ruled by big oil and the big three, when Elizabeth Hommes, chstgec with massive Fraud, was only fined $500. While Musk was fined $20 million.
465 2018-10-17 23:11:16 Chimpanzee, Plant Matter, Oil Rig, Falcon, Grape, Trombone
466 2018-10-17 23:11:16 thieves essential oil on the bottoms of your feet and in a diffuser...breathe deeply!  feel better! #yleo
467 2018-10-17 23:11:11 I never tried this stuff - loads of on line comments about how the hemp oil helps worth pain.  I will wait a bit.
468 2018-10-17 23:11:08 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "Jauge huile cassée (varilla de aceite rota) (gauge has broken oil)" à l'adresse
469 2018-10-17 23:11:05 In reality, that deal has not been sealed and the amounts are not as much as trump is saying.

trump says they are allies - but, the majority of 9/11 terrorists were Saudis.  SA IS The birthplace for ME terrorism.

We do not have to buy their oil.
470 2018-10-17 23:11:04 I don't drive a car but gas prices make food prices go up. Plus we get to choose between bthe Saudis and Iranians and Turks. All scum. Do you suggest we drill for oil here Cenk or in the Arctic? Admit you just want an international incident to make Trump look bad.
471 2018-10-17 23:11:00 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Jauge huile cassée (varilla de aceite rota) (gauge has broken oil)
472 2018-10-17 23:11:00 What's the issue with our currency and oil?  You are the ones who want into our market, not vice versa.  

WTF are you even on about?  LOL!
473 2018-10-17 23:10:56 Ok, first mistake, it's not coal, it's oil, but that's not really gonna play a role here, so I'll start next tweet
474 2018-10-17 23:10:56 As a humanist and an atheist I have no truck with the UK and USA supporting SA because the relationship has always been about money, oil and arms for world domination by psychopaths that don't even realise they will have nothing in the end.
475 2018-10-17 23:10:50 Hey Jay I am paying a double tax on Social Security now and doubtful I will see this in my lifetime back. Giving handouts to many has taken a toll on programs that were never re-financed years ago. In our own state the property taxes, grocery taxes, potential oil taxes are enough
476 2018-10-17 23:10:46 what essential oil do i use to increase my cash flow
477 2018-10-17 23:10:36 This is just his way of dancing around the fact that his denial of climate change is based on his financial benefit, and not on scientific facts. He just has an "instinct" that the coal and oil industries want their returns for supporting his campaign
478 2018-10-17 23:10:23 We keep finding more oil
479 2018-10-17 23:10:17 The amount of time I spent looking for olive oil in grocery store is concerning... why isn't it with the dressings? Why is it with the spices?! Ugh.
480 2018-10-17 23:10:16 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
481 2018-10-17 23:10:15 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
482 2018-10-17 23:10:11 I need a oil change tomorrow
483 2018-10-17 23:10:10 how much vitamin C  ?  I take about 12000 to 15000 units a day. plus take zinc and D3 and A, oregano oil.
484 2018-10-17 23:10:05 Bought a couch, drove a u-haul, moved into a new apartment, transferred bills into my name, and got an oil change in 24 hours #adulting
485 2018-10-17 23:09:34 I'm a little suspicious about this Saudia  Mystery.
Ever notice this stuff happens around voting time? 
Dems would love to see us fight with the Saudis,the oil would go up and the gas prices would do the same . It would be "blame"Trump.
486 2018-10-17 23:09:29 Ohhh really? /evil smirk/ jjinja baby oil? You two looks good tho
487 2018-10-17 23:09:24 She’s awful!  I loved “Oil Spill”
488 2018-10-17 23:09:14 It seems that we are supposed to be trying to reduce oil use. Not working too well. 
489 2018-10-17 23:09:02 The value of your currency dolt? The issues with oil? The problem with you having to lose all that cash for your dairy products that we are not going to purchase? And that's just putting it into terms ever YOU would be able to understand.
490 2018-10-17 23:08:55 So Pat Robertson repealed one of the TEN COMMANDMENTS to rape more oil from the ground?  Seize by greed is he.  Our God condems the wicked, including Pat Robertson
491 2018-10-17 23:08:51 Should I be upset that my cooking oil has vanished from my house and no one will admit to it?
492 2018-10-17 23:08:49 Suppose those additional tankers will run silent as opposed to the tankers carrying Alberta oil?  What is the difference?  Unbelievable.
493 2018-10-17 23:08:38 That’s great for you, but... you realize that the vast majority of us aren’t in the oil industry, right?
494 2018-10-17 23:08:27 i hit my brother with a bottle of cooking oil ._.
495 2018-10-17 23:08:24 Omg I have the Moroccan argon oil and it’s literally amazing & smells so good 
496 2018-10-17 23:08:09 They can work that out for themselves...I’d rather get our oil from Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
497 2018-10-17 23:08:06 are we talking about the radiated monsters the size of an oil rig? If only lol...
498 2018-10-17 23:08:02 I move in with my sister & the first thing she says is “no oil on my driveway” 
499 2018-10-17 23:07:57 The SF Pension fund cracks me up, talk about dumb money. So if the oil companies pledge to stop being oil companies, thus destroying themselves, the pension fund will keep their shares!!!
500 2018-10-17 23:07:54 Postmate peppermint oil and put it on your temples and the base of your skull.  It always gets rid of my migraines..  Feel better!
501 2018-10-17 23:07:53 A little bit of oil helps too! 
502 2018-10-17 23:07:51 Wonder when (if!) US comes to terms with KSA being its biggest threat. 73 Oil Crisis, 9/11, Trump.
503 2018-10-17 23:07:51 My SO's mom makes this SUPER amazing hydrating lotion cuz she's a Gardener and a mother of 7 and a cooking queen. It's basically an oil bar with lots of nice things! She holds it so it melts a little and then rubs it around her hands till it all soaks in. Want the recipe?
504 2018-10-17 23:07:50 i love coconut oil .
505 2018-10-17 23:07:40 That was just a caution, it's important to separate tribe from religion (his tweet was about hausa/fulani not Muslims... As he said, it's genetics...
506 2018-10-17 23:07:38 the moroccan argon oil one or the honey one is tHE SHIT
507 2018-10-17 23:07:35 Any type of cooking oil can be lightly brushed on too, I imagine.
508 2018-10-17 23:07:32 Changing oil/filter sooner than service requirement is just throwing money away. I change mine every 12,000 km and that's based on oils from 1990 - oils have improved a lot since then. No 4T oil was on the market when the the ST1100 was first on the market.
509 2018-10-17 23:07:29 Yep! Essential Oil Necklace, Tall boots, Fuzzy Sherpa Hoodie, Carhartt Leggings all on the wayyy. Needing a black rock dinner soon & a cedar point trip 
510 2018-10-17 23:07:27 This journalist who ever he was....he is not worth risking higher oil prices over....HELL NO
511 2018-10-17 23:07:27 I use CBD oil now and await that and edibles... the whole smoking thing doesn’t work for me at all..

515 2018-10-17 23:06:50 That place never gets old.
516 2018-10-17 23:06:44 What’s even more stunning is if the oil company pledges to stop being an oil company they will their shares!! #DumbMoney
517 2018-10-17 23:06:38 Your good at what you do “cover the oil & gas hydrocarbon  chain.
I suggest you stick with it and don’t go deep into something you have no clue in which is politics.
Saudi is doing what is in their best interest & if they don’t want to close deals with xyz then they should doit

520 2018-10-17 23:06:23 need a gravity blanket and CBD oil rn rn rn
521 2018-10-17 23:06:19 Perhaps the West prefers it being a mess. That was Chomsky's theory. Plus Saudi oil is significant for allies.
522 2018-10-17 23:06:12 Had hot tea with honey and lemon this morning. I forgot about the Airborne fizzies !!! I have some. I'm out of eucalyptus oil tho. Thank you so much sweetie 
523 2018-10-17 23:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
524 2018-10-17 23:06:06 @PASenateGOP @PaSenateDems  vote NO on #HB2154 We need PA to move forward on health protections, not backward. Stop #HB2154 from rolling back critical standards on oil and gas drilling.  @ELCAadvocacy

528 2018-10-17 23:05:46 If your not super sick Try a quick workout or run followed by a shower then some calming lavender or eycaliptas body oil. If ur not well enough for that a nice bubble bath with lavender
529 2018-10-17 23:05:45 I have a proper 12 for you.
530 2018-10-17 23:05:40 Congress only punishes countries to destroy their currency and steal their oil under the manipulation of standing for democracy.
531 2018-10-17 23:05:37 You want to live out in the sticks and have to rely on oil heating if you want stupid prices. Just paid over £500 for 750 litres of kerosene...
532 2018-10-17 23:05:11 if oil stains the paper you can't save it anymore in any case so stop this crime against humanity
533 2018-10-17 23:05:08 今日は何かやる気ないし休もうかと思ったけどよく考えたら毎日やる気なかった
534 2018-10-17 23:04:59 Cant get along with this "oil and water" culture.
535 2018-10-17 23:04:58 What an incredible #oandcinktober it’s been. Join us for the second half! #inktober2018  @ Oil and Cotton
536 2018-10-17 23:04:53 Oil is much more important
537 2018-10-17 23:04:47 Almost all these own no Oil Sands facilities at all. Only Husky and MEG.
538 2018-10-17 23:04:47 Just aired up the tires on the Yukon. Brings me back to my oil changing days  I am glad that Taylor takes care of this stuff now though 
539 2018-10-17 23:04:46 He revealed himself as a snake oil salesman long ago.
540 2018-10-17 23:04:37 Where do you get your black soap from?? And what kind of vitamin e oil?
541 2018-10-17 23:04:30 yeah the oil starts raining on the box from the bottom
542 2018-10-17 23:04:30 Great choice! The perfect oil for the seasons ahead of us!
543 2018-10-17 23:04:26 Apple cider vinegar (2tbs) mixed with lemon water. Eat a few roasted garlic cloves and pop a few oil of oregano capsules.... Watch your breathe...
544 2018-10-17 23:04:24 You need some fish oil
545 2018-10-17 23:04:11 Agree, that’s like forcing oil to mix with water  
True Raider fans turning into Charger fans?  yeah, good luck with that..

548 2018-10-17 23:03:59 19 of 20 of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, so we bombed iraq.

I'm not sure what hold prince bin Salman has over us that makes us turn a blind eye to all of their brutality, repression, and spreading of the extremist sect of Islam.

Oh. Oil and money. Of course.
549 2018-10-17 23:03:59 If I was a female this would be my week to shine.... I’d be poppin that pussy all over the oil show 
550 2018-10-17 23:03:55 But it is the same in the UK and support of Saudi, oil will be a part of it but I'm pretty sure there's a lot more!
551 2018-10-17 23:03:40 Liberals got all shitty when Trump renegotiated the Canadian trade deal.  Now they want to cut ties with the one country that we actually need.  And since libs shitvon fracking, we are not self reliant with oil.  Less that 20% of our energy is renewable so environmentalist stfu.
552 2018-10-17 23:03:28 Used to be day after Thanksgiving.  Then family voted 3-1 to handle it on Thanksgiving Day.  I was the one, so while they decorate, I drink a lot and maneuver about fowl and scalding got oil.
553 2018-10-17 23:03:25 Oil of oregano capsules! I swear by them!
554 2018-10-17 23:03:23 Funding is tightening & #oil is rising. Worthy to take a look at the number of airline insolvencies around the world, that may threaten soveriegn budgets!
555 2018-10-17 23:03:22 Jamaican Black Castor Oil is the King of oils
556 2018-10-17 23:03:18 Day 3 of being sick. Tea, vitamin c, chicken soup, and oregano oil have failed me. Breathing from my nose again would be dope.
557 2018-10-17 23:03:17 sophies oil of every pearl's un-insides vinyl is coming out on december 7th according to amazon you can pre-order it hopefully it includes the remix albums part of its physical release but all the songs we've been waiting for are coming, what a cute xmas present
558 2018-10-17 23:03:11 Saudi’s have the oil. Saudi pilots carried out the 9/11 attack murdering scores of citizens, first responders, and military personnel at the Pentagon. Now a permanent resident of the United States was brutally tortured and slaughtered. The Saudi’s murder their own. Barbaric.
559 2018-10-17 23:02:51 Hello @realDonaldTrump,
In 1990 I and many others were sent to @saudiarabia to protect it’s oil and royal family.
Eleven years later they sent 15 of their citizens to kill almost 3,000 people and terrorize our nation.
They sent 15 to kill and dismember Khashoggi.
Do something!
560 2018-10-17 23:02:44 And a lot of money and oil but that beside the point
561 2018-10-17 23:02:24 Murdoch is on the board of Genie Energy, which found oil in Golan Heights in Syria. Him & Dick Cheney along with others have invested millions. Trump moved the Embassy to Jerusalem to make it easier to move boards & take the oil.
Murdoch helps, Trump helps Murdoch.
562 2018-10-17 23:02:22 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
563 2018-10-17 23:02:20 The world needs to be asking itself, right now, if it can live without Saudi oil.  The kingdom offers us little else of value.
564 2018-10-17 23:02:06 Kershaw glove needs oil
565 2018-10-17 23:02:03 Reduce oil and gas RESERVES???
566 2018-10-17 23:01:57 Echinacea and Thieves Essential Oil from Young @younglivingeo
567 2018-10-17 23:01:55 Pretty much . Which in a way is worse, because only political wonks would properly understand why Ted Cruz was so fucking evil. It’s why GWB gets to do oil paintings despite committing a thousand war crimes
568 2018-10-17 23:01:55 Yup. Too bad . They are competing with oil shipments on which the railways make more money.  Never know ;maybe some pipelines will get built. But it will get worse in the short term for the farmers ,as the oil by rail shipments ramp up from 200,000 to 400,000 barrels per day.
569 2018-10-17 23:01:38 CBD oil in NYC >
570 2018-10-17 23:01:36 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Amen
571 2018-10-17 23:01:33 They were selling cbd oil and capsules at medicine hat.
572 2018-10-17 23:01:31 Catch up brother, didn't say the site was in Maiduguri. Staff of UniMaid recruited for this purpose were waylaid & murdered along with their security escort in the course of this oil exploration.
573 2018-10-17 23:01:26 so uh lil tattoo update before i rlly go to bed:
had a crisis. It wasn’t healing like it was supposed to but i think ?? i’ve got it sorted now. It’s not hurting as much as it was and i’ve drowned it in coconut oil in hopes it gets better, it’s still pretty red and i can’t do -
574 2018-10-17 23:01:04 Almost cried when I saw kenneth and tre in OIL AND WATER CHOREO
575 2018-10-17 23:01:03 Love thy oil supplier as thyself.
576 2018-10-17 23:00:54 2-imperialist ambitions of those 3 countries: the US Isarël & KSA that are trying to impose their domination to the region & expand their own influence, interests (OIL) & borders when it comes to Israël 
A war against Iran could draw in Russia & possibly China Pakistan & India
577 2018-10-17 23:00:38 Denmark sells oil as fast as it can to the "capitalists" to fund the Danish socialist machine. Socialism is nearly always parasitic on capitalism. In the area of medical and pharma research as well. Sad but true.
578 2018-10-17 23:00:38 There are fans who need stats to watch a #Canucks game and there are fans who just watch the game and eyeball the quality. Both sides are oil to water— don’t mix the 2 fans up 
579 2018-10-17 23:00:31 Tell me the majority pls, about 4 times daily prayers is a mistake.... And your not above that tooo Oga 'sa ido'
580 2018-10-17 23:00:30 #WhyWeShouldLegalizeIt farmers could actually make a profit, poor ppl in pain could affordably control their pain w/o pills, children could stop seizures w/ the oil, hemp could replace many imported goods, criminality taken away would set ppl free in prison.

582 2018-10-17 23:00:27 I hope he comes up.with something besides magical thinking and doubling down on oil..that's what got us in trouble...every bust.
583 2018-10-17 23:00:23 They want these oil companies to pledge to leave their current reserves in the ground. These morons are supposed to be fiduciaries of other people’s capital
584 2018-10-17 23:00:22 O Cannabis, our home & native plant
True vapor love & no one says we can't
With glowing hearts we see thee rise, the true bud strong & sweet 
with flowers & oil, O cannabis, we'll smoke it in the street
God keep our plant, glorious & green
O cannabis we'll stand in line for thee
585 2018-10-17 23:00:18 #Hypocrisy Oil Money corrupts everyone.  Isn't it obvious that @realDonaldTrump  and his #Republicans are selling out #Americans?  Worse, they are lying about #science re #climatechange to enrich themselves at expense of #humankind
586 2018-10-17 23:00:10 Awright baby oil! Will do it 
587 2018-10-17 23:00:08 For denny , if we take our oil, can you live without a.c !!!!
588 2018-10-17 23:00:00 I dunno maybe because Nigerians aren’t many in the Fitfam thing but shopping tip for Fitfam food, always check the clearance area. There’s always something that’s Fitfam that’s in clearance. I’m talking avocado/olive oil, almond butter, healthy snacks at like 70% off
589 2018-10-17 22:59:50 More LIES! His natural instinct is to the money he pockets when fracking & drilling for oil happens, he gets his CUT! Other than that, he doesn't know much!  GO, FOLKS, LET'S GET OUR REGULATIONS BACK THAT PROTECT OUR AIR, WATER & PLANET! RIDE THE BLUE WAVE! 
590 2018-10-17 22:59:46 ないちゃう
591 2018-10-17 22:59:32 Online oil parties happening this weekend! Super laid back. Lots of info and a free giveaway!! Anyone want to join these ladies parties?? My friends or theirs are welcome to attend!
592 2018-10-17 22:59:14 Not sure what one of my children drank baby oil, but one of them definitely fucking did 
593 2018-10-17 22:59:13 Trump is a snake oil salesman John so you/we should expect nothing less from him
594 2018-10-17 22:59:13  Nationalized the oil industry.
 Opposed the invasion of Iraq.
 Hates the Muslim Brotherhood.

I mean, people on here have done more with less...
595 2018-10-17 22:59:13 Why even bother saying it ! He’s a joke to anyone with a brain. However many are naive sadly and buy his snake oil
596 2018-10-17 22:59:12 sana oil 
597 2018-10-17 22:59:05 UUUH LIKE i always get double mozzarella so sometimes part of it just goes over pizza boundaries and the box becomes a mess of oil and mozzarella, same with some other toppings...
598 2018-10-17 22:58:58 Two diff't games, both based on dark power ($): 

1) DT, to be bigger than Dad, cozies up to Big $ (Rus mob '84-now; SAr, UAE oil $)

2) GOP and neo-Birchites (Kochs, Scaife, Mercers) off-stage x yrs, use dark $ to shrink Govt/taxes 

After DT nom, parallel greed at publ expense.
599 2018-10-17 22:58:51 If a company reduces its oil and gas reserves, I presume they do this by selling it to another oil company...How does SFERS think this is going to do anything meaningful for their mission?
600 2018-10-17 22:58:50 Also, gonna be a lot more tender w/ thighs but a lot less healthy. Either way u wanna make sure u cut the chicken pretty thin so it cooks quick an even when u fry it in the pan. (I also think the recipe called for too much oil but u do gotta add oil in continuously - like 1/4in)
601 2018-10-17 22:58:43 A realistic optimist?  Gee thanks, I just blew my milk out my nose when I read that.  You my dear are a fear mongering, sky is falling, snake oil saleswoman, and if you actually believe the crap you are peddling, I trully feel sorry for you.
602 2018-10-17 22:58:43 oil, good and silver would be nice
603 2018-10-17 22:58:41 Need for what? Isnt't it too many women already in executive positions? I haven't had some male boss since i was 23, now i'm 31 and I've changedat least 4 companies fore more than 6 months. Moscow, FA Logistician, oil and gas field.
604 2018-10-17 22:58:36 
O feditse baby oil maybe 
605 2018-10-17 22:58:33 Why are we still dependent on their oil, 9/11 perps all came from there.
606 2018-10-17 22:58:19 Now Krystal oil change I understand. Changing your tire isn’t that bad just takes a min. but you mean to tell me you don’t know how to wash your car?!
607 2018-10-17 22:58:06 9 to 10 pesos minimum fare. s/o to trump ipitin pa natin ang mga bansang nag susupply ng oil and petroleum products. Masaya to!
608 2018-10-17 22:58:03 sOrry the only thing I'm allowed to wear is coconut and castor oil  if my skin is damaged you can blame my dad

I know I could do better
IM UPSET
612 2018-10-17 22:57:36 Why did Trump beg them to step up oil output to 2m barrels then?
613 2018-10-17 22:57:29 Just need CBD and THC oil, both are legal!
614 2018-10-17 22:57:17 RT Yeson1631 It's almost they can't find anyone who's against #yeson1631 that isn't paid by oil companies....
615 2018-10-17 22:57:11 Been meaning to try CBD oil for my depression and insomnia.
616 2018-10-17 22:57:07 Lol still not gona do anything to them. Maybe once they run out of oil 
617 2018-10-17 22:57:04 You have Beto pegged incorrectly. He is for THE PEOPLE and not for big oil/gas, corporations, or the richest. He is epitome of what our country and Texas needs
618 2018-10-17 22:56:56 @0820Kiaiirero 
おはようございます
FDA TAKE OFF Qヒット
おめでとうございます
619 2018-10-17 22:56:30 Needs an oil change and front TPMS need to be fixed but too much else is going on lmfao
620 2018-10-17 22:56:18 I haven't seen enough of Valamki, but the thing is Calgary organization said they had Bennett ranked higher than Draisaitl that year. With Yamamoto he was taken 6 spots below Valimaki. Oil prob wouldn't have taken him at 22.
621 2018-10-17 22:56:18 We don't need them for oil..AT ALL! We're practically sitting on the stuff right now! 
622 2018-10-17 22:56:14 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
623 2018-10-17 22:56:12 I agree. Get rid of subsidies for big oil, tax deductions for yachts and private planes, raise tax on capital gains over $500,000.

For starters.
624 2018-10-17 22:56:12 Add seasame oil 
625 2018-10-17 22:56:05 Hot tea, honey, lemon.  Airborne fizzy tablets or gummies.  Eucalyptus oil in a diffuser.  Bed rest as much as possible.

Love and Light and Healing Vibes, hon.  Feel better!
626 2018-10-17 22:56:04 not to mention that we are the indirect cause of a lot of environmental destruction in poorer countries through deforestation for agriculture, e-waste dumping, oil exploration, mining, etc. 
climate change is a global issue. if we want to solve this problem, then we need to...
627 2018-10-17 22:56:04 @edinhelp Stevenlaw's Close EH1 1QT. cooking oil on public Close Surface VERY SLIPPY PEOPLE ARE FALLING. Oil coming from binyard used by Civerino pizza and Spatchcock in Hunter Square. Second similar incident in last few months.
628 2018-10-17 22:56:04 I live in Midland Tx. They set up the infrastructure here back before smoking cigarettes were bad for you. Any rain in this town ruins 100s of cars due to flooding. Our city pays the highest taxes in Texas as well, but no issues get fixed. But OIL is up so who cares?! 
629 2018-10-17 22:56:00 I could always tell when a boom was on around my grandparents in Sedan. All the oil company buildings got new paint and names
630 2018-10-17 22:55:55 Come on, Saudis can do whatever they want, Western powers want to keep that oil flowing and use them as the ruling country in that region. Americans aren’t going to think critically enough to reach that conclusion, plus they are too busy watching sports & BS
631 2018-10-17 22:55:54 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
632 2018-10-17 22:55:49 i bought a cbd pen because i want to have a little more control over my anxiety and get better sleep and omg i’m so excited for it to get here!! i can’t wait to try it! i’ve tried the oil before and it works well but tastes so gross
633 2018-10-17 22:55:48 Peppermint oil on your temples if possible ⚘
634 2018-10-17 22:55:43 Are you clueless to the 1000’s of ppl using cbd oil Instead of hardcore pain pills?
635 2018-10-17 22:55:39 I’m so glad I know how to change a tire out and do oil changes !
636 2018-10-17 22:55:39 ただ全然揃わない、ステッカーラビさんしか来てない
637 2018-10-17 22:55:29 Beto doesn't want to raise the taxes of average Texans.  He wants to raise the taxes of the oil company executives that own Cruz.
638 2018-10-17 22:55:17 PSA: Fellas, this has to be shared. If you’re in a relationship, and you truly  care about her, it’s your responsibility if her oil change light comes on, or the car needs to be washed. Especially, if you’re using her car.
639 2018-10-17 22:55:08 Exactly. Imagine if another nation who hated us made this happen. This caused the entire MSM to bash Trump/America. This caused even long time pol supporters of SA to scream foul. Oil markets on edge. It's the perfect vehicle for chaos.
640 2018-10-17 22:55:02 Positive? Like continuing off of Misha's statement about oil rig fanfic? I'm very confused.
641 2018-10-17 22:54:51 BS WE ARE NOT ENERGY INDEPENDENT!  We import 40% of our oil AND we are one of the top oil producers in the world.
642 2018-10-17 22:54:49 Ha! So na only politicians and oil well owners dem dey follow?
643 2018-10-17 22:54:49 Tea Tree oil boil it breath in the steam
644 2018-10-17 22:54:47 Scott ,Aside from loaning money to certain criminals what exactly does Saudi Arabia do for the US? Oil? Nope...agriculture? Nope
Apart from cornering the world supply of houseflies, they actually are a minor world player, they extort Muslims for the privilege of visiting Mecca.
645 2018-10-17 22:54:37 Oil & gas companies complaining about current 'chronic gas shortages' from pipe issues say the answer is more gas. Gas dependency is the problem and more if it isn't the solution
646 2018-10-17 22:54:30 Chuck my dude, the Yemen stuff began under Obama.  This country doesn't have an ally in the Saudis & I don't understand why we support such a murderous, repressive regime other than oil.
647 2018-10-17 22:54:24 Lol no doobies, oil and giant vapouriser. Doobies are too smelly, got kids and shit lol
648 2018-10-17 22:54:23 Well, that’s convenient for them. Facts and this administration are like oil and water.
649 2018-10-17 22:54:13 Surely you must have seen that oil change shop on Chicago Dr. which last year was offering pumpkin spice oil changes
650 2018-10-17 22:54:02 Cover you in baby oil for starters x
651 2018-10-17 22:54:00 This product is hydrogenated oil and was introduced for poor people that could not afford pure ghee. Its basically oil that looks like ghee. I know coz I worked closely with the manufacturers.
652 2018-10-17 22:53:50 I dropped 3 cups in a week I should for Houston Oil Spillers
653 2018-10-17 22:53:47 Ethereum oil definitely not holding up well with the push towards renewable sources of energy
654 2018-10-17 22:53:40 Melted cheese oil is my favorite dry lip moisturizer.
655 2018-10-17 22:53:39 Who tryna drink a shoe full of vegetable oil behind a chase bank with my uncle Don?
656 2018-10-17 22:53:37 I’m not big on homeopathic remedies but if you have an essential oil diffuser, mix lemon, eucalyptus, & lavender. I have horrible sinus problems & that helps. It’s not a miracle cure but it helps a lot. Also Mucinex and Alka Seltzer Cold Plus
657 2018-10-17 22:53:32 You can buy oil from your (according to Trumps) ‘former’ Ally Canada.
658 2018-10-17 22:53:13 Y’all i just called my dad to see where he was he said “my gf is giving me a ride home from an oil show party, im drunk. Her name is heather and she’s the love of my life” heather is my step mom lmao 
659 2018-10-17 22:52:57 What essencial oil helps with fear never getting your life together?
660 2018-10-17 22:52:51 That's the key to the entire thing. If they've found a way to play NFL games there, without impacting the football, then what is the problem, you know? It seems like something that can only be good for the club.  We have to compete and it's not blood-soaked oil/slavery money.
661 2018-10-17 22:52:39 if king supports goldy then hes as vile as she is. She incites violence, hangs out with the proud boys. its bad enough that she gets American money and gets american press, the same people that took america down are trying to take canada down. postmedia, koch, king & oil go home.
662 2018-10-17 22:52:31 touch me and niggas sliding like they running on oil
663 2018-10-17 22:52:30 めちゃくちゃ箱推しなんです
664 2018-10-17 22:52:27 I'd love to see the cost of oil skyrocket. I support carbon taxes and renewable energy. Nice try, though! As the Western World moves to green energy, your sad kingdom loses the only commodity it has. Enjoy your collapse.
665 2018-10-17 22:52:23 I see how it may align with an opinion or a worldview, but the facts do not bear out your opinion. Maybe the oil industry suffered — but it was obviously more than balanced out by growth in other industries.
666 2018-10-17 22:52:14 可愛いすぎかてか一緒にやろ！笑
667 2018-10-17 22:52:01 ……
668 2018-10-17 22:51:59 Add 3-4 tbsp of cocoa powder, a tbsp or so of sugar, and a tbsp of milk or oil. Taste for chocolate quality, then bake as usual, plus maybe an extra 5 minutes. 
669 2018-10-17 22:51:59 Y’all...I was oil pulling this morning and desperately had to sneeze. I tried to hold it in but couldn’t and I spit coconut oil/spit all over myself 
670 2018-10-17 22:51:44 If I can oil and massage yours
671 2018-10-17 22:51:33 なんか定価見つからなさそうだし、ステッカーグループ揃えたいけどArS輝しかでてないしきつそう
672 2018-10-17 22:51:32 If we want true energy independence  we need to stop buying oil from Saudi.
673 2018-10-17 22:51:28 ... oil it oil it up ... press dat gas when yuh wining ... 
674 2018-10-17 22:51:21 @PnPCBC Your professor guest from CIGI just said Saudi Arabia produces 25% of world oil supply. 

Saudi Arabia produces 10% of world oil supply and is a significantly less important supplier in the world.

Quite a miss.

681 2018-10-17 22:50:40 Isaiah 61:3 To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified."
682 2018-10-17 22:50:29 I reckon I could drink sesame oil.
683 2018-10-17 22:50:22 Its called:
1. Keeping Trumps Hotel's afloat.
2. #2 Oil exporter to U.S.
3. 110 Billion dollar Arms Deal.
4. Illegal Unmentionables.
684 2018-10-17 22:50:13 Is it just me that feels like he's trying to heat the oil with the charger head. Except the key is in the way though, but that's also conductive. 
Cos I don't see any other reason to balance palm oil on a charger 
685 2018-10-17 22:50:06 Yes they're right up there with any number Jihadi terrorist organisations. Difference is though, eventually Trump the Brits etc will quietly crawl back to MBS as oil & money speak louder than the Butchers table...
686 2018-10-17 22:50:00 It's okay   I'm hopeful that my cbd oil kicks it
687 2018-10-17 22:49:59 Cruz reliance on oil money assures Texans of a polluted coast line, roads collapsing from water and oil trucks due to fracking, polluted air, future mass shootings due to lack of background checks. Great legacy to our children and grandchildren.
688 2018-10-17 22:49:56 Under the laws in place now, once they get here nothing can be done but let them in. 
Its insanity.
Overwhelming the system to collapse is the goal. Our legal system cant possibly deal with them all.
689 2018-10-17 22:49:46 Dude I have forgotten to get olive oil the last 4 times I got groceries.... Grrrr
690 2018-10-17 22:49:42 *phone calls to mom*
"hey, what's that one thing I like that you make and how do I make it?"
"Hey mom, does boxed wine go bad?"
"mom, are oil changes supposed to be this expensive"
"Mama why did you let me get old enough to live on my own"
691 2018-10-17 22:49:23 Hmmm. I just read a report saying there has not been a vote on an oil tax since before Beto was in office. 

Facts are usually stubborn for you Senator. Can some one confirm/comtest this so I’m not just using my own sources?
692 2018-10-17 22:49:16 Everyone whines about oil tankers, which are heavily monitored, but really the ships you just mentioned and 6000 other large industrial and recreational ships go in and out of the Vancouver waters each year.  What do they spew from their bilges and holds?

697 2018-10-17 22:48:39 Finally. I am finally going to be able to treat my PTSD symptoms with CBD oil. I just ordered some from the government website.
698 2018-10-17 22:48:34 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
699 2018-10-17 22:48:32 You “supply”? College educated women know that condoms, oil, tires are supplied. Not financial & economic health.
700 2018-10-17 22:48:27 Driving my grandmas car getting her oil changed and car washed I went from looking like a bad bitch to a soccer mom real quick.
701 2018-10-17 22:48:25 theyre just gonna give you drugs that do what weed does for you but with weird ass side effects. also try fish oil
702 2018-10-17 22:48:24 Yes, of course, if oil companies didn’t obstruct and lie about the problem.
703 2018-10-17 22:48:20 Oil koulèv ??

705 2018-10-17 22:48:10 Onto my third Rice Krispies treat while getting my oil changed.
706 2018-10-17 22:47:59 @sciencevs I just saw a commercial claiming that corn oil was healthier than other oils. I’d love to listen to an episode about that- what common cooking products (other than milk, obvs B/c milk episode!) like butter replacements, oils, etc are actually better for you.
707 2018-10-17 22:47:51 The GOP works for the fossil fuel companies. All the GOP are owned by oil gas coal. Owned by them. When we can't live on this planet where are the greedy rich White people going to go where are their spoiled rotten rich brats going to live.
708 2018-10-17 22:47:47 Saudi Oil is blood oil!
709 2018-10-17 22:47:39 Back to the field of oil tomorrow lol
710 2018-10-17 22:47:25 People hate doin Math but got no problem calculating how many Nutter Butters Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos can buy with all their money in order to fill the sun with enough fuel to have endless amounts of peanut oil and save the Polar Ice Caps
711 2018-10-17 22:47:21 May is not interested in the Uk, she wants to stop the EU from failing, Blair made his billion after PM from oil after his war, Brown made his millions after bailing out the banks at tax payers expense. May wants to make her millions by betraying the British selling out to the EU
712 2018-10-17 22:47:13 Aloe vera gel is better than fennel oil in treating diabetic ulcersCompound found in brown algae and sea cucumber found to inhibit formation of skin cancer and promote cancer cell death
713 2018-10-17 22:47:02 Reliance Industries Halts Ant Oil Imports
714 2018-10-17 22:46:57 Norway’s got massive oil revenues and Switzerland has banks.
What’s garage boy trying to say?
715 2018-10-17 22:46:49 We as a country woud have little need for countries like Saudi Arabia and their oil, if Americans would just use common sense and purchase a reasonable vehicle that could transport their families from point A to point B and get good fuel mileage. The choice is yours.
716 2018-10-17 22:46:29 Boy the media getting a hold of this has just thrown a real wrench in the wheel, Jared's finances, Trumps finances, Starving Iran's oil sales to appease Israel and bring them to their knees
717 2018-10-17 22:46:26 I have been a Medical Marijuana patient for 2 years. I use the vaporization method which is easier on my lungs, no combustion so the taste is better and I can make oil from the left over bud. CBD is my daytime favorite.

719 2018-10-17 22:46:21 @WoodsideEnergy and @SantosLtd 3Q results today show an #oil and #gas industry that is rapidly growing and primed for more expansion. Highlight for me was WPL's 5000th #LNG cargo from #Wheatstone #energy
720 2018-10-17 22:46:13 The West daren't stand up to SA for fear of the latter restricting, or worse, stopping the flow of oil and thus doing serious harm to our economies.
721 2018-10-17 22:46:07 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
722 2018-10-17 22:46:02 Y’all would be surprised how many products have coconut oil in them. Like it’s seems like 75% of them do 
723 2018-10-17 22:45:57 It is clear that the current  international politcal and media attack on #Saudi_Arabia is aiming to obstruct the Crown Prince #MBS’s  vision and projects  to modernise, develop the Kingdom, build a strong economy away from oil and establish a national military industry.
724 2018-10-17 22:45:56 Ne mélanchons pas tout, cet homme et un gentleman. 
C'est vrai qu'il est difficile aux gens de langue d'oc de parler la langue d'oil aux accents germaniques mais ils y parviennent parfaitement en lui donnant ces sonorités qui lui manquent et qui l'enjolivent.
725 2018-10-17 22:45:48 Got elected, they weren’t expecting that to happen. You see, Obama bombed the shot out of the Middle East, caused a mass refugee effect then killed the oil industry, can you see how that aligns?
726 2018-10-17 22:45:42 That’s funny because tire rotations are free at America’s tire or basically any other tire shop. And oil changes can’t be over 60 bucks at dodge.
727 2018-10-17 22:45:41 ぇぇえええ？！
そうだよ~
728 2018-10-17 22:45:37 Saudi Arabia has 200 trillion dollars of oil.

Guess how we deal with this alleged hit.

#MAGA
729 2018-10-17 22:45:33 100MWh. 1 million bbls oil is 16 thousand times more energy and works 100% of the time Gareth. You really need to up your basic maths. Just because there is an electric plug in your wall doesn mean there is any power capacity there!
730 2018-10-17 22:45:25 Nice moves 
I'm with y'all, I don't even like people. Can I get you some oil or something?
731 2018-10-17 22:45:23 One tablespoon full of coconut oil 3 times a day. It reverses macular degeneration. Among 70 other things as well, it helps.
732 2018-10-17 22:45:21 2) IMO Sanctions against Salman will send Oil to $140 barrel again, w/ Iran under Sanctions too, @POTUS will get gas at $4.50 at Election day, Country divided+distracted while Deep State  steals @intel @Apple @pepsi @Tesla @SpaceX @IBM @generalelectric to Middle East piecemeal
733 2018-10-17 22:45:18 Remind me I have an appointment to get an oil change tomorrow at 4pm.
734 2018-10-17 22:45:12 @stevenmnuchin1 show the world you actually have a testicle. A regime that'll be selling sand in 10yrs needs US a hell of a lot more than we need them. Put the screws to #SaudiArabia . @realDonaldTrump #Saudi #KSA #MAGA #JamalKashoggi #oil #opec #opec 
735 2018-10-17 22:45:01 容量の問題じゃないと思うんだけどなぁ…
736 2018-10-17 22:44:58 Which just gave me the impression he was a wandering hobo. I might be mis-remembering - it was late at night and I was in college burning too much midnight oil.
737 2018-10-17 22:44:55 Oil is a fungible commodity. If Saudi Arabia doesn't sell to the US, we buy from someone else and their usual buyers buy from Saudi Arabia.
738 2018-10-17 22:44:44 Free Oil Change.. Thnx Mitch

741 2018-10-17 22:44:12 If you dont like the getting "high" part you could look into just some CBD oil. It has all the good effects without the psychotropic high feeling.
 I use it because it is whats legal here. Good for deppresion and chronic pain.
742 2018-10-17 22:44:10 I do! I already took a hot shower with some peppermint oil!
743 2018-10-17 22:44:01 in less than two stops on the train i put on eyeshadow, blush, a tinted balm, boy brow, perfume oil, and wrote this tweet
744 2018-10-17 22:43:51 But we need their Oil...
745 2018-10-17 22:43:41 I can recommend @HarviestounBrew Old Engine Oil if you're stuck for ale to serve.
746 2018-10-17 22:43:38 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
747 2018-10-17 22:43:37 We have given a chance to come and have our oil... if we could have just understood the meaning of unity and being in peace we could have not seen such #foolish people who doing are like this
748 2018-10-17 22:43:34 I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
749 2018-10-17 22:43:30 Maybe you are forgetting that gas (oil) is a commodity. Prices fluctuate with demand. If Americans drove sensible vehicles, we would not need Saudi oil. Therefore, no $7.00 a gallon prices would exist. BOOM!. Problem solved.
750 2018-10-17 22:43:24 ...and nor will I be able to until I find my lens oil #drat #microscopyfail
751 2018-10-17 22:43:22 I don't care about oil, weapons, money, deals, diplomacy, buddies, etc.,  but I do care about journalists who get their fingers and heads cut off by Saudi Princes.
752 2018-10-17 22:43:09 The smaller oil companies went belly up, the entire industry was hurt, in Oklahoma gas dropped bellow 2.00 a gallon, and although that sounds great  people don’t realize that it has a devastating effect on the economy. But it was planned that way, but it backfired when Trump...
753 2018-10-17 22:43:04 Facts are stubborn things for Congressman O’Rourke.
 
At last night’s #TexasDebate, he claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #TXSen
754 2018-10-17 22:42:54 TX is ranked 4, buddy. And it helps to have all the military bases ICW the oil and fracking industry. Do go on with your pointless point.
755 2018-10-17 22:42:52 Judge has a family with strong links to the oil industry Hardly impartial presumably why they were freed but judge should now be investigated
756 2018-10-17 22:42:46 @realDonaldTrump Sounds like we need more oil refineries.

760 2018-10-17 22:41:45 That's like Alfredo Oil...which isnt a thing, so this is just Olive Oil noodles.
761 2018-10-17 22:41:40 Bruh trying to justify paying 11 a month for a charger because he gets free oil changes 
762 2018-10-17 22:41:26 Now they have to send in new “Economic Hitmen” to try & buy off the new prince. This new prince may not be easily bought. So the US elite are in unknown waters this pt when it comes to dealing with the Sheik who is one of the top 3 land owners in the entire world & controls oil.
763 2018-10-17 22:41:23 We have Tesla you shit head and we produce enough oil to take care of ourselves.   
764 2018-10-17 22:41:22 The heat in sauna opens the pores up and you get a chance to detoxify your skin especially if u come from the pool u have to take a shower to rinse off any chlorine or oil! Showering after the sauna is more advisable,to cool down and close the pores. Hope it helps!
765 2018-10-17 22:41:17 We are talking about the performances of this admin bro.
Isn't that part of?
Isn't completing more projects ever than previous admins part of?
Isn't saving more even at less oil price part of?
Aren't bailing out states and paying outstanding pensions part of? 
766 2018-10-17 22:41:05 coming to an essential oil to you "essence of Phil" tones of cedar, pine, motor oil and chihuahua
767 2018-10-17 22:40:58 But kenney won’t change your fortune , when oil is getting $20-$30 a barrel and NG at all times low nothing is going to happen for a while . I have family in the patch as well , fortunately they have worked but they know if world markets to change for us things aren’t good
768 2018-10-17 22:40:58 Aloe vera gel is better than fennel oil in treating diabetic ulcers
769 2018-10-17 22:40:54 If you want moistruizer use castor oil, if you want to fight your acne use tea tree oil. It's at least for me and 14/16 other people I recommended it to very helpful. It's cheap so even if you end up like those two, you won't spend much anyway and calm your skin with rose water.
770 2018-10-17 22:40:52 What about cold pressed olive oil and rape seed oil?
771 2018-10-17 22:40:48 A big deal about a Journalist murdered by a Saudi Prince? And dismembered by a Doctor who brought a Bone Saw with him? Who cares? They sell us oil and buy our weapons. ( The last Industry still made in America) And they buy lots of Trump Real estate and fund GOP Campaigns.
772 2018-10-17 22:40:47 Would you try CBD Oil of it was FREE???
773 2018-10-17 22:40:45 I now see for the 1st time with clear eyes and ears who the enemies were who tried to take us down on 9/11. Extreme is all I see. Those who want division and would do anything to keep the divide. Some took their dirty oil to do so.
774 2018-10-17 22:40:32 .@POTUS time to cut ties with Saudi Arabia. They've always been a bad relationship to be in.  Absolute monarchies suck.  Weapons and oil aren't worth it.  Starve them of weapons and money and make them submissive.
775 2018-10-17 22:40:26 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
776 2018-10-17 22:40:17 I simply said that oil makes or breaks the economy, when oil prices are low it affects us all, it’s usually a trickle affect, in 2015 Obama made a choice that affected the oil industry it plummeted, and any economy that he tried to build went with it.
777 2018-10-17 22:40:16 “ babe come outside and chill while I clean the garage “ 
“ I’m not helping you don’t ask for anything “ 
Not even out here for 5 mins and he has me helping move a 400 pound oil drum .

783 2018-10-17 22:39:34 Like, you gotta pray for oil price spikes to help incentivize decarbonization, right?
784 2018-10-17 22:39:31 Rough when the oil ruined the ball
785 2018-10-17 22:39:31 When we used to have amaclub last year I wld buy 12x 2L & my mom's club would get about 6x 2l we would use it and give it to offertory at church and consume. It has been normal 4 me 
& many women to have several bottles of oil. Bcoz of shortages shops stopped letting us buy
786 2018-10-17 22:39:12 Just a snake oil salesman who's just as motivated by greed as anyone in DC.
787 2018-10-17 22:39:04 And I’m willing to bet that oil prices are now higher than when that speech was recorded.....
788 2018-10-17 22:38:48 The Liberals are already touting this as a great success.  They will sell this like snake oil as it is one of the few of 230 election promises they acheived.  Easy for them, they just passed the law and dumped it on the provinces to manage.  So, well done head stoner, Trudope.
789 2018-10-17 22:38:47 Opinions from the oil patch!
790 2018-10-17 22:38:45 Just got some Manila Oil and face mask stuff. I'm so bad with skin care I was about to buy everything from the store LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

799 2018-10-17 22:37:20 Whether he's an all star player or not, imo he shIdn't be suspended.  I don't know of any firm that would fire their employees for getting a DUI unless their job involved driving or working in a field that can be very dangerous - ie oil refinery.
800 2018-10-17 22:37:16 Just as useless, w/o the preacher practice.  He has a LOT of practicing to do before he can sound like the snake oil salesman Obama.
801 2018-10-17 22:37:12 I’ve been using this body oil gel for over a year, and it has my skin looking amazing
802 2018-10-17 22:37:05 Oil just said peng ting to a black guy who was pure Scottish but thought was English .... I don’t get it either
803 2018-10-17 22:37:00 It’s not just Arms unfortunately. It’s a lot of oil trade too. If Saudi Arabia decided to switch to Euros for payment instead of dollars, our stock market would crash. The country would literally come to a stand still unless we had allied support, but Trump’s destroyed that too.
804 2018-10-17 22:36:41 They want oil prices to increase before the election.
805 2018-10-17 22:36:39 Construction Industry is the major regulator of a nation's economy. The use of indigenous contractors in undertaking some major contracts is one of the major factors that would have enhanced even distribution of the 'oil money' amongst Nigerians.
806 2018-10-17 22:36:33 Why is everyone so up in arms about #CrownJewel because they allegedly killed someone. They are responsible for thousands of deaths in Yemen and nobody’s batted a eyelid for years. They support the us and keep the oil flowing. It’s foolish to think that a it will be cancelled
807 2018-10-17 22:36:31 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
808 2018-10-17 22:36:19 Squid said he’s getting Bugatti oil changes?? 
809 2018-10-17 22:36:13 If we introduced a 6 hour work day, that’s 10 hours less a week oil companies can spend fucking the world up.
810 2018-10-17 22:36:08 I just paid $75 for an oil change so there’s that. Not going back there ever again

814 2018-10-17 22:35:29 Do you have the  updated figure? it will show a truer picture because oil has improved in the international market this year and output has been stable too!
815 2018-10-17 22:35:19 I've already used such things before and hasn't done that to me. (Probably because I have oil problems sometimes.)
816 2018-10-17 22:35:17 @Oxhorn I used parmasean reggiano (sp?) cheese rinds from the local uber healthy foody store, almonds, olive oil, oh yeah and parsley from the community garden as well.
817 2018-10-17 22:35:11 We raise in excess of £50 billion per year not including oil revenue. We receive £33 billion back. We need attached to England to keep them afloat.

819 2018-10-17 22:35:10 the evil mobster GOP government cares ONLY about power, control and money. 

we no longer need their scummy oil. the petrodollar is gasping its last breath.
820 2018-10-17 22:34:55 Lets not speculate... The world knows is a vague claim. US does not need Saudi oil but American cos in Saudi do.... Are all democrats clean wrt Saudi funds past & present?
821 2018-10-17 22:34:53 It is clear that the current  international politcal and media attack on #Saudi_Arabia is aiming to obstruct the Crown Prince #MBS’s  vision and projects  to modernise, develop the Kingdom, build a strong economy away from oil and establish a national military industry.
822 2018-10-17 22:34:53 I turned on my oil diffuser at work and now the entire hallway smells nice
823 2018-10-17 22:34:49 Sheesh all this time I thought you were being facetious, but you're quite serious, aren't you. I think this convo should end. We're oil and water, mate.
824 2018-10-17 22:34:42 Time to reopen 9/11 & role of 15 hijackers from Saudi Arabia. The Khashoggi slaying questions whether, to keep oil & Mideast partnership. we've been overlooking Saudi opposition to the US. Maybe they're no better than Iraq was, or Iran is. Maybe we gotta treat em like our enemies
825 2018-10-17 22:34:21 "My best cloning was done while listening to Midnight Oil," says @Bayer head of R&D Bob Reiter about his passion for agriculture and Australian culture at the #NFFCongress. @NationalFarmers
826 2018-10-17 22:34:19 Yeah don't do Walmart. I've also heard of them draining the oil, realizing they need to move the car, then driving the car without oil to move it.

828 2018-10-17 22:34:13 hehe :) (as close as) pure sativa oil is powerful medicine, not intended for every day use but I can see Doc using it on daily basis :)
829 2018-10-17 22:34:12 It was partly composed of leading members of industry, especially oil and gas. And they agreed with the carbon tax approach. Do YOUR research.
830 2018-10-17 22:34:10 wontons with chili oil hoLy FUCK
831 2018-10-17 22:34:07 We would not impoverish our nation or our children by finding alternative forms of clean energy, you know that. Instead, Trump is allowing for offshore drilling on every U.S. ocean coast...oh, except for Fl. of course. How many oil spills have we had so far in the last 10 years?
832 2018-10-17 22:33:55 Are you suggesting Calgary sucks so had not even a car can pull away from Red Deer?'!?  ;) Go Oil Go!
833 2018-10-17 22:33:39 Kalvin got some oil for his beard and it smells amazing and I can’t stop smelling his face honestly

835 2018-10-17 22:33:29 Can I oil your scalp?
836 2018-10-17 22:33:08 Stop eating canola/rapeseed oil if you have MS I've heard. A while ago, I heard studies pointing towards it wearing away myelin nerve sheaths, I don't know if they still say that but might want to look into it. I don't have link sorry.
837 2018-10-17 22:33:06 Am I only the one that says “burn the midnight oil”? 
838 2018-10-17 22:33:05 Just as sickening as watching China dip dogs and cats into boiling oil and frying them alive.... Some cultures will never evolve out of the Stone Age. Where is @peta ???
839 2018-10-17 22:33:03 DRINK YO WATER AND USE ALMOND OIL ON YO LIPS.
840 2018-10-17 22:32:57 Add coconut oil to the list too... maybe that’s too generous to allow him lube tho...
841 2018-10-17 22:32:57 Insides in need of an oil change , where my mans at ?
842 2018-10-17 22:32:57 @2000AD Bit late, I know, but #JudgeDredd Megazine issue 400 was AMAZING. Hope all the creator droids got extra oil for that one. #comics
843 2018-10-17 22:32:55 PSA: READ COUPONS CAREFULLY. 

$10 off an oil change and $10 oil changes are very different things.
844 2018-10-17 22:32:45 Do My Brakes RT @nardyynardd: Let me go do this oil change so i can lay down.
845 2018-10-17 22:32:44 And the footnote about trade not allocated to a "region" being included in the UK figures.  That includes a lot of North Sea oil.
846 2018-10-17 22:32:39 main energy supplier in Scotland sold off all oil and coal stations now 100% clean wind powered if we can do it ………..?
847 2018-10-17 22:32:19 Do you mean 20% of Borneo's total forest has been turned over to palm oil since 1973, or 20% of the forest that has been cut down was to make way for palm oil? If it's the latter, what has the other 80% been?
848 2018-10-17 22:32:17 Not the least of it is Trump’s reading that higher oil prices will hurt him in 2020.
849 2018-10-17 22:32:16 I'm old school, on the stove in a pot with a little oil.
850 2018-10-17 22:32:15 Lol all you need is a frying pan and some oil and whatever spices you like and just fry the chicken in a pan, it’ll come out a lot better with a lot more flavor
851 2018-10-17 22:32:13 Not to brag or anything, but I can take 6-7 pills* at a time.

*Small ones. Not gigantic fish oil ones.
852 2018-10-17 22:32:09 They need that Saudi blood, I mean, oil money. Plus they have a legal obligation to go, unless the Trump Administration tells them not to go. Remember, Linda McMahon is on Trump’s cabinet.
853 2018-10-17 22:31:56 scheduled my first oil change by myself and man do i feel like an adult
854 2018-10-17 22:31:49 By far my new fav oil.  Tastes great, nice highs, if it clogs it unclogs quickly, doesn't end up on my lips, cartridges last long...really really well made
855 2018-10-17 22:31:38 Saudi money to Trump, and Yemeni oil to the Saudis. Not hard to figure out, Chuck.
856 2018-10-17 22:31:22 "Well, there goes your oil deal."
857 2018-10-17 22:31:22 I don’t have an answer. 

Until we are fully oil independent (possibly never) there isn’t much we can do without harming ourselves more than we harm them.

Pompeo is over there working with the royal family to come up with a solution for everybody’s sakes.
858 2018-10-17 22:31:20 was it making oil of Abramelin, which is based on the same oil they're talking about there?
859 2018-10-17 22:31:18 This advertising sponsored by: Western States Petroleum, Philip's 66, BP America, Andeovor, Am Fuel & Petrochem Mfrs, US Oil & Refining Co. Unfair to who u say? Lol

861 2018-10-17 22:31:12 The economic harms caused by the loss of oil export capability are so large, that it is reaching the point where the average Canadian cannot even comprehend the magnitude of what is happening. @jkenney @AndrewScheer
862 2018-10-17 22:30:59 @chigrl what do you think about oil?, do you have a new graph?
863 2018-10-17 22:30:54 I never said that..we dont need Saudi oil, so why are we even thinking about sanctions and arms money.  I say yes, wait for the facts, but everyone in the world knows what actually happened.  Trump interests personal interest in Saudi is easy to see.
864 2018-10-17 22:30:46 Please tell me you’re dropping spiders in cooking oil...
865 2018-10-17 22:30:43 most definately.....Total shutdown inna da oil city #wildseduction18
866 2018-10-17 22:30:42 Look at the footnote too.  That covers a lot of North Sea oil.

871 2018-10-17 22:30:23 I forgot to mention the Oil.
872 2018-10-17 22:30:19 Interesting Romans used olive oil not just for cooking + lamp light but also as a soap substitute, smearing their bodies with it and then scraping it off again ('Rebuilding the Ancient City', BBC4).
873 2018-10-17 22:30:17 Will be interesting to see how this plays out considering the EU have mechanisms in place to buy Iranian oil
874 2018-10-17 22:30:09 It’s definitely not only 2.50! That amount increases once the price of oil increases! So based on these increases, the cost of freight to transport the goods also increases, the cost of raw materials likewise increases & so on & on! Where’s your 2.50?
875 2018-10-17 22:30:00 EVERY TIME. my momma still do shit like this and I live on my own. “put oil in that car” mean while I did it last week 
876 2018-10-17 22:29:40 Doterra essential oil use the one called breathe
877 2018-10-17 22:29:33 @NicolleDWallace no mystery why Trump has to support Saudis, while he’s carrying their water on Iran sanctions, the potential supply fall has pushed oil prices up $20, if Saudis even temp fall back on supply oil would blow out another $20 before mit-terms!
878 2018-10-17 22:29:28 You didnt develop the fields for free. You got paid for that. It is our land, oil and money. We do what we want do with it. you dont have any Right to punish or control. We obey and bow only to our god
879 2018-10-17 22:29:13 My new car ratted me out to dealer that it needs oil change! That's hilarious yet creepy. I happened to have gotten the service yesterday so all good. Glad our other car doesn't do that or I'd be in trouble lol

882 2018-10-17 22:29:04 We helped create the mideast as is, by propping up dictators and royals to keep their countries under control so our oil companies could make a ton of money with the brutal regimes. We're hated for our part in denying people their freedom. Now we're 1st in exporting weapons/war.

886 2018-10-17 22:28:42 Thank you @senatorscarnati for your leadership in supporting the conventional oil and gas industry and for voting yes on HB2154 which is crucial the north western PA economy. I can only hope @GovernorsOffice understands how critical this is to our entire region
887 2018-10-17 22:28:42 Maybe don’t I don’t know murder someone for oil blood money?
888 2018-10-17 22:28:42 Theory: the leg represents the US dependency on foreign oil. Will we ever cut it off? Probably not.
889 2018-10-17 22:28:36 So much history behind all this. If you use a public library, I would recommend looking on their shelves. History of the Ottomans starts centuries ago. They conquered many countries, who got independence after WW1. But some controlled by West for oil.  Islamic sects. Etc
890 2018-10-17 22:28:36 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

893 2018-10-17 22:28:30 It’s easy to explain. They have oil and gas. We sell weapons to all sides involved. It all comes down to money. We have no allies there. It’s foolish to think so. We need to stay out of the beehive. We keep getting stung.
894 2018-10-17 22:28:25 It's 3pm. Time to wipe the oil off my forehead.

903 2018-10-17 22:27:25 So an American company has come up with a revolutionary new car that is now out-selling Mercedes & BMW in the USA while reduceing greenhouse emissions...and you badmouth them?

WTF is wrong with you?  Are you shilling oil for your Saudi dictator pal Mohammed Bone Sawman?
904 2018-10-17 22:27:11 Your and my particular conversation was about the economy, and oil is the economy, mine ad your Rabbi biddies conversation was caged children, he never responded to my tweets, Brittni and my conversation was more of an all around political conversation of which is rhetorical.
905 2018-10-17 22:27:04 He did not go there to discuss anything, PERIOD. He went there to Appease them, so they would not raise their Prices on Oil. The World is Watching and We are Not COOL-AID Drinking, Trump Followers. @SenateGOP @SenateDems Need to get it together.
906 2018-10-17 22:26:52 The panelists want to see us saber rattle and punish SA. Then when OPEC drastically cuts production, and the price of oil skyrockets, the economy will sour. As oil gets to $170/b, the panelists will blame @Potus for the economic downturn.
907 2018-10-17 22:26:52 So nice to hear from you Mhairi. You've been so quiet recently. can you now tell is where the secret oil fields are?
908 2018-10-17 22:26:46 I’ve worked enviro in Ohio over 30-yrs. These small oil & gas wild cat producers are the most destructive next to strip mining.

910 2018-10-17 22:26:39 Unionists had 100 years to sell the union. That would’ve involved sharing and respect. It couldn’t be done that way so it was imposed. 
Don’t cry foul when nationalists have rejected the union, accept the blame, take your oil. 
The death of the union will be by its exclusivity.

913 2018-10-17 22:26:25 That is funny. Sweden is a small country that limits immigration . The socialist programs are funded by state owned oil leases. It could not possibly maintain these programs if their population doubled let alone get near our size. Strike one . Any other wild guesses ?
914 2018-10-17 22:26:14 Everyone knows the 7th Commandment : Thou shall not kill (unless you can get away with it by using your oil money to fund lucrative arm sales to countries that have given up the moral high ground)... Some of that may not have made it to the tablets.

926 2018-10-17 22:24:22 That’s what the garlic butter is for. My attempt is modeled after the calzone ms I had at Pizza Town II as a kid where they used the garlic oil from the pan of garlic knots.

943 2018-10-17 22:23:26 Because some peanut in government said it’s acceptable because Australia has one on the lowest oil something or other in tbe world and our petrol is cheaper than a lot of other places.. so that makes it acceptable apparently
944 2018-10-17 22:23:16 Good point considering Saudi's history with human rights..... but will American cos stop buying oil from Saudi?

948 2018-10-17 22:23:06 So, I'm totally and completely ignorant about weed. But I'm told that cannabis oil can help alleviate pain. So is this something that can only be obtained at the pot shops, or elsewhere? Not sure where that fits in the picture.

951 2018-10-17 22:22:40 The government has always seen Ireland as a small player...no oil, no fracking, no gold or diamonds...extreme capitalists have no interest unless there's a lot of money.
952 2018-10-17 22:22:37 But, like the oil and gas column, I look forward to you quoting Ben's tweet and then explaining why Ben didn't really mean it and that no one really knows in the Spinoff.
953 2018-10-17 22:22:37 I am no gamechanger, but I've seen a ton of these guys voice their opinions. Whether it's on Twitter, in their Twitch streams or in YouTube videos. There are things that the higher ups listen to and obviously a ton they didnt. The saying goes, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
954 2018-10-17 22:22:35 Didnt they say the same about north sea oil... 
955 2018-10-17 22:22:31 I’m convinced anyone that chooses to paint with acrylic over oil sold their soul to the devil
956 2018-10-17 22:22:28 Just hanging at @subaruofspokane for a scheduled oil change and tire changeover appointment ... for two hours and counting. Did I mention there’s an infant in daycare today, so I should be taking advantage and napping right now? #notamused #aintnobodygottimeforthat #babythuglife
957 2018-10-17 22:22:24 All past world calamities 9/11, RFK, JFK JR, King, Assigns. back to when FED RES was voted illegally into the U.S. Wars U.S. Crimes the Satan worshipers, Wealthy Bankers & Oil Barons The ,(NWO)are guilty of. US citizens not evil enough to do it, but blamed for it.We want JUSTICE

959 2018-10-17 22:22:05 Thanks. These stories mean a lot to me. Like you, I have Lupus. I don’t need pain meds yet, but I’m young. There’s still time. Right now I’m hitting the CBD oil and hemp really hard.

961 2018-10-17 22:21:59 Very nice to see fossil fuel companies losing value.

Eventually the oil companies are going to sharply lose value like coal companies did. Just need to keep pushing plug-in car costs down.
962 2018-10-17 22:21:55 Like them Texas boys I keep some oil
963 2018-10-17 22:21:53 Truth check: NONE OF THE $110 billion arms deal to Saudi Arabia  identified so far are  new, all began in the Obama admin. So far nothing has been sent to the Senate for review. Because of low oil prices and Yemen war...there will be no deal with Saudi's! trump lies AGAIN!!
964 2018-10-17 22:21:45 keeping the cheap oil coming?
965 2018-10-17 22:21:25 Psalm 23: 5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
966 2018-10-17 22:21:20 Now when my hair was short products with coconut oil worked but actual cocunut oils didn’t. Now neither works just leaves me with dry scalp and brittle hair that looks like water hasn’t touched it in months!!

969 2018-10-17 22:21:07 “Kush has the qualifications because POTUS thinks so.”


Drumpf thought an oil company CEO was qualified to be SoS, a surgeon qualified to be HUD director, and a foreign agent qualified to be his campaign chair - the 1st quit, 2nd is incompetent, & the 3rd is in jail ...
970 2018-10-17 22:21:07 Ya, pero que desaparezca el andaluz o el murciano no te da pena, y que el flamenco del Westhoek ya no exista te importa un rábano, y que todas las lengua de Oíl desaparezcan igual. El problema es si un valenciano de 14 años no habla como su abuela, y si es tortosí, da igual...

973 2018-10-17 22:20:50 So lets go after them for this it didn't even happen in the usa who is ready to pay the price of oil and gas when they hike it up or shut it off
974 2018-10-17 22:20:48 My favorite part is when the sniper is trying to shoot Navin, but is hitting the cans of oil and he says, "The cans...he HATES the cans!!"
975 2018-10-17 22:20:43 I am aware of the damages of palm oil. I have seen on a few sites including their own policy that they use sustainable palm oil.
976 2018-10-17 22:20:32 [comms brainstorm] don't laugh, but my grappling hook is jammed and i'm stuck hanging over the oil reservoir, please help
977 2018-10-17 22:20:29 she is no oil painting either.
978 2018-10-17 22:20:27 VicRoads' non-solution. Reminds me of joke fault report: evidence of oil leak in right engine [of commercial jet]. Fix: evidence removed.
979 2018-10-17 22:20:19 Pretty sure there was no misunderstanding.  They weren't listening in the first place nor do they give two shits about him, the US or anyone else for that matter.  They are a law unto themselves and will not be held accountable. Oil and Money!
980 2018-10-17 22:20:17 Glove oil bro chill
981 2018-10-17 22:20:17 While Canadians appreciate discussing your plan, it’s insufficient and we need to do more. And it’s clear we can’t expand oil sands production at all
982 2018-10-17 22:20:12 Nigga getting an oil change every weekend?!
983 2018-10-17 22:20:09 The drunk Irishman wanted to put a 10$ tax on a barrel of oil I saw it
984 2018-10-17 22:20:01 Commodities: Coffee +4.04%, Lean Hogs -3.82%
Top commodity gainers are Coffee (4.04%), Sugar (3.62%) and Natural gas (2.16%). Biggest losers are Lean Hogs (-3.82%), Crude Oil (-2.84%) and Gasoline (-2.80%).
985 2018-10-17 22:19:58 Something about the coconut oil literally sets my scalp on fire! I thought products with coconut oil were okay but they aren’t either. My hair is dry and lifeless so that meme that coconut oil makes your life better didn’t work for me. Literally the opposite has made my life hell
986 2018-10-17 22:19:57 Took me a year to feel normal coming off of them. Cbd oil helped
987 2018-10-17 22:19:57 Hope you know with fall in oil prices, massive generalized infrastructural work going, PMB has saved more than he borrowed. He sincerely cares for the future.
988 2018-10-17 22:19:46 Smoother than coconut oil 
989 2018-10-17 22:19:44 I do a few things lol nah but my knees getting light thanks to coconut oil and Shea butter lol

993 2018-10-17 22:18:53 I believe that everyone should try olive oil at least once in their lives
994 2018-10-17 22:18:51 Ultimately, I think it's still just difficult to be in favor of universal health "insurance" and a big oil tax and win in TX. I get that he's trying to appeal to GOP moderate women with the Molly stories, but they seem to have figured out very late that's probably not gonna do it
995 2018-10-17 22:18:50 Get your oil change done on a regular basis. You don’t want this to happen to you. All that built up slug should not be there.
996 2018-10-17 22:18:46 Jamaican Castro oil i oil my scalp w it
997 2018-10-17 22:18:46 I once ate an entire pie that had over 140 doses of oil. I saw the walls liquefy and the sky was changing colors. I also saw tree limbs turn into hands. All in two days.
998 2018-10-17 22:18:40 Decided to try an “authentic Mexican restaurant” .....they up charge carne asada, they put lettuce and cheese on the taco, dip the tortilla in oil and coook it... I asked for salsa and got chip dip :(
999 2018-10-17 22:18:22 While the world is cashing in on another oil boom, Canada is dumbing down its populace with legal weed. We are so f***ed.
1000 2018-10-17 22:18:15 Saudi Arabia is literally a absolute monarchy with a shit ton of oil, USA consumes a shit ton of oil, what u gonna expect..
1001 2018-10-17 22:18:10 See the only problem w dat is I only smoke CBD, or take the oil
1002 2018-10-17 22:18:02 Have you gotten your three servings of coconut oil today? Bonus points if it's sprouted.
1003 2018-10-17 22:17:58 Usually in a mixture of things. It works well for the face other than rose hip mixed with sweet almond oil but my rose hip and sweet almond oil is oil.
1004 2018-10-17 22:17:56 Be serious. It’s a pyramid scheme and none of it is FDA approved. I don’t waste money on snake oil.
1005 2018-10-17 22:17:53 "In general, there’s a correlation between oil resources and widespread poverty. Economists have come up with many explanations for this correlation. Oil exports tend to push up a country’s exchange rate, making it less competitive in other industries."
1006 2018-10-17 22:17:43 Scotland can't be that bad off if they can throw away money to snake oil salespeople.
1007 2018-10-17 22:17:27 Alhamdulillah
1008 2018-10-17 22:17:10 No I don’t prefer that. This province needs a PST to address our revenue shortage because of depressed oil prices. One day, Oil revenues will not be there anymore. Norway knows this, that is why they built up a 1 trillion dollar savings fund. We need to build a stronger future.
1009 2018-10-17 22:16:43 Oil of oregano helps too
1010 2018-10-17 22:16:34 I doubt it. Unfortunately $ talks. The & $110bn deal signed by Saudi King  & Trump for purchase of US arms is worth more than any lives. 61% of SA arms supplied by US, 23% by U.K. That’s why, amongst other leverage  like Oil & owning $100bn + US debt, the US  and U.K. pussyfoot.
1011 2018-10-17 22:16:30 Would love to see oil prices drop! Climbing steady and it’s getting COLD up here!
1012 2018-10-17 22:16:23 Ha, I’m limited on what I’ve tried besides the good old bud. I’ve done some dabs, some wax concentrate and tried a thc oil cart. It’s hard to get here and I don’t trust most folks not to poison my ass that can get it. 
1013 2018-10-17 22:16:22 @claycooleygroup CDJ in Irving Texas needs to get their heads out of their a$$. Had my truck for 30 days. Main complaint engine knock. Tried to blame oil change company. They have video proof not their fault. Today their solution is put more oil in with dye and drive it some more
1014 2018-10-17 22:16:19 Prudent my black foot! When your population is ballooning? It means Buhari will borrow more and leave debts for the 3rd generation. All indices show that at this rate & if oil crashes again (soon), Nigeria willbbecome insolvent. If you live abroad, you're safe, if not na wahala
1015 2018-10-17 22:16:18 If Qaddafi had succeeded, the U.S and Europe would have been forced to buy oil and minerals in the gold backed currency thus tipping the scales !
1016 2018-10-17 22:16:17 Cares about America, oil embargo apparently wasn't taught in your history class.
1017 2018-10-17 22:16:00 It would be bad if they knew about it... But... They have oil and they want to buy our peacemaking hardware. They wanna buy a lot of it. They wanna make so much peace #tytlive

1021 2018-10-17 22:15:32 Yes,  move out of the dark ages and stop being ludicrous.  Legalise cbd oil while you're at it.
1022 2018-10-17 22:15:30 It’s a great look for Oil, best player in the world! Dusters or not he is with Oil for along time! I think mcdavid will break the 150 pts this year! All by himself. At least he doesn’t need to be traded to grow the game in the states
1023 2018-10-17 22:15:28 When @PChidambaram_IN had come up with the formula of sharing the oil price rise during #UPA , @arunjaitley had criticised him. Lo and behold 5 years later, he does the same thing.
1024 2018-10-17 22:15:27 More snake oil by slippery May.
1025 2018-10-17 22:15:18 Hmm, short could be good down to ,20 or so.. we’ll se #oott #oil $cl_f stop staying above 71.02, otherwise will monitor and update
1026 2018-10-17 22:15:18 If they hadn't discovered oil in Saudi Arabia they'd still be riding camels and living in tents. So, no, it is not a mature society.

1031 2018-10-17 22:14:52 There is a word for it but i can't remember you lot use in usa for a ballot that has a positive and what seems a personnel negative , they relying on the ignorance of masses to vote no on it for the personnel limitation so they keep oil drilling ,
1032 2018-10-17 22:14:52 Shoulda watch the Oil comeback instead
1033 2018-10-17 22:14:50 First you get the oil
Then you get the money
Then you get the Americans
1034 2018-10-17 22:14:30 I don't get out much, but when I do, I hear 'gas prices are too high.' This is from very poor folk tryin to get around. I hated to bring up our frail ecosystem, or how are we going to get off oil if govts. subsidize, fight wars for & destroy local land to obtain? What abt r kids?
1035 2018-10-17 22:14:29 Have you tried CBD oil for your Fibro?  My sis uses it for her RA and says it helps.  #similarbutnotthesamething
1036 2018-10-17 22:14:24 Actually, we don't need anybody.
Most need oil and we got plenty.

1052 2018-10-17 22:12:54 Excellent @IAMKP gig at Cadogan Hall: complex, beautiful and clever songs, with added oil refinery.
1053 2018-10-17 22:12:46 They won’t. Trumps dirty in this and it all has to do with money and oil
1054 2018-10-17 22:12:40 So trump is backing the saudis because they're fighting iran on the terrorism front, but remind me again where 15 of the terrorist on 9-11 came from??? America is such a whore for oil...
1055 2018-10-17 22:12:39 How come every time he rules, things go bad for Nig. Scarcity of everything and oil boom drops. Why why why.... Pls he has badluck on him

1057 2018-10-17 22:12:32 Heard you on @AriMelber show and agree 100 percent Trump is part of the coverup!

The republicans like @LindseyGrahamSC and others are giving lip service and will do NOTHING about the Saudis
All about MONEY and OIL!

9-11 Saudi involvement

Oil manipulation Saudis

Screw them
1058 2018-10-17 22:12:24 So we always know where to get more oil, if needed- Venezuela and Iran!
1059 2018-10-17 22:12:18 So GOP policy is to keep America hooked on oil and stymy development of solar and wind-power. And then also use our reliance on oil to justify pro-Saudi policy in the middle east. 
1060 2018-10-17 22:12:12 Let’s be real.  In trump’s eyes, oil and the money he and #JaredKushner owe the #Saudis are far more important than #Mr. Kashoggi. @cspanwj

1062 2018-10-17 22:12:00 Nope. It can be buried. 

Think about an artificial version of the natural processes that captured all the carbon in oil/coal/peat in the first place: growing plants to capture carbon, then locking it up by burial.

1064 2018-10-17 22:11:52 So my brother will have to do an oil change.
1065 2018-10-17 22:11:47 ...actual separation. The First Nations made Africa and the Americas in their image just as Eurasia did, but more gently. Worse, cities are inherently unsustainable and cannot be made sustainable any more than oil, solar panels, wind generators or a McD's burger. Yet, cities. 5/?
1066 2018-10-17 22:11:46 #TYTLive Trump and the Saudis-a match made in corruption heaven. And this is what both parties being in  bed with the Saudis fro decades gets us. Oil for blood begets murder when you have a corrupt president who doesn't give a shit about the emoluments clause.
1067 2018-10-17 22:11:40 Yea we have a specific address for that but you get our gist. We can definitely get behind the /dominance/ of oil as /symptomatic/ of changes in the structure of econopolitical system.
1068 2018-10-17 22:11:39 SA should not be an ally. 
So many human rights abuses.
The US does not need them. There is enough oil in the US.  #tytlive

1072 2018-10-17 22:10:53 It’s the Saudi/Arab way. But we must excuse them everything as they buy arms, have lots of oil and hate Iran.
1073 2018-10-17 22:10:51 And after several bottles of wine, stay tuned for the hot oil wrestling! 
1074 2018-10-17 22:10:51 They are in Surrey and Sussex with lots of licensed sites, but there has been little interest in Bed, Bucks and Herts because of the geology.  Basically, not enough deposits of shale.  You go where the oil bearing deposits are.  Also I guess, the denser population creates issues.
1075 2018-10-17 22:10:50 That looks cool.  Is it an oil painting? Looks about 5’ tall 
1076 2018-10-17 22:10:50 Oil, no. Hi Chews, yes.
1077 2018-10-17 22:10:46 How will you know who didn’t hear, me and my husband didn’t hear the question where the answer was snake oil
1078 2018-10-17 22:10:45 watch the dust bowl... MAN made cc.. and it took ppl to fix it... ppl were starving and dying bc they were choking on the dust.oil industry etc highly subsidised, not cost effective and dangerous.

1081 2018-10-17 22:10:36 Bears ears and all the national monuments that secretary of the interior zinke is opening up and selling for oil and gas extraction are sacred religious places to Native American tribes. They’re equivalent to cathedrals and violate their national sovereignty. Mt. Rushmore too.

1086 2018-10-17 22:10:04 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1087 2018-10-17 22:09:58 Best advice I can give you when it comes to cars...

Buy a Honda! You can drive a Honda for 20 years and only pay the oil change once 
1088 2018-10-17 22:09:54 Because the Saudis are loaded with petrodollars, own shitloads of London and control the oil.. Russia are the worlds bad guys again, just where we like them!
1089 2018-10-17 22:09:46 #SaudiArabia would be as relevant as Taiwan if they didn't have oil to cajole the world. I'll be glad when nasty stinking fossil fuels are a thing of the past and the Saudis turn to sand. By 2030 many countries will only have renewal energy including automobiles...Buh Bye Saudis!
1090 2018-10-17 22:09:44 My Mum just shared a post about an ethical producer of CBD oil. I love her

1092 2018-10-17 22:09:36 OPEC will never cut production (WTI 40).  
OPEC will never stick to production cuts (WTI 50).  
Shale will overwhelm demand (WTI 60).  
Economy/oil price will destroy demand (WTI 70). 
Material increase in long-term FID's (0).

1095 2018-10-17 22:09:17 The people of #Pennsylvania deserve to know what chemicals oil and gas companies are pumping into the ground.  Vote NO on #HB2154 to protect #PA families!
1096 2018-10-17 22:09:08 Hey, that oil tax is a good idea !!  We need less oil anyway as we're producing more and more AND we progress with clean alternatives.
1097 2018-10-17 22:09:07 That was then ...let’s talk about now 

Saudis  : hey Donald we have the raise the oil prices 

Donald : but why 

Saudis : because we can 

Donald : fucking do it
1098 2018-10-17 22:08:53 Bearish open , let’s see if it balances or gets directional. #oott #oil $cl_f

What are his plans after he leaves trumps clan? Will he take his share of the money and disappear? Will he become a lobbiest for Big Oil?
1101 2018-10-17 22:08:42 That settles it then. I'm running down to the store to buy a veritable shit ton of olive oil! Stat! Gonna douse it all over the place. Ladies, you should drink it straight from the bottle! Seriously, though, olives are good for you and olive oil, while a bit fattening, is great.
1102 2018-10-17 22:08:35 Snake oil salesman Sir
1103 2018-10-17 22:08:31 It certainly is and him being the MEP that voted the least should have shown his voters exactly what a snake oil salesman he is.
1104 2018-10-17 22:08:30 You pay wth cooking oil???
1105 2018-10-17 22:08:23 Hit vitamin shop. Buy concentrated oregano oil. 2-3 drops a few times a day when sick. Works like butta
1106 2018-10-17 22:08:21 I rub her down in oil
1107 2018-10-17 22:08:17 That was adorable, you peon. We should stop all weapons transfers to the Saudis after this shit. But we won’t do that because they’ll jack up oil prices which would have never been an issue if we didn’t break ties with Iran. The Saudis are playing us. 
1108 2018-10-17 22:08:14 Thank you @fordnation  for your understanding of the massive industry that has just begun in our province and country. #hemp #fuel #oil #textiles #healthcare #construction

1110 2018-10-17 22:08:06 we need their oil its that simple
1111 2018-10-17 22:08:01 Kill a few reporters...no biggie. 

Raise the fuckin' oil prices and we have a problem Saudi Face.
1112 2018-10-17 22:07:54 Weed has many positives but with anything if misused turns into an addiction everything in moderation the oil that comes from weed has more positives and helps people have a better quality of life
1113 2018-10-17 22:07:44 He’s a scumbag, snake oil salesman, con man! #basta
1114 2018-10-17 22:07:35 Aww damn you need a cbd oil massage, that shit would get you riiiiiiiiiiight
1115 2018-10-17 22:07:32 Iran 1980: armed clashes in universities, oil pipelines blown up, civil war in Kurdistan. Revolutions require sacrifice. Should this prison guard sacrifice a dissident prisoner and keep his job, or sacrifice himself to release him? #DVPit #Own #LGBT #A #F #imm
1116 2018-10-17 22:07:30 You need to stop all relations with the Saudi‘s ..let them rot!.
we made them rich and they’re spoiled rotten brats now. 
please cut them off , we have our own oil..
1117 2018-10-17 22:07:16 My coconut oil is going off and now I smell like a stale Passover macaroon.
1118 2018-10-17 22:07:14 help me cat wont stop licking my bio oil
1119 2018-10-17 22:07:12 I dont use it though, i exfoliate my lips once a week though. Honey, coconut oil, brown sugar, few drops of lemon, mix it together then rub, scrub, rinse, eazy peezy, done.
1120 2018-10-17 22:07:11 I’ll be there soon, getting my oil changed.
1121 2018-10-17 22:07:09 Ok, Liver Punch! You keep clinging to the past. I know Big Oil has done the same and will continue to do so, Earth be damned!
1122 2018-10-17 22:07:06 I've been doing honey and turmeric face masks, sometimes with cinnamon or coconut oil, and today my mother told me I looked "particularly well seasoned"
1123 2018-10-17 22:07:05 Stop the dependency on Saudi oil.
1124 2018-10-17 22:07:05 The mullahs have been playing the yoyo game of periods of hardline oppression countered with “reformist” movements, all of which is part of the same agenda, delay the real opposition and transition, because bp loves their secret oil pricing, among other things.
1125 2018-10-17 22:07:04 She just needs an oil change, new window and tire rotation. And I'm broke. I'm confident I can get her to 200k or more.
1126 2018-10-17 22:07:00 It will get worse under @jkenney cause of cuts to public services, low natural gas prices and the price of oil not $100.00PB. It takes along time to make changes to a system that’s been overly reliant on resource revenues. #ableg

Just like oil on my hands
Oh, I do love you...
1133 2018-10-17 22:06:14 To the whole original point though setting oil and gas back 1/2 mile doesn’t midigate any existing risk such as building dangerously close to existing equipment. Where in 112 does it say it will protect you?

1137 2018-10-17 22:05:55 That's fine because oil is naturally lubricating
1138 2018-10-17 22:05:47 It's arms for oil and business loans to Jared. There's loss of oil with sanctions on Iran. Always follow the money and the oil.
1139 2018-10-17 22:05:31 Trump’s Middle East policy depends on #SaudiArabia and on #MBS personally. MBS finances the US occupation in #Syria [and] sanctions against #Iran can only be sustained if Saudi oil replaces the loss of Iranian output. -Robert Steele
1140 2018-10-17 22:05:24 Vegetable ghee??? Another oxymoron! What's next? Soybean oil from unfenced fields sold as " free range organic soybean oil"?
1141 2018-10-17 22:05:20 I think Israel takes plenty of action against Syria... those stolen Golan Heights and the wanted oil pipeline are the reason...
1142 2018-10-17 22:05:16 They have oil. Nothing will happen. Best friends. Sad world.
1143 2018-10-17 22:05:06 But once an oil tanker driver had no problem holding down a full time job and serving as a deputy?
1144 2018-10-17 22:05:00 Can Discovery Place in Devon have the old oil display?  Our residents watched the oil come in all those years ago.  It would be welcomed in Devon! We are proud of our history.

I am thinking of investing and need some insight.

1155 2018-10-17 22:04:09 Ur country as well as most other western states think there is no more oil, arabs say “we got non and if u want it then pay through the nose” US say no! EU/UK say “wtf! We just made Iran deal”! Saudi say “what about us” MBrotherhood says “we don’t care cause we not there
1156 2018-10-17 22:04:04 Pompeo had the nervous giggles. Worried they would render him for the oil.
1157 2018-10-17 22:03:33 Those "regulatory reform efforts" include allowing massive toxins & pollutants now dumped into our waterways, coal ash & other chemicals to be poured into rivers, opening up or selling our public land for fracking, oil/gas drilling, extraction, etc. And climate change is real!
1158 2018-10-17 22:03:29 We don't need Saudi Arabia 

the majority of oil from the Middle East goes to Asia United States is a net oil exporter not importer

The United States doesn't need Saudi Arabia

1167 2018-10-17 22:02:54 I work in the gas/oil industry. The biggest threat is Saudi selling oil barrels for change which would cripple US unless our allies boycott them, good thing our allies love us... Oh yeah sorry, 45 has ruined that too

5 My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
    listen carefully to my wise counsel.
3 For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey,
    and her mouth is smoother than oil.
4 But in the end she is as bitter as poison.
1174 2018-10-17 22:02:13 lick em, worship em, pour oil on em, pull my dick out and start going 2 town 
1175 2018-10-17 22:02:12 The whole point of oil and gas isn’t to just poke a hole in the ground and build a well. They still need a way to transport the product but wouldn’t be able to since they can’t put in any new equipment 1/2 mile from anything.
1176 2018-10-17 22:02:05 The oil industry made Venezuala poor, not socialism. There are other, better examples out there, ya know.
1177 2018-10-17 22:02:02 I want every single person to HAVE to listen to it. Everyone who owns part of a share in Lockheed/Raytheon/Bowing etc, everyone filling their car with Saudi oil, everyone voting (or not voting) for candidates that support Saudi Arabia need to listen to what we allowed to happen
1178 2018-10-17 22:01:58 Don’t donate to Paw’d It Forward.  They are not non-profit.  They are not registered in the state, city or county.  They are taking your money for themselves.  They don’t need this oil for stray dogs, but their own.
1179 2018-10-17 22:01:56 US is a net oil exporter, leave the Middle East to Europe and China to fret over
1180 2018-10-17 22:01:47 Literally exactly the same with my grandma been looking at the oil for her
1181 2018-10-17 22:01:43 agreed... and the usual smell of garbage and artisan beard oil
1182 2018-10-17 22:01:37 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

1189 2018-10-17 22:00:33 Why can’t we just drill our own oil and stop propping up these barbaric dictators in the Middle East.

1194 2018-10-17 22:00:10 I heard somewhere that he’s trying to bring in more outside businesses to diversify outside of oil. If he doesn’t there finished once it dries up.
1195 2018-10-17 22:00:03 Because he’s a tiny oil soaked cheatoh
1196 2018-10-17 22:00:02 And he took his wife behind him, David stooped with his mouth were smoother than oil:
1197 2018-10-17 22:00:01 Hope you’re well  my friend 
1198 2018-10-17 22:00:01 How did the 60s/70s come back?

Politically polarized nation... race relations at boiling points... Saudi's threatening to "choke" the worlds oil supply... and people discussing star signs... 

It's like I'm a kid again!
1199 2018-10-17 21:59:56 Please tell me one thing Robert Frances O’Rourke is going to do for the state of Texas?? Open borders? No thank you. He feels safe in El Paso, of course it has a wall. $10 tax on every barrel of oil? Why? Seriously what is he going to do for honest hard-working Texan like myself?
1200 2018-10-17 21:59:55 African black/Castile soap and tea tree oil 
1201 2018-10-17 21:59:28 One of the best responses to this atrocity is to plan on buying a #Tesla or another EV.  A significant drop in the demand for oil is a fitting response.
1202 2018-10-17 21:59:26 Ok, so that’s it.  That’s what got me banned from Facebook.  People do far worse and nothing is done to their accounts.  All the money and oil that ever was and will be is not even close to the worth of one man murdered for disagreeing with tyrants.
1203 2018-10-17 21:59:21 walk into Walmart happen to look to my right and a old lady is drinking oil... out of the bottle. Okay sis I see you. (:
1204 2018-10-17 21:59:13 Great time to be a snake oil salesman
1205 2018-10-17 21:58:57 Oil is pretty dangerous but, to each his own ://
1206 2018-10-17 21:58:51 Also oil companies are still supporting politicians who wouldn't vote for a carbon tax even if the ghost of Ronald Reagan lobbied for it
1207 2018-10-17 21:58:49 why you did not talk about the Bulgarian journalist lady???? she raped and killed

FT is not a professional because you are planning to do something before you know the truth, and your saying lies to readers.
1208 2018-10-17 21:58:40 Think about the poor whalers. Whale oil makes great candles.  Make America Candlelit Again.
1209 2018-10-17 21:58:38 Oil at a time of declining use of fossil fuels isn't a great position.  UK military contributes more to the Scottish economy than Scotland pays e.g. Rosyth. Adopting its own currency would be suicide, adopting the Euro would see economic control from Berlin rather than London.
1210 2018-10-17 21:58:21 Stop sending ppl to war for oil & other ppl's resources.
1211 2018-10-17 21:58:17 Because an oil spill could kill off the algae bloom
1212 2018-10-17 21:58:15 Thats my girl right there!  need more baby oil 
1213 2018-10-17 21:58:10 I hope that my comments get more people using these products. The 24K lip oil treatment is way better than just lipgloss. My lips won't get chapped in the dry Colorado air this winter. Thanks McKenzie for the products.
1214 2018-10-17 21:58:04 Dude, you really got to stop with that line. It’s just plain lies.  They campaigned on some form of climate action. The carbon tax is the climate action they thought was best after research. Nobel Prize winners and oil execs agree FFS.  But your plan will be better? LMFAO. #ableg
1215 2018-10-17 21:57:47 Oh yea. Iraq was a HUGE success. They lined the streets welcoming us. And the oil, OMG, the free oil just came pouring in. Another Saudi attack? Maybe invade Turkey now. Lol
1216 2018-10-17 21:57:35 Do you have any peppermint oil or Vics?
1217 2018-10-17 21:57:30 Fellow Kanawan dabo with conscience, let us prove to the influencers and planners of this ridiculous #GandunAiki that we are wiser than before, let us make them pay for milking us dry, let's destroy the shameful aim of this hash tag
1218 2018-10-17 21:57:28 My favorite? Penne will asparagus and prosciutto. Oh, and save some of that pasta water along with garlic, olive oil and lots of Romano cheese. We Southern Italians know how to do it right. 

#NationalPastaDay
1219 2018-10-17 21:57:08 Oil, fossil fuels is killing us literally. 
Over 1 million people died of air pollution in India alone in 2015. Many more since. And the extraction industry and protecting them with our military has resulted in many other totally unnecessary deaths. 
Change or die, our choice.
1220 2018-10-17 21:57:06 Canadia is about to hav a new primary export to the US!! Screw a fossil fuel pipeline give us a Honey Oil pipeline!! Just imagine bubbles oil refinery ramped up to scale and then Trump will magically disappear as eyes become half opened 
1221 2018-10-17 21:56:53 Canola oil spread, is vegtable based arent eggs eggs unfertalized
1222 2018-10-17 21:56:43 And how do you know either are or are not, what evidence do you have that t/Turks didn't, or the overwhelming indicators that Saudi did not.  The same MO as Regeni murder.  Timing is impeccable, Oil price pressure from t/ US, Pressure from Israel because of Jerusalem stance
1223 2018-10-17 21:56:41 Ur a fucking tool! Ur government is far right! They are capitalists and u have a queen!! They pretending to be far left but all they want is Arab oil. And ur fucking helping them! Tool #qanon #tommyrobinson #wwg1wga
1224 2018-10-17 21:56:40 Oil of Oregano. Family swears by it.
1225 2018-10-17 21:56:31 3 main points. 1. war for anything other than our rights is racket   2. Racket is not what it seems to the general public. Only a select few can see it for what it is, racket   3. Soldiers pay the highest price for America’s profit (ex:oil)
1226 2018-10-17 21:56:25 Jokes on Morgan. Yes there is an infant in the papoose. There is also a flame thrower, poison blow darts and a device that releases an oil slick! ... probably some Germy Gel as well.. cold and flu season and all.
1227 2018-10-17 21:56:23 the year is 2018, Simon is captured by the u.s and became a slave to drill holes on earth for oil
1228 2018-10-17 21:56:17 I was going to say broken volkswagon burning oil... but hey :)
1229 2018-10-17 21:56:10 Coconut oil & cinnamon. Both are antiviral, antibacterial  & antifungal!
1230 2018-10-17 21:56:08 that’s it.. I’m quitting school to become an essential oil saleswoman
1231 2018-10-17 21:55:59 Luckily my even higher level of anger at existential political threats to existence largely masks my constant rage at mere digital snake oil salesmen.
1232 2018-10-17 21:55:39 That pic is from a dig there in the 90s I think, over Oil. Pretty cool quote he has in that pic. Me likey.
1233 2018-10-17 21:55:30 Yes, you choose oil and power.
1234 2018-10-17 21:55:14 How shameless and ridiculous, can it get worse than this? Our youths are not ready for any meaningful development, how can you sell your conscience to trend  #GandunAiki , worse of if all they're strangers n lack basic info to buttress the hash tag.
1235 2018-10-17 21:55:13 Why does the US, Canada and Mexico care about Saudi Oil? They have enough.
1236 2018-10-17 21:55:07 Norway and Scotland are relatively similar in terms of population and oil & gas reserves.  They have a £1.1 trillion Sovereign wealth fund whereas Scotland has record numbers of food bank parcels.  Do you really think the Union is good for Scotland 
1237 2018-10-17 21:55:03 My cousin just popped in to dash me a bottle of perfume oil . Thanks alot bro @ibbenbako 
1238 2018-10-17 21:55:00 @samsdatdude @jjasso21 Badass beard oil
1239 2018-10-17 21:54:59 Figures just out from Electricity Authority show a big jump in solar installs, 300 homes are now going solar every month. Yet oil & gas industry keep arguing for more fossil fuels as the only option we have.
1240 2018-10-17 21:54:55 I hated to leave my grad school projects, but changing to isolating 50 g of crystalline material instead of 10 mg of intractable oil was a good change of pace.

Enjoy!
1241 2018-10-17 21:54:52 Ana I love you but I haven't seen anyone get riled up over this horrible act. And don't get me started on Pompeo's ridiculous, wasted trip to Saudi Arabia. It will all be swept under the rug in favor of oil and arms deals. Disgusting.
1242 2018-10-17 21:54:51 Yes he was & it’s wrong. But we buy oil from Saudi. They buy over $110b of arms (resulting in jobs). They r needed to control Iran. They could allow Russia to set military bases. They r needed for Middle East stability. We can be tough and should be- but w diplomacy. B patient.
1243 2018-10-17 21:54:45 working at nandos is all fun and games until you have burns from the chip oil that splashed all up your arm and on ur shoulder where it's gone through your tshirt.
1244 2018-10-17 21:54:36 I’m gonna go get my oil... wait what?
1245 2018-10-17 21:54:35 4) -a worldwide famine before 1999, that the oil reserves would be depleted by the Millennium, or that the Arctic #PolarIce Cap would disappear by 2014 - all of which have proved to be demonstrably wrong - as well as the confession by environmental scientists that they falsified-
1246 2018-10-17 21:54:26 Tea tree oil helps as a spot treatment, and for me the neutrogena & african black soap bars helped mine go away in 3 days
1247 2018-10-17 21:54:23 Once again that sounds like the USA. OUR GAS PRICES GOING UP! OUR GROCERIES GOING UP. OUR OIL GOING UP. OH AND BLACK PPL ARE VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED EVERY OTHER DAY HERE IN THE USA. SO FORGIVE THE USA FOR NOT STOPPING TO HELP YOU WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS WE GOT. SMH
1248 2018-10-17 21:54:21 I took before pictures of my acne, and started used frankincense essential oil. Let’s see how this goes.
1249 2018-10-17 21:54:19 You get oil for head
1250 2018-10-17 21:54:11 Gold diggers dig until they find oil.
1251 2018-10-17 21:54:06 one dismembered journalist vs barrels of oil 
1252 2018-10-17 21:53:59 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1253 2018-10-17 21:53:50 Coastal cities may be worth more than the oil industry but they don't employ an army of lobbyists so it doesn't matter.
1254 2018-10-17 21:53:46 There's no way the entire oil and gas industry would get eliminated. This has do with setbacks from houses and schools, not affecting BFE with nothing but cows.
1255 2018-10-17 21:53:40 Badass beard oil @LAINDIA928 @bra
1256 2018-10-17 21:53:37 2of6: @encana, stating "85% of energy comes from coal, oil & gas" does not mean that people living in #energypoverty must use coal, oil & gas to be lifted out of poverty. It means that #DevelopedCountries (skewing your #s) are too dependent on carbon-intense fuels. #ClimateCrisis
1257 2018-10-17 21:53:30 Of course they are OK. If it's between oil at 200$ and a million Americans dead, so long as it's not them, they're fine with everything.
1258 2018-10-17 21:53:20 Yes,  the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins. The anointing come through obedience. This the oil not only in the lamp but extra. One obeyed his Lord the other did not.
1259 2018-10-17 21:53:14 i mean the oil is good for your hair but i think 2 days is good?
1260 2018-10-17 21:53:00 cooking oil, chete
1261 2018-10-17 21:52:58 Got oil changed now I need a break light, it would be nice if a guy could just do all this for me 
1262 2018-10-17 21:52:56 Depending on how well it has been maintained (oil changes,servicing) I’ve seen 500k.
1263 2018-10-17 21:52:55 Because Trump & Kushner took $$$millions from SA in loans, we won’t hear a peep from them. Unfortunately K’s murder won’t cause much beyond ‘thoughts & prayers’ cuz of oil, $, Iran etc
1264 2018-10-17 21:52:52 I use baby oil but idk that’s just me. It works for my skin rlly well
1265 2018-10-17 21:52:48 Made "bulletproof coffee" which is coffee, butter and coconut oil, and it taste like toast, so its not bad, just unusual. Unusual like drinking something that taste like a steak. The taste triggers other senses and memory, so smooth liquid toast. Strange.
1266 2018-10-17 21:52:47 Saudi influence runs very deep in US foreign policy. Both sides of the relationship have enormous leverage (oil,security,commerce,power)- this is what makes the bond so strong. So strong that the US will turn a blind eye to such incidents.
1267 2018-10-17 21:52:45 Cheers Kevin !!! 
1268 2018-10-17 21:52:43 My love language: Don’t touch me— Unless you’re going to give me a full body massage with coconut oil.
1269 2018-10-17 21:52:37 @HamiltonMorris any recommendations on a tutorial for making THC oil from herb?
1270 2018-10-17 21:52:33 Yanks love oil far more than truth and justice.
1271 2018-10-17 21:52:33 They get canadian oil cheep
1272 2018-10-17 21:52:32 or to spell it right Corey Kluber.  Parents come up with these names so that they have no choice in life but to be a professional baseball player. Like Brock Holt and Oil Can Boyd.  Who names their kid Oil Can?
1273 2018-10-17 21:52:28 Because if you do both, then you own both and you make money from both. You can eventually wean off of oil. When the Saudis and OPEC own you and raise the price all the time it makes no sense. Times change. Wind and sun is free. Less pollution.
1274 2018-10-17 21:52:21 Strength that India showed to US and other countries by Iran oil and Russian missile system treaty. US can't do anything.

Nepal, Bhutan are like Indian public...Give them money and they will bote for anyone. Think before taking them as an example. 2/2

Gud Luck
1275 2018-10-17 21:52:05 Cheers bud will check it out. I'm trusting the book was made with oil based pulp and not water based?
1276 2018-10-17 21:51:59 trump wants his deals for buildings and golf clubs to stay in place and wants oil deals for the country. He has said over and over again that Mr. Jamal Khashoggi is not an American citizen so we know he doesn't care about him, his family or his @washingtonpost co-workers.
1277 2018-10-17 21:51:57 Why do you think care what you say, didn’t get enough money when you sold your shares in that corrupt oil company in America?
1278 2018-10-17 21:51:48 My skoda superb at your workshop since March 27, 2018 for a trouble of jerk while shifting gear liver from park to drive or reverse.  They opened ATF chamber with out my permission and no reasons to explain other than ATF oil consistency poor.  Still my car is with them
1279 2018-10-17 21:51:40 Oh n boycott products containing palm oil
1280 2018-10-17 21:51:34 Way to go Canadia! Im celebrating for u guys down here in Murray, KY with some MAJOR honey oil action while getting in a thorough bicep pump just in case Mr Tremblay has the stones to arm wrestle this 6ft 250lbs prior service US Marine who wants to take on Mr Muscle Milk himself!
1281 2018-10-17 21:51:29 With butter, MCT oil and a splash of heavy whipping cream. Yum 
1282 2018-10-17 21:51:26 Little bit of a slippery slope argument. The sponsorship is for the rating of eggs. If you drive a vehicle, travel by train, or even ride a bicycle then you obviously support female mutilation because Nigerian warlords will kill women for the oil. (See how my argument is similar)
1283 2018-10-17 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1284 2018-10-17 21:51:11 I use Oregamax, wild harvested wild oregano from North America herb and spice, plus a d3 elderberry defense by Natures Sunshine. Also used p73 oregano oil for years even in tiny diluted amounts for pet canary (pictured- my canary boy!) also Swiss "Sambu Guard
1285 2018-10-17 21:51:10 What do you mean preserved oil? There are reserves but not that much oh never mind
1286 2018-10-17 21:51:03 Mumu influencer, this is not Dangi underpass, you sold your okra brain to trend #GandunAiki yet you can't differentiate between a flyover and an underpass
1287 2018-10-17 21:50:30 Saudi Arabia sells oil in dollars, only if we sell oil in another currency such as the Chinese yuan, the Saudi riyal or the European currency, the dollar will become less valuable than the toilet paper.

America says it does not need Saudi Arabia
1288 2018-10-17 21:50:24 @carVertical_com Bought an 05 Audi S4 that looked too good to be true.
Low miles, all maintenance done..within 1 month it turned out that it was the worst decision I’ve ever made.. timing chain, new radiator, oil leaks.. the list goes on and on.. wish i had #carVertical back then
1289 2018-10-17 21:50:20 Thats what I'm running now homie.  Oil and balm.
1290 2018-10-17 21:50:16 When I get an oil change in my car it says “Oil life 100%” & can I just say that it makes me so happy for some reason. I swear it’s the little things in life.
1291 2018-10-17 21:50:10 Cough*, *Cough*. Why does this water taste funny? What's that weird smell? Why is this river so dirty? Did someone spill some oil over here?
1292 2018-10-17 21:50:00 It will go unanswered and Saudi Oil money too presious to the American Military industrial complex. #SadButTrue
1293 2018-10-17 21:49:52 That sounds nice! >: O
I know a lot of fancy peeps use olive oil but I haven't heard much sesame seed oil usage... I bet it tastes nice, I love me some sesame
1294 2018-10-17 21:49:36 Reason I ask is that by comparison do not Japan and China respectively hold USD$3 Trillion in Treasury Notes, in total about USD$6.7Tn.
Therefore fundamentally USA allows Saudi Arabia to have the presence it enjoys.
As oil diminishes in use/value what will Saudi Arabia influence?
1295 2018-10-17 21:49:32 But they are friends with the oil company tycoons. Why change to renewable fuel sources when they can keep dipping into our pocketbooks every darn day? This has been a battle since at least the 1970’s. But big business has alway prevailed. 
1296 2018-10-17 21:49:24 Frack up on the moors thats where they will find their gas and oil
1297 2018-10-17 21:49:22 They always kept control of their oil.
1298 2018-10-17 21:49:13 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

1299 2018-10-17 21:49:09 Glad you liked it, Amanda :) We have coded ocean plastics, dying corals reefs, oil spills, desertification, deforestation and biodiversity. Always trying to help students understand large, complex subjects.
1300 2018-10-17 21:49:00 Lol! Definition : Twats, plural, a group of like-minded people who pour away money in Nigerian oil companies.
1301 2018-10-17 21:48:56 It’s not about miles. It’s more about if money maintening gets to the point of a car note. You have a car with 300,000 miles that only needs an oil change and tire rotation and be good or a car with 50k miles and cost you 3000 a year to fix.
1302 2018-10-17 21:48:51 idk if it counts but apparently im pretty obsessed with sesame seed oil
1303 2018-10-17 21:48:44 A walnut kitchen island top with a built in and removable cutting board. The cutting board is end grain walnut with an oil finish. The top is 69” long X 32” deep, with a permanent low sheen clear coat.
1304 2018-10-17 21:48:35 *Cough*, *Cough*. Why does this water taste funny? What's that weird smell? Why is this river so dirty? Did someone spill some oil over here?
1305 2018-10-17 21:48:14 I legit talked to someone about how I’ve gone 100+ mi over before getting an oil change & today my engine was .2 from seizing up I legit checked my oil & it was as dry as the desert. And my car would not start. But we gucci. I changed the filter added oil n we are runnin clean
1306 2018-10-17 21:48:11 castor oil on your lashes every night before bed.
1307 2018-10-17 21:48:01 Saudi Arabia is innocent and there are no evidences, only fake stories.
Do you have or your sources, any evidences?
I am a Saudi and get all my rights.
For the suspension of arm supplies, we don't care, there are always alternatives
But, can the world live without Saudi Oil?!
1308 2018-10-17 21:47:58 Hear ya... I wasn't meaning to imply somebody planned to have oil wells pumping behind Beto...  Just making observations... and just so you know... I outgrew my tinfoil hat a couple of decades ago...
1309 2018-10-17 21:47:51 nah... but there's benefits behind using coconut oil as a lubricant for the female as well
1310 2018-10-17 21:47:45 We get a lot of oil from Canada.
1311 2018-10-17 21:47:41 I need an oil change and like 2 new tires
1312 2018-10-17 21:47:38 She’s better off using cbd oil which is already legal, as it has 0 thc in it, which is the depressant which makes you “high”. My mum uses the drops to help with her chronic pain caused by Fibromyalgia x
1313 2018-10-17 21:47:32 Can anyone chart Brent oil for me to see where it is in the channel ? Thanks
1314 2018-10-17 21:47:31 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
1315 2018-10-17 21:47:29 So them Dawisu paid anywhere belle face naija twitter influencers to trend #GandunAiki  all the trend's contain little or no meaningful tweets from those that have never stepped their foot in kano.
Moral of the story, you can pay twitter influencers to trend,but info is key
1316 2018-10-17 21:47:28 hate when it start gettin cold, i be powder white if i don’t use shea butter and oil
1317 2018-10-17 21:47:26 My skoda superb at your workshop since March 27, 2018 for a trouble of jerk while shifting gear liver from park to drive or reverse.  They opened ATF chamber with out my permission and no reasons to explain other than ATF oil consistency poor.  Skoda is cheating me. So negligent
1318 2018-10-17 21:47:23 Colostrum from Anotive, Fish oil, flaxseed oil CLA, B vitamins, Iron, low doses of Vit C, plant based protein, Fiji water or arrowhead, (heavily filtered water too acidic) #glutenfree #lactosefree no GMO's Kerrygold butter only.
1319 2018-10-17 21:47:23 Better get better terms with the US for protection if we are going push Navy and Air Force farther down the road. Probably better to buy Canadian oil from Canada than from Russia and OPEC. Just saying.
1320 2018-10-17 21:47:20 But the yeast needs to prove. It needs a medium to feed air to. The oil will kill the yeast. Batter flies from the fork. A very stuff batter if anything or a runny dough.
1321 2018-10-17 21:47:16 @Busisa74 I sent you a dm about cooking oil please respond asap thanks
1322 2018-10-17 21:47:13 #BaconMayo - 2 egg yolks, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp white wine vinegar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, 1/2 cup neutral oil (safflower for ex), 2 tbps bacon fat. Blend with stick blender until emulsified. Serve on #BLT. Or anything.

You're welcome.
1323 2018-10-17 21:47:06 Well, the 3 people mentioned are completely irrelevant and the sovereign nation mentioned has us over the 'oil' barrel.  Other than that,  i can't really think of why @realDonaldTrump whould do that.
1324 2018-10-17 21:47:01 But the Republican Base who have notoriously referred to Saudis as "towel heads" since 911 have been turned by Donald into Pickup driving oil devouring "Patriots"!
1325 2018-10-17 21:46:44 Yes but the rollbacks in EPA regulations means everyone within zone of an oil field or gas plant now have to worry about leakage into the water table. Look at Eastern Kentucky whose water smells like diesel. A case of water should be sent to Trump, to enjoy in the Whitehouse.
1326 2018-10-17 21:46:35 With a stream of frying oil at temperature every 15 or 20 ft so he gets deep fried to death.
1327 2018-10-17 21:46:35 Ive been using coconut oil the past hour and my eyes gonna burn off
1328 2018-10-17 21:46:29 The actual cited studies are worth a read. 1)they are all based on rats that 2)have been starved for a long time and then allowed to binge on sugar solution, after which they 3)show signs of withdrawal.

Is this how people consume sugar? Note lab-chow to corn oil also does this.
1329 2018-10-17 21:46:25 Maybe. I know we think of barrels of oil, and maybe he was thinking that. The tank he was in was huge though, hardly a barrel.
1330 2018-10-17 21:46:16 Lavender oil on my pillows 
1331 2018-10-17 21:46:14 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1332 2018-10-17 21:46:09 I keep thinking my Rosehip Oil is going to leak so I put the contact case in a plastic bag JIC, but knock on wood so far it hasn't. IDK if it would work for toner, though, because sometimes my actual contact solution leaks, but oil cleanser should be okay, I'd think. Good luck!
1333 2018-10-17 21:46:04 これは何度も言っていることだけれどひぷくんには是非ともTDDのCDを出して欲しい
1334 2018-10-17 21:46:01 Hmm a realist I kinda doubt that realist would not join a facist military to go kill innocent people for oil and drugs nah you're a puppet
1335 2018-10-17 21:45:38 Oil States $OIS Sees Q3 Revenue at Low End of Guided Range
1336 2018-10-17 21:45:34 Yeah but did you see all that Saudi Arabian oil holding every little hair in place?
1337 2018-10-17 21:45:32 Omelette with truffle olive oil, asparagus and smoke Salmon .... fit for a king....
1338 2018-10-17 21:45:32 Seriously happens to me every time. I paid $90 last time I went to the oil change place. Now I make Dad take mine 
1339 2018-10-17 21:45:22 *Cough*, *Cough*. Why does this water taste funny? What's that weird smell? Why is this river so dirty? Did someone spill some oil over here?
1340 2018-10-17 21:45:05 So the only thing that I have been doing at night is oil cleansing  but I feel like I should be doing more
1341 2018-10-17 21:45:00 No one is saying it will bring back the money but it will definitely get Nigeria justice. Our commonwealth was glaringly looted. Funds from our biggest ever oil field stashed in private pockets is ridiculously an assault on the Nigerian state.
1342 2018-10-17 21:44:59 My go to when I start feeling sick is oil of oregano. Tastes awful unless you get it in pill form. It works for me
1343 2018-10-17 21:44:56 Have had same.
Was a hose in the center tube with a pinhole. Center tube has ends welded partially closed. Took A LOT of testing until the oil filled the bottom of that tube and started running out!
1344 2018-10-17 21:44:48 @ShepNewsTeam Again, stop claiming the Shlep show is news cuz it is not, It’s an opinion show! He talks about issues and reaches his own conclusions all the time, that’s opinion not news! We cover up for Saudi Arabia because of the oil under sand, opinion!!!
1345 2018-10-17 21:44:48 As an Oilman I cannot support Beto. He wants to punish the Texas oil industry which is bad for Texas. If Texas were a country we would be the 4th biggest oil producer in the World. It’s the greatest story of the 21st century and Beto wants to punish us. He is bad for Texas!
1346 2018-10-17 21:44:48 My secret to soft glowing skin in the winters is. Right after I get out the shower I put coconut oil on my body with out drying my body. Then I dry myself off and put on lotion that either has coconut oil or butter in it and boom soft glowing non ashy skin all winter long.

1349 2018-10-17 21:44:32 Beto is NOT for Texas 
Don’t let his commercials trick you 
 Our Oil & Gas workers jobs depend on it
1350 2018-10-17 21:44:23 "could.
but thanks to us and our friends BP, Total and Exxon, it won't, and oil will continue to destroy the world"
1351 2018-10-17 21:44:15 Ripe boli with palm oil garnished with salt ....
1352 2018-10-17 21:44:13 You can’t use organic solvents to make oil... but this is just a safety issue.
1353 2018-10-17 21:44:07 Basil always hits you with 
"alright and did you want a tire change with that?"
nah fam just change my oil
1354 2018-10-17 21:44:06 I know why god isn’t blessing me , three years ago I chased a shot of Jameson with holy oil  lord forgive me
1355 2018-10-17 21:44:05 If there were constant supplies who would they sell to.  They trying to feed their families by buying and selling this oil.  That's in a way what pnp borrowdale does.They buy cheap put a mark up and sell to you kudzi.kkkk no big difference save for tax
1356 2018-10-17 21:44:01 Conduct your own investigation 

Oh thats right, dont want to spoil your sweet oil deals. Got a thorn out your side too...
1357 2018-10-17 21:43:49 Trudeau will not ban the purchase of Saudi oil in Canada. He is paper wimp and will fold if the Saudis tell him to.
1358 2018-10-17 21:43:46 Its the migraine getting you nauseous. Damn try to get a hold of some CBD oil drops to take. Ive taken it and it helps also.
1359 2018-10-17 21:43:45 Exactly.  Its all about who gets the pot of gold first . Glover are off as money is at stake . You would think our trade would have learned after seeing gas and oil take the urine
1360 2018-10-17 21:43:43 i just figured out my oil light is my oil light 3 days ago
1361 2018-10-17 21:43:41 Palm oil?
1362 2018-10-17 21:43:39 thank you!! I bought the actual oil!! :)
1363 2018-10-17 21:43:37 When you go in to get an oil change and a belt adjustment...and then they say you need both your belts replaced...oh and $200 for another part/additional labor...oh and we broke some pieces fixing that piece so that's another $180...oof...
1364 2018-10-17 21:43:16 I row with some smart people on here, since myself and Kate have tried the CBD oil one of them is saying we are on spice and are druggies hahahahahahahahaha
1365 2018-10-17 21:43:13 Lube and oil change and they are good to go out again.
1366 2018-10-17 21:43:12 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1367 2018-10-17 21:43:06 US is now #1 oil producer anyway, situation would be different if we were still dependent on Saudi oil
1368 2018-10-17 21:42:49 It makes me sick that the west continues to kowtow to Saudi Arabia. Canada, of all countries, should not need their blood tainted oil. Time to build #energyeast, & work with the US to increase our refining capabilities, our export opportunities & become energy independent.
1369 2018-10-17 21:42:47 It's all a game.  We can be independent of world sources of oil without politics involved.
1370 2018-10-17 21:42:38 Might be burning the midnight oil to try & finalize the $ACB uplist. 
1371 2018-10-17 21:42:35 oil is the best way to keep the good taste of your pasta, if you add butter it'll ruin it even if it's not disgusting at all
1372 2018-10-17 21:42:28 I Wonder if there are any countries in say South America that have oil they could sell to the U S
1373 2018-10-17 21:42:15 I've decided to go full steam ahead on The Winter Beardening (aka, at least a full level above the #DadBeard), so it looks like I'm finally gonna have to invest in some beard oil.
1374 2018-10-17 21:42:13 U just need tea tree oil
1375 2018-10-17 21:42:10 I’m not saying that is your problem, maybe if we were full of oil it would be your problem.
1376 2018-10-17 21:42:07 You put any heat on it? Sounds like you absolutely need some and either peppermint oil or straight Icy Hott, Tiger Balm
1377 2018-10-17 21:42:06 Coal died in colfax county way before Obama. Resource extraction is a dead end, limited. Need to push more renewables, not oil and coal!
1378 2018-10-17 21:41:57 Time to work some discount magic at the oil change place 
1379 2018-10-17 21:41:49 @Syrenz14 Hi love they are so many forms of homemade cleansers for makeup brushes but the one that I love the most is Dish soap (if its for sensitive skin, better) with olive oil. I usually add a little of some othe essential oils into the mix like rose essence. -Eli
1380 2018-10-17 21:41:47 Anyone in midland going to the oil show?
1381 2018-10-17 21:41:46 (At work)

Robert DeViro: Are you the guy from RTR?

1382 2018-10-17 21:41:34 Oil war!!!!
1383 2018-10-17 21:41:26 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
1384 2018-10-17 21:41:21 Which is it?  

The U.S. is the leading producer of oil and the leading oil supplier to the world and completely independent from outside sources of oil as @realDonaldTrump boasts, 

or that is a lie and we don't have enough oil to run our country?
1385 2018-10-17 21:41:21 Getting my oil changed in CS & giving my information (phone number) & the guy says “whatchu know about that 903??” 
“Can’t you tell what I know by the way I talk?” 
Having the same accent is me: “I grew in Longview. Hi neighbor” 
Lololol gawd.
1386 2018-10-17 21:41:18 @realDonaldTrump oil company shell and walmart are involved in hate crimes. Why wont you stop this terror on Americans?
1387 2018-10-17 21:41:16 @BBCJonSopel @bbcfeedback 
report fm North Dakota - no mention of long confrontation btwn First Nation people & US oil industry. Why not? Very poor report! Why no report from DAPL over last few years? Get real.
1388 2018-10-17 21:41:02 FFS people. Stop being so flaming insular. 

Renewable green energy works. Look at Scandinavia. Even Norway. They're investing their national oil profits in clean renewable energy research & deployment. Wind. Water. Thermal energy.
1389 2018-10-17 21:41:01 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1390 2018-10-17 21:41:00 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1391 2018-10-17 21:40:59 I made the mistake of starting Salt Fat Acid Heat on Netflix. I say mistake because now I'm terribly homesick for Italy and would give my right hand for the taste of fresh olive oil on pasta under the Italian sun.
1392 2018-10-17 21:40:54 I was also told this week that due to electric cars, Scottish Oil was now a dead commodity which makes me wonder why England is prepared to risk soil, air and water security along with earthquakes to Frack for oil & gas? And where are these electric aeroplanes?
1393 2018-10-17 21:40:42 Same here. CBD oil is great for aches and pains. They even make a mild sedative for dogs that’s much safer than from the vet.
1394 2018-10-17 21:40:40 This is why we need to cure our addiction to oil. Because if fuel goes to $5 a litre I won't be able to afford to drive.
1395 2018-10-17 21:40:38 Hi Peter. Your pizza with caramelized onions and motor oil will be delivered in 9 min via rocket.
1396 2018-10-17 21:40:37 We could also stop buying their oil.
1397 2018-10-17 21:40:31 Is the sign on property you want to turn over to developers or oil companies?
1398 2018-10-17 21:40:28 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
1399 2018-10-17 21:40:26 We DO NOT need the Saudi oil. We do not need the House of Saud.

1402 2018-10-17 21:40:17 Just doing a skin-pampering rose oil treatment, partner tried to hug me and I shot 30 feet in the air...

1405 2018-10-17 21:40:05 Got an oil change and some other stuff done in 10/15mins. And got a discount 
1406 2018-10-17 21:40:03 Awwww this is very lovely. I hate not sampling those orange oil chocolates anymore P!
1407 2018-10-17 21:40:01 everybody knows that when the President opens his mouth, Mitch Mcconnell subscibes to the #NYT
1408 2018-10-17 21:39:55 When you pass a gas station and the smell of cooking oil is stronger than the smell of motor oil, you might just live in #Evansville. 
#friedchicken
1409 2018-10-17 21:39:52 There an orchestrated attach by shorts and big oil to stop the spread of EVs and attack @elonmusk personally. Obviously Saudis tried to control $TSLA but Elon was too smart. Death of journalist is too coincidental also because he knew something about Trump being involved.
1410 2018-10-17 21:39:50 That's great for France and I'm in favor of pursuing this path for all countries, just not without also reigning in the oil companies that are undermining such progress.

Also, countries that reduce their emissions are often just offshoring their pollution elsewhere.

1412 2018-10-17 21:39:39 I live an hour and a half north of Toronto for a reason.
 
Calgary's nice but you end up riding the oil Market out there.
 
Vancouver's just bloody expensive but freaking gorgeous.
 
Toronto never stops to its positive and negative. With traffic comparable to large u.s. cities.

1414 2018-10-17 21:39:25 I ain't got the time for this. I've just popped some lavender oil onto those boils on my chest and ticking myself in now
1415 2018-10-17 21:39:20 Well, that’s a quite a stretch, since he basically has everything he’s wanted already...shallow at best, look at the environment of your comment, and then tell me how many in the left have oil in their portfolios.

1417 2018-10-17 21:39:09 Wanna know how adult I am? Today I went and got my oil changed... without parental supervision 
1418 2018-10-17 21:39:08 so we should retreat when we see blatant acts of state sponsored murder?    Since WE are now the largest producer of oil...we could cut all oil ties with them...or should we just become of country of snowflakes?
1419 2018-10-17 21:38:52 Extra irl work stuff tonight. Nothing fun. Only job responsibilities can keep me from you all. Send some love as I burn the afternoon oil, I will see you all tomorrow for streaming games!
1420 2018-10-17 21:38:51 Very sad.. who is next oil is rising. Hope it’s not Norwegian but I guess that depends on how big the investors pockets are.
1421 2018-10-17 21:38:38 The great thing about him is that he's 57 but looks about 30.

1422 2018-10-17 21:38:27 I got home and changed out of my greasy, oil stained work uniform into my comfortable evening clothes. When I came down, the wife looks me over and says "you make Bob Dylan look like Tim Gunn."

Damn. That is an awesome line.
1423 2018-10-17 21:38:24 Look into cbd oil and golden paste
1424 2018-10-17 21:38:21 I kind of suspect you guys are financially profiting from Big Oil or Big Auto or something like that
1425 2018-10-17 21:38:19 Our food is great.

It's the other stuff I'm complaining about.

When I was in Italy I really did enjoy the pasta, oil seemed more popular than butter, the gelato was amazing, but I did miss the ice in my drink.
1426 2018-10-17 21:38:07 Why? To stop giving these oil coorperations more money
1427 2018-10-17 21:38:06 Is $100 million the price for murder? How about @realDonaldTrump drop 3 nukes on their big cities, and take their oil. It seems that's the biggest reason for maintaining ties with them.

1429 2018-10-17 21:38:00 I'm about seven hours late but something I recently discovered is that getting the oil smoking hot and then pouring the eggs mixture (which has already been mixed in a bowl) in there makes it so the eggs cook quick, and nothing really sticks. 1/2

1446 2018-10-17 21:36:03 That’s true, unless, wait, he makes the single biggest investment in clean energy in history, but you’re probably right that had nothing to do the oil prices plummeting in 2015! 
1447 2018-10-17 21:35:57 If I had the highest quality CBD oil available for purchase, would you be interested?

1455 2018-10-17 21:35:12 The main difference between Maduro and Chávez, beyond the charm whom he shares with Trump, is the price of the barrel of oil. I am sorry to say, but you are as irresponsible as your current president. BARF.
1456 2018-10-17 21:34:59 My Lord Missy have you tried essential oil’s that’s been working pretty well for me I mix 2 drops of peppermint with frankincense and rub it on my four head and near my temples in a little bit on my chest. Most of the time it helps quite well!
1457 2018-10-17 21:34:57 It’s the oil stupid!
1458 2018-10-17 21:34:53 Isn't this also bullish for miners since oil is a major input cost?

1474 2018-10-17 21:33:21 We literally act like we police the world when it benefits us (oil). The best way to keep people from coming here is to help them stay where they are. You know who is helping decrease illegal immigration? Nabisco & Carrier. Jason is correct. This attitude we have makes it worse.
1475 2018-10-17 21:33:20 I love my new job, but i hate life after cause i get to go home covered in oil, blisters, and my hair looks like it hasnt been washed in days when i just showered last night.
1476 2018-10-17 21:33:16 Fuck the #Saudis
They are the source of so much misery on this planet.The leaders in the west only tolerate these bastards because of cheap oil. Which is also destroying our environment. Fuck them.
In a way I am happy because they are finally being exposed for their barbaric ways
1477 2018-10-17 21:33:04 That sounds good af but I need an oil change, badly 
1478 2018-10-17 21:33:01 The real reason girls don’t get their oil changed is the harassment that comes with going to the mechanics and that’s the tea

1489 2018-10-17 21:31:43 If corn oil is made of corn , coconut oil made of coconut . Then what is baby oil made of ? 
1490 2018-10-17 21:31:36 Now that we know it’s not a Black swan event, there are any number ways a visitor could be killed in a KSA Embassy. From a medical butcher to guillotines to electric chairs. Oil, specially when it’s prices are high, can buy many ways to eliminate visitors the KSA doesn’t like.
1491 2018-10-17 21:31:35 Add his reckless Iran policy, which depends crucially on more Saudi oil.
1492 2018-10-17 21:31:30 The rate at which APC digging ATIKU the past they will soon discover Crude Oil..

1494 2018-10-17 21:31:26 Subsiding cooking oil, fuel, bread, pharmacies, packaging (beer, water, etc) is a battle one cannot win.

Queues for these will surely get worse. Scarce FX resources are being  wasted 4 no benefit. 

When shall we surely learn as a country? We did it b4 & it never worked.
1495 2018-10-17 21:31:26 Yep, nothing says "This is Oil Country!" like a replica of a big, generic, overpriced bridge!  #LetsGoOilers
1496 2018-10-17 21:31:24 Not gospel.   Source of opposition is well funded propaganda by natural gas/oil.    Nuclear can replace gas market share.  Gas funds pro wind/solar propaganda and "green" NGOs with same message because wind/solar are just expensive ways to burn more gas.   No CO2 reductions wind.
1497 2018-10-17 21:31:21 How? They can't make their own weapons, they're dependent on the West for security, etc. Iran is a completely  different story. The worst the Saudis can do is mess with either the oil supply or the petrodollar. Right now, if they do either of these things happens, it'll tank...
1498 2018-10-17 21:31:21 The CBD oil wore off and now I’m a big ball of anxiety FML.
1499 2018-10-17 21:31:18 This transcends party politics. It’s cool/easy to just label the Tories as evil, but it’s pointless. The UK and the world needs Saudi oil, and as long as we do we will fund them and they will continue to act the way they do. It’s a shitty world.
1500 2018-10-17 21:31:18 Please come over and lovingly cornrow my hair and oil my scalp while we watch Girlfriends reruns on youtube and laugh to death about how I am Lynn and I actually got a degree in anthro? #lovebeingblack #iwokeuplikethis #PNWsowhite #anthrosowhite #girlfriends #blackisbeautiful

1503 2018-10-17 21:31:05 if you know what coolant mixed with oil looks like yeaaa now picture that all over me 
1504 2018-10-17 21:31:01 It's also a hell of a lot closer to the oil and gas that creates our power, than the majority of the 
1505 2018-10-17 21:30:57 it is beyond disgusting that dealing with a country like Saudi Arabia who can turn off the oil spigots and raise gasoline to about $7 a gallon here @POTUS @HouseGOP @SenateGOP

1520 2018-10-17 21:29:55 You just said the lobby cares about jobs. Implying the other side doesn’t. No job means no money. It will go bust in Colorado yes if you actually read 112. It’s created to eliminate oil and gas altogether.
1521 2018-10-17 21:29:50 U like to drink oil abi?
1522 2018-10-17 21:29:42 @DaveRamsey Thanks to you Dave my emergency fund came in handy as I found out I needed new brakes while getting my oil changed. #anemergencybecameaninconvenience
1523 2018-10-17 21:29:41 Oil and Vaseline. It’s weird, but oil conditions the leather and Vaseline keeps it soft from what I’m told. I’m no expert, but worked on my glove ha.
1524 2018-10-17 21:29:40 Don’t give me that fake ass far left pole shit!! Facts!! Look at oil prices, if you ever want to know how the economy is doing look at oil prices. Oil makes and breaks us all!
1525 2018-10-17 21:29:36 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1526 2018-10-17 21:29:32 He's the most vile hypocrite on the planet. When he felt his personal oil interests in Venezuela were threatened, he was on air literally calling for the assassination of the Venezuelan president. He's good with killing his opposition. He is WHY I'd never call myself "Christian".

1529 2018-10-17 21:29:12 What? Did they buy him a coconut oil plantation?
1530 2018-10-17 21:28:52 Anything to try and make himself look better. He's a snake oil salesman, and not even a good one at that. Premier Chaos should stick to his job and keep his nose out of Federal Justice decisions. Stick to your own lane Doug.

1535 2018-10-17 21:28:04 Fake News present. Every time someone mentions yo Führer Trump, the need to sanction the Saudi criminal monarchy. The president shed tears of oil.
1536 2018-10-17 21:27:56 I understand how it works. No itchy backs in The Conservative party or the Saudi government. I'm sorry but I can't see how we can justify the murder of so many innocent people because it's convenient when it comes to buying oil. There has to be another way of doing business.

1544 2018-10-17 21:26:50 Add Lions and Tigers (Bengali, Cincinnati) to that and you win some kind of football trifecta. Back out if you see ragged clothes and straw. Whatever you do, do not pick up an isolated oil can. It's primed as some kind of strange click bait.
1545 2018-10-17 21:26:50 one  good    reason  Saudis  hate  Iran,  Iran is a  huge huge  country,  the only one  that  wasn't  colonised by  Europeans, Plus  it  does  have  an  ancient  culture  hell..  the  PERSIANS  INVENTED    EMPIRE  BUILDING.

1552 2018-10-17 21:26:12 I totally get it but it's the essence of clutter maybe? I have 2 boxes of spices next to the house of oil, salt & pepper.

1559 2018-10-17 21:25:47 The oil market is a mess of Trump's own making, too. I understand why the White House would be worried. Perhaps, they should consider bringing on people who have extensive experience in Middle East relations, esp. crises, to develop informed, coordinated strategies going forward.
1560 2018-10-17 21:25:35 George come on.  The main thing the remain side went on about during the independence red was we’d be turfed out of Europe if we went on our own.  They UK government have robbed us for years of our oil revenue and now drag us out of Europe.

1573 2018-10-17 21:23:58 No, it's logical. Current Russian regime benefits far more from the far-right side of the horseshoe, esp. since Russia makes Kalashnikov assault rifles and can only effect its international diplomacy/oil strategy via bribery and corruption.

That social friction is a natural part of people interacting at scale and develops societal lubricant. Different societies need different oil weights, to continue the analogy.

1602 2018-10-17 21:20:21 This is true... medical patients don't play by the recreational rule book. Many people with a variety of ailments need true weed oil medicine with HiGH CBD to function. I've never smelled it, but I'm sure it isn't that different.

1616 2018-10-17 21:19:24 Because Saudi Arabia can cause the price of oil to rise to $120 ahead of a tough midterm election.
1617 2018-10-17 21:19:19 The money Saudia Arabia has and the influence with oil could cause us to be low on the list and have many countries come after us through requests just not because they ask but N.Korea, Russia, China are not our allies..Trump is to much of an idiot to see he has been used.
1618 2018-10-17 21:19:16 You appeared to have failed to highlight the raping of Scotlands oil wealth by Westminster

1620 2018-10-17 21:19:02 That's simply not true. It's a myth propagated by people like Cato.

Standard Oil -- which was actually the CAUSE of some of our antitrust laws -- is a great example.

It became a strong virtual monopoly without the aid of government collusion.
1621 2018-10-17 21:18:59 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
1622 2018-10-17 21:18:56 I am living proof of what will happen if we dont  approve 112. The oil industry is literally trying to drill under my house and under the local elementary school. They are trying to get it approved quickly in case 112 passes.
1623 2018-10-17 21:18:50 I used to get hours long rolling acid attacks from pizza, spaghetti, & brown liquors. Oregano oil has been the most helpful in stopping them. I have to take 450 mgs of Puritans Pride brand but the last bottle I had I only needed 1 pill  (not 3). Ymmv
1624 2018-10-17 21:18:46 which set is it precisely?
1625 2018-10-17 21:18:35 I’ve found that oil has greatly reduced all my anxiety, I used to still have a decent amount of anxiety even when daily-using flower but oil has worked wonders
1626 2018-10-17 21:18:26 "The Saudis can take their oil & shove it. Human rights aren't for sale" - Congressman Denny Heck. @RepDennyHeck
I love this guy!! 

He's also on the House Intelligence Committee. 

Here's to the #BlueInitiative so the HIC can reopen the Russia Investigation.
1627 2018-10-17 21:18:21 Scheduled my car for an oil change, paid some bills. #ADULTING
1628 2018-10-17 21:18:21 Same but I made the mistake of making my first 2 with nothing in the skillet and it was a hot mess! I added oil to “fry” them and it was sooooo much better lol
1629 2018-10-17 21:18:20 Psalm 23: 5. You make ready a table for me in front of my haters: you put oil on my head; my cup is overflowing. - Bible Offline
1630 2018-10-17 21:18:17 Mental health is a serious illness and our veterans deserve a serious treatment.  Hellers experimental treatment sounds a bit like a snake oil salesman to me.  Just like his boss. Anything for money
1631 2018-10-17 21:18:13 A woman in my classroom just pulled out a little oil diffuser shaped like a teddy bear and plugged it into her cell phone to provide aromatherapy for the class. I have now seen everything.
1632 2018-10-17 21:18:13 I need someone who is *not* a blogger to tell me if CBD oil actually works!
1633 2018-10-17 21:18:06 No IQ, just oil
1634 2018-10-17 21:18:05 For the same reason Saudi Arabia got off scot free from 9/11 even though all of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudi.  Oil matters more than 3000 American lives and one dead journalist.  Sad. Really. Sad.
1635 2018-10-17 21:18:01 I detest those ads. They are snake oil on steroids.
1636 2018-10-17 21:17:56 "You can take your oil and shove it because human rights are not for sale." Denny @RepDennyHeck  I love him.
1637 2018-10-17 21:17:48 DAMN RIGHT
Rep Denny Heck says on @CNN the #Saudis can take their OIL and shove it.... #America cannot sell out #HumanRights for OIL
1638 2018-10-17 21:17:19 I ate some raisins but forgot I had peppermint oil on my hands and now my throat stings
1639 2018-10-17 21:17:17 @RepDennyHeck I like what you said regarding the Saudis “no oil over civility”!
1640 2018-10-17 21:17:15 The new normal in the GOP:
1) Despots with oil are more important than the lives of Journalists
2) It isn't Rape if she doesn't scream.
3) Grandma is to blame for our Debt.
4) Rising sea levels and a  hotter world is ok.
5) Women don't want equal wages.
1641 2018-10-17 21:17:14 Honestly, dont you think the oil could get a decent 5 dman if they offered their own 2nd or 3rd rounder?
1642 2018-10-17 21:17:09 #ukog seems like swampy is spread a bit thin on the ground. What with the Weald gushing oil from different sites and fracking at Preston all at the same time . The 20 or so that pretend they are locals at all these sites can't be in several places  at the same time.
1643 2018-10-17 21:17:06 Roast veggies tossed in olive oil or avocado oil (I add Trader Joe’s roasted garlic sea salt for flavor)... mmmmm!
1644 2018-10-17 21:16:47 That is what it was created for, but not what it does now. It is a mercenary force used by corporations to protect or steal other counties resources. We are an oil company with an army.
1645 2018-10-17 21:16:36 It's saturated fat and oil!!!
1646 2018-10-17 21:16:36 Kylie: no oil consumption with Motul 15W60 offroad. Tested it myself.

1648 2018-10-17 21:16:18 Do you have a Pier One, they  have the best room defusers, I think that's what they are called, the sticks you put in the oil...lol
1649 2018-10-17 21:16:14 We know where our food and clothes come from. What if we could see the sources of our oil and gas?
1650 2018-10-17 21:16:11 That’s not how oil prices work! They are going up because of the Iran deal you scrapped along with other market pressures
1651 2018-10-17 21:15:55 All of the tunnels in Gaza are connected just like oil piplelines on under water or on soil how do you think fighters from egypt get to the west bank ? How do you think fighters get to Iran, syria & lebanon for training ? How do you think leaders in Gaza get out of Gaza
1652 2018-10-17 21:15:37 Beto wants to shut down the oil in the industry in the United States so we become more dependent on Venezuela!!!
1653 2018-10-17 21:15:35 We don't sell our oil. We are actually giving it away and subsidizing the US. Canada sells 1 barrel of oil for about $24 to the USA. From that 1 barrel, Canada buys back from the USA 20 gallons of gasoline and 11 gallons diesel at a cost of $150.47.
1654 2018-10-17 21:15:34 Sativas can give me anxiety sometimes, and I definitely find oil to be less anxiety inducing
1655 2018-10-17 21:15:28 I found these little cubes of frozen crushed garlic in olive oil (which I'm sure I could make) and dropping those into a hot soup is a godsend. 10/10
1656 2018-10-17 21:15:27 APC online herdsmen keep shouting, PMB don't have Oil Bloc, PMB don't have Oil Bloc,
But PMB gave his daughter to the son of Oil Bloc Owner, 
We can now say PMB is Oil Bloc Owner by default
1657 2018-10-17 21:15:27 Here's a solution: Bill Self (and the other snake oil salesmen) could just not cheat.  
Instead of going to dinner with Gassanola and engaging this street pimp in your recruiting tell him to go pound sand and stay the hell away from your program.
1658 2018-10-17 21:15:23 Here they are!  Oil slick hair, and the surgically altered homewrecker.
1659 2018-10-17 21:15:20 Trump knows the Saudi’s did it but Oil runs the world so hey .
1660 2018-10-17 21:15:18 What essential oil do you use to get a wife?
1661 2018-10-17 21:15:14 Somebody make some weed oil gimme nuh!
1662 2018-10-17 21:15:13 5 coaches. I think that if you aren't willing to have a discourse with 5 coaches, then that's on you. I think that speaks to Hall's immaturity at the time. I also think that if the truth were known, it might be a part of why Chia was willing to do the trade
1663 2018-10-17 21:15:12 egg, green onion, some teriyaki sauce and chili oil
1664 2018-10-17 21:15:12 Lakes & streams in MN01 found to be polluted - @JimHagedorn response: "...too many regulations." Also wants to repeal and replace ACA - has not offered anything to replace it with. Would push for more pipelines, refineries and crude oil drilling on U.S. soil. No thanks.
1665 2018-10-17 21:15:05 That says to the Middle East, you can Kill Americans , just pay up with your oil money. Sad.
1666 2018-10-17 21:14:43 Cuz this days no more oil weapons..
Oil now every where..
1667 2018-10-17 21:14:31 Whenever millions of naira go or went into oil exploration, no one cries if oil is not found after all.
There's no crime in trying to achieve something great.
1668 2018-10-17 21:14:28 Saudis royals can't make much of what you write, so chances of them sending a squad for you is zero. 
Until the time Saudis buy US weapons and act as a balance to iran and pump 10m barrel oil per day, no US admin can call credible action.
1669 2018-10-17 21:14:26 Oh cool. I just learned all about CBD Oil? It won't help everyone, but is a great alternative treatment to try. Have you tried that? - Jena
1670 2018-10-17 21:14:16 The fundamental point is that the UK is complicit because we buy their oil. Cars, chemical industries, medical equipment etc. Is all possible because of Saudi oil. If we stopped selling them bombs, it might make us feel good, but nothing would change on the ground.
1671 2018-10-17 21:13:59 Oil oil oil......thats why he will not abandon Riyadh
1672 2018-10-17 21:13:50 Oil for the global economy and counterweight against Russia/Iran.
1673 2018-10-17 21:13:49 Potatoes, something about a baked potato or pan fried potatoes in a little oil, buttor or if I was really doing bad Crisco.  Salt pepper and maybe a can of corn and a frozen bag of broccoli mixed in and 3 bucks worth of food for 6 meals.
1674 2018-10-17 21:13:46 Permanent Oil job

Why would he leave?
1675 2018-10-17 21:13:39 If you knew the things I’ve had to explain to people under 30 you’d be amazed. Currents, butterflies, why we need bees, why you need to pay attention to the oil light in your car. WE ARE DOOMED.
1676 2018-10-17 21:13:36 And I’m sure you’re an absolute oil painting.
1677 2018-10-17 21:13:30 Bought both books, on the website weekly, and have decided to become WFPB - one week sober. I have partially convinced my mom to take a 30-day challenge with me; she has congest heart failure - bacon sandwiches, eggs ,cream in her coffee, and loves her olive oil and salt!
1678 2018-10-17 21:13:29 :] i am :] making some :] eggs with jam:] and some hot oil :] jumped :] in :] my :] f a c e :]
1679 2018-10-17 21:13:28 Gee, now it seems like enough alternative fuels would be good. We could be selling that technology and telling the Saudis to drink their oil.
1680 2018-10-17 21:13:27 Well, indirectly, my statement was intended to do both because, Americans of all incomes fail to realize that regulations act as a “governor” to use a trucking term on progress — not too much and not too little. For argument sake I disagree with some regs on oil; imports r 2 high
1681 2018-10-17 21:13:19 When are voters gonna stop believing this tired old GOP snake oil about tax cuts? It’s Lucy and the football every time, and all the Charlie Brown’s believing that she’s not really gonna pull the ball away again. Apparently never....
1682 2018-10-17 21:13:18 Oregano oil caplets for future attacks but yeah sounds like u should get checked out
1683 2018-10-17 21:13:17 Nicole is a  audio and video equipment technician that likes Sesame oil on their artichoke pizza with vodka
1684 2018-10-17 21:13:10 Join us for tonight’s specials!!

Fish: Poached halibut and tiger shrimp pot pie!!   

Vegan: Autumn vegan shepherds pie with sweet potato parsnip mash, sage oil & crispy fried sage.   

Risotto: Roasted baby carrots, cipollini onions, and arugula. 
1685 2018-10-17 21:12:41 Money, oil and Middle East influence overrides principles. I guess that’s why 9/11 & Saudi links were never investigated publicly, despite several of the terrorists being Saudi citizens. I wonder how many celebs, entertainers & CEOs will put principle ahead of money? 
1686 2018-10-17 21:12:32 I like the sentiment of just cheering for who we have 
1687 2018-10-17 21:12:19 Did you know that CBD oil is already legally available in Utah? Helps people with seizures, pain, nausea and headaches WITHOUT prescription, OTC.
1688 2018-10-17 21:12:15 With the excess oil that can be used to make another pot of stew???? I bet I'm not the only one.
1689 2018-10-17 21:12:12 you mean because I changed all of the ingredients? 

Look, I just made cookies, but used all coconut oil instead of flour and lemon zest instead of sugar. WHY DIDN'T MY COOKIES TURN OUT GOOD?! 1 Star!
1690 2018-10-17 21:12:11 I understand the urgency to become a contender given how good 97 is, but once again, we forget just how bad Oil were. It was a big hole to dig out of. I'm willing to be a little more patient based on the situation. If NEXT season goes awry, then I'll be on board with a GM change
1691 2018-10-17 21:12:08 Think we gone buss owt the MZ GOLD oil this weekend 
1692 2018-10-17 21:12:08 Oh right, because you have no need for reality
1693 2018-10-17 21:12:05 @econet_support do something about my money ...I want my money back ...but for the why ....fuel yonetsa ..cooking oil yonetsa neEconet Data ronetsa
1694 2018-10-17 21:12:01 We must abandon the demonic culture driven by greed or there will be nobody left to screw over. The Saudis are just about out of oil anyway. The simple solution is to purchase (not steal) Iranian oil!
1695 2018-10-17 21:12:00 Wish I knew the formulation of this mixture my grandmother used to make, involving olive oil, egg yolk, and some nice-smelling thing. She used to slather it all over herself and had an excellent complexion.
1696 2018-10-17 21:11:58 Amazing what oil money can buy, isn't it?
1697 2018-10-17 21:11:54 I make my own mayo. Oil, soy milk and just a dribble of vinegar. I can’t tell the difference from egg mayo.
1698 2018-10-17 21:11:51 He's a dottering old overpaid Snake Oil salesman.
1699 2018-10-17 21:11:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
1700 2018-10-17 21:11:37 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
1701 2018-10-17 21:11:30 I walk every day, 30 min. minimum.
I also take fish oil.
1702 2018-10-17 21:11:30 We sell them weapons so they can continue 2 bomb innocent Yemeni civilians (we been helping them w refueling of jets & finding the targets. We also been selling them weapons for decades.) & in return, we buy their oil.
1703 2018-10-17 21:11:28 In the UK we have legalised CBD oil so hopefully smoking will not too far away. I have chronic auto immune disease and would welcome it 
1704 2018-10-17 21:11:23 Currently calling cbd oil to the rescue because.... this heffa
1705 2018-10-17 21:11:17 if i was a cooking oil i'd be extra virgin olive oil
1706 2018-10-17 21:11:07 Saving hamsters is a shoe-in for re-election, especially when your campaign issues reflect not people but big oil, big guns, & Russian oligarchs. I note that @RepMcCaul has also been using a little girl as a mascot in his campaign.
1707 2018-10-17 21:10:49 Oil has to be replaced, the sooner the better.
Alternative fuels are the key to more independence - independence from authoritarian governments.
As long as we rely on dictators, we are also more vulnerable and have to bend to their will. That's unacceptable and it must change!
1708 2018-10-17 21:10:43 The IEA is full of shit!  They are stating oil inventories are up to protect the current administration’s reputation.  Inventories haven’t changed one bit!  #OilPricesOnTheRise THE US Government manipulating the price of oil once again!  MAKE NO MISTAKE!  $80 WTI BY YEAR END!
1709 2018-10-17 21:10:40 Tell me where I can find that water which mixes with oil!
1710 2018-10-17 21:10:27 It’s the easiest thing to make (I like it simple s’times just w/ a sprinkle of truffle oil and parmasen) and should always be in a pantry. You have no excuse! 
1711 2018-10-17 21:10:25 Saudi fake news from the desert has started. Stick to camel riding and slave boys. The kingdom is over! Tick tock! We need your oil!
1712 2018-10-17 21:10:23 Rising oil prices is bad, but kill a man & trump is on board after 100 mill dollars bribe! 100 more & the oil price can be heavenly high & he won’t care!
1713 2018-10-17 21:10:21 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
1714 2018-10-17 21:10:14 The cashier at the place I get my oil change done at gave me $7 off just because... #blessup
1715 2018-10-17 21:10:12 I take fish oil twice a day and that sure helped but when this season starts my eyes act up
1716 2018-10-17 21:10:09 Hasn't seem to bother the City fans Percy and the kopites who claim to be the most Socialist of any fans, anywhere ever, would suck Saudi dick for some oil money. Utd haven't been the fans club since Edwards snr bought out all the small shareholders.
1717 2018-10-17 21:10:08 they want oil and deals for building planes and stuff they do not care that a good man lost his life
it will be a stain on us all but in the end  Yes they will  just let it stand
1718 2018-10-17 21:10:04 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1719 2018-10-17 21:10:02 I wish there was some way we could show the Saudi's that we mean business and don't need their oil anymore...
Just can't think of one.

1722 2018-10-17 21:09:30 Firstly, the US was a major buyer of Venezuelan oil - hardly destroying their economy were they?

Secondly, the underlying economy was shot to bits, only think keeping it going was oil. When oil prices dropped it showed how poorly the underlying economy was actually performing.
1723 2018-10-17 21:09:27 Scheduled my regular oil change and tire rotation for 8am on Monday and I wanna know why I’m excited for it? I don’t want to continue as an adult.

1726 2018-10-17 21:09:21 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO PUT OIL IN PASTA WATER THAT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE
1727 2018-10-17 21:09:17 I use to mix a mother’s nature , baby lotion , vaseline and vitamin E oil and the stretch mark cream all together and I didn’t get not one.

1729 2018-10-17 21:09:05 Ps 23:4-5 KJV
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
1730 2018-10-17 21:08:53 Surely Canada can to better than "...look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough, credible, transparent, and prompt investigation"? With serious evidence of state torture/murder, why rely on SA to do justice? Let them keep their oil & undeserved wealth.
1731 2018-10-17 21:08:48 Why tf buddy paying damn near $1100/mth for a R/T charger lol. You can get a Demon for that price  free oil changes & tire rotation though. Like Walmart don't do that shit for $39.98.
1732 2018-10-17 21:08:43 What about oil carts going into the arena?
1733 2018-10-17 21:08:41 Its not murder if you have the oil
1734 2018-10-17 21:08:37 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
1735 2018-10-17 21:08:34 camo has never been my thing, but then i found out oil field camo was a thing and now it’s DEFINITELY not my thing.
1736 2018-10-17 21:08:33 Sources say two sites are being assessed as possible locations for a naphtha cracker plant to be jointly built by C-P-C and Indonesia's state-run oil and gas company, P-T Pertamina.
1737 2018-10-17 21:08:24 You've provided none of these things. Not for women, not for men. You have no principles. You overlook murder for arms money and Saudi oil. You have blood on your hands. Shame on you.
1738 2018-10-17 21:08:15 Canadian crude oil price discounts vs. Brent just Chuck Norris'ed the y-axis on close to a dozen of my charts... #broken
1739 2018-10-17 21:08:14 I drive Teslas and talk to housecall techs in Malibu. Most have worked for many car companies, and they love Tesla: So simple. No oil, no spark plugs, no carburetors. very few moving parts. Tuneups are downloads. A beautiful machine. You're just feeling left out/left behind.
1740 2018-10-17 21:08:11 They may have released their tax returns (donnie john should too), but there is no big secret here. It’s about oil. Nations have started wars for it, governments have collapsed for the lack of it, young men for generations have died for it #itsaboutoil
1741 2018-10-17 21:08:11 Saudi Arabia’s only export is oil. You want @realDonaldTrump to do what? Impose sanctions? Start a war? Over what may or may not be an incident. Turkey (not our best friend) is the “source” for info. How would Turkey benefit if US and SA drifted apart???
1742 2018-10-17 21:08:01 Agreed, an excellent film, brilliant effects, But also an eye opener on the greed of oil companies and the damage and fatalities that resulted.
1743 2018-10-17 21:07:50 Essential oil for your lady bits

1745 2018-10-17 21:07:43 Norway found the same oil fields. Nationalised it. Statoil. Kept all the money. The westmonster government sold it. No asset= no borrowing= no future.
1746 2018-10-17 21:07:42 Identity politics is big business for quangos, sociology departments and #fakenews peddlers such as @TodaySOR et al - modern snake oil salesmen or is that salespeople 
1747 2018-10-17 21:07:38 Lol delete this, Cesc jacked her from a oil tycoon & she popped out 4 kids for him, doesn’t get as Alpha as that.
1748 2018-10-17 21:07:37 Mvura and oil will never mix. U're such a dimwit haha 
1749 2018-10-17 21:07:35 You gotta love a #recipe that has you braise pork belly in olive oil and lard for 3 hours.
1750 2018-10-17 21:07:32 Wait, what oil?
1751 2018-10-17 21:07:27 Surely we are not still that dependent on them for oil.  So it must be an emolument type of thing.
1752 2018-10-17 21:07:24 The Dems will include anyone to get them into office!! Because when the Democrats take office the media will never tell you how much they are giving away of your hard earned money!! So vote the Carnaval snake oil salesman into office!!
1753 2018-10-17 21:07:05 And yall dont know what oil is
1754 2018-10-17 21:07:01 Curly girls: do we do our hot oil treatments before or after shampooing?? 
1755 2018-10-17 21:07:00 "Radicals? They work at oil companies, & coal companies & gas companies. They're willing to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere to make money. No one has ever done anything more radical than that."

@billmckibben, Oil & Honey, p.44
1756 2018-10-17 21:06:54 Flaring is more than "oil" issue. But accepting your classification, why not tell oil producers, responsible gas companies won't buy gas from oil producers that don't meet flaring standard?
1757 2018-10-17 21:06:50 My dad told me I was gonna have to go take my car in to get an oil change BY MYSELF cause he can’t come and I’m actually freaking out haha
1758 2018-10-17 21:06:49 I hope they hand out thousands like it .... pot is mbs new oil !!!! We need every penny
1759 2018-10-17 21:06:46 Actually the USA is the main source of hard cash for the regime, being the purchaser if the majority of Venezuelan oil
1760 2018-10-17 21:06:46 If you’re paying 40.00 for craft essential oil you should prob be posting this is the anti MLM sub.
1761 2018-10-17 21:06:35 I was told water comes out of a whales head and that they were used for lamp oil .  Also that finishing your plate was a good thing ..and that lying was wrong and you could never be president if you were a liar
1762 2018-10-17 21:06:19 And where was the study conducted? Where I live, the drop-outs would top the chart, as the oil rigs hire them out of high school and pay them more than just about any other industry.
1763 2018-10-17 21:06:10 Is this the same Turkey that was buying oil from ISIS while killing Kurdish militias fighting against ISIS? I'm not even convinced Erdogan didn't stage the pathetic "coup" to further his own dictatorial aspirations.
1764 2018-10-17 21:06:09 CBD oil. Or valerian. Xx
1765 2018-10-17 21:06:06 camo has never been my thing, but then i found out oil field camo was a thing and now it’s DEFINITELY not my thing. #fracmylife
1766 2018-10-17 21:06:05 The oil is good for pain? I didn't know that. Thanks!
 I only know about the neuro & immune stuffs.
1767 2018-10-17 21:05:58 Note on simple and reliable oil predictions by OR-gate testing. "You follow me?"
Also for the next 10 years. #Value #Valueformoney #Brent #Nymex #oil #predictions @DowJones #LondonStockExchange @faznet #oilpredictions #stockmarkets @AlJazeera #QuantumComputing @OilandEnergy
1768 2018-10-17 21:05:56 No. The US using it's military and economic might is to blame. This isn't hard.
You could argue that Venezuela put all of its eggs into the oil basket, which was always a risky strategy. But that is hardly a fault of socialism.
1769 2018-10-17 21:05:49 and that box be slippery like trying to walk on oil 
1770 2018-10-17 21:05:47 "They" is not possessive; "their" is. Another failed attempt at snark.

You really are a fourth-level troll. Not clever, not informed, a real turd in the punch bowl. I actually admire good trolling, but every amateur thinks he's a wit these days.
1771 2018-10-17 21:05:43 Hell yeah! US citizenship or no,oil money worth more than U obviously,listen best way to avoid being amputated while still alive  is 2 just chant “Long live MBS” while entering Saudi embassy..or go w/ group of ppl, just tell them your account has been hacked 4 all those yrs lol
1772 2018-10-17 21:05:36 Don't you have more important things to do than point out a shot-up sign? Like protect our national parks, our lands, our rivers, our streams, our natural monuments? Like stand up to corporate development, fracking, oil and gas development, etc.? You're just a stooge pretender.
1773 2018-10-17 21:05:35 He is such a Coward. And it all comes down to money. They gave him money, they bought Condos, And they are our biggest supplier of oil. They have him cornered every bit as much as Putin does.
1774 2018-10-17 21:05:31 Hi Steve, next news on this damn rig is when the green flag comes down, shed load to come then, assets, funding, oil, & of course the gas ! & there’s still a twist in the tale #exciting
1775 2018-10-17 21:05:29 Speaking of gas station if the economy & jobs are why is gas increasing? It's $3.55/gallon in #Seattle & was $2.50ish Last year or the year before #justsaying @realDonaldTrump #Saudi Really screwed you on the oil #deal or was it @JustinTrudeau retaliation for NAFTA drama 
1776 2018-10-17 21:05:22 What made zero sense was that video because you had no idea that Coker units need to be replaced in order to process oil sands bitumen. Next time give me a call and I would be happy to explain why it’s an export terminal not replacing foreign oil use in Atlantic Canada.
1777 2018-10-17 21:05:14 They're not the only oil producers.
1778 2018-10-17 21:05:11 Human oil can
1779 2018-10-17 21:05:11 @realDonaldTrump where's the man that was going to tell the saudis they're not going to raise the fucking oil prices? #washup #hasbeen
1780 2018-10-17 21:05:04 another thing  I  do know.. which I  was  follOwing,,  years  ago..one  good reason  they  were making these  man made  islands.  building  condos..  fancy hotels  to  build  tourism.. they know  their  oil  will  not  last  forever.  they needed other  incomes. 
SO..
1781 2018-10-17 21:04:56 Disagree completely and strongly against the three first points
Fourth point is arguable but to no significant degree (defense policy slightly).
don’t forget saudi:
- big strength over oil prices
- could switch sides to Russia, China incl. buying military equipment
enough levers.
1782 2018-10-17 21:04:53 Crazy to think how Silicon Valley companies of all sizes have Saudi oil money invested into them. 3% of Tesla, $1B invested into Uber and have seeded hundreds of others we all know and love. Quite the ethical conundrum. Will this effect VC raises on a macro level in 2019 though?
1783 2018-10-17 21:04:48 I agree Oil is not Qatar's Future. LNG has its limits is my point. To offset the revenue lost from Oil in 5 years with LNG means, Qatar has to increase production 5 times roughly. And seeing as They burn it for 79% of their energy. Big ask.
1784 2018-10-17 21:04:47 I thought about rebranding as like an oil heir type of account where I post stolen photos of Patek Philippe watches and Ferraris with captions like "get on my level bitches"
1785 2018-10-17 21:04:42 Until we are oil independent, I couldn't raise my hand at all to this.
1786 2018-10-17 21:04:11 i could for amazing Italian food - like fancy with salad and the bread and olive oil top Italian food .... 
1787 2018-10-17 21:04:09 I’d be so healthy harvesting my extra virgin olive oil. Man what a dream lmao. I want a farm and I want to harvest olive oil fucking dream!
1788 2018-10-17 21:04:09 Oil doesn't vote, but one starts wondering what is going on when big companies move their capital from Alberta to Saskatchewan.
1789 2018-10-17 21:04:07 Apple and sugar/palm oil free nut butter 
1790 2018-10-17 21:03:47 Agree! I live in the Central Valley (Cali) & we don't get farm fresh foods. Like seriously, Cali grows a ton of food & I'm surrounded by Ag. Also, if you love Halos (and maybe Cuties) oranges, seriously I'd think twice before you eat them. I've seen them grown next to oil fields.
1791 2018-10-17 21:03:43 Why?  Treasury is the steward of us economic and financial systems and is an influential participant in the world economy is it not? Messing w oil affects our economy...
1792 2018-10-17 21:03:41 Productive off day oil change , got lil mans nails shaped up
1793 2018-10-17 21:03:38 Els orígens dels Catalans són als territoris Katalaunics, diuen a Metz, aprox.... la llengua és l,lemosina i si vols posar-hi el tòtem d'Otger Cataló doncs ja és a gust del consumidor, però el tema llemosí langue d'oc i langue d'oil és CONTUNDENT... aqui som el que som i som ÒC !
1794 2018-10-17 21:03:36 I’m using coconut oil but it hurts soooo bad hahahahaha
1795 2018-10-17 21:03:28 @shattawalegh From the way the REIGN album is going down de3 , last show ei go discover oil o 
1796 2018-10-17 21:03:21 We stopped doing that in England in the late 1700's. France abolished the Guillotine in 1977. Saudis still have public beheadings. If they didn't have oil, we would not give them the time of day.
1797 2018-10-17 21:03:21 They were mad about an oil pipeline bush insisted on putting in ... Or that was the gist at a saudi convention shortly after 9-11
1798 2018-10-17 21:03:17 Updated dream job: owning and harvesting high quality extra virgin olive oil in Tuscany/Greece.
1799 2018-10-17 21:03:16 Canada can always cut back + buy oil fr. those smaller nations too- help prop their economy -SA isn't only supplier- also, get Canada send some form of self-sustaining food source
1800 2018-10-17 21:03:07 Totally agree with you. Oil and gas exploration and production are controversial, and dog fighting is unethical

1803 2018-10-17 21:03:02 I know, I'm just being snarky. I found a suggestion for a similar oil called Perseids, which I might try after I finish my bottle. Is that the one you meant? Saving money is always good!

We will be glad if you can help us sir
God bless as u do
1806 2018-10-17 21:02:31 And maybe perhaps some of the loss of investment could be because of depressed prices for oil? Oil doesn't vote. And Alberta party in charge doesn't set the price.
1807 2018-10-17 21:02:12 We look forward to working with French Deputy Enviro Minister @EmmWargon to counter anti-Palm Oil policies in France & Europe, including the “Deforestation Criteria” stemming from Brussels, an attempt to discriminate against Malaysian small farmers and label Palm Oil as “risky”
1808 2018-10-17 21:02:12 Careful of unintended consequences to our economy from a knee jerk reaction to this. There are other ways without cancelling a lucrative contract for the U.S. and possibly oil ramifications. Yes, a WaPo reporters execution is tragic, but how about Seth Rich ?
1809 2018-10-17 21:02:06 Canada makes up 43% of US oil imports, SA is less than 20%.
1810 2018-10-17 21:02:05 Nope, my feet feel AMAZING. There's exfoliating, and hacking off, and clipping, and oil treatments, and lotions, and soaking tubs with jets. These hooves are HAPPEH.

1814 2018-10-17 21:01:45 As long as #SaudiArabia has oil, the world will do nothing about the murder of  #JamalKashoggi the war & famine in #Yemen the rights of women & #slavelabour in the kingdom. Cynical but probably true.
1815 2018-10-17 21:01:24 Wait, are you now saying Scotland = NI ??  You must be fun at parties.
Scotland has oil and is a normal country. NI is a bunch of homophobes which a #brexit will impoverish #StopBrexit
1816 2018-10-17 21:01:23 incase anybody's wondering how my skin is as clear as it normally is, go to target and buy "rosehip facial oil". on god its great to acne scars and acne and dry skin and i love it
1817 2018-10-17 21:01:19 Ummm. . . Would you care to comment on today’s stock market decline?

Also the growing annual deficit and and national debt?

Also mortgage rates at a 7 year high?
 
Also consumer spending is up because of the tariffs?

Price of gas and fuel oil up significantly too!
1818 2018-10-17 21:01:12 He's got his fingers in the top two oil producing countries in the world. The money flows are MASSIVE.
1819 2018-10-17 21:01:10 Oil money blood money
1820 2018-10-17 21:01:09 It also created a structural dependence of the USSR on US grain imports and the foreign loans to pay for them and the oil sales that backed those foreign loans, weakening impetus for agricultural reform and contributing to the unravelling of the whole Soviet system
1821 2018-10-17 21:01:09 Why should they? Britain seems like a gathering of wholly- divergent tented sheiks, looking for an oasis to squat beside, waiting for a genie to appear, out of their lamps, except that the oil has run out, thanks to past opulence and bullshit.
1822 2018-10-17 21:01:08 It would be better to just say, Oil is the only thing muslims have to keep them from being listed as barbarians.

1846 2018-10-17 20:59:53 A hot oil massage sounds so good right now...
1847 2018-10-17 20:59:51 Why is everyone suddenly acting surprised that Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship? They've been doing stuff like this for decades and both Republicans and Democrats have been cool with it because oil.

Now suddenly it's an issue?
1848 2018-10-17 20:59:51 Oh no! What’s your heating, gas or oil? If it’s gas Daniel o donnell says you have to get a professional in but YouTube got me and Emmie through
1849 2018-10-17 20:59:50 1992 is when they settled present kakuma,then their houses were makeshifts made of either twigs of acacia, doompalms, veg oil tins. This confused locals for temporal/ taking refuge. Grazing fields were taken away, pastoralists displaced and locals were told...they go back. When?
1850 2018-10-17 20:59:50 effects of canola oil in the "stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat." Is that what we're calling the chosenites now?
1851 2018-10-17 20:59:49 I don't believe in sticking to one party. I choose who has the best platform. When they are lying & providing misleading info before the election I clearly can't trust them after. The only thing that will fix our issues are higher oil prices because the PCs didn't diversify.
1852 2018-10-17 20:59:29 Trump pushes the fiction that regulations are not needed and cost jobs. The truth is that regulation is the only real check on corporate greed, corruption,and the literal harming (poisoning, environmental degradation, etc.) of citizens. Every oil spill costs thousands of jobs...
1853 2018-10-17 20:59:22 Why its toothless is bcoz consumers dnt utilise it!Consumers are continously buying cooking oil at these exobirtant prices ...for what really??!if we refuse to buy they wont sell until they sober up in their pricing
1854 2018-10-17 20:59:17 We've reached a point where oh, yeah, you can be prez.  You can't do any worse than the current occupant.  Disqualifiers would be bodies discovered under your house or documented evidence that you boil puppies in oil.
1855 2018-10-17 20:59:17 I wish we could flood the market with our own oil and drop the prices. 
However I know some things can't necessarily be done for reason we dont know. #WWG1WGA

1872 2018-10-17 20:57:29 Our oil industry lays offshore pipes every day. Upwelling Cold water brings Nitrates up and embellishes the "food web" which cause growth in the fish population. A 1" pipe 500 miles long holds the same amount of air as the Goodyear blimp.
1873 2018-10-17 20:57:23 Why? Are we running out of oil again? Or do we have lots of arms we need shot of?
1874 2018-10-17 20:57:21 Oh that's like, a Texas trademark thing of the oil fields you see in around the Midland area.

Texas has lots of them.

Guaranteed Mutual assured destruction.
1882 2018-10-17 20:56:24 Look, Saudi Arabia is a problem for us. There’s The Oil Problem, of course - and that’s big, but not the only thing.
There’s also The Terrorism Problem, which may actually be bigger than The Oil Problem that we cynically blame for *everything*.  /1
1883 2018-10-17 20:56:16 There isn't a nuclear plant near the Bay of Quinte Jim. The only non-operating power plant is Wesleyville which was an oil fired plant that was started but unfinished. All the nuclear plants are operational.
1884 2018-10-17 20:56:13 Aren't they an oil rich country?  trump seems to be attracted to wealth, power, prestige and finding the worst rich crowd to run with. I wouldn't doubt that he wasn't involved. Or instigated in some way. Didn't the reporter work for The Washington Post? trump hates that paper.
1885 2018-10-17 20:56:12 And so I don't have to throw the shirt out because I got olive oil on there.

Asthma, respiratory infections, bronchitis, emphysema, etc. All of those conditions are worsened by worse air quality, which costs MONEY. Again. Oil. Is. Not. Cheap.

1891 2018-10-17 20:55:43 It's especially gross, in my humble, because the oil company was grousing about a damages payout of $100,000 (on top of the fair-market value of the house).  Frankly, that just seems like such a pittance--and almost certainly covered by business insurance. It just seems mean.
1892 2018-10-17 20:55:41 I got olive oil on a shirt that I really liked while I was cooking yesterday and didn't want to have to throw it out.
1893 2018-10-17 20:55:33 I hope this is a wake up call to our government and their willingness to turn a blind eye to the House of Saud’s atrocities these many years while we used them for our own purposes in the region. Let them play with the price of Oil.
1894 2018-10-17 20:55:29 It's not just the oil itself because the cost of every day things will go up.
1895 2018-10-17 20:55:27 Yeah, that's not that hard to figure out. There's plenty of space between working to figure out how fracking and urban development can co-exist and banning oil and gas production from 98% of the state.
1896 2018-10-17 20:55:25 I've been waiting two hours for this oil change to happen. Smh.
1897 2018-10-17 20:55:19 The deficit has exploded because of your tax cuts, you are planning to slash Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and you are shielding bloodcurdling murderers for oil
1898 2018-10-17 20:55:18 Happy #NationalPastaDay !  All you need to make homemade pasta is 3 eggs, 2 cups of flour, salt, and a tablespoon of water or oil to make a basic pasta dough that can be cut or rolled into a variety of shapes. Give fresh pasta a try! :) #pasta #pastaday

1900 2018-10-17 20:54:35 Yea right, so says the folks who want us to go remain on Coal and Oil. Who tax and even outlaw Solar. Yea right.
1901 2018-10-17 20:54:34 I can tell you what I want to see less of. Less oil slicked, ‘roided up muscle men the colour of chorizo please. Also want to see older people there and less kids
1902 2018-10-17 20:54:33 Well 9 months in the oil field and finally got told off by someone

1905 2018-10-17 20:54:15 @The_Oil_Hut well that would be 60 I believe.
1906 2018-10-17 20:54:12 Which would bring down the price per barrel of oil.The Saudis CIA are the leaders of Isis & other clandestine terrorist organizations the Saudi king runs this terrorism. I have no proof of this but who's making the money from terrorism I tell you it's not the people who are dying
1907 2018-10-17 20:54:11 Hey CBD Oil - K Guzman(@CbdYour), thank you for following me
1908 2018-10-17 20:54:10 The Trump tax cut sugar high is wearing off. We are now faced with record monthly deficits& additional $2.2Tril in debt resulting from those tax cuts. Inflation&high gas prices have returned&the housing market & DOW are stagnant. Tariffs are hurting farmers/manf./oil producers.
1909 2018-10-17 20:54:06 Anyone from church pray for him to be healed? With oil?

1911 2018-10-17 20:53:59 See ideas can be formulated and passed on to generation like though it really happened.  The Biafra guys needed more hands, they needed all the support and they also know the ND was a oil rich region that could play a vital role in the war.

1913 2018-10-17 20:53:47 backward vertical integration is complicated for oil expressers.Frm a manufacturing point of view its also.important to remember that one cannot easily alter prdn processes over demand created by speculation,it wouldnt make business sense
1914 2018-10-17 20:53:42 The U.S needs the Saudi’s hlep to prevent iran from becaoming a new North Korea in the MENA.

The U.S can not impose sanctions on Iran without the help of the Saudi Arabia in raising crude oil production to curb the rise in oil price.

NOVEMBER IS COMING
1915 2018-10-17 20:53:42 ... obviously. Eating fruit supports the gas industry if it has been shipped, using a plastic toothbrush supports oil, but cutting out meat has a drastically larger impact on pollution. You are objectively incorrect if you can't see this.
1916 2018-10-17 20:53:41 duh, anybody watching oil has seen it falling for days.
1917 2018-10-17 20:53:37 Eat well. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid multiple hair treatments. Is it NISIM or NHB? makes hair healthier. or closely related. I cannot seem to unearth the true and official source. An affordable gift. Need to buy some.

1921 2018-10-17 20:53:20 Well if you care about poor people then you would act with restraint as well. $200 a barrel oil would become a reality if we don’t play this one right. Think about the devastating effect that would have poor people, people of color, etc. It would cripple our economy.
1922 2018-10-17 20:53:15 You’ll need the Rainbow Warrior 90 tonne diesel tanks filled right up to get out there and protest about how viable a world without oil is.

1931 2018-10-17 20:52:27 That's how they do it in saudi. Tale as old as oil money.

1934 2018-10-17 20:52:13 What should the punishment be for causing 100 hours of disruption?

1946 2018-10-17 20:51:05 So, we have to be nice to the reporter-killing KSA because we have "investments" there. Notably, they are a major oil source.

Thus reinforcing the point made years ago and ignored by @GOP #Trumpublicans: Renewable energy sources reduce dependence on terrorist despots.

1980 2018-10-17 20:49:05 Hi Cindy. I just found this as I’m doing some research on the issue. My Camry blew on me yesterday while on the highway and I had NO oil and was just around my 3000! Scary stuff!! Is your daughters vehicle ok or does she need a repair?
1981 2018-10-17 20:48:58 I have the ones with the oil packet type too. I like to mix in whatever random veggies I’ve got.
1982 2018-10-17 20:48:57 Saudi Arabia has been financing terrorism for decades. An unstable Middle East makes it easier for the Saudis to sell their oil keeping prices High. If other Middle Eastern countries were not fighting with each other they could stabilize the oil industry which would bring down
1983 2018-10-17 20:48:56 it turns out the overlap between people who work in the oil fields and people who check in on twitter is small

1988 2018-10-17 20:48:34 You look amazing! I had mine done at the age 49 along with my 15 year old daughter . It hurt for a few weeks but settled down.  I recommend bathing it in tea tree oil and warm water.

1990 2018-10-17 20:48:14 And general consensus last year was that we'd be a cup contender, so these things should be taken with a grain of salt.
1991 2018-10-17 20:48:12 Dead on, one of the guys I was with hailed from Australia and was a huge Midnight Oil fan and was absolutely blown away by the Hip performance.
1992 2018-10-17 20:48:10 If Iran were smart they'd know the only thing that'll keep the U.S. away from their oil are Nuclear Weapons.

My wife has fobromyalgia and RA. She is very active, but in constant severe pain. She won't take opioids because they turn her into a zombie. We are in Vegas and I got her THC based oil and lotion. They are the only thing that alleviates the pain.
1994 2018-10-17 20:47:58 Trump has to consider Oil prices too?  Could go way above $200 ekkkk??? He F@#ked every which way he turns 
1995 2018-10-17 20:47:55 no, but I was breathing heavily (from pain, not pleasure) from having to suffer chili oil on my dick, so I'm sure I inadvertently blew on the yoghurt at some point
1996 2018-10-17 20:47:42 We subsidize farmers because food is an essential resource...then we allow businesses to sell Real,natural resources like Oil and Water to Foreign nations wich drives the price up for us. 
What's wrong with that picture.

2006 2018-10-17 20:46:06 Why didn’t anyone tell me that it takes an hour to get an oil change? 
2007 2018-10-17 20:46:05 So, and just thinking out loud here... 

If we switched to electric vehicles we would use a whole lot less gasoline, and therefore oil, which would reduce our dependency on other countries.

It would significantly reduce greenhouse emissions and there are tax breaks for this.
2008 2018-10-17 20:46:04 Oil crude oil gone by december 2023 millions 86 mill world wide batrels used per day is this right
2009 2018-10-17 20:46:03 You are smart!  Went on a blocking spree awhile ago and LOVE threads sooo much more now. No more clutter, ugliness, stupidity, and nasty... These trolls are designed to disrupt and blocking removes their oil soaked voices. Now a fw blocks a day keeps things clean...like EV's! 
2010 2018-10-17 20:45:57 Look at the results last year and the preseason prognostications.  General consensus is that they're contending for a playoff spot, but by no means a slam dunk.

That's not good enough.

2013 2018-10-17 20:45:52 this reminds me of that one time I had to slather my dick with yoghurt to fix a minor chemical burn caused by chili oil because I forgot to wash my hands before adjusting
2014 2018-10-17 20:45:48 I been taking black seed oil and it's been working wonders. I ran out and today I have a persistent headache! Let me get to Asher to get a bottle. I'm not doing any sickness or disease or popping of synthetic pills.
2015 2018-10-17 20:45:28 Yeah who knows how long the potatoes have been sitting in dry storage before peeling and cutting? If they are not fresh, they tend to dry up on cooking. Oil is not the problem.
2016 2018-10-17 20:45:21 @realDonaldTrump and Pompeo are getting behind Saudi Arabia for now. It’s a deft political move to protect the oil our supply. Also the Saudi Prince is trying to get his country more respect internationally. There are many factions that I am sure would like him to fail.
2017 2018-10-17 20:45:20 Pranayama breathing techniques and CBD oil.
2018 2018-10-17 20:45:17 I was thinking, Saudi Barbaria says they would jack the price of oil to punish the world against sanctions. Wouldn't dropping the price of oil i.e. sub40 be a different kind of pain? #blackswan #oott

2022 2018-10-17 20:45:02 It feels like I’m surfing in oil spillage
2023 2018-10-17 20:44:54 Only under this administration would Saudi Arabia feel strong enough to threaten the United States of America with $400/barrel oil prices.
2024 2018-10-17 20:44:48 The House of Saud are basically the Bumkin Billionaires of the desert, ....with swords.

Ditch the oil, end the tyranny.
2025 2018-10-17 20:44:41 Does the Chamber of Commerce support eliminating protections for pre-existing health conditions like you do? Is the Chamber of Commerce excited about offshore oil drilling in California? Does CoC feel strongly that we detain 2 year old refugees as a deterrence to others ?
2026 2018-10-17 20:44:40 Ted Cruz endorsed Roy Moore and when asked if he should be expelled from the Senate if elected said, “Of course not.”

2031 2018-10-17 20:44:16 I think it'll take me years to consume this. I still have a joint from 2012. 

CBD is the sleepy oil ? I just want to mellow out before bed and sleep like a log.
2032 2018-10-17 20:44:11 According to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy, global oil reserves at the end of 2012 were 1.7 trillion barrels. Given that the world consumes about 86 million barrels of crude oil per day, it would be easy to conclude we'll run out of oil in 55 years, 15

2034 2018-10-17 20:44:03 @realDonaldTrump Hey, idiot!  Really looking forward to your plans on how exactly you’re going to ship all this oil you like so much out of Alaska without an international shipping agreement.
2035 2018-10-17 20:43:57 Our #1 importer of oil is Canada  and trump claims they’re our enemy. It’s got to do with who’s lining his family’s bank accounts he doesn’t give a shit about this country
2036 2018-10-17 20:43:35 I have this same problem! My eye doctor reccomends Fish oil supplements and blink gel eye drops really help
2037 2018-10-17 20:43:34 I mean, it's a big deal. I don't smoke myself. I use CBD oil to help with medical needs since that's legal here and weed is not.
2038 2018-10-17 20:43:32 It does the job!

I got into spicy-tomato tinned mackerel a few years back because I realised that with brine/ springwater / oil you end up tossing some of the fish oils with the buffer.

I keep anchovies, tuna, and sardines. In tins.

2040 2018-10-17 20:43:23 But it is sealioning to ask to be brought up to speed on a subject you not only know nothing about, but actively denied the existence of, from a place of ignorance.

Trust me, if you believe that Trump knows anything about ANYTHING, you are a boob who has been taken in by the snake oil salesman. You make a fool of yourself each time you are on CNN

2048 2018-10-17 20:43:08 Canada is a way bigger trading partner and produces far more oil. Guess which country has more illicit deals with the Trump Crime Family.
2049 2018-10-17 20:43:04 Yes, it's canola oil.

2053 2018-10-17 20:42:47 Trump’s fatal error was overestimating the average American’s willingness to serve at the pleasure of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. We need to re-assess arming SA in Yemen, we need to end dependence on foreign oil for good, AND none of us want to lay cover for Jared Kushner.
2054 2018-10-17 20:42:47 Street prices right now are 40 per g of hash oil and 160 per oz of flower no tax included ofcourse. Just for the heads up.

2056 2018-10-17 20:42:41 No one is delivering me heating oil. It's going to be 33 degrees tonight. #standardoil sucks and stopped delivering to me last January.
2057 2018-10-17 20:42:38 I used to laugh at my dad for cooking without a shirt and always getting oil popped on his stomach but I’m out here cooking sausages with a crop top and this oil is attacking me 
2058 2018-10-17 20:42:35 When will you oil and gas folks (pipeliners) realize you are indeed being paid by government handouts (subsidies)? Same with farmers and ranchers. Republicans complain about government handouts all the time and fail to realize that’s how they make their money.

2060 2018-10-17 20:42:34 CBD  ( non psychoactive cannabis oil) oil mixed w/ MCT oil (medium chain triglycerides, probably from coconut).
Your immune system will love you for it. Your bank account, not so much.

It's the CBD that just bit you in the fiscal bumm.
2061 2018-10-17 20:42:18 (CBD oil- naturally kills pain and there's no other negative effects possible)
2062 2018-10-17 20:42:15 Umm...steamed? 
Usually I’d lightly fry it with a little butter to play up its gentle bite but tonight felt, what with the oil from the chorizo and the cheese sauce, it was rich enough. I find the inherent saltiness of samphire very useful in taking the edge off dairy.
2063 2018-10-17 20:42:12 My mom has been insisting I drink hemp oil mixed with flavored vodka to “honor Canada” since I think.. 8am
2064 2018-10-17 20:42:11 That's made my day! If trump doesn't keep up the repayments watching the Saudi's meter out their kind of punishment.

2066 2018-10-17 20:41:55 And for oil producers the dollar is even more important because +90% of the oil must be traded in dollars.  And then it's not easy to convert these dollars in a different currency.  China may change (may be changing) this.
2067 2018-10-17 20:41:52 OR that the future of our nation depends on them selling us oil...
2068 2018-10-17 20:41:44 Just think of them as giant sacks of potatoes. Potatoes aren't scary, and if they give you any shit, you can just julienne them and fry them in sunflower oil!
2069 2018-10-17 20:41:33 Let’s hope these scare stories are not true and that there are no UK preparations for an increasingly likely ‘no deal’.

Then - as food, oil, medicines, car parts run short, flights are grounded and queues lengthen at borders - we can congratulate ourselves on our foresight. 
2070 2018-10-17 20:41:29 If he did react, they'd blame him for OPEC driving up oil prices.
2071 2018-10-17 20:41:28 It was unreal. Remember how gorgeous it was ? And the music was unreal, just after Fully and right before Day for Night. They had the magic that's for sure. Midnight Oil were awesome and had global appeal and The Hip still blew them away.

2076 2018-10-17 20:41:06 I also feel its one of these our western friends who sell our crude oil back to us is the reason why we'll never get our own refineries working and keep importing crude oil. They make billions off us and give us peanuts in form of 'aid'  and grants

He was never going to seriously do anything about it and everyone knows it. Saudis have loaned him boatloads of money.
2103 2018-10-17 20:38:28 #PresidentDickTater and Mohammed bin Salman have a deal.

2118 2018-10-17 20:35:38 I feel like we were more decent before our politicians were so influenced by big donors. Now we let journalists get murdered and chopped up in order to protect our oil interests. And our Com in Chief just shrugs it off.

2137 2018-10-17 20:34:11 They don't appear to understand the technical difference between cryptos when they say utility tokens can go that low. That's like saying oil will be worth less because more people use it. Backwards thinking.

$btc they could be accurate, but still all speculation.

U can look out at Billions of pounds of oil being pumped yet ur poor.
Ask the TORY WHY?
2144 2018-10-17 20:33:57 Never a real problem before. 

Try to imagine oleaginous western imperialism without it's beating black, oil pumping heart.
2145 2018-10-17 20:33:53 My mom is letting the crackhead neighbor change her oil and he has nothing to fucking put the oil in or a jack to lift the car up lmao
2146 2018-10-17 20:33:47 Why not put sensors on all oil reserves in the world that have not been drilled yet, you will get much bigger CO2 readings

Right now he's one of the best bargains in the league.
2156 2018-10-17 20:32:36 No the point. The Saudis are still in business. Only lowering global demand for oil (and its price) will hurt them.

2249 2018-10-17 20:24:48 I never asked you anything. You stepped to me out of nowhere and have been spouting lies and bullshit ever since. I obviously know more about all these subjects than you do. Trumpers are a lo-info demographic.

2251 2018-10-17 20:24:37 Recall that Trump said he wanted more torture. That he wanted to kill family members of terrorists. That he wanted to kill them and take their oil.
Recall he wanted the death penalty for 5 innocent youths in NYC -- even after they were proven innocent.
He's a sociopath.

2260 2018-10-17 20:23:35 All of this is, of course, completely hypothetical. And I know we've both had this argument 100 times over the last 3 years, but at a certain point you gotta get over it man. The oilers have been good since then whether you want to admit it or not.

2263 2018-10-17 20:23:04 Go back to ElPaso and learn to be more mexican or something. DON'T let Beeeeeettoooooeeee vote yes on adding a $10 gasoline tax on oil because the prices will climb about .40-.50 cents per Gallon at the pump. But if you want $4 dollar a gallon gas go ahead.
2264 2018-10-17 20:22:53 Rather than argue from ignorance on twitter? Definitely.
2265 2018-10-17 20:22:48 TX secession fine, but in a general breakdown it would be taken by some faction, foreign or domestic. Refineries/oil derricks major target, and it's tank country. Coast is vulnerable also.
2266 2018-10-17 20:22:37 Guess @realDonaldTrump did have a manic wand. No, not really. He actually just understands business and knew what was preventing growth. @BarackObama was a  oil salesman chirping about hope & change while Trump actually delivered it.

2268 2018-10-17 20:22:33 One study says the  state will lose 100K + jobs over a decade & a loss of $26 bill in state GDP by 2030 & loss of $1 billion in state & local tax revenue annually by banning oil and gas development on land responsible for 85% of all new energy development  in Colorado since 2015.
2269 2018-10-17 20:22:21 I once collected a few different European food pyramids. The differences were fascinating. One of them had salad with olive oil quite low down, separate from other fats which were in the small top layer
2270 2018-10-17 20:22:12 so why are gas prices so high if we are up in oil and gas production
2271 2018-10-17 20:22:11 So how about you stop talking down to me, as you have since you first tweeted at me? If you're serious about learning the facts, you google them until you find a source you consider unbiased. If you just want to troll, you try to #sealion strangers into educating you.
2272 2018-10-17 20:22:04 Cook for another piece of oil and wring it to low.
2273 2018-10-17 20:22:03 Billionaires! Let's follow the economic logic that oil and plastics are actually EXPENSIVE for you, the planet, and humanity. Untangle from oil and we will prosper.

Always have been close relations w/Saudi. I've ?'s here myself.
Oil is another separate issue/problem IMHO!
IMHO-I believe OIL is power&play=$ for oil.

2276 2018-10-17 20:21:51 Our oil is our revenue generating power as well. We can't just use it and kill " our " oil market. It's not that simple.
2277 2018-10-17 20:21:48 RE: that spree of @Itaku RTs

If you can't tell, I'm not opposed to cannabis. I don't buy into the fearmongering, and I've seen the benefits it can have. Hell, a good number of dogs at work benefit from daily CBD oil.

Just be responsible, yeah?
2278 2018-10-17 20:21:47 Stove top. Good thick saucepan or Dutch oven if you need a large quantity, and olive oil. After, melt butter and whatever else you want to add. Garlic and dill for savory, a little salt and honey for sweet, brown sugar for caramel (did that accidentally once; not recommended).
2279 2018-10-17 20:21:43 Ok, but it's like saying,

"Stop the oil!"

2282 2018-10-17 20:21:34 Demers took less money to sign in FLA. Trade happened after Demers meeting. That's enough evidence to suggest he didn't want to come here. Demers wasn't an option
2283 2018-10-17 20:21:29 Dawg I really gotta be slicker than baby oil 
2284 2018-10-17 20:21:25 I have to be honest.....our country has turned a blind eye to what the Saudis do for the sake of oil for a very long time...the blood is on all of us....Is the current administration culpable? Hell yes but this goes back much longer.
2285 2018-10-17 20:21:22 faded from the oil too early today
2286 2018-10-17 20:21:17 I don't hate it, but the Oil derrick was better.

2291 2018-10-17 20:21:02 China imports more oil than the USA, just FYI.
2292 2018-10-17 20:20:46 I think you are wrong. We need the Saudis to keep an eye on Iran.....they are not the best of friends. Iran would like to take over the Middle East and have control of the OIL!!
2293 2018-10-17 20:20:42 Given the situation and the market value of both players at the time (gap is closer than people make it out to be), I do that trade 10/10 times
2294 2018-10-17 20:20:42 Just wait until the next oil shock. I'm so glad that there are finally alternatives to cars now that didn't exist in the 70's and 80's. These idiots are spoiled republican nitwits.
2295 2018-10-17 20:20:42 The sanctions put on Iran are going to strengthen Iran and weaken the United. States. Deprived of oil revenue and imports, Iran will become more self sufficient, just as what happened in Russia. It is a law of economics called the Dutch Disease.
2296 2018-10-17 20:20:27 Watch the oil tap close as soon as you do and shut this country down
2297 2018-10-17 20:20:19 The USA exports more than 3 million barrels of oil per day while importing less than 1 million barrels of oil from SA.

2301 2018-10-17 20:19:50 100 years ago Venezuela was in Military dictatorship and the oil exporting money they had was gone with it. The Chavez era was just 20 years ago. I dont think you need to look that far ahead if you think America will turn out to be Venezuela 2.0
2302 2018-10-17 20:19:46 Currently very tipsy waiting for my car to get an oil change... whoever put a wine bar next to a car place is the smartest person ever

2308 2018-10-17 20:19:21 Is grapeseed oil one of the "healthier" oils to cook with because that's what I bought
2309 2018-10-17 20:19:16 We own the existing pipeline. We shouldn't expand it.

All of this was terrible and stupid, and we shouldn't be subsidizing oil and gas - we should be nationalizing it.

It would be better for Canadian Taxpayers.

2315 2018-10-17 20:18:52 O&M conditioners (Organic Minerals or some such), Davines oil serum thing. It's worth paying a bit extra on this. Super £££ but the serum lasts months, srsly.
2316 2018-10-17 20:18:51 America threw off the shackles of a despotic kingdom in 1776. It is time to give the Saudi citizens the same chance. The oil is not going anywhere.
2317 2018-10-17 20:18:45 Can’t slick a can of oil. Oil already slick.
2318 2018-10-17 20:18:40 "Why is the IRA pushing Taco Bell and Coachella?”

Probably same reason why that other Prigozhin company pushed ISIS out of Syrian oil and gas fields.

2321 2018-10-17 20:18:15 "An advantage that only one group of people has" eg WHITE PEOPLE'S PRIVILEGE. 

Can you wrap your head around the fact that many words in English have more than one common usage? "OR because they are rich" refers to a different type of privilege than the one afforded to a group.
2322 2018-10-17 20:18:06 I think we're all forgetting just how bad the D was before the trade. Oil had picked 1st overall in 4 of 6 years with Hall and Ebs leading the way. 1 year adding McDavid was a failure. New arena opening in fall 2016. Pressure from everyone (fans, ownership) to fix defence...
2323 2018-10-17 20:17:55 Did you know O and O stands for

2325 2018-10-17 20:17:41 Saudi Arabia IS NOT an allied of the United States. Does the US care about Saudi Arabia?? Of course !! It’d be stupid to reject the country with the biggest oil reserves in the world. Does Saudi Arabia care about the US ?? Of course not !! It just wants protection and weapons !!
2326 2018-10-17 20:17:39 @chrisdelatorre Could they substitute legal THC/CBD oil taken orally for the methadone injections thereby not needing needles.

2328 2018-10-17 20:17:37 commercially viable oil reserves will last for about 30 years. electricity cant be exported outwith the uk, and we'll be left to compete with third world countries over the sale of domesticaly manufacured goods.

One dead journalist means nothing to him!
2330 2018-10-17 20:17:31 Keep Hall, don't sign Lucic, sign Demers instead in summer 2016. Basically a cap wash. Ultimately Eberle would have had to go regardless, but it was totally doable.

But instead, they went the Heavy Hockey route and constructed a suboptimal roster.  Thanks Pete!

#NotOverIt
2331 2018-10-17 20:17:27 $2.50 a gallon is actually not that bad. A Middle East crisis can send it to 4.00 and beyond. Remember the oil shortages? We DO depend on oil just stating a fact. None of this is simply explained. Much corruption too
2332 2018-10-17 20:17:25 Still, the only thing that will make the left happy will be the death of both coal and oil. 

To them, it’s easy. No problem to take care of it tomorrow. It’s only there because of money. They’re all infrastructure experts.
2333 2018-10-17 20:17:17 Farmers are essential. We can't live on oil products, we need food, and water.

If they can bail out big oil and gas, they can help farmers, which keeps our food supply stable.
2334 2018-10-17 20:17:13 Yes, a family doctor should be part of the "Welcome Wagon" package!
Besides thet ax, electricity is 2X more expensive, furnace oil is about 2X nat. gas price last time I checked, booze is more here, too.
2335 2018-10-17 20:17:07 When I die, bury me in sparkling old fryer oil !! It's going on!
2336 2018-10-17 20:17:06 it is.
The U.S can not impose sanctions on Iran without the help of the Saudi Arabia in raising crude oil production to curb the rise in oil price
2337 2018-10-17 20:17:00 I could do some painting. Like oil painting?
2338 2018-10-17 20:16:38 My workplace Slack- where you can discuss 5G and Sunday Reilly Luna oil all in one place
2339 2018-10-17 20:16:35 We bet that has a touch of motor oil.

Uh. Like as a sauce. Bad joke. Let us come back to that one.
2340 2018-10-17 20:16:35 I hate getting my oil change!!!
2341 2018-10-17 20:16:30 Listen to the news they want strict sanctions members (dems) of Congress are calling for congressional action.  SA said they would raise oil to 200 dollars a barrel.
2342 2018-10-17 20:16:30 Thanks goodness they got millions of dollars in dirty oil money to pay the carnies to put on a show

2345 2018-10-17 20:16:10 Started taking oil under tongue 3 weeks ago.  After a week I added the vape juice.  Feel better than I have felt in years.  Went from 1200-2000mg of ibuprofen per day, down to zero.  Can't tell u why, but it works!!!!
2346 2018-10-17 20:16:03 A tad more than meen in coconut oil.
2347 2018-10-17 20:15:56 I agree. But when I was in college man I just used that spare jack lol. The oil dropped right by the right tire lol
2348 2018-10-17 20:15:56 But of course, anything else but taxing the oil companies who are trashing our roads with their heavy equipment, trashing our air with methane leaks or with their waste flares.
2349 2018-10-17 20:15:16 Swimming out the oil tryna chase a dollar 
2350 2018-10-17 20:15:09 someone please make an essential oil that will diffuse smelling like the disneyland pirates of the caribbean ride.
2351 2018-10-17 20:15:08 Apparently you are clueless to the geopolitical climate over there. Dump Saudi and you create another power vacuum for China and Russia to get into. Plus oil goes to 200 a barrel, gas over$4.00.  Works out for you, because then you blame Trump.  You really aren’t smart.
2352 2018-10-17 20:15:08 Our ties to SA have been dicey for decades.

Usually it is oil and having a Mideast ally other than Israel. Also a check on Iran's power. 

Now we add giant financial entanglements with the trump family.

This could end poorly for all. 

We may have to rethink this relationship.
2353 2018-10-17 20:14:41 at first I thought it was maybe the oil they fried it in but nope. they violated.
2354 2018-10-17 20:14:36 See luckily my cousin is my stylist so she was able to control it. I did have lots of shedding. My length was crazy. Get some Jamaican black castor oil

2357 2018-10-17 20:14:18 CBD OIL. Also apple cider vinegar shots, put em in tea. Indian food. Or buffalo wings. And sleep.
2358 2018-10-17 20:14:17 Where is the Oil supply going to come from with the Iran sanctions looming and Venezuela not able to supply as much Oil as they used to?
2359 2018-10-17 20:14:15 I personally ride a motorcycle. Ask anyone who rides, there is a level of alertness a rider has on the road a car guy cannot get close to. Where is the sun? Will the glare affect my visibility? Is that oil/water on the road, will I brake? Is this guy behind about to ram? Skills.
2360 2018-10-17 20:14:12 Nigga said “oil changes and tire rotations are free.” Hell they should be just like BMW does b’c that’s the note he’s paying.
2361 2018-10-17 20:14:10 Back on track? Didn’t you guys give away all Alberta’s oil revenues to foreign companies? Weren’t you in charge for 30 years before we hit the oil bust? Then y’all jump ship, leave the NDP holding the bag and now you want to do it again?
2362 2018-10-17 20:14:02 Please dont use your car one lol. Get a 2 ton or 2.5 ton jack and some jack stands. Its going to be a lil money now but in the future when you gotta change a tire or something on the did of the road you gone thank yourself. They also sell the pan,oil, filter and some towels too.
2363 2018-10-17 20:14:02 stop protecting your oil buddies in S.A. We do not want our country to be complicit in the silencing/murdering of journalists.
2364 2018-10-17 20:14:01 Not enough production capacity in US to offset loss of Iranian and Saudi oil any time soon.
2365 2018-10-17 20:13:57 Very sad but true. We Americans developed their oil fields. Now their powerful position in the Middle East is preventing us from punishing them severely for any wrongdoing. We will find a way it may not be obvious or immediate but it will happen. shhhhh
2366 2018-10-17 20:13:50 Yes there are, and if you are sincerely interested in learning the facts, I have no doubt you will google them.
2367 2018-10-17 20:13:35 Yup, I've seen it. And tried by myself before.
But anyway, I might try doing such a test, not sure though if I want to risk adding Mg powder into oil.
Also, I couldn't find any reasonably accurate data on dependency of residual water in molten NaOH from temperature.
2368 2018-10-17 20:13:32 Wat is oil?
2369 2018-10-17 20:13:32 Give him some hemp oil Ashley. Couple drops 2 times a day.
2370 2018-10-17 20:13:29 Organic oregano oil. But be warned!!! It's the Devil's spawn.
2371 2018-10-17 20:13:05 Dawns a G. She can change oil then do a photo shoot right after it with the nugget in the womb. Probably gives her even more extra super powers or sum too.

2377 2018-10-17 20:12:28 You'd rather your tax dollars be used to kill children in other countries than to feed American children, because that's what we do.

2388 2018-10-17 20:11:57 Trump specifically said he didn’t want to upset the Saudis or they can reduce oil supply sending oil prices skyrocketing. Oil now is relatively cheap at $70 barrel but the Saudis can control that
2389 2018-10-17 20:11:57 I only use water based inside and oil outside. Old school mainly Sandtex Flexi I’ve used it for 15 years. The system goes 10 years so no 2-3 and nothing left to get back and fleece the customers
2390 2018-10-17 20:11:54 Seriously? This man has all the political acumen of a herring and the credibility of a snake oil salesman. Why are you asking him anything?
2391 2018-10-17 20:11:48 Good to know, thank you. Just started looking into CBD oil for some health issues. That also looks promising. Might wait for the price to come down since no insurance covers it yet.
2392 2018-10-17 20:11:47 Blended Biofuels have been in use in aircraft since 2011. Facts. Matter.

2398 2018-10-17 20:11:14 Saudi Arabia attacked New York, have spread violent wasabism - despicable, violent theocracy & patriarchy - just say no to your OIL pusher - show som3 dignity folks
2399 2018-10-17 20:10:50 Jack and kick, shakabula , pistol harba ka lape
2400 2018-10-17 20:10:47 Beautiful writing! Here’s another Indian recipe: oil + shallots + cumin + ground coriander + ground chillies + turmeric + sliced okra. Salt right towards the end.
2401 2018-10-17 20:10:41 Yep. We're an oil-based economy, and the Saudi's have the oil. A no-brainer, as they say.
2402 2018-10-17 20:10:37 My wife asked me "If we are the WORLD'S LARGEST Producers of OIL WHY ARE WE PAYING ALMOST $3.00 per gallon of GASOLINE?!" I told her it is BECAUSE we have ONLY FIVE (5) REFINERS in ALL of the USA! This was done to PROMOTE "ETHANOL" the BIGGEST "BOONDOGGLE" in History.
2403 2018-10-17 20:10:33 Have we tried to ask ourselves how we have got to such a situation where people are crazy over cooking oil. I am trying to understand
2404 2018-10-17 20:10:29 @realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump!!Not Submit you to Saudi Arabia.
You should organize UN Military under the agreement of the other four nations, UK,France,Russia,China.UN Military should occupy Saudi Arabia.UN should govern Saudi Arabia,and decide on OIL PRICE and so on.
2405 2018-10-17 20:10:27 As a veteran and an oil producer in Texas y’all have No idea of how hard it was under HUSSEIN Obama to make oil and stay in biz. Thank God for Trump!!!

2407 2018-10-17 20:10:18 As much as we hate the Glazers no United fan should be happy about this.
If we get bought out by a consistent Human Rights violator that just has oil money then we as bad as the joke of a club we always shite on about.
Imagine going from JP McManus to this shite.
2408 2018-10-17 20:10:04 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2409 2018-10-17 20:09:59 this last move in oil was correlated with equities, I would be careful to short it, unless this correlation vanishes
2410 2018-10-17 20:09:40 The golden age of the 60's and 70's
The country awash with jobs in manufacturing, mining and oil
A family only needed 1 bread-winner to provide a good standard of living

Back in the 80's, I remember Roger supported Thatcher 
She implemented the end of the "Golden Age"
2411 2018-10-17 20:09:36 And how do you afford any other depth players?
2412 2018-10-17 20:09:35 How exactly will that change Saudi Arabia’s behaviour? We have no way of getting that oil to our refineries? No Common Sense as usual.
2413 2018-10-17 20:09:29 @jackiekabler can you ask Keeley whether you should put on an oil before serum please
2414 2018-10-17 20:09:28 so many requests - I vote for oil, nat gas and /es
2415 2018-10-17 20:09:25 Obama was the one with a RED line remember Tappy. 

Current POTUS is not a lead from behind administration.  

We produce more oil than they do now. We're not hostages anymore 

Take it or leave it is how it is now
2416 2018-10-17 20:09:17 Don Jr. is donating the proceeds from selling the oil in his hair to the Saudis to the campaign. 
2417 2018-10-17 20:09:07 As a hairstylist, overwashing is bad, but how often you should wash is determined by many factors like texture, density and scalp condition. Straight hair can be washed more often because the oil travels down the shaft easier than curly hair. The product used makes a big diff 2.
2418 2018-10-17 20:08:57 I wonder how many people besides me can see the libs are all but begging @realDonaldTrump to start trouble with the saudies to make oil prices rise and slow the economy. Hmmm
2419 2018-10-17 20:08:52 And how do you pay for that and have elite defense?
2420 2018-10-17 20:08:31 Nov. WTI oil declines by $2.17, or 3%, to settle at $69.75/bbl
2421 2018-10-17 20:08:27 Squeaky wheel gets some oil...sometimes
2422 2018-10-17 20:08:16 Baptize me in olive oil, daddy
2423 2018-10-17 20:08:13 Diddy did not just date Cassie for 11 solid year,

He was busy changing 'Oil' for 11 years...


2424 2018-10-17 20:08:11 What a bunch of bullshitters and hypocrites. They've no problem suckling from and promoting every barbaric middle-eastern regime that can drill oil from the ground. Some scumbags are more equal than others in the eyes of the Nou Camp.
2425 2018-10-17 20:08:10 Go to auto zone and tell them you want to get the parts needed to do an oil change. Tell them what car you have. You’ll need jack stands and a hydraulic jack though.

Depending on your car you might be able to just use the jack in your trunk. (Not the safest route) lol
2426 2018-10-17 20:08:07 I'll give you the Reinhart trade and concede that maybe we could have gotten a little extra for hall, but Chiarelli was really only gifted a couple of blue chip trade pieces and Hall was never gonna be a league mvp with mcdavid here.
2427 2018-10-17 20:08:05 Did you get oil on your hands when you shook that slimebags tiny hands?
2428 2018-10-17 20:08:02 Chávez was every bit as authoritarian and incompetent as his successor Maduro. He was just luckier in that oil prices were much higher during his cleptocratic and extremely corrupt period.
2429 2018-10-17 20:07:51 you can’t outsmart me. i eat omega fish oil.
2430 2018-10-17 20:07:49 I started taking October,Jan I s sow the results beyond expectations . Obviously I used coconut oil and hair masks as well.
2431 2018-10-17 20:07:41 Ameen Ameen, you know how companies are
2432 2018-10-17 20:07:38 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
2433 2018-10-17 20:07:28 This is Putin's plan because Russia depends upon high oil prices and they are using Russian agent/pawn to fulfil their dreams
2434 2018-10-17 20:07:24 Jacque trying to cover aka jowie is the reason why she's in boiling oil. You are guilty of murder until proven innocent.
2435 2018-10-17 20:07:23 A better bet is two devastating forward pairs in 97/93 and 29 and you-know-who.

Good drafting and value contracts are needed regardless. They aren't excuses for pissing away assets in trades. Especially elite ones.
2436 2018-10-17 20:07:20 #solo #AEX  both have 25% of 126 million barrels of oil 2C equivalent and the next drill targets another 150 million barrels giip.

solo mcap = £14.7 million
AEX = £65 million and with a $40 million cash and carry

25% each of 2.5 $billion resource @ current resource sales price
2437 2018-10-17 20:07:19 #JamalKhashoggi #MurderousBloodySavages Trump’s new standard for assessing human rts violations by “allies”: “If you buy enuf stuff from us (gross of oil sales)...and are not China, RU, or Israel...u can kill any journo you like..” #ShadyArabia
2438 2018-10-17 20:07:18 I wonder what scenario will eventually emerge: Idiocracy or Handmaid’s Tale? Meanwhile, I’ll be in England eating rats and trading firewood for black market heating oil and tinned food.
2439 2018-10-17 20:07:15 Perhaps you misunderstand me. I vote no on 112. The purpose of Prop 112 is to end new oil and gas development in Colorado and that will definitely cost us jobs.
2440 2018-10-17 20:07:13 of course an ally...US is supporting SA to maim & murder in Yemen, Bush/SA orchestrated 9/11 as justification for illegal invasion of Iraq & Afghanistan...oil, gas, power buddies
2441 2018-10-17 20:07:01 There are many (decent) English people living in Aberdeen who are of the sort who classify themselves as British. They do not want an independent Scotland. That would mean an increase in taxes on them and the oil business. Same for Corbyn led labour part.
2442 2018-10-17 20:06:57 Use beard oil

2445 2018-10-17 20:06:40 I'm not certain this did you many favors. It didn't discuss Beto's record. He voted against a bill that would effectively ban abortions in Texas. The $10 tax was to be paid by oil companies - not consumers. Harvey bill funded some health, but not CHIP- set to expire. #LyinTed

2447 2018-10-17 20:06:36 bro, peddling conspiracy theories is the childish thing here. I'm just being mean, as the crazy people like you drag the rest of society down with your weak minds. Can't critical think. Buys the snake oil from .net conspiracy sites. You're a waste to society.
2448 2018-10-17 20:06:35 With tax rate cut for US wealthy & Corps he has to borrow from banks, sustain/create more wars & tension in ME,  to sell arms, push oil prices up, then soon get hold of our NHS, perhaps arm our police force & export cheap low quality food to the UK! Damn!
2449 2018-10-17 20:06:34 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dismembered before they murdered him?  Fuck that shit, don't want anything to do with them. We can get by  without their oil.

2451 2018-10-17 20:06:24 I cannot help there, was hoping a few year old Chevy, I know why those burn oil x3
2452 2018-10-17 20:06:02 crushed raw garlic let it sit for about 5 min after crushing it then eat. oil of oregano is good as well

2454 2018-10-17 20:05:55 Just eating my feelings with the free snacks at my car dealership while getting an oil change, what about you?
2455 2018-10-17 20:05:51 Why are you posting propaganda about oil and gas?
2456 2018-10-17 20:05:36 Hhhhhh. You should help her with the recipe i guess
2457 2018-10-17 20:05:35 The whole album is loosely centered around wars for oil but once you generalize that it's a straightforward capitalist narrative...because that's what a war for oil is.

Anyway, I was much less smart back then.
2458 2018-10-17 20:05:35 Jeez. CBD oil at the naturals store in Boston is priced absurdly. $70 for a 700mg bottle?? I paid like $30 for a 600mg bottle in NH
2459 2018-10-17 20:05:30 Nationalism all Saudi royal family assets. Cut off funding for them and let Yemen run them over. Pump all the oil out on us airbases.
2460 2018-10-17 20:05:26 I totally gave my son that haircut he payed me back stalling the car moving off junction with massive Esso oil truck heading straight towards us 
2461 2018-10-17 20:05:22 I have considered that but didn’t want to get oil on the belts and perish them. If it is the alternator I’d have thought it would be bearings inside it causing the issue.
2462 2018-10-17 20:05:17 Yeah you have to remove the filter in order to drain the old oil. They’re often on pretty tight, may need a wrench to loosen it.
2463 2018-10-17 20:05:15 I usually shower in the morning and throw in some oil, let the curls take over and keep it down. Or throw it in a braid  still forever wearing leggings and comfy Ts though
2464 2018-10-17 20:05:14 Stop the Drama.
Simple fix. 
Swap out their Opium stash with Crystal Meth.
 Hooked in days... They'll be eat'n out of our hands & be broke in record time.
And they'll be so wired They'll be pumping oil by trillions of gal
2465 2018-10-17 20:05:11 Get that cbd oil, expensive but a girl in work had bad back and swears by it.3 drops on tongue and happy days.
2466 2018-10-17 20:05:10 Pure Evil!! Sickening!! Time to cut them off and prosecute!! We have enough oil to sustain us!!
2467 2018-10-17 20:05:03 Jamie, why can't you get it into you're thick skull they need us more than we need them? Perhaps we might just stop supplying them with electricity for a while or turn off the oil taps going to their refineries. Just thinking out loud, you should try it?
2468 2018-10-17 20:04:59 There's a ugandan Nutritionist called christine Anyumel,she has an organisation called Healing Naturally together.She has pure castor oil(Ugandan btw).

2470 2018-10-17 20:04:47 Yeah there is, from a different firm tho
2471 2018-10-17 20:04:40 Trading your second best player for a second pair defensive D man will never be defensible business. Neither is dealing two picks for Reinhart.

"Fixing roster holes" does not mean "at any cost".  The team is weakened because of such reckless, incompetent management by Chiarelli.
2472 2018-10-17 20:04:32 AMERICA SHOULD NEVER CONDONE MURDER NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY COMMITED IT. ESPECIALLY FOR MONEY OR CONTROL THE OIL..WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM FOSSIL OIL, BECAUE WW3 IS COMING.

2474 2018-10-17 20:04:23 CA will prevent wild fires (?!?) right after OK, NE, IL, IA...  prevent tornadoes, & miami prevents floods, & MN & MI prevent blizzards, &...

and pipelines & offshore drillers prevent even 1 drop of oil from leaking
2475 2018-10-17 20:04:20 Oil changes for a non foreign car is at minimum $20 every 3-4 months. Is he ok? 
2476 2018-10-17 20:04:12 If the US is the largest oil and gas producer,,,, then why is Trump blaming OPEC for the US gas prices? Asking for a friend......
2477 2018-10-17 20:03:58 I used to oil the chain on my old girlfriend’s huffy back in the day everyday before she left for work 
2478 2018-10-17 20:03:53 A structural engineer is in the team?
2479 2018-10-17 20:03:51 @JennaJulien next podcast idea: Snake Oil, but with cards that you wrote down
2480 2018-10-17 20:03:42 How is a pipeline polluting the environment more than shipping oil by train or shipping BC coal to China and Japan?
2481 2018-10-17 20:03:36 i also learned that you need different oil for colder regions in your car and there’s just so many things about having a car i don’t know bc i lived in hot land my whole life
2482 2018-10-17 20:03:33 The world’s oil industry is a relatively small “fraternity.”  The Bin Laden family are relatively “normal” people.  Osama was a black sheep and shunned.  No way would Bush harbor the rotten SOB regardless of knowing the family IMHO.
2483 2018-10-17 20:03:31 Y'all do realize that the USA is the world's largest oil producer, right?
...because you'd look pretty ignorant if you didn't understand that oil price increases benefit the largest oil producer the most.
2484 2018-10-17 20:03:14 Growth oil makes your nails grow mad fast  I love this stuff juss wish it would work faster in my hair
2485 2018-10-17 20:03:10 Our state government has issues, y'all. They refuse to fund K-12 schools & shove the burden onto cities. They refuse to let cities determine & enforce appropriate restrictions on oil & gas development. They waste our pathetically short legislative sessions fighting culture wars--
2486 2018-10-17 20:03:09 It's the oil. 

As long as the us depends on Saudi Arabia to keep oil prices down and sell oil for the US dollar. Then our Government wont take serious action against them.
2487 2018-10-17 20:03:08 Ted Cruz said O'Rourke voted in favor of $10/barrel for oil producted in TX. Beto said Cruz was being dishonest, but fact checkers say Cruz is correct. So Beto is lying about his own record. #CruzCrew #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #MAGA #TheRainMakers #PatriotsUnited #WWG1WGA
2488 2018-10-17 20:03:05 Hahaha not true at all. The ‘oil’ money is in the hands of the 1%.
2489 2018-10-17 20:03:00 Of course if a Suni Arab kills a reporter in the desert we got ban the MusLums...round em up kick em out

If a Suni Arab with an Italian table cloth on their head kills a journalist in a Saudi embassy... we gotta worry about winning the arms race and keeping oil at 65 a barrel.
2490 2018-10-17 20:02:39 Natural gas and Oil Development by USA - is soft power that prevents us from having to go to war and drop MOAB - Mother of ALL Bombs.  Best line of defense against Islamism and Russia.   Cheaper than missiles and the blood of Americans and innocents.
2491 2018-10-17 20:02:22 Whilst the evil enacted on #JamalKhashoggi is rightfully condemned worldwide, Saudis have been murdering thousands in Yemen with the complicity of the UK. We are making money from this slaughter. Aside from climate change, another reason to be freed from the overreliance on oil
2492 2018-10-17 20:02:17 As I see it there's groups who dislike him for various unfair reasons, some even like 'Green'-ideals but dislike Musk because he's a businessman who leads the way largely outside of gov; others with old-space, defense contractor, oil, auto industry or other conflicting interests.
2493 2018-10-17 20:02:13 That is nonsense! It is about weapons and oil. Nothing to do about fighting #terrorism #TrumpLies
2494 2018-10-17 20:02:11 Third Largest and the Second Largest Exporter. Oil Production seems to have peaks and Nat Gas production rates are increasing to offset the shift. They have been producing NatGas since the 60s though.
2495 2018-10-17 20:02:07 They are pretty easy. Just find the puddle of oil.  Lol

2497 2018-10-17 20:01:58 "A very important ally" does NOT take advantage of U & threaten the world eco with, "oil prices will skyrocket" or "strap U2 a $200-300 oil/ barrel" rhetoric, EVERYTIME U disclose the truth about a State sanctioned assasination. This is NOT an ally 2B trusted; it's a convenience.

2499 2018-10-17 20:01:45 Exactly, for example, Epidiolex, the cbd “medication” that was recently  approved cost 32k per year. Full spectrum hemp oil would not only be more effective for the seizure conditions Epidiolex is meant for, but literally one tenth the cost. the greed is unreal
2500 2018-10-17 20:01:44 It's ALWAYS been about the oil and other resources.  For decades.  I wish we'd get this Algae biofuel rolling....
2501 2018-10-17 20:01:41 Did the same with the drz before I have the big bore kit in had no loss in power really but just drank oil. Tho spec is 1L per 1k miles hahaha so basically 2 stroke
2502 2018-10-17 20:01:39 Since it’s your first I would lease and here’s why: you get a better warranty, a trade in value on a used car is virtually nothing later with a leased car you haven’t put much in. As long as you stay under the mileage agreement your good. & I think most  include oil changes.
2503 2018-10-17 20:01:33 This highlights the importance of the US- and all Western democracies- to them. That vast wealth they have comes from one source- oil. Other than oil their only export is terrorists. Plus the recruits for terrorism they've created with the devastation they've brought to Yemen.

2506 2018-10-17 20:01:19 It's the oil.

As long as the House of Saud can swing the price of oil like they can, and decide to stop trading oil in US dollars. Then they have significant sway over US Govt.

2512 2018-10-17 20:00:57 Why? I go every year to Spain France Italy and the price goes up every year, there only need to be a spike in the oil price because the Arab's decides to cut production and our holidays go up by more than Brexit would cost, No Vince doing the Scaremongering thing. Don't work.
2513 2018-10-17 20:00:47 Let's put this on the Wikipedia page at the very least so 100 years from now, others look at it the way we look at medieval woodblock prints with people being boiled alive in pots of oil because they stole a horse or something.
2514 2018-10-17 20:00:36 The US has had an important national interest in Saudi Arabia since 9/11. And it is not oil, it’s not arms sales, it’s not standing up to Iran. It’s Islamic religious reform, which can come only from Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam’s holiest cities, Mecca and Medina.
2515 2018-10-17 20:00:34 Air popped - No oil, less calories. Win-win.

2520 2018-10-17 20:00:17 Shucks... The two burner should get oil hot enough.. Maybe the hot plate.. It will just take a little longer to pop? I'd try it... I've used   similar equipment when I rented a room.
2521 2018-10-17 20:00:12 Well yes, Sweden was asked to share the oil once in the 70th but our leader Palme declined! V smart. Still, why need an expensive EU to have good relation and deals? How much do you pay to include in Eu?
2522 2018-10-17 20:00:08 LOL I think they are big into oil
2523 2018-10-17 20:00:02 More like, do you use a spatula to splash the oil on top of the egg #justpinoythings

2528 2018-10-17 19:59:42 Oil.
2529 2018-10-17 19:59:28 Nigerians are hilarious, as I went to ask how much kickback was obtained from these, people don first me ask 
2530 2018-10-17 19:59:27 Deliver enough supplies they won't drip their saliva for that cooking oil, the scarcity of that commodity is now making you kings of Israel.
2531 2018-10-17 19:59:25 Haha mega oil companies panicking...
2532 2018-10-17 19:59:22 ليس من أجل الاسراف او التباهي @oil_shaeikh @Utility6151 @angry_ustaaz
2533 2018-10-17 19:59:15 America get the oil from Canada and South america.  Election is over get with it try again  next election.  2 year you try to bring him down with no success.  Sick of it.  God Bless MAGA PRESIDENT.
2534 2018-10-17 19:59:04 One way to deal with the Saudi terrorists (masquerading as a government) - Clean renewable energy.  

They produce more oil than any country on earth - as a matter of national security we should stop using oil
2535 2018-10-17 19:58:57 Will di if wi find wan cheap enuff even charity shops r dear coz o oil tax  even thou it's a slump o noo
2536 2018-10-17 19:58:45 Hey Jason, 

Please take your fascist ideologies and go away. The oil boom and the associated demographic change has made your xenophobic, rascist & authoritarian ideals irrelevant in Alberta.

Your oil booms and cycles have caused this. All of it. Evolve.
2537 2018-10-17 19:58:42 Yup, and with a generational talent your best bet for secondary offense is good drafting and cheap elc's which are coming
2538 2018-10-17 19:58:34 Their entire business model is based on people dressing up and acting like someone they are not.
2539 2018-10-17 19:58:16 At this point it's safe to say that all women, regardless of education, race, etc., would rather see Trump run over with an oil taker truck before voting for him. That said, there are a few exceptions in the gene pool who have convinced themselves he's "special".
2540 2018-10-17 19:58:08 Hey dude, you wouldn’t happen to have any of that beard oil would you?
2541 2018-10-17 19:57:52 Does it seem like I'm defending him? I'm saying he was one actor in a much larger deception, where ALL actors are probably laughing at us. No other explanation makes sense. Why do we still do business with SAR's? Our leaders are too susceptible to OIL and the rarity of WEALTH.
2542 2018-10-17 19:57:45 DanAllah 
2543 2018-10-17 19:57:44 I recommend oil cartridges  #gangstershit
2544 2018-10-17 19:57:39 Did not get the sample kam?
And those new bottles are a pain to get the tops off
Infact i am in a mess with one .oil or over the carpet
2545 2018-10-17 19:57:38 Not sure if petrodollars flowing thro banks in the global north also contributed to inflation there (alongside debt in the south). But feels like there's something in this re contingency of oil price shocks both undermining Kenyesian model plus turbocharging financialisation.
2546 2018-10-17 19:57:27 I need to get an oil change but my bank account says no
2547 2018-10-17 19:57:15 Oh, yes, but most of them are either hot-air (I like the oil kind) or absurdly expensive (at least for *my* budget, lol). The fun ones, of course, are those big ones that pop movie-theater-style, but who has room for one of those?!? LOL!
2548 2018-10-17 19:57:12 thank god for tea tree oil.
and tea trees.
and earth.
2549 2018-10-17 19:57:09 Spray and oil is better anyway.
2550 2018-10-17 19:57:03 Does an oil change count as self care
2551 2018-10-17 19:57:00 Obama shoots down excuses, urges people to vote in midterm elections in new video. Coconut oil would help his hair stay black.

...omg fallout is real isn’t it?
2557 2018-10-17 19:56:24 The D is missing an elite offensive RD, the rarest of all species in NHL. Chia drafted one in Bouchard, just isn't ready to be elite yet. Wing depth will be better than before with what is here now in 1-2 years time without making another move. Prospects take time.
2558 2018-10-17 19:56:18 There is so much more to Turkey than is reported. Turkey are demonized whilst Saudi is constantly defended. Turkey doesn’t have as much oil as Saudi. No one does. You should visit Istanbul sometime, greatest city in the world.
2559 2018-10-17 19:56:18 Sana oil walang sakit noh! Para lahat nakakagalaw ng maayos
2560 2018-10-17 19:56:18 Oh shit, well get one of those bottles with a skinny top thingy (idk what it’s called) & fill it with oil. Use it to oil your scalp through the braids.
2561 2018-10-17 19:56:14 Too high to be getting the oil changed 
2562 2018-10-17 19:55:59 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
2563 2018-10-17 19:55:48 Really, really wouldn't miss another spoiled, murderous oil prince, either.
2564 2018-10-17 19:55:48 It was great to speak at the @NGAgraphene at the Global Graphene Expo on the use if #graphene in the #oilandgas industry. Exciting to see this new product in #energy production space.

#oil #natgas
2565 2018-10-17 19:55:33 Venezuela seems shit at the moment, perhaps a view of Britain post Brexit, so why don’t we trade shit loads of food and basic goods we can produce for loads of cheap oil? #brexitupside
2566 2018-10-17 19:55:25 Sure, we still need defense but what we have is way better than what was here before. Shoring it up was the number one priority and what do you trade to do that? We had a ton of good offensive players but a bunch of ahl d-men.
2567 2018-10-17 19:55:21 Do I eat or do I buy Vitamin E Oil? Eat or E Oil?????......ok
... E Oil it is....
2568 2018-10-17 19:55:07 Utter Animals. What are the odds that so much of the worlds oil ends up under such a bunch of medievals . Buy electric cars everyone
2569 2018-10-17 19:55:07 Tax cuts aren’t enough to save a dying company. And that’s normal, tax cuts wouldn’t have saved the horse carriage industry when ford invented the car, and a lot of oil companies went out of business when Edison invented the light bulb
2570 2018-10-17 19:55:01 Plus side no need to change the oil it's all new anyway! 
2571 2018-10-17 19:54:55 @RobBreakenridge this canard of replacing Saudi Oil with AB oil (mostly dilbit) is silly. Eastern refineries are not configured to use AB oil. They can be configured for dilbit but at great coat to the refiners.

2573 2018-10-17 19:54:44 Tory assumes a US/Cuba trade relationship post Indy. Hate suspicion and fear. Needs to explain why he thinks that, when rUK needs water, electricity and to some extent, oil, from us.
2574 2018-10-17 19:54:37 Pienso terminar de hacerle Retrofit, aunque la cambie en un futuro, la tendré ahí para otras cosas, ya que también gasta poco Oil.
2575 2018-10-17 19:54:33 #MBS and the Saudi king and many others of the corrupt, fanatical, #Religionist royal family know full well how to manipulate the oil- dependent, infidel, doomed & thus ok to kill, big powers -- whether it's 3000 WTC dwellers or one naive journalist.
2576 2018-10-17 19:54:21 Sorry i tot ur team has history.... 

Just remembered u came into existence during d oil boom
2577 2018-10-17 19:54:20 Having lived there they couldn’t give two hoots and they can just turn off the oil
2578 2018-10-17 19:54:14 You mean Roosevelt agreeing to protect the Saudi Regime in exchange for Oil?
2579 2018-10-17 19:54:14 Do a good protein treatment & a hot oil treatment!
2580 2018-10-17 19:54:10 Fish oil; Fish Brain food? Blue-Green Alga eaten by NASA Astronauts? The trend is that Blue -Green Alga PROMOTES INTELLIGENCE. Today you're saying it causes Alzheimer's & Parkinson's, etc. Correlation not causation? This is why we should work together.
2581 2018-10-17 19:53:55 But can we push back against that standard narrative more by looking  at the oil price shocks from a different angle, i.e. how petrodollars from oil exporting countries flowing into commercial banks helped boost financialisation/eurodollar markets.
2582 2018-10-17 19:53:54 right.  Every time you buy gas money goes to Iran as long as Iranian oil is in the world supply
2583 2018-10-17 19:53:52 Hopefully the Canadian public won’t fall for pretty face again. Especially after seeing how pretty boy spent all our money, put us very deep in debt , killed our oil industry and let jihads in our country. #cdnpoli
2584 2018-10-17 19:53:50 10 minutes into watching Salt Fat Acid Heat in bed and I start crying. How on earth is this show about olive oil and making focaccia so incredibly, unexpectedly moving??
2585 2018-10-17 19:53:40 The same reason the USA and Israel have been lurking in the shadows of oil rich nations , they wait to install a puppet government
2586 2018-10-17 19:53:28 @subaru_usa how do I get the oil drain plug off without stripping the head on my 2018 crosstrek? Seems to be a common issue for us at home mechanics.
2587 2018-10-17 19:52:56 The Saudis are threatening to raise the price of oil to $400 a barrel if any sanctions are placed on them! That's some major blackmail! It could wreck our economy so quickly we won't know what hit us! Another reason 4 a move 2 clean energy!
2588 2018-10-17 19:52:44 Zomi oil or what ?
2589 2018-10-17 19:52:21 Qatar has the worlds largest single reserve of LNG , its future is not reliant on oil .
2590 2018-10-17 19:52:07 Will go drink 25 liters of Palm oil
2591 2018-10-17 19:52:06 My hood's transformer got oil busted yesterday. We have a newly formed neighbourhood watch unit guardung the corpse now lol
2592 2018-10-17 19:52:03 Sure. But the assumption being made here is that Connor is the ONLY reason that the Oilers have indeed improved since he took over. Talbot. Sekera (great in 16-17, injuries since). Russell (love him or hate him, he's an upgrade over what existed before). Chia's adds have helped
2593 2018-10-17 19:51:50 Enjoyed this! Slightly random point, but I liked your emphasis on the contingency of the 1970s transition, i.e. how inflationary pressures of oil price shocks helped undermine the old Keynesian policy regime (wh/ also gets us away from the standard narrative of blaming unions).
2594 2018-10-17 19:51:47 Yeah, and considering what he started with for assets and needs and where they are now, has he built a good team around 97?

The same needs (defense) exist. What was the strength (wings) has been eroded.

Net negative.
2595 2018-10-17 19:51:35 Exactly any nation that wants to provide some sort of future for its citizens should be seriously looking at ways to break their oil addiction. The Pompeo comment saying didn’t want to discuss the facts, wtf was he there for so

2605 2018-10-17 19:49:49 the answer is simple... solar, wind, hydro energy!  stop this dependence on oil, coal and natural gas!
2606 2018-10-17 19:49:47 He probably doesn't have a single technical skill either, doesn't mow the lawn and can't change your oil. This new era "man" is something else. "Call the plumber" lmbo s I tell you. 
2607 2018-10-17 19:49:40 at the peak of summer, perhaps with an oil that is lightly spicy... #ArgentinaHighWines #TWC1017
2608 2018-10-17 19:49:38 Oil?
2609 2018-10-17 19:49:17 "Obama needed the Saudis to lower oil prices to bleed Putin off of the Crimean Peninsula" which clearly didn't work. And hundreds of thousands of Yemenis (if not millions) are and about to pay with their lives.
Trump is a POS. Obama should've known better.
2610 2018-10-17 19:49:15 North Dakota tribes are, generally, awash in oil money.  Why couldn’t they (or the State) find $100k?  Calling all Republicans vote suppressors was cute, tho.
2611 2018-10-17 19:49:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
2612 2018-10-17 19:49:11 I do olive oil but thanks ima try vitamin e now
2613 2018-10-17 19:49:11 How do you know they haven’t planned for increased oil prices leading to higher electric car sales. They own 3-5 percent of TSLA and have a stake in at least one more electric car maker.
2614 2018-10-17 19:49:07 Putting a price, or tax, on carbon is as far as one can get from finding gold, or oil. Those who claim that putting a price, or tax, on carbon winds up making the economy stronger are more sincere, or delusional, than logical.
2615 2018-10-17 19:49:07 Damn right! Need the oil and jobs from arms deal!

2627 2018-10-17 19:48:15 @JustinWelby, was an executive of British oil company in Nigeria during the time of #Buhar as PTF chairman. He still has oil well in Nigeria. Now he is wearing clergy clothe to deceive Nigerians into thinking he is a servant of God so that they continue sucking them dry.
2628 2018-10-17 19:48:15 Let Saudi Arabia cut production, it’s high time that we start producing our own oil, we have tons of deposits in North America.
2629 2018-10-17 19:48:10 it's 3%... and most of those are funded by the oil industry. We know carbon dioxide traps heat. No one denies this. It's a replicable experiment. Plus, all the weather data (heat waves, record storms) proves climate science correct year in and year out.
2630 2018-10-17 19:48:03 So cooking oil is really ‘gold’ in Zimbabwe 
2631 2018-10-17 19:48:02  #Norway has plenty of oil and plenty of gold.
2632 2018-10-17 19:47:54 Olive oil?
2633 2018-10-17 19:47:51 Nice column!   I was wondering why oil was projected to go up 20% ( :O )

Apparently, the competition with maritime fuels.  :(
2634 2018-10-17 19:47:46 If  you eat a bunch of spicy food it'll clear your nose or  sniff peppermint oil

2636 2018-10-17 19:47:40 As is the short sightedness of so many! Why oh why are MPs not taking an honest stance on the issues which will affect individuals so markedly! #tipoftheiceberg #noresponserequired #iknowtheansweralready 
2637 2018-10-17 19:47:28 It's oil money that funds Islamist #Terrorism,at its heart is Saudi Arabia,so when you sit in your car,stuck in traffic,think about that.
2638 2018-10-17 19:47:26 Even if you have just handled oil or poision
2639 2018-10-17 19:47:12 Not “backed”. It’s the petrodollar effect.  The oil bourse exchange. If the USD stops being exchanged in oil transactions, there are a lot of negatives effects.
2640 2018-10-17 19:47:06 True, but we need to evaluate the GM based on where he's made a tangible impact. Trades, signings, and draft decisions outside of that one extremely obvious one in 2015.

(Translation: a GM shouldn't get bonus points for drafting Connor Freaking McDavid)

2644 2018-10-17 19:46:13 Are those national team football players being given cooking oil?
2645 2018-10-17 19:46:10 I also understand that some see SA as a key ally in the ME, as well as oil. But let's be honest, why do we want to be tied up with oil considerations? Domestic producers can replace it, or, better yet, solar. Call their bluff, they don't have the market share to hold firm.
2646 2018-10-17 19:46:01 before nko? he's thinking of the future and the oil and gas men in Rivers state and the cost of the marriage list. Imo state men run at page 4 of 8 list. serious Rivers state men start sweating at page 6 of 8.

2647 2018-10-17 19:45:59 Girls, tell him that, "The rand is trading at 21.50c to the US dollar, R14 to Euro and with R18.50c you could get yourself just one British pound.
The gold is trading at R1560, platinum R750.99c and the Brunt Crude Oil is R14.99c a barrel" !

2649 2018-10-17 19:45:58 because it gets cold.

Where as if you met someone in Miami or Ve gas or Mexico, 

you aren’t as worried about the oil bill or your jacket.
2650 2018-10-17 19:45:42 Agree completely but the Saudi’s have the world over a barrel (excuse the shite pun) when at a whim they can increase the price of oil overnight and cause a global recession
2651 2018-10-17 19:45:37 You sure told him.  He’s probably curled up in the fetal position at the thought of getting blocked by you.
2652 2018-10-17 19:45:37 What LIP OIL IS USED IN THE VID? I MISSED IT
2653 2018-10-17 19:45:37 Yes. However what you don't know is that while the trolley is searching for your friend you mix industrial glue into it's oil, seizing it's engine after it runs over your friend, and hopefully yourself as well.

2656 2018-10-17 19:45:23 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2657 2018-10-17 19:45:19 All this oil I’m putting in my car, i better not have one issue after this and I’m not even playing.
2658 2018-10-17 19:45:06 By the time Veronica gets put in my name she ain’t gon need shit but an oil change
2659 2018-10-17 19:45:04 OML right now i feel like they got the best massages! i ain’t get the clay mask, but i got the hot towels & oil massages & cant wait to go back 
2660 2018-10-17 19:44:53 The sooner we no longer need to rely on oil imports (and all the political bullshit that comes with it) the better.....
2661 2018-10-17 19:44:47 I get to hit the oil field when I’m 18 & that’s literally in 2 months  #BigMoves
2662 2018-10-17 19:44:44 It's similar with Mexico and the oil, we produce it, sell it and buy it back after processing
2663 2018-10-17 19:44:43 Where is you lady of petroleum Diezani oil Lady where is she?
2664 2018-10-17 19:44:40 Everything must be distilled through the prism of grievance studies now apparently. That’s what happens when you take money to peddle snake oil.
2665 2018-10-17 19:44:39 use castor oil too!!
2666 2018-10-17 19:44:38 Oil?
2667 2018-10-17 19:44:35 Oregano oil faster than antibiotics... you must be drunk in a bar. As a healthcare professional that advice is not only absurd it’s downright dangerous. If you develop a serious infection you could go into septic shock and multi-system organ failure. Death is the result.
2668 2018-10-17 19:44:35 So like?? With all the luck in the world im not dead right now?? My cars transmission line was broke and It was leaking transmission fluid. We noticed it yesterday and went to fix it thinking it was oil?? But my mechanic told me if I were to have drove it to work I'd be dead
2669 2018-10-17 19:44:33 Peppermint Oil
2670 2018-10-17 19:44:31 Wikipedia Definition- "Correlation does not imply causation. ... That "correlation proves causation," is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when 2 events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-&-effect relationship." Fish oil; Fish, Brain Food?
2671 2018-10-17 19:44:22 1: Thanks for asking, Donald! All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight.
2672 2018-10-17 19:44:19 Coconut oil every day with your coffee  or tea
2673 2018-10-17 19:44:11 "We are now the LARGEST producer of oil and natural gas IN THE WORLD."  First President to NOT be OWNED by the Saudis in decades.
2674 2018-10-17 19:44:09 Next up I can see CNN saying that hash oil is a substitute for engine oil
2675 2018-10-17 19:44:06 People voted on lies and scaremongering. They lied about The vow,equal partners, shipbuilding,pensions,HMRC jobs,Military bases, NHS ,businesses leaving,oil, The EU etc etc. Even those who voted Brexit were lied to !  Bring on independence!!
2676 2018-10-17 19:44:06 someone that works with my mom makes it. I get that in a 12 oz bottle and a 6 oz raspberry seed oil that I use as my mosturizer for $25 for both
2677 2018-10-17 19:44:03 Yeah, I’m not opposed to pill nor oil if controlled distribution.

It’s the smoked variety that tends to hit the market and not be enforced as strongly (based on experience in AZ and Illinois).
2678 2018-10-17 19:43:56 Yea someone told me that. Infact she insisted that I’m hiding the tea recipes from her
2679 2018-10-17 19:43:53 I swear took two big ass fish oil gels and my whole right hand smell like a fish rn
2680 2018-10-17 19:43:45 If you remove mcdavid from the equation are you also removing his cap hit? Alternate reality indeed
2681 2018-10-17 19:43:41 Me trying to figure out how to do a baby oil video without dying
2682 2018-10-17 19:43:40 Underlying probl that US policy in MEast, ever since WW2 when Fr/Brit colonies came free, was based on access to oil, Cold War, and Israel. 

A balanced approach best (HST, DDE) but flawed: Iran '53 coup bad idea, siding w/ Sunni over Shia a bad idea, abjuring balance v bad idea!
2683 2018-10-17 19:43:35 Pull up in Ranges, fresh oil changes and registration
2684 2018-10-17 19:43:32 Horses and buggies are a threat to both coal and big oil. Elevator operators want $15 an hour.
2685 2018-10-17 19:43:30 Lidl chicken legs for $.79. Multi colored carrots, onions, a tomato, sun dried tomatoes in oil, garlic, baby potatoes, Tuscan herb olive oil, bit chicken stock, italian herbs. Did vinegar & worch sauce in the bottom.  Using what I had!  In All-Clad cooker from the thrift shop.
2686 2018-10-17 19:43:27 But this stuff is very unhealthy why would people fight for cooking oil 
2687 2018-10-17 19:43:10 If essential oils can smell as good as a bath and body works store, I might consider switching to an oil diffuser
2688 2018-10-17 19:43:08 Probably not what you were thinking when he said he wanted to do you in oil....
2689 2018-10-17 19:43:08 And Chiarelli was brought in because they won the draft lottery. Saying "remove mcdavid from the equation" is like Trump claiming he won the popular vote if you remove California. That's not how reality works.
2690 2018-10-17 19:43:03 yes i use oil
2691 2018-10-17 19:43:02 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
2692 2018-10-17 19:42:46 The USA shouldn't worry to much, Canada oil will substitute
2693 2018-10-17 19:42:39 What he wrote/published or about, must have been damaging, or they were attempting to get his source. Odds are, the source was inside the Saudi hierarchy. SUSPEND THEM FROM OPEC, but don't hurt our workers and the Palestinian peace process. No country should buy their oil.
2694 2018-10-17 19:42:34 when you can smell how bad your car needs an oil change #oops #icandoitmyselftoo
2695 2018-10-17 19:42:29 As a shareholder, I'm not frankly interested by your tweets about the oil market. I just want news that you have at last achieved the 1,000 bopd commercial production you said you would some while ago and you have the permit you needed!
2696 2018-10-17 19:42:26 Ordered a drilled and slotted brake kit yesterday to get here on Friday to install on Saturday along with racing oil change just cuz I miss driving my baby
2697 2018-10-17 19:42:26 To me it's not an insult, both are personal preference.
2698 2018-10-17 19:42:15 All renewable jobs and technologies are just about gone in the US and manufacturers split. This pathetic president instead put all his effort in big Oil and Coal. Deficit will hit ONE TRILLION under his watch. We are in big trouble Dwayne
2699 2018-10-17 19:42:09 PA barely has people able to get medical Marijuana, it to my knowledge is also not covered by insurance even when you get prescibed. CBD oil is too expensive for most people who would need to take it daily. 

Brb moving to Canada. 


2700 2018-10-17 19:41:59 Fact: massage with CBD oil makes you feel better than not massaging.
2701 2018-10-17 19:41:56 Need a oil change
2702 2018-10-17 19:41:54 Done this with my paint brushes. Including oil painting brushes.
Let’s all be glad they don’t add too much flavour 
2703 2018-10-17 19:41:50 aloe vera, tea tree oil, sweet almond oil
2704 2018-10-17 19:41:50 Wow going back to riding camels! What an insult 
Is this the best you got ?
Go search when you can eliminate oil dependencey first
2705 2018-10-17 19:41:46 Vitamin E Oil it will save your life!
2706 2018-10-17 19:41:46 Chiarelli drafted McDavid, but he was hired after the Oilers won the lottery. Everyone knew who they were taking. You could argue that Chiarelli inherited McDavid
2707 2018-10-17 19:41:46 Oil and gas aren't subsidised in Canada or the US.
2708 2018-10-17 19:41:40 In just few days you realize what are your limits Mr. Trump. You now better know how to talk about king. Only one threatening statement of king did the trick. (your weapon deals of billion$ with king could be in danger, Oil prices, king's money in your country and and and... )
2709 2018-10-17 19:41:27 Same reason our party was in bed with them , OIL ! Stop prenteding. We need to get rid of the #TwoPartySystem it’s killing  Also need to take a look at LIMITED term limits for ALL government officials. 
2710 2018-10-17 19:41:19 Oud oil >>>

2712 2018-10-17 19:41:12 castor oil!!
2713 2018-10-17 19:41:05 This is a very serious environmental issue. Many consumers avoid palm oil additives.
2714 2018-10-17 19:40:58 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

Tired of fossil fiel(oil) companies and my tax dollar in the Middle East! Fossil fuel emissions are destroying planet

2722 2018-10-17 19:40:24 Seriously? U still pushing the agenda that Iran has anything to do with oil prices? I mean considering the USA is now the world's largest producer. Here is a fact for you straight from someone I know in the business: 
Oil prices are about pure speculation. Nothing more.
2723 2018-10-17 19:40:22 No tax is revenue neutral. More trucks are hauling oil. Their fuel is taxed, while hauling the taxed product from where the fuel came, increasing the price of fuel. The longer pipelines are delayed the more demand for trucks, the more double-taxed fuel is consumed.
2724 2018-10-17 19:40:17 A colleague at work was asking me why Hausa/Fulani ladies are slim with flat tummy, small shoulders, shapy hips, fine face she was going on n on, I was hungry, to cut a long story short I just said its genetics  she was like is there a Tea they usually take
2725 2018-10-17 19:40:12 Lol "with free oil changes for a year"

2727 2018-10-17 19:40:01 Organic Coconut oil is very good for you and you can use it in your food, on your hair and skin. 
Also very good for your brain and fights infections.
2728 2018-10-17 19:39:58 Not one of the grownups in the room! Probably has investments in the oil business!
2729 2018-10-17 19:39:56 I think Venezuela oil reserves plus them going off the dollar would make it profitable enough for Russia and China to get involved. Maybe.
2730 2018-10-17 19:39:56 What is engine oil oxidation? Go to our dedicated Amsoil Facebook and find out. Like our page and share with your friends that might be interested. MadJack Synthetics
2731 2018-10-17 19:39:49 Well it still is dirty oil money but I’d rather be owned by someone rich and with the right intentions for the club. Can’t fault the city owner to be honest.
2732 2018-10-17 19:39:48 It’s sooo backwards I don’t get it. It’s really sad especially for those elderly people or those who can’t smoke who take edibles or pills won’t be able to. Those kids who use cbd oil for seizures won’t be able to access it. I’m hoping that changes.
2733 2018-10-17 19:39:40 The evidence was doctored,manufactured from anothers the intelligence service from US and Israel, with support from Qatar!!!
Why?!!!
It's simplu, Trump is created this crisis for Saudi Arabia for oil and the power sobre this country!
And Putin knew!!!!
2734 2018-10-17 19:39:37 l'huile / oil
2735 2018-10-17 19:39:35 Until #Saudi_Arabia has run out of oil, we will be in bed with them.

They own the #Republican & #Democrat party. 

Washington has been sold to for oil decades ago.
2736 2018-10-17 19:39:30 That's the thing, it's not about oil anymore. The UK gets 20x more oil from Norway than it does from Saudi Arabia, the US gets 4x more from Canada than from SA. It's about money. SA buys a lot of arms from the UK and US. Our government traded any morals they had for cash.
2737 2018-10-17 19:39:29 I went full pelt on them, GIVE ME OIL IN MY LAMP KEEP IT BURNING.
2738 2018-10-17 19:39:22 Plus, they don’t bare any of the burden of the hundreds of billions of dollars of health issues that pollutants cause annually. Oil. Isn’t. Cheap.

Oil. Is. More. Expensive. Than. Sustainable/Renewable. Energy.
2739 2018-10-17 19:39:22 @OurRevolution endorses 2 Colorado ballot initiatives.YES on #111, to reduce the Predatory Lending interest rate, and YES on #112 for 2500 ft setbacks for new oil and gas drilling. Ballots are being mailed out this week. We're proud to defend a Fair Shake for People &+Environment
2740 2018-10-17 19:39:21 Blockaid Sadi Arabia's, Oil Ports.Those ppl are just Animals, if they didn't have oil, They'd be useless.
2741 2018-10-17 19:39:08 Olive oil is a tad moist haha
2742 2018-10-17 19:39:07 smoke point, bruh. at higher heats (e.g., boiling+), use avocado oil instead
2743 2018-10-17 19:39:04 Our power went out yesterday and now our heater smells like oil, so it hasn't been on T . T 
My hands are ice XD
2744 2018-10-17 19:38:49 It will debride the wound. Then to grow new, healthy skin, use pure vitamin E oil daily.
2745 2018-10-17 19:38:48 The reality is that the US will wait maybe 6 months for Brexit to soften us up then cruise in and save our oil. We'll be like Libya with fewer weapons. Once we're out of the EU, we'll be the lame wildebeest at the back of the herd.
2746 2018-10-17 19:38:46 How to pay for Space Force: kill the poor and sell them for meat. Drill for oil in Yosemite. Raid Fort Knox, keep the gold, and raise taxes on single mothers and people of color. Or you can vote in November. #VoteThemAllOut
2747 2018-10-17 19:38:46 What a surprise. 
I wonder what further concessions she can sign us up to. May and Oil rag Robbins should be sacked.
2748 2018-10-17 19:38:44 Unless the U.S. military physically seizes Saudis oil fields, and replaced the current Saudis regime, not supporting them ensures immediate destruction of the petrodollar. A gold standard destroys the petrodollar. Pain either way. Is this just targeting MbR or is this bigger?
2749 2018-10-17 19:38:32 If we continue to pump money into the Kingdom, we’re just delaying the inevitable day that we say to them, we don’t need your oil, we’re good.
2750 2018-10-17 19:38:29 oils are good for oily skin i use rosehip and almond oil and neutrogena hydroboost face cream

2753 2018-10-17 19:38:23 @SenSanders Your economical agenda for America are good but, for absolute succes I prefer to increase incomes than to cut spending. To increase incomes through retake of oil market monopoly by U.S., so on 2050 U.S. will be near to 0% budget deficit.
2754 2018-10-17 19:38:18 Where oh where can I find thc oil in bulk?
2755 2018-10-17 19:38:05 Just in case anyone was wondering, I'm a card carrying hippie now. I wrap crystals, make essential oil blends, practice energy healing, and read tarot cards and I'M READY TO COME OUT OF THE HIPPIE CLOSET. #fightme #idoitforthegoodvibes #imthiscoolinreallife
2756 2018-10-17 19:38:04 Electric/biofuels.

Oil companies are feeding you “medicine” that is making you sick. Stop taking it.

Read for yourself. Renewable energy isn’t expensive. Oil companies get BILLIONS of dollars in federal subsidies to lower their costs.
2757 2018-10-17 19:37:56 Spain and Italy have a lot of olive oil and they're not here #checkmateatheists
2758 2018-10-17 19:37:54 it's honestly the best. Beats tylenol and Advil. If you don't want any other effects, try the CBD oil capsules. You really won't feel high at all, just relaxed and experience some pain relief.
2759 2018-10-17 19:37:52 You saw them right? Soft as hell.. soaked in oil
2760 2018-10-17 19:37:44 That's right! Do not buy palm oil, açaí, guaraná, coffee, timber, aluminum, etc from Brazil
2761 2018-10-17 19:37:43 In the #TexasDebate @tedcruz said he would publish "facts" that show @BetoORourke voted for increase taxation on oil barrels. I just checked the site (wiping the slime off now) and see no such thing. LyinTed?
2762 2018-10-17 19:37:34 The Khasoggi story is truly horrifying and the attitude of those involved implies there have been many, many more we'll never know about. It is so f*cked up how the world won't stand up to Saudi. Money and oil over morality every time.
2763 2018-10-17 19:37:33 That's just lobbying - doesn't include things like "investments" or "loans" with Trump or Kushner businesses, or with the US oil companies that were the Saudis' traditional connections.
2764 2018-10-17 19:37:22 coconut oil. that’s it. that’s the tweet.
2765 2018-10-17 19:37:17 Follow the bread crumbs. What happened to that albatross around Jared's neck, 666 Fifth Ave? How much $$ has been funneled into Donnie's accts? He owes the oligarchs 4 bad investments and MBS has more oil money. Trump wants 2b a billionaire. He doesn't care who has the whack.
2766 2018-10-17 19:37:17 You don’t know what you’re not forgetting. But I can tell what you’re not remembering. The 22 pages of redacts in the 9/11 commission report by the Deep State. The Saudi connection and the fact we used it to kill millions of Iraqis all for Shell oil.
2767 2018-10-17 19:37:17 The oil is amaze balls
2768 2018-10-17 19:36:59 You've intruded her personal space, I mean her privacy, how dare you DM her, amma kemafa jarumache zaki iya chizon gawa
2769 2018-10-17 19:36:46 I miss seeing this work from you. But I totally get it. The furry community won’t pay the industry standard. I know so many artists in that situation. 

I do hope one day to see another oil painting from you tho 
2770 2018-10-17 19:36:24 Kwang Loon oil
2771 2018-10-17 19:36:23 Nah. CBD does nothing. It’s a holistic snake oil branding strategy to offer a useless alternative to THC. Get the real stuff.
2772 2018-10-17 19:36:02 Well the fancy 'i want pseudo non stick' answer is more like:
-heat bare pan
-add oil to barely coat
-cut heat once oil shimmers but before it smokes
-wipe excess oil but not too soon
-pan ready to use (with butter or oil)
2773 2018-10-17 19:35:59 Sounds like oil shortages until we found out that earth is constantly making oil.
2774 2018-10-17 19:35:57 jamaican platter so mf oil rn .
2775 2018-10-17 19:35:50 Russia has helped maintain the regime of Syria as an ally.  What we hear about Assad is absolute BS and propaganda.  It is the west and its allies that want a gas pipe through Syria (look up Genie Oil) and for this 100s of 1000s have been killed and millions displaced.
2776 2018-10-17 19:35:45 許すマジｗ
2777 2018-10-17 19:35:43 Trump shld blockaid Sadis oil ports, dont let any ship in or out.for a month, because they killed that reporter, by terrible tourchering him, cutting him up piece by piece while still alive.
Yikes!!
2778 2018-10-17 19:35:40 I just need someone to oil my scalp 
2779 2018-10-17 19:35:35 This is truly frightening for those of us who place so much value on and take great pride in the provenance and standards of what we produce...and what we consume .... so very worrying! 
2780 2018-10-17 19:35:25 I looooove olive oil
2781 2018-10-17 19:35:23 Nigga said DISA is the NCAA of the oil industry 
2782 2018-10-17 19:35:21 Some random country: we have oil.

USA: i am coming to provide peace and harmony with my force.
2783 2018-10-17 19:35:16 Not the first time though.. they were given cooking oil a few years ago after a tournament in South Africa
2784 2018-10-17 19:35:05 Just do a google search of videos of dug out chickens. You will see the years they occured and in which state(s) of the federation.
This particular video happened in Rivers State, the supposed rich oil state where the #wickedelites have pauperised the poor in their midst.
2785 2018-10-17 19:34:51 I'm not trying to insult you, just pointing out your bias. I think it will all work out for Saudi Arabia though, after-all, Donald Trump considers you an ally. Stop threatening higher oil prices though, bad strategy!
2786 2018-10-17 19:34:50 Oil.
2787 2018-10-17 19:34:42 Thanks. This isn't about smoke, it's about CO2 emissions, which are causing the climate breakdown - currently contributing to floods, fires and hurricanes. Coal is far worse than gas or oil, people should stop using it. If Jempsons stopped selling, that would help this happen.
2788 2018-10-17 19:34:38 don't hold your breath, #SenKennedy. @realDonaldTrump cares to much about #Saudi money and oil. he will never stand up to them. currently he is actively helping them cover up the #khashoggimurder
2789 2018-10-17 19:34:38 Bill, that's horseshit. Grant money is peanuts compared to oil money, banking, drugs, hedge funds, child trafficking, money laundering, & the rest of the shite the denier kleptocracy gets into. Sit down.
2790 2018-10-17 19:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see
2791 2018-10-17 19:34:19 THERE IS ZERO OIL IN THIS COMING AFTER ME ITS LIKE TRYING TO KILL A DOLPHIN TO TRY TO GET OIL OUT IN THE OCEAN THEN SET UP A SAVE A DOLPHIN ORGANIZATION TO COVER IT UP NOTHING MAKES SENSE, BUT THATS REALLY WHATS GOING ON FOR REAL FOR REAL REAL TALK THATS HAPPENING LMAO.
2792 2018-10-17 19:34:14 Stunning!
2793 2018-10-17 19:34:11 I'm in Florida and need cannabis oil desperately.
2794 2018-10-17 19:34:07 Every article about oil prices:
-if prices go up, it's bad
-if prices go down, it's bad
2795 2018-10-17 19:33:59 if you’re not about to pass out from the fumes are you really oil painting bruh?????????
2796 2018-10-17 19:33:58 I’m over oil as the great hope for the future. We need to get serious about solar and renewables. Imagine if we harness some of the 310+ days of sunshine per year in Alberta. #Alberta would be a real powerhouse province eh @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau ?
2797 2018-10-17 19:33:57 I agree full on fake kid. Her only aim in life to show Rk her bf and that she can oil hwood producers with pc help. Shame on her.
2798 2018-10-17 19:33:51 yeah, my brother and I use CPD oil, (myself for migraines, him for back/hip issues). These strains aren't quite the same, but it's the closest you can get from the OCS right now
2799 2018-10-17 19:33:50 The best way to handle dat..is to deliver at night..then makesure that with the help of the security your merchandisers pack the boxes of cooking oil just below the till operators place.if some1 wants the cooking oil.the till operator wil save them.1 per customer.we wont go wrong
2800 2018-10-17 19:33:30 A Texan... voting to tax oil... lol
2801 2018-10-17 19:33:29 And we don’t need to be sending our troops into harms way to defend their oil. Them can defend themselves. I have no problem with this military order. Fossil fuel has caused too many American deaths as it is. Would be a blessing if we just let the Middle East destroy themselves!
2802 2018-10-17 19:33:26 another  reason  Saudis  backed  Trumpo..  THEY  HATED  OBAMA  FOR  IRAN DEAL..as it  brought  down their  oil to  1970's prices..  they  were  bleeting  they were losing  revenue  &  will go  broke  etc. 
this  is  the main reason  Trumpo  reneged on  Iran  deal. again.. how
2803 2018-10-17 19:33:21 1973: OPEC oil embargo
Arab oil-producing nations announce cutting back oil exports to Western nations and Japan, the result was a total embargo until March 1974.  PS  "Somehow"...the world survived.  PPS.  Hence the battle-cry: "Down with the OPECERS"   ;)
2804 2018-10-17 19:33:10 no we are not sick there is shortage of cooking oil. remember.
2805 2018-10-17 19:32:49 i mean it’d be a bit hypocritical of us for saying to city that oil money saved them

2808 2018-10-17 19:32:30 Does anyone use Rosehip oil on their face? Do you like it? I have oily skin btw
2809 2018-10-17 19:32:27 Oh no I hate meat. Like grass no I love salad, different leaves taste different like some are nice warmed through with olive oil
2810 2018-10-17 19:32:25 My dad uses CBD oil because of arthritis in his back. It helps him get through the day with less pain and helps him sleep better.
2811 2018-10-17 19:32:23 You can't replace time with pressure since both are required, especially to create things like crude oil and coal over the course of millions of years. 

Your case would be slightly stronger if you claimed the flood lasted for millions of years in order to create fossil fuels.
2812 2018-10-17 19:32:18 Could you drop your oil prices please.
2813 2018-10-17 19:32:10 Yes, I have only been here for 4 years though and I only started to try to learn Italian like a year ago.
2814 2018-10-17 19:32:06 People seem to think that the events of reality (Hall winning Hart with 93 pts) would translate to this alternate reality they created where Hall stayed. That's not how that works. If you go back in time and change anything, you change the future. Haven't you watched TV? Lol
2815 2018-10-17 19:32:05 There are different ways to consume/use it  Paul. Depending on what issues you are using it for-cannabis oil is ingested and great for pain relief, anxiety etc
2816 2018-10-17 19:31:55 Raise your hand if you know where America buys it's oil from.
2817 2018-10-17 19:31:55 Or you are bought off by oil companies and Coal companies. .. just saying. Why spend money on things when we can get it for free from the sun?? I thought you were suppose to be a smart businessmen?
2818 2018-10-17 19:31:49 My car currently has low tire pressure, low oil & low fuel...wish I knew a mechanic

2822 2018-10-17 19:31:32 Is he profiting from oil , coal or both?
2823 2018-10-17 19:31:17 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
2824 2018-10-17 19:31:13 teachers made a tree oil is? It would take away with the real [current gen] console? Yes. Your Internet score is getting back at 11:30PM
2825 2018-10-17 19:31:09 Once again, 12-17-3 with MCDAVID, Hall, Draisaitl, and Eberle. "McDavid factor" is null and void when you look at that record.

2830 2018-10-17 19:30:36 I just wanna know what oil that is, that got her titts looking so glamorous 
2831 2018-10-17 19:30:33 I actually make an oil “mix” for my scalp with monoi, evoo, almond,  castor oil and moringa infused with ayurvedic powders and henna that I adapted from YouTuber CurlyProverbz.
2832 2018-10-17 19:30:32 We need to sell all the oil we can until technology find something that will work better and cheaper.
2833 2018-10-17 19:30:30 U.S. companies dominate the country's oil business, and most of Equatorial Guinea's exports end up in the United States. Equatorial Guinea is a textbook case of the resource curse: The country's leaders have squandered its oil wealth while its people have languished.
2834 2018-10-17 19:30:30 For how many years/decades have #health caring people like myself been trying to educate folks TO QUIT #SMOKING 

Today all that effort went up in #smoke due to a corrupt delusional crazy #government #OhCanada eh? 
I use #medical #canaboid oil #CBD #bcpoli #cdnpoli #Smokealert
2835 2018-10-17 19:30:29 If CBD oil threatens Big Pharma, that's all the reason I'd need to see CBD oil products legalized. Let the free market decide Big Pharma's fate, rather than allow them the peace of being able to monopolize the medical industry.
2836 2018-10-17 19:30:27 Mine just used a pan with oil in it.. And poured butter and salt on after.. It was awesome too.

2840 2018-10-17 19:30:18 I will keep shorting crude oil, $SCO $DWT  , vs $UCO $UWT
2841 2018-10-17 19:30:18 In my analysis, gold & USD are priced in oil, or to be more accurate (since oil is rarely of ever used by people) in the energy content of oil products.
2842 2018-10-17 19:30:10 Agree. That’s why I disagree with Amash on the merits on all those issues, and plenty more.

But he’s not a charlatan peddling snake oil in order to set up his next Fox News hit. He’s passionate about solving problems via government, even if we disagree on how and which problems.

2844 2018-10-17 19:29:57 HOW TO DETERMINE THE OIL CAPACITY OF AN ENGINE:
1. owner's manual, where it is usually listed under the lubrication system in the vehicle specifications section. 
2.  Another area to check includes the manufacturer's website.
Hope this helps!
2845 2018-10-17 19:29:53 joke especially the Coke dust.  It's just like coal dust only it's a by product of oil refineries. Any LNG terminal are high security targets and we've already had an oil tanker that exploded in the harbor back in the 70s that was strong enough to blow out windows on houses miles
2846 2018-10-17 19:29:53 When you're with your client getting an oil change and you run into one of ya niggas and you have to pretend to not be gang  #mylifeinanutshell #alwaysganggang

2851 2018-10-17 19:29:18 Will this report be released before of after the announcement of a massive upsurge in them buying stuff from the USA/Slashing Oil Prices? Asking for the cynics..
2852 2018-10-17 19:29:15 The LCSD Monthly Board Meeting is now in progress.

2863 2018-10-17 19:27:46 Don't forget the Saudi's. They say if anyone says anything bad about the Saudi dictatorship over the State sanctioned assasination of a U.S. journalist, the oil will go to 200-300/barrel. U.S. are stuck over the proverbial barrel-so-to-speak.

2865 2018-10-17 19:27:32 1. we do get revenues from oil.

2. not every oil producing country gets revenues from oil every year

please stop telling lies OR just think things through a bit more if you are genuinely thinking you are correct
2866 2018-10-17 19:27:21 Equatorial Guinea is perhaps the world's most striking example of why oil hurts, rather than helps, many of the countries that have it. ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil, Hess Corporation, and Noble Energy -- know all about it, though.
2867 2018-10-17 19:27:16 Gloves stop the transfer of sweat and oil from the skin to fragile pages, helping to prevent any further deterioration.
2868 2018-10-17 19:27:13 This Tweet is rediculous. Oil is a commodity, the price of which is determined by supply and demand to determine pricing.
2869 2018-10-17 19:27:01 Why is this video filmed so seductively. Like it's just coconut oil guys, chill.
2870 2018-10-17 19:27:00 Big Oil and Gas are spending millions to oppose this initiative. We need more help!

2872 2018-10-17 19:26:47 Big news is that China slowing is not (yet) giving developed markets inflationary relief (oil, iron ore, steel, etc stubborn to fall).
2873 2018-10-17 19:26:45 - rates definitely going up.
- trade wars still going on
- dollar going up
- oil going down
- bonds going down
- EM, especially China, still in trouble
- US stocks going up because TA says we go to 2840

I love the financial markets.
2874 2018-10-17 19:26:39 Won't touch oil zinsser again, I do prefer to use water based I think the right ones will out perform oil, look at parts of the eu and the USA only use water based at the paints have to deal will - 40° and 40°. Yes the sheen on w/b gloss isn't as good as oil gloss.
2875 2018-10-17 19:26:39 I think we have a communication issue. I'm not suggesting taking your oil.  I'm simply saying blackmailing the world with higher oil prices isn't a wise strategy. I have no agenda really. I recognize the complexity of it all but your government needs to accept accountability.

2879 2018-10-17 19:26:00 Trump knows this was a high level order, but he doesn't want to (1) blow up his arms sales and (2) run the risk of oil spiking over $100 before the mid-terms. Something is weird though that the neocons and MSM are pissed at Saudis over a journalist but not Yemen.

2902 2018-10-17 19:24:28 ~15 yrs. ago I saw a lecture on C-Span by American Petroleum Institute. Saudi Arabia is running out of oil. Their chief wells produce mostly water. (Water is poured down, crude floats and is pumped out). Water means the oil is running out. 
Prediction is the Royal Family is out.
2903 2018-10-17 19:24:19 You pretend the country that respect human rights deom this gate you judge other countries for non humat right purposes(e.g. economic, oil) . If US focus on its own affairs and let other countries manage their internal and external affairs, the world would be safe

2905 2018-10-17 19:24:15 I see dwindling U.S. interests there as we move away from oil dependence. More [bitter] enemies to be made than $. Of course, our countries are stuck in Afghanistan for a decade or three.

2922 2018-10-17 19:23:21 I bought a $20 battery and just buy the oil cartridges. Works perfect.
2923 2018-10-17 19:23:13 CBD oil! It has worked so well for KC.
2924 2018-10-17 19:23:01 It's just ironic mate Utd fans have been slagging us off for the dirty oil money for 10 years !
2925 2018-10-17 19:22:55 I live in BC where this technology was invented and iv been screamin from the rooftops about it for almost 2 years. Its amazing with tons of implications, internation energy independence, no more oil based wars on the middle east, this is huge
2926 2018-10-17 19:22:50 Oil and banks.
2927 2018-10-17 19:22:46 I smell like a walking pack of gum since I put peppermint oil on for my headache
2928 2018-10-17 19:22:42 Concourt part2 minus the Latin . Not raising any hopes, busy looking for cooking oil hangu.
2929 2018-10-17 19:22:42 Everyone is tip toeing around the Saudis because they can turn the oil off at any time if they don't get the backing they feel they deserve
2930 2018-10-17 19:22:41 That’s sad. Lmao I change my own even change my oil... and I’m a girl 
2931 2018-10-17 19:22:36 Wait until the Saudi "interogation" in their consulate hits the fan.  Oil prices will go through the roof.
2932 2018-10-17 19:22:36 Went in for an oil change, left with $300 of work on my car. 
2933 2018-10-17 19:22:35 I bought  $10 worth of stuff I didn't want so that Pick and Pay could "sell"  2 litre cooking oil to me, I really need a hug 
2934 2018-10-17 19:22:26 I’m learning about palm oil as I’m new to this. But I want to share awareness through our clothing and help towards protecting orangutans, other wildlife and forests. I think humans forget that we need nature and it’s the most important thing on earth. 
2935 2018-10-17 19:22:04 American gov. Is for sale 2 domestic & foreign oligarchs like Saudi Arabia, created by UK & USA in 1930’s to control oil. 100million$ is pocket change in relation to the multi billion$ destruction, casualties & refugees created in Syria by Saudis with weapons purchased from USA
2936 2018-10-17 19:21:59 Piece of shit at the oil change has a maga sign on his CAR window AND is wearing a maga hat. I want to throw a rock at him
2937 2018-10-17 19:21:58 We have the Pax vaporizer and it works really well with either oil or flowers. But they're very pricey.
2938 2018-10-17 19:21:57 Qatar has 5 yrs of oil and is burning through its reserves fast.
KSA has 20 yrs at current production lvls short of new fields. At the most. KSA has added 40% GDP worth of debt since 2014. They are poor nations. Its a house built on sand.
2939 2018-10-17 19:21:45 I gotta get an oil change today.
2940 2018-10-17 19:21:27 ECAD, Inc -  Our team is in barn G, spot 74. We've been a proud exhibitor of the Oil Show since the 90's! Y'all stay dry!
2941 2018-10-17 19:21:25 Oil slipping below $70 and the overbought Energy Sector XLE is testing recent support. Still an 'under-weight' in our rankings.
2942 2018-10-17 19:21:10 doesn't matter. We still import bt 10-20% from them at any given time and we pay the global price despite being the #1 oil producer in the world (aug 2018).  The US can be energy independent and end the monopoly of oil.
2943 2018-10-17 19:21:07 clinique mild cleanser, some kind of organic natural exfoilator, pure rose hip oil for moisturising and tea tree oil for pimples.
2944 2018-10-17 19:20:54 Damn, baby. Nobody puts Republican fossils in a corner. ;) lol.

They just carbon away, year after year, until they turn into oil 1000 years from now and still keeps giving to their oil industry donors.
2945 2018-10-17 19:20:46 Oil v water the struggle Israel

2947 2018-10-17 19:20:36 “what’s CBD oil... and is that what’s in the juul???” 

why is this the question I just got asked
2948 2018-10-17 19:20:34 Got an oil change now all my baby need is a wash.
2949 2018-10-17 19:20:23 RALPH , he is he reason we are in our current mess of a finacial situation. He doubled hospital wait times, let our schools and roads crumble. Too “eliminate” our debt, but news flash he didn’t, he just created an infrastructure debt meanwhile making us dependent on oil rev
2950 2018-10-17 19:20:23 The itching is normal for the 1st few weeks. Once you're past it. It's all good. Also using beard oil helps.
2951 2018-10-17 19:20:23 Really, promises to make rich richer . Get back to Oil & Coal Energy ... Just because he promised something, it doesn’t mean it is good
2952 2018-10-17 19:20:22 Apparently it takes 45 fucking minutes to get your oil changed
2953 2018-10-17 19:20:21 You can’t have revenues without that oil. Point is every oil producing country in the world can get revenues from oil . But for some reason the United Kingdom either can’t , or its lying. You decide.
2954 2018-10-17 19:20:11 #DeepState putting pressure on #Turkey to release "evidence" of #SaudiArabia killing of #journalist.

Why? 

Trouble between #Trump admin and #SaudiArabia means higher oil prices and bad press before #November elections! 

Just sayin.
2955 2018-10-17 19:20:07 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
2956 2018-10-17 19:19:53 This guy never takes a picture without his car. He is either inside it, on top of it or beside it. If he wants to change the oil, he will tell u then send u the car's picture. If he says 50 words 35 is "my car".  
2957 2018-10-17 19:19:40 Maybe only Nee’oil, when he fancied ‘an impromptu chilli  night?’  #thearchers
2958 2018-10-17 19:19:39 Nymex Settles 10/17/18 - CL Nov18: 69.75 (-2.17) (-4.7% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2959 2018-10-17 19:19:33 Definitely a pot, bit of oil and kernels. So much better (and better for you). My dog won’t touch microwave popcorn, but she’ll eat real popcorn. That says everything to me!
2960 2018-10-17 19:19:29 Obesity will be the a bigger killer as long as the government subsidizes soy farmers and allows the crap that kills you to be put in foods. The corn oil and things used are suicide, I turned my life around dropped 70+ lbs in 6 months because I wanted to outlive my dad.
2961 2018-10-17 19:19:23 Park your car up then and cycle in the empty bus lanes if you wish . . . . Oil does help!
2962 2018-10-17 19:19:22 Snake oil. It is funemployed except you are selling a product.
2963 2018-10-17 19:19:22 Then Hayden brought me into Max's room. Gotta say, that's the quickest I've gone from burning the midnight oil to savoring your bad novel in peace.
2964 2018-10-17 19:19:11 @ShepNewsTeam seriously?? The un wants special investigation of Saudi journalist possibly killed in embassy...the same un behind oil for food...and raping girls in Africa....yeah...that seems smart
2965 2018-10-17 19:19:08 The finances do need sorting out. It's a pity as reducing reliance on gas and oil would help in a number of ways.
2966 2018-10-17 19:19:04 you should try weeds that’s high in CBD or CBD oil for anxiety tho
2967 2018-10-17 19:18:59 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
2968 2018-10-17 19:18:49 I take oregano oil as it will kill almost anything that makes you sick.
2969 2018-10-17 19:18:45 Am I the only one who looks forward to the day the oil runs out?
2970 2018-10-17 19:18:41 I peeled the skin off my lips yesterday because they were super dry and it ripped all the way into my mouth and cause it to swell bleed and hurt all day yesterday and in the past 2 hours its turned into a cold sore  I HATE having sensitive lips, Walmart is out of teatree oil to
2971 2018-10-17 19:18:40 When the price of meat does up so does oil and grain
2972 2018-10-17 19:18:34 3:18PM 17 OCT currently *NO WAIT* For State Inspections, oil change, alignment, diagnostic, why wait when there is a Carmasters Vehicle Available at Carmasters Automotive LLC for you to drive while yours is getting repaired (please reserve)
2973 2018-10-17 19:18:25 One must understand that not EVERY regulation is a bad thing. 
They keep people from eating salmonella, or swimming in oil rivers, or keeping Bald Eagles from  extinction. 
@realDonaldTrump only care about #regulations that impede his ability to make money! #EffEverythingElse
2974 2018-10-17 19:18:14 I’ve been putting off changing my oil today but I need to get it down before the Brewers/Dodgers game.
2975 2018-10-17 19:18:13 Sitting at Walmart waiting for my oil to get changed and the lady next to me answered her phone when it was over she looked at me and said “fucking people messing up my lil Wayne” 
2976 2018-10-17 19:18:02 FANTASTIC, Mr President !AMERICA UNDER UR VERY CAPABLE WATCH'S  TRULY WAXING BETTER,GREATER AND SUPERIOR.THANKS FOR RECORD LOW JOBLESS CLAIMS IN 50 YRS.AMERICAS ECONOMY NOW # 1.AMERICA'S NOW LARGEST PRODUCER OF OIL/ GAS.GOD BLESS OUR EXCELLENT President Trump
2977 2018-10-17 19:17:56 Wrong!
1. Vendors needed another opportunity
2. Arbitrageurs have deeper pockets than the $0.5bn oil industry in Zim.
3. Cooking oil is now a store of value
2978 2018-10-17 19:17:37 When he wasn’t busy building his youth foundation, John Wayne Gacy dabbled in oil painting.
2979 2018-10-17 19:17:22 Wait! So with all the billions phone companies are making in Nigeria there’s not one phone factory in the country. 

- 62 years after oil was discovered we still can't survive without importing petrol. 

- In 2018, bore-hole & roads are still campaign promises.

WE NORMAL SO?
2980 2018-10-17 19:17:12 Technically, oil is covered in desert.
2981 2018-10-17 19:17:07 Amina Zakari's emplantment as INEC Boss isn't a plot of good faith by Buhari but a continued slogan of corrupt manipulation of the masses in favour to British gain of Biafran resources  (oil & gas) thereby giving Sokoto Caliphate latitude to Islamize Biafra land. Why Britain?
2982 2018-10-17 19:17:03 They’re building these in Houston, too. Faux stucco, 3 story, dog jails. 

Yeesh!
2983 2018-10-17 19:16:55 USA said Saddam has WMD and Iraq invaded but world saw nothing found and  country destroyed just for the sake of oil. What press was doing at that time? Did someone cared ?
2984 2018-10-17 19:16:47 yea innocent Saudi Arabia it's not like they're committing mass genocide in Yemen or anything.....it's not like they are the main funders of international Wahhabist terrorist like Isis.....everyone just wants to take their water (oil)
2985 2018-10-17 19:16:44 Boy wey sabi. Your head get oil
2986 2018-10-17 19:16:43 Life is pouring olive oil on your hands after you wash them so you can roll a damn cigarette
2987 2018-10-17 19:16:40 Smoother than an oil spill and sharper  than a razor..
2988 2018-10-17 19:16:40 Add eucalyptus oil, got it
2989 2018-10-17 19:16:36 With one of our featured games of the week, the Buffalo Bills are visiting the Indianapolis Colts @ Lucas Oil Stadium.  

Can the @buffalobills pull out a win with @JoshAllenQB injured & the recently signed FA @DAnderson314 starting at QB?
2990 2018-10-17 19:16:35 It's actually not that unhealthy as long as you vape/use oil & not smoke. Also many people use it as medicine and it seems to make them healthy not unhealthy.
2991 2018-10-17 19:16:31 Try using an oil when taking it off! Baby oil, coconut oil, olive oil, etc. It will help tremendously!
2992 2018-10-17 19:16:26 Yes- this is the #oil lobby fighting back despite the fact we have 10 years to halve the Worlds #emissions if we want to save millions of #lives & don’t want #catastrophic #climatechange #OMV are one of the 100 companies causing it! #fossilfuels
2993 2018-10-17 19:16:26 I guess there is a stigma to the people who may be using it, aka "blunt", whereas there are some folks out there using it strictly for pain management.  #WeedWednesday #weedthenorth #weed #CBD #Oil
2994 2018-10-17 19:16:22 There’s government and settler land theft stories all over this country! My family has ours in Texas, we fought and lost land with a grant amount of oil in it, and despite the length of time we invested fighting the TX Supreme Court overturned the monetary award we got.
2995 2018-10-17 19:16:15 Short .89 $cl_f #oott #oil will update in real time to stop or profit move
2996 2018-10-17 19:16:13 That the especial illusionistic nature of depiction oil painting allowed, its ability to capture textures and 1-to-1 naturalism was significantly different than seeing a marble sculpture say.
2997 2018-10-17 19:16:13 Dump Saudi as an ally now! We don't need the oil and let Europe fend for themselves! They've killed 3000 New Yorkers and that's all we need! The only ally we need in the region is Israel! The koran justifies lying to protect Islam. Sever all defence and civilian contracts!
2998 2018-10-17 19:16:11 U.S. oil ends below $70 a barrel as inventories continue to rise EIA reports 6.5 million-barrel weekly rise in U.S. crude stockpileshttps://on.mktw.net/2CpggWm
2999 2018-10-17 19:16:07 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
3000 2018-10-17 19:15:55 I love Oklahoma too. Just like anywhere else there’s room for improvement. We just had another rural hospital close. We should be a leader in wind and solar but we are way behind. The two things we have more than gas and oil is wind and sun, which will never run out.
3001 2018-10-17 19:15:54 Now that we will be oil exporting country in some years to come why the Govt put the prices of fuel up?
3002 2018-10-17 19:15:52 Turkey has not yet confirmed the evidence, forget abt US interrogating the case! 
So long as there is dependency on the oil rich Saud, there is no way that other countries will part their ways from them even if it means for them to compromise on their values.
3003 2018-10-17 19:15:41 Less water = desert = oil = smog = more desert = more oil! That is the natural order of the universe!
3004 2018-10-17 19:15:37 thank God for THC oil  but I need some tree
3005 2018-10-17 19:15:33 Some oil got on my finger while trying to cook and now it hurts

3007 2018-10-17 19:15:27 I see anyone’s reservation as a rotary engine owner “has to add a quart of oil about every 3 tanks of gas.” And try as they may, Car Sales people can only disclose this fact during the sale. (Customers seem to develop amnesia after the new wears off) Still, I want another one.
3008 2018-10-17 19:15:27 I wish the Nigerian Government can copy what Saudi Arabia is doing. Same oil money, harder climate condition but massive projects. Fast becoming a better version of Dubai.
3009 2018-10-17 19:15:18 While working a summer job in an oil refinery in Iran that my Dad got me, a friend of his that worked in SA in the 60s and early 70s showed me pictures of public punishments including floggings, beheadings, and dismemberments of Men and Women. Knowing him, I asked why? He said...
3010 2018-10-17 19:15:18 China’s economy is not doing very well and the US is now the leading producer of oil . Maybe we shouldn’t sell our oil on the open market and just use it here in ten US . Let Saudi and China eat sand .
3011 2018-10-17 19:15:12 They are still Bedouins under their robes. Without oil they would still be living in tents and riding camels.

3013 2018-10-17 19:15:05 Turkey supported ISIS until Russia started bombing the shit out of them. Serena Shim lost her life in a “car accident,” while investigating arms flowing out of Turkey across the border and into Syria in exchange for stolen Syrian oil.

3015 2018-10-17 19:14:56 Pompeo and Trump are ready to back up an investigation by an accused murderer of himself. They will find Prince bin Salam innocent- like Putin. America can survive without the Saudi oil, but Trump’s evil financial empire can’t survive without Saudi money.
3016 2018-10-17 19:14:48 I went out with a girl last night who was so black, when she got out of my car, the oil light came on.
3017 2018-10-17 19:14:48 If you cook them whole in the oven with salt and oil rubbed into the skin then they're alright...but then that's true for pretty much every edible substance
3018 2018-10-17 19:14:45 Do not solve the problems of the farmers, instead of eradicating this problem, the oil farmers will solve
3019 2018-10-17 19:14:44 sesame oil just changed my life wow
3020 2018-10-17 19:14:31 Berger is specifically arguing that the rise of oil painting as the dominant form of artistic production was concomitant with the rise of mercantilism and the ability of upper middle, non-aristocratic classes to own and the be seen as owning.

3025 2018-10-17 19:14:14 Iran will NOT be attacked
At least not without the destruction of Saudi oil infrastructure and both the manufacturing AND STORAGE facilities of Yidrael's nuclear weapons (along with every runway in Yidrael) turned to dust

3028 2018-10-17 19:14:07 True. Just paid nearly 1/3 rd more for 100 gal of fuel oil that I did 6 months ago. Live in NE with very snowy cold winters. Looks like I'm going to freeze this winter more & more.
3029 2018-10-17 19:13:57 My mom blesses every house we move into with holy oil lol
3030 2018-10-17 19:13:54 I always wondered why massage oil and candles were a duo thing too? Like how can being covered in oil next to open flames be relaxing in any way?
3031 2018-10-17 19:13:50 I wore my new expensive jacket to class and of course they were oil painting in this classroom I cannot put this jacket literally anywhere safe help

3034 2018-10-17 19:13:22 An oil leak can be really bad like if the engine has warped and it doesnt wut right or some dumbass didn't tighten down 1 bolt or even a head gasket which depending on the engine could be a big chore
3035 2018-10-17 19:13:22 We know that the representatives of Congress and the US House of Representatives are representatives of the arms, oil and pharmaceutical companies. They are tools in the hands of capitalism. You do not have real democracy. You adore the State of Israel even in your election.
3036 2018-10-17 19:13:21 We got a station in Tempe next to the Marketplace, one in Gilbert on Val Vista, another one in South Phoenix (this one is the worst, sometimes burns oil in addition to coal in the summer power strain) and one in Glendale.
3037 2018-10-17 19:13:09 No just fluff news to sale off cheap paper Oil on market for profit
3038 2018-10-17 19:13:08 There are many ways to deliver without risking being mobbed. Is it hard to deliver at night and people wake up to filled shelves koOK, choppies n all? It's not hard to get a solution to tht problem unless you say people are sleeping at shops waiting for delivery of cooking oil
3039 2018-10-17 19:12:58 Poor demand, the weaker pound and higher costs including the oil hike are blamed for Flybe’s expected full-year losses, triple what analysts expected. The low-cost airline plans to reduce capacity and focus on its most popular routes.
3040 2018-10-17 19:12:55 I made them in the oven. I added some turmeric, rosemary, salt, a dash of oil and 2 spoons of water. Covered it in an oven dish and made it in the oven for 40 minutes
3041 2018-10-17 19:12:52 Saudis will be sanctioned once facts prove they were involved. It's a dicey situation cuz America will come out the loser. Cancelling the Arms contract affects 500,000 workers. Saudis already said they will double price of oil if they are sanctioned. Magnitsky act is only option
3042 2018-10-17 19:12:46 Artichoke. The heart and the lower parts of the leaves are edible. One Italian peasant way of cooking would be, halve it marinate in olive oil, pepper, salt and lemon juice. Pre heat oven and grill to high, bake skin side up till it almost blakens, turn, leave a few min. Done.
3043 2018-10-17 19:12:38 @BrookeBCNN Dead Saudi journalist doesn’t matter. Oil does matter
3044 2018-10-17 19:12:35 The best soybeans are certified organic. GM soybeans are slow toxins.

Soybean oil is also a poor quality fat source (high n6 to n3 ratio). Brain is largely fat, so you really don't want to be soy-brained...
3045 2018-10-17 19:12:21 I can’t wait to get home I’m doing a hot oil treatment and a facial mask.
3046 2018-10-17 19:12:19 So you will continue to use it? Or perhaps start using it? The question still applies to recreational cannabis in oil form if you don't already have a prescription for medical.

3048 2018-10-17 19:12:17 I don’t think it’s limited to the US. Or oil. Merkel is helping Putin out with Nordstream II and his government has also reportedly been unkind to dissident journalists.

3050 2018-10-17 19:12:08 Perhaps if the oil & gas industry had a little more social responsibility they could have been developing them for the last 40/50 years since it's been obvious that fossil fuels won't last forever! You know a little business diversity!
3051 2018-10-17 19:12:07 @HarvestSnaps I love harvest snaps! But I need to know if you are you using GMO peas? Also,could you use better oil than canola? Please? Thanks!
3052 2018-10-17 19:12:02 I survived a rather disappointing experience with some Pompeii brand olive oil.  Am I eligible for your charity?
3053 2018-10-17 19:12:00 Saudi Arabia coerced George W. into a War with Iraq after our own CIA 
created an enemy of Iran.  Then they robbed us all of Three (3) Trillion
Dollars worth of Iraqi oil.
The Saudis are our enemy !   Now MURDER !
If you can't see that you ARE stupid.
3054 2018-10-17 19:11:56 If Somali Republic remains #United as Nation-State in future it will be #economically  most powerfull State in the region thanks to #OIL & GAS deposits.Ethiopia uses the carrot that has big markets but they are scared to have a rich and democratic State in Somalia not under them

3058 2018-10-17 19:11:38 Ted Cruz has done nothing for average Texans. Only his big oil buddies. Just as YOU have done nothing for America except divide us.
3059 2018-10-17 19:11:32 @David_Gergen Dead journalist doesn’t matter out here. Oil does matter
3060 2018-10-17 19:11:30 Diesel, propane and furnace oil will continue to be available this weekend throughout construction. We have added staff to help our customer at the Self Service location - which will remain open 24/7.
3061 2018-10-17 19:11:17 40% of the oil comes from Canada, 9% from Saudi Arabia.
3062 2018-10-17 19:11:09 @ShepNewsTeam I disagree that the issue with the Saudis is our reliance on oil. It’s the barrier against Iran. Evil vs. more evil.
3063 2018-10-17 19:11:07 No I’m not suggesting you have said that. But certain other areas have because they know people would be waiting a long time & that gives them a much longer interval to realise maximum benefit from their current significant sunk-capital investment in oil & auto-manufacturing.
3064 2018-10-17 19:10:58 Ironically, after Elijah filled up the vessels, the widow was still clueless about what to do with your oil (2 Kings 4:7)

Some of us have "vessels" God has shown us, but we still feel disadvantaged. #LazyNigerianYou
3065 2018-10-17 19:10:56 @RanaForoohar Saudi story doesn’t matter out here. Not a top 1000 issue. Oil matters
3066 2018-10-17 19:10:51 I once stood behind a woman who asked what kind of oil was used in making the fried rice. When told it was soybean oil, she asked what kind. When told what kind, she asked what brand. And so on. [I ordered the #3.]

3073 2018-10-17 19:10:16 Why can't you apply your theory of the "free market" to green energy. If big oil tech becomes extinct, won't green fuel tech replace it? Of course it will but that thinking isn't consistant with your narrative.

3083 2018-10-17 19:09:50 Remember how Bush II had all of Bin Laden's family flown out of the U.S., after 9/11, when U.S. air travel was restricted? I guess Shrub had oil interests in Saudi Arabia & Cheney had Halliburton. And Trump has hotels? I'm absolutely sick of psychopaths running our country!

3092 2018-10-17 19:09:17 Would you stop driving or using anything that uses oil?
3093 2018-10-17 19:09:16 It’s not as bad as truffle oil, which, imho, should be illegal.
3094 2018-10-17 19:08:55 There are scientists on both sides. You have some scientists who think the liar-in-chief is greedy and in the pocket of the oil companies, etc., and you have those who think he is just stupid. Two sides, plain and simple.

3099 2018-10-17 19:08:47 Fact is the KSA has crossed the Rubicon.
We now know for sure that they will use their oil supplies as an exonomic weapon when it suits them.
Therefor the markets need to build new capacity ASAP.
3100 2018-10-17 19:08:24 The murder/dismemberment of the journalist at the Saudi embassy in Turkey is going to be covered up. The US will do nothing about it. Why? Because there's a bigger fish in the water.  Oil being one of the biggest. US weapons sales being the second. @realDonaldTrump Sad to say...
3101 2018-10-17 19:08:18 Great recap' of the #JamalKhashoggi affair by @ShepNewsTeam right now with what we know from various sources as well as a very good question: Would all this be happening if the desert was not covering oil?
3102 2018-10-17 19:08:16 Haven't looked at CHK in a long time. Without Aubrey, it became boring. My fav. Aubrey was when they sold large crude oil call option strips and "converted" them to natural gas fixed price hedges (6:1). Amazing nobody went to jail for that.
3103 2018-10-17 19:08:13 No doubt.  The real bridge is spectacular and all but this is a serious reach.  Shoulda just stuck with the oil derrick.  It was the best prop in the league til they scuttled it.
3104 2018-10-17 19:08:06 Argon oil! Xxx
3105 2018-10-17 19:08:02 She’s in A3 too if that’ll save you some time and oil iirc
3106 2018-10-17 19:08:00 Bag of holding is too obvious: I call in my favors, buy a barrel of oil for now and a laxative for later, and we make our alcoholic hill giant friend be our cocaine-mule once we get to the royal docks. The cover story is he's just a migrant worker here to rebuild the cathedral.
3107 2018-10-17 19:07:56 It is not. Copper paint, nuln oil wash. NMM is morally wrong.
3108 2018-10-17 19:07:54 Every time I take my car in to get something simple like an oil change, new tires or wipers.. the workers always inform me of some bigger more expensive problem that I’m skeptical even exists
3109 2018-10-17 19:07:52 @narendramodi when the entire world is struggling on oil prices why not grant higher incentives to battery operated vehicles
3110 2018-10-17 19:07:42 The oil magnate "Broke" is boldly written on my Bio, I don't need to say more.
3111 2018-10-17 19:07:41 No no, I totally get it. It might be smart to prepare when you go to this one. Light some calming incense before you leave the house and perhaps make a satchel with lavender oil or the dried version, hematite to absorb the negative energy and a piece of clear quartz to enhance it
3112 2018-10-17 19:07:40 Have you tried CBD oil?
3113 2018-10-17 19:07:38 If only Turkey had a stockpile of oil...that seems to be the way to get the rich white men to pay attention
3114 2018-10-17 19:07:28 I buy CBD oil at my dispensary for pain. It’s not just “recreational”.
3115 2018-10-17 19:07:27 Anyone who claims that the oil and gas industry is dying because of regulations is either a liar or a fool. Fossil Fuels are horribly inefficient in comparison to renewables and are totally unsustainable. Anyone who understands economics can see the see the writing on the wall.
3116 2018-10-17 19:07:20 our dependence on foreign oil is at all time lows. I believe we can be oil dependent. I'm also sure the kingdom's "intelligence" is what lead us into Iraq. emboldening both saud and irani interests. we're just useful idiots in that region.
3117 2018-10-17 19:07:16 It’s ignorance personified, from the people who tried to sell us Wipe1 and Sturgeon’s #GrowthCommission Wipe2.

From the same snake oil salesmen and women who predicted oil revenues of between £6.7 - 7.9 BILLION for ‘independence’ day in 2016, which actually realised £100 MILLION

3128 2018-10-17 19:06:36 The amount of ignorance is disturbing. How can you lie this much to the Australian people. With the amount of space, wind and sun Australia has, solar and wind energy are super viable options. Incredible and clearly he is in the pockets of the oil industry

3131 2018-10-17 19:06:11 My husband's company literally cleans up oil spills for a living.

They kill nothing but riparian grasses and small trees.

The bad soil gets trucked away and  the area gets reclaimed.

1 year later, you wouldn't even know there was a spill there.

3136 2018-10-17 19:05:41 Rising oil prices will offset this for some. Higher interest rates are a risk, in particular, to Costa Rica, El Salvador and, increasingly, Nicaragua.

3139 2018-10-17 19:05:30 Sanctioning Saudi Arabia will force the price of oil through the roof...our economy is skating on thin ice...if oil skyrockets the futures market will go batty and the crush to the markets will be massive...exposing our economy to its weakness, ruining the Republicans.

Apart from cornering the world supply of houseflies, they actually are a minor world player, they extort Muslims for the privilege of visiting Mecca.

3157 2018-10-17 19:04:03 Is the answer because they’re massive oil producers?
3158 2018-10-17 19:03:57 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

Saudis need the PR to offset this damage. Lets allow them the space to do it. I think it’s a Win win if we sit
3161 2018-10-17 19:03:44 These people need an I international lesson on what's acceptable. Clearly, their 7th-century beliefs are and never were compatible with the western ideal. A line in the sand needs to be drawn no matter how much oil they have.

3165 2018-10-17 19:02:56 the ind preclusion is unconstitutional so technically a gras cbd oil is lawful and if that is not their opinion the real question is what a federal judge opinion would be.
3166 2018-10-17 19:02:41 Omg! The west is full of shit. Canada got cut off my Saudi for daring to ask about the wellbeing of activists.  As long as Saudi Arabia has oil and therefore money to buy arms the west, America in particular will turn a blind eye..  Hypocrisy

3179 2018-10-17 19:00:45 how i know summer is over: my coconut oil turns solid
3180 2018-10-17 19:00:39 Pot being legal is nothing but politics to keep our dollar at where it is. We are soon running out of oil an other resources.
3181 2018-10-17 19:00:37 @Solidnatz After I saw report our deficit is the highest it has ever been today I don’t think market can sustain, Mulling also oil stocks!

Criticize the individual moves if you want, but the whole body of work is better than what he started with
3184 2018-10-17 19:00:24 OIL BURNS THEN IS GONE FOREVER

OIL IS DIRTY AND POLLUTES EVERYTHING

IT TOUCHES BUT IT MAKES THE RICH RICH ONLY

WITH SOLAR POWER THERE IS NO WASTE

WITH SOLAR EVERYONE CAN GET RICH

WITH SOLAR WE CAN LIVE IN A CLEAN HEALTHY

AND SAFER WORLD

MAFIA POWER OF OUR WORLD WON'T ALLOW
3185 2018-10-17 19:00:22 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
3186 2018-10-17 19:00:21 I love that Saudi Arabia thinks they can blackmail the world with oil.  I don't think the US will punish your country beyond a slap on the wrists but I don't think blackmailing America with oil prices is the right strategy. Throw MBS under the bus for his mistake, issue resolved.
3187 2018-10-17 19:00:19 It’s not the worst porn clip title/caption, oil is nice but come on now if you gonna give pornhub a run for their money don’t be half ass with.
3188 2018-10-17 19:00:07 Ok I’m going to digress, before the cooking oil shortage why have I never heard of Roil, you might need to sit down with your marketing team because your oil is pretty good but had NEVER heard of it. I have another question but can only ask it direct, hope you respond.
3189 2018-10-17 19:00:04 Your shop looks great ! Just wondering will you pack & ship yourself ? When I worked for a gallery a while back they shipped an oil painting and did wrap part of a painting in bubble wrap and it made marks on the painting... probably due to the heat  just for your reference...

3191 2018-10-17 18:59:58 FFS. its not about oil. its about oil revenues that the govt gets. 

you know how that works right?

please tell me you are not 1 of the nats who thinks that the govt gets the price of a barrel for every barrel that is extracted?
3192 2018-10-17 18:59:50 Susah:( pake bio oil katanya bisa atau glyderm
3193 2018-10-17 18:59:50 Is that common in Texas? Is it in a flood plane?
3194 2018-10-17 18:59:47 We need to bring back war crimes tribunal. That’s the only way these wars for oil might stop.
3195 2018-10-17 18:59:46 Big Oil invests in these NO campaigns like Brer Rabbit sez “don’t throw me in the briar patch” - it is a campaign of public perception management. At the end of the day Big Oil WANTS carbon pricing - they feign opposition to weak carbon fee policy to constrict the policy debate.
3196 2018-10-17 18:59:45 Yup. Cut the taxes for the rich 20%.  And deregulate banks and oil.  2007 here we come.  Idiots
3197 2018-10-17 18:59:38 Except in the Oil and Gas industry.
3198 2018-10-17 18:59:34 So where can oil be headed to based on your charting?
3199 2018-10-17 18:59:30 some body take my car for an oil change pls and thanks
3200 2018-10-17 18:59:30 I like it because it's fine. My favorite is to saute cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts and garlic in olive oil. Add in a splash of white wine and toss it with angel hair.
3201 2018-10-17 18:59:23 Did anyone really think that the United States under Trump was going to sanction our major supplier of foreign Oil and the Bank roller of Trump Business ventures in Saudi Arabia? Please, we would be kidding ourselves!!! Reality is this is all going to be brushed under the Rug.
3202 2018-10-17 18:58:57 I entirely disagree with that statement. Oil went 12-17-3 in 32 games with McDavid, Hall, Draisaitl, and Eberle healthy in 2015-16. 69 point pace. Last year was rough, and Oil got 78 points. In no year with Hall did Oil ever finish with anything more than that.
3203 2018-10-17 18:58:44 Everybody talking about their gas burning faster and I’m here like but my mileage is the same or more right now...

 ‘Many of these ppl don’t even know how to check their coolant or oil or what is is. . but you telling me about the chemical composition of petrol

3205 2018-10-17 18:58:32 I tried the oil and it didn’t work but I use a scrub and it has it in there and it’s working lol  im also trying a Indian healing clay mask once a week
3206 2018-10-17 18:58:32 Got them olive oil backwood, Hit My Line!
3207 2018-10-17 18:58:31 According to Sowore, he specifically said Ekiti land is fertile for growing weed.

If the Niger Delta is known for crude oil, annexing the weed growing capacity of Ekiti, we can be a major exporter of weed aka Marijuana.
3208 2018-10-17 18:58:24 Like it or not the Saudis are a close ally. We do billions of dollars of trade with them. I guess you would rather see Russia & China takeover & have oil prices soar to $200 a barrel. We do need to look at all the facts before totally giving up this relationship
3209 2018-10-17 18:58:20 The weak pound again st the dollar doesn’t help. Last time when oil was at the current price in dollars the pound was $1.60 plus.
3210 2018-10-17 18:58:18 ∅This message can't be viewed because you don't have cooking oil
3211 2018-10-17 18:58:18 I was carrying my 750ml cooking oil and everyone kept asking me where I bought it and how much. '08 des ja vous.
3212 2018-10-17 18:58:17 Think oil and gas will be around some some time yet ! Solar definitely a sector with potential for graphene.
3213 2018-10-17 18:58:13 So true. We’ve looked the other way when it comes to Saudi misdeeds for decades. They starve Yemeni children and we say nothing. 
We kowtow to big oil interests when we could be the world leader in renewable energies. Shame on us.
3214 2018-10-17 18:58:06 The product is a big hit in the US with children with seizures because it’s illegal to give a narcotic to a child as well as in Canada so people are going to non-psychoactive  tinture And oil’s
3215 2018-10-17 18:58:04 Bratwurst with cream cheese and red onion, capers, and jalapeños, with mustard and oil and vinegar served open-face on potato bread.
3216 2018-10-17 18:58:03 How high will oil go? Iran is the biggest X factor. These sanctions should be taken out against Saudi a country which literally gets away with murder of innocent children or anyone who dares speak against them
3217 2018-10-17 18:57:59 @realDonaldTrump the Saudis are threatening $200/bbl oil. issue an executive order or via EPA to get rid of "boutique blends" for gasoline to COMPLETELY stabilize our fuel supply and then drill everywhere. we won't need to buy oil from anyone

3220 2018-10-17 18:57:44 Norway is not really outside the EU - they adhere to rules, they pay money, they have open boarders. Even their PM said she didn’t recommend the arrangement for the UK. It is just an EU membership lite that keeps the EU away from their oil revenues and currency.
3221 2018-10-17 18:57:41 Their current regulations will be  mostly existent from whatever country specific coal, gas and oil industry regulation it has developed prior to LNG development.
3222 2018-10-17 18:57:40 Gas buddy said gas prices coming down today don't see that still very much the same. Oil companies getting richer each day with no stop or push back from any government.
3223 2018-10-17 18:57:38 HIS: 1973– OPEC imposes an oil embargo against a number of Western countries, considered to have helped Israel in its war against Egypt and Syria. 17/10
3224 2018-10-17 18:57:37 Hahahaah. You keep pivoting. 

1st Argument: No evidence, fake news, lies, liberals, Turkey, Qatar
2nd Argument: America kills way more people, why you care about 1 guy.
3rd Argument: If you continue to criticize, oil price will increase.

It must be nice having all that oil. 
3225 2018-10-17 18:57:32 How much oil are they pumping now?  What happened to the international oil companies that were operating there?  Could this have anything to do with the crisis?
3226 2018-10-17 18:57:30 ใช่555
3227 2018-10-17 18:57:27 I have to pay $160 to get an oil change in the BMW, so it could be worse 
3228 2018-10-17 18:57:21 Getting an oil change today like a big girl 
3229 2018-10-17 18:57:10 I’m being serious when I say this. I went to Colorado, and bought me CBD oil for my migraines and anxiety. It is all good now, thanks to that oil. That oil is a lifesaver.
3230 2018-10-17 18:56:59 Maybe not built on oil but built with money all the same 
Andy Cole record British transfer fee 
Roy Keane record British transfer fee 
Dwight Yorke just under British Record transfer Fee 
Japp Stam most expensive defender ever
3231 2018-10-17 18:56:58 Ginger, peppermint oil, vitamin b & water. Oh and coffee but if you drink coffee often it would make it worse
3232 2018-10-17 18:56:56 Yah kunzima thina esiyabe sisemsebenzini asiyitholi leyo cooking oil because of people abathengisa phandle
3233 2018-10-17 18:56:56 And secondly of all the use non-psychoactive oil the treat epilepsy that doesn’t mean CBD oil that means THC concentrated oil non-psychoactive
3234 2018-10-17 18:56:52 They arrived before it was a country. Over 250 years later they are still immigrants. Their language made them outsiders. The marketing and oil companies made them white. Find out about Americanization of the Cajuns in DARK ROUX. #DVPit #A #LF #OWN
3235 2018-10-17 18:56:51 Nothing wrong with a few guys..... Some oil...... A few stories..... Maybe a jay being passed..... Finger slip, I mean wait wut?!
3236 2018-10-17 18:56:48 So far Oil supplies from #Saudi keeps coming to #US who in turn sells #Arms to #Saudi in return to Massacre #Yemen children & leave them in #Fanine
#JamalKhashoggi can be murdered in #Turkey and the culprit go free
#US has done far worse killings globally in quest for #Oil
3237 2018-10-17 18:56:42 The Saudis bombed NYC. Forget 9/11. DISGRACEFUL. MONEY SHOULDNT BE A PART OF IT. GOING GREEN WILL PUT AN END TO THEIR OIL INFLUENCE!
3238 2018-10-17 18:56:38 Oh, they give a damn, alright ... about Saudi oil money.  This #VileAdministration doesn't give a rat's ass about this reporter.
3239 2018-10-17 18:56:22 Can you list who funds all their work and if they received any personal payments from US organizations?

They would be similar to the ones who pay First Nation residents, to be the torch bearer to block the oil industry
3240 2018-10-17 18:56:18 Well, one, blaming oil specifically as a medium lacks accuracy because private secular and sacred sculpture and vessels were commoditizing bodies well before oil on board was a /thing/. Also slavery was a thing so ???
3241 2018-10-17 18:56:09 Sounds like Steve single-handedly saved the state of NM. He didn’t. He does, however, owe a lot to the oil/gas barons and I’m sure as Governor he’d find ways to pay them back. Don’t ya think?
3242 2018-10-17 18:56:05 Someone always will buy oil.
3243 2018-10-17 18:56:01 And I really don’t believe your story first of all The Way oil was made in the 70s is no wars even close to how it is today
3244 2018-10-17 18:55:53 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
3245 2018-10-17 18:55:51 Oshey oil magnate
3246 2018-10-17 18:55:50 Amarjeet, when are you going to come to Calgary and talk with oil producers that are getting a 50 dollars discount per barrel. When? Rather than spend all your time talking about Cannabis, or other matters that are not in your portfolio, what about the industry you represent?
3247 2018-10-17 18:55:43 Oil paint is going to be the death of me, mentally and physically
3248 2018-10-17 18:55:43 Now that you mention that, I think I may be implicated, too. That refined oil stuff is a fungible commodity, for sure. No telling whose hands have been on it.
3249 2018-10-17 18:55:36 เขียดดด!!! เหงาใช่มั้ยย
3250 2018-10-17 18:55:24 Buy your olive oil directly from the olive farm. Best route to quality and fair price.

3251 2018-10-17 18:55:21 i got weed oil for that
3252 2018-10-17 18:55:17 I fucked up coming to get my oil change without my charger
3253 2018-10-17 18:55:11 Pineapple juice stops coughing. Oil of oregano tabs kills the germs.
3254 2018-10-17 18:55:03 Are you arguing that the chart that you are citing didn’t bottom with oil prices bc that would be horribly wrong.
3255 2018-10-17 18:54:51 even last year, "the season from hell", they did better than any season since 2008-09. So that can't be true.
3256 2018-10-17 18:54:40 Na I can relate. Some of them are very overwhelming. Almost like engine oil or petrol
3257 2018-10-17 18:54:38 This feed is like the BP Oil disaster,, endlessly spilling out LIES and Propaganda,, and it needs to be CAPPED!
3258 2018-10-17 18:54:37 Why after we were aware that the 911 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia were there no planes allowed in the air except the ones provided by Pres Bush to get the Saudi's home, It's the Republican way, Oil is more important than people ?, Vote them out !!!
3259 2018-10-17 18:54:33 i have used cbd oil for aches and pains its best easy on tummy not like advil
3260 2018-10-17 18:54:29 If you also like "all natural" peanut butter, store the jar upsidedown. It's so much easier to mix the oil down into the solids than up through it.
3261 2018-10-17 18:54:26 Save the oil
3262 2018-10-17 18:54:25 I love when customers ask "How did my oil look coming out?"
Like I dunno it looks like old, dark, dirty, sediment filled oil. Just like the last 300 cars I've done this month

I'll tell you when it's rainbows or spiders though
3263 2018-10-17 18:54:18 The Soviets already had oil
3264 2018-10-17 18:54:17 For #NationalPastaDay we have developed a thick, potato based noodle that is cooked in oil and...nope, that's fries nevermind.

3271 2018-10-17 18:53:50 for healthy shiny and fine hair and to increase hair growth use the following methods: one egg.3 tablespoons castor oil. and a teaspoon of vinegar  good night

3273 2018-10-17 18:53:34 Gov picks the winners and losers if you own health care you are doing great if you own metals & oil life sucks. Physics wins out in  the long run if you can stay alive. Shorts are not smarter just closer to the Collusive Beast Fed/Banks/Treasury.
3274 2018-10-17 18:53:29 Why are there so many choices for olive oil?!
3275 2018-10-17 18:53:27 Amarjeet, when are you going to come to Calgary and talk with oil producers that are getting a 50 dollars discount per barrel. When?

3276 2018-10-17 18:53:26 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their coffeemaker broke
3277 2018-10-17 18:53:22 let us know how it goes when we renege on deals many of which negotiated by @uklabour , and Saudi reneges on oil deals
3278 2018-10-17 18:53:22 mine have red koolaid, motor oil, mud, some orange stuff idk whereit came from, glue.. I could go on 
3279 2018-10-17 18:53:20 Taking out of oil set on paper towels to drain topped with a finishing seasoning salt pepper blueberry sugar................. pure deliciousness
3280 2018-10-17 18:53:05 I  specially like Artichoke hearts pickled in Oil . They make great salads or sides
3281 2018-10-17 18:52:52 Momma need a free oil change and new rotors 
3282 2018-10-17 18:52:47 I like the deathproof coffee with butter and coconut oil
3283 2018-10-17 18:52:38 What the US government will and won’t do for oil, huh?
3284 2018-10-17 18:52:36 this is kinda weird but you can use men’s facial hair dye. It should be safe cause it’s for your face. I’ve never tried it but I heard it works. but castor oil works too
3285 2018-10-17 18:52:31 But you'll look like a chemotherapy patient 
3286 2018-10-17 18:52:24 Thats @Emblem_Corp oil btw
3287 2018-10-17 18:52:22 Took myself a little oil bath today wasn’t good at all
3288 2018-10-17 18:52:18 By the way Adrian if we control the oil price and you may pay 9$/gallon and then you will realize you are the one who paid the price because of misjudgment. We can also stop using USD For oil price then no one will need your currency-
3289 2018-10-17 18:52:16 ugh what would i do without coconut oil my hair would be fried to hell and back
3290 2018-10-17 18:52:16 This is great news all the way around Pres.Trump setting all kinds of records jobs, the greatest oil producer in the world. The greatest productive country in the world.
3291 2018-10-17 18:52:14 Cooking oil
3292 2018-10-17 18:52:03 Because he lies with ease. Snake oil salesman just like the guy he doesnt want endorsing him.
3293 2018-10-17 18:52:01 Well, it takes some level of intelligence to appreciate 8000MW over 3000MW,completion of projects over abandoned projects, $47b foreign reserve during oil glut over $29b foreign reserve during a period  of oil boom,payin 15yr-old pensions over refusing to pay NigAirways pensions.
3294 2018-10-17 18:51:52 Just in case the viewers/citizens missed it, the Saudi Arabian government is as brutal and corrupt as any we find in the MidEast.  The oil and its large buys of American weapons help it escape proper scrutiny.  This is not a drill.
3295 2018-10-17 18:51:46 Why does he care,his oil and gas leased properties are doing great and his investments in Czechoslovakian Casinos and hotels through hedge funds are doing better and better.
3296 2018-10-17 18:51:43 Both of mine fell out on their own after a couple of years. Thankfully though most kids grow out of ear infections. I still get them from time to time but I just put warm mineral oil in my ears.

3300 2018-10-17 18:50:51 Neither party can control spending or be accountable for the massive waste and fraud. 
The bigger gov gets, the more there is.
Tom Coburn annually put out his pork barrel list, yet no action is ever taken to rein in over 200 billion in waste. Why?
3301 2018-10-17 18:50:47 The USA has been complicit to the Saudi's for years every administration since they discovered oil. Why is everyone acting surprised? They are Brutal regime that subjugates women gays and non Muslims and anyone who talks bad about the crown.

The fact that Chiarelli is worse at his job than 28 of 30 other NHL GM's is all that matters.
3309 2018-10-17 18:50:08 and then a shout out from the crowd stated well if there is one student black that does "oil" and well if there is one student black that does federal  reserve analyst and well if there one black student who did general mills and consumer packaging unit and what happen to friends
3310 2018-10-17 18:49:59 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3311 2018-10-17 18:49:54 Rinkhals removed in Mnandi this afternoon and the Herald snake I removed in Waterfall as it was stuck to sellotape managed to get it loose by using olive oil and a ear  bud
3312 2018-10-17 18:49:52 Funny how Russian news is only reporting this oh wait the Western world kisses Saudi a$$ and wouldn't want to upset them. Why can't we just invest in renewable sources and stop relying on these corrupt Oil barons disguised as Sheiks and Princes?
3313 2018-10-17 18:49:47 Oil money is sweet to spend...
3314 2018-10-17 18:49:36 My mum just told me I should start taking cannabis oil???
3315 2018-10-17 18:49:34 With all the stuff happening in the middle east, I am kinda happy we pre bought our heating oil.

3320 2018-10-17 18:49:29 I have some peppermint oil tablets from Holland and Barrett which are a lot better for bloating that the tea!!
3321 2018-10-17 18:49:12 Whose pockets? Mine? I don't think so. Regulations streamlined to benefit whom? Oil? Coal? Land developers? Waste dumpers? Certainly not ordinary people. I have NO CONFIDENCE in this corrupt puppet @POTUS .  @larry_kudlow @Varneyco @PressSec
3322 2018-10-17 18:49:11 Aaron, you meant to say “decades” instead of “years”. First Saudi kidnapping on record happened in 1979, under Carter. We have been MARINATED with oil since Roosevelt met with Ibn Abdul Aziz on the USS in the Red Sea. Bipartisan marination w/ oil. Meanwhile, our planet burns.
3323 2018-10-17 18:49:08 When you get in, buy all our oil from Venezuela instead of Saudi So boycotting on an epic scale.

3325 2018-10-17 18:49:05 That's not what white privilege means. You're a willfully ignorant liar and there's no reason to respond to your straw men. Decent people will make the world better without you.
3326 2018-10-17 18:48:59 oil drop is a bear trap imo

3329 2018-10-17 18:48:09 It's a matter of where the olive tree is planted than how the olive oil is made
3330 2018-10-17 18:48:07 US government need just one thing which is our oil..  Exchange of oil with some sort of rubbish goods...
3331 2018-10-17 18:48:06 His eyes almost instantly flashed back to that milky white, hands forced out against her shoulders as the liquid electricity mutated with ugly fashion to that familiar golden glimmer of the Mystic powers. They moved together oil in water, sparking off each other, as he forced ─
3332 2018-10-17 18:48:05 Do y'all do hot oil treatments or oil your scalp? 

If you do hot oil treatments, do you do them before you shampoo or after you shampoo?
3333 2018-10-17 18:48:00 I don’t think I’ve been as stressed out as I am right now in a very long time jeez tired is an understatement. I just want booty rub  with  an essential oil and lit scented candles 
3334 2018-10-17 18:47:55 I'd put in Oil City in 5A. I think Christian Cole is quite a RB.
3335 2018-10-17 18:47:49 Hell I need to get the oil changed on my car too
3336 2018-10-17 18:47:38 We buy their oil and they buy our Treasuries. If the price of oil spikes because of the Saudis cutting supply and/or they stop buying our debt you can welcome the next great recession. Maybe a depression and kiss your lifestyle goodbuy. The ignorance surrounding this is the norm.
3337 2018-10-17 18:47:29 Putting oil in yo bath n you all shaved have you feeling soft af 
3338 2018-10-17 18:47:23 when oil companies with millions of dollars, resources, and support from government are unfettered thanks to denial of climate change, blaming everyday people for not fixing the problem caused by others is insulting and manipulative. who is really responsible? & ya activism helps
3339 2018-10-17 18:47:19 Allah da nam ly yr,,,, dimag m??? Allah pak reham kren, badaam khaya kr, sarson or olive oil use kro,
3340 2018-10-17 18:47:18 Did you finally figure out that those water trucks the oil companies contract for fracking tear up the roads and actually kill people? So now the oil companies are going to build their own new roads? Will they be using taxpayer money to do it? Will they start charging tolls?
3341 2018-10-17 18:47:11 This fixation addictin with cooking oil is really strange. Its not even healthy. I bet all those people have a bottle or bottles of un opened oil in their homes.
3342 2018-10-17 18:47:10 In quitman getting my oil changed and I’m about to fall asleep right in this shop
3343 2018-10-17 18:47:09 C'mon, people!
You must have seen the price of gas.
We used to import from Canada.
Conald D'Rump wants to give Putin a hand, so he shut down Iran, and caused an increase in oil and gas prices, which is HURTING AMERICANS.
3344 2018-10-17 18:47:06 Tell that to the guys working on oil rigs doing hard ass work and working 100+ hours a week. Grow up people.

3349 2018-10-17 18:46:46 No one will do anything about it. We depend on them for oil and after brexit we’ll need all the money they give us for our weapons so they can carry on bombing Yemen and we can try to avoid bankruptcy
3350 2018-10-17 18:46:31 US is linked to Saudi Arabia & Dubai and even China via their  currencies being hard pegged to USD & trade mainly OIL being priced  in USD. Laugh or NOT, you are friends in this game?

3353 2018-10-17 18:46:16 We were discussing this last week. I did it with cumin paprika tumerica oil and lemon. It’s nice. I just can’t be doing with all that cauliflower rice/pastry bollocks.
3354 2018-10-17 18:46:13 I infuse my own olive oil with rosemary from  my garden
3355 2018-10-17 18:46:12 There is actually at least another 50 years of oil.not counting what is in Firth of Clyde .there was a report last week. I know price goes up and down.scotland can survive fine without it but it is a nice wee bonus as Norway has proved.only Uk can’t make money from it. Why?
3356 2018-10-17 18:46:01 Only in America do the oil industry advertise on TV showing all of the things that oil enables us to do 
3357 2018-10-17 18:46:00 coconut oil is TERRIBLE  when i see it in skincare threads i cringe

3360 2018-10-17 18:45:55 It won’t be in my life time, but perhaps in our children’s. That day when the oil runs out and the Arabs return to riding camels, drinking goats milk and eating dates.

3362 2018-10-17 18:45:41 I was advised by my doctor to buy olive oil from clicks or dischem (chemist) and add 2-3 drops in the milk. If that doesn’t work, please consult your doctor.

3367 2018-10-17 18:45:12 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
3368 2018-10-17 18:45:12 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3369 2018-10-17 18:45:11 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

3372 2018-10-17 18:44:58 I'm skeptical. He may be an Intel asset and MBH affiliate. Maybe not. IDK. What is the alternative? Trade/oil war? Embargo with #1 oil producing country and ally in the region. Look at the irrational mon-AM foreign policy experts on twitter. Turkey is not a moral authority.

3374 2018-10-17 18:44:38 True that!
By my rough analysis, there are 6 major “blocks” serving  as sources of Dark Money in  USA politics:
* Big Oil
* Big Wall Street/Banking
* Big Real Estate
* Foreign
* Mob/Crime
* Tech (latest & least organized)

Part of GOP success is partnership w/ 4 of the 6
3375 2018-10-17 18:44:31 Wow the spread between #wti and #Brent oil around $10 now. The #Iran sanctions starting to show.

3376 2018-10-17 18:44:30 You want to attribute all of our economic troubles to oil price collapse but now that prices have rebounded and economy has improved you want to give credit to the gov. Sorry doesnt work that way.
3377 2018-10-17 18:44:23 We've been the top producer of oil in the world for a couple of years now but go ahead and take all the credit, like you normally tried to
3378 2018-10-17 18:44:16 Which is why they are such warmonger. Especially when it comes to the oil rich nations.
3379 2018-10-17 18:44:12 The funny thing about the phrase "data is oil" is nobody ever mentions the world's massive ****ing oil cartel that constrains supply and keeps every producer from going bankrupt.

3388 2018-10-17 18:43:55 Beto wants: NO borders, take down existing walls; raise taxes on oil in TX;  repeal income tax cuts for middle class;  a national health system that “only costs $1.6 trillion a yr” (how is he going to pay for it? Raise Taxes);  imment domaine; repeal child tax credit—disaster!
3389 2018-10-17 18:43:51 Yup. I was going to shoot for billionaire oil baron or just making above average wage author. Dreams.
3390 2018-10-17 18:43:43 How about getting free trade with our Oil! Stop phasing out the pipelines.we are only getting around $25 per barrel for western select !@liberal_party #rippedofff
3391 2018-10-17 18:43:40 Oil is not going anywhere any time soon, I have mentioned petrochemicals are replacing automobile
3392 2018-10-17 18:43:40 My only friend Dante wants me to take a DNA test to find out if I'm actually "an Albanian dog" like he suspects. I said, "No way Jose, Dante. DNA tests are just a bunch of banana oil. I'm made in God's image and that's all I need to know."
3393 2018-10-17 18:43:38 Of the 55 refineries closed in America in the last 10 years, they were all closed for economic reasons, mostly oil company mergers. Not a single one was closed for environmental purposes or objections.

3395 2018-10-17 18:43:34 Are you suggesting there has been no spills or leaks, cos you're not googling hard enough if you are. Check the mess of the US sites, well casings fail, ground cracked and leaking gas and oil, water on fire etc etc. Those disasters!!
3396 2018-10-17 18:43:29 I had no idea that there were 2 oil spills per day in AB. Never heard of the fracking contamination cases. @OilGasCanada would have me believe in a 100% error free rate with fracking? Clueless about level of @YourAlberta complicity with industry. All pol parties captive.
3397 2018-10-17 18:43:22 Except United won everything b4 hand... Without sacking managers and oil money... They have won the lot already, so what if someone wants to take over.... Better than the owners we have atm no?
3398 2018-10-17 18:43:16 I might be mistaken but I think those valve covers are going to leak a little oil. 
3399 2018-10-17 18:43:14 fair, and the domestic slowdown should weigh on many components of core inflation.  on the other hand, the rise in oil + a weaker yuan would work in the other way on headline, if the full increase in global prices is passed through
3400 2018-10-17 18:43:11 Don’t you really mean that the oil/gas barons would like another tax cut only this time at the state level. Yeah I see your ideas to bring stable, long-term jobs to NM - NOT! It’s those unstable boom and bust jobs that float your boat, right Stevie?

3412 2018-10-17 18:42:33 This is why we need to get away from oil and become a leader in renewable energy. And for those that say we can have to do it that quickly, you don't know history we did it in WW2 turning car factories into airplane building factories. In less than a year. It can be done!!
3413 2018-10-17 18:42:28 Spot on!Why should we give a shit about a Saudi,Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer?Why should we cancel a $480bill trade deal & risk a Saudi/Russian alliance to hike oil prices?
3414 2018-10-17 18:42:17 Time to get a grip on oil prices. My tax relief is going in my gas and heating oil tank.

3419 2018-10-17 18:41:44 You get to hedge on the price by receiving your payment now, and speculators get to gamble and hoard...without affecting stocks I'm shops. In 2 months time you produce 15% more cooking oil.

Could be done for so many commodities.

3435 2018-10-17 18:40:17 What should we do first? Accuse them of evil without absolute evidence? Enforce sanctions against Saudi Arabia which they will counter with increased oil prices, you don't mind paying more for gas this winter? Cancel huge arms deal that will cost jobs and influence in the region?

3442 2018-10-17 18:39:43 So much speculation in Zimbabwe. We need to tap into it in a productive manner by developing commodity exchanges tailored to the small-scale nature of the trading. 

Imagine having a platform for auctioning off say 15% of the cooking oil you will produce in 2 months.
3443 2018-10-17 18:39:38 If there is a monopoly there is no innovation.

3445 2018-10-17 18:39:25 the last time i used a fat burner, it worked so well, i looked so thin and i want to get on another one again but almost all of them have some sort of fish oil or animal product in it. 

anyone use an accidentally vegan fat burner? did it work? how much / where to buy?

thanks
3446 2018-10-17 18:39:24 Think it’s time for shower and coconut oil 
3447 2018-10-17 18:39:16 Cbd oil! Highly highly recommend it!
3448 2018-10-17 18:39:16 Capacity isn’t oil
3449 2018-10-17 18:39:12 Idk who’s daughter needed to hear this but take your car in for an oil change already and other maintenance work
3450 2018-10-17 18:39:09 I’m not trying to have my baby in the parking lot  but I’m going to go buy the ball and the oil and see if something happens I’m praying bc I’m tired of being pregnant
3451 2018-10-17 18:39:05 I'm all for it. We have plenty of land and loads of resources and another oil field sounds great, IF Alaskans got first dibs at the jobs.
3452 2018-10-17 18:38:54 This real? Beautiful Edmonton bridge. Nothing to do with oil
3453 2018-10-17 18:38:53 PVA sizeみんな使ってるのかな？primed canvas の上に使うのかい？oil groundは？
3454 2018-10-17 18:38:42 Our players need financial sponsorship not boxes of cooking oil. Sunfoil sponsors SA cricket, they've never handed boxes of cooking oil in front of the whole world to the Proteas. It's undignifying seriously 
3455 2018-10-17 18:38:29 @BrookeBCNN What a shame and hypocrisy. Its not only Trump who is in love with Saudis, all administrations whether Republicans or Democrats, all of them in love with Saudis, because of oil and the regional interests.
3456 2018-10-17 18:38:24 How do people avoid being burned from hot oil? I see people standing so close to the stove and don't even jump back or anything and I'm like what kind of witchcraft is this?
3457 2018-10-17 18:38:22 Consider the cozy nature of the U.S. government with Saudi Arabia, and why we've waited until Elon Musk comes around and wakes up the auto industry to an alternative to oil. Corrupt U.S. government has been complicit in allowing SA to put the oil noose around our neck.
3458 2018-10-17 18:38:21 Does anybody have tips for keeping hair from drying out? I have hair oil and non sulfate products, wash every other day, condition every day. 

My hair is just a black hole for moisture. 

I also have to shower with hot water every day to keep my scalp from scaling.
3459 2018-10-17 18:38:13 Good job he didn’t demonstrate against fracking and come up against a biased judge whose family have links to the oil industry he would be in prison
3460 2018-10-17 18:38:05 Awesome recipe: My mom's chewy soup.  Ingredients: undiluted coffee cream, worcestershire sauce, and oil.
3461 2018-10-17 18:38:00 I took a black cab once a month ago when desperate and now my stupid brain thinks they’re a legitimate form of transport. I’ve been through this before with Tesco Finest Olive Oil - it doesn’t end well.
3462 2018-10-17 18:37:48 @BrookeBCNN Brook, we all know it's all about OIL and Saudi Money.
OIL and MONEY, Trump's favorite cologne!
3463 2018-10-17 18:37:45 Lavender essential oil with coconut oil and Aloe Vera
3464 2018-10-17 18:37:42 I WILL tell you they are Patriots compared to weak-kneed, hand kissing, wanna-be leaders like former President Obama who DID surrender this country to the Russians w/Hillary via Uranium 1 and happily appeased Total Oil (Rockefeller) with Iran Deal that funded terrorism.  Traitors
3465 2018-10-17 18:37:40 Well oil prices above $50 are one difference...
3466 2018-10-17 18:37:38 Utter drivel. Norway produces oil. Scotland produces oil. Ghana produces oil etc etc etc etc
3467 2018-10-17 18:37:29 Go buy snake oil and rub it on your arm like satchel page. If you did that during your career you’d probably be starting game 5 for the dodgers right now
3468 2018-10-17 18:37:26 And ppl expected our economy to grow via the claiming economist. Manifesto said new revenues via SEZ, I-Haven, Oil, but nothing materialised. 
Instead loans and corruption increased. 
Hence ppl said NO
3469 2018-10-17 18:37:13 45 years ago, in 1973, the Saudis imposed an oil embargo on the US. It scared them shitless. It resulted in a mad dash to exploit as much of their own as possible. It also prompted the 55mph speed limit, still in force today. What short memories some people have ...
3470 2018-10-17 18:37:11 people are so fucking inconvenient. yes i have a fucking mirror i know my lips are peeling. i have no fucking control over it, doesn't matter how much oil and aquaphor i put on it. stop pointing out thing in people's faces and bodies it's literally none of your business, idk you

3477 2018-10-17 18:36:30 #ImpeachTrump #Republicans Fucking hypocritics.  Iraq war will be paid with oil, tax cuts pay for itself, lying fuckers.  They are not entitlements, WE pay for it in every check.  REPUBLICANS ARE ROBBING US FOR TAX CUTS THAT ONLY TO THE RICH
3478 2018-10-17 18:36:25 The Scott's want to put us back in the eu why would you want to give all your fishing  grounds back to the European union  then  scotland o buy the way they won't stop there they want your gas and oil to and any other assets scotland is willing to give away they will take the lot
3479 2018-10-17 18:36:19 And sprays you with oil
3480 2018-10-17 18:36:15 Oh no,a coal mine. I guess nothing is going to be done. I know we can't really get off Saudi oil. Or maybe I should say governments won't do it. Too politically toxic. Politicians think short term & get theirs while they can.
3481 2018-10-17 18:36:10 ... could be wrong but the moment we pay the whole soccer national team with cooking oil and petrol, that removes any doubt that for Zimbabweans, we are already re-living the memories of 2008...
3482 2018-10-17 18:36:05 Oil comes from fossilized plants and microscopic organisms. Gasoline comes from oil. Cars are powered by gasoline. Therefore, cars are basically vegetarians.
3483 2018-10-17 18:36:04 So(allegedly!!) the Saudis will construct some fable about the embassy,ahem, "interrogation", find some poor minor "rogue" officials to heap all the blame on,punish them to be rid of them then proceed on with the usual huge arms and oil deals as if no one was brutally killed...
3484 2018-10-17 18:36:03 FG gave me $40m to halt oil flow disruption in N/D, not contract – Robert, GEJ’s cousin
3485 2018-10-17 18:35:44 @glennbeck argument i was always told was saudi royals keep the wahabists in line so if we dump them we destabilize a major steadying middle eastern nation a la egypt and syria. 

imho drain ME oil then use our own. strategic initiative.
better let russia have last SA dregs
3486 2018-10-17 18:35:35 Easy .60cents or ticks on #oott $cl_f #oil 1 contract $600 3-$1800 5-3,000 not bad way to make a living..#everyday even for those with small account
3487 2018-10-17 18:35:33 I lived w my Gram in college & when we did popcorn for Must See TV we went old school. Oil, kernels, & a pan w a lid.
3488 2018-10-17 18:35:15 But...oil.
3489 2018-10-17 18:35:12 Weed not oil. 

Peace 
3490 2018-10-17 18:35:01 Best thing for the world would be to pump out that oil as fast as possible and then close the borders and let them fight it out among each other.

Well, that's the second best. Best would be deep nuclear bomb 'tests' to make all the Gulf oil immediately radioactive and unusable.
3491 2018-10-17 18:35:01 Love to try them @NestleUKI when you're removed palm oil from your product ranges
3492 2018-10-17 18:35:01 How about getting free trade with our Oil!
Stop phasing out the pipelines. @liberal_party
3493 2018-10-17 18:35:00 Haha facts and this administration oil and water
3494 2018-10-17 18:34:58 I want peppermint and jojoba oil for my hair :(
3495 2018-10-17 18:34:47 What answers. It was all empty rhetoric and stale lies. She got shown up for the snake oil sales woman she is.
3496 2018-10-17 18:34:47 Are you using oil or watercolor? And what brand do you use?
3497 2018-10-17 18:34:41 In the past week I have purchased acupuncture needles and mineral oil (available in a *very* large bottle in the laxative aisle at the pharmacy) and have researched and trialed behavior analysis software, all for the lab. I can't wait to see the targeted ads in my facebook feed.
3498 2018-10-17 18:34:29 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

3500 2018-10-17 18:34:11 Oil sinks 3%, settling at $69.75, after big rise in US crude stockpiles.

3502 2018-10-17 18:34:09 Oil??? idk
3503 2018-10-17 18:34:05 Everyone tracks Poppy Bush and his robo-call Rolodex. They don't get that Barbara Bush strolled into a needlepoint shop in Houston and had an instant, worldwide, oil wives rolodex, without even trying too hard. That's just one city.
3504 2018-10-17 18:34:04 And if the bribes don't work shutting off oil production will.
3505 2018-10-17 18:34:00 @SenJohnKennedy Demanding MBS to step down from crown prince won’t cause world war 3! I’m sorry but that’s insane. Just like your Big Oil financed simplistic view of the Middle East.
3506 2018-10-17 18:33:58 The one half moral argument for fracking is we needn’t buy our planet-destroying energy source from mass murderers anymore. That conservatives never actually make that argument shows how in hock to both the oil lobby and military industrial complex they are. #C4News #SaudiArabia
3507 2018-10-17 18:33:54 some air wick essential oil....forget the name of it.
3508 2018-10-17 18:33:52 Of course they will. Oil and the money it brings to pay for arms buys a lot of friendship.
3509 2018-10-17 18:33:49 US to produce 14M barrels of oil a day by 2020
3510 2018-10-17 18:33:46 Bit pointless. The activists win condition is just favouring one oil/gas company over another. Doesn't do anything in the grand scheme of things. Caudrilla lose and another wins etc. No big deal really.
3511 2018-10-17 18:33:45 As long as it's served with a nice olive oil, aged parm, and lots of pepper
3512 2018-10-17 18:33:41 You can really get some pine cones and scent them with like cinnamon oil or buy the pine cones that’s pre scented 
3513 2018-10-17 18:33:39 Hehe yg cosmoderm tu tak drying. Tapi ada sandalwood oil so kena be careful. I pakai muka jadi bright gila tapi naik rashes sbb that oil :(
3514 2018-10-17 18:33:37 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
3515 2018-10-17 18:33:37 I had this same problem but the hydrating evening cream by derma-e w/ grapeseed oil on top to seal in the moisture has helped me so much. That’s my current go-to
3516 2018-10-17 18:33:33 Breaking (2:33 PM EDT): Oil sinks 3%, settling at $69.75, after big rise in US crude stockpiles -- CNBC
3517 2018-10-17 18:33:31 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
3518 2018-10-17 18:33:23 Interesting to see that #Crude inventories building up (and #WTI oil prices falling to reflect it) but #NattyGas prices remains strong with $NG_F prices is at a level not seen since mid 2017 (with the exception of a one day blip in February this year).
3519 2018-10-17 18:33:20 The only way they can make life unpleasant is in that annexing their oil fields will disrupt production and cause a price spike.
3520 2018-10-17 18:33:11 Behave Yaseer kar inyi Allah ya isa 
3521 2018-10-17 18:33:09 The next time you fill up your big gas guzzler, think about the two biggest oil exporting countries and what they stand for, Saudi Arabia and Russia.
3522 2018-10-17 18:33:02 Watch oil...
3523 2018-10-17 18:33:02 Whoa! This is a news flash that 99% of us already know!
"market metrics" schmedrics every time oil goes up everything else goes up too
When oil prices go down NOTHING goes back down equally
Gov'ts get their  taxes! Companies GOUGE !
THIS IS NOT BREAKING NEWS
3524 2018-10-17 18:32:57 2/The recent Abacus Data poll quoted in yesteday's column shows that only 13% of Canadians "hate" oil, while 15% "love" it and the rest sit in the pragmatic centre, not engaged in debate but understanding oil's role in modern economy. Again, where's the beef?
3525 2018-10-17 18:32:56 Climate change is fundamentally connected to environmental justice issues--from industrial farming to our reliance on cars which are typically jammed in traffic on highways near black and brown communities, to the construction of oil and gas pipelines. #Scalawagchats
3526 2018-10-17 18:32:48 Well, there goes all the freshwater fish & wildlife relying on our rivers and streams. Between the Coal sludge & oil that @realDonaldTrump and @EPA will send into our waters, we will all be poisoned daily. That crap goes into the soil, too. But hey, it’s profitable for trump.

3533 2018-10-17 18:32:15 Wait so people actually believe that dinosaur fossils made coal, oil and natural gas and that injecting yourself with influenza makes you healthier?
3534 2018-10-17 18:32:06 Oil is a commodity that flows where it needs to.  An Indian refiner might load Texas crude and bring it back to India for refining even though the gulf is closer.  You can only really see energy on imports vs exports. The US is a massive net energy importer.
3535 2018-10-17 18:31:55 June 2015 - 9,914 Fracked Oil Wells in North Dakota produced 34,588,248 barrels of oil.

June 2018 - 12,278 Fracked Oil Wells in North Dakota produced 35,185,722 barrels of oil.

A 23.8% increase in producing wells led to a 1.73% increase in oil.

When halfway done turn down the heat.

 or...
 
use cast iron
3537 2018-10-17 18:31:45 Im no expert but a leak no matter what rather it be oil or water is a possibility I’d rather it be water. As for a carbon footprint, the world is leading towards natural and clean energy so there is or will be a way to make it work. Piping oil is where the criticism should be.

3540 2018-10-17 18:31:31 My poor granny had her garden set a light last night and nearly had her oil tank blown up, just for some scumbag to have a “laugh”
3541 2018-10-17 18:31:27 The Saudis will just sit back and laugh. What are Western Governments going to do? Without Saudi money many football teams will collapse, the arms industry will collapse as will western civilisation when the Saudis switch off the oil taps leading of course to war.
3542 2018-10-17 18:31:18 It’s good. It’s mostly pumpkin. Has chickpeas oil and tahini but doesn’t taste like hummus
3543 2018-10-17 18:31:11 And it won't be oil!
3544 2018-10-17 18:30:56 Well for starters one believes in the climate science and the other doesn't. One supports pollution pricing and the other doesn't. One shut down coal in Ontario and the other didn't. The BC NDP support LNG but oppose the oil sands, while the ABNDP support the oil sands...
3545 2018-10-17 18:30:54 I don't think we should blow up the entire Saudi relationship, it is too important to Israel and in our dealings with Iran. But the costs of our relationship are increasing at a time when we don't need their oil as we used to. I was a fan of Obama's chilling of the relationship.
3546 2018-10-17 18:30:48 Lol haaa so is it important to use oil when checking for a lump?
3547 2018-10-17 18:30:39 my cars been at the shop for 2 days and i’ve literally heard zero updates on it so far. each time i called it went to voicemail. this is my last day of waiting before i go and take that shit back. kind of crazy for an oil leak..

3551 2018-10-17 18:30:19 Because AB relies on oil. I am not denying that our economy shrunk way more than Sask. The problem is that our rebounded better because of oil prices and the NDP policies of stimulation. Sask did the opposite and failed.
3552 2018-10-17 18:30:15 Knute Buehler has a dismal 43% lifetime rating from @OLCV.

3553 2018-10-17 18:30:13 So I don't know actually. It's weird. The Harper guy was similarly dogmatic about this BS. I'm wondering if the oil industry folks @OilGasCanada can't make money with the added bonus of the C tax? I mean it isn't enough to get free water for fracking, subsidy, no polluter pay?

3559 2018-10-17 18:29:25 So, my oil change is $250gladly.
3560 2018-10-17 18:29:17 Climate change is real. Past time to get serious about renewable energy. Oil and gas should be a thing of the past.
3561 2018-10-17 18:29:17 Saudi controls the Petrodollar - you are missing the mark -  Canada supplies heavy oil for transport ie Diesel (for now) - the USA is its own largest supplier - USA buys oil from Saudi as a means to keep petrodollar as the reserve currency.

Oil folks have enough money to control every politician in Washington ...and Brussels.

Except a geriatric billionaire.

3576 2018-10-17 18:27:52 You just put yourself into a very challenging situation because of the properties of stainless steel. I'd say in the end you will have a lower rate is success, by the way just use some canola or Olive oil, and be prepared to a different taste :)
3577 2018-10-17 18:27:48 We introduced Technology 10 years ago to clean up waste water for Oil & Gas Industry. What Happened: Govnr Rick Perry and the Big Oil Lobbyist Shut It Down..Reason: Cost to Much! Go Figure
3578 2018-10-17 18:27:47 Not sure. Have you tried Lavendar oil? A few drops near your pillow.
3579 2018-10-17 18:27:45 One of the challenges of course is that graphene-enhanced solar will keep the oil and gas sequestered in the ground... ;-)
3580 2018-10-17 18:27:29 and also be careful about what you made for dinner. Oil from hot peppers can be a real pain in the hooha.

3587 2018-10-17 18:26:37 Nope! Your increasing profits for corporations, while destroying our environment, and making workers less safe! America should be a leader in the transfer to clean energy! Instead because you & @GOP are in big oil's pocket, and poisoning the earth for your own short term gain!

Короче, суть такая: я читала мангу бнха онгоингом, но потом началась в моей жизни запара полная, и суть в том, что я потеряла главу, на которой закончила читать.

3593 2018-10-17 18:26:11 I quit smoking a year and a half ago after seriously thinking I was going to die one day. And now I take CBD oil daily for arthritis, and it helps. So, tobacco can suck it.
3594 2018-10-17 18:26:09 No prob. Initially tRump suggested that we reopen old oil pipelines right, which isn’t good for the environment. Agreed. I’m suggesting that we dig canals and pipe up or around the elevations. The Great Lakes reservoir is enough to submerge the entire country under 8ft of water.
3595 2018-10-17 18:25:48 #hempworx #cbdoil #pain #anxiety there are so many benefits and uses for cbd oil. When you go to the doctor and get your prescriptions can you say the same.

3618 2018-10-17 18:23:45 Saudi Arabia's government haven't done anything to stop terrorism and they purchase our weapons to use them later on us, usually in selling to terrorist. I've been aware of this for the last 30 yrs. Why are their government so beholding to our government? Oil?
3619 2018-10-17 18:23:45 $41.95 for a fucking oil change. Between a $180 ticket and this, I'm getting low on cash for this month.

3623 2018-10-17 18:23:36 Looks like an ugly close in the oil space
3624 2018-10-17 18:23:34 As Saudi Arabia threatens massive economic reprisals against the US if held to account for the disappearance of a WaPo columnist, a friendly reminder that the Trump administration formally labeled America's top source of imported oil, Canada, a threat to national security...
3625 2018-10-17 18:23:33 I was under a mistaken impression America was self-sufficient in oil production.

3630 2018-10-17 18:23:14 Yeah, that killing and dismembering of Journalists is a real inconvenience.   Truth is Saudi behavior has gotten more aggressive in multiple ways in recent past.  Yemen is a good case in point.  They are using Iran and oil to shame America (not just Trump) into silence
3631 2018-10-17 18:23:11 A slippery slope while wearing baby oil! Great post Chris.

3634 2018-10-17 18:23:00 Judge Robert Altham jailed fracking protestors. Judge Robert Altham's family business supplies the oil industry. His sister wrote a sponsored (cuadrilla) letter in support of Fracking.  No bias there then. Impartial and honest that man! #dirtyrottenscoundrel
3635 2018-10-17 18:22:58 Our government and other are shit scared to stand up to Saudi Arabia and all because of oil .

3690 2018-10-17 18:18:05 The Saudis are a real embodiment of evil. Look at the thousands of children theyre intentionally starving in Yemen. And America is supporting them.

Huge deficits need to be paid.  Our economy is at risk which puts our country is at risk.
3713 2018-10-17 18:16:10 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is simply a land grab from a very wealth authoratarian family.  It would fall apart if the US stopped buy their oil and selling them weapons.  We don't need them.  Let's let this Wahabist family fade into the annuals of history.

3717 2018-10-17 18:15:59 The economic damage from strikes in the oil sector (which is >70% of Iranian exports) would be in a different league than strikes in retail, trucking, and the public sector.
3718 2018-10-17 18:15:58 Nothing could be dirtier than the heavy stench of rancid fat drifting from our local drive through KFC.  Try changing the oil in your fryers more than once every month.
3719 2018-10-17 18:15:49 Your information you gave today on moisturiser for oily skin was totally incorrect, as a therapist we constantly fight against the belief that if you have oily skin you don’t moisturise YOU SHOULD, oil is not moisture

3722 2018-10-17 18:15:34 Сны мне снятся когда прикольные, а когда дичь дичью. Иногда, просто готовый сюжет для ФФ, а иногда такое чувство, что это сон наркомана. 
Недосып переношу нормально, то есть ощущаю себя нормально, но вот если это ПЕРЕсып, то пиши пропало. Я просто словно живой зомбак.
3723 2018-10-17 18:15:27 @Cheesecake please make sure ur cooks, waiters & managers know your menu. Ordered honey truffle chicken 
Extra sauce, Got no sauce,  then they bring plain truffle oil. Then oil with butter. Never got the honey flavor, Was so upset I forced ate part of the dry chicken & left 
3724 2018-10-17 18:15:22 Senator Warren will need more then ads to pickup her slumping showing , Running and telling us she is Indian is a no win. She used it a few times to many . She should go back to her snake oil treatment .That may work

3727 2018-10-17 18:15:11 Death of Saudi journalist. Trump fears stepping on Saudi toes. 80% US oil comes from there.

3729 2018-10-17 18:15:09 Simply political maneuvering in the upcoming fight for speaker, nothing more.

3731 2018-10-17 18:15:05 It’s is, while the antioxidants are true to be present in olive oil, the skin on the breast is too thick for its penetration, plus breasts sag in response to gravity not skin elasticity
3732 2018-10-17 18:14:59 You can also argue we paid for it a second time when Westminster grabbed oil in Scottish waters to spend on its own interests, and squander on eradicating democratic institutions it still dislikes, such as collective bargaining by unions.
Hope that filled in your blanks....
3733 2018-10-17 18:14:56 Dear America,
We DO NOT depend on Saudi Arabia for oil. We depend on Saudi Arabia for *oil prices*. WE would do alright without them; maybe better. However, @realDonaldTrump would probably be fucked.
,
LocalGov
3734 2018-10-17 18:14:54 Btw I think the issue is Saudi Arabia is a force issue to try to derail Trumps progress. If he retaliates we risk oil price increase like in the 70s and if he doesn't the left will call him a coward. Its kinda a no win
3735 2018-10-17 18:14:49 HIPSTER EVOLUTION
I don't feel manly.
I'll grow a beard and pretend I'm a lumberjack.
No still don't feel manly.
More beard oil.
Nope still not feeling it.
Must be foreigners/women/gays/trans/liberals fault.
Ooh think I'm getting a semi.
Hitler was right.
Now I'm feeling it.....
3736 2018-10-17 18:14:38 So we can agree that NI is a net beneficiary of the UK and UK govt still want to keep it. So why is it strange that they would want to keep Scotland? During the 1980s we were net contributer because of the oil. But it has only ever been because of the oil. But not now.
3737 2018-10-17 18:14:36 There is absolutely no doubt who killed #Khashoggi. Every ‘investigation’ going on now is just a smokescreen to find the least-damaging explanation that will keep the $110 billion arms deal intact & Saudi oil flowing. Hold not thy breath, people! @washingtonpost @CNN @BBCWorld
3738 2018-10-17 18:14:32 I don’t think we sell oil to finance high sales numbers of EV, but you can enlighten me?
3739 2018-10-17 18:14:28 CT has done that for awhile. All the utilities offer the option and it goes to an independent non-profit that provides grants to folks who need assistance with utility bill. it can also be used for oil/gas/other heat sources even if it was donated to the electric utility
3740 2018-10-17 18:14:28 People who lived in Saskatchewan in the 30s: During the Depression there was no rain and we had to eat burlap!
People in Saskatchewan now: Climate breakdown won't affect us. More oil please!
3741 2018-10-17 18:14:27 Along with the Pitchforks and Guillotines, can we build battery & solar panel factories in all cities to allow us to stop buying oil from these MFers?  And I don't just mean Saudi Arabia, but also the Goon Squad for Exxon who kiss the ring of MBS and Trump.

3742 2018-10-17 18:14:23 The fashion industry is said to be the 2nd biggest harm to the environment just after oil... Yes it’s bad but people force it down peoples throat when other, more significant issues are ignored 
3743 2018-10-17 18:14:20 Its very likely that the ladies were stock piling the cooking oil 4 cross border trading. The other day I saw thousands of cartons of brown sugar at Roadport being loaded onto cross border buses.

3746 2018-10-17 18:14:16 America has to get off of her dependency of sacrificing our morals. Also oil.
3747 2018-10-17 18:14:03 There are more jobs in renewables than in oil, by far, for the same investment. It's not even a competition. If we really cared about employment, we'd invest in renewables and retraining.

3751 2018-10-17 18:13:25 This raises a point that seems to be missing in the current discussions about cannabis: isn't CBD an oil that contains no or very little THC, which is the chemical that provides the high in cannabis? Why would someone using that (usually for medical reasons) be considered...

Arabia  imports  everything.. they  are not  a  manufacturing  country.. that  country is made of  sand.. they  are  totally  dependent on  the  WESt..

"We already have nothing! Now we are giving our last rations of oil?" 

The harsh whispering of an elderly woman resulted in those around her angrily shushing her words. They knew the consequences that came from >
3755 2018-10-17 18:13:02 Majority of oil/gas imported is from Norway. Saudi - we import 5%. 83% of all arms exports go to Saudi - sizeable chunk. Major British companies are dlivering service industries and infrastructure projects in SA. Therefore the relationship seems stronger than these figures?
3756 2018-10-17 18:13:02 probably, it is taken as read!

3761 2018-10-17 18:12:44 Because the American government is in their pocket, what's the worst thats gonna happen? Trump already said that their oil/trade is more valuable than a person's life. I'm sure trump will give them a stern "warning"
3762 2018-10-17 18:12:41 Saudi Arabia is a United States and will remain united, Jews will know that they can no longer save the criminal regime of Iran, this maze no longer responds. The full oil sanctions will be implemented, and with all power on November 4th. game over
3763 2018-10-17 18:12:30 That’s a rhetorical question I take it.  #TheArchers
3764 2018-10-17 18:12:27 The U.S. has been the largest producer of oil and natural gas since 2011. You act as though this just happened. Again, you claim Obamas success.

3773 2018-10-17 18:11:50 Actually you're wrong. The greedy US oil companies have been holding out for the oil they gather in other countries while keeping much of US Oil plugs shut off to manipulate prices in the US. nOw they have a better deal for the US & booing in gas market.

As a vet, I point out they can’t even stop the cyber-attacks on American citizens (ie, government). They join as mercenaries for oil companies. Feh.

3794 2018-10-17 18:10:38 It's the result of the elite slowly losing power in the U.S. and are now moving on to other places they can operate. Brazil is a likely candidate given it's weak economy and abundance of corrupt officials. And oil of course

Trump purposely ignited Iran more by breaking deal

3832 2018-10-17 18:07:35 Is there really a lick of day light between Saudi Arabia and Iran? One Sunni and the other Shiite. Saudi Arabia with it’s slick diplomacy and oil wealth has kept the thrall of American leaders.
3833 2018-10-17 18:07:27 More like 4 or 5 decades.

Imagine if the US response to the 1973 oil shock had been a sustained R&D push to reduce dependency on oil. The Saudis would be irrelevant by now.

3849 2018-10-17 18:05:07 2/ For ordinary real asset, yes, a unit of acct would be necessary.  But as u know, gold & oil are special - the only two assets that have backed reserve currencies over the past 300+ yrs.  That makes an arb between the 2 special, & makes a unit of acct unnecessary in this case.

3851 2018-10-17 18:05:05 @BarackObama Because of what Merck Global Finance and OPEC did to you black people may never get into the government again. You probably should not have been president because you did not know where you went in Florida is two days from the oil disaster
3852 2018-10-17 18:05:05 So move on, snowflake. You've made no arguments, just flung insults at me based on your partisan bias. YOU played the victim card with that "libs want to punish white people!" bullshit. You're a tool, not a thinker.

3858 2018-10-17 18:04:46 Don't really know but am sure it's less than what it was back then, and that's why he had to divert the economy off crude oil. Agriculture is number one sector that is generating more funds than  crude oil? Hope you know that?

3860 2018-10-17 18:04:43 I started out as a No on 112 person  and I'm now a pretty militant YES on 112 person. If the policy conversations with enviro experts hadn't convinced me, the onslaught of dishonest attack ads from oil and gas sure as hell would have.
3861 2018-10-17 18:04:39 Heh, I only know what Labneh is thanks to my old Lebanese coworker, hehe... he used to make a spread with it, with Mint leaves, tomato, and olive oil... tasted very exotic
3862 2018-10-17 18:04:34 This is good food.During my time at University of Zhara,Mt Problems Hungerland it was raw cabbage with no cooking oil or salt.This looks like hotel food compared to my time there but don’t get me wrong I am not saying that this is ok.

3867 2018-10-17 18:04:19 Use tee tree oil after washing your face at night! It kills the bacteria, shrinks your pores, and it doesn’t feel oily.

3875 2018-10-17 18:03:26 We will be at the mercy of those who own oil until we come up with a viable alternative. We have limited our options to violence or appeasement
3876 2018-10-17 18:03:18 Though i dont think Total oil is wodely used here. Total oil is expensive along with castrol, i dont think bodabodas would purchase 1 litter for over 10000, while they can get other brands at 5000tsh . So companies also have their niche.

Nobody needs oil that badly, that an alternative couldn't be found.

3882 2018-10-17 18:02:44 Any cooking oil- Put some on a paper towel and let it sit on the glue for a few mins while the oil works to dissolve the glue. I’ve done this many times, and it actually worked for me
3883 2018-10-17 18:02:41 No actually he is trying to protect everyone's interests. I appreciate for a lot of people it's a hard concept to grasp but the Saudis supply a lot of the world's oil.
Saudi insiders say if Sanctions are imposed Saudi Arabia "could" push oil to $400 a barrel

3885 2018-10-17 18:02:36 Both parties are hostage to it. One because the continuance of the Monarchy depends on it, the Democratic Republic because it had prostituted its values for oil. 
3886 2018-10-17 18:02:13 Nothing at all to do with Saudi arms deals and oil. Right? Or that whole 45th floor in Trump tower?
3887 2018-10-17 18:02:12 Drive allllll the way to Wichita falls to pick up some oil and nobody is here.  I love my job.

3892 2018-10-17 18:01:53 This is not an ad hominem attack. I pointed out a racist analogy that Cliff made. His flawed arguments have been debunked time and time again, like last night at the UW debate where Big Oil leaned on Cliff as their UW expert to prop up their similarly terrible arguments.
3893 2018-10-17 18:01:53 Instead of showing us where is sugar, mazoe, cooking oil and fuel you are getting angry. Your tone confirm the country is super dry. Literally dry.
3894 2018-10-17 18:01:52 I can say another 4 more years of Trudeau will result in a mass exodus of Business in Alberta.  I've heard it many times. Not talking big transnational oil. That left a long time ago, we're talking about native Albertans , the back nine of the economy.
3895 2018-10-17 18:01:45 So why do we oil from the Mid East?

3898 2018-10-17 18:01:25 Time to come clean about advanced technology and put big oil to bed once and for all. For the betterment of the whole world.!!!
3899 2018-10-17 18:01:25 Spinning what? Ask those on ground if cooking oil isn’t available! Business pple are creating artificial shortages simple,,,...where I’m now cooking oil is there ,,,as I’m typing all N Richards shops received cooking oil
3900 2018-10-17 18:01:14 I have little doubt that the CIA and Trump both knew about the plan in advance. KSA is a vassal state designed to help the US and its allies launder money, using the sale of oil to consumers, through a system of bribery and the MIC, and into the pockets of the rich and powerful.

3903 2018-10-17 18:01:03 The federal government has been taking social security funds for years without paying it back, hence stealing it. It’s time Big Oil, Big Pharma, & wealthy investors pay fair taxes just like workers do. And remove the cap.

3910 2018-10-17 18:00:43 Hey trump admin, if you really want to hold Saudi accountable, stop sending them weapons and giving them our oil money. Oh, and you can remind them that we saved their butts during the gulf war.
3911 2018-10-17 18:00:40 from Nov 1st medical canabis oil is avail on prescription in the UK,I heard.
3912 2018-10-17 18:00:35 You bully yourselves. It's hysterical. You don't believe that women are human beings, despite having a mother, you treat females as property.

3915 2018-10-17 18:00:24 My guess is that will say we need the oil and that the Saudis aren't terrorists not aware  that most of the terrorists from 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. Or they don't believe that because Trump told them they were not involved.

3932 2018-10-17 17:59:06 Moving away from oil will diminish the impact and importance of these ruling families.  By virtue of their geographical location they have become enriched and empowered.  They were neither royal nor global influences before oil was discovered beneath the sands they reside upon.
3933 2018-10-17 17:59:06 The White Fuel sigh was neon and the “oil” would start up the tower and splash out from the top, over and over.

3935 2018-10-17 17:59:03 Looks like a good day to work on something in the shop and leave the fields be. Those wet days were always days we cleaned tools, or swept floors, or gave oil changes to vehicles.

3941 2018-10-17 17:58:14 When a rich black man has the cops called on him for entering his own home, or gets stopped by a cop because his car is too nice and must be stolen, that's due to his race, not his class. White people never experience things like this because they're white.
3942 2018-10-17 17:58:14 I guess we’ll see  I’ll hedge bets on higher oil prices in the meantime

3945 2018-10-17 17:58:05 Oil price .... North Sea investments. Scotland slightly behind rest of UK growth, now slightly ahead as oil price & drilling licences very recently increase. Fall from 2014 in particular driven down by N.Sea retraction.
3946 2018-10-17 17:58:05 Just showed how uncool I am, calling a dispensary and asking if they had any THC-free CBD oil.
3947 2018-10-17 17:57:47 Will it be available for oil king games as well?

3950 2018-10-17 17:57:33 Blocking the Keystone XL pipeline entirely is the mirror action to refusing to even consider gun regulation. Oil will be transported somehow and guns will be acquired somehow.

3951 2018-10-17 17:57:24 There has been a long standing allegiance to Saudi Arabia for no other reason than oil that I can see.

3959 2018-10-17 17:56:15 If you’ve ever wondered why all Italian people have oily skin, it’s because we cleanse and moisturize our skin with extra virgin olive oil every day.

3962 2018-10-17 17:56:06 I don’t know how many times I’ve been asked if I’ve tried CBD oil yet. I’ve been ill for almost 30 years and am vocal about it. I throw it up there with unsolicited advice.
3963 2018-10-17 17:56:04 People who still associate or reference current political ideologies with the political parties of the past have IQs similar to dried peanut oil
3964 2018-10-17 17:56:02 So, while the technological feat achieved by SOFIA of placing a telescope onto a commercial jet is itself a stunning accomplishment, the analysis of the produced imagery put forward seems to come from a pre-Space Age era when people still read by the light of whale oil lanterns.
3965 2018-10-17 17:55:57 Yes, especially because they use their own car, their own gas, and their own oil. Their tips count for all of those things they have to maintenance to  plus it’s just curtesy like I mean they’re bringing your food to you..

I ask that we urgently show the same humanity & end these "wars" which is a war of terror from us inflicted upon Muslims in lands of oil.
3970 2018-10-17 17:55:18 The Saudis did horrible things before Trump. Before Obama. Before Bush. Before Clinton. Let's stop this game of blaming Trump. The reasons we've had an intimate relationship with the Saudis are their oil, location, power & influence, and esp. their "friendship" with US leaders.
3971 2018-10-17 17:55:16 We stood behind KSA because of their oil and because of Iran, but you're right, this is a different level of moral depravity. MBS is brazen flaunting his ability to do whatever he wants, sans repercussions.
3972 2018-10-17 17:55:13 @BarackObama Who read my writing the Whitehouse took you to Panama City on the other side of the gulf from where it was on Fire in Texas right before the oil hit there so you ignoranty said on tv looking the fool no damage to the gulf
3973 2018-10-17 17:55:03 Who's buying the oil? Which companies are drilling? Where are the stolen dollars hidden/"invested"? Where do they go for holidays,treatment,school? The west. The developed democratic west is complicit of the atrocities & poverty in Africa.
3974 2018-10-17 17:55:01 How could you forget the oil top up’s as well.... 
3975 2018-10-17 17:54:52 I guess military effort in the middle East region has a cost, after oil inflation created by the cancellation of the Iranian deal, the highest deficit since the 2008 recession engendered by the Middle East campaign, all of it advised and monitored by Benjamin Netanyahu.
3976 2018-10-17 17:54:49 When oil/gas workers suffer, it's a fucking provincial tragedy. When they are doing well, and other's suffer, NBGAF. I mean, the shit-fit over the minimum wage increase is proof of that.
3977 2018-10-17 17:54:49 All... worse than snake oil.
3978 2018-10-17 17:54:47 A swap of real assets like gold vs oil is not an arb. Same way that supply of oil swapped for products is not a sale. An arb requires a unit of account.

3984 2018-10-17 17:54:30 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate #Vote Red for Ted..
3985 2018-10-17 17:54:29 It is and it's also the great failure of Texas. They are incredibly dependent on oil, and refuse to diversify their economy. So when the tap runs out, they're going to be left flat-footed.
3986 2018-10-17 17:54:15 Do you understand the meaning of artificial shortages? Check one of cooking oil companies ceo @Busisa74  timeline
3987 2018-10-17 17:54:04 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
3988 2018-10-17 17:54:01 @Oil_Guns_Merica we have to be better people. It’s current year.  Beep boop beep
3989 2018-10-17 17:53:52 So Lucio and Maicon were the best defenders in that period? Lol
Zanetti to me was like Milner now, a utility player that was in form. You can't say these three players would have been the first choice of managers in their various positions at the time
3990 2018-10-17 17:53:51 I remember hearting oil.
3991 2018-10-17 17:53:50 The kickback reaction or the lack thereof, of the moment you put the potatoes in the blazing hot oil to make fries, it's all that's needed to measure one's masculinity
3992 2018-10-17 17:53:35 Literally the worst ever at his Job- move along Senate business. Just Obstruct, and have no ideas and nothing to say, just monopolist protection of oil and gas and anyone paying.
3993 2018-10-17 17:53:31 People beat up on Musk but are quiet when the lying sharks in the polluting oil industry look for every opportunity to bring down his company.  It’s about time people gave Musk credit and stop bitching.
3994 2018-10-17 17:53:26 Couscous, red onion, red pepper, olive oil, red chilli, balsamic vinegar, feta. White wine.
3995 2018-10-17 17:53:26 Спящий череп.

Не трогайте меня, я сплю.
3996 2018-10-17 17:53:25 #legalizationday problem is that now they will close the medical stores and maybe the pot is gonna be more expensive and the eatables are gonne and now i need cbd oil for anxiety lol
3997 2018-10-17 17:53:20 Obviously they have never been partners in anything, just to begin with. Their only interest is in inciting "lets you and him fight" with Iran. They have never provided any benefit whatsoever apart from the oil they would sell anyway if we had no relations with them at all.
3998 2018-10-17 17:53:20 That saw dusty stuff they put on the puke to absorb it like oil dry....always seemed to happen in school...lol
3999 2018-10-17 17:53:10 Because. You’re talking the necessary starch you need from the pasta away from it, adding oil so the sauce won’t stick to it - and then making the whole dish oil based. If your pasta is sticking together it’s means you don’t have enough water, and you’re not stirring it
4000 2018-10-17 17:53:07 Namibia have enough cooking oil and sugar.
4001 2018-10-17 17:53:06 ไอโก๊ะเอ๊ยยยย กวนสุดดด
4002 2018-10-17 17:53:05 It’s a little pricy but tarte maracuja oil is heaven sent!!! Seriously better than any moisturizer I’ve ever used, I would put it on at night and as needed during the day
4003 2018-10-17 17:53:04 The 3 anti fracking protesters have been released from Preston prison. 
Now there is just the matter of the original judge who gave the men their 16 mouths sentences. 
And his links to the oil & gas industry. 
More corruption, with a Tory government.
4004 2018-10-17 17:53:03 Oil fields may be it for me, my taste too expensive for this bullshit
4005 2018-10-17 17:53:02 ive deep conditioning my hair, oil treatments etc like wtf
4006 2018-10-17 17:52:53 Aye where do they do synthetic oil changes for less than 60? Walmart out of pocket
4007 2018-10-17 17:52:52 Better yet would've been not allowing the travesty of Bush v Gore to put us further down the road of Arab oil dependence 18 years ago.
4008 2018-10-17 17:52:41 No coincidence that at same time dollar went off gold standard, oil started trading in dollars only!
4009 2018-10-17 17:52:38 Word... Either use fluoride free toothpaste or coconut oil and baking soda w/ essential oils.

To whiten teeth very very effectively and quickly, use coconut oil and activated charcoal.

Collect spring #water and/or find a good filter and/or try AdyaClarity by @WaterLibertyRC
4010 2018-10-17 17:52:31 Give away free oil? Spend billions on weapons sales? Quicken the pace of opening up their economy to Western firms? Remove bin Salman via a coup a stick one of the million & one other princes in his place?
4011 2018-10-17 17:52:24 I am taking a course on CBD oil and it's health benefits. I have to say, I am LOVING it.  It impacts and improves so many things.  #healyourself #stress #hormones #ansiety #goodsexlife
4012 2018-10-17 17:52:24 My car really is the dirtiest, @ the men who have to drive her to get my oil changed, I’m so sorry, but I hope u at least enjoy my air freshener
4013 2018-10-17 17:52:20 That is why I wasn't sure if I would still need conditioner or not? I do like my laundry to have a nice smell.
I have seen someone make conditioner with white vinegar and bergamott essential oil. But I would worry the vinegar would eventually ruin the clothes.
4014 2018-10-17 17:52:13 We can't condemn #SaudiArabia because of oil. We give our sons & daughters lives & limbs for the oil. We sacrificed over 3,000 Americans on 9/11 for the Saudis.  And our Früher is worried about the economy if we cut down using fossil fuels?
4015 2018-10-17 17:52:11 Like McDavid I think you are stupid to not look at it. I don't know much but it sounds like CBD oil is where it is at? Doubt many athletes would want to smoke?
4016 2018-10-17 17:51:48 Yes. Or some oil money tycoon.
4017 2018-10-17 17:51:45 yes because of oil oil oil. With the Iran sanctions coming we need their oil. We import 40% of oil every single day. Do Americans really want to pay $10/gallon? We could go alternative and increase ethanol production.
4018 2018-10-17 17:51:42 Everywhere oil and flour
4019 2018-10-17 17:51:30 These women probably found an opportunity to make money to feed their families. They buy the oil where it is readily available, then travel to crisis areas and sell. I doubt they would charge exorbitant prices
4020 2018-10-17 17:51:14 Do you think the UK has the same oil reserves as Venezuela? The same tariffs? Do you think it's on the same part if the planet?
4021 2018-10-17 17:51:09 Psalm - 23.5: You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. - Bible Offline
@dezypaul4
4022 2018-10-17 17:51:09 Do you know how much per barrel was crude oil back then? This same man generated more revenues for the country there by increasing our reserves than PDP as done in the last 16yrs? This same regimes budget for 2017 wasn't passed by the NASS until November last year?
4023 2018-10-17 17:51:09 my sister just accidentally drank bath oil ksnhdjdjdksk i PHYSICALLY CANT
4024 2018-10-17 17:50:53 Fracking has been happening on & offshore UK for decades in the oil industry - it is well regulated by the OGA, HSE etc (there are many boring videos online detailing what they regulate!)... BUT we should still be pushing towards a renewables future, without question! (2/2)
4025 2018-10-17 17:50:45 Cruz made it sound like, when the world is in ruins, it will be Texas’ fault. He kept hammering on how vital oil is for Texas.
4026 2018-10-17 17:50:41 Wanna make instantly addictive pasta? A little butter or olive oil & cheese the noodles b4 you put on the sauce you like. Fresh parmy of course.Your guests won’t know what hit them. All they’ll know is that they want more.  Careful, they may slur their words. #NationalPastaDay
4027 2018-10-17 17:50:40 We realized how intertwined petrol and the economy are. We also realized how global warming will take down everything and I think you can't see that. Venezuela can't use its oil reserves now because of social collapse. That will be global.
4028 2018-10-17 17:50:38 Who posted that white people snapped with olive oil? bc they were right
4029 2018-10-17 17:50:31 The Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s shocked Americans by revealing an unprecedented level of greed and corruption within the federal government. The scandal involved ornery oil tycoons, poker-playing politicians, illegal liquor sales, a murder-suicide, a womanizing President
4030 2018-10-17 17:50:26 $CPG Well don @Geggs1 We're bumping along the bottom here. WTI is still $70+ but the overwhelming distaste for oil stocks continues
4031 2018-10-17 17:50:20 He’s a proud seller of Snake oil! And he’s only as good as the pass he gets on a regular basis!

4034 2018-10-17 17:50:06 Well the Trump WH and GOP have walked straight into this ambush: “the US has been depending on Riyadh's support in keeping oil prices low when new sanctions against its regional rival, Iran, kick in next month.” Hayes Brown

Power becomes impotent when it’s wielded by fools.
4035 2018-10-17 17:49:56 Maybe we should just burn all the coal and oil as fast as possible and just get it over with.
4036 2018-10-17 17:49:53 I see a whole new concept for strip clubs. How about a laptop dance? That'll be $20 to oil my gaskets, baby.
4037 2018-10-17 17:49:49 With all the blood-I mean oil money that the company has received from the Saudi deals, why hasn’t WWE brought back the pyro?
4038 2018-10-17 17:49:47 What a super duper day in ontario, weed is legal bitchesssss #legalizationday
4039 2018-10-17 17:49:46 Noob question. 

What does curry taste like?!  I found a recipe for crockpot chicken curry but I’ve never had curry. Plus, the recipe calls for coconut milk and I don’t like the taste of coconut. Does it taste like that or is it like coconut oil where it doesn’t have a flavor?
4040 2018-10-17 17:49:33 Only if the oil money deal doesn’t materialise

4048 2018-10-17 17:49:01 Yes, and this is why the US and the world should have gotten serious about curbing the oil addiction and consumption problem decades ago. Instead the US invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. #Senseless
4049 2018-10-17 17:49:00 おまヒクやめろ
4050 2018-10-17 17:48:51 Then the oil or edible route is the way to go man.

4056 2018-10-17 17:48:34 Wow, there has been a lot of ads saying no, I'm guessing the oil industry is paying you all well.  Remember Vote yes if you want a carbon tax (a good idea).  Vote no if you are a Trumer or work for the oil/gas industry.  That's pretty much your choice at the moment.
4057 2018-10-17 17:48:27 AHH! The old oil burners, what a lovely sound, although being ready to snatch the clutch in when they seize at high speed keeps you on your toes!
4058 2018-10-17 17:48:25 He that eats a new yam with old palm oil will never know what it means to stand at STC bus stop in the rain.
4059 2018-10-17 17:48:21 When you rub too much coconut oil on so you ring your skin out into the breakfast frying pan

4061 2018-10-17 17:48:20 Sadly, he won’t get one for this even though I think these days you can get a Nobel Prize when you get an oil change.
4062 2018-10-17 17:48:11 We are not beholden to the Saudis for oil. They know where the bodies are buried. We have shared secrets. 

It's a deal with the Devil the compromises any leverage we should have.
4063 2018-10-17 17:48:10 How about oil company subsidies??? I think they are doing good enough but Republicans wont cut them #facts #matter #Shameful
4064 2018-10-17 17:48:08 CBD does come from hemp oil.
4065 2018-10-17 17:48:03 I’m going on the 40th minute of this oil change. I can’t. I’m about to walk home.
4066 2018-10-17 17:48:01 If it weren’t for this cbd oil I’d be having a fucking fit.
4067 2018-10-17 17:47:58 15 of the 19. We have sold our souls for oil and arms deals.
4068 2018-10-17 17:47:57 Reviewing the Mercedes workshop manual and it says Mercedes engines like the oil thick. 40 weight for hot environments. Even lists 50 and 60 weights as possible.
4069 2018-10-17 17:47:54 My lip looks so bad from that oil popping on me
4070 2018-10-17 17:47:53 We looked at the moisturizing properties of hempseed oil and found it was the perfect oil to add to our hand lotionHempseed oil is full of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and Vitamin E and makes our lotion deeply hydrating #Elevate
4071 2018-10-17 17:47:44 The original Judge had family connections in the oil industry..the connection was too convenient & yet another example of how the law is an ass. The Judge & his background should have been properly vetted before the trial.
4072 2018-10-17 17:47:25 You got that right Chuck! Bleeding heart Liberals with issues over a Non Citizen of USA getting whacked for bad mouthing his own folks. None of our business and keep sending us oil and thanks for arms deal!!
4073 2018-10-17 17:47:25 Terry am without a brain cos the same Saudi does business with British oil company if the issue of human right does not come up there it should not come up in the takeover of @ManUtd
4074 2018-10-17 17:47:14 Why does no one point out that parents are destroying the planet at a faster rate than anyone? Breeding is LITERALLY killing the planet! One cannot be an environmentalist if they have kids. Yet, no one wants to talk about scientific facts. Having children is like an oil spill.
4075 2018-10-17 17:47:13 therown_bin A suggestion would be, since Saudi Arabia is suffering a political relations nightmare on several fronts and since you're the lead strategist of OPEC? Why don't you lower the oil prices for the hard working people in this beautiful world. AFF By Elder Father...
4076 2018-10-17 17:47:12 Lol I didn't even know
Congrats man @my_khelz

4080 2018-10-17 17:47:03 幻葬機関作らせろ(過激派)
4081 2018-10-17 17:47:02 I'm trying to think up something to do with hydrocarbons and 'oil will be well' but it turns out you really cant mix oil and water.
4082 2018-10-17 17:46:59 We should all be able to stop importing oil from despotic reqimes  , replace that with renewables, there's a start
4083 2018-10-17 17:46:59 How will u know the Camry uses that oil.
4084 2018-10-17 17:46:59 Chelsea
Before the oil money.
4085 2018-10-17 17:46:58 No, he talks about $100 billion in purchases that have been discussed but not made! Oil prices are down and the Saudis do not have the resources to make the purchases!
4086 2018-10-17 17:46:49 Na wa o..the woman na oil well?
4087 2018-10-17 17:46:44 Lmaooo idiot
4088 2018-10-17 17:46:41 "sorta true"?
-Syria announced it'd abandon usd-denominated oil sales back in 2007. The USA would have destroyed the Assad regime, except for Russian intervention. Still, the USA is in Syria. How is Syria now?
4089 2018-10-17 17:46:40 tamarind olive oil and octopus bratwurst. . .7

4090 2018-10-17 17:46:36 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
4091 2018-10-17 17:46:30 They told us about Mega deals before elections. Boom, after elections no cooking oil, mazoe, sugar and fuel. Where are Mega Deals and billion FDIs? Now they are quiet !
4092 2018-10-17 17:46:30 I’ll find out what the CBD oil is called so you can go looking for it!
4093 2018-10-17 17:46:27 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
4094 2018-10-17 17:46:27 I wouldn't mind paying a reasonable price for it, especially if it falls far below the cost of fresh oil sold in stores and is still much cheaper than gas or diesel, and smells much better than methane (which anyone make and burn as needed).
4095 2018-10-17 17:46:23 Just palm oil
4096 2018-10-17 17:46:20 The quick answer is Chavez nationalization of all the oil companies didn't work out in the long run. A good question to ask Corbyn is if he thought it was a good idea at the time. (I already know the answer.)
4097 2018-10-17 17:46:16 Companies that produce oil produce all types of oils. No one produces oils just for motorcycle.
4098 2018-10-17 17:46:10 Its all about two things !!!!   OIL and MONEY !!!!!
4099 2018-10-17 17:46:10 This is a true definition of the topic Variable separable in Differential Equation. Let the waters, maggi, salt and red oil then separate from the leaves and the egunsi. Lol
4100 2018-10-17 17:46:09 あの頃の創作再構築するか〜？？

4103 2018-10-17 17:45:46 Cmon Mike .. with all due respect.. write the pc that says ..imposing our “supposed values”on 3rd world minded govts is a losing game leads to wars and high oil prices and Trump has done more in 2 yrs for Mid East peace than prior 3 administrations
4104 2018-10-17 17:45:46 Blend 3 cups Cabbage with 2 1/2 pints eggrolls. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve warm.
4105 2018-10-17 17:45:42 Nope! They are here until we’ve developed something comparable, and we aren’t there yet. We’ll always be using oil and gas . There are many products besides fuel-plastics, nylon, man-made rubber, etc.
4106 2018-10-17 17:45:39 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
4107 2018-10-17 17:45:30 #MAGA I suppose your approval of oil drilling doesn't contribute now does it!! Lestist Scams are pathetic!
4108 2018-10-17 17:45:27 We need to advance green energy.  We can’t wait till we run out of oil to advance non fossil fuel solutions. Beto is looking toward the future and the welfare of all Texans and Americans unlike you.
4109 2018-10-17 17:45:22 Bitchhhh I can’t wait to sit in some chamomile oil tonight 
4110 2018-10-17 17:45:16 coconut oil+castor oil+argan oil+almond oil+sesame oil= current hair treatment
4111 2018-10-17 17:45:16 Those two groups are like oil & water & have fought for thousands of yrs! The best hope is to maintain some sense if peace. They'll never get along!
4112 2018-10-17 17:45:15 Yessss 

U have to oil it after washing to avoid rusting. So much work
4113 2018-10-17 17:45:13 Me at the place I get my oil changes: new bench, nice
4114 2018-10-17 17:45:07 It is all over internet.. IPCC n algore's earlier claims have changed from global warming to climate change now.. the PhD guy is also sharing the math behind it..peer reviewing is as good as lobbying.. remember US  refuting salt in toothpaste earlier n discardimg coconut oil
4115 2018-10-17 17:45:04 What about Grapeseed oil, does that fuck up test as well?
4116 2018-10-17 17:44:58 I thought I saw it on there earlier, I think they removed the oil & capsules that are sold out.
4117 2018-10-17 17:44:54 y'all NEVER check the oil  but god is good
4118 2018-10-17 17:44:50 Blame-the-victim taken to new depths, and here it seemed you couldn’t go lower! Whatabouting using the wars W started into the bargain! You •do• know Bush started them, right? 

And who is our largest supplier of oil? Canada. SA supplies a big 8%. Time to ditch’em. #GoSolar 
4119 2018-10-17 17:44:48 So Zimbabweans buy cooking oil as they see it? The selfishness of wanting all the cooking for oneself and disregarding the others in the community is witchcraft. Abayeke ubuhwaba abantu labo ayi..mncim!!!
4120 2018-10-17 17:44:46 Blood for oil.  How very robber baronish of him...
4121 2018-10-17 17:44:44 Had my oil changed and the car checked in preparation for my NH vehicle inspection... Today my check engine light decided to show up 
4122 2018-10-17 17:44:33 I wasn't actually bitten . But one time i was out on a date and felt something tickle the top of my ear attempting to brush whatever it was  away . Long story short after 3 hours of panic and some cooking oil later huge white tail spider and no second date
4123 2018-10-17 17:44:16 And farmers can trust you? I got two words for you, sunflower oil.    #KempIsACheat #gapol
4124 2018-10-17 17:44:09 The only thing I don’t like about the cold is once you step outside.....it doesn’t matter if you bathe in coco butter, baby oil, and Vaseline SOMEHOW you’ll get ashy
4125 2018-10-17 17:44:09 Any journalist in a country run by dictators. It's an absolute horror what happened to Khashoggi. Some articles I've read said that he was chopped up alive. Oil > human rights apparently
4126 2018-10-17 17:44:07 Why is there an oil truck in the middle of a busy road... They're really trying to kill us
4127 2018-10-17 17:44:06 Props to @bigotires for fixing my flat quickly and efficiently. Fair prices. Great customer service. Y’all definitely just got a new client for in the future (for oil changes; hopefully no more flats)!
4128 2018-10-17 17:44:05 "sorta true"? 
-Saddam tried to sell Iraqi oil in currency other than usd. so USA invaded. How is Iraq now?
-Libya sought to create a gold backed currency for african development & independence from the usd. so the USA bombed. How is Libya now?
4129 2018-10-17 17:44:02 If only energy equities ever catch up to the price of oil.
Frustrating.

4133 2018-10-17 17:43:50 Finally checked out Prune... nice space, friendly service + some good food: Fresh Oysters, Rabbit, Trout + Duck were very good. Brisket was 50% fat. Butterscotch pudding was bland, Calvados Omelette was basically a fried egg... Toast w/ Chocolate + Olive Oil was comical.

4136 2018-10-17 17:43:32 TWO BIG Macros for INDIA  - OIL & Bond Rates.

Brent seems to be settling in $75 - $85 with bias on lower side. Should give some respite to NIFTY. (10000)

US Bond Rates - Will keep heading to 4% mark in the nxt 3Q. That's a serious headwind for INDIA. Nifty 8500 - 9000.

4145 2018-10-17 17:43:03 So our values now include the death and dismemberment of innocent journalists as long as there are oil and weapons deals to make. America under Trump.

4150 2018-10-17 17:42:39 Just make sure you don't affect our economy with regard to sales for our companies or oil reprisals from our actions.
4151 2018-10-17 17:42:36 I agree we only have one shot and with that massive fossil fuel expansion in fracking and the oil sands is an absurd strategy that doesn't do anything good for the environment. A 40 Billion investment in LNG gets us 10,000 jobs? I cant think of a more pathetic ROI #nonsense
4152 2018-10-17 17:42:18 There has been oil drilling and coal mining on reservations throughout the country for over 60 years. Trump is not responsible for anything there!
4153 2018-10-17 17:42:17 Stop getting perms, I stopped using shampoo and only co-wash my hair, I  use oil not grease and that's about it. I don't have any specific products I use my hair naturally just went like that. I don't have an exact regimen

4155 2018-10-17 17:42:13 I asked you to explain, not to spew riddles.  We owe the debt to a variety of establishments.  1/3 of UK government debt is privately owned, by software companies and middle-eastern oil people, mostly outside the EU.
4156 2018-10-17 17:42:13 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
4157 2018-10-17 17:42:11 Wow, sounds like how a Tory would get their ears done  My doctor told me to throw olive oil down my ear for a week until I got it syringed. I smelt like cooking oil for a whole week. It was lovely.

Some said the boys played well because they were promised cooking oil. Well we heard the "jokes" and we've responded. Yesterday was something special as we presented the team with cooking oil, caps and t shirts for making us proud....ZIMGOLD
4163 2018-10-17 17:41:24 Yep and do an oil change
4164 2018-10-17 17:41:16 Jamaican black castor oil on your roots >>>>
4165 2018-10-17 17:41:07 Mechanic says “don’t be late on the oil change, it’ll ruin your car” me: “ I’m poor so if you wanna pay for it next time, I’ll be here on time”......she just smiled and said okay. 
4166 2018-10-17 17:41:04 JFC I think I’ve written about SCADA and electronic gas measurement systems in the Oil & Gas industry enough for today.
4167 2018-10-17 17:41:03 Also... deep frying Capers in Olive oil is so yum!
4168 2018-10-17 17:41:00 (typos) "But it seems pretty clear KSA has used one of its consulates as a human butchery. Who should be expelled?"

We should go further: close their embassies/butcheries.
A start to a wider BDS of Saudi, like banning imports of its oil, or at least taxing the hell out of them
4169 2018-10-17 17:40:55 We can't dominate the world's sale of oil with just our own and zero military overreach.
4170 2018-10-17 17:40:43 @UpstreamDataInc seems 2b doing this"Today marks about 1 full year of Bitcoin mining for our prototype HashGen skid off of stranded natural gas.We estimate it has consumed 150k cubic meters of natural gas&reduced the CO2e footprint of our upstream oil&gas clients by 6,750 tonnes
4171 2018-10-17 17:40:40 My mom switched to coconut oil for makeup remover and it legit caused her vision problems D:
4172 2018-10-17 17:40:34 do you use a spoon to whisk the boiling oil on top of the egg 
4173 2018-10-17 17:40:32 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
4174 2018-10-17 17:40:22 They have the oil !
4175 2018-10-17 17:40:21 If it’s pure tea tree oil you have to dilute it because it can burn you can mix it with coconut oil. That’s what I do. I have a little tube with a roller at the end & I just apply it at night if I need to
4176 2018-10-17 17:40:17 I refuse to partake in low seat debates about cooking oil & sugar. This hullabaloo screams of leadership failure & an urgent need to address that. We can't be celebrating the availability such basics in this day neither should we waste time on jerry (JORAM) cans.
4177 2018-10-17 17:40:13 THIS IS FALSE AND IRRESPONSIBLE AND LIBELOUS. We also buy oil from them, and they have our national nuts in a vice grip for a dozen other reasons. Yeah, this will end exactly how we think it will.

4179 2018-10-17 17:40:08 It is open. 

One side is Margarita style (no sauce, olive oil, tomatoes, basil and mozzarella) and the other side is fresh tomatoes and garlic with olive oil style as well. 

So damn good.
4180 2018-10-17 17:40:06 Whats this cooking oil craze about kodwa? Someone tell me.
4181 2018-10-17 17:39:57 Guess most men fall into two categories. The majority would eat almost anything as long as salt, pepper etc are okay. There are a few who know what they want including the ratio of egusi to palm oil in the egusi soup. You don't want the later.
4182 2018-10-17 17:39:38 lawyering on behalf of oil companies who "accidentally" dump 400 gallons of oil into womens basements is a pretty bad look either way

not sure i could vote for someone lacking such a basic sense of right and wrong
4183 2018-10-17 17:39:29 It's all good until Big Oil comes and tells you THEY now own YOUR property. There is a reason we have laws. Mostly to prevent people like the Dotard from trampling our rights. Beware.
4184 2018-10-17 17:39:29 looks like its a good time to invest in saudi oil yall
4185 2018-10-17 17:39:28 Warren next will push her snake oil

Go away
4189 2018-10-17 17:39:15 That the one where the judge had dodgy ties to oil companies?
4190 2018-10-17 17:39:12 Don't be a pushover for the Saudis.  It's way beneath the dignity of the American Pres. The kingdom is a small desert autocracy that the Allies enabled to be constructed after victory over the Ottoman Empire in WW1.  The Saudis' weaponization of oil must never be tolerated again!
4191 2018-10-17 17:39:03 Oil prices slump after large build in U.S. stockpiles: Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures dipping below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S. stockpiles rose by 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped.
4192 2018-10-17 17:39:03 What a helpful bunch, good work  You will be oil making experts by the end 
4193 2018-10-17 17:38:52 Since we are the largest producer of oil “in the world” how about we knock these GAS prices down a bit. Help out the average citizen a bit.

4195 2018-10-17 17:38:40 I don't think Pompeo's gone out there to find out what's going on. I think he's gone to find out what's going on and how he, MBS can convince Erdogan to spin it away from state murder, or.. increased oil prices.. Of course, USA will have to pay off Erdogan for his silence..
4196 2018-10-17 17:38:37 Zim national team players paid with boxes of cooking oil. On the other hand they are hiring a private plane for someone to come home. When will Zimbabwe value what raises the nation flag higher??

4197 2018-10-17 17:38:27 I finally got around to trying the jook (a.k.a. congee/kayu/etc.; rice porridge) they have at work and now I want to have it every time I come in. It goes amazingly well with some soy sauce and chili oil.
4198 2018-10-17 17:38:26 Move too Columbus OH we pay 2.45 here right now sometimes less.......we only have 1 tax unlike greedy ass PA where they have 2 taxes on gas n oil and they been contemplating a 3rd tax smh
4199 2018-10-17 17:38:21 Sure. Except “essential oils” and their ilk DON’T work. They’re complete and utter bullshit. And the fact that kids are forced to suffer because their parents are ignorant assholes that trust snake oil peddlers instead of basic science is both “ugly” and infuriating.
4200 2018-10-17 17:38:16 Trump tiny weenie shouldn't talk Trump's oil and got a three and a half inch hard on that he hasn't seen in 15 years!!!!
4201 2018-10-17 17:37:58 Your WCW can't do an oil change.
4202 2018-10-17 17:37:47 Tic toc tic toc,is oil about to drop?
4203 2018-10-17 17:37:43 Meh! Wait until the price of oil start to go UP See how fast this will be "swept under the rug"
4204 2018-10-17 17:37:42 And I like the fact you called them "good players" 
They weren't the best in their individual positions at that time.
4205 2018-10-17 17:37:36 With oil as (virtually) our only available source of transportation fuel, what choice to we have at the moment? Now's the time to invest in production of American-made alternative fuels. Yep, boring old #ethanol solves a lot of problems. Including the most important ones.
4206 2018-10-17 17:37:35 The only meaningful boycott is to stop buying their oil. Ready, set...

His couldn't even stand up for his wife who fake POTUS denigrated.
4213 2018-10-17 17:37:00 DA; is excellent point. Mother Russia nyet want to have to become "swing oil producer" because Saudi shitshow blows oil gook all over Middle East and beyond. Mother Russia just want chaos HERE, because WE put pressure on IT; it nyet want whole world to go to shit at once.

4217 2018-10-17 17:36:53 I understand that Latin Americans have not started any revolutions because they have been robbed of land, gold, or oil. It was because they started taking their women, I.e. dancing partners? Lesson in there...
4218 2018-10-17 17:36:47 Supposedly we don't need them... Supposedly we have the largest oil reserves in the world... Drill baby drill.
4219 2018-10-17 17:36:47 Despite all their oil money, the Saudis haven't evolved much from fundamentalist camel jockeys.
4220 2018-10-17 17:36:38 All of this when we could just get oil from our own continent?
4221 2018-10-17 17:36:34 You what you think? When US just oil is important. Saudi anything you, but America support is. The conscience world is sleeping?
4222 2018-10-17 17:36:34 I don't think that this phenomenon is limited to Trump.  We've always been nice to the Saudis because of the interests of US Oil companies in the region.  This is why we need energy independence through alternative sources of energy.
4223 2018-10-17 17:36:32 Cheers Nick, must include help from Festool too. They were in a state, previous dec rad rolled oil eggshell no laying off etc. Should have taken a b4 too

4227 2018-10-17 17:36:12 We now have CBD Oil!! Available to ANYONE! Call for more information!
4228 2018-10-17 17:36:11 Yes! Democrats campaigning but not on climate change. Say they'll work for incremental changes if they get the House. Remember Dems in Senate crushed cap & trade. I'm sure oil corp read them the riot act. So forget anything being done about climate change.

4230 2018-10-17 17:36:02 So what you’re saying is, we spend trillions of dollars starting a war halfway across the world so we can harvest oil and then we just leave it there once we’ve toppled the government and pull out.
4231 2018-10-17 17:36:00 I burnt my potatoes bc i didnt put enough oil in the pan BUT YOU KNOW WHAT this is fine
4232 2018-10-17 17:35:57 Hope you are right about your blue arrow for xle but worried oil falls to 64 as Elliott wave folks seem to be predicting.

4238 2018-10-17 17:35:47 It's a good idea to remember re: Cuba's environmentalist policies that it's also still doing exploratory drilling off of its Northern Coast and if it hits the big time re: oil deposits, you'd best believe they're not leaving it in the ground.

4249 2018-10-17 17:34:42 There was a small oil or gas company (I think) that was getting shamed for not using HTTPS on login, then infosec twitter pentested them. I think they found other super outdated systems in their network? I could have sworn it was troy hunt or scott helme but search comes up empty
4250 2018-10-17 17:34:34 Totally agree! We can not afford bad blood between us, as None of our business what happened to Non US Citizen known to be friend of Bin Laden and trash talk journalist. We need arms deal for jobs and the oil.
4251 2018-10-17 17:34:32 Look, my gas is already $3.43/gallon. Fuck the Saudis. There are lots of other countries that have oil. We should have cut them off decades ago.
4252 2018-10-17 17:34:30 America attacked Afghanistan and Iran for oil business not for terrorism!!! American politicians play very dirty politics!!!
4253 2018-10-17 17:34:26 President Trump will destroy the environment via corrupt EPA give it to the Oil, Gas, Coal company To destroy the  children & grandchildren future.
4254 2018-10-17 17:34:14 throw in a couple of bottles of baby oil and it gets fun :)
4255 2018-10-17 17:34:06 I haven’t tried CBD oil, but one of the recommended high-CBD strains gave me negative side effects the few times I tried it. I was unbelievably angry, and then I would crash into depression.
4256 2018-10-17 17:34:03 I have a wonderful microwave popper that uses oil and makes terrific popcorn in three minutes.
4257 2018-10-17 17:34:01 The thing is I've no doubt they'll catch and make a big fuss over the tincture/oil. Either to get me to bribe my way out or to get it in the media. The customs are extremely corrupt.

4261 2018-10-17 17:33:45 Saudi Barbaria. If it weren’t for oil, these guys would still be in the Bronze Age
4262 2018-10-17 17:33:45 Check out the new McMansion: 3 story shotgun styles built on 0.05 acres and hideous exteriors?
4263 2018-10-17 17:33:43 Read the article. They are talking about pollution from gas and oil wells.
4264 2018-10-17 17:33:40 did ya ever say something  like  this !!!
trump has saudi by the balls,trump can come out supporting the killer prince,if saudi buys all $110 B in weapons as setup previously & keeping the price of oil low by saudi pumping more oil 

think about  how cheap life and principles are
4265 2018-10-17 17:33:39 Literally: to sell oil
4266 2018-10-17 17:33:38 They were good players , compare them to what the brilliant Mourinho has now at manUtd. Abi he is no more brilliant?
4267 2018-10-17 17:33:32 Tea Tree is a wonderful oil to always have on hand! We are happy you are enjoying the incredible benefits from this one!
4268 2018-10-17 17:33:27 Is that Saudi blood money Mike? Some more oil money to spread around that region. So profitable and Godly.

You are a stain on Christianity.

4273 2018-10-17 17:33:06 An adage says the load Klegged person carry is bent, they are only looking up and not down. It thus means that "Klegged" condition caused the load to bend. That 'oil' office has been cesspool of corruption .

4275 2018-10-17 17:32:56 It’s always a double header when Tito is on the card.
4276 2018-10-17 17:32:52 I say control what happens in your own country and let those countries kill each other. But its a fantasy. All is simply according to oil and power that's it so no point even discussing other options.

4278 2018-10-17 17:32:48 Ya, all riding on Matthew's coattails...just like Oil and McDavid.  Forget about RNH's 3 pts and Nurse's OT winner...still McD had an influence somehow....telepathy??
4279 2018-10-17 17:32:47 Pink n pay Harare street varikuti buy goods worth $10 for you to get 1 2l cooking oil
4280 2018-10-17 17:32:45 Never tried drugs in my life, but I’m 100% trying CBD oil. Heard amazing things about it.
4281 2018-10-17 17:32:43 that one oil, the one that starts with an M is realllllly good! Tarte has one and I love it!
4282 2018-10-17 17:32:42 Saudi reforms are clearly total bull shit. MBS should stand for major bull shit. His actions demonstrate they are simply doing a PR exercise to generate new revenue streams other than oil. No real change in approach from repression and murder on every scale.

4284 2018-10-17 17:32:34 I feel as though it would be easier to get oil off my skin than it is to get this face scrub. Perhaps im applying it a little too generously
4285 2018-10-17 17:32:33 Update on the CBD oil I bought...serving size is one drop and I realized today one drop is not one full dropper like I’ve been using 
4286 2018-10-17 17:32:32 Actually religion is fake and I find it sad anyone would be willing to kill or die for any invisible friend or just because someone looks different. and I don't have a bias, Syria can keep it's oil, it needs to lose Assad Iran and Russia. I like Trumps idea to just withold US $
4287 2018-10-17 17:32:30  a lil tip: try to use fresh herbs when possible, but good quality dried herbs are just as effective! 
 there are some instances that using dry herbs are preferable, like when making salves & oils, because the water content in fresh plants can spoil the oil 
4288 2018-10-17 17:32:09 donaldknerr 1: Thanks for asking, Donald! All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight.
4289 2018-10-17 17:32:05 An aging team. It was Mourinho's brilliance back then that helped their lives
4290 2018-10-17 17:32:03 This might in part be down to your being an honest man and not a snake oil salesman.
4291 2018-10-17 17:32:02 They want Trump to be the 1st POTUS ever to say "Gosh the saudis are horrible, i guess we can just live in a world without their oil. should be fine."
4292 2018-10-17 17:32:02 Neem oil or avocado/olive oil mixed with Oil of Oregano will take care of all that.
4293 2018-10-17 17:31:50 Pretty straightforward from here:
-Bolsonaro wins in Brazil
-Declares military dictatorship
-Takes over Venezuela
-Cuts a deal with his new friend Trump for the oil
4294 2018-10-17 17:31:49 Couldn’t fund itself !!?? With renewables, amazing food and drink products, skilled workforce, not to mention oil. Importantly free from the shackles of WM which has plundered Scotland’s wealth for 300+ years. Where has this amazing “union” got us?
4295 2018-10-17 17:31:33 I'm sure the thousands of orphan and abandoned oil and gas wells will have a greater impact.
4296 2018-10-17 17:31:20 I bet the Falcon smells like metal and oil.
4297 2018-10-17 17:31:19 From imminent nuclear war on... Can't remember a time in my life where I wasn't being told we were all doomed if we didn't start doing things different.

When I was in grade school in the 70's we were told we would use up the world's oil supply by the year 2000.
4298 2018-10-17 17:31:11 It is hydrogenated vegetable ( seed ) oil.
Deadlier .
4299 2018-10-17 17:30:55 Do we? And is it as good as Jamaican Castor oil ?
4300 2018-10-17 17:30:55 confusing thread ~ china's increased Saudi oil profile => Saudi stands against Iran => US supports Saudi => Saudi patrons Pak => US demands India to roll back its Iran Oil profile => (+) @ambkcsingh @kakar_harsha @Chopsyturvey @rwac48 @Chohan1954 @rssurjewala @pradyutbordoloi
4301 2018-10-17 17:30:35 The value of the alliance is an old fantasy. It's actually been harmful to the U.S. & our Western allies, esp. when the Saudis economically weaponized their oil to harm the West. The real question is why the West has tolerated this from a small desert kingdom set up after WW1?

4305 2018-10-17 17:30:21 OK, Benz is rebuilt with only a couple of missing or damaged fasteners left to go. Ordering an engine oil dipstick since the car doesn't come with one and is now a shop tool.

A/C blows cold. Needs another bath.
4306 2018-10-17 17:30:18 Sure, as long as Joe for Oil, stopped using them....
4307 2018-10-17 17:30:16 It's understandable why he's a rich successful businessman, but he's also a pure cunt. The people of Newcastle deserve a club that are aiming for the top 4. Surely some bored rich Arab can come and spend some of Daddies oil money.
4308 2018-10-17 17:30:15 Buy Ugandan, build Ugandan.. Don’t we have Ugandan Castor Oil???
4309 2018-10-17 17:30:12 @TeamCavuto Thought we were now oil efficient. Not so?

4313 2018-10-17 17:29:48 Watching @CiaoSamin on Salt Fat Acid Heat and my gawd I’ve never wanted to be drenched in olive oil so much in my life. DAMN THAT PESTO.
4314 2018-10-17 17:29:48 Saudi Arabia. What to do? You should be punished. But we like oil. nvm
#nospanking #oil
4315 2018-10-17 17:29:43 Trump talks big then changes his tune, he’s the head of another mob that in cahoots over the oil, he can’t risk the relationship so he wants it swept under the carpet. Who knows he may order black ops to knock the Prince off and support one of his cousins if he’s too difficult
4316 2018-10-17 17:29:36 He can't be gay and conservative! Lol. Madness out there.
4317 2018-10-17 17:29:33 They control the oil. They can do what they please.
4318 2018-10-17 17:29:33 I like the idea of kindly taking the discharged used oil off the restaurant owner's hands as a favor so he/she/they need not pay someone that will resell it anyway. ;)
4319 2018-10-17 17:29:28 When you’re ingesting it you definitely need to keep an eye on strength and strain. My partner is using cbd oil and she’s really benefiting from it
4320 2018-10-17 17:29:25 Drink some Castro oil and walk.
4321 2018-10-17 17:29:24 PSA for vegans: Plastic is manufactured with crude oil as an ingredient. Crude oil comes from dinosaurs that the oil industry slaughtered.

Please do not use any plastic products to show your support.

4324 2018-10-17 17:29:11 Yeah! because honestly Saudis don't keep their money in the hump of their camels, you can find it in the london and swiss banks. These govts make money off them too. It's business! did the west refuse aramco oil?

4327 2018-10-17 17:29:05 I use Cetaphil oil control moisturizer
4328 2018-10-17 17:29:03 It’s hard to run on green energy right away for a country the size of America. Plus oil is used to make almost every thing. Plastics have oil in them and are used in the machines that make it. I’m all for wind and solar power. But not all the country is sunny all the time nor is
4329 2018-10-17 17:28:59 Nah, the country needs the oil.  Solar panels can go elsewhere.
4330 2018-10-17 17:28:56 I could vivisect a journalist inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey and not lose any of my cash and oil thirsty global allies is the new I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any voters
4331 2018-10-17 17:28:47 Not a bad idea to privatise more but (a) Venezuelan regime does not produce reliable statistics and (b) the V. economy is now largely the state-owned oil sector,
4332 2018-10-17 17:28:40 @bobbybender3 do you mind following me? i got some cbd oil/concussion related questions to ask you via dm
4333 2018-10-17 17:28:31 idk if your doctor said but putting a drop or two of oil in your ear really helps
4334 2018-10-17 17:28:26 I have maj oregano burps from my oil of oregano & Thieves capsule but you better bet I’m not getting sick! #WorthIt
4335 2018-10-17 17:28:08 Ah yes, I agree but truffle oil is far more disgusting as it contains synthetic truffle essence & cheap olive oil. Truffle oil has zero actual truffles.
4336 2018-10-17 17:28:03 Aikaka, i thought vanhu varikungoda kutsvinya. So they were really promised cooking oil.
4337 2018-10-17 17:28:03 Its a 10 w keratin for shampoo & conditioner and deva curl & moroccan oil for styling are my go to’s. 100% pure organic beeswax for marions hair & the same shampoo & conditioner
4338 2018-10-17 17:27:55 Wondering if oil will head over around 64 now
4339 2018-10-17 17:27:54 Even why oil going up nothing in oil in otc either...
4340 2018-10-17 17:27:49 Chai, the way wey your head get fresh oil be like fresh palm wine, you too Sabi correct thing
4341 2018-10-17 17:27:49 No prayers. Use cannabis oil.
4342 2018-10-17 17:27:48 Oil brothers.
4343 2018-10-17 17:27:46 Shylas factory? Dia ngeluarin produk face oil juga
4344 2018-10-17 17:27:45 Rooibos tea is equivalent to coconut oil.
4345 2018-10-17 17:27:43 We don’t get that much oil from them, it’s all about us protecting them and then buying shit from us.
4346 2018-10-17 17:27:43 Where around Kampala can I get Jamaican Castor oil? #Help
4347 2018-10-17 17:27:42 Let’s not forget.....The 911 attacks were driven & executed by Saudi Arabians. They are not our friends & we do not need their oil. They may be a significant purchaser of American arms but who knows if they pay. Trump is lying about his links to Saudi Arabia.
4348 2018-10-17 17:27:38 ヤバくね？
4349 2018-10-17 17:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4350 2018-10-17 17:27:35 Yes Saudi Arabia is still the main swing producer in the world's crude oil market. This Khashoggi scandal is most likely an October Surprise attempt against President Trump who has so far dodged it very deftly. There's also the November 4th Iran sanctions restart date coming up.
4351 2018-10-17 17:27:30 Trump you can't be serious evidence is everywhere. Trump is the most inept leader ever. His administration are traitors to America. Enough trump we r not the lets make a deal nation. Saudi is quilty. No man, no country, no oil, no $ is above human rights.  boycott Saudi.
4352 2018-10-17 17:27:24 Oil and weapons deals are important. We know lives aren’t valued by the lack of control and promotion of arms selling within the US killing thousands  every year.
4353 2018-10-17 17:27:06 @AliVelshi Saudi journalist not important . Oil is
4354 2018-10-17 17:26:55 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

4356 2018-10-17 17:26:30 it will go  something  like  this !!!
trump has saudi by the balls,trump can come out supporting the killer prince,if saudi buys all $110 B in weapons as setup previously & keeping the price of oil low by saudi pumping more oil 

think about  how cheap life and principles are
4357 2018-10-17 17:26:24 But you voted against the violence against women act? You sir are the textbook definition of a snake oil salesman
4358 2018-10-17 17:26:24 Nukes aren’t perfect because of the wild fluctuations in demand which literally changes with the weather.  Oil fired peakers solve that by being cycled on and off with short notice.  We need a clean way to address high demand peaks.
4359 2018-10-17 17:26:23 Ok I did 1 out of the 3 things I was suppose to do today lol. Maybe I’ll get an oil change on Friday 
4360 2018-10-17 17:26:19 college has exposed me to many new people, i have now seen someone bring an entire carton of coconut water to class and someone carrying around a glass container of olive oil
4361 2018-10-17 17:26:04 tell me why i saw this n thought of the bp oil spill kkslshhslks
4362 2018-10-17 17:26:04 That Hot Baby Oil Bubble Bath Was Everything 
4363 2018-10-17 17:25:59 NNPC should consider those maintaining the crude oil pipeline from Warri to Kaduna & pay them.
4364 2018-10-17 17:25:58 We need better sponsorship. Cooking oil??? Poor motherland!
4365 2018-10-17 17:25:55 did ya ever say something  like  this !!!

4366 2018-10-17 17:25:52 It looks edible (but it's not)... ingredients include cocoa butter, Shea butter, olive oil, coconut oil, sweet almond oil,E Wax, beeswax coconut sugar, glycerin, cocoa butter FO, preservative at 1% ( phenoxy ethanol) and SCI noodles
4367 2018-10-17 17:25:50 Idc how independent I want to be I will always hate going to get my oil changed and wish my dad was here to do it for me.
4368 2018-10-17 17:25:48 No there not, still largest coal burning country, large oil consumer, stop drinking koolaid

4370 2018-10-17 17:25:41 @ChaelSonnen DM me playboy
4371 2018-10-17 17:25:41 You are making it easier for mercury to get in our air, coal ash in our water, and oil spills into our soil. You are helping big businesses exploit cheap labor and the investor class to reap huge windfalls at the expense of a stable economy for all.
4372 2018-10-17 17:25:38 21st century a country is celebrating the availability of cooking oil and sugar in supermarkets. This is the same country with leaders that project our country as middle income country by 2030. Stop these jokes Larry. This gutters !
4373 2018-10-17 17:25:33 Not celebrating but I’m going to look online to try some oil
4374 2018-10-17 17:25:25 Just bought a new wax burner and oil from home bargains and my house smells AMAZING!!!
4375 2018-10-17 17:25:15 Oil Tek...SA
4376 2018-10-17 17:25:03 I could make a sick joke about this/ but this is no laughing matter. And no we don’t need Saudi at all. When the oil dries up- so does their kingdom and they know it
4377 2018-10-17 17:25:00 So I service portable bathrooms for a living.  I've seen alot of stuff in 10+ years of doing this in the construction, oil/gas fields, and working in military bases over the years.  But this takes the weirdest thing found in a portapot..
4378 2018-10-17 17:24:52 LIES told to me when I was young:
1) Canada will never produce oil 
2) weed will never be legal 
3) When I grow up I’ll have boobs

COME TO ME BOOBIES!
4379 2018-10-17 17:24:47 Except, hockey is a diffferent sport. There are not many nights where one guy can be that much of a game changer. That’s why the Oil are still brutal. You can’t pay one guy twice as much. He never does twice as much.
4380 2018-10-17 17:24:43 My introduction to Wikipedia was helping my 3rd grader write a report on George Washington Carver. I quickly scrolled the page through the part about his penchant for massaging male students with peanut oil. I’m not sure that was appropriate or true for her report!
4381 2018-10-17 17:24:30 Can’t wait for the day the middle eastern oil runs out and places like Saudi Arabia and its obnoxious royals no longer have a hold and are put back to the Stone Age where they belong.
4382 2018-10-17 17:24:29 Learning time from oil experts #marutigenuineoil #hondagenuineoil doing inr. 250,000 cr turnover annually.. recognition for our efforts.. all worth the pain thru the year..
4383 2018-10-17 17:24:24 If cannabis was one of the main ingredients of the ancient anointing oil and receiving this oil is what made Jesus the Christ and his followers Christians, then persecuting those who use cannabis could be considered anti-Christ.
4384 2018-10-17 17:24:22 I love CBD oil. It is literally taking away all the pain in my wrist for my carpal tunnel.
4385 2018-10-17 17:24:16 Preheat your pans slowly before adding any oil or butter & they won't stick.
4386 2018-10-17 17:24:13 中小の倒産は大手がお金渋って中小が余計払えないってのはあると思う、というか税金も数年前よりも中小に不利になってた筈

本当に経営が上手くないと生き残れなくなってる、ブラック経営してる会社は潰れた方がいいけど
4387 2018-10-17 17:23:58 But see. The right, especially right politicians like to stroke fear, studies have shown that if you make conservstives feel safe, many of them lean away from the right. They love to scare their followers away from facts away from reason into their arms so they can sell snake oil

I’m on the keto diet.
4391 2018-10-17 17:23:40 Such joy to receive my car back after two months from Madrid only for it to be covered in thick black oil, broken key and a chip in the roof and alloy. Fabulous @TheRAC_UK ... the European policy I paid a fortune for was so worth it! NOT 
4392 2018-10-17 17:23:37 I second this endorsement of CBD. I'm normally adamantly against "holistic" medicine, or anything that doesn't have a strict scientific endorsement. But I tried CBD oil and it does wonders for my anxiety. It's like taking a chill pill. I sleep well on it and there is no "high".
4393 2018-10-17 17:23:24 Why do you people not fear to hoard so much oil?  

And risk being invaded by America 
4394 2018-10-17 17:23:21 Good we need to invade Saudi Arabia now and take their oil like we did Iraq
4395 2018-10-17 17:23:14 His preference for big oil dollars over lives became Crystal Clear after the School Bus bombing in Yemen.
4396 2018-10-17 17:22:57 I know they take resources from the coast like fish, minerals and oil. and I know they dump harmful chemicals into the sea but I dont think that in this video they are singing those songs... I seen this video b4 in YouTube.
4397 2018-10-17 17:22:54 Virgin coconut oil: oil made from a coconut that hasn’t been fucked yet or the oil from a coconut that hasn’t fucked yet?

4399 2018-10-17 17:22:45 So how much did the oil companies pay you to post this?

4404 2018-10-17 17:22:28 In the PNP Borrowdale queues were 'genuine shoppers' AND 'a cartel' of ladies that were recycling themselves. They were not buying oil for consumption but resale. They were very organized, would hold a place in turn at different cashiers. One was guarding the stash outside.

4406 2018-10-17 17:22:15 I went through his resume in 2014, and it was impossible to contact anyone who knew him.  As far as I could tell, he worked in the oil and gas industry, but no evidence of a leadership role.
4407 2018-10-17 17:22:15 I'd say climate change is starker. Cruz talking about how much transitioning off fossil fuels will cost oil companies to have a livable planet is pretty damn stark.
4408 2018-10-17 17:22:13 A protest by tens of thousands of people across Haiti turned violent Wednesday as anger grows over the alleged misuse of funds from an oil assistance program sponsored by Venezuela.
4409 2018-10-17 17:21:53 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

4411 2018-10-17 17:21:48 she just needs some coconut oil
4412 2018-10-17 17:21:48 we don't need Saudi oil, so who cares what they do
4413 2018-10-17 17:21:45 trump has saudi by the balls , trump can come out supporting the killer prince , if saudi buys all $110 B in weapons as setup previously and keeping the price of oil low by saudi increasing its imports 

think about  it
4414 2018-10-17 17:21:42 No point in getting mad , how about getting away from the Saudi swamp . All the jobs Trump is worried about could be replaced with wind and solar power initiative . Forget oil , forget the Saudis . If you have a chance see what Germany has done to get away from oil .
4415 2018-10-17 17:21:42 You were in 2014 when you said the oil would be gone in 5-10 years. But right when you said only an idiot would vote to leave the EU.
4416 2018-10-17 17:21:41 "It has the potential to really blow up, and to send prices to numbers that I didn't think we'd see again in our lifetime." - Oil industry analyst @TomKloza, on how #Saudi uncertainty could affect #oil and #gasoline prices. Hear my interview w/ Tom at 2:15pm ET on @wcbs880.
4417 2018-10-17 17:21:40 @Modiarmy Modi sir pls help us about oil and gas prices
4418 2018-10-17 17:21:39 Oil and gas are fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.  We are proud of this why?
4419 2018-10-17 17:21:39 They got some power to play around with charges why not use them to power batteries for a last decade or two, then war for oil, or katmandu humans illiciting sweat or cum wee.
4420 2018-10-17 17:21:36 They are making cars that we won't have an affordable fuel for in 50 years. Without huge advancements in algal oil production, combustion is going up in smoke

We are switching gas turbine to natural gas, auto can't make that switch. They need to go EV and or pump algae tech asap
4421 2018-10-17 17:21:29 People literally want the glazers dead but don’t want some Oil money Prince to take over 
4422 2018-10-17 17:21:28 The Virta Health program has at its foundation a single study with funding from Atkins Nutritionals, the National Dairy Council, and the Palm Oil Board.  There was no control group.  Baseline HgbA1C of 7.6 fell by 1% in those who completed the study, body weight fell on avg 7%.

4424 2018-10-17 17:21:08 They seem cheaper now, because we legit destroyed all our refineries. So many industries that rely on the by-products obtained from crude oil have all suffered  proportionally.

We sell crude and import DPK, AGO, PMS.

The 80/20 rule: Naija edition.

4425 2018-10-17 17:20:58 And he also committed treason with his coup De'etat against shagari! 2.8 billion Maura oil money missing! He is a thief
4426 2018-10-17 17:20:53 The real answer... Saudi Arabia controls about 20% of the worlds oil with the 2nd largest oil reserve on the planet. If you really want the answers to something....99 out of 100 questions have the same answer. M-O-N-E-Y
4427 2018-10-17 17:20:49 The House of Saud are tools, trained dogs the US/NATO regime uses to police the MENA and keep the oil flowing and the bombs falling

4429 2018-10-17 17:20:40 $LPI / Laredo about to take out all-time low stock price.  

If there is a worse collection of value destroying mgmt teams than in the e&p sector I’d live to know where.  

Oil high or oil low, many can’t add value and yet they get recycled through.
4430 2018-10-17 17:20:34 @ChaelSonnen I’m off today. Would be nice to sit down and grab a drink with the bad guy.
4431 2018-10-17 17:20:28 To put that to scale, all the uranium mined in Canada in a year, would fit comfortably inside a medium sized bathroom. 

All the oil produced in Canada in a year would fill about 160 Rogers Centers.

Just make sure that bathroom is on the ground floor....
4432 2018-10-17 17:20:25 @narendramodi Ji, I’m considering seriously NOT to vote @AnanthKumar_BJP & @BJP4India or @BJP4Karnataka but to press #NOTA since I can’t vote for #CONgress.

4436 2018-10-17 17:20:02 then why is KSA wasting millions digging a canal between KSA and Qatar.  How is that productive use of oil $?
4437 2018-10-17 17:19:51 cooking oil was just a token of appriciation from @ZGCookingOil not payment for work done. get a life
4438 2018-10-17 17:19:45 @OutnumberedOT if the Democrats have their way we would do all kinds of damage to Saudi Arabia and then oil would go to $200 a barrel and they would turn to Russia and China and buy their military equipment and then we would be sitting here holding an empty bag.
4439 2018-10-17 17:19:38 It really has come to if you're still drinking his snake oil, you're an inbecile.
4440 2018-10-17 17:19:35 Will you be selling CBD oil? Can’t see it on the website.
4441 2018-10-17 17:19:31 Good job! You must have lots in tech and very few bonds to have a number like that since oil & financials haven't done much this year. I'm at 8.5% this year, but pretty conservative with 40% bonds. Best sectors have been tech (obvs), healthcare and environmental services.
4442 2018-10-17 17:19:27 Curious what happens now with Saudi Arabia. There seems to be evidence the gov. killed a journalist. Is this a crime for int'l courts? Will there be sanctions involved? Will they be levied against things that matter like their oil? If so how does that affect the global market?
4443 2018-10-17 17:19:20 thanks for that! I shall give it a go as I am inundated with the buggers. I have always regarded aubergine as a carrier medium for olive oil if I am truthful!!
4444 2018-10-17 17:19:19 How could he know. He was busy selling oil to USA and UK and ordering more fighter jets,missiles and other defence equipment from them as well. Trump and Theresa will be his witnesses

4447 2018-10-17 17:19:07 eat that and enjoy or I will pour boiling hot oil over you husband.
4448 2018-10-17 17:19:06 I'm guessing you've already tried DHEA for inflammation? Yes to coconut oil. My Kung Fu instructor (Sifu) recommends Caprylic Acid (straight-up; no other added ingredients/supplements).         
4449 2018-10-17 17:18:59 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
4450 2018-10-17 17:18:38 This is just a rehash of the terminally flawed IPCC report.The UK has been fracking for years. The oil is needed unless you want to live like cavemen. To not understand this is wilful ignorance.
4451 2018-10-17 17:18:21 Or they have oil which is why FRD “befriended” the House of Saud in 1933. This relationship didn’t start with Trump.
4452 2018-10-17 17:18:14 They chop off heads in the middle of the street. Why is any of this surprising to anyone? 

But hey, let’s keep buying oil from these barbarians

4455 2018-10-17 17:18:01 DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BEN CARDIN: THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SAUDIS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING OF KHASHOGGI

but because we need their #OIL, we'll keep lookin the other way as they keep raping and killing people #OOTT $TSLA
4456 2018-10-17 17:17:59 Can we just rapidly phase out the use of oil, thus sorting out both climate change and the Gulf despots simultaneously?
4457 2018-10-17 17:17:59 "a growing trend sped by the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing." Great. Instead of importing oil we're screwing up our own land.

How was life in Houston after Harvey? How is life in Mexico Beach now? Hard choices are coming, some lifestyles might just end.
4458 2018-10-17 17:17:56 @BetoORourke isn’t selling snake oil like #TedCruz
4459 2018-10-17 17:17:49 USD <- OIL -> WEAPONS <- NICE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU
4460 2018-10-17 17:17:43 Perhaps the funding by oil companies affects the results of the handful of climate denying "scientists." I by handful, I mean the less than 30% who deny the established science
4461 2018-10-17 17:17:41 @CremeOfNature But why is this Creme of Nature Aragon Oil Shampoo sooo good? My hair felt smooth as I shampooed it and I mean it's almost NEVER like that. I had to uncap the bottle to get it out but I actually love that it's so thick. Nice Job!
4462 2018-10-17 17:17:32 Canada becomes the 2nd country to legalize marijuana. Personally I take pure CBD oil (not to be confused with THC) that is derived from marijuana plants. It has been a huge help to subdue my concussion symptoms, specifically anxiety and depression! Highly recommend #Canada #CBD

4469 2018-10-17 17:17:16 The collective shadow, and the shadow in each of us, is revealing itself.  The venom, the misogyny, the violent racism, the mocking and disregard of the disabled, Anti-Semitism. the danger of allegiances based on oil and guns (Saudi Arabia) where human life means nothing.
4470 2018-10-17 17:17:15 หลอนไปอีก555
4471 2018-10-17 17:17:11 I don't think there's any doubt that Trump has been laundering both Russian & Saudi money, for decades.

But the #Saudi's consider they hold all the cards(translation: oil prices), so they are probably laughing at Trump doing their PR for them!

Trump has brought this on himself!
4472 2018-10-17 17:17:05 Oil Prices have fallen as traders weighed on contradictory assessments of U.S. crude inventories before the release of government data.
4473 2018-10-17 17:17:02 Hahaha.. Kenapaaa.. 
Aku malah seneng dan makasih, soalnya ga paham beginian... 

Hooo...cleansing oil rekomendasinya apa? Untuk kulit normal tapi gampang merah agak sensitif kayak aku? *banyak tanya*
4474 2018-10-17 17:17:01 i'm going to boil myself in oil before applying. i must get it this time.
4475 2018-10-17 17:17:00 You say it will be much better than oil now, but wait until a boat load of lithium batteries sink to the bottom of the ocean off Vancouver island and then you will be changing your tune. Just subbing one hazard for another.
4476 2018-10-17 17:16:56 Possibility - if they get Trump to do something stupid with Saudis they can spike oil prices and derail economy, which is one of Trumps main selling points.
4477 2018-10-17 17:16:50 Shops in #yeg carrying CBD oil?
4478 2018-10-17 17:16:39 Fibromyalgia is not fake  it’s a chronic pain condition. For chronic pain, a combo of CBD and THC has been shown to be most helpful, vs CBD oil alone. Wish you well! 
4479 2018-10-17 17:16:39 Actually, with the turmoil in the House of Saud and they decide screw with the price of oil.. sending it higher ...that hurts GOP.  Loss of Saudi oil could benefit Russia and Iran. Iran and Russia are allied over Assaud in Syria.  All very confusing.. What does Turkey get?
4480 2018-10-17 17:16:34 @JohnGormleyShow can't get thru. WAG oil well sites.
4481 2018-10-17 17:16:18 Maybe the bird was leaking oil
4482 2018-10-17 17:16:11 WTF? America's 'basic values' are all about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and getting oil back in return... at least with Trump we don't have to listen to any of this mealy-mouthed hypocrisy!
4483 2018-10-17 17:16:10 Check your Engine oil this morning.
4484 2018-10-17 17:16:09 No bread at Spar supermarkets, they only bake a few loaves in the morning, as for cooking oil we have forgotten about it, we boil foods now, forced to be healthy lol'

4486 2018-10-17 17:16:02 OMG, there are numerous, publicly accessible, well-researched articles on the toll oil and coal are taking on the environment. For people like you, all science that opposes your imaginations, is junk. Hopefully, people who actually know how to reason will overcome idiocracy. Bye.
4487 2018-10-17 17:16:00 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
4488 2018-10-17 17:15:56 It’s not that they lace it purposefully.  It’s that residue gets left on scales from OTHER drugs and gets accidentally mixed into weed being an organic that has oil and absorbs things.  Very small amounts of fentanyl are needed to cause harm.
4489 2018-10-17 17:15:47 @RichieAllenShow CBD oil is already legal in the uk

4495 2018-10-17 17:15:25 When I see how Qatar and Saudi Arabia are using their oil money, I just sit and ask myself if Nigeria is selling coconut oil

4497 2018-10-17 17:15:18 I don't commute but I understand because I used to commute. 2php increase because of the incessant oil hike, pero I wonder bakit pag may rollback ang langis,  ang pasahe wala ding rollback? Yung mga bulok na jeep na naka slant na while running, worth ba ng increase?
4498 2018-10-17 17:15:12 Having said that; both were wrong, and Trump has obvious financial reasons, but I think the real way we should frame this is: our reliance on foreign oil requires us to routinely kow-tow to extreme regimes. Just a thought.
4499 2018-10-17 17:15:09 I can help you sweetie! I have been taking CBD Oil since March for my anxiety and other issues and I highly recommend everyone trying it!

4501 2018-10-17 17:14:54 @Wendys FYI, using soybean oil in your vinaigrette meant that I couldn't eat it or the walnuts that came with the "Apple Pecan Chicken Salad" that I just got. I wasn't given pecans or the pomegranate dressing. I can't eat soy or walnuts at all. :(
4502 2018-10-17 17:14:53 Yeah. A lady decided that there was too much fat in my cream of roasted garlic soup. The recipe for which is essentially garlic roasted in olive oil, broth, little cream, little butter. Basically, fat. Which she lovingly skimmed until it was a sludge. I thought I handled it ok.

4504 2018-10-17 17:14:49 Why do we as humans find it so hard to help ourselves? I have issues, including #insomnia & #anxiety (and #obesity). I just struggled, as a Canadian who can now buy pot online, to order some CBD/THC oil, even though I know it could help me. Why do we insist on struggling? #health
4505 2018-10-17 17:14:47 Love the Oil Packets. My truck does't have keys, and my house has a digital lock. With the packets I no longer have a need for a key chain.
4506 2018-10-17 17:14:41 Old fashioned oil, pot with a lid,and salt and butter afterwards is chemical free and yummier!!! That’s how we do it even when f it pisses my daughter off lol
4507 2018-10-17 17:14:41 The emails I would have sent but can't send.  I want you to know that I just learned what "light sweet" means, in relation to crude oil, and I thought of you.
4508 2018-10-17 17:14:38 I honestly just want there oil. Or maybe they using it for bigger things?#beverages#skincreams#edibles

This journalist’s death means nothing, absolutely nothing in the big scheme. Let’s get real, arms deals, oil, proxy
4516 2018-10-17 17:13:57 For JungKook, look up Gua-Sha.  It's a very simple technique using a curved spoon/fork handle to cause friction to increase circulation to the injured area.  You want to apply coconut oil or jojoba oil first before applying friction.  Start above heels towards the knee.
4517 2018-10-17 17:13:55 You don’t use a speedo on a track, if you had any idea at all you use the rev counter. And if you think oil, tyres and fluids checks are only for the track, do us all a favour and get off the road.. your dangerous.

4520 2018-10-17 17:13:26 So, Zinke wants to send the US Navy over to other oil producing countries and knock them out of the competition so Washington is hegemon oil producer.
These other countries have nuclear capabilities, Zinke means war?
4521 2018-10-17 17:13:21 Well if it’s the Republican Jesus he would say: take away their oil and their healthcare.
4522 2018-10-17 17:13:20 The man's Russian block clients boil their political adversaries in molten lead and/or oil.  Enough said?
4523 2018-10-17 17:13:18 Psalm 23 vs 5-6. "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever"
4524 2018-10-17 17:13:17 When your "allies" start chopping civilians into tiny pieces, I do think its time to reconsider your alliance with them #SaudiArabia  We can use coal/use our own oil  #MAGA Americans/ heads up!
4525 2018-10-17 17:13:10 you've gone from a playboy billionaire, buying the american dream, to a megachurch pastor selling snake oil
4526 2018-10-17 17:13:09 I'm too scared to try another rosehip oil since TO broke me out so bad. But im having great results with Seabuckthorn Fruit Oil and Borage Seed Oil. The SBF oil is ORANGE and I don't dilute it, but man...it's a lifesaver for scarring.
4527 2018-10-17 17:13:02 Psalm 23: 5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.
4528 2018-10-17 17:12:54 Let's be frank, they are playing with eggshells because they know Saudi Arabia is vital for oil, and they are afraid to piss them off

4531 2018-10-17 17:12:33 @JDBunkis @SportsnetBen I grew up in a super religious household where pot was looked at as evil. I've been predisposed to think that aswell. Started CBD Oil with my vape 3 weeks ago. 97% of my knee and sports pain have subsided. I dont get high. Praise the a Lord. Lol

4535 2018-10-17 17:12:04 @dpradhanbjp The last five years was a golden opportunity to invest and increase domestic oil output when the prices were low. Alas @ONGC did precious little. Where’s the accountability? Do we save dollars now or control fuel prices?
4536 2018-10-17 17:12:01 いいですね！
4537 2018-10-17 17:12:01 It amazes me at the silence of Hebrew Biafra GENOCIDE instigated by the British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas and go wild when 1 person get killed  in Arabia. TRUTH is SUPREME.
4538 2018-10-17 17:11:57 @realDonaldTrump IS A COWARD! He has financial interest w the Saudi's. Tell Americans how this man was butchered alive, decapitated, & then dissolved in acid they would all agree Saudi Arabia is no friend of the USA & we should have no arms or oil deals with them. #iWillWalk2Work
4539 2018-10-17 17:11:56 Caffeine solution works great for me, but not everyone. Going into winter, try hylauronic acid or maruca oil for dry skin.
4540 2018-10-17 17:11:50 Spending maybe 10% of what I was, including your Polar Plus sub. 15000 p.a. So about £2200 a year in fuel alone. Plus maintenance savings. No brake disks or pads in 55k miles. No oil changes or filters.
4541 2018-10-17 17:11:49 me either and all I use is oil.
4542 2018-10-17 17:11:43 went to the mechanic for an oil change and alignment.. they call me back telling me i’m 3 months past my tune up, my front tires are about to pop off, need two air filters replaced.. but bitch the weeks almost done paydays coming my skins clear im good
4543 2018-10-17 17:11:36 Taxpayer funded pipeline that’ll never see the light of day(under this govt) , oil stuck in the ground costing hard working Canadians jobs and revenue, welcoming ISIS terrirists back with open arms.......but hey, weed got weed. #LiberalLogic
4544 2018-10-17 17:11:31 "...Jack Strauss, [points] out that fracking plays a considerable part in achieving American energy independence..."

Lies. Oil is a global market. Oil supply from anywhere causes climate catastrophe--an environmental holocaust. Propagandists like Stauss are the modern Goebbels.
4545 2018-10-17 17:11:28 I'd think so, but you never know. There's probably a kale-essential oil substitute.
4546 2018-10-17 17:11:25 Oh Roberta, what do you expect when we get the majority of our oil from them? Sometimes we need to do business with the enemy. Take off those Rose-Colored glasses...Meathead...

4553 2018-10-17 17:10:22 As others have mentioned, butter. You can do the Ramsey method of low heat and constant motion, but you can do the same at higher temps. Key is getting the pan and oil hot enough before adding in the eggs. The constant stirring will break things up to give you that creamy texture

Sounds like, you have interests in Russian oil !!!!!!!

4568 2018-10-17 17:08:46 I'd think every once in a while a little spritz of oil would NOT hit you in the face when pulling little tab out of pour spout on a 5 gal bucket of oil.

I'd be thinking wrong

4570 2018-10-17 17:08:31 Trump is the 21st century version of snake oil.
4571 2018-10-17 17:08:14 But the coal, oil and gas lobbies are entrenched and powerful.  The renewable energy lobbies are, I assume, less well established.  Also, Trump is old and has a sort of hero worship for the idea of people working in mines and oil rigs. It sounds manlier to him than solar panels.
4572 2018-10-17 17:08:11 ngayon ko lang naappreciate oil pastel lmao
4573 2018-10-17 17:08:10 Everybody now is shouting "correct stew", "everywhere stew". Even the ones that dissolved tomato paste in red oil like that and without meat or fish is shouting stew. Stew kill you.

4587 2018-10-17 17:07:04 Precisely my point. Use it as the Iranians do oil. Stop or slow down production and enforce an economic change of perspective. The so called party of private enterprise can’t object to that presumably?
4588 2018-10-17 17:07:01 Lol negative but your other cousin Jordan. If you have been on the internet you should know Jones is a snake oil salesmen. Damn good one at that but still....the pack doesn't make him right but it does make him strong and strength attracts a certain type of person. #winning

4604 2018-10-17 17:05:19 They also claim that the the RBS has been on air for 13 years.  They debuted 2007.  That would make it 11 full years.  Anything to pump their resumes so they can sell more snake oil advertisements.
4605 2018-10-17 17:05:16 TGel makes my hair really dry, but does wonders for my scalp. But if I use conditioner the right way with it, my hair just needs to be washed again by the time it’s dry. Try it out, it might help. If that doesn’t help, try some Tea Tree oil hair products

4619 2018-10-17 17:04:01 Then why are we still importing oil?
4620 2018-10-17 17:03:59 The Young Turks dont care about Native Americans. Hell, Ana and Cenk laughed about the Native American's 'hippy' spirituality. Cenk showed he was all for oil pipelines over 2 yrs ago. Then Cenk decided to profit off of Standing Rock & help out Nexus. Interesting!
4621 2018-10-17 17:03:57 Every post WWII President has had to cozy up to the Saudis.  They have the oil we need.  If you don’t understand that, how are you a Congressional ‘leader’?
4622 2018-10-17 17:03:57 And 'let's have Canada buy and build the oil pipeline' Trudeau... sigh.
4623 2018-10-17 17:03:54 Oh and we don’t need to ask for your oil. Simple.

4630 2018-10-17 17:03:12 We must elect leaders at all levels that will push renewable and alternate energy sources. We must reduce our dependence on oil, it's impact on our environment, and our dependence on any country other than our own. #Resist the Republican attack on our freedoms and rights..

4635 2018-10-17 17:02:49 Yeah, especially when literally millions of jobs here are tied to oil and gas. Let's not create more jobs...
4636 2018-10-17 17:02:47 Follow the money and it’ll lead to oil.

4640 2018-10-17 17:02:33 Right so next time they send their Wahhabi terrorists to bomb the UK we just say "that's ok  do you want any more bombs and bullets." I mean their money and influence from oil is far more important than lives.
4641 2018-10-17 17:02:28 Hmm let's see - we got shafted over The Vow

4642 2018-10-17 17:02:08 Indeed the junta has reduced Zim to a destitute state. How can Zanu Pfs dirty linen be washed in public? Really, cooking oil given to national team players and some individuals justify that waywardness? What perceptions are being created?

4648 2018-10-17 17:01:38 what a load of crap, if US has plenty of oil then why are gas prices at $3.00 per gallon? 2 years ago the prices were closer to $2 per gallon.

4653 2018-10-17 17:01:17 Assuming it happened as we are being told, the Saudis felt they could take advantage of the relationships they have with other nations to do what they did with impunity. It's hard to estimate what can and cannot be done with a major oil producer with such strategic significance.

4702 2018-10-17 16:57:47 Oil and gas is a big industry in Texas, Beto wants to tax $10 dollars a barrell. Obviously Beto will not be popular to a lot of people here despite agreeing with him on some issues.

4739 2018-10-17 16:55:07 it's universally accepted that you can’t run a modern society on energy returns much below 14: 1.

fracked oil delivers about 6: 1

in fundamental economic terms, fracked wells can only continue with the energy support of conventional wells supplying about 19: 1 at best

4763 2018-10-17 16:53:04 He wasn't kidding when he told his cult he loves the uneducated. 

He was banking his whole reign as potus on the hope they'd b too stupid to realize they're all being played by a snake oil salesman. 

Amazing what propaganda can do to the weak minded.

4770 2018-10-17 16:52:39 We are already the slave capital of the rest of the world. Look at India, Japan and China. Those guys depend almost solely on their human capital because they don't have that much oil, gold, diamonds or even land. We have everything and we can barely breath.

4786 2018-10-17 16:51:33 Safaricom can give an offer of 2GB data bundles @50 Bob but it expires in one hour's time. Funny! That one our your internet will be low and you feel like you are deep in ngamia one oil well.
4787 2018-10-17 16:51:33 Just another old snake oil salesman.
4788 2018-10-17 16:51:31 This is nothing compared too what Sadia Arabia did in the past as they did 9\11 as 16 of 19 where Sadis leader Ben Laden as Oil man W.Bush's best family was the Laden family as we see this whole fascist war and killing the ones that knew too much as we all see!!
4789 2018-10-17 16:51:28 India is a diverse country. Traditionally 
Northern and Eastern was Mustard oil. West was Peanut oil. South was Sesame and Coconut oil. 
In ancient times the real cooking medium was Ghee and Butter. 
All now are shifting to heart friendly high Omega6 seed oils.
4790 2018-10-17 16:51:19 This is not the time to vote Democrat since the two parties are two cheeks of the same ass.  We need to end our oil addiction which would be the best way to not support KSA.
BTW who is blocking efforts to build batteries?  Western governments are complicit.  Period.
4791 2018-10-17 16:51:14 I come to get an oil change & they then got me to buy all kinda other shit
4792 2018-10-17 16:51:13 Iam in Mkoba Gweru doing my part not sure where you get the “diaspora bit and armchair” . As I write I am queuing for cooking oil 
4793 2018-10-17 16:51:13 Yes. He doesn't speak for me. I notice the pathetic response of Western Governments to this heinous murder.
Any sanctions imposed? Any diplomats thrown out? 
*cough* oil *cough* 
*cough* arms sales *cough*

4795 2018-10-17 16:50:32 Same way oil price has been going up since last year, almost $80 now and still this administration has not been unable to stop the GDP growth from contracting. Instead, they spending over $3billion on subsidy. Same subsidy they strongly criticised and called fraud.
4796 2018-10-17 16:50:29 I use clarifying lotion, and purifying skin tightening lotion, and sun screen is always really good, but if your skin is oily then u should use and oil control one.
4797 2018-10-17 16:50:16 Can anyone explain to me how gross input can be less than crude oil input in refineries? As its been in PADD2 in the past 2 weeks. #OOTT #Refining #Crude #RBOB #HO
4798 2018-10-17 16:50:13 Maybe its a way to make sure they just don't sell cooking oil only.
4799 2018-10-17 16:50:06 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

4805 2018-10-17 16:49:38 I can see points from different sides of the aisle. One side sees all marijuana as good, no matter if it's psychoactive or CBD. One side agrees with CBD oil for medical purposes, but is against psychoactives. The last side sees all forms as bad, regardless of it's purpose.
4806 2018-10-17 16:49:26 Toh make we fry palm oil???
4807 2018-10-17 16:49:25 Heading to #MAAM2018 pretty soon. After work and an oil change and packing a bag and ... ok, maybe not pretty soon.
4808 2018-10-17 16:49:19 Should have gotten faster shipping on the CBD oil but I ordered 3 bottles so it’s about to be lit but in that chill CBD way where it’s not lit

4813 2018-10-17 16:48:48 As my pet project, I've stripped all the plastic finish off a MIM strat, repainted it Oly White, put in some SRV picups, and finished the neck in gun oil... I need to let the lacquer dry another week. In meantime, practicing on a crappy Cort acoustic. Getting new blisters :)
4814 2018-10-17 16:48:47 lololol. Thinking we're ignorant? We've brought plenty of oil, we're staying awake and fear only the Lord! #gaslighting
4815 2018-10-17 16:48:47 No on G would bring more pollution to SLO County. Not a drop of oil extracted from Price Canyon goes into local gas tanks nor will it ever. No jobs will be lost if G passes. Everything Chevron and their minions say about G is lies. Stop being patsys for big oil. Vote yes on G.
4816 2018-10-17 16:48:46 Daesh infiltrated SDF positions and set several oil wells alight before fleeing. This likely in an attempt to pollute the air and make airstrikes more difficult. No clashes were reported.
4817 2018-10-17 16:48:45 funny thing is: they do not use that HN word... even Hindutva was not in much use until late 1980's. n BJS was agnst sarkarikaran of banks, gen insu, oil mktg, coal, whole sale grain trade etc. n PVN was... so who is RW n who is not.. not that simple!
4818 2018-10-17 16:48:45 Obama made moves by saving banks, auto industry, homeowners. Reduced foreign oil dependency. Forced regulations to steady economy. Trump’s tax cuts, cozying up to Saudi’s, fighting with Iran, tariffs.... all contributing. President affects economy - a lot.
4819 2018-10-17 16:48:39 This is a whole different level of problems beyond our control isn’t it?  I don’t begin to know if the concept of using only our oil and turning away from the Middle East is feasible  or not?
4820 2018-10-17 16:48:30 Just checking in.  Have we pin pointed yet when he said he wanted to “shut down the oil and gas industry”.
4821 2018-10-17 16:48:23 He's not perfect, but I think the man with a degree from Harvard and who built the core of the Bruins that won a Stanley Cup and continues to be a contending team 4 years after he left probably has a better idea of what he's doing than any of us fans do

4827 2018-10-17 16:47:41 Yes Saudi Arabia still has a lot of money to spend but as the world decouples from oil at an increasing rate their ability to spend will decrease and in order to diversify they need the rest of the world.

4829 2018-10-17 16:47:30 Chef Louis cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with toast.
4830 2018-10-17 16:47:26 @mverbora I got your info from cannibis news. I wanted to ask if you had any info on a direct effect improvement in the brain by injesting CBD oil in capsules form. I have theories that helps solve NPD and ADD by following a healthy no alcohol, drug and full fitness, vegan life.

4833 2018-10-17 16:47:24 he is really bowing to make sure their oil is sold in dollars
4834 2018-10-17 16:47:11 ทำไรอะโฟนนน
4835 2018-10-17 16:47:08 @JustinTrudeau will continue to buy their oil rather than build a pipeline from Alberta to eastern Canada.  Your guess why is as good as anyone’s.  He’s also welcoming home ISIS terrorists who left Canada to fight for them.  Even Jhadi Jack, a non Canadian is invited. No joke.
4836 2018-10-17 16:47:02 Your 1890s are big mad that "their" PnP (Village Walk) is being "invaded" by all "these people" who want to buy cooking oil. They "feel like they could die with all this blackness".

4837 2018-10-17 16:47:00 Cloves essential oil attracts riches, drives away negativity, produces spiritual vibrations, purifies and protects the home, or other places that may be in need of purification and protection. Wear Clove Essential Oil as a body perfume.
4838 2018-10-17 16:46:56 I’ve also made aebleskivers with the following egg replacers: aquafaba, ground flax/water, vegan yogurt, applesauce, tinned pumpkin, etc. all of them work. More important than the replacement ingredient is the temperature of the aebleskiver skillet (hot!) and using enough oil.
4839 2018-10-17 16:46:56 Hydraulic oil commonly used in trucks is normally not up to the grade required for hydraulic motors. You’d want to standardise on you tractor grade.

4851 2018-10-17 16:46:03 I kinda want to switch to renewables to stop the government from giving away billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil industry.  Don't you think they've taken enough of our tax dollars?
4852 2018-10-17 16:46:01 On this day in 1973, the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) has imposed an oil embargo by announcing a decision to cut oil exports to the United States and to provide military assistance to other countries #HIST125007F18
4853 2018-10-17 16:46:00 @ananavarro Pompeo what a useless Sec. of State, Saudis are probably not nice people but they have money and oil and that appears to be all that counts. Even if Trump looses in 2020 it will be a long time before the world trusts the US not elect another corrupt idiot.
4854 2018-10-17 16:45:49 @HalftimeReport re Oil Oil Reserves per todays EIA report down over 2 days reserves from a year ago.  Bad news for energy disruption @TheDomino
4855 2018-10-17 16:45:45 Simple. People dont trust the government to stabilise the situation. So they panic. When right people are i. Leadership people dont panic. 2008 case study.
No sane being hoads cooking oil knowing its always available.
4856 2018-10-17 16:45:41 
There are some good countries in Africa and I think in another 50 years, those nations that build their institutions will forge ahead of the rest as natural resources such as oil, diamonds etc become less of a determinant and intellectual capital becomes critical.

4865 2018-10-17 16:44:56 The big agenda here is that bin Salman has been diversifying his Kingdom's exports, as the oil tap can't last forever. Before it runs dry, and the people come for his head and turn the region into anarchy again, he's establishing a stable economy and semi-secular nation.
4866 2018-10-17 16:44:55 It's not just Trump. The West has been in thrall to Saudi Oil for the best part of a century.

4883 2018-10-17 16:43:15 If we are the largest oil producer, how come we are buying or about to buy $100 a barrel of oil from foreign countries?  

When it was at $50 a barrel, gas was $4.00-$5.00 a gallon, I guess that will be double?

4894 2018-10-17 16:42:39 For the fact the we have the second largest oil reserve in the world after Saudi Arabia, I cannot help but wonder if  there’s really a long term intent to reduce us from an influential middle power country to a third world socialist state. Scary sinister plan. Vote libs out!

4900 2018-10-17 16:42:18 We buy oil from Saudi. They purchased over $100b of arms which gets us jobs. We need them to pressure Iran. Russia could set military bases there.

4914 2018-10-17 16:41:02 I believe with all the companies and the manufacturing returning plus being number1 oil and gas supplier.Will eventually pay down the national debt. The president has done wonderful things for the country in a short time. 6 more yrs he’ll get more done.
4915 2018-10-17 16:40:59 We should boycott Saudi oil. They aren't as important or powerful as they pretend to be. We'd wreck their economy. There's plenty of other places to get oil from!
4916 2018-10-17 16:40:58 Suggests that the "Gold/oil ratio" trade will not work gradually, but all at once.  Another "temperature gauge" on this whole situation is "How are US relations with major oil exporters (including Saudi) & China today v. 12-18 months ago?"  :)
4917 2018-10-17 16:40:56 The container is full of MOTOR OIL. This does not seem useful to you right now.
4918 2018-10-17 16:40:53 Thank you for your insightful comment on the global problem. This would be kind of like oil floating on water.
4919 2018-10-17 16:40:41 “America’s historic reliance on Saudi Arabia for oil and arms deals, and more immediate self-interested need to support the Saudis in their raging Middle Eastern power struggle with the likes of Iran and Turkey, should not override its commitment to democracy and human rights.”
4920 2018-10-17 16:40:41 The secret to a centuries old finish is as with a violin. Control the leveling. Use thin layers. 20x then steel wool between. An oil varnish with turpentine, bees wax,  as if building a patina. It should compliment the wood, not change it.
4921 2018-10-17 16:40:31 Gavin is a Snake Oil Salesman. People want to believe in what he’s selling because he’s so convincing. But it can likely kill them.

4924 2018-10-17 16:40:23 I agree oil price would surge, however the West would not be destroyed. There’s oil in Kuwait, Qatar, Angola, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, U.S, Mexico, Venezuela etc.

Stay on topic.
4935 2018-10-17 16:39:32 This is weird but every time I smell like old oil like in the street it reminds me of my first house that I grew up in the garage it’s spelled exactly like that super musty and like my daddy to clean the floors!!

that was fun. Hope you have a great day!


4936 2018-10-17 16:39:32 He told us that without faith in Christ the anointing oil is just olive oil in a bottle.
In the book of John chapter 9, Jesus used clay and spittle to heal a blind man.
The man didn't receive healing only because of the clay and spittle but by  faith and obedience in Christ.

4940 2018-10-17 16:39:21 You already know the answer to that, too. It’s “no.” Small business will be stuck paying the carbon tax while you exempt transnational corporations. 

No wonder all the oil companies support a carbon tax!

I do still wonder, though, why you pretend to be a friend of small biz?
4941 2018-10-17 16:39:10 Not all CBD oil is the same! Don't think you can get these type of results with other inferior products that might not even have CBD in them, we post our 3rd party lab tests right on our website so you know you are getting PURE PCR CBD oil
4942 2018-10-17 16:39:04 What science are you referring to? Climate dooms sayers don’t look at the science, they look at claims of consensus. They don’t even define their terms or look at the nuance of the situation. Instead they call for an end to oil while sitting in comfortable rooms heated with oil.

On tuesday our brother shared with us he mentioned that our faith shouldn't be in the anointing oil only but should be built in Christ.
4952 2018-10-17 16:38:25 I talked last week to the wife of a retired SEAL who said the CBD oil he’s using is *THE* reason why he now gets decent sleep. She said he tried every type of sleeping pill without success.
4953 2018-10-17 16:38:22 Trump just wants all of that money that Saudi is going to give him personally after doing Iran in so Saudi can take over his oil business

4957 2018-10-17 16:37:59 Our "friendship" is built upon their oil. Plain and simple.
4958 2018-10-17 16:37:57 Last I heard we only get 8-9% of our oil from SA.  It’s not patriotic to allow this to get dismissed.  This article is disgusting.  One of our citizens was murdered and we need to respond.

4965 2018-10-17 16:37:37 That's but one facet of a vast profiteering endeavor. There's also the acquisition of oil & natural gas reserves, the Saudis get to flex the fruits of their recent arms purchases while US gets rich off the arms sales. Sure, it's more expensive to invade than buy out but when...

4967 2018-10-17 16:37:29 @GillianHTurner i have a question? What would be the benefit for the Saudi's to kill a reporter and a US citizen? They would run the risk of sanctions from the world, and in turn can turn off the oil  to us and Europe? I just dont see it.

4975 2018-10-17 16:36:49 I'd have to be sure that any oil is organic & non-GMO for making personal products. As for fuel, a guy named @JaxAustin is burning plain-old filtered recycled oil he gets from restaurants to run his bus. He has a video where a mechanic named Badge showed how to make it possible.

4980 2018-10-17 16:36:27 2% annualized growth certainly isn’t a boom, Its average. 

You can thank a weaker Canadian dollar, strong growth in the US and soaring oil prices for that 2%, not any of Trudeau’s polices

Let’s also not forget our stock market is serverly underperforming that of the US

You have no principles, only the vice of greed, by which you justify your acceptance of the King's lie. You are a modern day Judas, selling out the truth for oil.

4995 2018-10-17 16:34:48 If the U.S. is the largest producer of oil and gas then, why don’t we control the market? OPEC controls the market because combined, they produce more and sell more. You can produce all you want but,  the only way to get the price down is to flood the market.
4996 2018-10-17 16:34:37 bro,let’s not forget that OBJ/ATIku came into power just when oil price were skyrocketing. We seem to forget that with the resources at their disposal then they could have set us on a path to greatness but instead they decided to set themselves and their families up for life.

5030 2018-10-17 16:32:02 A. America has caused a tone of the worlds problems due to its lust for oil and other riches- you don't get to say "we are not the worlds baby sitter".

5031 2018-10-17 16:32:02 A constructive view of the WoodMac model would be, say: a slower, difficult molting phase--and then we get a beautiful butterfly in 2035.

#CleanCarStandards save drivers money at the pump, curb #greenhousegases, and reduce oil consumption and #airpollution.
5043 2018-10-17 16:31:03 The truth is PDP Government had the time/resources to turn this country into Eldorado. Crude oil price was high. They had the opportunity to build roads, rails, improved on health care, power, education but they looted all the money for 16ys.

Corruption kills faster than Bullet.
5044 2018-10-17 16:30:59 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
5045 2018-10-17 16:30:57 Bring my car in for an oil change and find out i need a new battery
5046 2018-10-17 16:30:53 DYD? Coconut oil it is really good in moderation although 80% is saturated fat it does not contribute to cardiovascular disease. Coconut oil has an antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-viral, and antifungal properties.
5047 2018-10-17 16:30:52 Apparently the judge who imposed the prison sentences on the anti- fracking demonstrators has family connections with the oil and gas industry.
5048 2018-10-17 16:30:39 Oil Down 2% on Supply Build; $100 Bet Looks More Distant
5049 2018-10-17 16:30:32 Why do you have to buy your oil from them? Canada holds the world‘s third largest proven oil reserves. Bonus ,we don’t execute journalists

5051 2018-10-17 16:30:27 If you love foul green slime making soup of you canals, oil and red tide in your gulf, dead fish on your beaches instead of tourists, then you should vote republican.
5052 2018-10-17 16:30:19 So tight my oil pen died on me when I need it at work to cruise through. All good though
5053 2018-10-17 16:30:14 What good did it do for Chavez to basically give away the oil wealth with no provision for leaner times? The extreme poor from the democratic era are not alone. They are now joined by what’s left of the middle class. I’ll take Punto Fijo over this disaster any day of the week
5054 2018-10-17 16:30:12 captured. gov't and regulators are full captured by big oil.
5055 2018-10-17 16:30:09 Coconut Oil season among us!!
Lol wonders for the skin.
5056 2018-10-17 16:30:06 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
5057 2018-10-17 16:30:01 So that oil shoots up to $200/barrel 2 weeks before the election.  John Brennan demands immediate consequences, which should tell everyone in no uncertain terms that we should do absolutely nothing until incontrovertible proof is in.

5059 2018-10-17 16:29:58 The Saudi's #Wahhabism makes them the #Evangelicals of #Islam They also were very important when they controled the price of oil which ended during Obama's presidency
5060 2018-10-17 16:29:58 Oil & money, with a little bit of "keep your friends close, your enemies closer" thrown in.
5061 2018-10-17 16:29:47 Oil industry provides jobs. Keeps folks busy. Folks who are busy and making money don't rock the boat and thanks to Synergy Alberta have been trained to think we're all in this together. Some of us are watching this system (I am) with amusement. Politicians part of this crap.
5062 2018-10-17 16:29:44 The MSM express little concern, when on a daily basis, people of Saudi Arabia are stoned, beheaded, tortured, subjugated by slavery and other atrocities.  Saudia Arabia does not share our values.  The only value that unites us is OIL!  Where to go from here?
5063 2018-10-17 16:29:39 Snake oil salesmen @realDonaldTrump at it again....
5064 2018-10-17 16:29:38 I wouldn't exactly know why COMCASA they are opting and adopting. Integration and smooth info exchange b/w US allies n Indian forces.

Iran is business as before, as far as i hear n see in public domain. Iran oil processing refineries in India, insurance firms some changes 2day.

5067 2018-10-17 16:29:22 John, you have it ass backward.
Seventies oil crises were pre-negotiated events, ask Kissinger or check different supporting sources on this, I have tons.
The US are and never were in Middle East to "steal the oil", they are there for price preventing falling and that it goes to
5068 2018-10-17 16:29:12 i’m bleaching my hair this weekend so i’ve been putting coconut oil in it + not washing it to try and reduce damage but sjdjdkdk it feels so gross and dirty how am i supposed to survive 2 more days like this
5069 2018-10-17 16:29:11 #TodayInHistory 
1777- Patriots win Battle of Saratoga 
1835- First resolution creating the Texas Rangers is approved
1931- Al Capone goes to prison
1973- OPEC enacts oil embargo
1989- Loma Prieta earthquake strikes San Francisco
5070 2018-10-17 16:29:10 It's swamp without sponsorship ...you just see the oil 60 billion years later XD
5071 2018-10-17 16:29:10 I thought that one is worse than all of them.. The oil stuff ryt???
5072 2018-10-17 16:28:58 Why do they keep saying edibles are not available when you can buy infused oil (to cook with or eat raw).
5073 2018-10-17 16:28:57 And I am a Eskimo. Well I do like cold weather. Can I get my state issued oil check now? After all I have more Inuit heritage than warren has Native American. By which I mean I have none. Just like warren. Of course Idon’t have any family that werepart of driving thetrail oftears

5075 2018-10-17 16:28:51 Its one I won't soon forget. Also I found oil a couple minutes later on the middle shelf which just made the situation worse and more memorable.
5076 2018-10-17 16:28:49 All of them! As long as it is cooked properly aldente and is a high quality imported semolina pasta (not Ronzoni or Barilla mass produced stuff) I am happy even if it just has some olive oil and parm on it!
5077 2018-10-17 16:28:47 So IMO sure be proud of the huge project that has been the creation of an oil industry based on illusions, lies, captive political parties but at least face the truth that we're going to be paying ultimately for liabilities that the industry will walk away from because of us. Us.
5078 2018-10-17 16:28:40 Honestly I question if there's an authoritative voice on this because social seems to come with so much snake oil and wishy washy science.
5079 2018-10-17 16:28:36 The goto and best sub Has gotta be Tukery, Ham, Salami - BananaPeppers, BlackOlives, ShreddedLettuce, Oil&Vinegar - TOASTED.... YAS
5080 2018-10-17 16:28:33 I hate Kasich! Made life miserable at Ohio EPA.  In fact, shortly after he came into office a lot of senior employees retired.  He hired a Director from NY that nobody liked at Ohio EPA.  Kasich was in cahoots with the coal/oil folk & tried to issued an expedited fracking permit
5081 2018-10-17 16:28:32 Yes it is. Remember how OR will nevwr run outta trees? They harvesting 30 yr old trees now. No trees no water. Simples as that. Trees go extinct then clouds will go extinct. we outta b planting hemp 4 our new industry. Oil food wood paper textiles livestock feed two harvests a yr
5082 2018-10-17 16:28:11 The best government oil money can buy.
5083 2018-10-17 16:28:03 Twitter peeps need to gain some feedback ya’ll please. 

So to those of you who cook or have an interest in cooking, please pick one of the following options from the question below.

Which oil do you think is healthier to use/cook with ?
5084 2018-10-17 16:27:40 In my village in Eldoret, someone poured used car engine oil in a well because the owner of the well did not allow them to draw water from it. Now the water cannot be used.
5085 2018-10-17 16:27:38 Its their Karma calling. They came as traders & did monkey balancing btwn Hindus & mslms & eventually colonised the Subcontinent. Subjugated Dharma. Sided mslms post 1947 to sell arms for oil & imperial lifestyles.
Now peacefuls gvg thm taste of their own medicine on their soil.
5086 2018-10-17 16:27:30 CBD oil helps me sleep like a rock instead of lying awake with my mind racing about "that one thing that happened that one time" so thumbs up from me
5087 2018-10-17 16:27:24 Well I'm yet to try that beard oil. 

It's not as simple as it seems. There's what we call lining, at least that's what we call it in Zambia. My beard grows very fast, so I have to go get it lined at least twice a week.  Plus some post beard care too
5088 2018-10-17 16:27:24 The whole human right agenda is bullshit. It’s not a secret that the UK govt. with the American govt. r in bed with saudis for oil. This new found hate against Saudi Arabia is just paper talk. They are the necessary evil the world needs.
5089 2018-10-17 16:27:21 Kahit malayo, kahit nakakatakot lumabas padin ako para sa sigarilyo. Ganun ko siya kamahal  tsana oil
5090 2018-10-17 16:27:11 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
5091 2018-10-17 16:27:05 Idea is to make molten NaOH solidify rapidly on careful addition into vigorously stirred oil. Very little water residue in molten NaOH and moderate final mixture temperature should theoretically prevent flask damage. Also the thermal stress on glass looks quite acceptable.
5092 2018-10-17 16:26:54 “His burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.” - Isaiah 10:27
5093 2018-10-17 16:26:53 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
5094 2018-10-17 16:26:43 Oshea I prefer it fried with palm oil 
5095 2018-10-17 16:26:34 Its terrible. We can’t get it in SC at all. Ppl that cld really benefit from it have to go underground. I use CBD oil thanks to my grandson. It’s ridiculous.
5096 2018-10-17 16:26:31 Mind U,govt expenditure is not like U wanting to buy Akara the following morning. It's a process, planning, meetings, a lot of paper work madam.The plan has been on going, and is also a function of funds availability. Now that the oil price is up, n govt reserve improve, they pay
5097 2018-10-17 16:26:30 Et pourquoi pas marier les deux, style une bande plus ou moins large d'olive oil sur l'autre (je me demande si ça ressortirait vraiment, ceci dit ? Sinon, oui, au plafond, il est magnifique !
5098 2018-10-17 16:26:30 You want us to start delivering our tweets by hand? Don't knock our oil and gas you crazy hippie!!
5099 2018-10-17 16:26:27 If getting funding from Big Oil disqualifies climate researchers, shouldn't the same be true for those who get their funding from Big Government?
5100 2018-10-17 16:26:18 So are you advocating WW3 or being cut off from our oil supply because of bad diplomacy and jumping to conclusions?
5101 2018-10-17 16:26:17 obama would and kissed the saudis ass just as much america needs them to sell there oil for dollars only
5102 2018-10-17 16:26:11 We need to end our need for their oil so we don't need them. If they do illegal shit they should be punished.
5103 2018-10-17 16:25:59 U get oil for head...hahahhaha
5104 2018-10-17 16:25:55 Hhayi oil and water
5105 2018-10-17 16:25:52 I think I'm the only person that I know that doesn't rate NUXE cosmetics. "The oil is out of this world"...not for me it isn't
5106 2018-10-17 16:25:49 Dude I seriously need to do the CBD oil, I know my roommate and theo both swear by it for migraines. Idk why I didnt think about it for this
5107 2018-10-17 16:25:45 Mustard oil isn't too bad, similar to olive oil.
5108 2018-10-17 16:25:18 ... with olive oil 1 kernel deep on the bottom. 

Now it has a bit more fat but it's a healthy fat and it keeps us regular.
5109 2018-10-17 16:25:18 Thank you so much! I have fibromyalgia as well even though some people think it’s fake. I am working on my masters degree so always busy and it’s hard to deal with this. I will try the oil and see 
5110 2018-10-17 16:25:17 How much America still buy oil from other countries? Please give me a break.
5111 2018-10-17 16:25:13 CBD oil cleaned out already
5112 2018-10-17 16:25:12 Joint is 87% oil, and I know  because I used to make it. On top of that, it’s nowhere good enough to drench my shit in it like I’ve seen people do. But whatever makes you happy 
5113 2018-10-17 16:25:11 Well...the plumber did..he unblocked my pipes.
5114 2018-10-17 16:25:09 Cambridge Analytics is working hard tonight for @TedCruz & clearly the oil and gas industry. 

Look at these identical tweets at identical times from various accounts. Not original human responses.

Vote for @BetoORourke & real Texans & not just special interests.

#TexasDebate
5115 2018-10-17 16:25:05 One problem:

5116 2018-10-17 16:25:00 .@SenTomlinson: Rolling back protections from oil & gas pollution with this lobbyist-fueled bill in the final days of the legislative session is an affront to PA families and a giveaway to industry special interests. #HB2154
5117 2018-10-17 16:24:44 YALL DONT EVEN CHECK OIL OR ANYTHING JUST GO river could never
5118 2018-10-17 16:24:42 The carrot is baked into the cake while the fruit is haphazardly thrown in there..also vegetable oil is a common ingredient in cake receipts and FYI the dough used for baking comes from vegetables..xoxo
5119 2018-10-17 16:24:41 I partied my face off yesterday after work. (X-rays, oil change, picked up scripts)
5120 2018-10-17 16:24:37 I wish one of the politicians would say why the U.S. is so attached to the Saudi government.  The petro dollar.  The Saudi's used their position in OPEC to force oil to be sold using U.S. dollars.  THAT is why we back them.
5121 2018-10-17 16:24:35 & that is true. But it would seem we have global growth slowing. Multinationals are bringing global earnings back to a stronger USD and fighting higher oil prices vs. 1-2 year ago, higher interest rates etc. It's the rate of change that matters most to equities, no?
5122 2018-10-17 16:24:31 At the Permian Basin International Oil Show this morning! Come see us! #PBIOS #saulsbury #engineeringROCS
5123 2018-10-17 16:24:29 Oil, debt and Iran: Weapons in any US-Saudi fight over Khashoggi
5124 2018-10-17 16:24:15 Plastic is made of oil

Almost everything is made of plastic, or mostly plastic

Do they own ANYTHING?

A part from that, ANYTHING they own or consume usually requires transport or energy to be created

Do they own ANYTHING?
5125 2018-10-17 16:23:52 my little niece who is barely 3yrs old, just grabbed some oil, came up to me, put her hand on my forehead and started praying for me. my heart.. 
5126 2018-10-17 16:23:50 Donation is busy body and overtly unnecessary. @atiku is encouraging vandalism. May be has a hand in the pipeline vandalism that ravaged the entire oil producing communities.
5127 2018-10-17 16:23:47 They spoke out against republicans creating enemies out of Muslims in order to get support for a war that was secretly only about oil
5128 2018-10-17 16:23:32 Did they enjoy it?
5129 2018-10-17 16:23:28 if you buy into the stupid china concentration camps bullshit or are legitimately upset about the saudi oil lobby wapo "reporter" taking a vacation to the chemical dump in a barrel full of acid then you're not allowed to make fun of other people for being liberals.
5130 2018-10-17 16:23:28 We need to start building Automobiles that don't use gasoline/oil already.  Had we started affordable cars in 2007 in 2018 national socialist regimes like SArabia & Syria wouldn't be able to make War against their own people
5131 2018-10-17 16:23:26 As in don’t want them to start pricing their oil in EUR? Just my opinion but I think it’s overblown. USD will always be reserve currency for foreseeable future. And frankly with a slightly lower USD maybe the tariff madness stops.
5132 2018-10-17 16:23:16 Wait what? The US is a net oil exporter? Even Trump would think that’s too big a lie!
5133 2018-10-17 16:23:05 While I was waiting to do an @BNNBloomberg interview about Saudi and oil, I listened to an entire report on the cannabis markets. It was treated like a commodity
5134 2018-10-17 16:22:53 As much as I want full Rec with oils and edibles now, maybe the gov't is onto something here? The options are confusing for people 'in the know' let alone first timers... imagine if they had vape pens (oil), edibles, beverages etc. Available today? Would be a shit show
5135 2018-10-17 16:22:31 Beginning to suspect Junior was the expansive figure, maybe suggested introducing an oil drizzler into the condiments-based tactical chats but was shouted down before he hit his stride. I'll always wonder what might've been...
5136 2018-10-17 16:22:31 I see nothing wrong with someone being proud of having American Indian in their DNA.  Speaker Ryan, concentrate on honesty in politics, not snake oil and lies..
5137 2018-10-17 16:22:31 If the owner has been using 20W50 oil to service that Camry, don't touch it even if they dash you for N500k
5138 2018-10-17 16:22:18 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
5139 2018-10-17 16:22:18 It's a pretty rich oil & I have to be careful — I don't use very much at all. One to two drops after my night moisturizer, now that it's getting cold. Especially helpful if you decide to do a chemical exfoliant or peel.
5140 2018-10-17 16:22:15 If we are now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, the why are we paying over $3.00 at the pump?
5141 2018-10-17 16:22:09 And yet gas, oil, diesel and the deficit keep going up.
5142 2018-10-17 16:22:02 So they didn't just do this in Iraq...why? Why instead risk trillions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives and the international community instead? It's almost like the war wasn't about oil.
5143 2018-10-17 16:21:57 @Suncor is not the one "using" all the oil. The industry is the one deciding to produce the oil. @OilGasCanada has not factored in liabilities because Tapcal Trust Fund PCs did the smoothing of the way for them as per the Klein guy. If it were polluter pay, there would  be no biz
5144 2018-10-17 16:21:55 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
5145 2018-10-17 16:21:42 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
5146 2018-10-17 16:21:28 @KCCAED and @KCCAUG 

My #JeXIT wish is that Acacia Avenue entire road be repaved from City Oil up to the Golf Club.

It is a very bumpy road with patches 'ebiraka' all over yet it is in a very high value property area (Kololo).

You can even get indigestion along that stretch.
5147 2018-10-17 16:21:20 Why is the US so interested in Jamal Khashoggi? Was he CIA? Brutal slaying yes but it happens everyday, in most every country. Follow the oil, I mean money.
5148 2018-10-17 16:21:13 Did America not import 43% crude oil supply from Canada in 2017?  And yet we are labelled as a security threat.
5149 2018-10-17 16:21:07 takin shots of black seed oil cuz my tummy hurts
5150 2018-10-17 16:21:07 Because SOLAR is so cheap and reliable with 9” of snow that just fell covering them? The wind  turbines southeast of #Boulder turn maybe once a week? Someday maybe - looking forward to it. Until then, don’t want to be dependent on Middle East Oil. #COpolitics #COgov #NoTo112
5151 2018-10-17 16:21:02 People ask me how I manage to get up at 4am to study every morning. Well the answer is that I wake up and chug some mct oil, listen to Whitney Houston and hit some asthma meds.
5152 2018-10-17 16:20:59 They also throw fuck tons of money at Trump and other most egregious snake oil salesmen of American capitalism.
5153 2018-10-17 16:20:58 Oh, I don't know, Ben Nelson has worked to keep FL coasts free of oil rigs, capped student loan interest rates, helped bring space jobs to FL, and led efforts to combat the ZIKA virus.
5154 2018-10-17 16:20:56 Anyways u guys will run out of money even before run out oil. Money is scarce resource.Those brides u r paying to west&failed adventures like yemen will soon dry your wealth.U r no egypt/pakistan(run by natives), you are like Libya, once money dries those expats leave..
5155 2018-10-17 16:20:56 I AM FEELING VERY CALLED OUT.  (Also, I love the contact case as packing container! It's exactly the right amount for one week of many things I use--face lotion, hair serum, night face oil, etc.-- and doesn't leak!)
5156 2018-10-17 16:20:53 But we need oil Charles! It's not like we have a giant pool of the stuff buried under Canadian soil that we could develop ourselves
5157 2018-10-17 16:20:50 It sure is! And it can be done. I'm working on getting all my ducks in a row to get a skoolie bus with diesel engine to run on veggie oil, haul my lil car (future e-car) behind it with enough solar panels on roof of trailer/garage so it charges inside while I travel or chill.
5158 2018-10-17 16:20:50 There is a dark side to many entities in our life:  KKK, motorcycle gangs, the mob, etc.  To keep these entities from performing their dirty deeds, there needs to be pushback and controls.  Retribution needs to weigh heavier than the crime.  Sacrifice oil costs 4 sake of justice?
5159 2018-10-17 16:20:47 Qual è stato l'errore del Venezuela, invece? 
Mi risulta che abbiano moneta sovrana ma non sono stati capaci di far fronte all'abbassamento dei prezzi del petrolio (causa shale oil USA) e conseguente calo dei profitti derivanti da esso.
5160 2018-10-17 16:20:44 ไม่หล่อของมึงแต่คือหล่อของกูจ้า 
5161 2018-10-17 16:20:40 the sauidis sell there oil for dollars hence the petro dollar system
5162 2018-10-17 16:20:36 beard oil and exfoliate!

5165 2018-10-17 16:20:27 Doing some palm oil research - I had no idea it's in bars of soap. So that's my last bar of soap (an alternative will take its place!)
Kit-Kats, Colgate and Doritos also now off limits.

5167 2018-10-17 16:20:19 Despite gruesome recordings Trump admin supports Saudis: NPR yesterday reported on how we don't get that much business or oil from Saudis and "they need us more than we need them"--thus why the pussyfooting around? Of course it being NPR they don't mention the "I" word. Israel.
5168 2018-10-17 16:20:15 We do E.B. any time there’s meat in a meal. I got a Smart Balance with olive oil yesterday- it was like $1.00 cheaper. 

I don’t have mean things to say about it. I still want butter on my popcorn- but if I had to use something else- it would be O.K.
5169 2018-10-17 16:20:15 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm gay!
5170 2018-10-17 16:20:12 Je crois que je vais mettre l'olive oil au plafond, je n'ai pas le cœur d'y renoncer complètement.
5171 2018-10-17 16:20:11 Watch China and Russia and Turkey they are after the oil deal
5172 2018-10-17 16:20:10 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
5173 2018-10-17 16:19:59 @CannabisNews can you recommend any info on injesting cbd oil to help with brain/chemical behavior issues?
5174 2018-10-17 16:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5175 2018-10-17 16:19:51 Saudis (Sunni) or Iran (Shia).  They're both barbarically evil.  And they'd starve without the oil that the West discovered.

The US must continue developing our own resources.  Let the barbarians fight each other to the death and starve.
5176 2018-10-17 16:19:44 Go to China , Russia and the Middle East that’s where you’ll find the pollution. In the US oil industry 35 years, the US has reduced majority of  emissions exponentially, handles VOC’s with environmental responsibility. You don’t know what your talking about! Venezuela is you!
5177 2018-10-17 16:19:36 Saudi Arabia does very little for the US. Screws the world on oil, funds terrorist worldwide, killing millions in Yemen, 15 of the 19 9/11 perpetrators were Saudis, Bin Laden was Saudi. The GOP is owned by the NRA, Putin/Russia, and Saudi Arabia.
5178 2018-10-17 16:19:32 Since you're a #trumper troll I'm not sure l should bother to respond but if @WhiteHouse wants to boast about oil production then let's also address the consequences of that boast! So what is the point of the discussion then?
5179 2018-10-17 16:19:32 We don’t NEED their oil. That’s why the left is all upset over fracking.

5183 2018-10-17 16:19:12 I don't remember when the US launched a massive invasion of Colombia to gain oil.

5189 2018-10-17 16:18:35 Oil popped on stove. Use avocado or peanut oil for benefits. Micro popped has too many chemicals. Air is dull.  Have a good popcorn party.
5190 2018-10-17 16:18:33 Bio oil sama acnes nya beli dimana ?
5191 2018-10-17 16:18:26 Iraq clearly started a cascading series of wars of economic pillaging, which were justified as a "war on terror." They no longer even seek to justify it.

Also, why bring up South America, as if the US hasn't also started wars of aggression for oil and political expediency there?
5192 2018-10-17 16:18:24 Oil and gas pollute air and water, however.
5193 2018-10-17 16:18:21 @SecPompeo hey forget protecting journalists right and punishing the kidnapping, tortue and murder of someone... its fine ya know oil right.  Thanks for keeping America safe

5207 2018-10-17 16:17:06 In other words....FOX supports the killing of journalists, just like YOUR president would.  ANYTHING for oil.  $$$   The Saudis aren't our friends- they are our masters. THEY own us.  WE need them.  Once again, Chump is gutless and kow-towed down to dictators.  ALWAYS does.
5208 2018-10-17 16:17:06 Ghee, no oil
5209 2018-10-17 16:16:59 yeah and the tea tree oil is taking a while, i need to face mask
5210 2018-10-17 16:16:51 I'm a realist. Mankind does not control the climate. It has changed multiple times over millions of years. Oil is a natural result of those millions of years. Maybe you should get with the program.

5212 2018-10-17 16:16:43 @OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump we don’t want to take action that will harm the US.  Keep the arms deal in place, but cut oil imports from OPEC by 25%.  I they increase oil to $200 a barrel, as they threatened, cut out another 25%.  We have plenty oil!!
5213 2018-10-17 16:16:34 #American airlines American needs to hire some mechanics to maintain their fleet.  Boarded a flight from Nashville to LA this am.  We left late because the engines needed oil.  Landed at LA to find the aircraft in our gate is broke down!
5214 2018-10-17 16:16:22 Well, you lucky guys, now you will have the Indian Prime Minister working under you.
(May be that's why oil prices were allowed to go through the roof? )
5215 2018-10-17 16:16:22 The environmental consequence of oil isn't just in emissions. It's our failure since good old Klein error to hold the polluter responsible for the damages. We're now responsible according to Redwater decision for env liabilities of bankrupt oil companies.  @MargMcCuaigBoyd
5216 2018-10-17 16:16:21 “During the appeal it emerged that the judge... has family links to the oil and gas industry.
Judge Robert Altham’s father and sister run JC Altham and Sons. The company is believed to be part of the supply chain for energy giant Centrica”

Surely his position is now untenable?
5217 2018-10-17 16:16:10 Trump does not care one way or another for oil barons.  They aren't his crowd of oligarchs.  He is cozying up to the global despots that the "mainstream" GOP direct.  Lest you think Bush, Cheney et al have lost their influence--oil still rules.
5218 2018-10-17 16:16:10 Correction: this is all about oil,  weapons sales profits going to certain U.S. manufacturers, as it has now for decades.  You think Obama did anything contrary to this while in office??
5219 2018-10-17 16:16:07 What have I been telling you people? The news media is materialist, protect their sponsors, and will never tell you the truth about pharmaceutical company lying about their products; tobacco company lying about their products; oil company lying about their products. #science
5220 2018-10-17 16:16:06 I really really really love palm oil. It makes everything taste better.
5221 2018-10-17 16:16:06 The Paris Accords? What Paris Accords? solar and wind energy is surpassing oil, gas and coal in profits and cleanliness. So why is the GOP clinging to oil and gas? Lobbyists, super pacs, dirty money and corruption. Beto is promoting wind and solar. Get onboard Texas!! Vote Beto.
5222 2018-10-17 16:15:52 So much for that America first mentality. Guess that Saudi blood money and tainted oil means more than an American’s life 
5223 2018-10-17 16:15:48 Wasn’t Nazi Germany an important business ally before WW2? Didn’t Japan attack us bc we wouldn’t sell them oil/materials bc of their aggression?
5224 2018-10-17 16:15:48 They didn't exactly insert puppet leaders, they installed an embryonic democracy. To this day, 40% of US oil comes from....Canada. Hell, the US gets more oil from Colombia than Iraq.

5231 2018-10-17 16:15:15 We are helping KSA murder & starve millions in Yemen. Saudis are brutal people. They still use crucifixion but at least chop off the head beforehand. That's their version of humane treatment.  We should sanction,cut ties - but oil rules.
5232 2018-10-17 16:15:13 Mabes was so excited about today being his birthday he almost to change out the fryer oil during the crucial breakfast-to-lunch changeover during his shift at Burger King.
5233 2018-10-17 16:15:13 So in your estimation, we didn’t go into Iraq to secure oil. Ok got it.
5234 2018-10-17 16:15:10 Bro this delusional  is ONLY concerned about his bottom line, political gain. If he speaks against the Saudi’s the price of oil will go up and the GOP will lose more votes in the impending mid-terms. Sad!

5245 2018-10-17 16:14:36 When people talk about the "Green Revolution" in agriculture, it's because the science came in. Some people today would use the old "oil of vitriol" because a name such as "dihydrogen monoxide" scares them.
5246 2018-10-17 16:14:33 Its about oil and guns!!every one understand it
5247 2018-10-17 16:14:27 It was under Obama as well, why are US #gasoline prices soaring? Could it be we are exporting our oil? Another @realDonaldTrump #tax on the middle class? You bet
5248 2018-10-17 16:14:23 The world would respond in a minute if it found out that Palestine had oil. Muslim lives don’t really matter do they. We are only seen as violent terrorists. We don’t hurt or bleed. We don’t cry or mourn. We don’t love or comfort. The future will remind us of our guilty past

5252 2018-10-17 16:13:54 It may have escaped your notice that Saudi Arabia has also nationalised their oil.
5253 2018-10-17 16:13:51 First thing I typically ask in a restaurant is, "what kind of oil do you cook with".

5265 2018-10-17 16:12:03 Stop selling them weapons, would hurt our economy and jobs and they’d cooperate less with Iran. The oil card if they played it would put us into instant recession and $150 oil

5274 2018-10-17 16:11:38 I'm not sober, but! if you have access to CBD oil, this may also do well for your anxiety. there's no THC, which means it does not give you a "high" feeling. many of my friends use it for their own anxiety and say that it changed their lives in terms of calming them.
5275 2018-10-17 16:11:35 I hope you run out of motor oil lol

5278 2018-10-17 16:11:23 Tell that to OPEC, TRAIN only contributed a little to the pump prices majority of it is because of the global increase of crude oil.

5280 2018-10-17 16:11:18 Now this should come as no surprise to anyone.... Oil money trickles to everything and yes many US cos run on this directly or indirectly. Also remember the Saudi/UAE currencies are hardpegged to USD and used in OIL trade.
5281 2018-10-17 16:11:08 I wouldn't be voting Labour if they didn't. I know universal clean energy is possible & what we should be chasing. Not oil wars or fracking our earth, literally killing nature again on a mass scale.

5289 2018-10-17 16:10:18 "Ever since the modern US–Saudi relationship began in 1945, the United States has been willing to overlook many of the kingdom's more controversial aspects as long as it kept the oil flowing and supported U.S. national security policies." (Wikipedia)
5290 2018-10-17 16:10:17 If I can price oil & gold in CNY, I can control the int'l trade value of the USD & by extension, CNY/USD.  I continue to think most energy analysts thinking way too "small picture" on the potential implications/goals of this CNY oil contract.
5291 2018-10-17 16:10:14 The US is now the biggest oil producer on Earth.

Iran is not "VITAL" to anyone... 

If you want to continue fighting Saudi Arabia's wars, then stop whining about paying for them.
5292 2018-10-17 16:10:12 If we have to live off Saudi oil and our manufacturing has to have their money., and we help them kill everyone in Yemen, we have no moral compass. We have lost our way. Break ALL ties. Bring respect back again.

5294 2018-10-17 16:10:06 If you study history, you will find that economic incentives are often the motivation for war. With Hussein ousted, they would not have to form treaties to get Iraq's oil, they could just insert puppet leaders (which they did), who would allow them less restricted access.

5296 2018-10-17 16:09:53 Hmmm...oil and gas are obsolete? Bet you won't be saying that if there's a rise in prices bc of what is going on in Saudi Arabia...then you'll blame a bunch of old guys for not being self efficient...another liberal hypocrite.

5305 2018-10-17 16:09:21 Waste is a small issue at this juncture. It is all currently stored, safely, and does not require immediate attention. If you believe the IPCC report, our oil consumption DOES require immediate attention. Build new reactors and SMR's will deal with the waste in the long term. /2

5307 2018-10-17 16:09:15 My blood pressure is thru the roof today lol never needed so much peppermint oil.
5308 2018-10-17 16:08:51 My new beard oil and balm smells like pine wood and bourbon and I’ve never been happier
5309 2018-10-17 16:08:47 I can't speak on all CBD products, but I'm glad I'm a CTFO customer. Their 300mg peppermint oil got rid of my back pain and allowed me to sleep uninterrupted. #IFeelGood
5310 2018-10-17 16:08:41 Excellent news for oil and gas executives.  But why are we little people paying more at the pump??
5311 2018-10-17 16:08:34 Did Jason speak about our stolen native lands & resources? Or how only Giv & migrant settlers benefit from our royalties? Or@how there’s a direct correlation between Oil/Gas booms & #MMIW? Did he speak about #Treaty how settlers continue to break while getting rich off our land?
5312 2018-10-17 16:08:33 So just how many pieces of silver or gallons of oil is a journalist’s life worth? @realDonaldTrump what say you? PS> Kavanaugh lied under oath. I don’t care what he did in college. He lied! And you chose to ignore that!
5313 2018-10-17 16:08:32 The oil i got my bf make me wanna molest his ass 24/7 
5314 2018-10-17 16:08:32 not going to argue with you ......the dirty oil is natural and its a big clean up project / nice you are into the rare earth elements ...your toxic Chinese green tech and intermittent bird and bat blenders reclassify you as eco terrorists

5317 2018-10-17 16:08:17 After inspection put heavy oil or tar in the engines’ boilers, or put half a kilogram of soft soap into the water in the tender.
5318 2018-10-17 16:08:16 There needs to be student discounts for things like tires, oil changes and gas
5319 2018-10-17 16:08:02 Don’t forget the butter and the MCT oil! 
5320 2018-10-17 16:07:55 I don’t have any oil stocks. But do have huge concerns with our economy being crushed with more taxes. The kind of thing that will crush your and my business. I can pass my extra costs on to consumers, until I have none left.
5321 2018-10-17 16:07:54 Yeah sure, we went in and fucked up the entire Middle East just so some oil companies could temporarily profit. There are far easier ways to get oil. They could have just treated with Hussein for oil - which they were doing up until the war started.
5322 2018-10-17 16:07:53 Saudi Arabia has us by the balls. Can't punish them or they will cut oil supply and skyrockey gas prices. Can't cut arm sales or they'll just buy off of Russia. China owns our debt...
5323 2018-10-17 16:07:53 maybe its the dollar going down instead of oil going up?
5324 2018-10-17 16:07:48 What’s the beef with palm oil?
5325 2018-10-17 16:07:42 Sadly this won't happen. @DoctorCanBob Folks change once they get to @YourAlberta What's imp is @OilGasCanada and the money.But gambling revenues more than oil revenues. Disabled and seniors don't benefit under any political party. @Alberta_UCP @jkenney @Alberta_UCP @UCPCaucus
5326 2018-10-17 16:07:39 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

5328 2018-10-17 16:07:35 These people are animals and absolutely greenlit 9/11 operation. Zero chance Bin Laden had the resources to do that from his cave. Sickening how we allow them to do this stuff because they sit on huge oil wells.
5329 2018-10-17 16:07:33 Important ally strictly for the lube they are providing. I mean the oil.  Really.
5330 2018-10-17 16:07:29 I need to get up and bring my car to get an oil change 
5331 2018-10-17 16:07:23 I hate coming to get an oil change I hate waiting
5332 2018-10-17 16:07:19 Oil.  The pursuit of comfort makes us turn a blind eye to human rights.
5333 2018-10-17 16:07:18 Pipe up you snake oil salesman fruad.
5334 2018-10-17 16:07:15 the powers that be crashed the oil price, that's how I lost my job offshore, the PTB will never let a country use it's resources to help the people, they are there to enrich the super rich. anyone doing so will be smashed, also anyone using debt-free money. Iraq, Libya, Iran etc
5335 2018-10-17 16:07:15 3)Russia already has up to 500kpd swap deal with Iran. Rosneft acquired Essar's oil refinery with 400kpd capacity in India last year. At an event yesterday, it was mentioned that they are planning to direct that oil there.
5336 2018-10-17 16:07:14 @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews decrease oil imports by 25%
5337 2018-10-17 16:07:12 Technology and people power need to work together. Monash needs to divest from Oil & Gas companies now to lead the way and curb the disastrous impacts of climate change. Don't you agree @ecroft?
5338 2018-10-17 16:07:10 Oil
5339 2018-10-17 16:07:06 You can’t even afford an oil change. Try again.
5340 2018-10-17 16:06:54 Why are we supposed to be proud about this. We should be the world's leader in clean energy and the least dependent in oil.
5341 2018-10-17 16:06:53 The firing of staff writers and even podcasters for the snake oil that was "video content" was always a dumb idea. Now it's revealed that the numbers folks were chasing on FB were made up....
5342 2018-10-17 16:06:48 Want pretty skin? Tea. Tree. Oil. 
You're welcome.
5343 2018-10-17 16:06:42 The Saudis are still living in the middle ages. If they didn't have oil, they'd be wandering the desert in their dresses looking for a camel turd to eat.

They shouldn't be coddled, they should be sanctioned, shunned &  bombed for things they've done.

Remember 911 &15 Saudis?
5344 2018-10-17 16:06:36 @U_lovemex3 when will your hair oil be stocked?
5345 2018-10-17 16:06:31 I can see that happening. When I lived in Queens the old owner had the old tank replaced. But he left the old oil tank pipe there. That could have been bad. My Dad and I removed it just in case.
5346 2018-10-17 16:06:31 You do know that our Vice President and President at the time were both either heads of, or heavily associated with, the oil industry, right? The company which Cheney was previously CEO of, Halliburton, profited enormously off of the Iraq debacle.
5347 2018-10-17 16:06:29 Oh o was think trump say russia was not hacken america by the wayyou by oil fron saudi arabia
5348 2018-10-17 16:06:26 Time to get the Americans oil rigs to work and let the Saudis starve for a few years. A majority of our oil comes from Canada. Time to be good neighbors. As for the 110 billion in arms sales I’m sure there’s other buyers like there neighbors.
5349 2018-10-17 16:06:18 Did I ? Rubbed down and waxed a wardrobe today 
Domestic goddess, plumber , carpenter, you name it.
5350 2018-10-17 16:06:13 i like rosehip oil! you have to use it consistently but it works well for me to fade scarring and brighten my skin over all. as for makeup, i like tarte’s shape tape. long lasting and a good formula to cover almost anything. also i wanna remind you that you’re lovely and “flaws”

5353 2018-10-17 16:05:51 I did. John told me a tanker was in. Don't know if there were any earlier .  Nobody was here.
5354 2018-10-17 16:05:43 You are absolutely correct @WickedRayvn  And if the Saudi's hike the price of OIL from $80.00/barrel to $200.00/barrel, we'll be back in the DARK AGES!  All thanks to the IGNORANCE of Foreign Policy by @DennisS04895857 's American Idol, donald tRump!
5355 2018-10-17 16:05:40 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
5356 2018-10-17 16:05:32 If only there was a good reason not to buy tons of oil from countries with no respect for human rights hmm
5357 2018-10-17 16:05:25 Can you quantify or estimate the amount of money private citizens have spent on luxury goods? If some of these citizens had opted to spend their money on business. Small scale manufacturing, cooking oil, soap, cereals etc don't you think that our economy would be better. My point
5358 2018-10-17 16:05:21 And also because, oil.

5366 2018-10-17 16:04:52 Saudis try a new approach to downplay Khashoggi murder...

“How ‘bout we smooth this whole thing over with a few hundred million barrels of oil? C’mon, fill ‘er up! On the house of Fahd!”
5367 2018-10-17 16:04:51 Oh yeah?  Maybe we should invade their country, steal their oil and murder their families—to make them free—just like we did in Iraq.
5368 2018-10-17 16:04:50 Last night I voted a straight Democratic ticket. Not that all I voted for were good, but I despise the GOP, needed to vote no on gas & oil drilling, stop a sales tax increase on the poor to pay for roads for corporations.
5369 2018-10-17 16:04:49 Excellent, that should take care of Doom Spray & Snake Oil pastors.
5370 2018-10-17 16:04:49 Pimento Oil is coming in the mail today. can’t wait to prepoo tonight 
5371 2018-10-17 16:04:49 £100 to £180! Ive got one of them oil cans. #FlogIt
5372 2018-10-17 16:04:44 Also do some research what this payment is for? It is for the regasifying LNG that is imported through FSRU, which is a far cheaper alternative to Diesel and Furnace oil.
5373 2018-10-17 16:04:43 I mean if you are ready to believe the Iraq War was launched solely to keep some moustache-twirling oil company barons happy, you're halfway there with your conspiratorial nonsense.

5377 2018-10-17 16:04:26 How different is this from Bush-Cheney turning a blind eye to Saudi funding of Saudi Bin Laden's Saudi terrorists, which resulted in the 9/11 massacre of 3,000 Americans? When will the GOP put country and common decency above oil and their personal investments in Saudi Arabia?
5378 2018-10-17 16:04:25 The issue is the fact that a) now SDF is a US puppet which will be thrown under the bus for Turkey , and secondly - the US occupy our land and our oil fields (not in Kurdish territory) in dier ez zour so they can prevent us from using our resources for reconstruction
5379 2018-10-17 16:04:21 Between shale oil and Canada, Saudi Arabia is wholly unnecessary as a source of oil to the US. Maybe needed as an ally for other geopolitical reasons but it’s no longer oil.
5380 2018-10-17 16:04:19 “Why????”
Oil.
5381 2018-10-17 16:04:11 This is why President Obama wanted to move the country away from Saudis & Saudi oil. 

White men like Scarborough thought Obama was too dumb & naive to know the Persians were playing him. 

But it was white men like Scarborough who were dumb & naive.

5389 2018-10-17 16:03:23 What does everyone want Trump do with Saudi Arabia? Start a war? Take all of their oil off the market? Put them on economic sanctions? Start a global conflict among the world’s largest oil producers? What?
5390 2018-10-17 16:03:21 And your money comes from big oil, coal, gas companies in wv, pa, etc! She isn't Hillary she just really cares about nevadians!
5391 2018-10-17 16:03:21 #South Korea's decision to cut gasoline taxes is likely to give temporary relief to consumers. The cut would need to extend into 2019 if it is to offset rising global oil prices. EIU expects oil prices to keep rising in 2019.
5392 2018-10-17 16:03:20 I knew someone where the oil delivery came to her house hooked it all up and promptly created an disaster with hundreds of gallons going into her basement. The delivery was for the house next door. Her house was now gas and whatever they did to convert didn’t cap off old plugs
5393 2018-10-17 16:03:17 He went on a simple course that took him into CNC operation ! No university at all. He is now 40 and he is the shop cnc manager making parts for north sea oil. Even today his mental arithmetic gives him the edge over other operators. He earns 38,000 pounds a year,
5394 2018-10-17 16:03:12 Time for open tryouts at Lucas Oil. #ColtsNation
5395 2018-10-17 16:03:11 No one in his right mind actually believes that oil is comprised of decomposed plants. The proof that the earth itself creates oil is under the oceans where 10s of 1,000s of fissures leak oil into the seas every second which the movement of the tides disperses. #CommonSense

@GEOWASHAXE
5404 2018-10-17 16:02:16 Might want to think twice about that. President Trump is not Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama. He will kick your ass, then take your oil to pay for our effort. If you doubt me, just ask Qaddafi's descendants what Ronald Reagan did to him.

5408 2018-10-17 16:02:07 The only problem the Indian Nation's have is the same problem that all other's have. Poor leadership, corruption, fraud, mismanagement and greed. Shale oil and gas are our springboard into the future. Figgin frac it. Drill baby drill.
5409 2018-10-17 16:02:07 It's been...christ, over ten years since I last vaped, so pardon the dumb question. Still less smoke if you use flowers? Or is it all oil vaping now?
5410 2018-10-17 16:02:05 Pro tip I learned for pan-cooking eggs: heat oil/butter mixture at medium-high to high (depending on pan). As soon as the eggs hit the pan, drop heat to medium-low to low (again, depending on the pan).
5411 2018-10-17 16:02:01 Saw 2day how one can be in a store, it’s calm, short lines, people going about their business, then shop workers bring out some  cooking oil, Mazoe juice (goods in short supply), the sudden influx of shoppers, the arguments as shoppers try to grab scarce commodities #Zimbabwe
5412 2018-10-17 16:02:01 You make a good point, however, enough of anything can kill you, olive oil, garlic, and, yes, fluoride. However; the lethal dose of sodium fluoride is 5mg per kg. The average weight of a 2 year old is about 12.5kg. Meaning it would take a little over 60mg of fluoride ingested...
5413 2018-10-17 16:01:57 $50 on a oil change 
5414 2018-10-17 16:01:48 The reason the callous Tories refuse to criticise the Sadistic Saudi Regime is simple:

5415 2018-10-17 16:01:47 Let's all join the race to the bottom then! While we're at it, let's start pumping oil DIRECTLY into the ocean, that way we can speed up the death of all living beings in the ocean too! I love doing nothing but I love actively working against progress better ;)
5416 2018-10-17 16:01:47 When will the minister declare dovi and cooking oil 1:1 meat and mushroom also 1:1 to save us from this scarce commodities

5420 2018-10-17 16:01:36 I did some math and got resulting mixture temperature of 135.61 deg. C from liquid NaOH at 323 deg. C and oil at 30 deg. C in 1:1 ratio by weight. Enthalpies of NaOH fusion and polymorphic transition taken into account in addition to thermal capacities.

5422 2018-10-17 16:01:31 I have four children and the $670 you give us for unemployment barely covers essentials such as food. Not to mention I need oil, and wood to heat my house too. With bills piling up, and Christmas coming fast I feel hopeless today.

5424 2018-10-17 16:01:27 For someone who apparently races on a race track I would have thought you may understand that accurate measurements are vital. Tyre pressures, oil temperatures, brake force etc. If you measure those inaccurately youd be screwed. Why is it different for speed measurement?
5425 2018-10-17 16:01:27 Please and please,  I need  some one  to tell me that am dreaming  and this shit is not real, please
5426 2018-10-17 16:01:25 Vape pens have no smell. Also CBD oil with some THC might help you out with chronic pain as well. Some get help from CBD alone.

5428 2018-10-17 16:01:24  like Karnel Oil

5430 2018-10-17 16:01:17 Cannabis /hemp has been banned since 1937. By Pharma, Oil companies, and bankers. Who got politicians to enact laws to ban same. Up to 1937 and the thousands of years before that, going back before the bible. There was never any crimes, deaths, or abuse of cannabis /hemp.
5431 2018-10-17 16:01:15 We don't need the Saudis! Only 11% of our oil now comes from them.
5432 2018-10-17 16:01:12 So these questions need an answer: to all those producing oil; what’s your plan when it runs dry? To all those fishing the oceans; what’s your plan when they r gone? To all those polluting the lands; what’s your plan when they r ruined? If u can’t answer them #mankind is doomed
5433 2018-10-17 16:01:11 Welp my estimates were pretty accurate. Needs a new alternator and apparently everything else with my car looked good, needs a new cabin air filter though and with the oil change. With my AAA discount $679 dollars. Goodbye money! Thankfully if my alternator did any damage to my
5434 2018-10-17 16:01:06 Your problem is that none of that is happening. 

The oil companies have the big money. Not universities. 

Climate scientists have rejected bad science. That’s what they’re supposed to do. 

We understand the physical world fairly well, and it doesn’t change to suit your wishes.
5435 2018-10-17 16:01:04 Neoliberalism is a market philosophy which revives liberal laissez-faire ideologies and therefore seeks to dissolve market controls, leading to concentration of private power. The Iraq War was largely waged for the benefit of oil companies and contractors.

Wondering if anyone has any experience with CBD oil? I have been on several different anxiety medications without any luck. Prozac and Zoloft didn’t really help, and lexapro made my anxiety worse.
5442 2018-10-17 16:00:36 Engro is being paid for regasifying gas using LNG, which is a far cheaper alternative to producing gas through Diesel and Furnace oil.

5454 2018-10-17 15:59:55 Luke, I used to manage IPE (now ICEEurope) ARA physical oil product deliveries for a living. Logistical constraints limit physical deliveries, which typically take place as a last resort, either for quality reasons or credit reasons (ie crap teapot credit quality) #OOTT
5455 2018-10-17 15:59:54 Ryan Zinke and Trump, along with several state governors have deliberately been destroying our National Parks for oil money.
5456 2018-10-17 15:59:51 Obama's Iranian buddies are killing Yemeni school children with the blessing of Yemen's government.
It's a little early to know exactly what the US govt under Trump intends to do about the Saudis. Are you advocating for immediate bombing? Cut off Saudi oil imports? Stern words?
5457 2018-10-17 15:59:41 Stronger Rand , stronger Brent crude oil price , will we see the decline in petrol price or is the call too soon ?

5463 2018-10-17 15:59:17 In retrospect I’m glad I went to bed so early cause I’m gonna be stuck getting my oil change for so long.
5464 2018-10-17 15:59:11 Tax cuts, oil, and because Saudi Arabia is killing people in Yemen.
5465 2018-10-17 15:59:10 Millions of Americans wish they could be as entitled as Mitch McConnell who has stolen from the American people by voting against them in HC and basic human rights while lining his pockets with oil and gas money, super pacs, the NRA and Russian mob money.

5467 2018-10-17 15:59:07 Why is Corbyn so anti worker, anti jobs and so pro anyone who complains about anything? In America 10's of thousands of jobs have been created in the fracking industry at no cost to the environment. In fact the recovered gas is better for the environment than anything oil based.
5468 2018-10-17 15:58:59 Oil sucks either way, need to go to electronic cars.
5469 2018-10-17 15:58:58 It's not anti-anything. It's pro environment and economy. Instead of putting our eggs in a basket of dirty tar sands oil lets invest in renewable energy jobs that would create far better results for the economy and the environment.

5473 2018-10-17 15:58:40 I prefer smooth but not not the generic crappy stuff you get at the supermarket.  I only buy the good stuff.  Unsalted, no sugar added, non gmo.  When you open the lid you should see some oil at the top.  That is the sign of the good stuff.
5474 2018-10-17 15:58:27 Thanks for checking out my website! Clean technologies will grow in absence of a price on carbon, but it'll certainly help them grow faster. How have your oil stocks done over the past 5 years?
5475 2018-10-17 15:58:27 England is better together,,scots lose 92% of their own oil revenues.
Do you think England would ever accept a deal like it gives scot`s?
5476 2018-10-17 15:58:21 You are one of the largest oil producers in the world now. You can buy all the oil you want from us (Canada) as well. 

The oil strategy must change. Drain the Middle East then using our stores is not necessary anymore.

5479 2018-10-17 15:57:51 @BeckyCNN I am British born in Iraq wonder why on earth the west think that Saudi Arabia is the only oil producer and the west and USA terrified in case the Saudis cut down their production?? how about the forgotten Iraq? Iraq's oil reserve is more than the Saudi, why not IRAQ

Goat chops are immense when marinated in quality olive oil, garlic & thyme & char grilled
5483 2018-10-17 15:57:32 I tried the (legal) and most recommended brand of CBD oil and all I got was a bad taste in my mouth, hehe.
5484 2018-10-17 15:57:19 The biggest difference between the two to this point: winning.  Crosby has basically won everything there is to win.  That being said, it almost makes some of 97's accomplishments stand out more because the Oil have lacked any consistency around him whatsoever.
5485 2018-10-17 15:57:07 I’ve got the CBD oil and haven’t used it yet, anyone have any tips on how much to take or best way to take it?
5486 2018-10-17 15:57:07 Elias accidentally struck green and gold oil with that one, lol
5487 2018-10-17 15:57:06 Even when oil prices going up..He waited for 1 long month before bringing down the prices
5488 2018-10-17 15:57:05 @realDonaldTrump This is actually a truly rotten and horrible thing.  Being the largest producer of solar, wind and tidal power is something to brag about, not oil and gas.  @POTUS's stupidity is a bottomless pit--no sign of intelligence anywhere, never stops! sad!

5493 2018-10-17 15:56:49 How about you both be Skeletons because the water you have been drinking contains oil from pipelines and it’s killed you both.
5494 2018-10-17 15:56:35 I denied nothing about evidence you presented. My tweets asserted the evidence was meaningless if debating: Resolved KSA can't threaten because even 73 oil embargo had little effect & EPA caused those gas lines. I explained my logic. The Dr. doth protest too much, methinks. 
5495 2018-10-17 15:56:33 Other oil suppliers are available to the US. We do not need Saudi Arabia, part of Trump’s new Axis of Evil.
5496 2018-10-17 15:56:33 Yeah because Saudi Arabia doesn’t violate human rights, so let’s defend them. How about never and if we had independence from oil neither would matter.
5497 2018-10-17 15:56:29 Sweet oil.
5498 2018-10-17 15:56:25 Well done that girl
5499 2018-10-17 15:56:23 Bunch of old guys excited about a dying industry. Its like advertising for the Pony Express after the telegraph exists. Being the largest Oil and gas producer is nothing to be proud of.

5503 2018-10-17 15:56:11 Why do you see self gov for scots as separatism?
M has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years and still near bankrupted the UK.
Why should scots stay with that?

5507 2018-10-17 15:56:06 So you no longer use cooking oil? 
5508 2018-10-17 15:56:02 Is it normal to cry while watching the Dawn commercials where they clean the oil off of the ducklings and otter

Asking for me
5509 2018-10-17 15:56:01 I was told the Brits failed to market the electric car because they couldn’t figure out how to make it leak oil
5510 2018-10-17 15:55:55 Personally I 've stopped chasing after cooking oil, I will just do with alternatives. The day everything finishes case closed. The situation is not getting any better soon. The sooner we accept tha better.

5514 2018-10-17 15:55:35 I drove 2,500 miles moving out to SF years ago and only when I had basically arrived did my oil pump die

5529 2018-10-17 15:54:30 Today’s oil inv snapshot impacted by Hurricane Michael as crude exports declined almost twice as much as prod declined resulting in crude build. Not as bearish as headline numbers portray @DTNOilandGas @DtnTrading

5531 2018-10-17 15:54:28 Well explain why Arab oil producing nations sell gas to their citizens at wholesale?
5532 2018-10-17 15:54:09 President Trump  is delivering real results: America is now the largest oil producer on the face of the planet.
5533 2018-10-17 15:53:46 Dude since when is anybody the boss of the Saudis. Who's going to buy the oil if we don't. NATO burns up billions of gallons every year flying in circles driving in circles. How much opium flows down opium road now. Answer enough to keep America stoned and stupid.
5534 2018-10-17 15:53:44 You only need to google "famine in #Yemen" to know how little Western allies to Saudi Arabia actually care about human life. I highly doubt that the murder of #JamalKhashoggi would be any kind of breaking point for that special relationship when arms, oil and money is at stake.

5544 2018-10-17 15:53:23 Olive oil man c’mon
5545 2018-10-17 15:53:20 It’s the opposite, Saudi Arabia needs Iran oil production to shut down so they can control oil prices. Trump needs the Saudis - we don’t!

5547 2018-10-17 15:53:18 Don't boycott Saudi Oil though. Taking a bones saw to a living man isn't disgusting.

5549 2018-10-17 15:53:10 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi. Osama bin Laden was Saudi- why are we NOT putting Saudi Arabia on as our “Axis of Evil?” One word: Oil
5550 2018-10-17 15:52:49 1) Those waivers have been the horizon for a while, especially for India. It is obvious the loss of Iranian exports will come from Europe, Japan, and S. Korea. China said it wouldn't increase its oil imports from Iran but ramped it up to almost 800kbpd and wants to use it as base
5551 2018-10-17 15:52:47 Gpp kok  aku juga pake baby oil
5552 2018-10-17 15:52:46 Wait, WHAT??? This is so terrible. I live in a state in the USA where cannabis is illegal but CBD oil is allowed because like you said it helps with illnesses and doesn't get you high what the actual fuck? No reason for it to be illegal like at ALL.

5554 2018-10-17 15:52:44 And?????   Do you know how many business men do business in Saudi?   Then hold all oil men accountable too.  Again!!  Why is it Trumps fault this guy was killed?   You can’t answer that can you.  All you can do is reach to see why he isn’t handling it better.  Never enough!
5555 2018-10-17 15:52:43 If we didn't buy their oil what would they do then?
Iran has lots of cheap oil and if we ignore the Trumper and deal with Iran the Saudis would suffer.
5556 2018-10-17 15:52:40 Prob saving the gold one for the 50th :)
5557 2018-10-17 15:52:39 Our current strategy is clearly not working out and why should we pick the guys with more oil?
5558 2018-10-17 15:52:38 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
5559 2018-10-17 15:52:37 Why is gas so expensive then?   #oil #gas
5560 2018-10-17 15:52:33 Why should we que for ordinary cooking oil its now or never
5561 2018-10-17 15:52:28 Four essential oils to follow:
1 - #CBDoil #MedicalMarijuana $GWPH $CGC etc.
2 - #FishOil $AMRN
3 - #LightSweetCrude $USO
4 - #Musk oil $TSLA
5562 2018-10-17 15:52:27 The world is funny, because if the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard, it's government property. But if they find drugs, it's yours.
5563 2018-10-17 15:52:23 Also, what can be done to help train Colorado’s workforce, such that anyone who may lose their job in oil and gas is qualified to take a job in renewables? If they’re willing, that is.

5567 2018-10-17 15:52:13 The current biggest issue in my life is that I want to listen to a YouTube concert while scrolling Twitter and can't do both. 

Also my car is burning oil but

5569 2018-10-17 15:52:07 Yet he yells at canada, Venezuela and mexico all the time. It’s more then just the oil we buy  from them.
5570 2018-10-17 15:51:56 Castor oil.
5571 2018-10-17 15:51:47 He's a tea party hack. What did you expect?z He is owned by the Koch brothers who don't want to interrupt the Saudi oil supply.
5572 2018-10-17 15:51:31 I could watch a million hours of footage of Olive Oil production.
5573 2018-10-17 15:51:29 A few of Frank Reich's old teammates from his Bills days will be at Lucas Oil Stadium for the game Sunday, sounds like Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, maybe more. Says a lot about what they think of Reich.
5574 2018-10-17 15:51:26 It’s supposed to be brown in color, nope they need to go back to the oil
5575 2018-10-17 15:51:22 If we are producing enough fuel why do we have to be so nice to Saudi Arabia who only has their oil to be proud of. We should get to the bottom of the murder of Mr Kashoggi
5576 2018-10-17 15:51:20 Jab $30-40 oil mil raha tha tab hamari modi sarkar ne #StrategicPeteroleumReserve kyu nahi badhaya?

5577 2018-10-17 15:51:20 sadly for me, edibles don't have any effect on me, my digestive system sucks. Thankfully the oil under the tongue 2 minutes work but doesn't get me very high. A joint gets me higher.
5578 2018-10-17 15:51:12 Yeah oil changes are hella expensive on BMWs, the 4 series is a hella fun car tho
5579 2018-10-17 15:50:56 It was overdue. It helped modi to divert the people from Economic & Oil disaster.
5580 2018-10-17 15:50:50 You're allowing him to do that because you probably went forward to buy that over priced cooking oil.
5581 2018-10-17 15:50:47 9-11....most of the terrorists were Saudi..using money from the Saudi princess.  They are not our allies.  We are their oil slaves.
5582 2018-10-17 15:50:45 body oil is super important during this time of year
5583 2018-10-17 15:50:43 News Media/Democrats - yes, they're one-in-the-same - W-A-N-T an Oil War and economic chaos before the midterms.
5584 2018-10-17 15:50:42 Still clinging on to Scotland. Billions of barrels of oil still to be stolen.
5585 2018-10-17 15:50:41 Many in rural areas rely on oil for heating, sitting at 60p ltr. Means filling tank will cost £700. Beyond means of many elderly #heat or eat 
5586 2018-10-17 15:50:36 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
5587 2018-10-17 15:50:35 Well pick my nose with an elephant's tusk! My old van that's that's not moved for 17 years still rolls after all 4 flat tyres inflated and held their pressure. I wouldn't be surprised now if the engine still runs but needs oil change, oil filter and air filter change first. #wow

5593 2018-10-17 15:50:14 Anything to make sure the Saudis keep the oil flowing and at a low price, and to keep buying more US weapons. What is 1 life compared to the $100million in projected weapons sale. At least that’s Trump’s calculus of the situation.
5594 2018-10-17 15:50:12 I really think its that oil
5595 2018-10-17 15:50:11 I don't understand why the US looks the other way at Saudi Arabia's abuses. It's both parties. Do we really need the oil that bad? I suspect it has more to do w/Saudi bribes/influence in DC & the secret intelligence operations that SA & the US do together in the Middle East.

5597 2018-10-17 15:49:57 If only there was a good reason not to buy tons of oil from countries with no respect for human rights hmm
5598 2018-10-17 15:49:50 They will continue to provide cover to the real terrorist, they are after all responsible for bringing down the World Trade Center & attacking the Pentagon who knows where the 4th plane was heading, the next big terrorist attack will likely be financed by Saudi oil money.
5599 2018-10-17 15:49:39 てかデレステより判定キツくない？
5600 2018-10-17 15:49:38 yeah for real like i don’t even use it everyday she just recommended it when oily bc some of my products can cause oil overproduction and it helps soooo
5601 2018-10-17 15:49:35 Doesn’t make any sense does it? Something isn’t adding up. Here we are touting about being the biggest oil and gas producer and the REST OF THE WORLD is moving toward cleaner, renewable energy. We are going backwards
5602 2018-10-17 15:49:16 So much of the geopolitical bind we're in with Saudi Arabia is rooted in our addiction to oil. Just saying. #climate #Khashoggi

5606 2018-10-17 15:49:14 Light weight cars are excellent candidates for being converted from gas burners to all electric. And it is possible and cheaper for us to build our own battery banks with power equivalent to Tesla Motors' car batteries. It''s one way to stop big oil & gas.
5607 2018-10-17 15:49:08 thank you oil, super love you. Thank you kasi nagpunta ka kanina, yie!
5608 2018-10-17 15:49:06 oil is finished, gas and geothermal much better
5609 2018-10-17 15:49:00 Because he disagrees with you on one point? Then don’t drive a car that uses gas either since Saudi Arabian and Venezuelan oil are 2 of our top import suppliers.

5613 2018-10-17 15:48:51 FYI we justify murder for convenience every day. Unless you’re only buying free trade products and nothing from any countries that under pay their employees who work in horrifying conditions... also, we as a country have justified unnecessary murder for oil & military advantage.
5614 2018-10-17 15:48:46 Most of the Planet worships the American Dollar and Oil.
5615 2018-10-17 15:48:45 Jonah needs coffee to function, just like car needs motor oil.
5616 2018-10-17 15:48:40 why are we bragging about oil and gas in 2018?
Especialy when other countries are almost entirly run on wind and solar?

It's like braging about winning a company kickball game when your neighbors are World Cup champions
5617 2018-10-17 15:48:40 @XtremeScreams not impressed with the food this year.. the fish and chips were just oil and doughnuts weren’t cooked! #screampark #halloween

5630 2018-10-17 15:48:01 Saudi's likely funded 9/11, do you think we will do anything about one person being killed?  Its very clear from the current and prior administrations that the dollar and oil take precedence over human rights.
5631 2018-10-17 15:48:00 Try thc oil 
5632 2018-10-17 15:47:58 racism, selling snake oil & grifting is not innovative.

5635 2018-10-17 15:47:51 Is there a list of products that contain palm oil published anywhere? I’d love to shop with knowledge..
5636 2018-10-17 15:47:51 Gold diggers they'll dig you, until they find oil.

5639 2018-10-17 15:47:31 Awesome. Because we can survive on domestic oil, coal, and natural gas while more sustainable energy is perfected to be more efficient, and cost effective. Smaller, more affordable solar batteries are required to make widescale use a reality for individual homes.
5640 2018-10-17 15:47:29 When unionists tell you the oil is the UK`s.
ask them who they hid the McCrone report from then?
Did they hide it from themselves?
5641 2018-10-17 15:47:25 I made some wonderful moisturizing and beautifully intentioned body oil and facial oil yesterday. My skin feels amaze and I feel so rejuvenated and ready for anything.
5642 2018-10-17 15:47:19 What specically would you do or mean by coming down hard?  Considering all facts..and of course OIL.OIL..$$...Like to know your specific thoughts..
5643 2018-10-17 15:47:11 i woke up in the middle the night
i massaged olive oil into my body
the moon shone beneath my feet, illuminating the discontent in my face.
I caught it just in time to find the sun waiting outside the door.

it brought truth.

5647 2018-10-17 15:46:54 if you use keratin: it’s made from horns, claws and hooves from animals!!!! Try using raw avocado, bananas, olive oil and coconut oil if you need moisture in your hair and skin!
5648 2018-10-17 15:46:52 Doing a simple sublimation using an oil bath. Hotplate setting =1; temp 40 oC, Hotplate setting = 1.5; temp 60 oC, Hotplate setting = 2; temp 180 oC. The pagan gods of chemistry have an odd, if exponential, sense of humour. Clear example of Oakley Thermal Crapping (OTC).
5649 2018-10-17 15:46:49 Try applying coconut oil during a seriously hot shower. The pores open up with steam, and allow the oil to really seep in and help the skin. After your shower use aloe or shea butter based lotion, and then immediately apply cold water to the skin. This closes up the pores.
5650 2018-10-17 15:46:45 i did my "finances" (cool word for money i heard from an oil tycoon) in a similar way this year. breakdown solidarity pal <3
5651 2018-10-17 15:46:40 It's totally horrible that government is giving to much excuse on the oil prices...if govt has a willpower to cut the price of oil then they can do that although consumer is accepted the higher  price when the oil price very low now it turn of the government.....
5652 2018-10-17 15:46:39 힘들다
5653 2018-10-17 15:46:35 Gun oil, ma'am.
5654 2018-10-17 15:46:28 Yes! Capsules and oil.
5655 2018-10-17 15:46:21 Absolutely! A tonne more like that simple tomato sauce recipe, and of course it's not all pasta. I've tried dozens of her recipes and they're all winners.

Just ignore whenever she says vegetable oil. Times have changed and olive oil is easy to come by (healthier/tastier too).
5656 2018-10-17 15:46:19 Also a little disappointed that I can't seem to find any CBD oil with no THC in it at the BC Weed Store.
5657 2018-10-17 15:46:11 The new fish oil gel caps I bought have been making my burps taste like a dried up creek. I am so unhappy right now.
5658 2018-10-17 15:46:09 Could you make the Rystad Energy's table -you publish on 07/10/2017- below of proved reserves in a time series say from 1975 up today, some 45 years so we can see the behavior over time of these oil reserves? It is the only way to get the picture in the future medium-term?
5659 2018-10-17 15:46:08 Came at the perfect time to get my oil changed 
5660 2018-10-17 15:46:07 I need 4 tires , alignment,oil change, and brakes

5662 2018-10-17 15:45:53 @HondaCustSvc @GarciaHondaNM claims they've never heard of oil dilution. Are they lying or woefully uninformed about 350,000 recalls and a stop sale order in China?

5670 2018-10-17 15:45:25 What was the inspiration for your invention?

Elon Musk: To make the world independent of oil.

Mark Zuckerberg: To exact revenge on girls who wouldn't date us.
5671 2018-10-17 15:45:21 Move to a city that better suits your needs! There are good jobs! High paying. Oil fields are hiring, all levels.. Check railroad for entry level. UPS is hiring.
5672 2018-10-17 15:45:15 We need investment in engineering to produce green energy which would solve the oil and employment issues, but that would take governmental leadership

5685 2018-10-17 15:44:31 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia's prince killed this guy STOP THE GUN SALES AND SALES OF OUR OIL AND DON'T BUY FROM THEM this is Sept 11 again
5686 2018-10-17 15:44:27 @cnni Kashoggi murder will go unpunished despite all the evidence. If USA and Europe tried sanctions against SA then they could turn off the oil and watch our economies collapse as retribution. Trump would never upset SA too much money involved. The morals of politics are horrid.

Peak oil. Petrol dollar @GOP money laundering to keep the currency from defaulting. The dollar is defaulted
5691 2018-10-17 15:43:59 A warning has been given of what could happen if the USA sanctions Saudi  that Saudi could allow Russia to establish a base at Tabuk and linking Saudi oil to the yen and realign weapons deals to Russia & China  (source TRT world)
5692 2018-10-17 15:43:58 So we let them continue to be corrupt as long as the cash and oil keep coming. Got it.
5693 2018-10-17 15:43:53 So he is standing in front of a moving train or joining the moving train. No one likes to be left behind. The days of the elite milking us is over. No more rent seeking thieves. We tax their jets, revoke their oil licenses, tax their ppty abroad.
5694 2018-10-17 15:43:45 API reports massive draw; EIA reports massive build; oil swings all over the place; someone is making money out of this. #OOTT
5695 2018-10-17 15:43:37 If the world never needed another drop of oil, these Saudi freaks would evaporate very quickly. We need to evolve. We need to see wicked evil regimes for the degradation they are.
5696 2018-10-17 15:43:36 I think I want that cannabis sativa, black castor, and olive oil eco gel.
5697 2018-10-17 15:43:25 Just paid $446 dollars for 150 gallons of oil that will MAYBE last us 6 weeks. This is when adulting makes you cringe

Tous sont beaux mais olive oil est superbe !
5701 2018-10-17 15:42:52 Looks like you’ve struck oil.
5702 2018-10-17 15:42:51 Nowww I see why yo don’t like oil changes. I pay normally $38 for one with a synthetic blend. This place just said $71 dollars!

5706 2018-10-17 15:42:30 Bruh i just remembered I left $20 in my car while getting an oil change.... let’s see if it’s there
5707 2018-10-17 15:42:25 Our national interest has always really been in promoting real democracy, but so-called realists held sway. Now, it’s hard to deny we need to sweep out corrupt autocrats and oligarchy. End  weaponizing internet, govt hacking, get agreements to stop climate change. Trees, not oil.
5708 2018-10-17 15:42:21 This should be the END of our relationship with these freaking butchers. We made them rich with oil money, they nurtured terrorists who flew planes into WTC, and now they murder a journalist and dismember him. These people are barbarians. Their denials are a joke. ENOUGH.
5709 2018-10-17 15:42:20 @Varneyco Playing hookey this morning watching Varney in the White House! Not only do I see our President, oil comes down under $70! Self employment perk!
Great show!
5710 2018-10-17 15:42:13 The Saudis have been US allies since WWII ... it was through this relationship that FDR issued an oil embargo on Japan leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor that convinced the US to enter the war killing 500,000 Americans.
Democrats - destroying the country since the Civil War.
5711 2018-10-17 15:42:12 Plastic wrapping and engine oil. What else did you expect to be filling my brain?
5712 2018-10-17 15:42:10 Hennessy smells like an oil change to me.
5713 2018-10-17 15:42:08 It was explained to you that in the north they tend to use lard while in the South they use olive oil :-)
5714 2018-10-17 15:41:49 I believe it is a crow that fell into an oil spill ... just clean him up with some rubbing alcohol and some cotton swabs and he'll be fine ...

5718 2018-10-17 15:41:05 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
5719 2018-10-17 15:41:05 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5720 2018-10-17 15:41:01 Hey folks, largest oil and gas producer on the planet is NOTHING to write home about!  A little out of touch, huh?
5721 2018-10-17 15:40:57 kitty litter for traction in the winter, make sure you have jumper cables and spare oil in that bitch. hella water bottles, blankets and shit 
5722 2018-10-17 15:40:52 #GreatSaudi  needed to stabilize the oil markets,  needed in the war on terror,  needed to confront Iran and its militias, & needed to secure international waters.

5724 2018-10-17 15:40:48 The largest oil producer??? eh? Then why can't we control our own prices??? We should be rich! Rich I tell 'ya.

Big Oil & denies climate change

Big Pharma & doesn't want Medicare to negotiate w/ drug companies

5728 2018-10-17 15:40:34 working as planned - a big part of the us making its peace with higher oil prices after 1973 was realizing that a lot of that money would end up invested in the world's financial center. conveniently right as the Nixon/Ford admins ended controls on foreign capital

5730 2018-10-17 15:40:21 Tea tree oil! It works
5731 2018-10-17 15:40:18 Iran produced  5% of the world's oil in 2017.  Saudi Arabia produced 13% of the world's oil (although it only accounted for 9% of US imports and 4.8% of US consumption).

5733 2018-10-17 15:40:08 WHL about the same size as Lucas Oil in Indy. Wembley just too big.

5738 2018-10-17 15:39:44 Beto O'Rourke encourages the development of alternative energy sources IN CONCERT WITH oil/natural gas. Why twist the truth? Oh. I forgot. You're a former Cruz shill and Trump apologist. That's why the frenzied flurry of Cruz support tweets following his loss of the TX debate.
5739 2018-10-17 15:39:42 Extreme wahabbism is exactly the problem! But with trump it’s all about the money so extreme capitalism (profits from oil being more important than human rights) is as guilty and evil!
5740 2018-10-17 15:39:41 Because we're generally idiots who waste water, & would waste even more without restrictions in place. The last prolonged drought ended way way back in 2015. Next major one will be here before you know it. Like people who bought gas guzzlers as soon as the Arab Oil Crisis "ended"

5744 2018-10-17 15:39:15 I also support the pipeline alternative to oil trains. What I don't support is people who categorize anyone exercising their free-speech rights as a mob. You are so wrong and out of touch about so much that you have no chance of succeeding in this election.

5749 2018-10-17 15:38:52 Why do so many still believe that the west's & specifically the US relationship with the KSA is about arms sales & oil? It's not, it's about the #USD. Having the world's reserve currency brings enormous power. Without the KSA, the dollar goes bye bye.
5750 2018-10-17 15:38:46 All can be purchased outside the EU at the same time helping poorer countries. Why not try Palestinian olive oil?
5751 2018-10-17 15:38:26 What would you have him do? If you were president, what would you do.? Instead of snarky comments, put  out solutions. Don’t think we should start a war over this (they could flood the market with oil or turn to the Russians) both would gravely hurt our country in the long run

Another Laughing Request of Modi is that India should be permitted to pay the Crude Oil Import Bill in Indian Rupee. Modi is living in a Utopian World. US Dollar is the World Accepted Currency
5757 2018-10-17 15:38:02 We are a net oil exporter, and don’t absolutely NEED Saudi oil. Oh, and I do ride a bike—an E-bike, which makes biking possible for this old man. I ride it for fun and exercise, not as primary transportation. Life in Texas isn’t possible without the internal combustion engine.

5761 2018-10-17 15:37:30 The only thing I’d buy from a physical store, if they have it, is hash or oil. That seems to be harder to find than it used to be.
5762 2018-10-17 15:37:18 I get that they want to keep selling oil and gas. What I don’t get is, why not spend the $10 million on CO2 sequestration tech development instead?
5763 2018-10-17 15:37:12 The more I read about the murder of Khashoggi, the more I cannot believe what our government stands for. Blood for oil is too simplistic. It's blood for all kinds of money - the President, Hollywood, Silicon Valley...And Big Bird retiring trends instead of a hit.
5764 2018-10-17 15:37:10 Texas Hill Country is under water today. Lake Travis at 130% & rising. Once-in-a-century rains in Llano. Yet so many Texans remain unconvinced of #ClimateBreakdown & the oil industry wants to Build the Wall - a sea wall to protect Houston-area refineries from rising gulf waters.
5765 2018-10-17 15:37:09 The Saudis represent generations of exceedingly greedy, atavistic murderers. If they hadn't been sitting on oil, they would have been nothing more than primitive bedouins. WWII brought the vile Nazis who infected their minds with the virus of antisemitism & conspiracy fantasies.

5767 2018-10-17 15:36:59 No, of course not. But perhaps you should start pointing out that MBS and SA blood money flows to US politicians, PACs, etc. So those who accept SA money are complicit and have the same blood on their hands. Blood diamonds, blood oil comes to mind.
5768 2018-10-17 15:36:59 Out to change the oil in my Plymouth Horizon... Will be back if my car survives...
5769 2018-10-17 15:36:50 @BetoORourke have you been reading the articles about climate change? it's not a "false choice" between oil and renewables - it's, we stop emissions, or we die.
5770 2018-10-17 15:36:35 i get a similar problem in the afternoons at work, have a real fatigue slump at about 2/3pm. i tend to handle it by having a coffee and sitting down for somewhere that isn't work for twenty mins or so where i can just let my face and body relax. magnesium oil is good for days w

5775 2018-10-17 15:36:18 "They sell oil and buy weapons, that's it."
Frustrated by otherwise responsible individuals, choosing to make statements I hope they know are false, in an effort to be brief. There is a lot more the West needs KSA for than oil & weapons purchases.

5778 2018-10-17 15:36:00 Sadly it is the appalling mismanagement that has caused the issues in Venezuela. A nation that has the largest oil reserves in the world is not in poo because of capitalism or socialism; it is because Maduro and his pals are ignorant and lead a corrupt, repressive regime.

5781 2018-10-17 15:35:51 My skin usually dries out after cleansing, so I use Luxe hip oil as a moisturizer rn. Also have dark spots...(lemon brightening is helping though)
5782 2018-10-17 15:35:49 Right on. It's avocado oil, coconut oil, or butter for cooking in this house.

5786 2018-10-17 15:35:45 Or alternatively, @realDonaldTrump Science doesn't give a fuck what you believe in. It's based on data and facts. Even the oil companies have now admitted they believe humans are causing it. It's not just going to fix itself.
5787 2018-10-17 15:35:42 Yes, we know but love those commercials.  I even got one of those oil cans bee-yahz (beers in an aussie voice)

5802 2018-10-17 15:34:54 I'm still a bit skeptical abt MSM calling this a late cycle move or possibly the top. Typically we see inflation-related moves like EMs soaring along with rise in metals. At this point even oil is having a tuff time holding a 7-handle 
5803 2018-10-17 15:34:53 Great news, bring the oil with you 
5804 2018-10-17 15:34:49 We do know who this guy was. All of us should be able to enter where we choose and be assured we can exit in one piece. Saudi Arabia provided most of the 9/11 highjackers.

5809 2018-10-17 15:34:23 Of course he won’t say anything, the White House has decided we can’t lose Saudi support, as our money, oil, and debts are tied to them—sorry, Turkey, they no longer care #VoteNovember6th

5812 2018-10-17 15:34:09 “CBD” is what you want if you have pain. It doesn’t do much to you mentally, and it’s more expensive, but that’s what people go for when they want the medication without the high.

Careful with recreational oil though. If you’ve never had it it’ll knock you on your butt.

5816 2018-10-17 15:33:47 What do Mohammed bin Salman and Vladimir Putin have in common? Lots of oil, the conviction that they are their countries’ saviors and a tendency to jail or kill their opponents. And our president’s undying support. #DonaldTrump #JamalKashoggi #MBS #Putin

6. Now he is conducting a meeting to force the OIl Producing Countries to reduce the price of Crude Oil. It is just an attempt to be laughed at. Crude Oil Price is dependant upon the Production & Demand
5832 2018-10-17 15:32:48 What are the rules surrounding getting hemp derived CBD oil with less than 0.03% THC /300ml bottle? Still considered illegal to get shipped from out of the country?
5833 2018-10-17 15:32:42 If I can make a genuinely good case as to why xrp isn't a security of ripple (the oil analogy) then ripples lawyers would drop bombs in court if it came to it.
5834 2018-10-17 15:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
5835 2018-10-17 15:32:25 @RTEToday Legalise cannabis in this country for health reasons. Even cannabis oil can help cancer sufferers. The government most allow this.
5836 2018-10-17 15:32:25 Why all the focus on this. Isn’t there bigger stories linked to our failing economy like no pipelines to move our oil.
5837 2018-10-17 15:32:19 Oil prices may seek a hike, yet again
5838 2018-10-17 15:32:16 I been saying this for a long time now. Either pepper or hot oil

5845 2018-10-17 15:31:24 In my experience cbd makes for a better parent. Calmer, less reactive. Start low dose but I find 10mg a day a good place to start. I take 40 mg in oil a day divided into 2 doses. Life long anxiety is gone (I’m 68!)

5847 2018-10-17 15:31:22 Oil price spike = Gas price increase = Renewable energy demand increase = Electric Vehicles demand surge = Stock prices of all of them rise.
5848 2018-10-17 15:31:22 People know Saudi Arabia is a member of OPEC, a cartel of Oil Producing Export Countries, right? According to the EIA, the US imported 7.9 million barrels of crude oil DAILY last year.
5849 2018-10-17 15:31:18 Interesting that the strain makes a difference.
I have heard things about the oil and such. That would be worth checking out.
5850 2018-10-17 15:31:10 unless the pipeline is for cannibis oil.  for import into the US LOL 
5851 2018-10-17 15:31:00 Oil is a financial product. Any of these Austrians looking for inflation in high oil futes are dreaming. Inflation will show up in refined products & retail oil

-Contains fiber & antioxidants

Simply sauté sliced cabbage in a pan with olive oil, garlic, & desired seasonings. Have as a side dish or use as a topping on your next sandwich!

5864 2018-10-17 15:30:06 Having another north-kora in the region means the oil price will go up and up until it reaches over 100 USD. This is huge impact on your economies. Stop MBS before its too late

5868 2018-10-17 15:30:00 Rolling back protections from oil & gas pollution with this lobbyist-fueled bill in the final days of the legislative session is an affront to PA families and a giveaway to industry special interests. #HB2154
5869 2018-10-17 15:29:57 HHJ Altham. There’s been a fair bit of controversy due to his family’s links to the oil and gas industry.

5872 2018-10-17 15:29:50 I use a combination of olive oil, soy sauce, worcestershire, sriracha, mustard, pepper, garlic powder, and lime juice
5873 2018-10-17 15:29:49 p.s. FDR is the Democrat President who forged an alliance with Saudi Arabia for their vast oil reserves, maybe you should research history before you attempt to hand power back to the side that has been destroying this country since the Civil War.
5874 2018-10-17 15:29:44 I doubt they'll fail to ' enlist' Saudi arabias help, they basically are " the oil market" reputations are at stake here, not lives. The guy is dead.

5877 2018-10-17 15:29:36 They are too important of an ally. They only accept oil purchases in dollars and put the revenue in US Treasury bonds.

1. Yesterday he addressed in Delhi Meeting of Heads of Oil & Gas Companies primarily to bring down the fuel price and to argue for accepting Indian Rupees for Import of Crude Oil.
5893 2018-10-17 15:28:25 A former CEO of Imperial Oil (Exxon's affiliate in Canada) once told me that he spent most of his time (about 1/3rd) on leadership & employee development. He did this, he said, to insure the future of the business and the continuity of its values.
5894 2018-10-17 15:28:24 Futures volume relates only to punting & risk management. Forward/Spot markets set prices. If & when China kicks off oil c.i.f. Shanghai forward contract auctions we will see a buy-side benchmark develop. As it is sell-side is trying  to get there first basis Brent #OOTT
5895 2018-10-17 15:28:24 #Nigerian President Muhammadu #Buhari must think history is threatening to repeat itself as he watches his main challenger in February elections, #Atiku Abubakar, do what he did three years ago: build a broad alliance to win power in Africa’s biggest oil producer
5896 2018-10-17 15:28:20 Manchester United if run correctly does not need oil money to financially blow away the likes of city, psg. I still believe the club has only just scratched their revenue potential considering how big it is. Just don't think glazers are ambitious enough to take us their . #MUFC
5897 2018-10-17 15:28:13 I love when CBD oil is mentioned and ppl are like “oh no, I don’t mess with that stuff” 
Sooo, you don’t mess with natural alternatives to medicine?... oh okay
5898 2018-10-17 15:28:04 What do they do, heat the vegetable oil to separate the vegetable solids from the vegetable fat?  That's just crazy there.
5899 2018-10-17 15:28:02 Vape or use oil orally.
5900 2018-10-17 15:27:59 So, what you are suggesting is that PM @narendramodi should have threatened oil suppliers instead of facilitating the process.. Very Good..... and then you describe yourself as an expert in Business & Economics...
5901 2018-10-17 15:27:56 very much a 'family' business in the style of the genco pura olive oil company
5902 2018-10-17 15:27:52 I think if Saudi Arabia can take over Pakistan by just developing an oil refinery then the writer,imo, forgets about the investment portfolio of CPec..
Writer had very loosy n biased premise on which he developed his argument.
5903 2018-10-17 15:27:47 Rant- if we don't go after Saudi Arabia, then I don't believe in any of the bs. Looks like really just care about oil and power.
5904 2018-10-17 15:27:45 Oh my god you're a snake oil salesman
5905 2018-10-17 15:27:39 I agree with that. Oil hasnt had a real bear market since 2000. The 08 crash was a hiccup followed by another $100 dollar 6 year party. Just as the 014 crash was about to get real, it shot back up again.

5908 2018-10-17 15:27:24 It’s around that time of the year again that I pretty much have to bathe in lotion and coconut oil because my skin and cold weather just don’t mix well with each other
5909 2018-10-17 15:27:13 Still pondering a coverup as good for our national interest. Perhaps bc of my limited geopolitical knowledge (rdg LOTS about Russia/Ukraine/US.)

5914 2018-10-17 15:26:50 I'm sure everyone's got a relative who has worked as a petrol pump attendant. It doesn't change the fact that fracking has been done for over 60 years now, with no genuine problems. Heck people like you even object to the cleaning up of nature's own oil spills.

5917 2018-10-17 15:26:42 This should have been expected... remember the massive corruption scheme that was Oil-For-Food?  As China also finding out re soybeans, it's hard to effectively sanction/tariff a specific fungible commodity from a specific country, creates arbitrage opportunities all over.

5956 2018-10-17 15:23:42 Why is it that oil companies are importing crude as their raw material for cooking oil instead of soya sunflower seed or cotton seed.    Why is it that farmers fail these products when there is so much demand for them.

5963 2018-10-17 15:22:55 Oil money. Not blood money.  I actually dont care if its blood money or no tbh we need a change
5964 2018-10-17 15:22:51 With the oil, I just give it a good shake after I’ve closed the bag. I think you could add more oil if you wanted, or use popcorn oil to get flavor more like purchased microwave corn? 

It’s a very cheap recipe so you can definitely play around with it and not feel too bad
5965 2018-10-17 15:22:51 Screw crude oil, today was a massive L
5966 2018-10-17 15:22:48 The headline is snake oil as usual. 

Before Parliament voted to approve Theresa May’s Art.50 notice in Feb’17, Brexit was still only a narrow majority result in an opinion poll.

The 650 MPs decided to Brexit, not the 17.4m.
5967 2018-10-17 15:22:37 Nothing Will happen so long as we need saudi oil
5968 2018-10-17 15:22:36 He still a kid, he doesn’t know what he is saying 

Actually he even doesn’t know where’s SAUDIA in a map.. someone gave him a money and ask him to go to SA embassy and record this video..

If the UK sell weapons to SA
KSA sell Oil to UK 

Stop and we will stop.. easily?! Is it!
5969 2018-10-17 15:22:27 WM has taken 92% of scots oil and gas for 50 years and STILL near bankrupted the UK.
Scots deserve better and can do better.
5970 2018-10-17 15:22:24 I am always wondering why an oil rich state (say Saudi, or maybe Dankse East Europe) doesn't offer a clearing house for anonymous crypto tokens back into real currencies. The US lets them wage war, so a few drug trades shouldn't rock the boat too much.
5971 2018-10-17 15:22:17 All analysts are missing a critical point - Saudi/UAE currencies are hard pegged with USD which is used in international OIL trade.
5972 2018-10-17 15:22:15 World stocks slide on earnings misgivings; oil off after big U.S. inventory build

5974 2018-10-17 15:22:12 Time to rev up #BiafranRestoration! @Atiku is another #MiyettiAllah patron. He will be worst than @mbuhari going by his body language. #FulaniIslamizationOfBiafra will be in top gear once he comes in by virtue of the already finalized oil agreements with #Britain.

5976 2018-10-17 15:22:03 Reagan economic boom was driven by a 3-fold drop in the price of oil, at a time when our economy was twice as energy intensive as it is today.
5977 2018-10-17 15:22:02 Stop selling weapons to SA, sanction the daylights out of anyone who does, hold them accountable for 9/11 and human rights violations. Invest heavy in renewable resources, obliterate need for oil, create new jobs for renewable energy, make a new dawn for USA.
5978 2018-10-17 15:22:01 FUCKING FISH FINGERS!!!!!! I fry u then u pop the oil beside my eye!!!!!!!!!!!! I wasn’t the one who killed u so WHY!!!!!!!!!!!
5979 2018-10-17 15:21:57 y’all finna get some oil money
5980 2018-10-17 15:21:56 Nothing will said or done till the oil runs out it’s just the way it is sad times
5981 2018-10-17 15:21:55 Oil has no fundamental or technical reason for it to trade at the level its trading at currently! EV revolution, lower demand from China and India moving to greener fuel means lower oil prices. Just short it! #OOTT
5982 2018-10-17 15:21:37 Venezuela failed because of the isolationist policies implemented that essentially rendered their massive oil reserves useless as an export despite their oil exports being their main source of GDP.

5993 2018-10-17 15:20:54 To be honest,nowadays the oil money thing is becoming more of a blessing with how inflated the market is plus your current owners are somewhat problematic so the saudi arabia offer should be considered and thank for if if happen

5996 2018-10-17 15:20:28 I’ve had decent experiences with CBD oil, so it’s clearly the THC that gets me. Not terribly surprising given I have mental health issues. Psychoactives tend to affect us differently.
5997 2018-10-17 15:20:24 If y’all fucking for more than 30 mins, check your oil.
5998 2018-10-17 15:20:19 So, voting against big oil, is voting against the people of Texas? When did Texans become corporate property?

I just want CBD oil / edibles, no desire to get high
6001 2018-10-17 15:20:03 It’s true..SA can stand on their own without foreign help cause of the mighty oil.( slap in the wrist punishment)
6002 2018-10-17 15:19:58 Look for Married women and help them service their engines while their husbands are away... Put better oil inside the engine
6003 2018-10-17 15:19:56 the most rebellious stunt i’ve ever done is when i was 5 i poured a bottle o’ sesame oil (was expensive back in the day in Japan) on the kitchen floor and oil-skated on it cos my mum didn’t let me go ice-skating
6004 2018-10-17 15:19:51 Black Castor oil, I got mine back in 3 months lmao. I was devastated
6005 2018-10-17 15:19:38 We have a lot more than oil.
6006 2018-10-17 15:19:38 That's an argument *for* trees. They lock the carbon away for hundreds of years, while we stop burning oil. Unless we use the hemp fibre for long term things like building, most of the carbon gets back into the atmosphere.

OTOH, Canada legalized cannabis today.

6010 2018-10-17 15:19:18 You were perfectly diplomatic. Anyone with half a brain knew that Facebook was selling the kind of Silicon Snake Oil that Clifford Stoll tried to warn us about in the '90s. Problem was, Stoll's prediction was too early.
6011 2018-10-17 15:19:16 Can confirm, 5 years of YAG, he didn't deliver any of his major promises!
1. Oil still found only in tonnes as drugs.
2. Not a single Sports Arena Built (ask google what it is, if you must)
3. Beyniyas Nubeynias 
He only fucked up existing schemes like flats &Aasandha!

6017 2018-10-17 15:18:43 working an oil terminal with a quarry across the river that routinely dynamites the hell out of their stone is a bit unsettling.   Am I gonna blow up!?  Let’s hope not.
6018 2018-10-17 15:18:38 add heavy whipping cream - then use oil or grease on the pan, if too sticky try turning the heat down some. Salt and pepper after bottom starts to harden but before the whole thing turns hard.
6019 2018-10-17 15:18:37 My dad's just spoke about the fact cannabis oil is now legal is Canada and said it's about time it was legal here in the UK. This is a man who's never touched a joint, and he can see the pros of it medicinally. Go poppa Foz!

6023 2018-10-17 15:18:20 Oh. This is actually remarkably easy.

Olive oil in the pan, about enough to make a thin coat on the bottom
Get it hot to where it's just about smoking
Put the eggs in
Work them gently for 2-3 minutes and then get them the fuck out immediately
Enjoy fluffy creamy eggs

6026 2018-10-17 15:18:14 “Add oil”, traduzione inglese dell’incoraggiamento cinese 加油 (forza!), è stata aggiunto nell’Oxford English Dictionary. L’utilizzo di “add oil” si era diffuso a HK.

6041 2018-10-17 15:17:42 The U.S. is extremely limited in what it can do to Saudi Arabia. In 1973 KSA agreed to accept ONLY Dollars for its oil. That fact has made the U.S. Dollar the World Standard Reserve currency and has made the U.S. the richest empire on Earth and has funded our military dominance.

6045 2018-10-17 15:17:24 Saudi's have never been held accountable, our leaders are influenced by oil interests, buildings & a few $'s? If POTUS fails to act the Senate must, this will hurt POTUS more then he realizes. 19 of 21 hijackers on 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia? No accountability? Time to squeeze

6052 2018-10-17 15:16:55 It is high time we started taking renewable energy sources seriously. Oil, gas, and coal are contributing to #ClimateBreakdown and we need better solutions fast.

6063 2018-10-17 15:16:25 If you are tired or lose your courage, you need “add oil”. Yes, a genuine Chinese idiom or metaphor which means keep going (roughly) is now in Oxford English Dictionary!
6064 2018-10-17 15:16:19 I literally created an empath essential oil blend because I was picking up EVERYONES shit and carrying it like my own and it helped tremendously. Fuck you and your instagram advice
6065 2018-10-17 15:16:15 Talk is cheap.
The hard part is getting an energy policy that uses our own energy reserves and removes our dependence on their oil.
I'm quite tired of our soldiers spilling their blood for that oil.
Time to stop the stupid.
But lobbyists with $$$$ come first in Congress.
6066 2018-10-17 15:16:08 I think it will stop when they’re all gone and have been replaced with oil drilling rigs, mining companies, and cattle and sheep.
6067 2018-10-17 15:16:06 Yes wash with spring water. Try rose hip or Argan oil if tea tree is too trying, both are good cleansing and moisturizing. The lavender will definitely help with inflammation

6072 2018-10-17 15:15:49 When working in the oil patch(oil sands, drilling rigs, pipeline, etc....) you have to do a pre employment drug test. Civil construction does drug tests after an incident.

6074 2018-10-17 15:15:40 We don't need anyone's oil anymore.  Iran can give it to Cuba
6075 2018-10-17 15:15:12 I used to do that with chocolate chip cookies. I had a whole order form for chip choices, nuts/no, shortening/oil, etc.
6076 2018-10-17 15:15:12 How did i still end up paying $60 & the oil change was free?
6077 2018-10-17 15:15:11 Getting my oil changed by dad should be so proud
6078 2018-10-17 15:15:09 They can't deal with facts, it goes back to Henry Kissinger's interfering with President Carter's dealing with Iran and the Shaw who wanted to go back to Iran & face trile, but was healed hostage in Panama untill his health failed by people working at the behest of oil interest
6079 2018-10-17 15:15:05 This dude asked if free oil changes came with the free top off policy
That we offer

6091 2018-10-17 15:14:16 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
6092 2018-10-17 15:14:13 Tea tree is really drying for me. My skin is super sensitive. :( I will try lavender oil diluted in maybe rose hip? I have witch hazel, too. Should I wash with spring water?
6093 2018-10-17 15:14:07 Follow the money. Ergodan wants low interest loans from Saudis. US only deals with them for oil, otherwise could give a damn if all the sand gets glassed.

6095 2018-10-17 15:14:03 Remember, lest ye be tempted by his Maverickness: he wields tremendous power as a Senator. He could derail... anything... with a well-placed vote.  Yet he sides with Trump & McConnell > 95% of the time. Sasse is human snake- oil.

6100 2018-10-17 15:13:33 USA in 1965,
Stop war with Pak, else we won't supply wheat
Shastri Ji : I don't care.

USA in 1998,
Dont dare to test nuclear weapons
Atal Ji: I don't care.

USA in 2018,
Stop defence deal with Russia and stop to buy oil from Iran.

Modi Ji - I don't care.

6101 2018-10-17 15:13:31 Happy Legal Day, Canada! If I wasn't in California, recreationally enjoying and also treating my intestinal issues and anxiety with marijuana and cbd oil, I would totally be in you, enjoying today! Homesick as ever, but super relieved I won't have to worry about where to get it!
6102 2018-10-17 15:13:18 Remember, Bush colluded with the Saudis to get their families out of the U.S. right after 9/11. Collusion with the Saudis has been going on for a long time. The main constituencies are money and oil, not the American people or our values.
6103 2018-10-17 15:13:18 And that’s either cracked right on the pan or pre-scrambled in a mug. But proper pre-heating is the important bit; too cold and it’ll stick, too hot and it’ll spit at you. It should cook just a bit before it penetrates the oil so that it doesn’t stick, but doesn’t blister.
6104 2018-10-17 15:13:13 how long can you go without an oil change? i was supposed to go today and i went but i didn’t know who to ask or where to go so i left :(((
6105 2018-10-17 15:13:11 It's due to oil and the oil based monetary system. Their terrified to pissed the Saudis off, just like with 911.
6106 2018-10-17 15:13:09 
6107 2018-10-17 15:13:07 In fact, if this Saudi thing escalates, and oil price skyrockets, timing for another Scot ref could be perfect! 
6108 2018-10-17 15:13:07 Yep, this. I mix butter and gold olive oil (not the virgin stuff) 50/50. Raises the smoke point of the butter without losing any flavor. And with stainless, you gotta use a metric f**k-ton of butter.
6109 2018-10-17 15:13:07 i have yet to find a good mask, period. just make sure u usin a good cleanser to slough off dead skin cells before u add moisturizer! i officially pulled out my vitamin e oil for the szn cus that ho is literally my skin’s crack

President Trump must impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. Mexican economy first source of income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture. Keep the remittances tax until Mexico totally stops U.S. invasion from its territory
6114 2018-10-17 15:12:48 Today is a new day and so is the oil pattern.  Getting ready for the Bear Open.  Yesterday I made a 120pin improvement but I really need to refocus and find the zone.  Just keep getting better...
6115 2018-10-17 15:12:45 yeah of course i just think it’s a funny way of bundling lmao. obviously it’s a go bc, ya know, the oil industry can suck my lady balls
6116 2018-10-17 15:12:43 What is your problem? Better oil you your own machine .
6117 2018-10-17 15:12:43 Actually at the moment, the US is among the top producers of oil. We switched from cheap Iranian oil to expensive American oil. Probably was a pre condition to approving the latest arms package.

6119 2018-10-17 15:12:41 Historical records have people start using hot oil for both cooking and warfare at nearly the same time. Someone either burned themselves while cooking and said "You can do this to other people" or burned someone alive and said "Damn that smells good."
6120 2018-10-17 15:12:39 I’ll give Boot exactly this much: he says he voted for Hillary. It’s all the ones (Bush, Vance, French) who lead with “I’m so anti-Trump that I didn’t vote in 2016!” who I’d like to soak in oil and light on fire.

6126 2018-10-17 15:12:16 My husband uses a sativa oil during the day and an indication oil at night, on a cracker. I went and stocked up yesterday because God only knows if they're going to shut down our dispensary.

6128 2018-10-17 15:12:06 My guess is the buyers from yesterday can't afford this market to plunge further unless there are important newsflow, imbalances will play a role; at the same time $CL #oil needs to be monitored whether it'll stay over $70; low oil px good for consumers $SPY $ES is at 2795 now

6148 2018-10-17 15:11:12 Oh, yeah, bacon grease makes it stick like crazy. My advice: use butter or olive oil, make sure it’s at least hot enough to shimmer when you put the egg on. They don’t really have to warm up; I make eggs straight outta the fridge that way without even needing a spatula.

6156 2018-10-17 15:10:52 Trouble is Canada is not buying it. Countries generally do not buy oil, thought they sometimes support or purchase energy infrastructure. Much of Canada's energy infrastructure is privately owned. It's a consumers market. Best we can do is get oil to tidewater more effiiciently.

6159 2018-10-17 15:10:38 The wonderful thing about texas is it's bigger then oil and gas. We could take all the money and resources and start investing in renewable energy like solar and wind. Which would create just as many of not more jobs then oil and gas, but all you hear is let's kill oil and gas.

6162 2018-10-17 15:10:23 FF do not receive subsidies.  Subsidies are direct cash outlays from Treasury /loan guarantees / tax credits. The oil / gas industry does not get them but the alt energy  cos do. What liberals call subsidies  are depletion / depreciation, in the tax code for every business.

Without the oil the US would be calling them ragheads and bombing the shit out of them. The Saudis know this.
6166 2018-10-17 15:10:06 Or they could go all Russia on the Ukraine, smuggle soldiers in as 'tourists' them smuggle weapons and tanks and shit in then pretend it's a domestic insurrection even though everyone's clearly wearing debadged uniforms of a certain country. But then the oil stops.

6184 2018-10-17 15:08:53 It’s all relative and oil dependence enables the despotism we see today. Musk is bringing much needed new tech to the globe making manufacturers follow suit. To pretend it’s just another company is delusional. Go buy gun stocks since it’s all the same...
6185 2018-10-17 15:08:51 So... Instead of investing in a defunct oil industry can Canada become the leaders in the hemp industry now? Since farmers won't be mistaken for drug production when growing incredibly versatile crops? Just a thought...

6209 2018-10-17 15:07:43 It's not the money, the Saudi's fund the Democrats, always have. They're the largest investors into hysterical far left 'journalist' outfits too (like TYT), which is why this isn't getting the coverage it would if it were the French, say. The issue is OPEC and oil.
6210 2018-10-17 15:07:34 And just think how much more crude oil we would need to produce today (at what price?) to meet transportation fuel demand if most of the resid was still being burned in power plants instead of run through cokers to make lighter products.

6213 2018-10-17 15:07:17 Indeed. For all of his faults he's done nothing but good there. Fighting a war for oil is far more sensible than fighting one for "democracy" or some vague notion of human rights. (Also why his remarks against Assad were so cringe inducing)
6214 2018-10-17 15:07:16 The killing of #JamalKhashoggi just go to show how incompetent and extremely arrogant, the Saudi administration/Royal are.
We can do anything with impunity because, we have the money. If any punitive action is taken against us, we will stop pumping oil.

6254 2018-10-17 15:04:43 It's necessary to help maintain the viscosity of the oil blend, and also to help prevent caking of the dry ingredients. However, it's only included in small amounts (<35 mg per serving) which is perfectly safe to consume.

6265 2018-10-17 15:04:05 Yes but if 45 goes to war with Iran he needs SA to make up for that loss of oil output.
6266 2018-10-17 15:03:59 So i'm doing a nizoral mask and squalene oil cuz I need my glow to get back to what is was 3 months ago.
6267 2018-10-17 15:03:56 Just think how many more jobs would be created if we could get our heads out of the sand and start moving forward with legalizing marijuana. The fact that CBD oil has been criminalized is proof that current administration doesn’t get it.
6268 2018-10-17 15:03:56 Always dangerous to think like that but hard to be positive on grains looking at crude oil.
6269 2018-10-17 15:03:45 We are net exporters of oil now. A decade or more ago, your point would have been valid.

6283 2018-10-17 15:02:25 Russia behaves despicably. Likewise, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, NKorea, etc. Trump's job is to walk a political tightrope & keep them from nuking us, bombing us, cutting off our oil, attacking our allies. His job is not to be heavy-handed & shut down diplomacy at each violation.

I said as soon as the journo disappeared the biggest test would be on the UK and US... The former is thus far paying lip service... The latter, well, I really don't think Trump could give a shit. I don't think anything long term will happen.
6302 2018-10-17 15:01:04 As soon as an oil company spills its oil, its stock tanks.  As soon as a company puts something harmful in its ingredients and puts that ingredient list out, people drop their support and their stock tanks.

6328 2018-10-17 14:59:06 I'll guess, a drilling company with 4 major investors.

Few "independent" oil companies are truly independent. Mostly a front of plausible deniability for larger companies.
Me, I'd work on a fracking job *in my home town*, happily. I know what I'm doing, and do give a shit.
6329 2018-10-17 14:59:05 Us want oil to go down not to increase
There is nothing about oil in this
6330 2018-10-17 14:59:04 What's with the oil wells in the background?

Ted is a liar. I don't think I'd quote tRump who is not reliable on these issues...though the 'broken clock' happens to be correct about Ted.
6331 2018-10-17 14:59:03 Mmmm that'll go great with some tomatoes and olive oil :)
6332 2018-10-17 14:58:59 This is how we know Trump has personal financial interests. The US does NOT need Saudi Arabia; they need us more. We no longer purchase substantial amounts of oil from them, there's no official arms deal (so no loss of $ for US), and we provide critical security for them.
6333 2018-10-17 14:58:55 Yeah lads jesus cured cancer with CBD oil.
6334 2018-10-17 14:58:53 And producers of vast amounts of oil which combined with humanities addiction to it may be an existential threat to us via climate change.  They could be a solar exporter tho and they should as oil will be used less as people realize we are killing ourselves.
6335 2018-10-17 14:58:47 Dry shampoo- always! Try a dry shampoo powder on your roots or anywhere you build up oil before you go to bed and then an invisible spray in the morning! It's magic. We love the Klorane Dry Shampoo with oat milk and the Healthy Sexy Hair Hair Laundry powder!

6347 2018-10-17 14:57:42 US crude oil inventory data looks promising. Brent below $80 mark (70’s) will be a big +ve, psychologically. Can this take Nifty into green?
6348 2018-10-17 14:57:36 Pompan looks like a foitvwith stupid smile when a Washington Post Jounalist was savaged and murdered at the hands of the very people your giggling with shame on you pawn of trump !

6350 2018-10-17 14:57:26 Dude I went to the DMV yesterday and I shit you not, there was a screen up on the TV saying seed oils were good for you.

I was like, “What.”

It had grape seed oil and sunflower oil listed as examples.
6351 2018-10-17 14:57:16 Coincidence Brandon. Just pure coincidence. It has nothing to do with the billions and oil.
6352 2018-10-17 14:57:15 Whatever game played Saudi Arabia always wins because in 2018 we are still depending the global economy on despot head choppers that allow companies to pump liquefied dinosaur shit for which we pay top dollar.  So again #BigOil wins.   Just as in the seventies oil 'crisis'
6353 2018-10-17 14:57:09 Ask me what is card maintenance?does my Atm card need oil or servicing?complete exploitation
6354 2018-10-17 14:57:04 The world should cut them off, let them drink their fcking oil. 
They are a brutal regime with no regard for human rights.
6355 2018-10-17 14:56:59 Especially as the judge should have recused himself due to his family links with gas and oil firms
6356 2018-10-17 14:56:58 When I tell people I work in an oil firm they be like should I send my account details n I be like do u have domicile account 
6357 2018-10-17 14:56:55 Just remember most of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi nationals! They are NOT our friends! Their oil and money is why our corrupt government kisses their corrupt asses!

6359 2018-10-17 14:56:52 9/11 had congress voting together to get stuff done (some good, like going to war, some bad, patriot act). It definitely brought the country together. The hindsight of it created sides of judging what was good and bad. What was the last unifying time? Opec oil crisis? Space race?
6360 2018-10-17 14:56:51 I hear ya. We are getting 30 mph gusts  snow flurries later I've been get supplies in.  !

6367 2018-10-17 14:56:09 G*LD needs to see rates move down before it's going to take off. Oil down already, so rates fall next IMO. Then gold rises.
6368 2018-10-17 14:55:55 Mine says her CBD oil is a cure all

6375 2018-10-17 14:55:18 #oil move was unexpected, took the broad market down further, c'est la vie; but one can't gamble before big numbers like that although it hurts leaving money on the table on the short side by covering $ES  before the crude number $SPY

6377 2018-10-17 14:55:08 Bc the gun token patriots to this country stay silent. But they will show up at the polls. They don't want illegal immigrants in Texas. They want to keep their oil jobs. Beto isn't going to do that

6380 2018-10-17 14:54:53 I think this whole Saudis wanting to buy out the Glazers story was made up by some City fans who got sick of United fans dissing them over their owners' Human Rights violations.

They're probably ROFLTAO at how those same United fans are now drooling over the Oil Money.
6381 2018-10-17 14:54:51 Buhari is not giving the political elites oil blocks, that’s why they are kicking yen yen yen. 

How many of your social media intellectuals, Buharists and ordinary Nigerians did he give? Did he give you? 

Somebody that is now sharing it among cabal, family and friends.
6382 2018-10-17 14:54:48 I agree that it definitely has to do with money because pharmach companies are writing state legislators checks, but when the The Attorney general of Ohio  (a Republican) openly states CBD oil is the same thing as pot, that would lead me to believe he thinks it gets you high
6383 2018-10-17 14:54:44 In Kansas back in the 80s or 90s, memory fails me on the decade,  Kansas was split because of oil. Hunting in western Kansas by folks from eastern Kansas was nearly shutdown. The hatred was very real. A state split by oil for crying out loud. The electoral college has to remain.
6384 2018-10-17 14:54:41 How many idiots here were so high on "OMG Iran Exports loss!!"? Well you dumb narrative pushers.....you just got rocked. Dunn fucks....buying because of news and not because of reality?? Idiots #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Crude #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #DXY

6386 2018-10-17 14:54:31 @SecretarySonny Don't you think its obscene to take grain off the food chain & into gas tanks? Oil is no longer the strategic issue it once was. With half the world starving it seems millionaire farmers could loose a little profit margin to stop ethanol.
6387 2018-10-17 14:54:30 And those 3 nations have what 2 things in common? Putin and oil 1+1=2

6390 2018-10-17 14:54:25 Mr. Collier has presented himself as an old school conservative Texas Democrat that cares about education, farm/ranch, oil/gas... evidently that has all been smoke and he is just another liberal Democrat trying to take over our state. I hope I am wrong.
6391 2018-10-17 14:54:25 Crude oil Nov18 70 Puts trade 100 times
6392 2018-10-17 14:54:21 oil.
6393 2018-10-17 14:54:13 I understand the importance of a strong ally that stands against Iran, but sanctions and condemnation need to be set. We must stand against this behavior. One Nation, under God. We don’t need their oil or brutal acts.
6394 2018-10-17 14:54:06 Obviously you don’t believe in Newton’s Law of Relativity when it comes to economics. NM is currently enjoying a 2 billion $ increase to its coffers. Put the expensive restraints on gas and oil that number goes down significantly. Of course you can raise the tax on gas.
6395 2018-10-17 14:54:04 $12 cad oil. cant beat that
6396 2018-10-17 14:54:02 We remember otto warmbier.. Saudi is way far close to US and oil the favourite

6403 2018-10-17 14:53:45 But they have money from oil!
And money seems to be trashing values and morals!
6404 2018-10-17 14:53:42 I need an oil change  everyday I wonder why the fuck I bought a car 
6405 2018-10-17 14:53:39 Uh, no. No one ever said officially that the Iraq War was about oil. Oil, in this case, is irrelevant.
6406 2018-10-17 14:53:38 Egg on face for TW BMD and Chris Oil
6407 2018-10-17 14:53:23 An ally that funded fundamentalist and extremism around the world, has a medieval government whose values have nothing in common with us. It has been about oil.
6408 2018-10-17 14:53:21 I’m in LNG in Houston. Trump has nothing to do with the oil boom.  This is good ol’ American ingenuity and small business constantly improving their processes. Trump is actively undermining our ability to market to China and making the cost of our projects rise from steel tariffs
6409 2018-10-17 14:53:04 This is not about lifestyle. Majority of emissions growth from heavy industry particularly oil and gas. For export.

6413 2018-10-17 14:52:44 America is not going to give up the money or oil that Saudi generates. 

You and the Congress and especially Trump are way too greedy to honor any morals.

6419 2018-10-17 14:52:27 For those who followed my advice and shorted Crude Oil-stay short as it is tumbling over $2.00 a barrel with the indexes. Looking for Crude Oil to be in the 58-62 range by next spring!!!! Last 69.65 a barrel. "Too many bulls." Filled on Oats. #Commodities #Crude #Oil #Stocks
6420 2018-10-17 14:52:22 If we had good savings, infrastructure n diversified econommy with vibrant agric n manufacturing, we wouldn't be affected by crude oil price crash...PDP was lucky in 16yrs that oil price was stable hence d stable FX but they were daft not to put dat 2 open up other sectors
6421 2018-10-17 14:52:11 That’s easy! Just attack them like Iraq and take over the oil. Oh wait... many billions of $$$ of arms deals would have to be cancelled. Damn it!

6424 2018-10-17 14:52:00 Of course. Get off oil altogether. Solar, wind, organic and plant based fuel. New kinds of jobs and a new economy bringing us cleaner air and water. But, the @GOP has no intention of using science and new tech to go forward. They need to keep their oil & coal loving donors happy.
6425 2018-10-17 14:51:54 Great. We don’t need to sell oil after all to pay off national debt. We need more highways to truck weed

6437 2018-10-17 14:50:19 Agreed Mr Khanna. Trick is howeveralways in the details. How does one balance that with the arms purchase/jobs, oil dependencies, help needed with Iran, risk of Russia setting up bases there, and broader middle Eastern peace. Diplomacy is what is needed. Give it time.

6503 2018-10-17 14:46:24 Nigeria solid minerals are one of the purest. If well managed by addition of value chain, Nigeria will ignore crude oil for this untapped avenue.

6604 2018-10-17 14:40:09 An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aroma compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetherolea, or simply as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove.

Not like the lisinoril, baby aspirin, and fish oil combo the VA put me on making by BP drop way to far... I can suffer with hig cholesterol, but bad vision?  No.

6819 2018-10-17 14:27:54 In August, because of the 25% tariff imposed by China, its import of soya bean from the US has dropped 90% to only 130 thousand tonnes. China is desperately looking for alternatives to replace soya bean oil, palm oil is no doubt the best alternative. Palm oil price should go up.
6820 2018-10-17 14:27:47 You really think we aren't taxed only because we have the largest reserves of oil? We are heavily taxed, it's still not enough to support all the public and social programms.

Do you buy and sell oil?
6823 2018-10-17 14:27:28 Yes! How much longer will the US bow to the Saudi's because of oil when we are capable of becoming increasingly energy independent if we would focus on developing the technology.  If America is so great, then we should be the leaders in alternative energy development.

6844 2018-10-17 14:26:19 Myth: "MSPO signifies sustainable palm oil."
Fact: While a step in the right direction, MSPO certification falls short in many areas (e.g. on preventing deforestation or peat destruction) and as such is insufficient in itself to identify sustainable production.

6862 2018-10-17 14:25:24 Doesn't mean they don't want more. Technically a large part of that is in oil and as that is eventually running out they want to diversify to stop them running out of money too.

Again you will be drinking the oil in your region! Powered Battery car is coming Nig soon
6879 2018-10-17 14:24:30 They made our economy oil dependent in order to derive maximum advantage within a short tenure. Oil deals were never transparent.

Why is nobody getting this?
6884 2018-10-17 14:24:09 Try steaming over a bowl of boiling water with about 12 drops of Tea Tree oil in it and a towel over your head.
It helps me.
6885 2018-10-17 14:23:58 It happened right before i came home actually! I arrived to a bunch of oil spilled all over the floor pfff

The roomie who got splashed by the oil seems to be ok. None of it went in his eyes, thankfully.
6886 2018-10-17 14:23:52 Right, I use different brands. Cantu, curly kids, design essentials. Whatever helps keep the curl, but I use black castor oil and coconut oil daily. I rencently twisted my hair up.. hoping for some locs. I’m tired of the maintenance lol
6887 2018-10-17 14:23:51 .@SenRichAlloway: At the 11th hour, @PASenateGOP leadership is pushing a bill rolling back safeguards from oil&gas pollution that protect PA families. Oil&gas industry is again promoting their toxic agenda for political gain. Vote NO on #HB2154.

6889 2018-10-17 14:23:45 Just like the sanctions we put on North Korea and China was still shipping them oil?
6890 2018-10-17 14:23:45 They also think porn is a legit public health issue while simultaneously writting laws that allow companies to dump oil waste into the environment, which is a legitimate public health issue. Both parties suck but Republicans suck 1000% more.

6903 2018-10-17 14:22:34 Archaic mindset or regressive mindset or dormant mindset only responsible for criticizing fuel price hike. India doesn't have enough oil reserves that it could exploit within the country and accordingly price the deisel/petrol as per it's domestic political requirements
6904 2018-10-17 14:22:14 4) -a worldwide famine before 1999, that the oil reserves would be depleted by the Millennium, or that the Arctic #PolarIce Cap would disappear by 2014 - all of which have proved to be demonstrably wrong - as well as the confession by environmental scientists that they falsified-

6907 2018-10-17 14:21:49 The Igbo man DONT need ur sympathy, tell ur children children that Igbos  killed ur parents, I have heard it from several of u but we are not moved. Those who rule the nation are still not better off than us. Oil that has made u to deny the Igbos are not urs today unfortunately
6908 2018-10-17 14:21:26 I disagree with this. Both parties have issues but if you follow the legislation being written by both parties, you'd understand which one has your better interest in mind. For example, Republicans have banned CBD oil Ohio because they think it gets you high.
6909 2018-10-17 14:21:19 And I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I can sell for a really good price.  The US government needs to stop coddling these countries.  Developers alternative sources of energy already.  We are tied to them because of the oil.  Enough already,

Fact2: Government intervention made the energy crisis worse (inverimnetak regulations, price controls) 
Fact3: The embargo was the straw that broke the camel's back
Fact 4: Everything was blamed on the straw!

6918 2018-10-17 14:21:04 The important issue is sanctions and the reclamation of Syria's oil and gas fields. Without both, reconstruction will be very slow. I think this is why CW is such an important issue and why we all have to pretend. Otherwise what is the legal rationale for a US presence in Syria?

6921 2018-10-17 14:20:54 Social programs? You mean healthcare and education? I’m for a revenue neutral federal carbon tax with reductions in payroll tax incentivizing consumers to reduce carbon footprint and industrial innovation to get off oil or at least a reduction in consumption.
6922 2018-10-17 14:20:48 There were definitely a few of us... The only thing we were burning was the midnight oil. Still are!
6923 2018-10-17 14:20:42 If we REALLY want to stop Saudi we need to stop buying their oil. That means no cars, no household chemicals, no plastics etc etc. So, who wants to go first?
6924 2018-10-17 14:20:33 Hahahaha hahahaha.
6925 2018-10-17 14:20:31 My reply b4 they deleted d tweet... @APCUKingdom so the return of the search of oil in Bauchi.. and proposal to review railroad is an achievement. Mehn ur level of thinking is something else. In 3years + Na only 2 states u fit name dust as accolades with 9ja of 36 states.
6926 2018-10-17 14:20:24 How do you make the weed with oil and how do u mix it with seasonings??
6927 2018-10-17 14:20:23 We will never run out of oil, due to the last few barrels of oil costing billions of dollars.

6937 2018-10-17 14:19:47 @IngrahamAngle Laura, to answer the job question on your radio show, a lot of people in the oil and gas industry, engineers and others will many years of experience, can’t find jobs.
6938 2018-10-17 14:19:44 That's the one. The assembled crowd looks like an oil painting.
6939 2018-10-17 14:19:39 I'm still slightly surprised the oil market is not pricing in potential Saudi/US friction.  Oil is kind of following stocks (lower).
6940 2018-10-17 14:19:37 My mom just hooked me up with some CBD oil and various other CBD products, let me know if interested!

6950 2018-10-17 14:19:03 Your American hedge fund owners support all the great work U & the @nationalpost are doing with your exceptional public relations for big oil and American style capitalism.

6952 2018-10-17 14:18:49 1973-Arab nations of #OPEC declared a crude oil embargo on any nation supporting #Israel. Oil went from $12 a barrel to $79. Called “The Oil Weapon”, it made gas rationing & long lines appear at stations in the US & England.
6953 2018-10-17 14:18:46 hear hear, Well said Rand!!!! #SaudiArabia's true colours on show for all to see, nothing but a Mafia state, when the oil runs out they will be running around chopping each other up!!!, greedy, greedy, greedy
6954 2018-10-17 14:18:41 Saudi Arabia will announce the investment package of $8b for Pakistan soon. Oil on deferred payments for three years will also be part of that package.

6962 2018-10-17 14:17:35 This is all a continual process to degrade Native rights and the government to government relationship of Native citizenship, in order to open Native lands to oil / gas / mineral extraction and the way they do that is to eradicate Native citizenship, by any means necessary

6967 2018-10-17 14:17:20 There are many cannabinoid products with terpenes removed. Terpenes give cannabis strains their unique aromas. Cannabinoids are available by using CBD isolate as an oil or powder. CBD isolate or may not contain THC, as you prefer. It can be consumed in food/drink. No stink.
6968 2018-10-17 14:17:20 The real questions to me are, who is the source ? How much are we paying?  We had oil for product deals, is that still going on?

Even cking oil whose availability is imprvng by each day has gone up by 25%. Bread prices are stagnant  but with reduced weight thus an increase in real terms.

6979 2018-10-17 14:16:35 Is that a fuel/oil slick we can see?

6982 2018-10-17 14:16:25 Accepted by whom? Not everyone accepts Israel’s innocence. It’s all abt $$/oil. Palestinians have been wrongly accused of so much by Israel it’s sickening. Anyone who reads can see the truth. Naturally, Kush working w MSB & Bibi on *peace plan*, wherein Palestinians have no say.
6983 2018-10-17 14:16:23 Looks like we only get 10% of our oil from the saudis. We can wean ourselves from it if we really wanted to. We can improve fuel efficiency in our vehicles & negotiate with other oils producing nations. The saudis were the ones that took down the twin towers. When will we learn?

6986 2018-10-17 14:16:10 Doesn't matter. There will be no conclusive evidence, it will be only speculation, and there will be no impactful punishment. They are "too important to be punished". We put ourselves in this position by over reliance on oil.

7008 2018-10-17 14:14:42 this makes so much sense. i used it for a year and was constantly getting pimples despite having skin on the drier side that tends to stay clear — maybe my skin was overproducing oil to compensate?? either way my skin has been rly good since i ran out of it

7018 2018-10-17 14:13:45 Can't we just level them? We should make an example out of them. Carpet bomb them and light the oil fields on fire.
7019 2018-10-17 14:13:32 The Kochs' Brent oil future exchange in London already trading December futures. WTI still November. Why? Thousands of dark trades by Russians. Buying and selling to each other. Bumping up the prices each time.
 WTI $70 @ barrel. Brent $80 @ barrel. See?

7026 2018-10-17 14:12:50 #Bali #IMF : The three main topics that cropped up regularly during the 2018 meetings were:(1) the overly dominant role of the USD in the global financial system,(2) the US-China trade war, and (3) stresses in emerging markets, made worse for some by the sharp rise in oil prices.

7030 2018-10-17 14:12:45 Sisssss....went to a natural hair event at Facebook and someone said that they were frying onions and then putting the oil in their hair...willingly smelling like friend onions
7031 2018-10-17 14:12:42 This black woman is educating this hispanic man on why he’s not supposed to throw away his oil after only one use of frying chicken. 
7032 2018-10-17 14:12:38 No...rarity!
Saudi are long past their peak output, fracking is banned in half the world and the oil reserves we do have for another 200years or so, will be needed in priority for industrial chemicals & plastics...
7033 2018-10-17 14:12:33 @VW does the Golf 7 have a problem with oil usage? I have seen a number of complaints relating to the high oil consumption usage and I seem to have a similar issue. Have lodged a complaint on the matter to no avail.

7035 2018-10-17 14:12:24 Like, did you really expect him to put his hands up? Past and present human rights in this country are horrendous. Is your need for oil greater than your judgement
7036 2018-10-17 14:12:22 I feel like as an Asian I should do the coconut oil.  There's probably some in my mum's kitchen somewhere.

7039 2018-10-17 14:12:01 Saudi Arabia is not a terrorist hotbed when compare to human, Pakistan, Syria or Iran. What they are supporters of terrorism which I will not dispute. And yes we should have held them accountable a long time ago but we enjoyed the oil
7040 2018-10-17 14:11:54 Trumps going to accept Saudi Arabia's handling investigation by their holding people accountable who were involved.

For the sake of money.

I say dump Saudi Arabia and work on Venezuelan oil. It's our side of the world. Those people need our help. Never abandon Israel.

7052 2018-10-17 14:10:50 We need to rely on our OWN sources of energy. Oil, oil shale, coal, etc and tell the Middle East to fuck off. Which party constantly blocks that?

7058 2018-10-17 14:10:30 You would have a larger GDP with all that oil you have. But no, your government cocked it up. We are similar in the way our gov allows multi national companies to pay FA tax for resources mined. Our economy would be massive if it was taxed properly.

7073 2018-10-17 14:09:19 Really. Pay attention! Millions of jobs created. Unemployment across America lowest in history! Welfare down! Stock market up. Companies running back to USA. Largest oil  producer! You are either brain dead or in deep Denial?America First!
7074 2018-10-17 14:09:19 Naghahanap lang ako pagkakakitaan, may oil price hike nanaman eh 
7075 2018-10-17 14:09:13 Reserve currency status means financial transactions (particularly oil sales) are denominated in USD. The USA uses that status to impose sanctions and make its enemies' economies scream (re Nixon on Chile). Our huge intel/mil is the muscle to enforce its continuance.

7084 2018-10-17 14:08:26 Pancakes made with oil are simply abysmal. A disgrace to pancakes every where.
7085 2018-10-17 14:08:24 Sec. Pompeo said U.S. would like #Turkey to buy "less" oil from Iran. It's a sign U.S. recognizes Turkish energy needs and that it can't simply cut off oil imports from Iran.
7086 2018-10-17 14:08:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.

i think the 3 and a half weeks of very much less oil is taking a toll on me now huhu
7093 2018-10-17 14:07:46 We did well holding you tight but it was as if you put oil to our hands and it just slipped so easily.
7094 2018-10-17 14:07:37 Maybe not as a prank, but to develop into oil over the thousands of years we have been here. And here we are, using it today. If that was the case, guess God knew what he was doing. Dont care perosnally. Being that I dont have to know in order to see His proof in the here and now
7095 2018-10-17 14:07:34 Also most Texans are past oil and gas .Wind and Solar are the fastest growing and more secure fields in energy. most Texan (like myself) want secure jobs for my fellow texans.
7096 2018-10-17 14:07:28 OPEC imposes an oil embargo against a number of Western countries, considered to have helped Israel in its war against Egypt and Syria.

7098 2018-10-17 14:07:25 Very true. Modi will not sleep till middle class become beggars. for this reason, Modi govt given a free hand to oil companies to increase fuel prices and imposed world highest taxes 28 % GST on common man. Only Congress could see the common man issues.

7101 2018-10-17 14:07:10 Not sure what you mean by "we don't have too" - carving Saudi oil out of the global commodity system before it gets to a US market would push US energy costs up exponetially, causing a massive recession.  In terms debt that may be true - but dollar dilineated oil is that - a debt
7102 2018-10-17 14:06:59 Live now, a history of the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States, from Saudi's founding in the 1930s to the oil crisis in 1973, from the first Gulf War to 9/11 to Secretary of State Pompeo's recent visit. Anna Vinden of @PennSAS joins us
7103 2018-10-17 14:06:59 Not sure what your Barnard vendetta is.  He advocates for WHOLE FOOD plant-based NO OIL diet.  Not faux 'vegan' products that are full of oil.
7104 2018-10-17 14:06:51 Today is the first time i heard of 'Snake oil'.
7105 2018-10-17 14:06:46 Guys in the oil field work 4-6 weeks straight with manual labor in friggin North Dakota winters.
Whaaaa. I gotta drink extra coffee 
7106 2018-10-17 14:06:44 I'm actually educated on green energy, so I don't agree at all. The dinosaurs running big oil don't want to let go. We don't need the Saudis or their oil. We need to modernize.

7110 2018-10-17 14:06:19 Another not quite related idea - to dry NaOH by just heating it till melting (or maybe even higher) and pouring into oil while rapidly mixing. Maybe even with some Mg already added. Wonder if that could be safe at all...
7111 2018-10-17 14:06:16 I like the lady, na so she come use oil polish face to 'look good'. Nice job anyway. Peace!
7112 2018-10-17 14:06:09 You probably already know, but also the fried food industry mainly uses Palm oil that is decimating our rainforests and taking many species to extinction.

7114 2018-10-17 14:06:06 Seriously? Please don't tell me you think the wealth generated by the international theft of Iraqi oil reserves has benefited the Iraqi populace from living standards pre invasion.  You're conflating wealth with oil production.

7125 2018-10-17 14:05:29 Remember: climate change is here, were gonna have to get off oil by 2050, and the saudis need us WAY more than we we need them.
7126 2018-10-17 14:05:08 Interesting. Is that stuff directed at native people? My impression is it was mostly to show the world that these places really are more than oil and deserts. As opposed to sinecures and more boring social spending for natives.
7127 2018-10-17 14:04:56 Lol... One can't leave the other o.. Make una do meeting decide.

7135 2018-10-17 14:04:25 No one phonier than you my friend. Everything about you is Bogus and a sham. You’re quite the snake oil salesman.Your father taught you well
7136 2018-10-17 14:04:17 Crazy statement that you have to know is untrue. Saudis purchase treasuries, buy military equipment and are critical to keeping oil prices low. We need them just as much as they need us; maybe more.
7137 2018-10-17 14:04:09 Have you tried CBD oil?
7138 2018-10-17 14:04:03 The @OED has officially added the 'chinglish' phrase 'add oil' (加油 in Chinese) to the dictionary. It recognises the versatile phrase as expressing 'encouragement, incitement or support.' #AddOil, #加油，#NewWords, #Chinese, #English

7143 2018-10-17 14:03:39 I’d also like to note the price of crude will likely never reach its peak like it did before. What happens in the next recession when demand goes down? Is producing oil even viable at a low price. I’d love to someone with a plan beyond oil.

7148 2018-10-17 14:03:27 Colorado Supreme Court hears arguments between children and COGCC over oil and gas safety
7149 2018-10-17 14:03:22 Glad the fracking protester were released. Shocking they were jailed in first place. Doesn't help when the judge has links to the oil and gas industry.
7150 2018-10-17 14:03:20 Trump's already come out and said that the Khashoggi issue is a non-issue as the US continues to reap benefits of oil and arms sales to the Saudis'. Forget about anything else. Just as Hollywood makes things appear surreal this isn't anything different. #press #us #money #trump
7151 2018-10-17 14:03:11 Correction, we continued a war due to Bushs response. It was just another excuse to look to control the oil market

An. Exploding. Churro.
7155 2018-10-17 14:03:00 If you own a gas burning vehicle then you should consider owning a oil stock. If I am going to cry at the pump then I want to at least smile at the bank!  #WednesdayWisdom

7158 2018-10-17 14:02:47 The court heard that Judge Robert Altham, who gave excessive sentences to the three men had family links to a company that supplies oil and gas rigs.

7160 2018-10-17 14:02:45 Unfortunately, with oil sales denominated in dollars, nothing will happen to SA bc of their ability to produce/steal the resource we need sold in our currency. This is embarrassing for us as a nation if nothing is done

7163 2018-10-17 14:02:24 I’d rather have a country of educated, healthy ppl than the opposite to which you need such a large military to keep them in check. Plus you invade everywhere that doesn’t play ball with oil. That’s why you’re money is wasted on military rather than education or healthcare.
7164 2018-10-17 14:02:20 Exclusive: OPEC has urged its members not to mention oil prices when discussing policy in a break from the past, as the oil producing group seeks to avoid the risk of U.S. legal action for manipulating the market,
7165 2018-10-17 14:02:19 Also they know that if they act to raise world oil prices it will make our domestic oil sources more profitable, which will increase investment and makes us even less dependant on them

7205 2018-10-17 14:00:15 What confusion is there? Taking in anything that requires your digestive organs to process it, breaks the fast. Butter coffee with MCT oil and intermittent fasting don’t mix. Intermittent fasting is where the magic happens. 20 hours is my magic #.
7206 2018-10-17 14:00:13 It's called a dead-cat bounce, a one-day head-fake rally in a longer term sell-off. Your deficit, your inflation, your oil price, your higher rates, are not very good for economic forecasts.

7271 2018-10-17 13:56:12 Imagine if the world actually tried to find an alternative to oil and the Saudi bastards were left for dead, sounds like a beautiful utopian scenario to me

7278 2018-10-17 13:55:37 People think that the reason Trump canceled the Iranian nuclear agreement was because it was an Obama success story.

Whatever the real reason is was going to require further dependence on Saudi Arabian oil.

Another Trump/Putin plan in jeopardy.

7280 2018-10-17 13:55:32 Trump has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
7281 2018-10-17 13:55:30 Unlike the other Middle Eastern countries, Turkey ‘Ain’t Got No’’ oil.
7282 2018-10-17 13:55:27 It doesn't matter whether the Saudis are telling the truth about Jamal Khashoggi. Or truth or lies about anything else. It doesn't matter because we still win big on oil and real estate investments in my Trump condos. Big wins. Huge wins. #Khashoggi

7287 2018-10-17 13:55:12 There are other royal regimes in the ME that don’t act like this and neither did their King. Iran’s oil would be just as good
7288 2018-10-17 13:55:06 Surprising hike in oil inventories pull prices lower, #WTI -1.35%
7289 2018-10-17 13:55:06 Another fun fact, truffle oil is actually just a type of formaldehyde.
7290 2018-10-17 13:55:06 Iraq is one of the world's largest producers of crude oil.  We did bomb them & send in the Marines.  Perhaps Saudi's longtime relationship w/the USD & oil most important?

7294 2018-10-17 13:54:31 Are we buying titles with oil money? Really? Having an owner from middle east doesn't mean oil money. Don't need their money. Just need ambitious owners.

7298 2018-10-17 13:54:22 A lot of people just use plain coconut oil but I've heard that can strip colour from your hair and given my hair is dyed atm I've avoided it.
7299 2018-10-17 13:54:13 Hmmm, you have never heard about “snake oil.”

Climate change is the best modern day example of this scam.
7300 2018-10-17 13:54:08 @joerogan what I would like to talk about are a few of my ideas, the theory behind them, how they work, why they disprove ideas about why they won’t work. And how they would help society ditch oil as a fuel and move forward to an all electric future.

7303 2018-10-17 13:54:04 What resources would those be? China is the leading producer is silicon used in solar panels and wind turbine companies are owned by overseas companies. Not to mention all renewable energy still uses oil and gas products.

7333 2018-10-17 13:51:33 It's very normal to have oil pass through the oil air seals in the engine, providing pressurised air for air con and pressure for environmental comfort. It's no big deal.

7335 2018-10-17 13:51:21 Well, no one is expelling Saudi diplomats at the moment or saying they will stop buying oil from them.

7337 2018-10-17 13:51:20 How do we deliver cooking oil to shops of people go “crazy” even before we offload? It’s now a risk to our delivery van drivers, merchandisers & sales staff! We really want to help and we are in production but this is counterproductive!akusebenzeki iqiniso lihle
7338 2018-10-17 13:51:16 I don’t understand how we come back from this. It’s beyond the pale. We seem to accept barbaric practices against their own citizens in exchange for oil. If that were not bad enough, now Kushner is involved with some deal that prevents 45 from speaking up? Horrifying.
7339 2018-10-17 13:51:10 @FabioRezendeFCS sharing our #cocoa #o&g and #fertilizers outlooks for Q4. Great questions from our guests about recent developments in #saudiarabia and how they will affect oil price behavior
7340 2018-10-17 13:50:59 I used ground chicken, onions, bell peppers, garlic powder, pepper, and season salt on mine! Mixed it with bread crumbs and cooked in olive oil! You can bake them or cook on top of the stove
7341 2018-10-17 13:50:46 Agreed. The Bush Administration couldn't go after the Saudis because they were in bed with them from a business perspective. We should have taken a harder stance against them then and we should do so now. We need to also slow/stop our dependence on Arab oil
7342 2018-10-17 13:50:35 There is no Saudi reform, its a paint job on an old car. However oil speaks louder then anything else. Who cares this so called country violates every norm of human decency and law.

7345 2018-10-17 13:50:22 In 71 Nixon took the US off the gold standard. He made a deal to protect Saudi Arabia them with the military in Exchange to use U.S. dollars for sale of its oil to prop up it's value artificially. If the US fux with the Saudis the US dollar takes a huge hit. #moreyouknow

7352 2018-10-17 13:49:54 Que? Who is leading the way in forming new source of energy? This is a marathon mentality. Right now all economies are tied at the hip to oil. U.S. has always seemed to position for oil and therefore dominate the narrative and game board. What about shifts? Vacuums created?

7363 2018-10-17 13:48:49 God has given the Saudi’s a great gift in the form of black gold; oil. They have misused this blessing and I believe God is soon to remove this from them. I don’t trust them!
7364 2018-10-17 13:48:49 Exactly, just another confirmation that cooking oil is now gold in our country.
7365 2018-10-17 13:48:48 Aaanndd, Congress will do nothing.  What do you expect, that they'll block all oil imports to punish whoever ordered the killing? Reject any multi-million dollar 'campaign donations'?  Sure, any day now.

7368 2018-10-17 13:48:15 Everyone is getting moral high ground about the Saudis butchering a journo but I bet they still drive their cars and use their home heating in this autumn weather. And if we excluded the Saudis from civilized world and oil prices went crazy they may come down off that moral hill.
7369 2018-10-17 13:48:09 Actually at $70 per barrel it’s very profitable in Alberta.  But the discount is massive because we can only sell to the USA.  So currently prices for the Alberta oil are around $20.  Not good for families here, great for the USA.

7371 2018-10-17 13:48:02 One of my classmates once referred to Saudi Arabia as "an oil field with a government." Yep. And this whole "Davos in the desert" thing is cute. Saudi Arabia won't exist in 50 years when the easy oil runs out.
7372 2018-10-17 13:48:00 I say let's stop paying Saudi Arabia for oil and start swapping them a barrel corn for a barrel of oil.

7412 2018-10-17 13:45:10 What is the difference between Russians in Salisbury and Saudis in Turkey? 
Arms and oil.
7413 2018-10-17 13:45:04 1. Kalo aku pake cetaphil/acnes dulu buat facewash lanjut yang toner organik itu soalnya itu ngandung apple cider vinegar kan ya? Terus air mawar, terus pilij salah satu dari 2 face oil abis pake oil pake aloe tapi bisa juga habis air mawar pake aole baru pake oil
7414 2018-10-17 13:45:02 he most certainly doesn’t hate oil workers. he traveled to every county in Texas and spoke directly to them and asked them what they actually wanted and he’s gonna do everything he can to help them.

7419 2018-10-17 13:44:39 Probably a dumb question, but is CBD Oil available in Canada today?

Different provinces not have it?
7420 2018-10-17 13:44:33 What would an embargo on Saudi oil look like?
7421 2018-10-17 13:44:31 Saudi Arabia could reduce Oil production (the U.S. is the third-biggest destination for Saudi crude, according to ClipperData. ) and inform Trump that that if he does not toe the line they will purchase arms from China / Russia...

7423 2018-10-17 13:44:25 Heating oil prices lower in their trading session this morning at 9:42 Eastern standard time 232.86 down -1.16 percentage loss of -0.50%. 
7424 2018-10-17 13:43:55 We're just now coming to this conclusion Doug? The Kingdom's hand was all over 9/11. We only liked them for oil and they spend tremendous amounts of money lobbying.
7425 2018-10-17 13:43:54 If you've been earning £150k+ as a decent oil equity analyst.......
7426 2018-10-17 13:43:51 #Commodities trading house @Trafigura reiterates its bullish view on #oil. " “We think upside risks are being underplayed,” Ben Luckock, co-chead of oil trading, says at @ArgusMedia conference. #OOTT #SaudiArabia #Iran
7427 2018-10-17 13:43:49 Burt’s does that to me as well  the one I’m using now is the essential oil brand Now. I think they all just have stuff in em that’ll keep you buying the product 
7428 2018-10-17 13:43:34 He could, but his "group of corrupt conmen" are more into COAL AND OIL than green energy!

7430 2018-10-17 13:43:18 thinking about oiling my nails like u would oil a tortoises shell seems like self care lol
7431 2018-10-17 13:43:03 what U think of this scenario
The Turkish & Iran are working hand & hand
November 412018 Saudi Arabia sales OIL & Iran Sanctions
The GLOBAL RESISTANCE for break the IRAN DEAL
LOTS OF SMOKE SCREEN DO NOT FALL FOR IT PEOPLE
IT THE GLOBALIST TO CONTROL TRUMP WITH IRAN SANCTIONS
7432 2018-10-17 13:43:03 We don't have to buy oil from them, we're not indebted to them for anything.
It would hurt them more than us if the US declines oil trade with them.

7456 2018-10-17 13:41:11 pompeo is falling so hard becoming the ultimate trump lackey after this whole saudi fiasco. I don’t think even oil magnate and sweetheart rex tillerson would be so submissive to the saudis. He needs to resign for failing to act as a true SoS.
7457 2018-10-17 13:41:05 that's because oil prices fell world wide.

fracking greatly increased supply of oil, especially in US
7458 2018-10-17 13:40:57 Truly we are pulling in the lifeblood out of the planet without any idea of the repercussions...
I would be all for removing oil in certain places say like around volcanoes or especially super volcanoes B wholesale removable everywhere seems ludacris...

7494 2018-10-17 13:37:40 I’ve tried both and oil is definitely less mentally intense, and probably better for during the day but the weed was fine also and I could easily go to the gym or something after smoking it, didn’t make me too tired as long as I wasn’t laying in bed
7495 2018-10-17 13:37:38 Mariana is so cute, she came down to see me on my lunch break JUST to tell me she spilt oil on her shirt, then disappeared wow
7496 2018-10-17 13:37:36 Did Venezuela not just move to the euro for oil trade? Guess the next smears followed by War from the Yanks...
7497 2018-10-17 13:37:32 Not one of those countries is a top ten exporter of oil. Not one. Economic competition comes from innovation and diversity. We won't become competitive through a resource that others produce at less cost and the world is moving away from.

7500 2018-10-17 13:37:28 Yup... like the "solar AND wind powered clothes dryer" I heard about - a.k.a. a clothes line.

The trick with carbon capture: how long will it stay captured? "In the soil" = back in the atmosphere soon. Will it stay captured as long & well as, say, buried coal or oil?
7501 2018-10-17 13:37:26 Well done, John. The science on health impacts of #fracking is indeed complex—as was the early science on lead paint and second-hand smoke—but some clear patterns exist: the closer you live to a oil/gas well, the higher your risk for certain health problems, esp during pregnancy.
7502 2018-10-17 13:37:23 BYE if I use hot sauce I'd be on the toilet the rest of the day lmaoo. I salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.
7503 2018-10-17 13:37:15 We have plenty of domestic production, but big oil exports it.  I look at it as they're selling OUR oil.
7504 2018-10-17 13:37:14 なるほど　なるほど
7505 2018-10-17 13:37:12 chilling in my smalloffice thinking where i can get cooking oil after wek
7506 2018-10-17 13:37:11 Starting 4th November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life. Modi magic transforming India!
7507 2018-10-17 13:37:07 Ah well. Mischief managed. Send that next shipment of oil please. :/
7508 2018-10-17 13:37:06 The fact that Mike Pompouspeo found time for a smiling photo op with these cold blooded murderers in Saudi Arabia is making me pretty sick.  #Kashoggi 

Funny how the Dems aren’t on @realDonaldTrump ‘s case over it.  They love Saudi oil $ and it’s payoffs just as much I guess
7509 2018-10-17 13:37:01 Hey Americans, are you ready to give up your oil addiction yet?

7512 2018-10-17 13:36:40 Yup.actually it's false Indians don't eat meat. Beef no no for most. Chicken, mutton, fish, eggs sure. But cooking involves oil use, carb consumption (biscuits/white bread etc) , sedentary lifestyle. And also starve or hog genetics supposedly.
7513 2018-10-17 13:36:40 @trespontasUSA I heard about you guys on @daringfireball's The Talk Show, but was wondering if there's any way to get the coffee and olive oil in Brazil. It would be very ironic if I had to buy it in the US on my next trip 
7514 2018-10-17 13:36:38 1/2 The single greatest global security threat in the world is oil.
It finances terrorism. Creates dictatorships and causes more human rights abuses than any other factor in life.

7530 2018-10-17 13:35:31 Ah...so MBS is guilty...maybe KK could share the court judgement with us?  How about telling us about the Saudi oil war on the US under Obama and what he did to punish SA?  Or 9/11...are Bush/Obama 'willing accessories' to Saudi actions?
7531 2018-10-17 13:35:20 And by actually being subsidized, it's estimated that 6.5% of global GDP goes to oil industies. The US is actually one of the less subsidized but that doesn't help when we by from places that are almost 100% subsidized.

If you’re a blind squirrel and Robert Francis O’Rourke is your Senator, you’re in luck.

If you’re a Texas hurricane victim or oil field worker, not so much.
7535 2018-10-17 13:34:46 Oh and coconut oil under my eyes. The face does feel a little tight where there’s aloe but it also feels soft to the touch and not heavy like Shea butter can sometimes feel

7537 2018-10-17 13:34:43 Just a reminder that the main reason the USA and Europe prop up Saudi Arabia is NOT because we depend so much on their oil, but because the rest of the world does and the royal armies of the Gulf monarchs are a cash bonanza for Western defense companies.
7538 2018-10-17 13:34:28 Beto not answering about his vote on oil tax. (He voted for it). The irony of oil well graphic behind him. LOL
7539 2018-10-17 13:34:12 Good to hear #fracking protesters freed on appeal with court recognising that original judge (with family links to oil industry) imposed "manifestly excessive" sentences.

7542 2018-10-17 13:33:55 Try coconut oil to let it get softer n the ends not to be so flaky.
7543 2018-10-17 13:33:50 If we put sanctions on the Saudis, and take away the weapons we are selling them, they can't go to a foreign country for more, certainly not in time to keep fighting the wars they are currently.

7546 2018-10-17 13:33:36 Whatever happened to the dismissive mockers who, earlier this year, so confidently ridiculed us for suggesting that the Shanghai oil contract would prove very attractive to oil exporters desirous of circumventing the petrodollar system?
7547 2018-10-17 13:33:36 What is your opinion on the benefits of fish oil after concussion?
7548 2018-10-17 13:33:35 Even the photoshoot? Baby oil n all?
7549 2018-10-17 13:33:20 Trump wanted to make the US self reliant by drilling for our own oil but progressive environments fuckers put a stop to that so yes, Trump must play ball with the Saudis because we rely on their oil.  So really whose fault is this? Can't have your cake and ear it too.

7561 2018-10-17 13:32:39 @JohnCornyn This is an old fantasy that actually has been harmful to the U.S. & the Western democracies, esp. when the Saudis have economically weaponized their oil to harm the West. The real question is why the West tolerated this from a small desert kingdom set up after WW1?

but unfortunately the economics are not there for these pipe dreams

7579 2018-10-17 13:30:57 The West formed an alliance with Saudi since its inception years and years ago. Saudi gives them oil and leverage in the Middle East. As for Iran, they nationalized the oil! As a Middle Easterner I believe this created schism is keep the region occupied and dependent
7580 2018-10-17 13:30:53 It's easier to for the public to believe it's Iran (but that really just because they are enemy of KSA and produce less oil). USA made deal with the devil in the 70's and now is stuck with defending these barbarians in order to price crude in USD

7598 2018-10-17 13:29:49 5). Let’s address this seriously with mitigation and security and response measures. This is indeed important but we can address.  In Canada if you spill 500ml of oil it requires remediation,....not in many places.  We can do this.
7599 2018-10-17 13:29:43 Anyone on here have opinions on CBD oil vs high CBD % flower? Curious as to the effects from someone who has tried both.
7600 2018-10-17 13:29:42 VanAuken:”Washington, which has forged an anti-Iranian axis with Riyadh and Israel, is counting on the Saudis to boost oil production to compensate for the cut-off of Iranian exports and thereby prevent a spike in oil prices and a potential global economic crisis.”

7605 2018-10-17 13:29:18 we HAVE to buy their oil - they know it - so they dont really care.  They re-invest those dollars all over the world and particularly the US.  Saudi dollars underpin a huge amount of monetary value in global GDP and their energy is a cornerstone of the world market. They own us.

7619 2018-10-17 13:27:36 Was the 1960s economy financialized as it is today? Reason this matters: all it took was an over leveraged #crudeoil to realize obvious supply imbalances as oil collapsed 75%

Maybe deficits matter if we'd expect funds to go all equity or cash. Bonds will be bought as it matters

7647 2018-10-17 13:25:32 I am lost in a children's playground. As I try to find my way out, i keep tripping in decaded machinery, oil leaks and other signs that the place is clearly malfuctioning.

7653 2018-10-17 13:24:57 The market solution is the one we have. The industry has no interest in upgrading their refineries.

The supply of oil, increased by fracking, makes it uneconomic. That won't change until easily refinable oil dries up

But this is not right.  1) yes private companies pay for foreign oil that they could buy from job creating local companies.  Which they would if it was available.  Or we could export on east

7670 2018-10-17 13:23:16 The truth is islamophobia is a FOX entertainment channel condition. Fear and hatred of Muslims is a mind conditioned illusion. Of course they control the oil reserves so they're chronic enemies. Saudis just sent $100 mil, and trump and kushner get along famously, just like always
7671 2018-10-17 13:22:58 No, you wouldn't see any oil if an internal seal went out. Oil would just pass by it and not actuate the cylinder, but would stay within the system.

7679 2018-10-17 13:22:36 His boss, Chas Koch, likely sent him over to help smooth out the scandal. Can't put oil profits at risk.

7684 2018-10-17 13:22:22 It boggles my mind how people can complain about work when there are women getting paid for videos of them rubbing themselves with oil or sucking on a dildo while pretending its their step brother (pov).

7702 2018-10-17 13:20:32 Hey, Ted.
Maybe we can get some cheap oil from your hair or your facial expressions.
7703 2018-10-17 13:20:31 No such thing as sustainable palm oil. All use and harvest of palm oil is damaging.
7704 2018-10-17 13:20:22 Last years high should be broken on good flows from brockham alone surly david... oil price much higher now and our production licence on the desk. .potential is huge from here.
7705 2018-10-17 13:20:22 I’m willing to put my neck on the line that most people rushing to buy cooking oil soon as it comes on the shelves in the shops aren’t buying it for consumption at home. Saw someone with tens of bottles selling out of his boot for bond or usd strictly. This country ka 
7706 2018-10-17 13:20:18 I would suggest buying some CBD oil. CBD is a powerful anti-inflammatory and pain killer. It is also really good for reducing stress and anxiety, without being intoxicating. I'd also suggest buying some high CBD weed to vape/smoke for faster relief.
7707 2018-10-17 13:20:16 Reports are that Saudi Arabia security force members carved up Khashoggi while he was still alive. It was all recorded on his iPhone watch. It took 7 minutes. But let’s keep Alberta Oil in the ground and continue to support this Draconian Regime.
7708 2018-10-17 13:20:16 It’s very biased in favor of center right, Oil & Gas positions.  Just this last week it endorsed Coffman and recently it came out against Amendment 73 for education.
7709 2018-10-17 13:20:14 Hey Texas, Robert Francis O’Rourke hates oil refinery workers and fracking but but but

he brought a blind one-legged squirrel back to life.

7718 2018-10-17 13:19:35 1. We don't import foreign oil. It is done by private oil companies.

2. Would it be better for Canada? Its uncertain since alot of tar sands are owned and controlled by foreign companies.

3. We don't import enough to impact world oil prices so there would be zero impact
7719 2018-10-17 13:19:33 I hate my brain. Before falling asleep I *suddenly* remembered the time I wore a new pair of boots to babysit a family for the first time 5 years ago and the boot wouldn’t come off my foot so the mom had to put olive oil on a paper towel to shimmy it off

7750 2018-10-17 13:17:08 I've been in Netherlands quiet often I haven't heard such cases (may be there are exceptional cases). There has to be educational campaign w.r.t Marijuana usge. CBD oil can replace painkillers in some cases.
7751 2018-10-17 13:17:06 What was productivity then...what was % of import to export/ local production...how much was in FR, Excess crude Acct, what was crude oil price and what was our production level,? All this needs answer so we can know where the problem came from
7752 2018-10-17 13:17:02 I've worked in the oil and gas industry for many years and several in the industry are well aware of global warming with fossil fuels playing as big a role as overpopulation and deforestation. Lobbyists are paid to lie.

I only do it because it uses less resources than cooking them in a pan, where you need oil or something.

Scotland doesn't really care all that much about barriers with UK.

7783 2018-10-17 13:15:13 Not true. Example- he said nothing on immigration except the port. The port is one - repeat one- factor. @tedcruz addressed all factors. Beto simply avoided the Oil/Gas issue. Those two factors alone drive most Texans to vote  #TeamCruz is my vote.

7815 2018-10-17 13:13:09 Oil is the only real choice. One of the biggest mistakes I think we make as Americans is trading “health” or worse convenience for pleasure and taste. Just eat in moderation. Oil and fat are not the enemy. Take the time to honor yourself. Eat well and be happy.
7816 2018-10-17 13:13:05 The fracking companies and their enablers should be charged. All oil exploration is contrary to human survival.
7817 2018-10-17 13:13:04 Oil's abit weaker today, wonder if its got anything to do with the US looking into the murder of #Khashoggi - Here you go Mr Trump, some lower oil prices for you just before your mid-term
7818 2018-10-17 13:12:49 Isn't the idea that basically they are a powerful status quo state in the region? The large ME state most anticommunist and willing to deal with Western powers?

Basically, a larger territory with lots of oil and autocratic government gave the leadership flexibility to negotiate?
7819 2018-10-17 13:12:31 he makes something simple like spirals, a mountain fault, oil and even the color red of the sweater terrifying!!! and best of all, no jumpscares!
7820 2018-10-17 13:12:30 US oil production reigns! Keep my cylinders pumping!  FYI FOX business is broadcasting Varney live from Whitehouse.
7821 2018-10-17 13:12:28 $21 Billion a month, can have quite a nice multiplier effect. That is what American Oil production is helping to do.

7828 2018-10-17 13:11:30 Some energy analysts are predicting that U.S. crude oil production will rise to near 14 million barrels per day by 2020, though infrastructure remains an issue.

7838 2018-10-17 13:11:05 16 month prison sentences for protesters climbing on lorries! Truly scandalous. Meanwhile, what happens to Judge Robert Altham after this sentence has been over-turned, described as "manifestly excessive", and judge's family links to gas and oil industries have been exposed?
7839 2018-10-17 13:11:00 That is why you see all the propaganda against EVs - they are doing the job now, and better in many ways than hydrogen could, and this is rather worrying for oil industry people.
7840 2018-10-17 13:10:51 Lol. 2 tablespoons of Olive oil produced by this one family on this tiny island in Greece that has been produced in this particular fashion for centuries. (Can substitute with trader Joe's extra virgin olive pil)

7864 2018-10-17 13:09:24 The problem with it is efficiency, and how it will be produced. It takes approx 4x electricity for each mile driven than an EV, which isn’t economical. Oil companies will happily produce it from natural gas at lower cost (business as usual for them) but with as much CO2 as petrol
7865 2018-10-17 13:09:18 OIL: Oil prices steadied after three days of gains after industry data showed a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories and tension over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist stoked supply worries.

7940 2018-10-17 13:02:15 We shouldn’t be in bed with autocracies because of dependence on oil. I’d rather walk. We enriched the Saud family by setting up Aramco and then becoming dependent on it.

7944 2018-10-17 13:01:47 Es evidente q no PERO, si vemos lo q hizo el partido de Toledo en el 2001, entró al gobierno y lo primero q hizo fue arreglar, en complicidad con PPK, como beneficiar a Hunt Oil, como lo denunció Dammert. Luego, ambos arreglaron con Odebrecht y ahi estas las coimas y pagos.

7952 2018-10-17 13:01:18 It’s a shame some government institutions don’t really believe in human induced climate change. Seychelles continues to search for oil and gas, in the hope of exploiting these resources, despite the effects this will have on our environment.

7965 2018-10-17 13:00:04 Yes, but the democratic government of Iran nationalised the British-US oil company that was taking all the oil. So the US backed a coup to install a dictator (the Shah). Who so repressive it led to a revolution... Iran has been punished ever since for not acquiescing.

8028 2018-10-17 12:54:29 I agree. Lobbyists are running our senate and house. Guns, insurance, who can vote, who can't, where to drill for oil.

8040 2018-10-17 12:53:33 Pretty good! A drop of machie oil on the joints and it handles smoothly after that. A bit heavy because it's pure metal though. But just as well since it survives the multiple drops this has went through.

8089 2018-10-17 12:49:40 Thousand of temporary jobs, only a handful once it’s up and running. It’s sad you don’t even mention the tribal communities that this pipeline passes through, it’s clear you don’t care about them as much as big oil.

8091 2018-10-17 12:49:28 High oil price, low $A, geopolitical tension creates equity market volatility which increases the cost of oil.

8094 2018-10-17 12:49:17 #ukog Price slowly drifting down due to lack of interest whilst compared to Angus, the bp remains too high.
Claims the HH acreage should value UKOG higher are invalid.The flow rate values the company : oil in the ground adds value, HH looks to have it built into today's price.

How to change a flat tire, change the oil in cars and jump start a car battery. It's my father, he was a mechanic and I watched him a lot while he worked on cars.
8099 2018-10-17 12:48:57 A big reason for Trump's accommodating stance toward Saudi rulers in the apparent killing of Jamal Khashoggi is rooted in oil politics.

The president needs more Saudi barrels on the market to offset the effects of his Iran sanctions.

8106 2018-10-17 12:48:09 Don't underestimate the politics of oil. It's been a thorn in every administration's side since the 1970's. This administration's policies seem more confusing than usual because Trump doesn't have the vocabulary to put forth a cohesive argument, even if it's spin.

8114 2018-10-17 12:47:40 No  they make it with palm oil in to stop it from melting (because summer is 9 months of 30+ degrees), which is understandable but it tastes like shit. There is places over here that sell english choc and I always stock up when I’m back

8123 2018-10-17 12:47:05 I prefer low THC with only.03% in CBD oil. There’s no euphoria, but countless health benefits.
8124 2018-10-17 12:47:04 In petroleum sector, most of the things are overly corrupt. Public & private oil companies have pocketed lakhs & lakhs of crores of rupees recently. Remember that Essar group & Reliance group are major donors for the BJP.

8226 2018-10-17 12:37:49 But if you look at our gas use, last year we used some 880TWh (trillion watt hours). The entire EU with wind, solar and biomass only generated 650TWh. We used another 800TWh in oil too. You could move all the renewables in the whole EU to the UK and not generate what gas we used.
8227 2018-10-17 12:37:48 Irving is hardly the only option.   There are imperial refineries in Sarnia and others.  Do you see the incredible $ losses Canadians are experiencing?  Do you accept where we are getting oil in the east?  Let’s address the environmental issues but stop the silliness.

8236 2018-10-17 12:37:00 That judge should have never been allowed near that case in the first place. First imprisonment of environmental protestors since 1932 and the judge has family in the oil and gas industry.
8237 2018-10-17 12:36:56 The Saudis, who have culpability for 9/11, are more trustworthy to our president than Christine Ford, black NFL players, and the NYT. How bout that oil money though.

"Must be the oil."
8242 2018-10-17 12:36:49 With respect, that last sentence is not true. Dronabinol is pure THC in a sesame oil carrier prescribed for intractable nausea from chemotherapy. Patients dislike it because without CBD undesired psychoactive effects are stronger, but not dangerous. All cannabinoids are medicine.
8243 2018-10-17 12:36:38 Sure we just wasted almost 50 years because oil companies pretended not to understand basic greenhouse gas effects, but I'm sure those same people will come up with effective and lasting ways of reengineering our entire climate.
8244 2018-10-17 12:36:34 I really like my oil mill team . So it will surely implode at some point
8245 2018-10-17 12:36:32 @CBCNews - at 6:30 am Oct 17th CBD Oil was still available on the OCS website.  By 8:30 am it was out of stock.

8250 2018-10-17 12:36:12 In some countries, they subsidize the service you get from using oil. E.g Transportation. So bus fares are cheap but the oil is not cheap.
8251 2018-10-17 12:36:09 If the majority of the citizens are poor, the country is absolutely poor. If you like, let there be oil wells in every street in the county, it is still absolutely still a poor country. Poverty resides with the people not with or without natural resources or potentials.
8252 2018-10-17 12:36:05 I wasn't real pleased with Beto's answer.  Clearly not wanting to say we need to transition away from oil and gas yesterday.  Trying to leave open the chance that oil and gas can coexist in the future with other alternatives.
8253 2018-10-17 12:36:04 For @realDonaldTrump and @jaredkushner, arms deals, oil, and potential real estate deals mean more than the principal of protecting free press and the lives of journalists.

8257 2018-10-17 12:35:46 Holding Saudi Arabia in line is much more important than a life. There is oil and then it's the heartland of 2 billions Muslims. Which action would you take as an American president?

8271 2018-10-17 12:33:11 Once the oil is gone theyll be back to tents and camel trains within a generation. Dubai etc will be derelict ghost towns. Property there is for speculation purposes only.
8272 2018-10-17 12:33:08 Because past presidents allowed the Saudis to get an ABSOLUTE STRANGLEHOLD on oil.. like driving that car? Like the military being able to mobilize? Until we have oil independence we're at a disadvantage. We need to be firm with them but careful

8295 2018-10-17 12:31:36 One of the things oil money has given KSA is a highly educated, and often frustrated, population, many of whom resent the restrictions under which they're condemned to live.  Don't write them off just because they've been oppressed for so long.
8296 2018-10-17 12:31:36 Actually the price of oil fell almost immediately, Venezuela's strongest economy was under Chavez, a socialist.

Plus, 70% of Venezuela's industry is privately owned by entrepreneurs, tell me again about how they're 'socialist'.

8299 2018-10-17 12:31:15 The closure of Sears and Roebuck has everything to do with Trump Bad economic policies. His tax cuts which benefits only top 1%, left no money in the hands of the Middle Class, and those below to stimulate demand and drive the economy. Talking points can only get you so far.

The idea that we should put oil and gas jobs today before our health and environment tomorrow is not logical. Not all jobs are created equal. O&G does more harm than good. We have the tech & resources to create renewable energy.

8339 2018-10-17 12:27:13 Partly because of where Saudi Arabia spends the money it gets from selling its oil.
And however much "deep thought" is given to whether or not the trade secretary should attend 'Doha in the Desert', the sad fact is that #Brexit makes it impossible for Britain to boycott it.

8379 2018-10-17 12:23:35 @aravindkumar Sure! You'll need to boil some water first, chuck some tamarind in there, let it become, well, tamarind water. Then some oil in a kadai, mustard seeds (wait for poppage), fenugreek seeds (don't let it brown), chopped onions (fry off for a bit), some sambhar powder
8380 2018-10-17 12:23:34 You have such a beautiful family. Hopefully, where your brother is now is a place where there is no pain, just love. May you have the oil of gladness that fills your heart as you think of the good times with your big brother.

8383 2018-10-17 12:23:26 The Oil price is cheaper than water. Why is the oil cheap while it opreate all of the Industry world wide. Everyone support his country and econmic. SAUDI SHOULD increace the prices up because Everyone take care of him self while we take care about Everyone except ourself.

8486 2018-10-17 12:14:17 The Saudis are not an oil rich country hence OPEC needing to control the oil market in the middle East. Turkey is the new Iran/Iraq debacle. Why let the United Nation Arab country control our oil markets on Wall Street? Nikki Haley needed to step down.

8489 2018-10-17 12:13:59 The government is not interfering with any of those things. The irvings as an example do not want tarsands oil. Its more costly to refine.

8511 2018-10-17 12:12:10 Nexus which is one of TYT's big donors wanted the oil pipeline in NOrth Dakota. Wes Clark jr got Nexus people to be out at STanding Rock. Nexus partnered w/ Michael's org at Standing R. They said one Native American woman abused her elderly mom & they got that woman Kathleen
8512 2018-10-17 12:11:58 To get my oil changed
8513 2018-10-17 12:11:57 So id be surprised if you can save more than 2.5TCO2 even assuming zero carbon elec and assuming some CO2 from oil refinery process etc; unless you were previously driving large car with high CO2 emissions. But your point about it being a relatively quick/easy CO2 gain is valid
8514 2018-10-17 12:11:56 We need oil alternatives now.

8516 2018-10-17 12:11:41 I hope their is no Palm Oil in any of these KITKAT 
8517 2018-10-17 12:11:39 @LBC  Nothing will happen in the world's relationship with Saudi Arabia. All they have to do is turn off the taps, and oil could shoot up to $400 a barrel. That would be economic suicide for the whole world.
8518 2018-10-17 12:11:38 OIL  always has and always will intill the reserve runs out and the USA will drop them so fast like Democrats and MSM media did to Dr. Ford when she was no longer needed! FACTS
8519 2018-10-17 12:11:33 I though stuff like CBD oil is still a year away and its just different types of hippie lettuce right now?

ps
oii ...you been to 'His*tan*bull with your shake*spear lens+bullet proof skin oil ? locals there don't like people sniffing 'round' in street ...they got DOGS for that

mosquitoes bite - bees sting
8523 2018-10-17 12:11:23 I suppose that's how you square the circle. Can't really do oil extraction properly if you think god put it there 6,000 years ago
8524 2018-10-17 12:11:19 Sad that the fracking bill in Colorado probably won’t pass. Oil and gas has lead a dishonest campaign against it. The amount of fear mongering ads and payoffs going on is despicable.
8525 2018-10-17 12:11:10 $CL_F already did a 3 waves back at the blue box area & bouncing. If did a 7 then should see buyers at next blue box area #Elliottwave #OIL
8526 2018-10-17 12:11:02 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8527 2018-10-17 12:11:01 Just has the best massage in my life at the hotel. However, didn't have time to wash off the oil... I'm now stinking of lavender....
8528 2018-10-17 12:10:49 Nothing like faith in America Rand. You guys just love to totalitarian governments. Oil for us weapons for them. Maybe we should have to be responsible for how they use them and the destruction they caused
8529 2018-10-17 12:10:42 America has yet to retaliate against Saudi Arabia over 911, recent Yemen bombings, and will continue to do nothing about the #jamalkhashoggi murder. The Deep State's love affair with Saudi money & oil will continue. #megamillion #MannyMachado #NLCS #WorldMentalHealthDay
8530 2018-10-17 12:10:37 @SenTedCruz Anyone who thinks windmills and solar panels are Texas’ largest jobs and energy producers is a complete flake...he loves to ride his skateboard...he hates the oil and gas industry...Texans, he is a joke...
8531 2018-10-17 12:10:31 You are blaming people who are trapped in a manufacturing squeeze where #oilandgas showers our government with money to make sure people don't have many choices. 1st the general public needs to fully understand the problem and get oil money out of government.
8532 2018-10-17 12:10:28 Sure,  we can feel that way in 20 years time by just hopping in bed with that Abu Dhabi Oil $$$$$ also.
8533 2018-10-17 12:10:28 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
8534 2018-10-17 12:10:27 The oil exploration in the North what did it yield, please? I’m asking for my fellow Nigerians...
8535 2018-10-17 12:10:24 You'll immediately notice price inflation - especially for electricity, heating oil, gas/petrol & other carbon-intensive products & services. You'll quickly see long term investment in low/zero carbon infrastructure & products. You'll see share prices of fossil fuel corps drop.

8537 2018-10-17 12:10:06 Historical records have people start using hot oil for both cooking and warfare at nearly the same time. Someone either burned themselves while cooking and said "You can do this to other people" or burned someone alive and said "Damn that smells good."

8540 2018-10-17 12:09:51 They cannot raise the price of oil without hurting themselves much more than they hurt us. Their only weapon is to reduce their own production. No one else in OPEC will follow them. 2/
8541 2018-10-17 12:09:49 You used the word "thinking"
Associated with a Trump supporter. Kinda like oil & water....#ijs the answer is a resounding NO!
8542 2018-10-17 12:09:44 They have the world's largest oil reserves and they can't even produce their own gasoline ffs. You are kidding yourself if you don't think this is the result of socialism making them weak. Its pathetic.
8543 2018-10-17 12:09:43 Cannabis affects different people differently due to various hereditary and other factors, so err on the side of caution. Also, learn to infuse vegetable oil with cannabis and make brownies from a mix. Easy and a good (some would say the best) way to absorb THC & CBD.

8545 2018-10-17 12:09:39 @KSAmofaEN Looking forward to your oil fields drying up and your horrendous failed state that has no respect for human rights or decency is torn to the ground. MBS (Mr. Bone Saw) is gonna be dragged through the streets, beaten, and sodomized with a bayonet like Gathafi.
8546 2018-10-17 12:09:33 What's with this sudden cooking oil Gold Rush, is it in the running as an alternative currency. I foresee a nation battling high cholesterol induced illnesses further increasing demand for  medication....a vicious cycle.
8547 2018-10-17 12:09:32 Oh really, is it done by Saudi. How sad. There a rich country. All the oil. They should be happy people. Some are so beautiful.

8553 2018-10-17 12:08:17 Whether this threat was made as such is disputed, but to my mind the mere speculation that it was is a turning point. #EU populations still remember the #oil #boycott by #OPEC during he #YomKippur war. #SA is losing any #softpower rebuilt since rapidly.

8557 2018-10-17 12:07:57 The court of appeal have acted to overturn the draconian sentence imposed on the 3 fracking protestors, by judge Robert Altham. The judge has been accused by many, of acting on behalf of his family interest, his sister owns a supply business for the oil and gas industry.

8559 2018-10-17 12:07:21 how come with all these agencies generating a total of ₦3.9 trillion, without even adding the $28 billion (₦10 trillion) Nigeria made from oil and gas this year, that we can’t fund the 2018 budget of only ₦8.6 trillion and have to massively borrow?

8562 2018-10-17 12:06:51 You might think so. But French fries go from freezer to hot oil. Only time I have a problem with that is when they sit out a while and a lot of ice crystals form. That's a mess. The popcorn doesn't seem to gather the crystals.
8563 2018-10-17 12:06:18 But of course he does. Everywhere you look, oil people are seeing their fortunes threatened. And they don't care about you or me.
Or their own children and grandchildren, apparently.
8564 2018-10-17 12:06:16 Most def getting an oil change today
8565 2018-10-17 12:06:01 This is commendable, it is high time for our petroleum depots and other stakeholders to rise up to certain responsibilities in repositioning the oil sector.

8572 2018-10-17 12:04:46 At the time price of fuel was increased to N145/ litre, crude oil was selling for =< $40/ barrel. 
Crude oil current sells for ~$80/ barrel. Meaning double the price it was about two years ago. 
It’s either we increase PMS to about N270/ litre or the govt has to “subsidize”.
8573 2018-10-17 12:04:34 Concerned about our back four. Responsibility and Nationhood could struggle against their front four. Also worried that both oil and gas wealth are not the strength they once were.
8574 2018-10-17 12:04:25 di shopee oxy ada yg 85k  tapi jadi pengen beli tea tree oil juga deh :(
8575 2018-10-17 12:04:17 Oh and as for the oil tax I think it was a way to force the transition towards renewable energy and a way to prevent reliance on oil (so it can be used less and have a better effect on the environment)
8576 2018-10-17 12:04:17 2500 ft is less than 1/2 a mile its about a city block so I'm not surprised people don't want the oil and gas companies to drill in their front yard they want them to drill down the road
8577 2018-10-17 12:04:13 Export oil while importing everything else. Relied imports while destroying domestics industries. Once export stop, so does import; the absence of domestic industries when export halt inflate every common goods, root cause to what Venezuela is today.

And deny global warming.

8639 2018-10-17 11:58:48 Fuel price is actually a function of price of crude oil and the exchange rate of Naira to Dollars. 
The higher the price of crude oil, the higher the cost of purchasing refined products (since we import most of the refined products comsumwd local)

8642 2018-10-17 11:58:37 Seeing how we here in Colorado have only seen ads against 112 I would say that it's the oil and gas companies who are spending billions of dollars to stop a bill that would require oil and gas companies to drill less than half a mile from somebody's home school or Hospital

8644 2018-10-17 11:58:27 As a registered psychotherapist my approach to a client coming to session high is the same as someone coming drunk. Don't do it. CBD oil for medical reasons including of course severe trauma, but otherwise, we can't work on anxiety or depression or much else when you're stoned.

8653 2018-10-17 11:57:21 I think it smells disgusting. You couldn't pay me to smoke a joint. I've debated using the oil for pain treatment- but I'd never smoke it. I don't care if other people do- I'm the same with cigarettes. Can't stand the smell- don't get the hype.

8665 2018-10-17 11:56:10 I've had people who sell CBD oil recommend the vape oil, which are made with glycols. Absolutely clueless, know nothing about what they are selling!

The glycols turn into oxalic acid in the blood doing more damage than any benefit from the CBD
Oxalic acid is used to clean rust
8666 2018-10-17 11:56:01 We cannot continue to burn coal and oil. There is no such carbon capture technology anywhere on the horizon. It's a myth, like clean coal, propagated by the fossil fuel industry. Same with research into new algae based fuels. It's a way to keep humanity buying energy from them.

8675 2018-10-17 11:54:36 Wonderful news that the three anti-fracking activists have been freed by the court of appeal. There needs to be an inquiry into the judge who originally convicted them and his questionable family ties to investment in the oil and gas industry.

8684 2018-10-17 11:53:49 So how are you doing on that whole "selling Canadian oil for less then $20 a barrel while the rest of the world sells at $75" thing?
8685 2018-10-17 11:53:46 Oil prices and Rafale probably.
8686 2018-10-17 11:53:41 God did it.He opened to eyes to see that, as a believer, I’m constantly in a battle and that it glorified the devil to see me depressed; He made me understand that, on the cross, He paid the price for my continual happiness and that the oil of gladness was upon me.
8687 2018-10-17 11:53:35 You are right.  Gov should step out of the way and allow businesses to transport Canadian oil so other businesses can refine Canadian oil, so Canadians can benefit and perto dictators can’t.  Pipelines protesters are supporting the worst regimes in the world.

8708 2018-10-17 11:50:19 And the BBC know full well that the U.S and U.K don’t want to lose their precious arms or for the Saudi’s to raise the price of oil.

8727 2018-10-17 11:47:28 I’ve been saying my entire adult life, we need to be off of ME oil. We need to convert to North American products and transition to renewables for political and environmental reasons.
8728 2018-10-17 11:47:28 Sounds like a great plan. Press down on the throat with your heel of an already impoverished nation.  Too bad they don’t have oil. Then you could turn a blind eye to all their transgressions while sending them billions of dollars.
8729 2018-10-17 11:47:25 Lol, housing is expensive in any large city, not just San Fran. Homelessness is a prob in most large cities b/c govs do nothing substantial about affordable housing crises. Transportation projects are not same as privatizing oil companies.

8775 2018-10-17 11:43:05 No Russia is still an issue since they own the White House.  Saudi Arabia has been a problem for a long time and we have allowed then to have us over a barrel with oil.  So they have been brazen and murdered a resident of the United States knowing that Trump is a neutered dog
8776 2018-10-17 11:42:46 Naw..... you wouldn’t wanna buy more of that dirty oil from Canada then, eh?

We fuck you over with trade.
8777 2018-10-17 11:42:38 You know how it smells outside after it rains? There's a word for that: Petrichor is the distinct scent of rain in the air.  It’s the name of an oil that’s released from the earth into the air before rain begins to fall. 
8778 2018-10-17 11:42:28 Going to be selling that at work soon, can probably get you an online discount code. The oil is currently listed with homeopathy etc as we can sell it but can't say it'll work...
8779 2018-10-17 11:42:19 The US should have nothing to do with the Saudis.  This will be a good time for us to develop and use other sources of energy.  We should not buy another barrel of oil from any of the OPEC countries.  We have the technology to move beyond fossil fuels.  RIP Khashoggi

8784 2018-10-17 11:41:50 @tedcruz - for as smart as you think you are, you are living in the past. May be you should have taken a horse ride to the debate.  Wake up, oil & gas is OLD, Solar and Wind are new.  Stop taking money from the PAC's and act and work for Texans.
8785 2018-10-17 11:41:23 If we're going to go after Saudi Arabia, then our country needs to be energy independent first and foremost. They are the largest producer of oil, and also have there finger on the pulse of practically everyone's economy.

8816 2018-10-17 11:38:20 That it is :-(. To blatantly kill a man with the world watching shows little fear of the consequences. Oil and money talk and with enough of it you can do whatever you want as the world turns a blind eye.

8820 2018-10-17 11:38:10 .@CENTCOM was created to defend Middle Eastern oil (Saudi Arabia). The paranoia of the Cold War made US leaders believe that the Soviets were going to race across Iran to seize Gulf oil following the invasion of Afghanistan.

8856 2018-10-17 11:33:49 There's still another 50 years of oil at least. Since 1980 (when I was born), ppm CO2 has increased by 65. This is a bigger rise than from the start of the industrial revolution to when I was born 230 years later. What do you think will happen in the next 37 years?!?!

8858 2018-10-17 11:33:26 If you actually believe Trump’s “guilty until proven innocent” comment on Saudi Arabia, you’re wrong. KSA is an evil regime and we basically turn a blind eye to their atrocities as long as they sell oil in US dollars. This was an assassination of a dissident. Plain and simple.

8912 2018-10-17 11:27:38 Petroleum coke (not to be mistaken with Coca Cola), used in specialty carbon products such as certain types of electrodes, is a derivative of crude oil.

8915 2018-10-17 11:26:59 Damn, Canadians are enjoying o! Cannabis is now legal!! If Nigeria adopts the regulated sale of Cannabis, a lot of money would be made. Its a very high selling product just after oil and Gas. But d cons, a lot of mad people will spring up soon in Canada.
8916 2018-10-17 11:26:57 Bio oil mantul gak? Aku sekarang jerawatan dan aku pakein bio oil tapi kayak gak ngaruh apa apa:(

Terus kalo ditaro di alis juga bisa numbuhin alis kak, di aku gitu soalnya. Bisa jadi cleansing oil juga kalo susah ngapus make up. Tp ini bukan buat dimasak ya ka
8919 2018-10-17 11:26:51 3. As long as Govt control and Own PSUs they would abuse. MMS/Chidambaram abused OIL companies by not raising petrol/diesel prices. BJP too would do it by extracting dividend,Buybacks and cross Holdings. So privatise.

8922 2018-10-17 11:26:24 Hello Lizzie, we don't actively add Palm Oil to our recipes but it is present in the sub-ingredients of a very small amount of our meals. We always ensure with our suppliers that it's from RSPO approved, sustainable sources and avoid its use where possible.
8923 2018-10-17 11:26:04 It is the first steps of taking control of your Oil like you big brother Saudi Arabia as always been doing with his Oil and it is the road to profitability and to a better future for the people of Irak with this gift from God.

8930 2018-10-17 11:24:50 Non of those countries had the oil influence Saudi has
8931 2018-10-17 11:24:48 And you're just going to accept his response at face value? Surely American reliance on Saudi oil can't be that bad can it?

8935 2018-10-17 11:24:22 We import 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia, 7% from Iraq 40% from Canada 7%from Venezuela 7% from Mexico.  We import 10.14 mil. barrels a day, but we export 3.77 mil. barrels a day.  Why do we need midle eastern oil?

8940 2018-10-17 11:23:32 Definitely it's important.
It reduces instances of machine wear and tear, over heating problems, Clogging of fuel/Oil systems.

8946 2018-10-17 11:23:04 *Insert U.S. administration*: "We stand against terrorism and human rights abuses, whoever commits them! Now, Saudi Arabia, can we have some oil and continue relations please?"
8947 2018-10-17 11:22:29 and we still accept their oil??????
8948 2018-10-17 11:22:26 I thought it was an impressive win! I figured if the oilers made it 4-3, the Jets would pull away and finish them off. But that didn’t happen. Yes, Winnipeg did push back but this time Oil able to stand their ground. Talbot also made that breakaway save too
8949 2018-10-17 11:22:03 Aku awal mau beli bio oil juga.. Aku kira hargae d bawa 100rebu..eeh yg kecil hargae 200rb..

8951 2018-10-17 11:21:30 This is a good reason to support electric vehicle technologies, adaptation and individual procurement.  Less demand for oil=Less money for Saudi

8954 2018-10-17 11:21:10 by 2050 the world will have turned its back on oil, so that means Scotland will have made less than fuck all from it while in the UK, instead of used its decline to fund alt fuel use and a NFP sovereign energy company , and more by selling in Scots pound instead of dollars.
8955 2018-10-17 11:21:04 HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THIS SITUATION PRES JOE JOE?  PROTECT THE WORLD'S OIL INTEREST LIKE ALL OTHER PRESIDENT'S BEFORE, OR SANCTION THE HELL OUT OF THEM FORCING OIL PRICES HIGHER..HUMAN LIFE FOR OIL? 911 WAS BAD ENOUGH!

8958 2018-10-17 11:20:56 I actually voted against it. We've been promised by politicians that they would increase education funding through taxes on drilling for oil and gas here. That hasn't happened. I don't believe they'll follow through with this proposition either.
8959 2018-10-17 11:20:45 Well you tell us,as under your presidency & with Khamenei's blessing millions continued to suffer while you guys sent money and free oil to Syria, Hizbollah and shia militias in Iraq. Don't acr like your Gandhi now, you won't even qu6as his janitor

8982 2018-10-17 11:17:58 The Saudi Arabia issue is quite complex, I fully support the human rights agenda 100% but who owns those largest reserves of oil and we can't deal with constant hikes, so there are a number of factors to consider here, heinous killing can't be condoned, absolutely not

8998 2018-10-17 11:16:17 Federal spending is only part of the issue.  The tax cut was to stimulate the economy and create new revenue.   Instead, the tax cut allowed a surge in oil and gas prices which has rippled through the economy.   Oh, the tariff war has not helped either...

/heavily sweating oil.
9001 2018-10-17 11:15:45 The more intelligent question would have been how much was crude oil when PDP came in, how come we buy fuel more expensively at a period crude oil was supposedly cheap?
9002 2018-10-17 11:14:54 .@Morning_Joe We ignored the Saudi role in 9/11.
Why is anyone surprised that we will ignore the death of a journalist? 
Oil and military sales have always trumped human rights.
9003 2018-10-17 11:14:50 I audibly moaned with pleasure watching a cooking show about olive oil. What up?
9004 2018-10-17 11:14:48 You live in Harrumph? Is this a metaphorical "harrumphville" or a town called "Harrumph"?

Canada has some great historical place names that let you know it's a resource rich country. Coppermine. Asbestos. Uranium City. Petrolia. Oil Springs.
9005 2018-10-17 11:14:47 As much as I wish the oil is correct. (Can’t wait to see them gone). Polls seem to count for very little lately.  There is bias and mis information invikved in the polls.  So I don’t trust them much any more (they just seem surprised after the fact)

9011 2018-10-17 11:14:03 Box be slippery...like tryna walk on oil
9012 2018-10-17 11:13:55 "I'm afraid simply living up to your obligations on that old $110B arms-deal isn't going to be enough, this time. You're going to facilitate the doubling of our strategic oil reserves." Sounds like James Bond dialogue, right?

9018 2018-10-17 11:12:59 Can I ask Mr.mody prime minister of India, why increase oil and natural gas price very high.
9019 2018-10-17 11:12:54 Disgusting. Tell Saudi to keep their blood money. If they want to jack the price of oil up to $200 a barrel we can start selling Iran F 35s and wish them the best of luck.
9020 2018-10-17 11:12:48 LOL. O'Rourke tried to play Trump but his voting history shows he is a fraud. He voted for example for a tax on oil. Total loser

9040 2018-10-17 11:09:29 Well that brings new meaning to the phrase " im no oil painting. But in your case your a hottie.
9041 2018-10-17 11:09:23 ถ้าดีมันจะแฮปปี้มาก
9042 2018-10-17 11:09:19 They are our enemy but that damn oil is so precious and so is the revenue it brings. Human is expendable.
9043 2018-10-17 11:09:14 Here’s a crazy idea...since some say we need Saudi Arabia for keeping the oil flowing and keeping Iran in check how about we move aggressively towards alternative energy so we won’t have a Secretary of State SMILING LIKE AN ASS AS HE MEETS WITH THE GUY WHO ORDERED THE MURDER
9044 2018-10-17 11:08:54 LINE。。。お前死んだのか。。。！？
9045 2018-10-17 11:08:50 Always remember; the KSA gets all its weaponary from the West and they can shut off the Supply at any time; thereby making KSA impotent in Arms.
Remember the Oil Crisis?....USA,UK AND France were prepared to take control of their Oil.
9046 2018-10-17 11:08:37 Lol trump can't never cut ties with Saudi , he need oil money social media president
9047 2018-10-17 11:08:31 Well, he doesn’t want oil prices to skyrocket, riiiiiight?
9048 2018-10-17 11:08:30 US stock futures are down 0.3% with Asia positive and Europe mixed.  Oil is $71.51 with gold at $1,231. A second cup of coffee may help explain this.  After one cup, it seems the markets are listening closely to earnings results every morning to set the direction for the day.
9049 2018-10-17 11:08:25 Smelled like burnin oil.
9050 2018-10-17 11:08:24 Correct .The Parliament is packed with billionaires who are interested in advancing their own interests. The days when MPs burnt.their midnight oil to stydy issues and prepare speeches gave gone.The age of Idiots has taken over that  age.
9051 2018-10-17 11:08:11 I would tell OPEC to shove it we are a Natural Gas and Oil independent but because of the Saudis we are forced to pay at the pump.

9054 2018-10-17 11:07:57 Please stipulate that the bacon should be grilled and preferable to cook your eggs in water. I substitute water for oil when cooking eggs. Grill a large tomato too and that will give you lycopene which will be beneficial too. Fuller for longer with this breakfast, no snacking
9055 2018-10-17 11:07:56 Regime in Riyadh propped up the regime in Washington for decades by selling their oil in US Dollars. Petrodollars have financed wars all over the world.
9056 2018-10-17 11:07:54 @bbmhlanga can you show us those full shops we want to but the precious oil.
9057 2018-10-17 11:07:53 Iwe Mati the cooking oil bottle was the precursor to the trigger that brought me back to those nightmares of t  hyper inflation years. I just could not sleep honestly. So let me eat my fried food pandinodira if that makes me happy. I just want my kitchen flooded with cooking oil

9062 2018-10-17 11:07:01 @FuzzyTaco75 Cruz reliance on oil money assures Texans of a polluted coast line, roads collapsing from water and oil trucks due to fracking, polluted air, future mass shootings due to lack of background checks.

9064 2018-10-17 11:06:38 Nah I was too slow off the mark, sadly...claiming "oor oil" revenue is really worth £469bn a year! Utterly batshit crazy. Not her fault, she's one of the ones taken in by the really bad guys.

Interestingly, Stewart Hosie follows her!!!
9065 2018-10-17 11:06:29 Saudi Arabia and Israel becomes terror states but the world political bodies overlooking these issues because military and oil power it seems
9066 2018-10-17 11:06:24 I have no idea why you are defending one of the most brutal and corrupt bukybiys if the Middle East. Just because your president cosies up with them to ensure that oil keeps flowing, doesn't mean they aren't trying to control the whole region. Read up on middle Eastern politics

9073 2018-10-17 11:05:55 The situation during your tenure is far worst.We know how much money you made from crude oil sales in 8yrs and We also known how much you left behind in FAC+ECA. We also know how you corrupt the NAS with money to alter the Constitution but you failed.

9109 2018-10-17 11:00:59 Great article - will show it to all the people who ask me about the new liquid coconut oils we can buy. Where I live, normal coconut oil is like rock in winter,  only becomes soft enough to spoon out in summer and is never liquid!

9125 2018-10-17 10:59:58 Where there are no facts, people try to provoke a mud-fight.

9160 2018-10-17 10:55:23 When my dad was working in oil tankers, he told me how the Saudis developed more civilized punishments. Instead of public stonings, they would leave the condemned in a low spot and have a truck back up and dump large rocks on them.

9169 2018-10-17 10:54:18 So @AberdeenFC can't shift the tickets they asked for after crying into their oil about the kick off time. Most pathetic club in Scotland, serial bottle merchants and part time fans. Wanks.
9170 2018-10-17 10:54:15 @claireperrymp 
Richard Roberts and Simon Blevins sentenced to 16 months and Rich Loizou to 15 months for non-violent protest against fracking which is proven to harm our environment. 

Judge Robert Altham who jailed them has family links to oil and gas firms.
How will you help?
9171 2018-10-17 10:54:14 Sadly, it is not just trumpty & crew. The last several presidents have also 'supported' them.
If the Saudis cut off our oil, this country comes to a screeching halt, and the Saudis know that. We are too dependent on oil.

9177 2018-10-17 10:53:14 Hello, we have spoken to Cadbury who are part of the Palm Oil roundtable. They only use sustainable palm oil and are working to reduce their usage. Thank you.
9178 2018-10-17 10:53:05 If your cooking oil bottle loses you sleep, my friend, that’s a feudal problem you need to graduate from. It’s a state of mind. Start by thinking that cooking oil is not so good for health .
9179 2018-10-17 10:53:04 The Saudi #Wahabbis are the 'devils in disguise' that the West worship because they have Petro dollars! Just 45 years ago, they were worth nothing, until one Harvard educated "Sheikh Yamani" (88) convinced #OPEC to quadruple (4x) price of crude oil. Rest in peace #JamalKhashoggi

9184 2018-10-17 10:52:29 You've panic tweeted something like a dozen attempts to deflect from an article about George Papadopoulos's wife committing fraud and his family's statements about her. You have simply proven that the article struck oil to cause such troll panic. #TrumpRussia

9186 2018-10-17 10:52:16 Oil prices are often a function of expected economic activity and/or an Administration’s policies toward oil.  

Obama’s record of (expected) growth was terrible, as was his hostility toward oil.  

Trump is trying to grow us into less serious structural economic problems.

9196 2018-10-17 10:51:15 Oil is dying. We need renewable energy. Oil is not infinite.
9197 2018-10-17 10:51:12 Leading the world away from oil would enhance the economic well being of our country and it's national security.
9198 2018-10-17 10:51:04 Once I read it, I couldn’t look at a Baku oil field without seeing the novel’s famous fight scene between the rival lovers taking place.
9199 2018-10-17 10:50:42 I think identifying as Republican and Democrat is passé. Nationalists and Globalists are more suitable definitions today.
9200 2018-10-17 10:50:33 @realDonaldTrump but I promise not to reach their goal because it is an anti-Globalist president in the White House. On November 4, Iran's oil will be cut off completely, Suef will stop its services to Iran and the global financial system will be cut off on this regime

Aloe vera gel and coconut oil are my fav beauty products 
9237 2018-10-17 10:44:42 I don’t think a lot of people realize that. College is a scam. You could literally learn most things on YouTube now. Most companies just catch trends and build businesses around them. It’s like catching the gold rush or finding oil and creating a brand and name to sell it.
9238 2018-10-17 10:44:40 So I saw an attack ad recently that said Beto is raised taxes for oil and wants to cut use of natural gas (or something along those lines).

9250 2018-10-17 10:42:16 Trump isn't being bamboozled. He knew the Saudis were savages during his campaign. He doesn't want to destabilise Saudi Arabia and weaken his hand against Iran. Or raise the price of oil, or risk American jobs.

9269 2018-10-17 10:40:00 it doesn't. the idea is to reduce dependence on oil, not eliminate it altogether. altria (formerly philip morris) sells mac & cheese and oreos now. i think they have something like half a billion dollars in non-tobacco revenue.

9282 2018-10-17 10:38:36 Russia and China will be buying Venezuelan oil and helping right that ship. Both have gold reserves allowing them to create a true gold backed currency with enough firepower behind it to derail the Petrodollar. Not today or tomorrow but soon enough.

9284 2018-10-17 10:38:25 There will still be the oil exchanges denominated in USD and now RMB. Some might change in time. XRP of course will be the bridge asset between all, so no need to keep USD on reserve to pay for energy imports.

9292 2018-10-17 10:37:29 True, but i dont think they would need to cut ties with iran to be the number 1 in the middle east. also, i dont think the US is leaving SA soon, they have influence and they buy their weapons (sell them oil too)
9293 2018-10-17 10:37:29 Personally I back u. Anyone with the human rights violations the Saudis have they shud be kept as far away from the club as possible. Where does the money come. Oil, arms, subsidies from the uk for not providing aid to the Yemen. Sorry  no. Instead ill watch @buryfcofficial
9294 2018-10-17 10:37:28 Losing my shit. Told my team I didn’t want to see them so they come to the house. Moan at me for being in bed when I’ve told them I’ve had to take the day off work as a precaution as I’d been exposed to toxic gas & oil because of a leak at work and I had been sick twice

9307 2018-10-17 10:35:33 Generally yes it does say 'Sustainable' if it is Sustainable. An example is Burgens bread which will say sustainable palm oil in the ingredients

9325 2018-10-17 10:32:28 I agree with over reliance on petrol chemicals but it's still down to our government selling them arms. Doesn't matter where their money comes from. Other countries use their oil but don't sell them weapons. Why should we?

No need for palm oil we have hemp oil. Nature first not corporate industries
9333 2018-10-17 10:31:41 Nigeria is one of the most developed countries in Africa. Total gdp distributed as follows: Services is the largest(50%- fastest growing information&communications), Agriculture(23%), crude petroleum&gas(11%), Industry&construction(16%).  So oil reliance is going down.

9337 2018-10-17 10:30:42 Putting “oil” on people’s foreheads. That’s like a magic potion or something? What’s highly ironic is that they’d condemn “sorcery” or anything related to “witchcraft” but they do this practice. Projection at its finest.

9343 2018-10-17 10:30:11 It was so painful 
 I had to pack the remaining potatoes and put them in  the waste bin and waited till the oil became very hot. I never fried potatoes on a low heat after that day .It drinks oil lol.
9344 2018-10-17 10:29:56 it’s SO SO good i could go on abt it for HOURS. it only dries out the area you put it on. like if you put it on a pimple it’ll dry the oil out and there’s something in it that reduces swelling so that it’ll look dramatically different when you take it off.

9367 2018-10-17 10:26:38 This is absolutely horrid! If Trump is so worried about the money and/or the oil, how about we go to solar & wind energy then we won't need their oil. Of course, Trump can't line his pockets that way! His lack of concern about this is inexcusable!
9368 2018-10-17 10:26:27 @jonathanelscpt Whereas scientists funded by oil companies are totes objective, right? And even though Trump keeps defunding climate scientists for their inconvenient findings, they still say man-made climate change is real. Which kinda makes you look silly. And dishonest.

9379 2018-10-17 10:24:11 Relations end when respect is lost. Friendships suffer when respect is lost. Respect is an oil that runs the engine. Respect not as a friend or partner but respect as a human being . The ability to see your partner/friend as a child of God and human being is the basis of respect.
9380 2018-10-17 10:24:06 Please explain the £469 billion oil revenue? 
How much of this then turns into profit?
How much corporation tax does that profit  then generate for the Scot Gov?
9381 2018-10-17 10:24:05 Soaring inflation is not caused by higher spending alone but could be "neutralize" by raising interest rates thus lower spending. Having said that, soaring inflation is caused, directly and indirectly, by many factors like weakening peso, high global oil prices, bad taxes & more.
9382 2018-10-17 10:23:28 Any type of oil and fat is not good for you if you consume too much of it

9397 2018-10-17 10:20:56 Oil is renewable. The earth makes it. Didn’t you know that? It continues to make it constantly when organically break down
9398 2018-10-17 10:20:46 Truth is there are 7.1 million Job openings If you do not like your job look for another one that pays better So what so oil is up over $10 a barrel During Obama it was over $100 a barrel So you can say it is down more than $35 since Trump took office

Di tulad dati umabot ng lampas $100 oil pero na mimitigate dahil mataas pa peso vs $. Pero ngayon sa 54:1 na. I see troubled times ahead kung di nag improve economy
9402 2018-10-17 10:20:34 The Russians are happy. Should the US “punish” Khadhoogi’s murderers, the price of oil is up, and Putin is back in business.
9403 2018-10-17 10:20:14 I burned my chest and stomach with oil trying to shallow fry Chiko rolls a few weeks ago (a crazy impulse buy). For my own safety, I won’t have a go with fish fingers, but I commend your effort!
9404 2018-10-17 10:20:10 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

9416 2018-10-17 10:18:52 Hard to put into words my feelings about the Kashoggi murder. Latest is that they began cutting him up while he was still alive. Saudi Arabia needs to be shunned by every nation on earth. At this point we can survive without their oil. Let them eat it.

9428 2018-10-17 10:17:12 For once I have to slightly disagree @BhadraPunchline; at least from the energy sector prism the relationship value with Saudi is at best, neutral if not unhelpful. The energy vector most important for India is gas, not oil anymore.
9429 2018-10-17 10:17:00 The #isleofman Government is hoping they’ll strike oil to pay for their unsustainable pensions #ClubTynwald
9430 2018-10-17 10:16:59 how much is cooking oil and how many bottles can one buy?

9432 2018-10-17 10:16:51 I think there are problems with whole 'data = oil' paradigm but I get what you mean. Very interesting discussion to be had on balance/intersection between the personal & the public good. What say will French citizens get in how these data - their personal information - are used?
9433 2018-10-17 10:16:49 I really don’t give a crap about the DNA. Warren is the only one fighting for the 90% against big banks, big oil, big pharma, cc companies, and for-profit colleges. She is VOCAL and she is RIGHT. And that is why trump and the @GOP go after her.

Stop this ridiculousness!
9434 2018-10-17 10:16:04 Why don’t these Prophets use their healing powers and prosperity what nots to Reboot the Zimbabwean Economy? Or at the very least get us some cooking oil!

9444 2018-10-17 10:14:59 Doubtful research. Very similar to 'coconut oil is poisonous'. Some calcium syrup company may have sponsored this and thus making it easier to market their product in the garb of this research 
9445 2018-10-17 10:14:36 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

9447 2018-10-17 10:14:33 No. We should not ignore it.
We have to be up against it, ideologically, politically and economically.

The rulers of KSA have done nothing but bank on their oil reserves to brandish their sword of medieval morality.

9457 2018-10-17 10:13:24 Jonathan had the biggest fortune; from 2010 to 2015, the average crude oil price per barrel was $91, representing 37% of the total average from 1999 to 2016.

9463 2018-10-17 10:12:25 For too long we have overlooked Saudia Arabia heinous behavior, because of oil. It"s time to call them out for the murders they are 9/11, Osama Bin Laden and now #JamalKhasoggi

9476 2018-10-17 10:10:32 Saudi Arabia has the west in an arm lock.  It needs their oil, and needs them to buy arms.  So, don't expect anything to harm that.  No censure from US, UK, France, Germany etc - just a sweeping under the carpet exercise...

9480 2018-10-17 10:09:45 How come we have to resort to the obvious truths? We are aware of the UN’s human rights committee, their participation in oil blackmail, their commitment to petroleum-wars for the past 18 years. The people and our future  need more than cliche appeasement. #endthefed
9481 2018-10-17 10:09:26 More accurate is shallow like an oil sheen...
9482 2018-10-17 10:09:08 Peak oil werd gepushed door linkse milleugekkies en toen bleek dat het onzin was zijn ze alles in gaan zetten op climate change. 
Beide hebben als doel en of als resultaat dat economische ontwikkeling beperkt wordt en een nieuw industrieel complex creeert.
9483 2018-10-17 10:08:56 What’s the oil tho? 
9484 2018-10-17 10:08:53 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
9485 2018-10-17 10:08:39 And we can't or won't, realistically, do anything about a regime like that because of oil and money!! Horrible

9490 2018-10-17 10:07:56 I think there is a fundamental difference between charlatanry, and technological/philosophical dychotomies. Dentacoin, Bitconnect and Onecoin are obvious snake oil, while Ether, Bcash and Zcash actually offer something to other highly skilled and technical groups of people.
9491 2018-10-17 10:07:13 When it comes to the house of saud, the US have looked the other way since the first barrel of oil.

Changing from coal, oil, natural gas heating to geothermal? To solar/wind, cutting out gasoline? 12 yrs? Denial, 1st step...
9498 2018-10-17 10:06:20 The present administration is justified in lamenting the $36.57 average crude oil price per barrel in 2016 but the public should not be misled on the incorrect $100 average oil prices per barrel from 1999 to 2015.

9504 2018-10-17 10:05:32 CBD/THC ratio is a must, thankfully you can supplement this with legal CBD oil but it is nice if you actually know the pot's THC%. Legalisation will allow edibles/drinkables and therefore introduce people to a far safer and superior way to enjoy the drug in my opinion.
9505 2018-10-17 10:05:32 Those of you who don’t oil your bodies, why?

9511 2018-10-17 10:04:52 Your statement could have been true if you were referring only to Goodluck Jonathan’s tenure when average crude oil price per barrel rose to $107 in 2011 and an all-time high of $109.45 in 2012 as well as $105.87 in 2013. It fell to $96.29 in 2014 and a very record low of $49.49

9516 2018-10-17 10:03:23 What happens to an economy without oil?
9517 2018-10-17 10:03:16 I would still rather burn wood fuel than oil (am currently on oil.. Working on how to get off it!) wood it least sucks in co2 in its tree life. Unlike oil. Need to think bigger and penalise us stove users!
9518 2018-10-17 10:03:11 Fossil fuels are those produced by the earth a million years ago, when pumped dry they are gone. There is immense poverty in Saudi Arabia and when that oil dwindles down, so to goes their Trillion dollar a year export business and much of the West's business with them.
9519 2018-10-17 10:03:04 I've even contacted Body Shop to see if they are ever going to bring out Dewbury Oil again. I could imagine they would do pretty well just selling to people between the ages of 45-55. Would be nice to reminisce the good old day

9521 2018-10-17 10:02:50 was something done? Does it take a century to fix Lagos-ibadan especially during oil boom?

9530 2018-10-17 10:01:26 By 2008, during Musa Yar’Adua’s tenure, a barrel of average crude oil was $94.45 and later fell to $77. 45 when he died in 2010

Then again an indy Scotland can define those NEW licences , as partner stakeholders.
9539 2018-10-17 10:00:58 In 1999 when the military handed over power to Olusegun Obasanjo, the average crude oil price was $16.56 per barrel. In 2003 when he was re-elected for a second term, average crude oil price rose to $28.05 per barrel and $69.08 per barrel in 2007.

9547 2018-10-17 09:59:47 Are you sure about your hierarchy model? Government is an entity which is executing its will through subordinated powers they created. Fiat money of C-banks is NOT one of them.
Car runs on oil. Oil can be used in 1000 different ways without car. Car without oil is just a trash

9561 2018-10-17 09:57:55 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
9562 2018-10-17 09:57:53 That's  a good idea if they can  let those with foreign currency to  by products from outside so that shops will  be full  may be the prices will  be deduced  as more products like cooking oil will be found  on shelves not at black market
9563 2018-10-17 09:57:50 So some shops are selling cooking oil with strings attached. They will sell it at the till and on condition that you buy at least $5 worth of their goods. What if I want nothing else but cooking fat? This is unfair @PicknPay #Zimbabwe and anybody else.
9564 2018-10-17 09:57:26 Until the USA can get off of dependency if foreign oil (US uses 17M/day and we are now producing over 10M/day), unfortunately, we still have to play nice with the Saudi Arabian family, IMO.

9568 2018-10-17 09:56:59 Wait oh! The same oil rigs .@PMBuhari and .@AsiwajuTinubu distributed to their families with impunity?
9569 2018-10-17 09:56:52 Not against naman the drivers since napipilitan lang din sila bec of the oil prices. I'm more angry and frustrated on the government thus the tweet haha
9570 2018-10-17 09:56:41 Turkey has no share in the resources... Turkish Cypriots yes not Turks... stop being jealous of Greece/Cyprus and their oil/gas deposits
9571 2018-10-17 09:56:29 Cucumber, green olives and tomato salad with some olive oil and sea salt is the key to my heart.
9572 2018-10-17 09:56:26 So @BetoORourke called @tedcruz “Lying Ted” after Ted claimed Beto supported an oil production tax, a claim that everyone with access to the internet knows is true? #dk #TexasDebate

9575 2018-10-17 09:56:19 Of course not its not about us consuming oil and Saudi's buying arms, its that the issue is much more complicated than the UK-Saudi trade relationship and that at an individual level we should all take responsibility for our current overreliance on petrochemicals
9576 2018-10-17 09:56:18 Hey how is OGI's oils looking?? Oh yea thats right ACB runs the oil market on the Ocs . Expecting better tweets from you Elvis. No one cares if your favorite colour is Edison blue.
9577 2018-10-17 09:56:14 Really read up on political classes, first then come back! You don’t have to be part of a government, But haven’t heard you say no oil for weapons to the Saudis whiles May’s husband profits, you hypocrite yes Blair and Cameron are to blame, but your silence is even worse,
9578 2018-10-17 09:56:01 Modern day snake oil. I despair.
9579 2018-10-17 09:55:39 No because nothings there. Unless you find oil.

9582 2018-10-17 09:55:02 which proves they do not give 1 fook about anything else but money.  If the saudi's said we are going to put a virus which will wipe out 25% of the population in Europe are we ok with that?  they would be like yeah sure give us the oil and money.. Parasites.
9583 2018-10-17 09:54:48 OIL does not equal a stupid Plant, crash the ass ot of the Canadian market!

9587 2018-10-17 09:54:21 It's the JIT EU supply chain that's most vulnerable. I'm stockpiling olive oil and getting ready to make my own pesto.
9588 2018-10-17 09:54:10 The Saudi's have competing factions just like US, though they do play a little rougher. I think this was a set up, Bin Salman has no reason to do something so stupid. I don't trust Erdogan and with Iranian oil sanctions about to kick in, the timing is very suspect.
9589 2018-10-17 09:54:09 There's a nice quirk of ours as well. We call it Petrol (short for Petroleum) which can just be a synonym for Crude Oil - but I think you can also use "Petroleum" for refined Crude Oil...and Gasoline and Diesel are both by products of refining petroleum...
9590 2018-10-17 09:53:59 or forcing the oil companies to take a smaller profit on refining and distribution (the profit margin is already fixed and tiny). 

Unfortunately "think" is not an activity that is done too often in parliament.

9592 2018-10-17 09:53:35 Because of Oil and Saudi being a strategic partner in the Gulf Trump doesn't want to go against the Kingdom's King and call the killing of Khashoodi as a human right infringement.
9593 2018-10-17 09:53:08 Sana oil!!!!
9594 2018-10-17 09:53:03 Well excuse us for asking the kingdom of oil fatboy.

9600 2018-10-17 09:52:10 5: Get another loamy soil and treat it by heating it up and leave to cool
6:  Put the treated soil back into the pen after fumigation
7:  get dark oil or engine oil and put it into the trench dug round the pen but make sure it's well monitored  and pen closed well.
9601 2018-10-17 09:52:09 Right. Because oil is not important any more.
9602 2018-10-17 09:51:50 While facts about poverty in Nigeria illustrate how the country makes most of its money from its oil sector, the nation has unfortunately become overly-dependent on this single industry.
9603 2018-10-17 09:51:37 Maybe he's right? Maybe academics have formed a global conspiracy and the only thing saving us from brainwashing and economic destruction is the oil industry?
9604 2018-10-17 09:51:29 I drived for about 25 km with a sign 'Fill the Oil', one of tge stupidest thing ive ever done. Got lost finding a gas station, luck to have one later! 
9605 2018-10-17 09:51:16 Do you have a better source for oil available?
9606 2018-10-17 09:51:11 Yep. Libya had the gold dinar, Iraq and Syria wanted to trade oil in the Euro. Now, what else do those countries have in common....?
9607 2018-10-17 09:51:01 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) plans to invest Rs 5,463 crore in setting up city #gas distribution network for retailing #CNG to automobiles and piped cooking #gas. #krsinfra
9608 2018-10-17 09:50:53 Have you calculated the socio-economic impact from Oil Rig Decommissioning in the Clyde? There has to be a better utilisation of @CrownEstateScot Hunterston Yard that actually supports the tourist industry than supporting Peelports revolving door industrial asset stripping?
9609 2018-10-17 09:50:40 Settling #oil bill in ₹ is an old, but sound idea. But there wouldn’t be many takers until Govt can ensure a strong & more importantly, stable currency. The obsession for a weak currency is hardly conducive to that idea.
9610 2018-10-17 09:50:37 And you let noddles talk you out of picking the Oil to win

9616 2018-10-17 09:49:46 so they got them to hedge , not allowing them to participate in oil upside
and then they still hit them with top rates.

9626 2018-10-17 09:48:40 2.Nigeria has a current Gross Domestic Product (GDP) worth of $405.10 billion, and represents more than half a percent of the world economy. Its main industry is oil, which contributes to poverty in Nigeria and ruins water sources due to constant oil spills.
9627 2018-10-17 09:48:31 Will this be as good as Venezula? Without the oil wealth of course.
9628 2018-10-17 09:48:19 Through oil boom and bust, recessions and great recessions the pro business state continues to be a magnet across the spectrum of business. The model is strong and needs to be kept out of the mitts of progressives. Say no to Rob from central casting.
9629 2018-10-17 09:48:08 Same argument applies in spades to natural resources such as oil & above all to the creative commons

9701 2018-10-17 09:36:13 We also need the economy to revolve around agriculture a little bit more, in few years time the demand for oil is going to drastically drop due to other less hazardous technologies e.g the bio fuel, the use of solar to power cars which is already happening in Brazil. #atiku4pres

9708 2018-10-17 09:34:55 Exactly- 1979-1984 contracts and promises rendered dust... you are not precise:- the finance industry - money lending on a titanic scale is the uks only industry - employs no one, holds us all hostage to bankers... built in Canary Wharf by Scottish oil
9709 2018-10-17 09:34:47 Oil cloth surely? 
9710 2018-10-17 09:34:41 In oil or stocks?
9711 2018-10-17 09:34:38 Another way to look at this is that Iran lost to Saudi Arabia in the war to control Gulf oil. Both draw oil from same reservoir in Persian / Arabian gulf and if Iran can not do it, then Saudi will get free hand. Iran is unwilling to please USA while Saudi have no issues with it.
9712 2018-10-17 09:34:29 Let's not be to hard on Saudi Arabia even though they murdered Khashoggi because it will cause them to in turn respond by raising oil prices and drastically cut production to the point that it will radically affect our Economy to the point that it stops growth. 

VOTE REPUBLICAN!
9713 2018-10-17 09:34:03 1. You can use ash and garlic extract. Soak crushed garlic in water overnight and spray the solution in the pen. You can also spray wood ash.

2. Dig a trench around the pen and fill it with water and discarded engine oil.

9717 2018-10-17 09:33:20 We can be nothing but a cursed generation when we celebrate Sugar and Cooking Oil iri overpriced after all Lord help Us
9718 2018-10-17 09:33:17 It's all a giant shitshow, agreed. I'll be happy if we can get off oil and gas, that'll allow us to finally take a stand on SA and Russia.
9719 2018-10-17 09:33:13 You are talking about Great Saudi Arabia just cutting oil production by 3 million barrels and increasing the price offset the cut
9720 2018-10-17 09:33:03 We believe that #Saudi leadership would be extremely reluctant to exercise the oil weapon option, as its reputation as the world’s stable, reliable oil central banker would be severely undercut

9723 2018-10-17 09:32:35 If you replace the word "data" with "oil" and "ai tools" with "oil wells" it doesn't seem outlandish. Surely the national choice is directly licensing data exploitation for money (? stifling innovation) or risk sharing by accepting value later in the form of tools.

If one takes the oil, makes it into single use plastic, collects the waste & then burns it, it does not get taxed but subsidised. Stop the perverse incentives! @EU_Commission

9847 2018-10-17 09:12:52 Yes I started taking oregano oil before I started antibiotics for Lyme. Oregano oil is antibiotic & strong. My sinuses felt like they were on fire & oregano oil helped reduce that. Lyme can be hell to live with. I’ve been on and off antibiotics since April 2015.
9848 2018-10-17 09:12:48 Excellent article. I actually thought this when the Tory government started squandering North Sea oil revenues in the 1980s and selling off all the Country's assets - at bargain basement prices!

9873 2018-10-17 09:07:38 You know - the reason I was told is the cooking temperature (in the larger Kadhais in which the Bhog / Halwa is made) and the amount of oil or ghee used (far more than at home or when prepared in smaller quantities). #ProTip

SpaceX kills rocket cost fraud. Tesla kills planned obsolescence in the car industry. And drastically reduces the need for big oil.

9972 2018-10-17 08:49:11 Historical records have people start using hot oil for both cooking and warfare at nearly the same time. Someone either burned themselves while cooking and said "You can do this to other people" or burned someone alive and said "Damn that smells good."
9973 2018-10-17 08:49:11 lol try over cook it ashele na Ku olive oil
9974 2018-10-17 08:49:05 KSA oil is down to less than 10-15% of what we use.

9979 2018-10-17 08:47:45 It's been a big job to score the record number of entries for the 2018 Brian Chambers award, so we're running a few days late. But the judges have been 'burning the weekend oil', and we have now let the ten finalists know who they are . We've seen some great research!
9980 2018-10-17 08:47:39 And I know that the different chemical compositions of different gasses, etc, is going to create different datasets - compartmentalise datasets. So if some data says 80% of sites have leaks of upto 10barrels 1ce per yr etc and then I read its from oil storage vessels >
9981 2018-10-17 08:46:26 Vanhu vatema havana chakanaka nezuro maichemera sugar ne cooking oil, yauya makutaura zvimwe.
9982 2018-10-17 08:46:22 Don't waste time with that No Brainer ...he wishes that he can mix water and oil and it's impossible
9983 2018-10-17 08:46:19 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
9984 2018-10-17 08:46:16 I warm some olive oil and put in ear then plug it up, keeping it warm helps ease pain
9985 2018-10-17 08:46:15 gusto ko siomai with maraming chili garlic oil

9988 2018-10-17 08:45:40 Ouzo is genuinely disgusting, would rather drink motor oil.
9989 2018-10-17 08:45:39 Popcorns are fried in the same pot, same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, Buh they do not pop at the same time. Ur time is not my time, buh we all go pop. Gbogbo wa pata lama gbera 
9990 2018-10-17 08:45:33 Coming up on @CNBCWEX at 5amET:

All things $NFLX with @Richard_Ampere, oil updates from                     @ea_amrita, and markets with Mark Avallone, @TimmerFidelity, and David Joy.

@TheDomino has all the news you need this busy Wednesday - you won't want to miss it!
9991 2018-10-17 08:45:32 So its handling procedures, equipment, as well as the geology is different. Yet people try and fool me with data from the US on shale OIL handling and air quality - even without thinking about UK regs compared to OK, PEN, Texas etc - I do know what a gas is not a liquid.
9992 2018-10-17 08:45:07 This. Every. Day.
I’ll be that guy in Waterworld living inside the oil tanker who, when the match is seen falling into the hole, quietly says, “Oh, Thank God.”
9993 2018-10-17 08:44:28 Financial Revolution  
   Paying Indian currency for oil import we go back to ancient Trade Practice ie  Barter Ex Change we have to export Wheat etc
Will result shortage of Wheat price of Wheat zoom  instead of hike in Oil Price  hike in Wheat one evil replace another wich beter
9994 2018-10-17 08:44:23 Now Playing Joshua Rogers - Pour Your Oil
9995 2018-10-17 08:44:14 You can only see as much as a man wants you to see bro.. 
Don't be quick to judge.. 
I'm not saying he's gonna loot anyway, but then one can never know..  
One thing I know is @atiku will get an oil well in his first year, but he'll work n manage better.. Man's got experience.
9996 2018-10-17 08:44:12 If in the UK the hydrocarbon ratio of the produced fluid is 'dry', i.e. very methane rich and very low in heavier hydrocarbons (i.e. not an oil, but a gas). Its called Shale GAS in the UK for a reason. Its not OIL.
9997 2018-10-17 08:44:07 This from the Guardian:
"Thatcher loosed finance from its shackles and used our North Sea oil money to pay for swingeing tax cuts. The result is an overfinancialised economy.."

"Our North Sea Oil Money" - there you have it, Scottish Oil belongs to England!

Do you think so?
9998 2018-10-17 08:43:54 Fun fact: gay sex in Ancient Greece used olive oil as lube
9999 2018-10-17 08:43:48 That's good news - if India gets waiver & is able to purchase oil from Iran in ₹. That'll be a Diwali bonanza. 
10000 2018-10-17 08:43:43 あーち！ちー！あーちー！
燃えてるんだろうか？
10001 2018-10-17 08:43:21 I used this growth oil and I no longer have baby hairs these motherfuckers are full grown . But it’s like damn wtf do I do now continue to try to swoop them or let them grow super long or cut them to where they use to be. I’m so lost 
10002 2018-10-17 08:43:20 What of the $125m you diverted from the Petroleum Trust Development Fund? Can you please, explain to Nigerians how you managed to command controlling shares in Bank PHB, controlling shares in Intel, and oil services companies operating in many African countries? #RedefineNigeria
10003 2018-10-17 08:43:10 There was considerably more analysis done on Scotland breaking away from the UK than UK from EU.

To suggest that another Indyref will reverse the previous conclusion is deluded.

If anything the economic advantage of being in UK has been highlighted by the recent oil crash.
10004 2018-10-17 08:43:07 @riskstaff got a contingency for if Hormuz is closed along with Russia's pending? Eritrea port... Could have massive affect on oil shipments?
10005 2018-10-17 08:42:49 Take for example a paper on air quality around shale oil production with continuous flaring, degassing from storage ponds, oil handling equipment leaks etc. Why point me at a paper saying trace amounts of benzene were detected in such a situation and then try and fool me?
10006 2018-10-17 08:42:31 Guna baby wipes yg fragrance free tp tak bersih mana la still kena guna cleansing oil/micellar water
