1 2018-02-22 23:59:45 Not all guns. Just assault rifles. You don't need an assault rifle. You don't need bump stocks. Keep your hand guns, shot guns, and hunting rifles. But no civilian needs an assault rifle
2 2018-02-22 23:59:40 Looks, IDGAF about collapsible stocks and tangential semantics, ok? Save that. 
You have several good ideas here, but it needs to go further than that. Again I ask you, have you ever had someone start firing either of those off around you unexpectedly?
3 2018-02-22 23:59:36 So let’s arm teachers and also at the same time allow people that have mental problems to still get guns. Last time I heard bump stocks don’t stop crazy people from getting guns. By arming teachers you also create a problem of making sure they are mentally stable to have guns.
4 2018-02-22 23:59:03 Bump stocks should never have been legal at all
5 2018-02-22 23:58:16 He wants to arm 20% of teachers to combat active shooters? How’s the reaction been to that? Why weren’t bump-stocks outlawed after the Las Vegas massacre? Why didn’t Congress renew the assault weapons ban? 

Just wear your NRA ball caps, jackets, wrist bands and tattoos.
6 2018-02-22 23:58:14 You obviously have no clue about this issue. Bump stocks are a gimmick. You can get the same effect with a rubber band. This is the type of thing the Democrats do. You just screwed yourself out of a second term.
7 2018-02-22 23:58:02 Because of wildfires I guess. 

Anyways,  seems like you're getting your wish.  Trump is attacking the issue from different angles, sales age and control, background check,  bump stocks, armed teachers. I'd like to see all of them but even half isn't a bad start.
8 2018-02-22 23:57:42 Bump stocks are your right?  It's your right to bear arms to protect your family and property...the Constitution was written when single-shot muskets were in use...bump stocks r not you're right.  And no one wants to ban guns, just anything that is a weapon of mass destruction.
9 2018-02-22 23:57:36 How about banning AR-15 sales, large magazine sells and bump stocks and raising the age to buy a firearm to 21? NRA won't like it, but kids and older citizens will be safer.
10 2018-02-22 23:57:07 According to NRA LaPierre, as the father of an 8 year old school child, wanting to put restrictions on bump stocks & assault style guns means I’m not interested in protecting children, I only want to make YOU less free. Same tired argument. Anything new to say LaPierre?
11 2018-02-22 23:56:43 Where in the 1st amendment does it mention Twitter?  I agree that bumb stocks should be banned, but please consider a better argument.  Look at what the constitution DOES say, not what it doesn’t.

13 2018-02-22 23:56:16 That’s BS. I support individual freedom and the right to bear arms. BUT there is no reason for a civilian to have an AR-15, AK’s of any kind or bump stocks. These are military weapons for combat. Not for individuals.
14 2018-02-22 23:56:09 I don’t really care about stocks and stuff like that, I just want to have kids be safe. When I was in school from the 70’s to the 80’s
15 2018-02-22 23:56:06 Effective Gun Control would regulate objective factors such as:
1) Rate of fire

Lists of specific weapons, as in previous laws, are of minimal utility. Use of plastic in stocks is irrelevant.

17 2018-02-22 23:55:16 Im conflicted because I’m happy that Trump is pushing a ban on bump stocks and for a raise in buying age for firearms and him expecting the NRA to “do the right thing” but then he goes and looks to arm teachers and AGH so close

19 2018-02-22 23:54:31 I hate guns. I wish they would all just go away but I am willing to meet half way and remove assault rifles, bump stocks and large magazines. Move to more extensive background checks and more help for mentally troubled individuals. Why won't they compromise for our kids?

41 2018-02-22 23:54:11 Strange, tough time in the markets back then though.  My memory was most people were 100% stocks.
42 2018-02-22 23:54:09 Congressional GOP have been working on a bill to close the NICS loophole that allowed the Texas church shooter to get a gun. Trump is also working with sessions to ban bump stocks.

44 2018-02-22 23:53:52 @WhiteHouse I applaud the steps Mr Trump proposes: min. 21 years old, better checks, bump stocks illegal, more help for mental illness. However, arming teachers: bad idea, listen to the cops on that one.
45 2018-02-22 23:52:13 When it comes to stocks, I always buy when it’s going down. You get more for your money.
46 2018-02-22 23:52:04 how do we hold Parent(s) accountable for the actions of their creation? Let’s enforce laws with real pinishment before screwing with the Constitution. Bump stocks can be 3D printed in 5 minutes. Get Real or get lost
47 2018-02-22 23:51:49 I repeat: We're not arming teachers. We can barely pay them. 
We're banning assault weapons & bump stocks; doing universal bg checks; closing the boyfriend & gun show loopholes; and studying gun violence. End of story.

     #PresidentTrump Orders Regulations To BAN #Gun Devices Luke Bump Stocks!
     What if we ban the part of the gun that shoots the bullets?
     “What good would THAT do?”
51 2018-02-22 23:51:39 Yeah, prohibit bump stocks on the rifles, but guess what? Even without the bump stock that rifle is still shooting a lot of bullets in a short amount of time. No logic whatsoever!
52 2018-02-22 23:51:38 We need to see the NRA digging its heels in on Trump talking about executive orders on buying age and bump stocks. Still have yet to see any push back on that.
53 2018-02-22 23:51:37 not sure cause last day na baka clearing stocks na lang. ill take a pic later when i get home got 4 books din
54 2018-02-22 23:51:03 @realDonaldTrump I got more money in my paycheck! This mean 960 a year more! Just in tax saving! @POTUS THANK YOU!! That’s my President!
55 2018-02-22 23:50:35 It’s getting to the point that it’s not worth commenting on here. But here goes: the guns are already out there. That said, raise the purchase age to 21. Mental evaluation. 10 day wait period. Ban bump stocks. Limit mags to 6 rounds. Pass class for all purchases.
56 2018-02-22 23:49:54 Bump stocks actually were created for the handicap but has been exploited

58 2018-02-22 23:49:27 Stand up for gun controls! Stand up for taking military grade weapons off the street! Police cannot defend themselves let alone our kids against armor piercing bullets, bump stocks, AR/AK MILITARY grade weapons! These ARE NOT constitutionally protected! You have a job! Do it!
59 2018-02-22 23:49:25 I agree. The plan to arm teachers only makes (a tiny bit of) sense if the teachers are given AR-15s with bump stocks, since that's likely what they'll be facing.  Sound good?
60 2018-02-22 23:49:13 NO!! Don't cave in!!  RT @realDonaldTrump: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
61 2018-02-22 23:48:57 There are things we can do to reduce the deadliness of shootsings (no AR-15s or bump stocks) and there are things we can do to reduce the amount of shootings.
62 2018-02-22 23:48:51 Holy shit.. Kylie jenner stating that she doesn’t use Snapchat anymore made Wall Street freak out and snapchats stocks went down like DRASTICALLY.. That is fatal, we already know all the VPs are scrambling at the HQ.. LMAO
63 2018-02-22 23:48:49 Yes, people kill people. However, people with semi-automatic guns and guns with bump stocks are ankle to kill more people faster than someone with a gun that is manually advanced or with any other weapon. Don't mention bombs, the kid couldn't even drive a car.
64 2018-02-22 23:48:37 Well, no. They're much faster than most hunting rifles. And they're a lot faster with a bump stock. Are you going to support banning bump stocks?
65 2018-02-22 23:48:30 We can ban bump stocks if we unban the reason they exist... none of these school shootings happened when Americans could own fully automatic weapons.  Look it up
66 2018-02-22 23:48:22 Hate to get nit picky but she have had a point about her Trump reservations since he is currently caving like an earthquake rattles building on gun control laws. Bump stocks banned? More background checks? Increasing the age to buy a gun? Seems she was correct to mistrust him.
67 2018-02-22 23:48:21 If anything has to be done with bump stocks, they need to be grandfathered in!!! Owning one makes a person a felon over night by a stoke of a pen if not GRANDFATHERED IN!!! I DONT WANT TO HEAR ANY TYPE OF TURN IN PERIOD! IT DOESNT CONVERT A RIFLE INTO A MACHINE GUN!!!
68 2018-02-22 23:48:08 Great, but haven't assault weapons killed more people than bump stocks?
69 2018-02-22 23:48:07 You are right. The war on drugs is a bad model.  Start with repealing the Dickey amendment. Outlaw bump stocks.  Outlaw gun modifications. Enforce tracking of private sales like cars.
70 2018-02-22 23:47:57 @GreaterAngliaPR @greateranglia Can’t wait to see the new Class 720’s, Class 745’s and Class 755’s to enter service from 2019-onwards. Already getting excited about the new trains coming in few years. To replace the older rolling stocks.
71 2018-02-22 23:47:53 Then you know idiots. Bump stocks are a joke... They fail after a few rounds. Take them. Shows your people are as uneducated about guns as they are.
72 2018-02-22 23:47:39 Why stocks are not delivered in Bihar . Common
73 2018-02-22 23:47:28 The Syria Strike was the first straw in losing your base but I guess the next straw in banning bump stocks
74 2018-02-22 23:47:20 I love stocks where upside case is +47% and downside case is +1%
75 2018-02-22 23:47:09 I’m blocked too, for no literally no reason, I’ve never tweeted at him. I guess bc I’m long some stocks I’m a pumper or something. 
76 2018-02-22 23:47:05 No lie I wish I had some extra cheese because snapchats stocks will fall in these next couple of months but I guarantee they will switch to the old design and stocks will shoot back up.
77 2018-02-22 23:46:45 Thanks for the honest reply. I'm thinking pot stocks will only move up on news over the next while, but I'm hopeful for CANN news soon. I wouldn't keep it if I didn't think a catalyst was near. Still holding for now. Bought more today, in fact.
78 2018-02-22 23:46:02 Trump is getting a right do'ing from his base over his 3 gun control proposals! Blimey, they are furious at him for his 'lefty', 'liberal' ways. 

Will be interesting to see if he ploughs ahead with raising it to 21 and banning bump stocks
79 2018-02-22 23:45:59 Understood, thank you Sir!
80 2018-02-22 23:45:43 @POTUS putting guns into school is absolutely the wrong idea.  In no situation does more available guns make students safer.  Work on banning assault rifles and bump stocks and increasing mental health services instead.  Be smart.
81 2018-02-22 23:45:35 I have no issue with changing age except as mentiined b4 at 18 we give them m16 and say go defend us.  Bump stocks should be illegal but u can go on u-tube n see how to easily make ur own.  Neither idea will actually make a difference.  Harden the schools!
82 2018-02-22 23:45:17 Did anyone else notice that the use of bump stocks effectively kills the “bans don’t work” narrative?
83 2018-02-22 23:45:16 trump is trying to con people into thinking he really cares and backing worthwhile changes . Raising age limit and banning bump stocks won't get rid of assault rifles or address the mass murder problem. FAKE gesture .
84 2018-02-22 23:44:55 Stocks up Twitter stock down. Wonder why?

87 2018-02-22 23:44:08 I agree, re stocks in council libraries. This particular "library" is a volunteer one now ofc, and not part of the council's provision, so the act doesn't apply to them and they can be as inaccessible as they like :(
88 2018-02-22 23:43:59 Bump stocks is lip service, we just need some common sense legislation, like a simple federal tracking database and private seller registration requirements. Easy shit
89 2018-02-22 23:43:48 Trade Trigger isn’t going to make up false text, he had shares of $bvtk and got mad at me for saying the CEO was a scammer. Tom is the biggest lying CEO in penny stocks though.
90 2018-02-22 23:43:45 I don’t understand why the need for Bump Stocks?
91 2018-02-22 23:43:39 I hope the proposal doesn’t involve arming teachers, who are already over-burdened & under-paid. We are a family of gun-owning farmers and hunters, and we believe it’s time to end the manufacture & sale of semiautomatic weapons & bump stocks. Period.
92 2018-02-22 23:43:38 Hello, Kylie? This is your financial adviser calling. Let's talk about social media stocks.
93 2018-02-22 23:43:28 Bump stocks?? That’s @realDonaldTrump being a politician there- giving the bleeding Libs one of their pet issues.  Completely meaningless in reality. Bump stocks are literally harmless.
But they look cool. Focus on the shooter- not the gun! #NRA #2ndAmendment
94 2018-02-22 23:42:58 Thanks Governor Brown, let’s not wait for Congress if there is more sensible gun reform that we can do as Oregonian’s.

We have been waiting 4+ months for no bump stocks which should have been a “no brainer”
95 2018-02-22 23:42:20 Agree with you. The things he is talking about is common sense. Bump stocks? No civilian should ever need one. And clearly we do need to do a better job with background checks
96 2018-02-22 23:42:06 Ur never forget hashtags r killing me bc in a week DACA stocks me too times up & kneeling for an anthem r already forgotten
97 2018-02-22 23:41:56 4 months later after 58 people died at a fucking concert and bump stocks are completely legal still. That's beyond unbelievable
98 2018-02-22 23:41:52 Just a question, not saying yay or nay on any proposed bump stock ban, but just a question: If bump stocks get banned, what will you do?  How will you react? The right is to bear arms. An AR-15 will still fire without a bump stock. What happens if they’re banned?
99 2018-02-22 23:41:37 You DTOLE MY MONEY WHETHER IT WAS YOUR FDA SECRETSRY OF DEFENSE SECRETSRY OF INTERIOR YOUR FAMILY S WERE GETTING STOCKS IM SURE OF THAT
100 2018-02-22 23:41:32 If I were POTUS: I would have already set up a TASK FORCE of SOCIAL SCIENTISTS to look at how other countries have SOLVED THIS PROBLEM.  As well as issued EOs for every single thing I could - -bump stocks, ARs, background checks.  FOR A START. #NeverAgain

102 2018-02-22 23:40:55 So everything that happened in the Las Vegas shooting, except bump stocks) is no longer on the table from Trump, NRA or GOP.   No AR15 ban. No age bump.  They don’t care about those people.  Barely care about kids (but really but them at more risk with guns IN the classroom)

105 2018-02-22 23:40:05 If Trump interferes with comments opposing regulation of bump stocks.
106 2018-02-22 23:39:56 I'm for eliminating bump stocks BEFORE they become prevalent like high capacity semiautomatic rifles have. There's 300 mil ARs out there now & many times that in high capacity magazines. Eliminate those now & you give citizens the disadvantage in an attack by a criminal. Think!

108 2018-02-22 23:38:37 Didn't the NRA come out in favor of banning bump stocks?
109 2018-02-22 23:38:18 Why do we as citizens need bump stocks?  Just need understanding
110 2018-02-22 23:38:09 Bump stocks are what that guy used in Vegas. It turns a semi auto into some what of an auto weapon instead of squeezing the trigger, you rest your finger on trigger, and the shoulder pressure does rest on stock. Smh. Face Palm. Geez....
111 2018-02-22 23:37:58 Because they over-fished and depleted fish stocks, making a quick Buck. UKIP's Thames Armada were prosecuted for it.
112 2018-02-22 23:37:44 You mean on the downfall now that the rich have bought back all there stocks skiped out on the taxes & now pulling there money back out of the economy. While over the next few years you raise taxes on middle class, gas, cut SS, and medical while slowly killing all social programs
113 2018-02-22 23:37:27 Is that “Like” a yes or no... LOL just your opinion..
114 2018-02-22 23:36:56 My opinion:
Bump stocks- should be illegal
Semi-automatic speeds should not have a limit as long as there aren't modifications.
115 2018-02-22 23:36:51 Please look at the complete history of gun sales and gun stocks after mass shootings. If a classroom of dead first graders didn't move the @NRA towards a change in policies, then they have to be hit where they will feel the most pain- in the wallet.
116 2018-02-22 23:36:31 Please push the legislation on background checks and mental health. Make it “extreme vetting.” Help US citizens get help they need for mental health. Please push the legislation to stop bump stocks and raise the purchasing age to 21. Please consider more changes too. Thank you
117 2018-02-22 23:35:50 It’s crazy that he says he wants to ban bump stocks and the NRA said they want to ban them. Why aren’t they banned already? Someone more powerful want them to stay legal?
118 2018-02-22 23:34:56 The manufacturer of bump stocks had a Presidents’ Day sale...10% off bump stocks with discount code MAGA.

I wish I was kidding...but it’s true.
119 2018-02-22 23:34:46 If existing assault weapons and bump stocks bans, are any example, the enforcement regime won’t be proactive and will require cooperation to be maximally effective. Not sure if there’s much reason to believe people will cooperate, but it will at least limit future sales.
120 2018-02-22 23:34:33 Changing the age to purchase a weapon and banning bump stocks is ridiculous and just squeezing one end of the balloon causing the air to move to another end.  Don't forget (because we haven't) that you ELIMINATED background checks for people who are mentally challenged.
121 2018-02-22 23:34:24 @realDonaldTrump Why is it that you won't hesitate to create and sign an EXECUTIVE ORDER to get what you want, but you only want to "START" working on making our schools &citizens safe from military weaponry? Where is the EA banning bump stocks? Raising the age limit? #NeverAgain
122 2018-02-22 23:34:05 FL Legislature. so dumb. so pointless. No, don’t focus on issues that could really use their support (i.e., banning automatic weapons & bump stocks). So, yes, let’s trust in God, but God doesn’t need our support. That is what the FL Legislature is making us Floridians out to be.
123 2018-02-22 23:33:58 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
124 2018-02-22 23:33:14 NRA backed ban on bump stocks after Nevada. Why was noyhing done.
125 2018-02-22 23:32:41 You may not know the AR platform is very popular. Its versatility translates into profits through accessories driving an industry, scopes, hand guards, upper/ lower, hand grips, stocks, sights, range of calibers. Make concessions now before it is gone.

127 2018-02-22 23:32:13 I'm not familiar with current gun laws.  However, things do seem like they are going to change fairly soon in response to the shooting.  Trump already spoke out about pushing some legislation like banning bump stocks,  raising the minimum age to buy a semiautomatic weapon to 21,
128 2018-02-22 23:31:45 Politicians are cluing in to the strength of the #StudentResistance. One after another, they weakening past rock-hard stances, saying, "We'd be willing to raise age limits, tighten background checks, & maybe outlaw bump stocks." I say that's not good enough. #BanAssaultWeapons
129 2018-02-22 23:31:27 He has weakened background checks - allowing more guns into the hands of the mentally unstable and fugitives. He has yet to ask Congress to work on a bill to ban bump stocks. He has talked gibberish about MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS!!!! #FAIL #NoMoreGuns #NoMoreBS #NeverAgain
130 2018-02-22 23:31:04 #BBCQT no one mentions our fishing industry destroyed by EU restrictions throwing tons of dead fish back in the sea every day , destroying our fish stocks
131 2018-02-22 23:30:38 Unless we’re legalizing armed drones, weaponized robotics, etc, it comes down to civilian safety. If bump stocks and assault style weapons are most destructive to civilian safety, that’s what must be addressed. Be realistic when you take a 2nd Ammendment argument
132 2018-02-22 23:30:35 Bump stocks are gun accessories. Gun Accessories are not a Right. Right to LIFE, Right to LIBERTY, Right to PERSUE HAPPINESS. These are my Rights. What Standing Militia do you belong to anyway? There is more to 2nd Amendment than the Right to own and bare arms.
133 2018-02-22 23:30:27 I would say mandatory background checks, banning the sale of firearms to people under 21, more research into technology that would make guns safer, taking semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks out of the hands of civilians, and again, more focus on mental health care.
134 2018-02-22 23:30:15 They don't make money off of bump stocks. That is why the are willing to have legislation in play against them.
135 2018-02-22 23:30:00 I agree that bump stocks are necessary. But just because killing another person won’t put you in jail, doesn’t mean it isn’t murder
136 2018-02-22 23:29:57 Whoa, show me in 2A where bump stocks are "your right".....holy gawd you people are delusional
137 2018-02-22 23:29:50 Hell yah now we're rolling. First attachment bump stocks! Bumpin' Bass!
138 2018-02-22 23:29:40 Tougher laws okay. Background Checks okay. Bump stocks get rid of ok .This shooter was already illegal. He was on a school campus with a firearm. If the shooter was unable to get an ar15 what would he have done.  Really give this some thought.  We have to secure our schools.
139 2018-02-22 23:29:38 ah yes. everyone always forgets that the second amendment states the right to bear arms, and any cool accessories to arms like bump stocks and dope high capacity magazines. #schoolshootershaverightstoo

141 2018-02-22 23:29:23 Using bump stocks is illegal?
142 2018-02-22 23:29:22 Armed teachers are even guards make more sense. Only gun free zones are targeted. Ban gun free zones and leave bump stocks and guns alone. Infringing on the gun rights of law abiding citizens makes no sense. You never hear of a mass shooting at a shooting range or gun shows.
143 2018-02-22 23:29:02 I assume you’re referencing the need for standing militia of armed citizens to stand up to a corrupt govt if necessary? If so, civilian militias are still grossly outgunned. Look at the weapons developed under DARPA - regular citizens stand no chance even with bump stocks
144 2018-02-22 23:28:58 I agree with a lot of the people.  I don't think it violates the 2A but if they take Bump Stocks than what's to say they don't come after other accessories.
145 2018-02-22 23:28:44 You ever balled so hard you tore your ACL like Derrick Rose? Like one minute you’re watchin your stocks rise and the next your callin an ambulance ‘cause your knee hurts. #goals #AmericanDream
146 2018-02-22 23:28:27 The only thing this legislation against bump stocks will do is empower the criminals who will use them regardless of laws.  Nobody heard of bumpstocks until Vegas which is still a shady case.
147 2018-02-22 23:27:52 What Wayne, worried you and others making close to $1million yearly running NRA might lose your bonus. There is no justification for assault weapons to be sold to anyone but military LEO. 2nd amendment has nothing to do with AR's or bump stocks, it's not the 1700's u r a joke.
148 2018-02-22 23:27:19 "Reinvested" into buying stocks from another shareholder, who will use the money to buy other stocks from yet another shareholder, who will use the money to buy other stocks... Buying stocks that have been issued 20 years ago is not investment, that's just redistributing the loot
149 2018-02-22 23:27:02 sweet baby Jesus.... where in the original constitution does it say it's cool to have bump stocks
150 2018-02-22 23:26:59 Will trading on @RobinhoodApp have same hours as stocks? 9:30am-4pm 

If so, I would be afraid to use considering the #cryptocurrency market doesn’t sleep and is extremely volatile.
151 2018-02-22 23:26:58 And the problem with that would be what? You get huge props for attending and standing up to what you knew would be a tough night. Ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles NO ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IS COMING, then work on mental health, waiting periods, and gun show sales/trades.

153 2018-02-22 23:26:22 You want to help? Email your local congressman and demand that they stop stalling the fix NICS act. It's stalled there, probably for political reasons. Trump also wants to ban bump stocks and raise the age of purchase from 18-21. Get on them!
154 2018-02-22 23:26:11 STOP! FOCUS on easy! NO bump stocks, NO sales to minors, NO MORE sales of auto and semi auto weapons. NO ONE gets a gun without a background check. DO NOT debate the "should teachers be armed". FOCUS on easy!

164 2018-02-22 23:23:41 Is it just me that thinks DJTs idea of arming teachers is just him supporting NRA even more by promoting even more guns? & no, I don’t believe his words to stop guns/bump stocks, just cheap sound bites to temporarily appease folks.
165 2018-02-22 23:23:23 What else should we do then. Stopping the sale of bump stocks is a great start!!
166 2018-02-22 23:22:58 The same banks that hold the gun companies money, stocks and shares etc?
167 2018-02-22 23:22:50 I read the constitution. There is no mention of bump stocks.
168 2018-02-22 23:22:46 High-capacity mags and bump stocks                                                         Sincerely,                                               A Liberal
169 2018-02-22 23:22:35 Bump stocks should have been banned after the Las Vegas massacre! They are not in the 2nd Amendment as a “right” to have.
170 2018-02-22 23:22:20 Didn't the NRA say they would not oppose the banning of bump stocks though?
171 2018-02-22 23:22:17 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP We don't want teachers armed, we want a ban on Military style assault weapons,  bump stocks,  high capacity magazines,  background checks for all purchasing guns.
172 2018-02-22 23:21:57 Bump stocks are not your right. You're not trained. You need to learn to drive before you drive a car and get a license. And that is still a privilege. You need military training to properly use this ASSAULT rifle for assaulting. They're not for hunting, unless you hunt humans.
173 2018-02-22 23:21:20 Not extreme by any stretch. No gun purchase if these criteria exist
1)Anyone convicted of any violent crime in past 10 years
2) Anyone not meeting the minimum age requirement
3) Anyone without a 3 day waiting period

No assault weapons, bump stocks or large
magazines.
174 2018-02-22 23:21:08 @POTUS Banning the bump stocks wont help, they should have always been put in the category of full auto with a special license requirement from the ATF. Banning them will only hurt your supporters. Now on to the age limit of 21.
175 2018-02-22 23:21:00 Yup, I ordered another ar and re-upped my membership yesterday. I bet those bump stocks will be worth a small fortune in 10 years if outlawed.
176 2018-02-22 23:20:46 What is your reason for wanting bump stocks?
177 2018-02-22 23:20:39 Also with the bump stocks I’d like to get one myself before they are banned. I get to keep my nice things
178 2018-02-22 23:20:38 But you cannot even articulate what an AR is! Where’s the line on what makes a magazine high capacity? Bump stocks? You can have them, I was never a fan lol.
179 2018-02-22 23:20:37 Deliver by banning AR-15s. Yes to more thorough background checks and banning bump stocks...but we need more!!!!  No to arming teachers! No teachers should be armed. What the hell are you thinking?  That is the most ridiculous solution. Wtf!!!
180 2018-02-22 23:20:36 I do not want to have teachers carrying guns. This is unacceptable. If swat team comes in and sees a gun they will shoot this person. We need to just ban AR and bump stocks. There is no need for them outside of the military. And increase age to 21
181 2018-02-22 23:20:27 I should've invested in stocks years ago

185 2018-02-22 23:19:41 Yeah....Gordon Brown was ace with our money....taxing pension schemes and selling half our gold stocks was a superb move
186 2018-02-22 23:19:17 Agreed, but I struggle to see how a library service can be for all users if (eg) they can't use it when it's open. And many library stocks are now insufficient to meet the requirements of the Act.
187 2018-02-22 23:19:08 As at when I checked no life lost. But the shops damn those shops had full stocks especially the provision store
188 2018-02-22 23:17:48 Serious question. If you want to end sales of bump stocks into semi-automatic weapons, what is the problem with banning semi-automatic weapons themselves?
189 2018-02-22 23:17:42 Conservatives: TRUMP WILL NEVER BE IMPEACHED HE IS THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER!!

Trump: I’m gonna make it so you have to go through extensive background checks, be 21, to buy a gun, oh and no bump stocks.

Also Conservatives: AHWHATTHEFOOKINGFUCK how could you do this!! Impeach him!
190 2018-02-22 23:17:21 AR-15s, for one. Assault style weapons. High capacity magazines. Bump stocks. Etc.
191 2018-02-22 23:16:56 Bump stocks are legal therefore are not murderers. Horrible logic. Abortion is illegal after certain stages which vary by state.
192 2018-02-22 23:16:47 Age limit- match shotgun and handgun laws. Kids, especially in high school, aren’t mature enough to own one themselves. Bump stocks- haven’t really heard a good argument as to why someone would even NEED those.
193 2018-02-22 23:16:40 @realDonaldTrump @waynelapierrejr It’s not time to harden schools-Wrong focus. It is time to harden background checks, ERPOs, harden access to military assault weapons and harden access to bump stocks. Keep A2 and Americans safe
194 2018-02-22 23:16:23 Bump stocks, guns, age, nor is the mental health excuse the problem! If a person wants to kill they will find a way to do it unless they r stopped before hand which the FBI had the chance in doing so but didnt!! Why aren't they being questioned about this
195 2018-02-22 23:16:21 Left defending law enforcement, DOJ, FBI & gov’t surveillance; 
Right talking about ramping up background checks & banning bump stocks;
McCain aide takes the 5th about Russian dossier; 
Dems want higher age limits for somethings & lower for others. 
The Upside Down
196 2018-02-22 23:16:16 We're going to do strong background checks, on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18, getting rid of the bump stocks, and focusing very strongly on mental health.  Trump sets out to deceive people. As he has puts it, “I play to people’s fantasies.” He's a liar & con-artist.
197 2018-02-22 23:16:15 The previous presidents policies have an effect stocks and economy for about 9 months after he leaves office. Everything that is happening right now is 100% Trump. Try to deny all you want. Trump is doing a lot of good.
198 2018-02-22 23:16:05 Are you put up by the NRA who's paying you who cares about bump stocks you must be related to the Las Vegas shooter
199 2018-02-22 23:16:01 "I have stocks in many things that have a sin tax. The laws are adjusted accordingly so I can benefit through death and murder. I will always win. You will always lose, believe me. Money is the only true God."
200 2018-02-22 23:15:35 Well she is certainly smarter than you Tilly. The left is salivating and praising Satan for these tragedies to further their agenda. It is a slippery slope. Eliminating bump stocks will do nothing to curb these types of tragedies it is a slippery slope!
201 2018-02-22 23:15:25 They would probably do what Massachusetts did with bump stocks and declare them contraband. Hand it over or get arrested
202 2018-02-22 23:15:00 The fix is sitting there Congress just won't approve it. He's also in favor of raising the age to purchase one of these rifles from 18-21 and ban bump stocks. They're stalling it, probably for political reasons.
203 2018-02-22 23:14:54 Aren't bump stocks pretty simple to diy? What do we think the effectiveness to mitigating mass shootings will be?
204 2018-02-22 23:14:40 Libs are winning the argument?  The fuck they are......you think there's going to be a gun ban?!  LOL!!  Adorable how naive you are.  Movement?  Sure.  Ban bump stocks? Increase purchase age? Comprehensive background checks? Mental health bans? All good ideas. Those aren't bans.
205 2018-02-22 23:14:36 Its just "i took more stocks than izaw against madiceking so im a better link than him and therefor a top player"

The izaw meme is so good, the joke he made was perfect
206 2018-02-22 23:14:30 @Samsung apparently is not learning from the @Apple mistake of putting phones out at $1000. Your stocks will drop. Your sales will not happen. These phone manufactures are getting arrogant as hell.
207 2018-02-22 23:13:49 I just had a good conversation w/ people on Facebook. I was told that AR-15s are very popular in hunting wild pigs or in rural areas rabid wildlife. So I'm not sold on banning AR-15s. But banning bump stocks & extended mags. I fully support
208 2018-02-22 23:13:42 I just listened to Wayne LaPierre’s NRA speech at CPAC. The NRA is a satanic organization, there’s not much else to it. Why not ban weapon sales for <21? Why not ban bump stocks? Money. Man cannot serve both god and money.
209 2018-02-22 23:13:31 Translation: If stocks fall, we will ditch formal Fed model and just sell free Fed puts
210 2018-02-22 23:13:14 I think all teachers should have assault rifles. Everyone should have assault rifles! Just sign right here and no more guns will kill good people. Forget bump stocks, obviously irrelevant. Or... maybe let’s just give everyone an assault rifle at 21. Safer America. @NRA
211 2018-02-22 23:13:10 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your EDS
212 2018-02-22 23:12:45 I disagree. The GOA's primary concern seems to be that the ban will be so poorly crafted that it will encompass far more than bump stocks. Although that's a reasonable concern I think the solution is to insist on good legislation rather than say "no legislation."
213 2018-02-22 23:12:40 Oh just remembered---another time a short tried to convince me that every Mafia family was involved in stocks except Family X---the one that he happened to be aligned with. Another liar.
214 2018-02-22 23:12:22 WHite gold ... more like white stuff up the nose what could possibly go wrong with relying on selling via  3 parties in china ... another bullshit stock how bellamys  still exists is beyond me ... every time a problem with these stocks roll out the two child story to pump
215 2018-02-22 23:12:17 What does it take for the ATF to ban bump-stocks?  More kids and adults killed like in Las Vegas.
216 2018-02-22 23:12:16 Ouais je vois a même pas deux métros j'ai des magasins qui ont des stocks 
Je vois les gens de la Creuse Lyon et tt les pauvres de ouf grosse force à eux
217 2018-02-22 23:12:09 Definitely a good start.  Tbh, the bump stocks isn't a big deal to me. I read an article about the ammo being used in these shootings, the surgeons say these kids don't stand a chance being surviving vs handgun wounds. I'm not sure how that could be addressed, just curious.
218 2018-02-22 23:12:03 That tweet you quoted, nor any on his time line say anything about a gun ban. I’m not sure exactly what your talking about. Strengthening background checks needs to be done, bum stocks are NRA legislation the age limit will not go anywhere once debated.
219 2018-02-22 23:11:50 If this were a bet, I'd say the market is waiting for China to finish their holidays so they can get back into crypto trading. The new government there is gonna make an announcement about it at some point, bitcoin/cryptos can't be ignored there for too much longer.
220 2018-02-22 23:11:18 This ban on bump stocks is so broad that it will also cover standard capacity magazines and semi-automatics with pistol grips.
221 2018-02-22 23:10:12 During periods of "fear" companies with actual free cash flow become more attractive vs cash poor story rich stocks..my 2 cents.
222 2018-02-22 23:10:09 Another mass-shooting psyop, another night where I get black-out drunk and order 700 "I hate the AR-15" stickers to NRA headquarters when those cocksuckers start talking about "making concessions" on bump stocks
223 2018-02-22 23:10:07 No need to get rid of the bump stocks if the high capacity clips are not available...
224 2018-02-22 23:10:00 I've always thought that putting them in stocks on the Mall in DC for 2 weeks and letting ppl express their... feelings, if you will.

Dog poo, rotten fruit, bad eggs, whatever they want to throw is good with me.

Then firing squad.... No Blindfolds, No Last Requests.
225 2018-02-22 23:09:58 It’s a step by step process. Could you garauntee if Dems got what they wanted, they wouldn’t then push for more? 
AR15, is not an assault rifle. If you’ve ever shot one, especially with a bump stock, you would love it! Bump stocks are tricky to use and takes practice.
226 2018-02-22 23:09:55 Leadership in stocks is shifting to inflationary issues such as materials and energy, while the financials don’t seem to perform well. This is typical of late stage bull markets, but still potential new highs. 
$SPX $XLE $XLB
227 2018-02-22 23:09:44 I will tell my reps, that’ll the ONLY thing I will aprove of! No raise of age for gun purchase, no bump-stock laws. Bump stocks aren’t even , nor have they been involved in anything since LV. This is a huge country & you can’t expect nothing will ever happen.We  CAN shoot back.
228 2018-02-22 23:09:40 I just read that Snapchat's market value on stocks dropped to the total of 1.5 billion dollars just because of that update. I wonder if someone got fired for that?
229 2018-02-22 23:09:35 Apparently you're not listening. Arming teachers is just an abhorent/ill conceived idea that is only aimed at pleasing the NRA. Raising age to 21 (average age of US mass murders is 35) & banning bump stocks (w/o the assault weapons, there's no need for them) won't solve anything.
230 2018-02-22 23:09:32 "Upside surprise" also applies to NextDC's $NXT interim report plus guidance #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
231 2018-02-22 23:09:24 Crazy that you can use Twitter for whatever you want. You can get constant breaking news on anything from sports, tech and crime to stocks, and cryptos, and real estate.

232 2018-02-22 23:08:48 ... and my  stocks need replenishing too 
233 2018-02-22 23:08:41 Only Twitter. Short all other SM stocks.
234 2018-02-22 23:08:21 Sheriff 4 Pierce County Nebraska testified n favor of bump stocks, conceal carry across the state & earlier n week threatened a colleague on FB w his weapons-
235 2018-02-22 23:08:10 @ABrindisiNY  democrats have no leadership no message there group of hate trying to destroy this country they are un American! every Democrat voted against the tax cut!  Democrats and Obama made it legal to have bumps stocks! @RepTenney @realDonaldTrump
236 2018-02-22 23:07:53 I’m a gun owner. I’m fine with eliminating assault rifles, bump stocks, and other military type artillery. Significantly amp Up background checks. But...you do also need some type of defense in the schools. Too many guns still out there. Banning a few won’t eliminate the problem
237 2018-02-22 23:07:45 Commodities rallied while the rates and stocks sold together a little with better breadth readings so far for the week. Looks like some liquidity is lining up, stocks should rally back to $SPX 2,750 for the end of month. $SPX $DBC $TLT
238 2018-02-22 23:07:41 Plus, they sold all the bump-stocks after a nazi ran over a peaceful protester and the NRA pretended like they would support banning them...cleared out all the stock before the modified triggers showed up.
239 2018-02-22 23:07:39 On CBC radio cons are mounting  “just say no,” campaign. But the fifrh Of Vodka is evidently ok with them. Perhaps why the Canadian cannibus, already super vollital stocks, are even more so. Some companies have international contracts.
240 2018-02-22 23:07:33 Pretty misleading. They aren’t picking gun stocks saying “I like these”, they have an index approach that blindly owns a very small slice of gun companies. I agree they should instead consider indexes that exclude guns, nuclear, etc. But let’s not mislead with baity headlines.
241 2018-02-22 23:07:30 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS said he stands for a ban on bump stocks and also for raising the age limit to 21; so if you're going to thank him for seeking these solutions, be a part of it and do what's right.  #WeThePeople #StudentsDemandAction
242 2018-02-22 23:07:05 I’d like to see these guys vs. American stocks one day. $250 to the highest finishers in both classes.
243 2018-02-22 23:06:47 My new band is called AK and the Bump stocks.
244 2018-02-22 23:05:25 I don't think that the GOP/NRA/Trump will do much at all. They might raise the age to legally purchase, they might get rid of legal bump stocks, but they're not going to piss the NRA off bet now and Nov. they need the campaign funds & the NRA knows it. They're also not getting
245 2018-02-22 23:05:14 Did they even propose legislation when they held a full majority in both houses? What actual legislation has Murphy ever proposed? Did he raise his voice when Obama’s ATF approves bump stocks in 2010? Always an excuse.
246 2018-02-22 23:05:07 Depends on which part of the cycle it leads. At times it makes sense and is a sign of fear dissipating . Usually it doesnt lead well to unexplored prices because the stocks are very anchored to metrics and not "story" stocks.
247 2018-02-22 23:04:28 If you play the stock game- like myself- try and hold on to your stocks for at least a year. Short-term capital gain tax is SO MUCH HIGHER than long-term. So hold those investments for one year!
248 2018-02-22 23:04:21 Bump stocks?? An accessory really. What about the AR-15?
249 2018-02-22 23:04:20 We should at least ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Have tighter background checks to try to limit wackos from buying guns.
250 2018-02-22 23:04:17 Sorry but age has nothing to to do with the shootings. Neither do bump stocks. Severe and quick punishment is@a start. Armed school employees.
251 2018-02-22 23:04:03 I think when it comes to things like the NICS system and maybe even bump stocks he would have no problem. But the Congress gets to decide for itself when it takes up legislation, not the President. But he should be using that “deal making” ability of his to push some of this
252 2018-02-22 23:03:57 we in the great commonwealth of mass have already banned bump stocks!
253 2018-02-22 23:03:40 I would also add Verizon communications and intel to the list of stocks to remove from Dow Jones
254 2018-02-22 23:03:39 Mandatory gun classes, ban on mags with 11 rounds and up, ban of bump stocks, end of online and gun show loopholes, background check reform(if you have anything other than a misdemeanor, no gun), ostracize politicians who take money from NRA, modernize ATF database.
255 2018-02-22 23:03:32 But black plastic stocks are apparently far more frightening than brown wooden stocks! (I'm surprised some envirosocialists have not tried to ban plastic as a way to eliminate most popular rifles!)
256 2018-02-22 23:03:23 Mandatory gun classes, ban on mags with 11 rounds and up, ban of bump stocks, end of online and gun show loopholes, background check reform(if you have anything other than a misdemeanor, no gun), ostracize politicians who take money from NRA, modernize ATF database.
257 2018-02-22 23:03:10 Health of pensions should never ever ever be tied to stocks! #DamnCrooks

260 2018-02-22 23:02:13 so you don't have unisex bathrooms...  and the original tweet was about bump stocks being in the constitution still carry on treacle.. take a subject about gun control an start a different discussion 
261 2018-02-22 23:00:21 We need to keep fighting.  There are more of us against having the AR 15 on the streets.  Ban this and have stricter background checks.  Get bump stocks and paraphernalia associated with AR 15 banned and confiscated.
262 2018-02-22 23:00:21 The doj is working on bump stocks. I think they'll just regulate their sales more. They won't outright ban ones that are already in private ownership.
263 2018-02-22 23:00:13 More guns is not the answer, that is a distraction from the subject of banning AR-15 and Bump stocks.  Yet, no one has offered a purpose or need for AR-15's and bump stocks.
264 2018-02-22 22:59:48 Well cadet bone spurs actually said he’s gonna push for raising the age to legally buy to 21, ban bump stocks, and crack down on background checks so if that blowhard jackass actually does it, these kids have claimed a victory
265 2018-02-22 22:59:30 No sé ve volumen, parece que los próximos días va a corregir, posiblemente testeando la resistencis. Hay se verá si hay gap y salida de los  cortos
266 2018-02-22 22:59:30 I just think these stocks have “past their time “ when it comes to being on the Dow Jones . These stocks are not good anymore and everyone knows it too
267 2018-02-22 22:59:15 $CHK $5.00 is a long way up, and arguably viable no earlier than late March. Maybe the CHK longs will get lucky with a few analyst upgrades. Far better energy stocks out there.
268 2018-02-22 22:59:03 If I say "semi-auto assault rifles, when used with bump stocks and high-cap magazines are not terribly distinguishable from fully-auto rifles, which are a thing that are banned for good reason", does the NRA still get your money?
269 2018-02-22 22:58:38 Stocks I would remove from Dow Jones : chevron , Exxon Mobil , General Electric , proctor and gamble , Johnson and Johnson , Coco-cola , Walt Disney company, and Nike
270 2018-02-22 22:57:34 Latest school shooting did not involve Bump Stocks - what's your solution?
271 2018-02-22 22:57:25 Trump directs Sessions to look into banning bump stocks so you'll think he's doing something but he is doing NOTHING.  Congress is the only body that can do something about bump stocks and they will do NOTHING.
272 2018-02-22 22:57:25 Wish you could put money behind a song before it gets big. Similar to stocks and investing in start ups. But instead of getting money when the song gets big you just get mad street cred. Anyway listen to sick boy by chain smokers.
273 2018-02-22 22:57:12 I'm saying assault rifles for a kid like that would not be accessible, people don't need semi auto guns with bump stocks to increase that speed, a gun with that kind of power is only meant to kill and random civilians having access to that power is insane
274 2018-02-22 22:57:08 imagine gun advocates being so successful at lobbying politicians that banning bump stocks is seen as a compromise
275 2018-02-22 22:56:55 @realDonaldTrump Don't ban bump fire stocks. They are not "machine guns", they simply increase fire rate, which with practice and control, I could do the same with my finger on a semi-auto weapon. Most semi's can be bump fired on their own, without a bumpstock with technique.
276 2018-02-22 22:56:47 We already have background checks. 18- buy a rifle. 21- handgun. ALREADY banned fully automatic guns. NOW, 21 for all weapons to purchase. Mental illness will be part of the background checks. Bump stocks will be banned. AR-15 will not be banned for law-abiding citizens.
277 2018-02-22 22:56:43 Ban them both! Ban them all! Handguns are fine. Ban all automatic/semi automatics and bump stocks now!! #NeverAgain #NRABloodMoney
278 2018-02-22 22:56:24 You must be tired of inaction in government after 8 years of Obama. Bump stocks, crime in Chicago, ISIS, Syria, Ukraine, Crymia, North Korea, Afghanistan, immigration, taxes. Obama's portrait describes his administration, sitting in a chair doing nothing with weeds growing around
279 2018-02-22 22:56:19 Bump stocks are just an app for assault weapons...banning just the bump stock is ridiculous!!
280 2018-02-22 22:55:46 Yes, I talked about this from June 2017 until present day and nobody appeared interested. I just bought up WY, LPX, WFT and a few other timber stocks early 3rdQ...
281 2018-02-22 22:55:35 I think the “Dow Jones’s industrial “ needs a makeover , when it comes to stocks . I do think they should replace some stocks that are one there
282 2018-02-22 22:55:13 A ban on bump stocks will only remove access from law-abiding citizens and they’re not the ones killing kids. It sure won’t prevent an evil person from having one. You know that. The focus should be on protecting the kids and any “ban” won’t accomplish that.
283 2018-02-22 22:55:06 @benebarbosa_mvb Benê, o que vc acha dessa conversa de proibir comércio dos Bump Stocks nos EUA?
284 2018-02-22 22:55:02 President Trump has real solutions...”I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!” But you won’t give him credit. You’re a Liberal. #maga #CommonSenseGunLaws
285 2018-02-22 22:54:53 2nd amendment was to allow armed militias to protect nascent nation from tyrant super power Britain as there was no standing army. Not relevant anymore. @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons AR15 AK47, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors #GunSafety
286 2018-02-22 22:54:26 We don't need more gun laws, putting guns and bump stocks only in the hands of criminals. We need better school security!!  Blaming guns is like blaming the fork for one's own weight problem. They will just turn to other methods such as bombs. Schools need much tighter security!
287 2018-02-22 22:54:20 Can states independently ban assault weapons & bumper stocks?
288 2018-02-22 22:53:58 So first you use a device that does not discriminate about fish size and type - and then complian about it when someone points out that is is ruining the fish stocks fo all species

Damn those bloody rule makers
289 2018-02-22 22:53:21 All need to review stock investment to make sure you are not invested any stocks associated with gun manufacturers. Until, they get on board with wanting responsible gun laws and denounce NRA.
290 2018-02-22 22:53:21 Assault weapons are not for hunting animals—only people. Ban them and bump stocks
291 2018-02-22 22:53:15 After a week of neither action nor words whatsoever by the ERLC, you can first start by getting off of your knees & bohunkuses & actually being proactive about calling for a ban on assault weapons, bum stocks, & anything that can be used to upgrade a gun into an assault weapon.
292 2018-02-22 22:52:52 Sorry KH, have to disagree. What are they supposed to do but peacefully raise their issue? Don’t take away all guns, just teach all to have respect for guns and limit access, especially to automatic or bump stocks.....
293 2018-02-22 22:52:38 It was your right not to wear a seat belt 40 Year’s ago but since it kills people they changed that law and guess what there are more mass shootings with assault rifles and bump stocks so they should get rid of them and all assault-rifles. Period.
294 2018-02-22 22:52:35 Tony... assault weapons are already banned... AR15 & AK’s are illegal IF THEY FIRE AUTOMATICALLY!  It’s legal to purchase any of these weapons IF THEY FIRE ONCE EVERYTIME YOU PULL THE TRIGGER.  I support banning bump stocks as well as more stringent background checks.
295 2018-02-22 22:52:35 Yea, and bump stocks functionally turn semi into auto. /shrug
296 2018-02-22 22:52:01 Being as it isn’t just bump stocks, It’s all devices that enable a higher rate of fire on semi automatics.(this can be as little as just your finger)The answer is yes. Because in the end, semi autos will be banned. We’ll live in the world of Canadian gun laws. Big picture people
297 2018-02-22 22:51:46 The Obama administration the Democrats have done nothing about the shootings the massacres except legalize bump stocks! President Trump takes a giant step to address this problem in public and one Williams says it’s not sincere! SHAME On YOU @TheFive @TheJuanWilliams @greggutfeld
298 2018-02-22 22:51:45 If you wish to continue parsing, then AT LEAST get 100% behind a ban on bump stocks.
299 2018-02-22 22:51:44 And the righty’s response? “Without our 30 round mags, bump stocks, binary triggers, how ever will we defend against the next Hitler or Stalin in this country?” So sick of that slippery slope stupidity.
300 2018-02-22 22:51:18 Were they in favor of Bump Stocks, 30 round clips, 18 year old kids who could buy AR-15s, and arming some select super hero teachers and custodians with loaded weapons with the safety off?
301 2018-02-22 22:50:27 He looks like he's been put in the stocks by the consultation process and is just waiting for the Council to throw another rotten tomato/proposal at him!
302 2018-02-22 22:50:19 NRA Conspiracy theory. Banning bump stocks is sneaky way to get rid of assault rifles. Even if it is, so what?

303 2018-02-22 22:50:18 Agree but the bump stocks are a blast to shoot.  Mental health is gonna fix more than bump sticks.  Great work tho

309 2018-02-22 22:47:54 Like put a ban on bump stocks like you did when Obama was President. Dems have failed in Chicago to stop murders and that is on you and your sanctuary City policies. Or your standing behind Black lives matter and their calls for dead cops. Your President invited them to WH.
310 2018-02-22 22:47:39 Of course no credit given for his idea of ban of butt stocks, raising the age for long guns, and harsher background checks.... gosh what was 44’s great plan after sandy hook?

314 2018-02-22 22:46:43 Do they fire faster with bump stocks?
315 2018-02-22 22:45:53 There is no reason to ban bump stocks. How many people have used them to commit these mass murders?

How many people own them in general? If you think about it u should see that having a bump stock does not make u more likely to go out & kill a bunch of people. They r not "bad".
316 2018-02-22 22:45:36 Trump wants all personnel in US movie theaters to carry machine guns with them at all times. This is to tell "the crazies" that we are tough and won't take an attack lying down. He thought that bump stocks  might be permitted in this case.
317 2018-02-22 22:45:23 Bump stocks is only a tiny start. You might want to look at what weapon is being used consistently for school shootings. #GunControlNow #BanMilitaryStyleWeaponsForCivilians

319 2018-02-22 22:45:04 No. Because before u did anything u had to contact D.C. to get permission...All so the Chinese were sent down to fight with the v.c.
 But the police action was to keep the government contractors making big money...even the toy companies got into making stocks for the ar15 , BIG $
320 2018-02-22 22:44:52 The issue at hand is protecting our kids, not banning firearms or parts thereof. If you think for a minute that a ban on bump stocks will prevent an evil doer from having access to one, think again. Criminals don’t give a rat’s ass about the rule of law.
321 2018-02-22 22:44:46 Some stocks are now valued based on their contribution to society, not on cash flow...  ie the $AMZN foundation. Still love em tho don't get me wrong.
322 2018-02-22 22:44:07 Bump stocks, get your bump stocks here!
323 2018-02-22 22:43:53 bump stocks haven’t been around since the 2nd amendment and that was made back when muskets were a thing and we needed militia for Britain invading, just because he’s taking away bump stocks doesn’t mean he’s taking away a right, you can still buy guns
324 2018-02-22 22:43:39 Quite the opposite.  The NRA loves these mass shootings because more gun purchases occur and gun makers stocks go up.  The NRA and it’s leaders are the true face of hypocrisy.
325 2018-02-22 22:43:36 1) Allow, not require, ALLOW, a school employee to conceal carry.
2) Schools hire retired police & returning servicemen for security & other jobs.
3) Put security in place similar to all other Government buildings.
4) Bump Stocks are outlawed
5) Raise the age to 21 to buy guns.

330 2018-02-22 22:42:57 That’s also why he should not try to regulate bump stocks. Force the do nothing Congress to do its job and outlaw them if that is the judgement of the people and it doesn’t violate the Constitution
331 2018-02-22 22:42:54 Also, the mods like bump stocks, cranks, suppressors. Zero legit reasons for them.
332 2018-02-22 22:42:54 Banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase and own a rifle to 21 is not going to help protect our schools. Its only taking away from the people. We give an inch and they take a mile. This is how it starts!!!!
333 2018-02-22 22:42:52 I fail to find the section in the constitution on bump stocks.

336 2018-02-22 22:41:47 Picking stocks is 100% gambling. Ppl who say otherwise are quite dumb.
337 2018-02-22 22:41:31 Where in the 2nd amendment does it say you have the right to bump stocks? Beside responding it's your right, why do you or anyone actually need one? No one is saying to take all guns away, but there's no reason for certain types of arms. Do you have the right to nuclear arms?
338 2018-02-22 22:40:48 ..but it seems like a good place to start. Other potential targets include folding stocks and other modifications designed to make a weapon more concealable or kill more people in a short amount of time.
339 2018-02-22 22:40:00 Obama ok'd bump stocks
340 2018-02-22 22:39:42 What is your position on parental control.  It’s not the guns or bump stocks, what we need is to teach our children right from wrong!  The teachers let the kids get away anything they want, they need teaching them discipline in preschool.  Don’t cave into another Obama!
341 2018-02-22 22:39:23 I CAN get behind banning bump stocks, as the only point for that device was to alter the rate of fire from semiauto to fullauto, circumventing the firearms classification. As for the magazine size, not so much. Again, whether it's a 50 or 30 round, reload times make no difference
342 2018-02-22 22:39:12 Too late, you have blood on your hands after Vegas.  If you ban bump stocks it only makes sense to ban semi-automatics.  Not only that, confiscation in order! Typical politician who refuses to go far enough.
343 2018-02-22 22:39:10 Stocks down gov is broke. Yields up gov Is broke or at least doesn't help. Essentially stocks and bond prices need to stay elevated which leaves the usd not in good shape.
344 2018-02-22 22:38:17 @realDonaldTrump What IS the need for banning bump stocks, AND WHAT IS THE NEED TO MAKE IT A FELONY TO FIRE @ A CERTAIN RATE OF SPEED? How will THIS MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER??
345 2018-02-22 22:37:55 God you are full of shit. Disavow the NRA, put forth a ban on assault rifles, propose closing the gun show loop hole, ban bump stocks, if you are mentally ill or on the no fly list or have been convicted of physically abusing someone, you can’t own a gun. Let’s see you do this.

349 2018-02-22 22:36:31 He will not be able to up the age to 21 or ban the sale of Bump Stocks because the gun lobby will threaten to pull there funding from his next election campaign
350 2018-02-22 22:36:04 If the ATF has not the authority to ban bump stocks then our leadership must act to make it so. Legislation not Confiscation. Robust background data and waiting periods combined with investment in moving mental health care away from our jails.
351 2018-02-22 22:35:58 This is the point the left says all we want is to outlaw the plastic stock guns , oh and bump stocks and 30 round clips and this and that. Oh and if we deem a person not mentally fit.. no gun , who determines it? There was a dem that's already said no war vets. They're damaged
352 2018-02-22 22:35:42 ok don't die yukito your stocks, they need you (i don't know one ((1)) thing about stocks)
353 2018-02-22 22:35:28 better there were fewer guns and more difficult to access. We do not need AR15s or bump stocks. We need  universal background checks. You words are NRA talking points aka BS.

357 2018-02-22 22:35:15 Arms =  current state of 1700/1800s weapons, not your year 2000 assault rilfles and bump stocks, so you can have your year rifle, and go jack off on it, ok?
358 2018-02-22 22:35:09 Everyone out there complaining about bump stocks becomin banned but us gamers say you just need a faster “trigger finger”
359 2018-02-22 22:34:37 Oh and a national database so everything is in 1 place including background checks. The laws should be uniform throughout the USA which would stop over state line sales. Ammunition & accessories like bump stocks too in database too. Guns should be treated like cars!
360 2018-02-22 22:34:35 Let us know which pairs, metals, indices, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc. you would like us to analyze. #LowSpread #LongTermInvestment
361 2018-02-22 22:34:00 How one way US momentum stocks have been: This is the Nasdaq's first 4-day losing streak since right before the election. The 2016 one. And the index is down 0.6% this week. $NDX
362 2018-02-22 22:33:54 Näin juuri, mutkat suoriksi niin tulee paremoi tarina. "tougher background checks that screen for mental health, raising the minimum age of buyers to 21, and ending the sale of bump stocks. Teachers carryimg guns will receive training." Nyt tapahtuu paljon lyhyessä ajassa.
363 2018-02-22 22:33:39 Like ending Bump stock sales is enough! What about the Bump stocks already sold to millions of murderers out there, who will soon carry an attack on the people?
Will you recall them back?
Your solution on gun is not a solution. How many millions of AR-15 are out there currently?

369 2018-02-22 22:33:23 Libs "bump stocks should be illegal" 

Trump "THATS IT. NO MORE BUMP STOCKS"

Libs "are you kidding me that's all you're going to do? What a racist"
370 2018-02-22 22:33:21 And in other news, #gun stocks closed up at the end of trading today. #moneytalks #dividendsoverdeadkids
371 2018-02-22 22:33:11 Did invest in gun companies CRUSH THERE STOCKS
372 2018-02-22 22:33:05 I assume you mean without #Bumpstocks. Bump stocks make them shoot really fast. Also, being a rifle with relatively small bullets, you can shoot really fast while maintaining control. Also, with large clips, you can shoot really fast for a while. Have you shot an #AR15?
373 2018-02-22 22:32:58 I can support bump stocks being covered under NFA, but not banned.
I oppose raising purchase age to 21. Considered adult @ 18, if raise purchase age to 21, then voting & military service should also be raised. Can't send children to war.
374 2018-02-22 22:32:50 the sectors I have are consumer discretionary (2 stocks), consumer staples (6), financials (2), health care (2), industrials (3), information technology (2) and materials (2)...the two financials are insurance companies
375 2018-02-22 22:32:29 Market Close: MBS +19bps; DOW +164.70; NASDAQ -8.14; S&P 500 +2.63; 10yr Treasury 2.92%; Stocks close higher, but off earlier highs and MBS closes near where it started the day.
376 2018-02-22 22:32:13 The only respectable answer imo. I don’t need guns, but I own many. Although I do agree with stricter background checks, treating owning guns like cars. Ban high cap mags, bump stocks, etc.
377 2018-02-22 22:32:04 Love to find a good mining company at 1p, hoping TYM does something big but getting over exposed now so looking for new stocks too, copper, cobalt, lithium
378 2018-02-22 22:31:37 Yes Ideas - raising the age to 21 came from the Dems, getting rid of bump stocks came from the democrats. The president wants to create a ratings system for movies and video games.  Lets see what the @POTUS VonShitHole actually DOES not what he talks about.
379 2018-02-22 22:31:35 To the guy who just took a Snapchat of my dog and I laying in academic circle, Hi you could’ve come up and pet her
380 2018-02-22 22:31:12 I don't want to ban all guns...just bump stocks and AR-15's. I own weapons myself but don't believe it's reasonable to place military grade weapons in civilian hands.
381 2018-02-22 22:31:00 Must be. I don't know enough about bump stocks to know what difference that makes, but background checks is a no-brainer
382 2018-02-22 22:30:53 That's why he made it easier for people with mental illness to purchase weapons. Hey Sid pro sports coming to Vegas , how do they feel that now he is doing something about bump stocks.
383 2018-02-22 22:30:32 1) I don’t believe one word out of Trump’s mouth. He says yesterday he will ban bump stocks and will demand stronger background checking. And today he decides he wants MORE guns (not less) in the schools. (Cont.)
384 2018-02-22 22:30:23 CLOSED FTSE100 Long Spreadbets - both I had at 7225. Banked Profit worth 0.1% of Portfolio Value. Just not happy with Charts and want to reduce Exposure - can always go Long again easily if things perk up. Fridays are often 'funny'. If Markets go up now I'm Long Stocks anyway.
385 2018-02-22 22:30:19 Bump Stocks & anything gun related is not the PROBLEM!! Leave gun stuff alone
386 2018-02-22 22:30:16 No issue with Bump Stocks but serious issue with raising the age. Provisions would have to be made for kids hunting with family but more than that if you have a 19 year old soldier, fighting in the Middle East, because he's under aged, he can't buy his own gun? NOT RIGHT!
387 2018-02-22 22:30:12 The right to bear arms was written for war not the homes, schools, churches or streets of America.  When it becomes so dangerous that the guns keep us from living lives we need to change this amendment.  It doesn’t address the guns of today or the bump stocks that kill many.
388 2018-02-22 22:30:10 For which you have zero evidence. You've ignored crime scene reports of bump stocks being used, that they produce a range of cyclical rates covering your 'analysed' rate, and no evidence of this mythical M240.
389 2018-02-22 22:29:53 Es tan perverso el tema que muchos colombianos creen que Colombia es tan riesgo en inseguridad alimentaria, cuando toda la vida los stocks los han manejado 4 familias a su antojo. Eso es más riesgoso.
390 2018-02-22 22:29:34 Please show me where someone killed or wounded hundreds from Las Vegas Hotel ..by throwing Bud Lights and Packs of Marlboro's out the window..nope..it was a mentally ill man w/ an assault weapon(s) with bump stocks.. raining thousands of,bullets at innocent people ..
391 2018-02-22 22:29:00 Idk I gotta disagree. I think he’s trying to work bipartisan, as well as get them to stfu. Plus I kinda don’t see the point in banning fully-auto weapons but make devices that turn semi-auto into full-auto. Plus I don’t think he’s supporting actually banning ARs, just bump stocks
392 2018-02-22 22:28:55 @realDonaldTrump AR-15 is not an assault riffle. In fact the word was created. Just like bump stocks. Their are no machine guns Sir.
393 2018-02-22 22:28:53 Too bad he never did anything to help. Except exacerbate the problem by legalizing bump stocks. Now, we finally have real @POTUS
394 2018-02-22 22:28:41 Good?  I'm going to have to ask myself. I know of someone that stocks his private pond with them. All I remember is that they don't reproduce for him.
395 2018-02-22 22:28:28 Arming teachers sounds like the President makes more money if the gun manufacturers sell more guns. Wonder how many gun stocks he owns? But that is hidden from the public. He is so out of integrity.
396 2018-02-22 22:28:19 Could support all this but the bump stocks.  Dont infringe on our rights.
397 2018-02-22 22:28:10 So now you're trying to justify the continued sales of bump stocks as, what, a safety measure? I think your beanie is a few sizes too small.
398 2018-02-22 22:28:09 He can't end the sale of bump stocks without Congress.  Pure window dressing.
399 2018-02-22 22:27:36 But a bump stock like in the Vegas shooting can make that AR-15 an automatic (or at least make it fire more than 1 bullet per trigger pull). At least regulate bump stocks and the larger 50 round clips that have been found on mass shooters after these incidents.
400 2018-02-22 22:26:59 @realDonaldTrump Hey Donald, dont ban bump stocks!  Thats a win for the anti gun crowd.  We do support abolishing gun free zones and arming teachers.
401 2018-02-22 22:26:45 @nakedbedco as a Liberal I would approve that. Keep all the handguns you want just cut the bump stocks, hi capacity clips and anything that can allow you to kill more efficiently. Only soldiers should do that.
402 2018-02-22 22:26:41 Bump stocks! You can replicate bump stocks with a belt! R u going to ban belts too! #StuckonStupid #2ndAmendment #Liberty
403 2018-02-22 22:26:27 Here's to hoping you find the "caps lock", "apostrophe", "comma", and "period" keys on your computer soon.  And btw, the people that I talk to want assault rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks banned.  No one that I know is saying they "want guns completely abolished"
404 2018-02-22 22:25:20 they're not Trump's ideas ... NRA, Breitbart, etc... Not re-instate the assault weapon ban, improve background check, keep guns from menally ill, eliminate bump stocks ... all DEM ideas, just too close to Columbine
405 2018-02-22 22:25:00 In the United States we have a god-given write two free thought and making a decision to do something comes with consequences. everybody should carry a firearm as long as they have not committed a violent crime. if there are bump stocks have fun, commit a crime suffer consequence
406 2018-02-22 22:24:44 ARs aren’t illegal in CA. Just certain aspects are. (Extending stocks, detachable mags, high capacity mags, etc.)
407 2018-02-22 22:24:39 Hi. Thanks for getting back to me. 
So does it matter if the cash ISA and the stocks and shares ISA are with different providers?
408 2018-02-22 22:24:38 Bump stocks are ghey but this is the beginning of some bull shit. Give an in and the gun grabbers will take a mile. ATF already ruled on them. #bumpstocks
409 2018-02-22 22:24:23 Don't ban bump stocks!!!!! Seriously.
410 2018-02-22 22:24:22 Doesn't mention how much the NRA bosses, the arms industry,  loves mass shootings because sales and stocks go up.
411 2018-02-22 22:24:22 Well, banning bump stocks isn’t actually his idea, but the republicans and NRA will block that one (again), and arming teachers is a stupid idea so he’s welcome to claim that idea as his own.
412 2018-02-22 22:24:05 WHAT THE HELL DO PEOPLE NEED BUTT STOCKS FOR??   THIS IS TOTALLY STUPID.    WHY DOES ANY PERSON IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC NEED AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.    THE ONLY REASON MOST PEOPLE HAVE WEAPONS, IS TO HUNT.   THERE IS NO REASON FOR MILITARY WEAPONS IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
413 2018-02-22 22:23:44 About taking away the second amendment!!! But background checks in common DB....don’t sell weapons of war and you wouldn’t need stocks or large magazine
..
414 2018-02-22 22:23:11 wealth inequality 101:  “subprime consumers” take extra discretionary income and spend it food, booze and shit they can’t afford while “prime consumers” take extra discretionary income and invest it in alcohol distributors, subprime lenders and restaurant stocks.  rinse/repeat.
415 2018-02-22 22:22:34 @tilly_rachal I'm following you because of the sheer stupidity I saw you deal with (referring to bump stocks). I mean that was something. You deserve something for dealing with it. Even if it's just one more follower.
416 2018-02-22 22:22:33 Offensive, insulting, misguided, and incorrect are all stocks in trade for the NRA and Republicans.
417 2018-02-22 22:22:25 Obama's administration approved bump stocks...
418 2018-02-22 22:22:09 Anybody know how to buy #Libyan stocks?

Bump stocks & age are NO BRAINERS opposed ONLY by gun seller lobbyist NRA. Real action? We'll see!
421 2018-02-22 22:21:45 Just sent a Red alert for stocks, bond, crytos, etc
422 2018-02-22 22:21:36 Naw, it was a slow-growing mycobacterium strain.. would have just had glycerol stocks made by then.
423 2018-02-22 22:21:35 I think it's an ad hoc combination of capitalizing nouns that are specific ("Bump Stocks", "Mental Health" as opposed to "many people", "this issue") and nouns that are 'important' ("Great People", "Country").
424 2018-02-22 22:21:19 Great idea? Pistol against full body armour and weapon of war ar15....
Has everyone lost any ounce of common sense....no one said anything about changing second amendment! Stop selling assault rifles and you wouldn’t need stocks or change the size of the magazine.
425 2018-02-22 22:21:19 I thought btc has gone up with stocks the last couple years
426 2018-02-22 22:21:14 So, is it not true that most NRA members don't agree with the NRA agenda? Ie, no background checks, no ban on bump stocks etc? Honestly curious. I see polls that indicate most Americans, incl. NRA members aren't in agreement w NRA goals.
427 2018-02-22 22:21:11 Topic was about $ROKU .. not other stocks.
428 2018-02-22 22:20:52 If they want bump stocks and rapid fire laws, give me voter ID.
429 2018-02-22 22:20:49 What is the biggest risk facing stocks right now ?
430 2018-02-22 22:20:29 Universal checks for Gun/Ammo buyers, strengthening sentences for illegal gun possession, get rid of bump stocks, Bar sales to people deemed dangerous by mental health provider, centralize gun sales, limit sales long guns, age requirement (21), 3 day waiting period."
431 2018-02-22 22:20:15 should read "Your mental health; raise your IQ. to 21; and get rid of your Bum Stocks"
432 2018-02-22 22:20:07 The drop is too small to hold any meaning, lockheed martins stocks have been growing steadily for years now
433 2018-02-22 22:19:48 OMG... someone tell this idiot to stfu! We love our country, the 2nd Amendment and don't want take away your guns. I don't want bump stocks, large capacity clips and military style weapons on the streets.
434 2018-02-22 22:19:45 yukito who breaks into your house, invests in stocks, and writes questionable essays
435 2018-02-22 22:19:36 Founding father's knew about bump stocks and automatic weapons?  It's good to learn from history, it's bad to repeat it.
436 2018-02-22 22:19:35 That's exactly what they were betting on, which is why the execution is on the back burner. The huge influx of new customers thinking they would get easy crypto access  fills their pocket in the meantime from buying stocks while "waiting...." Genius!
437 2018-02-22 22:19:29 Ban bump stocks: Those things that had nothing to do with the Florida  shooting, but that you hope will make this mess go away without affecting your NRA donations.
438 2018-02-22 22:19:29 Bump stocks had nothing to do with this shooting. Please ban assault weapons. No one but police or active duty military need that much fire power.
439 2018-02-22 22:19:26 I own guns. I learned the responsibility of that beginning at the age of six. I believe in the 2nd. I don’t believe that the NRA should define policy. A robust background database, waiting period and elimination of stupidity like bump stocks makes sense. Govt by lobbies does not
440 2018-02-22 22:19:15 Waaay to extreme for me. That’s way to far. I agree no bump stocks. I don’t agree that reasonable citizens who own a gun that are very responsible, need to lose their rights. Mental health help must also be implicated, especially for troubled people. Have a good evening.
441 2018-02-22 22:19:05 What a great time to be alive, #MAGA @rosie DEAR FUCKING CONCERN TROLLS: Trump offered bump stocks because the response from the left will be, "It's not enough." It's the same strategy used with the Palestinians. Neither of them wants peace. They want complete victory or noth...
442 2018-02-22 22:18:56 Commend the president for suggesting stronger background checks and banning bump stocks. Does it solve everything? Of course not. But I think both of those things need to happen. And if they actually do happen, I’ll commend him and whoever makes it happen even more.
443 2018-02-22 22:18:51 Bull crap. Let's see the laws to ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and guns that accept high capacity magazines. Until then just shut up.
444 2018-02-22 22:18:42 Increased background checks w/fingerprints, raise age to legal 21 (ATF), and BAN semi assault weapons and bump stocks!
445 2018-02-22 22:18:41 Today: 30+ emails, compared 6 price quotes for a rental car, stalked a couple stocks to will them to hit my target prices (to no avail)
446 2018-02-22 22:18:23 Oil rigs + drilling have already made 
impact on fishing stocks. Before the oil business there were sharks

447 2018-02-22 22:18:12 How many rounds in a pistol? How many attachments are available like bump stocks for pistols... why is the AW style of rifle used by soldiers instead of a hunting rifle? 
I hope you have a back up plans as the young adults will not forget? NRA
448 2018-02-22 22:18:12 That "ban" was never actually law, it was an executive order.  However, you think bring back a ban on collapsible stocks, pistil grips and bayonet mounts really makes something an "assault" rifle and will stop illegal shootings?
449 2018-02-22 22:17:55 @chucktodd Bump stock was used in one massacre, AR15s have been used in many..banning bump stocks wont do anything
450 2018-02-22 22:17:45 Hi @piersmorgan before ya write the next article thinking You had something to do with the presidents decision on bump stocks, ya didn't big head.
451 2018-02-22 22:17:45 If a person 19 years old is not competent to have a rifle than they are not compentent to vote or join the military. Bump stocks should go.
452 2018-02-22 22:17:12 That's weird saying you have their backs. Your reaction to Sandy Hook? Legalizing Bump Stocks. You, Barack, have done NOTHING. It took a real president to listen to the masses to start making changes. Grateful you are gone. Nothing but crime in your wake, a cesspool of an admin.
453 2018-02-22 22:16:53 A look at 10 stocks billionaires have been buying and selling...
454 2018-02-22 22:16:26 1) Allow, not require, ALLOW, school employees to conceal carry.
2) Schools hire retired police & returning servicemen for security & other jobs.
3) Put security in place similar to all other Government buildings.
4) Bump Stocks are outlawed
5) Raise the age to 21 to buy guns.
455 2018-02-22 22:16:21 From hitting licks to trading stocks what a change we have made lmaooooo
456 2018-02-22 22:16:17 I guess adjustable stocks are going to be super duper illegal now
457 2018-02-22 22:15:55 Sold most of my stocks (FAANG) for good profit. Sitting on Fiat now. Thanks for the heads up, Waiting for Robinhood Crypto invite to invest more into crypto (BTC/ETH - $$$)
458 2018-02-22 22:15:41 I am strongly pushing for a Comprehensive Background Check on Trump with an emphasis on Mental Health. Attempt to Raise his mental capacity to an age of at least 21 and end sale of Trump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
459 2018-02-22 22:15:23 It’s not your right to have bump stocks.  It’s our kids right to live. Right to life.
460 2018-02-22 22:15:19 Meanwhile, how many AR-15s and bump stocks are there already out there, and maybe in the hands of the next mass murderer?
461 2018-02-22 22:15:12 Elimination of bump stocks is no big loss. They are simply a novelty that burns far too many rounds. There are other options that simulate the same effect but are way more accurate anyway.

There's always a better mousetrap!
462 2018-02-22 22:14:51 My rule for making $$ is akin to Buffett's rule #1:  "Only buy the stocks that will going up, never buy the ones that will go down."
463 2018-02-22 22:14:43 1) Allow, not require, ALLOW, a school employee to conceal carry.
2) Schools hire retired police & returning servicemen for security & other jobs.
3) Put security in place similar to all other Government buildings.
4) Bump Stocks are outlawed
5) Raise the age to 21 to buy guns.
464 2018-02-22 22:14:34 I agree with that! I believe gun people would have no problem banning things like bump stocks because things like that aren’t popular among shooters. Really we need our government to quit dropping the ball.
465 2018-02-22 22:14:32 Some pics from a Brilliant new book on the shelves of all leading book shops now - while stocks last!
466 2018-02-22 22:14:08 Bump stocks are not your right.
467 2018-02-22 22:14:06 I'm a gun owner and even have an AR-15 locked away in my gun safe. But there is no reason for these bump stocks to be purchasable. Trump is doing the right thing.
468 2018-02-22 22:14:05 Bump stocks are a part of the arms it gives us the right to bear! Now lay the hell off our guns in any form!
469 2018-02-22 22:14:04 She is right. Automatic rifles are illegal or by special permit only. Assault rifles can be altered with bump stocks or other items that can make them fire automatically. AR stands for ArmaLite Rifle if memory serves me right, a co in the 40-50s that made the AR-15   Now u know
470 2018-02-22 22:13:15 We’ll see what happens.   Raising legal age and getting rid of bump stocks ( why did obama allow those?) sounds reasonable.  Eliminating gun-free zones makes sense.  Why be a sitting duck unarmed in a gunfree zone?
471 2018-02-22 22:13:14 Inflationary for consumer goods and commodities.  Deflationary for bonds, real estate, and most non-commodity related stocks.
472 2018-02-22 22:13:13 Hi! Good morning! All the accounts na nabayaran kagabi, bibigay ko po later before lunch. I just got home po galing sa pagawa ng thesis and wala pa po akong tulog and nasaktuhan na wala pong stocks. Tulog ng konti then mag rerestock na po ako until sunday. Thank you!_
473 2018-02-22 22:13:12 Obama’s decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law during his reign.
474 2018-02-22 22:13:00 Oh and FYI bump stocks weren’t used in the Florida shooting.
475 2018-02-22 22:12:44 Does the NRA support bump stocks, abolishing background checks, and the unrestricted sale of automatic weapons? Then they are the moderates.
476 2018-02-22 22:12:27 @hodgman The first STOCKS segment was still ringing in my ears. Some random passes by and directs me to smile. Your recent public shaming gives me the push to calmly chastise him and not get flustered when he tries to argue. NO SMILES, ONLY JUSTICE! Thanks!
477 2018-02-22 22:12:26 Bread, tea & bogroll stocks OK?
478 2018-02-22 22:12:19 WE need Blackrock ETFS to stop investing in Bump Stocks
479 2018-02-22 22:12:04 The legal reason for bump stocks is the same reason for the 2nd amendment in the first place.  The right to bear arms was so that the citizens could overthrow their government should it be necessary.  The first step in tyranny is the confiscation of all guns.
480 2018-02-22 22:11:56 Ps  ... just found out governor of FL & others (cowards) have their finger prints on gun stocks for teachers retirement fund in FL.
481 2018-02-22 22:11:54 Teachers can't take a tax deduction on supplies 4 their students but no doubt if this GOP admin had it's way they would revise the #TaxScam to make AKs, Black Talons, & bump stocks fully deductible.
Trump and his disgraceful traitors will pay. Woman, kids & Mueller will C 2 that.
482 2018-02-22 22:11:46 Yeah, i dont get the excitement for bump stocks. If I cant defend my home semi or drop an animal with one shot. Then that's a failure to me.
483 2018-02-22 22:11:41 Name one thing you did to try and pass any law strengthening gun laws.  You controlled Congress for 6 years. You now control the white house as well.  Did you object to bump stocks at the time?
484 2018-02-22 22:11:32 Tbh can't wait to be back on the court.  #firstroundofdistricts
485 2018-02-22 22:11:31 Not a fan of open carry.  It makes people nervous and you're the first person thugs shoot.  Current laws must start to be enforced.  Bump stocks have no practical use.  Some places should disallow CHL/LTC (police dept, military facilities, airports)
486 2018-02-22 22:11:29 Hey don't play about them stocks
487 2018-02-22 22:11:10 Conceptually I'm not against that. I don't trust anybody, let alone Congress, to properly enact something like that that doesn't take away rights from fit citizens but I'm not conceptually against it. I am against the banning of bump stocks and raising the age though
488 2018-02-22 22:11:10 Trump tweeted he wants to raise the age to 21 and ban bump stocks.
489 2018-02-22 22:11:03 The NRA is a terrorist organization that prioritizes gun sales over the lives of children. We need to ban semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, and strengthen background checks.
490 2018-02-22 22:10:37 Who needs bump stocks....seriously...I'm all for guns..but bump stock are bad.
491 2018-02-22 22:10:34 You've completely missed the point. I have no problem if bump stocks were forever removed. However, they are easily made at home and have a crappy record for accuracy. And again I ask, why would they stop there? You give a little, they keep pushing. One day you'll understand
492 2018-02-22 22:10:30 Tell me about how they fire with bump stocks?  Clarify also why they are the preferred rifle for hunting humans.  Clarify also why the CDC isn’t allowed to research gun violence to help find ways to stop this.
493 2018-02-22 22:10:12 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
494 2018-02-22 22:10:10 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! by #cccp3o
495 2018-02-22 22:10:08 Knives kill six times more than guns and hundreds of times more than guns with bump stocks.  We need full background checks, registration, and zero tolerance for all knives. Stop the madness....
496 2018-02-22 22:10:07 My favourite things to make in a Crock-Pot are pot roast and stocks. Been making a ton of stocks lately. Save all the bones from meals and freeze them until I got enough. Especially chicken/turkey. But pork and beef bones are good too
497 2018-02-22 22:10:04 Personally, bump stocks are just ridiculous, its an attachment item. Unwieldy and makes shooting less accurate. But for argument sake, there is much yet we don’t know about the Vegas shooting but with what we do, bump stocks weren’t the cause, the real issue.
498 2018-02-22 22:10:03 @realDonaldTrump If someone can go to war when they're 18 yrs. old, they can certainly own a weapon. Raising the age limit is unconstitutional. You're also trying to use bump-stocks as a pawn for strategic sacrifice. President Trump, you're not in New York anymore. Stop this shit
499 2018-02-22 22:09:44 What, like laser sights, NV goggles and bump stocks? Get the fuck out of here, you merchant of death, treachery and disease.
500 2018-02-22 22:09:37 Breaking (5:09 PM EST): Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Wingstop & more... -- CNBC
501 2018-02-22 22:09:29 Outlawing bump stocks is not the answer Mr  President. I think you are wasting your time on this. Please put the guns in the school. Putting the age at 21 is not the answer. More gun laws are not the answer.  @realDonaldTrump
502 2018-02-22 22:09:14 The people who spend the millions to keep guns laws where they are will lose out on sales and stocks. They feel tougher laws and better background checks will not allow them to buy weapons they have no need for.
503 2018-02-22 22:09:09 No signature reason for the Dow’s rolling. Savants believe just a general fear of inflation and concurrently higher rates is weighing on stocks. Lots of chatter about the return of the 60’s Fab 50 and concentration. We don’t like these sloppy closes.
504 2018-02-22 22:09:05 $MTSL is a low float and it is getting accumulated now...on close watch for tomorrow imo
505 2018-02-22 22:09:02 #StudentsStandUp Ban Bump Stocks  Ban Assault Weapons  NEXT. Ban Black Market  won’t work if you don’t ban all 3! #Logic right? #Realist
506 2018-02-22 22:08:52 Given they initially offered support on a ban on bump stocks only to later change their mind, I’d regard any deal made with them to be as ironclad as the one Lando made with Vader.
507 2018-02-22 22:08:46 honestly they banned the sale of surprise eggs so they can ban bump stocks.  I wouldn't support banning a style of gun beyond what is already illegal.  mental health does need to be addressed
508 2018-02-22 22:08:40 He has not done anything no EO or law on anything. Bum stocks legislation die in Congress and that was not his bill. Obama sign an EO banning people with mental issues from buying guns Trump reverse that. Obama sent a bill to Congress after newtown to ban assault weapon and lost.
509 2018-02-22 22:08:20 @POTUS - also get ARMED
GUARDS in schools please

(allow teachers to concealed carry
 if qualified)
.
besides age to 21YO 2buy
ban bump stocks
mental health, &
strong background chec

BUT MAIN THING SHOULD
BE ***ARMED GUARDS***

510 2018-02-22 22:07:57 Heeeeeeeyyyy I wanna plummet some random stocks with a tweet too!
511 2018-02-22 22:07:48 1.) This move is preventative. Bump stocks cause a lot more harm than good. 2.) bump stocks were the exact tool that enabled the Las Vegas shooter to rack up such a high death toll so quickly.
512 2018-02-22 22:07:28 @WhiteHouse IMO shorters using paranoia to crash stocks while in reality Walmart sales/revenue are up, GE is cleaning up ,5G E-Commerce is moving on & @SpaceX nail it again w/ Broadband satellites & reusable Rockets.Cover Rural American Continent w/ these US  Satellites ? World?
513 2018-02-22 22:07:23 The NRA has never been against background checks, nor do they support bump stocks they implemented them when Clinton tried to give just a 7 day waiting period... the 21 thing in your statement is true however.
514 2018-02-22 22:07:15 I have no problem with limiting clip size to something smaller than 30 rounds in a clip, and banning bump stocks. No problem with having them need to transport unloaded with gun and ammo in separate locked cases. I’m against an outright ban cause it has been available for 57.
515 2018-02-22 22:07:11 They'll prob supply them with billers, holsters, stocks, and scopes. It will be like they're playing cod
516 2018-02-22 22:07:00 Banning bump stocks is just another 2A right being taken away and besides I can rapid fire an AR or AK or any other semi by just using my finger and a belt loop Are the loony liberals going to ban belt loops? Mr. President I am one of many asking you not to cave on 2A rights!
517 2018-02-22 22:06:42 You're talking out of two sides of your mouth there, Don...first it's "ban bump stocks " then an hour later, the NRA is great, then you go back to School Safety....you're so transparent! You spin like a tired top, wobbling all over the place.
518 2018-02-22 22:06:42 This discussion should be about changes that make sense, not taking guns. More along the lines of: eliminate bump stocks & high capacity magazines,  better background checks & mandatory safety training & raising age limits to purchase.
519 2018-02-22 22:06:22 Armed Guards not Teachers in Schools. Age 21. REAL background checks. Hold FBI accountable for follow up. No B Stocks!
520 2018-02-22 22:06:11 Why does it matter?  They basically do what their voters want.  I agree, nobody needs guns like an AR-15.  If they continue to sell them, limit the magazines.  Do away with bump stocks.  If they are not available, it would prevent murders like this.
521 2018-02-22 22:06:08 With bump stocks it's worse. I saw the article listing each autopsy from Vegas shootings. It was pretty horrific.
522 2018-02-22 22:06:05 Bump stocks are one of many ways to turn a semi auto to full auto, rotating triggers, binary triggers etc. The language should say anything that alters the one squeeze one bullet is illegal.
523 2018-02-22 22:06:04 @POTUS then DELIVER Universal Background checks-NO exceptions for gun shows/private owners! BAN by LAW Bump Stocks/similar equipment! BAN by LAW automatic/semi automatic weapons! Gun violence is a GUN problem! No one wants to take away hunting weapons/most handguns! Common Sense!
524 2018-02-22 22:05:41 Saw it, liked how you handled it.  You weren't afraid to refute when they got silly. Let's end the war on objects like goofy bump stocks and focus on the murderers who will kill regardless of what you try to ban.  Must stop making targets out of our schools with 'gun free zones'
525 2018-02-22 22:05:35 You’re a bit misinformed. First President Obama personality went to the Funerals, second try to amend bump stocks and assault rifles who interfered the GOP!
526 2018-02-22 22:05:29 No civilian should have military style weapons. No one should have bump stocks or bump fire mechanisms. These guns are devastating and too easily accessible. Police at schools are armed.
527 2018-02-22 22:05:10 Wait -- am I hearing correctly that it was the OBAMA ADMINISTRATION that approved of bump stocks? What? When will @CNN broadcast this embarrassing little fact. Ooop. Forgot. @CNN doesn't broadcast facts. @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump
528 2018-02-22 22:05:01 30+++ round mags with bump stocks or tigger modifications can VERY easily make it an assault rifle, this is fact
529 2018-02-22 22:04:45 What happened to you wanting to ban bump stocks? I knew I shouldn’t have stayed positive on that. Shame on you.
530 2018-02-22 22:04:30 Bump stocks do not turn semi-automatic rifles into automatic rifles.
Why are you talking about this topic?
531 2018-02-22 22:04:14 If you think you’ll win 2020 while trying to raise fairearm purchasing age,  you are wrong. And banning bump stocks(which won’t solve issue) is ridiculous capitulation without gain.

534 2018-02-22 22:04:10 Set aside the issue of whether bump stocks should be outlawed (I think they should). Trump cannot just decide to ban through the JD.

CONGRESS MAKES LAWS not the executive. Obama did this all the time & it was an outrage. It was unconstitutional then, it’s unconstitutional now.
535 2018-02-22 22:04:02 Bump stocks are a novelty. Useless plastic gimmick and a waste of money. You waste your money when you buy it and waste it again with the ammunition you expend while using it.
536 2018-02-22 22:03:53 The law has nothing to do with bump stocks turning semi weapons into auto weapons
537 2018-02-22 22:03:39 totally expecting you to walk back your call for ban on bump stocks any time now, just as your NRA overlords dictate.....

543 2018-02-22 22:02:42 The 2nd Amendment only mentions arms, not ammunition and accessories, such as high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. Can’t we control the sale and usage of these without violating the Constitution?  Love your podcasts!
544 2018-02-22 22:02:42 Re-enact restrictions against sales to those w/ dangerous mental illness

551 2018-02-22 22:01:42 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, your proposals to raise the age to legally buy a rifle to 21, to ban bump stocks, and to deny the right to own a gun if there's any kind of mental illness are both ineffective and unconstitutional! Please reconsider. I've supported you till now.

560 2018-02-22 22:00:53 So your argument is you have the right to kill a living being before it's born but it's wrong to protect oneself from a fully formed human trying to kill You? I don't understand the need for bump stocks either but common sense please.

563 2018-02-22 21:59:48 I'm referring to any weapon other than a single-shot handgun or rifle. This includes items, like bump stocks or other items that can be added to guns to turn them into killing machines!
564 2018-02-22 21:59:46 School safety? What about reasonable limits to gun ownership, bump stocks, and magazine size.  I work in a school. To say we need armed teachers in schools is ludicrous. Imagine trying to take out a shooter with 20 of your kindergarteners crying and running around.
565 2018-02-22 21:59:26 Teacups again calling penny stocks scams but the ones you promote are as clean as a whistle right??  
THEY ARE ALL SCAMS NOBODY IS PUTTING THEM IN THEIR ROTH IRA TO REPLACE SOCIAL SECURITY WHEN THEY HIT FULL RETIREMENT AGE SO PLEASE KNOCK IT OFF ALREADY WOULD YA! $MINE
566 2018-02-22 21:58:50 Yeah but with a semi-automatic they can just spray bullets everywhere so accuracy isn’t really that important. They could even provide the teachers with bump stocks
567 2018-02-22 21:58:42 Emailing our reps today—in two weeks need laws passed—giant funding for school security remodel, raise age for high powered rifles from 18 to 21, no bump stocks, deeper background checks, stiffer local/state reporting to feds so crazies can’t get any guns. Anything to add?
568 2018-02-22 21:58:30 Sorry to burst your bubble but with just a little knowledge and 1hour any semi auto and hand gun can be made fully automatic. Anyone angry can do this. Bump stocks mean  nothing.Thank you
569 2018-02-22 21:58:23 Wow that's funny, stop pumping stocks @mafiadaytrading! hahahaha .. on a more serious note, well done for passing $80K !!!! Awesome day for you in this shitty market

571 2018-02-22 21:58:18 TRUMP asked;"Y do we need Bump Stocks?" I ask; Why R Ed&Elaine Brown in Prison 4 obeying SCOTUS rulings IncTaxes DON'T APPLY?
572 2018-02-22 21:58:17 Bruhhhh leave the bump stocks alone.....
573 2018-02-22 21:57:58 But it's NOT your right. Please point out where in the Constitution it says "the government shall not ban the sale or transfer of bump stocks". 

Oh, wait. It doesn't say that. 

It says the militia shall be "well regulated".
574 2018-02-22 21:57:48 And I don't recall any of the students in Florida being affected by bump stocks. Why are they talking about that as a solution now? It's just a distraction to respond. It's only a partial measure. No half-measures!
575 2018-02-22 21:57:37 @washingtonpost  on stocks, public should be aware of NRA, manufacturers, etc that are in ETFs and other types of funds....also, gun owners who are responsible should encourage alternative groups such as in Oregon...
576 2018-02-22 21:57:16 He makes somewhere between $5 and $6 million per year. He must be the voice for those manufacturers. After mass shootings gun sales go up and up. After Las Vegas they couldn't keep bump stocks on the shelves.
577 2018-02-22 21:56:56 Hi, I'm AH. Thanks for getting in touch. You're able to transfer funds into a cash ISA and a stocks & shares ISA within the same tax year, as long as you don't exceed the ISA allowance for the year. Hope this helps.
578 2018-02-22 21:56:42 @lapierre your a total ass. Most people just want bump stocks and assault weapons banned. No issue with rifles or guns in general. You took advantage and went to extreme with speech
579 2018-02-22 21:56:42 @NRA lapierre turned speech around into garbage. No one wants 2nd amendment gone, just assault weapons and bumps stocks. Neither are necessary for personal safety or hunting.
580 2018-02-22 21:56:23 I wasn't trying to provide a lesson.  I'm curious as to how common bump stocks actually are . . . I see it as nothing more than a novelty that might be fun for a mag dump or two.  Folks can also do that with a thumb in their belt loop.
581 2018-02-22 21:56:07 @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump shouldn’t worry about bump stocks or increase the age to buy guns. AMERICA DOESNT HAVE A GUN PROBLEM.  This will not sit well with The people who elected the President. Sessionsneed to be going #CrookedHillary instead..
582 2018-02-22 21:55:56 The good- comprehensive background checks. The bad- raising gun sales age to 21. The ugly- banning bump stocks
583 2018-02-22 21:55:52 Ban them! They also can be used as "Bump Stocks"!!!!
584 2018-02-22 21:55:41 Bump stocks aren’t the problem. It’s not like they’re a prolific problem. The problem is democrats make more money in contributions after tragedies so they don’t want to fix the problem
585 2018-02-22 21:55:36 @essentialcuisin wanna send us out some samples of all these new stocks and sauces 
586 2018-02-22 21:55:34 How about banning semi-automatic guns? Or eliminating peer to peer sales? Or eliminating trade show sales? Or increasing the age to purchase guns?  Bump stocks won't stop what happened in Florida or Texas.
587 2018-02-22 21:55:32 Oh you mean bump stocks. 

I understand your thought on the subject. 

And while no gun death is acceptable, there are 330,000,000+ (ya, million) guns in U.S. And ~13,500 annual firearm homicides.

~ 0.0000042 % of the number of guns here.. So 99.99% aren't used to murder people.
588 2018-02-22 21:55:30 Bump stocks are not a right. Neither are all guns. The Supreme Court has already ruled on this. Educate yourself.
589 2018-02-22 21:55:15 Bump stocks, form what I can tell, would be immensely easy to 3-D print.

Making them illegal would certainly thwart law-abiding citizens from possessing one but also create a new financial incentive for law-breakers to make them.
590 2018-02-22 21:55:03 I’ no history buff, but I’m pretty sure neither bump stocks nor semi-automatic weapons existed in the 1700s
591 2018-02-22 21:54:52 George, really not in the mood for your ignorance today. Jobless claims hit another historic low. Stocks. GDP. Manufac back in USA. Tax cuts. Companies bringing money investing. Afric Am unemployment all time lows. His approval is higher than Obamas at the same point. Just stop!
592 2018-02-22 21:54:44 Bump Stocks are no more responsible than load absorbing shocks for Drunk Driving. This is stupid ...
593 2018-02-22 21:54:42 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Red flag laws allowing court order to remove weapons from disturbed individuals
3. Universal background checks for dealer as well as private sales
4. High capacity magazine ban
5. No guns for those on terror watch list

Why are these things unreasonable?

595 2018-02-22 21:54:03 The stock is interchangeable, neither is more powerful, faster, easier to shoot, more accurate. Changing stocks make about as much different as a putting fancy wheels on your car or truck.

597 2018-02-22 21:54:00 @corbydavidson @theoldgreywolf bitcoin has not collapsed. its going through a correction like stocks do. Bitcoin has dipped at the beginning of the year for the past 4 years. It's pretty normal for that to happen, and now is the time to invest if you're smart, or want to.
598 2018-02-22 21:54:00 To Marco Rubio....bump stocks and from 19 to 21 on the sale of assault weapons...big friggin deal an idiot could come to that conclusion...
599 2018-02-22 21:53:45 The best bond funds for rising interest rates are not guarantees of positive returns in that kind of economic environment but these types of bond funds do have lower interest rate risk than most other types of bond funds.

600 2018-02-22 21:53:38 What does rapid fire capability mean? An AR 15 doesn't fire a significant amount faster than a handgun unless you modify it, in which case the goal should be targeting those mods like bump stocks

603 2018-02-22 21:53:09 Bump Stocks are no more responsible than load absorbing shocks for Drunk Driving. This is stupid ...
604 2018-02-22 21:51:26 How about banning WMD’s?If a threat’s missed,kill count goes down.Quit making excuses for NRA. They’ve got blood & brain matter on their hands as do you.Tell me anything they’ve done to make us safer.They won’t even support banning bump stocks,Kevlar bullets or studying the prob.
605 2018-02-22 21:51:26 What conditions will be disqualifying?
Devil is in the details.

We don't trust government when they start messing with our constitutional rights. 

He will have to be very precise. 

Bump stocks are junk.
606 2018-02-22 21:51:25 Do you ever research if the politicians that are pro-NRA also hold stocks in gun manufactures?

608 2018-02-22 21:50:14 its the MARK of a MANIPULATED market ... VERY THIN ... stocks with virtually zero inherent value
609 2018-02-22 21:50:10 Well it was shares.  But yeah, shares in a company that's never made a profit.  Tech stocks smell of dotcom.

611 2018-02-22 21:49:44 Obama claiming top have the marcher's "backs". It is a shame he didn't have the kids at Sandy Hook's backs-Obama did NOTHING after all the shootings in his 8 years in office, but he did approve Bump Stocks.
Worst president in history.
612 2018-02-22 21:49:43 America can keep small fire arms and other guns. We just dont want bump stocks or powerful rifles to be given to anyone. We want regulation, simple yearly checks, saftey lessons, and background checks.
613 2018-02-22 21:48:59 My colleague has inherited $14,000, so he asks me “ Sean you are into your stocks & shares and stuff , what do you think I should do with the money ?”  I told him play it safe & put it into #xrp #ltc but it got me thinking what would you do? Feel free to message other coins/ico.
614 2018-02-22 21:48:41 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @POTUSPressPool You promised us that you would protect the 2nd Amendment. I hope and pray to God almighty that you do not go back on your word. President Donald Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday to finalize plans to ban bump stocks,

616 2018-02-22 21:48:07 Banning bumo stocks and blaming video games wont help anything. Jave better armed security at public school and allow teachers to conceal carry.

618 2018-02-22 21:47:34 Ya know, I am a strong follower of you Mr. Trump, but the problem is, you ban bump stocks, next it's something else, and then something else,  and then something else...  LIBERALS are little whiney babies who can't stand to not get their way.
619 2018-02-22 21:47:28 I thought bump stocks were being seen to after the mass shooting in Las Vegas or was it Pulse or was it Sandy Hook or Columbine or.... #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
620 2018-02-22 21:47:18 The top five stocks that fell today were $SRCL, $APA, $SNPS, $BHF, and $LKQ.
621 2018-02-22 21:47:13 You gotta give credit where credit is due, Trump is going against NRA by raising the age to legally purchase a firearm from 18 to 21, he’s supports for stronger background checks (again going against the NRA), and has already banned bump stocks across the nation
622 2018-02-22 21:47:05 Dear @Snapchat over 1 million people retweeted a fake tweet and sign a petition. Creators and people on your discover page are losing snap veiws and @KylieJenner ruined your stocks in one tweet. Open your eyes and just change the design back.
623 2018-02-22 21:46:56 I was present at the event. Just prior to the statement in her video Dr. Ross did in fact say she opposed banning bump stocks. My mouth was agape. It took her a bit to connect that to her overarching point. There’s validity to what both candidates said here.
624 2018-02-22 21:46:44 I think this is a great idea, we need to have better background checks and fix the mental health problems. Moving the age from 18 to 21 is fine with me, just don't ban any of them. The bump stocks are fine, we don't need them and can do away with them. #MakeAmericaSafeAgain #USA
625 2018-02-22 21:46:41 YOU HOPE?  Just a little advise you do not need bump stocks to make these AR15  type weapons fire like an automatic weapon. It's just a simple technique called bump fire, So although banning bump stocks is a good thing they are not required to fire at a rapid fire rate.
626 2018-02-22 21:46:36 Sounds like a sure fire reason to sell stocks now - Good luck raising the deficit even further when you need the money to help America. Oh yeah - you elected a Debtor in Chief that is the King of Debt and of course default and bankruptcies - Sorry WORLD - Its America First Time!
627 2018-02-22 21:46:25 I'm a little curious why you think that statement implies ignorance. I'd put myself in the top five percent or so on gun knowledge and I'm firmly in the "ban (at the very lest, any magazine-fed) semi-automatic weapons" camp. But so far we can't even ban bump stocks.
628 2018-02-22 21:46:08 Like the ban bump stocks. Sometimes you got to do what ya got to do but not really mean it?
629 2018-02-22 21:45:38 Right so background checks on ALL sales, ban all high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and rifles that can shoot as fast as an AR-15 and no catch up is necessary.
630 2018-02-22 21:45:28 She never told anyone to sell their stocks, so you’re laughing at nobody.  
631 2018-02-22 21:44:56 I was talking small minor concessions here. Are you going to tell me Bump Stocks invade your 2nd amendment rights too. Dam ppl use some dam logic
632 2018-02-22 21:44:38 I’ll riddle you the Vegas massacre (Bump Stocks) and Aurora and Parkland (age restriction). It’s not like when your older friend is willing to go buy you a case of beer as a minor. I would like to go further than only age and enhancement bans but that’s called middle ground.
633 2018-02-22 21:44:12 Bruh Snapchats stocks went down cause of Kylie Jenner  She’s so lit
634 2018-02-22 21:44:06 It’s insane to ask a teacher to be armed in school! What is needed are stricter federal gun laws and a federal data base. The 2nd amendment was written 227 yrs ago,and I’m damn sure our forefathers couldn’t imagine an AR15 or bump stocks existing when they wrote it!
635 2018-02-22 21:43:39 Checking mental health/criminal background and outright banning bump stocks is definitely a step in the right direction.
636 2018-02-22 21:43:35 Vehemently disagree about bump stocks. Realize this is probably a negotiation strategy. I believe voting age should be increased.
637 2018-02-22 21:43:08 Thank you, bump stocks are not needed, and 21 is a fair age to buy a gun. You can't legally drink until 21!

641 2018-02-22 21:41:19 Agreed, but he also would have had a tough time killing so many with out his AR-15 rifles converted into assault weapons with bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.  He would have had to carry ten times the fire power with regular guns.
642 2018-02-22 21:40:54 Empty promises - an old guy shot up a concert using bump stocks and set a new record for dead Americans shot during a mass shooting, that was the time to deal with bump stocks. You will do nothing, they will do nothing and nothing will change. Aftermath Bullshit - @MichaelMyth
643 2018-02-22 21:40:49 Shorting one of the strongest stocks?
644 2018-02-22 21:40:47 People are upset with the NRA, not law-abiding gun owners. When bump stocks, armor piercing bullets are fought for, there’s a problem. I grew up around guns & understand the utility for 99% of people.
645 2018-02-22 21:40:42 I trade stocks, and US housing is going down, and market's at highs, we could get crash, so too much pressure on our housing industry will wipe out our economy. CAREFUL ON TRYING TO SLOW HOUSING PRICE IN BC!!  NDP would be finished then carefull!!!
646 2018-02-22 21:40:40 Such as? The founding fathers also created the second amendment when you had single load muskets, I don't think they had AR-15's with bump stocks in mind tbh
647 2018-02-22 21:40:36 Remember we closed a bunch then we got the homeless problem
648 2018-02-22 21:40:23 And the lord said to the people "go forth, shoot or be shot, bathe in the blood of your enemies, protecteth what is thine by stockpiling semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines"
649 2018-02-22 21:40:05 A thread: I agree with Trump getting rid of bump stocks for high powered rifles.
650 2018-02-22 21:39:56 #WayneLaPierre WRONG!  We do not hate the 2A or gun owners. We do not want to see the 2A trampled. Citizens do not NEED Assault Weapons or bump stocks. If you're not part of the change, you're part of the problem. #neveragainmovement

651 2018-02-22 21:39:52 Would you say that it... bumped stocks?
652 2018-02-22 21:39:40 throwing crumbs of bump stocks and raising age to 21....dont fall for it
653 2018-02-22 21:39:31 Sure banning bump stocks may seem like a great idea but lets be truthful and not say we’re doing so as a prevention measure let’s just be honest and say we can’t stop wanting to control other people

656 2018-02-22 21:39:04 If we as Conservatives  are not willing to  compromise then you, not me, are as bad as the  left. No argument can be  made for bump stocks, not one. If you have a  semi auto platform and are  proficient with that weapon then the  difference is negligible.Grow up!

661 2018-02-22 21:38:02 Whacko #DanaLoesch claims that the NRA is trying to do something about things like bump stocks, when in reality they are putting pressure on members of Congress to do nothing.
662 2018-02-22 21:37:52 @DLoesch Sir. Two questions from a semi-ignorant English person watching from afar. 1. What does the R stand for in NRA? - why not support banning bump-stocks as fundamentally a R is a R without one. 1/2 #CPAC18 #CPAC2018 #nra
663 2018-02-22 21:37:51 Eff off and get real Donny. I note calibre 22 seems particularly popular. Background checks / mental health / age 21 / ending bump stocks will of course end all these Sandy Hook problems 
664 2018-02-22 21:37:47 You need to read the intent and history behind the 2nd Amend.  Its primary intent is to allow the people to protect themselves from the gov.  Now you support violating the 2nd Amndmnt!? Banning bump stocks goes against the people right to protect themselves.
665 2018-02-22 21:37:47 I trade stocks, and US housing is going down, and market's at highs, we could get crash, so too much pressure on our housing industry will wipe out our economy. CAREFUL ON TRYING TO SLOW HOUSING PRICE IN BC!!

669 2018-02-22 21:36:15 I was going to buy some because at $16 that’s a steal, but with their bad press, new design that is failing I don’t really see a rally anytime soon. Looking at all my stocks they are all majority the red smh 
670 2018-02-22 21:36:02 Highly recommend Amchoor though - our old local Stokey Shop stocks packets of it
671 2018-02-22 21:35:49 So much for the attacks against the 2nd amendment ending. Passing a law against guns is not going to stop this at all, See statistics? Bump stocks are laughable. You can do the same thing with a belt loop. Stop putting these horrible people on all over the news for copy cats.
672 2018-02-22 21:35:47 Just a suggestion stop buying politicians and allow the CDC to do a full study on gun violence. Just a suggestion push laws against things like bump stocks that have zero use except to create mass casualties.

674 2018-02-22 21:35:35 q la Kyle ha hecho que Snapchat pierda stocks amazing
675 2018-02-22 21:35:34 The logic behind breadth analysis is deceptively simple: if an expanding # of stocks are hitting new highs, the odds of b/o following through increase. if the # contracts, the odds are reduced. Ditto for short side.
676 2018-02-22 21:35:08 “Accidents” is key in your tweet... people going and shooting up schools, theaters, concerts, and etc are not “accidents” so you have to make it harder for people to gain these assault rifles, bump stocks and etc.
677 2018-02-22 21:34:58 Forget more guns in schools. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks,  multi-bullet magazines, raise age to 21 at least to purchase/own all weapons, strengthen background checks, close loophole for gun sales at gun shows w/o background checks, increase waiting period to 30 days,
678 2018-02-22 21:34:50 You don't need a bump stock to bump fire, at all.  If you don't believe me, look it up on YouTube.  Potential school shooter:  shit, they banned bump stocks?  Welp, looks like my plans were foiled by this new law.
679 2018-02-22 21:34:21 You can ban bump stocks when you repeal the NFA
680 2018-02-22 21:34:05 Happy birthday @em_stocks!! Hope you’ve had the best day  xx
681 2018-02-22 21:33:59 Outlaw AR-15s and similar weapons. No bump stocks, no high capacity magazines, no suppressors. No cross state cc.  Gun license is qualified and regulated. Gun violence is studied by CDC on factual evidence. Recommendations are made public.
682 2018-02-22 21:33:35 Well if the president can use the pen to create DACA out of thin air, Trump should be able to use the PIN to eliminate bump stocks.
683 2018-02-22 21:33:32 I don't see how solely regulating bump stocks solves this problem.
684 2018-02-22 21:33:18 Your Jesus hates bump stocks, and schrlumpf.
685 2018-02-22 21:33:04 I clearly know more than you if you actually think an AR-15 a “battlefield weapon”. The ones used in war are heavily modified to the point they’re entirely different guns. Bump stocks are what turn them into assault rifles. Your argument is ridiculous.
686 2018-02-22 21:32:59 Mass Shootings Involve Semi Automatic Weapons, Ammunition, Bump Stocks! Stop Blaming and Admiring Yourself On the News! You Are the Problem Not the Solution!
687 2018-02-22 21:32:55 Isn’t the ban on bump stocks an infringement on the #2A ? No need to alter gun laws. Stick to punishing the lawbreaker according to criminal laws - and do it swiftly, so simpletons (fools) won’t seek to emulate him! It’s URGENT!
688 2018-02-22 21:32:44 Bump stocks I understand; unless you really don’t want that buck to run off and suffer. But both NRA and POTUS have called for them to be evaluated.
689 2018-02-22 21:32:40 No one really cares about bump stocks, but if you legislate the components of a gun out of existence it ceases to be. If you ban bump stocks you open up the door to magazine restrictions, heavier triggers, etc.
690 2018-02-22 21:32:35 AJA day. Pls don’t ask about our stocks, sir. Thanks 
691 2018-02-22 21:32:21 Honestly don't disagree with banning bump stocks. My problem is that every1 is yet again having the wrong convo. Instead of figuring out the why, political games are being played & the why is being ignored. Tired of the murder problem. I want the why to be addressed for a change.
692 2018-02-22 21:32:17 Had I better get in stocks of @FUDGEHAIR shaper in case of #ToryHardBrexit ? #RemainandReform
693 2018-02-22 21:32:10 I agree... i have been searching for perfect strategy and changing my set up every time i had bad day. I tried futures, small cap stocks as well as large but cant find my place. My journal has not been updated regularly so no wonder i am making same mistakes over and over.
694 2018-02-22 21:31:52 So if bump stocks get banned, can we then ban abortions?!?
695 2018-02-22 21:31:51 Agree with 21+ age, end bump stocks. Also close gun show & private sale background check loopholes, keep terrorists from getting guns (no fly/no buy list), coordinate school info/police events with FBI no buy lists. Renew @SenFeinstein 's AW gun law that sunseted. #NeverAgain
696 2018-02-22 21:31:23 We are in the tweet you just commented under Donald Trump stated that he is signing a bill to ban bump stocks and create better background checks
697 2018-02-22 21:31:11 you never heard of bump stocks untel las vegas
698 2018-02-22 21:30:59 ARA #gasoline stocks rose by ~4.7% percent to a 19-month high, data from Dutch consultancy #PJK International showed on Thursday.
699 2018-02-22 21:30:39 So,
to protect our children,
we need to ban all assault weapons &
high capacity magazines.

Also
do thorough background checks on all sales,
including gun show & private individual sales.

Also
keep our databases up-to-date.

Also
outlaw Bump stocks

& provide mental health svces
700 2018-02-22 21:30:38 Before you illegally make bump stocks illegal and tell 18-20 year old adults their constitutional rights will be violated, why don't you make it illegal to get an abortion until age 21 and ban the real insruments of war ussd to kill defenseless human beings. Really #MAGA.
701 2018-02-22 21:30:35 anyone can make home made bump stocks, it is not hard to do, if they do take the AR 15's away, then the automatics will be next, I will not lay my guns down for anyone
702 2018-02-22 21:30:34 My Fellow Americans, we have to stay laser focused. Don't let talks of a rogue @FBI leadership, bump stocks, or arming teachers deter or soften your resolve. #NRABloodMoney #Parkland #GunReformNow #Vote4Change
703 2018-02-22 21:30:26 Risk parity is not “smart beta” in that it doesn’t explicitly seek to harvest alternative premia (like value, quality, momentum), but rather expresses the view that diversified asset classes (stocks, bonds, inflation assets) should have similar long-term Sharpe ratios.
704 2018-02-22 21:30:19 but nobody needs bump stocks either. unfortunately they are easy to manufacture and could be 3d printed if banned.
705 2018-02-22 21:30:18 Glad you are recovering well thanks to them. You should ask them if your NRA Party (formerly Republican Party) should BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
706 2018-02-22 21:30:05 I'm not a bureaucrat, a legislator or an attorney, but one thing I know is that banning assault weapons and bump stocks from public purchase will prevent an escalating rise in US mass murder. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
707 2018-02-22 21:29:55 I wanted to buy some stocks. Then I realized we’re poor. 
#poprobs
708 2018-02-22 21:29:48 Marine biologists determined maximum quotas. All fishing communities in the EU have had to downsize. It has saved our cod stocks. You think fish swim in the sea as manna from Heaven?
709 2018-02-22 21:29:47 That said, I think you should be able to own a weapon for hunting or for home protection. You do not NEED large mags, bump stocks, nor immediate access to the gun for the above two.
710 2018-02-22 21:29:26 That said, AR-15s are incredibly modular and can be chambered for anything from .223 to .45 ACP rounds. So couple that wild range (and various grain counts per round) with modular stocks and that's a lot of nobs. I've seen a lot of deer put down with single .223 rounds, at range.
711 2018-02-22 21:29:17 Dear Mr. @POTUS I could care less about "Bump Stocks" Toy. I am concerned about raising the age to 21 for the College age Girls not being able to Conceal Carry for protection.
712 2018-02-22 21:29:12 Here's what we want assault rifle ban, 14 day waiting period, no sales by private owners, 7-round magazine limit, no bump stocks, licenses for all arms, minimum age to purchase 21, Universal background checks, domestic violence band. Stand up for what is right.
713 2018-02-22 21:29:03 You're wrong. Did you not hear the rate of fire in the Las Vegas shooting? I'm sure you can find video on YouTube. I was certain the shooter had full auto capable weapons. That's the day I first learned of bump stocks. With semi auto, fast fingers can do as much damage.
714 2018-02-22 21:27:19 This debacle came about under the @GovernorDavis regime by perpetuating the myth that the 1990s bull market in stocks will continue in perpetuity. Our beloved politicians went along with that scam at the behest of the unions & here we are.
715 2018-02-22 21:27:14 So then he walks down the street to the movie theater? Problem not solved. Problem just moved. Solving the problems requires more intelligence, better background checks, smaller magazines, eliminating things like bump stocks. Must be done legislatively. #WeCallBS #WeakIdea
716 2018-02-22 21:27:10 Interesting to see stable/lower dollar not help stocks. Can’t wait for next weeeeeeek
717 2018-02-22 21:27:07 Who are you to say what is moral? Abortions are not illegal and killing kids in schools with or without bump stocks is illegal. We should all be working to reduce our children being murdered in school - even at the cost of banning bump stocks.
718 2018-02-22 21:27:06 @CNBC kudlow gave jarred all the statistics on how many people own stocks in 401’s etc and the liberal is still concerned abt buy backs. That money belongs to the companies and they can do what they want with it. Bonus’ and wages also being given!
719 2018-02-22 21:26:57 $SPY  Yes it's possible to be overall bearish on the market and still bullish on individual stocks. Example $PI
720 2018-02-22 21:26:54 I literally casually paid myself 8K dollars two months ago with da bitcoins. gold and stocks are useless too. you can't go to taco bell and buy tacos with gold or your stocks. There is literally nothing different between crypto and stock trading. other than gamers being angry
721 2018-02-22 21:26:34 NO. I am voting for a common sense gun control, taking guns away from some people base on mental illness & criminal history. Mandating background checks, banning assault weapons and bomp stocks. I support the 2nd amendments. You should be worried about what is going on,don’t you?
722 2018-02-22 21:25:59 @jaketapper Bump stocks have got to go. Please stop saying they convert from semi auto to auto. They don’t. Do increase the rate of fire but still one round per pull.
723 2018-02-22 21:25:37 Omg! All these #TalkingHeads on @FoxNews who don't even know what an #AR15, magazine, clip are want to raise age to buy rifle to 21 and ban Bump stocks THINKING that will END nut job sickos from murdering others!!! It's NOT the spoon that makes you FAT!!!
724 2018-02-22 21:25:34 Would anyone care to make a bet on whether or not anything actually gets done -Remember when the NRA said they were looking into and gave initial support for bans on bump stocks after Las Vegas?
725 2018-02-22 21:25:19 You people asking for gun reform are so full of shit! Bump fire stocks where used in 1 major crime and you want them erased from history, 99% of these mass shooters where over the age of 21 but you want punish hundreds of thousands of 18 YO AR owners that are 100% innocent.
726 2018-02-22 21:25:18 tiddy stocks and bonds
727 2018-02-22 21:25:00 Abortions are legal and therefore not murder. Where bump stocks are actively used in actual murders at times.
728 2018-02-22 21:24:59 @BoutilliersBrew see you tomorrow night. Looking forward to plundering your bottle stocks...
729 2018-02-22 21:24:43 ...report to state if ok mentally, NRA: ban semi weapons, bump stocks (dont need to be in the community), provide licensing to own a weapon, training, written test, mental test, pay a yearly fee as long as you own a gun/weapon, title and tag each weapon. 2/2
730 2018-02-22 21:24:35 He does realize the bump stocks were not involved in this last shooting?  Or can we expect him to be a shooting behind on all his decisions?
731 2018-02-22 21:24:32 Exactly the same thing happened a while ago with tobacco stocks when new harder regulatory framework passed in USA, they were up even intraday, let alone in the long run
732 2018-02-22 21:24:27 You're thinking with a scarcity mindset (afraid of losing bump stocks) as opposed to an abundance mindset (being greedy for national reciprocity or HPA). Nothing wrong with that. Just remember: were it not for FOPA, your ammo would be registered, Hughes Amendment aside.
733 2018-02-22 21:24:25 Banning bump stocks is a a joke and accomplishes zero.  Adding a bump stock decreases accuracy.  Also banning them won’t stop a person wanting to make one who doesn’t care about the law
734 2018-02-22 21:24:07 I agree. Also, he's being disingenuous. Bump stocks let you brace the gun against your shoulder, vastly improving accuracy. Shooting from the hip is inaccurate (hence the metaphor!) Sure he's shooting rapidly, but bump stocks still make guns more deadly via accuracy.
735 2018-02-22 21:23:53 I have a question....why was the "Vegas" shooter allowed to buy an unlimited amount of assault rifles and bump stocks and there was, supposedly, no signs of mental illness in his life? #BanAssaultWeapons
736 2018-02-22 21:23:49 100%. Higher institutional ownership stocks always tend to fuck with me a bit more as well.
737 2018-02-22 21:23:33 'the violent tug of war between bonds and stocks'
738 2018-02-22 21:23:18 HOAX FAKE NEWS - weaker SOFT data... FEAR PORN from marketwatch

THIS IS THE GREATEST RECOVERY OF ALL TIME - trust ANY central bwanksters... HAVE MarketWatch NOT GOT AN INTERVIEW with one of them...??

Print some more money, buy some negative yield bonds & buy back some STOCKS!!!
739 2018-02-22 21:23:15 I can support better background checks, elimination of bump stocks and raising the purchasing age to 21 (so long as heirlooms can still transfer under 21yrs of age). Also support marshal-style protection at schools rather than in your face armed guards. This is common sense.
740 2018-02-22 21:23:07 She can move stocks very well...
741 2018-02-22 21:22:51 We want a ban on all semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks. Countries that have done have subsequently had few if any, mass murders. #GunControlNow
742 2018-02-22 21:22:49 Personally I think assault weapons, bump stocks shouldn’t b sold period.  Mental health ++ funding. If not guns then some type of added defense n schools, many more things.  Not one easy simple solution unfortunately. What do u think will work?
743 2018-02-22 21:22:37 Watch over 2.5+ looks great chartwise. Question is if the numbers are real or chinese trash company.
744 2018-02-22 21:22:34 Memo to DOJ abt banning bump stocks was STUNT. ATF already told Trump that couldn't be done under current law
745 2018-02-22 21:22:28 Such a POS. Any of the safety gun measures that was in any way touched by Pres Obama were all removed. Didn't matter if good for the country, @realDonaldTrump, or not. Bump stocks aren't guns, ban this and the AR15.
746 2018-02-22 21:22:17 I like the 21, we need national gun registry. I'm completely for the 2nd amendment, I don't think a national reg. takes rights away from legal gun owners. I don't know enough about bump stocks.
747 2018-02-22 21:22:14 @MCaruso_Cabrera Small investors who invest in index funds or stocks believe a company is worth more if their rev and earnings keep growing.  Our only fear is of financial analysts always looking for the boogyman and our fear they will do something irrational
748 2018-02-22 21:22:06 Totally agree with that! Some research shows that when funds get new inflows they tend not to diversify, but rather, to buy stocks they already own (I don’t have the cite offhand) 1/
749 2018-02-22 21:22:01 Agree, but he used bump stocks.
750 2018-02-22 21:21:42 Leave bump stocks alone. Give us the right to bear military grade weapons as we are fearing an attack on us by a leftist government!!!
751 2018-02-22 21:21:39 They came up with the 2nd amendment to overthrow the government of that time, if need be, allowing civilians to protect themselves. No one needs an AR-15, let alone bump stocks.
752 2018-02-22 21:21:26 Wait so now you want to ban my Call Of Duty video game but real automatic guns are still ok?!?! Yes that will save the kids you idiot...middle America deserves you because yes my stocks are up and I am making $$ but the people who voted for you arent!!!!
753 2018-02-22 21:21:25 Want to influence gun makers.  SELL THE STOCKS. DONT INVEST IN FUNDS THAT OWN GUN COMPANIES.  BOYCOTT GUN STOCKS.   CRUSH EM
754 2018-02-22 21:21:14 Ban bump stocks, mandatory wait periods, complete background checks on every transfer, licencing, registration, insurance, ban AR-15, no guns if on no fly list, found mentally unstable, charges of domes violence  ... So many changes would reduce risk
755 2018-02-22 21:21:13 Let me tell you how it’s going to go, from reading history - they’re going to start with something innocuous - bump stocks. Ok you acquiesced on bump stocks, why not ban standard cap magazines? Ok you acquiesced on mags, well nobody needs an AR pattern rifle. Boiling frogs.
756 2018-02-22 21:21:05 Dude all these stocks we trade are pumped in some shape way and form. This stock market game is SO DIRTY and cut throat and the people that are actual “friends” in this game are the ones that are on the same side of the trade hate to say it
757 2018-02-22 21:20:55 If it pulls out of both stocks and cryptos, where is it going? Commodities? Or are they tanking too?

759 2018-02-22 21:20:05 @pete lee Because members don't get any say-so in what they do? They are a lobbyist organization for the gun manufacturers.  They've never found a single gun regulation to be acceptable.  They even backtracked on the bump stocks after saying they were for looking at banning them.
760 2018-02-22 21:19:24 @realDonaldTrump @waynelapierrejr It's NOT about the being 'great' people, it is about protecting our #ParklandStudentsSpeak. It is about YOU and the Legislation #EndGunViolence #GunReform by banning Military weapons, bump stocks and instituting through National Background checks
761 2018-02-22 21:19:14 That's why I support trump and the nra wanting to ban bumb stocks, or any modification that turns these guns into illegal, automatic ones. Bc automatic guns have been illegal to the public since 1986
762 2018-02-22 21:19:13 It's not the guns or the bump stocks the reasons guns end up in the wrong hands that need to be addressed. Better background checks might help but better education about guns and gun safety may help better

The major US stock indices are ending the day mixed.
766 2018-02-22 21:18:14 Wilshere s call for more gun regulation boosts firearm stocks
767 2018-02-22 21:18:01 Not THIS again. The constitutions talk about arms in the context of "a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State." That doesn't mean that Thomas Jefferson wanted easy access to bumps stocks.
768 2018-02-22 21:17:57 That's a challenging one, with stocks in general. It's rare to get sell recommendations. In most instances fintwit prefer to cite "expensive" PE but they don't put it bluntly that one should sell. But traders will give you a reason to sell based on price action.

771 2018-02-22 21:16:37 This is what you can do to deliver: BAN assault guns, BAN bump stocks, stricter background checks.
772 2018-02-22 21:16:30 However, others argue that big funds trade more liquid stocks which makes the price impact per share smaller 5/

774 2018-02-22 21:16:09 They can't neither can the DOJ. Congress is the only one that can make it law to ban assault rifles and bump stocks. They enforce the law only.
775 2018-02-22 21:16:05 You are fucked if you say bump stocks need to be legal.
776 2018-02-22 21:15:54 Snap stocks were never worth it in the first place
777 2018-02-22 21:14:39 If you support bans on things, things like bump stocks, and raising the age for long guns, what difference does one or two falsehoods here or there make? You are trying to treat symptoms so who cares if you say ban this or that? You are not standing firm, so walk away.
778 2018-02-22 21:14:24 This lady in front bathroom is yelling at her S/O on the phone because one of their stocks went down. I’m just trying to shit in peace I don’t need this.
779 2018-02-22 21:14:03 Stocks end slightly higher; Dow and S&P snap two-day skid
780 2018-02-22 21:14:01 Bump stocks are stupid and NICS can be a useful tool. But AR bans won't fix anything.
781 2018-02-22 21:13:50 Anna I respect your opinion but your logic is flawed. There is no constitutional right to bump stocks. Also blaming the FBI for every mass shooting is false, do you know how many tips they receive? FBI does not have unlimited resources. FBI are the good guys stop attacking them!
782 2018-02-22 21:13:28 This is exactly what I wanted to hear. Sold a lot of stocks today, but bought more CANN at 0.53 (missed the EOD dip).
783 2018-02-22 21:13:23 Lets not kid ourselves what Bump Stocks do. They allow you to kill with a higher rate of fire, end of story.  Finger firing hurts both accuracy and ROF.
784 2018-02-22 21:13:16 People who think that bump stocks make rifles automatic have absolutely no idea what they're are talking about
785 2018-02-22 21:13:12 A gerbera daisy, a lavender, and a amaranth went into a bar. The bartender says why the stocks?
786 2018-02-22 21:13:12 Simple solutions such as... must be 21 to purchase a gun, 30 day waiting periods on all gun transactions, no bump stocks, proper training, pass background checks. Celebrity bodyguards carry guns... my family is just as important and so is your family.
787 2018-02-22 21:13:12 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
788 2018-02-22 21:12:59 Bump fuzzies, not stocks!
#GunControlNow
789 2018-02-22 21:12:59 Trump just announced a ban of bump stocks and is pushing legislation to raise minimum age for gun purchases to 21 and for stricter background checks w/ emphasis on mental health. Sounds to me like does "got this". What did these losers ever do? Absolutely nothing.
790 2018-02-22 21:12:51 Ban assault weapons NOW!  What's the hold up on banning bump stocks?
791 2018-02-22 21:12:24 "Bump stocks" aren't part of the 2nd Amendment.
792 2018-02-22 21:12:23 I invested in some s&p 500 stocks the other day they are a little down right now but patience is the key. My next stock purchase will be Fitbit
793 2018-02-22 21:12:20 What you're really trying to do is drive up sale of bump stocks by placing fear of a ban - but not do anything in the end. Nice move. Classic KGB reverse psychology move.
794 2018-02-22 21:12:06 #US stocks end mixed as bonds gain!
795 2018-02-22 21:11:59 To Ban bump stocks will solve nothing. This is just a concession to ban something without giving up Assault rifles. It will satisfy some people that want something banned. It is better than giving up your Assault guns, but accomplishes nothing. I feel for responsible owners.
796 2018-02-22 21:11:45 Trump the Deal-maker: We'll ban bump stocks if you drop the Russian investigation.
797 2018-02-22 21:11:36 I don't think we should be completely banning Bump Stocks or even Fully Automatic Weapons (which we already unfortunately ban). I agree with making sure they only end up in the hands of Great and Very Responsible American patriots. Go with the stronger background checks!
798 2018-02-22 21:11:20 Robert, lives on Laguna Canyon with lots of dogs.

Put all their savings into pickle stocks. Can't retire.
799 2018-02-22 21:11:06 Actually, bump stocks are not your right. The ownership of the gun is. Accessories/modifications to guns are legal (and not even all of them are) but not protected by the constitution. Just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should. Why do you think sawed offs are illegal?
800 2018-02-22 21:11:04 Electric trains don’t have bump stocks
801 2018-02-22 21:10:44 Assault rifles are basically illegal.  What you are confusing for assault rifles are semi auto rifles not the same thing ar15s are not assault rifles.  Hi cap mags are a no as well changes nothing.  Bump stocks sure ban them.
802 2018-02-22 21:10:40 Les mecs comme moi qui sont pas stocks je nous comprends pas wsh on est 2018 y a des gars musclés riches intelligents et drôles et nous on est la on a même pas une des 4 qualités c'est quoi notre problème ?
803 2018-02-22 21:09:37 US stocks closed modestly higher on the day: $DJIA +165, $SPX +3
804 2018-02-22 21:09:30 It would be interesting if the issue of assault weapons, weapon registration, bump stocks, and an assortment of other hot button gun issues could be decided by voters in local and state elections instead of relying on our congress.
805 2018-02-22 21:09:14 "Well-regulated militia" does not mean a regular Joe should start his own militia incorporating bum stocks.
806 2018-02-22 21:09:14 Stocks and gambling lines.    Give me your worst!!!!
807 2018-02-22 21:09:14 US stocks closed higher on the day: $DJIA +165, $SPX +3
808 2018-02-22 21:09:08 No new gun laws. Bump stocks are irrelevant.
809 2018-02-22 21:08:54 The Parkland shooter used the method of multiple magazines to shoot as many rounds as possible. The Nevada shooter modified by bump stocks.
810 2018-02-22 21:08:51 The pram I want desperately is on sale while stocks last and me and jack both are skint. So Chloe is ordering it for me tomorrow  she literally is the best
811 2018-02-22 21:08:40 I relish the day the sun will be beaming on me during my time in the garden! Indoor cultivation has hit its peak. All stocks are speculative and people are filled with scarcity rather than logic. Unfortunately  is well know for subsidizing outdated business plans
812 2018-02-22 21:08:17 How about re-enacting the assault weapons ban, limiting clip sizes, banning bump stocks and increasing mental health counselors at schools?
No one wants to eliminate conceal and carry or hunting.
Let's compromise for kids safety!
813 2018-02-22 21:08:08 Hmm, do you see hype men like @DiaryofaMadeMan shilling stocks & IPO's in the stock market?

814 2018-02-22 21:08:05 Help to insure that these students, all other students, & the entire US have a better chance at "opportunities" by BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS. Your NRA Party  eroded laws that were in place that would have prevented or diminished recent mass shootings.
815 2018-02-22 21:08:00 Fido Dido Debates Bump Stocks
816 2018-02-22 21:07:55 Outlawing bump stocks will do nothing but drive it underground, think drugs. Take them off the market someone will make them in their garage. What criminal is going to care about a signed piece of paper, already have one that says dont murder?
817 2018-02-22 21:07:35 Book of Bump Stocks verse 2017-18
818 2018-02-22 21:07:33 How about standing up for the rights of peaceful, and unarmed, citizens and children  by removing the assault weapons and bump stocks.  Guns kill people, and rapid fire guns kill more people!
819 2018-02-22 21:07:30 the #NRA gave me $30 Million Dollars so obviously  they are nice people the #NRABloodMoney pays congress to continue to look the other way as more of our citizens get slaughtered! Bump Stocks, Backround Check, And A #AssaultWeaponsBan small measures that won't pass Bc of NRA $$
820 2018-02-22 21:07:25 Not controversial - Raise the price of bump stocks to several thousand dollars!
821 2018-02-22 21:07:22 .@GovGaryJohnson Do you support a ban on bump stocks and/or raising the age to 21 to buy semiautomatic rifles?
822 2018-02-22 21:07:17 Congress has to ban the bump stocks, you know this. You signed a bill on Feb. 28th, 2017 allowing mentally ill to buy guns reversing a law. Why did you do this? Congress passed that law allowing mentally ill to buy guns. @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr why?
823 2018-02-22 21:06:57 None but remember the concert that was because of bump stocks

825 2018-02-22 21:06:52 I'm not a Democrat or a Republican either. But this is America not Australia or Canada or England. None of those countries have a 2nd Amendment, or a Bill of Rights. I'm all for better background checks, getting rid of bump stocks and raising the aged to purchase any gun.
826 2018-02-22 21:06:52 Well looks like the President was listening ban on bump stocks, looking to do more thorough background check and address buying guns with mental illness
827 2018-02-22 21:06:51 What a lie because all of your actions are the opposite of what is coming out of your mouth. You removed mental health position of Obama and You did nothing about bump stocks. None of your policies have anything to do with keeping kids safe
828 2018-02-22 21:06:49 Bump stocks were so Las Vegas... Slow!!! @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
829 2018-02-22 21:06:43 Oh, so wrong. Bump stocks cause murder. And our laws do not say that abortion is Murder - that is an opinion by a sub-set of the population. If you care about Life, why defend a bump stock which is a retro-fit intended for killing? makes no sense.
830 2018-02-22 21:06:21 Longer waiting period-2 weeks, thorough background check, mental health check-which Trump rolled back, no gun if felony or DV charge, close the boyfriend loophole, limit amount of guns and ammo a person can have, register the gun, no private sales, no bump stocks
831 2018-02-22 21:06:03 You know what’s frightening @RajShah45 ? assault weapons in the hands of civilians, bump stocks, huge magazines, the @nra and the sexual predator and white supremist in the WH.
832 2018-02-22 21:05:34 You have raised a wonderful son but am also horrified that this is our nation. Assault rifles need to go along with better mental health services, stricter gun checks, and no bump stocks.
833 2018-02-22 21:05:31 Raising the age to 21 in all states? Good. Banning bump stocks? Nah, too many exist and it's possible to make your own easily or with a good ol' stiff arm. Best thing you could do would be to ban future sales... RIP SlideFire
834 2018-02-22 21:05:27 @NRA Bump stocks should be classified as class III devices.  This would partially mitigate the 1986 giveaway of full autos in that years gun legislation.
835 2018-02-22 21:05:03 It would save the next child from being struck is the point. AR-15s and bump stocks should have stayed banned. There is no good reason for a civilian to own one.
836 2018-02-22 21:04:45 We/they want a ban on AR14/15s, bump stocks & u went into some speal about there's like 20 type semi automatics they said atleast it's a start this was before you acted dumb about size of magazines. Glad you showed up but you have been acting like a mini Trump...
837 2018-02-22 21:04:41 Why are kids being paid to talk about bump stocks at the Town Hall meeting when this had nothing to do with the Shooting they experienced?
838 2018-02-22 21:04:33 Yes saving lives is a bad agenda eh. Bump stocks won't stop kids being slaughtered in schools. But ignore that fact if you wish. Have a great day.
839 2018-02-22 21:04:33 Trump’s “shift” on guns—assuming he sticks with it for more than one news cycle—is not “dramatic” at all. Bump stocks are not popular and it’s not clear he intends to expand background checks to gun shows and private transactions.
840 2018-02-22 21:04:30 Trump must be thrown out of office for not saying that Democrats wanted bump stocks removed for months now, also stricter background checks and assault weapon ban. He lies and lies. He HAS to be mentally challenged. IMPEACH!
841 2018-02-22 21:04:23 When the 2nd amendment was written the fastest firing weapon was the Ferguson rifle...7 rounds per minute.  The AR-15 is five times that at 45...with no assistance.  Bump stocks can double this.  Assault rifles were not the intent of the founding fathers
842 2018-02-22 21:04:15 the president does not support banning bump stocks if he does not support congressional legislation to do so. it’s the very definition of saying one thing and doing another. he’s punting by having his doj “look into it”.
843 2018-02-22 21:04:09 Well bump stocks don't count.   So.  Since you make the rules. I guess that doesn't count as modification
844 2018-02-22 21:03:55 and what, exactly, do you consider "the right thing?" Here's my prediction, the @NRA won't budge an inch on bump stocks, assault weapons, magazine size, background checks, legal purchase age, and guns sales will continue to soar. Prove me wrong you big blowhard.
845 2018-02-22 21:03:52 Anna I thought the same thing until I saw a video on how bump stocks work and I was in awe they shouldn’t be allowed
846 2018-02-22 21:03:44 He’s a ROCK! Bump stocks would’ve been a consensus vote to ban in the senate.  All he needs to do is learn how to show empathy.  Then learn how government works to be a good president.  Instead he acts like a 13 jealous, insecure asshole..
847 2018-02-22 21:03:29 Tell me where the Constitution gives you a right to bear bump stocks.
848 2018-02-22 21:03:15 Yet here we are having this conversation & Trump wants to raise the age limit, ban bump stocks & push background checks. Kids, who can’t vote, are already creating change u were referring to & you (the media) telling kids who want to DO something, they aren’t doing it right? Idk
849 2018-02-22 21:03:05 Percent of Stocks Above 200-Day Average INDEX: 56.05
850 2018-02-22 21:02:57 The Kardashians are so powerful they now crash internet and stocks
851 2018-02-22 21:02:51 correct. I don't care for them either. they harm accuracy.
however, they will take their time. starting with stocks, moving to certain grips, over to scopes and detachable sights. over to magazines and certain types of triggers.
852 2018-02-22 21:02:39 Tom, with ya. 30 stocks. Easy to move a couple and make things look okay. Too easy to "paint the tape."
853 2018-02-22 21:02:32 It ain’t about the damn bump stocks no matter what side your on.
854 2018-02-22 21:02:29 Are Stocks Merely Bouncing to Lower Highs?
855 2018-02-22 21:02:25 $DNR up big and still undervalued imo! $energy $oil $stocks
856 2018-02-22 21:02:05 Anybody who defends the right to buy  assault rifles and bump stocks is an accomplice in all these massacres
857 2018-02-22 21:01:40 Never thought I see the day but somehow @KylieJenner ends up in my wall street closing report - chapeaux Madame! #stocks #kadashians
858 2018-02-22 21:01:35 You still haven’t banned fucking bump stocks that make them rapid fire like machine guns tho.
859 2018-02-22 21:01:12 What’s going on with the gun debate is absurd. Bump stocks ban, arm teachers, change age of purchaser from 18 to 21. These feeble attempts will change nothing but appease very few people. They are settling for this non-solution. The only working solution is BAN ASSAULT RIFLES
860 2018-02-22 21:01:07 It’s only on the table because Republicans just say “nope, we’re not banning bump stocks, assault rifles, backing background checks, gun violence research, or any other helpful policy.” Literally the only thing left is turning schools into a war zone. How did this happen?
861 2018-02-22 21:01:02 Stop banning gun parts and start banning gun free zones. THAT is the KILLING grounds. Bump stocks/age are NOT the problem. Up the age for recruitment to 21. 18 yr olds can't have guns. How many are in the military 18 to 21? Common you are smarter than that.
862 2018-02-22 21:00:24 Bump stocks automatic weapon conversion . In case you are not aware
863 2018-02-22 21:00:18 You didn't answer the question. Bump stocks. What do you use them for? Things that have caused past mass shootings should be eliminated because they aren't needed. You have enough guns for your purposes.
864 2018-02-22 21:00:16 If you own stocks get out!  A crash is coming which they don’t want you to know about!
865 2018-02-22 20:59:58 They do when equipped with bump stocks or other similar crank devices.
866 2018-02-22 20:59:55 $CSX just raised dividend! #stocks #market #investing #dividends #DowJones
867 2018-02-22 20:59:41 Well it appears Trump might be pushing for bump stocks to be outlawed. Closing the loophole in the domestic abuse portion of being prevented from buying a firearm. I actually think dishonorable discharge shouldn't be one by itself if the discharge isn't violent in nature.
868 2018-02-22 20:59:33 “closely regulated” no. they need to be abolished. There is no need for one at all, bump stocks turn these weapons into automatic rifles which are 100% illegal, so why would you “regulate” something that turns a weapon into an illegal weapon. It needs to disappear period.
869 2018-02-22 20:59:25 Tilly Rachal you’re doing amazing sweetie  get rid of those bump stocks!!!
870 2018-02-22 20:59:25 1. Because I pay them.
2. Wrong, there is no 're-deployment' of cash (that's the myth of 'trickle down').
3. Stocks crash. If you're really worried about pensions, you'd argue that it should be nationalized, like in Nordic countries.
Any other questions?
871 2018-02-22 20:59:16 @BillGriffeth why is it going up?  My stocks generally have better ratings, more EPS, lower outstanding shares,more cash and a few have increased dividends. That’s my perspective.
872 2018-02-22 20:58:49 To my mind, that leaves one of TWO ALTERNATIVES:
1) Raise the age to purchase ANY gun to 25 ( giving those who will continue to have difficulty with the law the OPEN RECORD of an adult).
2) Prohibit sales of all military style weapons, large capacity magazines and bump-stocks.
873 2018-02-22 20:58:38 Make Bump Stocks available for purchase by certified gun ranges to be used onsite only.
874 2018-02-22 20:58:30 sc stocks went down 1.3 billion after Kylie tweeted like wow.
875 2018-02-22 20:58:27 Bump stocks aren't your right. They are an after market loophole that turn semi automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons. I'm sure your disposition would be different if you'd been at a certain Las Vegas concert. Get real. Want an automatic weapon? Get the proper license.
876 2018-02-22 20:58:23 *US 2A’ers* Fuck you ordinary citizens, I need my bump stocks & semi auto rifles to protect me if the govt tries to override my liberties, IT’S MY RIGHT. *US Govt* I’ll see your poultry weaponry and raise you stinger missiles, a fully equipped airforce and nuclear armoury  
877 2018-02-22 20:58:13 The huge majority of the school shooters were OVER 21, Professor...Las Vegas was months ago..you're just talking about bump stocks now?....and define Comprehensive?..you signed a bill into law a year ago making it EASIER for the mentally ill to purchase firearms!
878 2018-02-22 20:58:12 Not even assault rifles? Bump stocks? High capacity magazines?

Why does any civilian need military weapons?
879 2018-02-22 20:58:02 Ok just too many curveballs again! Just listen to your stocks. Mine pushed me into a heavy cash position today. All I really need to know. Let others try to predict what the market is going to do next ...a fools game for sure ;-)
880 2018-02-22 20:57:42 The Vegas shooter was 29. The Sutherland Springs shooter was 26. The Virginia Tech shooter was 23. The Pulse shooter was 29. You didn’t want to ban bump stocks after Vegas. Now you do. Parkland was an AR-15- so what has to happen before you want to ban those?!? You wasted time .
881 2018-02-22 20:57:13 If you are pro-choice, you should stand up for the rights of other women to have them, even if you don't want to exercise that right yourself. Which is why I stand up for bump stocks even though I think they're really lame.
882 2018-02-22 20:57:11 The future of stock futures is in Japan CPI hands... a beat will send JP stocks to the floor, US stocks might not like it.
883 2018-02-22 20:57:06 This article you posted is defending bump stocks after your rep on @CNN last night vague implied an intent to support bump stock bans. Let your true colors fly, assholes.
884 2018-02-22 20:57:01 The tax cuts were supposed to  "stimulate the economy" and "help the American worker." Instead, execs buy back stocks...stocks are inflated...Execs own these stocks and get rich(er)...bubble bursts...taxpayers bail corporations out. Repeat.
885 2018-02-22 20:56:53 Explain Vegas. No criminal record. Dozen of Assault Rifles. More than 50 dead. Bump Stocks are still legal. 

The @NRA lobbyists don't care about American lives.
886 2018-02-22 20:56:42 I hope snapchat stocks keep dropping until they listen. Youve already lost a billion, dont think it cant be more
887 2018-02-22 20:56:37 $TYHT some volume now ...on close watch for 2.35s break imo
888 2018-02-22 20:56:29 I don't care about bump stocks, or background checks or mental health, as long as the law is written so that it can not be applied in a wrong way. Also, we should raise the draft age to 21. No one under 21 should be able to join the military, or go to war, it's only logical.
889 2018-02-22 20:56:23 Dude ar-15 and bump stocks are not the problem dude I'm starting to get pissed that I voted for u
890 2018-02-22 20:56:17 So much for shareholder value....every time gun control hits the headlines...gun stocks appreciate.
891 2018-02-22 20:55:55 twitter is losing just like Hillary, however if the AR15 bump stocks are banned then the automatics will be next, soon no one will have guns that there is where Hillary Soros list goes on they win we all end up in the NWO
892 2018-02-22 20:55:48 But this is not the days of muskets. Citizens with AR-15s and bump stocks might be able to defend themselves against other citizens with like weapons, but not the military. That scenario is one out of  Hollywood, designed to scare gullible, fearful people.
893 2018-02-22 20:55:34 Yes. I’m just trying to figure out if utilities and other defensive stocks that typical help in a market dislocation will offer same defense
894 2018-02-22 20:55:03 Yes and they do. How many people would be alive today if the AR-15 and bump stocks were outlawed? Not all. But not all 17 souls would be dead. If you were in a classroom would you have a better chance of attacking and bringing down with a handgun or AR-15
895 2018-02-22 20:55:02 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX signal will not complete today, NDX is borderline right now, could complete at the close.
896 2018-02-22 20:55:01 You're just doing a flurry of nothingness. Ban bump stocks. My mentally ill younger brother can still buy a semi-automatic weapon. He just won't be able to convert it into a fully automatic weapon. You've done nothing and will continue to nothing. Except tweet. And fix your hair.
897 2018-02-22 20:55:00 wonder whats after .11s
898 2018-02-22 20:54:57 I'm all for legislation that limits gun magazine capacities and bans bump stocks. But we need to repeal the 2nd Amendment.
899 2018-02-22 20:54:56 Curious how it looks if you also include a chart of treasury yields (say 10-year) ... stocks rise -> yields climb -> stocks fall -> yields fall
900 2018-02-22 20:54:50 The internet
Movies
Video Games

These are also in the UK, Australia, and other countries across the globe, and they don't have mass shootings.  This is a distraction.  Comprehensive Gun Reform is the answer.  Ban. Assault Weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
901 2018-02-22 20:54:47 Trump, not just ban bump stocks but abolish all deadly rifles would be the answer, you dumpster fire.
902 2018-02-22 20:54:35 Bump stocks are selling "big league"  companies love these little scares. Hardly anyone was buying until there's a threat to ban.
903 2018-02-22 20:54:33 @realDonaldTrump Please reconsider any ban on bump stocks or rate increasing devices. They DO NOT make a semi-auto into an auto. Background checks are important as is mental health issues. Age shouldn’t matter as soldiers are 18 and they also vote, give them right to arms.
904 2018-02-22 20:54:27 I'm really hot on mining stocks at the moment. Keep me in the loop 
905 2018-02-22 20:54:05 petitions going around to ban the AR15 plus bump stocks, do not sign, the petitions are made up by Soros Hillary list goes on the AR15 is not an assault rifle it becomes an assault rifle if you shoot someone anything can be an assault weapon, keys knives pens/pencils list goes on
906 2018-02-22 20:53:41 Stocks Suffer a Volatile Week Despite Strong Earnings
907 2018-02-22 20:53:38 Its so awesome what those stoneman douglas kids are doing. They're demanding lawmakers make changes to gun laws and its working. Marco rubio and even trump finally admitted that high capacity magazines and bump stocks are a problem. Its a very small step in the right direction
908 2018-02-22 20:53:30 Stocks on the move after "dovish" FOMC minutes....

911 2018-02-22 20:53:07 The part where it says "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" is what allows you to have a bump stock. Banning bump stocks would be an infringement.
912 2018-02-22 20:53:03 Ban Assault weapons & Bump Stocks!!!!
913 2018-02-22 20:53:00 CFA is based on marine biologists who say fishermen catch too much fish. They have saved our cod stocks from extinction.

Therefore, there are restrictions & quotas. UK has them too.

If the EU was intent on punishing UK fishermen, why does UK sell part of its quotas to others?
914 2018-02-22 20:52:54 Agreed lets stop using the app, get our pension, and savings funds to stop investing in the company and he will theoretically make less by end of 2020 if the stocks crash hard. This is how we stop the rich from getting richer.
915 2018-02-22 20:52:52 #ParklandStudents don’t accept doublespeak on bump-stocks & background checks. Demand  reinstated banning of assault weapons. We had one.
916 2018-02-22 20:52:49 After Vegas I heard some Rs says bump stocks should be banned. Didn’t happen. How long should that take?  Look at the Rs in Florida. Won’t even talk guns. Rs won’t let anything happen. They love their NRA money.
917 2018-02-22 20:52:44 Age limit raises for purchase rifles (never will gen ban), universal background cks to include mental health and social media, no bp stocks and no high capacity clips.  Why not put bulletproof doors on classrooms?
918 2018-02-22 20:52:35 #NRA #GunControlNow Merchants of Death may be in your 401K. BlackRock and Vanguard are among the biggest managers of exchange traded and index funds, which buy all the stocks in a given index in an effort to reproduce its performance.

920 2018-02-22 20:52:12 do you have kids @Annakhait ? i suspect no with your yearning for bump stocks instead of snuggles
921 2018-02-22 20:52:12 That was the point of my comment. He should not be focusing on age limits or bump stocks at all. Don't assume I didn't already know that.
922 2018-02-22 20:52:05 Don't ruin the right to guns for responsible users. Make it impossible for irresponsible users to get bump stocks, don't drag us into it.
923 2018-02-22 20:52:03 I hope you’re right. But I doubt it. The left has been too consitently predictable; radical.  But riddle me this, how would a ban on bump stocks or higher age req. for purchase have changed the course in the majority of mass shootings we’ve had? Murders don’t follow law/bans.
924 2018-02-22 20:51:31 Left: We want gun control!

Trump: okay, let's ban bump stocks, raise the legal age limit, and tighten background checks

Left: No! We want gun control!
925 2018-02-22 20:51:27 I think he should've shown support of President Trump's proposals for Age Requirements, Background checks and BANNING Bump Stocks!!!
926 2018-02-22 20:51:25 Leave guns alone. The media and left will hate you no matter what you do. Your base will hate you if change the laws against bump stocks and raise the age. People have guns to protect against tyranny and want guns that will be equal to those of a tyrannical regime.
927 2018-02-22 20:51:24 I wrote a nasty tweet comparing dirtbags Wayne LaPierre & Wayne Pacelle which I regret. We must forget LaPierre's fire, Loesch's performance, Rubio's embarrassment & Trump's cue cards. All are tactical distractions. Focus on real action (raising age to 21, ban bump stocks).
928 2018-02-22 20:51:24 Whenever I see Peter Schiff on TV, I think he should be in full clown garb. Besides Gartman and maybe Kass, this guy is the biggest quack out there. Dollar to zero. Gold to a trillion. Stocks and bonds to zero.
929 2018-02-22 20:51:24 A 16-year-old girl: "Do you think it should be harder to obtain semi-automatic rifles, as well as modifications to make them fully automatic such as bump stocks?"

A Professional Spokesperson for the NRA: "Er, uh, well, I mean, *that* guy was totally NUTS, right?"
930 2018-02-22 20:51:08 Bump stocks not the problem, 18 not the problem. SECURITY at schools IS the problem. Rich kids, banks, stores etc have armed security but our kids aren't ..what? Not good enough for it?
931 2018-02-22 20:51:00 Basic target is around sp'2670... which really should be seen tomorrow. Some individual stocks (inc' $MU) suggest 2620/10s next Mon/Tuesday.

yours truly is already thinking ahead to next Wed', when Powell will be speaking to the US house.
932 2018-02-22 20:50:59 Its gross seeing these people talk abt how #guncontrol /bump stocks/military grade weapons aren’t the issue, that people need to relearn the value of human life. Well guess what I VALUE HUMAN LIFE SO MUCH THAT ILL GIVE UP MY “RIGHT” TO OWN AN ASSAULT WEAPON TO SAVE THOUSANDS MORE
933 2018-02-22 20:50:33 Why do we Have Corvettes? Smh Bump Fire Stocks are over rated and the accuracy unless your highly trained is horrible! Educate yourself! It probably saved a lot of lives since the only shooting where they were used was in Vegas.
934 2018-02-22 20:50:32 Peoplekind takes offence to you assaulting my stocks, please refrain from using such vulgar language  - PM,Turdo
935 2018-02-22 20:50:15 @realDonaldTrump No more restrictions. bump stocks are not the problem. Age limit 21 is OK.
936 2018-02-22 20:49:57 imagine being a fan of the Reds, Arsenal, and gas company stocks since 2014
937 2018-02-22 20:49:41 Well ignoring your agresive tone I didn't say fully automatic, either way an AR-15 or another semi can be modified with bump stocks very simply. Point being these are weapons of war not for sport or defending against wild animals which is what the founding fathers intended.
938 2018-02-22 20:49:04 The assault weapons ban did nothing. You're so naive. Worse, you're spreading ignorance. Yes, full auto weapons were restricted in 1936 and still are. Bump stocks do not make the weapon an automatic, therefore no loophole. Please... STOP TALKING!
939 2018-02-22 20:49:03 Security, not gun control is what will help protect our children in school. Bump stocks regulations are @NRA supported, iirc and fine; against raising the age to 21 as then 18-20 year olds living on their own are unable to protect themselves. Audit the FBI. Thank you. #2A
940 2018-02-22 20:49:00 Big issue when you read such legislation, is that it typical reads something along the lines as banning "bump stocks, -or any modification which alters/increases the rate of fire-", such wording could ban common modifications to things such as triggers, gas systems, bolts, ect...
941 2018-02-22 20:48:58 I really do not see a need for bump stocks, which EMULATE (NOT MAKE) automatic guns through the recoil against the shoulder causing the trigger finger to jerk thus firing repeatedly.
942 2018-02-22 20:48:53 No, he wants to bump stocks, to help his friends rake in more profit.
943 2018-02-22 20:48:47 I like the security guard option. Creates jobs but who will pay for the security? Budgets are so tight the way it is now, money would have to come from govt. As a teacher, I don't want a gun. Making bump stocks and other equipment that makes rifle more efficient would help too...
944 2018-02-22 20:48:45 $xbi Just more etf games.  Watch this & the Nasdaq, tick for tick move together with +0.5% offset 2day. Not much to do w/ biotech stocks.

945 2018-02-22 20:48:43 My kid is home schooled and I have 2 ARs with bump stocks and 40 round mags and I would never use them to defend him if we were attacked by a killer. I would just let him get shot. 
946 2018-02-22 20:48:42 Why didn't you act sooner?  Took you months to move on bump stocks.  Took the kids walking out for you to act #loser

952 2018-02-22 20:48:20 Keep bump stocks there fun.....!!!
953 2018-02-22 20:48:10 Assault weapons shouldn't be a thing at all unless in the hands of the military or police. No one should be assaulting anyone. But yes, I do realize he understands bump stocks and wants to ban them.
954 2018-02-22 20:48:04 So in this entire thread we’ve figured out tobacco and cars kill more people each year yet we still have alcohol and tobacco. It’s ILLEGAL for a car to run people over. The car itself didn’t run people over. The person behind the wheel did. Bump stocks are a right and her right.
955 2018-02-22 20:47:47 Donald, if semiautomatic assault weapons, the only purpose of which is to kill PEOPLE, were banned, the issue of bump stocks would be moot. (Look it up or ask someone what “moot” means)
956 2018-02-22 20:47:34 I'm hopeful you are in favor of many:
1) 30 day waiting periods 
2) a unified gun registry
3) increasing age of those eligible to buy guns
4) no bump stocks
5) NO assault weapons
6) mandatory training hours rerquired for all gun owners
7) 30 days for background checks

958 2018-02-22 20:47:14 Ana I’m waiting to hear your praise on Trump breaking with conservatives, listening to those students and taking action.  Raising the age to buy a gun to 21, ending the sale of bump stocks, more comprehensive background checks.  I’m waiting.  Where’s the praise for Trump?
959 2018-02-22 20:46:59 We need to close loopholes in gun shows , people under 18 should not be able to  buy guns, Mental health issues need to be address, bum stocks need to be banned and semi automatic weapons need to be banned!
960 2018-02-22 20:46:51 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks are not the problem. Guns are tools just like any other tool. Do not bend over to the #Democrats and the media just because they are loud. We voted for you when they kept saying you don't have a chance. A huge part of your base is not happy now. #2A
961 2018-02-22 20:46:41 Why do we even need the semi-automatic weapons, that the bump stocks serve to automate?
962 2018-02-22 20:46:32 The President said, "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"
963 2018-02-22 20:46:12 Stocks ready to ship worldwide
964 2018-02-22 20:45:52 It won't belong before our fishermen catch everything and ruin what stocks there are....also who will they sell too as we English people only eat deep fried battered cod?
965 2018-02-22 20:45:51 RXMD picking up again, another missed smh, should of stayed looking at OTC stocks
966 2018-02-22 20:45:43 Totally agree, no one is talking about taking away the right to own guns responsibly. It's about stopping the murderers using semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. And it has nothing to do with the Dems either, many Dems own guns too.
967 2018-02-22 20:45:38 With 15 minutes to go before the close and the reports from those four stocks, the account is down $66.  

#RipsAndDips
968 2018-02-22 20:44:49 Look back in history when they used bump stocks on muskets.
969 2018-02-22 20:44:41 Many measures can be taken. For starters I agree with the bump stocks ban. Definitely the FBI should start following up on tips. Could install auto locking doors in all hallways like hospitals that could cut shooters off from sections. At least one cop at all schools.
970 2018-02-22 20:44:40 Is your desire to keep jump stocks legal more important than the life of one kid?  Rapid fire allows more kills before anyone can stop the shooter.
971 2018-02-22 20:44:33 Sometimes people forget that interest is an income stream for bonds and dividends are excess funds after reinvestment for stocks.
972 2018-02-22 20:44:29 Doing the right thing means putting in regulations on assault rifles & bump stocks, better background checks, etc..  Glad to hear the @NRA is on board @realDonaldTrump , and that you'll be working on pushing these gun regulation bills through congress! Make America Safe Again!
973 2018-02-22 20:43:49 A lot of stocks flagging for a possible b/o tmrw, looking at 3 strikes OTM calls (or puts) on select beta stocks #staynimble #FOMC
974 2018-02-22 20:43:45 #Soybeans closed lower. Corn and wheat were higher. Livestock mixed. US #Dollar turned lower on talk US may be slow in raising rates.  This helped US stocks and most commodities today.
975 2018-02-22 20:43:40 Lots of strong, resilient growth stocks out there -- I have a big front- and back-burner watch list. That said, until the market confirms a new uptrend, good stocks can go bad in a hurry. Usually better to wait.
976 2018-02-22 20:43:29 Mr. President: talk about reducing the chances of a shooting like in Florida is all fine. But please do not compromise 2A rights by raising age limit or banning bump stocks through ATF.
977 2018-02-22 20:43:28 What do you think this says about future price of dividend payers stocks that still have yields above treasury?
978 2018-02-22 20:43:02 I believe bazooka’s as well as machine guns are illegal, which is why I believe bump stocks should be illegal
979 2018-02-22 20:42:58 I understand, but I disagree. I think banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines would make a huge impact, and the country is ready culturally and politically to do that. Making this about banning all guns hurts the chances of getting anything done.
980 2018-02-22 20:42:55 7yr Treasury Auction garnered a C- rating.  MBS down to just +3bps, off of earlier highs at 22bps; and Stocks are off highs, with the DOW at 200, which was up to 289 earlier.
981 2018-02-22 20:42:45 @realDonaldTrump do not go weak on the 2nd amendment, bump stocks and raising an age limit will do nothing, an age limit doesn't stop underage drinking and it wont stop murders. Shitty parenting, shitty society, and shitty media has created the problem, try fixing those first.
982 2018-02-22 20:42:33 I don't have a problem with that. But defending the 2nd amendment and defending bump stocks and AR-15s are not necessarily the same thing.
983 2018-02-22 20:42:31 Glad you are promoting Black History! Please take some time to take a firm stance to ban assault weapons and bump stocks in the House too. Use your platform to combat the NRA party (Republican Party bought out by them) lies, smokescreens, and redirects.
984 2018-02-22 20:42:30 Le pétrole soutenu par les exportations et les stocks américains
985 2018-02-22 20:42:30 I love my guns and would be all for eliminating bump stocks. The serve no purpose.
986 2018-02-22 20:42:27 And I thought the ATF didn't have the authority to regulate bump stocks? We already had this discussion after the MASSACRE in Las Vegas.
987 2018-02-22 20:42:26 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX,NDX bottom signals apparently emerging, the NDX potentially completing today.
988 2018-02-22 20:42:24 You don't pay them enough for this shit. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. We will accept nothing less!!! The ban used to work, until the Nazi GOP legalized them. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization If you can't go without terrorists' money, then just go.
989 2018-02-22 20:42:22 Where can I buy the stocks bro
990 2018-02-22 20:42:16 I feel this goes beyond the typical right-left partisanship. I am against gun ban. But banning bump stocks, semi automatic guns which fire nonstop rounds should NOT be in the hands of civilians. Also the ease with which these guns can be bought and sold is something to change.
991 2018-02-22 20:41:36 Did you read the NRA statement?  There is nothing wrong with the statement. There most certainly is nothing in there discrediting school children. Opinion, I think they should take a stronger stand against bump stocks.
992 2018-02-22 20:41:35 TOUGHER background checks, Do SOMETHING about people with mental health issues to ensure they can't get guns, raise the age to purchase ANY weapon to 21, but NO RESTRICTIONS on "Bump Stocks" or ANY OTHER gun accessories. Why put restrictions on law abiding people..........
993 2018-02-22 20:41:13 Ban assault rifles. Bump stocks were from the LV shooting, let's PREVENT mass shootings, not just clean up from them.
994 2018-02-22 20:41:07 Bump stocks are a novelty item that have zero use for legitimate defense or hunting. They exist for 2 reasons: to make gun owners feel cool by having a fake automatic weapon, and to spray bullets quickly in a haphazard fashion. They're dumb. Get rid of them...
995 2018-02-22 20:40:44 $EA $TTWO $ATVI these esports are not going away. Will be the largest sport in due time. These stocks are very tradeable and have a good chance of doubling again. Throw $AMZN in with their #Twitch
996 2018-02-22 20:40:41 I don't think the discussion is taking away all firearms. For anything to get done, I believe in a compromise. 1. No citizen should have access to an AR-15 or bump stocks. 2. Tighter background checks. If you are not a mass murderer, whats your problem?
997 2018-02-22 20:40:28 damn it.  I just want all of my #stocks to close green everyday.  is that so much to ask
998 2018-02-22 20:40:27 Le pétrole soutenu par les exportations et les stocks américains
999 2018-02-22 20:40:21 So here's my question.  If my stocks rose 25% last year, my monthly pay increased $600 and everyone has a job, then what is wrong with our President.  Isn't having a job and more money in your pocket a good thing?  Better than no pay raise under Obama with a 3% increase in stocks
1000 2018-02-22 20:40:21 Bump stocks can go. Binary triggers are still a go.
1001 2018-02-22 20:40:04 Try getting support for funding more research into the causes of mental illness and how we can all help.  Thise affected who are irrational will find a way to hurt and kill whether they have access to bump stocks or not.  A car or a truck can be used as a weapon.
1002 2018-02-22 20:40:03 Taking the rights away from men and women who can serve our military at 18 is not the right answer. Bump stocks are not that great. it is still our right to choose. Once again it is the upstanding citizens that will lose freedoms. From the actions of criminals.
1003 2018-02-22 20:39:56 Look at what Florida passed after they voted down discussions on banning of bump stocks. They decided to put “in god we trust” signs in all schools. That passed. We are in the freaking upside down.
1004 2018-02-22 20:39:56 You'll rag on this Trump post but do you give credit to Trump for asking Congress to ban bump stocks? Even CNN has reported on that request.
1005 2018-02-22 20:39:44 Furthermore, do you honestly believe that we should send an 18 year old off to war, but he doesn't have the right to own a personal firearm?

And why bump stocks? Because the FBI claims one was used in Vegas while lying about everything else related to that event?
1006 2018-02-22 20:39:07 But your employers at the NRA already told you that you guys in DC cant ban bump stocks.
1007 2018-02-22 20:38:25 Binary triggers will replace bump stocks. 
1008 2018-02-22 20:37:58 I recall you taking 7 stocks with your Fox in crews last night
1009 2018-02-22 20:37:44 Agreed.  Armed security guards makes the most sense for solving this issue.  Banning bump stocks won’t accomplish anything imo.
1010 2018-02-22 20:37:42 You don’t need bump stocks and large clips for the 2nd amendment. But thank you again for proving you’re not interested in actual change. Just your guns. No reason to continue this, it’s just going to go in circles.
1011 2018-02-22 20:37:37 People somehow trust Tom Price, who's used congressional information to make millions trading stocks.
1012 2018-02-22 20:37:35 I don't recall the 2A mentioning bump stocks so no that isn't your right.

1014 2018-02-22 20:37:26 Bump stocks will be replaced with binary triggers.
1015 2018-02-22 20:36:51 The problem is the amount of rounds that can be fired with the semi automatic weapon because of large clips, bump stocks, etc. making them a killing machine of innocent Americans. Stop the silly games  to protect the NRA. Do something!!
1016 2018-02-22 20:36:50 Sounds like country kids might miss out on one of the normal pursuits when growing up. In truth if a youth wishes to cause mayhem with a gun, they will find one. Ban bump stocks , arm suitable teachers, or employ experts .imho.
1017 2018-02-22 20:36:41 No bump stocks. Police an FBI need to figure it out also. This kid was a powder keg waiting to go off. And he finally snaped.
1018 2018-02-22 20:36:41 @AltonBertie get in here with your notepad and take some notes! Well, except if you already have iPhone stocks.
1019 2018-02-22 20:36:27 I don't like it when stocks run hard in a short period of time. They always give up gains and become traders' playgrounds. That said, $RCAR is putting in higher lows. The SkinGun is going to go through the FDA process. And if the results are solid, $12 will be undervalued.

1021 2018-02-22 20:35:56 The only way to conserve fish stocks is to stop industrial fishing altogether .. stop dumping plastics in our oceans and stop fukushima radiation further damaging our beautiful Pacific ocean
1022 2018-02-22 20:35:35 Yeah, it's a gimmick anyway. Like the half-baked non-solutions we see presented every time...(10 round vs. 20 round vs. 30 round mags), black guns vs. wood ones, bump stocks, auto vs. semi-auto...

Our debate looks like this every time:
Ban guns vs. "my cold dead hands = gridlock
1023 2018-02-22 20:35:27 So Anna, are you saying your going to take on the US army one day with bump stocks?
1024 2018-02-22 20:35:08 why are people so against giving up stuff (bump stocks & raising gun age) even if it means potentially lives will be saved. smh
1025 2018-02-22 20:35:07 well I hope you at least gave them a lecture on the evils of bump stocks, high capacity mags & scary black rifles... 
1026 2018-02-22 20:34:36 time to invest in broadband companies.  their stocks should go up
1027 2018-02-22 20:33:56 Changes with bump stocks. 12 to 15 rounds a minute otherwise.
1028 2018-02-22 20:33:52 Semi automatic & bump stocks not "ban all guns" if that is what you heard you weren't listening
1029 2018-02-22 20:33:49 That’s why the stocks always go up for gun manufacturers after mass shootings, right?
1030 2018-02-22 20:33:40 First they come for my bump stocks then they’ll come for my tanks. Slippery slope man.
1031 2018-02-22 20:33:37 yep some very good stocks and some decent stocks but overall a weak Sector compared to the broaden market in the last 3 years
1032 2018-02-22 20:33:35 Personally I can't stand bump stocks because you lose accuracy.  But:

"Shall not be infringed"
1033 2018-02-22 20:33:21 Things I'm curious to know:  1. How much are sales of bump stocks to gun industry?  2. How much are sales of guns for 18 to 21 year olds?  I imagine both are relatively low and gun industry won't bat an eye at these changes. Will these changes actually help? That I do not know.
1034 2018-02-22 20:32:54 I had fell back and started buying more stocks but crypto is like selling dope it’s addicting when you winning. Fuck the safe bet.
1035 2018-02-22 20:32:30 I live in AZ deep in the heart of gun loving,  open carry,  etc ppl. I own a handgun and enjoy the range myself,  not NRA, but half of my clients are. Not one of them is against background checks,  21 age limit and no bump stocks. It's not the ppl, it's the heads.
1036 2018-02-22 20:32:29 I trade stocks and options... I HODL Cryptos ... Will start a trading group soon
1037 2018-02-22 20:32:20 That individual clearly wanted to harm people and he would have regardless of what tools were available to him. The firearms he purchased weren't simple things, he bought them over many years and modified many of them with bump stocks.
1038 2018-02-22 20:32:17 POLL: Do you think Maine should ban "bump stocks?'
1039 2018-02-22 20:32:15 But the constitution explicitly protects my right to bump stocks
1040 2018-02-22 20:32:13 @KylieJenner has the ability to wipe 1.1Bn off a stocks market cap with one tweet  #Snapchat
1041 2018-02-22 20:32:02 Well if you thought the memorandum to tell Justice to look into banning bump stocks was an executive order that banned bump stocks, which also can't happen by EO? I can only go by what you say. Someone is telling you garbage, and certain networks misinform the public on purpose.
1042 2018-02-22 20:31:44 and what about the AR-15? bump stocks are a pretty much moot point if anyone can buy an AR-15.
1043 2018-02-22 20:31:29 Great, now you will lose your base people. Bump stocks are not even an issue. While your at it. Up the age for military recruitment. Those are 18 yr olds joining to possibly die After all, 18 yr olds can't have a gun.
1044 2018-02-22 20:31:22 Donald Trump, Tories, Climate Change, plastic pollution, decreased fish stocks, high food price raises, stagnant wages, NHS cuts, breaches of human rights by Government. It's a lot worse since 2010
1045 2018-02-22 20:31:17 Ah no leí el tweet anterior. De ser así, el precio debería saltar más. Y lo haría. 5MM menos aún es un toco para stocks.
1046 2018-02-22 20:31:06 Who said anything about confiscating weapons? We are talking about banning AR15 type weapons. Why did you lie? 
 
Hell, you clowns wouldn't even ban bump stocks.
1047 2018-02-22 20:31:05 Confusing the language helps their cause.  That's why rushing legislation about bump stocks is probably not a good idea.  The definitions, language, and details need to be exact so it doesn't pull in tons of irrelevant categories of guns and accessories.
1048 2018-02-22 20:30:41 Or some of the ancient stocks that are dying so we don't see anymore of those forced blockchain integrations
1049 2018-02-22 20:30:03 Did you mention mr president you approved bump stocks? Asking for a friend
1050 2018-02-22 20:29:43 Trump weakened the background check system and the bill in congress is the only way to outlaw bump stocks  he is just blowing hot air as usual
1051 2018-02-22 20:29:42 Now ima buy all the bump stocks i can before theyre gone hahaa
1052 2018-02-22 20:29:41 what a man!!!! in summer, too. you'll be glad of the stocks!!!
1053 2018-02-22 20:29:35 Trump is actually taking steps to make guns harder to get and the ban of bump stocks is huge. First time in his presidency where I actually feel good about his actions
1054 2018-02-22 20:29:33 I don't know why we are banning bump stocks when it's the people's fault, not the weapon's fault
1055 2018-02-22 20:29:24 I apologize for the people who follow me solely for stocks. I'm just collecting UOIP. Final decision on IPR is March 3rd, which is a set deadline. They won the last 8 might I remind you. Should make me a pretty penny 
1056 2018-02-22 20:29:21 @Porsha4real  is thaa fool. She keep trying and getting no where. She juss needa chalk that up to tha game and stop trying find friends she too grown for that. She needa trying start a family and invest in some stocks or real estate
1057 2018-02-22 20:29:17 I'm not sure I agree, but it'd at least be a start. I agree completely about the bump stocks though, they need to go.
1058 2018-02-22 20:29:12 Can't wait to see the headlines from financial news networks:

"Pork Belly stocks up 219% from last year!"
1059 2018-02-22 20:29:06 If battlefield weapons were used, there’d likely be more deaths. AR-15s are hunting rifles, with bump stocks making them assault rifles. They’re banning bump stocks. Extended magazines do need to go though.
1060 2018-02-22 20:29:06 Hmm.. should i do another small account challenge with stocks? Its been a while since a traded penny stocks. What do you all think?
1061 2018-02-22 20:28:55 *buying pork stocks now*
1062 2018-02-22 20:28:54 Just discovered crypto, saw ETH at $14, and didn't buy in and bought stocks instead.
1063 2018-02-22 20:28:41 How about for a middle of the road. WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER OUR GUNS - that is a given. Pres. Trump signed ban on bump stocks. I can live with that. But no one will violate my 2A rights, especially the govt! Founding Fathers put that in to stop tyranny which we see increasingly
1064 2018-02-22 20:27:55 How are they conflicting?  The NRA supports and pushes gun safety,education and training. They don’t sell any guns. They protect legal gun owners rights. They support smart gun laws. The supported ban on bump stocks years ago. A mental kid who fell through the system killed 17!
1065 2018-02-22 20:27:39 Lot of talk about machine guns!  Trigger groups are available to make your AR 15 full automatic,lots of paper work and permits to register trigger group full back ground check! But can be done! It ain’t free $10to$15,000! Put bump stocks in same class as FULL AUTOMATIC (No Ban)
1066 2018-02-22 20:27:35 @jimcramer James, we need you! Why are stocks, all of them, Dropping like a Curling Stone after 3pm the last few days? They would open big! It's like they're trying to set us up!
1067 2018-02-22 20:27:30 He has forgotten “ banning bump stocks” so what are talking about? His choice between $$ and the right thing to do?  $$ wins every time.
1068 2018-02-22 20:27:22 like the answer isn’t pull video games, donny. how about we pull assault rifles and bump stocks? how about we help those with mental illnesses get help? and prevent them from owning guns. jesus h christ
1069 2018-02-22 20:27:20 Immigrants had a deal of a live time  handed to them on a silver platter, and the dem leaders prided screwed them. Bump stocks will bee banned son as it gets to the presidents desk.  And finally most news outlets have the rest of his stance. Hint: NRA is going to hate it and base
1070 2018-02-22 20:27:18 For all that is good, logical, and researched ban bump stocks and assault weapons!!!!!
1071 2018-02-22 20:27:12 $MYSZ $1.81 +40%
1072 2018-02-22 20:27:09 Tell me, word for word, where the Constitution says that it's your right to have assault weapons and bump stocks. It's ok, I'll wait.
1073 2018-02-22 20:26:24 You mean safer by banning assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, raising age limits on purchasers, eliminating loopholes, and enacting common sense gun control, right?  Guns in schools is NOT the answer.
1074 2018-02-22 20:26:20 Lots of stocks making lots of tops. #nasdaq #dow #sp500
1075 2018-02-22 20:26:18 I don't want to harden our school's! At least a hardened children! This man is a stooge,a boob and ignorant pos!I wonder if he'd feel the same way if his kids got gunned down in school! Get them off the street: that means bump stocks, AR-15s and other weapons of mass destruction!
1076 2018-02-22 20:25:59 Boi, 1v1 me: 2 stocks and 6 minutes on Smashville. Don't you dare ditto my Jar Jar Binks.
1077 2018-02-22 20:25:49 AR-15s are common but theyre the same as other hunting rifles. Bump stocks is what turns them into assault rifles. Hes banning those. The VT shooter killed 32 people with 2 handguns so the argument it would decrease casualties is false. Banning them would simply just be symbolic.
1078 2018-02-22 20:25:45 Je pense que les algo de trading achètent tous les stocks des boîtes qui name-droppent "blockchain" ou "bitcoin" dans leurs communications financières
1079 2018-02-22 20:25:45 @realDonaldTrump got folks afraid with this ban of bump stocks. What? You say they have 3d printers and don't care about this retarded ban?
1080 2018-02-22 20:25:42 He was able to find trees in a land known for sand and not trees, and had a business make gun stocks.
1081 2018-02-22 20:25:39 Mr President, if you really away our rights to bump stocks then you are infringing upon our Second Amendment Rights...the very thing you promised not to do.

Why raise the legal age to 21? If you can die for your country with a firearm in hand then you can own one.
1082 2018-02-22 20:25:38 If we are going to outlaw bump stocks, do we also outlaw Jerry Miculek?
1083 2018-02-22 20:25:37 I don’t want anyone besides existing school security to be armed. It’s more about the common sense stuff. Stricter background checks, mental health, eliminating bump stocks, high capacity mags, and “semi” autos. Increased penalty for illegally obtained guns.
1084 2018-02-22 20:25:14 Will someone tell Marco Rubio that butt stocks are legal and easily accessible? And then they are much much much faster than pistols.
1085 2018-02-22 20:24:59 So the financial world now depends on people like @kyliejenner to tell us they are frustrated at a product. Like that is what made us a prosperous nation. #Sickening. #stocks #StockMarket #Snapchat #investing
1086 2018-02-22 20:24:54 I have 16 charts opened across my upper screen array. Yest & today when the SPY makes a move each one of the stocks on those charts went up and down in parallel. thats not Human
1087 2018-02-22 20:24:41 So the Vegas shooter didn't have the infamous bump stocks then? Come on man! Nobody needs a damn AR-15!
1088 2018-02-22 20:24:24 E.g. bump stocks on an AR15 are literally useless for other than "fun" (on a range) and indiscriminate killing of ppl in crowds, AFAICT.
1089 2018-02-22 20:24:18 You are making a mistake on bump fire stocks, sir. This arbitrarily moving of the goalpost has got to stop. The oath is to a document that clearly says "shall not be infringed". If you contradict that oath you will end up judged the same as Obama, the Bushes, the Clintons, etc.
1090 2018-02-22 20:23:11 The gun, because people have saved lives with guns. It’s just not in the news. Which is actually a good thing because only tragedy’s get so much attention. Vegas could’ve happened anyway. A well placed shot is better anyway. Bump stocks were actually created for handicapped.
1091 2018-02-22 20:23:05 You gotta love Americans. They think bump stocks magically turn any gun into a machine gun 
1092 2018-02-22 20:22:58 You are awesome!! Thanks for pointing that out and wanting to expand what weapons to reduce!! I can offer a deal :) How about if we simply get rid of semi-automatic pistols, bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles then? That is what was used in almost 70% of shootings since 1987.
1093 2018-02-22 20:22:26 I find it disgusting that many #states invest #pension funds in gun companies.  I do not want my state taxes to go to #gun stocks for one.  #GunReformNow #NRAMoneyNoVote #NRABloodMoney
1094 2018-02-22 20:22:25 @DLoesch @NRA How can you say that the media loves shootings? The gun companies stocks go up after a mass shooting, their profits get funneled into your organization via donations. Does that make you guys like shootings because donations rise?
1095 2018-02-22 20:22:22 Okay. I'm using that phrase because it's more concise than saying AR-15 style semi-automatic weapons outfitted with high-capacity ammunition magazines and bump stocks, which are frequently used by mass shooters these days.
1096 2018-02-22 20:22:21 Change his opinion about what? He wants security measures at school along with lot of policy changes. Raising the age to buy, banning bump stocks, mental Heath etc. What more do you want?

1098 2018-02-22 20:22:09 Bump stocks aren’t cheap , and people talking here Obviously do not understand the nomenclature of the item.
1099 2018-02-22 20:22:07 Some of the large stocks in Dow Jones have just stupid valuations, like McD, Home Depo, Boeing etc
1100 2018-02-22 20:22:06 Get rid of bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons
1101 2018-02-22 20:21:53 Ban bump stocks, AR-15s , registering guns, background checks, no sales at gun shows and transfer between private owners..
1102 2018-02-22 20:21:49 Yea he’s got their backs he APPROVED BUMP STOCKS back in 2010.
1103 2018-02-22 20:21:32 Mr president, you are only doing that to please the left, the guns are not the problem it takes a person to pull the trigger. Also, the kid bought the gun legally, background checks won't do shit if they are legal. One more thing, bump stocks do not make a gun a machine gun.
1104 2018-02-22 20:21:06 If you don’t want to frighten children, then ban ARs, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Close all the loopholes in background checks. And stop accepting NRA blood money and following their agenda @realDonaldTrump #GunControlNow #StopNRASponsoredTerrorism
1105 2018-02-22 20:21:06 Let’s see all the stocks booming for the weapon companies. Obscure agreements must be in place to even suggest this kind of solutions. God help Americans. #GunLawsNOW
1106 2018-02-22 20:21:05 No one had bump stocks when the 2nd amendment was written. You need to look back at history.
1107 2018-02-22 20:20:27 Not at all, I'm all for what President Trump is doing with his bill, in regards to no bump stocks and the age of 21 to purchase them, as well as more extensive background checks. Never in this countries history has "everyone and their mother" had access to AR-15s
1108 2018-02-22 20:20:16 I agree with this but these are not reasons to not ban a bump stock, if anything, these are reasons to ban bump stocks and more.
1109 2018-02-22 20:20:07 Banning bump stocks will solve nothing, banning guns will solve nothing, the only thing that will do is spark more government money poured into an already corrupt police system to search a sieze weapons from people, why not start by protecting the schools
1110 2018-02-22 20:19:57 I sense the turning of the tide in my philosophy... I just looked at 10 stocks and said to myself "short, short, short, short, short, short, short,short,short, short"
1111 2018-02-22 20:19:30 Not sure why sir.   Bump stocks DONT change the functing of the weapon. It doesn't make it faster.  A person can learn to operate as fast and more accurately without a bump stock.    Age 21?  Why?  They are allowed to drive at 16.  Cars are every bit as deadly as a firearm.
1112 2018-02-22 20:19:17 Bump stocks will not end gun violence. Having teachers carry will! They can get bump sticks on the streets at any given time. The other day there was a stabbing in a school in Pennsylvania where several people got stabbed. Are we going to ban knives?
1113 2018-02-22 20:19:13 There is no need for Jack or Jill Public to own a semi automatic weapon. You want a gun a hand gun for protection. If you are a Hunter you have a shot gun. No bump stocks are necessary.
1114 2018-02-22 20:19:01 TRUE ASSAULT WEAPONS BEING SOLD, SUCH AS AR 15 IS A LIE. TRUE ASSAULT RIFLES HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIRE FULL AND SEMI AUTOMATIC FIRE. THESE CANT BE LEGALLY SOLD IN USA. THAT IS WHY BUMP STOCKS WERE MADE. TO CHEAT THE RULES AND MAKE AR15s INTO FULL AUTOMATICS!
1115 2018-02-22 20:18:53 And the NRA backed politicians are now almost all backing bans on bump stocks, raising the age to buy a rifle, and tougher background checks.
1116 2018-02-22 20:18:39 Oh dear .  #SPX #stocks $ES $NQ. .... now I am sure it is a bear market
1117 2018-02-22 20:18:21 Many would easily give up bumpfire stocks and binary triggers in exchange for lifting the regs on suppressors.
1118 2018-02-22 20:18:10 Consider what s being DONE,  raise age requirement and ban bump stocks won't stop what happened.  He should have been listed as mental health risk, thus current NICS would have caught him. Then ATF drops ball like FBI
1119 2018-02-22 20:17:57 When I took that class in high school, the teacher just talked about stocks. It wasn’t a very good class.
1120 2018-02-22 20:17:31 I walked into publix and two employees were talking about a phone call in which the customer was looking for an item and then got made because it wasn't in stocks. She was just sharing her feelings about the situation in the entryway to the store
1121 2018-02-22 20:17:16 I think I have a record for worst blockchain pitches today. Newest one: Actor Trades Sports Teams Like Stocks with Blockchain Tech
1122 2018-02-22 20:17:15 $SNAP going down on some short term news. Should be temporary though! Still doing Great! #stocks #investing #Snapchat
1123 2018-02-22 20:16:41 I’m all in favor of banning bump stocks. I’m in favor of the age raise. Donald Trump is literally fighting the NRA to make semiautomatics nearly impossible to purchase, and in my opinion, it seems only logical that an insane person would purchase a semi-automatic rifle.
1124 2018-02-22 20:16:25 So far, the GOP blames:
Video games
Porn
Baggy pants
Not arming teachers
Mental illness

They haven’t blame:
Easy access to guns that legally allowed a disturbed person to buy multiple guns, ammo and bump stocks
1125 2018-02-22 20:16:23 Trump has also been working to make background check alot harsher and to ban bump stocks etc so get the whole story before making a statement on it. Cnn just shows clips of what they want you to see.
1126 2018-02-22 20:16:14 Awesome!!!
1127 2018-02-22 20:15:57 Me ........cos ego's here and ego's there then ends up going bloody everywhere ..... ..just like my stocks
1128 2018-02-22 20:15:53 Well some legislation is going to get passed the time around.  Bump stocks banned, improved background checks implemented, an AR-15 ban.  I for one am absolutely thrilled. Personally, I would also like to see existing AR-15s confiscated, but 3 outta 4 ain't bad.
1129 2018-02-22 20:15:51 TRUMP asked;"Why do we need Bump Stocks?" 
I ask; Why are Americans paying Income Taxes in contempt of the many SCOTUS rulings?
1130 2018-02-22 20:15:48 Raise min age for some guns, ban bump stocks, better screening, arm qualified teachers. What did BHO ever do again back whn he had both houses?
1131 2018-02-22 20:15:41 ****RED ALERT**** - I HAVE BEEN IN THE LAB ALL WEEK STUDYING THE ALGO'S. WHAT I HAVE UNCOVERED IS MASSIVE! THERE APPEARS TO BE AN EPIC PRICE MOVE COMING IN THE BITCOIN, US STOCKS, BONDS AND THE DOLLAR. IT APPEARS TO BE ON THE DOWNSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1133 2018-02-22 20:15:15 Measuring stocks of phytoplankton allows scientists to measure carbon that the communities hold. Scientists compare how much carbon is in each community. Carbon fixing is really important in slowing climate change @portscafesci
1134 2018-02-22 20:15:11 Just watched a very insecure Wayne Lapierre, who at one point I knew very well, speak to a panel of people at CPAC. His answers were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect!  Let's leave bumping stocks to inside traders and push to deregulate wall street.
1135 2018-02-22 20:15:11 @realDonaldTrump you ban bump stocks you lose my vote.

1138 2018-02-22 20:14:46 My fear in banning is that if we can't implement existing laws, that ban things, how in the hell do we think we can solve school shootings with a few bans. You can learn and turn a handgun or AR to fire more RPS, without stocks. There is so much more this issue.
1139 2018-02-22 20:14:45 Pro Gun Advocates: We will not budge on our stance. We will not give you a single gun. We need bump stocks, the AR15, large magazines, unlimited ammo and magazines.  We want 18 year olds to be able to buy them all. No compromise.
1140 2018-02-22 20:14:36 Well I think the 3 Trump proposed are a good start, further expansion on mental checks, have to be 21 and over to purchase, and ban bump stocks, those 3 alone would’ve stopped at least Vegas and FL

1142 2018-02-22 20:14:28 There some good stocks that are a good price compared to a few month backs.
1143 2018-02-22 20:14:25 A big gun control talking point is AR-15s are assault rifles and weapons of war. Theyre actually the same as other hunting rifles and only become assault rifles when bump stocks are used. Trumps banning those. Kids being traumatized doesnt excuse for not researching on the topic.
1144 2018-02-22 20:13:45 Socks and sandals DOES NOT = socks and stocks.
1145 2018-02-22 20:13:41 well, that's 3 baldies waiting to go in the stocks. least one benefit we have is if we spray some rainex on our heads the water will just roll off! 
1146 2018-02-22 20:13:37 @bernieandsid The DUMB ASS has to stop with U guys re: assault guns. Google: defintion of assault guns. Real assault guns can fire full & semi automatic mode. U cant legallly buy full automatic fire guns in USA. That's why "bump stocks" cheated the rules to mimic a full auto fire
1147 2018-02-22 20:13:21 Bump stocks are an infinitesimal part of the gun problem. Banning them does nothing to get to the root of the problem but lets Trump say he did something. @harveyjkaye
1148 2018-02-22 20:13:15 TRUMP asked;"Y do we need Bump Stocks?"
I ask;Why do we need Congress 2 VIOLATE The 10th Amend LAW &You sign their CRIMINAL Bills?
1149 2018-02-22 20:12:58 I don't see the point in raising the gun limit? I'm open to hearing a counter. I think it does punish law-abiding citizens. The main issue as far as mass shootings go are these assault rifles and bump stocks. Seems like they keep trying to ignore that.
1150 2018-02-22 20:12:53 You have legislating sitting in the Senate for universal gun background checks and need to ban the sales of rifles with large magazines that can & are used in mass shootings.  Bump stocks must be banned also.  You’ve already screwed taxes to benefit the rich.  Protect our kids!
1151 2018-02-22 20:12:39 R u still in $HNET?
1152 2018-02-22 20:12:28 Bump stocks are not a #2ndAmendment issue. #bumpstocks are not guns.
1153 2018-02-22 20:12:03 Ban bump stocks=open door to ban any accessory they deem dangerous

Raise age to 21. Median shooter age, 34. Drinking age is 21, any underage drinkers out there? 

BG checks focusing on mental health.  Who decides what mentally healthy is? Look at some of the proposals...
#2A
1154 2018-02-22 20:11:56 Bump stocks are getting banned. They're an accessory. How many shots can you get off with a handgun in each hand and more in your book bag?
1155 2018-02-22 20:11:49 Causes of gun violence according to Trump:
- video games
- movies
- unarmed teachers
- gun free zones
- bump stocks

Not causes of gun violence according to Trump:
- guns
1156 2018-02-22 20:11:36 Let us just say for stupidity sake this young man was not able to purchase these types of guns and ammunition would we be here today? What about bump stocks added to these weapons would Vegas have happened! What is more important peoples lives or a gun?
1157 2018-02-22 20:11:30 Like the abortions they’re trying to ban? Swap out guns and bump stocks for abortion and that’ll end that debate too.
1158 2018-02-22 20:11:24 You have legislating sitting in the House for universal gun back ground checks and need to ban the sales of rifles with large magazines that can & are used in mass shootings.  Bump stocks must be banned also.  You’ve already screwed taxes to benefit the rich.  Protect our kids!
1159 2018-02-22 20:11:13 The stable genius should be leading the agenda here. Not talking of bump stocks which are at Congress already but offering some sensible solution. 

I most definitely want to see a reduction after witnessing 2 shootings. The victims are more than the ones injured others get PTSD
1160 2018-02-22 20:10:57 Before you go throwing blanket assumptions on an entire generation, maybe you shouldn’t throw out accusations that could be disproven. Obama himself didn’t call for the legality of bump stocks, the admin. couldn’t technically outlaw them based on the language of the law presented

1166 2018-02-22 20:10:38 Even in that case a rifle is much much better. Stocks, barrels, grips, sights, cheek pads, lasers, all of these are much more practical or only found on a rifle
1167 2018-02-22 20:10:17 That's a blatant lie. They were only banned from sale from 94 to 2004. republicans allowed ban to expire in 2004. They've been legal to purchase since then. Obama tried to reban them, bump stocks & several types of ammunition. Republicans refused to legislate. All you do is lie.
1168 2018-02-22 20:10:16 @NRA .@housegop .@senategrop So glad to see #NRA supporting ban of bump stocks on .@CNN last night. Let's get that piece of legislation through. She also supports federal background checks and states being held accountable. Let's get it done. .@SenFeinstein Right now. Start.

1173 2018-02-22 20:09:37 Trump just proposed raising the age requirement on guns, having more extensive background checks, and banning bump stocks
1174 2018-02-22 20:09:35 It’s extremely disingenuous for a reporter to put out a headline that ‘teachers are retiring on gun stocks’ when most have no idea how their money is invested, not even the stock/bond allocation, and don’t have the option to reject individual stocks.
1175 2018-02-22 20:09:24 Even as pro-2A as I am, I was surprised bump stocks even existed. I fail to see the point in banning fully-auto guns when you can buy a device that turns a semi-auto into a fully-auto. Most Republicans ik would support banning bump stocks but the Left wants more than that 
1176 2018-02-22 20:09:18  @Wealthfront rolling out a Risk Parity strategy to customers. Very, very interesting. I wonder what the target vol. is (same as stocks?). Do we front run ILBs ahead of this?
1177 2018-02-22 20:09:14 Enforcement is always reactive, as many of us have been saying for years. Especially with respect to the laws and policies that make it impossible for families and authorities to commit someone who is mentally ill and a threat. 
Bump stocks are red meat for the left. 1/
1178 2018-02-22 20:09:03 Yep, pick out 2-3 stocks and have fun trading them all year.
1179 2018-02-22 20:08:43 @AnnSummers My wife Gloria spotted in your Belfast store a large sign advising you had a massive stock sale. As she is interested in the BDSM scene and has just finished her own dungeon can you tell me how big these stocks are. We were just too embarrassed to go in and ask.
1180 2018-02-22 20:08:42 Except for all the parts where I said exactly what we should be doing? Did you miss where I said we actually force people to do classes every other year, raise the age to buy guns, higher tax on ammo, no more bump stocks, and actually enforce background checks...
1181 2018-02-22 20:08:41 Wtf. Don’t sell out now and listen to the evil left on their ideas about bump stocks and ghost guns. Don’t fall for it!
1182 2018-02-22 20:08:38 The issue with banning bump stocks is that it creates technical issues which could allow the ATF in a less-ethical administration to ban semiautomatic rifles by fiat. Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater!
1183 2018-02-22 20:08:13 Just like you did with the BATFE and bump stocks? I think the GOA needs my dues more than you!
1184 2018-02-22 20:08:13 Sam, not ‘if’ they control the power, but ‘when’ they control it. Your attitude is so extreme that no one will vote for those who think like you. You think the founding fathers had bump stocks and mental illness in mind when they drafted the second amendment? No, they didn’t.
1185 2018-02-22 20:07:45 Be part of the solution not the problem. Bump stocks we don't need. Changing age we can deal with. We all need to compromise.
1186 2018-02-22 20:07:44 Where in the constitution does it say you have a right bear bump stocks?
1187 2018-02-22 20:07:28 Having teachers carry guns is RIDICULOUS. THEY ARE TEACHERS NOT SOLDIERS!
TRUMP REFUSED TO SERVE!!!
TEACHERS NEED TO TEACH
THE BAN REQUEST IS 4 ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH 1 LIFE? THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!! IS IT?
1188 2018-02-22 20:07:22 And this time, gun sales didn't rise as much because @realDonaldTrump won't talk about actual gun control, but bump stocks prices rose after #45 announced he was amenable to a bump stock ban. The @NRA has trained their minions well.
1189 2018-02-22 20:07:00 Anytime a reactive solution is suggested to stop mass slaughter, I know the NRA's agenda is being pushed. We need serious proactive gun laws, including banning assault weapons, high capacity mags, bump stocks, etc. It will take single-issue votes.
1190 2018-02-22 20:06:57 Nah. You fell for it! Back in October they were for the ATF ONLY “further regulating” bump stocks, but NOT Congress passing a law banning them! ATF determined that it does not have the legal authority to regulate this. Trump/NRA wants ATF rule or EA but not a law. Smoke/mirrors!
1191 2018-02-22 20:06:38 Money managers have no idea how to value companies any more. In a market where stocks just go up with quantitative easing PE's have become forgotten.
1192 2018-02-22 20:06:32 @RepMikeJohnson Do the right thing!!!!! Get a bill on floor to Ban bump stocks and assault weapons then vote for the ban!
1193 2018-02-22 20:06:18 I’m supportive of bump stocks.  But agree with everything else stated above
1194 2018-02-22 20:06:15 growing my hair out to get two braids or flat twist,  getting a baby husky, a full leg tattoo, while getting more suits, sniper rifles. attending more day time events over night time turn ups. and i’ll switch from paying someone to handle my stocks to me handling my own.
1195 2018-02-22 20:06:14 What about a 10 year outlook for stocks. Could one ignore Politics?
1196 2018-02-22 20:06:12 If you start banning guns, people are gonna find other ways to kill. It won't matter that much but I do think raising the purchasing age should be a thing as well as banning bump stocks.
1197 2018-02-22 20:05:47 Who silenced you? Provide proof... youre trying to do the bait and switch tactic we notice and don’t buy it. You’re trying to silence an organization you don’t agree with by making them look as tho they are evil remember the nra was against bump stocks obama signed it into law
1198 2018-02-22 20:05:37 Please think about gun control. U need Congress in on this. They may make some small @concessions like bump stocks or background checks but this does not get to root of problem. How does making cuts in healthcare resolve mental health issues?
1199 2018-02-22 20:05:37 the problem is 1 or 2 million shares on a 9 cents stock is absolutely nothing its easy to manipulate or dump if ever "real" volume comes in its happening with so many CSE stocks
1200 2018-02-22 20:05:32 Megan McCain is so full of it. Banning Bump Stocks and Semi Automatic weapons does not take away your 2nd Amendment rights. U have the right to bear arms not the  right to every weapon under the heavens. You should not be allowed to have military weapons unless u r military.
1201 2018-02-22 20:05:23 Sorry, semi autos with bump stocks.
1202 2018-02-22 20:05:12 TRUMP asked; "Y do we need Bump Stocks?"
I ask; Y do We need $152 TRILLION in UNFUNDED Liabilities & WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT?
1203 2018-02-22 20:04:47 Ok. I'd like them to read the Constitution, not go from emotion. With thst I'd agree that raising the age to 21 for purchasing might be a good idea. Bump stocks, ya that's a good idea anyway. Though most long guns you'd want to put them on wouldn't need them.
1204 2018-02-22 20:04:36 Ya know, ban bump stocks yes
Mental health yes, school security yes!! but if your going to raise the present age limit
to buy guns no!
1205 2018-02-22 20:04:29 so u trade options because of the lower price vs the stock price? options are the same idea as trading stocks, its just the money needed to trade is less basically? is this right?
1206 2018-02-22 20:04:26 What happens to the bump-stocks that are already here..?
1207 2018-02-22 20:04:23 Watching @GwenNgwenya on Talking stocks with @brucebusiness so impressed.....welcome back to @Our_DA make us all proud.
1208 2018-02-22 20:04:11 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
1209 2018-02-22 20:04:11 It's not just bump stocks and assault weapons, we need comprehensive gun control.
1210 2018-02-22 20:04:10 Man, I have a feeling that all this gun control talk is only going to result in low ammunition stocks. After Sandy Hook you had to go to the store all the time to try and find some 9mm ammo. #ThursdayThoughts #2A #NRA
1211 2018-02-22 20:03:49 Gun control advocates: we want better backgrounds checks, no bump stocks and no high capacity magazines. We want to feel safe at school and in public. 

NRA (whiny voice): they’re coming for your guns.
1212 2018-02-22 20:03:40 Bump-stocks, Armed Teachers, Background Checks, Mental Illness and Age Limits,  are all halfway measures that don't deal with the big picture.Simply more kicking o can down the road. Exec.Order Ban
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A MASS SHOOTING WITHOUT ASSAULT WEAPONSt @realDonaldTrump
1213 2018-02-22 20:03:36 Where does th constitution say anything about bump stocks? You don’t have a right to modify your arms just bear them...
1214 2018-02-22 20:03:25 Meh, size is overrated.
I've got my 6", so I am happy.

And notice how I said "Regulated" meaning that it's the only item that can't be bought online.
I've had barrels, uppers, BCGs, stocks all delivered directly to my front door.
Those companies won't just disappear.
1215 2018-02-22 20:03:21 Make modifications like bump stocks illegal, and bring back Universal Health Care with a Strong Mental Health Care System, give schools the funds they need to hire adequate security, license gun owners, just like car drivers, make them take safety courses, and renew licenses.
1216 2018-02-22 20:03:19 re fade here in the markets many of these stocks should test lows again Looking for a short trade here on $NVDA going red again
1217 2018-02-22 20:03:11 Lethal??? Trump has already done more for gun regulation than Obama ever did. He's working on a ban for bump stocks, and raising the purchasing age to 21. And I am actually for both of those
1218 2018-02-22 20:02:58 Ah but only a gun is intended to be not just dangerous but deadly and bump stocks make them even more so, and not potentially either. Why are you people so opposed to common sense gun control? I have a right to free speech too but not if I falsely yell fire in a crowded place
1219 2018-02-22 20:02:52 Okay, fair do's, you are part way there now.  But, you missed out banning semi automatic assault type rifles.  You've caught up with the Vegas shooting with the bump stocks ban, now catch up with last weeks mass murder.
1220 2018-02-22 20:02:47 "Gun stock are rallying" USA Today 2/15/18 "Gun stocks rise" Fortune 2/15/18 "Why investors bet on gun sales after a mass shooting" The Atlantic 10/3/17 "Sales of AR 15 rifles rise in Lee County, Fla. after mass shootings."

1221 2018-02-22 20:02:40 Knowledge is Power. Knowledge can make you more $$$. Every Wednesday we're going to have "Ask Pat." Time to ask will be between 10 and 12.  You ask the questions. I'll answer them with a video tailored to YOUR question. With charts! #stocks
1222 2018-02-22 20:02:36 Yeah, he’s been open to talking about banning bump stocks and better more comprehensive background checks. Idk about getting ARs banned altogether though
1223 2018-02-22 20:02:21 I’m not saying your overall viewpoint is wrong. Like I said, I don’t like bump stocks. Precisely because I foresaw something like Vegas happening. But I DO NOT trust the government to regulate these devices and others while not abusing their authority.
1224 2018-02-22 20:02:13 You can do this: 14 day wait period. No sale by private owners or gun shows. 10 rounds magazine limit. No bump stocks. Licenses for all arms.  Min age purchase at 21. Assault weapons ban. Universal background check.  Domestic violence ban. 
1225 2018-02-22 20:02:08 Fortunately, the President agrees with you.  Also in favor of banning bump stocks and strengthening background checks.  Yes, AR-15s should also be banned.  However, we can still address school security while that is being debated.
1226 2018-02-22 20:02:04 TRUMP asked; "Y do we need Bump Stocks."
I ask; Y do We need $20+ TRILLION in National Public Debt & who's going to pay for it?
1227 2018-02-22 20:02:03 95% of the American population is good with banning bump stocks and semi automatic weapons THE NRA is not! This would be taxation WITHOUT representation ! Is there a boat in the harbor full of semi auto weapons? We need a dumping! No? VOTE BLUE, LETS GET THESE BUMBS OUT IF HERE
1228 2018-02-22 20:02:01 $MJOG POWER HOUR!!! @stockpicklist #growth #Stocks #GETSOME
1229 2018-02-22 20:01:54 in the 80's people bought penny stocks...today they buy penny crypto...nothing really changes.
1230 2018-02-22 20:01:43 But guns and bump stocks are explicitly made for the purpose of killing. Computers, cars, social media, pencils, knives, etc are not
1231 2018-02-22 20:01:35 They're gonna absolutely pound stocks into the close.
1232 2018-02-22 20:01:32 There's nothing wrong with bump stocks. You have been given bad advice.
1233 2018-02-22 20:01:27 You are being willfully obtuse. I don’t need you to mansplain to me what a bump stock is.  There are existing laws at the state level that have defined and banned bump stocks, but don’t seem to have captured anyone with bionic fingers. We can start with those.
1234 2018-02-22 20:01:16 Buried the lede. Mark May now analyzing stocks for Citi. Now THAT'S a story I want to read.
1235 2018-02-22 20:01:13 At least the Tsys complex is doing what it is supposed to do - catch a bid when stocks slide. Maybe the market isn't completely broken........................
1236 2018-02-22 20:01:13 We like to buy stocks which we feel are undervalued and then we have to have the guts to buy more when they go down. -- Walter Schloss
1237 2018-02-22 20:00:58 im made of flour and sadness too
1238 2018-02-22 20:00:54 But I'm pretty sure a bump stock accessory would make it much easier and more reliable.  Did you see the video of the Vegas shooting?  That was pretty much an advertisement for bump stocks...reliable and effective.
1239 2018-02-22 20:00:45 Mr. Pres this won’t help. The leftist want it all. You give them an inch and they want a mile. Background checks ok bump stocks no.
1240 2018-02-22 20:00:42 How about until we are able to have stronger background checks, a ban on bump stocks and a better ability to identify mental illness we just have a moratorium on the sale of assault type weapons.
1241 2018-02-22 20:00:36 Get what done? NRA agreed with Bump-Stock restriction. Very brave to say those stocks should be banned. How about a POTUS move to ban assault rifles. Now that would be brave.
1242 2018-02-22 20:00:35 The President says he wants to raise the age to buy a firearm to 21. He also said he wants to eliminate the sale of Bump Stocks. He must need a lesson on Rights v Privileges. Enforcement did fail. Enforcement is reactive. I’d rather be proactive.
1243 2018-02-22 20:00:34 dude told me he's against gun control and we shouldn't take people's AR-15's and bump stocks away because "they have a lot of money invested in them. "I'm weary, I had to walk away. #smh
1244 2018-02-22 20:00:26 Bump Stocks not highly controlled.
1245 2018-02-22 20:00:25 My office now stocks grapefruit La Croix just for me and this is how I know I am moving up in the world.
1246 2018-02-22 20:00:00 background checks are fine, but we need some nuance

The age limits seem irrational, have an argument for or against?

Bump stocks should not be banned just like automatics aren't banned. Misnomer. I would support them being regulated under the same rules as automatic weapons.
1247 2018-02-22 19:59:53 President Trump, please reconsider bp stocks. And raising the gun sales to 21? Our young men fight and die for our Country at 18 years oldNo gun control can or will stop evil Only good people with guns can Mental health? Be careful please! Dems do not want Veterans to own guns.
1248 2018-02-22 19:59:44 This is a very complex topic. I wonder If people wouldn't  invest anymore in gun company stocks, does the slaughters would stop?
1249 2018-02-22 19:59:38 what happened to stocks. everyone was so excited this morning 
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1250 2018-02-22 19:59:33 Why then is it the NRA not the media that have blocked universal background checks, any federal money being used to study gun violence, banning of bump stocks & AR -15s? It is not the Media but the NRA and the Congress they have controlled for 7 yrs. Your lies won’t make it true!
1251 2018-02-22 19:59:30 Last, fix our mental health problems. Leave guns alone, leave bump stocks alone and 18 year old law abiding citizens voted for you so they are smart enough to obey the law. But, they can't protect themselves with a gun if you change the age to 21. Bump stocks ain't the problem.
1252 2018-02-22 19:59:14 Unusual but I'm guessing that they withheld names of a few stocks they were building positions in at the relevant times. For instance I think 2 of the 'undisclosed' were GE and Allergan, positions they added in 4Q.
1253 2018-02-22 19:59:09 Oil ends higher after surprise drop in crude stocks
1254 2018-02-22 19:59:09 Penny stocks yu jus gota pay attention .
1255 2018-02-22 19:59:07 THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.

IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE? 
CHILD OR ADULT?
THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!!
IS IT???
1256 2018-02-22 19:59:03 Trump said ban on bump stocks today. But wait an hour....
1257 2018-02-22 19:58:47 なにするわけでもなくセットリスト組むの楽しすぎる
1258 2018-02-22 19:58:42 @lookner Semi-automatic weapons can be fired just as fast as automatics by some people (without Bump Stocks).  Where will the second amendment infringement end?

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS
#GunReformNow #BumpStockBan #GunControl
1259 2018-02-22 19:58:40 If the right thing is by any means necessary OTHER than removing any fire arm, background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the legal age to 21, than yea they're all for the right thing.
1260 2018-02-22 19:58:39 @POTUS  Does Comprehensive = Universal? If not Y evidence are u using to validate that leadership response? Bump Stocks = Las Vegas Slaughter...not a school!  The common denominator in all massive death incidents is not location it's the instrument delivering the human choice.
1261 2018-02-22 19:58:31 The president of the NRA lives in my town and he has made a small fortune selling firearms and other accessories including bump stocks. He has a personal motive to keep as much shit legal as possible from a profit standpoint.
1262 2018-02-22 19:58:07 Pensions are a thing of your generation... They rarely exist anymore.  People are not taught how compounding interest works, how to invest in your future, or even how and why to buy stocks.  If we did teach it, we wouldn't need Social Security or welfare.  I'm retiring by 55...
1263 2018-02-22 19:58:02 Your music is life and it like Apples  stocks@wizkidayo
1264 2018-02-22 19:57:54 we don't trade TSX stocks ..... take a look at $ECN.TO   

Mr Hair club for men,  moved back to leasing (and Toronto) and  this time w/construction hardware
1265 2018-02-22 19:57:44 This is all we need to do to act against school shootings.  Raising the gun purchase age and banning bump stocks isn't necessary.
1266 2018-02-22 19:57:22 You know he really loves mass shootings? Gun manufacturers... go check out how their stocks are doing
1267 2018-02-22 19:57:20 If stocks like PZOO run on dogshit news, then nobody should doubt a company like GGMediaNetwork could see it's PPS back over .01+. I will make sure to come back and say something to the trip zero sellers once we finally get there. It will happen, at one point in time. GL! $AMLH
1268 2018-02-22 19:56:59 OK, so now the brief USD/stocks correlation has broken down too. IS NOTHING SACRED?!?!
1269 2018-02-22 19:56:51 Funny, there’s nothing in the second amendment that says you have a right to bump stocks.
1270 2018-02-22 19:56:47 If you take away bump@stocks and rapid fire, make sure you get voter ID. Both are in the constitution. We need valid proof of ID and citizenship to vote. Honor policy does not work.
1271 2018-02-22 19:56:45 The Las Vegas shooter was 64. Better raise the age to 70. Bump stocks were not used in any school shootings.
1272 2018-02-22 19:56:39 In the comments you said the NRA wouldn't let the ban of bump stocks occur but they were banned prior to Obama
1273 2018-02-22 19:56:06 It's a basic, versatile, starter hunting rifle, with some cosmetic stuff to make it look "cool-ish".

I'm good with banning bump-stocks. Not a problem.
1274 2018-02-22 19:55:46 Mental illness and bump stocks are not the problem.  Bumpstocks do not shoot bullets. AR15's shoot bullets.  Get rid of the AR15's now and forever.
1275 2018-02-22 19:55:39 1) A membership costs $35 a year; 2) NRA membership declines every year because they DON'T represent the views of most gun owners and 3) the constitution doesn't guarantee anyone the right to an AR-15, bump stocks, etc. My kid's life > your gun fetish
1276 2018-02-22 19:55:19 That’s funny he Appoved BUMP STOCKS back in 2010.
1277 2018-02-22 19:55:19 You're right. bump stocks and age change does absolutely nothing to quickly help the issue or help it at all. Out of all the federal institutions the FBI is one of the least trustworthy right now. The incompetence is staggering. You should not trust the FBI.
1278 2018-02-22 19:55:14 Please use your pulpit to encourage the president to drop the idea of a gun registry that will be the beginning of the end, bump stocks are trash so who cares, but a registry..no way.
1279 2018-02-22 19:55:14 you claim to be a Christian, but need your bump stock? You are not Christian nor Pro-Life. Your need for bump stocks makes me want to suggest your name for a watch list.  Stay away from our children.
1280 2018-02-22 19:55:14 Docs and stocks all 2018
1281 2018-02-22 19:55:11 How are bump stocks worse than AR-15s? If they aren’t, why not ban both?
1282 2018-02-22 19:54:40 To really keep our kids safe and save $$, raise the age limit to 21, ban assault rifles and bump stocks, require background checks on all gun purchases, implement waiting periods. It worked before, it'll work again. Sorry NRA. trump just keeps winking at them.
1283 2018-02-22 19:54:28 Ahhhhhh nope!  They've been around for a looooong time for stocks!  Regulated and US based... Not a new organization
1284 2018-02-22 19:54:27 You raised a good point in respect of stocks. Tokens are in fierce fight with stocks recently.
1285 2018-02-22 19:54:25 If he was a smart as Nixon, possibly. But as it is - I firmly expect him to cave to the NRA's demands, denying he ever called for banning bump stocks or sales of rifles to people under 21.
1286 2018-02-22 19:54:23 If they want to do the right thing then:
>Ban auto weapons w/o a permit;
>ban lg qty ammo purchases w/o a permit;
>ban bump stocks;
>if you can't fly, forfeit all your guns;
>if convicted of domestic violence or PO vio or crime ag animals, forfeit all your guns.
THAT'S A START.
1287 2018-02-22 19:54:14 She really caused a billion dollar company stocks to down this is crazy
1288 2018-02-22 19:54:05 So if we banned bump stocks, that would be your last complaint? Everything would be good moving forward after that?
1289 2018-02-22 19:53:46 1. Stricter UNIVERSAL background checks

2. Banning bump stocks

3. Provisions to insure the mentally incompetent can’t own

4. Gun violence restraining orders

5. Special permits to own automatic and assault rifles

6. Mandatory safety training for owners of #5
1290 2018-02-22 19:53:38 I am in support of the ban of bump stocks. Why do you need a modification that mimics something banned 30 years ago?
1291 2018-02-22 19:53:17 How will raising the age to 21 help with the mass shooters that used semi automatic rifles like the Vegas shooter who was 64 years old and Sandy Hook shooter who was 26 years old? There needs to be a mandatory waiting period when buying ANY gun!  Ban assault rifles & bump stocks!
1292 2018-02-22 19:53:11 Umm Obama legalized bump stocks but I guess we just won't mention that
1293 2018-02-22 19:53:03 Same administration that sold guns to Mexican cartels, attempted to cover up Benghazi, gave billions of $’s to Iran, allowed the sale & attempted cover up of uranium to be sold to Russia! U know the country u libs are all shitting cats over! AND they legalized bumpfire stocks!
1294 2018-02-22 19:52:58 Cmon Anna..I’m a proud gun owner and many of my friends are as well.. all of them agree with getting rid of bump stocks along with raising the age and stiffer background checks.If you lost someone you loved to some nut that had a bump stock on their AR you would feel differently
1295 2018-02-22 19:52:56 It's only $8 worth of penny stocks but when I get an email confirmation from @RobinhoodApp telling me "Your Order Has Been Executed" I feel that flush of raw capitalistic power.
1296 2018-02-22 19:52:51 Universal background checks, elimination of bump stocks, requiring registration of all gun sales, the ability to remove guns from people on the FBI watch list, limited magazines, and not allowing people to use guns that can fire 150 rounds in 5 minutes, & much more. Common sense
1297 2018-02-22 19:52:42 Lots of gun owners in my family they agree up the age screen better No AR no bump stocks.  Must b trumps base at this horrible insensitive NRA meeting
1298 2018-02-22 19:52:23 Nothing less than universal background checks, no bump stocks and #NoWeaponsOfWar
1299 2018-02-22 19:52:21 Lol you like my boyfriend he stocks the mailman UPS he starts calling everyone he even made fun of me yesterday like you never check on your orders your like “it will get here when it gets here” 
1300 2018-02-22 19:52:21 Agreed, and I was a gun owner, concealed permit person. I get tired of these people that think we (Dems) are saying no more guns. No more bump stocks, no more assault rifles. Yes to stronger background checks, training and testing.
1301 2018-02-22 19:52:11 Nice move in CHK but i don't add stocks which downtrending to the PEG watchlist.... I like to see an uptrend if not at least a long sideways basing period
1302 2018-02-22 19:51:47 Bad analogy:
1. Dramatically different levels of demand for pot/booze v. bump stocks
2. The intoxicants in demand are designed to produce voluntary effects on consumer. Bump stocks are designed to inflict involuntary damage on others.
1303 2018-02-22 19:51:41 Hey Barry, what's this "we" bullshit you're tweeting. Did you ever even once ask Congress to ban bump stocks? You had eight years to help students be safe. What did you do?
1304 2018-02-22 19:51:30 You did nothing but allow bump stocks. Thank God you are no longer in office.
1305 2018-02-22 19:51:10 Banning of bump stocks. Maybe more. I’d like someone to look at all types of guns and determine which is the most dangerous types of guns that are more than needed for protection or hunting and put serious restrictions on the others. I’d like stronger background checks.
1306 2018-02-22 19:51:09 U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday, putting major indexes on track to snap a recent spate of declines, buoyed by gains in industrial and energy shares as U.S. Treasury yields eased.
1307 2018-02-22 19:51:09 Calls to ban guns really bump stocks #nra
1308 2018-02-22 19:51:04 Trying to trade traditional stocks on the Robinhood app a long time ago helped push me heavy into learning about btc, bc I could see I wouldn't win in stocks like I could in crypto
1309 2018-02-22 19:50:57 Since the ATF & DoJ have said they don't have the legislative authority to ban bump stocks or other similar devices, Donald's response is literally to paper over the problem.
1310 2018-02-22 19:50:24 He didn’t have fully auto weapons. He had semi-auto weapons illegally modified into auto and bump stocks to simulate auto. Fully auto weapons are virtually impossible to get.
1311 2018-02-22 19:50:23 There’s no need for more gun policy.  Ban bump stocks yes.  What’s in place needs enforced.  More money needs to be allocated to mental health and teaching our video game desensitized youth the value of human life.  These people they are killing don’t respawn somewhere else.
1312 2018-02-22 19:50:20 No, they are afraid of the slippery slope and will push back on any new laws. Conservatives in the center need to be heard.  We want common sense reforms like raising the age, bannning bump stocks and yes I would like ARs gone but will take what’s offered now
1313 2018-02-22 19:50:09 Yeah and Trump just announced a ban to bump stocks, and a push to raise age to buy weapons to 21, and stricter background checks with emphasis on mental health. Your President is doing that for you, so I hope you're grateful. But that still doesn't make ur kids safe from psychos
1314 2018-02-22 19:49:50 It isn't 1787 anymore. This was written at a time when militias were needed to protect the US. I'm a proud owner of many firearms, and have no problem outlawing bump stocks and making it difficult to get your hands on a semi-automatic weapon. It's 2018 not 1818.
1315 2018-02-22 19:49:26 If bump stocks are legal, why aren't sawed off shot guns?
1316 2018-02-22 19:49:12 Stocks cautious ahead of Europe debt plan
1317 2018-02-22 19:49:10 I would start with more thorough background checks including required psychological exams that have to be renewed, banning bump stocks, and limiting high capacity magazines more thoroughly.
1318 2018-02-22 19:49:08 No more age restrictions and bump stocks mean nothing. You have an opportunity to really stand up for your base by fixing NICS and addressing mental health without restricting the freedoms of good healthy people. Don’t mess this up.
1319 2018-02-22 19:49:08 Kev man, cut him some slack. He is considering banning assault rifles stocks. If Don was an Alcoholic councillor he’d advise sticking to beer and wine, “just lay off the whisky”.
1320 2018-02-22 19:49:03 Not is a bump stock required to make the weapon function this way. I could pull my rifle down off the wall and shoot it “full auto” simply by holding it a certain way. Anybody can do it. Look it up on YouTube. While I don’t like bump stocks, they aren’t the problem.
1321 2018-02-22 19:49:01 And ATF has said in past it doesn’t have authority to regulate bump stocks.
1322 2018-02-22 19:48:55 Mr. President, changing the age from 18 to 21 ain't gonna stop Mass Murders! Banning bump stocks ain't gonna stop Mass Murders! More gun laws ain't gonna stop Mass Murders! Please stop fucking with our rights that our founders gave us through the constitution. You must protect it
1323 2018-02-22 19:48:54 I like that this morning @realDonaldTrump was like ‘hey maybe we need to ban Bump Stocks’ and the @NRA CLEARLY sat his ass down.
‘I meant it’s violent video games. Definitely video games.’
1324 2018-02-22 19:48:51 Your Just another bit of eye candy used to keep older white men buying boner pills and investing in your idiot rant-filled videos .And increasing big pharm stocks by buying boner pills.

“Believe me, everyone says so”

“ all the soiled dirty old men agree”
1325 2018-02-22 19:48:47 Bump stocks are our ONLY defense against a tyrannical government with automatic weapons.
1326 2018-02-22 19:48:39 Automatic guns are still illegal. Bump stocks increase the rate of fire, but don’t make the gun automatic. 

You’re speaking of an accessory, and Most people don’t even have a problem getting rid of bump stocks, we just KNOW it doesn’t end there. Some Ppl just want guns banned.
1327 2018-02-22 19:48:29 Flexibility Exercise #2!
Dance: Stretching before AND after an exercise is imperative to allow your muscles to become flexible!
Finance: Investing in a variety of stocks gives you a flexible portfolio that can still be successful, even if one of your holding is underperforming!
1328 2018-02-22 19:48:26 I too, dislike #Snapchat’s new update (watch stocks rise now)
1329 2018-02-22 19:48:00 true that!...lets go to that .02...
1330 2018-02-22 19:47:58 Je scrute le site depuis 3 semaines, pas de dispo à - de 100€. Une commande passée et annulée qlqs heures après car finalement pas de dispo. Départ demain donc là c'est trop tard, tant pis ! Problèmes de gestion de stocks ou mauvais fournisseurs, bref, décevant !
1331 2018-02-22 19:47:50 I don't think that's what this story says at all -- it points out that teachers' retirement accounts are invested in these stocks. I think many teachers might not realize that and might have a problem with it.
1332 2018-02-22 19:47:48 amazons stocks are down maybe if they would CHARGE my account and SHIP my items i could help em out a bit.......................
1333 2018-02-22 19:47:48 Uh-oh. Contrarians: to the bunkers! Tomorrow taxi drivers will be buying stocks. @PaulGambles2
1334 2018-02-22 19:47:46 the 2nd amendment doesn’t guarantee ur right to own BUMP STOCKS lmaoooo
1335 2018-02-22 19:47:42 What's wrong with bump stocks tho
1336 2018-02-22 19:47:40 Where in the constitution does it say we cant have bump stocks? Being as you brought it up and all
1337 2018-02-22 19:47:38 The most infuriating thing about the bump stocks proposal is the fact the issue got buried after what happened in Las Vegas, and that it took several more mass shootings and a bunch of angry teens to make them finally listen about that issue. #PressBriefing
1338 2018-02-22 19:47:23 Wait he signed a Memorandum on Bum stocks? A memorandum? That mental health ban was a Executive order that he CHOSE to roll back? This is the best he can do?! NRA is still in his thoughts and prayers! #WHBreifing
1339 2018-02-22 19:47:08 アホだから曲流して自刃にござるってやつやってて眠れない
1340 2018-02-22 19:46:51 This is throwing a BS bone!!!!!!!! Getting rid of Bump Stocks will not stop mass shootings. Not in Schools nor anywhere else!!!!!!!! Guns that can fire multiple rounds in a minute killing dozens can still be used. You need to go after the actual guns!!!!! YOU KNOW THIS!!!!!!!
1341 2018-02-22 19:46:49 Asked about executive actions Trump will take on guns, @RajShah45 brings up the memo Trump signed on bump stocks. "That's it?" a reporter asks. "Yeah," Raj responds.
1342 2018-02-22 19:46:46 And maybe they think there's a good reason to own the stock -- there are arguments for and against divestment. But screening out gun stocks isn't a particularly novel concept.
1343 2018-02-22 19:46:41 Banning bump stocks is a waste of time... All you need to make your own is some rubber bands...
1344 2018-02-22 19:46:26 To draw "Bump Stocks" into the debate is just muddying the waters, @RajShah45. @WhiteHouse #PressBriefing #MAGA #CNN #TheLead #FoxAndFriends
1345 2018-02-22 19:46:23 Of course you don’t. The policy changes (better background checks, raising legal age, ban bump stocks) are low hanging fruit. Those should have been enacted 10 shootings ago. No one needs an assault rifle.
1346 2018-02-22 19:46:18 Q: Will #Trump do anything at the executive level? Like an EO?

#Shah: He already has. He’s ordered the DOJ to increase their review on bump stocks.

That’s not actually doing anything, bro.

#WHBriefing
1347 2018-02-22 19:45:39 Why is the FIRST thing D'wight Peeper who live and swear by their guns want to bring up is Chicago? You see 600 folks gettin' mulled down with bump stocks in South Chicago? It gets on my LAST nerve. BYE!
1348 2018-02-22 19:45:16 Dems and Antifa call us fascists for awhile now.  And now democrats and you are calling for gun control????   Yes, get rid of bump stocks.  Yes, mental illness checks. NO ban for any semi auto AR style. Media hysteria. Where r pro gun dem voters? There are many media ignores.
1349 2018-02-22 19:45:12 perfect time to add to one's positions during this pullback. Pretty much everything down today across the board, so thats when you buy the quality stocks and hang on.
1350 2018-02-22 19:45:11 Bump stocks are not illegal. So the "semi-automatic" card that every gun supporter uses is not valid.
1351 2018-02-22 19:45:11 BIM STOCKS
1352 2018-02-22 19:44:57 "Wayne LaPierre" Trump, On his failed listening tour, where his cribsheet has to say "I HEAR YOU" because he doesnt, actually said Teachers will be armed! Bump stocks outlawed, and background checks too!After 71 Years of Pathological Lying, I dont believe a word! Will Trump Act?
1353 2018-02-22 19:44:49 YESSSSSS  my stocks went up like crazy today
1354 2018-02-22 19:44:41 Awesome (: but always be on the lookout for other stocks dont get stuck on one
1355 2018-02-22 19:44:20 Its in his interest for a #recession as he has approx. $20B on shorting #European #stocks. 

Hint: #Italy is not happy!
1356 2018-02-22 19:44:19 @realDonaldTrump i support you strengthening background checks and banning bump stocks as well as armed guards at schools but also get national reciprocity for CCW holders!
1357 2018-02-22 19:44:06 Well his reply was into something I didn’t say. We can start a whole new conversation about gun laws, but when the thread is about bump stocks and you reply as though it’s about a gun it makes it hard to continue the convo since it doesn’t make any sense. Lol 
1358 2018-02-22 19:44:00 Yep our forefathers wanted bump stocks for all!
1359 2018-02-22 19:43:55 Your right as a well formed militia, right? Cuz if you aren’t part of a militia that right does not apply to you. And you have the right to defend yourself, not to use bump stocks.
1360 2018-02-22 19:43:54 Agreed, ppl with mental health issues shouldn’t have guns. Bump stocks aren’t a prob if there’s nothing to put them on.

@Papa_Stocks
1362 2018-02-22 19:43:48 If they want to do the right thing then they should be more than willing to ban assault rifles/guns, strengthen back ground checks, ban bump stocks and raise minimum age one can get a license to carry a gun.

1364 2018-02-22 19:43:12 A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

I am sorry.. where is the part about the right to have bump stocks? (you know, a thing that didn't even exist when this was written?)
1365 2018-02-22 19:43:02 HOW MUCH FIREPOWER DO YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY? Do you need an automatic weapon? Bump stocks? Silencers? Military grade weapons?
1366 2018-02-22 19:43:00 $LDSR 0.0140 looks ready to next leg IMO!
1367 2018-02-22 19:42:56 ending the sale of bump stocks will do nothing Mr President. If you gave anti gun grabbers an inch they will take a mile
1368 2018-02-22 19:42:41 BTW the only time bump-stocks were used in a mass shooting ICYMI was #LasVegasShooting THAT happened during #Dotard admin. As u know @GOP has control of House, Senate AND @WhiteHouse I havent seen them putting forward any laws to ban bump-stocks, have u? Is @POTUS44 still pres?
1369 2018-02-22 19:42:33 None of them as of now since I don't hold any stocks through earnings however I watched with great intent since I add and delete names constantly to the AOT  Power Earnings Gap(PEG) watch list. 

FSLR and OLED have been on the PEG watch list for a few months now!
1370 2018-02-22 19:42:22 Also AR-15s aren’t assault rifles. They only seem like them with bump stocks which the right are trying to outlaw. Why do you try to argue anything when your “facts” aren’t even factual?
1371 2018-02-22 19:42:19 Autos are heavily regulated and I could only  find reference to an auto being used in 3 criminal acts since 1934, but okay, solve a problem that does not exist.  The benefit of bump stocks can be recreated using a belt loop.  Should belt loops be banned also?
1372 2018-02-22 19:42:17 Hey thanks for the reply
$MJOG is alittle on the low side i usually stick with stocks above .50  less than 40.00
Alittle to volatile for me
1373 2018-02-22 19:42:04 I gave some healthy bits about giving uranium stocks to a supposed "enemy" & hopefully a few ppl understand dems & repubs are the same shark. I jus can't stand "liberal" dems sticking up for Hillary. She isn't liberal & def not the progressive we need
1374 2018-02-22 19:41:08 Sounds good, as long as the Deep State or the military don't use BUMP stocks either. What's good for the goose...
1375 2018-02-22 19:41:03 Hiya Mike. What $4 attachment? Bump stocks start at about $200. 
Dimocrats don't care about the people. Dims have zero ideas or leadership abilities. 
Best to listen to the words of wisdom from @POTUS .  Natural born leader right there.
1376 2018-02-22 19:40:24 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1377 2018-02-22 19:40:24 Dude I stop playing penny stocks while ago, I fed up with plays everyday. Penny stocks are temporary
1378 2018-02-22 19:40:20 Trump is taking some common sense steps to reduce mass shootings.

Obama had both houses of Congress the first 2 years of his term, including 60 Dems in the Senate & managed only to legalize bump stocks
1379 2018-02-22 19:40:15 Regulating bump stocks is not gun control. It’s bump stock control.
1380 2018-02-22 19:40:12 What's a bump stock? Oh, and ban bump stocks!
1381 2018-02-22 19:40:09 Trump is impulsive and doesn’t follow through with half the shit he promises to do. When he spews all that talk about banning bump stocks he is just bluffing. It won’t get done.
1382 2018-02-22 19:39:56 This conversation about bump stocks should have taken place 3 months ago! This is drumpf "appeasing" the #NeverAgain movement's insatiable appetite for change. We can't let them stop with this! #AssaultWeaponsBan is the goal! & it Has to happen NOW!
1383 2018-02-22 19:39:40 Now I'm totally okay banning bump fire stocks (I'm not sure how the ATF  allowed them in the first place) but a lot of rifle things they are trying to ban have zero effect on the potential damage a gun can cause in the wrong hands.
1384 2018-02-22 19:39:18 Right, Im completely with you. Bump stocks exploit the law to make semi-auto's functionally automatic. Of course we should ban them
1385 2018-02-22 19:39:05 Remember that when stocks fall, people's pensions get fucked too
1386 2018-02-22 19:39:00 Enough with anti-american canadians determining what USA stands for. If the gov has assault rifles, then citizens need them too. Period. That's America, get over it. Prescription medicine plays a big part in this as do bump stocks with mass shootings.
1387 2018-02-22 19:38:45 Remember:

Bump stocks were approved for use in 2010 - under the Obama administration. It wasn’t Republicans, but Democrats, that approved them.
1388 2018-02-22 19:38:44 I was merely having a discussion with you guys for learning and view point sake. I have tiny stocks in BTC, ETH and IOTA, I just find the tech behind all of them interesting and believe that each one has their place in the world.
1389 2018-02-22 19:38:35 UPDATE 7-Oil prices rise after unexpected drawdown in U.S. crude stocks #energy #oil
1390 2018-02-22 19:38:21 Why? Bump stocks had nothing to do with this shooting. You're just eroding the 2nd amendment. Do you want to lose in 2020?
1391 2018-02-22 19:38:18 and there will be stricter background checks and no bump stocks.
1392 2018-02-22 19:38:06 Why are bump stocks even legal
1393 2018-02-22 19:37:42 Did you miss the part where he’s trying to make background checks more thorough especially in regards to mental health and trying to ban bump stocks? 
1394 2018-02-22 19:37:33 Well then some good stocks will be cheaper to get into.
1395 2018-02-22 19:37:22 Great quote. Wonder if Ben would have had a philosophy change if he was around AR's, bump stocks, nuclear weapons and mass casualty events.
1396 2018-02-22 19:37:18 Its crypto. High volatility and it never closes like Stocks do
1397 2018-02-22 19:37:15 Bump Stocks, extensive background checks, gun show loopholes,raising the age to buy a guns ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO PLACE.

Don’t play into their game and give them credit for something that should have been done already.

BAN ASSAULT RIFLES. 
START THERE
1398 2018-02-22 19:37:00 Corporations are using their tax cut money to buy back stocks and drive up share prices to enrich company execs. Falsely inflates share prices. They are also using tax cuts to lay off workers. Relatively little is going to wages. Were we duped? Bigly! #resist #GOPTaxScam
1399 2018-02-22 19:36:55 Nothing would happen ti Turkish economy;
1)qatar and some other arabs petro dollars
2)depth/gdp is 40/100
3)main problem is in the west
4)theres nowhere to invest
5)nothing left to buy in western stocks
6)russia and china are ready to stand back
1400 2018-02-22 19:36:47 Good for you sir. There are a lot of Democrats attacking the kid who shared "GOP ATTACKS SURVIVORS!" memes yesterday. It's good to know there's one consistent person in the debate, though of course now you've got to agree with Trump ab raising the age limit/bump stocks. G'luck.
1401 2018-02-22 19:35:59 Actions NOT words! You signed legislation that mad or easier for ppl with mental illness to get guns. You've consistently chosen a path that has made it easier not harder to get guns! After LV you had an opportunity to bam bump stocks and you did nothing! Talk is cheap!
1402 2018-02-22 19:35:53 @em_stocks happy birthday u beauty!! hope u have had the best day!
1403 2018-02-22 19:35:52 Taxpayer money is not paying for bump stocks, tax payer money is paying for your mistake, I mean abortion.
1404 2018-02-22 19:35:45 You can 3d PRINT GUNS and BUMP STOCKS- - - This is all a dumb argument.
1405 2018-02-22 19:35:30 Banning AR15s & bump stocks would be a good step. An armed guard couldn't stop the shooter at Parkland.  Crossfire in classrooms would create even more casualties. Teachers want to teach, they don't want to be trained snipers. 2/2
1406 2018-02-22 19:35:30 Yes. The dravidians pre-date the Aryans by 10000s years. 
The features evolved far in the north caspian & subcontinent stocks. In period far longer by many times than the 3700yrs, that made possible the evolution.
1407 2018-02-22 19:35:26 I agree w everything except bump stocks. Bump stocks would start a slippery slope and bump stocks didn't kill ppl, people did.
1408 2018-02-22 19:34:54 Seen a few headlines that Trump’s gun proposals may “dire ire” from the NRA...

Bitch wants to arm 20% of teachers with government purchased firearms!! I’m pretty sure the trade group representing firearms manufacturers (NRA) will gladly trade bump stocks for gun socialism
1409 2018-02-22 19:34:38 Ending the sale of bump stocks might sound like a great move. It’s a pointless toothless tiger. It will only satisfy the illiterate.
1410 2018-02-22 19:34:38 i AGREE,,,just making some stupid push against bum stocks...never heard of them before LV...not the issue..
1411 2018-02-22 19:34:24 I'm so lucky I'm scheduled March. Who knows that 1 hour live session with the best trader is my turning point in stocks trading. God bless you @BOOMIEtrader ....
1412 2018-02-22 19:34:16 Understand that bump stocks make guns almost full auto, that makes them extremely dangerous, you don’t need them to hunt or defend your home. They’re unnecessary and are used for killing people at this point
1413 2018-02-22 19:34:10 We need to protect Americans by passing the #GVRO Act, banning bump stocks, expanding background checks, and preventing domestic abusers from obtaining deadly firearms.
1414 2018-02-22 19:33:49 I just watched Maddow break this down, and he needs to tell Congress, which he controls, to pass legislation banning accessories like bump stocks. Sen. Feinstein authored something like this in 2013, I believe, but it didn't pass. He's full of shit.
1415 2018-02-22 19:33:38 Hahahaha! Let’s stop treating the mentally ill and let them have bump stocks!
1416 2018-02-22 19:33:24 not all guns - although the sale of Bump Stocks and semi-automatic rifles should be ban!
1417 2018-02-22 19:33:08 How many working class citizens hold big Corp stocks in their 401k?
1418 2018-02-22 19:33:07 Not only would at least a large minority of the military fight with the American people if that happened (if not most) - you can bet your life that people all across the country would start home-manufacturing bump stocks, 3D printed guns and the like.

1420 2018-02-22 19:32:09 Know your subject matter:  by AWR HAWKINS4 Oct 20172While bump stocks are taking criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike, it is interesting to note that the devices were approved for sale in 2010 by Barack Obama’s ATF.
1421 2018-02-22 19:32:07 I own AR15. I don't think it unreasonable to nan high cap mags and bump stocks. How does that violate the constitution?
1422 2018-02-22 19:31:53 THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.

IS IT???
1423 2018-02-22 19:31:42 Most of the schools districts here have been dealing with gun threats for the last few days; social media & verbal threats.  Several teens have been arrested and some schools are on lock down. This is horrifying. We cannot take background checks and banning of bump-stocks.
1424 2018-02-22 19:31:40 @realDonaldTrump was very supportive of the NRA today. Now trump thinks it’s a good idea to ban bump stocks but not assault weapons? I’m w u Adam - time for @GOP to put up or step aside. #BlueTsunami #NeverAgainMSD #GunControl #WorstPresidentEver
1425 2018-02-22 19:31:06 @cnnbrk @CBSNews @NBCNews @SNLUpdate  If you can ban bump stocks, you can ban high capacity automatic guns such as the AR-15, or the AK-47, etc.  We have the right to bear arms, but when they become too dangerous for “We The People”, banning such weapons becomes a priority.
1426 2018-02-22 19:31:03 And as they're stocks skyrocket. You'd think educators would have a remedial understand of economics.  Biting the hands that feeds retirement makes for a bad precedent.

1429 2018-02-22 19:30:38 Private civilian ownership of machine guns is illegal unless the individual has been explicitly permitted by the federal ATF to own them. AK's are illegal, too. If you're talking about AR-15's they're hunting rifles w/metal stocks.
1430 2018-02-22 19:30:35 I agree on the mental health however I don’t think the bump stocks should be consider as part of the regulation, because that will be the tip of the Speer to ban a lot more things and ultimately make everything ilegales
1431 2018-02-22 19:30:18 Nowhere in the 2nd amendment does it say anything about protecting gun accessories. Comprises has to made and bump stocks are a waste of ammo anyway.
1432 2018-02-22 19:30:15 @TedNugent uncle ted do u think government will be able to make us turn bump stocks in and give us jail time and fines like New Jersey if we don’t and I read that there trying to say u can’t change trigger how would that stop a sicko from killing people wish they’d use their head
1433 2018-02-22 19:30:15 ...said the man who legalized bump stocks.
1434 2018-02-22 19:30:08 SENSE OVER CENT$! Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! AT NO AGE should ANYONE OTHER THAN MILITARY/SWAT own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES or BUMP STOCKS! Not demanding NO Guns of NRA; but, LIFE should Trump Rt. To Auto-Assault Weapons! Employ Common Sense!

- extreme bullet tax
- ID & background checks req’d
- federal age to purchase any firearm at least 21.

1439 2018-02-22 19:29:37 Let us know when they get on board with raising the age to buy guns, stricter background checks, banning bump stocks, or any law whatsoever that might limit gun sales.
#WeCallBS
1440 2018-02-22 19:28:56 More people were killed in the vegas massacre than at Hamburger Hill. Why? Cuz of the incredible # of rounds ARs fire, inc by bump stocks, and by the unique damage the ammo these wmds cause. Much diff than reg guns and rifles.
1441 2018-02-22 19:28:52 Also never said semi automatic weapons should be illegal. For this entire thread I have kept my arguments to magazine size, RoF, and bump stocks.

Please stop putting words in my mouth
1442 2018-02-22 19:28:33 Arming teachers is wrong @realDonaldTrump . Expand background checks; 5 day waiting period; require mental health screening; red flag law; ban bump stocks n assault weapons.  Civilians don’t need weapons of war.
1443 2018-02-22 19:28:26 HAHAHAH shows you how impactful she is, that could even affect the company’s stocks omg it’s quite sad tho
1444 2018-02-22 19:28:23 Reminder that in 2007 32 people were murdered at Virginia Tech & no machine guns were used. We need to ban machine guns and bump stocks now. But our problems won’t stop there. No more dead kids smh
1445 2018-02-22 19:28:05 I’m with trump on the background checks and mental health stuff...the bump stocks and age restrictions are pointless.
1446 2018-02-22 19:27:45 $Linu Please hit the $2 please. market is garbage but Tech stocks are holding nicely.
1447 2018-02-22 19:27:21 Maybe ban bump stocks and assault rifles. That would be an excellent start!
1448 2018-02-22 19:27:16 @Liz_Wheeler , I am a @realDonaldTrump  supporter,  @POTUS  can win 2020 - end the sale of Bump Stocks - a sure win for the USA

1451 2018-02-22 19:26:54 How long will Donny remember this proposal? Any bets? 

Before the recent shootings, it was rumored that our Narcissist-in-Chief thought bump stocks were some type of exotic sex toy.

1453 2018-02-22 19:26:44 I’ve seen bump stocks go on general hand guns with the right attachments/accessories, they actually make hand guns better for range shooting and much more fun, so why get rid of them ? They aren’t causation of deaths. sorry not sorry
1454 2018-02-22 19:26:40 They will ban bump stocks and forget about legalizing silencers, maybe require 21 to buy an AR. Other than those half ass token efforts they will do nothing.
1455 2018-02-22 19:26:40 I can't imagine what use bump stocks are for other than killing.  More gun laws.. No. How about mental health care becoming more of a priority. Most of these kids killing kids in school are emotionally damaged. Mental health laws need to be changed.

1457 2018-02-22 19:26:09 Answer the question.  Why do you want bump stocks?
1458 2018-02-22 19:26:07 Stocks in the firearm industry being up have nothing to do with the NRA, it's the economy. The NRA is a non-profit and cannot control the stock market or individual stocks. Let's talk about cooking @TylerFlorence.
1459 2018-02-22 19:25:55 The issue with bump stocks is more about how vague legislation can be abused than it is about having actual bump stocks.
1460 2018-02-22 19:25:48 I cant say I know about bump stocks but i do know machine guns since I owned many as a collector and I doubt they will fire that fast. On the other hand, I have read that it is possible to make most semiautomatic rifles fully automatic,
1461 2018-02-22 19:25:43 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
1462 2018-02-22 19:25:21 Yeah don't do anything significant like banning assault rifles.  Move the age limit to 21 and nobody will pay attention. Eliminate bump stocks but do nothing about conversion kits. I could change a semi auto to a full auto in about 45 minutes. It's so easy even you could do it.

1464 2018-02-22 19:25:17 it usually doesn't tho (unless Trump tweets something crazy lol)

the market overall is generally pretty stable, especially compared to legitimately volatile stuff like Bitcoin for example.

specific stocks in niche fields will always be vulnerable tho, thus...the Kylie effect 
1465 2018-02-22 19:25:12 Stocks & Bonds .
1466 2018-02-22 19:25:02 I agree with the premise but banning bump stocks is not unconstitutional as I see. You are afforded the right to bear arms. Not accessories. Am I missing something?
1467 2018-02-22 19:25:01 sadder thing: "the next school shooter" probably can't be stopped since even with gun control, "the next school shooter" already owns multiple AR-15s with bump stocks

Our best hope is to decrease the incidence of school shootings in a country that fetishizes implements of death
1468 2018-02-22 19:24:52 Guess we won't see you making a responsible decision to vote for banning bump stocks and assault weapons if a bill sneaks past your NRA party onto the floor.  Republican party no longer exists-bought by the NRA-lock, stock, and barrel.
1469 2018-02-22 19:24:35 Most men's Brains not fully developed till 21 or shortly after so yes 21, mental health a definite we don't need bump stocks as long as that's all that's in the legislation.
1470 2018-02-22 19:24:28 Never Trumper constipated Chris Wallace on @HARRISFAULKNER says this can be Trumps finest hour if he bans bump stocks

Bumpstock mot used in school shooting.
Bumpstock USED in Vegas which MSM had dropped completely even tho 58 killed 

Never hear Chris Wallace mention FBI role
1471 2018-02-22 19:24:17 I am about protecting children. I don't want them murdered by guns or aborted. I don't even want to see u have a gun taken away. If u feel uneed a pistol 4 protection in your home, or a riffle. Yet when people are dying bump stocks & semi automatics are not needed Price 2 high.
1472 2018-02-22 19:24:07 I believe there are responsible gun manufactures , the key is to give them a clear no compromise definition of what is allowed and what is barred . No bump stocks no semi auto guns period no bazzokas  no tanks no icbms

1474 2018-02-22 19:23:45 @potus tweeted today-"I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks w/an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21& end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on issue I hope!" This in itself would be more than our last 3 pres. have done.
1475 2018-02-22 19:23:41 this is crap - it's part of a portfolio and they don't pick stocks. Go find a real story
1476 2018-02-22 19:23:32 @realDonaldTrump amazing job on actually acting on bump stocks....one massacre later. Clearly it tricks your pea sized brain into making you think “that’s it, I’ve something no one else has done, and many many many people are saying it” - u joke of a human. #you’reembarrasing
1477 2018-02-22 19:23:30 And that hair. You would think gel and shampoo stocks would have soared.
1478 2018-02-22 19:23:19 @NRA Can you imagine all the 18 yr olds in USA today trying to buy their semi-automatic toy. Gun co.s that NRA represents financially benefit from deaths of young Americans - their stocks up 4.5 %. More deaths greater profits. Talk about "blood money" #ParklandStudentsSpeak
1479 2018-02-22 19:22:59 Please end the sale of Bump Stocks! Tell Congress to get off their asses and do it! NOW!
1480 2018-02-22 19:22:57 It's the NRA profiting from mass shootings. Gun stocks are up, as they usually are after mass shootings. Which means their donors are wealthier. Which means the NRA is getting wealthier. Your job is enabling the deaths of children, @DLoesch. Just vile.
1481 2018-02-22 19:22:52 The surest way to destroy what’s left of the US education system is to arm some teachers. But hey, gun stocks are climbing.
1482 2018-02-22 19:22:51 Unclear what that chart conveys. I  believe it’s shares of total chinese OFDI flows. Perhaps to see effect on Africa, useful to look at stocks, and as flows as share of domestic investment  (1/2).
1483 2018-02-22 19:22:41 Demand national concealed carry reciprosity in exchange for any concessions on bump stocks, raising the age to purchase rifles,z etc.@waynelapierrejr
1484 2018-02-22 19:22:40 @realDonaldTrump Proposing the ban on bump stocks which would not have saved the 17 in Florida, by the way, is a little too late! Proposing arming the teachers is a looney, moon bat idea! Single shot muzzle loading pistols and rifles are what private citizens...
1485 2018-02-22 19:22:15 @HashChain_Tech  why did i buy your stocks again??
1486 2018-02-22 19:22:15 Bump stocks just make a gun less accurate and fire more rounds.
1487 2018-02-22 19:22:11 McConnell Ryan bring something anything to the floor that’s your job bring it to the floor for a vote n the ppl can see a up-down vote on bump stocks banning A.R. 15 rifles bring them to the floor call for a vote n the people can see I CALL BS! U shoved UR TAX MASSACRE no input!!
1488 2018-02-22 19:22:06 President Trump, second amendment is to protect us from a rogue government. Improved background & mental health is okay. Do not restrict bump stocks!
1489 2018-02-22 19:21:41 I always wondered who was the dope who bought these stocks..thanks for putting a face to it..and thanks for the squeeze from Nov til Dec
1490 2018-02-22 19:21:32 Remember when @realDonaldTrump said  U could shoot someone on 5th Ave & still get elected? How bout banning assault weapons,  back round checks & raising gun purchase age and end bump stocks? Think U would still have a shot?  Try it! #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #ParklandStudents #love
1491 2018-02-22 19:20:28 Trump is proposing a bump stock ban. This ban will do NOTHING. Bump stocks don’t make weapons fully automatic, they actually make them less accurate. #bumpstocks #NRA #2ndAmendment
1492 2018-02-22 19:20:03 You have 16 followers.. haha. Learn to trade instead of promoting penny stocks and you will make more than minimum wage.
1493 2018-02-22 19:19:50 Inspiring #ThisGirlCan session delivered at Stocks Green today. So many interesting discussions from the Year 3 girls about the importance of challenging gender stereotypes 
1494 2018-02-22 19:19:26 But at what cost?

Bear with me here...let's try one of those hypotheticals.

WHAT IF...and I really do mean what if...what if there were irrefutable proof that limiting RoF, magazine capacity, and banning bump stocks resulted in fewer school shootings? Would you give them up?
1495 2018-02-22 19:19:21 Your right to own guns is not impeded by removing bump stocks or even military type weapons. The 2nd amendment was created in a time of single shot muskets.
1496 2018-02-22 19:19:14 Automatic weapons have been illegal since prohibition. No law is needed to ban bump stocks and other conversion kits. They are illegal. The ATF needs to enforce the law.
1497 2018-02-22 19:19:11  You overlook the Approaching Revolution! Don’t tell me you are not stockpiling old cabbage leaves, rotten eggs and tomatoes and custard pies? (And no- custard creams will not do!) As I speak, trusty carpenters are constructing the stocks and the gallows! Keep up!
1498 2018-02-22 19:18:36 Bump stocks force your gun to be used in a way it wasn’t intended. When fired so quickly it heats up a lot faster and can damage it if done for long periods of time. I did read about it becusee I thought a bump stock sounded tight.
1499 2018-02-22 19:18:35 It is your right to own a gun.  It does not say what gun and banning bump stocks and assault rifles does not preclude you owning a gun.
1500 2018-02-22 19:18:34 Removing bump stocks IS NOT ENOUGH!!!!! Assault weapons DO NOT belong in civilian hands! Only the police and military personnel!
1501 2018-02-22 19:18:21 Damn there goes the price of bump stocks. Gun manufacturers are loving you. Mean while the average joe is shit on by another politician. Bottom line if you want protection become a (B)millionaire then have other poor souls die for you. #UNTOUCHABLE
1502 2018-02-22 19:17:39 Exactly. Bump stocks should have been made illegal after Las Vegas, but due to the inaction of our Republican controlled Congress nothing happened. But now that future voters are coming out in full force, now they wanna consider this? Lol
1503 2018-02-22 19:17:33 I thought it was a right to bear arms, not a right to bump stocks
1504 2018-02-22 19:17:28 I remember GOP dismantling reqd denial of gun permit to mentally ill. I remember GOP refusing to act on mass domestic terrorism, stating "it's too soon to talk" I remember GOP refusing to address weapons of war after LV, in particular bump-stocks. I remembered on my ballot Tues.
1505 2018-02-22 19:17:27 Mama has self published my books and only sold them from my webpage but Print on Demand is expensive. She can't afford to order large stocks of all of my books. She would love to do more.
1506 2018-02-22 19:17:13 Do the right thing?  The NRA has lobbied against every attempt to ban bump stocks, national registry of weapons, ban of military grade weapons, common sense gun laws, etc., etc. They endorsed only candidates who favor their agenda, and run ADs against those who don't. 1/2
1507 2018-02-22 19:17:08 Over 170,000,000,000 returned to CEOs, Boards and stockholders - and few working families hold stocks. That suggests, actually PROVES 
GOP tax cuts benefited UBER RICH by huge margins. People, voters, talking about it.
1508 2018-02-22 19:16:47 It’s who she is, Charley!
1509 2018-02-22 19:16:36 As of Sunday the NRA stated they supported Trump banning bump stocks. In 2010, under Obama , the sale of bump stocks were permitted for sale.
1510 2018-02-22 19:15:53 #bumpstocks Mr. President there appears to be some question about your ability to ban Bump Stocks by executive order. I don't know if another option has occurred to you, and that's to classify the Bump Stock as a Class 3 weapon attachment. While it doesn't ban them
1511 2018-02-22 19:15:46 Plus, bump stocks are bad for your gun. Why would you use one unless you don’t care about what happens to your AR-15 after the police come and kill you?
1512 2018-02-22 19:15:40 FFS, Vegas was the 1st of October 2017 and we are now nearing 5 months ago. Bump stocks should have been banned on the 2nd of October.  How long did it take the USA to ban Kinder eggs?
1513 2018-02-22 19:15:23 In the right to bear arms. Guns with bump stocks fall under arms.
1514 2018-02-22 19:15:04 @realDonaldTrump President Trump, since you are pushing for regulation of bump stocks, what gun regulations are you going to repeal per your policy on new regulations??  May I suggest H.Amdt.777 to H.R.4332.
1515 2018-02-22 19:14:42 And the ban of bump stocks is a joke too. For one my finger can pull the trigger just as fast, and it will have better accuracy.
1516 2018-02-22 19:14:26 More guns in a school isn’t the answer...I’ll tell you what, take away the secret service and you travel by yourself but let’s keep all the AR-15s legal and bump stocks and see how your dumbazz likes traveling around without protection knowing someone may open season on you.
1517 2018-02-22 19:13:52 Says he is an investigative journalist.  Might want to let him know that investigating more than his personal BS is required to be an investigative journalist.  Might even find out why the stocks rose.  Just saying.
1518 2018-02-22 19:13:49 Mr.Trump,   If you can join the military at 18 you should be allowed to purchase a firearm.   Please add a background check to bump stocks not a ban.  The ban will not do any good...   Crimnals will still get one if they want it.   Common Sense is where it’s at.
1519 2018-02-22 19:13:48 You are wrong on raising the age and bump stocks
1520 2018-02-22 19:13:28 16| Back All of the Companies OWN DAM STOCKS in the Stock Market. The Very Ppl Who Fucked the Hole Dam Shit On Ups.
1521 2018-02-22 19:13:24 Not all ARs can shoot so fast and in such large quantities. Banning sale of large capacity magazines, bump stocks and adding wait times to buy an AR-15 can ONLY do good! And would not limit anyone’s hunting ability.
1522 2018-02-22 19:13:22 The ‘one’ I’d pick would be 6 to 9 stocks
1523 2018-02-22 19:13:21 doesn't the NRA also want to ban bump stocks?
1524 2018-02-22 19:13:21 They love MONEY MORE!
BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND MODIFYING BUMP STOCKS FOR PURCHASE BY CIVILIANS
ALSO NRA UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR CULLUSION/COLLABORATION
WITH RUSSIA...
1525 2018-02-22 19:13:21 If you raise the age to 21 and end bump stocks, how about giving us CCWP reciprocity and silencers? Sounds like a good trade.
1526 2018-02-22 19:13:19 It is more than just gun reform. Yes outlaw bump stocks and raise age limit, but also strengthen background checks, arm trained school employees, harden school access, mental health screening, train teachers, students and parents to warning signs of trouble so they can intervene
1527 2018-02-22 19:13:10 Yes true about health I already gave up long time. I am focus on technology stocks only
1528 2018-02-22 19:12:59 Just for the record the NRA recommended that bump stocks and other similar devices that make a semiauto mimic automatic rifles be more closely regulated by the govt...
1529 2018-02-22 19:12:55 I thought they came out in favor of banning bump stocks after Vegas? Was I hallucinating?
1530 2018-02-22 19:12:48 When the constitution was written, they had no idea how advanced guns would get. Back then it took two minutes just to reload a musket. If the founding fathers had the same technology as we do now then I’m sure that they would be against bump stocks
1531 2018-02-22 19:12:47 I would applaud @realDonaldTrump if he follows thru re bump stocks, background checks, NRA. And/but I remember when he pledged to protect DREAMERs & said he ‘talked to’ the Boy Scouts. Hoping he breaks that mold. #NeverAgain
1532 2018-02-22 19:12:32 Possibly the most ridiculous, yet totally expected, part of all of this is that @realDonaldTrump is acting like he’s been fighting for stricter background checks and no bump-stocks this whole time.
1533 2018-02-22 19:12:31 If the Founding fathers had bump stocks they would use them. "the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed on" - 2nd Amendement
1534 2018-02-22 19:12:21 #Apple busca comprar varias miles de toneladas de #cobalto (esencial para las baterías de litio) directamente de las compañías mineras durante los 5 próximos años, antes de que los productores de coches eléctricos lo agoten.
1535 2018-02-22 19:12:15 Exactly my point  people are still going to make bad choices regardless of the laws. Theyre also increasing background checks placing special emphasis on mental health as well as banning bump stocks.
1536 2018-02-22 19:12:11 There’s literally nowhere that stocks good bikinis
1537 2018-02-22 19:12:02 When did the solution to the problem become “let’s have more of the problem?” Arming teachers isn’t the solution! Access to assault weapons, high capacity magazines, & bump stocks, is the problem. #BanAssaultRifles #bumpstocks #gunviolence must stop NOW! #ThursdayThoughts
1538 2018-02-22 19:11:58 @realDonaldTrump right on with 21 for AR purchase, ban bump stocks and other common sense reforms. Maybe just enhance the wall too and call it a day. Small wins create massive victories.
1539 2018-02-22 19:11:20 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1540 2018-02-22 19:11:10 Also; You still haven't answered my first question: How does restricting gun ownership to JUST those law abiding citizens who don't have Mental Health/criminal/abuse issues hurt you? Does increasing age hurt you? How about limiting magazine capacity? Banning bump stocks?
1541 2018-02-22 19:11:05 Completely understand the argument there and as a gun owner I am not a over bearing and blind owner. Some things should not be available to the public like bump stocks and such. That said, there would need be a system that allows all guns to be locked up in the school.
1542 2018-02-22 19:10:49 Bump stocks should have been banned the day after Las Vegas. They sold out of bump stocks that week. Too little, too late for bump stocks.
1543 2018-02-22 19:10:45 I play both calls and puts and not because I'm crazy. I've been crazy for a lot longer than I've been playing stocks and options. In fact, medicine and science haven't progressed far enough to help me.
1544 2018-02-22 19:10:44 It really isn’t  Bump stocks are just a fraction of modifications that can be done to a firearm. Hell, you can get a video tutorial on how to mess with the trigger mechanism to make an SKS or similar rifle into a fully-auto firearm. Which sounds pretty badass 
1545 2018-02-22 19:10:42 You guys are right--my initial tweet elided the distinction between semi and full auto. There are, however, bump stocks (see LV). Crappier accuracy, but they work.
1546 2018-02-22 19:10:31 Mijn hemel. Trump denkt erover om een bonus (door de NRA betaald, zeker?) te geven aan leraren die een gun dragen. Het is weer een "dubbel signaal" dat hij hiermee af geeft. Eerst voorstellen om betere handhaving/backgroundchecks voor kopers en het verbieden van 'bump stocks'. 
1547 2018-02-22 19:10:24 EO banning bump stocks and freezing the sales of assault rifles. Then let Congress make a law.
1548 2018-02-22 19:10:21 look at yesterday when Trump banned bump stocks, it's not enough, but kids walking out of class moved the needle 
we just keep pushing, and we win
1549 2018-02-22 19:10:16 Well, you’re not wrong. I was actually about to give him credit for saying that bump stocks and mental health evaluations need to be stricter and then he opened his mouth some more and ruined it. I hate him. I really do.
1550 2018-02-22 19:09:38 Of course gun stocks soar. Because the tidal wave of stocks lack of security is swayed by Trumps erratic behavior as if a cup turned over&the waters spilled to waste while parched onlookers wail in their desire "What shall we drink now but our own blood." Then what next spills?
1551 2018-02-22 19:09:37 Ahhh ahhh i can't seee
1552 2018-02-22 19:09:20 Bump stocks is a lie.
1553 2018-02-22 19:09:19 Meet Alva, a design tool built to help you invest in stocks .
1554 2018-02-22 19:08:52 Also, make the possession of bump stocks illegal..
1555 2018-02-22 19:08:51 Love dont forget about me! 
1556 2018-02-22 19:08:30 Trump is a genius.  We just ban assault rifles (and bump stocks) in video games.  Problem solved.
1557 2018-02-22 19:08:08 Right? To me, it shows the power of the gun lobby. Instead of advocating for removal of assault weapons (which have no place in society), they want to increase gun ownership/sales. Stronger background checks, removing bump stocks are a start, but not enough.
1558 2018-02-22 19:07:50 そういえば合宿の時にはお酒飲めるようになってるのか
1559 2018-02-22 19:07:41 Wait what? How does the use of bump stocks save lives? Any citation for that? [Also, you don't currently have a right to own AR-15 style weapons or large magazines as the courts have upheld laws banning their sales].
1560 2018-02-22 19:07:32 Bump stocks being made on 3D printers
1561 2018-02-22 19:07:28 At 5% I might be worried. That's where stocks could struggle. A long way to go
1562 2018-02-22 19:07:27 @BrookeBCNN Funny how the Democrats at the Town Hall meeting were pushing the very things Trump had proposed! Background checks, ban butt stocks etc. They are now the originators of those ideas and Trump wants to arm teachers! SHUT DOWN CNN! #SHUTDOWNCNN!
1563 2018-02-22 19:06:46 Here in MA they banned bump stocks after Vegas and introduced a bill that let the state temporarily confiscate weapons from people with mental health issues after parkland. Gun laws here are strict, the only way to go from here is a required bground check for private sales

1566 2018-02-22 19:06:40 Dont restrict bumo stocks! The 2nd ammendment is clear that citizens are to be sufficiently armed to defend themselves against tyranny of government if need be.
1567 2018-02-22 19:06:39 @Rowan_Stocks
1568 2018-02-22 19:06:34 You hypocrite Just what did you do after shootings on your watch only nice words from the father of lies It was the NRA that first brought background checks NRA is against bump stocks You are a BS artist of biblical proportions
1569 2018-02-22 19:06:29 In my and probably @Passion8Invstr case, we might not have this much stomach for volatility or risk. 

Your each PF stocks would at most be restricted to max 5% of my or his PF due to their inherent cyclical nature. But if you can catch cycle's and bet on it nothing like it. 2/2
1570 2018-02-22 19:06:27 MO: Example use cases: anomaly detection (abnormal trading patterns), price/KPI forecasting, classifications (identifying regime changes in market), clustering (grouping stocks or traders by behavior), reinforcement learning #sthlmai
1571 2018-02-22 19:06:07 Uhhhh it was used in the Las Vegas shooting. Do you not remember the huge issue regarding bump stocks afterwards? It increases the rate of fire for a semi-automatic rifle.
1572 2018-02-22 19:06:05 The Second Amendment says 'Right to bear arms'  Bump stocks are not guns.  You don't have a right to bump stocks.
1573 2018-02-22 19:06:03 God first woman wants bump stocks.
1574 2018-02-22 19:05:59 If you do ban assult weapons and bump stocks how are you going to get the ones that are already owned?  #confiscate
1575 2018-02-22 19:05:49 Are there any DP charges while selling it?
1576 2018-02-22 19:05:49 Ya Idk if arming the teachers is great idea. Total gun reform is impossible though, he'd lose his base and all his power.

So banning bump stocks and other accessories, raising the legal age to purchase a gun are the right steps. 

Difficult situation.

1579 2018-02-22 19:05:41 Don’t think stocks go down much . Messing with everyone . When in doubt get out
1580 2018-02-22 19:05:34 If you want ban “bump stocks,” the NRA won’t actively oppose it.  If you want to improve background checks and monitor crazy people, go for it.  AND THAT’S ALL.
1581 2018-02-22 19:04:59 Good-glad state rep Wayne speaking up-especially considering Ricketts men wouldn’t ban bump stocks. Hope people vote out these enablers of massacres along w our billionaire governor-
1582 2018-02-22 19:04:49 Consider restricting the manufacture of AR ammunition to 1500 FPS. This would cut the lethality to about 35%, bump stocks wouldn't work and gun owners could still shoot their rifle at the range.
1583 2018-02-22 19:04:47 Bow wow need to give up rap and just invest in stocks and bonds or open a barber shop or something 
1584 2018-02-22 19:04:26 And mass shootings are "gold" for weapon manufacturers because people buy more guns after a mass shooting. Even the stocks of those companies went up. This is so reckless of her.
1585 2018-02-22 19:04:23 & u should stop watching Fox News, bec Obama NEVER approved bump stocks & I challenge u to show me the EO where he did. Bec A)he cant, its a legislative issue, not an EO process & b)whoile it is true that the Dir of the ATF sent a letter re bump-stocks, it never APPROVED them...
1586 2018-02-22 19:04:00 I'm jacked I can still deploy my cash at these prices.  There should easily have been a 5% move in the stocks I'm looking to open holding in, after that EIA report.  Most well below 2%.
1587 2018-02-22 19:03:55 @realDonaldTrump 
TO DO LIST FOR THIS MONTH:
* Invoke congressional sanctions against Russia for interference in US elections
*Submit plan to Intelligence agencies to protect upcoming elections
*Sign Executive Orders banning sales of bump stocks and automatic weapons
*I hear you

1589 2018-02-22 19:03:14 Things Trump can do right now to improve his position:
1) Reverse his decision to rescind DACA.
2) Urge a vote on existing legislation to ban bump stocks & strengthen background checks. 
3) Impose bipartisan sanctions on Russia for hacking our democracy.
He will do none of this.
1590 2018-02-22 19:03:11 Bump stocks doesn’t do any difference on a rifle, and only the appearance of tactical. I am writing this and laughing myself for the ignorance
1591 2018-02-22 19:03:07 Bump stocks
1592 2018-02-22 19:03:05 I mean, Trump isn't just a businessman, he's "THE" Businessman.
I think he's got a plan and he's like 10 steps ahead. 
And I think the bump stocks are just a small part of it.
1593 2018-02-22 19:02:47 Obama was the one who approved bump stocks you are aware of that right?
1594 2018-02-22 19:02:43 Maybe consideration should be given to the fact that the 2nd amendment was written when there were neither street lamps nor federal/state police? Also, the 2nd doesn't excuse (nor allow) things like assault weapons, bump stocks and gun shows
1595 2018-02-22 19:02:38 Wouldn’t it be fitting that Kris uncovered a new line of revenue shorting vulnerable tech stocks?
1596 2018-02-22 19:02:24 and as the yields are trying to creep back up again after lunch, it seems to be putting downward pressure on stocks
1597 2018-02-22 19:02:17 I took the time to look up FL’s gun laws and it turns out that they already do mental health checks. Nikolas Cruz broke into his parents’ gun safe. Banning bump stocks won’t fix the problem and armed forces can carry guns at 18, so there’s a lot I take issue with here.
1598 2018-02-22 19:02:14 I am a liberal and I agree with @realDonaldTrump we need to focus on mental health, ban bump stocks, and expand background checks

Please Mr President, do these things
#thoughtsandprayers
1599 2018-02-22 19:02:13 @DLoesch Yes, you are correct about the media loving mass shootings or any lead that bleeds for that matter, but the NRA loves them much more than the media. Just look at their sales and stocks sky-rocket each and every time- It goes both ways.
1600 2018-02-22 19:02:05 End the sale of high velocity ammunition type firearms like the AR15 that do such horrible damage to the human body. Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
1601 2018-02-22 19:02:04 Trump eliminated Obamas registry for mentally ill. Trump didn't do anything after church massacre,. Trump didn't do anything after Las Vegas massacre. Didn't get rid of bump stocks.Didn't get rid of assault rifles.didn't get NRA out of his back pocket.
1602 2018-02-22 19:02:02 No one is talking about taking ALL guns away. Why is it people like you seem to conflate better gun laws and banning things like bump stocks and assault weapons with taking all guns away?
1603 2018-02-22 19:02:02 Where does the Constitution guarantee your right to own a bump stock?
Is Jesus in favor of guns and bump stocks?
1604 2018-02-22 19:01:37 I mean I personally feel that they shouldn't ban them just, I feel that the president is kind of giving in just to shut up all the libs but then again it's not like a high percentage of people use bump fire stocks do they?
1605 2018-02-22 19:01:30 E niente bump stocks, così imparano.
1606 2018-02-22 19:01:26 Someone dm'd me about not posting enough crypto stuff...ummmm...I refer you to my bio. I post nonsense. Topics include, but not limited to:  space, crypto, stocks, my dog, Iceland, photography, God, and @elonmusk -in no particular order.  Follow at your own risk. #dyor
1607 2018-02-22 19:01:08 When Trump says he will do an executive order to ban the bump stocks, that sounded like a wink to NRA. They know and he know the EO can be overturned. Need a bill to become law. Don’t recall Trump requesting a bill. SMH
1608 2018-02-22 19:01:03 As far as I know getting rid of bump stocks has to go through congress...
Anyone let Mitch McConnell or @SpeakerRyan know about this?
1609 2018-02-22 19:00:59 These politicians want to do something small—raise min ownership age, ban bump stocks, more bg checks—and hope we’ll stop talking about it. There’s only one solution we should accept: banning all assault weapons. Period.
1610 2018-02-22 19:00:35 USA

"We're going to do strong background checks. We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18. We're getting rid of the bump stocks, and we're going to be focusing very strongly on mental health" - Donald Trumps ‘To-Do’ list following Florida school shooting.
1611 2018-02-22 19:00:32 What's your thoughts on FIEC now?
1612 2018-02-22 19:00:02 @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio The NRA membership is 1.55% of the U.S. population.  How in the actual fuck should these people have so much pull with you?  Ban assault rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks now!
1613 2018-02-22 18:59:55 Again, bump stocks can be made incredibly easy, no amount of laws will change that. They will always be easy to make, so outlawing their purchase does literally nothing
1614 2018-02-22 18:59:53 Oh, Trump. You silly fuck. Lure us in with words of "considering banning bump stocks" and "enhancing background checks and mental health restrictions," then when you've got our attention, hit us with "arm teachers to thwart school shootings!" You are soooooo terrible. Eat lava.
1615 2018-02-22 18:59:48 Since it would go against the principles of the Democratic party, yes.

But I still think it'd prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that CNN is biased against Trump.

I do think Trump is just using Bump stocks as some form of leverage for something else, idk what though.
1616 2018-02-22 18:59:42 I’m pretty sure we (current crypto traders) are not their target market. They’re aiming for the people used to stocks that don’t even know you can send bitcoin to different addresses and can’t bother with securing wallets. I still think this is great for overall crypto adoption.
1617 2018-02-22 18:59:38 I have said literally NOTHING about disarming law abiding citizens. And the Dickey amendment does not allow anything that might "promote gun control" even if the research were to demonstrate that would keep people safer. So less safety is worth bumps stocks??
1618 2018-02-22 18:59:27 I'd like to see the environmental impact assessment for this. I would have thought that Dogger Bank is pretty important for fish stocks.
1619 2018-02-22 18:59:14 It depends. If you're in the S&P 500 for the long haul (10+ years), the stock market is in your favor. If you're in penny stock trading, you're gambling. Same with trading in general, but penny stocks are sketchy and manipulated.
1620 2018-02-22 18:59:12 Bump stocks by themselves are legal. It is not legal to put one on a gun!
1621 2018-02-22 18:59:12 eubanks is a trainers nightmare outside a paycheck. Most legit trainers want someone who will listen, work hard, &execute. Jr. is just a trainers paycheck..his business stocks have fallen as well. His father & him need to first REALIZE THEIR MISTAKES b4 anything.

1623 2018-02-22 18:59:11 um no, nothing relative about how many stocks are on the new low or new high list. it is what it is and the math isn't relative either.
1624 2018-02-22 18:58:54 And bump stocks turn ARs into rapid fire weapons.
1625 2018-02-22 18:58:46 Yesterday's moves post-Fed Minutes reflect the continuing tug-of-war in the markets: the selloff in #bonds pushed #stocks lower, which helped to stabilize bonds and ignite today's rally.
1626 2018-02-22 18:58:37 And today is talking about mental health check, raising age limit and since December, has been pushing sessions to find him a LEGAL way to ban bump stocks and get it on his desk to be signed.
1627 2018-02-22 18:58:26 Bump stocks are an accessory, not a firearm, so no, banning them wouldn’t violate the second amendment.
1628 2018-02-22 18:57:44 @realDonaldTrump 
President Trump, you really think banning bump stocks is going to stop school violence..your wrong.
Your infringing on our rights.

1631 2018-02-22 18:57:26 Were you watching it just now?

This hasn't happened before, after any shooting, ever. And talking about real-world solutions that make sense. Banning bump-stocks. Raising age limit to 21. Increased background checks. Trained conceal carry deterrence in schools. All sensible.
1632 2018-02-22 18:57:26 bump stocks are a fire arm part and are Not regulated. Is there a single person in the republican party that can tell the truth? No ethics, No honor you are liars and con men. congrats.
1633 2018-02-22 18:56:51 We live in a society where people below 21 can't drink, but they can buy guns.

On some levels, I agree with you: 18-21 should be allowed to buy hunting rifles. Semi-autos, high cap mags. bump stocks? Absolutely not. And you know there is no reason for them to have those.
1634 2018-02-22 18:56:46 @realDonaldTrump has blamed basically everything imaginable for #Parkland

Everything except semiautomatic rifles being legally accessible by mentally unstable teenagers

He says they'll "look at" bump stocks/age restrictions/background checks/etc

They said that after #Vegas too
1635 2018-02-22 18:56:42 Second Amendment doesn't say a thing about semiautomatics, 30-round magazines, bump stocks, background checks...
1636 2018-02-22 18:56:35 STOP SPREADING FALSEHOODS. That was not his only solution. He backed comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health, wants to raise the minimum ownership age to 21, and wants to end the sale of bump stocks made legal during the OBAMA administration.
1637 2018-02-22 18:56:34 If the 2A wasn't already being infringed upon it's my right to have the same arms as the gov't which would make bump stocks obsolete.
1638 2018-02-22 18:56:29 Says arms. That includes parts,accessories,and ammunition. If you want to do away with bumb stocks then do away with their reason for existing. Repeal the Hughes amendment that was illegally pushed through by Charley rangel.
1639 2018-02-22 18:56:23 Stiffer background checks, ban bump stocks, major increase in mental health checks.....

Start there...... Just sayin
1640 2018-02-22 18:56:19 That is how you fix the school shooting problem mr. President. Not by banning weapons and bump stocks. They do not kill anyone just bad people are murderers
1641 2018-02-22 18:56:08 Arming teachers wonct work because when swat comes in they won't be able to tell if the teacher is the shooter or another victim. The teacher may get shot trying to save lives .  Just ban the bump stocks and semi automatic weapons.
1642 2018-02-22 18:56:01 negotiate with bumper stocks u have completely lost the argument of gun control b/c u admit it's the gun, not the criminal@POTUS
1643 2018-02-22 18:55:29 I own several guns. I have no disagreement with gun ownership. 1st we need to ban bump stocks, the AR-15 and like weapons, have complete and full background checks, have waiting periods, and get away from the dangerous gun fetish
1644 2018-02-22 18:55:25 Just look at DT followers and stocks they all talk about together.

1647 2018-02-22 18:55:17 Same if a celebrity who sponsers a famous brand and criticizes it. The stock would go down. The update has gotten hate from many and her cementing the same feelings caused it to plummet. I don't buy individual stocks anyway but that's why.
1648 2018-02-22 18:55:08 Since the media, and powers that be, have now decided that the true problems are mental health and bump stocks, not the statues and memorials of Confederate dead, then those Monuments should be replaced.
1649 2018-02-22 18:55:06 Focus on this and NOT on bump stocks or age limits.
1650 2018-02-22 18:55:06 It is NOT positive action to read to a heartbroken room that he hears them, and then do nothing. (Its not so much NRA but gun manufacturers.)What hunter/personal home protector needs combat assault rifles and bump stocks to keep a house safe? U wldn't display a deer w 100 holes!
1651 2018-02-22 18:55:05 Les stocks ce remettent au bout de combien de temps pour tous ce qui est config ? :)
1652 2018-02-22 18:54:53 @FoxNewsSunday  Mr. Wallace, saw you on @OutnumberedOT You talked about @POTUS needing new law to ban bump stocks. I suggest you do some research on all the "other" ways to create the same effect of bump stocks. Like rubber bands. Belt loops as well. Will have to ban them too.
1653 2018-02-22 18:54:38 Bump stocks are selling well now, even though the manufacturers increased the costs significantly. NRA loves the cha-ching.
1654 2018-02-22 18:54:37 You can just use a belt to simulate one, buy them from friends on the black market, or just use a 3d printer to make one. That funniest thing about all this talk of banning firearms and bump stocks of is that 3d printing has rendered all of that archaic.
1655 2018-02-22 18:54:31 Arms, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  Bump stocks are a party to that sentence.  Constitutionally regulation from the national govt should have zero authority. States however, there is an argument for such regulations at the state level.
1656 2018-02-22 18:54:28 Who told you that owning a bump stock is your right? Show us in the Constitution where it mentions bp stocks.
1657 2018-02-22 18:54:22 So the reversal isn't too obvious as it seems as the market rolling over! Watch out for the nasdaq composite to sell off to it's 50d MA. I honestly don't see any actionable long ideas today. I went from 90% long stocks to 10% today!
1658 2018-02-22 18:54:21 I support  stricter background check and bang on bump stocks… I don’t support raising the age. To buy firearms though majority of mass shootings are done by people that are older than 19… Don’t punish the responsible young gun owners
1659 2018-02-22 18:54:04 #bbcr4today #tonighttv3 #vinb #skynews Goddammit - out by 50mins in my morning prediction of when today's Fed/EU fuelled spike in stocks at citizens expense would occur!  All a 'wealth effect' scam & to mask that DC pensions are other than old age risk-stressors which they are!
1660 2018-02-22 18:54:01 So I can't yell "fire!" in crowded theater or tell a mob that we need to "get rid of" or local politician with my first amendment rights, but god forbid I try to make someone stop selling bump stocks because of their impervious second amendment right? GTFO @NRA
1661 2018-02-22 18:53:52 I remember when the second amendment was written, the diaries left by the founding fathers actually have around 4 pages covering that bump stocks should never be banned!
1662 2018-02-22 18:53:45 but the nra says "muh bump stocks"
1663 2018-02-22 18:53:38 And stocks of gun companies rise. So sick in the bad way.
1664 2018-02-22 18:53:34 2/ However, the Act defines fully automatic weapon in such a way that bump stocks are not covered.  Therefore the Obama Administration concluded, probably correctly, that they had no authority to right regulations eliminating or prohibiting bump stocks.
1665 2018-02-22 18:53:32 Positives from @realDonaldTrump: banning bump stocks, raising age to 21, more extensive background checks. Negatives: bonuses to teachers who carry concealed weapons??? Huh??? #Education #schoolsafety
1666 2018-02-22 18:53:31 Back ground checks for bump stocks but don't all out ban them
1667 2018-02-22 18:53:31 I track the top 5 (weighted) stocks in each sector. Times they were all green today. First ones to start to deteriorate were FANG stocks.
1668 2018-02-22 18:53:25 Unless they're, willing to support raising age of purchase, elimination of bump stocks, no sales @ gun shows, & ban on sale of assault weapons, they're not willing to do enough. 1 child's life abruptly ended is more valuable than any argument for why these conditions can't be met
1669 2018-02-22 18:53:12 How many others died in Vegas due to bump stocks?
1670 2018-02-22 18:52:43 If the Clintons aren’t punished for their crimes the

1672 2018-02-22 18:52:23 The 2nd Amendment doesn't protect bump stocks. It's not your right.
1673 2018-02-22 18:52:06 They will ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks if they are such great people otherwise they are enablers to the mass murderers.
1674 2018-02-22 18:51:42 Larry Hogan and guns:

A- rating from the @NRA 

Taken thousands in donations from @NRA 

Won’t support banning bump stocks in Maryland 

In favor of allowing guns on college campuses 
1675 2018-02-22 18:51:23 At least trump is doing something! He is proposing banning bump stocks and sale of guns under 21. All Obama did was cry.
1676 2018-02-22 18:51:18 I’m very pro-2A but bump stocks...why would anyone need that? I didn’t use mods like that in the military. Why do citizens needs this? I fully support pistols and rifles, including the AR-15. Mods like this, no.
1677 2018-02-22 18:50:53 Crypto stocks are falling and I love it
1678 2018-02-22 18:50:42 I'm waiting to see if cnn writes a fluff piece defending bump stocks now.
1679 2018-02-22 18:50:42 Again, gun show loophole, you reversed bill making it harder for mental ill to get guns and you alone, can’t regulate bump stocks. Good show you’re putting on. What you really want is more guns
1680 2018-02-22 18:50:39 Show me where “bump stocks” are mentioned in your constitution. Do you also own a musket and are a member of a well organized militia?
1681 2018-02-22 18:50:12 If 2017 was a party. 2018 is going to be the hangover morning. 

Choose your stocks prudently. You will get enough time to research and buy. 

No hurry, nothing is running away.
1682 2018-02-22 18:50:09 Guess I need to go buy a couple bump stocks now, not what I wanted to spend money on atm
1683 2018-02-22 18:49:50 Because bump stocks are an inanimate object in the sub-sect of arms, but abortions are an action in the sub-sect of murder. That's the difference.
1684 2018-02-22 18:49:49 Now Donald you know bump stocks won’t do it.  You know as well as anybody that you must ban assault rifles but your bosses at the NRA won’t let you.  You need to be an adult.
1685 2018-02-22 18:49:39 I have always done my own fundamental analysis. Never bought or sold any stock on any one else conviction or suggestion. Am bad at technical analysis so was putting up query. Also it’s not bad to have others opinions as well on some of the other stocks in my portfolio
1686 2018-02-22 18:49:34 @vladstocks what were the three books you read to get your knowledge on stocks
1687 2018-02-22 18:49:33 Our president and idiot is willing to ban bump stocks because he knows it will make no difference. You can ban bump stocks but the firing technique can be done with as little as a belt loop.  This is nothing more than bad political theater.
1688 2018-02-22 18:49:23 She is as sick as the rest of the enablers. We will vote the NRA’s puppets out of office. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES & BUMP STOCKS NOW!
1689 2018-02-22 18:49:22 Rising rates are good for stocks @CNBC said so.  So it must be true.
1690 2018-02-22 18:49:05 I should buy stocks in Snapchat today cause after they fix this shit, it will be popping again! 
I hope
1691 2018-02-22 18:49:02 Oh, and bump stocks!
1692 2018-02-22 18:48:08 Did you know bump stocks are made so handicap Americans can exercise their 2nd amendment rights. I bet not since you want to remove their right to do so.
1693 2018-02-22 18:48:01 The NRA doesn’t want to outlaw bump stocks. Try NRA doesn’t want to raise the age for buying guns. The NRA is not open waiting periods. These are things we would accept even if we can’t get assault weapons banned. The NRA is unwilling to compromise.
1694 2018-02-22 18:47:42 Comprehensive background checks, is a must!  I agree with banning bump stocks, raising the age to 21 will be controversial, but, in the end, I do think that this would work in the best interest of society, as a whole. Congress must unite on this issue for the good of our country!
1695 2018-02-22 18:47:40 Trump proved that the Democrat Party didn't want to help DACA kids. Now he's going to prove that they don't want to stop gun violence. New legislation to enact tougher background checks and banning bump stocks will be demagogue and rejected by the Dems. Watch!
1696 2018-02-22 18:47:36 I'm with you on mental health and raising the age but YOU SIR, ARE WRONG ON BUMP STOCKS!  Read the FEDERALIST PAPERS!!!  If our government becomes oppressive, we MUST have the SAME ability to fight against them.  WE KNOW these events are manufactured BY the GOVT, and so do you.
1697 2018-02-22 18:47:35 Stocks, ban. " ENHANCED" Triggers no ban. 19 age of purchase unless in service (millitary only 2privaterank). Everything else stays the same, unless government hits police first, and methodically, equalized to common man.
1698 2018-02-22 18:47:29 Yes - comprehsive mental health testing esential and get rid of bump stocks that make semis basically automatics 
1699 2018-02-22 18:47:26 I think they are moving in the right direction with bump stocks, raising the age, and hopefully stricter mental evaluations but arming teachers isn't the answer. Maybe a compromise to put guards at schools? Idk, something needs done tho.
1700 2018-02-22 18:47:19 I guess it depends. The laws being what they are now it's a no. But I believe full auto shouldnt be outlawed. 
But if full auto is outlawed. So should bump stocks.
1701 2018-02-22 18:47:11 What the NRA refuses to accept is that background checks, an assault weapons ban, a ban on bump stocks and high capacity magazines do no infringe on the rights of Americans to own a gun.  MR. TRUMP do the right thing.. arming teachers is not a solution.
1702 2018-02-22 18:46:55 UPDATE: U.S. stocks trim gains further, Nasdaq turns negative
1703 2018-02-22 18:46:46 Mainstream American here with no ties to the Florida victims. 

I support improved background checks, banning bump stocks, AND an AR-15 ban.
1704 2018-02-22 18:46:35 The age old question. Do you buy and hold or do you bunt for quick return over and over again.i only play oil and gold sector. The 30 cnd stocks in each I track are mtd oil -4.0% miners -7.1% as.a group. As of today my mtd on 120 trades is up 16.5%.300-500 sh/per pos -3-6 pos/day
1705 2018-02-22 18:46:14 Do this then:
Annual Mental health exams for ALL gun owners. 
Annual Proficiency tests for ALL gun owners. 
Ban assault rifles. 
Ban bump stocks. 
Ban large magazines. 
Mandatory background checks for ALL gun sales, gun shops, gun shows, online and private sales. 
Bet you fail.
1706 2018-02-22 18:46:11 Not as much as gun stock prices do. I was thinking about purchasing gun stocks, but I have a soul and a concious, and that's disgusting.
1707 2018-02-22 18:46:11 don't you love all these stocks up 10, 20, 30% ... and with no earnings?
What a market! $$
1708 2018-02-22 18:46:06 Wouldn’t it be nice for $SPY to break down in this 11th year into a bull market on 22/2/2018(11/2) at 2:00 clock  #stocks #markets #equities #spy #fin #marketnumbers #numerology #numbers
1709 2018-02-22 18:45:55 Circumventing laws (automatic weapons ban) by loophole devices such as bump stocks is part of the problem.  Using this logic, you should be able to purchase the parts needed to assemble a nuclear bomb.
1710 2018-02-22 18:45:27 This solves absolutely nothing and only makes law abiding citizens be demonized. Bump stocks are not an issue and people can still bump fire without it.
1711 2018-02-22 18:45:27 @realDonaldTrump@marcorubio. Bump stocks are not enough. 30 day waiting period, no criminal record, training required, no gun shows & NO SEMI AUTOMATIC weapons. #BanAssaultWeapons
1712 2018-02-22 18:45:22 That argument is about augments to the gun (LCMs and bump stocks) and the manner in which they are made available.  Because existing laws are poorly crafted doesn't mean they can't, and shouldn't, be updated to better serve the purpose (as CT did after Sandy Hook).
1713 2018-02-22 18:45:14 @TheBubbleBubble The crazy thing is this we have had only 3 bad years in stocks over the past 25 years but people have been doing bad financially for 25 years. Most of the population is barely making it and 60-70 million would be in the streets if it weren’t for welfare. Believe
1714 2018-02-22 18:45:07 You promise to protect our 2nd Amendment rights bumper stocks are part of those rights we don't have 24 hour for Life security@POTUS
1715 2018-02-22 18:44:53 @SenateMajLdr I would like to see bump stocks banned on a Federal level. Let’s get that done.
1716 2018-02-22 18:44:48 Mr TRUMP are you a complete IDIOT??? The Parkland Shooter did not throw Bump Stocks at the 17 Students and Teachers Murdered, He used an AUTOMATIC WEAPON. A Fucking Machine Gun purchased by an 18 year old. Grow some Balls TRUMP, Stop Automatic Weapons in mainstream America. ..
1717 2018-02-22 18:44:45 The whole purpose of bump stocks are to assist gun owners who have specific disabilities.  One can actually use a belt to achieve the same effect though.
1718 2018-02-22 18:44:45 Any one know how much XLE stocks in the $SPX have subtracted?
1719 2018-02-22 18:44:40 Trump just banned Bump stocks... In the end, Rep and Dem all the same.
1720 2018-02-22 18:44:38 "Quoi ?? L'effondrement ? ... Pfff, t'inquiète pas pour les stocks on va tout acheter"
1721 2018-02-22 18:44:24 Until assault rifles, high capacity ammunition, and bump stocks are banned, no one is safe anywhere...not in our schools, movie theatres, churches, etc. #GunControlNow
1722 2018-02-22 18:44:10 I'm taking ALLLL my Money out of crypto and putting it in regular stocks. bitcoin been misbehaving for too long
1723 2018-02-22 18:44:08 Again, you’re just giving us “it ain’t perfect, do nothing”. I think bump stocks and assault weapons should be banned, because I’ve never been given a good reason why they should be in circulation. Legislation can be crafted, loopholes can be closed.
1724 2018-02-22 18:43:56 @SpeakerRyan  I would like to see bump stocks banned on a Federal level. Let’s get that done.
1725 2018-02-22 18:43:48 It's not your ground to give or take. It's a constitutional right with a range of interpretations. You're being asked by people who gave up their children to give up high capacity magazines or bump stocks. Any solution remains within the 2A.
1726 2018-02-22 18:43:48 By going after bumper stocks you have admitted that the gun is the problem not the criminal!@POTUS
1727 2018-02-22 18:43:39 ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS BACKGROUND CHECKS! NO AR15 ON THE STREETS OF USA!NO BUMP. STOCKS AND AGE LIMITS ON SELL OF GUNS!
1728 2018-02-22 18:43:33 Really feel the tide is turning on here against the bucket shop shit placing stocks. Time will tell.
1729 2018-02-22 18:43:32 What pharma stocks are performing better than their peers in this market? If you know, please share.
1730 2018-02-22 18:43:29 Me: *Jamming and rapping along to a song about selling dope and being strapped, while I am wearing a sweater and looking at stocks*
1731 2018-02-22 18:43:24 What a nonsensical argument.  What did people do before bump stocks to preserve this right you insist upon, Anna?  Exercise their trigger finger?  Why do you need to shoot 9 rounds a second, ever?  A bump stock is not "your guns".
1732 2018-02-22 18:43:17 Lot of news on this one
1733 2018-02-22 18:43:10 I need to invest in some stocks!!
1734 2018-02-22 18:43:01 Bumper stocks! really mr. President! perhaps you should start with the FBI they seem totally incompetent@POTUS
1735 2018-02-22 18:42:57 Bump stocks are shitty anyone. Nobody even uses them. This is literally Trump pandering to the left on a BS issue. Lol
1736 2018-02-22 18:42:49 Stiffer background checks, ban bump stocks, major increase in mental health checks.....

Start there...... Just sayin
1737 2018-02-22 18:42:42 @RepCharlieDent @SenToomey @SenBobCasey 

Lets cut the shit and just ban high capacity magazines already! 

Illegal to: Possess, Sell, Modify or Manufacture..full stop! 

If you want to throw in bump stocks to feel good, fine..GET THE MAGAZINES! 

#BanHiCapMagazines
1738 2018-02-22 18:42:40 They will get some huge sales and stocks will climb as we implement all students over 11 carry guns. Invest in @NRA
1739 2018-02-22 18:42:31 I don't care how much the $DJI is up. It has faded all day, is below Monday & yesterday's highs & stocks are acting badly. Still short $SPY Holding mostly cash. #Thistapesucks #Stuckinatradingrange #LeadersStalling
1740 2018-02-22 18:42:24 You might get bump stocks (pointless because they’re easily DYI) but the rest? The government can’t effectively manage  immigration, the VA, illicit drugs, the national debt, or social security, but we think they’re going to stop every wacko in the country getting a gun?
1741 2018-02-22 18:42:23 @realDonaldTrump 3/You are also incorrect that armed teachers in schools will stop the cowards. Most commit suicide, they do not care if they die because they are severely disturbed. The only answer is to ban military style weapons to public,, extended magazines, bump stocks /
1742 2018-02-22 18:42:19 We don't know the details of exactly what "caused" the Las Vegas shooting. Bump-stocks are junk, and in the Las Vegas case "may" have actually saved lives by throwing off Paddock's aim. Then again, with a crowd that big set out in such a manner, it may have greatly killed more.
1743 2018-02-22 18:42:15 Banning bump stocks doesn't affect your ability to own a gun, Anna.
1744 2018-02-22 18:41:47 Civilians can make bump stocks, no need to buy them, they are super easy to make. But yeah they can
1745 2018-02-22 18:41:26 “the right to bear bump stocks”...? lol
1746 2018-02-22 18:41:19 Then why are you planning to ban bump stocks?
1747 2018-02-22 18:40:45 What the hell are you talking about? It damn sure does. "Bump Stocks and Components. Bump firing is a well-established capability that uses the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession." Sounds like a machine gun to the rest of us.
1748 2018-02-22 18:40:37 The guy in Las Vegas didn’t have a history of mental issues. You need to look up how many people died and were wounded because of the use of bump stocks. I am a conservative republican and own guns but you have to look at the carnage that man caused. No bump stocks.
1749 2018-02-22 18:40:24 As for bump stocks....yeah you've got me there.  I've seen a few in action and while it drastically cuts down on accuracy, it essentially gives you a legal automatic weapon.  Not sure how they became legal in the first place.
1750 2018-02-22 18:40:16 The truth like allegedly supporting banning bump stocks yet doing nothing? That's what came out of the Las Vegas Massacre, they eventually were dragged to support it then nothing happened because they paid off congress... Facts don't matter
1751 2018-02-22 18:40:14 I had just had same thought when I saw guy's tweet a couple minutes ago, that she could easily have puts. Or what's his name, Kanye? isn't he married to one and gave her stocks? Or is that Beyonce and her husband? I get them all confused.
1752 2018-02-22 18:40:06 Ending the sale of bump stocks? So the poor shooters can only kill 20 people instead of 50? Ban assault rifles and high capacity magazines.
1753 2018-02-22 18:40:05 ATTENTION AMERICA 

If minorities start buying rifles, bump stocks or magazines you'll see #guncontrol.
Or until the @NRA stops paying off crooked politicians and the @GOP stops taking millions.

#ParklandStudents inspire me. I believe in them! Sadly I'm afraid change won't come!
1754 2018-02-22 18:39:59 Guns and bump stocks are created to kill people( semi automatic weapons). Computers are not.....
1755 2018-02-22 18:39:54 Super easy.....ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, increase background checks....especially at show grounds, ban on line sales of guns.....done!
1756 2018-02-22 18:39:52 De får gärna förbjuda bump stocks. De har inget rimligt syfte, bl a för att det bara funkar om man struntar i vad man träffar.
1757 2018-02-22 18:39:51 You and I tweeted about bump stocks yesterday evening. 

May I ask you to follow me for a DM I believe will be helpful?
1758 2018-02-22 18:39:51 yeah, that Vegas shooter was only an 18 year old kid......with ballistic tables and bump stocks
1759 2018-02-22 18:39:43 You clearly don’t understand guns or bump stocks.
1760 2018-02-22 18:39:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1761 2018-02-22 18:39:31 Assault rifles, high capacity magazines, suppressors, bump stocks, cross state cc all must be outlawed. Gun ownership must be qualified and regulated. End this debate right now.
1762 2018-02-22 18:39:29 Bumper stocks mr. President now we're going to blame parts of the gun for the crime?
Perhaps we should disarm the FBI they seem totally incompetent!
1763 2018-02-22 18:38:58 Stash isn’t bad at all. I prefer the Robinhood app, personally. It has real time market feed, direct bank deposit/withdrawal and alerts to hot stocks of the day. Plus, you can track a stock up to 5yrs back to see its growth and recovery rate
1764 2018-02-22 18:38:53 I am watching it live. I like @POTUS ideas! How do we get rid of the bump stocks that are already out there? Black market?  Parents and guardians NEED to watch their kids behavior, their computer use, etc. Actually, invade kids privacy to stop this stuff from before it starts.
1765 2018-02-22 18:38:46 This should be gun law! Get rid of assault rifles & bump stocks. Change age to 21. Have extensive background checks. Have people do a 1 month weapons training & safety class. Make sure felons, People on the no fly list, terrorists, & mentally ill cannot get weapons! HELL WITH NRA
1766 2018-02-22 18:38:37 NRA is not an organization that I voted for to run this country, yet they influence those we did vote in. Yes, we can own guns - handguns, rifles, shotguns - why do we need assault rifles, hi cap. magazines, silencers & bump stocks? How does NOT owning those make us less free?
1767 2018-02-22 18:38:17 Not really, I support gun ownership. I don’t see the purpose for a civilian to own a AR-15 or bump stocks. I’m former military those guns are meant to kill as many people as possible in a short period of time.
1768 2018-02-22 18:38:05 As much money as we spend T @GameStop I should own a share in their stocks #GSTaxDeals
1769 2018-02-22 18:38:01 I have a little excel file that I have been tracking for cgy la Ana sis 

I rated a win or loss or 50/50 let's just say ana has rolled in the last few games won 3 scheduled loss 1 50/50 but lost 1 scheduled win. 

Stocks are going up and down
1770 2018-02-22 18:37:58 What a joke TRUMP is. After Another school massacre TRUMP wants to ban Bump Stocks so Semi - Automatic weapons can't be turned into a Machine Gun. The AR-15 is a Machine Gun and doesn't need a Bump Stock...
1771 2018-02-22 18:37:49 It takes literally 2 seconds to change a clip. I don’t honestly feel like clip size changes anything for a shooter. Bump stocks on the other hand, yeah I can see how that would make a difference.
1772 2018-02-22 18:37:47 Bump stocks are just where it starts. Parents start raising your kids and stop trying to be their friend. And stop letting grandma and grandpa raise them cause you were to young to have a kid and you still want to go out and party.
1773 2018-02-22 18:37:14 Honestly banning bump stocks and rasing the age limit for the purchase of guns are steps in the right direction. Just like the guy who says we’re trying to take away his guns, we have to ignore the other extreme too. We can’t wait for the perfect bill.  Lives depend on it.
1774 2018-02-22 18:37:08 $VOYT 0.0009 lotto I am watching it needs volume
1775 2018-02-22 18:37:07 hell, you couldn't even get your own Congress to ban bump stocks after the Vegas shooting.
1776 2018-02-22 18:36:57 Don’t be mad because you can’t fit my commentary into a category that you’re familiar with. PS: Trump didn’t do shit to actually ban bump stocks, and banning bump stocks is a bandaid.
1777 2018-02-22 18:36:56 #stocks Expect to soon see the end of the Obama boom.
1778 2018-02-22 18:36:32 You are a farse. What did you do to help? NOTHING. You gave money to terrorists, you weaponized the IRS, FBI & DOJ, spied on citizens and approved bump stocks. We took our country back and we're keeping it from harmful parasitic socialists like you. #MAGA.
1779 2018-02-22 18:36:20 NRA = hardline against gun control, against background checks, etc.  trumps a narcissist and an old NY liberal...you're going to get at least beefed-up background checks, and banning of bump stocks, out of him, if not more...but keep resisting, babe
1780 2018-02-22 18:36:07 @realDonaldTrump @GOP I would happily agree to move the age to buy any gun to 21 and the loss of bump stocks if we get the passing of the #ReciprocityAct
1781 2018-02-22 18:36:04 I’m fine with raising the age requirement to purchase a firearm to 21 and I don’t care about bump stocks.  That said we should be able to buy full auto firearms
1782 2018-02-22 18:36:04 Do you agree with Trump moving to ban bump stocks?
1783 2018-02-22 18:36:02 Hi Mark, the current limitation is based on how the securities are traded (unlike stocks or ETFs, funds can be purchased with specific $ amounts, trade once a day, etc.). We're sharing your feedback about wanting this option for ETFs as well. Thanks!
1784 2018-02-22 18:35:39 Bad Trump!! Restrictions on bump stocks are just a way for the Dems to get ball rolling on modifications to guns and eventually take guns from us. Don't let them fool you.  You're smarter than that.
1785 2018-02-22 18:34:53 I know it doesn't stand for assault rifle, and I know it isn't automatic. My argument is against rate of fire and magazine size. And bump stocks while we're at it.
1786 2018-02-22 18:34:12 Yes ! Brilliant they've caught him. Now put him in public stocks, low life
1787 2018-02-22 18:34:02 Semiautomatics should be age restricted 21 and up.  18 yr olds should still be allowed to buy bolt action rifles or pump shotguns for hunting.  Not a lot of mass shootings with bolt action rifles.  All the rest Background checks and bump stocks is great   I hope Congress does it.
1788 2018-02-22 18:33:58 Why are politicians and the left so afraid of bump stocks? 

If you read their words it’s obvious; they perceive (incorrectly) that it empowers the citizen with a level of firepower they believe should be reserved exclusively for use by the state.
1789 2018-02-22 18:33:42 There are a lot of 18 year olds who are responsible but I do like it being pushed to 21. Bump stocks are a joke which need to be banned. And all Dems and Reps can agree our background checking needs to be redone it has flaws atm. If these go through it's a win for Trump.
1790 2018-02-22 18:33:28 We CANNOT see that RAISING purchaser age from 18 to 21 will do one damn thing! It WON'T! Better vetting & outlawing BUMP STOCKS is a start!
1791 2018-02-22 18:33:25 Haven't you seen Dawn of the Dead? Bump Stocks will be a must have in the zombie apocalypse!
1792 2018-02-22 18:33:16 When the 2nd Amendment was created by our Founding Fathers the musket was the weapon of choice. #NRA arm all your members with muskets and ban all assault rifles, high capacity ammunition, and bump stocks. #GunControlNow
1793 2018-02-22 18:33:04 If I invested in walking boot stocks in 2007, one of my robot servants would be typing this tweet right now.
1794 2018-02-22 18:32:56 Are you paying attention?? The law does not just prevent people from owning bump stocks!! The term "bump stock" has a very lose meaning, so any law regarding it has to be written with lose language, meaning anyone can be caught up in loopholes, even people who have fast fingers
1795 2018-02-22 18:32:34 TRUMP: "We're going to do strong background checks. We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18. We're getting rid of the bump stocks. And we're going to be focusing very strongly on mental health."
1796 2018-02-22 18:32:29 I’m a conservative Marco but just like their should be reasonable restrictions on abortion late term etc there should be reasonable restrictions on gun ownership age bump stocks  and yes ARs
1797 2018-02-22 18:32:21 Back when that right was formed automatic weapons and bump stocks didn’t even exist. I imagine this wouldn’t be such a discussion if they had existed, they’d already be more restricted or banned.
1798 2018-02-22 18:32:03 Long guns, bump stocks, AK, all great headline keywords, but any semi-automatic pistol can do the same thing; headlines are as dangerous as law enforcement not doing their jobs.
1799 2018-02-22 18:31:35 Bump stocks should be illegal and I would suggest limiting magazine capacity like California did.  But people have already found workarounds to limited magazine capacities.
1800 2018-02-22 18:31:24 So now guns don't kill people, bump stocks do.... Ok... and how I hold a spoon causes me to gain weight.
1801 2018-02-22 18:31:19 The only thing I'll concede is that it's not an "assault rifle" as it doesn't meet your U.S definition including automatic firing, bump stocks and trigger modifications not inclusive.
1802 2018-02-22 18:31:17 And did u notice that chicago is gun free zone with hundreds of deaths, if a person want to do harm they will  Trump has ban gun stocks.  He has slready increased background  and is listening before knee jerk laws. Are you involved teaching our youth that there is a better way?
1803 2018-02-22 18:31:09 Wondering where the NRA gets all their money, it's very possible they are involved with Russian money laundering & using the money to payoff politicians so they can continue to do as they wish, like selling AR 15 assault rifles & bump stocks to anyone who wants them.
1804 2018-02-22 18:30:57 Your right to fire a shit load of bullets for no apparent reason?! Marksmanship takes calmness & a few bullets.
Any marksman will tell you about accuracy fatigue.
Bump Stocks don't make any sense; unless you making expensive cullenders.
Common sense should be a right too.
1805 2018-02-22 18:30:50 It is not your right to own and use "bump stocks." Neither history nor the law support this baseless assertion.
1806 2018-02-22 18:30:40 Stocks up today following yesterday’s DRAMATIC reversal! So what’s driving today’s rally? Tune in at 2pm ET to find out + latest from the White House.

1807 2018-02-22 18:30:37 If you don’t know...I honestly don’t know what to say. They have COMPLETELY and fiercely opposed ANY and ALL common sense controls!! After Vegas, first claiming would back getting rid of bump stocks, went back on it when law was proposed. It failed:because $$$ They are the enemy.
1808 2018-02-22 18:30:34 Overall though, not disappointed, bump stocks are lame.
1809 2018-02-22 18:30:33 I also think there's proposed legislation to ban bump stocks and I can't think of anyone that would disagree with that either.  That's a loophole that needs closing.
1810 2018-02-22 18:30:33 Raising the age to 21 is good and bump stocks need to be  outlawed not just an ATF regulation #About time
1811 2018-02-22 18:30:21 Bio stocks are so weak today
1812 2018-02-22 18:30:16 Stocks went down by 20% for gun manufacturers after the 2016 election. NRA stokes fear to drive sales. So to them they pad their pockets one mass murder at a time. They are the scum of the earth.
1813 2018-02-22 18:30:16 Ok @realDonaldTrump 1) “extreme vetting”, 2) Executive Orders for increasing age and bump stocks, 3) reinstate blocking of mentally ill buying guns.  Too simple?
1814 2018-02-22 18:30:14 Twitter Stocks down this morning as news of the way they mistreat conservatives hits Fox News.  Now is a good time for a 24 hr MAGA Twitter Time Out!
1815 2018-02-22 18:30:11 How can one #value a #home , #farm ,#shop or #Gold? Atleat we are finding it really tough since this #Assets doesnt has its underlying value . A #Stock has its own underlying things hence we can #buy & value a stock . #longterm #investing always pays of . #StockMarket #stocks
1816 2018-02-22 18:29:54 So, comprehensive background checks and closing gun show loopholes makes us Marxists? Trump mentioned reg bump stocks. Is he a commie?
1817 2018-02-22 18:29:50 I just stated this on another article, the coincidence of Gun Industry stocks going up, after mass shootings, every single person who's profiting,  has blood on their hands, I want to vomit
1818 2018-02-22 18:29:39 I've wasted all the time I'm going to. Bans are a place to start. Do you honestly think the framers of the constitution could have imagined bump stocks that turn semi automatic weapons into fully automatic? Be a thorn in someone else's side. #EnoughisEnough #NeverAgain
1819 2018-02-22 18:29:36 No one is trying to ban all guns or take yours away, claiming you have a 2nd amendment right to bump stocks is ignorant. Machine guns and rocket launchers are already illegal, so clearly federal courts don't think you have a right to own any weapon you'd like.
1820 2018-02-22 18:29:34 @realDonaldTrump No responsible gun owner would say no to annually register and license a legal weapon. Can't produce the proper documentation? Your weapon gets confiscated. (Ban assault weapons, large magazines and bump stocks) Have "buyback" program. #neveragain #MSDStrong
1821 2018-02-22 18:29:32 Regardless of pro-gun or anti-gun. this guy's argument is awful. "Watch me miss this tiny target from a distance! That proves it's ineffective at shooting crowds!" 

I agree, bump stocks aren't great, are inaccurate, and are used by "jackasses". That doesn't make them harmless.
1822 2018-02-22 18:29:23 There is literally no point in banning bump stocks ... clearly you’ve never own a weapons or did any research... but you can make a bump stock with a god damn paper clip.. or anything in your house.
1823 2018-02-22 18:29:18 Do you mean between brokerages? You can transfer stocks and bonds in-kind to a different TFSA account.
1824 2018-02-22 18:29:15 Getting rid of the bump stocks is important. But, what about metal detectors as people walk into the school. You only need two people to scan as people come in. How about more security cameras? Would someone have seen him easier that way.
1825 2018-02-22 18:29:04 Yet you allowed the vote to keep bump stocks to go though after the Vegas shooting. Congress has already said that they won't be upping the minimum age to purchase a gun. You also just cut funding for mental health programs. Sad. Keep spreading your lies.
1826 2018-02-22 18:28:52 Ok i agree on the bump stocks to some lentgh.ok raising the age makes a little  sense ,what about those members of  the  military that are not using it to kill but to collect them.
1827 2018-02-22 18:28:52 And I’m not saying that’s the only thing we should do. Bump stocks. Universal background checks. High capacity magazines. We have to do SOMETHING. We have to TRY.
1828 2018-02-22 18:28:38 Oh ffs!! You are a moron! FYI: Good people want thorough background checks, the AR-15 and bump stocks banned!! @NRA is a lobbying organization for gun manufacturers!!
1829 2018-02-22 18:28:35 Arming teachers wont work because when swat comes in they won't be able to tell if the teacher is the shooter or a victim.  That teacher with a weapon might be shot trying to protect people . Keep it simple just  band bump stocks and semi machine guns.
1830 2018-02-22 18:28:33 Drivers license: 3 months of training. Car Insurance: similar for guns. High capacity magazines gone. Bump stocks gone. Hold these gun owners liable if their guns are involved. NO more gun shows. See the rules for Japan on gun ownership!
1831 2018-02-22 18:28:18 This jackass is now talking about arming 20 year military retirees who have become teachers. (fantasy) Give them a "little bonus" for carrying a gun. There will NOT be a ban the sale of AR-15's, bump stocks, and no extensive background checks.
1832 2018-02-22 18:28:15 Yeah they are great people just like your white supremisists.
I hope you get your just rewards and Mueller stocks it to you big time.
1833 2018-02-22 18:28:09 Nobody with two brain cells to rub together wants more guns in our schools you oaf.  We need a ban on assault weapons. We need age to purchase raised.  We need to get rid of bump-stocks and other like devices.
1834 2018-02-22 18:28:02 If you truly want to take the offensive, then forget about wasting your time on finding teachers willing to undergo paramilitary training, and propose to Congress some sensible #GunReformNow. Through legislation, ban bump stocks and weapons of war, strengthen background checks.
1835 2018-02-22 18:27:58 You sit back and relax, so do I. But some people are more sensitive to this kind of information. And saying "I have information that someone is buying 25% at $.75" is just market manipulation if it turns out to be fake. If we were talking about stocks, this would be a crime.
1836 2018-02-22 18:27:50 Common sense reforms are clearly needed. Certain kinds of gun should be restricted to the military. Bump stocks are what rattled my brain. I had no idea they existed until Las Vegas. People need to pass a check & have a license if they want something more than sporting arms.
1837 2018-02-22 18:27:49 Agreed! Im glad Pres. Trump is working with DOJ and bypass Congress to get sensible background checks and ban bump stocks. Steps in the right direction
1838 2018-02-22 18:27:25 #LME #Copper found support at $7k mark & settled at session highs ($7162). Next resis the $7200 area, followed by $7253 high from last Fri.  Today saw LME Copper on-warrant stocks -3.5%, although still far from recent peak of 293kt registered on 9 Feb. 
#DeePerera #LondonClose
1839 2018-02-22 18:27:22 So what’s the solution?  I keep asking but I haven’t heard a decent one that will work. Trumps already looking at legislation to ban bump stocks which is a start.
1840 2018-02-22 18:27:21 I have plenty of rifles and I don’t use bump stocks. Not sure if that in itself would do him in but  ask yourself this: Trump is in his 70s today would he want to deal with these deranged lunatics for another 7 years? If re-elected he would be almost 80 years old when term ends.
1841 2018-02-22 18:27:06 The only problem is age. We don’t need bump stocks.  But 21?  I don’t see how an 18 year old can go to war, then return home and can’t buy a gun.
1842 2018-02-22 18:26:43 On Oct 17, 2017, Ohio Senate gets bill to ban the sale, possession of bump-fire stocks on guns
To date, it has yet to get even one hearing, says sponsor Cecil Thomas, a ex-policeman from Cincy.
"I implore all Ohioans to...change the tide of gun control legislation in this state"
1843 2018-02-22 18:26:41 Is she trying to joke about a life being taken ? After all we've seen, all the lives actually taken by bump stocks, automatic weapons, semi-automatic weapons - etc etc etc? Not funny but her husband is looking like a fool and his terrible proposals are being flushed down the loo.
1844 2018-02-22 18:26:40 If Trump caves to raising the minimum age limit for purchasing a firearm and banning bump stocks he will have lost my vote come 2020.
1845 2018-02-22 18:26:38 Stocks punked 
1846 2018-02-22 18:26:35 You know what we should do is slap sanctions on him, his money and his friends and fam. 

Also ban Intl investors from buying US govt owned co stocks and bonds. 

Then trump would defn change his tune, follow liberal agenda, and embrace Muslims and gays alike!
1847 2018-02-22 18:26:34 How do you propose to do so without banning assault rifles & bump stocks? Common sense indicates you stop the problem where it starts...military weapons in civilian hands. You won't because the NRA OWNS the GOP. Stop accepting NRA donations. You have blood on your hands. Shame!
1848 2018-02-22 18:26:26 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @RepScottTaylor YOU DO NOT WORK FOR THE NRA, YOU WORK FOR US.Ban Assault Rifles,Ban Bump Stocks, Raise to age nationwide to purchase guns to 21, STOP TAKING MONEY FROM THE NRA-they represent gun makers not their members, Pass universal background checks
1849 2018-02-22 18:26:24 "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," Winkler said. (Bump stocks legalization) Other legal experts stressed that it wasn’t an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn’t allow for its regulation.” PT1
1850 2018-02-22 18:26:18 Banning bump stocks & assault rifles to start. Pretty well known policy demands. I don’t have time to litigate this.
1851 2018-02-22 18:26:18 "During a bear market, stocks frequently open strong early in the morning and close weak by the end of the day. During bull markets, stocks tend to open down and come back later in the day to close up strongly."
1852 2018-02-22 18:26:02 #March4OurLives is for the Children of the USA. @realDonaldTrump you're going to have to give something up. Immediately ban bump stocks, AR15 ownership for anyone other than the military, law enforcement. Then this will show good Faith. The gun ain't my My God! @SenateGOP #NRA
1853 2018-02-22 18:25:53 "Stocks are rallying today on the same news which caused yesterday's selloff."

1855 2018-02-22 18:25:50 We can OWN guns, but why do we have to own ASSAULT rifles, hi-capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers, & why rail against a background check if they have nothing to hide, or reasonable age restriction? Teachers w/guns means they'll be targeted first.
1856 2018-02-22 18:25:47 No, AR’s are not called “assault rifles” because of bump stocks. They are called “assault rifles” because of the uninformed and the leftist media, that includes @FoxNews . Any instrument used in an assault is an assault weapon. They are just rifles!
1857 2018-02-22 18:25:46 #BREAKING: President Trump- "We're going to do strong background checks. We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18. We're getting rid of the bump stocks, and we're going to be focusing very strongly on mental health." #BreakingNews
1858 2018-02-22 18:25:24 That horse has def left the barn, we have the best military in human history, and our *militia* is going to beat them back with AR 15s with bump stocks. REALLY bad argument for 2nd amendment rights.

1863 2018-02-22 18:25:12 Right on cue @NRA "they are coming for your guns". Now watch prices go up, gun sales go up, gun stocks go up. 
WORKS EVERY TIME
1864 2018-02-22 18:25:03 I wonder if they would have signed off on the 2nd amendment if assault rifles w/ bump stocks existed. 

When they signed the 2nd amendment, it took 20 seconds to fire a musket. Now w/ ARs, ppl can fire 90-150 shots per minute.
1865 2018-02-22 18:24:59 @Snapchat your stocks dropped 7% in one night bc of this update. Fix it and go back to the old Snapchat. Stop being fucking stubborn. No one likes this update and we’ve been very vocal about it.
1866 2018-02-22 18:24:50 Background checks dont work.
When the FBI ignores multiple reports of  credible threats of violence, mentally illness is not the problem it is our DOJ! As far as bump stocks go NO ONE WAS EVER killed by a bump fire stock the Vegas shooter used REAL ILLEGALLY manufactured machine
1867 2018-02-22 18:24:35 Background checks can do some but not all. And bump stocks are pieces of fucking plastic, are we gonna ban 3D printers too? He gets sucked in by what he thinks is the mainstream take but thankfully normally back pedals from it.
1868 2018-02-22 18:24:30 Porn is Donnie’s middle name. He may say he wants bump stocks banned etc. but he plans on making sure none happens. He likes that NRA $31 mill. 1 thing I know 4 sure:  Donnie is a liar
1869 2018-02-22 18:24:29 You’re wrong. It was Obama’s Justice Department and ATF that made Bump Stocks legal. Even the evil NRA says they should be outlawed. #I’mNot Russian
1870 2018-02-22 18:24:21 I could care less about bump stocks, they don't work well and it was the Obama administration that okayed them.

1872 2018-02-22 18:24:10 U know traders short the sentimentally weak stocks. Nervousness created by media & jokes cracked by twitter celebs will make innocent investors sell in panic. As u said it's better to wait or search for wrong doing. If no wrong found , shud hold or buy. That's how value is found.
1873 2018-02-22 18:23:58 @bbcnews. Check your facts about gun control measures re checks and bump stocks. These are NRA approved ideas.

1875 2018-02-22 18:23:50 I agree with that. Now ban assault rifles, automatic weapons and bump stocks.
1876 2018-02-22 18:23:39 END THE SALE OF ASSAULT WEAPONS, NOT JUST BUMP STOCKS- NOT PROTECTED BY THE 2ND
1877 2018-02-22 18:23:34 Two genuine questions from a lefty (me): 

1. Why do civilians NEED a semi-automatic weapon?

2. Why would civilians NEED mods like bump stocks?

Can you hunt with these items? Or is this purely for hobby?
1878 2018-02-22 18:23:23 Control the sale and use of ammunition.  Stop internet sales of guns and ammunition. Stop private sales without background checks. Stop gun sales to wanted felons, mental patients and people on No-Fly list. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and other similar accessories.
1879 2018-02-22 18:23:21 They dead ass gotta change it back now  2018 is crazy  RT @Crym89s: Kyle Jenner moving stocks. 
1880 2018-02-22 18:23:20 We now enter the world of “influencers” impacting publicly traded stocks with the very real potential of monetary gain through stock manipulation. #audit

1882 2018-02-22 18:23:11 I keep my deceased father's handgun in my home for protection (no children live in the home) and I firmly believe in strict gun control laws.  No one needs an assault rifle, bump stocks, or any of that nonsense.
1883 2018-02-22 18:23:07 I am curious. Besides Rain, Graphite and HEG how many other stocks you have.
1884 2018-02-22 18:23:05 Bump stocks and semi automatic weapons were banned in Australia after a massacre of 35 people, the very next day .  Now they have no massacres.  We should do the same. Children are worth more than these guns. Just ban these guns.
1885 2018-02-22 18:23:05 Background checks are OK. Bump stocks were unknown until Obama made them legal. Raising the age to 21 is bad. The age of majority is 18.
1886 2018-02-22 18:23:01 Making bump stocks illegal is the same as what has been done with knives. A slew of pointless regulation based on arbitrary bull shit.
The rest sounds good - certainly more than others have ACTUALLY done.
1887 2018-02-22 18:23:00 WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT AFTER VEGAS? Now everyone is loading up on bump stocks. Not very smart tactic.
1888 2018-02-22 18:22:54 I don't have a problem arming teachers. But that can't be the ONLY solution. Get rid of bump stocks,high capacity magazines and assault rifles. Make it harder to buy a gun. Treat mental illness with the respect and care that it deserves. Make schools hard to get into
1889 2018-02-22 18:22:45 Here’s what needs to happen: 

-Raise Rifle age from 18-21
-Ban the sale Bump Stocks 
-Allow Teachers and Coaches who are properly trained and/or veterans to arm in school.
1890 2018-02-22 18:22:36 That’s BS. Banning assault rifles and bump stocks does not make anyone less free. It’s the nuts in the NRA that want to get people upset.
1891 2018-02-22 18:22:32 We need to ban binary triggers and cam fire systems too.  They are more dangerous than bump stocks
1892 2018-02-22 18:22:21 I do not advocate doing away with #2ndAmendment or making gun or rifle ownership illegal. The assault rifle and gun stocks kill are made to kill people. The army should have them (#ArmedForces ). The NRA gets much money (from #kickbackfromgunsales from gun industry.
1893 2018-02-22 18:22:21 gun control laws will not solve this...if you pass pro democrat laws you lose my support & millions more...we need laws that give American citizens the freedom to open carry and remove ALL  gun free zones. Age 21 is in Chicago, what goods it doing? NONE...bump stocks irrelevant
1894 2018-02-22 18:22:09 30-06 and 870.
________________<<< We are here.
Bump stocks are retarded. Let Trump ban them. I pass background checks, and im over 21 who cares. Private sales are a rip off anyway.
Nobody needs 30 rounds. 
Detachable magazines are the new bump stocks.
Well, semi autos should
1895 2018-02-22 18:22:04 I will credit him for asking for background checks, the ban of bump stocks (a red herring though as the ban of certain weapons would eliminate need for bump stocks) and raising purchase age to 21.
1896 2018-02-22 18:21:56 You can see how stocks is influenced by trends when Snapchat stocks plummet after Kylie Jenner tweeted about it dying..
1897 2018-02-22 18:21:53 You might get bump stocks (pointless because they’re easily DYI) but the rest? The government can’t effectively manage  immigration, the VA, illicit drugs, the national debt, or social security, but we think they’re going to stop every wacko in the country getting a gun?
1898 2018-02-22 18:21:48 My beliefs concur with the woman who states do not legislate bump stocks. My right to defend my country from tyrants shall not be infringed.
1899 2018-02-22 18:21:43 Are you ok? This is a discussion about bump stocks, not taking guns away. Calm down and read the thread before you give yourself a heart attack.
1900 2018-02-22 18:21:41 The best is already over... These stocks can only go one way now... Imagine that these itsy bitsy companies are making more money and have larger market cap than their end customers....
1901 2018-02-22 18:21:30 Bump stocks just soften the Recoil of the WEAPON not make it Fire Faster! JUST easyer on the shoulder!
1902 2018-02-22 18:21:12 You can start by not letting them legislate me & my fellow teachers into having to carry guns. You can continue by sponsoring legislation to ban high-capacity magazines & bump stocks so that I don't have to try to figure out how to stop bullets while teaching critical thinking.
1903 2018-02-22 18:20:59 Wow you’re a loon. Our forefathers didn’t have bump stocks. Literally no reason to have one. Goodness.
1904 2018-02-22 18:20:44 What is more important bump stocks and semi automatic weapons or lives? You have the right to bear arms but not the right to every weapon under creation. Nobody needs military type guns but the military.
1905 2018-02-22 18:20:38 Why did you start with a 302 beginning stocks number when USDA is at 530 and its probably going up?
1906 2018-02-22 18:20:35 Banning bump stocks is only the begging of more of your communist insanity.
1907 2018-02-22 18:20:24 Read more.
IN 2010 the ATF determined that they could not regulate bump stocks because they didn't change the mechanism of the weapon. They were an accessory.
The ATF's ability to regulate such new implements has been hamstrung by LAWS pass by the Congress & advocated by the NRA.
1908 2018-02-22 18:20:08 Only the majority of shotguns and maybe handguns used by narco cartels come from USA. Most of everything else- from AKs, ARs, machine guns, sniper rifles are either bought from overseas or come from stocks of local military forces. Also they now make a good deal of them in-house.
1909 2018-02-22 18:19:55 > just type bump stocks into youtube

You grossly underestimate my laziness and uncaringness. :-D
1910 2018-02-22 18:19:52 There's not very many people in the gun community that had heard about bump stocks, until all of the BS came out about it.
1911 2018-02-22 18:19:47 Yep. NRA, Executive VP Wayne LaPierre & firearms manufacturers cannot get enough AK-15s w/bump stocks sold. Money, money, .
1912 2018-02-22 18:19:40 “President Donald Trump went his furthest in advocating more control over gun sales on Thursday, saying he will push tougher background checks that screen for mental health, raising the minimum age of buyers to 21, and ending the sale of bump stocks.”
Thank you 
1913 2018-02-22 18:19:31 This said I do believe people should have access to weapons that are NOT Semi Automatic or Automatic. I don’t think they should have access to high volume mags of any kind, stripper clips, bump stocks, modification kits ect.
1914 2018-02-22 18:19:29 You might get bump stocks (pointless because they’re easily DYI) but the rest? The government can’t effectively manage  immigration, the VA, illicit drugs, the national debt, or social security, but we think they’re going to keep every wacko in the country getting a gun?
1915 2018-02-22 18:19:19 that bump stocks should be banned and Trump is going to do it, if people just let him. This is about safety.
1916 2018-02-22 18:19:10 @wolfblitzer  What happened to you? It has been 6 months since @GOP and the @president said they would take bump-stocks off the market. You give a pass. 
Why not ask how many children have been slaughtered by machine guns since they were banned?
1917 2018-02-22 18:19:02 Have you ever used a bump stock? Have you ever held a bump stock? Could you identify a rifle with bump stock?  Can you tell me why the military doesn’t use bump stocks? Can you tell me why semi-auto fire is preferable to full auto? 5 simple questions.
1918 2018-02-22 18:18:58 @realDonaldTrump sorry mr President I fully support you but your wrong on bump stocks we the people have the right to defend our selves even it’s against our own government
1919 2018-02-22 18:18:21 I support you 100% Mr President. I am so proud of you. Personally, I don’t want to open the door to other prohibitions by emphasizing Bump Stocks. However, I accept that you will do the very best you can do to protect our freedoms in this environment and protect our kids, too!
1920 2018-02-22 18:18:06 society where they don't have to deal with mass shootings. Besides I agree with banning bump stocks. Both Democrats and Republicans agree
1921 2018-02-22 18:18:04 Ban the AR-15. Ban bump stocks. That is a start. More guns is not the answer.
1922 2018-02-22 18:17:57 What is a gun used for? Hunting, home protection, sport or killing. I think all can be accomplished without bump stocks, 30 round to 100 round drum mags don’t you?
1923 2018-02-22 18:17:56 Quit giving Republicans lawmakers kudos for being disgusting human beings, because they toss you a bone about bump stocks...
1924 2018-02-22 18:17:39 FANG stocks are all red now, possible catch up selloff to come.
1925 2018-02-22 18:17:37 I don't give a shit about bump stocks. It's a useless novelty, waste of ammo and is good for nothing but having fun. Once. At a shooting range. It's like invading Iraq after people from Afghanistan take down the wtc. It makes zero sense and will not save anyone, it wasn't involvd
1926 2018-02-22 18:17:28 Sometimes market knows what we don't know. Why is PCJ share falling continuously despite management clarifications while other jewellary stocks r still trying to hold? Market may be wrong. Time will tell.
1927 2018-02-22 18:17:13 I assume  mackerel is the main stock in red column for coastal states. Mackerel has been fished in excess  of @ICES_ASC  advice over several yr & yet still it has expanded  in volome & range. Concept of MSY 4 major stocks needs 2 cater 4 ecosystem effects & carrying capacity.
1928 2018-02-22 18:17:03 Does the increase of Yuan could make the Chinese gov buy $ and treasuries (again)... which in turn put a stop on the 10Y pressure and therefore the stocks market ?!
#DowJones #dow #SP500
1929 2018-02-22 18:17:03 lol  you’re an idiot! So... let’s just pretend you have a point... so what? What are you going to do about bump stocks now that normal non crazy people know about them and what they do? Shut up or put up!
1930 2018-02-22 18:16:59 I can help with the stocks....what u wanna know?
1931 2018-02-22 18:16:59 If stocks close in the red today, or severely below highs, it will mark the 3rd day we open higher & lose steam by the close. Dip buyers would be striking out essentially. $SPY
1932 2018-02-22 18:16:48 Banning bump stocks does nothing when you can simulate using one using your own clothes. This is paying lip service. Don't buy into it!
1933 2018-02-22 18:16:46 As long as the military has FULLY automatic weapons, citizens should be allowed bump stocks. Our 2nd amendment right is to protect us from tyrannical government, as well as all enemy's of AMERICA. "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED" IS EVERYONE'S RIGHT!
1934 2018-02-22 18:16:37 Nothing in our Constitution says you have a right to bump stocks. Less people would have been killed in Vegas!
1935 2018-02-22 18:16:16 Collapsable stocks allow you to fit the stock to your arm length.
1936 2018-02-22 18:16:14 Unclear about his calculations but what he missed for sure is that RP funds have a quarter to a third of risk in inflation sensitive assets. The portfolio he stressed is only stocks and nominal bonds
1937 2018-02-22 18:16:11 Bump stocks are not mentioned in the Constitution and if they are made illegal it won't be your right to own one. Get over it.
1938 2018-02-22 18:16:10 Not talking about bump stocks. Talking about databases.
1939 2018-02-22 18:15:55 Wasn’t talking about you, just trump haters in general. I know you’re wise enough to support a policy that you agree with regardless of who is in charge. Trump already directed Sessions to ban bump stocks. I think that should be evidence enough that he’s at least gonna try.
1940 2018-02-22 18:15:50 We aren’t talking about guns - we’re talking about bump stocks. Legal, same as abortions. When questioned why Anna needs them she said it’s her right, legal right - same as my legal right to an abortion. Keep up.
1941 2018-02-22 18:15:37 Clearly not working. Need to start with banning gun silencers, bump stocks and cracking down on background checks. Also NRA has far too much sway
1942 2018-02-22 18:15:36 @POTUS Targeting bump-stocks and gun laws is not the solution. This country is in shambles and has many internal problems that need to be dealt with. You know the real problems. Fix those instead.
1943 2018-02-22 18:15:25 The NRA has long externalized the true cost of guns to the taxpayer. As we begin the ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, and some ammunition, can we also take a look at ways to make the externalization stop? Wouldn't requiring insurance at point of sale be circumspect?
1944 2018-02-22 18:15:23 Guess I missed the part of the Constitution that says there is a “right to bump stocks.”
1945 2018-02-22 18:15:17 I don't recall the Second Amendment addressing "bump stocks," it says "arms" not "accessories."
1946 2018-02-22 18:14:54 We’re just splitting hairs here between full and semi auto. Especially with how easily converted the AR15 can ACTUALLY  and EFFECTIVELY be converted. There is a little known way to convert that for approximately $6 and in less than 5 minutes in the right hands. Or BUMP STOCKS HMM
1947 2018-02-22 18:14:50 Don't give up an inch @realDonaldTrump No bans, leave bump stocks alone, get rid of gun free zones, arm teachers and hire security. Simple as that. Just like electricity, active shooters follow the path of least resistance.
1948 2018-02-22 18:14:36 I don't think he lost his base. Not for banning bump stocks. There are so many other ways on doing the same thing. You just have to get more training.
1949 2018-02-22 18:14:33 Ban bump stocks! Here's an idea! How about banning guns? Other countries do and are not afraid! We seem like a nation of cowards because we have to hide behind a gun. It is out of control. Lawmakers are out of their minds as they are gutless wonders. Scared of the NRA!
1950 2018-02-22 18:14:32 The rate of fire is no better or faster than a typical handgun. Its still up to the skill of the user. Some would argue a handgun is better for close quarters action as well. I'm with you on limiting access to bump stocks however. And ready access to info to modify most rifles
1951 2018-02-22 18:14:31 Let’s go!
1952 2018-02-22 18:14:25 Either to be honest. Although bump stocks seem pretty common.... Well anyway  I guess you have already solved the problem 
1953 2018-02-22 18:14:24 Wifey downloaded an app on my phone called @stockpile a while back & I invested & check my stocks everyday now
1954 2018-02-22 18:14:18 After Vegas that was a clear opportunity to vote on bump stocks. The bill was created and then never mentioned until now. The responsibility is on the hands of the GOP.
1955 2018-02-22 18:14:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1956 2018-02-22 18:14:08 What questions I got about stocks?
1957 2018-02-22 18:14:07 the kid in front of me in stats is shopping for bump stocks.
1958 2018-02-22 18:13:57 For those who are new to market corrections, cut your equity (direct) exposure, preferably not so great companies. Invest through SIP in great companies /or good equity mutual funds. Don't get distracted by market volatility. Learn to buy on convictions and stay invested.#stocks
1959 2018-02-22 18:13:44 Multiple steps have to be taken into account in order to prevent mass shootings. Gun violence research should be funded, mental health care/screening must be improved, thorough background checks implemented, ban bump stocks, large capacity mags & assault rifles.
1960 2018-02-22 18:13:15 $ABX $GG these r best shit stocks and don’t waste ur time. They don’t follow gold prices and etfs control these guys $gdx $GDXJ
1961 2018-02-22 18:13:10 I am very pro-2A, but touche. Bump stocks should not be a protected accessory. And i see no real practical need. In a compromise, you have to give somewhere, and I think this is something we can give on.
1962 2018-02-22 18:12:57 Trump tries to claim success before he’s done anything to stop massacres in America. When this Congress FAILS TO DO ANYTHING AGAIN BECAUSE THE BLOODY NRA OWNS THE GOP TRUMP WILL BLAME EVERYONE ELSE FOR HIS FAILURE. Ending bump stocks is not enough. #EndNRA #RESIST
1963 2018-02-22 18:12:26 easy to control a sector of stocks when all you have to do is buy and sell an etf. imagine where the market and stocks would be if the etf money were in the individual stocks... control baby control
1964 2018-02-22 18:12:07 i believe in the 2nd amendment. i want to have a gun to protect my family. i do want to ban all asault weapons, bump stocks and magazines that hold more than 5 bullets. get it done now.
1965 2018-02-22 18:12:05 im for raising the age to buy, but to ban an accessory to a firearm will allow them to ban other addons like adjustable triggers, different stocks that allow the arms to fit the user, bipods,scopes... i am afraid that it will cause a vacuum of abolitionists to destroy the 2nd A.
1966 2018-02-22 18:12:01 On Varney & Co., @ToddRokitaIN refused to support Trump's calls for background checks, raising the age to 21, and banning bump stocks. #INSen
1967 2018-02-22 18:12:00 Incorrect.  His weapons were not military they were civilian AR style weapons whiched functioned in semiautomatic fashion.  He used a modification called bump stocks which uses the rifles recoil to fire at a faster semi auto rate.  Weapons were still semi auto.

1969 2018-02-22 18:11:44 I watch CNN last night with their town hall meeting. And then the next morning media recording that the lawmakers are asking NRA if it's okay to raise the age from 18 to 21 and stopping bump stocks 4 guns.

1971 2018-02-22 18:11:26 TBH though bump stocks are fucking ridiculous
1972 2018-02-22 18:11:22 Because banning bump stocks makes a gun less lethal. Wrong move
1973 2018-02-22 18:11:19 Goodness sakes! In the last week this dude has been everywhere and back already.  even when Trump takes steps against bump stocks it’s not good enough. Just going back and reading his consecutive tweets this week he has contradicted himself so many times it’s not even funny.
1974 2018-02-22 18:11:15 I greatly admire the courageous Parkland students. Open discussion on how to end mass shootings essential. @realdonaldtrump needs to listen, absorb, and act. Stronger background checks, ban on bump stocks & assault weapons, and better ability to identify warning signs are key.
1975 2018-02-22 18:11:15 @DLoesch Ur answer should have been, yes, the approval process for obtaining a weapon should be followed explicitly & bump stocks do not make a gun an automatic-firing weapon. U answered politically about a subject that required a long explanation, poor debate technique .#NRA
1976 2018-02-22 18:11:14 Bump stocks will be going on fire sale soon...each one will come with a can of Axe body spray, a camo patch hat and your choice of a Luke Bryan or Florida-Georgia Line CD. #bumpstocks #realshootersdontwantthem

1978 2018-02-22 18:10:42 Stricter and lengthy background checks. Fed registration for all states not just some. Close the loopholes for private/gunshow sales. Ban on bump stocks and high capacity magazines. a ban on future sales of assault weapons with a possible confiscation of ones in circulation.
1979 2018-02-22 18:10:39 Bump stocks weren't used in vegas, nor in Florida and not anywhere. I don't give a shit about bump stocks but what do you think your doing by banning them? You're smarter than this.
1980 2018-02-22 18:10:29 No doubt because of the weighting of energy stocks but for now we are a resource economy. Eco activists will rejoice but the trickle down affect will impact other sectors, pensions etc. We need pipelines.
1981 2018-02-22 18:10:17 How many kids does it take to die BEFORE ppl are comfortable with a ban on bump stocks. 100? 1000? How many?
1982 2018-02-22 18:10:16 Mental health checks, better background checks, age restrictions, banning bump stocks. Now you're getting somewhere, Mr President. @POTUS #GunReformNow #IsItTimeYet
1983 2018-02-22 18:10:16 Obama regime allowed the selling of bump stocks
1984 2018-02-22 18:10:16 His Administration can’t ban bump stocks, congress has too…
1985 2018-02-22 18:09:57 I love my guns but bump stocks are 100% useless i dont see a big deal about banning them. Even Automatic guns dont help you in any way
1986 2018-02-22 18:09:47 A widely used indicator in technical analysis is the moving average. It is a lagging indicator bc it's based on past prices, but it helps to smooth out the price action bc it filters out random price fluctuations #stocks #markets #TechnicalAnalysis
1987 2018-02-22 18:09:42 You beat me to it. Obama deregulated bump stocks but restricted mentally unstable from getting access to guns.
1988 2018-02-22 18:09:29 People are being blindsided by Politicians, Preaches, Black Panther, Black Chyna and Bump Stocks
1989 2018-02-22 18:09:21 Bump stocks do make them pretty close to Automatic if you want that kind of weapon it is your right so get a class A weapons license then you can legally own a M-16 no need for a bump stock
1990 2018-02-22 18:09:13 I only want you to recommend stocks that go up, m'kay?
1991 2018-02-22 18:09:10 I don't care if they ban bump stocks or  "assault" rifles, a full ban will never happen or a repeal of the 2nd A. I only like pointing out the flaws and Hypocracy of liberals views. Soon the people of Cali and Chi will get tired of blood and human waste covering their streets.

1994 2018-02-22 18:08:33 Regardless, the argument is that these laws are dangerous to the average American. Like so many other laws, these "bump stock" regulations are poorly written, and can be easily broken accidently by completely innocent people. They solve nothing, anyone can diy bump stocks
1995 2018-02-22 18:08:33 Not 100% sure why bump stocks were legal to begin with
1996 2018-02-22 18:08:28 the stance is how it sits and looks.  Some builds look great with a classic wood stock.  Some builds look great with modern stocks.  its a personal preference, same with the color.  Wood or plastic, they affect the look, not the operation of the rifle.
1997 2018-02-22 18:08:27 Stocks in the town centre before he starts his prison sentence (unlikely). Could think of a few items l would like to smack him with. So hope the young girl will be OK.
1998 2018-02-22 18:08:11 The pistol grip makes for much better ergonomics for the shooter than can be achieved within the limits of old-fashioned wooden stocks.
1999 2018-02-22 18:08:08 Which ones have converted their semi-automatic weapons to fully automatic?  I'm not aware of any.  The closest was the LV shooter who used a bump stock which is not efficient and most people were ok with banning bump stocks as they are mostly useless to begin with.
2000 2018-02-22 18:08:07 Training yes, bg checks already exist, the age limit is 21 for handguns, which are used as much, and ban on bump stocks is fine and started working it's way to the presidents desk science dec.
2001 2018-02-22 18:08:02 Stiffer background checks, ban bump stocks, major increase in mental health checks.....

Start there...... Just sayin
2002 2018-02-22 18:08:00 The problem with age limits is that once we are distracted enough by age, mental health, bump stocks, armed teachers  angry Instagram posts, we still have AR15s for sport fun.
2003 2018-02-22 18:07:59 That won’t happen, hahahahahahahah. Banning bump stocks is good though
2004 2018-02-22 18:07:55 Ar stands for ArmaLite rifle, but because it is a semi automatic rifle that can be turned into a automatic rifle because of bump stocks, it recieve the nickname "assault rifle" a semi mean you can shoot a bullet with every pull of the trigger but bump stocks are legal

2006 2018-02-22 18:07:47 “A large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting” - think about what you are saying - banning bump stocks and raising the age is a good start, I will give you that. Why kill the momentum with such a ridiculous statement?
2007 2018-02-22 18:07:28 @realDonaldTrump no new laws, bump stocks do nothing but make it harder to aim; focus on hardening shools and securing the facility
2008 2018-02-22 18:07:00 "I don't think we can discount any solution..."
Cool... So let's: Study guns use (banned by Congress since 96). Ban bump stocks & extended mags. Universal background checks on all gun sales. Disallow gun sales to people on terrorist watch list, mentally ill,  domestic abusers
2009 2018-02-22 18:06:59 I have seen bad days for Markets....! But never so bad days for fundamentally strong stocks....!! Looks like #AccheDin are here.
2010 2018-02-22 18:06:55 Baloney. It is a hugh problem that needs to be fixed now. Most Americans and hunters agree on a ban on assault weapons, BUMP stocks, mental health background checks. The NRA should lose on these issues. The status quo is not working.
2011 2018-02-22 18:06:54 @CarlPrinetweets the debate some make comparing the Ruger Mini 14 ranch rifle vs. the AR got me thinking about this.

10 rounds seems reasonable to me for civilians. I know this is just another baby step. Along with raising age to 21 and no bump stocks.
2012 2018-02-22 18:06:52 Months late on bump stocks. As to mental health, it starts at home, Don.

2015 2018-02-22 18:06:22 A
1. Put an end to Gun Free Zones that involve schools.                    
2. Permit teachers / coaches who want to carry to do so with appropriate training
3. Raise legal age to own guns to 21
4. Bump stocks illegal
5. Institute appropriate checks when purchasing guns
2016 2018-02-22 18:06:19 More came out of it than that. Banning bump stocks, tightening background checks and examining the mental health component. Vague on specifics at the time, but at least starting a constructive dialogue instead of airing a show where ppl just screech at each other.
2017 2018-02-22 18:06:17 Yes the doj has no authority to write laws they have the authority to carry out laws on the books and they should be not writing a new law regarding bump stocks at all it's not their place and it's actually illegal
2018 2018-02-22 18:05:53 Ban ALL assault weapons, bump stocks, extended clips, background for ALL FIREARM & AMMO purchase, no fly-no buy, mental illness=no firearms
2019 2018-02-22 18:05:48 looks at portfolio directly after buying stocks and is surprised when i see the market has not changed in those few seconds
2020 2018-02-22 18:05:48 What you’re suggesting is unrealistic. My point is that either is expensive but one is better. You can’t confiscate already owned guns.  Regulations on magazine size, bump stocks, tracking large amo purchases, things like that make more sense. Do you own a gun?
2021 2018-02-22 18:05:35 $PLSB... Keep them bids coimng, triple zero stocks have been running... Could PLSB run next??? Stay tuned...
2022 2018-02-22 18:05:28 One of the few compromises to start r to ban all bump stocks and any powerful weapon-like the AR-15. We don’t need these in our communities, they belong in the military & they should remain there. I’m against from complete ban of all guns, just no need for the semiautomatic ones.

2027 2018-02-22 18:04:35 Trump's arms crossed as soon as he addressed enhanced background checks, raising age limit, banning bump stocks. Then goes on to talk how mental institutions should come back. He said we used to have so many & now they're gone. We'll work on getting one open for you right away.

It's past time to bring this assault weapons ban (bump stocks too) to the floor for a vote. Let all Americans see that you are taking steps to save our children from being murdered at school. You represent students too. Prove that.
2030 2018-02-22 18:03:56 At midday, MBS holding gains. Stocks surging. 10-yr T Note 2.91%.
2031 2018-02-22 18:03:46 If you ban bump stocks or anything,we will vote you out!You won't get any political points.Not even Obama gave us any gun control laws, why would you?You are still not gonna solve anything.Arm the teachers.Won't see school shootings  in Utah,they would shoot back@realDonaldTrump
2032 2018-02-22 18:03:45 Sorry, we’re not turning schools into prisons. Instead, we’re gonna solve America’s gun pathology systematically starting with bump stocks, high capacity ammo, and a new assault weapons ban and then continuing with midterm elections.
2033 2018-02-22 18:03:37 It is time for the NRA to Step Down - NO Bump Stocks - YES Assualt Rifle Ban - NO to mega clips. These weapons are being used to mass murder our children every MONTH #NRA #NRABloodMoney
2034 2018-02-22 18:03:33 What do u mean told no on background checks? I'm a cop and I still have to have (and pay for) background check, each time I purchase a gun. No one ever heard of bump stocks till Vegas, now the Trump says he wants them banned. Obama's the one who did all the talking and no action.
2035 2018-02-22 18:03:17 I agree, but at least it's a reasonable starting point to a discussion. Not a "let's ban ARs because they look scary". The mental health angle is the one they need to focus on the most, and just make bump stocks as hard to get as suppressors.
2036 2018-02-22 18:03:04 keep defending death & destruction. Like I said people's minds & hearts are changing. They see their children dying needlessly & they will get rid of you bump stocks & semi automatic guns come hell or high water.  Your reign of terror will be over.  Sad U defend children killers.
2037 2018-02-22 18:02:55 Did we expect a credible solution from this reality TV shitshow?  I’m a gun owner (9 mm, 45, & 22) who supports a ban on bump stocks & military-style assault weapons. These weapons shouldn’t be in the hands of the general population and certainly not 18 yr olds. #GunLawsNOW
2038 2018-02-22 18:02:53 Plenty of solutions, arm teachers, locked school door control entering, outlaw bump stocks, back ground checks, enforce laws that are on the books stop the political correctness and I can keep going
2039 2018-02-22 18:02:41 I agree with you that bump stocks and other modifications should go. But if we dont cure the real issue there will be other avenues for them to attack.

2041 2018-02-22 18:02:10 It will be interesting to see if @realDonaldTrump mentions stronger background checks, banning bump stocks, and raising age for rifle purchase to 21 in his speech to C-PAC.
2042 2018-02-22 18:01:55 @lunatictrader1 Just signed up for your reversallevels. Had a question: if i want to get into several stocks that are already in buy signal state, what would be the best way to do so? Should I await a pullback? Thx
2043 2018-02-22 18:01:52 Bump stocks dont shoot the bullets the AR 15 shoots the bullets ,bump stocks just helps in shooting more people !!
2044 2018-02-22 18:01:46 He's going to allow responsible teachers to carry a firearm. He's increasing the legal age to purchase a rifle to 21, he's banning bump stocks and he's going to work with Congress to improve schools security.
That's going to work better than all those gun free Zone signs
2045 2018-02-22 18:01:41 Bot. Lol! This movement against guns was started by kids from a perdominatly Republican state who’s school was involved in a mass shooting.  It’s about eliminating semi automatic weapons and bump stocks not to take away all guns. 
2046 2018-02-22 18:01:39 the market algos are not supporting everything, bulls need to be selective, over time only 2 teams (stocks) make it to the superbowl
2047 2018-02-22 18:01:28 @JChatterleyBBG I have a question.  Is it possible to see how movie production stocks ($SNE, $DIS, etc)  are acting from 1 PM ET to current?  Trump stated he was concerned about violence in movies and is thinking out loud something should be done about that.  #Thankyou
2048 2018-02-22 18:01:01 The slippery slope of letting every nutter buy semi-autos w/ bump stocks and banana clips created the current problem. What's a the bottom of your slippery slope? Safe schools?
2049 2018-02-22 18:00:44 So my math teacher is having us to astock market game, and I just bought some random places, one was twitter and I bought 240 stocks. So now I’ve been in first place off all the people in my class including my teacher... so I guess I’m doing good lol
2050 2018-02-22 18:00:41 @realDonaldTrump Bump fire stocks don't turn guns fully automatic. Turning guns fully automatic is already illegal.  You can bump fire with your belt or a sharpie. Your proposal would ban fingers, you are not a gun guy. Talk to real gun people and learn. Don't be ignorant.
2051 2018-02-22 18:00:40 When I was a security officer I was one of few who did not own guns. Asked about bump stocks my fellow officers agreed they were a stupid, wildly inaccurate waste of ammo. OBTW be happy the US military does not actually use the ARmalite 15 rifle. It is not a "weapon of war."
2052 2018-02-22 18:00:37 The pistol grip stock is what makes the rifle an assault tool. It allows novice shooters to get minimal accuracy gains without training. It changes this tool from a precision hunting instrument into a mass casualty assault weapon.

Straight stocks limit the functionality a ton.
2053 2018-02-22 18:00:36 But the FTSE 100 and 250 are not reliable indicators because most of the companies are global. UK-based stocks have been under-performing.
2054 2018-02-22 18:00:30 The 1994 AWB didn't even ban ARs.

It only banned guns with certain combinations of cosmetic features like pistol grips, threaded barrels, and collapsible stocks.
2055 2018-02-22 18:00:29 Gee, the NRA is willing to let @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks and make some minor changes to gun laws.  Big steps.  Let’s see if Trump can even follow through on these. #GunContolNow
2056 2018-02-22 18:00:27 Maybe you should do your history Anna.  And while bump stocks dont make them machine guns, it does change it to a rapid fire weapon and you know that is true.  Stop deflecting.
2057 2018-02-22 18:00:26 The only change that should be made is completely banning bump stocks, and either making AR-15s much harder to get or banning them as well.
2058 2018-02-22 18:00:26 Good job!  Yes, this is what the people want... Thanks for listening!  Common sense gun laws... In favor of 2nd but, military type guns don't need to be available to the public.  A good first start.. 21 yr old & no Bump Stocks! Mental health facilities reopened... Yes... Thanks!!
2059 2018-02-22 18:00:22  Tomorrow morning is "Fruity Friday" at London Bridge from 08:15 and "Free fruit for your commute" day at Ebbsfleet from 07:30. Whilst stocks last. Be sure to pick up your fruit 
2060 2018-02-22 18:00:22 RepStevenSmith - Aren’t you the greedy lover of money more than children’s lives generation? Las Vegas shooter used bump stocks (you know the devices that Dems tried to ban butt Reps blocked?) to make his weapons automatic? Keep taking blood money. Your closet in Hell is ready.
2061 2018-02-22 18:00:08 @browardsheriff , Sheriff Scott Israel, Thank You for your participation in Town Hall Meeting last night. I am asking YOU, Who & Why do People buy Assult Rifles? Not used in hunting animals, for meat I am sure. I am for Assult Rifles to Law Enforc. & Military ONLY. NO Bump Stocks
2062 2018-02-22 18:00:07 stocks are pretty dumb, right???? Like y u wanna own a broken piece of a shitty corporation when u could own a beanie baby????
2063 2018-02-22 18:00:05 THE ONLY ANSWER IS TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS BUMP STOCKS etc. ...ENOUGH
2064 2018-02-22 18:00:02 You ever wonder why the Democrats who had 60 votes in the Senate, control of the House and Barack Obama in the White House, did not even take up banning the AR-15, bump stocks, or stricter background checks?
2065 2018-02-22 17:59:48 You need to look back in history and learn the purpose of the 2nd Amendment. Bump stocks aren't included.
2066 2018-02-22 17:59:37 Trump’s Best People are always the worst for their role:
Perry- Close DOE
Pruitt- Sued EPA
Puzder- Fought labor rules for workers
Sessions- Voter suppression 
Price- Trade health stocks
Flynn- Foreign agent
Putin- Joint Cyber Security lead

NRA? Yeah, take the lead on #GunControl
2067 2018-02-22 17:59:36 Dude, stop. Bump stocks are tactically hindering and if you're old enough to vote, you should be able to buy a gun. Cruz stole that rifle, so background checks are not relevant either
2068 2018-02-22 17:59:29 This is also ridiculous.  You aren't giving someone the right to CHOOSE to own certain things.  You CHOOSE not to murder an unborn baby, even though you are allowed to do so, and you use that as a parallel to bump stocks?  You're wrong.
2069 2018-02-22 17:59:29 You’re wrong Mr. Smith you’re completely wrong he didn’t approve bump stocks get your facts straight and stop besmirching one of the best presidents ever
2070 2018-02-22 17:59:28 Valid points. However within the past week look at the Lefts reaction to Trumps proposal on banning bump stock. An objective, centered person would say “great, he’s compromising, non-partisan.” Instead MSM says “parkland shooter didn’t use bump stocks” no concession will beenough
2071 2018-02-22 17:59:25 The age limit I can see where that is basically irrelevant, but why do you disagree with the bump stocks? Why does one necessarily need it?
2072 2018-02-22 17:59:23 Some market watchers believe Nike and J.P. Morgan are the two Dow stocks to buy.
2073 2018-02-22 17:59:12 How is it your right? The second amendment says nothing about bump stocks. They weren't even invented at that time. Not every weapon or enhancement falls under the purview of the 2nd Amendment - that's just false.
2074 2018-02-22 17:59:09 Bump stocks, raising the age, and serious background checks is a start though. Not the answer but a step in the right direction.
2075 2018-02-22 17:59:04 BUMP STOCKS.  Get rid of them. and YES I AM an ardent NRA member.  Bump Stocks are totally unnecessary.
2076 2018-02-22 17:59:02 Not to mention the staggering dumbfuckery of inventing and selling pointlessly huge magazines and Rube Goldberg buttstocks of questionable legality (BATFE tried to take bump-fire stocks off the market for years) with NO questions asked.
2077 2018-02-22 17:58:49 Be careful with the Bump stocks. It’s a slippery slope. Please don’t become a president that wants to allow rights that fit the agamda. That would make you a Democrat. Bump stocks didn’t kill kids. The deaths in shootings are the fault of the people holding the gun. Not the gun.
2078 2018-02-22 17:58:45 I don't want a bump stocks,  I want a belt fed .50 cal
2079 2018-02-22 17:58:43 So Trump wants to increase the digging on background checks with emphasis on mental illness and ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21 but that’s not good enough for you? What more do you want?
2080 2018-02-22 17:58:39 Trump blames Muslims for terrorism, so raises an instant travel ban.
Trump admits bump stocks could be a problem, so talks about legislation that may, in a few years time, ban them if we are lucky.
2081 2018-02-22 17:58:34 guns work fine without bump stocks.  99.99999% of people don't use them.  Guns don't work very well without ammunition.  This isn't a good argument to make.
2082 2018-02-22 17:58:28 I always wonder why we have prison, yes some people are bad, like people who take one life, but why do we put people in prison for everthing else. Who benefit from it. Why do we have prison stocks? Who are buying these stocks? Why do poor people end up in jail

2085 2018-02-22 17:57:44 People have to keep up with the times. With the criminals! An ordinary citizen would not have a chance against a bunch of criminals with bump stocks! You can't take the guns away from all the people.
2086 2018-02-22 17:57:42 Gotta do some research on how to buy dang stocks now, haha!
2087 2018-02-22 17:57:38 @rushlimbaugh Nobody new The Vegas shooter was waco Rush. They still don’t know why he did it. Just blew a gasket with his AR-15s and bump stocks   Multiple.   Can’t spot all the crazies ahead of time.
2088 2018-02-22 17:57:37 2) Of course semi-auto rifles whether with a wood stock like the mini-14 or with scary looking black plastic stocks like the Armalight-15 are and have been perfectly legal forever.

For you to attempt to muddy the argument, saying that it is simply a "vocabulary" issue is ...
2089 2018-02-22 17:57:25 Trump already is pushing a bill banning bump stocks, increasing mental heaslth checks on background checks, and raising the age to 21. That's comprosming. Which is fair and doesn't fringe upon the second amendment
2090 2018-02-22 17:57:18 And.....getting rid of bump stocks should have happened the week that slaughter happened in Las Vegas! You are slow!
2091 2018-02-22 17:56:59 besides his ignorance on bump stocks?
2092 2018-02-22 17:56:54 So much for a good inter island ferry, when we gave them the contract did the great and the good know we only had 7 favarable crossing, if they did they need to be put in stocks and if they didn't they still need to be put in stocks for giving a contract without knowing facts
2093 2018-02-22 17:56:45 Who is buying these stocks? Who is soulless enough to want to profit off of murdered children?!
2094 2018-02-22 17:56:37 Dear Mr President;
While I applaud your success in general as our commander in chief,  I must say that outlawing bump stocks is no different than outlawing any other accessory or weapon.
Please repeal existing restrictions on full auto firearms. It's not about duck hunting.
2095 2018-02-22 17:56:36 President Trumps proposed ideas to protect our kids at school:

-Raising minimum age to buy long guns from 18 to 21

-Better background checks

-Mental institutions

-Banning bump stocks
#MentalHealth #GunReform #ParklandFlorida #LetsMakeAChange
2096 2018-02-22 17:56:26 See your point but let's not be too quick to forget  the years of dumping thousands of tons of perfectly good fish back into the sea, dead because of the common fisheries policy and it's unfathomable attempt to "protect" fish stocks
2097 2018-02-22 17:56:25 Trump to ban bump stocks. I told you it didn't matter who got elected. They do what they want.
2098 2018-02-22 17:56:24 The answer isn’t do nothing. The answer is to ban sales of AR-15 and bump stocks etc and move from there.
2099 2018-02-22 17:56:03 Really, then why did your lord and Savior Obama approve bump stocks for sale.... I guess he was a dumb ass after all.
2100 2018-02-22 17:56:03 @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons, AR15, AK47, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors, ban #NRA. Regulate/license existing guns. Mandatory mental screening, background checks, #gunsafety training before gun sale. Make America Safe Again. #MASA
2101 2018-02-22 17:56:01 I believe Trump will make sure Congress follows through on banning bump stocks.  There will be increased background checks.  In New Jersey, and other states, there's a in person interview conducted. I think that should be mandatory.
2102 2018-02-22 17:55:54 You can speak as violently and with as much vulgarity as you like, but it doesn't make you right. Dangerous weapons, and equipment like bump stocks, have no business in the hands of non-military personnel. We're not talking about hunting rifles.
2103 2018-02-22 17:55:53 The Florida legislature could have simply made military grade weapons, bump stocks, illegal for civilians but instead they intentionally put language in there that would cause guns like a colt 6 so that nothing would pass. Monsters of the NRA.
2104 2018-02-22 17:55:52 Words matter: “comprehensive” is different than “universal”. And what about universal bans for domestic abusers & stalkers as several states are pushing? Also, ending the sale of bump stocks is very different than banning them. Wonder if these are intentional?
2105 2018-02-22 17:55:50 Don’t miss the fact this too is psychological projection. Ask her how many bump stocks were sold after the Las Vegas shooting.  As they always do after an attack, gun related slaes skyrocketed. 

She knows she’s lying.
2106 2018-02-22 17:55:42 In other news, maybe @potus just picked a fight w/ the @NRA over bump stocks & raising the minimum age for rifle purchases? We'll see...
2107 2018-02-22 17:55:28 I wish if anyone noticed most of the calls of buying on dip and managed to target buying today
I see most stocks with ideal situation, hitting buying target and then bounced back
so far i saw #POWER and #MLCF
Amazing gain
2108 2018-02-22 17:55:20 The really horrifying thing is that the NRA *does* love mass shootings, because they always lead to a huge uptick in gun sales, price of gun stocks and their membership.
2109 2018-02-22 17:55:05 America, please don’t let these red herrings about bump stocks and arming teachers derail your fight for gun control. The NRA bastards and your dickhead president will change NOTHING unless you force them to #GunLawsNOW
2110 2018-02-22 17:55:04 Still aggravated with you for not saying bump stocks don't make firearms full auto (and disagree on the God thing), but kudos for being classy with this guy.
2111 2018-02-22 17:54:59 Bump stocks can be milled at home.

Are we then going to make it illegal for pple to buy the components that they are comprised of?
2112 2018-02-22 17:54:57 To protect ourselves from a tyrannical government. That's not really feasible with bump stocks
2113 2018-02-22 17:54:47 Touche'! Raising the age would do little, as the average age of mass murderers in US is 35. Bump stocks wouldn't be needed if there wasn't the weapon to use them on. Expanded background checks is a must. Here I go talking common sense again...#BanAssaultWeapons
2114 2018-02-22 17:54:36 You DON'T need a Constitutional Ammendment to ban bump stocks..
2115 2018-02-22 17:54:35 @Aye_itslaylay nice!
2116 2018-02-22 17:54:30 4. A ban on bump stocks and the (to my mind as a husband and son of teachers) suggestion that teachers be armed aren’t even close to an answer.
2117 2018-02-22 17:54:02 Anna it is one thing to be a responsible gun owner, but no private law abiding citizen needs an AR-15, AK-47 and Bump stocks. There is NO sound reasons for people outside of the military to have these items!!
2118 2018-02-22 17:54:00 If we can’t beat them, join them. I say we all go out and purchase AR-15s then. Bump stocks too. Purchase one for your entire family.
2119 2018-02-22 17:53:57 @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons, AR15, AK47, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors, ban #NRA. Regulate/license existing guns. Mandatory mental screening, background checks, #gunsafety training before gun sale. Make America Safe Again. #MASA
2120 2018-02-22 17:53:56 Being legal is not the same as being a right. You have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Congress, or states, have the right to ban bump stocks any time they please.
See Scalia opinion in Heller.
#neveragain
#GunReformNow
2121 2018-02-22 17:53:53 Really? I’ve been exposed to my share of trolls. Right from the yahoo stocks message boards to Twitter
2122 2018-02-22 17:53:52 The Constitution was written at a time when people needed guns to protect their property from predators and to hunt for food. Though people still hunt and have a need for personal protection, where do bump stocks come in as necessity? They don't. All assault weapons should go.
2123 2018-02-22 17:53:47 Fingers don't move that fast. And guess what - Massachusetts has already passed legislation banning bump stocks, and other states are following. So states are going to do it on their own, federal law or not.
2124 2018-02-22 17:53:45 $uav down to .165 might be a good time to buy before financials end of month
2125 2018-02-22 17:53:39 The presidents action to ban bump stocks, increase the legal age to purchase a rifle to 21, restore the right of self protection to responsible adults in schools and working with Congress to increase school security will work so much better than all those gun free Zone signs
2126 2018-02-22 17:53:36 6/ bump stocks, high capacity magazines, armor piercing ammunition, etc., universal background checks, are all good measures and should be enacted. Written and field testing before licensing should be added to ensure people know how to safely use weapons they are purchasing.
2127 2018-02-22 17:53:32 You do realize that bump stocks were originally designed for disabled people to be able to use a rifle.
2128 2018-02-22 17:53:19 It’s a step in the right direction. With proper training, it can be a definite deterrent. Age congruence bt long guns and hand guns, banning of bump stocks all worthwhile changes Pres Trump, ironically, will be the first President to foster change. Let that sink in
2129 2018-02-22 17:53:05 Really Mr. President, bump stocks? You can't stop evil!
2130 2018-02-22 17:53:03 an idea on how lame today is is to look at STLD and NUE. Two recent high flying steel stocks up AT 1.5% +/- today w/ both stocks avg 1000 shares a minutes (17 per second). No real strength, just a few shares buying w/o much selling.

2133 2018-02-22 17:52:39 President @POTUS wants to get rid of bump stocks and raise the age to buy an automatic rifle to 21, also wants to open/reopen mental health institutions

2137 2018-02-22 17:52:07 Trump; we want to do strong background checks, get age up to 21, get rid of bump stocks.. and mental health.... (claims mental health institutions are largely closed)

love ya Man, !!!!!!!!!!!!!MAGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2139 2018-02-22 17:52:04 people don't have fully auto weapons. they make bump stocks to make semi autos mimic the behavior of fully auto.

full auto is more tightly regulated.
2140 2018-02-22 17:51:48 Are computers designed specifically for cyber bullying?  Because bump stocks and AR15 are designed to kill people
2141 2018-02-22 17:51:47 When rates are popping, JP Morgan and these other Dow stocks win...
2142 2018-02-22 17:51:45 Well said!! What does it look cool?!?  No constructive purpose...yank that shit. I wish I shorted bump stocks stocks
2143 2018-02-22 17:51:36 The NRA has always protected the second amendment.  People have the right to bear arms.  There is a cost to having that freedom.  Doesnt mean gun owners dont care.  Trump has just done a great service by banning bump stocks that make guns full auto.

They supported the NFA, FFA, and GCA and are currently supporting regulation on bump stocks and similar devices behind the backs of members with the ATF.
2147 2018-02-22 17:50:51 #hoesoutherebuiltlike banned bump stocks
2148 2018-02-22 17:50:46 How do you define assault rifle? Anything can be defined as an assault weapon. Are you saying ban semi-automatic rifles? If so, then I’m on board with that to an extent. Definitely ban bump stocks and anything that holds more that 15 bullets
2149 2018-02-22 17:50:45 I’m for it, but then if you want all assault weapons gone, that means every single weapon in the United State. Nobody has a gun. IROTFLMAO. Then say it correctly, ban high capacity clips, bump stocks and high velocity ammo. Not guns, 2nd Amendment says NO.
2150 2018-02-22 17:50:36 @TheStalwart [tech] stocks
2151 2018-02-22 17:50:25 @realDonaldTrump remember the Brady bill?? if assault rifles "only" were banned bump stocks and there accessories would only be door stop! "root cause analysis"
2152 2018-02-22 17:50:21 You can use anything to become a bump stock. I can use a stick to make my revolver automatic. Bump stocks were used in one disgusting massacre yet supposedly we know NOTHING about it.
2153 2018-02-22 17:50:21 Mental health- Yes. However, how can you expect someone to go to war for this country at the age of 18, yet not allow them to buy a gun until they are 21?? Terrible! Also, the sell of bump stocks and other attachments should also be included in the extensive background check!
2154 2018-02-22 17:50:19 rates need to top out or stocks will
2155 2018-02-22 17:50:18 #never The AR 15 is not a gun it is a WEAPON OF WAR.  Magazines, bump stocks and any other devices that turn guns into assault weapons need to removed from circulation. The 2nd amendment "the right to bear arms" does not include WEAPONS OF WAR.
2156 2018-02-22 17:50:13 Y’all being petty. Who cares about numb stocks? Stop treating kids like babies, start teaching morality, and hey humility before God wouldn’t be a bad thing to implement

2159 2018-02-22 17:49:48 Bump stocks are not mentioned anywhere in the US constitution
2160 2018-02-22 17:49:40 Bump stocks killed 50 people in Vegas. Reagan is the one who banned full auto rifles, and in sure he wasn't a big fan of loopholes.

2163 2018-02-22 17:49:24 He said, "Stocks fluctuate." She said, "What the HELL did you just say to me?" He said, "I said 'stocks fluctuate'." She said, "Oh! Never mind."
2164 2018-02-22 17:49:21 If 2017 was a party. 2018 is going to be the hangover morning. 

Choose your stocks prudently. You will get enough time to research and buy. 

No hurry, nothing is running away.
2165 2018-02-22 17:49:12 UST10 yield went up 100 bps in Q2 & Q3 2013 and data center stocks went down 20-30%; we've just had a smaller move in rates over a similar time frame yet stocks have pulled back just as much
2166 2018-02-22 17:49:06 Guessing you make bump stocks. Tough cookies.
2167 2018-02-22 17:49:04 I agree with you bump stocks need to be removed from the market we don't need to increase our rate of fire of these weapons I own an AR I can shoot plenty fast without a bump stock not needed
2168 2018-02-22 17:48:58 @realDonaldTrump If you wanted to fix this problem. It would of been done yesterday! Assholes bump stocks don't kill people. Guns kill people! Fucktard
2169 2018-02-22 17:48:31 get rid of all assault, automatic, semi automatic weapons-ban them-no civilian needs them. ban bump stocks and high capacity ammunition magazines. that’s what you can do
@HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @PRyan @realDonaldTrump
#BanAR15s
#NoWeaponsOfWar
2170 2018-02-22 17:48:22 We should ban sales to anyone under 21. Ban bump stocks.  Ban sales of assault weapons. Kill loopholes for purchase at gun shows. Allow psychiatrists to input information with psychosis. Psychotic people shouldn't have  a gun. Guns should be locked around kids!
2171 2018-02-22 17:48:20 You Now controlled by dEMONICRATS? Are you Now going to bow to LEFTIST IDEOLOGY that "HATES" OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS? Please show me WHERE it says ANY Prez can Unilaterally STEAL OUR RIGHTS? PROBLEM isn't BUMP-STOCKS-The PROBLEM "IS" LEFTISM-& "BIG PHARMA'S PSYCHO DRUGS!" STOP!
2172 2018-02-22 17:47:55 I'll bet you could get in any door w a crowbar. That's just speculation. 

 I recently heard someone say you couldn't conceal a rifle under your coat. They have never heard of folding stocks apparently.

 Many self-proclaimed experts on everything on Twitter.
2173 2018-02-22 17:47:52 Ban assault weapons, ban number stocks, serious federal background checks, streamline reporting to one agency
2174 2018-02-22 17:47:46 Actually bump stocks isn’t your right! Please reread the 2nd Amendment. How does “arms” translate bump stock? Also, it’s the President’s Constitutional responsibility to protect ALL US citizens and keep them safe regardless of 2nd Amendment. Common Sense has to apply to safety
2175 2018-02-22 17:47:34 I'm interested in possibly arming some specially trained teachers.  Maybe.  Also stricter backgrlund checks and no bump stocks.
2176 2018-02-22 17:47:31 I don’t think I read anyone saying guns should be illegal. However, I see no reason for bump stocks. I hear they are highly inaccurate wat 4
2177 2018-02-22 17:47:28 That’s a flat out lie to make NRA supporters rise up. Keep your guns and ammo, but lose the military weapons, with the large mags, bump stocks, and any accessories that can modify legal weapons into arms of mass destruction. You have a standing army as well as the national guard.
2178 2018-02-22 17:47:17 We need the band completely bump stocks we don't need them we shouldn't need to increase our rate of fire on these weapons there quick enough as it is "ban the bump" keep making America great again sir thank you
2179 2018-02-22 17:47:04 If wealth linked to stocks is so concentrated, why object to LTCG?
2180 2018-02-22 17:46:44 Who? It’s not a serious conversation anyone is having, yet.  The intransigence of the gun lobby for common sense would seem to be pushing people to that position which would be ridiculous.  Are bumps stocks really necessary.  There’s no slippery slope here.
2181 2018-02-22 17:46:40 Now that stocks have rallied so much the 10yr can start moving back towards 3%
2182 2018-02-22 17:46:36 I write stocks and various deals
It's a blog.
Looking at Americans
2183 2018-02-22 17:46:21 bump fire stocks prices after Trump announced the ban 
2184 2018-02-22 17:46:14 Well, Trump is offering removal of bump stocks, raising age for firearms possession to 21, and strengthening the background-check process. This would effectively make it harder to get than getting abortion, buying tobacco/alcohol, buying/renting car, and in some ways buying house
2185 2018-02-22 17:46:09 I’m ready to part with my AR-15’s, they are super nice with bump stocks, silencers, barrel shrouds, and bayonet mounted grenade launchers. Will trade each one for pairs of @phish summer tour floor tickets.
2186 2018-02-22 17:46:04 Not the answer start Ak47 bump stocks ect. !! Security metal detectors at schools!!!!
2187 2018-02-22 17:45:53 Seems like they’re going to ban bump stocks which make semi automatic to virtually automatic weapons. Used in Vegas but still not enough
2188 2018-02-22 17:45:44 market which keeps rewarding money-losing tech stocks while punishing undervalued cash cows
2189 2018-02-22 17:45:29 Trump got $33Million-plus  from NRA and GOP Congress at least $53 Million. Putin paid NRA Billions to destroy America. Buy their stocks up People and gain control of their Boardroom. They all value $$$$ more than American lives. They are far worse together than ISIS.
2190 2018-02-22 17:45:25 I’m not fucking with bitcoin now. It declined badly. Yeah it’s the perfect time to catch the rebound but I’m not. Rather deal with penny stocks even tho those just as bad too.
2191 2018-02-22 17:45:19 Bump stocks are not guns, therefore do not infringe your 2nd amendment right. Accessories are not protected.
2192 2018-02-22 17:45:11 I checked the constitution...nothing about bump stocks. You can't just pull rights out of thin air.
2193 2018-02-22 17:44:47 the term  semiautomatic a good 80% of all weapons are semi automatic it just means no other action is required other than pulling the trigger is required to fire an additional round these bump stocks were just ingenious invention to replicate fully automatic weapon. With this
2194 2018-02-22 17:44:41 She has a valid argument that deserves to be heard.  Your's, an opinion.  I bet there are hundreds of bump stocks that never are used to kill people but one was and you hang your hat on it,  WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS, BUT ITS OKAY WITH YOU THAT COPS HAVE GUNS.
2195 2018-02-22 17:44:39 try now!
2196 2018-02-22 17:44:31 There was nothing said about fingers. Bump stocks are unnecessary like fully automatic weapons for civilians. There is no purpose for a bump stock.
2197 2018-02-22 17:44:30 Nothing much will change. Maybe bump stocks outlawed? That’s good, not enough, take a guess what’s in our future...
2198 2018-02-22 17:44:27 Banning bump stocks does nothing. I have never owned a bump stock and yet I still bumpfire. Hell, you can bumpfire without a regular stock.
2199 2018-02-22 17:44:22 Are you kidding me? Mass shootings have become a common occurrence and you are praising the NRA. Don't take anymore donations, ban assault rifles and bump stocks, implement sanctions against Russia, and resign. That would MAGA. #TreasonousBastard
2200 2018-02-22 17:44:09 Nope. A “bolt action rifle” needs to rechamber a round after each fire.  Hunting and assault rifles both can be magazine fed. Almost all handguns are magazine fed as well. You can’t “spray” a crowd, they are not fully automatic. Before you say it, yes bump stocks should be banned
2201 2018-02-22 17:43:34 Rip bump stocks
2202 2018-02-22 17:43:31 There are no abortion rights in the Bill of Rights/ Constitution. I am not so sure I support Bump stocks, BUT DO REMEMBER - ONCE YOU TAKE A RIGHT AWAY - pretty rare you'll ever get it back......AND that goes for ANY right.
2203 2018-02-22 17:43:12 BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS! Reduce cartridge size. Ban bump stocks and similar mods.  Expand background checks. Raise the age of gun ownership to 25, when the decision making centers of the brain are fully formed in a neurotypical individual.
2204 2018-02-22 17:43:03 @realDonaldTrump I’m completely ok with the background checks and the bump stocks, but raising the age for rifles to 21 is ridiculous! More people are killed with handguns than rifles. Not only will this not do anything but you will lose alot of support.
2205 2018-02-22 17:42:55 His followers are already crying about bump stocks
2206 2018-02-22 17:42:50 Psst, I have a secret: TradeJester is now available on iOS and Android. Oh, and you can win free #stocks. Download it today. #BeTheFirst #StealthLaunch
2207 2018-02-22 17:42:35 TSX rises with resource stocks
2208 2018-02-22 17:42:33 I see some stocks to own, in the most unlikely of places. Stock screener would only alert to someone that's already moving, and then you gotta chase it.
2209 2018-02-22 17:42:31 And of course, there are bump stocks that make it so the gun will fire without pulling the trigger for each bullet. The Las Vegas shooter used one of those.
2210 2018-02-22 17:42:01 Bump stocks are nothing, you can use a regular everyday rubber band to do the same thing. And raising the age to 21. So are you saying that they can’t vote or go into the military until their 21 then ? Don’t be bullied by the left and let the ones who believed in you Mr.President
2211 2018-02-22 17:41:28 And the Lord rejoiced as bump stocks and AR-15’s rained down like manna from Heaven! 
2212 2018-02-22 17:41:21 I agree. Ban the assault weapons, bump stocks, etc.!

Until the NRA paid shills stop taking blood money, I want protection in schools for my loved ones! I haven't seen any data of a school shooter blasting their way through a MD. It's better than NOTHING!
2213 2018-02-22 17:41:21 Trump asks;"Why do we need Bump Stocks?" I ask;Why do REPUBS&Dems violate 10th Amend almost every single day & U sign the Bill?
2214 2018-02-22 17:41:07 I can see that happening but can't the president do something? Block bump stocks or change the age at which you can legally purchase weapons? I would think they could do something.
2215 2018-02-22 17:40:48 i donated 20p therefore i own a share of the stocks, so tell me ur business boyo or so help me
2216 2018-02-22 17:40:44 Oh you don’t need to know what he buys and sells. Just glance what he likes stocks and you look on your indicators which is best thing. I follow him but just see names of stocks he likes then I look up my chart if it can run nice or not.
2217 2018-02-22 17:40:40 You can still have all the guns that you want. Just not bump stocks. Using your logic we should also be allowed to possess fully automatic weapons
2218 2018-02-22 17:40:39 certain modifications should be banned, like bump stocks. but the majority of gun owners aren't violent. we need to keep guns out of the hands of those that are threats, which is why we should implement UBC's and psychological evaluation, instead of banning them as a whole
2219 2018-02-22 17:40:38 He also said he is going for stricter background checks, and doing more for mental health. Also for removing the bump stocks but you only focus on the one thig you disagree with
2220 2018-02-22 17:40:26 I do care. I also care about white men born in the US using assault rifles and bump stocks to kill innocent people and children.
2221 2018-02-22 17:40:15 These are the easy days to understand:  i-rates⇩ → stocks, commodities, gold all⇧ & $⇩ (the opposite is easy too), it's when i-rates & stocks (et al. sans $) move the same way that mental hell breaks out in my head. The Fed is the cause of mental hell - it distorts everything
2222 2018-02-22 17:40:05 Wall Street rises sharply as rate hike fears ease: (Reuters) - Gains in technology and industrial shares helped U.S. stocks rebound from a two-day fall on Thursday as investors shrugged off the prospects of more interest rate hikes this year.
2223 2018-02-22 17:39:50 At the cyclic rate you’d need to fire - you’d burn the barrel before you’d be effective- bump stocks aren’t what you think they are- why are you not demanding the @FBI provide the results of the #VegasShooting ??
2224 2018-02-22 17:39:45 True but these things might be doable by executive order or changes to exsisting laws. The ATF can ban bump stocks tomorrow for instance.
2225 2018-02-22 17:39:39 Talaga lang, sinabi mo pa. Lagi yan ang problema, tignan mo nung 4th fm parang sobrang unti lang yung stocks ng merch. Kaya sana naman please damihan niya yung stocks. Parang awa niya na. Di naman siya magiging poor kung dadamihan niya. #GOT7 #갓세븐 #GOT7WorldTour2018 #EyesOnYou
2226 2018-02-22 17:39:31 I can certainly agree on that. But we did have something called an assault weapons ban and we had less shootings. I’d don’t want to disarm all folks. And I’m about as liberal as you get. But I think bump stocks need to go and let’s talk about nixing high capacity magazines.
2227 2018-02-22 17:39:26 one of my rules is to not trade stocks that AF tweets. lol.
2228 2018-02-22 17:39:15 Trump wants to eliminate bump stocks, make the age 21 to purchase any gun, but he’s still a pos? Whatever a lot more than Obama ever did in his 162 mass shootings over his eight years
2229 2018-02-22 17:39:14 And God said behold, 25% off bump stocks at Bob's Gunatorium, and the people partook
2230 2018-02-22 17:39:10 I strongly suggest you and @SpeakerRyan get to work banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines immediately, as the next attack is going to raise support for banning ALL guns to above 80%.  I am a Republican & a gun owner, and I want an #AssaultWeaponsBanNow.
2231 2018-02-22 17:39:07 To what end? Gun sales don't profit the NRA or Dana Loesch unless they own a significant amount of gun manufacturer stocks in which case it would be an SEC issue.
2232 2018-02-22 17:39:00 Wheres a $1 plus at now. Otc turd stocks. Im holding a 1500 loss on fusz now , probably will close at .55-.57 then hope for a good green candle tommorow although the support line was busted today being it went to .48
2233 2018-02-22 17:39:00 "And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great big guns with bump stocks, which shall be available to all people so they can mowest down the children as they learneth the math"

Hablaboobla! Rejuice!
2234 2018-02-22 17:38:51 bitcoins are declining, bonds are declining, time for stocks to go down now...it almost seems like if these gentlemen (read crooks) from the central bank and the CEO's of the big banks (again, read crooks) are propping up the stocks also??
2235 2018-02-22 17:38:51 Bitcoin will smash gold . So will our Canadian Marijuana stocks come July 1st . Looking at 10,000% gains in a few months in the pot stock sector
2236 2018-02-22 17:38:48 I am not pro, or against bump stocks, by the way. You just st need to make better arguments.
2237 2018-02-22 17:38:37 @RaymondJames says we could even get FIVE rate hikes this year and stocks would still thrive - great, let's get started on that.  50 bps in March would be a good start. #Fed
2238 2018-02-22 17:38:25 You are an idiot.
I guess teachers are immune from stress & mental problems?
The shooters will only aim their AR15 at a teacher first.
"being offensive" would be banning automatic rifles & bump stocks
But you've made it obvious you are trying to con us & support the NRA
2239 2018-02-22 17:38:23 I never said we weren’t well equipped but why should bump stocks be banned?
2240 2018-02-22 17:38:05 Reading through some uneducated responses this morning..... apparently the uneducated population thinks that "bump stocks" turn any weapon into an automatic assault rifle..... oy vey.  Common sense people, that's all it takes to make it in the gun world..
2241 2018-02-22 17:37:57 We’re also NRA-ing this 

Of course it’s not just a one dimensional solution.  I’m ALL for families and getting back to the basics of a good father in charge/values

There is no reason why people need ARs, bump stocks and the like

No reason to want ZERO done w guns 

Illogical
2242 2018-02-22 17:37:34 What guidelines behind intrusion and extrusion of stocks from nifty50? Midcap indices?
2243 2018-02-22 17:37:25 Im curious as to when you first heard of bump stocks.  Not worried who is for or against, just when they were first aware of them.
2244 2018-02-22 17:37:03 Banning bump stocks is NOT enough:  reauthorize the ban on assault weapons-- and ban not only bump stocks but high-capacity magazines. LET'S GET THIS DONE!
2245 2018-02-22 17:36:58 .@AWRHawkins Hey, you forgot something: "In fact, the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack was the only high profile shooting on record in which bump stocks were used. [The attack was also the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the U.S.]" 

There, much better!
2246 2018-02-22 17:36:46 How much money do the #GunManufacturers stand to make by providing guns and ammo to ALL THOSE TEACHERS? STAGGERING!

2247 2018-02-22 17:36:40 #PARKLAND Bump stocks turn a 1 trigger pull gun into a pull the trigger once and the gun fires all the ammo at a high rate of speed Why Bump Stocks are legal ? Once the gun is engaged it fires until empty ...Automatic is triggers pull NOT DISPUTING just know what you talking
2248 2018-02-22 17:36:36 But there's alot of stocks to do :((
2249 2018-02-22 17:36:32 You're def, he's going to ban bump stocks, raise the legal age for rifle puchases from 18 to 21, allow adult the right to self protect themselves and their students and take steps to increase security at schools.

I know that's going to work better than putting up gun free signs
2250 2018-02-22 17:36:32 trump will ban bump stocks with tacit NRA approval so that he can say he has listened to the people. It's theatre.
2251 2018-02-22 17:36:26 Yeah back in the 1770s they had bump stocks. Widely unkown to historians. The Constitution clearly states "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms (including bump stocks), shall not be infringed."
2252 2018-02-22 17:36:25 "Elites don't care about school safety" says a man that is defending guns, does not want to ban assault rifles or bump stocks and has no problems with kids or people with mental health issues having them.
2253 2018-02-22 17:36:14 What needs to happen: 1. Greatly enhanced background checks for gun buyers.  2. Ban high-capacity mags, assault weapons, bump stocks. 3. Stiff penalties for noncompliance. 4. Buyback programs for guns.  5. Allow handguns for self-defense, rifles for hunting.  IT WORKS ELSEWHERE!
2254 2018-02-22 17:36:13 I’d say the Indices & futures are the underlying & stocks the derivatives. Everything is priced off ETF flows these days.
2255 2018-02-22 17:36:07 Removing the ban on bump stocks is what Obama should be remembered for. Only big gun change he made. Can anyone say, “Las Vegas”? Once it came out that it was his ATF that brought gun stocks back, the story of such a horrific shooting pretty much died.

2261 2018-02-22 17:34:57 Brian not bought, but influenced. There is a difference.The NRA represents a great and diverse ppls.I dont see the need for automatic weapons being available to the public but most r modified semis like bump stocks. My ? is y arent we addressing mh, which I see as the real issue
2262 2018-02-22 17:34:51 Exactly. His proposals are NRA friendly. The bump stocks, an element of negotiation they created long time ago. DISGUSTING.
2263 2018-02-22 17:34:41 Au contraire. There are no GOOD reasons to ban bump stocks. Would you ban cars b/c some sicko uses it as a weapon to kill? No? Then why ban ANYTHING even related to firearms? Makes NO sense. It's the PERSON, not the tool, who is responsible!
2264 2018-02-22 17:34:29 he's projecting bro, he still buys stocks l0000000l brotherman is stuck in the past
2265 2018-02-22 17:34:24 If we ban bump stocks and weapons of war but keep hunting rifles shotguns and handguns that is not taking away “our” guns. You still have guns and 2nd amendment is not violated.
2266 2018-02-22 17:34:01 First of all, any gun control law is an infringement(besides felons/mentally ill not being allowed to own guns, I stand behind that ONE). Second, bump stocks are practically useless, anyway.
2267 2018-02-22 17:33:56 With AR15s and bump stocks. ?
2268 2018-02-22 17:33:48 I’m surprised @Amazon and other retail online businesses didn’t help curb this- I will be slowing down my online shopping and shopping in Brick & Mortar. @Jet @Walmart @Twitter @instagram @Snapchat #NetNeutrality this will eventually hurt ur bottom line/stocks & Holidays.
2269 2018-02-22 17:33:23 US stocks making quite a move back up here.. Confidence is back..
2270 2018-02-22 17:33:20 I support banning bump stocks for untrusted citizens, bullup rifles would still give them a viable option for self-defense even with less recoil. We should however give full access to all guns and customizations for experienced gun owners who have a clean criminal record.
2271 2018-02-22 17:33:20 Maybe just pray to Jesus and you’ll get to keep your bump stocks!

2275 2018-02-22 17:32:50 glad to read President Trump didn't throw the AR 15 owners under the bus to far . bump fire stocks to me always seemed like a waste of ammo . lots of practice = a well placed shot that = accuracy , isn't this what most safe shooters like anyway ?
2276 2018-02-22 17:32:47 Removing  bump stocks will not do anything! Funny that one thing that was made to be a disability accommodation, is the thing he wants to focus on LOL

2278 2018-02-22 17:32:35 #stocks#StockMarketCrash  Millennials should avoid hedge funds  like the Black Death. With their shills and their allurements designed to seduce you to gamble in their casinos. Stick to periodic investments in your tax-deferred ETF or index fund account.
2279 2018-02-22 17:32:31 What's taking away Bump stocks going to do. It's a heart problem not a gun problem. Discipline children, be parents first not friends. Quit letting them spend hours each day killing in video games. Be responsible for your childrens behavior. Teach them right and wrong.
2280 2018-02-22 17:32:30 Las Vegas! 58 killed, 489 wounded. One man did that with bump stocks.
2281 2018-02-22 17:32:21 They all live to shoot n'kill for another day. They leave the show w/their assault-style weapons & bump stocks & then head to our schools, shopping malls, concerts, movie theaters, workplaces & hospitals & KILL innocent children. You can't do that with a rifle or a musket!!

2283 2018-02-22 17:32:17 Nowadays, large magazines, bump stocks, more guns on the street make it easier. If they could only fire one shot at a time, wouldn't be so inviting to those considering an attack.

2285 2018-02-22 17:32:02 everyone can talk about rates all they want, its all an excuse to sell this inflated bubble.  if not rates it could be something else.

for the nearterm, i think we going lower again.... pick safe stocks
2286 2018-02-22 17:31:59 Bump stocks are gimmicks IMO--but the fact the BATF approved them and the democrats DON"T (Experts VS.Politicians) tells me they should remain as options for law abiding people--probably not Chicago drug gangs, tho--
2287 2018-02-22 17:31:52 FYI, Bump stocks were not a thing in 1776....
2288 2018-02-22 17:31:52 Bump stocks don't make semiautomatics into automatics. No one would ever go into the battlefield with one. They are very inaccurate by comparison. About the only thing the do is give you a sense of what an automatic feels like.
2289 2018-02-22 17:31:45 This is the biggest bubble in history, many magnitudes larger than 2008. The reason media doesn't talk about it is that it requires understanding how financial system is structured. Reality is we have a bubble in sovereign bonds which has induced secondary bubbles in stocks

2291 2018-02-22 17:31:27 The NRA is the tax free advertising and lobbying organisation for gun manufacturers who don't want their stocks to crash because of safer regulations.
2292 2018-02-22 17:31:20 This coming from someone that did nothing about it while in office?? He legalized bump stocks...
2293 2018-02-22 17:31:19 I've seen it floated around that he's going to ban bump stocks. If that's true, I'll give him a high five for it. But if this is a "mental health issue," he needs to explain why he repealed Obama's restrictions that dealt w/ mental health... Need consistency.

2295 2018-02-22 17:31:06 Wayne why do people on Do Not Fly list, mental disability, & children need AR-15s w bump stocks, high capacity mags & unlimited ammo? Why do we need schools to be like jails? Im pro 2A but common sense isn’t a violation.
2296 2018-02-22 17:31:04 Owning a bump stock when automatic weapons are against the law and bump stocks are just a way to circumvent this law IS AN ISSUE.  Not having mental health issues as a reason for not owning a gun IS AN ISSUE.  Stop with the 2nd Amendment as a reason for sane gun CONTROL laws
2297 2018-02-22 17:31:02 While you're at it, please discuss:
1. Your executive action rolling back restrictions on mentally ill people to purchase guns
2. Raising age limit to purchase guns
3. Actually IMPLEMENT law to ban bump stocks; no "proposal"
4. Restrict purchase of Assault weapons
DO SOMETHING!
2298 2018-02-22 17:30:59 You're nuts, let's have a gun battle in school. Get rid of assault guns and bump stocks at the very least.
2299 2018-02-22 17:30:56 You'll have to forgive me, Twitter and it's character limit forces me to cut some stuff out. But the penalties and the process don't necessarily force compliance. They lead to legal alternatives like binary triggers and bump stocks.
2300 2018-02-22 17:30:22 That sense of humour is only one of the reasons why u r my favourite @bnn celebrity. The other reason is your thorough in depth knowledge of the stocks you reccomend.
2301 2018-02-22 17:30:19 Bump stocks are not mentioned in the 2nd amendment! We have the right to own a gun, but we also have a right for safe public places!
2302 2018-02-22 17:30:18 To be fair, at least Trump is trying to ban certain stocks for assault rifles, so that’s good.  However he did initially make it easier for mentally unstable people to get guns so..you know...

2305 2018-02-22 17:29:41 But they will. Like banning butt-stocks. Regulating magazine size for rifles/pistols. limiting ammo quantity you can purchase. Taxing ammo on a yearly basis.
If people are going to say "ban assault weapons", what they mean when they say it.
That's what I'm asking.
2306 2018-02-22 17:29:39 When I “retired” at age 63 from the profession of nuclear waste management, I devoted my mathematical skills to assessing the intrinsic value of stocks and portfolio mgnt. I haven’t looked back as I now have this new and fascinating job.
2307 2018-02-22 17:29:17 They last only three minutes because they can shoot hundreds of rounds in that time killing and maiming dozens. It's all the time they need. Get rid of assault type weapons with large clips and bump stocks. Only good for killing people, nothing else.

2311 2018-02-22 17:28:52 1) You can’t arbitrarily ban bump stocks. 2) Will voting & Selective Service registration ages be raised to 21?
2312 2018-02-22 17:28:51 Bump stocks are literally useless for anything other than spraying bullets into crowds.  Happy to give them up if it means I can get pistol grips back in CA.
2313 2018-02-22 17:28:47 Fuck that bullshit NRA rhetoric. 
Im a gun owner, im not saying take away all the guns. I'm saying, there's no need for ANY ole person, w/o a background check to be able to buy a gun. Let alone an automatic gun or an accessory like bump stocks. That's too accessible.
2314 2018-02-22 17:28:39 1. How will raising the age prevent Parkland-like incidents?
2. Bump stocks are not required to "bump fire" AR-type arms. What is the point, then, of a bump stock ban?
3. If "comprehensive" means "universal", it's the wrong answer.
2315 2018-02-22 17:28:31 #BanAssaultWeapons #neveragain Answer is simple. Ban assault weapon sales, background checks, no cash & carry, no bump stocks.
2316 2018-02-22 17:28:29 Only Trump can get rational and effective gun control passed.  Legal age 21, mental health checks, and ban bump stocks.
2317 2018-02-22 17:28:18 oooooh

2322 2018-02-22 17:27:49 If you ban bump stocks, then you will have to ban rubber bands, belt loops and a person's finger from the trigger all the mention speed up the rate of fire. YouTube it and you will see what I am talking about.
2323 2018-02-22 17:27:45 I can’t even believe that mflynnJR is actually posting videos and links to videos about how to make your own bump stocks at home.
2324 2018-02-22 17:27:40 “We’ve got your backs.” The ATF reaffirmed the legalization of the bumpfire stocks used during the LV massacre during your tenure. Violence reached a pinnacle while you were POTUS. Support them. But don’t lie to them.
2325 2018-02-22 17:27:34 Ah yes stocks and dividends are more important than killing of children. Fox news viewers are bots
2326 2018-02-22 17:27:14 I hope you are prepared to lose the 2020 election if you let a SINGLE ridiculous new law be passed that infringes on our rights. We need MORE GUNS, we need armed teachers. Bump stocks are NOT THE PROBLEM. That will lead to the repeal of the second ammendment.
2327 2018-02-22 17:27:13 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @PressSec @VP @CNN @NewDay @sendems TRUMP Will diddle around with OBVIOUS quick fixes like Bump stocks and background checks,but will do nothing about REAL Problem,ASSAULT weapons meant to KILL swiftly and Often,like Rubio and others,he want the NRA Bucks
2328 2018-02-22 17:27:02 Pretty sure the founding fathers didn’t have anything in the constitution about Bump Stocks...so it’s only your right because no laws have already been made to stop the sale of them.
2329 2018-02-22 17:26:59 can't send u a dm dear..
2330 2018-02-22 17:26:54 I swear to you right now that if Trump follows through with supporting background checks and banning bump stocks ALL THE WAY UNTIL IT'S LAW, I will not say a bad thing about him for 2 weeks
2331 2018-02-22 17:26:52 Did he offer solutions?  I feel terrible for these people...very sad.  I am a little shocked that there aren’t many solutions being offered.... bump stocks? Ok, no impact. Mental competency tests? yes. Wait period? (These are premeditated, no). Age restrictions? Yeah.
2332 2018-02-22 17:26:37 I can see it now on the school Supply list kids are sent home with will be magazine clips and bump stocks.
2333 2018-02-22 17:26:36 It’s hard to trust what our President or any politician “endorses” (As u know). Remember them endorsing banning bump stocks after Texas?  I’m trying to be hopeful— difficult with kids in school.
2334 2018-02-22 17:26:29 You look younger in your avatar ... 1970 here. So is the one patter on /ES the same one you used on stocks?
2335 2018-02-22 17:26:19 Did VP and POTUS really call for a gun ban?   I thought they proposed banning bump stocks, moving Ge to buy guns to 21 and more vetting 
2336 2018-02-22 17:26:15 What will POTUS do about mass murders in US schools? Tweet about banning bump stocks, suggest arming teachers and ... not much else for fear of upsetting his base and the NRA which funds him & other prominent Republicans #bbcpm
2337 2018-02-22 17:26:13 Echoing PresidentTrump somewhat but nothing about stricter background checks and bump stocks ?? Trump stressed those.
2338 2018-02-22 17:26:11 So you don't know Trump. He doesn't take people's gun rights. Even if he says he is. He'll only change things to whatever the law says now since they don't always follow the written law. Not change the law. Like banning bump stocks since automatic guns are already illegal.
2339 2018-02-22 17:26:10 Do not support bump stocks ban. That bill restricts more then just bump stocks it goes after tiggers and magazines. If it’s only bumpstocks Okay but nothing else
2340 2018-02-22 17:26:09 Is it just me? I don't see an issue with expanding background checks to include mental health when it comes to gun purchases as long as the issue at hand has been adjudicated, whether it's a court or not. 

And bump fire stocks are dumb, fyi.
2341 2018-02-22 17:26:02 How do i pull that ticker up on etrade?

2343 2018-02-22 17:25:39 We all from Vegas...BUMB STOCKS weren't even involved, that's why we stopped discussing #VegasShooting #VEGAS

So why is this on the table ?
2344 2018-02-22 17:25:34 Using your logic, Bump stocks are OUR right.  Don't want one? Don't get one.
2345 2018-02-22 17:25:28 As far as bump stocks go, America is well armed enough if we do get invaded bump stocks will not make a difference
2346 2018-02-22 17:25:28 If the House REALLY wanted to ban bump stocks, this bill wouldn't still be in committee. They can pass things in a matter of days when they want to; you know it as well as I do. Look at the tax bill that was just jammed through both House & Senate in a matter of weeks.
2347 2018-02-22 17:25:16 Also boycott businesses, avoid stocks in companies that fund the NRA and gun manufacturers.
2348 2018-02-22 17:25:13 No they would not. Banning AR 15s would. Banning bump stocks would. Banning high capacity magazines would. More guns will not help.
2349 2018-02-22 17:25:09 The NRA has been so systematic with litigation. They even have any bill that's potentially passed on the state or federal level scrolling across their website like stocks.. to beat them the general public has to be that involved
2350 2018-02-22 17:24:55 Sorry, but we did not have a filibuster proof Senate back then. Majority, yes, filibuster proof, no. GOP has been in the majority for many years now. Dems have a multitude of bills on this ready to be voted on tomorrow (bump stocks, etc) but GOP is responsible for the voting.
2351 2018-02-22 17:24:51 Yeah, this post kind of invalidates any points he got for the tweet expressing a want to ban bump stocks.
2352 2018-02-22 17:24:51 Ban military assault type rifles, ban large capacity magazines, ban bump stocks. Move the fuck on
2353 2018-02-22 17:24:38 After the NRA spoke this morning to defend the Second Amendment Vice President Pence took the opposite approach and said President Trump will be pushing for stronger background checks and regulated bump-stocks. @kammerichmJ2150 #J2150CB

2355 2018-02-22 17:24:24 Ask "what make the assault rifle different"?   Answer - the 30 round magazine.   Ban the high capacity magazine and you take away the reason gun nuts prefer it.    Ban bump stocks also.
2356 2018-02-22 17:24:13 Reductions in the ability for people to defend themselves are not. Bump stocks don't enable you to do anything you can't do with your finger and a belt loop. I am opposed to banning them because it only opens the door to changing definitions to further restrict rights. Once you
2357 2018-02-22 17:24:04 Adani stocks can be buthered anytime  
2358 2018-02-22 17:23:44 Read your sentence slowly.  Then reflect on that.  One armed good guy ends it all, in less than seconds, so bump stocks and magazine capacity would not matter.
2359 2018-02-22 17:23:43 I think a good start to reducing gun violence is going through gun attachments and features commonly used in mass shootings and determining if they're necessary for home defence. Bump fire stocks? High capacity magazines? If not necessary, what's the problem with banning them?
2360 2018-02-22 17:23:37 For your info Obama approved bump stocks.
2361 2018-02-22 17:23:14 5 years later, how’s that working out for us? They couldn’t even get rid of bump stocks, and gun/ammo purchases SOARED under Obama, while schools remained unsecured.

It takes more than an Executive Order or a tweet to fix this.
2362 2018-02-22 17:23:13 Most don't realize that the advantage they have of @CryptoChoe & @Landm_Marius in the crypto market. It's practically having a cheat sheet, you don't need to be an expert in stocks, just pay attention to them. Each tweet could save you and make you money.
2363 2018-02-22 17:23:10 I didn’t say anything about semiautomatic in general.  Long barrel semiautomatic with ability to use higher capacity magazines and bump stocks. Like the ones used in mass shootings. Close loopholes for background checks, personal sales, gun shows.  I’m married to LEO. He agrees.
2364 2018-02-22 17:23:03 I take it you sold out?
2365 2018-02-22 17:23:01 As I've already said. Public sector pensions are better than anyones, so what are they bleating about? Having an 'uncertain' pension like the rest of us (dependent upon stocks and shares if private)?
2366 2018-02-22 17:22:54 Anyone know about the differences between ISO and NQSO stocks? holla at me
2367 2018-02-22 17:22:47 Almost every shooter plans to die. So this is not a deterrent. Stick with the bump stocks and the background checks. Teachers themselves don't want guns.
2368 2018-02-22 17:22:37 UATG
2369 2018-02-22 17:22:33 @waynelapierrejr you got it wrong!  This isn’t about being a Demorat or Republican, and it has nothing to do with abolishing the 2nd Amendment!  A majority of Americans, including most law abiding gun owners, want a ban on assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines!
2370 2018-02-22 17:22:26 What do you think about metal stocks?
2371 2018-02-22 17:22:21 Owning a gun isn't a right, your constitution is very open to being changed. The word ammendment means a small change... if they wanted to they could get rid of it and there's nothing you can do about it. Even at that you can own a gun, says nothing about bump stocks.

#BanAssaultWeapons
2376 2018-02-22 17:21:38 I would really like to see some rationale for things like bump stocks and assault weapons besides “it’s my right”. There is no logical reason to have these things in circulation. And 2A is not unlimited, so it’s a crap justification.
2377 2018-02-22 17:21:20 Still have to be 21 to buy a pistol. Is that unconstitutional also? Bump Stocks are an accessory not a firearm. The mental health has been law for a long time. Reporting MH issues is a sensitive issue balancing patient privacy rights and public safety
2378 2018-02-22 17:21:19 Well with a market cap this small, hopefully we’ll see gradual growth
2379 2018-02-22 17:21:10 TOTALLY AGREE. So far, the info I have been hearing is right on the mark. Ban bump stocks, raise age to 21Yrs old. FORCE FBI TO DO THEIR JOBS by ensuring that the data base INCLUDES UPDATES to the data after it has been verified as being correct.

2383 2018-02-22 17:20:27 No Anna.  Banning bump stocks.  Try to stay on point.  If you're having trouble with the word "machine gun", consider "machine gun like"
2384 2018-02-22 17:20:25 Lmao that’s what I meant
2385 2018-02-22 17:20:20 Not understanding the logic here, why ban bump stocks if automatic weapons are available anyway?
2386 2018-02-22 17:20:19 Ban Bump Stocks, Ban Silencers, Ban Future Public Purchases of the AR-15 and/or Set Age Limit For Any Gun Purchase to 21, Full Back Ground Checks on Everyone, Stop Guns Sales Online & at Gun Shows-Congress & Others Must Return All $ Received From the @NRA
2387 2018-02-22 17:20:13 -alongside mental health evaluations yearly (preferably every few months, or if you attend these evals monthly your insurance may be lowered). Then of course the more mainstream reforms of raising the legal purchasing age and banning bump stocks. Glad I could help!!
2388 2018-02-22 17:20:06 Sorry, Obama , you did nothing to curb school shooting after Sandy Hook massacre, you didn't hold a listening & talking session with real victims ! You didn't even mention  banning bump stocks! You never talked about how to raise the age of gun ownership!
2389 2018-02-22 17:20:00 Teachers are not police. They are there to teach our BELOVED CHILDREN. Police are security. Locked gates are security. Cameras are security. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS AND EXTENDED CLIPS. Raise age to 21.
2390 2018-02-22 17:19:57 Stupid me. Thought they made Bump Stocks illegal after the mass shooting in Las Vegas last year. We are so screwed.
2391 2018-02-22 17:19:54 Leave bump stocks alone. Don’t cave to liberals. Secure the schools as we secure airports and government buildings etc
2392 2018-02-22 17:19:51 What is your stance on bump stocks and assault rifles/purchase age?
2393 2018-02-22 17:19:17 Believe it when I see it. You said you were going to do something about bump stocks months ago.
2394 2018-02-22 17:19:07 happy birthday gorgeous @em_stocks  hope you’re having the best day X
2395 2018-02-22 17:19:02 I also have no problem with the potus call for a ban on the bump stocks. They are nothing but a toy in my opinion and if will help quell the discourse it is a small compromise.
2396 2018-02-22 17:18:30 There are a few things I could support, like getting rid of bump stocks and raising the legal age to 21.They need to be sure all agencies report any problems to the FBI database as well. I will not support banning any types of firearms.
2397 2018-02-22 17:18:15 The people at the NRA are Russian patriots. What don't you understand? Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, extended clips.
2398 2018-02-22 17:18:01 The Fact President Obama signed a law allowing the sale of Bump Stocks is frightening. The Fact no one acknowledges that is terrifying
2399 2018-02-22 17:17:52 Bans did work in Australia. They would work here.  As I said there are no more massacres in Australia what is the difference between them and us?  You can't buy bump stocks or automatic weapons there.  Stop the B.S. Taking away those guns dosn't violate you 2nd amendment rights.

2404 2018-02-22 17:17:10 This is a blame game, sure take our bump stocks they are stupid anyways.. then you'll come after the Armalite Rifle.. then magazine capacity. Then all guns because they are scary. Not happening.
2405 2018-02-22 17:17:05 I don’t think a blanket ban on handguns is achievable, 2A rights still enjoy broad popularity, but there are specific things that can be banned like AR-15, bump stocks, expanded mags that will make mass shootings more difficult to pull off.
2406 2018-02-22 17:17:01 Bump stocks not issue, automatic weapons are the problem. 2nd amendment says well regulated militia, we have that with our army, we don’t need these guns anymore.
2407 2018-02-22 17:16:59 nah, the ATF's determination letters on bump stocks have specifically addressed when those devices are actually used as designed. they found it legal.
2408 2018-02-22 17:16:54 He’s proposed 21 and over to own, making bump stocks illegal and making mental healthcare top priority. What did Obama change in 8 years again?
2409 2018-02-22 17:16:40 @OutnumberedFNC Bump stocks could be placed under NFA.
However age to purchase firearms should be the age of adulthood. If young people under 21 can't handle semiautomatic firearms, how can we ask them to carry full auto/burst arms in the military?
2410 2018-02-22 17:16:32 Exactly there’s nothing in the constitution regarding pump stocks so why outlaw them. Just because you don’t like them?
2411 2018-02-22 17:16:26 Let's not jump for joy too fast - he also said he was going to raise legal age of purchase and ban bump stocks.

With over 20,000+ laws and regulations on a right which "shall not be infringed," I'm tired of "compromising." We lose a little of our rights each time.
2412 2018-02-22 17:16:25 A finger squeezes a trigger faster than a human can run out a room, the ban on bump stocks is pointless, the stiffer background checks pointless. Armed stressed teachers is insane, TSA checkpoints proven pointless already. Your president doesn’t want change he wants fear!
2413 2018-02-22 17:16:19 1) Stricter Background Checks 2) Raise the age to purchase a firearm 3) Punishment of vendors / states that dont run/enforce BCs. 4) Close the "gun show" loophole 5) Ban Bump Stocks and anything like them 6) Ban "Assault Weapons -- for a start.
2414 2018-02-22 17:16:13 And Bajaj Finserv  added , now 11 of 50 stocks are Banks/Financials with 37% weightage. .
2415 2018-02-22 17:16:10 The NRA are definitely not patriots. They’d rather insult our good friends, the Europeans and sell out to our enemies, the Russians. I’m great with the Second Amendment. The NRA is approaching terrorist group status. Citizens don’t need bump stocks nor AR-15‘s
2416 2018-02-22 17:15:53 Banning bump stocks helps a little bit. Banning "assault" weapons is what is needed. Trump needs to appoint a commission of professional law enforcement people to define what "assault" weapon is.
2417 2018-02-22 17:15:46 Yes, it's hard to know which stocks to watch, and of course you can only truly watch a small number closely. But you did it for 15 years!

2420 2018-02-22 17:15:28 I don’t know why you haven’t challenged Trump about the bump stocks. Vegas shooting was last OCTOBER!?!?!? Why weren’t the bump stocks banned then? It’s because Trump is a friend of the NRA. They helped get him elected. Follow the money.
2421 2018-02-22 17:15:18 Why is everyone after the model of the gun? Bump stocks I can understand. But what will banning the model AR15 do?
2422 2018-02-22 17:14:47 @Papa_Stocks look at the daily on SURE
2423 2018-02-22 17:14:45 The concerns for the market are in the highly-valued growth stocks, also large cap industrials that are being valued at 20-25x 2019 financially-engineered estimates (2 years out!) though their natural growth rates are more like 10% - so theyre very over-valued.
2424 2018-02-22 17:14:44 Because the proposal to band bump stocks is too vague
2425 2018-02-22 17:14:37 The concerns for the market are in the highly-valued growth stocks, also large cap industrials that are being valued at 20-25x 2019 financially-engineered estimates (2 years out!) though their natural growth rates are more like 10% - so theyre very over-valued.
2426 2018-02-22 17:14:26 Maybe we should do what other countries did when faced with massacres of large groups of people. We need to ban auto/semi-auto weapons and large magazines/clips, bump stocks,10 day waiting period, minimum age to purchase should be 21.
2427 2018-02-22 17:14:23 Thank you, Heather. I just viewed the video clip of you very clearly stating your position in favor of banning bump stocks. I appreciate your quick and on point response to this important issue!

2429 2018-02-22 17:14:21 Stocks up when interest rates go down. Stocks up when interest rates go up. Who doesn’t love macro investing?
2430 2018-02-22 17:14:20 Should put bump stocks on the background checks with guns don't just ban them
2431 2018-02-22 17:14:14 The absolute least he can do is banning bump stocks or raising a age limit. It’s a start, but like only 100 yds of a marathon. This is not dramatic. This is minimal.
2432 2018-02-22 17:14:11 Exactly! He is singling out ppl with mental health problems & bump stocks are just an accessory. I do agree with the age increase tho
2433 2018-02-22 17:14:11 You had the White House the House of Rep and a 60 vote senate and chose to do nothing but screw up health care. Your side wants the topic more than fixing anything. Btw....it was your administration that allowed Bump Stocks. You chose not to act to help these kids!!!
2434 2018-02-22 17:13:52 Trump Truth: I have strongly pushed slashing funds for Comprehensive Background Checks & rolled back regs on MentalHealth & gun purchases. I have done nothing to raise age to 21 & end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress & I have not been in the mood to do anything b/c of the @NRA $$
2435 2018-02-22 17:13:45 When there is no basis for suspicion, and no one can get to the person on time, a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks should help. So a two-track process. May not work all the time, but doesn’t mean it won’t work some of the time. Even 1 kid saved would make it with it. (2/2)
2436 2018-02-22 17:13:44 Ah yes banning bump stocks and requiring universal background checks. Will the tyranny ever end.

2439 2018-02-22 17:13:07 @Emma4Change don’t let republicans or nra point to the ATF about banning bump stocks. ATF only deal with firearms. ATF response...next tweet
2440 2018-02-22 17:12:59 I don’t have a problem with getting rid of bump stocks. They’re crap anyway. I do have a problem with the 21 year old limit. My children moving out at 18 or 19 and not being able to protect themselves in their own apartment is not acceptable to me.

2442 2018-02-22 17:12:51 Thank you, Nicole for clarifying this issue. @HeatherforAZ says at the very beginning of this clip that she is “happy to ban bump stocks” but that legislation doesn’t go far enough.
2443 2018-02-22 17:12:49 You really don't understand why Trump is banning bump stocks Styx? He's doing something in the eyes of dumbocrats without really doing anything.
2444 2018-02-22 17:11:51 Please, PLEASE mean these words and live up to them! Your proposals on age restriction, bump stocks, etc. are a good start.  Mental health is both a part of this and its own issue as well.
2445 2018-02-22 17:11:47 You day traded stocks for 15 years then switched to the /ES?
2446 2018-02-22 17:11:43 Exactly, all this angst, all this shared pain, and nothing will change under the GOP. They didn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas, they didn't ban assault rifles after 6-year-olds were murdered, they won't do anything now either. The GOP sold their souls, they're a lost cause
2447 2018-02-22 17:11:43 You will not arm our teachers, that’s ridiculous !! Stand up to the NRA. No more bump stocks. Ban assault weapons !! Pass universal healthcare, mentally ill people can’t afford healthcare even with insurance.
2448 2018-02-22 17:11:30 @FHFshow @TitusNation Just call it a “Weapon of Killing Lots of People, not as much as a Fully Auto, but lots of people and then there’s Bump Stocks Too” instead of weapon of war.
2449 2018-02-22 17:11:27 this "Empire" is a too violent gun culture! Most politicians care more about making money on sales of #WeaponsofMassDestruction #AssaultWeapons and all their investment stocks in making more and more weapons! but they don't care about children!#ProtectKidsNotGuns #NeverAgain 
2450 2018-02-22 17:11:26 Buying stocks in your 20s is a smart move.
2451 2018-02-22 17:11:23 Tilly they're creating strawmen because they have no valid counter argument for why bump stocks deserve a ban. A bump stocks entire purpose is to give the semi a way to fire itself faster due to the recoil and bump stock interaction. When is that needed as a private citizen?
2452 2018-02-22 17:11:19 NRA came out with a statement after the Las Vegas shooting that they also support banning bump stocks.
2453 2018-02-22 17:11:07 @Humana 

DON'T BUY STOCKS FROM THOSE WHO STEAL FROM THE POOR! 
Protected by #CorruptFBI! Speaks volumes!
2454 2018-02-22 17:10:59 I am not against banning bump stocks. They are a novelty at best.
2455 2018-02-22 17:10:37 When you ban " bump stocks " you are blaming law abiding gun owners for the crimes of evil people. 
We are Not the problem and your 
Gun bans (gun parts ban )only disarm law abiding  citizens & make us helpless victims.
2456 2018-02-22 17:10:26 wake up head line: @realDonaldTrump  has ordered his Justice Department 2ban rapid-fire bump stocks - but officials aren't sure they can- SURE YOU CAN- and make money by making collectors pay big 2 lock case themlike they do with rare animal skins- the "demolition man" museum

2458 2018-02-22 17:10:08 @DaveRamsey what is the best way to sell individual stocks that are currently sitting at a 70% loss? buying at the lower price and average down, sell and take the loss or wait for it to hopefully to come back up? Currently in baby step 2
2459 2018-02-22 17:10:01 This point is certainly true in some cases (Clintons) but these are bad examples. $1-2M isn't very much money and Pelosi's wealth, for instance, is from her husband's ownership of RE and stocks.
2460 2018-02-22 17:09:38 Plus lower taxes- and in some cases raises. You can clear a car payment or some credit card debit/ school loans so you aren’t drownding in the interest payments. You can put that money into savings or buy stocks.

2463 2018-02-22 17:08:48 You mean like bump stocks after Vegas? Lip service is all it is.
2464 2018-02-22 17:08:44 Ah now I see what you're saying no President Obama banned bump stocks Trump took them away and now because of public outrage he hopefully will ban them again
2465 2018-02-22 17:08:37 he is the guy who first talked markets up with saying there is no better investment then equities and himself shorted massively stocks - i give a sh*t about what this guy is saying..
2466 2018-02-22 17:08:31 So you agree that the potential ban on bump stocks will have no effect. The assault weapons have to go. Thank you.
2467 2018-02-22 17:08:27 This appears to be it another bull trap.  Markets exploding and stocks barely moving.
2468 2018-02-22 17:08:23 Seen some of his talk about age and bump stocks. I stopped there.
2469 2018-02-22 17:08:16 My boss got mad at me and Adam for talking about stocks at work....
2470 2018-02-22 17:08:16 the constitution  does not protect your right to own bump stocks, and it does not prohibit gun regulations,  you should be very happy you didn't live during the time of the founding fathers, women couldn't own guns,
2471 2018-02-22 17:07:44 Bump stocks are extremely easy to fabricate so banning them doesn't really fix anything.  Better background checks is the only way to go.

2478 2018-02-22 17:06:43 So you can be 18 and die for this country, bump stocks or stupid and should be band. Your retarded ass never heard of the 3MR trigger system and others like it. What type of mental health? Yes we do need better laws.
2479 2018-02-22 17:06:38 Piers you are seriously losing credibility with me about gun control! Used to admire your stance on it! But complimenting this lunatic who epitomises how insane 50% of yanks are on their guns makes you seem weak! Banning bump stocks in the scheme of things is pretty irrelevant!
2480 2018-02-22 17:06:35 Ok...as a former NATO forces member And pro 2nd, I agree with latest proposal.  I'm used to long bursts before barrel starts to "warp", bump stocks are toy adaptations... not necessary!
2481 2018-02-22 17:06:27 Your BS & innuendo is sickening. The AR rifle is not military-grade.
Prophet Obama authorized
"Bump stocks".

The first thing out of libs like you mouths...is to stop gun sales & screw 2nd Amend.

You make people like me buy more guns. Im on my way to Bass Pro to buy a Sig 938.
2482 2018-02-22 17:06:24 Short answer. No

Context answer. Nothing of substance will change beyond the absolute minimal like bump stocks.
On the other hand they will use this to militarize schools. So kind of? But just in the worst possible ways.
2483 2018-02-22 17:06:15 The problem is bump fire stocks should have been REGULATED like an automatic weapon! As in stricter background checks, and one needing to posses a class three weapons license to own one. Your bump fire stocks represent a hole and negligence in our legal system! Fear mongerer.

2492 2018-02-22 17:05:22 @MrColionNoir hey what are your thoughts on ban the bump stock, only bump stock and get national reciprocity or no more gun free zone? I'm not for banning anything but bump stocks are useless and might bring some dems over to the right side a little? Thoughts?
2493 2018-02-22 17:05:17 Ok well half is misinformed and the other half is wrong with a dash of illegal. You do know that the NRA supported banning bump stocks from the start. Also if you think that there's a lot of death now, you ban the second amendment and you see how bad it gets.
2494 2018-02-22 17:05:15 I'd say so. I listen to VRA only. Have for years. How do you feel about energy stocks here. And of course the "bird"?
2495 2018-02-22 17:05:12 How about banning bump stocks that convert a semi-automatic assault riffle into a fully automatic assault rifle.?
2496 2018-02-22 17:04:57 I am now moving on to stocks.. I have an alert set for NQ's BO.. If it does then i will come back to check.
2497 2018-02-22 17:03:49 It’s a legal right the same as a bump stock, also not mentioned in constitution. Not debating a right to own guns, debating bump stocks.
2498 2018-02-22 17:03:42 Don't ban these assault weapons just make them get insurance for the items. Make them get extra insurance for every single gun they own and all bump stocks. Problem solved. I bet insurance companies would love support that legislation. Make them carry a million dollar policy.
2499 2018-02-22 17:03:37 @marcorubio You are not alone. The second amendment gives all law abiding citizens the right to own any type of firearm we choose, with no infringements. Cut foreign aid in half and give us TSA level school security. Leave our guns and bump stocks alone. NRA STRONG.
2500 2018-02-22 17:03:20 I see Dow up 300 points today and TSX up over 100 points. Resource stocks are flying today. The trend is your friend

2505 2018-02-22 17:02:34 No, you‘re getting me wrong, I‘m for much stricter gun laws, stop at selling rifles to adults, no younger than 25. Totally ban bump stocks of course. 
But there are more than 300 Million guns out in US now. Guarding schools will be necessary in the years to come 1/2
2506 2018-02-22 17:02:26 I hate to say this but I am boycotting the USA until gun control measures are taken. I am referring to the elimination of assault weapons and bump stocks! Tourism is going to take a big dip!
2507 2018-02-22 17:02:20 Need to watch this, you start restricting it goes too far. I get that you are just shutting people up with bump stocks, because gun control idiots don’t know anything about them. The key is mental health, why can people go into the military and use guns but can’t buy them?
2508 2018-02-22 17:02:17 Do the right thing about what exactly? Banning all assault rifles? Certain ammo, long firing clips and bump stocks?! Making our schools fortresses is NOT the way to handle this. Lets keep the firearms out of criminals hands or destroy ALL guns.
2509 2018-02-22 17:01:25 Thank you for making us aware. We have checked our stocks and this is from a different supplier. The products are safe. ^James
2510 2018-02-22 17:01:13 There’s literally debate about bump stocks. Why? There’s no point beyond speeding up the rate of bullets... what ‘responsible gun owner’ needs that? Who can’t go without that? 3/?
2511 2018-02-22 17:00:50 The President told Sessions to write a memo on Bump Stocks. What is that, it’s meaningless. Why didnt he tell Congress to pass a law to ban Bump Stocks? Once again, Lick the can down the road. Let’s see the memo!
2512 2018-02-22 17:00:46 So let’s have bump stocks and let another Las Vegas or Florida happen....sounds like a great way to defend the 2nd amendment. I like living. I enjoy being alive and if bump stocks are our RIGHT?!? Then I don’t wanna be American. I’m moving to Japan
2513 2018-02-22 17:00:35 We need to make it harder to get a gun. “A well regulated milita” means exactly that. We need to eliminate the sale of assault weapons, bump stocks and huge ammo magazines. In short, we must make it harder for someone to go hunting for people.
2514 2018-02-22 17:00:25 Is it your right? No where in the constitution does it talk about bump stocks. Just that you have a right to have a gun. But how many guns and what kind of guns can and should be regulated. Other than because “it’s your right” what is a real reason for have a bump stock?
2515 2018-02-22 17:00:24 Armalite rifle.

2516 2018-02-22 17:00:03 They can join Military and die for us at 18, but can’t own a gun, that BS Sir. If that’s the case, don’t allow libs to have 1. Don’t appease socialists. Look at what can be done to make schools safer. Hire vets, that’s what the do, protect us. Bump stocks, ok, don’t need them.
2517 2018-02-22 16:59:50 Pretty sure bump stocks aren't listed in the constitution... #idontthinkso #NeverAgain #EnoughIsEnough
2518 2018-02-22 16:59:46 Some financial article, I semi follow them through the stock app. I look at a lot of tech stocks honestly.
2519 2018-02-22 16:59:45 .@TrueFactsStated This is what I was tweeting to you about bump stocks.  ATF/Executive branch has no authority to do so, and Trump knows that.
2520 2018-02-22 16:59:35 The kickback is more ardently against raising age and banning bump stocks. Background checks are good, including violent mental illness is good, if the government can handle it correctly. They have lacked thoroughness and completeness though, so I don't trust them to do it.

2526 2018-02-22 16:58:55 Don’t get me wrong I generally hate the guy. His motives are probably not great but he’s willing to cross the @NRA which if he were to get bump stocks banned it would be a start. But I also know not to get my hopes up. We’re still in for three years of hell.
2527 2018-02-22 16:58:48 This doesn't make sense. Do I need to declare my stocks too? Why is it different?
2528 2018-02-22 16:58:45 FINALLY! I’m a republican and I strongly agree with every point you just made. If you have to be 21 to take shots of tequila, you have to be 21 to shoot/own a gun. And who the hell needs bump stocks anyways?? #CommonSense #GunControl

2530 2018-02-22 16:58:35 Scare tactics...Let's get behind Trump and raise minimum age to buy guns, ban bump stocks, increase background checks!
2531 2018-02-22 16:58:34 Maybe schools should take Trump up on his offer and request large stocks of needed school supplies like pencils, pens and paper to "make targets for target practice".
2532 2018-02-22 16:58:28 Considering Lax Vegas with the bump stocks I would agree with you, though I would expect it to be highly uncommon compared to an AR-15 someone can buy in any major city. Most mass shootings are just semi auto weapons.
2533 2018-02-22 16:58:23 Bump stocks don’t matter. It’s just a pawn, a novelty. They’re not going to change anything with that.
2534 2018-02-22 16:58:23 Except allow bump stocks, which Trump had to take away... So who is the worst president? Everyone hates on trump but he technically did more than Obama on gun control so far.
2535 2018-02-22 16:57:52 Also, the old men with 50+ guns with bump stocks and enough ammo for an Army brigade.
2536 2018-02-22 16:57:41 I don't think background checks are the slippery slope.  Bump stocks are because it's a technique more than a distinct object and could easily lead to banning semi-automatic. Banning certain rifles is because they are only used in a couple hundred murders a year, handguns next.
2537 2018-02-22 16:57:18 @Chocobo shorts are trader betting against the stock. So they sell high by borrowing stocks from their broker.
2538 2018-02-22 16:57:07 Oh, please. Was the earlier tweet about background checks, increasing purchasing age and banning bump stocks insincere? Wayne and NRA minions have no decency. Patriots don't push bump stocks that turn semi=auto weapons into killing machines. They've never done the right thing.
2539 2018-02-22 16:56:55 Oh come on gonna take away bump stocks? Anyone that knows what a bump stock is should know how stupid that sounds lol. Besides, I’ll just get one off the black market if they ban em

2543 2018-02-22 16:56:40 NRA backs the banning of bump stocks. I support the @GOA and think more people need to wake up and realize the NRA is very iffy on a lot of issues. The #Commies are never going to be happy until the #2A is a page in the history books
2544 2018-02-22 16:56:21 I mean I own guns, along with zero desire to harm someone. And that’s the case for a LOT of people. I can definitely say there is no need for people to have automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. and the buying process for sure needs work.
2545 2018-02-22 16:56:13 no you can't , that is infringing, but I am ok with better checks, ending bump stocks, and ending gun free zones.
2546 2018-02-22 16:56:08 Another "Great people on both sides" situation here, huh?  Since you are now advocating for more guns and arming teachers, I can only assume you are towing the NRA line.  Trade bump stocks & background checks for MORE GUNS!  Yee haw!
2547 2018-02-22 16:56:07 Goodbye bump stocks... 21 years old to buy a firearm legally.... what happens when an 18 year old wants to kill and goes to the black market? I’ll take an armed security guard or teacher
2548 2018-02-22 16:56:02 Sir, I believe you are going to find the majority of Americans are going to very strongly disagree with raising the the legal age and outlawing bump stocks. Two of the few things I disagree with you on

2550 2018-02-22 16:55:38 Muddy the waters, hyperbole, misinformation, tiny concessions that U make a big deal of (like bump stocks), unrealistic solutions that will never happen (like SWAT teachers), tough talk, & above all huge  campaign contributions plus STALL, STALL & STALL some more. NRA play book.
2551 2018-02-22 16:55:36 @marcorubio it's simple. assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity ammunition don't belong in civilized society
2552 2018-02-22 16:55:31 You’ll get nothing of any substance done.  You can’t even ban bump stocks, so do you really think you can do anything to regulate this? Quit lying to the American people. The NRA owns you and they’re going to tell you to throw everything in committee to die.
2553 2018-02-22 16:55:21 Trump wants to ban bump stocks; ATF doesn't know if it can: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has ordered his…
2554 2018-02-22 16:55:19 Scripted or not, No more Hypocrites! This IS Choose Life! NOBODY at ANY AGE (NOT IN MILITARY BATTLE) should be able to own AUTOMATIC ASSAULT KILLING MACHINES Nor BUMP STOCKS!  It’s Common Sense! Nobody has demanded NO guns, of NRA & Right not infringed upon!

2557 2018-02-22 16:55:04 What's the NRA's ideology these days?
They oppose background checks, are pro DV-perpetrators owning guns, oppose research into guns/gun violence, promote gun-seller agenda aiming to arm ppl to the teeth w/ accessories like bump stocks. They're not pro-2A, they're anti-society.
2558 2018-02-22 16:55:02 Bump stocks are useless, they make your accuracy go down 10000% 
2559 2018-02-22 16:54:54 Stocks shedding some gains from the earlier highs.
2560 2018-02-22 16:54:34 don't take away our bump stocks!
2561 2018-02-22 16:54:28 So it was the bump stocks that killed those 17 innocent souls?  Well that should about do it then, no more mass shootings everyone!!!
2562 2018-02-22 16:54:23 Here is what I hear people asking for:  Regulation of assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines.  I see NO ONE suggesting a repeal of the 2nd amendment.

2565 2018-02-22 16:54:13 @narendramodi Sir Hospitals or Hospital chain should not be allowed to list their stocks, even if allowed (for expansion) not for providing EPS/ Dividends to shareholders. EPS should be zero. Health care should not become a supernormal profit business.
2566 2018-02-22 16:54:06 Stocks go up and down. I believe in both company’s for the long run March should be a better month for $sx $idk
2567 2018-02-22 16:53:50 Walking out won't help End Gun Violence, Gun Control won't help End Gun Violence, Gun-Free Zones won't help End Gun Violence, and Banning Bump Stocks won't help End Gun Violence. I seriously don't know how we End Gun Violence.
2568 2018-02-22 16:53:38 Who benefits from arming teachers? Gun manufacturers and the NRA. Who pays congress? The NRA. If the grifters-in-chief at the White House start buying gun stocks, it could happen.

2570 2018-02-22 16:53:11 And 2010
1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

3. NO lobbying effort by the NRA, Republicans or conservatives for legalizing bump stocks. This was team Obama's decisions
2571 2018-02-22 16:53:08 senator marco rubio  The second amendment gives all law abiding citizens the right to own any type of firearm we choose, with no infringements. Cut foreign aid in half and give us TSA level school security. Leave our guns and bump stocks alone. NRA STRONG.
2572 2018-02-22 16:53:05 I'm OK with banning Bump Stocks, but an AR-15 is NOT an assault rifle.  It is a semi-automatic Modern Sporting  Rifle.  I have a friend that use one to help keep down the fox population, plus she depends on her AR-15 to make a living doing taxidermy.
2573 2018-02-22 16:53:04 Bump stocks aren't your "right".
2574 2018-02-22 16:52:59 @cybex_global do you know where in London stocks the Eezy s please? X
2575 2018-02-22 16:52:54 Why weren't bump stocks done after Vegas? Why aren't u condemning the Flo House for voting down even a debate on gun control? Or those smearing these shining stars of students? This is a weak minimal response that pretends like something is being done. Get rid of the ARs today!
2576 2018-02-22 16:52:41 Pretty clear that their real motive is "more guns would be sold." The NRA isn't about protecting the 2nd amendment, it's about making money for gun manufacturers. (BTW some teacher pension funds own those stocks.)
2577 2018-02-22 16:52:39 I will be strongly pretending to push Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health and which Cable News Network the buyer most watches. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to again pretend do something on this issue - I hope!
2578 2018-02-22 16:52:31 Bump stocks are assanine. I've fired several types of fully automatic weapons and bump stocks mimic this ability.
2579 2018-02-22 16:52:27 529 is best, IMO, because no limits to contributions but options are SUPER limited, not really any idea what you own. ESA can pick stocks but $2,000 max contribution.
2580 2018-02-22 16:52:27 And you know when they say $970k that's just a base salary... he must be hauling in tens of millions with his gun manufacturer stocks.
2581 2018-02-22 16:52:27 Hey Joe, no one said they can't. They will be able to buy a gun. They would just need to follow the law in order to do it. Those laws should be amended, no bump stocks, all guns registered, no mentally ill owners and be 21 to start with
2582 2018-02-22 16:52:18 He wants to raise the age for ARs to 21 and get rid of bump stocks- which the NRA is open to. He is doing basically nothing.
2583 2018-02-22 16:52:14 I don't personally care whether they ban bump stocks or not but little by little they will erode our rights until we have nothing.  This is another symptom of blaming the gun in my opinion
2584 2018-02-22 16:52:12 (cont) I tend to like selling puts on stocks that are already down a lot & the gap down is the capitulation… not the start of a new move.
2585 2018-02-22 16:51:50 Bump stocks aren't the issue. We already have background checks, and the shooter from Florida passed his background check. The FBI is at fault here. The people in charge of the Miami field office should be fired for their incompetence.
2586 2018-02-22 16:51:42 What leads to exclusion from the index?
A list of new eligible stocks is drawn up to review against the current index constituents twice a year and in case any changes are to be made, then the smallest con stituents are excluded and new stocks replace them.
2587 2018-02-22 16:51:36 Bump stocks are a novelty. Truth be known if the Vegas shooter would not of been using one the casualties would of been more. Ban or don't I don't care. Enforce the laws we have. If you are mentally ill u should not be able to get a gun. If mentally ill medical help should befree
2588 2018-02-22 16:51:22 Notice every time long bonds rally US stocks outperform, and every time long bonds sell off,  US stocks outperform. In current environment long bonds are not hedging US equity risk...Mental gymnastics still required to find reasons for holding long bonds here...
2589 2018-02-22 16:51:07 Beware of token proposals by NRA pawns to ban bump stocks and raise age limits. These are less than bare-minimum steps. The strategy? When the next mass shooting inevitably happens, they'll say "we did something and it didn't stop the bad guy. No more gun laws." #VoteThemAllOut
2590 2018-02-22 16:51:06 Bubbles what? Stocks still GREEN 
Everything is good
WTF bubbles 

Bubbles since blah blah blah

It's iron bubble.
Never burst
2591 2018-02-22 16:50:54 Bump stocks have nothing to do with 2nd amendment so a regulation of them is not an issue. The issue is to not lose the ability of all law abiding citizens from having any legal gun.
2592 2018-02-22 16:50:26 Don’t recall the second amendment mentioning bump stocks.
2593 2018-02-22 16:50:09 Big mistake! The bump stocks will be gone as fast as your base.
2594 2018-02-22 16:49:53 Banning all assault weapons, bump stocks and guns capable of firing multiple rounds per minute would be a starting point. Helping prevent these weapons getting into someone's hands is the only answer.  After the fact, your are too late.
2595 2018-02-22 16:49:47 too bad u didnt HEAR WITH UR HEART.  ban assault rifles AND bump stocks, raise the age, thorough mental background checks with dr
2596 2018-02-22 16:49:46 If schools are a target, banning bump stocks, assault rifles isn’t enough. I want armed security. I’ll gladly pay higher taxes to protect our students from killers, not just against assault rifles.
2597 2018-02-22 16:49:44 Bump Stock isn't a gun lol. So it isn't protected, it isn't a right. And Bump Stocks practically do turn a semi automatic into an automatic.
2598 2018-02-22 16:49:43 knowing oil go up with $UWT MTF  u would prefer find small medium cap oil stocks instead of $UWT bz small cap outperform more
2599 2018-02-22 16:49:38 Today on @CNBC the consensus was #stocks up 10% for 2018

2600 2018-02-22 16:49:30 No but it is easily turned into one. Hence banning bump stocks
2601 2018-02-22 16:49:24 At least bump stocks aren’t really much of anything imo, but still trying to appease the swamp/jackasses too much here
2602 2018-02-22 16:49:03 Woohoo @stejbee we can go back to pretending we understand stocks and investments once a week.
2603 2018-02-22 16:48:58 Penny stocks yu can get 100% gains some days , the whole crypto mania prolly done imo unless bitcoin pass 10k today . But it's still some cryptos dat mite do sumthin .
2604 2018-02-22 16:48:56 They were in support of the bump stocks before and age to me is common sense. So we will see.
2605 2018-02-22 16:48:53 3/4 #3. Oct 2017 Sen. Feinstein introducing bill to ban bump stocks after Vegas shooting.
2606 2018-02-22 16:48:53 Declining to regulate due to lack of authority isn't approving.

Even so, now is Trump's big chance! Be a leader and ban bump stocks! Undo something the black guy tacitly condoned!
2607 2018-02-22 16:48:37 So many convinced that FOMC minutes were "hawkish" because stocks tanked late-day! Not a chance, this market still has Fed in its corner! Confirmed!
2608 2018-02-22 16:48:36 do all that. & sit back to watch the next group of people die from an assault weapon. banning bump stocks wouldn't have helped anybody at the school in florida. even if by some miracle (not holding my breath) you banned assault rifles. it won't stop.
2609 2018-02-22 16:48:34 WHO R U PLANNING 2 KILL. CHILDREN IN A PARK? SCHOOL? SHOPPING CENTER, GROCERY STORE. WE DO NOT NEED BUMP STOCKS OR ASAULT RIFLES IN OUR SOCIETY. IF U WANT  SHOOT THEM GO JOIN US ARMED FORCES & FIGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. GUNS DON'T BELONG N CIVILIZED SOCIETY. THEY R PEOPLE KILLERS.

2611 2018-02-22 16:48:20 Bump stocks aren't THE issue, but if it helps get something done, I'm not against it.
2612 2018-02-22 16:48:16 AR 15S and bump stocks are for hunting really.   well I guess if hunting people counts
2613 2018-02-22 16:48:08 I'm fine with improving background checks, I'm fine with getting rid of bump stocks, but I'm not happy with increasing the age of rifle ownership to 21. If we trust 18-year-olds with joining our armed forces, we should trust them with exercising their Constitutional rights.
2614 2018-02-22 16:48:06 Raising the age is going to far. Banning bump stocks is different I don't support a total ban on them though
2615 2018-02-22 16:47:55 FBl didn't do their job ! Don't take it out on gun a activists!
Don't fall prey to the leftist agenda sir ! 
Leave bump stocks alone !!!!!!!!!!

2617 2018-02-22 16:47:33 bump stocks are novelty items that just help you waste expensive ammo.  Many "gun people" didn't even know what they were until Vegas. Banning them is for show and a fake "win" for libs. Bumpfiring is rapid-fire technique that does not require a bumpstock.

2620 2018-02-22 16:47:26 Most americans want a number of common sense reforms to try and limit availability of assault rifles, high capacity magazines, universal background checks, loopholes, bump stocks etc.  Responses like this are what stops any of it from happening.
2621 2018-02-22 16:47:25 Age makes no sense and banning bump stocks is stupid unless you're going to ban shoe strings as well
2622 2018-02-22 16:47:15 Panic setting in in stocks...
2623 2018-02-22 16:47:03 Banning bump stocks is just the beginning. By the end of it, he'll be tabling an assault weapons ban and I bet you all will find a way to rationalise yourselves into that, too.
2624 2018-02-22 16:46:52 Well they're going to prevent bump stocks now. And high caps. 

Both of which you can 3D print at home or weeks in your garage. 

When will folks address the fact that people that use guns to kill people aren't going to obey the laws they pass?
2625 2018-02-22 16:46:37 All guns should be legal to be used for protection!  
Any gun is an assault weapon if used to assault people!
Abortions kill (assault) more people than all guns.  Let's make abortions and bump stocks illegal!
2626 2018-02-22 16:46:36 So.. Stocks are up today cuz yields are down? Not watching TV today so I need to know the story.

2628 2018-02-22 16:46:27 while I support the 2nd amendment I feel that there's a strong need for better background checks, limiting Assault style weapons, bump stocks.  Most Americans don't know most murderers don't use Semi-Automatic weapons but controlling them is need.  Mental health checks mandatory.
2629 2018-02-22 16:46:22 Listen to the videos of Las Vegas shooting. What you hear ARE NOT BUMP STOCKS, THEY'RE MACHINE GUNS! Any expert can tell by the sound.
2630 2018-02-22 16:46:18 he’s meeting with lawmakers today on school safety, he’s imposing comprehensive background checks w stronger mental health checks, he’s pushing to raise the purchasing age to 21, he’s pushing to ban bump stocks.

2633 2018-02-22 16:46:11 I hate trump but im glad hes at least for raising the age limit and banning Bump stocks. Its a start but we are coming for the ARs with high capacity too.
2634 2018-02-22 16:46:10 No President Trump!.............
Bump stocks aren't the problem at all !

2635 2018-02-22 16:46:03 Bump stocks have no  civilian applicatiion.
2636 2018-02-22 16:45:55 The question should be asked why did obama make these bump stocks legal?
2637 2018-02-22 16:45:52 I dont hate the NRA the majority of its members support common sense reforms. Wayne please explain why children, people on Do Not Fly List, & mental disabilities need ARs w high capacity mags, bump stocks & unlimited ammo or any gun? Common sense isn’t exploitation
2638 2018-02-22 16:45:39 It’s going to take state referendums to make safer guns laws. The current US Congress & Senate are lip service only. NRA is a hollow, gun manufacturers lobbying group. Not the one I knew as a kid. Bump stocks, silencers, mega-magazines, CCL, Assault rifles. Unnecessary risks.
2639 2018-02-22 16:45:35 Marco Rubio, if you want to be a leader then now is the time! Believe in yourself and stand with these Children! They know and you know that ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS AND LARGE MAGAZINES HAVE NO BUSINESS ON THE STREETS IN OUR COUNTRY!!
2640 2018-02-22 16:45:19 Also, he can't ban bump stocks because those are under the jurisdiction of the ATF.  He would have to have Congress change that rule, then agree to ban bump stocks, so that is just an empty promise that he cannot fulfill.
2641 2018-02-22 16:45:12 Why would I want to move to Australia? That will not stop the killing here.  Now isnt that a stupid comment?  Get rid of the semi automatic weapons and bump stocks and no one needs to die here.  Your comments are sad.  You don't care about the children here.
2642 2018-02-22 16:44:58 i am by no means a trump fan, but i am glad he is endorsing a ban on bump stocks and raising the age to buy weapons.  i still don’t think it is enough, but it is a first step.  and i hope he follows through on it.
2643 2018-02-22 16:44:50 Taking guns away is never gonna happen . What can happen is vetted buyers, must be 18 to purchase gun, ban bump stocks, and no more “ gun safe zones” ( that’s where 90% mass murdering happens). At least it’s a start.
2644 2018-02-22 16:44:40 Any steps taken to reduce availability of semi automatic guns would be a plus. Ban bump stocks, raise minimum age, require much tougher background checks. And when @FBI starts whining about not enough $$$ oh well. Smarter ppl than Rubio have suggested this before with no action
2645 2018-02-22 16:44:11 Really @VP  then stand up to the NRA ban bump-stocks, ban Assualt rifles like AR-15 NOW!  Fix gun regulations,  over 21 to buy gun & screening for mental health issues.  Taking away weapons of war like AR-15 is not taking away the Second Amendment! DO NOT LET NRA $$$ rule you!
2646 2018-02-22 16:44:09 Banning "bump stocks" will only "inconvenience" the mentally ill. The plans for bumps are all over. Any clever person could craft one from plans. There are also other devices that can purchased and used for the same conversion. Get to the root cause please.@chucktodd
2647 2018-02-22 16:44:07 Trump can think only about one thing.  How's the stocks doing now......lol
2648 2018-02-22 16:43:29 Hopefully with the things we can all or most all agree on. Better background checks. Ban bump stocks. And raising the age of purchasing an AR or similar style rifle to 21. Securing schools which is more of an immediate solution seems to be more difficult.

2650 2018-02-22 16:43:16 God first is in her bio.   Had to know that was there.  Because God LOVVVVEEESSSS guns.  Ammosexual 1:15 And Jesus said "Get ye a bump stock, for I saith it is they right."  And then Jesus turned many of trees into bump stocks for his flock.
2651 2018-02-22 16:43:02 You can't end sale of bump stocks. Only congress can do that. <aybe you should read up on how the government works. Or maye you know that, but you think we will believe you really can. Just more of your BS!
2652 2018-02-22 16:42:50 I own bump stocks; it's for comfort only, and doesn't make someone a better shooter. With silencers, unless youre talking distances of around 1000 kilometers, no, it's not difficult to hear and know position... the decibel drop is minimal. Sorry, that's facts.

Guten tag.
2653 2018-02-22 16:42:44 Banning "bump stocks" will only "inconvenience" the mentally ill. The plans for bumps are all over. Any clever person could craft one from plans. There are also other devices that can purchased and used for the same conversion. Get to the root cause please.
2654 2018-02-22 16:42:42 The NRA is using the Russian Play Book, trying to pit one American Against Another, Using Race & Anything Else that will work! We must not fall pray to these tactics & try to work together! Eliminating Assault Rifles, Bump Stocks & Large Magazines, Will Save Lives! Why Object?
2655 2018-02-22 16:42:38 @POTUS and @NRA - terms like "crazy" & "sicko" are not helpful & further stigmatize mental illness. What is crazy & sick is the gun culture, the availability of war tools, the gun show loophole, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, arming teachers, & putting guns before kids.
2656 2018-02-22 16:42:27 @theresa_may Whatever turmoil is now created, in revenues across the world. With the slum in oil prices, stocks and shares rise and fall. They were initiated by you, YOU were asked to get it looked at. You ignored it and now, you have been advised to act. Why did you ignore it.??
2657 2018-02-22 16:42:26 Who mentioned bump stocks? Anyway she can just 3D print her own since your busy body gun grabbing self likes to mind her business.
2658 2018-02-22 16:42:22 They give u money and u return the favor by keeping to their agenda. Like, not banning weapons of war (which u can do w an EO) and arming more ppl, like teachers. Hands r being forced now, so u do the minimum. Bump stocks should've been done after Vegas. We do understand.

2661 2018-02-22 16:42:10 Which ones are you looking for? Also, limited stocks for most books.
2662 2018-02-22 16:42:04 Long story short....the culture is what’s changing not the gun. Parenting is changing not the gun. Mental illness is getting more and more inflicted not the gun. Bumper stocks isn’t a problem the person pulling the trigger is the problem. Dui is still number 1 in kills.
2663 2018-02-22 16:42:02 I love America and I voted for Trump.  It's a Win Win babe! I support the Constitution.   AND I agree to certain regulations concerning guns.  The NRA wanted bump stocks regulated before.
2664 2018-02-22 16:41:30 When did the civilian use of bump stocks protect our freedoms?
2665 2018-02-22 16:41:22 I vote to make abortion illegal!  Abortions KILL more people than bump stocks & guns!  We are talking about using some other form of "protection"!
2666 2018-02-22 16:41:18 First you’re talking about bump stocks, now you’re talking about the kid with the AR-15. I agree that that person should not have been able to purchase the AR-15 and, although I don’t support it, I would be fine with increased background checks. This happened because the FBI.
2667 2018-02-22 16:41:18 He’s saying anything except “ban”. NRA talking points: mental health, bump stocks, arm teachers. 

Nobody knows what Trump specifically means by Comprehensive Background Checks. 

Raising the age will never pass and Trump knows this, but he’ll blame it on Congress.

2670 2018-02-22 16:41:05 @realDonaldTrump It wasn't bump stocks, or the #AR15, or drugs, or @NRA or lack of gun control that led to #ParklandSchoolShooting. The corrupt @FBI and #BrowardCountySheriff FAILED TO DO THEIR JOB! #EnforceCurrentLaws
2671 2018-02-22 16:40:56 Banning bump stocks is a drop in the ocean. If they actually manage to get that done, it’ll be solely to silence the gun control wave. “What more could you want, we did this one tiny thing”
2672 2018-02-22 16:40:50 I doubt the right gives in one bit and the left won't stop until an all out rifle ban. No compromise in Washington. There's many, like myself, who's fine with banning bump stocks and upping mental health checks. I think that's the eventual outcome, no bans on actual guns tho.
2673 2018-02-22 16:40:38 I’m certainly not saying guns need to be illegal. You have to look at the facts around the deaths, school shootings are at an alarming rate right now - there’s things we can to do help impact this. Bump stocks seems like an easy win to me, not sure why anyone would fight this one
2674 2018-02-22 16:40:31 Really? In what way? How was your Stocks doing? Getting any money back and you check? What do you think about that black unemployment? I could go on. He has done more in one year than Obama did in eight. We are so lucky he is our president!!’

2676 2018-02-22 16:40:28 You know what I find hilarious. I didn't hear a PEEP when Trump orders a ban on bump stocks. Not even a "Well at least he did something" instead when he ruins that moment, is by saying "Let's arm teachers", everyone loses their shit. 
To be honest, we shouldn't have bump stocks.
2677 2018-02-22 16:40:20 C'mon, kids. Keep up the pressure. Age is being addressed, background checks, banning bump stocks but NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ADDRESSING BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS! If they are not sold, no worry about them!
2678 2018-02-22 16:40:06 1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

3. There was NO lobbying effort by the NRA, Republicans or conservatives for legalizing bump stocks. This was team Obama's decision.
2679 2018-02-22 16:40:05 This statement is misleading at best. Yes, the O admin approved bump stocks,  but did so bc the ATF determined it had to under current law and that bump stocks could not be regulated. The O administration rolled out a number of restrictions, which are being slowly reversed.
2680 2018-02-22 16:39:57 It's not bump stocks that are the issue. Those things are useless for people who are actually trained to shoot. The issue is the change in the ATF's definition of "machine gun" and how it would ban a lot more than bump stocks.
2681 2018-02-22 16:39:56 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2682 2018-02-22 16:39:47 Because Obama's DOJ said bump stocks were legal and the President can't do anything about it.  That would be Congress, but they haven't done anything when they had a Democrat majority either.
2683 2018-02-22 16:39:32 Look back in history on all the times that bump stocks have protected our freedoms. Don’t be silly, they’re very very important
2684 2018-02-22 16:39:31 If you want to look back in history thats fine. If you dont want to update gun laws, shouldn't update guns. Use the guns that were being used when that law was created and we have no problem. Pretty sure bump stocks were what they were thinking when they wrote it
2685 2018-02-22 16:39:30 All that rhetoric from trump; all those moronic tweets and nothing about the guns it is really unbelievable that he cannot go there. That nonsense about bump stocks was a do nothing comment. He only did that so he could blame Sessions if it comes up again.
2686 2018-02-22 16:39:25 How about a 2 for 1:
21 to buy a gun and ban bump stocks in exchange for term limits. 
We'll find out who the real deep state swamp dwellers are.
2687 2018-02-22 16:39:23 Asking where the Constitution talks about bump stocks, is moronic and rhetorical. The bump stock issue is a fake issue, only meant as a DOOR  OPENER for OTHER BANS.
You're a good disciple of Hitler.

2689 2018-02-22 16:39:13 Ive been with you 100% in everything you’ve done but please don’t let progressive leftists muddy your thinking. Bump stocks are clumsy and hard to use and almost impossible to aim. What we need is God and morals back in schools and to stop the ignorant war on all things good.
2690 2018-02-22 16:39:12 Wait, will you let the teachers have bump stocks?  You need to BAN yourself from talks about school safety!  #notmypresident #manchild
2691 2018-02-22 16:39:04 Once again in these days of ETFs don't buy individual stocks. Leave them to professional investors like hedge funds & mutual funds. Run away from trouble.
2692 2018-02-22 16:39:02 1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

2693 2018-02-22 16:39:02 Liar. 

Bump fire stocks are gunstocks that are specially designed to make bumpfiring easier, which allows semi-automatic firearm to mimic the firing speed of fully automatic firearms. They can achieve rates of fire between 400 to 800 rounds per minute.

2696 2018-02-22 16:38:27 Changed the channel also. Those nra people do not care. Period. Raise age to acquire gun, AR and bump stocks illegal. WTF is soooo bad wit that?  DO SOMETHING
2697 2018-02-22 16:38:04 Raise the age of gun ownership to 21 and ban bump stocks?  Yeah i am ok with this Mr President....just an FYI, just because a multipurpose rifle looks military, it doesn't make it an assault rifle...look at the definition.
2698 2018-02-22 16:38:04 Why do we need a bump stocks?

Don’t get bogged down with accessories. 

If people have fast fingers so be it. Then bump stocks aren’t needed.

2707 2018-02-22 16:36:48 One of the few people with a reasonable list. I like it. But automatic weapons are already banned. Since 86'. Bump stocks gotta go.
2708 2018-02-22 16:36:45 States already started banning bump stocks, so you are just trying to get credit for that. You last year lessened mental health checks, so stop the BS
2709 2018-02-22 16:36:43 As for political suicide, I think it’s political suicide to say mentally ill deserve guns, remove healthcare to help mentally ill, and fail to restrict the most extreme weapons (bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc). That’s a recipe for mass shootings.
2710 2018-02-22 16:36:34 Did Trump say he would ban bumper stocks? Yes but only after pressured. Let’s see if he does or if the NRA has him by the balls.
2711 2018-02-22 16:36:31 1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

3. There was NO lobbying effort by the NRA, Republicans or conservatives for legalizing bump stocks. This was team Obama's decision.
2712 2018-02-22 16:36:30 They aren't scared enough.  Gun stocks are up today.
2713 2018-02-22 16:36:29 Why not ban all assault rifles and all bump stocks?? No one needs assault rifles!
2714 2018-02-22 16:36:29 For example - was last night's town hall a success? Yes if the goal is to help energize Dems w/ a base strategy for midterms. If the goal is federal legislation beyond just banning bump stocks it did damage to your cause. Youthful enthusiasm is no match for experience.

2718 2018-02-22 16:36:01 You accepted $30 mil from the NRA. Unless you are going to ban assault/semi-assault guns & bump stocks, then I don't believe you are going to actually get anything done. #parkland #BanAssaultWeapons

2721 2018-02-22 16:35:37 Don't ban bump stocks. They are toys, and are damn near useless to hit a target accurately anyway.  Do consider pushing the Hearing Protection Act and National Concealed Carry Reciprocity.  And end Gun Free School Zones!!  They don't work!
2722 2018-02-22 16:35:25 "is tech overvalued? - CNBC

2723 2018-02-22 16:35:00 The Las Vegas shooting, involving bump stocks (as well as a severe tactical advantage by the shooter) injured 851 people in addition to killing 58. An astounding number of casualties. Makes a legal semi-automatic rifle perform more like an illegal automatic one.
2724 2018-02-22 16:34:50 yeah it's definitely not hard to do. I'd definitely like to see any form of automatic modifications banned, especially bump stocks/trigger cranks.
2725 2018-02-22 16:34:42 Why do you guys want to ban Bums buying Stocks?
2726 2018-02-22 16:34:41 @realDonaldTrump the "right thing"?-Great! so they are now supporting the ban on assault weapons,bump stocks,trigger cranks and high capacity magazines and supporting 10 day waiting periods and a universal background check system? Awesome! Let's spread the news everyone! @MSNBC
2727 2018-02-22 16:34:39 Com'on @POTUS don't do the political double speak. Ban bump stocks. Increase background check requirements, raise the age of who can by certain weapons. And when @FBI starts whining about not having enough $$$ to do the work...force them to do it. Tired of excuses by DC losers
2728 2018-02-22 16:34:39 You have no earthly idea how many more would have been killed in Vegas if the shooters were not using bump stocks. No real rifleman would even bother with such a waste of money.
2729 2018-02-22 16:34:31 "Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!" GOP controls all branches of government. Leaders do not "HOPE". They LEAD! Put pressure on Congress and use your bully pulpit to speak out. Can you do that?
2730 2018-02-22 16:34:25 Well we could start with... 

1) Require universal background checks for every gun 

2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases

3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

4) Mandatory All Guns be Smart Guns.

2739 2018-02-22 16:33:04 Bump stocks have nothing to do with the Parkland shooting, that was two national shootings ago.
2740 2018-02-22 16:32:59 Someone should investigate how many Democrats hold stocks with gun makers!! They sure seem to increase sales of firearms with ever tragic event!!
2741 2018-02-22 16:32:59 .@SenSchumer Thank you for backing @SenFeinstein’s bill to propose a ban on bump stocks. The House voted 50 times to repeal the ACA, knowing they wouldn’t be successful, but they sent a clear message. As your proud constituent, I applaud and encourage tenacity on this issue.
2742 2018-02-22 16:32:59 Not to mention bump stocks are more/less ridiculous. So this is a safe concession.
2743 2018-02-22 16:32:58 Bump stocks don’t make a gun a machine gun, just helps you pull the trigger faster. 
2744 2018-02-22 16:32:58 Bump stocks and the murderer's age didn't cause 17 deaths. Look at the justice system installed by Obama and Holder that allows juveniles to skate on crimes so they don't have a record before 18. Cruz was beneficiary of this & is reason he was able to get a gun at 18. No record!
2745 2018-02-22 16:32:57 THIS is what you say after meeting with survivors and families of the Florida High School massacre ? SHAME on You @potus. Ban bump-stocks,  make more thorough background checks, mental health care!
2746 2018-02-22 16:32:34 Arming teachers - any teachers - IS "giving guns".  What prevents a couple of yahoos from tackling a teacher & grabbing a gun? Let's arm the adept students, too!! Stocks will rise!!
2747 2018-02-22 16:32:30 C'est... tentant...

2748 2018-02-22 16:32:22 Real or not. Real estate, bonds, stocks even gold. All the true gains happened before 07. Even gold was $1000 in March 08. The dow was 14,000. There hasn't been any legacy gains in real estate since 08
2749 2018-02-22 16:32:21 Why the sudden change? This is mere damage control on your part. I've never seen such interest in addressing gun violence and as usual, you're trying to exploit it for your benefit. And bump stocks, a non-issue, any semi-auto can be bump fired without a special stock.
2750 2018-02-22 16:32:06 Full auto are basically illegal. Bump stocks and such should never have been allowed. Military doesn't give troops the right to carry
2751 2018-02-22 16:32:05 I'm not for gun control, but could you tell me why you thing banning bump stocks is a bad idea?
2752 2018-02-22 16:31:58 GUN CONTROL NOW. No bump stocks, no assault weapons, 100% bacground checks. #GunControlNow
2753 2018-02-22 16:31:53 GUN CONTROL NOW. No bump stocks, no assault weapons, 100% bacground checks. #GunControlNow

2755 2018-02-22 16:31:46 Tilly, If you want to have an abortion, then it is legal to have one. If you want a bump stock, then it is legal to get one! If it was not legal to have either, then they would be gotten illegally. I vote, make bump stocks & abortions illegal, use some other protection!
2756 2018-02-22 16:31:18 The NRA is fine with changing age of purchase. 18 year olds don't buy many guns. Gunmakers don't sell bump stocks. And the NRA loves to promote wider and weaker background checks. No gamechanger in sight.
2757 2018-02-22 16:31:15 More likely they would have put the local sheriff and FBI agent in the stocks for criminal incompetence.
2758 2018-02-22 16:31:02 If you get rid of bump stocks move age to 21 & comprehensive background I will throw my support behind you sir.
2759 2018-02-22 16:30:56 You want a bump stock because it’s your right? Where in the constitution does it mention bump stocks and fully-automatic military-grade assault rifles? Face it: you have absolutely NO NEED for a bump stock.
2760 2018-02-22 16:30:54 @realDonaldTrump oh please We are not fooled easily. We know who you are. Crocodile tears, pledges of action but like everything else you will cave to your base - a few meaningless gestures like banning already illegal bump stocks then back to NRA biz as usual
2761 2018-02-22 16:30:49 I am Christian Liberal leaning non-gun owning stay at home Dad neo-hippie. I am fine with guns for protecting oneself but I think better background checks, eliminate semi auto weapons and bump stocks OR maybe a special license that requires training to own semi auto.....
2762 2018-02-22 16:30:43 PSU Banks such as SBI and Canara bank can bounce from recent lows .
2763 2018-02-22 16:30:42 Where your machine gun? Oh that’s “right” you have no right to that... Flintlock single shots are all you have a right to and in a well regulated militia (the police). The founding fathers didn’t have semi-automatic weapons or bump stocks... “Any firearm” is NOT in the 2A...
2764 2018-02-22 16:30:39 "When Democrats do propose gun measures, they're...ant steps. One side  has 'give us all the guns all the time fuck you libturds' and the other side has 'maybe we should ban bump stocks?'. You can't really build a  big  movement around that." --@Atrios
2765 2018-02-22 16:30:23 Which is 100% more than any other administration has done. Trump is going to get the age to buy raised to 21 and bumb stocks made illegal. Every democrat should be in support, and hopefully the needed amount of Republicans.
2766 2018-02-22 16:30:16 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!  - DJT - let’s see
2767 2018-02-22 16:30:06   Keep dreaming and telling yourself that. they've been trying to do that for decades. Isn't gonna happen. You can have the bump stocks I don't give 2 shits about those lol if that will make your liberal ass happy you can have em.
2768 2018-02-22 16:29:55 I can't believe how idiotically naive I was.
When I heard 45 wanted to ban bump stocks, I thought he might actually accomplish it. Not because he's a competent leader who cares about doing the right thing...
2769 2018-02-22 16:29:45 Full auto?  Sigh. It’s not full auto that we need to worry about, it’s things just shy of that.  Let’s ban double action triggers and bump stocks.  It’s a start.
2770 2018-02-22 16:29:32 Bump stocks aren’t protected by the constitution
2771 2018-02-22 16:29:17 Yes - and it would restrict (for LACs) the possibility of self-defence for quite many young women, and men. Finland instated a similar ban, of age 18, after shootings in 2007 and 2008, in both cases by over-18 assailants. As symbolic as it gets. Except for the bump stocks.
2772 2018-02-22 16:29:09 Oh stuff it Chuck ., you 2 band wagon idiots don’t do anything but parrot the latest crisis and adopt it as your own fix ., Please  Feinstein bill to ban bump stocks lol ., Why haven’t you done this before 2018 ., Obama allowed them in 2015
2773 2018-02-22 16:29:06 Only if you raise voting age to 21, and bump stocks should not be touched.
2774 2018-02-22 16:28:58 I’m checking my stocks you still checkin for dem bitches
2775 2018-02-22 16:28:54 Prior to the LV shooting, I had ltd knowl. of gun laws (background checks, assault weapon ban, bump stocks, age req.) loopholes & the NRA Agenda

After research, I am appalled at what I’ve learned.

U.S. gun laws are laughable. 

GOP candidates & elected officials are NRA WHORES.
2776 2018-02-22 16:28:38 Not opposed to these but I can hook my thumb into my belt loop and cycle my ar at full auto speed bump stocks are not the problem but carry on wipe the ass of the democrats if you must
2777 2018-02-22 16:28:26 Better background checks and violent mental illness needs to be accounted for.  Raising age is a tough sell, probably won't help.  Ending bump stocks is between bad and really bad depending on the wording, could include match triggers. Government has failed to stop more shootings
2778 2018-02-22 16:27:50 Ummm-no. He’ll pass an EO on bump stocks to say he did something.The courts will overturn it.Instead of passing it through Congress which would make it law of the land. He hopes it will take time & people will move on before we realize we’ve been duped & he’s still in bed w/NRA.
2779 2018-02-22 16:27:36 Exactly! Every moment we spend on this nonsense proposal is a moment we aren’t spending talking about banning assault weapons, bump stocks, high-cap magazines, etc.
2780 2018-02-22 16:27:33 アイキャラ3って番組おもしろいかも
2781 2018-02-22 16:27:31 Just in: Dem lawmaker Wendy Brawley files bill that would ban sale of bump stocks, high capacity magazines and assault weapons.
2782 2018-02-22 16:27:27 Funny how all the smart money in the world suddenly decided to buy stocks today.
2783 2018-02-22 16:27:11 I’m complaining about the lack of clarity on “gun reform.” What are we talking here? Universal checks - agreed. Bump stocks - get rid of them and anything that turns a semi into an automatic weapon. I’m all for that.
2784 2018-02-22 16:27:09 Sign a executive order this week.

Bump stocks are not enough.  You know it.  We all know it.
2785 2018-02-22 16:27:04 Good day for stocks
2786 2018-02-22 16:26:53 I’m banning bump stocks. We’ll arm teachers.  The NRA will do the right thing. 
Yup, I’m friggin senile.

2789 2018-02-22 16:26:41 Shall not be infringed.

Being mentally ill is too subjective for such a measure, and anyone at the age of majority (able to vote) is protected by the 2nd. Bump stocks aren't even a weapon and this would be equivalent to trying to ban pistol grips or a scope.
2790 2018-02-22 16:26:23 Nope.....not going with that. NRA contributes MILLIONS to politicians to do their bidding. NRA is not getting all of this $$ just from membership dues, it's from gun manufacturers to push sales. Strict, strict gun laws are needed. More than banning bump stocks & military style.
2791 2018-02-22 16:26:10 Agenda:                                                         •Band Bump Stocks.                                        •21 yrs old to purchase gun                    •no guns for teachers.                                  •independent gun dealers more restrictions

2793 2018-02-22 16:25:46 Wait just a minute. Didn't I hear the NRA spokesperson Dana what's her name say just last night that the NRA supports expanding background checks and banning bump stocks and a few a other things I can't remember, but which sounded nothing like the divisive videos she stars in
2794 2018-02-22 16:25:42 When you see a SWAT team breaching a building, most of them carry some version of an M4 or a sub-machine gun like the HK MP5. Why do you think that is? Stocks and foregrips improve accuracy. And yes, accuracy is important especially in tight quarters with lots of bystanders
2795 2018-02-22 16:25:42 Banning bump stocks and silencers change nothing. Bump stocks are purposed for nothing more than adjustable comfort. The silencer lowers the decibels only by a little, and doesn't make it laughably like the movies depict. HighMag capacity definition changes per person.
2796 2018-02-22 16:25:41 Agreed, my Twitter BFF, but I highly doubt it will happen.  Maybe a ban on bump stocks, but nothing meaningful.
2797 2018-02-22 16:25:17 Will @VP have the guts to speak up for gun control, ban on assault weapons, large magazines, bump stocks?  Doubtful.
2798 2018-02-22 16:25:16 So, you've already abandoned your gun reform ideas that they didn't like - background checks, banning bump stocks, etc? Predictable but it didn't take long.
2799 2018-02-22 16:25:03 Glad to see your comments on better background checks & ending sales on bump stocks. Your strong support for arming teachers, however, would accomplish 2 things: (1)makes teachers the immediate target, (2)worsens our already big teacher shortages
2800 2018-02-22 16:25:01 Meet me at stocks park
2801 2018-02-22 16:24:48 Stop meeting. Start doing. You can ban bump stocks before the opening bell on Monday. That would be a great start. Please be my president, even though I didn’t vote for you.
2802 2018-02-22 16:24:36 Anyone who thinks that trump will actually do anything about bump stocks or age restrictions is living in la la land.
2803 2018-02-22 16:24:27 #VelshiRuhle Gaslighting? Come on, that's the NRA guiding principle. Our citizens will still have THOUSANDS of other guns to choose from after we reinstate the assault ban & ban bump stocks. All they will lose is the ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. That's it.
2804 2018-02-22 16:24:16 17 humans were slain in the latest school shooting. Now there is a proposed ban on bump stocks and up to 200 assault rifles. There are 3,000+ more firearms which are not being banned. We need at least 150 more mass shootings before all firearms are banned, or 2,550 human souls.
2805 2018-02-22 16:24:08 What I said is illegal? Like...the words I used? Yes. Purchasing the parts for a fully auto are illegal. Purchasing parts like bump stocks which baaaaasically make them automatic is legal. So, you know. You can split hairs on semantics, or you can just admit when you're wrong.
2806 2018-02-22 16:24:05 So what are your proposals? Just do nothing? Trump wants to ban bump stocks. Good Trump. Like Rubio said last night, he’s changing his mind on magazine capacity limits because fewer people might have been killed. There’s nothing wrong or bad about wanting to limit casualties.
2807 2018-02-22 16:23:37 Bump stocks not the problem.
Age of the shooter is not the problem.
Repeal Gun Free Zones. Allow people 2 defend themselves & others. 
Guns ARN'T the problem. People are.
Blunt Objects (Bats, Crowbars, etc) kill more than guns. OH I actually mean people wielding those weapons
2808 2018-02-22 16:23:25 His husband legalized bump stocks......
2809 2018-02-22 16:23:14 The only part of this I fully agree with is background checks. Bump stocks sure if it only refers to banning the accessory itself and nothing more. Raising the age to 21 for guns will have more negative repercussions than positive ones.
2810 2018-02-22 16:23:13 Trump met with the kids, teachers, and parents something Obama never did with the families of all the law enforcement officers killed during those yrs and give Trump credit he is calling for ban on bump stocks and other measures and yes Ii want Trump as the face of this nation
2811 2018-02-22 16:22:54 But do you know the NRA got full autos banned ? They gave us rhe NICS system, and they are the ones who suggested bump fire stocks be regulated. If anything you and the people who hate the NRA should thank them lmaooooo.
2812 2018-02-22 16:22:46 i really hope @realDonaldTrump sticks to his guns so to speak on eliminating bump stocks and raising the legal purchase age. small steps but positive ones. if he wants to leave a positive legacy this could be the start of it

2815 2018-02-22 16:22:34 All mass shooters isn't the issue at hand, neither is 'biggest' or 'worst', don't conflate.
18 - 20 years old doesn't imply the basic level of responsibility it used to, despite some exceptions. Bump-stocks are gimmicky crap. Better background checks aren't a bad idea.
2816 2018-02-22 16:22:07 My first questions on gun restrictions would be: (1) who the hell legalized bump stocks in the first place and who uses them and what for, and (2) who needs 17 rounds in a pistol and 30 rounds in a rifle or 10 rounds in a shotgun?

2823 2018-02-22 16:20:32 I’m not on board with it. Who decides who’s sane enough to own a gun? If you’re old enough to March to war at 18 you should be old enough to own a gun in the land you’re protecting. You can do whatever you want with bump stocks, I don’t care.
2824 2018-02-22 16:20:31 Lol.. come on bro... I trade stocks like that.. lol
2825 2018-02-22 16:20:30 Besides the background check I don't agree with this. Leave the bump stocks and raising the age is pointless. Also if you can vote and go to war for your country at 18 you should be allowed to buy
2826 2018-02-22 16:20:15 Yes, there are millions of real Americans who believe as you do. We do not have to oppose the second amendment or try to take all guns away; all we need to do is limit access to assault weapons and huge clips, and ban bump-stocks.

2828 2018-02-22 16:20:05 Bumb stocks seem cool to play around with,  i was in the military it you get a thrill when firing them will there be licensed places to fire them for leisure?
2829 2018-02-22 16:19:41 I must re read the Constitution again - I missed any reference to right to bear bump stocks last time I read it.
2830 2018-02-22 16:19:41 Ban ALL assault weapons, fund high risk outreach counseling, tough bg checks, jail for illegal guns and corrupt dealers, no bump stocks, danger to self or others automatically in fbi database. Vote out those who take nra money.
2831 2018-02-22 16:19:33 gun control and banning bump stocks won’t solve school or mass shootings. U need people in schools with guns to stop a shooter

2833 2018-02-22 16:19:29 Keep your handguns and shot guns and hunting rifles. 
I think the semi auto types will be banned along with bump stocks and magazines that hold more than ten rounds. If you need to shoot semi auto guns join the military!

2837 2018-02-22 16:19:02 I think trump will. I think responsible gun owners will support it. I would support harsh penalties for gun owners who do not secure their weapons and life is lost as a result. I am for banning bump stocks and suppressors. I dont know a single person that are against any of that
2838 2018-02-22 16:19:00 If they didnt hold stocks in this gun company, maybe the shooting would have been avoided

2845 2018-02-22 16:17:57 Universal background checks (closing gun show loophole)
Banning assault rifles
Banning high capacity rounds (bump stocks)
Repealing the Dickey Amendment (that bans CDC study of gun violence)

This is not the goal. This is step one.

-Raise age to 21 to buy guns (agree)
-Ban bump stocks (agree)
-Arm some teachers (disagree - i'd add trained guards)
-Stricter background checks (agree)

3/4 aint bad.

2849 2018-02-22 16:16:37 @MeghanMcCain is right - there’s a difference between bump stocks and assault rifles. What she didn’t mention is that there is no reason for civilians to have either of these weapons of slaughter @TheView

2853 2018-02-22 16:15:46 I think the congress should inact a new law allowing the use of handheld grenade launchers by the public. Why are we wasting time with semi automatic assault rifles like the AR-15 and bump stocks? When the use of launchers would be so much more effective. What do you think ?????
2854 2018-02-22 16:15:41 Mental health checks- Good.
Raise age - bad - We give 18 yo Full auto in military and also does this mean the new age prevents 18 yos from going into law enforcement? If not then whats the difference?
Bump Stocks - Only cause gun jams. Put thumb through belt loop boom bump stock
2855 2018-02-22 16:15:37 Every facility that declares to be a gun free zone must be held responsible for protecting of any attack.  
Any mental health gun ban must be done by local control commission.
bump stocks are frivolous. Still wondering Los Vegas shooting, who did it & if FBI is partly responible
2856 2018-02-22 16:15:35 Keep talking, the NRA will be right behind you.

Passively blaming it on first responders is vile, stupid, and wrong.  Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. They are both made to do one thing - kill people.

2861 2018-02-22 16:15:01 No I’m not. The NRA organization that promotes and lobbies for legislation is determined by their leadership. Most people think bump stocks should be banned, the NRA doesn’t. I don’t believe the NRA represents the position of many of its members.
2862 2018-02-22 16:15:01 Wayne, there is no reason for ASSAULT WEAPONS BEING SOLD TO AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THERE IS NO REASON FOR BUMP STOCKS, THERE IS JUST NO REASON!! NO REASON!!!
2863 2018-02-22 16:14:55 The only reason bump stocks exist is because of the POINTLESS machine gun ban passed in 1986.  In 1934, Gov. regulated machine guns (National Firearms Act), putting in place mountains to purchase one.  That completely ENDED machime gun crime.  They had to be.....
2864 2018-02-22 16:14:55 You will give lip service,make bump stocks illegal,change the age,an do more background an mental health,none of that slows down sales,nor does it stop those that already have these weapons,I don't know the answers,but you claim to be a genius. do something to prove it or S.T.F.U
2865 2018-02-22 16:14:48 Funny, Trump says: he will get rid of bump stocks ~ then gun fanatics go crazy buying them up. NRA pushes talking points that Liberals hate 2nd amendment and it strikes to those gun fanatics. So, off to the store they go and gun sells go up.

2867 2018-02-22 16:14:44 My child's RIGHT to safety out weighs your right to own your little toy. Every precaution should be taken to protect our youth. Bump stocks should be banned no questions asked. They should of never been legal in the first place.
2868 2018-02-22 16:14:20 I don't necessarily believe we could win. I believe we have a natural right to try. Haiti is the only other country I can think of that did similar to what we did, and they get extra points because it was the slaves not the colonists. 

And yes we can ban AR-15s and bump stocks
2869 2018-02-22 16:13:52 no they werent.. im all for extending the wait period, upping the age to 21 and ban bumper stocks.. but you have no idea what you are talking about with the ar15.. question how many nra memebers have shot up a school?
2870 2018-02-22 16:13:48 How about a national vote? Not on control measures, on barrels or stocks. Think bigger, it's win win for you. If the gun nuts win, hello re-election. If they don't then Donny, boobalah, at current rates you just saved millions of lives in the next decade....
2871 2018-02-22 16:13:42 This could all be solved if Congress would just pass legislation banning bump stocks. EVEN IF you think they’re already covered by existing law, why not pass a bill making it clear? Legislation would prevent future administrations from revoking bump stock bans administratively.
2872 2018-02-22 16:13:37 Not sure of others, but your nifty levels have helped me to get decent profits trading my stocks, I couldn’t capitalise directly on your nifty or your stock levels but appreciate your efforts in posting regularly thank you!
2873 2018-02-22 16:13:26 Trump actually said he wants bump stocks in semi automatic rifles banned just 2 days ago.
2874 2018-02-22 16:13:22 Looking back into history we didn’t have bump stocks & AR-15!
We are fast becoming like ISIS - everyone out holding a gun now?
And where’s your trust in the military then?
2875 2018-02-22 16:13:21 AR15, AK47 both that can be shot at full auto without bump stocks or the fucking rubber band trick!! Recoil is the key! I’m 70 years old, have had guns since childhood! Anyone that needs that shit to hunt game, can’t shoot for shit, or just want to slaughter, period!
2876 2018-02-22 16:13:21 Into crypto or just robinhood app?  Youll need to have the app and until crypto is available to your state youll only be able to trade actual stocks which is still great.

2878 2018-02-22 16:13:10 How naive are the people to think they can end school shootings like the #FloridaShooting by banning the AR-15 or bump-stocks ! killers will just use a different weapon ! only a person with a gun can stop a shooter. #cnn
2879 2018-02-22 16:13:04 Exactly.  And how many of those instances had a decade of ZIRP policies from the Fed preceding them?  All these tweets and articles basically saying, "low rates were great for stocks, higher rates might be even better" are beyond comical.
2880 2018-02-22 16:12:49 Alright. We filled the losses from yesterday. Up 1% in the Dow and 0.8% in S&P. Bonds rallied parallel since the market opened and just changed directions going down again. I expect a sharp decline in the bonds for the next 2 hours followed by the stocks 60 min to closing.
2881 2018-02-22 16:12:47 Ok so they are great people. Hopefully the NRA is having conversations re. Bumper stocks, background checks etc.
2882 2018-02-22 16:12:24 Thanks for making that distinction. I think we give on bump stocks, age 21 for semi auto rifles, more comprehensive reporting to NICS, but get concealed carry reciprocity and allowance for trained teachers to store/carry firearm in schools.
2883 2018-02-22 16:12:22 Nice trading Trend Slinger...
2884 2018-02-22 16:12:21 Banning bump stocks seems a bit narrow, perhaps token. Maybe we should widen the focus to include all weapons that have no legitimate purpose beyond killing a lot of people quickly. The writers of the 2d amendment had no concept of such weapons, nor is it a right to "recreation".
2885 2018-02-22 16:12:20 Stocks up nicely this morn after selling off quite a bit late yesterday. Still looking like sideways range to me. TREND STILL DOWN, HEDGE ON, stops on the hedges coming down. Enjoy the ride!
2886 2018-02-22 16:12:14 He already asked his administration to ban bump stocks, something your hero, President Obama, failed to do. But you wouldn't report that...why do so many people have such low regard for journalists?
2887 2018-02-22 16:12:00 We've have good amount of interest on them so far. We plan to keep adding to the page and keep older cards even more accessible to everyone as long as our stocks permit. :D
2888 2018-02-22 16:11:46 and also called for bump stocks to be made illegal and raise the age to owner a firearm, hey cnn scripted any more questions way to go, but not a shocker remember democratic primary hahaha
2889 2018-02-22 16:11:44 It's pretty sad when asking for a ban on AR-15, bump stocks,and silencers is considered an extreme idea.Meanwhile,I hope you were watching Dana Loesch saying the media loves mass shootings and excoriating the Florida kids at CPAC. You may understand why dems are being pushed left
2890 2018-02-22 16:11:39 Remember market main goal is to confuse us and separate us from our money. Always have a plan for up, down and sideways. What would you do in all three scenarios? How are you protecting your capital? Trade well. $SPY $QQQ #markets #stocks
2891 2018-02-22 16:11:38 Read the room. This is by far your worst idea ever. Teachers are educators. They don't want the responsibility of making the decision to take a life. Nor should they. Ban bump stocks. Ban AR15 and other assault weapons. Tighten background checks.
2892 2018-02-22 16:11:23 Every moment we spend on this nonsense proposal is a moment we aren’t spending talking about banning assault weapons, bump stocks, high-cap magazines, etc.
2893 2018-02-22 16:11:13 I am a retired high school teacher. Arming teachers is not the answer!!
Eliminating bump stocks is not the answer!!  Get rid of assault weapons that allow people to kill so many in such a short period of time!! That's the answer!!! PLEASE!
2894 2018-02-22 16:10:56 Shows his incentive to keep pushing guns, but he's a true fanatic, a true believer that the Gov wants to come get your guns, that fear sells millions of guns. I'm afraid Trump will do background checks & bump stocks & everyone will clap & go back to normal, it's an easy out 4 NRA
2895 2018-02-22 16:10:50 This is the same madman who told Trump not to go after bump-stocks after the Vegas shooting!!!!!! 

2896 2018-02-22 16:10:49 Stop the BS we can’t stand it anymore ban assault weapons, enforce federal background checks, ban bump stocks etc etc this ain’t rocket science.
2897 2018-02-22 16:10:41 All this conversation about AR-15s and AKs and bump stocks is painful and beautiful and necessary. But it is also statistically dishonest.

The vast, VAST majority of gun deaths within the US is because of handguns & 60% of those deaths are suicides. #GunControlNow

2901 2018-02-22 16:10:18 People really mad that Trump wants to ban bump stocks?
2902 2018-02-22 16:10:15 NO “Bump Stocks” were used in the Florida school shooting! What we need is for the FBI to do their damn job!! We need the schools to be protected just like you are Senator!! When are you people going to learn No Gun Zones are DANGEROUS TO OUR CHILDREN!

2909 2018-02-22 16:09:46 Dude!.. come on the Don!. Bump stocks really
What difference will banning them do..
I'm dyslexic.  I will now loose my gun.. I have no criminal record.. ?. You are pandering to the enemy.. sort the majority liberal commie teachers in the schools, colleges and gov.
Get themout
.
2910 2018-02-22 16:09:30 The use of a bump stock seriously degrades accuracy limiting use to very close quarters. Guns not designed for higher rates of fire will jam unless allowed to cool. Bump stocks are a novelty item. "Bump" operation of a gun can be achieved without a bump stock.
2911 2018-02-22 16:09:18 If you are demanding action on “bump stocks” then any logical rebuttal includes the fact that one can easily expend as many rounds through simple magazine changes or a finger and a belt loop. It’s called arguing w/logic as opposed to hyperbole and emotion.
2912 2018-02-22 16:09:17 Like wow, really? They had THREE types of guns?? That really changes everything. Let’s keep ARs and bump stocks and whatever else legal then
2913 2018-02-22 16:09:06 Don’t see anything about a right to bear bump stocks in the constitution.
2914 2018-02-22 16:08:57 Yet more than half of the school shootings were by guns not bought by the actual shooter nor did any of them have bump stocks ! Sounds like a widdling away if the 2nd amendment to me !
2915 2018-02-22 16:08:44 That's not good.. Ban stocks if us want but please use common sense..Shame if they raise age for sale of weapons but not age of military service.. Kinda nonsensical..
2916 2018-02-22 16:08:34 The assult weapons are not available to the public. They are just guns with different stocks! A knife is still a knife but if you change the handle does it make it a murdering knife? You need a real lesson in guns!
2917 2018-02-22 16:08:26 So, Trump has signed a referendum to determine whether or not to ban bump stocks AND gun sales were down 8% last year, but people are still saying that Trump (republicans) are against #guncontrol. 
2918 2018-02-22 16:08:22 When I heard #45 mention bump stocks to these families, i thought it was a sign of dementia from #45.
2919 2018-02-22 16:08:22 Is that why the NRA is supporting regulation of fire modification like bump stocks?
2920 2018-02-22 16:07:53 @realDonaldTrump is violating yet another campaign promise...Will the minimum age to join the military also be raised to 21 or will those under 21 in the military carry sticks or toy rifles? 
Rubber bands and belt loops can be used to mimic bump stocks. Will he ban those next?
2921 2018-02-22 16:07:30 Conversation is bump stocks - not guns.
2922 2018-02-22 16:07:29 graphite stocks are facing pricing pressure frm government.. it seems
2923 2018-02-22 16:07:17 IOW, Rubio is mostly for the status quo. Unless there is effort to reduce stocks of these or their ammunition, to tightly control ownership or transfer, nothing will change.
2924 2018-02-22 16:07:14 Situation is normal, it's a correction no need to panic. Value of stocks are retained and not lost into misery, like Rs 100 become worth Rs 20.
2925 2018-02-22 16:07:04 Introduce a bill to undo the legal immunity you helped grant gun manufacturers.

Introduce bills to ban bump stocks, large clips, and any gun with the capability of shooting bullets as rapidly as an AR-15.

You have a job in the Senate. Use it to, you know, pass bills.
2926 2018-02-22 16:07:04 Ban high capacity magazines and weapons and bump stocks and only then will there be any chance of safety
2927 2018-02-22 16:07:01 Offensive is ban assault rifles, strengthen background checks, raise purchasing age, eliminate bump stocks, etc. Basically, cut into your largest campaign donor’s profits. You won’t do anything.
2928 2018-02-22 16:06:59 Could we all agree on 4 things. 1.  Van assult weapons2.  National fugun registration 3. Ban bump stocks. 4.  All fun shows buyers must have back ground check and register their guns.
2929 2018-02-22 16:06:59 Shoot. That’s just salary. He’s a multi-millionaire from all the bonuses and stocks he gets from the gun industry. All the NRA is, is an advertising/propaganda arm of the gun industry. Read their newsletters & magazines and it becomes crystal clear.
2930 2018-02-22 16:06:56 @Stash is adding ability to buy fractional single stocks. How will @stockpile respond?
2931 2018-02-22 16:06:55 oh so you DO have a 2A agenda? And it is? By supporting outlawing bump stocks? #SHALLNOTBEINFRINGED! PERIOD.
2932 2018-02-22 16:06:49 In other words more Guns is his solution. 

He owns a whole lot of stocks in the gun industry. 

Murderer !

What kind of company would play on that for profit?
2936 2018-02-22 16:06:20 If we have to walk around in this country like we walked around in the 1800s how is that progress
Guns in schools are not the answer
There the problem. 
BTW bump stocks had NOTHING to DO with this ATTACK.

2939 2018-02-22 16:06:08 Your wonderful people in the NRA are going to try to stop the legislation that raises the age to 21 and end the sale of bump stocks. Will you stand up to them? Or accept their money and bow down?
2940 2018-02-22 16:06:02 Different font use brush fonts u don’t always have to do their background on their Yt channel.. like I said just download some stocks from free gfx packs and I think you’ll be good bro I’ll teach you a lot more when we collab!
2941 2018-02-22 16:05:45 My family has always been Republicans,but we never felt the need for assault rifles or bump stocks to protect ourselves. The safety of children at school and the safety of every law-abiding citizen is a much more important right than your so-called right to have assault weapons.
2942 2018-02-22 16:05:43 Have you not been paying attention or are you just that dull? Background checks. Mental health reform. Ban bump stocks. Allowing the CDC to do research. EVERYTHING LaPierre is against. That is the solution.
2943 2018-02-22 16:05:39 アイマリンプロジェクとくっそ強いですよ
2944 2018-02-22 16:05:24 Even in WWII when clips/mags were available, armies stuck with bolt action rifles. Magazines/bump stocks etc are for firing indiscriminately. Which isn't about target shooting or hunting or even self defense. You trade speed for accuracy, so that argument is bunk.
2945 2018-02-22 16:05:23 Nothing new from this guy!  He wants to create hysteria that this about eliminating the 2nd Amendment.  He doesn’t speak for most Americans, including a majority of law abiding gun owners.  We want assault weapons, bump stocks & high capacity magazines banned!
2946 2018-02-22 16:05:15 Hi Anna, sorry but you have a right to keep and bear arms, not bump stocks.
2947 2018-02-22 16:05:13 When we can say "Ban bump stocks" but the right/NRA says "but you can make them yourself" we've forced them into stupid positions. When we can say "Ban mags larger than 10 rounds" we can force them to say "but it only saves 3 seconds" we can say "but 3 seconds can save lives."
2948 2018-02-22 16:05:07 John.. you are very weak on real principles.  Protect schools with armed security, metal detectors, and allow teachers to conceal carry.  Banning bump stocks does nothing but give communists a win.
2949 2018-02-22 16:05:03 Did anyone catch the NRA Chief. He blamed the shootings on everything except the purchase of military weapons.  Australia stopped massacres by banning automatic weapons.  The NRA just lied and said we wan to take away 2 nd amendment not true just Bump stocks & automatic weapons.
2950 2018-02-22 16:05:02 … conveniently forgetting the 10X number of biotech stocks that went from $150s to $20s saying similar things.
2951 2018-02-22 16:04:34 What will keep criminals from using bump stocks? This puts the ppl at a disadvantage.
2952 2018-02-22 16:04:33 Why arm and train teachers? Have a current or retired law enforcement  officers who are already adequately trained, placed in every school, raise buying age, ban assault weapons, and ban bump stocks.
2953 2018-02-22 16:04:17 And basically you have proven that u dont look at the issues rationally. U just hate trump for trump, even though u admitted obama was worse then trump concerning deportations and not acting about the bump stocks
2954 2018-02-22 16:04:14 AG Jeff Sessions: In addition to banning bump stocks, "we're looking at a number of things” as part of response to the #FloridaSchoolShooting
2955 2018-02-22 16:04:07 Hmmm . . . bullish EIA report will buoy stocks outside of transports and hurt DXY. Bonds and stocks rising at same time. Everybody wins! That cannot last.
2956 2018-02-22 16:04:04 Why don't we make Psychopaths ilegal why bump stocks and if Congress is in the mood to do something why don't we start with putting Hillary and Obama in jail
2957 2018-02-22 16:04:00 What did I say that was false?  Is it false because you don’t agree with it? Or perhaps you don’t know that about bump stocks?  If not you should look it up.  That meeting did take place yesterday because I watched it.  So I think it’s you who is spreading false information.
2958 2018-02-22 16:04:00 .@NRA not doing right thing. Why rn't they supporting bans on bump stocks? Why rn't they supporting ban on assault weapons? Why r they attacking Nancy @NancyPelosi? What does she have to do w anything other than advocating for #SensibleGunControl? Wayne is a disgusting person.
2959 2018-02-22 16:03:50 Why arm and train teachers? Have a current or retired law enforcement  officers who are already adequately trained, placed in every school, raise buying age, ban assault weapons, and ban bump stocks.

2965 2018-02-22 16:02:57 Then why do they lie? No one wants to do away with 2A or the guns. Just assault rifles, bump stocks, large capacity magazines and the like. Raising age to 21 and GOOD background checks would also help.
2966 2018-02-22 16:02:55 yes on 2 occasions. Again-you are welcome to do some research before you voice an opinion. Btw - how hypocritical are you for condemning Obama for his work against the gun lobby and not condemning the fact that even after LV, the trump admin has done nothing about bump stocks.
2967 2018-02-22 16:02:49 One thing you can clearly see: there is a rush among fund managers to own IT stocks. It's like defensive positioning for 2018. A trend that started in Oct 2017 now widely established

2982 2018-02-22 16:01:15 Don't buy into Trumps statements on age restrictions or bump stocks. They're empty platitudes meant to shut you up. Keep moving. Stay angry. Kick them all out of office.

2985 2018-02-22 16:01:05 I’m sure they don’t get all the guns out or keep them out. But they make it harder to get a gun, and impossible to get guns that cannot be passed off as anything other than tools for mass murder (assault weapons, bump stocks etc)

2991 2018-02-22 16:00:33 Arming teachers is a stupid idea. They are (under) paid to teach; not carry or use guns.

Solution: ban bump stocks, restrict weapons such as AR-15 to armed forces & trained militia, min age for purchasing guns, background checks, waiting period, restrict private sales of guns...
2992 2018-02-22 16:00:32 Doesn't matter, pistol grip alone makes it illegal, and slidefire stocks are also illegal in California, ten round mags or not.

2995 2018-02-22 16:00:21 So, unless we dial back the existence of magazines, it won't matter. Now, pro-gun people like to nte the AR5 is like a hunting rifle, but it begs the question why hunting rifles don't have bump stocks (or do they), and if the AR15 is banned, will gun MFGs solve bump stocks them?
2996 2018-02-22 16:00:04 not to mention that their response was completely out of context. no one mentioned clips or bump stocks.
2997 2018-02-22 15:59:58 she didn't answer the kids question either, "Would she approve of banning bump stocks and Assault weapon sales" they needed to tell her to answer Yes or No, same w/ Rubio's answer re; taking $ from NRA

2999 2018-02-22 15:59:52 What part of "shall not be infringed" do you not get? Bump stocks are a tool, a gun is a tool, and murder is an action perpetrated by a criminal. Outlawing bump stocks is like outlawing spray paint to stop graffiti.
3000 2018-02-22 15:59:51 very first time im tracking this setup and BAM working to a T.  (stocks up 60% no red days and goes red on day for short and possible gap down)  $GEN up 65% no red days goes red at 1.60 today dropped straight to 1.30 now we see if gaps down!!  n love and ez borrow
3001 2018-02-22 15:59:46 bump stocks aren't the problem. and if they can make pipe bombs, they can construct a stock themselves too. most get weapons from parents anyway. changes nothing. you loosened restrictions on mental health. also unless you invest in treatment, it's not helping at all
3002 2018-02-22 15:59:30 @realDonaldTrump DON'T YOU DARE BUCKLE UNDER TO THE RADICALS ON GUN CONTROL....If you give in even one little bit they will sense weakness and will be like wolves on sheep. Fist it will be bump stocks, then AR-15's, then all semi-autos, then ...
3003 2018-02-22 15:59:18 But are you? Bump stocks aren’t enough. AR-15s need to go. Get off your high horse, stop tweeting like a tween and DO SOMETHING.
3004 2018-02-22 15:59:15 I doubt you have ever shot a .45, 9mm pistol.  In 42 states, 60 and 100 round mags and bump stocks are legal for AR-15. How long do you think you would last with your 15-shot pistol against that firepower? Yours is an idiotic idea.  #NRABloodMoney #NeverTrump #neveragainmovement
3005 2018-02-22 15:58:48 Every civilized country knows how to solve this. It's not children, schools, mental illness, bump stocks or whatever. ITS GUNS

Hundred/s of years since colonization, war of independance & wild (clue) west. No other country has a part of their constitution saying GUNS for  all
3006 2018-02-22 15:58:37 @NRA LaPierre, like #45 @realDonaldTrump can only speak in hyperbole.  Fear mongering@every stop.  Nobody wants to destroy 2A, people want change and our kids to not get murdered.  Close loopholes, ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, fund mental health care.  #dosomethingnow
3007 2018-02-22 15:58:30 If she actually created that question instead of CNN giving it to her, did she need to keep reading it verbatim? and how did bump stocks get mentioned when it wasn't used by the perp?
3008 2018-02-22 15:58:26 Funny..while you support the ban on bump stocks- where is our 2A rights in this?? Hmmm seems like you are playing whatever side you to stay relevant...
3009 2018-02-22 15:58:23 Judging by the financial reports, it's the @NRA and gun manufacturers who don't mind a mass shooting, for each time one happens certain stocks go up.  Sad to see profit in death.
3010 2018-02-22 15:58:13 58 people died in Vegas because of assault weapons & bump stocks all should be Banned over 500 shot

Bump stocks are not guns............. 
3013 2018-02-22 15:57:56 Bumpfire stocks are AWFUL in practical usage. Using them ruins accuracy and it's exceptionally counter intuitive to how marksmen actually shoot. No military anywhere uses them, they are worthless from a combat perspective.
Less people died in Vegas BECAUSE he used them...
3014 2018-02-22 15:57:55 Buying stocks and crypto is just a bunch of 'what ifs' for me. Disappointing ones usually.
3015 2018-02-22 15:57:41 I support the first part but in the history of mass shootings bump stocks have till the total of 58 people in just one event
3016 2018-02-22 15:57:41 Snapchat’s stocks are plummeting all because Kylie Jenner tweeted that she doesn’t use the app anymore. Society is ridiculous
3017 2018-02-22 15:57:33 Problem is, if it's not done immediately after the shooting then nothing ever happens. Look at Las Vegas/Bump stocks. Republican's said they would work to ban them, then never did. Only bringing it up again now after another massacre where bump stock had no role.
3018 2018-02-22 15:57:29 Ban military grade assault rifles. Or raise age, ban bump stocks, magazine capacity. And super strict background checks .
3019 2018-02-22 15:57:19 Your mentioning meetings but no immediate action. I'll agenda it for you. 1 ban sale of bump stocks, all automatic weapons NOW as in today!
2 ban sale of all guns to under 21's NOW as in today.3 introduce in depth investigation into all buying guns from dealers and privately

Besides, banning AR15’s etc, bump stocks,magazines & having far stricter gun control laws would be far cheaper.
3027 2018-02-22 15:56:37 Arming teachers but not banning bump stocks or AR's. Hmmmm...wonder why? Could it be all the blood money? If you aren't going to enact policy to keep U.S. safe. Step aside!

3035 2018-02-22 15:55:26 @RosLehtinen I want a vote of NO on any infringements to the 2nd Amendment, regarding bump stocks.  If you can regulate an ubiquitous piece of plastic you can regulate the entire 2nd Amendment out of existence piecemeal.
3036 2018-02-22 15:55:22 I disagree! Bump stocks are a gimick Vegas shooter did not use them, 18 yes ild are mature enough! Do something about the roug FBI!
3037 2018-02-22 15:55:09 .@RepJoeCourtney tells @AlanChartock that the votes are there to ban bump stocks and get rid of the gun show loophole
3038 2018-02-22 15:54:57 And ban bump stocks or not, criminals will still make their own or get one illegally so that "ban" really isn't effective
3039 2018-02-22 15:54:53 happy birthday gorg girl! x   @em_stocks
3040 2018-02-22 15:54:52 Most hot startups are overvalued based on historical valuations and metrics so maybe having a mkt where the stocks are not allowed to go down could be the answer
3041 2018-02-22 15:54:47 Do we really need an organization like the #NRA to protect our second amendment rights? Are they even under attack? Are raising age limits, banning bump stocks (already illegal), negotiating magazine limits really infringing on our right to own? I don’t understand.
3042 2018-02-22 15:54:31 I promised this year to be kind to the low information Trump voters. I will keep, the promise. An executive order is not a law, but more importantly Trump hasn't done that either. Facts, Trump cut funding for background checks. Also Bump stocks are still being sold, check Google!
3043 2018-02-22 15:54:27 If you think you need a bump stock, what you really need is psychiatric help.  There is nothing in the 2nd amendment about bump stocks.  Are you part of a “well-regulated militia”?  Didn’t think so.
3044 2018-02-22 15:54:21 And given the world stocks, I'd probably have to agree, at least for the time being.
3045 2018-02-22 15:54:19 Yep.
Should've banned bump stocks after Vegas, but they must have Congressional assurances that no one will fuck with the NRA.
Well, Fuck the NRA.

An old saying applies,
"They done pissed in their own hats."
#Parkland
#wtf
#resist
3046 2018-02-22 15:54:02 Put bump stocks on the ATF list of devices that need to be registered. I believe they are a novelty and I would never own one. I don’t think they should be banned. #2ndAmendment #gunsdontkillpeople #SupportTheNRA #realpatriot
3047 2018-02-22 15:53:35 You don’t have a right to a bump stock. Federal law bans full automatic conversion even if the regulation allowing sale of bump stocks online is unclear (being fixed as we speak by DOJ). You’re guilty of a felony if you converted this @Annakhait. CC: @ATFHQ @FBI
3048 2018-02-22 15:53:12 At least Trump is FINALLY doing something. "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"-Trump That's a START
3049 2018-02-22 15:53:12 From your mouth... He should ban assault weapons, bump stocks, strengthen background checks, ban those w/mental+emotional issues, longer waiting periods.
3050 2018-02-22 15:53:03 I don't support a bumpstock ban because it can't be banned. 
Because it's a lump of plastic with a spring
Because I can make one out of a rubberband
Because they keep using "rate of fire" as a metric because they want to ban more than just bumpfire stocks.
3051 2018-02-22 15:52:59 ... so people with the guns we want to protect - hand guns, semi-automatic rifles, guns with bump stocks etc - have a harder time inflicting irreparable harm.
3052 2018-02-22 15:52:59 If the age is raised & bump stocks banned, you will be a #OneTermPresident
3053 2018-02-22 15:52:33 And there is the turn folks... he is heading right back to the wings of safety of the NRA! Says bump stocks gone, age limit to be increased.. and then right back to NRA being “great guys”. Nothing is going to change! #neveragain
3054 2018-02-22 15:52:27 Look bump stocks won’t stop anything. Look at Chicago!  It is Znot the gun. Train and arm teachers.  STOP THE NEON SIGN OF GUN FREE ZONES that invite it.
3055 2018-02-22 15:52:17 Where does it say bump stocks in the constitution really? They had muskets when the constitution was written
3056 2018-02-22 15:51:54 Bump stock ban is a token ban. Bump stocks aren't used by anyone truly familiar with firearms.
3057 2018-02-22 15:51:42 And bump stocks have anything to do with it? lol
3058 2018-02-22 15:51:33 The most that @mschlapp and other conservative hacks can muster about even steps like banning devices that modify a gun to make it a fully automatic weapon (e.g., bump stocks) is to say they are open to idea. Seriously, you can’t just say you support such a ban?!
3059 2018-02-22 15:51:23 Stocks don’t like rising inflation
3060 2018-02-22 15:51:10 We hear a lot of talk, but the kids from #Parkland want action.

What are you doing about AR-15s, bump stocks, improve background checks, limit private sales?

That is action. 

Donating the $21 million the #NRABloodMoney you took in 2016 to the victims.

#GunControlNow
3061 2018-02-22 15:51:08 The only thing the NRA is interested in is their bottom line...... MONEY. Nobody is talking about taking Americans guns away, only certain military type weapons out of the hands of kids and the mentally ill and bump stocks.
3062 2018-02-22 15:50:59 I can't believe what I am reading.  Surely, you are not trying to end the sale of bump stocks?  Do not cave to this pressure.  Ending the sale of bump stocks will be about as effective as a gun free zone.
3063 2018-02-22 15:50:54 Power through! $FIEC
3064 2018-02-22 15:50:26 I see you're kissing up after yesterdays Ban Bump stocks, raise the age limit and background checks. Speaking of checks how much did you get today?
3065 2018-02-22 15:50:04 I just joined this week!  They are about gun safety and the 2nd Amendment. They have supported a ban on bump stocks for years!  An AR is just a semiautomatic rifle there are many many different manufacturers of semiautomatic rifles. It’s also the most popular hunting platform!
3066 2018-02-22 15:50:03 Stock prices go up after each shooting. Bump stocks had huge jump in value. They literally make money after mass shooting occurs. NRA lying rhetoric sends all fearful stockpile owners out to buy more guns—thus more profits. 
It’s all about the money. 
#commonsensegunlaws
3067 2018-02-22 15:49:51 It infuriates me that every mass shooting, people fixate on the particular tool that was used. In Parkland, an AR-15. In Vegas it was bump stocks. It is absurd to focus on those tools, ignoring thousands of deaths every year to all kinds of guns. #NeverAgain
3068 2018-02-22 15:49:41 The value went up in the stocks
3069 2018-02-22 15:49:36 My only problem is why the National schools should be better funded If that is not discriminatory No wonder their is such a scramble for a few top notch schools that are well funded equipped with adequate number of teachers and facilities for boarding libraries and books stocks ?
3070 2018-02-22 15:49:32 No that NRA trick won't work if u are willing to help ,stop lying to these students and do what is best for them not NRA ,not age increases ,ban bump stocks, reinstate the ban on assault weapons & magazines stop playing games with people's lives, or People will speak n Nov
3071 2018-02-22 15:49:19 The @NRA will only give concessions on mental health and bump stocks, to keep the money flowing. They are not protectors of the 2nd Amendment, just a lobby for arms dealers. The GOP is bought and paid for.
3072 2018-02-22 15:49:07 So a 20-year-old mother cannot purchase a firearm to defend her family? One whack job uses bump stocks to commit a horrible crime and law abiding recreational shooters are punished? Think all of this through and don’t over react because it will never be enough for the Soc agenda
3073 2018-02-22 15:49:00 First thing I don't agree with Trump on. Bump stocks shouldn't be banned.
3074 2018-02-22 15:48:48 Markets are rebounding after yesterday's close.  Stocks are positive, with DOW up over 200 and MBS up 22bps.  Yields have come back under the 1st resistance level it closed above yesterday (good for rates).
3075 2018-02-22 15:48:47 End sale of bump stocks... WOW 6 month after Vegas massacre. Way to go.
I hope congress does MORE. MAGA
3076 2018-02-22 15:48:41 Stock $NSPR has just announced an exclusive agreement #pennyStocks #stocks #stockMarket #StockTrading #trader #News
3077 2018-02-22 15:48:40 And bump stocks in fact turn a gun into a hell of a killing machine. Guns can’t be shot that fast without one unless it’s a true assault rifle.
3078 2018-02-22 15:48:38 Ok, that's it.  I'm all in stocks from here on out.
3079 2018-02-22 15:48:18 14 day waiting period. No sales at gun shows. 10 round magazine limit. No bump stocks. Licenses for all arms. Assault rifle ban. Universal background check. Minimum age of purchase 21. Domestic violence ban. Funding to enforce the above.
3080 2018-02-22 15:48:09 Actually our fishing stocks aren't that bad in fact but after Brexit when we can kick out Europeans fishing our waters, they should recover quickly and get a lot better! However we must do something about plastics. That's appalling.
3081 2018-02-22 15:48:01 In a low return world generating a return in anything (including stocks) will be challenging. But a 3.7% real return from fine wine since 1900 is remarkable.  Fine wine tends to perform well late cycle too, so I would expect it to do well in next few years. @johnauthers @FTLex
3082 2018-02-22 15:47:51 All of these are reasonable. I was a life long GOP member who believed in the 2nd Amendment and smaller government. With that said, I do not believe the 2nd means you can own any type of gun or as many as you want. I support the Pres who said get rid of ARs and bump stocks.
3083 2018-02-22 15:47:44 @OnPointRadio Someone needs to investigate contributions to the trump campaign from the private FOR PROFIT prison industry.  I guarantee trump/sessions were bribed by them.  The day trump stole the election (with Putin's huge helping hand) private for profit prison stocks jumped!
3084 2018-02-22 15:47:37 My stocks are strong this morning. 
3085 2018-02-22 15:47:32 It's simple. Ban ALL semi-automatic rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Institute UNIVERSAL background checks. Reinforce school security to acknowledge the sad reality that there are too many guns and little protection for kids. Vote out ALL politicians who disagree.
3086 2018-02-22 15:47:20 as a gun owner of many guns I think bump stocks piercing bullets and AR15's is way to much for public access
3087 2018-02-22 15:47:12 You have no clue if you think bump stocks are a right.  There is zero reason for them and look back at what guns the 2nd amendment was written about.
3088 2018-02-22 15:47:04 does this include dividends for stocks and all the insurance and holding costs of the other assets ?
3089 2018-02-22 15:46:56 maybe-dump Q: has it been argued that a gun, _once fitted_ with a bump stock, becomes ATF-regulatable? like that you could kill demand for bump stocks rather than supply by outlawing their insertion rather than their manufacture/sale

3096 2018-02-22 15:46:07 For the first time since you became President, I am disappointed in you. You bought into the whole let's create more gun laws to prevent criminals from owning firearms. I get bump stocks, and shoring up back ground checks. But raising the age limit?
3097 2018-02-22 15:46:02 “I hope?” Use you executive privilege, Mr President just like you did to decimate clean water. If Obama was for bump stocks, you can be sure you’d be signing an order against them, pronto!
3098 2018-02-22 15:45:46 Dear Liberals,

Getting rid of bump stocks is not a victory, it is a supremely ineffective solution, and appeals to your ignorance about guns.
3099 2018-02-22 15:45:42 Honestly I feel like our side has been trying to compromise for years. Background checks. Told No. Wait lists. No. Ban Bump stocks. No. Ever compromise we try for nothing happens. More people die. I'm ready to vote to take it all now.
3100 2018-02-22 15:45:40 Anna, bump stocks aren't widely used or liked. They make a firearm less accurate and really do not have a practical application. Well, apart from spraying rounds into a large crowd in one of the worst mass shootings in US history.
3101 2018-02-22 15:45:39 Trump asks "Why do we need bump stocks?" I ask;Why US Gov @Bundy Trial dismissed case BEFORE TRUTH of Attempted MASS MURDER of 3000 GOT OUT?
3102 2018-02-22 15:45:29 You want to ban BUMP STOCKS! You don't even have your eyes on banning assault rifles. BUMP STOCKS!
3103 2018-02-22 15:45:20 Not true, we hate: bump stocks, inadequate background checks, large magazines, automatic and semi-automatic weapons, inadequate mental healthcare, gun shows where zero background checks are performed as guns are traded and sold out of the trunks of cars.
3104 2018-02-22 15:45:16 Anyone with stocks in guns better be sure to sell off before 2020 at the latest.  Cuz change is gonna happen with or without the @GOP.
By 2020 we have FOUR MILLION NEW voters, including today's teenagers
3105 2018-02-22 15:45:11 Made me sick to watch Wayne LaPierre’s speech....not one indication that lack of background checks, gun show sales, bump stocks, automatic weapons led to these horrific events. We do not need weapons, we need a change of attitude #whatIneedtoteach
3106 2018-02-22 15:45:08 agree but at some point there needs to be compromise - the vast majority of Americans see no need to sell AR's and bump stocks - can't we start there? Call it "gun oversight" or "gun reasonableness" if it makes people feel better. Blue lives DO matter.  So do adults & children
3107 2018-02-22 15:45:04 Anna....bump stocks are a firearm accessory....not the actual firearm. It increases the rate of fire.
3108 2018-02-22 15:44:58 yes same here, bought stocks for my money so need your card. thx buddy
3109 2018-02-22 15:44:56 @waynelapierrejr YOU ARE CRAZY!!  NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THE 2ND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF ANYONE by taking away Assault rifles and bump stocks.  NO REASON   EXCEPT TO ANNIALATE PEOPLE.  ALL YOU DO IS INFLAME THE BAD NOT THE GOOD IN PEOPLE
3110 2018-02-22 15:44:54 What’s your thoughts on him directing bump stocks to be banned?
3111 2018-02-22 15:44:47 $WBA and $CVS are doomed stocks now that $AMZN is definitely coming into their market.
3112 2018-02-22 15:44:46 Protect bump stocks? Patriotic? You’re the worst president ever!!!!
3113 2018-02-22 15:44:17 Which is why I think limiting magazine capacity to 6 to 10 rounds is the best solution I’ve heard. Bump stocks make it easier to fire faster but they’re easily manufactured so even banning them isn’t a real solution. Which is why this issue is so difficult to solve.
3114 2018-02-22 15:44:07 PZOO
3115 2018-02-22 15:43:35 Some people literally think owning any and all kinds of guns are their right. They try to argue that bump stocks don’t turn their guns into practically full auto, but they do.
3116 2018-02-22 15:43:35 I’m good with getting rid of bump stocks.....it’s an accessory for a firearm, not a firearm. No need for them.....although I’m curious how Obama’s ATF allowed them?
3117 2018-02-22 15:43:30 If this is true, then this pope is biggest hypocrite in the world. Billions in stocks and 40 foot walls around Vatican. And yet..preaches charity and diversity to us. Something is not right here.
3118 2018-02-22 15:43:28 I will destroy y’all in stocks as hard as Liam destroys the enemy team playing Annie jungle in league of legends
3119 2018-02-22 15:43:15 There is a reason why earning is missed! Brexit, shrinking economy and rise of fintech. Investors needs to understand there is no growth for LLOYDS. Money is better elsewhere for investors. No diff than investing in tobaccos stocks.
3120 2018-02-22 15:43:09 How to decide if a stock is investment stock? I am experimenting with magic formula plus dividend stocks, is it good enough?
3121 2018-02-22 15:43:07 Ban All assault weapons! Ban bump stocks. It’s a great start. The NRA might want their $30 million back.
3122 2018-02-22 15:43:00 Wayne and his crew @NRA, @realDonaldTrump line your pockets . Russia funneled millions through this fascist org to the GOP. They will only bend on mental health and bump stocks for their own monetary survival. You are gross and easy to read, little donnie.
3123 2018-02-22 15:42:56 That’s about as silly as your defense of bump stocks.
3124 2018-02-22 15:42:55 Not enough, feeble man.  More actual gun control.  Eliminate the ability to buy weapons of war.  Plus it isn't in your power to "ban" bump stocks because the ATF has jurisdiction over those, unless Congress changes that, so...massive FAIL.
3125 2018-02-22 15:42:54 @KerriMPR it took a school shooting to get to the point of banning(the sales?) of bump stocks -- BUMP STOCKS! But not after someone used the Bump stock to kill 50+ people in Vegas...because why?  The Gun lobby knows they just need to wait us out.
3126 2018-02-22 15:42:50 @JoeNBC @chucktodd Trump said he wants bump stocks banned, okay. Talk however is cheap & it is note worthy that congress must enact a law for this to happen. Nothing yet from congress so yet another sidestep from Trump.
3127 2018-02-22 15:42:43 I am fine with banning the mystical "assault" guns, whatever those are.  Scary looking stocks, I guess. But don't touch my semi-automatics.  Sooo stupid
3128 2018-02-22 15:42:39 #stocks For anyone from 18 to 50 an allocation of 65% in world stocks, 25% in world bonds, 5% in gold, and 5% in cash has tremendous structural stability and, therefore, is suitable for just about everyone.
3129 2018-02-22 15:42:36 My normal inclination is to shy away from gun control but it makes sense to eliminate bump stocks, enhance data mining so the dots (purchases, social media, police reports) are connected, and enhance mental health detection and treatment.
3130 2018-02-22 15:42:35 No it’s not!  Only assault/semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks. You can keep the pistols and the rifles/shotguns for hunting.
3131 2018-02-22 15:42:32 @RobinhoodApp will you be including Robinhood Feed for stocks as well?
3132 2018-02-22 15:42:29 I do not understand how raising the age to purchase guns will do anything to stop crime or make us safer. At best it will make us less safe. has some of the same issues. The concept is just feel good. Banning bump stocks will also not make us safer. Bans don't work and never have
3133 2018-02-22 15:42:27 Buy half today and half tomorrow to get a better deal. Stocks tend to fall 2 or 3 days in a rows on bad ER.
3134 2018-02-22 15:42:13 History repeats - there will be upsurge in gun purchases, gun co. profits rise, gun stocks go up, NRA membership expands, liberals lose on issue in elections
3135 2018-02-22 15:42:12 Bump stocks seems like such a no-brainer to ban! Now I know why the useless GOP hasn't yet! It is clear they held off to use as a bargaining chip should a mass shooting grip the nation! Step aside GOP if you don't plan to lead on gun reform!!
#StudentsStandUp #ThursdayThoughts
3136 2018-02-22 15:42:03 No its not. Even with bump stocks, it doesn't become one.
3137 2018-02-22 15:42:00 @SenBennetCO  What are you doing to prevent mass killings? #Parkland is just the latest example the current prevention methods are not working. Bump stocks are circumventing legislation. These types of devices need to be made illegal.
3138 2018-02-22 15:41:44 I’m 100% with you on banning the accessories, huge magazines, trigger kits, bump stocks, and enhanced backgrounds; I’ll add one more 21 to buy.
3139 2018-02-22 15:41:40 Bump stocks, a lot of people think this is minor. Without out these the gun are illegal to use.  Good start @realDonaldTrump
3140 2018-02-22 15:41:40 1. The symbolism of the National Guard is the Minuteman                           2. Then ban bump stocks.
3141 2018-02-22 15:41:34 What, we’ll give you bump stocks if you give us armed teachers? Fuck that noise. Give us bump stocks and then come to the table with a legitimate response to change current gun legislation.
3142 2018-02-22 15:41:25 I won't give an inch on my rights. Improve background check reporting? Great! Amend HIPAA to limit privacy on mental health? Doubt we will. & I don't give a rat's ass about bump stocks. But concessions to the Left never appease them, they merely shift the goalposts anew
3143 2018-02-22 15:41:25 I get the bump stocks.  Take them away, no biggie.  But who is going to be the one to determine if someone is mentally ill aka dangerous?  There are plenty of quirky people in this World, but doesn't mean they are mentally ill
3144 2018-02-22 15:41:23 @NRA #WayneLaPierre closed his evil speech @CPAC with a salesmen pitch. The bullshit that only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun. But more guns it only helps him and his stocks making them more money while you all die. #ParklandShooting
3145 2018-02-22 15:41:14 If someone is using "will" "pretty sure" when it comes to projecting the trend or prices in stocks then they are immatured.. Use "could" instead.. safe.
3146 2018-02-22 15:40:52 No one wants to “take guns away” from responsible gun owners. As it is, people could easily 3D print guns & make their own bump stocks from hardware store items. But regulations & tighter restrictions would at least curb SOME of the senseless bloodshed.
3147 2018-02-22 15:40:51 No! just get some cool money and get stocks and cash out every month. Use the time to work on something else. They don’t pay like their stocks! Lol
3148 2018-02-22 15:40:49 Mag capacity, age limits, bump stocks—this is all tiddlywinks. The NRA are sacrificing these as trade because they’re nervous. Press on. Keep with it. Get assault weapons banned nationwide. It can be done.
3149 2018-02-22 15:40:44 What is he is not insane, i.e., passes the background check, at the time he legally buys a military style assault weapon and a bump stock, but becomes mentally ill AFTER the purchase? AR-15s & bump stocks should not be sold to non-military citizens, PERIOD!
3150 2018-02-22 15:40:41 @KarinHousley @KathyLohmer As a constituent I would like to understand your position on background checks for gun ownership, ownership of assault weapons, bump stocks, and silencers
3151 2018-02-22 15:40:33 Trump said he was going to ban bump stocks when they sold out after Vegas. Two mass shootings later, he's still saying that. Meanwhile, the best commercial for bump stocks turned out to be a bloody mass shooting. Quite a society you have over there...
3152 2018-02-22 15:40:28 *deep breath, maybe one big breath of a thousand tiny breaths*
INSTEAD OF ARMING TEACHERS, BAN SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS AND ASSAULT RIFLES!
3153 2018-02-22 15:40:20 Banning "rate increasing devices" like bump stocks is a slippery slope to banning all semi-automatic firearms.
3154 2018-02-22 15:40:09 Great Job and good idea on the butt stocks.
3155 2018-02-22 15:39:45 Now that Pres. Trump has listened, he must act. Push Congress to pass stronger background checks and bans on high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. No more fatal fealty to NRA.
3156 2018-02-22 15:39:40 I'm quite pro-gun myself but bump stocks are just a range toy. Banning them may not be especially helpful but losing them isn't really worth getting upset about.
3157 2018-02-22 15:39:40 Bump stocks increases the rate of fire, correct? How does that not pertain to the scenario? In a crowded school hallway, would bump stocks (along with high capacity magazines) help the shooter kill more people?
3158 2018-02-22 15:39:26 You do know it's possible to bump fire almost any semiautomatic without a bump stock, right? That's the point of this tweet, not the only the bump stocks themselves...
3159 2018-02-22 15:39:14 Bump stocks have probably only been used in one crime in this country's history but go ahead and waste your time Banning it because it literally makes no difference. People will make their own bump stocks if they want to commit a crime.
3160 2018-02-22 15:39:11 If @realDonaldTrump wants to really listen, he’d drain the swamp of big money in Congress! Get rid of the @NRA in government! Get rid of bump stocks, get rid of AR-15, get rid off assault rifles! Don’t give teachers guns, give them more pay!
3161 2018-02-22 15:39:05 It's a smart move, instead of paying loans they will be buying stocks :)
3162 2018-02-22 15:38:52 just had a quick read through the constitution.... can't see anything about bump stocks being there.... can you print to the part that says you're entitled to them
3163 2018-02-22 15:38:44 The left won't stop with just bump stocks or age to purchase. Remember most gun laws in the south were created to disenfranchise blacks. My beloved Reagan banned open carry in Cali because of the Black Panthers marching armed, to stop police abuses.
3164 2018-02-22 15:38:41 It's not just AR15. Theirs no such thing as a assault rifles. All a AR15 is a regular rifle with goodies on it to make it look like a military rifle. Their goal. Is to ban all rifles with a collapsible  stocks. Modified barrels that hold the scopes on and flashlights Etc.
3165 2018-02-22 15:38:36 Another flip flop from Trump...if folks haven’t noticed yet,he just says whatever he thinks his base will enjoy. And when he talks about banning bump stocks,no way the GOP and NRA go for that.
3166 2018-02-22 15:38:36 "God first"... "Animal lover".... "Bump stocks are my right, lay off my guns" ... You are a living contradiction. Screw everyone else, I want a killing machine I can fire even faster.
3167 2018-02-22 15:38:33 Want to ban bump stocks then you better ban shoe strings and any other string as well because I can bump fire with a string too.
3168 2018-02-22 15:38:31 U.S. Stocks Rise, Pare Week’s Losses
3169 2018-02-22 15:38:27 I'm fine with the 21 year old requirement. Bump stocks and giving the government control over who to deem 'mentally stable' give me pause.
3170 2018-02-22 15:38:09 @POTUS PLEASE DON'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR LEFTIST BY DOING AWAY WITH BUMP STOCKS.
3171 2018-02-22 15:38:07 Lets give teachers Ar15's. Walk the corridors with them. Maybe with bump stocks too. Dont want our teachers outgunned! Ugh . How bout we remove security detail from politicians and put them in the schools?
3172 2018-02-22 15:38:03 High with blacks, Latinos, immigrants, his approval rating is as high as Obama's at this time, they are fooling you, they are manipulating you. And now he's going to ban bump stocks and is talking about lifting the gun purchase age to 21 and watch it will be nothing but negative!
3173 2018-02-22 15:37:53 @RealDonaldTrump. Your idea to arm teachers is stupid. Teachers need to be focused on teaching, not on being armed security guards.  We don't need shootouts in schools.  We need to #banmilitaryassaultweapons, ban high capacity clips, ban bump stocks and ban easy access to guns.
3174 2018-02-22 15:37:49 Bump stocks don't kill people.  People did. Besides there are multiple videos from Vegas saying it was machine gun fire.  This is a Democrat gun grab to make us defenceless. #2ndAmendment
3175 2018-02-22 15:37:45 Bump stocks turn the fire rate of many guns into near machine gun levels. There is no reason why anyone needs access to them.
3176 2018-02-22 15:37:41 Plus, I am not against gun rights,either. I’m against guns that never should be in the hands of civilians. Ever. And I am for very strict background checks, a waiting period, banning bump stocks and larger magazines. I’m against weapons designed for mass casualties on the streets
3177 2018-02-22 15:37:28 The part that says “shall not be infringed” pretty much covers bump stocks and everything related.
3178 2018-02-22 15:37:20 "Habang kumukuha ako ng stocks,bigla na lang tumulo ang luha ko. Naisip ko bigla na magkulong na lang sa Walk-in Freezer"
3179 2018-02-22 15:37:20 Come on man bump stocks really smh
3180 2018-02-22 15:37:12 Le pétrole remonte un peu, le marché hésite avant les stocks américains
3181 2018-02-22 15:37:08 Bumper stocks were already decided by ATF that it doesn't  meet the standards of automatic weapons.  Semi auto shotguns with buckshot are more dangerous
3182 2018-02-22 15:37:00 PROTECT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS
IMPOSE STRICTER GUN LAWS
MAKE IN IMPOSSIBLE FOR MENTALLY ILL, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, AND CRIMINALS TO OBTAIN WEAPONS
IMPLEMENT MORE COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS
RAISE THE AGE TO 21
BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS
AND END SALE OF BUMP STOCKS
3183 2018-02-22 15:36:47 Semi automatic. And bump stocks make no difference because anyone can pull the trigger just as quick. Nigga anyone could buy a .22 rifle and do just as much damage. So what is the solution
3184 2018-02-22 15:36:29 How about this:  Responsible gun owners lead the effort to remove assault weapons, bump stocks, mental status, age of responsibility with the NRA and our laws.  Responsible people act responsibly.
3185 2018-02-22 15:36:17 Mr. President. You're giving in to liberal nonsense. We didn't elect you to modify our gun laws but to PRESERVE them. Leave Bump Stocks Alone. Our Gun Rights are to protect us from the Government Swamp creatures who want to de-arm us. NEVER. NEVER. NEVER!!!
3186 2018-02-22 15:36:15 Are you freaking kidding, you have no idea. The president knows that. He has said it. Where have you been in the closet. Bump stocks are not going to do anything so by passing the laws and raising the age is only appeasing the Democrats, do you get it yet.
3187 2018-02-22 15:36:04 He must have invested billions in bump stocks
3188 2018-02-22 15:36:04 I don't understand why this is so hard!  I didn't become a teacher to carry a gun. A school is supposed to be a safe zone! We don't want to ban guns (that'll never happen in U.S.), just bump stocks and AR-15s!
3189 2018-02-22 15:35:49 well like the world of stocks and mineral investing. They all move together which means MANIPULATION.  People have to start taking action against the greed of the World!  All boils down to banksters!  Bashing for the last several weeks!   They scare people, they buy low.
3190 2018-02-22 15:35:43 Also, I hear bump stocks are mostly a novelty item that NO ONE had really heard of before Vegas?
3191 2018-02-22 15:35:31 Sick delusions. You're just outrageous. SMDH!
Ban Assault  Weapons, Ammo, Bump Stocks!
3192 2018-02-22 15:35:23  Tomorrow morning is "Fruity Friday" at London Bridge from 08:15 and "Free fruit for your commute" day at Ebbsfleet from 07:30. Whilst stocks last. Grab yourself a healthy start to the day 
3193 2018-02-22 15:35:19 They are baffoons. Credit where credit is due. That was a good thing the president did. His memo about bump stocks is good too but I'm cautiously skeptical  since Congress has to act for it actually take effect.
3194 2018-02-22 15:35:15 Automatic weapons are already illegal, bump stocks will prevent semi-autos from mimicking automatic action.  Semi-auto comprise the majority of what hunters and self-defense enthusiasts use.  AR15s may appear militaristic in looks but they are nothing more than a high powered 22.
3195 2018-02-22 15:35:10 Thanks for the info! I agree. Stock performance makes no sense. It’s one of the only oil stocks to be at a 52 week low as oil has continued higher.
3196 2018-02-22 15:35:10 I’m not. If you’re old enough to carry a gun into battle for our nation, you shouldn’t be stripped of that right when you’re back home even if you haven’t served. I have no problem getting rid of bumps stocks, though.
3197 2018-02-22 15:35:00 Latest Storage Withdrawal = 124Bcf.  Stocks were 609Bcf less than last year at this time and 412Bcf below the 5-year average of 2,172Bcf.  At 1,760Bcf, total working gas is  within the five-year historical range.
3198 2018-02-22 15:34:52 Me President,
If we can send an 18 year old to go fight and die for this country. How is it fair to tell them they can’t buy a gun. I agree with better background checks and even bump stocks. But I don’t see how raising the age to 21. Thank you.
3199 2018-02-22 15:34:51 I Comprehensive Background Checks Mental Health. Raise Bump Stocks! Congress - I!
3200 2018-02-22 15:34:45 The second amendment never mentions bump stocks !(or AR15s) so why do you consider it a"right". I'm not allowed to own a s400 missile and the 2nd amendment doesn't mention that either ! What is wrong with sensible gun control? No one is talking about taking your guns away !
3201 2018-02-22 15:34:41 Ok Tilly, I'll give up bump stocks, in return for your support of the National Concealed Carry Reciprocity??
How about it?
Give and take?
Or are you the type that just wants what you want and nothing for the other side??
3202 2018-02-22 15:34:35 NRA chief doesn’t admit there is no constitutional right to bump stocks! #BS
3203 2018-02-22 15:34:27 DONT BAN BUMP STOCKS
3204 2018-02-22 15:34:24 Still hear same ol Fed "saying" exactly what asset markets want to hear, green-lighting continuation of destructive tendencies! Nothing I've heard says Powell any more for "ordinary Americans" as Bernanke/Yellen! Stocks hear same, IMO.

Only hope is that bond market listening!

3209 2018-02-22 15:34:00 How much money did he invest in bump stocks to be scurrying so
3210 2018-02-22 15:33:56 For the sake of the mining stocks, I hope you’re wrong.
3211 2018-02-22 15:33:56 A lot of folks will be up in arms over bump stocks for no good reason. A proficient person could go into an un-armed crowd w/ an old 10 shot bolt action Enfield,  do tons or a quick finger on a Tavor. I hate giving in on meaningless things but bump stocks don't mean a lot to me.
3212 2018-02-22 15:33:47 It's time for Illinois to ban bump stocks. These accessories are useless for self-defense or hunting, but very useful for causing massive destruction in a short amount of time. #StudentsStandUp
3213 2018-02-22 15:33:32 ANTI-GUN JUDAS !!! Vote Republican they said, drain the swamp they said. YOU BETRAYED US, AND OUR BUMP STOCKS !!! You just lost my vote for 2020 !!!  YOU WANT TO BAN MY PROPERTY AND ATTACK MY RIGHTS !!!!! Please repent !
3214 2018-02-22 15:33:23 Actually, I am asking why she wants a bump stock. She replied with “because it’s my right”. I am then asking if we should do things just because they are our right. I think most of you are saying no. Denise, do you want bump stocks legal?
3215 2018-02-22 15:32:52 He's also doing more than removing bump stocks. He's raising the age limit to own a gun. Also, if a teacher were to attack children. That's what the other teachers would be for. You act like they'd all simultaneously go on a murder spree.
3216 2018-02-22 15:32:49 No Military Style Weapons On Our Streets, Ban Bumb Stocks, Raise The Age To 21, We Are Roaring Very Load, Get Smart PPL these Young Kids Are Smarter Than PPL Of The House And Senate, Let's Vote Them Out In 2018 And Special Elections
3217 2018-02-22 15:32:48 The Constitution doesn't mention bump stocks. Bump stocks aren't "arms" they're an accessory.

3222 2018-02-22 15:32:33 Very misleading headline. In the attached article it covers the @realDonaldTrump just asked for comprehensive background checks, raising minimum age for gun buyers, and banning bump stocks.  He also said @NRA  are great patriots and will do the right thing. Do better @SFGate
3223 2018-02-22 15:32:20 Corruption getting free moneyyyy! What's new in crypto lol.

Wtf sense does that even make they hand out stocks like candy not crypto, and why would you need to send him money first like a Nigerian prince? Lol
3224 2018-02-22 15:32:14 Doing something about the issue is arming the schools not banning junk stocks that do not work well.

3226 2018-02-22 15:32:09 @marcorubio u say u r moving next week to put things like bump stocks ban into law, why did it take more ppl dying & kids face to face to move this into law? Why can’t congress keep doing productive work w/out a crisis? Kids should be at school not trying to fix congress
3227 2018-02-22 15:32:05 Show where it says owning bump stocks are a right. You don't need it.
3228 2018-02-22 15:32:04 Actually Krissy, you sound like an idiot.    Maybe the people who are not gun experts don’t know the correct terminology, but AR15, Bump stocks, and large capacity clips seems to be common items found in mass shootings.
3229 2018-02-22 15:32:04 Also silencers, flash hiders, grips, stocks, etc that make it easier to conceal shots or get off dozens of rounds in quick succession accurately.
3230 2018-02-22 15:31:58 Bump Stocks for #StableGenius. I though they were support briefs for #FatNixon.
3231 2018-02-22 15:31:49 ... Mental health issues are one facet of the problem and a point many keep bringing to his attention, bump stocks are what everyone demanded be felt with after Vegas, Now he is being punished for meeting those demands... Seems silly
3232 2018-02-22 15:31:41 All of these points are just bargaining chips.  They'll offer the bump stocks, background checks, and mental health checks.  then they'll have their demands and hope that the bump stock sacrifice will be worth everything they get in return. Just like trading DACA for the Wall.
3233 2018-02-22 15:31:36 He’s against short sales of Trump stocks.
3234 2018-02-22 15:31:32 Banning bump stocks is like banning gun sights...its the gun that shoots the bullets
3235 2018-02-22 15:31:28 Teachers are already highly trained. IN TEACHING. Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks and other accessories that make a weapon fully automatic. Ban large magazines.
3236 2018-02-22 15:31:17 I got an email last night about how it's irresponsible of me to be bullish stocks "at these levels". I'm told it is my duty being in the public eye to protect "Joe Retail". I was advised to look in the mirror and be ashamed. How do I even respond to that?
3237 2018-02-22 15:31:01 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Droid Checks with an emphasis on Droid Health. Raise blaster age to 21 and end sale of Blaster Stocks! ImpSen is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
3238 2018-02-22 15:30:59 @realDonaldTrump 98% of public mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. That's the real problem... banning bump stocks or expanding background checks won't fix that. Don't get sucked into the liberal mania.
3239 2018-02-22 15:30:55 Bump stocks will get banned and the back ground check part will be done by rule imo
3240 2018-02-22 15:30:24 I was going to vote for you but I'm not going to if you pass any gun control. This includes any restrictions on bump stocks or raising the age of when you can access a right. Do you know you can serve in the military 18 why can you trust them with an M16 but not an AR-15
3241 2018-02-22 15:30:23 4) ban bump stocks & high capacity magazines. 5) implement stop and frisk with controls so that police cannot abuse or misuse this capability. 6) close background check loopholes and implement for all gun transactions including gun shows and person to person sales, 7) -

3249 2018-02-22 15:30:02 Note: seriously, if you want to see an exploiter game the system, guns are right up there with video games. They lend themselves to backyard tinkering. 'Bump stocks' were one of those things that I hoped nobody outside a small group ever learned of.

3251 2018-02-22 15:29:47 Well if I'm not mistaken, semi auto's can be converted to fully automatic capability with the modification of certain parts, or the addition of others....ie: bump stocks, or what CA just banned, the button thingy. Right??   Sorry I don't remember the tech term. 
3252 2018-02-22 15:29:46 Uh...automatic weapons and modifiers like bump stocks weren't even around when the Second Amendment was adopted. Probably not even considered a possibility. It's time to rethink what's an appropriate arm to bear, and what should be kept out of the hands of private citizens.
3253 2018-02-22 15:29:33 #stocks#StockMarket   I strongly advise no matter your age you have a Treasury bond ladder in addition to any stock market investment strategy you're implementing. Dull blue chips are not just for rich Republican fuddy duddies. These free cash flowing cows give rich cream to all.

3256 2018-02-22 15:29:21 This is why I've put all my retirement savings into replicator stocks.
3257 2018-02-22 15:29:19 None. This is a lagged reaction to the Vegas shooting because nothing got done about bump stocks last time.
3258 2018-02-22 15:29:03 Im a gun advocated and I'm not even hearing arguments about bump stocks. They're nothing but an unnecessary added point of failure on a weapon.
3259 2018-02-22 15:28:47 Shut up. You do not believe in "being responsible", that would mean admitting that there is no use for bump stocks, no use for assault weapons, & a need for full background checks.
You don't get to claim to be responsible while being totally irresponsible.
Shut up.
3260 2018-02-22 15:28:46 I'll give you:
* Raise age own AR15 to 21
* Bump stocks illeagle
* Improved background check

* Improved mental health (for all ages)

You give me:
* Abortions illeagle

* No more gun free zones at schools

3265 2018-02-22 15:28:02 Come on, are you an adult at 18 or 21? Bump stocks are no different then your belt loop, gonna ban belt loops also?
3266 2018-02-22 15:28:00 To be clear, I was a lifetime member of the NRA. I will not be as of tonight. We need to ban the accessory’s of “ArmaLite Rifles”. The high capacity mag, banned for hunting in most states, the trigger kits, “illegal if installed”, bump stocks, & bg checks 4 private sales.
3267 2018-02-22 15:27:46 If this remotely comes close to .37 I’m fkin out I’ll sell 500k shares and get the fk out this is ridiculous..other stocks maintain while fat goes down the shitter
3268 2018-02-22 15:27:44 No one wants to remove all guns. Just Ak15 Military and Bump Stocks from Civilians.

3269 2018-02-22 15:27:44 Your common sense reasoning makes sense but back ground checks will not catch them all no bump stocks no large magazines and save the fear  speech about loosing all our guns @waynelapierrejr
3270 2018-02-22 15:27:39 Bump stocks are unwelcome intruders in the firearms industry. The NRA and the firearms manufacturers that control congress through the NRA will probably accept the banning of bump stocks as an acceptable sacrifice in order to keep selling weapons of war to gun nuts.
3271 2018-02-22 15:27:33 preserve the 2nd amendment. keep our guns. Keep bump-stocks legal. don’t tread on me.
3272 2018-02-22 15:27:32 Ban bump stocks, trigger cranks, large-capacity magazines, & then restrict AR-15s the way we restricted machine guns. Improve NICS, fund mental health, ban gun ownership by the mentally ill. Stop touting the deterrent effect of armed teachers - most mass shooters are suicidal.
3273 2018-02-22 15:27:29 Dans la limite des stocks disponibles...
3274 2018-02-22 15:27:06 As much as I dislike Trump, he has moved to regulate bump stocks and has signaled that they will look to have more extensive background checks on these guns. Both are good moves, we'll see where is goes from there, but both parties suck.

3276 2018-02-22 15:26:53 Normally, important support levels are not broken easily; it usually takes a couple of attempts. If the 10-year rallies significantly through the 3.04%, it could pressure stocks and cause a test or undercut of the recent low. Right now, all eyes are on inflation and yields.
3277 2018-02-22 15:26:49 Agreed, it took balls. If it makes you feel any better I don’t hear anyone in real life (besides dramatic memes and propaganda-style articles) saying they want a full ban. I do think we should ban things like bump stocks. Those are a scary loophole for making automatics.

3280 2018-02-22 15:26:28 Hey bot, the second amendment was put in place to protect the colonists from home invasions by British soldiers during Revolutionary times. It had nothing to do with bump stocks or automatic rifles.
3281 2018-02-22 15:26:24 So the answer is because you fear if bump stocks are banned that will be the start of you losing all your guns?
3282 2018-02-22 15:26:14 @waynelapierrejr trying to convince America they’re behind background checks, support mental health care...and won’t talking assault weapons, bump stocks, ghost guns, loopholes in private sales and gun shows. #comingfortheNRA.

3286 2018-02-22 15:25:59 I agree with you and that was part of the problem. But this is the trap we fall in to after every incident - there is always one loophole that can be nitpicked by the NRA and gun advocates to try and shift the blame - bump stocks, magazine size, a point of entry -
3287 2018-02-22 15:25:57 What are you doing? Why bump stocks? Look at FBI stats, less die from rifles than hand2hand combat or knives or cars. I love to MAGA but Americans need more guns not less.
3288 2018-02-22 15:25:55 Well if I'm not mistaken, semi auto's can be converted to fully automatic capability with the modification of certain parts, or the addition of others....ie: bump stocks, or what CA just banned, the button thingy. Right??   Sorry I don't remember the tech term. 
3289 2018-02-22 15:25:47 Please include the topics you mentioned in your earlier tweet as well.

3290 2018-02-22 15:25:45 I am in California. On the list. I can’t wait! I am going to buy both traditional stocks and cryptocurrency using Robinhood @RobinhoodApp
3291 2018-02-22 15:25:44 Yea. There are a few obvious measures.  Get rid of AR15s, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. Mandatory reporting of large ammunition purchases. Not that goddamn hard
3292 2018-02-22 15:25:30 Fact is AR type guns are NOT necessary for hunting or protection. They are weapons of war and should be used only by TRAINED military personnel! 
"well regulated militia" 
Ban bump stocks and magazines that hold more than 6-10 rounds. License and insure every gun!
3293 2018-02-22 15:25:23 2 things. Ban bump stocks. They’re stupid and no serious shooter I know uses them. 2. The right to keep and bare arms is actually in the text of our constitution. Abortion is nowhere to be found. Ya know what can be found? Right to LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
3294 2018-02-22 15:25:23 GUN PEOPLE: Whoa, let’s not overreact here. Can’t let a few dead children every so often limit our sacred Liberty and Freedom

ALSO GUN PEOPLE: DID YOU HEAR THEY‘RE CONSIDERING A BAN ON BUMP STOCKS?! EVERYBODY BUY BUMP STOCKS NOW GO GO GO AHHHHHHH
3295 2018-02-22 15:25:00 You will not agree.Trump actually cares. I think the exec order banning bump stocks was 1st action. More vetting gun purchase will be next.
3296 2018-02-22 15:24:56 Mr President,  Not Supportive of this!  I seriously don’t think gun shops need to be involved with mental health in ANY capacity. Nor, do our Responsible Midwest hunters need to wait til age 21!! And bump stocks will always be rigged by criminals, They don’t care about laws!!
3297 2018-02-22 15:24:55 Trump is a puppet for the NRA, and the NRA is clever. They’ll back down on bump stocks, raising age to 21, slightly more stringent backgrounds checks. In return, they (GOP and NRA) can claim they did something, met demands, problem solved. I call BS. It’s not enough. #NeverAgain

3300 2018-02-22 15:24:32 Why does the SWAMP never offer up a single simple one page bill and vote on it, like illegal for bump stocks, or expanded background checks, or ban AR15. Is it because they don't want to be on record. Why does everything have to be 500 pages of everyone pet project??? 
SHAMEFUL
3301 2018-02-22 15:24:32 Harder for for people to get guns.  They’ve fought background checks, banning bump stocks. Congress even shut down a bill that would ban people on the no fly list or suspected terrorist from buying weapons because they’re in the pockets of the nra.
3302 2018-02-22 15:24:27 Las Vegas police prelim report in Jan: "He bought more than 55 firearms in less than a year, mostly rifles. He also bought more than 100 firearm-related items such as scopes, ammunition and bump stocks in the year before the attack."  *It's not just schools.*  It's ALL of us.
3303 2018-02-22 15:24:20 Lmao.. as they are now speaking from the cpac convention.. hum.. do away with semi and automatic weapons, bump stocks, silencer, large magazine, ghost guns, concealed carry, and loopholes.. maybe then we can protect americans better.
3304 2018-02-22 15:23:48 You are too smart to blindly follow the "more gun laws" brigade. That might work fine if you were not talking about a country already awash with more guns than people. Ban bump stocks? Yes. Better background checks? Yes. But I would suggest decent security at schools might help?
3305 2018-02-22 15:23:36 Stocks already trade at a relatively high level compared to expected earnings. The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio for the next 12 months was at more than 17 this week, down a bit after recent market volatility, but well above the 10-year average of 14.3.
3306 2018-02-22 15:23:35 Having gun rights slowly taken away is not the answer. Bump stocks have never done anyone damage. It takes a crazy human to cause the problem. When our military goes out to protect USA and at age 18 is expected to shoot straight...Never trusted to own a gun ?? R U Kidding ??
3307 2018-02-22 15:23:32 Did your big money donors at the NRA tell you to say this?   We need to ban AR-15 & other assualt rifles.  We need to ban bump stocks, change the age to 21 to buy any gun.  We need better mental health screenings & checks to buy a gun. Stop being a jerk @realDonaldTrump
3308 2018-02-22 15:23:30 Ferro's guests seemed unfamiliar with satellite stocks, incl $I, or that these are launched even by India, & cheaply, or that reusable rockets are not cost competitive, or that $TSLA loses money, as does #SpaceX, despite freeloading off #NASA staff & tech.

3309 2018-02-22 15:23:28 NRA speaking at CPAC.  Says media & Democrats pushing to kill the 2nd Amendment & take away our guns.  Outright lies.  Common sense regulations wanted!  Kill AR-15s & bump stocks, background checks shared, increase age to 21. NRA=BIG $’s.  NRA say all that disagree R Socialist!
3310 2018-02-22 15:23:04 Where is bump stock in the constitution? The question was about bump stocks not guns.
3311 2018-02-22 15:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Technology companies help drive US stocks broadly higher
3312 2018-02-22 15:23:01 Nope.  They're politicians.  They are slaves to their agenda.  If they wanted what was right, they would have had the sense to demand a ban on bump stocks, thorough background checks for ALL sales, including private sales, and do less industry lobbying and more safety lobbying...
3313 2018-02-22 15:22:51 What YOU fail to understand that what you just said is a pile of horse shit.  Getting rid of bump stocks is a positive move...just barely!  Countries with more guns have more shootings THAT is a hard fact, provable over and over again.  The NRA, like you, is the enemy.
3314 2018-02-22 15:22:25 Bump stocks are not your right! Fool
3315 2018-02-22 15:22:23 Listening to Wayne @nra right now. He doesn’t seem too inclined to do the right thing. Please follow through on your statements about background checks, bump stocks, minimum ages. Remember it’s what the American people overwhelmingly want, even if the NRA doesn’t.
3316 2018-02-22 15:22:17 I'm not for banning semi-automatic weapons ( Although I feel they should ban Assault weapons. ) Gun ownership should be more like droving with harder tests, requirements for proper storage, no loopholes like bump stocks, etc.

3318 2018-02-22 15:21:59 It's my right to live life w/out fear at school, at home, and in the streets. You aren't going to win a gun fight against our armed forces. Bump stocks aren't for anything other than a stupid hobby. If my golf hobby was killing kids at school, I'd have the decency to let it go.
3319 2018-02-22 15:21:44 Bend or break its not one or the other, common sense says move to the middle.ban bump stocks, large magazines strenthen back ground checks have trained people at schools with guns, work together as a team , calling each other names and doing nothing wont help,
3320 2018-02-22 15:21:42 Worth noting:  The House Democrats have had a bill for banning bump stocks ready to go for some time. But Ryan won't let it move forward.

3333 2018-02-22 15:20:22 The more mass shootings, the more panic of gun bans, the more the stocks go up. Feb 14 SWHC was $10.17/share, Feb 16 $10.91. That's a 7% return in 2 days. If someone had $100,000 invested, they made $7,000 from shooting
The NRA loves shootings

3343 2018-02-22 15:18:43 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mr. President, we already have a comprehensive background check in place. Bump stocks don't need banning because they're bloody useless and degrade accuracy. Do not make concessions to the Left! It will make no one safer and will embolden them even more!

3347 2018-02-22 15:18:19 NRA we are asking for  gun ownership responsibility background checks age increase for 18 to 21 extended background checks for a bump stocks or any assault rifle if you are a responsible gun owner these actions will not affect you or the second amendment but it will your sales

3352 2018-02-22 15:17:12 I fully support @realDonaldTrump proposal on changing age limit to 21, banning bump Stocks, and further background checks. Ill even support a law that says to sell a firearm you must go to a gun store the buyer must do a background check and if a seller refuses to do that
3353 2018-02-22 15:17:05 I just read that the sale of bump stocks just went up too because people are afraid of them being banned. I didn’t even know what one was before this. I used to live in a REALLY dangerous neighborhood in NYC(East Village) in the 80’s & have never even touched a gun.

3358 2018-02-22 15:16:52 Good for you for showing up. Now please take action. Trump’s plan to arm teachers is stupid. We need struck background checks. Ban on bump stocks, age restrictions, red flag laws, ban on semi-automatic.

3362 2018-02-22 15:15:55 Obama had 8 years to garner support for new gun laws. His only accomplishment was to pass a new bump stock regulation that allowed bump stocks to once again be sold.
3363 2018-02-22 15:15:39 Bump stocks have never been a constitutional right, ever.
3364 2018-02-22 15:15:27 I have to agree with Anna on gun rights.  I disagree with her opinion on bump stocks because it doesn't infringe on rights.  Also, banning certain firearms and making it more difficult to buy firearms than a used car would be great.
3365 2018-02-22 15:15:16 I was an NRA member. I don't hate the NRA, I hate that u r twisting my view. I am a patriot. I support the 2nd Amend. I just don't believe weapons of war r a part of that. BTW: quit NRA after LV when NRA was unreasonable about bump-stocks. U won't get another penny from us.
3366 2018-02-22 15:15:15 I must have missed the * in the #2a about bump stocks.
3367 2018-02-22 15:15:15 It is an empty gesture unless you take #action. The #VegasShooting took place months ago and no move has been made to ban bump stocks.
3368 2018-02-22 15:15:12 Oh, I assumed it wouldn't be on Twitter. I thought you were talking IRL.
I have heard that 70% of gun owners favor background checks & I'm sure asking them about semi-auto & bump stocks would receive the same answer. I'm a gun owner, I think all owners should take a class first.
3369 2018-02-22 15:15:11 scoreboards may be green, but plenty of stocks making lower lows.  bulls should use tight stops or buy protection
3370 2018-02-22 15:15:03 I believe in gun control of bump stocks.  What I can't possibly grasp is why some feel that placing laws on owning guns will even a little bit help control the criminals. Please someone tell me the rationalization of that.  I see gun control works in Chicago. NOT. Arm America!
3371 2018-02-22 15:15:00 Wayne LaPierre's solution: more armed security @ schools. ISN'T just school issue: Nevada shooter killed 58 from hotel 22nd floor. 47 guns found in his room-high-powered rifles capable of piercing police armor and bump stocks. U going to put armed security in hotel rooms too?
3372 2018-02-22 15:14:59 I’d like to think we could fix the laws and limit how many guns people can have, as well as what kinds and what accessories, like bump stocks and silencers. No civilian needs an assault rifle, or grenades. Military weapons should only be in the hands of active duty military.

3376 2018-02-22 15:14:14 Not entirely true. The NRA twice recommended to the previous admin not to approve bump stocks but obama admin did it anyway. NRA has been passionate about them being illegal but falls on deaf ears.
3377 2018-02-22 15:14:12 I agree with @POTUS about arming selected, trained teachers. Disagree about raising the voting age for purchase and banning bump stocks. Meaningless bone thrown to leftist fanatics. The priority is to protect the schools. Do what will WORK!

3384 2018-02-22 15:13:14 Did you hear the disgusting speech by the Chief of the NRA.  He said we want to eliminate the 2nd Amendment. All we want is for the NRA stoping the sale of bump stocks and semi automatic weapons.  They are ok with children being killed.hey defect. They have bloood on their hands
3385 2018-02-22 15:13:10 NRA president ranting about “gun rights” NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT ZERO GUNS- we’re talking about regulating “bump stocks”, AR15, AR 47 (weapons of war)
and demanding background checks on every gun purchaser. Mentally healthy citizens may own a gun for hunting, self defense 
3386 2018-02-22 15:13:07 Where in the constitution does it cover bump stocks, sounds interesting
3387 2018-02-22 15:12:51 Bump stocks are a way around a law. They need to be banned. It is a great start that all sides should agree on.
3388 2018-02-22 15:12:31 Bump stocks can go. Shouldn't be able to make a semi auto into an automatic and bypass all the regulations. I won't mind waiting an hour or a day or 2 to buy a new gun. Handguns are 21 to buy anyway so why not rifles and shot guns?
3389 2018-02-22 15:12:25 Bump stocks are not protected by the Second Amendment. I’m sorry you’re so badly misinformed.
3390 2018-02-22 15:12:04 Hi 2A’er here. Bump stocks aren’t a “right”.
3391 2018-02-22 15:11:53 Because someone questions the the need or wisdom of having assault weapons with 50 or 100-round magazines and selling bump stocks or the stance of the NRA is not questioning how much someone loves this country. The reverse is also true, those who question also love this country,
3392 2018-02-22 15:11:38 Improved background checks, raising the minimum age on purchasing guns and banning bump stocks is 'trampling the second amendment'?
3393 2018-02-22 15:11:25 Been right here. I haven't said that AR's need to be banned. So you are arguing with the wrong guy. I even said. Banning bump stocks is not the answer. So........

3395 2018-02-22 15:11:12 Bump stocks have been banned before, and the age restriction is actually a suggestion pushed forward by conservative groups, so this isn't the most surprising.

*Okay* start if it actually happens, but it needs to go further.
3396 2018-02-22 15:11:09 So they throw a bill in with CCW recip and also ban bump stocks and try to fix background checks. We either get a few Dems to cross the aisle and get their side with the CCW recip, OR, they shut it down and the Dems are the ones fighting againt gun control.
3397 2018-02-22 15:11:04 Got an idea, hiw about taking the children if the NRA put them in a school pull the fire alarm and let a crazed person with an AR15 and bumo stocks to hunt them down!  Fuck you kill your own, we want ours safe@DLoesch

3401 2018-02-22 15:10:37 Bump stocks gone? Fine. I am more concerned with the "mental illness" checks, as doctors can be very biased depending on how they vote. However, I strongly feel that this should be tied to a National I.D. Card. You want gun control? Fine. I want TRUE voter registration reform.
3402 2018-02-22 15:10:37 @POTUS You gave the Dems a little and now watch them try to go the whole mile. When will people realize all they do is take? I understand there must be something you have to do but I don't think taking away bump stocks is one.
3403 2018-02-22 15:10:36 The right to own guns fine.. semi and automatic weapons, large magazine, bump stocks, silencers.. absolutely not acceptable.. and how about ghost gun sales and loopholes in gun shows.. shame on you for supporting any of the above. To he'll with the nra...

3405 2018-02-22 15:10:32 Drum mags are notorious for jamming, Bump stocks make AR15 (unless they have heavy barrels overheat and become unusable).  Just because it’s easy to modify is not a reason to take anything of the market. There are millions of AR15 and its use in LV was an aberration,
3406 2018-02-22 15:10:08 Bump stocks are not the issue, only one shooter had them. You need to ban assault rifles and large magazines! Oh forgot you got 30M from the NRA so that's not going to happen! Shithead!
3407 2018-02-22 15:10:05 Trump wanting to ban bump stocks is good, but never forget he incites violence, bragged he could shoot someone and not lose voters, and signed a bill putting guns in the hands of the mentally ill--benefiting gun manufacturers.

#NeverAgain #guncontrol #marchforourlives
3408 2018-02-22 15:10:02 Sure, in decades of production, bump stocks have been used to kill ~60. 

More people have died from lightning, sharks, bricks, etc.
3409 2018-02-22 15:09:55 I agree. Bump stocks were a significant element in the Las Vegas shooting.
3410 2018-02-22 15:09:44 The political Win-Win strategy this spells out for Trump and GOP is obvious. Give up bump stocks and have better background checks? Sure, I am a CC permit carrier and gun owner and I would love to see our CURRENT gun laws enforced, not new ones be made for Liberals to ignore.

3414 2018-02-22 15:09:02 That is not the answer!! Doing your job is the answer. Not making more $ for gun makers. Ban assault weapons, ban bump  stocks, you know things that would work.
3415 2018-02-22 15:08:28 So tRump wants to enact legislation to restrict bump stocks and strengthen background checks

3418 2018-02-22 15:07:21 It is NOT your right. No mention of “bump stocks” or “add ons to weapons to make a well regulated militia”. Maybe read the 2nd Amendment, sometime. Talk about the mass killing in Las Vegas, made possible by bump stocks. SCOTUS has held we can regulate certain weapons. Grow up.
3419 2018-02-22 15:07:11 What, exactly are you going to get done? Are you going to get legislation banning bump stocks? Ban assault weapons? Ban high-capacity magazines?
3420 2018-02-22 15:07:10 I bet the people involved in the Las Vegas shooting didn’t think bump stocks are a joke.

So how do we keep kids from being shot up in schools? Do you have any ideas for making things safer?
3421 2018-02-22 15:07:05 Don't think the have automatic weapons but they have semi automatic and the bump stocks can make them automatic. I think.
3422 2018-02-22 15:06:59 Yes and no, imo. Gun laws should become much, much stricter, stop at selling rifles to adults, minimum age 25, no bump stocks OF COURSE
BUT: There are 200 Million guns out there RIGHT NOW, so schools need be protected for the next years until the new laws have become effective.
3423 2018-02-22 15:06:55 .@realDonaldTrump So your great plan is to ban bump stocks and arm teachers. These are both NRA ideas. You're the President: do you have any ideas of your own?
3424 2018-02-22 15:06:48 @marcorubio: Las Vegas police prelim report, released in Jan: "He bought more than 55 firearms in less than a year, mostly rifles. He also bought more than 100 firearm-related items such as scopes, ammunition and bump stocks in the year before the attack."  *It's not just kids.*
3425 2018-02-22 15:06:46 Mr. President Trump bump stocks being removed from citizens will not help! You want to raise the age to buy rifles above 18 then you need to do the same for military recruitment & draft age! The anti-gun citizens are losing you votes with these decisions you're making.
3426 2018-02-22 15:06:45 This could possibly only be a headline for trump, maybe raise the purchase age and ban bump stocks. Colleges have campus cops why not other schools

3430 2018-02-22 15:06:24 The entire point of the Constitution was to set up a federal government that would not make laws that infringe the rights of the people. Making a law banning bump stocks would be making a law that infringes the rights of the people.
3431 2018-02-22 15:06:12 Yes it does!  It turns a weapon into an automatic rifle.  Bump stocks have already been banned in Massachusetts
3432 2018-02-22 15:06:10 Why bump stocks? Where’s the video of the shooter in Vegas? Why so many inaccuracies? Unanswered questions?

3445 2018-02-22 15:04:54 Please don’t put guns in the hands of teachers. There must be other solutions we can implement to keep our schools secure and children safe. 

• Strict background checks 
• Age restrictions 
• Ban bump stocks
• Ban AR-15s

3446 2018-02-22 15:04:53 @DocThompsonShow I heard the news brief in between the @glennbeck show say that Trump is supporting a ban on bump stocks which will turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic weapon I don't know where she got her facts but they need to be corrected
3447 2018-02-22 15:04:52 Then make sure to pressure Republicans to raise the age on buying firearms. No one under the legal drinking age should be allowed to buy arms. Ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles, and improve background checks. #GunReformNow #GunReform
3448 2018-02-22 15:04:48 You're welcome!  You are also correct!  I will say I don't see bump stocks as the issue based upon my research. That's just a narrative olive branch. 

Mental health also has to address overuse of psychotropics & institutionalizing those who truly need it, an act vacated by WJC.
3449 2018-02-22 15:04:47 Ban all military assault weapons , bump stocks , large volume Ammunition clips!
3450 2018-02-22 15:04:40 Stocks, mental health awareness and better treatment and raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle from 18 to 21. America needs better gun
3451 2018-02-22 15:04:35 I'm glad to see the president, as well as other conservatives, considering banning bump stocks. I still disagree with assault rifles being sold to the general public. I appreciate the respectful dialogue and hope that conservatives and liberals can find a happy medium.
3452 2018-02-22 15:04:19 @CNN This fight will be between the NRA, the government and the American people that stand against assault rifle bans, bump stocks, and any semi-automatic assault guns out there on the market. The American people needs to show the government YOUR VOTES MATTER.
3453 2018-02-22 15:04:08 How about Vegas shooting? If Obama would have stopped sale of bump stocks when he had the opportunity maybe a few more would be alive to Vegas.

3456 2018-02-22 15:04:03 I think Trump has to give Dems SOMETHING so that they will agree to this. They have wanted bump stocks gone for a while. We'll see if Dems still won't work with Trump, even when he tries to give them something.
3457 2018-02-22 15:03:56 Child Education Safety Act. Threat assessment done for all schools, armed teachers (only if teacher is comfortable) retired or active duty military or police act like Air Marshals but for schools. Ban bump stocks, raise the age, mental health and enhance FBI data base. #getitdone
3458 2018-02-22 15:03:53 Bump stocks increase the rapid-fire capability of standard or semi-automatic weapons. They destroy aim, making them only appropriate to fire rapidly into large groups of things. What do you need a bump stock for?
3459 2018-02-22 15:03:50 Bump stocks were not used in the Florida massacre.  They should be outlawed but SO SHOULD ASSAULT WEAPONS. No reason for hunters or citizenry to own them.
3460 2018-02-22 15:03:47 Getting rid of bumps stocks is a shot in the dark ask any US Marine that has qualified expert on a rifle range at 300 yards if A stupid bump stock is gonna give any advantage, a good shooter with a semi automatic style assault rifle can kill fast & Is a force to be reckoned with

3468 2018-02-22 15:03:09 Don’t ban Bump Stocks. You can bump fire without a stock, but the stocks make the gun safer and controllable
3469 2018-02-22 15:03:04 How about banning AR-15s, bump stocks and any other modifications to guns, deeper back ground checks and raising the age to 21 to purchase a gun. Insurance and being able to sue the manufacturer would be good too. Get the @NRA and gun lobby’s bloody Hands out of your pockets!
3470 2018-02-22 15:03:04 Yes, they're complicit. But the Republicans are actively standing in the way of doing ANYTHING with regard to gun control. Even things as innocuous as letting the CDC study this. Even things as ridiculously easy as outlawing bump stocks. It's criminal. And all because of the NRA.
3471 2018-02-22 15:02:54 He called them 'sicko shooters', but completely avoided the idea of making mental health checks a necessary thing before purchasing a gun, and instead suggested that the best thing was to raise the age limit 3 years and ban bump stocks.
3472 2018-02-22 15:02:52 There is a reverse correlation I see with the dot com era: back then institutional investors were able to buy-in first, then retail investors, with the latter driving the price of stocks up. Today the reverse is true: retail investors are first, institutional investors 1/2
3473 2018-02-22 15:02:49 You are falling for the left's propaganda?  I don't care about background checks but I am pretty sure we already have them.  (They failed in this last case.)  I don't even really care about banning bump stocks.  What I care about is the media exploiting this tragedy.  Disgusting!
3474 2018-02-22 15:02:44 Why are you banning bump stocks? Mr. President I am one of your strongest supporters but I have to say I don't understand this. There are already so many restrictions on our 2nd amendment rights even though it clearly states Shall not be Infringed.
3475 2018-02-22 15:02:39 There’s no reason to ban bump stocks. You can bump fire a semi auto with your finger easier.
3476 2018-02-22 15:02:36 Not true. Obama had opportunities to stop the sale of bump stocks and didn't. Look it up.
3477 2018-02-22 15:02:29 Ending bump stocks is good but I don't think the shooter used one.  Raising the age to 21 is good for that and the military.  Check points like the DC principal suggested yesterday is good. Mental Health is good. All of this is common sense.
3478 2018-02-22 15:02:29 Just looked at the Constitution of the United States of America.  Must have missed the amendment about your right to have bump stocks.
3479 2018-02-22 15:02:24 1) Give teachers guns.

2) Talk about thinking about regulating bump stocks.

Done!

3481 2018-02-22 15:02:20 Why not just enforce the laws already in place and hold the agencies accountable for dropping the ball on this lunatic Instead of following along with the political rhetoric or ideas that will not change anything?  It’s not about bump stocks and back ground checks.

3483 2018-02-22 15:02:15 Bump stocks are joke items that, generally, make semi-autos less effective for the users. The focus on them very overblown.

Domestic abusers legally can’t buy guns. We already have that law.

AR-15s are just semi-automatics. Banning semis amounts to nearly a full repeal of 2A.

3485 2018-02-22 15:02:10 FYI Outlawing Bump Stocks is NOT "The Right Thing"

It Will Have ZERO Impact On Maniac Criminals

It Will Only: 

1 Shut Down the Companies That Makes Them

2 Give Tyrant #Libtards An Excuse to Throw Law Abiding Gun Enthusiasts in Jail

3 Force Crazies To Make Their Own (easy)
3486 2018-02-22 15:02:08 Thoughts? I can't care less if he goes and plays golf. The "horse has bolted" re US guns. But if he can successfully ban bump-stocks then he will have done something concrete to improve the situation.

3488 2018-02-22 15:01:57 I think a majority of the country does agree with "common sense" legislation.  Get rid of semi-automatic killing machines.  Bump stocks, no need for those either.  Let's start fixing cultural values in the homes...parents have to work all hours to make ends meet.
3489 2018-02-22 15:01:31 Can you pull up in the constitution where they say you have a right to bump stocks?  I must have missed it.
Also, if we’re handcuffed to a document from over 200yrs old then you should only be able to buy the gun of that era.  Have ALL the muskets you want!

3493 2018-02-22 15:00:25 This is pretty much how we do it in Canada. For long guns: mandatory safety/knowledge test, background check (inc. w/ exes), 28 day waiting period (1st time purchases). Hand guns are harder. Things like suppressors, bump stocks, high capacity magazines are banned. Pretty simple.

3504 2018-02-22 14:59:41 Is it bump stocks that make a semi-automatic an automatic? Sorry to ask. Just not sure. My opinion. An AR15 should not be banned. Bump stocks (if that is what I think it is) should be.
3505 2018-02-22 14:59:41 Do not betray your supporters! Any ban or tax is #infringement. Bump stocks already require special licensing. Banning is a slippery slope!
3506 2018-02-22 14:59:05 Obama had an opportunity to stop sale of bump stocks but chose not to. Why?
3507 2018-02-22 14:59:04 This NRA official shows radical ideals. Gun confiscation is bad unless it is full automatics and bump stocks.
3508 2018-02-22 14:59:01 Never happen. Miracles do happen but not everyone lives in a Walt Disney movie. (I'm sure some think they do). Ban bump stocks, ban silencers and ban AR-15 style weapons. #WakeUpAmerica

3509 2018-02-22 14:58:42 It's less about guns themselves than all the crazy shit you can bolt on them.

3514 2018-02-22 14:57:58 What about the other devices that can do the same as bump stocks? How about banning all automatic & semiautomatic weapons?!! (Or do you just like saying “bump stocks”? Like the way it rolls off your tongue? Like how it makes you think you know about guns?)
3515 2018-02-22 14:57:48 Just looked through all of US history and I cannot find anything stating that bump stocks are your right.
3516 2018-02-22 14:57:47 Why? What did Obama do? Nothing.

3520 2018-02-22 14:57:33 Bump stocks are an accessory and a toy. Nothing to do with your rights. And for all intents and purposes, it does turn a gun into an automatic.
3521 2018-02-22 14:57:20 I’m hoping bump stocks are flat out made illegal so the idiots blowing money on them have to throw them out.
3522 2018-02-22 14:57:20 So you are ok with killing in the womb but not outside of it.  What's the difference.  Also bump stocks are not the problem.  They cause the weapon in question to be highly inaccurate.  So how does it fix the problem.
3523 2018-02-22 14:57:14 They don't need bump stocks in Chicago

3528 2018-02-22 14:56:37 What happened, they heard you wanted to ban bump stocks? Called you on the Money Phone? Puppet.
3529 2018-02-22 14:56:26 Sure, but you'd run into the same stuff as when you try to ban bump stocks.

You're changing something about weapons to make them less dangerous, thus infringing on people's gun rights.
3530 2018-02-22 14:56:13 Nobody needs a bump stock and this young man should not have been able to buy a gun.  That being said, banning bump stocks and raising the age to 21 does absolutely nothing to stop school shootings.  Schools are soft targets, let's address the real problem!
3531 2018-02-22 14:55:59 @JoeNBC and speaking about Trump & talk. Trump wants bump stocks ban. Really, have not noticed one iota of a bill coming from congress to start that happening. Talk is cheap, action by lawmakers count.

3542 2018-02-22 14:54:52 Mr.President we can't give an inch when it concerns our rights. Bump stocks are a non-issue, and we send 18 year olds to fight for our freedoms; we can trust most of them with firearms. And criminals don't take background checks, so extra checks only affect law abiding citizens
3543 2018-02-22 14:54:39 .@GovAndrewCuomo "this is not a substitute for federal action." He said this is not about baby steps of increasing the age to 21 and banning bump stocks. "Let's do something real and make a different."
3544 2018-02-22 14:54:24 Aren't you supposed to start defending bump stocks now that Trump has criticized them?
3545 2018-02-22 14:54:20 Just got my Soros check in the mail today.  I’m going to buy up all the bump stocks so I can jack up the prices on the MAGA idiots when they go on the black market.
3546 2018-02-22 14:54:14 The NRA has been doing the wrong thing for years. They spend millions to ensure bump stocks, and weapons of mass murder, are readily available to the people when they do not need to be. They are accomplices to murder.

We will ban nationwide: all assault rifles, sale & ownership of; bump stocks; ghost gun parts; gun shows; all combat-focused weapons; purchase of guns while under 21.  And we will perfect national database and sharing of data preventing unacceptable weapons buys.
3549 2018-02-22 14:54:12 With all due respect, Mr. President, banning bump stocks is not the answer. However, I fully agree with strengthening the process of background checks and focusing more on mental health. SSRIs have become an epidemic in this country and something needs to be done. #MAGA
3550 2018-02-22 14:54:04 @marcorubio everyone is giving you kudos for showing up last night... That was the easy part. Now show some real courage and  do the right thing. Ban semi-automatic assault rifles, including the ones with plastic stocks
3551 2018-02-22 14:54:03 The NRA will write it.  We’ll get a worthless bill that will ban bump stocks... the only thing they support.

3563 2018-02-22 14:52:40 'All of them, who had stocks in weapons manufacturers, said no.'
3564 2018-02-22 14:52:38 Every time we have a mass shooting, gun sales go up, gun company stocks go up.  Armed teachers shooting back will be the gift that keeps on giving for the NRA. It will mean we have GIVEN UP on actual gun reform.
3565 2018-02-22 14:52:20 Trump responds to #ParklandStudentsSpeak with stricter background checks working especially with mental health & stricter regulations on bump-stocks. Media says NOTHING. Compromise across parties to better our future, I’m only seeing one guy even try up there....
3566 2018-02-22 14:52:08 The bump stocks are not necessary.  Glad you clarified on the mentally ill.

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
3568 2018-02-22 14:51:48 $HIMX a beautiful rolling play with defined ranges. Below $7 is an excellent range to buy OTM calls. #stocks
3569 2018-02-22 14:51:48 If trump is trying pass stricter background checks on Rifle ownership, banning bump stocks, and raising the age to 21 then he's doing the right thing. Bump stocks not needed and if I can't have a beer at 18, I shouldn't be able to buy a gun.
3570 2018-02-22 14:51:33 So this is you winking at the NRA. You say you want to ban bump stocks, change legal age to 21 & arm teachers. @SenateDems @HomelandDems will vote yes, @GOP will vote no & you'll blame the Dems. @NRA still donates to you and your murderous @GOP. All is well in your little world.
3571 2018-02-22 14:51:33 im ok with banning bump stocks,arming teachers,admin,raising age and having armed guards at all schools but im not good with the banning of any tools
3572 2018-02-22 14:51:29 They sent letters to candidates saying "a '?' rating...can be interpreted...as outright hostility, toward Second Amendment-related issues" so it's hard to fathom that going against them in  bump stocks and raising the long rifle purchasing age will not be met with a legit fight
3573 2018-02-22 14:51:27 Did they forget their bump fire stocks.....
3574 2018-02-22 14:51:11 What most people understand is that these people care nothing for human life. And every time there's a mass shooting and an outcry about gun control and nothing gets done, they make a fortune selling weapons to people who are afraid bump stocks might get banned one day.
3575 2018-02-22 14:51:08 Another brilliant diversion by the @NRA. The more time we spend saying “giving guns to teachers is obviously dumb”, it’s less time and effort we are saying take assault rifles, extended clips, and bump stocks away. That’s where their  is. Follow the . #GunLawsNOW #gunlaws
3576 2018-02-22 14:50:51 Another brilliant diversion by the @NRA. The more time we spend saying “giving guns to teachers is obviously dumb”, it’s less time and effort we are saying take assault rifles, extended clips, and bump stocks away. That’s where their  is. Follow the . #GunLawsNOW #gunlaws
3577 2018-02-22 14:50:36 #stocks#StockMarket  For about 98% of all risk averse investors dollar cost averaging into a Total World Stock index  fund with no trading and all dividends reinvested within a tax advantaged account until you retire is probably the best investment you'll ever make.
3578 2018-02-22 14:50:34 If you listen to people on t.v. about stocks.........good luck!
3579 2018-02-22 14:50:22 We can use this as a case against the left that wants to hate Trump no matter what he does. I agree with the background checks, not with ending bump stocks, but if the left still won’t support this, they’ll again reveal how insincere they are.
3580 2018-02-22 14:50:21 I’m talking about bump stocks. Never said one word about the mentally ill.
3581 2018-02-22 14:50:21 I already knew you will jump on this weird suggestion because of your twisted state.. rather than pushing arming so called trained teachers,why not put pressure on congress to amend the #GunControl policies & bump stocks Asap!!! Why put out more guns out there rather than reduce?
3582 2018-02-22 14:50:20 Another brilliant diversion by the @NRA. The more time we spend saying “giving guns to teachers is obviously dumb”, it’s less time and effort we are saying take assault rifles, extended clips, and bump stocks away. That’s where their  is. Follow the . #GunLawsNOW #gunlaws
3583 2018-02-22 14:50:13 She has that backwards. Gun manufacturer stocks go up after mass shootings.
3584 2018-02-22 14:50:07 I honestly believe the people at the NRA love their couuntry & don't want anyone to get hurt but they have got to stop putting money above the best interest of this country.

No US citizen needs assault rifles, bump stocks, extended mags or anything that makes mass murder easier.
3585 2018-02-22 14:50:05 Agree laws need to be enforced,NRA rules are great for more laws.Point is, criminals don't pay attention to laws. Law abiding ppl need more guns to defend themselves. I do like what Trump is talking raising age to 21, outlaw bump stocks, mental health attention, armed guards etc.
3586 2018-02-22 14:50:01 The NRA supposedly has already approved banning bump stocks, yet nothing was done. How about recommending something the majority of Americans want but the NRA doesn’t: like banning assault-style weapons.
3587 2018-02-22 14:49:46 NRA are Good people? The more mass shootings, the more panic of gun bans, the more the stocks go up. Feb 14 SWHC was $10.17/share, Feb 16 $10.91. That's a 7% return in 2 days. If someone had $100,000 invested, they made $7,000 from shooting #NRATerrorists
3588 2018-02-22 14:49:41 Can you manage my stocks please ?
3589 2018-02-22 14:49:38 Bump stocks are so....last October.
3590 2018-02-22 14:49:33 Bump stocks is regarding the Vegas shooting
3591 2018-02-22 14:49:28 Please grandfather the bump stocks that are already owned by law abiding gun owners.
3592 2018-02-22 14:49:13 Trump and Rubio say they'll look at age limits, mental health, background checks, smaller clips, bump stocks. But if either has even said the words BAN ASSAULT RIFLES aloud, I didn't hear it. Maybe it was drowned out by all that applause they got for "listening" to survivors.
3593 2018-02-22 14:49:03 -Raise the age? Sure
-Improve NICS? Depends
-Wrong, can’t ban: Assault rifles are NFA class 3 select-fire weapons, costing 5-figures.
-bump stocks are window dressing. Will do zero and is a distraction.
-Limiting standard capacity mags is a non-starter. Millions in circulation.
3594 2018-02-22 14:48:59 Get rid of the assault rifles, Bump stocks and not let people with mental issues be able to buy guns. Pretty simple. Stop taking blood money from the NRA!
3595 2018-02-22 14:48:51 LTCG tab in portfolio manager is nice feature. Thanks for adding this @ValueResearch
3596 2018-02-22 14:48:50 How is rejecting age restrictions for purchasing guns what's right for the country? Are they supporting your new plan for comprehensive background checks and banning bump stocks? Or has there been a plan correction towards arming teachers? I just need to know what to tell my kids
3597 2018-02-22 14:48:44 @DLoesch Since you didn't answer the question when asked, let ask you again ..."Do you believe that it should be harder to obtain the semi-automatic weapons and modifications for these weapons to make them fully automatic, like bump stocks?”
3598 2018-02-22 14:48:32 Why is everyone talking about bump stocks!? A bump stock is an accessory and it does not convert a rifle to an automatic. ALSO it was first introduced by ATF under OBAMA in 2010 people!!!! Blame Obama and get your facts straight!!!

Assault rifles, or anything resembling something that an average person can buy that is used in the military, or by heavily armed police squads - banned. NRA doesn’t like it? I’ll give them back every penny they donated to my campaign.

3604 2018-02-22 14:48:20 Bump stocks and AR-15s are the tip of the gun iceberg and guns are the tip of the money-in-politics iceberg. And icebergs move very slowly.
3605 2018-02-22 14:48:20 Trump can improve federal agency & military compliance with reporting & reverse the Obama BATF ruling on bump stocks by executive action. Changing mental health reporting requires amending HIPAA & other privacy laws. Doubt he submits legislation

3608 2018-02-22 14:47:55 The NRA is the biggest threat to national security, and it is time to declare outright war on them and the sicko politicians sucking at the teat of gun money. We don't need little bans on bump stocks or slightly more background checks. We need massive new restrictions on guns
3609 2018-02-22 14:47:44 So what you're saying is the NRA put you back in line with what THEY will ALLOW you to take away......they think bump stocks will end our outrage? 
All your concocted idea will do is allow them to sell more guns..WIN WIN for the people putting money in the entire GOP'S pockets!
3610 2018-02-22 14:47:39 I don’t disagree, but I DO think throwing them these meaningless bones is all part of the process. 21 years old. Bump stocks. Improvement to NICS. None of that affects me one bit. Then we can say we did something, now go away.
3611 2018-02-22 14:47:38 Stocks start higher as the truth is. Earnings are spectacular. Rates at 3% is far from scary. We have a steeper curve and accommodative fed. It doesn’t get better than this really.
3612 2018-02-22 14:47:21 Then we should limit who can get the guns. Better back ground check. And no fucking AR-15's or assault rifles or bump stocks. No one needs those.
3613 2018-02-22 14:47:03 People who own oil convinced 2H shortages when seasonality hits.  People who own energy stocks have no conviction except they act bad #OOTT $uso
3614 2018-02-22 14:46:29 Trump saying he'll back raising the age on rifle sales, banning bump stocks, and strengthening background checks. All good policy that plenty of reasonable gun rights supporters support. But after how the DACA debate turned out, I wouldn't trust his statements on any bill.
3615 2018-02-22 14:46:21 Bitcoin down, stocks up.
3616 2018-02-22 14:46:15 Then why aren't they supporting an assault weapons ban?  Bump stocks?  Limit magazine capacity?
3617 2018-02-22 14:45:47 @realDonaldTrump  Mr President you know I love you and everything you are doing and have done. But real talk I think you’re really fucking up with this gun position.  Bump stocks ok cool. Age limit not so much.
3618 2018-02-22 14:45:46 I disagree with the ban on bump stocks. This is a technique. #2ndAmendment
3619 2018-02-22 14:45:43 "Attacking. Is a strong word. Also the incorrect one. But while you try and defend mental helath you should realize the most school shooters were in fact mentally ill. Restrictions and making bump stocks illegal is okay but banning "Assault Weapons" isn't gonna stop anything.
3620 2018-02-22 14:45:39 Raising the Age is Not Going To Do Shit!   But I agree on Bump Stocks!
You just might start a civil war #2018
3621 2018-02-22 14:45:34 People want to ban bump stocks, I want to ban the gun that bump stocks modify.  You can't shoot a bump stock.
3622 2018-02-22 14:45:26 Not saying any of it will actually solve the problem but he’s already directed the DOJ to ban bump stocks and if he’s able to move the legal age to purchase weapons to 21, that does make a substantive difference. Those two things wouldn’t be lip service.
3623 2018-02-22 14:45:13 Guess we’ll have to modify that selective service registration age to 21, not to mention enlistment age. All for banning bump stocks and comp. BG, but also need reporting agencies to follow existing laws and report.
3624 2018-02-22 14:45:12 There horrible people because they’re own interest is MONEY  and continue deaths of young children! Remove assault rifles, bump stocks and rigid gun controls!
3625 2018-02-22 14:45:09 stocks bedroom  
3626 2018-02-22 14:45:07 The thoughts and prayers are more of a “I care about you enough to talk about you to the highest power I know” and offering support. I understand that something needs to happen and president Trump is working on it right now to raise the age to 21 and eliminate bump stocks~
3627 2018-02-22 14:44:56 1st, teachers do not want to be armed. 2nd, how about we spend the 24 Billion “ wall” money on schools installing metal detectors at each door, bullet proof glass and classroom doors. 3rd, ban high capacity load magazines along with bump stocks.
3628 2018-02-22 14:44:46 One refugee gets arrested. Ban all muslims from migrating. Several mass shootings with the same weapon let's not act to hastily here we have a mental health issue not a gun issue we don't need any restrictions at all except for bump stocks which should have been banned aft vegas

3632 2018-02-22 14:43:59 First item I disagree with you Mr. President. It's not the bump stocks specifically that I disagree with but the wording is ambiguous and dangerous.
3633 2018-02-22 14:43:51 I meant bump stocks not glocks.
3634 2018-02-22 14:43:48 Ban
Bump Stocks?

3635 2018-02-22 14:43:46 Understood. Just pointing out that there is a cheaper alternative. It just makes the gun illegal once you make the modification. The gun is what needs to go. The NRA already gave their GOP minions a green light to ban bump stocks after Vegas. Wouldn't have stopped Parkdale.
3636 2018-02-22 14:43:38 Bump stocks make semi automatic rifles fire at a near automatic rate. I know what I said.
3637 2018-02-22 14:43:37 How about common sense? Why do Americans need semi-automatic weapons? Bump stocks? Why have @NRA bought and paid for politicians in Georgia gone against law enforcement to force guns back on the streets? There are no good guys with guns.
3638 2018-02-22 14:43:20 Yet you live in USA one of the biggest laughing stocks of the world.

3640 2018-02-22 14:42:58 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! by #thomaspower
3641 2018-02-22 14:42:57 Why bump stocks????   Why not ALL assault weapons??????
3642 2018-02-22 14:42:53 Gatling adaptors too. It's my belief that one was used at Las Vegas, as well as bump-stocks. The whole handling of #LasVegasShooting was/is botched. No wonder conspiracies prevail.
3643 2018-02-22 14:42:52 Totally oppose raising the age. It would not stop anything, how about just existing current laws. Banning bump stocks wont stop anything  either.

3646 2018-02-22 14:42:47 Banning the sale of bump stocks should only be the start, don't make it the end of the revising of gun laws. Bump stocks sales are soaring right now but those can be easily home-made by anyone with a little mechanical skill for around $20
3647 2018-02-22 14:42:47 So on your own you say you would consider banning bump stocks and raising the age to buy a gun, but when the NRA said no you change your tune! I thought you were your own person with a strong mind. Way to back peddle by doing what you are TOLD to do.
3648 2018-02-22 14:42:43 And high capacity magazines. And bump stocks. And paraphernalia to modify other guns to make them semi-automatic or automatic. And thorough background checks, including psychological evaluations,  fingerprinting, drug screening and interviews. And regulation of sellers.
3649 2018-02-22 14:42:06 Raising the age to 21 is a mistake and so is banning bump stocks.
3650 2018-02-22 14:41:43 @RepFrankLucas 3.  If you see fit to agree to a ban on bump stocks that is fine with me as they have no legit purpose.  But we should get the HPA pushed through as it saves my hearing and my dog's hearing and is sensible.  I legally own suppressors in my NFA Trust but 12mo wait!
3651 2018-02-22 14:41:31 No, the call was for military style assault rifles. You’re the one who kept saying the killing could be done with “any” semi auto. Soooo, large capacity magazines and bump stocks  should also be banned. Give back your blood money.
3652 2018-02-22 14:41:22 Can we hook you up for one of those mental health tests? Ohhhh, look at you ending sale of bump stocks. Not nearly enough. #NRAWhore #ThoughtsAndPrayersDoNothing #NRAKillsKids

3656 2018-02-22 14:41:12 Talk of banning bump stocks is a cop out.  After all most mass shooters did not use bump stocks.
3657 2018-02-22 14:40:54 Why would they protest? Donald Trump is giving them advanced background checks, minimum age 21, longer wait period, ban bump stocks. What's to protest?
3658 2018-02-22 14:40:53 Really Daily News? He talked about banning bump stocks & age restrictions both anti NRA. A lot more than what any previous administration has done. Like the hurt father of his lost child said stop all this Political BS & Do something now!

3662 2018-02-22 14:40:09 He did it with an AR15. He should have never been allowed a gun with his history of domestic abuse. Background checks and stricter gun laws could have prevented it. A ban on bump stocks could have reduced the carnage. Lots could have been done.
3663 2018-02-22 14:40:04 End the sale of.bump stocks, but from my understanding they can easily be made with a few modifications.
3664 2018-02-22 14:40:01 No! Raising the age to 21 will have no effect! And ‘bump stocks’ were not used by this shooter. I don’t support bans like this!!
3665 2018-02-22 14:39:37 Every. Damn. Day.  you say something dumber than the day before.  The NRA is about $.  If it profits them, they’d do it.  They play the 2nd Amendment card to make people believe ‘we’ want to ban guns. Banning assault weapons, bump stocks and suppressors should be a no-brainer.
3666 2018-02-22 14:39:09 How many people in Vegas died because of the bump stocks?
3667 2018-02-22 14:39:05 Its like stocks kinda, you gotta watch the market. Buy when it's low, sell when it's high before it crashes again.
3668 2018-02-22 14:39:02 Oh wow, Trump is gonna put a ban on bump stocks, maybe he's not actually as craz... oh no, he wants more guns and in the hands of teachers. Normality resumes. Carry on.
3669 2018-02-22 14:39:02 You know Donald Trump, you ben Bump stocks is just go underground an you still can buy it. Just like illegal drugs, you know if it is illegal the demand for them go to be high. Just like you can get armor piercing bullets and automatic weapons. It just going slow it down.

3675 2018-02-22 14:38:26 1/ Mr. President, I agree with the push for comprehensive background checks. That makes sense. Also ending the sale of bump stocks, as per your recent memorandum is a solid move. However, raising the age to 21? Does the data support that change?

3686 2018-02-22 14:37:48 Also, automatic weapons - guns that fire as long as you hold the trigger - have been banned for decades. (No more gangsters with tommy guns!) However, loopholes still allow for bump stocks and trigger cranks that convert semi-automatics to pseudo-full-autos.
3687 2018-02-22 14:37:40 $RNVA I'm  buying down here, a lot going on with this one. Ez double from here. #pennystocks #stocks hella thin back to the 7-8s.
3688 2018-02-22 14:37:34 No smart ass. Saying that putting more laws on law abiding citizens doesn't prevent anything. Bump stocks are easy to make and not even necessary. But if banning them makes you sleep better at night go ahead and try. Banning tend to work, like drugs, prohibition, it's lazy policy
3689 2018-02-22 14:37:19 How do bump stocks fit into this?!?! Let's be realistic with each other as to what really happens in these horrible scenarios.  Remember, freedom is a double edged sword,  there is good and bad to everything. Maybe we need to hammer down on the FBI  for not preventing this!
3690 2018-02-22 14:37:18 Yes. Agree. But did USA also mention that he said...
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
3691 2018-02-22 14:36:45 Then WHY did you make it easier LAST YEAR for mentally ill to get guns?  WHY didn't you do something about Bump Stocks after Las Vegas?  NRA said THEY will not allow the age to be raised.  #NeverAgain #MAGA
3692 2018-02-22 14:36:39 You're rigfht. Automatic weapons have been banned for decades. Banning bump stocks that turn semi-automatic weapons into illegal weapons is the right thing to do.  Israel has a gun owner age of 27; 21 is not unreasonable & will do much to prevent school shootings.
3693 2018-02-22 14:36:32 Wrong. Bump stocks will not stop it, nor will raising the age limit. The Columbine shooters will be underage and found a way around it. What additional background checks are you considering? I hope you reconsider the two points I brought up sir. May God bless you and America.
3694 2018-02-22 14:36:28 You insult our intelligence. U won’t do a damn thing & we know it. U could’ve acted on bump stocks months ago but now u r 4 doing something abt them? And anyone who needs a cheat sheet to tell him how 2 react 2 grieving families is beyond pathetic

3696 2018-02-22 14:36:22 When I say I'd made a profit during the day, I meant on other stocks. Not ROKU. ROKU destroyed my overall for the day when the ER were released.
3697 2018-02-22 14:36:19 By that he means that something like 2/3rds of Americans are against gun bans in any form, including things like magazine limits, bump stocks, etc.

He's literally right. Most Americans do not favor bans and this never changes even with tragedies like this.

3699 2018-02-22 14:36:07 USDA detailed 2.9 million acres of rice. Rice prices are much higher from last year as USDA forecasts sharply lower ending stocks at 29.2 million cwt and below a tight benchmark of 30 million cwt of carryout. Expects to encourage 440,000 acre increase.
3700 2018-02-22 14:35:54 Meron din ako sakanila haha. Pero mejo passive ako dun kasi sila na bahala. Try mo stocks talaga as in Ikaw maglalaro pero aralin mo muna. Dami Facebook groups for newbies ng stock market. May free seminars pa
3701 2018-02-22 14:35:53 Just wondering, how many times have bump stocks been used in a crime? Was one used in the Florida shooting?
3702 2018-02-22 14:35:49 Excellent program for crypto @coinspytech_bot and after /start use /add_coin <symbol> to add coins. For instance /add_coin xlmbtc. /rem_coin <symbol> removes a coin. 

At the moment it's possible to add all BTC pairs + BTCUSDT.
3703 2018-02-22 14:35:41 By encouraging supporting and doing nothing, like trump, to stop automatic guns to be used in mass shootings?bump stocks to convert guns for mass shootings. Don't understand why trump is concerned about terrorists. We already have them,,NRA & trump.
3704 2018-02-22 14:35:31 It is bump stocks, not bum stocks and abortion and guns are not mutually exclusive issues. Don't fear your lack of critical thinking skills can be helped.
3705 2018-02-22 14:35:23 There’s literally ZERO need for a civilian to own military assault rifles, bump stocks, etc. NONE. when was the last deer you killed with an AR15?
3706 2018-02-22 14:35:22 As far as what the President has said. I personally don't care about bump stocks, BUT BUT BUT the issue is you give them an inch and they take a mile. Plus anyone who actually knows anything about firearms knows you can increase rate of fire with a fricken stick
3707 2018-02-22 14:35:21 #ChairPowell facing echoes of #GreenspanEra irrational exuberance stocks, #TreasuryCurve conundrum? Not perfectly timed reverse #FinancialRepression, stokes risk of $COMP of 2000? Inverted curve?
3708 2018-02-22 14:35:15 Think it could be said of a lot of cult stocks. Remember AAPL 2012?
3709 2018-02-22 14:35:12 Wrong, Marco, WRONG. Those kids had you dead to rights last night, and you blew it.
Until we BAN ALL auto, semi auto guns and bump stocks, no child in America is safe.
It should be a felony to own weapons of war..no 'grandfathering'. There is no sane reason a civilian needs these
3710 2018-02-22 14:35:09 Stocks bounce back from Wednesday's decline. Dow jumps 135 points. Roku dives 22% after warning of big losses @CNNMoney
3711 2018-02-22 14:34:26 I bought Snapchat stocks weeks before the update. Screwed myself
3712 2018-02-22 14:34:25 It's not over yet. He's got a lot more time to push the stupidity further. Unfortunately both our countries are international laughing stocks right now. But we'll sort it.
3713 2018-02-22 14:34:08 President Trump has many of us concerned, suggesting bans on bump stocks and other modifications to so called assault rifles/weapons. What does that have to do with this school shooting?
3714 2018-02-22 14:33:59 So much for banning gun stocks. Lol. Chode president.
3715 2018-02-22 14:33:51 and exactly how will banning bump-stocks change ANYTHING that has happened at any of the school shootings? There is even a BIG question as to whether or not a bump-stock was used in Vegas.  This is ALL SHOW and no substance!
3716 2018-02-22 14:33:40 Do call it a comeback? Stocks open higher after yesterday's topsy-turvy day. Let's see if it holds.
3717 2018-02-22 14:33:35 If you own 1,000 units of Amazon shares, you've just worth $1.5m. There's nothing as cool as know when to buy stocks and when to sell.
3718 2018-02-22 14:33:25 I think parenting, values, and morals is the problem not guns and bump stocks.
3719 2018-02-22 14:33:24 Do we need Bump Stocks? Should domestic abusers have access to guns? Does ANYONE truly need an AR-15?? I’m not suggesting we do away with the 2nd amendment, but it shouldn’t be a free-for-all. Something needs to change and arming English teachers isn’t the answer.
3720 2018-02-22 14:33:14 At the market open stocks gain as the dollar falls and bonds catch a bid... Will it last?

3722 2018-02-22 14:33:11 So, banning of bump stocks will help, better background checks will help, increasing the age will help. What is the cosmetic talk exactly? I think d best is complete ban but u know that's a long shot for now.

3724 2018-02-22 14:32:59 Had one yesterday, told me bump stocks didn't exist, then researched it and proceeded to try to mix in the Boston bombing and Infowars as the source of "facts".
3725 2018-02-22 14:32:53 MR. TRUMP ... LEADERSHIP STARTS FROM THE TOP!  IF YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY CHANGE AGE FOR GUN PURCHASES, END BUMP STOCKS, AND FIX COMP BACKGROUND CHECKS, YOU SHOULD PUSH THE AGENDA ... DON'T DEPEND ON CONGRESS! AS FOR MENTAL HEALTH, WHY DID YOU CUT BACK FUNDING?
3726 2018-02-22 14:32:53 Good luck  Stocks open higher as 10-year yield eases from 4-year high #markets
3727 2018-02-22 14:32:50 Boys on them stocks lol
3728 2018-02-22 14:32:33 So we finally give the Bush background checks teeth. On mental health, there is a connection to the drugs being prescribed. That still needs to be addressed. As long as the legislation only addresses bump stocks. When it goes above and beyond, there is a problem.
3729 2018-02-22 14:32:19 Bump stocks are pretty pointless.
3730 2018-02-22 14:32:19 the population that owned bump stocks before one was used in a mass murder was probably pretty low in relative terms.  the population that own them now that they are set to be potentially banned, honestly, probably a little too high.
3731 2018-02-22 14:32:13 @peeksoft Just got an Android phone, but when trying to download My Stocks Portfolio it says there is no more room for the "early access program". Is there a way to get the app? No such restrictions on Windows Phone ...
3732 2018-02-22 14:32:04 Leave bump stocks alone
3733 2018-02-22 14:31:58 @thehill HOW MANY MASS MURDERS USED BUMPER STOCKS WHEN ENGAGED ON THEIR KILLING SPREES. ELIMINATING BUMPER STOCKS ARE NOT THE SOLUTION. ANYONE WITH CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED IN A MASS MURDER KNOWS THAT
3734 2018-02-22 14:31:56 What's your plan for getting rid if all bump stocks already legally owned?
3735 2018-02-22 14:31:52 Per NRA approval, bump stocks MAY be banned but it will be repealed at a later date. Who's to say this isn't a bone thrown to the dogs to quiet the voices and give Trump " a win" (since he likes winning)...no one will win
3736 2018-02-22 14:31:52 @RepPeterDeFazio Please value student's lives above values of the NRA. 
No bump stocks, STRONG background checks, NO assault weapons,Min. age 21.
3737 2018-02-22 14:31:22 $MTSL 2s might go imo
3738 2018-02-22 14:31:10 Clear political strategy in dealing with anti-murder/gun violence movement.  Do as little as possible to appear concerned and have taken action.  Ban bump stocks, up age for buying assault/war weapons, mental health.
3739 2018-02-22 14:30:52 I swear to god if he doesn’t enforce these. But since he’s already made it illegal for bump stocks across the nation gives me slight hope
3740 2018-02-22 14:30:51 and a limit on clip size and a ban on bump stocks and much stronger background checks is where i was going w this, mainly the numb stocks thing
3741 2018-02-22 14:30:49 Why bother with bump stocks if we are not going to ban all military style weapons?
3742 2018-02-22 14:30:41 I don't recall bump stocks being an issue in other mass shooting, except  Vegas.

3745 2018-02-22 14:30:31 #Congress #Senate To-Dos:
- Ban bump stocks & any device that speeds gun firing time 
- Limit magazines to 10 rounds
- 21+ to buy any firearm
- Repeal law that prohibits CDC from researching gun violence
- Background check on every gun sale
If not: #ThrowThemOut #NeverAgain
3746 2018-02-22 14:30:31 Or dollar up, stocks up, bonds up, gold up. But for how long? ....

3748 2018-02-22 14:30:13 And banning bump-stocks won't work either!
3749 2018-02-22 14:30:11 Bump stocks are a joke! you can get the same firing rate with your shoulder and finger. Raising the age for getting any gun is not going to stop anything.
3750 2018-02-22 14:29:56 Get rid of the fucking bump stocks, high capacity ammunition and ASSAULT WEAPONS!!  It's pretty simple. 
3751 2018-02-22 14:29:55 So you honestly believe that mass shootings would stop if bump stocks were banned? Ever heard of the black market?
3752 2018-02-22 14:29:48 #stocks  Don't let dweebs and Wall Street technocrats lull you into straying from your investment strategy. Due diligence carefully conducted with patience and resolve always pays off. Stick with quality companies that pay you for your faith in them.
3753 2018-02-22 14:29:48 The 2nd amendment is abt protecting citizens FROM the gov (mil and law enforcement)... that being said, when the actual definition of asslt wpn goes past cosmetics we can have a conversation abt it, but butt stocks, bayonet holders, and composite materials r not dangerous

3758 2018-02-22 14:28:55 Takeaways right now:

1) $USDJPY weakness stands out despite #stocks trying to bounce. Still think risk for $USDJPY to 102-103 area

2) $EURUSD hasn't broken 1.2200, leaving door open for one more push to finally kiss massive falling trend-line off 2008 record high around 1.2650
3759 2018-02-22 14:28:52 None. Bump stocks are designed to turn a semi-automatic rifle into an automatic, as in the case of the Mandalay Bay shooting.
3760 2018-02-22 14:28:43 No. I teach so there will be less violence in the world. If there are guns & shooter drills, I quit even w a teacher shortage on the horizon. Schools are not prisons. No armed guards. Ban military style weapons, bump stocks & hand crank accessories. Reverse the EO you signed.
3761 2018-02-22 14:28:23 I’m tired of @GOP solutions being banning bump stocks or banning a single type of firearm as being good enough. These “solutions” are putting a tiny bandaid on a gaping, large wound. We need to strive for broader solutions and arming everybody isn’t that solution. #NoMoreGuns
3762 2018-02-22 14:28:20 1) Universal background checks
2) New focus on mental health reporting
3) Ban Bump Stocks
4) Increase age limit on all guns to 21.

Am I in the upside down because I agree with Donald Trump. This hasn't ever happened before. Please also ban assault weapons + its cousins.
3763 2018-02-22 14:28:08 Wrong.  Why are you all always so poorly informed??

"strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks"

Also arming specially qualified school staff as a deterrent/countermeasure.

That's just so far.
3764 2018-02-22 14:28:03 There's about to be a run on bump stocks...
3765 2018-02-22 14:28:02 Gun control is important, background checks are very important, and mentally unstable people should have access to firearms. But the right to bear arms is a right. And I think bump stocks need to be out laced
3766 2018-02-22 14:27:36 This morning I saw NRA’s @DLoesch in  a public debate concerning guns, with a student. This student was strong in her argument. But misinformed about the facts. The problem isn’t guns, it isn’t bump stocks or anything material. It’s people, and the likes of them we neglect! #NRA
3767 2018-02-22 14:27:28 Bump stocks are not the problem. If you go too far you will lose support and trust among your base... don't do it!!!
3768 2018-02-22 14:27:28 AGE LIMIT and Mental Health - good compromise. You are not getting support on bump stocks! Criminals don’t follow laws. BUM STOCK BAN Only intrusive on law abiding Citizens.
3769 2018-02-22 14:27:18 I disagree he took a beg step for gun control by banning bump stocks which is a big deal.
3770 2018-02-22 14:26:56 He's changed his position since the shooting, but it's still fairly weak. Bump stocks are easy, banning assault and military weapons is harder, he's not there yet.
3771 2018-02-22 14:26:45 People reload their own rounds these days, they just outlawed bump stocks so that’s a good move. I honestly think schools should have metal detectors at entrances, and maybe even a guard or two (pending size of school).
3772 2018-02-22 14:26:36 Who kno about stocks an can lead me in the right direction? Help me plz!! 
3773 2018-02-22 14:26:28 Gun Control Advocates: We want as ban on Assault rifles
Gun rights Advocates: You're coming for all of our guns
Gun Control Advocates: Nope just assault rifles, but fine, how about just bump stocks. 
Gun Right Advocates: You're coming for all of our guns
Ridiculousness...
3774 2018-02-22 14:26:10 "A mood." The NRA ensured that bump stocks came into existence, with Republican help. YOU signed into law a bill making it easier for mentally ill people to get guns. If Congress does what you said, it'll just be the tip of the iceberg — and you're the iceberg.
3775 2018-02-22 14:25:58 I really want that CB SET and Cheering Fan and Slogan Set but they both have the same deadlineeeeeesssssssss. I hope that the masternims will have enough slots/stocks or extend their deadline so that sellers can open another batch for it 
3776 2018-02-22 14:25:50 You don’t need to be an expert to want change though, this is what is wrong with things. 90% (or close to it) want stronger background checks, a good majority want to ban things like bump stocks and extended mags but politicians don’t stand for the people they stand for the $$$$
3777 2018-02-22 14:25:46 Global Markets: Oops! A six-day rebound in world stocks spluttered to a halt on Tuesday as bond market borrowing costs regained traction and the dollar kicked firmly off a three-year low.

3779 2018-02-22 14:25:33 @marcorubio you are my senator. I’m glad you showed up last night. If you really examine this issue away from the NRA speaking in your ear, in your heart you know that the problem is assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity clips in mass shootings. They all need to be banned
3780 2018-02-22 14:25:28 I don't have a problem with bump stocks and good background checks.
3781 2018-02-22 14:25:18 High capacity magazines, not bump stocks, are what make school and night club shooting so lethal.

3784 2018-02-22 14:25:12 Bump stocks are not an issue, it takes training,practice to even make it operate as intended. It does NOT make a firearm "automatic". An amateur can make most any semi automatic " automatic" with a simple hand file. Maybe we should ban hand files. Why not ban "trigger fingers".
3785 2018-02-22 14:24:58 I love that "banning bump stocks" is one of your top initiatives. It exposes how little our country actually knows about firearms...
3786 2018-02-22 14:24:53 #GunControl has been a difficult discussion. Let's find something that we can agree on. Promote responsible gun ownership, ban bump stocks and universal background checks.

3789 2018-02-22 14:24:22 bump stocks are a band-aid. No civilian should be allowed to own any kind of semi-automatic weapon. Period.
3790 2018-02-22 14:24:17 @NRA I think you have met your match! These "children" have more maturity than @realDonaldTrump to take a stand and push for change NOW! We need their ad! We need their voice over and over again! AR/AK's don't belong on streets! Bump stocks don't belong in hotel rooms...
3791 2018-02-22 14:24:10 You could not be more wrong. Here's a thought, let's start by banning ARs and bump stocks. Let's see what that does.
3792 2018-02-22 14:24:00 Bump stocks may have “helped” in Vegas- far less impact in one of these schools- it’s the high powered weapons and magazines that need to change
3793 2018-02-22 14:23:59 US stocks set for a lower open as investors fret over future rate hikes
Is the bulbble over  bit coin has when from 19,000 to 9,000 it is not looking good !
3794 2018-02-22 14:23:58 Hmm. “Comprehensive background checks”, “emphasis on mental health, “raise age to 21”, “end sale of bump stocks”. Sounds good, per se, but it is @POTUS after all. Won’t believe it until I see it, especially after revoking the mental health law last year.
3795 2018-02-22 14:23:54 But why bump stocks?

3797 2018-02-22 14:23:37 Bump stocks, background checks, arming teachers...all incremental issues to the main issue at hand. Too many guns. Period
3798 2018-02-22 14:23:26 Bump stocks has no effect wast of time and bring false hope.  Raising age is good place to start but exceptions should be made to those serving our country either at home Or abroad.  Law officials need t be giving authority do do there job.  Backgrounds need fixed
3799 2018-02-22 14:23:15 Building a consensus on gun policy ... Share if you agree.

1 Research on gun violence.
2 Universal background checks with mandatory waiting periods.
3 Support services for the mentally ill. 
4 Licences for war machines (bump-stocks, AK-47's, AR-15's, etc).

3800 2018-02-22 14:23:13 as youknow: which acts,  precisely, are “constitutionally protected” is a matter of debate, legal interpretation...

3804 2018-02-22 14:22:49 raise buying age to 21? #Lame 

end sale of bump stocks? why were they ever legal?

arm teachers? #DefinitionOfDumb
3805 2018-02-22 14:22:37 I support arming school staff but we don’t need to raise the age to 21 to purchase a firearm or ban bump stocks.  We’re not criminals and we can’t start legitimizing thought crime.
3806 2018-02-22 14:22:30 My point of view is that the NRA prevents any kind of meaningful improvements to our gun laws. Should people be allowed to buy an AR-15 for personal use? Add bump stocks to make them fully automatic? My opinion is no. The NRA fights all progress in that area and profits off death

Amend the 2nd Amendment into 21st Century.
3808 2018-02-22 14:22:06 I understand attaching bump stock to AR15 makes it one, which is why they're going after bump stocks -- and Trump has acceded to it. :(
3809 2018-02-22 14:21:59 Leave it to Trump to promote a facts based sensable solution (armed teachers) along with afactual nonsense (bump stocks) in one tweetstorm.
3810 2018-02-22 14:21:53 End the sale of all types of bump stocks
3811 2018-02-22 14:21:53 Gun rights have to gain something to it. Any bill must linked to passing National reciprocity and the Hearing Protection Act.

If you're going ban bump stocks then we want sound suppressors in return and National carry
3812 2018-02-22 14:21:49 Ok then. Lets pass responsible gun control legislation addressing mentally ill, bump stocks, semi and auto weapons and AR 15’s. If necessary then let the SCOTUS decide.
3813 2018-02-22 14:21:48 THANKS. I am a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment, and I support banning bump stocks, ending gun sales to people with homicidal or suicidal ideation. I would raise the age for gun ownership to 27 & require 2 years in the military before a gun license is issued (as Israel does)
3814 2018-02-22 14:21:46 @TheDailyShow I get it. This bump stocks thing is a play on words. You are actually bumping up gun stock value by doing nothing. This was trotted out after vegas shooting. Nothing done there either. Well played potus.
3815 2018-02-22 14:21:37 Also you & your NRA friends need to stop misrepresenting what gun control advocates are saying. We do NOT oppose the sale/ownership of hand guns or rifles. We DO oppose the sale of AR-15s & bump stocks & want to see enhanced bkgrnd checks.
3816 2018-02-22 14:21:25 @CNN scripts these questions and use the kids to play on the public's sympathy.  Then @realDonaldTrump says he's proposing stricter gun laws w/a focus on mental health, raising age to 21 & outlawing the sale of bump stocks and I don't see anyone talking about it #agendabasednews
3817 2018-02-22 14:21:07 The Daytona 500 Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally This will be our last chance This is not acceptable even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks the sicko will NEVER attack that school knew of the threat FL
3818 2018-02-22 14:21:06 How are you going to End sale of BUMP STOCKS.  NO WAY!
3819 2018-02-22 14:21:05 If they do anything it'll be bump stocks which they claimed they were doing after Last Vegas but really laid low and did nothing.  It's a start but not nearly enough
3820 2018-02-22 14:20:57 The market stocks might get upset, though. Oh crap, there is that common sense hating money thing again.

3822 2018-02-22 14:20:50 2/2. With stocks it's much more transparent and relevant. Mar S&P is equal to 10% of daily volume of STAWKS. Institutions are using them to hedge derivatives, and securities that have been sold and bought back from Customers. Yes, futures not matter, but not so much to bitcoin.

3825 2018-02-22 14:20:38 Bump stocks aren’t the problem, AR-15 sales are. Only Military & Police should be allowed to have them.
3826 2018-02-22 14:20:10 Damn that autocorrect!! I meant to say “Bump” stocks! 
3827 2018-02-22 14:20:09 There are now more than 70 times as many stock market indices as there are quoted stocks globally, according to research from the IIA’s Index Data Survey.
3828 2018-02-22 14:19:58 2/18/18 Part II-Gun safety legislation-I favor outlawing bump stocks. We should strongly consider reinstating a ban on military style assault weapons for civilian use. Hunters should hunt & people should legally purchase weapons to defend their homes, themselves & their families.
3829 2018-02-22 14:19:56 The NRA didn't want bump stocks debated in congress because the potentially broad reaching outcome was out of their hands.
So Trump changed it to be reviewed by the ATF. This way the review would be much narrower in scope and easier to control.
Don't be fooled by their rhetoric.
3830 2018-02-22 14:19:45 Agreed, or hire a couple former military. Or even have a local officer at every school. But other than Banning bump stocks which I could care less about, raising the age to 21 though it won't affect me, what about soldiers in the military that are under 21?
3831 2018-02-22 14:19:34 Amen Mr Pres  bump stocks should have been a banned mod the day after Vegas
3832 2018-02-22 14:19:21 Remove scamming fake meds out of mental health and have an extensive spiritually replacement therapy package option, everything else is fun 21, that was a demon stragetically left in place(20/20), put rapid fire in the buttocks instead of butt stocks paddle holstered by P.E.
3833 2018-02-22 14:19:21 Halting sales of Bump Stocks doesn’t hurt the firearms business at all, eh Mr Puppet of the NRA?
3834 2018-02-22 14:19:05 I think the bump stocks will go, some of these KIDS sound so much more intelligent than,  well, a lot of adults. I think they will make a change.
3835 2018-02-22 14:19:00 Conciliatory towards victims, certainly. The actual actions he's proposed are executive: strengthening the background check system compliance, & reversing the Obama Administration ruling that bump stocks are legal. His base isn't threatened by those
3836 2018-02-22 14:18:58 Because "assault weapons" is a leftist term to describe guns with additional rounds or bump stocks. It's a catchphrase that really doesn't mean anything in the gun world.
3837 2018-02-22 14:18:58 I think we need better background check, and, I wouldn’t outlaw assault weapons, but , they need to raise the age to purchase an outlaw numb stocks!! Without our weapons this country would be at the whims of every idiot in Washington!  Take a look at pre WWII Germany! 
It is sad.
3838 2018-02-22 14:18:58 I remember you (cnbc) pumping the Natural gas stocks......many of us lost money on those very poor stock reccomendations........if someone is making stock purchases based on any t.v. stock pickers recommended stocks.....all I say is GOOD LUCK!
3839 2018-02-22 14:18:40 The limit of what will happen in 2018:   A ban on bump stocks, and raising the age of rifle purchases to 21.  Just enough to allow (R) in swing districts to run ads saying "took strong decisive action on assault weapons" and make it look like they've got some spine RE: the NRA.
3840 2018-02-22 14:17:52 None. However, 58 or 59 died bc of them in the Las Vegas Massacre. It's been almost five months now and @realDonaldTrump and the Repubs have still failed to ban bump stocks. R they that slow, that they need another 5 or 6 months to regulate guns in light of Parkland?
3841 2018-02-22 14:17:26 Arming teachers isn't the answer. Increasing school security, hardening the targets, employing retired military & police officers all would have a positive impact. Most of all, we must address the mental health crisis. I'm also good w/ banning bump stocks. #schoolsafety
3842 2018-02-22 14:17:21 These are lies & false narratives. What’s being asked is an increase in purchasing age to 21. You can’t drink until you’re 21, what’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with ending the sale of bump stocks so semi-automatics can be upgraded to fully automatic. How about starting there?
3843 2018-02-22 14:17:20 Mr President @realDonaldTrump Please hire professional security consultants to survey schools and present a comprehensive security package to “hardened” schools (increase physical security) as well as discuss decrease in magazine capacity & banning bump stocks! Look at Everything
3844 2018-02-22 14:17:13 stocks rise bcs inv believe the CB can fix it although since fin crisis ended they haven't gotten much right about interest rates, GDP, inflations, yields, etc. Data dependent is their mantra meaning they make it up as they go along & say something that keeps inv believing
3845 2018-02-22 14:17:11 Never said i don’t like politics. I don’t like people arguing blindly due to their political agenda. I believe trump when he says he’s going to raise age for guns, increase background checks and get rid of bump stocks.
3846 2018-02-22 14:16:53 Bloomberg reported that some firearms auction platforms are listing the bump stocks and adding “get them while you can, guys.” 
Bump stocks can often sell for less than $200, but the report said some auction prices hit $1,000.
SAD!
3847 2018-02-22 14:16:48 “Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue”
3848 2018-02-22 14:16:11 True I think Massachusetts passed a ban on bump stocks and acted surprised when only 4 were turned in.
3849 2018-02-22 14:16:08 So, @realDonaldTrump wants us to believe that he’ll ban bump stocks, and shield students from another massacre, but he’s yet to sign the Russia sanctions. Hmm. Leads me to believe that nothing will happen. #GunReformNow
3850 2018-02-22 14:16:03 The "relative value" idea of Long European Stocks vs, "expensive" US growth stocks lost a lot of people a lot of money in the last 6 months
3851 2018-02-22 14:16:01 If you ban AR-15’s then Bump Stocks wouldn’t be needed!
3852 2018-02-22 14:15:59 BTW the ATF ruled on bump stocks not Obama . I’m not saying PBO couldn’t have tried to do something but bump stocks weren’t his doing as is being misrepresented...just a side note
3853 2018-02-22 14:15:45 Please forget the age and bump stocks but keep comprehensive background checks for mental illness
3854 2018-02-22 14:15:40 Having those parents and students into WH to talk with you was the right thing to do. I like the things you propose, but banning bump stocks isn't good enough. We can't have AR15's Assault rifles on our streets. They are effective KILLING MACHINES made for use by military only.

3856 2018-02-22 14:15:34 I can’t get over all the lies Dana Loesch told. One, the NRA has repeatedly lied about supporting bans on bump stocks. After Vegas, they stopped legislation from passing. 1/ #StudentsStandUp #NRABloodOnYourHands
3857 2018-02-22 14:15:32 FYI NRA recommended in public statement that ATF restrict bump stocks .......
3858 2018-02-22 14:15:32 Watching Rubio speaking to poor Father of 1 killed students...R : "we will ban bump stocks", they just don't get it !! We are NOT wanting them to just not get shot faster you moron.... assault weapons what IS this guy missing ?! VOTE them out !
3859 2018-02-22 14:15:26 If trump bans bump stocks I got a strong feeling he'll be a one term  president ...   I'll jump off the trump train .
3860 2018-02-22 14:15:23 Those are words. I’m looking for deeds. Justice department can’t ban bump stocks. @POTUS needs to cancel his EO making background checks more loose & demand legislation for increased age requirements & a ban on bump stock & hand crank firing.
3861 2018-02-22 14:15:17 Instead of banning guns and bump stocks why don't we ban Soros, fire sessions, get an AG with a pair, arrest Hillary and all Obama/criminal party! Hold people accountable for their crimes!?? The NRA didn't shoot anybody!! Build the wall!! I want to vote for you again sir!
3862 2018-02-22 14:15:16 Did some jumping around a bit the first few years. Didn't do so well in futures. Have found some consistency in stocks in play, and i had some consistency with ZN scalping. But i was used to making trades everyday with stocks, so i have moved away from ZN a bit. Do miss the DOM
3863 2018-02-22 14:15:11 I need someone with experience in stocks
3864 2018-02-22 14:14:46 Realistically, bump stocks aren’t an issue. I don’t think we should be throwing them a bone when it comes to the second amendment.
3865 2018-02-22 14:14:44 @Queen_Europe Ms Merkel what is happening in the United States is indignant, the Dow Jones keeps on pussy footing while military stocks are reaching the roof! The news and politicians responses are below educated levels!
3866 2018-02-22 14:14:43 The one on the right was a limited deal from a 3rd party supplied item which was on a deal while stocks lasts and now the price has reverted back to its original.
3867 2018-02-22 14:14:37 Nice hearing someone at my work @Tom_Stocks on @TwoShotPod talking about opening those often tightly shut doors in this industry!
3868 2018-02-22 14:14:32 Sooo the #NRA is allowing you to put fwd low hanging fruit re gun control? Why bump stocks now & not immediately after #VegasShooting. #Trump in a mood td something. Maybe because #Florida is a swing state and you want those seats in 2018 and 2020 (if you can run).
3869 2018-02-22 14:14:29 Fully automatic we made illegal in the 30's and Reagan signed a bill in 89' that converting a semiautomatic to automatic illegal. Obama's ATF legalized bump stocks contrary to the 89' law.
3870 2018-02-22 14:14:19 @StephMillerShow @KarlFrisch I think trump went to the nra and said, "you have to give me something for a win on guns" and they came back and said "bump stocks". Of course they're not made by gun manufacturers, but a third party so it won't hurt the bottom line of their overlords
3871 2018-02-22 14:13:55 @realDonaldTrump I'm a huge president trump supporter . I've Been on the train since day one .. but if he bans bump stocks and other devices  he will not get my vote next president election  everyone I know says they will get off the trump trian ..may be one term president ..
3872 2018-02-22 14:13:47 In 2010 - 606 people died of accidental shootings. Most under 18. Putting guns in schools may “deter” some school shooters, but you will likely end up with as many deaths. You have to focus on high capacity magazines, background checks, bump stocks, along with mental health.
3873 2018-02-22 14:13:33 Yes give thought about it. But I’ve never been one to trust my money to chance. Stocks, lottery etc etc. I always look for a sure thing when it comes to money.
3874 2018-02-22 14:13:20 I would own a gun myself as an adult if it wasn't for my expensive tastes in guns and not wanting a 1400-2000$ paper weight haha. But I am for common sense which AR15 style weapons, 100 round magazines and bumps stocks need not exist.
3875 2018-02-22 14:13:16 You're absolutely right he's not a law maker. All he's done is sign EO's after whining about Obama doing it.
He won't do anything with guns either except keep pandering to his fans and make them feel like banning bump stocks is actually doing something to help.
3876 2018-02-22 14:13:12 And you are basing this on What? You know a few days ago I thought you were acting presidential by meeting with the kids and banning bump stocks, but then the NRA got in your ear and this is the tweet recommendation you send out? This is sickening! I dont want my kids in a prison
3877 2018-02-22 14:12:56 Ban bump stocks! Why would we want something that is going to make semi-automatics fire faster, the slower the gun fires the less people are harmed and the more time the police have to get there! #GunControl #GunControlNow
3878 2018-02-22 14:12:50 Ha ha it’s literally funny. The GOo will get even more seats which is rare in a midterm. Great tax bill that helped almost every tax payer, more money in paycheck, stocks and economy rolling, they will get permanent DACA deal and will do some gun reform. All great things
3879 2018-02-22 14:12:45 LONDON: stocks down another -0.9% this morning taking the FTSE to -4.8% YTD vs. the NASDAQ at +4.7% YTD 

Long US Growth vs. UK (or Europe) is still crushing it
3880 2018-02-22 14:12:41 I don’t understand the NRA’s opposition to things that either don’t affect second Amendment rights or are just common sense. Why oppose research in gun violence? What harm does that do? Why oppose banning bump stocks? Automatic weapons are already illegal.
3881 2018-02-22 14:12:37 i think he still has stocks with moonshit
3882 2018-02-22 14:12:29 I'd wait until later this year or next year to hike rates,  especially since wages are rising in blue states which causes rich people to panic and get shifty with stocks, stupid I know,  but that's our insane system.
3883 2018-02-22 14:12:20 Cnbc headline for 4pm today:

Stocks Shrug Off Rising Yields to finish positive
3884 2018-02-22 14:12:19 Bump stocks should be illegal, but banning them wouldn’t have prevented the Parkland shooting. Background checks are essential. This is a start...
3885 2018-02-22 14:12:17 Auto stocks also fell. Tata Motors was down 1.59%, Maruti Suzuki India  1.47%, Eicher Motors 2.01%, Ashok Leyland 0.04%, Bajaj Auto 1.24%, and  Hero MotoCorp declined 0.23%. However, TVS Motor Company gained 0.39%.
3886 2018-02-22 14:12:12 Universal background checks
Gun registration
Ban assault rifles
Mandatory safety lessons pre-purchase
Required locked storage
Mandatory waiting period pre-purchase
Ban bump stocks
Close the gun show loophole

3887 2018-02-22 14:12:11 $TYL missed revenues and guided 2018 revs lower but did raise earnings per share. Growth stocks cant miss revs in this environment
3888 2018-02-22 14:12:10 Don't hear much of the Vegas shooter anymore and It was a horrific accident maybe a false flag? I'm sure bump stocks are flying off the shelves as we speak just like any gun legislation it just makes things worse when we try to take away rights of other Americans.
3889 2018-02-22 14:12:08 Most PSU bank stocks declined. SBI was down 0.18%,  United Bank of India 1.79%, Union Bank of India 1.82%, Bank of Baroda  1.65%, Canara Bank 0.61%, Allahabad Bank 0.1%, Dena Bank 0.96%, and  PNB 2.09%. Bank of India was flat. However, Syndicate  Bank was up 1.19%,

3891 2018-02-22 14:12:06 Obviously I agree 100%, but the weapons need to be addressed. He’s not addressing the weapons and hoping banning bump stocks will be enough to pacify people. It won’t be enough even though it’s a start.
3892 2018-02-22 14:12:03 Bump stocks need to be banned.  Nobody needs a machine gun.  Raise the age to purchase any long gun that can fire more than xx rounds per minute or holds more than xx rounds.  You're right about the 16-18 year olds (I would extend it to 25).  Their brains aren't fully wired yet.
3893 2018-02-22 14:11:56 Mental health is ok.  Banning bump stocks is not going to save lives. Just another BS effort to appease the ignorant masses.   How about putting bulletproof doors and windows around classrooms?  Putting armed guards at school entrances!!!   What a novel idea!!!
3894 2018-02-22 14:11:55 With 45 and others making noise about banning bump stocks, it seems like maybe it's time to talk about the Las Vegas shooting? So in 4 months, maybe we can talk about Parkland...
3895 2018-02-22 14:11:54 RIP  honestly I'm mad rn and I don't even trade stocks 
3896 2018-02-22 14:11:38 Intensive background checks mental health checks wtf? Trump saying he’ll ban bump stocks why? For publicity! Teens that were wounded refused to talk to trump it’s all about him Narcissistic selfish complete  lack of empathy as a human being in general
3897 2018-02-22 14:11:32 Telecom stocks declined. Idea Cellular was down 2.4%, Bharti Airtel  0.79%, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) 2.24% and Reliance Communications  fell 2.14%. MTNL jumped 7.78%.

3900 2018-02-22 14:11:22 We don't need to raise the age to purchase guns. It should remain 18. Bump Stocks should be left alone, no nut in Vegas uses it incorrectly and we want to ban. The FBI needs to do it's job and follow up on all tips.
3901 2018-02-22 14:11:20 Why didn't you act on bump stocks after Vegas?  You're despicable.
3902 2018-02-22 14:11:07 I don't disagree with raising the age to purchase guns, to ban bump stocks, I mean good steps, but they are baby steps, if we aren't including funding to CDC to do research and public health programming to address gun violence, we will be falling far short of where we need to be.
3903 2018-02-22 14:11:01 True.  I say banning one type of gun won't work;  they say Wall won't work.  I will trade AR 15s for the Wall, and throw in Bump Stocks for free.  ...ooorrrrr - how about 1 way into school past metal detectors - you cannot stuff an AR, rifle or shotgun into a backpacks

Latest News Updates
3908 2018-02-22 14:09:58 Yes bec ive been tweeting since 3 yrs ago about stocks
3909 2018-02-22 14:09:47 A start. How old was that guy in Vegas who used bump stocks though?
3910 2018-02-22 14:09:37 Bump stocks are not the problem. Assault weapons that should only be in a war zone are the problem. And a Wild West shoot out in schools is no solution. That leads to teachers shooting teachers, teachers shooting students and swat teams shooting teachers. Mass confusion.
3911 2018-02-22 14:09:29 be the first one to make a difference. Eliminate bump stocks, raise the age limit to purchase (exempt ex-military with two or more years of honorable service),  expand background checks, improve school screening systems, allow teachers to carry. NRA and public should approve.
3912 2018-02-22 14:09:22 SWISS Stocks down again this morning and -4.3% YTD #EuropeSlowing
3913 2018-02-22 14:09:17 Bump stocks are irrelevant...someone who wants to make one will. Mental health and background checks are the key. Guns don't shoot themselves. Age to buy guns raised? So the age to enter the military will now be 21? I think the age to vote should be raised to 21 as well.
3914 2018-02-22 14:09:14 Who uses Bump stocks? Nobody moron. The US is the only country in the world with this problem and the only country in the world with such easy access to assault rifles. What do you need a nobel prize winner to explain it to you? Really? Even U should get it.
3915 2018-02-22 14:09:12 So does that mean you won’t let ppl fight in wars @ 18? Does that mean they aren’t adults until 21? How can you be an adult but have limited rights? Also would you support banning rubber bands? bc that’s all you need, bump stocks are cosmetic.  Evil always finds a way #Liberty
3916 2018-02-22 14:09:10 "Our gun laws are pretty damn good." -@GovChrisSununu
No waiting period
No permit needed
Concealed carry
Bump stocks allowed
Schools are not allowed to ban guns

"All the laws in the world won't change this." -@GovChrisSununu #nhpolitics
3917 2018-02-22 14:09:06 Sadly this will die down as it has with every other shooting. I mean Las Vegas if anything should have spurred something and it has only spurred a look into if bump stocks are legal......sorry but there is zero need for bump stocks to exist.
3918 2018-02-22 14:09:05 Bump stocks are shunned by most gun owners. No more compromise with the left on the Second Amendment. The left wants guns banned, period. Continued compromise will get them there.
3919 2018-02-22 14:09:04 You forgot better gun registration eliminate auto weapons and things like gun stocks, require training and insurance.  And require registration at gun shows,  deal with it unrestricted gun ownership is no longer acceptable.
3920 2018-02-22 14:09:03 I have a huge problem with it. They get nothing. They don't get one single thing to ban. No bump stocks, no matter the ridiculousness of them, DEFINITELY no extended mag bans & if an 18 yr old can die for this country, negative on age limits. "Shall not be infringed".
3921 2018-02-22 14:09:03 Bump stocks definitely need to go, turning a single fire weapon to full auto should be illegal
3922 2018-02-22 14:08:56 Raising age and bump stock ban will be@most effective. Most if not all school shooters have been under 21!

Finally, you have a chance to do something right. 

Please raise the age, and ban bump stocks!

Less than 5% afflicted with mental illness are perpetrators of violence!
3923 2018-02-22 14:08:51 Criminals will always have bum stocks and anything else.
3924 2018-02-22 14:08:43 Hearing trumps proposed legislation ideas, i gotta day I’m not pissed off at all. Raising age, bump stocks, and arming teachers......it’s about compromise folks, and i think his ideas are pretty good.
3925 2018-02-22 14:08:26 Since Trump banned bump stocks, would this make all the liberals shut up about gun control?
3926 2018-02-22 14:08:19 Probably someone said bump stocks r ok to get rid of in order to pacify. But what bump stocks killed students?
3927 2018-02-22 14:08:16 @CNN "Bump stocks" should B a "no-brainer". RWers R using that issue as a way to dodge serious questions about who should have a gun. Trump should immediately rescind HIS orders weakening rules on mentally ill & "no-fly"list people buying guns.
3928 2018-02-22 14:08:13 Banning stocks to acknowledge auto rifles are an issue but won't ban the guns themselves. Doubt this tweet will lead to anything significant if anything at all
3929 2018-02-22 14:08:11 David i'M a 68 yr old grandmother. Who grew up and used hunting shot guns. However, i and my husband are totally against the use of assault rifles and bump stocks! The belong in the military & swat squads.Stay in for the long haul, & stay strong. TOTAL BAN ONLY ANSWER

3931 2018-02-22 14:07:48 An AR-15 is not an “assault weapon.” Pistols have been used to commit mass murder too. Better background checks and ban on bump stocks is a better answer. People have changed, guns have not.
3932 2018-02-22 14:07:33 So does the NRA and the gun industry. Gun and ammunition sales go through the roof everything one of these happen. After Vegas the company making bump stocks had to stop taking orders because they could not keep up.
3933 2018-02-22 14:07:23 No- I'm all for hand guns/single shot riffles-owned by responsible people who have passed a mental health evaluation.  I am against bump stocks- auto assault riffles- these were not made for hunting or self defense- they were made to pit armies against armies.
3934 2018-02-22 14:06:57 Meanwhile gun sales (and bump stocks) are about to erupt
3935 2018-02-22 14:06:35 1. How about finally forcing states to report mental health issues and criminal convictions to the NICS?
2. How are 20-year-olds supposed to defend themselves then?
3. Yes, get rid of bump stocks. But make sure to ban ONLY bump stocks!
4. No executive order - Congress must do it!
3936 2018-02-22 14:06:11 Bob Farrell’s Rule #7: “Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they arrow to a handful of blue chip names”.  Just three growth stocks have accounted for nearly half of this year’s 1% gain in the SPX.<1/2>
3937 2018-02-22 14:06:04 We have comprehensive background checks, but the government sucks at everything so they screw it is. 21 for guns is assinine. Mental health provision may gut privacy. Bump stocks... meh.
3938 2018-02-22 14:05:51 Don't brag about going to do it. It's energy used on a useless tweet. Get back to us when you're banned bump stocks and made the changes... then we'll praise you. Also make sure it actually goes through to prove you're not sucking off a gun lobbyist. -Kind regards this Asshole
3939 2018-02-22 14:05:37 Good. Now replace ban assault rifles/military-style guns for ban bump stocks and we're getting somewhere.
3940 2018-02-22 14:05:33 PPT working overtime last night in bonds and stocks. they don't own an umbrella for this perfect storm.
3941 2018-02-22 14:05:17 Agree it is a bandaid but it wouldn't be a big deal.  Making bump stocks illegal to sell is also a mere bandaid but wouldn't be a big deal.
3942 2018-02-22 14:05:08 And banning bump stocks. And by using the phrase " I'll vote to take that right away" re: extended mags, BStocks & "some" semi auto rifles.
3943 2018-02-22 14:04:36 Bump stocks are the hub caps on cars (unnecessary)...you’ll still die at the hands of a drunk or deranged person...gun or car.
3944 2018-02-22 14:04:18 Banning bump stocks are no good unless you ban the guns they attach to!! Bump stocks can't shoot bullets!
3945 2018-02-22 14:03:55 “Assault weapons” have illegal for decades you uneducated snowflake. For the last time the A.R. 15 is not a fully automatic assault weapon it is a semi automatic sporting rifle. And your precious Obama said bump stocks are A-OK!
3946 2018-02-22 14:03:42 Wow Ben - you liberals are so understanding.  Your language just reflects who you are.  Has any other President ever done what this President did yesterday and listened to the victims and their families? Nope. Obama did nothing.  Actually bump stocks were made legal under Obama.
3947 2018-02-22 14:03:14 That’s great turn school into a war zone !  Donald you ever hear of shootout and crossfire ? You want students to be caught up in crossfire or a shootout ? No buddy just ban assault rifles bum stocks
3948 2018-02-22 14:03:09 "bitcoin is so stupid, it's only valuable because people say it is" right, unlike paper money, gold, diamonds, or stocks which all have intrinsic, never changing value handed down by God.
3949 2018-02-22 14:03:08 Bump stocks are an ACCESSORY-not a weapon!!! Does NOTHING about assault weapons being available. You are either deliberately misleading or stupid. I don't know which is worse.
3950 2018-02-22 14:03:00 You can't always stop a maniac. I support banning bump stocks.
3951 2018-02-22 14:02:38 #inWakanda Pink hair lotion stocks just went up
3952 2018-02-22 14:02:29 @realDonaldTrump BUMP STOCKs just need to be regulated like suppressors or automatic weapons. automatic weapons have been banned for direct sale without ATF apporval since 1934.
3953 2018-02-22 14:02:18 @realDonaldTrump will you support guns at government offices, congress, whitehouse, courts, trump properties too? Make America Somalia/Yemen? More guns are not the answer. #GunReformNow. Ban assault weapons, high cap magazines, bump stocks. @NRA are terror lobbyists. #GunLawsNOW
3954 2018-02-22 14:02:14 You guys were crying about bump stocks after Vegas. GTFOH
3955 2018-02-22 14:02:06 Trump has apparently decided to push for "Comprehensive" background checks, raising the age to buy...some kind of firearms...and end the sale of bump stocks.  He's certainly under the influence of the last people he talked to, so what's the over/under on when he flip-flops?
3956 2018-02-22 14:02:01 Both these bank's stocks are trading at par with their book value. Private banks are trading 3-4 times of their book value. Whereas others PSU Banks are trading below half of their book value due to high NPA.
3957 2018-02-22 14:01:59 Bump stocks weren’t used in this last shooting. What about AR 15s??
3958 2018-02-22 14:01:46 Bump stocks?  How about ALL AUTOMATIC WEAPONS!

3961 2018-02-22 14:01:18 @RepJeffDuncan I disagree with raising the age, many young adults use hunting as a means to provide, , want to mandate hunter safety course prior to sale, no problem   the 2nd amendment does not give exceptions to how a gun looks, bump stocks,  are not easy to use,
3962 2018-02-22 14:01:15   he gets rid of bump stocks and increase the age/ makes mental background checks harder but if him and most of Congress are already getting paid by the NRA imagine who's paying for those guns for teachers? Not the government. The training? Not the government.

3964 2018-02-22 14:00:47 Big difference between asking DOJ to ban bump stocks (which may not be legal) and asking/pressuring Congress to do it.  Not sure he knows the difference though.

3966 2018-02-22 14:00:30 Uh, bump stocks aren't automatic weapons.
Why are you talking about this given how ignorant you are?
3967 2018-02-22 14:00:05 USDJPY coming off as stocks hold losses.
3968 2018-02-22 14:00:04 He will demand a gold-plated border wall for bump stocks ban. 

Also, this will drag out close to midterms and become a promise platform issue for GOP.

3971 2018-02-22 13:59:39 Absolute lie. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and large capacity ammunition and mass shootings will stop.
3972 2018-02-22 13:59:31 I still have the temptation to go back to volatility. UVXY SVXY. But I won't. From now on, only ETFs that are backed by stocks will be bought.
3973 2018-02-22 13:59:26 Bump stocks are not the problem. The knives, saline solution, and suction machines used by abortion Drs. to kill almost a million babies a year are the problem. Banning bump stocks is a sop to the crazy left/democrats. Let's hope it doesn't happen.
3974 2018-02-22 13:59:21 And many of us who own guns and train others in their safe use support background checks, stricter gun laws, and laws against civilian high fire-cycle weapons and automatic home-kitting like bump stocks.

I don't respect gun runners. 

Or David Brooks, for that matter.
3975 2018-02-22 13:59:20 There is a difference between owning AR-15s with bump stocks, etc. and having personal handguns for protection.... Why are you having such a hard time understanding the difference? Again, I am a conceal carry gun owner.. I have my piece on me all the time.. I own multiple guns
3976 2018-02-22 13:59:16 Why all of a sudden are bump stocks any issue
3977 2018-02-22 13:59:08 @realDonaldTrump will you support guns at government offices, congress, whitehouse, courts, trump properties too? Make America Somalia/Yemen? More guns are not the answer. #GunReformNow. Ban assault weapons, high cap magazines, bump stocks. @NRA are terror lobbyists. #GunLawsNOW
3978 2018-02-22 13:59:05 I like how I’m so despondent these days that I actually thought @realDonaldTrump might have his “EPA” moment with bump stocks but NOPE. Within 24 hours he’s to the worst idea possible for solving the problem.
3979 2018-02-22 13:58:25 My guess is, this is a lie and he will do nothing about background checks. And, why ban bump stocks if you won't ban assault weapons?
3980 2018-02-22 13:58:19 And bump stocks were an issue with last shooting and everyone had already agree to ban. Not doing anything new here
3981 2018-02-22 13:58:11 S32 hasn't exercised option yet. On a proforma basis, still ultra cheap relative to peers. You have gold stocks trading at 2-4% of in situ, zinc stocks trading at 1-2% in situ... the copper space is broadly undervalued with quality companies trading at under 1% in many cases.
3982 2018-02-22 13:58:02 How many died in Las Vegas because of bump stocks? You are clueless, Krassenstein.
3983 2018-02-22 13:57:46 Dana Loesch, answer Emma’s question!  Do YOU believe bump stocks should be made illegal to every day people!
3984 2018-02-22 13:57:35 Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Ban large bullet clips. They don’t belong in a civilized society. Mass shootings will stop.
3985 2018-02-22 13:57:34 Bump stocks, let alone guns have never been responsible for a single shooting. 

What are your plans for those that have bump stocks? FYI, Mr. President, bump stocks are crap. 

I voted for you, but this is crap legislation. Do you think the Dems will stop at bump stocks?
3986 2018-02-22 13:57:33 Trending and Relevance Algorithms are like bump stocks for interestingness and awareness. It’s only slightly easier to dodge interesting content.
3987 2018-02-22 13:57:23 Can also write a mandate that weapons are removed by local police when people are in crisis - ie suicidal, threatening etc. Yes, no bump stocks.  But to say the NRA is blocking change ignores the rest of the issues.
3988 2018-02-22 13:57:20 Agreed. Laws and and protocol breakdown is responsible for #Parkland. With that said bump stocks are really dumb and I’m not going to cry too hard about a ban. Inaccurate, causes overheats and jams.
3989 2018-02-22 13:57:14 Mr President,bump stocks r not the problem. Mentally ill idiots are the PROBLEM!  Take a look at Denver CO. Police chief bans bump stocks,and requires u to turn them in. NO ONE,turns in theirs. Leave law abiding ppl alone. Make PUNISHMENT for law breakers.
3990 2018-02-22 13:57:12 haha "bump stops" i read "bump stocks".  The left is getting very sloppy in its propaganda efforts lately.
3991 2018-02-22 13:57:10 @NRA are you reading this? I've been a big supporter @realDonaldTrump but you're wrong on this. We already have background checks. Enforce current law! Bump stocks? The official story on Las Vegas shooting is a joke. No one who saw those videos believed he used one.
3992 2018-02-22 13:56:43 Have the Social Security Department report those receiving SS for severe mental illness. Report the people on the terrorist watch list, establish COMMON SENSE GUN CONTROL! Take Semi-Automatics, high capacity magazines and bump stocks off the streets today! Stop taking NRA Money!

3994 2018-02-22 13:56:36 I gave up on the @NRA as a firearms owner because I can’t stomach their right wing propaganda. As a Democrat I support strong, common sfense gun laws like we have in MA. Including banning assault weapons and bump stocks.
3995 2018-02-22 13:56:32 @realDonaldTrump will you support guns at government offices, congress, whitehouse, courts, trump properties too? Make America Somalia/Yemen?

3996 2018-02-22 13:56:23 Does it mean that long stocks is a perfect strategy now?
3997 2018-02-22 13:56:19 Why didn’t Trump ban bump stocks after the Vegas shooting?
3998 2018-02-22 13:56:18 Thank you. Congress must redefine "machine gun" or once you ban bump stocks or trigger mechanisms, we will have new products doing the same thing. I.e. fire rates must be defined.
3999 2018-02-22 13:55:40 Time to buy stocks for companies who make and sell guns.  Goof ball Drump
4000 2018-02-22 13:55:40 And this would be a very BAD idea, Mr. President. Please do not attach it to good ones like background checks, raising age to 21, banning bump stocks.
4001 2018-02-22 13:55:40 @realDonaldTrump will you support guns at government offices, congress, whitehouse, courts, trump properties too? Make America Somalia/Yemen? More guns are not the answer. #GunReformNow. Ban assault weapons, high cap magazines, bump stocks. @NRA are terror lobbyists. #GunLawsNOW

4003 2018-02-22 13:54:31 Don’t end bump stocks just make it really hard to get them. Like a really stricken back ground check.
4004 2018-02-22 13:54:28 $roku has only 18 million stocks floating and out of that 6.36 million short on 1/31/2018. I expect there will be big short squeeze as this is not going down wit these type of earnings. Lets see
4005 2018-02-22 13:53:57 I agree with backgrounds and I am not apposed with the bump stocks ban but the age of purchase I see as a problem. I might add that if the FBI would have done its job this would not have happened so the bigger issue, an issue that would have prevented this is why the FBI DT Ball
4006 2018-02-22 13:53:51 We have background checks. There is no such thing as 'assault weapons'. Most gun owners know that bump stocks are a joke. A novelty item, and not a serious accessory. LOL Mental Health checks, huh? We could do that to people like you, as well. Databases are useless.
4007 2018-02-22 13:53:43 Why didn't you outlaw bump stocks after Vegas? Your budget cuts mental health programs. People need to watch what you do and not what you say.
4008 2018-02-22 13:53:07 If I were the parent of one of the victims of the recent shooting,I wouldn't be mad at the NRA or"damn,assault bump stocks!",I would be getting a lawyer & building a very good case,litigation against the FBI & local police for gross negligence.  They both knew ahead of time!
4009 2018-02-22 13:53:07 The bump stocks should have been banned immediately after the Las Vegas Massacre!
4010 2018-02-22 13:52:56 If they were sold with 30 calibre clip magazines, bump stocks, and chainsaw bayonets, they'd be everywhere in the US!
4011 2018-02-22 13:52:52 My fear is he’s only buying time until this all blows over. Just like the call to ban bump stocks after Vegas. That’s how they play this game.
4012 2018-02-22 13:52:49 Bump Stocks, Seriously? Mental Health is not the issue. Push for parents to parent their children. Become more involved in their children's lives.
4013 2018-02-22 13:52:42 Why arm and train teachers? Have a current or retired law enforcement  officers who are already adequately trained, placed in every school, raise buying age, ban assault weapons, and ban bump stocks.
4014 2018-02-22 13:52:31 There is already a ban on assault weapons. The only loop hole is “bump stock”, which is used to turn a non-assault weapon in an assault weapon, hence the latest call for banning bump stocks as well.
4015 2018-02-22 13:52:25 Bump Stocks is not the issue... people's decision to shoot up innocents is the issue. Knives and vehicles can do the same damage...
4016 2018-02-22 13:52:06 I have to believe bump stocks are not profitable to the industry or it wouldn’t allow even the talk of concessions on them.
4017 2018-02-22 13:52:05 Banning Bump Stocks is okay if you aren't military or law enforcement. Moving the age requirement is kinda a let's make liberals somewhat happy. If you can die for this country at 18 then u should be allowed to buy guns legally. Background checks being tougher is 
4018 2018-02-22 13:52:03 Vegas Concert -----  MANY armed police officers were at the concert as part of their job..... Gunman was still able to shoot 500 people, kill 58+ AMERICAN citizens.  Why?  Because of the type of guns, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.   Quit being an NRA puppet
4019 2018-02-22 13:52:02 Hey Trump Hillary supporter here, I still think your illegitimate, but if you can get bump stocks banned, raise the age to buy and have federally mandated background checks on everyone- I’ll give you credit. Seriously, I will. I’ll even say thanks. PS-leave teacher alone 
4020 2018-02-22 13:51:51 What action, no more Bump Stocks?  A bump stock did not kill 17 at Parkland. FACT-The USA owns more guns per capital than residents of any other country & gun homicide rates are 25.2 times higher in the USA! HOW ABOUT YOU START ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL?
4021 2018-02-22 13:51:37 I just hope he’s sincere about the background checks and bump stocks. I am def not a fan of his but would give him his due props if he gets this done.
4022 2018-02-22 13:51:34 The problem is... It isn't just the schools.  We all want to be safe... In movie theaters, at concerts, in churches, at work.  
Bump stocks are a start, but banning the weapons they are used on would be a better step.
4023 2018-02-22 13:51:25 @realDonaldTrump will you support guns at government offices, Congress, whitehouse, trump properties too? Make America Somalia Again? #MASA? More guns are not the answer. #GunReformNow. Ban assault weapons, high cap magazines, bump stocks. @NRA are terror lobbyists. #GunLawsNOW
4024 2018-02-22 13:51:13 Look. That’s your opinion. Nothing YOU can opine will repeal the 2nd Amendment. So better to go after the low hanging fruit issues to make change. Bump stocks are a joke. Ban them ok but will solve nothing.

We're banning assault weapons & bump stocks. We're doing universal bg checks. We're closing the boyfriend & gun show loopholes. We're studying gun violence. End of story.

Any legislator who isn't on board is out. Next.
4029 2018-02-22 13:50:42 Just make sure that the bill that bans bump stocks just bans bulb stocks and not "rate enhancing devices" that could be interpreted as anything from a trigger upgrade or lightweight bolt carrier. Just be specific.
4030 2018-02-22 13:50:42 Stop this nonsense.  BAN ALL AUTO AND SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS
4031 2018-02-22 13:50:40 Ending the sale of bump stocks is not the same as making them ILLEGAL. Thousands of bump stocks have already been sold. GTFO Ted Nugent's jock and do what the majority of the country approves and stop listening to what the minority says.
4032 2018-02-22 13:50:26 We are not taking their lies and propaganda anymore. Their lying stocks have fallen in the market and there is no hope of rebound.

4034 2018-02-22 13:50:16 Luego de proponer darles armas a los maestros para evitar masacres, dice que aumentará los controles y prohibirá los Bumps Stocks. Se contradice mientras habla, ni siquiera deja pasar un momento.
4035 2018-02-22 13:50:14 @thehill ,  Mr. Trump raising the age limit to buy guns is a start but don’t forget bump stocks go on AR-15’s.
4036 2018-02-22 13:50:10 Nasdaq is the strongest.  Keying on those stocks.  P.S. Thanks for the video and answering my question.  Much appreciated. It helped a ton!  Thank you Patrick!
4037 2018-02-22 13:50:07 Actually this kid is for the 2nd amendment. He's against mods like bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
4038 2018-02-22 13:49:59 Bump stocks are not the problem! Selective enforcement is the major problem!
4039 2018-02-22 13:49:46 I wish a Conservative group would buy out Twitter Stocks to get some Free Speech going on..
4040 2018-02-22 13:49:40 This is your only chance to see an approval rating above 40% and this isn't enough. Bump stocks were so 4 months ago and you did nothing. The topic today is military style weapons that must go away. #NeverAgain
4041 2018-02-22 13:49:39 Bump stocks today.........bullets tomorrow.......it won't stop till they get rid of all guns
4042 2018-02-22 13:49:37 I told you last week. $USDJPY won't stop going down until something breaks. Stocks and #bitcoin will suffer. #ES_F $SPY $XBTUSD $BTCUSD
4043 2018-02-22 13:49:20 You don't have your own mental health in check so good luck w/ that. You campaign was based on protecting the NRA. You say whatever the room wants to hear so no one listens to you anyway.

If you're not banning assault rifles, things won't change. Bump stocks are a given!
4044 2018-02-22 13:49:17 To their credit, Massachusetts has already passed a bill outlawing the sale, use, and possession of bump stocks. Congress is using the current distraction to pass a bill saying banks and credit bureaus don't have to tell us if they've been hacked.
4045 2018-02-22 13:49:05 I'm with banning bump stocks and barring people institionalized for mental illness from buying a gun. Just don't expect it to stop people from killing.
4046 2018-02-22 13:48:51 So you are the one who sold PNB stocks before NIRAV hit the headlines... Whattan expert
4047 2018-02-22 13:48:20 @RoyBlunt @RepSamGraves Trump says: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks  - emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21; end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!

Will you fellas be supporting all of that?
4048 2018-02-22 13:48:15 bump stocks should have been banned after vegas
4049 2018-02-22 13:48:11 Absolutely right.  The key is to change the culture. Play the long game. Don’t put all your faith and effort in chickenshit like banning bump stocks.
4050 2018-02-22 13:48:09 You can’t appease everyone dickhead!
- Guns for teachers!
- Universal background checks!
- Ban bump stocks!
Then throw it off to Congress and ‘hope’ they ‘do something’
4051 2018-02-22 13:48:08 Folks who have money in gun stocks must be giddy with glee right now. That includes a lot of government officials. I’m sure they said last night they don’t agree with arming teachers, but you know they doing the math as we speak
4052 2018-02-22 13:47:57 I love the idea that someone thinks a head office actually stocks the products the relevant firm sells
4053 2018-02-22 13:47:31 Eske j'en ai 200 dans mes stocks même ptdr
4054 2018-02-22 13:47:22 Not good. Background checks don't work, never will.  When I was a kid, we bought guns mail order.  No problem.  Bump stocks?  Good grief, one guy uses one to spray bullets wildly and you want to ban them?  You are caving to mass hysteria, city boy!
4055 2018-02-22 13:47:10 Maybe while we’re talking about arming teachers & bump stocks we should ask WHY a civilian thinks they need a military grade weapon in their home? “The law says I’m allowed and I think they’re cool” is not a good reason.
4056 2018-02-22 13:46:48 GOP and NRA, here's how you can save lives:

-Stop blocking gun violence research
-Ban bump stocks and assault weapons
-Reinstate Obama era protections
-Put human life over your membership rolls and gun manufacturer profit margins

#GunControl #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
4057 2018-02-22 13:46:45 Giving guns to trained personnel as well as strict background checks will help solve part of the problem. Threatening to Take away guns, increases it sales as seen in gun sales these past week alone. Same as rifle stocks
4058 2018-02-22 13:46:39 Tammy, please, please, please do whatever you can do, to pass laws to get rid of Assault Rifles, Bump Stocks & Multiple Bullet Clips. These items are not part of the 2nd Amendment.
4059 2018-02-22 13:45:54 I hope we have improved gun checks. No AR15/bump stocks. Starts at school where the shooter wants entry.Same entry/exit w/armed guard at door at ALL times. Pat downs, metal detectors.Bell rings;door is locked. Entry via intercom/screen &entry clearance.Any more helpful ideas??
4060 2018-02-22 13:45:52 It is almost comical to see you Americans debate the issue of gun control. 

Statistics, town halls, bump stocks, armed teachers, NRA spokespeople, corrupt politicians... It's all bullshit. 

No gun = no shooting. Simple and elegant. #BanAssaultWeapons
4061 2018-02-22 13:45:46 True, but attitude towards risk aversion & perception of what is cheap can move in cycles. On that note, I think we are finally beginning to see a "sticky" & upwards revision in the multiples of #MicroCap value #stocks. #valueinvesting is not dead. Was just asleep for a while.
4062 2018-02-22 13:45:38 Who gives a shit. It's a killing machine. Semi-automatic, assault rifles, bump stocks have no place on the streets. Nothing you can say will justify their use. Nothing!
4063 2018-02-22 13:45:30 Didn't @SenFeinstein introduce a bill banning bump stocks after Las Vegas? Why didn't Congress do anything then? Ban assault weapons.

4065 2018-02-22 13:45:05 When you’ve saved enough to have at least a 6 month cushion. Invest in small or large cap stocks, mutual funds, forex, crypto whatever you have the most knowledge in.
4066 2018-02-22 13:45:04 @ChrisCuomo Do you believe @realDonaldTrump is headed in the right direction with these proposed changes to gun laws (ban bump stocks, increase age, more intensive BG checks)? What is going to be the tipping point for majority acceptance?
4067 2018-02-22 13:44:46 @RoyBlunt #NRA talking points are false.  the 2nd amendment rt to bear arms does NOT extend to assault rifles and bump stocks. #gunreformnow
4068 2018-02-22 13:44:36 I'm with you on most of this, but have you seen some of the videos of these kids with bump stocks, this is not a joke. It turn that AR full auto and needs to be regulated is all I'm saying. Bann nothing! Secure our schools with armed guards and let teachers carry.
4069 2018-02-22 13:44:08 Haha I only use Twitter  However I'm being 100% serious, this is news I wanted to hear. Obama did absolutely nothing and all these idiots are praising his post-presidential take on the matter. Whereas Trump is banning bump stocks & increasing school security to prevent attacks!
4070 2018-02-22 13:44:05 End sale of bump stocks, good, but how about some regulation on magazine size? Raising the age to 21 great, but YOU know the NRA won't go for that, major loss in sales, can't lose too much $ on any deals, congress won't like to be threatened that their NRA $ will be cut off!
4071 2018-02-22 13:44:00 Did Trump see the reaction to this gun toting teacher proposal by the victims and their families? Very little raised their hands. Do your job and get guns out of immature young kid's hands. Up age to own a gun. Stricter background checks. No bump stocks.
4072 2018-02-22 13:43:53 The black president is gone (I still have my guns) Hillary isn't president (I still have my guns). Easy enough to watch the stocks before Obama was elected throughout the past 10 years
4073 2018-02-22 13:43:39 @foxandfriends Please consider a compromise of national Concealed Carry reciprocity in exchange for eliminating bump-stocks and high capacity magazines (above 10 rounds) in rifles shooting calibers above .22 LR. Thanks, John T.
4074 2018-02-22 13:43:36 The founding fathers of this country defeated a tyrant with muskets, not semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks. Your liberty to defend your life extends no further than yourself and it does not, and has not ever, superseded the rights of others to live.
4075 2018-02-22 13:43:26 Remember IBM, GM, Standard Oil.... there is a time and a season with stocks.
4076 2018-02-22 13:42:56 What we as gun owners don’t understand is it takes less then 15 minutes to modify a rifle from semi auto to full auto just by filing down a pin, bump stocks is the legal version but if you make that illegal we mine as well just file the pin lol...
4077 2018-02-22 13:42:47 Do your research, bump stocks do not make a weapon automatic and are not simple to use... giving crumbs to the whiners at the expense of our 2nd amendment rights is wrong... #2ndAmendment #Constitution
4078 2018-02-22 13:42:46 Well, it's a start. Barely, 
Pretty easy to go after "Bump Stocks" what took so long?
#BanAssaultWeapons #NeverAgain #TrumpLiesMatter
4079 2018-02-22 13:42:34 Gotta ready to Rumble! Get Er' Done a lonnnng day ahead. Starbuck stocks run here I come.
4080 2018-02-22 13:42:30 Why werent bump stocks banned after Vegas? Have bump stocks been used in any school shootings?
4081 2018-02-22 13:42:29 I absolutely agree! changing age restrictions on rifles or banning certain rifles and bump stocks would NOT however help the situation at all!!!
4082 2018-02-22 13:42:25 If you are going to ban bump stocks...add it to a bill to ban abortion. See who really wants to protect our 'kids'.
4083 2018-02-22 13:42:17 On behalf of our pro 2A community, we think this is a horrible idea, where’s the due process, do the research on bump stocks, it’s a slippery slope you are giving the left. Also raising the age requirements is a constitutional issue..
4084 2018-02-22 13:42:15 I get background checks on long guns as well as pistols. I get banning bump stocks. I don't agree with raising age. Actually enforcing gun laws already in place with out pleading down would help a lot. IMHO.
4085 2018-02-22 13:42:10 Automatic weapons are already banned.  Also, from experience, bump stocks suck.  they are unreliable.  Its easier to use your thumb and belt loop, with more consistent results.
4086 2018-02-22 13:42:10 And was conceptualised when the US had no standing army, and "arms" meant muzzle loading flintlocks, not automatic assault rifles with bump stocks.
4087 2018-02-22 13:41:59 Bump stocks? We're still talking about bump stocks? That was months ago! When you reach the age of 21 you aren't nuts anymore? And when exactly can you know when a person is about to go postal? This isn't good enough. The people will dictate to you what is good enough. Got it ?
4088 2018-02-22 13:41:58 End bump stocks bruhh fuckin younger knes gotta ruin everything....
4089 2018-02-22 13:41:46 Hi Tom, so what’s your exit with these types of buys...assuming MKH scores and gets star player . Do you sell the next morning ..encouraged to follow your tips though unsure if I will be left with lots of stocks/players I might not be able to sell
4090 2018-02-22 13:41:46 and end sale of Bump Stocks!...”
4091 2018-02-22 13:41:27 The only work around I see are bump-stocks of which the NRA publicly supported restricting after Las Vegas. (FTR, I'm no fan of the NRA these days)
4092 2018-02-22 13:41:24 Loved you up till now.  Leave bump stocks alone - no more gun regulations no more gun control.  That won't solve anything and just opens the door for the Government to take away our liberties.  NO!
4093 2018-02-22 13:41:23 Very good, and deserves credit as a good start. We need more specifics on exactly what this means, will you close the gun show loophole? Will you resend the law that allows people adjudicated unfit to buy weapons? Will you ban bump stocks or just end the sales, it's a difference.
4094 2018-02-22 13:41:20 A ban on bump stocks has nothing to do with the 17 dead in Parkland. Assault rifles are used to kill people or target practice.  People do not need them. Arming teachers is lunacy unless there is a zombie apocalypse.
#TrumpColluded #FBR #FBResistance
4095 2018-02-22 13:41:19 Hate me if you want- but if we get anything from trump for gun control I’ll take it. Ban of bump stocks, raise age, mandatory background checks? Do it Trump. Get it done. I don’t have high hopes it’ll happen, but I’ll take it. PS- Leave teachers alone.

4099 2018-02-22 13:40:59 The NRA representative at Town Hall said "The NRA has already taken a stance against bump stocks. We did that prior to Trump saying he will look into it." So we can deduce that you & all the  Congressional Cowards wait for your cues from NRA before speaking or voting. COWARDS!
4100 2018-02-22 13:40:58 will you support guns at government offices, Congress, whitehouse, trump properties too? Make America Somalia Again? #MASA? More guns are not the answer. #GunReformNow. Ban assault weapons, high cap magazines, bump stocks. @NRA are terror lobbyists. #GunLawsNOW #gunsafety #NRA.
4101 2018-02-22 13:40:50 Bump stocks save lives. Because people that buy them become worse shots than they were before. They are just a novelty item. Not worth the trouble and expense of legislation.
4102 2018-02-22 13:40:33 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4103 2018-02-22 13:40:27 They have always advocated for some sort of reform eg Comprehensive Background checks, Ban of Bump stocks. The age limit thing may be where the problem will be.
4104 2018-02-22 13:40:27 @marcorubio Would it be too much to ask...Support the ban of Bump Stocks,   support closing the loopholes in background checks, raise the age limit to purchase an assault rifle...do our children's lives matter ?
4105 2018-02-22 13:40:24 Not if it means NRA money will be effected, you won't do much. You need to enact much stronger Gun restrictions. Look to the other countries as to their restrictions. Americans love their guns...bumping up age, bump stocks sales, and mental health checks isn't the answer.
4106 2018-02-22 13:40:21 Think of 3/24 as a dealine to 1.) Ban bump stocks 2.) Ban the 200 guns Mr. Nelson mentioned 3.) Fix background checks 4.) Raise the age to 21. These kids shouldn't be the ones having to fight. I'll be calling every Republican member because the kids plans shouldn't be necessary

4108 2018-02-22 13:39:56 Yep, bump stocks will make all the difference. Not. But hey, here's a cup of water to put on a bonfire! Dip.

But I'm impressed Rubio showed up. And he certainly speaks better than you do - almost refreshing to hear complete sentences. You're too cowardly to even be on audio.
4109 2018-02-22 13:39:52 Teachers should not be armed. Ban assault weapons. Vote out anyone who takes money from the NRA. Ban bump stocks. Enhance background checks along with better mental health care. This is the solution.
4110 2018-02-22 13:39:43 You just attack him for doing nothing in bump stocks now you say it would do nothing. Fact the matter 2 of the 4 he had were purchased illegally. 2nd so called assault weapon ban is useless. How many of these attacks as an AR been used? It’s not the gun!!!!
4111 2018-02-22 13:39:39 ה-NRA, גם אם הוא לא מכריז על זה, כן מתנגד לבדיקות רקע וגם למכירת Bump Stocks. העניין הוא שזה שהוא אומר שהוא תומך בזה שווה כקליפת השום, כי תוך שנייה הוא מתהפך ועובר לצד מחוקקי ה-NRA, בדיוק כמו ב-DACA. בנוסף, זה ממש בפריפריה של הדיון על הגבלת הנשק.
4112 2018-02-22 13:39:33 You have to ban all assault weapons not just bump stocks which was not used in the school shooting!
4113 2018-02-22 13:39:27 @DLoesch can you please clarify this ; does the NRA support the ban on bump stocks? Thanks
4114 2018-02-22 13:39:15 Thank you for your patient listening.  Many of us are counting on your courage to take immediate actions to protect our children from a long list of choices heretofore muted by $$ from NRA to our elected officials.  This must go FAR beyond banning bump stocks.
4115 2018-02-22 13:39:13 Futures Flat as Markets Eye Yields $UDOW $SPY $TQQQ #markets #stocks #Bonds #Trading #Yields #trade #trader #Trading #invest #USA
4116 2018-02-22 13:38:56 The NRA has opposed EVERY proposed gun measure in the last 15 years. Including expanded background checks which more than 90% of Americans favor. Including outlawing bump stocks. Everything. The audience rightly wasn’t letting this domestic terrorist organization off the hook.
4117 2018-02-22 13:38:37 There are no assault weapons in the US except on military & police grounds, fully automatic guns were banned long ago for sale to the public. Bump stocks use for what, fun maybe, but after 60 sec. the gun is so hot you cant hold on to it so need lot of extras like in Vegas
4118 2018-02-22 13:38:29 We are not settling for demanding Assault weapons be banned and you offering 'i support banning bump stocks' the NRA must go!
4119 2018-02-22 13:38:26 Gun Manufacturers stocks are up
4120 2018-02-22 13:38:26 Bump stocks should have been illegal a long time ago since fully automatic weapons are illegal!  Christ, the fucking idiocy of this administration and "president" is astounding.  Pound sand, DOTARD.
4121 2018-02-22 13:38:20 At KQ_Apparel we say you can get yourself one of these at only 49 dollars excluding shipping costs . Get yours now while stocks last. Support excellent craftsmanship.
4122 2018-02-22 13:37:39 Again, Full auto is not banned, it is regulated, you can get a licence to own a full auto weapon. Bump stocks make a weapon act as if it is  full auto. Trump put bump sticks in the full auto category. Yes you can make one, but don't get caught!
4123 2018-02-22 13:37:35 Guess you didn’t see trumps tweet about comprehensive background. Mental checks and ban on bump stocks then, huh? 
4124 2018-02-22 13:37:29 There are many stocks that have gone up as much as the one's you mentioned. They just don't have the same weights in the index.
4125 2018-02-22 13:37:08 Assault weapon ban ! Bump Stocks should already have been done. We're not settling for bullshit anymore. Assault weapons ban ,background checks from border to border no matter how you purchase,limit rounds capability, do not get rid of gun-free-zones NO we're not arming teachers
4126 2018-02-22 13:37:05 Bump stocks do not convert a weapon to automatic.  Converting to automatic is already illegal. Outlawing bump stock will lead to outlawing all semi automatics. Don’t let the uninformed and subversive get away with that.
4127 2018-02-22 13:37:00 And how would armed teachers have prevented the shooting in Vegas? Hmmm? I can tell you how a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks would have helped. #GunControl
4128 2018-02-22 13:36:47 All you’ve done is offer thoughts and prayers. Vegas happened 4 months ago, now you’re talking about bump stocks. You’ve cut all programs that could have cut back on these shootings. Now that you realize these kids will be voting you’re acting. Acting as in faking concern.
4129 2018-02-22 13:36:46 Bump stocks are not the problem. That is blaming the equipment, the gun, the ammo, the trigger mechanism, etc. Enabling people is the right answer. The attack stops when the right people show up with the firearms, so let them come to work.
4130 2018-02-22 13:36:40 Why did it take 17 more murders, before we heard another word about Bump stocks
4131 2018-02-22 13:36:37 I don’t buy ETFs. I only buy individual stocks of companies that I like & use their products on sale. I don’t short & I don’t trade options. I am a plain vanilla investor
4132 2018-02-22 13:35:59 Attach a legal bump stock you can buy at Walmart like the shooter did in Vegas and you have an AR-15 that shoots 600 rounds a minute. First step: Ban bump stocks. Second step: Ban all automatic weapons.
4133 2018-02-22 13:35:58 Ban Assault weapons now.  The ban on the sale of bump stocks supposedly was to happen after Vegas, but as usual went nowhere after NRA spread money around. Our children are the future, we must protect them to ensure tomorrow. #BanAssaultWeapons NOW. #OurChildrenWillRise
4134 2018-02-22 13:35:49 Nice try. But you talked about Bump stocks after the Vegas shooting. Some may be fooled by your “action” to change but I see right through the bs. Do just enough to placate citizens while not stepping on NRA toes 
4135 2018-02-22 13:35:42 Just in case anyone thinks age limits and waiting periods are going to stop shootings, the Las Vegas killer was 64 years old, planned carefully, then killed 58 and injured 851. But we could have prevented him from amassing an arsenal and using bump stocks for a high rate of fire.
4136 2018-02-22 13:35:41 Mr. President, killing terrorists does not stop airplane highjacking, securing aircraft does.  Raising gun purchase age, eliminating bump-stocks, treat mental health, does not stop school killing, securing schools NOW will.  Get political later.
4137 2018-02-22 13:35:39 I can live without bump stocks. Total waste of ammo. Any gun ban is a pipe dream and won’t work
4138 2018-02-22 13:35:29 Bump stocks aren’t needed man.
4139 2018-02-22 13:35:26 How many people died in Vegas because of bump stocks?!
4140 2018-02-22 13:35:24 Trump ending sale of bump stocks like the niggas killing ppl are professionals lol. Bitch.... I NEED MINE 
4141 2018-02-22 13:35:21 So your going to put people out of work that manufacture these stocks?
4142 2018-02-22 13:35:20 I'm ok with the mental health checks and bump stocks(they anyways), but we must not raise the age to buy a gun. It will do nothing but steal Americans freedom.
4143 2018-02-22 13:35:15 The answer to the issue is to ban military style and grade weapons. Increase background checks. Ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines and associated paraphernalia.
4144 2018-02-22 13:35:10 NRA doesn't care about bump stocks. It's a Assault Weapon issue not a mental health issue. Don't settle.
4145 2018-02-22 13:34:37 banning bump stocks is fine they where designed to get around the law anyways
4146 2018-02-22 13:34:32 Bump stocks, get rid of them. Change the age from 18 to 21 for gun purchases. Add increased scrutiny to weed out attempted purchases by people suffering mental illness. All, YES, but while you are at it increase scrutiny on illegal aliens and voter ID's too.
4147 2018-02-22 13:34:13 "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!" says President Trump. #9newsmornings #9news
4148 2018-02-22 13:34:08 #Breaking : #GunControl #PresidentTrump announces he is pushing for comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health while raising the age to 21 - and end the sale of bump stocks.

4150 2018-02-22 13:34:01 Except USS has already for the past 2 yrs moved from stocks to bonds hence realising their self fulfilling prophecy of too small returns. With 100% DC the risk of stock performance is 100% on the individual. How's this fair?
4151 2018-02-22 13:33:59 @realDonaldTrump President Trump, Please consider a compromise of national Concealed Carry reciprocity in exchange for eliminating bump-stocks and high capacity magazines (above 10 rounds) in rifles shooting calibers above .22 LR.

4153 2018-02-22 13:33:58 I WILL BE STRONGLY PUSHING COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MENTAL HEALTH. RAISE AGE TO 21 AND END SALE OF BUMP STOCKS! C
4154 2018-02-22 13:33:57 @MikeBellafiore Hey Mike, do you know where we can find resources about scalping stocks ? Books, blogs, stock selection, patterns...
 Thank you (y)
4155 2018-02-22 13:33:43 I completely disagree. there was only 3000 units and they manipulating it as many numbers as they can. Coz I tried and tested it and it is not less than 3 min it is 3 seconds only. stop #fooling us. I know u do a great job for making RN5pro but time to think #stocks
4156 2018-02-22 13:33:40 That is a start, raising the age to buy an assault weapon. Not good enough. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. Law enforcement agrees. Military agree. The NRA and the 30 million they gave you. It will stop you and your party to do nothing. Bump stocks you should have banned a year ago.
4157 2018-02-22 13:33:25 Bump stocks could be moved to a class 3 tax stamp
4158 2018-02-22 13:33:20 Mental health yes, bumper stocks?  Age. 21 maybe, Remember don't just pass a law or regulation to take away the rights of law abiding people.
4159 2018-02-22 13:33:09 What are Bump Stocks?
4160 2018-02-22 13:33:05 No bump stocks? Back round checks, denying citizens there Hod given right to guns? That’s how it starts, Trumps coming for your guns. And you thought it would be Obama.
4161 2018-02-22 13:33:03 Why don't bump stocks scare me?
Because if they can own one I can own one,that's tactical equality.The second I'm not allowed to own one it puts me at a tactical disadvantage as I'm a law abiding citizen bound by rules.Criminals aren't by their very definition, they are criminals
4162 2018-02-22 13:32:54 Would it not be apt to quote " what may happen ......" instead of "WHAT WILL... "

4163 2018-02-22 13:32:50 Raise gun age to 21. Have armed officers and officials. in every school. Increase mental health and background screening. Ban bump stocks that can convert an AR-15 into an automatic weapon. Done.
4164 2018-02-22 13:32:50 Leave bump stocks and guns alone.  It opens the door to more bans.  It's all about mental health.
4165 2018-02-22 13:32:39 Bump stocks are not the issue, AR-15's are the issue. Bump Stocks only help the AR-15 a slight bit. And way to throw Congress under the bus. This could easily just be solved by you with an executive order and yet you don't want to sign them unless it's got to do with Obama.
4166 2018-02-22 13:32:39 Part 2: However, this is among the most volatile stocks I've ever seen. My position is small. Manage your risk, knowing that the price moves can take your breath away.
4167 2018-02-22 13:32:33 I'm ok with mental health checks, and bump stocks are toys.  The age restriction is arbitrary.
4168 2018-02-22 13:32:31 Eliminating bump stocks?  God, what a bold, courageous stand.

4170 2018-02-22 13:32:20 He has over 3 million reasons why he votes against assault weapon ban; against restricting sale of bump stocks, against any common sense gun laws...
4171 2018-02-22 13:32:11 Legislation I would support. Decrease in magazine size, banning of bump stocks or any modification that makes a weapon behave like full auto. Increase age to 21 to own a firearm.
4172 2018-02-22 13:32:01 Just lip service. Trump already repealed Obama's legislation that made it hard for mentally ill to get guns & his new budget proposes big cuts to the funding needed for background checks. Refused to deal w/bump stocks after LV. Past actions speak more than this tweet. SAD
4173 2018-02-22 13:31:24 This is a good start no one needs bump stocks or military Assault weapons except the military.
4174 2018-02-22 13:31:22 Why the hell would you buy "weed stocks" oh my god capitalism is so weird
4175 2018-02-22 13:31:21 “Buy stocks that go up; if they don't go up, don't buy them.” -Will Rogers. 

When I had read this first time, thought of it as a witty funny comment by Will Rogers. After understanding momentum investing a bit, this makes all the sense!
4176 2018-02-22 13:31:01 Banning bump stocks won’t stop anything. Everything else fine. But don’t start with our 2nd amendment.
4177 2018-02-22 13:31:00 Trump tweet: "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"

Do you believe Congress will act on #GunReformNow?
4178 2018-02-22 13:30:33 Definitely need enhanced background checks.Bans on military assault weapons and bump stocks are a must.Also, limitations on ammo magazine size.Good start.Then, fund a special commission to research the causes and consequences of gun violence and next steps recommendations.

4180 2018-02-22 13:30:29 Bump stocks have been used in what? One shooting? Maybe two?  But suddenly, that's a "big step?"  Seriously, @morning_joe?  Have we mentioned lately how much you motherfuckers hurt America?
4181 2018-02-22 13:30:21 Wake Up Congess!

@realDonaldTrump "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"
4182 2018-02-22 13:30:18 Bump stocks wasn't used in the Florida shooting. Ban assault rifles!!
4183 2018-02-22 13:30:17 1) yes you need to close loopholes in background checks 2) the NRA came out with a statement  today opposing the age restriction . Can you oppose them? 3) bump stocks are a terrible idea in general and do need to go... But are not really a part of most of the shootings .
4184 2018-02-22 13:30:16 Why are you now just tweeting about banning bump stocks? Why weren’t strongly pushing to have them banned after over 50 people were killed by the in Las Vegas??? Bump stocks weren’t used in this shooting. How about banning assault rifles?

4186 2018-02-22 13:30:14 If an 18 year old can serve in the military they should be able to buy a gun at that age. Comprehensive background checks and ending sale of bump stocks is a start but Congress will do the absolute minimum bc they're owned by the NRA, and then you'll throw them under the bus.
4187 2018-02-22 13:30:02 The weapon used in that concert was not an assault weapon, by definition. Maybe by you're own personal definition,  but not everyone elses. It was a legally modified rifle. Again, I don't think bump stocks (they still don't make a rifle fully automatic) should be legal.

4193 2018-02-22 13:28:31 Trump, since when do you actually support banning bump stocks? Why, you didn’t even say the words after the Las Vegas massacre. As for both background check coordination—no kidding, always needed. Mental health, however, is NOT the problem. GUNS and extremist 1700 viewpoints ARE!
4194 2018-02-22 13:28:28 How many died in Las Vegas because of bump stocks? Or does that not count any more?
4195 2018-02-22 13:28:24 You wrong it would have, 
he wouldn't be 21, the mental health issues would have prevented the sale and bump stocks would not be available to the public. In essence he would have to by a gun illegally, then go after the schools. But with armed "guards" he would be put down.
4196 2018-02-22 13:28:02 I don’t know about bump stocks...
4197 2018-02-22 13:27:58 Agree with the ends of Bump Stocks and the Raise to 21.President Trump 
4198 2018-02-22 13:27:55 Age & bump stocks OK......but, we ALL deserve a "fighting chance" if fired upon.  Let guns on campus...."a fighting chance" at least.  #MAGA
4199 2018-02-22 13:27:54 Bump Stocks is soooooooooooooo FIVE MONTHS AGO!!!!! You  just  don’t  GET IT!!! 

SMH.

Leave our White House. PLEASE. Go. Go and NEVER return.
4200 2018-02-22 13:27:48 I actual agree on banning bump stocks, but to say Rubio was wrong is downright silly. The statement he issued was and is correct. In this case, it would have done nothing. You have to admit this.
4201 2018-02-22 13:27:44 I was a Million Mom march; it seemed that we had little impact. I turned 80 and thought I might retire. But now, two years later, the mother of 4 and the grandmother of 8, I find that it is time to march again. It is time to reinstate the ban on automatic rifles and bump stocks.
4202 2018-02-22 13:27:43 Like it or not tougher reform and bans are coming. Just like the bump stocks. So you better make all the love you can and use them for dick measuring as much as possible. Cause it's coming and if you don't abide you'll get to go to the prison  you guys love so much

4204 2018-02-22 13:27:42 Bump stocks are not the problem, the amount of ammo. you can fire in 30 seconds is. It is not in a teachers job description to learn gun safety and carry unless they want to, I would, but know many who definitely would not.

4206 2018-02-22 13:27:28 Faux?  How about CNN's scripted Q's they gave the kids?  & What did you want Trump to do, spend the night in the room?  You also conveniently forgot Bump Stocks & mental health - there's more than 1 approach to this than knee-jerk, "ban guns".  Zombies.
4207 2018-02-22 13:27:17 BREAKING: President Trump tweets he will be pushing for "Comprehensive Background Checks" with emphasis on mental health, raising age to purchase a rifle to 21, and "end sale of bump stocks." #WCCB #News
4208 2018-02-22 13:27:07 I wonder about weak teachers who just loose it ? Why not just 1 entrance with security and metal detectors Why are bump stocks in the conversation?
Cruse didn’t have one?
Gun laws in this is Country are nuts at 18 we can buy a simi auto killing Machine ! NRA suck
4209 2018-02-22 13:27:05 Armed teachers would’ve made all the difference in the world a long time ago. Raising the age limit, banning bump stocks will do nothing except embolden gun grabbers
4210 2018-02-22 13:26:51 The bump stocks is nonsense .  There were multiple shooters Las Vegas and parkland - fire sessions and start to Hang communists Dems  in deep state

An investment that I have held and added since the relist.

Funnily enough it's my highest conviction trade of 2018 yet it has yet to make it's huge move up while other stocks I have held have super bagged since.

Patience game. I believe it's close.
4212 2018-02-22 13:26:43 Really??  So you're FOR unregulated sale of bump stocks?
4213 2018-02-22 13:26:40 Comprehensive NATIONAL background checks, no loop holes. All assault weapons not just bump stocks. Revisit  your executive order that eliminates safe guards implemented to limit access to individuals with mental health issues. #RealGunControl
4214 2018-02-22 13:26:39 Adults at age 18 can fight n die for our Country and should not have their rights infringed.
Build better data bases for background checks
BAN BUMP STOCKS
REPEAL HIPAA so Doctor's can tell cops about their mentally ill patients 
Open Federal CCP'S that can't be State restricted
4215 2018-02-22 13:26:35 Bump Stocks aside, if you can go into the military at age 17, then you should be able to purchase a firearm at that age as well
4216 2018-02-22 13:26:33 So let's examine why they last three minutes...high capacity military style weapons.  At least, you can look to Massachusetts, the only state to ban bump stocks. 
So the answer you are proposing is more guns, more militarization of the country?
4217 2018-02-22 13:26:18 Need a better definition on comprehensive. Also as long as bump stocks are regulated same as fully automatic weapons I’m OK and 21 restriction is only for semi automatic weapons. Also need to grandfather in those under 21 now that own These
4218 2018-02-22 13:26:17 Again... Stop asking for something that isn't going to happen in the near future... Trump is calling for improved background checks and banning bump stocks... Embrace that and work to get those things implemented. Screaming that isn't enough is a waste of time right now
4219 2018-02-22 13:26:15 listen this man completely disgusts my soul  like really.. stocks.. why not take action now
4220 2018-02-22 13:26:13 YOUR the one that signed the bill making it easier for people with mental health issues to get gun's already. All your #LapDogs after Las Vegas told us that banning bump stocks was the 1st sign of taking away the 2nd amendment right?  So which is it ?
4221 2018-02-22 13:26:11 He actually tweeted after talking about more serious background checks and looking at mental health and banning bump stocks.. That is the step in the right direction.
4222 2018-02-22 13:26:07 Bump stocks are a joke. I agree on the background check. But up to 21 is ridiculous.
4223 2018-02-22 13:26:07 We already have background checks. Bump stocks were never proven to have been used in Vegas, weren't used in Florida, and are not practical whatsoever. I can simulate a bump stock by putting a rifle on my hip and bouncing the trigger.
4224 2018-02-22 13:26:04 Want us to review any particular stocks or forex tips service or trading systems? Let us know!
4225 2018-02-22 13:26:02 1. So you rolled back the Obama-era mental health limitations just to reinstate them?

2. Why weren’t the bump stocks banned after Vegas?
4226 2018-02-22 13:26:01 If by change he raises age limits to 21 and bans bump stocks by the time it is Midterms, it means only one things... cos the Democrats aint going to have anything to run on
4227 2018-02-22 13:26:01 Like I said! 

“I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!” Donald J Trump
4228 2018-02-22 13:25:53 I disagree w the bump stocks! I understand wanting to do something but at the same time I don't believe you should give in to everything they want especially because it's not the guns that kill!!! Teachers should be armed and should be part of negotiations!!
4229 2018-02-22 13:25:41 Why am I getting notification after notification of my stocks touching 52 week low? Isn’t our economy doing well?
4230 2018-02-22 13:25:40 Start with your own family and no moron, not just bump stocks, ALL SEMI OR FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. THAT’S THE ONLY ANSWER THAT’S ACCEPTABLE.
4231 2018-02-22 13:25:23 God, can you imagine if he actually meant this, instead of some incredibly disingenuous and bad-faith effort that he can claim is “comprehensive”?  Bump stocks is such a gimme.

Digital registration database.  CDC authorized to study gun issues.  The NRA would howl in protest.
4232 2018-02-22 13:25:15 Disappointed on the President's position on bump stocks? I sure am, in 24 minutes he went from commonsense to libby gun control talk. What the hell? 
4233 2018-02-22 13:25:13 Marco, Could we consider a reasonable compromise of national Concealed Carry reciprocity in exchange for eliminating bump-stocks and high capacity magazines (above 10 rounds) in rifles shooting calibers above .22 LR.  #MarcoRubio
4234 2018-02-22 13:25:09 O had a filibuster proof majority for months. ARs are still legal. Bump stocks too. But its trumps fault? Wtf? Tds impaires your logic.
4235 2018-02-22 13:25:06 @realDonaldTrump MR. President getting rid of bump-stocks is not the answer. Great u want to arm teachers but how about ex military with Honorable Discharge and retired cops? Already trained and willing!!!
4236 2018-02-22 13:25:00 Sir, please bring more stocks. The customer is not getting the product.... please please................ I want To buy Redmi Note 5 Pro........
4237 2018-02-22 13:24:53 better yet how about you outlaw the Bump Stocks and Components. you out law Assault weapons, up the age to 21,  and more help with mental illness Assault weapons are not needed for hunting we are not at war with each other.
4238 2018-02-22 13:24:49 Stocks edge higher after previous decline amid rate hike fears.
4239 2018-02-22 13:24:48 Close all Gun show loop holes
Ban all assault style weapons
Ban bump stocks
Fire arms and lethal means restraining order 
More mental health prevention and treatment services available in our communities
4240 2018-02-22 13:24:42 Stop WMDs on our streets..Ban the sale of assault weapons now. Ban hi capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. There is no need for these in our public society and no place for those who would use them outside of the military. We are not yet civilized enough.
4241 2018-02-22 13:24:34 Mr. President We Are With You On SupportingMore ComprehensiveBackgroundChecks & Elimination Of Bumper Stocks!This Mass Shooting Would NotHave Occured As Well As Other MassSchool Shootings Without TheWeapon AR 15 Assasult Rifle! You NeedTo Ban This Weapon & Get It Off The Streets!
4242 2018-02-22 13:24:29 Stop stigmatizing #MentalHealth. @NRA won't let you push to #BanAssaultWeapons? Bump stocks or no bump stocks, military grade weapons have no business in civilian hands.
4243 2018-02-22 13:24:21 Pres. Trump just tweeted he will support banning bump stocks and raising the gun purchasing age to 21.

So let me understand this ... An 18-yr old can drive, vote, and be sent to war (WITH GUNS), but can't exercise his #2A right in his own nation? Absurd.
4244 2018-02-22 13:24:18 Ban assault weapons! Bump stocks haven’t been killing kids, AR15’s have. Get rid of weapons of war! They’re offensive weapons designed to kill the maximum number of people within a small amount of time. While you’re at it, ban extended clips.
4245 2018-02-22 13:24:14 Your budget takes $$ from background checks. Where do you intend to get the $$ to fund this?  Do you EVER think though details before you blurt out?  YES to background checks, age limit, and ban bump stocks, but you need a plan to pay for it.  Maybe take back some from the rich?!
4246 2018-02-22 13:24:10 Why bump stocks??  The kid didnt use one
4247 2018-02-22 13:24:08 Can't your son teach you that you don't have to capitalize certain words, old man? Like "Comprehensive Background Checks" or "Mental Health" or "Bump Stocks"? Oh and the NRA will remind you very soon who you answer to.
4248 2018-02-22 13:23:54 Yes bump stocks became legal during @BarackObama Admin #EndGunFreeZones
4249 2018-02-22 13:23:49 You're right I do, 2nd amendment says I can have a gun not the NRA, the supreme court says I can, Obama's ATF ok'd bump stocks. FBI dropped the ball, please show me you have a brain and link the NRA to this or any shooting
4250 2018-02-22 13:23:48 Bump stocks for all. Problem solved?
4251 2018-02-22 13:23:43 I agree with that! Except the end of bump stocks!! There is no reason why good Americans can't own them and if we give up bump stocks then that's the first step for the gun grabbers to reach in and start tearing apart our 2nd Amendment! When will the the BS end? It's not the guns
4252 2018-02-22 13:23:33 You might as well get rid of rubber bands then bc they can sub for bump stocks.
4253 2018-02-22 13:23:25 NBS butuan is so nkakainis walang stocks palagi
4254 2018-02-22 13:23:23 Good idea
Make sales-clerks into mental health professionals / psychiatrists, RIGHT AFTER
you make teachers into police / marksmen

OR get rid of the stupid assault-type weaponry (not just bump stocks)
4255 2018-02-22 13:23:21 I’m with you, but easy on the emotion.  It accomplished nothing.  Informed well thought out arguments do.  And understanding the issue and the immense challenges either wing’s proposed solutions is paramount.  That said, why would you need to ban bump stocks AND assault rifles?
4256 2018-02-22 13:23:12 These shooters will not be deterred by armed teachers we will now just have bullets flying in both directions. Possibly hitting students fleeing the shooter. Ban the assault type weapon. Ban the high capacity clips. Ban bump stocks. Stronger background checks and waiting period.
4257 2018-02-22 13:23:11 But can they buy bump stocks to make their guns shoot faster?
4258 2018-02-22 13:23:04 Banning bump stocks, while it should happen, it is largely pointless. Full auto is illegal, so anything that makes a weapon full auto should be illegal. But the issue is dangerous people buying assault weapons. That's where we should start.
4259 2018-02-22 13:22:40 Trump's incoherent rant about arming teachers came around there at the end on raising the purchase age, background checks, and bump stocks. It's like someone else took over his account with rational thought.
4260 2018-02-22 13:22:38 Correctly done background checks a must. Call in the remaining ATF Directors and get their ideas. Pull ideas from NON-NICS states to learn how to correctly do checks. Raise age to 21. Give bump stocks to ATFE, Class 3. GOP paid off by NRA. No support available.
4261 2018-02-22 13:22:34 God alive, @suladoyle, he’s ended the sale of Bump Stocks, what more can you possibly want?

4264 2018-02-22 13:22:18 Bump stocks isn't enough. No law abiding citizen needs access to a killing machine such as an assault rifle. What is it for? Hunting deer? Target practice? Luckily the future looks brighter than ever thanks to the children who stand against the NRA.
4265 2018-02-22 13:22:09 No it does not need to be that extreme. There is some common sense & logic involved. It’s very simple, like all of these children are telling you. Outlaw AR’s period. Outlaw bump stocks period, and make it infinitely harder for anyone to purchase a gun. Period. Results will come
4266 2018-02-22 13:22:04 What does “Bump Stocks” mean?
4267 2018-02-22 13:21:59 A double would be the same like March 1994 - Bond Crash & Orange County went bust
And a lot of buying opportunities in stocks afterwards!
4268 2018-02-22 13:21:47 These kids are right to be suspicious of you and Congress.  Weren't we banning bump stocks after Las Vegas? That didn't happen.  You think this will go away with the next news cycle -likely started by something you did or will do.  But it will not.  These kids aren't going away.
4269 2018-02-22 13:21:37 Concentrate on mental health and nothing else. Bump stocks do not convert a rifle to automatic. So an 18yo can join the military take up arms and die for his country but you won’t allow them to purchase arms to defend himself and his family.
4270 2018-02-22 13:21:22 If you raise the age to 21 to own firearms, then you need to raise the age to 21 to enter the military. Banning #bump stocks is #infringement. You PROMISED to support the #2A!!! That school shooter did not even use a bump stock.
4271 2018-02-22 13:21:05 So bump stocks are ok too own ?
4272 2018-02-22 13:21:03 "In a mood" what the hell kind of statement is this? Yes backgroud checks, yes to no bump stocks, yes to age 21. No to guns in schools.
4273 2018-02-22 13:20:56 All the "solutions" you are parroting, including bump stocks, will not effect the NRA's bottom line, that is the sale and  proliferation of guns. They are just using the Second Amendment to make money, the end all of Repuppetcan policy.
4274 2018-02-22 13:20:55 And as the debate rolls on, sales of assault weapons and bump stocks go through the roof in fear of people losing access. The @NRA wins again. Sigh.
4275 2018-02-22 13:20:41 Agree with everything but bump stocks. You can do the same thing they do with a rubber band or belt loop. Is essentially a meaningless ban on an accessory.
4276 2018-02-22 13:20:19 Are you going to close the private sale loophole? Expand NICS? Do you even know what that is? Fine, ban bump stocks, that's a gimme thing to do. Raising the age to 21 doesn't really matter either, but whatever. You really need to ban the sale of military grade rifles.
4277 2018-02-22 13:20:16 Buy stocks in stuff you own or buy stuff from stocks you own?
4278 2018-02-22 13:20:13 The signs were all there. When a company adds "blockchain" to their name and the stock increases 100 fold, it is very questionable. We have seen this movie before and it had a bad ending #stocks #traders #trading #bitcoin #Blockchain #ThursdayThoughts #cryptocurrency @EconGlobal
4279 2018-02-22 13:20:01 Neither background checks nor bump stocks bans would’ve stopped Cruz From murdering 17 people. He passed the background check. Banning assault rifles like the AR15 would’ve stopped him. #GunControl
4280 2018-02-22 13:19:59 The Las Vegas shooter was older than 21, how does an age limit on bump stocks help?
4281 2018-02-22 13:19:58 Do you agree with the #POTUS?

RT: @realDonaldTrump "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!"
4282 2018-02-22 13:19:53 You should have taken care of bump stocks over a 1 ago after the Vegas u should have neva touched Obama's mental Hill Bill banning guns which u will most likely reenact & take credit for & yeah you wanna rasie buying age don't toot ur horn u need 2 get rid those guns & loopholes
4283 2018-02-22 13:19:52 This logic is unbelievable.  Ban bump stocks but leave AR 15 weapons in play.  Wtf
4284 2018-02-22 13:19:49 Background checks, fine. Mental health focus, good. Bump stocks, great. None of that addresses the law enforcement failure to act when repeatedly warned. The Florida shooting was preventable with existing measures if the authorities were held accountable to do their job.
4285 2018-02-22 13:19:37 Banning bump stocks, raising age to 21, and doing background checks does nothing!

BAN ANY TYPE OF ASSAULT RIFLE! 

Simply require any new or modified weapon to be subject to approval by the feds!
4286 2018-02-22 13:19:36 @realDonaldTrump Love you, Mr. President! Keep pushing the 'Wall' and get these MS-13 guys out of here. Also, agree with your 'age' issue on guns as well as the 'bump stocks.' Armed security at 'all' schools. MAGA!
4287 2018-02-22 13:19:33 Pres Obama issued an exec order tightening background checks for those w/ mental illness & YOU RESCINDED IT a year ago, remember? Why do u act like you want to help when you've done the OPPOSITE?
And bump stocks? The one thing that the NRA does not oppose doing? How brave of you.
4288 2018-02-22 13:19:23 I disagree. I do appreciate your comments on bump stocks, however
4289 2018-02-22 13:19:10 Remembering the time is NOT good enough - go against the NRA BAN assault rifles , bump stocks & have much stricter gun laws, background checks & control the number of guns a qualifying person is allowed to own- Do not let SHAME ON YOU -  be you unless the NRA bought you.
4290 2018-02-22 13:19:02 Literally does nothing after Vegas...

does nothing

4291 2018-02-22 13:19:01 Bump stocks were several mass shooting ago.  I will not rest until their is a ban on semi-automatic weapons, period.
4292 2018-02-22 13:18:59 We have background checks. If you’re going to raise the age to 21- then what about our military members? Ending bump stocks is just a call to let them take something else.

4295 2018-02-22 13:18:47 Conversation about bump stocks began after the #LasVegasShooting, you’ve done nothing since then Trump!
4296 2018-02-22 13:18:42 Im a little disappointed Mr. President. I thought you understood the phrase "shall not be infringed". I agree bump stocks are not necessary, however all the do is increase the rate of fire bot the accuracy. Someone could do more damage with 30 well placed rounds than 30 sprayed.
4297 2018-02-22 13:18:37 It could be a deterrent if kids know they can be confronted. It would not be the only solution, but one piece. Background checks, waiting periods, outlaw bump stocks, a teacher or two armed.
4298 2018-02-22 13:18:34 Bump stocks won't make your small penis any bigger........
4299 2018-02-22 13:18:28 If you’re confident this will solve the problem why add the other shit like raising the purchasing age and doing away with bump stocks?
4300 2018-02-22 13:18:27 I wish companies PROVED the stupendous numbers they claim to have sold....

This whole crap of artificial demand creation while stocks rot in warehouses is going beyond limits.

4317 2018-02-22 13:18:00 It makes me sick to read stuff coming from people like you. Every liberal was crying for the banning of bump stocks after vegas. 99% of them probably didn't even know what a bump stocks was. Now it's potentially going to get banned and you complain some more.

4319 2018-02-22 13:17:53 You know damn well your NRA teet-sucking Repugnicans are not going to go for any of this.  If you really cared, you would issue one of your fave “executive orders” and simply outlaw the public possession of assault rifles!  Like “bump stocks” are even an issue.

4320 2018-02-22 13:17:49 Why are we waiting four and a half months to ban bump-stocks?  You didn't suggest it after Vegas.  Why now?  Why aren't you pushing a ban on assault rifles?

4325 2018-02-22 13:17:34 What do age and bump stocks have to do with background checks and mental health?

4359 2018-02-22 13:16:48 Raising the age of firearm ownership to 21 while being able to be drafted and serve in the US Military at 18 is backwards.

Either raise the age of military service or leave the firearm ownership age alone.

4385 2018-02-22 13:16:01 Banning bump stocks. Raising age-limits to purchase AR15s. Strengthening background checks.

4386 2018-02-22 13:16:00 This just in, bump stocks deemed perfectly acceptable since they caused no deaths in the latest mass shooting. Nice logic, phag

4388 2018-02-22 13:15:54 Iceland and Norway dont seem to have problems with their fish stocks or who fishes their waters - whys that then
4389 2018-02-22 13:15:49 DON'T push it, make it happen. And getting rid of bump stocks doesn't solve the AR problem.
4390 2018-02-22 13:15:48 So you keep your money from the NRA... 30 million, and offer this poor offering of raising the age limit to 21 and banning bump stocks?  So you basically did nothing.... AGAIN!!!

4392 2018-02-22 13:15:45 IDGAF AR-15, AR-57 mods, extended mags, bump stocks, hollow points, and other weapons/ammo like that have got to go. We can not let civilians have those things anymore.

4394 2018-02-22 13:15:44 Good start. Then ban bump stocks. And require hazard insurance on all firearms. And require all semi-automatic weapons to be stored on secure facilities. Just for starters. Bless your heart.
4395 2018-02-22 13:15:44 Good start!!
Ban bump stocks
 Adopt recommendations in NRA white paper- fund all actions
4396 2018-02-22 13:15:42 No, actually there haven't. Last night's townhall is a perfect example why. Rubio offers a ban on bump stocks, limiting magazine sizes, raising the legal age for purchasing firearms, and strengthening background checks. The response from the crowd? Ban all semi-automatic weapons.

4399 2018-02-22 13:15:38 Please ask Mr. POTUS, to give an explanation why he can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”- Thank you!
4400 2018-02-22 13:15:38 Bump stocks are start but the weapons can be modified in many other ways. Google it. We need to remove & eliminate any chance of this type or any type of mass shooting ever again.
4401 2018-02-22 13:15:37 Banning bump stocks is useless. You can make one yourself with a belt. I agree with your other ideas though.

4406 2018-02-22 13:15:10 Kinda doubt they have assault weapons with bump stocks but ya never know. Overkill seems to be a thing!
4407 2018-02-22 13:15:09 But don't teachers need bump stocks to be effective?
4408 2018-02-22 13:15:04 You guys were literally crying for a ban on bump stocks after Vegas.
4409 2018-02-22 13:15:02 The NRA supports banning bump stocks, and it’s incredibly difficult to convert a semiautomatic, to fully automatic.
4410 2018-02-22 13:15:01 You're a few mass murders behind.  Bump stocks was Vegas.
4411 2018-02-22 13:15:01 What about the suicidal shooters who fully expect to die there? What about the SWAT team that comes in looking for the active shooter and finds a bunch of people (teachers) with guns? Start with the bump stocks and age levels, move on to AR-15s, impose background checks. DO IT!
4412 2018-02-22 13:14:55 Just bump stocks? No law abiding citizen should have access to an assault rifle.

4417 2018-02-22 13:14:30 The hell with bump stocks, ban assault rifles

4419 2018-02-22 13:14:22 Are the teachers going to wear holsters?  Get real.
Who's going to want that responsibility of making sure that mentally ill students don't steal the gun. Who would make sure a criminal doesn't steal the gun. 

Automatic rifles,  bump stocks shouldn't be available for sale

4423 2018-02-22 13:14:19 You are correct Bishop! He is a coward. We need to ban accessories for the AR, high capacity mags(which are banned in most states for hunting), bump stocks, trigger kits(its illegal to install them but not to own them) and raise the age to 21, along w/ BG checks 4 private sales.

4443 2018-02-22 13:13:11 No citizen needs an assault rifle. Stop the bump stocks. Limit ammo. Most 2A people/hunters would be unaffected.
4444 2018-02-22 13:12:49 Dem's never wanted to solve school shootings...They would lose their best fund raising issue...I bet most of them own stocks in gun/ammo companies. It's also their go to vote-for-me talking point when elections are near. Dem's don't fix problems, they create them.
4445 2018-02-22 13:12:06 Bump stocks....
4446 2018-02-22 13:11:54 Good idea, but let's focus on bump stocks, which wasn't even used in this shooting.
4447 2018-02-22 13:11:30 Historically rising interest rates do not keep stocks from rising!!! #markets
4448 2018-02-22 13:10:47 Go read his tweets for the number if people who agree and like him. Get your facts straight in the majority.  Enjoy your increase in pension fund through rising stocks and tax return. Just a tip of accomplishments already.
4449 2018-02-22 13:10:28 Oh, Donny Dotard...You are out of touch. Arming teachers is not the answer. Raising the age limit for all weapons to 21, ban on bump stocks/semi automatic weapons, and a 1 year waiting period for any weapon are options, but you and the Republicans wont give up NRA $.
4450 2018-02-22 13:10:06 You’re moving the goal posts. First we shouldn’t ban bump stocks because you can just “make your own” now we shouldn’t because they’re constitutionally protected? We’ve already banned civilian use of automatic weapons. How are bump stocks different? Why are you protecting them?
4451 2018-02-22 13:09:43 Then why the knee jerk reaction on bump stocks
4452 2018-02-22 13:09:36 Got it part 1 of multi part solution.  Also:
Ban bump stocks!
Require states to register offenders withNICS
4453 2018-02-22 13:09:32 They’ll outlaw bump stocks.  Mayyyyyybe do something w/ background checks.
4454 2018-02-22 13:09:12 Why are then moving to ban bump stocks? If more guns is the answer surely the teachers are going to need more fire power, how about misuse  launchers?
4455 2018-02-22 13:09:08 Congress writes and passes laws, not the DOJ or the president. The president cannot ban anything without Congress. Bump stocks weren't even used in Parkland, as far as I understand. A small, small drop in an ocean.

4457 2018-02-22 13:08:43 Banning bump stocks on guns will not solve the gun issue.
4458 2018-02-22 13:08:37 That's a much better idea. But what I don't understand, Mr. President, is your proposal to ban bump stocks for semi auto rifles.

That's not how the second amendment works Donald.
4459 2018-02-22 13:08:00 Hes already given survivors a voice. That's more than anyone else has done. He has already done something about bump stocks. He's also for raising age to purchase guns, better background checks. It's up to Congress now to do the right thing. So, yr tweet is wrong.
4460 2018-02-22 13:07:36 Now lets face the gun problem head on.  Bump stocks should have been tackled after Las Vegas so you are a bit late.  Make up for your lateness by outlawing sales of AR 15 to privste individuals
4461 2018-02-22 13:07:27 Trumps master plan to address school shootings 1) Talk about banning bump stocks 2) Arm teachers 3) Arm kids 4) leave office

4464 2018-02-22 13:06:15 Tell me again what Obama did after Sandy Hook?Oh he allowed bump stocks. You're a partisan clown.
4465 2018-02-22 13:06:14 what are your views on bump stocks on AR-15 or even a handgun?
4466 2018-02-22 13:05:56 More guns is not the answer. Ban assault weapons, ban high capacity weapons, bump stocks, tighten background checks. That is what is needed.
4467 2018-02-22 13:05:46 SIBC news: The Scottish fisheries secretary Fergus Ewing has agreed to meet the Shetland Fishermen's Association.   A paper produced by the association called A Catching Policy for Scotland sets out policy proposals to reduce discards and to improve the management of fish stocks.
4468 2018-02-22 13:05:41 Bits & pieces. Kids totally overplayed their hand. Weren't interested in a debate or a compromise, all they wanted to hear was "We're banning all semi-automatic weapons and blacklisting the NRA".. Goodluck. Im on their side regarding bump stocks, but they're starting to annoy me.
4469 2018-02-22 13:05:20 Locally the market in #India is recovering as the old duty stocks are almost committed. This should help the domestic prices to come up and we can see some more demand again for the month of April and May. 
#Oil #sunflower
4470 2018-02-22 13:05:12 So now that we’ve cleared up that fact that you do want to give them guns. Are you giving teachers AK-15s with bump stocks? What’s your weapon of choice?
4471 2018-02-22 13:04:55 US eqty poll: FAANG, FANG+ SPX tech stocks will continue to outperform SPX over the next 1mth - true or false?
4472 2018-02-22 13:04:54 That was fast.  

After Las Vegas, NRA blamed bump stocks on Obama.  Said they should be banned.  When legislation was written, they opposed it. :/  But nobody was looking. The time period of outrage had passed.
4473 2018-02-22 13:04:27 If I were there, I would have said so many things, like why are you, Donald, telling the GOP to pass the bills in Congress that would outlaw bump stocks.
4474 2018-02-22 13:04:12 My relatives-Sim card is not currently functioning. Its stocks are the source factor of collapse. டப்பா நெட்வொர்க்?
4475 2018-02-22 13:03:47 Right?  Seriously. He looked/acted as though he was drugged. Let’s see if he and the Republicans really DO anything -  like banning assault rifles and bump stocks. I doubt it.
4476 2018-02-22 13:03:44 I see that point. Texting, and watching stocks, used to eat up hours out of my time every day, but look at what's happened to the farming industry...
4477 2018-02-22 13:03:42 We all need to put the NRA in there place and give the right ansher on should it be harder to obtain semi-automatic and modifications like the bump stocks now if they say there on the American peoples side prove it and stop playing games or give the us all the run- a- round.
4478 2018-02-22 13:03:38 Banning the sale of assault riffles and bump stocks would be a better first step.
4479 2018-02-22 13:03:27 @Pro8mm I may get a Kodak XL55 Super 8mm do are any of your film stocks comparable? Thanks

4481 2018-02-22 13:02:55 Stocks are holding lower – but off their worst levels of the session – with the release of a more hawkish than expected set of policy meeting minutes in the US and a weak reading on German business confidence offsetting upbeat corporate updates.
4482 2018-02-22 13:02:49 To do more than talk... he talked about banning bump stocks after they sold out following the mass shooting in Vegas. He's still "talking about it". Btw, in what country is the best commercial for a bump stock a bloody mass shooting? Really US? Really???
4483 2018-02-22 13:02:43 Land is more fun to own than stocks. There’s a reason it’s called “real” estate. When you own land, you have the foundation to dream, plan and build your new home when the time is right. Plus, buying acreage gives you much more space, than crowded city lots. #TheHavenKonzaOpenDay
4484 2018-02-22 13:02:39 Ok ban them all. And they become rare. More valuable. More desirable. The market for them opens opportunities to make serious cash selling guns/bump stocks. The problem increases. Studies show small % of gun crimes are committed with a legally purchased gun. Not that easy to fix
4485 2018-02-22 13:02:38 Record high stocks of copper in land-locked Arizona and Utah are a reflection of soaring transport costs in the United States and weak demand for the industrial metal produced in the Americas, copper industry sources say.
4486 2018-02-22 13:02:11 Mes amis auteurs ! Comment organisez-vous vos séances de dédicaces ? (Prospection, stocks...)
4487 2018-02-22 13:01:56 Ban semi autos, bump stocks, and high cap mags. People can manufacture high cap. Mags and bump stocks. Making semi autos is much harder.
4488 2018-02-22 13:01:45 im 18 now, thots!! i just bought STOCKS
4489 2018-02-22 13:00:47 Or at the very least, armed security. Schools are the perfect stage for a psychopath who desires the least resistance. That won’t change if we outlaw bump-stocks and leave it there.

4496 2018-02-22 12:58:51 From my research, most gun owners don't care about bump stocks at all.
4497 2018-02-22 12:58:32 I should've said he open to an unbiased discussion. He's open to an unbiased agenda by showing that he is open to banning bump stocks and looking into stricter laws...
4498 2018-02-22 12:58:26 No they wouldn't stop listening to the $30m the @NRA gave you for your campaign. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks... That is a partial solution
4499 2018-02-22 12:58:17 He already banned bump stocks...?

4502 2018-02-22 12:58:06 Skip bitcoin its a chinese scam.  Go for stocks and better investments in that have backing to it. It's illegal in NY to use it in NYC . banks won't take it
4503 2018-02-22 12:58:06 I am going to speak to the Justice Department about banning bump stocks even though they have no jurisdiction over that.

4504 2018-02-22 12:57:31 Stocks reverse off lows as traders frantically 
try to interpret Trumps latest tweets.
4505 2018-02-22 12:57:02 Of course the NRA does not want to raise the age limit for gun purchases. 

The more mass shootings that happen, the more their stocks and sales go up.
4506 2018-02-22 12:56:52 Be even better if you banned auto and semi auto weapons and bump stocks
4507 2018-02-22 12:56:52 We can simultaneously discuss all the “bans” like bump stocks large capacity clips etc. I would prefer everything be discussed.
4508 2018-02-22 12:56:51 Head @realDonaldTrump says arm teachers. NO. Ban assault weapons & ability to buy & build from on line, armor piercing bullets, high capacity clips, bump stocks, & straw purchases at gun shows. Hunters stand up & join this fight or the pendulum may swing. 

#NeverAgain
4509 2018-02-22 12:56:28 having done a lot with the gun stocks I can say always sounds the same. Each time this occurs hundreds of thousands of new-to-guns buyers come in & the millions of current stockpilers add more. Given stunning current weapon build capacity in US (plus imports) cannot be shortage.
4510 2018-02-22 12:56:19 >Bump stocks are a start.
Aaaand this is why gun owners oppose any god damn thing you people want to do. At least most of them are smarter than you and don't outright admit you're after them all.
>Background checks to prohibit domestic abusers
Already do. Form 4473 will be denied
4511 2018-02-22 12:56:15 AGRI NEWS NET at this hour- Plastic bags don't biodegrade, they photodegrade –  The international trade in fresh fruit increased - World Corn Ending Stocks.- ICE raw sugar prices saw a rebound in - Die media in Suid Afrika -- this and much more coming up
4512 2018-02-22 12:56:14 He has proposed solutions multiple solutions in the past days. He recently put out a piece about 2 days ago proposing about 5 or 6 things we should do and said it on his show. He also said yesterday he doesn’t mind a ban on bump stocks. So very wrong on your part
4513 2018-02-22 12:55:58 @marcorubio @SenBillNelson @RosLehtinen Look at UK, Australia, Japan; Failure of past does not have to mean same now! Doing nothing is weak,Complicit & bought!People can have all the guns they “think” they need, just not Assault weapons or bumps stocks! Have Real Courage, BAN NOW
4514 2018-02-22 12:55:49 3) this isn’t the sole solution.  Ban bump stocks. Good 1st step.
4515 2018-02-22 12:55:03 Last night you indicated opposition to arming teachers, and support for raising age to own a rifle, banning bump stocks, & limiting high-capacities.Please spend your political energy getting those ideas passed instead of defending yourself for things you’re being criticized for.
4516 2018-02-22 12:54:54 @bpshow Solution to school violence is not more guns. Ban AR-15 + bump stocks.
4517 2018-02-22 12:54:46 Pelosi was involved in that ‘stock market after hours’ scam/corruption that many other legislators participated in a few years back, and made big bucks. They were able to trade stocks after the 4 PM closing time, when they knew the winners - like “past posting” at the racetrack
4518 2018-02-22 12:54:44 Loose, flawed background checks, allowing mentally unstable to purchase guns, the ability to aquire automatic weapons, 'bump stocks'.......THIS "is a magnet for BAD people"
4519 2018-02-22 12:54:27 Bump stocks were what people wanted banned after the Vegas shooting. You are right it had nothing to do with Florida just like the College in Texas being evacuated yesterday had nothing to do with a gun. What is your idea to stop this because banning items isn't working.
4520 2018-02-22 12:54:25 Bump stocks
4521 2018-02-22 12:54:24 LIE Lies, = Liar!!!!!!! they don't support Bump Stocks, this makes you look stupid to write such things
4522 2018-02-22 12:54:18 Come on! There has to be compromise Marco. No bump stocks and assault weapons.
4523 2018-02-22 12:54:06 Trump: ban bump stocks

Slide fire CEO: the chocolate cake at Mar a Lago is excellent

Trump: I have decided to reconsider my position on this issue
4524 2018-02-22 12:54:02 When I was REALLY trading, we'd put in an order with multiple brackets to buy/sell/short about 500 different stocks well above and below the market, based on recent daily ranges. I'd decide which brackets to blast in 1 min. before open. That would work great with biotechs, BUT...
4525 2018-02-22 12:53:55 Of course Red flags should be followed, but they would not have been as necessary if semi/fully automatic & bump stocks were not available. The world's watching horrified by the #NRA & those who take #NRABloodMoney & how they embrace gun culture. #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
4526 2018-02-22 12:53:50 I’ve said tough guys who bash these kids & call for teachers to be armed would be shitting their pants if they were in the same situation. The potus now acting on bump stocks is 2 little 2 late. Ban assault weapons and high capacity mags.
4527 2018-02-22 12:53:40 Yes, he will propose a useless 'arming teachers" bills and ban bump stocks (which the NRA had already decided to sacrifice. BS.
4528 2018-02-22 12:53:35 Ok, I’ll play. I support the 2nd amendment. I also support responsible gun control, banning bump stocks, background checks, mental health & wellness identification restrictions for starters. How about you?
4529 2018-02-22 12:53:25 I stipulated tight quarters because what you gain in capacity and rapid fire you lose in accuracy. I believe all guns are weapons and should be registered and owners licensed annually including private sales. Bump stocks and mods to convert to fully auto banned completely.
4530 2018-02-22 12:52:32 Let's start with the fact that for even highly trained police officers 4 out of 5 bullets miss their targets.  And most shootings don't take place in schools.  All current proposals--bump stocks, minimum age, arming teachers--are shams, distractions from the real problem.
4531 2018-02-22 12:52:08 At the present moment, do you own any stocks or bonds?
4532 2018-02-22 12:51:42 Trump asks "Why do we need bump stocks?" I ask; Why US Gov @Bundy Trial dismissed case BEFORE TRUTH of Attemped MASS MURDER of 3000 GOT OUT?
4533 2018-02-22 12:51:04 We can't let Democrats melt on the vine with the pittance of "bump stocks" and background checks. NOTHING SHORT OF REINSTATING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN IS ACCEPTABLE!

4536 2018-02-22 12:50:12 @nextofficial Hiya. Can you tell me what size range your Stafford store stocks up to please?
4537 2018-02-22 12:49:48 When there will be similar crisis like 2008 there will be many opportunities to buy cheap stuff (stocks, Gold, BTC too) very very low. But not anytime soon.
4538 2018-02-22 12:49:45 Get rid of the  guns that use the bump stocks or the high capacity clips , there are over 200 such assault weapons available in America to gun manufactures build assault weapons in Florida and get tax incentives to do so,a Trump campaign promise to get rid of citizens united !LIE
4539 2018-02-22 12:49:26 I'm not in favor of bump stocks but I am in favor of correct explanations.  Bump stocks increase the rate at which most semi automatic guns can shoot bullets, it does not turn them into automatic weapons.  Why are many in the media saying the opposite?
4540 2018-02-22 12:49:25 There is no one credible who thinks this is a good idea.  Further, with more than 300 million guns in circulation in America & the vast vast majority of shootings not in schools, not involving mental illness, not involving bump stocks...none of your ideas would have any effect.
4541 2018-02-22 12:49:02 Standing on the antiquated 2nd amendment when it comes to military grade weapons of mass destruction/ammo/bump stocks is getting OLD!
4542 2018-02-22 12:49:01 @wjrradio @SteveCourtney66  Courtne is ymaking people's heads spin with his hyper talk regarding the Florida Shooting n falling for rheteric.  Solution is Single Point Entry to Schools with Security similar to airports, elimination of Gun Stocks n enhanced background checks.
4543 2018-02-22 12:48:41 Remove all shares from derivatives segment except the Nifty stocks and probably Nifty Junior or NSE 200.
4544 2018-02-22 12:48:35 Total BS. I’ve found your charting to be very spot on most of the time. Charting stocks is far easier than the extreme volatility in crypto.
4545 2018-02-22 12:48:26 Even real gun owners know "Bump Fire Stocks" are a joke. And yeah, I don't hide behind some pictures I got off google. I guess I expect too much of punks. How do we get Ellis off this now? He's getting too many already, I'm sure.
4546 2018-02-22 12:48:03 "The NRA - which contributed an estimated $30m (£21m) to help elect Mr Trump - opposes a total ban on bump stocks but supports some regulation of the devices and some changes to background check legislation." #President #Trump #fundedbyhate #BanMachineGuns #BanAssaultWeapons
4547 2018-02-22 12:47:47 Oh yeah for sure!! Im glad the banning of bump stocks is finally taking place. He’s also talking about arming the teachers, rather than talking about banning ARs. Which should be like the last resort since we are trying to bring less guns into the world and schools, not more.
4548 2018-02-22 12:47:45 The @GOP are Never going to regulate guns the NRA loves the fact that our schools have become hunting grounds no different than some f'd up 3rd would country. If you can't regulate guns, regulate magazines, bump stocks, and other things you can control!
4549 2018-02-22 12:47:44 So I asked this girl where she stocks her handbags. Mo gurl straight up told me she will only tell me if I pay her for the information. That's why they say bo darkie do not support each other. Sies
4550 2018-02-22 12:47:28 And while we are it. Are the bump stocks banned since the previous shooting?
4551 2018-02-22 12:46:44 Well to me there is no way banning semi automatics is realistically possible in the states even if I did agree with you but banning things like bump stocks is probably going to happen soon since Vegas. Also families being empowered to take firearms away from dangerous individuals
4552 2018-02-22 12:46:38 Yeah I'm definitely thinking same way - trying to stick with Quality Stocks that are Winning for me and not dreaming up silly reasons to sell them.
4553 2018-02-22 12:46:33 @tonykatz @93wibc  what is the reaction at CPAC to Trump pivoting on #2a to ban bump stocks? Hardcore gun community is losing their mind.
4554 2018-02-22 12:46:19 Do you know how many Dems have stocks investments in ammunition companies? Call them out! They don't get money from NRA but from GUN INDUSTRY! Get informed!
4555 2018-02-22 12:46:14 I support the ban on bump-stocks as does the President. I also support banning the sale of semi-automatic rifles to anyone under the age of 21.
4556 2018-02-22 12:45:47 So are they going to be carrying assault rifles too, with bump stocks, because I don't think a hand gun is a fair fight, are you wanting to militarize our public school system.  No thanks.  #GunReformNow
4557 2018-02-22 12:45:33 Bene, li que o Trump estava propondo a regulamentação ou a proibição dos bump stocks, Qual sua posição em relação a esses "transformadores"?
4558 2018-02-22 12:45:28 Trump asks "Why do we need bump stocks?" I ask; Why did AG Sessions send US Atty Attack Dogs on Patriots of Bunkerville/Malheur?
4559 2018-02-22 12:45:15 Trump will do nothing but put band aids where stitches are needed, people will be buying Assault weapons like crazy for fear that they will be illegal again and  tougher laws to by guns may affect their ability to purchase one, bump stocks will solve nothing, a big smoke screen
4560 2018-02-22 12:45:04 Making changes to so-called "bump stocks" and ramping up background checks. Right moves by @POTUS in the wake of #FloridaSchoolShooting? Gun law expert Emily Taylor is next @USLawShield @1320WILS
4561 2018-02-22 12:44:44 You almost had me for a second with banning bump stocks and better background checks. Shoulda known better.
4562 2018-02-22 12:44:41 I’ve always wondered what the distinction is that defines what is ok for a civilian to own, ie if 2A was written for muskets but AR-15’s with bump stocks are ok, why not allow civilians to own miniguns & rocket propelled grenades? Need them for hunting, right?
4563 2018-02-22 12:44:10 A teacher's responsibility is to educate and not physically defend.  Continuing Education and certification is needed to sell stocks, real estate, mortgages, etc.  Why not continually certify mental stability to maintain ownership of weapons after a background check to acquire?
4564 2018-02-22 12:43:52 and of course the unions don't have a few MP's in their pockets & then of course we have UNITE who haven't paid any tax in 2011 and 2012, despite owning £51.6 million of stocks and shares. If the tories had announced what Corbyn just did it would be called censorship. Hypocrites.
4565 2018-02-22 12:43:30 Lmao I like the stink bids, just always wondered who has been putting those .01 bids on half the  stocks for many years now.
4566 2018-02-22 12:43:25 The Dems submitted legislation to ban bump stocks as far back as April 2013 (Feinstein)  the GOP blocked it then as they did after the recent Vegas shooting. Watch what they do (or fail to do) not what they say.
4567 2018-02-22 12:43:17 The NRA and gun advocates will not compromise on bump stocks. The solution can't be banning any "thing", bc once you concede that a thing can be the problem, you concede that a gun can be the problem.

Watch them shift to "mental health" and background checks that target people.
4568 2018-02-22 12:43:03 Then quit being a pawn of the NRA and push for better background checks, a ten day waiting period, outlawing bump stocks, prohibit gun sales to people with a mental illness and provide more funding(not less) for mental health programs. Also, don’t give guns to teachers.
4569 2018-02-22 12:42:52 Bump stocks ban age restriction harder background checks are good but only an armed person on the scene can really be reliable to stop a shooter.There is no other way to be safe and that’s the safest you can get
4570 2018-02-22 12:42:50 Proud owner of medical Marijuana Stocks. the more people smoke the more money i make? drop your local dealers and visit a dispensery and help grow my stock and make me money #weed #money
4571 2018-02-22 12:42:28 What about the Vegas Shooter?  He purchased guns and bump stocks legally, had no criminal record or mental instability noted.  I'm just asking. Not taking any sides.  It just seems to me that ordinary citizens are more armed than the basic police forces charged with protection.
4572 2018-02-22 12:42:07 Remember when Obama's DOJ and ATF determine bump stocks, high capacity mags were illegal and that 18-21 yr old could not own firearms? YEAH... I don't recall that either!!!
4573 2018-02-22 12:42:05 Fyi,ar-15 fires only as fast as the shoot can pull the trigger. Just like any other fire arm, pistol, shot gun, etc. bump stocks, as used in Vegas, uses the recoil of gun and shooters finger pull trigger fast. There is no practical need for that!
4574 2018-02-22 12:41:53 @efCuomo Trump wants to ban bump stocks. But they ( the stocks ) don't kill. The weapon kills not the stock. All these stocks do is convert semi-automatic, to automatic. Never the less the weapon kills. So ban the weapons. 
 By the way, pistols are no match against assault weapon
4575 2018-02-22 12:41:42 Even Conservative hero Scalia asserted that there were limitations on what kinds of guns people were entitled to.

If modification devices like bump stocks can turn basically ANY semiautomatic rifle into an automatic, then ban them.
4576 2018-02-22 12:41:39 High capacity magazines are for killers. Bump stocks are for killers. Silencers are for killers. Assault rifles are for killers. All need to be banned. #gunsense #FloridaSchoolShooting #GunLawsNOW #GunReformNow #GunContolNow
4577 2018-02-22 12:41:22 Saw a vid on the newer AR...who needs bump stocks with this. Just a bullet change produces massive carnage. Even bullets for close range.
4578 2018-02-22 12:41:02 I think it was very political. Both Dems&Reps get money groom gun industry. Many Dems have stocks in ammunition companies. They all eat from the same hand they spit on. Kids were used to push a 1 way narrative. Dems use tragedy to get votes. Pretty disgusting!
4579 2018-02-22 12:40:50 Yeah I thought the kick #HSBA got was a bit unnecessary - although the 'Experts' were whinging that they missed Targets. Suffering today like most Stocks though.

4581 2018-02-22 12:40:49 Dont tweet. Lead. Lets address magazine capacity, universal background checks (gun show, gift, private sale loopholes), bump stocks and related technologies, raising age on gun purchases to 21, required training, stronger integration of data, #CommonSenseGunLaws! #StudentsStandUp
4582 2018-02-22 12:40:15 They don't arm people. They give safety classes and teach responsible ownership. States with requirements like Conn, use them to certify those they allow to habe them. They actually have said they don't care about bump stocks. It's not about PC, you already lost most people
4583 2018-02-22 12:39:56 Makes no sense to compromise on anything when the Left is this histrionic about guns. 

Don't budge on bump stocks or anything. The Left will never, ever be satisfied. #ThursdayThoughts
4584 2018-02-22 12:39:49 Do it now as prices are skyrocketing! Same with bump stocks!
4585 2018-02-22 12:38:59 WHAT WAS SAID: We want common sense regulations (assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, mental-health restrictions, age requirement). 
WHAT YOU HEARD: They're going to take all our guns, melt them down, and build a machine to make everyone gay. #NeverAgain
4586 2018-02-22 12:38:57 Oh here comes another CNBS bozo are u gonna tell ppl to now to buy stocks like AA, INTC, instead of the greatest companies like BA, AMZN u ppl have no common sense
4587 2018-02-22 12:38:42 Just stop tweeting.  Teachers are educators not Swat officers.  #neveragain AR-15 assault weapons should be banned as well as bump stocks
4588 2018-02-22 12:37:05 The bake sale is still going, so come down and get your treats before stocks run out!
4589 2018-02-22 12:36:59 actually they've said they wanted bump stocks to be banned...many times

4591 2018-02-22 12:36:42 the NRA is not going to budge on any of these issues
they didn't ever budge on bump stocks
4592 2018-02-22 12:36:03 I think you are out of touch.  Bump stocks and automatic rifles should not be available to the public. Period. The $3million you've taken from the NRA is clouding your judgement
4593 2018-02-22 12:35:46 Wow! She's a baby in this picture! You certainly knew what you were talking about! How about stocks? 
4594 2018-02-22 12:35:46 facts > feelings
banning bump stocks is just plain stupid and will only lead to eventually banning any enhancement on rifles.
It’s as if everyone for gun control (who doesn’t know firearms) want us to only have muskets.
4595 2018-02-22 12:35:38 You are such a dipsh%t, ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks immediately, that is what you should be saying.
4596 2018-02-22 12:35:19 There's a group of SHS students sa likod ko kanina and na-amaze ako kasi they're talking about stocks. May potential pala talaga hahaha

Is your calculation correct ? Is it 30000 or 300000 ?
I think it is your marketing strategy without a huge amount of stocks. So, stop fooling people. First mentain ample stock then go for sale.

4600 2018-02-22 12:33:13 Well I guess the issue is politicized now, and still no one has suggested talking to the Israelis about their system, amazing, an obviously great system and we are talking about outlawing bump stocks....
4601 2018-02-22 12:32:59 Hey @SageDynamics can you find any stats on the number of folks killed by bump stocks? I honestly think Vegas may be the only time anyone has ever been felony murdered with one.
4602 2018-02-22 12:32:54 I heard exactly what you said president Trump.. and you didn't say armed the teachers with guns.. at this point I would probably put the brakes on it because it don't matter what you do or say to try to work with the other side just work with the NRA ban the bump stocks
4603 2018-02-22 12:32:50 Assault rifles are not a complicated issue.  Bump stocks are not complicated.  Background checks are not complicated.  Stop enabling an absurd and pathetic argument for weapons of war to be so accessible.  Stay focused.  #MorningJoe
4604 2018-02-22 12:32:41 Your theatrics wont work. If you are actually a high school kid show me your birth certificate and voter registration card. Why arent you so allegedly pissed at HUSSEINS for legalizing Bump Stocks?
4605 2018-02-22 12:32:17 I have listened to the experts who say that when law enforcement arrives to an active shooter situation, they will take out anyone they see with a gun. Dumb Trump idea!!! Ban assault rifles & bump stocks, raise age to 21, mental health & background checks. Don't be dumb!
4606 2018-02-22 12:31:44 Bad example- crack is illegal, but junkies get it anyway. Just as criminals will get guns either way. Either through illegal trade or a 3D printer, criminals don't care about laws, that's why they are criminals. Outlaw Bump Stocks and auto assault weapons- Not all guns, bad idea.
4607 2018-02-22 12:31:28 He always puts the attention towards him. Just like the stocks. Stocks are going down because he gave good news. what an idiot
4608 2018-02-22 12:30:56 guess what, people opposing new laws enacted like the GOP wants to do to get background checks better and outlaw bump stocks makes it more likely more school shootings will occur.
4609 2018-02-22 12:30:53 I hope you got their message.  No more bump stocks or automatic guns.
4610 2018-02-22 12:30:16 Ban bump stocks now. Ban assault weapons now. Keep shotguns for hunting and only people with a clean mental bill of health gets ONE. Simple. Who the fluck is this NRA to even have a say in this??  #GovernmentStandUp #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #SCHOOLSHOOTINGS #GOAWAYNRA
4611 2018-02-22 12:30:09 Grabe ang stocks

4613 2018-02-22 12:28:43 And after Vegas .... did they ban bump stocks? Nope not a damn thing. They did nothing but wait for it to fade from the news. @GOP are worthless for the people. They are only for the money $$$

4615 2018-02-22 12:28:06 Common use is an unworkable and ridiculous standard. Alternatively, we can reinstate the stocks and public lashings as criminal punishments, as they were at one time not "unusual" (the relevant standard under the 8th amendment).
4616 2018-02-22 12:28:03 But bump stocks won't do that.

4618 2018-02-22 12:27:45 I think if you have armed officers in schools..it will deter people from going 2 a school & cause havoc.  Also don’t we have enough background checks as it is? & last time I checked bum stocks r illegal in Mass.This guy did not use a bum stock & the fbi dropped the ball on this 1
4619 2018-02-22 12:27:35 Trump asks "Why do we need bump stocks?" I ask; Why does FBI,DHS,ATF,DOJ need WACO & RUBY RIDGE?
4620 2018-02-22 12:27:30 I've been wondering why the first responders has been brought to the camera's and ask would they feel safer with an assault weapons ban.let help these people do their job in safety.police not having to worry about bump stocks on assault weapons would be a great start vote
4621 2018-02-22 12:27:22 And where exactly is Trump on the gun issue? If he leads on legislation to ban bump stocks then he will have a more progressive recird on gun control than Obama did.
4622 2018-02-22 12:27:07 Defeatist attitude. No Constitutional issue. Fuck politics. If not now, when.

One week since slaughter, not one thing done, just talk.

Now bump stocks and bkgrnd checks. Why not after Vegas? Neither would have prevented this.

School safety not the issue, public safety is.
4623 2018-02-22 12:27:03 When Congress fears getting primaried by Voters, as much as they fear getting primaried by the NRA, then maybe our children will be safe in school, in church, at concerts, in movies, at a night club.
Assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, backgrounds
Public Safety
4624 2018-02-22 12:26:59 So, you're saying the NRA supports background checks, age restrictions, bans on high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, outlawing assault rifles, and doesn't support selling to people on the no-fly list?
4625 2018-02-22 12:26:55 #Robusta #Coffee #Stocks Ease Again; Now 44.7% Lower On Year
4626 2018-02-22 12:26:55 I can’t believe we’re arguing about bump stocks... that had a lot more to do w/ Las Vegas and our “leaders” barely mentioned them then... You don’t get brownie points for using buzz words.
4627 2018-02-22 12:26:52 I would also ban folding or telescoping stocks. Too easy to make a rifle small enough for a backpack
4628 2018-02-22 12:26:48 Sonia pl tell whether this stocks worth buying  I buy the stock  on your advice only
4629 2018-02-22 12:26:36 I seriously doubt Republicans will ban bump stocks.  They might and I say might raise the age to purchase an AR-15, add some useless mental health verbiage, but that's about it.  Got to vote em out if you want gun sense legislation @cspanwj
4630 2018-02-22 12:25:58 Marco couldn’t even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas, so his empathy is worth as much as Trump’s

4632 2018-02-22 12:25:49 Don�t ever stay in the bed unless you can make money in the bed. That�s why I invest in stocks. You make money in the bed. Any other suggestions?
4633 2018-02-22 12:23:46 @jimcramer Every time I hear that rising interest rates are good for stocks, I remember the 1970s. Too many pundits think there was no market before 2008.
4634 2018-02-22 12:23:39 There are many stocks in OI spurts list in nse. Any tips how to narrow down few high probable stocks for bigger moves intraday. Thanks

4637 2018-02-22 12:23:00 She kept it respectful in a hostile (to her) room.
But she was less than 100% honest on the NRA's long-held positions on background checks and bump stocks.
4638 2018-02-22 12:22:51 This is how Trump gets around not banning stocks and getting better background checks. He’ll say there are trained shooters in schools so why would we stop guns.
It keeps his base and the NRA happy.
4639 2018-02-22 12:20:50 Or bump stocks making them fully auto lol!
4640 2018-02-22 12:20:23 #ParklandStudents: DON"T ask that @GOP & @NRA do favors, like ban bump stocks or "look at background check system". Power is in your hands now. Pols, parents, teachers all want you back in school soon. #MAKEDEMANDSANDDONTBACKDOWN

4642 2018-02-22 12:19:44 @realDonaldTrump @GMA  So we’ve watched @realDonaldTrump sign executive orders for everything else, why not this. Background checks, age increase, gun shows included, bump stocks, mandatory gun registration, all guns.
4643 2018-02-22 12:19:11 The investors of those bonds are not in cash already for a reason. They won’t go there now either. They likely would be buying the bank stocks with the rise of rates behind them and good dividends to boot.

4647 2018-02-22 12:16:57 @morningmika @Morning_Joe Have you both had a mini-stroke? 
@POTUS agreed on bump stocks an background checks.
Come-on Team- on TV he agreed to sign anything on DACA he was brought. He agreed he would protect LGBT-Q Americans.
He promised to not touch social security or Medicare.
4648 2018-02-22 12:16:27 and miniso so lucky tdy got stocks and i bought them HAHAH
4649 2018-02-22 12:16:06 Mental health assessment and 5 day wait for a gun plus criminal background check plus 5 day wait plus no sale of semiautomatic rifles plus banning of bump stocks will help
4650 2018-02-22 12:15:35 No one is talking about disarming . How about gun law changes. Who needs Assault Weapons? What's wrong with stricter background checks, wait period to receive the gun, bump stocks age limits! What is with you and NAZIES are you one?
4651 2018-02-22 12:15:29 Outlaw the manufacture, sale and possession of bump stocks.
4652 2018-02-22 12:14:34 Yes. My answer is that you're over exaggerating.  No one is mowing crowds down in seconds with a hunting rifle.

I do agree with banning Full-Auto Mods that are made to circumvent current laws, such as Bump Stocks, but I will neverrrrr agree with banning all Semi Auto Weapons ..
4653 2018-02-22 12:14:25 We could make bump stocks illegal, for a start. Limit magazines to 10 rounds. Both measures would have saved many lives in Vegas.
4654 2018-02-22 12:14:01 Ban assault rifles,  ban bump stocks, raise age to 21, increase funding for mental health evaluation and treatment,  universal background checks. you say you want to make kids safe, listen and act
4655 2018-02-22 12:13:47 ダウしれっと戻ってんじゃんw
クソ中のクソだな
4656 2018-02-22 12:13:45 @Morning_Joe All that man did was sit in a room. He is nothing. He did nothing. How about an Executive Order for a national ELECTRONIC gun database; one for no bump stocks, and so on. That would be worth praising.
4657 2018-02-22 12:13:36 yung old ? yes may stocks po but yung new collab wala pa po
4658 2018-02-22 12:13:24 He should have asked all of them not just Rubio. Also,many democrats politicians have stocks investments in ammunition companies and they should divest from them. He was prepared but not enough to call them ALL out.
4659 2018-02-22 12:13:17 @morningmika and @JoeNBC @JeffreyGoldberg @CokieRoberts are right! The expectations is so low ...he is not the only POTUS who has done this. It's about his actions. Five months and nothing on Bump stocks. Once the media stops paying attention. The track record for this POTUS is
4660 2018-02-22 12:13:05 So that would be down to the council stocks not being replenished and house builders not building enough so they can keep the prices and profits high
4661 2018-02-22 12:12:55 The GOP may change or add to the gun control laws, like raising the minimum age to 21, and a big fat MAYBE on banning bump stocks. But nothing that would substantially cut annual sales.
4662 2018-02-22 12:12:28 #msnbc Bump stocks in this  environment is the low hanging fruit.
4663 2018-02-22 12:11:25 You clearly showed that all you care about is #NRABloodMoney .  You basically came out and supported the same items that Dana Loesch supported later like: don't let "crazy" people own guns, don't allow fully automatic weapons or work arounds like bump stocks.
4664 2018-02-22 12:10:25 Quartzy? Use it for stocks, chem inventory, equipment, everything
4665 2018-02-22 12:10:25 Hand guns and single shot riffles aren't what allows this evil to happen (those can be used for home/personal safety), it's high powered auto assault riffles & bump stocks & such. These weapons were illegal when I was a kid why are they legal now? Switchblades are illegal though!
4666 2018-02-22 12:10:15 I'm waiting for these stocks to make me some money
4667 2018-02-22 12:08:58 Stocks R already rebounding. Absolutely buy the dips. Give yourself a week and you’re practically guaranteed to make big $ — & U probably don’t even need to wait a week! U likely make big $ within days or even intraday. Volatility is a financial gift/windfall if U’re smart.
4668 2018-02-22 12:08:40 @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio  both of these guys are trying to do the least possible thing(background checks, age limits to buy guns, and ban bump stocks) regarding guns to continue to keep the NRA flowing into their pockets.....
4669 2018-02-22 12:08:16 Ja det kan du godt si, men det endrer ikke på det faktum at Græsvik ikke var helt presis her. Om Trumpelumpen skulle gjennomføre forbudet mot bump-stocks og flere begrensninger på hvem som kan eie våpen så vil han ha gjort mer for #GunControl enn Obama gjorde... smak på den du.

4673 2018-02-22 12:05:25 Why isn't it? 

Bump stocks shmumps stocks. In the IDF they teach you that you should never fire full auto, unless you are laying down suppressing fire (Usually LMGs). Very few ppl manage to use full Auto accurately. Plus, any soldier can fire rapidly with a semi-auto AR
4674 2018-02-22 12:05:12 No one reads the sun, it's a glorified picture book. That goes back again to investment with the council housing stocks being sold off and councils being hamstrung and not being allowed to build more. 

Treating properties as investments rather than homes is the issue

4676 2018-02-22 12:02:44 Banning bump stocks is only one thing.  ALL weapons of mass execution should be banned!
4677 2018-02-22 12:02:44 Trump says he want gun legislation restricting bump stocks and increasing the minimum age of a purchaser. He also boldly came out for marbles to be really really round and apple pies to be baked before being served. #BS #GunReformNow
4678 2018-02-22 12:02:40 3-6 are idiotic and unconstitutional.What other protected right would you suggest putting such requirements on?

7.Why ban a class of firearms not used in crimes?
Bump stocks were developed to aid handicapped shooters who can't pull a conventional trigger.

4680 2018-02-22 12:02:15 Technically you are both right. It depends on the frame of reference on how you are using the term. In this instance he was comparing to for profit organizations one that is publicly owned through stocks and another that is privately owned by one or two people.

4682 2018-02-22 12:01:43 Regarding bump stocks. Make them class three weapons, rather than banning them.  Stringent background checks are required for class three weapons such as full auto guns.
4683 2018-02-22 12:01:29 Just a thought - demand pull inflation is not necessarily bad for stocks. Only if you are at your capacity limits or otherwise poor operating leverage. Otherwise it should not be an issue to outpace your higher outgo on Working Cap financing.
4684 2018-02-22 12:01:12 Trump is moving to ban bump stocks, which is doing more for gun control than Obama did in EIGHT YEARS.
Thank you @realdon
4685 2018-02-22 12:00:58 These lines are good for trending markets , what about stupid volatile chops in individual stocks
4686 2018-02-22 11:59:49 It took 4 months after Las Vegas massacre for #POTUS to ban bump stocks.  Time puts distance between a horrific event and politicians move to change.  Business as usual in a few weeks.  #NeverAgain
4687 2018-02-22 11:59:35 We grow tired of your halfhearted gestures, Senator. This, and the bump stocks bill that went nowhere, are fine but far from the common sense reform the majority of Texans support.  Don’t break your arm patting yourself on the back.
4688 2018-02-22 11:57:55 I’m comfortable with cops being at our schools. But it’s NOT the solution. Banning guns is the only way to stop this. Our kids right to LIFE is more important than the right to own bump stocks & assault rifles & other unnecessary toys.
4689 2018-02-22 11:57:33 Yes, many of the blockchain stocks are scams, even more than ICO's.
4690 2018-02-22 11:57:16 And he just “suggested” to the DOJ ban bump stocks. Which is totally pointless except for the news headline making him look proactive. DOJ can’t ban bump stocks. If he really wanted them banned he’d tell congress to ban them.

4700 2018-02-22 11:53:17 Trump's idea of "regulating guns" is "ban bump stocks", which is the minimal, most symbolic action which we could have taken in response to the *last* high-profile mass shooting, and "eliminate gun-free zones and arm schoolteachers".

More guns. More violence. More dead children.

4702 2018-02-22 11:52:00 The methodology can't throw light on why a specific stock is added or deleted. Because adding or deleting one stock also mean NOT taking the same action on a bunch of other stocks that all meet the same criteria
4703 2018-02-22 11:51:58 Bump stocks really aren’t the issue. Was a bump stock used? Any gun can be modified. There are too many guns out there. Too late to shut the door.
4704 2018-02-22 11:51:00 How does @BarackObama stand in this list? He introduced bump stocks.

Oh, I don't see his name on the list.
4705 2018-02-22 11:50:02 You do realize bump stocks weren't even used in this school shooting right?
The 17 people killed in the florida shooting would have still died even if bump stock were banned, all of this talk about bannibg them is just to make it look like the american goverment is fixing things.
4706 2018-02-22 11:49:01 The gun rights advocates who insist that there can be NO restrictions on  gun ownership in America deserve vilification.

We restrict speech when there is threat of harm ("FIre!" shouted in a movie theater.) 

We allow bump stocks. We allow an expelled teenager to purchase AR-15s

I have a President who never speak on any issue, obviously the worst in my country's history. 
The order to ban bump stocks devices is a good  move. Stronger background checks & red flags should never be ignored.

4735 2018-02-22 11:29:07 When you are arming people with semi-automatic weapons, fighting to allow bump stocks to continue being sold and against raising the age to purchase these weapons from 18 to 21 - then you are a terrorist organization. You are fighting to allow our kids to die. PC is done.
4736 2018-02-22 11:28:16 Right. The AR-15 is just a customizable rifle.

Also, it isn’t tactically superior for committing these atrocities. (Bump stocks is another issue, but I believe those were only used in the Vegas massacre.) There’s just some psychological reason these murderers keep using AR-15’s.
4737 2018-02-22 11:27:46 Anytime stocks in one sector represent more than 20 percent of an index there is 'danger,' says Bill Smead.
4738 2018-02-22 11:27:00 Just like Trump callings for a ban on bump stocks. I’ll take what I can get.
4739 2018-02-22 11:26:49 @MyShopGranny Stocks all things cool that’s where Bill came from
4740 2018-02-22 11:26:38 Senator Feinstein: I appreciate you and support you. But this has moved beyond bump stocks. That should’ve happened after Las Vegas. It didn’t. If we settle for that, it will be all we get until the next shooting. We have to go for broke and demand a ban on semi-automatic rifles.
4741 2018-02-22 11:26:13 It took courage for you to show up last night and listen...but you are wrong ...most Americans do not feel that semi auto guns, bump stocks and other weapons of war are necessary to own....their only function is to kill ....
4742 2018-02-22 11:25:24 Remember after Los Vegas when GOP was absolutely going to enact meaningful gun regulation & ban bump stocks? Did they? Rubio & his ilk are trying to buy time for GOP until this blows over. Except it won't blow over this time. GOP can either enact gun regs or lose big in Nov.
4743 2018-02-22 11:24:35 @realDonaldTrump - you redeemed yourself by banning the sale of "bump stocks" but then returned to your ridiculous ways by saying you would arm teachers. You really are the cum stain on the duvet of society.

4745 2018-02-22 11:24:15 Early move? Vegas was nearly 5 months ago and Tuesday was the 1st time he mentioned bump stocks. How many sold since October?
4746 2018-02-22 11:23:57 @DarrenSoto:
1. Universal background checks
2. Keep guns away from those who are a danger to others or themselves 
3. Ban assault weapons & bump stocks
4. Create Red Flag System gun-violence restraining orders
5. No Fly, No Buy -- bans guns for those on FBI terrorist watch list

4750 2018-02-22 11:20:12 T'as pris quoi comme tee ? Et ils ont pas augmenté un peu les stocks récemment ?
4751 2018-02-22 11:19:59 If a semi-automatic AR is a “weapon of war,” we really need to take another look at our defense budget to make sure we’re adequately resourcing the 18 year-olds we send to fight wars.  I’ve been retired a few years now, but I don’t think they’ve adopted bump stocks either.
4752 2018-02-22 11:19:27 So much for a good inter island ferry, when we gave them the contract did the great and the good know we only had 7 favarable crossing, if they did they need to be put in stocks and if they didn't they still need to be put in stocks for giving a contract without knowing facts

4755 2018-02-22 11:18:43 Many of the mass shooters are mentally troubled. That's why she points to a measure to decrease mass shootings at schools, namely forcing states to report mental illness to the federal govenment. Thereby, the NRA has called for a ban on bump stocks.
4756 2018-02-22 11:17:57 Yup correct, I have always followed a rule 3rd day bounce a stock will fall for 2 days and on the 3rd day will bounce the 4th will be a good indicator of what to expect next  works most of the time. $GSW type stocks can make you $$ or cost you $$ know your limits
4757 2018-02-22 11:17:04 That's not entirely true. AR-15s are easily modifiable (e.g bump stocks, high capacity magazines) and are easy to shoot with little recoil. Its for many of these reasons it is the choice weapon of war for soldiers rather than handguns. I do agree its a multifaceted solution.
4758 2018-02-22 11:16:47 I just need a hug

4759 2018-02-22 11:15:21 Neither the @gop or the @dnc want GUNS on their platform ... more security, better mental health, stricter purchase regulations, bump stocks, anything but GUNS.
4760 2018-02-22 11:15:09 Consensus seems to be forming on some gun control measures like raising the age of ownership, tighter background checks, gun restraining orders and eliminating bump stocks. There's even plenty of talk about arming teachers. Will any of these, especially arming teachers, work?
4761 2018-02-22 11:15:01 By offering policies that were a response to the *last* mass shooting tragedy. Why didn't he propose banning bump stocks after Las Vegas? A: politics. He's only conceding it now because children are dying in American schools. It wouldn't have saved them. This is the ~GOP~ NRA

1)Add at the comfortable level 
2) Add again if it falls further 
3) Add on the bounce when downtrend is clearly over

4775 2018-02-22 11:04:21 That’s true. Most are. I am. But the bull-headedness about AR-15s, bump stocks, etc., is what people like me (gun owner, but not a “let me buy whatever I want” person) don’t understand. We need to go back to the policy in place at end of GHW Bush’s term.

These are not solutions, they are control and an easy way for a politician to say “SEE I DID SOMETHING!”

4820 2018-02-22 10:33:17 So telling me that the 2nd Amendment protects your individual right to bear arms may be debatable, whereas the possession of assault rifles and bump stocks is obviously in no way protected.
4821 2018-02-22 10:33:01 It's all throwing spaghetti against the wall hoping something, ANYTHING except access to guns, sticks.

4833 2018-02-22 10:23:36 Bump stocks turn semi-auto rifles into machine guns like in the Vegas and Parkland shootings. These are military grade weapons & should be banned.

An AR-15 style Bushmaster was used in SandyHook, an M-16 in Aurora, not handguns.

4835 2018-02-22 10:23:19 It’s a term to describe rifles that fire with selectable fire modes (semi / full auto). I agree that technically an AR15 is not fire selectable and therefore is not an assault rifle. However given the fire rate and availability of bump stocks they can behave like an assault rifle
4836 2018-02-22 10:22:32 ok I want the 205 military style assault weapons banned from future sale and all bump stocks banned and magazines that hold more than 15 rounds...yes I've changed some of my demands... you should have taken what I offered to begin with...lol you still haven't (1/4)
4837 2018-02-22 10:22:30 Rubio was actually stating a valid case. The AR- 15 is not an assault rifle. It’s a semi automatic. It can be modified with bump stocks. Which are now banned. Actual assault rifles are banned. At least I think so.
4838 2018-02-22 10:21:55 Stocks yan. Hahaha. 
4839 2018-02-22 10:20:19 Exactly, never! Trump can’t just ban bump stocks, he can’t EO them away & he knows that. But that’s his way of saying he’s going to do something & when it doesn’t happen, blame someone . The ATF has stated that the President lacks the authority it must be legislated by Congress.

4853 2018-02-22 10:10:47 We have no idea. No other period had this level of debt for corp, consumer & govn. GDP is likely to be <2.5. Rates are rising for wrong reason. Retail rolled over. Mortgages slowing. Consumers may be broke. Stocks rising on expectations of the tax plan. May be at peak now.
4854 2018-02-22 10:10:05 Actually, I believe polls of the full American electorate do support a ban of semi-automatic weapons. Polls also greatly support expanding background checks, increasing age to purchase, restricting magazine sizes, eliminating bump-stocks.
4855 2018-02-22 10:08:09 San Bernardino Shooters didn’t use bump stocks. They used a feature called the “bullet button” which is installed by gun manufacturers themselves, allowing the gun to be equipped with a high magazine.
4856 2018-02-22 10:05:16 If the NRA was all about responsible gun ownership they’d lead the charge against bump stocks, assault weapons, large magazines & “gun shows”  Nope the NRA is a lobby for the gun industry period. Its all about the $$

4873 2018-02-22 09:58:44 California modified the hell out of the AR-15 to be lawful in the state, like the bullet button, yet we had that mass shooting in San Bernardino. Bump stocks are illegal in Cali too
4874 2018-02-22 09:57:55 One more clarification I believe stocks all over the world works the same way . But my question is can I try this on liquid stocks as well ?  I understand not to be greedy but what's your take on this .?

4877 2018-02-22 09:54:04 Okay I am for stricter Gun laws don't get me wrong. But People want change now, and i'm sorry that's not going to happen.
1. Modifications like Drum Mags and even the stock 25 round mags need to be changed.
2. Bump stocks and other Modifications like it should be banned.
4878 2018-02-22 09:51:54 He blows with the wind.
Listening to the kids his first reaction is to "sign a decree" to get someone to legislate to ban bump stocks (note: not actually ban them now).
Now he has listened to the NRA & their sick fantasy of arming teachers, with no thought of how stupid that is.
4879 2018-02-22 09:50:39 Bump stocks make your gun hyper inaccurate and you'll miss the trigger alot. And they've never once been used in a school shooting.

4885 2018-02-22 09:43:10 Bump stocks make them fire faster.  No reason for a private citizen to own an assault rifle.
4886 2018-02-22 09:42:49 You wanna fix this? Expand background checks. Anything mental health related in a medical setting? put into a database. That gets checked too. Bump stocks, any means to tamper with or hasten firing mechanism, banned. No fly list? you don't buy a gun.

4900 2018-02-22 09:29:26 My favorite is when probably 90% of people had never even heard of bump stocks until the Las Vegas shooting but now all of a sudden we need actual legislation to outlaw something that’s been used in ONE mass shooting and, as an accessory, isn’t protected under the 2nd Amendment.

4914 2018-02-22 09:20:35 Rather than doing what's necessary, they are offering up bump stocks as a sacrificial lamb, so they can try to look good and "dodge the bullet" on the more pertinent issue of banning assault rifles.
4915 2018-02-22 09:20:00 No, our country has a right to a well-armed militia. Not the same thing as Joe Q Public having the right to own AR-15s with rapid load, high capacity barrel clips, & bump stocks.
4916 2018-02-22 09:18:49 Dana doesn’t have to come out and say ban guns or bump stocks but I’m pretty sure she knows what could make it more difficult for people to get access to the weapons but that would cut into her yearly bonus.
4917 2018-02-22 09:18:40 Having guns already IN schools? Recipe for disaster.
#BanAssaultWeapons  Should be illegal to make, sale, buy, own assault weapons & enforced w high penalty. Semi automatics, bump stocks are for lethal attack on many. 
Not for civilians to own. Hunting rifle, small hand gun, yes.
4918 2018-02-22 09:17:39 Why would anyone want to buy bump stocks?!
4919 2018-02-22 09:17:35 Despite F&O expiry deadlines today, stock markets are bleeding with even shortcovering a little bit. Had the deadline not there, the markets would have tanked more than 500 points today. #NiravModi impact is still sliding the stocks on Dalal Street...

4921 2018-02-22 09:15:10 Don’t make it about the Left. We’re all humans. Huge magazines then. The style of gun. The fire/reload speed. The rate at which one can kill. Adding bump stocks. Do these types of guns/accessories have to be available? Are they worth it for the consequences? In my opinion, no.
4922 2018-02-22 09:14:30 @SenFeinstein After the Vegas mass shooting, was it you that introduced the bill to ban bump stocks but the GOP wouldn't do anything with it?
4923 2018-02-22 09:13:43  Look outside of your own country at gun laws and school shooting statistics.. you can’t argue with facts. Making petty changes to ban bump-stocks or more stringent checks won’t cut it I’m afraid. Your country is way behind on gun logic. As for arming teachers

4954 2018-02-22 09:00:04 The shooter in Florida was never adjudicated as mentally ill and a danger. There was nothing for state to report. Also, NRA did not come out against bump stocks and is against raising age to obtain weapons. @Emma4Change did a great job w a manipulative person who was deflecting.

4968 2018-02-22 08:54:24 I love how people say that if your parents didn't save money for you to go to college, then you don't deserve it because your family wasn't good with money. Sure, Britta, a single mother who doesn't even know where her next meal will come from should really invest in stocks...

4970 2018-02-22 08:53:31 He will, and you most definitely will not. Obama managed nothing in 8 years and you still laud him over it, heart in right place etc. Just banning bump stocks will be more than BO did, and that's just the start..

4982 2018-02-22 08:48:18 If I’m not mistaken, he signed the order for banning of bump stocks on 2/20. So I think we can at least count that one thing down. But seriously, just no more gun sales to mentally unfit, and hold private and corporate sellers more accountable. The gun show rules are too lax, too

4993 2018-02-22 08:42:58 The 3 ideas I agree with 
for recreational, hunting and home invasion protection guns are
1) Increase the legal age to buy a gun 
2) Ban bump stocks
3) Short clip all automatics
4994 2018-02-22 08:42:25 I can agree with that. I haven't got to look into it last few days like I normally wld cause Ive been busy, but I actually think he's leaning towards looking into some regulations and banning the bump stocks which is what every1 was throwing a fit about. So I guess we shall see.

5086 2018-02-22 07:45:19 When you have a pinned tweet on your page referring to giving civvies "assault rifles", it does tend to piss some people off. Last time I checked, "assault rifles" were select-fire, not semi-auto. Bump-stocks? Never should have been allowed. Mag cap lims would have been good too.
5087 2018-02-22 07:45:13 @dash_bandy , what can u say about the stocks now? Supporting elected leaders of our country will HELP all of us economically, NOT divide
5088 2018-02-22 07:45:03 Open debates are awesome and I don't think we have enough of them and no fascism is bad pls don't think I want that lol, & that's interesting to know that you'd be willing to give up bump stocks, I thought all gun owners would be opposed to that.

5095 2018-02-22 07:42:13 a lot of people in the gun community actually got pretty upset with the NRA for suggesting that they investigate bump stocks further after the vegas shooting, which was pretty uncharacteristic for them as normally they're steadfast in not letting anything get banned or restricted

5098 2018-02-22 07:39:39 Name these liberals.  I can't name one.  It certainly is possible that a few do but the vast majority of people favoring gun control want universal background checks, banning of bump stocks and restrictions on the sale of assault weapons.
5099 2018-02-22 07:39:21 @CBOwenII things I'd support 1) universal background checks 2) no gun if hx domestic violence 3) ban bump stocks 4) limit magazines to ~10 rounds 5) at least temporary (5-10yr) assault weapon ban 6) no guns for no fly list (if due process in place to challenge no fly placement)
5100 2018-02-22 07:38:16 Also, I think they're going to pass limited gun control. Better background checks and ban bump stocks. There's no way that they'll ban any type of weapon.

5104 2018-02-22 07:36:21 I don't think they had AR-15s (and the like) readily available to the populace, nor 'bump stocks,' in decades past. 
Coincidence?
5105 2018-02-22 07:36:08 @realDonaldTrump We the American people Elected you to help Preserve our 2nd Amendment Rights. The NRA has been Infiltrated by liberals. I don't see a use for Bump Stocks, however if you give a Liberal an inch they'll take a lightyear. Please don't fall into thier trap.

5108 2018-02-22 07:35:01 I've just listed a few of the many ways to approach this situation. Straight up banning any kind of guns would be the worst solution to this. Bump-stocks are pretty much pointless and should be banned or extremely heavily regulated like automatic firearms.
5109 2018-02-22 07:34:45 Bitcoin isn’t stocks
5110 2018-02-22 07:32:53 But banning semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks would be a start!
5111 2018-02-22 07:32:31 I prefer telescope stocks.  Laughing ones move to much i hear. Makes it difficult for tight groupings st 300 yards.

5118 2018-02-22 07:29:14 Misinformation is dangerous. Bump stocks don't alter a firearm, and don't make a firearm fully automatic, as this misinformed activist suggests. When your position begins with a lie, it's hard to take you seriously. More kids being used by liberals
5119 2018-02-22 07:29:08 It’s a “he” you laughing stocks.
5120 2018-02-22 07:29:01 Really? Then why did all the NRA supported politicians “shoot” down proposed regulations against bump stocks after Las Vegas?
5121 2018-02-22 07:28:15 I’m not advocating repealing the 2nd-but do want sensible laws: waiting periods, reinstate bans for some rifles, bump stocks, high capacity mags, etc. I use to sell guns/rifles...no one needs ALL that for self defense

5131 2018-02-22 07:23:23 Bump Stocks are largely silly gizmos, but when it comes to rights, even losing the silliest rights can lead to a loss of serious rights. It’s a slippery slope folks. And if you don’t think so consider this, we have a president that would be fine with state controlled media.
5132 2018-02-22 07:23:16 You will NEVER get rid of handguns or longguns. However, the magazine round capacity should be 10, federal law should change to reflect that. Also, "bump stocks" should be illegal across the board. Start simple. Legislation is already in the works to eliminate "bump stocks."
5133 2018-02-22 07:23:09 Absolutely NO on arming teachers in schools!!! Please use common sense and quit the legal sales of the AR style weapons.  Quit the bump stocks!!!  Let those who want to buy guns go through background checks and proper vetting.  Please allow us to live without fear!!!!
5134 2018-02-22 07:22:56 Bump stocks are not guns. They are mods, mods whose only purpose is to empty a clip as quickly as possible. Removing them from the public infringes on no rights, it only decreases killing potential.
5135 2018-02-22 07:22:45 ありえんさむいのでお市かえります
5136 2018-02-22 07:22:34 Then don't regulate the Bump Stocks
5137 2018-02-22 07:21:51 @NRA could've stopped paying @GOP , Republican Presidents,  Ban assault rifles and bump stocks for civilians, semi-automatic weapons that could be converted into full automatic. Could've stopped this tragedy.

5143 2018-02-22 07:17:36 How about some tougher punishment!!!  Flog this guy in public then put him in stocks for a few days then hang him by his neck until he is dead. That should deter some future fame seekers

5148 2018-02-22 07:16:36 These kids beg to differ, they are walking out of school to protest. Even P-robes says ban bump stocks and AR-15 American preachers are the last to sue for peace out of loyalty to Cthulhu. #resistCthulhu Disruption wins.

5150 2018-02-22 07:16:29 You're right. But there are "bump stocks" which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire repeatedly at a rate closer to that of a fully automatic weapon. Essentially, they convert semi-automatics into fully automatics.

5157 2018-02-22 07:14:22 In my view, none of the good stocks are yet at good valuation. The fall did not last long, hence, no one got the chance to enter. Still more pain and correction of about 3-4% left, before we can head upwords. 

Again market is supreme. Time will only tell. No trades based on view
5158 2018-02-22 07:13:41 How about reinstating the assault rifle ban, banning bump stocks, increased wait periods, background checks.
5159 2018-02-22 07:13:09 No we are not sinking. We are stronger and better than 5 million wannabe John Waynes. Besides the majority of these gun owners want strong background checks, don't  want bump stocks or AR-15/any assault rifles, out on the streets for civilians to do crazy things.
5160 2018-02-22 07:12:29 did you see what happened today? Trump is banning bump stocks !!!

5161 2018-02-22 07:12:14 U know what you need to do.  Ban production, manufacture and sale of semi-automatic & automatic weapons, bump stocks, and ammo cartridges >3 bullets. $for mental health screening and training.  Strict background checks, age limits to purchase guns. Think of Barron.

5177 2018-02-22 07:06:17 1)Restrict weapons of war to police and Military. 
2)Reinstate the bill keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.
3)Raise the age to 21 for any gun purchase.
4)Ban bump stocks.
Still have guns.

5185 2018-02-22 07:01:51 Those potential changes are the absolute bare minimum that can be called doing something. Bump stocks are just not that common, being a 3rd party accessory. Most 18-21s don’t buy; their ownership is usually by gift. 1/2 of 18-21 live in dorms, where guns are forbidden anyway.
5186 2018-02-22 07:01:25 full auto is illegal, bump stocks just got illegal....
5187 2018-02-22 07:00:17 Common sence gun laws. Ban bump stocks, universal background checks, closing the gun show LOOPHOLES and Internet sales. Personally I do not believe in assault weapons in civilian use and would support a ban. I am not  advocating in any abolishing of the 2nd Ammend rights.

5210 2018-02-22 06:46:42 The thing that bothers me about the debates that occur after every mass shooting is that the majority of the regulations being discussed (mental illness, bump stocks, violent rap sheets, etc.) would NOT stop most mass shootings, particularly school shootings.  1/4
5211 2018-02-22 06:46:03 That's just marketing, sure. If you prefer 'modern sporting rifles'... Other than killing lots of people, I don't see the use case for a semi-auto rifle with up to 30 round clips capable of (possibly) firing military grade ammo.  And that's not even going into bump stocks..
5212 2018-02-22 06:45:39 Need to get assault rifles and high capacity magazines banned. Bottom line. it's the number or rounds/bullets that is causing the death toll. Not bump stocks. An AR-15 can be modified to fully automatic for $50. That wasn't the problem in Parkdale. Big changes are needed.
5213 2018-02-22 06:45:38 Better access to mental health treatment.  
Universal backgrounds 
Restrictions on ammo 
If SSI for mental illness, you don't get a gun.  
Require safety classes
No bump stocks
biometrics to unlock 
No one under  21
Cap the # of guns you can own
Ban high cap mags
Ban on autos

I can achieve same effect with a standard stock unmodified firearm & a belt loop.

5221 2018-02-22 06:41:57 I'm all for common sense.
Banning or requiring additional licensing of bump stocks is common sense.
I'm all for expaned reporting of mental illness treatment. 
However, the HIPAA issue needs to be addressed in that as well as treatment and physician input in consideration.....
5222 2018-02-22 06:41:57 NRA doesn’t promote “gun rights for all” so much as fight for absolutely no laws of any kind relating to mass-casualty-capable, military-grade, armaments for all.

Why fight against bump stocks?
For high capacity magazines? Silencers? Tactical features? Unregistered sales? Why?
5223 2018-02-22 06:41:50 Dianne do you believe that there should be background checks on all sales? How do you feel about a ban on bump stocks, cranks & high capacity magazines?
5224 2018-02-22 06:41:36 #5) I am against outlawing Bump Stocks based on principle but they are stupid so do what you want with them.

5228 2018-02-22 06:40:22 Because, it was way over valued. I still see any point to enter in any stocks for long term. Still 5-6% correction is on the cards. My views.
5229 2018-02-22 06:40:20 Bump stocks should be banned.  But you do realize a shooter can get the same result by simply putting a thumb through a belt loop while shooting would have the same effect.  Putting a band-aid on a bleeding artery does not stop anything
5230 2018-02-22 06:40:05 I see problems on both sides. BOTH SIDES NOT EQUAL ON LOSS OF LIFE. People don't want to compromise on bumb stocks, SAY NO to them; YET law makers CUT funding for mental health; WHY? FBI IS A JOKE for dropping the ball... yet let us call names. #StudentsStandUp

5233 2018-02-22 06:39:09 I want background checks on ALL sales. And ban on bump stocks, cranks & high capacity magazines. I think an assault weapon ban is reasonable, but think that training/special license for those weapons could work.

5235 2018-02-22 06:38:06 He already knows he can't do the regulation he talked about, because bump stocks aren't part of the law.  He was told that months ago.  It is just an appearance.  He knows it takes a bill.

5240 2018-02-22 06:34:39 Additionally, I am in favor of expanded waiting periods, outlawing bump stocks, and outlawing high capacity magazines. However, also creating a federal 50-state CCW. Responsible gun owners should get less friction. Criminals and likely criminals, much more friction.

5243 2018-02-22 06:34:13 Just a REMINDER... @GOP and @potus along with the NRA caved and agreed  on OCT 1, 2017 to BAN bump-stocks.... 3,000 tweets and countless Executive orders stripping away American progress made for the people and almost 6 months later LIP SERVICE on 100 of dead Americans!

5248 2018-02-22 06:32:04 No, have armed security, metal dectectors & search bags coming into school. Video monitoring off as well that will prevent. Add mental health check, raising age to buy gun, ban bump stocks & we make serious dent in preventing these shootings from happening.
5249 2018-02-22 06:31:52 Bump stocks was always a distraction, designed to appease people with something the NRA doesn't care about in order to put even more guns into American "culture"
5250 2018-02-22 06:30:59 You are a domestic terrorist organization that profits off the killing of children. Firearms company stocks go up after every mass killing and you get paid dividends in their blood as you fight EVERY sensible effort at gun reform.
5251 2018-02-22 06:30:56 & shooter wouldn't have been able to commit such a horrible offense if commonsense regs in place:
Assault rifles banned
Bump stocks banned
All guns req'd
- background check
- social media check
- psych test
- safety training
Ammunition regs
Felons & domestic violence banned
5252 2018-02-22 06:30:21 Cruz passed a federally mandated background check. It didn’t stop him. I don’t think anything could have prevented the Florida mass shooting, aside from repealing the Second Amendment. A “Bump Stocks” Ban wont do anything. I never even heard the term before last year
5253 2018-02-22 06:29:40 8. Tell them that the NRA will allow me to talk about banning bump stocks.
5254 2018-02-22 06:29:16 I’m trying to find out just what politicians r getting money from NRA and let them know the gigs up. Mothers against auto guns , bump stocks and all that that causes mass casualties. This is sooo over the top. Kat
5255 2018-02-22 06:28:53 No, they did not cause this. But they have created an environment where lawmakers & civil servants are afraid to draw their attention by doing anything to regulate firearms. If anyone had moved against bump stocks before 1 Oct 2017, the NRA would have dropped the hammer on them.
5256 2018-02-22 06:28:27 I wouldn't give him the dignity of a body bag, I'd put him in the stocks with a notice saying "I'm one of Thatcher's offspring, please kick me". They'd be queueing round the block for the privilege. And as for Paul Dacre, don't get me started.

5259 2018-02-22 06:27:50 I am a 2nd amendment supporter & own many guns myself, however I’m not a fan of the assult rifles, bump stocks or lax background checks on some! Don’t you dare try to take away any other gun of mine. even removing assault rifle’s is not going to solve this problem it’s the people
5260 2018-02-22 06:27:50 Here's a simple ? Simple as the one asked of Marco Rubio & NRA $ Which would u & most of @NRA members vote for...A) making bump stocks illegal across the US or B) making uzis & AK 47s legal to sell & own by 18 year olds. Give your HONEST answer. You can only choose 1.
5261 2018-02-22 06:27:33 Best we can hope for is the smaller measures like banning bump stocks etc as they are heading towards atm sadly.
5262 2018-02-22 06:26:35 Is the argument about banning AR-15's and bump stocks or stopping gun deaths? Or both?  If so why? They kill 1% of all gun deaths, about 100-200 annually. If 10,000 die from guns a year, and most from handguns, why are we having this discussion?
5263 2018-02-22 06:26:18 That said, when someone like that Cruz nut can go buy a gun dispite so many eating signs he was a menace to society, something is wrong. We need a universal background check system, mandatory mental health evaluations every time anyone buys a gun, a ban on bump stocks...
5264 2018-02-22 06:25:35 Ur tweet says that states

5265 2018-02-22 06:25:27 We need to fight for significant incremental change today, and an assault weapon ban in the midterms.

1 - Minimum age limit
2 - No bump stocks
3 - Better and universal background checks.

Any of these will save some lives before the midterms. Even saving 1 more life is worth it.

5272 2018-02-22 06:23:04 Achtergrondcontroles, verbod op AR’s, verbod op ‘bump stocks’, verbod op hoogcapaciteit magazijnen, verhogen van de minimum leeftijd naar 21 jaar, verbod op verkoop aan mensen met psychische problemen en een wacht periode van 10 dagen. Het is niet zo moeilijk hoor!

5284 2018-02-22 06:16:01 Well the facts when it comes to bump stocks are it is just as effective if not more effective to use a rubber band or your belt loop instead of a bump stock. Outlawing them will make no difference if somebody wants that capability
5285 2018-02-22 06:15:40 Bump stocks are simply a mechanical aid for a technique. One that can be replicated with a sling.

Define "high capacity."

Kevlar vests have a variety of ratings, based upon their effectiveness. Rating 2 can stop 9mm, but a .44 punches through it.
5286 2018-02-22 06:15:33 @realDonaldTrump I’m feeling betrayed Mr. president you’ve been a different type of president compared to others, but banning bump fire stocks is not going to help, sir. Again you want to get rid of school shootings get rid of #gun free zones they do not work

5289 2018-02-22 06:14:05 I’m only against what is unreasonable, i think bump stocks are. I don’t see much wrong with AR15s truthfully, and i am only trying to have a discussion with people on both sides. I believe in the 2nd, just need to hear the facts
5290 2018-02-22 06:14:05 I don’t think we disagree. I don’t embrace gun control. But I don’t reject it either. 

Bump stocks are a good place to start. Weapons bans for individuals by legal process with oversight and appeals, also.
5291 2018-02-22 06:13:52 AR stands for Armalite Rifle. It’s semi-auto. You can buy long barrel rifles (hunting rifle) that are semi-auto. I agree that bump stocks, extended mags and mass ammo purchases need to be eliminated and illegal. The gun never will be. I’m just breaking reality to ya.

5293 2018-02-22 06:12:59 Ban bump stocks? Ban ANYTHING?
Avoid emotionalism (and legal bloat) with a scientific approach:
1) Auto-expire the ban in 5 years.
2) Auto-create a study of actual effects in 4 years.
3) Act with a better informed perspective.
5294 2018-02-22 06:11:46 I agree on the bump stocks but not on banning by the AR15.
5295 2018-02-22 06:11:14 Do you think we should ban bump stocks? High capacity magazines? Bullets designed to pierce kevlar vests?
5296 2018-02-22 06:11:07 So you are against guns having longer barrels and having butt stocks?? (Seeing as how that's the only difference between AR-15 pistols and AR-15 rifles)
5297 2018-02-22 06:10:33 Bump stocks weren't banned after NV.  They're using this as a litmus test for the politicians they own, & to gauge the loyalty of the brainwashed flock that they fleece.  That, and it distracts from demands for real, significant gun control, including a ban on assault rifles.

5301 2018-02-22 06:08:10 Keep and bear your six-shooters and hunting rifles. There's nothing in there about semi-auto rifles with high capacity clips, silencers, and bump stocks.

5303 2018-02-22 06:07:59 How about we just talk about common sense gun laws.. stronger background checks, maybe limit access to certain guns, or bump stocks even. Sure, criminals may still get guns, but why not at least try to make it a little harder? The rhetoric that it’s pointless is the problem.
5304 2018-02-22 06:07:53 not at all, better through background checks and true shareable database, no bump stocks, extendos and what not. Better doesnt mean oppressive.

5310 2018-02-22 06:06:42 Stick to what you say or implied. National background checks and not fighting banning bump stocks. Find middle ground in age requirements and magazine sizes. I don’t agree with the NRA or the current Republican administration but was floored I agreed with you in some areas. Kudos
5311 2018-02-22 06:06:24 Just as a point of correction. Bump stocks do NOT allow a “semi automatic weapon to fire automatically.” The firing mechanism and process of the weapon remains unchanged. 

The bump stock does however increase the rate of that cycle. It is a subtle but important distinction.

5315 2018-02-22 06:04:11 Trump talks about restricting bump stocks.  Pelosi tried to get GOP Congress to pass legislation on add-ons so they could not be sold. Nothing has happened in 5 years.  Trump’s talk is empty words.  Get Congress moving on this.
5316 2018-02-22 06:04:02 Also not against banning bump stocks. I don’t think banning the AR-15 will do anything. It’s just a semi auto hunting rifle. Handguns can get faster bullets per second in skilled hands. The AR just looks the scariest so it gets vilified the most.
5317 2018-02-22 06:03:06 I genuinely can't understand what they're afraid of. Background checks, assault rifles/ bump stocks ban wouldn't change much.
5318 2018-02-22 06:02:39 Gun enthusiasts should be trained, licensed, insured, thorough background checks, maintain weapons at a club etc like in many countries. No need for semi auto, large clips, high impact rounds, bump stocks, silencers, conceal licenses #gunsense #GunSafetyNow
5319 2018-02-22 06:02:22 @POTUS - Laws on bump stocks
are #statesrights - US congress
can't pass such laws - altho
banning them is a good idea
.
5320 2018-02-22 06:02:04 Annnnndddd... thats a lie @SenRubioPress.  No Semi-autos with barrels <20 inches, no folding stocks, no pistol grips, no Mags >12 rounds, no mod kits to increase fire rates or add pistol grips.  No Silencers.  That's a start.
5321 2018-02-22 06:01:54 Arming teachers and expecting them to protect students is not the solution. We need to get Gun CONTROL. Start with banning assault rifles, bump stocks, mentally unstable, and raising the age to purchase.

5324 2018-02-22 06:00:22 Also you did know everyone’s “favorite” president Obama made Bump Stocks legal? Bump stocks go on any semi automatic rifle and simulates a fully automatic by using the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to fire shots rapidly. But @POTUS made them illegal. Did you know that?

5331 2018-02-22 05:58:25 Never said it was.  They just need to take a dtance and support sensible guns laws.  Bump stocks are damn loop hole in the law.  Why haven't they said anything in the past?   Now, it's too late.

5333 2018-02-22 05:58:02 So your angry he has ordered the ban of bump stocks?  Or are you confused?
5334 2018-02-22 05:57:45 @POTUS - US congress can't pass
laws to ban bump stocks - read
Art. 1 Sec 8
.
It's #statesrights and a good idea

5335 2018-02-22 05:57:13 Trump finally moving forward to take away bump stocks. Finally some common sense gun control. A step in the right direction @RobertRainey80
5336 2018-02-22 05:56:57 BAN ASSAULT RIFLES, BUMP STOCKS & ASSORTED ADD ONS, EXTEND BCKGRND CKS, CLOSE SHOW LOOPHOLE, KEEP DATA, DON'T INDEMNITY GUN MANUFACTURERS, INCREASE PROHIBITED SALES (MENTALLY ILL), RAISE AGE TO PURCHASE,  DENY ABUSERS, SEVERE PENALTIES 4 VIOLATORS.
5337 2018-02-22 05:56:31 Or limit the magazine to 18 & ban larger stocks or do like Chris Rock said raise the price of bullets cuz if a AR 15 bullet cost $100 bucks per bullet, lot less bullets getting bought. I mean I'm being a bit facetious but we gotta do somethin to keep this from happening so often
5338 2018-02-22 05:56:12 The time to ACT is now, before students are in danger. The ACTION to take:
- pass comprehensive universal background checks
- maintain restrictions on silencers, restrict high capacity magazines, bump stocks 2
- pass red flag laws to preemptively disarm dangerous individuals
5339 2018-02-22 05:55:12 Man, the proposal for the banning of pump stocks and that kick ass Pizza Hut commercial are the positive things I can feel towards you. A shame it took so a bunch of a dead kids before you did anything halfway decent. #CantWaitToBeBlockedByAPresident
5340 2018-02-22 05:53:53 Make sure the AR-15 and other guns with similar abilities are all on it, along with bump stocks and other addons.
5341 2018-02-22 05:53:46 Oh, by the way- who really benefits from Trump’s demented “arming of teachers” idea- the NRA- more gun sales of semi automatics, bump stocks etc.  NRA gave Trump $30.3 million in 2016 campaign- will probably increase for 2020 since he is pushing NRA agenda!
5342 2018-02-22 05:53:39 The part where he argues that it's no good for hunting? Or the part about all the great accessories (eg high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc) that are available for it? 

That's all very interesting. And all good reasons it should be banned.
5343 2018-02-22 05:53:36 I was glad that there is an auto import to TurboTax from Robinhood because I was scared that taxes for stocks are complicated. Then I realized it is only like 3 lines and it took me longer to get the import to work than if I had just typed it in myself.

5346 2018-02-22 05:52:43 How about come midterm elections we bump GOP stock out of office, then continue on to banning AR-15s, bump stocks, hi cap mags, put MI under restriction (AGAIN) & notifications for more than 50 rounds. 100 is way too many potential targets

5350 2018-02-22 05:49:31 Bump stocks soon to be illegal for all the good it will do  along with digi triggers.
But the technology is still out there. And of course crude belt loops .
5351 2018-02-22 05:49:28 Sir, I commend you for this town hall and taking these direct questions. Please support background checks, raising the age for buying guns, and banning bump stocks, even if this affects your rating/contributions from the NRA.

5353 2018-02-22 05:48:38 Hey the GOP bandaid men are here. Need severe assault weapons bans. The bandaid men will now months after Vegas consider Bump stocks.
5354 2018-02-22 05:47:11 In other words cosmetic treatments that do nothing to make the guns any more lethal. With the exception of bump stocks and trigger mechanisms which affect the rate of fire.
5355 2018-02-22 05:46:48 What rights are you afraid of stripping? No one needs to own assault weapons unless you are in the military. Want one? Join. No one should buy a gun without a background check. Bump stocks should be illegal.
5356 2018-02-22 05:46:48 Those of you who use Sliquid, OzSale currently has it for $12!

(Although we just found out @sexindustrynetw stocks it anyway for the same price)
5357 2018-02-22 05:46:30 Can't control bump stocks cause it's just a technique and can be done with a belt. Magazine size won't make a difference. It takes less than 5 seconds to reload a gun. I agree we need more strenuous background checks with mental tests and whatnot.
5358 2018-02-22 05:45:38 Does he know he can’t get bump stocks from his broker?
5359 2018-02-22 05:45:38 And there are many that are not. No reason to have assault weapons, bump stocks, selling guns to mentally ill.
5360 2018-02-22 05:45:37 No he should not be banning the bump stocks.
5361 2018-02-22 05:44:36 I agree, except bump stocks. They are easily made at home. Banning them would accomplish nothing.
5362 2018-02-22 05:44:25 Many are wiling to listen to real solutions, bump stocks, Red Flag laws, increasing age limits are a start, but there's a lot more to do, including thinking outside the more guns = more security mentality.

5364 2018-02-22 05:44:03 How to stop #schoolshootings without getting rid of guns. 1. Lock down schools to those with a pass. 2. Do not sell automatic or assault guns to anyone under 25. 3. Make bump stocks illegal to the public.
5365 2018-02-22 05:43:58 A number of countries even have negative interest rates meaning it costs you interest to store money in the bank.  The net effect is to treat cash like trash and speculate on assets and stocks...normalizing this process does the opposite
5366 2018-02-22 05:43:22 Or semi with bump stocks. But you're right, I think neither is necessary. And to the other guy saying it's legal: Yes. That's the point. It shouldn't be.
5367 2018-02-22 05:42:44 Do something real ban guns get some real courage. Fight for real change so brave Ban AR 15 and bump stocks.  This bill will save so many lives Lol...I challenge you and your friends in power to make a real difference ban all guns but you won't afraid of losing.
5368 2018-02-22 05:42:28 Tell me again why we need to ban bump stocks. For that matter, repeal the NFA. I should be able to own a machine gun as a law abiding citizen!

"unless you outlaw all guns...no dent" : Nope.
For example, fully automatic weapons are outlawed.  Undoubtedly, this has saved lives.  If bump stocks had been outlawed in Vegas would have saved some.
5372 2018-02-22 05:40:43 Don't understand how trump can consider banning bump stocks yet not consider banning AR15 assault weapons. Does that make sense?
5373 2018-02-22 05:40:07 Also limit clip sizes. No bump stocks. Things we can actually agree on.
5374 2018-02-22 05:39:19 You all lie that we need assault weapons. You won't give a millimeter to protect kids. Refused to let your guys ban even bump stocks in Congress. This country is completely corrupted by money and your power. Reasonable people are starting to hate y'all.
5375 2018-02-22 05:38:51 Doing nothing? Bump stocks are on the chopping block, stricter background checks are being kicked around, even suggestions of allowing CCW permitted teachers to have their weapons, etc.

There are options out there but liberals only have one goal and it's to repeal the #2A.
5376 2018-02-22 05:37:57 Pathetic. Automatic weapons have been banned since the prohibition era. Even the bump stock inventor thought they were illegal. ATF was expected to rule them illegal. So now we are saying automatic weapons with bump stocks are really really illegal. Pathetic.
5377 2018-02-22 05:37:36 @dhirendra_vr . Surprised to see that you dont have exposure to individual stocks . Inspired to see that you walk the talk. any thoughts ?
5378 2018-02-22 05:37:28 Get rid of assault weapons, outlaw them and buy them all back like Australia did, and institute UNIVERSAL gun checks!  It’s BULLSHIT talking about bump stocks. I’m pro 2nd ammendment but not for weapons that inflict mayhem on a body. I voted for you but am very disappointed.
5379 2018-02-22 05:37:18 That is true,  But an AR15 only shoots 1 bullet at a time like a handgun. What happens is ppl add on bump stocks. I think Trump is about to ban those! Have a good evening.
5380 2018-02-22 05:37:08 I’d ask them to do it again tomoro & the next day & the next. These asshat Senators are not leaders & deserve to be lectured & ridiculed.. and put in stocks in the town square with free tomatoes for all citizens to throw at them.
5381 2018-02-22 05:35:34 It doesn't take long to reload a gun so that's not even an argument. Bump stocks can be made out of your belt so it's not like some tool you buy. And in the 2nd amendment it gives you your reason for guns. Sure. Make it even more strenuous to get a gun (cont)

And AR-15 style rifles aren't designed for military use the same way bb guns arent designed for home defense. Stop equating the two
5394 2018-02-22 05:31:45 U haven’t demanded that bump stocks be eliminated;or raise minimum age to own a gun (NRA opposes raising the age); won’t outlaw semi-automatic weapons (NRA opposes).

5397 2018-02-22 05:30:45 What don't you understand about being for common sense gun legislation doesn't mean coming after all your guns? E.g. universal background checks, improve accuracy of data bases, banning bump stocks & weapons designed for maximum carnage such as AR-15.
5398 2018-02-22 05:29:43 Bless the stocks
5399 2018-02-22 05:29:39 A school should be a place where students and teachers feel safe. We can’t stop all dangers but we can work to reduce them. Universal background checks would be a fantastic start. Limit or eliminate high capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks.
5400 2018-02-22 05:29:31 More deaths is a great marketing strategy for selling schools security equipment and services. I expect killings and security stocks shall strangely go up - together.
5401 2018-02-22 05:29:10 Before 2004 semiautomatic guns were banned. Chris was correct. Laws change. Interpretations change. Time to ban semi-automatic and bump stocks and hollow or specialized bullets! #NeverAgain
5402 2018-02-22 05:29:06 Those kids are just left wing pawns. You should have left them in Parkland. No gun reform. Bump stocks had nothing to do with this. Its a mental illness issue and an FBI failure.

5415 2018-02-22 05:25:01 There were a few productive points such as raising the buying age of rifles to 21 (which the NRA didnt suport) and the banning of bump stocks (which they do) to name a couple

But CNN should not be proud of what went on tonight, not at all
5416 2018-02-22 05:25:00 This much is clear: we need comprehensive background checks and bans on high-capacity magazines, assault rifles, and bump stocks that are used to create machine guns. Inaction is not an option. Are you with me?
5417 2018-02-22 05:24:45 Currently, some 90 percent of fish stocks are fully fished, overfished, depleted or recovering globally.

5422 2018-02-22 05:23:07 Finally some USA movement on guns  . #Trump at least listened, signed a memo on bump stocks but arming teachers will only make them first targets. For #neveragain to succeed, start now with lifting age limits and limiting magazine sizes. Take it up to the #NRA.  @auspol @BBC @CNN
5423 2018-02-22 05:23:04 We need realistic goals. Handguns have too strong a case to be made in self-defense. Banning assault weapons and having much tougher standards to buy guns, taxing bullets and banning things like bump stocks and large mags are much more likely to get passed into law.
5424 2018-02-22 05:23:03 Thats like throwing pennies to a poor man. Do something with substance. Ban assault rifles. Ban silencers. Ban bump stocks. Then raise the age limit.
5425 2018-02-22 05:22:48 Yes this is true, but this is about consolidating and fortifying positions. Bump-stocks isnt the hill to die on. I know the "it doesnt stop there" part, but this is probably a smart move. Fight from the high ground. Bump stocks arent high ground.
5426 2018-02-22 05:22:44 I am going to guess that gun sales are now through the roof. Time to look at my stocks and reinvest.
5427 2018-02-22 05:22:42 @realDonaldTrump.  Are you kidding me?  You want teachers to have guns?  That’s ridiculous!  You need to restrain guns, not add more guns!  You just want to make the NRA happy & get more money from them.  The other ideas are good.  The ban on bump stocks & extended bullet cases.

5429 2018-02-22 05:21:44 I stay take all the measures anyway.... every single one.  ban the AR-15, etc, the bump stocks; tighten background system; no guns if history of domestic violence; mentally ill shouldn't get guns.  all of it!
5430 2018-02-22 05:21:19 Only bump stocks from Trump.
5431 2018-02-22 05:21:02 I got into stocks, this shit goat
5432 2018-02-22 05:20:32 I'm all in for sensible gun legislation, but I'm not for replicating the aussie system. The all or nothing approach is not good. Ban bump stocks, ban people with histories of domestic abuse, terrorist watch list individuals and those with major to extreme mental instability.
5433 2018-02-22 05:20:21 Is any one into stocks? Trading and buying? What’s your opinion on it?
5434 2018-02-22 05:19:52 Everybody, please check out the gun laws for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the 49 states can adopt: full background checks, waiting period, license required, gun safety course, banned bump stocks, register all guns, other 49 states??
5435 2018-02-22 05:18:19 This is especially immoral when you fail to pass laws to ensure that the teachers you want to send into the halls of a massacre never have to face off with an ar-15 or semi automatic rifle. All for no bump stocks but let's not stop there.
5436 2018-02-22 05:17:51 Donald is busy with bump stocks, raising the rifle owners age to 21 and training public school teachers to handle firearms safely 
5437 2018-02-22 05:17:50 Did u notice that those stocks wwre almost 2-3 percent up during the day then dropped like 2 percent
5438 2018-02-22 05:17:43 Why didn’t he support banning bump stocks after LV? Because NRA $$$$$$
5439 2018-02-22 05:16:49 We need better background checks.
We need semi-automatic weapons out of the hands of private citizens.
We need a ban on bump stocks.
We need school psychologists in every school.
We need therapists to be legally able to report suspicious behavior to police.

5442 2018-02-22 05:15:45 The gunman in Las Vegas had no history of mental health issues. Could buy 720 rounds in one purchase. Amass an arsenal of weapons unfettered. No actions taken to address bump stocks (no DOJ opinion or floor vote). 58 dead. 800+ injured. #DidNothing
5443 2018-02-22 05:15:45 The President's Day sale code for 10% off bump stocks from the Texas manufacturer was "MAGA". No joke. That really happened.
5444 2018-02-22 05:15:39 After bump stocks are banned it’s time to go after binary triggers and the cam fire systems for guns like M2HB semi autos.
5445 2018-02-22 05:15:26 Its nothing to ban a tiny tiny part of gun related parts just to make it look like hes doing something.
Banning bump stocks is NOTHING please dont commend anything less than serious gun control.
Your a nice guy hes garbage..
5446 2018-02-22 05:15:18 Then why did she lie about the @NRA's stance on background checks and bump stocks?
5447 2018-02-22 05:15:12 ... i cant give you stocks soojungie, i cant even eat my own chocolates (ToT)
5448 2018-02-22 05:14:23 To be fair, @DLoesch lied about the NRA and their stance on both background checks and bump stocks. They are against any legislation that strengthens or expands background checks and did not support legislation that would make bump stocks illegal. But at least she lied in person.
5449 2018-02-22 05:14:04 Ils ont prit des photos de ce qu'ils veulent chez toi. Derrière ils mettent ça sur le bon coin ou autre. Dès qu'ils ont un acheteur, ils reviennent. Ça leur évite les stocks. Désolé mais tu n'es pas sorti d'affaire. surtout si ils ont bourré ta maison de micros et caméras.
5450 2018-02-22 05:13:42 It seems this country really wants to be run on emotions rather than common sense. I just don't see how these students are yelling about bum stocks while millions of fetuses are being aborted each year and they stay quiet!

#StudentsStandUp #StudentsDemandAction #RealTalk
5451 2018-02-22 05:13:18 The typical NRA insanity...more guns, which is ASININE! BAN the assault rifles! BAN the bump stocks! ENFORCE background checks! Do NOT sell to minors! Crack down on non-compliant gun sellers! Enforce the laws and PROSECUTE those who violate!
5452 2018-02-22 05:13:14 Some stocks are dumped on the basis of bad industry prospects without considering how bad the prospects actually are.
A new pond for fishing is emerging after long…
5453 2018-02-22 05:13:11 Very glad @marcorubio showed up to the CNN town hall, takes guts and signals willingness for change. Just hope he meant what he said about raising age of buying gun, univ background checks, and most importantly ban high-capacity magazines/bump stocks
5454 2018-02-22 05:13:10 HEGEMON FACTION stocks slump
5455 2018-02-22 05:13:08 @realDonaldTrump Hi Donald.  That's tremendous news what you have announced.  With the bump stocks first,  then as I said, you need to keep guns out of the hands of fucktards like the Vegas shooter, and the school shooter.
5456 2018-02-22 05:12:55 When Trump ordered the DoJ to get rid of bump stocks, it was just a stalling tactic and he knows it!
5457 2018-02-22 05:12:47 Meanwhile at the White House:
Let's ban bump stocks 
Wow good step
And look into background checks
This is very encouraging
And arm teachers
Ah there he is

5459 2018-02-22 05:12:27 Ok, I love the kids. Now I need to say real shit too.

Republicans are playing us. The NRA is playing us.

They are guiding this debate towards the next low-ball offer.

We will get bump stocks. And it will stall.

The air will have run out of our balloon.
5460 2018-02-22 05:12:16 There’s no reason for Bump Stocks. The reason they were invented was a farce just to make a semi-Auto full Auto. But I’m not too convinced that limiting 5 round mags will make any difference. And are you saying just for rifles?
5461 2018-02-22 05:11:55 I think it’s relatively infeasible to ban or confiscate all civilian firearms, but are you opposed to stricter laws on gun ownership and perhaps outlawing some weapons/equipment, i.e. AR-15’s, bump-stocks, high-capacity magazines?
5462 2018-02-22 05:11:37 Be wary on all private hospital stocks. There's a lot of talk of news about unethical profiteering on TV. A negative perception is being created and if government acts, it can lead to a substantial fall in hospital stock prices.
5463 2018-02-22 05:11:36 BAN assault weapons.  BAN bump stocks.  BAN large magazines. If you were actually listening...you would NOT suggest MORE guns in schools!!!! Did you really hear them like you had to remind yourself to say by carrying notes? I don't think you did.
5464 2018-02-22 05:11:17 You all got Dana Loesch so shook she’s lying about wanting to ban bump stocks, lying about wanting to do background checks, trying to blame everyone but the NRA for mass shootings, and constantly talking about mental health as if she’s not a gun nut.
5465 2018-02-22 05:11:15 I believe the gun used in Florida was a semi-automatic assault rifle without bump stocks. If you’re going to criticize someone, at least have your facts straight. Lieu didn’t say it was a fully automatic rifle.
5466 2018-02-22 05:10:50 30 day wait time

Stop all companies from making campaign donations!
5467 2018-02-22 05:10:05 I said it before and I'll say it again "Trump cares more about stock bumps than bump stocks" and it's still true but now he is trying to save his "presidency"  I am glad things are hopefully going to change for the better (safer) but he is still transparent scum
5468 2018-02-22 05:09:53 I know that the 7-11 I frequent stocks both.
5469 2018-02-22 05:09:45 Sure.Those that own them now will not be required to turn them in. They were not required in the last ban in 1994. AND the criminal. He doesnt give a flying rip about your restriction.
BY the way gun shops are running out of AR15s because of fear a ban. My stocks thanks u.
5470 2018-02-22 05:09:44 3 sides to the school shooting discussion

1. Ban AR15 & bump stocks

2. More gun control through increased regulations

3. Protect the schools & increase or bring mental health help to people that need it

Now which of those actually protects children from school shootings
5471 2018-02-22 05:09:11 After today’s #CNNTownHall I am going to start looking at some arms manufacturing stocks. #GunLaws #2ndAmendment
5472 2018-02-22 05:09:06 If you listen to his actual reply he advocates for banning bump stocks and raising the age for buying weapons. Doesn’t sound so robotic to me. He remained calm and collected while others in the crowd tried to silence him. Need more respectable dialogues like that.
5473 2018-02-22 05:08:43 Perfume list is updated with new stocks! Kindly PM if you are looking for a particular scent. Masyadong mahaba ipost. Thanks

5475 2018-02-22 05:08:34 prohibiting bump stocks is not a progressive 21st century gun control.
5476 2018-02-22 05:08:25 You think existing bump stocks will be grandfathered?
5477 2018-02-22 05:08:21 Yea...anyone pushing for anything more than stricter adherence to laws already on the books, more mental health awareness and maybe bans on things like bump stocks is just going to come across as uneducated or too extreme and drive 2A loving folks further away.
5478 2018-02-22 05:08:14 @cameron_kasky 
Hey Cameron, FYI, Don't let the politicians lead you to believe that they are compromising or going against the NRA when banning bump stocks. NRA doesn't care because they are not manufactured by gunmakers, who they truly represent.
5479 2018-02-22 05:08:14 Feels weird to be agreeing with Trump on something with respect to the bump stocks, but I'll take whatever victory I can get.
5480 2018-02-22 05:07:58 I agree to outlawing bump stocks if...

The patent will be released for Laser Fire AI Neural Weapons for personal use!

Who wants those nasty fingerprints and casings at the scene!

#ThinkGreen
5481 2018-02-22 05:07:53 But does this mean you favor reinstating the ban on assault weapons with high velocity magazines and bump stocks?
5482 2018-02-22 05:07:42 Really sorry, we will be getting no further stocks.
5483 2018-02-22 05:07:34 I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock and  there’s only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing  poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies. 
~ Peter  Lynch
5484 2018-02-22 05:07:30 Bump Stocks! Makes an AR-15 an assault rifle — and there’s other ways to modify this weapon from Semi to Auto.  Get a grip... on reality. The 2nd Amendment is about organized Militia. Not individuals as lone wolf’s.
5485 2018-02-22 05:06:06 No of course not. I'm not suggesting taking away guns from law abiding citizens that own guns legally at all. This is about moving forward. Common sense laws like stricter background checks, removing sales of guns such as AR15s, ban bump stocks etc. Something better than nothing
5486 2018-02-22 05:05:53 @WeissRatings stick to stocks; your credibility will be ruined in the crypto space.  Your research here is amateur at best and it’s clear that you understanding of the technology is lacking.
5487 2018-02-22 05:05:20 Stocks reversed gains and bond yields rose after the minutes revealed a more hawkish posture among Fed officials. The S&P 500 Index ended the day down 0.6 percent after being up as much as 1.2 percent earlier. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose to 2.94 percent  a four-year high

5489 2018-02-22 05:04:47 “What is YOUR position on making AR15s illegal and making modifications to guns such as bump stocks illegal”
5490 2018-02-22 05:04:09 The USA ladies are going to need bump stocks on their hockey sticks to stop us now #USAvsCAN #GoldMedalGame #GoCanadaGo
5491 2018-02-22 05:03:51 Bump stocks must be an absolute money-losing venture for gun manufacturers for the Republicans and the NRA to offer them up so readily. 
It's probably like Sears closing K-Mart stores to answer concerns about big box stores. They weren't making money anyway, so no big loss.
5492 2018-02-22 05:03:30 What can Americans  do about Gun violence? Bump stocks, magazine size. Fuck it Get rid of the millions of firearms, PROBLEM SOLVED!! Stop these hand guns from illegaly crossing the border into my country Canada . End the insanity Now!!! #CNNTownHall
5493 2018-02-22 05:03:14 And when gun stocks go down, NRA riles up Americans, buy guns, stocks go back up. And again, and again...
5494 2018-02-22 05:03:12 I listened to the whole thing. This line, and her false platitudes of “I’m so sorry for your loss” were her go-to responses instead of answering direct questions. She was asked HER position on removing AR15s from public sale and making bump stocks illegal. No direct answer.
5495 2018-02-22 05:02:44 No, I don't think guns should be taken away from law abiding citizens. I don't think anybody needs an assault weapon! Ban assault weapons & bump stocks. They are involved in all the mass shootings.
5496 2018-02-22 05:01:51 Shadow Trigger = double action.  Bump stocks increase as well. Both are a good starting point for things to prohibit.  Congress was trying on bump socks, but they needed a bill with guns in it, they can't be their own thing (it's a rule apparently), and then it died.
5497 2018-02-22 05:01:43 Close down gun show sales; extensive background checks; (it takes 6 wks background checks for my co. to hire salespeople for rental furniture). No mail order gun sales; no semi-automatic weapon sales. NO  bump stocks; no 500 MAG ammo. Life imprisonment laws for offenders.
5498 2018-02-22 05:01:28 Assault rifles are not for hunting. They are weapons of war.  I want to see a ban on personal ownership of assault rifles, bump stocks and large magazines. An extended waiting period, mandatory background checks, & raise the age limit. To start with.
5499 2018-02-22 05:01:17 Right. I'll give up bump stocks and limit mags to 5 rounds.
5500 2018-02-22 05:01:14 Makes sense to me, too. I'm afraid the WH/GOP will try to get away with doing the smallest thing, like banning bump stocks. We can't let that happen to Parkland families & millions of others who suffer because  (mostly) men use guns to kill. They use it for suicide, too.
5501 2018-02-22 05:00:54 The NRA proposed armed guards in every school after Sandy Hook and have askes the ATF to reclassify bump stocks so they can be more easily banned.

That said, they’re wrong on universal background checks.
5502 2018-02-22 05:00:29 The liberal side argues (justifiably) for degrees of safety improvement all the time. Banning bump stocks, better mental health treatment: "It won't stop all the problems, but if it saves only one life...".  Well many conservatives argue giving teachers guns may save some lives.
5503 2018-02-22 05:00:02 What’s crazy to me is that she was proving the point for how better background checks aren’t enough on their own. We need to ban purchases under 21, ban bump stocks, & end straw man purchases by making the application process much more involved just as a starting point.
5504 2018-02-22 04:59:51 The NRA has opposed banning sale to people on no-fly lists, people who are mentally ill, waiting periods, background checks, banning bump stocks, I mean really for him to talk about they support his agenda? Then his agenda is nothing but more guns, more shootings & more corpses.
5505 2018-02-22 04:59:46 Understandable. That's why we should ban bump stocks and other modifications as the NRA and Trump have proposed.

5509 2018-02-22 04:59:15 Vegas is a false equivalency mate thats like saying trucks should be banned because Nice, France you know the asshole killed and injured more than the vegas shooter? Also didn't Trump just sign a bill banning bump stocks? As for Parkland you're making my argument for me mate
5510 2018-02-22 04:59:07 There was common ground after Las Vegas on bump stocks.  It was a done deal.  Then Democratic overreach killed it.  There is common ground now, purchase age, background reporting, rapid extreme threat injunctions.  Overreach can kill that too.  Go ahead, go for all semi-autos.
5511 2018-02-22 04:57:57 @HedgeyeIndstrls I want to thank #hedgegaming guy for saying don’t invest in these stocks few years back. I’m happy I ignored him $lvs
5512 2018-02-22 04:57:48 ban bump stocks.

Give oweners 6 months to turn them in. If they are caught after the turn in period they will loose all rights to own any guns.

I think they will turn in the bump stocks to keep their other guns.

If not NO GUNS FOR YOU

@SenSchumer
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats
5513 2018-02-22 04:57:09 Or they could work to force our CA guns on FL:
Gun violence restraining orders
10 day waiting period
all guns : limit 10 rounds/mag
(new) bg check on ammo buys
 (old) bump stocks illegal since 1990
Not perfect but a start.
5514 2018-02-22 04:56:48 Yes its the nra and their money not the politicians for taking the money. I wonder if any dems own stocks in any gun manufacturers? They made a killing over the past 8 years.
5515 2018-02-22 04:56:38 Have stopped watching CNBC. Nothing but talking robot cheerleaders for stocks the shills are vested in. Now just keep Bloomberg in the TV bkd. Plus (pardon the sexism) Vonnie Quinn and Julia Chatterly are smarter and prettier than any of the female CNBC duds .  Lol
5516 2018-02-22 04:56:23 The Vegas shooting was four months ago. The bump stocks are *still* legal. Every reasonable person in this country knows what needs to be done.
5517 2018-02-22 04:56:18 Theres nothing else like a bump stock though. All "devices" isn't just bump stocks. I've said it since this happened,while debating or arguing with people. It comes down to semantics,when dealing with a law. Especially changing or creating one

5519 2018-02-22 04:55:44 @Emma4Change I like what you all said at tonight’s CNN forum.  I wish you guys had mentioned that Trump took 30 million from the NRA. I wish you mentioned that Vegas was in October and bump stocks are just now talked about again
5520 2018-02-22 04:55:26 Don’t be an ass Tony. Trump has put into motion several measures that will help to limit the carnage such as A) increasing the age one can buy a gun and B) banning of bump stocks. Relax, sir. Life is going to be just fine without your assholery.
5521 2018-02-22 04:55:24 Instead of this why do the big banks not offer access to shares to low income earners? Unless you have a checking account with STD Bnk or open a trading account, access to shares is non existent.
Banks need to train clients and new clients on stocks, bonds equity
5522 2018-02-22 04:55:24 So Dad - who in Washington as come up with legislation that you approve of? OH no one. So changing the age to 21, improved  background checks (including mental health), more security at the schools and outlawing bump stocks is weak. Your confused.
5523 2018-02-22 04:55:23 #MarchForOurLives So, just supporting raising the minimum age to 21 actually means: that 21 year old can buy a gun FOR an 17 or 18 year old who is still in high school. If bump stocks are not outlawed then that 17 or 18 year old can also get one of those with his assault rifle.

Give up your bump stocks within 6 months or risk having all your guns stripped form you.

5527 2018-02-22 04:54:36 Ok that’s better because an actual modification requires a Class 3 license which is VERY difficult to obtain. On to bump stocks, I agree get rid of em there is no reason to have them. Good thing President Trump is going to make them illegal.

5529 2018-02-22 04:54:20 This insanity needs to stop. Any one invoking the 2nd amendment as a way to stop change is completely wrong. Do you really think the founding fathers had AR-15’s with bump stocks & Americans  being massacred in the streets, churches, concerts, airports, etc by other Americans???
5530 2018-02-22 04:54:19 The gun show loophole, bump stocks, the lack of adequate background checks. The mere fact that Cruz was able to obtain a gun is disturbing, that a person on the no-fly list can still obtain a gun. Trust me, I don’t like government overeach, but this is necessary.
5531 2018-02-22 04:54:16 My point is that your statement that the NRA asked Obama to regulate bump stocks was factually incorrect.
5532 2018-02-22 04:53:58 Except Dana lied and/or misrepresented the NRA position on bump stocks,  background checks, and the mentally ill.     Lets be real please.    She showed empathy and concern but also gaslit victims of a mass school shooting.
5533 2018-02-22 04:53:46 just one off the top of my head is she didnt answer the direct question about whether she thinks it should be harder to obtain semi auto rifles, she skipped that and repeated the nra position that she thought bump stocks should be banned.
5534 2018-02-22 04:53:23 See, what you see as a compromise on bump stocks, I see as common-sense and a no-brainer. But I realize that we disagree on this, and we probably aren’t changing each other’s mind on this and other gun policy issues.
5535 2018-02-22 04:53:20 Except Dana lied and/or misrepresented the NRA position on bump stocks,  background checks, and the mentally ill.     Lets be real please.    She showed empathy and concern but also gaslit victims of a mass school shooting.
5536 2018-02-22 04:53:01 Need to ban ALL semi-automatic weapons. Also need to ban any accessories that change a weapon from semi-automatic to fully automatic (bump stocks for example).
5537 2018-02-22 04:52:59 My MJ stock list showed 19 up and 31 down out of 55 stocks.  Not a good day in general for MJ's.  Some of the stocks on my list are Canadian MJ's just to let everyone know....less than 10 however.
5538 2018-02-22 04:52:45 Bump stocks are absolutely ridiculous and I'm glad Trump is at least addressing those.
5539 2018-02-22 04:52:43 I applaud @SenFeinstein for trying to raise the age required to purchase a rifle, but this is nothing short of putting a bandaid on a gushing artery. We demand a ban on bump stocks, assault rifles, & all semi-auto weapons.

#GunControlNow

5540 2018-02-22 04:52:41 Banning won't solve it, it'll drive the demand for them higher.  But setting a responsible age limit,  detailed back round checks(shouldn't be able to walk out of the store the same day). Bump stocks are completely unnecessary and so is owning military grade guns.
5541 2018-02-22 04:52:21 No bump stocks, universal background checks, disqualification for mental infirmity, age restrictions on semi-autos, magazine capacity limits
5542 2018-02-22 04:51:47 Use CC’s bro and download some gfx packs for stocks
5543 2018-02-22 04:51:45 Villar stocks up. I got one.
5544 2018-02-22 04:51:18 Also, I don’t know what you mean by assault weapon. Just the AR-15? all semi autos? hand guns? But I will agree with you on the banning of the bump stocks.
5545 2018-02-22 04:51:14 Trump has directed the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations that would ban bump stocks.

Trump said Tuesday has has signed a memo that directs the Justice Department to propose the regulations, which would “ban all devices” like bump stocks
5546 2018-02-22 04:50:49 the reason behind is no one amongst the resort owners wants to share stocks with the current political leadership. subukan.nyo.magshare, mananahimik sila. lol
5547 2018-02-22 04:50:41 The NRA does not support banning bump stocks or background check, she suggested they did. Gun violence makes domestic violence worse, not better. Obama did not gut gun safety regulations. 18th century weaponry is not the same as the guns of today.
5548 2018-02-22 04:50:33 Let's all go buy more  badass guns,bump stocks and ammo.Then we can decide who is the good guy. It will be like the wild west with auto-loaders dropping innocents in the line of fire.And maybe we could get some hand held rocket launchers too.
My point is
What's the cut off point?
5549 2018-02-22 04:50:30 Recreation...fun. same value people get from alcohol I guess. Should these be regulated? Yes, but you aren't arguing regulating semi-auto rifles... You're arguing eliminating them. I'll give you banning bump stocks and high capacity mags. That's good regulation.

5552 2018-02-22 04:48:52 I was wishing someone would have asked her whether the NRA would support a single new gun law. Clearly still no. Just bashing local law enforcement for not doing what they had no authority to do and asking the ATF to futilely look at bump stocks again.
5553 2018-02-22 04:48:47 Talk to me about raising the age limit, or doing away with bump stocks, or more intense background check I would agree., but guns alone no way.
5554 2018-02-22 04:48:43 The NRA fought banning gun sales to the mentally ill. They fought banning gun sales to people on no fly lists. They fought banning bump stocks after the Vegas massacre, they oppose age limits & any attempt to find a solution. They have enabled every mass shooter.

#NRABloodMoney
5555 2018-02-22 04:48:30 Mag capacity is a moot point as it makes no difference and bump stocks won’t stop bump firing as it can be accomplished with a belt loop or a rubber band.
5556 2018-02-22 04:48:23 isn't it funny how the only time u do due diligence and research on a stock u are trading is when u are stuck?! #stocks $SVXY
5557 2018-02-22 04:48:10 Lets ban bump stocks because no one can use there finger. Also if we ban large clips no one can carry 6 6 shooters or they can,t drive a car into a crowd, & no one can use a pressure cooker. GENIUS.
5558 2018-02-22 04:47:51 If I had extra cash, I'd buy stocks in guns tonight.
5559 2018-02-22 04:47:48 I hope her husband is listening and stocks up on Benadryl to knock her ass out when she’s home.
5560 2018-02-22 04:47:47 Why don’t you dems revisit the federalization of mental health during the Kennedy administration. You know, the point at which all this began. GUNS (bump stocks or suppressors) ARE NOT THE PROBLEM!! How do you not get that? It’s the people....
5561 2018-02-22 04:47:40 Something meaningless like banning bump stocks, and something dangerous like arming teachers so gun manufacturers get more money. That will be their Houdini trick.
5562 2018-02-22 04:47:39 It's not the time?
#ItsTime
To talk about gun control
#ItsTime To talk about Mental health
It's time to talk about bump stocks

It's time. It's time
5563 2018-02-22 04:46:54 @SenRubioPress @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews any acceptance of NRA money will end your political career. Vote higher ages for purchase, no bump stocks, no assault rifles, no large capacity clips! This would be a minimum action. Some of these we have had before.
5564 2018-02-22 04:46:49 Nagpapaubos na lang po ng stocks. 3in1 and 2in1 Korean bag for only 150 php. Pm me to order! 
5565 2018-02-22 04:46:37 When you play ball against the NRA, you can’t go for downs. You have to go for a TD with every drive. They wouldn’t even let a vote go up j fucking bump stocks.
5566 2018-02-22 04:46:36 Stocks are ready!  Paunahan lang po. 26pcs. Onhand 
Meet up later po. PM nio ako.
5567 2018-02-22 04:46:26 There are many changes that are not complex. Ban bump stocks, require background checks & gun licenses, close gun show loop holes, don’t allow mentally ill w/ violent tendencies to purchase guns, take military-style guns off market. This last shooting should never have happened.
5568 2018-02-22 04:46:22 Universal Background Check
Ban Assault Rifles
Link Federal and State Datbases
Ban High Capacity Magazines
Ban Bump Stocks
5569 2018-02-22 04:46:16 I didn’t appreciate how the moderator kept having to “calm down” the crowd, but it did at least seem like part of the crowd was receptive to Rubio’s ideas on bump stocks, age restrictions, etc. Dana got an extremely negative reaction though.
5570 2018-02-22 04:46:06 But again you’re missing the point. Bump stocks would not be a point of discussion if the guns didn’t get into the hands of mentally unstable people
5571 2018-02-22 04:46:04 7-11 stocks would sky rocket
5572 2018-02-22 04:45:55 Banning is lazy and dumb. Superfluous legislation is dumb. High capacity magazines, and even bump stocks, I'd imagine, are a lot of fun at the range. Why shouldn't I be able to have one, if I want?
5573 2018-02-22 04:45:17 Then DO something!
5574 2018-02-22 04:45:16 But they’re Caucasians! TOTALLY different!
5575 2018-02-22 04:45:16 Now Trump & NRA are doing the same to appease the Dems giving away our right to own bump stocks falling for it again fool me twice!! Shame!!
5576 2018-02-22 04:45:14 He’s NOT!
5577 2018-02-22 04:44:52 The Left think this is comical. It's just a matter of time before  the stocks are worthless after most of us leave for a better platform.
5578 2018-02-22 04:44:49 President Trump endorsed a ban on bump stocks
Which is like removing a pebble from a quarry of rocks.
It’s time the truth we face
Our gun culture is a disgrace

5583 2018-02-22 04:44:01 Didn't they also make promises about bump stocks after Las Vegas and then waited for the furor to die down? They'll drag their feet until the kids go home and we prepare for the next school shooting.
5584 2018-02-22 04:43:53 I'd be happy if she'd pointed out bump stocks don't make guns full auto.
5585 2018-02-22 04:43:52 The problems you have with gun control advocates I get but there is this.

Gun rights advocates: We do care but btw stop trying to take away our bump stocks.
5586 2018-02-22 04:42:58 Which stocks is good to buy(good management)  for long term view at current level please reply???
5587 2018-02-22 04:42:57 Let's ban sale of bump stocks & any magazines over 15 rounds, but then let's enforce immigration laws.
5588 2018-02-22 04:42:53 looked at all of your posts on the Elite thread for the past week. To  me  they show  you've  narrowed your focus to the leading  major indices and leading stocks within them. Bravo. Imo forget  TSLA for this thread...it's not in the sweet spot of what your followers care about.
5589 2018-02-22 04:42:42 There is merit to both sides of his stance tho? He wants to tighten background checks and wants to up the Age to purchase and wants to ban bump stocks. He also wants to protect some of the 2nd amendment. Like I said, middle ground
5590 2018-02-22 04:42:31 Yeah, u couldn't even remember to act kind w/out a cheat sheet. That u even had to hv a "listening session" to hear some of these ideas, like eliminating bump stocks, is shameful. Little wonder historians ALREADY rank u as r worst president ever. You're a joke, dude. A bad joke.
5591 2018-02-22 04:42:19 Compromise, eh Joe? Like agreeing to ban bump-stocks, high capacity magazines and military-style asssult rifles? Or comprehensive background checks on all gun sales? Do go on...
5592 2018-02-22 04:42:11 i actually really admire marco rubio for actually showing up to the town hall, a lot of politicians wouldn't have the guts to do that, and he has actually said he is reconsidering somethings mainly bump stocks and high capacity magazines but its a start, i hope he follows through
5593 2018-02-22 04:41:58 The first two are inconsequential. Very few have bump stocks, & they make the weapon wildly inaccurate, but ban them. Who cares? It has been proven that a determined, well-practiced shooter can put just as many rounds downrange with lower capacity magazines.
5594 2018-02-22 04:41:15 Trump yesterday, "ban bump stocks and apply more stringent regulations"
*People with deep pockets talk to trump*
Trump today, "arm teachers (so the people paying me money can make more money)"
5595 2018-02-22 04:40:49 That f’ng Dana claimed the NRA was all for banning bump stocks except they sure as heck weren’t.
5596 2018-02-22 04:40:35 Ball has been spiked on the 20 yard line... again.  Gotta do more than talk.  Obama didn't do sheet for 8 years.  Didn't even bother to ban bump stocks.
5597 2018-02-22 04:40:35 Call it what it is @senorrinhatch it's MURDER in schools. We'll take all those, but  more: No more #nRA money. No to arming teachers or staff; they're there to teach/mentor.  Background checks. No bump stocks. #Parkland @Emma4Change @cameron_kasky & their classmates demand action
5598 2018-02-22 04:40:24 Politically, Trump will ban the bump stocks and raise the age limit on assault weapons to 21. That gives him the talking point of saying he did something about it.  He’s not strong enough to dig his heels in on this.
5599 2018-02-22 04:40:21 We banned them once, sort of, in 94.

Pretty sure all the top tier operators would lose interest without fancy collapsible stocks and only ten round mags.  Might be a good thing.
5600 2018-02-22 04:40:19 How will you do that?  Banning bump stocks all?  We?  You must not let them down. This is not a new problem. You have done nothing.
5601 2018-02-22 04:39:52 We'll believe you've listened when you repudiate the NRA, stop taking their money and sign an executive order that bans assault weapons, high capacity cartridges, and bump stocks. Looking forward to new young voters who  also know you're incapable of listening.
5602 2018-02-22 04:39:32 Wut? That makes zero sense. Gas stocks don’t drive gas prices. Supply and demand of gas drives gas prices.  Just attack the guy for his stupidity, but leave a separate discussion out of it.
5603 2018-02-22 04:39:27 Like I said earlier, you need to educate yourself. Did you know that Mr. Trump has already presented a bill to ban bump stocks?
5604 2018-02-22 04:39:17 What a talent. Can you bump fire at the rate those stocks get you at?  Post a video
5605 2018-02-22 04:39:09 Stringer Bell dropping all of his cell phone stocks in season 2 of The Wire cus he thinks they can't sell anymore phones is hilarious. Dumbest investor ever.
5606 2018-02-22 04:39:08 @realDonaldTrump Banning Bump Stocks was a HUGE mistake, you will lose most of the supporters who voted for you during your first term. If you wanted to stop students from buying guns a better solution would have been to increase the age to buy guns to 21-25.
5607 2018-02-22 04:39:08 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
5608 2018-02-22 04:38:58 why can t Mr. POTUS, give an explanation why he can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”- Thank you!  U Rubio take money from the NRA...we are against U!!!!

5613 2018-02-22 04:38:15 It's fact, not semantics at all. And what part of "I see no need for bump stocks, they should not be on the market" Don't you understand?
5614 2018-02-22 04:37:54 @Emma4Change great job tonight. The atf does not regulate guns or bump stocks, congress does. She pivoted & bs'd you but I saw fear in her eyes. #NeverAgain #StudentsStandUp
5615 2018-02-22 04:37:51 Bump stocks was not used here in this shooting and should have been banned long time ago.
5616 2018-02-22 04:37:45 Anyone who understands physics and has a little mechanical acumen can make a bump stock.  It is a simple device.  That being said most people capable of doing so have better use of their time.  Go ahead and ban bump stocks, its just another ineffective approach to the problem.
5617 2018-02-22 04:37:37 And btw why does anyone need an assault weapon? 
I vote to Ban Assault Weapons and Bump Stocks
5618 2018-02-22 04:37:31 Obama should have done what he could to ban more than bump stocks. He pushed for less rounds in a magazine, but the Republicans controlled Congress. To commend Trump for anything right now is absurd. He wouldn’t hold a town hall with these students. Arming teachers? C’mon man!
5619 2018-02-22 04:37:17 I agree with expanding to universal background checks, increasing the age to buy any semi - or auto capable weapon to 21, getting rid of bump stocks etc. if the dems/ SJWs would stop there fine.  I don’t think they will.

5621 2018-02-22 04:36:49 @RepChrisStewart What is ur position on guns?  Would u vote to ban AR-15, AK-47, all semi-automatic rifles?  Vote to ban bump stocks and all accessories to increase killing-power of semi-auto rifles?  High capacity magazines?  Or, don't u care?  From what I've seen, u don't care.
5622 2018-02-22 04:36:47 If you think banning"bump stocks"will stop the violence,I've got a bridge in Brooklyn I'll sell you cheap. You didn't know anything about bumpstock till it became a talking point for ginning up your base. Feinstein,you're a phoney. Penda,Sui Juris
5623 2018-02-22 04:36:42 I'm seeing a lot more stability in the market. Some stocks could be at the end of this month!! 
5624 2018-02-22 04:36:33 Sure, but think about what this would do for gun sales!  Gun manufacturer stocks would go through the roof!
5625 2018-02-22 04:36:10 Too broad. Should be gas powered semi automatic weapons with military counterparts...that will kill two birds with one stone because you cant add bump stocks to anything else...
5626 2018-02-22 04:36:07 Time to remove the NFA designation on suppressors. I'll trade bump stocks for that. A class action by the hearing impaired under the ADA against the BATFE to remove suppressors from the NFA is long overdue.
5627 2018-02-22 04:36:02 @RamseyShow is now the time to sell individual stocks since the market is at a all time high or sell some and re-invest in mutual funds/Roth?
5628 2018-02-22 04:35:45 They don't value the gun as much as they value the money. The more mass shootings, the more panic of gun bans, the more the stocks go up. Feb 14 SWHC was $10.17/share, Feb 16 $10.91. That's a 7% return in 2 days. If someone had $100,000 invested, they made $7,000 from shooting...
5629 2018-02-22 04:35:23 Can we get one of those up here in the balloon stocks of good old New Hampshire? Probably not…
5630 2018-02-22 04:35:20 Where was the outrage or rallies by democrats/liberals when obama approved the sale of bump stocks? oh yeah.. they didn't give a shit because it was obama and they're hypocrites.
5631 2018-02-22 04:35:06 I’m for gun control laws better background checks/baring mentally ill from owning any guns/banning bump stocks and magazine capacity. I don’t think it’s possible to remove AR15 and the like from people so I support mandatory school security to protect children. I’m a monster.
5632 2018-02-22 04:34:56 “We need to outlaw bump stocks and assault rifles need to be banned!” Assault rifles are already banned and Trump literally just asked Sessions to work on banning bump stocks yesterday. “BUT WE SAID IT LOUDER AND ON TV AND TWITTER TRUMP IS BAD!” 
5633 2018-02-22 04:34:53 Dear Fana Loesch, you have no idea the firestorm you have brought against your beloved NRA. By the way your a lying weasel, OBAMA did not make cuts to gun safety and Trump can’t make any decisions on bump stocks that is the job of Congress.
5634 2018-02-22 04:34:53 Do you give Trump a pass for his EO banning bump stocks and proposing universal background checks?

5636 2018-02-22 04:34:44 If they banned assault weapons they wouldn’t be asking bump stocks! The problem is the guns!
5637 2018-02-22 04:34:38 You don't need an AR-15, you don't need an AR-15 style rifle, you don't need bump stocks, you shouldn't be able to buy an assault rifle at 18, and you don't need large capacity magazines. You need to grow the fuck up. #StudentsStandUp
5638 2018-02-22 04:34:36 The only way the US will have any chance of substantial gun legislation (and I don’t mean more background checks and banning bump stocks) is for the populace to get some balls and vote for those not swayed by the NRA. Get over your god damn 2nd amendment bullshit.
5639 2018-02-22 04:34:26 Dude. The second amendment was written in 1789. Your argument is invalid. Were the founding fathers supposed to predict AR-17s, bump stocks, AK-47s? IT COULD ONLY BE ABOUT OLD, OBSOLETE GUNS.
5640 2018-02-22 04:34:23 If the @NRA is against bump stocks and keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill (which @DLoesch said tonight they are) why are the campaign donations to R’s not contingent on R’s passing bills on these issues? That’s the question that should have been asked.

5645 2018-02-22 04:33:42 The perception from the other side of the argument is that the NRA is all or nothing attitude when it comes to gun control. It's unrealistic to say that we can avoid all mass shootings, but perhaps decrease the loss of life. Perhaps ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines?
5646 2018-02-22 04:33:40 You can hold as many debates as you want but you will never convince me nor the millions of other gun owners to give up their guns. Raise the age to 21. Okay. Ban bumb stocks. Okay. But that’s it.
5647 2018-02-22 04:33:15 The fake ~ 13,000 DOW points that the previous clownshow admin paid $6 Triliion or so for and stuck the US taxpayer with the bill has to be "paid back" soon.

5649 2018-02-22 04:33:04 Of course they will and it had nothing to do with tonight. It's predictable, I'd buy gun stocks as mass shootings we're happening if I didn't have a soul. So I'm sure you've invested big on Feb 14, cashing out anytime soon?

5652 2018-02-22 04:31:48 Can you buy stocks in the NRA?
5653 2018-02-22 04:31:39 Bump Stocks,  they think they are guns.  Really. Ask.
5654 2018-02-22 04:31:09 Not sure u r smarter. Not until u can admit hrc and dems commited crimes and colluded.. both parties are not good. U cant blame trump for everything..i dont like all his policies but economy is good, did just make a demand bump stocks be banned. Give him some credit
5655 2018-02-22 04:30:51 President Trump he had a proposal to ban devices known as bump stocks which let legal semiautomatic rifles firs like fully automatic weapons. Florida lawmakers rejected a motion to bring an assault weapons ban vote Tuesday the house voted 71-36. Its about gun control#ghhsci22118
5656 2018-02-22 04:30:50 7-11 stocks them.
5657 2018-02-22 04:30:44 Kathryn, I'm a NRA life member. They"re are a couple of things about the gun debate which are common sense: 10 round magazines for the AR15 and AK47 and no bump-stocks. As a 18 year-old Marine in Vietnam, I had a 20 round mag for my M16. Tools do kill when used by demented nuts.
5658 2018-02-22 04:30:19 6) Up the age for gun purchases 
7) Ban bump stocks and any other such devices
8) Consider rewording Second Amendment to exclude assault rifles (which are not needed for personal family protection but are instead weapons of war)
5659 2018-02-22 04:30:12 @CNN “speaking truth to power” just after a student says Bump stocks make weapons fully automatic...that is incorrect. Please have your panels check their facts before questioning with the false information
5660 2018-02-22 04:30:10 I was actually talking about the GUN problem. And for that: ban bump stocks, limit or ban high-capacity magazines, no more "assault" rifles, alerts for stockpiling weapons and ammo, no weapons for mentally ill or domestic abusers, univ background checks. As a start.
5661 2018-02-22 04:30:10 Just how much do the @NRA and @GOP have invested in the weapons manufacturing ind. Restrictions on guns just might hurt the Bottom line, Stocks and Bonds, is it money over Children!!
5662 2018-02-22 04:29:49 I really wanted to talk bump stocks all night but this sounds reasonable.  Night.
5663 2018-02-22 04:29:14 CNN all over the fact @DLoesch couldn't say yes or no on bump stocks.
5664 2018-02-22 04:28:51 It will be interesting to follow gun sales in the coming weeks. They are getting some prime advertising that you could not afford to purchase. I think I am going to buy some selected stocks.

Thanks,@CNN
5665 2018-02-22 04:28:49 Semi-automatic is basically the majority of weapons in the modern era. That's just not likely to happen. But doing away with bump stocks is an easy, smart move.
5666 2018-02-22 04:28:43 7th grade my pre-algebra teacher gave an assignment to buy stocks to track for 3 or 4 week period.  My pick was Bershire Hathaway at $2900/share at the time. Fake money of course

Why that pick?  Due to the out-sized numbers it was easy to spot in the newspaper listings
5667 2018-02-22 04:28:38 I have been buying the dead cat bounces on a lot of stocks lately aswell as shorts. $GSW was one I pulled the handbrake up and went in reverse.  Closed out my position early today and will never look at it again.

5669 2018-02-22 04:28:36 Where were they after Vegas? What is #nra position on bump stocks? Where were they after #SandyHook? They were giving #NRABloodMoney to politicians and enabling domestic terrorists. #sad #StudentsStandUp #NeverAgain #VoteThemOut
5670 2018-02-22 04:28:33 Do not trust him though. He will still take NRA money. They'll pass the  bills... Back ground check, age. Hopefully bump stocks. But stay on them. They'll try to let everything else slip through the cracks & more needs to be done. I'm with you! #NeverAgain So proud of all of you
5671 2018-02-22 04:28:27 @marcorubio I saw you on @CNN tonight.
Are you going to keep your word and ban bump stocks? Are you going to vote to raise the age requirement to buy a gun to 21? 
That would be a start.
5672 2018-02-22 04:28:22 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS IDIOT!!! Teachers having guns..... That is ridiculous. Stupidity at its best.. take away bump stocks from NRA then give them teachers with guns.  HMMMM  not to bright
5673 2018-02-22 04:28:08 What other businesses do these gun manufacturers own? Can we start boycotting their subcontractors? Stores selling semi-automatics and bump stocks?
5674 2018-02-22 04:28:05 Anything that high capacity or caliber, not banned but heavily regulated and very difficult to obtain. Bump stocks, should be illegal as that skirts the full auto ban in my opinion.
5675 2018-02-22 04:28:04 It will be a sad day if teachers had to start arming themselves, surely there's got to be some other way besides bump stocks.
5676 2018-02-22 04:27:29 Good point Clyde. Also the right misses the point, banning ARs & bump stocks slow down the rate of death/incident
5677 2018-02-22 04:27:22 @DLoesch If as you say the @NRA & it’s members support a natl database that must be checked, banning bump stocks & keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, then why isn’t the NRA releasing a statement & supporting change in the laws?
5678 2018-02-22 04:27:12 damn, meant to put Semi, I know automatic are "banned", yet loophole existed with bump stocks type devices.
5679 2018-02-22 04:26:17 We need ONE comprehensive bill from the US Congress with these 4 items:

Universal Background checks (including state mandates on uniform data entry)

Raising minimum age to buy ANY gun to 21

MAGAZINE SIZE (def no more than 9)

Ban Bump stocks

& DON’T. ARM. TEACHERS! Bad. Idea!
5680 2018-02-22 04:26:11 When you have Longs and Shorts on separate stocks...Emotions are confusingly mixed as where you want the markets to go
5681 2018-02-22 04:26:05 Ya know, before Texas, bump stocks were something only gun hobbyists even knew about. Now, everybody knows about them.  TMK, bump stocks weren't used in a crime before Texas. So, sure, ban them. It's just more meaningless "feel good" legislation which won't change a thing.
5682 2018-02-22 04:25:45 Hope u have enough stocks for all those people lol
5683 2018-02-22 04:25:44 Automatic weapons already are banned for civilians. I think you also mean magazines. I'm not sure it matters though. People can theoretically have an unlimited amount of 10 round mags already pre-loaded. No issue from me with bump stocks being phased out.
5684 2018-02-22 04:24:51 This argument is why semi automatics, high capacity magazines,  and bump stocks should be illegal. 

All made for killing large numbers of people. Not for protection.
5685 2018-02-22 04:24:46 Gun manufacturers still have hundreds of millions to buy all the congress critters they need. 
Best case, bump stocks are banned. Which is an add on part the NRA is willing to sacrifice as long as they can still sell weapons of war to anybody with $400.
5686 2018-02-22 04:24:43 Lawmakers think that arming teachers and banning bump stocks are a start to a solution to mass murder. They’re non-starters, counter intuitive, un-enlightened. So are the solutions they propose
5687 2018-02-22 04:24:29 Antaas na ng lipad ng Villar stocks. Naging ginto n ang haven.
5688 2018-02-22 04:24:26 Asian Stocks Lower After Fed Report Renews Bond Yield Fears - U.S. News & World Report
5689 2018-02-22 04:23:58 I hope bump stocks bill will fail
5690 2018-02-22 04:23:53 The NRA will say he flip flopped on age restrictions and bump stocks.
5691 2018-02-22 04:23:44 What the hell, have we America sank so low that we become a police state? What's wrong with more intense background checks? Ban sale of Assault Weapons and bump stocks, longer wait period to obtain your gun. Better mental health screening and no gun sales to anyone under 21!
5692 2018-02-22 04:23:40 @realDonaldTrump Mr President bump stocks are not the problem don't give in to the anti gun left. Mental health issues to blame in Florida shooting. #NotWhyWeElectedYou #Pro2A
5693 2018-02-22 04:23:27 @DLoesch You patronized those kids by suggesting you stand for them, but you really don't when you can't suggest that automatic weapons and bump stocks be banned. #thesehavezerotodowithhunting
5694 2018-02-22 04:22:56 You are supposed to keep these insights to yourself! I think stocks will surge until there is a bill being voted on and then they will drop!
5695 2018-02-22 04:22:54 Of course she did. Bc NRA are used to this shit. Point fingers the other way.
Sutherland Sorings? Oh, Air Force data entry folks are to blame
Stephen Paddock? Oh, um, lets tell our guys to say ban bump stocks and drop it after 2 weeks
Shall I go on?
5696 2018-02-22 04:22:53 I would have said that I can take donations from who I want. The NRA didn't kill those kids, they didn't promote the shooter. They even considered banning bump stocks when the Florida shooting happened with Steven Paddock
5697 2018-02-22 04:22:41 If it were illegal for civilians to purchase/sell/posses *military grade* weapons & ammo there would be no need to ban bump stocks, raise the legal age to purchase firearms etc. It’s the type of weapon, stupid. #NeverAgain #ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunLawsNOW #FuckTheNRA
5698 2018-02-22 04:22:31 But don’t you support a ban on fully auto weapons, extended clips and bump stocks? I’m a Conservative and agree that this is a reasonable compromise.
5699 2018-02-22 04:22:29 @MSNBC BREAKING.   Attorney General, "Jeff," to propose maybe banning "bump stocks"  sometime in the future.
5700 2018-02-22 04:22:23 How do u decide buying price for stocks like these as it’s hitting 5% lower circuit daily?
5701 2018-02-22 04:22:17 It’s an easy concession to the irrational Left.  Ban bump stocks as well. They’re just gimmicks.

Demand nation wide concealed carry reciprocity in return.

Never relent on defense of all the Bill of Rights.
5702 2018-02-22 04:22:03 The grown up thing to do right now is to become close to whoever is selling Moncler stocks
5703 2018-02-22 04:21:59 Lol, yes I started a new website not about me but just about stocks/crypto.  I matched my account to that.  I've been back in for awhile now.
5704 2018-02-22 04:21:45 Im using broad terms to make the same point you retard. Bump stocks are very easy to make your own. 2 pistols have the same magazine size and more power in close range than an AR.
Again, take these away from law abiding citizens and now only criminals have them.
5705 2018-02-22 04:21:37 Republicans use " blue lives matter"  when it is convenient for their arguement. The police want less of these weapons on the streets too - it's their lives on the front line with these weapons, and accessories like bump stocks.
5706 2018-02-22 04:21:28 Maybe because she had just finished lying by claiming the NRA  supports banning bump stocks?
5707 2018-02-22 04:21:18 Just heard the news say that bump stocks turn automatic rifles into machine guns. 

God help us all.
5708 2018-02-22 04:21:10 Bump stocks should’ve been banned on October 2, 2017, @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio. Even the @nra supported that. It’s now 3.5 months later, and you’re only talking about it b/c a bunch of teens are forcing you to.
5709 2018-02-22 04:21:03 It’s not any easier now to get Americans to disarm. Tougher gun laws are a first step. Ban bump stocks! Gotta start somewhere.
5710 2018-02-22 04:21:02 L&T Finance and RBL Bank are growth stocks from NBFC/Banking sectors in a long term Portfolio!
5711 2018-02-22 04:20:48 I’m not disagreeing about bump stocks sure outlaw them but it can still be modified. I’m all in for being apart of the solution but my original point @BrianKarem was being a part of the problem with no solutions. I’m not sure what your point is with the picture..
5712 2018-02-22 04:20:14 Boldfaced lie about the NRA is for banning bump stocks! #NRAKillsKids
5713 2018-02-22 04:19:41 Bump stocks are senseless add on.I have 20-30 friends that have AR-15's & not 1 of them cared enough 2 modify the gun 4 rapidity purposes . Some,for sight purposes & trigger weight. Plus,most clips are 30 rounds.That's reloading 20 times in 1 minute. Your facts are Specious .
5714 2018-02-22 04:19:32 Yes, BUT those military style weapons & bump stocks & high capacity clips should NOT be sold to non-military citizens, AND all this weapons & bump stocks & clips already owned by citizens should be confiscated. That would NOT undermine the 2nd Amendment.
5715 2018-02-22 04:19:06 I'm a solid NO on 'fun control.' I'm all for fun.

Ban all weapons, no. Assault weapons, yes. Bump stocks, yes. High capacity magazines, yes. Just my view. Open to all potential solutions, including better background checks, more mental health resources, etc.
5716 2018-02-22 04:19:04 E stocks konnavu btw
5717 2018-02-22 04:18:56 Joe must own gun stocks. I saw him heading into a CVS in Schaumburg buying enough astroglide to lube a hippo through a doggie door.
5718 2018-02-22 04:18:52 My girl said "babe what you gonna do while im gone for the weekend?" Im like bihh what? Im bout to be study these stocks and learning how to get this money! Faaaaaawwwkkkk you mean O_o
5719 2018-02-22 04:18:51 Mentally deranged people shouldn’t own firearms
People on the no fly list shouldn’t own firearms
Felons shouldn’t own firearms
Bump stocks shouldn’t be allowed
Fully automatic rifles shouldn’t be allowed
Magazines that hold more than 15 rounds shouldn’t be allowed
18 year olds...
5720 2018-02-22 04:18:40 Good point. Bump stocks too.
5721 2018-02-22 04:18:39 These RESPONDERS ARE NOT CHILDREN. THEY'RE YOUNG ADULTS!!! THERE ARE THOUSANDS, SOON OF VOTING AGE, THEY UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN SOME OTHERS! NO CIVILIAN NEEDS ASSAULT WEAPONS AK15 OR BUMP STOCKS
Assault Weapons Not Protected by Second Amendment, Federal Appeals Court Rules!!!
5722 2018-02-22 04:18:30 The @maddow 2/21/18 show pointed out banning bump stocks would take an act of Congress. So this talk of exec action is just for show.
5723 2018-02-22 04:18:06 Still haven't heard from any of the hundreds of trump hating Chicago media actually commend him for doing what Obama failed to do in 2010 when given the chance. Ban bump stocks. Hold a town hall w victims. Ask congress to vote on a bipartisan bill already ready to go. Baby Steps.
5724 2018-02-22 04:17:42 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets
4. Ban personal ownership of assault weapons but allow use in gun ranges
5. Require registration of ALL guns
6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system
#NeverAgain
5725 2018-02-22 04:17:27 Did you watch the whole thing? She the NRA supports the ban on bump-stocks.
5726 2018-02-22 04:17:10 I’m not one who supports banning particular types of guns or taking guns away from law abiding citizens. The discussion was about doing more to keep guns away from violent criminals and mentally ill, and limiting accessibility of large magazines and bump stocks. Please keep up.
5727 2018-02-22 04:16:40 #budgetspeech2018 I have always suspected that the markets are not on the same side with the people. While most of us are complaining the markets are happy. Stocks up and Rand stronger
5728 2018-02-22 04:16:28 Issue an Executive Order to stop bump stocks, stop AR15. You can ban Muslims, ban these weapons of war.
5729 2018-02-22 04:15:52 Here's a thought ban AR rifles and bump stocks for starters. Everyone thinks that's a good start
5730 2018-02-22 04:15:33 Good thing no one is asking them to lay down their lives, only to lay down their assult rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
5731 2018-02-22 04:15:08 The population of the United States is 325,145,963. So your membership does not come close to the majority of The American People who want semi automatic weapons of war and bump stocks banned.
5732 2018-02-22 04:14:57 Ban 
- Automatic weapons
- Bump Stocks
- Clips larger than 10 bullets
Implement measures for
- Universal Background Checks
- Mental Healthcare
- School Security
- Law Enforcement
5733 2018-02-22 04:14:50 If the @NRA and @DLoesch claim to care about background checks, reporting and supposedly now are against bump stocks then why can’t they publicly denounce and stop funding politicians who can’t/don’t show they have policies or voting records in line with these?
5734 2018-02-22 04:14:49 You can ban, bump stocks all you want. Considering how low tech a bump stock is, I could build one out of a scrap stuff around my garage in about an hour. So ban what you want and the only people who will follow the ban is the people you didn’t need to worry about anyhow.
5735 2018-02-22 04:14:45 As usual you look like a moron.  You needed talking points and answers to talk to a group of grieving citizens.  NO guns on teaches, how stupid can you be.  NO WALL.  BAN Assualt guns and their bullets, and bump stocks.  More money for mental health and guidance.
5736 2018-02-22 04:14:07 It's okay and for lightsticks there's normally enough stocks last year u went to queue at 12 and still managed to get it but everything else was out of stock though 
5737 2018-02-22 04:14:03 Well we are finally on the diving board with Trump agreeing to go with the mass hysteria over the mass shootings ! the 2nd amendment says no infringement PERIOD ! I am against bump stocks but it is impossible to ban them they were banned by Clinton ut ti didn't last
5738 2018-02-22 04:14:01 Two things will happen tomorrow. The stocks of gun manufacturers will go up and there will be a run on AR-15s and high-capacity magazines. It happens every single time. And I say this as someone who wouldn't blink an eye if either was prohibited.
5739 2018-02-22 04:13:59 Add me too. Bullish from around October last year. But i believe that the party is only just beginning. Still there are plenty bargains in tech stocks.
5740 2018-02-22 04:13:53 what HASN'T he thought about for less than a nano sec b4 belching out as a tweet.....here's my take.... right after he said to outlaw bump stocks - he took a call from the #NRA reminding him of the  $30 mil.  oops.
5741 2018-02-22 04:13:41 FixNix is the very MINIMUM the lawmakers can do for #GunReformNow HOWEVER It Does NOT Require BackGround checks for Gun Shows or Private Sales, It Does NOT Req ALL Guns Lost/Stolen be Reported to Police, It's a FEEL GOOD along w/Bump Stocks by DOJ- NEED LAWS. #NoNRABloodMoney
5742 2018-02-22 04:13:34 Banning bump stocks is not going to be correctly effective. Nor is basically any type of gun reformity besides psyc evaluations.
5743 2018-02-22 04:13:31 @marcorubio if a "weapon ban" Won't work because manufacturers will find loopholes, how about start clear. An absolute ban on the manufacture, sale or possession of bump stocks, magazine's in excess of 9 rounds (to be phased in over 3 or 5 years)
5744 2018-02-22 04:13:31 I disagree. Tonight wasn't divisive - it was Americans sharing a stage and talking about a difficult topic. We need more of that. My takeway from tonight's #CNNTownHall - there is no place for assault weapons and bump stocks in USA. None. #StonemanDouglas #NeverAgain
5745 2018-02-22 04:13:27 Just guns, bump stocks, large magazine clips, large quantities of bullets, and child porn.
5746 2018-02-22 04:13:25 Wow did Obama hold an conference with highschool kids, or sign a bill to ban bump stocks after Sandy Hook. I’m impressed with the quick action of this administration.
5747 2018-02-22 04:13:08 If you add a dime to taking bumper stocks off automatic weapons, it’d be worth a ten cent candy bar.
5748 2018-02-22 04:13:08 So the @NRA stance on banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines is “just let the ATF decide”? #StudentsStandUp
5749 2018-02-22 04:12:53 Hoping you look into change. Bump stocks, high capacity magazines is a step in right direction. Glad you showed up.
5750 2018-02-22 04:12:27 President trump has ordered an attorney to ban bump stocks which let him shoot semi automaticity. This was used by the shooter in LasVegas. The student protest to ban guns has grown and will continue growing. Both articles are reales because they both talk about guns.#ghhsci22118
5751 2018-02-22 04:12:25 Happy Holi...

5752 2018-02-22 04:12:05 The NRA has convinced them that any rule is an attack on the 2nd amendment. Restrict  people in the no fly list, restrict people mentally incapable of their own care, restrict domestic abusers, raise the age to purchase, ban bump stocks. NRA tells them vote no.
5753 2018-02-22 04:12:04 Trump is just placating the NRA. He doesn’t give a crap about the lives lost. This is an opportunity to ban semi automatics, assault weapons, magazines, bump stocks and silencers.  This is the chance to raise the age to 25, have data bases that are comprehensive. Gun Control Now!
5754 2018-02-22 04:11:59 @marcorubio made a lot of big claims tonight concerning bump stocks, age limitations on rifle purchases, and overall reconsidering his stances. HOLD. HIM. ACCOUNTABLE.
5755 2018-02-22 04:11:53 Assault weapons are already banned,there Illegal you can't buy them but things like bump stocks those should not be sold,AR 15 is not a assault rifle.
5756 2018-02-22 04:11:23 So this "evil" person you're talking about as "the problem" will either 
A. attack others using a blade (knife, axe..etc), rocks, or even a handgun.  
or
B.  attack others using an automatic weapon with bump stocks for faster mag reloading 1/2
5757 2018-02-22 04:10:53 Bump stocks have been used in exactly one mass shooting in the last 60 years. #FactsMatter
5758 2018-02-22 04:10:50 Is that why he’s supportive of raising the long gun age requirement to 21? Is that why he’s supportive of magazine restrictions? Is that why he’s supportive of banning devices that “could” alter fire rate (stocks, triggers, etc)?
5759 2018-02-22 04:10:49 A rifle is powerful, but not necessarily faster, like I pointed out before it does not “spray bullets” as people have claimed before. Enhancements do that like bump-stocks.
5760 2018-02-22 04:10:35 Banning bump stocks and raising age limits are sacrificial pawns the NRA floats so that we don't focus on real gun control measures.
5761 2018-02-22 04:10:34 Didn't he just say he wants teachers to carry concealed guns a day after he pledged to look into banning bump stocks?  I would not have felt safe in school if my teacher had a gun in the classroom!
5762 2018-02-22 04:10:34 U r as dense and PHONEY as djt bump stocks aren't even a start.
5763 2018-02-22 04:10:31 The Vegas shooter used bump stocks. Class dismissed.
5764 2018-02-22 04:10:26 @realDonaldTrump I do not agree with arming teachers. My wife is a teacher and every teacher at her school is against this. I feel this is best handled by states at the state level. I also feel that high round magazines for these rifles should be illegal along with bump stocks.
5765 2018-02-22 04:10:25 Loesch was outright lying about NRA policy about bump stocks and allowing mentally ill to have guns. Rubio is in NRA's pocket. He made a couple of concessions but if history is any indication he'll backtrack

I will be in D.C. soon and hope to meet with you.

5770 2018-02-22 04:08:26 Owning a gun doesn’t make one a bad person.  The focus is on common sense legislation regarding assault rifles, bump stocks, improving background checks, age restrictions and access to mental health care.
5771 2018-02-22 04:08:26 Who is obtaining fully automatic weapons?  Or do they mean weapons with bump stocks?
5772 2018-02-22 04:08:23 @marcorubio we look forward to you following up on raising the minimum age to own those types of weapons (if not the outright ban) and also making sure bump stocks get banned. 

@FLGovScott Didn’t see you there? Weird...

#CNNTownhall
5773 2018-02-22 04:07:58 The laws should be
1) no sale of military style weapons and bump stocks to non-military citizen, AND
2) all those already owned my non-military citizens should be confiscated or "bought back".
5774 2018-02-22 04:07:54 I personally don't want or need one, but they're used a lot for hunting and sports. Almost all modern handguns are semi-auto too. Fully automatic weapons have been restricted for over 80 years. Imo the bump stocks being legal and poor background checks are the biggest issues.
5775 2018-02-22 04:07:51 Quit debating ARs or AKs. Stop pissing around the main issue. The issue is semiauto, higher capacity weapons.  You can’t legally hunt migratory birds with more than 3 shells; big game is generally limited to 5. Hand guns, max 9. That’s it. Oh, and no bump stocks or the like.
5776 2018-02-22 04:07:51 At the town hall inFlorida tonite, Rubio is willing to talk about background check improvement, ban bump stocks, and maybe... smaller magazines, TBD. 

What should have been done in 2011 when Gabby Gifford was next to slaughtered in a strip mall in AZ .
 
He is full of NRA POOP
5777 2018-02-22 04:07:43 What stocks is for companies, Crypto is for  future digital technologies.
20 years back who were called villains for stock investing are today's smart investors.
20 years future what will we call Crypto investors today's illegal workers ? #crypto #bitcoin
5778 2018-02-22 04:07:22 #ThankYouPresidentTrump for talking with victims of gun violence today. I hope you act on banning bump stocks, age restrictions and stiffer background checks. #NeverAgain #GunContolNow #guns #GunLawsNOW #ParklandShooting
5779 2018-02-22 04:07:14 Ban AR-15's & bump-stocks, I have nvr owned a gun & never will.   It won't stop innocent pple from getting killed (Chicago (oh my bad that's Indiana's fault)).  Also, the limit the entire liberal media's 1st amd right for colluding with Russia to create discord about US elections

5781 2018-02-22 04:07:02 No disagreement on that aspect of transfer of information. I feel that when you have military grade weaponry available for purchase you get these outcomes and the sales of them along with bump stocks must cease.
5782 2018-02-22 04:06:51 The answer from the NRA funded. Give up bump stocks and declare victory. Next mass shooting give up high capacity magazines. Then give up nuts owning guns. Then domestic abusers. Etc. By that time it should be 2050.
5783 2018-02-22 04:06:50 And good point about bump stocks...you knocked one of the list of many haha
5784 2018-02-22 04:06:49 will give @realDonaldTrump credit where it's due: #thankyou for looking into strengthening background checks and banning bump fire stocks 
5785 2018-02-22 04:06:38 Tomorrow I’m selling any stocks I have left and I am pulling my 401K .
The dollar is collapsing.
#bitcoin is the solution!
5786 2018-02-22 04:06:36 So why were you only responses avoiding the real issue of banning assault weapons, bump stocks, and any other rapid fire weapons? That $30M from the NRA holding your balls a little too tight? Maybe metal detectors in schools instead of a wall? Mexicans aren’t a problem. You are!
5787 2018-02-22 04:06:30 Trump wants a solution, but the most obvious idea (the assault weapons ban) is already off the table and the second best idea (mandatory background check) is pretty close to being off the table.  So we get talk about baby steps like banning bump stocks, doing more sharing
5788 2018-02-22 04:06:24 Quit debating ARs or AKs. Stop pissing around the main issue. The issue is semiauto, higher capacity weapons.  You can’t legally hunt migratory birds with more than 3 shells; big game is generally limited to 5. Hand guns, max 9. That’s it. Oh, and no bump stocks or the like.
5789 2018-02-22 04:06:23 This can be your legacy, make our children safe in schools. Be aggressive with gun control. I am not saying take away all guns, but automatic and semi automatics, bump stocks-have no place in civilians hands. Put metal detectors in schools and armed resource officers.
5790 2018-02-22 04:06:13 Isn't it odd, trump can sign executive orders for stopping just about everything else, why not sign many to control guns, mentally ill obtaining guns, ban assault weapons, gun stocks, et al.
5791 2018-02-22 04:06:00 Follow stocks that rock your socks off. $TWTR, yeah $TWTR, there is bullish flag on weekly/monthly candles as long as we hold $30+.
5792 2018-02-22 04:05:52 The answer still hasn't been given by Ms Loesch why are semi automatic weapons needed by anyone other than military or police???Bump stocks AR15's etc are not for self defense

5794 2018-02-22 04:05:14 @RepBrianFitz @SenToomey @SenBobCasey hi, I’m a constituent. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks. You’re capable of leading the charge to do this. Thank you
5795 2018-02-22 04:05:11 @SpeakerRyan Paul, listen to the children of Stoneman Douglas, call for a special session and vote to ban assault rifles bunt stocks or any device that can change a regular rifle into an automatic weapon. Do something now or we’ll remember you didnt when you run again.
5796 2018-02-22 04:05:04 . @DLoesch does @NRA support/oppose:
- no fly/no buy
- background checks on ALL gun sales/gift recipients including gun shows & private sales, and no sale until  complete
- prohibiting all people with a restraining order from buying/possessing any firearms
- ban bump stocks?
5797 2018-02-22 04:04:16 Also, as an 'Independent'...I believe in some common sense solutions. Like raising the minimum age to purchase guns to 21. Get rid of 'bump stocks'. Stronger background checks. Finally, get rid of the 'swap meet' firearm sales...
5798 2018-02-22 04:04:14 I want to take all your guns. But I’ll settle for background checks,banning bump stocks, and stopping sale of guns like AR-15. Because compromise is how laws get made. Meet us in the middle.
5799 2018-02-22 04:04:11 Mr. President please do not disallow the use of bump stocks,  I have disabilities that hinder me greatly using a rifle. The left is hoping you will to hurt yourself in the next election, stand strong & be the man so many like. You are going down in history as our greatest..
5800 2018-02-22 04:04:05 Our educators live paycheck to paycheck. So, were supposed to expect them to lay their lives down for our kids? Why? Why should anyone die? How about we ban high caliber rifles and guns. No bump stocks. Etc.
5801 2018-02-22 04:03:53 Last full year media  pumping financial stocks now pushing IT sector,why they not highlighted IT sector in last year? Think before jump 
5802 2018-02-22 04:03:51 The banking system in this nation is obsolete, when you transact in ether it done in seconds, why in the world do you have to wait 3 to 5 business days to clear your paycheck? When algorithms buy and sell stocks in seconds?
5803 2018-02-22 04:03:45 Tech stocks up. Banking stocks down. We are likely to see a lot more of this in coming times whenever there is a macro event every few weeks.
5804 2018-02-22 04:02:27 Shall @realDonaldTrump outlaw Bump stocks...I feel there are other energy absorbing methods to transfer that back in to the firearm.
5805 2018-02-22 04:02:23 i've always wanted to invest in stocks but i have no idea how 
5806 2018-02-22 04:02:08 My indicator summary $SPY: net indicators leaning bull. VIX still in spike mode with $VXX RSI at 61. $SPY RSI neutral at 47. 5 of 10 of my best $SPY systems are long. Recent rally still stalled at mid point between 1/26 high and 2/9 low. STocks frequently fall after Fed Weds.
5807 2018-02-22 04:02:07 If the stock market is going to live on, we should make it as easy as possible for regular people to actually legally own their holdings.

It's "be your own bank" for stocks.
5808 2018-02-22 04:01:56 I’m betting that out of this sickening tragedy, there will be some changes.
Trump is in the process of banning bump stocks. Why Obama legalized them in 2010, despite the NRA telling him not to, is very perplexing.
I’m all for an age restriction and tighter checks.
5809 2018-02-22 04:01:33 hello! I only accept reservation for the fans because I have more stocks. For banners, it's first come first serve :-)
5810 2018-02-22 04:01:32 I will be on Statewide Drive radio @ABCNSW today at 4.45pm to discuss markets and stocks.
5811 2018-02-22 04:01:32 This is why if gun owners really care about strong background checks and banning of bump stocks and just basic common sense gun regulation they need to withdraw from the NRA.
5812 2018-02-22 04:01:24 I agree, a Trump voter, to increase background checks on all weapons; age limit 21 and over; limit on military style ammo to include a waiting period; outlaw bump stocks; recognize to institutionalize and treat! Don’t put me in your bag of garbage!
5813 2018-02-22 04:01:13 Actually, plenty of things should be off the table. Bump stocks, high caliber magazines, and math teachers with guns should all be off the table. Don’t give me different times. This happens nowhere else in the world.
5814 2018-02-22 04:01:09 no stocks used
5815 2018-02-22 04:00:36 Liar! The DOJ can do nothing about bump stocks. Only Congress can do that. And Loesch knows it! #NeverAgain #CNNTownHall
5816 2018-02-22 04:00:28 Maybe instead of bribing politicians the @NRA  should fund whatever it takes to make our children safe. They could help ban military weapons/bump stocks etc.,close gun show loopholes. But nah....they are just our children.
5817 2018-02-22 03:59:59 I’m not a supporter of you but I appreciate your effort today & hope that you were genuine to drive change (background checks for illness and criminals, increase age on all gun buys & ban stocks and military like assault weapons)
5818 2018-02-22 03:59:56 They don't want the stocks to fall on the #StockMarket for AR-15s and for money not to filter back into the #NRA. This is about greed and who is benefiting from sales of guns. Prayers of strength from Australia to parents, family, friends standing up and being counted. #Oneness
5819 2018-02-22 03:59:53 Back ground checks, clip limit, no bump stocks I’m cool with it. As long as I can go hunt and shoot some skeet then I have no complaints.
5820 2018-02-22 03:59:43 "Okay, we'll consider a bill to ban bump stocks, but only if the bill also includes mandatory free guns with every Chik-fil-a meal purchase"
5821 2018-02-22 03:59:41 Did Cruz use a bump stock?  Because all I hear is pablum about banning bump stocks, as if that would stop mental defects from finding a way to kill innocent people.
5822 2018-02-22 03:59:35 Watch what 45 does never listen 2 what he says.He’s already done the damage & he has no intention to support gun reform, the bump stocks was a PR stunt he did it with Vegas & DOJ already told him they can’t amend that only legislation will.
5823 2018-02-22 03:59:30 Why do these nice guys with guns need assault rifles? Bump stocks? Explain that! Hunting? A huge flock of burglars? Fun? We have limits on free speech. There can be reasonable limits on guns.

5825 2018-02-22 03:58:55 Be nice her job is seem amiable to tiny improved gun regs when we all know not gonna happen legislatively.  The look reasonable to national audience who won't see stories in three days about how NRA against what she said.  They did this w bump stocks after Vegas
5826 2018-02-22 03:58:41 Gladly not seeing the NRA’s ridiculous arguments to kids. To hell with the NRA leadership. Good guys with guns is a myth. Rape victims don’t need assault rifles. Incremental precautions are a good idea, not a slippery slope. They defended cop killer bullets and bump stocks.
5827 2018-02-22 03:58:27 @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are not God, and do not have the authority to negotiate or in any way control our gun rights, and this includes banning bump stocks!  No more compromise with this globalist controlled government.
5828 2018-02-22 03:58:21 At least Pres Trump, whether you like or hate him, had all those folks at WH tonight to discuss ideas and he wants to pass legislation to ban bump stocks.  Its a start
5829 2018-02-22 03:58:15 5 yrs ago the DOJ said they can't do anything about bump stocks; you can ask @SenFeinstein She has a bill ready. The prez is wasting time asking again. YOU can change the age to AT LEAST 21 or higher. YOU can make ALL 50 do the things Florida left up to counties and don't do! 1/2
5830 2018-02-22 03:57:53 Seems to me bump stocks are selling pretty fast, doesnt that turn a semi auto rifle into fully auto? Or at least speed uo the rounds per minute?
5831 2018-02-22 03:57:47 @jaketapper @PoppyHarlowCNN @JohnKingCNN @CarolHLN @ananavarro #NeverAgain  Do not need a ban on bump stocks.  Conversion of a semi auto AR !5 or AR10 to fully auto is already illegal . That was 2 prevent filing trigger down to keep  it firing. It also applies to new Bump Stocks
5832 2018-02-22 03:57:43 Bump stocks do not make a semi auto into an auto.
5833 2018-02-22 03:57:41 Multiple instruments with which to kill. Semi autos least of them. Offer suggestions that can make a difference immediately. Security agents, armed trained select teachers, age restrictions, early warning notification system, no bump stocks. Broaden your scope. Not guns alone.
5834 2018-02-22 03:57:31 -Increase Standards for background checks
-People with mental illnesses & on the no fly zone should not be able to own guns
-Gun age should be upgraded to age 21 & ban bump stocks
-We should train, JUST security guards who are well trained and have licenses too have guns & Carry
5835 2018-02-22 03:57:05 I feel like the powers that be will blowup stocks over bonds every time. Gov’s still need to fund deficits
5836 2018-02-22 03:57:02 Nearly 10 years of Fed's zero-interest rate policies were great for stocks, but now higher interest rates are even better?  That Bloomberg article was comical.
5837 2018-02-22 03:56:34 @DLoesch Without using the words Madman, crazy person or red flags, please answer the following, simple question. Do you think bump stocks and assault rifles should be banned?
5838 2018-02-22 03:56:28 Robinhood is fine if you're just playing stocks. I saved nearly $4,000 in commissions last year with them. I also use TD, Ally and Scottrade for options. RH is rolling out options now too...
5839 2018-02-22 03:56:24 Good list @arkansastravler. I would also add high capacity magazines + bump stocks. These are the minimum things that need to become law. I am tired of the politicians that the NRA has bought saying we need to think about this. BS! Act now!
5840 2018-02-22 03:56:00 The multiple shooters, from multiple floors at the Las Vegas shooting, did they use bump stocks???
5841 2018-02-22 03:55:59 Bump stocks are not illegal right?
5842 2018-02-22 03:55:50 Three steps need to be taken now.
1.  AR-15 needs to be banned from public use.
2.  Bump stocks need to be banned.
3.  Stringent background checks need to be put in place.
5843 2018-02-22 03:55:45 Yes ban bump stocks and limit magazine clips, thorough background checks and enforce all states follow and update info within 24 hrs has to be a national database set up and monitored for all purchases of firearms
5844 2018-02-22 03:55:26 the message was regarding stocks. what about mutual funds, can we put something in small cap, mid cap and multicap funds
5845 2018-02-22 03:55:24 mY stocks are crashinng times are tough in neopetS.
5846 2018-02-22 03:55:21 You have mentioned, on many an occasion, that due to your financial situation and age that you are fairly risky with your investments. Do you move money into stocks of gun manufacturers when Americans’ fear rises like this? If so, which companies do you recommend?
5847 2018-02-22 03:55:20 Dana Loesch knows if the NRA wanted Congress to strengthen background checks and ban bump stocks. They would have done it years ago. #CNNTownHall
5848 2018-02-22 03:55:14 And he shot over 500 people with assault type weapons & bump stocks change the laws !!
5849 2018-02-22 03:54:53 That sounds pretty sensible to me. Intense background checks on pistols and handguns for self defense (and hunting if that’s your thing I guess ), and no semiautomatic or automatic weapons. No bump stocks, etc.
5850 2018-02-22 03:54:48 *Parkland shooter does not use bump stock*
Trump: BAN BUMP STOCKS
5851 2018-02-22 03:54:31 How bout Americans keep our guns and bump stocks and ban staged attacks, crisis actors and libtards.
5852 2018-02-22 03:54:29 For profit prison stocks continue to rise
5853 2018-02-22 03:54:16 Lets make this easy...No more assault weapons, high capacity magazines or bump stocks.  If none to be had it wont be an issue.
5854 2018-02-22 03:54:07 #Crypto HODL'rs do you own #Stocks too?
5855 2018-02-22 03:53:51 Absolutely, I told a friend theyre not paying WayneLapierre a base salary of a million dollars to protect your 2nd amendment rights, no they are a lobby for the Gun industry, period" and when tragedies happen sales and stocks go up. SHE is a true believer I think, but its about $
5856 2018-02-22 03:53:46 Dana wants to keep talking about background checks, which I fully support, but doesn't even want to talk about banning bump stocks or assault weapons. I think we need to consider all the options when lives are on the line #SFASUPSC
5857 2018-02-22 03:53:41 Wrong. Semi auto fires one round at a time. You have to pull the trigger each time. Laws are already in place. BO approved bump stocks. Just follow the law, recind bump stocks. Another BO directive bites the dust. Hows that FBI collusion thing going? I hear u were involved? True?
5858 2018-02-22 03:53:26 The NRA opposes banning bump stocks. 

The NRA opposes expanding background checks. 

The NRA opposes creating a federal database of gun sales. 

... no matter what Dana Loesch tried to claim tonight.
5859 2018-02-22 03:53:17 The current loophole in current gun laws is the use of 'bump stocks' . Machine guns are banned, so close the loophole! Does the @nra support that?@marcorubio do you? #StudentsStandUp
5860 2018-02-22 03:53:04 I'm aware of who I voted for. And, the NRA also endorsed Reagan, Santorum, and Bush. You can't say it's just him. In case you didn't watch the news today, he sat with survivors and parents of the deceased, and is proposing a ban of bump stocks. So, is he still doing nothing?
5861 2018-02-22 03:52:43 It’s unbelievable the @NRA won’t admit bump stocks should be illegal #ParklandStudentsSpeak
5862 2018-02-22 03:52:35 Stricter gun laws, background checks, a national record of gun violence, purchases and red flags to communicate between states effectively. Make bump stocks illegal. Better fund our police force. Set limits on clip size. The answers to your question was just a google search away
5863 2018-02-22 03:52:26 Selling more guns is all. And I will hazard a guess that bump stocks flew off the shelves in preparation for the ban (which is never coming)
5864 2018-02-22 03:52:21 And how about #Obama legalizing bump stocks?
5865 2018-02-22 03:52:13 my opinions on gun-law:
-get rid of gun-free zones
-equip teachers &/OR have assigned security in every school
-illegalize bump stocks
-INTENSELY vet those acquiring semi-auto rifles (no ban)
-consistently establish all laws on national level
-lower mag capacities
5866 2018-02-22 03:52:00 Watching @CNN #StudentsStandUp Town Hall. Why aren’t gun control advocates talking about repealing the Dickey Amendment - which currently prohibits the @CDCgov from conducting research on gun violence - in the same breath as banning bump stocks or assault weapons? #NeverAgain
5867 2018-02-22 03:51:38 N trump doesn't get a prize for saying he's going to ban assault weapons/bumper stocks. WHEN never. Instead he wants more guns in schools. What an idiot, so why r they not allowed at primaries or his speech's.
5868 2018-02-22 03:51:37 Terrorists and bots keep repeating 'mental health' and 'arm teachers' and 'bump stocks' to shift the frame in their direction, far, far from where the discussion needs to be. #StudentsStandUp
5869 2018-02-22 03:51:23 Still on bump stocks.. well the gun community says you can have them they don't like them anyway. It's a waste of money especially when you can do it without them..  #nobodycaresaboutbumpstocks.
5870 2018-02-22 03:51:08 Bump stocks. Arming teachers. All BS. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.
5871 2018-02-22 03:50:44 #NeverAgain Wait-The NRA  asked Congress to address bump stocks by regulatory fix NOT legislation.   Don’t let her off the hook!
5872 2018-02-22 03:50:33 pretty simple. Semis gone with magazines and bump stocks
5873 2018-02-22 03:50:33 Almost 4 months since the Vegas shooting, everyone agreed then bump stocks are bad...yeh.  #StudentsStandUp
5874 2018-02-22 03:50:31 Tighter restrictions on gun purchases, eliminate gun show purchases, full background checks and mental health evaluations and a minimum of 6 months waiting period to further evaluate a person's stability. Also eliminate bump stocks. They are unnecessary and too much for citizens.

5876 2018-02-22 03:50:17 Happy that Trump took the time to listen to those affected by the Parkland shooting. Now it's time for action. Banning bump stocks is one step of many that need to be taken.
5877 2018-02-22 03:49:57 Bump stocks ain’t shit.
5878 2018-02-22 03:49:37 Yeah I am a little disappointed the convo is fixating so much on age and bump stocks and all that. kind of feels like missing the forest for the trees
5879 2018-02-22 03:49:29 Bump stocks ban. Because it'd be SO much harder to kill innocent high school students with your run-of-the-mill AR-15! @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump #NeverAgainMSD
5880 2018-02-22 03:49:24 I don’t know but why but guns with wood stocks are so much more pretty
5881 2018-02-22 03:49:12 background checks as a start is not "major" legislation. bump stocks are not some huge complex piece of legislation. senators and representatives just got through saying how much of a SIMPLE piece of legislation this is
5882 2018-02-22 03:49:12 But they have bump stocks to circumvent that
5883 2018-02-22 03:49:11 if it's smash 4 u can play dogfight; set up 8 level 9 npc duck hunt dogs with three stocks and bet on how they will place (lol this isn't rly playing but still)
5884 2018-02-22 03:48:48 Bump stocks are a decoy, a sacrificial lamb.
Ban the things bump stocks attach to and you won’t have to worry about them.
5885 2018-02-22 03:48:39 Getting rid of semiautomatic rifles & bump stocks will likely reduce carnage, teaching people how to positively deal with lonliness, addiction, & rejection can better end it.
5886 2018-02-22 03:48:37 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   You are the president, remember? You could ban bump stocks today with an EO.  That is if you really wanted to do something, and not just pay lip service to the kids. Use your power for good for the people.
5887 2018-02-22 03:48:32 @DLoesch Its not about getting a firearm. It’s about automatic weapons, large capacity magazines and bump stocks that can cause mass murder in minutes. You are part of the reason those kids died #NRABloodOnYourHands
5888 2018-02-22 03:48:27 #WeCallBS #EmmaGonzalez save us. Ask the question again. Ask the #NRABloodMoney drone whats your position on banning semiautomatic weapons. Dont mention bump stocks.
5889 2018-02-22 03:48:19 @BuzzFeedNews the @NRA has just advocated on live TV for increased protections for media companies like you from threats. also supports universal background checks and restricting bump stocks, for the first time. any comment?
5890 2018-02-22 03:47:52 I have traded stocks
On a bourse with no name 
It felt good to get back in the game
5891 2018-02-22 03:47:51 My thing is if they ban AR-15s and bump stocks tomorrow, mass shooting will still happen, then what?
5892 2018-02-22 03:47:43 @DLoesch we WILL ban assault rifles, bump stocks, raise the age for purchase, and so very much more. You’re only giving us more fuel tonight #StudentsStandUp
5893 2018-02-22 03:47:18 What the hell do telescopic stocks, barril shrouds, pistol grips have to do with calling these rifles assault weapons? BB  and pellet guns included in your bill? They loo like military weapons too.
5894 2018-02-22 03:47:17 The Republican-NRA response to gun violence will be to advocate arming teachers and sentencing mass murderers to the death penalty.  They might ban bump stocks and raise the age when you  buy a gun.  But banning assault weapons must wait until Democrats take control of Congress.
5895 2018-02-22 03:47:17 Watching CNN’s Town Hall #StonemanDouglas #StudentsStandUp;watch Olympics later. Broward Co Sheriff has better answers than NRA spokeswoman Loesh. He sed build schools diff>make harder 2penetrate; bump stocks & auto rifles shd be banned forever;no sales to 18 yr olds #NeverAgain
5896 2018-02-22 03:47:14 How about this movement come up with some solutions to the problem? So far all we have heard from you is to eliminate butt stocks and not allow Eighteen year olds to purchase rifles. Nothing about arming administrative personnel? Allowing CCW carriers on campus?
5897 2018-02-22 03:47:03 define the upper limits od a civilian weapon. make it a serious felony to modify any weapon above that limit. bump stocks, large cap mags etc. Don't try basing it on a single weapon define the class. Also ammo armor piercing? NO
5898 2018-02-22 03:46:53 Bump stocks are not in any way protected by the Second Amendment. They are not guns; they are accessories. Paleez. KNow when to fold ‘em.
5899 2018-02-22 03:46:47 That is why he is having the appropriate person look into banning Bump Stocks : they allowing a semi-automatic to perform almost like a Machine Gun. Listen to the rate of fire at the Las Vegas Shooting, and you will see. He thought he would get away... he was Wrong!!!
5900 2018-02-22 03:46:41 We need background checks, regulation, AND most importantly to ban these unnecessary weapons of war, assault rifles, bump stocks, high caliber magazines. All of these. You can't just pick and choose Dana Loesch.
5901 2018-02-22 03:46:39 .@DLoesch Your diversion tactics to blame anything but guns do not hold water. You have no shame. No one has a legitimate civilian use for assault weapons, bump stocks, or high-capacity magazines. #CNNTownHall #DefundTheNRA #
5902 2018-02-22 03:46:14 Someone needs to stand up for the mentally disabled tonight in that auditorium. The further marginalization of the disability community must stop.

Get it right. It's the bump stocks, it's the AR-15s. #StudentsDemandAction
5903 2018-02-22 03:46:00 FUCK BACKGROUND CHECKS!
FUCK BUMP STOCKS!

BAN ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS

@CNN @CNNPolitics @TheLeadCNN

#ParklandStudentsSpeak
5904 2018-02-22 03:46:00 They are letting her get away with full blown lies. Who lobbied to strike down federal research, limits on weapons to the mentally ill, who promoted tabling the law banning bump stocks. This is a farce @cnn @jaketapper.
5905 2018-02-22 03:45:53 Nooooooooo Dana you did not answer the question, you did mention bump stocks but did not say anything  about automatic weapons, your just tried to gaslight a teenager
5906 2018-02-22 03:45:43 Acting like it's only a "monster" or "crazy person" that is capable of a shooting is SO IDIOTIC. The Vegas shooter wouldn't have been considered a threat! How would he have been stopped? GUN CONTROL! NO ACCESS TO BUMP STOCKS! NO ACCESS TO ASSAULT RIFLES! @DLoesch
5907 2018-02-22 03:45:40 From a historical perspective, the major bear markets all punished the most successful stocks of the prior era.
5908 2018-02-22 03:45:40 The hard working Americans who deserve tax cuts. So many Americans have gotten bonuses, raises, because of the tax reform. He's brought jobs back to the states, DOW at record heights, the stocks are booming. In a time of dept we needed a smart business man, it's slow, but coming.
5909 2018-02-22 03:45:38 Congrats to Mr Trump, end of bump stocks end of mass shootings!
5910 2018-02-22 03:45:38 @jaketapper ask Dana about background checks for all, large magazine clips, no fly- no buy, eliminate bump stocks Eric
5911 2018-02-22 03:45:35 Making this a mental health issue does not answer Emma's question. She asked specifically about assault weapons and modifications to rifles such as bump stocks.
5912 2018-02-22 03:45:24 @CNN is selling a lot of guns tonight.  Better buy some stocks in S&W tomorrow.
5913 2018-02-22 03:44:51 Bump stocks should be banned. No doubt about it
5914 2018-02-22 03:44:37 Mental health ? Stocks? Higher age requirement? 

What the fuck are we arguing about? 

#ban assault weapons   PERIOD.
5915 2018-02-22 03:44:34 Attorney Gendral alone does not have the power to abolish bump stocks... that needs to come from Congress.... why doesn’t Rubio know this already?
5916 2018-02-22 03:44:27 They're already laughing stocks.
5917 2018-02-22 03:44:20 Rather than be a leader and take action banning bump stocks, requiring every state to perform a background check. banning assault weapons and large load magazines. You want to pass the buck to teachers. Who is getting the students out of the building if a teacher is in a shootout
5918 2018-02-22 03:44:16 #NeverAgainMSD    WATCH WHAT HE DOES, NOT WHAT HE SAYS. 
Only Congress can legislate the legality of BUMP STOCKS & trigger devices, not trump or the Justice Dept. or the ATF. 

STAND YOUR GROUND - USE YOUR VOTE WHEN YOU CAN.
5919 2018-02-22 03:43:47 There is one reason: to assist the disabled.  That, in fact, is the marketing reason for bump stocks.
5920 2018-02-22 03:43:43 The only time I want to hear #bumpstock is if my stocks are bumping up.
5921 2018-02-22 03:43:13 “I own defense stocks” is a sentence I hope no one can truthfully say at some point in the future
5922 2018-02-22 03:43:01 I wonder if Twitter bothered to ask the Patriots they screwed over last night if there portfolio in stocks contain Twitter
...I own several shares Twitter in your Inc
5923 2018-02-22 03:42:53 WHY CANT THEY JUST FUCKING ILLEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS AND AR-15s WTF!!! #StudentsStandUp
5924 2018-02-22 03:42:53 The NRA does not support legislation to ban bump stocks, they support a regulatory motion. #StudentsStandUp
5925 2018-02-22 03:42:50 What I want to know is why @DLoesch didn't point out that bump stocks have ZERO effect on rate of fire?

#NRA @NRA
5926 2018-02-22 03:42:48 They'll throw a few bones like bump stocks and then instill fear in their customers that the gov't will take it all.  Gun sales dipped when Trump was elected - they win either way
5927 2018-02-22 03:42:39 You ask a lot of questions. Let me ask you some: Is tRUmp in on this Parkland false flag? Why doesn’t he do (or even say) anything about it? Is Benedict Donald a double-traitor perhaps? Better go hide your bump stocks, boi.
5928 2018-02-22 03:42:30 No they don't.  Bump stocks don't allow guns to fire anywhere close to the rate of machine guns.  Plus they are almost never used in illegal acts.
5929 2018-02-22 03:42:07 1st the parkland shooter was 19,@ that age can't he buy beer, or a handgun, so why can he buy a rifle. 2nd private sellers @ gun shows don't have to be federally licensed to sell guns, so the loophole does exist. 3rd- compromise ban assault weapons, mags over 10rds&bump stocks.

5931 2018-02-22 03:41:45 I think the laws need to be country-wide, and you need to beef up crimes around the entire thing, but there isn’t one answer to it. Banning bump stocks helps, but what happens when a batterer crosses state lines and obtains a gun legally there? It’s gotta be multi-pronged imo.
5932 2018-02-22 03:41:34 Every night I pray stocks sky rocket #LetGoLetGod 
5933 2018-02-22 03:41:26 bump stocks, and mental health inventories for potential buyers
5934 2018-02-22 03:41:08 Lmao we'll have stocks of bricks by then
5935 2018-02-22 03:41:07 Mags, bump stocks, any aftermarket mod that will increase rate of fire or mag capacity should carry a felony conviction
5936 2018-02-22 03:41:02 Bump stocks is a ruse. Assault rifles should be banned, shooter didnt have a bump stock. Create a bigger police state so people can carry assault rifles. Somehow NRA thinks we're suppose to read people's mind to figure out when they are going to snap. Ridiculous.
5937 2018-02-22 03:40:34 #StudentsStandUp So far, this NRA lady has mentioned nothing about banning bump stocks, assault rifles, etc. She just wants to harp on the shooter's mental incapacity. This is their talking point - it's the crazies, not the guns. Boo to that. It's the fucking guns.
5938 2018-02-22 03:40:28 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
5939 2018-02-22 03:40:24 Its always so quiet there when they say obama did not do anything for 8 years except approve Bump Stocks. They looked amazed to find out the NRA has School Sheild! Hmmmm...what's going on there?
5940 2018-02-22 03:40:20 Now is not the time David for your busllshit. There is not “right” to own assault type weapons as even Justice Scalia said. There is no “right” to bump stocks to make deadly weapons even deadlier. There is no “right” to be free from waiting periods and mandatory checks.
5941 2018-02-22 03:40:13 Dear @NRA the PARENTS ARE SPEAKING
they want better background checks for ALL ppl with guns
they want to raise the age to 21 for semi automatic weapons
they want NO bump stocks
they want NO guns in hands of mentally ill 
#CNNTownHall #ParklandShooting #ParklandStudentsSpeak
5942 2018-02-22 03:40:08 The NRA does NOT support responsible gun laws!!  The nixed legislation on bump stocks behind closed doors, that’s why nothing was brought to the floor after Vegas!
5943 2018-02-22 03:40:07 ~**~*~*it has been half a year since the Mandalay Bay shooting and bump stocks are still not restricted through the ATF the way automatic weapons are, despite most people and the government agreeing that restricting weapons with a mode of automatic fire is reasonable*~**~*
5944 2018-02-22 03:40:04 It is just for bump stocks, @realDonaldTrump, @POTUS, are not going to ban any gun, he might increase the age to 21, for ar15/ak47, but Trump would lose re-election if he did.  Watch out for price gougers.
5945 2018-02-22 03:39:35 just throw in some legislation that wont actually fix the problem. Ban bump stocks. Like you cant modify a gun. Im not some big gun enthisiast but I see where this is going
5946 2018-02-22 03:39:19 A “literal” interpretation of the 2nd amendment “right to bear arms” means any “arms”

If automatic, semi automatic guns, bump stocks & other weapons of mass murder = “arms”

So do bombs, grenades & WOMD.

The 2nd is not meant to be interpreted literally.
5947 2018-02-22 03:39:10 Could b anothr card n the deck. I don’t think it should b mandatory 4 teachers but if they want 2 carry, hav the permit & r trained why not? Also think armed veterans could b anothr card n the deck. Add the ban of bump stocks & enforce the laws already n place.
5948 2018-02-22 03:38:47 This is SO BOGUS. I’m so angry with lawmakers and pundits using that as an excuse; I actually reached out to the ATF to ask about how the review process’s effect on laws being passed about bump stocks, and they said IT HAS NO EFFECT. THEY CAN VOTE ON LEGISLATION.
5949 2018-02-22 03:38:39 “Bump stocks should be illegal. They should be outlawed forever. Automatic rifles should be outlawed forever and anyone who says different, I don’t know about other people, but Emma and I we’re calling B.S. on that”.  Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel
5950 2018-02-22 03:38:36 Did you really manage to misuse both “too” and “to” in the same sentence? And what did I lie about? You’re the one who claimed Democrats paid Republicans not to ban bump stocks.
5951 2018-02-22 03:38:20 Bump stocks need to be banned. That essentially turns a semi auto into a full auto in some aspects. There are laws regarding fully automatic weapons and that should be applied. ( meaning you need a class 3 license to own one)
5952 2018-02-22 03:38:11 It’s not the AR15: that’s just commonly used because it’s easily available &outfited with bump stocks and bullet buttons. Ban that &another becomes popular &outfits are made for it. We need to restrict gun ownership. PERIOD. Stricter licensing, stricter laws, stricter enforcement
5953 2018-02-22 03:38:09 I can live with it.  It’s an easy concession to the irrational Left.  Bump stocks are stupid gimmicks.
5954 2018-02-22 03:38:06 Well they got one right porn has done a lot of damage to perverted minds , now get better BG checks , eliminate bump stocks and 30 rd mags !
Deny ppl on no fly lists ! – bij Andrew Jackson's Hermitage: Home of the People's President
5955 2018-02-22 03:37:55 Yes about bump stocks, but you are misleading everyone about what is in your bill. Why?
5956 2018-02-22 03:37:46 If you can’t get bills passed as a leader of a country it is a clear failure in my regard, whether it’s Trump or Obama and no matter the balance of power. Bump stocks would be a rubbish and extremely light on solution in my opinion anyway.
5957 2018-02-22 03:37:41 So what legislation has Schumer put foreword in Senate to advance his views on gun control that he has the right to rip on POTUS that banning bump stocks aren’t enough?  Curious.
5958 2018-02-22 03:37:39 You can make a bomb at home, but can’t buy a bomb at a store. It’s an attempt at curbing it happening in the future. Bump stocks are still for sale, and they were still used to make semi-automatics shoot like automatics. Would you support a ban on its sale?
5959 2018-02-22 03:37:33 I'm willing to have bump stocks classified as machine guns, even age restrictions on a semi-auto rifles, but I want something in return as part of a compromise.

I want national reciprocity and suppressors deregulated so when people hunt, they don't get hearing damage.
5960 2018-02-22 03:37:30 Not this Congress, at least nothing meaningful. Bump stocks/background check tweak at best. I don't think it will be enough though, but we wont know for sure until we see what turnout is in November.
5961 2018-02-22 03:37:26 A republican senator endorsed:
1) raising the age to buy rifles to 21
2) imposing limits on mag capacity
3) banning bump stocks
4) fixing background checks 

Soooo wtf are you even talking about “these are all a pipe dream” you clown?
5962 2018-02-22 03:37:14 The mentally ill are not all diagnosed & are not all threats! Let’s please not let Dana Loesch, NRA make you think that theyvare root problem.

5965 2018-02-22 03:36:52 They'll make bump stocks the sacrificial lamb and that will be the end of discussion.
5966 2018-02-22 03:36:40 I'm pro gun but bump stocks are senseless. There's absolutely no reason for any civilian to own them. It's not effective enough in a defense situation to be practical or justifiable.
5967 2018-02-22 03:36:35 @DLoesch @NRA You are pretty dense if you think we've forgotten your stance on:

*Bump Stocks
*Background Checks
*Assault Rifles

#ParklandStudentsSpeak #NeverAgain
5968 2018-02-22 03:36:14 Maybe it will change some of the gun laws, ban ARs, ban bump stocks, ban high capacity mags, but that won't solve the problem.
5969 2018-02-22 03:36:12 1) Bump stocks and high capacity mags should be illegal
2) Age of ownership for rifles should be 21
3) background checks should be more indepth
4) All schools should have mandatory metal detection devices THROUGHOUT the campus
5) Teachers should NOT be armed
5970 2018-02-22 03:36:05 there is no reason for citizens to have bump stocks semi automatic, altered weapons of any kind.  #StudentsStandUp #ParklandStudentsSpeak #CNNTownHall
5971 2018-02-22 03:35:59 I’m hearing a lot of talk about preventing people with mental issues from obtaining guns. Well, how can you control an individual who goes insane AFTER he stocks up on weaponry?

5974 2018-02-22 03:34:54 Sorry she didn't say that, at least be honest. She said their stance is to let the ATF decide the fate of bump stocks.
5975 2018-02-22 03:34:52 Buy gun stocks tomorrow sales will spike in the 1st qtr.
5976 2018-02-22 03:34:45 Most recently the NRA is backing a Trump directive to back bump-firing stocks
5977 2018-02-22 03:34:29 Trump does not want to outlaw guns, because his conservative base wants them and he will wiggle & squirm & outlaw bump stocks as a trade, but guns & assault rifles will STAY as a LEGAL alternative because they CASH NRA CHECKS that way. They HIDE behind the 2nd Amendment. #Trump
5978 2018-02-22 03:34:12 what are stocks #ThomasAnswers
5979 2018-02-22 03:34:09 We should all boycott Snapchat and  spike there stocks for giving us this trash update.
5980 2018-02-22 03:34:08 Keep advocating putting guns in classrooms, defending bump stocks, arming mass killers and denigrating shooting victims.  You're doing a great job making the case for amendment.
5981 2018-02-22 03:34:01 Hope you bought gun stocks earlier today. And no, I don't mean bump stocks.
5982 2018-02-22 03:34:00 Broward Co. Sheriff: bump stocks, automatic rifles should be outlawed forever; anybody who says different we're calling BS. #StudentsStandUp
5983 2018-02-22 03:33:58 How many guns did Obama take from You? He didn't take mine. Also, went bump stocks approved during his administration?
5984 2018-02-22 03:33:44 Sheriff Israel straight up said ban bump stocks, ban semiautomatics, and raise the legal age, and then basically high-fived @Emma4Change in Dana Loesch’s face. #NeverAgain #ParklandTownHall
5985 2018-02-22 03:33:43 NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch is asked whether it should be harder to obtain semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks to make them fully automatic weapons. She gives a long speech but doesn't answer the question. What do you think? #ParklandStudentsSpeak #CNNTownHall
5986 2018-02-22 03:33:39 If Trump manages to get a bill to pass about banning bump stocks, then yes, grant him credit for that. Grant him credit too if he makes a serious attempt to pass it and it fails.
5987 2018-02-22 03:33:31 この地合で、ドリコム、ケイブ、ポンイチと頑張ってくれててお父さん嬉しいよ
5988 2018-02-22 03:33:30 Nothing turns"semi automatic weapons into automatic weapons"

Bump stocks make a semi auto rifle shoot faster.
5989 2018-02-22 03:33:21 Am I crazy to think that these kids might actually force legislation? And more than just bump stocks? There's an election coming up, and this story is actually sticking.

Would be something wonderful.
5990 2018-02-22 03:33:21 I LOVE SHERIFF ISRAEL! Ban automatic rifles! Ban bump stocks! No kid under 21 should be able to buy a rifle!#StudentsStandUp
5991 2018-02-22 03:33:20 Dana Loesch is ridiculous. We need to focus more on the argument of the AR and semi-automatic's/automatic weapons. This #StudentsStandUp has been fantastic. Bump stocks, AR's, and anything that can kill a dozen people in a minute should be banned.
5992 2018-02-22 03:33:02 #infrastructure #shipping #stocks $TVOG 
HOTTEST STOCK of 2018!  
5993 2018-02-22 03:32:51 @DLoesch So much tap-dancing, so much shuffling and evasion  -- and the NRA has NOT come out against bump stocks. It has only said bump stocks should be subject to ``additional regulations.'' #StudentsStandUp
5994 2018-02-22 03:32:41 She's up there lying her ass off and no one is falling for her bullshit. The NRA dead ass was fighting against getting bump stocks banned a little while ago. Who she think she's fooling?
5995 2018-02-22 03:32:40 According to @DLoesch of the @NRA, they oppose bump stocks and want to fix the holes in background checks. If that was true, then why are they not telling elected officials to change those laws? #StudentsStandUp
5996 2018-02-22 03:32:25 @DLoesch Too much spin, sweetie. You can’t twist this as a mental problem. This is a gun availability problem. 

National registry
Ban large magazines
Raise the minimum age
Ban bump stocks
Federal background checks

That’s just a start. And find a new job. NRA is cooked.
5997 2018-02-22 03:32:22 Something more than just bump stocks and no fly, no buy.

NICS, new age restrictions, maybe a new assault weapons ban.
5998 2018-02-22 03:32:18 Ok. I agree with all of those. However, I don’t think our government can get that right. Mental health checks would be a great thing. Bump stocks can be made at home very easily.
5999 2018-02-22 03:32:09 Stop talking about bump stocks. Let's address the actual weapon used
6000 2018-02-22 03:32:06 Split hairs all you like. It’s undeniably an assault rifle platform. Politically expedient for the gun lobby to argue semantics but practically speaking the difference is mostly irrelevant in this context (especially when bump stocks are legal).
6001 2018-02-22 03:31:59 @DLoesch is a liar.

If you supported banning bump stocks why did it take you almost 6 months after my cousin was shot in Vegas to do it?
6002 2018-02-22 03:31:58 All these NRA Child Killer tools act like they support bump stocks. However, until the #ParklandShooting that bill couldn't get a hearing in the Florida Legislature.

1. Build schools differently so they're harder to penetrate.
2. Evaluate mentally ill people and take weapons away from those people forever.
3. We do need to have some #GunControl Reform. 18-year-old kids should not have a rifle. Bump stocks should be banned. 1/2
6008 2018-02-22 03:31:29 The NRA is against banning bump stocks #StudentsStandUp
6009 2018-02-22 03:31:23 I can't believe bump stocks weren't banned after Las Vegas.

6011 2018-02-22 03:31:01 The Nifty has a strong resistance at 10430 whereas on the lower side 10300 is the support level for Nifty. Breakout on the either side, will be next make or break levels. #equity #market #share #stock #intraday #cnbc_aawaz #StockMarket #stocks #NSE #BSE #sensex #Futures #Call
6012 2018-02-22 03:30:58 There is no sense in trying to pass dozens of bills to address this problem. Ban bumper stocks, ban sales to mentally ill (needs defining), ban lg capacity clips, foece teachers to carry, paying for it all. It will never happen. Push for banning assult weapons, ban new gun sales.
6013 2018-02-22 03:30:51 While I'm glad he did that, the fact that he's only just now discussing bump stocks this long after the Vegas shooting gives me an inkling of just how high up this issue actually is on his list of priorities.

I genuinely do hope this sparks meaningful, preventative advances.
6014 2018-02-22 03:30:42 Maybe I said it wrong but what I meant was bump stocks that make semi automatic rifles automatic should not be legal. I know it’s not a machine gun jesus people
6015 2018-02-22 03:30:41 You're position wasn't no bump stocks after Las Vegas.

How dumb do you think we are?
6016 2018-02-22 03:30:30 I am all for guns. I love hunting and also believe in self defense and protection. I also do agree in getting rid of bump stocks and automatic guns but....what are we doing about the major mental health issues in this country. Gun control doesn’t fix mental health.
6017 2018-02-22 03:30:28 Oh I agree. I mean Trump took the first step in actually doing something. Bump Stocks although aren’t the main issue is a step to a compromise... hopefully
6018 2018-02-22 03:29:52 I'm kinda pissed she didn't address bump stocks NOT making anything fully auto.
6019 2018-02-22 03:29:45 The Broward County Sheriff finally called BS on the woman from the NRA who would not answer Emma Gonzalez when she asked her if the NRA opposed bump stocks and assault weapons.

Well done!

6022 2018-02-22 03:29:31 What a gift banning bump stocks
6023 2018-02-22 03:29:17 Bump stocks DO NOT convert a rifle to full auto mode.  BTW- A bump stock was not used in this schools shooting so I don't even know why it is even being talked about.  We need to be talking about real security at our schools.
6024 2018-02-22 03:28:57 Emma Gonzalez doesn’t back down, continues to press the NRA rep for an answer about making it harder to obtain  semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks when she tries to avoid a straight answer  Call them out and get them to do something! #GunReformNow #StudentsStandUp
6025 2018-02-22 03:28:49 1.Ban all Assault Weapons
2. Universal Background 
    checks/30 day wait
    limit, when applying.
3. Raise Age Limit to 21 for
     all Gun purchases.  
4. Ban Bump Stocks
5. Close Gun Show
     loopholes.
6. Enforce The Baker Act.
6026 2018-02-22 03:28:49 We love our children but banning bump stocks will not keep them safe. Start a program and hire ex veterans and place them armed in the public schools. Israel does it and no mass shootings. Look closely at who are pushing these protest and using vunerable children 4 their agenda.
6027 2018-02-22 03:28:43 @danaloesch
You disgust me.  

#WhiteHouse Bump stocks and automatic weapons should be banned by executive order today. #StudentsStandUp
6028 2018-02-22 03:28:42 Well @DLoesch, you didn't answer @Emma4Change question did you?  You don't think assault weapons and bump stocks should be more difficult to obtain. #NeverAgain #Townhall
6029 2018-02-22 03:28:21 @Emma4Change, Emma, the NRA representative didn't answer your entire question. She only told you what she believes about banning bump stocks. She said nothing about semiautomatic weapons.
6030 2018-02-22 03:28:16 Let’s see if you keep these students safe. Outlaw assault guns, bump stocks, ghost guns, stricter back ground checks, waiting period before taking the gun out of the store, outlaw gun shows/purchase. Let’s see how strong you are or if NRA wins.
6031 2018-02-22 03:28:09 Now Trump has talked about banning bump stocks (even if this does not get passed) he is responsible for any good that may emanate from that?
6032 2018-02-22 03:27:58 Hence, the reason many white supremacy groups campaigned and supported Trump. They beloved he would favor their race in many instances, which he seems to have done. Now I will say I believe Trump is better than House Republicans as he is willing to take action on bump stocks.
6033 2018-02-22 03:27:54 @Cnn CNN Townhall NRA OPPOSES LEGISLATION ON BUMP STOCKS. Wants regulation only. Sleazy @ForParkland
6034 2018-02-22 03:27:54 Again bump stocks don’t allow you to fire at the rate of a machine gun. It increases the recoil so you can squeeze the trigger faster. Machine guns are fully automatic weapons that you squeeze the trigger once and it doesn’t stop until you release the trigger or run out of ammo.
6035 2018-02-22 03:27:40 @Emma4Change asked Dana Loesch her position on assault weapons and modifications to rifles such as bump stocks.
@DLoesch first became defensive, then danced and danced and danced.
6036 2018-02-22 03:27:35 Beware the NRA and Trump trying to give a little: "bump stocks", something no one ever heard of before the Vegas massacre.  Also a narrow focus on mass shootings while 100s of others die each week.  They will sacrifice this to protect their precious AR-15s and Glocks #NeverAgain

6038 2018-02-22 03:27:31 Dana Loesch and the @NRA look like the evil queen for Sleeping Beauty and her pivot is disgusting. And I love how she lied on National TV about bump stocks and props to this officer for calling her out. #StudentsStandUp
6039 2018-02-22 03:27:29 @CNN 
So...I’m pretty sure we can assume from Loesch’s “answer” to Emma that she does NOT support banning semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks...
6040 2018-02-22 03:27:20 what did Obama do regarding bump stocks?
6041 2018-02-22 03:27:03 They had two years , Obama didn't even try to ban bump stocks after Sandy Hook massacre, which killed 26 ppl.
6042 2018-02-22 03:26:50 thx @charliebilello If we reverse a 30+ year downtrend in interest rates it's bad for stocks. Period. We can wait for a defintive close but don't buy that earnings and tax cuts will carry stocks higher. #BakesTakes_
6043 2018-02-22 03:26:44 Disappointed that Dana didn’t correct the girl who repeatedly misstated that bump stocks make guns full auto.
6044 2018-02-22 03:26:32 .@DLoesch is filibustering. There is no way every diagnosed-after-the-fact "madman" can be spotted and denied a gun before the fact. Semi-automatics, hi-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. need to be more difficult to get whether or not you're a "madman."
6045 2018-02-22 03:26:25 @Emma4Change let her know bump stocks regulations through the attorney general is not a bill. The process trumps wants he knows takes years. And the ATF said they were not responsible for making the chances. It needs to be a bill and signed by trump
6046 2018-02-22 03:26:19 I'll give up bump stocks for national reciprocity.
6047 2018-02-22 03:26:15 Correct. However there needs to be a limit on rounds in a magazine. Anyone saying ban machine guns is just excited that there might ACTUALLY be some traction. Bump stocks are a start. Need better background checks and prohibit domestic abusers from having a gun period.
6048 2018-02-22 03:26:11 HAHAHAHA, your comments ALWAYS good for a laugh because they are false and uninformed. STILL WAITING FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN HOW MUCH OBAMA WAS PAID TO MAKE BUMP STOCKS LEGAL, WHICH LEAD TO 58 PEOPLE DYING DUE TO OBAMAS REMOVAL OF THIS BAN?  I'M OUT! YOU DIDNT SAY A WORD..HYPOCRITE
6049 2018-02-22 03:25:59 Buy more stocks invest more bread !
6050 2018-02-22 03:25:52 I believe in the Second Amendment, however bump stocks, AR-15's -things that are for killing multiple people aren't for hunting food,  Everyone no matter where you buy should have to go through a back round check and a WAITING PERIOD.
6051 2018-02-22 03:25:47 Large capacity magazines, bump-stocks, military-style weapons......none of these belong in the hands of the general public, nor should they be accessible to the general public; although if they want ‘em, they’ll get ‘em somehow
6052 2018-02-22 03:25:39 Did this lady just say that the NRA has been against bump stocks? Not from what the reports have said. #StudentsStandUp
6053 2018-02-22 03:25:35 "CNN Town Hall" Banning "bump stocks" and ANY device that converts a gun to "full auto" should be done immediately, without question!!!  Should have been done long ago, actually...
6054 2018-02-22 03:25:35 Bump stocks are the bone that the NRA wants to throw in order to distract the angry dog.
6055 2018-02-22 03:25:33 I own guns. I'm a gun advocate. But let's not pretend you need bump stocks, 30 rd magazines, silencers(example of logical things banned) for recreational use. People simply WANT those. And the home defense argument is bogus too. If you want to defend your family, buy a shotgun.

6058 2018-02-22 03:25:12 Pressed several times by a student on the issue of bump stocks, NRA spox Dana Loesch repeatedly defers to the ATF. #StudentsStandUp
6059 2018-02-22 03:25:02 Dana Loesch is filibustering. There is no way every diagnosed-after-the-fact "madman" can be spotted and denied a gun before the fact. Semi-automatics, hi-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. need to be more difficult to get whether or not you're a "madman."
6060 2018-02-22 03:24:55 Please tell @DLoesch that the ATF/DOJ HAS NO STANDING TO BAN BUMP STOCKS.  Will be overturned by courts.  Must be Congress.
6061 2018-02-22 03:24:54 Why are these kids asking about questions that don't apply to their school shooting? Bump stocks?
6062 2018-02-22 03:24:53 NRA is willing to give up bump stocks. BFD. This is not a negotiation.
6063 2018-02-22 03:24:44 The NRA and weapons manufacturers don't give two shits about bump stocks. That's an aftermarket mod, they make no money off it.  They'll "compromise" on that because it doesn't impact them, and demand to be seen as "moderate". #CNNTownHall
6064 2018-02-22 03:24:37 Listening to @DLoesch and hearing an absolute liar and bullshitter. Had to take a jab at CNN. Disingenuous. Will NRA support legislation to outlaw bump stocks?? Doubt it!
6065 2018-02-22 03:24:34 He keeps getting richer. Because his company stocks rockets everyday. Simple as that
6066 2018-02-22 03:24:33 I'm not into MLMs, people don't realize how much money you can make trading stocks if you follow the right people/strategies, it makes a lot more sense to make a killing in your day job and invest for the "residual income"
6067 2018-02-22 03:24:32 Ban bump stocks, raise the age to purchase high capacity magazines to 21, greater enforcement of background checks, more coordination with the FBI and local law enforcement, more federal funding for security in schools and 
then nationwide concealed carry reciprocity.
6068 2018-02-22 03:24:27 1. That’s not a solution
2. Spanking kids makes them more violent
3. There are a ton of actual solutions, including universal background checks, gun registration, mental health checks, banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc.
6069 2018-02-22 03:24:25 Little Emma thinks bump stocks make a weapon fully automatic. She's probably flunking her classes.
6070 2018-02-22 03:24:24 Wait...did she ever say what their position was on bump stocks? I'm missing something.
6071 2018-02-22 03:24:23 since when has the NRA opposed bump stocks? such bullshit
6072 2018-02-22 03:24:22 Trump is working to ban bump stocks & other mods that turn guns into automatics and thats a step in the right direction, actually
as much as i hate to say it
6073 2018-02-22 03:24:15 I grew up around hunting rifles. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. I don’t want ALL guns banned. I DO want AR-15s, guns like them and bump stocks BANNED. The AR-15 is the gun of choice of mass murderers.
6074 2018-02-22 03:24:12 And yet bump stocks are selling like crazy, by your NRA members.
6075 2018-02-22 03:24:10 @DLoesch:  The NRA's position has been to ban bump stocks.  @CBSMiami
6076 2018-02-22 03:24:09 going to have to ban fingers,  belt loops and pockets.  All those can produce the same for rate as bump stocks.
6077 2018-02-22 03:24:09 @Tactical_review Bump stocks do not make for fully automatic weapons correct?
6078 2018-02-22 03:24:05 So since @DLoesch won't answer, it seems like the NRA doesn't support banning bump stocks, they support LOOKING INTO banning them. So there's that
6079 2018-02-22 03:23:52 Rubio and any politicians like him need to resign tonight.  These laws to ban assault weapons and bump stocks should be approved immediately.  Pass the damn laws already!
6080 2018-02-22 03:23:41 You can support the 2nd Amendment, and still ban assault weapons and bump stocks!
6081 2018-02-22 03:23:33 I’ve been hearing that they want national concealed carry reciprocity in exchange of a minor sacrifice like bump stocks or modifying background check rules.
6082 2018-02-22 03:23:32 @emma4change to NRA @DLoesch: "I want you to know that we will support your two children in a way that you will not." Asks about banning automatic weapons and bump stocks. #JRN106 #cnntownhall
6083 2018-02-22 03:23:06 .@realDonaldTrump also proposed to regulate bump stocks which was one of your big @DNC moments on Twitter. How about a thank you for his efforts to work together?  #integritymatters
6084 2018-02-22 03:22:26 Stocks that excluded from #Nifty, will perform positively henceforth. Outperformance in longer term time period is irreversible for #Aurobindo @570 #Ambuja @261 #BOSCH @19196
6085 2018-02-22 03:22:23 .@Emma4Change asks @DLoesch if she believes it should be harder people to obtain a semi-automatic and bump stocks. 

#CNNTownHall

#StudentsStandUp
6086 2018-02-22 03:22:17 I'm not against compromising...you want to limit mag capacity? Ok, let's discuss. Ban bump-stocks? Fine. Just jump on AR-15s because its a common rifle and it was used in every shooting? It takes a vile person to murder. Increase the background checks/assesments? Sure.
6087 2018-02-22 03:22:02 How in the world are we talking about bump stocks? Why large magazines? (Both of which are easily made at home, 3D printers anyone?) And of course background checks, duh!

We are going to ban semi-automatic weapons. Full stop. No excuses. 

That is what we should be taking about.
6088 2018-02-22 03:21:40 Rubio gets boos before he even speaks. He recognizes guns were the issue. Rubio believes in not letting 18 year olds get guns, and the ban of bump stocks, stricter background checks and ALL states should report on gun issues. This doesn't sound pro-NRA #233multi #StudentsStandUp
6089 2018-02-22 03:21:33 America won't change a damn thing. There was carnage before bump stocks so it'll have zero impact on the yearly gun violence statistics. It's the guns themselves. And there's no way the guns are going.
6090 2018-02-22 03:21:23 Ehhh, increased age/background checks/no bump stocks/no high capacity magazines is all against their agenda. That’s four good steps.
6091 2018-02-22 03:21:23 CNN Townhall: 
Rubio willing to ban bump stocks, raise age to 21 for rifle purchase, require background checks (maybe).but could not promise to refuse future NRA donations.
#ThoughtsAndPrayersDoNothing
6092 2018-02-22 03:21:23 All this talk of gun control is going to bump stocks.
6093 2018-02-22 03:21:09 Looks like you'll get your wish on bump stocks.
6094 2018-02-22 03:20:51 1) Ban bump stocks
2) Raise the age of buying a gun to 21
3) Universal background checks
4) Temporary restraining orders for guns
Did I miss anything? We’re doing these Monday, right? #TownHallMeeting
6095 2018-02-22 03:20:47 our representatives chose to do nothing about bump stocks after the vegas massacre. now they’re all seemingly on board after 17 kids were killed. you wanna know why? because these students, these survivors are standing up and speaking up and refuse to be ignored. #CNNTownHall
6096 2018-02-22 03:20:40 BUMP STOCKS DO NOT MAKE GUNS FULLY AUTOMATIC.
6097 2018-02-22 03:20:24 Trump made an executive order on reviewing the Application of the Definition of Machinegun to “Bump Fire” Stocks and Other Similar Devices.
6098 2018-02-22 03:20:14 I think any weapon/products designed to make a weapon tactically feasible. Hunting rifle aren't designed for combat use. It's bigger. Harder to shoot. Harder to maneuver. So things like bump stocks, 30 rd magazines etc should be walled behind licenses.
6099 2018-02-22 03:19:58 @realDonaldTrump suggesting banning bump stocks one day and then arming teachers the next is the political equivalent of telling her you don't need to use a condom because you don't have the clap then after you have shot your load revealing you have HIV.
6100 2018-02-22 03:19:47 Logical steps that I have thought of? 1) on any type of SSRI medication. No guns. 2) Control the filth Hollywood pushes out 3) each backgroud check should include a check of all social media platforms 4) discuss possibility of hard placed stocks (reduce ability for high cap mags)
6101 2018-02-22 03:19:41 Trump took the lead on banning bump stocks because Congress would have made it so broad it would apply to most any attachment. His ATF will keep it clear.
6102 2018-02-22 03:19:39 Not sure why a “Protection Bill” can’t be passed. Seems common sense:

1. Universal Background Checks
2. Ban Bump Stocks
3. Raise age from 18-21
4. Ban semi-automatic like AR15
5. Ban ALL open carry at any school

Simple start to something that should’ve been done #gunreformnow
6103 2018-02-22 03:19:14 They are giving these kids lip service. Trump and GOP will give in to bump stocks, maybe just raise the age to buy a gun, and that’s it. Everyone will settle down and nothing else will be done. They will never ban assault weapons. I know it and they know it!
6104 2018-02-22 03:19:13 Bump stocks was the issue in the Las Vegas shooting. Why is the government now focused on bump stocks? Listen to the kids and do something now.
6105 2018-02-22 03:19:07 Hello Aniket! Discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. None-the-less, we offer great deals and discounts quite occasionally. So do keep an eye out for them! :) -S
6106 2018-02-22 03:19:07 NRA: See @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks proves he's not 1 of our puppets.
Trump: hold my #Covfefe
6107 2018-02-22 03:19:02 Trying to sell my stocks has been the most bureaucratic, tiring, lengthy, roundabout bullshit. Even more sure that selling everything for #crypto is the best idea
6108 2018-02-22 03:18:53 a ban is the right thing, however the loophole is bump stocks are not registered. we have no idea how many are out there.
6109 2018-02-22 03:18:52 Now on the debate they are stating they are going to work on: universal background checks, bump stocks, flight weapon bans. All too familiar. Hillary was for all of this & much more but Trumpsters & NRA won’t let this happen bc there’s too much $ to be made from the sale of guns
6110 2018-02-22 03:18:52 Except when a bump stock was used in Vegas, of course. I’m sure you’re for the ban of the production and sale of bump stocks, right?
6111 2018-02-22 03:18:44 I can’t wait until the @NRA Spokeswoman shows up. I’m sure all the liberals will be gracious and applaud her & the @NRA’s decision to support banning bump stocks. 

J/k, they will for sure treat her like shit and demand our guns. #CNNTownHall
6112 2018-02-22 03:18:33 They will address bump stocks, background checks, raising the age for gun purchasing...but no one has committed to banning assault weapons! They need to be clear about that ...RIGHT NOW!
6113 2018-02-22 03:18:31 You’re right. I just think making a blanket statement of “all people who support trump are bad people” is unfair. He has some good ideas (banning bump stocks, etc.) but he has many bad ones too. It all comes down to a conversation. People need to talk about what’s best for all.
6114 2018-02-22 03:18:12 @realDonaldTrump It's not just about bump stocks. It's about NRA money tainting our political agenda preventing "commonsense"  legislation.
6115 2018-02-22 03:18:12 Mamaya po ako mag update ng stocks.. ayusin ko po mna mga habol na reservation... Salamat po.
6116 2018-02-22 03:18:11 I hope beyond hope that MSD students succeed in pressuring Congress to act on banning assault weapons, high capacity magazines & bump stocks. But let’s also not neglect the kids dying every day by hand guns who don’t have this platform and deserve protection and futures, too.
6117 2018-02-22 03:18:09 @TheLeadCNN #Townhall #TownHallMeeting - so next wk they ban bump stocks & the age for buying guns but how does this change all those #assualtrifles already out there?  #GunReformNow #GunContolNow #GunLawsNOW #NeverAgainQandA #NoMore @marcorubio @SenBillNelson
6118 2018-02-22 03:18:01 Bump stocks should’ve been banned after #LasVegasShooting yet it didn’t happen. When will we stand for proactivity vs reactivity????? @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump
6119 2018-02-22 03:17:57 Rubio and any other politician like him needs to resign tonight.  Simple laws to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and implementing background checks should have been approved yesterday.  Talk is cheap.
6120 2018-02-22 03:17:55 @marcorubio will not do anything about Guns, he will support bump stocks ban, background check, etc, but none of it will help while assault rifles R on our streets.The problem is a combination, you can't do one & not do the other. Ban the assault rifles, THAT will fix the problem
6121 2018-02-22 03:17:50 NRA: alright we'll agree on bump stocks
*after tonight*
NRA: wait seriously what
6122 2018-02-22 03:17:44 Will banning any gun take it out of circulation?  Same for bump stocks?  They must be illegal, you must turn it in, if you have one you will be arrested and pay a high fine.
6123 2018-02-22 03:17:32 That’s not an automatic weapon even with a bump stock. A semi-auto weapon means no matter how long you hold down the trigger, only one bullet will chamber, and Fire. Bump stocks (which I’m against) dont do that. Auto weapons would empty the entire clip by holding down the trigger
6124 2018-02-22 03:17:30 #CNNTownHall FL Congressmember @RepTedDeutch says the time for talking about what we're going to do about guns is done, it's over. On Monday, return to Congress, ban bump stocks sand other remedies.
6125 2018-02-22 03:17:25 The NRA is not the enemy nor are guns. We do need better background checks, ban bump stocks, raise age limit, and have better awareness of signs of bullying or alienation of students. Connectedness is new word that makes a lot of sense.
6126 2018-02-22 03:17:14 There’s already been a ruling that DOJ has ZERO jurisdiction over things like bump stocks and other after market gun additives. It MUST be done through legislation.
6127 2018-02-22 03:17:13 The movement to ban bump stocks must be appreciated, but one question about it- how does it matter now?  
If banning bump stocks isn’t an issue, why wasn’t that done when they were used to kill 60 in Vegas? Instead they’re being banned now, after they WEREN’T used. 
#NEVERAGAIN
6128 2018-02-22 03:17:10 Gee, more thoughts and prayers again? And he didn't have to get shot with an AK-15. It's not just about bump stocks. It's about NRA money tainting our political agenda preventing "commonsense"  legislation. It's a 19 year old able to buy an assault weapon.
6129 2018-02-22 03:17:07 A belt loop allows the same rate of fire. Do you plan on them too?  

*extra hint from someone actually educated on firearms... Bump stocks make it tough to aim steadily. The rate of fire + the muzzle rise will not allow an inexperienced shooter to be accurate = fewer casualties
6130 2018-02-22 03:16:54 Gun Accessories should not be covered under the 2nd amendment...large capacity mags / bump stocks / silencers / etc...Ban them, raise Federal age limit to 21 for all rifles (unless active military) & tax the crap out of bullets!!!
6131 2018-02-22 03:16:49 Ban AR-15s, AK-47s, bump stocks, require universal background checks, etc., and when the next mass shooting occurs, and it will, maybe then we can focus on the real issue -- why these folks feel killing is a reasonable solution to their problems.
6132 2018-02-22 03:16:46 Yes, so you wake up tommorrow and ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, strengthen and enforce background checks, implement tighter security at entrances to schools, and implement improvements to mental health systems in this country. There's no time like now.
6133 2018-02-22 03:16:35 Looking at outsized moves in various consumer stocks ($Fosl, $wmt, etc) positioning into earnings by people using credit card and location data is making the sector uninvestable.
6134 2018-02-22 03:16:32 In the markets, "CHOP" is a 4 letter word.   #stocks #investing
6135 2018-02-22 03:16:19 Quantitative Easing. Buying debt securities..forcing investors into risky asset classes while country balance sheets debt levels balloon and a new generation believes all stocks should sell at 30x EPS.
6136 2018-02-22 03:16:15 these liberal windbags need to shut up about banning bump stocks and background checks.  banning assault rifles is the battle to be fought. full stop. #Townhall #NeverAgain
6137 2018-02-22 03:16:07 We can’t settle for fixing background checks and bump stocks and walk away to pat ourselves on the back. Those are layups that the #NRA will smile abt back at headquarters Dems are negotiating with themselves again #CNNTownHall #ParklandSchoolShooting #GunReformNow
6138 2018-02-22 03:16:07 But assault weapons are really just semi autos with plastic crap hung on them. You can do the same with a Browning BAR or Rugar Mini 14. And a m1 Garrand would make Ar15 look like a bb gun. None are considered Assault rifles as they usually have purdy wooden stocks.
6139 2018-02-22 03:15:56 oo nga eh. will try my luck :( sana meron. i think limited lang din yung stocks sa store nila sa incheon airport :( pero ipila natin 'to sa itaewon hahahahahaha
6140 2018-02-22 03:15:35 @realDonaldTrump Donald stop the sales of assault weapons,  BUMP stocks, etc. You can do it.
6141 2018-02-22 03:15:09 This turd Deutch knows nothing about weapons. Keeps saying weapons of war, no civilian can legally own military grade weapons. Bump stocks are stupid but they only make a weapon shoot one round at a time faster.
6142 2018-02-22 03:15:07 @marcorubio I'm following you now Mr. Rubio. 

I hope your attention span is longer than 7 days. Continue "rethinking" and OPPOSING the sick positions of the NRA has. 

MANDATORY BACKGROUND CHECKS

BAN BUMP STOCKS

ELIMINATE THE LOOPHOLES

BAN ASSAULT RIFLES.
6143 2018-02-22 03:15:06 Don’t be fooled: banning bump stocks and banning people on the “no fly list” from getting guns is the bare minimum of gun control.
6144 2018-02-22 03:15:05 RT @SenFeinstein: Machine guns have been banned for decades but a loophole in the law allows bump stocks. These dangerous devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the rate of machine guns. Our bill is the only way to ban them. #StudentsStandUp
6145 2018-02-22 03:15:04 Watchin Rubio try to impress angry teens by telling them he is considering changing his position on bump stocks and using gentlemanly language about his fellow senators is great TV. #CNNTownHall live
6146 2018-02-22 03:15:03 I stand with students NATION WIDE for safe schools!  BAN the AR-15 and bump stocks!
6147 2018-02-22 03:14:56 STOCKS-Рынок акций РФ поднялся во главе со Сбербанком
6148 2018-02-22 03:14:55 Bump stocks are used for people that are handicap or have one arm and if I’m correct they were not even used in Vegas those guns were on tripods they were just there everyone I know that was in Vegas at the time said there was more than one shooter police refuse to listen
6149 2018-02-22 03:14:54 Ive offered plenty of solutions. More extensive background checks, getting rid of bump stocks which really doesn't do anything at this point, enforcing current laws, better reporting by mental health into NCIS, better mental health care, getting rid of gun free zones. Yours?
6150 2018-02-22 03:14:52 in his bio he put “Photographer/Videographer/Stock Market”  i can tell u know like nothing about stocks
6151 2018-02-22 03:14:50 He said he wants to ban bump-stocks too
6152 2018-02-22 03:14:50 Now that they are trying to ban bump stocks what's going to be done to the FBI for not doing their job? NOTHING????
6153 2018-02-22 03:14:38 STOCKS-Рынок акций РФ поднялся во главе со Сбербанком
6154 2018-02-22 03:14:34 Banning "bump stocks" is nothing more than a knee jerk or token measure that will not accomplish anything. I have said for the last 30 years that we should secure our schools, events, etc. Now, it looks like that message is being received. #SeanHannity
6155 2018-02-22 03:14:29 Rep Deutsche just said bump stocks convert AR-15s into killing machines.  Implying they weren't before.  Contradicts himself.  Person is the killer, gun is the tool.    #treattheproblem
6156 2018-02-22 03:14:27 If you take away the bump stocks and the high-capacity magazines, all you're left with is a gun that can single-fire a few rounds without being reloaded, just like any pistol. If you want to restrict them based on their "vibe," at least you're honest.
6157 2018-02-22 03:14:21 Fl Rep Deutch: next week Congress should ban bump stocks, enact universal background checks, ban those who can’t fly from buying guns , CNN
6158 2018-02-22 03:14:10 @marcorubio Why are you talking down to these students?...Short attention span, bump stocks and 21 year old killers, instead of 18 year old killers? #voteRubioOut
6159 2018-02-22 03:14:09 Bump stocks are just a tool. It takes training ap practice to rapid fire with any kind of accuracy. The bump stock is not a magic device
#StopDemLies
#RemoveSenFeinstein
6160 2018-02-22 03:14:07 Rubio says he believes there are the required 60 votes in the Senate to raise gun-purchase age to 21, and to ban bump stocks. President Trump has expressed support for both a bump-stock ban and age-limit increase. One obstacle to the latter: NRA opposition
6161 2018-02-22 03:14:06 This shooter and others need to not be able to purchase them. Period. Get the AR-15 and others off the market. If you’re on a terror watch list, you shouldn’t be able to get a gun. Ban bump stocks. Raise the age limit. Licensing. Background checks.
6162 2018-02-22 03:13:56 Bump stocks should be banned IMMEDIATELY  #StudentsStandUp
6163 2018-02-22 03:13:51 Exactly Peggy.  Multiple mass shootings when BHO was President, and no fix made!

Watch how DJT will provide a fix!  He's open to several solutions: incr. background checks; incr. age limit; prohibit bump stocks.
But adding security is the only one that will make a difference!
6164 2018-02-22 03:13:49 Bonds first Pete, then stocks, then gold and BTC, then QE 4&5. Then gold, silver, and BTC (BCH IMO) to the Moon. Then man to the Moon, then man to Mars. Then to the Stars.
6165 2018-02-22 03:13:42 Is that literally all theyre talking about? Bump stocks and background checks? goddamnit. Thats......crumbs.
6166 2018-02-22 03:13:36 Bump stocks, and semi automatic rifles do not belong in anyone's hands. The weapons are for war, nothing else.
6167 2018-02-22 03:13:35 Rep. Ted Deutsch pointing out that bump stocks could have been addressed months ago. Background checks years ago. 

He's right, we're in a Groundhog Day of gun safety, it keeps being brought up after each massacre, but nothing is ever done. #StudentsStandUp #NeverAgain
6168 2018-02-22 03:13:32 Bump stocks shouldhave been ban after Vegas long over due assault rifles are the true common denominator #StudentsStandUp
6169 2018-02-22 03:13:29 You need to ban bump stocks yesterday, not next week!

#StudentsStandUp #CNNTownHall
6170 2018-02-22 03:13:26 The fact that bump stocks were ever legal  automatic weapons might as well have been legal too.
6171 2018-02-22 03:13:06 Ban bump stocks
6172 2018-02-22 03:13:00 But bump stocks have not been used in the majority of mass shootings, while these events can still be very high-casualty. Reintroduce your nationwide Assault Weapons Ban to halt the effectiveness of these massacres!
6173 2018-02-22 03:12:44 @RepTedDeutch You are correct. There is no reason this can't be a sprint. Overwhelming majority of Americans support background checks, mental health checks, and banning bump stocks. Congress needs to do it now! #StudentsStandUp #NeverAgain
6174 2018-02-22 03:12:33 Semi-auto weapons need to be banned as well. It's not enough anymore to go after bump stocks.
6175 2018-02-22 03:12:32 Obama did do one thing with guns, he allowed bump stocks to be manufactured.
6176 2018-02-22 03:12:30 Banning bump stocks and moving the age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 is like being at the bargaining stage of "That hot dog will be $500 . . . okay, fine, $450."
6177 2018-02-22 03:12:29 .@RepTedDeutch: Banning bump stocks? We don't need to *think* about that. We need to do that...NEXT WEEK!
6178 2018-02-22 03:12:26 Only one party has continually blocked any sort of changes that might actually make a difference...it’s been 6 months and bump stocks are still legal...this should have been the easiest legislation ever...

6181 2018-02-22 03:12:16 They should just pass a law outlawing bump stocks, it will work almost as well as the laws against methamphetamine.
6182 2018-02-22 03:12:11 Trump's decision to ban bump stocks should've been made law 4 months ago after the Las Vegas Massacre. Why is it taking so long to enact common sense gun laws? #StudentsStandUp
6183 2018-02-22 03:12:03 @marcorubio believes there are enough votes to ban bump stocks and to raise the age for obtaining AR 15s,  This is a NO BRAINER, and should be done TOMORROW, but encouraging nonetheless.
6184 2018-02-22 03:12:02 stocks need a bump
6185 2018-02-22 03:12:01 Says he’s reconsidering. He has worked out the way the wind is blowing politically and wants to own the narrative. The NRA have told Trump and co they can give up bump stocks in order to save Automatics. None of them should be let off the hook.
6186 2018-02-22 03:12:00 #StudentsStandUp and expose the massive flaw in American democracy: legislative votes are for sale to the highest donor. The swamp is full of dollars. Bump stocks were supposed to disappear after Vegas. Only these students shaming politicians will make real change.
6187 2018-02-22 03:11:53 #StudentsStandUp bump stocks are low-hanging fruit, as are background checks.  Don’t stop kids, you can make real change here.
6188 2018-02-22 03:11:52 Marco continues to evolve even more into the guy I wanted to be president. I’m all for everything he just said (bump stocks, 18-21 age raise)
6189 2018-02-22 03:11:51 @NRA has nothing to do with this. Its an issue with screenings, sales under the table and pure evil.  The NRA forces no one to take money. Ban the high capacity magazines & bump stocks if you want to start gun control. The Va Tech shooter killed 30 with pistols Not AR'S.
6190 2018-02-22 03:11:50 I like how Rubio says “I believe *we* have 60 votes in the Senate to ban bump stocks” as if it is his party who’s going to vote for it.  Reality is it’ll be all Dems voting for it and maybe 10 R’s who wish to anger their base
6191 2018-02-22 03:11:47 Then why did your husband Barrack approve Bump stocks!!!!!
6192 2018-02-22 03:11:45 I wish I weren't so old and cynical, but here I am: nothing is going to change regarding guns. 'Bump stocks' (whatever they are, I don't speak NRA) were supposed to be the gun lobby's sacrifice after Las Vegas. This time won't be any different.
6193 2018-02-22 03:11:43 How many bump stocks have been sold since the Las Vegas massacre?
6194 2018-02-22 03:11:41 Banning bump stocks is like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound #neveragain #cnntownhall
6195 2018-02-22 03:11:40 At any time did anyone bring up how the NRA supported regulation on bump stocks? #StudentsStandUp

6197 2018-02-22 03:11:38 Yes, Representative Deutch, we DO need to draft laws NEXT WEEK that help with background checks and banning of bump stocks is in place. #ParklandStudentsSpeak
6198 2018-02-22 03:11:34 Banning bump stocks was proposed but dems weren't happy with that, they had to load the bill up with all kinds of crap they knew wouldn't pass. Shut up with this lie, congressman. #CNNTownHall
6199 2018-02-22 03:11:31 We needed to ban bump stocks the day after Las Vegas!! They’re still legal today. #CNNTownHall
6200 2018-02-22 03:11:30 Bump stocks aren’t what convert semiautomatics into killing machines. 

THEY ARE ALREADY KILLING MACHINES.

6202 2018-02-22 03:11:18 You can deduct $3,000 of losses per year. You can also use these losses to offset any gains you may have made from other capital assets like stocks
6203 2018-02-22 03:11:17 For the record, bump stocks should have been outlawed the day after the Las Vegas shooting, or, ya know, 10 to 20 years ago. #StudentsStandUp
6204 2018-02-22 03:11:13 Gun control measures @marcorubio has pledged to support in #CNNTownHall: 
*Strengthen background checks 
*Ban bump stocks 
*Change age from 18 to 21 on the purchase of any rifles 
*Limit magazine stock sizes (maybe)

6212 2018-02-22 03:10:52 You’d BETTER have 60 votes to ban bump stocks, institute better background checks, ban assault rifles, or else it is bye-bye in 2018.

6216 2018-02-22 03:10:39 You can say ”you believe” the Senate will give 60 votes to banning bump stocks and raising the rifle purchase age to 21, but we all know you’ll turn around and vote against both bills. #CNNTownHall #StudentsStandUp
6217 2018-02-22 03:10:38 Rubio is literally sweating bullets, making promises to raise the age to 21 to purchase guns, end bump stocks, reduce magazine size (all in the next few weeks).  Wow, the NRA must be very scared.  Too bad, it is too little, too late.  

Vote out the NRA politicians in Nov-2018.
6218 2018-02-22 03:10:22 OK after this seeking , what was the Obama solution ? We all recall he legalized bump stocks though . No one remembers a single thing in 8 yrs . Maybe you can fill us in ?
6219 2018-02-22 03:10:09 Rubio says he believes the Senate does have 60 votes to ban bump stocks -- the devices used by the shooter in the Las Vegas massacre last October.

6222 2018-02-22 03:09:49 "Ban guns" will get nowhere. Here's what could:
1. Require biometric guns so only owners can shoot them
2. Universal background checks.
3. No sale till check completed.
4. Ban hi-cap mags.
5. Checks for all purchases of more than 100 bullets.
6. Ban bump stocks.....
6223 2018-02-22 03:09:45 Why not ban ALL auto/semi-auto fire arms? Ban bump stocks & other enhancements which alter firibg power? Close gun show loophole?
6224 2018-02-22 03:09:37 If the only change in law that passes is bump stocks then Trump will take full credit
6225 2018-02-22 03:09:34 Sen Marco Rubio says believes 60  votes in Senate to ban bump stocks, raise gun purchase age to 21, CNN
6226 2018-02-22 03:09:32 Takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun it's common sense. So sick of the gun control agenda and very dissapointed in the NRA and President Trump for considering a ban on bump stocks. People pay thousands a year to the NRA to protect there 2nd amendment rights.
6227 2018-02-22 03:09:27 @marcorubio how are there not 100 votes to ban bump stocks???? Oh the NRA....
6228 2018-02-22 03:09:25 Changing the age for 18 to 21yrs to buy an assault rifle doesn't really solve the problem. Look at all the workplace killings. How about we ban military assault rifles and bump stocks?
6229 2018-02-22 03:09:11 .@marcorubio thinks there are 60 votes in the Senate to ban bump stocks. Then let's do this, Congress. #StudentsStandUp
6230 2018-02-22 03:09:10 @realDonaldTrump  Banning bump stocks isn't a solution, it's a stepping stone for the left's march down the road to confiscation.
6231 2018-02-22 03:09:08 Ay @marcorubio 

BUMP STOCKS AINT THE ROOT ISSUE. ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE.
6232 2018-02-22 03:08:57 I believe they will the the bump stocks ban to something heinous and then wail when it doesn't pass.
6233 2018-02-22 03:08:54 Now, talk on magazine sizes and bump stocks-- sorry I wasn't listening to much to this part-- the GOOD thing is that since this is a town hall, students/audience that have let their anger start to disrupt discussions were shushed BY THEIR PEERS. This is a GOOD RESPECTFUL SIGN.
6234 2018-02-22 03:08:54 @realDonaldTrump HOW can you WEAKEN already weak gun laws now? You have to commit a school shooting to be denied access to a weapon, and maybe not even that. Bump Stocks are not even the issue, but I encourage you to do this. Also, suppressors are insane to legalize. #NeverAgain
6235 2018-02-22 03:08:52 Bump stocks and minimum age...okay. Keep going!
6236 2018-02-22 03:08:45 Paul Ryan will not put bump stocks on the House calendar.
6237 2018-02-22 03:08:29 Nope. Not this time, not next time, not ever. The gun lobby writes massive checks, students and teachers don't have any money and everyone has short memories. Remember how they were going to ban bump-stocks after Vegas? Yeah...
6238 2018-02-22 03:08:27 Start with stronger screening procedures, loosening restrictions on reporting of mental health issues, national age for purchase of rifles to 21, restrictions on high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, consider banning assault weapons.
6239 2018-02-22 03:07:21 I'll do this to you for all 4 of your stocks
6240 2018-02-22 03:07:00 Magazine clip size, assault weapons, bump stocks are only an issue in the USA (maybe). Please learn from other nations and start protecting your citizens rather than placating the lobbyists. #NeverAgain
6241 2018-02-22 03:06:24 Only 2 points 2make about "it's" comments regarding "gun control" His memorandum asking the AG 2 see what can be done 2 prevent bump stocks from making their way 2 AR-15's its illegal. That's an act for Congress not the executive branch. As for arming teachers with glocks. Lunacy
6242 2018-02-22 03:05:40 Bump stocks. Background checks. Restraining orders. Arming teachers. High-capacity clips. Gun show loopholes. Assault weapons. But whats an assault weapon? Baby steps. Or "more than a 5k race" as @marcorubio would say. While more Americans die! #BanAssaultWeapons #StudentsStandUp
6243 2018-02-22 03:05:19 Military also have Glock or Sig Sauer handguns as a side arm and those are “weapons of war.” I’m just looking for common ground: universal bkgrnd cks, no bump stocks, mental hlth/domestic violence, proficiency req, databases talking.
6244 2018-02-22 03:05:17 I’m also all for waiting period, background checks, etc. Trump actually just started a ban on bump stocks too, which went completely unnoticed by Twitter.
6245 2018-02-22 03:05:16 I absolutely do not think they're meaningless. And they'll never support any regulation, no matter how small and how commonsense. The "bump stocks" rhetoric was just that--if there was ever a credible chance of it happening, they'd find a reason to oppose it.
6246 2018-02-22 03:04:43 I hope you will now move forward with reasonable gun control legislation...ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles, buy back assault rifles currently held by public, and put some real teeth in background checks!

Not arming teachers.
6249 2018-02-22 03:03:42 Stoked @Stash will be offering fractional shares of stocks. Kudos, well played by listening to your audience. #contentmarketing
6250 2018-02-22 03:03:17 Bump stocks will not be missed. They’re absolutely a cause to waste ammo. Trump should just ban the sale of them to hush up some of the anti gun folks
6251 2018-02-22 03:03:16 It feels great now, but closer to elections we wont be able to say " no one wants to take your guns"  if we keep demanding it now.  I  think a realistic goal is no more than 10 rnd magazines, no quick release mag catches, no bump stocks or crank, bkgrnd chks & wait prds.
6252 2018-02-22 03:02:36 So @realDonaldTrump is for regulating bump stocks but @BarackObama ok’d them. Does that mean republican leadership is for more gun control than hypocrite democrats?  #thinkaboutit #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #MyPresident

6255 2018-02-22 03:01:30 That’s just ignorant!  Very ignorant of what the NRA does and supports. They support safe and legal gun ownership. Gun safety is one of their biggest platforms. They supported a ban on bump stocks years ago!  They are people, gun owners !!
6256 2018-02-22 03:01:14 Because it’s expensive and unnecessary.

1. Ban bump stocks
2. Fix the NICS database. 
3. Have states implement GRVO laws. 

There. With me?
6257 2018-02-22 03:01:12 A ban on bump stocks removes one of the two things from the market that should be removed (with High Capacity Mags). It is a fight almost as important as tougher gun aquisition legislation.
6258 2018-02-22 03:00:59 Exactly; bump-stocks are just an advantage to a rifle. These bump-stocks are accessories that can help increase the rate the rounds of ammo are being shot out.Bump-Stocks and semiautomatic assault weapons shouldn’t even be purchased in any shape or form.
6259 2018-02-22 03:00:54 I think you're being naive. We'll be lucky if they can pass legislation to ban bump-stocks, tighten background checks and close the gun show loophole. There is no serious proposal to "get rid of them." However you think that would work, you're deluding yourself. #SecureTheSchools

6269 2018-02-22 02:58:11 @SenateMajLdr it's time to cut ties with the NRA and ban Assault Rifles, bump stocks, raise the age limit for gun purchases, and require background checks at trade shows. We demand change. Protect my children while they are at school.

6271 2018-02-22 02:57:09 @donlemon Reason Trump and other politicians will talk about banning  Bump stocks and back ground checks is because it doesn,t affect the NRA,Bump stocks had nothing to do with the latest school killings
6272 2018-02-22 02:57:07 At least he got them together and is listening, it’s a starting place which is more than any other sitting president has ever done. He is also possibly going to sign an executive order banning bump stocks if congress can’t get a bill passed which is highly likely

6274 2018-02-22 02:56:46 Cant wait to read the bill. I hope it includes bump stocks & conversion parts. 

Too many guns become rapid fire by altering them with after-market parts.

There is NO need for military grade weapons in society.

They are a death tool, plain and simple.

Got it @NRA ?? @GOP ??
6275 2018-02-22 02:56:33 It's not enough. Ban ALL military grade assault rifles, semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks. Why would any non-military civilian NEED that kind of firepower, other than to kill as many people as possible?
6276 2018-02-22 02:56:18 NRA:  Hide your military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks, because 16- and 17-year olds in this country are going to be voters soon, and they're gonna be "gunning for you".

6279 2018-02-22 02:55:09 the thing is, i think that argument is nonsense and most people know exactly what they want regulated. they want magazine capacity limits, and they want to get rid of overtly dangerous bullshit like bump stocks.

6285 2018-02-22 02:53:56 Doesn't answer why bump stocks are so bad they need to be banned.
6286 2018-02-22 02:53:47 The GOP needs to raise a vote to ban weapons built for assault...also known as weapons of war (on our children).  They've missed the window on bump stocks with NO ACTION after the Vegas murder spree.
6287 2018-02-22 02:53:42 I'm not a gun expert, but what does it prove to ban "military-style" rifles? Should we ban camouflage lighters too? Seems this energy would be better served getting back to bump stocks/high-capacity magazines.
6288 2018-02-22 02:53:38 Heard this today..."investing in ownership is the only way to make big profits". Business, real estate, or stocks. Business, more specifically Entrepreneurship, is of course the hardest of all three. #FoodForThought
6289 2018-02-22 02:53:28 Please add your voice to the growing list of senators supporting the children of Parkland. As a mother, I demand action. We want better gun control, ban bump stocks, assault rifles, and protect the kids. There are no weapons allowed inside federal buildings, they deserve the same
6290 2018-02-22 02:53:24 Arm teachers? I have a much easier, safer, cheaper solution: BAN ASSAULT RIFLES LIKE THE AR-15! BAN BUMP STOCKS. GET RID OF THE DICKEY AMENDMENT. REQUIRE BACKGROUND CHECKS INCLUDING A MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT & A GUN LICENSE FOR GUN OWNERSHIP.
6291 2018-02-22 02:53:24 Just a strategy I’m trying based loosely on 20/80 rule of @option_snipper . As I can’t xfer gains to bank account due to being an IRA, I continue “transferring” to long equity positions in buy/hold stocks & ETF/index funds. Akin to having 2 sub-accounts within single IRA.

6311 2018-02-22 02:49:55 I think this crowd was ready to pound on Marco Rubio, but he has mostly said things appeasing to the crowd, going against the NRA on several issues (bump stocks, arming teachers most notably). It will be interesting to see how the NRA spokeswoman responds when she sees the crowd.

 Ban assault rifles, semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks. Seems pretty straightforward to the majority of Americans. 

Of course, the NRA didn't GIVE US $32MILLION, so we're not beholden to them.

6325 2018-02-22 02:48:28 On the issue you are concerned about now, Trump said to ban bump stocks. But he also said that we should have some armed teachers at each school.
6326 2018-02-22 02:48:24 I confess, as a normie, I had never heard of bump stocks until Las Vegas. Thing is, those "it's a clip, not a magazine!" folks knew about bump stocks all along. And they did nothing to keep their fellow citizens safe. There's your "responsible gun owner" for you.
6327 2018-02-22 02:48:06 Obama’s ATF gave the green light on bump stocks dummy. Any serious shooter only considers them a novelty. Why don’t you just come out and say what you really want banned Ed?

6329 2018-02-22 02:47:43 NOW 15.56

A speculative stock is a stock with a high degree of risk. May offer the possibility of substantial returns to compensate for its higher risk profile.

Speculative stocks are favored by speculators and investors because of their high-reward, high-risk characteristics.
6330 2018-02-22 02:47:38 Trump knows congress must stop the use of bump stocks, and that he has been loosening background check since taking office, and no one wants John Wayne Rambo, for a teacher!
6331 2018-02-22 02:47:36 yeah this is my thought re stupid shit like bump fire stocks and trigger cranks. understand the desire to push back on literally any regulation, think many proposals are halfbaked / vanity but the NRA's solid wall against any regulation is a double edged sword.
6332 2018-02-22 02:47:28 @cnnbrk Reason Trump and other politicians will talk about banning  Bump stocks and back ground checks is because it doesn,t affect the NRA,Bump stocks had nothing to do with the latest school killings
6333 2018-02-22 02:47:21 They wouldn’t solve it. Just make it worse. Just an easy sound bite for NRA that gets more guns sold and solved nothing. NRA is not sure how much to give up. Already said bump stocks to offer an olive branch
6334 2018-02-22 02:47:19 reminder:
ONLY reason #FatNixon brought up background checks and bump stocks is NRA sees them as giveaways that do not stop gun sales. both could have been passed months ago.
6335 2018-02-22 02:47:17 He actually had both branches of government for a few years. If it was so important to him and the Dems, they could have pushed it through. But Obama was the one who legalized bump stocks, which can turn a gun into an automatic weapon.
6336 2018-02-22 02:47:07 Reason Trump and other politicians will talk about banning  Bump stocks and back ground checks is because it doesn,t affect the NRA,Bump stocks had nothing to do with the latest school killings
6337 2018-02-22 02:46:42 I propose all semi auto rifles & hand guns you must be 21 yr old to buy.
Ban bump stocks completely.
Limit magazine size to 30 rounds.
Make ALL gun and ammo purchases need back ground check.
Also we need mental health screeni g and treatment under a universal medicaid/medicare
6338 2018-02-22 02:46:36 Meaning that bump stocks don’t go on automatic weapons so I’m sorry for any fellow Gun supporter who sees that and thinks I’m a liberal
6339 2018-02-22 02:46:30 Were there millions of them like the AR15’s?

Were civilians allowed to have them?

Were they sold at the General Stores like candy?

Were they used to slaughter children in the late 1700’s?

Did they come with ‘bump stocks’?

Try harder, dude.

Do something about guns..support bump stocks! REALLY We want to know the NOW. NO SUPPORT for doing away with ASSULT RIFLES per RUBIO!
6346 2018-02-22 02:44:47 Trump is wanting to get rid of bump stocks, but it seems like no one is giving him credit for this. You can give credit where credit is due, and yet still push for more change. Humans are weird.
6347 2018-02-22 02:44:15 Why do bump stocks need to be banned?
6348 2018-02-22 02:44:07 All these Liberal Idiots using Parkland Shooting to blame Trump who just got into office...And Dumbass Dems owned All 3 Judiciary’s under Obama and didn’t do Jack Shit on Bump Stocks, Ak-15’s, nadda! 

DUMB DUMB LIBS Never miss an opportunity to use Emotions bc of lack of Brains!
6349 2018-02-22 02:44:07 You just need to calm down and breathe. No one is going ban firearms. However, bump stocks aren't firearms. Anything that turns a firearm into an automatic weapon isn't a firearm. If you have a problem banning those then you need to answer a few questions!
6350 2018-02-22 02:43:47 Please don’t let us down! Improve & mandate background checks- no more gun show loopholes. Minimum age of 21 for any gun purchases w/licensing & training. Outlaw bump stocks, all assault weapons, & high volume magazines. Start there!
6351 2018-02-22 02:43:39 TRUMP SAID HE WANTED HIS AG TO BAN BUMP STOCKS BUT BACK IN 2013 THE AG SAID NO THIS WAS SONETHING CONGRESS  HAS TO DO .SEN FIENSTIEN HAS A PROPOSAL WHICH WAS DEFEATED BY THE GOPIN 2013.WHY? THE NRA FUNDS REPUBLICANS &TRUMP,THE NRA FUNDS THEIR CAMPAIGNS ASK TRUMP HOW MUCH
6352 2018-02-22 02:43:24 Agreed.

Bump stocks much? If you aren’t at that level of nuance, you should shut up. People are dumb.

6355 2018-02-22 02:42:23 Let's Be Clear: Lip licking liar @marcorubio will support raising age to purchase long guns, banning bump stocks, and expanding information available in background checks, like he supports immigration. IOW, lip service only. #GOPLies #VoteOutGOP #ParklandStudentsSpeak

6358 2018-02-22 02:41:53 Rubio, Trump, and other Republicans are only offering tiny concessions like banning bump stocks and raising the gun purchase age to 21 because either a) they are offering something trying to wait this out or b) they know they can't wait it out this time.

6360 2018-02-22 02:41:39 I’m not sure what the argument is? No one including Senator Feinstein has said they want to ban all guns. Ban assault rifles, Ban magazines, bump stocks. Weapons that cause high speed rapid killing power. I don’t think a responsible gun owner would object. (1)
6361 2018-02-22 02:41:12 You are correct, Ann, except that bump stocks should go....and I don't think you oppose that ban.  Further gun restrictions will ONLY effect good, responsible owners.

6364 2018-02-22 02:40:49 You are not a politician Mr. President, you owe the NRA nothing. Psychologists now say that adolescence is 13-24 years of age. We are selling weapons to children who are immature and 2 dimensional in emotional development. Why do people need bump-stocks? You can do something!!
6365 2018-02-22 02:40:10 Never said ban guns. We could however ban hi-cap mags, ban bump stocks, demand universal background checks, and increase penalties for illegal possession to name a few. And in 2018 biometric guns sales should be the norm.
6366 2018-02-22 02:40:08 I feel for these kids but ain't nothing gonna change. 
Ban bump stocks, how many you ever seen at a range?

6367 2018-02-22 02:40:02 You only need to make one big score in finance to be a hero forever. #trade #forex #stocks
6368 2018-02-22 02:39:27 I believe that you should be required to pass some sort of gun safety class before being allowed to own a gun. And a regular average joe should NEVER have a tactical assault rifle, such as an AR-15. High-cap clips and especially bump-stocks should also be banned.
6369 2018-02-22 02:39:02 No legislation today allows anonymous free speech on social media to be the sole cause for anyone buying AR-15s, extended clips, hollow rounds, bump stocks and body armor.

Gun violence restraining order? Marco (swooning), "Oh my, that's so hard!"
But we have that in CA
+ 10 day waiting period
+ 10 round magazine limit
+ (new) background check on ammo purchases
+ (oldie) Bump stocks outlawed since 1990
Just ask, Marco, we'll set you up
6371 2018-02-22 02:38:30 Trump called upon his attorney general to do something about “studying” bump stocks that is the equivalent of studying to see if wheels are cars should be round or square. We know the answer. No study necessary.
6372 2018-02-22 02:38:20 Global Cues(US Markets)
U.S. stocks erased gains to end lower for a second day
Dollar jumped with Treasury yields 
Speculation that the pickup in inflation signaled by data since the Fed last meeting will force a faster tightening schedule.
6373 2018-02-22 02:38:17 Nice fact twisting. The Obama administration only said they determined they couldn’t prohibit the sale of bump stocks under the current law. And it wasn’t used in this school shooting, it was used in Las Vegas.
6374 2018-02-22 02:38:09 Banning bump stocks used in Vegas, banning large capacity magazines, and felony charges for adults when minors use their weapons in the commission of a shooting. /2
6375 2018-02-22 02:38:09 So much for Bill of RIGHTS RT @GiffordsCourage: .@marcorubio voices support for: 1) no longer allowing 18-year olds to buy semi-automatic rifles
2) ban on bump stocks
3) improving our background check system. 
#CNNTownHall #VoteCourage
6376 2018-02-22 02:37:56 But the conversation is slowly shifting. From assault rifles to bumper stocks and mental health. That makes me sad.
6377 2018-02-22 02:37:55 Not true.  Many states allow Title 2 fully auto weapon ownership.  Oh, and 'bump stocks' ya know....which allows cyclic rate of fire even without modifying the receiver.
6378 2018-02-22 02:37:34 Even if there is something DOJ can do about bump stocks, we need Congress to act to have lasting change, something that cannot be eliminated by an executive order. #maddow
6379 2018-02-22 02:37:23 I know what you’re saying obviously. Again you or I would never have a chance to get the permit. And they’re banning bump stocks soo...? Is anything ever good enough for u ppl??
6380 2018-02-22 02:37:05 the pic i posted yes 7y but my boy got a size 9.5 in the same box
6381 2018-02-22 02:37:04 Banning bump stocks is just a itty bitty part of what needs to be done!
The NRA thinks if they relinquish "something/anything " we will all slink away and be satisfied.

6382 2018-02-22 02:36:43 @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Arming Teachers is not the answer. Limit access to semi auto weapons. Definitely age restriction. The school had a guard. He just wasn’t in the right place at the right time. So that’s not an option. Ban bump stocks. No need for those.
6383 2018-02-22 02:36:38 Their pain is real and needless. 21 yr minimum age to purchase. Ban the bump stocks and assaults. Background checks Must have info received from school counselors & police, fbi, mental health advisors taking 3 day minimum to check, fingerprinted
6384 2018-02-22 02:35:45 Just like stocks at the draft it's good to pick a variety of choices, some with long term investments that hope to pay dividends in draft+5 to 6 years which typically are the smaller type players. Which is why having Benning at the helm is superb for a stable successful franchise
6385 2018-02-22 02:35:38 .@realDonaldTrump’s answer to the 18th mass murder in an American school this year is to ban bump stocks, about 0.000001% of the problem, or put more guns in schools for the teachers, or have ex-military sitting in schools waiting for the next mass murderer.
6386 2018-02-22 02:35:17 Stocks of gun companies will be in toilet Thursday. I had the yucky job at one time of representing gun companies via doing their ads and pressers. Many SHOT shows I had to attend and they made me ill.
These kids are really making a difference. The time is now.
6387 2018-02-22 02:35:06 #ThomasAnswers How do you use stocks?
6388 2018-02-22 02:34:45 Please do what you said you'd do. Please protect our children. Please ban assault rifles, semi automatic weapons, bump stocks etc. Please require background checks at trade/gun shows. Please work towards better communications amongst state & federal law enfcmt. Save these kids!
6389 2018-02-22 02:34:40 @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, if you help pass any type of anti-gun legislation, such as bump-fire stocks, I will not be voting for you a 2nd term.  Guns are not the issue with these school shootings, a lack of security is.  A security door or armed guard is the answer.
6390 2018-02-22 02:34:38 I like adding stricter gun regulations. A searchable national database of owners. A national ballistics search engine for all manufactured weapons. 7 day waiting periods. Elimination of all High power rifles. Banning bump stocks. Increasing funding for mental illness. And more.
6391 2018-02-22 02:34:11 Per @marcorubio -
1. No rifles for 18 & under
2. Ban bump stocks
3. More info on background cks
4. All states req/incent 2 report
5. $50m/yr thru Sandy Hook Ini 4 threat assessment 4 all states
6. No belief in weapon ban due to 200 vs 2000 inc in law
#CNNTownHall #Parkland
6392 2018-02-22 02:33:48 @governorjerryb 
When U go 2 D.C. 4 Gun Safety Conf, pls stand 4 the max solutions, i.e., ban semi-automatics, bump stocks, funding 4 mental health part of background checks, investigate ANY reports abt threatening behavior, age limits, waiting period, NO LOOPHOLES, etc. THANK U!
6393 2018-02-22 02:33:24 Bump stocks. Most all are okay with banning that. Legislation in place. Know your terminology man. You can place bump stocks on any semiautomatic (or in other words; hunting) rifle.
6394 2018-02-22 02:33:17 Bump stocks do not convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon. There were no automatic weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting. Bump-firing is a rapid-firing technique, not a technology. Bump stocks make it easier to bump fire, but aren’t necessary or sufficient.
6395 2018-02-22 02:32:57 Bump stocks are really just a gimmick but it’s the principal
6396 2018-02-22 02:32:53 Bump stocks not used in #ParklandShooting. Military grade weapons do not belong in USA.
6397 2018-02-22 02:32:34 Would what you do with stocks like FAT and IME  be considered swing tracking penny stocks? I assumed most people only day trade those type of stocks. If so, would it be something you’d do again? Too risky?
6398 2018-02-22 02:32:22 Quit focusing on the age. Its the weapon. Military grade assault weapons are not intended for civilian use and should be limited,  including modification devices. A 65 year man with bump stocks massacred 50 people in LV.  21 yr old req. wouldn’t have saved those lives.
6399 2018-02-22 02:32:14 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 8,514.08 down 99.57 points or 1.16 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
6400 2018-02-22 02:32:13 Perhaps incentive to manufacturers is putting any given weapon into a more restricted category if there are known easy conversions, ie bump stocks. Perhaps that would tighten up the incentive on engineering.
6401 2018-02-22 02:32:12 7/11 fully trained to act upon a violent crime/shooting and for them to be allowed to carry a firearm and act accordingly. Every school to have at least 2 uniform police officers or former military veterans protecting the schools. I will also say the use or sale of bump stocks
6402 2018-02-22 02:31:52 If NRA members were true Americans they would bring all their AR15’s, extra capacity clips and Bump Stocks to CPAC. Show the world what freedom means.. Charlton Heston would be so proud.
6403 2018-02-22 02:31:40 This crowd at #StudentsStandUp want every semiautomatic rifle banned. This is why even banning bump stocks won't satisfy the left. Hope @realDonaldTrump understands that.
6404 2018-02-22 02:31:37 Are you serious? Bump stocks are less than 0. GOP is having a litmus test moment of truth w/voters and failing miserably. Trump is reviled by 60%+. America is not a right wing country, it’s a centrist country which has lost its way thanks to bitter partisanship.
6405 2018-02-22 02:31:36 @realDonaldTrump You know damned good and well that Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III CANNOT DO SHIT ABOUT BUMP STOCKS. Only CONGRESS. Where were @SpeakerRyan And @SenMajLdr  because they sure weren’t there today. DEMAND A BILL FROM CONGRESS or admit that you’re lying. #maddow
6406 2018-02-22 02:31:14 I propose that our first move as T&C ent is to buy an A/C, second move should be investing in hunus stocks until we own enough of the company to stage a coup d'etat
6407 2018-02-22 02:31:12 @marcorubio I agree that if you have to ban ar-15, then you have to ban all weapons of similar caliber like the ak-m etc. banning one gun stops nothing. Banning bump stocks I agree with, but banning one rifle does nothing.
6408 2018-02-22 02:31:01 Ban every semi-automatic weapon and any weapon that can do the same damage that AR15s can do—assault rifles and all weapons of war. Keep simple hunting rifles. Ban bump stocks.
6409 2018-02-22 02:30:48 An AR 15 is technically a civilian weapon now. Bump stocks do need banned yes but banning guns isn't going to stop the issue at hand.
6410 2018-02-22 02:30:45 Ban - ALL MAGAZINES AND BUMP STOCKS!!!
6411 2018-02-22 02:30:34 Pre approved concessions by the NRA fed to Rubio & his ilk. The NRA gave up virtually nothing (gun manuf.  don’t make bump stocks & the same number of guns will eventually be sold) and those politicians they’ve bribed get to claim they’re doing something.
6412 2018-02-22 02:30:18 ドリコム、ホンマにゆっくりでええんやで。
6413 2018-02-22 02:30:01 Of course he's full of sh*t. The Repubs are trying to win over voters before November elections. Trump is doing the same thing. He's "listening" to the kids and he's talking about banning bump stocks. Repubs will hold out actually doing anything until after November. Am I wrong?
6414 2018-02-22 02:29:56 TGOD will be a monster IPO - still wondering about pricing. Cannabis stocks are still hot.
6415 2018-02-22 02:27:56 Although, some ideas I do like. Like a ban on bump stocks and on ghost guns.
6416 2018-02-22 02:27:23 Turning teachers into police officers is not the answer!

~Change law (ban) AR-15 from 18 to 21

~ Pass & fully fund Universal Background Checks

~Integrate Mental Health Check System

~Ban “Bump Stocks”

~Fix gun loopholes buyers/sellers

6422 2018-02-22 02:25:43 And bump stocks!!! Oops those were legalized under obama w a dem Congress. Interesting that was used in the school shooting

6424 2018-02-22 02:25:21 Rubio at #CNNTownHall says he’d support banning of bump stocks, changing background checks
6425 2018-02-22 02:25:17 @POTUS
If bump stocks are banned, that will immediately ban other items.  No rifles for 18 year olds? But they can use a full auto in combat in the military?

BAD DECISIONS HERE, DON'T FORGET IT'S THE PERSON, NOT THE GUN.

DON'T GIVE UP OUR #2A RIGHTS!!!
6426 2018-02-22 02:25:06 .@CNN Hey @marcorubio! I call your bullshit! We don't give a damn about plastic stocks and loophole smokescreen bullshit. Limit ammo capacity or ban semi automatics. #StudentsStandUp #GunReformNow #ParklandStudents

6436 2018-02-22 02:23:53 @marcorubio We want a total ban on semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. First World countries that have done this have few, if any, mass shootings. IT WORKS. STOP LYING you weasel!  You are an accessory to MURDER.  #Rubio

6439 2018-02-22 02:23:05 Trump probably wants to regulate "bump stocks" because he thinks they're sexual aids.  #maddow
6440 2018-02-22 02:23:00 The Obama administration had already asked the Justice dept to pass regulations of bamp stocks. Not done by Justice only Congress can.
6441 2018-02-22 02:22:47 Does anyone take seriously the blather abt strengthening backgr checks? Don't look now, but Cong recently declined to prohibit ppl with history of mental illness from purchasing guns. And bump stocks? How many shootings (not incl Las Vegas) can you name that involved bump stocks?
6442 2018-02-22 02:22:38 Sen. Rubio says he’d support raising the age for buying assault weapons and says he’ll support banning of bump stocks.
6443 2018-02-22 02:22:31 .@realDonaldTrump @POTUS says he wants the @TheJusticeDept to ban bump stocks. But, legally, they can’t. Congress has to do that. The question is, will they? What he says vs what reality is. They don’t match.
6444 2018-02-22 02:22:00 Rubio is delivering what has de facto become the GOP reponse on gun control post-Florida at this CNN town hall: Raise the age to buy assault weapons, add more information to background checks, ban bump stocks, and that’s it
6445 2018-02-22 02:21:52 Actually, assault rifles are banned from civilians. It's the semi-automatic weapons and the add-ons like bump stocks we should be focused on.
6446 2018-02-22 02:21:28 Don’t let bump stocks be the decider in this ban of assault weapons #ParklandShooting bumps stocks have nothing to do with banning guns. Bump stocks is an added device to an assault weapon.
6447 2018-02-22 02:21:26 Just received a telemarketers phone call from NY. They were conducting a survey on bump stocks and AR 15's. If your interested in being heard, I suggest you answer. They were polite.
6448 2018-02-22 02:21:18 Banning Bump stocks- is blowing smoke. Same thing after #LasVegas #GunContolNow #cnn
6449 2018-02-22 02:21:18 Gentle reminder that bump stock bans won't prevent domestic abusers from shooting their partners or themselves. Yes, we should ban bump stocks. But it isn't much, and it's being offered up as "reasonable" because gun supporters know it isn't much.

6452 2018-02-22 02:20:53 Before this reaming began, Rubio did just cross the NRA twice by saying 18 year olds shouldn’t be able to buy rifles and saying he’d ban bump stocks by legislation
6453 2018-02-22 02:20:53 The solution to mass shooting is simple.
1. School/ college going kid, mentally unstable person, criminals not to be allowed Gun.
2. Banning of Bump Stocks.
3. Strong background check for Gun aspirants.
4. No donation from NRA allowed.
5. No military grade gun for anybody.

6460 2018-02-22 02:19:41 I refer to them as "Obama stocks", since they were made legal during his regime. 

Anyone ever stop and think why this was done?  

Why would the left allow a modification that turns a semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic one, which by law is extremely difficult to get?
6461 2018-02-22 02:18:46 This #CNNTownHall is no joke so far. And Marco Rubio apparently can’t let go of that sweet NRA money. They must’ve been pretty clear with their demands bc if you can say bump stocks should be outlawed but NOT assault weapons, there’s a problem.
6462 2018-02-22 02:18:45 Rubio says problems can’t be solved by gun laws alone, but says he will support banning bump stocks and changing background system #CNNTownHall
6463 2018-02-22 02:18:34 Congress is hoping we forget. How long ago was Vegas shooting? Only now they're thinking of getting rid of bump stocks.

6467 2018-02-22 02:18:02 Rubio: supports age limits on rifle sales, banning of bump stocks. Doesn’t believe assault weapons ban would have stopped it. #CNNTownHall
6468 2018-02-22 02:17:59 He also mentioned he would be okay with changing our background systems to include more information than it does now and banning bump stocks #RWUJour
6469 2018-02-22 02:17:49 You bitch a--es wouldn't even ban the bump stocks until the 1 trillionith school shooting. You made it easier for mentally ill people to get guns #StudentsStandUp
6470 2018-02-22 02:17:47 Hey. Lil' Marco the president by law cannot ban bump stocks.
You are either stupid or lying.
6471 2018-02-22 02:17:43 look worse?? Great tax plan that helped almost every tax payer, more cash every week, stocks cruising, economy rolling, they will improve backgrounds. They will get a DACA deal to make permanent fix. Even more seats will go red in November.

6474 2018-02-22 02:17:31 .@marcorubio says he will support 1) no assault weapons for 18 yr olds, 2) ban on bump stocks 3) better information into background check system but NOT a ban on assault weapons #StudentsStandUp
6475 2018-02-22 02:17:29 Every single politician who takes money from the terrorists at the @NRA better be watching the #CNNTownHall, and see what is happening.  THIS is how the country feels.  #NoRA.  Bump stocks are not enough. Age limits are not enough.
6476 2018-02-22 02:17:27 On CNN's Townhall in Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio voices support for ban on bump stocks
6477 2018-02-22 02:17:20 Rubio in his opening didn't mention any initiative at all on gun control, whether it is increasing age limit, abolishing bump stocks, mags, or semi-auto rifles. He is weak.
6478 2018-02-22 02:17:20 Good for @marcorubio for banning of bump stocks and age limits #CNNTownHall
6479 2018-02-22 02:17:13 Father of a child murdered at Stoneman Douglas. “Guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids. Look at me and tell me you will do something about guns.” Rubio says he’ll support banning bump stocks, increased background checks. #StudentsStandUp

Dad: Were. guns. a. factor??

Rubio: of course they were.  I will support a law that takes away rt to buy a rifle at 18, bump stocks, and boosting background checks.
6482 2018-02-22 02:16:47 @marcorubio you’re about to lose your job. Bump stocks were zero factor in this. No one needs Assault weapons. #throwhimout
6483 2018-02-22 02:16:44 Only banning of bump stocks. But no banning of AR-15.
6484 2018-02-22 02:16:43 Bump stocks was not an issue in this shooting #StudentsStandUp

How about starting with banning ASSAULT weapons, bum stocks & making it hard to get deadly weapons? #NeverAgain
6489 2018-02-22 02:16:31 Rubio comes out for raising the age for buying rifles and for banning bump stocks legislatively under INTENSE questioning from the father of a slain student.
6490 2018-02-22 02:16:29 Start with banning weapons of WAR from our streets: assault rifles, bump stocks #StudentsStandUp
6491 2018-02-22 02:16:27 @marcorubio says he supports raising the age minimum for purchasing firearms and banning bump stocks. #StudentsStandUp at the CNN Town Hall
6492 2018-02-22 02:16:26 .@marcorubio says he will support increasing the age to buy a rifle, banning bump stocks and background checks.
6493 2018-02-22 02:16:25 Oh just the banning of bump stocks? I can’t wait for these students to be able to vote  #StudentStandUp

6495 2018-02-22 02:16:19 .@marcorubio says he supports law raising the age to buy a gun, supports banning bump stocks, expanding background checks #CNNTownHall
6496 2018-02-22 02:16:10 Having some popcorn and having a calm night, watching some Olympic action, wondering what stocks will do the last two days of the trading week?
6497 2018-02-22 02:16:07 They don't value the gun as much as they value the money. The more mass shootings, the more panic of gun bans, the more the stocks go up. Feb 14 SWHC was $10.17/share, Feb 16 $10.91. That's a 7% return in 2 days. If someone had $100,000 invested, they made $7,000 from shooting
6498 2018-02-22 02:15:47 Ban bump stocks and assault rifles
6499 2018-02-22 02:15:34 Duh.  We figured that out the instant he talked about bump stocks.  Keep up @chrislhayes
6500 2018-02-22 02:15:33 Because 65 year old men with bump stocks dont commit mass murder.
6501 2018-02-22 02:15:20 Trump proposing a ban on bump stocks is like me proposing the bank to give me a million dollars
All talk!!!
6502 2018-02-22 02:15:09 Agreed! If the prez has the guts to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, raise the age for buying a regular hunting weapon to 21 and fix the cracks in the background checks, he will be loved. NRA opposes raising the AR15 buying age to 21. Prez needs the balls to back them down.
6503 2018-02-22 02:15:07 Security at schools. We protect money, sporting events, red-carpet events, etc. why are we NOT protecting our kids? Murderers don't obey laws. I'll go for a higher gun purchase age, no bump stocks but in the end, we need school security, not "gun-free" zones no criminal obeys.
6504 2018-02-22 02:15:00 Obama approved bump stocks because he hoped that they would create mass shootings. Since that didn't work, he's resorted to using FBI/CIA operatives to use the mentally ill to do it.

6509 2018-02-22 02:13:54 I think we're close to being in agreement on something.... However, before "assault weapons" can be eliminated they first need to be clearly defined. Do I think that my friends need a safes full of "assault rifles" configured with bump stocks and other modifications? HELL NO.
6510 2018-02-22 02:13:18 Yeah, but first it's bump stocks, then what? It makes me feel nervous.
6511 2018-02-22 02:12:52 What do mandatory background checks on ALL sales, waiting periods, national gun registry database, mental health screenings, training and banning large capacity magazines, bump stocks and “assault rifles” have to d with abortions?
6512 2018-02-22 02:12:42 Like you’re gonna go 100 tweets without mentioning weed stocks
6513 2018-02-22 02:12:36 @realDonaldTrump  I understand that you are in favor of universal background checks and banning bump-stocks. Good for you, sir.
Please follow through. This will be a good start.
#ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunReformNow #KillTheNRA
6514 2018-02-22 02:12:31 Banning bump stocks is meaningless and Trump knows this.  Because they can be 3D printed by anyone with a couple hundred dollars to spare.  Ban the guns.
6515 2018-02-22 02:12:03 Your president spent 14 mins with the victims in the hospital in between tee times!Obama cried, listened and tried to do something (made bump stocks illegal, trump undid that and then reinstated it as if it was his idea)If you want to see how a real president acts, look up Obama
6516 2018-02-22 02:11:55 Ineffective is a strawman. Other countries made effective laws and we could too if we didnt have such a fetish &corruption. GOP, meaning the NRA, refuse to even consider supporting supporting elim of bump stocks and binary trigs and equally cycle time avg improving magazine cap.
6517 2018-02-22 02:11:46 Stocks To Watch

    Vardhman Special Steels raised Rs 50 crore via QIP.

6519 2018-02-22 02:11:36 The point is bump stocks dramatically increase the firing rate

6522 2018-02-22 02:09:53 Memories always vary. I was 14, walking passed a major hotel when a fleet of Cadilacs pulled up. It was Billy Grham & his entourage. More Caddies than a car dealer stocks. Thought, "Wow, how many collecton trays does he pass around."
6523 2018-02-22 02:09:45 Invested in myself and watched the stocks raise 
6524 2018-02-22 02:09:42 What a whipsaw in the US Markets last afternoon.Up 300 points to down 160. 

Fed meeting minutes triggered buying programs,bond yields went down and Dollar fell.

Then the whipsaw. Stocks, Gold down,Yields and Dollar up.

6530 2018-02-22 02:07:08 I could see him consulting with NRA, asking what he could do. They give in on bump stocks & say teachers need guns. #gunsense
6531 2018-02-22 02:06:46 Was she in awe when her husband lied & said Ft. Hood was workplace violence instead of a terror attack? Was she in awe when her husband lied when 4 Americans died in Benghazi and he blamed it on a video? Was she in awe when the Obama Admin approved bump stocks?
6532 2018-02-22 02:06:39 Yes, a good session w .@POTUS .  BUT, talk is cheap, as we've heard about solutions dozens of times or more! Can ANYTHING really be done or passed in Congress! OK, your challenge is ON! My short list to get SOMETHING done: 1-bkgnd chks (incl. within families), 2-bump stocks, ...
6533 2018-02-22 02:06:11 I would highly recommend following @alessiorastani on twitter and youtube. His charting charting and explanations are top-notch.

6536 2018-02-22 02:05:24 Are we taking bets that @DLoesch says the same thing? My guess is she'll argue that bump stocks are not the problem because one can use an arm motion to get the same effect! She'll argue that the govnt can't pry the guns out of our hands, and she'll definitely call for more guns!
6537 2018-02-22 02:05:22 You people will get nothing. Not even a ban on a bump stocks
6538 2018-02-22 02:05:10 President Trump,
Please remember your voters! Please refrain from compromising on gun control. Give us National Reciprocity and anyone upset (like myself) about your position on bump stocks will come back. Arm our teachers and end the shooting gallery that is the gun free zone.
6539 2018-02-22 02:05:09 Want to know the answer? ban all assault type rifles, they should only be for military use,  and I am talking any large capacity magazines , also the bump stocks should be banned , they turn semi automatic to fully automatic, we are talking 500-800 rounds a min,
6540 2018-02-22 02:05:08 "We are nation's leading provider of independent, unbiased, trusted ratings of Stocks, Mutual Funds, Cryptocurrencies, ETFs, & Financial Institutions." ... I call bullshit!
6541 2018-02-22 02:04:55 Look, Cliff, The founding fathers never could have imagined the lethality of something like an AK-15 as they had muskets only.  They couldn't have imagined bump stocks neither.  You hide behind your illusion of a right.  Blood, blood, blood.
6542 2018-02-22 02:04:49 Make stronger background checks that also require family members to vouch for you as a fit and responsible gun owner.  Realize that ASSAULT style weapons, bump stocks, and XL magazines are not needed for protection or hunting EVER. They are big boy toys only and need to be banned
6543 2018-02-22 02:04:19 So glad you remember right now, because in 3 days it will be a distant memory that didn't happen. Along with you saying you are banning bump stocks, that you alone can't do.
6544 2018-02-22 02:03:41 Sell your stocks now! 
6545 2018-02-22 02:03:09 Porn is a lot more dangerous once you add the bump stocks.
6546 2018-02-22 02:02:58 As you've probably heard, Trump supporters are being censored to an insane degree. I can't defend @POTUS without my comment being isolated (shadow banned). If he switched to @getongab for a week and announced it(and why), Twitter stocks would plummet. Just a thought.
6547 2018-02-22 02:02:17 As of 10:00 a.m., PSEi 8,536.19 down 77.46 points or 0.90 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
6548 2018-02-22 02:02:04 As much as I want to, I don't think I'll ever understand stocks.
6549 2018-02-22 02:01:28 Mike you know I'm not a POTUS fan but today he finally in my opinion got it right. Hopefully the simple things will get through ie bump stocks ban and mandatory waiting period and deeper background check. Assault rifle ban reinstated is a great step too
6550 2018-02-22 02:01:11 Proud of having voted Trump after that listening session.  It was exactly what was needed.  And the changes he's proposing are more than Obama and #Dems did in eight long years. Can you imagine, they never even bothered to ban bump stocks. #ParklandStudentsSpeak
6551 2018-02-22 02:00:59 Nobody is “fooling us” Dave. We knew better. They told us they were going to make life hell on their platform for certain users. Let’s revisit this when their stocks TANK and bury them, like Air America did in the 90’s. Sorry but these little brats are PUSSYS. I hope they choke.
6552 2018-02-22 02:00:50 Old guy I work with always said he wished he'd bought more 30's back in the early 80's.  Now he won't even look at bonds.   Says why give his money to someone else to use for nothing.  Spends his time looking to write puts on stocks he wouldn't be embarassed to own.

6554 2018-02-22 01:59:54 Yes, however your one suggestion is ludicrous. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks...simple. Oh yes, return any NRA money you received for your candidacy then resign.
6555 2018-02-22 01:59:47 We want a total ban on all semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Countries that have done this have few, if any, mass shootings.
6556 2018-02-22 01:59:45 #Stocks,#Indexes AND, the next top signal probably will be a MAJOR top signal-- the likes of which signaled the SPX, NDX 2813, 6881 tops, respectively (see chart of 02.15 post).
6557 2018-02-22 01:59:17 That’s OK Scotty.A lot of people made that mistake who will never make it again. Instead of tweeting on this how about stating your thoughts on some form of ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. Of course I know that’s hard when your beholding to those great people at the NRA
6558 2018-02-22 01:59:04 There's not one single silver bullet. It's going to take a lot of things. My God you can't take guns away from people. That could  tear the country apart . Tougher background checks, get rid of bump stocks, red flag laws, protect our kids with armed guards.
6559 2018-02-22 01:58:19 I mean you didn't contextualize your comparison between stocks/bonds/crypto. You said nothing of portfolio performance, only that Bitcoin was less volatile.
6560 2018-02-22 01:58:18 Then DO something!  Ban assault weapons, ban high capacity magazines,ban bump stocks, tighten background checks. You CAN do this.    more @nytimes
6561 2018-02-22 01:57:46 Tapping in my #IRA to get stocks any events I'll put on for my city  note on positivity Boss Moves only  !
6562 2018-02-22 01:57:04 Let teachers teach, not become armed guards.  Ban assualt weapons, and bump stocks, improve gun laws, have a national ground check that is tough on peoplr with violent histories, even in childhood
6563 2018-02-22 01:57:02 2) Arming teachers in the US is probably not a good idea. Let’s at least fix the low hanging fruit, like age limit, bump stocks, 30 round mags etc.
6564 2018-02-22 01:56:54 @WH Please work with Congress to ban the sale of AR-15s and similar assault style weapons, bump stocks, any handguns or semi-automatic weapons to people under 21, or any gun to anyone who is being treated for a depression or other serious mental illness.
6565 2018-02-22 01:56:31 now we'll play the art of the deali'll make money and you sell more at-15's bump stocks toooevery body happy but the soon to be DEAD
6566 2018-02-22 01:56:19 You made a big show about finally discussing the banning of bump stocks. 4 months after Vegas, those victims can’t be too happy that it took another shooting to finally address bump stocks.
6567 2018-02-22 01:55:46 Maybe Donnie wants them to have bump stocks on those guns as well.
6568 2018-02-22 01:55:42 Kind of ironic (or is it idiotic) that pro-gun YouTubers who are showing how crazy Bump Stocks are vs standard stocks in increasing shots/min & diminish accuracy, turn around & say, "I don't want to get involved w/ the debate" but there is "few sane ppl out there" #GunControl

6572 2018-02-22 01:55:19 Ok, now the murderous N.R.A. has expressed their negative feelings about trump wanting to ban bump- stocks . Does trump have the balls to tell the N.R.A. to fuck off?
6573 2018-02-22 01:54:42 When asked if banning bump stocks, tighter background checks , raising age to 21 would be good, Democratic senator Blumathel said , ITS A START ! Nothing will make the DEM'S  happy
6574 2018-02-22 01:54:39 Yeah by eliminating Bump stocks. That will not solve the problem. Just White wash.

6576 2018-02-22 01:54:27 Then distance yourself from the NRA and make some Federal laws that require universal background checks and take AR-15s and bump stocks off the shelves.  You won't be running for a second term so you owe the NRA nothing.
6577 2018-02-22 01:54:21 I am X Military, Own Weapons and a Member of The NRA. I don't see the necessity for Bump Stocks, that being said, hundreds of fully automatic weapons crass the Southern Border illegally every month. If you really want Gun Control, Build The Wall.
6578 2018-02-22 01:53:55 Keep them safe by banning military style assault weapons! Ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines! Ur idea about arming teachers is beyond crazy. You have no clue of what needs to be done.

6580 2018-02-22 01:53:43 @realDonaldTrump Parkland was a tragedy no doubt (FBI, where are accomplices?). Forget bump stocks, not important. But most important: 2A intact is H U G E. Vetted, armed professionals at schools is best solution.  USN CPO, Ret. sends...
6581 2018-02-22 01:53:41 WHY did you sign that bill allowing the mentally ill to buy guns? BAN assault weapons, up the buying age to 21 and BAN bump stocks. Show some spine. It could save your presidency.
6582 2018-02-22 01:52:53 Richard - I've supported legislation to close background check loopholes, to ban bump stocks, and to reinstate the assault weapons ban.

And I'm demanding my Congressional colleagues join me in supporting these changes that could save lives. #NeverAgainQandA
6583 2018-02-22 01:52:22 #Stocks,#Indexes  Incipient bottom signals today aborted after the reaction to the Fed  minutes.  Bottom signals nearly always follow selling, however, so they  may be the next reaction. In any event, no rally as strong as the  current one ends sans top signal.
6584 2018-02-22 01:52:19 Front row stocks obviously running horribly low to even consider him. Only ? on the chooks. If JWH  or Napa are out for any length of time they're in trouble.
6585 2018-02-22 01:52:17 We can start by expanding mental health funding, eliminating bump stocks, universal background checks & assault weapons ban. #CNNTownHall
6586 2018-02-22 01:52:09 yes... IF you know what you doing and if you are going to stay there a long time (7+ yrs) as a primary residence.

6589 2018-02-22 01:51:51 He just directed the AG to eliminate bumps stocks and is willing to increase and improve background checks. So don't accuse him of doing nothing it makes you look foolish

6591 2018-02-22 01:51:26 "Ban guns" will get nowhere. Here's what could:
1. Require biometric guns so only owners can shoot them
2. Universal background checks.
3. No sale till check completed.
4. Ban hi-cap mags.
5. Checks for all purchases of more than 100 bullets.
6. Ban bump stocks..... to start

6595 2018-02-22 01:50:52 It's interesting that the proposed solution of arming teachers and staff, only benefits the NRA. They would make money. Profits and stocks would go up. NRA would become more powerful, but students, teachers and staff are still not safe.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

6597 2018-02-22 01:50:25 Lmfao like I said, you have no right to tell people how to defend themselves they have a right to defend themselves how they see fit. And no, Trump actually like the idea of ending gun free-zones and endorses the idea of letting teachers arm themselves. Bump stocks are still here
6598 2018-02-22 01:50:18 Nothing wrong with that. I've been to a shooting range before and fired a handgun. We still need stonger legislation (universal background checks, regulations on ar-15 style weapons, no bump stocks or bump stock like tools).
6599 2018-02-22 01:50:03 MR. PRESIDENT! You have a chance here to make a name for yourself as a great President who changed the course of history. Please change gun laws. Change the legal age for gun purchases. No bump stocks.
6600 2018-02-22 01:49:54 I agree, don't arm teachers. Secure campus entry points, expand background checks, increase age to 21, ban bump stocks, fund mental health, put a couple marines on campus (after they pass screenings), etc. There are plenty of options short of arming teachers or repealing #2A.
6601 2018-02-22 01:49:47 Yes !  Trump has stocks in the NRA.
6602 2018-02-22 01:49:39 You know the problem is a lot more urgent than what people think and that’s one of the options. Doing that in tandem with tighter background and removal of bump stocks. I mean give the guy a chance.
6603 2018-02-22 01:49:34 Imagine how you'd feel as a teacher, if you tried to kill a shooter and instead shot a child...how does that play out in the media? No auto or semi-auto guns, smaller magazines, no bump stocks.  If we could at least start with that...
6604 2018-02-22 01:49:22 We don't ban tobacco, alcohol, n kids in cars.

NO NEW GUN LAWS
NO WEAPONS BANS
YES BAN BUMP STOCKS

YES more complete data bases for better background checks

Yes repeal the HIPAA laws to allow reporting of patient mental health issues that might make patients a threat
6605 2018-02-22 01:49:16 My Views have been derived from what the NRA teaches. And legislates for. Training, gun safety, liberal yet restrictive ownership via enhanced criminal background checks all of this has been proposed in legislation by the NRA they also said bump stocks should be banned
6606 2018-02-22 01:48:49 Blue Grass Kentucky...populist Trump just got lucky..murders bump stocks he made them wait so all this posturing ...a little       too late. @goodoldcatchy @DDrejer83 @NoGOPNo @WeAreUniqueCo
6607 2018-02-22 01:48:41 Universal Background checks. Ban bump stocks. 72 hour waiting period. Ban Military style weapons like AR15. If you care do something.
6608 2018-02-22 01:48:14 How many bump stocks r used
6609 2018-02-22 01:48:04 I agree, ban #AR15's & any machine gun type (also stocks that turn other kinds into them). But stop making violent TV shows, movies & video games? No. They aren't the problem, mental illness is. 99% of us know we aren't supposed to act out bad things from on screen. #GunControl
6610 2018-02-22 01:48:03 Wow. That's a bunch. I ran many scans in MarketSmith and found only a few stocks that I have any confidence in. Guess I need to look harder! And read your books again! I will live or die by the Minervini Method because it works!!!
6611 2018-02-22 01:47:53 Gold is “next” good investment, and always will be. Till then, common stocks.
6612 2018-02-22 01:47:35 Will GE move out of Dow Jones? It does not matter now as it's irrelevant. In an index of 30 stocks, its weightage is now less than 0.4%.
6613 2018-02-22 01:46:32 Could you please show where EXACTLY you wrote about bump stocks in 2014?
6614 2018-02-22 01:46:27 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, You and Congress can do this, stop the gun violence. Stop the ability to buy a weapon like the AR-15.  Stop the bump stocks.
STOP THE PAIN AMERICA FEELS EVERY DAY! You want America to be great again, fix the gun problem. Thank You.
6615 2018-02-22 01:46:01 Yeah I agree with Trump about getting rid of bump stocks, good call. Not sure about the mass shootings at the White House requiring the press Corps to be armed with anything other than the might of their pens.
6616 2018-02-22 01:45:55 Well making a weapon automatic is illegal. And bump stocks make the weapon highly inaccurate
6617 2018-02-22 01:45:42 It’s funny how @realDonaldTrump is actually trying to come up with ideas.That’s more than what any Republican POTUS has ever done. You ppl want expanded background checks. He has proposed that backed by the @NRA. Not good enough. He said let’s ban bump stocks. Yep not good enough
6618 2018-02-22 01:45:02 Canadian British and Aussie gun laws. No military weapons for civilians ever. 
Deep background checks. 
No bump stocks. 
No gun show loophole.
Tax the bejesus out of guns.
All legal guns kept in arsenals.  

You can see the pattern. We keep adding laws until problem ends.
6619 2018-02-22 01:44:59 Hope not bud.   Good to stay vigilant, but 3% 10yr still sucks as an investment and the real earnings stocks dont borrow anything !!!!
6620 2018-02-22 01:44:15 Get rid of all your meme stocks. I have reason to believe the meme subculture is dying. Don't ask how I know. I just know
6621 2018-02-22 01:44:10 They aren't similar to military weps because they aren't fully auto which the bump stocks should be banned bit do some research on them they are no different then a deer rifle
6622 2018-02-22 01:43:43 First, I hear you. Now go ban bump stocks.
6623 2018-02-22 01:43:32 Sometimes when I feel lonely I buy some stocks Its nice to have a bit of company #smile #reddit #jokes
6624 2018-02-22 01:43:24 Mr. POTUS, can u give an explanation why you can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”??-Thank you!
6625 2018-02-22 01:43:19 @BrianLukeKey2 Well, .@potus is now President gun control.  He is calling for the ban of bump stocks on news now.  Bump stock dis not kill anyone.  Out of control mentally sick male pulled the trigger.  But no, lets don't get tough on the killers.
6626 2018-02-22 01:42:46 Hence the potential ban of bump stocks. Hopefully that will “shut us up” and they don’t sell that many anyways. Nice try.
6627 2018-02-22 01:42:44 They could go up if investors believe that the stocks are a good value against their price.
6628 2018-02-22 01:42:35 I think it’s safe to say anyone capable of such a cowardly act is mentally unstable.  Let’s talk bump stocks...assault style rifles.
6629 2018-02-22 01:42:19 #EPF rates reduced from 8.65 to 8.55%! The govt body was allowed to take part in stocks to enhance returns. However the trend in last two FY have shown opposite trend. The govt should give them a Target of minimum 9%. At this rate #achedin will never come.
6630 2018-02-22 01:42:12 It worked out perfect too right as oil and gas dropped wow all hammers dropped on it
6631 2018-02-22 01:42:03 The problem with "vigorous" is HIPPA laws. 
I don't disagree with you at all, but the reality is that the ACLU fought to legalize bump stocks when even the NRA said it wasn't a good idea.. why? because of someone with a disability who "needed" it. HIPPA laws will crush change.
6632 2018-02-22 01:41:56 “Semi automatic” weapons covers to vast of number of guns to be thrown in a bill banning assault weapons. I do wonder why we allow bump stocks.
6633 2018-02-22 01:41:50 I am also against Assault weapons on our streets! If you are not the police or the military you do not need these weapons because you cannot hunt with them and a good old fashioned hand gun will do the trick! Bump stocks should also be illegal there is such a thing as overkill!
6634 2018-02-22 01:41:20 If Trump does ban bump stocks, it will be the first thing he’s done right in his entire “presidency”.
6635 2018-02-22 01:41:08 Mr. POTUS, can u give an explanation why you can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”? -Thank you!
6636 2018-02-22 01:40:48 So POTUS wants to arm 20% of nations' teachers.
That is an awful lot of teachers.
That is an awful lot of guns.
Is he secretly buying more gun stocks
to stoke a profit?
HMMMM
6637 2018-02-22 01:40:41 Never asked to take your guns away. I want:

universal background checks on firearms
two-day waiting periods 
a ban on all assault rifles
people convicted of domestic abuse to be prevented from ever purchasing guns
bump stocks banned
prohibition on transferring assault rifles
6638 2018-02-22 01:40:30 Bad news  and then earnings hummm
6639 2018-02-22 01:40:30 Here in Massachusetts you have to pass a FBI background check, mental illness screen and took me 6 months to get CCW. What else do you people expect to happen. Our AG already banned AR- 15 unconstitutionally and already banned bump stocks. You democrats dont follow the law.
6640 2018-02-22 01:40:05 As they should since the fake patriots would rather see more blood and brain matter spilled than give up bump stocks or anything that might minimize the carnage.
6641 2018-02-22 01:39:16 100% correct. He told the President the Australia change and results. The President instead gave him back the NRA talking points. A few days ago it was bump stocks and background checks, and today the President went backwards. No Democratic applause for that please.
6642 2018-02-22 01:39:16 Been grinding away around even for three straight days in Atlantic City as my stocks are about to fall.  Probably a good idea to switch back to stock mode.
6643 2018-02-22 01:39:03 "Listening" session was an insult as a means for a national leader yo address a national tragedy.. was disrespectful damage control theater ..even  saying "Bump Stocks make Semi-auto assault rifles " machine guns" PURE MALARKEY  bump sticks physically only increase trigger pulls
6644 2018-02-22 01:39:00 Really enjoying all the positive comments from the Left as the POTUS moves to ban bump stocks and starts a realistic dialogue involving students, parents, and educators.
6645 2018-02-22 01:38:59 Forget comparing gun licensing requirements to licensing and training for cars. Driver training and licensing in America is a joke anyway. But consider that car makers are required to make cars less deadly to be HIT BY! But we still allow bump stocks!
6646 2018-02-22 01:38:54 Ask the POTUS....can u give an explanation why you can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”?Thank you!
6647 2018-02-22 01:38:31 Mike, it's obvious Piers doesn't know guns much less bump stocks. He just jumps on whatever lib keywords he thinks make sense, thus showing his stupidity.
6648 2018-02-22 01:38:27 AR-15 is a semi automatic rifle. If a bump stock is added it can make it a machine gun. Trump is trying to pass legislation to ban bump stocks. What more can he do? Hand guns are used in killings far more than rifles yet you want to ban them? I don’t get it
6649 2018-02-22 01:38:08 Mr. VPOTUS, can u give an explanation why the POTUS can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”- Thank you!
6650 2018-02-22 01:37:19 Mr Pollack told you Exactly what you needed to hear, this poor man has to bury his daughter. I’ve done the same with my daughter Angel, bump stocks don’t mean shit. Get metal detectors in Every School armed guards, put current or ex military to stand guard. What’s a wall do when
6651 2018-02-22 01:36:56 Breaking : Indonesian gov't is to postpone the obligation of coal and CPO export using national vessels also known as cabotage rules which previously shd be implemented on May 1. Negative for shipping stocks
6652 2018-02-22 01:36:12 @realDonaldTrump I’m angry-we have 3 mass shootings in the last 4 months killing 101 people. YOU’RE still no closer to a ban on bump stocks. Stop suggesting guns as a solution to prevent killings-it’s what’s killing people. Have background checks in 50 states. NRA doesn’t lose.
6653 2018-02-22 01:36:09 Yes. True it does seem manipulated.
6654 2018-02-22 01:36:01 Gaps get filled 90% of the time?
6655 2018-02-22 01:35:18 Be brave. Stand up to the NRA. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Enough is enough
6656 2018-02-22 01:35:14 You can own a long term portfolio and a trading one too. Completely different stocks in each....
6657 2018-02-22 01:35:06 The ban on bump stocks is literally the only thing DT has done as President that has been worth a damn thing.

6660 2018-02-22 01:34:15 And he legalized bump stocks too!
6661 2018-02-22 01:33:58 Mr. POTUS, can u give an explanation why you can not sign an Executive Order to ban “Bump Stocks”- Thank you!
6662 2018-02-22 01:33:46 and for banning bump stocks, but an AK47 can do a lot more damage than an AR, it just doesnt have the same ‘military’ look.
6663 2018-02-22 01:33:29 Killed $dpz calls for another 15%gain today.  #stocks #pizza #mergers
6664 2018-02-22 01:33:07 Any reason Gold $GC_F isn't catching a bid while these #Stocks have been falling since FOMC Minutes...? I mean ST we have higher VIX, higher US Treasuries, higher Yen... I know $GC_F has options expiration & roll coming up tomorrow - but man Gold is being manipulated right now...
6665 2018-02-22 01:33:06 The deflection and BS the GOP is spewing currently is disgusting in this veterans opinion. The answer is not talking about mental health, banning bump stocks or arming teachers.
The simplest fix that will have an instant impact is banning all assault weapons. Ban them please.
6666 2018-02-22 01:33:04 I am a teacher and do not want to be armed.  I am a texas teacher which means my students have concealed carry.  Good times.  Why don't we just stop AR15s or bump stocks?
6667 2018-02-22 01:31:16 Good honest straight talk, Mayor Levine. Thank you. 
Owning a handgun or hunting gun is gteay (I have one) but we need to ban semi-autos & bump stocks. No reason for civilians to own military weapons. We dont allow civilians to own AK47s, grenade launchers or cannons. Same thing.
6668 2018-02-22 01:31:13 Gun nuts will sacrifice bump stocks to placate the calls for substantive reform. And that will unfortunately be the end of it.
6669 2018-02-22 01:31:07 This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard this ignorant behind president of ours talk about arming teachers why don't you get out the NRA pocket and do something about these guns with these bumps stocks this President is worthless and the Republican party to
6670 2018-02-22 01:30:40 Bump stocks don't even qualify as low hanging fruit. They're the fruit you find lying on the ground.
6671 2018-02-22 01:30:14 Don't give up. Most colleges and schools are against  this idea. The gun lobby supports this lunacy. They want to deter the sensible gun restrictions ( no assault weapons, BUMP stocks, background checks,etc). Vote them out and debate them.
6672 2018-02-22 01:29:43 Margaret Sanger called it her "Negro Project."  She saw birth control as "...the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks— those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization."
6673 2018-02-22 01:29:40 Does this explain why Joe sees a relationship between stocks and Trump's approval rating?
6674 2018-02-22 01:29:16 BUYING BACK THE STOCKS
6675 2018-02-22 01:29:01 You’re as big a sellout as he is.  You can fool the extremes on both sides of the ledger but those in the middle and local to the community know how you and the Cowboy were pals in the same saloon!
6676 2018-02-22 01:28:26 Uh, bump stocks? They allow a semi-automatic to mimic an automatic’s firing speed. And easily enough. They’re legal to purchase. The Las Vegas shooter used them.
6677 2018-02-22 01:27:31 @c6thomas hey bro do you also trade forex or stocks?
6678 2018-02-22 01:27:15 .Banning bump stocks won't really make us safer & the signal to noise ratio of bullet purchases feels unworkable, but the other 4, Hell Yeah
6679 2018-02-22 01:27:11 Where did I say, you didn't have the right to defend yourself exactly? Do you need an AR-15 to do that? That's using a sledge hammer to crack a nut. Well, even Trump's realising now. The bump stocks are going and we'll tighter controls hopefully, but you're probably against that.
6680 2018-02-22 01:27:11 Ban the Bump Stocks, raise the age limit and forbid mentally unstable to get weapons of mass destruction by color coding words or names on ID and Drivers Licenses where it is only noticable to certain people.  @realDonaldTrump
6681 2018-02-22 01:27:05 No more bump stocks. No suppressors. #BanAssaultWeapons
#BanNRA
6682 2018-02-22 01:27:04 I wish you all the best of luck on this $PDXP but based on experience Stocks suspended by the SEC almost never have a happy ending.
6683 2018-02-22 01:26:54 But not take away the guns we already have. Bump stocks should be illegal too.
6684 2018-02-22 01:26:43 Yes seems manipulated who doesn't want cheap tickets
6685 2018-02-22 01:26:15 Right, and maybe if high powered rifles with bump stocks and high capacity magazines were not so readily available the body count in Vegas would have been much lower.
6686 2018-02-22 01:26:08 #ThomasAnswers What are STOCKS? And why do they exist
6687 2018-02-22 01:26:05 Let’s imagine that the resource officers DID have a riffle with them on that day.Would it have prevented this from happening?You mean to tell me they didn’t shoot because they had no riffle(s)?What’s next?Bump stocks for them too?Think prevention not reactionary people
6688 2018-02-22 01:25:54 The Florida Congress intentionally used language that would ban a multitude of guns instead of military style weapons and bump stocks so they would have an excuse to keep taking NRA blood money.
6689 2018-02-22 01:25:02 If you can see the rationale for banning bump stocks and machine guns then logically you should also be able to see the rationale for banning just guns in general.
6690 2018-02-22 01:25:01 Australia banned assault weapons and there were no more mass shootings. GOP and NRA put $$$$$ over lives. Mental health checks, bumper stocks ban will do nothing. Ppl Will still buy automatic weapons capable of firing multiple rounds.
6691 2018-02-22 01:25:00 Donald Trump after talking to the NRA and getting their approval has taken a stand to maybe introduce legislation to limit bump stocks and make background checks more"efficient". woo hoo
6692 2018-02-22 01:24:56 It does if u prefer the people you voted for creating rules - we pay fortune to let Germany France & Italy sell us cars, give us subsidies NOT to grow food, raid our fishing stocks - there is whole issue of low skilled immigration - if your job was threatened it wld make sense
6693 2018-02-22 01:24:33 Totally agree. The 1st 2 steps are banning AR-15's and then Bump stocks! It has to be that way! These kids deserve better and should never ever have to live in fear! Screw the NRA!
6694 2018-02-22 01:24:31 AR15s are frequently used in mass killings. NO to semi-autos & modifiers, including bump stocks. Skeet shooters can go the old fashioned route. Grandfathered in? In Finland, you die, your gun goes back to the gov, not inheritable.
6695 2018-02-22 01:23:53 #Cult45 #ParklandStrong #BumpStocksWordGames  Even media at large and Dems seem Jedi mind f***ed by this "willingness" to offer gun regulations by banning "Bump Stocks".. The Vegas Shooter HAD to have a SEAR CONVERSION on his assault weapons in addition to bump stock modification
6696 2018-02-22 01:23:03 What a whipsaw in the US Markets last afternoon.Up 300 points to down 150. Fed meeting minutes triggered buying programs,bond yields went down and Dollar fell.Then the whipsaw.Stocks,Gold down,Yields and Dollar up.Same Minutes,interpretation changed. Price Action supreme,
6697 2018-02-22 01:22:48 The Republicans are working on the ban of bump stocks...you do know how a bump stick works right?
6698 2018-02-22 01:22:23 I hate to say this but I don’t see a good year for stocks. Commodities and cryptos will be the play in 2018
6699 2018-02-22 01:22:01 With bump stocks
6700 2018-02-22 01:22:01 And Obama did what? At least Trump just banned bump stocks. Obama stated they were lawful. Educate yourself.
6701 2018-02-22 01:21:51 This is just absolute F-ING madness. No banning assault rifles, bump stocks. Just more guns. And why the pretense that mass shooting happen only in schools? What about cinemas, night clubs, concerts? Those are ok?
6702 2018-02-22 01:21:35 Raising min age to buy an AR, banning bump stocks and strengthening background checks are the actions being “considered” by Trump.  These are the lowest hanging fruit. We need real change not just a couple scraps to make us feel better. #GunLawsNOW #GunContolNow #GunSense
6703 2018-02-22 01:21:04 I hear stocks in Charmin are up as well.

6705 2018-02-22 01:20:43 The RINO has already given in and is pushing for a ban on bump stocks and people under 21 from buying guns.

6707 2018-02-22 01:20:28 for instance, why didn't Obama ban bump-stocks?  las vegas massacre probably wouldn't have happened, but CNN and MSNBC don't say boo about that.  name one problem obama solved in 8yrs?  name one concrete thing he did for the black community in 8yrs.
6708 2018-02-22 01:20:19 #Caughtintheact   Now   trump   said   he  had  gun  stocks  so   how  are   they  on  the  victims'  side than  it  makes  no  sense  at  all.   People  need  to  stop  pertending   &  look  in  the  rare  view   mirror  on  trump  is  about.
6709 2018-02-22 01:19:36 there is a saying giving the devil his due. Trump is doing more on gun control than Obama Bush or Clinton. Banning insane bump stocks and stronger background checks.

6712 2018-02-22 01:17:29 Glad your worry of losing bump stocks or automatic weapons is more important than the chance of saving one life. Sweet priorities. Also you’re forgetting conservatives aren’t freaking because he doesn’t follow through on most promises.

6715 2018-02-22 01:16:44  there is no perfect solution. I know the market is flooded with these guns but 3 things would start the solution declare AR15 a weapon of war, ban bump stocks and improve background checks. I would say add mental health support but no doubt that will “cost too much” PLEASE

6717 2018-02-22 01:15:21 I wonder why Obama didn’t do anything about it. There were more mass shootings during his eight years than any other president and he allowed bump stocks. I never heard the outrage as loud as it is now. Strange....
6718 2018-02-22 01:15:20 No, just take some stocks back to 2014 levels
6719 2018-02-22 01:15:00 People are circumnavigating the law with the AR-15 style weapons outfitted with slide stocks. Anything designed to take a life like that is a fully automatic weapon to any reasonable person. They all need to be taken away just like Australia did.
6720 2018-02-22 01:14:49 @EBischoff Eric, I wish you would run for Office. Exceptional people (save for POTUS) run for Political office. When I hear undereducated Politicians & youth become experts overnight on Stocks, magazines, barrels, etc. Inject sanity into this chaos ....
6721 2018-02-22 01:14:44 Not remembering any gun control legislation passed by Obama except for approval of bump stocks. Certainly not remembering Obama having an open forum discussion on gun control with our citizens
6722 2018-02-22 01:14:40 @RepTenney 

If you’re going to blame politics, Las Vegas terrorist was a card carrying #REPUBLICAN. He killed and injured over 500 innocents tourists thanks to bump stocks & assault rifles.
6723 2018-02-22 01:14:35 Bump stocks are irrelevant if you're an experienced shooter, they are a mute point. You could design your own or build an actual semi-auto with a 3D printer. The issue isn't the validity of the law, it's relinquishing rights, rights only law abiding citizens will obey.
6724 2018-02-22 01:14:23 I don't believe Bump Stocks are Constitutionally protected.
6725 2018-02-22 01:14:03 BUMP STOCKS WERE DESIGNED FOR THE HANDICAPPED....THE LIBS ARE TRYING TO TAKE RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE HANDICAPPED... #TUCKER

That was two weeks ago!”

6729 2018-02-22 01:13:12 N i think sales license tomorrow gain of 100% lol or i think it will at least go up at least a cent 100%
6730 2018-02-22 01:13:02 Accepting Pre-orders. Limited stocks. Limited time offer. Pictures may vary in actual.
6731 2018-02-22 01:12:32 I support banning barrel shrouds. Also walnut stocks. And that pesky aiming reticule. #Tucker
6732 2018-02-22 01:12:15 No, you don't hear them, you don't give a shit. If you did why wouldn't you Ban assault weapons outright! Because of $$$, that's why. Background checks, and bumper stocks ban will still allow automatic weapons to be bought which fire multiple rounds.
6733 2018-02-22 01:12:12 I think it’s the GOP trying to save face and be “progressive”. Like “hey look! We’re taking action”. It’s all bs. Banning bump stocks was a nice start, but there’s a long way to go
6734 2018-02-22 01:11:30 N
6735 2018-02-22 01:11:22 You can achieve the same rate of fire without a bump stock, and better aim also. Bump stocks are a joke of an accessory.
6736 2018-02-22 01:11:20 And of course, the @POTUS is talking about mental health and bump stocks. Things that are SAFE with his $31,000,000.00 donors, the NRA!!! Will he do what’s SAFE? OR DO WHAT’S RIGHT??? I’ve supported you @JeffFlake but I have the same question for you? #MSDStrong #NeverAgain
6737 2018-02-22 01:11:13 Biss says three things must happen: budget to fund mental health, substance abuse treatment; invest in jobs; license guns, ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Also look at other states to stop flow of guns from across borders.
6738 2018-02-22 01:10:58 Sorry but a vague memo by Trump on bump-stocks is not a f*****g answer and it sure as hell is not a fix.
6739 2018-02-22 01:10:47 Maybe ban the mods for those weapons? With bump stocks, a semi-auto goes to auto (if I recall correctly). But, what is the real necessity of a semi-auto or auto to be in civilian hands, anyway? They are meant for mass casualty.
6740 2018-02-22 01:10:08 Countries that ban semi-automatic weapons, large capacity magazines and bump stocks rarely, and in some cases never, have mass shootings. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
6741 2018-02-22 01:09:36 It appears @realDonaldTrump is playing games with his ‘memo’ to cease selling bump stocks & requiring @jeffsessions to take action. @SenBlumenthal on Hardball stated @POTUS does not have the authority, this must be handled with legislation. @SenFeinstein tweet confirmed.

6743 2018-02-22 01:09:26 So, anyone for bump stocks is
also, sadly for people being mowed
down. There's no other rational.
And yet, the battle goes on, to get
them banned. I feel sorry, that the
US has really become disfunctional
and murderous of innocent people,
due to misunderstanding the 2nd
Amendment
6744 2018-02-22 01:09:23 Making automatic weapons legal again would remove the market for bump stocks.

6746 2018-02-22 01:09:16 @JBPritzker wants to "Ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks... Pass a gun shop licensing bill"  #TeamJB #twill #ilgov
6747 2018-02-22 01:09:02 Bump Stocks : got any REAL news to tease us with?
6748 2018-02-22 01:09:00 A friend of mine who loves his guns and shoots a lot told me this story about bump stocks.  He used his one time. He stated it was very unfulfilling and basically just a huge waste of ammo.  He said he will never use his bump stock again and it has nothing to do with gun violence
6749 2018-02-22 01:08:53 I mean your prayers there are answered already, i heard on the ol radio today that trump was pushing something through to outlaw bump fire stocks, so that won’t be an issue anymore. Honestly there’s no real use for them anyways so I’m not against banning the stocks either.
6750 2018-02-22 01:08:20 Put your money in etfs and buy stocks or options with your “chump” changes, when shit hits the fan, you’ll be happy you did

6754 2018-02-22 01:07:46 Pritzker calls for ban on assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity weapons. But says challenge goes beyond that, says Rauner has not funded services people need. Without them, they become desperate.
6755 2018-02-22 01:07:42 I'm not advocating for losing all of our gun rights, not in the least, id sign up for the militia to fight against that, but bump stocks are not the end all be all when it comes to gun control. It's not protected and effectively makes a semi auto mimic a full auto. Which is
6756 2018-02-22 01:07:37 Of course, this will appease the NRA.  When will we ban assault weapons that are capable of killing 10 people or more per minute?  An armed teacher won’t stop this!  Trump is “considering” legislation to “control” bump stocks.  Why aren’t these devices banned!  We want actions!
6757 2018-02-22 01:07:27 I honestly think it’s because people such as me before getting a little gun knowledge thought BUMP STOCKS MEANT SOMETHING IN THE FINANCIAL/BANKING WORLD. True, I did!
6758 2018-02-22 01:07:18 Yes and president trump is doing that. We will soon pretty much ban bump stocks and that’s a start. My hope is that we can fix these issues without being insanely radical. I feel utter sadness for those families. They didn’t deserve it.
6759 2018-02-22 01:07:02 It's good that you mentioned Jesus, because lordy knows Jesus would approve of teachers with guns. As long as those guns are assault rifles with bump stocks. He would want them to be fully prepared, of course.
6760 2018-02-22 01:06:37 Banning bump stocks is like putting a band-aid on a wound that needs stitches. #GunControl #Trump

6762 2018-02-22 01:06:26 What is this crap about bump stocks?! How many of the mass shootings in the US since Columbine used bump stocks??!! Why is that comment not being called out every time it is made!?
6763 2018-02-22 01:06:13 Ugh. No. We want all semi-automatic weapons banned, along with large capacity magazines and bump stocks.
6764 2018-02-22 01:06:02 I'm thinking I need to buy stocks in burn cream...
6765 2018-02-22 01:05:58 Banning bump stocks WILL NOT have any effect on lessening school shootings.
6766 2018-02-22 01:05:57 Why should it be the responsibility of non gun owners to outline specifics? Why can't we say ban bump stocks, and for gun experts to say, this is what it would specifically look like? Why can't they meet us halfway instead of shutting down because we're not using the right term?
6767 2018-02-22 01:05:45 Semantics is all that these gunhumpers have. Semantics is what got AR-15 weapons and bump stocks legalized. Don't get shined by these tools. Just mute and move on.
6768 2018-02-22 01:05:41 I need to figure out something tangible/workable to invest in to help build another stream of income or financial future. There is enough to make modest things happen, but I don't make enough to help it meaningfully grow towards anything in bonds/stocks. I think!
6769 2018-02-22 01:05:26 @KTENnews #Stocks had a wild day as the Dow had a 475 point range and ended down 160. #gold couldn’t keep its gains and ended down while #bitcoin had a hard day, down about $500
6770 2018-02-22 01:05:11 Before a teacher was allowed to carry a gun in school, they would have to go thru a background check. They would have to be trained. They would have to be stable. They wouldn’t be allowed to carry assault rifles or high-capacity magazines or guns outfitted with bump stocks.
6771 2018-02-22 01:05:08 ポンイチ上がってきたw
6772 2018-02-22 01:04:42 I go back and forth on this issue.  There seems to be some simple measure to start off with.  Unfortunately out politics are so fragmented that it’s almost impossible to get anywhere.  Trump recently banned bump stocks and people are still pissed.  It’s a start.
6773 2018-02-22 01:04:24 $BKL investors seeing some of the problems with a lack of vertical integration. A major risk with a lot of Chinese consumer themed stocks. Need to understand many of them are purely a marketing company with a brand and not much else. $BAL also felt the effects of this too
6774 2018-02-22 01:04:17 We need to put a bunch of stuff in the ban -- assault rifles, bump stocks, extended capacity magazines, firearm accelerators, trigger assist devices,  cop killer bullets.  No one needs these things outside of a war zone,,
6775 2018-02-22 01:03:01 @davidhogg111 Keep strong.  UR doing an amazing job speaking out. Dangerous semi-auto guns should be banned, not just bump stocks.  You'll never get the president or his cronies to go against the NRA. Fight to change the government in the midterm elections. The only way! (CANADA)
6776 2018-02-22 01:02:38 This was positive event. Glad Trump talking about school safety and reasonable gun control including ban on bump stocks, better background checks. Implementation of gun control measures used in Israel would help reduce school shootings.
6777 2018-02-22 01:02:37 Listened to the talk today.
1.21to buy any gun.
2.Ban bump stocks.
3.armed gaurds at school's.
4.restrict access to 1way in&out.
6778 2018-02-22 01:02:21 The sadder days are to follow unless @POTUS and Congress escape the clutches of the NRA & pass MEANINGFUL gun control. No AR-15s, no bump stocks, no large capacity magazines, deny firearms to the mentally ill, more data in NICS, eliminate the gun show loophole. Fix it or own it.

6780 2018-02-22 01:01:20 Psych evaluation, no gun until all checks/exams/training/registration/licenses/insurance is in place, renewal of eval/training/licenses/etc at reasonable intervals, raise the age to purchase, ban bump stocks and all mods that allow rapid firing, no large cap. magazine, limit ammo
6781 2018-02-22 01:01:09 We focus on assault weapons and bump stocks as the issue. Had this twisted young man walked in there with 2 9MM pistols and as many clips as he could carry would the results have been much different?
6782 2018-02-22 01:00:58 Probably. Then don't comply. Only 5 did in Massachusetts. We know there are at least 100 times more bump stocks and cranks here.
6783 2018-02-22 01:00:48 Here's a plan: no military style automatic weapons, no bump stocks, mandatory background checks, age restrictions, 48 hour waiting period. That's a start
6784 2018-02-22 01:00:23 You can't claim to be apart of the pro life movement while demanding unrestricted access to semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. That's not how any of this works.
6785 2018-02-22 01:00:17 Bump stocks? Nice try  Now be a real President and ban assault weapons.  They kill way more Americans than immigrants do.  #CommonSenseGunLaws #GunLawsNOW #WeCallBS #ParklandStudentsSpeak
6786 2018-02-22 00:59:52 Here's an example of why you need to understand guns. I was writing/videoing "BAN BUMP STOCKS!" in 2014. Pointed out you couldn't aim with them, only for massacring crowds. But the topic wasn't sexy. No one cared. More fulfilling to say "ban guns" when that would never happen....
6787 2018-02-22 00:59:40 The only way:

6788 2018-02-22 00:59:39 Too many stocks in one sector will spell disaster during the next bear market, say analyst.
6789 2018-02-22 00:59:13 There's some good stuff here and I can't see any possible reason no to try it? That being said: bump stocks, large capacity magazines / clips and silencers need to be made illegal. They are not for self-defense. AR-15 type weapons are not fitting into society, either, obviously.
6790 2018-02-22 00:57:38 Wrong. Maybe bump stocks and a tiny change in background checks. That's all
6791 2018-02-22 00:56:52 You think earnings will be good tomorrow? Hope so will see if price moves up.
6792 2018-02-22 00:56:41 So, I guess I don’t get it. If we outlaw assault weapons and bump stocks, are we solving the problem with school shootings. Is it okay for some nut to walk in a school with a six shooter and shoot 6 kids or stab 3 kids with a knife??
6793 2018-02-22 00:56:39 so they tried “thoughts and prayer”, then, “not the time”, then “let’s arm everyone in schools”, then “these kids aren’t real”, then “let’s get tough on the mentally ill (& immigrants)” then “no gun stocks”.. Everything but what is needed: #BanAssaultWeapons
6794 2018-02-22 00:56:27 With stocks mid-range, not a ton of big-time trendlines in play...but here's a potpourri of TL's for a late #TrendlineWednesday
6795 2018-02-22 00:56:23 The ban on bump stocks was small, but a good place to start. Let’s see if the big man is actually a big man.
6796 2018-02-22 00:56:05 Does it remember stock count or is it always start at 5 stocks?  4 stocks has been the rule of the land since GOML last year.  I usually end up wasting more time quitting the first match because it's 5 stock when it would have been faster to set it up the rules myself one handed.
6797 2018-02-22 00:56:02 I’ve always thought bump stocks were kind of stupid.  For most users it just wastes ammo and you can achieve a similar affect by putting your thumb through your belt loop.  I’d rather have three well placed shots than 30 random ones.  Bump stocks probably make you less deadly lol
6798 2018-02-22 00:55:51 How about ban assault rifles & bump stocks with age limit on hand guns? Hunting rifles OK at 10 ( with parent permission). I think we can work together on this.
6799 2018-02-22 00:55:45 Help stand up for the Second Amendment, call the White House at (202)-456-1111 today and tell @potus that he should oppose the expansion of federal background checks and oppose the ban on bump stocks.

If that number is busy, then call 202-456-1414.
6800 2018-02-22 00:55:25 Aside from the total ridiculousness of this "solution", it's just another way to sell more guns and enrich the NRA.  Ban assault weapons, increase the minimum age to buy ANY gun to 25, eliminate bump stocks, conduct better background checks, and use some goddamn common sense.
6801 2018-02-22 00:55:15 Do you think @realDonaldTrump should ban bump fire stocks?
6802 2018-02-22 00:55:01 So Trump's solution is to arm all teachers, have ex-Marines stationed at all schools, ban bump-stocks and raise the age at which a person can buy a gun?
Holy crap. This guy is nuts!

6804 2018-02-22 00:54:52 Thank you...I mean no disrespect but the majority of these shooters commit suicide, so I’m on the side of banning assault rifles and bump stocks, raising the age to 21 and God Bless every responsible gun owner. Hopefully they too can vote for these changes
6805 2018-02-22 00:54:45 Now there outlawing bump stocks TF 
6806 2018-02-22 00:54:16 No objections here. The perpetrators of these shootings obviously don't obey the law. These bump stocks can no doubt be manufactured by anyone. And once used in a shooting where someone is killed will be a mood point a murderer is a murderer regardless of the weapons available.
6807 2018-02-22 00:54:06 I think for sure we need stronger Bg checks and maybe at least a 2 week hold from purchase to get your gun. Bump stocks and motifications to turn semis into fully should also be banned imo. But besides idk what else you can do to prevent a situation like this.
6808 2018-02-22 00:53:51 Aside from the total ridiculousness of this "solution", it's just another way to sell more guns and enrich the NRA.  Ban assault weapons, increase the minimum age to buy ANY gun to 25, eliminate bump stocks, conduct better background checks, and use some goddamn common sense.
6809 2018-02-22 00:53:42 I’m looking at stocks right now, doing some performance research on medicinal marijuana and low and behold a pop up of Papa Johns came up.
6810 2018-02-22 00:53:33 Children aren't just killed by assault weapons, they are massacred by them. The same gun nuts who rationalize these massacres, certainly have no problems with increasing liberal gun laws. After all, it's important for them to have bump stocks & fire 100 rounds in 7 seconds.
6811 2018-02-22 00:53:17 Without guns our country would probably still be under British control. They are part of our heritage probably more so as Mainers than some others but even with that I do have to agree with banning bump stocks.
6812 2018-02-22 00:53:13 Also I think it's stupid as hell for people to hold longterm BIO stocks without knowing anything about reading the studies and interpreting them. Especially these penny stock bio turds that have no cash.
6813 2018-02-22 00:52:10 Why are they allowed to sell them to anybody? Why are bump stocks legal?
6814 2018-02-22 00:52:10 Stocks will be less attractive. It will be nice to have a money market that pays 4  or 5%
6815 2018-02-22 00:52:06 @realDonaldTrump why not sign an executive order that makes bump stocks and AR-15 illegal. I think your ratings would go through the roof.
6816 2018-02-22 00:52:02 Demand your mutual funds divest firearm company stocks.
6817 2018-02-22 00:51:22 So cryptocurrencies isn't just a new category of stocks on exchanges? Wtf
6818 2018-02-22 00:51:21 Why does an organization with only 5M members get to dictate what the majority of the US wants.. which is no bump stocks, no lg capacity magazines, 21 to buy long guns,and a better way to ck the mental health of a purchaser, etc.
6819 2018-02-22 00:51:08 Understandably a heartfelt position, but not smart move because over next 3-6 months, stocks will run with talk of bans.
6820 2018-02-22 00:51:02 So what are you going to do about it? Bump stocks? A tiny start. $50 says it disappears from discussion very soon, with nothing of substance done. It’s sick.
6821 2018-02-22 00:50:27 I'm still pissed at @realDonaldTrump for proposing a ban on bump stocks. Completely contradicting what he promised in the 2016 election, and if he goes forward with it, he's going to have a hard time keeping a lot of supporters.
6822 2018-02-22 00:50:03 people: do something about school shootings!

POTUS: sure, let’s criminalize students more, get more security theatre going, and flood the schools with guns

people: um...

6825 2018-02-22 00:49:05 99% of people can't hit the broad side of a barn in the best of conditions. It's ludicrous to think arming teachers is an answer for anything.

Stop selling guns to kids! Ban bump stocks. Demand thorough and lengthy background checks. Demand licensing and relicensing!
6826 2018-02-22 00:48:49 Civilians can own drones too. If folks are able manufacture bump stocks at home, what's keeping us from making gun mounts for drones? 3d printers/CNC = liberty
6827 2018-02-22 00:48:36 I am a gun owner. Raising the age to buy a semi automatic to 21 is fine. Bump stocks, why do you need an automatic weapon? If U wish to play with the big toys as an 18 yr old, join the service & U can play with all the big guns. Teenagers don't need autos. You can't hunt with it.

6832 2018-02-22 00:46:47 @NRA does NOT want a ban on the sale of 'bump stocks.'  Instead, they want more firearm sales and teachers serving as armed guards--instead of teaching.  @realDonaldTrump likes their ideas..., he seems to be ok with trading children's lives for the right to own a gun and kill...
6833 2018-02-22 00:46:45 Nope. I'm actually very supportive of putting the Russian and US 'legal stocks' into an autoclave and boil the motherfuckers to death, then throw in some cobalt-60 just for shits and giggles, and rinse it off with formaldehyde.

The first, last & only genocide I would approve of.
6834 2018-02-22 00:46:24 Mucho de la exportacion es a pérdida. Se utiliza para disminuir la presión sobre stocks. No es una señal de capacidad. Es una señal de crisis. Las dos , es decir este tipo de exportación y el crecimiento de bienes de consumo es producto de altas tasas de interés e impuestos
6835 2018-02-22 00:45:59 If the NRA had not opened the door to banning bump stocks we wouldn't be in this shit storm.
6836 2018-02-22 00:45:30 >Bump stocks lets semi autos act like fully auto's. 

lmao you turd, you can shoot it faster but apparently you don't know an M16 can shoot at a rate of 700-950 rounds per minute. I'd love to see you do that with an AR-15 and have the barrel not melt from the heat.
6837 2018-02-22 00:45:23 Stick to listening to him pick stocks.
6838 2018-02-22 00:45:12 It would appear the law would have to specify that AR-15s and bump stocks are "illegal".  
That's doable.
6839 2018-02-22 00:45:03 Make sure they’re not Russian trolls this time.
6840 2018-02-22 00:44:54 1) Just do normal, human things

5) Just be a normal human

Guy, thanks for speaking out. These twats who say you should stick to stocks should stick to watching you pick stocks.
6841 2018-02-22 00:44:39 Went cash in stocks. Stocks have that nasty feel. Horrible close. Brace yourself just in case. Btc breakdown if equities do.
6842 2018-02-22 00:44:38 Nice NRA response, how about no goddam assault rifles that only pussy cowards buy, or bump stocks that only mass murderers buy, stop being a sucker & parroting what millionaire NRA executives & politicians say?
6843 2018-02-22 00:44:25 Bump stocks are bad. He banned them. This is good.

6845 2018-02-22 00:43:48 Buyers will come from the upcoming great rotation out of stocks!
6846 2018-02-22 00:43:43 He is already banning bump stocks and pushing for mental health screenings . Man of action,
6847 2018-02-22 00:43:34 Yes Dinesh is the worst. Joe Walsh too. They pop up in my TL sometimes. They're the Skip Bayless for politics and real life issues. Valeshi is an expert in stocks, finance, statistics , economics etc. surprised to see him tweet something so wreckless. Not surprised anymore.
6848 2018-02-22 00:43:26 More jams occur because more shots are fired.  1,100 to be precise. And accuracy irrelevant bc he targeted a huge crowd. And Are you seriously claiming we shouldn’t ban bump stocks cause they suck?  That’s a stupid argument
6849 2018-02-22 00:43:06 Oh it's all so positive sounding! Hallelujah & god bless the United... Fuck it, Sorry kids, the NRA has spoken, there will be nothing useful done, the next shooting will go ahead on schedule. You might get Bump Stocks. Big, Fucking, Deal! Say goodbye to your kids in the morning..
6850 2018-02-22 00:43:03 Oh, well honestly. Don’t invest your life savings etc in stocks. It just doesn’t end well. Stocks might as well be a big scam. Like bitcoin is slowly going to be worth nothing.
6851 2018-02-22 00:42:47 What he said: "These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law."
6852 2018-02-22 00:42:24 These are some things that should also be considered to keep our children safe. Waiting periods, limit sales from private owners/gun shows, 10 round magazine limit, no bump stocks, no cranks, licenses for all arms, age limits, assault rifle ban and domestic violence ban.
6853 2018-02-22 00:42:08 Hell No! I can't believe that so many people are wanting a firearm with no rate of fire to be given an arbitrary rate of fire by the ATF! Once the ATF makes up their magic number they will say anything can increase rate of fire, magazines, competition triggers, stocks etc!

6862 2018-02-22 00:39:54 Asia AM Digest: FOMC Minutes Aftermath Hurt Stocks, Boosts USD
In the aftermath of the Fed’s minutes from the January meeting, Wall Street took a dive and the US Dollar gained. Meanwhile, the British Pound swung on a couple of key event...
6863 2018-02-22 00:39:52 Why isn’t the easiest fix the obvious option for conservatives? AR-15 which has been used almost all our mass shootings should be banned. Bump stocks that make a weapon almost fully automatic should be banned. Period.
6864 2018-02-22 00:39:39 Stocks are just gambling really. I get too addicted to gambling.
6865 2018-02-22 00:39:31 If your into stocks supposedly under armor is gonna be bought by Nike.. it's 15$ a share and may get as high as the mid 30's
6866 2018-02-22 00:39:11 Hearing liberals talk about guns/laws / bump stocks / assault weapons is like peeing on a electric fence. All talks on how to fix this problem should exclude all liberals they really do not have a clue.liberals would truly just make bad problems worse they are truly clueless.
6867 2018-02-22 00:38:54 This article is about bump stocks.... But to answer your question, there's no firm legal definition of "assault weapon". It varies on who you ask, and it's usually cosmetic differences like color (seriously) that might make something an "assault weapon".
6868 2018-02-22 00:38:47 He was lying,as usual.Has no intention of following up on bump stocks or anything sane related to gun safety
6869 2018-02-22 00:38:22 Pistols & Shotguns usually aren't
the issue, weapons of war & bump
stocks ARE THE ISSUE. AR-15s
have use which doesn't include
hunting, target shooting, skeet
shooting, etc. Instead they along
with AKs are designed with one
function in mind, mowing people
down, on a battlefield.
6870 2018-02-22 00:38:03 Typically incorrect democrat.  Retired  veterans to be hired as security.  It’s the sheriff in fla who offered gun training and teachers signed up in record number.  Raising age to purchase to 21.  Stronger background checks. Ban on bump stocks.  What did obama do? NOTHING
6871 2018-02-22 00:37:59 I can't believe that they are offering up the ban of bump stocks as a solution to the gun crisis.....its just an accessory.....the AR15 is still capable of firing a ton of bullets in a short amount of time without it!  This is like crumbs to the masses who they think are ignorant
6872 2018-02-22 00:37:16 As a teacher of history I fear the way future generations will look back on a society that considered arming teachers instead banning the AR-15 and bump stocks.
6873 2018-02-22 00:37:05 TRUMP ELIMINATE BUMP STOCKS BUT NOT ASSAULT WEAPONS ENOUGH BAN BOTH
6874 2018-02-22 00:36:25 I am a firm believer in the Second Amendment. I do think that we need to close the loophole for private Sellers and demand a real background check for everybody and a better system of keeping track of red flags. And we definitely should make bump stocks illegal.
6875 2018-02-22 00:36:12 I am a teacher. I do not want guns in school. Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Ban handguns. Improve background checks and make it harder to get a license to purchase a gun. #NeverAgain
6876 2018-02-22 00:36:02 We went from guns and rifles, to magazines to make relaxing faster,to clog magazines. Then there came the bump stocks.  Will grenades be next? We can't keep extending the limits.
6877 2018-02-22 00:35:59 So overall - Markets are trying to correct themselves. Do I think they will crash? No. Do the charts say they should crash? Yes. $BTC has already completed its correction, Stocks, Real-Estate and all other markets will follow. Such is the market cycle. Just pray we don't go bear.
6878 2018-02-22 00:35:56 He listerns, thinks & then realizes he dare not upset his puppet masters the NRA. So talks of only small changes which will have no if little effect. Most shooters had passed back ground checks, were legal gun holders & a been over 21. Bump stocks can be made with a 3D printer!
6879 2018-02-22 00:35:55 You've already had people give you suggestions. "background checks on ALL sales, waiting periods, national gun registry  database, mental health screenings, training and banning large capacity  magazines, bump stocks and “assault rifles". You then tried to derail the conversation
6880 2018-02-22 00:35:42 Bump stocks should not be outlawed. I learned how to bumpfire with a rubber band. Look on the net u will see. Now r the sicko liberal dictators going to ban rubber bands. No the dont care about dead kids, they only care about control of Americans FREEDOMS. Fight these evil liars.
6881 2018-02-22 00:35:03 That grill thing that doesn't stick is probably free because they can't sell these for some reason or because they need to empty their stocks 0-0 ( please stop using the oil spray on when you're grilling .... just use some touches of butter/oil on what you're grilling ;3 #GTLive
6882 2018-02-22 00:34:59 See now that is an actual solution, a change of government, get out and vote. Because we know how much the Dems did to change gun laws. Obama allowed bump stocks.  But back to your point. People need to get educated and vote.
6883 2018-02-22 00:34:52 It’ll end with an fissile out a month or two from now. Bump stocks, for whatever reason, will be banned and actual important reform, like holding the FBI and ATF accountable for not stopping this guy and preventing further in the future, will be lost for a false sense of security

6885 2018-02-22 00:34:45 There are a lot of issues...people, mental health, assault rifles, bump stocks, NRA buying out our congressman, and their cowardness to stand up for the people they are representing. Addressing just one issue will not solve the problem.
6886 2018-02-22 00:34:26 Uccchhhhhhh one step forward (bill to ban bump stocks). Two steps back... This.
6887 2018-02-22 00:34:10 I had some1 ask me today

Rob, why do u say Repubs win all the  when I see them lose? I said, tell me how. He said, well #Trump just banned bump stocks & I  he was all 4 the 2A? I simply told him he banned bump stocks not guns.

Winning is a matter of perspective my friend
6888 2018-02-22 00:34:05 He just banned bump stocks. He's planning on moving the age requirement to buy guns up. Just because he wants to kick out illegal immigrants who don't follow the rules or respect American values doesn't mean he is banning races. Minorities work in his administration as well.
6889 2018-02-22 00:33:59 After the concert bum stocks were threatened- NRA et al sold out- all of a sudden NRA had no issues with bumstocks because they had lined their pockets- they will support banning bumstocks because AR-15's did the damage
6890 2018-02-22 00:33:54 We are sellers at our place. Great company, but we think it’s had its time in the sun for this cycle. Airlines are stocks to be traded, not for buy-and-hold investors.
6891 2018-02-22 00:33:52 Actually, that’s not true. But hey good luck with NOT being in the stock market & understanding stocks on this great time! 
6892 2018-02-22 00:33:46 Bump stocks, but congress will most likely stop it. There are too many puppets on the payroll of the NRA that value personal gain over lives.
6893 2018-02-22 00:33:00 I have no problem with this decision, given that bump stocks and other gun modifiers are being used to convert rifles into quasi machine guns. We need to have a bright line between single shot rifles and machine guns.
6894 2018-02-22 00:32:42 Bump stocks were made  legal thru the ATF during the Obama Administration. Another regulation that seems to replace careful legislation.
6895 2018-02-22 00:32:04 This is a movement.  Please do not settle for anything less than a ban on all semi-automatic, assault --weapons of mass destruction!  NO ONE NEEDS AN AR-15! No one needs bump stocks.  We need a "red light" gun law.  We need required training & mental exams before gun license.
6896 2018-02-22 00:31:59 Make sure all your friend call your stockbrokers and get rid of all stocks u hold that are companies that make, sell, guns or gun parts or ammunition.  Get gun laws by refusing to invest!! Remember South Africa DIVESTITURE Works!
6897 2018-02-22 00:31:23 My problem with the gun debate is the lack of coherent arguments. Bump stocks are not the only way to change the firing rate, it's easy to do mechanically. Rifles are preferred by many shooters because of high cap mags, means more rounds into people. More reloading lowers deaths.
6898 2018-02-22 00:31:09 Thanks for a ban onbump stocks and for seeming to listen to the survivors of Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS. Reagan banned automatic weapons you can ban civilian access to assault weapons of war that are also not intended for hunting or Home protection @realDonaldTrump @GOP @DNC
6899 2018-02-22 00:30:44 Gotta say mate that the Post has been extremely strong lately. Some great reporters there doing great work and real depth in their reporting stocks.
6900 2018-02-22 00:30:17 The NRA/GOP strategy re: response 2 mass murder is now obvious.Placate with enhanced background checks, ban bump stocks, wait and then cite skewed statistics to show how the strategy has worked.And never do anything about semiautomatic weapons. Not enough! #GunContolNow
6901 2018-02-22 00:30:01 It was more that they eventually got to a point where bonds are a plausible alternative to overpriced stocks.
6902 2018-02-22 00:29:55 Why won’t any politicians say it — “gun control.” Not bump-stocks, not background checks, not everything BUT the one thing that will definitely make a difference — GUN CONTROL. I worked to get you elected. PLEASE do the right thing by our children. Our children are DYING.
6903 2018-02-22 00:29:52 Now we're in the part of the post-shooting narrative when elected officials start talking abt background checks & banning bump stocks.
Next comes the part where they get off phone with NRA & say, "So like I said - more guns will fix everything." #ParklandStudentsSpeak #NeverAgain
6904 2018-02-22 00:29:44 I am a retired Chicago Public Schools Principal. I would not want to arm my teachers. We don’t need more guns or more people armed. We need a ban on assault weapons, bump stocks and background checks. I support the students.
6905 2018-02-22 00:29:38 I know it's tough convincing investors that Canada has some great stocks we can invest in, given some of the stereotypes. More opportunity :)
6906 2018-02-22 00:29:36 Instead, restricting things which only benefit mass shooters (high cap mags, bump stocks) and aren’t owned by a majority of the gun owning population are a much easier starting point that would likely severely impact the rate of mass shootings.
6907 2018-02-22 00:29:13 @Mazin1027 can u help me w my neopet stocks?
6908 2018-02-22 00:29:11 I’m excited to have children and teach them about finances and buy them stocks! I just want them to prosper. Not many parents think to put their children in a situation to succeed as an adult. We need more of it!!
6909 2018-02-22 00:28:56 What are you talking about? He just authorized the justice department to ban bump stocks. And by the way, israel implemented this solution in schools and it works! Trump could do anything you would be unhappy!
6910 2018-02-22 00:28:45 Hopefully all of the mass shooters with their AR 15 assault rifles and bump stocks will move to Arizona!
6911 2018-02-22 00:28:33 Sir, by rate of fire I meant rounds per minute. Handguns have drastically slower rounds per minute than assault rifles. Parkland shooter made his gun fully auto through bump stocks, AR-15 not the fastest but it was certainly able to take 17 lives easily.
6912 2018-02-22 00:28:25 Considerations discussed. Carry and conceal for those who will be trained because it takes swat teams at least 8 minutes to get to the shooting. Increase the age from 18 to 21 to buy guns. Ban bump stocks and assault rifles AR-15 & background checks. Let's see what happens.
6913 2018-02-22 00:28:12 @realDonaldTrump Hell is coming your way in the form of angry, scorned teenager's, nothing short of what you deserve, banned bump stocks and background checks are not enough. #StonemanDouglas #StudentsStandUp
6914 2018-02-22 00:28:12 I’m done with “common sense”. We’re way behind common sense. There are still a lot of people who aren’t ok with banning bump stocks
6915 2018-02-22 00:27:50 @NRA is on the wrong side of History. I #standwiththekids and won't support any candidate that receives NRA .  Reasonable #GunReformNow age limit, background checks for all sales, ban bump stocks and Ar15 buy back program
6916 2018-02-22 00:27:41 What happens IF we OUTLAW "Bump stocks" or 60 count clips?? There are SO MANY already sold to the public!! WE NEED to STOP the sale of military type weapons and offer a "BUY BACK"! IT's WORKED in other countries!! I'm A GUN NUT--BUT I don't have weapons of mass destruction!!
6917 2018-02-22 00:27:34 what if i make a children’s toy that talks to you about stocks and hedge funds and call it the Forbesy
6918 2018-02-22 00:27:33 No one wants to outlaw guns, don't exaggerate. There is no need for a civilian to have bump stocks, semi/auto rifles. If you can't hunt with a normal hand gun/rifle you're not very good and shouldn't be shooting anyway.
6919 2018-02-22 00:27:31 Thanks for the excellent info; very helpful. #investing #stocks #StockMarket
6920 2018-02-22 00:27:15 6. Bump Stocks are a fun little gimmick that don’t make the gun any deadlier except in very specific circumstances with a lot of luck.
7. By public display do you mean open carry? How is that even an issue? Would cases make you feel better? Better hide the scary guns.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  gave orders to make ANYTHING that makes any gun a MACHINE GUN illegal ... mainly aimed at bump stocks, which does NOT make a semi automatic into a machine gun. 

As for those who already own bump stocks, I honestly don't know if he's going to want
6923 2018-02-22 00:26:28 Excellent and important question - no, there isn’t as far as I’m aware. HFs (not long only) generally own high beta  stocks FWIW.
6924 2018-02-22 00:26:20 Keep in mind this is coming from someone with a net worth of almost ten million dollars. I'm sure she doesn't invest in stocks and doesn't keep her wealth in the big banks she hates? She is a 1% er that she preaches about, but never announces she is a big one. True hypocrite!
6925 2018-02-22 00:25:55 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr President I'm just a guy from Texas.  You know banning bump stocks and what ever else will do nothing to solve the problem we have. It's feel good legislation and thats it. I'm asking sir please don't. The left will continue to ask for more and more.
6926 2018-02-22 00:25:24 Thanks for your input, John. Is this the PGA's position, the grain council's position or just your position? @WAPastoralists P.S. WAFarmers requested farmers got access to CBH delivery info (buyers already got it), which is now on LoadNet, not stocks.
6927 2018-02-22 00:25:05 My stocks were decimated in late Jan, early February.
6928 2018-02-22 00:25:01 The age limit needs to be 21 to purchase any gun,if kids can’t drink till their 21 then no gun till their 21!We need much stricter background checks &a longer waiting period(cooling off period) is needed!Do away with bump stocks.We as gun owners believe these are easy solutions!

6930 2018-02-22 00:24:21 @realDonaldTrump Hey donny, banning bump stocks, increasing background checks and arming a few teachers would NOT have stopped the #ParklandSchoolShooting & will NOT STOP kids buying & using guns. Civilians should NOT have access to military grade weapons. PERIOD #GunReformNow

6934 2018-02-22 00:23:44 Yeah. The @nra loves our plan on bump stocks. It will never happen without congress. My phony *memo* means nothing.
6935 2018-02-22 00:23:35 I think $FB might have rallied higher if no (or positive) FED minutes at 2PM.  I am finding it more difficult to analyze individual stocks technical data when it's influenced by broader market swings.  Do you factor that in or disregard?
6936 2018-02-22 00:22:15 .@raydalio: Probability of a U.S. recession before 2020 are "very low... We are not even in a bubble stage yet."

Buy Stocks!
6937 2018-02-22 00:22:08 Good picks but impatient sellers.
6938 2018-02-22 00:22:03 Watching Hardball w @SenBlumenthal addressed @realDonaldTrump signing a memo to stop sale of bump stocks. @POTUS does not have authority for this action. So @realDonaldTrump is lying again. This issue must go through normal chain of legislation.
6939 2018-02-22 00:21:47 @RepMcClintock As a father and American, I'm sure you are saddened and sickened by the deaths of the children of Parkland. Now is the time for you to help eliminate the sale of bump stocks.
6940 2018-02-22 00:21:42 I see that Amazon stocks it. But of course.
6941 2018-02-22 00:21:24 The teens are sincere. Just being used. Some gun controls are good (bump stocks, better background checks, better police follow up) but the real issue is mental health.
6942 2018-02-22 00:21:22 I’m so sick of talking and hearing talk about #GunViolence. IT’S TIME TO ACT!
1. Ban assault weapons
2. Ban bump stocks
3. Background checks for all gun sales
4. Instigate gun buyback programs country-wide

I’m native Texan and believer in the 2nd A. But ths violence MUST END NOW
6943 2018-02-22 00:21:20 Enact a law within the next 30 days to ban bump stocks and assault weapons now.  It has been 19 years since Columbine and congress has done nothing to protect and save our children from gun violence at school.  It could be your kid or grandkid next!
6944 2018-02-22 00:21:15 @NeverAgainMSD Trump was lying when he said he was banning bump stocks.  He knows he can't by regulation bc they aren't part of the law.  There is a bipartisan bill, and he won't sign it.  He also won't sign a bill for universal background checks.
6945 2018-02-22 00:21:13 Market weak. This news will be put in the back burner like other great NRs on pot stocks this past month
6946 2018-02-22 00:21:03 Thanks Dave always helpful to keep an eye on the stocks in drag!
6947 2018-02-22 00:20:58 Truth:
Trump asked is it was legal for him to ban bump stocks with an executive order.

Take it for what it's worth

6949 2018-02-22 00:20:21 And He even brought up legislation to make bump stocks illegal.  He could cure cancer a d trump haters would find a way to discredit him
6950 2018-02-22 00:20:20 Ban AR-15s, mega magazines, age limit for any gun to 21 plus training, no bump stocks
6951 2018-02-22 00:20:04 More lives will be saved by not selling assault weapons by banning bump stocks, requiring background checks for every purchase, minimum age 21 and a sensible waiting period.
6952 2018-02-22 00:20:00 Banning bump stocks is an insignificant solution to the gun violence problem in the US. Bump stocks aren't the problem;  they're just a way for men with big guns to let the world know they have tiny penises.
6953 2018-02-22 00:19:54 You don't know what stocks I may or may not own. Also went to school for business admin. So yes I do look at that stuff. Helps tell you how healthy a company is if you look at it. Here's the thing, don't like what Tito says? Don't read it. Easy.
6954 2018-02-22 00:19:53 Revisionism 101 nice try! He did nothing! All talk no action through multiple  shootings his administration had a chance to ban the bump stock #EpicFail the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions
6955 2018-02-22 00:19:50 I'd like to arm teachers and 
make schools harder to get into than Fort Knox.
Get rid of assault weapons,high volume magazines and bump stocks.
Make it harder to buy a gun. And start treating mental illness the way it should.
ALL OF THAT 
#GunControlNow
6956 2018-02-22 00:19:35 bad call I am afraid.   I say put  more and more money into vwmxx , the vanguard money market  1.48 percent and going higher or short term bond ladders.  Please stay away from bond funds, utilities, real estate reits,   stocks are still ok   ie,   growth, tech or discretionary  .
6957 2018-02-22 00:19:27 I think bump stocks might work on those old carousel slide projectors.
6958 2018-02-22 00:19:20 @HardballChris  Stop with the stupid talk. Bump Stocks should have been outlawed long ago. Today’s Listening Session was a photo-op.
6959 2018-02-22 00:19:19 Actually arming teachers would be last on my list of proposals behind mandatory background checks on ALL sales, waiting periods, national gun registry database, mental health screenings, training and banning large capacity magazines, bump stocks and “assault rifles”.
6960 2018-02-22 00:19:17 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer arming teachers with handguns against a weapon of war is not the answer. Allowing 18 yro to buy an assault rifle is crazy. Allowing bump stocks is crazy. if guns don’t kill, then I guess Nukes don’t kill.
6961 2018-02-22 00:18:52 -Ban bump stocks/trigger assist
-Kill conceal carry reciprocity bill already introduced 
-Make those who give/lend their legally acquired weapon to another person/family member an accessory to any crime they commit w/that gun
6962 2018-02-22 00:18:30 "Ban guns" will get nowhere. Here's what could:
1. Require biometric guns so only owners can shoot them
2. Universal background checks.
3. No sale till check completed.
4. Ban hi-cap mags.
5. Checks for all purchases of more than 100 bullets.
6. Ban bump stocks.....
6963 2018-02-22 00:17:57 Students and teachers would be safer in school when all assault weapons are banned.  Not just bump stocks.  No American citizen should have the right to own a weapon of war.
6964 2018-02-22 00:17:37 Yields and dollar moves are uncorrelating.   Central banks have pushed money in places it doesn't belong.  After the initial shocks, people will realize that bonds are better than stocks with demographic headwinds in play.  Yields are in 1s by 2019
6965 2018-02-22 00:17:27 The policy was valid due to the risk of HIV contaminating blood stocks. HIV can be undetectable for a while in your blood so that’s why they are so cautious
6966 2018-02-22 00:17:00 we should band bump stocks, 21 or military service with honorable discharge able to by AR 15 or like guns and hand guns, with full back ground checks, felons and any mental issues not allowed. School should have one way in and out with x-ray and metal detectors. Teachers carry
6967 2018-02-22 00:16:26 @realDonaldTrump doesn't hear shit... Bump stocks are far from enough
6968 2018-02-22 00:16:22 .@SenBlumenthal on #hardball "I don't take him seriously" on the prospect of the president banning bump stocks
6969 2018-02-22 00:15:51 What good? The lip service?
You think the NRA stooges are going to do anything? Those bump stocks the President said he supported banning after vegas massacre happened right?
6970 2018-02-22 00:15:45 It is amazing when market is down for one day, the number of Twitter posts with the content of advise, wise quotes goes up.....all become philosophers and write some common sense materials to show that they are wise traders....
6971 2018-02-22 00:14:34 I feel like: someone's going to get shot over the prices. Then Trump: "unbanning stocks in order to prevent people getting shot."
6972 2018-02-22 00:14:30 @iamrakeshbansal  
Sir good morning . Pls tell some good stocks for medium to long term.
6973 2018-02-22 00:14:29 Ban Bump Stocks for one important thing!
6974 2018-02-22 00:14:28 I'm a die hard Trump supporter and was proud if his meeting tiday with kids and parents. I've never owned a gun nor do I want to. I do think guns sales must have a 21 age limit, better background checks and no bump stocks. Plus school security.
6975 2018-02-22 00:13:54 And thats the hard part, i do prefer larger stocks because its hard for resell so people who actually wants to rock them can buy it
6976 2018-02-22 00:13:38 I feel like Trump has been taking baby steps in the right direction (finally) with the bump stocks thing and now these notes. They’re not bad, could be better, but not bad.
6977 2018-02-22 00:13:33 I am going to reply respectively with my thoughts; nothing personal.

You will not be able to ban semi-automatics. And from a self defense perspective I don't want you to.

You can ban bump stocks; who cares.  You can use a belt for same effect.
6978 2018-02-22 00:13:01 I have, in the past, seen pictures of personal in venezuelan military armories posing with non 103 AK variants, from the stocks we assumed bulgarian. There is an ongoing rumor that purchases have been made of non-russian AKs that were not provided to any units.
6979 2018-02-22 00:13:01 Yes but you are sadly clutching at straws if you think that Trump will in any way stab the NRA in the back after they helped him become President. He won't ban powerful weapons. Bump stocks can be made by 3D printers along with silencers. So he isn't going to do enough.
6980 2018-02-22 00:12:51 1. Inspections of guns? At the sale of the gun? To make sure there are no modifications? Regardless, 3D printing technology for deadly attachments already exist, and you can remove attachments put on (I personally believe bump stocks should be outlawed).
6981 2018-02-22 00:12:38 As a gun owner I can support the following changes in our gun laws 

Minimum age to buy a firearm 21 years old - to young to buy a beer to young to buy a gun
Close gun show background loop hole- there’s an app for that 
Ban bump stocks.
6982 2018-02-22 00:12:20 If Trump can ban bump stocks, the glaring question is why didn’t Obama during the eight years of his presidency? #DemocratsAreHipocrites
6983 2018-02-22 00:12:09 Raising the age to 21 to buy an assault weapon is a good start. But the Sutherland, Texas shooter was 26. The Las Vegas shooter was 64. More needs to be done. We're not done at raising the age limit and banning bump-stocks.
6984 2018-02-22 00:12:01 really? you are buying into the Psy-Op? Trump is looking to ban Bump Stocks, as a gun owner I feel indifferent about that, but as a Trump Supporter I feel Trump took a chip at the #2a
6985 2018-02-22 00:11:23 Had a great listening session with families of school shootings. Great talking, great listening. Tonight #ParklandStudentsSpeak on #CNN. More listening. We’ll talk vaguely, we’ll look to ban bump stocks but not assault rifles.Then we’ll REALLY listen to #NRA & do nothing
#Trump
6986 2018-02-22 00:11:07 Was anyone else a Geocities community leader way back when?  Actually got Yahoo stock for that years ago,  too bad I flipped for penny stocks that failed.
6987 2018-02-22 00:10:22 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
6988 2018-02-22 00:10:03 @POTUS YOU COULD DO SOMETHING HUGE HERE! BRING BACK THE BRADY BILL! BAN BUMP STOCKS! HEAR THE CHILDREN HEAR THE PARENTS. i LOST MY SON. I KNOW THAT PAIN. WHAT WILL IT TAKE?
6989 2018-02-22 00:09:57 @realDonaldTrump I can only imagine the pain. but tell me what is being done to protect the kids?  attacking 2A, banning bump stocks. raising ages does nothing to stop a killer who's had a coupla 13shot pistols for years
6990 2018-02-22 00:08:59 Not against background checks and don't care about bump stocks. But they don't do much if anything.  Many of these nutjobs will get guns legally even with a "strong" BG check. And then there are those that can be illegally obtained. These are our children and that's too risky.
6991 2018-02-22 00:08:57 Making our schools into armed fortresses to me is not the answer,  universal background checks and making gun ownership equally regulated across all 50 states makes more sense.  Eliminating bump stocks, assault rifles, waiting periods for purchases, long list of options 
6992 2018-02-22 00:08:32 @POTUS Seriously? This is your best idea? That now America has to arm our teachers??? Are you out of yr freaking mind? Ban the sale of assault & semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.  Oh right, you're the NRA's bitch. #UnfitForOffice
6993 2018-02-22 00:08:26 I think stocks still traded in fractions when that episode aired
6994 2018-02-22 00:08:11 @SenCortezMasto @RepJackyRosen @SenDeanHeller-Glad the President & some Republicans are coming around to banning bump stocks,that’s a start since it was used in the worst mass shooting.#VegasStrong 
AR-15 & semi automatic guns needs to be banned from civilian purchase. #GunReform
6995 2018-02-22 00:08:10 21 to buy..follow gun laws to buy a gun and ban bump stocks! You will have done more than any president has and so far you already have ! But this is important and than don't ever come against our rights to own a gun we will never give that up!
6996 2018-02-22 00:08:02 He's meeting with students. He asked Congress to look at bump stocks. What do you want him to do? He can't ban the 2nd amendment. You have to go thru Congress & majority of states have to agree. It's a long process. The killer Cruz killed those students. Not millions gun owners.
6997 2018-02-22 00:07:56 I agree with you.
Liberals should embrace (with caution) the ban if bump stocks.
Let's see if THAT even happens.
It's an answer to the Last Vegas shooting, it's late, but OK, we should take this.
Liberals should then keep up the fight after that.
But take that first step.
6998 2018-02-22 00:07:44 Tv debate "Lawmakers had the permission of NRA to legislate Bum stocks and they couldn't do it."

Seriously? Congress needs permission from NRA? 

#CommonSenseGunLaws
6999 2018-02-22 00:07:35 I was very impressed with everyone today.  No name calling.  And President Trump really listening.  I think we all agree bump stocks need to go.  BTW: I am a conceal carry.
7000 2018-02-22 00:06:52 Jeremy’s latest outlook for stocks is the worst that I have ever seen.
7001 2018-02-22 00:06:41 Who remembers Congressional Leadership's promises to 'address' the issue of bump-stocks following the Las Vegas shooting 5 months ago? In the time between Oct 1 & Feb 14, it all just faded away. 5 months is a long time. The only thing done since was the massacre of 17 more people
7002 2018-02-22 00:06:26 I am for giving him a chance, but if bump stocks is it....that is complete bullshit. And he better act quickly. This is not some new problem. We have know strategies for a long time. They want to dribble out the clock of the American attention span.
7003 2018-02-22 00:06:03 It's not about bump stocks. #realDonaldTrump, it's time to start keeping you promise. If you're really going to "make America great again," get real, meaningful gun legislation passed. #WorkingTogether4America
7004 2018-02-22 00:05:10 Ban bump stocks! Really! Assault weapons do NOT belong in the hands of anyone other than our military! Arm teachers! Trump, you are a Class A fool. Teachers are educators NOT armed guards!
7005 2018-02-22 00:04:38 Well that’s fine because bump stocks are lame as shit. Can’t even tell you how many full autos we have.
7006 2018-02-22 00:04:03 You’re right. Totally agree. They will just hope it goes away or will do something benign like ban bump stocks because the NRA is ok with it, and then say how great they are and look at everything they have done.
7007 2018-02-22 00:03:26 If your goal is to hit individual targets, a bump stock sucks.

If you're shooting into a crowd, bump stocks are great.

It's a prime example of circumventing the spirit of the automatic weapon ban while maintaining the technical legality of the gun.
7008 2018-02-22 00:03:13 There is a real difference between universal background checks, banning the purchase of guns by mentally ill people, and banning AR-15s and bump stocks - and taking away guns from responsible gun owners.
7009 2018-02-22 00:03:08 Any legit journalist on CNN who puts in the ether that trump cares about DACA or DEAD SCHOOL KIDS or banning bump stocks is as full of shit as trump&fox.trump cares about3things $,POWER&revenge.PERIOD

7010 2018-02-22 00:03:04 WAIT! what aboot bump-stocks?
7011 2018-02-22 00:02:32 I have to RESPECTFULLY disagree; smaller magazine sizes do not reduce the risk. This is the same argument that could be had for smaller beer cans, smaller vehicles, etc. As a 2nd amendment advocate I will agree that there is no place for firearm modifications such as bump stocks
7012 2018-02-22 00:01:40 @BretBaier Question:  
1. Aren’t “machine guns” outlawed for sale to the general public? 
2.  Aren’t “bump stocks” akin to turning a gun into a machine gun?
3. Why not attach “bump stocks” to machine gun law?
4. Too simple?
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine
7013 2018-02-22 00:01:10 Wait,  you are suggesting that banning bump stocks won't do the trick? Who knew?
7014 2018-02-22 00:01:06 ...but that said, we *have* seen the NRA budge, recently. When the Las Vegas shooter used bump stocks to increase rate of fire, the NRA (and GOP lawmakers, and even Trump) did and still are putting bump stock bans on the table, as far as I know.
7015 2018-02-22 00:00:56 Stocks
7016 2018-02-22 00:00:49 Q sigan sin trabajo no se consume sin consumo no se vende sin ventas suben stocks y bajan precios o quiebra se listo tu mejor arma no gastes
7017 2018-02-22 00:00:32 I assume you showed him the torch and pitchfork stocks ready to storm the palace of Westminster
7018 2018-02-22 00:00:24 In the stocks I hope?
7019 2018-02-22 00:00:22 You a-hole GOP cronies will do bump stocks with a grandfather clause so they can make them through the end of the year and maybe a waiting period. Solid nfw for anything meaningful.
7020 2018-02-22 00:00:19 AUD was Wednesday’s worst performing currency as RBA rate hike forecasts continue to be pared back. US stocks liked the FOMC inutes so USD gave back some of its gains #auszbiz
7021 2018-02-22 00:00:11 Your second amendment right doesn’t include the right to own bump stocks or purchase assault style weaponry at age 18. More, in depth, comprehensive background and mental health checks. Ban bump stocks and limit access to private seller loophole.
