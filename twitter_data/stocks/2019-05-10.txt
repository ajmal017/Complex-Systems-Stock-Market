0 2019-05-12 23:59:03 from people like Yergin, Smil, etc., is that peak oil is just wrong, esp. if the ability to convert across fossil fuel types is true--even assuming some absurd level of growth it would take very long for world to extinguish stocks esp. w shale/fracking.
1 2019-05-12 23:57:19 My aunt gifted all us kids stocks in the company she worked for and I just voted in the annual shareholder's meeting from my kitchen. I feel very fancy and oppressive.
2 2019-05-12 23:57:03 We should bring back the stocks for people who play audio out load full volume on the subway.
3 2019-05-12 23:56:35 Also, trump hasn’t passed a single bill that can be tied to the economic growth. The tax cut to the rich didn’t result in trickle down, they used the extra cash to buy back their stocks. Trump hasn’t accomplished a damn thing.
4 2019-05-12 23:56:32 He’s fucking us for profit. He’s loading tf up on stocks battered by the decisions and announcements he makes and then... he pretends he never said any of that and does the opposite.
5 2019-05-12 23:54:58 When are people going to learn. This is fake news and a Lie. As a risk taking shareholder Dorothy earned income (dividends) and paid around $10K in tax for her share in these stocks, as her income was low she received a tax return. Voters check facts re shares & franking credits
6 2019-05-12 23:54:33 Stated publicly he basically did a pump and dump on his stocks for over 20 yrs , has gone bankrupt how many times , lost over a Billion with a B dollars in the 90 s , is trying to tell us the media is evil because they are only reporting his activities , has torn us in 2, tell
7 2019-05-12 23:54:28 For example, I used to mention Daly & I = PAT all the time. Sometimes I mention it in passing, but it's wrong--it confusing stocks & flows! Georgescu-Roegen is fine but I didn't read him until later.
8 2019-05-12 23:54:21 Nobody who bought and HELD a TR fund in 2008 “lost their retirement.” Give me a break. It’s just stocks and bonds. It works fine and better than many portfolios put together by salesmen masquerading as advisors.

10 2019-05-12 23:49:24 Good move. Cannabis stocks are mostly overpriced, 3 years ago was the time to buy.
11 2019-05-12 23:49:06 Thinking of taking a small loss on a couple of other stocks so that I can lock in to $ZENA at this point
12 2019-05-12 23:47:28 You'll never get #Millennials to understand... All they want to do is spend money, smoke pot and complain about their #studentloans.. #Investing is out of the question. I'm one of the few millenials that wud rather buy #stocks and #bonds instead of pot & booze.
13 2019-05-12 23:47:12 I personally doubt it’ll have any significant effect. Preferred stocks with 10x voting rights for founders already allow tech companies to mostly do what they want even if they’re public. Don’t think less scrutiny is the way to go.
14 2019-05-12 23:45:28 Cosrx! Good morning cleanser! You can easily find them on hermo.  If you’re in kl, find play up store in starhill or timesquare they have ready stocks! It’s cheap and good!
15 2019-05-12 23:44:18 The Democrats could have got a lot done if they used Honey instead of calling him a traitor . Think about it. He signed the 1st step act, unemployment is low, the banned bump stocks, and he is looking a red flag laws. 

Instead ppl want to look at 30yr old taxes 
16 2019-05-12 23:43:35 honestly,, true. lemme just give them some of my stocks while i'm at ir
17 2019-05-10 23:58:40 Quoting myself from a conversation about what ails mainstream media:

“Basically editors should think like VCs but actually think like high-commission brokers selling individual public stock picks”

(stocks, startups —> bettable zeitgeist sentiments)
18 2019-05-10 23:58:31 As I posted a few weeks ago, I got some new money. I don't want to buy anymore stocks. So, I am going to sell naked puts as income strategy on stocks I don't mind to own at lower price if that happens but probably sell back. Will see how it goes. Plan to start like in June.
19 2019-05-10 23:57:27 Most penny stocks are a scam. 250k is a comfortable amount for the float imo. I'm hoping for a run above a penny next week
20 2019-05-10 23:57:14 So a team with Steph, Klay, and Draymond is so bad that the Rockets are laughing stocks if they get beat by them? Did you forget these 3 won without KD?
21 2019-05-10 23:56:40 Yep, even good results get punished in the mining stocks sometimes. Thanks for the words! I don't know enough about Twitter to know if everyone saw that. Consider a separate tweet for everyone's benefit, if not. Good weekend to ya, Luis!
22 2019-05-10 23:56:25 Um ok....hope  your well...no dm.huh?....k..   later...water thing got so bad havta crash at  motel bs..be good man!

25 2019-05-10 23:54:45 Imagine thinking we need to find a compromised "middle ground" between saving the planet and the financial interests of some billionaires who don't want their stocks to lose value.
26 2019-05-10 23:53:53 Here what about this ill hold the stocks and try to safe u?
27 2019-05-10 23:53:27 Sooner or later they will abide . I lived there for 3 years. Italy is very old-fashion / retrogade in mentality.
28 2019-05-10 23:52:55 Why u ask their opinion and when you get it you block?  Economy has been doing good, low unemployment, stocks still making me money and I’m still working.  How is it doing for you?
29 2019-05-10 23:52:23 I want to sell puts on stocks I only want to own at lower price! 
30 2019-05-10 23:52:21 Can you force @TicklishRoo Into those stocks?
31 2019-05-10 23:52:06 Bonds aren't negative and interest isnt zero and those are near-zero risk.  Stocks and real estate will always beat or at least keep up with inflation over time.
32 2019-05-10 23:51:20 I want to sell puts on stocks I only want to own at lower price!

34 2019-05-10 23:51:03 I need to start following more people who talk about stocks, or even just world/financial events.
35 2019-05-10 23:50:54 Regardless of the trade talk outcome,China had been asking for trouble since the relentless printing starting Jan.The bubbles were exaggerated when they allowed Goldman.S to write report to put the upside target freely for liquor stocks

39 2019-05-11 23:55:17 You know what else is hard to understand? Tariffs only hurt US consumers as prices go up. Do you know what is driving this economy? Consumer spending. Time to cash out stocks. Trump and apparently other Republicant halfwits have no understanding of trade and economics. #losers
40 2019-05-11 23:49:58 Ha!That is true about putting it in the stock market,but there is that chance you hit the big win. Then you can put it in the market. I play scratch off lotto tickets too, but since these weed stocks are about the price of a $10.00 scratch off trying to play some and invest alot.

42 2019-05-11 23:46:48 I use Tamiya Fine Surface Primer or Vallejo Surface Primer + Airbrush for priming.  For filling I use Vallejo Plastic Putty, Milliput, Tamiya etc.  Hobbyrama in Brisbane stocks all of these :)   For FDM prints I use a generic high fill auto primer from Supercheap.
43 2019-05-11 23:46:42 Hi Dr. @jimcramer, question for you: why don’t large cap stocks ever split any more?
44 2019-05-11 23:46:42 #49 Chris Cox sets quick time in the Super Stocks with a 19.488
45 2019-05-11 23:44:11 He is a financial genius and our stocks have gone way up from the moment he became our President.
46 2019-05-11 23:43:50 US stocks will trade higher starting Monday when markets open. We are AMERICA. China crying like a spoiled kid because they can’t keep making tons of money off US. People and companies will adapt and start manufacturing more in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Korea, etc. MAGA

49 2019-05-11 23:40:12 @InsidersABC re fc. Shareholders can sell some shares and buy up more divvy paying stocks to make up the loss of fc!
50 2019-05-11 23:39:23 It is important to know that the company you are planning to invest in is not trading stocks at valuations that are unwarranted even if the company is performing best in terms of revenue, management and business model

51 2019-05-11 23:39:19 Thanks you man!!! Next stop is the stocks
52 2019-05-11 23:37:10 Pedantic isn’t a suiting color on you. Even among those that know what a “full node” is, none want it on their phone. Also, fuck stocks, amirite??
53 2019-05-11 23:36:58 Again, Just wondering why someone would spend so much time bashing stocks that they aren't trading.  How does one make money with these tactics?Hmmm.
54 2019-05-11 23:35:36 20 Stocks de altísima calidad:)
55 2019-05-11 23:35:28 Why did the 6 year old that I’m baby sitting ask if I invest in stocks
