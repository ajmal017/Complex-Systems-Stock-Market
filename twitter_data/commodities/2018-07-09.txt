1 2018-07-09 23:50:26 If you need to go the ETF route, Apple and Nike are not the best stocks for your money. Start with commodities or less expensive stocks. If a person's money is funny, they don't have years to see dividends so these big names are not the best buy.
2 2018-07-09 23:47:41 To me, the high inflation rate is not necessary evil. It is an evil that could hit sharply our economy as it recklessly increased the prices of basic commodities in the market, thus, affecting the poor people. The Government, shall take proper steps to control it as I said
3 2018-07-09 23:45:12 Why aren’t big pharma companies and drug lobbyists not under fire for keeping birth control (male and female) prices artificially high? In a free market, prices of hot commodities go down with high quantity. Or is that too ECON?

You need a timeline that goes back about 40 years and move forward mapping the key political trends and most importantly the results of each political stage comparing various themes (wages, religion, commodities, law, racism, etc. ) Must be personal.
7 2018-07-09 22:49:53 One wave of regulation after another has created a very robust equity trading environment. Stocks did not crash in 2008. Now banks are gravitating to the business of their own volition. You even see bond, fx and commodities traders relying on equity markets via ETFs now.

39 2018-07-09 22:03:39 Thank you Senator for being diligent about the rights of women to make choices about their bodies. They are not commodities owned by the state or the Federal government!
40 2018-07-09 22:03:16 Honestly are you going to come up with a Zambian London metal exchange.?
The more pertinent question is why do they dictate the price of commodities? If you can answer the second question you've solved half the problem.
41 2018-07-09 22:02:29 Salary hike by liberals give rise to inflation in everyday commodities, why this inflation can be an indicator for hike. Usually in third world countries hike give rise to inflation, whats the approach here
42 2018-07-09 21:55:11 As the CasP framework points out, capitalism isn't so much a mode of production as a mode of power.

That is, a particular regime of keeping people subordinate to the powerful.

This has more to do with how assets are distributed than how commodities are produced.

44 2018-07-09 21:49:12 Paying someone else to tend your garden is like paying someone to watch a sunset, do a crossword or read a book for you. Turns the simple pleasures of being alive into nuisance commodities.
45 2018-07-09 21:46:16 How sensitive, loving and tender. So beautiful to see a donkey being looked after and treated with care and respect. Heartbreaking by comparison to think of the abuse and misuse donkeys and mules suffer throughout the world, treated too frequently as throwaway commodities
46 2018-07-09 21:18:22 A thought; since in Ly ppl get charged 50% more than cash prices when certified cheques or cards R used 2 buy commodities, isn't it only fare that gov should either:
-Increase pple wages by same %tage since they transfer wages in cheques
-Pay ppl wages in cash
-Sop this practice
47 2018-07-09 21:13:01 it will have to come through trade, from other commodities. Story mentions the cap as well. 
Numbers are Aither projections.
48 2018-07-09 21:12:56 You are ignoring the effects of financeability and the effect of inflation on bonds, domestic and foreign investment, trade, etc. This sort of economic tradecraft would divert funds away from USD and into commodities or other currencies.

52 2018-07-09 21:08:07 The ability to modify scarcity through consensus is what makes BTC dissimilar to gold and other natural commodities. Their scarcity is an absolute characteristic of the universe, not subject to human modification.

55 2018-07-09 21:00:28 3/5 La gasolina, como el crudo, tienen un precio determinado por los mercados. Así son todos los "commodities", como el cobre, acero, maíz, plata, etc. A esos precios les debes agregar los costos de traslado, manejo y almacenamiento para abastecer el mercado.

58 2018-07-09 20:29:10 If you want you could consider Dylan Cease as already having an impact on the ML roster. Prospects are commodities as much as they are future pieces for your roster and the Cubs cashed in on Cease already.
59 2018-07-09 20:18:48 And no one voted for a trade war with the USA, increasing volume of commodities subject to tariffs or GDPR. Shows that voting to stay in mis-sold as some form of status quo.

67 2018-07-09 19:32:34 What is done is some generic molecules are identified by a committee as essential commodities under life saving drugs & the prices are capped now the point that still remains is a company still has to stay profitable hence no brand name is used & branded drugs are sold separately

72 2018-07-09 18:42:29 Careful Chappy, to make sure you understand the instrument. Eg you can buy a Silver fund that has a higher value than the actual silver holdings.  I’m also not much a fan of commodities.  The only true bet is to buy pork futures when the McRib goes on sale 
73 2018-07-09 18:41:56 Os preços estão + baratos. Hj custa menos p/ cada Real de lucro. Tenho visto taxas internas de retorno maiores hj do q na época do impeachment. Commodities deram 100%, juros dividiu por 2, despesas financeiras despencaram, cias desalavancaram.

85 2018-07-09 17:20:30 A direct result of the physical nature of value computation in the middle of 19th century industrialization [with emphasis on labor] -  commodities having been mined with by the sweat and toil of weary men, has "measurable" value. An utterly useless metric in the 21st century.
86 2018-07-09 17:20:16 I could be wrong but I see Belt Road not only as a Chinese way of reaching Europe, expanding influence but also a way to spend all those surplus commodities (steel, etc) that have been piling up after the infrastructure boom. /3

88 2018-07-09 17:15:12 Fair point - but we already have zero tariffs on food/other commodities from 49 developing countries as part of the EU. Estimate of savings from lower food prices under WTO/hard Brexit is about 1%! Not worth it when seen against the potential impact on jobs here in other areas
89 2018-07-09 17:14:39 But it must, or else run the risk of being seen as a political arm of the US.  Same problem w/China using USD surpluses to secure future commodity supplies - US cannot say "USD surpluses cannot be used to secure commodities" w/o eroding USD rsv status...

97 2018-07-09 16:35:34 Coaches consider themselves commodities. Both Trotz and Korn are late in their careers. They have their Cup, now they want to get paid. The Islanders ponied up, the Caps didn't.
98 2018-07-09 16:33:53 I'm starting to think that Albion must be some Bermuda-based commodities broker. Because everyone else is fucked.
99 2018-07-09 16:33:17 Do you invest in commodities? If so which ones are you bullish on?
100 2018-07-09 16:23:27 I hope he made a bit more than that as a commodities trader.

102 2018-07-09 16:18:30 Sadly, so true. Take for example the private prison system. Every body in a cell is money for the private company. The GOP considers humans commodities. After birth they want you in debt ($ for banks), too much debt? Off to prison. Arrested while poor & can't afford bail. Prison.
103 2018-07-09 16:17:42 Cattle people can see a hole late year if high marketings continue, and placements stay low.

105 2018-07-09 15:57:40 No, APIs cannot be monetized by banks.

APIs are “just” another part of the plumbing. 

Unless you consider remote deposit capture, bill pay, SMS banking, or PFM to be “monetized”.

But do APIs help to create useful differentiation in a sea of commodities? Why yes, yes they do.

107 2018-07-09 15:54:20 Because the players are commodities. They have to take some part in marketing themselves. Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes had commercials and signature sneakers. That disappearing is all on misogyny? Especially when other women leagues are more popular than ever?
108 2018-07-09 15:54:15 I definitely agree with you there. The part I disagree with is signing him beyond this year. Prospects are unknown commodities, but that free agency money can go toward more pressing needs next year in my opinion.
109 2018-07-09 15:53:50 The Essential Commodities Act 10 of 1955 is an Act to provide, in the interests of the general public, for the control of the production, supply and distribution of, & trade & commerce in certain commodities for securing availability & equitable distribution of such commodities.

114 2018-07-09 15:46:13 Don't look away from this evil. It's happening even at the farms that produce your food. Because factory farms do not see these living creatures as those worthy of respect and care. They see them as commodities. As dollar signs. If you're against this, stop supporting them.

116 2018-07-09 15:42:51 Gonna guess the last time crude oil prices hit near 2 yrs. high with commodities esp. AG @ 2 yr lows was the 70's maybe?.  Wonder with rising cost w/much lower price on the farms, will famine spread beyound it's current borders?

119 2018-07-09 15:28:26 This is not what capitalism is.  Capitalism is an economic model that treats all of the factors of production as commodities and subjects them to the market.  There is no implication that the person who does the best job will succeed.
120 2018-07-09 15:28:12 You say that it is impossible to breed grasses in the north while the same north cultivated rice and other commodities which really require water. SMH.......
121 2018-07-09 15:21:35 This what we call humanity or humanitarin endeavors  is the biggest lie perpetrated  by the extremely wealthies greed of certain individual commodities, ex,our water (exceptable amounts of poison )our food G,M,Os,  BPA s ,our utilitu companys cutting services for profit
122 2018-07-09 15:09:26 Okay. So how has that reduce the cost of local commodities?
123 2018-07-09 15:08:59 This is why paradigms that conceive of utilization of healthcare as akin to other commodities fail.  A question as simple as: "How soon should I follow up doc?" invariably requires a big dose of supplier-induced demand ...

140 2018-07-09 13:32:11 Nunca vi ninguém admitindo isso fora a esquerda mesmo. O crescimento economico do Brasil nesse periodo foi impulsionado pelo crescimento da China e alta demanda de commodities. Enfim, é difícil explicar com poucos caracteres, mas a questão é da gestão dele foi o endividamento

210 2018-07-09 06:20:26 Seems to me that economic arguments for Brexit are:
(1) We may be able to procure some commodities on world markets cheaper than now because we can dispense with common external tariff; and
(2) We may make more advantageous trade deals with 3rd countries.
No evidence for either.

230 2018-07-09 05:02:50 Super duper imagination, write story and screen play for Bollywood movie. Past two years govt controlled essancial commodities price .
231 2018-07-09 05:00:02 Commodities: Cotton -3.59%, Rice -3.22%
232 2018-07-09 04:57:11 Where's this person been? Why do they believe that its just white guys!? lol. Watch some fudgin' youtube! There's all sorts over here, even ones they view as their precious exclusive diversity commodities. They just don't get hoisted and paraded around like trophies over here.
233 2018-07-09 04:54:53 .@INCIndia wisely kept diesel out of decontrol since it is the medium for public transport & goods traffic. Modi decontrolled it causing public transport fares & prices of essential commodities to rise. Will get below 250 in 2019. @nandaji1958 @Savitritvs @mahendra3 @jvidyasagar
234 2018-07-09 04:46:11 Dont forget that the foot volunteers and people campaign better than boards...door to door, remind ppl about cash shortages, prices, commodities shortsge, poor health care, and tht zanu cant fix economy while in power, so they need no more mandate. If not for furthr looting..
235 2018-07-09 04:26:41 The forward delivery model is too simple for crypto commodities. Nor is any founder going to offer a refund if the project fails.  @CatoInstitute
236 2018-07-09 04:25:12 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa
237 2018-07-09 04:22:26 Eu estudo economia. Posso dizer que o Brasil cresceu durante o governo Lula por causa do boom das commodities.
238 2018-07-09 04:06:34 I think you’re repeating my point - I think Xiaomi is selling commodities and Razer is selling a non-commodity. 

Perhaps we differ in our views of which is more durable (cost advantage vs brand)?
239 2018-07-09 04:05:37 You forget the origins of business—the exchange of commodities before money. You overlook not-for-profit enterprises and the function of governments (like your own) in the marketplace. 
My point is perhaps nuanced but fact. Money is a byproduct (npi) of the product of a business.
240 2018-07-09 03:58:21 Of course there are many failures. Thanks for pointing out. Mentioned some of those - 1. Lost money in the commodities cycle, big time. 2. Missed the current stock market rally. 3. Often, we learn to live with envy.
241 2018-07-09 03:52:22 i wonder if this week of the laggards - dji banks commodities yields, industrials
242 2018-07-09 03:42:58 War is the systematic murder of the poor who are treated like disposable commodities by the ruling elites.
243 2018-07-09 03:42:03 I feel that until we stop looking at people as commodities and/or investments to our own experiences, we won’t be able to move past “what’s in it for me” conversations.
244 2018-07-09 03:29:55 Trans border #smuggling is a top security issues for #Malaysia. Security officials say the most smuggled commodities from #Malaysia to Southern #Philippines is fuel and...every day food. Why? Bc Muslim-majority Mindanao wants halal food. #eastwestmedia
245 2018-07-09 03:27:55 Jeffery, you're ignorance, rudeness and lack of intelligence becomes you.
Your self-importance obviously overcomes you.
And, your kind or what you offer are not commodities worth wasting time over, like I've already done.
My bad.
246 2018-07-09 03:26:58 "Don't mention it, just rest for now. When you've recovered I'll bring you to wherever you need to go." he said as he gave her a reassuring grin, then headed back to his pilot's seat. "Use any of the ship's commodities to your heart's content!"
247 2018-07-09 03:23:49 Yes, but commodities are up all over the map thanks to the #TrumpBump
248 2018-07-09 03:22:00 Obama is responsible for gun running and fast & furious. Point being if you ban guns in the US just add them to the list of commodities smuggled from Mexico to the US for criminal use leaving law abiding citizens sitting ducks 
249 2018-07-09 03:18:50 the alembic in which a frightful quantity of goods and commodities has been distilled
250 2018-07-09 03:15:36 talked to our help at home and how her family is struggling daily because of the high prices of basic commodities, this is what your administration is doing.
251 2018-07-09 03:14:34 Ya quedó mal con la gente productiva, no da confianza y menos certeza hay que cuidar nuestro dinero antes de invertir o comprar commodities.

254 2018-07-09 02:44:32 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.
255 2018-07-09 02:40:55 This is no laughing matter. trump and the @GOP are dismantling America. Trade tariffs will only hurt the majority of Americans by increasing costs, job loss and lowering value of farm commodities. But the rich will get richer thanks to trump and the @GOP.
256 2018-07-09 02:39:03 Natatandaan nyo pa ba ang PANGAKO NI DUTERTE?

JUICE KO POH!  PARADISE NA PALA ETONG ANG TATAS NA NG MGA BASIC COMMODITIES NGAYON..IF WE DIED HUNGRY MAYBE IT IS PARADISE. LOL
257 2018-07-09 02:38:00 Senor! In that chao-run, people actually made margins off simply withdrawing or ex-chequering any "white" they held. Also,
-increase in available undervalued commodities
-correction of underinflation
-repo re-evalutaion(or rather, --non-need since mms era)
-wookening
-swiss favor
258 2018-07-09 02:14:54 An sold saw: “as copper  goes, so go commodities” comes to mind with Dr. Copper posting a sharp gain tonight. Expect further gains sooner than later!
259 2018-07-09 02:08:05 Sir , successful visit of Rajasthan , appre ciated by common man resultant of promises must reach upto  the grass root level of society ,prices of essential commodities especially kitchen items  must be within the reach of poor and middle class people of the society
260 2018-07-09 01:47:57 so we sould add a price cap on commodities. good suggestion
261 2018-07-09 01:45:10 To the @GOP humans are commodities. People in jail make private corporations money.
262 2018-07-09 01:43:21 Evelyn is a  commodities sales agent that likes Salsa golf on their spinach pizza with green tea
263 2018-07-09 01:28:29 'viewing animals as commodities' - I think you may misunderstand the motivations of farmers.
264 2018-07-09 01:23:18 Mas isso é mentira, L. A condição ter “melhorado” não foi por causa do Lula, mas sim por causa de Commodities.
265 2018-07-09 01:22:59 ruminants. The question isn't whether someone has an agenda, but whether their agenda is rational and ethically justified. Yes, I have an agenda - that is, to move away from viewing animals as commodities to be used, traded, bought, sold, consumed, disposed of and replaced, and
266 2018-07-09 01:19:45 “U.S. prices are already at a huge discount to Brazilian soybeans, sending the rest of the world to our doorstep,” Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at INTL FCStone in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a report.
267 2018-07-09 00:53:10 There is no wisdom without reflection. Deep thinking brings understanding and truth and yet we do it too seldom because it requires two commodities rare in our lives: silence and time alone. Precious space for our minds to be cleared of distractions.

270 2018-07-09 00:47:49 Thank you very f*cking much, Citizens United and the @GOP. 

Because apparently corporations are people, but people are only commodities.
271 2018-07-09 00:32:32 Is the latest capitalist advertising technique defetishisation of commodities.
272 2018-07-09 00:26:42 Aumentou devido as Commodities importadas para a China, em 2014 quando a China parou de importar produto bruto do Brasil atrelado a vários decisões erradas de sua presidenta o PIB caiu consideravelmente e ficou negativo nos anos seguintes. Lula simplesmente foi salvo pela China.
273 2018-07-09 00:23:07 a recent VP at the Dynamo who previously was at the Crew made a it pretty clear what is happening. Fans as commodities. It’s not going to stop. I think when fans and cities fight each other the owners win. The players, fans, cities are losing.
274 2018-07-09 00:22:53 Sure. Curbs on H1B visas, sanctions under CAATSA for weapons procurement, case in WTO against minimum support prices in agriculture, tariffs against Indian commodities, restrictions on oil from Iran, and lately, sermons on the need to relook relations with Iran and Russia...
275 2018-07-09 00:17:10 (1) Kids aren't commodities. (2) Families seek the best education they can. Some move entirely out of district. Probably more have moved than have ever chosen charters. So let's focus on the bigger picture here, no?
276 2018-07-09 00:08:55 Algo de verdad decís
Estabamos muy endeudados, casi el 67% del PBI, por suerte lo bajamos al 31%
También había mucha burocracia, casi todo los trámites eran personales y lentos, por suerte hoy, se hacen por internet y en el dia. También es verdad que exportabamos commodities,
277 2018-07-09 00:05:02 Awwww... I'm glad I can be here to show you how to convert your loved ones into sellable commodities.
