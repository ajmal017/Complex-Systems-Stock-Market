3 2018-08-06 23:57:48 We just went through the first period in my life time where branded drug companies did not raise prices for half the year. That is unprecedented. Drug wholesaler stocks have been hit by concern over what will happen to their earnings if not benefiting from price inflation.

45 2018-08-06 23:44:23 Re the public market in US cannabis stocks, a good rule to follow as an indicator that you could get slammed-Press releases without 8-Ks(bad), or 8-Ks on discounted offerings without press releases(far worse).  Several recent examples out there so make sure to check EDGAR.
46 2018-08-06 23:43:11 I just don’t think that you could call any group of random stocks ‘value’ on basis of their PE ratios, which could be no more significant in measuring value than the first letter of their names. Albuquerque! Snorkel!

49 2018-08-06 23:41:10 I don't care about Alex Jones - I care about the precedent set.  I also love the fact that these clowns running the 'new town square' have completely stepped in it. Watch those stocks continue to tumble.

52 2018-08-06 23:38:55 Unfortunately,  401k and healthcare do not cover average inflation prices of day-to-day goods and services. Either do stocks when years for vesting are required before one can access.

This CEO, in 2017, made 3,000x a day what his average warehouse employee makes in a year.

56 2018-08-06 23:30:02 Stocks: Global stock market risk index changed from positive to neutral. Our global stock market risk flagship closed at 40%.

FX: US Dollar risk index remains positive at 15%.

58 2018-08-06 23:27:11 It's straight from the Bannon /Trump playbook. Loving the bit in his article where fascist brown noser, Eton and Oxford educated Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson praises the Danes for sticking it to the elite. To the stocks with the braying oaf.

60 2018-08-06 23:24:10 I need more friends who are into stocks because I always talk about them and nobody gives af lol
61 2018-08-06 23:24:07 Ho-leee shit!  I would recommend Michael Ruppert's book "Crossing the Rubicon". He breaks down calls and puts and how there were a lot of people who were banking that American Airlines and other stocks were going to tank at that time.  A LOT. This shows some people knew before.
62 2018-08-06 23:23:33 There's almost no chance that we avoid all of this. Some feedbacks are already kicking in (less reflective sea ice) and some are inevitable (hot temps will enhance oxidation of carbon stocks). BUT acting now keeps those feedbacks to a minimum. There is no single cliff edge.
63 2018-08-06 23:23:26 So, today marks one year of the passing Grandma Stocks. She is Survived by a beautiful family, that I’m honored to be a part of. You should be so proud of them all, such beautiful people. 
Elizabeth: I will never break the promise i made you. Love Me . Miss you 
64 2018-08-06 23:22:03 But see thats where your wrong. Apple, Facebook & Youtube whos owned by Google are NOT private companies.  They are all 3 publicly traded stocks, they were no longer private companies the moment their stocks became public.  So for them to say their private companies is a JOKE
65 2018-08-06 23:20:14 Oh no one is crying, guy-but I’m looking forward to seeing these companies throttled politically/legally for playing both sides of the road - they want to act like utilities and then cut off political voices of specific color? Lol! Stocks are already tanked. Keep it up Leftists!
66 2018-08-06 23:19:23 More or less immature than Tweeting about Trump's balls?

BTW love how you recommended GDS, Crisper, and weed stocks right before they collapsed.

69 2018-08-06 23:16:25 Agree with you. Stocks are overoverbought, especially hightech sector. Smart-money moving out of EM. In August markets will loose 500bln$ of liquidity (UST). It is beginning of long downtrend.

74 2018-08-06 23:13:42 Twitter blocks my account every day and every day I email them and they open it. What is @Twitter's problem? They have endless resources to block and open accounts all day long! No wonder their stocks dropped! Bunch of Losers 
75 2018-08-06 23:12:36 Most of Bezos’ net worth is not based on the “valuation” of anything, it’s mostly based on the actual market price of the publicly traded Stocks(which are very liquid).  If liquidity is your point?  Liquidity didn’t seem to be a problem for Gates.

83 2018-08-06 23:10:19 JAG, did you even read the very article you cited?  Take a good look at the very first paragraph—stocks went up with the announcement that the Clinton e-mail investigation exonerated her.

And Trump didn't go into office until January 20.  Apples to apples, remember?
84 2018-08-06 23:09:16 Your character is admirable.  No car, no fancy phone, no homeownership expenses, and possibly, hopefully, a truckload of Berkshire stock.  Your expenses must be 30,000 a year.  Good for you.  My cousin is the same way (investment vehicle is homes, not stocks).

94 2018-08-06 23:02:35 Twitter & Facebook are publicly traded companies. Time for a buyout of both stocks.
95 2018-08-06 23:00:20 Aren’t there regulations that are watching and preventing these kind of P&D (in stocks I mean)?
96 2018-08-06 22:59:28 Number of leading stocks today: 57 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
97 2018-08-06 22:58:41 aren't most social media platforms, technically speaking private? their companies have stocks/shares/whatever. So in a way they are not private.
98 2018-08-06 22:58:16 Loading some Quality #MJOTCS heavily right now.  I know I said cash is king but I’m going for it. Most of these stocks putting in higher lows this year.  2018 moves should be much bigger with way more catalysts heading into November elections.

101 2018-08-06 22:52:50 I'm curious if you and @shaneshifflett know how to trade traditional markets or the crypto markets when you guys were doing research on this pump and dump stuff? By "knowing how to trade"... I mean do you guys know how to make money "consistently" trading stocks or crypto?
102 2018-08-06 22:51:54 I definitely feel like an adult now that I get excited over stocks...
103 2018-08-06 22:51:22 مفهوم، قصدت كملاذ تنصح بالذهب او الدولار
104 2018-08-06 22:51:19 أما شراء الذهب كسبائك فنعم
بالامكان شراءه من السوق مباشرة بدون وسيط 
وبكن ايضا يفضل تداوله عن طريق وسيط وبرافعة مالية لمضاعفة الربح المحتمل

مع الاخذ في الاعتبار انه بالامكان خسارة جزء او كل رأس المال في حال حدثت تقلبات حادة للسعر مخالفة للتوقعات
وهذا وارد
105 2018-08-06 22:51:18 Thats really helpful. I've only attempted stocks at this point. I've been wanting to try bone broths. I feel like homemade ones have so much more flavor
106 2018-08-06 22:49:46 I’ve been comparing the valuation of alts with the that of stocks lately.  In doing so, I can’t help but think these speculative ventures whose token gets you nothing other then right to use it are extremely overvalued compared to a legitimate company where you get ownership..
107 2018-08-06 22:49:37 Sm ct ka nagbakal? try mo sa sm delgado. Mas damo didto stocks hahaha
108 2018-08-06 22:49:15 حسبتك تقصد التداول عن طريق المنصات بالرافعات المالية
شراء الدولار من السوق بطريقة مباشرة غير مجدي
عملتنا مرتبطة بالدولار والفروقات تكاد تكون لا تذكر
الدولار يتم تداوله في مقابل العملات الأخرى
كاليورو والباوند والين والكندي الخ
109 2018-08-06 22:47:39 Love it... but I’m guessing the good guy didn’t need bump-stocks or anything else to modify his gun that should be illegal to stop the criminal.
110 2018-08-06 22:46:48 I've been keeping watch on Moviepass analytics and it bumped up to 13c for a moment.

Stocks are cheap rn, how do I invest? if it crashes I'm out a few hundred, if it succeeds I can make a little something
111 2018-08-06 22:46:38 The way stocks fail.    The market, group, or stocks  goes down.
112 2018-08-06 22:45:22 These are the 2 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$ROL, $NRIM
113 2018-08-06 22:44:04 My Acorn is doing well. I only had it for about 2 months at this point and I been slowly adding my debit card change, and a few regular deposits. Since I started I halted my regular stocks and the money is just sitting in portfolio.
114 2018-08-06 22:42:39 Stocks were great today. Not a bad idea to diversify. 
115 2018-08-06 22:42:20 but its bad to time to get into stocks since there near all time highs
116 2018-08-06 22:40:47 ذهب من سوق الذهب اقصد ودولار من عند الصرافين - اونلاين ما لي مصلحة جربت وتعبت
117 2018-08-06 22:40:16 How did you start in forex? Aren't stocks more profitable?
118 2018-08-06 22:39:27 It is subjective however you don’t find too many tech stocks as “value stock” in a traditional sense.  Microsoft definitely was a value stock a few years back after being mismanaged by Ballmer.
119 2018-08-06 22:38:23 I'd be happy with some combination of banning bump stocks/high capacity magazines/AR-15-style weapons, close gun show loophole, comprehensive background checks, longer waiting periods, no guns to those with domestic violence record, strict licensing, education, trigger locks.
120 2018-08-06 22:38:09 Agree. Mcgi will be a 50 bagger imho from these levels
121 2018-08-06 22:37:55 Smooth. That’s the only one my merchant stocks. (I vellum!)

123 2018-08-06 22:37:28 Well S&P didn’t go up as much when China stocks went from 2000 to 5000. 
What matters is perhaps real economic slowdown
124 2018-08-06 22:36:23 @DuranMoney stocks buy back is inefficient use of capital. #sharebuyback is stealing from small shareholders and transferring capital to large ones. #superweathyonlywin
125 2018-08-06 22:35:22  Found these #stocks that set record highs: $AAPL, $SPSC, $LDOS, $AER, $PLUS, $JKHY

128 2018-08-06 22:33:31 See economist MEMORYMAN pick stocks
129 2018-08-06 22:32:36 Yeah, that's why stocks and views plummit lately...
130 2018-08-06 22:30:22 2 technology stocks soared strong  on Monday:
$EFII 13.6%, $WEB 11.1%
131 2018-08-06 22:29:38 What facebook and the likes are doing will cost them dearly in the near future.

If one has stocks in these platforms, PULL, PULL.
132 2018-08-06 22:28:28 China Stocks plunge? It was up 143 points.
133 2018-08-06 22:27:49 Please show me a 1,000 stocks that are undervalued in this market.

We can’t just keep repeating things for them to make sense.
134 2018-08-06 22:26:23 Pls @nprpolitics @CNNPolitics @thehill @jaketapper @Lawrence @MMFlint @MichaelAvenatti Can we all follow the $12B Farm bailout $? I have a sneaking suspicion that just like Corp.’s used Tax Windfall to re-buy stocks, this $ will go to BigAg shareholders 1st, not Family Farmers
135 2018-08-06 22:26:17 Way to go! I bet you understand them more now that you’ve tried them. Always check option volume before you enter one. Some stocks don’t have good flow and you can easily get stuck in it.
136 2018-08-06 22:25:17 These low-quality canadian "pot stocks" are like a gift that keeps giving. 

Half of them will never post a positive cashflow and their multiples are a direct funnel to a long/short funds bonus pool

148 2018-08-06 22:12:31 You can see 5ma is coming toward to cross 10ma then 10ma will move up. You can keep this chart in your desktop and wait for few days you will notice 5ma will cross 10ma. Mark the date as August 6, 2018. That's why I love bottom stocks to move nice up trending.
149 2018-08-06 22:12:02 That is not what a public company is. Stocks are bought and sold on either NASDAQ or the Dow...  Why do you think they call it an IPO (Initial Public Offering)? If that company angers too many shareholders, the company will tank.

160 2018-08-06 22:05:46 #Facebook back on the rise again, glad I never sold my shares #stocks
161 2018-08-06 22:05:13 @____ka0s_____ @jonate123 crypto doesn’t move like stocks. Scalping is harder imo
162 2018-08-06 22:03:37 There is no neg to fall. All industy indicators and news are great. Similar sector stocks are hitting new highs often. The underlying commodity is trending up strongly. UEC has assets as good as any stock in its sector.  Insiders buying.  So, I see squeeze or pos pressure.  You?
163 2018-08-06 22:03:29 However, if you took $100k to a wealthy persons house, they’d be like “oh thats cute! One of the stocks in my throw away Robinhood portfolio decided to pay me my  dividend via carrier pigeon this quarter”.
164 2018-08-06 22:03:02 Thanks mate a few shit trades this year too but actually recently emptied my bottom drawer and shit stocks to refocus on companies going places

182 2018-08-06 21:57:09 You are right how ever in many companies they give us a vote actions such as this their shareholders should have a vote But i believe their stocks are going to start dropping because of these actions. As well as such actions as this will hurt their bottom line people will leave.

193 2018-08-06 21:53:39 فالعقوبات الإقتصادية على سبيل المثال يسبقها خلاف سياسي فيصبح الإقتصاد أول ضحايا الخلاف السياسي
كما أن هناك أمور أخرى تؤثر على سعر صرف العملة ومنها التدخلات المصطنعة
او التلاعبات في اسعار الصرف
كما تفعل الصين في عملتها وكذلك اليابان
اللتان تساهمان بشكل مباشر في اضعاف العملة

196 2018-08-06 21:52:54 @HDederle Hi Hans, I have a question on your day option trading. what are the techniques to get your options order filled when stocks are volatile. I found it hard to them filled to maximize profits on positions and end up loosing on the trade. Your response is appreciated.
197 2018-08-06 21:51:49 Smart move
198 2018-08-06 21:51:20 عملة الدولة مرتبطة بإقتصادها وبياناتها المالية ومنها الأجور والبطالة والوظائف والناتج المحلي وثقة المستهلك والإنتاج الصناعي والقوة الشرائية ونسب التضخم
ونسبة الفائدة الخ
كما تتأثر أيضاً بوضع الدولة السياسي
وعادة ما يكون الأمر مختلطاً
199 2018-08-06 21:50:57 I understand that but surely the kit had been sorted pre Bielsa so I can’t see the issue. Plus they never had stocks of the popular sizes last year especially the black kit.

205 2018-08-06 21:47:55 Was just screamed at because we didn’t have a product in and apparently we don’t do our oubof stocks properly. Best part is that the guy claims he is a manager at another store. Even going as far as pulling out his time card and flashin that he is a “manager”.
206 2018-08-06 21:45:55 مفهوم اخوي، كيف يتم التأثر على سعر الصرف بهذه الطريقة؟
207 2018-08-06 21:45:45 تراجع سعر صرف العملة يتبعه تضخم
وارتفاع في العوائد على السندات والتي هي في الأساس عبارة عن أموال تقترضها الحكومات من مشترين لسنداتها مع كوبونات بعوائد "أرباح" بنسب متفق عليها وأطر زمنية متفق عليها كذلك
والدول تصاب بالعجز عن السداد حين تسجل نسب العوائد أرقام عالية كحال تركيا اليوم
208 2018-08-06 21:45:24 Awesome trades!
What was your play & position size on these stocks?
209 2018-08-06 21:45:16 U.S. Economy is growing at over 4% a year.... hmmmm classic lie. but I will take it b/c i trade stocks and that only helps the stock market.... anyone that "helps" the country really only helps the stock markets which only helps traders and rich wall street people

212 2018-08-06 21:42:44 الحقيقة أن الليرة التركية بدأت في مسلسل التراجعات منذ عشر سنوات تقريباً
ولكن حدتها زادت عبر الأيام القليلة الماضية
بسبب الخلاف التركي الأمريكي حالياً
وفرض عقوبات أمريكية التي يراها المراقبون كطلقة تحذيرية ستتبعها طلقات مباشرة إذا استمرت تركيا في خيار التصادم مع الأميركان

239 2018-08-06 21:26:14 Oh, and I guess FaceBook's and Twitter's stocks going down are "fake news", eh?
240 2018-08-06 21:26:09 No, banning these pages is the OPPOSITE of free speech. Your blatant bias against Conservatives is disgusting. I hope your stocks continue to tank & the US gov puts their boot on your neck. Time to stop the Orwellian behavior.

362 2018-08-06 20:20:37 Today @TDAmeritrade featured $PGNX as one of the stocks that hit it's 52 week high on Friday. Essentially it puts a bullseye on these stocks for the day traders/shorters. PGNX especially does much better out of the limelight.

371 2018-08-06 20:13:47 World stocks ex US edge lower: US +.4%; Europe -.1%; Earnings won the battle against trade tension today in US not so much elsewhere. Investors underestimate the effect of a trade war on US corporate profits. May not occur but it is a real risk. Short-term caution advised
372 2018-08-06 20:13:42 I assume that's only when proven.. And when things are proven, they won't be offered on AIM... It seems the success chances are ultra low but rewards are portrayed as "high"... Anyone who "invests" in those stocks is simply a gambler!

375 2018-08-06 20:11:15 Perhaps getting a load of congressmen/women may help, especially Sen. Paul, and if he's elected, Austin Petersen, and possibly Rep. Amash. Hopefully, they should codify it into law that bump stocks are legal, but the dems, especially the more progressive ones will oppose it.

403 2018-08-06 20:00:25 Nah, not jail. Lock them up in public stocks with dildos stuck to their foreheads. Let them be mocked and ridiculed for a week. Cheaper than prison, and people can feed them scraps as they pass, so no cost there either!
404 2018-08-06 20:00:19 stocks go up and down all the time, brokers call it profit taking.

409 2018-08-06 19:56:39 Oh my @twitter @Facebook @YouTube @google You just awoke a sleeping giant called The Federal Government and @SCOTUS .  Tsk tsk tsk. I can't WAIT to watch this play out.  If you like money, I would sell my stocks in any of these companies before the Fed starts asking questions.
410 2018-08-06 19:56:38 Too bad, but he will NOT stop. Nunes is on a mission 2 help Trump escape prosecution any way he can.

438 2018-08-06 19:45:29 I believe that we need to ban bump stocks, limit the amount of ammo that you can buy at one time, have more thorough background checks, make people wait after paying for a gun before getting it, and make people get a license that proves they know gun safety that must be renewed
439 2018-08-06 19:45:26 And yet, today in Yemen and Gaza kids are being killed with armaments supplied by the United States, all of which is highly profitable for people with stocks in those areas.

443 2018-08-06 19:44:06 Why would it be held up prolonged period? If one does not invest thr capital it will decrease through inflation. No one keeps money under their pillow. They invest in bond, stocks, venture capital to avoid the decay. Would be foolish to do otherwise

456 2018-08-06 19:41:36 So, yes, if they had gone all in on stocks, they would be ok right now. But plans have underperformed even 60/40. And 60/40 would have still left them in a big hole. Now, this calculation understates the problems because it ignores the mix issue.

466 2018-08-06 19:39:11 No set formula,  I want to see how the rest of the market behaves, how aggressive a certain stock is being bid, how my other stocks are behaving.

468 2018-08-06 19:33:47 Le plus drôle chez les gens comme toi, c'est que vous vous proclamez défendeur de toute forme de liberté, héros social à deux balles, mais tout ce que vous demandez c'est la censure de l'humour qui ne vous plait pas.

Continuez, gueux, nous on a des stocks de popcorn. 
469 2018-08-06 19:31:53 earnings reports are often catalysts for momentum stocks and the fact that the market shrugged off stellar earnings is alarming.  Also, what are you talking about $75 before seeing $65 again.  this thing topped out at $46 and change
470 2018-08-06 19:29:37 No, the average working person hasn't felt any benefit from this "booming" economy so they're tuning that bs out. Corporations buying back stocks does not put extra food on the table of most families. But it puts a lot of extra steaks on the plates of CEOs.
471 2018-08-06 19:29:37 I can't believe they are posting stories about pump n dump groups now! They have been around since I started in crypto. What difference is it to stocks and shares or tipsters lol

473 2018-08-06 19:27:34 if every resist person did, it would have a major impact. Hard to bribe Congress when you're losing profits. Stocks tank when sales are under expected for a quarter. We could hurt them in just 4 months with a focused effort

they've taken away our power in democracy, but not this
474 2018-08-06 19:26:23 In the absence of any economic data or glaring geopolitical headlines, Stocks and Bond prices are near unchanged in what looks to be a slow
475 2018-08-06 19:26:13 How is Apple only at $200 with a trillion dollar market cap? I think this is a good time to buy apple stocks. Long term hold.
476 2018-08-06 19:26:11 Nice sentiment.  Can't believe how similar the stocks have performed.
477 2018-08-06 19:25:46 Does total return mean it includes dividends? How much capital gains would be owed on  the stocks that rotated out of s&p? Does that change the return profile enough in an taxable account.
478 2018-08-06 19:25:43 Yum, cannot wait! Although I have just replenished my stocks of the original 3 flavours.
479 2018-08-06 19:25:33 B, You're 100% correct. I (unfortunately) live in one of those communities.  Getting local politicians of that demographic to talk sense about gun violence (even BUMP STOCKS! heaven forbid) is an exercise in futility. #BlueWave
480 2018-08-06 19:23:00 Good. There's a lot of cacophony n gazillion news on stocks n stock market. It's kinda difficult to filter noise from real substance all the time.
481 2018-08-06 19:22:48 This interaction with your portfolio is exactly why I am a follower. Finding the stocks to buy is the easy part. Watching you managing risk and your portfolio is where it's at.
482 2018-08-06 19:22:28 Just found out bump fire stocks are legal in Md.... getting one asap
483 2018-08-06 19:22:16 Mmm Looks lovely, no wonder your stocks going fast.
484 2018-08-06 19:22:05 This is absolutely true. But it implies that people have more financial firepower than they do. My answer to when to buy stocks is “whenever you can.” For most people, dollar cost averaging over an extended period of time is a valid strategy because it makes investing a habit.
485 2018-08-06 19:21:40 Probably could of got 5s if you were on bid. People been giving away money today on so many stocks

489 2018-08-06 19:20:17 They aren't private & their stocks are worthless. They are kept afloat so they can spy on us. The CIA funds them with our tax dollars through their investment firm, In-Q-Tel.
490 2018-08-06 19:20:15 He was paid for being an attorney/expert witness and isn't constantly making money from one industry like Smith. If elected, he'll stop all work with his clients. Tina has millions of dollars in conflicted stocks that become more valuable when we pay more for healthcare.

492 2018-08-06 19:19:28 Also, I am generally focussed on a very few companies ..... I rarely sell, and even if I sell I may buy back those same again when I think they have hit the bottom. 
Else it is difficult to continue to pay attention to all the news about all the stocks out there.

496 2018-08-06 19:17:04 Clerico, how do you choose your stocks? Do you assess the stocks fundamentally?
497 2018-08-06 19:16:42 This is obviously the narrative we can expect in a bear trend. 
And this is what we could hear in 2008 with stocks as well.
It's always the same.

500 2018-08-06 19:15:08 Imagine an era where house prices (asset stocks) were based on true affordability and that a public sector employee could afford to save sufficiently to buy a home. That human aspiration has been eroded by property portfolio MP’s empire ambitions.
501 2018-08-06 19:15:03 hoje em dia não se justifica a capacidade oficinal que havia em 2010. Quanto ao resto, remeto novamente para a lógica contínua da manutenção. Sempre houve stocks, sempre houve cadência de revisões capaz de assegurar oferta. Até em 2016
502 2018-08-06 19:14:25 So, I'm thinking of getting into stocks cause I hear you have a 50-50 chance with those. Gotta be better than that lotto investment strategy I've been using. I've only won ten out of hundreds of entries. Who can survive on 981 million?
503 2018-08-06 19:13:56 Y'all always calling stocks out at the highs so new people buy ur shares when u dump.  Then u bank and get out safe.  U should help people buy when u are actually buying at the low, stop loss trigger.
504 2018-08-06 19:11:48 You’re welcome.  Also been looking at this sector to hopefully give cues on if rates could be topping, bc housing stocks hate when interest rates are moving higher, since most consumers just pay attention to monthly payments (reflects incremental projected lower demand).

656 2018-08-06 17:50:27 I can verify your statement as fact.  

I'm seeing it with my own eyes. 

I think the Chinese are just holding their cash in hard US assets.  

They know the paper value of US stocks isn't really real.
657 2018-08-06 17:50:21 I can say that it has zero forecasting ability. Overpriced stocks can stay that way for a long time. Nflx pulled back when they missed badly on subscribers this quarter. Yet they’ve been fighting to keep the price high on the stock.

6) Has consistently posted profits.

All that money could be used in the real world to raise wages or invest in real things for the benifit of everone not just the lucky few.

765 2018-08-06 16:51:18 Reasons to get into trading stocks ,
You make your own hours . 
The profit is ridiculous . 
High possibility to becoming a millionaire within your first 3-5 years . 
You are your own boss. 
You learn discipline and consistency. 
You can literally make money from anywhere .
766 2018-08-06 16:50:55 I absolutely agree. It's almost like they are selling at a loss to short cover for someone. It's the only thing that makes sense to me. Why would you sell stocks at the bottom especially the ones with the largest upside?

786 2018-08-06 16:42:02 A lot of craziness going on about  @infowars getting banned on Facebook. Im not worried about it. Judging by Facebook stocks, it's not far away from joining Myspace. So, they will be irrelevant soon anyways.

788 2018-08-06 16:40:39 Traded 10 different stocks today (probably too many). was down 1,5% after half an hour but then let JUST two winner trades do their job and I closed the day up 0.13%. Power of #LetYourWinnersRun!!! #Consistency
789 2018-08-06 16:40:24 Musk has generated a lot of unearned confidence (IMO) by being bombastic and an 'adventurous capitalist', and I think that's keeping Tesla stocks afloat even amidst disasters that would sink other automakers.

And as long as stocks remain relatively steady... well I dunno.

793 2018-08-06 16:39:08 Sorry but how are you not mad at G having a stock system like Juri but he keeps his stocks unless he's knocked down? They didn't change Juri system because "it would be too strong" and then they release a character with the same a similar system but that rewards good play.
794 2018-08-06 16:38:17 And your point that there is a publicly traded supply problem is SPOT ON. There is a reason the private equity market is booming. Not only are listed stocks down, their share counts are down...brought to you by QE.
795 2018-08-06 16:37:42 Well market cycles are long with 6070s rough, 80s90s overall great and bad 00s. So blow off top bulls shouldn't occur often. I'm realistic and realize can be wrong.
My portfolio is invested very long term, long stocks. I'm your age so have invested thru some bad stuff

810 2018-08-06 16:33:22 If Brexit is dashed and Labour gets in it means McDonnells plans to set their own rate to take back stocks wont be allowed because we'll be in the EU.

Which means their policy costs/borrowing costs are going to skyrocket for all the nationalisation they want.
811 2018-08-06 16:32:51 Forego paying bills to buy stocks? What are you suggesting? The stock market is not a measure of how well the economy is doing. Nor is it an indicator of rising wages, nominal or real.
812 2018-08-06 16:32:35 Not much to gain from watching stocks at present. S&P unchanged
813 2018-08-06 16:32:32 That’s at least arguable for very small companies, but not for large liquid stocks like Apple.

815 2018-08-06 16:32:31 Taxes are never "given away" they are simply not confiscated by the Government in the first place. 

Also, it's booming for anyone with a pension, 401k, IRA, or stocks of any kind.  You know their called SHARES for a reason and that reason is you share in the gains.

846 2018-08-06 16:18:09 We’ve seen an increase in the # of co's outside the US that have shown up on our screens as undergoing meaningful change.

883 2018-08-06 16:03:36 Well, given the added rejection of the supposedly better ‘fundamentals’ - fiscal-monetary ease, official press talking up stocks, #PBOC move on fwd FX - I’d say that was clear enough to be worth a punt.
884 2018-08-06 16:02:46 Bro Yachty spend $140,000 on a chain, I'm not even joking. Do you know how much Amazon stock you can buy with that?? Stocks go up in value, whereas chains & jewelry sink in value. They are just money pits. Jewelry should be a no go!

963 2018-08-06 15:27:25 Thinking about this all wrong. Chinese stock market is already crashing yet they don't seem phased by it because their national finances don't rely on stocks. By contrast, US has not crashed "yet" and such a #crash would hit US finances hard. I know what my money is betting on

966 2018-08-06 15:26:31 After GDR rush, confidence made a lot of ppl think that if stocks trades 10-20% below GDR price, it was cheap + hence a buy. This happened in stocks like Arvind. The stocks later fell to between 5-15% of GDR price. Promoters bought from markets after investors were cleaned out.
967 2018-08-06 15:26:17 And now I’m smart again.

1039 2018-08-06 14:56:30 Back in February President Trump promised to ban 'bump stocks' - devices that turn weapons into 'virtual machine guns'. How can he continually accuse Democrats as being weak on crime” when he’s done nothing to address this pressing issue. This isn’t a 2nd Amendment issue!
1040 2018-08-06 14:55:54 amzn rsi is at 58 (below 70).

1043 2018-08-06 14:54:52 Hi Martin, I recommend opening an ETrade account.  That is where I trade my stocks.  If you haven't traded before i would definitely start small and learn before putting too much money at stake!
1044 2018-08-06 14:54:45 Stocks in focus: Can BYD make the 'Turn-Around'? A few month after the hype BYD is still falling. Its already on the same prise as the stock was before booming. Time comes when BYD gets in focus again. But remember: Never catch a falling knife #stocks #economy

1053 2018-08-06 14:51:58 Interesting, several housing stocks are headed into 52 week low pricing
1054 2018-08-06 14:50:32 Perhaps similar to other market anomalies, like min vol... people might think buybacks are 100% bad, so shun the stocks that do them, favoring stocks that are more capital intensive (think Tesla or Netflix)

1063 2018-08-06 14:45:58 When the 10yr hits 3% or higher stocks will get rattled. Use this knowledge to capitalize and short your favorite globalist scum AAPL, AMZN, FB. But it won't last as they will quickly to suppress bonds, and use that as well to profit from your favorite golabist stocks.

1075 2018-08-06 14:41:28 @SEC_News Many people are unhappy about the money many CEO's make and other financial issues. Given that statement, let me make a recommendation. The #sec should make a rule that says a company can either issue stock options or buyback stocks NOT BOTH ! Accountability !

Eric Zitzewitz, former chief economist at the IMF, November 2016:
If Trump wins we should expect a big markdown in expected future earnings for a wide range of stocks — and a likely crash in the broader market (if Trump becomes president)."

It’s how they continue to make the #stock weak, so they can continue to drive the stock price down with fake dumps.

1085 2018-08-06 14:37:34 Oui... les derniers stocks sont à saisir
1086 2018-08-06 14:36:58 Interesting article, but I'm not sure I agree completely. The article omits that over 4,000 of these companies were micro cap stocks from the tech bubble. And more importantly, stocks outside the US has grown from 20,000 to 40,000 since 1997.
1087 2018-08-06 14:36:54 Wall street has had it's finger on the scales against 2A stocks. We the people need a 2nd Amendment ETF to protect the Industry that we use to protect ourselves. #MAGA

1096 2018-08-06 14:32:16 Some isn't a majority though. The majority cashed in on the property boon, then the credit boon, and now they're trying to get richer while they're retired (stocks).

They're the product of the great depression saver mentality and ignorant the cost of easy money, like Greece.

1101 2018-08-06 14:30:07 What is a 'Swap'
A swap is a derivative contract through which two parties exchange financial instruments. These instruments can be almost anything, but most swaps involve cash flows based on a notional principal amount that both parties agree to. #Money #OptionsTrading #Stocks

1103 2018-08-06 14:30:04 $ACAD the Piper downgrade once again highlights the fact that there are so many biotech "analysts" that know squat about their company coverage as well as valuation metrics. Most have never put any $$ in a stock and watched it decline as stocks like $ACAD have. What a joke.

1112 2018-08-06 14:27:04 Love that! the talk around the block is that if you're new to that sort of investment, a safer bet would be mutual funds/ISAs...& as beginner, trading stocks may not be the best idea.. or at least don't play the market.. do let me what tips you get from your books 
1113 2018-08-06 14:26:04 Risk management is for stocks, there is no 'risk management' in crypto. You dump your cash and pray for the best, it could fall overnight or skyrocket. You can't tell, most of it is dodgy pump and dumps from Telegram groupchats.

1121 2018-08-06 14:18:31 I'm not saying "arrest everyone with guns." How about ban bump stocks & AR-15-type weapons, longer waiting periods, more stringent background checks, no guns for domestic abusers, stricter licensing/education, trigger locks, safe storage, etc. I bet you're cool with all those.
1122 2018-08-06 14:18:04 When did I say it was going to benefit any stocks? I never said that. Who ever said that putting in prison is good for an active citizen? The ASM list is similar to that.
1123 2018-08-06 14:16:56 Stocks were mostly higher on Friday after another positive jobs report. All of the major indexes were up for the week. And the Dow and the S&P are now up 5 weeks in a row - the longest winning stretch of the year.
1124 2018-08-06 14:16:43 SEBI is only the one putting all the stocks in the list. So where else can anyone go and complain? No one knows the actual reasons also. SEBI probably wants to ensure that its staffers do some work for the salary paid. Hence, the ASM & other mechanisms.

1133 2018-08-06 14:11:02 Apple is now a "trillion dollar company". So what does that actually mean? Its market capitalization, or the value of all of its stock shares added together, now exceeds $1 trillion. So if you wanted to own 100% of the company, you would need to pay $1 trillion.

1138 2018-08-06 14:08:32 Desperation is believing Twitter & FB stocks are going up and down depending on that, instead of earning statements. Also, Twitter YTD is up and outperforming the market. FB YTD is slightly up - performing as the market.
1139 2018-08-06 14:08:24 $HMNY BEARS WANT BULLS TO USE STOP LOSSES WHEN THE PRICE GOES UP, SO THEY CAN TRIGGER THE AUTOMATIC SELLS AS THEY PUSH DOWN TO SCARE #INVESTORS. This is how the Bears use the bull to drop the price faster when they dump. Try adding small limit buys, rather than stop losses.
1140 2018-08-06 14:08:09 You talking about the Chinese stocks, the yuan or Wall Street?

1143 2018-08-06 14:07:47 Why do you always buy stocks? There are two sides to the market, and if you
intend to speculate, you may as well get the benefit of the declines as well as the
advances.
1144 2018-08-06 14:07:28 Why can you not do option trading on @degiroeu for stocks within the Nasdaq, you can only option trade the Nasdaq if that makes sense.
1145 2018-08-06 14:07:16 Nice buy. Remember that the day off trade is usually intraday. Half the time stocks give it back but if u sell at the high gives u a dip with a lower cost basis

1167 2018-08-06 13:55:17 Agree with the normal. On the otherhand I buy stocks like I buy ETFs to keep them for at least 7 years. Most of my investments are index ETFs but my long term stocks have done really well so far. Active trading is far different than buying quality companies with a long-term view.

1183 2018-08-06 13:51:07 Hi Naresh one query some stocks like Rain give a fast bounce from support levels but few others consolidate for a while around the support before moving up. Is it possible to guess what may happen based on charts?
1184 2018-08-06 13:50:39 Well when inaction seems like to go 2 for your organization and your against legislation that protects kids to me its only natural your stocks tumble and your organization falls.

1193 2018-08-06 13:44:06 Yeah, one would think the ranking to be highly correlated to applying a low-vol filter/FIP algorithm or alike. A bit worried that would (comp. to usual 12-2 mom):
1) Tilt away from Small Cap
2) After already filtering for value, very few stocks left with any absolute OK momentum.

1303 2018-08-06 12:41:10 Realized volatility in stocks is....like....effing nothing. Trade them for 10 ticks and that is that.
1304 2018-08-06 12:41:07 Wages are flat or lower, so the cost to produce things is down and the stocks can rise. Wages are flat or low because the American worker is losing power, including the power to bargain. Also, more women are entering the workforce and we do not pay women as much as men.

1313 2018-08-06 12:34:06 Many thanks for your reply. 

It's frustrating watching crap stocks get pumped, only to have stocks like this sold off into good announcements, as you say. Then again, my stellar performers were all unloved and ignored at various times. Traders' vs investors' dilemma, I guess.
1314 2018-08-06 12:34:05 Not true anymore.. There are stocks bleeding badly even in this euphoria.
1315 2018-08-06 12:33:09 @iManasArora Hi Sir, Please correct me if wrong. 7-10% SL might work in some stocks. But if Its at major support & below it will fall like rock is it advisable to do so. e.g. Motherson had great support at 300/- and below that it touched 280/- in this scenario what should one do.

1317 2018-08-06 12:31:30 If several $ billion can be printed to buy stocks and make bankers happy, it's going to be hard to argue that central planning can't be applied to other sectors.
1318 2018-08-06 12:31:06 NY didn’t ban Rifles, I wish the NRA and other folks will stop saying that. You can still purchase ARs here. They just restricted certain parts. No collapsible stocks, no flash hiders, no pistol grips ( I agree that’s ridiculous), no magazines over 7 rounds.
1319 2018-08-06 12:30:30 Bonjour, oui tout à fait. L'opération anti-gaspi est une opération nationale qui a lieu tous les jours à l'ouverture des magasins. Sachez que les produits proposés doivent avoir une DLC correcte pour consommation. Cette opération proposée dans la limite des stocks disponibles.

1323 2018-08-06 12:29:46 Don't conflate inside trading of stocks, which connotes a direct tangible monetary benefit derived from such actions, with receiving information from a foreign person that embarrasses a political enemy.

The two are not equivalent.

1336 2018-08-06 12:18:28 That would be ridiculous to require a President to divest their holdings. If they do that then Congress should have to sell theirholdings including the stocks.

1349 2018-08-06 12:08:13 #adaniports confusing results. Dont know how to read these numbers.
1350 2018-08-06 12:08:02 People who tout the benefits of investing in individual stocks typically say something like

"If you bought [STOCK X] in [SOME YEAR IN THE 1990s] you would have [LARGE NUMBER] times your initial investment by now."

Yes, but you probably would have sold when the stock went up 50%
1351 2018-08-06 12:07:19 Stock buybacks should've remained an illegal activity. It only benifits the richest 10% who own 90% of the stocks. And it sucks wealth out of the real economy.
1352 2018-08-06 12:07:10 **Exception to taking profit at 20 to 25%**

8-week Hold Rule: 
hold on to stocks for at least 8 weeks if it reaches 20% within two to three weeks from its proper breakout.

This rule helps you sit through minor sell offs and avoid exiting too soon.

1356 2018-08-06 12:01:53 Jag, You’re absolutely correct, and you make a great point for the the people wasting their money on the NRA. Gun controls need to be put in place for certain weapons. Bump stocks should have been outlawed the day after the Las Vegas massacre. That doesn’t mean “repeal the 2A”
1357 2018-08-06 12:01:17 "the 2nd amendment was for muskets and flint-stocks" lol where does that state that.

1530 2018-08-06 09:26:32 Consolidation time. Last 6 months a lot of stocks had corrected but these two held their fort. Now money moving to stocks that had corrected a lot for quick gains. Money would eventually come back where earnings are. So, just have patience.

1878 2018-08-06 03:11:07 Unfortunately going the private equity route seems to be the path of least resistance these days--especially for small caps. While I agree that publicly traded stocks must be regulated, the cost of these regulations to companies makes it unattractive.

1884 2018-08-06 03:07:27 But their rebalance was at the EXACT wrong time.  The have been selling the stocks that will skyrocket with higher U3O8 price.

1887 2018-08-06 03:05:34 We have been documenting and watching them sell out of U stocks since 4/1 and now it is 8/5.  It is not nearly the same ETF.  Rebalance means remake.  Or, change.  So, a changed ETF should have diff expectations than what it did for the last 5 years.  It rebalanced for a reason.

So, if they had went from 8 mil sh of UUUU to 3 mil and replaced with a falling gold stock while UUUU shot up 65% in 3 weeks why expect it to trend like '17?

2031 2018-08-06 01:36:51 Dont know the stock, Im assuming your referring to the ponzi scheme business model of new capital constantly added to fund the losses. These #stocks are direct effect of very loose monetary policy by CB's as there is no yield on cash.
2032 2018-08-06 01:34:57 #Apple unlike most US #tech #stocks is not expensive, the issue is a lack of tech edge now that Jobs is not driving creativity & new products & ideas similar to the last time. Therefore profits most likely will fall as they become irrelevant over time & price rises effect demand.
2033 2018-08-06 01:30:41 $SPY Often traders get convinced to be investors on stocks that are flying high, that is until they don't.  What you need is a better plan.
2034 2018-08-06 01:29:57 sorry but seongwu still owns 80% of the stocks of my heart
2035 2018-08-06 01:29:50 I’m trying to help educate you because if your view is airlines have incredible pricing power that’s not supported by the facts this year - I’m bullish because I think eventually pricing firms / the stocks are cheap and buffet might try to take one private
2036 2018-08-06 01:29:30 They cut taxes and companies bought back stocks and gave share holders and board of directors big $$. Not much went to workers! Give money directly to workers. Don’t expect companies to care. They follow the bottom line!!!
2037 2018-08-06 01:28:10 Yes I've noticed, Cybersecurity stocks are being sold off. I sold #CYBR about 4 weeks ago, for a pretty good profit.
I'm gonna continue to keep my eye on the Cybersecurity Sector, when the times right I'll come back in.
I still think there's a lot of upward movement.
2038 2018-08-06 01:25:57 Im not talking about stocks...
2039 2018-08-06 01:25:37 Oh god, please tell me you set the match to at least two stocks right!???
2040 2018-08-06 01:25:18 Can you expand on why you think they’re a weird compromise?

Also, a lot of those small-cap stocks in the 90s were absolute trash.
2041 2018-08-06 01:24:14 4) To top it all off, Grand Finals consisted of 2 whole minutes of stalling (both players charging Bullet Climax and talking amonst each other; organizers literally had to tell them to play) and mild collusion ("homie stocks" [Giving up a stock because the other player SD'd])
2042 2018-08-06 01:23:26 NO ONE WAS ATTACKING HOMIE STOCKS THOUGH. Homie stocks are like an unspoken rule
2043 2018-08-06 01:22:28 the reins sees the white// she follows  the apathetic chromium with hand// the hand uses the cranky sky of stocks --  the astonished night becomes the eye with swimmer/ the dismayed canonization blows the perky time with accounting
2044 2018-08-06 01:22:04 I dunno if you can call it freedom of expression when it's deliberately wasting time at an already busy event though

like the homie stocks and stuff were fine but just stalling like that shows nothing but disrespect for everyone involved
2045 2018-08-06 01:21:23 Asian stocks rose on Monday after China's central bank took steps to try to drag the yuan away from 14-month lows, but the tit-for-tat conflict over Sino-U.S. trade hung heavily on markets

2049 2018-08-06 01:19:01 I mean like Ikon, Winner Bigbang, Blackpink and Seungri has been making the stocks go up but what the f he's doing, wasting money,money that his groups gained?
2050 2018-08-06 01:15:51 3 of the characters in top 4 were Bayonetta, a char with fraudulent win conditions that nobody likes. During finals, they sandbagged, stalled & traded stocks which made it look like collusion

Not really appropriate to boo kids, but a poor showing from competitors. Bad all around

2055 2018-08-06 01:09:54 Well it’s kind of the same thing... once the stocks trade down the small ETF companies turn CF negative and unwind their indexes... which puts further pressure on the mkt and causes a cascade to the next round of ETF companies
2056 2018-08-06 01:09:53 Further research by UBS suggests economists in Australia continue to overstate inflation outlook. UBS retains below consensus CPI forecasts, plus sees RBA on hold until 2020 #ausbiz #ausecon #XJO #investing #stocks

Stocks fund retirement accounts...people live off those funds.  You are lying to your constituents.

Hey Andrew :) could you give me a few cheaper stocks to invest in? Not looking for a get rich quick thing, I know it doesn't work that way. But I need to use a little capital to build more for real investing. Any tips would be much appreciated. :) thank you!

2070 2018-08-06 00:57:08 @Scaramucci Trump has declared war on Democracy. That’s what strongman attacks on the press are. So what @realDonaldTrump acchievements are worth forfeiting democracy? The economy? Stocks? DPRK? Iran? This country will never be the same.

2074 2018-08-06 00:56:07 The 1% LOVE debt & low taxes. They make money on that debt via bond interest & dividends on bank stocks (along with what they make on outsourcing). Why pay taxes when you can make a profit on debt? Notice how debt is only an issue at election time?

2076 2018-08-06 00:53:34 I don't thin children should be killed in school. My grandson enters kindergarten and will learn to hide for "active shooter" situations.  Bump stocks and AR15 must go.

2078 2018-08-06 00:51:03 Day 69: Kristen really helped me get out of a very bad situation. I won’t go into full details but let’s say I gambled ALOT in stocks and lost. And kept trying to get it back and kept losing more. Idk what I’d do if Kristen didn’t finally get me to stop. (1/2)
2079 2018-08-06 00:50:59 Makes sense. The CEO gets part of his pay and retirement in stocks so when they get big bucks he would invest them back into stocks. He is basically giving himself a big ol' raise.

2082 2018-08-06 00:46:14 Bro where can I get started with stocks, I’m trying to get familiar with it too. How did you start learning? Classes? Books?
2083 2018-08-06 00:46:09 I’m a farmer, we haven’t been hurt yet, I doubt we will! Our prices are down, because of huge grain stocks! And we had many years of record profits! Not many businesses are profitable all the time! Don’t blame The tariffs!
2084 2018-08-06 00:46:06 Imo bayo, doubles cloud, and the fact the game is so voliatile and only played on two stocks are all huge reasons.
2085 2018-08-06 00:45:39 Obama economic policy was 8 years of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve that pumped $4.5 trillion into the US economy, flooded commercial banks with excess liquidity; it was quantitative easing promoted private lending, leaving them with large stocks of excess reserves
2086 2018-08-06 00:44:21 It funny but I have yet to come more than one or two anti-gun people in the Resistance. Pretty sure 2A doesn’t protect bump stocks and AR-15s.

2090 2018-08-06 00:40:54 Show a list then
Jobs? Obama created more
Unemployment? Was at 4.8% 
Stocks? Almost tripled under Obama
Tax cuts? Mostly for the rich
N Korea? Still building nukes
Russia? Still hacking our election
Tariffs? Hurting farmers
ISIS? Same plan Obama implemented

So what has he done?

2092 2018-08-06 00:40:09 Agree with this but would add context to say that you have to buy strong stocks when they experience weakness and sell weak stocks when they experience strength.

2100 2018-08-06 00:31:48 I’m into investing and sometimes you make bad investments & lose money so maybe our in state schools have done some of this over the years. Once you fully understand stocks you make money when the market is up or down. Maybe these guys don’t fully understand the dynamics
2101 2018-08-06 00:30:44 Value investors typically loathe the crazy high PE growth darling stocks.

I have noticed a few renowned value investors have actually had some positive things to say about $APT recently, makes me even more bullish!
2102 2018-08-06 00:30:43 Bentley trucks look like bullshit on stocks they look better with rims
2103 2018-08-06 00:30:35 This scenario satisfies the bond - stocks - commodities rotation.   Bonds topped in July of 2016.  The stock market likely topped at the beginning of this year.  Commodities should have one last blast to the upside.  Dr #copper  looking bullish on the weekly.

2108 2018-08-06 00:25:32 Stocks? Ok
2109 2018-08-06 00:25:00 You mean people manipulating prices for personal gain? People do this in any facet of their life they can. Day traders for stocks been known to do the same thing, though the pumps are not as great, or are they ?
2110 2018-08-06 00:22:35 I call bullshit on high ending stocks. Guys have bills to pay. Only stock in bins is lentils. But I might be wrong.
2111 2018-08-06 00:21:50 #Stockmarket If the #SPX run plays out and Dollar falls. In next 7 years SPX could be 12000 and Dow 113000. Inflation directed to Mkts. SPX and TNX no longer protect each other. Stocks break loose.
2112 2018-08-06 00:21:43 I'm going long in air-conditioner stocks.
2113 2018-08-06 00:18:20 And more and more mutual funds buying the smaller number of companies stocks.

2115 2018-08-06 00:16:10 I recall $HMNY this week.  Extremely risky, high short interest.  The risk is what deters me from trading stocks like this.
2116 2018-08-06 00:15:40 Fully semi um ok its funny but bump stocks whats going on with bump stocks I think if something could be called fully semi this is it . Semiautomatic yep first round in a second every round after .5 hell modified I could get it down to 3 rounds a second
2117 2018-08-06 00:14:12 Corporate America isn’t hiring enough or doing r&d and investing.  It’s been buying back stocks with cheap credit to maintain share prices but the fundamentals aren’t good.
2118 2018-08-06 00:12:51 Honestly I think the real reason is to prevent sneaky stuff. People go to sleep suddenly all the stock drops like crazy because a rich insomniac sold all their stocks
2119 2018-08-06 00:09:24 And there are more funds than stocks.
2120 2018-08-06 00:02:38 Very true. Irish have a love of property. UK investors more mature and spread investement over stocks, shares, pensions and property. Regular folk in Ireland lost the plot and piled into buy to rent. Folk got crucified.
All boiled down to greed sadly
2121 2018-08-06 00:01:35 Futures markets are pointing to an opening rise for stocks, with the Hang Seng set to bounce hardest. Trading across the region may be boosted by lower local currencies, and the yuan rate set today will be closely watched. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
