3 2018-12-26 23:22:38 You’re gonna get heat for this but you have a point. Also can’t neglect the value of connections. I can call up buddies working for NASA, hedge funds, crypto companies, commodities companies, and so much more

10 2018-12-26 22:46:43 No, you are not making America great again, you are making back room deals on commodities you are putting tariffs on like soybeans, steel, and aluminum. When all along you intent was for other countries to get the profits like Russia selling soybeans to china now.

39 2018-12-26 21:47:41 Market has been greatly oversold. There is a lot of undervaluation out there and time to buy. That said, the Fed has really screwed the country this past six months.

41 2018-12-26 21:38:40 You don't abolish the production of "the commodity"
you abolish the production of goods AS COMMODITIES. 

Taking a good and making a profit of it, is commodity production. 

Which is what the USSR did.
42 2018-12-26 21:37:36 I tend to follow some basic pretty stacking rules, especially as the lion's share of my posting lately has been cross realm arbitrage of highly fluid commodities like Anchor Weed. So, I'll look for the 20 stack, undercut that one with say 10 stacks of 20. And so on.
43 2018-12-26 21:35:02 Because they don't live here... Housing and other commodities don't just magically appear when people cross the border. I mean, what did anyone expect to have happen?
44 2018-12-26 21:34:03 You don't abolish the commodities that's not what "commodity production" is

Like you're just taking the surface meaning  which is extremely revealing you don't know what this means. 

Commodity production means producing solely for the purpose of export to earn a profit.
45 2018-12-26 21:31:24 Crypto markets are not any more "real" than stocks and futures.People are betting on the future value of some icos and the future use of digital coins. Commodities are the purest form of markets. That is until today. There is a lot of price manipulation still going on on crypto

Do yo austerity measures consider priorities?
54 2018-12-26 20:30:24 Mostly, they are commodities, unless you really care, I feel like.
55 2018-12-26 20:27:46 Equities, bonds, real estate, commodities. All assets decline in value when real risk free rates are too high because it encourages people to move into cash/treasuries and out of everything else.
56 2018-12-26 20:17:27 Nigerians stop the foolish habit of increasing prices on all commodities & transportations during festive periods without govt involvement!
57 2018-12-26 20:16:24 Socialism isn't the abolishment of commodities, or literally goods that simply have fucking value, like seriously? Words actually mean things, which seems to be news to you.
58 2018-12-26 20:13:11 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
59 2018-12-26 20:08:26 Ah, mas tem o sistema de Israel ...

69 2018-12-26 19:22:23 It lowers wages under capitalism but wage labor would be abolished under socialism. The issue is that workers are considered commodities with associated costs rather than business partners that share in the generated value

73 2018-12-26 18:57:16 That’s why the more-regulated Euro ethic (vs less-regulated US one) should be strengthened. The derivative commodities allowed in the US and UK were a huge cause, right?

Unregulated banking will always turn into a lot of profitable smoke-and-mirrors that serves no one. Always.

92 2018-12-26 17:02:33 I know! It is disappointing people who are supposed to be managing people’s retirement aren’t concerned. My advice is reduce debt hoard commodities like gold.
93 2018-12-26 16:59:32 This is sick. Human beings aren't commodities, selling oneself doesn't make it better.
94 2018-12-26 16:55:55 I certainly will! Thanks! Started a new job two weeks ago as a commodities manager with a local mfg company. Been very hectic. The expectations are high, so my game needs to be on point. Also, it’s a challenge leading change and working with a new group to convince buy in.

96 2018-12-26 16:53:51 Interesting interpretation Martyn.

Along with public announcements in local language  please make the prices of commodities including food items in the airport also consumer friendly.

Thank you for your efforts to increase awareness, love your work.

107 2018-12-26 16:15:59 Oh, that sounds fascinating! I'm not sure how much use my article would be to you, then, as it's all about sexual knowledge (and really nothing about labor/commodities), but I do talk about both Nashe and Aretino. If you'll dm me your email I'll send it along.
108 2018-12-26 16:13:27 That'd be wonderful! I would love to read it. At the moment, I'm writing about Nashe, Aretino, and what I see as Nashe's anxiety about being turned into a commodity, along with his understanding of labor in the production of commodities.

110 2018-12-26 16:08:46 Understand your point just looking at the action of all industrial commodities, long end of the yield curve etc there is some question re how much control central bankers can have over generational macro trends. I think we take a lot for granted in assuming we can control

119 2018-12-26 15:15:07 Exatamente, o boom das commodities por si só não explica todo ganho em 14 anos. A crítica econômica à Venezuela vem na incapacidade de mudar a matriz produtiva nestes 14 anos. Mas a crítica à democracia vem depois da morte de Chávez.
120 2018-12-26 15:10:59 In Michigan the illegals use fake ID and pay taxes claiming large amount of dependents and getting huge refunds. Some in the family are getting paid under the table and get community commodities.
121 2018-12-26 15:09:22 What policies have the Dems enacted?  They currently control none of the three branches of government?   Stocks are global commodities.  The US does not individually control the markets.  Investors don’t like uncertainty.  That’s what we’re seeing.

123 2018-12-26 15:03:45 You are jumping the gun brother..

Nothing is global sir.

The Sudan you just talked about started last week and simply due to decisions from international lenders telling the president to remove subsidy from certain commodities.

This is unlike the Nigeria wahala. 
US is stable
124 2018-12-26 14:54:21 It’s almost like New York is a thousand miles north of SC and commodities have shipping costs too, in addition to the other points about road salt and repair.

129 2018-12-26 14:34:30 Resultado: Final do 1° Governo Dilma, preços das commodities caem brutalmente e real se desvaloriza vai de 1,70 para 4,00 reais. Energia, telefonia indexados ao IGP-M, sobem também. Gera uma inflação que não é de demanda. Dilma sobe os juros em 14%. Cartilha tripé macroeconômico.
130 2018-12-26 14:22:51 So except one's mother, sisters and wife  remaining girls / ladies will be looked at as commodities right. There were many incidents of masturbation in Public transport looking at women dressed in sarees / churidhars. It is the way one looks at women and not about the dress.
131 2018-12-26 14:19:18 Algunas cifras son peores, incluso, considerando que en los 90's los commodities no valían nada. Uruguay no tenía fuentes de ingresos como las que disfruta hoy.

165 2018-12-26 09:28:07 Depends on how rapidly crypto becomes relevant. Some commodities e.g. Uranium will do well even in this bear market as as demand for power rises with rise in battery driven cars. "IF" crypto gets mainstream fast enough, it will increasingly get seen as a hedge, hence bullish.
166 2018-12-26 09:26:22 I was blue in my face saying buy gold for 6 months now. It was painful to keep on holding gold while dollar was rising. Sold my TLT and NUGT position last week for profit. UGLD still rising with GLD pushing to previous highs. What’s with oil and commodities falling? Recession?
167 2018-12-26 09:24:17 Following the #SudanProtests #SudanUprising in 2011, Bashir had vowed not to contest for elections in 2015 only for him to rescind his decision.

168 2018-12-26 09:24:15 It will be very peaceful, less crime,less traffic as you have in your pix and above all relative decrease in prices of most commodities as can be observed in other Yoruba state.
169 2018-12-26 09:17:17 When you invest in stocks, commodities or other financial actives, you want as little volatility as possible (unless you are a chartist, in which case you are probably already working with crypto).

170 2018-12-26 09:16:36 So true Chris. We have holdover 20th century rural policy geared towards commodities not innovation. The Germans seemed to have learn this lesson and built their rural regions on a 21st century vision of #innovation.
171 2018-12-26 09:04:30 So daughters are commodities that get passed around from family to family, yet sons remain belonging to their parents. 

And what happens if the daughters aren’t married? They no longer have a say in their OWN family’s affairs?

210 2018-12-26 02:40:15 The reason I do not believe in a apocalypse of stock markets is because I have not seen the euphoria of 1992, 2000, 2008 at all. Only time will tell. Look at where we are from then. The stock and commodities markets have survived the Ice Age and the Plague epidemics of Europe.
211 2018-12-26 02:10:21 1/ of That because you can no longer get market efficiency without monolpolization. Not all commodities behave the same. When your demand curve is inelastic you will never get a functional market. We are simply doing this in the most inefficient way possible.
212 2018-12-26 02:08:43 Years ago instead of food stamps or EBT cards, the govt gave out "commodities." Blocks of cheese, bags of flour and corn meal, powdered milk, powdered eggs, canned meat, etc.
